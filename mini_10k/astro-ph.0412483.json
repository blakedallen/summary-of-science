INTRODUCTION\n\nOur understanding of the origin of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) has continued to advance rapidly in the\nyears since the first X-ray (Costa et al. 1997), optical (van Paradijs et al. 1997) and radio (Frail et al.\n1997) afterglows were discovered.\nIn particular\nthe nearby afterglow from GRB 030329 has solidified\nthe GRB-supernova connection (Hjorth et al. 2003a;\nMatheson et al. 2003), and provided the first GRB\nwith a well determined expansion rate (Taylor et al.\n2004). This event has presented a unique opportunity\nto test afterglow models (Oren, Nakar, & Piran 2004;\nGranot, Ramirez-Ruiz & Loeb 2005), and to explore the\nenvironment around a GRB.\nAfterglow models invoke gas-rich environments around\nat least some of the GRBs. Several basic properties of\nthis circumburst medium are presently unknown, and\nneed to be addressed in order to better understand the\nafterglow and its evolution. For example, in the simplest\nemission models, the density of the ambient medium is\nrelated to the afterglow flux density (Waxman 1997). Especially, if GRBs exist in both gas-poor and gas-rich environments, that could explain why afterglow is absent\nin some GRBs. Direct observations of the circumburst\nmedium associated with GRBs would thus provide an\nimportant test of the fireball model.\nAnother issue is the density profile of the medium into\nwhich the GRB ejecta expands. Current models postulate a medium in which density is governed by the\nmass-loss of the progenitor star (\u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 ). At present\nhowever, some observations instead point to a uniform\ndensity in order to explain the evolution of the afterglow\nlightcurve (Berger et al. 2003). In a few cases, strong\ndamped Ly\u03b1 absorption has been found indicating Hi\n1 Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Menlo\nPark, CA 94025\n2 National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro, NM 87801\n3 National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center, Arecibo Observatory, Arecibo, PR 00612\n4 Owens Valley Radio Observatory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125\n\ncolumn densities as high as 5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (Hjorth et al.\n2003b). During the expansion of the GRB ejecta, the circumburst medium is likely to go through different stages\nof ionization. Perna & Loeb (1998) suggest that as a consequence (optical) absorption lines will vary in their EW\nwith time. The rate of this variation can constrain the\nsize of the absorbing region. Similarly, in the radio the\nfraction of molecular and atomic gas should be governed\nby the effective ionization, and might therefore vary in a\nsimilar way.\nOne way to investigate the circumburst medium is via\natomic or molecular absorption studies in the radio. Another way is to measure the deceleration of the expanding fireball. In this paper we present both late time\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations\nof the afterglow of GRB 030329 and similar epoch Hi\nand OH absorption observations taken with the Arecibo\ntelescope.\nAssuming a Lambda cosmology with H0\n=\n71 km/s/Mpc, \u03a9M = 0.27 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, the\nangular-diameter distance of GRB 030329 at z = 0.1685\nis dA = 589 Mpc, and 1 milliarcsec corresponds to 2.85\npc.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS\n2.1. Late Time VLBI Observations\nThe VLBI observations were taken at 8.4 GHz on 2003\nNovember 1, 217 days after the burst, with a global array\nincluding the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the\nNRAO5 . Other telescopes used were the Effelsberg 100-m\ntelescope6 , the phased VLA, the Green Bank Telescope\n(GBT), the 305 m Arecibo telescope7 , the Westerbork\n5 The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is operated by\nAssociated Universities, Inc., under cooperative agreement with\nthe National Science Foundation.\n6 The 100-m telescope at Effelsberg is operated by the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie in Bonn.\n7 The Arecibo Observatory is part of the National Astronomy\nand Ionosphere Center, which is operated by Cornell University\nunder a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f2\n\nTaylor et al.\nTABLE 1\nObservational Summary\nDate\n20 Jun 2003\n1 Nov 2003\n1 Nov 2003\n30 Nov 2003\n30 Nov 2003\n30 Nov 2003\n\n\u2206t\n(days)\n\nFrequency\n(GHz)\n\nInteg.

In all\nsome 56 individual and combined antennas each of 25m\nor more in diameter were employed with a combined collecting area of 0.12 km2 . Most antennas were on-source\nfor a period of 5.5 hours. All stations recorded with\n256 Mbps with 2 bit sampling in dual circular polarization with the exception of Noto which had only a rightcircular polarization receiver available. The observations\nwere correlated at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe\n(JIVE).\nThe nearby (1.5\u25e6 ) source J1051+2119 was used\nfor phase-referencing with a 2:1 minute cycle on\nsource:calibrator. The weak calibrator J1048+2115 was\nobserved hourly to check on the quality of the phase referencing. Self-calibration with a 1 hour solution interval\nwas used to further refine the calibration and remove\nsome slow-changing atmospheric phase errors. The final image has an rms noise of 24 \u03bcJy/beam. This is\nsubstantially higher than the expected thermal noise of\n8\u03bcJy/beam, in part because of partial loss of signals from\nArecibo and Westerbork for reasons not completely understood.\nWe fit a symmetric, two-dimensional Gaussian to the\nmeasured visibilities on GRB 030329 and find a size of\n0.176 \u00b1 0.08 mas. As in Taylor et al. (2004) the error\nof the size is estimated from signal-to-noise ratios and\nfrom Monte-Carlo simulations of the data using identical\n(u,v) coverage, similar noise properties, and a Gaussian\ncomponent of known size added. The standard deviation\nof the recovered sizes, modelfitted in the same way as we\ntreat the observations, was found to be 0.053 mas.\nWe also obtain a position for GRB 030329 of R.A.\n10h 44m 49.95955s and Dec. 21\u25e6 31'17.4377\" with an uncertainty of 0.2 mas in each coordinate. Solving for\nproper motion using all the high frequency VLBI observations to date, we derive \u03bcr.a. = \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.41 mas\nyr\u22121 and \u03bcdec. = \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.41 mas yr\u22121 , or an angular displacement over the first 217 days of 0.14\u00b10.35\nmas (Fig. 1). These observations are consistent with\nthose reported by Taylor et al. (2004), and impose an\neven stronger limit on the proper motion. This limit argues against the cannonball model for GRBs proposed\nby Dado, Dar & De Rujula (2004).\n2.2. Single Dish Arecibo Observations\n\nSingle dish observations of GRB 030329 were carried\nout with the L-band Wide receiver of the 305 m Arecibo\n\nRadio Telescope on 2003 November 30, for a total of 2 hr.\nThe simple position-switched observations utilized all\nfour interim correlator boards to observe various L-band\nfrequencies. The bandwidth of each board was 12.5 MHz.\nWhile the first two boards were set to observe the frequency of the redshifted \u03bb21 cm H I line, recording each\nlinear polarization with 2048 spectral channels, the other\ntwo boards were set to observe simultaneously the orthogonal polarizations at the frequencies of the redshifted\n\u03bb18 cm mainline OH transitions (1665 & 1667 MHz) and\nthe 1720 MHz satellite OH transition with 1024 spectral\nchannels per polarization.\nFollowing the editing out of data suffering from radio\nfrequency interference, the total on-source integration\ntime for the redshifted \u03bb21 cm H I and the 1720 MHz\nsatellite OH transitions was 30 min each. For the redshifted \u03bb18 cm mainline OH transitions, the on-source\nintegration time was 50 min.\n3. CONSTRAINTS ON THE ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR\nGAS\n\n3.1. Limits on Absorption\n\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 show pairs of total-intensity spectra of the GRB 030329 centered at the optical heliocentric velocity that corresponds to the frequency of the\nredshifted \u03bb21 cm H I line, the redshifted \u03bb18 cm OH\nmainlines, and the redshifted \u03bb18 cm OH satellite line at\n1720 MHz, respectively.\nThe top spectra in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, are Hanningsmoothed with spectral resolutions of 3.52 km s\u22121\n(12.2 kHz), 5.99 km s\u22121 (24.4 kHz), and 5.80 km s\u22121\n(24.4 kHz), respectively. The rms noise level in each\nof these spectra is 1.02, 0.32, and 0.57 mJy beam\u22121 ,\nrespectively. The bottom plot in each figure is a fivechannel smoothed version of the respective top spectra.\nThe velocity resolution in these spectra is 8.80, 14.98, and\n14.50 km s\u22121 , and the rms noise level of each spectrum\nis 0.482, 0.224, and 0.282 mJy beam\u22121 , respectively.\nNo emission or absorption is seen in any of the Arecibo\nspectra. We can derive a 3\u03c3 limit on the Hi opacity\nof \u03c4 < 0.53 with a velocity resolution of 8.8 km s\u22121 .\nThis corresponds to a Hi column density limit of NH <\n8.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 assuming a spin temperature of 100 K,\nand uniform coverage. If the spin temperature is higher\nor the line is shallow and wide, then this limit could be\nhigher. Given the extreme energies involved in the GRB,\nenough to cause a sudden ionospheric disturbance in the\nEarth's atmosphere (Schnoor et al. 2003) some 740 Mpc\n\n\fLate time radio observations of GRB 030329\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- The positions derived from the observations in six epochs relative to the first determination on April 1st at 8.4 GHz. Observations\nat multiple frequencies at a given epoch have been plotted separately since they are independent measurements. A circle with a radius\nof 0.26 mas (2\u03c3) is shown to encompass all measurements except those taken at 5 GHz, which suffer from systematic errors (Taylor et al.\n2004). Taken together these observations provide a constraint on the proper motion of 0.14 \u00b1 0.35 mas over 217 days.\n\nOur measured size of 0.176 \u00b1 0.08 mas is quite close to\nthe size of 0.172 \u00b1 0.043 found by Taylor et al. (2004),\nindicating a possible slowing of the burst at late times.\nThis trend was already apparent from the average expansion velocities derived from the angular size measurements on April 22 and June 20. The entire history of expansion for GRB 030329 is shown in Fig. 5.\nThe first measurement at 15 days comes from a modeldependent estimate of the quenching of the scintillation\n(Berger et al. 2003).

Further research in this area is needed.\nIn a similar manner we can place a 3\u03c3 upper limit on\nthe 1667 MHz OH mainline opacity of \u03c4 < 0.11 with a\nvelocity resolution of 15.0 km s\u22121 . This corresponds to\nan OH column density limit of NOH < 1.4 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122\nassuming a uniform covering factor, and an excitation\ntemperature of 10 K. We can further deduce a limit on\nmolecular hydrogen using the relation NH2 \u223c 107 NOH\n(Kanekar & Chengalur 2002), of NH2 < 1.4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\nThe continuum flux density of the GRB 030329 at\n1.4 GHz at the time of these observations was \u223c 3.5 mJy.\nThe various spectra reported here show a higher continuum flux density, because of a 15 mJy continuum source\nlocated at an angular distance of about 3 arcmin from\nthe GRB 030329, i.e., within the primary beam of the\nArecibo radio telescope.\n\nFig.\n2.- Redshifted \u03bb21 cm H I spectra toward the\nGRB 030329.\nThe top spectrum is Hanning-smoothed with\n\u22121\n3.52 km s\n(12.2 kHz) spectral resolution.

Alternatively, it is possible (but somewhat contrived) that the\nintrinsic surface brightness profile has changed in a way\nto compensate for the expansion.

Beyond that they predict a fairly\nconstant density out to the red supergiant shell at a radius of 1.7 pc. With a current diameter of 0.5 pc for\nGRB 030329 (radius of 0.25 pc) at day 217 it is near\nthe termination shock, especially if the progenitor had\na shorter lifetime, or a relatively high density ISM has\nstalled the shock.\n\n0.002\n0.000\n\nB\n\nFig. 3.- Redshifted \u03bb18 cm OH mainline spectra toward\nthe GRB 030329.

(2004) derived a 3\u03c3 limit on the linear polarization of 0.16 mJy/beam, corresponding to a limit on\nthe fractional polarization of <1.0%. In a contemporaneous optical observation Greineret al. (2003) measure a\npolarization of 2.2+/-0.3%. The decrease in polarization\nat lower frequencies has been explained as the result of\nthe source being optically thick at 8.4 GHz at these early\ntimes since the maximum degree of linear polarization of\nan optically thick synchrotron source is 12% while the\nmaximum polarization of an optically thin synchrotron\nsource is about 80% (Pacholczyk 1970). To look for any\nchange in polarization with time as the source transitions to optically thin at 8.4 GHz we have analyzed the\nvery sensitive, late time phased VLA observations for polarimetry. We find no detection at either epoch and place\n3\u03c3 limits of <1.8% and <4.7% on 2003 Jun. 20 and 2003\nNov. 1 respectively. The total intensity measured with\nthe VLA on these epochs is 3.11 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.75 \u00b1 0.02\nmJy respectively.\nThe emission mechanism for the GRB afterglow is\nwidely accepted to be synchrotron radiation, which is\nintrinsically linearly polarized if there is an ordered component to the magnetic field, or if the magnetic field\nis generated at the internal shocks (Medvedev & Loeb\n1999).\nThe recent detection of 80 \u00b1 20% polarization in the prompt \u03b3-ray emission from GRB\n021206 (Coburn & Boggs 2003), although controversial\n(Rutledge & Fox 2004; Wigger et al. 2004), has led to\nan increased interest in modeling the time and frequency dependent behavior of the polarization from the\nafterglow (Nakar, Piran & Waxman 2003; Granot 2003;\nGranot & Taylor 2005).\nTo have an observed polarization of <5% in the late\ntime afterglow (see \u00a72.2) could be explained as the result\nof highly disordered magnetic fields (Granot & K\u00f6nigl\n2003).\nPropagation effects can also reduce the intrinsic linear\npolarization below detectable levels. A Faraday screen\nproduced by ionized gas and magnetic fields can cause\ngradients in the observed polarization angle across the\nsource, leading to depolarization if the resolution element\nof the telescope, or the size of the source if unresolved, is\nlarge compared to the gradients. The rotation measures\n(RM ) can be related to the line-of-sight magnetic field,\nBk , by\n\n\fLate time radio observations of GRB 030329\n\n5\n\nFig. 5.- The apparent expansion of GRB 030329 derived from measurements and limits on the angular size as a function of time.\nThe two upper limits at 7.7 and 51 days are from Taylor et al. (2004), as are the measurements on days 25 and 83 (open squares). The\nmeasurement on day 15 (filled circle) is a model dependent estimate based on the quenching of scintillation by Berger et al. (2003). Finally,\nthe measurement on day 217 (open square) comes from this work.\n\nRM = 812\n\nZL\n\nne Bk dl radians m\u22122 ,\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nwhere Bk is measured in mG, ne in cm\u22123 , dl in pc, and\nthe upper limit of integration, L, is the distance from\nthe emitting source to the end of the path through the\nFaraday screen along the line of sight. We can estimate\nthe minimum magnetic field needed to produce a gradient across the source. To produce a 90\u25e6 rotation at\n8.4 GHz requires a RM of 1200 rad m\u22122 . Assuming\na density within the red supergiant shell of 0.2 cm\u22123\n(Chevalier, Li, & Fransson 2004) and a path length of 2\npc, then the magnetic field strength required is Bk = 4\nmG. This field strength is similar to the equipartition\nfield strengths Dougherty et al. (2003) have found from\nmodeling the radio emission from colliding-wind WolfRayet (WR) binary systems, although the field strengths\nin these systems have probably been enhanced by the\ncollision. Faraday screens in the GRB environment are\nconsidered in more detail by Granot & Taylor (2005).\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWhile no detection of atomic (Hi) or molecular (OH)\nmaterial is found towards GRB 030329, the limits of\nNH < 8.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 are not particularly constraining. Observations of more shielded molecules like NH3\ntowards future bursts at early times would be of interest,\nand given the expected strength of a nearby afterglow of\n\n\u223c50 mJy or more, could yield detections, or place interesting limits on the amount of material in the GRB\nenvironment.\nAlthough GRB 030329 has faded considerably, it may\nstill be detectable with VLBI techniques. Even crude estimates of the size could differentiate between the predictions of wind and constant-density environments at these\nlate times. Radio re-brightening of GRB 030329 has\nbeen predicted by Granot & Loeb (2003), and Li & Song\n(2004) estimate a level of 0.6 mJy 1.7 years after the\nburst. This re-brightening might occur as the counterjet becomes non-relativistic and therefore radiatively\nisotropic. This brightening will be accompanied by a\ntemporary rapid growth in the size of the source as two,\nwell-separated jets become visible, and by a change in\nthe light centroid (Granot & Loeb 2003). If such a rebrightening occurs then a precise size estimate at late\ntimes becomes readily achievable with existing facilities.\nRather surprisingly, we find no detectable linear polarization from GRB 030329 at cm wavelengths to limits\nas low as 1%. This could indicate less order than expected in the magnetic fields of the external shock that\ndrives the afterglow, or a Faraday screen that depolarizes the radio emission. All of these limits are from 8\ndays or more after the burst. Given the RHESSI result\n(Coburn & Boggs 2003) of large polarization from the\n\u03b3-rays, and predictions of some fireball models, it would\nbe well worth searching for polarization from the prompt\noptical and radio emission (e.g., Granot & Taylor 2005).\n\n\f6\n\nTaylor et al.\n\nIn the near future the Swift satellite8 should dramatically increase the number of GRBs with measured redshifts, revealing some that are nearby. In future VLBI\nstudies of GRB afterglows at redshifts less than 0.1 it\nshould be possible to image the structure of the afterglow. Fireball models of heating by a single relativistic\nshock front predict that at late times the fireball should\nlook like a ring (Granot, Piran & Sari 1999).\n8\n\nGBT thanks the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology for hospitality and support.
