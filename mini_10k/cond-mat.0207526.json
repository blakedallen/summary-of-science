It\nis shown that \u221aat low magnetic fields B, the 2D single-vortex pinning and thermal fluctuations\nyield Jc \u221d (1/ d) exp[\u2212(dm /d)1/2 ], if the film thickness d is smaller than the pinning correlation\nlength along B. The model describes the dependence of Jc on d observed on Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 coated\nconductors for d < 2\u03bcm. Measurements of Jc (d) in strong magnetic fields are proposed to probe\nwhether the dependence of Jc on d is mostly determined by the 2D pinning or changes in the material\nmicrostructure as the film gets thicker.\nPACS numbers: PACS numbers: 74.20.De, 74.20.Hi, 74.60.-w\n\nCritical current densities Jc of superconducting films\nare typically much greater (by orders of magnitude) than\nthose of bulk conductors. This difference is usually ascribed to denser and stronger pinning defect microstructures in epitaxial films, lesser effect of current-blocking\nobstacles such as grain boundaries, microcracks, etc. A\ngeneral trend is that Jc (d) first increases as the film thickness d decreases, followed by a decrease of Jc and the critical temperature Tc for smaller d. This issue of what is\nbehind the size dependence of Jc is important for high-Tc\nmultifilamentary conductors and Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 (YBCO)\ncoated conductors, in which a significant degradation of\nJc (d) as the YBCO film thickness increases was reported\n[1, 2, 3]. This behavior of Jc (d) has been attributed to\nthe change of the microstructure as the YBCO film gets\nthicker, in particular, \"dead\" layers with reduced Tc and\nJc near the buffer layer and the surface, lesser epitaxy\nand the biaxial texture, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4]\nIn this Letter I propose an alternative approach, based\non the fact that pinning of vortices of finite length depends on the film thickness if it gets smaller than the bulk\npinning correlation length Lc along the field direction.\nFor bulk superconductors, Jc is determined by the balance of the Lorentz force JBVc /c and the pinning force\n(ni fp2 Vc )1/2 in the correlation volume Vc = Rc2 Lc , where\nRc is the correlation length transverse to the field direction, ni is the volume density of pinning centers, and\nfp is an elementary pinning force per pin [5]. If d becomes smaller than 2Lc, a crossover occurs from the 3D\nthickness-independent bulk pinning to the 2D collective\npinning for which Jc (d) depends on d [6, 7, 8, 9]. This\ntransition was indeed observed on N b3 Ge, M o3 Si [6, 7]\nand M ox Ge1\u2212x [9] films.\nFor a film of thickness d and width w in a perpendicular\nmagnetic field, the 2D collective pinning theory gives [8]\nc\u03b3\n[ln(2lc /Rc )/8\u03c0]1/2 ,\nBrp3 C66 d\n\n(1)\n\nRc = rp2 C66 [8\u03c0d/\u03b3 ln(2a/Rc )]1/2 .\n\n(2)\n\nJc =\n\nHere Rc is the pinning correlation length transverse to\nthe vortex lines, C66 \u2243 \u03c60 B(1 \u2212 b)2 /64\u03c0 2 \u03bb2 is the shear\nelastic modulus, \u03bb is the London penetration depth, lc =\n(C66 crp /BJc )1/2 , \u03c60 is the flux quantum, b = B/Bc2 , Bc2\nis the upper critical field, and c is the speed of light. The\nparameter \u03b3 = fp2 rp2 ni quantifies the pinning strength of\nrandomly distributed point defects, each acting on the\nvortex with the maximum force fp in the interaction radius rp . As follows from Eq. (1), the critical current\nIc = Jc dw is nearly independent of d. The condition of\nthe 2D pinning, d < 2Lc , has the form [6]\np\nd[\u03bcm] < 2B 1/4 [T esla]/ Jc [M A/cm2 ]\n(3)\n\nFor B = 1T and Jc = 1M A/cm2 , the transition from the\nthickness-independent 3D pinning Jc to the 2D pinning\nJc \u221d 1/d occurs for d below \u223c 2\u03bcm, in qualitative agreement with the experimental data on coated conductors\n[1, 2]. Thus, the dependence Jc (d) observed on coated\nconductors may be due to the crossover from the 3D to\n2D collective pinning, even if the pinning microstructure\nis unaffected by the film thickness.\nEqs. (1) and (2) correspond to high fields, for which\nRc is much greater than the intervortex spacing a =\n(\u03c60 /B)1/2 , and pinning-induced deformations of the vortex lattice are described by the continuum elasticity theory [8]. The condition R > a is equivalent to B > Bs ,\nwhere the crossover field Bs \u226a Bc2 can be found from\nEqs. (1) and (2):\nBs \u2243 (8\u03c0)3/2 Jc \u03bb2 /crp ln1/2 (2lc /R).\n\n(4)\n\nIf rp equals the coherence length \u03be (core pinning),\nJc = 1M A/cm2, \u03bb(77K) \u2243 0.6\u03bcm, \u03bb/\u03be = 100, and\nln(2lc /R) \u2248 1, Eq. (4) yields the crossover field Bs \u2243 7.6\nT much higher than the typical field range in which most\nof the Jc measurements on coated conductors have been\nperformed. So we turn to the 2D single-vortex pinning at\nlow fields B < Bs , for which the macroscopic elasticity\nof the vortex lattice is irrelevant.\n\n\f2\nWe first consider self-field limitations of Jc at zero field,\nand estimate a mean current density Jc1 = cBc1 /2\u03c0d\nwhich produces the parallel field equal to the lower critical field Bc1 = (\u03c60 /4\u03c0\u03bbab \u03bbc )[ln(\u03bb/\u03be) + 0.5] in the middle\nof the film. For typical YBCO parameters, \u03bbab (77) =\n0.6\u03bcm, \u03bbc /\u03bbab = 7, d = 2\u03bcm, Bc1 (77K) = 14.7 Oe,\nthe threshold value Jc1 is about 0.12M A/cm2. The soobtained lower critical current density Jc1 is an order of\nmagnitude lower than typical Jc values of coated conductors [1, 2], so the onset of dissipation at Jc is most\nlikely due to depinning of self-field vortices which penetrated the film at J \u226a Jc . However, the onset of flux\npenetration and the Jc1 values are strongly affected by\nthe surface and geometrical barriers which can be locally\nreduced by surface and edge defects in the YBCO film\nand buffer layer. Thus, Jc1 values can vary in a wide\nrange cBc1 /2\u03c0d < Jc1 < cBc /2\u03c0d, where the upper\n\u221a limit\ncorresponds to an ideal surface, and Bc = \u03c60 /2 2\u03c0\u03be\u03bb\nis the thermodynamic critical field. The self-field effects\ncould therefore contribute to the size dependence of Jc\nin zero field, but they disappear at higher fields much\ngreater than the full penetration field Bp \u2243 Jc d/c.\nNow we consider the 2D single-vortex pinning in a film\nin a perpendicular field B < Bs . For d < L, pinning only\ncauses overall displacements, but not distortions of vortex lines which thus remain nearly straight and perpendicular to the film surface. In this case even a rigid vortex of finite length d is pinned by randomly distributed\npoint defects, unlike an infinite sample where the pinning\nforce of a straight vortex in a random pinning potential is\nzero. Indeed, let the film thickness be much greater than\nthe mean spacing between the pinning centers, then the\nvortex interacts with N = rp2 dni pinning centers, adjusting its position so that the net pinning force vanishes\n(see inset in Fig. 1). The transport current displaces\nthe vortex from the local minimum of the pinning potential, so now the random elementary pinning forces do\nnot exactly compensate each others.\n\u221a The balance of the\ntotal maximum pinning force fp N from uncorrelated\npinning centers in a finite volume rp2 d and the Lorentz\nforce \u03c60 dJ/c yields the following equation for Jc :\n\u221a\n\u03c60 Jc d/c = fp N exp(\u2212u2 /rp2 ).\n\n(5)\n\nHere the exponential Debye-Waller factor accounts for\nthe smearing of the pinning force by thermal vortex fluctuations [5]. The mean-squared vortex displacement u2\nis given by the equipartition theorem:\n\u221a\n\u03b1L u2 = kT,\n\u03b1L = fp N /rp ,\n(6)\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, and \u03b1L is the Labush\nspring constant. Eqs. (5) and (6) yield\nJc =\n\nc\n\u03c60\n\nr\n\nkT \u0001\n\u03b3\nexp \u2212 \u221a\n,\nd\nrp \u03b3d\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b3(T, B) = Up2 ni , and Up = fp rp is the elementary\npinning energy. The function Jc (d) shown in Fig. 1 has\na maximum at d = dm due to the competition of pinning and\u221athermal fluctuations. Indeed, pinning increases\nJc \u221d 1/ d due to enhancement of relative fluctuations\nof the pinning potential \u223c N \u22121/2 as d decreases. At the\nsame time, the amplitude of thermal vortex vibrations\nu \u221d d\u22121/4 in the exponential factor also increases as d\ndecreases. Here dm and the maximum current density\nJm = Jc (dm ) are given by\ndm =\n\nk2 T 2\n,\n\u03b3rp2\n\nJm =\n\nc\u03b3rp\n,\ne\u03c60 kT\n\n(8)\n\nwhere e = 2.718. The optimum thickness dm (T ) increases at T increases, diverging at Tc . For instance, for\nrandomly distributed point pinning centers (say, oxygen\nvacancies [10, 11]), rp \u2243 \u03be(T ), and Up \u223c Bc2 (1 \u2212 b)2 \u03c3\u03be(0)\nand Up \u223c Bc2 (1 \u2212 b)2 \u03c3\u03be 2 /\u03be(0) for the s and d-wave pairing, respectively, where \u03c3 is the scattering cross-section\nof the pin [12]. Hence, \u03b3(T ) \u2243 \u03b30 [1 \u2212 (T /Tc )2 ]2 for the\nd-wave high-Tc superconductors. The value dm can also\nbe written in the form independent of particular pinning\nmechanisms:\np \u00032\n\u0002\ndm = ckT /Jc (d1 , T, B)\u03c60 rp d1 ,\n(9)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03b3 = d1 (Jc \u03c60 /c)2 is expressed in\nterms of the observed Jc at a sufficiently large thickness d1 > dm for which the 2D pinning still holds, but\nthe thermal exponential factor in Eq. (7) is close to 1.\nFor Jc = 1M A/cm2 at d1 = 1\u03bcm and T = 77K [2],\nrp = \u03be(77K) = 60\u00c5, Eq. (9) yields dm \u2243 0.8\u00c5. This\nsmall values of dm indicates that thermal fluctuations do\nnot affect Jc of YBCO coated conductors at 77 K and\nB well below the irreversibility field B \u2217 . However, the\nsituation changes for low-Tc weak pinning superconductors with Jc \u223c 103 \u2212 104 A/cm2 , and d \u223c 0.02 \u2212 1\u03bcm,\nsuch as N b3 Ge, M o3 Si [7] and M ox Ge1\u2212x [10] films.\nFor instance, for M ox Ge1\u2212x amorphous films with Jc =\n5 \u00d7 103 A/cm2 , Tc = 7.2 K, and d1 = 1200\u00c5, Eq. (9)\nyields dm = 780\u00c5 for rp = \u03be(T ) = 60\u00c5 and T = 4.2\nK. Because dm strongly depends on T and B, the appropriate tuning of T and B can bring dm into the range\nof d \u223c 102 \u2212 104 \u00c5 for which the nonmonotonic dependence of Jc (d) can be observed. Thus, low-Tc films can\nbe convenient model systems to probe the 2D-3D pinning crossover, and the interplay between vortex pinning\nand thermal fluctuations, which causes the nonmonotonic\nJc (d).\nNow I turn to YBCO coated conductors, focusing on\ntwo main issues. 1. Can Eq. (7) account for the observed dependence Jc (d) [1, 2]? 2. Can Eq. (7) help\nanswer the question whether the observed Jc (d) behavior is mostly determined by the thickness-dependent microstructure or the 2D pinning? Shown in Fig. 2 are the\nexperimental data on the critical current Ic = dJc (d)w\n\n\f3\nof YBCO coated conductors\u221aon flexible metal tapes [2]\nalong with the curve Ic \u221d d which follows from Eq.\n(7) for d \u226a dm . For d < 2\u03bcm, the 2D pinning theory\ndoes capture the behavior of Ic (d). However, at larger d,\nthe Ic (d) values are weakly dependent on d, exhibiting a\nshallow minimum at thicknesses 3 < d < 6\u03bcm which are\njust in the 2D-3D pinning crossover region.\nAlthough the 2D pinning model is in a reasonable\nagreement with the observed behavior of Jc (d) at small\nd, the relative contribution of the 2D pinning as compared to the essential microstructural factors (lesser epitaxy and higher porosity in thicker films) at low fields\nremains unclear. However, the 2D pinning contribution\ncan be probed more directly by measuring Jc (d) at higher\nB of the order of the irreversibility field B \u2217 . If such measurements reveal the nonmonotonic dependence Jc (d), it\nwould unambiguously indicate the key role of the 2D pinning. Indeed, any thickness-dependent microstructure\ncan hardly cause the maximum in Jc (d) in macroscopic\nfilms with d \u223c 1\u03bcm at high fields, while resulting in the\ndecreasing Jc (d) at lower fields. The nonmonotonic Jc (d)\ncan be observed if dm gets in the range 0.1 < d < 6\u03bcm\nwhere Jc (d) is usually measured. As follows from Eq.\n(9), this implies reducing Jc from the typical zero field\nvalues \u223c 1 \u2212 3M A/cm2 down to Jc \u223c 104 A/cm2 . Such\nJc reduction can be achieved by increasing B and/or T\n(around 5T at 77K [3]). Another easily tested feature of\nthe 2D pinning is that the crossover thickness (3), above\nwhich Jc becomes independent of d, increases as T and\nB are increased.\nThe above results may also be applied to thin filaments of radius dm \u226a R < Lc in a field B \u226b\n2\u03c0Jc R/c. For B < Bs , the critical current Ic of the\nround filament can be obtained by averaging Eq. (7),\nRR\nIc = 4 0 yJc (2y)dx, with the local \"thickness\" 2y =\np\n\u221a\n2 R2 \u2212 x2 , and exp(\u2212 dm /d) = 1. Hence,\n\u221a\nIc = 2.47c \u03b3R3/2 /\u03c60 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u221a\nwhere 2.47 = 2B(1/2, 5/4), and B(a, b) is the Euler\nbeta function. The 2D pinning gives rise to a weaker size\ndependence of Ic \u221d R3/2 for B < Bs and Ic \u221d R for\nB > Bs (see Eq. (1)) as compared to the 3D Ic \u221d R2 .\nIn summary, the 2D vortex pinning and self-field effects\nare suggested as possible mechanisms of the thickness de-\n\npendence of Jc in coated conductors. A nonmonotonic\ndependence of Jc (d) is obtained which accounts both the\n2D pinning and thermal fluctuations of vortices. An experimental test of the 2D pinning mechanism is proposed.\nThis work was supported by the AFOSR MURI\n(F49620-01-1-0464), NSF MRSEC (DMR 9214707), and\nDOE HEP (DE-FG02-91ER40643).\nFIG. 1: Thickness dependence of Jc (d) described by Eq.
