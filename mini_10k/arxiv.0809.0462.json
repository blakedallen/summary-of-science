Vilela Pereira, on behalf of the CMS Collaboration\nUniversit\u00e0 degli Studi di Torino & INFN Torino\nVia Pietro Giuria 1, 10125 Torino, Italy\n\u221a\nWe present a study of single-diffractive W -boson production in pp collisions at s =\n14 TeV, pp \u2192 Xp with X including a W boson, with the CMS detector. We discuss\nthe feasibility of observing this process with an integrated effective luminosity for single\ninteractions of 100 pb\u22121 .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the present paper, the single-diffractive (SD) reaction pp \u2192 Xp is studied, in which X\nincludes a W boson (Fig. 1). The W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay mode is considered. This reaction is\nsensitive to the diffractive structure function of the proton and to the rapidity gap survival\nprobability [2]. This process has been studied at the Tevatron, where the ratio of the yields\nfor SD and inclusive W production has been measured to be approximately 1% [3, 4].\nThe aim of this analysis is to demonstrate the feasibility of observing SD W\nproduction at CMS given an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of\nW\n100 pb\u22121 ; this effective luminosity will be\nlower than the integrated delivered luminosfq\nity and will depend on the machine conditions.\nlP\nLRG\nThe CMS apparatus is described in detail elsewhere [5]. Two experimental scenarios are considered here. In the first, no\nforward detectors beyond the CMS forward Figure 1: Sketch of the single-diffractive reaccalorimeter HF, which covers the region in tion pp \u2192 Xp in which X includes a W boson.\npseudo-rapidity of 3 < |\u03b7| < 5, are as- The symbol IP indicates the exchange with the\nsumed.

For the diffractive PDFs and the Pomeron flux, the result of the NLO H1 2006 fit\nB [7] was used. A rapidity gap survival probability of 0.05, as predicted in [8], is assumed.\nThe cross section, for the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd mode, is about 70 pb, leading to \u2243 7000 events per\n100 pb\u22121 . For non-diffractive W production, the pythia generator was used [9]. The cross\nsection, for the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd mode, is about 22 nb (NLO). With the given numbers for the cross\nsections, the ratio of diffractive to inclusive yields is 0.3%.\nDIS 2008\n\n\f3\n\nEvent Selection and Observation of SD W Production\n\n3.1\n\nW \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd selection\n\nThe selection of the events with a candidate W decaying to \u03bc\u03bd is the same as that used\nin [10]. Events with a candidate muon in the pseudo-rapidity range |\u03b7| > 2.0 and transverse\nmomentum pT < 25 GeV were rejected, as were events P\nwith at least two muons with\npT > 20 GeV. Muon isolation was imposed by requiring\npT < 3 GeV in a cone with\n\u2206R < 0.3. The transverse mass was required to be MT > 50 GeV. The contribution\nfrom top events containing muons was reduced by rejecting events with more than 3 jets\nwith ET > 40 GeV (selected with a cone algorithm with radius of 0.5) and events with\nacoplanarity (\u03b6 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6) between the muon and the direction associated to ETmiss greater\nthan 1 rad. Approximately 2,400 SD W events and 600,000 non-diffractive W events per\n100 pb\u22121 are expected to pass these cuts.\nDiffractive selection\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\n10-1\n\nCMS preliminary\n\n10-2\nHF\n\nCASTOR\n\nFigure 2 shows the generated energyweighted \u03b7 distribution for stable particles\n(excluding neutrinos) in diffractive and nondiffractive events, including the scattered\nproton; all events were generated with the\nscattered proton at positive rapidities (the\npeak at \u03b7 >\n\u223c10). Diffractive events have,\non average, lower multiplicity both in the\ncentral region and in the hemisphere that\ncontains the scattered proton, the so-called\n\"gap side\", than non-diffractive events.\nThe gap side was selected as that with\nlower energy sum in the HF. A cut was then\nplaced on the multiplicity of tracks with\npT > 900 MeV and |\u03b7| < 2. For the events\npassing this cut, multiplicity distributions\nin the HF and CASTOR calorimeters in the\ngap side were studied, from which a diffractive sample can be extracted.\n\nDensity\n\n3.2\n\n10-3\n\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\nPYTHIA Inclusive W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\n\n10-4\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u03b7 generated particles\n\nFigure 2: Generated energy-weighted \u03b7 distribution for stable particles in diffractive\n(pomwig, continuous line) and non-diffractive\n(pythia, dashed line) events.

The top left and top right plots show the distributions expected for the diffractive\nW events with generated gap in the positive and negative Z direction, respectively; they\nexhibit a clear peak at zero multiplicity. Conversely, the non-diffractive W events have on\naverage higher multiplicities, as shown in the bottom left plot. Finally, the bottom right plot\nshows the sum of the pomwig and pythia distributions \u2013 this is the type of distribution\nexpected from the data. The diffractive signal at low multiplicities is visible.\nDIS 2008\n\n\f3.3.2\n\nHF and CASTOR Multiplicity Distributions for the Gap Side\n\nThe HF tower multiplicity vs\nCASTOR \u03c6 sector multiplicity was\nstudied for the gap side. Since\nCASTOR will be installed at first\non the negative side of the interaction point, only events with\nthe gap on that side (as deterCMS preliminary\nn tracks \u2264 5\nmined with the procedure disPYTHIA Inclusive W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\nPOMWIG + PYTHIA\ncussed above) were considered.\nThe CMS software chain available for this study did not include\nsimulation/reconstruction code for\nCASTOR; therefore, the multiplicity of generated hadrons with\nFigure 3: Low-\u03b7 (\"central slice\") vs high-\u03b7 (\"forward energy above a 10 GeV threshold\nslice\") HF tower multiplicity distributions for events in each of the CASTOR azimuthal\nwith track multiplicity in the central tracker Ntrack \u2264 5. sectors was used.\nFigure 4 shows plots analogous\nto those of Fig. 3 for the combination of HF and CASTOR. The top plots show the pomwig\ndistributions; the few events in the top left plot are those for which the gap-side determination was incorrect. The signal to background ratio improves greatly with respect to the HF\nonly case.\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-minus side)\n\nN events (100 pb )\n\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10\n\n-1\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-plus side)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n7\n\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\nce\"\n\nw \u03b7 sli\n\nn HF \"lo\n\n8\n\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard 4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n10\n\n9\n\n\"\nw \u03b7 slice\n\nn HF \"lo\n\n600\n\nn H9 8\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0\n\n3.4\n\nnH\n\n1\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nn H9 8\nF\" 7 6\nforw 5\nard 4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0 0\n\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10 9\n\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10 9\n\nnH\n\n8\n\nF\"\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\"\nw \u03b7 slice\n\n6\n\n7\n\nw \u03b7 sli\n\nn HF \"lo\n\n7\n\nforw6 5\nard4 3\nslic 2 1\ne\" 0\n\n0\n\nce\"\n\nn HF \"lo\n\nObservation of SD W Production and Extraction of a Diffractive Sample\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n10 9\n\n2 1\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n10 9\n\nnC 8\nAS 7 6\nTO 5\nR 43\n2 1\n6\n0 0 2 4\n\nDIS 2008\n\n100\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n0\n10\n\nn C9 8 7\nAS 6\nTO 5\nR 4 3\n2\n10\n0\n\n18 20\n14 16\n8 10 12 n HF towers\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\nnC 8 7\nAS 6\nTO 5\nR 4 3\n\n120\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n18 20\n14 16\n8 10 12 n HF towers\n\nN events (100 pb-1)\n\n-1\n\nN events (100 pb )\n\nThe two-dimensional multiplicity\nPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-plus side)\nplots of Figs. 3 and 4 provide evPOMWIG SD W\u2192\u03bc\u03bd (gap in \u03b7-minus side)\nidence of SD W production.

The effect is to increase the number of events in\nthe low-multiplicity region by less than 1% of the SD yield. Non-diffractive W events,\nmisidentified as diffractive, have been discussed in the previous sections, where we showed\nthey can be kept under control.\nSD W production with proton-dissociation, pp \u2192 XN , where X contains a W boson\nand N is a low-mass state into which the proton has diffractively dissociated, is an irreducible background when N escapes undetected in the forward region. A study of protondissociation has been carried out in [11], where it has been shown that about 50% of the\nproton-dissociative background can be rejected by vetoing events with activity in the CMS\nZero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC), which provides coverage for neutral particles for |\u03b7| > 8.1.\nThe net effect is to enhance the diffractive signal in the zero multiplicity bin of Fig. 4 by\nabout 30%.\n\n4\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nA procedure has been discussed to arrive at the observation of single diffractive W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\nproduction with an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of 100 pb\u22121 . The\nprocedure is based on the detection of large rapidity gaps in the final state of the event using\nHF and CASTOR, complemented by the multiplicity information from the central tracker.\nAssuming a rapidity gap survival probability of 0.05, O(100) reconstructed signal events\nare expected with a high signal-to-background ratio if the CASTOR calorimeter is available.\nIf CASTOR is not available, the HF information alone may be sufficient. Further improvements are possible if the detectors of the TOTEM experiment [12] can be used, notably the\nT2 tracker and the roman pot detectors.\n\nReferences\n[1] CMS Collaboration, CMS PAS DIF-07-002 (2007).\n[2] J.
