BL\u00d6MKER, M. ROMITO, AND R. TRIBE\nA BSTRACT. The solutions to a large class of semi-linear parabolic PDEs\nare given in terms of expectations of suitable functionals of a tree of\nbranching particles. A sufficient, and in some cases necessary, condition is given for the integrability of the stochastic representation, using a\ncompanion scalar PDE.\nIn cases where the representation fails to be integrable a sequence of\npruned trees is constructed, producing a approximate stochastic representations that in some cases converge, globally in time, to the solution\nof the original PDE.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nThis paper considers stochastic representations for solutions to a large\nclass of semi-linear parabolic PDEs, or systems of PDEs, of the type\n(1.1)\n\n\u2202t u = Au + F (u) + f ,\n\nwhere A is an operator with a complete set of eigenfunctions, F is a polynomial nonlinearity in u and its derivatives, and f is a given driving function.\nIn short, the solution u is expanded into a Fourier series using the eigenfunctions of A. This yields (as in spectral Galerkin methods) a system of\ncountably many coupled ODEs for the Fourier coefficients. This ODE system is then solved in a weighted l\u221e -space, via an expectation over a tree\nof branching particles. The rules for the branching and dying probabilities arise from the particular PDE being studied. Moreover the PDE determines an evaluation operator Rt , acting on the tree Tk of particles rooted at\neach Fourier mode k, so that, under integrability assumptions, the (suitably\nweighted) k'th Fourier mode \u03c7k (t) is given by\n\u03c7k (t) = E [Rt (Tk )].\nThis is precisely the method of Le Jan and Sznitman [8] (later extended in\nBhattacharya et al. [3], Waymire [17], or Ossiander [13]) where they treated\nthe Navier-Stokes equations in R3 . Earlier papers connecting branching\nparticle systems to PDEs (for instance Skorokhod [15] or Ikeda, Nagasawa,\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 60J80; Secondary 35Q30, 35K55,\n35C99, 76M35, 60H30.\nKey words and phrases. Branching processes, pruned trees, stochastic representation,\nPDEs, semi-implicit approximation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. BL\u00d6MKER, M. ROMITO, AND R. TRIBE\n\nand Watanabe [7], and later McKean [11]) use branching coupled with a diffusion, and the stochastic representation is derived directly without Fourier\nseries, so that the linear operator A is limited to generators of diffusions.\nOur first aim is to show that this method applies to a large range of equations. In Section 2 we present three representative examples with quadratic\nnon-linearities. We comment on further generalisations in Section 2.5. Basically any system of parabolic PDEs with polynomial nonlinearities in the\nderivatives is admissible.\nOne major drawback of the stochastic representation is that it often fails\nto exist for large times t, although the solution to the PDE may still exist.\nThe problem is that Rt (Tk ) may fail to be an integrable random variable\nfor t \u2265 t0 . When deriving a system of ODEs in l\u221e space, there is considerable freedom in the choice of weights for the Fourier coefficient under\nwhich integrability can be established. See Bhattacharya et al. [3] for an\nextensive discussion in the case of 3D-Navier Stokes. One way to check integrability is to establish a scalar comparison equation. The finiteness of the\ncomparison equation implies the integrability needed for the stochastic representation to hold. The comparison equation is independent of the weights\nand represents a worst case scenario with super-linear (explosive) growth.\nIt typically completely ignores most of the structure of the non-linearity in\nthe original PDE.\nIn Section 3 we establish the stochastic representation under the assumption that it is integrable. In Section 4 we investigate the comparison equation. This typically shows the representation is integrable at small times,\nor, when there is no linear instability, for all times with small data. For\nsome classes of equations, for example 1d-Burgers equation, we obtain a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the integrability of the stochastic representation, independent of the choice of weights in Fourier space.\nOur second aim is to present an approach to treat cases where integrability fails. The key point is to get rid of the smallness condition on the initial\ndata and the forcing, in order to find a stochastic representation that is global\nin time. In Bhattacharya et al. [3] the branching trees are pruned after n generations. This gives a stochastic representation of a Picard iteration scheme\nconverging to the original PDE, but, as stated in [3], the existence of the\nexpectation is equivalent to the convergence of the Picard iteration scheme.\nIn another approach, Morandin [12] suggested a clever re-summation of the\nexpectation in order to improve the convergence for large times, but he was\nonly able to rigorously verify the global convergence of his method in a\nsimple example where (1.1) is a one-dimensional ODE. Our approach is to\nconstruct sets \u03a9n , with P[\u03a9n ] \u2191 1 so that\n\u03c7k (t) = lim E [Rt (Tk ) 1\u03a9n ] .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThis treats the expectation somewhat as a singular integral, where we have\nto be careful how to cut out the singularity.\n\n\fA BRANCHING PROCESS REPRESENTATION...\n\n3\n\nThe method we use, explained in Section 5, is to construct a pruned\n(n)\nbranching tree Tk which will agree with Tk on \u03a9n . The expectation for\nthe pruned tree\nE [Rt (Tk(n) )] = E [Rt (Tk ) 1\u03a9n ]\nis well defined and represents the kth Fourier mode of the solution to a\nsemi-implicit approximation scheme of the type\n\u2202t u(n) = Au(n) + F \u0303 (u(n) , u(n\u22121) ) + f .\nWe then use PDE techniques to verify that the approximation scheme converges to a solution of the original PDE. Although there are general results\nfor the convergence of such approximations (cf. for example Bj\u00f8rhus and\nStuart [4]) the assumptions are usually quite restrictive. Since stronger arguments are model specific, we present the arguments only in two special\ncases, namely for a simple quadratic ODE and for Burgers equation. We\nbelieve these examples illustrate that the method potentially dramatically\nextends the range of PDEs for which there is a global stochastic representation. A global result is essential if one wants to study a stochastic representation of the long time behaviour of solutions, for example in terms\nof stationary solutions or pull-back fixed points. Only in a very simple\nframework of small initial conditions and uniformly small forcing is it currently possible to derive such results (for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations\nsee Bakhtin [2] and Waymire [17]). The extension of such results to nontrivial cases and the relation with the pruned representation are the subject\nof work in progress.\n2. A BSTRACT\n\nSETTING AND EXAMPLES\n\nWe first present an infinite system of ODEs involving a quadratic nonlinearity. The system is indexed over k \u2208 Zd . We then discuss several\nexamples of PDEs on the torus [0, 2\u03c0)d and recast their Fourier transforms\ninto our abstract ODE setting. We do not present the highest generality\npossible, but focus instead only an equation with one quadratic nonlinearity,\none linear instability and one forcing term. We comment in Subsection\n2.5 on a large number of possible extensions, including other domains and\nboundary conditions, multiple forcing terms and additional nonlinearities,\npossibly of higher order.\n2.1. The general system of ODEs. We consider solutions \u03c7(t) : Zd \u2192 Cr\nto the following infinite dimensional system of Cr -valued ODEs\ni\nh\n(2.1) \u03c7\u0307k = \u03bbk \u2212 \u03c7k +C f pk \u03c7k +Cb \u2211 qk,l,mBk,l,m(\u03c7l , \u03c7m) + dk \u03b3k .\nl,m\u2208Zd\n\nwith k \u2208 Zd . The constants \u03bbk > 0 (which will determine the rate of particle\nevolution), pk , qk,l,m, dk \u2208 [0, 1] (which will determine the probabilities of\nflipping, branching and dying), and C f , Cb \u2265 0 (the flipping and branching\n\n\f4\n\nD. BL\u00d6MKER, M. ROMITO, AND R. TRIBE\n\nconstants) are fixed, as are bilinear operators Bk,l,m : Cr \u00d7 Cr \u2192 Cr satisfying\n|Bk,l,m(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 )| \u2264 |\u03c7| |\u03c7\u2032|\nfor all \u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 \u2208 Cr . The choice of these constants will arise from the Fourier\ntransform of the PDE being studied. We assume throughout that\n(2.2)\n\nfor all k \u2208 Zd ,\n\npk + qk + dk = 1\n\nand\n(2.3)\n\npk \u2192 0,\n\nqk \u2192 0,\n\nwhere\nqk =\n\n\u2211\n\nas |k| \u2192 \u221e\nqk,l,m.\n\nl,m\u2208Z d\n\nThe data for the equations consists of a time dependent forcing \u03b3 = {\u03b3k (t) :\nk \u2208 Zd , t \u2265 0} and an initial condition \u03c7(0) = {\u03c7k (0) : k \u2208 Zd }. We consider\nthe above system in its mild formulation, that is for given data we look for\nmeasurable t 7\u2192 \u03c7k (t) \u2208 Cr satisfying, for k \u2208 Zd ,\nZ t\nh\n\u2212\u03bbk t\n(2.4) \u03c7k (t) = e\n\u03c7k (0) + \u03bbk e\u2212\u03bbk (t\u2212s) C f pk \u03c7k (s)+\n0\ni\n+Cb \u2211 qk,l,mBk,l,m(\u03c7l (s), \u03c7m(s)) + dk \u03b3k (s) ds.\nl,m\u2208Zd\n\nNote that we need some regularity of \u03c7k , in order to make (2.4) well defined.\n\nRemark 2.1. There is considerable flexibility when choosing the constants\nin the ODE system (2.1). For example, we can adjust the probabilities pk ,\nqk,l,m, and dk by adjusting the constants Cb , C f and considering modified\nforcing data \u03b3. In particular, in an equation where the probabilities do not\nadd up to 1 in (2.2), it is always possible to adjust dk and the forcing data\nso that this constraint holds. Similarly, an equation with C f and Cb replaced\nby bounded functions of k can be recast into the form (2.1) by forcing the\nk dependence into the probabilities pk , qk , and dk .\n2.2. The d-dimensional Burgers equations. Consider solutions u(t, x) \u2208\nRd , for t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)d to the Burgers system\n(\n\u2202t u \u2212 \u2206u + (u * \u2207)u = f ,\n(2.5)\nu(0) = u0 ,\nwith periodic boundary conditions, where f is an external forcing. We restrict ourselves to periodic boundary conditions, as the nonlinearity is easy\nto compute in the Fourier basis. Nevertheless, other kinds of boundary conditions, for instance like Dirichlet or Neumann, can be treated in a similar\nfashion (cf. section 2.5).\nIf we expand the solution\nu(t, x) =\n\n\u2211\n\nk\u2208Zd\n\nuk (t)eik*x,\n\n\fA BRANCHING PROCESS REPRESENTATION...\n\n5\n\nthe equation reads in the Fourier coefficients as\nu\u0307k = \u2212|k|2 uk \u2212 i\n\n\u2211\n\n(ul * m)um + fk ,\n\nl+m=k\n\nThe sum is over all l, m \u2208 Zd satisfying l + m = k. Define a weight function\nwk = 1 \u2228 |k|\u03b1 , where \u03b1 > 0 will be chosen shortly, and set \u03c7k = wk uk . Then\n(2.6)\n\n(\nm\nk\n\u03c7\u0307k = \u2212|k|2 \u03c7k \u2212 i \u2211l+m=k |m|w\nwm wl (\u03c7l * |m| )\u03c7m + f k wk ,\n\u03c7k (0) = uk (0)wk .\n\nNote that the mode u0 has no linear dissipation. Below we will add and\nsubtract \u03bb0 \u03c70 to the equation for \u03c70 , which introduces a linear instability\nbut which allows us to write the equation in our desired abstract form. We\nnote that in dimension d = 1 this trick is unnecessary: the equations for the\nzeroth mode decouples, in that it simplifies to u\u03070 = f0 , and it is then possible\nto reduce the problem to the case f0 = u0 = 0.\nWe now show one way to recast (2.6) into the abstract form (2.1). For\ngiven C f , Cb , \u03bb0 > 0 we define\n(\n(\n0\nk 6= 0,\n|k|2 k 6= 0,\n\u03bbk =\npk =\n\u22121\nCf\nk = 0,\n\u03bb0\nk = 0,\nm \u2032\n|m|wk\n,\nBk,l,m(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032) = \u2212i(\u03c7 *\n)\u03c7 ,\n\u03bbk wl wm\n|m|\nwhenever l + m = k (and zero otherwise). Lemma 2.2 below ensures, provided we choose \u03b1 > max{ d+1\n2 , d \u2212 1}, that qk = \u2211l,m qk,l,m < \u221e and that\nqk \u2192 0 as |k| \u2192 \u221e.

The final example illustrates the change\nin weights needed for a higher order equation and the need to consider linear\ninstabilities.

Discussion of extensions and generalisations. We now list a number\nof possible extensions to the our basic system (2.1) for which modified tree\nrepresentations will hold.\n2.5.1.

If there\nis a complete countable set of L2 -eigenfunctions (ek )k\u2208N of A in which to\nexpand solutions as u = \u2211\u221e\nk=1 uk ek , one can recast PDEs in general domains\nwith various boundary conditions into a suitable ODE setting. This is similar to spectral Galerkin methods. Consider for instance\n\u2202t u = Au + B(u, u)\nfor a bilinear operator B, and suppose that Aek = \u03bbk ek .

This would cover our earlier examples, Burgers equation, Navier-Stokes or the surface growth equation, in a regular domain\nwith, for instance, Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. Note that\n(2.1) is now an R-valued system posed in l\u221e(R) which is indexed over N\ninstead of Z.\n2.5.2. Polynomial non-linearities. More general polynomial non linearities, or several non-linearities, lead to branching systems where particles\nsplit into a larger number of descendants. Even analytic non-linearities can\nbe handled, with the absolute values of the power series coefficients controlling the branching probabilities. Note also that a general first order term\nof the form \u2211l pk,l Bk,l (\u03c7k ), for linear Bk,l : Cr \u2192 Cr , can be thought of as a\nbranching event with a single offspring. This kind of term arises, for example, when the original PDE contains a multiplication operator u 7\u2192 f u for a\nfixed function f .\n2.5.3. Multiplicative forcing. A non-linear forcing term F(u, f ), again with\npolynomial F, can also be recast into a branching system of ODEs. This\nleads, say in the quadratic case, to time dependent bilinear operators Bk,l,m\nwhose values depend on the forcing \u03b3k (t), i.e. we obtain terms like a sum\nover qk,l,mBk,l,m(\u03b3l , \u03c7m ) in equation (2.1).\n\n\f8\n\nD.

The next theorem shows that there is a\nunique local solution to (2.1) taking values in the space l\u221e (Cr ) of bounded\nfamilies (akp\n)k\u2208Zd of elements of Cr , with the norm kak\u221e = supk\u2208Zd |ak |,\nwith |ak | = ak * a\u2217k the norm in Cr . We give a simple deterministic proof,\nbut there is also a more probabilistic proof available (see Corollary 4.3), in\nthe spirit of Le Jan and Sznitman [8].\nTheorem 3.1 (Unique local existence). Assume that\n\u03c7(0) \u2208 l\u221e (Cr ),\n\n\u03b3 \u2208 L\u221e ([0, T ], l\u221e(Cr )) for all T > 0.\n\nThen there exists a time T0 > 0, depending only on \u03c7(0), \u03b3, and the constants\nappearing in the equation, such that the mild formulation (2.4) has a unique\nr Zd\nsolution \u03c7 \u2208 L\u221e\nloc ([0, T0 ), (C ) ).\nMoreover, we have either T0 = \u221e or k\u03c7(t)k\u221e \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 T0 . Finally, if\nthe functions t 7\u2192 \u03b3k (t) are Ck , then t 7\u2192 \u03c7k (t) are Ck+1 in time and solve\nequation (2.1).\nProof. The proof is a rather standard application of the Banach fixed point\ntheorem. Let B be a ball of radius R > 0 centred at the constant function\nwith value \u03c7(0), in the space L\u221e ([0,t\u22c6], l\u221e (Cr )). For \u03c7 \u2208 B define F(\u03c7) by\nthe right-hand side of (2.4). Then for R0 = R + k\u03c7(0)k\u221e,\n\u0001\n|F(\u03c7)k(t)\u2212\u03c7k(0)| \u2264 k\u03c7(0)k\u221e +C f pk R0 +Cb qk R20 + k\u03b3(t)k\u221e (1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbkt\u2217 ).\n\nIf we choose R > k\u03c7(0)k\u221e + sup k\u03b3(t)k\u221e and t\u2217 small enough we see that F\nmaps B into itself. Here we have used assumption (2.3) to control the large\n|k|s. Moreover, if \u03c71 and \u03c72 are in B, then for t \u2264 t\u2217 ,\n\n|[F(\u03c71 ) \u2212F(\u03c72)]k (t)| \u2264 (C f pk +2Cb R0 qk )(1 \u2212e\u2212\u03bbkt\u2217) sup k\u03c71 (t) \u2212\u03c72(t)k\u221e.\nt\u2264t\u2217\n\nL\u221e ([0,t\n\n], l\u221e(Cr ))\n\nHence F is a strict contraction in\nif we choose t\u2217 small\n\u22c6\nenough. Here we need again, for large |k|, the assumption (2.3).\nThe assertion for the time T0 follows in a standard manner by gluing\ntogether local solutions. The continuity of t \u2192 \u03c7k (t) follows from the\nmild form (2.4). It is even differentiable with bounded derivative. The Ck regularity follows by differentiating (2.4) and the higher regularity follows\nfrom differentiating (2.1).\n\u0003\nA simple global existence result can be proved under the assumptions of\nlinear stability and small data.\nProposition 3.2 (Global existence for small data).

Informally, since the tree is finite when N[0,t] < \u221e the value of Rt (T )\ncan be calculated backwards along the tree, starting at time s = t and working back to time s = 0: evaluate the initial condition \u03c7(0) at any particles\nthat are alive at time t, evaluate the forcing function \u03b3(s) at any particle that\ndies at time s < t, and apply the bilinear operators at the times of branching\nevents.\nFor a careful proof one can define a sequence of approximations R(apprx)\nin\nn,t\nthe following way:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif t0/ \u2265 t,\n\uf8f2\u03c7k0/ (0)\n(apprx)\nR1,t (T ) = \u03b3k0/ (t \u2212 t0/ )\n/\nif t0/ < t, death at 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f31\notherwise,\nand R(apprx)\nn+1,t (T ) is given by\n(3.4)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\u03c7k0/ (0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03b3 (t \u2212 t )\nk0/\n0/\n(apprx)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4C f Rn,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c00 (T ))\n\uf8f4\n\u0001\n\uf8f3\n(apprx)\nCb Bk0/ ,k(1),k(2) R(apprx)\nn,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c01 (T )), Rn,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c02 (T ))\n\nt0/ \u2265 t,\nt0/ < t, death at 0/\nt0/ < t, flip at 0/\n/\nt0/ < t, branch at 0.\n\nIf N[0,t] < \u221e then only finitely many iterations are needed and Rt (T ) =\nR(apprx)\n\u0003\nn,t (T ) for all large n.\nIn some cases the evaluation can be written more explicitly.

TRIBE\n\nThe next theorem confirms this and shows that a finite solution to the\ncomparison equation (4.1) is a sufficient, and sometimes necessary, condition for the tree expectations E k [Rt ] to exist.\nTheorem 4.1. If the expectations in (4.2) are finite for all t \u2208 [0, T ] and\nk \u2208 Zd , then they define a mild solution to the comparison equation (4.1)\nfor which t \u2192 \u03c7\u0303k (t) is continuous on [0, T ].\nConversely if there exists a finite mild solution of (4.1), that is \u03c7\u0303k (t) < \u221e\nfor t \u2208 [0, T ] and k \u2208 Zd , then the expectations in (4.2) are finite for t \u2208\n[0, T ], and they define the smallest positive solution of (4.1).\nFinally, the comparison E k [|Rt |] \u2264 E k [R\u0303t ] holds, with equality whenever\n|Bk,l,m(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 )| = |\u03c7||\u03c7\u2032| for all k, l, m and \u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 .\nProof. For the first claim of the theorem, condition on the values of \u03c4D\n,\n0/ , K\n\u0002 (0)\u0003\nK(1) , K(2) and apply Lemma 3.3 to see that the expectations \u03c7\u0303k (t) = E k R\u0303t\nsatisfy the mild form of the comparison equation. Moreover the mild form\nof the equation shows that e\u03bbkt \u03c7\u0303k (t) is continuous and increasing in t. Note\nthat the convergence of the series in the mild formulation is not a problem\nhere, because due to positivity, we can use monotone convergence.\nFor the second part of the theorem, let \u03c7\u0303 be a mild solution of the comparison equation (4.1) in [0, T ] with data |\u03c7k (0)| and |\u03b3k |. Define a sequence\nof evaluations on the trees as follows: set R\u0303(expl)\n0,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) = \u03c7\u0303k0/ (t) and for each\nn \u2265 0,\n(4.3)\n\uf8f1\n|\u03c7k0/ (0)|\nt0/ \u2265 t,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2|\u03b3 (t \u2212 t )|\n/\nt0/ < t, death at 0,\nk0/\n0/\nR\u0303(expl)\n(expl)\nn+1,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) = \uf8f4\n/\nC f R\u0303n,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c00 (T ), \u03c7\u0303)\nt0/ < t, flip at 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(expl)\n(expl)\n/\nCb R\u0303n,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c01 (T ), \u03c7\u0303) R\u0303n,t\u2212t0/ (\u03c02 (T ), \u03c7\u0303) t0/ < t, branch at 0.\n\n(In the language of next section, the evaluation R\u0303(expl)\nn,t correspond to a pruning of the tree after n generations and the expectation E k R\u0303(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) will\nsolve a Picard iteration scheme for (4.1)).\nNote that, upon dying, flipping or branching, particles of length n are\nevaluated using the true solution \u03c7\u0303.

Note that in the above theorem, and its corollary below, we do\nnot insist the solutions are bounded in l\u221e .\nThe first two parts of the above theorem show that, when there exists a\nfinite mild solution \u03c7\u0303 to (4.1), the function defined by E k [R\u0303t ] is the smallest\n\n\fA BRANCHING PROCESS REPRESENTATION...\n\n15\n\nsolution to (4.1) lying below \u03c7\u0303. Note in the case of l\u221e solutions there is\nuniqueness of solutions, as in Theorem 3.1.\nAs in Le Jan and Sznitman [8], it is possible, when there exists a finite\nmild solution \u03c7\u0303 to (4.1), to show that n \u2192 R\u0303(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) is a non-negative martingale (with respect to a natural filtration along generations of the tree).\nUniform integrability of this martingale would then imply that \u03c7\u0303k (t) =\nE k [R\u0303t ].\nCorollary 4.3. Under the conditions of either the first or the second part of\ntheorem 4.1 the expectations \u03c7k (t) = E k [Rt ] are well defined for t \u2208 [0, T ]\nand k \u2208 Zd and form a mild solution to (2.1). Moreover, such a solution is\nunique among all mild solutions \u03c7\u2032 such that\n|\u03c7\u2032k (t)| \u2264 E k [R\u0303t ],\n\n(4.5)\n\nfor all k \u2208 Zd , t \u2208 [0, T ].\n\nProof. The expectations E k [Rt ] are well defined by theorem 4.1 as |Rt | \u2264\nR\u0303t . By conditioning on the first event as before they will solve the mild\nequation. Note that in this case the convergence of the sums in the mild\nequation is guaranteed by the finiteness of the comparison equation.\nLet \u03c7\u2032 be a mild solution verifying (4.5) and define a sequence of eval\u2032\nuations R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7 ) for n \u2208 N as in the proof of previous theorem, that is\n(expl)\nR0,t (T ) = \u03c7\u2032k0/ (t) and, for all n \u2265 1, R(expl)\nn,t (T ) is defined as in formula (4.3)\n\u2032\nwith data \u03c7 and \u03b3 and with products Bk,k(1),k(2) in the place of usual product.\nBy assumption (4.5) and an argument similar to (3.6) it follows that\n(expl)\n\u2032\n|R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7 )| \u2264 R\u0303n,t (T , \u03c7\u0303),\n\nwhere \u03c7\u0303k (t) = E k [R\u0303t ] and R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) are taken from the proof of Theorem 4.1. Moreover, as in that proof, we can show inductively that \u03c7\u2032k (t) =\n\u2032\nE k [R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7 )].\n(expl)\n\u2032\nWe next note that R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7 ) = Rt (T ) and R\u0303n,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) = R\u0303t (T ) on the\nset \u03a9n,t = {N[0,t] (T ) \u2264 n}. Thus,\n(expl)\nE k [R\u0303(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7\u0303)1\u03a9cn,t ] = \u03c7\u0303k (t) \u2212 E k [R\u0303n,t (T , \u03c7\u0303)1\u03a9n,t ]\n\n= E k [R\u0303t ] \u2212 E k [R\u0303t 1\u03a9n,t ] = E k [R\u0303t 1\u03a9cn,t ],\nand therefore\n(expl)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c7\u2032k (t) \u2212 E k[Rt ] \u2264 E k |R(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7 ) \u2212 Rt | = E k [|Rn,t (T , \u03c7 ) \u2212 Rt |1\u03a9cn,t ],\n\n\u2264 E k [(R\u0303(expl)\nn,t (T , \u03c7\u0303) + R\u0303t )1\u03a9cn,t ] = 2E k [R\u0303t 1\u03a9cn,t ].\nLetting n \u2192 \u221e we conclude that \u03c7\u2032 = \u03c7, the solution given by the probabilistic representation.\n\u0003\n4.2.

Note that this scalar comparison equation is independent of the choice of weights (called majorizing kernels in\nBhattacharya et al. [3]).\nFor the two-dimensional Navier Stokes equation discussed in section 2.3\nthe comparison equation for \u03be\u0303k = |k|\u2212\u03b1 \u03c7\u0303k takes the form\n\u03be\u0303 \u0307 k = \u2212|k|2 \u03be\u0303k +\n\n|k * l\u22a5|\n\u2211 |l|2 \u03be\u0303l\u03be\u0303m + | fk |,\nl+m=k\n\nwhich does not have a nice expression in the space variables.\nFor the surface equations discussed in section 2.4 the comparison equation becomes\n1\n\u2202t \u0169 = \u2212a1 \u22062 \u0169 \u2212 a2 \u2206\u0169 \u2212 \u2206|(\u2212\u2206) 2 \u0169|2 + f \u0303,\nwhere the forcing f \u0303 has Fourier coefficients | fk |.\nWhenever there is a solution to these scalar comparison equations with\nfinite Fourier coefficients we obtain the existence of mild solutions to the\ncorresponding abstract ODEs given by the stochastic representation (3.7)\nThis in turn is equivalent to the existence of solutions to the original PDEs\nwith finite Fourier coefficients.\nHowever all three scalar comparison equations have quadratic growth and\nit is possible to show, for example for zero forcing and large enough initial\ndata, that the solutions explode in finite time. See for example [10] and the\nreferences therein for the case of branching with diffusion.\nRemark 4.4. In the case of the 2d Navier Stokes, the 1d Burgers, or the\nsurface equation, the equality in the last part of Theorem 4.1 holds. This\nimplies that the stochastic representation E k [Rt ] is well defined as the expectation of an integrable variable, if and only if the corresponding comparison equation has a solution with finite Fourier coefficients. In particular,\nfor any suitable weight, the representation will fail to exist at the same time,\nonce a Fourier mode in the comparison equation becomes infinite for all\nsolutions.\n5. T HE\n\nPRUNED APPROXIMATION\n\n5.1. An ODE example of the approximation scheme. We first explain the\nmain ideas of the approximation scheme on a simple example, namely the\n\n\fA BRANCHING PROCESS REPRESENTATION...\n\n17\n\nequation u\u0307 = \u2212u + u2 . The solution can be given by the stochastic representation u(t) = E [u(0)Nt ], where Nt is the number of particles at time t of a\nsimple rate one branching process starting from a single particle at time 0.\nIt's easy to verify that the representation is well defined for all time t \u2265 0 if\nand only if |u(0)| \u2264 1, in that the variable |u(0)|Nt becomes non-integrable\nfor large t when |u(0)| > 1, while the solutions of the equation blow up only\nif u(0) > 1.\nWe now give a modification of the branching process. Give each particle\na label from the integers N. Particles still branch at rate 1 but a particle with\nlabel n produces two offspring, one with label n and one with label n \u2212 1.\nWhen a particle of type 0 tries to branch it simply dies. Start with a single\nparticle with label n and let Nt (n) denote the number of particles at time\nt. Set un (t) = E [u(0)Nt (n) ] for n \u2265 0 and u\u22121 \u2261 0. Then un (t) solves the\nfollowing semi-implicit iterative scheme\nu\u0307n = \u2212un + un\u22121 un ,\n\nun (0) = u(0),\n\nfor n \u2265 0.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that un (t) is well defined for all n and t. Moreover, un converges to the solution u(t) of the original problem for each initial\ncondition u(0) \u2264 1. This yields the stochastic representation\n\u0002\n\u0003\nu(t) = lim E u(0)Nt (n)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nvalid for all u(0) \u2264 1 and all t \u2265 0.\n\nRemark 5.1. The seemingly simpler modification (used by Le Jan and Sznitman [8] for their uniqueness proof and by Bhattacharya et al. [3]) where a\nparticle with label n produces two offspring each with label n \u2212 1, leads to\nthe explicit iterative scheme u\u0307n = \u2212un + u2n\u22121 . Unfortunately, the limit of\nun (t) for large t, as n \u2192 \u221e, fails to exist for u(0) < \u22121.\nThe semi-implicit approximation scheme works for other polynomial\nnon-linearities. For example, if one considers u\u0307 = \u2212u \u2212 u3 , the approximation scheme un = \u2212un \u2212 u2n\u22121 un , where each particle with label n branches\ninto three particles, one with label n and two with label n \u2212 1, is convergent\nto the true global solution for any initial condition.\n5.2. A general approximation scheme. The aim is to define a sequence\n(n)\nof approximations \u03c7k (t) to our abstract system of ODEs (2.1). These approximations will have a stochastic representation without any integrability\nproblems.\nRather than construct a particle system with labelled particles as described in the previous section, we put the modification into the evaluation operators.

The tree on the left can be pruned by starting,\ntop right, with a particle labelled (1), or, bottom right, by a\nparticle labelled (2). Circles mark the death via pruning. If a\nlabel larger than (2) is given to the starting particle, the tree\nis unpruned.\nThe implicit relation implies that if N[0,t] \u2264 m then Rn,t (T ) = Rt (T )\nwhenever n \u2265 m.

The local existence and uniqueness of solutions for the approximation scheme, follows from the same methods as in the proof of Theorem\n3.1, plus an inductive argument in n \u2265 0. The fact that solutions are globally defined follows, again by induction, from the simple estimate\n|\u03c7(n)\nk (t)| \u2264 k\u03c7(0)k\u221e + sup k\u03b3k\u221e +\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n\n+ \u03bbk\n\nZ t\n0\n\n\u0001\ne\u2212\u03bbk (t\u2212s) C f +Cb k\u03c7(n\u22121) k\u221e k\u03c7(n) k\u221e ds,\n\nwhich, using induction and Gronwall's lemma, easily gives boundedness of\nk\u03c7(n) k\u221e in each interval [0, T ].\nIn order to prove that the stochastic representation (5.3) is well defined,\nwe use a comparison argument, as in Section 4. The comparison equation\nfor the approximation scheme is given by\n\u0003\n\u0002 (n)\n(n) (n\u22121)\n(n)\n(n)\n\u03c7\u0303 \u0307 k = \u03bbk \u2212\u03c7\u0303k + pkC f \u03c7\u0303k +Cb \u2211 qk,l,m\u03c7\u0303l \u03c7\u0303m + dk |\u03b3k |\nl,m\u2208Zd\n\nand the evaluation E k |Rn,t | is finite as long as the \u03c7\u0303k are finite. But this\nfollows by the same arguments as in first part of this proof. Again E k |Rn,t | \u2264\n\u03c7\u0303k \u2264 C for all k \u2208 Zd and all t \u2208 [0, T ] with constant C depending only on\nT , \u03c7(0), and \u03b3.\nFinally, the expectations E k [Rn,t ] do form the unique solution to the approximation scheme by conditioning on the first branch of the tree as in\nTheorem 3.6.\n\u0003\n\nIn the integrable case, that is where E k |Rt | < \u221e, we have immediately\nfrom (5.2) that\nlim E k [Rn,t ] = E k [Rt ].\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIn particular, when the expectations E k [Rt ] are bounded over t \u2208 [0, T ] and\nk \u2208 Zd this implies the solutions of the approximation scheme converge\nto those of the original system (2.1). Our interest, however, is in the nonintegrable case and we aim to show that convergence of the approximation\nscheme directly and deduce that the limit limn\u2192\u221e E k [Rn,t ] exists and defines\na stochastic representation for all times t > 0.\n\n\f20\n\nD.

The aim of\nthis section is to give a few details of one example where the approximation scheme defined by the pruned representation converges, even when the\ndirect stochastic representation fails to be integrable. In contrast to the previous section, we use PDE methods. The convergence depends crucially on\nthe equation and how the pruning is done, as not all approximation schemes\nwill converge globally.\nFor simplicity we work with the one dimensional Burgers equation with\nforcing (2.5). In Subsection 2.2 we recast the equation into our abstract\nform by considering the weighted Fourier coefficients\n\u03c7k (t) = wk uk (t)\nwhere, as in section 2.2, the weights are given by wk = (1 \u2228 |k|\u03b1 ) for some\n\u03b1 > 1. If we assume the Fourier coefficients of the initial condition satisfy\nsup{|uk (0)| wk } < \u221e\n\n(5.5)\n\nk\n\nand the forcing function f satisfies\n(5.6)\n\nsup sup {| fk (t)| wk} < \u221e,\n\nfor all T > 0,\n\nk t\u2208[0,T ]\n\nthen proposition 5.2 implies there is a unique global solution \u03c7(n)\nk (t), given\nby (5.3), to the approximation equations (5.4).\nTheorem 5.3. Assume, in addition to (5.5) and (5.6), that u(0) \u2208 H 1 and\n\u221e\nf \u2208 L\u221e\nloc ([0, \u221e), L ). Consider the pruned approximation of the previous\nsection. Then the limit\n(5.7)\n\n\u03c7k (t) = lim \u03c7k (t) = lim E k [Rn,t ]\n(n)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nexists for all t \u2265 0 and all k \u2208 Z and defines a global solution of the Fouriertransformed Burgers equation.\nProof. Define\n\u22121 (n)\nu(n)\nk (t) = wk \u03c7k (t).\n\nSince \u03c7(n) is bounded we may reconstruct from these coefficients the function\n(n)\nu(n) (t) = \u2211 uk (t)eikx .\nk\u2208Z\n\nUsing the representation of Proposition 5.2, we see that, on the level of\nPDEs, u(n) solves the approximation scheme given by\n\uf8f1\n(0)\n2 (0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u2202t u = \u2202x u ,\n\u2202t u(n) = \u22022x u(n) + \u2202x u(n) u(n\u22121) + f ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3u(n) (0) = u(0).\n\n\fA BRANCHING PROCESS REPRESENTATION...\n\n21\n\nFix T > 0 and set C( f , T ) = supt\u2208[0,T ] k f (t)kL\u221e . We first use a maximum\nprinciple argument to show\n(5.8)\n\nsup ku(n) (t)kL\u221e \u2264 ku(0)kL\u221e +C( f , T ) T\n\nfor all n \u2208 N.\n\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n\nWe now derive an a priori estimate for the solution. The following calculation applies to sufficiently smooth functions and standard approximation\ntechniques imply that the resulting bound holds for the solutions above.\nUsing (5.8), we find\n1d\nk\u2202x u(n) k2L2 = \u2212k\u22022x u(n) k2L2 \u2212\n2 dt\n\u2212\n\nZ 2\u03c0\n0\n\nZ 2\u03c0\n0\n\n\u2202x u(n) u(n\u22121) \u22022x u(n) dx\n\n\u22022x u(n) f dx\n3/2\n\n\u2264 \u2212k\u22022x u(n) k2L2 +Ck\u22022x u(n) kL2 +Ck\u22022x u(n) kL2 ,\nwhere we have used the Poincar\u00e9 and Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities. Note\nthat the constant C > 0 depends only on T , C( f , T ), and u(0). Thus we find\nanother constant, also denoted C, such that for all n \u2208 N\nsup ku(n) (t)k2H 1 \u2264 C,\n\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n\nZ T\n0\n\nku(n) (t)k2H 2 dt \u2264 C\n\nand\nZ T\n0\n\nk\u2202t u(n) (t)k2L2 dt \u2264 C.\n\nWe now use standard methods to show that we have a solution of the limiting equation (cf. for example Temam [16]). Indeed by compactness results,\nthere is a subsequence (nk )k\u2208N , such that unk \u2192 u weakly in L2 ([0, T ], H 2 )\nand H 1 ([0, T ], L2 ), and strongly in L p ([0, T ], L2 ) for any p > 1. Thus u is the\nweak solution of Burgers equation, i.e. it solves the PDE in L2 ([0, T ], L2 ).\nAs weak solutions of the Burgers equation are unique, we can neglect the\nsubsequence, as any limiting point of u(n) defines the same solution u. Finally, the convergence is strong enough, in order to have all Fourier coefficients convergent. Thus for all k \u2208 Z the Fourier coefficients uk of u are\ngiven by\nuk (t) = lim uk (t) = lim w\u22121\nk \u03c7k (t).\n(n)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(n)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0003\nRemark 5.4. We point out that the assumptions of the previous theorem are\nby no means optimal. We have used a simplified method of proof, in order\nto provide an example in a simple context. In particular the constraint on\nthe initial condition can be relaxed. Furthermore, using regularisation properties of the PDE, we can always get sufficiently smooth initial conditions,\nif we wait a small amount of time.\n\n\f22\n\nD. BL\u00d6MKER, M. ROMITO, AND R.
