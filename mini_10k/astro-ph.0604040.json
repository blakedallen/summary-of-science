These sources \"reionize\" the intergalactic medium (IGM),\nenrich galaxies (and the IGM) with the first heavy elements, and\nseed larger galaxies.\nObservations now paint a fascinating \u2013 but confusing \u2013\npicture of their properties. Unfortunately, observing \"typical\"\ngalaxies at z >\n\u223c 8 is beyond the capabilities of existing instruments\n(though see Bouwens et al. 2004), so current constraints use\nreionization as an indirect proxy. The rapid evolution of the mean\nLy\u03b1 optical depth in quasar absorption spectra seems to indicate\nthat reionization is ending at z \u223c 6 (Fan et al. 2001, 2005).\nCorroborating evidence comes from the proximity zones around\nthese quasars, which also imply rapid evolution in the mean\nionized fraction x\u0304i (Wyithe & Loeb 2004; Mesinger & Haiman\n2004; Wyithe et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2005), as well as large-scale\nfluctuations in the transmission. But both are difficult to interpret:\nthe latter, for example, may also be characteristic of reionization\n(Wyithe & Loeb 2005; Fan et al. 2005), but so far the variations\nare also consistent with density fluctuations (Lidz et al. 2006).\nOn the other hand, large-scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by WMAP implies an early\nbeginning to reionization at z >\n\u223c 10, albeit with large uncertainties\n(Page et al. 2006; Spergel et al. 2006). How these puzzle pieces\nfit together \u2013 and, more fundamentally, how luminous sources\n\u22c6\n\nEmail:sfurlane@tapir.caltech.edu\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nevolve, how feedback processes (such as metal enrichment,\nphotoionization, or other radiation backgrounds) influence them,\nand how small-scale structure evolves in the IGM\u2013 remain mysterious (Wyithe & Loeb 2003a; Cen 2003b; Wyithe & Loeb 2003b;\nCen 2003a; Haiman & Holder 2003; Somerville & Livio 2003;\nFukugita & Kawasaki 2003; Onken & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2004;\nFurlanetto & Loeb 2005; Choudhury & Ferrara 2005; Iliev et al.\n2005). Unfortunately, identifying the relevant feedback processes\nand uncovering the source properties are impossible with existing\ndata.\nOne promising method to disentangle these degeneracies is\nthe 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen (see Furlanetto et al. 2006\nfor a review). Before reionization, the neutral IGM gas should\nbe visible against the CMB through this transition (Field 1958;\nSunyaev & Zeldovich 1972; Hogan & Rees 1979). In principle, we\ncan use it to map out the growth of the cosmic web and HII regions\nat z >\n\u223c 6 (Scott & Rees 1990; Madau et al. 1997; Zaldarriaga et al.\n2004). The key advantage of the 21 cm transition is that it is a line:\nhence every observed frequency corresponds to a different distance,\nand we can isolate each phase in the IGM's history.\nOf the many applications of the 21 cm line, the simplest (at\nleast conceptually) is to measure the global background as a function of frequency. This would allow us to measure x\u0304i (z) and, at earlier redshifts, the growth of soft-ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation backgrounds, which are difficult to constrain in any other way.\nThree quantities are relevant: the thermal history, the Ly\u03b1 background (both of which determine the spin temperature TS of the\nIGM), and the ionization history (which determines when the signal\nfades). Unfortunately, this global background is likely to be diffi-\n\n\f2\n\nS. R. Furlanetto\n\ncult to measure because of contamination by Galactic synchrotron\nradiation (see \u00a78). As a result, it has received little theoretical attention, and most existing work has simply argued that TS \u226b\nT\u03b3 (where T\u03b3 is the CMB temperature) during reionization (e.g.,\nMadau et al. 1997; Ciardi & Madau 2003; Chen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n2004). This is unfortunate because a number of efforts are nevertheless underway to observe it (and the challenges are not necessarily much greater than observing fluctuations in the background).\nIndirect techniques may also allow us to measure the background\n(Barkana & Loeb 2005b; Cooray 2005). And, of course, the global\nsignal sets the overall amplitude of fluctuations, so those should\nbe considered within this context. One exception is Sethi (2005),\nwho studied the evolution of the global background in a limited set\nof models that did not fully explore the many uncertainties in the\nproperties of the first sources.\nThe purpose of this work is to compute the high-redshift 21\ncm signal and to identify those properties that can be measured\nfrom the mean background. Because we know so little about the\nfirst sources, it is of course impossible to make robust predictions\nfor the background. We will instead parameterize the relevant processes and consider how they affect the mean signal. We first give\nsome background on the 21 cm transition in \u00a72. We then describe\nprocesses relevant to the thermal history of the IGM in \u00a73, to the\nspin temperature in \u00a74, and to the ionization history in \u00a75. We then\ndescribe some general consequences for the 21 cm history in \u00a76\nand examine some specific models in \u00a77. We conclude in \u00a78.\nIn our numerical calculations, we assume a cosmology with\n\u03a9m = 0.26, \u03a9\u039b = 0.74, \u03a9b = 0.044, H = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n(with h = 0.74), n = 0.95, and \u03c38 = 0.8, consistent with the\nmost recent measurements (Spergel et al. 2006), although we have\nincreased \u03c38 from the best-fit WMAP value in order to improve\nagreement with weak-lensing data.\n\nTS\u22121 =\n\n\u22121\nT\u03b3\u22121 + x\u0303\u03b1 T\u0303c\u22121 + xc TK\n.\n1 + x\u0303\u03b1 + xc\n\n(2)\n\nHere xc \u221d n is the collisional coupling coefficient for H\u2013H interactions (Zygelman 2005) and H\u2013e\u2212 collisions (Smith 1966; Liszt\n2001). The middle term describes the Wouthuysen-Field effect, in\nwhich absorption and re-emission of Ly\u03b1 photons mixes the hyperfine states. The coupling coefficient is (Chen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n2004; Hirata 2005)\nx\u0303\u03b1 = 1.81 \u00d7 1011 (1 + z)\u22121 S\u0303\u03b1 J\u03b1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere S\u0303\u03b1 is a factor of order unity describing the detailed\natomic physics of the scattering process and J\u03b1 is the background flux at the Ly\u03b1 frequency in units cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 ;\nthe Wouthuysen-Field effect becomes efficient when there is about\none photon per baryon near this frequency. It couples TS to an effective color temperature T\u0303c (in most circumstances, T\u0303c \u2248 TK ;\nField 1959). We use the numerical fits of Hirata (2005) for S\u0303\u03b1 and\nT\u0303c .\n\n3 THE THERMAL HISTORY\nTo compute the evolution of \u03b4Tb , we therefore need TK (z), J\u03b1 (z),\nand x\u0304i (z). In the next three sections, we will examine each in turn,\nbeginning with the kinetic temperature. The evolution equation is\ndTK\n2 X \u01ebi\n= \u22122H(z)TK +\n,\ndt\n3\nkB n\n\n(4)\n\ni\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side is the p dV work from\nthe expanding universe and \u01ebi is the energy input into the gas per\nsecond per unit (physical) volume through process i. We include a\nnumber of possible input mechanisms.\n3.1 Compton Heating\n\n2 THE 21 CM TRANSITION\nWe review the relevant characteristics of the 21 cm transition here;\nwe refer the interested reader to Furlanetto et al. (2006) for a more\ncomprehensive discussion. The 21 cm brightness temperature (relative to the CMB) of a patch of the IGM is\n\u03b4Tb\n\n=\n\n27 xHI (1 + \u03b4)\n\u00d7\n\n\u0010\n\nTS \u2212 T\u03b3\nTS\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0010\n2\n\n\u03a9b h\n0.023\n\nmK,\n\n0.15 1 + z\n\u03a9m h2 10\n\n\u00111/2\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the fractional overdensity, xHI = 1 \u2212 xi is the neutral fraction, and xi is the ionized fraction. Note that the patch\nwill appear in absorption if TS < T\u03b3 and emission otherwise.\nHere we have assumed that the patch expands uniformly with the\nHubble flow; radial peculiar velocities also affect \u03b4Tb by changing\nthe mapping from distance to frequency (Bharadwaj & Ali 2004;\nBarkana & Loeb 2005a). However, these anisotropic fluctuations\ndo not affect the mean signal, so we will ignore them. We will use\nx\u0304i to denote the globally averaged ionized fraction; the temperatures are likely to be much more uniform at most times, and we\nwill implicitly treat them as independent of position (though see\nBarkana & Loeb 2005b).\nThe spin temperature TS is determined by competition between three processes: scattering of CMB photons, collisions, and\nscattering of Ly\u03b1 photons (Wouthuysen 1952; Field 1958). In equilibrium (Hirata 2005),\n\nAt high redshifts, Compton scattering between CMB photons and\nthe residual free electrons in the IGM dominates. The heating rate\nis (e.g., Seager et al. 2000)\n2 \u01ebcomp\nx\u0304i\n8\u03c3T u\u03b3\n=\n(T\u03b3 \u2212 TK ),\n3 kB n\n1 + fHe + x\u0304i 3me c\n\n(5)\n\nwhere fHe is the helium fraction (by number), u\u03b3 \u221d T\u03b34 is the energy density of the CMB, and \u03c3T is the Thomson cross-section. The\nfirst factor occurs because CMB photons scatter off free electrons,\nbut the heat must be shared with all the particles. The efficiency of\nCompton heating decreases with cosmic time as electrons recombine and u\u03b3 falls; the IGM thermally decouples from the CMB at\n(Peebles 1993)\n1 + zdec \u2248 150(\u03a9b h2 /0.023)2/5 .\n\n(6)\n\nBelow this point, TK \u221d (1 + z)2 , as appropriate for a thermally\nisolated expanding gas.\n3.2 X-ray Heating\nThe thermal evolution becomes much more complex (and uncertain) once the first luminous sources appear. X-rays from galaxies and quasars likely provide most of the heat for the low-density\nIGM. Given our large uncertainties about the nature of highredshift objects, we will take a simple parameterized approach calibrated to nearby starburst galaxies. These objects show a clear\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe Global 21 cm Background\ncorrelation between star formation rate (as measured by the total infrared luminosity) and hard X-ray (2\u201310 keV) luminosity\n(Grimm et al. 2003; Ranalli et al. 2003; Gilfanov et al. 2004):\nLX = 3.4 \u00d7 1040 fX\n\n\u0012\n\nSFR\n1 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nerg s\u22121 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere fX is a correction factor accounting for the (unknown) differences at high redshifts. Note that we have transformed to the\ntotal (> 0.2 keV) X-ray luminosity assuming a spectral index\n\u03b1 = 1.5 (where L\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ) in this range (Rephaeli et al. 1995).\nThis is only an average index, of course, but errors can be subsumed\ninto the unknown normalization fX .\nThere is of course no rigorous justification for extrapolating\nthis relationship to high redshifts, but it is certainly reasonable.\nMassive X-ray binaries produce the bulk of high-energy emission in nearby starbursts. Such systems form when the first massive stars die, only a few million years after star formation commences. So they should also be present in high-redshift galaxies\n(Glover & Brand 2003). Of course, their abundance must change\nwith the metallicity and initial mass function (IMF): if, for example, the IMF is top-heavy, fX could be significantly larger than\nunity. But for the moment we can only speculate about the magnitude of such evolutionary effects.\nA second source is inverse-Compton scattering from relativistic electrons accelerated in the supernova remnants. In the nearby\nuniverse, only powerful starbursts have strong enough radiation\nfields for this to be competitive with synchrotron cooling; however,\nthe CMB has u\u03b3 \u221d (1 + z)4 , so inverse-Compton emission may\ndominate over synchrotron emission in all star-forming environments at high redshift (Oh 2001). We can make a simple estimate\nof the extra luminosity contributed by these fast electrons. Suppose\nthat a fraction \u01ebe of the total supernova energy ESN is used to accelerate electrons, and that a fraction fe \u223c 0.5 of this energy is\nemitted in X-ray photons (this fraction is determined by cooling\nwithin the shock; Furlanetto & Loeb 2004). We also let \u03bdSN be the\nnumber of supernovae per unit mass of star formation. Then\nLSN\nX\n\n=\n\n1.6 \u00d7 1040 fe\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nSFR\n1 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n\n\u01ebe\nESN\n\u03bdSN\n0.05 0.01 M\u2299 \u22121 1051 erg\n\n\u0013\n\nerg s\u22121 ,\n\n\u0013\n(8)\n\nwhere we have substituted \u01ebe \u223c 0.05 as appears to be appropriate\nfor nearby supernova remnants (e.g., Koyama et al. 1995). Thus, if\na large fraction of the electron energy is emitted in X-ray photons,\ninverse-Compton emission from fast electrons can contribute a nonnegligible \u2013 though not necessarily dominant \u2013 fraction of the total\nemission. Conveniently, fX \u223c 1 still seems reasonable.\n1\nExtremely massive ( >\n\u223c 300 M\u2299 ) Pop III stars could have a\nwildly different normalization, of course: each pair-instability supernova releases \u223c 1052 \u20131053 erg, much more than normal supernovae (Heger & Woosley 2002). The fraction of X-ray binaries may also be significantly larger, or the remnants may form\n\"miniquasars.\" Moreover, these stars also produce soft X-rays directly, because they have surface temperatures Teff \u223c 105 K\n(Bromm et al. 2001; Schaerer 2002). To a first approximation, the\n1\n\nNote that we will use \"Pop III\" to refer exclusively to this very massive\ncase. If Pop III stars have more or less normal initial mass functions, they\nproduce histories close to our Pop II case. We use the massive stars only for\ncontrast with the \"standard\" histories and do not mean to pass judgment on\nthe relative merits of the different initial mass functions.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nstellar spectra are simple blackbodies, in which case \u223c 0.3% of the\ntotal stellar luminosity is emitted in photons with E > 0.1 keV.\nThis would imply fX \u226b 1. However, photons near \u223c 0.1 keV are\nabsorbed relatively quickly, and they affect only the region within\n< 0.5 Mpc of galaxies (Sethi 2005; Cen 2006). Thus it is the harder\n\u223c\nphotons with which we are primarily concerned, and these come\nfrom nonthermal sources: at Teff = 105 K, only \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 of the\nPop III stellar luminosity lies in photons with E > 0.2 keV.\nBecause X-ray heating is thus intrinsically non-uniform, we\nmust develop some approximation for our global treatment \u2013 in\nthe simplest terms, we must specify the photon energy range that\nwe assume can penetrate into the diffuse IGM. Equation (7) included all photons with E > 0.2 keV. In actuality, all photons with\n1/3\nE < Ethick = 1.5 x\u0304HI [(1 + z)/10]1/2 keV are absorbed within a\nHubble length (Oh 2001), so photons near the bottom edge of our\nrange will be absorbed over a relatively small \u2013 but by no means\nnegligible \u2013 volume. By including soft photons, we are attempting\nto balance the highly-penetrating hard X-rays with the more localized soft X-rays that likely carry more total energy. Of course, this\nfluctuating component (e.g., Madau et al. 2004) will lead to nonuniform heating (Sethi 2005). We defer discussion of these fluctuations to future work; our concern here is with understanding the\nzeroth-order global evolution. Fortunately, uncertainty in the overall effect of inhomogeneity can be subsumed into our much larger\nuncertainty in fX so long as the spectrum is a reasonably shallow\npower law (as appropriate for nonthermal sources). For example,\nGlover & Brand (2003) used a method much like our own but took\nfX \u223c 0.2 because they calibrated to the luminosity in the 2\u201310\nkeV band, which implicitly assumes that soft photons are absorbed\ninside or near their source galaxies.\nX-rays deposit energy in the IGM by photoionizing hydrogen and helium; the hot \"primary\" electron then distributes its energy through three channels: (1) collisional ionization, producing\nmore secondary electrons, (2) collisional excitation of He, which\nproduces a photon capable of ionizing H, and (3) Coulomb collisions with thermal electrons. The relative cross-sections of these\nprocesses determine the fraction of X-ray energy going to heating\n(fX,h ) and ionization (fX,ion ); clearly they depend on both x\u0304i and\nthe initial photon energy. For our calculations, we will use the high\nenergy limit (E \u226b 0.1 keV) of Shull & van Steenberg (1985), who\nfit their results to\nfX,h\n\n=\n\nfX,ion\n\n=\n\nC1 [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 xai 1 )b1 ]\nC2 (1 \u2212 xai 2 )b2 .\n\n(9)\n\nHere C1 = 0.9971, a1 = 0.2663, b1 = 1.3163, C2 = 0.3908,\na2 = 0.4092, and b2 = 1.7592; the fits are accurate to <\n\u223c 2%\nin the range of interest. Although not as good for softer photons,\nthe qualitative behavior is similar: when x\u0304i is small, most of the\nenergy is deposited in ionizations (fX,h \u2248 0.2 for E = 3 keV and\nx\u0304i = 10\u22123 ), but fX,h \u2192 1 as x\u0304i \u2192 1, because collisions with free\nelectrons become more important.2\nWe are now in a position to estimate the heating rate from\nX-rays in the early universe. We first assume that the star formation rate is proportional to the rate at which matter collapses\ninto galaxies, which we assume correspond to dark matter halos\n\n2 Note that here x refers to the ionized fraction in the predominantly\ni\nneutral gas (outside of HII regions) whose temperature we care about. In\nthe models below, we track this separately from the usual ionized fraction,\nwhich instead describes the filling factor of HII regions, by assuming that\nonly X-rays ionize this mostly neutral gas.\n\n\f4\n\nS. R. Furlanetto\n\nwith m > mmin , where mmin is a (redshift-dependent) minimum mass. We will typically take mmin = m4 , where m4 has a\nvirial temperature Tvir = 104 K (the threshold for atomic cooling;\nBarkana & Loeb 2001). We define fcoll to be the fraction of matter in collapsed halos with m > mmin ; for the Press & Schechter\n(1974) mass function, it takes the simple analytic form\n\n\u0014\n\nfcoll = erfc \u221a\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03b4c (z)\n,\n2\u03c3(mmin )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b4c is the linear overdensity at virialization and \u03c3 2 (m) is the\nvariance of the density field when smoothed on scale m. By equation (7), the X-ray emissivity is proportional to the star formation\nrate and hence to dfcoll /dt; the result is\n\u01ebX\n2\n= 103 K fX\n3 kB nH(z)\n\n\u0012\n\nf\u22c6 fX,h dfcoll /dz 1 + z\n0.1 0.2\n0.01\n10\n\n\u0013\n\n, (11)\n\nwhere f\u22c6 is the star formation efficiency. We immediately see that\nX-ray heating should be quite rapid, provided that fX >\n\u223c 0.1.\nOf course, our assumption that \u01ebX \u221d dfcoll /dt may be wrong\nbecause (for example) some exotic process produces X-rays, or because quasars are common, or simply because f\u22c6 is not a constant.\nHowever, unless the process of interest is uncorrelated with galaxy\nformation, it will not differ dramatically from that we have discussed. On the other hand, quasars could strongly increase the normalization of fX . We have chosen to ignore this possibility because\nextrapolating the known population of bright quasars to higher redshifts yields an X-ray background with negligible effects on the\nIGM (Venkatesan et al. 2001). A number of models posit an entirely new population of \"miniquasars\" (e.g., Madau et al. 2004;\nRicotti et al. 2005), but we will conservatively ignore them. We\nbriefly discuss how such miniquasars could affect our conclusions\nin \u00a78.\n3.3 Ly\u03b1 Heating\nAs photons redshift into the Lyman-series resonances, they scatter\noff of neutral hydrogen atoms in the IGM and deposit energy in\nthe gas through atomic recoil. While initially thought to be an important heat source (Madau et al. 1997), Chen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n(2004) and Rybicki (2006) showed that the energy deposition rate\nin repeated Ly\u03b1 scatterings is actually extremely small because\nthe photons quickly establish equilibrium with the gas (see also\nFurlanetto et al. 2006 for a discussion of the approach to equilibrium). The heating rate from higher Lyman resonances is also\nsmall because those photons are quickly transformed into either\nLy\u03b1 photons or continuum photons that easily escape to infinity\n(Pritchard & Furlanetto 2005). We therefore neglect this mechanism.\n\n3.4 Shock Heating\nFinally, we must consider heating from shocks in the IGM. At low\nredshifts, shocks play an integral role in its temperature structure\n(Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). The shock networks surrounding filaments and halos can be quite complex (Miniati et al.\n2000; Kang et al. 2005), but their characteristic properties are easy\nto estimate. The typical shock that has just collapsed at redshift z\nwill have a peculiar velocity equal to the total distance it has collapsed divided by the age of the Universe, vsh \u2248 H(z)Rnl (z),\nwhere Rnl is the (physical) nonlinear length scale (Cen & Ostriker\n\n1999). For a strong shock in a monatomic gas, the corresponding\npostshock temperature is\nTsh =\n\n3\u03bcmp 2\n3\u03bcmp 2\n2\nvsh \u2248\nH (z) Rnl\n(z),\n16kB\n16kB\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mean molecular weight in atomic units. This yields\nTsh \u223c 107 K at the present day (Cen & Ostriker 1999), comparable to the results of numerical simulations. On the other hand\nTsh \u223c 104 K at z \u223c 3, close to the mean temperature of a\nphotoionized medium (Furlanetto & Loeb 2004). Thus large-scale\nstructure shocks decrease in importance at moderate redshifts.\nHowever, before reionization they are also important, because without photoheating TK can be small and the IGM sound\nspeed may be much less than vsh . Unfortunately, studying this\nregime requires extremely high resolution numerical simulations,\nand the current generation appears to disagree on their significance.\nGnedin & Shaver (2004) found IGM shocks to be the most important factor in determining \u03b4Tb at z <\n\u223c 15, but other simulations suggest that filament shocks have a relatively modest effect (comparable to the signal from minihalos; Kuhlen et al. 2006; Shapiro et al.\n2005). One possible reason for the discrepancy is that the latter two\nstudies assumed that only overdense gas could be observed against\nthe CMB and so only included shocks bounding the cosmic web.\nGnedin & Shaver (2004), on the other hand, assumed that the entire IGM was visible because of Ly\u03b1 coupling. Thus it is possible\nthat the tiny sound speed in the IGM allows a population of weak\nshocks to exist outside the cosmic web. Unfortunately, weak shocks\nin the low density IGM may be difficult to resolve properly in simulations. Another alternative is that the differences occurred because\nthe studies focused on different redshift regimes.\nFor now, we will assume the latter and use the simple model\nof Furlanetto & Loeb (2004) to estimate the effect of shocks in\nthe cosmic web (see also Nath & Silk 2001; Valageas et al. 2002).\nThis prescription assumes that shocks form around a region once\nits mean linearized density exceeds \u03b4sh = 1.06. This is equivalent to assuming that they appear when spherical perturbations\n\"turnaround\" and break off from the Hubble flow (i.e., when the\nflow begins to converge). This spherical picture is approximate, but\nit provides a simple criterion to estimate the fraction of mass that\nhas been shocked on its way to halo formation. Conveniently, at\nturnaround, the physical velocity is of course zero, so the peculiar\nvelocity is almost precisely vsh \u2248 H(z)Rnl (z). Thus it reproduces\nthe characteristic temperature of z = 0 shocks. In the same way as\nthe Press & Schechter (1974) mass function, it also yields the distribution of shock temperatures at any epoch.\nThus, by analogy to equation (10), the fraction of gas that has\nbeen shocked to a temperature T > Tsh is\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03b4sh (z)\nfsh (> Tsh ) = erfc \u221a\n,\n2\u03c3(Tsh )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Tsh is related to the mass of the underlying perturbation via\nequation (12). For example, the mass corresponding to a shock\nwith Tsh = T\u03b3 is M\u03b3 \u2248 4.3 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , which is somewhat greater than the minimum collapse mass (the so-called \"filter\nmass;\" Gnedin & Hui 1998) \u2013 though note that \u03b4sh < \u03b4c so more\ngas will be in the shocked phase than in collapsed objects of a comparable mass. For our model, we will simply compute the fraction\nfsh of gas that has been heated to TK > T\u03b3 . We will assume that\nthis gas emits strongly relative to the CMB (TS \u226b T\u03b3 ), while the\nrest remains at the mean temperature (without shocks). Note that,\nonce X-rays have heated the IGM above T\u03b3 , shock heating will\nbecome less significant than our prescription assumes; however, in\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe Global 21 cm Background\nthat regime the shocked gas and background IGM emit at nearly\nthe same level and so shocks have almost no observable effect.\nWe emphasize that this treatment is meant to include only\nshocks that are part of structure formation (sheets, filaments, and\nhalos). As described above, there may be a population of weaker\nshocks in the low-density IGM that deposit a significant amount of\nthermal energy there. In the language of our model, these would\ncorrespond to shocks that appear before turnaround due to random\nIGM flows. Our model may thus underestimate TK at early times\nand overestimate the amplitude and duration of absorption. But, as\nwe will see, X-ray heating generally becomes significant at z >\n\u223c 15,\nwhen such perturbations would presumably be significantly smaller\nthan those of Gnedin & Shaver (2004).\n\n4 THE SPIN TEMPERATURE\nOnce TK is known, the next step is to compute the spin temperature of the gas. We include H-H collisions (Zygelman 2005), H-e\u2212\ncollisions (Smith 1966; Liszt 2001), and the Wouthuysen-Field effect (Wouthuysen 1952; Field 1958; Hirata 2005) as described in\n\u00a72. Collisions are unimportant for the low-density IGM during the\nepochs of interest,3 , so the Wouthuysen-Field mechanism is therefore the most important factor. Its strength depends on the soft-UV\nradiation background, for which we will construct a simple, easily\nparameterized model. We again assume that young stars dominate\nthe flux, so that we can write the comoving emissivity at frequency\n\u03bd is\n\u01eb(\u03bd, z) = f\u22c6 n\u03040b \u01ebb (\u03bd)\n\ndfcoll\n.\ndt\n\n(14)\n\nThe function \u01ebb (\u03bd) is the number of photons produced in the frequency interval \u03bd \u00b1 d\u03bd/2 per baryon incorporated into stars. For\nspin temperature coupling, we are interested only in photons between Ly\u03b1 and the Lyman-limit.4 We use the spectral models of\nBarkana & Loeb (2005b), which fit a power law between each\nLyman-series resonance. For Population III stars, a total of N\u03b1 =\n4800 photons are produced per baryon in the interval (\u03bd\u03b1 , \u03bdLL ),\nwith a relatively flat spectral distribution (Bromm et al. 2001). For\ncontinuously forming low-metallicity Population II stars, N\u03b1 =\n9690 photons are produced per baryon, with the spectrum falling\nsteeply past the Ly\u03b2 resonance (Leitherer et al. 1999).\nThe average Ly\u03b1 background is then\nnmax\n\nJ\u03b1 (z)\n\n=\n\nX\n\nJ\u03b1(n) (z)\n\nn=2\nnmax\n\n=\n\nX\nn=2\n\nfrec (n)\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nzn\n\ndz \u2032\nz\n\n(1 + z)2 c\n\u01eb(\u03bdn\u2032 , z \u2032 ),(15)\n4\u03c0\nH(z \u2032 )\n\nUnless, that is, X-ray heating is extremely strong and renders x\u0304i >\n\u223c 0.03\n(Nusser 2005).\n4 Here we ignore Lyman-line photons produced inside galaxies as well as\nline photons produced following IGM ionizations. The former is a reasonable assumptions because these photons rapidly redshift out of resonance\nand hence only affect a small fraction of the IGM (much of which is predominantly ionized). The second is an excellent approximation for Pop II\nstars but less good for Pop III stars, because of their hard spectra. Nevertheless, such photons also rapidly redshift out of resonance near the edge of\nthe HII regions.\n\n3\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\n(n)\n\nwhere J\u03b1 is the background from photons that originally redshift\ninto the Lyn resonance, \u03bdn\u2032 is the frequency at redshift z \u2032 that redshifts into that resonance at redshift z,\n(1 + z \u2032 )\n,\n(1 + z)\n\n(16)\n\n1 + zn\u2032\n1 \u2212 (n + 1)\u22122\n=\n1+z\n1 \u2212 n\u22122\n\n(17)\n\n\u03bdn\u2032 = \u03bdn\nand\n\nis the largest redshift from which a photon can redshift into it. The\nfactor frec (n) is the fraction of the resulting Lyn photons that actually cascade through Ly\u03b1 and induce strong coupling (Hirata 2005;\nPritchard & Furlanetto 2005). We truncate the sum at nmax = 23\n(following Barkana & Loeb 2005b), although the closely-spaced\nn \u226b 1 levels contribute only a small fraction of the total flux.\nFinally, we compute the coupling coefficient x\u0303\u03b1 from equation (3).\nFor estimation purposes, we can approximate equation (15) as\nc  \u0304\nN\u03b1\nfrec f\u22c6 n\u03040b \u2206fcoll\n(1 + z)2 .\n(18)\n4\u03c0\n\u2206\u03bd\nHere f \u0304rec is the average probability that a photon in the interval\n(\u03bd\u03b1 , \u03bdLL ) is converted into a Ly\u03b1 photon. It is f \u0304rec = 0.63 and\n0.72 for our Pop III and Pop II spectra (Pritchard & Furlanetto\n2005). We have approximated the spectrum as constant (so that\n\u01ebb \u223c N\u03b1 /\u2206\u03bd, where \u2206\u03bd = \u03bdLL \u2212 \u03bd\u03b1 ) and let \u2206fcoll \u223c fcoll be\nthe spectrum-weighted collapse fraction over the appropriate redshift intervals in equation (15).\nJ\u03b1 \u2248\n\n5 THE IONIZATION HISTORY\nThe next step in understanding the global history of the 21 cm signal is x\u0304i (z). This has been a subject of extensive study over the\npast three decades (see, e.g., Barkana & Loeb 2001; Haiman 2004;\nCiardi & Ferrara 2005 for recent reviews). As such, we will not attempt to explore all of its aspects. We will again examine a simple\nmodel encapsulating the major features in the global evolution.\nWe associate reionization with the star formation rate in a similar way to the Ly\u03b1 and X-ray backgrounds (see eqs. [11] and [14]).\nWe write\ndx\u0304i\ndfcoll\n= \u03b6(z)\n\u2212 \u03b1A C(z, xi )x\u0304i (z)n\u0304e (z),\n(19)\ndt\ndt\nwhere \u03b6 is an ionizing efficiency parameter, \u03b1A = 4.2 \u00d7\n10\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 is the recombination coefficient at T = 104 K,5\nC \u2261 n2e / hne i2 is the clumping factor, n\u0304e is the average electron density in ionized regions, and \u03b6 is an ionizing efficiency parameter. The first term on the right hand side is the source term for\nionizing photons and the second term is a sink describing recombinations.\nWe must now specify \u03b6, mmin (for fcoll ), and C. The ionizing\nefficiency can be written\n\u03b6 = AHe f\u22c6 fesc Nion ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere fesc is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host\ngalaxy into the IGM, Nion is the number of ionizing photons per\nbaryon produced in stars, and AHe is a correction factor for helium. With the exception of AHe , all of these parameters are highly\n5 Note that we use the case-A value, which essentially amounts to assuming that ionizing photons are absorbed inside dense, neutral systems\n(Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 2000).\n\n\f6\n\nS. R. Furlanetto\n\nuncertain. The star formation efficiency depends on the dynamics\nof star formation in young galaxies, fesc depends on the distribution of gas, dust, and stars within galaxies, and Nion depends on\nthe stellar IMF and metallicity. We will therefore content ourselves\nwith representative values of these parameters in our calculations\n(see the discussion in Furlanetto et al. 2006 for more information).\nOf course, both \u03b6 and mmin could evolve with time because of feedback. For example, metal enrichment could decrease\n\u03b6 if Pop II stars are less efficient than their Pop III progenitors,\nor mmin could increase because of photoheating during reionization (Rees 1986; Efstathiou 1992; Thoul & Weinberg 1996;\nKitayama & Ikeuchi 2000; but see Dijkstra et al. 2004). Feedback\nis one promising method to slow reionization and reconcile the\nSDSS quasar data with WMAP, but the mechanisms at play and\ntheir interactions are essentially unconstrained. For our purposes,\nthe important question is how they affect the global reionization\nhistory. Early efforts suggested that they might introduce sharp features such as \"double reionization\" (Cen 2003b; Wyithe & Loeb\n2003a). However, this requires a sharp drop in the ionizing efficiency that is synchronized across the entire Universe. That is difficult to arrange when the inhomogeneities inherent to local feedback mechanisms are included (Furlanetto & Loeb 2005). Instead,\nfeedback is likely to prolong reionization or introduce a \"stalling\"\nphase. We will show some examples generated using the feedback\nmodels of Furlanetto & Loeb (2005) to illustrate its effects.\nThe clumping factor can, in principle, be computed through\nnumerical simulations with radiative transfer. Unfortunately, that\nrequires fully resolving small-scale structure in the IGM as well\nas its evolution throughout reionization. Moreover, C depends on\nhow the IGM is ionized \u2013 for instance, whether low-density gas is\nionized first or whether many photons are consumed ionizing dense\nblobs when x\u0304i is still small (Furlanetto & Oh 2005). Thus C must\nbe recalculated for each different set of model parameters. Unfortunately, simulations have not yet achieved these goals. Following\nour usual policy, we will therefore use a simple analytic model\n(Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 2000); in this prescription, voids are ionized\nfirst. This probably underestimates the mean recombination rate, so\nreionization may be a bit slower than our models predict (and begin\na bit later). On the other hand, simulations suggest that recombinations do not dramatically slow reionization, even if minihalos are\nincluded (Ciardi et al. 2005). Note that when recombinations are\nslow, equation (19) can be approximated as\n\u03b6fcoll\nx\u0304i \u2248\n,\n1 + n\u0304rec\n\n(21)\n\nwhere n\u0304rec is the mean cumulative number of recombinations per\nhydrogen atom.\n\n6 CRITICAL POINTS IN THE 21 CM HISTORY\nNow that we have assembled the relevant physics, we are ready\nto construct some plausible histories. But first it is useful to identify three \"critical points\" in the 21 cm history: the redshift zh\nat which the IGM is heated above T\u03b3 , the redshift zc at which\nthe Wouthuysen-Field mechanism couples first TS and TK (when\nx\u0303\u03b1 = 1), and the redshift of reionization zr . Their relative timing\ndetermines the structure of the 21 cm spectrum.\nThe most important question is whether zc occurs before the\nother two transitions: if not, the IGM will remain invisible. We can\ncompute the collapse fraction (or more precisely \u2206fcoll ) required\nto achieve x\u0303\u03b1 = 1 from equation (18). Substituting this into equa-\n\ntion (11), integrated over time, we have the net X-ray heat input\n\u2206Tc at zc :\n\u2206Tc\nT\u03b3\n\n\u223c 0.08\n\n\u0012\n\nfX,h fcoll 9690 1 0.6 0.023\n0.2 \u2206fcoll N\u03b1 S\u0303\u03b1 f \u0304rec \u03a9b h2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n20 3\n\u00d7\n.\n1+z\n\nfX\n\n\u0013\n(22)\n\nNote that \u2206Tc is independent of f\u22c6 because both the coupling and\nheating rates are proportional to the star formation rate (by assumption, of course). Interestingly, for fiducial (Pop II) parameters zc\nshould occur somewhat before zh (see also the simple models of\nChen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2004; Hirata 2005). For Pop III stars, N\u03b1\nis a factor of two smaller and fX may be significantly larger than\nunity, in which case absorption would be much less important. Thus\nthe presence or absence of a strong and extended absorption epoch\noffers a useful probe of high-redshift star formation.\nA similar estimate of the ionization fraction at zc yields\nx\u0304i,c\n\n\u223c 0.05\n\n\u0012\n\nfesc Nion fcoll 1 0.6 0.023\n1 + n\u0304rec N\u03b1 \u2206fcoll S\u0303\u03b1 f \u0304rec \u03a9b h2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n20 2\n\u00d7\n.\n1+z\n\n\u0013\n(23)\n\nFor Pop II stars, Nion /N\u03b1 \u2248 0.45; thus even in the worst case\n(fesc = 1 and n\u0304rec = 0) coupling would become efficient during the initial stages of reionization. However, Pop III stars have\nmuch harder spectra and Nion /N\u03b1 \u2248 7.6 In principle, it is therefore possible for Pop III stars to reionize the universe before zc .\nThis requires a small clumping factor, relatively late reionization\n(z <\n\u223c 10), and fesc \u2248 1. There is some theoretical motivation for\nsuch a large escape fraction in the earliest generation of galaxies\n(Whalen et al. 2004), but maintaining that in larger galaxies seems\nunlikely (as might widespread and dominant Pop III star formation\nat z < 10). More conventional histories, in which fesc <\n\u223c 0.2 or\n12\nfor\nPop\nIII\nstars,\npredict\nstrong\ncoupling\nthroughout\nreionzr >\n\u223c\nization (cf. Ciardi & Madau 2003).\nFinally, it is interesting to check whether we will see the IGM\nin absorption or emission during reionization. Combining equations (11) and (21), we find that the total heat input as a function of\nx\u0304i is\n\u2206T (x\u0304i )\n\u223c\nT\u03b3\n\n\u0010\n\nx\u0304i\n0.025\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\nfX\n\nfX,h 4800 10\nfesc Nion 1 + z\n\n\u0013\n\n(1 + n\u0304rec ). (24)\n\nThus, provided fX >\n\u223c 1 and Pop II stars dominate, it is safe to\nassume that the IGM is much warmer than the CMB throughout\nreionization. However, because Pop III stars have much higher ionizing efficiencies, it is possible for X-ray heating to become significant only when x\u0304i >\n\u223c 0.2; in this case we would be able to see the\nearly stages in absorption so long as fX remains small. This would\nbe exciting in that it would add extra structure to the reionization\nsignal, but it would also make isolating x\u0304i (z) more difficult.\n\n6 Note that Fig. 1 of Ciardi et al. (2003) seems to suggest much smaller\nratios for Pop III stars; this is because they report the number of photons per\nfrequency interval. The frequency range between Ly\u03b1 and the Lyman limit\nis much smaller than that available to ionizing photons, which accounts for\nthe difference.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe Global 21 cm Background\n\n7\n\n[!t]\n\nFigure 1.

In this panel, the two dotted lines show \u03b4Tb if shock heating is ignored.\n\n7 GLOBAL HISTORIES\nWe will now construct some example histories using the prescriptions given in \u00a73\u20135. Of course, given the uncertainties in each of\nthe parameters, making firm predictions is all but impossible. But\nwe can highlight the possible range of features. We will necessarily neglect a number of potentially important effects (such as metal\nenrichment and the evolution of the H2 cooling efficiency), but we\nhope that our histories are nevertheless representative of the possibilities.\n\n7.1 Pop II Stars\nWe begin with a fiducial set of Pop II parameters. We take mmin =\nm4 , f\u22c6 = 0.1, fesc = 0.1, fX = 1, Nion = 4000, and N\u03b1 =\n9690. (Thus \u03b6 = 40 for this model.) The solid curves in Figure 1\nshow the resulting global history. In panel (a), the dotted curve is\nT\u03b3 , the thin curves are TK , and the thick curves are TS (note that\nthey always interpolate between T\u03b3 and TK ).\nFigure 1b shows the ionization history. Without feedback, it\nincreases smoothly and rapidly over a redshift interval of \u2206z \u223c\n5. For these parameters, reionization is essentially complete at\nzr \u223c 7. Other values of \u03b6 move zr back and forth but do not\nstrongly affect its width in redshift space. Changing f\u22c6 affects all\nthree processes (nearly) equally: it simply moves the entire curve\nforward or backward in redshift. Note that the evolution slows\nsomewhat at x\u0304i >\n\u223c 0.8 and never quite reaches complete reionization; this is because the clumping factor C increases rapidly as\nx\u0304i \u2192 1 (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 2000). The dashed curves in this\npanel use photoheating feedback to slow reionization. Each assumes that the minimum virial temperature increases to Th =\n2 \u00d7 105 K in ionized regions, near the upper limit of theoretical expectations (Dijkstra et al. 2004). All other parameters are assumed to remain constant in photoheated regions. The two curves\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nchoose different prescriptions for the effective volume in which the\nfeedback occurs; they bracket the possible effects of photoheating\n(Furlanetto & Loeb 2005).7 Clearly, x\u0304i evolves monotonically even\nwith this relatively powerful negative feedback. It does, however,\nslow the pace of reionization when x\u0304i >\n\u223c 0.5, spreading it over a\n8\nsignificantly longer time interval.\nFigure 1c shows the 21 cm brightness temperature increment\n\u03b4Tb relative to the CMB. Here for convenience we have also labeled the corresponding observed frequency \u03bd = \u03bd21 /(1 + z),\nwhere \u03bd21 = 1420 MHz. The signal clearly has interesting structure. The most robust feature is the \u223c 30 mK drop in \u03b4Tb during\nreionization. For our fiducial parameters (and without feedback),\nthat spans a frequency interval of \u223c 35 MHz. In this model, recombinations are slow (delaying reionization by only \u2206z \u2248 1) and\nx\u0304i is essentially proportional to fcoll . Thus, unless the ionizing efficiency increases throughout reionization because of some positive\nfeedback mechanism (or if more massive galaxies drive reionization; Furlanetto et al. 2006), the signal is unlikely to have a much\nlarger gradient during reionization. But with feedback, it can be\nsignificantly smaller: in that case, \u03b4Tb falls to zero over \u2206z \u2248 8\n(\u223c 60 MHz here). It is this gradient that might allow us to isolate\nthe cosmological signal, so feedback will make its detection rather\nmore difficult.\nA stronger feature appears near zc and zh . At z >\n\u223c 20, the IGM\nis nearly invisible even though TK \u226a T\u03b3 . Once the first galaxies form, the Wouthuysen-Field effect becomes important and TS\n7 In detail, the short-dashed curve assumes that the photoheated volume is identical to the ionized volume, while the long-dashed curve calculates the photoheated volume without including recombinations. See\nFurlanetto & Loeb (2005).\n8 In fact, with these parameters feedback pushes z < 5, which is ruled out\nr\u223c\nobservationally. But that is of no consequence to us because we only wish\nto examine its qualitative effects on the 21 cm signal.\n\n\f8\n\nS. R. Furlanetto\n[!t]\n\nFigure 2. Global IGM histories for very massive Pop III stars. Panels are the same as in Fig. 1. The solid curve takes our fiducial Pop III parameters (without\nfeedback). The long-dashed lines take fesc = 1, the short-dashed lines take fX = 5, and the dot-dashed line (shown only in c) assumes fesc = 1 and\nfX = 5.\n\ndrops rapidly. Because N\u03b1 is large for Pop II stars, efficient coupling precedes the heating transition, allowing a relatively strong\nabsorption signal (\u03b4Tb \u2248 \u221280 mK) to appear by z \u223c 20. Absorption persists until z \u223c 15 (or \u03bd \u223c 90 MHz) before fading\ninto emission. Thus, for these fiducial parameters, the universe is\ncold when coupling becomes strong, but it still heats up well before\nreionization begins in earnest. The absorption epoch can therefore\nteach us about the appearance and spectral properties of the first\nsources of light in the universe (Tozzi et al. 2000; Sethi 2005), especially the relative importance of Wouthuysen-Field coupling and\nX-ray heating. This era also produces much sharper features than\nreionization itself: the signal changes by \u223c 110 mK over \u2206z \u2248 5\n(or \u2206\u03bd \u2248 20 MHz at such high redshifts). Thus, even though the\nforegrounds are also much larger at the lower frequencies, the early\nevolution may not be much harder to identify (especially if feedback substantially slows reionization).\nNote that our model predicts a significantly stronger absorption epoch than Chen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (2004); the difference lies\nin the assumed fX and in their assumption of a linearly increasing\nemissivity throughout reionization. In reality, structure formation\nproceeds exponentially at high redshifts, so the X-ray (and ionizing) luminosities most likely decline much more rapidly with redshift than assumed in their model. This permits a longer epoch of\nabsorption.\nThe other curves in Figure 1 illustrate how the evolution\nchanges with some of our input assumptions. First, the dot-dashed\ncurve assumes fX = 0.2 (near the value of Glover & Brand 2003).\nThis has no effect on x\u0304i , but it delays the heating transition by\n\u2206z \u223c 3. As a result, TS remains relatively close to T\u03b3 during\nthe beginning of reionization, and \u03b4Tb never reaches its peak value\nin emission. On the other hand, the absorption trough is deeper,\nthough it is still confined to z >\n\u223c 15. Also, we emphasize that the\nIGM remains visible throughout reionization, even when TS <\n\u223c T\u03b3 .\nThe two dotted curves in panel (c) show \u03b4Tb if we ignore\n\nshock heating. In this case, all of the IGM material remains cold.\nAt the high redshifts (z >\n\u223c 15) that are relevant here, shock heating in filaments affects <\n\u223c 10% of the IGM, so its effects on \u03b4Tb\nare modest. If weak shocks do occur outside of collapsing structures, the absorption epoch will be much weaker. Moreover, if heating is delayed until lower redshifts where structure formation has\nprogressed much further, shocks should have a much larger effect\n(Gnedin & Shaver 2004; Furlanetto & Loeb 2004).\n7.2 Population III Stars\nFigure 2 shows similar histories for Pop III stars. Here we take\nfiducial parameters (shown by the solid curves) mmin = m4 ,\nf\u22c6 = 0.01, fesc = 0.1, fX = 1, and Nion = 30, 000, yielding\n\u03b6 = 30; reionization ends at z \u2248 7 in this case, ignoring feedback.\nThe thermal history is similar to the Pop II case, except that the\ncoupling and heating transitions are much more closely spaced in\ntime because Pop III stars have relatively few soft-UV photons per\nhigh energy photon. As a result, TS \u2192 TK occurs just about when\nTK \u223c T\u03b3 . Thus, if Pop III stars dominate, the absorption epoch will\nlikely be considerably weaker \u2013 with a peak signal |\u03b4Tb | <\n\u223c 50 mK.\nIn general, with Pop III stars, we find that the time interval over\nwhich each quantity evolves is similar to the Pop II case, but the\npeak signals are up to a factor of two weaker because their spectra push the three transition points closer together. Thus detecting\nthe global signal will be somewhat harder if massive Pop III stars\ndominate throughout reionization.\nThe other curves use different input parameters. The longdashed curves take fesc = 1 (which may be appropriate for the\nfirst stars, Whalen et al. 2004, although it is likely an overestimate\nin larger galaxies). In this case the universe is obviously ionized\nmuch earlier, but the thermal history remains the same. As a result, reionization occurs while the IGM is still cold (see \u00a76). This\nwould complicate the interpretation of \u03b4Tb (z) (because temperac 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe Global 21 cm Background\n\n9\n\n[!t]\n\nFigure 3. Global IGM histories for a two-population model. Panels are the same as in Fig. 1. Both sets of curves assume Pop III stars form in cold regions and\nPop II stars form in hot regions (each with our fiducial parameters, except that f\u22c6 = 0.1 for Pop III stars).\n\nture fluctuations could be significant) but actually makes the reionization signal slightly stronger. The more important point is that the\nWouthuysen-Field effect is already strong, so fluctuations will appear throughout reionization: even though Nion /N\u03b1 \u2248 7 for these\nstars, coupling precedes reionization because each Ly\u03b1 photon is\nscattered many times. As suggested by equation (23), arranging it\nso that zc < zr requires extremely unusual parameters, so it is almost impossible to imagine that the IGM would be invisible during\nreionization.\nThe short-dashed curves assume fX = 5. This strongly increases the heating rate, further decreasing the strength and duration of the absorption epoch. On the other hand, this choice cleanly\nseparates the reionization and absorption epochs and yields a brief\nperiod where x\u0304i is small but the IGM strongly emits. It gives a\nsimilar total heating rate to Hirata (2005), who also predict weak\nabsorption.\nFinally, the dot-dashed curve (shown only in panel c) takes\nfesc = 1 and fX = 5. This is, in many ways, a \"worst case scenario\" for studying reionization, because it compresses all of our\ncritical points into a short time interval. Nevertheless, there remains\ninteresting structure during and even before reionization. The difference is that separating the effects of TS , TK , and x\u0304i will be more\ndifficult.\n\nreionization (Furlanetto & Loeb 2005) \u2013 but it provides a simple\nway to implement exceptionally strong feedback. As in Figure 1,\nthe solid and dashed curves bracket the effectiveness of photoheating feedback. In the fast case, there is a short period in which x\u0304i\novershoots because of the dramatic decline in ionizing efficiency\nbetween the Pop III and Pop II stars. The resulting recombination\nepoch is nevertheless shallow, and producing true \"double reionization\" scenarios requires pushing parameters in even more uncomfortable directions.\nNevertheless, Figure 3 shows that strong feedback can dramatically slow the later stages of reionization. For obvious reasons,\nphotoheating feedback becomes important when x\u0304i \u223c 0.5. Thus\nthe gradient remains more or less unchanged during the first half of\nreionization (and the absorption epoch is completely unaffected),\nbut it decreases strongly in the middle stages. Any potential \"recombination epoch\" is also difficult to see, because x\u0304i changes by\nonly \u223c 15% over \u2206z \u223c 4 (yielding d\u03b4Tb /d\u03bd \u223c 0.1 mK MHz\u22121 ).\nOn the other hand, if feedback is fast, the late stages of reionization are completed entirely by the Pop II objects and so have as\nlarge a gradient as the single-population models. Thus strong feedback could perhaps be inferred by observing two widely separated\nperiods with large gradients.\n\n7.3 A Dual Population History\n\n8 DISCUSSION\n\nIn Figure 3, we exaggerate the strength of the photoheating feedback transition by assuming that Pop III stars form in \"cold\" regions while Pop II stars form in hot regions. Both populations take\nour fiducial parameters except that we set f\u22c6 = 0.1 for Pop III stars.\nThus the ionizing efficiency declines from \u03b6 III = 300 to \u03b6 II = 40\nduring photoheating, and mmin simultaneously increases. There is\nno real physical justification for conflating the metallicity transition with photoheating \u2013 in fact it is much more gradual than photoheating and requires fine-tinuing to synchronize enrichment and\n\nIn this paper, we have described the basic mechanisms relevant to\ncomputing the globally-averaged 21 cm signal from high redshifts.\nThe basic structure of the background depends on three crucial\ntransition points: when TS \u2192 TK (due to the Wouthuysen-Field\neffect), when TK first exceeds T\u03b3 (most likely due to X-ray heating, possibly together with weak shocks), and reionization. The relative timing of these three transitions determines how much we can\nlearn from the 21 cm transition.\nWe have examined the range of possible signals and empha-\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f10\n\nS. R. Furlanetto\n\nsized their qualitative features. If Pop II stars dominate the background, and if their X-ray emission (per unit star formation rate)\nis comparable to that in the local Universe (fX \u2248 1), Ly\u03b1 coupling will become efficient before X-ray heating. This leads to a\nrelatively strong absorption epoch (with a peak |\u03b4Tb | \u223c 100 mK)\nuntil X-rays cause TK \u226b T\u03b3 . Once that occurs, \u03b4Tb saturates\nuntil reionization begins \u2013 which is well after the heating transition so long as fX >\n\u223c 1. Such histories contain long periods in\nwhich density fluctuations dominate the 21 cm signal, which is\nuseful for studying cosmological parameters (Bowman et al. 2005;\nMcQuinn et al. 2005). This points to an important benefit of our\ncalculation: it provides a basis for evaluating the expected amplitude of the 21 cm fluctuations during various phases of structure\nformation. Cosmological measurements, spin temperature fluctuations (Barkana & Loeb 2005b; Pritchard & Furlanetto 2005), minihalos (Iliev et al. 2002; Furlanetto & Oh 2006), and reionization itself must all be placed in their proper contexts, and this is a first\nstep in that direction.\nIf very massive Pop III stars dominate reionization, we expect a rather different history.9 Because these stars are so hot, the\nnumber of Ly\u03b1 photons per ionizing photon is much smaller. Thus\nthe Ly\u03b1 coupling transition occurs much nearer to reionization, although the reionization epoch will still be visible in the 21 cm transition. With these stellar populations, disentangling the effects of\nTS and x\u0304i may be more difficult. It would be even more complicated if the X-ray heating transition also occurs during reionization\n(which it could if we calibrate to the local X-ray luminosity-star\nformation rate relationship). On the other hand, they could easily\nhave much larger X-ray luminosities, perhaps eliminating the absorption epoch altogether.\nA substantial quasar population (seeded by the remnants of\nmassive Pop III stars, for example) could also eliminate the absorption epoch, because such objects have large X-ray luminosities. We have conservatively ignored this possibility because the\nknown population of bright quasars contributes little to reionization (Fan et al. 2004) and does not affect the thermal history significantly (Venkatesan et al. 2001), but this is not to say that \"miniquasars\" will be unimportant (Oh 2001; Glover & Brand 2003;\nMadau et al. 2004; Kuhlen & Madau 2005) \u2013 although they are unlikely to dominate the ionizing photon budget (Dijkstra et al. 2004;\nSalvaterra et al. 2005). These sources would only affect our predictions before X-ray heating from stars becomes significant \u2013 thus\nobserving the absorption epoch (or lack thereof) could help to constrain their significance. At lower redshifts, and especially during reionization, miniquasars are unimportant for the 21 cm background because stars easily suffice to heat the IGM above T\u03b3 .\nAnother uncertainty is our simple model for shock heating\n(Furlanetto & Loeb 2004). While it appears to provide a reasonable description of shocks produced as part of the cosmic web\n(Kuhlen et al. 2006), some simulations may imply that the lowdensity IGM could also host weak shocks (Gnedin & Shaver 2004).\nThese are not included in the model and deserve further study. As\nwith quasars, these would not affect our predictions during reionization, but they could shorten or even eliminate the absorption\nepoch.\nClearly, measuring the mean \u03b4Tb (z) would offer insight into\nthe earliest generation of luminous sources (Madau et al. 1997;\nShaver et al. 1999; Tozzi et al. 2000; Gnedin & Shaver 2004).

Brightness temperature as a function of x\u0304i in several different\nscenarios. We have removed the redshift dependence of the underlying signal for clarity. The solid and short-dashed curves show our fiducial Pop II\nand Pop III cases, respectively. The dotted curve uses sets fX = 0.2 for\nPop II stars, and the dot-dashed curve uses fesc = 1 and fX = 0.5 for\nPop III stars. Finally, the long-dashed curve corresponds to the solid curve\nin Fig. 3.\n\nuseful might these measurements be for quantitative constraints?\nSethi (2005) computed the sky-averaged 21 cm signal, including\nLy\u03b1 coupling, X-ray heating, and ionization in a restricted range\nof models (including non-uniform X-ray heating but ignoring Lyn\nphotons, Pop III stars, and feedback, for example). The qualitative features are similar to our Pop II models, although we predict\na much wider range of possibilities given the uncertainties in the\nmodels.\nTreating the efficiency of each process as a free parameter,\nSethi (2005) considered how well these parameters could be mea \u0304 b (z). Because (with Pop II stars) heating generally\nsured from \u03b4T\noccurs well before reionization, he found that x\u0304i (z) could be wellconstrained. We find considerably larger degeneracies. Figure 4\nshows the brightness temperature as a function of x\u0304i , with the expected redshift dependence of \u03b4Tb in a fully neutral universe removed. We show several different scenarios with a wide range of\nionizing and X-ray heating efficiencies. To determine x\u0304i precisely,\nwe would hope that all these curves would overlap. Indeed they do\napproach each other for x\u0304i >\n\u223c 0.5, but earlier in reionization the histories differ substantially. In most cases, the (1 \u2212 TS /T\u03b3 ) factor\nhas not yet saturated in this regime, either because of delayed Ly\u03b1\ncoupling (usually the case for Pop III stars) or relatively late Xray heating (particularly in the dotted curve). Thus we predict that,\nin the absence of other constraints, x\u0304i cannot be determined with\ncertainty from the 21 cm background alone unless it is large.\nThe most straightforward observation would be to measure\n\u03b4Tb (z) directly. Because this is an all-sky signal, single-dish measurements (even with a modest-sized telescope) can easily reach the\nrequired mK sensitivity. However, the much stronger synchrotron\nforegrounds (primarily from the Galaxy; see Furlanetto et al. 2006\nfor a review) nevertheless make such observations extremely diffic 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe Global 21 cm Background\n\nFigure 5.

Internal loads of sufficient quality may be difficult\nto find.\nFortunately, even if systematics do prove to be insurmountable, there are other ways to extract the mean signal. Cooray (2005)\npointed out that scattering by a massive, low-redshift galaxy cluster can shift the spectrum in frequency space, so that differential measurements between the cluster and background may reveal the global spectrum. This avoids many systematics, but given\nthe relatively small angular size of clusters may not measure the\ntruly \"global\" signal. A second possibility is to use the 21 cm\nfluctuation amplitude to measure the mean background, provided\nthree-dimensional anisotropies can be measured (Barkana & Loeb\n2005a). For example, McQuinn et al. (2005) showed that, when\ndensity (and velocity) fluctuations dominate the signal, the overall\nsignal amplitude can be extracted by combining 21 cm data with\nCMB data. (They phrased their constraint as x\u0304i , but in more general models it corresponds to the mean brightness temperature.)\nDespite these difficulties, the global 21 cm background would\nbe an extremely useful tool in understanding the overall evolution\nof the first sources of light. Together with the fluctuating signal\n(see Furlanetto et al. 2006 and references therein), the global background could reveal many of the important properties of the \"twilight zone\" of structure formation.\nI thank S.

As a rule of thumb, a \"quiet\" portion of the sky has a brightness temperature\nTsky \u223c 180\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd\n180 MHz\n\n\u0011\u22122.6\n\nREFERENCES\nK.\n\n(25)\n\nClearly, the amplitude of the cosmological signal will be impossible to extract from the foregrounds. But the spectral structure of\nthe 21 cm background imprints features on the (otherwise smooth)\nspectrum that may be separable. Figure 5 shows the expected gradients in a few of our models. During reionization, we typically have\n \u0304 b /dz < 1 mK MHz\u22121 , over three orders of magnitude smaller\nd\u03b4T\n\u223c\nthan the foregrounds. Without feedback, the gradients tend to increase throughout reionization; with feedback, they peak earlier on.\nThe gradients can be much larger during the absorption era, partly\nbecause the signal can vary over a much wider range and partly\nbecause d\u03bd/dz also decreases. Of course, the foreground gradients\nalso increase significantly at these low frequencies (by about an order of magnitude at \u03bd \u2248 90 MHz according to eq. 25), so it is not\nclear which regime will actually be easier to constrain. Separating\nthe cosmological signal promises to be a challenge (Shaver et al.\n1999; Gnedin & Shaver 2004) and will be easier in histories with\nstrong features (in which feedback does not slow reionization, for\nexample).\nThe limiting factors in direct measurements are likely to be\nsystematics (Shaver et al. 1999). Foregrounds vary across the sky,\nwhich couples to the frequency dependent beam and sidelobes\n(though the variation should be smooth and hence removable;\nOh & Mack 2003). One strategy to avoid confusion with features\nin the foreground is to use multiple (wide) fields, in which foregrounds are presumably uncorrelated but across which the cosmological signal would be constant. Hydrogen recombination lines\nleave spectral features throughout the relevant frequency range,\nbut they can be removed through follow-up observations with high\nspectral resolution. Finally, the biggest challenge will be calibratc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nBarkana R., Loeb A., 2001, Physics Reports , 349, 125\nBarkana R., Loeb A., 2005a, ApJ , 624, L65\nBarkana R., Loeb A., 2005b, ApJ , 626, 1\nBharadwaj S., Ali S.
