Instead, we find that at low temperatures, small system size transport\nproperties are dominated by disorder but the asymptotic system size dependence of current is given\nby the usual FPU result J \u223c 1/N 2/3 . We also present new interesting results on the binary-mass\nordered FPU chain.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIt is now generally believed that heat conduction in\none-dimensional (1D) systems is anomalous [1, 2]. In the\nabsence of an external pinning potential, as is the case in\nmost realistic situations, one finds that Fourier's law is\nnot satisfied. One of the predictions from Fourier's law\nis the scaling form of heat current J with system size N\nfor a system with a fixed applied temperature difference.\nFrom Fourier's law one gets J \u223c 1/N . The conclusion,\nfrom a large number of studies of 1D momentum conserving systems seems to be:\nJ\u223c\n\n1\nN 1\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03b1 6= 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe main results on the exponent \u03b1 can be summarized\nas follows: (1) for a pure harmonic chain J \u223c N 0 [3],\n(2) for a disordered harmonic chain \u03b1 depends on the\nspectral properties of the bath and on boundary conditions [4, 5, 6], and (3) for a nonlinear system without\ndisorder \u03b1 seems to be independent of properties of heat\nbaths and the results from the most recent simulations\nindicate a universal value of \u03b1 = 1/3 [2, 7].\nTransport in systems with both disorder and interactions has recently attracted a lot of interest both theoretically [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and experimentally [13]. The main\ninterest is to understand the transition from an insulating\nstate governed by the physics of Anderson localization to\na conducting state as one increases interactions. In the\ncontext of oscillator chains we note that the physics of the\ndisordered harmonic chain is dominated by localization\nphysics which has its strongest effect in 1D systems. The\nquestion of the effect of anharmonicity on localization\nwas recently addressed for a system where the harmonic\npart of the Hamiltonian included an external pinning potential and the anharmonicity was a quartic onsite potential [11]. In this case, in the absence of the anharmonic\nterm, J \u223c e\u2212cN . Surprisingly it was found that adding\na small amount of anharmonicity leads to a conducting\n(Fourier-like) behaviour with a power law decay J \u223c 1/N\nand no transition to the insulating state was found on de-\n\ncreasing the anharmonicity. An important feature seen\nwas that with decreasing anharmonicity one had to go to\nlarger system sizes to see the true asymptotic behaviour\nof the current.\nIn the present letter we investigate the same question,\nnamely that of the effect of interactions (phonon-phonon)\non localization, but in the absence of any external pinning potential. We study the mass disordered FPU model\nwith interactions put in through a quartic inter-particle\npotential. In the absence of pinning, for the harmonic\n<\ncase, low frequency modes with \u03c9 \u223c 1/N 1/2 remain extended and this gives rise to a power law dependence of\nJ on N [4, 5, 6]. On the other hand, for the pure FPU\nchain also, low frequency modes are believed to play an\nimportant role in transport and give rise to anomalous\ntransport. An earlier study by Li et al [8] on this model\nconcluded that this model showed a transition, from a\nFourier like scaling J \u223c 1/N at low temperatures, to\na pure FPU like behaviour with J \u223c 1/N 0.57 at high\ntemperatures. Our study suggests that this conclusion\nmay not be correct. We do not find any evidence of\na finite temperature transition. Instead we find that a\nsmall amount of anharmonicity leads to the same system\nsize dependence as seen in the pure system. We discuss\npossible sources of error in the conclusions of Li et al .\nWe also present new results on the ordered binary mass\nFPU chain including nontrivial scaling properties of the\nsystem size dependence of current.\nModel.- We consider the following FPU Hamiltonian:\nH =\n\nN\n+1\nN\nX\nX\n(xl \u2212 xl\u22121 )2\n(xl \u2212 xl\u22121 )4\np2l\n+\n[\n+\u03bd\n], (2)\n2ml\n2\n4\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\nwhere {xl , pl } denotes the position and momenta of particles and we use fixed boundary conditions x0 = xN +1 =\n0. The interparticle harmonic spring constant has been\nset to one and \u03bd denotes the strength of the quartic interaction. We consider a binary random alloy and set\nthe masses of half of the particles, at randomly chosen\n\n\f2\nsites, to m1 and the rest to m2 . The particles at the two\nends of the chain are connected to stochastic white noise\nheat baths at different temperatures. The equations of\nmotion of the chain are then given by:\n\nwith \u03b7l = \u03b7L \u03b4l,1 + \u03b7R \u03b4l,N , \u03b3l = \u03b3(\u03b4l,1 + \u03b4l,N ), and where\nthe noise terms satisfy the fluctuation dissipation relations h\u03b7L (t)\u03b7L (t\u2032 )i = 2\u03b3kB TL \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), h\u03b7R (t)\u03b7R (t\u2032 )i =\n2\u03b3kB TR \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), kB being Boltzmann's\nconstant. The\nP\nheat current is given by J = l hfl,l\u22121 \u1e8bl i/(N \u2212 1) where\nfl,l\u22121 is the force exerted by the (l \u2212 1)th particle on the\nlth particle and h...i denotes a steady state average. We\nwill denote by [J] an average over disorder. As noted\nin [11], Eqs. (3) are invariant under the transformation\nTL,R \u2192 sTL,R , {xl } \u2192 {s1/2 xl } and \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd/s. This implies the scaling relation J(sTL , sTR , \u03bd) = sJ(TL , TR , s\u03bd)\nand thus the effect of changing \u03bd can be equivalently\nstudied by changing TL , TR . In the present study we will\nfix temperatures and consider the effect of changing \u03bd.\nLet us consider first the harmonic case \u03bd = 0. In this\ncase it is known from detailed numerical work and analytic arguments that the exponent \u03b1 depends on the\nproperties of the bath and on boundary conditions. For\nwhite noise baths one finds \u03b1 = \u22121/2 for fixed boundaries and \u03b1 = 1/2 for free boundaries. In the presence\nof anharmonicity it is expected, and indeed we have verified in simulations, that \u03b1 does not depend on boundary\nconditions. Here we use fixed boundary conditions only.\nBefore presenting the results of simulations for the\nbinary-mass disordered anharmonic chain it is important\nto know the value of \u03b1 for the binary ordered chain. Let\nus thus discuss this first. This case was earlier studied\nin [7] where it was found that the temperature profile\nshowed oscillations with an amplitude that decreased as\nN \u22121/2 . Let us denote the mass ratio m1 /m2 = A. For\nA = 1, the simulations in [7] gave strong evidence for\nan exponent \u03b1 = 1/3. However for the value A = 2.62 a\nclear convergence could not be obtained. Here we will argue that the exponent remains unchanged from the A = 1\nvalue. In Fig. (1) we present simulation results for the N dependence of the current J in the binary-mass ordered\nchain for different values of the parameter A, all corresponding to the same average mass (m1 + m2 )/2 = 1.\nRemarkably we find that at large enough system sizes\nthe actual values of the currents for different A tend to\nconverge to the same value as the A = 1 value. Thus\nclearly the exponent \u03b1 remains unchanged for any value\nof A. However for a large mass ratio one has to go to\nlarge system sizes to see the true exponent. A similar effect was seen in Refn.[2] for the binary hard-particle gas.\nIn our simulations we used the velocity-Verlet algorithm\nwith time steps dt = 0.005 [14]. For small system sizes\nwe used O(107 ) \u2212 O(108 ) steps for relaxation and same\n\n0.01\nJ\n\nml \u1e8dl = \u2212(2xl \u2212 xl\u22121 \u2212 xl+1 )\n\u2212 \u03bd[(xl \u2212 xl\u22121 )3 + (xl \u2212 xl+1 )3 ] \u2212 \u03b3l \u1e8bl + \u03b7l , (3)\n\nA = 1.0\nA = 1.1\nA = 1.22\nA = 1.5\n\n0.001\n102\n\n2\n\n\u221d N\u22123\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\nN\nFIG. 1: Plot of the heat current J versus system size in the\nbinary mass ordered chain for different values of the mass\nratio A = 1.0, 1.1, 1.22 and 1.5.\n\nnumber of steps for averaging, while for larger systems,\nup to O(109 ) steps were used. In all our simulations we\nused TL = 1.25, TR = 0.75 and \u03b3 = 1.0.\nFor the disordered anharmonic case, we wish to study\nthe cases with weak and strong anharmonicity and see if\nthere is a transition in the value of \u03b1. For small \u03bd we\nexpect the system's behaviour to be close to a harmonic\none, and so one would have to go to very large system\nsizes to see the effect of anharmonicity and the correct exponent. It then becomes necessary to try and understand\nthe data using some sort of a scaling analysis. Let us first\ndo this for the ordered case. We fix the value of A = 1.5\nand look at the N -dependence of the current for different\nvalues of \u03bd. The results are shown in Fig. (2a). For small\nsystem sizes, we find a flat region which is expected since\nfor system sizes smaller than the phonon-phonon scattering length scale we expect the system to behave as a\nharmonic chain. The scattering length should be larger\nfor smaller \u03bd and this can be seen in the plot. At large\nenough system sizes all curves tend to show the same decay coefficient \u03b1 = 2/3. To see this clearly we scale the\nsystem size by a length factor l(\u03bd). Fig. (2b) shows a\nnice collapse of the data and the value of the exponent is\nconfirmed. We find empirically that the \u03bd-dependence of\nthe length parameter is given by l(\u03bd) = 1/ tanh(2\u03bd). We\nnote the interesting and somewhat surprising point that\nfor any given system size, the value of the current saturates as we keep increasing \u03bd. In Fig. (3a) we show the\ntemperature profiles for different system size for \u03bd = 0.1.\nAs noted earlier in [7] we see the large oscillations in\ntemperature. An interesting general feature of temperature profiles in FPU chains is the following. A coarsegrained temperature profile obtained by averaging over\nmany particles would be smooth and monotonic. However the temperature gradient is non-monotonic and this\nappears to be true even for small temperature differences.\n\n\f3\n\n0.1\n\n1.25\n\nJ\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n0.001\n\n= 0.02\n= 0.1\n= 0.3\n= 0.5\n= 0.7\n= 2.0\n= 4.0\n\nTl\n\n0.01\n\n103\n\nJ\n0.001\n\n104\n\n0.75\n1.25\n\n105\n\nN\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n= 0.02\n= 0.1\n= 0.3\n= 0.5\n= 0.7\n= 2.0\n= 4.0\n\nTl\n\n0.1\n\n1\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\n102\n\n2\n\n= 64\n= 256\n= 1024\n= 32768\n\n1\n\n0.75\n0\n\n\u03bd\n1\n\nN\nN\nN\nN\n(b)\n\n1/l(\u03bd)\n\n0\n\n= 64\n= 256\n= 1024\n= 32768\n\n(a)\n\n102\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\nN\nN\nN\nN\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nl/N\n\n103\n\n104\n\n105\n\nN/l(\u03bd)\n\nFIG. 2: Plot of the heat current J versus system size for the\nbinary mass ordered chain, for different values of \u03bd and with\nthe mass ratio A = 1.5 (a). Fig (b) shows the same data\nplotted with a scaled x-axis.\n\nThis implies that it may not even be possible to write a\nphenomenological relation such as J = \u2212\u03baN (T )\u2207T .\nFinally we now give the results for the disordered anharmonic case. We take averages over 50 \u2212 100 samples\nN < 1024, 10 samples for N = 1024 \u2212 16384, and 2 samples for N = 32768 and 65536. In Fig. (4) we plot the\nresults of simulations for [J] for \u03bd = 0.004 and 0.02. Also\nwe show the result for \u03bd = 0.0. For small values of \u03bd we\nsee that, at small system sizes the current value is close\nto the \u03bd = 0 value. As expected one has to go to large\nsystem sizes to see the effect of the weak anharmonicity.\nAt sufficiently large N we find the same system size dependence of [J] as obtained for the ordered FPU chain,\nnamely that given by \u03b1 = 1/3. In fact by scaling the\ncurrent by appropriate factors we find that the data for\nthe disordered case can be made to collapse on to the\nbinary-mass ordered case. This is shown in Fig. (5) (for\n\u03bd = 0.02, 0.1, 2.0). Thus our results show that the asymptotic power law dependence of the current is always dominated by anharmonicity while disorder only decreases the\noverall conductance of a sample. In Fig. (3b) we plot the\ntemperature profile for \u03bd = 0.1 and find that the asymptotic profile is similar to the ordered case. We now throw\nsome light on the reasons which led to the erroneous con-\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the temperature profiles in the (a) ordered\nand (b) disordered lattices for \u03bd = 0.1 and for different system\nsizes.\n\nclusions in [8], of a transition in conducting properties\nat low temperatures (or equivalently small anharmonicity). Consider the data for [J]N plotted in Fig. (4) for\n\u03bd = 0.004. We see that at around N \u223c 1000 \u2212 2000 the\ndata seems to flatten and if one had just looked at data in\nthis range, as was done by [8], one would conclude that\nFourier's law is valid. However the behaviour changes\ndrastically when one looks at larger system sizes and one\nagain gets the usual FPU behaviour. To verify that this\nis indeed what happens for the particular case studied by\nLi et al we have repeated simulations with their set of parameters but for much larger system sizes and the results\nare shown in the inset of Fig. (4). This case corresponds\nto a much smaller value of \u03bd and so it is expected that\nit will follow the \u03bd = 0 curve till very long length scales\nand this is clearly seen. However at around N = 16384\nwe see a tendency for the curve to turn up and we expect\nthat the same asymptotic behaviour to eventually show\nup. While a transition cannot be ruled out at even lower\ntemperatures, this seems unlikely. Also, if there is such\na transition, it should probably be to a disordered phase\nwith [J] \u223c 1/N 3/2 .\nTemperature dependence of conductivity.- The scaling\nproperty of the current, mentioned earlier [after Eq. (3)],\nimplies that the thermal conductivity has the form \u03ba =\n\u03ba(\u03bdT ). For small anharmonicity (\u03bd << 1), our earlier\nresults imply that at large system sizes \u03ba \u223c (N \u03bd)1/3\nand from the scaling property this immediately gives\n\n\f4\n\n50\n\n0.01\n[J]N\n\n[J]N\n\n20\n10\n\nvalues of \u03bd can be collapsed by scaling the system size by\na \u03bd-dependent length scale. Also we make the interesting and somewhat surprising observation that for a finite\nFPU chain, J \u2192 const 6= 0 as \u03bd \u2192 \u221e. Experiments\nmeasuring heat conduction in quasi-1D systems such as\nnanowires, nanotubes [15] are now being done. The effect of isotopic disorder has also been measured [16]. Our\nprediction is that while disorder will lower the current in\na wire, the system-size dependence of [J] is unaffected.\nExperimentally, the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity may be easier to measure and one can\nverify if this is unaffected by disorder.\n\n0.001\n102\n\nWN\n\u03bd = 0.0\nNH\nN\n103\n104\n\n5\n\u03bd = 0.02\n\u03bd = 0.004\n\u03bd = 0.0\n\n2\n1\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\nN\nFIG. 4: Plot of heat current versus system size, for the disordered anharmonic chain, for different values of \u03bd.

At low temperatures one\nhas to go to much larger system sizes to see the true exponent, whose value (\u03b1 = 1/3) is the same as that for\nthe ordered FPU chain. We also find several interesting\nnew results for the binary-mass ordered FPU chain: (i)\nthe exponent \u03b1 is independent of the mass ratio A and\nis the same as the A = 1 value, (ii) the data for different\n\nAD thanks Joel Lebowitz for useful discussions.
