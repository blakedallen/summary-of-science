In particular, continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has made remarkable achievements during\nthe past few years. Several CV-QKD schemes based on coherent states combined with homodyne or heterodyne detection have been proposed [3, 4] and experimentally demonstrated [5]\u2013[8], and the unconditional security of CV-QKD\nwith ideal optical source has also been systematically studied [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, there still have difficulties to\ncalculate the secure key rate of the CV-QKD protocols with\nnoisy coherent states, because of the absence of a good model\nto characterize the source imperfections. For instance, it is not\na good idea to ascribe the source imperfection to the channel\nexcess noise directly, which implies that Eve is able to control\nsuch noise. In this case, Eve actually knows that Alice is using\na P&M scheme instead of an E-B one, and the two schemes\nare no longer equivalent. Further more, from a practical viewpoint, it is suspicious to assume that Eve is able to control\nthe noise inside Alice's side. The same topic was discussed\nrecently [13], in which the noise of source and modulation\nis controlled neither by legitimate users nor eavesdroppers.\nHowever, under this assumption, Eve can not purify the states\nof Alice and Bob, which implies that the previous proof on\nthe optimality of Gaussian attacks [14] is not available. As\na result, the key rate derived in [13] may be insecure under\ncollective attack.\nTo solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a new\nway to characterize the source and modulation noise and derive a security bound of the CV-QKD protocol through a lossy\nand noisy channel. As we know, in a standard prepare and\nmeasurement (P&M) scheme, Alice generates two Gaussian\nrandom numbers, QA and PA , with mean values 0 and variances VA , to prepare |QA + iPA i by modulating an initial coherent state. Then, she sends this state to Bob through a\nquantum channel characterized by transmittance T and excess noise \u03b5C . Receiving the state, Bob randomly chooses one\n\n\u2217 Author\n\nto whom correspondence should be addressed.

The coherent state is\ngenerated in source (Src) with shot noise (\u03b4QA , \u03b4PA ), and then, its\ncentral position in phase space is displaced by Gaussian modulations\nwith (QA + \u2206QA , PA + \u2206PA ). The noise \u2206QA and \u2206PA is assumed to\nbe individually induced by a neutral party, Fred.\n\nquadrature to measure and informs Alice which observable he\nmeasured. Then, Alice and Bob should share two correlated\nGaussian variables, from which they can extract a private binary key with standard reconciliation and privacy amplification process. However, in a realistic case, the optical source\nand modulators are imperfect and inevitably induces extra excess noise (denoted by two Gaussian random numbers \u2206QA\nand \u2206PA ) to the coherent state. As a result, Alice actually prepares a state of |(QA + \u2206QA ) + i(PA + \u2206PA )i, where \u2206QA and\n\u2206PA , independent with QA and PA , have mean values 0 and\nvariances \u03b50 [13]. In a trusted-source model, neither Eve nor\nAlice can control this excess noise. So, it is convenient to phenomenologically assume that the noise of coherent state is not\ninduced by the imperfection of devices but by a neutral party,\nFred, who generates two random numbers, \u2206QA and \u2206PA , and\nthen introduces corresponding extra noise to the coherent state\nafter an ideal modulation (See Fig. 1). In this case, the state\nsent to Bob is denoted by quadratures (Q,P), which satisfy\nQ = QA + \u03b4QA + \u2206QA ,\nP = PA + \u03b4PA + \u2206PA ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nE A are originated from shot noise, and satisfy\nE \u03b4QADand \u03b4P\nD\n\u03b4Q2A = \u03b4P2A = 1, in shot-noise units.

Fred prepares \u03c1AB for Alice.\nIn order to prepare a coherent state for Bob, Alice can measure both\nquadrature of her beam with a balanced heterodyne detector.\n\nwhich shows the same result as in P&M scheme. Let us suppose the EPR source and the measuring apparatus of Alice are\nhidden in a black box. The only outputs of this black box are\nthe values of \u03b50 , QA and PA , and the beam (Q, P). For Eve, this\nblack box is indistinguishable from the equivalent black box,\nsketched in the P&M scheme. So, we can calculate the secure key rate in the E-B scheme. When Eve makes collective\nattacks, she interacts individually with each quantum state in\nthe same way. Accordingly, the global state |\u03c8ABF i becomes\n|\u03c8ABEF i. After Alice and Bob's measurements, Alice, Bob and\nEve should share correlated Classical-Classical-Quantum information (CCQ correlations) [16], and the security key rate\ncan be calculated by [17]\nKD = I(a : b) \u2212 \u03c7(a : E),\n\nvariance VQ|QA is [15]\n\nKR = I(a : b) \u2212 \u03c7(b : E),\n\nD E hQQA i2\nVQ|QA = Q2 \u2212 D E = (1 + \u03b50 ).\nQ2A\n\n(2)\n\nFor the convenience of theoretical analysis, here we propose an entanglement based (E-B) scheme and will show it is\nequivalent to the P&M scheme. As shown in Fig. 2, Fred prepares a pair of EPR beams \u03c1AB , and holds its purification. The\nglobal pure state shared by Alice, Bob and Fred is denoted by\n|\u03c8ABF i, and \u03c1AB is assumed to be a Gaussian state. Quadratures (Q, P) denote the state sent to Bob, and (Q\u2032 , P\u2032 ) denote\nthe state kept by Alice.

S (\u03c1E ) is\nthe von Neumann entropy of Eve's state \u03c1E , and S (\u03c1aE ) [S (\u03c1bE )]\nis the von Neumann conditional entropy of \u03c1E while knowing\nthe measurement value a (b) of Alice (Bob). However, since\n\u03c1ABE is not a pure state, and the optimality of Gaussian attacks\nhas not been proved, we can not calculate a minimum KD or\nKR directly. Fortunately, if we suppose the state of Fred can be\ncontrolled by Eve, and |\u03c8ABEF i is a pure state, we can derive a\nlower bound of KD or KR , denoted by K\u0303D and K\u0303R , where\nK\u0303D = I(a : b) \u2212 \u03c7(a : EF),\nK\u0303R = I(b : a) \u2212 \u03c7(b : EF),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c7(a : EF) and \u03c7(b : EF) are the Holevo bounds between Alice and the eavesdroppers.

The Shannon\nmutual information is given by I(a : b) =\n\u000e\n1/2 log2 (Vb Vb|a ), where Vb is the variance of the random variable of Bob, and Vb|a is the conditional variance of the random\nvariable of Bob while knowing Alice's measurement. Here,\nwe can only calculate the case of Q quadrature for the symmetry in Q and P. Let QB\u2032 be the result of Bob's measurement\non the Q quadrature and QA be Alice's best estimate of QB\u2032 .\nWe obtain\nD E\nVb = Q2B\u2032 = T (V + \u03c7),\nD E hQ Q \u2032 i2\n(13)\nVb|a = Q2B\u2032 \u2212 DA 2BE = T (1 + \u03c7),\nQA\n\nwhere \u03c7 = (1 \u2212 T )/T + \u03b50 + \u03b5c , and \u03b5c denotes the excess noise\nin the channel.

If \u03b50 = 0, K\u0303Rhom\nand KRhom are the same, otherwise K\u0303Rhom is obviously smaller\nthan KRhom , as shown in Fig. 3. The exact secure key rate is just\nbetween the solid line and the dash line. So we can estimate\nhow much information is lost when we use the lower bound.\nHowever, if the noise of the source is too large, the security\nbound will be too low and the gap between the solid line and\ndash line will be too large. In this case, it is hard to estimate\nhow much information we lose. This problem can be solved\nif we can effectively purify the coherent state and reduce the\nexcess noise [13].\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) The lower bound and the secure key rate as\na function of the transmittance of the channel; solid line\u2013K\u0303Rhom , dash\nline\u2013KRhom .\n\nWe will give a demonstration on how much the security bound\nis lower than the key rate derived in [13]. For comparing with\nthe result in [13], we just consider the effect of the noisy coherent states, and any excess noise in the channel is now assumed to be negligible.

Though the\nprotocol discussed is a P&M scheme, it is proved to be equivalent to an E-B scheme when we assume the noise in coherent\nstates is induced by Fred, a neutral party, who does not give\nEve any information. Though the state shared by Alice, Bob\nand Eve is not a pure state, and the secure key rate can not be\ncalculated directly, we can derive the maximal mutual information between Eve and Alice/ Bob, if she is able to acquire\nextra information from Fred. So, we actually derive a lower\nbound to the secure key rate. We also give a demonstration\nthat when the channel is lossy but noiseless, the lower bound\nbecomes lower than the key rate derived in [13] with the increase of the excess noise in the coherent states. We can also\npurify the noisy coherent states to get a better estimation on\nthe information lost.\nThe authors thank Xiang Peng and Bingjie Xu for fruitful discussions.
