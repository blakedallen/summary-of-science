In polymeric fluids, even though the amount of the\npolymer additives is very small, such a viscoelastic nonlinearity is effective. For decades, the understanding of the formation mechanism of the non-trivial flows due to nonlinear viscoelasticity has been\nof academic and industrial interest.\nThe nonlinearity originates from a viscoelastic stress augmented by the strain of flows and the\nfeedback of the elastic stress to flows. The target of our study is a flow pattern formation due to the\nnonlinear coupling in curvilinear channel shear flows. Flow pattern formations due to the nonlinear\ncoupling are typically observed in rod climbing, i.e. Weissenberg effect [2]. The rod climbing is caused\nby an elastic stress working to the centripetal direction of curved streamlines (called \"hoop stress\") as\nfollows. When a rotating rod is inserted into viscoelastic fluids, the rotating shaft forms shear flows in\nthe fluids. Because the shear flows stretch and align polymer molecules along streamlines, an elastic\nstress works to the inward direction of streamlines by the tension of elongated polymer molecules. The\nfluid transferred to the inward direction finally climbs up along the rod.\nThe earlier studies have shown that the hoop stress is also the primary effect inducing elastic instabilities in Taylor-Couette flows [3, 4]. In this system, perturbed radial flows cause additional hoop stress\nand the hoop stress then further intensifies the radial flows. The elastic instabilities are followed by flow\npattern formations including Taylor-Couette vortices, rotating standing waves, disordered oscillations,\nand time-dependent or time-invariant solitary vortices between the cylinders with rotational speed of an\n1\n\n\finner cylinder [5, 4, 6, 7]. Elastic instabilities in curvilinear shear flows are also observed in Taylor-Dean\nflow [8], cone-and-plate flow [9], and lid-driven cavity flow [10].\nThese instabilities occur even at very low or even zero Reynolds number Re \u226a 1. In this regime,\nelasticity-induced turbulence has also been observed in various experiments of shear flows including\nTaylor-Couette flow, von Karman swirling flow, and curvilinear channel flow [11, 12, 13]. The characteristics of the elastic turbulence are an increased flow resistance and efficient mixing at very low Reynolds\nnumber [14]. This mixing is very useful for industrial applications such as micro/nano devices [15].\nOur goal of the investigations is the understanding of the detailed mechanism of flow pattern formation, elastic instability, and elastic turbulence in viscoelastic curvilinear channel flows as employed\nin the experiments of elastic turbulence [12, 14, 16]. Although the previous studies concerning elastic\ninstabilities in curved flows have basically noticed a radial force due to the hoop stress, in this study,\nwe focus on the flow pattern transition caused by a streamwise elastic force, that is an elastic force in\nthe streamwise direction in curved streamlines. The transitions are characterized by the disappearance\nof the separation vortex and the emergence of a jet flow with the sudden variation of wall frictions, and\nare caused by the increase of streamwise flows along curved streamlines due to the streamwise elastic\nforce. Note that the flow pattern transition due to the streamwise elastic force is effective only when\nan inertial effect is also effective at moderate Reynolds number unlike the earlier elastic instabilities for\nRe \u226a 1. This indicates that the competition of the convective and elastic effects is essential for the flow\npattern transition in the curvilinear channel shear flows.\nIn order to investigate a detailed mechanism of flow pattern formation, direct numerical simulation\nis an effective approach on such complex flows. Nevertheless, earlier direct numerical simulations in\nthe context of elastic instabilities have not treated such complex flows but treated more simple flows\nincluding two-dimensional Kolmogorov and four-mill flows driven by external forcing in doubly-periodic\nboundary conditions which have no boundary walls [7, 17, 18]. Therefore, we perform direct numerical\nsimulations of periodic shear flows in two-dimensional wavy-walled channels as sketched in Fig. 1 as\na model of curvilinear channel shear flows with high-accuracy spectral element method. The periodic\nwavy-walled geometry is canonical for flows with open and curved streamlines [19] and has actually also\nattracted much attention for industrial applications such as compact heat exchangers [20, 21].\nIn this study, we investigate base laminar steady solutions for low to moderate Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Note that Newtonian flows in this system is linearly unstable at moderate Reynolds\nnumber [21] unlike two-dimensional Taylor-Couette and Taylor-Dean flows of viscoelastic fluids [22, 23].\nThis linear instability may show that viscoelastic fluid flows are also linearly unstable in wavy-walled\nchannels. We expect that the study of the base solutions leads to future elastic instability investigations.\nThis paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 provides governing equations and several nondimensional parameters. A numerical method, boundary conditions and a flow geometry are described\nin Sec. 3. The validation of our computations is done and parameter values used in this study are\nsummarized in Sec. 3. Section 4 shows the main results of our study. First, the steady solutions is\nclassified into three groups according to the flow patterns. Second, the variation of a viscous wall\nfriction, a flow rate, and an elastic wall friction with Weissenberg number is described. Third, we\ndescribe the mechanism of the flow pattern transition and the variation of the above flow characteristics\nby utilizing the relationship among the norms of the terms in the Navier-Stokes equation and among\nlocal forces. Fourth, we perform scaling analyses in order to confirm the relationship of the norms.\nFifth, the flow pattern formation in Poiseuille-type flows driven by constant body force are also shown.\nSection 5 is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\nBasic equations\n\nThe equations governing viscoelastic fluid flows consist of an equation of continuity, a momentum equation and a constitutive equation describing the temporal evolution of a rheological state. We employ\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes equation for the momentum equation and the FENE-P model for the\n\n2\n\n\fconstitutive equation. The governing equations are written in the following dimensionless form:\n\u2207 * u = 0,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202u\nRe\n+ (u * \u2207)u = \u2212\u2207p + \u03b2\u22072 u + \u2207 * \u03c4 ,\n\u2202t\nWi\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2202C\n+ (u * \u2207)C \u2212 (\u2207u)T * C \u2212 C * (\u2207u) \u2212 \u03ba\u2206C\n\u2202t\n+(f (r)C \u2212 I) = 0,\n1\u2212\u03b2\n(f (r)C \u2212 I),\nWi\nK\nf (r) =\n, K = 1 \u2212 3/L2 ,\n1 \u2212 r2 /L2\n\u03c4 =\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere u is the velocity, p is the pressure, and \u03c4 is the extra-stress tensor. C is the conformation tensor\nand L is the maximum polymer length.\nThe equations include the following non-dimensional parameters: the Reynolds number, the Weissenberg number, and the viscosity ratio parameter. The Reynolds number is the ratio of an inertial\nforce to a viscous force defined in the following way:\nRe = \u03c1U0 L0 /\u03b7,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the fluid density, L0 is the typical length of flow geometry, and U0 is the typical flow speed.\n\u03b7 = \u03b7s + \u03b7p is the total viscosity defined as the sum of the solvent viscosity \u03b7s and the polymer viscosity\n\u03b7p . The Weissenberg number is the ratio of a polymer relaxation time and a typical flow time:\nWi = \u03bbU0 /L0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the Zimm relaxation time. The viscosity ratio parameter is the ratio of the solvent viscosity\nand the total viscosity:\n\u03b2 = \u03b7s /\u03b7.\n(8)\nFrom the microscopic viewpoint, the FENE-P model is derived from a kinetic theory [24] and the\npre-averaging closure approximation introduced by Peterlin [25] concerning elastic polymer dumbbells\nconsisting of two beads and a spring connecting them. The conformation tensor C represents a measure\nof the second-order moment of the end-to-end distance vector of polymer dumbbells:\nCij = hri rj i,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere r is the relative difference of two beads positions. The function f (r) in Eq. (5) is so-called Peterlin\nfunction, which limits the length of polymers to be lower than the maximum polymer length L. When\nL \u2192 \u221e, the FENE-P model coincides with the Oldroyd-B model, which is derived from a kinetic theory\non linear Hookean dumbbells.\nBecause the FENE-P model reproduces the flow properties qualitatively similar to those observed\nin experiments, for example \"shear thinning\" [26], the FENE-P model has been frequently employed in\nmany studies on drag reduction [27, 28] , elastic instability [29, 7], and the other general viscoelastic\nfluid flows. We hence adopt the FENE-P model as a constitutive equation.\n\n3\n\n\f2.1\n\nAdditional diffusive term\n\nIn order to avoid numerical instabilities, we add an artificial diffusive term \u03ba\u22072 C in the constitutive\nequation (3), where \u03ba is the artificial constitutive diffusivity coefficient. The artificial diffusive term\nadded to the constitutive equation physically originates from the Brownian motion of the center-ofmass of elastic dumbbells across streamlines [30]. Sureshkumar [31] investigated the influence of the\naddition of the artificial diffusive term on flow stability in detail. They concluded that sufficiently small\nartificial diffusivity coefficient (\u03ba \u2264 10\u22123 ) does not affect the critical eigenmodes of the viscoelastic\nOrr-Sommerfeld problem though the artificial diffusivity coefficient needed for numerical stabilization is\nmuch larger than the values physically obtained in the earlier study [30]. This implies that sufficiently\nsmall artificial diffusivity coefficient does not qualitatively change flow behavior of viscoelastic fluids\nfrom the viewpoint of numerical instabilities. This additional diffusivity hence has been widely used\nin the calculations of viscoelastic fluid flows governed with the Oldroyd-B, FENE-P, and other models\n[18, 32].\n\n3\n3.1\n\nNumerical method\nSpectral element methods\n\nWe adopt spectral element method (hereinafter referred to as SEM) to numerically solve the governing\nequations in a complex geometry such as wavy-walled channels with high accuracy [33, 34, 35]. In\nSEM, a computed domain is subdivided into several spectral elements. The values of variables and the\nderivatives of the variables are interpolated through the values on grid points with Lagrange polynomial\ninterpolation functions in the elements [36]. Numerical errors between numerical solutions and accurate\nsolutions are reduced in two ways in SEM. First, the increase of the polynomial degree of interpolation\nfunctions results in exponential convergence of numerical accuracy for sufficiently smooth solutions [37].\nSecond, the increase of the number of elements leads to an algebraic convergence similar to that of\nfinite element calculations. SEM thereby enables the calculations with flexible boundary conditions\nand high numerical accuracy which are advantages of finite element methods and spectral methods,\nrespectively. Because the local mesh refinement is required for viscoelastic calculations due to an elastic\nstress enhancement near walls, we provide more grid points near walls as shown in Fig. 1(b).\nThe Galerkin formulation of the primitive equations (1)-(3) is used for spatial discretization in SEM.\nThe Galerkin formulation in a two-dimensional domain \u03a9 is written as follows:\nZ\n(\u2207 * u)qd\u03a9 = 0,\n(10)\n\u03a9\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u2202u\n* wd\u03a9 \u2212\n\u2202t\n\nZ\np(I : \u2207w)d\u03a9 + Re [(u * \u2207)u] * wd\u03a9\n\u03a9\nZ \u03a9\nZ\n\u03c4 : (\u2207w)d\u03a9 = 0,\n+\u03b2 (\u2207u : \u2207w)d\u03a9 +\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\n(11)\nZ \u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2202C\nT\nWi\n+ (u * \u2207)C \u2212 ((\u2207u) * C) \u2212 C * (\u2207u) : Sd\u03a9\n\u2202t\n\u03a9\nZ\nZ\n+Wi (\u03ba\u2207C) : (\u2207S)d\u03a9 + (f (r)C \u2212 I) : Sd\u03a9 = 0\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\n(12)\nwhere the tensor product is defined for two arbitrary tensors P and Q as:\nP : Q = Pij Qij ,\n4\n\n1 6 i, j 6 2\n\n(13)\n\n\fNel\n192\n\nNv\n6\n\nLx\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b2\n0.5\n\nL2\n1.0 \u00d7 104\n\n\u03ba\n1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nTable 1: Grid point numbers and parameter values fixed in this study.

The pressure p and the test function q belong to the\nfunctional space Q \u2282 L2 (\u03a9). The velocity u and the test function w belong to the space W \u2282 H 1 (\u03a9)2 .\nThe conformation tensor C and the test function S belong to \u03a3 \u2282 H 1 (\u03a9)2\u00d72 . Here L2 (\u03a9) and H 1 (\u03a9)\nrepresent the space of square-integrable functions and the space of derivative functions whose first order\nderivatives are square-integrable on \u03a9. The integral of these equations is performed with Lagrange\ninterpolation functions and quadrature rules. Finally, nonlinear algebraic equations described with\noperator matrices and vectors of variables are derived. The linear terms are discretized by a secondorder backward difference (BDF2) scheme and the nonlinear terms are discretized by a second-order\nextrapolation (EX2) scheme. We adopt a decoupled approach to solve time-splitting equations [38].\n\n3.2\n\nBoundary condition\n\nNo-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the upper and bottom walls for the velocity. The boundary\nintegral, which stems from the partial integral of the artificial diffusive term of the constitutive equation,\nassumes to be zero for numerical convenience. A periodic boundary condition is imposed on the velocity\nand the conformation tensor on inflow and outflow boundaries. No boundary condition is imposed on\nthe pressure because the pressure has no grid points on the boundaries.\nWe mainly investigate Couette-type flows in which the upper wall is at rest and constant speed is\ngiven on the bottom wall. The wall speed of the bottom wall is normalized to unity along tangential\ndirections t denoted in Fig. 1(a) at every point on the bottom wall. We also investigate Poiseuille-type\nflows in which both the upper and bottom walls are at rest.\n\n3.3\n\nParameters\n\nHere, we summarize the parameters used in this study: (1) fluid and rheological parameters are the\nReynolds number Re, the Weissenberg number Wi, the viscosity ratio parameter \u03b2, and the maximum\npolymer length L, (2) geometric parameters are the wall amplitude A and the periodic length Lx defined\nat Sec. 3.5, (3) the artificial diffusivity coefficient \u03ba. We focus on the dependence of flow behavior on\nthe Reynolds number, the Weissenberg number, and the curvature of streamlines controlled by the wall\namplitude A. The other parameters \u03b2, L, \u03ba, and Lx are fixed to the values shown in Tab. 1. We set\nthe maximum polymer length L to the sufficiently large value L2 = 1.0 \u00d7 104 in order to capture the\ninfluence of a large elastic stress on fluid flows. The values of the fixed parameters \u03b2, L, and \u03ba have been\nfrequently used in the previous numerical studies of viscoelastic fluid flows [18, 7, 31, 32]. Our several\ntest runs show that these parameter values do not qualitatively influence the flow behavior obtained in\nthis study.\n\n3.4\n\nValidation of our computations\n\nValidation of our numerical code is done on plane-Couette flows. We perform the calculations at the\nlow Weissenberg number Wi = 1.0 with zero artificial diffusivity coefficient \u03ba = 0 and at the high\nWeissenberg number Wi = 20.0 with the finite artificial diffusivity coefficient \u03ba = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nWe compare our numerical solutions with exact steady solutions of the FENE-P model. The exact\nsolutions of plane-Couette flows of the FENE-P model are derived as the roots of the following equations\n(14) and (15) obtained from the original equations under the condition that the derivatives of all variables\n\n5\n\n\fNel\n48\n192\n48\n192\n48\n192\n\nNv\n4\n6\n4\n6\n4\n6\n\nWi\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n20.0\n20.0\n\nL2\n10.0\n10.0\n1.0 \u00d7 104\n1.0 \u00d7 104\n1.0 \u00d7 104\n1.0 \u00d7 104\n\n\u03ba\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n1.0 \u00d7 103\n1.0 \u00d7 103\n\n|\u03c4yy |\n3.487 \u00d7 10\u22127\n4.200 \u00d7 10\u22129\n2.999 \u00d7 10\u22127\n1.583 \u00d7 10\u22129\n5.609 \u00d7 10\u22127\n1.050 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\nTable 2: Absolute value of the extra-stress component \u03c4yy with several parameter values for validation\nof our numerical code.\nwith respect to x are zero, p = const, ux = 1 \u2212 y, and uy = 0:\n3\n2Wi2 Cyy\n+ (L2 K + 2)Cyy \u2212 L \u2212 2 = 0,\n2\nCxy + WiCyy\n= 0,\n\nCxx \u2212 L2 + (L2 K + 1)Cyy = 0.\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nThe conformation tensor C of the exact solutions is uniform in the whole domain and the extra-stress\ncomponent \u03c4yy is zero everywhere. We calculate the extra-stress component \u03c4yy for Validation of our\ncomputations.\nTable. 2 shows the absolute values of the extra-stress component \u03c4yy with several parameter values.\nThe difference between our results and the exact solutions is within 10\u22126 for the wide range of parameter\nvalues. Moreover, numerical accuracy is improved with mesh refinements.\n\n3.5\n\nflow geometry\n\nThe governing equations are solved in the domain sketched in Fig. 1(a). Two sinusoidal curves are\nboundary walls. The coordinates of the upper and bottom walls are defined as follows:\n(upper):\n\ny\n\n= 1 + A sin(2\u03c0x/Lx ),\n\n(bottom):\n\ny\n\n= A sin(2\u03c0x/Lx ),\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of wall corrugations and Lx is the length of the periodic channel in the direction\nof x. The width of the channel is normalized to unity. We denote this channel \"sinuous channel\" as\ncalled by Cho [21]. We call the regions denoted as \"a\" and \"e\" in Fig. 1(a) \"outward region\" because\nthese regions are located in the outward position of curved flows parallel to the wall. We similarly call\nthe regions denoted as \"b\" and \"d\" in Fig. 1(a) \"inward region\". The regions denoted as \"c\" and \"f\" in\nFig. 1(a) are expressed \"contraction region\" in this paper. The symbols \"t\" and \"n\" denote a tangential\nand a normal directions to the wall, respectively.\nWe adopt the sinuous channel in this study for the following reasons. First, the channel has mixedkinematics with both shear and extensional flows. The elastic stress due to polymer stretching in\nthese flows strongly influences flow behavior. Second, we can easily control the magnitude of shear\nand extension by changing the wall amplitude A and the periodic length Lx of the channel. Third,\nstreamlines are highly curved in the channel. The curvature of streamlines locally varies and the sign\nof the curvature is even reversed along the streamlines unlike two-dimensional Taylor-Couette flows in\nwhich the sign of the curvature is not changed along streamlines. The spatial variation of the curvature\nleads to the change of the magnitude and the direction of an elastic hoop stress referred at Sec. 1. The\nspatial variation of the hoop stress plays a crucial role in the formation of flow patterns as described\nbelow.\nDespite the importance of the sinuous channel, most of the earlier works of viscoelastic fluid flows\nin wavy-walled channels have considered corrugated (contraction/expansion) channel flows in which the\nphases of sinusoidal curves of an upper and a bottom walls are shifted in a half wavelength [39, 19, 40, 41].\n6\n\n\f(b) 1.5\n\ny\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nx\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) (a) Flow domain with symbols and expressions. The regions \"a\" and \"e\" are\nthe outward regions, \"b\" and \"d\" are the inward regions, and \"c\" and \"f\" are the contraction regions.\nThe symbols \"t\" and \"n\" denote a tangential and a normal directions to the boundary wall, respectively.\n(b) Computational mesh used in this study.\nThe studies of the sinuous channel flows are limited to those of Newtonian fluid flows [20, 21]. However,\nthe corrugated channel is not appropriate for our study focusing on the curvilinear channel flows because\nthe streamlines of a bulk flow in the corrugated channel are more weakly curved than those in the sinuous\nchannel.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nResults\nFlow pattern transition and classification of steady solutions\n\nWe perform direct numerical simulations for the wide range of Weissenberg number 0 \u2264 Wi \u2264 20 and\nReynolds number 0 \u2264 Re \u2264 1000. We obtain steady solutions in these regions.\nThe steady solutions are classified into three groups. The three groups correspond to three regions in\nthe Wi-Re parameter space as shown in Fig. 2. We call the three regions \"convective\", \"transition\", and\n\"elastic\" regions. The two Weissenberg numbers separating adjacent regions is called first and second\ncritical Weissenberg numbers, Wic1 and Wic2 , defined at Sec. 4.3. Wic2 is extrapolated into a large-Re\nregion using a fitting function because our numerical calculations suffer numerical instabilities at large\nWi and Re shown in the region with diagonal lines in Fig. 2.\nThe difference of the steady solutions in the three groups typically appears in the flow patterns of\nthe steady solutions. Figures 3 and 4 show streamlines and flow-speed profiles of the steady solutions\nin the convective region Wi = 1.0, the transition region Wi = 5.16, and the elastic region Wi = 8.0 at\nthe moderate Reynolds numbers Re = 200 and 400. Figures 3(a) and 4(a) show that, in the convective\nregion, the flow field consists of a bulk shear flow and a vortex in the outward region (a) (see the\ndefinition of the outward region (a) in Fig. 1(a)). We call the vortex \"separation vortex\" because the\nvortex is detached from the bulk flow in the channel. The separation vortex has a symmetrical shape\nat low Wi, while the vortex becomes smaller and the symmetry of the vortex becomes gradually broken\nwith Wi. The separation vortex is finally vanished or becomes very small near the upper wall at Wic1\nas shown in Fig. 3(b). As discussed in detail, the depression of the separation vortex is just caused by\nthe increase of flow due to the streamwise elastic force in the outward region (a). The separation vortex\nreappears and subsequently grows with Wi as shown in Fig. 3(c).\nThe other difference of flow patterns in the three regions is \"jet flow\" observed in the vertical section\nof flow velocity. Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the vertical sections of the velocity component ux at x = \u03c0/4\nwith Re = 200, 400, and 800. We define jet flows the region in which the velocity is larger than in\n7\n\n\fWic1\n\nReynolds number Re\n\n1000\n\nWic2\n\n800\n600\n\ntransition\nregion\n\n400\n\nconvective region\n\n200\n\nelastic region\n\n70\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nWeissenberg number Wi\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Phase diagram of the base steady solutions in the plane of Wi and Re. The left\nand right curves denote the first and second critical Weissenberg numbers, Wic1 and Wic2 , defined at\nSec. 4.3, respectively. The Reynolds number of the edge point on the left curve Re = 70 is determined\nthrough the scaling analysis at Sec. 4.4. The curve of Wic2 is extrapolated to a large-Re region using\na fitting function. The value of Wic2 at Re = 0 is the Weissenberg number at which the separation\nvortex emerges. The region with diagonal lines represents that in which our calculations suffer numerical\ninstabilities.\nthe surrounding area. Jet flows whose velocity is larger than wall speed (unity) are observed near the\nbottom wall 0.5 < y < 0.7 in the convective region as shown in the curves [a]-[c] in Figs. 5(a), 6(a),\nand 7(a). The jet flows near the bottom wall suddenly disappear at Wic1 as shown in the curve [d] in\nFigs. 5(a), 6(a), and 7(a). Simultaneously, jet flows appear near the upper wall as shown in the same\nvelocity profiles. The jet flows near the upper wall are broader than those near the bottom wall in the\nconvective region. The jet flows gradually reach to the bottom wall with Wi during the transition region\nas shown in the curves [d] and [e] in Figs. 5(a), 6(a), and 7(a). In the elastic region, the jet flows are\nrepeatedly present near the bottom wall though the jet flows are slower and broader than those in the\nconvective region as shown in the curve [f] in Fig. 5(a), 6(a), and 7(a). The emergence of the jet flows\ndoes not depend on Re except the jet flows at larger Re is broader in the elastic region. As described\nbelow in detail, the jet flows are also caused by an streamwise elastic force due to polymer stretching\nin viscoelastic fluid flows. Note that negative-velocity regions appear near the upper wall as shown in\nthe velocity profiles magnified near the upper wall in Figs. 5(b), 6(b), and 7(b). These negative-velocity\nregions exist in the separation vortices in the outward region (a) as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.\nThe jet flows are also observed in the flow-speed profiles as shown in the right figures in Figs. 3 and\n4. In the convective region, the bright regions in the inward region (b) correspond to the jet flows. In\nthe transition region, the jet flows correspond to the regions where the flow speed is larger than the\nsurrounding area, from the outward region (a) to the contraction region (c) near the upper wall. In the\nelastic region, the jet flows emerge from the contraction region (c) to the contraction region (f) via the\ninward region (b) near the bottom wall.\nWe call the change of flow patterns including the separation vortex and the jet flow in the three\nregions \"flow pattern transition\".\n\n8\n\n\f(a) 1.5\n\nWi = 1.0\n\n0.5\n\ny\n\ny\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n(b) 1.5\n\n1.5\nx\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0.5\n\ny\n\ny\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nx\n\n(c) 1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\ny\n\ny\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n1\n\n1.5\nx\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nx\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nWi = 5.16\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nx\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\nWi = 8.0\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n3\n\n1.2\n1\n\n0\n\nWi = 5.16\n\n0\n\nWi = 1.0\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nWi = 8.0\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n3\n\n1.2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nx\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) Streamlines (left) and flow-speed profiles (right) of the steady solutions in (a)\nthe convective region Wi = 1.0, (b) the transition region Wi = 5.16, and (c) the elastic region Wi = 8.0\nat Re = 200.

How the change of\nflow patterns influences characteristic quantities of flows such as a wall friction and a flow rate? In this\nsubsection, we show the dependence of a viscous wall friction, an elastic wall friction, and a flow rate\non Wi at Re = 200 and 400.\n4.2.1\n\nLaminar drag reduction\n\nThe flow pattern transition described in the previous subsection accompanies the abrupt change of a\nviscous wall friction. The viscous wall friction is very important for engineering applications to the\ncontrol of the loss of flow rate.\nWe define the average viscous wall friction (viscous drag) acting on the walls of the channel as follows:\nZ\n\u2202ut\n1\nd\u0393,\n(16)\n\u03b2\n\u03c4vwf =\nS\u0393 \u0393\n\u2202n\nwhere \u0393 represents the total of the bottom boundary \u03931 and the upper boundary \u03932 .

The\nviscous drag is abruptly reduced at Wic1 , while the viscous drag gradually grows in the convective and\nelastic regions. The abrupt reduction of the viscous drag simultaneously occurs with the vanishment of\nthe separation vortex.\nWe call the drag reduction in laminar steady flows \"laminar drag reduction\".

In the elastic region, the growth of the flow rate is relaxed.\n4.2.3\n\nGrowth of flow resistance\n\nIn this subsection, we evaluate the following average elastic wall friction:\nZ\n1\n\u03c4tn d\u0393,\n\u03c4ewf =\nS\u0393 \u0393\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c4tn is a component of the extra-stress tensor in the coordinate which consists of two base vectors.\nOne is a tangential unit vector (denoted as t) and the other is a normal unit vector (denoted as n) as\nshown in Fig. 1(a). This elastic wall friction represents a flow resistance resulting from the elastic stress.\nThe sum of the viscous and elastic wall frictions is a total flow resistance acting on the walls.\nFigure 10 shows the elastic wall friction as a function of Wi at Re = 200 and 400. At Wic1 , the\nelastic wall friction suddenly grows. The sudden growth of the flow resistance also simultaneously occurs\nwith the vanishment of the separation vortex described at Sec. 4.1.\n\n4.3\n\nContribution of elastic force onto the flow pattern transition\n\nIn this subsection, we first introduce the norm of the absolute value of each term in the Navier-Stokes\nequation. We next elucidate the mechanism of the flow pattern transition by utilizing the relation among\nthe norms.\nThe norm of the absolute value of each term is defined in the following way:\nZ\nkRe(u * \u2207)uk =\n|Re(u * \u2207)u|d\u03a9.\n(19)\n\u03a9\n\n14\n\n\f70\n\nelastic wall friction \u03c4ewf\n\n60\n50\ntransition region\n(Re=200)\n\n40\n30\n\nconvective region\n(Re=200)\n\n20\n\nelastic region\n(Re=200)\n\n10\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5.16 6 6.45\n\n8\n\n10\n\nWeissenberg number Wi\n\nFigure 10: (Color online) Average elastic wall friction \u03c4ewf as a function of Wi at Re = 200 and 400.\nTwo vertical lines represent the first and second critical Weissenberg numbers at Re = 200.\nFigure 11 shows the absolute-value norms of the convective term kRe(u * \u2207)uk, the pressure gradient\nterm k\u2207pk, the elastic term k\u2207 * \u03c4 k, and the viscous term k\u03b2\u22072 uk in the Navier-Stokes equation as a\nfunction of Wi at Re = 200.\nWe define the first critical Weissenberg number Wic1 as the Weissenberg number at which the norm\nof the elastic term intersects with that of the pressure gradient term. The second critical Weissenberg\nnumber Wic2 is similarly defined as the Weissenberg number at which the norm of the pressure gradient\nterm crosses with that of the convective term.\nWe calculate the maximum speed of flows in the separation vortex as an intensity of the separation\nvortex. The maximum speed is defined in the following way. We consider the region where ux < 0 in\nthe channel. This region exists in the separation vortex as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 5(b). We calculate\nthe maximum value of the flow speed |u| in this region. When the separation vortex is vanished, the\nregion where ux < 0 also disappears. Then, the maximum speed is set to zero. In Fig. 12, we show\nthe maximum speed as a function of Wi at Re = 100 and 200. This figure shows that the first critical\nWeissenberg number Wic1 coincides with the Weissenberg number at which the separation is suddenly\ndepressed.\nThe second critical Weissenberg number provides an estimate of the Weissenberg number at which\nthe jet flows reach to the bottom wall in the transition region, though the estimate is less exact than\nthe accordance of Wic1 to the Weissenberg number at which the separation vortex is depressed.\nWe subsequently describe the mechanism of the flow pattern transition. Here, we utilize the profiles\nof the pressure and the conformation tensor as well as the norms of the terms for the description. Figures\n13 and 14 display the profiles of the pressure and the trace of the conformation tensor Tr(C) in the\nconvective, transition, and elastic regions at Re = 200. The trace of the conformation tensor represents\nthe magnitude of polymer stretching. Note that the pressure is fixed to zero at the given point. Negative\npressure at certain point then represents the pressure smaller than at the reference point. In these\nfigures, we can see the local relation among elastic force, pressure gradient, and centrifugal force defined\nas Re(u2t /R) where R is the curvature radius of streamlines. Here, we notice that the streamwise elastic\nforce plays a key role in the flow pattern transition as well as the hoop stress. Figure 15 schematically\nsummarizes the transition of the local relation among the forces in the three regions. At the subsequent\nsubsections, we describe the flow pattern transition in the three regions by utilizing these quantities.\n\n15\n\n\f700\n\naverage norm\n\nconvective term\npressure gradient term\n600\nelastic term\nviscous term\n500\n\nWic1\n\nWic2\n\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nWeissenberg number Wi\n\nmaximum speed of separation vortex\n\nFigure 11: (Color online) Absolute-value norms of the convective term kRe(u * \u2207)uk, the pressure\ngradient term k\u2207pk, the elastic term k\u2207 * \u03c4 k, and the viscous term k\u03b2\u22072 uk in the Navier-Stokes\nequation as a function of Wi at Re = 200.\n\n1.2\u00d710\n\n-2\n\n1.0\u00d710\n\n-2\n\n8.0\u00d710\n\n-3\n\n6.0\u00d710\n\n-3\n\n4.0\u00d710\n\n-3\n\n2.0\u00d710\n\n-3\n\n0.0\u00d710\n\nRe=100\nRe=200\n\nRe=100 Re=200\nWic1\nWic1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n6\n\nWeissenberg Number Wi\n\nFigure 12: (Color online) Maximum speed of flows in the separation vortex as a function of Wi at\nRe = 100 and 200.

The characteristic regions and patterns used in the description at Sec. 4.3 are superposed.\n\n19\n\n\f4.3.1\n\nConvective region\n\nIn the convective region, the separation vortex emerges in the outward region (a) (see Fig. 3(a)). This\nis a characteristic phenomenon of Newtonian fluid flows in wavy-walled channels [20].\nThe generation mechanism of the separation vortex is as follows. The norms of the convective and\npressure-gradient terms almost accord in the convective region as shown in Fig. 11, while the elastic and\nviscous terms are much less than the convective and pressure-gradient terms. This accordance indicates\nthat the pressure gradient and the centrifugal force cancel in the whole domain in steady flows. The\ncentrifugal force is very large particularly in the inward region (b) where the streamwise velocity and\nthe curvature are large. The large centrifugal force leads to the large centripetal pressure gradient in\nthe inward region (b). Then, the pressure becomes smaller in the inward region (b) than in the outward\nregion (a) (see Fig. 13(a)). Because the pressure gradient inhibits the flows from the contraction region\n(f) to the outward region (a), the bulk flow then passes near the inward region (b). The separation\nvortex detached from the bulk flow finally emerges in the outward region (a) (see Fig. 3(a)).\nIn the convective region, the characteristic phenomenon of viscoelastic fluid flows is observed as\na jet flow near the bottom wall as shown in Figs. 5(a), 6(a), and 7(a). The generation mechanism\nof the jet flow is described as follows. The bulk shear flow through the inward region (b) strongly\nstretches polymers near the bottom wall. The polymer stretching leads to the increase of the elastic\nstress and to that of the streamwise elastic force in this region (see Fig. 14(a)). Because the augmented\nstreamwise elastic force increases a streamwise flow, the jet flow finally emerges in the inward region (b)\n(see 0.5 < y < 0.7 in the curves [a]-[c] in Fig. 5(a)).\nThe jet flow causes the viscous drag enhancement in the convective region as described at Sec. 4.2.1\nin the following way. Due to the jet flow, the wall-normal velocity gradient is inverted near the bottom\nwall. The elastic force near the bottom wall gradually increases with Wi (see Fig. 10). Then, the velocity\nof the jet flow is also augmented due to the intensified elastic force as shown in the curves [a] and [b]\nin Fig. 5(a). Because the increase of the velocity leads to that of the velocity gradient, the viscous wall\nfriction also grows on the bottom wall as shown in Fig. 8. The increase of the flow velocity due to the\nstreamwise elastic force near the bottom wall also directly leads to the growth of the flow rate as shown\nin Fig. 9.\nWith further increasing Wi, the flow behavior described above is moderately modified. The representative modification is the growth of the elastic stress in the contraction regions (c) and (f) (see Fig.\n14(b)). In the contraction regions (c) and (f), the channel is narrower than in the highly-curved regions\nincluding the outward regions (a), (e), the inward regions (b), and (d) (see Fig. 1(a)). The flow velocity\nis basically large in the narrow regions (c) and (f) because the flow rate, which is the integral of the\nflow velocity in the wall-normal section of the channel, is constant in the every wall-normal section.\nThe difference between the velocities in the contraction region and in the highly-curved region stretches\npolymers between the two regions. The augmented elastic stress forms the lumps of large-stress regions\nin the contraction regions (c) and (f) (see Fig. 14(b)). The lump in the contraction region (c) gradually\nextends to the outward regions (a) and (e) with Wi and the lump in the contraction region (f) gradually\nreaches to the inward region (b) (see Fig. 14(b)). Because the lump of the elastic stress induces flows\nfrom the outward region (a) to the contraction region (c) due to the tangential gradient of the elastic\nstress (see the definition of the tangential direction in Fig. 1(a)), the separation vortex in the outward\nregion (a) gradually becomes small with Wi (see the curves [b] and [c] in Fig. 5(b)). Since the large-stress\nregion extended from the contraction region (f) to the inward region (b) increases flows above the jet\nflow in the inward region (b), the jet flow is relatively depressed (see 0.5 < y < 0.7 in the curves [b] and\n[c] in Fig. 5(a)). The depression of the jet flow directly leads to the decrease of the viscous wall friction\non the bottom wall at Wi > 4.0 as shown in Fig. 8.\nThe description at this subsection is summarized as follows (see also Fig. 15(a)). The separation\nvortex in the outward region (a) and the jet flow in the inward region (b) are the characteristic flow\npatterns of the steady solutions in the convective region. The separation vortex is caused by the local\nforces which also works in the Newtonian fluid flows, whereas the jet flow stems from the elastic force\ncharacteristic of viscoelastic fluid flows.\n\n20\n\n\f4.3.2\n\nTransition region\n\nAs described at the previous subsection, the flow from the outward region (a) to the contraction region\n(c) gradually increases with Wi due to an streamwise elastic force. The increased flow further augments\nthe elastic stress in the contraction region (c) because the increased velocity and velocity gradient further\nstretch polymers. The augmented elastic stress repeatedly increases the flow from the outward region\n(a) to the contraction region (c). This argument indicates that the flow and the streamwise elastic force\nis self-enhanced in this region.\nWhen Wi attains the first critical Weissenberg number Wic1 , this self-enhancing procedure actually\nsets in. Then, the elastic effect becomes suddenly comparable with the convective effect, and the flow\npattern observed in the convective region drastically changes.\nThe sudden formation of the jet flow in the outward region (a) and the sudden vanishment of the\njet flow in the inward region (b) are the prominent change of the flow pattern in the transition region\nas described at Sec. 4.1 (see 0.5 < y < 0.7 and 1.1 < y < 1.5 in the curves [c] and [d] in Fig. 5(a)).\nThe generation of the jet flow in the outward region (a) results from the increase of the velocity in the\noutward region (a) due to the streamwise elastic force described above. Then, the jet flow in the inward\nregion (b) is relatively depressed due to the increase of flows to the outward region (a). The vanishment\nof the jet flow in the inward region (b) leads to the abrupt reduction of the viscous drag on the bottom\nwall as shown in Fig. 8. Due to the emergence of the jet flow in the outward region (a), the separation\nvortex is vanished or becomes very small as shown in Fig. 3(b) and y > 1.4 in the curve [d] in Fig. 5(a).\nThe lump of the large-stress region in the contraction region (c) also suddenly grows beyond Wic1 .\nBecause the lump of the large-stress region attains to the walls (see Fig. 14(c)), the elastic wall friction\nsuddenly grows at Wic1 as shown in Fig. 10. Note that the lump of the elastic stress is inclined to the\nchannel walls. This is because the jet flow in the outward region (a) enhances the elastic stress near the\nupper wall (see Figs. 14(c)).\nThe flow rate for Wi > 4.0 varies with the decrease of the flow velocity in the inward region (b)\nand the increase of the flow velocity in the outward region (a). The flow pattern transition leads to the\nreduction of the flow rate as shown in Fig. 9. However, the flow rate remarkably increases above Wic1\nbecause the streamwise elastic force further increases the flow to the outward region (a) with Wi in the\ntransition region. The growth of the flow rate with Wi also appears in the amplitude of the jet flow as\nshown in the curves [d]-[f] in Fig. 5(a).\nIn the transition region, the jet flow in the outward region (a) gradually moves from the upper\nwall to the bottom wall (see the curves [d]-[f] in Fig. 5(a)). The mechanism of the moving jet flow is\ndescribed as follows. The hoop stress induces the elastic force working to the centripetal direction in\ncurved streamlines. Due to the centripetal elastic force in the outward region (a), flows normal to the\nstreamwise direction are induced. Because of the flow normal to the streamwise direction, the lump\nof the large-stress region in the contraction region (c) falls down to the bottom wall (see Fig. 14(d)).\nThe descended lump of the large-stress region repeatedly induces the jet flow due to the streamwise\nelastic force in the lower position of the channel (see Fig. 14(d) and the curve [e] in Fig. 5(a)). Because\nthe jet flow augments the elastic stress between the outward region (b) and the inward region (a), the\nlarge-stress belt-like region is finally formed from the region between the outward region (b) and the\ninward region (a) to the inward region (d) (see Fig. 14(d)). The hoop stress strongly works in this region\ndue to the large elastic stress and the large flow curvature. Then, the flow normal to the streamwise\ndirection is further induced. Thus, the jet flow gradually reaches to the bottom wall. With the variation\nof the position of the jet flow, the separation vortex repeatedly emerges and gradually grows (see the\ncurves [d]-[f] in Fig. 5(b)).\nThe influence of the elastic stress on the flow is confirmed through the comparison of the elastic force\nwith the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient in the following way (see also Fig. 15(b)). First, the\nhoop stress in the outward region (a) described above is canceled by the centrifugal pressure gradient\nin the steady flows because the centrifugal force is very small due to the small velocity near the upper\nwall. The pressure distribution shown in Fig. 13(b) indeed indicates the centrifugal pressure gradient\nin the outward region (a). Second, in the inward region (b), the sum of the centripetal elastic force and\npressure gradient cancels the centrifugal force in the steady flows because the convective term, the origin\n21\n\n\fof the centrifugal force, is yet larger than the elastic and pressure gradient terms at relatively small Wi\nin the transition region as shown in Fig. 11. Since the centrifugal force does not almost depends on Wi\n(see Fig. 11), the growth of the elastic force directly leads to the decrease of the pressure gradient in\nthe inward region (b) (see Figs. 13(a) and (b)). The reduction of the pressure gradient in the inward\nregion (b) is also consistent with the decrease of the flow to the inward region (b).\nThe description at this subsection is summarized as follows (see also Fig. 15(b)). The sudden\nvanishment of the jet flow in the inward region (b) and the abrupt formation of the jet flow in the\noutward region (a) due to the streamwise elastic force simultaneously occurs at the beginning of the\ntransition region. The jet flow gradually reaches from the upper wall to the bottom wall due to the\nelastic hoop stress in the transition region.\n4.3.3\n\nElastic region\n\nThe jet flow approaching to the bottom wall stops approximately above the second critical Weissenberg\nnumber. In the elastic region, the jet flow near the bottom wall and the separation vortex in the outward\nregion (a) characterizes the flow patterns as in the convective region (see Figs. 3(a) and (c)),\nDespite the similarity of the flow patterns between the convective and elastic regions, the generation\nmechanism of the separation vortex and the jet flow is remarkably different in the two regions. In the\nelastic region, the large-stress belt-like region described at the previous subsection covers wide regions\nincluding the inward regions (b), (d) , the contraction regions (c), and (f) in the channel due to the large\nelastic hoop stress at large Wi (see Fig. 14(e)). Because the convective term does not vary with Wi as\ndescribed above, the pressure gradient term grows with the elastic stress in the steady flows in order to\ncancel the elastic term. The large-pressure region thus also spreads into the wide regions of the domain\n(see Fig. 13(c)). Then, the flow from the outward region (a) to the contraction region (c) is severely\ninhibited by the large pressure gradient from the contraction region (c) to the outward region (a). Since\nthe bulk flow cannot pass through the outward region (a), the separation vortex is stably maintained in\nthe outward region (a). Note that the separation vortex appears in the low-pressure region in the elastic\nregion unlike the separation vortex observed in the high-pressure region in the convective region (see\nFigs. 3(a),(c), Figs. 13(a), and (c)). The vortex emergence in the low-pressure region is a characteristic\nphenomenon of viscoelastic fluid flows.\nThe difference of flows between the convective and elastic regions also arises in the viscous wall\nfriction and the flow rate (see Figs. 8 and 9). In the elastic region, the flow is basically developed in\nthe inward regions due to the large elastic hoop stress. The larger streamwise elastic force at larger Wi\ncauses the larger velocity of the jet flow and the larger velocity gradient in the inward region (b) (see\nFig. 5(c)). The variation of the velocity gradient directly leads to the viscous drag enhancement with\nWi in the elastic region as shown in Fig. 8. Because the velocity gradient in the inward region (b) in the\nelastic region is much smaller than that in the convective region, the magnitude of the viscous drag in\nthe elastic region is also much smaller than that in the convective region (see the curves [a]-[c] and [f] in\nFig. 5(a)). The flow rates in the convective and elastic regions are also different because the magnitudes\nof the elastic stress in the two regions are remarkably different (see Figs. 14(a) and (e)). However, the\ngrowth rate of the flow rate is relaxed with Wi in the elastic region. This is because the elastic stress is\nalso relaxed for sufficiently large Wi in the elastic region as shown in Fig. 10.\nTo summarize, the separation vortex in the low-pressure region and the jet flow in the inward regions\n(b) emerge due to the large elastic hoop stress and the streamwise elastic force in the elastic region (see\nalso Fig. 15(c)).\nWe have described the mechanism of the flow pattern transition, the variation of the wall frictions,\nand that of the flow rate in the three regions. These arguments show that the streamwise elastic force\nproduces jet flows which characterize the flow pattern formation in wavy-walled channel shear flows.\n\n4.4\n\nScaling analysis on the elastic wall friction\n\nHow is the relationship between the flow pattern transition and the change of the local force balance\ntheoretically confirmed?

The curve of Wic1\nThe values\nis fitted by using a power function F1 (Re) = A1 (Re \u2212 Rec )A2 + A3 , where Rec is fixed to 70. \u221a\nof the fitting parameters are A1 \u223c 0.06, A2 \u223c 0.5, and A3 \u223c 4.5. The relationship Wic1 \u221d Re \u2212 Rec\nis nearly satisfied. Rec = 70 is a reasonable value because the sudden growth of the elastic wall friction\ndoes not occur when Re < Rec . Moreover the size of the separation vortex in the convective region is\nabruptly decreased when Re < Rec . Although we draw a line from Re = 70 to Re = 0 in a low Wi and\nlow Re region in Fig. 2, the Reynolds number below which the separation vortex completely disappears\nin the Newtonian limit Wi \u2192 0 is maybe larger than zero.\nThe norms of the convective term kRe(u * \u2207)uk and the elastic term |\u2207 * \u03c4 | have similar values at\nWic1 as shown in Fig. 11. When the non-dimensional velocity and the derivatives are scaled to O(1),\nthe following relationship is derived:\n\u03c4 \u221d Re.\n(20)\nFigure 17 shows the elastic wall friction \u03c4ewf at Wic1 as a function of Re.

The linear relationship\n(20) between \u03c4 and Re is indeed approximately satisfied. The two relationships \u03c4 \u221d Re \u2212 Rec and\nWic1 \u221d Re \u2212 Rec lead to the relationship of the elastic stress and Wic1 as \u03c4 \u221d Wic1 2 .\n\n4.5\n\npurely elastic limit\n\nIn this subsection, we show the results of purely elastic calculations at Re = 0. Recent years, purely\nelastic flows have been intensively studied in the context of elastic instability and elastic turbulence\n[13, 10, 3, 18]. The elastic force mainly drives flows in the purely elastic limit because the convective\nterm is vanished.\nFigure 18 shows streamlines of the steady solutions at the low Weissenberg number Wi = 1.0 and\nthe moderate Weissenberg number Wi = 6.0 with Re = 0. The separation vortex is not observed at\nlow Wi. The disappearance of the separation vortex results from the vanishment of the convective\nterm. When the convective term is vanished, the centrifugal force does not work in the whole domain.\nBecause the centrifugal force is canceled by the pressure gradient for low Wi as described at Sec. 4.3.1,\nthe pressure gradient is also remarkably weakened in the whole domain.

The flows at Re = 0\nare similar to those at moderate Re for large Wi as shown in Figs. 3(c) and 18(b). This is because the\nelastic force and the pressure gradient are dominant for large Wi at every Re.\nFigure 19 shows the elastic wall friction as a function of Wi. The sudden growth of the elastic wall\nfriction is not observed because the flow pattern transition between the convective and transition regions\ndoes not occur. However, the growth rates of the elastic wall frictions at the low- and high- Wi regions\nare much different. The Weissenberg number at which the growth rate changes nearly corresponds to\nthe Weissenberg number at which the separation vortex emerges.\n\n4.6\n\nPoiseuille-type flows\n\nIn this subsection, we show the steady solutions of Poiseuille-type flows driven by a body force in order\nto elucidate the dependence of the flow pattern transition on driving forces.\nWe add a constant body force (constant pressure gradient) only in the rectangular regions connecting\nthe inflow and outflow boundaries. No body force is added in the two outward regions (a) and (e) (see\nFigs. 1(a) and 20). The wall amplitude A needs to be less than the half width of the channel A = 0.5\nin this method. We adopt A = 0.3 in the Poiseuille-type flow cases instead of A = 0.5 used in the\nCouette-type flow cases. The magnitude of the body force is determined under the condition that the\nflow rate F R is fixed at every Wi.\nFigure 21 shows streamlines of the steady solutions of the Poiseuille-type flows at Re = 200. The two\nseparation vortices appear in the outward regions (a) and (e) at the low Weissenberg number Wi = 1.0.\nThese separation vortices disappear at the moderate Weissenberg number Wi = 6.0, but reappear at\nthe high Weissenberg number Wi = 30.0. This shows that the flow pattern transition is not influenced\nby the difference of the driving forces between the Couette-type and Poiseuille-type flows.\nNext, we confirm the relationship between the flow pattern transition and the variation of the elastic\nwall friction in the Poiseuille-type flows. In Fig. 22, we show the elastic wall friction as a function of\nWi. When the separation vortices disappear, the growth rate of the elastic wall friction suddenly varies\nat Wi = 6.0. This result is also qualitatively consistent with that of the Couette-type flows.\n\n24\n\n\f1.5\n\n(b)\n\nWi=1.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\ny\n\n1\n\n0\n\nWi=6.0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nx\n\nFigure 18: (Color online) Streamlines of the steady solutions at the small Weissenberg number Wi = 1.0\nand the large Weissenberg number Wi = 6.0 with Re = 0.\n\n25\n\nelastic wall friction \u03c4ewf\n\ny\n\n(a)\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\nWeissenberg number Wi\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 19: (Color online) Elastic wall friction \u03c4ewf as a function of Wi at Re = 0.\n\n25\n\n\fFigure 20: (Color online) Regions in which a constant body force is imposed in Poiseuille-type flow\ncases.\nAlthough the Poiseuille-type and Couette-type flows are qualitatively similar, the Weissenberg numbers at which the separation vortices disappear or emerge are much different between the two flows. The\ndifference may result from that of the relationship between the centrifugal force and the elastic force. In\nPoiseuille-type flows, the centrifugal force is larger in a bulk region than near walls and the elastic force\nis larger near walls than in the bulk region. In contrast, the centrifugal force is larger near the bottom\nwall than in a bulk region and the elastic force is large in the inward regions (b), (d), in the contraction\nregions (c), and (f) in Couette-type flows.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and Concluding remarks\n\nIn this study, we seek base steady solutions of the curvilinear shear flows in the wavy-walled channel.\nHowever, the transient behavior of the relaxation process to the steady solutions is also important when\nwe consider the relation of the base solutions to elastic instability. In this section, we first discuss the\ntransient behavior using relaxation times against small perturbations on the base steady solutions and\nnext summarize our study.\nIn Fig. 23, we show the relaxation processes of the velocity component ux against small random\nperturbations on the conformation tensor of the base steady solutions in the convective region Wi = 2.0,\nthe transition region Wi = 5.2, and the elastic region Wi = 8.0 at Re = 200. The same perturbation is\nadded to the three steady solutions. The time is normalized with Wi which represents the relaxation time\nof the conformation tensor (see Eqs. (3) and (7)). This figure shows that the perturbation more rapidly\nrelaxes in the convective and elastic regions than in the transition region. Note that the perturbation\namplitude of the velocity is the largest in the transition region despite the same amplitude of the stress\nperturbations. The large velocity perturbations shows that the feedback from the elastic stress to the\nvelocity is the largest in the transition region. We expect that the pressure gradient plays a key role\nin the difference of the relaxation processes between the three regions. In the convective and elastic\nregions, the pressure gradient nearly accords with the centrifugal force and the elastic force, respectively.\nIn contrast, the pressure gradient in the transition region relatively decreases compared with the other\nregions (see Fig. 11). The pressure reduction and the long relaxation time in the transition region may\nindicate that the pressure gradient works to depress the perturbation of the extra-stress in our flow\nsystem.

The oscillatory nature in the high-Wi region is also observed\nin the earlier two-dimensional calculations of viscoelastic extensional flows [18].\nIn order to sustain the disturbance against the relaxation due to the pressure gradient, several methods can be considered. First, utilizing three-dimensional curved channels may lead to elastic instability\nbecause the pressure hardly suppress spanwise secondary flows for the lack of the degree of freedom.\nSpanwise secondary flows, for example G\u00f6rtler vortices, are actually observed in three-dimensional\ncurved-wall flows [43]. A second normal stress difference in three-dimensional systems also influences\nflow behavior of curvilinear flows of viscoelastic fluids [42] though it can work as both stabilizing and\ndestabilizing effects [44]. Second, subcritical instabilities may occur against well-selected finite-amplitude\nperturbations in wavy-walled channels as in the earlier studies of plane-Poiseuille flows [32, 45]. The\nwell-selected initial conditions are generally produced using the most unstable modes derived in linear\nstability analyses [46]. The initial conditions probably have the self-enhancing characteristic that the\nelastic effects store energy in high shear regions and dump it in less sheard regions in order to sustain\nperturbations [45].\nFinally, we summarize our study. We have numerically investigated laminar steady flows of viscoelastic fluids in canonical wavy-walled channels at moderate Re and Wi with spectral element method. The\nsteady solutions of laminar flows are classified into three groups. The three groups correspond to three\nregions in the Re-Wi parameter space. The steady solutions in the three regions have remarkably different flow patterns characterized by jet flows near the walls and the vortex detached from a bulk flow\ncalled separation vortex. The separation vortex and the jet flow near the bottom wall emerge at low Wi.\nThe vortex is temporarily vanished or becomes very small at moderate Wi, while the vortex reappears\nat large Wi. The jet flow near the bottom wall disappears and another jet flow appears near the upper\nwall at moderate Wi, while the jet flow near the upper wall gradually reaches to the bottom wall with\nWi. The separation vortex has been observed in numerical simulations and experiments of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid flows in wavy-walled channels [20, 41]. The results we have obtained\nare consistent with those of the earlier studies in the point that both the convective and elastic terms\ninfluence on the flow pattern formation [47].\nWhen the flow pattern changes, the viscous wall friction drastically decreases. The drag reduction of\nlaminar flows also occurs in experiments and numerical simulations of viscoelastic fluids in curved pipes\n[42, 48]. The flow pattern transition also accompanies the sudden growth of the elastic wall friction.\nThe sudden growth of the elastic wall friction is caused by the influence of the elastic stress augmented\nin the bulk flow on the walls. The growth mechanism of the elastic wall friction has similarity with that\n28\n\n\f(a)\n\n-1.4\u00d710-3\n\n(b)\n\nWi=2.0\n\n-1.5\u00d710-3\n\nWi=5.2\n\n4.20\u00d710-3\n\nvelocity ux\n\n-1.6\u00d710-3\n-1.7\u00d710-3\n-1.8\u00d710-3\n\n4.15\u00d710-3\n4.10\u00d710-3\n4.05\u00d710-3\n\n-1.9\u00d710-3\n-2.0\u00d710-3\n\n4.00\u00d710-3\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\nnormalized time \u03a4\n\n(c)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-1.85\u00d710-3\n\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\nnormalized time \u03a4\n\nWi=8.0\n\n-3\n\n-1.86\u00d710\n\n-1.87\u00d710-3\n\n(c)\n\n-3\n\n-1.849\u00d710\n\nvelocity ux\n\nvelocity ux\n\n4.25\u00d710-3\n\n-3\n\n-1.88\u00d710\n\n-1.89\u00d710-3\n-1.90\u00d710-3\n-1.91\u00d710-3\n\n-3\n\n-1.882\u00d710\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-1.92\u00d710-3\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\nnormalized time \u03a4\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 23: (Color online) Relaxation processes of the velocity component ux against small random\nperturbations in (a) the convective region Wi = 2.0, (b) the transition region Wi = 5.2, and (c) the\nelastic region Wi = 8.0.

The similarity\nbetween laminar non-Newtonian fluid flows and Newtonian turbulent flows has been long pointed out\n[49]. The similarity has been also interested in the recent studies in the context of elastic turbulence\n[12, 17].\nWe qualitatively described the mechanism of the flow pattern transition by utilizing the local force\nrelation among the centrifugal force, the elastic force, and the pressure gradient on the basis of the\nvariation of the terms in the momentum equation. Through the all regions, the streamwise elastic force\nas well as the hoop stress is the origin of the flow pattern formations. When a convective effect and an\nelastic effect balance, the abrupt pattern transition occurs.\nBy the scaling analysis, we shown that the stress component is proportional to the Reynolds number\non the boundary of the first transition in the Re-Wi space. This scaling coincides well with the numerical\nresult. The critical Reynolds number Rec \u223c 70 obtained in the scaling analysis is reasonable as a\ncharacteristic value at which an inertial effect becomes considerable [13].\nWe perform the computations of purely elastic flows at Re = 0. Due to the vanishment of the\ncentrifugal force, the separation vortex disappears at low Wi. The separation vortex emerges at moderate\nWi as in the case of the moderate-Re calculations. The vortex vanishment at low Re has been indeed\nobserved in the computations of Newtonian fluid flows [20]. Note that the Weissenberg number at which\nthe separation vortex emerges is close to the Weissenberg number at which elastic turbulence starts in the\nexperiments of viscoelastic fluid flows for very small Reynolds number Re \u226a 1 in curved-wall channels\n[12]. The modulation of the separation vortex may be related to elastic instability as observed in the\nearlier experiments [41].\nWe finally perform the computations of Poiseuille-type flows driven by a constant body force. The\ntransition of the flow pattern and the growth rate of the elastic wall friction are also observed in the\nPoiseuille-type flows as in the Couette-type flows.\nIn the future work, we plan to perform nonlinear stability analyses by utilizing the steady solutions\nwhich we have obtained in this study in order to investigate a detailed bifurcation diagram in twodimensional wavy-walled channels. In addition, we will employ the three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations to confirm elastic instabilities in the three-dimensional viscoelastic wavy-walled systems.\nAcknowledgement: We gratefully acknowledge Sadayoshi Toh for essential discussions.
