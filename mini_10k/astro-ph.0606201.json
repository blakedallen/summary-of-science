The bar/bulge components (bulge, or\nbar, or bulge + bar) are perhaps the most difficult to disentangle from other components\nbecause of extinction and our perspective of them due to our position in the Galactic plane\n(Zhao 2000); they have been the topic of recent controversy concerning their morphology (e.g.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nSevenster et al. 1999; Garz\u00f3n 1999; Merrifield 2004, and references therein). Our hypothesis\nin this debate has been that there are indeed two components (Hammersley et al. 2001): a\nbar which is long and in the plane (\u221214\u25e6 < l < +30\u25e6 , |b| <\u2248 1.5\u25e6 ), and a triaxial bulge,\nwhich is short and much wider in latitude (observable at |l| <\u2248 15\u25e6 , |b| <\u2248 10\u25e6 ). Their\nposition angles (angle between the major axis and the solar vector radius) might not be\ncoincident, although the latest measurements give values that do not differ greatly: 43\u25e6 \u00b1 7\u25e6\nfor the long bar (Hammersley et al. 2000; hereafter H00); and 28\u25e6 \u00b1 \u223c 8\u25e6 (syst.) for the\ntriaxial bulge (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2005).\nThe story of the Galactic bar really begins with the discovery of large non-circular\nvelocities in the 3 kpc and 135 km/s spiral arms (Rougoor & Oort 1960; Rougoor 1964). De\nVaucouleurs (1964) was the first to attempt to explain the motions of these arms in terms\nof a non-axisymmetric potential (a bar) at the centre of the Galaxy. He later predicted\nthat the Milky Way was of type SAB(rs)bc on the grounds of the Galaxy's high spiral arm\nmultiplicity, broken ring structure and non-circular H i motions (de Vaucouleurs 1970). The\nnon-axisymmetry hypothesis, or \"field model\", was not well received at the time by the\nastronomical community, which favoured Oort's (1977) \"ejection model\", advocating the\nexpulsion of gas from the centre of the Galaxy, even though it would require energies of the\norder 1055 erg to power such an expansion of the spiral arms (van der Kruit 1971). Kerr\n(1967), however, explained the 3 kpc and 135 km/s arms in terms of a bar. Peters (1975)\nmodelled the H i distribution derived from l\u2013v diagrams in the inner 4 kpc of the Galaxy in\nterms of concentric elliptical orbits. He found that an orientation of 45 deg w.r.t. to the solar\nradius vector fitted the maximum number of radio features in the l\u2013v diagrams, including\nthe 3 kpc and 135 km/s arms. With regard to molecular gas, Nakai (1992) compared CO\n(J = 1 \u2192 0) emission maps of the barred spiral galaxies Maffei 2, NGC 2903 and NGC\n253 with that of the Milky Way Galaxy (derived from the CO radial velocity at a sample\nof galactic longitudes). All four galaxies show a similar radial CO distribution with a sharp\ncentral peak and a secondary hump (corresponding to the bar\u2013spiral arm transition). The\nradio evidence, then, gave strong indications of: a) a non-axisymmetric distribution of gas\norbits and b) a CO intensity distribution that corresponded with other barred galaxies.\nOur hypothesis concerning the existence of a long bar originate from near-infrared Two\nMicron Galactic Survey data (TMGS, Garz\u00f3n et al. 1993). It began with an analysis of Kband TMGS star counts that led Hammersley et al. (1994) to posit the existence of a bar of\nradius 4 kpc, with one of the tips at l = 27\u25e6 , and the other one at l = \u221222\u25e6 , which would give\nan angle of 75 degrees 1 . Calbet et al. (1995) presented \"tomographs\" of the Galactic plane\n1\n\nThis was later retracted by H00, who realized that the negative tip is in fact at l \u2248 \u221212\u25e6 , so that the\nangle of the bar is instead \u2248 43\u25e6 .\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(derived from TMGS star counts and using the rather inaccurate assumption of a Dirac delta\nluminosity function, which could serve as a zeroth order approximation of the structure of\nthe Galaxy), and the long bar was evident (figure 14 of Calbet et al. 1995), extending over\na radius larger than 3\u20133.5 kpc, although the method was not accurate enough to provide\ninformation about its morphology. Calbet et al. (1996) also proposed the existence of a dust\nlane preceding the bar at negative longitudes, which would explain the higher extinction\nobserved in this region. Considerable progress was made by H00, who measured the distance\nof several points along the bar, including l = 27\u25e6 , and, using a technique of analysis of\nred-clump stars in near-infrared colour\u2013magnitude diagram, concluded that the angle was\n43\u25e6 \u00b17\u25e6 . The same analysis with the same data, only using near-infrared filters, was presented\nby Picaud et al. (2003), who also compared the data with the Besan\u00e7on model (Robin et\nal. 2003), and they obtained a similar result (45\u25e6 \u00b1 9\u25e6 ). Other papers of our team (Garz\u00f3n\net al. 1997; L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 1999, 2001b) have produced further evidence, as will be\ndescribed in Section 2.\nConcerning the stellar populations, Ng (1998) finds two populations towards the Galactic\nCentre: an old metal rich population (Z = 0.005\u20130.08, t = 13\u201315 Gyr), presumably the old\nGalactic bulge, and a younger less metal-rich population (Z = 0.003\u20130.03, t = 8\u20139 Gyr),\nperhaps the long bar. Cole & Weinberg (2002) also showed a non-axisymmetric structure\nthat is likely to have been formed more recently than 3 Gyr ago and must be younger than 6\nGyr. However, they are at |b| > 2\u25e6 so they were possibly measuring the suburbs of the long\nbar, some anomalously young population in the bulge, or some contamination of the disc.\nIt is supposed that bars form as the result of an instability in differentially rotating\ndiscs (Sellwood 1981) whereas bulges are a primordial galactic component, so this distinction\nmakes sense and it is not merely an artefact invented to fit certain morphological features.\nAthanassoula & Misiriotis (2002), Athanassoula (2005) and Athanassoula & Beaton (2006)\nuse N-body simulations to produce long bars, which are broadened in at their centres into\nboxy bulges (the ratio of sizes between the semi-axis of the long bar and the major axis\nof the boxy bulge is approximately 1.5). Boxy bulges are in fact just a part of the long\nbar (Athanassoula 2005). From a comparison of their N-body simulations and near-infrared\nphotometry Athanassoula & Beaton (2006) argue that the boxy bulge of M31 extends into\na long bar. There is a striking parallel with our own Galaxy, which also has a boxy bulge\n(Picaud & Robin 2004; L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2005) that extends into the long bar described\nin this and previous papers. Bars might be vertically extended (Kuijken 1996) but they might\nbe constrained to the plane too. Indeed, many other galaxies exhibit both a bar and a bulge;\ne.g. NGC 3351, NGC 1433 and NGC 3992, whose images in the Palomar plates, for instance,\nshow the existence of both structures.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nNevertheless, many authors (reviewed by Merrifield 2004) have for many years ignored\nthe bar + bulge hypothesis and preferred to speak about a unique non-axisymmetric structure, namely a bar (i.e. bulge) that is triaxial, short and fatter (what we call this component\nthe bulge). These authors did not consider the possibility of a long bar constrained in the\nGalactic plane. Although they were more or less successful in fitting the stars in off-plane\nregions, the abundance of new data now indicates that some new component in the Galactic\nplane at longitudes +15\u25e6 < l < +30\u25e6 is being observed that is unexplainable in terms of a\ndisc + bulge + extinction model. This fact will be corroborated in \u00a72 with All-Sky 2MASS\nand MSX data. In addition, in \u00a73 we use red clump star data from the recent literature\n(including new observations of our own: Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2006b) to reinforce the old\npicture of our hypothesis that there is a long bar apart from the bulge. Furthermore, the\nposition angle obtained in the past is confirmed by the latest data (Benjamin et al. 2005).\n\n2.\n\nThe asymmetry in the counts\n\nL\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b) used star counts and extinction maps of negative latitudes and confirmed the general picture of a long bar: higher counts in the positive than\nin negative longitudes (for |l| < 30\u25e6 and strictly in the plane b <\u2248 1.5\u25e6 ). This north/south\nasymmetry was confirmed with recenter GLIMPSE data by Benjamin et al. (2005), with\n25% more sources in the north, although they do not include the region |l| < 10\u25e6 . L\u00f3pezCorredoira et al. (2001b) also show a higher extinction on average iat negative latitudes.\nBabusiaux & Gilmore (2005) say, however, that they see no asymmetry in the extinction, but\nwe think they have only four points to measure the asymmetry, and one of them (l \u2248 \u221210\u25e6 )\nhas a minimum according to L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b, Fig. 8). When the star counts\nare statistically corrected for extinction by using the colours, a clean image of the negative\nlatitudes of the Galaxy is obtained (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2001b, fig. 10) that clearly\nshows the in-plane bar extending up to l \u2248 \u221213\u25e6 , as expected by H00. The schematic representation in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b, fig. 3) summarizes the model. Unavane &\nGilmore (1998) and Alard (2001) also explored asymmetries in star counts in the plane but\nonly for |l| <\u2248 4\u25e6 .\nWith the data of 2MASS All-Sky data release (Skrutskie et al. 2006) in the K band, we\nplot the star counts up to mK = 9 in Fig. 1, and show a clear asymmetry. We corroborate\nthe results by L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b), who used DENIS and TMGS data for some\nregions (not all-sky) to claim that a long bar must be present, and that this structure is\nbeyond the bulge region (|l| < 15\u25e6 ), extending to nearly l = 30\u25e6 in positive longitudes.\nWith MSX mid-infrared data (Egan et al. 1999) we also see the same trend. Figure\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3 clearly shows the excess at positive galactic longitudes; it also shows a deficit between\nl = \u221215\u25e6 and l = \u221218\u25e6 , which indicates that the bar at negative latitudes finishes at\nl \u2248 \u221214\u25e6 (the feature at l = \u221222\u25e6 is thought to be the 3 kpc ring; L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al.\n2001b).\nGarz\u00f3n et al. (1997) and L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (1999) confirmed spectroscopically\nthat most of the brightest K-band stars at l = 27\u25e6 in the plane are supergiants, thereby\nreinforcing the argument that this region contains a prominent star formation region possibly\nassociated with the end of the bar where it meets the Scutum spiral arm.\nFreundenreich (1998) realized that there are significant residuals in the plane over |l| <\n30 after subtracting the disc and the bulge in COBE/DIRBE data; however, he prefers to\nattribute these residuals to patchy star formation in a ring or spiral arms. Picaud (2004) also\nsays that this star formation region might be associated with some other structure such as a\nring. However, as plotted in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b, fig. 6), a ring would produce a\nshape in the distribution of star counts different from that shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the\ndeficit of stars observed between l = \u221215\u25e6 and l = \u221218\u25e6 in Fig. 3 indicates the absence of\nany possible continuous structure between l = 0 and l = \u221222\u25e6 ; a ring should be continous,\nwhereas our bar finishes at l = \u221214\u25e6 . The bar fits the star counts perfectly, whereas the\nring does not. A spiral arm solution on the far side of the Galaxy (at distance 10\u201312 kpc)\nor closer than the central region of the Galaxy (distances less than 5 kpc) is also discarded\nbecause of the arguments given by Hammersley et al. (1994) and because, as will be shown\nin \u00a73, the distance of this structure does not fit any ring or spiral arm possibility.\n\u25e6\n\nExtinction is also discarded by Hammersley et al. (1994) and L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al.\n(2001b). Furthermore, a closer examination of extinction-corrected counts, for instance\nthat in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira (2005, fig. 1), shows a still higher number of counts at positive\nlongitudes. In Fig. 2 we show an example from the data of L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2005)\nwith me < 7.0. GLIMPSE (Benjamin et al. 2005) and MSX mid-infrared data (Fig. 3) also\nshow the asymmetry and are much less affected by extinction.\n\n3.\n\nThe red clump as a distance indicator\n\nThe red clump method is well known and explained in several papers (e.g. Stanek et\nal. 1997; H00; L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2002): in a colour\u2013magnitude diagram, the maximum\nof the density of the red clump stars is identified with the major axis of the bar along each\nline of sight. This is not strictly true; it is a good approximation only when the bar is thin,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthat is, a very elongated structure, a long bar rather than a thick bulge. In our case, the\nbar is thin because there is a dispersion of \u03c3 \u2248 0.5\u20130.6 mag for the red clump, including\nthe intrinsic broadening of the red clump itself and the dispersion of distances (Fig. 4). In\na thick bulge, the maximum density in the line of sight is at the tangential point of the line\nof sight with the ellipsoids and may differ from the major axis position by \u223c1 kpc, but the\ndifference is only \u223c50 pc for the thin bar (appendix A). Also, there is a difference between\nthe maximum density along the line of sight and the maximum of the star counts of the red\nclump vs. the apparent magnitude, which is again negligible for thin bars (25\u201350 pc) and\nsomewhat more important for the thick bulge (100\u2013300 pc) (appendix B). Some authors,\ne.g. Babusiaux & Gilmore (2005), have not considered these effects and applied the method\nto fit the major axis of a thick-bulge structure, which is very inaccurate.\nBy gathering the different data in the literature2 with measurements of the distance as\nfunction of galactic longitude in the Galactic plane (constrained to |b| <\u2248 1\u25e6 ), we get Fig.\n5, which includes data from:\n\u2022 H00: Datum at b = 0, l = 27\u25e6 at a distance of 5.7 kpc. Other data might perhaps be\nderived from their colour\u2013magnitude diagrams but, as explained in Cabrera-Lavers et\nal. (2006b), the crowded regions in the plane limit the validity of the method.\n\u2022 Picaud et al. (2003). Data at b = 0. We take the given distances of 5.9 kpc at l = 26\u25e6\nand l = 27\u25e6 .\n\u2022 Nishiyama et al. (2005). These authors present many points between l = \u221210\u25e6 and\nl = +10\u25e6 , and we take one for each degree for our plot. Their data are for b = +1\u25e6 ,\nbut we assume they are at the same distance as the b = 0 data. They also use the\nred clump method and find that the position angle for |l| < 4\u25e6 is different from the\nposition angle derived with all the data |l| < 10\u25e6 . They attribute this to the existence\nof a new structure at |l| < 4\u25e6 but we believe that this could possibly be the effect of a\nsuperposition of a bulge and a long bar. In Fig. 5, we show how their data are roughly\ncompatible with a bar of position angle 40\u201345 degrees.\n\u2022 Babusiaux & Gilmore (2005). Data at b = 0 (except the point at l = 0, which is at\nb = +1\u25e6 ). A value of R\u2299 = 8 kpc is adopted. Babusiaux & Gilmore (2005) observed\nin the near infrared with the CIRSI survey in the plane fields at l = 0, \u00b15.7\u25e6 , \u00b19.7\u25e6 .\nThey calculate the distance of the red clumps for the bar for each of the five points.\n2\n\nRed clump distance data from Stanek et al. (1997) are not valid for our analysis because they are all\nmore than 2 degrees away from the plane.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nTheir results are that all the points except l = \u22129.7\u25e6 fit a bar with a position angle\nof 22.5\u25e6 . The field at l = \u22129.7\u25e6 is chosen to contain the presence of a stellar ring or\npseudo-ring at the end of the bar. The field at l = +5.7\u25e6 presents a wide dispersion of\ndistance owing perhaps to the added presence of distant (i.e. at the other side of the\nbar) disc red clump stars. We think that Babusiaux & Gilmore are observing the long\nbar and that the angle that their data give is possibly compatible with a position angle\nof around 40\u201345 degrees, as is shown in Fig. 5. However, they reject this hypothesis on\nthe grounds that, in their view, a bulge + bar would produce a spread in the red clump\ndistances; possible alternative explanations are that the bar might be predominant in\nthe plane, that the angle of bulge and bar might be very similar in the plane, or that\nthe spread real but low to separate both populations.\n\u2022 Benjamin et al. (2005). We calculate from their fig. 4, based on GLIMPSE data, the\nequivalent distances, assuming R\u2299 = 8 kpc instead of 8.5 kpc (which gives M[4.5] =\n\u22122.02 instead of \u22122.15 for the red clump giants), and assuming in this filter 0.05\nmag/kpc of extinction. Between l = +12\u25e6 and l = +28\u25e6 every four degrees, except\nl = 24\u25e6 , which is in a high extinction region and no hump associated with the red\nclump is observed. These GLIMPSE data have recently been analysed by Benjamin et\nal. (2005), who found that, when plotting the power law exponent of the star counts\nin the mid infrared (their Fig. 2), a different structure distinct from the disc can be\nobserved for |l| <\u2248 30\u25e6 , a hump superimposed on the disc counts. They suggest this\nto be due to the red clump giants of the long bar. They measured the position angle\nto be 44 \u00b1 10\u25e6. Indeed, fig. 1 of Benjamin et al. (2005) also shows quite clearly how the\nstar counts in the mid infrared (with very low extinction) trace an in-plane structure\nbetween l = \u221214\u25e6 and l = +30\u25e6. This rediscovery of the long-bar has revived interest\nin the hypothesis.\n\u2022 Cabrera-Lavers et al. (2006b). We add new data for b between -1\u25e6 and +1\u25e6 , and l\nbetween +18\u25e6 and +28\u25e6 . The source of the data is the same that of H00 and Picaud\net al. (2003) but with more recent observations: TCS-CAIN data (Cabrera-Lavers et\nal. 2006a).\nFigure 5 shows how the data fit the H00 bar with a position angle of 43\u25e6 \u00b1 7\u25e6 . The\nerror bars of the points represented are roughly 700 pc at 5.7 kpc (l = 27\u25e6 ) from the Sun\n(H00) and somewhat higher for lower values of l; many authors give lower errors for their\npoints but we think they were over-optimistic in their estimation of systematic and random\nerrors. Most of the points are within the expected prediction for the H00 long bar. Perhaps\nthe dispersion of points in the data of Cabrera-Lavers et al. (2006b) indicates that the error\nin distance is higher than 700 pc. There is one point (at l = +9.7\u25e6 : x = 887 pc, y = 5247\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\npc) in Babusiaux & Gilmore (2005) that does not fit the long bar. This point is possibly\nin error or contaminated by the bulge. The presence of this point is used by Babusiaux &\nGilmore (2005) to claim that the bar position angle is 22.5\u25e6 (a fit made with only 3 points\nand rejecting the point at l = \u22129.7\u25e6 ), but in view of all the other data, it is more likely that\nwe have to reject instead the point at l = +9.7\u25e6 . Values for the position angle lower than 35\ndegrees fail to fit all these data.\nThis angle of around 40\u201345 degrees also agrees with previous estimates. Peters (1975)\nmodelled the H i distribution with an orientation of 45 deg. The first direct evidence of\na large stellar bar was produced by Weinberg (1992), who used AGB stars from the IRAS\nPoint Source Catalog (1985) to trace the stellar density distribution within the solar circle.\nIn spite of his simplistic assumptions of a homogeneous AGB sample with a low dispersion\nin luminosity and dust extinction proportional to distance within the solar circle, Weinberg\ngave estimates of the bar orientation (36 \u00b1 10 deg) and semilength (\u223c5 kpc). Sevenster et\nal. (1999) measured a position angle of 45 degrees when analysing the structure in the plane\n(and 25 degrees in off-plane regions, which denotes the absence of a bar and only the presence\nof a triaxial bulge away from the plane). van Loon et al. (2003) detected the long bar at a\nGalactocentric radius of R \u2265 1 kpc and measured a position angle, \u03c6 \u223c 40\u25e6 . Groenewegen &\nBlommaert (2005) measured \u03c6 = 47 \u00b1 17\u25e6 in the relationship between the zero point of the\nK-band period\u2013luminosity relation of Mira variables and galactic longitude although they\nincluded data between b = \u22121.2\u25e6 and b = \u22125.8\u25e6 within |l| < 12\u25e6 , so this corresponds to the\nlong bar + thick bulge.\n\n4.\n\nOther parameters of the bar\n\nIn Table 1 we summarize the parameters of the bar. The major axis semilength, 3.9\nkpc, is derived assuming that the end of the bar is at l = 27\u25e6 , that the angle of the bar is 43\u25e6 ,\nand that the distance to the Galactic Center is R\u2299 = 8 kpc. The thickness may be derived,\nas we have said, from the dispersion in the red clump stars, which is roughly 0.5\u20130.6 mag\n(H00; Benjamin et al. 2005; Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2006b). In particular, a fit of the data\nwith |b| \u2264 1\u25e6 from Cabrera et al. (2006b) (plotted in Fig. 4) gives:\n\u03c3red\n\nclump\n\n= (0.640 \u00b1 0.037) \u2212 (0.0044 \u00b1 0.018) l(deg.) mag\n\n(1)\n\nWe assume an intrinsic Gaussian dispersion of the red clump of 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 mag (L\u00f3pezCorredoira et al. 2002) and consider the variation in height along the line of sight of the bar\nwithin |b| \u2264 1\u25e6 to be negligible. We also take into account that, because the orientation of\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe bar, the angle between the line of sight and the direction perpendicular to the bar is\n\u03b1 = 90\u25e6 \u2212 43\u25e6 \u2212 l (so we must multiply the thickness along the line of sight by a factor cos \u03b1)\nsin 43\u25e6\nand the distance of the bar is r(l) = R\u2299 sin(43\n\u25e6 +l) , so that\n\u03c3thickness\n\nbar\n\n\u2248 (1420 \u00b1 170) \u2212 (12.6 \u00b1 5.6) l(deg.) pc.\n\n(2)\n\nThis would be the horizontal thickness of the bar (within which \u2248 68% of the stars are\ncontained). For low values l it becomes thicker because it is mixed with the bulge. For\ngalactic longitudes around l \u2248 20\u25e6 , the thickness is 1170 \u00b1 200 pc. Between l = 20\u25e6 and\nl = 30\u25e6 it is nearly constant.\nThe vertical thickness is derived when we examine the decrease in the red clump stars\nin Cabrera-Lavers et al.'s (2006b) data, giving a number of around 200 pc (i.e. a scaleheight\nof around 100 pc both in the north and in the south).\nThe mean density is derived by means of\nExcess counts(mK < 9, l) \u2248 \u03c9[\u2206r(l)]r(l)2 \u03c6[MK < 9 \u2212 5 log10 r(l) + 5 \u2212 AK (r(l), l)]\u03c1.\nFrom Fig. 1, the excess counts in positive longitudes over negative longitudes is \u2248 1000 deg\u22122\nbar\n.\n[surface: \u03c9 = 1 deg\u22122 = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 rad\u22122 ], roughly independent of l. \u2206r(l) = \u03c3thickness\nsin(43\u25e6 +l)\nThe extinction AK (r(l), l) \u2248 1.2 (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2001b), roughly independent of l.\nFor l = 20\u25e6 , r(l) = 6.1 kpc, which gives MK,max = 9 \u2212 5 log10 r(l) + 5 \u2212 AK (r(l), l) = \u22126.1.\nHence,\n\u03c6[MK < \u22126.1]\u03c1 = 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 star pc\u22123 ,\n(3)\na factor 4 lower value than the rough calculations in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2001b, \u00a76.2),\nmainly due to the different thickness used here.\nRoughly speaking, if we assume as a model for the bar a box of dimensions 7.8 \u00d7 1.17 \u00d7\n0.3 = 2.7 kpc3 with average density of stars up to MK = \u22126.1 equal to \u03c6[MK < \u22126.1]\u03c1(l =\n20\u25e6 ) = 7 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc\u22123 , the total number of stars up to absolute magnitude \u22126.1 is \u223c200000.\nFor comparison, the bulge up to this absolute magnitude has around 600 000 stars (L\u00f3pezCorredoira et al. 2000, \u00a76.5), so the bar has a third as many stars as the bulge at this range\nof magnitudes. These bright stars would represent a fraction 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 [from the integration\nof the bulge luminosity function in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2000] of the total number of stars;\nthat is, if we assume a similar ratio for the bar, \u03c1 \u2248 3.5 star pc\u22123 .\nWe cannot derive directly the mass of the bar from the present numbers. We would\nneed a stellar library with an exact knowledge of the population of the long bar, which is a\ntask for a future work. If we assumed roughly that the populations of the thick bulge and\nthe long bar were similar, since the long bar has a third as many bright stars as the thick\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbulge and the bulge has 1.7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 (Sevenster et al. 1999), the bar would have \u223c 6 \u00d7 109\nM\u2299 .\nSince this article is concerned solely with star counts based on NIR photometry, the\nkinematics of the bar cannot be discussed here, but other authors have studied it; e.g.\nDebattista et al. (2002), although these authors do not distinguish between a thick bulge\nand a long bar. It remains to be studied whether or the thick bulge and the long bar have\nthe same pattern speed. A project dedicated to measuring with accuracy the velocities of\nthe plane stars at 0\u25e6 < |l| < 30\u25e6 would be warranted. Forthcoming surveys such as RAVE\n(Steinmetz et al. 2006) will in this sense provide valuable information for separating the\ndifferent components along the line of sight in the central plane regions.\n\n5.\n\nBulge contamination\n\nThroughout the present paper we have presented two kinds of data that show the presence of the bar: 1) counts of bright stars and 2) results from the red clump method. In both\ncases, the presence of the bulge is important only for low values of galactic longitude:\n1. The star counts in Fig. 2 give an excess of \u223c1000 stars deg\u22122 in positive galactic\nlongitudes. According to the models in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. (2005; Model 1), the\ncontribution of the thick bulge in the plane for these magnitudes is lower than 20% of\nthis amount for l < \u22129.5\u25e6 or l > 13\u25e6 and lower than 10% of this amount for l < \u221212\u25e6 or\nl > 17\u25e6 . This can indeed be observed in the Fig. 2, where the decreasing density of the\nbulge is not significant away from |l| equal to 10 or 12 degrees. Therefore, the (nearly\nflat) excess of counts for higher |l| values than these make no significant contribution\nto the bulge. The same applies to Fig. 1 and the MSX bar counts of Fig. 3 (to be\nTable 1: Approximate parameters of the long bar\nParameter\nAngle Galactic Center\u2013major axis:\nMajor semiaxis length:\nHorizontal thickness at l = 20\u25e6 :\nVertical thickness at l = 20\u25e6 :\nStar density at l = 20\u25e6 , b = 0 with MK < \u22126.1:\nTotal mass (assuming bulge stellar pop.):\n\nValue\n43\u25e6\n3900 pc\n1170 pc\n200 pc\n7 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc\u22123\n6 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncompared with the bulge counts in L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2001a).\n2. The density of red clump stars is proportional to the total density of stars. The\nbulge along the major axis of the bar has a density 6.6 exp [\u22121.1x1 /(740 pc)] star pc\u22123\n(L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2005), where x1 is the distance from the center. If we take\nthe value of the star density in the bar estimated in \u00a74 as a \u03c1 = 3.5 star pc\u22123 , the\nbulge would be responsible for 20% of the bar counts at t = 1510 pc (equivalent to\nl = 8.5\u25e6 ) and 10% of the bar counts at t = 1970 pc (equivalent to l = 11.5\u25e6 ). For\nlongitudes lower than 8.5\u25e6 (|x| < 1000 pc in Fig. 5) the bulge contaminates more than\n20% of the bar contribution so we are measuring the position angle of a mixture of two\npopulations.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur conclusion is therefore that recent available data on the long bar corroborate H00's\nhypothesis. The Milky Way has a long thin bar with approximate dimensions 7.8 kpc \u00d71.2\nkpc \u00d70.2 kpc; a position angle of the major axis with respect to the line Galactic centerSun of approximately 43\u25e6 ; density of stars (brighter in K-band than MK = \u22126.1) around\n7 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc\u22123 , and approximately the third part of stars of the thick bulge if we assume\nsimilar stellar populations for both components. GLIMPSE data (Benjamin et al. 2005)\nexplicitly supported this model, and other data on the distance of the long bar derived with\nthe red clump method agree in general with this scenario.\n\nAcknowledgments\nM.

Two effects produce the difference: i) the most important is that the\nline of sight reaches its maximum at the tangential point to the innermost ellipsoid and this\nis not in general in the major axis (see Fig. 6); ii) moreover, in off-plane regions, the lines\nof sight are not parallel to the plane b = 0-the larger the distance the farther away from\nthe plane and the lower the densities become, so the maximum of the line of sight is indeed\ncloser than the real maximum in a plane parallel to b = 0.\nWe can derive analytically this difference (\u2206r = rm \u2212 ra ) between the maximum density\nposition along the line of sight (rm ), and the intersection of the line of sight with the major\naxis (ra ) for the case of triaxial ellipsoids with density decreasing monotonically outwards.\nThe ellipsoidal isodensity contours are defined by the points of space with the same value of\nt:\nq\nt = x21 + (x2 /A)2 + (x3 /B)2 .\n(A1)\nA and B are the axial ratios of the second and third axes with respect to the major axes of\nthe ellipsoids, and xi are the cartesian coordinates with the axis of the ellipsoids centred on\nthe Galactic Centre; that is,\nx1 = x sin \u03b1 \u2212 y cos \u03b1,\n(A2)\nx2 = x cos \u03b1 + y sin \u03b1,\n\n(A3)\n\nx3 = z.\n\n(A4)\n\nWe have assumed that the minor axis is perpendicular to the Galactic plane (x3 = z). x,\ny, z are the cartesian coordinates with XY defining the plane of the Galaxy, centred on the\nGalactic Centre, with the y-axis in the Sun\u2013Galactic Centre line. \u03b1 is the angle between the\nmajor axis of the ellipsoid and this y-axis. That is,\nx = r sin l cos b,\n\n(A5)\n\ny = r cos l cos b \u2212 R\u2299 , ,\n\n(A6)\n\nz = r sin b.\n\n(A7)\n\nThe maximum density, the tangential point of the line of sight with the innermost\nellipsoid, i.e. maximum density, follows\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\u2202t\n(rm ) = 0.\n\u2202r\nEquation (A8) with (A1) lead together to\nx2 (rm ) \u2202x2\nx3 (rm ) \u2202x3\n\u2202x1\n(rm ) +\n(rm ) +\n(rm ) = 0,\n2\n\u2202r\nA\n\u2202r\nB 2 \u2202r\nwhich with all the above expressions lead to\nh\ni\nR\u2299\ntan(l+\u03b1) sin \u03b1\ncos\n\u03b1\n+\n2\ncos b\nA\nrm =\n,\n\u0001\nb 2\n1\ncos(l + \u03b1) + A12 sin(l + \u03b1) tan(l + \u03b1) + tan\nB\ncos(l+\u03b1)\nx1 (rm )\n\n(A8)\n\n(A9)\n\n(A10)\n\nwhile the position of the major axis (simple geometry with the application of the sine rule,\nsee Fig. 6) is\nR\u2299\nsin \u03b1\nra =\n.\n(A11)\ncos b sin(l + \u03b1)\nBoth expressions for rm and ra are coincident for A \u226a (very elongated ellipsoids) and\ntan b \u226a (in the plane), but the remaining cases are affected by a non-negligible systematic\nerror, \u2206r. Calculations are carried out for A = 0.11, B = 0.04, \u03b1 = 43\u25e6 , typical of a long\nbar: Fig. 7. The low thickness of the bar (around 1 kpc thick) is justifiable because of the\nlow dispersion of the red clump giants (see section 4). The result is that \u2206r is negligible for\nthe bar, less than \u223c50 pc of systematic error within |b| < 1\u25e6 . However, it is not negligible\nfor the bulge, which reaches a discrepancy of up to 1000 pc (Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2006b).\n\nB.\n\nDifference in maximum density along the line of sight and the maximum of\nstar counts vs. magnitude\n\nThe maximum of star counts vs. magnitude is not strictly coincident with the maximum\nin density along the line of sight. The distribution of the magnitude histogram counts in a\nsolid angle \u03c9 is indeed (assuming a constant absolute magnidude M for all red clump stars\nand extinction E(r) along the line of sight):\nA(m)dm = \u03c9r 2\u03c1(r)dr,\nr = 10\n\nm\u2212M +5\u2212E(r)\n5\n\n(B1)\n(B2)\n\nStrictly speaking, we would need to transform A(m)dm into \u03c1(r)dr, and then fit its maximum. From the relationship between \u03c1(r) and A(m) it can be deduced that the difference\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\u2217\nbetween the corrected distance to the maximum in the density distribution (rm\nsuch that\n\u2032 \u2217\n\u03c1 (rm ) = 0) and the distance obtained to the maximum in the counts histograms (rm such\nthat A\u2032 (m[rm ]) = 0) is [neglecting the term E \u2032 (r)]:\n\nA(m) \u221d r 3 \u03c1(r),\n\n(B3)\n\n\u2217\nrm\n= rm + \u2206rm\n\n(B4)\n\n\u2206rm =\n\n3 \u03c1(rm )\n.\nrm \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (rm )\n\n(B5)\n\n\u2217\nAs \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (rm ) < 0, then rm\n< rm , thus the corrected distances are slightly lower than those\nobtained from the maximum of the magnitude histograms. This effect is more noticieable\nfor the bulge component than for the long thin bar, as \u03c1\u2032\u2032 (rm ) is very large for the bar.\nCabrera-Lavers et al. (2006b) have estimated the range of values for \u2206rm both for the bulge\nand for the bar, and have found the true density distributions along the line of sight. \u2206rm\nranges from 100 to 300 pc in bulge fields, whereas for bar fields the effect is almost negligible\nwith corrections in the order of 25\u201350 pc.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nmk<9\n\no\n\no\n\n\u22120.25 < b < 0.25\n\n4000\n3500\n\n2500\n\nStars deg\n\n\u22122\n\n3000\n\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nlongitude (deg)\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221240\n\nFig. 1.- 2MASS star counts showing the asymmetry in the plane between positive and\nnegative longitudes in |l| < 30\u25e6 .
