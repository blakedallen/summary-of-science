Experiments have been performed at the MIT Bates Laboratory [1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], at the Saclay Laboratory [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and at SLAC [16, 17, 18] in\norder to explore this reaction. A recent review of quasi-elastic scattering provides a guide to the\nexperimental and theoretical results [19]. Generally it is assumed that the reaction is dominated\nby the exchange of one hard photon between the electron and a nucleon in the nucleus. Many\nsoft photons also are exchanged and their effects are described by distorted waves based on the\nCoulomb potential in the initial and final states of the electron. An important issue is to account\nfor the effects of the Coulomb interaction in a manner that allows extraction of the nuclear response\nfunctions, RL and RT , which correspond to plane-wave matrix elements of the longitudinal and\ntransverse parts of the currents. After the nucleon form factor is divided out, the longitudinal\nresponse function at a fixed and sufficiently large value of the momentum transfer, q, is expected\nR\nto satisfy a Coulomb sum rule, i.e., d\u03c9SL (q, \u03c9) \u2248 Z, where Z is the number of protons. Such\na sum rule should hold under general conditions for a nonrelativistic description of nuclear wave\nfunctions and currents provided only that q is sufficiently large to make the effects of correlations\nsmall. Although the response functions are affected by the final-state interactions (FSI), the sum\nrule should not be affected by them because it relies on a sum over a complete set of final states\nof the nucleus. When relativistic effects in the nuclear current are taken into account, there are\nminor relativistic corrections to the sum rule but it remains useful. However, attempts to verify it\nexperimentally have produced puzzling results and controversy about Coulomb corrections.\nIn order to obtain the longitudinal response function, it is conventional to perform a Rosenbluth\nseparation after dividing the cross section by the Mott cross section \u03c3M and some kinematical\nfactors,\n1 d\u03c3\nq4\n1\nexpt\n\u01eb 4 = \u01eb RL\n(q, \u03c9) +\n\u03c3M d\u03a9d\u03c9 Q\n2\n\nq2\nQ2\n\n!\n\nRTexpt(q, \u03c9)\n\n(1)\n\nwith Q2 = \u03c9 2 \u2212 q 2 and where \u03c3M = 4\u03b12 Ef2 cos2 ( 21 \u03b8e )/Q4 . The longitudinal virtual-photon polarization is defined as\n\u03b8e\n2q 2\n\u01eb = 1 + 2 tan2\nQ\n2\n\n!\u22121\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nAt fixed q and \u03c9, it varies from 0 to 1 as the electron scattering angle \u03b8e varies from 180 to 0\ndegrees. Measurements of the cross section at different values of \u01eb for fixed values of q and \u03c9 allow\n2\n\n\fexpt\nexpt\na separation of the experimental response functions, RL\nand RTexpt. The RL\nthat is extracted\n\nfrom experimental cross section as in Eq. (1) can differ from the desired RL , which is the planewave matrix element of the longitudinal current, for two reasons. One is that Coulomb corrections\nassociated with spin-dependent effects in the electron wave functions can cause the contributions of\nthe longitudinal and transverse currents to have different dependence on \u03b8e than is assumed in the\nRosenbluth separation. [20] The other is that Coulomb distorted waves alter the response. These\nCoulomb corrections should be removed before the Coulomb sum rule can be evaluated. In addition,\nnucleon form factors should be divided out of the longitudinal response function. A standard\napproach to modeling the Coulomb corrections is to use the distorted wave Born approximation\n(DWBA). One solves the Dirac equation for the electron distorted waves in the presence of the\nCoulomb potential for both the initial and final states of the electron. [21, 22, 23, 24] When\nthese distorted waves are combined with nuclear wave functions obtained from a model of nuclear\nstructure, and appropriate current operators, cross sections may be calculated and compared with\nexperimental results. The DWBA analysis involves extensive numerical calculations. Owing to the\ninfinite range of the Coulomb potential, partial-wave expansions converge very slowly, the more so\nas the energy increases.\nA number of works have used the eikonal approximation in order to simplify the analysis at high\nenergies. The use of the eikonal approximation also must be accompanied by inclusion of \"focusing\nfactors\" that are not present in the eikonal wave functions. [25, 26, 27] Czyz and Gottfried [28] used\nthe eikonal approximation to analyze electron scattering but that work did not include focusing\nfactors. An analysis based on the Schrodinger equation showed that the corrections to the eikonal\napproximation generally produce a focusing factor in the wave function. [29] Work by Giusti et\nal. also is based on the eikonal approximation [30, 31] and some recents works have combined the\neikonal approximation with semi-classical focusing factors in order to assess Coulomb corrections\nin quasi-elastic scattering. [32, 33]\nA very simple effective-momentum approximation (EMA) for treating the Coulomb corrections\nwas developed by Rosenfelder[27] and Triani et al. [34, 35]. In the EMA the effects of the Coulomb\npotential are incorporated as shifts of the initial and final electron momentum values that should\nbe used in a plane-wave Born approximation (PWIA) analysis. The shifted electron momenta are\nthe effective momenta. They imply a corresponding shift of the photon momentum, q \u2192 qef f .\nInterpretations of quasi-elastic data depend upon many experimental details and different experiments have produced significantly different values of the Coulomb sum rule. [19, 36] In addition\nto possible experimental differences, there are theoretical differences in the analysis of the Coulomb\n3\n\n\fcorrections because the DWBA analysis based on partial waves has been used for some experiments\nand the EMA analysis has been used for others. Sometimes it is assumed that the nucleon form\nfactors can be pulled out of the matrix element and evaluated at the momentum transfer of the\nelectron. [24] At other times the form factors are evaluated at the effective photon momentum,\nqef f .\nIn order to address questions about the theoretical differences in the treatment of Coulomb\ndistorted waves, we developed a systematic eikonal expansion in Ref. [37] that provides more\naccurate eikonal wave functions for a DWBA analysis. The accuracy is good enough to eliminate\nconcerns about use of the eikonal approximation at the energies of interest. Moreover the \"focusing\nfactors\" arise naturally as part of the corrections to the eikonal approximation and the ad-hoc\nprocedure of incorporating them is replaced by a systematic procedure. The eikonal expansion was\nfound to converge rapidly at electron energies of interest. It has the advantage of providing insight\ninto the nature of the Coulomb corrections because the focusing factors, the eikonal phase shifts\nthat determine the momentum shifts and spin-dependent effects can be isolated for study.\nIn order to assess the accuracy of the EMA using the eikonal wave functions, we used in Ref. [37]\na very simple model of the nuclear wave functions and we neglected the spin-dependent Coulomb\ncorrections for simplicity. In order to compare full DWBA calculations of RL with the results based\non the EMA, the DWBA results were fit to the EMA formula,\nP W IA\nRL (q, \u03c9) = A RL\n(qef f , \u03c9),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the effective photon momentum is given by\nh\ni\nh\ni\nqef f = k\u0302i ki \u2212 \u03b4k \u2212 k\u0302f kf \u2212 \u03b4k .\n\n(4)\n\nThere are two parameters in our EMA fits: the momentum-shift \u03b4k and the overall normalization\nconstant A \u2248 1. Usually the parameter A is assumed to be unity when experimental data are fit\nusing Eq. (3). In model calculations that assumption can be checked because the PWIA response\nis known in the model. A factor fEM A can be used to relate \u03b4k to the Coulomb potential at r = 0,\nas follows,\nfEM A =\n\n\u03b4k\n.\nVc (0)\n\n(5)\n\nThe factor fEM A is approximately the same for different nuclei. We found momentum shifts in\nFig. 7 of Ref. [37] that correspond to fEM A (\u03c9) \u2248 0.7 near the peak of the response function for\n500 MeV e\u2212 scatttering. Larger values of fEM A up to about 1 were found at the smallest and\n4\n\n\flargest \u03c9 values but the response is small at those points. Although fits of the DWBA results\ncan be made more precise by allowing \u03b4k to depend on the energy loss, \u03c9, in this work we use a\nconstant shift \u03b4k. That yields reasonable results and is simpler and thus preferable for the analysis\nof experimental data.\nIf the momentum-shift \u03b4k and normalization constant A are determined theoretically for a given\nnucleus such that the DWBA response is well described by the EMA fit of Eq. (3), then one may\nequate RL (q, \u03c9) at fixed electron beam energy, E, and fixed momentum transfer q to a constant\nA times the PWIA response function evaluated at the effective momentum transfer. That would\nremove the Coulomb effects to a reasonable approximation and allow the PWIA response to be\nextracted from experimental data. We expect similar Coulomb corrections for a variety of nuclear\nmodels. [39] The goal is to remove them with minimal reliance on any nuclear model. However, it\nmust first be determined how well RL can be extracted from experimental data.\nThe spin-dependence of the eikonal wave functions was omitted in our previous paper, which\nleft unanswered the question of the accuracy with which the desired response functions might be\nextracted from experimental cross sections. That is the first issue addressed in this paper. In\nSec. II we restate the essential results of the eikonal expansion for Dirac wave functions and focus\non the spin-dependent eikonal corrections. These are shown to provide very small differences to\nquasi-elastic cross sections, i.e., the helicity matrix elements of the electron current are very close\nto those based on the PWIA. The consequence is that when both initial and final electron energies\nare 200 MeV or more, the usual Rosenbluth separation provides an accurate separation of RL and\nRT , well within the limits of experimental accuracy. Although the Rosenbluth separation should be\naccurate, there remain significant Coulomb effects within RL . They can be treated with reasonable\naccuracy by use of the effective momentum approximation.\nIn order to determine more realistic values of the momentum shift, \u03b4k, shell model wave functions are used to describe the nucleus in this work. Our calculations are simplified by use of\nan approximation that is introduced by us in Ref. [38] and described in Section III, and which\nis denoted EMAr. That approximation applies the effective momentum approximation to the\nhard-photon propagator and form factors in order to reduce the numerical evaluation to a threedimensional integration that provides a careful treatment of the full r-dependence of the Coulombic\neffects from the electron wave functions. In the EMAr analysis, the nuclear current is handled in\nterms of a hadronic tensor, which can be extended to include the neutron contributions to cross\nsections. A comparison of the full DWBA and EMAr calculations for the 1s shell of\nclose agreement of the results.\n5\n\n208 P b\n\nshows\n\n\fSection IV presents numerical calculations for quasi-elastic scattering by\n\n208 P b\n\nand\n\n56 F e\n\nusing\n\nkinematics that are relevant to a recent experiment at Jefferson Laboratory. The nuclear model used\nis simple and a number of significant effects are omitted from the calculations, such as final-state\ninteractions [40], correlations, [41, 42] and pion and \u2206 production [43, 44], but the calculated cross\nsections are expected to be roughly similar to experimental ones. The main goal is to determine\nsuitable fitting parameters for use in applying Eq. (3) to experimental data so as to determine\nP W IA . Conclusions are presented in Section V.\nRL\n\nII.\n\nQUASI-ELASTIC RESPONSE FUNCTIONS\n\nBecause electron energies of interest generally are much greater than the electron mass, and the\nCoulomb potential and photon exchange are vector interactions, electron helicity is conserved to\na very high degree of accuracy in quasi-elastic scattering. For example, using 500 MeV electrons\none finds that the helicity is conserved except for terms of relative order m2e /E 2 \u2248 10\u22126 . In this\nwork we keep only the effects that are consistent with helicity conservation.\nThe distorted-wave Born approximation is used with eikonal wave functions for the electron.\nFor outgoing-wave (+) or incoming-wave (-) boundary conditions, the Dirac wave functions for\npotential V (r) are written as [37]\n\uf8eb\n\nu(\u00b1) (r)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(\u00b1)\n\uf8f8 \u03be\u03bb ,\n\u03a8k,\u03bb (r) = \uf8ed\n2\u03bbu(\u00b1) (r)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV 1/2 ikz i\u03c7(\u00b1) \u2212\u03c9(\u00b1) i\u03c3e \u03b3\u0304 (\u00b1)\n(\u00b1)\nu (r) = 1 \u2212\ne e\ne\ne\n,\nE2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03be\u03bb is a two-component helicity spinor and \u03bb = \u00b1 12 is the helicity eigenvalue. The lower components of the Dirac spinor are simply 2\u03bb times the upper components because the electron mass\nis neglected. The wave propagates in the z-direction, which is along the asymptotic momentum k,\nand an impact vector b is defined as the part of r that is perpendicular to the \u1e91-direction.

[37] because a factor\n\n(14)\n1\n2\n\nwas omitted\n\nthere.\nOur previous numerical calculations omitted the spin-dependent Coulomb corrections, using\ninstead the PWIA helicity matrix elements that are indicated following the arrows in Eq. (12).\nIn this work we include the spin-dependent Coulomb corrections and find the important result\nthat they provide negligible corrections to quasi-elastic cross sections. This can be understood\nqualitatively as follows. For a 500 MeV electron scattering from the Coulomb potential of a\n208 P b\n\nnucleus, the phase \u03b3\u0304 (+) = \u03b3 (+) + i\u03b4(+) typically has magnitude of 0.03 or less as shown in\n\nFig. 3. It vanishes at zero impact parameter. Consequently, the coefficients A2\u03bbi \u2248 1 + O(\u03b3\u0304)2 and\n\nB2\u03bbi \u2248 1+O(\u03b3\u0304)2 are very close to unity. The coefficients C2\u03bbi and D2\u03bbi have contributions that are\n\u0010\nfirst order in \u03b3\u0304. They also involve phase factors e2i\u03bbi \u03c6i or e2i\u03bbi \u03c6f , where tan\u03c6f = tan\u03c6i / cos \u03b82e \u2212\n\u0011\nsin \u03b82e /(tan\u03b8i cos\u03c6i ) with \u03b8i and \u03c6i being the angles of the vector r relative to the polar axis along\nk\u0302i . When current matrix elements are integrated over r and summed over helicities, cancellations\n\nstemming from these phase factors cause the contributions to be very small. Current matrix\nelements are Fourier transforms and the \u03c6i,f dependent phase factors can receive support in the\nintegration.

The net effect is to reduce substantially the contributions from terms that\ninvolve the azimuthal angles \u03c6i,f . Our numerical results show that cross sections calculated with\nthe spin-dependent Coulomb corrections included are closer than one part per thousand to ones\ncalculated using the PWIA helicity matrix elements. An example of this is shown in Figure 4, which\nshows the ratio of longitudinal response functions (calculated from Eq. (30)) with and without the\nspin-dependent Coulomb corrections at 500 MeV electron energy. Only for large energy loss, where\nthe final state electron energy becomes small, does the ratio differ from unity by more that a few\nparts in ten thousand. For reference, the dotted line shows the variation of 1 + .0001RL . Note\nthat for energy loss \u03c9 = 300 MeV, the final electron energy is 200 MeV, but the ratio of cross\nsections with and without the Coulomb spin corrections differs from unity by less that one part\nper thousand. As the energy loss increases, the Coulomb spin corrections become relatively more\nimportant but the response function is decreasing to zero.

Note that the effects of the\n\nspin-dependent Coulomb corrections are largest for \u03c9-values where the response function is a small fraction\nof its maximum value.\n\nis important because the helicity matrix elements govern the dependence of the cross sections on\nthe electron scattering angle, \u03b8e , at fixed q. When the PWIA helicity matrix elements provide\nan accurate approximation, the angle dependence is the same as in PWIA cross sections, and\nthe Rosenbluth separation can be used to extract the longitudinal and transverse current matrix\nelements. We find negligible mixing of actual longitudinal and transverse current matrix elements\nin the response functions extracted using the Rosenbluth separation for all the cases evaluated in\nthis paper.\nSignificant Coulombic effects remain in the RL and RT response functions that can be extracted\n12\n\n\fby use of the Rosenbluth separation because of the spin-independent Coulomb effects. They may\nbe treated using an effective momentum approximation.\n\nIII.\n\nEFFECTIVE PHOTON MOMENTUM APPROXIMATION\n\nBecause the effective-momentum approximation was found to be accurate in our prior work, in\nthis work we approximate the photon momentum q\u2032 that appears in the photon propagator and\nthe nucleon current of Eq. (8) by an effective momentum qef f as follows,\nj\u03bcN (p, q\u2032 )\nq\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2\n\n\u2192\n\nj\u03bcN (p, qef f )\n,\nq2ef f \u2212 \u03c9 2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere qef f is given in Eq. (4). Note that this approximation also evaluates the nucleon form factors\nwithin the nucleon current at the effective photon momentum. This is a minimal use of the effectivemomentum approximation designed to reduce the computation to a three-dimensional form, i.e.,\nthe approximation allows the photon propagator and the nuclear current to be factored out of the\nR d3 q\u2032 \u2212iq\u2032 *r\n\u03c8nlm (q\u2032 \u2212 p) = e\u2212ip*r \u03c8nlm (r).

It has the\nadvantage over the usual EMA of not approximating the r-dependence of the eikonal phases and\nfocusing factors that provide the Coulomb corrections to the electron wave functions. The threedimensional integration of Eq. (17) provides a good correspondence with the full DWBA analysis\nat much lower computational cost. Procedures to determine appropriate values of \u03b4k, and thus the\neffective photon momentum that is factored out of the integral, are discussed further on.\n\nA.\n\nHadronic tensor\n\nIn the EMAr analysis, the bound-state nucleon's wave function is taken to be a product of a\nDirac spinor, u(p\u2212q), times a nonrelativistic wave function for a nucleon, i.e., (M/(Ep\u2212q )1/2 u(p\u2212\n\n13\n\n\fq)\u03c8nlm (p \u2212 q), and the knocked-out nucleon's wave function is a Dirac spinor, (M/Ep )1/2 u(p).\nThe relevant nucleon current is\nh\ni\ni\u03ba\nj\u03bcN = K 1/2 \u016b(p) \u03b3\u03bc F1 +\nF2 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q \u03bd u(p \u2212 q),\n2M\n\n(18)\n\nwhere F1 (Q2 ) and F2 (Q2 ) are nucleon form factors, \u03ba is the anomalous magnetic moment and\nK = M 2 /(Ep Ep\u2212q ) is a normalization factor arising from the spinors.

The second prefactor should cancel\nto a large extent with similar factors in the M0nlm amplitude. In particular, the helicity matrix\n\nelement h0e \u2248 cos( \u03b82e ) cancels to a high degree. To the extent that the focusing factors from\n\nthe electron wave functions in the DWBA matrix element can be approximated at r = 0, they\nk ef f k ef f\n\ngive approximately a factor i ki kff to the matrix element, which should cancel with Q4 /Q4ef f =\n\u0010\n\u00112\nki kf\nfrom the prefactor.

For\n\nexample, the contributions from radial wave functions that vanish at r = 0, as in the shells with\nL > 0, depend on the focusing factors away from the origin. Consequently, accurate values of \u03b4k\nare not known a priori such that the second prefactor cancels the Coulomb effects owing to focusing\nfactors. A procedure is needed to determine them.\nIn order to test the Coulomb sum rule, one should remove the nucleon form factor. Consistent\nwith the photon momentum in the nuclear current being shifted, the form factors evaluated at\nQ2ef f should be divided out of the cross section, giving\nSL (q, \u03c9) =\nZ\nC.\n\n1 RL (q, \u03c9)\n,\ne2 (Q2 )\nZG\nE\nef f\n\nd\u03c9SL (q, \u03c9) \u2248 1.\n\n(31)\n\nComparison of EMAr and DWBA analyses\n\nThe six-dimensional (6D) integration of Eq. (8) should be performed for nuclear models in order\nto obtain the full DWBA response function. Similar calculations of the EMAr response function\nshould then be normalized, by choice of the Qef f value in the prefactor of the EMAr amplitude, such\nthat the magnitude of the peak DWBA response is reproduced by the EMAr analysis. However, the\nfull six-dimensional integration in the matrix element together with the two-dimensional integration\nover angles of the final momenta is extremely time consuming when many shells contribute to the\nresponse. In this work, a limited form of the full DWBA analysis has been performed based on\nthe wave function of a single shell, the 1s shell of the\n16\n\n208 P b\n\nnucleus. We then normalize the EMAr\n\n\fanalysis to the DWBA analysis for the 1s-shell. Figure 5 shows the PWIA, EMAr and DWBA\nresponse functions based on the 1s shell. In the full DWBA calculation, the nucleon form factor\n\u0011\n\u0010\nF (q\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ), the photon propagator, 1/(q\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ), and the current-conservation factor 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 /q\u2032 2\n\nhave been evaluated at the running photon momentum that is integrated as in Eq.(8). The response\nfunction is obtained by dividing the resulting longitudinal cross section by the corresponding factors\n\u0011\n\u0010\neE (q 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 ) 1\u2212\u03c9 2 /q 2 /(q 2 \u2212\u03c9 2 ).

This is confirmed by fits of each of these responses to the\nEMA form of Eq. (3) using the parameters shown in Table I. The shift of the 1s-shell peak response\nrelative to the PWIA peak response is fit by \u03b4k of -22.0 MeV for the full DWBA case (labeled\n6D-Fexact in the table) and by -22.0 MeV for the EMAr response function. The magnitude of the\npeak EMAr response function is about 1.5% lower than that for the DWBA response function as\nshown by the A fit parameters in the table.\nIn order to test one of the assumptions of the EMA or EMAr analysis, we also calculated full\n17\n\n\fTABLE I: EMA fit parameters for the 1s shell response functions at E=500 MeV and q=550 MeV/c. \u03b4k is\nin MeV.\n\u03b4k\n\nfEMA\n\nA\n\n-22.0\n\n0.80\n\n0.985\n\n6D \u2212 Fexact -22.0\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n6D \u2212 Fef f -22.0\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\nEM Ar\n\nDWBA cross sections with the form factor and current-conservation factor evaluated at qef f and\nremoved from the integral over the photon momentum. However, the photon propagator was left\n(DW BA)\n\nwithin the integral. This allows a comparison of results for SL\n\nwith the nonlocality of the\n\nform factor integrated over versus otherwise identical results with the form factor evaluated at\nthe effective momentum transfer and taken out of the integral. In the latter case the form factor\n(DW BA)\n\nsimply cancels out of the result. When SL\n\nis calculated with the form factor evaluated at\n\nqef f and factored out of the integral, thus canceling, the result is fit using the parameters in the\n(DW BA)\n\nline of Table I labeled 6D-Fef f . When SL\n\nis calculated with the form factor integrated over\n\nand then divided out at qef f , the result is fit using the parameter values in the line labeled 6DFexact in the table. Both calculations are found to produce essentially the same response functions,\nSLDW BA , in the sense that the same fitting parameters describe both equally well. Thus, there is\nnot any evidence for errors associated with evaluating the form factor at qef f and factoring it out\nof the integral. This is a nontrivial and important result because the form factor reduces the cross\nsections by about a factor 4 for q=0.55 GeV/c. There would be a significant difference if the form\nfactor evaluated at the momentum transfer of the electron were divided out in Eq.(31) as has been\nassumed to be the correct procedure in some works. Use of the momentum transfer of the electron,\nq, versus the effective photon momentum, qef f , leads to a difference in cross sections by a factor\ne2 (q 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )/G\ne2 (q 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 ) \u2248 1.23 for\nG\nE\nE ef f\n\n208 P b\n\nat q = 0.55 GeV/c and \u03c9 = 0.17 GeV. We find very\n\nclear evidence from this analysis that the form factor should be evaluated at the effective photon\nmomentum transfer rather than the momentum transfer of the electron when response functions\nare extracted from data.\nWe draw the following conclusions from these tests. The EMAr approximation provides a good\napproximation to the full 6D DWBA analysis. It reproduces the shift of the DWBA response\nrelative to the PWIA response very well, i.e., the momentum shift \u03b4k is the same: (\u03b4k(6D =\n\u03b4k(EM Ar) ). When the focus factors are kept within the integration over r as in the EMAr analysis,\nthey do not cancel precisely with the prefactor Q4 /Q4ef f . The r-integration provides a normalization\n\n18\n\n\freduction of about 1.5%, i.e., A = 0.985 in fits of the EMAr results to the EMA form. In the 6D\nanalysis with the nonlocality of the photon propagator also included in the integration over photon\nmomentum, but everything else the same as in the EMAr calculation, there is no normalization\ncorrection, i.e., A = 1.00 in fits to the EMA form. We conclude that the nonlocality of the photon\npropagator produces a normalization 1.5% greater than the normalization of the EMAr response\n(6D)\n\nfunction: ( RL\n\n(EM Ar)\n\n\u2248 1.015RL\n\n), thus canceling the normalization reduction of the EMAr\n\nresult. In order to include the nonlocality of the photon propagator, the normalization of the EMAr\nresponse for 208 P b should be increased by the factor 1.015. It then agrees with the normalization of\nthe full DWBA result because the nonlocality of the photon propagator cancels the reduction that\narises in the EMAr result. The renormalized EMAr result is found to give excellent agreement with\nthe full DWBA results for both the shift and the normalization. When the nucleon form factor\nand current-conservation factors also are kept in the integration over photon momentum, there is\nno additional change of the normalization compared with evaluating those factors at qef f .\n\nD.\n\nComparison of EMAr and EMA calculations\n\nThe three-dimensional integral of Eq. (17) is dominated by a stationary phase point that may\nbe obtained by approximating the eikonal phase \u03c7(r) \u2248 \u03c7(0) + r * \u2207\u03c7(0) + * * * . The effective\nmomentum is then\nqef f = q + \u2207\u03c7(0)\nand the integral for the time-component of the current takes the form [using h0e = cos 21 \u03b8e ]\nZ\n1 i\u03c7(0)\n0,EM Ar \u2032\n= cos \u03b8e e\nMnlm\nd3 rei(qef f \u2212p)*r fi (r)ff (r)\u03c8nlm (r).\n2\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nGenerally it is found that the use of qef f overestimates the Coulomb corrections unless \u2207\u03c7(0) is\nreduced by a factor in order to simulate an average value over the nucleus, i.e.,\nqef f = q + fEM A \u2207\u03c7(0).\n\n(34)\n\nWe refer to this stationary-point analysis with the full r-dependence of the focus factors left within\nthe integral as EMAr' and use fEM A = 0.8, as is consistent with fits of the EMAr result.

The EMAr' stationary-point analysis using fEM A = 0.8 produces essentially the\nsame results as the EMAr that includes the integration over the variation of \u03c7(r). The EMA result\nis also very close to the results based on EMAr and EMAr'. Thus, it is clear that the integration\nover r that is incorporated in the EMAr analysis provides results that differ only in the fine details.\nThe usual EMA analysis is almost as good once one has in hand a reasonable value of fEM A to use.\nSome numerical values are given in Table II in order to provide a more quantitative comparison of\nthe approximations with the 6D calculation.\n\n7\n\n-1\n\nRL (GeV )\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\nFIG. 6: Longitudinal response function for the 1s-shell of\n\n208\n\n0.3\n\nP b based on the PWIA (dotted line), EMA (o\n\nsymbols), EMAr' (dash line), EMAr (solid line) and full 6D calculations (x symbols) at Ei = 500 Mev and\nq = 550 MeV/c.\n\n20\n\n\f5\n\n-1\n\nRT (GeV )\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.0\n\nFIG. 7:\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\nTransverse response function for the 1s-shell\n\n208\n\nP b based on the PWIA (dotted line), EMA (o\n\nsymbols), EMAr' (dash line), EMAr (solid line) and full 6D calculations (x symbols) at Ei = 500 Mev and\nq = 550 MeV/c.\n\nTABLE II: Numerical values for RL and RT for the 1s-shell of\n(P W IA)\n\n\u03c9 RL\n\nIV.\n\n(EMA)\n\nRL\n\n(EMAr)\n\nRL\n\n208\n\nP b at E=500 MeV and q=550 MeV/c.\n\n(EMAr \u2032 )\n\nRL\n\n(6D)\n\nRL\n\n0.10\n\n0.47\n\n0.15\n\n0.12\n\n0.15\n\n0.13\n\n0.16\n\n6.5\n\n5.4\n\n5.3\n\n5.5\n\n5.2\n\n0.20\n\n2.5\n\n\u03c9\n\n(P W IA)\nRT\n\n3.9\n\n0.10\n\n0.33\n\n0.11\n\n0.09\n\n0.11\n\n0.09\n\n0.16\n\n4.6\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n3.9\n\n0.20\n\n1.9\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n(EMA)\nRT\n\n4.1\n(EMAr)\nRT\n\n3.9\n(EMAr \u2032 )\nRT\n\n3.9\n(6D)\nRT\n\nCROSS SECTION CALCULATIONS\n\nNumerical calculations using the EMAr analysis have been performed including all shells of\nshell-model wave functions with the harmonic oscillator parameter adjusted so that the correct\nnuclear charge radius is obtained.

Our wave functions are approximate and final-state interactions of the knocked-out\nnucleon have been omitted. Cross sections presented in this work are not expected to be very close\nto experimental results, however, the nuclear model used is expected to be adequate for testing the\naccuracy with which Coulombic effects can be removed.\nWe have fit the EMAr longitudinal response functions to the EMA form as in Eq. (3) using the\nsame value of qef f in the prefactor of Eq. (30) as in the PWIA response function. The fits of the\nEMAr response function based on all shells yield similar values for A and a little smaller values\nfor \u03b4k compared with fits of the 1s shell response function. The fit parameters are summarized\nin Table IV. Accounting for the nonlocality of the photon propagator as in the results based on\nthe\n\n208 P b\n\n1s-shell DWBA response, the AEM Ar factors are renormalized by the factor 1.015 to\n\nestimate factors ADW BA for a full DWBA analysis that includes all shells. Our results support the\nuse of the EMA fits of experimental data as in Eq. (3) using A = 1. The fEM A factors are a little\nsmaller when all shells are included. That is understandable because higher shells include ones\nwith wave functions that vanish at r = 0.

The main focus is to use a known nuclear model (in\nthis case the shell model) in order to test how well the Coulomb corrections can be removed\nfrom DWBA cross sections using the effective-momentum approximation (EMA). The goal is to\nextract PWIA response functions from the DWBA cross sections. It is assumed that the Coulomb\ncorrections are not much affected by the nuclear model used.\nAt the electron beam energies considered in the work, namely 500 MeV and higher, the Coulomb\neffects in quasielastic scattering from nuclei can be described accurately using the eikonal distorted\nwaves that include higher-order corrections. The eikonal analysis has simplifying features because\none can isolate the phases that cause shifts of the electron momenta, the focusing factors and the\nspin phases that affect the L/T separation. We have used the analytical phases up to order 1/k 2 in\nthe eikonal expansion that were developed in Ref. [37]. As one check on the numerics, the eikonal\nphases were computed two ways: by direct numerical integration of the defining equations and by\n26\n\n\fPWBA\nEMA\nEMAr\n\n3\n\n-1\n\nRT (GeV )\n\n4\n\n2\n1\n0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\nFIG. 12: EMAr transverse response functions divided by Z for\n\n208\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nPb at Ei = 500 Mev and q = 550 MeV/c\n\n(solid line). The corresponding PWIA response function without Coulomb effects included is shown by the\ndashed line and the EMA calculation using fEMA = 0.8 and A = 1.0 is shown by the \u00d7 symbols.\n\nuse of the analytical formulas. Both give the same results. For the cases considered in this work,\nthe eikonal wave functions provide very well converged results. As a check of the three-dimensional\nintegration used in the EMAr analysis, the PWIA results were computed two ways: using analytical\nFourier transforms of the nucleon's bound state wave functions and by three-dimensional numerical\nintegration. The latter calculations are the same as those for the EMAr amplitude except that the\nCoulomb effects are omitted. With suitable integration grids the results are essentially the same\nat an accuracy better than 1% near the peak of response functions and errors at larger \u03c9 can be\n1% or 2% of the peak value of the response function. Generally the errors in numerical results are\ninsignificant in the plots.\nFull DWBA computations are extremely time consuming. An approximation called EMAr is\nused to simplify the analysis. The EMAr analysis evaluates the full r-dependence of the eikonal\ndistorted waves but approximates the hard-photon propagator and the form factor in the nucleon\ncurrent by evaluating them at the effective momentum, qef f . Tests of the EMAr against the full\nDWBA analysis were carried out for the response function of the 1s shell of\n\n27\n\n208 Pb.\n\nThose tests\n\n\f-1\n\n-1\n\n(Z /\u03c3M) d\u03c3/d\u03a9d\u03c9 (GeV )\n\n8\n\n\u03c3L\n\u03c3T\n\u03c3tot\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n\n\u03c3L\n\nPWIA\n\n\u03c3T\n\nPWIA\n\n\u03c3tot\n\nPWIA\n\n3\n2\n1\n00\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\u03c9 (MeV)\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 13: Ratio of EMAr and PWIA longitudinal, transverse and total cross sections to Z times the Mott\ncross section for 500 MeV electron scattering from\n\n56\n\nF e at q=550 MeV/c.\n\nshowed that the EMAr produces close agreement with the DWBA. Moreover, the assumption\nthat one should remove the nucleon form factor (which is integrated over in the DWBA analysis)\nby evaluating it at qef f was found to be justified with better than 1% accuracy. This should\nbe compared with large differences in cross sections when the form factor is evaluated at q, the\nmomentum transfer of the electron, instead of qef f . We find clear evidence that the form factor\nshould be evaluated at the effective momentum when it is divided out of experimental cross sections\nin order to check the Coulomb sum rule.\nThe analysis of Bates experimental data in Ref. [9] uses the form factor at q rather qef f for a\n40 Ca\n\nnucleus. Results for the Coulomb sum rule are about 0.8-0.9 compared with the expectation\n\nof unity. If qef f were used in the analysis, the Bates results for the Coulomb sum rule would be\nincreased by about 5%, thus making them closer to unity.

[11, 12] uses form factors at qef f . Significantly lower values for the Coulomb sum rule\nare found based on the Saclay analysis. The differences between the Bates and Saclay results are\nmuch larger than can be attributed to Coulomb corrections.\nWe find that the spin phases in electron wave functions produce very small effects at energies\nof 500 MeV or higher. The helicity matrix elements that involve the spin phases are very close\nto those of a PWIA analysis for quasi-elastic scattering. Consequently, the Rosenbluth separation\nexpt\nextracts response functions RL\nand RTexpt that are accurate in the sense that they correspond\n\nvery closely to the distorted wave matrix elements of the longitudinal and transverse parts of the\ncurrents.\nThe effects of the distorted waves on the longitudinal response function are twofold: 1.) for\nelectron scattering they shift the peak of the response functions towards larger values of the energy\n\n29\n\n\f8\n\n-1\n\nSL (GeV )\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0.0\n\n0.1 0.2\n\n0.3 0.4\n\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 15: EMAr longitudinal response functions divided by Z and the nucleon form factor for\n\n56\n\nFe at Ei\n\n= 500 Mev and q = 550 MeV/c (solid line) and at Ei = 800 Mev and q = 900M eV /c (dashed line). The\ncorresponding PWIA response functions without Coulomb effects included are shown by the light dashed\nlines. Fits of the response functions using Eq. (3) are shown by the \u00d7 symbols and values of the fitting\nparameters are given in Table IV.\n\nloss, \u03c9, and 2.) they distort the shapes of the response functions, more so for the inner shells\nthan the outer ones. However, reasonably accurate fits of the distorted response functions can be\nobtained using the EMA fitting procedure of Eq. (3). The momentum shift parameter \u03b4k is found\nto be given by fEM A \u2248 0.80, for both the\n\n208 P b\n\nand\n\n56 F e\n\nnuclei, i.e., \u03b4k \u2248 0.80Vc (0), where Vc (r)\n\nis the Coulomb potential. More precise values are given in Table IV. The normalization parameter\nA is equal to 1.00 within one or two percent. The uncertainty arises because the normalization\nfor the sum over shells has been calculated based on the full DWBA for the 1s-shell of\n\n208 P b\n\nand\n\nbecause the shape of the distorted response function differs a little from the shape of the PWIA\nresponse function for \u03c9 significantly away from the peak. Therefore fits to the PWIA shape cannot\nreproduce the response precisely. Note that the good agreement of fEM A and A for 208 Pb and 56 Fe\ndemonstrates that the Coulomb corrections do not depend significantly on the nuclear model. Note\nalso that the analysis of experimental data using a fit as in Eq. (3) tends to give more accurate\n(P W IA)\n\nresults for RL\n\nat the peak of the response because that is controlled by \u03b4k and less accurate\n30\n\n\fresults away from the peak because of the distortion of the shape.\nEstimates of longitudinal, transverse and total cross sections have been calculated using shell\nmodel wave functions for 208 P b and 56 F e at q = 0.55 GeV/c and q = 0.8 GeV/c. These kinematical\nconditions match the ones used in a recent experiment at Jlab. Because final-state interactions,\ncorrelations and pion production have been omitted, the calculated cross sections may differ significantly from experimental cross sections. Nevertheless the Coulomb corrections should be reliable\nat the level of a few percent.\nCoulomb corrections are notoriously difficult to calculate and our calculations refute claims\nthat may be found in the literature. For example, Ref. [46] claims that the EMA procedure is not\naccurate for the longitudinal response at 485 electron energy and 60o scattering angle for a\n\n208 P b\n\ntarget. The basis for the claim is that significant differences are found between EMA results and\nresults based on an ad-hoc DWBA analysis that has been used extensively. We find that the EMA\nwith appropriate parameters can describe the 1s-shell DWBA or all-shells EMAr results very well\nat essentially the same kinematics. We wish to emphasize that all of our numerics are under good\ncontrol and various consistency checks have been made that give confidence in the results reported\nherein.\n\n[1] R.
