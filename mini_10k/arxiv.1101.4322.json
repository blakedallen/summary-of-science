For any group G, we use:\n(1) G\u2032 to denote the commutator subgroup [G, G] of G,\n(2) Z(G) to denote the center of G, and\n(3) \u03a6(G) to denote the Frattini subgroup of G.\nFor a, b \u2208 G, we use ab to denote the conjugate b\u22121 ab.\nNotation.

In the proof of our main result, we may assume p \u2265 5, for otherwise\neither:\n\u2022 |G| = 54 is of the form 18q, where q is prime, so [6, Prop. 9.1] applies, or\n\u2022 |G| = 34 is a prime power, so the main theorem of [8] applies.\n2. Assume the Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal\nNotation. Let:\n\u2022 G be a group of order 27p, where p is prime, and p \u2265 5 (see Remark 1.9),\n\u2022 S be a minimal generating set for G,\n\u2022 P \u223c\n= Zp be a Sylow p-subgroup of G,\n\u2022 w be a generator of P , and\n\u2022 Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G\n(2.1) Assumption. In this section, we assume that P is a normal subgroup of G.\nTherefore G is a semidirect product:\nG = Q \u22c9 P.\n\u2032\n\nWe may assume G is not cyclic of prime order (for otherwise Theorem 1.1 applies).\nThis implies Q is nonabelian, and acts nontrivially on P , so\nG\u2032 = Q\u2032 \u00d7 P is cyclic of order 3p.\nNotation. Since Q is a 3-group and acts nontrivially on P \u223c\n= Zp , we must have\np \u2261 1 (mod 3).

A lemma that applies to both of the possible Sylow 3-subgroups.\nThere are only 2 nonabelian groups of order 27, and we will consider them as\nseparate cases, but, first, we cover some common ground.\n(2.2) Note. Since Q is a nonabelian group of order 27, and G = Q \u22c9 P \u223c\n= Q \u22c9 Zp ,\nit is easy to see that\nQ\u2032 = \u03a6(Q) = Z(Q) = Z(G) = \u03a6(G).\n(2.3) Lemma. Assume\n\u2022 s \u2208 (S \u222a S \u22121 ) \u2229 Q, such that s does not centralize P , and\n\u2022 c \u2208 CQ (P ) r \u03a6(Q).\nThen we may assume S is either {s, cw} or {s, c2 w} or {s, scw} or {s, sc2 w}.\nProof. Since G/P \u223c\n= Q is a 2-generated group of prime-power order, there must be\nan element a of S, such that {s, a} generates G/P . We may write\na = si cj zwk ,\n\nwith 0 \u2264 i \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2, z \u2208 Z(Q), and 0 \u2264 k < p.\n\nNote that:\n\u2022 By replacing a with its inverse if necessary, we may assume i \u2208 {0, 1}.\n\n\f4\n\nEBRAHIM GHADERPOUR AND DAVE WITTE MORRIS\n\n\u2022 By applying an automorphism of G that fixes s and maps c to cz j , we may\n2\nassume z is trivial (since (cz j )j = cj z j = cj z).\nk\n\u2022 By replacing w with w if k 6= 0, we may assume k \u2208 {0, 1}.\nThus,\na = si cj w k\n\nwith i, k \u2208 {0, 1} and j \u2208 {1, 2}.\n\nCase 1. Assume k = 1. Then hs, ai = G, so S = {s, a}. This yields the four listed\ngenerating sets.\nCase 2. Assume k = 0. Then hs, ai = Q, and there must be a third element b of S,\nwith b \u2208\n/ Q; after replacing w with an appropriate power, we may write b = tw with\nt \u2208 Q. We must have t \u2208 hs, \u03a6(Q)i, for otherwise hs, bi = G (which contradicts the\nminimality of S). Therefore\n\u2032\n\nt = si z \u2032 with 0 \u2264 i\u2032 \u2264 2 and z \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6(Q) = Z(G).\nWe may assume:\n\u0001\n\u2022 i\u2032 6= 0, for otherwise b = z \u2032 w \u2208 S \u2229 Z(G) \u00d7 P , so Lemma 1.3 applies.\n\u2022 i\u2032 = 1, by replacing b with its inverse if necessary.\n\u2022 z \u2032 6= e, for otherwise s and b provide a double edge in Cay(G/P ; S), so\nCorollary 1.5 applies.\nThen s\u22121 b = z \u2032 w generates Z(G) \u00d7 P .\nConsider the hamiltonian cycles\n(a\u22121 , s2 )3 ,\n\n\u0001\n(a\u22121 , s2 )3 #, b ,\n\nand\n\n(a\u22121 , s2 )3 ##, b2\n\n\u0001\n\nin Cay(G/hz, wi; S). Letting z \u2032\u2032 = (a\u22121 s2 )3 \u2208 hzi, we see that their endpoints in G\nare (respectively):\nz \u2032\u2032 ,\n\nz \u2032\u2032 (s\u22121 b) = z \u2032\u2032 z \u2032 w,\n\nand\n\nz \u2032\u2032 (s\u22121 b)s (s\u22121 b) = z \u2032\u2032 (z \u2032 )2 ws w.\n\nThe final two endpoints both have a nontrivial projection to P (since s, being a\n3-element, cannot invert w), and at least one of these two endpoints also has a\nnontrivial projection to Z(G). Such an endpoint generates Z(G) \u00d7 P = hz, wi, so\nthe Factor Group Lemma (1.4) provides a hamiltonian cycle in Cay(G; S).\n\u0003\n2B. Sylow 3-subgroup of exponent 3.\n(2.4) Lemma. Assume Q is of exponent 3, so\nQ = h x, y, z | x3 = y 3 = z 3 = e, [x, y] = z, [x, z] = [y, z] = e i.\nThen we may assume:\n(1) wx = wr , but y and z centralize P , and\n(2) either:\n(a) S = {x, yw}, or\n(b) S = {x, xyw}.\nProof. (1) Since Q acts nontrivially on P , and Aut(P ) is cyclic, but Q/\u03a6(Q) is\nnot cyclic, there must be elements a and b of Q r \u03a6(Q), such that a centralizes P ,\nbut b does not. (And z must centralize P , because it is in Q\u2032 .) By applying an\nautomorphism of Q, we may assume a = y and b = x. Furthermore, we may assume\nwx = wr by replacing x with its inverse if necessary.\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPHS OF ORDER 27p ARE HAMILTONIAN\n\n5\n\n(2) S must contain an element that does not centralize P , so we may assume\nx \u2208 S.

Assume Q is of exponent 9, so\nQ = h x, y | x9 = y 3 = e, [x, y] = x3 i.\nThere are two possibilities for G, depending on whether CQ (P ) contains an element\nof order 9 or not.\n(1) Assume CQ (P ) does not contain an element of order 9. Then we may\nassume y centralizes P , but wx = wr . Furthermore, we may assume:\n(a) S = {x, yw}, or\n(b) S = {x, xyw}.\n(2) Assume CQ (P ) contains an element of order 9. Then we may assume x\ncentralizes P , but wy = wr . Furthermore, we may assume:\n(a) S = {xw, y},\n(b) S = {xyw, y},\n(c) S = {xy, xw}, or\n(d) S = {xy, x2 yw}.\nProof. (1) Since x has order 9, we know that it does not centralize P . But x3 must\ncentralize P (since x3 is in G\u2032 ). Therefore, we may assume wx = xr (by replacing x\nwith its inverse if necessary). Also, since Q/CQ (P ) must be cyclic (because Aut(P )\nis cyclic), but CG (P ) does not contain an element of order 9, we see that CQ (P )\ncontains every element of order 3, so y must be in CQ (P ).\nSince S must contain an element that does not centralize P , we may assume\nx \u2208 S. By applying Lemma 2.3 with s = x and c = y, we see that we may assume\nS is:\n{x, yw} or {x, y 2 w} or {x, xyw} or {x, xy 2 w}.\nThe second generating set need not be considered, because (y 2 w)\u22121 = yw\u22121 = yw\u2032 ,\nso it is equivalent to the first. Also, the fourth generating set can be converted into\nthe third, since there is an automorphism of G that fixes y, but takes x to xyw and\nw to w\u22121 .\n(2) We may assume x \u2208 CQ (P ), so CQ (P ) = hxi.\nWe know that S must contain an element s that does not centralize P , and there\nare two possibilities: either\n(I) s has order 3, or\n(II) s has order 9.\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPHS OF ORDER 27p ARE HAMILTONIAN\n\n7\n\nWe consider these two possibilities as separate cases.\nCase I. Assume s has order 3. We may assume s = y. Letting c = x, we see from\nLemma 2.3 that we may assume S is either\n{y, xw} or {y, x2 w} or {y, yxw} or {y, yx2 w}.\nThe second and fourth generating sets need not be considered, because there is an\nautomorphism of G that fixes y and w, but takes x to x2 . Also, the third generating\nset may be replaced with {y, xyw}, since there is an automorphism of G that fixes y\nand w, but takes x to y \u22121 xy.\nCase II. Assume s has order 9. We may assume s = xy. Letting c = x, we see\nfrom Lemma 2.3 that we may assume S is either\n{xy, xw} or {xy, x2 w} or {xy, xyxw} or {xy, xyx2 w}.\nThe second generating set is equivalent to {xy, xw}, since the automorphism of G\nthat sends x to x4 , y to x\u22123 y, and w to w\u22121 maps it to {xy, (xw)\u22121 }. The third\ngenerating set is mapped to {xy, x2 yw} by the automorphism that sends x to x[x, y]\nand y to [x, y]\u22121 y. The fourth generating set need not be considered, because xyx2 w\nis an element of order 3 that does not centralize P , which puts it in the previous\ncase.\n\u0003\n(2.7) Proposition.

Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since\nno odd prime divides 3\u22121 or 32 \u22121, and 13 is the only odd prime that divides 33 \u22121,\nSylow's Theorem [4, Thm. 15.7, p. 230] implies that p = 13, and that NG (P ) = P ,\nso G must have a normal p-complement [3, Thm. 7.4.3]; i.e., G = P \u22c9 Q. Since\nP must act nontrivially on Q (since P is not normal), we know that it must act\nnontrivially on Q/\u03a6(Q) [3, Thm. 5.3.5, p. 180]. However, P cannot act nontrivially\non an elementary abelian group of order 3 or 32 , because |P | = 13 is not a divisor of\n3 \u2212 1 or 32 \u2212 1. Therefore, we must have |Q/\u03a6(Q)| = 33 , so Q must be elementary\nabelian (and the action of P is irreducible).\nLet W be the matrix representing the action of w on (Z3 )3 (with respect to\nsome basis that will be specified later). In the polynomial ring Z3 [X], we have the\nfactorization:\n(3.2)\n\nX 13 \u2212 1\n= (X 3 \u2212 X \u2212 1) * (X 3 + X 2 \u2212 1)\nX \u22121\n* (X 3 + X 2 + X \u2212 1) * (X 3 \u2212 X 2 \u2212 X \u2212 1).\n\nSince w13 = e, the minimal polynomial of W must be one of the factors on the\nright-hand side. By replacing w with an appropriate power, we may assume it is\nthe first factor. Then, choosing any nonzero v \u2208 (Z3 )3 , the matrix representation\n2\nof w with respect to the basis {v, v w , v w } is W (the Rational Canonical Form).\nNow, let \u03b6 be a primitive 13th root of unity in the finite field GF(27). Then\nany Galois automorphism of GF(27) over GF(3) must raise \u03b6 to a power. Since\nthe subgroup of order 3 in Z\u00d7\n13 is generated by the number 3, we conclude that the\norbit of \u03b6 under the Galois group is {\u03b6, \u03b6 3 , \u03b6 9 }. These must be the 3 roots of one of\nthe irreducible factors on the right-hand side of (3.2). Thus, for any k \u2208 Z\u00d7\n13 , the\nmatrices W k , W 3k , and W 9k all have the same minimal polynomial, so they are\nconjugate under GL3 (3). That is:\n\n(3.3)\n\npowers of W in the same row of the\nfollowing table are conjugate under GL3 (3):\n\nW, W 3 , W 9\nW 2, W 5, W 6\nW 4 , W 12 , W 10\nW 7 , W 8 , W 11\n\n\u223c P . Then a has order p, so,\nThere is an element a of S that generates G/Q =\nreplacing it by a conjugate, we may assume a \u2208 P = hwi, so a = wi for some\ni \u2208 Z\u00d7\n13 . From (3.3), we see that we may assume i \u2208 {1, 2} (perhaps after replacing\na by its inverse).\nNow let b be the second element of S, so we may assume b = wj v for some j.\nWe may assume 0 \u2264 j \u2264 6 (by replacing b with its inverse, if necessary). We may\nalso assume j 6= i, for otherwise S \u2282 aQ, so Theorem 1.8 applies.\nIf j = 0, then (i, j) is either (1, 0) or (2, 0), both of which appear in the list;\nhenceforth, let us assume j 6= 0.\nCase 1. Assume i = 1. Since j 6= i, we must have j \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\nNote that, since W 3 is conjugate to W under GL3 (3) (since they are in the same\n\u0001\nrow of (3.3)), we know that the pair (w, w4 ) is isomorphic to the pair w3 , (w3 )4 =\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPHS OF ORDER 27p ARE HAMILTONIAN\n\n11\n\n(w3 , w\u22121 ). By replacing b with its inverse, and then interchanging a and b, this is\ntransformed to (w, w3 ). So we may assume j 6= 4.\nCase 2. Assume i = 2. We may assume W j is in the second or fourth row of the\ntable (for otherwise we could interchange a with b to enter the previous case. So\nj \u2208 {2, 5, 6}. Since j 6= i, this implies j \u2208 {5, 6}. However, since W 5 is conjugate\nto W 2 (since they are in the same row of (3.3)), and we have (w2 )3 = w6 and\n(w5 )3 = w2 , we see that the pair (w2 , w6 ) is isomorphic to (w2 , w5 ). So we may\nassume j 6= 6.\n\u0003\n(3.4) Proposition. If |G| = 27p, where p is prime, and the Sylow p-subgroups\nof G are not normal, then Cay(G; S) has a hamiltonian cycle.\nProof. From Lemma 3.1 (and Remark 1.9), we may assume G = Z13 \u22c9 (Z3 )3 . For\neach of the generating sets listed in Lemma 3.1, we provide an explicit hamiltonian\ncycle in the quotient multigraph P \\Cay(G; S) that uses at least one double edge.\nSo Lemma 1.7 applies.\nTo save space, we use i1 i2 i3 to denote the vertex P (i1 , i2 , i3 ).\n(i, j) = (1, 0) a = w, a\u22121 = w12 , b = (1, 0, 0),\nDouble edge: 222 \u2192 022 with a\u22121 and b\nb\u22121\n000
