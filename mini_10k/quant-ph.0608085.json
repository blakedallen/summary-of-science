Distilling such states would require true multi-qubit state distillation methods.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nStabilizer operations, consisting of Clifford group unitaries and Pauli operator measurement and\neigenstate preparation, suffice for generating interesting, highly entangled quantum states. By the\nGottesman-Knill theorem, however, they are efficiently classically simulatable and not quantum\nuniversal [AG04]. What more does one need to obtain quantum universality? A sufficient additional operation is any one-qubit unitary that is not a Clifford up to overall phase [Shi03]. Almost\nevery n-qubit unitary also suffices. Much less is known, however, about which non-unitary quantum\nchannels, such as noisy gates, suffice for universality together with stabilizer operations. If we assume that the quantum operations are under the adaptive control of a universal classical computer,\nthen this question turns out to be a special case of a broader problem:\nMagic states distillation problem. For which quantum states \u03c1 does stabilizer operations plus\nrepeated preparation of \u03c1 imply quantum universality?\nIf repeated preparation of \u03c1 and stabilizer operations gives universality, we say for short U(\u03c1).\nThe problem of characterizing the states \u03c1 for which U(\u03c1) holds has its main application in quantum\nfault tolerance. For fault-tolerance schemes based on stabilizer codes, encoded stabilizer operations\nare the easiest operations to implement. Magic states distillation allows extending these operations\n\u2217\n\nSchool of Computer Science and Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo.\n\n1\n\n\fto a full universal set, provided that noisy enough states \u03c1 satisfy U(\u03c1). Conversely, limits on when\nU(\u03c1) can hold can also give limits on fault-tolerance schemes.\nIn this paper, we extend the range of single-qubit mixed states \u03c1 that are known to give universality, by using a simple parity-checking operation. However, the question of fully characterizing\nthose single-qubit states \u03c1 for which U(\u03c1) holds remains open. For multi-qubit pure states, the\nquestion U(\u03c1)? reduces to the same question for single-qubit pure states. Unfortunately, though,\nas a second result we show that this question for mixed multi-qubit states \u03c1 generally does not\nreduce to the single-qubit problem. We also study the applications of magic states distillation to\nquantum fault-tolerance schemes. In particular, these applications in practice will require certain\nstability properties, and we present a stable distillation procedure.\n\n1.1\n\nSingle-qubit magic states distillation\n\nBravyi and Kitaev [BK05] posed and studied the magic states distillation problem for single-qubit\nstates \u03c1. Single-qubit states are conveniently parametrized by the Bloch sphere of Figure 1, under\n\u0001\nthe correspondence\n(x, y, z) \u2194 \u03c1(x, y, z) = 12 (I + xX + yY + zZ). Here X = ( 01 10 ), Y = 0i \u2212i\n0 ,\n\u0001\n0\nZ = 10 \u22121\nare the Pauli matrices. Bravyi and Kitaev proved that certain \u03c1 can be efficiently\ndistilled with stabilizer operations to be arbitrarily close to the state |Hi := cos \u03c08 |0i + sin \u03c08 |1i \u2194\n( \u221a12 , \u221a12 , 0). Knill, Laflamme and Zurek [KLZ98] proved U(|Hi). Combining these results gives:\nTheorem 1 ([BK05]). U(\u03c1) holds for single-qubit states \u03c1(x, y, z) with\nor\n\nmax{|x| + |z|, |x| + |y|, |y| + |z|} > 1.015\n\u221a\n|x| + |y| + |z| > 3/ 7 \u2248 1.134 .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nOn the other hand, it is obvious that U(\u03c1) does not hold for \u03c1(x, y, z) with |x| + |y| + |z| \u2264 1, as\nsuch states are convex combinations of the Pauli eigenstates {(\u00b11, 0, 0), (0, \u00b11, 0), (0, 0, \u00b11)}. Such\nstates we call \"stabilizer states,\" since they can be prepared using stabilizer operations.\nThus Theorem 1 leaves a gap in between the stabilizer states and the known distillable states.\nWhat happens in the region between them? Non-adaptive stabilizer operations alone compute\nthe class \u2295L, so are probably not universal even for classical computation [AG04]. One intriguing\npossibility is that stabilizer operations with states \u03c1(x, y, z) outside the region of Theorem 1 but\nwith |x| + |y| + |z| > 1 could give an intermediate class between BPP and BQP. Another possibility\nis that there is a sharp threshold, i.e., that U(\u03c1(x, y, z)) holds exactly when |x| + |y| + |z| > 1.\nIn fact, Ref. [Rei05] showed that there is indeed a sharp threshold in the xz-plane of the Bloch\nsphere:\nTheorem 2 ([Rei05]). U(\u03c1(x, y, z)) holds if\nmax{|x| + |z|, |x| + |y|, |y| + |z|} > 1 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe improvement of Eq. (3) over Eq. (1) is tight, as the states \u03c1(x, 0, 1 \u2212 x) are stabilizer states.\nTheorem 2 also implies:\nCorollary 1 ([Rei05]). U(\u03c1) holds for every single-qubit pure state \u03c1 that is not one of the six\nPauli eigenstates.\nPure states correspond to points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, i.e., x2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1.\nIn this paper, we extend the set of single-qubit states \u03c1 for which we know U(\u03c1) slightly further:\n2\n\n\fz\n|0!\n|H!\n|0!\u2212i|1!\n\u221a\n2\n\n|0!\u2212|1!\n\u221a\n2\n|0!+i|1!\n\u221a\n2\n\n|0!+|1!\n\u221a\n2\n\ny\n\nx\n\n|1!\nFigure 1: Bloch sphere: Up to a phase, single-qubit states are in correspondence with points on or in\nthe unit sphere in R3 . The state \u03c1(x, y, z) = 12 (I +xX +yY +zZ) corresponds to the point (x, y, z).\nPure states correspond to points on the surface of the sphere. All points \u03c1 in the octahedron O the\nconvex hull of the six Pauli eigenstates can be prepared using stabilizer operations.\nTheorem 3. U(\u03c1(x, y, z)) holds if\np\np\np\nmax{|x| + y 2 + z 2 , |y| + x2 + z 2 , |z| + x2 + y 2 } > 1 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe basic operation required is a simple parity check, which we introduce in Section 2. Applying\nthe parity check in the computational and dual bases, in Section 3, gives the stated improvement\nin the distillable region of states.\nMoreover, we show in Section 4 that the set of distillable states is strictly larger than the set\ndelimited by Eqs. (2) and (4):\nTheorem 4. U(\u03c1(f x, f y, f z)) holds for x = y =\nf = 0.9895.\n\n\u221a\n3 7\u22127\n\u221a\n7(2\u2212 2)\n\n\u2248 0.229, z =\n\n\u221a\n14\u22123\u221a14\n7(2\u2212 2)\n\n\u2248 0.677 and\n\nNotice that the values of (x, y, z) in Theorem 4 satisfy Eqs. (2) and (4) with equality, so\n(f x, f y, f z) is a slight but strict improvement. The proof of Theorem 4 comes from a small\nmodification of Bravyi and Kitaev's distillation scheme.\nFigure 2 displays the new distillable state results.\n\n1.2\n\nMulti-qubit state distillation\n\nIn [Rei05], this author considered the question U(\u03c1)? for multi-qubit pure states. For every multiqubit pure state that is not a stabilizer state, there exists a sequence of stabilizer operations that\nreduces the state down to a single-qubit pure state that is not a Pauli eigenstate. From Corollary 1,\nthis implies:\n\n3\n\n\f(a)\n\nx+y =1\n0.5\n\nx+\n\n(b)\n\n!\ny2 + z2 = 1\n\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1\n\n\u221a\nx + y + z = 3/ 7\n\n0.4\n\nx=y\nx+y+z =1\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\np\n\n!\n\nx2 + y 2 + z = 1\nx+z =1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n(c)\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nz\n\nFigure 2: Open region: In (a) is shown the region of single-qubit states for which\nU(\u03c1) had not been\n\u221a\nknown, bounded in one octant of the Bloch sphere by 1 < x + y + z \u2264 3/ 7 and max{x + y, y +\nz, x + z} \u2264 1.

This curve has been computed numerically, and we do not know a parametric form.\n\n4\n\n\fCorollary 2 ([Rei05]). U(\u03c1) holds for every single- or multi-qubit pure state that is not a stabilizer\nstate.\nCorollary 3. Almost every n-qubit unitary, together with stabilizer operations, gives quantum\nuniversality.\nCorollary 3 follows from Corollary 2 by applying the unitary to |0n i; the result will almost certainly\nnot be a stabilizer state, since there are a finite number of pure n-qubit stabilizer states.\nWe here study distillation of two-qubit mixed states. We provide an example of a two-qubit\nstate that is not a mixture of stabilizer states, but for which every two-to-one-qubit stabilizer\nreduction outputs a mixture of stabilizer states (Section 5). This implies that, unlike the situation\nfor pure states, the question of U(\u03c1)? for mixed states does not reduce to the single-qubit case.\n\n1\nTheorem 5. The state \u03c1 = 14 II + 12\n(IY + IZ \u2212 XX + Y X + ZX) is not a mixture of stabilizer\nstates, but every two-to-one-qubit stabilizer reduction outputs a mixture of single-qubit stabilizer\nstates.\n\nTheorem 5 is proved by studying the 15-dimensional polytope of two-qubit stabilizer states.\nHowever, the problem of multi-qubit magic states distillation is still mostly open; for example, we do\nnot know if U(\u03c1) holds for the \u03c1 of Theorem 5, nor do we know of any two-qubit distillation procedure\nthat cannot start with reduction to a one-qubit state. Dennis has previously considered distillation\nof a two-qubit state for universality [Den01]. However, for the state, \u221a13 (|00i+|01i+|10i), and noise\nmodel in [Den01], as well as for simultaneous depolarizing noise, universality does reduce to the\nsingle-qubit case. Below the noise level at which the state becomes a mixture of stabilizer states,\nuniversality can be obtained by measuring the second qubit to be |+i and applying Theorem 2.\n\n1.3\n\nState distillation and quantum fault tolerance\n\nThis magic states distillation problem is natural from a quantum information point of view, with the\nmotivation coming from understanding the gap between classically controlled stabilizer operations\n(BPP) and full quantum universality (BQP). The main application, though, is to lower and upper\nbounds for quantum fault tolerance (Section 7).\nMagic states distillation serves as a reduction from universal fault-tolerant computation down\nto fault-tolerant stabilizer operations. This reduction often works in practice without affecting the\nmaximum tolerable noise rate, or threshold, because the bottleneck is in achieving reliable stabilizer\noperations.\nDetermining upper bounds on the tolerable noise threshold is a difficult problem. We show that\ntwo recent upper bounds [VHP05, BCL+ 06], based on upper-bounding the amount of noise before a\ngate set becomes classically simulatable by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, are unfortunately tight.\nFor example,\nTheorem 6. Classically controlled stabilizer operations, together with repeated application of a \u03c0/8\ngate (exp(i \u03c08 Z)) subject to worst-case probabilistic noise at rate p (or dephased at twice that rate),\ngive universality if and only if p < \u221a12 (1 \u2212 \u221a12 ).\nClassically controlled stabilizer operations, together with repeated\napplication of a \u03c0/8 gate de\u221a\npolarized at rate p, give universality if and only if p < (6 \u2212 2 2)/7.\n\nThe two \"only if\" parts of Theorem 6 are proved by [VHP05] and [BCL+ 06], respectively. The\nfirst \"if\" part is a consequence of Theorem 2. We prove the second \"if\" part by distilling a certain\ntwo-qubit state, based on the Jamiolkowski isomorphism.\n5\n\n\f2\n\nUniversality of stabilizer operations and preparation of |Hi\n\nThis section reviews the proof from Refs. [KLZ98, BK05] of U(|Hi) and introduces the paritychecking operation used in Section 3 to implement an improved magic states distillation procedure. This scheme is similar to the partner-pairing algorithm used in heat-bath algorithmic\ncooling [FLMR04].\nDefinition 1. Stabilizer operations consist of Clifford group unitaries, preparation of |0i and\nmeasurement in the computational\n|0i, |1i basis. Clifford group unitaries are generated by the\n\u0001\n1 , the phase gate Z 1/2 = ( 1 0 ) and the controlled-NOT gate, CNOT\nHadamard gate H = \u221a12 11 \u22121\n0 i\n|ai|bi = |ai|a + b mod 2i for a, b \u2208 {0, 1}.\nThe CNOT gate and arbitrary single-qubit rotations from SU (2) give universality [BBC+ 95],\nfrom which Boykin et al. proved the universality of CNOT, Hadamard, and Z 1/4 [BMP+ 00]. The\nintuition is that using Z 1/4 and its stabilizer conjugates, like X 1/4 , it is easy to obtain a rotation\nby an irrational multiple of \u03c0 about some axis, and hence a dense set of rotations about that axis.\nRotations about a second axis can be obtained by conjugation with a stabilizer operation.\nThe proof of U(|Hi) follows from a trick to implement exp(i \u03c62 Z) on a data qubit using repeated\npreparation of exp(i \u03c62 Z)|+i and stabilizer operations with adaptive classical control. Here |+i =\n\u221a1 (|0i + |1i) is +1 eigenstate of X.\n2\nSingle qubit pure states can be parameterized by polar coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6) on the Bloch sphere:\n|\u03c8(\u03b8, \u03c6)i = cos 2\u03b8 |0i + ei\u03c6 sin 2\u03b8 |1i, so |Hi = |\u03c8(\u03c0/4, 0)i. Single qubit Clifford unitaries consist\nexactly of the rotational symmetries of the octahedron O of Figure 1, so in particular |\u03c8(\u03b8, 0)i and\n|\u03c8( \u03c02 , \u03b8)i are symmetrical. Now notice that\n(\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i) \u2297 (|0i + ei\u03b8 |1i) = \u03b1|00i + \u03b2ei\u03b8 |11i + \u03b1ei\u03b8 |01i + \u03b2|10i\n\n(5)\n\nby simply expanding out the tensor product. Therefore, we can apply a CNOT\nbetween the qubits\n\u0001\nto measure the parity. On measuring even parity, the operation 10 e0i\u03b8 has been applied to the\n\u0001\n0\nremaining qubit. When the parity is odd, 10 e\u2212i\u03b8\nhas been applied. In the latter case, we repeat\nthe process, carrying out a random walk on phases that are integer multiples of \u03b8. Terminate the\nwalk when the phase is +\u03b8. Note the necessity of adaptive classical control of the quantum circuit.\n\u03c0\nThis procedure in particular implements Z 1/4 \u221d ei 8 Z given repeated preparation of |Hi, giving\nquantum universality U(|Hi). In this case, a random walk is actually not necessary; on measuring\nodd parity, apply the correction Y 1/2 . In fact, Shi has extended [BBC+ 95] to show universality of\n{CN OT, T }, where T is any single-qubit real gate such that T 2 does not preserve the computational\nbasis [Shi03]. This implies U(|\u03c8(\u03b8, 0)i) for almost all \u03b8.\n\n3\n\nParity-checking distillation algorithm\n\nThe same parity-checking operation can be applied to single-qubit mixed states.\n\n6\n\n\f3.1\n\nCase y = 0\n\nFirst, assume that the y coordinate is zero. Taking two copies of \u03c1(x, 0, z),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2\n2\n\u03c1(x, 0, z) \u2297 \u03c1(x, 0, z) =\n\n1\n4\n\n(1+z) x(1+z) x(1+z) x\nx(1+z)\n1\u2212z 2\nx2\nx(1\u2212z) \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nx(1+z) x2\n1\u2212z 2 x(1\u2212z)\nx2\nx(1\u2212z) x(1\u2212z) (1\u2212z)2\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nA successful parity check extracts the 2 \u00d7 2 submatrix of the first and last rows and columns.\nRenormalizing this submatrix to have trace one, and converting back into (x, y, z) Bloch sphere\ncoordinates,\n2z\nx2\n(7)\n(x, 0, z) 7\u2192 (x0 , 0, z 0 ) = ( 1+z\n2 , 0, 1+z 2 ).\nNow assume additionally that x = z; this can be achieved by applying a Hadamard gate to\n\u03c1 with probability 1/2. Take two output qubits from two separate successful parity checks, and\nperform another parity check in the dual basis, i.e., switching x and z. Then after resymmetrizing\nabout the x = z axis, we get overall\n(x, 0, x) 7\u2192\n\nx2 (3+x2 )\n(1, 0, 1)\n1+2x2 +2x4\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nIt is simple to verify that this function lies above x for 1/2 < x . 0.68. Repeatedly apply this\nscheme to iterate Eq. (8), in each step pairing together successful states from the previous iteration,\nand conditioning on success of\n\u221a all the measurements. The states output by this procedure will not\napproach |Hi (at x = y = 1/ 2 \u2248 0.71). However, since 2 * 0.68 > 1.015, we can use Theorem 1 to\nobtain universality. This provides a new proof of Theorem 2.\nThe procedure above is equivalent to taking four copies of \u03c1 and conditioning the state to lie\nin the logical subspace of the four-qubit erasure code. In Ref. [Rei05], Theorem 2 is proved by\nusing the seven-qubit Steane and 23-qubit Golay codes similarly. This scheme is simpler, but less\nefficient and can only distill |Hi indirectly.\nThere are a various related distillation schemes. For example, instead of dual-parity-checking\ntwo copies of the parity check's output, one can dual-parity-check \u03c1 and the parity check's output-\nequivalent to distillation with a certain three-qubit code. We have checked by exhaustive enumeration all three-to-one- and four-to-one-qubit distillation protocols, and these schemes appear to be\noptimal, insofar as they maximize x0 + z 0 starting from x = z = 21 + 0.001.\n\n3.2\n\nCase y 6= 0\n\nNext consider the case when initially y 6= 0. Of course, symmetrizing about the Hadamard axis\nforces y to 0, but we would like to do better. With a single postselected parity check,\n2\n2\n1\n(x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x0 , y 0 , z 0 ) = 1+z\n2 (x \u2212 y , 2xy, 2z) .\np\n\u0001\nTo understand Eq. (9), reparametrize to r = x2 + y 2 , \u03c6 = arctan(y/x), z . Then since\n\ny 0 /x0 =\n\n2xy\n= tan 2\u03c6 ,\nx2 \u2212 y 2\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\na postselected parity check accomplishes the mapping\n\n2\n\nr\n2z\n(r, \u03c6, z) 7\u2192 (r0 , \u03c60 , z 0 ) = ( 1+z\n2 , 2\u03c6, 1+z 2 ) .\n\n7\n\n(11)\n\n\fThus, r and z transform just as x and z do in the case y = 0; but also the angle \u03c6 doubles. Now\nif \u03c6 = k\u03c0/2l for integers k, l, then repeated doubling will eventually move the state into the y = 0\nplane. Now, as long as\np\nr + z = x2 + y 2 + z > 1 ,\n(12)\none can verify with straightforward calculus that\n\nr0 + z 0 > 1 .\n\n(13)\n\nTherefore, once the state reaches the y = 0 plane, it will satisfy x + z > 1, so Theorem 2 applies.\nUnfortunately, this method is very inefficient, since the difference r0 + z 0 \u2212 1 can be quadratically\nsmaller than r + z \u2212 1.\nFor most states, of course, \u03c6 \u2208\n/ {k\u03c0/2l : k, l \u2208 Z}. However, since we are dealing with mixed\nstates, there is a simple solution. We can create any state \u03c10 within the octahedron O, by preparing\nthe Pauli eigenstates with the appropriate probabilities. The set of \"nice\" longitudinal angles\n{k\u03c0/2l : k, l \u2208 Z} is dense. So we can certainly choose a \u03c10 (in fact, |+i will suffice) and mix it\nwith \u03c1 with appropriate probabilities to generate \u03c10 with a nice longitudal angle and such that the\nnew state still has r0 + z 0 > 1. This proves Theorem 3.\n\n4\n\nFive-qubit distillation procedures\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 1, Bravyi and Kitaev use a 15-qubit Reed-Muller code [KLZ96] that allows\ntransversal application of exp(i \u03c08 Y ) to prove universality when max{|x| + |z|, |x| + |y|, |y| + |z|} >\n1.015. (This method is actually equivalent to a scheme\ngiven by Knill [Kni04, Rei05].)\n\u221a\nTo prove U(\u03c1(x, y, z)) when |x| + |y| + |z| > 3/ 7, they use stabilizer operations to project five\ncopies of \u03c1 into the codespace of the five-qubit code, with stabilizer generators\nXZZX I , I XZZX,\nX I XZZ, ZX I XZ.\n\n(14)\n\nThey then decode the logical qubit.\nRepeatedly applying\nthis procedure, the state converges\n\u221a\n1 \u221a1 \u221a1\n\u221a\nto |T ihT | = \u03c1( 3 , 3 , 3 ) as long as x = y = z > 1/ 3. Here |T i is the ei2\u03c0/3 eigenstate of\n\u0001\n1+i\n\u25e6\n\u221a1 (1, 1, 1) on the Bloch sphere. In general of course x,\nT = 12 \u22121+i\n\u22121+i \u22121\u2212i , a 120 rotation about\n3\ny and z will be unequal. In that case, first apply single-qubit unitaries to move \u03c1 into the positive\noctant, so x, y, z > 0. Then with equal probabilities 1/3 apply either I, T or T 2 . This symmetrizes\n\u03c1's coordinates.\nA simple modification of the above procedure can give improvements for asymmetric \u03c1. For\nx = y < z, applying T to two of the five copies of \u03c1 before distilling with the\u221afive-qubit code\n(without symmetrizing \u03c1's coordinates) gives an improvement for 0 < x = y < 1/ 3, according to\nnumerical iterations of the equation\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nx3 \u2212 x2 (y 3 + z 3 ) + yz(y + z + 2x \u2212 xyz),\n2\n\uf8f7\n!\uf8ec\n(x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x0 , y 0 , z 0 ) =\n\uf8ed \u2212y 3 + y 2 (x3 + z 3 ) \u2212 xz(x + z + 2y \u2212 xyz),\uf8f8\n4\n4\n4\n1+x +y +z\nz 3 \u2212 z 2 (x3 + y 3 ) + xy(x + y + 2z \u2212 xyz)\n+4xyz(x + y + z)\n(15)\n8\n\n\fTable 1: Seven representative examples of states for which Theorem 5 holds.

There is an improvement between\nx = y = 0.1956 and x = y = z = 1/ 7 \u2248 0.378. In particular, Theorem 4 is one special case.\nWe have exhaustively searched\nall five-to-one-qubit\nstabilizer reductions, evaluating each on\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 7\u22127\n14\u22123\u221a14\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c1( 3 (1, 1, 1)) and \u03c1(x = y = 7(2\u2212 2) , z = 7(2\u2212 2) ), and found no code performed better than the\nfive-qubit code, either alone or with T applied to one or two of the qubits.\n\n5\n\nDistillation of multi-qubit states\n\nThe question U(|\u03c8i)? for multi-qubit pure states |\u03c8i reduces to the same question for single-qubit\npure states [Rei05]. In fact U(|\u03c8i) for all pure states |\u03c8i not stabilizer states, since all nonstabilizer\nsingle-qubit pure states |\u03c8ih\u03c8| have |x| + |y| + |z| > 1. Therefore all nonstabilizer pure states |\u03c8i\ngive universality, U(|\u03c8i).\nA natural question is whether the same type of reduction holds even for mixed states. For\nbrevity, call a state a nonstabilizer state if it is not a mixture of stabilizer states. Given a nonstabilizer multi-qubit mixed state, can it be reduced to a single-qubit nonstabilizer mixed state, using\npostselected stabilizer operations?\nIt turns out that the answer is no. The multi-qubit question for mixed states does not reduce\nto the single-qubit question (Theorem 5). We present examples of nonstabilizer mixed states for\nwhich every two-to-one-qubit stabilizer reduction gives a mixture of stabilizer states. It is not\nknown whether it is possible to achieve universality using these states in some more direct way.\nSeven representative examples are given in Table 1. In this section, we will prove that Theorem 5\nholds for each of these states. They were found by a geometrical argument considering the solid\npolyhedron On of convex combinations of all n-qubit stabilizer states (for n = 2), a generalization\nof the solid octahedron O1 consisting of mixtures of single-qubit stabilizer states.\n\n5.1\n\nStabilizer reductions from n qubits to one qubit\n\nTo begin, we need to characterize the possible ways of using stabilizer operations to reduce an\nn-qubit state down to a single-qubit state. We will show that, without loss of generality, one may\nuse only Clifford group unitaries and postselected Pauli measurements. It cannot be necessary to\n\n9\n\n\fadd ancilla qubits, or to adapt processing according to measurement results.\nLemma 1. For any postselected stabilizer procedure taking \u03c1 an n-qubit state to a one-qubit nonstabilizer state, there exists another procedure taking \u03c1 to a one-qubit nonstabilizer state that consists\nof an n-qubit Clifford unitary, followed by projecting the last n \u2212 1 qubits onto |0n\u22121 i.\nProof. We first remark that without loss of generality all measurements in the reduction procedure\nare postselected. Indeed, if some measurement Mi is not postselected, then the final outcome will\nbe a mixture of the outcome conditioned on an Mi = +1 measurement result and the outcome\nconditioned on Mi = \u22121. If the final outcome is not a mixture of stabilizer states, then at least\none of these conditioned states must not have been.\nTo complete the proof, we must only enforce the assumption that the reduction procedure works\non the n qubits without requiring any extra ancillas. For any procedure using ancillas, there is\nanother procedure that uses no ancillas, and that has identical output on all n-qubit stabilizer\nstates, except possibly with a higher success probability.\nThis fact is a consequence of the Gottesman-Knill stabilizer algebra formalism [Got98]. In order\nto track the evolution of an arbitrary system under stabilizer operations, it suffices to keep track\nof the stabilizer group and logical X and Z values for each of the n unfixed qubits.\nAssume that the procedure has the following form:\n1. In Phase 1, measure certain Pauli operators supported on the n original (logical) qubits.\n(Measuring a Pauli operator P means applying the projection 12 (I + P ).)\n2. Then prepare ancillas |0m i, and in Phase 2 measure Pauli operators acting possibly on all\nn + m qubits.\n3. Finally, apply a Clifford unitary and trace out all but the first qubit.\nThis form may be assumed since applying a unitary U then measuring P , has the same effect as\nmeasuring U \u2020 P U , then applying U .\nNext we show how to either eliminate or move to Phase 1 any measurements in Phase 2.\nAssume that Phase 1 has completed, leaving possibly an arbitrary state on the first n qubits; set\nthe stabilizer group S to be all strings of Z or I supported on the ancilla qubits. Consider the first\nmeasurement in Phase 2, of a Pauli operator P . There are a few cases:\n1. If P or \u2212P is in S, then the measurement either has no effect or succeeds with probability\nzero. Eliminate this measurement.\n2. If the operator P being measured commutes with all the stabilizer group elements but is not in\nthe stabilizer group (P \u2208 N (S)\\S), then there exists Q \u2208 S such that P Q is supported on the\nfirst n qubits. Measuring P Q has the same effect as measuring P . Remove the measurement\nof P from Phase 2 and add a measurement of P Q to Phase 1.\n3. If P anticommutes with a stabilizer group element, then for some ancillary qubit i, Pi \u2208\n{X, Y }. Assume Pi = X; the other case is similar. Then the Pauli P Xi has the identity\non the ith qubit. Consider the unitary U = \u039bi (P Xi ) that applies P Xi controlled by the ith\nqubit. U is a Clifford unitary such that U P U = Xi . Therefore applying U , measuring Xi and\napplying U \u2020 to the result, is equivalent to measuring P . However, applying U has no effect,\nsince the control-qubit is |0i. Therefore, we can simply measure Xi , and delay application of\n10\n\n\fU \u2020 to the end of the protocol, by commuting it past any remaining measurements in Phase 2.\nThis measurement can be eliminated, since preparing |0i and measuring X is the same as\nsimply preparing H|0i = |+i, except with lower success probability.\nThus we may assume that there are no measurements in Phase 2.\nAt the end of Phase 1, there remains at most one degree of freedom in the first n qubits, and\nthis degree of freedom can be isolated with Clifford unitaries involving only those qubits. No extra\nancillas are necessary.\nMoreover, the measurements in Phase 1 can be assumed to all commute with each other. If\nnot, and P and Q are two successive anticommuting measurements, then as above P can be moved\ninto just Zi for some i and Q can be assumed to be Xi . Then measuring Q was unnecessary, for\none could have just applied Hi with the same effect, and higher success probability.\nThe fact that ancilla preparation is unnecessary has two useful consequences. First, this leaves\nonly a finite number of different stabilizer operations that can be applied to reduce an n-qubit state\ndown to a single-qubit state. In our proof we will consider up to symmetries an exhaustive list of all\npossible stabilizer operations reducing two qubits to one. Second, it implies that a counterexample\nfor n = 2 also gives a counterexample for n > 2; take the same state but adjoin |0n\u22122 i. If the\noriginal state is not a mixture of stabilizer states, then nor is the n-qubit state-any such mixture\nwould need to be trivial on the last n \u2212 2 qubits. If no algorithm using stabilizer operations reduces\nthe two-qubit state to a nonstabilizer single-qubit state, then the same will be true for the n-qubit\nstate because it can in particular be prepared from the two-qubit state with ancilla preparation.\n\n5.2\n\nPolyhedron On of mixtures of n-qubit stabilizer states\n\nAny n-qubit density matrix \u03c1 can be written as a real combination of the n-qubit Pauli operators,\nwith the coefficient of a Pauli P given by cP (\u03c1) = 21n Tr(P \u03c1). The coefficient of I is fixed to 1/2n\nn \u2212 1 coordinates can vary. The state stabilized by the stabilizer\nsince Tr \u03c1 = 1, but the other 4P\ngroup S has density matrix 21n S\u2208S S, i.e., it has coordinates 1/2n for S \u2208 S and 0 elsewhere.\nLemma 2.

The factor 16 arises because choosing one nontrivial element of the\nstabilizer group to be, say, logical +X overcounts by six.\n\nWe are interested in convex combinations of stabilizer states. For n = 1, mixtures of the six\nstabilizer states form the closed, solid octahedron O1 in three dimensions, shown fitting within the\nBloch sphere in Figure 1. For n = 2, O2 has 60 vertices in a 15-dimensional space (Figure 3).\nNotice that n-to-1-qubit stabilizer reductions are linear from the original (4n \u2212 1)-dimensional\nspace into the four-dimensional space with basis I, X, Y, Z-the coordinate for the identity I is\nincluded because the trace of the output is not necessarily one without nonlinear renormalization.\nTherefore, the set of n-qubit states mapped into O1 by a given stabilizer reduction is convex.\n\n5.3\n\nCounterexamples for n = 2\n\nSpecialize now to n = 2. Let us show that none of the states in Table 1 are stabilizer states, and\nthat for each of them every two-to-one-qubit stabilizer reduction gives a stabilizer state.\nEvery face of O2 has at least 15 vertices. Each of the counterexamples in Table 1 comes from\nfinding a face F of O2 such that for every stabilizer reduction to a single qubit, F is not mapped\nto a face of the cone of O1 . That such faces of O2 can be found intuitively seems quite reasonable.\nIndeed, the alternative would be that, for every face, all 15 or more vertices are mapped to only\nfour vertices in the output, three vertices of O1 plus possibly 0. For, if a fourth vertex of O1 is in\nthe image, then necessarily two vertices must oppose one another and cancel out, so the image of\n\n12\n\n\fTable 2: Inequalities defining seven faces of the two-qubit stabilizer polyhedron O2 .

Intuitively, this alternative possibility seems unlikely. However, it can in fact occur\nfor some faces of O2 ; see Eq. (22) below.\n5.3.1\n\nCounterexamples lie outside O2\n\nIn order to prove that a certain state \u03c1 is nonstabilizer, we need to check that \u03c1 is indeed a valid\ndensity matrix, and also need to exhibit a separating hyperplane, i.e., an inequality satisfied by\nevery stabilizer state but violated by \u03c1. In Table 2, we list seven inequalities satisfied by each of\nthe 60 two-qubit stabilizer states, but violated by the respective states of Table 1. To verify this,\ncompute inner products of the inequality with the state coordinates.\n5.3.2\n\nCounterexamples reduce to mixtures of single-qubit stabilizer states\n\nNext, we claim that for each counterexample from Table 1, indeed every two-to-one-qubit stabilizer\nreduction outputs a mixture of stabilizer states. This can be checked by enumeration, since by\nLemma 1 there are only a finite number of stabilizer reductions that need to be considered. In fact,\nthere are exactly 30 stabilizer reductions to check. Each reduction corresponds to measuring one of\nthe 15 nontrivial two-qubit Pauli operators, postselecting on outcome \u00b11. This leaves one degree\nof freedom uniquely defined up to single-qubit stabilizer operations.\nOf course, these checks can easily be done on a computer, but it is worth understanding the\nalgebra involved. We will give a simple example that should elucidate the general situation.\n1\nConsider, e.g., the state \u03c1 = 14 II + 12\n(IY + IZ \u2212 XX + Y X + ZX). On measuring ZZ,\npostselecting on a +1 outcome, the unnormalized state becomes\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n1\nXY + Y X)\n2 (II + ZZ)\u03c1 2 (II + ZZ) = 8 II + ZZ + 3 (IZ + ZI \u2212 XX + Y Y +\n\u0001\n(19)\n= 14 12 (II + ZZ) II + 13 (IZ \u2212 XX + XY ) .\n\nApplying a CNOT from the first qubit into the second in order to remove the fixed ZZ stabilizer,\nthe state becomes 41 (I \u2212 13 (X + Y + Z)) \u2297 21 (I + Z). And indeed, the sum of the absolute values of\nthe X, Y, Z components of the first qubit equals the I component, so the first qubit is a mixture of\nstabilizer states.\n\n13\n\n\fWe could have shortened the above calculation. Notice that IZ, ZI, XX, \u2212Y Y , XY , Y X\nare the nontrivial two-qubit Paulis commuting with ZZ, besides ZZ itself. Then compare \u03c1's\ncoordinates cII + cZZ to\n|cIZ + cZI | + |cXX \u2212 cY Y | + |cXY + cY X | .\n\n(20)\n\nBoth equal 1/4.\nThe general procedure follows immediately; we need to compare the sums of the absolute\nvalues of the appropriate averages of the coordinates of \u03c1, where the averages are over the Paulis\ncommuting with the measured operator P and differing by P . For example, projecting \u03c1 by\n1\n2 (II \u2212 Y Z), we need to compare cII \u2212 cY Z to\n|cXX \u2212 cZY | + |cXY + cZX | + |cIZ \u2212 cY I | .\n\n(21)\n\nOne notices from these calculations an interesting property of \u03c1. Let S be the set of nontrivial\nPaulis P such that cP (\u03c1) 6= 0. Then,\n1. No two elements of S commute.\n2. The difference between any two elements of S commutes with neither.\n3. Exactly three elements of S commute with any nontrivial Pauli outside S.\nThe first property implies that after measuring any element of S and postselecting on either +1\nor \u22121, the remaining degree of freedom is a fully mixed state-since the relevant sum of averaged\ncoordinates is zero. The second property, which is a consequence of the first property, implies\nthat after measuring a Pauli P not in S, it is impossible to have both cQ and cP Q nonzero for Q\n1\n1\n1\ncommuting with P . Therefore, the relevant comparison gives 41 \u2265 12\n+ 12\n+ 12\n, so the reduced state\nlies inside O1 . In fact, the third property implies that it lies on the boundary of O1 .\nThus, these properties of \u03c1 suffice to prove that any two-to-one-qubit stabilizer reduction on\n\u03c1 outputs a mixture of stabilizer states. We do not know of similarly concise proofs for the other\nstates in Table 1, but the calculation of course still reduces to summing averages of coordinates as\nin Eq. (20).\n5.3.3\n\nStructure of O2 by computer analysis\n\nThe counterexamples from Table 1 were found by using the cdd software for polyhedral computations [Fuk]. On input the 60 two-qubit stabilizer states, cdd outputs the 22,320 external faces of\ntheir polyhedral convex hull. Most of these faces are symmetrical under two-qubit Clifford operations; to determine a minimum set of representatives, we repeatedly chose a random two-qubit\nClifford and reduced the faces modulo that symmetry. After a small number of iterations, only\neight faces remained. Seven of these are those displayed in Table 2, and the eighth is given by\n1\n4\n\nTr \u03c1(\u2212II + IX + IY + IZ + XI \u2212 XX \u2212 XY \u2212 XZ) \u2264 0 .\n\n(22)\n\nNone of these remaining faces are symmetrical to each other, because two-qubit Cliffords can only\npermute their coordinates by conjugation, possibly also changing the sign \u00b11 of a coordinate.\nTherefore, no two inequalities with differing II coordinates can be symmetrical to each other. The\ninequality of Eq. (22) and the first inequality of Table 2 cannot be symmetrical to each other\n14\n\n\fsince they have a different number of nonzero coordinates. No two of the inequalities in Table 2\nwith II coordinate of \u22122 can be symmetrical since they either have different numbers of nonzero\ncoordinates or have coordinates with different magnitudes.\nNext we chose an element in the center of each face and pushed it out from 41 II as far as\npossible such that every two-to-one stabilizer reduction still outputted only stabilizer mixtures.\nThis procedure worked for all the hyperplanes except that of Eq. (22). For the state in the center\nof this face, there does exist a two-to-one reduction leading to a state lying on the boundary of O1\nwith equal x, y, z coordinates. Since we do not know the limits of distillation in this direction, it is\nunknown if applying this reduction to a state moved slightly outward leads to universality.\n\n5.4\n\nDirect distillability of multi-qubit states\n\nWe have not shown that the states in Table 1 cannot be distilled to give universality, only that\nsuch a distillation procedure could not start by reducing from two qubits to one. What more can\nbe said about these examples, particularly the first one, having the most apparent structure?\nFor more than two qubits, the calculation of whether or not the output lies inside O1 still\nsimplifies to an equation like Eq. (20), except within each of the three terms we average over a set\nof 2n\u22121 coefficients. We have checked by exhaustive enumeration of all size-eight abelian subgroups\nof the Paulis on four qubits that for none of the states in Table 1 do two copies allow a reduction\nto a nonstabilizer state. We have also verified this for several pairs of different states from Table 1.\nUnfortunately, this does not come close to proving that U(\u03c1) is false for any of these states.\nCurrently there are essentially almost no nontrivial upper bounds on the power of magic states\ndistillation even in the single-qubit case. The only exception, to the author's knowledge, is recent\nwork by Campbell and Browne [CB09]. They show that for any fixed x, y, z > 0, and any fixed\nstabilizer code, there exists an \u000f > 0 such that the distillation procedure based on this code fails\n1+\u000f\nfor states \u03c1(f x, f y, f z) when |f | \u2264 x+y+z\n. The possibility remains, though, that \u000f approaches 0 as\nthe code size increases.\nAn interesting special case of the multi-qubit magic states distillation problem is the distillability\nof unentangled states. Say that we are allowed to prepare copies of each of a set of states \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1k .\nWhen do we have U(\u2297i \u03c1i )? As a simple example, say we can prepare both \u03c1(x, y, z) and \u03c1(x, \u2212y, z).\nReflection across the xz plane is not a stabilizer operation, so these two states are generally not\nequivalent under stabilizer operations. Now letting \u03a0even = |00ih00| + |11ih11|,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1+z)2 x2 +y 2\n\u03a0even (\u03c1(x, y, z) \u2297 \u03c1(x, \u2212y, z))\u03a0even = 41 x2 +y2 (1\u2212z)2\n(23)\n2z\nr2\n,\n0,\n)\n,\n\u221d \u03c1( 1+z\n2\n1+z 2\nwhere r2 = x2 + y 2 . Thus immediately the y coordinate is zeroed out, and we essentially\nhave\np\nEq. (7)pwith r in place of x. Thus directly U(\u03c1(x, y, z) \u2297 \u03c1(x, \u2212y, z)) provided max{ x2 + y 2 +\nz, x + y 2 + z 2 } > 1.\n\n6\n\nDistillation of unknown states\n\nNote that the success of the method for proving Theorem 3 depends strongly on us knowing the\nstate \u03c1 exactly, and that precisely the same state can be prepared repeatedly. Any small errors\nwill be amplified quickly in the angle-doubling step. These assumptions are very strong, and\n15\n\n\fare probably not physically justified. For practical applications, the definition of U(\u03c1) should be\nrevisited to incorporate other conditions, including stability. The exact conditions may depend\non the application. For example, in the threshold proof for concatenated distance-three codes in\nRef. [Rei06b], dealing with the possibility of asymmetrically erroneous states requires:\nTheorem 7. For any constant \u03b4 > 0, perfect stabilizer\nwith adaptive classical control,\u0001\n\u221a operations\n\u221a\n\u221a\ntogether with the ability to prepare states \u03c1i = \u03c1(fi / 3, fi / 3, fi / 3) = 12 I + \u221afi3 (X + Y + Z)\np\nwith each fi unknown but at least (1 + \u03b4) 3/7, gives quantum universality.\n\nThus it is enough to have lower bounds on the fidelities of the prepared states with |T i, and\nthe states need not be identical. Moreover, in this case, the bound on the allowed error rate turns\nout to be the same for these nonidentical states as for the identical states assumed in Theorem 1.\nNote that some assumptions that are impractical at the physical level become relevant at the\nencoded level, when we try to apply magic states distillation on top of a stabilizer operation faulttolerance scheme. An example is the assumption of perfect stabilizer operations. See Section 7.1.\nAdditionally, it might not be surprising that the distillation model becomes more delicate as the\nlimits of distillation are approached. Even delicate, artificial models can be of interest when we use\nmagic states distillation to consider noise threshold upper bounds, in Section 7.2. Still, it is possible\nthat the current techniques are unnecessarily fragile, and that there exist more direct, practical and\nefficient methods.\nProof of Theorem 7. Theorem 7 is an extension of Theorem 1, from [BK05]. It is based on the\nsame five-qubit code distillation scheme discussed in Section 4. Denote by [f ]s the symmetric sum\nof s-tuples of the variables f1 , . . . , f5 , i.e.,\nX\nY\n[f ]s \u2261\nfi .\n(24)\nS\u2286{1,2,3,4,5} i\u2208S\n|S|=s\n\nTake five prepared states, \u22975i=1 \u03c1i , and use stabilizer operations to project into the codespace of\nthe five-qubit code, then decode the logical qubit. A simple calculation gives that the probability\nof success is\n\u0001\n1\npsuccess = 48\n3 + [f ]4 .\n(25)\nThe x, y, z coordinates of the output state, conditioned on success, are the same, equal to\n\u0001\n1\n1 \u22121\n\u221a *\n[f ]3 \u2212 2[f ]5 .\n3 psuccess 48\n\n(26)\n\nThese coordinates are negative, but can be\u221arotated \u221aback to \u221a\nthe positive octant with a stabilizer\noperation. Then the output state is \u03c1(fout / 3, fout / 3, fout / 3), where\nfout =\n\n[f ]3 \u2212 2[f ]5\n.\n3 + [f ]4\n\n(27)\n\nNow note that psuccess is monotonely increasing in each fi , so distillation remains efficient when\nthe fi are unequal.\nAlso, simple algebra gives that \u2202fout /\u2202fi > 0, so improving any of the input fidelities can only\nimprove the output fidelity. Indeed, differentiate fout with respect to f5 \u2013 other derivatives are\n16\n\n\frelated by symmetry. Use the quotient rule d(a/b) =\nnot involve f5 , is, after simplifications,\n\n1\n(b da\nb2\n\n\u2212 a db). The numerator, which does\n\n\u0001\nf1 f2 3 \u2212 f1 f2 f3 f4 \u2212 f3 f4 \u2212 31 f1 f2 f32 f42 \u2212 31 f1 f2 (f32 + f42 ) + symmetrical terms .\n\n(28)\n\nEach term is nonnegative when the fi \u2208 [0, 1], implying that fout is monotone in each fi .\n\nThe assumption of Theorem 7, that each prepared \u03c1i has equal x, y, z coordinates, can be\nguaranteed by randomly applying I, T , or T 2 each with probability 1/3 independently to each\nprepared \u03c1i . However, the ability to apply perfect Clifford unitaries may not imply the ability to\napply a random perfect Clifford unitary. Depending on the application, this symmetrization may\nnot be innocuous.\nFor example, one important class of schemes for achieving fault tolerance is based on postselection [Kni05, Rei06a, AGP08, Rei09]. In such schemes one can apply stabilizer operations to\nencoded qubits. These operations can be made arbitrarily accurate, but only conditioned on some\nheralded random event. That is, after trying to applying to apply an operation, the experimenter\nreceives a message whether or not the operation succeeded. The details are not important here.\nThe problem, though, is that the success probability can depend on the operation being applied.\nThus, if we try to apply I, T , or T 2 each with probability 1/3, there is no guarantee that the\nprobabilities conditioned on success will also be each 1/3.\nNow the fact that there is a working scheme for distilling \u03c11 \u2297* * *\u2297\u03c1n that starts by applying I, T\nor T 2 at random to each qubit implies that there exists some fixed sequence of unitaries U1 \u2297* * *\u2297Un\nthat works at least as well. If we knew this sequence, we would have no need to randomize.\nUnfortunately, this sequence a priori could depend on the states \u03c1i in an arbitrary manner. Without\nknowing the states exactly, therefore, we cannot derandomize the distillation scheme. In fact,\nthough, Ref. [Rei09] shows that the |T i-state distillation scheme can be derandomized, albeit at a\ncost:\nTheorem 8 ([Rei09, Theorem 1]). There exists a constant \u000f > 0 such that perfect stabilizer operations with adaptive classical control, together with the ability to prepare (unknown) states \u03c1i each\nwith fidelity \u2265 1 \u2212 \u000f with |T i, gives quantum universality.\nMore explicitly, \u03c1i = \u03c1(xi , yi , zi ), a sufficient condition for quantum universality is that for\neach i,\n\b\nmax max | \u221a13 \u2212 xi |, | \u221a13 \u2212 yi |, | \u221a13 \u2212 zi | \u2264 0.0527 .\n(29)\ni\n\nIn fact, by considering a decoding circuit for the five-qubit code, Ref. [Rei09] shows that not all\nstabilizer operations are necessary for simulating universal quantum computation. In Theorem 8,\nit suffices to have the operations CNOT, Hadamard, preparation of |0i and measurement in the\n|0i, |1i basis.\nIn the next section, we will summarize applications of magic states distillation to quantum faulttolerance schemes. For lower bounds on the fault-tolerance threshold, statements like Theorem 7\nor Theorem 8 are typically needed. For placing limits on upper bounds, though, i.e., on attempts\nto prove the impossibility of reliable quantum computation at high noise rates, theorems such as\nTheorem 1, Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, which assume the state \u03c1 is known exactly and can be\nprepared repeatedly, are still of use.\n\n17\n\n\fX\nZ\n\nFigure 4: Knill's method for achieving universality by teleporting into an encoding. If the X and\nZ measurements are not postselected, then a logical correction (not shown) might be required.\n\n7\n\nFault-tolerance applications\n\nThe main application of magic states distillation is to fault-tolerant quantum computing, or reliable\ncomputing in the presence of noisy gates. In particular, it clearly addresses the problem of achieving\nuniversality using noisy ancilla preparation. It does assume perfect stabilizer operations, though,\nwhich is certainly not realistic. This assumption can be justified in two different contexts:\n1. Certain arguments for upper-bounding the tolerable noise rate (or \"threshold\") assume that\nstabilizer operations are perfect and only the extra operation required for universality is noisy.\nThis is optimistic, but sufficient for an upper bound. Section 7.2 below considers the relationship\nof magic states distillation to these arguments.\n2. Assumptions, like perfect stabilizer operations, which are unrealistic at the physical level can\nsometimes be justified at higher levels of encoding in a fault-tolerant concatenated coding scheme.\nIn particular, it is possible that there are two different noise thresholds, one threshold for reliable\nstabilizer operations and a separate threshold for reliable universal quantum computation. If the\nphysical noise is below the threshold for reliable stabilizer operations, then we can assume that\nstabilizer operations are in fact perfect-not at the physical level, but at some level of encoding.\n\n7.1\n\nFault-tolerance threshold lower bounds and estimates\n\nAssuming perfect stabilizer operations, magic states distillation gives universality by using noisy,\nsingle-qubit ancilla states. However, these noisy ancillas need to be prepared not at the physical\nlevel, but at the same higher level of encoding at which the logical stabilizer operations are reliable.\nHow can one reliably encode noisy ancillas? Following Knill [Kni04, Kni05], we use perfect\nencoded stabilizer operations to create an encoded Bell pair \u221a12 (|00iL + |11iL ) (the subscript L\n\ndenoting \"logical\"). Then we decode one half from the bottom up, ideally obtaining \u221a12 (|0i|0iL +\n|1i|1iL ). Then prepare a qubit in a \"magic\" state like |Hi or |T i and teleport it into the encoding,\nusing a physical CNOT gate and two single-qubit measurements. See Figure 4. If there is no noise,\nthen the output state will be |HiL or |T iL . At that point, both stabilizer operations and ancilla\npreparation can be done at an encoded level, so encoded universality follows.\nIn the presence of noise, the noise too will be teleported into the encoding, i.e., into logical\nnoise. As long as it is not too high, it can be distilled away at the encoded level, using (perfect)\nencoded stabilizer operations. This noise can come from three places: noise in the prepared singlequbit ancilla, noise in the physical teleportation circuit, and noise in the decoded half of the Bell\npair. As long as the total noise from these sources is not too large, magic states distillation will\nsucceed.\np Fortunately, magic states distillation can tolerate very high amounts of noise-for example,\n1\n(1\n\u2212\n3/7) \u2248 17.2% depolarizing noise on |T i, by Theorem 1. Therefore, it often turns out that\n2\n18\n\n\fthe threshold for universal quantum computation is the same as that for just stabilizer operations.\nThe bottleneck is in achieving reliable stabilizer operations.\nThis is a useful technique because it is easier to prove a noise threshold for stabilizer operations\nalone than for a full universal scheme. For fault-tolerance schemes using quantum stabilizer codes,\nonly physical stabilizer operations are required to achieve reliable encoded stabilizer operations.\nStabilizer operations are easy to work with because Pauli errors propagate through them linearly.\nMoreover, these operations can be simulated efficiently, by the Gottesman-Knill theorem-meaning\nthat we can run classical simulations to estimate the fault-tolerance threshold for stabilizer operations. Steane and Knill, among many others, have run extensive simulations of this type to\ndetermine threshold estimates [Ste03, Kni05].\nThreshold proofs and estimates simplify using this reduction because magic states distillation\nlets us skip the fault-tolerance hierarchy for universal quantum computing operations. That is,\nwith a concatenated-coding fault-tolerance scheme, stabilizer operations at k levels of encoding are\nimplemented in terms of stabilizer operations at k \u2212 1 levels of encoding. Typically, the additional\noperation needed to obtain universality is also implemented at level k in terms of the same operation\nand stabilizer operations at level k \u2212 1. Using magic states distillation, though, we can instead\nobtain universality at level k using only level-k stabilizer operations and some sort of universality\noperation at level 0, in this case, certain noisy ancilla preparations.\nThis reduction, from universal fault tolerance to stabilizer operation fault tolerance, does not\nnecessarily always work, because it requires that we be able to decode one half of an encoded Bell\npair without introducing too much noise. It is possible that we can prepare a perfect encoded Bell\npair but cannot decode half of it without losing control of the noise. In the schemes that have\nbeen studied [Kni05, Rei06b], however, this has not seemed to happen. The decoding operation\nwas straightforward to analyze rigorously in Ref. [Rei06b] because decoding blocks independently\ncannot create correlated errors, which are the main obstacle to proving a threshold for stabilizer\noperations.\nThere are different tricks that might be useful, too, in decoding a state; for example, instead of\ncorrecting any detected errors, one might postselect on no detected errors. If any errors are detected,\nthen throw the Bell pair away and start over. This can adversely impact the overhead if applied\ninjudiciously, but it might be a reasonable technique to apply in a limited fashion. For example, in\na recursive decoding scheme, one might only postselect on no detected errors in decoding the last\nfew levels.\nSome technical concerns arise in applying magic states distillation to fault-tolerance. For example, besides knowing U(\u03c1), we are also interested in the stability of the procedure, either because\nwe cannot repeatedly prepare exact copies of \u03c1 or perhaps because our knowledge of \u03c1 has limited\naccuracy [Rei06b]. These concerns are addressed by Theorem 7 and Theorem 8.\nFinally, note that while fault-tolerance schemes often use concatenated coding, and magic states\ndistillation can also be phrased as projection into a certain code space, the two codes need bear no\nrelationship to each other.\n\n7.2\n\nFault-tolerance threshold upper bounds\n\nGiving upper bounds for the fault-tolerance threshold, with a given set of operations and a given\nnoise model, is difficult. There have been only a few approaches, and these tend to be tied delicately\nto a particular model. For example, Aharonov et al. show that a useful noisy quantum circuit\ncan only have logarithmic depth if fresh ancillas are not allowed to be introduced during the\n19\n\n\fcomputation [ABO96, ABOIN96]. In practical quantum computing schemes, though, it is possible\nto initialize ancillas during the computation. Razborov shows that the tolerable noise rate, of\ncircuits with more than logarithmic depth, can be at most 1/2 for a gate set with gates of fan-in\ntwo [Raz04]. This approach does not allow for noiseless classical control based on measurement\nresults, though, which is common in proposed experimental implementations of quantum computers.\nMoreover, interesting problems, including factoring, can be solved with logarithmic-depth quantum\ncircuits, aided by classical computation [CW00].\nHarrow and Nielsen [HN03] ask how much depolarizing noise can be tolerated by a two-qubit\ngate before it loses its power to generate entanglement; they find that the CNOT is the most resilient\ntwo-qubit gate, but does not tolerate independent depolarizing noise higher than 74%. (Virmani,\nHuelga and Plenio improve this to 2/3 with a more careful entanglement requirement [VHP05].)\nAgainst simultaneous depolarizing noise, they find that the threshold is at most 8/9, or 1/2 for a\nsomewhat-adversarial noise model, an optimal noise process including correlated two-qubit noise.\nVirmani et al. [VHP05] assume that stabilizer operations, including the CNOT gate, are perfect,\nand ask how much noise can be tolerated\u221ain an additional\ngate used to achieve universality. They\n\u221a\nshow that the \u03c0/8 gate, exp(i \u03c08 Z), with ( 2 \u2212 1)/2 2 \u2248 14.6% or more worst-case noise, or twice\nthat amount of dephasing noise, becomes a convex combination of stabilizer operations and so this\ngate set can be simulated classically. Among all the rotations exp(i 2\u03b8 Z), the \u03c0/8 gate is the most\nresistant to dephasing noise according to their criterion. The advantage of this approach, and also\nthat of Harrow and Nielsen, is that it easily allows for the incorporation of noiseless classical control\ninto the model.\nBuhrman et al. extend these results to a depolarizing noise channel [BCL+ 06]. Again, assume\nthat stabilizer operations are perfect, and assume that \u221a\na noisy single-qubit gate is used to achieve\nuniversality. They show that the \u03c0/8 gate with (6 \u2212 2 2)/7 \u2248 45.3% or more depolarizing noise\nbecomes a convex combination of stabilizer operations. And again, the \u03c0/8 gate is the most noiseresistant single-qubit gate. Therefore, 45.3% is an upper bound on the noise threshold in this\nmodel.\nMagic states distillation (Theorem 6) shows the limit of the techniques of [VHP05, BCL+ 06].\nBoth their upper bounds are tight; with any less noise one gets universal quantum computation.\nSince from Section 7.1 we typically expect the threshold bottleneck to be in achieving perfect\nstabilizer operations, this may not be very surprising.\nProof of Theorem 6. The upper bounds\nare\u221adue to [VHP05, BCL+ 06].\n\u221a\nThe \u03c0/8 gate with less than ( 2 \u2212 1)/2 2 worst-case probabilistic noise, or twice that amount\nof dephasing noise, takes |+i to a state \u03c1(x, x, 0) with x > 1/2, implying universality together with\nperfect stabilizer operations by Theorem 2.\nThe \u03c0/8 gate with 45% depolarizing noise, however, takes |+i to a state well inside the octahedron O1 of Figure 1. Instead, inspired by the Jamiolkowski isomorphism, apply the noisy gate to\nthe second\nhalf of a Bell pair, which is a stabilizer state. If the depolarizing noise rate is less than\n\u221a\n(6 \u2212 2 2)/7, then the output two-qubit state lies outside of O2 (defined in Section 5.2). Moreover,\nthere does exist a two-to-one-qubit stabilizer reduction giving a state outside O1 ; simply apply the\nparity-check procedure\nof Section 2. Indeed, the renormalized output state at a depolarizing noise\n\u221a\nrate of (6 \u2212 2 2)/7 \u2212 \u000f is computed to have x, y, z coordinates of\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a1\n(1\n+\n2\n,\n(30)\n2)(2\n+\n7\u000f),\n\u22122\n2(1\n+\n2\n2\n+\n7\u000f),\n0\n10+6 2+21\u000f\nfor which |x| + |y| > 0 when \u000f > 0. By Theorem 2, this state gives universality.\n20\n\n\fThere are a number of questions still to answer about these threshold upper bound results. We\nwill just list a few of them:\n1. Assume E is a partly depolarized single-qubit unitary E(\u03c1) = (1 \u2212 p)U \u03c1U \u2020 + p I2 Tr \u03c1 (or,\nP\nmore generally, a mixture of unitaries E(\u03c1) = i pi Ui \u03c1Ui\u2020 ), but is not a mixture of Cliffords.\nDoes E together with stabilizer operations suffice for achieving universality? Certainly simply applying E to a single-qubit Pauli eigenstate may not suffice, for it could create, e.g.,\n\u03c1(x, y, z) with x = y = z \u2208 ( 13 , \u221a17 ] which we do not know not how to distill. None of the\ncounterexamples from Section 5 can be written as a single-qubit unitary on a stabilizer state\nfollowed by depolarizing noise.1 Note that the last six elements in Figure 3 correspond to the\n24 single-qubit Clifford unitaries under the Jamiolkowski isomorphism, up to sign/syndrome\nchoices.\nFor a noisy gate E, stabilizer operations with adaptive classical control and E gives universality\nif and only if U((1 \u2297 E)(|\u03a8ih\u03a8|)) for |\u03a8i = \u221a12 (|00i + |11i). Indeed, the \"if\" direction is by\ndefinition of U(\u03c1). Only if: E being universal with stabilizer operations implies that we can\nefficiently approximate |T i to arbitrary accuracy, i.e., using poly(log(1/\u03b4)) gates to obtain\nprecision \u03b4. In particular, we can get within a constant of |T i using only a constant number of\napplications of E. Now assume we have only stabilizer operations and repeated preparation\nof \u03c1 = (1 \u2297 E)(|\u03a8ih\u03a8|). In our approximate preparation of |T i, replace every application\nof E by teleportation into \u03c1, conditioning each measurement outcome so no correction is\nrequired. Since the success probability of each teleportation is 1/4 and only a constant\nnumber of teleportations are required, the expected overhead is a constant. Once we have an\napproximation of |T i, we obtain universality by distilling it, e.g., using Theorem 7.\n\nIn fact, if E is the \u03c0/8 gate with depolarizing noise, this equivalence is much simpler; teleporting into (1 \u2297 E)(|\u03a8ih\u03a8|) can be accomplished deterministically. Since the \u03c0/8 gate is in\nC3 , the set of operators that conjugate Paulis to Cliffords, any required correction is always\na Clifford and can be applied [GC99]. The depolarizing noise commutes past the correction.\nTherefore, without loss of generality we may assume that E is applied to the second half\nof |\u03a8i. But can one always distill the resulting state by first applying a two-to-one-qubit\nstabilizer reduction?\n2. If we do not assume perfect CNOT gates, then can we reduce the amount of error allowed\non the single-qubit gate, such as a \u03c0/8 gate? This is certainly sometimes the case if our\ngate set consists of preparation of noisy ancillas. For example, if the CNOT model is bitwise\nindependent depolarizing channels prior to the CNOT, then we of course will not achieve\nuniversality if the total depolarizing noise on the ancilla moves it into the Bloch sphere. This\ncriterion is probably not tight, however. Can we get similar results for more interesting noise\nmodels, or for the \u03c0/8 gate? Plenio and Virmani have recently studied this problem under\nthe assumption that the fault-tolerance scheme uses the magic state ancillas in a certain\nway [PV08]. They obtain noise threshold upper bounds, subject to this assumption, that are\nremarkably close to estimated threshold lower bounds.\n1\n\nIndeed, each counterexample has a nonzero coordinate for one of IX, IY, IZ, XI, YI or ZI, and it is simple to\nprove that the same is true after applying any two-qubit Clifford-the interesting case is the first example of Table 1.\n\n21\n\n\f8\n\nConclusion\n\nMagic states distillation is important both because it describes the power of stabilizer operations,\nin terms of what more is necessary for achieving full quantum universality, and because of its application to quantum fault tolerance. We have given improved magic states distillation procedures,\nreducing the set of single-qubit mixed states \u03c1 for which U(\u03c1) is unknown. We have also introduced\nthe multi-qubit magic states distillation problem, and proved that it does not reduce to the singlequbit case. We have used magic states distillation to prove that two noise threshold upper bounds\nare in fact tight.\nThere remain many open problems, including most of those described in earlier papers [BK05,\nRei05]. Are there two-qubit nonstabilizer states that cannot be distilled to a single-qubit nonstabilizer state? We have given some candidate states, one of which might have sufficient structure\nfor an analysis. In particular, it is interesting to specialize this question to those two-qubit states\narising from the Jamiolkowski isomorphism.\nResearch conducted while the author was at the University of California, Berkeley, supported\nin part by NSF ITR Grant CCR-0121555, and ARO Grant DAAD 19-03-1-0082.\n\nReferences\n[ABO96]\n\nDorit Aharonov and Michael Ben-Or.
