The results are placed in close comparison with the properties of the\nwell known MQS based on |\u03b1i states. The very critical decoherence properties of the latter MQS are\nfound to be fully accounted for, in a direct a simple way, by a unique \"universal\" function: indeed\na new property of the quantum \"coherent states\".\nPACS numbers:\n\nSince the early decades of Quantum Mechanics, the\ncounter-intuitive properties associated with the coherent\nsuperposition state of macroscopic objects was the object of an intense debate epitomized by the celebrated\n\"Schr\u00f6dinger Cat\" paradox [1, 2]. In particular, the actual feasibility of such quantum object has always been\ntied to the alleged infinitely short persistence of its quantum coherence, i.e. of its overwhelmingly rapid \"decoherence\". In modern times the latter property, establishing\na rapid merging of the quantum rules of microscopic systems into the classical dynamics, has been interpreted as\na consequence of the entanglement between the macroscopic quantum system with the environment [3, 4]. By\ndiscarding the environmental variables in the final calculations the initially pure quantum state generally appears to decay irreversibly towards a probabilistic classical mixture [5]. Recently, the general interest for decoherence has received a renewed interest in the framework of\nquantum information theory where it plays a fundamental detrimental role since it conflicts with the experimental realization of the quantum computer or of any quantum device bearing any useful, relevant complexity [6].\nIn this respect a large experimental effort has been devoted recently to the implementation of Macroscopic (i.e.\nmany-particle) Quantum Superpositions states (MQS),\nadopting photons, atoms and electrons in superconducting devices. Particular attention has been devoted to\nthe realization of the MQS involving \"coherent states\"\nof light, which exhibits interesting and elegant Wigner\nfunction representations [7]. The most notable results of\nthis experimental effort have been reached with atoms\ninteracting with microwave fields trapped inside a cavity\n[8, 9] or for freely propagating fields [10]. However, in\nspite of the long lasting efforts spent in these endeavors,\nin these realizations the MQS has always proved to be so\nfragile that even the loss of a single particle was found to\nbe able to spoil any possibility of a direct observation of\nits quantum properties. Precisely on the basis on these\nnegative results in many scientific communities, and also\nwithin very influential editorial teams, grew the opinion\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\n\u001e\u001f \u0018!\n\n\u0018\u001b \u001c\u001d\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\n\u0001\u0004\u0003\n\u0017\u0011\n\n\u0016\u0017\u0018\u0006\u0019\u0011\u001a\u0014\u0010\u0002\u000f\n\u0003 \u0002 \u000e\u000e\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\u001e\u001f \u0018!\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0001\u0015\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\n\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\n\u0002 \u000e\u000e\u000f\u0006\u0010\u0011 \u0012\u0013\u0002\b\u0014\n\nFIG. 1: Schematization of the decoherence model by a linear\nbeam-splitter of transmittivity T.

Precisely, the MQS\nwas generated by a quantum-injected optical parametric amplifier (QI-OPA) seeded by a single-photon belonging to an EPR entangled pair: indeed a high-gain\nphase-covariant Cloning Machine [12, 13, 14, 15, 17].\nBy this device, that includes an Orthogonality Filter (O-Filter, OF) for better state discrimination, the\nmicroscopic-macroscopic state non-separability was successfully tested and the microscopic-macroscopic Violation of the Bell'inequalities for Spin-1 excitations was attained [11, 16]. It then appears that several prejudices\nabout MQS should need a revision and that a careful\nanalysis looks necessary in order to learn more about the\n\n\f2\nMQS dynamics and its decoherence. The present work is\nprecisely intended to provide a first glimpse in this elusive\nalbeit fundamental matter.\nCriteria for macroscopic superposition: In order to distinguish between two different quantum states,\nlet us introduce a definition of distance in the Hilbert\nspace.

When dealing with the distance amongst\ntwo MQS, we shall also refer to D as the MQS \"Visibility\".\nDistinguishability, MQS Visibility, the lossy\nChannel.\nLet us characterize two macroscopic states |\u03c61 i and |\u03c62 i\n\u221a\u00b1 (|\u03c61 i \u00b1 |\u03c62 i)\nand the corresponding MQS's: |\u03c6\u00b1 i = N\n2\nby adopting two criteria. I) The distinguishability between |\u03c61 i and |\u03c62 i can be quantified as D (|\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i).\nII) The \"Visibility\", i.e. \"degree of orthogonality\" of\nthe MQS's |\u03c6\u00b1 i be expressed again by: D (|\u03c6+ i, |\u03c6\u2212 i).\nIndeed, the value of the MQS visibility depends exclusively on the relative phase of the component states: |\u03c61 i\nand |\u03c62 i. Assume two orthogonal superpositions |\u03c6\u00b1 i:\nD (|\u03c6+ i, |\u03c6\u2212 i) = 1. In presence of losses the relative\nphase between |\u03c61 i and |\u03c62 i progressively randomizes\nand the superpositions |\u03c6+ i and |\u03c6\u2212 i approach an identical fully mixed state leading to: D (|\u03c6+ i, |\u03c6\u2212 i) = 0. The\naim of this paper is to study the evolution in a lossy channel of the phase decoherence acting on two macroscopic\nstates |\u03c61 i and |\u03c62 i and on the corresponding superpositions |\u03c6\u00b1 i and the effect on the size of the corresponding\nD (|\u03c61 i, |\u03c62 i) and D (|\u03c6+ i, |\u03c6\u2212 i).\nThe effects of losses are analyzed through the effect of\na generic linear beam-splitter (BS) with transmittivity\nT and reflectivity R = 1 \u2212 T acting on a generic\nquantum state associated with a single mode beam:\nFig.1 [22]. The procedure for the calculation of the\noutput density matrix is the insertion of the BS unitary\ntransformations as a function of the parameters T or R,\nand the evaluation of the partial trace of the emerging\nfield on the reflected mode (R-trace), i.e. on the loss\nvariables. In this paper we shall study quantitatively\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\u0007\u0003\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\b\n\np\nD(b\n\u03c1, \u03c3\nb) = 1 \u2212 F (b\n\u03c1, \u03c3\nb)\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\n\n\b\n\n0.1\n\nand 0 \u2264 F \u2264 1, where\n\nF = 1 for identical states, and F = 0 for orthogonal\nstates[18].

We are\ngoing to carry out this study for two classes of states\nthat bear a particular relevance in the present context,\nas discussed above in the introductory comments.\nQuantum superposition of coherent states. The\nfirst class of states we are going to analyze is the quantum\nsuperposition of coherent states |\u03c61,2 i = |\u00b1\u03b1i, defined as:\n\u221a\u00b1 (|\u03b1i \u00b1 | \u2212 \u03b1i)[23]. As it is well known, this\n|\u03c8 \u00b1 i = N\n2\nMQS exhibits several very interesting quantum properties, such as squeezing and sub-poissonian statistics and\nhas been so far considered as the paradigmatic representation of the Schr\u0151dinger's cat State.\nSince the BS doesn't affect the poissonian character on the field, the application of the losses model to\nthe input component coherent states | \u00b1 \u03b1i of opposite\nphase leads again to an output\ncoherent-state\ndensity\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmatrix of the form \u03c1bT\u03b1 = | T \u03b1i h T \u03b1|. Then the distance\nwith opposite phase is:\n\u0011 states\n\u0010 \u221a between \u221athe two\n\u221a\nD | T \u03b1i, | \u2212 T \u03b1i = 1 \u2212 e\u22122T |\u03b1|2 , a value close to\n1 except for T = 0, i.e. for total loss of all particles.\nHence the coherent states | \u00b1 \u03b1i keep their mutual distinguishability through the lossy channel.\nLet's now consider the MQS Visibility. Applying the\nprevious losses procedure to the |\u03c8 \u00b1 i states, the density\nmatrices after losses have the general form:\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c1\u0302\u00b1\nC =\n\n\"\n2\n1\"\n|\u03b2i h\u03b2| + | \u2212 \u03b2i h\u2212\u03b2| \u00b1 e\u22122R|\u03b1| (| \u2212 \u03b2i h\u03b2| + |\u03b2i h\u2212\u03b2|)\n2\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nwith |\u03b2i = |\u03b1 T i. For the coherent state MQS with no\nlosses (T = 1), the distribution in the Fock space exhibits\nonly elements with an even number of photons for |\u03c8 + i\nor an odd number of photons for |\u03c8 \u2212 i. This very peculiar\ncomb structure is indeed very fragile under the effect of\nlosses since the R-trace operation must be carried out in\nthe space of the non-orthogonal coherent-states. This is\nshown in Fig.2(a)-(b). Furthermore, Fig.2(c)-(d) shows\nthe effects of decoherence on the |\u03c8 \u00b1 i states for increasing particle loss. The MQS Visibility of these states has\nbeen evaluated analytically in closed form and is found\nextremely sensitive to decoherence [24]:\nq\n\nD=\n\n1\u2212\n\np\n\n1 \u2212 e\u22124R|\u03b1|2\n\n(3)\n\nNote that D(x) depends only on the average number\nof lost photons x \u2261 R|\u03b1|2 = R < n >, for any value of\n< n >. The average loss of 1 photon leads to the MQS\nVisibility value: D = 0.096, and then to the practical\ncancellation of any detectable interference effects involving \u03c1bT\u03c8\u00b1 . This is fully consistent with the experimental\nobservations [8, 9]. The previous calculations can be\ngeneralized to the general coherent state MQS: |\u03c8\u03c6\u00b1 i=\n\u00b1\nN\u03c6\n\u221a\n2\n\n\u0131\u03c6\n\n(|\u03b1e i \u00b1 |\u03b1e\n\n\u2212\u0131\u03c6\n\ni) leading respectively to the distinp\n2\n1 \u2212 e\u22122T |\u03b1|2 sin \u03c6\nguishability: D(|\u03b1e i, |\u03b1e\u2212\u0131\u03c6 i) =\n+\n\u2212\nand to the MQS Visibility: D(|\u03c8\u03c6 i, |\u03c8\u03c6 i)=\nq\np\n2\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 e\u22124R|\u03b1|2 sin \u03c6 .\nWe obtain the previous\nresults by replacing in D(x) the coordinate x by the\nrescaled quantity: x = R|\u03b1|2 sin2 \u03c6. We can summarize\nthe theoretical results for the MQS Visibility by tracing\nthe unique function: D(|\u03c8\u03c6+ i, |\u03c8\u03c6\u2212 i) = D(x), shown in\nFig. 2 (e).We consider this \"universal\" function an\nadditional important property of the \"coherent states\",\nnot previously discovered to the best of our knowledge.\nNote that the function D(x) approaches its minimum\nvalue with zero slope: Sl = limR\u21921 |dD(x)/dx| = 0.\nQuantum superposition by phase-covariant\nquantum cloning.

Due to the linand |\u03a6\u2212 i: |\u03a8\u00b1 i = N\n2\nearity of the amplification process [14], it can be easily found that |\u03a8\u00b1 i = \u03a6R/L . The distribution in the\nFock space P (n\u03a6, n\u03a6\u22a5 ) corresponding to each \"equatorial\" macrostate |\u03a6\u03c6 i, evaluated by Eq.(5) exhibits a\ncomb structure similar to the one shown in Fig.2 (a).\nIndeed only terms with a specific parity, in particular\nwith odd number of photons for ~\u03c0\u03c6 polarization and even\nnumber of photons for its orthogonal\n\b ~\u03c0\u03c6\u22a5 are non vanishing.

Black\nline refers to g = 0.8 and hence to hni \u2248 4, red line to g = 1.1\nand hni \u2248 8, green line to g = 1.3 and hni \u2248 12. b) Numerical evaluation of the Bures distance between two orthogonal\nequatorial macro-qubits for different values of the threshold \u03be\n(g = 0.8).\n\nAs a following step, we have evaluated numerically the distinguishability of {|\u03a6+,\u2212 i} through the\ndistance D(|\u03a6+ i, |\u03a6\u2212 i) between the states: Fig.4(a). It is found that this property of {|\u03a6+,\u2212 i} coincides with the MQS Visibility of |\u03a8\u00b1 i, in virtue of\nthe phase-covariance of the process: D(|\u03a8+ i, |\u03a8\u2212 i)=\nD(|\u03a6R i, |\u03a6L i)= D(|\u03a6+ i, |\u03a6\u2212 i). The visibility of the\nMQS {|\u03a8+,\u2212 i} has been evaluated numerically analyzing D(x) as a function of the average lost photons:\nx \u2261 R < n >. The results for different values of the\ngain are reported in Fig.4-(a). Note that for small values\nof x the decay of D(x) is far slower than for the coherent state case shown in Fig. 2-(e). Furthermore, after\na common inflexion point at D \u223c 0.5 the function D(x)\ndrops to zero for R = 1 and then for: < n > \u223c N , the\ntotal number of particles in the primary beam. Very important, for large < n >, i.e. R \u2192 1 the slope of the\nfunctions D(x) increase fast towards a very large value:\nR \u2192 1: Sl = limR\u21921 |dD(x)/dx| \u2248 \u221e. All this means\nthat the MQS Visibility can be large even if the average\nnumber x of lost particles is close to the total number\nN , i.e. for R \u223c 1. As seen, this behavior is opposite to\nthe case of coherent states where the function D(x) approaches zero value with zero slope: Fig.2(e). We believe\nthat this lucky and quite unexpected behavior is at the\ncore of the high resilience to decoherence of our QI-OPA\nMQS solution. Note that this behavior was responsible\nfor the well resolved interference pattern with visiblity:\nV \u2248 20% obtained in absence of O-Filter (OF) by:[17]\nOrthogonality Filter The demonstration of\nmicroscopic-macroscopic entanglement by adopting the\nO-Filter was reported in [11]. The POVM like technique\n[25] implied by this device locally selects the events\nfor which the difference between the photon numbers\nassociated with two orthogonal polarizations |m\u2212n| > k,\ni.e. larger than an adjustable threshold, k [17]. By this\nmethod a sharper discrimination between the output\nstates |\u03a6\u03c6 i e |\u03a6\u03c6\u22a5 i can be achieved. The action of\n\nthe OF can be formalized\nthrough the measurement\nP\noperator P\u0302OS =\n|m+,\nn\u2212i hm+, n \u2212 |, where\nm,n\nthe sum over m, n extends over the terms for which\nthe above inequality holds. In Fig.4 the results of a\nnumerical analysis carried out for g = 0.8 and different\nvalues of k are reported. Note the the increase of the\nvalue of D(x), i.e. of the MQS Visibility, by increasing\nk and, again: Sl = limR\u21921 |dD(x)/dx| \u2248 \u221e. Of course\nhere the high interference visibility is achieved at the\ncost of a lower success probability, as expected.\nThe present work was intended to give a firm theoretical basis to the very high resilience to decoherence\ndemonstrated in recent experiments by our QI-OPA generated Macroscopic Quantum Superposition. This novel\nMQS system is expected to play a relevant role in the\nfuture investigations on the Foundational structure of\nQuantum Mechanics. We acknowledge useful discussions\nwith Chiara Vitelli.
