Some top-down\nmodels based on topological defects are however compatible with the current data and may\nbe best constrained in the future by the high-energy neutrino flux limit.\n\nIntroduction\nUltra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) raise\na number of observational as well as theoretical problems. While accelerating particles up\nto energies above 1020 eV appears challenging\nin even the most efficient astrophysical accelerators, a large variety of so-called top-down\nmodels have been proposed in which UHECRs are not accelerated from ambient, lowenergy particles, but produced directly at the\nultra-high energy from the decay of putative\nsupermassive particles with masses in excess\nof \u223c 1021 eV. The two main classes of such\nmodels can be considered, with distinct generic\nproperties. The first one involves the decay or\nannihilation of topological defects (TDs) produced through a phase transition in the early\nuniverse [1]. Such events would occur roughly\nhomogeneously throughout the universe, and\ngenerate supermassive particles that would in\nturn decay into quarks and leptons and lead to\nsecondary UHECR protons and photons with\nan energy spectrum and relative abundances\ncharacteristic of the underlying hadronization\nprocess. These UHECRs would then propagate through the universe in much the same\nway as if accelerated by astrophysical sources,\ninteracting with the CMB photons to produce\n\ne+ e\u2212 pairs and pions (in the case of protons)\n\u2013 the so-called GZK effect [2].\nIn the second class of top-down models, the\nsupermassive particles responsible for the observed UHECRs are produced directly in the\nearly Universe [3] and have a lifetime larger\nthen the age of the Universe. An important\nmotivation for such a scenario is that these particles could make up the inferred dark matter\nin the universe, which also provides a natural link between cosmology and UHECRs, allowing one to relate their expected flux to the\nproperties of these super-heavy dark matter\n(SHDM) particles. A key feature of SHDM\nscenarios is that the main contribution to the\nhighest energy cosmic rays observed at Earth\nwould be provided by supermassive particles\nconcentrated in the halo of our Galaxy, so that\npropagation effects (including the GZK suppression of the spectrum) would be supressed\nby the two orders of magnitude [3]. These\nmodels have thus been extensively studied in\nthe context of the report by the AGASA experiment of an excess of UHECR events above\n1020 eV [4]. However, neither the spectrum\nreported by the HiRes experiment (suggesting the presence of the expected GZK suppression [5]) nor the Auger spectrum by themselves\ncan rule out SHDM models.\n\n\fConstraints on top-down models\n100\n\nAUGER ICRC-2007\n\nintegral \u03b3 flux fraction [%]\n\nj(E) E3 [eV2 m-2 s-1 sr-1]\n\nAuger 2007\n1e+24\n\nSHDM \u03b3\nSHDM p+n\n\n1e+23\n\n\u03b3 SHDM E/2\n\nAuger 2006\n\n10\nAuger 2007\n\ntotal\nAuger 2007\nupper bound\nlower bound Ecut=40EeV\nlower bound Ecut=80EeV\nlower bound Ecut=100EeV\n\n1\n1e+19\n\n1e+20\n\n1e+21\n\nE [eV]\n\n10\n\n100\nE [EeV]\n\nFigure 1: a (left): Example of SHDM decay products fit to the Pierre Auger Observatory spectrum.\nSolid line shows the photon flux from SHDM, the dashed line is the SHDM nucleon flux, the dotted\nline is photon flux reconstructed as protons (in approximation E = E\u03b3 /2) and the dot-dashed line\nis the total reconstructed spectrum from SHDM. b (right): Corresponding photon fraction in\npercentage of the total UHECR spectrum integrated above energy E.

[6]. A review of previous UHE photon limits can be found in ref. [7]\nand a summary of neutrino limits in ref. [8].\nIn this paper, we analyse the constraints set\non both TD and SHDM models by the data of\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory, normalizing the\nUHECR flux to the Auger spectrum [9] and using the derived photon limit [10] and neutrino\nflux limit [11].\n\nSuper-heavy dark matter scenarios\n(SHDM)\nMost SHDM models predict UHECR fluxes\ndominated by the contribution of the Milky\nWay halo, so that propagation effects on both\nthe spectrum and the composition are insignificant for the commonly used radio background\nmodels [14]. UHECRs should thus be observed\nas produced, with a relatively hard spectrum\nup to a fraction of the initial mass of the SHDM\nprogenitors and a dominant photon component\n(here we use the recent results of [15]). The latter prediction can be tested with Auger, thanks\nto the photon/hadron discrimination power of\nboth the surface detector and the fluorescence\n\ndetector [12, 10]. In Fig. 1a, we show a fit of\nthe highest energy part of UHECR spectrum\nby SHDM decay products, assumed to account\nfor the measured flux above 8 1019 eV. In addition to the primary photon flux, we show the\n\"apparent flux\" as would be reconstructed by\nthe Auger analysis procedure assuming proton\nprimaries, through which a photon of energy\nE\u03b3 would be typically misinterpreted as a proton of energy Ep = E\u03b3 /2. This \"apparent\"\nphoton component, added to the nucleon flux,\nmakes up the total inferred UHECR spectrum.\nTo explore the parameter space of SHDM models, we fit the last few bins of the spectrum\n(above 4 1019 eV, 8 1019 eV, or 1020 eV) using different values for the mass and normalization amplitude, according to the procedure\ndescribed in [16].\nIn Fig. 1b, we show the corresponding photon\nfraction for two extreme cases of SHDM scenarios, giving the largest (upper curve) or lowest\npossible photon fraction (three lower curves).\nThe latter are derived under the assumption\nthat SHDM particles provide the dominant\ncontribution to the UHECRs above the three\nindicated energies, respectively.

However, since TDs are expected to\nbe evenly distributed throughout the universe,\npropagation effects are important and photons\nare strongly suppressed by their interactions\nwith the extragalactic photon backgrounds.\nTheir energy loss length is much smaller than\nthat of protons up to above 1020 eV, so that the\npredicted photon-to-proton ratio at Earth remains limited (much lower than the ratio at the\nsource). In Fig. 2a, we show a fit of the highest energy part of the spectrum within a typical TD model, where the proton component\ndominates up to the highest detected energies.\nIn Fig. 2b, the expected range of photon-toproton ratios is shown for a variety of TD models (see, e.g., [1]), with different values of the\nmaximum energies at the source. As can be\nseen, the current experimental limits only constrain the most photon-rich cases, and a wide\n\nrange of models remain compatible with the\ndata. Note that the model predictions arevery\nsensitive to the actual spectrum they are trying to account for. In particular, the results\nare different if one fits the AGASA data or the\nHiRes data with SHDM and TD models [13].\nIn the case of the Pierre Auger Observatory\nit is more difficult to constrain contribution of\nthose models due to presence of the supression\nin the spectrum at highest energies [9].\nIn Fig. 3, we plot the overall proton, photon\nand neutrino spectra associated with the propagation of UHECRs from a typical TD model,\ndown to 100 MeV. This involves the secondary\nneutrinos produced by charged pion decay and\nthe gamma-rays from the electromagnetic cascade induced by the UHE photons in the extragalactic medium. Such TD models are not\nconstrained by the EGRET [17] limit on the\ndiffuse gamma-ray background. The neutrino\nupper limit set by Auger at high energy is also\nshown. Larger statistics expected in the future\nmay lead to the strongest constraints on these\nmodels from the Auger data, or possibly the\ndetection of their neutrino counterparts. Topdown photons should also be detected eventually in this case.\n\nDiscussion\nWe have analysed the implications to top-down\nUHECR source scenarios of three complemen-\n\n\fConstraints on top-down models\n10000\n\nEGRET\n1000\n\nj(E) E2 [eV cm-2 s-1 sr-1]\n\nAuger \u03bd\n100\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bd\n\n10\n\nAuger\np\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n1e+08\n\n1e+10\n\n1e+12\n\n1e+14\n\n1e+16\n\n1e+18\n\n1e+20\n\nE [eV]\n\nFigure 3: Photon (solid red line), neutrino\n(dashed-dotted green line), and proton (dashed\nblue line) fluxes from a TD model with cascade\nphotons down to GeV.

We found that superheavy dark matter models are strongly constrained by the absence of identified photon\ncandidates in the Auger data. In particular,\nthey cannot provide the dominant contribution\nto the overall UHECR flux at any energy below\n\u223c 1020 eV, which strongly restricts their motivation. On the other hand, models involving topological defects generally predict photon fractions after propagation that are compatible with the current data, while their neutrino counterpart may be more strongly constrained by future neutrino flux limits obtained\nwith the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
