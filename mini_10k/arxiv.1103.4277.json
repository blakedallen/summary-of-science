Low-mass dileptons are considered a powerful and unique probe to\ndiagnose the hot and dense strongly interacting quark gluon plasma formed in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. They are sensitive to chiral symmetry\nrestoration effects expected to take place in these collisions [2]. They can also\nbe used to detect the thermal radiation emitted by the plasma via virtual\nphotons providing a direct measurement of the plasma temperature, one of its\nmost basic properties [3].\nPHENIX is a large multipurpose experiment specially devoted to the measurement of rare probes, and electromagnetic probes in particular [4]. At\nmid-rapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.35) the detector has excellent electron identification\ncapabilities based on a RICH detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter. It\nalso has a mass resolution of about 1% at the \u03c6 mass, which allows precision\nspectroscopy measurements of the light vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6. The observation of spectral shape modifications of these mesons could provide direct\ninformation on the chiral symmetry restoration. However, the measurement of\nlow-mass electron pairs in the original PHENIX detector configuration suffers\nfrom a huge combinatorial background, with a signal to background ratio of\nS/B ' 1/200 in the invariant dielectron mass range of m = 0.3-0.5 GeV/c2\n[5]. The combinatorial background comes from the overwhelming yield of \u03c0 0\nDalitz decays and \u03b3 conversions and originates from the limited geometrical\nacceptance of the PHENIX detector (the central arm spectrometers consist of\ntwo arms each one covering the pseudo-rapidity interval |\u03b7| < 0.35 and 90o\nin azimuthal angle) and the very strong magnetic field starting at the vertex.\nConsequently, very often only one of the two tracks of an e+ e\u2212 pair is detected\nin the central arm detectors. The second track never reaches the detectors (because it falls out of the acceptance or is curled by the magnetic field) or is not\ndetected due to the inability to reconstruct low-momentum tracks with pT <\n200 MeV/c. These single tracks, when paired to other electron tracks in the\nsame event, give rise to the combinatorial background.\nThe HBD aims at considerably reducing the combinatorial background from\nthe two main background sources, \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays and \u03b3 conversions. The detector exploits the distinctive feature of the e+ e\u2212 pairs from these two sources,\nnamely their very small opening angle. The HBD is therefore located in a field\nfree region that preserves the original direction of the e+ e\u2212 pair. Electron\ntracks identified in the central arm detectors are rejected as likely partners of\na \u03c0 0 Dalitz decay or a \u03b3 conversion pair if the corresponding hit in the HBD\nhas a double amplitude or has a nearby hit within the typical opening angle\n2\n\n\fof these pairs.\nThe HBD consists of a Cherenkov radiator that is directly coupled to a triple\nGas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [6] detector with a CsI photocathode. Both\nthe radiator and the GEMs are operated with pure CF4 in a common gas\nvolume. The detector was constructed after extensive R&D to demonstrate\nthe concept validity (see [7,8] for the R&D results and [9,10] for other previous\nreports related to the HBD).\nThis paper gives a comprehensive report on the design, construction, operation\nand performance of the HBD. The detector was commissioned in 2007 and has\nbeen fully operational since the fall of 2008. It was used as an integral part of\nthe PHENIX detector in the RHIC runs of 2009 and 2010 which were devoted\nto the study of p+p collisions and Au+Au collisions, respectively. The paper\nis organized as follows: Section 2 presents the overall detector concept. The\nrealization of the detector, including design, construction and test, is described\nin detail in Section 3. The detector services, including the readout electronics,\nthe gas handling and monitoring system and the high voltage system are\ndescribed in Sections 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The operation and monitoring\nof the detector under running conditions are presented in Section 7. Section 8\ngives a comprehensive account of the detector performance. A short summary\nis provided in Section 9.\n\n2\n\nDetector concept\n\nThe main task of the HBD is to recognize and reject \u03b3 conversions and \u03c0 o\nDalitz decays. The strategy is to exploit the fact that the opening angle of\nelectron pairs from these sources is very small compared to the pairs from\nlight vector mesons. In a field-free region, this angle is preserved and by applying an opening angle cut one can reject more than 90% of the conversions\nand \u03c0 o Dalitz decays, while keeping most of the signal. The PHENIX central\narm magnetic field consists of an inner and outer coil that can be operated\nindependently. The field free region, necessary for the operation of the HBD,\nis generated by allowing the current in these two coils to flow in opposite directions. In this so-called \"+\u2212\" mode, the inner coil located at a radius of \u223c\n60 cm counteracts the action of the outer coil resulting in an almost field free\nregion extending out to \u223c 50-60 cm in the radial direction. The size of the\nHBD is constrained by the available space in the field free region, from the\nbeam pipe (at r \u223c 5 cm) up to the location of the inner coil. Fig. 1 shows the\nlayout of the inner part of the PHENIX detector together with the location\nof the coils and the HBD.\nThe system specifications of the HBD were defined by Monte Carlo simula3\n\n\fFig. 1. Top layout of the inner part of the PHENIX central arm detector showing\nthe location of the HBD and the inner and outer coils.\n\ntions performed at the ideal detector level aiming at reducing the combinatorial background originating from conversions and \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays by two\norders of magnitude. At this level of rejection, the quality of the low-mass\ne+ e\u2212 pair measurement is no longer limited by the background originating\nfrom these sources, but rather by the background originating from the semileptonic decay of charmed mesons. The simulations showed that the goal can\nbe achieved with a detector that provides electron identification with an efficiency of \u223c90%. This also implies a double electron hit recognition at a\ncomparable level. The separation between single and double electron hits is\none of the main performance parameters of this detector. On the other hand,\na moderate hadron rejection factor of \u2264 50 is sufficient. It is also important\nto have a larger acceptance in the HBD compared to the fiducial central arm\nacceptance to provide a veto area for the rejection of pairs where only one\npartner is inside the fiducial acceptance.\nThe requirements on electron identification limit the choice to a Cherenkovtype detector. In order to generate enough UV photons in a \u223c50 cm long\nradiator to ensure good distinction between single and double hits, we adopted\na windowless scheme without mirror and chose pure CF4 as radiator and\ndetector gas. The use of a UV transparent window between the radiator and\nthe detector element and of a mirror, as commonly done in RICH detectors,\nlimits the bandwidth to about 8-9 eV. The choice of CF4 both as the radiator\nand detector gas in a windowless geometry results in a very large bandwidth\n(from \u223c6 eV given by the threshold of CsI to \u223c11.1 eV given by the CF4\ncut-off) and consequently a very large figure of merit N0 . The N0 value is\nestimated to be close to 700 cm\u22121 under ideal conditions with no losses. The\nlarge value of N0 ensures a very high electron efficiency, and more importantly,\n4\n\n\fFig. 2. Triple GEM stack operated in the standard forward bias mode (left) and in\nthe hadron-blind reverse bias mode (right).\n\nis crucial for achieving good double-hit resolution.\nIn this windowless proximity focus configuration, the Cherenkov light from\nparticles passing through the radiator is directly collected on a photosensitive\ncathode plane, forming an almost circular blob image rather than a ring as in a\nconventional RICH detector. After consideration of relevant options, we chose\na triple GEM detector with a CsI photocathode evaporated on the top surface\nof the first GEM foil as the active detector element. The signal is collected by\na pad readout at the bottom of the GEM stack (see Fig. 2). In this reflective\nphotocathode scheme, the photoelectrons are pulled into the holes of the GEM\nby the strong electric field inside the holes and the photocathode is totally\nscreened from photons produced in the avalanche process.\nThe hadron blindness property of the HBD is achieved by operating the detector in the so-called reverse bias mode as opposed to the standard forward\nbias (FB) mode (see Fig. 2). In the reverse bias (RB) mode, the mesh is set at\na lower negative voltage with respect to the GEM and consequently the ionization electrons deposited by a charged particle in the drift region between\nthe entrance mesh and the top GEM are mostly repelled towards the mesh\n(see Fig. 2 right panel). Consequently, the signal produced by a charged particle results only from (i) the collection of ionization charge from only a thin\nlayer of \u223c 100 \u03bcm above the top GEM which is subject to the entire 3-stage\namplification, and (ii) the collection of ionization charge in the first transfer\ngap (between the top and the middle GEMs) which is subject to a 2-stage amplification only. The ionization electrons produced in the second transfer gap\nand in the induction gap generate a negligible signal since they experience one\nand zero stages of amplification, respectively. For a drift region and a transfer\ngap of 1.5 mm each and a total gas gain of 5000, the mean amplitude of a\nhadron signal drops to \u223c 10% of its value in the forward bias mode [8].\nThe readout pad plane consists of hexagonal pads with an area of 6.2 cm2\n(hexagon side length a = 1.55 cm) which is comparable to, but smaller than,\n5\n\n\fthe blob size which has a maximum area of 9.9 cm2 . Therefore, the probability\nof a single-pad hit by an electron entering the HBD is very small. On the\nother hand, a hadron traversing the HBD will produce a signal predominantly\nlocalized in a single pad. This provides an additional strong handle in the\nhadron rejection of the HBD.\nThe relatively large pad size also results in a low granularity thereby reducing\nthe cost of the detector. In addition, since the signal produced by a single\nelectron is distributed between 2-3 pads, one expects a primary charge of\nseveral photoelectrons per pad, allowing the operation of the detector at a\nrelatively moderate gain of a few times 103 . This is a crucial advantage for\nstable operation of a UV photon detector.\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\nHBD design, construction, and testing\n\nDesign overview\n\nThe detector design derives from the system specifications and the space constraints discussed in Section 2. In addition, special care was taken to minimize\n(i) the amount of material in order to reduce as much as possible the number\nof photon conversions in the central arm acceptance and (ii) the dead or inactive areas due to frames or spacing between adjacent detector modules in\norder to achieve the highest possible efficiency. Table 1 summarizes the most\nimportant design parameters.\nTable 1\nDesign parameters of the HBD.\nAcceptance\n\n|\u03b7| \u2264 0.45 \u2206\u03c6 =135o\n\nGEM size (\u03c6 \u00d7 z)\n\n23 \u00d7 27 cm2\n\nGEM supporting frame and cross (w x d)\n\nframe: 5\u00d71.5 mm2 , cross: 0.3\u00d71.5 mm2\n\nHexagonal pad side length\n\na = 15.5 mm\n\nNumber of pads per arm\n\n1152\n\nDead area within central arm acceptance\n\n7%\n\nTotal Radiation length within central arm acceptance\n\n2.40%\n\nWeight per arm (including HV and gas connectors)\n\n<10 kg\n\nThe HBD is made of two identical arms, located close to the interaction vertex.\nThe entrance window is located just after the beam pipe at r\u223c5 cm. The\ndetector extends to r\u223c60 cm in the radial direction and 65.5 cm along the\nbeam axis (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 left panel). Each arm covers 135o in azimuthal\n6\n\n\fFig. 3.

This extended acceptance with\nrespect to the central arms (which cover 90o in \u03c6 and \u00b10.35 units in \u03b7) provides\na very generous veto area for efficient rejection of close pairs where only one\ntrack falls inside the fiducial acceptance.\nThe right panel of Fig. 3 shows an exploded view of one HBD arm, displaying the various elements of the detector. Each arm consists of a \u223c50 cm long\nradiator directly coupled to a triple GEM photon detector. The latter is subdivided in 12 detector modules, 6 along the \u03c6 axis \u00d7 2 along the z axis. With\nthis segmentation, each detector module is \u223c23 \u00d7 27 cm2 in size. In the 2009\nand 2010 RHIC runs, 10 modules were instrumented in each arm covering\nan azimuthal range of 112.5o which is considerably larger than the azimuthal\nrange of 90o covered by the central arm detectors.\n\n3.2\n\nDetector vessel\n\nThe detector vessel has a polygonal shape formed by panels glued together as\nshown in Fig. 3. Eight panels of 63.0 \u00d7 23.7 cm2 and two vertical panels of\n63.0 \u00d7 54.8 cm2 define the polygonal shape. The panels consist of a 19 mm\nthick honeycomb core sandwiched between two 0.25 mm thick FR4 sheets.\nSix of the eight panels define the HBD active area. The other two panels,\noutside the active area, are service panels. Gas-in and gas-out connections,\nHV connectors serving the GEMs, and a small UV-transparent window are\nlocated on these two panels.\nTwo supporting frames made of FR4, 19 mm thick (dictated by the thickness of\nthe honeycomb core of the panels) and 7 mm wide, connect all panels together\non each side providing mechanical stability and rigidity to the entire box. A\nthin window around the beam pipe is used to further reduce the radiation\nlength in the HBD fiducial acceptance. The window is made of a 50 \u03bcm thick\n7\n\n\fFig. 4. Exploded view of one panel of the HBD vessel and readout board.\n\nlayer of aclar and a 25 \u03bcm thick layer of black kapton on the inside to minimize\nreflections. It is glued on a semi-cylindrical FR4 frame bolted to the supporting\nframe along the beam axis and is therefore easily removable. The two sides\nof the box are closed with covers made of 12.5 mm thick honeycomb core\nsandwiched between two 0.25 mm thick FR4 facesheets that are bolted on\nthe supporting frame with an o-ring seal. Each side panel also has a 12.5 mm\nthick (dictated by the thickness of the honeycomb core of the side covers) and\n15 mm wide frame around its perimeter to provide rigidity in the bolting area.\nFig. 4 presents an exploded view of a single back-side panel, showing the\nvarious components of one HBD panel (two detector modules) and the readout\nboard attached to it. The mesh and the three GEM foils are mounted on\nFR4 fiberglass frames. The frames have a width of 5 mm and a thickness of\n1.5 mm that defines the intergap distance. To prevent sagitta of the foils in\nthe electrostatic fields, the frames have a supporting cross (0.3 mm thick)\nin the middle. The three GEM foils and the mesh are stacked together and\nattached to the detector vessel by 8 pins. These pins, located at the corners\nand the middle of the frame, keep the tension on the GEM foils and the mesh\nwhile maintaining a minimum deformation of the 5 mm wide frames. Special\ntooling was developed to stretch the foils and the mesh and to glue them onto\nthe narrow frames. The design allows for only 1 mm clearance between two\nadjacent detectors. With this design, the resulting total dead area within the\ncentral arm acceptance is calculated to be 7%.\nThe detector anode is a double-sided printed circuit board (PCB) with a\nhexagonal pad pattern on the inner side and short signal traces (seen at the\nbottom of Fig. 5) on the other side. The side length of the hexagonal pads is\na = 15.5 mm resulting in 96 pads in each detector module and a total of 1152\npads in each arm. Plated-through holes in the PCB connect the pads to the\nsignal traces. Short wires are soldered at the edges of these traces (\u223c1.5 cm\nfrom the plated-through holes), passed through small holes in the panels and\n8\n\n\fsoldered to traces on the readout board located outside the detector that carry\nthe signals to the preamplifiers (see Fig. 5). The PCB is made of 50 \u03bcm thick\nkapton foil with 5 \u03bcm copper cladding, in one single piece (\u223c140 \u00d7 63 cm2 ).\nThe PCB is glued onto the eight panels which define the outside polygonal\nshape of the detector vessel (see Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 5. Backplane of detector panel consisting of hexagonal pad plane connected by\nwires to the readout board containing the preamplifiers.\n\nSpecial attention was taken in the design to ensure gas tightness of the detector\nvessel. The plated-through holes are effectively sealed by the panels that are\nglued on the back side of the PCB. Making the PCB in one piece and gluing\nit to the panels behind prevents any potential leaks at the junctions between\nadjacent panels. The junctions between adjacent panels of the vessel are easily\nsealed by gluing a 50 \u03bcm thick kapton strip along the inner side of the junction.\nThe leak rate in each vessel, which has a total volume of 313 l, was measured\nto be \u223c0.12 cc/min.\nEach detector vessel alone weighs \u223c5 kg and adding all other components\n(HV connectors, gas in/out, GEM foils, preamplifier cards...) results in a total\nweight of less than 10 kg per arm. The total radiation length of the detector\nvessel within the central arm acceptance is calculated to be 0.82%. To this,\none must add the contribution of the readout board and pre-amps that is\nattached to the vessel (estimated to be 1.03%) and the 50 cm CF4 radiator\ngas (estimated to be 0.56%) to give a total of 2.4 % of a radiation length for\nthe entire detector. The material budget is itemized in Table 2.\n9\n\n\fTable 2\nMaterial budget of the HBD within the PHENIX central arm acceptance. The\nlayout of the readout boards, pre-amps and sockets is rather complex, and for these\ncomponents the thickness values quoted represent an average over the detector area.\n\nComponent\n\nMaterial\n\nX0 (cm)\n\nThickness (cm)\n\nArea (%)\n\nRad.

Each GEM is made of a 50 \u03bcm thick, metal-clad (5 \u03bcm thick\ncopper on each side) polymer foil commonly known as kapton. It is chemically etched to produce a highly dense pattern of 60-80 \u03bcm diameter holes\nwith 140 \u03bcm pitch. The copper coated area of the foils is 268.4 \u00d7 221 mm2 ,\nwhereas the operational area i.e. the area with holes is 261.4 \u00d7 214 mm2 .\nThe top face of each GEM foil is divided into 28 high voltage segments: 26\ncentral segments of 8 mm each and a first and last segment of 6.5 mm. The\ngap without copper between the segments is 200 \u03bcm. Fig. 6 gives the detailed\ngeometry of the GEM foils, showing the various dimensions.\n10\n\n\fFig. 6. GEM foils used in the HBD showing global dimensions and details of HV\nstrips and copper recesses at the location of the pins.\n\nAll GEM foils were electrically tested at CERN prior to shipping to the Weizmann Institute. The tests were done in a clean room in dry air (<30% humidity). The foils were accepted if the leakage current was below 5 nA at\n600 V.\nUpon arrival at the Weizmann Institute the foils were again electrically tested\nbefore framing. The test was done in air, either in a clean room or on a\nlaminar flow table. HV was applied on the top surface of the GEM foil to\neach of the 28 strips with the bottom surface grounded. Since the humidity\nin the test area was not as low at it was during the initial test at CERN the\nvoltage was raised up to only 550 V. However, the criteria for accepting a\ngood foil was the same as it was at CERN, namely less than \u223c5 nA of leakage\ncurrent. A few foils exhibited a high current or even a short during testing.\nThe foils which showed high leakage current were gently blown with clean and\ndry compressed nitrogen in order to remove any residual dust that could cause\nthe high leakage current. If after this cleaning procedure the foil still showed\nhigh leakage current it was rejected. However, this happened very rarely.\nAfter passing the HV test the foils are ready to be glued on FR4 frames. The\nframes are 5 mm wide and with inner dimensions of 263.4 \u00d7 216.0 mm2 so that\nthe \"dead\" area of the foil, i.e. the area without holes, is 1 mm wide along the\ninner sides of the frame. This 1 mm spacing prevents glue from filling the holes\nduring framing. First the foils are stretched using a custom designed stretching\nfixture (see Fig. 7). The 400 \u00d7 400 mm2 foil is placed inside L-shaped frames\nalong each of the four sides, covered with aluminum bars and tightened down\nwith a set of screws. The foil is then stretched using two bolts on each of the\nfour sides of the frame to equally distribute the tension across the foil.\n11\n\n\fFig. 7. The stretching device used to stretch the GEM foils. See the text for details.\n\nAfter stretching, the foil is carefully aligned with respect to the FR4 frame\nin order to match the eight mounting holes in the foil to those in the frame,\nusing a positioning device which also serves as glue dispenser (see Fig. 8). The\nlatter consists of a rigid base on which a small lifting table is mounted that\ncontains a large plate the size of the foil. The FR4 frame is mounted on top\nof this plate together with a Teflon frame and eight Teflon pins that protrude\nseveral mm. The stretching device together with the stretched foil is then\nmounted a few millimeters above the positioning device for the hole alignment.\nThe positioning device allows for a fine adjustment of the position of the\nlarge plate. Once the holes are aligned, the stretching device is momentarily\nremoved to apply glue to the FR4 frame. A custom designed glue dispenser\nmoves along a grove on the plate and deposits a uniform layer of glue of\n\u223c100 \u03bcm thickness onto the FR4 frame. The glue used is Araldite AY103\nepoxy with HY991 hardener mixed in a proportion of 100:40 by weight. The\nglue is pumped prior to use in a desiccator in order to remove residual air\nbubbles and had to be applied within about one hour after mixing with full\npolymerization taking approximately 16 hours at 30-35o C. After applying the\nglue, the stretching device together with the stretched foil is brought back to\nthe positioning device. After verifying the alignment, the lifting table is raised\nin order to bring the FR4 frame in contact with the foil. The assembly is then\nfixed and allowed to cure for typically \u223c24 hours.\nThe foils are then cut and removed from the stretching frame. First, a rough\ncut is made around the FR4 frame using a scalpel (Fig. 7 shows the remaining\npart of the foil after this cut). Then a precise cut, very close to the frame, is\nmade in order to remove the remaining Kapton. The foil is then cleaned by\ngently blowing it with clean dry nitrogen. Another electrical test is performed\n12\n\n\fFig. 8. The GEM positioning and glue dispenser device. The GEM is glued on the\nFR4 frame secured with pins on the teflon frame. The glue dispenser, seeing on the\nlower left corner, applies a uniform glue layer of \u223c100 \u03bcm thickness when moving\nalong the grove on the plate.\n\nby raising each high voltage strip to 550 V in air as had previously been done.\nIn some rare cases, some foils do not pass the acceptance criteria of less than\n\u223c5 nA of leakage current. These foils are then washed with deionized water,\nrinsed with alcohol, blown dry and tested again. This process is sometimes\nrepeated two times. If the leakage current still exceeds our limit after the\nsecond trial, the foil is rejected.\nGEMs that pass the high voltage tests then have 20 M\u03a9 surface mounted resistors installed on each high voltage segment. When soldering these resistors,\nthe GEM is placed inside a Plexiglas box such that only the soldering pads\nfor the resistors protrude out for soldering in order to protect the active area\nof the GEM foil. After soldering the resistors, the foils are again tested up to\n550 V as a final high voltage test before shipping them off to Stony Brook\nUniversity for assembly into the HBD vessel.\n\n3.4\n\n3.4.1\n\nAssembly and testing\n\nGEM storage prior to assembly\n\nTo ensure a dust and water-free environment, GEMs that arrive at Stony\nBrook are stored under high vacuum. A turbo-molecular pump is used to\ngenerate vacuum in the low 10\u22126 Torr range. Prior to insertion in vacuum,\neach GEM is further washed and tested.\nGEMs are gently sprayed with deionized water for \u223c30 seconds, followed by\n13\n\n\fa rinse with clean isopropyl alcohol. The GEMs are then blown dry with\ncompressed gas that was passed through a gas ionizer to facilitate removal of\nany dust particles. The GEMs are then placed in high vacuum for 24 hours to\nensure removal of all moisture from the kapton and FR4 frames. GEMs that\ncontain moisture are found to have large leakage currents (on the order of a\nfew \u03bcA at dV = 100 V). This washing process is repeated on any GEMs which\ndevelop anomalously high leakage current and successfully recovers \u223c30% of\nthese GEMs.\nAfter drying in vacuum, each GEM is moved to a high voltage test station on\na laminar flow table with an ISO Class 1 atmosphere. Three electrical tests\nare then performed in air:\n(1) The leads of each GEM are checked to have continuity to the top or bottom of the GEM. This is most easily tested by confirming the capacitance\nof the GEM through the leads with a hand-held multimeter.\n(2) Each individual strip on the top side of the GEM is tested for continuity\nthrough the resistors to the HV input trace. With the bottom of the\nGEM grounded, the top side of the GEM is raised to -100 V. A voltage\nprobe is used to determine that the proper voltage is present on each\nof the 28 strips on the top side of the GEM. During this process, the\nleakage current is carefully monitored. GEMs drawing less than 5 nA are\naccepted.\n(3) High voltage is finally applied to the GEM to monitor stability and leakage current. A current limit of 1 \u03bcA is set on the power supply to limit\ndamage to the GEM in the event of a discharge. With the bottom side of\nthe GEM grounded, the top side is slowly brought to 550 V. GEMs that\nare stable and have leakage currents less than 5 nA are accepted. GEMs\nwhich initially display moderately high leakage currents (\u223c10-500 nA),\nbut no discharges, are left at voltage for up to an hour. Often the current\nfalls back into the acceptable range.\nGEMs that pass these tests are returned to high vacuum for storage, while\nthose that fail are rewashed and tested again. GEMs which continue to fail\nafter two cycles of washing are not used in the HBD.\n\n3.4.2\n\nCopper GEM assembly\n\nAll GEMs are dust sensitive and must be handled in a clean room or (preferably) upon a laminar flow table. Once coated with CsI, the devices are also\nwater sensitive and will lose their quantum efficiency if exposed to an atmosphere with high water concentration for an extended period of time. For this\nreason, CsI-coated photosensitive GEMs are handled in the inert atmosphere\nof a glovebox. Unfortunately, since a glovebox is a closed-loop system it cannot\n14\n\n\fmaintain the level of cleanliness found on the laminar table. Because of this,\nstrategies that minimize handling of the HBD (and GEMs) in the glovebox\nwere found to produce the best results. The most successful procedure for HBD\nassembly involved assembling the bottom two layers of all GEM stacks in the\ncleanest available environment (the laminar flow table), and then adding the\nCsI-coated GEMs in the dry glovebox environment. This procedure limited\nexposure to the glovebox environment to 2-3 weeks.\nFor installation of the Cu GEMs, the HBD vessel is mounted on a rotating\nfixture and placed in front of the laminar flow table. With clean air blowing\nthrough the interior of the vessel, the standard copper GEMs (two per module)\nare mounted in place over the readout pads as shown in Fig. 9. After mounting,\neach GEM is re-tested in situ for continuity and stability (tests no. 1 and 3\nabove) to ensure no damage was caused during installation.\n\nFig. 9. Installation of standard copper GEMs into the HBD vessel prior to placing\nthe vessel in the glovebox.\n\nOnce all standard GEMs are installed and re-tested, the vessel is moved into\na sealed glovebox to accept the CsI-coated gold GEMs at the top of the tripleGEM stack. Once sealed, the glovebox recirculates nitrogen through a purifier\nand achieves H2 O concentrations of < 10 ppm. Regular sweeps of the interior\nof the glovebox with an ULPA vacuum cleaner mounted inside the glovebox\natmosphere ensure that particulate contamination is at an acceptable level.\nOne critical choice for the glovebox was the selection of the material of the\ngloves themselves. While Butyl gloves provide the best water barrier, they\nare not highly rated with regard to generation of particulate matter. Hypalon\ngloves were selected as having the best rating for particulate matter, and were\nfound to elevate the baseline water concentration of an empty glovebox from\n2-3 ppm to 7-8 ppm, which was still quite acceptable.\n15\n\n\f3.4.3\n\nEvaporation of CsI onto Au plated GEMs\n\nGEMs are made photosensitive by the evaporation of a thin layer of CsI on\nthe GEM electrode surface. This layer is not chemically stable on a copper\nsubstrate since CuI is more tightly bound than CsI. For this reason, a special\nsubset of the GEM production included GEMs whose metallic surface was\noverlayed with Ni (diffusion barrier) and then Au (chemically inert layer) [11].\nNot surprisingly, these GEMs were seen to have identical gain and voltage\nstability characteristics as the standard copper GEMs and were handled in\nan identical manner during the testing and framing stages performed at the\nWeizmann Institute of Science.\nReflective photocathodes exhibit a quantum efficiency that saturates as a\nfunction of the cathode thickness. For CsI, this saturation point is found at\n\u223c200 nm thickness. HBD photocathodes were made to have 300 nm thickness\nto ensure full sensitivity in spite of possible non-uniformities of the coating.\nGEM photocathodes are manufactured at Stony Brook by evaporating a \u223c300 nmthick layer of CsI to their top surface using an evaporator that was on loan\nfrom INFN [12]. The evaporator was used many times in the past to evaporate\nphotocathodes for RICH detectors used in CEBAF Hall A kaon experiments\n[13] and is of sufficient size to evaporate 4 HBD photocathodes simultaneously.\nGold GEMs are mounted four at a time into a sealed transfer box and placed\ninto the evaporator for CsI photocathode deposition. Additionally, several\nsmall (2 cm \u00d7 2 cm) Cu-Ni-Au circuit cards (called chicklets) are also mounted\ninto the box to be used as a monitor of the quantum efficiency (QE). A set\nof four GEMs and five chicklets ready for evaporation is shown in Fig. 10.\nOnce in the evaporator, the lid of the transfer box is removed to expose the\nGEMs. The evaporator is pumped down to a vacuum of \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Torr with\na combination of a turbopump and a cryopump. While pumping, the transfer\nbox containing the GEMs is heated to 40 \u25e6 C to drive off water and other\ncontaminants.\nFacing each GEM is a molybdenum crucible with a single piece of CsI weighing\n0.8 g. Once ultra high vacuum is achieved, the crucible is resistively heated\nto vaporize the CsI. A quartz thickness monitor positioned near the GEM\nsurfaces is used to determine the deposition rate of the CsI. By varying the\ncurrent through the crucibles, the rate is kept near 1 nm/s. The final thickness\nof the CsI layer is typically \u223c300 nm.\nAfter CsI deposition, the transfer box is moved to the QE measurement section of the evaporator. It was observed that the QE of newly deposited photocathodes can change (typically improve) by a factor of \u223c2 over a period of\n\u223c8 hours, so the measurement is not performed until this time has passed.\nA deuterium lamp shines through a 160 nm filter, enters the vacuum via a\n16\n\n\fFig. 10. The evaporation cart holds four Au-plated GEMs and five small circuit\ncards used to monitor the quality of each evaporation. Wheels on the cart allow\nto be moved in vacuum to map the quantum efficiency across the surface of each\nGEM.\n\nMgF2 window, and shines onto a movable mirror. This mirror can be rotated\nto allow the light to be directed either onto the GEM surface or onto a reference phototube of known QE. Once the light source has been calibrated\nusing this phototube, the QE of the new CsI photocathode can be determined\nrelative to the tube. A mesh with 300 V is used to draw photoelectrons from\nthe CsI surface, which is measured as current by a picoammeter. The transfer\nbox and phototube can both be translated inside the evaporator, allowing a\nscan of the entire surface of each photocathode. This measurement ensures\nthe photo-sensitivity of each cathode across its entire surface, but only at\na single wavelength. The small chicklets are later transferred to Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory, where a scan across the wavelength range 120 nm to\n200 nm is performed using a vacuum photospectrometer. It was found that\nevery evaporation during the entire history of the project produced identical\nphoto-sensitivity and uniformity.\n\n3.4.4\n\nInstallation of GEM photocathodes\n\nAfter the QE scan, the evaporator is backfilled with ultra high purity argon up\nto atmospheric pressure. The transfer box containing the gold GEMs with CsI\nphotocathodes is then sealed in the argon atmosphere before the evaporator\nchamber is opened to air. The sealed transfer box is put into the glovebox\nthrough a load-lock system, which prevents any room air from entering the\nglovebox. The transfer box is not opened until it is inside the dry nitrogen\natmosphere of the glovebox, ensuring that no humidity affects the photocathodes.\nThe glove box is set up in three modules, each with a distinct purpose. The first\nmodule has the rail system that accepts the transfer box from the evaporator,\nwith a winch mounted on the ceiling to lift the transfer box lid.\n17\n\n\fThe second module serves as the high voltage testing station for the gold GEMs\nafter CsI deposition. Here the gold GEMs undergo all the above mentioned\nelectrical tests, with the exception that the voltage in step 3 is decreased from\n550 V to 500 V in the nitrogen atmosphere of the glove box. It is common for\na gold GEM to exhibit several discharges upon the first application of high\nvoltage after CsI deposition, but stabilize afterwards. Rarely a gold GEM\nexhibits a short or anomalous leakage current after deposition. If so, it is\nwashed and the testing/deposition process is repeated.\nThe third station houses the HBD vessel. The vessel is mounted in a rotating\nfixture that can be turned to allow access to the edge modules (normally out\nof reach of the gloves). After the gold GEMs are mounted, all three GEMs in\na stack are tested in situ under high voltage. The mesh is then installed over\nthe stack, and 500 V is applied across the drift gap to ensure that there is no\nelectrical continuity between the GEM and mesh. A completed HBD vessel is\nshown in Fig. 11. The irredescent color of the GEM surfaces is created by the\nCsI coating.\n\nFig. 11. A complete HBD in the glovebox following installation of all photocathodes\nand meshes. The lucite device in the upper left is the scintillation cube, placed\noutside the acceptance of PHENIX and used to monitor quantum efficiency in situ\nand over time (see Section 3.6).\n\nOnce all the interior components of the HBD are assembled, final tests are done\nto ensure that the device is fully functional. Each GEM is tested by measuring\nthe capacitance across its HV input leads, and finally for high voltage stability.\nFollowing these tests, the sides of the vessel are installed while the vessel is\nstill inside the glovebox, sealing the dry nitrogen atmosphere inside. The vessel\nis then brought out of the glovebox and onto a test bench, and purged with\nCF4 .\n18\n\n\f3.5\n\nCosmic ray tests\n\nBecause many materials of the HBD (FR4, kapton) outgas water, it is necessary to store the HBD during testing with a high flow rate recirculating gas\nsystem. This system recycles CF4 gas at a rate of 2.2 slpm, and maintains\nwater levels below 20 ppm, and oxygen below 2 ppm. Measurements of higher\nwater contamination than oxygen are indicative of a system that is well sealed\nagainst leaks, but outgasses water from its interior surfaces.\nWhile under flow of CF4 , the HBD modules are turned on one-by-one with the\nmesh high voltage set in the forward bias mode. This polarity of mesh voltage\nmakes the HBD sensitive to ionizing particles and thereby cosmic ray muons.\nA small scintillator is placed above the sector under test and used as a trigger\nfor pulse-height spectra taken by a CAMAC-based DAQ system. Eight hours\nof tests not only provide an excellent stability measurement, but also sufficient\nstatistics from 14 pads (those shadowed by the trigger scintillator) to measure\nthe gain of each module. A typical measurement from the cosmic ray data\nis shown in Fig. 12. The spectrum contains three components: (i) Pedestal\n(fit with a Gaussian function), (ii) Single photoelectrons from scintillation\n(Exponential), and (iii) Ionization from ionizing tracks (Landau). Of these\nthree components, the response to the single photoelectrons from scintillation\nproved to be the most stable in establishing each module's gain. These data\nwere later used to set the operating voltage for each module.\n\nCounts\n\n105\n\n104\n\n103\n\n102\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n1000\nADC Channel\n\nFig. 12. A typical spectrum from the HBD being tested with a cosmic ray trigger.\nIn addition to the response to cosmics and pedestal, an exponential distribution\ndue to single photo-electrons from scintillation is seen and used for absolute gain\ndetermination.\n\n19\n\n\f3.6\n\nScintillaton Cubes\n\nThe photocathodes which were produced during the evaporation, installation\nand assembly were required to perform at maximum efficiency for the duration of the entire experiment, which spanned a period of almost two years.\nAs described in Section 5, the HBD gas system was designed to maintain the\ndetector gas at extremely low levels of water and oxygen, and performed extensive monitoring of these levels throughout the run. However, in order to\nbe sure that the photocathodes did not deteriorate over time, an independent\nmeans of monitoring their quantum efficiency was developed.\n\nFig. 13. Schematic representation of the scintillation cube inside the HBD detector.\nAlpha particles from the 241 Am source produce scintillation light which is focused\nonto the photocathode in one area of the detector. An 55 Fe source measures the gas\ngain in the same region, allowing a determination of the photoelectron yield from\nthe photocathode.\n\nThe method utilizes the scintillation light produced in CF4 to illuminate a\nsmall region of the photocathode which could be used to determine the photoelectron yield. It is then assumed that the rest of the photocathode is the\nsame, since all photocathodes are inside the same gas volume for each half\nof the detector. Fig. 13 shows a schematic representation of this device. It\nconsists of a lucite cube, which we refer to as a \"scintillation cube\", in which\na small (1 \u03bcCi) 241 Am source is mounted. Approximately 1 cm away, a silicon\nsurface barrier detector (SBD) is mounted to detect alpha particles which pass\nthrough the gas. The alpha particles deposit \u223c 4 MeV in the gas, and still\nhave enough residual energy to trigger the SBD, which is used to externally\ntrigger on the source. The scintillation light produced in the gas is focused\nonto the photocathode illuminating essentially one pad and producing \u223c 4-5\n20\n\n\fphotoelectrons. An 55 Fe source is also mounted in the cube which produces\n5.9 keV X-rays that convert in the gas and allow a determination of the gas\ngain in the same region of the detector. Using the gas gain and the peak\nof the photoelectron distribution, the photoelectron yield can be determined.\nWhile this does not give us a measure of the absolute quantum efficiency, it\ncan be used to monitor any changes in the quantum efficiency over time. Measurements of the photoelectron yield were performed several times throughout\nthe experiment, and, as discussed in Section 7.5, no change in the quantum\nefficiency was observed.\n\n4\n\nReadout electronics\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the readout pads are connected by wires passing through\nthe honeycomb back panels to individual hybrid preamplifiers located on readout boards mounted on the back of the detector. These wires were kept very\nshort (\u223c2 cm) in order to minimize pickup and noise. The preamps plug into\nsockets on the readout boards, which also contain power and ground planes\nthat form part of the overall ground plane of the detector. The entire detector\nis shielded by virtue of the ground planes on the readout boards and by copper\ncladding on all of the other FR4 structural panels. This essentially forms a\ncomplete Faraday shield for the detector, which is very important and effective\nin minimizing the noise on the front end readout electronics.\n\n4.1\n\nHybrid preamps\n\nThe charge signal from each readout pad of the GEMs is amplified by a custom\ndesigned hybrid preamplifier (IO1195-1) developed by the Instrumentation\nDivision at BNL. A simplified schematic circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 14.\nA detailed schematic can be obtained from BNL's Instrumentation Division\n[14]. It uses an FET input (2SK2314) that is capable of accepting bipolar\nsignals, but is used with only negative inputs with the HBD. The gain was set\nto give an output of \u00b1 100 mV for an input signal of 16 fC (100,000 e), which\ncorresponds to an average primary charge of 20 photoelectrons at a gas gain of\n5*103 . It has a peaking time of 70 ns and a decay time of 1 \u03bcs. When connected\nto the GEM pad, the noise was measured to be \u223c 1000 e, which is equivalent\nto 0.2 photoelectrons (p.e.) at a gain of 5 * 103 . The input to the preamp\nincorporates an additional FET that is used for discharge protection, which\nadds slightly to the noise, but helps to protect against damage from sparks.\nIt should be noted that throughout the entire operation of the detector, not\na single preamp was ever damaged due to sparking.\n21\n\n\f5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nD\n\nD\n\nVcc\n1pF\nTest Pulse\n200\n2.4K\n2SK2314\n\nC\n\nInput\n\nVb\n\n10M\n\nGain\n\nDifferential Driver\n50\n\nG=4\n\nC\n\nG=2\n50\n\nInput Protection\n\nVb\n1pF\n\nMMBT4416\n\n750\n\n374\n\nB\n\nB\n\nVee\n\nFig. 14.

The cable used to connect the preamp to the shaper (Meritec Hard\nMetric 700319-01) is 10 m long and consists of 2 isolated 26 gauge parallel\nwires per channel with an overall shield and has an impedance of 100 \u03a9. The\npreamp operates with \u00b15 V and draws 165 mW per channel. The preamps\nwere designed with a small overall profile (19 mm \u00d7 15 mm) in order to\nminimize their mass (see Table 2).\n\nA\n\nTitle\n\nIO1195-1\n\nSize\nA\n\nDate:\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nDocument Number\nIO1195-1.DSN\n\nMonday, January 31, 2011\n\nSheet\n\n2\n\nThe preamp also includes a 1 pF capacitor that allows injecting a known\namount of charge into the input stage. A test pulse of known amplitude is\ngenerated externally and brought in on the readout boards where it is distributed in groups of 8-12 channels to the individual preamps. The test pulse\nprovides a convenient way to test and calibrate all the preamps on the detector\nand to monitor the electronic gain of the system.\n\n4.2\n\nFront End Module\n\nThe overall layout for the HBD FEM is shown in Fig. 15, and further details are\ngiven in [15]. The FEM receives the preamp signals using a differential receiver,\nwhich provides some additional shaping, and then digitizes them using a 65\nMHz 8 channel 12 bit flash ADC (Texas Instrument ADS5272). Each FEM\ncontains six 8 channel ADCs for a total of 48 channels per module. The gain\nof the shaper was set such that a preamp input charge of 16 fC (105 electrons)\nproduces a signal of 160 ADC channels (0.1 fC/ch). The preamp signal was\nset in the range of \u00b1 1.5 V around the ADC common mode voltage, which\neffectively uses only half of the full dynamic range of the ADC. The ADC\nclock is derived from the 9.6 MHz RHIC clock at six times its frequency, i.e.\n22\n\nRev\nA\n\n1\n\nof\n1\n\n1\n\n\f12X ADC clock\n\nReference clock\n\nPreamp\nInputs\n\n6 X beam Clock\nclock\nFanout\n\nFrame marker\n\nDifferential\nreceiver\n\nSerialized ADC DATA\n\nADC\n\n2x beam clock\n6x beam clock\nBeam phase,\ninit, L1\n\nFPGA\nDe-serializer\n\nSerial\ncommand\n\nL1\nDelay\nBuffer\n\n5 L1\nAccepted\nEvent\nbuffer\n\nToken\nPassing\nData\n\nToken\nPassing\nDataway\n\n48 channel\nADC board\n\nFrame marker\n\nADC\n\nSerialized ADC DATA\n\nReference clock\n\nDifferential\nreceiver\n\nDe-serializer\n\ncommand/\noffline data read\n\nBused command\nSerial data\n\n12X ADC clock\n\nFig. 15.

The output of the ADC is serialized\nat 12 times the ADC clock and sent along with additional reference signals to\nan ALTERA Straitx III 60 FPGA where the data is de-serialized. The FPGA\nhas 8 independent serializer/de-serializer blocks which are used for the eight\nchannels of each ADC. It also provides a de-serialized function that outputs\n6 bit wide data at 120 MHz, which are then regrouped into 12 bit wide ADC\ndata within the FPGA. The PHENIX DAQ requires event buffering for up to 5\nevents and 40 beam crossings for its Level 1 trigger, which is also accomplished\nwithin the FPGA. The FPGA could also provide a Level 1 trigger output\nfor the PHENIX DAQ, but this feature was never implemented during data\ntaking.\n\nFig. 16. HBD FEM system and interface to the PHENIX Data Acquisition System.\n\nThe FEM system and its interface with the overall PHENIX DAQ are shown\nin Fig. 16 and are further described in [15]. The FEMs are hosted in a set of 6U\n23\n\n\fVME crates located in a single rack close to the detector. A custom dataway\nis used as a bus for serial data transmission between adjacent modules, and a\nClock Master Module is used to interface with the PHENIX Granule Timing\nModule that provides synchronization with the PHENIX timing and control\nsystem, and also provides a separate interface for slow downloads. The Level 0\n(L0) and Level 1 (L1) timing signals and serial data are generated within the\nClock Master Module and sent to the FEMs. Upon receiving an L1 trigger,\n12 samples of data per ADC channel are sent by optical fiber at six times the\nbeam crossing frequency to a set of Data Collection Modules located in the\nPHENIX Control Room with an average transfer time of \u223c 40 \u03bcs.\n\n5\n\nGas system and monitoring\n\nMaintaining high gas purity is a critical factor for the overall performance\nand operation of the HBD. In particular, impurities such as water and oxygen\nadversely affect the performance in several ways. Both water and oxygen have\nstrong absorption peaks for Cherenkov light in the spectral range of sensitivity\nof the CsI photocathodes, and even small levels of either of these contaminants\ncan produce a significant loss of photoelectrons. This is illustrated in Fig. 17,\nwhich shows the photon interaction cross sections for water and oxygen in the\n\nFig. 17. Photon absorption cross sections for water and oxygen over the wavelength\nrange of sensitivity of CsI to Cherenkov light. Solid curves are measurements made\non a spectrometer at BNL. Other water and oxygen measurements are from [16,17].\nThe Cherenkov yield times quantum efficiency is shown by the dashed curve and\ngiven in relative units on the right ordinate.\n\nwavelength range of interest. Fig. 18 shows how this translates into a loss in the\nnumber of photoelectrons in a 50 cm long radiator. The main source of oxygen\ncontamination is from leaks in the detector vessel. While these leaks are very\n24\n\n\fsmall (< 0.12 cc/min), they nevertheless allow some diffusion of oxygen into\nthe detector. The main source of water is from outgassing within the detector\nitself, particularly from the GEM foils and pad readout plane, which are made\nof kapton, and from the walls of the vessel, which are made of FR4. These\ncomponents produce a constant source of water inside the detector which could\nonly effectively be reduced by maintaining a high gas flow rate.\n\nFig. 18. Relative number of photoelectrons, Npe, produced in 50 cm CF4 as a\nfunction of the number of ppms of water and oxygen contamination in the gas.\n\nIn addition, prolonged exposure to water can cause a deterioration in the CsI\nquantum efficiency [18], and can also affect the gain stability of the GEMs\n[19], although these effects were not problems at the levels at which the HBD\nwas operated in PHENIX. Finally, CF4 is an aggressive gas requiring that all\ngas system components be resistant to chemical corrosion, and, in addition,\nCF4 is also very expensive.\nThese stringent demands require a sophisticated gas system that not only\ndelivers high quality gas to the detector, but also monitors the levels of the\ncritical contaminants to high precision. A recirculating gas system, shown in\nFig. 19, is implemented in order to limit gas consumption and reduce operating costs [20]. The system delivers clean gas (\u2264 1 ppm of H2 O and O2 ) to\nthe detector. The output gas is repurified by a set of filters and scrubbers\nbefore being reused. In addition, a percentage of fresh gas (typically \u223c 10%)\nis introduced during recirculation in order to help maintain the required level\nof purity. The main components of the system are housed in the PHENIX\nGas Mixing House, which is located approximately 100 meters from the detector, and is connected to the detector though stainless steel pipes. The input\ngas is common to both detector arms up to a gas monitoring station located\njust outside the PHENIX intersection region, where it is split into separate\ninputs lines to the East and West detectors. Each detector has separate gas\n25\n\n\fFig. 19. Recirculating gas system used to supply and monitor pure CF4 gas to the\nHBD detector.\n\nreturns to the monitoring station. The flow rate was typically \u223c 3.75 l/min to\neach detector, and the operating pressure was \u223c1.4 Torr above atmospheric\npressure.\nIn order to measure and control the high gas purity required, extensive monitoring of the oxygen and water levels is implemented throughout the system.\nOxygen and water sensors (GE Panamatrics O2X1 and Kahn Cermet II) are\ninstalled in the Gas Mixing House to measure the levels of the input gas at\nthe source and the return gas before repurification. The Kahn Cermet II water sensors were chosen for their compatibility with CF4 . Additional sensors\nare also installed for the input and return gases in the monitoring station,\nwhich measure the water and oxygen levels approximately 50 meters from the\ndetector.\nThese sensors provide continuous information on the contaminant levels. However, their sensitivity at the low ppm levels achieved during normal operation\nis not sufficient to determine the true level of impurities in the gas. Therefore,\na completely independent monitoring system was built to measure the actual\nUV transmission of both the input gas and the output gas of each detector.\nThe gas transmission monitor is shown in Fig. 20 and also further described\nin [20,21]. It consists of a vacuum ultraviolet spectrometer (McPherson Model\n234/302) and a set of three transmission cells that are used to measure the\ntransmission of the common input gas and separate output gases of each detector. A scanning monochromator combined with a translatable mirror delivers\na collimated beam of monochromatic light from a deuterium lamp down one\nof three 51 cm long transmission cells equipped with a CsI photocathode pho26\n\n\fFig. 20. The gas transmission monitor system.\n\ntotube (Hamamatsu R6835) on the end. One transmission cell is used for\nmeasuring the input gas and two for the output gas. A portion of the beam is\nalso measured by a separate phototube in order to monitor the lamp intensity.\nThe phototubes are operated in a photodiode mode and their photocathode\ncurrents are measured using two Keithley 6487 picoammeters. The monochromator, translatable mirror, and readout of the picoammeters are controlled by\na Labview program running on a PC in the monitoring station.\nThe entire spectrometer and each transmission cell can be pumped and also\npurged with pure argon. After almost two years of operation of the spectrometer under vacuum, it was found that there was a significant loss in light intensity due to the buildup of deposits on the beam optics. All of the beam optics\nwere subsequently replaced and, during the last year of operation, the main\ncompartment of the spectrometer containing the beam optics was operated at\natmospheric pressure under a flow of pure argon. However, the transmission\ncells were still evacuated for reference scans in order to determine the CF4\ntransmission relative to vacuum.\nThe gas transmission is defined as the double ratio of the currents, I, in the\ncell and in the monitor PMTs. :\nT = (ICF4 (Cell)/Ivac (Cell))/(ICF4 (M on)/Ivac (M on))\nThe gas transmittance was measured continuously throughout each run, with\nscans being done sometimes several times a day to once a week or more as\nnecessary. A typical set of input and output transmission spectra is shown in\nFig. 21. Using the measured transmission values and the known absorption\ncross sections for water and oxygen (see Fig. 17), a fit is performed to determine the true impurity levels in the gas. The spectra are fit over a wavelength\nrange from 111-200 nm including a component due to the intrinsic absorp27\n\n\ftion in CF4 and components due to water and and oxygen impurities. This\nmethod not only allows a more precise determination of the actual impurity\nlevels, but gives a direct indication of the total integrated absorbance in the\ngas. The input spectrum shows virtually no additional absorbance other than\n\nFig. 21. UV transmission spectra for (top panel) the common input gas, (left panel)\nthe output gas from the East detector and (right panel) the output gas from the\nWest detector.\n\nthe intrinsic absorbance of the gas. The two output spectra exhibit a shape\nthat is dominated by water absorption with a small component of oxygen (see\nagain Fig. 17). As determined by these fits, the impurity levels of the input gas\nwere typically less than 2 ppm of both water and oxygen, and the output gas\ntypically showed 20-30 ppm of water and \u223c 2-3 ppm of oxygen. Fig. 22 shows\nthe integrated transmittance over the range from 114-180 nm for a roughly\nfive month time period during Run 10 at RHIC, and shows that the input gas\nwas in the range from 90-100%, and the output gas was in the range from\n80-90%. This was sufficient to keep the transmission loss of photoelectrons to\n. 5% throughout the entire run.\n\n6\n\nHigh voltage system\n\nThe high voltage supply for the HBD is based on the LeCroy 1450 high voltage system, but modified with a number of additional features to improve\n28\n\n\fFig. 22. Integrated gas transmission over the range from 114-180 nm for the input\ngas and east and west output gas for a five month time period during Run 10 at\nRHIC.\n\ncalibration, enhance voltage and current monitoring, and provide additional\ntrip protection capabilities. The main high voltage supply is a LeCroy 1458\nmainframe equipped with a set of six LeCroy 1471N high voltage modules\ncapable of supplying up to 200 \u03bcA at 6 kV. Two channels of a 1471N unit are\nused for each HBD module, one to power the voltage divider for the GEMs\nand another to supply high voltage to the mesh. The configuration of the\nvoltage divider and power supply to the GEM stack and the mesh is shown\nin Fig. 23. The 20 M\u03a9 resistors in series with each of the 28 segmented HV\nstrips of the GEM are mounted on the GEM foils, while all other resistors are\noutside the HBD vessel. The internal resistors are used to prevent a short in\none strip from affecting the high voltage to other strips in the same GEM. As\ndescribed below, if a short occurs in one strip, the external divider resistor\ncan be easily changed to compensate for the short, keeping the total effective\nresistance across the GEM constant.\nEach of the three GEMs in a stack is powered by its own separate divider.\nThe values for the divider resistors are chosen to provide equal voltages across\neach of the GEMs, relatively high fields in the two transfer gaps, and an even\nlarger field in the induction gap, in order to improve the electron collection\nefficiency in the three gaps [7]. This effectively results in higher overall gain\nof the triple GEM stack without increasing the voltage across the GEMs. The\ntotal resistance of each leg of the divider is 84 M\u03a9, giving a total resistance of\n28 M\u03a9 for the three legs in parallel. In order to achieve a typical operating gain\nof 4000, the total applied voltage to the top of the divider chain is \u223c4000 V,\nresulting in a total current of \u223c143 \u03bcA, and an applied voltage across each of\nthe GEMs of \u223c476 V, which is comfortably below the breakdown voltage for\nthe GEMs in CF4 [7].\n29\n\n\fFig. 23. Voltage divider and power supply configuration used to supply high voltage\nto the GEM stack and mesh of each HBD module. Values of the resistors are: R0 =\n2 M\u03a9, R1 = 20 M\u03a9, R2 = 26 M\u03a9, R3 = 46 M\u03a9, R4 = 52 M\u03a9 and R-GEM = 10 M\u03a9.\nThe 20 M\u03a9 resistors on the GEM modules are mounted on the GEM foils inside\nthe detector.\n\nA number of additional features are built into the high voltage system to\nprevent excessive voltage from being applied to the GEMs or between the top\nGEM and the mesh. A pair of back-to-back Zener diodes installed between\nthe mesh and the upper electrode of the top GEM limit the voltage to less\nthan 250 V to ensure that no voltage capable of causing breakdown in this\ngap could be be applied. In addition, the 1471Ns HV modules were modified\nto incorporate a trip detection circuit that is able to recognize a trip in one\nchannel and initiate a trip in another. This is used to trip the mesh of a\ngiven module if the GEM tripped or vice versa. The output of this circuit\nis connected to a custom designed \"Relay Board\" that utilizes high voltage\nrelays to disconnect a tripped channel from the high voltage power supply and\nquickly discharge the stored energy in both the GEM stack and mesh.\nThe high voltage is controlled by a High Voltage Control and Monitoring\nSystem (HVC) [22] that is designed to provide precision control of the high\nvoltage to the detector, allowing programmable ramps, setting of standby\nand operational voltages for different gain settings, modification of the high\nvoltage to compensate for pressure and temperature (P/T) changes, monitoring and recording of all voltages and currents, including storage of all values\ninto a data base, and several modes of trip detection and recovery. The system is based on modern Optimal Control Theory and is implemented in a\n30\n\n\fclient-server environment using mainly Java. The overall system is shown in\nFig. 24. The HBD HV Client/Server interacts through the main PHENIX\nHV Client/Server to communicate with the LeCroy mainframe and perform\nthe basic HV control functions, and also provides a GUI to interact with the\noperators in the PHENIX Control room, or with other operators connected\nremotely.\n\nFig. 24. HBD High Voltage Control System with its Client/Server configuration.\nThe HBD HV server runs on one of the online computers in the PHENIX control\nroom, while the client can be either run locally or remotely.\n\nIn addition to the factory calibration, an in situ calibration of each 1471\nmodule was done using the actual divider chain of each GEM. This allows\nprecise monitoring of the current in each divider and enables detection of any\nadditional current drawn by the GEM to a level of \u223c100 nA, which would\nbe an indication of a short, or partial short, in any of the GEM modules. If\nsuch an increase in current is detected, the HVC initiates a \"virtual trip\" and\nnotifies the operator that intervention is required. This feature is in addition\nto the normal fast trip detection provided by the 1471 which causes a trip if\nthe peak current exceeds a certain value for a short time, as in the case of a\ndischarge. During normal operation, the fast trip thresholds are set at 20 \u03bcA,\nand the slow or virtual trip thresholds are set to \u223c 1.5% or \u223c2 \u03bcA, above the\nstanding current value.\nIt should be noted that if a partial short does occur, it does not necessarily\ntrip the power supply, but results in a small increase in current drawn by the\n31\n\n\fdivider chain due to the appearance of an additional resistance in parallel with\nthe nominal 10 M\u03a9 resistor across each of the GEMs. However, the internal\nresistors in series with each of the segmented HV strips limit this parallel\nresistance to 20 M\u03a9, even in the case of a dead short. In either case, a partial or\ncomplete short lowers the resistance, and hence the voltage across the affected\nGEM, thus lowering its gain. These types of shorts can be compensated for\nby measuring the total internal resistance of the individual GEM (20 M\u03a9 plus\nthe resistance of the short) and changing the external 10 M\u03a9 resistor to an\nappropriate value to restore the total resistance to 10 M\u03a9. Up to two complete\nshorts can be compensated for in this way without having to change any other\nresistors in the divider chain. In practice, during the 2010 RHIC run, only two\nmodules showed two complete shorts and two showed partial shorts, all of\nwhich were compensated for by simply changing a single external resistor.\n\n7\n\nHBD operation and monitoring\n\nA number of parameters need to be carefully adjusted and monitored to ensure\ngood performance of the detector over a run which is typically 4-6 months long.\nThese include setting the HV for each detector module to reach the desired operating gain, optimizing the reverse bias field in the gap between the mesh and\nthe top GEM to achieve maximum hadron rejection while keeping maximum\nphotoelectron collection efficiency, monitoring the gas gain variations due to\npressure and temperature changes, and monitoring the gas quality and photocathode sensitivity. The monitoring of the gas quality was already discussed\nin Section 5. The other parameters are discussed in the present section.\n\n7.1\n\nGain determination\n\nThe excellent noise performance of the readout electronics (see Section 8.1)\nallows the detector to be operated at a relatively low gain. During the RHIC\nruns of 2009 an 2010 the HBD was operated at a gain of \u223c4,000. This gain is\nachieved with a voltage across the GEM \u2206VGEM \u223c470 V, which is comfortably\nbelow the breakdown voltage of the GEMs (typically around 550 V in CF4\n[7]).\nThe gain of each detector module is conveniently and precisely determined by\nexploiting the scintillation light produced by charged particles traversing the\nCF4 radiator. The scintillation signal is easily identified in the low amplitude\npart of the pulse height distribution as illustrated in Fig. 25. In the FB mode\n(upper panels) the spectrum has two clear components: a steep exponential\ndistribution at very low amplitudes attributed to scintillation photons and a\n32\n\n\fHits/event\n\nHits/event\n\nlonger tail at higher amplitudes which is due to ionization of the gas in the drift\ngap. When the detector is operated in RB mode (lower panels), the latter is\nlargely suppressed as the ionization charges get repelled to the mesh, whereas\nthe exponential part due to scintillation remains unaffected. The scintillation\nsignal has another characteristic feature: it produces single pad hits which are\nnot associated to any charged track identified in the outer PHENIX detectors.\n\nForward bias\n\n10\n1\n-1\n\n1\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-3\n\n10-40\n\nForward bias\nzoom\n\n10\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n10-40\n\n1000\n\n20\n\n40\n\nReverse bias\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-3\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n100\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-40\n\n80\n\nReverse bias\nzoom\n\n10\n\n1\n\n60\n\nADC counts\nHits/event\n\nHits/event\n\nADC counts\n\n10-40\n\n1000\n\nADC counts\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nADC counts\n\nFig. 25. Pulse height distribution in one detector module in FB (upper panels) and\nRB (lower panels) modes. The ordinate is normalized to represent the number of\nhits per event.\n\nThe gain G of the detector is obtained from:\nG=\n\nS \u22121\n<m>\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S is the slope of the exponential shape at low amplitudes and < m >\nis the average number of scintillation photons in a fired pad. In p+p collisions\n< m > is very close to 1 and the gain is readily given by the inverse slope of the\nexponential distribution: G \u223c S\u22121 . In Au+Au collisions however, the inverse\nslope increases with the number of charged particles traversing the detector\nas shown in the top and bottom right panels of Fig. 26. Due to the large\nscintillation yield of CF4 , as the number of tracks increases, the probability\nof scintillation pile up increases and the primary charge in the scintillation\nsignal < m > corresponds on the average to more than one photoelectron.\nAssuming that the number n of scintillation photons per pad follows a Poisson\n33\n\n\fdistribution P(n) with an average \u03bc, then < m > is given by:\nP\n\nnP (n)\n\u03bc\n=\n1 \u2212 P (0)\nn\u22651 P (n)\n\n< m >= Pn\u22651\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P(0) is the probability to have no hit in a pad: P(0) = e\u2212\u03bc .

The same procedure was also used for the online determination of\nthe gain in Au+Au collisions but selecting only very peripheral events. In\nboth cases, the real gain calculated offline with the extrapolation procedure\noutlined above is only a few percent lower.\n\n7.2\n\nGain equilibration\n\nThe detector gain is not uniform over its entire active area. There are two types\nof gain variations. There are spatial gain variations across each GEM's area\nthat arise from small changes in the size of the holes and from the mechanical\ntolerances of the various gaps. The second type of gain variations is global gain\nvariations as a function of time which are due to changes of the atmospheric\npressure and the temperature.\nGain uniformity, both in space and time, is essential for the HBD performance\nsince its analog response is used to distinguish single from double electron hits.\nIn order to correct for the spatial gain variations we use a gain equilibration\nprocedure which brings all the pads in a given module to the average gain\n<G> in that module. Using a large statistics run, the average gain <G> is\ncalculated from the gain Gi of each pad i determined using the procedure\noutlined in the previous section. The signal ai in a given pad is then corrected\naccording to the expression:\nai \u2192 ai\n\n<G>\nGi\n\n(4)\n\nNumber of pads\n\nAn example showing the spread of gain values across the pads of one module,\nbefore and after pad gain equilibration, is shown in Fig. 27. One can see that\n\nPad gain equilibration:\n\n35\n\nbefore\n\n30\n\nafter\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n00\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nGain\n\nFig. 27. Gain distribution of all pads in one module before and after equilibration.\nThe correction factors <G>/Gi were derived from a different run.\n\n35\n\n\fbefore equilibration the spread of gains is quite large with an rms of 0.45 which\ngets reduced to 0.10 after equilibration.\n\n7.3\n\nGain variations with P/T\n\nThe gas gain in CF4 is very sensitive to variations of the gas density i.e. changes\nin P/T. The temperature of the detector is maintained fairly constant at 21o C\nby the temperature control in the experimental hall. However, the gas pressure\nvaries since the detector is kept at a constant overpressure of 1.4 Torr above the\natmospheric pressure and the atmospheric pressure varies greatly according\nto weather conditions. The detector is quite sensitive to these changes as can\nbe seen in Fig. 28. A change of P/T by \u223c6% induces a factor of 2 change in\nthe gas gain. The solid line represents a fit of the data with an exponential\nfunction demonstrating that the gain varies exponentially with P/T.\n\nRelative gain\n\n10\n\nP/T dependence of gain\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n2.35\n\n2.4\n\n2.45\n\n2.5\n\n2.55\n\n2.6\n\n2.65\n\nP/T (Torr/K)\n\nFig. 28. Relative gain variations in CF4 due to P/T changes. The gain is normalized\nto 1 at P/T = 2.55 (Torr/K). The line represents a fit of the data points with an\nexponential function.\n\nTo avoid these large excursions of the gain, we defined 5 pre-determined P/T\nwindows such that over each of them the gain varies by not more than 20%.\nWe compensated the gain variations by automatically varying the operating\nHV whenever the P/T values crossed the window boundaries. The left panel\nof Fig. 29 shows the applied voltage to a given detector module and the P/T\nvalues over an extended period of 45 days during Run-10. The measured gain\nof the same module during the same time period is shown in the right panel,\ndemonstrating that the gain is kept constant within \u00b110%.\n36\n\n\fFig. 29. Left panel: HV applied to one HBD module and P/T values during a period\nof 45 d of the 200 GeV section of the 2010 RHIC run. Five distinct windows (T1 to\nT5) in P/T are defined and the high voltage control program applies a custom set\nof voltages to the detector for each of these windows. Right panel: Measured gain\nof the same module during the same period of time.\n\n7.4\n\nReverse bias\n\nOptimizing the reverse bias mode of operation is of prime importance for the\nperformance of the detector. As shown in [8], the ionization signal in the gap\nbetween the mesh and the top GEM drops sharply as the field is reversed and\nthe primary charges get repelled towards the mesh. The signal drops quickly\nby almost a factor of 10 within \u223c10 V, while the photoelectron collection\nefficiency drops much more slowly. Achieving maximum hadron rejection while\nkeeping maximum photoelectron collection requires setting the relative voltage\nbetween the mesh and the top GEM very close to 0 with a precision of a few\nvolts out of \u223c4000 V applied to the voltage divider, which is far beyond\nthe precision of the absolute high voltage values of the LeCroy 1471N power\nsupplies. An accurate and fast method to adjust the mesh HV with respect to\nthe GEM divider voltage was developed that exploits the scintillation signal.\nFor each module, a series of short measurements were done where the gain was\nkept constant and the voltage across the gap between the mesh and the top\nGEM was varied in steps of 5 V. An example of such a voltage scan is shown\nin Fig. 30 for one particular module. For a meaningful comparison among the\ndifferent spectra, the ordinate is normalized to represent the number of hits\nper event. One sees that the yield of the scintillation signal remains unaffected\nwhen the voltage of the mesh varies from +5 to -20 V with respect to the top\nGEM, whereas the ionization signal sharply drops within this voltage scan.\nFor this module the optimal mesh voltage is -10 V with respect to the top\nGEM, i.e. the minimal voltage needed that produces the maximal reduction\nof the ionization tail.\n37\n\n\fFig. 30. Pulse height spectra of one detector module in a scan from +5 to -20 V of\nthe relative voltage between the mesh and the top GEM.\n\n7.5\n\nMonitoring photocathode sensitivity\n\nMaintaining high quantum efficiency of the CsI photocathodes was crucial\nfor achieving maximum photoelecton yield and it was therefore important to\nmonitor their stability and performance throughout the run. Monitoring was\naccomplished using two scintillation cubes mounted inside the two halves of\nthe detector described in Section 3.6. Alpha particles from the 241 Am source\nmounted inside the cube produce scintillation light which is focused on the\nCsI photocathode in one location inside each detector. The amount of light is\nsufficient to produce \u223c 4-5 photoelectrons, which have a Poisson distribution\nthat can be used to determine the photoelectron yield. In addition, the 55 Fe\n\nFig. 31. Photoelectron yield measured with the scintillation cube in the West detector in November of 2008 and again in May of 2010, showing no significant change\nover this 18 month period.\n\nsource mounted in the cube in approximately the same location provides a\nmeans to determine the gas gain, which allows a determination of the peak of\nthe Poisson distribution in terms of photoelectrons. The number of photoelec38\n\n\ftrons determined using the gas gain can also be compared to the number given\nby the shape of the Poisson distribution convoluted with the fluctuations due\nto gas gain and electronic noise. The two methods generally agreed quite well.\nMeasuring the photoelectron yield from the cube requires setting up a special readout configuration that is rather disruptive to the normal operating\nmode of the detector, and consequently, the measurements of the photoelectron yield from the cubes were not done very frequently (typically only once\nor twice per run). However, each time the measurements were done, we observed no change in the photoelectron yield, and hence the quantum efficiency\nof the photocathodes, from when the photocathodes were originally produced.\nFig. 31 shows the photoelectron distribution measured with the scintillation\ncube in the West detector in November of 2008 and in May of 2010, demonstrating that the photoelectron yield of 4.6 \u00b1 0.2 did not change over this\nperiod of more than 18 months.\n\n8\n8.1\n\nPerformance\nNoise\n\n2080\n\nCounts\n\nMean [ch]\n\nThe signals from the GEM readout system are amplified by pre-amplifiers installed outside of the HBD detector, and sent to the front end module (FEM),\n\u223c5 m away from the detector, as described in Section 4.

The pedestal mean values sit close to the middle of\nthe dynamic range (4096 ADC counts). As shown in the figure, the noise level\nis almost the same in all pads with a typical sigma value of \u223c1.5 ADC channels. The histograms on the right of Fig. 32 show the pedestal distributions\nfor one single pad demonstrating a Gaussian distribution over more than three\norders of magnitude. To reduce the data volume, an online zero-suppression\nwas applied requiring the pad signal to be larger than 5 ADC channels i.e.\n\u223c 3\u03c3 larger than the pedestal mean.\n\n2200\n\n105\n\nFADC histogram\n\nCounts\n\nADC channel\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 33 shows a typical FADC histogram for an electron signal\nin the detector.

In the offline\nanalysis, the signal is defined as the difference of the samples (8+9+10) (0+1+2). The zero-suppression is applied to the difference of sample 0 and\n8. In the right plot, the difference of sample 8 and 0 is shown. The width of\nthe distribution is narrower than the sample 8 itself. This is because the low\nfrequency component of the noise is eliminated by subtracting the 0th sample.\nThis subtraction also makes it possible to calculate the net charge when signal\npile-up occurs.\n\n8.2\n\nPattern recognition\n\nThe pad size (hexagon shape with side a = 15.5 mm and area = 6.2 cm2 ) was\nchosen to be comparable but smaller than the blob size (area = 9.9 cm2 ) such\nthat an incident electron produces a signal distributed over a small cluster of\na few pads. For single electrons the cluster size is typically 2-3 pads whereas\na somewhat larger cluster is produced by close e+ e\u2212 pairs from \u03b3 conversions\nor \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays. On the other hand a hadron typically produces a single\npad hit.\n40\n\n\fYield\n\nYield\n\nMatching, 6\\\n\nMatching, 6Z\n\n40000\n30000\n\n30000\n20000\n20000\n\n10000\n10000\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n-20\n\n0.1\n\n6\\ (rad)\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n6Z (cm)\n\nFig. 34. Matching of electron tracks in \u03a6 (left panel) and Z (right panel) directions.\nThe solid lines represent the fits to a Gaussian function.\n\nA simple cluster finding algorithm is used to identify electron candidates in\nthe detector. Clusters are built around a seed pad having a charge larger than\na selected threshold (typically 3-5 photoelectrons). In a first step, the fired\npads among the first six neighbors of the seed are added to the seed. A pad\nis considered fired if it has a signal larger than typically one photoelectron.\nIn a second step clusters that have in common at least one fired pad are\nmerged together to form a single larger cluster. The total charge of the cluster\nis determined as the sum of charges of the pads assigned to the cluster. The\ncenter of gravity of the cluster is taken as the hit position of the incident\nparticle.\n\n8.3\n\nPosition resolution\n\nThe HBD position resolution is determined from the matching of tracks defined\nin the PHENIX central arm detectors to HBD clusters. Fig. 34 shows the\nmatching distribution i.e. the distance between the track projection point onto\nthe HBD photocathode plane and the closest HBD cluster, in the \u03a6 (left panel)\nand Z (right panel) directions. These distributions were obtained from the\np+p run of 2009 using a highly pure sample of electron pairs originating from\n\u03c0 0 Dalitz decays (with a mass me+ e\u2212 = 50-150 MeV/c2 ) fully reconstructed\nin the PHENIX central arms. The matching distributions have almost no\nbackground of random matching as expected from a highly pure sample of\nelectrons and from a very efficient detector. The electron detection efficiency\nwill be discussed in Section 8.7.\nThe distributions exhibit a Gaussian shape as demonstrated by the fits in\nthe figure. They are used to align the HBD with respect to the central arm\ndetectors by requiring the centroid of the distributions to be centered at 0.

Matching resolution of electron tracks \u03c3\u03a6 (left panel) and \u03c3Z (right panel)\nas a function of momentum.\n\n\u03c3 values of the fits are presented as function of the track momentum in Fig. 35.\nThey show the expected 1/p dependence at low momenta and a constant value\nat high momenta representing the intrinsic detector resolution. The latter\nis dominated by the size of the hexagonal pads.\u221aThe position resolution of\nsingle pad hits is expected to be given by 2a/ 12= 0.9 cm. For electron\ntracks, the center of gravity hit determination leads to a better resolution\nresulting in the asymptotic \u03c3\u03a6 value of 8 mrad or 4.8 mm. This value is\ntaken as the HBD intrinsic position resolution since the central arm track\nis determined with much better precision. In the Z direction the asymptotic\nresolution \u03c3Z of \u223c1.05 cm results from the quadratic sum of the intrinsic\ndetector resolution and the Z resolution of the vertex position which is about\n1 cm in p+p collisions.\n\n8.4\n\nHadron response and hadron rejection factor\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 36 shows the HBD response to hadrons in the FB and RB\nmodes. Hadrons identified in the central arm detectors are projected into the\nHBD and the amplitude of the closest cluster within \u00b13\u03c3 matching windows in\n\u03a6 and Z is plotted. The signal is expressed in terms of the primary ionization\ncharge, using the measured detector gain. The FB spectrum is well reproduced\nby a Landau distribution characteristic of the energy loss of minimum ionizing\nparticles. The measured mean amplitude is consistent with an energy loss of\ndE/dx = 7 keV/cm [23] and a primary ionization of \u223c 50 eV/ ion-pair.\nIn RB, there is a sharp drop in the pulse height as the primary charges get\nrepelled towards the mesh. In this mode, the pulse height distribution results\nfrom the collection of (i) ionization charges from a thin layer of about 100 \u03bcm\nabove the first GEM surface and (ii) ionization charges from the entire first\n42\n\n\fHadron rejection factor\n\nYield\n\nHadron response\n\n600\n\nreverse bias\nforward bias\n\n100\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\nPrimary charge [pe]\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nCharge threshold [pe]\n\nFig. 36.

The hadron rejection factor derived from the hadron spectra measured in RB is shown in the right panel of Fig. 36 as function of the charge\nthreshold. The rejection is limited by the long Landau tail and depends on\nthe charge threshold that can be applied without compromising too much the\nsingle electron detection efficiency. Rejection factors of the order of 50 can be\nachieved with an amplitude threshold of \u223c 10 e.\n\n8.5\n\nSingle versus double electron response\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the combinatorial background originates\nmainly from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays and \u03b3 conversions. Most of these pairs are reconstructed in the HBD as a double electron cluster (overlapping electron and\npositron hits) due to their small opening angle and the coarse granularity of\nthe HBD pad readout. The HBD exploits these two facts and reduces the combinatorial background by rejecting central arm electron tracks if the associated\nhit in the HBD has a double hit response or if there is a nearby hit within\nan opening angle of typically 200 mrad. This is done by two cuts, an analog\ncut and a close hit cut, respectively. The analog cut requires good separation\nbetween single and double electron hits, whereas the close hit cut requires\ngood hadron rejection in order not to veto the signal with the overwhelming\nyield of hadrons.\nIn order to study the HBD response to single and double electrons, we select a\nsample of pairs in the mass region below 0.15 GeV/c2 where the combinatorial\n43\n\n\fYield\n\nYield\n\nOpen pairs\nm < 0.15 GeV/c2\nCluster charge\n\n4000\n\nClose pairs\nm < 0.15 GeV/c2\nCluster charge\n\n40000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n20000\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\nCharge (p.e.)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCharge (p.e.)\n\nFig. 37. HBD response to single electrons (left panel)and to an unresolved double\nelectron hit (right panel).\n\nbackground is negligible. This sample is divided into two categories: if both the\nelectron and positron tracks reconstructed in the PHENIX central arms are\nmatched within 3\u03c3 in both \u03a6 and Z directions to two separate HBD clusters\nwe interpret this as the response of the HBD to single electrons. If they are\nmatched to the same HBD cluster we interpret it as the HBD response to a\ndouble electron. The HBD single electron response is shown in the left panel\nof Fig. 37, whereas the HBD double electron response is shown in the right\npanel. The former is peaked at around 20 photoelectrons, whereas the latter is\npeaked at about twice that value, at \u223c40 photoelectrons. The mean value of\nthe tagged single electrons is significantly higher, probably reflecting the fact\nthat this sample contains a small fraction of double electron hits. We therefore\ntake the peak values of 20 and 40 photoelectrons to represent the mean HBD\nresponse to single and double electrons respectively.\nThe comparison of left panels of Figs. 36 and 37 shows a very good separation\nbetween single electrons and hadrons in RB. A large fraction of the hadrons\ncan be rejected by applying a low amplitude cut to the HBD signal.\n8.6\n\nFigure of merit N0 and photon yield\n\nThe average number of photoelectrons Npe in a Cherenkov counter with a\nradiator of length L is given by:\nNpe = N0 \u00d7 L/\u03b3 2th\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3 th is the average Cherenkov threshold over the sensitive bandwidth of\nthe detector and N0 is the figure of merit of the Cherenkov counter.\nThe ideal figure of merit, i.e. in the absence of any losses, is obtained by\n44\n\n\fintegrating the CsI quantum efficiency (QE) times the CF4 gas transmission\n(TG ) over the sensitive bandwidth of the detector. The HBD is sensitive to\nphotons between the ionization threshold of the CsI photocathode (\u223c6.2 eV)\nand the CF4 cut-off (the 50% cut-off point is at \u223c11.1 eV and the transmission\ndrops to zero at \u223c12.4 eV). For the CsI QE in CF4 we use our measured values\ngiven in [8] where it was shown that the QE increases linearly from 6.2 eV\nto 10.2 eV (corresponding to the highest energy where it was measured). We\nassume the same linear dependence to extrapolate the QE from 10.2 eV till the\nabsolute cut-off at 12.4 eV. For TG we use our measured values (see below).\nWe then obtain an ideal value for N0 of:\nN0ideal\n\n= 370\n\nZ 12.4\n6.2\n\nQE(E) * TG * dE = 714 cm\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nIn the actual detector, this figure gets degraded by a number of factors that\nreduce the overall photoelectron yield. These include the transparency of the\nradiator gas, TG , the optical transparency of the entrance mesh, TM , the optical transparency of the top GEM (which reduces the effective photocathode\narea), TP C , the loss of photoelectrons due to the reverse bias mode of operation, \u000fRB , the transport efficiency of the photoelectrons, once extracted from\nthe photocathode, into the holes of the GEM, \u000fT r , and the loss of signal due\nto the pad amplitude threshold that is applied to the readout, \u000fth . Some of\nthese efficiencies are wavelength independent and straightforward to measure\nor estimate, while others are wavelength dependent and may have greater uncertainties. In the following we discuss all these factors and quote their average\nvalues in Table 3.\nThe optical transparency of the mesh, TM , is simply determined by the opacity\nof the wire mesh and was calculated to be 88.5%.\nThe optical transparency of the photocathode, TP C , gives the effective area\nof the photocathode and is determined by the hole pattern in the GEM foil.\nHowever, the GEM holes are not perfectly cylindrical and have a tapered\nshape that consists of an outer hole in the copper layer and an inner hole\nin the kapton. By measuring the photocathode efficiency of a solid planar\nphotocathode and comparing it with that of a photocathode deposited on a\nGEM foil, we determined that the effective photocathode area of the GEM is\ngiven by the average of the inner and outer hole diameters. This leads to an\naverage value for the optical transparency of the GEM foil of 81% as given in\nTable 3.\nThe radiator gas transparency TG consists of the intrinsic transmission of\nCF4 combined with the absorption caused by any impurities such as oxygen\nand water. The intrinsic transmission of the HBD gas is essentially given\nby the transmission of input gas as shown in the top panel of Fig. 21, and\n45\n\n\fthe transmission including the oxygen and water impurities in the output\ngas is shown in the lower panels of Fig. 21. The shape of the transmission\nspectrum at the shortest wavelengths is not measured with high precision due\nto limitations in the light output of the transmission monitor. In order to\nobtain the transmission down to the UV cutoff, it is assumed that the shape\nof the spectrum is a symmetric S-shaped curve with a 50% transmission point\nat 111 nm, which is then extrapolated down to an absolute cut-off of 100 nm.\nWe estimate that this approximation leads to an uncertainty of \u223c10 % in our\nestimation of the photoelectron yield. Using typical transmission curves with\n20 ppm of water and 3 ppm of oxygen, we obtain an average value of 89% for\nthe gas transmission as given in Table 3.\nThe transport efficiency, \u000fT r , for transferring photoelectrons produced on the\nphotocathode to the holes in the GEMs was measured in [24]. The value is\nindependent of wavelength and is given as 80% in Table 3.\nFinally, the losses due to reverse bias operation, \u000fRB , as described in [8], were\nminimized by optimizing the reverse bias operating point for each module, as\ndescribed in Section 7.4. These losses, along with the loss of signal due to the\namplitude threshold applied in the readout, \u000fth , is estimated to be 90% as\ngiven in Table 3.\nWith all of these losses, the expected figure of merit is computed to be\n= 328 cm\u22121 with an estimated uncertainty of 14%. The uncertainty\nNcalc\n0\ncomes primarily from the CF4 transmission near its cut-off, and from the extrapolation of the CsI QE from from 10.2 eV to the CF4 cut-off. Using the\ncalculated average \u03b3 th = 28.8 [25] and an average radiator length of L = 51.5\ncm, the expected number of photoelectrons is 20.4\u00b12.9. A more accurate calculation based on the convolution of the QE with the gas transmission and\n\u03b3th (which varies with wavelength due to the chromatic aberration) according\nto:\nNpe = 370 * L * TM * TP C * \u000fRB * \u000fT r * \u000fth\n\nZ 12.4\n6.2\n\n2\nQE * TG * *dE/\u03b3th\n\n(7)\n\ngives a very similar value of Npe = 20.3\u00b12.8.\nThe experimental number was obtained from a sample of resolved Dalitz pairs\nas defined in Section 8.5, i.e. pairs reconstructed in the central arms with a\nmass me+ e\u2212 < 150 MeV/c2 matched to resolved clusters in the HBD. As shown\nin Fig. 37, the HBD response to these single electrons gives a most probable\nvalue of Nmeas\n\u223c 20 photoelectrons corresponding to a measured figure of\npe\nmeas\nmerit N0\n= 322 cm\u22121 , in very good agreement with the calculated values.\nThe observed N0 value is very large compared to those achieved in any other\ngas Cherenkov counter [26,27,28,29].\n46\n\n\fTable 3\nFigure of merit and Cherenkov photon yield.\n714 cm\u22121\n\nN0 ideal value\nOptical transparency of mesh\n\n88.5%\n\nOptical transparency of photocathode\n\n81%\n\nRadiator gas transparency\n\n89%\n\nTransport efficiency\n\n80%\n\nReverse bias and pad threshold\n\n90%\n\nN0 calculated value\n\n328\u00b1 46 cm\u22121\n\nNpe expected\n\n20.4\u00b1 2.9\n\nNpe measured\n\n20\n322 cm\u22121\n\nN0 measured value\n\n8.7\n\nSingle electron efficiency\n\nThe HBD single electron identification efficiency is a key factor for the dilepton\nphysics with the HBD. The electrons reconstructed in the PHENIX central\narms cannot be used to determine the HBD single electron efficiency since most\nof them do not originate from the vertex but from downstream \u03b3 conversions.\nWe have used two methods to determine the HBD electron efficiency. In the\nfirst method, we select a sample of reconstructed \u03c0 0 Dalitz open pairs with\nlow mass where the number of the conversions is relatively small and where\nthe combinatorial background is negligible, namely 25 < me+ e\u2212 < 50 MeV/c2 .\nThe conversions in this mass window are effectively removed by applying a\ncut on the orientation \u03c6V of the pairs in the magnetic field [5]. The electrons\nin this sample are matched to hits in the HBD within a 3\u03c3 matching window\nand the ratio of the matched hits to the total number of electrons define the\nHBD single electron efficiency. This ratio is plotted in Fig. 38 as function\nof the \u03c6V cut. The figure demonstrates that the efficiency averaged over the\nentire detector is close to \u223c 90%. Most of the losses occur near the edges of\nthe detector modules. Excluding the boundaries results in an efficiency close\nto 100 %.\nIn the second method, we use the sample of fully reconstructed e+ e\u2212 pairs\nin the high mass region (me+ e\u2212 > 2.5 GeV/c2 ) from the p+p run of 2009.\nThis sample is dominated by J/\u03c8 decay into e+ e\u2212 pairs with a relatively low\nbackground, consisting of combinatorial pairs and correlated pairs from the\nsemileptonic decays of charmed mesons.

The combinatorial background\nis shown in both panels by the open circles.\n\ncollisions using the PHENIX central arms only. The combinatorial background\nevaluated by a mixed event technique is shown by the open circles. The right\npanel shows the same mass spectrum after requiring a matching of the electron\nand positron tracks to hits in the HBD. The matching to the HBD effectively\nremoves conversions occurring downstream of the HBD and misidentified electrons in the central arms and consequently the combinatorial background is\nconsiderably reduced as demonstrated in the right panel. On the other hand,\nthe J/\u03c8 yield is almost preserved. A proper evaluation of the J/\u03c8 yield can\nbe obtained by fitting the mass spectrum (after subtraction of the combina48\n\n\ftorial background) in the vicinity of the J/\u03c8 peak with a Gaussian function\n(for the J/\u03c8) plus an exponential function for the open charm contribution.\nComparing the so extracted J/\u03c8 yield before and after matching to the HBD,\ngives also a single electron efficiency of \u223c 90% for the entire HBD detector.\n\n9\n\nSummary\n\nWe described the concept, construction, operation and performance of the\nHadron Blind Detector that was developed for the PHENIX experiment at\nRHIC. The HBD is a Cherenkov detector with a 50 cm long CF4 radiator\nconnected in a windowless configuration to a triple GEM coupled to a pad\nreadout and with a CsI photocathode layer evaporated on the top face of\nthe GEM stack. The detector was successfully operated in the 2009 and 2010\nRHIC runs where large samples of p+p and Au+Au collisions, respectively,\nwere recorded. The detector showed very good performance in terms of noise,\nstability, position resolution, hadron rejection, single vs. double hit recognition\nand single electron detection efficiency. The novel concept of using CF4 in a\nwindowless configuration results in an unprecedented bandwidth of sensitivity\nfrom 6.2 eV (the threshold of the CsI photocathode) up to 11.1 eV (the CF4\ncut-off). This translated in a measured figure of merit N0 of \u223c330 cm\u22121 , much\nhigher that in any other existing gas Cherenkov detector.\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to the PHENIX Collaboration for their support and help\nduring the various phases of the HBD upgrade project.
