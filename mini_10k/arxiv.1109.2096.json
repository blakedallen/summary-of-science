Introduction\nThe nature of dark matter and dark energy is one of the most important issues today in physics. There are strong observational evidences in\nastrophysics and cosmology for the existence of these two exotic components\nof the cosmic energy budget, indicating that about 95% of the Universe is\ncomposed of dark matter (about 25%) and dark energy (about 70%), but no\ndirect detection has been reported until now. The usual candidates to dark\nmatter (neutralinos and axions, for example) and dark energy (cosmological\nconstant, quintessence, etc.) lead to very robust scenarios, but at same time\nthey must face theoretical and observational issues. For recent reviews on\nthe subject, see for example [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nAn interesting proposal concerning the nature of dark matter and dark\nenergy are the unification models. According to the latter, the whole dark\nsector is a manifestation of a single entity. The paradigm is a perfect fluid\nmodel called Chaplygin gas [6], but recently it has also been shown that\nviscous models may lead to unification scenarios [7]. In spite of their great\nappealing, however, unification models suffer from severe problems when\nconfronted with observations, since the parameter estimations from different\ntests lead to contradictory values [8]. One way to surmount this conflict is to\nencode the unification model in a scalar-tensor framework, the exotic fluid\nbeing described by a self-interacting scalar field. It is not easy to implement\nthis idea, since a canonical self-interacting scalar field has a sound speed\nEmail address: fabris@pq.cnpq.br, daoudah8@yahoo.fr,\noliver.piattella@ufes.br (J. C. Fabris, M. Hamani Daouda, O. F. Piattella)\n\nPreprint submitted to Physics Letters B\n\nMay 29, 2018\n\n\fequal to the speed of light, and it cannot represent dark matter in the past\nevolution of the universe, as required by the unification program [9].\nA scalar model that is able to represent a realization of dark matter and\ndark energy can be obtained with non-canonical self-interacting scalar fields.\nOne example is a scalar field obeying the structure of Rastall's theory, for\nwhich the usual conservation law for the matter content is modified [10].\nThe price to pay is the loss of a Lagrangian formulation, at least in the\ncontext of Riemannian geometry. In Rastall's theory a new dimensionless\nparameter \u03b3 is introduced, which measures the departure from the usual\nequations of General Relativity. When \u03b3 = 1, the General Relativity theory\nis recovered. As in the case of other unification scenarios, the theory is able\nto satisfactorily reproduce the kinematic background observational tests (e.g.\nbased on type Ia supernovae surveys), but essentially reduces to General\nRelativity if a hydrodynamical approach is used for the fluid obeying the\nnew conservation laws and the matter power spectrum data are used [11].\nHowever, the agreement improves if a non-canonical scalar field is employed\ninstead of a fluid. Moreover, if \u03b3 = 2 this non-canonical scalar field may\nbehave as dark matter, and may lead to a unification scenario [12].\nCan Rastall's theory pass another important test, represented by the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect? In order to answer this question, the gravitational\npotential \u03a6 must be analysed. Using the newtonian gauge, we find an astonishing property of Rastall's theory: in a scenario with just one component,\ngiven by the non-canonical Rastall scalar field, only homogeneous solutions\nfor \u03a6 are admitted, unless \u03b3 = 1. But homogeneous solutions for \u03a6 are not\nreal perturbations, since they can be re-absorbed in the background metric\nthrough a suitable reformulation of the background functions. Thus, the\ncase \u03b3 = 1 seems to be forced. This fundamental drawback can be cured if a\ntwo-fluid model is formulated: one scalar field obeying the modified conservation laws, and a fluid obeying the canonical conservation law. The main\nconclusion is: Rastall non-canonical scalar field requires a matter component (baryons, for example) in order for the theory to make sense at the\nperturbative level.\nIn the next section, we introduce the Rastall non-canonical scalar field.\nIn section 3, we discuss the sound speed issue in this theory, and in section\n4 we investigate the evolution of the gravitational potential and find the\nconstraint \u03b3 = 1. In section 5, we show how to soothe such constraint, by\nadding a canonical fluid component, and we study the gravitational potential\nin a special case. In section 6, we present our conclusions.\n3\n\n\f2. Scalar field in Rastall's theory\nIn Rastall's theory [10] a scalar field \u03c6 is characterised by the following\nstress-energy tensor:\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6,\u03bd \u2212\n\n2\u2212\u03b3\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 + g\u03bc\u03bd (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V (\u03c6) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a parameter. When \u03b3 = 1, we recover the corresponding theory\nin General Relativity.\nWe consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker metric\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)\u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n(2)\nand its perturbation written in the newtonian gauge\nds2 = [1 + 2\u03a6(t, xi )]dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)[1 \u2212 2\u03a6(t, xi )]\u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a6(t, xi ) is the gravitational potential.\nConsider a scalar field perturbation of the form \u03c6(t, xi ) = \u03c60 (t) + \u03b4\u03c6(t, xi )\nand derive from Eq. (1) together with Eqs. (2) and (3) the background and\nfirst-order perturbed mixed-component stress-energy tensors. The former is\n\u03b3 2\n(0) 0\n(4)\nT 0 = \u03c1 = \u03c6 \u03070 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V (\u03c60 ) ,\n2\n(0) 0\nT i = 0,\n(5)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\u2212\u03b3  \u0307 2\n(0) i\nT j = \u2212p\u03b4 i j = \u2212\n\u03c60 \u2212 (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V (\u03c60 ) \u03b4 i j ,\n(6)\n2\nwhere the dot denotes derivative with respect to t and \u03c1 and p are the scalar\nfield energy density and pressure, respectively. The perturbative quantities\nhave the form\n \u0307 \u2212 \u03b3\u03a6\u03c6 \u03070 2 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n(7)\n\u03b4T 0 0 = \u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b3 \u03c6 \u03070 \u03b4\u03c6\n0\n\u03b4T i = \u03c6 \u03070 \u03b4\u03c6,i ,\n(8)\nh\ni\n \u0307 + (2 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03a6\u03c6 \u03070 2 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 \u03b4 i j , (9)\n\u03b4T i j = \u2212\u03b4p\u03b4 i j = (\u03b3 \u2212 2)\u03c6 \u03070 \u03b4\u03c6\n\nwhere , i denotes the spatial derivative with respect to the coordinate xi and\nV,\u03c6 := dV (\u03c6)/d\u03c6. The modified Klein-Gordon equation has the covariant\nform\n\u03c6,\u03c1\u03c6,\u03c3 \u03c6;\u03c1;\u03c3\n\u0003\u03c6 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n,\n(10)\n\u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1\n4\n\n\fwhere \u0003\u03c6 := \u03c6;\u03b1 ;\u03b1 . From Eq. (10), it appears clearer that \u03b3 = 1 restores the\nGeneral Relativity case. Insert again \u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u03b4\u03c6 into Eq. (10) and employ\nmetric (2) and (3), in order to find\n\u03b3 \u03c6 \u03080 + 3H \u03c6 \u03070 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere H := \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter. Employing the conformal time\nd\u03b7 = dt/a(t) we write\n\u03b3\u03c6\u2032\u20320 + (3 \u2212 \u03b3)H\u03c6\u20320 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)a2 V,\u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the prime denotes derivation with respect to the conformal time and\nH := a\u2032 /a. The perturbed modified Klein-Gordon equation has the following\nform:\n\u03b3\u03b4\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + (3 \u2212 \u03b3)H\u03b4\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u22072 \u03b4\u03c6\n\u2212(3 + \u03b3)\u03c6\u20320 \u03a6\u2032 + 2(3 \u2212 2\u03b3)a2 V,\u03c6 \u03a6 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)a2 V,\u03c6\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere V,\u03c6\u03c6 := d2 V (\u03c6)/d\u03c62.\nDifferently from the \u03b3 = 1 case, in Rastall's theory we have more degrees\nof freedom. Indeed, considering T \u03bc \u03bd;\u03bc = 0 :\n\u03c6,\u03bd [\u0003\u03c6 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3) V,\u03c6 ] = (1 \u2212 \u03b3) \u03c6,\u03bc \u03c6;\u03bc;\u03bd ,\n\n(14)\n\none notices that the contraction with \u03c6,\u03bd gives the Klein-Gordon equation,\nEq. (10). However, Eq. (14) are actually four independent equations. Only\nin the \u03b3 = 1 case they reduce to only one, namely the usual Klein-Gordon\nequation. Using Eq. (10) into Eq. (14) one obtains\n\u03c6,\u03bd \u03c6;\u03b1;\u03b2 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6;\u03bd;\u03b2 \u03c6,\u03b2 = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nAt the background level, being \u03c60 dependent only on the time, Eq. (15) is\nidentically satisfied. For small perturbations, Eq. (15) gives the perturbed\nKlein-Gordon equation for \u03bd = 0, whereas for \u03bd = i one has\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u03080 \u03b4\u03c6,i = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u03070 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307,i \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u030720 \u03a6,i .\nFor \u03b3 6= 1 one can cast the above equation as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013*\n\u03b4\u03c6,i\n= \u03a6,i ,\n\u03c6\u03070\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nwhich appears to be an additional constraint that we have to take into account together with the Einstein's equations.\n5\n\n\f3. The scalar field speed of sound in Rastall's theory\nIn [12] the authors investigate the case corresponding to \u03b3 = 2, which is\nable to reproduce the \u039bCDM scenario both at the background and at the\nperturbative level. A possible explanation for the success of the case \u03b3 = 2\nmay reside in the fact that in such instance the speed of sound vanishes, as\nwe show now. The speed of sound is defined as the ratio c2s := \u03b4p/\u03b4\u03c1, which\nis gauge-dependent. Therefore, it makes sense to consider its value in the\nreference frame where the substance whose collapse is being investigated is\nat rest; we denote such quantity as c\u02c6s .\nFollowing [13], we employ the formula\n\u03b4p = c\u02c6s 2 \u03b4\u03c1 + 3aH\u03c1(1 + w) c\u02c6s 2 \u2212 c2a\n\n\u0001 \u03b8\n,\nk2\n\n(18)\n\nwhich links the pressure perturbations to the energy density ones, both in a\ngeneric gauge, via c\u02c6s 2 . In this formula, c2a is the adiabatic speed of sound,\ndefined as c2a := \u1e57/\u03c1\u0307 and which, for the Rastall scalar field that we are\ninvestigating, has the form\nc2a =\n\n3H(2 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6 \u03070 + 2(3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6\n,\n3H\u03b3 \u03c6 \u03070\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we have employed Eqs. (4), (6) and the equation of motion (11). Moreover, in formula (18), w := p/\u03c1, k is the wavenumber coming from a normal\nmode decomposition and \u03b8 is defined via\na(\u03c1 + p)\u03b8 := \u2202 i \u03b4T 0 i = \u03c6 \u03070 \u2202 i \u03b4\u03c6,i .\n\n(20)\n\nSubstituting in Eq. (18) the expressions for \u03b4\u03c1 and \u03b4p, that we have found\nin Eqs. (7) and (9), and Eqs. (19) and (20) we obtain\nh\ni\n2\n2\n \u0307\n \u0307\n \u0307\n \u0307\n\u03b3 c\u02c6s \u03b3 \u03c60 \u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3\u03a6\u03c60 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 + 3H \u03c60\u03b4\u03c6 =\nh\ni\n \u0307 \u2212 \u03b3\u03a6\u03c6 \u03070 2 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 + 3H \u03c6 \u03070 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n= (2 \u2212 \u03b3) \u03b3 \u03c6 \u03070 \u03b4\u03c6\n(21)\n\nwhich clearly gives that c\u02c6s 2 = (2 \u2212 \u03b3)/\u03b3 and therefore the case \u03b3 = 2 implies\nc\u02c6s 2 = 0, which is a favouring case for the collapse.\n\n6\n\n\f4. Evolution of the gravitational potential\nFollowing [14], we calculate the Einstein tensor from metric (3) and combine it with the perturbed stress-energy tensor in Eqs. (7)\u2013(9). In particular, as we implicitly anticipated in writing the perturbed metric (3), since\n\u03b4T i j \u221d \u03b4 i j we have only one gravitational potential. See [14] for more detail.\nWe obtain\n\u0001\n\u22072 \u03a6 \u2212 3H (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) + \u03b3 H2 \u2212 H\u2032 \u03a6 =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n4\u03c0G \u03b3\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)a2 V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n(22)\nH\u03a6,i + \u03a6\u2032,i = 4\u03c0G\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6,i ,\n\n(23)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 3H\u03a6\u2032 + 2H\u2032 + H2 \u03a6 + (2 \u2212 \u03b3) H2 \u2212 H\u2032 \u03a6 =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n4\u03c0G (2 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)a2 V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n\n(24)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere we have also used the background relation 4\u03c0G\u03c602 = H2 \u2212 H\u2032 .\nNow we reduce the above system in two different ways which, however,\nwill give different results unless we choose \u03b3 = 1. Let us employ a normal\nmode decomposition. The second equation can thus be written as H\u03a6+ \u03a6\u2032 =\n4\u03c0G\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6 and \u22072 = \u2212k 2 .\nNow, if we sum or subtract the first equation with the third, use H\u03a6+\u03a6\u2032 =\n4\u03c0G\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6 in order to eliminate \u03b4\u03c6 and the equation of motion (12) in order\nto eliminate \u03c6\u2032\u20320 we obtain:\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 3H\u03a6\u2032 + 2H\u2032 + H2 \u03a6 =\n\u0003 2V,\u03c6 a2\n2\u2212\u03b3 \u0002 2\n(3 \u2212 2\u03b3) (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) ,\n(25)\n\u2212k \u03a6 \u2212 3H (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) \u2212\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03c6\u20320\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 3H\u03a6\u2032 + 2H\u2032 + H2 \u03a6 =\n2\u2212\u03b3\n2V,\u03c6 a2\n\u2212k 2 \u03a6 \u2212 3H\n(H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) \u2212\n(3 \u2212 2\u03b3) (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) .\n(26)\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03c6\u20320\nThese equations can be identical only if \u03b3 = 1, which is the General Relativity\nlimit of Rastall's theory.\nActually, these equations could be consistent also if k = 0, but what does\nthis mean? Going back to the Einstein equations, before the normal modes\n7\n\n\fdecomposition, k = 0 would mean \u22072 \u03a6 = 0, which implies that \u03a6 should be\na homogeneous field, i.e. \u03a6 = \u03a6(\u03b7). Note that any spatial linear dependence\nfor \u03a6 would be unacceptable since the field would diverge at infinity.\nBut if \u03a6 is homogeneous, then we are not facing real perturbations. In\nfact, it is sufficient in metric (3) to redefine the time and the scale factor as\nfollows:\ndt\u03042 = [1 + 2\u03a6(t)]dt2 ,\n\u01012 (t) = a2 (t)[1 \u2212 2\u03a6(t)] ,\n(27)\nand we obtain again the FLRW metric in the usual reference frame, with t\u0304\nthe cosmic time.\nTherefore we conclude that a consistent perturbation theory, formulated\nin the newtonian gauge, is possible only for \u03b3 = 1.\nIs such result compatible with the new constraint (17) that we have\nshowed to exist in Rastall's theory, for \u03b3 6= 1? The answer is yes, since\ncombining Eqs. (22) and (23) it is possible to obtain Eq. (17). Therefore,\nthe latter is not an actual constraint: it is already embedded in Einstein's\nequations.\n5. The role of a fluid component\nThe result found in the previous section appears to be different if we\nintroduce another component together with the Rastall scalar field. Indeed,\nlet us consider a perfect fluid with equation of state p = w\u03c1 and w constant.\nWe write its total (i.e. background plus perturbed) stress-energy tensor as\nfollows:\nT 0 0 = \u03c1(1 + \u03b4) ,\nT 0 i = \u2212\u03c1(1 + w)vi ,\nT i j = \u2212(p + \u03b4p)\u03b4 i j ,\n\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03b4 := \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 is the usual density contrast, \u03b4\u03c1 is the density perturbation, \u03b4p is the pressure one and vi is the velocity. We assume adiabatic\nperturbations, i.e. \u03b4p = c2s \u03b4\u03c1, where c2s = w.\nEmploying again the normal mode decomposition, we rewrite the system\n\n8\n\n\fof linearised Einstein equations as follows:\n\u0001\n\u2212 k 2 \u03a6 \u2212 3H (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) + \u03b3 H2 \u2212 H\u2032 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03c6 + 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4\u03c1 ,\n\n(31)\n\nk (H\u03a6 + \u03a6\u2032 ) = 4\u03c0Gk\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6 + 4\u03c0G\u03c1(1 + w)v ,\n\n(32)\n\n\u0001\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 3H\u03a6\u2032 + 3H2 \u03a6 \u2212 \u03b3 H2 \u2212 H\u2032 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4p\u03c6 + 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b4p ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere we have defined:\n\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c6 :=\n\n1 \u2032 \u2032\n\u03b3\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 + (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\na2 0\n\n(34)\n\n1\n(2 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c6\u20320 \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\n(35)\na2\nand v is the velocity potential defined by vi = \u2212v,i /k.\nWith the fluid variables and the relation \u03b4p = c2s \u03b4\u03c1 we have a total of four\nunknowns (\u03a6, \u03b4\u03c6, \u03b4\u03c1, v) but only 3 equations. Therefore, it is impossible to\nobtain again a constraint as strong as \u03b3 = 1.\nLet us investigate in some detail the coupled system fluid plus Rastall\nscalar field. Multiplying Eq. (31) by 2 \u2212 \u03b3, Eq. (33) by \u03b3 and subtracting\nthe two we obtain:\n\u0001\n\u03b3\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + 6H\u03a6\u2032 + 6H2 \u03a6 \u2212 2\u03b3 H2 \u2212 H\u2032 \u03a6 + (2 \u2212 \u03b3)k 2 \u03a6 =\n\u0001\n\u22128\u03c0Ga2 (3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V,\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6 + 4\u03c0Ga2 \u03b3c2s + \u03b3 \u2212 2 \u03b4\u03c1 .\n(36)\n\u03b4p\u03c6 :=\n\nFrom this equation we eliminate \u03b4\u03c6 with the help of Eq.

We now assume the fluid to satisfy its own\nenergy-momentum conservation, separately from the scalar field, in order to\ngain one more equation necessary to solve the system. From T \u03bc \u03bd;\u03bc = 0, for\nthe fluid component only, we get:\n\u03b4 \u2032 = \u2212(1 + w)(kv \u2212 3\u03a6\u2032 ) ,\nkc2s\n\u03b4 + k\u03a6 .\nv \u2032 = \u2212H(1 \u2212 3w)v +\n1+w\n9\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\n\fNow we have to specify the background evolution, i.e. the function H.

(37), we assume that the potential is a\nconstant, i.e. V \u2032 = 0. Therefore, it is going to play the role of an effective\ncosmological constant. If the potential is a constant, it turns out from the\nKlein-Gordon equation (11) that\n\u03c6\u20320 = u0 a\u2212(3\u2212\u03b3)/\u03b3 ,\n\n(41)\n\nand the Friedmann equation takes on the following form:\nH2\n= \u03a90 a\u22123(1+w) + \u03a9V + \u03a9u0 a\u22126/\u03b3 ,\nH02 a2\n\n(42)\n\nwith the definitions\n\u03a9V :=\n\n8\u03c0G(3 \u2212 2\u03b3)V\n,\n3H02\n\n\u03a9u0 :=\n\n8\u03c0G\u03b3u20\n.\n3H02\n\n(43)\n\nFinally, trading the conformal time for the scale factor, we write the coupled\nsystem of Einstein equations plus the fluid equations as\n\"\n#\n\"\n#\n\u1e22 6 + \u03b3\nk2\n2\u03b3 \u1e22 6 \u2212 2\u03b3\n\u03b3\u03a6aa + \u03b3 +\n\u03a6a +\n+\n\u03a6 + (2 \u2212 \u03b3) 2 2 \u03a6 =\nH\na\nHa\na2\nH a\n\u0001\n3H02\n\u22123(1+w)\n2\n\u03a9\na\n\u03b3c\n+\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n2\n\u03b4 , (44)\n0\ns\n2H2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nkv\n\u2212 3\u03a6a , (45)\n\u03b4a = \u2212(1 + w)\nHa\n1\nkc2s\nk\nva = \u2212 (1 \u2212 3w)v +\n\u03b4+\n\u03a6 , (46)\na\n(1 + w)Ha\nHa\nwhere the subscript a denotes derivation with respect to the scale factor.\nWe start the evolution from ai = 10\u22123 and choose as initial conditions\n\u2032\n\u03a6i = vi = 0, \u03a6i = \u2212\u03b4i = \u22121.\nWith the choice w = 0 and \u03b3 = 2, Eqs.

In Figure 1 and 2\nwe plot the evolution of \u03a6 and \u03b4 for the choice w = 0 and \u03a90 = 0.04. That\nis, we are assuming that the perfect fluid under consideration is a baryon\ncomponent. We have also chosen a scale k = 10\u22123 h Mpc\u22121 . It seems that,\nfor \u03b3 > 2, the growth of the density contrast of the fluid component is\nenhanced. This is probably due to the fact that \u01092s becomes negative and\ntherefore the collapse of the scalar field is unimpeded. For \u03b3 < 2 the growth\nof \u03b4 is sensibly hampered. It is curious in Figure 2 how the gravitational\npotential suffers a larger decrease for the case \u03b3 = 1.5 than for the \u03b3 = 1\none. We would have expect the contrary, since for \u03b3 = 1 the speed of sound\nis \u01092s = 1, whereas for \u03b3 = 3/2 the speed of sound is \u01092s = 1/3, i.e. smaller.\nNote that such discrepancy is not present in the plots for \u03b4, i.e. the growth\nfor \u03b3 = 1.5 is larger than the one for \u03b3 = 1. Therefore, such effect is probably\ndue to the different background evolution.\nFor completeness, we display here also the evolution of \u03b4\u03c6 := \u03b4\u03c1\u03c6 /\u03c1\u03c6 ,\nwhich can be easily calculated from Eq.

(17) are in order, since the latter establishes a\n12\n\n\fstrong connection between perturbations in the scalar field and in the gravitational potential. For a single scalar field component, Rastall's theory reduces\nto General Relativity, thus everything runs as in the standard lore. On the\nother hand, the coupling with matter brings new features. Here also comes\nthe complexity given by the new conservation law of Rastall's theory, which\nadmits many consistent alternatives. If the matter component conserves separately (as we have investigated in this paper), Eq. (17) remains untouched.\nHowever, there are examples in which it may change, e.g. the case in which\nmatter exchanges energy with the scalar field or the one investigated in [15],\nwhere two fluid components were considered, one of them still conserving\nseparately, whereas the conservation of other depending on the curvature. In\nthis case, it is not difficult to show that relation (17) gives place to\n\u0012\n\u0013*\n\u03b4\u03c6,i\n1\n= \u03a6,i \u2212 (\u03b4\u03c1,i \u2212 3\u03b4p,i ) ,\n(47)\n2\n\u03c6\u03070\nrendering the situation somewhat different. In [15] other possible couplings\nbetween the two components are also evoked, which may lead to other variants for Eq. (17).\nEven if our interest in this work is the late-times universe, we may ask for\npotential consequences of Eq. (17) and its possible variants for the primordial\nspectrum. One point is that Rastall's scalar model requires another component in order to make sense. But, an adiabatic primordial spectrum can be\nnaturally implemented mainly if the matter component is subdominant with\nrespect to the scalar component. The isocurvature component can also be\nimplemented, in principle, since it requires a zero total (scalar plus matter)\ndensity fluctuation \u03b4\u03c1tot = 0, and this even if the relation (17) still holds, as\nin the case where the other component conserves separately, without direct\ninteraction with the scalar field. When other types of interactions between\nboth components are considered, as in the equation above, the isocurvature\nperturbation can still exist. But, in general, the detailed predictions for the\nspectrum must differ from the standard cases, mainly in the isocurvature\ncase. This may open a new path of investigation concerning the specific\npredictions of Rastall's theory for the primordial spectrum of perturbations.\nEquation (17) also reminds the relation between the spatial curvature and\nthe inflaton field, in the standard inflationary scenario [16]. However, such\nconnection still has to be investigated in detail, in order to understand how\ninflation could be implemented into Rastall's theory.\n13\n\n\f6. Conclusions\nThe scalar formulation of Rastall's theory of gravity may allow a consistent unification of dark matter and dark energy for the background evolution\nof the universe. We have shown in this paper that, on the other hand, its\nsingle component version (with the non-canonical Rastall scalar field as the\nonly matter content) is perturbatively inconsistent: the compatibility of the\nperturbed equations requires a homogeneous gravitational potential, which\nis equivalent to a redefinition of the background functions and not to real\nperturbations. The Rastall scalar theory may admit consistent perturbative\nscenario if another (canonical) fluid component is added.\nFor a two-fluid model, we numerically evaluate the behaviour of the gravitational potential and that of the density contrast for the scalar field component. For some cases, as \u03b3 \u223c 1.5, a behaviour very similar to that obtained in the General Relativity case with a quintessence field is obtained.\nAlthough this does not represent an exhaustive study of the Rastall twocomponent model, the results here reported indicate that consistent scenarios may emerge from a Rastall unification model for dark energy. We hope to\npresent in future a more exhaustive study with a detailed comparison with\ncosmological observational data.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank CNPq (Brazil) for partial financial support.
