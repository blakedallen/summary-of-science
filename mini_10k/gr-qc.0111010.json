We present a generalization in which the LTB metric is kept but the source is replaced by an imperfect fluid with anisotropic\npressure, under the assumption that matter-energy density is decomposed\nas \u03c1 = \u03c1(m) + \u03c1(r) , a mixture of \"rest mass\" and \"radiation\" components\n(a mixture of non-relativistic and relativistic matter), so that \u03c1(r) = 3p,\nwhere p is the isotropic pressure. The purpose of this paper is to derive\nthe important geometric properties of the solutions within a convenient\nframework and then to examine the compatibility of the models with the\nphysics of radiation-matter sources.\nThe study of inhomogeneous cosmological models such the LTB models\nis a well motivated and justified endeavor. First of all, it complements\nthe usual perturbative approach by allowing one to study the non-linear\nevolution of inhomogeneities. Also, a nearly isotropic Cosmic Microwave\nBackground Radiation (CMB) does not rule out an inhomogeneous universe\ncompatible with current CMB observations [4],[5]. Moreover, the models\nwe examine here are of particular interest when it is necessary to consider\nthe radiation component and the dissipative processes associated with its\ninteraction with non-relativistic matter [6], [7], [8]. On the other hand,\neven if it is reasonable to use a dust source model as a theoretical matter\nmodel for present day universe, this source cannot describe the CMB and\ndoes not allow one to deal with temperatures of the photon gas.\nVarious physical interpretations and observational bounds have been proposed for anisotropic stresses in cosmic matter sources[10],[11]. If the mixture components are not interacting, then we have a mixture of collision-less\nnon-relativistic matter and CMB with anisotropic pressure understood as\nthe quadrupole moment of the distribution function for the photon gas[12]\n- [18] under a Kinetic Theory approach[19],[20]. For a matter-radiation\nmixture in which there is interaction between the components (a radiative\nphoton-electron interaction), the anisotropic pressure can be interpreted\n\n\f2\nas shear viscosity within a causal irreversible thermodynamic approach [9],\n[21] -[22]. This provides an adequate model for the radiative era of cosmic\nevolution, from after nucleosynthesis to up to \"matter\" and \"radiation\"\ndecoupling.\nIn section II, Einstein's field equations are integrated up to a Friedmannlike equation, a quadrature in which the free parameters are three initial\n(r)\n(m)\nvalue functions related to the average of initial energy densities \u03c1i , \u03c1i\nand (3) R, the 3-dimensional Ricci scalar along the initial surface t = ti . In\nsection III, we describe the possible physical interpretations of the models\nsource focusing on the interacting matter-radiation mixture. In sections IV\nand V we express the free parameters in terms of suitable volume averages\nand initial contrast functions defined along t = ti , leading to simplified\nand elegant forms for all the relevant geometric and physical quantities.\nThese quantities become fully determined (up to initial conditions) once\nthe Friedmann-like quadrature is integrated (appendix A) yielding canonical and parametric solutions. The models contain three important particular cases presented in appendix B. In sections VI and VII, we examine the\nstate variables of the model under small density contrasts. Theses small\ncontrasts lead to two important classes of initial conditions equivalent to\nthe definition of adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic perturbations of the initial\ndensities and the initial curvature. In section VIII, we study the thermodynamic consistency of the coupled mixture model.\nDifferent variants of the imperfect fluid generalization of LTB solutions\nhave been presented previously: using the equation of state of a nonrelativistic ideal gas [14], considering various possible ideal gas equations\nof state and a generalization to non-spherical geometry of the SzekeresSzafron type [15] and the parabolic case for the matter-radiation mixture\n[16]. The present paper extend and complement the results of previous\nliterature with respect to the specific cases of spherically symmetric and\ncurved (elliptic and hyperbolic) models with a radiation-matter mixture\nsource.\nII.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS.\n\nConsider the usual LTB metric\nds2 = \u2212c2 dt2 +\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nY \u20322\ndr2 + Y 2 d\u03b82 + sin2 (\u03b8)d\u03c62 ,\n1\u2212K\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Y = Y (t, r), K = K(r) and a prime denotes derivative with respect\nto r.

In order to integrate these equations we need\nto impose a relation between \u03c1 and p but no previous assumption on P is\nnecessary.\nConsider \u03c1 in (2) to be the sum of two contributions: non-relativistic\nmatter described by dust plus radiation energy density (\u03c1(r) )\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(m) + \u03c1(r) ,\n\np =\n\n1 (r)\n\u03c1 ,\n3\n\nwith:\n\n2M \u2032\n8\u03c0G (m)\n\u03c1\n=\n,\nc4\nY 2Y \u2032\n\n(6)\n\nwhere M = M (r), while the form of \u03c1(r) will be discussed further ahead.\nInserting (6) into (3) and (4) and integrating once with respect to t leads\nto the Friedmann equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\nYi\n1\n2M + W\n\u2212 K,\n(7)\n\u1e8e 2 =\nY\nY\nwhere W = W (r) and Yi = Y (ti , r) for an arbitrary fixed value t = ti .

Therefore, a suitable physical\ninterpretation for this source is an interactive, 'tightly coupled' mixture of\nmatter and radiation examined under a hydrodynamical approach. The\nanisotropic pressure becomes a dissipative term (a shear viscosity) that\nmust be examined within a thermodynamic framework[21] -[22], [23],[24].\nThis type of source provides a convenient description for the \"radiative\nera\", after nucleosynthesis and before decoupling of radiation and matter.\nAn alternative approach is that of a decoupled mixture (non-relativistic\nmatter plus the CMB) under the framework of Kinetic Theory [12] - [20]. In\nthis paper we shall consider only the hydrodynamical approach applicable\nto the radiative era, leaving the study of a decoupled mixture for a future\nwork.\nThe 'tightly coupled' mixture of non-relativistic matter and radiation (a\nphoton gas) is characterized by local thermal equilibrium (common temperature) among the components. This situation implies that interaction\ntimescales are smaller than the cosmic expansion timescale, thus a hydrodynamical approach is valid so that this interactive mixture behaves as a\nsingle dissipative fluid. Since heat flux necessarily vanishes for the LTB\nmetric (1), this fluid can be described by the momentum-energy tensor\n(2) where \u03a0ab now becomes the shear viscous tensor. Considering that\nnon-relativistic matter can be modeled by a classical monatomic ideal gas,\nwhile the photon gas satisfies the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the tightly coupled mixture of these components requires that \u03c1 and p in (2) must comply\nwith the equation of state\n\u03c1 = m c2 n +\n\n3\nn k T + a T 4,\n2\n\np = nkT +\n\n1\na T 4,\n3\n\n(12)\n\nwhere k, a are Boltzmann and Stephan-Boltzmann constants, T is the common mixture temperature, m is the mass of the most representative species\nof non-relativistic particles and n is particle number density, satisfying (we\nassume there is no net creation or annihilation of particles) the conservation\nlaw\n(n ua );a = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nn =\n\nN (r)\n,\nY 2Y \u2032\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N (r) is an arbitrary function. If nkT \u226a aT 4 , or equivalently\naT 3 /nk \u226b 1, but mc2 n/aT 4 is not negligible, then (12) can be approximated by[9],[21]\n\u03c1 = m c2 n + a T 4 ,\n\np =\n\n1\na T 4,\n3\n\n(14)\n\nComparing the conservation law (13) and the equation of state (14) with\n(6a) and (6b), it is evident that the generalized LTB solutions can provide\na model for the radiation-matter tightly coupled mixture if we identify\n\u03c1(m) = m c2 n,\n\nm c2 N = 2 M \u2032 =\n\n8\u03c0G (m) 2 \u2032\nYi Yi ,\n\u03c1\nc4 i\n\n(m)\n\n\u03c1i\n\n= m c2 n i ,\n\n(15)\nso that the radiation energy density and the temperature are given by\n[W Yi /Y ]\nY 2Y \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n8\u03c0G (r)\n8\u03c0G\n\u03c1\n=\na T 4,\nc4\nc4\n\n8\u03c0G\na Ti4 = W \u2032 Yi2 Yi\u2032 .\nc4\n\n(16)\n\n\f5\nAs an alternative to (12) and (14), it is possible to consider, instead of the\nStefan-Boltzmann law, \u03c1(r) = aT 4 , the energy density and pressure of the\nradiation component as those of an ideal ultra-relativistic gas\np(r) = n(r) k T,\n\n\u03c1(r) = 3p(r) ,\n\nn(r) =\n\nN (r)\nY 2Y \u2032\n\n(17)\n\nwhere n(r) is the corresponding particle number density, independently\nsatisfying a conservation law like (13) with N (r) = N (r) (r). This approach\nhas been followed previously in [15] and [16], the advantage being a simpler\nexpression than (16) for the temperature in terms of the gradients of Y\n1\n8\u03c0G\np Y 2Y \u2032 =\nc4\n3\n\n\u0014\n\nW\n\nYi\nY\n\n\u0015\u2032\n\n= N (r) k T,\n\n(18)\n\nIn global thermal equilibrium, the fact that photon entropy per barion\nis conserved: s(e) = (4/3) a T 3/n = const. implies that the ratio of photons to baryons is constant and a T 4 \u221d n k T , hence the Stefan-Boltzmann\nand ideal gas laws are equivalent. Since we shall consider near equilibrium conditions in which these two laws should be almost (but not exactly)\nequivalent, then a T 3 /(n k) is proportional to the (approximately constant)\nnumber of photons per non-relativistic particle. If the latter are baryons\nand electrons, then this quantity is very large, thus justifying the approximation leading from (12) to (14). If temperatures are high enough so that\nthe ratio aT 4 /(mc2 n) is low enough for creation/annihilation processes\nto cancel each other (hence (13) holds), then (14) provides a reasonable\ndescription of cosmic matter in the radiative era. The dominant radiative processes characteristic of this era mostly involve the photon-electron\ninteraction (Thomson and Compton scattering, Brehmstrallung, etc) [6],\n[21] and [22]. The temperature range for the radiative era (up to matterradiation decoupling) is roughly 4 \u00d7 103 K. < T < 106 K. The anisotropic\npressure \u03a0a b is now the shear viscosity tensor, hence its evolution law must\nbe consistent with the shear viscosity transport equation of a causal irreversible thermodynamic theory. In the particular case when shear viscosity\nis the single dissipative flux, the entropy per particle and shear viscosity\ntransport equation provided by Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics are\ns = s(e) +\n\n\u03b1\n\u03a0ab \u03a0ab ,\nnT\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03a0\u0307cd hca hdb\n\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4\n\n+ \u03a0ab\n\n1\n1 + T\u03b7\n2\n\n(snua );a = \u1e61nua \u2265 0,\n\u03c4 c\nu\nT\u03b7\n\n\u0013 #\n\n+ 2 \u03b7 \u03c3ab = 0,\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\n;c\n\nwhere s(e) = (4/3)aT 3/n is the equilibrium entropy per particle, taken (approximately) as the initial photon entropy per non-relativistic particle, \u03b7, \u03c4\nare the coefficient of shear viscosity and a relaxation time which, together\nwith \u03b1, are phenomenological coefficients whose functional form depends\non the fluid under consideration. A \"truncated\" version of (20), also known\nas the \"Maxwell-Cattaneo\" transport equation, is often used[22], [23] for\nthe sake of mathematical simplicity:\n\u03c4 \u03a0\u0307cd hca hdb + \u03a0ab + 2 \u03b7 \u03c3ab = 0,\n\n(21)\n\nAlthough this truncated equation satisfies causality and stability requirements, numerical and theoretical studies indicate that it might be\nproblematic[25]. In spite of the obvious limitation of having only one dissipative flux, the generalized LTB models provide arguments to infer the\nranges of applicability of the truncated and full equations.\n\n\f6\nThe application of the thermodynamic formalism to the generalized LTB\nmodels, considered as a models of a hydrodynamical 'tightly coupled' mixture of matter and radiation, requires a convenient selection of the phenomenological quantities \u03b7, \u03b1, \u03c4 , and then solving the appropriate transport equation (either (20) or (21)). In order to proceed with this task we\nwill find in the following sections an intuitive characterization of initial\nconditions and suitable forms for the state variables.\nIV.\n\nINITIAL CONDITIONS AND VOLUME AVERAGES\n\nIt is convenient to transform the Friedmann equation (7) into the simpler\nquadrature\n\u1e8f 2 =\n\n\u2212\u03ba y 2 + 2\u03bc y + \u03c9\n,\ny2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\ny =\n\nY\n,\nYi\n\nM\n,\nYi3\n\n\u03bc \u2261\n\n\u03c9 \u2261\n\nW\n,\nYi3\n\n\u03ba \u2261\n\nK\n,\nYi2\n\nYi = Y (ti , r)\n\nBearing in mind (9), assuming that the initial hypersurface t = ti is everywhere regular and contains at least a symmetry center [16] [15], we\ncan express the quantities \u03bc, \u03c9, \u03ba as the following type of volume averages\nalong t = ti\n(m)\nh\u03c1i i\n\n\u2261\n\n(r)\nh\u03c1i i\n\n(3)\n\nh\nwhere\n\nR\n\u2261\n\nRi i \u2261\n\n(m)\n\n\u03c1i\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nYi2 Yi\u2032 dr\nYi2 Yi\u2032 dr\n\n\u21d2\n\n2\u03bc =\n\n(r)\n\n\u03c1 Y 2 Y \u2032 dr\nRi 2 i \u2032 i\nYi Yi dr\n\n(3)\n\nR\n\nRi Yi2 Yi\u2032 dr\nYi2 Yi\u2032 dr\n\n(3)\n\nRi =\n\n8\u03c0G (m)\nh\u03c1 i,\n3c4 i\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03c9 =\n\n8\u03c0G (r)\nh\u03c1 i,\n3c4 i\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03ba =\n\n1 (3)\nh Ri i, ,\n6\n\n(23)\n\n2(K Yi )\u2032\n,\nYi2 Yi\u2032\n\nis the Ricci scalar of (1) evaluated at t = ti and the range of integration goes\nfrom the symmetry center up to a comoving sphere marked by r. Notice\nthat these averages (save for K = 0) do not\n\u221a proper\n\u221a coincide with the local\nvolume defined by (1), namely: Yi2 Yi\u2032 / 1 \u2212 K = (1/3)d(Yi3 )/ 1 \u2212 K,\nthough they can also be characterized covariantly, since the metric function Y (and so Yi ) is, in spherical symmetry, the \"curvature radius\", or the\nproper radius of the orbits of the rotation group SO(3). The volume averages (23) lead to a compact and elegant mathematical description of initial\nconditions. From the volume averages in (23) we can define the functions\n(k)\n(r)\n(m)\n\u2206i , \u2206i , \u2206i satisfying the following appealing relations\ni\nh\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\n,\n\u03c1i = h\u03c1i i 1 + \u2206i\ni\nh\n(r)\n(r)\n(r)\n\u03c1i = h\u03c1i i 1 + \u2206i ,\ni\nh\n(k)\n(3)\n(24)\nRi = h(3) Ri i 1 + \u2206i ,\n\n\f7\njustifying their interpretation as initial density and curvature \"contrast\nfunctions\", as they provide a measure of the contrast of initial value func(r)\n(m)\ntions \u03c1i , \u03c1i , (3) Ri with respect to their volume averages along the initial\nhypersurface t = ti . Because of their definition in terms of the volume averages (23), the value of the contrast functions at a given r = r\u2217 depend on the\n(r)\n(m)\nvalues of the functions \u03c1i , \u03c1i , (3) Ri on the integration range 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r\u2217 ,\nin which we assume that r = 0 marks a symmetry center characterized by\n(m)\nY (t, 0) = \u1e8e (t, 0) = 0 [16] [15]. Therefore, for a rest mass density lump \u03c1i\ndecreases with increasing r, while for a rest mass density void it increases\n(m)\nwith increasing r, hence (from (24)) we have \u22121 \u2264 \u2206i \u2264 0 for a lump\n(m)\nand \u2206i \u2265 0 for a void. The same criterion holds for the initial radiation\n(r)\ndensity and scalar curvature, \u03c1i and (3) Ri .\nFrom (23) and (24), it is straightforward to verify that the functions\n(k)\n(r)\n(m)\n(m) (r)\n\u03c1i , \u03c1i ,(3) Ri relate to \u2206i , \u2206i , \u2206i by\n(r)\n\n\u01eb1 =\n\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\n\u03c9\n2\u03c1i 1 + \u2206i\n= (m)\n,\n(r)\n\u03bc\n\u03c1i\n1 + \u2206i\n\nc4 (3) Ri 1 + \u2206i\n\u03ba\n=\n,\n(m)\n(k)\n\u03bc\n8\u03c0G \u03c1i\n1 + \u2206i\n\n\u01eb2 =\n\n(25)\n\nand\n(r)\n\n=\n\n\u2206i\n\n\u03c9 \u2032 /\u03c9\n,\nYi\u2032 /Yi\n\n(m)\n\n\u2206i\n\n\u03bc\u2032 /\u03bc\n,\nYi\u2032 /Yi\n\n=\n\n(k)\n\n\u2206i\n\n=\n\n\u03ba\u2032 /\u03ba\n.\nYi\u2032 /Yi\n\n(26)\n\nSince the state variables \u03c1(m) , \u03c1(r) , P and kinematic parameters \u0398, \u03c3 are\ngiven in terms of quantities that will depend on the initial value functions\n\u03bc, \u03c9, \u03ba and their gradients, it is useful to be able to express these gradients,\nby means of (25) and (26), in terms of the more intuitively appealing initial\ncontrast functions defined by (24).

Since the equilibrium limit of the models\n(excluding the dust limit which has trivial thermodynamics) is the FLRW\nlimit that follows by setting the initial contrast functions to zero, then a\n\"near equilibrium\" evolution can be related to a \"near FLRW\" evolution\nthat follows by assuming \"near homogeneous initial conditions\", or in other\nwords, small initial contrast functions, ie:\n(m)\n\n|\u2206i\n\n(r)\n\n|\u2206i | \u226a 1,\n\n| \u226a 1,\n\n(k)\n\n|\u2206i | \u226a 1,\n\n(39)\n\nimplying\n(m)\n\n\u03c1i\n\n(m)\n\n\u2248 h\u03c1i\n\n2\u03bc \u2248\n\n(r)\n\ni,\n\n\u03c1i\n\n8\u03c0G (m)\n\u03c1 ,\n3c4 i\n\n(r)\n\n\u01eb1 \u2248\n\n2\u03c1i\n\n(m)\n\u03c1i\n\n,\n\n\u01eb2 \u2248\n\n(r)\n\n\u2248 h\u03c1i i,\n\n(3)\n\nRi \u2248 h(3) Ri i,\n\n8\u03c0G (r)\n\u03c1 ,\n3c4 i\n\n\u03c9 \u2248\n\nc4 (3) Ri\n,\n8\u03c0G \u03c1(m)\ni\n\n\u03ba \u2248\n\n1 (3)\nRi ,\n6\n\n(\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 \u2248 const.),\n\n(40)\n\nwhere the exact form of \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 is given by (25). Under these assumptions,\nall functions depending on (\u03bc, \u03c9, \u03ba, y) become approximately functions of\ny only. From (32), (33), (34), (35) and (36), this implies\nZ \u2248 Z(y), t \u2212 ti \u2248 Z(y) \u2212 Zi , A \u2248 A(y), B \u2248 B(y), C \u2248 C(y),\n\n(41)\n\nwith Zi \u2248 const., so that hypersurfaces y = const. approximate hypersurfaces t = const. and y becomes the time parameter. The radial dependence in quantities like \u0393, \u03a8, \u03a6 is then contained in the initial contrast\nfunctions. Regarding the state variables, a Taylor series expansion around\n(k)\n(r)\n(m)\n\u2206i , \u2206i , \u2206i yields at first order\n1\n\u2248 1 + \u03b4,\n\u0393\n\n\u03a8\n4\n\u2248 1 + \u03b4,\n\u0393\n3\n\n4\n\u03a6\n(r)\n\u2248 \u2206i + \u03b4,\n\u0393\n3\n\n(42)\n\nwhere we can formally identify the \"perturbation\" as\n(m)\n\n\u03b4 \u2261 3 [A \u2206i\n\n(r)\n\n+ B \u2206i\n\n(k)\n\n+ C \u2206i ] = 1 \u2212 \u0393,\n\n(43)\n\nso that, from (27) and (42), we have\n\u0015\n\u0015\n(r) \u0014\n(r) \u0014\n(m)\n4\n4\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n(r)\n\u03c1(m) \u2248 i 3 [ 1 + \u03b4 ] , \u03c1(r) \u2248 i 4 1 + \u03b4 , P \u2248 i 4 \u2206i + \u03b4 ,\ny\ny\n3\n6y\n3\n(44)\nTherefore, under the \"small contrast approximation\" given by (39), (40)\nand (41) the models follow a nearly homogeneous evolution with respect\nto a scale factor y \u2248 y(t), deviating from homogeneity in a way (as given\nby equations (44)) that is formally analogous to that of adiabatic perturbations. This situation holds for whatever form of the contrast functions,\nas long as these adimensional quantities are very small (so that the initial\n(m) (r)\nfunctions \u03c1i , \u03c1i , (3) Ri are almost constant). Notice that, at first order\nexpansion on the contrast functions, we have for (29)\n\u0014\n\u0014 \u00151/4\n\u0015\n1\n1\nTi\n\u03a8\n1+ \u03b4 ,\n\u03a8 \u2248\n\u21d2\nT \u2248\n\u2248 1+ \u03b4\n(45)\n\u0393\n3\ny\n3\n\n\f10\nso that both, the Stefan-Boltzmann and Ideal Gas laws, yield the same\nexpression for T . Therefore, as long as we assume the small contrasts\napproximation, the Stefan-Boltzmann and Ideal Gas laws yield the same\nresult and we can use them indistinctly.\nThe resemblance of (44) to expressions characteristic of adiabatic perturbations is not surprising: the generalized LTB models under consideration\n(under a thermodynamic approach) have zero heat flux and so can be associated with thermodynamic processes that are indeed adiabatic, though\nirreversible (because of the shear viscosity). The connection between the\ncontrast functions and adiabatic perturbations on a radiation-matter 'tight\ncoupling' is an interesting feature that deserves proper examination and\nwill be studied in a separate paper. We will use this analogy as a theoretical tool for understanding the type of quasi-homogeneous evolution and\nfor defining suitable initial conditions for the study of the thermodynamic\nconsistency of the models.\nVII.\n\nADIABATIC AND QUASI-ADIABATIC INITIAL\nCONDITIONS.\n(s)\n\n(m)\n\n(r)\n\nAs shown in [16], the quantity \u2206i = \u2206i \u2212 (4/3)\u2206i becomes, under\nthe assumptions (39), (40) and (41), a sort of average change of photon\nentropy per barion at the initial hypersurface. Hence, it is convenient to\nrephrase initial conditions in terms of this quantity. After some algebraic\nmanipulation on the explicit general forms given in Appendix A for the\nfunctions A, B, C defined by (36), we find that the following restrictions on\nthe initial contrast functions\n4 (m)\n(s)\n(r)\n= \u2206i \u2212 \u2206i ,\n\u2206\n3 i\n\n(k)\n\n\u2206i\n\n=\n\n1 (r)\n\u2206 ,\n2 i\n\n(46)\n\nleads to the following compact forms for the function \u0393 defined in (33)\n\u0014\n\u221a \u0015\nq\n3\n(r)\n1 \u2212 2\u221a\n\u2206i +\n\u0393 = 1 +\n4\ny qi\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\n\u0001\nq\n3\n(s)\n2\n2\n2\n8\u01eb\n+\n4\u01eb\ny\n\u2212\ny\n\u2212\n\u2206i ,\n8\u01eb\n+\n4\u01eb\n\u2212\n1\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4y 2\nqi\nfor the parabolic case (\u01eb2 = 0),\n\u0014\n\u221a \u0015\nq\n3\n9\n(r)\n\u0393 = 1 +\n1 \u2212 2\u221a\n\u2206i +\n4\ny qi\n4\u01eb2 \u03bb0 y 2\n\" \u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a #\n\u221a \u0013\n\u221a \u0013\nq\nq\n\u03bb0 (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7i ) q\n(s)\np\n\u2212 (\u03bb0 \u00b1 1) y \u2212 \u221a\n\u00b1\n\u2206i ,\n\u01eb1 1 \u2212 2 \u221a\ny qi\nqi\n|\u01eb2 |\n\nelliptic (\u01eb2 > 0, + sign) and hyperbolic (\u01eb2 < 0, \u2212 sign) cases,(47)\n\nwhere \u01eb1 = \u03c9/\u03bc, \u01eb2 = \u03ba/\u03bc where defined in (25) and\nq = \u2212\u01eb2 y 2 + 2 y + \u01eb1 ,\n\u03bb0 = 1 \u00b1 \u01eb1 |\u01eb2 |,\n\u03b7 = arccos\n\n\u03b7 = arccosh\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 \u01eb2 y\n\u221a\n\u03bb0\n\n1 + |\u01eb2 | y\n\u221a\n\u03bb0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nelliptic (+ sign),\n\n\u03b7i = arccos\n\n, \u03b7i = arccosh\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nqi = \u2212\u01eb2 + 2 + \u01eb1 ,\nhyperbolic (\u2212 sign),\n\n1 \u2212 \u01eb2\n\u221a\n\u03bb0\n\n1 + |\u01eb2 |\n\u221a\n\u03bb0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nelliptic case,\n\n, hyperbolic case,\n\n\f11\nIt is evident, by looking at these forms for \u0393 above, that this function takes\na very simple form\n\u0014\n\u221a \u0015\nq\n3\n(r)\n1 \u2212 2\u221a\n\u0393 = 1 +\n(48)\n\u2206i ,\n4\ny qi\nvalid for all cases (parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic) if we use initial conditions given by\n(s)\n\n=0\n\n\u2206i\n\n(m)\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2206i\n\n=\n\n3 (r)\n\u2206 ,\n4 i\n\n(k)\n\n\u2206i\n\n=\n\n1 (r)\n\u2206 ,\n2 i\n\n(49)\n\nSince all state variables, kinematic parameters and auxiliary functions are\nconstructed from \u0393, y and initial value functions, the assumption (49)\nleads to very simplified forms for all expressions.

For the remaining of this paper\nwe will only consider initial conditions of either these two types, under the\n\"small contrast approximation\" given by (39), (40) and (41).\nVIII.\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC CONSISTENCY\n\nIn order for the models presented in this paper to be physically meaningful they must satisfy energy conditions and must be compatible with causal\nExtended Irreversible Thermodynamics. Before to start this analysis we\nneed first to provide an expression for the phenomenological quantities\n\u03b7, \u03b1, \u03c4 (coefficient of shear viscosity, relaxation time). Following the approach used in [16] and [26], we consider for a matter-radiation mixture\ninteracting via radiative processes, the \"radiative gas\" model, associated\nwith the photon-electron interaction, which provides the following forms\nfor \u03b7 and \u03b1 [21] -[22]\n\u03b7 =\n\n4\n4\np\u03c4 =\na T 4 \u03c4,\n5\n15\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n\u03c4\n15\n,\n= \u2212\n2\u03b7\n8aT4\n\n(50)\n\nInserting (50) into (19) and (20), the latter equations become\n\u1e61 =\n\n\u1e56 +\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n4\n\u0398+\n3\n\u03c4\n\n5 k \u03a0ab \u03a0ab\n15 k P 2\n=\n,\n8\u03c4\np2\n4 \u03c4 p2\n\u0013\n\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\nP\n8\n= 0,\nP + p \u03c3 1 + \u03bd0\n5\np\n\n(51)\n\n(52)\n\nwhere in (52) \u03bd0 = 5/4, 25/32, respectively, for the ideal gas and StefanBoltzmann laws (we examine the truncated equation (21) further ahead).\nThe transport equation (52) is an evolution equation for P imposed by\nthermodynamic theories external (even if coupled) to General Relativity.\nOn the other hand, there are evolution equations for P that follow from\nthe field equations, for example, by evaluating \u1e56 from (8) and eliminating\n\u1e8e /Y and \u1e8e \u2032 /Y \u2032 with the help of (10) and (11), leading to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\n\u1e56 + 5\u03c3 + \u0398 P \u2212 2 p \u03c3 = 0,\n(53)\n3\n\n\f12\nan exact equation that must be satisfied by the generalized LTB models.\nObviously, an equation like (53) does not exactly coincide with (52), and\nso compatibility between these models and Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics requires finding an appropriate expression for \u03c4 that should\nmake (53) consistent with the transport equation. Comparing (52) (with\n\u03bd0 = 5/4, ideal gas) with the evolution equation (53), we can see that both\nequations coincide if we identify\nh\nih\ni\n(r)\n(r)\n1 4 + 3\u2206i \u2212 4\u0393 4 + 3\u2206i \u2212 \u0393\n\u2212p P\n\b\n=\u2212\n\u03c4=\n,\nh\ni2\n2\n4\u03c3 4\n(r)\n\u03c3 2 P 2 + 18\n13\n171 2\n5 p \u22125pP\n+\n4\n+\n3\u2206\n\u0393\n\u0393\n+\ni\n5\n32\n256\n\n(54)\nThis expression is justified as long as it behaves as a relaxation parameter\nfor the interactive matter-radiation mixture in the theoretical framework\nof EIT as we will explain bellow.\nIt is also useful to compute the collision times for Thomson and Compton\nscattering (the dominant radiative processes in the radiative era)\n\nt\u03b3 =\n\n1\nc\u03c3T ne\n\n,\n\ntc =\n\nme c2\nt ,\nkB T \u03b3\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson scattering cross section, me is the electron mass\nand ne is the number density of free electrons, a quantity obtained from\nSaha's equation, leading to\n\uf8ee\n!1/2 \uf8f9\n3 (m)\nexp (B0 /kB T )\n1\n\uf8f01 + 1 + 4h n\n\uf8fb,\nt\u03b3 =\n(56)\n2c \u03c3T n(m)\n(2\u03c0 me kB T )3/2\nwhere B0 and h are respectively the hydrogen atom binding energy and\nPlanck's constant. For details of the derivation of (54) see [16].\nThe restrictions for physical acceptability and thermodynamic consistency were discussed in [26] and [16]. We provide a summary in the following list:\n\u2022 (i) Positive definiteness and monotonicity of \u03c1(r) and \u03c1(m) , and |P | \u226a\np.\n\u2022 (ii) Regularity condition\n\u0393 > 0,\n\n(57)\n\nwhich prevents the occurrence of a shell crossing singularity [17].\n\u2022 (iii) Positive definiteness of \u03c4 and \u1e61 (consistent with positive entropy\nproduction). The sign of \u1e61 (see (51)) depends only on the sign of \u03c4 .\n\u2022 (iv) Concavity and stability of s by requiring\nE\uf8ee\nE\uf8f9\nD\nD\n(r)\n(r)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\ni\ni\ns\u0308\n2\u03c3\u0393\n\uf8f01 +\n\uf8fb \u2212 \u03c4\u0307 < 0.\n\u03c4\u0307 > 0,\n=\n(r)\n\u1e61\n3\u03a8\u03a6 \u03c1(r)\n\u03c4\n3\u03c1\ni\n\n(58)\n\ni\n\n\u2022 (v) Appropriate behavior of the relaxation time \u03c4 .\n\nDuring the radiative era the Thompson time t\u03b3 must be smaller than\nthe expansion (or Hubble) time, approximately defined by tH = 3/\u0398.\nThe decoupling hypersurface is then defined by t\u03b3 = tH . From (iii)\nand (iv) above [15], [16], \u03c4 must be a positive and monotonously\n\n\f13\nincreasing function (if the fluid expands), then it must also be (during the interactive period) qualitatively similar but larger than the\nmicroscopic timescales of the various photon-electron interactions occurring in the radiative era. It is usually assumed that \u03c4 is of the\norder of magnitude of a collision time, and as matter and radiation\ndecouple all these timescales must overtake the Hubble expansion\ntime tH = 3/\u0398. A physically reasonable \u03c4 should be comparable in\nmagnitude to t\u03b3 near decoupling and must have an analogous qualitative behavior to t\u03b3 . Therefore \u03c4 must be smaller than tH during\nthe radiative era and then must overtake it at the decoupling hypersurface.\nIn the following list we test the previous restrictions (i) to (v) under\nthe assumption of the small contrasts approximation (39), (40) and (41),\ntogether with either adiabatic (49) or quasi-adiabatic (46) initial conditions:\n\u2022 (i) For a wide range of initial conditions all these quantities have a\nphysically meaningful behavior as indicated in Figure. 1.\n\u2022 (ii) Figure. 2 shows that \u0393 is positive and almost equal to unity for\nmost of the evolution range of y. For the small range defined by\n(S)\n10\u22125 \u2264 |\u2206i | \u2264 10\u22123 and log10 (y) \u2264 1 the plot of \u0393 is distinct for\nlumps and voids.\n\u2022 (iii) and (iv). Figure. 3 shows that \u03c4 > 0, \u1e61 > 0 are satisfied for\nquasi-adiabatic initial conditions. From Figure. 3 it can also be seen\nthat \u03c4 is a monotonically increasing function and so s\u0308 < 0. The same\nresults hold for adiabatic conditions (see Figure. 6a).\n(s)\n\n\u2022 (v) Under adiabatic initial conditions (|\u2206i | = 0), \u03c4 does not have\nthe required behavior described above (never overtakes tH ). This is\nshown in Figure. 6a. We find that the desired behavior of \u03c4 is encountered for quasi-adiabatic initial conditions. As shown in Figure. 4, this\nhappens in the elliptic case for the values 10\u22125.5 \u2264 |\u2206(s) | \u2264 10(\u22123) ,\ncompared to |\u2206(S) | \u2264 10(\u22128) in the hyperbolic (not shown) and\nparabolic case [26]. Finally, we plot the ratios \u03c4 /tH , tc /tH and t\u03b3 /tH\nin Figure. 5 showing that these times have a physically reasonable\nand consistent behavior.\nFurthermore, we examine the truncated transport equation for the generalized LTB models that follows by inserting (50) into (21)\n\u1e56 +\n\n1\n8\nP + p \u03c3 = 0,\n\u03c4\n5\n\n(59)\n\nA comparison between (52) and (59) shows that the full equation is equivalent to the truncated one if P/p \u226a 1 and 1/\u03c4 \u226a 4\u0398/3. The first condition\nsimply requires small deviations from equilibrium (as shown by (51)) and is\ncompatible with energy conditions [15]. However, the condition 4\u03c4 \u226b 3/\u0398\nis more problematic and is only reasonable after matter and radiation have\ndecoupled, hence, under the assumptions underlying the thermodynamic\nstudy of the models, the truncated equation cannot describe the interacting period nor the decoupling process. This shortcoming of (21) has been\ndiscussed previously for the parabolic case [26]. As shown by Figure. 6b,\nthis situation holds also for the elliptic and hyperbolic cases.\nIn order to complete the analysis we compute the Jeans mass associated\n(s)\nto the initial conditions of the case \u2206i 6= 0. This mass is given by[9],[8],[6]\n\n\f14\n\n#3/2\n\"\n\u0014 4 2 \u00153/2\n4\u03c0 c4 \u03c7i \u03931/2\nc \u03c0Cs\n\u03c0y 2 \u03a8\n4\u03c0\n(m)\nq\n=\n,\nmn\nMJ =\n\u00012\n3\nG (\u03c1 + p)\n3\n(r)\n3G \u03a8 + 34 \u03c7i y\n\u03c1i\n(60)\nr\nwhere \u03c1, p, n(m) are given by (14), (17) and (40), \u03c7i = \u03c1m\n/\u03c1\n,\n\u03a8\nand\n\u0393\ni\ni\nfollow from (33) and Cs is the speed of sound, which for the equation of\nstate (14), has the form\n\nCs2\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\n3\u03c1(m)\nc2\n1+\n=\n,\n3\n4\u03c1(r)\n\n\u03c1(m) = mc2 n(m) ,\n\n\u03c1(r) = 3n(r) kB T.\n\n(61)\n\n(r)\n\nEvaluating (60) for y = yD \u2248 102.4 , \u01eb \u2248 1/\u03c7i \u2248 103 and \u03c1i \u2248 aB Ti4 \u2248\n7.5 \u00d7 109 ergs/cm3 , yields MJ \u2248 1049 gm, or approximately 1016 M \u2299. This\nvalue coincides with the Jeans mass obtained for perturbative models dominated by baryons in the radiative era as decoupling is approached. Finally,\nit is worthwhile remarking that we are dealing with an epoch where a\ncosmological constant or a quintessence component should be clearly subdominant [27] and ignored.\nIX.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have derived and discussed important generic properties of a class\nof exact solutions of Einstein's equations that generalize the famous LTB\nsolutions with a dust source to an imperfect fluid with anisotropic pressure\n\u03a0ab . The integration of the field equations does not involve \u03a0ab , though\nonce this integration is done this pressure becomes also determined (up to\ninitial conditions). The issue regarding the compatibility of \u03a0ab and its\nevolution law with the physical assumptions underlining the models have\nbeen addressed. These models provide a physically plausible hydrodynamical description of cosmological matter-radiation mixture in the radiative\nera, between nucleosynthesis and decoupling. By assuming small initial\ndensity contrasts (consistent with small deviations from equilibrium), we\nhave shown that the state variables of the models are qualitatively and\nformally analogous to that of adiabatic perturbations on a FLRW background. We have also found two classes of initial conditions, based on well\ndefined initial contrast functions, that are formally equivalent to the definition of adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic perturbations on initial value func(r)\n(m)\ntions \u03c1i , \u03c1i , (3) Ri . In particular, we showed that for quasi-adiabatic\ninitial conditions the models are thermodynamically consistent and physically acceptable. However, this consistency does not hold for the truncated\ntransport equation (as shown also in [26]), only for the full transport equation of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics the relaxation time of shear\nviscosity has the appropriate physical behavior.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by the National University of Mexico\n(UNAM) under grant DGAPA-IN-122498 (to RS), Ontario Graduate Scholarship for Science and Technology and Ontario Graduate Scholarship to\n\n\f15\n(MI).

The integral\nyields either an implicit function ct = Z(y, \u03bc, \u03c9, \u03ba) where Z is defined by\n(32) (the \"canonical solution\"), or a parametric solution having the form\ny = y(\u03b7, r), t = t(\u03b7, r). The canonical solution of the equation equivalent\nto (22) found in the literature for the LTB dust case [1],[2], is usually given\nin the form c[t \u2212 t0 (r)] = Z(y, \u03bc, \u03ba), where the function t0 (r) comes as an\nintegration constant. Instead, we will provide the canonical solutions in\nthe form c(t \u2212 ti ) = Z \u2212 Zi , so that we can identify t0 (r) = ti + Zi . The\nfunction t0 (r) can also be identified as the \"big bang time\". Only for \u03ba = 0\nthe canonical solution can be inverted as y = y(t, r) by solving a cubic\n\n\f16\nequation, however the resulting expression is too cumbersome and will not\nbe given.\nAll variables introduced in previous sections will be made fully determined as functions of y and of r, with the dependence on r given through\nthe initial value functions and their initial contrast functions. As usual in\nthe study of dust LTB solutions, we will classify the integrals (32) in three\ncases: \"parabolic\" (\u03ba = 0), \"elliptic\" (\u03ba > 0) and \"hyperbolic\" (\u03ba < 0).\nWe shall examine each case separately below.\n1.\n\nParabolic case.\n(k)\n\n(3)\n\nRi = \u2206i = 0, then (32) leads to the canonical form\ni\n\u221a\n4 hp\nc(t \u2212 ti ) = Z \u2212 Zi = \u221a\n2y + \u01eb1 (y \u2212 \u01eb1 ) \u2212 2 + \u01eb1 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\n(A1)\n3 \u03bc\n\nIf \u03ba = 0, so that\n\nwhere \u01eb1 was defined in (25).

If \u03c1i = h\u03c1i i = 0, then \u03c9 = 0 and Q = (\u2212\u03bay + 2\u03bc)y,\n(m)\nhence we have: \u03c1 = \u03c1(m) = \u03c1i /(y 3 \u0393) and p = P = 0, and so the\nsolutions reduce to the \"usual\" LTB solutions with a dust source.\n(k)\n(m)\nThe initial density and curvature contrasts \u2206i , \u2206i have the same\ninterpretation as in the general case. Notice that B = 0 (from (14a))\nand that the auxiliary functions \u03a8, \u03a6 are irrelevant in this sub-case.\n\u2022 FLRW limit. Homogeneity along the initial hypersurface follows\n(m)\n(m)\n(k)\n(r)\n(m)\n= \u2206i = \u2206i = 0, leading to \u03c1i = h\u03c1i i,\nby demanding \u2206i\n(r)\n(m)\n(r)\n(r)\n\u03c1i = h\u03c1i i, (3) Ri = h(3) Ri i, so that \u03c1i , \u03c1i , (3) Ri are constants.\nEquation (22) implies then that \u03bc, \u03c9, \u03ba are also constants, so that\nM, W \u221d Yi3 and K \u221d Yi2 . Therefore y obtained by integrating (22)\nmust be a function of t only and Y = R(t)Yi . From (33) to (35) we\nhave: \u0393 = \u03a8 = 1 and \u03a6 = 0 leading to \u03c1 = \u03c1(t), p = p(t), P = 0\nand \u03c3 = 0, \u0398 = 3\u1e8f/y = 3\u1e58/R. Thus the particular case in which\ninitial density and curvature contrasts vanish is the FLRW limit of\nthe solutions, a FLRW cosmology where \u03c1, p satisfy the \"dust plus\nradiation\" relation (6).\n(m)\n\n(r)\n\n\u2022 Vaidya limit. If \u03c1i > 0, \u03c1i > 0 for 0 \u2264 r < rb but vanish for\n(r)\n(m)\nr \u2265 rb , then h\u03c1i i and h\u03c1i i, as well as M and W are constants\nfor r \u2265 rb and we have (along this range) a sub-case of the Vaidya\nmetric characterized by the mass function m = M (rb ) + W (rb )Yi /Y .\nThis particular Vaidya solution is the \"exterior\" field for the models\nderived in this paper, generalizing the Schwarzschild exterior of LTB\ndust solutions. Notice that as the fluid expands the Vaidya mass\nfunction, m, tends to a constant Schwarzschild mass given by M (rb ).\nMore details are provided in [15].\nThe solutions derived in this paper can be smoothly matched along a\ncomoving hypersurface marked by r = rb with their FLRW and Vaydia subcases. The matching conditions are discussed in detail in [15]. Just as LTB\ndust solutions can be generalized to the Szekeres dust solutions without\nisometries, LTB solutions with an imperfect fluid source can be generalized\nto the Szafron-Szekeres metrics with an imperfect fluid source[15]. Even\nwithout spherical symmetry, these solutions can still be smoothly matched\nto the FLRW and Vaydia sub-cases along a spherical comoving boundary\n[15].\n\n\f19\nFIG. 1: (a) Logarithmic plot of the densities ratio. These densities are positive\ndefinite and decreasing functions of log10 (y); The plot also shows that for the early\nstage the radiation density dominates while for later stages the matter density\ndominates. (b) The ratio P/p is very small complying with energy condition. P\nis negative/positive for lumps/voids respectively.

Initially, the ratio \u03c4 /tH is far\nlarger than t\u03b3 /tH but become comparable to it near the decoupling hypersurface\ndefined by t\u03b3 = tH . Note the similarity in the qualitative behavior of these\ntwo ratios. This plot shows also how the Compton time is important for high\ntemperatures (near log10 (y) = 0) but rapidly overtakes tH and so Compton\nscattering is no longer an efficient radiative process. Thompson scattering is very\nsmall initially but becomes the dominant process near decoupling. The relaxation\ntime \u03c4 is a mesoscopic quantity that acts roughly as an \"average\" timescale for\nall these processes.\n\nFIG. 6: Plot of log10 (\u03c4 /tH ) in terms of log10 (y), (a) for adiabatic conditions\n(s)\n|\u2206i | = 0, \u03c4 /tH is always smaller then 1, so \u03c4 does not overtake tH , (b) For \u03c4\ndefined from the truncated equation (49c) \u03c4 /tH is always smaller then 1 as well.\n\n(s)\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of log10 (\u03c4 ) in terms of log10 (y) and log 10 (|\u2206i |), \u03c4 is a positive\n(s)\ndefinite and increasing function for 10\u22128 \u2264 |\u2206i | \u2264 10\u22123 and for all evolution\nrange.\n\n\f1.5\n\nlog rho[r]/rho[m]\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u20130.5\n\u20131\n0\n\n\u20135\n0.5\n\n\u20134.5\n\n1\n\n\u20134\n\n1.5\n\nlog y\n\n\u20133.5\n\n2\n\u20133\n\n2.5\n\u20132.5\n\nlog |Ds|\n\n\f0\n\u20130.02\n\nP/p\n\n\u20130.04\n\u20130.06\n\u20130.08\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.5\n\n\u20138\n1\n\n\u20137\n1.5\n\n\u20136\n\nlog y\n\n2\n\n\u20135\n2.5\n\n\u20134\n3\n\n\u20133\n\nlog |Ds|\n\n\f1.14\n1.12\nGamma\n\n1.1\n1.08\n1.06\n\n1.04\n1.02\n1\n0\n\n\u20138\n0.5\n\n\u20137\n1\n\n\u20136\n1.5\n\nlog |Ds|\n\nlog y\n\n\u20135\n\n2\n\u20134\n\n2.5\n3\n\n\u20133\n\n\f1\n0.98\n0.96\nGamma\n\n0.94\n0.92\n0.9\n0.88\n0.86\n\u20138\n\n0\n0.5\n\n\u20137\n1\n\n\u20136\n1.5\n\nlog |Ds|\n\nlog y\n\n\u20135\n\n2\n\u20134\n\n2.5\n3\n\n\u20133\n\n\f5\n4\n\nlog tau\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u20131\n\u20138\n\u20137\nlog Ds \u20136\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\nlog\ny\n1\n\n\u20135\n\u20134 0\n\n0.5\n\n\f2\n\nlog tau/tH\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u20130.5\n\u20138\n2.5\n\n\u20137\n2\n\u20136\nlog Ds\n\n1.5\nlog\ny\n1\n\n\u20135\n\n0.5\n\u20134\n\n\f1.5\n\nlog tau/tH\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u20130.5\n\u20135.5\n\u20135\n\u20134.5\nlog Ds\n\u20134\n\u20133.5\n\u20133 0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n1 log y\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\f4\n\nt[c]/t[H]\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlog y\n1.5\n\n0\ntau/t[H]\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\nt[gamma]/t[H]\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\f\u20130.44\n\u20130.46\nlog tau/tH\n\n\u20130.48\n\u20130.5\n\n\u20130.52\n\u20130.54\n\n\u20136\n4\n\u20135\nlog Dr\n\n3\n2\nlog y\n\n\u20134\n1\n\u20133\n\n\f\u20130.602\n\u20130.603\n\nlog tau/tH\n\n\u20130.604\n\u20130.605\n\u20130.606\n\u20130.607\n\u20130.608\n\u20138\n4\n\n\u20137\n\n3\n\u20136\nlog |Ds|\n\n2\nlog y\n\n\u20135\n\n1\n\u20134\n\n\f"}
