In the standard model the charged\nfermion masses are generated through the Higgs coupling\nat the tree level. Thus, by tuning of the Yukawa coupling constants, it is possible to accommodate all the\nfermion masses and mixing angles in the theory as free\nparameters. However, fermion masses are spread in a\nlarge range. So we are compelled to assume Yukawa coupling from \u2248 10\u22126 for the electron until to \u2248 1 for the\ntop quark. It is an experimental fact that the charged\nfermion masses increase systematically from the first to\nthe third generation. The standard model gives no explanation for this hierarchy and why the fermion masses,\nexcept the top quark one, are small relative to the electroweak scale (vW = 246 GeV).\nRecent experiments on solar [1], atmospheric [2] and\nterrestrial [3] neutrino oscillation considerably improved\nour understanding about neutrino masses and mixings.\nThese laboratories experiments have been complemented\nby cosmological data, mainly by the satellite WMAP,\nthat\nP has put a limit on the sum of neutrino masses\n[ mi \u2264 (0.7 \u2212 2.0) eV ] [4].\nIn order to give a satisfactory explanation to these\nphenomena basically two types of models have been attempted: seesaw and radiative corrections. The seesaw\nmechanism is interesting because it establishes that one\nfermion mass is heavy at the expense of another to be\nlight, leading to a route to understand the mass hierarchy\nproblem [5, 6]. It is possible also that the seesaw schemes\ncan be able to explain other very disparate scales in the\nframework of particle physics [7]. However, the usual\nseesaw mechanism for small neutrino masses requires the\nintroduction of a dimension-five operator and a high energy scale [5].\nOn the other hand, it should be natural to interpret\n\nthe light fermion masses as generated by higher orders\nof perturbative expansions [8, 9]. Both, seesaw and radiative correction schemes are possibilities that exist in\nextensions of the standard model.\nFermion mass generation by radiative corrections necessarily evolves the introduction of some set of symmetries. This is to avoid the light fermions from picking\ntheir masses from the tree level through their coupling\nto the Higgs boson multiplets with nonzero vacuum expectation values [9]. Another good feature of the radiative generation mechanism is that the masses radiatively\ngenerated can be calculable as functions the heavy lepton\nones [10].\nIn this work we examine these problems for the case\nof the leptons in the context of an electroweak model\nbased on SU(3)L \u2297U(1)N (3-3-1 for short) semi simple\nsymmetry group [11, 12, 13].\nThere are in the literature several versions of the 3-3-1\nmodel [11, 12, 14]. Some of them can include mechanisms\nfor neutrino mass generation [15, 16, 17]. It is important\nto keep in mind that 3-3-1 model was not specifically\nproposed to solve the fermion mass problem. For the\noriginal motivations of the model see Refs. [11, 12].\nHere we show that in a variant of the model of the Refs.\n[11, 12] we can combine the good features from the seesaw\nmechanism and radiative corrections, which together are\na very powerful tool, in order to obtain relations among\nthe lepton masses. These relations are more general that\nthe ones obtained by other models and, perhaps more\nimportantly, the new energy scale is lower than the ones\nrequired by the other models. All the realizations of the\nusual seesaw models based on SU(2)\u2297U(1) symmetry require energies in the range 1013 GeV to 1016 GeV [5].\nWe will see that in our proposal we do not need a so high\nenergy scale to implement the seesaw mechanism.\nWe discuss also the mixing angles for the neutrinos,\nbut in our model the mixing occurs, in principle, among\nfour neutrino states. However, the pattern of this mixing\n\n\f2\nfor the standard neutrino sector is of the LMA (large\nmixing angle) type.\nOur work is organized as follow. In the Sec. II we\npresent the relevant aspects of the model. In the Sec. III\nwe describe the scheme for charged lepton mass generation, while in Sec. IV we present the model for neutrino\nmasses generation and mixings. Finally in Sec. V we\nhave our conclusions and comments.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nIn the original version of the 3-3-1 model a scalar sextet was introduced, in addition to a set of three scalar\ntriplets, in order to give the correct charged lepton mass\npattern at the tree level [12, 13]. If the sextet is not\npresent the 3 \u00d7 3 charged lepton mass matrix is antisymmetric, leading to one null and two degenerate mass\neigenstates. However, was indicated a more simple solution to this problem, i.e., we can eliminate the sextet of\nthe scalar sector and to introduce an extra charged heavy\nlepton singlet in the leptonic sector [18].\nAmong all possible extensions of the standard model\nthe class of the 3-3-1 models is one of most interesting. In this class of electroweak models the anomalies\ncancellation mechanism requires the number of fermion\nfamilies to be a multiple of three. In addition, if we to\ntake in account that the asymptotic freedom condition\nof QCD imposes that the number of generations is less\nthan five, so the model predicts one unique three families\ngroup [11, 12]. Also, the Weinberg mixing angle is upper\nbounded in these models, i. e., sin2 \u03b8W < 1/4. Therefore,\nthe evolution of sin \u03b8W to high values leads to an upper\nbound on the new mass scale for symmetry breaking of\nthis model [12, 19]. A feature of great phenomenological\ninterest is that the model can manifest itself in a scale of\nseveral hundred of GeV or a few TeV. In addition, some\nof the 3-3-1 processes accessible to next generation of accelerators violates individual lepton numbers. For this\nreason, they are free of the standard model background\n[20]. Therefore, 3-3-1 model is phenomenologically well\nmotivated.\nHere we work with the version of the model that includes a charged lepton singlet [17, 18]. The lepton representation content in the interaction (primed) eigenstates\nis\n\uf8eb \u2032 \uf8f6\n\u03bda\n\u03a8aL = \uf8ed l\u2032a \uf8f8 \u223c (3, 0) ,\n(1a)\nC\nl\u2032 a L\nEL\u2032 ,\n\n\u2032\nER\n\u223c (1, \u22121) ,\n\nNR\u2032 \u223c (1, 0) ,\n\n(1b)\n\n\u2032\nwhere the subscript a = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 is a family index and EL,R\nare charged exotic lepton singlets. It should be noticed\nin Eqs. (1b) that, differently to the Ref. [18], we are\nincluding the neutral lepton singlet NR (see Ref. [17]).\nIt is required by the recent experimental results on solar\n\n[1] and atmospheric [2] neutrino oscillations that indicate\nthe presence of four neutrino states.\nAs in the original version, this model predicts two double charged gauge bosons, two single charged and one\nneutral in addition to the standard W \u00b1 and Z 0 [11, 12].\nThe quark sector coincides with the one of the original\nmodel.\nIn order to give the fermion and gauge boson masses\nand account for the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the\nscalar triplets\n\uf8eb 0 \uf8f6\n\uf8eb + \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u2212 \uf8f6\n\u03b7\n\u03c1\n\u03c7\n\u03b7 = \uf8ed \u03b71\u2212 \uf8f8 , \u03c1 = \uf8ed \u03c10 \uf8f8 , \u03c7 = \uf8ed \u03c7\u2212\u2212 \uf8f8 , (2)\n\u03c1++\n\u03c70\n\u03b72+\ntransforming as (3, 0), (3, 1) and (3, \u22121), respectively,\nare introduced. We will see below that the \u03b7 triplet does\nnot contribute to the masses of the leptons of the second\nand third generations. However, it is fundamental for the\ngeneration of the masses of the electron and the neutrinos. The neutral components of the scalars fields \u03b7, \u03c1\nand \u03c7 develop the vacuum expectation values h\u03b7 0 i = v,\n2\nh\u03c10 i = u and h\u03c70 i = w with v 2 + u2 = vW\nand so, during\nthe spontaneous symmetry breaking process these neutral fields are shifted as \u03b70 \u2192 v+\u03be\u03b7 +i\u03b6\u03b7 , \u03c10 \u2192 u+\u03be\u03c1 +i\u03b6\u03c1\nand \u03c70 \u2192 w + \u03be\u03c7 + i\u03b6\u03c7 .\nWe wish only the third generation and the exotic lepton singlets E and N get masses at the tree level. Therefore, to avoid undesirable mass terms for the electron and\nthe muon and its neutrinos at the tree level, we must\neliminate their couplings through the \u03b7 scalar. Thus, we\ndefine a charge whose operators are given by\n\u03a9\u03c6 =\n\n\u221a\n\n3\n\u03bb8 + X\u03c6 ,\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03a8L , EL,R\n, NR\u2032 , \u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c7 and \u03bb8 is the usual\nnotation for the diagonal Gell-Mann matrix. In the following, we assign the values X\u03c6 = \u22121/3 for \u03c6 = \u03a8, \u03b7 and\n\u03c1, and X\u03c6 = 2/3 for \u03c6 = \u03c7. In order to become easier to\nrecognize all participating and forbidden interactions in\nthe Lagrangians, we list all the \u03a9\u03c6 charges for the fields\nin the Eqs.

The model obeys approximately an extra U(1)\u03a9\nsymmetry which is not spontaneously broken, but is\nslight violated by an explicit electron mass term. The\nheavy lepton masses satisfy seesaw relations, while the\nlight masses, except the electron and the electron neutrino ones are generated by one loop radiative corrections\nscheme. We notice that in the realistic range of the parameters the muon mass expressed in the formula\n(17)\n\u0001\ngives the relation m\u03bc m\u03c4 mE \u2248 fe fe\u2032 + f\u03bc f\u03bc\u2032 uw\u03be.\nIn the context of the three neutrino states, data on\noscillations and masses establish the particular quasibimaximal form to the neutrino mixing matrix [25]. A\ncareful analysis of the experimental data furnishes the\npresent range of the lepton mixing matrix as [29]\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0.72 \u2212 0.88 0.46 \u2212 0.68\n< 0.22\n|Vex | = \uf8ed 0.25 \u2212 0.65 0.27 \u2212 0.73 0.55 \u2212 0.84 \uf8f8 . (31)\n0.10 \u2212 0.57 0.41 \u2212 0.80 0.52 \u2212 0.83\nWhen we compare the matrix (31) with the 3\u00d73 mixing matrix obtained of Eq. (30) by elimination of the\nfourth line and fourth column we can see that our numerical result for the lepton mixing is not in the experimental range. However, in this model the mixing matrix\ndeserves a most detailed study. The numerical example that we take here is not only the possible one. Another fact that we must lead in account is that the mass\nmatrix (8) of the charged leptons is diagonalized by a\nbiunitary transformation. The diagonalization process\ndoes not fix all the elements of the mixing matrices (20a)\nand (20b). Three of them, it does not import which of\nthem, remain free. Here, for sake of simplicity, we cho(l)\n(l)\n(l)\nsen UL (3, 2) = UL (4, 4) = UR (4, 4) = 0. However, we\n(l)\nhave checked that the UL (3, 2), for example, can be used\nfor improve the fit of our results. Moreover, we must to\nremember that the mixing matrices (20a) and (29) that\nwe use to construct the matrix (30) are approached, that\n\n\f8\nis, they do not take in account the radiative corrections\nthat generate the masses of muon and of the neutrino of\nmuon.\nAttempts to explain the shift from the exact bimaximal form for \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 are based on three effects: (i)\nfrom neutrino mixing becoming the charged lepton mixing [26], (ii) from radiative corrections [27] and (iii) from\nthe symmetry breaking [28]. In our model the potential source of shift is the radiative correction processes\nleading to the muon and muon neutrino masses. The\namount of the mixing in each eigenstate is function of\nthe values of the parameters chosen. The electron mass,\nwhich induces a tiny breaking of the extra symmetry (3),\ncontributes also to this shift, but with a smaller quantity. However, in our numerical example the LMA form\nis preserved in the sector of the three standard neutrinos, as is required by the experiments. In the charged\nsector, the mixing angles are also large [see Eqs. (20)],\nso the concept of family in the lepton sector, in this sense,\nmeaningless.\n\nOur model is able to explain all the present experimental data on charged and neutral leptons, explaining the\nphenomenology within a reasonable scheme. This model\nnaturally introduce de seesaw type relations, through an\nU(1) symmetry combining the good features of this mechanism with a radiative corrections scheme. The new mass\nscale is in the order of a few TeV. Therefore, this model\ncan be confirmed or ruled out by the next generation of\naccelerators, what is a common feature of the class of\n3-3-1 models.\n\n[1] SNO Collaboration, Q. R.
