Introduction\nAn accurate estimate of disconnected contributions to flavor singlet quantities remains one of\nthe most computationally demanding problems in hadronic physics. The most commonly adopted\napproach is to apply stochastic methods in order to estimate the quark propagator. A number of\nmethods to reduce the stochastic noise inherent in such an approach has been developed and their\nrespective merits investigated in detail in Ref. [1]. Such methods typically require large numbers\nof Dirac matrix inversions and hardware accelerators, such as graphics processors (GPUs), can\ndramatically accelerate these inversions [2].\nThe main goal of the present study is two-fold: Firstly, we compute the disconnected contribution to the flavor-singlet pseudo-scalar meson, \u03b7 0 , mass which is also related to the UA (1) anomaly\nin QCD. Here, this is used as a case-study for the purposes of evaluating the efficacy of the implementation. Secondly, we examine the efficiency of various stochastic noise reduction techniques.\nMore precisely, at this stage, we consider two techniques of variance reduction: partitioning (or\ndilution) [3] and the truncated solver method [4]. We performed an exact evaluation of the disconnected loops for N f = 2 Wilson fermions on a lattice of size 163 \u00d7 32 using GPUs. The calculation\nis then repeated using stochastic methods. The exact calculation gives us an accurate benchmark\nby which to compare all stochastic variance reduction methods and explicitly exposes the gauge\nnoise underlying each quantity to be measured.\n\n2. Lattice ensemble and simulation parameters\nFor this exploratory study we use N f = 2 Wilson fermions at \u03b2 = 5.6 and hopping parameter\n\u03ba = 0.157, which corresponds to pion mass of m\u03c0 = 884 MeV on a lattice of size 163 \u00d7 32 [5]. The\nlattice spacing is a = 0.08 fm as determined from the nucleon mass at the physical point [6]. For\nconstructing the meson propagators we utilized both local and smeared quark fields. In the latter\ncase, we apply gauge-covariant Gaussian smearing using a range of smearing parameters.\nThe stochastic estimate of the disconnected quark loops is performed using complex Z2 noise\nfor the source vectors in combination with several partitioning (dilution) schemes and the truncated\nsolver method [1]. Specifically, we consider various combinations of space, spin and color dilution\nschemes. Colour dilution leads to a multiplicative factor of 3 for the number of inversions. In spin\nspace, a full dilution leads to a factor of 4 for the inversions. In this case an even-odd partitioning\nof the space can alternatively be employed leading to an increase of a factor of 2 in the number of\ninversions. For spatial dilutions, in addition to an even-odd dilution, we have also applied a cubic\ndilution, where separate sources are placed on each vertex of an elementary 3-d cube and repeated\nthroughout the lattice, leading to an increase of a factor of 8 in the number of inversions. Time\ndilution is applied in all cases and translational invariance exploited so that this does not increase\nthe number of required inversions.\nThe truncated solver method [1] effectively partitions the problem into a low precision and\nhigh precision space. A large number of low precision inversions are carried out to achieve an\napproximation to the propagator with low stochastic error (but only accurate to low precision). A\nhigh precision stochastic correction is then applied using a small ensemble with the corresponding\ninversions carried out to high precision. We use a stochastic ensemble of 5000 noise vectors for the\n2\n\n\fA. \u00d3 Cais\n\nExact calculation of disconnected loops\n\nlow precision space with an ensemble of 500 noise vectors for the high-precision correction. The\ninversion tolerance for the low precision was chosen to be 10\u22126 such that one can restrict oneself to\na single precision conjugate gradient inversion (which is very efficient on GPU accelerators), while\nin the case of full precision the tolerance was set to 10\u221210 . The ensemble sizes were chosen to be\nquite large in order to avoid any quantity-specific tuning of the ensemble sizes.\nFinally, as was already mentioned, the exact evaluation of the all-to-all propagator is also\ncarried out. This is clearly the most computational intensive part, and was only possible due to\nthe use of graphics accelerators employing the QUDA library (as was used for all inversions),\nwhich provides mixed precision implementations of CG and BiCGstab solvers for the NVIDIA\nCUDA platform [7]. This provides a benchmark at the level of gauge-noise for all quantities with\ncontributions from disconnected loops.\n\n3. Results\nFor all-to-all propagators, a general isovector two-point correlation function, CBA (p, \u2206t), for\nthe creation of a particle at timeslice t with momentum p from the operator \u0393A and its annihilation\nat timeslice t + \u2206t with the operator \u0393B is given by,\nCBA (p, \u2206t) = \u2212\n\n1\nL3 T\n\n\u2211 hTr(SF (y,t; x,t + \u2206t)\u0393B (p)SF (x,t + \u2206t; y,t)\u0393A (p))i,\n\n(3.1)\n\nx,y,t\n\nwhere SF (x,t; x0 ,t 0 ) is the propagator from spacetime point (x,t) to spacetime point (x0 ,t 0 ), spin\nand colour indices are suppressed and phases for momentum projections (and quark smearing operations) are incorporated into the definition of the operators \u0393A and \u0393B . For isoscalar quantities,\ndisconnected loops give a contribution DBA (p, \u2206t) to the correlation function,\nDBA (p, \u2206t) = \u2212\n\n1\nL3 T\n\n\u2211 hTr(SF (x,t; x,t)\u0393B (p)SF (y,t + \u2206t; y,t + \u2206t)\u0393A (p))i,\n\n(3.2)\n\nx,y,t\n\nIn our particular case of the \u03b7 0 meson in an N f = 2 gauge ensemble, if we suppress all operator and\nmomentum indices,\nC\u03b7 0 (t) = C\u03c0 (t) \u2212 2D(t).\n(3.3)\nFor mesons on lattices with periodic boundary conditions C(t) \u223c e\u2212mt + e\u2212m(NT \u2212t) for t large\n(where NT is the lattice temporal extent). We can therefore analyze the ratio of the disconnected\nquark loop, D(t), and connected correlation function, C\u03c0 (t), to extract the flavour-singlet pseudoscalar meson mass,\ne\u2212m\u03b7 0 t + e\u2212m\u03b7 0 (NT \u2212t)\nD(t)\n\u223ct\u2192\u221e A \u2212 B \u2212m t\n,\n(3.4)\nC\u03c0 (t)\ne \u03c0 + e\u2212m\u03c0 (NT \u2212t)\nwhere m\u03c0 and m\u03b7 0 are the masses of the \u03c0 and \u03b7 0 mesons and A, B are additional fit parameters.\nm\u03c0 can be determined separately to the 1% level and inserted as a prior leaving only 3 parameters\nin the fit function. This approach also accounts for independent smearing of the connected and\ndisconnected loops.\nIn the case of the exact evaluation, the only source of error comes from the statistical error\nof the gauge ensemble, and therefore we will employ this fact to assess the results obtained using\n3\n\n\fA. \u00d3 Cais\n\nExact calculation of disconnected loops\n\nRatio of Disconnected to Connected\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\nt/a\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 1: Ratio CD(t)\nfor the \u03b7 0 meson computed using exact approach (without smearing in red and with\n\u03c0 (t)\nsmearing in green colours).\n\nstochastic methods. We compare exact results for the ratio D(t)/C\u03c0 (t) obtained with local quark\nfield operators with those obtained with smeared quark fields in Fig. 1. Given that m\u03c0 can be\ndetermined to the 1% level it is clear that the gauge noise derived from the disconnected loops in\nthis quantity is large. A naive fitting of the data constrained between tmin = 2a and tmax = 11a gives\na value for the mass amL\u03b7 0 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 and amS\u03b7 0 = 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 for local and smeared operators,\nrespectively. Here we used am\u03c0 = 0.3454(19). On the other hand, fitting in the range tmin = 3a and\ntmax = 11a gives us accordingly amL\u03b7 0 = 0.51 \u00b1 0.07 and amS\u03b7 0 = 0.49 \u00b1 0.09.\nIf we look at the same quantities using the truncated solver method, the corresponding plots in\nlogarithmic scale (for local and smeared operators) are given in Fig. 2. The results of fitting in the\nrange tmin = 2a and tmax = 10a gives amL\u03b7 0 = 0.42 \u00b1 0.07 for local fields and amS\u03b7 0 = 0.42 \u00b1 0.06 for\nsmeared fields, respectively. Fitting in the range tmin = 3a and tmax = 10a provides the following\nestimates for the pseudo-scalar mass: amL\u03b7 0 = 0.57 \u00b1 0.11 and amS\u03b7 0 = 0.51 \u00b1 0.1. These results\nare summarized in Table 3. The value of am\u03b7 0 = 0.40(5) is relatively consistent with the results\nobtained using N f = 2 twisted mass fermions at m\u03c0 \u223c 500 MeV [8].\nWe have also considered the stochastic estimate of the disconnected diagrams using Z2 noise\nand 2 different approaches. First, we examine the number of noise vectors required such that\none can reach a level of stochastic accuracy consistent with the statistical noise of the gaugefield\nensemble. To this end, we have inspected the trace of zero-momentum projected disconnected loop\nTr(SF (x, x)\u0393), for a range of operators \u0393. For example, for the particular case of a dilution approach\nwith a \u03b35 operator insertion, the left of Fig. 3 shows the dependency of the magnitude of the error in\nthe trace on the number of noise vectors.

As a\nreference, we also plot the optimal statistical error (behaving as \u221aN1 ) extrapolating from the first\ninv\ndata point to show the expected behaviour of increasing the ensemble size. Finally we insert the\ngauge-level noise (from the exact calculation) at the point where this gauge error is consistent with\noverall error from the optimal error extrapolation. As one can see, in the case of the \u03b35 -operator the\ndilution approach is consistent with the optimal statistical error and one needs at least 37 inversions\nto achieve gauge noise accuracy. A similar analysis can be done for other disconnected loops, on\nthe right of Fig. 1 we show results for an identity operator insertion, where the gauge noise can be\nreached with just 5 noise vectors and, consequently, dilution can have no beneficial effect for the\nmeasurement. Clearly, the size of the stochastic ensemble required is operator-dependent, as noted\nin Ref. [1].\nIn Fig. 4, we show similar plots for a \u03b31 \u03b33 operator insertion.

On the\nright we plot the same data for the specific cases where full spin dilution is used. As can be seen,\nspin dilution has, in this case, a dramatic effect that allows the achievement of gauge level noise\nwithin 174 inversions. This effect is likely due to the strong off-diagonal nature of this gamma\ncombination in this basis and has been also been observed in other quantities. Also, we again\nobserve that dilution behaves consistently with the optimal statistical error.\n\n4. Summary\nWe have computed the disconnected contribution to \u03b7 0 meson mass using both exact and\nstochastic evaluation. Stability in the fit region has not been observed and the level of noise from\nthe gaugefield ensemble is large, particularly at large separations. We have also compared the\n6\n\n1000\n\n\fA. \u00d3 Cais\n\nExact calculation of disconnected loops\n\ntruncated solver method against the exact approach in our attempt to evaluate the \u03b7 0 meson mass\nand find results consistent though non-conclusive between the two approaches. This is of course\ndue to the gaugefield ensemble noise inherent in the quantity for the sample.\nWe analyzed efficiency of different noise reduction techniques using the gaugefield ensemble\nnoise from the exact evaluation as a benchmark. We find that, on these lattices, for the stochastic\nmethods the gauge noise becomes the dominant source of the error already for 37 inversions in the\ncase of Tr(SF (x, x)\u03b35 ) and just 5 inversions in the case of Tr(SF (x, x)). The statistical error from\nusing the dilution approach appears to behave similarly to statistical noise in many cases for these\ntypes of operators. In particular cases however, such as Tr(SF (x, x)\u03b31 \u03b33 ), spin dilution has been\nseen to have a significant effect.\n\nAcknowledgments\nAlan \u00d3 Cais is supported by the Research Promotion Foundation of Cyprus under grant\n\u03a0PO\u03a3E\u039bKY\u03a3H/\u03a0PONE 0308/09.
