All waves emerged from\nthe same source active region, were accompanied by weak flares and faint CMEs,\nand propagated into the same direction at constant velocities in the range of\n\u223c 220 \u2212 340 km s\u22121 . The last of these four coronal wave events was the strongest\nand fastest, with a velocity of 337 \u00b131 km s\u22121 and a peak perturbation amplitude\nof \u223c 1.24, corresponding to a magnetosonic Mach number of Mms \u223c 1.09. The\nmagnetosonic Mach numbers and velocities of the four waves are distinctly correlated, suggestive of the nonlinear fast-mode magnetosonic wave nature of the\nevents. We also found a correlation between the magnetic energy build-up times\nand the velocity and magnetosonic Mach number.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nSubject headings: Sun: corona - Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - Sun:\nflares\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge-scale propagating disturbances in the solar corona have been subject of extensive\nstudies for more than twelve years. For the first time, these events were observed by the\nExtreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudini\u00e8re et al. 1995) onboard the Solar\nand Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO; Moses et al. 1997; Thompson et al. 1998), and are\nthus commonly called 'EIT-waves'. They appear as diffuse coronal brightenings, forming\ncircular wave fronts, traveling hundreds of Mm without hindrance under quiet-Sun conditions.\nAt present there are two competing groups of models based on completely different\nideas of the physical nature of EIT, or more generally, EUV waves. The first theory describes them as nonlinear fast-mode magnetosonic waves following the original interpretation\nof large-scale disturbances by Uchida (e.g. Thompson et al. 1998; Wills-Davey & Thompson\n1999; Wang 2000; Klassen et al. 2000; Wu et al. 2001; Vr\u0161nak et al. 2002; Warmuth et al.\n2004; Veronig et al. 2006). Several characteristics of coronal waves can be explained by\nthis theory: (1) the propagation perpendicular to magnetic field lines (e.g. Thompson et al.\n1998), (2) the pulse broadening and amplitude drop off (Wills-Davey 2006; Warmuth 2010;\nVeronig et al. 2010), (3) the reflection and refraction at regions of high Alfv\u00e9n velocity\n(Thompson et al. 1999; Veronig et al. 2008; Long et al. 2008; Gopalswamy et al. 2009). The\nsecond group of models, however, consider these coronal bright fronts as no waves at all,\nbut as the signature of a large-scale magnetic reconfiguration of field lines during a CME\nlift-off (e.g. Delann\u00e9e & Aulanier 1999; Chen et al. 2002; Attrill et al. 2007). In these pseudowaves models, coronal waves could exclusively occur in conjunction with CMEs. This assumption is supported by statistical studies, showing a close relation between waves and\nCMEs (e.g. Biesecker et al. 2002). These models can also explain stationary brightenings\n(Delann\u00e9e & Aulanier 1999; Cohen et al. 2009) and the occasionally observed rotation of\ncoronal bright fronts (Podladchikova & Berghmans 2005). For recent reviews we refer to\nVr\u0161nak & Cliver (2008), Wills-Davey & Attrill (2009) and Warmuth (2010).\nThe limitations of EIT observations, especially the low imaging cadence of \u223c12\u201315\nminutes, were a major contributor to the difficulties determining the physical nature of\ncoronal waves. The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004) instruments,\nwhich are part of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al. 2008) suite onboard the twin Solar-TErrestrial Relations Observatory\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(STEREO; Kaiser et al. 2008) spacecraft overcome these limitations. EUVI observes the\nentire solar disk as well as the corona up to 1.7 R\u2299 in four spectral channels (He II 304 \u00c5:\nT \u223c 0.07 MK; Fe IX 171 \u00c5: T \u223c 1 MK; Fe XII 195 \u00c5: T \u223c 1.5 MK; Fe XV 284 \u00c5: T \u223c 2.25\nMK). The high imaging cadence down to \u223c 75 seconds, the large FoV as well as the ability\nof simultaneous observations from two vantage points, provide us with new insights into\nthe three-dimensional kinematics and dynamics of EUV waves (e.g. Kienreich et al. 2009;\nPatsourakos & Vourlidas 2009; Veronig et al. 2010).\nIn this letter we present the first case of homologous EIT waves ever reported in the\nnearly 14 years of continuous studies of large-scale coronal waves. The four homologous\nwaves, observed by STEREO-B within a period of eight hours, were launched from the same\nAR, propagated in the same direction, and their wave fronts were similar in both shape and\nangular extent. These events allow us to perform a detailed study of the physical characteristics of large-scale coronal waves, as these homologous waves are initiated and propagate\nunder similar coronal background conditions. Hence, our analysis of the correlation between\nthe wave pulse parameters is not influenced by the limiting factor of differing coronal plasma\nconditions, persistent in previous comparative studies of EIT waves.\n\n2.\n\nData\n\nThe events under study occurred on 2010 April 28\u201329, and were observed by STEREOB (henceforth ST-B), positioned 70.5\u25e6 behind Earth on its orbit around the Sun. For our\nanalysis, only the high-cadence EUVI imagery in 195 \u00c5 (cadence of 5 minutes) was suitable,\nsince the 171 \u00c5 and 284 \u00c5 filtergrams were recorded only every 2 hours, and the 304 \u00c5 data\nrevealed no wave signatures at all. In addition, the white-light coronagraph (WLC) images\nof the COR1-B and COR2-B instruments (Howard et al. 2008) and of the Large Angle\nand Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) C2 instrument onboard\nSOHO were used to identify signatures of associated CMEs. The EUVI 195 \u00c5 filtergrams\nwere reduced using the SECCHI PREP routines available within Solarsoft. Additionally\nwe differentially rotated the images to the same reference time. In order to enhance faint\ncoronal wave signatures, we derived running ratio (RR) images dividing each direct image\nby a frame taken 10 minutes earlier.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nWave characteristics\n\nThe four EUV waves under study were launched on 2010 April 28\u201329 within a period\nof 8 hours (see Fig. 1). Movie 1 shows ST-B 195 \u00c5 direct and running ratio full disk images\ncovering the full observation period. Figure 1 consists of snapshots from the movie illustrating\nthe evolution of all four waves. In each column we present two fronts of each event, with the\nupper panels showing the wave front with the maximum intensity amplitude, and the lower\npanels showing the propagating wave front 20 minutes later. All four coronal disturbances\nare launched from the same AR NOAA 11067, propagate in the same direction and have a\nsimilar appearance and angular extent, thus it is appropriate to call them homologous. The\ntime interval between the onsets of the successive waves steadily increased: \u223c1.75 hr (wave\n1\u20132), \u223c2.5 hr (wave 2\u20133) and \u223c3.5 hr (wave 3\u20134). In order to obtain better insight into\nthe onset of the coronal waves, we studied a small area [FoV: 600\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 600\u2032\u2032 ] centered on the\nsource AR. Figure 2(f,g) gives one snapshot of this region during the launch of wave 4, the\nstrongest one of the four events. During the full observation period we recorded persisting\ndynamical processes in the extended loop system of NOAA 11067 (see movie 2 available as\nonline supplement).\nThe resemblance of the events suggests that the background coronal field has not\nchanged noticeably within these eight hours. Moreover, this implies that the corona is\ndisturbed by the EIT waves only for a short period of time and returns to its pre-event\ncondition on a timescale of tens of minutes. In at least two cases, waves 3 and 4, there is\nevidence that the main perturbation was followed by an additional weak disturbance about\n20 minutes later (see movie 1).\n\n3.2.\n\nWave kinematics and perturbation characteristics\n\nWe analyzed the kinematics of the waves, each treated as unique event, employing two\ndifferent methods. Firstly, we visually determined the wave fronts in a series of RR images.\nSecondly, we examined the perturbation amplitudes of the wave. In both methods we focused\non a 60\u25e6 sector on the solar surface, where all four waves were distinctly observable (see Fig. 1\npanel 7; yellow curves).\nIn the first method the wave fronts were tracked manually, and their center was obtained from a circular fit to the earliest wave fronts carried out in spherical coordinates (see\nVeronig et al. 2006). The mean distance of each wave front from the thus determined center\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nis calculated along the solar surface. In the second method we subdivided the solar surface\ninto spherical segments of equal width concentric around the wave center obtained by method\none. Plotting the average intensities versus mean distances of all segments gives one intensity\nprofile per RR image (cf. Muhr et al. 2010). In these perturbation profiles, shown in Fig. 4\n(top panels), the wave front presents itself as distinct bump above the background intensity.\nIn each case, the perturbation amplitude reaches its maximum \u223c5 minutes after the onset\nof the wave (see Fig. 4). As example, the evolution of the perturbation amplitude of wave\n4 is plotted in Fig. 3 (bottom panel). From the wave perturbation profiles we extracted the\nforemost position of the wave front, defined as the point at which the gaussian fit to the\nprofile falls below the value of I/I 0 = 1.02 (blue dotted line in top panel of Fig. 4). We note\nthat the visually tracked distances match well the position of the wave front obtained from\nthe perturbation profiles (Fig. 4).\nIn Fig. 3 (top panel) we show the kinematics for wave 4 derived with both methods\ntogether with error bars. Linear as well as quadratic least squares fits were applied to\nthe time-distance data, both yielding similar velocities of \u223c 340 km s\u22121 . The parabolic\nfit suggests a small deceleration of \u221210 m s\u22122 . In order to distinguish whether the linear\nor parabolic fit better represents the data, we derived the 95% confidence interval for the\nlinear fit. The quadratic fit lies within the error bars and the confidence interval, thus it is\nreasonable to represent the wave's kinematics by the linear fit with a constant velocity of\n337 \u00b1 31 km s\u22121 over the full propagation distance up to 800 Mm.\nWe found similar results for the other three wave events under study, which is illustrated\nin Fig. 4 (bottom panels). The velocities vc of the four homologous waves are: 257\u00b122 km s\u22121\n(wave 1), 219 \u00b1 18 km s\u22121 (wave 2), 249 \u00b1 18 km s\u22121 (wave 3) and 337 \u00b1 31 km s\u22121 (wave 4).\nAll peak perturbation profiles together with a gaussian fit are shown in Fig. 4 (top panel).\nThe perturbation profiles of all four waves are steepening and show an increase in amplitude\nin the early phase of their evolution until the peak perturbation amplitude Amax is reached.\nThe values Amax of all four waves are: 1.15 (wave 1), 1.1 (wave 2), 1.14 (wave 3) and 1.24\n(wave 4).\nThe bright fronts of coronal EUV waves are in general caused by a local temperature and\ndensity enhancement (plasma compression). Assuming that the change in density is more\nimportant than that in temperature, one can derive an estimate of the density jump from\nthe intensity amplitude A = I/I0 , N/N0 \u223c (I/I0 )1/2 . This implies for the peak amplitudes\nof the four homologous waves a maximum density jump of Xc = N/N0 = 1.07 (wave 1), 1.05\n(wave 2), 1.07 (wave 3), and 1.11 (wave 4).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.3.\n\nAssociated CMEs and flares\n\nThe analysis of EUVI, COR1 and COR2 images, covering both days of April 28\u201329,\nrevealed no clear evidence of associated CMEs. However, LASCO C2 recorded four faint\nCMEs, each entering the C2 FoV about 45 minutes after the first observation of a wave front\nby EUVI (cf. Fig. 2 (a)-(d) and movie 3). In the LASCO CME catalog just CMEs 2 \u2013 4\nare listed and classified as poor, only visible in C2 at position angles \u223c85\u25e6 . CMEs 3 and\n4 reveal additional bright features following the actual CME leading edge with at least the\nsame speed. These features resemble rather small scale ejecta than prominences trailing the\nleading edge and could be related to the above mentioned weak disturbances following wave\n3 and 4 (see movie 1). As the center of the source AR lies \u223c15\u25e6 behind the limb, as seen\nfrom SoHO, we experience low projection effects in the derived CME plane-of-sky velocities,\nwhich lie in the range of 140 \u2212 190 km s\u22121 (see Fig. 2 (e)). Setting the onset site to the solar\nlimb and onset time to the moment, EUVI observed the first front of the associated wave, we\nestimated for each of CMEs 2\u20134 an average initial velocity in the range of 370 \u2212 470 km s\u22121 .\nWe can speculate, that the kinematics shown in Fig. 2 (e) supports the idea of a strong\ndeceleration of the faint, i.e. low-density, CMEs during their early evolution.\nIn each of the four wave events, an increase in intensity in the central region of the\nsource loop system (see Fig. 2(g)), constituting weak flares, is observed \u223c 5 minutes before\nthe first recorded wave front. Since the wave events occurred behind the solar limb, as\nviewed from Earth, no GOES X-ray data are available to obtain the flare class. As the\ndetermined wave kinematics allows us to back-extrapolate the start of the wave (see Fig. 4;\nbottom panel), we can compare the timing of the flare commencement and the wave onsets\n(see also movie 2). Fig. 4 (middle panel) shows the evolution of the total intensity of the\ncentral region in the AR. Four distinct intensity peaks are discernible, which coincide with\nthe first observations of the four coronal waves. During these flaring phases we observe the\ndisappearance of several loops in the 195\u00c5 RR-images (see Fig. 2(f)), whose northern branch\nis rooted close to the flaring part of the AR. The coronal waves are, however, launched from\nthe opposite side and the shape of each first wave front exactly maps out the geometry of\nthe southern loop system.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nNever before in the nearly 14 years of continuous research of large-scale coronal waves\nhomologous EIT wave events were reported. We are the first to present a study of homologous EIT waves, emerging from the same AR within a short period of time. They travel\ninto the same direction and their fronts have similar shape and angular extent. They prop-\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nagate into a quiet Sun area, surrounded by ARs to the north and south and a large coronal\nhole close to the northern polar region (see movie 1). As is expected for nonlinear magnetosonic waves, they do not penetrate into these regions of increased Alfv\u00e9n velocity (see also\nVeronig et al. 2008; Gopalswamy et al. 2009). In our study we compared for the first time\ndifferent methods of deriving the wave kinematics, the (rather subjective) visual method and\nthe (more objective) profile method. Both methods yield consistent results, i.e. the waves\npropagate at constant velocities \u223c 220 km s\u22121 for the weakest wave up to \u223c 340 km s\u22121 for\nthe strongest event. Furthermore, we calculated the perturbation profiles to study the physical characteristics and evolution of the disturbances. The strong initial steepening of the\nperturbation amplitudes confirms that these features are indeed shocks, albeit only weak\nshocks, since they peak at low intensity values A < 1.25.\nAssuming these coronal waves to constitute large-scale fast magnetosonic waves, the\nmeasured velocities lie well within the velocity range of 210\u2212350 km s\u22121 for fast magnetosonic\nwaves for quiet Sun conditions. In the MHD approach the quantities defining a shock wave\nin the solar corona are: Mms . . . shock magnetosonic Mach number, Xc . . . density jump at\nthe shock front, \u03b8 . . . angle between shock front and magnetic field, \u03b2c . . . plasma-beta. They\nare related by the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions for an oblique shock (c.f. Priest 1982).\nConsidering a perpendicular shock the RH relation reduces to\ns\nXc (Xc + 5 + 5\u03b2c )\nMms =\n,\n(4 \u2212 Xc )(2 + \u03b3\u03b2c )\nwith a polytropic index \u03b3 of 5/3. Studies of Vr\u0161nak et al. (2002) indicate that \u03b2 \u2248 0.1 in\nthe quiet\n\u221a Sun's low corona. Using the previously calculated density jumps Xc (cf. Sect. 3.2,\nXc \u221d A), we derive for the peak magnetosonic Mach numbers Mms = 1.06 (wave 1), 1.04\n(wave 2), 1.05 (wave 3), and 1.09 (wave 4).\nWith these observations of homologous waves, we can for the first time perform a quantitative analysis of the characteristic wave parameters without any limiting factors like\nchanging or unknown quiet Sun background conditions. The top panel of Fig. 5 shows\nthe calculated magnetosonic Mach number versus the propagation velocities vc of the four\nwaves, revealing a distinct correlation between the wave characteristics Mms and vc with a\ncorrelation coefficient of R2 \u2248 0.99. Such correlation is expected for nonlinear fast-mode\nmagnetosonic waves because of the p\nrelation Mms = vc /vms (cf. Priest 1982), where vc is\nthe coronal wave speed and vms = vA2 + c2s the fast magnetosonic speed [vA . . . Alfv\u00e9n\nvelocity, cs . . . sound speed]. The mean magnetosonic speed, derived by averaging the four\nratios vc /Mms , yields 250 km s\u22121 and gives with cs = 180 km s\u22121 (T \u223c1.5 MK) a mean Alfv\u00e9n\nvelocity of vA = 175 km s\u22121 . Applying one\u2013 to five\u2013fold Saito coronal density models for a\npropagation height of \u223c 0.1RJ , we derive for the low corona during solar minimum condi-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntions a magnetic field strength between 1.5 \u2212 3.5 Gauss.\nThe magnetosonic Mach numbers of all four waves peak at values less than 1.10 and\ndrop off towards the linear regime (Mms \u2248 1) as the waves expand. These small magnetosonic Mach numbers together with the correlated wave velocities support the view that\neach observed coronal wave is a low-amplitude MHD fast-mode wave. Since Mms is even at\nthe maximum close to the linear regime, this also implies that the fast-mode MHD waves\nare expected to experience only minor deceleration. Since vc decreases proportional to Mms ,\nthis implies a < 10% change in velocity for the waves under study. For the strongest wave\n4 this corresponds to a value of \u223c 30 km s\u22121 . As the error in velocity is of the same order\nof \u223c 10% (\u223c \u00b130 km s\u22121 for wave 4), such weak deceleration is hidden in the measurement\nuncertainties. Finally, we note a clear correlation between the lags between successive waves,\ninterpreted as the build-up times of the magnetic energy for the following wave event, and\nthe intensity I/I0 , density N/N0 , magnetosonic Mach number Mms , and the propagation\nvelocities vc of waves 2 to 4 (cf. Fig. 5, bottom).\nIn our study of the homologous wave events it was possible to compare the wave pulse\ncharacteristics and analyze correlations between the wave parameters, knowing that the\nfour large-scale waves propagate in similar coronal conditions. This means that any found\ncorrelation is independent from the indeterminated but constant coronal conditions. Our\nresults provide strong support that the observed large-scale coronal waves are indeed fastmode magnetosonic waves, and additionally suggest a dependence of the wave parameters\nupon the build-up time of the magnetic energy.\nI.W.K., A.M.V., and N.M. acknowledge the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P20867N16.
