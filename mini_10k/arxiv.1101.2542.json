A conformal mapping technique is a powerful mathematical tool to study these phenomena, as demonstrated\nhere, using the Aharonov-Bohm effect in graphene rings with Corbino geometry as an example.\nKeywords: Graphene, Dirac equation, pseudodiffusive transport, minimal conductivity, Aharonov - Bohm\neffect, conformal mapping\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGraphene, a recently discovered two-dimensional allotrope of carbon, is a subject of a hot scientific interest (for\nreview, see Refs. 1\u20137). One of the most unusual features of this new material is a peculiar character of electron energy\nspectrum: the charge carriers in graphene are chiral quasiparticles described by a two-dimensional analog of massless\nDirac equation with effective \"velocity of light\" of order of 106 ms\u22121 , that is, three hundreds times smaller than for\nreal massless particles8,9 . This opens a way to study quantum relativistic effects, which were unreachable in high\nenergy physics, by condensed matter experiments. As an example, it is worth to mention the theoretical prediction10\nand experimental observation11,12 of the Klein tunneling in graphene.\nAnother amazing property of graphene is the finite minimal conductivity which is of the order of the conductance\nquantum e2 /h per valley per spin8,9 . Numerous considerations of the conductivity of a two-dimensional massless Dirac\nfermion gas do give this value of the minimal conductivity with the accuracy of some factor of order of unity13\u201323 .\nIt is really surprising that in the case of massless two-dimensional Dirac fermions there is a finite conductivity\nfor an ideal crystal, that is, without any scattering processes15,21\u201323 . This was first noticed in Ref. 15 using a\nquite complicated formalism of conformal field theory (see also a more detailed and complete discussion in Ref. 23).\nAfter a discovery of the minimal conductivity in graphene8,9 I was pushed by my colleagues experimentalists to\ngive a more transparent physical explanation of this fact which has been done in Ref. 21, based on the concept of\nZitterbewegung24 and on the Landauer formula25,26 . The latter approach has been immediately developed further and\nused to calculate the shot noise22 which turns out to be similar to that in strongly disordered metals (a \"pseudodiffusive\ntransport\"). There are now more theoretical27\u201331 and experimental32,33 works studying this regime in a context\nof graphene. This situation is very special. For conventional electron gas in semiconductors, in the absence of\ndisorder, the states with definite energy (eigenstates of the Hamiltonian) can be simultaneously the states with\ndefinite current (eigenstates of the current operator) and it is the disorder that results in non-conservation of the\ncurrent and finite conductivity. Contrary, for the Dirac fermions the current operator does not commute with the\nHamiltonian (\"Zitterbewegung\") which can be considered as a kind of intrinsic disorder21,34 . Therefore, more detailed\nunderstanding of the pseudodiffusive transport in graphene is not only important for physics of graphene devices but\nalso has a great general interest for quantum statistical physics and physical kinetics.\nII.\n\nZITTERBEWEGUNG AS AN INTRINSIC DISORDER\n\nThe Zitterbewegung is a quantum relativistic phenomenon which was first discussed by Schr\u00f6dinger as early as\nin 193024. Only very recently, it was observed experimentally for trapped ions35 . This phenomenon seems to be\nimportant to understand qualitatively peculiarities of electron transport in graphene at small doping21,34 . Other\naspects of the Zitterbewegung in graphene physics, in particular, possibilities of its direct experimental observation,\nare discussed in Refs.36\u201338 . Here we will explain this basic concept for the case of two-dimensional massless Dirac\nfermions.\nWe start with the Hamiltonian\nX\nH=v\n\u03a8\u2020p \u03c3p\u03a8p\n(1)\np\n\n\f2\nand the corresponding expression for the current operator\nX\nX\nj = ev\n\u03a8\u2020p \u03c3\u03a8p =\njp\np\n\n(2)\n\np\n\nwhere v is the electron velocity, \u03c3 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y ) are Pauli matrices, p is the momentum, and \u03a8\u2020p =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c8p1\n, \u03c8p2\n\n\u0011\n\npseudospinor electron operators. The expression (2) follows from Eq.(1) and the gauge invariance which requires\njp =\n\n\u03b4H\n.\n\u03b4p\n\nare\n39\n\n(3)\n\nHere we omit spin and valley indices (so, keeping in mind applications to graphene, the results for the conductivity\nshould be multiplied by 4 due to two spin projections and two conical points per Brillouin zone). Straightforward\ncalculations give for the time evolution of the electron operators \u03a8(t) = exp (iHt)\u03a8 exp (\u2212iHt) (~ = 1):\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0015\n1 \u2212i\u01ebp t\np\u03c3\np\u03c3\ni\u01ebp t\n\u03a8p (t) =\n1+\n1\u2212\ne\n+e\n\u03a8p\n(4)\n2\np\np\nand for the current operator\nj (t) = j0 (t) + j1 (t) + j\u20201 (t)\nX\np (p\u03c3)\nj0 (t) = ev\n\u03a8\u2020p\n\u03a8p\np2\np\n\u0014\n\u0015\np (p\u03c3)\ni\nev X \u2020\n+\n\u03c3\n\u00d7\np\n\u03a8p e2i\u01ebp t\n\u03a8p \u03c3 \u2212\nj1 (t) =\n2 p\np2\np\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01ebp = vp is the particle energy. The last line in Eq.(5) corresponds to the Zitterbewegung.\nIts physical interpretation is usually given in terms of Landau-Peierls generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple40,41 . Attempts to measure the coordinate of a relativistic particle with a very high accuracy requires the\nenergy which is sufficient to create particle-antiparticle pairs and, thus, we will inevitably loose our initial particle,\nbeing not able to distinguish it from one of the created ones (according to quantum statistics, all microparticles are\nequivalent). This pair creation corresponds to the oscillating terms with the frequency 2\u01ebp in Eq.(5).\nIn terms of condensed matter physics, the Zitterbewegung is nothing but a special kind of inter-band transitions\nwith\n\u221a\ncreation of virtual electron-hole pairs. The unitary transformation generated by the operator Up = 1/ 2(1 + imp \u03c3),\nwhere mp = (cos \u03c6p , \u2212 sin \u03c6p ) and \u03c6p is the polar angle of the vector p, diagonalizes the Hamiltonian and thus\nintroduces electron and hole states with the energies \u00b1vp; after this transformation the oscillating term in Eq.(5)\ncorresponds obviously to the inter-band transitions, e.g.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212 cos \u03c6p\n\u2212i sin \u03c6p e\u2212i\u03c6p +2i\u01ebp t\n\u2020 x\nUp jp Up = ev\n.\n(6)\ni sin \u03c6p ei\u03c6p \u22122i\u01ebp t\ncos \u03c6p\nTo calculate the conductivity \u03c3 (\u03c9) one can try first to use the Kubo formula42 which reads for two-dimensional\nisotropic case:\n1\n\u03c3 (\u03c9) =\n2A\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndte\n\ni\u03c9t\n\nZ\u03b2\n0\n\n0\n\nd\u03bb hj (t \u2212 i\u03bb) ji\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = T \u22121 is the inverse temperature, A is the sample area. In the static limit \u03c9 = 0 taking into account Onsager\nrelations and analyticity of the correlators hj (z) ji for \u2212\u03b2 < Imz \u2264 0 one has42\n\u03b2\n\u03c3=\n4A\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndt hj (t) ji .\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nUsually, for ideal crystals, the current operator commutes with the Hamiltonian and thus j (t) does not depend on\ntime. In that case, due to Eq.(7) the frequency-dependent conductivity contains only the Drude peak\n\u03c3D (\u03c9) =\n\nj2\n\u03c0\nlim\n\u03b4 (\u03c9)\n2A T \u21920 T\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nEither the spectral weight of the Drude peak is finite and, thus, the static conductivity is infinite, or it is equal to\nzero. It is easy to check that for the system under consideration the spectral weight of the Drude peak is proportional\nto the modulus of the chemical potential |\u03bc| and thus vanishes at zero doping (\u03bc = 0). It is the Zitterbewegung, i.e.\nthe oscillating term j1 (t) which is responsible for nontrivial behavior of the conductivity for zero temperature and\nzero chemical potential. A straightforward calculation gives a formal result\n\u03c3=\n\n\u03c0e2\n2h\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u01eb\u01eb\u03b4 2 (\u01eb)\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\nwhere one delta-function originates from the integration over t in Eq.(8) and the second one - from the derivative\nof the Fermi distribution function appearing at the calculation of the average over product of Fermi-operators. Of\ncourse, the square of the delta function is not a well-defined object and thus Eq.(10) is meaningless before specification\nof the way how one should regularize the delta-functions. After regularization the integral in Eq.(10) is finite, but its\nvalue depends on the regularization procedure (for a detailed discussion of this uncertainty, see Ref. 23).\nAlthough this derivation cannot give us a correct numerical factor, it opens a new way to a qualitative understanding\nof more complicated situations. For example, the minimal conductivity of order of e2 /h per channel has been observed\nexperimentally also for the bilayer graphene43 with the energy spectrum drastically different from that for the singlelayer case. The bilayer graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor with parabolic touching of the electron and hole bands\ndescribed by the single-particle Hamiltonian43,44\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\n(px \u2212 ipy )2 /2m\nHp =\n(11)\n2\n(px + ipy ) /2m\n0\n(here we ignore some complications due to large-scale hopping processes which are important for a very narrow range\nof the Fermi energies44 ). The Hamiltonian (11) can be diagonalized by the unitary transformation Up with the\nreplacement \u03c6p \u2192 2\u03c6p . Thus, the current operator after the transformation takes the form (6) with the replacement\nv \u2192 p/m, e\u2212i\u03c6p \u2192 e\u22122i\u03c6p . In contrast with the single-layer case, the density of electron states for the Hamiltonian\n(11) is finite at zero energy but the square of the current is, vice versa, linear in energy. As a result, we have the same\nestimate (10).\nThe Zitterbewegung processes play an important role when deriving quantum kinetic equation for electrons in\ngraphene taking into account a static disorder34 . For undoped case \u03bc = 0 the electron and hole states are degenerate\nin energy, and interband (Zitterbewegung) scattering processes are similar, in a sense, to spin-flip scattering processes\nin the Kondo problem45 . As was shown in Ref. 34 for a particular case of short-range scatterers, the Zitterbewegung\nprocesses lead to corrections to the static conductivity which are logarithmically divergent, and an exponentially small\nenergy scale similar to the Kondo temperature arises\n\u01ebK = \u01ebc e\u2212\u03c0\u03c3B\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u01ebc the a cutoff energy of order of a bandwidth and \u03c3B is the conventional Boltzmann conductivity in the units\nof e2 /h. Earlier this energy scale appeared in nonlinear sigma model approach to the conductivity of two-dimensional\nDirac fermions13,14 . This makes the classical Boltzmann equation inapplicable for a very small doping where |\u03bc| < \u01ebK .\nIII.\n\nLANDAUER FORMULA APPROACH\n\nA deeper understanding of the origin of finite conductivity without charge carriers can be reached using Landauer\nformula approach25 . Following Ref. 21 we consider the simplest possible geometry, choosing the sample as a ring of\nlength Ly in y direction; we will use Landauer formula to calculate the conductance in x direction (see Fig. 1). As\nwe will see, the conductivity turns out to be dependent on the shape of the sample. To have a final transparency\nwe should keep Lx finite. On the other hand, periodic boundary conditions in y direction are nonphysical and we\nhave to choose Ly as large as possible to weaken their effects. Thus, for two-dimensional situation one should choose\nLx \u226a Ly . In Ref. 22 the boundary conditions has been chosen in two different ways, with metallic armchair edges,\nand with infinite gap opening at the edges. The results for the conductivity in the limit Lx \u226a Ly turned out to be\nindependent on the boundary conditions.\nIn the coordinate representation the Dirac equation at zero energy takes the form\n(Kx + iKy )\u03c81 = 0\n(Kx \u2212 iKy )\u03c82 = 0\n\n(13)\n\n\f4\n\nx\nLy\n\n\u03c8t(x)\n\nLx\n\u03c8b(x)\n\ny\n\nFIG. 1: Geometry of the sample. Thick arrow shows the direction of current. \u03c8t (solid line) and \u03c8b (dashed line) are wave\nfunctions of the edge states localized near the top and the bottom of the sample, correspondingly.\n\u2202\nwhere Ki = \u2212i \u2202x\n. General solutions of these equations are just arbitrary analytical (or complex conjugated analytical)\ni\nfunctions:\n\n\u03c81 = \u03c81 (x + iy) ,\n\u03c82 = \u03c82 (x \u2212 iy) .\n\n(14)\n\nDue to periodicity in y direction both wave functions should be proportional to exp (iky y) where ky = 2\u03c0n/Ly , n =\n0, \u00b11, \u00b12, .... This means that the dependence on x is also fixed: the wave functions are proportional to\nexp (\u00b12\u03c0nx/Ly ) . They correspond to the states localized near the bottom and top of the sample (see Fig. 1).\nTo use the Landauer formula, we should introduce boundary conditions at the sample edges (x = 0 and x = Lx ).\nTo be specific, let us assume that the leads are made of doped graphene with the potential V0 < 0 and the Fermi\nenergy EF = vkF = \u2212V0 . The wave functions in the leads are supposed to have the same y-dependence, that is,\n\u03c81,2 (x, y) = \u03c8t,b (x) exp (iky y) . Thus, one can try the solution of the Dirac equation in the following form:\n\uf8f1 ik x\nx<0\n\uf8f2 e x + re\u2212ikx x ,\naeky x ,\n0 < x < Lx\n\u03c8t (x) =\n\uf8f3\nteikx x ,\nx > Lx\n\uf8f1 ik x+i\u03c6\n\u2212ikx x\u2212i\u03c6\nx\n\u2212 re\n,\nx<0\n\uf8f2e\n(15)\nbe\u2212ky x ,\n0 < x < Lx\n\u03c8b (x) =\n\uf8f3\nteikx x+i\u03c6 ,\nx > Lx\n\nwhere sin \u03c6 = ky /kF , kx =\ntransmission coefficient\n\nq\nkF2 \u2212 ky2 . From the conditions of continuity of the wave functions, one can find the\n2\n\nTn = |t (ky )| =\n\ncos2 \u03c6\n.\ncosh (ky Lx ) \u2212 sin2 \u03c6\n2\n\n(16)\n\nFurther, one should assume that kF Lx \u226b 1 and put \u03c6 \u2243 0 in Eq.(16), so,\nTn =\n\n1\ncosh2 (ky Lx )\n\n(17)\n\nThe conductance G (per spin per valley)25 and Fano factor of the shot noise26 F are expressed via the transmission\ncoefficients (17) as\n\u221e\ne2 X\nTn ,\nh n=\u2212\u221e\nP\u221e\nTn2\nF = 1 \u2212 Pn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e Tn\n\nG =\n\n(18)\n\n\f5\nNote that in the ballistic regime where transmission probability for a given channel is either one or zero, F = 0 (the\ncurrent is noiseless) whereas if all Tn \u226a 1 (e.g., current through tunnel junctions) F \u2248 1.\nThus, the trace of the transmission coefficient which is just the conductance (in units of e2 /h) is\nT rT =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\nLy\n.\n\u2243\n\u03c0L\ncosh (ky Lx )\nx\nn=\u2212\u221e\n2\n\n(19)\n\nL\n\nAssuming that the conductance is equal to \u03c3 Lyx one finds the contribution to the conductivity equal to e2 /(\u03c0h)21,22 .\nNote also that for the case of nanotubes (Lx \u226b Ly ) one has a conductance e2 /h per channel, in accordance with\nknown results46,47 .\nFor the Fano factor one has F = 1/3 (Ref. 22). This result is very far from the ballistic regime and coincides\nwith that for strongly disordered metals48,49 . This means that, in a sense, the Zitterbewegung works as an intrinsic\ndisorder.\nA similar approach has been applied also to the case of bilayer graphene50\u201352 . It results in the conductivity and\nFano factor of the same order as those for the single layer. However, in contrast with the latter case where the results\nare robust, for the bilayer numerical factors are dependent on the order or limits (chemical potential to zero, ratio of\nthe contact layer thickness to the sample size, etc.)50,51 , and are sensitive to the trigonal warping52 , small deviations\nfrom parabolic electron spectrum in the bilayer graphene44 .\nIV.\n\nCONFORMAL MAPPING\n\nThus, electron transport in undoped graphene is due to zero modes of the Dirac operator which are represented by\nanalytic functions of z = x + iy determined by boundary conditions. For the geometry shown in Fig. 1 these functions\nare just exponents:\n\u03c81n (z) = exp (2\u03c0nz/Ly )\nso, a generic wave function inside the graphene flake can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\u03c0nz/L \u0013\n\u221e\nX\ny\n0\ne\n\u22c6\n+ bn\n\u03a8(x, y) \u2261\nan\n0\ne2\u03c0nz /Ly\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the coefficients an , bn are determined by the boundary conditions. Let the Fermi wavelength in the leads much\nsmaller than geometric sizes of the flake. Then, for the most of modes one can write the boundary conditions assuming\nnormal incidence, \u03c6 = 0:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1+r\n\u03c8in \u2261\n1\u2212r\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\n(22)\n\u03c8out \u2261\nt\nwhere subscripts \"in\" and \"out\" label the values of the wave functions at the boundaries between the leads and the\nsample. In this approximation it is very easy to solve the problem of electron transport through graphene quantum\ndot of arbitrary shape using a conformal mapping of this shape to the stripe28,29 . For example, the mapping\nw(z) = R1 e2\u03c0iz/Ly\n\n(23)\n\nwith e2\u03c0Ly /Lx = R2 /R1 transforms the rectangular stripe Lx \u00d7 Ly into the circular ring with inner and outer radii\nR1 and R2 , respectively. Instead of Eq.(21) one can try in this case the solutions as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\n0\nz\n(24)\n+ bn\n\u03a8(x, y) \u2261\nan\n(z \u22c6 )n\n0\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nThe conformal mapping allows us to find immediately the solution for Corbino geometry where in and out leads are\nattached to inner and outer edges of the ring, respectively. Moreover, the solution of the problem for any shape of\nthe flake topologically equivalent of the ring can be written automatically in terms of the corresponding conformal\nmapping29 . Earlier28 this method was applied to the case of graphene quantum dots with thin leads attached.\nFollowing Ref. 31 we will present in the next section the results for the Corbino geometry in a more general case, in\nthe presence of magnetic fields.\n\n\f6\nV.\n\nAHARONOV-BOHM EFFECT IN UNDOPED GRAPHENE\n\nThe Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect53,54 is the shift of interference patterns from different electron trajectories by the\nmagnetic flux through the area between the trajectories. This leads to oscillations of observable quantities such as\nconductance as a function of the magnetic flux. The AB effect in graphene has been studied already theoretically55\u201357\nand experimentally58,59 for the case of a finite doping. It is not clear a priori whether this effect is observable or not\nin undoped graphene where the transport is determined by evanescent waves. The analysis31 shows that, whereas for\nthe case of very thin rings the AB oscillations are exponentially small, for a reasonable ratio of radii, such as, R2 /R1\n=5, the effect is quite observable.\nCombining the conformal mapping technique with a general consideration of zero-energy states for massless Dirac\nfermions60 one can derive simple and general rigorous formulas for any graphene flake topologically equivalent to the\nring, avoiding both numerical simulations and explicit solutions of Shr\u00f6dinger equation for some particular cases.\nNote that for the case of circular ring and constant magnetic field the problem can be solved exactly for any doping61\nbut, of course, the mathematics required is much more cumbersome. In the corresponding limits, the results are, of\ncourse, the same.\nFor the case of zero energy E = 0 (undoped graphene) the Dirac equation\n\u03c3 (\u2212i\u2207\u2212A) \u03c8 = E\u03c8\n\n(25)\n\nfor the two-component spinor \u03c8, A is the vector potential and we use the units ~ = e = 1, splits into two independent\nequations for the components \u03c8\u03c3 (\u03c3 = \u00b1):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212i\n(26)\n+\u03c3\n\u2212 Ax \u2212 i\u03c3Ay \u03c8\u03c3 = 0\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\nWe will use the gauge \u2207A = 0 and introduce scalar magnetic potential \u03c6 by\nAx =\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n, Ay = \u2212 ,\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\n(27)\n\nthus,\n\u22072 \u03c6 = \u2212B\n\n(28)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic induction. The vector potential can be eliminated by a substitution60\n\u03c8\u03c3 = e\u03c3\u03c6 \u03c7\u03c3 ,\n\n(29)\n\nEq.(26) being satisfied for an arbitrary analytic function \u03c7+ (z) and complex conjugated analytic function \u03c7 (z) . The\nlatter can be found from boundary conditions as described in the previous section. Thus, the boundary conditions\nfollowing from Eq.(22) are\n(1)\n\n1 + r = \u03c8+\n\n(1)\n\n1 \u2212 r = \u03c8\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nt = \u03c8+\n\n(2)\n\nt = \u03c8\u2212\n\n(30)\n\nwhere superscripts 1 and 2 label the boundaries attached to the corresponding leads.\nIf the boundary of the sample is simply connected one can always choose \u03c6 = 0 at the boundary and, thus, the\nmagnetic field disappears from Eq.(30); this fact was used in Ref. 30 as a very elegant way to prove that a random\nvector potential does not change the value of minimal conductivity. Further we will consider a sample with a topology\nof the ring where the scalar potential \u03c6 is still constant at each boundary but these constants, \u03c61 and \u03c62 are different.\nAlso, by symmetry,\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c7+ /\u03c7+ = \u03c7\u2212 /\u03c7\u2212\n\n(31)\n\n2\n\nThe answer for the transmission coefficient T = |t| has the form:\nTj =\n\n1\ncosh2 [2 (j + a) ln \u039b]\n\n(32)\n\n\f7\nwhere j = \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, ... labels zero modes of the Dirac equation, \u039b is determined by a conformal transformation of\nour flake to the rectangle and\na=\n\n\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61\n2 ln \u039b\n\n(33)\n\nwhich generalizes the corresponding result of Ref. 29 on the case of finite magnetic fields.\nFor simplicity, we will consider further the case of the Corbino disc with inner radius R1 and outer radius R2 ,\nwhen29\np\n\u039b = R2 /R1\n(34)\n\nThe conductance G (per spin per valley) and Fano factor of the shot noise F are expressed via the transmission\ncoefficients (32) via Eq.(18). To calculate the sums one can use the Poisson summation formula\n\u221e\nX\n\nf (n + x) =\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nexp [\u22122i\u03c0kx] fek\n\n(35)\n\nwhere n, k are all integers and fek is the Fourier transform of the function f (x) . Substituting Eq.(32) into (18) one\nfinds a compact and general answer for the effect of magnetic field on the transport characteristics:\n#\n\"\n\u221e\nX\ne2\nk\nG=\n(36)\n1+2\n(\u22121) cos (2\u03c0ka) \u03b1k\nh ln \u039b\nk=1\n\nF =1\u2212\nwhere\n\n\uf8ee\n\n2\uf8f0\n3\n\n1+2\n\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\u0010\nk\n\u03c0 2 k2\n1\n+\n(\u22121)\ncos\n(2\u03c0ka)\n\u03b1\n2\nk\nk=1\n4 ln \u039b\n\uf8fb\nP\u221e\nk\n1 + 2 k=1 (\u22121) cos (2\u03c0ka) \u03b1k\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u03b1k =\n\n\u03c0 2 k/2 ln \u039b\nsinh (\u03c0 2 k/2 ln \u039b)\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\nEquation (28) can be solved explicitly for radially symmetric distributions of the magnetic field B (r):\n\u03a6\nln\n\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 =\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nR2\nR1\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\nZR2\n\nR1\n\ndr\nr\n\nZr\n\ndr\u2032 r\u2032 B (r\u2032 )\n\n(39)\n\nR1\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the magnetic flux through the inner ring. In the case of AB effect where all magnetic flux is concentrated\nwithin the inner ring one has\na=\n\ne\u03a6\n2\u03c0~c\n\n(40)\n\nwhere we have restored world constants.\nDue to the large factor \u03c0 2 in the argument of sinh in Eq.(38) only the terms with k = 1 should be kept in Eqs.(36)\nand (37) for all realistic shapes, thus,\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\ne\u03a6\n\u03c02\n4\u03c0 2\ncos\n(41)\nexp \u2212\nG = G0 1 \u2212\nln (R2 /R1 )\nln (R2 /R1 )\n~c\nF =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n\u03c02\ne\u03a6\n8\u03c0 4\nexp\n\u2212\ncos\n+\n3 3 ln3 (R2 /R1 )\nln (R2 /R1 )\n~c\n\n(42)\n\n2e2\nh ln(R2 /R1 )\n\n(43)\n\nwhere\nG0 =\n\n\f8\nis the conductance of the ring without magnetic field29 .\nOscillating contributions to G and F are exponentially small for very thin rings but, for sure, measurable if the\nring is thick enough. For R2 /R1 = 5 their amplitudes are 5.3% and 40%, respectively.\nConsider now a generic case with the magnetic field B = 0 within the flake. Then, the solution of Eq.(28) is a\nharmonic function, that is, real or imaginary part by an analytic function. It can be obtained from the solution for the\ndisc by the same conformal transformation which determines the function \u039b. One can see immediately that Eq.(40)\nremains the same.

It is really\ncounterintuitive that in such a situation, at zero temperature, it has a finite conductivity, of order of the conductance\nquantum e2 /h. This is one of the most striking consequences of its peculiar \"ultrarelativistic\" energy spectrum. More\nprecisely, this is the consequence of chirality of electron states. In the case of bilayer43 the electron energy spectrum\nis parabolic but the states are chiral, with the Berry phase 2\u03c0, and this leads to the finite minimal conductivity50\u201352\nas discussed above.\nFormally, the electron transport in undoped graphene is determined by zero modes of the Dirac operator which are\ndescribed by analytic functions with proper boundary conditions. Therefore, the whole power of complex calculus\ncan be used here, as well as in classical old-fashionable branches of mathematical physics such as two-dimensional\nhydrodynamics or electrostatics. These states cannot correspond to the waves propagating through the sample but,\nrather, are represented by evanescent waves. The transport via evanescent waves in undoped graphene is a completely\nnew variety of electron transport in solids, drastically different from all types known before (ballistic transport\nin nanowires and constrictions, diffusive transport in dirty metals, variable-range-hopping transport in Anderson\ninsulators, etc.). Deeper understanding of this new quantum phenomena seems to be a very important problem.\nThe work is financially supported by Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie (FOM), the Netherlands.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\nA.
