Therefore, the\nVlasov equation, i.e. the collisionless limit of the Boltzmann equation, describes the dynamics we are interested\nin (see e.g. [1, 17] for details). This is for instance what\npure N-body cosmological simulations attempt to solve.\nAt large scales, where orbit crossing is insignificant, the\nVlasov equation reduces to the dynamics a pressureless\nperfect fluid.\nAlthough the problem is well posed, its resolution beyond the linear regime is still largely an open question.\nSome ideas have been developed in the literature (see\ne.g. [1] and references therein) but to make predictions\nbeyond the linear regime for the density power spectrum,\nthe standard approach in the literature has been to resort\nto semi-analytic prescriptions obtained by fitting to numerical simulations. These fitting formulae, e.g. [16, 23],\noriginate either from the near universal transform advocated in [8] or are based on an even more empirical\nconstruction, the halo model [2].\n\nThese prescriptions however offer predictions for the\npower spectrum with relatively low accuracy, at the level\nof 5-10%, and are insecure in cases of non standard cosmological models. With the advent of precision observations of the large-scale structure, in particular in the\ncontext of the search for dark energy signatures in the\ngrowth of structure, this is clearly insufficient [10]. It\nthen becomes crucial to build reliable, and well controlled, prescriptions for describing the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum and higher order correlation\nfunctions such as the bispectrum. For the latter there is\nnot much published work on the expected behavior beyond tree order, although fitting formulae analogous to\nthe power spectrum case have been proposed [9, 15, 22].\nRecently, a promising new approach to fitting measurements of statistics in N-body simulations and interpolating to other cosmologies has been developed in [7].\nWith the Renormalized Perturbation Theory (hereafter RPT) formalism introduced in [5], a new approach\nemerged for the construction of perturbation schemes\napplicable to such observables. It has been successfully applied to the two-point propagator [4], and to\nthe density power spectrum in the weakly non-linear\nregime [6]. These results show in particular how the\nacoustic peaks are affected by the mode-coupling effects\nin the growth of structure. This reformulation of the\ngravitational perturbation theory also finds alternative\napproaches [11, 13, 14, 25, 26], which give further insights into resummation schemes introduced by RPT.\n\n\f2\nThe aim of this article is to show that some of the core\nresults that have been originally discovered for the twopoint propagator in [4] can also be obtained in the case\nof multi-point propagators, thus extending exact known\nresults regarding the evolution of cosmic gravitational\ninstability.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. We first succinctly recall the general formalism and the results that\nhave already been obtained at the two-point level [4],\ninvolving the cross-correlation between fields at the initial and final conditions. As shown in previous studies,\nthe behavior of this correlator at large-k is of crucial importance and provides us with solid ground for the expansion of the correlation functions of interest [6]. We\nthen show that the three-point propagator, namely the\ncross-correlation between the final density field and two\nof the initial modes, can also be computed explicitly in\nthe high-k limit. This quantity reflects how the final\ndensity is sensitive to the two mode-mode couplings. We\nthen extend this result to propagators of arbitrary number of points. This is the central result of this paper.\nTo contrast our results with numerical simulations, we\nextend the method developed in [4] to measure multipoint propagators. This allows us to compute the threepoint propagator in numerical simulations against our\npredictions in the large-k regime. We finally comment\non the relevance of these results for the construction of\npower spectrum and bispectrum resummation schemes,\nand provide a first application to the case of the bispectrum.\n\nII.\n\n\u2202s \u03a8a (k, s) + \u03a9ab \u03a8b (k, s) =\n\u03b3abc (k, k1 , k2 ) \u03a8b (k1 , s) \u03a8c (k2 , s), (3)\nwhere\n\u03a9ab \u2261\n\n\"\n\n#\n0\n\u22121\n,\n\u22123/2 1/2\n\n(4)\n\nand the symmetrized vertex matrix \u03b3abc describes the non\nlinear interactions between different Fourier modes and\nis given by\n|k1 + k2 |2 (k1 * k2 )\n,\n2k12 k22\n(k1 + k2 ) * k1\n\u03b3121 (k, k1 , k2 ) = \u03b4D (k \u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 )\n, (5)\n2k12\n\n\u03b3222 (k, k1 , k2 ) = \u03b4D (k \u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 )\n\n\u03b3112 (k, k1 , k2 ) = \u03b3121 (k, k2 , k1 ), and \u03b3 = 0 otherwise;\nwith \u03b4D denoting the Dirac delta distribution.

Consistently with this limit one can assume the fluid to be\nirrotational and thus fully described by \u03b4 and the velocity divergence, \u03b8 \u2261 \u2207 * v.

The time variable s is defined from the scale factor\nby\ns \u2261 ln a(\u03c4 ),\n\nthe scales we are interested in to a very good approximation by replacing a(\u03c4 ) by the linear growth factor of the\ncosmology under consideration [1].\nThe equations of motion then read (we henceforth use\nthe convention that repeated Fourier arguments are integrated over),\n\n(2)\n\nand corresponds to the number of e-folds of expansion.\nWe will first consider a cosmology with \u03a9m = 1 and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.

At each initial point and each vertex\npoint there is a sum over the component indices; a sum over\nthe incoming wave modes is also implicit and, finally, the time\ncoordinate of the vertex points is integrated from s = 0 to the\nfinal time s according to the time ordering of each diagram.\nFor instance, at fourth order there are two different possible\ntopologies.\n\nwhere F (n) are fully symmetric functions of the wavevectors that can be obtained recursively in terms of gab\nand \u03b3abc [1]. Note that these functions have a non-trivial\ntime dependence because they also include sub-leading\nterms in es .

(6) can be used to construct a diagrammatic representation of the fields \u03a8(n) . As an illustration, we show in Fig. 1 diagrams corresponding to the\nlocal field expansion up to fourth order.\nA detailed description of the procedure to draw the\ndiagrams and compute their values can be found in [5],\nwe can briefly summarize these rules here as follows. In\nFig. 1 the open circles represent the initial conditions\n\u03c6b (k), where b = 1 (b = 2) corresponds to the density\n(velocity divergence) field, and the line emerging from it\ncarries a wavenumber k. Lines are time-oriented (with\ntime direction represented by an arrow) and have different indices at both ends, say a and b. Each line represents\nlinear evolution described by the propagator gab (sf \u2212 si )\nfrom time si to time sf . Each nonlinear interaction between modes is represented by a vertex, which due to\n\nquadratic nonlinearities in the equations of motion is the\nconvergence point of necessarily two incoming lines, with\nwavenumber say q1 and q2 , and one outgoing line with\nwavenumber q = q1 + q2 . Each vertex in a diagram\nthen represents the matrix \u03b3abc (q, q1 , q2 ). It is further\nunderstood in Fig. 1 that internal indices are summed\nover and interaction times are integrated out in the full\ninterval [0, s].\nNote that at the level of the field \u03a8, all diagrams are\ntree diagrams with no loops. This is unlike in standard\nfield theories, and is due to the lack of \"antiparticles\"\n(both in the strict sense of the word, like in quantum field\ntheory, and at the quasiparticle level, as e.g. holes in condensed matter systems). However, loop diagrams appear\nonce we calculate statistical averages such as correlators\nbetween fields. Other unusual properties compared to\nstandard field theories are the non-trivial k-dependence\nof vertices (see also [18]) and last, but not least, a strong\nbreaking of time-translation invariance. In fact, the theory is unstable with perturbations growing as a function\nof time from their initial conditions (represented by density and velocity fields after decoupling).\nHaving written the final conditions of interest \u03a8 in\nterms of initial conditions \u03c6, to build diagrammatic representations for statistical quantities such as the nonlinear propagator or the power spectrum, one needs to\nspecify the statistical properties of the initial conditions.\nHere we will assume Gaussian initial conditions, in which\ncase the statistical properties are encoded in the initial\nspectrum of fluctuations,\n\u03c6a (q)\u03c6b (q\u2032 ) = \u03b4D (q + q\u2032 )Pab (q).\n\n(12)\n\nwith Pab = ua ub P0 for growing-mode initial conditions,\ni.e. if Eq. (8) is satisfied. Ensemble averages are therefore obtained by gluing together the open circles in the\ndiagrams by pairs (according to the calculation rules for\nGaussian fields) to form a symbol \u2297, which will appear in\nall diagrams in the figures below. This symbol represents\nthe initial power spectrum Pab (q), when the outgoing\nlines away from the initial conditions have respectively\nindices a and b and carry wavenumbers q and q\u2032 . Finally,\nin all diagrams it is understood that internal wavenumbers (corresponding to loops) when such symbols appear\nare integrated over.\n\nIII.\n\nMULTI-POINT PROPAGATORS\nA.\n\nThe Two-Point Propagator\n\nThe idea at the heart of RPT is to realize that the diagrammatic series described above for correlation functions can be partially resummed. This amounts to generalizing the operator gab , encoding the linear evolution,\nto a fully nonlinear one, denoted by Gab , that effectively\ndescribes time evolution when coupling between modes is\npresent. This generalized operator, called the nonlinear\n\n\f4\npropagator, is formally defined as,\n\u03b4\u03a8a (k, s)\n= \u03b4D (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) Gab (k, s).\n\u03b4\u03c6b (k\u2032 )\n\n(13)\n\nThis quantity basically measures how linear is the transition from initial to final fields. Note that, although\ncertainly \u03a8a (k) depends on \u03c6b (k\u2032 ) for k\u2032 6= k, translation invariance demands that the expectation value of the\nderivative in Eq. (13) is only non-zero if k = k\u2032 [27].\nDue to nonlinear evolution, one expects Gab to decay\nto zero at small scales where non-linear effects become\nimportant and make \u03a8(k) very different from a linear\ntransformation of \u03c6b (k). In fact, for Gaussian initial conditions it is possible to give an alternative expression for\nGab , as a cross-correlation between final \u03a8a and initial\n\u03c6b fields [4],\n\u03a8a (k, s) \u03c6b (k\u2032 ) = Gac (k, s) \u03c6c (k) \u03c6b (k\u2032 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThis equivalence gives rise to the alternative name of\ntwo-point propagator and reinforces the idea that decorrelation of fields \u03a8a with respect to \u03c6b mandates that Gab\nmust vanish at small scales. Indeed, it was shown in [4]\nthat Gab can be computed in the large-k limit and it follows a Gaussian decay with k. This was also checked in\nnumerical simulations (see Fig. 4 and discussion in sec. IV\nbelow). At low-k, on the other hand, linear theory is recovered and Gab (k \u2192 0) = gab , as expected.\nIntroducing the concept of a two-point propagator\nhelps to understand nonlinear corrections to the power\nspectrum. The power spectrum can be written as [5]\nP (k, \u03c4 ) = G2 (k, \u03c4 ) P0 (k) + PMC (k, \u03c4 ),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere we have explicitly included the time dependence,\nP0 is the initial density power spectrum, and PMC is\nthe mode-coupling power spectrum. Note that what\nwe call G in this equation is the density propagator\nG \u2261 G11 + G12 = G1b ub , since we assume growing-mode\ninitial conditions; a completely equivalent equation holds\nfor velocities. The first term describes all the contributions to P (k) that are proportional to the initial power\nspectrum at the same scale k, while the second, denotes\nthe contribution to P (k) from modes other than k in\nthe initial spectrum (hence called \"mode-coupling\"), i.e.\nPMC (k) is nonzero even if P0 vanishes at wavenumber k\n(as long as P0 is not zero everywhere).\nThe first term in Eq. (15) has the most direct information of the initial power spectrum, since it is proportional\nto P0 at the same scale, thus varying k one can probe\nP0 (k) as long as the first term is dominant, i.e. at large\nscales where G has not yet decayed significantly. The\ntwo-point propagator G can be given an alternative interpretation by noting that Eq. (14) says that (G/D+ )2 ,\nwhere D+ is the linear growth factor, is the fraction of\nthe power that grows by linear theory at a given k. As G\ndecays, a given mode looses memory about its primordial\n\n(linear) value, and an important fraction of the power is\ncontributed by nonlinear effects alone, i.e. PMC . However, that does not mean that information on the initial\npower spectrum is completely lost at such scales. In fact,\nRPT gives a precise expression for PMC in terms of convolutions over the initial spectrum (see Fig. 5 in [6] for how\nwell this works when compared to simulations). However the information on P0 contained in PMC is rather\ncrude, since PMC (k) depends on nonlinear combinations\nof P0 (q)'s from a wide range of scales q weighted by complicated convolution kernels.\nAs we will show in the rest of the paper, these kernels\nare the (square of) multi-point propagators and, in fact,\nthey also determine the tree-level higher-order spectra\n(bispectrum, trispectrum, etc). Therefore, multi-point\npropagators will lead us to a different way of writing the\nmode-coupling contributions to P (k) (and higher-order\nspectra), and a direct physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the power spectrum at small scales\nand higher-order correlations at large scales.\nB.\n\nDefinition of Multi-Point Propagators\n\nHaving discussed the importance of the two-point\npropagator let us introduce the concept of multi-point\npropagators, denoted \u0393(p) , as a natural extension of the\ndefinition in Eq. (13),\n1\n\u03b4 2 \u03a8a (k, s)\n(2)\n= \u03b4D (k \u2212 k12 ) \u0393abc (k1 , k2 , s) (16)\n2 \u03b4\u03c6b (k1 )\u03b4\u03c6c (k2 )\nfor the three-point case and,\n\u03b4 p \u03a8a (k, s)\n1\np! \u03b4\u03c6b1 (k1 ) . . . \u03b4\u03c6bp (kp )\n\n=\n(p)\n\n\u03b4D (k \u2212 k1...p ) \u0393ab1 ...bp (k1 , . . . , kp , s) ,(17)\nwhere k1...p = k1 + . . . + kp , for an arbitrary number of\npoints. Note that \u0393(p) denotes the (p + 1)-point propagator, by translation invariance it depends only on p\nwavenumbers in Fourier space.\nThe question we want to address in this section is the\ncalculation of \u0393(p) . We will shortly show that exact results can indeed be obtained for \u0393(p) in the large k limit.\nThis is a nontrivial generalization of the two-point case\nand constitutes a core result in this paper. In addition, as\nanticipated above, we will show in section VII that correlation functions can be reconstructed solely in terms of \u0393\nfunctions and initial power spectra P0 , e.g. for the power\nspectrum we will show that,\nP (k) =\n\nX\nr\u22651\n\nr!\n\nZ\n\nh\ni2\n\u03b4D (k \u2212 q1...r ) \u0393(r) (q1 , . . . , qr )\n\n\u00d7 P0 (q1 ) . . . P0 (qr ) d3 q1 . . . d3 qr ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u0393(1) is the two-point propagator G used in Eq. (15)\nand the mode-coupling spectrum PMC is described here\n\n\f5\nby the terms with r \u2265 2. Equation (18) is something\nalready found in [5] within the Zel'dovich approximation,\nbut extended here to the exact dynamics.\nFormally, the \u0393 functions can be computed order by order in a field expansion and thus they can be represented\ndiagrammatically. Examples of such diagrams are shown\nin Fig. 2. To lowest order it can be easily shown from\nEqs. (9,10,17) that \u0393(p) coincides with the F (p) kernels in\nEq. (10). Diagramatically this lowest order corresponds\nto a tree level diagram. Let us explicitly compute \u0393(2)\nstarting from the second diagram in Fig. 1 and the rules\ndescribed in Sec. II to get an expression for \u03a8(2) , that\nafter the functional derivatives in Eq. (17) gives,\nZ s\n(2)\n\u0393abc,tree (k1 , k2 , s) =\nds\u2032 gad (s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3def (k1 , k2 , k)\n\n\u0393\n\n(n)\n\n(k,p1,...,pn)=\np1\n\nk\n\np1\nk\n\n=\npn\n\np1\n+\n\nk\n\n+...\n\npn\n\npn\n\u00d7\n\nFIG. 2: Representation of the first two terms of the multipoint propagator \u0393(n) in a perturbative expansion. \u0393(n) represents the average value of the emerging nonlinear mode k\ngiven n initial modes in the linear regime.

The fastest growing term in\nEq. (20) is precisely the F2 kernel in standard PT.\nWe now show that the equivalence in Eq. (14) between\ntwo-point propagators and cross-correlations for Gaussian initial conditions, can be extended to multi-point\npropagators. Let us start with the three-point propagator \u0393(2) .\n(2)\nOn the one hand, an expression for \u0393abc (k1 , k2 ) can\nbe formally written in terms of the functions F (n) using\nEqs. (10,16).

This relation is very useful since it provides a simple way to compute the threepoint propagator in numerical simulations out of crosscorrelations between final and initial conditions (see Section VI).\nAs expected, the relations in Eqs.

THE LARGE-k BEHAVIOR OF\nMULTI-POINT PROPAGATORS\nA.\n\nThe Large-k Limit of the Two-Point Propagator\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the two-point\npropagator Gab generalizes gab beyond linear theory and\nthus reflects a key property of the evolved fields. The\ngeneral properties of Gab have been explored in detail\nin [4], but we briefly recall them here to motivate their\ngeneralization to multi-point propagators.\nFollowing Eqs. (9,10), and the definition in Eq. (13),\none can expand the function Gab with respect to the am-\n\n\f6\n\nGab(k) =\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk1\n\n\u0393(3)abcd(k1, k2, k3) =\n\nk\n\nk2\n\nk3\n\nFIG. 4: The large-k limit of the two-point density propagator\n\u0393(1) . Symbols correspond to measurements in numerical simulations at redshifts z = 1, 0.5 and z = 0 (top to bottom), see\ntext for details. The solid lines correspond to the large-k limit\nexpression given in Eq. (25). The linear relation obtained by\nplotting log G vs. k2 makes evident that the suppression of G\nis indeed Gaussian in the high-k limit. Moreover, the slope is\nvery well predicted by Eqs. (25,26).\n\nplitude of initial fluctuations,\nGab (k, sf , si ) = gab (sf \u2212 si ) + G1loop\n(k, sf , si ) + . . . (24)\nab\nwhere G1loop\n(k, sf , si ) is the first nonlinear correction\nab\nterm, describing the transition into the nonlinear regime.\nGraphically, this term corresponds to a \"one-loop\" diagram (i.e. an integral over P0 ), which is shown in Fig. 3.\nAs nonlinear effects become important Gab is expected\nto decay to zero since they erase the one-to-one correspondence of modes valid in the linear regime. This introduces a characteristic scale that describes the decay\nlength of the two-point propagator. It was shown in [4]\nthat this decay can be computed exactly in the high-k\nlimit, where a subset of diagrams is expected to provide\nthe dominant contribution. Following a line of calculation that we will use again shortly, it was shown that in\nthe large-k limit,\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nk\nGab (k, sf , si ) = exp \u2212 \u03c3v2 (esf \u2212 esi )2 gab (sf \u2212 si ),\n2\n(25)\nwhere the characteristic decay length is determined by\nthe rms velocity fluctuations\n\u03c3v2\n\n1\n=\n3\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd3 k\nP0 (k).\nk2\n\n(26)\n\nFIG. 5: Example of diagrams contributing to Gab (k) (top)\n(3)\nand \u0393abcd (k, k1 , k2 , k3 ) (bottom). The dominant contribution after resumming all possible configurations is expected\nto come from those diagrams where all loops are directly connected to the principal line (top) or principal tree (bottom).\nThe principal line and tree are drawn with a thick solid line.\nThe dominant loops are those drawn by dashed lines, while\nthe sub-dominant loops are those in dotted lines.\n\nIn [4], it is shown how to match this result valid for\nk\u03c3v \u226b 1 to the low-k behavior described by Eq. (24), to\nobtain a prescription for its full time and k dependence.\nThis prescription was found to be in good agreement with\nnumerical simulations at all scales and different redshifts\nfor density and velocity divergence propagators.\nHere, we concentrate on the large-k behavior of the\ndensity propagator from growing-mode initial conditions,\n(1)\n\u0393(1) \u2261 \u03931b ub = G11 + G12 (we will henceforth use both\n(1)\nG and \u0393 to refer to the two-point propagator). We use\nthe algorithm presented in [4] to measure \u0393(1) based on\nthe cross-correlation property in Eq. (14). We defer a description of the simulations used here until section VI below. Figure 4 shows \u0393(1) normalized by the linear growth\n(1)\nfactor \u0393tree = g11 + g12 , with gab the linear propagator\ndefined in Eq. (7); the unusual notation for the growth\nfactor is used here to emphasize that it is given by the\ntree-contributions to the two-point propagator, this will\nhave a natural generalization for multi-point propagators. The figure shows log \u0393(1) vs. log k 2 to emphasize\nthe Gaussian decay very well predicted by Eq. (25) at all\nredshifts with characteristic scale given by Eq. (26).\nIn the following sections we investigate similar properties, regimes and measurements to those carried out with\nGab , to the case of the three-point propagator \u0393(2) and,\nwhen possible, extend this to \u0393(n) .\n\nB.\n\nDominant diagrams and principal trees\n\nTo study the high-k regime of the propagators, the first\nstep is to identify the set of diagrams that is expected\nto dominate the large-k behavior. This identification is\nclosely linked to the concept of principal line and its gen-\n\n\f7\n\nk1\n(1)\n(3)\nk3\n(2)\nk2\n\nFIG. 6: Dominant loop contributions for the three-point prop(2)\nagator \u0393abc (k1 , k2 , k3 ). The final expression is obtained by\nthe sum of an infinite number of such loops and over all possible interaction times. In the large-k limit these terms can\nbe computed exactly.\n\neralization, the principal tree, that all the diagrams for\npropagators contain. These concepts are illustrated in\nthe diagrams appearing in Fig. 5. For instance, in the\ntop diagram there is a unique way to go from initial time\n(symbolized by the vertical dotted line) to the final time\nwithout crossing a \u2297, thus moving always in the direction\nof increasing time. It's easy to check that this is true for\nany diagram contributing to Gab . This is what we call\nits principal line.\nSimilarly there exists a unique tree, the principal tree,\nthat joins the initial time to the final time in the bottom\ndiagram of Fig. 5. The number of branches of this tree\nis equal to the number of points minus one for the propagator under consideration (i.e. the number of function\nderivatives in the definition in Eq. (17)). Again, it's easy\nto check that the existence of a principal tree is general\nand does not depend on the number of loops that are attached to it, although at a given order different diagrams\nmay have different principal trees (see bottom diagrams\nof Fig. 1). Principal trees appear then as simple generalization of the concept of principal line initially introduced\nin [4].\nWe now note that in the expansion series, all diagrams\ncan be seen as a principal tree with loops attached to its\nbranches. Following arguments developed in [4], we claim\nthat the general behavior of the multi-point propagators\nare dominated in the large-k limit by those diagrams in\nwhich every loop is directly connected to the principal\ntree.\nThis idea follows from the fact that multi-point propagators are a measure of the correlation between final\nand initial configurations, see Eqs. (14,22,23). And diagrams that contain only such loops are more effective in\nthe process of correlating the final field with the initial\nconditions (that is, the modes running along the principal\ntree always interact with growing modes coming from the\ninitial conditions). In particular, this argument remains\nvalid at large-k where these diagrams can be computed\nexactly, as we will show in subsequent sections.\nAs explicit examples, we show in the bottom diagram\nof Fig. 5 in dashed lines the kind of loops that con-\n\ntribute dominantly to the large-k limit of \u0393(3) (while the\nprincipal tree is represented by solid lines and the subdominant loops in dotted lines) . In Fig. 6 we show some\nof the dominant loop contributions to \u0393(2) , as they are\nthe subject of next section.\nThese examples can be used to build a simple picture\nof the different loop contributions. Let us take the case\nof the two-point propagator. Its one-loop contribution\nis shown in Fig. 3. As shown in [4], this contribution is\ndominated by loop momenta of order q \u2243 \u03c3v\u22121 , thus is\nin the high-k limit (k\u03c3v \u226b 1), most of the momentum\nis flowing along the principal line of the diagram. Now\nconsider the two and higher loop contributions: the dominant loops, when resummed, give Eq. (25), again saying\nthat all dominant loops have momenta of order q \u2243 \u03c3v\u22121\nflowing in them; this is a consequence of the form of the\nvertices and the shape of the CDM spectrum.\nAs far as the subdominant loops are concerned, there\nare two cases at the two-loop level: with one leg in the\nprincipal line (e.g. as the dotted loop in the top half\nof the Gab diagram in Fig. 5), and with no legs in the\nprincipal line (e.g. as the dotted loop in the bottom\nhalf of the Gab diagram in Fig. 5). In fact, there are\ntwo types of diagrams of the latter type, depending on\nwhether the two legs of the loop land are on the same side\nof \u2297 (as in Fig. 5), or not. The first case corresponds to\nrenormalizing the internal propagator, the second to a\nrenormalization of the initial power spectrum. However,\nsince both renormalizations must be evaluated at large\u22121\nscales, i.e. q <\n\u223c \u03c3v , their effect on the final result must be\nsubdominant. The subdominant loops with one leg in the\nprincipal line corresponds to renormalizing the vertex,\nand the level of agreement seen in Fig. 4 suggests that\nsuch vertex renormalizations are small. This corresponds\nto studying the three-point propagator in the limit where\n\u22121\none incoming momentum is \"soft\" (of order q <\n\u223c \u03c3v )\nwhile the other is large. While we are not able to resum\nthis case, we shall see that when the whole principal tree\nis in the high-k limit, the behavior of the three-point\npropagator can be established.\n\nC.\n\nThe Large-k Limit of the Three-Point\nPropagator\n\nThe aim of this section is to obtain the large-k limit of\nthe three-point propagator \u0393(2) defined in Eq. (16). To\nthis end we need to sum over the whole set of dominant\nloop diagrams,\n(2)\n\n\u0393abc =\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\n\u0393abc,\n\nn\u2212loops ,\n\n(27)\n\nn\u22650\n\nthat is, only consider those diagrams with loops directly\nattached to the principal tree, see Fig. 6. Note that to do\nthe summation in Eq. (27) one needs to take into account\nthe symmetry factors of each contribution [28]. Let us\nstart by considering the one-loop case in detail first, since\n\n\f8\nFig. 6 - each carrying respectively the wave vectors k1 ,\nk2 and k3 . In the calculation of those diagrams one has\nto sum over all indices, describing density and velocity\ndivergence perturbations (we implicitly assume that such\nindices when repeated are summed over). As an example,\nwe write down the corresponding integral when the loop\nis connected to branches 3 and 1,\n\nit will allow an easy extrapolation when accounting for\narbitrary number of loops in the large-k limit.\nDiagrams are computed according to the rules given in\nsection II, but let us be a bit more precise in the notation.\nIn Fig. 6, each of the contributing loops carries a wave\nvector q such that q \u2243 \u03c3v\u22121 \u226a k1 and similarly q \u226a k2 .\nIt is connected to two segments (not necessarily distinct)\ntaken in the set of three - denoted (1), (2) and (3) in\n\n(2)\n\u0393abc,{13} (k3 , k1 , k2 ; s)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nP0 (q) d q\n\nZ\n\ns\n\nds1\n\ns\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ns\n\nds\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\ns\u2032\n\n0\n\nds2 gad (s \u2212 s1 ) \u03b3def (k3 , q, k3 \u2212 q) es1 ue gf h (s1 \u2212 s\u2032 )\n\n\u00d7\u03b3hij (k3 \u2212 q, k1 \u2212 q, k2 ) gik (s\u2032 \u2212 s2 ) \u03b3klm (k1 \u2212 q, \u2212q, k1 ) es2 ul gmb (s2 ) gjc (s\u2032 )\n\nwhere s1 , s2 are the interaction times where the loop legs\nattach to the principal tree, and s\u2032 is the interaction time\nbelonging to the principal tree. Furthermore, we assumed\ngrowing mode initial conditions, so the initial spectrum\nPab reduces to ua ub P0 , see Eq. (12), and gab (s)ub = es ua .\nIt is crucial to note that, as for the calculation of Gab ,\nin the high-k limit the vertex matrix takes the form [4],\n\n\u03b3abc (ki , q, ki \u2212 q)ub \u2248\n\nki .q\n\u03b4ac ,\n2 q2\n\n(29)\n\nwhen contracted with an incident growing mode (such\nas those coming from the initial conditions). The interaction then leaves the modes along the principal tree\nlines unchanged and carrying the wave vector ki (since\n\n(28)\n\nki + q \u2248 ki ) all along. As we now show, applying this\nlarge-k limit to Eq. (28) simplifies calculations greatly.\nLet us be general now and consider a loop that joins\nthe segment (i) and (j). Again, we denote the interaction times for such a loop as s1 and s2 . The loop\ncontribution will eventually be given by the integration\nof these times over the time range of the corresponding\nsegments. The integral over the segment (i) can be defined through the respective characteristic functions Ii ,\nwith I1 (t) = I2 (t) = \u0398(t)\u0398(s\u2032 \u2212 t) for interactions after\nthe initial conditions but before the vertex of the principal tree (at time s\u2032 ) and I3 (t) = \u0398(t \u2212 s\u2032 )\u0398(s \u2212 t)\nfor interactions after s\u2032 and before the time of interest s\n(s \u2265 s\u2032 \u2265 0).\n\nThe one-loop contribution is then given by\nZ s\nZ\nZ\n(2)\n\u0393abc,{ij} = \u2212sij\nds\u2032 gad (s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3def (k1 , k2 , k3 )geb (s\u2032 )gf c (s\u2032 ) ds1 Ii (s1 ) ds2 Ij (s2 )\nZ 0\nki .q kj .q s1 +s2\n,\ne\n\u00d7 d2 \u03a9q q 2 dq P0 (q)\n2 q2 2 q2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere sij is the symmetry factor associated to this contribution. It is 4 if i 6= j (e.g. 2 for each incoming line), and\nit is only 2 for i = j because the time ordering of s1 and s2 is ignored in Eq. (30) [29].

The time integration over s1 and s2 can be\ndone easily for each loop diagram characterized by {ij} = {11}, {22}, {33}, {12}, {13}, {23}.

As we shall see it amounts to exponentiate the one-loop result above. There are at least two ways\nto obtain such a result. The most direct method, which\nwe follow here, consists in computing simultaneously an\narbitrary number of loops. The cumbersome part in this\ncase is to find out the combinatorial weights for each diagram. Here we follow the one-loop strategy discussed\nabove and ignore time ordering at first and correct for\nthe overcounting afterwards. In Appendix A we provide\nan alternative derivation of this method that takes into\naccount time ordering explicitly. A second method based\non a different resummation scheme is presented in Appendix B.\n\n(2)\n\u0393abc,{pij }\n\nThe lesson we must recall from the one-loop calculation\nis the following. Every loop must be directly connected to\ntwo \"principal\" segments (i) and (j) of the principal tree\n(i and j go from 1 to 3, see Fig. 6). Time integration\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthen leads to (es \u2212 1) if i = 1 or 2, and (es \u2212 es ) if\ni = 3, and similarly for j. Momentum integration leads to\n\u2212\u03c3v2 ki *kj /4, and in addition there is an overall symmetry\nfactor sij (with sij = 4 if j 6= i and 2 otherwise).\nThe loop resummation in Eq. (27) relies on a proper\ncounting of each of the diagrams that contribute in the\nlarge-k limit. In turn, each of these diagrams can be\ndefined by a set of parameters, pij , where each counts\nthe number of lines connecting the segments (i) and (j)\n(i \u2264 j). For instance, the diagram in Fig. 6 corresponds\nto p11 = 1, p22 = 0, p12 = 1, p13 = 1, p23 = 0 and\np33 = 1. Each loop line connects to the principal tree\nat time si . Dropping the time ordering in si (within\neach of the principal lines), the contribution from such\nan ensemble of loops is given by,\n\n\u0012\n\u0013Pi\u2264j pij Y\nZ s\nY\ns{pij }\n\u03c3v2\npij\n2pii\n(ki .kj )\nds\u2032 gad (s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3def (k1 , k2 , k3 )geb (s\u2032 )gf c (s\u2032 )\nki\n\u2212\n=\nM{pij }\n4\n0\ni<j\ni\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u00112p11 +2p22 +2p12 +p13 +p23 \u0010\n\u2032 2p33 +p13 +p23\n.\n(34)\nes \u2212 es\n\u00d7 es \u2212 1\n\nIn this expression the coefficient s{pij } is the symmetry\nfactor associated with each set of pij . For a given ordered\ntopology, each loop introduces a factor 4, so that\ns{pij } = 22\n\nP\n\ni\u2264j\n\npij\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nThe coefficient M{pij } on the other hand represents the\nnumber of times each given diagram has been computed\nbecause the time ordering has been dropped. Changing\nthe time order (within each principal line) allows to automatically scan the different topologies (diagrams sharing\nthe same set of pij ) but computing them several times.\nThe symmetry factor pij in M{pij } is precisely here to\n\ncorrect for this multiplicity factor. It is relatively easy to\nsee that its dependence on each pij factorizes, so that\nM{pij } =\n\nY\ni\u2264j\n\nM(pij )\n\n(36)\n\nwhere M(pii ) = 2pii pii !, and M(pij ) = pij ! if i 6= j (there\nis an extra factor of 2 when i = j to compensate for the\nabsence of time ordering. See Fig. 7 for illustration of\nthese symmetry factor countings). The summation over\npij is then straightforward and leads to exponentiations,\n\n\f(2)\n\n)\n(1\n\n(1\n\np12= 3\n\n)\n\n10\n\n(2)\n\np11= 3\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nFIG. 7: This figure illustrates the effect of the time ordering exchanges (thick double arrow lines).\nThrough such exchanges, the complete set of diagrams that correspond to a given {pij } can be explored. Successive time\nexchanges can however lead to identical diagrams (e.g. left and right diagrams in each panel). The unordered time integration\nthen leads to a multiplicity factor for each diagram. For the top panel (corresponding to p12 = 3), the same diagram is obtained\neach time two loop lines are exchanged. There are p12 ! of such possible exchanges. For the bottom panel (corresponding to\np11 = 3), the same diagram can be obtained either by the exchange of loop lines, or by the exchange of the end and final time\nof each loop of them (double arrow dashed line). There are thus p11 ! 2p11 of such possible exchanges.\n\n(2)\n\u0393abc\n\n=\n\nX\n\n{pij }\n\n(2)\n\u0393abc,{pij }\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ns\n\nds\u2032 gad (s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3dbc (k1 , k2 , k3 )gdb (s\u2032 )gdc (s\u2032 )\n\n\u001a\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0001\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\n\u03c3 2 \u0010 s\u2032\n\u00d7 exp \u2212 v\nk32\nes \u2212 1 (k1 .k3 + k2 .k3 ) + es \u2212 es\ne \u22121\nk12 + 2k1 .k2 + k22 + 2 es \u2212 ss\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c32 k2\n(2)\n2\n\u0393abc,tree ,\n(37)\n= exp \u2212 v 3 (es \u2212 1)\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u0393abc,tree defined in Eq. (19). This is a truly remarkable result. It shows that the whole effect of loop\nsummation is encoded in the value of k3 in exactly the\nsame way as for the two-point propagator Gab .\nWe now compare this result to measurements in numerical simulations, which will be described in detail\nin section VI. As done for the two-point propagator\n(see Fig. 4), we test for the Gaussian decay in the\nhigh-k limit by plotting in Fig. 8 equilateral configura(2)\ntions log \u03931 (k, k, k) vs k 2 , for which Eq. (37) predicts a\nstraight line with known slope. We do so for three different redshifts z = 0, 0.5, 1, finding very good agreement in\nall cases with the predictions of Eq. (37), shown in solid\nlines. This validates our resummation scheme.\nEquation (37) and its generalization to other multipoint propagators have important implications for the\npower spectrum and higher-order statistics, that we discuss in section VII. We note also that a second, faster,\nmethod to perform the loop resummation is discussed\nin appendix B. We now consider the extension of these\nresults to arbitrary multi-point propagators.\n\nD.\n\nThe Large-k Limit for Higher-Order\nMulti-Point Propagators\n\nThe structure we found for the three-point propagator\n\u0393(2) is appealing enough to consider its full generalization\nto propagators of arbitrary number of points. The crucial\nproperty is the extension of the one-loop relation given\nin Eq. (33). For higher than three-point propagators, the\ntree-order is given by the sum of several diagrams. When\nloop corrections are taken into account, the principal tree\nof each of these diagrams is naturally the corresponding\ntree-order diagram. For instance, there are two of such\ndiagrams for \u0393(4) shown in Fig. 1.\n(p)\n\nLet us define \u0393(q),tree , the tree-order contribution to\n\u0393(p) from diagram of type (q). The value of such a diagram is obtained after the integration over the s1 . . . sp\u22121\ntime variables corresponding to the interaction points is\ndone. Generically it can be written as,\n(p)\n\u0393(q),tree\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ns\n\nds1 . . .\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ns\n\ndsp\u22121 T (q) (k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 ,\n, s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 ) (38)\n\n\f11\nwhere T (q) (k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 , s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 ) denotes the value\nof the diagram (q) before the time integrations are performed. T depends on the vertices and the linear propagators, the arguments of which impose time-ordering\nthrough gab (\u03b7) = 0 for \u03b7 < 0.\n\nFIG. 8: The large-k limit of the three-point density propa(2)\n(2)\ngator \u03931 \u2261 \u03931bc ub uc , the only density contraction that can\nbe measured for growing mode initial conditions, ub = (1, 1).\nThe symbols in the figure correspond to equilateral configurations at redshifts z = 1, 0.5, 0 (from top to bottom). We\n(2)\nhave normalized these measurements to its low-k limit \u03931,tree\ngiven by Eq. (20). The figure clearly shows that the measured\npropagator closely follows the large-k limit given by Eq. (37)\n(2)\nrepresented by solid lines, once \u03931 decays by \u2248 e\u22121 from its\ntree-level value.\n\n(p)\n\nThe one-loop diagrams built out of the\n(q)\u2212tree diagram involve the same core function\nT (q) (k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 , s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 ). A one-loop diagram\njoining the segments (i) and (j) is then given by\n\nZ s\nZ\n\u2212\u03c3v2 s\ndsp\u22121 T (q) (k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 , s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 ) C{ij} (k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 , s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 )\nds1 . . .\n2\n0\n0\nsij\n\u2261\n(ki * kj ) (esi,2 \u2212 esi,1 ) (esj,2 \u2212 esj,1 )\n2\n\n\u0393(q),{ij} =\n\n(39)\n\nC{ij}\n\n(40)\n\nwhere si,1 and si,2 are respectively the starting and ending time of segment (i) of the principal tree which carries\nmomentum ki . Thus the times sk,l belong to the set\n{s1 , . . . , sp\u22121 }. This is already the result of integrating\nover the additional two time variables that correspond to\nthe two extra interactions due to the loop (see the step\nin going from Eq. (31) to Eq. (32), for example).\nFrom these results it can then be shown that the sum\nover (i, j) of C{ij} is |k1 + * * * + kp\u22121 |2 (es \u2212 1)2 . The\nproof can be obtained recursively as a simple successive\napplication of the result found for \u0393(2) . This mechanism\nis illustrated in Fig. 9.

(19), and small scales (high-k\nlimit), we now discuss what happens in between. This\ncan be achieved by computing the next to leading order\ncorrection in an series expansion in terms of initial fields,\ni.e. p = 1 in Eq. (21).

(40). The contributions involving the wave\nvectors ki , kj and their sum is singled out. The first three diagrams correspond to the one-loop contribution involving an extra wave vector, k\u2032 (dashed line). By the high-k summation rules described before Eq. (34), they sum to\nk\u2032 * [(ki + kj )(es2 \u2212 es1 ) + ki (es1 \u2212 1) + kj (es1 \u2212 1)] (es2 \u2212 1) = k\u2032 * (ki + kj )(es2 \u2212 1)2 . The next three and last three diagrams correspond to \"internal\" loops (i.e. loops attached to the principal lines with momenta ki , kj and their sum). As\nshown for the computation of \u0393(2) , these six diagrams sum to |ki + kj |2 (es2 \u2212 1)2 . By the summation rules, these two results\ncan be expressed by two contributions to C(ij) with one less branch, as shown by the two diagrams in the last line. The same\nprocedure can be applied recursively until the expression of C(ij) reduces to that coming from a single branch, leading to the\nfinal expression.\n\nto calculating the one-loop diagrams from Fig. 6, according to the rules given in section II. There are six types\nof such diagrams, depending on where each of the loop\nlines is attached to in the principal tree. Depending on\nthis, they can be labelled as {33}, {11}, {22}, {12}, {13},\nand {23}. Each of these cases is depicted in Fig. 6.\nIn Eq. (28) we wrote down explicitly the one-loop inte(2)\ngral expression for \u0393abc,{13} . A similar procedure can be\nfollowed to obtain expressions for the rest of the one-loop\ncontributions. The difficulty in their actual computation\nresides in the integration over loop momenta. The angular integrations are independent of P0 (k) and can be\ndone analytically. Such integrations involve two sets of\nfunctions, one built out of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n\u03c0 log (k1 + q)2\n2\nd \u03a9q\n(43)\n=\n|k1 + q|2\nk1 q (k1 \u2212 q)2\nand the other built out of,\nZ\n1\n=\nd2 \u03a9q\n2\n|k1 + q| |k2 \u2212 q|2\n\u03c0 log (W+ /W\u2212 )\np\n2\n2\nk3 q k1 k2 + q 4 + q 2 (k32 \u2212 k12 \u2212 k22 )\n\n(44)\n\nwith,\n\nW\u00b1 \u2261 \u00b12(k12 \u2212 q 2 )(k22 \u2212 q 2 ) \u00b1 4k32 q 2 + 4k3 q\nq\n\u00d7 k12 k22 + q 4 + q 2 (k32 \u2212 k12 \u2212 k22 )\n\n(45)\n\nand k3 = |k1 +k2 |. The explicit expression of the final result for arbitrary dependence on configuration (k1 , k2 , k3 )\nis too long to reproduce here. However, we have checked\n(2)\nthat \u0393abc,1loop (k1 , k2 , q) follows the expected large-k\nlimit. In the low-k limit, it is interesting to note that\nafter the angular integration \u0393abc,1loop (k1 , k2 , q) behaves\nas 1/q 2 .\n\n\f13\nThe most growing contribution (i.e. largest power in growth factor) in this limit is,\n\u0014\n4901(k12 + k22 ) 32879k14 + 231478k12k22 + 32879k24\n(2)\n(k1 * k2 )\n+\n\u03931,1loop (k1 , k2 , s) \u223c \u2212\n18865\n226380k12k22\n\u0015\n9552(k12 + k22 )\n12409\n2\n3\n+\n\u03c3v2 a4 (\u03c4 ),\n(k\n*\nk\n)\n+\n(k\n*\nk\n)\n1\n2\n1\n2\n18865 k12k22\n56595 k12k22\n\n(46)\n\nwith \u03c3v2 given in Eq.

As mentioned before, the\n\ncross-correlation property, Eq. (22), allows us to easily\nmeasure the three-point propagator in numerical simulations. In fact, this can be straightforwardly extended to\nother multi-point propagators using Eq. (23).\nIn practice initial conditions in simulations are generally set in the linear growing mode in which case Eq. (22)\nbecomes,\n\n\u03a8a (k)\u03b40 (\u2212k1 )\u03b40 (\u2212k2 )\n\u00d7\n\n= 2 \u03b4D (k \u2212 k1 \u2212 k2 )\n\n\u0393(2)\na (k1 , k2 )P0 (k1 )P0 (k2 ),\n\n(2)\n\n(49)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we used the shorthand notation \u0393a = \u0393abc ub uc\nwith ua = (1, 1) and \u03c6a (k) = ua \u03b40 (k), and the initial\npower spectrum obeys P0 (k)\u03b4D (k+ k\u2032 ) = \u03b40 (k)\u03b40 (k\u2032 ) ).\n(2)\n\nTherefore, \u0393a can be measured by implementing the\n\n\f14\n\nFIG. 10: Momentum dependence of the three-point density\n(2)\npropagator integrand \u03931,1loop (k1 , k2 , q) for different configurations. The solid line denotes equilateral triangles (with\nk1 = k2 = k3 = 1); the short dashed line colinear triangles\n(with k1 = k2 = 0.5, k3 = 1); and the long dashed line triangles with k1 = 0.816, k2 = 0.3, k3 = 1 (in all cases units are in\nh/Mpc). The y-axis has been normalized to the large-k limit\nexpression given in Eq. (33). Notice how this limit is reached\nfor small values of q, as expected.\n\nfollowing algorithm based on Eq.

(50) we have assumed that the three(2)\npoint correlator \u0393a does not depend upon the orientation of the triangle but only on the magnitude of its\nsides, as expected from statistical isotropy. Additionally\none must be aware that the estimator in Eq. (50) is only\nstrictly valid when the initial field \u03b40 is Gaussian (otherwise, one must go back to the definition Eq. (16) and\nimplement the functional derivative, see [4] for such details in the case of the two-point propagator).\nIn this paper we focus on the statistics of the density\n(2)\nfield, and thus we only present measurements of \u03931 . Ob(2)\ntaining \u03932 requires the measurement of the local veloc(2)\nity divergence, while measuring other components of \u0393abc\nrequires numerical simulations with a mixture of growing\nand decaying modes in the initial conditions.\nTo test our theoretical results from sections IV and\n\nV, we use Eq. (50 to measure the three-point propagator in N-body simulations using a set of 50 realizations, with each realization containing Npar = 6403 particles within a cubic volume of side Lbox = 1280h\u22121Mpc.\nThe total comoving volume of our simulations, approximately 105 (h\u22121 Gpc)3 , is large enough to minimize cosmic variance. Cosmological parameters were chosen as\n\u03a9m = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, \u03a9b = 0.046 and h = 0.72. The\ncorresponding initial power spectrum had scalar spectral\nindex ns = 1 and was normalized to yield \u03c38 = 0.9\nwhen linearly evolved to z = 0. The simulations were\nrun using Gadget2 [24] with initial conditions set at\nzi = 49 using 2nd order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory\n(2LPT) [3, 19]. The output times were at z = 1, 0.5, 0.\nAt each output time we measured the two and three-point\npropagators by cross-correlating the density field at the\ndesired time with the initial density field at zi = 49 (as\ndescribed above and in [4]).\nFigure 11 shows the density three-point propagator\n(2)\n\u03931 for equilateral configurations (top left panel for z = 0\nand bottom panels for z = 0.5, 1, as labeled) and colinear\nconfigurations (top right panel, z = 0). In each panel the\nsymbols with error bars correspond to the measurements\nin the N-body simulations, the long dashed line represents the one-loop result from Eqs. (47,48) and the solid\nline the large-k limit from Eq. (37). In all cases the errors\ndisplayed are for the mean of the ensemble obtained from\nthe scatter among the 50 realizations. For simplicity we\nonly show the more familiar configurations, corresponding to colinear and equilateral triangles, although we have\nmeasured all configurations.\nThe comparison in Fig. 11 shows overall that both\nlarge-k and low-k regimes are well modeled by the analytic results for different triangle configurations and redshifts. This establishes a good basis from which a matching ansatz can be constructed to describe also intermediate scales, as done in [4] for the two-point propagator.\nLet us now point out some limitations in the measurements that help understand better the significance of the\nlevel of agreement seen in Fig. 11. The asymptotic limit\nto the tree level value at large scales is difficult to measure\nsince few configurations of a given shape are available at\nlow k, which gives rise to relatively large cosmic variance.\nTo partially mitigate this one is tempted to increase the\nbin size in Fourier space. However, a larger bin size introduces a mixing of triangles of slightly different shape,\n(2)\nwhich have different \u03931 . For equilateral triangles, increasing the bin size introduces slightly off equilateral\ntriangles which bias the result to higher values as we show\nbelow, while the opposite is true for colinear configurations. Therefore a trade-off takes place between reducing\nthe bin size to obtain unbiased results but at the expense\nof increasing the cosmic variance. We choose a bin size\n\u03b4k = 0.005 h Mpc\u22121 = kF (the fundamental mode of the\nsimulation volume) for k . 0.15 h Mpc\u22121 , 2kF that up\nto k . 0.4 h Mpc\u22121 and 4kF for smaller scales where the\nimpact from offset configurations is negligible. This is\nthe reason why the error bars diminish by a factor of\n\n\f15\na few at e.g. k \u223c 0.15h\u22121 Mpc for equilateral triangles.\nFor colinear triangles, the change in binning happens at\nslightly different scales, evident from looking at the top\nright panel in Fig. 11.\nThe bias of the \u0393(2) estimator can be understood and\nquantified using the tree level results as follows. Since\nk3 = k1 + k2 , equilateral triangles have an angle of 120\u25e6\nbetween k1 and k2 . Configurations slightly off this will\ngive a tree level result, from Eq. (20), equal to\n\u221a\n1\n2 5 3\n(2)\n\u25e6\n\u0393\n(k,\nk,\ncos(120\n+\n\u03b4))\n\u2248\n\u2212\n\u03b4,\n(51)\n1,tree\n2\nD+\n7\n14\nwhere 2/7 is the \"exactly\" equilateral value. The offequilateral configurations with larger k3 have more statistical weight (more Fourier modes), and they are represented by negative \u03b4. Therefore a bias towards higher\n(2)\nvalues of \u03931 is introduced by increasing the bin size.\nConversely, the slightly off-colinear configurations would\nbias the measurement below the exactly colinear case because\n11\n1\n(2)\n\u03931,tree (k, k, cos(0\u25e6 + \u03b4)) \u2248 2 \u2212 \u03b4 2 ,\n2\nD+\n14\n\n(52)\n\nresulting in a negative estimator bias.\nThe empty circles in Fig. 11 correspond to the measurements \"corrected\" for the estimator bias assuming that\n(2)\nthe configuration dependence of \u03931 , slightly away from\nthe exactly colinear or equilateral configurations, is given\nby the tree-level expressions above (with \u03b4 \u223c kF /k). For\nequilateral configurations the agreement with the oneloop prediction at intermediate scales is improved, particularly at z = 0.5 and 1. For colinear configurations\nthe correction is negligible.\nThese estimates assume tree-level perturbation theory,\nwhen loop corrections are included the situation is expected to changed somewhat. As it is well known in the\nbispectrum case [21], at low redshift the dependence on\nconfiguration is suppressed, so the estimator bias is expected to be larger at higher redshift where mixing different triangles leads to more bias. This helps explain\nwhy at higher redshift (bottom right panel in Fig. 11),\nthe intermediate scale measurements done with bin size\n2kF are more above the predictions than at low redshift.\n\nFinally, it is easy to show that the size of error bars\n(2)\n\u22121\non \u0393a scales as D+\n, as for the bispectrum [21]. This is\nnicely recovered in Fig. 11 when one compares z = 1, 0.5\nand 0.\n\nVII. APPLICATIONS TO THE POWER\nSPECTRUM AND BISPECTRUM\nA.\n\nReconstructing the Power Spectrum from\nMulti-Point Propagators\n\nWe now discuss the relationship between multi-point\npropagators and nonlinear corrections to the power spectrum, showing that the power spectrum Pab can be reconstructed by gluing together \u0393(p) contributions, as briefly\nmentioned in Eq. (18) above.\nA formal expression for Pab (k) can be written using\nthe expansion in Eq. (9) as,\n\u03b4D (k1 + k2 )Pab (k1 , s) \u2261\n\n\u03a8a (k1 , s)\u03a8b (k2 , s)\nX\n(n )\n=\n\u03a8a(n1 ) (k1 , s)\u03a8b 2 (k2 , s)\nn1 ,n2\n\n(53)\n\nThen, for a given choice of indices n1 and n2 one has to\ncompute the ensemble average of n1 + n2 factors \u03c6(qi ),\nfollowing the field expansion in Eq. (10).\nSince we assume Gaussian initial conditions, this joint\nensemble average is then a sum of various terms, each\nof them the product of two-point correlators (Wick's\ntheorem). Each of these terms can be labelled with\nindices r, s, t, where r is the number of connected pairs\nwithin the first n1 fields \u03c6ci (qi ), s is the number of\nconnected pairs within the last n2 fields \u03c6di (q\u2032i ), and\nt is the number of \"mixed\" pairs connecting fields\nfrom the first n1 and the last n2 . Obviously one\nhas n1 = 2r + t and n2 = 2s + t.

In each panel the long dashed line corresponds\nto the one-loop prediction given in Eqs. (47,48) while the solid line is the high-k limit derived in Eq. (37). At large scales the\nmeasurements reach the tree-level result well known from standard perturbation theory (horizontal short dashed line), given\nby Eq. (20). The empty circles in the panels of equilateral configurations are the measurements after the correction due to the\nestimator bias as described in the text. In addition, the sudden change in the size of error bars as a function of scale is due to\nthe change in binning, see text for details.\n\nwhere we have omitted the time variable \u03b7 for clarity.

The\ncrossed circles represent initial power spectra. The sum runs\nover the number of internal connecting lines, i.e. the number\nof such circles. It is important to note that each term in this\nsum is positive.\n\nin this expression a sum of products of \u0393(t) functions, see Eq.

This sum is diagrammatically represented in\nFig. 12, and corresponds to a contraction of \u0393(n) diagrams when the incoming lines are glued together to\nform initial power spectra. The combinatorial factor t!\nin front of Eq. (56) is the number of ways of contracting\ntwo (t + 1)-point propagators.\nIt is interesting to note that for a = b, the result is\na sum of positive terms. For example, for the density\nspectrum (a = b = 1) up to one-loop corrections we have,\nP (k) = [\u0393(1) (k)]2 P0 (k)\nZ\n+ 2 d3 q [\u0393(2) (k \u2212 q, q)]2 P0 (|k \u2212 q|)P0 (q).\n\n(58)\n\nThis resummation scheme is then very attractive in\npractice, because, unlike standard PT, the subsequent\ncontributions add constructively and correspond to a sum\nover \"bumps\" peaked at increasingly higher k's. We encounter here a similar situation as the one presented in\nthe original formulation of RPT [4, 5], although the resummation scheme differs in detail. For example, here\nit is important to note that we are led to consider an\n\ninfinite number of objects, the n\u2212point propagators, a\nproperty at variance with what a renormalization group\napproach suggests [30]. This is unlike in [4, 5] where\none deals with a few objects, e.g. the two-point propagator and the vertex (in this regard, note that Eq. (56)\nautomatically incorporates vertex renormalization). We\nhave seen though that the multi-point propagators share\ncommon, and useful, properties. In particular, their expression for the high-k limit (k\u03c3v \u226b 1) provide a useful\napproximation to compute multi-loop corrections to the\npower spectrum, i.e. the mode-coupling power spectrum\nin Eq. (15).\nWe finalize this section by noting that the relation in\nEq. (56) can be also obtained by considering an expansion\nof the field \u03a8a in terms of generalized Wiener-Hermite\nfunctionals of the initial fields \u03c6a , see [12]. The multipoint propagators defined in Eq. (17) would then correspond to the kernel coefficients of this expansion. In\n[12] it is also introduced the formal expansion to address\nthe more general case of non Gaussian initial conditions.\nNote however that this approach does not provide a prescription to compute these kernels (e.g. a resummation\nscheme such as the one derived in Sec.IV or in [5] for\n\u0393(2) ).\n\nB.\n\nReconstructing the Bispectrum from\nMulti-Point Propagators\n\nWe now extend these results to the bispectrum.

We see that it runs over the number of lines that connect each\nside of the diagram (with the constraint that at most one of the indices r, s or t is zero, otherwise we would have\na disconnected diagram). The leading order (tree) contribution is then obtained for r = s = 1, t = 0 (plus cyclic\npermutations), up to one-loop corrections (in square brackets) we have\nB(k1 , k2 , k3 ) = 2 \u0393(2) (k1 , k2 ) \u0393(1) (k1 ) \u0393(1) (k2 ) P0 (k1 )P0 (k2 ) + cyc.\nh Z\n+ 8 d3 q \u0393(2) (k1 \u2212 q, q)\u0393(2) (k2 + q, \u2212q)\u0393(2) (q \u2212 k1 , \u2212k2 \u2212 q)P0 (|k1 \u2212 q|)P0 (|k2 + q|)P0 (q)\nZ\ni\n+ 6 d3 q \u0393(3) (\u2212k3 , \u2212k2 + q, \u2212q)\u0393(2) (k2 \u2212 q, q)\u0393(1) (k3 )P0 (|k2 \u2212 q|)P0 (q)P0 (k3 ) + cyc. .\n(60)\nNote that having resummed the multi-point propagators\nmeans that many of the one-loop corrections in standard\nPT are already encoded in \u0393(p) and thus the number of\none-loop diagrams is reduced. For the power spectrum\nwe have one instead of two diagrams, for the bispectrum\nwe have two instead of the four in standard PT [21].\nIt is useful to compare the structure of Eqs. (58)\nand (60). We see that the one-loop corrections to the\npower spectrum depend on the initial power spectrum P0\nthrough a convolution with the three-point propagator\n\u0393(2) , which determines the large-scale (tree-level) bispectrum. The two-loop correction to the power spectrum involves a similar convolution with \u0393(3) , which determines\nthe large-scale trispectrum, and contributes to the oneloop bispectrum. This pattern continues to higher orders, demonstrating that in order to extract the most\n\ninformation about the initial power spectrum P0 , it is\nadvantageous to simultaneously measure the power spectrum and higher-order spectra at large scales and include\nthese relationships when doing cosmological parameter\nestimation.\nAs a preliminary application of these results, we compute the reduced bispectrum Q defined by\nQ=\n\nB(k1 , k2 , k3 )\n,\nP (k1 )P (k2 ) + P (k2 )P (k3 ) + P (k3 )P (k1 )\n\n(61)\n\nwhere we use one-loop results for both the power spectrum and bispectrum from Eq. (58) and Eq. (60), respectively. Since we don't yet have a full prescription for the\nmulti-point propagators valid at all scales, we use their\nhigh-k limit expressions, Eq. (42) modified as follows,\n\n\f19\n\n\u0393(p) =\n\n\u0393(1) (kp )\n(1)\n\n\u0393tree (kp )\n\n(p)\n\n\u0393tree ,\n\n(62)\n\nwhich reduces to Eq. (42) in the high-k limit, and approximately incorporates (through the full scale-dependence\nof the two-point propagator \u0393(1) found in [4]) the fact\nthat at low-k propagators decay slower than their highk limit indicates, as shown in Fig. 11 by comparing the\none-loop to the high-k expressions at low-k.\nFigure 14 shows the result of this calculation (solid\nlines) compared to measurements of the bispectrum in\nour numerical simulations (symbols with error bars). Because we only compute up to one-loop corrections, the\nrange of scales available to test our predictions is limited. At low-k, the deviations from tree-level PT are\nsmall, and error bars increase. At high-k two-loop corrections become important (see e.g. Fig. 3 in [6] for the\ncase of the power spectrum). We concentrate on z = 0\nwhere the deviations from tree-level are largest and the\napplication of standard PT is least successful. The scales\nshown in Fig. 14 are those where the deviations from\ntree-level are largest while we seem to be still within the\nvalidity of the one-loop approximation. We see that the\nlevel of agreement with simulations is very encouraging\ndespite the approximate nature of Eq. (62), correctly describing the loss of dependence of Q on triangle shape.\nMore work is needed to explore the robustness of these\npredictions, but it is clear that the results found in this\npaper on multi-point propagators will be useful for a variety of statistics. A detailed discussion of the bispectrum\nwill be presented elsewhere.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe generalized the notion of two-point propagator to\narbitrary multi-point propagators. We derived the oneloop corrections to the three-point propagator, and were\nable to resum the dominant class of diagrams contributing to multi-point propagators in the large-k limit, extending what was derived before for the two-point propagator in [4]. Our results show that multi-point propagators decay with the same rate as the two-point propagator in the large-k limit and are proportional to their\ntree-level values. We have extended the algorithm presented in [4] to measure the three-point propagator in\nnumerical simulations, and showed that our high-k limit\nresummation agrees well with both two and three-point\npropagators at nonlinear scales.\nFurthermore, we showed that the multi-point propagators can be considered building blocks out of which\none can construct arbitrary n\u2212point spectra. In addition, nonlinear corrections to the power spectrum depend\non the initial spectrum through convolutions with multipoint propagators, which in turn determine the largescale (tree-level) polyspectra. This gives a direct physical\n\nFIG. 14: The reduced bispectrum Q at z = 0 in tree-level\nPT (dashed line), one-loop RPT (solid line) and measured in\nnumerical simulations (symbols with error bars) as a function\nof the angle between k1 and k2 .\n\nconnection between nonlinear corrections to the power\nspectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations at\nlarge scales.\nWe used our results on the resummation of multi-point\npropagators to reconstruct the power spectrum and bispectrum up to one-loop level, and showed that the predictions for the reduced bispectrum agree well with measurements in numerical simulations. This is encouraging\nnews for the calculation of higher-order correlation functions in renormalized perturbation theories.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the French Programme National de Cosmology and by the French\nAgence National de la Recherche under grant BLAN071-212615.

An n-loop diagram is specified by\nthe number of vertices ni (i = 1, 2, 3) along the principal\nlines with momenta ki , i.e. 2n = n1 + n2 + n3 , n1 =\n2p11 + p12 + p13 , n2 = 2p22 + p12 + p23 , n3 = 2p33 +\np13 + p23 , where\npij are defined as in section IV C (note\nP\np\nthat n =\ni\u2264j ij ). Here we start from scratch, i.e.\nto construct such an n-loop diagram we start from the\nprincipal tree, to which we attach ni branches to principal\nlines of momentum ki each with its initial condition (as\nin Fig. 1) and we proceed to take expectation values.\nConsider one of the principal lines at a time, say (3)\ncarrying momentum k3 . There are n3 time-ordered vertices along this line, and its symmetry factor is 2n3 because branching is asymmetric (which leads to Eq. (35)\nwhen all three principal lines are included). Out of these\nn3 branches one must select 2p33 for averaging among\nthemselves (thus making p33 loops), out of the remaining p13 + p23 one must select p13 for averaging with p13\nbranches attached to the principal line (1), thus creating p13 loops, and the remaining p23 average with p23\nbranches attached to (2). The number of ways of doing\nthis is,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nn3\np13 + p23\nn3 !\n=\n(A1)\n2p33\np13\n(2p33 )! p13 ! p23 !\nand the analogous combinatorial factors also apply to the\nother 2 principal lines. The process of taking expectation\nvalues introduces the following factors: (2pii \u2212 1)!! is the\n\n(2)\n\u0393abc,{pij }\n\nnumber of ways of averaging pairs (Gaussian fields) out\nof 2pii initial conditions, while there are pij ! ways of connecting pij branches (i 6= j) coming out of principal lines\n(i) and (j). This leads to the combinatorial factor,\n\n(2p11 \u2212 1)!! (2p22 \u2212 1)!! (2p33 \u2212 1)!! p12 ! p13 ! p23 !\n\nPutting together this with Eq. (A1) and its two permutations for the two other principal lines (and the symmetry\nfactors for each line) we have a total overall factor of\n2n1 +n2 +n3 n1 ! n2 ! n3 !\nQ\n2p11 +p22 +p33 i\u2264j pij !\n\nAPPENDIX B: RESUMMATION IN FOURIER\nSPACE SHELLS\n\nThe results presented in the main part of this paper\nrely on a direct resummation of multiloop contributions.\nIn this appendix we present another method that makes\nuse of the mathematical structure of the loop correction\nterms in the large-k limit. The idea is to partition Fourier\n\n(A3)\n\nFinally the time-ordered integrals give, e.g. for principal\nline (3),\ns\n\ns1\n\nsn3 \u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n(es \u2212 es )n3\n,\nn3 !\ns\u2032\ns\u2032\ns\u2032\n(A4)\nwhere s is the final time and the principal tree splits\nat time s\u2032 . For principal lines (1) and (2) one obtains\nanalogous factors \u2032but with the corresponding time dependences, i.e. (es \u2212 1). Therefore, we see that the ni !\nfactors in Eq. (A3) get cancelled by time-ordering (as expected from the discussion in section IV C, see in particular Fig. 7). Then, after momentum integration, which\ngives \u2212\u03c3v2 ki kj /4 for loops attached to principal lines (i)\nand (j), we can write this equation taking into account\ntime ordering as follows,\nZ\n\nds1 es1\n\nZ\n\nds2 es2 . . .\n\nZ\n\ndsn3 esn3 =\n\n\u0001\nY (\u2212k 2 \u03c3 2 /2)pii Y \u2212ki .kj \u03c3v2 pij Z s\ni v\n=\nds\u2032 gad (s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3def (k1 , k2 , k3 )geb (s\u2032 )gf c (s\u2032 )\np\n!\np\n!\nii\nij\n0\ni\ni<j\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u00112p11 +2p22 +2p12 +p13 +p23 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032 2p33 +p13 +p23\n\u00d7 es \u2212 1\n,\nes \u2212 es\n\nwhich when summed over the pij , and using that k3 =\nk1 +k2 , gives the tree-level value times a Gaussian factor,\ni.e. Eq. (37).\n\n(A2)\n\n(A5)\n\nspace into finite volume elements. Although there is no\nneed to actually specify the partition we will be using, one\nsimple way of constructing an explicit one is to decompose the volume into concentric shells that we will denote\ni, j, . . . , with the i-th shell corresponding to q \u2208 [\u039bi\u22121 , \u039bi ]\nand being of width \u03b4\u039b\nR i . That means that\nPthe integration\nover Fourier modes, dq3 , becomes 4\u03c0 i \u039b2i \u03b4\u039bi assuming that the integrand depends on the norm of q only. Let\nus now explore the loop contributions for the two-point\npropagator Gab in this framework.\nAccording to the results presented in section IV, see\ne.g. Eq. (30), the contribution to the one-loop correction\ncoming from shell i to Gab (k), \u03b4 i Gab (k), reads in the\n\n\f21\nlarge-k limit\n\u03b4 i Gab (k) = gab (k) L(k, \u039bi )\u03b4\u039bi ,\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere we used the following definitions,\n\nI\u22821,...,i\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0k s1 s2\nL(s2 , s1 , k, \u039b) = \u2212\n(B2)\ne e P0 (\u039b)\nZ s3 Z s\nL(k, \u039b) =\nds1\nds2 L(s2 , s1 , k, \u039b)\n0\n\n= \u2212\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0k 2 s\n(e \u2212 1)2 P0 (\u039b).\n3\n\n(B3)\n\nMultiloop corrective terms exhibit then a truly remarkable property. Let us start with a two-loop contribution.\nIn all of these calculations the linear propagator factors\nalong the principal line can be factorized in the large-k\nlimit, due to the property that gab (s\u2212 s\u2032 )gbc (s\u2032 ) = gac (s).\nThus, we simply have for the two-loop contribution to\nGab , \u03b4 i,j Gab ,\n\u03b4 i,j Gab (k) = gab L(k, \u039bi )\u03b4\u039bi L(k, \u039bj )\u03b4\u039bj .\n\n{0, . . . , i \u2212 1} and the subsets of {0, . . . , i} that contains\ni. As a result this sum can be rewritten,\nX\nX\n\u03b4 I Gab (k) =\n\u03b4 I Gab (k)\n\n(B4)\n\nThis factorization property can be generalized to any order. As a result, for a collection of loops whose indices\nare in set I, the multi-loop correction term, \u03b4 I Gab , reads\nY\n\u03b4 I Gab (k) = gab\n[L(k, \u039bi )\u03b4\u039bi ] .\n(B5)\ni\u2208I\n\nWe can then resum all these contributions, e.g. resum\n\u03b4 I Gab for relevant sets I of shell indices. Let us denote\nGab,\u039bi (k) the resummed value of the propagator when\nall contributions of shells up to i have been taken into\naccount, that is, assuming there is a cutoff for wavemode\nq at q = \u039bi .\nThe result is formally given by a sum of terms of the\nform \u03b4 I Gab (k) where the sum runs over all possible subsets I of {1, . . . , i}, e.g.,\nX\n\u03b4 I Gab (k),\n(B6)\nGab,\u039bi =\nI\u2282{1,...,i}\n\nand when the width of each shell is made infinitely small.\nThe subsets of {0, . . . , i} can be split into the subsets of\n\n[1] F.

(25) for the initial condition Gab (k, 0) = gab (k).\nThis procedure can be simply extended to multi-point\n(2)\n(2)\npropagators.

(13) and hence invariance demands k = k\u2032 . A more\npedestrian demonstration is to recall that an arbitrary\nnonlinear contribution to \u03a8(k) of, say, (n + 1)-th order\nin \u03c6 with momenta\nqi is restricted by translation invariP\nance to obey n+1\ni=1 qi = k.

Such\na method aims at transforming discrete sums we have to\ndeal with into a simple first order differential equation,\nthe solution of which can be easily obtained. The two\napproaches are based on the same basic properties of the\nloop terms. We comment more on this in the appendices.\n[29] We are able to compute time integrations ignoring timeordering and correcting for this afterwards because the\nintegrand (es1 +s2 ) is symmetric under exchange of s1 , s2 .\nThat\nis,\nR s for such integrands\nRs\nR s we can take advantage of\nRs\nds2 s\u20322 ds1 = 21 s\u2032 ds2 s\u2032 ds1 . This symmetry arises\ns\u2032\nas a consequence of the simplification of the vertex function in the high-k limit, plus the linear propagator obeying gab (s \u2212 s\u2032 )gbc (s\u2032 ) = gac (s). We will use this useful\nproperty in the summation over loops shortly, as it is\nmore convenient to deal with an arbitrary number of integrals with the same limits.\n[30] In particular, it seems unlikely that one could obtain a\nlocal vertex renormalization, e.g. a renormalization flow\nin which g \u2192 G and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u0303 where the time dependence\nof \u0393 would be only that of the time of interaction. The\nreason is that the results obtained here cannot simply be\nrecap in such a form in the large-k limit. If one wants to\nstick to such a renormalisation procedure, it would mean\nthat the class of diagrams we have been able to resum\nwill not be included.\n\n\f"}
