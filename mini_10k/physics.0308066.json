The earth can be seen as a point object\nin space receiving solar radiation and emitting infra-red radiation back into\nspace.We consider the only important state variable,the mean temperature\nT,with respect to time given by the heat balance equation\ndT\n1\n= (Q(1 \u2212 a(T )) \u2212 \u03b5B \u03c3T 4 )\n(1)\ndt\nC\n\u03c3 ,the Stefan constant \u03b5B , emissivity factor, C, the heat capacity of the\nsystem Q the Solar Constant and a, the albedo,which expresses the part of\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics,JNTU College of Engineering Kukatpally,Hyderabad.\n\n1\n\n\fsolar radiation emitted back into space. The equation (1) admits two steady\nstates Ta ,Tb , Ta , being the present day climate and Tb , the glaciation time.\nA third state T0 is unstable and separates the above two stable states. As is\nwell known,in systems involving only one variable,U the kinetic potential is\ngiven by [2]\nU =\u2212\n\nZ\n\ndxF (x)\n\nIn the present case, the kinetic potential U(T) is given by\n1\nU(T ) = \u2212\nC\n\nZ\n\ndT (Q(1 \u2212 a(T )) \u2212 \u01ebB \u03c3T 4 )\n\n(2)\n\nNow climatic systems like any other physical system are continuously subject\nto statistical fluctuations,the random deviation from deterministic behavior.\nWe include the effect of the fluctuations in a random force F(t).The energy\nbalance equation ,(1),and (2) now become a stochastic differential equation\nof the form\n\u2202U(T )\ndT\n=\u2212\n+ F (T )\ndt\n\u2202T\n\n(3)\n\nThe important new element introduced by this enlarged description is that\ndifferent states become connected through the fluctuation.That is ,starting from some initial state the system will reach any other state,sooner or\nlater.This is true for the stable states Ta and Tb ,taken as initial states,which\nbecome some sort of meta-stable states.\nThe time scale of this phenomenon is determined by two factors:the potential\nbarrier\n\u2206Ua,b = U(T0 ) \u2212 U(Ta,b )\nand the strength of the fluctuations as measured by the variance ,q 2 of F(t)in\n(3).\nThe mean transition time from state Ta or Tb via the unstable state T0 is\ngiven by [1]\nTa,b \u223c e\n\n\u2206Ua,b\nq2\n\n(4)\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Model\n\nWe will now model the above situation in terms of a Quantum Mechanical\ntwo state system.In the Quantum Mechanical world a two state system[3]\ncould be represented by the equations\nih\u0304\n\ndC1\n= H11 C1 + H12 C2\ndt\n\nih\u0304\n\ndC2\n= H21 C1 + H22 C2\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the coefficients Hij are the Hamiltonian matrix and C is given by the\nvector,\nC \u2261 (C1 , C2 )\nWe now identify C with T and its two states Ta and Tb and write\nC \u2261 (C1 , C2 ) \u2261 (Ta , Tb ) \u2261 T\nThis reduces (5) to\nih\u0304\n\ndT\n= HT\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H is the 2x2 matrix. Taking t\u0304 = ih\u0304t reduces (6) to\ndT\n= HT\ndt\u0304\n\n(7)\n\nReverting back to equation(3) and replacing t with T we have\n\u2202U(T )\ndT\n=\u2212\n+ F (t)\ndt\n\u2202t\nTaking\n\u2212\n\n\u2202U(T )\n+ F (t) = H(T ), we get\n\u2202t\n\ndT\n= HT\ndt\n\n(8)\n3\n\n\f(8) is identical to (7).We note that from Quantum Mechanical Theory,\n\u2206t\n\n\u03b1\n\nh\u0304\nH\n\n(9)\n\nTo proceed further and establish the correspondence fully,we now observe\nH12 =H21 is proportional to the transition probability of C1 to C2 i e., Ta to\nTb In fact[4]\nH12\n\n\u03b1\n\ne\u2212U/kT\n\nSo the transition time in Quantum Theory is given by\n\u2206t\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\nH\n\n\u03b1\n\neU/kT\n\n(10)\n\n(10) can be identified with equation (4). This establishes the required result.\nThe reduction of the Climate problem to the analogous Quantum Mechanical\nproblem has interesting consequences which need to be studied further.This\nis all the more so because in recent years \"Scaled\" Quantum effects have\nbeen studied in macroscopic systems and even a Bode-Titius type relation\nfor planetary distances has been deduced on the basis of \"quantized\" energy\nlevels.[5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nReferences\n[1] I.Prigogine,G.Nicolis,\"Exploring Complexity\",R.Piper,GmbH,Munich,1989,pp.226 ff.\n[2] A.Berger.,(ed)\"Climatic Variations and Variability:facts and theories\",Reidel,Dordrecth,1981.\n[3] R.P.Feynman,R.B.Leighton,and M.Sands,\"The Feynman Lectures on Physics\",Vol.III,Addison-Wesley PublishingCo.,Inc.,Massachussets,1965,Chapter 8 ff.\n[4] F.Reif,\"Statistical and Thermal Physics\",McGraw-Hill,Singapore,1965.\n[5] B.G.Sidharth,Chaos,Solitons and Fractals,12,2001,613-616.\n[6] B.G.Sidharth,Chaos,Solitons and Fractals,12,2001,1371-1373.\n4\n\n\f[7] L.Nottale,\"Fractal Space-Time and Microphysics:Towards a Theory of\nScale Relativity\",World Scientific,Singapore,1993,p.312.\n[8] A.G.Agnese and R.Festa,Phys.Lett.A.,227,1997,p.165-171.\n\n5\n\n\f"}
