At the end of the paper we generalize some of these results to positive\ncharacteristic.\n\n1. Introduction\nThroughout this paper (except for Section 9), k denotes an algebraically closed\nfield of characteristic zero. By a fusion category C over k we mean a k-linear\nsemisimple rigid tensor (=monoidal) category with finitely many simple objects\nand finite dimensional spaces of morphisms, such that the endomorphism algebra\nof the neutral object is k (see [BaKi]). Fusion categories arise in several areas of\nmathematics and physics \u2013 conformal field theory, operator algebras, representation\ntheory of quantum groups, and others.\nThis paper is devoted to the study of general properties of fusion categories. This\nhas been an area of intensive research for a number of years, and many remarkable\nresults have been obtained. However, many of these results were proved not in\ngeneral but under various assumptions on the category. The goal of this paper is to\nremove such assumptions, and to give an account of the theory of fusion categories\nin full generality.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows.\nIn Section 2, we give our main results about squared norms, global dimensions,\nweak Hopf algebras, and Ocneanu rigidity. This section contains many results which\nare partially or fully due to other authors, and our own results are blended in at\nappropriate places.\nSections 3-7 are mostly devoted to review of the technical tools and to proofs of\nthe results of Section 2. Namely, in section 3, we prove one of the main theorems\nof this paper, saying that any fusion category has a nonzero global dimension (in\nfact, we show that for k = C, the dimension is positive). The proof relies in an\nessential way on the theorem that in any fusion category, the identity functor is\nisomorphic to \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217 : V 7\u2192 V \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 (where V 7\u2192 V \u2217 is the duality in C), as a tensor\nfunctor, which is proved using the theory of weak Hopf algebras (more specifically,\nthe formula for the fourth power of the antipode from [N]). We also prove that the\nSL2 (Z)-representation attached to any modular category over C is unitary.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nIn Section 4, we give a short review of the theory of weak Hopf algebras, which\nare both a tool and an object of study in this paper, and prove the isomorphism\nbetween the identity functor Id and \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217, which is crucial for the main theorem.\nIn Section 5, we prove a formula for the trace of squared antipode of a semisimple\nconnected regular weak Hopf algebra. Then we proceed to prove a number of results\n(partially due to M\u00fcger) about semisimplicity of the category of module functors\nbetween module categories over a fusion category, in particular of the dual and\nthe Drinfeld center. We also generalize these results to multi-fusion categories\n(the notion obtained from that of a fusion category by relaxing the condition that\nEnd(1) = k). In particular, we prove that a semisimple weak Hopf algebra over k\nis cosemisimple. Finally, we prove a categorical version of the class equation of Kac\nand Zhu.\nIn Section 6, we consider a pair of semisimple weak Hopf algebras B \u2282 A and\nstudy the subcomplex of B-invariants in the co-Hochschild complex of A (this complex is a weak analog of the complex considered in [Sch], [EG1] for Hopf algebras).\nWe prove that this complex is acyclic in positive degrees.\nIn Section 7, we show that the complex considered in Section 6 coincides with\nthe deformation complex of a monodial functor between two multi-fusion categories\nintroduced independently by Yetter [Y1, Y2] and Davydov [Da]. Using this, we\nestablish \"Ocneanu rigidity\" (absence of deformations) for arbitrary nondegenerate\nmulti-fusion categories and tensor functors between them. The idea of the proof\nof this result is due to Ocneanu-Blanchard-Wassermann, and the fusion category\ncase was worked out completely by Blanchard-Wassermann in [Wa, BWa] under\nthe assumption that the global dimension is non-zero.\nIn Section 8 we discuss the notion of Frobenius-Perron dimensions of objects in\na fusion category, show that they are additive and multiplicative, and have similar\nproperties to categorical dimensions in a pivotal category. We prove a categorical\nanalogue of the Nichols-Zoeller freeness theorem (saying that a finite dimensional\nHopf algebra is a free module over a Hopf subalgebra), in particular prove the freeness theorem for semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras. We also show that the global\ndimension of a fusion category is divisible by its Frobenius-Perron dimension (in\nthe ring of algebraic integers), and the ratio is \u2264 1. In particular, if the FrobeniusPerron dimension of a fusion category is an integer, then it coincides with the global\ndimension. This result may be regarded as a categorical version of the well known\ntheorem of Larson and Radford, saying that the antipode of a semisimple Hopf\nalgebra is involutive. Further, we show that the Frobenius-Perron dimension of a\nfusion category is divisible by the Frobenius-Perron dimension of its full subcategory, and use this result to show that any fusion category of Frobenius-Perron\ndimension p (a prime) is the category of representations of a cyclic group with a\n3-cocycle. We also classify fusion categories of dimension p2 . Finally, we show\nthat the property of a fusion category to have integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions\n(which is equivalent to being the representation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra) is\nstable under basic operations with categories, in particular is \"weak Morita invariant\" (i.e. invariant under passing to the the opposite of the dual category). At the\nend of the section we define group-theoretical fusion categories, which is a subclass\nof fusion categories with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions; they are constructed\nexplicitly from finite groups.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n3\n\nMany of the results of this paper have analogs in positive characteristic. These\ngeneralizations are given in Section 9. In particular, we show that a fusion category\nof nonzero global dimension over a field of positive characteristic can be lifted to\ncharacteristic zero.\nThroughout the paper, we are going to freely use the theory of rigid tensor\ncategories. We refer the reader to the textbooks [K],[BaKi] for details. We also\nrecommend the reader the expository paper [CE], where much of the content of\nthis paper is discussed in detail.\nAcknowledgments.

Results on squared norms, global dimensions, weak Hopf\nalgebras, and Ocneanu rigidity\nLet k be an algebraically closed field. By a multi-fusion category over k we mean\na rigid semisimple k-linear tensor category C with finitely many simple objects and\nfinite dimensional spaces of morphisms. If the unit object 1 of C is simple, then\nthe category C is said to be a fusion category. Otherwise (if 1 is not simple), it is\neasy to see that we have 1 = \u2295i\u2208J 1i , where 1i are pairwise nonisomorphic simple\nobjects.\nLet us list a few examples to keep in mind when thinking about fusion and\nmulti-fusion categories.\nExamples of fusion categories.\n1. The category VecG of finite dimensional vector spaces graded by a finite group\nG (or, equivalently, finite dimensional modules over the function algebra Fun(G, k).)\nSimple objects in this category are evaluation modules Vg , g \u2208 G, and the tensor\nproduct is given by Vg \u2297 Vh = Vgh , with the associativity morphism being the\nidentity.\nMore generally, pick a 3-cocycle \u03c9 \u2208 Z 3 (G, k \u00d7 ). To this cocycle we can attach a\ntwisted version VecG,\u03c9 of VecG : the simple objects and the tensor product functor\nare the same, but the associativity isomorphism is given by \u03a6Vg ,Vh ,Vk = \u03c9(g, h, k)id.\nThe pentagon axiom then follows from the cocycle condition\n\u03c9(h, k, l)\u03c9(g, hk, l)\u03c9(g, h, k) = \u03c9(gh, k, l)\u03c9(g, h, kl).\nNote that cohomologous cocycles define equivalent fusion categories.\n2. The category of finite dimensional k-representations of a finite group G, whose\norder is relatively prime to the characteristic of k.\n3.

The tensor product in this category is the fusion product,\ndefined at the level of objects by the Verlinde fusion rule\nl\u2212|i+j\u2212l|\n\nVi \u2297 Vj =\n\nX\n\nk=|i\u2212j|\nk\u2261i+j mod 2\n\nExamples of multi-fusion categories.\n\nVk\n\n\f4\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\n1. The category of finite dimensional bimodules over a finite dimensional semisimple k-algebra, with bimodule tensor product. It has simple objects Mij with\n\"matrix\" tensor product Mij \u2297 Mjk = Mik ; thus the identity object is 1 = \u2295i Mii .\n2. The category of finite dimensional modules over the function algebra on a\nfinite groupoid.\n2.1. Squared norms and global dimensions. Let us introduce the notion of\nthe global dimension of a fusion category. First of all, we have the following known\nresult (see e.g., [O]).\nProposition 2.1. In a fusion category, any simple object V is isomorphic to its\ndouble dual V \u2217\u2217 .\nTo prove this, it suffices to note that for any simple object V , the right dual V \u2217\nis the unique simple object X for which V \u2297 X contains the neutral object, while\nthe left dual \u2217 V is the unique simple object X for which V \u2297 X projects to the\nneutral object; so \u2217 V = V \u2217 by semisimplicity of the category, and hence V = V \u2217\u2217\nfor any simple V .\nNext, recall ([BaKi], p.39) that if V \u2208 C, and g : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 is a morphism, then\none can define its \"quantum trace\" TrV (g) \u2208 k by the formula\nTrV (g) = evV \u2217 \u25e6 (g \u2297 1V \u2217 ) \u25e6 coevV ,\n\nwhere 1 is the unit object of C, coevV : 1 \u2192 V \u2297 V \u2217 and evV : V \u2217 \u2297 V \u2192 1 are the\ncoevaluation and evaluation maps (see [BaKi]). It is easy to show (and well known,\nsee e.g. [BaKi]) that for any simple object V and a nonzero morphism a : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217\none has TrV (a) 6= 0. Indeed, otherwise there is a sequence of nonzero maps 1 \u2192\nV \u2297 V \u2217 \u2192 1 with zero composition, which would imply that the multiplicity of 1\nin V \u2297 V \u2217 is at least 2 \u2013 a contradiction.\nNow, following [Mu1], for every simple object V of a fusion category C, define\nthe squared norm |V |2 \u2208 k \u00d7 of V as follows. Fix an isomorphism a : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217\n(which exists by Proposition 2.1), and let |V |2 = TrV (a)TrV \u2217 ((a\u22121 )\u2217 ). It is clearly\nindependent on the choice of a (since a is uniquely determined up to a scaling),\nand nonzero by the explanation in the previous paragraph. For example, for the\nneutral object 1 we have |1|2 = 1.\nDefinition 2.2. [Mu1] The global dimension of a fusion category C is the sum of\nsquared norms of its simple objects. It is denoted by dim(C).\nOne of our main results is\nTheorem 2.3. If k = C then |V |2 > 0 for all simple objects V \u2208 C; therefore\ndim(C) \u2265 1, and is > 1 for any nontrivial C. In particular, for any fusion category\nC one has dim(C) 6= 0.\nRemark 2.4. Note that the second statement immediately follows from the first\none, since C is always defined over a finitely generated subfield k \u2032 of k, which can\nbe embedded into C.\nThe proof of Theorem 2.3, which relies on Theorem 2.6 below, is given in Section 3. Theorem 2.6 is proved in Section 4.\nRemark 2.5. In the course of proof of Theorem 2.3 we show that for any simple\nobject V , the number |V |2 is an eigenvalue of an integer matrix. In particular, if\nk = C then |V |2 is an algebraic integer. Thus, for k = C Theorem 2.3 actually\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n5\n\nimplies that |V |2 is a \"totally positive\" algebraic integer, i.e. all its conjugates are\nreal and positive (since one can twist a fusion category by an automorphism of\nC and get a new fusion category). Similarly, dim(C) is \"totally\" \u2265 1, i.e. all its\nconjugates are \u2265 1.\nOne of the main tools in the proof of Theorem 2.3 is\n\nTheorem 2.6. In any fusion category, the identity functor is isomorphic to the\nfunctor **** as a tensor functor.\nFor the category of representations of a Hopf algebra, this result follows from\nRadford's formula for S 4 [R1]. In general, it follows from the analog of Radford's\nformula for weak Hopf algebras, which was proved by the second author in [N] (see\nSection 4).\nDefinition 2.7. A pivotal structure on a fusion category C is an isomorphism of\ntensor functors i : Id \u2192 \u2217\u2217. A fusion category equipped with a pivotal structure is\nsaid to be a pivotal fusion category.\nWe conjecture a stronger form of Theorem 2.6:\nConjecture 2.8. Any fusion category admits a pivotal structure.\nFor example, this is true for the representation category of a semisimple Hopf\nalgebra over k, since in this case by the Larson-Radford theorem [LR2], the squared\nantipode is 1 and hence Id = \u2217\u2217. Furthermore, in Section 8 we will show that\nthe conjecture is true for the representation category of a semisimple quasi-Hopf\nalgebra.\n2.2. Results on pivotal, spherical, and modular categories. Now let C be\na pivotal fusion category. In such a category, one can define the dimension of an\nobject V by dim(V ) = TrV (i), and we have the following result which justifies the\nnotation |V |2 .\nProposition 2.9. In a pivotal fusion category one has |V |2 = dim(V ) dim(V \u2217 )\nfor any simple object V . Moreover, if k = C then dim(V \u2217 ) = dim(V ), so |V |2 =\n| dim(V )|2 .\n\nProposition 2.9 is proved in Section 3.\nThis result can be further specialized to spherical (in particular, ribbon) categories, (see [Mu1]). Namely, recall from [Mu1] that a pivotal fusion category is\nspherical if and only if dim(V ) = dim(V \u2217 ) for all simple objects V . Thus we have\nthe following corollary.\n\nCorollary 2.10. In a spherical category, |V |2 = dim(V )2 . In particular, if k = C,\nthen dim(V ) is (totally) real.\nCorollary 2.10 readily follows from Proposition 2.9.\nRemark 2.11. We note that in [Mu1], the number |V |2 is called the squared dimension of V , and denoted d2 (V ). We do not use this terminology for the following\nreason. In a pivotal category over C, the dimensions of simple objects do not have\nto be real numbers (it suffices to consider the category of representations of a finite\ngroup G, where i is given by a nontrivial central element of G). Thus, in general\ndim(V \u2217 ) 6= dim(V ), and |V |2 6= dim(V )2 . Therefore, the term \"squared dimension\", while being adequate in the framework of spherical categories of [Mu1], is no\nlonger adequate in our more general setting.\n\n\f6\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nNow assume that C is a modular category (i.e., a ribbon fusion category with a\nnondegenerate S-matrix, see [BaKi]). In this case one can define matrices S and T\nof algebraic numbers, which yield a projective representation of the modular group\nSL2 (Z) ([BaKi]). We note that the matrix S is defined only up to a sign, since\nin the process of defining S it is necessary to extract a square root of the global\ndimension of C. So to be more precise we should say that by a modular category\nwe mean the underlying ribbon category together with a choice of this sign.\nProposition 2.12. If k = C then the projective representation of SL2 (Z) associated to C is unitary in the standard hermitian metric (i.e. the matrices S and T\nare unitary).\nProposition 2.12 is proved in Section 3.\nRemark 2.13. As before, the proposition actually means that this representation\nis totally unitary, i.e. the algebraic conjugates of this representation are unitary as\nwell.\nRemark 2.14. It is interesting whether Proposition 2.12 generalizes to mapping\nclass groups of higher genus Riemann surfaces.\nWe note that the results of this subsection are known for hermitian categories\n[BaKi]. Our results imply that these results are valid without this assumption.\n2.3. Module categories, the dual category, the Drinfeld center. Let M\nbe an indecomposable left module category over a rigid tensor category C [O] (all\nmodule categories we consider are assumed semisimple). This means, M is a module\ncategory which cannot be split in a direct sum of two nonzero module subcategories.\n\u2217\nIn this case one can define the dual category CM\nto be the category of module\n\u2217\nfunctors from M to itself: CM\n= FunC (M, M) [O]. This is a rigid tensor category\n(the tensor product is the composition of functors, the right and left duals are the\nright and left adjoint functors).\nFor example, let us consider C itself as a module category over C \u2297 C op , via\n(X, Y ) \u2297 Z = X \u2297 Z \u2297 Y . Then the dual category is the Drinfeld center Z(C) of C\n(see [O1, Mu2]; for the basic theory of the Drinfeld center see [K]).\nThe following result was proved by M\u00fcger [Mu1, Mu2] under the assumption\ndim(C) 6= 0 (which, as we have seen, is superfluous in zero characteristic) and\nminor additional assumptions.\nTheorem 2.15. For any indecomposable module category M over a fusion category\n\u2217\n\u2217\nC, the category CM\nis semisimple (so it is a fusion category), and dim(CM\n) =\ndim(C). In particular, for any fusion category C the category Z(C) is a fusion\ncategory of global dimension dim(C)2 .\nIn fact, we have the following more general results, which (as well as the results\nin the next subsection) are inspired by [Mu1, Mu2].\nTheorem 2.16. For any module categories M1 , M2 over a fusion category C, the\ncategory of module functors FunC (M1 , M2 ) is semisimple.\nTheorems 2.15 and 2.16 are proved in Section 5.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n7\n\n2.4. Multi-fusion categories. We say that a multi-fusion category C is indecomposable if it is not a direct sum of two nonzero multi-fusion categories.\nLet C be a multi-fusion category. Then for any simple object X \u2208 C there\nexist unique i, j \u2208 J such that 1i \u2297 X 6= 0 and X \u2297 1j 6= 0; moreover, we have\n1i \u2297 X = X \u2297 1j = X. Thus, as an additive category, C = \u2295m,n Cmn , where\nCmn is the full abelian subcategory of C with simple objects having i = m, j = n.\nIt is easy to check that Cii are fusion categories for all i, and Cij are (Cii , Cjj )bimodule categories, equipped with product functors Cij \u00d7 Cjl \u2192 Cil satisfying\nsome compatibility conditions. We will refer to Cii as the component categories of\nC.\nSince Cii are fusion categories, they have well defined global dimensions. In\nfact, the off-diagonal subcategories Cij can also be assigned global dimensions, even\nthough they are not tensor categories. To do this, observe that for any simple object\nV \u2208 Cij , and any morphism g : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 one can define TrV (g) \u2208 End(1i ) = k.\nTherefore, we can define\n|V |2 by the usual formula |V |2 = TrV (g)TrV \u2217 ((g \u22121 )\u2217 ),\nP\nand set dim(Cij ) := V \u2208IrrCij |V |2 .\nProposition 2.17. If C is an indecomposable multi-fusion category, then all the\ncategories Cij have the same global dimensions.\nThe setup of the previous section can be generalized to the multi-fusion case.\nNamely, we have the following generalization of Theorem 2.16 to the multi-fusion\ncase:\nTheorem 2.18. If C is a multi-fusion category, and M1 , M2 are module categories\nover C, then the category FunC (M1 , M2 ) is semisimple. In particular, the category\n\u2217\nCM\nis semisimple for any module category M.\nProposition 2.17 and Theorem 2.18 is proved in Section 5.\nRemark 2.19. We note that it follows from the arguments of [O, Mu1] that if C\nis a multifusion category and M is a faithful module category of M, then M is a\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2217\nfaithful module category over CM\n, and (CM\n)M = C.\n2.5. Results on weak Hopf algebras. A convenient way to visualize (multi-)\nfusion categories is using weak Hopf algebras (see Section 4 for the definitions).\nNamely, let C be a multi-fusion category. Let R be a finite dimensional semisimple\nk-algebra, and F a fiber functor (i.e. an exact, faithful tensor functor) from C to\nR-bimod. Let A = Endk (F ) (i.e. the algebra of endomorphisms of the composition\nof F with the forgetful functor to vector spaces).\nTheorem 2.20. ([Sz]) A has a natural structure of a semisimple weak Hopf algebra\nwith base R, and C is equivalent, as a tensor category, to the category Rep(A) of\nfinite dimensional representations of A.\nRemark 2.21. In order to lift the naturally existing map A \u2192 A \u2297R A to a weak\nHopf algebra coproduct A \u2192 A \u2297k A, one needs to use a separability idempotent in\nR \u2297 R. We will always use the unique symmetric separability idempotent. In this\ncase, the weak Hopf algebra A satisfies an additional regularity condition, saying\nthat the squared antipode is the identity on the base of A.\nOne can show that for any multi-fusion category C, a fiber functor F exists for\na suitable R. Indeed, let M be any semisimple faithful module category over C,\n\n\f8\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\ni.e. such that any nonzero object of C acts by nonzero (for example, C itself).\nLet R be a semisimple algebra whose blocks are labeled by simple objects of M:\nR = \u2295M\u2208Irr(M) RM , and RM are simple. Now define a functor F : C \u2192 R \u2212 bimod\nas follows: for any object X \u2208 C set\nF (X) = \u2295M,N \u2208Irr(M) HomM (M, X \u2297 N ) \u2297 BN M ,\n\nwhere BN M is the simple (RN , RM )-bimodule. This functor has an obvious tensor\nstructure (coming from composition of morphisms), and it is clearly exact and\nfaithful. So it is a fiber functor.\nTherefore, we have\nCorollary 2.22. ([H],[Sz]) Any multi-fusion category is equivalent to the category\nof finite dimensional representations of a (non-unique) regular semisimple weak\nHopf algebra. This weak Hopf algebra is connected if and only if C is a fusion\ncategory.\nRemark 2.23. In particular, we can choose R to be a commutative algebra (i.e.,\nall blocks have size 1). Thus, any multi-fusion category is equivalent to the category\nof representations of a weak Hopf algebra with a commutative base. This result\nwas proved by Hayashi in [H], where weak Hopf algebras with commutative bases\nappear under the name \"face algebras\".\nThe language of weak Hopf algebras is convenient to visualize various categorical\nconstructions. One of them is that of a dual category. Indeed, let C be the category\nof representations of a weak Hopf algebra A. Let R be the base of A. Then we\nhave a natural fiber functor from C to the category of R-bimodules \u2013 the forgetful\nfunctor. This functor defines a natural structure of a module category over C on\n\u2217\nthe category M = R \u2212 bimod. In this case, the dual category CM\nis simply the\n\u2217cop\nrepresentation category of the dual weak Hopf algebra A\nwith the opposite\ncoproduct (see [O]). Furthermore, as we just showed, this example is general, in\nthe sense that any faithful module category over a multi-fusion category can be\nobtained in this way.\nThe global dimension of the category of representations of a connected weak\nHopf algebra is closely related to the trace of squared antipode in this weak Hopf\nalgebra. This connection is expressed by the following theorem.\nLet a fusion category C be the representation category of a regular semisimple\nweak Hopf algebra A. Let S be the antipode of A. Let qi be the primitive idempotents of the center of the base At , and ni the block sizes of the matrix algebras\nqi At .\nTheorem 2.24. One has Tr(S 2 |qj AS(qi ) ) = dim(C)n2i n2j . In particular, over C one\nalways has Tr(S 2 |qj AS(qi ) ) > 0.\nRemark 2.25. Theorem 2.24 implies that Tr(S 2 |A ) = dim(Rep(A)) dim(At )2 .\nWe also have the following result, which generalizes the Larson-Radford theorem\nfor Hopf algebras [LR1].\nTheorem 2.26. A semisimple weak Hopf algebra over k is also cosemisimple.\nTheorem 2.24 is proved in Section 5. Theorem 2.26 follows from Theorem 2.18,\nsince the representation category of the dual weak Hopf algebra is the dual category.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n9\n\n2.6. Vanishing of the Yetter cohomology. The cohomology theory that controls deformations of tensor categories and tensor functors is the cohomology theory\ndeveloped in [CY, Y1, Y2, Da], which we will call the Yetter cohomology theory.\nThis theory associates to any tensor category C and a tensor functor F for C to\nanother tensor category C \u2032 , a sequence of cohomology spaces HFi (C) (See Section\n7). If F is the identity functor, then these groups are simply denoted by H i (C).\nNamely, first order deformations of C are elements of H 3 (C), while first order deformations of a tensor structure on a given functor F between fixed tensor categories\nC, C \u2032 are elements of HF2 (C). Obstructions to such deformations lie, respectively, in\nH 4 (C) and HF3 (C).\nFor multi-fusion categories, the Yetter cohomology often vanishes. Namely, we\nhave the following result.\nTheorem 2.27. Let C, C \u2032 be multi-fusion categories, and F : C \u2192 C \u2032 be a (unital)\ntensor functor from C to C \u2032 . Then HFi (C) = 0 for i > 0.\nTheorem 2.27 is proved in Section 7, using weak Hopf algebras. The idea of this\nproof is due to Ocneanu, Blanchard, and Wassermann.\n2.7. Ocneanu rigidity. The statement that a fusion category over a field of characteristic zero cannot be nontivially deformed is known as Ocneanu rigidity, because\nits formulation and proof for unitary categories was suggested (but not published)\nby Ocneanu. Later Blanchard and Wassermann ([BWa, Wa]) proposed an algebraic\nversion of Ocneanu's argument, which proves the following result.\nTheorem 2.28. A fusion category does not admit nontrivial deformations. In particular, the number of such categories (up to equivalence) with a given Grothendieck\nring (=fusion rules) is finite.\nRemark 2.29. This theorem is proved in [BWa, Wa] under the assumption that\ndim(C) 6= 0, but as we know from Theorem 2.3, this assumption is superfluous in\nzero characteristic.\nIn fact, one has the following somewhat more general theorem.\nTheorem 2.30. Theorem 2.28 is valid for multi-fusion categories.\nThis theorem follows directly from Theorem 2.27 for i = 3 and F = Id (this\nis, essentially, the proof of Ocneanu-Blanchard-Wassermann). A sketch of proof is\ngiven in Section 7.\nNote that Theorem 2.30 implies that any multi-fusion category is defined over\nan algebraic number field.\nQuestion. Is any multi-fusion category defined over a cyclotomic field?\nNote that the answer is yes for fusion categories coming from quantum groups\nat roots of unity, for the categories of [TY], and for group-theoretical categories\ndiscussed in Section 8. Also, it follows from the results of subsection 8.10 that the\nglobal dimension of a fusion category belongs to a cyclotomic field.\nWe also have\nTheorem 2.31. A (unital) tensor functor between multi-fusion categories does not\nhave nontrivial deformations. In particular, the number of such functors (up to\nequivalence) for fixed source and target categories is finite.\n\n\f10\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nRemark 2.32. In particular, Theorem 2.31 implies that a given fusion category\nhas finitely many fiber functors. This is also shown in [IK] in the special case of\ncategories coming from subfactors (see Theorem 2.4 in [IK]).\nRemark 2.33. Theorem 2.31 also implies Ocneanu's result that a given fusion\ncategory has finitely many braidings. Indeed, any braiding in particular defines an\nequivalence of tensor categories between C and C op .\nThe proof of Theorem 2.31 is analogous to the proof of Theorem 2.30. Namely,\nthe first part of the result follows directly from Theorem 2.27 for i = 2. The second\npart is a consequence of a combinatorial fact that there are only finitely many homomorphisms between the Grothendieck rings of the categories under consideration;\nthis fact is a consequence of Proposition 2.1 of [O] since the second Grothendieck\nring can be considered as a based module over the first one.\nRemark 2.34. One says that an indecomposable multi-fusion category C \u2032 is a\nquotient category of an indecomposable multi-fusion category C if there exists a\ntensor functor F : C \u2192 C \u2032 such that any object of C \u2032 is a subobject of F (X), X \u2208 C\n(See Section 5). It follows from the above that a given multi-fusion category C has\nonly finitely many quotient categories.\nCorollary 2.35. A module category M over a multi-fusion category C does not\nadmit nontrivial deformations. In particular, the number of such module categories\n(up to equivalence) with a given number of simple objects is finite.\nTo prove Corollary 2.35, it suffices to choose a semisimple algebra R with number\nof blocks equal to the number of simple objects in M, and apply Theorem 2.31 to\nthe functor F : C \u2192 R \u2212 bimod associated with M.\nRemark 2.36. We note that this result was conjectured in [O].\n3. Fusion categories over C\nThe goal of this subsection is to prove Theorem 2.3, Proposition 2.9, Proposition\n2.12, and discuss their consequences.\nLet C denote a fusion category over C. We will denote representatives of isomorphism classes of simple objects of C by Xi , i \u2208 I, with 0 \u2208 I labeling the\nneutral object 1. Denote by \u2217 : I \u2192 I the dualization map. (We note that at the\nlevel of labels, there is no distinction between right and left dualization, since by\nProposition 2.1, V is isomorphic to V \u2217\u2217 for any simple object V ).\n3.1. Proof of Theorem 2.3. By Theorem 2.6, there exists an isomorphism of\ntensor functors g : Id \u2192 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217. Let us fix such an isomorphism. So for each simple\nV \u2208 C we have a morphism gV : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 such that gV \u2297W = gV \u2297 gW , and gV \u2217 =\n(gV\u22121 )\u2217 . For all simple V , let us fix an isomorphism aV : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 such that a2V = gV\n(a2V makes sense as Hom(V, V \u2217\u2217 ) is canonically isomorphic to Hom(V \u2217\u2217 , V \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 ),\nand so aV can also be regarded as an element of Hom(V \u2217\u2217 , V \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 )). Then aV \u2217 =\n\u2217\n\u01ebV (a\u22121\nV ) , where \u01ebV = \u00b11, and \u01ebV \u01ebV \u2217 = 1. Define d(V ) = TrV (aV ), in particular\ndi = d(Xi ). These numbers are not at all canonical \u2013 they depend on the choices we\nmade. Nevertheless, it is easy to see from the definition that |V |2 = \u01ebV d(V )d(V \u2217 ).\nNow let us take any simple objects V, W \u2208 C and consider the tensor product\naV \u2297 aW : V \u2297 W \u2192 (V \u2297 W )\u2217\u2217 . We have V \u2297 W = \u2295U Hom(U, V \u2297 W ) \u2297 U , so we\nhave aV \u2297aW = \u2295bVU W \u2297aU , where bVU W : Hom(U, V \u2297W ) \u2192 Hom(U \u2217\u2217 , V \u2217\u2217 \u2297W \u2217\u2217 ).\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n11\n\nThe source and target of this map are actually canonically isomorphic, so we can\ntreat bVU W as an automorphism of Hom(U, V \u2297 W ). Also, since a2V = gV and\ngV \u2297W = gV \u2297 gW , we get (bVU W )2 = 1.\nXi Xk\nik 2\nLet bik\n. Let Tjik = tr(bik\nj := bXj\nj ). Since (bj ) = 1, its eigenvalues are \u00b11,\nhence Tjik are integers.\nBy the definition of bik\nj , we have\nX\ndi dk =\nTjik dj\nj\u2208I\n\nLet Ti be the matrix such that (Ti )kj = Tjik , and let d be the vector with components di . This vector is clearly nonzero (e.g., d0 6= 0), and we have\nTi d = di d.\n\nThus, d is a common eigenvector of Ti with eigenvalue di .\nLet \u01ebi = \u01ebXi . Then we have: d is an eigenvector of the matrix Ai = \u01ebi Ti Ti\u2217 with\neigenvalue |Xi |2 .\nWe claim that Ti\u2217 = \u01ebi Tit . This implies the theorem, as in this case Ai = Ti Tit ,\nwhich is nonnegative definite (since the entries of Ti are integer, hence real), so its\neigenvalues, including |Xi |2 , have to be nonnegative.\n\u2217\nTo prove that Ti\u2217 = \u01ebi Tit , we need to show that Tji k = \u01ebi Tkij . But this, in turn,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfollows from the equality bij k = \u01ebi (bij\nk ) (which makes sense since we have canonical\nisomorphisms Hom(U, V \u2297 W ) \u2192 Hom(V \u2217 \u2297 U, W ) \u2192 Hom(W, V \u2217 \u2297 U )\u2217 , the latter\nby semisimplicity).\nIt remains to prove the last equality. Let f : Xj \u2192 Xi \u2297 Xk be a morphism. By\n\u22121\nthe definition, bik\nj f = (ai \u2297 ak )f aj . On the other hand, f gives rise to an element\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf : Xi\u2217 \u2297 Xj \u2192 Xk , given by f = (evi \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 f ), and hence to a linear function\non Hom(Xk , Xi\u2217 \u2297 Xj ) given by f \u2032\u2032 (h) = (evi \u2297 1)(1i\u2217 \u2297 f )h \u2208 End(Xk ) = C (for\nbrevity we omit associativity maps and use the same notation for a morphism and\nits double dual). Now, we have\n\u2032\u2032\n(bik\nj f ) (h) =\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n(evi \u2297 1)(1i\u2217 \u2297 (ai \u2297 ak )f a\u22121\nj )h\n\u22121\n\u01ebi ak (evi \u2297 1)(a\u22121\ni\u2217 \u2297 f aj )h\n\n\u22121\n\u01ebi (evi \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 f )(a\u22121\ni\u2217 \u2297 aj )hak\n\n\u01ebi (evi \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 f )(ai\u2217 \u2297 aj )ha\u22121\nk ,\n\nwhere the last equality due to the facts that gV \u2297W = gV \u2297 gW , and aV = gV a\u22121\nV .\nThus,\n\u2217\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032 i j\n(bik\nj f ) (h) = f (bk h),\nas desired. Theorem 2.3 is proved.\nRemark 3.1. Here is a modification of the above proof, which is simpler but\nrequires an extension of the category C.\nThe first step is to prove the result in the case of pivotal categories. This is a\nsubstantially simplified version of the above proof, since in the pivotal case \u01ebi and\nik\nik\nbik\nj are 1, so Tj are equal to Nj , the multiplicity of Xj in Xi \u2297 Xk .\nThe second step is reduction to the pivotal case. To do this, take the isomorphism\ng : Id \u2192 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217 as tensor functors constructed in the proof of Theorem 2.6. Define\n \u0303 whose simple objects are pairs (X, f ), where X is a simple\nthe fusion category C,\n\n\f12\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nobject of C, and f : X \u2192 X \u2217\u2217 is an isomorphism, such that f \u2217\u2217 f = g. It is easy to\n \u0303\nsee that this fusion category has a canonical pivotal structure. Thus, |X|2 > 0 in C.\nHowever, we have the forgetful functor F : C \u0303 \u2192 C, F (X, f ) = X, which obviously\npreserves squared norms. Hence, |V |2 > 0 for simple objects V in C (since for any\nV there exists f : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 such that f \u2217\u2217 f = g), which completes the proof.\n3.2. Proof of Proposition 2.9. The first statement is straightforward. To prove\nthe second statement, let Ni be the matrix whose entries are given by (Ni )kj =\ndimHom(Xj , Xi \u2297 Xk ). Then, like in the proof of Theorem 2.3, Ni d = di d. Let\nus multiply this equation on the left by d\u2217 . (the hermitian adjoint). We have\nd\u2217 Ni = (Nit d)\u2217 = (Ni\u2217 d)\u2217 = di\u2217 d\u2217 . Thus the multiplication will yield\ndi\u2217 |d|2 = di |d|2 .\n\nSince |d|2 > 0, this yields the second statement. The proposition is proved.\n3.3. Proof of Proposition 2.12 and properties of modular categories. It is\nwell known (see [BaKi]) that the matrix T is diagonal with eigenvalues being roots\nof unity. So we only need to show that the S-matrix\nP is unitary. The entries sij of\nthe S-matrix are known to satisfy sij = sji , and j si\u2217 j sjl = \u03b4il ([BaKi]). So it\nsuffices to show that si\u2217 j = sij . \u221a\nRecall that sj0 = \u00b1 dim(Vj )/ D, where D is the global dimension of the category. So sj0 is a real number. Further, by the Verlinde formula ([BaKi, 3.1]), if vm\nis the m-th column of S then\nsim\nvm ,\nNi vm =\ns0m\n\u2217\nfor all i. Let vm\ndenote the row vector, Hermitian adjoint to vm .

An important property of modular categories is\nProposition 3.3. ([EG4],\n\u221a Lemma 1.2) The dimension of every simple object of a\nmodular category divides D, where D is the global dimension of the category.\nThis implies that in a ribbon category, dimensions of objects divide the global\ndimension (this is seen by taking the Drinfeld center and using Theorem 2.15 and\nthe well known fact that the Drinfeld center of a braided category contains the\noriginal category). This fact is useful in classification of modular categories (See\nsection 8).\nIn conclusion of this subsection let us give a simple application of Theorem 2.3\nto modular categories.\nLet c \u2208 C/8Z be the Virasoro central charge of a modular category C, defined\nby the relation (ST )3 = e2\u03c0ic/8 S 2 (see [BaKi]), and D be the global dimension of\nC. Let f : (\u2212\u221e, 1] \u2192 [1,\n\u221a\u221e) be the inverse function to the monotonely decreasing\nfunction g(x) = (3 \u2212 x) x/2.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n13\n\nProposition 3.4. One has\nD \u2265 f (sign(s00 ) cos(\u03c0c/4))\n\u221a\nRemark 3.5. The number s00 equals \u00b11/ D.\nProof. We need to show that\n\n\u221a\nsign(s00 ) cos(\u03c0c/4) \u2265 (3 \u2212 D) D/2\n\nTo prove this, recall [BaKi] that the number e\u03c0ic/4 can be expressed via a Gaussian\nsum:\nX\n\u221a\nsign(s00 )e\u03c0ic/4 =\n|Xi |2 \u03b8i / D,\nwhere \u03b8i are the twists.

Sometimes this\u221ainequality sharp. For example, for c = \u00b12/5, \u00b122/5,\nit yields an estimate D \u2265 (5 \u2212 5)/2, which becomes an equality for the well known\nYang-Lee category (c = \u221222/5, see [DMS]) and three its Galois images.\n\u221a The same\nis true for c = \u00b114/5, \u00b134/5, in which case the estimate is D \u2265 (5 + 5)/2 (it is\nattained at four Galois images of the Yang-Lee category). Also, it goes without\nsaying that the inequality is sharp for c = 0, where it becomes an equality for the\ntrivial category.\nThese considerations inspire the following questions.\nQuestions. Does there exist a sequence of nontrivial fusion categories over C\nfor which the global dimensions tend to 1? Does there exist such a sequence with\na bounded number of simple objects? Is the set of global dimensions of fusion\ncategories over C a discrete subset of R?\nWe expect that the answer to the first question is \"no\", i.e. the point 1 of the\nset of possible dimensions of fusion categories is an isolated point (\"categorical\nproperty T\").\n4. Weak Hopf algebras and their integrals\nBelow we collect the definition and basic properties of weak Hopf algebras.\n4.1. Definition of a weak Hopf algebra.\nDefinition 4.1 ([BNSz]). A weak Hopf algebra is a vector space A with the structures of an associative algebra (A, m, 1) with a multiplication m : A \u2297k A \u2192 A\nand unit 1 \u2208 A and a coassociative coalgebra (A, \u2206, \u01eb) with a comultiplication\n\u2206 : A \u2192 A \u2297k A and counit \u01eb : A \u2192 k such that:\n(i) The comultiplication \u2206 is a (not necessarily unit-preserving) homomorphism of algebras:\n(1)\n\n\u2206(hg) = \u2206(h)\u2206(g),\n\nh, g \u2208 A,\n\n\f14\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\n(ii) The unit and counit satisfy the following identities:\n(\u2206 \u2297 id)\u2206(1) =\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n\u01eb(f gh) =\n\n(\u2206(1) \u2297 1)(1 \u2297 \u2206(1)) = (1 \u2297 \u2206(1))(\u2206(1) \u2297 1),\n\u01eb(f g(1) ) \u01eb(g(2) h) = \u01eb(f g(2) ) \u01eb(g(1) h),\n\nfor all f, g, h \u2208 A.\n(iii) There is a linear map S : A \u2192 A, called an antipode, such that\nm(id \u2297 S)\u2206(h)\n\nm(S \u2297 id)\u2206(h)\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n= (\u01eb \u2297 id)(\u2206(1)(h \u2297 1)),\n\n= (id \u2297 \u01eb)((1 \u2297 h)\u2206(1)),\n\nS(h) = S(h(1) )h(2) S(h(3) ),\n\nfor all h \u2208 A.\nRemark 4.2. We use Sweedler's notation for a comultiplication: \u2206(c) = c(1) \u2297c(2) .\nAxioms (2) and (3) above are analogous to the usual bialgebra axioms of \u2206\nbeing a unit preserving map and \u01eb being an algebra homomorphism. Axioms (4)\nand (5) generalize the properties of the antipode in a Hopf algebra with respect to\nthe counit. Also, it is possible to show that given (1) - (5), axiom (6) is equivalent\nto S being both anti-algebra and anti-coalgebra map.\nThe antipode of a finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra is bijective [BNSz, 2.10].\nRemark 4.3. A weak Hopf algebra is a Hopf algebra if and only if the comultiplication is unit-preserving and if and only if \u01eb is a homomorphism of algebras.\nA morphism between weak Hopf algebras A1 and A2 is a map \u03c6 : A1 \u2192 A2\nwhich is both algebra and coalgebra homomorphism preserving 1 and \u01eb and which\nintertwines the antipodes of A1 and A2 , i.e., \u03c6 \u25e6 S1 = S2 \u25e6 \u03c6. The image of a\nmorphism is clearly a weak Hopf algebra.\nWhen dimk A < \u221e, there is a natural weak Hopf algebra structure on the dual\nvector space A\u2217 = Homk (A, k) given by\n\u03c6\u03c8(h) = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8)(\u2206(h)),\n\n(7)\n\n\u2206(\u03c6)(h \u2297 g) = \u03c6(hg)\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nS(\u03c6)(h) = \u03c6(S(h)),\n\u2217\n\nfor all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 A , h, g \u2208 A. The unit of A\u2217 is \u01eb and the counit is \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6(1).\nThe linear maps defined in (4) and (5) are called target and source counital maps\nand are denoted \u03b5t and \u03b5s respectively :\n(10)\n\n\u03b5t (h) = \u01eb(1(1) h)1(2) ,\n\n\u03b5s (h) = 1(1) \u01eb(h1(2) ),\n\nfor all h \u2208 A. The images of the counital maps\n\n(11)\n\nAt = \u03b5t (A),\n\nAs = \u03b5s (A)\n\nare separable subalgebras of A, called target and source bases or counital subalgebras\nof A. These subalgebras commute with each other; moreover\nAt\nAs\n\n= {(\u03c6 \u2297 id)\u2206(1) | \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 } = {h \u2208 A | \u2206(h) = \u2206(1)(h \u2297 1)},\n= {(id \u2297 \u03c6)\u2206(1) | \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 } = {h \u2208 A | \u2206(h) = (1 \u2297 h)\u2206(1)},\n\ni.e., At (respectively, As ) is generated by the right (respectively, left) tensor factors\nof \u2206(1) in the shortest possible presentation of \u2206(1) in A \u2297k A.\nThe category Rep(A) of left A-modules is a rigid tensor category [NTV]. The\ntensor product of two A-modules V and W is V \u2297At W with the A-module structure\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n15\n\ndefined via \u2206. The unit object 1 of Rep(A) is the target counital algebra At with\nthe action h * z = \u03b5t (hz) for all h \u2208 A, z \u2208 At .\nFor any algebra B we denote by Z(B) the center of B. Then the unit object of\nRep(A) is irreducible if and only if Z(A) \u2229 At = k. In this case we will say that A\nis connected. We will say that that A is coconnected if A\u2217 is connected, and that\nA is biconnected if it is both connected and coconnected.\nIf p 6= 0 is an idempotent in At \u2229 As \u2229 Z(A), then A is the direct sum of weak\nHopf algebras pA and (1 \u2212 p)A. Consequently, we say that A is indecomposable if\nAt \u2229 As \u2229 Z(A) = k1.\nEvery weak Hopf algebra A contains a canonical minimal weak Hopf subalgebra\nAmin generated, as an algebra, by At and As [N, Section 3]. In other words, Amin\nis the minimal weak Hopf subalgebra of A that contains 1. Obviously, A is an\nordinary Hopf algebra if and only if Amin = k1. Minimal weak Hopf algebras over\nk, i.e., those for which A = Amin , were completely classified in [N, Proposition 3.4].\nThe restriction of S 2 on Amin is always an inner automorphism of Amin , see [N].\nRemark 4.4. Unless indicated otherwise, in what follows we will use only weak\nHopf algebras satisfying the following natural property :\nS 2 |Amin = id.\n\n(12)\n\nThis property has an easy categorical interpretation. Let 1 = At be the trivial\nA-module. Then (12) is satisfied if and only if the canonical isomorphism 1 \u2192 1\u2217\u2217\nis the identity map.\nDefinition 4.5. We will call a weak Hopf algebra satisfying (12) regular.\nRemark 4.6. It was shown in [NV, 6.1] that every weak Hopf algebra can be\nobtained as a twisting of some regular weak Hopf algebra with the same algebra\nstructure.\n4.2. Integrals. The following notion of an integral in a weak Hopf algebra is a\ngeneralization of that of an integral in a usual Hopf algebra [M].\nDefinition 4.7 ([BNSz]). A left integral in A is an element l \u2208 A such that\n(13)\n\nhl = \u03b5t (h)l,\n\n(rh = r\u03b5s (h))\n\nfor all h \u2208 A.\n\nThe space of left integrals in A is a left ideal of A of dimension equal to dimk (At ).\nAny left integral \u03bb in A\u2217 satisfies the following invariance property :\n(14)\n\ng(1) \u03bb(hg(2) ) = S(h(1) )\u03bb(h(2) g),\n\ng, h \u2208 A.\n\nIn what follows we use the Sweedler arrows \u21c0 and \u21bc for the dual actions :\n(15)\n\nh \u21c0 \u03c6(g) = \u03c6(gh)\n\u2217\n\nand\n\n\u03c6 \u21bc h(g) = \u03c6(hg).\n\nfor all g, h \u2208 A, \u03c6 \u2208 A .\nRecall that a functional \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 is non-degenerate if \u03c6 \u25e6 m is a non-degenerate\nbilinear form on A. Equivalently, \u03c6 is non-degenerate if the linear map h 7\u2192 (h \u21c0 \u03c6)\nis injective. An integral (left or right) in a weak Hopf algebra A is called nondegenerate if it defines a non-degenerate functional on A\u2217 . A left integral l is called\nnormalized if \u03b5t (l) = 1.\nIt was shown by P. Vecsernyes [V] that a finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra\nalways possesses a non-degenerate left integral. In particular, a finite dimensional\n\n\f16\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nweak Hopf algebra is a Frobenius algebra (this extends the well-known result of\nLarson and Sweedler for usual Hopf algebras).\nMaschke's theorem for weak Hopf algebras, proved in [BNSz, 3.13], states that\na weak Hopf algebra A is semisimple if and only if A is separable, and if and only\nif there exists a normalized left integral in A. In particular, every semisimple weak\nHopf algebra is finite dimensional.\nFor a finite dimensional A there is a useful notion of duality between nondegenerate left integrals in A and A\u2217 [BNSz, 3.18]. If l is a non-degenerate left\nintegral in A then there exists a unique \u03bb \u2208 A\u2217 such that \u03bb \u21c0 l = 1. This \u03bb\nis a non-degenerate left integral in A\u2217 . Moreover, l \u21c0 \u03bb = \u01eb. Such a pair of\nnon-degenerate integrals (l, \u03bb) is called a pair of dual integrals.\nAn invertible element g \u2208 A is called group-like if \u2206(g) = (g \u2297g)\u2206(1) = \u2206(1)(g \u2297\ng) [N, Definition 4.1]. Group-like elements of A form a group G(A) under multiplication. This group has a normal subgroup G0 (A) := G(Amin ) of trivial group-like\ne\nelements. If A is finite dimensional, the quotient group G(A)\n= G(A)/G0 (A) is\nfinite. It was shown in [N] that if A is finite dimensional and l \u2208 A and \u03bb \u2208 A\u2217\nis a dual pair of left integrals, then there exist group-like elements \u03b1 \u2208 G(A\u2217 ) and\ne \u2217 ) and\na \u2208 G(A), called distinguished group-like elements, whose classes in G(A\ne\nG(A) do not depend on the choice of l and \u03bb, such that\n(16)\n\nS(l) = \u03b1 \u21c0 l\n\nand\n\nS(\u03bb) = a \u21c0 \u03bb.\n\n(Note that \u03b1 and a themselves depend on the choice of l and \u03bb).\nThe following result is crucial for this paper. It is an analogue of Radford's\nformula for usual Hopf algebras.\nTheorem 4.8. [N, Theorem 5.13] One has\n(17)\n\nS 4 (h) = a\u22121 (\u03b1 \u21c0 h \u21bc \u03b1\u22121 )a.\n\nfor all h \u2208 A.\nA weak Hopf algebra A is said to be unimodular if it contains a non-degenerate\n2-sided integral; equivalently, A is unimodular if the coset of \u03b1 in G(A\u2217 ) is trivial.\nA semisimple weak Hopf algebra is automatically unimodular [BNSz].\n4.3. Proof of Theorem 2.6. Let C be a fusion category over k. By Theorem 2.22,\nC is the representation category of a semisimple connected weak Hopf algebra A.\nSince A is semisimple, it is unimodular, and hence one can choose a left integral\nl such that the corresponding element \u03b1 = \u01eb. Thus, by Theorem 4.8, one has\nS 4 (h) = a\u22121 ha, for some group-like element a \u2208 G(H), and hence for any simple\nobject V \u2208 C = Rep(A), the operator a\u22121 |V defines an isomorphism V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 .\nSince a is grouplike, this isomorphism respects the tensor product. The theorem is\nproved.\n4.4. Canonical integrals. Using the squared antipode, one can construct integrals on a weak Hopf algebra A called the canonical integrals. Namely, we have the\nfollowing proposition, a particular case of which was proved in [BNSz].\nProposition 4.9. Let A be a finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebra and let {qi }\nbe primitive central idempotents in At . Then \u03c7i (h) := Tr(Lh \u25e6 S 2 |AS(qi ) ), where\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n17\n\nLh \u2208 Endk (A) is given by Lh (x) = hx, h, x \u2208 A, defines a left integral in A\u2217 such\nthat\n(18)\n\n\u03c7i (qj ) =\n\n(19)\n\n\u03c7i (gh) =\n\nTr(S 2 |qj AS(qi ) )\n\nand\n\n2\n\n\u03c7(hS (g)),\n\nfor all g, h \u2208 A.\nProof. The identities (18) and (19) follow immediately from the definition of \u03c7,\nsince A is regular and S 2 \u25e6 Lg = LS 2 (g) \u25e6 S 2 for all g \u2208 A.\nNext, for all \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 we define R\u03c6 \u2208 Endk (A) by R\u03c6 (x) = x \u21bc \u03c6, x \u2208 A\u2217 . Then\nR\u03c6 (xS(qi )) = R\u03c6 (x)S(qi ) so that AS(qi ) is R\u03c6 -invariant. A direct computation\nshows that L(h\u21bc\u03c6) = R\u03c6(1) \u25e6 Lh \u25e6 RS \u22121 (\u03c6(2) ) for all h \u2208 A, \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 , and hence,\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c7i )(\u2206(h))\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nTr(L(h\u21bc\u03c6) \u25e6 S 2 |AS(qi ) )\n\nTr(R\u03c6(1) \u25e6 Lh \u25e6 RS \u22121 (\u03c6(2) ) \u25e6 S 2 |AS(qi ) )\nTr(R\u03b5t (\u03c6) \u25e6 Lh \u25e6 S 2 |AS(qi ) ),\n\ntherefore, (id \u2297 \u03c7i )\u2206(h) = (\u03b5t \u2297 \u03c7)\u2206(h) for all h \u2208 A, i.e., \u03c7i is a left integral in\nA\u2217 .\n\u0003\n4.5. Sufficient conditions for semisimplicity. The next proposition is a refinement of [N, Proposition 6.4] and is analogous to the Larson-Radford theorem [LR1]\nfor usual Hopf algebras which says that if A is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra\nwith Tr(S 2 |A ) 6= 0 then A is semisimple and cosemisimple.\nProposition 4.10. Let A be a finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra. If for every\nprimitive idempotent p in At \u2229 Z(A) there exist idempotents qp , qp\u2032 in pAt such that\nTr(S 2 |qp AS(qp\u2032 ) ) 6= 0,\n\n(20)\nthen A is semisimple.\n\nProof. Let l and \u03bb be a dual pair of non-degenerate left integrals in A and A\u2217 respectively. Then (l(2) \u21c0 \u03bb)\u2297qp S \u22121 (l(1) )S(qp\u2032 ) is the dual bases tensor for qp AS(qp\u2032 ),\ncf. [N]. Therefore,\n0\n\n6= Tr(S 2 |qp AS(qp\u2032 ) )\n\n= h l(2) \u21c0 \u03bb, qp S(l(1) )S(qp\u2032 ) i\n\n= h \u03bb, qp \u03b5s (qp\u2032 l) i.\n\nTherefore, yp := \u03b5s (qp\u2032 l) 6= 0. Next, we compute\nyp l =\n\nS(l(1) )S(qp\u2032 )l(2) l\n\n=\n\nS(l(1) )S(qp\u2032 )\u03b5t (l(2) )l\n\n=\n\nS(l(1) )\u03b5t (l(2) )S(qp\u2032 )l = S(l)yp .\n\nLet \u03bep be an element in A\u2217t (here and below we write A\u2217t := (A\u2217 )t , A\u2217s := (A\u2217 )s )\nsuch that \u03bep \u21c0 1 = yp . Then from the previous computation we have\n(21)\n\nyp l = (\u03b1 \u21c0 l)yp ,\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a distinguished group-like element of A\u2217 . Arguing as in [N, Proposition\n6.4] one gets\n(22)\n\n\u03bep = S(\u03bep )\u03b1,\n\n\f18\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nwhence \u03b1 is trivial, i.e., \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217min . This means that one can choose l in such a\nway that \u03b1 = \u01eb, i.e., l = S(l). Hence,\nP yp \u2208 As \u2229 Z(A) is a non-zero multiple of\np. We conclude that y := \u03b5s (l) =\np yp is an invertible central element of A.\nHence, l\u2032 = y \u22121 l is a normalized right integral in A. By Maschke's theorem, A is\nsemisimple.\n\u0003\nLet q qnd q \u2032 be idempotents in At , and let \u03c1 = \u01eb \u21bc q and \u03c1\u2032 = \u01eb \u21bc q \u2032 . Then \u03c1\nand \u03c1\u2032 are idempotents in A\u2217t .\nLemma 4.11. The space \u03c1A\u2217 S(\u03c1\u2032 ) may be identified, in an S 2 -invariant way, with\nthe dual space of qAS(q \u2032 ).\nProof. It is easy to check that for all h \u2208 A and \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 one has h \u03c6, qhS(q \u2032 ) i =\nh \u03c1\u03c6S(\u03c1\u2032 ), h i, whence the statement follows.\n\u0003\nThe next three corollaries refine [N, Corollaries 6.5 - 6.7].\nCorollary 4.12. Let A be a finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra. If for every\nprimitive idempotent \u03c0 in A\u2217t \u2229 A\u2217s there exist idempotents \u03c1\u03c0 , \u03c1\u2032\u03c0 in \u03c0A\u2217t such that\nTr(S 2 |\u03c1\u03c0 A\u2217 S(\u03c1\u2032\u03c0 ) ) 6= 0,\n\n(23)\nthen A is semisimple.\n\nProof. This immediately follows from Proposition 4.10 and Lemma 4.11, since the\nlatter implies Tr(S 2 |\u03c1\u03c0 A\u2217 S(\u03c1\u2032\u03c0 ) ) = Tr(S 2 |qp AS(qp\u2032 ) ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.13. Let A be a connected finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra. If\nthere exist idempotents q, q \u2032 in At such that Tr(S 2 |qAS(q\u2032 ) ) 6= 0 then A is semisimple.\nCorollary 4.14. Let A be a biconnected finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra. If\nthere exist idempotents q, q \u2032 in At such that Tr(S 2 |qAS(q\u2032 ) ) 6= 0 then A and A\u2217 are\nsemisimple.\n5. Tr(S 2 ) and the global dimension\n5.1. Proof of Theorem 2.24. Let A be a connected semisimple weak Hopf algebra. Then C = Rep(A) is a fusion category. In particular, V \u2217\u2217 is isomorphic to V\nfor any simple object V , which means that S 2 is an inner automorphism of A (this\nis also proved in [BNSz, 3.22]). So let g \u2208 A be such that S 2 (x) = gxg \u22121 for all\nx \u2208 A. Then g|V : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 : v 7\u2192 g * v is an isomorphism of representations.\nThe calculation of TrV (g) and TrV ((g \u22121 )\u2217 ) yields\n(24)\n\nTrV (g)IdAt\n\n(25)\n\nTrV \u2217 ((g \u22121 )\u2217 )IdAt\n\n= Tr(S(g)1(1) |V \u2217 )1(2) ,\n= Tr(g \u22121 1(1) |V )1(2) .\n\nRemark 5.1. We note an important distinction between the quantum trace in an\nobject V of a morphism V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 , which is denoted by TrV , and the usual trace\nof a linear operator in the vector space V , which is denoted just by Tr.\nLet {qi } be primitive idempotents in Z(At ) and for every i let n2i = dimk (qi At )\n(i.e., ni is the dimension of the irreducible representation of At corresponding to\nqi ). Multiplying equations (24) and (25) on the right by qj and qi respectively,\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n19\n\napplying Tr|At , and using that for a regular weak Hopf algebra Tr(z|At ) = \u01eb(z) for\nall z \u2208 At [N], we get\nTrV (g)n2j = Tr(g|qj V ),\n\nTrV \u2217 ((g \u22121 )\u2217 )n2i = Tr(g \u22121 |S(qi )V ),\n\nand hence,\n(26)\n\nTr(g|qj V )Tr(g \u22121 |S(qi )V ) = |V |2 n2i n2j .\n\nTaking the sum over all isomorphism classes of simple V , we obtain :\n(27)\n\nTr(S 2 |qj AS(qi ) ) = dim(Rep(A))n2i n2j .\n\nThis proves the first statement of the theorem. The second one follows from Theorem 2.3. Theorem 2.24 is proved.\n5.2. Proof of Theorem 2.15. Let C be a fusion category, and let M be an inde\u2217\ncomposable module category over C. Let us show that CM\nis semisimple.\nChoose a semisimple algebra R with blocks labeled by simple objects of M. Let\nF be the fiber functor F : C \u2192 R \u2212 bimod associated with M, R as explained in\nSection 2. Let A = Endk (F ) be the corresponding weak Hopf algebra. Consider\n\u2217\nthe weak Hopf algebra A\u2217cop . The representation category of A\u2217cop is CM\n. Thus,\n\u2217cop\nA\nis connected (as M is indecomposable). So, A is biconnected. Also, by\nTheorem 2.24, we have Tr(S 2 |qj AS(qi ) ) = dim(C)n2i n2j 6= 0. Thus, by Corollary\n\u2217\n\u2217\n4.14, A\u2217cop , and hence CM\nis semisimple. The equality dim(C) = dim(CM\n) follows\nfrom Theorem 2.24 and Lemma 4.11 (noting that the block sizes corresponding to\nthe idempotents q and \u01eb \u21bc q are the same). Theorem 2.15 is proved.\n5.3. Proof of Theorem 2.16. Let M be a possibly decomposable module category over C. So M = \u2295Mj is a direct sum of indecomposable subcategories. Now\nfor each i choose semisimple algebras Ri with blocks labeled by simple objects of\nMi , and let R = \u2295Ri . Let F be the fiber functor C \u2192 R \u2212 bimod, associated\nto (M, R), and let B = Endk (F ) be the corresponding weak Hopf algebra. Then\nby Theorem 2.24 and Corollary 4.12 applied to A = B \u2217 , we find that B \u2217 is semi\u2217\nsimple. In other words, the the category CM\nis semisimple. This implies Theorem\n\u2217\n2.16, since the category FunC (M1 , M2 ) is contained in CM\n. Theorem 2.16 is\n1 \u2295M2\nproved.\n5.4. A refinement of Theorem 2.24. Let A be a connected, but not necessarily\ncoconnected, semisimple weak Hopf algebra. Let \u03c0i be the primitive idempotents\nin A\u2217s \u2229 Z(A\u2217 ), and let Aij \u2282 A be defined by A\u2217ij = \u03c0i A\u2217 S(\u03c0j ). It is easy to see\nthat Aij = pj Api , where pi are the primitive idempotents of As \u2229 At . In particular,\nAii are semisimple algebras.\nIn fact, for every i the algebra Aii has a natural structure of a biconnected weak\nHopf algebra, and its representation category Rep(Aii ) is equivalent to Rep(A) via\nthe usual Morita equivalence V \u2192 pi V , V \u2208 Rep(A). Indeed, this map is a tensor\nfunctor since \u2206(pi ) = (pi \u2297 pi )\u2206(1). To prove that it is an equivalence it suffices to\nshow that the central support p\u0302i of pi equals 1. From the formula for \u2206(pi ) above\nwe have \u2206(p\u0302i A) \u2282 p\u0302i A\u2297 p\u0302i A. But p\u02c6i A contains the matrix block q0 A corresponding\nto the trivial representation of A (which is irreducible since A is connected). Hence,\n\u2206(q0 A) \u2282 p\u0302i A \u2297 p\u0302i A and so p\u0302i = 1.\nLet qir be the primitive idempotents of Z(Arr ). Let n2ir = dim(qir (Arr )t ). We\nhave the following refinement of Theorem 2.24.\n\n\f20\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nTheorem 5.2. One has Tr(S 2 |qjr Ars S(qis ) ) = dim(Rep(A))n2jr n2is .\nProof. The proof is completely analogous to the proof of Theorem 2.24. Namely,\nlet g be an element of A such that gxg \u22121 = S 2 (x). Then pr gpr realizes S 2 in Arr .\nHence, as was shown in the proof of Theorem 2.24 for any V \u2208 Rep(A), one has\nTr(pr gpr |qir V ) = TrV (g)n2ir ,\n\nand\nTr(pr g \u22121 pr |S(qir )V ) = TrV ((g \u22121 )\u2217 )n2ir .\n\nNow, Ars = \u2295V ps V \u2297 (pr V )\u2217 , and S 2 |Ars = ps gps \u2297 (pr g \u22121 pr )\u2217 . Hence, taking the\nsum over all V , we arrive at the result.\n\u0003\n5.5. Proof of Proposition 2.17. Let C be an indecomposable multi-fusion category. Fix an index r and let M = \u2295i Cir . It is clear that M is an indecomposable\n\u2217\nop\nC-module category, and the category CM\n:= FunC (M, M) equals Crr\n.\nChoose a semisimple algebra R with blocks labeled by simple objects of M. Let\nRj be the two sided ideal in R whose blocks are labeled by simple objects of \u2295i Cij \u2282\nM. Let n2j = dim(Rj ). Let F be the corresponding fiber functor, and B = Endk (F )\nthe corresponding weak Hopf algebra, and let A = B \u2217 . Then A is connected and\nsemisimple. Therefore, by Theorem 5.2, Tr(S 2 |qjr Ars S(qis ) ) = dim(Rep(A))n2is n2jr .\nThus, using Lemma 4.11, we get\ndim(Crs )n2is n2jr\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nTr(S 2 |(\u01eb\u21bcqjr )A\u2217rs S(\u01eb\u21bcqis ) )\nTr(S 2 |qjr Ars S(qis ) )\n\ndim(Rep(A))n2is n2jr ,\n\nso dim(Crs ) = dim(Rep(A)), as desired.\n5.6. Proof of Theorem 2.18. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that\nthe multi-fusion category C is indecomposable. Let M1 , M2 be module categories\nover C. Let 1i be the simple constituents of the unit object of C. Then it is shown\nin the standard way that for each i, the restriction functor FunC (M1 , M2 ) \u2192\nFunCi (1i M1 , 1i M2 ) is an equivalence of categories (one can construct a quasiinverse functor by extending a functor from 1i M1 to 1j M1 by tensoring with\nobjects of Cij and checking various compatibilities). Therefore, the result follows\nfrom Theorem 2.16.\n5.7. Surjective and injective functors. Let C, D be multi-fusion categories, and\nF : C \u2192 D be a unital tensor functor.\nWe will say that F is injective if it is fully faithful (in this case F identifies C\nwith a full tensor subcategory of D). We will say that F is surjective if any simple\nobject X of D is contained in an object of the form F (T ), T \u2208 C. If F is surjective\nand C,D are indecomposable, then D is said to be a quotient category of C.\nNow let M be a faithful module category over D. Then it is also a faithful\nmodule category over C. Let R be a semisimple algebra with blocks labeled by\nsimple objects of M, and G the corresponding fiber functor D \u2192 R-bimod. Let\nA = Endk (G), B = Endk (G \u25e6 F ) be the corresponding weak Hopf algebras. Then\nthe functor F induces a morphism of weak Hopf algebras \u03c6F : A \u2192 B, and vice\nversa. It is easy to check that F is surjective, respectively injective if and only if\n\u03c6F is injective, respectively surjective.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n21\n\nLet us now consider the corresponding dual categories C \u2217 , D\u2217 (we will drop the\nsubscript M, since the only module category we will consider in this subsection will\nbe M). We have a natural dual functor F \u2217 : D\u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 , since any D-linear functor\n\u03a6 : M \u2192 M has a natural C-linear structure, defined using F . It is clear that the\nmorphism \u03c6F \u2217 : B \u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 is given by \u03c6F \u2217 = \u03c6\u2217F .\nProposition 5.3. Let F : C \u2192 D be a unital tensor functor between multi-fusion\ncategories. If F is surjective (injective) then F \u2217 is injective (surjective).\nProof. The claim is equivalent to the statement that surjectivity of \u03c6F is equivalent\n\u0003\nto injectivity of \u03c6\u2217F , and vice versa, which is obvious.\n5.8. The induction functor and the class equation for fusion categories.\nIn\nP\nfinite group theory, an important role is played by the \"class equation\" s |G1s | = 1,\nwhere the summation is over conjugacy classes of a finite group G, and Gs are the\ncorresponding centralizers. There is a similar formula for semisimple Hopf algebras\n(due to G.I.Kac and Y.Zhu, see [Ka], [Zhu]), which is also very useful. Here we will\nprove a class equation for any fusion category, which generalizes the results of Kac\nand Zhu.\nLet C be a fusion category. Let I : C \u2192 Z(C) be the induction functor, defined\nby the condition HomZ(C) (I(V ), X) = HomC (V, X), V \u2208 C, X \u2208 Z(C).\nLet [X : Y ] denote the multiplicity of a simple object Y in an object X.\nFor X \u2208 Z(C), let X|C denote the corresponding object of C. Then I(V ) =\n\u2295X\u2208Irr(Z(C))[X|C : V ]X.\nProposition 5.4. One has I(V )|C = \u2295Y \u2208Irr(C) Y \u2297 V \u2297 Y \u2217 .\nExample 5.5. If G is a finite group and C = Rep(G), then I(1) is the following\nrepresentation of the quantum double D(G) = C[G] \u22c9 O(G): it is the regular\nrepresentation of the function algebra O(G), on which G acts by conjugation. In\nthis case proposition 5.4 for trivial V is the standard fact that for conjugation\naction, O(G) = \u2295Y \u2208Irrep(G) Y \u2297 Y \u2217 .\nProof. Let C = Rep(A), where A is a weak Hopf algebra. Then Z(C) = Rep(D(A)),\nwhere D(A) is the quantum double of A (see [NTV]). As a space, D(A) = A\u2217 \u2297Amin\nA. So we have I(V )|C = D(A) \u2297A V = A\u2217 \u2297Amin V , with the action of A defined\nby h(\u03c6 \u2297 v) = h(3) \u21c0 \u03c6 \u21bc S(h(1) ) \u2297 h(2) v for all h \u2208 A, \u03c6 \u2208 A\u2217 , v \u2208 V . This\nyields exactly \u2295Y \u2208Irr(C) Y \u2297 V \u2297 Y \u2217 , where the tensor product is taken in the\nrepresentation category of A. The proposition is proved.\n\u0003\nP\nProposition 5.6. The number X\u2208Irr(Z(C)) [X|C : 1]2 is equal to the number of\nsimple objects of C.\nProof. This sum equals dim End(I(1)), which is the same as [I(1)|C : 1]. But by\nProposition 5.4 we know that I(1)|C = \u2295Y \u2208Irr(C) Y \u2297 Y \u2217 , so the result follows. \u0003\nProposition 5.7. (The class equation) Let C be a spherical fusion category. Then\none has\nX\n1\n= 1,\n[X|C : 1]\nmX\nX\u2208Irr(Z(C)):[X|C :1]6=0\n\nwhere mX =\n\ndim C\ndim X\n\nis an algebraic integer.\n\n\f22\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nProof. The proposition is immediately obtained by computing the dimension of I(1)\nin two ways. On the one hand,Pthis dimension is equal to dim C by Proposition 5.4.\nOn the other hand, it equals [X|C : 1] dim X. The fact that mX is an algebraic\ninteger follows from Proposition 3.3. The proposition is proved.\n\u0003\nExample 5.8. Let C = Rep(G). In this case Z(C) = RepD(G), so simple objects are parametrized by pairs (conjugacy class, irreducible representation of the\ncentralizer). The simple objects X \u2208 Z(C) for which X|C contains 1 are exactly\nthose for which the representation of the centralizer is trivial. Thus, the equation\nof Proposition 5.7 is exactly the class equation for G.\n5.9. Graded categories. Let G be a finite group.\nDefinition 5.9. A G-grading on a tensor category C is a decomposition C =\n\u2295g\u2208G Cg , such that \u2297 : Cg \u00d7 Ch \u2192 Cgh , 1 \u2208 Ce , and \u2217 : Cg \u2192 Cg\u22121 . We will\nsay that the grading is faithful if Cg 6= 0 for any g \u2208 G.\nIt is clear that if C is a G-graded category, then Ce is a tensor category, and Cg\nare left and right module categories over Ce .\nLet C be a fusion category, G a finite abelian group.\nProposition 5.10. Suppose that Z(C) contains, as a full tensor subcategory, the\ncategory of modules G\u0303 over O(G), and that all simple objects of this subcategory\nmap to the neutral object of C under the functor Z(C) \u2192 C. Then C admits a\nfaithful G\u2228 -grading (where G\u2228 is the dual group to G).\nProof. Let g \u2208 G\u0303 be a simple object. Since g is trivial as an object of C, it defines a\ntensor automorphism of the identity functor of C. Thus we have a homomorphism\nG \u2192 Aut\u2297 (Id), and hence any simple object of C defines an element of the dual\ngroup G\u2228 . This is obviously a faithful grading.\n\u0003\n5.10. Deformations of weak Hopf algebras. It is well known that a nonsemisimple finite dimensional algebra can be perturbed into a semisimple one.\nHowever, for (connected) weak Hopf algebras the situation is different. Namely,\nwe have the following result.\nProposition 5.11. Let Ht be a continuous family of finite dimensional regular\nconnected weak Hopf algebras over C depending of a real parameter t \u2208 (a, b) (i.e.,\nHt is independent of t as a vectors space, and the structure maps continuously\ndepend on t). Then either Ht is semisimple for all t or Ht is non-semisimple for\nall t.\nProof. The set U \u2282 (a, b) where Ht is semisimple is open. Assume that this set\nis nonempty. The function f (t) = Tr(S 2 |Ht ) is a continuous function of t. By\nCorollary 4.13, f is zero on the complement U c of U . Also, by Theorem 2.3 and\nRemark 2.25, f is a nonzero algebraic integer for any t \u2208 U . Since f is continuous,\nthis implies that f is constant (and nonzero) on each connected component of U .\nThus, U c is empty. We are done.\n\u0003\n5.11. Sphericity of pivotalization. In this Section we allow the ground field to\nhave a positive characteristic, different from 2.\nLet A be a quasitriangular weak Hopf algebra, i.e., such that Rep(A) is a braided\nmonoidal category. Let R \u2208 (A \u2297 A)\u2206(1) be the R-matrix of A. It was shown in\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n23\n\n[NTV] that the Drinfeld element u = S(R(2) )R(1) is invertible, satisfies S 2 (h) =\nuhu\u22121 for all h in A, and\n(28)\n\n\u2206(u\u22121 ) = R21 R(u\u22121 \u2297 u\u22121 ).\n\nFurthermore, the element uS(u)\u22121 is group-like and implements S 4 via the adjoint\naction.\nObserve that for any group-like element \u03b7 \u2208 G(A\u2217 ) the element g\u03b7 = R(1) h \u03b7, R(2) i\nis group-like in A and the map \u03b7 7\u2192 g\u03b7 is a group homomorphism from G(A\u2217 ) to\nG(Aop ).\nRecall that distingusihed elments of A and A\u2217 were defined in Section 4.2. In the\nnext Lemma we extend a result of Radford [R2] relating the distinguished elements\nand uS(u)\u22121 .\nLemma 5.12. Let a \u2208 A and \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217 be a pair of distinguished group-like elements\nchosen as in Section 4.2. Then g\u03b1 a = S(u)u\u22121 .\nProof. Let l \u2208 A be a non-degenerate integral from which a and \u03b1 are constructed.\nIt follows from [N, Section 5] that\nl(2) \u2297 l(1)\n\nl(1) h \u2297 l(2)\n\n= l(1) \u2297 S 2 (l(2) )a\u22121\n\n= l(1) \u2297 l(2) S(h \u21bc \u03b1),\n\nh \u2208 A.\n\nUsing these identities and properties of integrals and R-matrices we compute\nl(2) S(R(2) \u21bc \u03b1)R(1) \u2297 l(1)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nl(2) R(1) \u2297 l(1) R(2)\n\nR(1) l(1) \u2297 R(2) l(2)\n\nR(1) S(R(2) )l(1) \u2297 l(2)\n\nR(1) S(R(2) )S 2 (l(2) )a\u22121 \u2297 l(1) ,\n\nwhence S(R(2) \u21bc \u03b1)R(1) = R(1) S(R(2) )a\u22121 = S(u)a\u22121 by non-degeneracy of l.\nOn the other hand, from the axioms of R-matrix we have S(R(2) \u21bc \u03b1)R(1) =\nS(R(2) )R(1) g\u03b1 = ug\u03b1 , which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRecall [NTV, Section 7] that a central \u03bd \u2208 A is a ribbon element if \u03bd = S(\u03bd) and\n\u2206(\u03bd) = R21 R(\u03bd \u2297 \u03bd). A quasitriangular weak Hopf algebra A has a ribbon element\nif and only if Rep(A) is a ribbon category.\nCorollary 5.13. Suppose that A is a unimodular quasitriangular weak Hopf algebra\nand that \u03b1 is gauged to be \u01eb. If g \u2208 A is a group-like element such that g 2 = a\u22121\nand S 2 (h) = ghg \u22121 for all h \u2208 A then \u03bd = u\u22121 g is a ribbon element of A.\n\nProof. In this case we have g\u03b1 = 1. Since both u and g implement S 2 , the element\n\u03bd is central. It follows from Equation (28) that \u2206(\u03bd) = R21 R(\u03bd \u2297 \u03bd). Finally,\nS(\u03bd) = S(u)\u22121 g \u22121 = u\u22121 g = \u03bd by Lemma 5.12.\n\u0003\nRecall that in Remark 3.1, it was shown that to every fusion category C one can\n \u0303 which has a canonical pivotal structure.\nassociate a twice bigger fusion category C,\nProposition 5.14. If dim C 6= 0 then the canonical pivotal stucture of the category\nC \u0303 is in fact a spherical structure.\n\nProof. Let us realize C \u0303 as the representation category of a regular weak Hopf algebra\nA. In this case, the pivotal structure of C \u0303 is defined by a grouplike element g \u2208 A,\nsuch that g 2 = a\u22121 , where a is the distinguished group-like element of A. Assume\n\n\f24\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nthat the distinguished group-like element \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217 is gauged to be \u01eb. Consider the\n \u0303 i.e., the representation category of the Drinfeld double D(A).\nDrinfeld center Z(C),\nOne can check that a is also the distinguished grouplike element for D(A). Since\ng is a grouplike element such that gxg \u22121 = S 2 (x) for x \u2208 D(A), and g 2 = a\u22121 , it\n \u0303 is ribbon.\nfollows from Corollary 5.13 that D(A) is ribbon, hence, Z(C)\n \u0303 [K]. Hence, the same holds in C \u0303 (i.e., C \u0303\nThus, we have dim(V ) = dim(V \u2217 ) in Z(C)\n \u0303 be the induction functor defined in subsection\nis spherical). Indeed, let I : C \u0303 \u2192 Z(C)\n \u0303 I(V ) = \u2295\n5.8.

In any pivotal fusion category C over C, the dimension of a simple\nobject is a positive number times a root of unity.\n\n \u0303 It has two pivotal structures b1 , b2 : V \u2192 V \u2217\u2217 .\nProof. Consider the category C.\nNamely, b1 comes from C and b2 is the canonical pivotal structure. By Proposition\n5.14, b2 is spherical. On the other hand, b\u22121\n2 \u25e6 b1 is a tensor endomorphism of the\nidentity functor, which obviously acts by roots of unity on simple objects. This\nimplies the statement.\n\u0003\n\n6. The co-Hochschild complex of a cosemisimple unimodular weak\nHopf algebra and its subcomplex of invariants\n6.1. The definition. Let A be a weak Hopf algebra and let B \u2282 A be a weak Hopf\nsubalgebra. We will define a complex C \u2022 (A, B) that generalizes the subcomplex of\nthe co-Hochschild complex of a Hopf algebra consisting of invariants of the adjoint\naction, cf.

The Yetter cohomology of a tensor category and Ocneanu\nrigidity\n7.1. The definition. The following cohomology of a tensor category with respect\nto a tensor functor was defined in [Y1, Y2], motivated by the previous work [CY],\nand independently in [Da].\nLet C, C \u2032 be tensor categories over a field k, and F : C \u2192 C \u2032 be a (unital) tensor\nfunctor.\nFor a nonnegative integer n, let C n denote the n-th Cartesian power of C. In\nparticular, C 0 has one object (empty tuple \u2205) and one morphism (identity). Define\nthe functor Tn : C n \u2192 C by Tn (X1 , ..., Xn ) := X1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn . In particular, T0 :\nC 0 \u2192 C is defined by T0 (\u2205) = 1, and T1 = Id. Let CFn (C) = End(Tn \u25e6 F \u2297n ) (so e.g.,\nCF0 (C) = End(1C \u2032 )). We define a differential d : C n (C) \u2192 C n+1 (C) by the formula\ndf = Id\u2297f2,...,n+1\u2212f12,...,n+1 +f1,23,...,n+1\u2212...+(\u22121)n f1,...,nn+1 +(\u22121)n+1 f1,...,n\u2297Id,\n\nwhere for instance f12,3,...,n+1 is the endomorphism of the product of n objects\nF (X1 )\u2297F (X2 ), F (X3 ), ..., F (Xn+1 ), and we use the identification F (X1 )\u2297F (X2 ) \u2192\nF (X1 \u2297 X2 ) defined by the tensor structure on F .\nIt is easy to show that d2 = 0. Thus (C \u2022 (C), d) is a complex. We will call the\ncohomology groups HFn (C), n \u2265 0 of this complex the Yetter cohomology groups of\nC with respect to F . In the important special case C = C \u2032 , F = Id, we will denote\nthis cohomology simply by H i (C) and call it the Yetter cohomology of C.\nAs usual, low dimensional Yetter cohomology groups have an independent meaning [Y1, Y2, Da]. The group HF1 (C) classifies derivations of F as a tensor functor.\nThe group HF2 (C) classifies first order deformations of the tensor structure on the\nfunctor F . The group H 3 (C) classifies first order defomations of the associativity\nconstraint in C, i.e. of the structure of C itself. As usual, obstructions to these\ndeformations live in the cohomology groups one degree higher.\nTo illustrate this definition, we give a few examples.\nExample 7.1. If C is Rep(H) for a Hopf algebra H and F the forgetful functor,\nthen HFi (C) is the usual Hochschild cohomology of H as a coalgebra.\n\n\f28\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nExample 7.2. Let G be a finite group, and C = VecG be the category of G-graded\nvector spaces over an algebraically closed field k (of any characteristic). Then\nH i (C) = H i (O(G)), the Hochschild cohomology of O(G) as a coalgebra, where O(G)\nis the Hopf algebra of k-valued functions on G. In other words, H i (C) = H i (G, k),\nthe group cohomology of G with coefficients in k.\nExample 7.3. Let G be a reductive algebraic group over k with Lie algebra\ng. Let Rep(G) denote the category of algebraic representations of G. Then\nH i (Rep(G)) = (\u039bi g)G for all i. Indeed, Rep(G) = Rep(O(G)\u2217 ). Therefore,\nC n (Rep(G)) = (O(Gn )\u2217 )G , where G acts diagonally by conjugation. Since G is\nreductive, the cohomology of this complex is the G-invariants in the Hochschild\ncohomology of O(G) with coefficients in the trivial representation (corresponding\nto 1 \u2208 G). This cohomology is well known to be \u039bg, so the answer is (\u039bg)G , as\ndesired. Thus, if g is a simple Lie algebra, then there is no nontrivial derivations or\ntensor structure deformations of the identity functor, but there exists a unique (up\nto scaling) first order deformation of the associativity constraint, corresponding to\na basis element in (\u039b3 g)G . It is easy to guess that this deformation comes from an\nactual deformation, namely from the deformation of O(G) to the quantum group\nOq (G).\n7.2. Comparison of two complexes. The following proposition shows that for\ncategories and functors coming from weak Hopf algebras, the Yetter complex defined\nhere is the same as the complex defined in the previous section.\nProposition 7.4. Let A be a weak Hopf algebra, B a weak Hopf subalgebra in A,\nC = Rep(A), C \u2032 = Rep(B), and F : C \u2192 C \u2032 be the restriction functor. Then the\ncomplex CF\u2022 (C) coincides with the complex C \u2022 (A, B) defined in Section 6.\nProof. Let us show that End(Tn \u25e6 F \u2297n ) = C n (A, B). For this, define a map \u03be :\nC n (A, B) \u2192 End(Tn ). Recall that for any representations X1 , ..., Xn of A, the\nrepresentation X1 \u2297C ... \u2297C Xn is defined to be the image of the projection \u2206n (1)\nacting on X1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn [NTV]. Therefore, any element a \u2208 C n (A, B) defines an\noperator on the usual tensor product X1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn which preserves the subspace\nX1 \u2297C ... \u2297C Xn (since a = Ad(1)a). Let us denote by \u03be(a) its restriction to this\nsubspace. Since a is invariant under the adjoint action, we find that \u03be(a) is not\nonly a linear map but also a morphism of representations. So we have defined the\nmap \u03be.\nNow we need to show that the map \u03be is an isomorphism. For this purpose, we\nconstruct the inverse map. Take f \u2208 End(Tn \u25e6 F \u2297n ). Extend it by zero to the\nspace Ker\u2206n (1) in X1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn . Then we get a linear operator f \u0303 on X1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn ,\nwhich is functorial in X1 , ..., Xn . Thus, f \u0303 corresponds to a unique element f\u02c6 of\nA\u2297n . It is clear that f\u02c6 = Ad(1)f\u02c6, since both sides define the same operators in\nX1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Xn . It is also clear that f\u02c6 is invariant under adjoint action, as f is a\nd = a. Thus, \u03be\nmorphism in the category. Finally, it is clear that \u03be(f\u02c6) = f , and \u03be(a)\nis an isomorphism.\nFinally, it is easy to see that the map \u03be identifies the differentials of the two\ncomplexes. The proposition is proved.\n\u0003\n7.3. Proof of Theorem 2.27 and Theorem 2.30. Let C, C \u2032 be multifusion categories, and F : C \u2192 C \u2032 a tensor functor between them. We can assume without loss\nof generality that F is faithful and surjective. Let R be a semisimple algebra, and\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n29\n\nlet G : C \u2032 \u2192 R \u2212 bimod be a fiber functor on C \u2032 (we know by now that it necessarily\nexists for a suitable R). Let B = End(G) be the corresponding weak Hopf algebra.\nLet A = End(G \u25e6 F ). Then B is a weak Hopf subalgebra of A, C \u2032 = Rep(B),\nC = Rep(A), and F is the restriction functor. Thus, by Proposition 7.4, the complex CF\u2022 (C) is isomorphic to the complex C \u2022 (A, B). Now, since A is semisimple, it\nis also cosemisimple by Theorem 2.26. Hence, by Theorem 6.3, CF\u2022 (C) is acyclic in\npositive degrees. Theorem 2.27 is proved.\nNow let us prove Theorem 2.30. Let C be a multifusion category. By theorem\n2.27, we have H i (C) = 0, i > 0, in particular H 3 (C) = 0.\nNow consider the set of all admissible associativity constraints for a tensor category with the same Grothendieck ring as C. It is an affine algebraic variety. This\nvariety is acted upon by the group of twists. By a standard argument, one finds\nthat the quotient of the tangent space to this variety at the point C by the tangent\nspace to the orbit of C is equal to H 3 (C). Since H 3 (C) = 0, the group action is\nlocally transitive, and hence has finitely many orbits. We are done.\nIn conclusion we give the formulation of Ocneanu rigidity for semisimple weak\nHopf algebras. This is a generalization to the weak case of Stefan's rigidity theorem\nfor semisimple Hopf algebras [S], which was conjectured in [N, 3.9].\nTheorem 7.5. A regular semisimple finite dimensional weak Hopf algebra does\nnot admit nontrivial deformations in the class of regular weak Hopf algebras. In\nparticular, there are finitely many such weak Hopf algebras in each dimension.\nProof. Let A be a regular semisimple weak Hopf algebra, Rep(A) its representation\ncategory, R its base, and let F : Rep(A) \u2192 R \u2212 bimod be the forgetful functor.\nSuppose we have a deformation of A. Then by Theorem 2.30, this deformation\nproduces a trivial deformation of Rep(A) as a tensor category. It is also clear that\nthe base R of A, being a semisimple algebra, is deformed trivially. This means\nthat this deformation comes from a deformation of the forgetful functor F as a\ntensor functor (indeed, a regular weak Hopf algebra is completely determined by\nthe associated forgetful functor, since the symmetric separability idempotent is\nunique). But the deformation of F must also be trivial, by Theorem 2.31. This\nimplies the first statement of the theorem. The second statement follows from the\nfirst one as in the proof of Theorem 2.30.\n\u0003\n8. Frobenius-Perron dimensions\nIn this section we will give some applications of the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nto the theory of fusion categories. We work with categories over C.\n8.1. Definition of the Frobenius-Perron dimensions. We start by recalling\nthe Frobenius-Perron theorem (see [Ga]).\nTheorem 8.1. Let A be a square matrix with nonnegative entries.\n(1) A has a nonnegative real eigenvalue. The largest nonnegative real eigenvalue\n\u03bb(A) of A dominates absolute values of all other eigenvalues of A.\n(2) If A has strictly positive entries then \u03bb(A) is a simple positive eigenvalue,\nand the corresponding eigenvector can be normalized to have strictly positive\nentries.\n(3) If A has an eigenvector f with strictly positive entries, then the corresponding eigenvalue is \u03bb(A).\n\n\f30\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nNow let A be a unital based ring of finite rank in the sense of Lusztig (see, e.g.,\n[O] for a definition). Let bi be the basis of A (b0 = 1), and [bi ] be the matrix of\nmultiplication by bi \u2208 A in the basis bj . This matrix has nonnegative entries. Let\n\u03bbi be the largest nonnegative eigenvalue of [bi ]. Since bi is clearly not nilpotent,\nthis eigenvalue is actually positive.\nWe will call \u03bbi the Frobenius-Perron dimension of bi . We note that FrobeniusPerron dimensions for commutative based rings were defined and used in the book\n[FK].\nTheorem 8.2. The assignment bi \u2192 \u03bbi extends to a homomorphism of algebras\nA \u2192 R.\nP\nProof. For any j define zj = i bi bj b\u2217i . We claim that zj is central. Indeed, let\nP\n\u2217\nk\n= Nki \u2217 r , so\nbi bj = k Nijk bk . Then Nri\nX\nX\nX \u2217\nX\nk\nbr zj = br\nbi bj b\u2217i =\nNri\nbk bj b\u2217i =\nNki \u2217 r bk bj bi\u2217 =\nbk bj bk \u2217 br = zj br .\ni\n\nk,i\n\nk,i\n\nk\n\nP\nLet z = j zj . Since zj contain bj as a summand, the matrix [z] of multiplication\nP\nby z = j zj has strictly positive entries. Let f be the unique eigenvector of [z]\nwith positive entries and f0 = 1 (its existence and uniqueness follows from the\nFrobenius-Perron theorem). Then [bj ]f must be a multiple of f , since f has positive\nentries and [z][bj ] = [bj ][z]. So by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, [bj ]f = \u03bbj f ,\nwhence the statement follows.\n\u0003\nWe note that bi \u2192 \u03bbi is the unique homomorphism of A to R such that images\nof the basis vectors are positive. This is demonstrated by the following simple and\nprobably well known lemma.\nLet A be a Z+ -ring of finite rank with Z+ -basis bi (see [O] for definition).\nLemma 8.3. If there exists a homomorphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 R such that \u03c6(bi ) > 0 for\nall i, then \u03c6 is unique.\nProof. Let [bi ] be the matrix of multiplication by bi in the basis bj , and f be the\ncolumn vector with entries \u03c6(bj ). Then [bi ]f = \u03c6(bi )f . But [bi ] is a matrix with\nnonnegative entries, and f has positive entries. Thus, by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, \u03c6(bi ) is the largest positive eigenvalue of [bi ], and hence is uniquely determined.\nLemma is proved.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.4. M. M\u00fcger pointed out to us that for any i one has \u03bbi \u2265 1; moreover\nif \u03bbi < 2 then \u03bbi = 2 cos(\u03c0/n) for some integer n \u2265 3 (this follows from the well\nknown Kronecker theorem on the eigenvalues of positive integer matrices).\nOne can also define the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of basis elements of a based\nmodule over a unital based ring. Indeed, let M be an indecomposable based Amodule with basis mj (see [O] for definition).\nProposition 8.5. There exists a unique up to scaling common eigenvector m of\nthe matrices [bi ]|M of the operators bi in M , which has strictly positive entries. The\ncorresponding eigenvalues are \u03bbi .\nProof. Let z be the element from the proof of Theorem 8.2. The matrix [z]|M has\nstrictly positive entries. Let m be an eigenvector of [z]|M with positive entries.\nIt exists and is unique up to a positive scalar, by the Frobenius-Perron theorem.\nHence, it is an eigenvector of [bi ]|M , and the eigenvalues are \u03bbi by Lemma 8.3. \u0003\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n31\n\nNow let C be a fusion category. Let K(C) be the Grothendieck ring of C. For\nany object X \u2208 C, define the Frobenius-Perron dimension of X, FPdim(X), to be\nthe largest positive eigenvalue of the matrix [X] of multiplication by X in K(C).\nSince K(C) is a unital based ring of finite rank, Theorem 8.2 implies the following\nresult.\nTheorem 8.6. The assignment X \u2192 FPdim(X) extends to a homomorphism of\nalgebras K(C) \u2192 R.\nSimilarly, one can define Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects of a\nmodule category over a fusion category. Namely, let M be an indecomposable\nmodule category over a fusion category C. For any X \u2208 C let [X]M be the matrix\nof action of X on the Grothendieck group of M. Since the Grothendieck group\nK(M) is an indecomposable based module over K(C), Proposition 8.5 implies\nProposition 8.7. There exists a unique up to scaling common eigenvector m of the\nmatrices [X]M , which has strictly positive entries. The corresponding eigenvalues\nare FPdim(X).\nThe entries \u03bci of m are called the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects\nMi of M. Unlike Frobenius-Perron dimensions of objects of C, they are well defined\nonly up to scaling.\n8.2. Frobenius-Perron dimension of a fusion category. Let C be a fusion\ncategory. Define the Frobenius-Perron dimension FPdim(C) of C to be the sum of\nsquares of Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects of C.\nAlso, define the regular representation RC to be the (virtual) object\n\u2295X\u2208Irr(C)FPdim(X)X, where Irr(C) is the set of isomorphism classes of simple\nobjects of C. It is clear that FPdim(C) = FPdim(RC ).\nProposition 8.8. Let F : C \u2192 D be a surjective tensor functor between fusion\nFPdim(C)\nRD .\ncategories. Then F (RC ) = FPdim(D)\nProof. Let X be an object of C such that F (X) contains all simple objects of D.\nIt exists since F is surjective. The vectors of multiplicities of F (RC ) and RD are\neigenvectors of the matrix of multiplication by F (X). The matrix and the vectors\nhave strictly positive entries. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem, this implies that\nF (RC ) and RD differ by a positive scalar. This scalar is readily found to be the\nclaimed one by taking FPdim of F (RC ) and RD .\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.9. Let A \u2282 B be an inclusion of finite dimensional semisimple quasiHopf algebras. Then B is free as a left A-module.\nProof. In this case Frobenius-Perron dimensions coincide with the usual ones, so if\nC = Rep(B), D = Rep(A) then RC = B, RD = A, proving the claim.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.10. For Hopf algebras, Corollary 8.9 is the well known freeness theorem\nof Nichols and Zoeller [NZ] (it is true in the nonsemisimple case as well). In the\nquasi-Hopf case it was independently obtained by P. Schauenburg (without the\nsemisimplicity assumption), [Scha].\nCorollary 8.11. If F : C \u2192 D is surjective then FPdim(C) is divisible by FPdim(D)\n(i.e. the ratio is an algebraic integer).\n\n\f32\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nProof. Taking the multiplicity of the neutral object of D in Proposition 8.8, we find\nP\nFPdim(C)\n\u0003\nX\u2208Irr(C) FPdim(X)[F (X) : 1] = FPdim(D) , which yields the statement.\nProposition 8.12. For any fusion category C, one has FPdim(Z(C)) = FPdim(C)2 .\nRemark 8.13. If C is a representation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra A, then\nProposition 8.12 is saying that the Frobenius-Perron dimension of Z(C) is dim(A)2 .\nThis is a simple consequence of the result of Hausser and Nill [HN], who constructed\na quasi-Hopf algebra D(A) (the double of A), isomorphic to A \u2297 A\u2217 as a vector\nspace, such that Z(C) = Rep(D(A)).\nProof. Recall from Section 5 that V \u2192 I(V ) denotes the induction functor. By\nProposition 5.4, we have\nFPdim(I(V ))\n\n= \u2295X\u2208Irr(Z(C)) FPdim(X)[I(V ) : X]\n\n= \u2295X\u2208Irr(Z(C)) FPdim(X)[X|C : V ]\n= [RZ(C) : V ] =\n\nFPdimZ(C)\nFPdimZ(C)\n[RC : V ] =\nFPdim(V ).\nFPdimC\nFPdimC\n\nIn particular, FPdim(I(1)) = FPdimZ(C)\nFPdimC .\nOn the other hand, by Proposition 5.4, I(1) = \u2295Y \u2208Irr(C) Y \u2297 Y \u2217 , which implies\nthe desired statement (since the dimension of the right hand side is FPdim(C)).\nThe proposition is proved.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.14. Let C be a fusion category and C \u2217 be its dual with respect to an\nindecomposable module category. Then FPdim(C) = FPdim(C \u2217 ).\nProof. This follows from Proposition 8.12 and the fact that Z(C) is equivalent to\nZ(C \u2217 ) [O1, Mu2].\n\u0003\nProposition 8.15. Let C be a full tensor subcategory of a fusion category D. Then\nFPdim(D)/FPdim(C) is an algebraic integer.\nProof. Consider the decomposition of D, as a left module category over C, in a\ndirect sum of indecomposables. We have D = \u2295ri=1 Mr . Let us consider the duals\nof C and D with respect to this module category. We have D\u2217 = Dop , and C \u2217 is a\n\u2217\n\u2217\n, where Cij\n:= Fun(Mj , Mi ). Note that the\nmulti-fusion category C \u2217 = \u2295ri,j=1 Cij\n\u2217\nFrobenius-Perron dimensions of Cii are equal to FPdim(C) by Corollary 8.14.\n\u2217\nLet Eij denote nonzero virtual objects of Cij\n, which satisfy the condition\n\u2217\nX \u2297 Eij \u2297 Y = FPdim(X)FPdim(Y )Eij , X \u2208 Cii\u2217 , Y \u2208 Cjj\n. Since the category\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nCij is an indecomposable bimodule over Cii and Cjj , by the Frobenius-Perron theorem, the object Eij is unique up to scaling. We require that the coefficients in Eij\nbe positive, which determines it uniquely up to a positive scalar.\nTo fix the scaling completely, we will require that Eii , which is a multiple of the\nregular representation Rii in Cii\u2217 , be actually equal to FPdim(C)\u22121 Rii . Further, we\nnormalize E1j arbitrarily, then normalize Ej1 by the condition Ej1 \u2297 E1j = Ejj ,\nand finally define Ejk as Ej1 \u2297 E1k . It is easy to see that Eij satisfy the matrix\nunit relations Eij \u2297 Ekl = \u03b4jk Eil .\nNow let F : D\u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 be the natural functor, R be the regular representation\nof D\u2217 , and consider F (R) \u2208 C \u2217 . We claim that F (R) = \u2295i,j bij Eij , where bij > 0.\nIndeed, F (R)\u22972 = FPdim(D)F (R), so for any i the virtual object Li := \u2295j bij Eij is\nan eigen-object of the functor of right multiplication by F (R). Since the category\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n33\n\n\u2217\n\u2295j Cij\nis an indecomoposable right module over C \u2217 , by the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nsuch eigen-object with positive coefficients is unique up to scaling. Thus, for any\nX \u2208 Cii\u2217 , X \u2297Li = c(X)Li , where c(X) is a scalar. By the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nc(X) = FPdim(X). Similarly, Pj := \u2295i bij Eij satisfies Pj \u2297 X = FPdim(X)Pj ,\n\u2217\nX \u2208 Cjj\n. This implies the claim.\nNow let B be the matrix (bij ). Since F (R)\u22972 = FPdim(D)F (R), and Eij behave\nlike matrix units, we have B 2 = FPdim(D)B. Thus eigenvalues of B are FPdim(D)\nand zero, and B is diagonalizable. Since bij > 0, by the Frobenius-Perron theorem\nthe multiplicity of the eigenvalue FPdim(D) is 1, so the rank of B is 1. Hence\nTr(B) = FPdim(D).\nOn the other hand, let us compute bii . We have\nX\nFPdim(X)[F (X) : 1ii ] = bii /FPdim(C)\nX\u2208Irr(D)\n\n(as Eii = Rii /FPdim(C)). Thus, bii /FPdim(C) is an algebraic integer. Summing\nover all i, we find that Tr(B)/FPdim(C) = FPdim(D)/FPdim(C) is an algebraic\ninteger, as desired.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.16. Since bii \u2265 1, we see that FPdim(D)/FPdim(C) dominates the\nnumber of indecomposable blocks in D as a left C-module category.\n\n\u2217\nRemark\n8.17. Let M1 = C. Then Ci1\n= Mi . It is easy to see that F (R)i1 =\nP\n\u2217\nFPdim(X)X.\nBy\nuniqueness\nof\neigen-object of F (R) in \u2295j Cji\n, we have\nX\u2208Irr(Mi )\nF (R)i1 \u2297 F (R)1i = FPdim(C)F (R)ii . Thus,\n\n[F (R)ii : 1ii ] = dim End(F (R)i1 , F (R)i1 )/FPdim(C) = FPdim(Mi )/FPdim(C).\n\nThis implies the refinement of Theorem 8.15 stating that FPdim(Mi )/FPdim(C)\nis an algebraic integer.\nRemark 8.18. We do not know if the global dimension of a fusion category is\ndivisible by the global dimension of its full tensor subcategory.\nExample 8.19. The following example shows that Proposition 8.15 is a property\nof tensor categories and not just of based rings.\nLet G be a finite group and n a nonnegative integer. Consider the based ring\nAn (G) with basis G \u222a {X}, with multiplication given by the usual\nP multiplication\nin G and the relations gX = Xg = X, g \u2208 G, and X 2 = nX + g\u2208G g. Such rings\nfor special n, G can arise as Grothendieck rings of fusion categories (for example,\nthe categories of [TY], or representation categories of affine p\ngroups Aff(Fq )). We\nclaim that if An (G) is categorifiable, then the number (n + n2 + 4|G|)2 /4|G| is\nan algebraic integer. In particular, for n 6= 0 one has |G| \u2264 2n2 . (For n = 1 we\nfind |G| = 1, 2, so G = 1 or G = Z/2Z, which was proved by T. Chmutova even\nfor non-rigid categories). Indeed, let C be a fusion category with Grothendieck ring\nAn (G). Then the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of elements of G are 1, while the\nFrobenius-Perron dimension of X\u221ais the largest root of the equation x2 \u2212nx\u2212m = 0,\nwhere m = |G|. Thus x = 21 (n + n2 + 4m). By Proposition 8.15, x2 /m should be\nan algebraic integer.\nProposition 8.20. If a fusion category C is faithfully graded by a finite group G,\nthen the Frobenius-Perron dimensions of Cg are equal for all g \u2208 G. In particular,\n|G| divides FPdim(C).\n\n\f34\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nProof. Let R be the regular object of C. Then R = \u2295Rg , where Rg is a virtual\nobject of Cg . We have R \u2297 Rh = FPdim(Rh )R. Taking the gh-th component of this\nequation, we find Rg \u2297 Rh = FPdim(Rh )Rgh . Similarly, Rg \u2297 R = FPdim(Rg )R,\nwhich yields Rg \u2297 Rh = FPdim(Rg )Rgh . Since Rgh 6= 0, we get FPdim(Rg ) =\nFPdim(Rh ), i.e. FPdim(Rg ) = FPdim(X)/|G|.\n\u0003\n8.3. Comparison of the global and Frobenius-Perron dimensions.\nProposition 8.21. Let C be a fusion category. Then for any simple object V of C\none has |V |2 \u2264 FPdim(V )2 , and hence dim(C) \u2264 FPdim(C). Hence, if dim(C) =\nFPdim(C) then |V |2 = FPdim(V )2 for all simple objects V .\nProof. Let Xi be the i-th simple object of C, and di = d(Xi ) be its dimension\nintroduced in the proof of Theorem 2.3. Then |di |2 = |V |2 , and di is an eigenvalue\nof the matrix Ti . It follows from Section 3 that the absolute values of the entries of\nTi are dominated by the corresponding entries of the matrix Ni of multiplication\nby Xi . Let fi be the Frobenius-Perron dimension\nof XiP\n, and consider a norm on\nP\nthe Grothendieck group GrC (C) given by || ai Xi || =\nfi |ai |. Let us estimate\nthe norm of the operator Ti . We have\nX\nX\nX\nX\nfj |\n(Ti )jk ak | \u2264\nfj (Ni )jk |ak | = fi\nfk |ak | = fi ||a||\n||Ti a|| =\nj\n\nk\n\nj,k\n\nk\n\nThus, ||Ti || \u2264 fi . This implies that |V |2 \u2264 fi2 , which proves the proposition.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 8.22. Let C be a fusion category of global dimension D and FrobeniusPerron dimension \u2206. Then D/\u2206 is an algebraic integer, which is \u2264 1.\nProof. By Proposition 8.21, we only need to prove that D/\u2206 is an algebraic integer.\nFirst of all, we can assume without loss of generality that C is a spherical category.\nIndeed, if C is not spherical, then, as explained in Proposition 5.14, we can construct\na spherical fusion category C \u0303 which projects onto C. It is easy to see that this\ncategory has global dimension 2D and Frobenius-Perron dimension 2\u2206, so the ratio\nof dimensions is the same.\nNow assume that C is spherical. Consider the Drinfeld center Z(C). This is a\nmodular category of global dimension D2 , and by Proposition 8.12, its FrobeniusPerron dimension is \u22062 . Let S = (sij ) be its S-matrix. It follows from Verlinde's\nformula (see [BaKi]) that the commuting matrices Ni of multiplication by simple\nobjects Xi of Z(C) have common eigenvectors vj with eigenvalues sij /s0j . In particular, there exists a unique (by nondegeneracy of S) distinguished label j = r such\nthat sir /s0r = fi , the Frobenius-Perron dimension of XiP\n. Since S is symmetric,\nand S 2 is the charge conjugation matrix, we have \u22062 = i fi2 = \u03b4rr\u2217 /s20r . Thus\nr = r\u2217 and \u22062 = 1/s20r = D2 /d2r , where dr is the categorical dimension of the r-th\nsimple object. So D2 /\u22062 = d2r is an algebraic integer.\n\u0003\n8.4. Pseudo-unitary categories. Let us say that a fusion category C is pseudounitary if dim(C) = FPdim(C). This property is automatically satisfied for unitary\ncategories, which occur in the theory of operator algebras, but it fails, for example,\nfor the Yang-Lee category.\nProposition 8.23. Any pseudo-unitary fusion category C admits a unique pivotal\n(in fact, spherical) structure, with respect to which the categorical dimensions of all\nsimple objects are positive, and coincide with their Frobenius-Perron dimensions.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n35\n\nProof. Let g : Id \u2192 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2217 be an isomorphism of tensor functors, a : Id \u2192 \u2217\u2217 an\nisomorphism of additive functors, such that a2 = g, di be the dimensions of simple\nobjects Xi associated to a as in Section 3.1, and d the vector with components\ndi . Then Ti d = di d, and |di | = fi is the Frobenius-Perron dimension of Xi . But\n|(Ti )jk | \u2264 (Ni )jk . Thus,\nX\nX\nfi fj = |di dj | = |\n(Ti )jk dk | \u2264\n(Ni )jk fk = fi fj\nThis means that the inequality in this chain is an equality. In particular (Ti )jk =\n\u00b1(Ni )jk , and the argument of di dj equals the argument of (Ti )jk dk whenever\n(Ni )jk > 0. This implies that whenever Xk occurs in the tensor product Xi \u2297 Xj ,\nthe ratio d2i d2j /d2k is positive. Thus, the automorphism of the identity functor \u03c3\ndefined by \u03c3|Xi = d2i /|di |2 is a tensor automorphism. Let us twist g by this automorphism. After this twisting, the new dimensions di will be real. Thus, we can\nassume without loss of generality that di were real from the beginning.\nIt remains to twist the square root a of g by the automorphism of the identity\nfunctor \u03c4 given by \u03c4 |Xi = di /|di |. After this twisting, new Ti is Ni and new dk is\nfk . This means that \u03b2ijk = 1 and a is a pivotal structure with positive dimensions.\nIt is obvious that such a structure is unique. We are done.\n\u0003\n8.5. Fusion categories with integer Frobenius-Perron dimension.\nProposition 8.24. Let C be a fusion category, such that \u2206 := FPdim(C) is an\ninteger. Then C is pseudo-unitary. In particular, the category of representations of\na semisimple finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra is pseudo-unitary.\nProof. Let D be the global dimension of C. Let D1 = D, D2 , ..., DN be all the\nalgebraic conjugates of D, and g1 , ..., gN the elements of Gal(Q\u0304/Q) such that Di =\ngi (D). Applying PropostionQ8.22 to the category gi (C), we find that Di /\u2206 is an\nalgebraic integer \u2264 1. Then i (Di /\u2206) is an algebraic integer \u2264 1. But this product\nis a rational number. So it equals 1 and hence all factors equal 1. Hence D = \u2206,\nas desired.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.25. We note that Proposition 8.24 may be regarded as a categorical\nanalog of the well known theorem of Larson and Radford [LR2], saying that in a\nsemisimple Hopf algebra, the square of the antipode is the identity. More precisely,\nusing Proposition 8.24, one can obtain the following proof of the Larson-Radford\ntheorem (which is close to the original proof). Let A be a finite dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra with antipode S. Since S has finite order, S 2 is semisimple,\nand its eigenvalues are roots of 1. Now, for every simple A-module V , S 2 preserves End(V ) \u2282 A (as V \u2217\u2217 is isomorphic to V ), and |V |2 = Tr(S 2 |End(V ) ), while\nFPdim(V )2 = dim(V )2 = dim End(V ). Thus, by Proposition 8.24, Tr(S 2 |End(V ) ) =\ndim End(V ). Since S 2 is semisimple and its eigenvalues are roots of unity, we have\nS 2 = 1.\nRemark 8.26. In general, the Frobenius-Perron dimension of a fusion category\nmay not only be different from its global dimension, but may in fact be not conjugate\nto the global dimension by the Galois group action. The same is true for the\nnumbers FPdim(V )2 and |V |2 for a simple object V . An example is a tensor\nproduct of the Yang-Lee category and its Galois\nconjugate. It has global dimension\n\u221a\n5, but Frobenius-Perron dimension 5(3 + 5)/2.\u221aAlso, this category has a simple\nobject V with |V |2 = 1 but FPdim(V )2 = (7 + 3 5)/2.\n\n\f36\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nOne may wonder if a fusion category C with integer FPdim(C) must have integer\nFrobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects. Unfortunately, the answer is \"no\"\n(see [TY], where dimensions of some simple objects are square roots of integers).\nHowever, the following weaker result is true. Let Cad be the full tensor subcategory\nof C generated by objects occuring in X \u2297X \u2217 , where X \u2208 C is simple (if C = Rep(G)\nfor a group G then Cad is the representation category of the adjoint group G/Z(G)\n\u2013 the quotient by the center).\nProposition 8.27. Suppose that FPdim(C) is an integer. The Frobenius-Perron\ndimensions of simple objects in\u221aCad are integers. Furthermore, for any simple object\nX \u2208 C, one has FPdim(X) = N , where N is an integer.\nProof. The second statement follows from the first one, since for any simple object\nX \u2208 C the object X \u2297 X \u2217 lies in Cad . To prove the first statement, consider\nthe object B = \u2295i Xi \u2297 Xi\u2217 \u2208 Cad , where Xi are the simple objects of C. For\nsome n the matrix of multiplication by the object B \u2297n has strictly positive entries.\nOn the other hand, the vector of dimensions of objects of Cad is an eigenvector\nof this matrix with integer eigenvalue FPdim(C)n . Thus, by the Frobenius-Perron\ntheorem its entries are rational (as d0 = 1), and hence integer (as they are algebraic\nintegers).\n\u0003\n8.6. Fusion categories of Frobenius-Perron dimension pn .\nTheorem 8.28. Let C be a fusion category of Frobenius-Perron dimension pn ,\nwhere n \u2265 1 is an integer, and p is a prime. Then:\n(i) There exists a nontrivial automorphism g \u2208 Aut\u2297 (IdC ) of order p, so that\nC is Z/pZ graded: C = \u2295p\u22121\nj=0 Cj , where Cj is spanned by simple objects X such\nthat g|X = e2\u03c0ij/p . The Frobenius-Perron dimension of the fusion category C0 and\nmodule categories Cj over it are equal to pn\u22121 .\n(ii) C admits a filtration by fusion subcategories C \u2283 C (1) \u2283 ... \u2283 C (n) =< 1 >,\nwhere dim C (i) = pn\u2212i .\nRemark 8.29. For representation categories of semisimple Hopf algebras, this\ntheorem says that a semisimple Hopf algebra of order pn has a central grouplike element of order p, so one can take a quotient and obtain a Hopf algebra of\ndimension pn\u22121 . This result is due to Masuoka [Ma].\nProof. It is clear that (ii) follows from (i), so it suffices to prove (i). Since the\nFrobenius-Perron dimension of C is an integer, it is pseudo-unitary. In particular,\nit is spherical. By Proposition 3.3, the dimensions of all objects X \u2208 Z(C) which\noccur in I(1), are divisors of pn . In addition, they are all integers, since the image\nof X in C belongs to Cad . By the class equation (Proposition 5.7), there have to be\nat least p such objects X, which are invertible. This means, the group of invertible\nobjects of Z(C) is nontrivial. By Proposition 8.15, the order of this group must\ndivide p2n . In particular, this group contains a cyclic subgroup G of order p. The\ngroup G maps trivially to C, so by Proposition 5.10 we get a faithful G\u2228 -grading\non C. The rest follows from Proposition 8.20. The theorem is proved.\n\u0003\nThe following corollary of this result is a categorical generalization of (the semisimple case of) the well known result of Y. Zhu [Zhu] saying that a Hopf algebra of\nprime dimension is a group algebra.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n37\n\nCorollary 8.30. Let C be a fusion category of Frobenius-Perron dimension p, where\np is a prime number. Then C is the category of representations of the group Z/pZ,\nin which associativity is defined by a cohomology class in H 3 (Z/pZ, C\u2217 ) = Z/pZ.\nProof. The corollary is immediate from Theorem 8.28. Indeed, this theorem shows\nthat C is faithfully graded by Z/pZ, so by Proposition 8.20, all Cg are 1-dimensional,\ni.e. Cg contains a single simple object, which is invertible. Thus, C has p simple\nobjects, which are invertible, and we are done.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.31. A semisimple quasi-Hopf algebra of prime dimension p is twist\nequivalent to the group algebra of a cyclic group of order p, with associator defined\nby a 3-cocycle.\nThe following proposition classifies fusion categories of dimension p2 .\nProposition 8.32. Let C be a fusion category of Frobenius-Perron dimension p2 ,\nwhere p is a prime number. If p is odd, then simple objects of C are invertible, so\nC is the category of representations of a group of order p2 with associativity defined\nby a 3-cocycle. If p = 2, then either C is the representation category \u221a\nof a group of\norder 4 with a 3-cocycle, or it has 3 objects of dimensions 1, 1 and 2, and thus\nbelongs to the list of [TY].\nProof. Assume that not all simple objects of C are invertible. Our job is to show\nthat p = 2. Indeed, in this case the dimension is 4, and we have a subcategory of\ndimension 2 by Theorem 8.28. Since dimensions of all simple objects\n\u221a are square\nroots of integers, there is room for only one new object of dimension 2. All such\ncategories are listed in [TY] (there are two of them, and they correspond in physics\nto \"Ising model\").\nAssume the contrary, i.e. that p is odd. We have a grading of C by Z/pZ, and\nfor all j \u2208 Z/pZ the dimension of Cj is p by Proposition 8.20. Clearly, C0 holds\np invertible simple objects, and no other simple objects. It is also clear that all\ninvertible objects of C are contained in C0 (as by Proposition 8.15, the order of\nthe group of invertibles is a divisor of p2 ). Further, any object X in Cj , j 6= 0,\nmust be invariant under tensoring (on either side) with invertibles from C0 , since\notherwise the dimension of Cj would be greater than p (as the dimension of X is\ngreater than 1). This means that X \u2297 X \u2217 contains all the invertibles from C0 , and\n\u221a\nhence the dimension of X is at least p. Since the dimension of Cj is p, we find\n\u221a\nthat the dimension of X is exactly p, and X is the only simple object of Cj . Let\nj, k \u2208 Z/pZ be nonzero and distinct (they exist since p > 2). Let Xj , Xk be the\nonly simple objects of Cj , Ck . Then Xj \u2297 Xk\u2217 is a p-dimensional object, which is an\n\u221a\ninteger multiple of a p-dimensional object, which spans Cj\u2212k . Contradicton. The\nproposition is proved.\n\u0003\n8.7. Categories with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects.\nTheorem 8.33. Let C be a fusion category. The following two conditions are\nequivalent.\n(i) for all X \u2208 C, the number FPdim(X) is an integer.\n(ii) C is a representation category of a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra A.\nRemark 8.34. It is shown in [EG2] that A is determined uniquely up to twisting.\n\n\f38\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nProof. (i)\u2192 (ii). Let F : C \u2192 Vect be the additive functor that maps simple objects\nXi of C to vector spaces F (Xi ) of dimension FPdim(Xi ). For any i, j, choose any\nisomorphism Jij : F (Xi ) \u2297 F (Xj ) \u2192 F (Xi \u2297 Xj ) (this is possible by Theorem 8.6).\nThen by a standard reconstruction argument the algebra Endk (F ) has a natural\nstructure of a quasi-Hopf algebra (changing J corresponds to twisting the quasiHopf algebra). We note that A is not, in general, a Hopf algebra, since J is not\nrequired to be a tensor structure on F .\n(ii)\u2192 (i). This is clear since for C = Rep(A), FPdim(X) = Dim(X), where\nDim(X) denotes the dimension of the underlying vector space.\n\u0003\nIt is obvious that the class of fusion categories with integer Frobenius-Perron\ndimensions is closed under the operations of tensor product, passing to the opposite\ncategory, and taking a fusion subcategory. The following theorem shows that it is\nalso closed under taking duals (i.e., in the language of [Mu1],[O] the property of\ninteger Frobenius-Perron dimensions is weak Morita invariant).\nTheorem 8.35. Let C be a fusion category with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions, M be an indecomposable module category over C. Then the fusion category\n\u2217\nCM\nhas integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions.\n\u2217\nProof. We know from [Mu1],[O1] that Z(C) is canonically equivalent to Z(CM\n). So\nlet V be an object of Z(C) such that the matrix of multiplication by V in both\n\u2217\n\u2217\nC and CM\nhas strictly positive entries (it exists, since both C and CM\nare fusion\n\u2217\ncategories, and so the natural functors Z(C) \u2192 C, Z(C \u2217 ) \u2192 CM\nare surjective).\nLet [X], [X]\u2217 be the matrices of multiplication by X \u2208 Z(C) in the Grothendieck\n\u2217\ngroups K(C), K(CM\n), respectively. For a square matrix A with nonnegative entries,\nlet t(A) be the largest real eigenvalue of A. By the assumptions of the theorem,\nt([V ]) is an integer (it is the Frobenius-Perron dimension of V as an object of C).\nSince the asssignments X \u2192 t([X]), X \u2192 t([X]\u2217 ), X \u2208 Z(C), are both homomorphisms of algebras, Lemma 8.3 implies that t([V ]) = t([V ]\u2217 ). Hence, t([V ]\u2217 ) is an\ninteger.\n\u2217\nThe vector of Frobenius-Perron dimensions of simple objects in CM\nis the unique,\nup to scaling, eigenvector of [V ]\u2217 with eigenvalue t([V ]\u2217 ). Since the matrix [V ]\u2217 has\ninteger entries, the entries of this vector are rational numbers (as the zeroth entry\nis 1). This means that they are integers (as they are eigenvalues of integer matrices\nand hence algebraic integers). The theorem is proved.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 8.36. The class of fusion categories with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions is closed under the operation of taking a component of a quotient category.\nProof. Let C be a fusion category with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions, D an\nindecomposable multi-fusion category, and and F : C \u2192 D be a surjective tensor\nfunctor (so D is a quotient of C). Let M be an indecomposable module category\nover D. Then F \u2217 : D\u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 is an injective tensor functor between the corresponding\ndual fusion categories (C \u2217 is fusion since M is indecomposable over C, by surjectivity\nof F ). By Theorem 8.35, C \u2217 has integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions. Hence, so\ndoes D\u2217 as its full subcategory. But any component category Dii of D is dual to\nD\u2217 with respect to the i-th part of M as a D\u2217 -module. Thus, Dii has integer\nFrobenius-Perron dimensions by Theorem 8.35.\n\u0003\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n39\n\nProposition 8.37. Let C be a fusion category with integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions. Then for any indecomposable module category M over C, the FrobeniusPerron dimensions of objects in M are integers (under a suitable normalization).\nProof. Since the matrix [V ]M from Proposition 8.7 has integer entries, and its\nlargest real eigenvalue FPdim(V ) is an integer and has multiplicity 1, the entries\nof m are rational.\n\u0003\nIn [O2], it is asked whether there are finitely many fusion categories with a given\nnumber of simple objects, and proved that the answer is \"yes\" for representation\ncategories of Hopf algebras. Using the above techniques, one can show that the answer is \"yes\" for fusion categories with integer Frobenius-Perron dimension (which\nincludes Hopf and quasi-Hopf algebras). Namely, we have\nProposition 8.38. There are finitely many fusion categories of integer FrobeniusPerron dimension with a given number of simple objects. In particular, there are\nfinitely many equivalence classes of semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras with a given\nnumber of matrix blocks.\nProof. Let C be such a category with N simple objects. Since the Frobenius-Perron\ndimension of C is an integer, it is pseudo-unitary, in particular has a canonical\nspherical structure. Let di be the categorical (=Frobenius-Perron) dimensions of\nsimple objects of Z(C) which occur in I(1), and D be its global (=Frobenius-Perron)\ndimension. Then di are integers (by Proposition 8.27, since for Xi occuring in I(1),\nXi |C lies in Cad by Proposition\n5.4). Thus, D/di = mi are (usual) integers by\nP\nProposition 3.3, and i [Xi |C : 1] m1i = 1. The number of summands 1/mi here is\nP\n[Xi |C : 1], which is at most N by Proposition 5.6. By a classical argument of\nLandau (see [O2] and references therein), the number of such collections mi is finite\nfor any given N . On the other hand, m0 = D (as X0 is the neutral object). Thus, D\nis bounded by some function of N . But for a given D, there are only finitely many\nfusion rings, and hence, by Ocneanu rigidity, finitely many fusion categories.\n\u0003\n8.8. Group-theoretical fusion categories. An example of a fusion category\nwith integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions is the category C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8) associated\nto quadruples (G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8), where G is a finite group, H is a subgroup, \u03c9 \u2208\nZ 3 (G, C\u2217 ) is a 3-cocycle, \u03c8 \u2208 C 2 (H, C\u2217 ) a 2-cochain such that d\u03c8 = \u03c9|H (see\n[O1]). Namely, let VecG,\u03c9 be the category of finite dimensional G-graded vector spaces with associativity defined by \u03c9. Let VecG,\u03c9 (H) be the subcategory of\nVecG,\u03c9 of objects graded by H. Consider the twisted group algebra A = C\u03c8 [H].\nSince d\u03c8 = \u03c9|H , it is an associative algebra in this category. Then C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8) is\ndefined to be the category of A-bimodules in VecG,\u03c9 .\nRemark 8.39. If (\u03c9 \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) is another pair of elements such that \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 + d\u03b7, \u03c8 \u2032 =\n\u03c8 + \u03b7|H + d\u03c7, \u03b7 \u2208 C 2 (G, C\u2217 ), \u03c7 \u2208 C 1 (H, C\u2217 ), then C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8) is equivalent\nto C(G, H, \u03c9 \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ). Thus, the categories C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8) are parametrized by the set\nS(G, H) of equivalence classes of pairs (\u03c9, \u03c8) under the above equivalence, which\nis a fibration over Ker(H 3 (G, C\u2217 ) \u2192 H 3 (H, C\u2217 )) with fiber being a torsor over\nCoker(H 2 (G, C\u2217 ) \u2192 H 2 (H, C\u2217 )).\nDefinition 8.40. A fusion category is said to be group-theoretical if it is of the\nform C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8).\n\n\f40\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nRemark 8.41. We note that there may be more than one way to represent a given\nfusion category in the form C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8). In particular, G is not uniquely determined. However, |G| is uniquely determined, since it equals the global dimension\nof C(G, H, \u03c9, \u03c8).\nGroup-theoretical fusion categories have the following simple characterization.\nLet us say that a fusion category D is pointed if all its simple objects are invertible.\nAny pointed fusion category has the form VecG,\u03c9 .\nProposition 8.42. [O1]. A fusion category C is group-theoretical if and only if it\nis dual to a pointed category with respect to some indecomposable module category.\nCorollary 8.43. Group-theoretical fusion categories have integer Frobenius-Perron\ndimensions of simple objects. In particular, they are pseudo-unitary.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 8.42, Theorem 8.35, and the fact that any\ninvertible object has Frobenius-Perron dimension 1.\n\u0003\nIt is clear from the results of [O1] that the class of group-theoretical categories\nis closed under tensor product, taking the opposite category, and taking the dual\ncategory with respect to an indecomposable module category. Moreover, the following result shows that this class is also closed under taking a subcategory or a\ncomponent of a quotient category.\nProposition 8.44. (i) A full fusion subcategory of a group-theoretical category is\ngroup-theoretical.\n(ii) A component in a quotient category of a group-theoretical category is grouptheoretical.\nProof. (i) Let C \u2282 D be fusion categories (C is a full subcategory), and let D be\ngroup-theoretical. Let M be an indecomposable module category over D such that\nD\u2217 is VecG,\u03c9 . Then by Proposition 5.3, C \u2217 is a quotient of VecG,\u03c9 . Let I label the\ncomponent categories of C \u2217 . It is clear that for each g \u2208 G and i \u2208 I there exists\na unique g(i) \u2208 I such that the functor g\u2297 is an equivalence Cir \u2192 Cg(i)r for each\nr \u2208 I. So we have an action of G on I. Let j \u2208 I and H be the stabilizer of j in G.\n\u2217\nFor any g \u2208 H, denote by \u1e21jj the projection of g to the fusion category Cjj\n. Then\n\u2217\nthe assignment g \u2192 \u1e21jj is a surjective tensor functor VecH,\u03c9 \u2192 Cjj . This functor\n\u2217\nmust map invertible objects to invertible objects. Hence, all simple objects of Cjj\n\u2217\nare invertible, so Cjj is pointed, and hence C is group-theoretical (as it is dual to\n\u2217\nCjj\nwith respect to a module category).\n(ii) Let D be group-theoretical, F : D \u2192 C be surjective (C is indecomposable),\nand Cii a component of C. We need to show that Cii is group-theoretical. Let\nM be an indecomposable module category over C. It suffices to show that C \u2217 is\ngroup-theoretical, as C \u2217 is dual to Cii with respect to the i-th part of M. But by\nProposition 5.3, C \u2217 is embedded into D\u2217 , so it suffices to know that D\u2217 is grouptheoretical, which follows by duality from the fact that D is group-theoretical. \u0003\n8.9. A question. We think that the following question is interesting.\nQuestion 8.45. Does there exist a finite dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H\nwhose representation category is not group-theoretical?\nRemark 8.46. Hopf algebras with group theoretical category of representations\ncan be completely classified in group theoretical terms (see [O1]). Therefore, a\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n41\n\nnegative answer to Question 8.45 would provide a full classification of semisimple\nHopf algebras.\nRemark 8.47. The answer to Question 8.45 is \"no\" for triangular Hopf algebras,\nas follows from [EG3]. However, if the answer is \"yes\" in general, then it is \"yes\" already for quasitriangular Hopf algebras. Indeed, if Rep(D(H)) is group-theoretical\nthen so is Rep(H) \u2297 Rep(H \u2217cop ) (as a dual category to RepD(H)), from which it\nfollows by Proposition 8.44 that so is Rep(H).\nRemark 8.48. It is interesting that there exists a quasi-Hopf algebra H whose\ncategory of representations is not group-theoretical. Namely, recall that in [TY],\nthere is a classification of fusion categories whose simple objects are elements of a\ngroup G andP\nan additional object X = X \u2217 , with fusion rules g \u2297 X = X \u2297 g =\nX, X \u2297 X = g\u2208G g (and the usual multiplication rule in G). The result is that G\nmust be abelian, and for each G the categories are parametrized by pairs (q, r) where\nq is a nondegenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form on G with coefficients in C\u2217 , and r\np\nis a choice of |G|. Let us denote such category by T Y (G, q, r). It is clear that\nT Y (G, q, r) is a representation category of a quasi-Hopf algebra (i.e. has integer\nFrobenius-Perron dimensions) iff |G| is a square. So let us take G = (Z/p)2 , where\np > 2 is a prime, and let q be given by q((x, y), (x, y)) = ax2 \u2212 by 2 , where a, b \u2208 Fp\nand a/b is a quadratic non-residue (i.e. the quadratic form ax2 \u2212 by 2 is elliptic).\nThen one can check by direct inspection that T Y (G, q, r) is not group-theoretical.\n(We note that T Y (G, q, r) is not a representation category\np of a Hopf algebra; on\nthe other hand, if q is a hyperbolic form, then T Y (G, q, + |G|) is a representation\ncategory of a Hopf algebra, but is group-theoretical).\n8.10. Cyclotomicity of dimension functions. The forgetful functor Z(C) \u2192 C\ninduces a homomorphism of rings F : K(Z(C)) \u2192 K(C). It is clear that the image\nof this map is contained in the center Z(K(C)) of the ring K(C).\nLemma 8.49. The map K(Z(C)) \u2297 Q \u2192 Z(K(C)) \u2297 Q is surjective.\nProof. Recall that I : C \u2192 Z(C) denotes the induction functor, that is the left\nadjoint to the forgetful functor Z(C) \u2192 C. We will denote the induced map K(C) \u2192\nK(Z(C)) by thePsame letter. Let bi be the basis of K(C). We have by Proposition\n\u2217\n5.4 F (I(x)) =\nP i b\u2217i xbi for any x \u2208 K(C). In particular for x \u2208 Z(K(C)) we have\nF\n= x i bi bi . Finally note that the operator of multiplication by the element\nP(I(x))\n\u2217\ni bi bi \u2208 Z(K(C)) is a self-adjoint positive definite operator K(C) \u2192 K(C) (with\nrespect to the usual scalar product defined by (bi , b\u2217j ) = \u03b4ij ) and hence invertible.\nThe Lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.50. In the special case C = Rep(H) for some Hopf algebra H Lemma\n8.49 was proved in [KSZ] 6.3.\nTheorem 8.51. Let C be a fusion category over C and let L be an irreducible\nrepresentation of K(C). There exists a root of unity \u03be such that for any object X\nof C one has Tr([X], L) \u2208 Z[\u03be].\nProof. First of all we can assume without loss of generality that the category C\nis spherical. Indeed as explained in Proposition 5.14 we can construct a spheri \u0303 \u2192 K(C) is\ncal fusion category C \u0303 which projects onto C; moreover the map K(C)\n \u0303\nsurjective and the simple objects of C map to the simple objects of C.\n\n\f42\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nP Now let C\u2217 be spherical and let bi be the basis of K(C). The element eL =\ni Tr(bi , L)bi is proportional to a primitive central idempotent in K(C), see e.g.\n[L] 19.2 (b). By Lemma 8.49 there exists a primitive central idempotent \u1ebdL \u2208\nK(Z(C)) such that eL is proportional to F (\u1ebdL ). The element \u1ebdL can expressed in\nterms of S\u2212matrix of the category Z(C), see e.g. [BaKi]. By Theorem 10.1 there\nexists a root of unity \u03be such that the entries of S\u2212matrix lie in Q(\u03be) and thus\n\u1ebdL \u2208 K(Z(C)) \u2297 Q(\u03be). Hence eL is proportional to some element of K(C) \u2297 Q(\u03be).\nNow the coefficient of b0 = 1 \u2208 K(C) in eL equals to dim(L) \u2208 Q(\u03be) and is nonzero.\nHence eL \u2208 K(C) \u2297 Q(\u03be) and Tr(bi , L) \u2208 Q(\u03be). Obviously the number Tr(bi , L)\nis an algebraic integer and the ring of integers in Q(\u03be) is Z[\u03be]. The Theorem is\nproved.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.52. Again in the case when C = Rep(H) for some Hopf algebra H\nTheorem 8.51 is proved in [KSZ] 6.3.\nCorollary 8.53. Any irreducible representation of K(C) is defined over some\ncyclotomic field. In particular for any homomorphism \u03c6 : K(C) \u2192 C we have\n\u03c6(bi ) \u2208 Q[\u03be] for some root of unity \u03be.\nProof. Let Qab be the field of all cyclotomic numbers. We already proved that\nK(C) \u2297 Qab decomposes into direct sum of simple algebras (such decomposition\nis the same as the decomposition of 1 \u2208 K(C) into the sum of primitive central\nidempotents). Now it is well known that the Brauer group of Qab is trivial. The\nresult follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.54. Let C be a fusion category over C. There exists a root of unity \u03be\nsuch that for any object X of C one has FPdim(X) \u2208 Z[\u03be].\n8.11. Module categories over products. Let a, b be two algebraic integers. We\nsay that a, b are coprime if there exist algebraic integers p, q such that pa + qb = 1.\nProposition 8.55. Let C, D be nondegenerate fusion categories with coprime FrobeniusPerron dimensions. Then any indecomposable module category over C\u2297D is M\u2297N ,\nwhere M is an indecomposable module category over C, and N over D.\nProof. Let B be an indecomposable module category over C \u2297 D. Let us restrict it\nto C. We get B|C = \u2295i Mi , where Mi are indecomposable. Thus the action of D on\nB can be regarded as a tensor functor F : D \u2192 \u2295i,j FunC (Mi , Mj ). Let D\u2032 be the\nimage of this functor, i.e. the category generated by subquotients of F (X). Then\nD\u2032 is a multifusion category, which is indecomposable (as B is indecomposable over\nC \u2297 D). Since the functor F : D \u2192 D\u2032 is surjective, the Frobenius-Perron dimension\nd of any component category of D\u2032 divides FPdim(D). On the other hand, each\ncomponent category of D\u2032 is a tensor subcategory in F unC (Mi , Mi ) for some i.\nThe latter is a dual category to C, so it has the same Frobenius-Perron dimension\nas C. Hence, d must divide FPdim(C). Thus, d = 1 by the coprimeness condition.\nHence D\u2032 = A \u2212 bimod, where A is a semisimple algebra, and furthermore, all Mi\nare equivalent to a single module category M. The functor F : D \u2192 D\u2032 defines a\nmodule category N over D, and it is clear that B = M \u2297 N . We are done.\n\u0003\nExample. Let Ch be the fusion category associated to the quantum group\nUq (so3 ) for q = e\u03c0i/h . The Frobenius-Perron dimension of this category is d(h) =\nh\n4 sin2 (\u03c0/h) (this follows from [BaKi], (3.3.9)). The denominator of this fraction is\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n43\n\nan algebraic integer. Thus, our result implies that if hi are pairwise coprime then\nany indecomposable module category over \u2297i Chi is the product of those over Chi .\n9. Fusion categories in positive characteristic\nIn this section we will consider fusion and multi-fusion categories over an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic p. We will show that many of\nthe results of the previous sections continue to hold in this case after very minor\nmodifications.\n9.1. List of modifications. Fusion and multi-fusion categories in characteristic p\nare defined in the same way as in charactersitic zero. Below we will describe the\nmodifications which need to be made to validate the statements from the previous\nsections in this case.\nSection 2. The statements of subsections 2.1, 2.2 which make sense generalize\nwithout changes, except the last statement of Theorem 2.3, which claims that the\nglobal dimension of a fusion category is nonzero. This is in fact false in positive\ncharacteristic. For example, if G is a finite group whose order is divisible by p, then\nthe category of modules over the function algebra Fun(G, k) is a fusion category\nof global dimension |G| = 0. This is the main difference between the zero and\npositive characteristic case. To deal with this difference, we introduce the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition 9.1. A fusion category over k is said to be nondegenerate if its global\ndimension is nonzero. An indecomposable multi-fusion category is nondegenerate if\nat least one of its component categories is nondegenerate. A multi-fusion category\nis nondegenerate if all its indecomposable parts are nondegenerate. A regular semisimple weak Hopf algebra over k is nondegenerate if its category of representations\nis a nondegenrate multi-fusion category.\nTheorems 2.15, 2.16, 2.18 remain valid if the category C is nondegenerate. Proposition 2.17 remains true without any additional conditions.\nIn Section 2.5 (and at other places throughout), the algebra R has to be chosen in\nsuch a way that its block sizes are not divisible by p (since only such algebras admit\na symmetric separability idempotent). Theorem 2.20 is valid for such R. Corollary\n2.22 and Theorem 2.24 also remain valid. Theorem 2.26 is valid for nondegenerate\nweak Hopf algebras.\nTheorems 2.27, 2.28, 2.30, 2.31, and Corollary 2.35 remain valid for nondegenerate categories. More precisely, in Theorems 2.27, 2.31 one only needs nondegeneracy\nof the category C.\nRemark 9.2. We note that the nondegeneracy condition is essential. For example,\nif A is the Hopf algebra Fun(G, k), where the order of G is divisible by p, then Theorem 2.15 is false for Rep(A), and Theorem 2.26 is false for A. Similarly, Theorem\n2.27 is false for Rep(A) and the identity functor, since the corresponding cohomology is H i (G, k), which may be nonzero if the order of G is divisible by p. However,\nwe do not know a counterexample to Theorem 2.28 in positive characteristic.\nSections 3-7. While Section 3 makes no sense in positive characteristic, the\nmaterial of Section 4 generalizes without changes, as long as one considers regular\nweak Hopf algebras. The only change in Section 5 is that one should always choose\n\n\f44\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nnonzero block sizes for the algebra R (except subsections 5.8,5.9 where the characteristic should be zero). Theorems 6.3 and 7.5 are valid for nondegenerate weak\nHopf algebras.\nSection 8. The results of Section 8.1 generalize without changes, since they\nhave nothing to do with the characteristic of the ground field. So do the results of\nSection 8.2, except Proposition 8.12, Corollary 8.14, and Proposition 8.15, which\nare valid for nondegenerate categories. Finally, let us point out that Theorem 8.33\nis valid in positive characteristic.\nExample. A semisimple Hopf algebra H is nondegenerate if and only if it is\ncosemisimple. Indeed, if H is nondegenerate, then so is Rep(H), and hence H \u2217\nis semisimple, since Rep(H \u2217op ) is a dual category to Rep(H). Conversely, if H\nis cosemisimple, then Tr(S 2 ) 6= 0 ([LR1]), so the global dimension of Rep(H) is\nnonzero, and H is nondegenerate.\n9.2. Lifting theorems. In this subsection we will show that a nondegenerate\nmulti-fusion category over a field of characteristic p, and a tensor functor between\nsuch categories, can be lifted to characteristic zero. It is an analog of the result\nof [EG1], where this was shown for semisimple cosemisimple Hopf algebras and\nmorphisms between them.\nFirst of all, we need to define fusion categories over any commutative ring. To\ndo this, recall that a fusion category over a field k can be regarded as a collection\nk\nof finite dimensional vector spaces Hij\n= Hom(Xi \u2297 Xj , Xk ) (multiplicity spaces),\ntogether with a collection of linear maps between tensor products of these spaces (associativity morphism, evaluation, coevaluation morphisms), satisfying some equations (axioms of a rigid tensor category). Now let R be a commutative ring with\nunit, and define a fusion category over R to be a collection of free finite rank Rk\nmodules Hij\ntogether with a collection of module homomorphisms satisfying the\nsame equations.\nTensor functors between fusion categories over k can be defined in similar terms,\nas collections of linear maps satisifying algebraic equations; this allows one to define\ntensor functors over R in an obvious way.\nNow let W (k) be the ring of Witt vectors of k. Let I be the maximal ideal in\nW (k) generated by p. If C is a fusion category over k, then a lifting of C to W (k) is\n \u0303 \u2192 C, where C/I\na fusion category C \u0303 over W (k), together with an equivalence C/I\nis the reduction of C modulo p. In a similar way one defines a lifting of a module\ncategory and, more generally, a lifting of a tensor functor.\nTheorem 9.3. A nondegenerate multi-fusion category C over k admits a unique\nlifting to W (k). Moreover, a tensor functor F between nondegenerate fusion categories C, C \u2032 over k admits a unique lifting to W (k). In particular, a module category\nover a nondegenerate multi-fusion category C has a unique lifting to W (k).\nProof. The theorem follows from the facts that H 3 (C) = 0, H 4 (C) = 0, HF2 (C) = 0,\nHF3 (C) = 0, proved in Section 7, in the same way as in [EG1].\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 9.4. A nondegenerate braided (symmetric) fusion category over k is\nuniquely liftable to a braided (resp. symmetric) fusion category over W (k).\nProof. A braiding on C is the same as a splitting C \u2192 Z(C) of the tensor functor\nZ(C) \u2192 C. By Theorem 9.3, such splitting is uniquely liftable. Hence, a braiding\non C is uniquely liftable.\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n45\n\nNow let us prove the result in the symmetric case. A braiding gives rise to a\ncategorical equivalence B : C \u2192 C op . A braiding is symmetric iff the composition\nof two categorical equivalences B and B 21 is the identity. Thus, Corollary follows\nfrom Theorem 9.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.5. Corollary 9.4 is false for degenerate categories. For example, let C \u0303\nbe the fusion category corresponding to the quantum group Uq (sl2 ) at q = e\u03c0i/p ,\nwhere p is an odd prime. This category is known to have semisimple reduction\nto F\u0304p , which is symmetric. However, this reduction does not lift to a symmetic\ncategory, since it has non-integer Frobenius-Perron dimensions. This example also\nshows that there exist semisimple and cosemisimple triangular weak Hopf algebras\nover k which do not come from group algebras. For usual Hopf algebras, this is\nimpossible (see [EG3]).\n9.3. Faithfulness of lifting. In this section we will show that the lifting procedure\nof nondegenerate fusion (braided, symmetric) categories is faithful, i.e. if two such\ncategories over k have equivalent liftings, then they are equivalent. We will also\nshow that if two tensor functors from a nondegenerate fusion category over k to\nanother fusion category have isomorphic liftings, then they are isomorphic.\nLet R be a complete local ring, F the fraction field of R, I \u2282 R the maximal\nideal, and k = R/I the residue field.\nTheorem 9.6. (i) Let C1 , C2 be fusion categories defined over R, such that the\nfusion categories C1 /I, C2 /I are nondegenerate, and the categories C1 \u2297R F, C2 \u2297R F\nare tensor equivalent. Then C1 , C2 (and hence C1 /I, C2 /I) are tensor equivalent.\n(ii) The same statement is valid for braided and symmetric fusion categories.\nProof. (i) Pick a tensor equivalence E : C1 \u2297R F \u2192 C2 \u2297R F. Now pick an equivalence\nof C1 , C2 as additive categories, which is the same as E at the level of isomorphism\nclasses of objects. By doing this, we may assume without loss of generality that\nC1 and C2 are really one category (C, \u2297) over R with two different associativity\nisomorphisms \u03a61 , \u03a62 and evaluation maps ev1 , ev2 (the coevaluation maps of simple\nobjects of both categories may be identified with any fixed collection of such maps\nby renormalization).\nWe know that there exists an invertible element J of C 2 (C) \u2297R F such that\n(\u03a61 , ev1 )J = (\u03a62 , ev2 ). (where J denotes the twisting by J). Our job is to show\nthat such J can be found in C 2 (C), without localization to F.\nConsider the affine group scheme T (defined over R) of all invertible elements of\nC 2 (C). Let T0 be the subscheme of T consisting of \"trivial\" twists, i.e. those of the\nform \u2206(x)(x\u22121 \u2297 x\u22121 ), where x is an invertible element of C 1 (C) (i.e. the center of\nC). It is clear that T0 is central in T .\nRemark. Since the algebra C 2 (C) is a direct sum of matrix algebras (split over\nR), T is a direct product of general linear groups.\nLet Z be the affine scheme of all invertible associators \u03a6 and collections of evaluation morphisms ev satisfying (together with the fixed coevaluation morphisms)\nthe axioms for a rigid tensor category (i.e. the pentagon relation, the unit object\naxiom, and the duality axioms). The group scheme T acts on Z by twisting (and\nthen renormalizing the coevaluations to be the fixed ones): (\u03a6, ev) \u2192 (\u03a6, ev)J . The\nrestriction of this action to T0 is trivial, so we get an action of T /T0 on Z. Consider\nthe regular mapping \u03c6 : T /T0 \u2192 Z, given by J \u2192 (\u03a61 , ev1 )J .\n\n\f46\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\nLemma 9.7. The mapping \u03c6 is finite.\nProof. By Nakayama's lemma, it is sufficient to check the finiteness of the reduction\n\u03c6|k of \u03c6 modulo I.\nFirst of all, we have H 2 (C1 /I) = 0, which implies that the stabilizer of (\u03a61 , ev1 )\nin T /T0 is a finite group. Thus the map \u03c6|k : T /T0 \u2192 \u03c6|k (T /T0 ) is a finite covering.\nIt remains to show that \u03c6|k (T /T0 ) is closed in Z. To do this, consider its closure\nZ \u2032 . Points of Z \u2032 represent fusion categories over k, all of which are nondegenerate\nIndeed, the global dimension is a regular (in fact, locally constant) function on Z,\nand it is nonzero on C1 /I, so it must be nonzero for all points of Z \u2032 . But for a\nnondegenerate fusion category D over k we have H 3 (D) = 0, which implies that\nthe action of T /T0 on Z \u2032 is locally transitive. This means that Z \u2032 is in fact a single\norbit of T /T0 , i.e. \u03c6|k (T /T0 ) is closed. The lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nThus we have a homomorphism \u03c6\u2217 : R[Z] \u2192 R[T /T0 ], which makes R[T /T0 ] into\na finitely generated R[Z]-module.\nNow let J \u2208 (T /T0 )(F) be such that (\u03a61 , ev1 )J = (\u03a62 , ev2 ). Thus, J can be\nregarded as a homomorphism J : R[T /T0 ] \u2192 F. This homomorphism satisfies\nthe condition J(af ) = \u03b3(a)J(f ), f \u2208 R[T /T0], a \u2208 R[Z]. where \u03b3 : R[Z] \u2192 R\ncorresponds to the point (\u03a62 , ev2 ). Now, by Lemma 9.7, for any f \u2208 R[T /T0 ] there\nexist b1 , ..., bn \u2208 R[Z] such that f n + b1 f n\u22121 + ... + bn = 0. But then J(f )n +\n\u03b3(b1 )J(f )n\u22121 + ... + \u03b3(bn ) = 0. Now, since \u03b3(bi ) are integers, we see that J(f )\nis an integer, so J in fact belongs to (T /T0 )(R). But it is easy to see that the\nmap T (R) \u2192 (T /T0 )(R) is surjective. Hence, there exists J \u2208 T (R) such that\n(\u03a61 , ev1 )J = (\u03a62 , ev2 ), as desired. The theorem is proved.\n(ii) The proof is the same, since, as we showed, the integrality of J \u2208 T /T0\nfollows already from the equation (\u03a61 , ev1 )J = (\u03a62 , ev2 ).\n\u0003\nTheorem 9.8. Let C, C \u2032 be fusion categories defined over R, such that the fusion\ncategory C/I is nondegenerate. Let F1 , F2 : C \u2192 C \u2032 be tensor functors, which become\nisomorphic after tensoring with F. Then F1 , F2 (and hence their reductions modulo\nI) are isomorphic.\nProof. The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 9.6. As in Theorem 9.6,\nwe may assume that F1 = F2 = F as additive functors, with two different tensor\nstructures J1 , J2 . Let G be the group scheme of invertible elements of CF1 (C). Let\nS be the scheme of tensor structures on F . The group scheme G naturally acts on\nS by \"gauge transformations\", J \u2192 J g . We know there exists g \u2208 G(F) such that\nJ1g = J2 , and need to show that this g is in fact in G(R).\nUsing the fact that HF1 (C) = HF2 (C) = 0, one finds that the action map \u03c7 : G \u2192 S\ngiven by g \u2192 J1g is finite. Now the proof that g \u2208 G(R) runs analogously to the\nproof that J \u2208 (T /T0 )(R) in Theorem 9.6. Theorem 9.8 is proved.\n\u0003\nNow let K be the algebraic closure of the field of quotients of W (k).\nCorollary 9.9. (i) If two nondegenerate fusion (braided, symmetric) categories\nover k have equivalent liftings to K, then they are equivalent.\n(ii) If two tensor functors between nondegenerate fusion categories over k have\nisomorphic liftings to K, then they are isomorphic.\nProof. (i) follows easily from Theorem 9.6, (ii) from Theorem 9.8.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fON FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n47\n\nTo give the next corollary, recall that in [EG1] it was proved that a semisimple\ncosemisimple Hopf algebra over k has a unique lifting to K. In fact, this is a special\ncase of the lifting theory developed in this paper, since a semisimple cosemisimple\nHopf algebra is nothing but a pair (C, F ), where C is a nondegenerate fusion category\nover k, and F a fiber functor on C.\nCorollary 9.10. If two semisimple cosemisimple Hopf algebras over k have isomorphic liftings to K then they are isomorphic.\nProof. We can regard these two Hopf algebras as pairs (C1 , F1 ) and (C2 , F2 ). By theorem 9.9(i), we can assume that C1 = C2 ; then by theorem 9.9(ii), F1 is isomorphic\nto F2 . The Corollary is proved.\n\u0003\nThe same theorem applies to quasitriangular, triangular Hopf algebras. The\nproof is parallel.\nWarning. (Added in April 2017.) Unfortunately, the proof of Lemma 9.7 (and\nhence of the main results on faithfulness of the lifting given in this subsection) is\nincomplete; namely, the Nakayama lemma is not sufficient here, and one needs to\nuse the fact that T is a reductive group, see [Et]. A complete proof of Lemma\n9.7, as well as alternative proofs of the results of this subsection are given in [Et],\nSection 4. This paper also gives an affirmative answer to the question in Remark\n9.14 below.\n9.4. Some applications of lifting.\nCorollary 9.11. Let C be a nondegenerate fusion category over k.\nFrobenius-Perron dimension \u2206 is not divisible by p.\n\nThen its\n\nRemark 9.12. We do not know if the converse statement is true. For Hopf algebras\nthe converse statement is the well known conjecture that if H is a semisimple Hopf\nalgebra whose dimension is not divisible by p then H is cosemisimple.\nProof. Assume that \u2206 is divisible by p. Let C \u0303 be the lifting of C, and C\u02c6 = C \u0303\u2297W (k) K,\nwhere K is the algebraic closure of the field of fractions of W (k). Then by Theorem\n8.22, the global dimension D of C\u02c6 is divisible by \u2206, hence by p. So the global\ndimension of C is zero. Contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 9.13. Let D be a nondegenerate fusion category over k, and C be a full\nsubcategory of D of integer Frobenius-Perron dimension N . Then C is nondegenerate.\nRemark 9.14. We do not know if this result is valid without assuming that N is\nan integer.\nProof. Consider the lifting D\u0303 of D. This lifting necessarily contains a lifting C \u0303 of\n\u02c6 D\u0302 over the algebraically closed field K\nC. Consider the corresponding categories C,\nof zero characteristic. Let D be the global dimension of D\u0302, \u2206 its Frobenius-Perron\ndimension. Then D is divisible by \u2206 by Proposition 8.22. Also, the FrobeniusPerron dimension of C\u02c6 is N (an integer), hence it is equal to the global dimension\nof C\u02c6 by Proposition 8.24. But by Theorem 8.15, N divides \u2206, and hence D. But\nD is not divisible by p, hence N is not divisible by p. Thus, C is nondegenerate, as\ndesired.\n\u0003\n\n\f48\n\nPAVEL ETINGOF, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VIKTOR OSTRIK\n\n10. Appendix: Galois properties of S-matrix\nThe remarkable result due to J. de Boere, J. Goeree, A. Coste and T. Gannon\nstates that the entries of the S-matrix of a semisimple modular category lie in a\ncyclotomic field, see [dBG, CG]. This result is used in Section 8. For reader's\nconvenience in this Appendix we reproduce a proof of this result.\nTheorem 10.1. Let S = (sij )i,j\u2208I be the S-matrix of a modular fusion category C.\nThere exists a root of unity \u03be such that sij \u2208 Q(\u03be).\nProof. Let {Xi }i\u2208I be the representatives of isomorphism classes of simple objects\nof C; let 0 \u2208 I be such that X0 is the unit object of C and the involution i 7\u2192 i\u2217 of\nI be defined by Xi\u2217 \u223c\n= Xi\u2217 .\nBy the definition of modularity, any homomorphism f : K(C) \u2192 C is of the form\nf ([Xi ]) = sij /s0j for some well defined j \u2208 I. Hence for any automorphism g of C\none has g(sij /s0j ) = sig(j) /s0g(j) for a well defined action of g on I.\nNow\nPwe are going to use the following identities (see [BaKi]):\n(i) j sij sjk = \u03b4ik\u2217 ;\n(ii) sij = sji ;\n\u2217 = s0i 6= 0.\n(iii) s0iP\nP\nThus, j sij sji\u2217 = 1 and hence (1/s0i )2 = j (sji /s0i )(sji\u2217 /s0i\u2217 ). Applying the\nautomorphism g to this equation we get\nX sji sji\u2217\nX sjg(i) sjg(i\u2217 )\n\u03b4g(i)g(i\u2217 )\u2217\n1\n)=\n=\n.\n(36)\ng( 2 ) = g(\ns0i\ns0i s0i\u2217\ns0g(i) s0g(i\u2217 )\ns0g(i) s0g(i\u2217 )\nj\nj\nIt follows that g(i\u2217 ) = g(i)\u2217 and g((s0i )2 ) = (s0g(i) )2 . Hence\ng((sij )2 ) = g((sij /s0j )2 * (s0j )2 ) = (sig(j) )2 .\n\nThus g(sij ) = \u00b1sig(j) . Moreover the sign \u01ebg (i) = \u00b11 such that g(s0i ) = \u01ebg (i)s0g(i)\nis well defined since s0i 6= 0, and g(sij ) = g((sij /s0j )s0j ) = \u01ebg (j)sig(j) = \u01ebg (i)sg(i)j .\nIn particular, the extension L of Q generated by all entries sij is finite and normal,\nthat is Galois extension.\nNow let h be another automorphism of C. We have\ngh(sij ) = g(\u01ebh (j)sih(j) ) = \u01ebg (i)\u01ebh (j)sg(i)h(j)\nand\nhg(sij ) = h(\u01ebg (i)sg(i)j ) = \u01ebh (j)\u01ebg (i)sg(i)h(j) = gh(sij )\nand the Galois group of L over Q is abelian. Now the Kronecker-Weber theorem\n(see e.g. [Ca]) implies the result.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[BaKi] B. Bakalov, A.
