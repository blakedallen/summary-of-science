Bobenko, Y. Suris)\nTo the first two orders, discrete holomorphic functions are whether complex\nlinear or M\u00f6bius transformations. We discretize this notion to complex functions of\nvertices \u26660 of an oriented quad-mesh \u2666. First, fix a direct embedding of this quadmesh into the complex plane by a complex function of the vertices Z : \u26660 \u2192 C,\ncorresponding to the identity map. We will say that another function is linear\nholomorphic (with respect to Z) if and only if the ratio along the diagonals are\nthe same as Z on each quadrilateral:\n\u2200(x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 \u26662 ,\n\nf (y \u2032 ) \u2212 f (y)\nZ(y \u2032 ) \u2212 Z(y)\n=\n= i \u03c1(x,x\u2032) .\nf (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)\nZ(x\u2032 ) \u2212 Z(x)\n\nLikewise we will say that a function is cross-ratio preserving if the cross-ratio on\neach quadrilateral is the same as the one given by Z:\nZ(x) \u2212 Z(y) Z(x\u2032 ) \u2212 Z(y \u2032 )\nf (x) \u2212 f (y) f (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (y \u2032 )\n=\n= q(x,y,x\u2032 ,y\u2032 ) .\nf (y) \u2212 f (x\u2032 ) f (y \u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)\nZ(y) \u2212 Z(x\u2032 ) Z(y \u2032 ) \u2212 Z(x)\nAn important class of cross-ratio preserving maps are given by circle patterns\nwith prescribed intersection angles. In the form of a Hirota system, a connection\nbetween the two notions can be described: A discrete function F is cross-ratio\npreserving if its exterior differential can \u0001be written,\non each edge (x, y) \u2208 \u26661\nR\nas F (y) \u2212 F (x) = f (x)f (y) Z(y) \u2212 Z(x) =: (x,y) f dZ for a function f . The\nH\nconstraint on f is the Morera equation: f dZ = 0 around every quadrilateral.\nLooking at logarithmic derivatives f\u01eb = f \u00d7 (1 + \u01ebg) of f that still form a Hirota system, one finds that g should be linear holomorphic with respect to F :\nF (y \u2032 )\u2212F (y)\ng(y \u2032 )\u2212g(y)\ng(x\u2032 )\u2212g(x) = FH(x\u2032 )\u2212F (x) . Linear constraints can as well be reformulated as a Morera equation f dZ = 0 not for a multiplicative but for an additive coupling\nR\n\u0001\n(y)\nbetween functions and 1-forms: (x,y) f dZ := f (x)+f\nZ(y) \u2212 Z(x) .\n2\nWe will be interested in so called critical reference maps Z composed of rhombi,\nthe length \u03b4 = |Z(y) \u2212 Z(x)| is constant for all edges (x, y) \u2208 \u26661 . Then these two\nconstraints are integrable, meaning that they give rise to a well-defined B\u00e4cklund\n(or Darboux) transform: given a linear holomorphic resp. cross-ratio preserving\nmap f and a starting point O \u2208 \u26660 , one can define a 2-parameters family f\u03bb,\u03bc of\ndeformations of f that still fulfill the same (linear resp. cross-ratio) condition and\nstarting value \u03bc at the point O. This is done by viewing the solution f lying on\na ground level and building \"vertically\", above each edge (x, y), a quadrilateral\nf\u03bb,\u03bc (x)\u2212f (y)\n\u03bb+Z(x)\u2212Z(y)\non which the same kind of equation will be imposed: f\u03bb,\u03bc\n(y)\u2212f (x) = \u03bb+Z(y)\u2212Z(x)\nfor the linear constraint, resp.\n\nf\u03bb,\u03bc (x)\u2212f (x) f (y)\u2212f\u03bb,\u03bc (y)\nf (x)\u2212f (y) f\u03bb,\u03bc (y)\u2212f\u03bb,\u03bc (x)\n\n=\n\n\u03bb2\nZ(y)\u2212Z(x)\n\n\u00012 for the\n\ncross-ratio constraint.\nIn [5], based on the point of view of integrable systems, we define discrete\nholomorphicity in Zd , for d > 1 finite, equipped with rapidities (\u03b1i )1\u2264i\u2264d and\n1\n\n\fthe tools of integrable theory yields interesting results like a Lax pair governing\na moving frame \u03a8(*, \u03bb) : Zd \u2192 GL2 (C)[\u03bb] and isomonodromic solutions like the\nGreen function found by Kenyon [4].\nAn important tool of the linear theory is the existence of an explicit basis of\ndiscrete holomorphic functions. In the rhombic case, for a discrete holomorphic\nfunction f , the 1-form f dZ is holomorphic (it is closed and its ratios on two dual\ndiagonals are equal to the reference ratios) and can be integrated, yielding back\na holomorphic function. Differential equations can be setup, producing explicit\nformulae for exponentials and polynomials which are shown to form a basis of\ndiscrete holomorphic functions.\nLots of results of the continuous theory can be extended\nto this discrete Rsettting:\nR\nThere exists a Hodge star : \u2217 : C k \u2192 C 2\u2212k , defined by (y,y\u2032 ) \u2217 \u03b1 := \u03c1(x,x\u2032 ) (x,x\u2032 ) \u03b1;\n\u2217\nthe discrete Laplacian is written as usual \u2206 := d d\u2217 + d\u2217 d with\nP d := \u2212 \u2217 d \u2217, which\nreads as weighted differences around neighbours \u2206 f (x) = \u03c1(x,xk ) (f (x)\u2212f (xk )).\nThe weights are given by the usual cotan formula.\n2\nRR A wedge product defines an L norm for functions and forms by (\u03b1, \u03b2) :=\n\u26662 \u03b1 \u2227 \u2217 \u03b2\u0304. The norm of df is called the Dirichlet energy of the function f ,\nP\nED (f ) := kdf k2 = (df, df ) = 12 (x,x\u2032 )\u2208\u039b1 \u03c1(x, x\u2032 ) |f (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)|2 . The conformal\nenergy of a map measures its conformality defect EC (f ) := 21 kdf \u2212 i \u2217 df k2 . They\nare related through EC (f ) = ED (f ) \u2212 2A(f ) just as in the continuous.\nThe Hodge star decomposes forms into exact, coexact and harmonic ones, the\nharmonic being the orthogonal sum of holomorphic and anti-holormorphic ones.\nA Weyl's lemma and a Green's identity are found.\nNon closed 1-forms with prescribed diagonal ratios define meromorphic forms\nand the holonomy around a quadrilateral is called its residue. The compact case\nis covered with flat atlases of critical maps for a given euclidean metric with conic\nsingularities. Meromorphic forms of prescribed holonomies and poles are defined\nand are used to form a basis of the space of holomorphic forms. It is 2g-dimensional\non a genus g surface, that is twice as large as the continuous case, defining two\nperiod matrices instead of one. This difference is explained by the doubling of\ndegrees of freedom, and partially solved through continuous limit theorems: the\ntwo period matrices converge to the same limit when refinements of quad-meshes\nfor a given Euclidean metric with conic singularities are taken. Every holomorphic\nfunction can be approximated by a converging sequence of discrete holomorphic\nfunctions on refinements of critical quad-meshes.\nThe Green function and potential allow one to setup a Cauchy integral formula\ngiving the value at a point (in fact its average at two neighbours x, y) as a contour\nH\n(y)\nintegral: \u2202D f dGx,y = 2i\u03c0 f (x)+f\n.\n2\nWe define a derivation with respect\nto Z by \u2202 : C 0 (\u2666) \u2192 C 2 (\u2666) with \u2202f =\nI\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2032\n(x))(\u0233 \u2032 \u2212\u0233)\u2212(x\u0304\u2032 \u2212x\u0304)(f (y \u2032 )\u2212f (y))\ni\nf dZ\u0304 = (f (x )\u2212f\n,\n(x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) 7\u2192 \u2212 2A(x,y,x\n\u2032 ,y \u2032 )\n(x\u2032 \u2212x)(\u0233 \u2032 \u2212\u0233)\u2212(x\u0304\u2032 \u2212x\u0304)(y \u2032 \u2212y)\n(x,y,x\u2032 ,y \u2032 )\n\n \u0304 with f dZ.

As circle patterns with prescribed angles can be\nchecked by eye, so can be a linear holomorphic map: The\nquad-mesh \u2666, when bipartite, decomposes into two dual\ngraphs \u0393 and \u0393\u2217 whose edges are dual diagonals of each\nquadrilateral. Around each vertex x \u2208 \u03930 , there is a polygon, image of the dual face x\u2217 \u2208 \u0393\u22172 by the reference map\nZ. Consider the identity map as a picture of all these\npolygons shrunk by a factor half. It represents both dual\ngraphs at the same time as matching polygons. A map\nf : \u26660 \u2192 C is discrete holomorphic if and only if every\npolygon x\u2217 , centered at f (x), scaled and turned accord- The discrete exponential\ning to \u2202f (x), form into a polygonal pattern of the same as a polygonal pattern on\ncombinatorics as the reference polygonal pattern, made the triangular/hexagonal\nof similar polygons.\nlattice\n \u0304 |\n|+|\u2202f\nThe dilatation coefficient of a discrete map f is defined as Df := |\u2202f\n \u0304 | . We\n|\u2202f |\u2212|\u2202f\nwill call f quasi-conformal when Df \u2265 1, that is |fz\u0304 | \u2264 |\u2202f |. It can be written in\n \u0304\n(x\u2032 )\u2212f (x))(y \u2032 \u2212y)\u2212(x\u2032 \u2212x)(f (y \u2032 )\u2212f (y))\n\u2202f\n= (f\nterm of the complex dilatation: \u03bcf = \u2202f\n(f (x\u2032 )\u2212f (x))(\u0233 \u2032 \u2212\u0233)\u2212(x\u0304\u2032 \u2212x\u0304)(f (y \u2032 )\u2212f (y)) .\nReferences\n[1] Christian Mercat.
