The interaction between our and hidden\nmatter could be transmitted by new abelian U \u2032 (1) gauge bosons A\u2032 mixing with\nordinary photons.

The\nA\u2032 's would then penetrate the downstream shielding and be observed in a neutrino\ndetector via their A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 decays.

Several interesting extensions of the Standard\nModel (SM) dealing with this problem suggest the existence of 'hidden' sectors consisting of SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y singlet fields. These sectors of\nparticles do not interact with the ordinary matter directly and couple to it by\ngravity and possibly by other weak forces. For example, interaction between\nour and hidden matter may be transmitted by a new abelian U \u2032 (1) gauge\nbosons A\u2032 (or hidden photons for short) mixing with ordinary photons, first\ndiscussed by Okun in his paraphoton model [1]. If the mixing strength is very\nweak or the mass scale of a hidden sector is too high, it is experimentally\nunobservable. However, in a class of models the A\u2032 may have mass and mixing\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n10 September 2018\n\n\fstrength lying in the experimentally accessible and theoretically interesting\nregions. This makes further searches for A\u2032 's interesting and attractive, for a\nrecent review see [2], and references therein.\nIn the Lagrangian describing the photon-hidden photon system the only allowed connection between the hidden sector and ours is given by the kinetic\nmixing [1,2,3,4]\n1\nLint = \u2212 \u01ebF\u03bc\u03bd A\u2032\u03bc\u03bd\n(1)\n2\nwhere F \u03bc\u03bd , A\u2032\u03bc\u03bd are the ordinary and the hidden photon fields, respectively,\nand \u01eb is their mixing strength. In the interesting case when A\u2032 has a mass, this\nkinetic mixing can be diagonalized resulting in a non-diagonal mass term that\nmixes photons with hidden-sector photons. It means any source of \u03b3's could\nproduce kinematically possible massive states A\u2032 according to the appropriate\nmixings. Then, when the mass differences are small, photons may oscillate\ninto hidden photons, similarly to vacuum neutrino oscillations, with a vacuum\nmixing angle which is precisely \u01eb. If the mass differences are large, it could\nresults in hidden photon decays, e.g. into e+ e\u2212 pairs.\nExperimental bounds on the sub-eV and sub-keV hidden photons can be obtained from searches for an electromagnetic fifth force [1,5,6], from experiments\nusing the method of photon regeneration [7,8,9,10,11], and from stellar cooling\nconsiderations [12,13]. For example, it has been pointed out that helioscopes\nsearching for solar axions are sensitive to the keV part of the solar spectrum of\nhidden photons and the CAST results [14,15] have been translated into limits\non the \u03b3 \u2212 A\u2032 mixing parameter [16,17,18,19]. Strong bounds on models with\nadditional A\u2032 particles at a low energy scale could be obtained from astrophysical considerations [20]-[22]. However, such astrophysical constraints can\nbe relaxed or evaded in some models, see e.g. [23]. New tests on the existence\nof sub-eV hidden photons at new experimental facilities, such, for example, as\nSHIPS [24] or IAXO [25] are in preparation.\nThe A\u2032 's in the sub-GeV mass range, arising in some models, see e.g. [26,27,28,29],\ncan be explored through the searches for A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 decays in beam dump\nexperiments [30,31,32,33,34,35], or through the rare particle decays, see e.g.\n[36,37,38,39]. For example, if the mass of A\u2032 is below the mass of \u03c0 0 , it can be\neffectively searched for in the decays \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 , with the subsequent decay of\nA\u2032 into e+ e\u2212 pair. Recently, stringent constraints on the mixing \u01eb in sub-GeV\nmass range have been obtained from a search of this decay mode with existing\ndata of neutrino experiments [40,41,42] and from SN1987A cooling [43].\nIt should be noted, that many extensions of the SM such as GUTs [44], supersymmetric [45], super-string models [46] and models including a new long\u2032\nrange interaction, i.e. the fifth force [47], also predict an extra U (1) factor\nand therefore the existence of a new gauge boson X corresponding to this new\n2\n\n\fgroup (we denote it X to distinguish from A\u2032 ). The X's could interact directly\nwith quarks and/or leptons, and although the predictions for its mass are not\nvery firm it could be light enough (MX \u226a MZ ) for searches at low energies.\nIf the mass MX is in the sub-GeV range, i.e. of the order of the pion mass, an\neffective search could be conducted for this new vector boson in the radiative\ndecays of neutral pseudoscalar mesons P \u2192 \u03b3X, where P = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, or \u03b7 \u2032 ,\nbecause the decay rate of P \u2192 \u03b3 + any new particles with spin 0 or 21 proves\nto be negligibly small [48]. Therefore, a positive result in the direct search for\nthese decay modes could be interpreted unambiguously as the discovery of a\nnew light spin 1 particle, in contrast with other experiments searching for light\nweakly interacting particles in rare K, \u03c0 or \u03bc decays [48,49,50].\nStringent limits on the decay \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 (X), A\u2032 (X) \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , obtained by using\nresults from neutrino experiments have been recently reported in Ref. [40].\nThe best experimental limits on the branching ratio of the decay \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3X\nwere obtained by the Crystal Barrel Collaboration at CERN [51,52]. Using\nproton-antiproton annihilation as a source of X's from \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 \u03b3X decays,\nthey searched for the corresponding \u03b3-peak in their detector, resulting in 90\n% C.L. upper limits on the branching ratio Br(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3X) < 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 for MX\nmasses ranging from 200 to 525 MeV, and Br(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3X) < 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 for MX\nbetween 50 MeV and 925 MeV [51,52]. The goal of this Letter is to show that\nmore stringent limits on the decay \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 (X), followed by the decay\nA\u2032 (X) \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , and the mixing \u01eb for A\u2032 masses up to \u2243 500 MeV can be\nobtained from the results of sensitive searches for an excess of single isolated\ne+ e\u2212 pairs from decays of heavy neutrinos in the sub-GeV mass range by the\nCHARM experiment at CERN [53,54].\nThe CHARM Collaboration searched for decays \u03bdh \u2192 \u03bde+ e\u2212 of heavy neutrinos in the \u03bdh mass range from 10 MeV to 1.8 GeV originated from decays \u03c0, K\nand charmed D mesons decays [53,54]. The experiment, specifically designed\nto search for neutrino decays in a high-energy neutrino beam, was performed\nby using 400 GeV protons from the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)\nwith the total number of 2.4\u00d71018 protons on (Cu) target (pot). The CHARM\ndecay detector (DD), located at the distance of 480 m from the target, consist\nof decay volume of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 35 m3 , three chambers modules located inside\nthe volume to detect charged tracks and followed by a calorimeter. The decay\nvolume was essentially an empty region to substantially reduced the number\nof ordinary neutrino interactions. The signature of the heavy neutrino decay\n\u03bdh \u2192 \u03bde+ e\u2212 were events originating in the decay region at a small angle with\nrespect to the neutrino beam axis with one or two separate electromagnetic\nshowers in the calorimeter [54]. No such events were observed and limits were\nestablished on the \u03bde,\u03bc \u2212 \u03bdh mixing strength as a function of the \u03bdh mass. If\nthe decays \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 exist, one expects a flux of high energy A\u2032 's from the\nSPS target, since neutral mesons \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are abundantly produced in the\nforward direction by high energy protons in the target.

The occurrence of A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 decays would appear as an excess of\ne+ e\u2212 pairs in the CHARM DD above those expected from standard neutrino\ninteractions. The experimental signature of these events is clean and they can\nbe selected in the CHARM DD with a small background. As the final states\nof the decays \u03bdh \u2192 \u03bde+ e\u2212 and A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 are identical, the results of the\nsearches for the former can be used to constrain the later for the same e+ e\u2212\ninvariant mass regions.\n\nThe flux of hidden photons from decays of \u03b7's and \u03b7 \u2032 's produced in the target\nby primary protons can be expressed as follows:\n\u2032\n\n\u03a6(A ) \u221d Npot\n\nZ\n\nd3 \u03c3(p + N \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) + X) 2\n\u01eb Br(\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)f d3 p\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 )\nd3 p\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Npot is the number of pot, \u03c3(p + N \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) + X) is the \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) meson production cross-section, Br(\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) is the \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 2\u03b3 decay mode\nbranching fraction [55], and f is the decay phase space factor, respectively.\nTo perform calculations we used simulations of the process shown in Fig.1\nfrom our previous work on \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 decays [40] by taken into account the\nrelative normalization of the yield of different meson species \u03c0 0 : \u03b7 : \u03b7 \u2032 from\nthe original publications.

Coefficients A\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 ) in (4) are normalization factors that\nwere tuned to obtain the cross sections \u03c3\u03b7 and \u03c3\u03b7\u2032 in pp collisions at 400\nGeV/c. In these calculations for the relative yields of \u03c0 0 : \u03b7 : \u03b7 \u2032 mesons the\nvalues 1 : 0.078 : 0.024, respectively, were used, which were obtained from\nthe measurements of the total cross sections \u03c3\u03c00 (127.2 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 3.2 mb) and \u03c3\u03b7\n(9.78 \u00b1 0.56 mb), and from an estimate of the \u03b7 \u2032 production in pp-interactions\nat 400 GeV/c by the NA27 experiment at CERN SPS [57]. The invariant \u03b7\nproduction cross section, obtained by using the B-G parameterization (4), is\nshown in Fig. 2 as a function of pT and rapidity yc.m. in the center of mass\nsystem. The total \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 production cross sections in p-Cu collisions were\ncalculated from its linear extrapolation to the target atomic number. The B5\n\n\fG pT distributions at low transverse momenta were corrected by taking into\naccount the measurements results of \u03c0 0 's and \u03b7's production in 450 GeV pBe and p-Au collisions down to very low pT (& 20 MeV/c) obtained by a\njoint experiment of the TAPS and CERES Collaborations at the CERN SPS\n[58]. In this experiment precise measurement data on \u03b7-production at low pT ,\nrevealed a lower cross section than expected from extrapolating data at higher\npT . The B-G parameterization, found to be in a good agreement with \u03c0 0 data\nfor the full pT range, and also with the \u03b7 data for the large (pT & 0.4 GeV/c)\nmomentum transfer, overestimates the production rate of \u03b7 mesons by 25-30%\nat transverse momenta pT . 0.4 GeV/c. This observation results in decrease\nof the acceptance of the CHARM DD for A\u2032 's produced in \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 decays\nand, hence has to be taken into account. To achieve a better description of\nthe low-pT -region, a parameterization suggested by [58,59] was used:\nd3 \u03c3\n(1 \u2212 xT )c\nE 3 = B\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 ) \u03b2exp(\u2212bmT ) + \u03b1\ndp\n(1 + m2T )4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5)\n\n20\n\n3\n\n17.5\n15\n\n3\n\nEd \u03c3/d p, mb GeV\n\n-2\n\n\u221a\nwhere mT is the transverse mass, xT = 2mT / s, and parameters \u03b2 = 0.15, b =\n6.5 GeV\u22121 , \u03b1 = 0.011, c = 7.9 and normalization factors B\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 ) were determined in Ref.[58] by fitting the precise low pT experimental data in the rapidity\nrange 3 < y < 4. The results of fitting were also in good agreement with other\nmeson production data obtained for different rapidity intervals. The comparison of two parameterizations is shown in Fig. 3.

For a\ngiven flux d\u03a6(MA\u2032 , EA\u2032 , Npot )/dEA\u2032 of A\u2032 's the expected number of A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212\ndecays occurring within the fiducial length L of the CHARM detector located\nat a distance L\u2032 from the neutrino target is given by\n\nZ\n\nNA\u2032 \u2192e+ e\u2212 = Br(\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 )Br(A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )\nL\u2032 MA\u2032\n*exp \u2212\nPA\u2032 \u03c4A\u2032\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0014\n\nLMA\u2032\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212\nPA\u2032 \u03c4A\u2032\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\nd\u03a6\ndEA\u2032\n(6)\n\n\u03b6AdEA\u2032\n\nwhere EA\u2032 , PA\u2032 , and \u03c4A\u2032 are the A\u2032 energy, momentum and the lifetime at rest,\nrespectively, and \u03b6 is the e+ e\u2212 pair reconstruction efficiency. The acceptance A\nof the DD was calculated tracing A\u2032 's produced in the Cu-target to the detector\ntaking the relevant momentum and angular distributions into account. As an\nexample for a mass MA\u2032 = 300 MeV, A = 0.07 and \u03b6 \u2243 0.6 [53]. In this\nestimate the average momentum is < pA\u2032 >\u2243 35 GeV and L \u2243 10 m.\nThe obtained results can be used to impose constraints on the previously\ndiscussed models with A\u2032 hidden photons. For A\u2032 masses below the mass M\u03b7(\u03b7\u2032 )\nof \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) meson, the corresponding branching fraction of the decay \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 ,\nis given by [26,27]:\nM2\u2032\nBr(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3A ) = 2\u01eb Br(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) 1 \u2212 A2\nM\u03b7\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u00133\n\n(7)\n\nwith the similar expression for the \u03b7 \u2032 decay.

Using similar considerations the exclusion area for the\n7\n\n\fFig. 4. Exclusion region in the (MA\u2032 ; \u01eb) plane obtained in the present work from\nthe results of the CHARM experiment [53,54]. The areas excluded from the (g-2)\nconsiderations, the results of the Nomad [40] and electron beam dump experiments\nE137 [30,31], E141 [33], E774 [34], and from the searches by APEX [35], KLOE[36],\nBaBar[38] and MAMI [39] are also shown for comparison.\n\ndecay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 has been also obtained. However, due to the lower \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section and a small branching fraction of the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 this\nexclusion area falls basically within that of obtained for \u03b7 decays. Note, that\nthe uncertainty for the \u03b7 production at low pT does not significantly affect the\nlimits derived. For example, the variation of the \u03b7 yield in (6) by 25% results\nin the corresponding variation of the limits on mixing strength \u01eb of the order\nof 5%. This is because the sensitivity of the search is proportional to the \u01eb4 .\nIndeed, in (6) the branching fraction of (7) and the decay rate \u0393(A\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )\nof (8) both are proportional to \u01eb2 .\nWe can also constrain models where the previously discussed X bosons interact\nwith both quarks and leptons. The 90% C.L. upper limits on the Br(\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192\n\u03b3X)Br(X \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) vs X lifetime \u03c4X shown in Fig. 5 were calculated by\nusing the relation Ne90%\n+ e\u2212 > NX\u2192e+ e\u2212 and Eq.(6).

The numbers near the\ncurves indicate the corresponding values of MX .\n\nboth quarks and leptons can be written in the form:\nLX = gX (QBX B i + QeX Lie + Q\u03bcX Li\u03bc + Q\u03c4 X Li\u03c4 )X i\n\n(9)\n\n2\nwhere \u03b1X = gX\n/4\u03c0 is the coupling constant, B i = q=u,d,s,.. q\u03b3 i q, Lie = e\u03b3 i e +\n\u03bd eL \u03b3 i \u03bdeL , ..., see e.g. [48,50].

For the mass\nrange from 270 to M\u03b7 (548 MeV) the decay channel X \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 is open. To\ncalculate this decay rate is not a simple task, because the QCD long distance\neffects have to be taken into account [49]. Therefore, to avoid this difficulty,\nwe used for this decay rate a reasonable estimate \u0393(X \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0) \u2243 \u03b1X Q2BX MX ,\n9\n\n\fwhich results in k = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221212 for QBX \u2243 1. From the similar considerations, for the mass range M\u03b7 < MX < M\u03b7\u2032 (948 MeV) the limit on the\ncoupling constant is given by (10) with replacements k = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 and\nM\u03b7\u2032 instead of M\u03b7 . The bounds (10) are valid for \u03c4X & 10\u221210 MX [MeV] s.\nThey are more restrictive than those obtained in [49,50], and than bounds reported by NOMAD [42]. Less stringent limits (by a factor \u2243 \u03b1) could be\nobtained for the cases where the X interacts only with leptons, or when\nit is a leptophobic boson which interacts only with quarks and decays into\ne+ e\u2212 pair through the quark loop [49,50]. For X produced in \u03b7 decay with\nthe masses MX < 545 MeV/c2 the best limits from CHARM are in the\nregion Br(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3X)Br(X \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) . (2 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221214 , while the corresponding limits for X's with masses MX < 948 MeV/c2 from \u03b7 \u2032 decays are\nBr(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3X)Br(X \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) . 2 \u00d7 10\u221212 . The attenuation of the X- flux due\nto X interactions with matter was found to be negligible, e.g. for couplings of\n(10) the X boson mean free path in iron is much longer, as compared with the\niron and earth shielding total length of 0.4 km used for the CHARM beam.\nIn summary, using sensitive limits from the CHARM experiments on heavy\nneutrino decays \u03bdh \u2192 \u03bde+ e\u2212 , new bounds on a hidden sector gauge A\u2032 bosons\nproduced in the neutral meson decay \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 \u03b3A\u2032 in the sub-GeV A\u2032 mass\nrange are obtained. The A\u2032 's could mediate interaction between our world and\nhidden sectors consisting of SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y singlet fields through\nthe mixing with ordinary photons. For the A\u2032 mass region 1 . MA\u2032 . 500\nMeV the obtained exclusion area covers the \u03b3 \u2212 A\u2032 mixing strength in the\nrange 10\u22127 . \u01eb . 10\u22124 . The results obtained are also applicable to the \u03b7\nand \u03b7 \u2032 decays into a photon and a new gauge bosons X that interacts with\nquarks and leptons, or only with quarks. Our best result is sensitive to a\nbranching ratio Br(\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) \u2192 \u03b3X) & 10\u221214 (10\u221212 ), which is about nine (eight)\norders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit from the Crystal Ball\nexperiment[51,52]. The obtained constraints were used to set new limits on\nthe X coupling strength to lepton and quarks which are more restrictive than\nbounds from previous searches. These results enhance existing motivations for\nfurther more sensitive search for A\u2032 (X) decay at the high intensity frontier\n[60] and additional tests of hidden sectors in neutrino experiments.\nThe help of V.D.
