Geissler and Eugene I. Shakhnovich\nDepartment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138\nWe present an analytical theory for heteropolymer deformation, as exemplified experimentally\nby stretching of single protein molecules. Using a mean-field replica theory, we determine phase\ndiagrams for stress-induced unfolding of typical random sequences. This transition is sharp in the\nlimit of infinitely long chain molecules. But for chain lengths relevant to biological macromolecules,\npartially unfolded conformations prevail over an intermediate range of stress. These necklace-like\nstructures, comprised of alternating compact and extended subunits, are stabilized by quenched\nvariations in the composition of finite chain segments. The most stable arrangements of these\nsubunits are largely determined by preferential extension of segments rich in solvophilic monomers.\nThis predicted significance of necklace structures explains recent observations in protein stretching\nexperiments. We examine the statistical features of select sequences that give rise to mechanical\nstrength and may thus have guided the evolution of proteins that carry out mechanical functions in\nliving cells.\n\nsimulations with atomistic detail [8,9]. But due to the\ncomputational expense of such simulations, they provide\nonly anecdotal insight into the relationship between sequence and mechanical strength.\nA general understanding of heteropolymer deformation\ncan only be obtained by considering the ensemble of possible sequences. We have recently described the results\nof an analytical theory that takes the diversity of this\nensemble properly into account [10]. Specifically, the\nfree energies of various conformational states are averaged over the distribution of sequences, using the replica\ntrick [11]. In this way, the mechanical response typical\nof random heteropolymers is determined. This article\npresents our theoretical approach in detail.\nBecause we focus on equilibrium free energetics, our\ntheory directly applies only to reversible stretching, i.e.,\npulling rates that are much slower than rates of spontaneous unfolding. Stretching experiments, on the other\nhand, have been performed irreversibly, as evidenced\nby wide hysteresis [1]. Relating theoretical results to\nthese experiments is made possible by an identity for\nnonequilibrium dynamics obtained by Jarzynski [12] and\nby Crooks [13]. In particular, Hummer and Szabo have\nshown that reversible stretching behavior may be extracted from repeated nonequilibrium measurements [14].\nEquilibrium results determined in this way differ only in\ndetails from their nonequilibrium counterparts. For example, the threshold force required to unfold a mechanical protein reversibly is smaller than the corresponding\nnonequilibrium value, but the induced transition remains\nsharp [14]. Qualitative predictions of our theory are thus\nrelevant to current experiments. Direct comparisons are\npossible in principle when experimental measurements\nhave been repeated sufficiently.\nThe coarse features of heteropolymer response do not\ndiffer significantly from those of a homopolymer. In poor\nsolvent (T < \u03b8), a chain molecule is transformed by stress\nfrom collapsed globule to expanded coil. This transformation occurs abruptly for homopolymers, as determined\nby scaling analysis [15]. Globule deformation is strongly\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral recent experiments have highlighted the mechanical strength of proteins involved in muscle elasticity and cell adhesion [1\u20133]. When pulled from the\nends, these molecules can withstand significant stress before their constituent domains unfold from compact native states to extended coil-like structures. This stressinduced unfolding occurs sharply, with threshold forces\nft on the order of 100 pN. In natural units for these systems, ft \u223c 100kB T /a, where kB is Boltzmann's constant\n(which we subsequently set to unity), T is temperature,\nand a \u2243 1 nm is the size of a typical amino acid. By\ncontrast, studies of proteins whose functions are not mechanical in nature have revealed lower threshold forces\n(ft \u223c 10kB T /a) and less dramatic stretching behavior\n[4,5]. Specifically, relative fluctuations in restoring force\nare considerably larger than for mechanical proteins, and\nthe stretching transition is less sharply defined. Evolution therefore appears to have designed certain proteins\nto unfold reproducibly under critical stress.\nResults of computer simulations have lent details to\nthis notion of mechanical design. Random heteropolymers on a lattice, which may be viewed as coarsegrained caricatures of proteins, exhibit stretching behavior that depends strongly on the sequence of constituent monomers [6]. Typical random sequences elongate smoothly under stress, passing through one or more\nlong-lived, partially extended structures. Sequences selected for their ability to fold rapidly in the absence of\nstress, however, undergo a relatively sharp force-induced\ntransition. Folding efficiency is thus correlated with mechanical strength to some extent. But reaction coordinates for protein folding are only loosely coupled to the\nsimple mechanical variables manipulated in stretching\nexperiments [7]. In an ensemble of fast-folding sequences,\na range of mechanical stabilities is therefore expected,\ndue to variations in sequence properties that do not affect folding dynamics. Native state topology may be one\nsuch property, according to results of protein stretching\n\n1\n\n\fresisted by the cost of enlarging the polymer-solvent interface, while a coil is quite pliable. The \"phase transition\" between these states is thus accompanied by a sharp\nchange in extension. At phase coexistence, the free energetic equivalence of globule and coil gives rise to necklacelike structures, in which compact and expanded subunits\nalternate within the chain (as sketched in Fig. 1). In the\ncase of homopolymers, these partially extended structures are unstable away from coexistence. A phase diagram for homopolymer stretching is constructed from\nthis physical picture in Sec. II.\nNecklace structures figure more prominently in the\ncases of polyelectrolytes and polyampholytes. When\na significant fraction of monomers carry charge, fully\ncompact conformations are unstable, in analogy to the\nRayleigh instability of charged droplets [16]. As a result, the chain segregates into a series of smaller, tethered globules. Such necklaces are the ground states of\nsufficiently charged polyelectrolytes, even in the absence\nof stress. Stretching these molecules modifies the the\ndetails of structural partitioning, reducing the sizes and\nnumbers of compact subunits and lengthening the stringlike subunits that connect them [17,18].\nNecklaces play an enhanced role in heteropolymer\nstretching as well, although for different reasons. The\nquenched disorder of random sequences lends different\ndegrees of mechanical susceptibility to different regions\nof the chain. Depending on the extent of this heterogeneity, necklace structures may dominate over an appreciable range of stress. In effect, the globule-coil coexistence\nregion is broadened by disorder. In Sec. III, we determine\nthe magnitude of this broadening by analyzing a microscopic model for heteropolymer deformation. For uncorrelated sequence statistics, we show that necklaces are\nstabilized over a stress interval of relative width N \u22121/2 ,\nwhere N is the number of monomers per molecule. The\neffects of correlations within a sequence, also examined\nin Sec. III, suggest that certain statistical patterns are\nstrongly correlated with mechanical strength. These patterns are consistent with the structures of mechanical\nproteins designed by evolution.\nIn seeking a microscopic explanation for the stretching behavior of proteins, we focus on the effects of heteropolymeric disorder. Electrostatic effects are expected\nto influence protein stability less strongly at physiological\nconditions [19,20]. We also focus on the response to external stress, rather than to strain. Although the extension of protein molecules is constrained in experiments,\nthe flexibility of unfolded segments in these modular\nstructures mediates the applied strain. Indeed, provided\nthe contour lengths of unfolded regions, simple elastic\nmodels account for the measured restoring forces of modular proteins. Individual, folded domains are thus effectively subjected to uniform external stress. The model we\nanalyze in Sec. III is tailored to these external conditions\nappropriate for experiments and for biological function.\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic example of a necklace-like polymeric\nstructure. Some regions of the chain adopt locally compact, globular conformations, while others exist in extended\ncoil-like states.\nII. HOMOPOLYMER STRETCHING\n\nWe employ simple, mean-field descriptions of the conformational states relevant to polymer deformation. For\ninstance, the free energy of a homopolymer globule relative to that of an ideal coil,\nFg (N ) \u2243 B0 \u03c1N + \u03b3N 2/3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nis dominated by the effective interactions between\nmonomers. Here, \u03c1 is the monomer density, and \u03b3 is\nthe surface tension of the globule-solvent interface. The\nenergy density of monomer attractions, B0 = T \u2212 \u03b8, stabilizes the compact state for T < \u03b8. We focus on temperatures below the \u03b8-region, for which the globule is\nhighly compact, i.e., \u03c1v \u223c 1, where v is the volume of a\nmonomer. At this level of description, the contribution\nof stress to Eq. 1 is negligible within the regime of globule\nstability.\nWe represent the coil state by a freely jointed chain\nwith segment length a. This model provides the simplest description of polymer flexibility that ensures a finite maximum chain extension, N a. This condition is\nimportant at low temperatures, where the coil is highly\nextended under stress. The free energy of coil deformation is easily computed from this model [21]:\nFc (N ) = \u2212N T ln [y(f a/T )],\n\n(2)\n\nwhere y(x) = sinh (x)/x. The stretching force at which\nthis extended coil coexists with the compact state is determined by equating Fc and Fg :\n\u0010\n\u0011\nft = y \u22121 exp [\u2212(B + \u03b3N \u22121/3 )/T ] T /a.\n(3)\n\nThis phase boundary is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 2 for various N . Qualitative features of these\nphase diagrams for homopolymer stretching compare well\nwith results of lattice polymer simulations [6]. At low\ntemperatures, a reentrant coil phase appears. This rodlike state involves small fluctuations about a fully extended structure, as has been noted in simulation work\n[22]. Similar reentrance has been predicted for the mechanical unzipping of DNA at low temperatures [23,24].\n\n2\n\n\f1.5\n\nN =1\nN = 1000\nN = 100\n\nx1\n\n1.0\n\nf a=\u0012\n\nx2\nx3\n\n0.5\n\nglobule\n\ncoil\n\nu\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nT =\u0012\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nx1\n\nIII. HETEROPOLYMER STRETCHING\n\nHeterogeneity of monomer types has several consequences for the deformation scenario described above.\nFirst, the fully compact state is dominated by only a\nfew distinct conformations at low temperature. The corresponding freezing transition has been analyzed thoroughly [25,26]. For necklace structures, each compact\nsubunit can freeze in this way. Because the composition\nof these subunits is randomly distributed, the details of\nfreezing will differ for each. Specifically, each subunit\nwill have a different ground state energy, and thus a different stability. In addition, variations in sequence composition will strongly influence the solvation energetics\nof expanded subunits. As a result, the susceptibility of\na given region of the chain to extension is effectively a\nrandom variable. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nWe weigh these effects of disorder using a microscopic\nmodel of random heteropolymers. For a particular realization of monomer identities, \u03c3i , the energy of a chain\nconformation is\nX\nH = H0 + \u0393\n\u03c3i \u2212 f * (rN \u2212 r1 ),\n(4)\ni,j=1\n\n\u03b4(ri \u2212 rj )(B0 + \u03c7\u03c3i \u03c3j ).\n\nx\n\nbetween connected monomers i and i+1 to be distributed\naccording to a function g(|ri+1 \u2212 ri |) with range a. Unconnected monomers i and j interact only when they are\nin contact, as described by the Dirac delta function in\nEq. 5. The heteropolymeric part of this interaction depends on the identities of the monomers involved. Two\nmonomer types, \u03c3i = \u00b11, are possible at each point in\nthe sequence. These types could represent, for example, amino acids with hydrophilic and hydrophobic side\nchains. We choose \u03c7 < 0, so that each monomer attracts\nothers of the same type most strongly. The sequence\nof monomer types \u03c3i is fixed for each realization of the\nheteropolymer. As in related problems, this quenched\ndisorder requires careful treatment.\nThe second term in Eq. 4 describes the solvation energetics of monomers that are exposed to the external environment. The sum extends only over the set S of exposed\nmonomers. Depending implicitly on chain conformation,\nthis term mimics a many-body aspect of the hydrophobic\neffect, the tendency to bury unfavorably solvated regions\nof a solute. We take \u0393 > 0, so that monomers of type\n\u03c3i = \u22121 are preferentially solvated, In the following sections, we analyze the energetics of Eqs. 4 and 5 for the\nconformational states important to mechanical response.\nWith these results, we construct phase diagrams for heteropolymer stretching.\n\ni\u2208S\n\nH0 =\n\nx3\n\nFIG. 3. Random potential u(x) representing the dependence of necklace energy on the sequence location x of a globular subunit. Filled and unfilled circles denote monomers of\ntwo different types. Because the local composition of the sequence differs at x1 , x2 , and x3 , globular regions at these\nlocations will have different ground state energies. More importantly, the composition of exposed coil regions differs for\nthe three cases. For a random sequence of monomers, the\ntotal necklace energy is thus a random variable for different\nsubunit arrangements. The statistics of these variations determine the size of random fluctuations, \u2206u.\n\nFIG. 2. Phase diagram for homopolymer stretching computed from Eq. 3.

The connectivity of consecutive monomers is implicit in Eq. 4. We take the links\n3\n\n\f*Z\n\nA. Globule\n\nThe first term in Eq. 4, H0 , defines a model of a random copolymer in the absence of explicit solvation energetics (\u0393 = 0) and stretching force (f = 0). A mean\nfield theory for the globular state of this model was analyzed in Ref. [26] using the replica trick. At a critical\ntemperature, Tc , the heteropolymer freezes into O(1) low\nenergy conformations. This transition is accompanied by\none-step replica symmetry breaking, indicating that the\nhierarchy of basins of attraction in conformation space\nis one level deep. This result is consistent with a random energy model of the system. In other words, the\ndensity of states is well represented by drawing energies\nat random from a Gaussian distribution, P (E), with appropriate mean, E, and variance, \u2206. Our analysis of\nthe globular state for the model defined by Eq. 4 (with\nnonzero \u0393 and f ) closely follows that of Ref. [26]. We\nfocus on the way in which solvation modifies the effective\ndistribution of energies. As in the homopolymeric case,\nwe neglect the effect of stretching force on globule free\nenergetics.\nIn order to compute properties characteristic of an\nensemble of random heteropolymers, we must average\nover their sequences. Because the disordered sequence\nis quenched, the average is correctly performed on the\nlogarithm of the partition function, Z, rather than on Z\nitself.

(21)\nth\n\nWe will approximate the integral in Eq. 18 by optimizing\nthe free energy with respect to replica overlap.\nWe imagine that a hierarchy exists for basins of attraction in conformation space, as is done in the theory\nof spin glasses [11]. It is then natural to sort replicas\ninto groups, such that replicas belonging to the same\ngroup overlap most strongly This grouping determines\nthe structure of Q\u03b1\u03b2 . If \u03b1 and \u03b2 are in the same group,\nQ\u03b1\u03b2 (R1 , R2 ) is nearly \u03c1\u03b4(R1 \u2212 R2 ). If \u03b1 and \u03b2 belong\nto widely different groups, Q\u03b1\u03b2 (R1 , R2 ) \u2248 0. The onestep replica symmetry breaking demonstrated in Ref. [26]\nis not altered by the solvation energetics in Eq. 4, because the scaling properties of Q\u03b1\u03b2 are unchanged. Consequently, overlap between replicas is binary:\n\u001a\n\u03c1, for \u03b1, \u03b2 in the same group,\nQ\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 (k) =\n(22)\n0, for \u03b1, \u03b2 in different groups.\nNote that Q\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 (k) is independent of k, since replica overlap is either absent or microscopically complete. Together with the number of replicas in each group, Eq. 22\nspecifies Q\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 (k) completely.\nThe limit n \u2192 0 in Eq. 6 is most conveniently taken\nusing a continuous representation of the replica overlap\nmatrix. In this limit, the \"number\" of replicas in a group,\nx0 , lies between 0 and 1, and summations over replica\n\nwhere\nP\u03b1\u03b2 (k) = \u2212b\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + 2\u03bc2 b2 Q\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 (k).\n\nXX\n\n(17)\n\nIn Eq. 16 we have omitted the first exponential of Eq. 13,\nwhich contributes an irrelevant multiplicative constant.\nFollowing the analysis of Ref.

[26] using\nthe continuous form of Q\u03b1\u03b2 introduced by Parisi:\nln [det P\u03b1\u03b2 ] = ln b +\n\nln(1 \u2212 \u03b3x0 )\n,\nx0\n\n(23)\n\nE\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 2b\u03bc2 \u03c1. We evaluate the second term in Eq. 20\nusing identities derived in Ref.

The loss of\nentropy due to the grouping of replicas described by Q\u03b1\u03b2\nwas also computed in Ref. [26] as S = N nS/x0 . Here,\ns = ln a3 /v is the entropy loss per monomer of constraining a replica to correspond to other replicas in its group at\na microscopic level. Combining these results, and noting\nthat wavevector summations contribute only unimportant factors of volume, we obtain the replica free energy\ndensity:\n\nFIG. 4. Schematic effect of solvation on the distribution\nof globule energies. Low-lying energy levels, as well as the essentially continuous part of the energy spectrum, are sketched\nat left for a heteropolymer without differential solvation of\nmonomer types. Surface energetics reorder these levels on a\nscale \u0393N 2/3 (as shown at right). The basic form of the distribution is unchanged.\n\nF (x0 )\nln (1 \u2212 \u03b3x0 ) c2\nA\ns\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b3x0 )\u22121 \u2212 .\n= ln b +\nnN\nx0\n4b\nN\nx0\n\nE < E + N 1/2 \u2206. At energies just below a critical\nvalue, E \u2217 = E \u2212 N \u2206s1/2 , the number of states is\nO(1), while just above E \u2217 the number is exponentially\nlarge. The ground states of particular random sequences\nare distributed narrowly about E \u2217 [28]. Solvation thus\nlowers the average ground state energy by an amount\n(\u03932 \u03c1/4|\u03c7|)s1/2 A.\nSolvation of the globule surface selects a ground state\nfrom the set of conformations with monomer interaction\nenergies E < E \u2217 + \u0393N 2/3 . This selection is illustrated in\nFig. 4. If the energy scale of solvation is small, |\u0393| \u226a |\u03c7|,\nthe shift in ground state energy will be a negligible fraction of the optimum surface energy, \u0393\u03c1A. In this case,\nthe set of low-energy conformations from which to select\nis small, and it is unlikely that one of these conformations presents a predominantly solvophilic surface. If, on\nthe other hand, |\u0393| \u2248 |\u03c7|, solvation can be an important factor in determining the ground state. In this case,\nthere is a reasonable probability that a conformation with\nE < E \u2217 + \u0393N 2/3 has favorable solvation energy. Here,\nthe shift in ground state energy will be comparable to\n\u0393\u03c1A, and the surface of the native state will be largely\nsolvophilic. This solvation effect does not strongly influence the freezing behavior studied in Ref. [26]. But\nit does represent the energetic contribution most sensitive to variations in sequence composition. It is therefore\nsignificant for our analysis of necklace structures.\n\n(25)\nEq. 25 differs from the corresponding result in Ref. [26]\nonly by the term proportional to A/N \u223c N \u22121/3 .\nWe now employ a mean field approximation by optimizing the free energy density with respect to x0 . (Because the number of pairs of replicas is negative in the\nlimit n \u2192 0, the appropriate extremum is in fact a maximum of F (x0 ).) To lowest nonvanishing order in x0 , the\nmean field solution is\ns\n2s\n\u22121\nx0 = \u03b3\n.\n(26)\n1 + c2 A/2b\u03b3N\nFrom Eq. 26, we may identify the transition temperature,\nTc , may be identified at which freezing occurs, i.e., at\nwhich x0 first deviates from unity:\nTc = (2s)\u22121/2 (\u22122\u03c7\u03bc2 \u03c1 \u2212\n\n\u03932 A\n) + O(N \u22122/3 ).\n4\u03c7N\n\n(27)\n\nComparing this result with Eq. 3.9 of Ref. [26], we find\nthat the solvation term in Eq. 4 raises Tc by an amount\n\u223c N \u22121/3 .\nTogether with the average energy of non-native conformations, the freezing temperature in Eq. 27 determines\nthe parameters of a random energy model corresponding\nto the random heteropolymer. The effective distribution\nof energies is given by\n\nB. Coil\n\nP (E) = (2\u03c0)1/2 exp [\u2212(E \u2212 E)2 /N \u22062 ],\n(28)\n\u221a\nwhere \u2206 = 2sTc and E = B0 \u03c1N . This distribution\nis dominated by states in the interval E \u2212 N 1/2 \u2206 <\n\nFor the coil state of a heteropolymer, we must add solvation energetics to the free energy in Eq. 2. For simplicity, we consider only random sequences whose total com6\n\n\fP\nposition is fixed by i \u03c3i = 0. Since nearly all monomers\nare exposed to solvent in the expanded coil state, this\nconstraint causes the solvation energy in Eq. 4 to vanish. Thus, the free energy of this heteropolymeric coil is\nidentical to that of the homopolymeric coil discussed in\nSec. II. In the next section, we consider necklace structures of a random heteropolymer. In these structures,\nshort segments of the chain exist in coil-like states. The\nsequence composition of these exposed segments is not\nconstrained, and the solvation energy need not vanish.\nWe will show this to be an important stabilizing effect\nfor necklace structures.\n\nIn effect, each segment of the sequence has a different associated random energy model. A globular subunit will\ntherefore have a different ground state energy for each\nlocation in the sequence. Specifically, the local value of\nq shifts the mean energy by an amount \u03c7q 2 \u03c1M + \u0393q\u03c1A,\nand reduces\nthe variance of monomer identities, \u03bc, by a\np\nfactor 1 \u2212 q 2 . As a result, the characteristic ground\nstate energy in a sequence region with composition q is\nE \u2217 = B0 \u03c1M + \u03c7q 2 \u03c1M + \u0393q\u03c1A\n+\u03c7\u03bc2 (1 \u2212 q 2 )\u03c1M + O(M 1/3 ).\n\nVariations in E \u2217 along the sequence contribute to the\nrandom potential u(x). The magnitude of this contribution is computed by averaging variations in E \u2217 over the\ndistribution of q in Eq. 29:\nq\nh(\u03b4E \u2217 )2 iq \u223c \u0393\u03bc\u03c1M 1/6 .\n(33)\n\nC. Necklace structures\n\nFor a random heteropolymer, the numbers and sizes of\nglobular subunits do not provide an adequate description\nof a necklace-like structure. Due to the heterogeneity of\nmonomer interactions, the energy of such a structure depends as well on the arrangement of subunits within the\nsequence. This dependence on globule location, x, can be\nrepresented as the effect of an external, random potential\nu(x) with fluctuations of size \u2206u, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nIf \u2206u is large, it is likely that a particular arrangement\nlies much lower in energy than others. Over some range\nof stretching forces, it is possible that such low-energy\nnecklace structures are preferred over pure globule and\ncoil states. In this case, necklaces will play a significant role in the response to stretching. Our analysis\nof heteropolymeric necklaces is guided by this perspective. First, we characterize the statistics of the effective\nrandom potential. We then identify situations in which\nquenched disorder stabilizes necklace structures significantly.\nAlthough we take sequence composition to be fixed for\nthe chain as a whole, the composition q of local regions\nis distributed according to\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\np(q) \u221d exp \u2212 q 2 (\n(29)\n\u2212 )\u22121 ,\n2\nM\nN\nX\n1\nq=\n\u03c3i ,\n(30)\nM i\u2208segment\n\nFluctuations in u(x) due to energetics of a globular region\nof length M thus arise from solvation at leading order,\nand grow rather slowly with increasing M .\nVariations in the solvation of coil regions are more sizable. In a region of length M and composition q, the\nsolvation energy is \u0393qM . Fluctuations of this energy are\nof size \u0393\u03bcM 1/2 (1 \u2212 M/N )\u22121/2 . These variations are considerably larger than those of globule energetics for large\nM , and set the scale of \u2206u. We show below that this solvation effect is sufficient to stabilize necklace structures\nfor long but finite chains.\nWe focus on necklace structures including m globular\nregions, each with M monomers. Thermodynamics of\nthis class of structures may be approximated by drawing \u03a9 values at random from a Gaussian distribution\nwith variance \u2206u. Here, \u03a9 is the number of statistically\nindependent arrangements of the globular regions, \u03a9 \u2248\n[M \u2212m (N \u2212M +1)(N \u22122M +1) . . . (N \u2212mM +1)/m!]. The\nthermodynamics of large systems with independently distributed random energies are well known [28,29]. In this\ncase, the free energy of spontaneous fluctuations in the\nrandom potential u(x) is given by\n\u001a\n\u2212 ln \u03a9 T [1 + (Tl /T )2 ], T > Tl\nFrand (M, m) =\n(34)\n\u22122 ln \u03a9 Tl ,\nT \u2264 Tl .\n\nwhere M is the length of the segment. Because different segments of the sequence have different compositions,\ntheir local free energetics will vary. In a region with composition q, the apparent distribution of monomer types\nis modified from Eq. 12,\nw(\u03c3i ; q) \u221d exp [\u2212(\u03c3i \u2212 q)2 /2(1 \u2212 q 2 )\u03bc2 ].\n\n(32)\n\nIn Eq. 34, Tl = \u0393\u03bc(mM )1/2 (1 \u2212 mM/N )1/2 /(2 ln \u03a9)1/2\nis the temperature at which globular regions become localized in the sequence. For T < Tl , the necklace has a\nfrozen arrangement of subunits, and does not reorganize.\nCombining Eq. 34 with Eqs. 1 and 2, we obtain the total\nfree energy of a necklace structure,\n\n(31)\n\nFneck(M, m) = mFg (M ) + Fc (N \u2212 mM ) + Frand (M, m).\n\nThese modified sequence statistics alter the local distribution of energies, for both globule and coil subunits.\nIn the context of the random energy model discussed in\nSec. III.A, the variation in local sequence statistics modulates the mean and variance of conformational energies.\n\n(35)\nThe pure globule and coil states of a heteropolymer are\nalso described by Eq. 35 for M = N and M = 0, respectively.\n7\n\n\f(a)\n\n1.5\n\nN = 100\n\n0.050\n\nf a=\u0012\n\nFne k (M; m\n\nexp [\n\ncoil\n\n1.0\n0.030\n\n\u0003\n\nM )=T \u2104\n\n0.040\n\nnecklace\n\n0.020\n\n0.5\n\nglobule\n\n0.010\n\n0.000\n\n20.0\n\n40.0\n\nM\n\n60.0\n\n80.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n100.0\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 5. Distribution of necklace structures, p(M ), for the\nthermodynamic state T = 0.5\u03b8, f = 0.95\u03b8/a with N = 100.\nNecklaces consisting of a single large globule (M = O(N ))\nand short coil regions are most probable at these conditions. But necklaces with many small globules (M \u226a N )\nare also strongly represented. Globules of intermediate size\n(M \u2248 N/2) occur with a small but nonnegligible probability.\nA minimum size of 5 monomers is chosen for globular regions.\n\n0.5\n\nT =\u0012\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nN = 1000\ncoil\n\nf a=\u0012\n\n1.0\n\nnecklace\n0.5\n\nThe scaling of Eq. 34 suggests that the distribution of\nglobular region sizes may be quite broad. For a necklace with small globules (M \u226a N ), Frand is optimized\nwith a large number of regions, m = O(N ). In this case,\nFrand \u223c N 1/2 . For large globules, the constraint that\nmM < N requires that m = O(1). In this case as well,\nFrand \u223c N 1/2 . Surface effects will yield a preference for\na small number of large globular regions, but this scaling\nindicates that a broad ensemble of globule sizes may be\nimportant at a single thermodynamic state. This possibility is demonstrated in Fig. 5, inPwhich the distribution\n\u2032\nof globule sizes, p(M ) \u221d exp [\u2212 m Fneck(M, m)/T ], is\nplotted as a function of M for a thermodynamic state\nnear the globule-coil transition. Here, primed sums are\nrestricted to m \u2264 N/M . The weight of necklaces consisting of a single large globule is comparable to that of\nnecklaces comprised of many small globules. As a result,\nfluctuations in polymer extension are considerable near\nthe transition.\nWe determine a phase diagram for stretching of random heteropolymers by computing the total fraction of\nmonomers belonging to globular regions, \u03c6g :\nP P\u2032\nmM exp [\u2212Fneck(m, M )/T ]\n.\n(36)\n\u03c6g \u2243 M\nP m\nP\u2032\nM\nm exp [\u2212Fneck (m, M )/T ]\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\nglobule\n\n0.5\n\nT =\u0012\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 6.\nPhase diagrams for random heteropolymer\nstretching computed from Eq. 36. Shaded regions mark a\nnecklace phase, in which the fraction of monomers belonging\nto globular regions lies between 0.05 and 0.95. For these calculations, we have chosen the scale of monomer solvation energetics to coincide with that of interactions between monomers,\n\u0393 \u2248 \u03b8. We have also chosen the variance of monomer identities, \u03bc, to be unity.\n\ntransition from globule to coil. This result is consistent\nwith simulated stretching of a short (N = 27) random\nheteropolymer, suggesting that intermediates states described in Ref. [6] should be identified with the necklace\nstructures we consider here. But the stabilization of necklaces arising from Frand scales only as N 1/2 , and is overcome for long chains by O(N ) contributions of the first\ntwo terms in Eq. 34. The range of stretching forces over\nwhich necklaces are stable is therefore significantly diminished for N = 1000, and vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e. Stretching behavior of infinitely long random heteropolymers\nis indistinguishable from that of homopolymers. But for\nchain lengths relevant to macromolecules, necklace structures can play an important role. The large fluctuations\nin extension accompanying these structures explains the\nobserved stretching behavior of proteins like barnase [5]\nthat are not designed for mechanical functions.\n\nWhen \u03c6g > 0.05, we consider the heteropolymer to be\nin a globular state. Similarly, when \u03c6g < 0.95, we consider it to be in a coil state. In the intermediate regime,\n0.05 < \u03c6g < 0.95, necklace structures are prevalent. Results are plotted in Fig. 6. For N = 100, the extent\nof the necklace phase prevents the possibility of a sharp\n\n8\n\n\fwith widely distributed hydrophobic groups. The compact native structures of such molecules generally include\nimportant contacts linking distant segments of the chain.\nIt is in part this topology imposed by nonlocal contacts\nthat provides a collective resistance to strain. Indeed,\na common structural motif of mechanical proteins, \u03b2sheet secondary structure, is typically rich in nonlocal\nhydrophobic contacts. The elements of sequence statistics we predict to be favorable for mechanical strength\nare thus related to topological features of the native state\nsuggested by computer simulations [8,9]. It will be interesting to see how these basic principles compare with simulations of evolutionary design for mechanical strength.\nFor commonly used, coarse-grained models of proteins,\nsuch simulations should be feasible using current computational resources and are currently underway in our\nlaboratory.\n\nD. Sequence statistics\n\nIn the previous section we showed that the distribution of local sequence compositions plays an important\nrole in the stretching of heteropolymers with uncorrelated\nrandom sequences. Introducing correlations into the sequence statistics will alter this local composition, and\nmay therefore affect stretching behavior strongly. Here\nwe consider three simple, prototypical forms of correlated\nstatistics.\nWhen monomers of the same type are likely to be\nfound within a correlation \"length\" \u03be in the sequence,\nclusters of like monomers occur with high probability.\nThe weight of necklace structures is clearly enhanced for\nsuch blocky sequences, since regions of the chain with\nunfavorable solvation energy may be almost completely\nshielded from the solvent. Specifically, the distribution\nof local sequence compositions is nearly binary and independent of region size M for M < \u03be:\n1\np(q) \u2243 (\u03b4q,1 + \u03b4q,\u22121 ).\n2\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n(37)\n\nWe thank A. Yu. Grosberg and D. Klimov for fruitful\ndiscussions and critical readings of this manuscript. This\nwork was supported by NIH.\n\nAs a result, fluctuations in solvation energy of exposed\ncoil regions are of size \u0393\u03be. If \u03be \u223c N , the free energy stabilizing necklace structures is also macroscopic, Frand \u223c N .\nWith this macroscopic stabilization, the necklace phase\nwill be stable over a finite range of f even as N \u2192 \u221e.\nWhen correlations in monomer type decay algebraically, rather than exponentially, similarly dramatic\nfluctuations in local composition are possible. Specifically, power law correlations with decay exponent \u03b7\nyield h(\u03b4q)2 iq \u223c M \u2212\u03b7 . Because the sequence is onedimensional, fluctuations are enhanced only for \u03b7 \u2264 1 At\nthe crossover (\u03b7 = 1), h(\u03b4q)2 iq \u223c M \u22121 ln M , providing a\nweak stabilization of necklaces. But as \u03b7 \u2192 0, clusters\nof like monomers may be arbitrarily large. In this limit,\nnecklace stabilization again becomes macroscopic.\nAnticorrelations between like monomers, on the other\nhand, tends to destabilize necklace structures. In this\ncase, the local composition is essentially \"neutral\" (i.e.,\nq \u2248 0) for regions larger than the scale of anticorrelations, \u03be. For the statistics of neutrality fluctuations in\nCoulombic systems, h(\u03b4q)2 iq \u223c M \u22121/2 , fluctuations in\nthe effective random potential, \u2206u = O(1), are especially\nsmall. On scales larger than \u03be, the chain is effectively a\nhomopolymer. Consequently, necklace structures are not\nsufficiently stable to appear away from globule-coil coexistence.\nThese results suggest some basic principles for designing mechanically robust heteropolymers. Typical random sequences are poor candidates, since they tend to\nform partially unfolded necklace structures under strain.\nSequences in which solvophobic groups are heavily clustered together will typically also permit stable ensembles\nof necklace structures. Most promising are sequences\nwhose correlations suppress fluctuations in local composition. These may represent, for example, molecules\n\n[1] A. F. Oberhauser, P. E. Marszalek, H. P.
