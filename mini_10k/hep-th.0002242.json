Introduction\nIn the past few years there has been much interest in investigating the geometry\nof the moduli spaces of various supersymmetric black hole solutions of supergravity theories following some earlier work in [1, 2, 3]. Supersymmetric black hole\nsolutions are thought as the solitons of supergravity and so provide a macroscopic\ndescription of the solitons of strings and M-theory. As such one can investigate\ntheir moduli spaces in analogy with similar investigations of the moduli spaces of\nBPS monopoles in the context of Yang-Mills theory. However unlike the case of\nBPS monopoles, the geometry of the moduli space of various black holes is related\nto that of the target space of supersymmetric sigma models in one-dimension with\nnon-vanishing torsion [4]; for more recent work on the geometry of one-dimensional\nsigma models see [5]. This has been first established in [6] for a class of D=5 black\nholes that preserve 1/4 of the maximal supersymmetry and later extended for the\nelectric black holes of D=5 N=2 supergravity coupled to the graviphoton [7]. In\nthe former case, the geometry of black hole moduli space is strong HKT while in\nthe latter is weak HKT [8]. Later it was found that the moduli space of electrically\ncharged black holes of N=2 D=5 supergravity with any number of vector multiplets is again weak HKT [9]. More recently, the moduli space of (four-dimensional)\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes was investigated [10] and again it was confirmed\nthat its geometry is related to that of a class of one-dimensional sigma models\nwhich in addition to some bosonic multiplets also contain fermionic ones [4]. A\ncommon characteristic of all the above cases is that the geometry on the moduli\nspace of these black holes is determined by a scalar function, a 'moduli potential'.\nThe authors of [7, 10] also investigated the symmetries of the moduli spaces of the\nN=2 D=5 graviphoton and the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes for small black hole\nseparations and they found that they exhibit a D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry.\nIn this paper, we propose a moduli metric for a class of black holes in four and\nfive dimensions that preserve at least four supersymmetry charges of the underlying\nsupergravity theory. Typically, we consider black holes of maximal supergravities\n1\n\n\for black holes of N=2 supergravities in four and five dimensions. To be specific, if\nthe metric of supersymmetric black holes is given by\nds2 = \u2212A2 dt2 + B 2dxdx\n\n(1.1)\n\nthen the moduli potential \u03bc is\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\ndD\u22121x A\u22122 B 2 ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere D = 5 or D = 4. The integration is over the spatial directions of the black\nhole with respect to the Euclidean metric. It is assumed that the solution is perturbed within the appropriate supergravity theory and the only moduli parameters\nare the positions of the black holes. The above choice of the moduli potential is\nindependent from the choice of frame of the associated supergravity theory. One\nnovel property of our expression for the moduli potential is that it includes all the\nexamples of known black hole moduli potentials that have been computed so far.\nWe also explicitly compute the moduli metric of the electrically charged black hole\nsolutions of N=2 D=4 supergravity [11] in section eight and we find that it is again\ngiven by (1.2). In addition, we verify that the effective action associated with the\nmoduli potential (1.2) of a certain class of black holes exhibits the expected superconformal symmetries for small black hole separations. The metric and torsion on\nthe black hole moduli space associated with the moduli potential (1.2) are given\nin sections six and seven.\nWe first apply our formula to four- and five-dimensional black holes that can\nbe constructed by reducing intersecting brane configurations from ten and eleven\ndimensions. We show that the moduli potential is invariant under the T-and Sdualities of type II strings and the choice of frame of the supergravity theories.\nMoreover, (1.2) can be partially motivated by the universality of the ratio of the\nconformal factor of the transverse directions of the branes modulo that of the\nworldvolume directions. Since the moduli space of a class of electrically charged\n2\n\n\fblack holes has been explicitly computed, if one assumes that the moduli metric\nis S- and T-duality invariant, then one can establish (1.2). Another application of\nthe moduli potential (1.2) is in establishing the moduli metric of intersecting brane\nconfigurations as will be explained in section three.\nWe next apply our formula (1.2) to a class of four- and five-dimensional black\nholes associated with N=2 D=5 supergravity with any number of vector multiplets. The moduli potential of the electrically charged black holes of this theory\nhas been explicitly computed and agrees with (1.2). This includes the case of\nfive-dimensional black holes coupled to the graviphoton and investigated in [7].\nIn four dimensions our formula agrees with the moduli potential computed from\nthe moduli metric of (four-dimensional) Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes. Next we\napply (1.2) to give the moduli potential of the dyonic four-dimensional black holes\nthat arise from the reduction of the string solutions of N=2 D=5 supergravity\nsuperposed with a pp-wave and the electrically charged N=2 D=5 black holes in\nthe background of a KK-monopole. We also verify with an explicit computation\nthat the moduli potential of the four-dimensional electrically charged black holes\nof N=2 D=4 supergravity is again given by (1.2). We remark that the above mentioned dyonic black holes are dual to these electric ones. Finally, we investigate\nthe supersymmetric and superconformal properties of the effective actions of all\nthe above black holes. We find that for the class of such black holes which have\nregular horizons the effective action exhibits D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry\nat small black hole separations.\nThis paper has been organized as follows: In section two, we describe the\nmoduli potential of four- and five-dimensional black holes that arise from brane\nintersections in ten and eleven dimensions. In section three, we provide evidence in\nsupport of (1.2) using duality. In section four, we give the four-dimensional dyonic\nblack hole solutions which are reductions of the string solutions superposed with a\npp-wave and the electrically charged solutions superposed with a KK-monopole of\nN=2 D=5 supergravity. In section five, we apply our formula to give the moduli\npotential of all the above black holes and as an example we present the moduli po3\n\n\ftential of black holes associated with the STU model. In section six, we construct\nthe effective theory of five-dimensional black holes and examine its superconformal\nproperties. In section seven, we construct the effective theory of four-dimensional\nblack holes and examine its superconformal properties. In section eight, we compute the moduli metric of the electrically charged four-dimensional black holes of\nN=2 supergravity coupled to any number of vector multiplets and in section nine\nwe give our conclusions.\n\n2. Black Holes in four and five dimensions\n\u22c6\n\nA large class of four- and five-dimensional black holes can be constructed by\nappropriately reducing intersecting brane configurations of strings and M-theory\n[12]. This has been widely explored in the literature [12, 13, 14, 15]. These in\nparticular include the black holes that have been used to perform a microscopic\ncomputation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in [16, 17]. It has been observed\nin [14] that the metric of such black hole solutions can be expressed as\nds2 = \u2212\u03bbD\u22123 dt2 + \u03bb\u22121 ds2 (RD\u22121 )\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n1\n\n\u03bb = (\u03a0nI=1 HI )\u2212 D\u22122 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u03a0nI=1 HI = H1 . . . Hn .\n\n(2.3)\n\nand\n\nThe functions HI are harmonic in RD\u22121 , i.e.\nHI = h I +\n\nX\nA\n\n\u03bbIA\n.\n|x \u2212 yIA |D\u22123\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe constants {hI ; I = 1, . . . , n} can be related to the asymptotic values of the\n\u22c6 We use the term black holes to characterize all static solutions of supergravity which are\nasymptotically flat. In particular, we do not require for the solutions to have an event\nhorizon.\n4\n\n\fvarious scalars of the supergravity theory, {\u03bbIA ; A = 1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , n} are\n\nthe black hole charges and {yIA ; A = 1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , n} are the black hole\n\npositions. For five-dimensional black holes (D=5) n \u2264 3 and for four-dimensional\n\nblack holes (D=4) n \u2264 4. A subclass of such black holes are those for which the\npositions of the harmonic functions coincide, i.e.\nyIA = yJA\n\n(2.5)\n\nfor I 6= J. If in addition n = 3 for D = 5 or n = 4 for D = 4, then these black\nholes have regular horizons.\n\nThe black holes that are described by the metric (2.1) carry electric or magnetic\nor both electric and magnetic charges. The origin of these charges can be traced\nin their interpretation as intersecting branes in ten or eleven dimensions. In broad\nterms if the black hole is associated with M-2-branes and pp-waves, then it is\nelectrically charged but if it is associated with M-5-branes and KK-monopoles, then\nit is magnetically charged. There are also dyonic black holes that are associated\nwith both electric and magnetic branes. The Maxwell fields that the above black\nholes couple to are either KK-vectors due to the reduction or they are associated\nto the various brane field strengths in ten and eleven dimensions. In some cases,\nit is possible to take linear combinations of the Maxwell fields such that it can\nappear that a black hole couples to fewer Maxwell fields than it may be expected.\nThis mostly arises when we set the various harmonic functions that the black\nholes depend on to be equal. Since, we shall not use the explicit expression of the\nMaxwell fields of the solutions in what follows we shall neglect them.\nUsing the expression for the moduli potential proposed in the introduction, we\nfind that\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\ndD\u22121x \u03bb2\u2212D\n\n(2.6)\n\ndD\u22121x \u03a0nI=1 HI .\n\n(2.7)\n\nor equivalently\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\n5\n\n\fIn the five-dimensional case (D=5), for n = 1 the moduli space is flat, for n = 2\nthe moduli space is strong HKT and for n = 3 the moduli space is weak HKT.\nSuch solutions preserve 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of supersymmetry, respectively. Moreover\nthey are associated with configurations in strings and M-theory that involve one\nbrane, two branes and three branes, respectively. The general case is that with\nthree harmonic functions since all the others can be derived from it by setting one\nor more of the harmonic functions to be constant. Another simplification of the\nn = 3 case is to set all the harmonic functions to be equal, i.e.\nH = H1 = H2 = H3 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn that case, the moduli potential becomes\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\nd4 x H 3 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThis moduli potential is the same as that of the black holes of N=2 supergravity\ncoupled to the graviphoton and derived in [7]. In fact, the graviphoton black hole\ncan be constructed by reducing the M-brane configuration of three intersecting\nM-2-branes on a 0-brane with all three harmonic functions associated with each\nM-2-brane set to be equal [12]. In this case, the moduli potential (2.9) has been\nverified by an explicit calculation. For the rest of the cases, we shall provide an\nargument in the next section.\nThe superconformal properties of the moduli space (2.9) for small black hole\nseparation are the same as those of graviphoton black holes investigated in [7].\nA more general case arises whenever we choose the positions of the harmonic\nfunctions to be the same but the asymptotic values of the scalars and the charges\nto be different, i.e.\nHI = h I +\n\nX\nA\n\n\u03bbIA\n.\n|x \u2212 yA |D\u22123\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe superconformal properties of these black holes will be investigated in section\nsix.\n6\n\n\fIn the four-dimensional case (D=4), for n = 1 the moduli space is flat and for\nn = 4 the geometry on the moduli space generalizes that on the moduli space of\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes. The rest of the cases are new. For n = 1\nthe solutions preserve 1/2, for n = 2 the solutions preserve 1/4, for n = 3 and\nn = 4 the solutions preserve 1/8 of the maximal supersymmetry, respectively. As\nin the five-dimensional case, the most general case arises whenever n = 4 since\nall the other cases can be derived by setting one or more harmonic functions to\nbe constant. Another simplification of the n = 4 case is to set all the harmonic\nfunctions to be equal, i.e.\nH = H1 = H2 = H3 = H4 .\n\n(2.11)\n\nIn that case, the moduli potential becomes\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\nd3 x H 4 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe geometry on the moduli space then is that of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack holes [10]. So the superconformal properties of the effective theory for small\nblack hole separation are the same as those of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes.\nA more general case arises whenever we choose the positions of the harmonic\nfunctions to be the same but the asymptotic values of the scalars and the charges\nto be different as in (2.10). The superconformal properties of these black holes will\nbe investigated in section seven.\n\n7\n\n\f3. Moduli Spaces from Intersecting Branes\nIt is well known that all of the supersymmetric black holes in four- and fivedimensions can be constructed by reducing intersecting M-brane configurations\npossibly superposed with a pp-wave or a KK-monopole. The two latter configurations reduce to a D-0-brane and a D-6-brane upon compactification to ten\ndimensions on S 1 , respectively [18]. So one may expect to understand the expression of the moduli potential by investigating the brane solutions in eleven and\nten dimensions. We shall argue that indeed some of the features of the proposed\nmoduli potential of the four- and five-dimensional black holes have their origin in\nthe form of the brane solutions in ten and eleven dimensions. But there are also\nsome puzzles.\nThe first observation toward this concerns the ratio of the components of the\nmetric of all brane solutions in ten and eleven dimensions. To be specific recall\nthat the spacetime metrics of the various branes are as follows: The metric of the\nM-2-brane [19] and the M-5-brane [20] are\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nds2 = H 3 H \u22121 ds2 (E(1,2) ) + ds2 (E8 )\n\u0003\n2\u0002\nds2 = H 3 H \u22121 ds2 (E(1,5) ) + ds2 (E5 ) ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nrespectively, the metrics of the D-p-branes [21, 22] are\n1\n\n1\n\nds2 = H \u2212 2 ds2 (E(1,p) ) + H 2 ds2 (E9\u2212p )\n\n(3.2)\n\nthe metric of the fundamental string [23] is\nds2 = H \u22121 ds2 (E(1,1) ) + ds2 (E8 )\n\n(3.3)\n\nand the metric of the NS-5-brane [24] is\nds2 = ds2 (E(1,5) ) + Hds2 (E4 ) ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere H is a harmonic function of the transverse directions in each case. A common\ncharacteristic of all these solutions is that the ratio B 2A\u22122 of the conformal factor\n8\n\n\fof the transverse directions modulo that of the worldvolume directions is equal to\nH,\nB 2A\u22122 = H .\n\n(3.5)\n\nIn particular this implies that this ratio is invariant under the various T- and\nS-dualities that relate the M-theory and type II string theories. It also follows\nfrom the above observation and the harmonic function rule [25] that for all the\nintersecting brane configurations the ratio of the conformal factor of the overall\ntransverse directions modulo that of the common intersection is universal and\ndepends only on the number n of the branes involved in the intersection. In\nparticular, we find that\nB 2 A\u22122 = H1 H2 * * * Hn .\n\n(3.6)\n\nIncidentally, this ratio is the same as that of the spatial modulo the timelike components of the metric of the associated black holes.\nOne expects that the moduli space of four- and five-dimensional black holes,\nthat arise from appropriately reducing the above brane solutions is flat. This is\nbecause the associated black holes preserve 1/2 of the maximal supersymmetry\nand so the effective action has sixteen supersymmetries. Such a high number of\n\u22c6\n\nsupersymmetries render the sigma model target space flat . In such case, one can\nchoose for the black hole moduli potential\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\ndD xH .\n\n(3.7)\n\nNow if two or more branes are involved in the configuration, it is natural to take the\nmoduli potential to depend on the product of harmonic functions. This is because\n\u2020\n\nall harmonic functions enter in a symmetric way in the black hole metric and that\n\u22c6 It also follows from the reduction of the effective theories of branes to lower dimensions neglecting possible non-abelian interactions and collecting the terms quadratic in the velocities.\n\u2020 There are completely symmetric brane intersections that give rise to four- and five-dimensional\nblack holes. For these the metric, the scalars and the Maxwell fields are all symmetric.\n9\n\n\fif one of them is set to one, say Hk = 1, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, the expression for the moduli\n\npotential should remain symmetric in the rest of the harmonic functions. Of course\nthere are many other symmetric polynomials of the harmonic functions which can\nbe added in the expression for the potential. But all of them have degree lower\nthan that of the product. After setting one or more harmonic functions to one, we\nget a moduli metric which would be scaled by a conformal factor. In particular,\nwe shall find a scaled version of the potential (3.7) that is not expected.\nAnother argument in support of (1.2) can be established using duality. As\nwe have mentioned the expression for the moduli potential is T- and S- dualities\ninvariant. Now if we assume that black holes that are related by T- and S-dualities\nshould have the same moduli space, then the moduli potential (1.2) can be derived in the five-dimensional case. This is because the moduli potential for the\ngraviphoton black hole agrees with (1.2) and that this black hole is a reduction\nfrom the M-theory configuration of three M-2-branes intersecting on a 0-brane.\nThe M-2-brane configuration is then related to the rest of intersecting branes of\nstrings and M-theory via T- and S-dualities which give the rest of five-dimensional\nblack holes.\nIt is worth mentioning that our expression for the moduli potential (1.2) can\napply to intersecting brane configurations. In this case, the effective theory may not\nbe one-dimensional. Typically, the dimension of the effective theory is that of the\ncommon intersection. Moreover the effective theory may contain apart from scalars\nother fields like vectors and tensors. However, we argue that the part of the effective\ntheory which describes the dynamics of the scalars that are associated with the\noverall position of the configuration in spacetime when reduced to one-dimension\ncoincides with the effective theory of the black hole that can be constructed from\nthe configuration. To give an example, let us consider the moduli of the solution\nof eleven-dimensional supergravity with metric\n1\n1\u0002\n1\nds2 = H13 H23 H33 \u2212 H1\u22121 H2\u22121 H3\u22121ds2 (E)\n\n\u0003\n+ H1\u22121 ds2 (E2 ) + H2\u22121ds2 (E2 ) + H3\u22121 ds2 (E2 ) + ds2 (E3 )\n10\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fwhich has the interpretation of three M-2-branes intersecting on a 0-brane, where\nH1 , H2 , H3 are harmonic functions on E3 . The effective theory of the transverse\nscalars this configuration is determined by the moduli potential\n\u03bc=\n\nZ\n\nd 3 x H1 H2 H3\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich is the ratio of the component of the metric along E3 (overall transverse) to\nthe component of the metric along E (common intersection). The above moduli\npotential is of course the moduli potential of the four-dimensional black hole associated with the above configuration. A similar analysis can be done for other such\nconfigurations.\nDespite these there are some puzzles. One involves the M-theory configuration\nof three M-5-branes pairwise intersecting on a 3-brane and all together at a string\n[12]. Reducing this solution to five dimensions, we find a string solution which is\nin the same universality class as the string solutions of the N=2 D=5 supergravity.\nOne might expect that the effective theory of such strings using the supersymmetry projectors of the M-branes to be a (4,0)-supersymmetric two-dimensional\nsigma model with strong HKT geometry. This would imply that the moduli space\nhas dimension 4N and that the torsion is a closed three form. Since there are three\ntransverse scalars for each black hole, the moduli space has in fact dimension 3N\nand the torsion is not a closed form. The former point can be explained by arguing that there are additional moduli for these black holes. Indeed in string theory\napart from the transverse scalars, intersecting brane configurations have additional\nscalar, vector and or even tensor moduli. The additional scalars may be due to\ne.g. D-brane type of counting; for an example see [26]. All these can be reduced\nto five dimensions giving a bigger moduli space from the one we are investigating.\nThe latter point may also be resolved by observing that the intersection is chiral.\nIn such a case the torsion can be modified by adding a Chern-Simons type of term\nto cancel the anomaly which renders the modified torsion to be a non-closed form.\nHowever, we have not been able to establish the details of the above arguments.\n11\n\n\fOne encounters similar puzzles with even purely electric solutions as it has already\nbeen mentioned in [6]. As another one consider the seven-dimensional black hole\nwhich can be found by reducing the intersection of two M-2-branes on a 0-brane\nconfiguration of M-theory. One can easily see that in this case there is missing\nmoduli. However upon reducing the solution further to five-dimensions, the moduli space becomes strong HKT as expected. This appears to be a rather common\nphenomenon. Upon reducing the solutions to an appropriate dimension, the geometry of the associated black hole moduli space can be understood in terms of\nthat of the target space of a supersymmetric sigma model.\n\n4. Very special Four-Dimensional Black Holes\nA large class of black holes in four dimensions can be constructed by reducing\neither the string solution of the N=2 supergravity superposed with a pp-wave or the\nvery special electrically charged black holes of the N=2 D=5 supergravity in a KKmonopole background. To describe these solutions, we first review some aspects\nof N=2 D=5 supergravity. The bosonic part of the action of five-dimensional\nN = 2 supergravity with k vector multiplets is associated to a hypersurface N of\nRk defined by the equation\n1\nV (X) \u2261 CIJK X I X J X K = 1\n6\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere {X I ; I = 1, . . . , k} are standard coordinates on Rk and CIJK are constants.\n\nIn the case of a model arising from a Calabi-Yau compactification of M-theory, the\n\nconstants CIJK are the topological intersection numbers of the compact manifold.\nNext we set\n1 \u2202\n9\n1\n\u2202\nlog V |V =1 = XI XJ \u2212 CIJK X K\nI\nJ\n2 \u2202X \u2202X\n2\n2\n\u2202X I \u2202X J\n= QIJ\n|V =1 ,\n\u2202\u03c6a \u2202\u03c6b\n\nQIJ \u2261 \u2212\nhab\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere {\u03c6a ; i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} are local coordinates of N, h is interpreted as a metric\n12\n\n\fon N and\n1\nXI = CIJK X J X K\n6\n\n(4.3)\n\nare the dual coordinates to X I . Note that the hypersurface equation V = 1 can also\nbe rewritten as X I XI = 1. Then, the bosonic part of the associated supergravity\naction [27, 28] with vector potentials AI and scalars \u03c6a is\nS=\n\n\u0003\n\u221a \u0002\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nd5 x \u2212g R + QIJ F I \u03bc\u03bd F J + hab\u2202\u03bc \u03c6a \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6b\n2\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4\nCIJK F I \u03bc\u03bd F J \u03c1\u03c3 AK \u03c4 ,\n\u2212 e\n24\n\nZ\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere F I = dAI , I, J, K = 1, . . . , k are the 2-form Maxwell field strengths,\n\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c1, \u03c3 = 0, . . . , 4, and g is the metric of the five-dimensional spacetime; we have\nused the same symbol \u03c6a to denote both the coordinates of N and the various\nscalar fields of the theory.\nThe field equations of the above Lagrangian obtained from varying the scalars\n\u03c6a ,\n\nthe spacetime metric g, and the vector potentials AI are\n\u221a\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u00021 I\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u03bd\nF \u03bc\u03bd F J + \u2202\u03bc X I \u2202 \u03bc X J \u2212 2\u2202\u03bc \u2212gQIJ \u2202 \u03bc X I \u2202a X K = 0 ,\n2\n(4.5)\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u03c1\n\u2212g G\u03bc\u03bd + QIJ F I \u03bc\u03c1 F J \u03bd + QIJ \u2202\u03bc X I \u2202\u03bd X J\n(4.6)\n\u00021\n\u0003\n1\u221a\n\u03c1\u03c3\n\u2212gg\u03bc\u03bd QIJ F I \u03c1\u03c3 F J + QIJ \u2202\u03c1 X I \u2202 \u03c1 X J = 0 ,\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\n\u2212g\u2202a QIJ\n\nand\n\u22122\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u0002\u221a\n\n\u2212gQIJ F J\n\n\u03bc\u03bd \u0003\n\n1\n\u2212 e\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03bc\u03c4 CIJK F J \u03c1\u03c3 F K \u03bc\u03c4 = 0 ,\n8\n\n(4.7)\n\nrespectively. The electrically charged black holes have been found in [29]. The\nelectrically charged black hole solutions in the background of a KK-monopole are\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = \u2212e\u22124U dt2 + e2U H0\u22121(d\u03c4 + \u03c9)2 + H0 dx2\n\nAI 0 = e\u22122U X I\n1\ne2U XI = HI ,\n3\n\n13\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhere\nHI = h I +\nH0 = h 0 +\n\nNI\nX\n\nA=1\nN0\nX\n\nA=1\n\n\u03bbIA\n|x \u2212 yIA |\n\n(4.9)\n\n\u03bb0A\n|x \u2212 y0A |\n\nare harmonic function on R3 . The positions of the black holes are labeled by the\ncoordinates {(y0A , yIA ); A = 1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , k}. The constants {(h0 , hI ); I =\n\n1, . . . , k} are the values of the scalar fields at spatial infinity and {(\u03bb0A , \u03bbIA ); A =\n\n1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , k} are the charges of the black holes. Viewing eU as an\n\nadditional scalar, the last equation in (4.8) gives the k independent scalars {eU , \u03c6a }\n\nin terms of the k harmonic functions {HI }. A reduction of this solution to four\ndimensions along the compact direction \u03c4 leads to four-dimensional black holes\n\nwith metric (in the Einstein frame)\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nds2 = \u2212e\u22123U H0 2 dt2 + e3U H02 dx2 .\n\n(4.10)\n\nThese black holes, apart from the electric charges associated with those in five\ndimensions, also have a magnetic charge with respect to the KK-vector of the\nreduction.\nThe other class of four-dimensional black holes can be obtained by using the\nstring solution of N=2 D=5 supergravity of [30]. Superposing this solutions with\na pp-wave, we have\n\n\u0001\nds2 = e\u2212U dudv + H 0 du2 + e2U dx2\n\nI\nFmn\n= \u2212\u01ebmnp \u2202p H I\n\neU X I = H I ,\n14\n\n(4.11)\n\n\fwhere u, v are light-cone coordinates and\nH I = hI +\nH 0 = h0 +\n\nNI\nX\n\nA=1\nN0\nX\n\nA=1\n\n\u03bbIA\n|x \u2212 yIA |\n\u03bb0A\n.\n|x \u2212 y0A |\n\n(4.12)\n\nThe positions of the black holes are labeled by the coordinates {(y0A , yIA ); A =\n\n1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , k} as in the previous case. The constants {(h0 , hI ); I =\n1, . . . , k} are the values of the scalar fields at spatial infinity and {(\u03bb0 A , \u03bbI A ); A =\n\n1, . . . , NI ; I = 1, . . . , k} are the charges of the black holes. Reducing this solution\n\nto four-dimensions along the direction of the wave leads to a four-dimensional black\nhole with metric in the Einstein frame (see also [11])\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\nds2 = \u2212H0 2 e\u2212 2 U dt2 + H02 e 2 U dx2 .\n\n(4.13)\n\nThese black holes carry magnetic charges which correspond to the charges of the\nfive-dimensional string. They also carry an electric charge which is related to the\nmomentum of the pp-wave.\nMany other dyonic black hole solutions of four-dimensional supergravity theories are known. Some of them have been found by investigating the solutions of\nsupergravity theories associated with the heterotic string [31]. The relation of these\nblack holes to brane configurations of the heterotic string have also been explored\n[32].\nTo express the black hole solutions explicitly in terms of the harmonic functions,\none has to solve the stabilization equations (see [33]). From here on, we shall\nassume that solutions to these equations exist for the models we are considering.\nWe also remark that a special subclass of solutions are those for which the positions\nof the harmonic functions are the same y0A = yIA = yJA for I 6= J. These black\nholes are of interest because they exhibit regular horizons. It is straightforward to\nsee this by extending the arguments of [34, 30] which have followed earlier work in\n[35, 36, 37]. In both cases the near horizon geometry is AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 .\n15\n\n\f5. The Moduli Potential of N=2 Black Holes\nThe universal formula (1.2) for the moduli potential is in agreement with the\nexplicitly computed moduli potential of the electrically charged black holes of N=2\nD=5 supergravity with any number of vector multiplets [9]. Moreover, (1.2) is\nalso in agreement with the explicitly computed moduli potential of the ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole in [10].\nApplying (1.2), we find that the moduli potential for the black holes (4.10) is\n\n\u03bc1 =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x H0e6U ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nZ\n\nd3 x H 0 e3U .\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhile for the black holes (4.13) is\n\u03bc2 =\n\nIf we again assume that the moduli metric is invariant under duality, then in both\ncases the moduli potentials can be derived from that which we compute in section\neight. This is because we have mentioned that the above dyonic black holes are\ndual to the electrically charged ones of N=2 D=4 supergravity.\nTo give some examples, we have to consider models for which the stabilization\nequations have an explicit solution. Such a model is the so called STU model [38];\nfor other models see [39, 40]. For this, the only non vanishing component of CIJK\nis C123 . For the back holes (4.10), one can find that\ne6U = H1 H2 H3 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nTherefore, the moduli potential of the associated four-dimensional black holes is\n\u03bc1 =\n\nZ\n\nd 3 x H0 H1 H2 H3 .\n16\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fSimilarly for the (4.13) black holes, we find that\ne3U = H 1 H 2 H 3 .\n\n(5.5)\n\nand consequently, the moduli potential is\n\u03bc2 =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x H 0 H 1 H 2 H 3 .\n\n(5.6)\n\nIt is apparent that the moduli potential in both the above cases is the same. So\nthe geometry on the moduli space of (4.10) black holes is the same as that on the\nmoduli space of (4.13) black holes. Moreover, it coincides with the moduli potential\nof four-dimensional black holes which preserve 1/8 of the maximal supersymmetry\nwhich are associated with intersecting branes and have four harmonic functions\nin sections two and three. As for the intersecting branes black holes, we can set\nH = H 0 = H 1 = H 2 = H 3 or H = H0 = H1 = H2 = H3 . Then the moduli\npotentials \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 reduce to that of Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole computed\nin [10]. A more general case is to take the positions of the harmonic functions of\n(4.10) black holes to be the same but allow the charges \u03bbIA and the asymptotic\nvalues of the scalars to be different, i.e yA = y0A = yIA for I = 1, . . . , k but\nh0 6= hI 6= hJ and \u03bb0A 6= \u03bbIA 6= \u03bbJA for I 6= J , and similarly for the (4.13) black\n\nholes. As we shall see, this class of black holes exhibit the same superconformal\nproperties for small black hole separation as those of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole.\n\n17\n\n\f6. The effective theory of five-dimensional black holes\n6.1. Supersymmetry\nIt is straightforward given the moduli potential \u03bc, (1.2), of the five-dimensional\nblack holes to determine the metric and the torsion on the moduli space. This\nanalysis is the same for all five-dimensional black holes, i.e. those that have the\ninterpretation as intersecting branes in ten or eleven dimensions that preserve 1/8\nof the supersymmetry and the black holes of N=2 D=5 supergravity that preserve\n1/2 of the supersymmetry. So in what follows we shall not distinguish between\nthese two cases. The moduli space is a weak HKT manifold [8] with HKT potential\n\u03bc. So using [41, 42], the metric and torsion are\n3\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\nds2 = \u2202mIA \u2202nJB +\n(Is )l m (Is )q n \u2202lIA \u2202qJB \u03bc dy mIA dy nJB\ns=1\n\n(6.1)\n\nc = 6\u2202pIA \u2202qJB \u2202sKC \u03bc (I1 )p m (I2 )q n (I3 )s l dy mIA \u2227 dy nJB \u2227 dy lKC\nrespectively, where {y mIA ; m = 1, . . . , D \u2212 1; I = 1, . . . , k; A = 1, . . . , N} label the\n\npositions of the kN black-holes. The endomorphisms {Ir ; r = 1, 2, 3} are associated\n\nwith a constant hypercomplex structure on R4 . These induce a hypercomplex\nstructure on the moduli space by setting\n(Ir )mIA nJB = (Ir )m n \u03b4 I J \u03b4 A B\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhich is required for the HKT structure. One can easily show that the black hole\nmoduli space equipped with metric and torsion (6.1) and hypercomplex structure\n\u22c6\n\n(6.2) admits an weak HKT structure .\nThe effective theory has N=4B one-dimensional supersymmetry. Both the\nsupersymmetry multiplet and the effective action can be constructed using the\ngeneral results on supersymmetric sigma models of [4, 6] adapted to this case. In\n\u22c6 For other applications of HKT manifolds see [45, 41].\n18\n\n\fparticular, we promote the coordinates on the moduli space to N = 4B superfields\ny mIA = y mIA (t, \u03b80 , . . . , \u03b83 ) and impose the constraint\nDr y mIA = (Ir )mIA nJB D0 y nIA = (Ir )m n D0 y nIA\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere {D0 , Dr ; r = 1, 2, 3} are the supersymmetry derivatives, i.e.\nD02 = Dr2 = i\u2202t\n(6.4)\n\nD0 Dr + Dr D0 = 0\nDr Ds + Ds Dr = 0,\n\nr 6= s .\n\nThe associated N = 4B supersymmetric action is\n1\nS=\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0002\ndtd\u03b80 igmIA,nJB D0 y mIA \u2202t y nJB\n\n\u0003\n1\n+ cmIA,nJB,lKC D0 y mIA D0 y nJB D0 y lKC .\n3!\n\n(6.5)\n\nThis action describes the effective theory of five-dimensional supersymmetric black\nholes which preserve four supercharges.\nIn the special case where the positions of the harmonic functions are the same,\nyA = yIA , the moduli space is again a weak HKT manifold with HKT potential\n\u03bc.

(6.9)\n3!\n\nThis completes the description of the supersymmetric effective theory actions of\nfive-dimensional black holes.\nFor black holes that preserve more than four supercharges, the moduli metric is\nagain determined by the moduli potential (1.2). However, the effective theory may\ncontain additional fermionic multiplets. For example, for some black holes that\npreserve eight supercharges the moduli space admits two commuting strong HKT\nstructures. The effective action then contains additional fermions to construct the\nassociated multiplets. These multiplets have been described in [4, 6]. Finally, we\nremark that the effective actions in both the above cases can also be written as a\nfull superspace integral as\n1\nS=\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\ndt d4 \u03b8 \u03bc .\n\n(6.10)\n\n6.2. Superconformal Symmetry\nIn [10], it was shown that for small black hole separations the effective theory\nof the graviphoton electrically charged black holes of N=2 D=5 supergravity exhibits D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry. This is related to the observation that\nthe near horizon geometry of these black holes is AdS2 \u00d7 S 3 . However, the near\nhorizon geometry of five-dimensional black holes that preserve 1/8 of the maximal\n\nsupersymmetry and are associated with intersecting branes, and that of the black\nholes of the N=2 D=5 supergravity theory is also AdS2 \u00d7 S 3 . Since this should be\n\nthe case for every black hole involved in the superposition, the relevant solutions\n20\n\n\f\u22c6\n\nare those for which all the harmonic functions have the same positions . So one expects that the effective theory (6.9) of these black holes will also exhibit D(2, 1; 0)\nsuperconformal symmetry for small black hole separations.\nThe conditions for a N = 4B supersymmetric sigma model to exhibit superconformal symmetry have been investigated in [42] and we shall not repeat them here\n\u2020\n\nin detail . We shall simply verify the conditions that the sigma model manifold\nadmits a homothetic motion generated by a vector field D and that the associated\none-form to D is closed. We shall then comment about the rest of the conditions.\nThe limit of small black hole separation is achieved by requiring that the asymptotic constants of the harmonic functions that determine the solutions vanish, i.e.\nhI \u2192 0. Then following [7], we write the moduli potential as\n\u03bc = \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bc3\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere\nX \u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3A\n\n(6.12)\n\nX \u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3B + \u03bb3A \u03bb2A \u03bb1B + \u03bb1A \u03bb3A \u03bb2B\n|x \u2212 yA |4 |x \u2212 yB |2\n\n(6.13)\n\n\u03bc1 =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\n\u03bc3 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\nA\n\n|x \u2212 yA |6\n\nA6=B\n\nd4 x\n\nX\n\nA6=B6=C\n\n\u03bb1A \u03bb2B \u03bb3C\n.\n|x \u2212 yA |2 |x \u2212 yA |2 |x \u2212 yA |2\n\n(6.14)\n\nThere is no contribution to the moduli metric from \u03bc1 because it is independent\nfrom yA as it can be easily seen by a change of variables in the integral. The\ncontribution to the moduli metric due to \u03bc2 has a logarithmic divergence\n\nln\u03b4\n|yA \u2212yB |2\n\nfor x \u2192 yA , where \u03b4 is a cut off, (|x \u2212 yA | \u2265 \u03b4. However, these terms do not\n\ncontribute to the moduli metric; they are eliminated passing from the potential to\n\u22c6 We also consider in our investigation only STU black holes.\n\u2020 Superconformal sigma models with scalar potential have been considered in [43].\n21\n\n\fthe moduli metric because of the differentiation.

To show this, we first observe that the part of the metric\n\u2021 In the case for which all the positions of the harmonic functions are different, \u03bc3 is the only\ncontributing term. But as we shall see later, in this case the moduli metric is degenerate.\n22\n\n\fassociated with \u03bc3 is degenerate along D. Using this, we find that\nDmA dy mA = \u2212gmA,nB y nB dy mA\n\u0002 X \u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3B + \u03bb3A \u03bb2A \u03bb1B + \u03bb1A \u03bb3A \u03bb2B \u0003\n,\n= 2\u03c0 2 d\n|yA \u2212 yB |2\n\n(6.21)\n\nA6=B\n\nand so DmA dy mA is closed as required. It turns out that the rest of the conditions\nfor superconformal invariance also hold. Therefore the moduli geometry for small\nblack hole separation exhibits a D(2, 1; 0) superconformal invariance.\n\n7. The effective theory of four-dimensional black holes\n7.1. Supersymmetry\nThe effective theory of four-dimensional black holes which preserve 1/8 of the\nmaximal supersymmetry is expected to have four supercharges. The dimension\nof the moduli space is 3nN, where n is the number of harmonic functions of the\nsolution and N is the number of positions of each harmonic function. The description of the effective theory is the same for all four-dimensional black holes,\ni.e. those that have the interpretation as intersecting branes in ten or in eleven\ndimensions, the black holes that are reductions of the solutions superposed with\na pp-wave or a KK-monopole of N=2 D=5 supergravity and preserve 1/2 of the\nsupersymmetry and the electrically charged black holes of N=2 D=4 supergravity.\nTo keep the notation uniform, we label the positions of the former black holes\nas {yIA ; I = 1, . . . , n; A = 1, . . . , N} and the positions of the latter black holes as\n\n{yIA ; I = 0, 1, . . . , k; A = 1, . . . , N} with n = k +1. The range of I can be different\nin the two cases but this would not affect our formulae below.\n\nNext we derive the supersymmetry multiplet and the effective action of the\nabove black holes by appropriately adapting the general results of [4] on supersymmetric one-dimensional sigma models and by comparing with the effective action\nof Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes in [10]. In particular, we promote the positions\n23\n\n\fof the black holes to superfields as yIA = yIA (t, \u03b80 , . . . , \u03b83 ) and add a new supersymmetry fermionic multiplet \u03c8 IA (t, \u03b80 , . . . , \u03b83 ). In addition, we impose the\nconstraints\nDr y mIA = \u01ebr m n D0 y nIA + \u03b4 m r \u03c8 IA\nDr \u03c8 IA = i\u03b4rn \u2202t y nIA .\n\n(7.1)\n\nWe remark that all the four-dimensional black holes associated with intersecting\nbranes with four harmonic functions and those that are reductions of N=2 D=5\nsupergravity are charged with respect one KK-vector. Therefore the argument in\n[10] applies for the presence of the fermionic multiplets, i.e. that they are due\nto zero modes along the KK-direction.

However, in the description of the effective\ntheory one may have to add additional one-dimensional fields to describe the supersymmetry multiplets. These are required by supersymmetry as in the fivedimensional case.\n7.2. Superconformal Symmetry\nThe investigation of superconformal symmetry of the moduli space of fourdimensional black holes for small black hole separation is similar to that presented\nfor the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in [10]. In particular, the effective theory\nadmits a D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry in the near horizon limit. As in\nthe four-dimensional case, the relevant class of black holes are those that exhibit\nregular near horizon geometry. These are the black holes that have four harmonic\n26\n\n\f\u22c6\n\nfunctions with the same centres for which the near horizon geometry at every\ncentre is AdS2 \u00d7 S 2 .\nThe conditions for a sigma model action such as (7.9) to exhibit superconformal symmetry have been given in [10] and we shall not repeat them here. In\nwhat follows, we shall show that our moduli metric admits a homothetic motion\ngenerated by a vector field D and that the associated one-form of D is closed. To\nbegin, we write\ngmA,nB = Gkl\nmn \u2202kA \u2202lB \u03bc ,\n\n(7.12)\n\nk l\nrk\nl\nGkl\nmn = \u03b4m \u03b4n + \u01eb m \u01ebr n .\n\n(7.13)\n\nwhere\n\nSince we expect a close relationship between the superconformal properties of the\nfive-dimensional black holes and those of the four-dimensional ones, we take the\nvector field D which generates the homothetic motion to be the following:\nDmA \u2202mA =\n\n2 mA\ny \u2202mA ,\nh\n\n(7.14)\n\nwhere h is a constant which will be determined. Using our ansatz for D and the\nexpression (7.12), we find that D is a homothety if\n(y mA \u2202mA \u2212 h)\u03bc =\n\nh\nK ,\n2\n\n(7.15)\n\nwhere K is in the kernel of the operator\nGABmn = Gkl\nmn \u2202kA \u2202lB\n\n(7.16)\n\nwhich is used to find the metric on the moduli space from the moduli potential.\n\u22c6 We also consider only the black holes and string solutions of the N=2 D=5 supergravity\nassociated with the STU model.\n27\n\n\fAs in the case of five-dimensional black holes above, we write the moduli potential as\n\u03bc = \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bc\u2032 ,\n\n(7.17)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc1 =\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\nX \u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3A \u03bb4A\n|x \u2212 yA |4\n\nA\n\n,\n\nX \u0002 \u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3A \u03bb4B\n\u0003\n+ cyclic in(1, 2, 3, 4) ,\n3\n|x \u2212 yA | |x \u2212 yB |\n\n(7.18)\n\n(7.19)\n\nA6=B\n\nand \u03bc\u2032 contains the rest of the terms. Both \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 contain divergent terms which\nhowever do not contribute to the moduli metric. In particular, \u03bc1 is independent\nform the positions of the black holes and so it does not contribute. Putting a cut\noff |x \u2212 yA | \u2265 \u03b4, we can evaluate \u03bc2 to find\n\u03bc2 = 4\u03c0\n\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nln|yA \u2212 yB | + (1 \u2212 ln\u03b4)\n+ cyclic in(1, 2, 3, 4) .\n\u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3A \u03bb4B\n|yA \u2212 yB |\n\nA6=B\n\n(7.20)\n\nNext using\nGCDmn\n\n1\n=0,\n|yA \u2212 yB |\n\n(7.21)\n\nwe see that the divergent part does not contribute. So ignoring the divergent part,\nwe see that\n1\n(y mA \u2202mA + 1)\u03bc2 = \u2212 K ,\n2\n\n(7.22)\n\n\u0003\n1\n\u03c0 X\u0002\n\u03bb1A \u03bb2A \u03bb3A \u03bb4B\n+ cyclic in(1, 2, 3, 4) .\n4\n|yA \u2212 yB |\n\n(7.23)\n\nwhere\nK=\n\nA6=B\n\nwhich is in the kernel of GCDmn . Next, we can observe that \u03bc\u2032 is homogeneous of\n28\n\n\fdegree \u22121 and so\n(y mA \u2202mA + 1)\u03bc\u2032 = 0 .\n\n(7.24)\n\nFrom all these, we find that (7.15) holds for h = \u22121 and\nD = \u22122y mA \u2202mA\n\n(7.25)\n\nis a homothetic vector field. To generate special conformal transformations, the\nassociated form of D should be closed as in the case of five-dimensional black holes.\nIn particular, one can show that\nDmA = \u22122gmA,nB y nB = \u2202mA K .\n\n(7.26)\n\nFor this, we have used the rotational invariance of \u03bc under SO(3), i.e.\ny mA \u01ebnl m \u2202lB \u03bc = 0 .\n\n(7.27)\n\nThe above properties of the moduli metric indicate that at small black hole separation the effective theory admits an SL(2, R) symmetry. It turns out that the\nrest of the conditions for superconformal invariance of [10] can also be verified. So\nthe effective action admits a D(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry.\n\n8. Black Holes and Special K\u00e4hler Geometry\n8.1. The Black Hole Solutions\nThe action of N = 2 four-dimensional supergravity with n + 1 vectors F I =\ndAI and n complex scalars z a has been found in [44].

Perturbations\nIn order to determine the low energy behaviour of these solutions we allow the\ncentres yIA to depend on t.

The moduli\nspace metric is generated by a potential function in agreement with the conjecture\n(1.2).\n37\n\n\f9. Concluding Remarks\nWe have proposed that the moduli metric of a large class of four- and fivedimensional black holes can be determined by a moduli potential. In turn this\ncan be determined by the components of the metric of the black hole solution\nas in (1.2). Then we have provided evidence that such choice gives consistent\nresults. In particular, it describes all the black hole moduli metrics that have been\ncomputed explicitly. In some cases, one can argue under certain assumptions that\nthe expression for the moduli potential (1.2) can be shown using duality. Moreover,\nthe associated effective theories of black holes which are constructed using (1.2)\nexhibit the expected superconformal behaviour at small black hole separations.\nOne can extend our construction to find a U-duality invariant expression for\nthe moduli potential. However, for this to be consistent one should use U-duality\ninvariant black hole solutions [46]; for recent work see for example [47]. In four di\u22c6\n\nmensions, such black holes carry the charges of all branes . It would be interesting\nto see whether our moduli potential formula still applies in this case.\nIt is clear from our results that the effective theories of black holes that have\nregular horizons exhibit superconformal symmetry at small black holes separations.\nThis can prove useful in understanding multi-black hole quantum mechanics using\nthe suggestion of [50] adapted for black holes [51, 52] and black hole moduli spaces\n[7, 42, 10].\nAcknowledgments: We thank A.
