The model\nfollows the chemical, thermal and dynamical response of the disc to an external spiral\npotential. Self-gravity and magnetic fields are not included.

Self-shielding provides a sharp transition density, below which\ngas is essentially atomic, and above which the molecular gas fraction is > 0.001. The\ntimescale for gas to move between these regimes is very rapid (61 Myr). From this\nstage, the majority of gas generally takes between 10 to 20 Myr to obtain high H2\nfractions (> 50 percent). These are however strict upper limits to the H2 formation\ntimescale, since our calculations are unable to resolve turbulent motions on scales\nsmaller than the spiral arm, and do not include self-gravity.

GMC formation is likely to be strongly dependent\non the nature of the interstellar medium (ISM). Two\nprominent theories that have previously been advanced are\nthat GMCs form by large scale magnetic and/or gravitational instabilities in thermally or turbulently supported\ngas (Elmegreen 1979; Balbus & Cowie 1985; Elmegreen\n1994; Chou et al. 2000; Kim & Ostriker 2006), or by the\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: dobbs@astro.ex.ac.uk\n\ncollisional build up of smaller clouds or clumps (e.g.\nField & Saslaw 1965; Levinson & Roberts 1981; Tomisaka\n1984; Roberts & Stewart 1987; Kwan & Valdes 1987). The\ndifference between these two scenarios is that in the first\nthe ISM behaves essentially as a fluid, whilst in the latter\nthe behaviour is more ballistic. The first case resembles the\nwarm, low density component of the ISM, whilst the second\nappears more consistent with the cold HI or even molecular\ncomponent which is predominantly situated in clumps. In\nthe majority of galaxies, the ISM may be expected to consist of both of these components, with both instabilities and\ncollisions contributing to GMC formation (Zhang & Song\n1999; Dobbs 2008).\nA major limitation of many galactic simulations is\n\n\f2\n\nC. L. Dobbs, S. C. O Glover, P. C. Clark, R. S. Klessen\n\nthat the ISM is assumed to be isothermal, either warm\n(Kim & Ostriker 2002; Slyz et al. 2003; Chakrabarti et al.\n2003; Li et al. 2005, 2006; Shetty & Ostriker 2006) cold\nHI (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006), or a two phase medium\n(Dobbs & Bonnell 2007). In this paper we include a comprehensive treatment of the thermodynamics of the ISM in\nglobal simulations, to investigate whether cooling in spiral\nshocks produces a clumpy, molecular phase even in the absence of self gravity. The only other calculations of heating\nand cooling in grand design galaxies are presented in the\nrecent paper by Wada (2008), who uses an energy equation.\nHere it is possible to see how the nature of the shock changes\nwith time as the gas changes from a warm smooth distribution to cold clumps. A similar approach has been adopted for\nsimulations without a spiral potential, which show complex\nthermal and density distributions (Wada & Norman 2001;\nWada et al. 2002; Tasker & Bryan 2006).\nAnother key issue related to GMC formation is the determination of the timescale over which these clouds are\nformed. Although there is no generally accepted definition\nof the formation timescale, one plausible measure is the time\nrequired for the gas to become fully molecular. To address\nthis, simulations ideally need to include the chemistry of H2 .\nThe formation of H2 has recently been modelled in simulations of dwarf galaxies (Pelupessy et al. 2006), but only a\nvery simplistic treatment has been applied to spiral galaxies\n(Wada et al. 2000; Dobbs et al. 2006).\nSimulations which include a treatment of the thermodynamics of the ISM typically focus on much smaller length\nscales than those we study here (see, for instance, the recent review by Hennebelle et al. 2007). Simulations of shock\ncompressed layers show the formation of structure in the\ncold neutral medium (CNM), and the generation of low levels of turbulence (Koyama & Inutsuka 2002; Heitsch et al.\n2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2006; Hennebelle & Audit\n2007). Even without self gravity, densities in excess\nof 1000 cm\u22123 are produced (Audit & Hennebelle 2005).\nThe inclusion of self gravity leads to star formation\nin the density enhancements from the initial turbulence\n(V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007). In addition to the thermodynamics, Glover & Mac Low (2007b) also follow the evolution of molecular hydrogen, They find that in a turbulent\nenvironment, H2 formation takes place over timescales of a\nfew Myr, suggesting that molecular clouds may form very\nquickly.\nIn previous work (Dobbs et al. 2006), we showed that\nmolecular clouds can form from cold gas by agglomeration\nin a spiral shock (Dobbs 2008). However these isothermal\ncalculations assumed that either cold gas is prevalent in the\nISM, or that warm gas cools very quickly in spiral shocks.\nHere we investigate whether those calculations are plausible,\nby including cooling and heating of the ISM. We include the\nthermodynamics described in Glover & Mac Low (2007a),\nwhich takes into account the main processes responsible for\ncooling and heating of the ISM, rather than assuming a\nprescribed relationship between density and temperature.\nThere are essentially two possible outcomes. If cooling is\nvery rapid in the spiral shock, cold clumps are likely to form\nand the agglomeration of these clumps into GMCs is then\na possibility. In this scenario, we are also interested to see\nwhether the gas remains cold in the interarm regions, and\nwhether spurs can be produced. Alternatively, cooling may\n\nnot be particularly efficient, and little structure is produced\nin the spiral arms. In this case, another mechanism would\nbe required to form GMCs.\n\n2\n\nCALCULATIONS\n\nWe perform these calculations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a Lagrangian fluids code. The code is\nbased on an original version by Benz (Benz et al. 1990),\nbut has since been subject to significant modifications. The\nmost substantial changes include the addition of sink particles (Bate 1995) and magnetic fields (Price & Monaghan\n2005; Price & Bate 2007), although they are not used in the\ncurrent paper. The code also includes individual timesteps\nand variable smoothing lengths. The density and smoothing\nlengths are solved iteratively according to\n\u201e \u00ab1/3\nm\nh=\u03bd\n(1)\n\u03c1\n(Price & Monaghan 2007), where h is the smoothing length,\n\u03c1 the density, m the mass of the particle, and \u03bd is a dimensionless parameter set to 1.2 in order that each particle\nhas \u223c60 neighbours. Artificial viscosity is included to treat\nshocks, using the standard parameters, \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 2\n(Monaghan & Lattanzio 1985).\n2.1\n\nGalactic potential and initial distribution\n\nWe model a gaseous disc, and represent the stellar component of the galaxy by an external potential. The external potential includes a stellar disc, halo and incorporates\na 4 armed spiral component. The potential is described\nin full in Dobbs & Bonnell (2006). The spiral component\nis from Cox & G\u00f3mez (2002) and has a pattern speed of\n2 \u00d7 10\u22128 rad yr\u22121 , and a pitch angle of 15o . The amplitude\nof the stellar spiral perturbation is 1.1 \u00d7 1012 cm2 s\u22122 .\nParticles are initially distributed randomly in a torus\nwith radii 5 kpc < r < 10 kpc. The gas particles are assigned circular velocities according to the disc potential, and\nin addition, a Gaussian velocity dispersion of 6 km s\u22121 is imposed (which constitutes the z component of the velocities).\nThe spiral perturbation emerges with time as the simulation\nprogresses. Initially all the gas has a temperature of 7000 K\nand a scale height of 400 pc. We perform 3 simulations, with\nsurface densities of 4, 10 and 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Although most\ngalaxies do not have average surface densities as low as 4 M\u2299\npc\u22122 , the lowest density calculation would correspond to the\nouter regions of galaxies. The total surface density in our\ncalculations also includes helium, which has an abundance\n(by number) one-tenth that of hydrogen, i.e. n(He) = 0.1n\nwhere n(He) is the number density of helium atoms and n\nis the number density of hydrogen nuclei (in all forms).\nWe neglect both self gravity and magnetic fields in these\ncalculations. These are discussed in previous calculations using an isothermal equation of state (Kim & Ostriker 2002;\nShetty & Ostriker 2006; Dobbs & Price 2008; Dobbs 2008).\nRather, we are interested in whether spiral shocks alone are\nsufficient to cool gas to temperatures of 6 100 K and produce significant amounts of molecular gas. In the next sections we describe the H2 chemistry in these simulations, and\noutline the main thermodynamic processes included.\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n2.2\n\nFormation of H2\n\nThe abundance of molecular gas is computed according to\nthe expression given in Bergin et al. (2004),\ndn(H2 )\n= Rgr (T )n n(H) \u2212 [\u03b6cr + \u03b6diss (N (H2 ), AV )]n(H2 ),\ndt\n(2)\nwhere n(H) and n(H2 ) denote the number densities of H\nand H2 , respectively, n = n(H) + 2n(H2 ) is the total number density of hydrogen nuclei, N (H2 ) is the column density of molecular hydrogen, AV is the visual extinction and\nT is the temperature. The formation rate of H2 on grains\nis Rgr (T )n n(H), where Rgr = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221218 ST 0.5 cm3 s\u22121 .\nThe formation rate assumes that the number density of dust\ngrains is proportional to the total density (Hollenbach et al.\n1971), with the ratio of the dust grain number density to\nthe hydrogen nuclei number density n being incorporated in\nRgr . The parameter S is the efficiency of H2 formation on\ngrains and is assumed to be a constant value of 0.3. In practice, S depends on both the gas temperature and the grain\ntemperature (Hollenbach & McKee 1989; Cazaux & Tielens\n2004). At high temperatures, this is unimportant, as the\ndensity of the warm gas in our simulations is in any case too\nlow to prevent immediate dissociation of almost all of the\nH2 formed on the grains (Dobbs et al. 2006). In cold gas,\non the other hand, we may underestimate the H2 formation\nrate somewhat.\nThe H2 is primarily destroyed by photodissociation.\nThe photodissociation rate in these calculations is given by\n\u03b6diss (N (H2 ), AV ) = fshield (N (H2 ))fdust \u03b6diss (0)\n\n(3)\n\n(Draine & Bertoldi 1996), where \u03b6diss (0) is the photodissociation rate for unshielded H2 , fshield is a factor accounting for\nthe effects of H2 self-shielding, and fdust is a factor accounting for the effects of dust absorption. For the unshielded\nphotodissociation rate, we take \u03b6diss (0) = 4.17 \u00d7 10\u221211 s\u22121 ,\nas appropriate for an ultraviolet radiation field equivalent\nto the galactic average from B0 stars. For fshield , we use the\nfollowing fitting function from Draine & Bertoldi (1996)\nfshield (N (H2 )) =\n\n0.965\n0.035\n+\n(1 + x/3)2\n(1 + x)0.5\n\n(4)\n\n\u00d7 exp[\u22128.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 (1 + x)0.5 ],\nwhere x = N (H2 )/5\u00d71014 cm\u22122 , and where we have assumed\na typical Doppler broadening parameter b = 3 km s\u22121 . For\nfdust , we again follow Draine & Bertoldi (1996) and assume\nthat\nfdust = e\u2212\u03c4d,1000 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c4d,1000 is the optical depth due to dust at a wavelength\n\u03bb = 1000 \u00c5, given by \u03c4d,1000 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221221 (NH + 2NH2 ). For\ngas with RV \u2261 AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1, as is typical of the\ndiffuse ISM, \u03c4d,1000 and the visual extinction AV are related\nby \u03c4d,1000 = 3.74AV .\nIn addition to photodissociation, H2 is subject to destruction by cosmic rays. We assume a constant cosmic ray\nionisation rate of \u03b6cr = 6 \u00d7 10\u221218 s\u22121 , although this term\nis minimal compared to the photodissocation rate, unless\nN (H2 ) or AV are very large.\nDuring the simulation, the fraction of molecular gas is\nalways non-zero; the H2 is never completely photodissociated. When the H2 fraction is very small, the photodis-\n\n3\n\nsociation rate is large, and the requirement that n(H2 ) +\n\u2206tchem \u00d7 dn(H2 )/dt > 0 forces us to use a chemical timestep\n\u2206tchem that is small compared to the other timescales in the\nproblem. To accommodate this without compromising the\noverall efficiency of the code, we subcycle the evolution of\nthe H2 abundance, splitting each hydrodynamical timestep\ninto as many chemical substeps as are required (see also\nGlover & Mac Low 2007a). The abundance of H2 is used to\ndetermine the cooling rate, and so is consistently coupled\nwith the evolution of the energy during the simulation.\n\n2.2.1\n\nCalculating the H and H2 column densities\n\nThe H2 photodissociation rate is strongly coupled to both\nthe H2 column density (through fshield ) and the total column density of hydrogen nuclei, Ntot = N (H) + 2N (H2 )\n(through fdust ). To calculate these column densities, we use\nthe simple estimate that the column density (of H2 or hydrogen nuclei, as appropriate) is just the local density times\nthe typical distance to a B0 star, a constant length scale, lph .\nThe average distance to a B star is likely to be between 20\nand 50 pc depending on which spectral types are included\n(Mihalas & Binney 1981; Reed 2000; Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz 2001).\nWe therefore test 3 different length scales in these simulations. Our fiducial value is lph = 35 pc, but we perform\ncalculations with 15 and 100 pc, to estimate the minimum\nand maximum amounts of H2 that may be produced. In previous calculations (Dobbs et al. 2006; Dobbs 2008) we took\nlph = 100 pc.\n\n2.3\n\nThermodynamics\n\nTo follow the thermal evolution of the gas in our simulations,\nwe use a model for the heating and cooling of atomic and\nmolecular gas taken from Glover & Mac Low (2007a). This\nmodel incorporates cooling from the fine structure emission\nlines of C+ , O, and Si+ , ro-vibrational emission from H2 ,\ngas-grain energy transfer, and recombination on grain surfaces. In hot gas, additional cooling comes from the collisional dissociation of H2 , the collisional ionisation of atomic\nhydrogen, and emission from atomic resonance lines (e.g.\nLyman-\u03b1) and bremsstrahlung. Heating is provided primarily by photoelectric emission from dust grains, with additional contributions coming from cosmic ray ionisation, H2\nphotodissociation, and the pumping of excited vibrational\nstates of H2 by UV excitation or during the formation process of the molecules. Full details of the rates adopted for\nthese various processes can be found in Glover & Mac Low\n(2007a).\nIn dense gas, dust extinction significantly reduces the\nphotoelectric heating rate. We follow Bergin et al. (2004)\nand assume that the heating rate scales with the visual extinction AV as\n\u0393pe (AV ) = \u0393pe (0)e\u22122.5AV ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u0393pe (0) is the photoelectric heating rate in optically\nthin gas, and where AV is calculated as in section 2.2 above.\nAside from our simplified treatment of the dust extinction, the main approximation that we have made is our\nneglect of the effects of emission from atomic carbon and\nsilicon (which are not tracked in our chemical model) and\n\n\f4\n\nC.

This simplification means that the temperature\nof the dense, highly molecular gas in our simulations will\nnot be computed entirely correctly. However, at the densities probed by our current simulations, the errors involved\nshould be small, since C+ cooling is comparable in effectiveness to CO cooling, as the significant quantities of cold gas\nproduced in our simulations readily demonstrate (see e.g.\nsection 3.1.1; see also Glover & Jappsen 2007). Moreover,\nwe would expect the dynamics of this cold, dense component to be dominated by turbulent motions, rendering its\nprecise temperature of limited importance.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nDetails of the different calculations performed are shown in\nTable 1. We adopt 3 different surface densities, since the\ndegree of collisional cooling in the disc is expected to depend predominantly on the density. As described in Section 2.3.1, three different length scales are used to calculate\nthe photodissociation rate, which determines the molecular\ngas abundance. The next sections describe the structure of\nthe disc for the different surface densities, and the resulting\nthermal distributions. The evolution of H2 is discussed in\nSection 3.2, including the amount of gas in the disc which\nbecomes molecular and the timescales for H2 formation. For\nthe simulations in the main part of the paper, we use 8\nmillion particles, but we also performed simulations with 1\nand 4 million particles to investigate the dependence of our\nresults on resolution (see Appendix).\n3.1\n\nStructure of the disc\n\nThe galactic disc is shown for the different surface densities in Figs 1 and 2. In all cases, the disc exhibits a large\ndegree of substructure. The morphology of the disc is similar to that seen in previous isothermal calculations of cold\ngas (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006). This is because, as will be discussed in Section 3.1.1, a substantial amount of cold gas is\nformed in all of these calculations, and dense features such\nas clumps and spurs are produced in the cold gas.\nFigure 1 shows the structure of the disc for our standard\nmodel, with \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and lph = 35 pc, at 3 times\nduring the evolution of the disc. At the earlest time, there is\nnot substantial substructure, but small spurs are beginning\nto emerge from the spiral arm (the transition between gas\nthat has passed through a strong shock and gas which has\n\nFigure 1. The evolution of the galactic disc is shown for the\nstandard case, where \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and lph = 35 pc. The\ndisc contains a substantial degree of substructure, in agreement\nwith previous isothermal calculations (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006).\nGas cools and becomes dense in the spiral arms, leading to the\nagglomeration of clumps into larger structures which shear off the\nspiral arms to become spurs (lower panels).\n\nnot is evident: up to a radius of between 7 and 8 kpc, all\nthe material has passed through at least one shock). At this\nstage, there is cold gas in the spiral arms, but little substructure has yet developed. By 240 Myr, the structure in\nthe disc is very similar to previous isothermal calculations\n(Dobbs & Bonnell 2006), with spurs extending into the interarm regions. The spiral shock causes the cold gas in the\nspiral arms to clump together (Dobbs et al. 2006; Dobbs\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. The pressure is plotted against number density for\n100,000 random particles. The distribution shows gas at stable\npoints corresponding to temperatures of 100 (n\u223c20 cm\u22123 ) and\n104 K (n\u223c0.1 cm\u22123 ) with unstable gas between these regimes.\n\nthe structure. There is little difference between the higher\nsurface density cases. However there is comparatively more\ndense gas, both in the spiral arms and the interarm structures, than in the 4 M\u2299 pc\u22122 run. For the higher surface\ndensity discs, more of the gas reaches very low temperatures, of \u223c 10 K. This very cold gas is denser, and remains\nat high densities for longer. The density is also noticeably\nlower in the interarm regions compared to the lower surface\ndensity case.\n\n3.1.1\n\nFigure 2. The column density of the disc is shown after 240\nMyr for the models with surface densities of 4 (top) 10 (middle)\nand 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (lower). The structure is similar for all surface\ndensities, although more high density gas is apparent in the arm\nand interarm regions for the 10 and 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 cases. The scales\nhave been chosen so that they are proportional to the average\ncolumn density.\n\n2008) and these clumps emerge from the spiral arms as distinct spurs.\nIn Fig. 2, the results for the different surface densities\nare displayed. The corresponding time is 240 Myr, and \u03a3 =\n4 (top), 10 (middle) and 20 (lower) M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Even the\nlower surface density case shows a high degree of substructure, since there is still a large component of cold gas. In all\ncases, since the cold gas is the most dense, this dominates\n\nThermal distribution of the gas\n\nIn the previous section, we highlighted that cooling of gas in\nthe spiral shocks is sufficient for gas to form dense clumps\nin the spiral arms, which in turn lead to interarm features.\nHere we discuss in more detail the thermal distribution of\nthe gas. Overall, except for the lowest surface density case,\nthe largest proportion of gas ends up in the cold phase.\nFigure 3 shows the pressure distribution versus number\ndensity of a selection of particles from the disc. Generally\nthere is a tight correlation between the pressure and density. The distribution corresponds to a two phase medium,\nwith stable points at \u223c 104 K and 100 K. There is however\ngas with 0.01 . n . 1 cm\u22123 which exhibits a lower than\nexpected pressure. This represents gas which has recently\npassed through the spiral arms, but has not yet heated back\nup to equilibrium pressure. This gas is only a few per cent\nof the total amount of gas. Conversely, there are no gas particles which have higher than expected pressures, since we\ndo not include any heating of the dense gas by supernovae.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the distribution of temperature for\nthe different surface density simulations. All show peaks at\naround 100 and 104 K, as expected from the two phase\nmodel of Field (1965). There is more warm (104 K) gas\nin the lower surface density models, whilst at higher surface densities, more of the gas cools to temperatures below 100 K. There is also a significant amount of gas in\nthe thermally unstable regime, as has been noted in previous simulations (Gazol et al. 2001; Kritsuk & Norman 2002;\n\n\f6\n\nC. L. Dobbs, S. C.

The percentage of gas which is cold (T 6 150 K)\n(blue), warm (T > 5000 K) (red) and in the unstable regime (150\nK 6 T 6 5000 K) (green) is shown versus time for the 4 (dotted),\n10 (solid) and 20 (dashed) M\u2299 pc\u22122 surface density calculations.\n\nV\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2003; de Avillez & Breitschwerdt\n2004; Piontek & Ostriker 2005). In the 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 model\nplotted here, the photodissociation length scale is lph = 35\npc; there are only small differences in the distribution for the\nother length scales, mainly at low temperatures where the\namount of molecular gas, and therefore the mean molecular\nweight \u03bc differs.\nThe evolution of the amount of gas in the cold (T 6\n150 K), unstable (150 K 6 T 6 5000 K) and warm\n(T > 5000 K) phases is shown in Fig. 5. Clearly the amount\nof cold gas in the disc increases with surface density. At the\noutset, all the gas is in the warm regime, at 7000 K. Gas\nwhich does not immediately enter a spiral arm cools to a\n\nfew 1000 K, in the thermally unstable regime. Gas entering\nthe spiral shock cools to much lower temperatures of a few\n100 K. As the shock develops further, the gas continues to\ncool, to temperatures of \u223c100 K. From Fig. 5, we see that\nthe amount of cold gas grows over a period of approximately\n30 Myr, comparable to the typical crossing time in the spiral\narms. Much of the gas cools to temperatures of < 150 K,\nbut a small proportion of the gas also heats back up to the\nwarm stable regime. After further spiral arm passages the\namount of gas in each phase does not change significantly.\nOver the course of each simulation, the evolution of the\ncold and unstable phases appear synchronised, whilst the\namount of warm gas is fairly constant after 100 Myr. This\nsuggests that transitions occur predominantly from the cold\nto unstable phases and vice versa. However, we should again\nstress that we do not include heating from supernovae, or\nfrom other forms of stellar feedback (e.g. winds) in these\ncalculations.\nBy 200 Myr (approximately 2 rotations), the amount of\ngas in each phase is relatively stable. Except for the low surface density case, the largest proportion of the gas is cold.\nTable 2 compares the amount of gas in each phase for the\ndifferent simulations after 250 Myr. There are only few observational estimates of the fractions of gas in the different\nregimes. Heiles & Troland (2003) estimate that \u223c 40% of the\nHI in the solar neighbourhood is cold, 30% is unstable and\n30% is warm. In our simulations, however, the cold component includes molecular gas. Thus discounting the molecular\ngas (which is predominantly cold), the percentages of HI in\nthe cold, unstable and warm regimes are approximately 62,\n31 and 6% for the 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 calculation.\nSeveral numerical simulations consider cooling and\nheating in local regions of the ISM, usually applying periodic boundary conditions. Piontek & Ostriker (2005) obtain similar proportions to the 10 and 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 results\n(which represent a comparable average n) for 3D simulations\nof MRI driven turbulence, as do Kim et al. (2008) for 1D calculations of gas subject to spiral shocks. For 2D simulations\nof driven turbulence, Gazol et al. (2001) find half the gas is\nunstable and a quarter warm or cold. Audit & Hennebelle\n(2005) also model turbulence and obtain relatively low fractions of cold and unstable gas (\u223c 30% total) but this may\nwell be due to their boundary conditions; they use inflow\nconditions with a constant injection of warm gas, rather than\na fixed mass of gas.\nFew global simulations have investigated the thermodynamics of the ISM. Wada & Norman (2001) include stellar\nfeedback as well as the thermodynamics in their 2D models of galactic discs, although the structure formed in their\nsimulations is due to self gravity rather than spiral shocks.\nThey find approximately 2/3 of the gas lies in the cold\nregime, 20% is unstable and the remainder is hot gas. Recent\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n\n7\n\nnon-isothermal 3D simulations of flocculent spirals include\nTasker & Bryan (2008) and Robertson & Kravtsov (2008),\nbut they adopt minimum temperatures of 300 and 100 K\nrespectively, and so cannot properly address this question.\n3.1.2\n\nSpatial distribution of warm and cold gas\n\nFigure 6 displays cross sections of the temperature for a\nsection of disc (with z = 0), for the 3 different surface densities. Evidently there is much more cold gas at higher surface densities (lower panels), which is situated in the spiral\narms and the interarm clumps. The warm gas is only visible between the cold clumps, although it is fairly ubiquitous\nacross the disc. Essentially the warm gas behaves independently of the cold, and from particle plots, the warm phase\nappears to shock earlier than the cold gas, as seen in Fig. 2\nof Dobbs & Bonnell (2007).\nThe scale height of the warm gas is much larger than\nthe cold (Fig. 7), with warm gas extending to 400 pc or so\nabove the plane of the disc. The cold gas is confined within\n100 pc of the plane. It is also apparent from Figs 6 and 7\nthat the volume of cold gas (especially below 100 K) is much\nsmaller compared to the percentage of cold gas by mass.\n3.2\n\nEvolution of molecular hydrogen\n\nThe remaining part of this paper discusses the formation\nand evolution of molecular hydrogen. The total amount of\nH2 in the disc is compared for the different surface densities\nand assumed photodissociation scale lengths in this section.\nThe evolution of molecular hydrogen is also considered in\nSections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4, in context with the other variables\nin the simulation, i.e. density, temperature, as well as the\npassage of gas through a spiral shock. We present many of\nthe results in this section in terms of the H2 fraction, which\nwe define as fH2 = 2n(H2 )/(n(H) + 2n(H2 )).\nThe time evolution of the percentage of H2 in the disc\nfor the different simulations is shown in Fig. 8. As expected,\nthe amount of H2 increases with surface density, and the\nscale length for the photodissociation, lph which determines\nthe H2 column density. From Fig. 8, the percentage of H2\nscales approximately linearly with the surface density. This\nsame dependence on surface density was also found in previous isothermal calculations (Dobbs et al. 2006). From the\nlower panel comparing lph we see that a higher estimate\nof N(H2 ) increases the self-shielding of the molecular gas\n(Eq. 3) and thus allows more H2 to survive. However, the\ndependence of the mean molecular fraction on lph is relatively weak: an increase in lph of almost a factor of seven\nincreases the mean molecular fraction by no more than a\nfactor of two. As realistic values of lph lie within the range\n15 < lph < 100 pc, this demonstrates that the uncertainty\nintroduced by our simplified treatment of H2 self-shielding\nis unlikely to be very large.\nThe fraction of H2 is seen to peak after around 180 Myr,\ncorresponding to about 2 spiral arm passages (for gas at the\nmidpoint of the disc). The amount of H2 then levels out at\napproximately 7, 20 and 38 % for the 4, 10 and 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122\nsurface density discs respectively. For comparison, at the solar radius, the surface density of H2 from models of the ISM\nis thought to be 1 \u2013 2 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , whilst the total surface density is \u223c 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (including He) (Wolfire et al. 2003).\n\nFigure 6. A cross section (where z = 0) of the temperature is\ndisplayed for a section of the disc for the 4 (top), 10 (middle) and\n20 (lower) M\u2299 pc\u22122 surface density discs. There is more cold gas,\n< 100 K, in the higher surface density calculations.\n\nFigure 7. A cross section showing the temperature in the zx\nplane (y = 0) for a section of the disc.

The molecular gas fraction is shown versus azimuth\nfor a ring located at the midpoint of the disc, at times of 120\nMyr (solid) and 240 Myr (dotted). At the earlier time, there is\ncold, dense molecular gas in the spiral arms, but this gas quickly\nwarms up and photodissociates on leaving the spiral arms. On\nthe other hand, by 240 Myr, gas in the spiral arms has reached\nmuch higher densities of H2 and large clumps break away into the\ninterarm regions, which have a high molecular gas content.\n\nFigure 8. The percentage of molecular gas in the disc is shown\nversus time. In the top panel, the results for the different surface\ndensity cases are plotted, whilst the lower panel shows the cases\nfor different photodissociation length scales (the assumed distance\nto a B0 star).\n\nIn our \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 simulation, the surface density of\nH2 is 2 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Observations suggest the percentage of\nneutral HI which is molecular over the whole of the Milky\nWay is between 20 and 40% (e.g. Ferri\u00e8re 2001).\n3.2.1\n\nAzimuthal and radial distribution of molecular\nhydrogen\n\nFigure 9 shows the H2 fraction versus azimuth, for the fiducial case with a surface density of 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 and lph = 35\npc. The H2 fraction is calculated by selecting a ring located\nat 7.5 kpc of width 200 pc. The ring is divided into 200 segments azimuthally and the H2 fraction is averaged in each.\nAt the earlier time of 120 Myr, the H2 is clearly concentrated\nin the spiral arms. This gas has not reached sufficiently high\ndensities that molecular gas survives into the interarm regions. The gas heats up and almost immediately dissociates\nwhen leaving the arm. However, after 240 Myr, there are\npeaks situated in the interarm regions, in addition to those\ncorresponding to the spiral arms.\nIn Fig. 10 we show the radial distribution of H2 , HI and\ntotal HI+H2 after 240 Myr. The surface density is calculated\n\nFigure 10. The surface density of HI, H2 and total HI+H2 is\nplotted versus radius for the fiducial calculation with \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299\npc\u22122 and lph =35 pc. The corresponding time is 240 Myr. The\nsurface density profile of HI is relatively flat, whereas that for the\nmolecular gas falls off with radius.\n\nby dividing the mass of gas in a ring at a given radius, by\nthe area occupied by the ring. The HI is fairly flat across\nthe disc, whilst the H2 falls off with radius. The density of\nthe gas tends to be underestimated at the edge of the disc\nthough, so there is less molecular gas than expected. The\ndecreasing H2 surface density occurs since the spiral arms\nare further apart at larger radii and the molecular gas is\npredominantly in, or formed in, the spiral arms.\n3.2.2\n\nPDFs of the gas density\n\nThe (mass-weighted) PDF is shown in Fig. 11, for both the\ntotal gas in the disc, and the molecular gas. The cumula-\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n\nFigure 11. The mass of gas is shown versus density for the fiducial calculation with \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . The mass for the total gas\nand the molecular gas is plotted, and dashed lines indicate the\ncumulative mass of gas. The mass distribution for the total gas is\napproximated between n=10 cm\u22123 and 100 cm\u22123 by a lognormal\ndistribution f(\u03bc, \u03c3), where \u03bc = 7.5 and \u03c3 = 2.46.\n\ntive mass is also plotted. We find that the total gas PDF is\napproximated by a lognormal distribution, as discussed in\nrecent simulations (Wada & Norman 2007; Tasker & Bryan\n2008). However the molecular gas does not follow a lognormal distribution. The figure indicates that there is negligible\nH2 below 5 cm\u22123 (the self shielding limit, see Section 3.2.3)\nand thus the total amount of H2 above this density is the\nsame as the total H2 in the disc.\n\n3.2.3\n\nSelf-shielding and the formation of molecular\nhydrogen\n\nWhether gas in the ISM is primarily atomic or molecular is expected to depend on the efficiency of self shielding\n(e.g. Federman et al. 1979; Elmegreen 1993; Browning et al.\n2003). We plot the molecular gas fraction versus density in\nFig. 12. The most striking feature of these results is the large\nincrease in molecular gas fraction at a specific density. For\nthe fiducial case with lph = 35 pc (top panel), this density\nis \u223c 5 cm\u22123 . This is the density at which self shielding of\nthe H2 becomes effective, and the fraction of molecular gas\ncan continuously increase with time. Below this density, the\nH2 fraction of the gas is in equilibrium. The time to obtain molecular fractions of 0.1-1% is very rapid, comparable\nto the timestep of our calculations (0.5 Myr). Hence there\nare few particles with molecular fractions between 10\u22126 and\n10\u22123 . The colour scheme indicates the mass of gas at a particular H2 fraction for a given density. As will be shown\nlater, the particles exhibit various trajectories on this plot.\nGas which increases in density sufficiently to become significantly molecular follows a very similar path from low to high\nH2 fractions, hence the large mass of gas between n = 0.1\nand 100 cm\u22123 .\nFigure 13 also compares the H2 fraction for the different simulations. Here the molecular gas fraction is averaged\n\n9\n\nFigure 12. The fraction of molecular gas is plotted against number density for all the gas in the disc. The colour scheme indicates\nthe amount of mass with a particular H2 fraction for a given density.\n\nover all particles at a given density, although the spread in\nH2 fraction is similar to Fig. 12 for each case. The top panel\ncompares the simulations with different surface density. The\ndependence of the H2 fraction on density does not change\nfor the different surface density calculations. Clearly when\n\u03a3 = 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 though, much more of the gas resides at\nhigh densities, and therefore high H2 fractions. The situation changes when considering different lph values (lower\npanel). The effect of increasing lph is to decrease the threshold density at which self shielding becomes important. This\nthreshold depends on N (H2 ) = n(H2 ) lph rather than n. So\nwhen lph = 100 pc the gas only has to exceed densities of\nn \u223c 2 cm\u22123 to start attaining a high molecular gas fraction\n(and as seen in Fig. 8, lower panel, there is more molecular\ngas overall), compared to n \u223c 8 cm\u22123 when lph = 15 pc.\nFigure 13 indicates that a large fraction of the gas is\nmolecular at moderate densities, e.g. 10-30% for n = 2 \u2212 10\ncm\u22123 and 50% or more once the density exceeds 100 cm\u22123 .\nWe stress again that this is a mean fraction, which includes\ngas that is currently decreasing both its density and H2 fraction, possibly having already spent many Myr at densities\nabove the self shielding limit. Furthermore the H2 fraction\nvaries with metallicity, extinction and UV flux, all of which\nare assumed to be constant in our model. For comparison,\nin calculations performed by Pelupessy et al. (2006), the\nmolecular gas fraction at n = 100 cm\u22123 is \u223c 0.4, 0.9 or\n> 0.9, depending on metallicity, UV flux and the formation\nrate of H2 on grains. In Koyama & Inutsuka (2000), substantial molecular fractions are not reached until n = 1000\ncm\u22123 , but this is probably a consequence of lower column\ndensities, since they consider a localised slab of gas. Finally,\nin Glover & Mac Low (2007b), turbulent clouds with mean\ndensities of 10 and 100 cm\u22123 develop molecular gas fractions of \u223c 0.1 and 0.4 respectively within only a few Myr,\nconsistent with the fractions we find here.\nWe can also consider the evolution of particles as their\ndensity and molecular gas fraction change. Figure 14 shows\nevolutionary tracks of 3 particles from the simulation with\nlph = 35 pc and \u03a3 = 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . The top panel is the most\ntypical (i.e. frequent) path for a particle. As a particle enters\n\n\f10\n\nC. L. Dobbs, S. C. O Glover, P. C. Clark, R. S. Klessen\never in reality many of the trajectories in Fig. 12 would be\ninterrupted at high densities by star formation processes.\nThe lower panels in Fig. 14 indicate the evolution of two\ngas particles which behave somewhat differently. The middle panel indicates an example where a particle exhibits a\nhigh molecular gas fraction for most of the calculation. This\nis because once the gas attains a large molecular fraction, it\nencounters another spiral shock before becoming photodissociated to a very low H2 fraction. The gas particle in the\nlowest panel exhibits the opposite behaviour. It lies in the\nwarm regime, at a larger scale height. The gas does not experience a shock since it is too warm and diffuse. Thus the\ndensity does not become sufficiently high for the fluid element to attain a significant H2 fraction.\n\n3.2.4\n\nFigure 13. The molecular gas fraction is shown averaged over\nparticles at a given number density. In the top panel, results are\nplotted from the different surface density calculations. The H2\nfraction at different densities is similar regardless of the surface\ndensity. The lower panels compare results with different photodissociation approximations. When assuming a large scale length\nand therefore column density, the threshold for self shielding shifts\nto lower densities (100 pc case).\n\na spiral shock, its density increases, and the particle evolves\nalong the right hand side of the distribution of particles in\nFig. 12. At some point, the density of the particle starts to\ndecrease, and the particle evolves to the left in H2 fraction\nversus n space. This accounts for the large spread in the\nH2 fraction apparent for densities > 5 cm\u22123 in Fig. 12. But\nalthough the particle's density decreases, it still retains a\nhigh molecular gas fraction. Thus the evolution in H2 fraction is quite different depending on whether the particle's\ndensity is increasing or decreasing. The reason for this is\nbecause once the fluid element has attained a high molecular gas fraction, the column density N (H2 ) is large and\nself shielding (denoted by fshield in Eq. 2) prevents the H2\nfrom rapidly becoming photodissociated. Thus the gas can\nexhibit higher H2 fractions at lower densities compared to\nbefore the gas enters the shock (where N (H2 ) and the degree\nof self shielding is negligible). A similar scenario is described\nin Pelupessy et al. (2006), who even find that molecular gas\ncan survive the transition from the CNM to the WNM. How-\n\nEvolution of physical variables during the simulation\n\nThis section describes how the density, H2 fraction and temperature evolve with time for specific gas particles in the\nsimulation. Fig. 15 shows the evolution of the various physical quantities with time, as well as the distance to the nearest potential minimum, for the three particles already depicted in Fig. 14. The corresponding galactic radii for the\nparticles are 7.4 kpc (top), 5.1 kpc (middle) and 6 kpc (lower\npanel). For particles at larger galactic radii, there are correspondingly fewer minima in the variation of the distance to\nthe potential minimum with time, indicating fewer passages\nthrough the stellar spiral arm.\nThe top panel shows the typical behaviour of gas as it\ntravels round the disc. After 30 to 40 Myr, the gas particle passes the potential minimum and enters a spiral shock.\nThe gas experiences a sharp increase in density, and a corresponding drop in temperature to \u223c 100 K. The increase\nin molecular gas fraction is similarly rapid, changing from\n\u223c 10\u22126 to \u223c 10\u22123 in a single timestep (0.5 Myr). A further\nincrease to the peak fraction of \u223c 0.1 takes around 10 Myr.\nThe gas then remains in the spiral arm for another 40 to\n50 Myr. After leaving the spiral arm, the gas becomes less\ndense and heats up. At the same time, the gas experiences a\nsudden drop in the H2 fraction, decreasing to \u223c 10\u22126 in 10\nMyr or so. The gas enters a spiral shock for the second time\nafter 190 Myr. By this time, the spiral shock is more developed and the gas reaches higher densities. Consequently it\ncools to \u223c20 K and attains a molecular gas fraction of 0.7.\nAgain the time to acquire this fraction is short, around 10\nMyr. At this point in the simulations there is much more interarm structure, with clumps breaking off into the interarm\nregions. The gas retains a higher density and H2 fraction for\na longer period, including time when gas has left the spiral\nshock, but drops down to lower densities and a very small\nH2 fraction by 300 Myr.\nThe middle panel in Fig. 14 shows the evolution of gas\nwhich retains a high density throughout most of the simulation (as also described in Section 3.2.3). This gas is nearer\nthe inner edge of the disc and experiences more frequent\nspiral arm passages. The density does not decrease sufficiently for the H2 fraction to return to 10\u22126 . Consequently\nthe molecular gas fraction stays between 10\u22123 and 0.1, whilst\nthe temperature remains around 100 K (thus the gas remains\nin the cold regime for the rest of the simulation). Finally in\nthe third panel, the gas never attains a significant fraction\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n\nFigure 14. The trajectories of three particles are shown in H2\nfraction versus density space. The colour of the plotted lines\nchanges with time, with red at t = 0 Myr to black at 310 Myr\n(arrows also indicate the direction the particles evolve over time).\nIn the top panel, the gas (twice) reaches a high molecular gas\nfraction and then drops down to lower densities with very low\nmolecular gas fractions. This pattern is typical for most particles\nin the disc. The average galactic radius for each of the particles is\nalso indicated on the panels. The evolution of H2 fraction, density\nand temperature are shown with time in the corresponding plots\nin Fig. 15.\n\n11\n\nFigure 15. The evolution of density, H2 fraction, temperature\nand column density is shown versus time for 3 particles (a different\nparticle in the top, middle and lower panels). The distance to the\nnearest potential minimum was also calculated and is shown in\nthese figures. The top panel shows fairly typical behaviour as\nthe gas passes through the spiral shock, where the H2 fraction\nincreases in the spiral arm and then decreases. In the middle\npanel, after the first spiral shock, the gas retains a high density\nand H2 fraction throughout the simulation. For the third panel,\nthe gas density never gets very large, the gas has negligible H2 ,\nand remains in the warm phase of the ISM. The galactic radii of\nthe particles are indicated on each of the panels.\n\n\f12\n\nC. L. Dobbs, S. C. O Glover, P. C. Clark, R. S. Klessen\n\nof H2 . The gas remains too warm and diffuse throughout the\nsimulation.\nWe compared the profiles of 100 random particles, finding that the majority of particles (60-70%) exhibit evolutionary patterns similar to the top panel of Fig. 14, i.e. the\nmolecular gas fraction increases and decreases by orders of\nmagnitude during and after each spiral passage. A few particles have high densities and molecular gas fractions for most\nof the simulation, similar to the middle panel, but these tend\nto be nearer the centre of the disc. A particular gas particle\ndoes not always exhibit the same behaviour through each\nspiral arm, e.g. gas may be low density and not molecular\nat the beginning of the simulation, but increase its peak\ndensity during successive spiral arm passages. Conversely a\ngas particle may be dense and have a high molecular gas\nfraction before 100 Myr, but then move into a low density\nregion between spiral arms, and become low density atomic\ngas for the rest of the simulation.\n3.2.5\n\nTimescales for the formation and destruction of H2\n\nThe questions of how quickly molecular clouds form, and\nhow long they live, are central to any model of star formation. The simulations performed for this study can provide\nan insight into these timescales.\nFigure 16, shows the time taken for the gas to achieve\nan H2 mass fraction of 0.5. The characteristic time required\nfor raising the molecular fraction from 0.1 to 0.5 is around\n10 Myr, which is roughly the time needed to cross the spiral\narm. We stress here that the values given in Fig. 16 are upper limits, since we do not have the resolution to treat the\ninternal turbulent motions in the spiral arms fully consistently. Glover & Mac Low (2007b) demonstrated that turbulence at and below the GMC scale can induce H2 formation on an internal crossing time. Dobbs & Bonnell (2007)\nshowed that when structured gas is passed through a shock\nit generates turbulence that is consistent with the typical velocity scaling laws found in molecular clouds (Larson 1981;\nHeyer et al. 2004). The fact that the typical timescale for\ngoing between molecular fractions from 0.01 to 0.1 is faster\nthan from fractions 0.1 to 0.5 is indicative of the resolution constraint our calculations. It is therefore likely that\nthe unresolved velocity structure in the spiral arms would\naccelerate the formation of H2 to rates higher than we quote\nhere. Self-gravity would increase these rates further still and\nas such, one would expect the peaks in the formation time\ndistributions to move to lower values.\nThe ability of a parcel of gas (in this case, an SPH\nparticle) to gain a large H2 fraction, depends on its path\nthrough the spiral arm, and hence the level of compression\nthat it experiences. Two effects are important here. The first\nis 'orbit crowding', whereby gas streams from different radii\nare brought together by the spiral potential due to their\nrelative motions. This increases the density of the gas that\nundergoes a shock during its passage through the spiral. The\nsecond effect is simply that gas entering the spiral arm will\nundergo a stronger shock if the gas already residing in that\npart of the spiral arm is cold.\nAt earlier stages in the simulation, the spiral shock is\nnot well developed. Warm gas experiences compression and\nachieves low (\u223c100 K) temperatures, but usually only moderate H2 fractions (e.g. Fig. 9, Fig. 15 top panel). However,\n\nsubsequent gas entering the shock now encounters cold gas.\nThis gas experiences not only compression by the shock,\nbut collides with cold clumps in the shock. As a result, the\ngas experiences stronger compression, cools to lower temperatures and can obtain a higher H2 fraction. With time,\nthis process repeats, and the gas in the spiral shock becomes colder and more molecular. Eventually a steady state\nis reached (Fig. 8), by which time gas can enter the shock\nand achieve high H2 fractions in 10 to 20 Myr. The formation\nof GMCs is thereby facilitated by the pre-existence of dense,\ncold material, as hypothesised by Pringle et al. (2001).\nThe density reached in the spiral arms also depends on\nthe density and temperature of gas entering the shock (e.g\nFig. 15, middle and lower panels). Gas which is in the midplane of the galaxy, or which has not fully heated up after\npassing the previous arm, is denser and colder and is more\nlikely to achieve a high H2 fraction (Fig. 15, middle). As\ndiscussed in Section 3.3.1, much of the gas lingers at densities around 0.1 to 1 cm\u22123 and temperatures of several hundred Kelvin. This places it in the regime where self-shielding\nstarts to become important (see Figures 11 & 12). As such,\nthe gas remains in a regime where it can easily increase its\nmolecular fraction during the compression produced by the\nspiral arm passage. Gas at low density, e.g. above the mid\nplane, may pass through the spiral arm without obtaining a\nsignificant increase in H2 fraction (Fig. 15, lower). Overall,\nthe combination of orbit crowding and collisions between\nparcels of cold gas that is described above creates large cold\nmolecular complexes. Between passages through the spiral\narms, these parcels of cold gas typically do not maintain a\nhigh H2 fraction.\nFinally Fig. 17 indicates the time gas spends above\ngiven molecular fractions. The gas tends to spend more\ntime at higher H2 fractions. We can relate this behaviour\nto Fig. 14, which shows the trajectories of particles in H2\nversus n space. The particles' trajectories form loops, which\nincrease in size as the gas reaches higher densities. Gas which\nreaches the high density regime is highly molecular and takes\na longer time to photodissociate back to lower H2 fractions.\nFig. 17 indicates that gas which reaches an H2 fraction of\n0.01 usually retains this fraction for only 10 to 20 Myr. However gas which goes on to obtain H2 fractions of 0.5 retains\nthis H2 fraction for \u223c40 Myr. This is clearly an upper limit\nfor the expected cloud lifetime, as we do not include star\nformation and stellar feedback. The strong UV radiation\nand winds from newly formed massive stars would accelerate molecular cloud disruption.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe calculations presented in this paper demonstrate\nthat the atomic and molecular cooling discussed in\nGlover & Mac Low (2007a) permits the formation of molecular clouds in spiral shocks. Warm gas flowing into the spiral\npotential is compressed, enabling it to cool to low temperatures, and initiating the rapid formation of H2 in the cold\ngas. By 'rapid' we mean that large quantities of H2 form in\nroughly a crossing time, consistent with the ideas presented\nby a number of previous studies (Vazquez-Semadeni et al.\n1996; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999; Koyama & Inutsuka\n2000; Elmegreen 2000; Pringle et al. 2001).\n\n\fCooling in spiral shocks\n\nFigure 16. This histogram gives the distribution of timescales\nover which the gas reaches certain molecular gas fractions. The\ntimescales denote the time for the H2 fraction of a particle to\nincrease from 0.001 to 0.01, 0.01 to 0.1 and 0.1 to 0.5, as indicated.\n\nFigure 17. This figure shows the distribution of timescales gas\nremains over molecular gas fractions of 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5. Gas\ntypically spends about 40 Myr with a molecular gas fraction of >\n0.5. This is however an upper limit on a molecular cloud lifetime,\nsince stellar feedback is not included in these models.\n\nOur results differ from the two competing theories\nof GMC formation. In one, cloud formation is driven by\nself-gravity (e.g. Elmegreen 1979), and H2 formation occurs on the cloud collapse timescale (which may be significantly longer than the free-fall time for clouds that have a\nhigh level of turbulent or magnetic support). In the other,\nGMC formation occurs through the coalescence of many\nsmall cloudlets, which are dense but not self-gravitating\n(Pringle et al. 2001). Our calculations cannot directly address the first of these scenarios, since we do not include the\neffects of the self-gravity of the gas. However, our results\ndo highlight the importance of the gravitational potential\nof the spiral arm for driving the formation of GMCs. Orbit\ncrowding within the spiral arm leads to cloud coalescence,\n\n13\n\nas discussed in Section 3.2.5. The final picture is therefore\nsimilar to that proposed by Pringle et al. (2001).\nThe rapid formation of molecular clouds as\nsuggested in the current study, as well as in a\nnumber of more detailed chemical and dynamical calculations (e.g. Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999;\nBallesteros-Paredes & Hartmann 2007; Glover & Mac Low\n2007a,b; Hartmann et al. 2001; Heitsch et al. 2006, 2008;\nHennebelle et al. 2007, 2008; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n2006, 2007), agrees well with current observational data.\nFor example, it is consistent with the geometrically derived\nfast star formation timescales in 14 nearby spiral galaxies\nobserved with the VLT and the Spitzer infrared satellite.\nTamburro et al. (2008) measure the average angular offset\nbetween the Hi and 24 \u03bcm emissivity peaks along spiral\narms and find typical timescales for the onset of star\nformation in this sample of below 5 million years. Earlier\nstudies on the position of dust emission, Hi, Hii, and H\u03b1\nline from young stars measured across spiral shocks in\nM51 and M83 (Allen et al. 1986; Tilanus & Allen 1989;\nLeisawitz et al. 1989) come to similar conclusions. Short\ncloud formation timescales are also consistent with the\nstellar age spread in molecular clouds which exhibit a short\npeak of star-formation activity of 1 to 2 millions years\nduration (Hartmann et al. 2001; Hartmann 2003), possibly\npreceded by an acceleration period with very low activity\nof up to 10 million years (e.g. Palla & Stahler 2000, 2002).\nAltogether, we conclude that a cloud formation timescale\nof about 10 million years or less as suggested by our\ncalculations is consistent with observational data (see also\nElmegreen 2000, 2007).\nOur study addresses another fundamental point of\nGMC formation: local self-gravity is not required to form\nmolecular clouds. The 'clouds', or complexes of molecular\ngas, are simply a result of a change in chemical state brought\nabout by the processes described above. It is not necessary to\nassume that GMCs are dominated by self-gravity. In particular, GMCs need not be in virial equilibirum, as previously\nnoted by Pringle et al. (2001). The path to molecular cloud\nformation is already underway at densities of 0.1 to 1 cm\u22123\nand at temperatures of around 100 \u2013 300 K, the regime in\nwhich the self-shielding becomes effective. The free-fall time\nat this density is around 50 Myr. Since this is longer than the\ntypical cloud formation timescale, it is unlikely that gravity can play a dominant role in the formation of molecular\nclouds. Additionally, self-gravity has to overcome turbulence\npresent in the ISM, and tidal shear from the galaxy potential. Given these conditions, it seems likely that globally\nunbound GMCs can form, in which the star formation efficiency would be naturally quite low (Clark et al. 2005).\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe simulations presented in this paper indicate that cooling\nin spiral shocks leads to the formation of molecular clouds\nin the spiral arms of a galaxy. Self gravity of the gas is not\nrequired for this process. Cooling of the gas is very quick as\ngas enters the shock (almost instantaneous), hence cold gas\nclumps can agglomerate into larger structures, as described\nin previous isothermal simulations (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006;\nDobbs et al. 2006; Dobbs 2008), within the spiral shock.\n\n\f14\n\nC. L. Dobbs, S. C. O Glover, P. C. Clark, R. S. Klessen\n\nLarger GMCs form after successive shocks, once both the\narm and interarm material has become colder and denser.\nAgain, similar to previous calculations, these clumps are\nsheared into interarm spurs.\nFor a disc of surface density comparable to the solar neighbourhood, around 70% of the gas lies in the cold\nregime, and 20% is molecular. The transition from atomic to\nmolecular gas is shown to be strongly dependent on the self\nshielding limit. Spiral shocks compress the gas sufficiently\nthat large amounts of gas exceed the self shielding limit,\nthus enabling rapid formation of H2 . Gas obtains moderate\nH2 fractions immediately after compression. The maximum\nH2 fraction obtained then depends on the path of the gas\nthrough the shock. Gas which encounters little high density\nmaterial may obtain a fraction of 0.01 or so for a short period\n(10 \u2013 20 Myr) after which photodissociation reduces the H2\nfraction. On the other hand gas may encounter dense, cold\nmaterial, in which case it will undergo a stronger shock, be\nsubject to greater cooling and become predominantly molecular. The time for the transition to fractions of 0.5 or so\nis typically 10 to 20 Myr, although this is a strict upper\nlimit because our calculations cannot fully resolve internal\nturbulence and neglect self-gravity of the gas. True cloud\nformation timescales therefore will be considerably shorter.\nWithout stellar feedback however, this gas tends to remain\nat high densities, and therefore retain appreciable H2 fractions for substantially longer times (\u223c 40 Myr). We note the\ncloud formation time is generally not a well defined quantity, and suggest that determining the time from which gas\nenters a spiral arm, to the point at which it becomes observable (in CO), may be a more robust measure in future\ncalculations.\n\nfrom\nhttp://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/dprice/splash/\n(Price 2007).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nREFERENCES\n\nWe thank an anonymous referee for reviewing the paper.\nCLD also thanks Matthew Bate for assistance with numerical issues, and Jim Pringle for reading a draft of the paper.\nThis work, conducted as part of the award 'The formation of stars and planets: Radiation hydrodynamical and\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations' made under the European Heads of Research Councils and European Science\nFoundation EURYI (European Young Investigator) Awards\nscheme, was supported by funds from the Participating\nOrganisations of EURYI and the EC Sixth Framework\nProgramme.

The results for the 4 and 8 million\nparticle calculations are very similar, although some discrepancies arise, particularly regarding the amount of cold and\nmolecular gas, when there are only 1 million particles.\nOn global scales, there is barely any difference in the\nstructure of the disc for all the different resolution simulations. To highlight possible differences, Fig. A1 zooms in on\na section of the disc. The structure is very similar for the 4\nand 8 million particle calculations. For the 1 million particle simulation, there is slightly less structure both along the\nspiral arms, and in the interarm spurs, since the small scale\nstructure is not as well resolved.\nWe also compared the thermal distribution of the gas,\nand the amount of H2 formed at different resolutions. Figure A2 indicates that the thermal distribution is very similar at different resolutions. The distributions mainly differ\nat low temperatures where the cold, dense regions are not as\nwell resolved at lower resolutions. We compared the amount\nof molecular gas after 240 Myr in the 1, 4 and 8 million\nparticle simulations, finding that 12, 21 and 22 % of the gas\nin the disc is molecular. Thus with only 1 million particles\nthe amount of molecular gas is significantly underestimated.\nAgain the amount of molecular gas is similar in the 4 and 8\nmillion simulations, although the 22% for 8 million particles\nstill represents a lower limit.\n\nAllen R.
