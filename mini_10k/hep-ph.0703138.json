For a more comprehensive\nintroduction, the reader is referred to two recent review articles on this subject [1, 2].\n< 245 GeV at\nPrecision electroweak data prefer a light Higgs boson: mh \u223c\n95% c.l., assuming no other new physics [3]. A satisfactory theory of EWSB\nmust contain a mechanism to stabilize the Higgs mass against radiative corrections. One intriguing possibility is that the Higgs is a composite particle, a\nbound state of more fundamental constituents held together by a new strong\nforce [4]. This scenario relates the weak scale to the confinement scale of the\n1\n\n\fnew strong interactions, which is generated via dimensional transmutation\nand can be naturally hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale. However,\nsince precision electroweak data rule out new strong interactions at scales below about 10 TeV, an additional mechanism is required to stabilize the \"little\nhierarchy\" between the Higgs mass and the strong interaction scale. In analogy with the pions of QCD, the lightness of the Higgs could be explained if\nit were a Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) corresponding to a spontaneously\nbroken global symmetry of the new strongly interacting sector. Gauge and\nYukawa couplings of the Higgs, as well as its self-coupling, must violate the\nglobal symmetry explicitly: an exact NGB only has derivative interactions.\nQuantum effects involving these interactions generate a mass term for the\nHiggs. In a generic model, the dominant effect comes from one-loop quadratically divergent part of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential, and its large\nsize makes the models phenomenologically unacceptable: either the Higgs\nis too heavy to fit the data, or the strong coupling scale is too low. Little\nHiggs models avoid this difficulty by incorporating the \"collective symmetry\nbreaking\"1 mechanism, which enforces the cancellation of the quadratically\ndivergent one-loop contributions to the Higgs mass, making a light composite\nHiggs compatible with the 10 TeV strong interaction scale. The cancellation\nis due to a set of new TeV-scale particles (typically gauge bosons and vectorlike quarks) predicted by the LH models. If these models are realized in\nnature, the LHC experiments should be able to discover these particles and\nstudy their properties extensively.\n\n2\n\nLittlest Higgs Model\n\nMany LH models have been proposed in the literature; as an example, let us\nbriefly review the \"Littlest Higgs\" model [7], which provides one of the most\neconomical implementations of the idea and forms the basis for most phenomenological analyses. Consider a model with an SU(5) global symmetry,\nspontaneously broken down to an SO(5) subgroup, at a scale f \u223c 1 TeV, by\n1\n\nThe collective symmetry breaking mechanism was first gleaned by Arkani-Hamed,\nCohen and Georgi [5] from a study of five-dimensional theories through the application of\nthe dimensional deconstruction approach [6].\n\n2\n\n\fa vacuum condensate in the symmetric tensor representation:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 0 11\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03a30 = \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 ,\n11 0 0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere 11 is a 2\u00d72 identity matrix. The model contains 14 massless NGB fields\n\u03c0 a , one for each broken generator X a . At energy scales below \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f ,\nthe NGB interactions are independent of the details of the physics giving\nrise to the condensate and can be described by an SU(5)/SO(5) non-linear\nsigma model (nl\u03c3m), in terms of the sigma field \u03a3(x) = e2i\u03a0/f \u03a30 , where\nP\n\u03a0 = a \u03c0 a (x)X a . An [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 subgroup of the SU(5) is weakly\ngauged. The gauged generators are embedded in such a way that gauging\neach SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) factor leaves an SU(3) subgroup of the global symmetry\nunbroken:\n0 0\n0\n\u03c3 a /2 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0\n0 0 \uf8f7\nQa2 = \uf8ed 0 0\nQa1 = \uf8ed 0\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8f8,\na\u2217\n0 0 \u2212\u03c3 /2\n0\n0 0\nY1 = diag(3, 3, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122)/10 , Y2 = diag(2, 2, 2, \u22123, \u22123)/10 .\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(2)\n\nAt the scale f , the condensate \u03a30 breaks the full gauge group down to the\ndiagonal SU(2)\u00d7U(1), identified with the SM electroweak group. Four gauge\nbosons, WH\u00b1 , WH3 and BH , acquire TeV-scale masses by absorbing four of the\nNGB fields. The remaining NGBs decompose into a weak doublet, identified\nwith the SM Higgs H, and a weak triplet \u03a6:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2217 H \u03a6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03a0 = \uf8ed H\u2020 \u2217 HT \uf8f8 ,\n\u03a6 H\u2217 \u2217\n\n(3)\n\nwhere asterisks denote eaten fields. At the quantum level, gauge interactions\ninduce a Coleman-Weinberg potential for the NGBs. However, the Higgs\nis embedded in such a way that the subset of global symmetries preserved\nby each SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge factor would be sufficient to ensure the exact\nvanishing of its potential. Both gauge factors, acting collectively, are needed\nto break enough symmetry to induce a non-zero CW potential for H: any\ndiagram contributing to this potential must involve at least one power of a\ngauge coupling from each factor. One loop diagrams satisfying this criterion\n3\n\n\fare at most logarithmically divergent; the usual one-loop quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass does not appear. The same collective symmetry\nbreaking approach can be used to eliminate the large contribution to the\nHiggs mass from the top quark loops: the top Yukawa arises from two terms\nin the Lagrangian, each of which by itself preserves enough global symmetry to keep the Higgs exactly massless. Implementing this idea requires the\nintroduction of a new vector-like fermion, the T quark, with mass mT \u223c f\nand the quantum numbers of the SM tR . It is interesting that, in contrast to\nSUSY, the cancellations in the LH model involve particles of the same spin:\nthe divergence due to the SM top loop is cancelled by T loops, while the\ndivergence due to the SM gauge bosons is cancelled by the loops of WH and\nBH . The leading contribution to the CW potential from top loops has the\nform\n\u03bb2 m2\n\u039b2\nm2h = \u22123 t 2T log 2 ,\n(4)\n8\u03c0\nmT\nand has the correct sign to trigger EWSB. The contributions from gauge and\nscalar loops have the opposite sign, but are typically smaller than (4) due\nto the large top Yukawa; the two-loop contributions are subdominant. The\ntriplet \u03a6 is not protected by the collective symmetry breaking mechanism,\nand acquires a TeV-scale mass at one loop. An order-one Higgs quartic\ncoupling is also generated, both by quadratically divergent one-loop diagrams\nand by tree-level exchanges of the triplet \u03a6 arising from the H \u2020 \u03a6H vertex\npresent in the one-loop CW potential. Thus, the model provides an attractive\npicture of radiative EWSB, with the required hierarchies v \u223c f /(4\u03c0) \u223c\n\u039b/(4\u03c0)2 emerging naturally.\nThe Littlest Higgs model is remarkably predictive, describing the TeVscale new physics with only a small number of free parameters. The model\ncontains two SU(2) gauge couplings, two U(1) couplings, and two couplings\nin the top Yukawa sector; however, in each case, one combination of the two\nis fixed by the requirement to reproduce the SM g, g \u2032 , and yt . This leaves\nthree independent parameters; it is convenient to use three mixing angles, \u03c8,\n\u03c8 \u2032 , and \u03b1, respectively. These angles, along with the scale f , determine the\nmasses and couplings of the new states; for example,\n\u221a\ng\ng\u2032\n2\u03bbt\nM(WH ) =\nf , M(T ) =\nf , M(BH ) = \u221a\nf. (5)\n\u2032\nsin 2\u03c8\nsin 2\u03b1\n5 sin 2\u03c8\nTwo additional parameters, coefficients a and a\u2032 from the quadratically divergent part of the one-loop CW potential, are required to describe the weak\n4\n\n\ftriplet sector.\nThe new particles at the TeV scale introduced by the Littlest Higgs model\naffect precision electroweak observables, and their properties are constrained\nby data. These constraints have been worked out in detail in Refs. [8, 9].\nUnfortunately, it was found that the simplest version of the model outlined\nabove is strongly disfavored by data: the symmetry breaking scale is bounded\nby f > 4 TeV at 95% c.l. in the \"best-case\" scenario, and the bound is even\nstronger for generic parameters. Such a high f would require a substantial amount of fine tuning to maintain the lightness of the Higgs, largely\ndestroying the original motivation for the Littlest Higgs model. The corrections to observables are predominantly generated by the tree-level exchanges\nof heavy gauge bosons and the non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev) of\nthe weak triplet \u03a6; both these effects violate the custodial SU(2) symmetry.\nThe gauge boson contribution is dominated by the BH , whose mass is typically well below the scale f , see Eq. (5). The simplest way to alleviate the\nsituation is to reduce the gauge group to SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)Y , abandoning the collective symmetry breaking mechanism in the U(1) sector. This\neliminates the BH boson, and consistent fits for f as low as 1 TeV can be\nobtained [10, 11], albeit only in a rather small region of the parameter space\nas shown in Fig. 1. Due to the small value of the SM U(1)Y coupling, the uncanceled contribution to the Higgs mass from this sector does not introduce\nsignificant fine tuning. While technically natural, this model seems rather\nunattractive from the theoretical point of view.\n\n3\n\nLittlest Higgs with T Parity\n\nA more elegant solution to the precision electroweak woes of the Littlest Higgs\nmodel has been proposed by Cheng and Low [12]. They enlarge the symmetry structure of the models by introducing an additional discrete symmetry,\ndubbed \"T parity\" in analogy to R parity in the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (MSSM). T parity can be implemented in any LH model\nbased on a product gauge group, including the Littlest Higgs [13, 14]. The\ngauge and higgs sector of the Littlest Higgs model with T parity (LHT) are\nidentical to the Littlest Higgs model described above, with the additional\nrestrictions \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c0/4. (The action of the T parity on the gauge sector\nsimply interchanges the two SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) factors, enforcing the equality of\nthe gauge couplings.) The SM gauge bosons are T-even, while their heavy\n5\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\n6\na\n4\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nc\n\nFigure 1: Contour plot of the allowed values of f in the SU(5)/SO(5) Littlest\nHiggs model with an SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauged subgroup, as a function\nof the parameters c \u2261 cos \u03b8 and a. The gray shaded region at the bottom is\nexcluded by requiring a positive triplet mass. From Ref. [10].\n\ncounterparts WH and BH are T-odd. Likewise, the SM Higgs boson is Teven, while the additional weak-triplet scalar is T-odd. In the fermion sector,\nthe parity is implemented in such a way that all the SM fermions are T-even.\nConsistency requires an introduction of a vector-like T-odd partner for each\nweak doublet fermion of the SM: T-odd quarks Q\u0303ai are the partners of the\nquark doublets Qai (here a = 1 . . . 3 is the color index, while i = 1 . . . 3 is\nthe generation index), while the T-odd leptons L\u0303i are the partners of the SM\nlepton doublets Li . In the top sector, the T quark of the Littlest Higgs model\nis T even, and an additional T-odd top partner T\u2212 has to be introduced for\nconsistency.\nFrom these assignments, it is easy to see that the T parity explicitly\nforbids any tree-level contribution from the heavy gauge bosons to the observables involving only SM particles as external states, as well as the H \u2020 \u03a6H\ncoupling in the effective CW potential which induced the triplet vev in the\noriginal Littlest Higgs model. Thus the leading, tree-level corrections to pre6\n\n\f2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\nR\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n500\n\n750\n\n1000\n\n1250\n\n1500\n\n1750\n\n2000\n\nf (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: Exclusion contours in terms of the parameter R \u2261 tan \u03b1 and the\nsymmetry breaking scale f in the LHT model. The contribution of the Todd fermions to the T parameter is neglected. From lightest to darkest, the\ncontours correspond to the 95, 99, and 99.9 confidence level exclusion. From\nRef. [15].\ncision electroweak observables in the Littlest Higgs model are eliminated. In\nfact, T parity guarantees that corrections to all observables involving only\nthe SM external states are generated exclusively at loop level.2 A detailed\nanalysis of precision electroweak constraints on the LHT model at the oneloop level has been performed in Ref. [15]. It was found that values of f\nas low as 500 GeV are allowed, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In addition, experimental constraints on the coefficients of four-fermion operators such as \u0113e\u016bu\nplace an upper bound on the mass of the T-odd quark and lepton partners.\nAssuming a common mass scale M\u0303 for all partners, Ref. [15] obtained\nM\u0303\nf\n< 4.8\n1 TeV\n1 TeV\n2\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThe only exception occurs in the top sector, where the SM top quark and the T mix\nat the tree level resulting to deviations of the top couplings from their SM values. At\npresent, this does not constrain the model, due to the limited experimental precision on\nobservables involving the top quark. However, these effects are likely to become observable\nat the LHC and the ILC [16].\n\n7\n\n\fIn analogy to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) of SUSY models with R parity, the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) of the LHT model is\nstable. Typically, the LTP is the BH gauge boson, frequently referred \u221a\nto as\n\u2032\nthe \"heavy photon\". Indeed, this particle is quite light, M(BH ) = g f / 5 \u2248\n0.16f . Since the BH is weakly interacting, it provides a potential dark matter\ncandidate. The relic abundance of the heavy photon has been computed in\nRefs. [14, 17]; the most complete calculation to date, which included coannihilation effects, was recently presented in Ref. [18]. Regions of parameter space\nwhere the relic photon has the correct density to account for the observed\ndark matter have been mapped out; see, for example, Fig. 3. As expected,\nthe correct relic density can be obtained for reasonable values of the model\nparameters, consistent with naturalness and other constraints. Prospects for\ndirect detection of the heavy photon dark matter have been evaluated in\nRef. [18]; unfortunately the rates are quite low and a factor of 103 improvement of the current sensitivity of the CDMS experiment is required before\nthe interesting regions of the parameter space can be probed. Indirect detection via anomalous high-energy positrons [17] and gamma rays [18] arising\nfrom the pair-annihilation of galactic LTPs provides a more promising detection avenue, with observable signals expected at the PAMELA, AMS-02,\nand GLAST experiments.\nA first study of the collider phenomenology of the Littlest Higgs model\nwith T parity was presented in Ref. [14]. Most signatures are characterized by\nlarge missing energy or transverse momentum carried away by the two LTPs.\nIn this sense, the signatures are very similar to SUSY models with conserved\nR parity or UED models with conserved Kaluza-Klein parity, raising an interesting question of how these models can be distinguished experimentally\nat the LHC and the ILC. This question deserves future study. In addition,\nthe T-even heavy top T+ can be produced singly. The phenomenology of this\nparticle has been studied extensively in the context of the original Littlest\nHiggs [19, 11]. A detector-level study by the ATLAS collaboration [20] concluded that the discovery reach for the T+ at the LHC is about 2 TeV. In\nthe model with T parity, the T+ may acquire additional decay channels [14];\nhowever, for generic parameters, the analyses performed in [19, 11, 20] are\nstill applicable.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 3: The contours of constant present abundance of the heavy photon\nLTP, \u03a9LTP h2 , in the M \u2212 M\u0303 plane, where M is the LTP mass and M\u0303 is the\ncommon mass scale of the T-odd quark and lepton partners. The Higgs mass\nis taken to be 300 GeV (left panel) and 120 GeV (right panel). The red and\ngreen contours correspond to the upper and lower bounds from the first-year\nWMAP data, assuming that the LTP makes up all of dark matter. The yellow\nand blue lines correspond to the LTP contributing 50% and 70%, respectively,\nof the measured dark matter density. The shaded region corresponds to a\ncharged and/or colored LTP. From Ref. [18].\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this contribution, we have briefly reviewed the Little Higgs models, which\nprovide an attractive scenario combining dynamical stabilization of the weakPlanck hierarchy by dimensional transmutation with the radiative EWSB.\nWe concentrated on the Littlest Higgs model; for a review of many other\nLH models in the literature, the interested reader is referred to the review\narticles [1, 2]. The version of the model incorporating T parity provides\nacceptable fits to precision electroweak data without significant fine tuning.\nThe model contains an interesting and phenomenologically successful dark\nmatter candidate, the lightest T-odd particle (LTP). It makes interesting\npredictions which can be tested at the LHC. More work is required in order\n9\n\n\fto ensure that the LHC experiments maximize their potential in searching\nfor the predicted signatures; to this end, it would be useful to systematically\nincorporate the LH model into the standard Monte Carlo packages such as\nMadGRAPH.\nAcknowledgment - This research is supported by the National Science\nFoundation grant PHY-0355005.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
