Let\nGm,n denote the set of m-dimensional subspaces of Cn : then a code is a finite\nsubset of Gm,n in which few distances occur, while a design is a finite subset\nof Gm,n that polynomially approximates the entire set.

These results are motivated by the bounds for real\nsubspaces recently found by Bachoc, Coulangeon and Nebe, and the bounds\ngeneralize those of Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel for codes and designs on the\ncomplex unit sphere.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of complex Grassmannian codes and\ndesigns: codes and designs in the collection of fixed-rank subspaces of a complex\nvector space.\nIn the 1970's, Delsarte [10] developed a series of excellent bounds for certain\nerror-correcting codes by treating codewords as points in an association scheme\nand then applying linear programming. Shortly thereafter, Delsarte, Goethals\nand Seidel [11] showed that the same technique could also be used on systems\nof points on the real or complex unit sphere, which they called spherical codes\n\u2217\n\nemail:aroy@qis.ucalgary.ca\n\n1\n\n\fand spherical designs; this resulted in important contributions to problems in\nsphere-packing [9, Chapter 9]. This linear programming technique, which is\nnow known as \"Delsarte LP theory\", has proved surprisingly portable. Recently, Bachoc, Coulangeon and Nebe [3] generalized the results of Delsarte,\nGoethals and Seidel to real Grassmannian spaces, and Bachoc [2] pointed out\nthat \"the same game\" can be played over the complex numbers. In this paper,\nwe investigate more closely the case of complex Grassmannian codes.\nThe motivation for studying complex Grassmannians comes from the theory of quantum measurements. Roughly speaking, any complex Grassmannian\n1-design defines a projective measurement in the theory of quantum mechanics.\nIt has recently been discovered that complex projective 2-designs correspond\nto quantum measurements that are optimal for the purposes of nonadaptive\nquantum state tomography [21]. In fact, this is also true in the more general Grassmannian setting: complex Grassmannian 2-designs are the optimal\nchoices of measurements for nonadaptive quantum state tomography when the\nobserver only has access to measurements with a restricted number of outcomes.\nMore details will appear in a paper by Godsil, R\u00f6tteler, and the author [13].\nComplex Grassmannians also play a role in certain wireless communication\nprotocols [1].\nDefine Gm,n to be the set of m-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional\ncomplex vector space. Without loss of generality, we will always assume m \u2264\nn/2. Usually, we will represent a subspace a by its n \u00d7 n projection matrix Pa .\nThe inner product on Gm,n is the trace inner product for projection matrices:\nha, bi := tr(Pa\u2217 Pb )\n= tr(Pa Pb ).\n\nSince ha, bi = hb, ai, the inner product is real. This is a measure of separation,\nor distance, between two subspaces-note that is not a distance metric per se:\nthe inner product of Pa with itself is maximal rather than minimal. However,\nthe chordal distance [8], defined by\np\ndc (Pa , Pb ) := m \u2212 tr(Pa Pb ),\n\nis a monotonic function of the inner product. Given a finite set of inner product\nvalues A, an A-code is a subset S of Gm,n such that\nA = {tr(Pa Pb ) : a, b \u2208 S, a 6= b}.\n\nAn s-distance set is an A-code with |A| = s. This generalizes the concept of\nan s-distance set on the complex unit sphere: if u and v are unit vectors, then\n\n2\n\n\ftheir separation distance on the unit sphere is a function of\n|u\u2217 v|2 = tr(uu\u2217 vv \u2217 ).\nWe are interested in codes of maximal size for a fixed A or s, and bounds on\ntheir size based on zonal polynomials. Table 1 in Section 6 gives a summary of\nthe bounds for small |A|.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the orbits\nof pairs of subspaces in Gm,n under the action of U (n): these orbits play a\nsignificant role in the bounds derived later on. In Sections 3, 4 and 5, we develop\nthe necessary representation theory background needed for our LP bounds.\nIn particular, we discuss the decomposition of the square-integrable functions\non Gm,n into irreducible representations of U (d), and the zonal polynomials\nfor these representations. The results in this section are all known, and the\ndevelopment is quite similar to that of Bachoc, Coulangeon and Nebe for real\nGrassmannians. In fact, the complex case is actually easier than the real case,\nbecause representations of the unitary group U (n) are easier to describe than\nrepresentations of the orthogonal group O(n). In Section 6, we develop absolute\nand relative bounds for codes, and show how these bounds for Gm,n reduce to\nknown bounds for complex spherical codes when m = 1. These bounds are\ncompared to some other known bounds for subspaces in Section 7. In Section 9,\nwe consider Grassmanian designs. Grassmannian codes enjoy a form of duality\nwith complex Grassmannian designs, very similar to real Grassmannian codes\nor spherical codes. In Section 8, we give examples in which the bounds are\ntight. In many cases codes of maximal size or designs of minimal size have the\nstructure of an association scheme, which we describe in Section 10.\n\n2\n\nOrbitals\n\nIn this section we describe the orbits of pairs of elements of Gm,n under the\naction of U (n).\nFirst, we claim that Gm,n can be identified with a factor group of the unitary\ngroup, U (n)/(U (m) \u00d7 U (n \u2212 m)). For, consider the first m columns of a matrix\nof U (n) as the basis for a subspace a of dimension m in Cn , letting the last\nn \u2212 m columns be a basis for a\u22a5 . Then a is invariant under the action of U (m)\non the first m columns, while a\u22a5 is invariant under U (n \u2212 m).\nAs a result of this factor group, U (n) acts on Gm,n as follows: if U is in\nU (n) and Pa is the projection matrix for a \u2208 Gm,n , then\nU : Pa 7\u2192 U Pa U \u2217 .\n\n3\n\n\fThis action is an isometry, in that it preserves the trace inner product on Gm,n .\nUnlike the complex unit sphere, however, U (n) is not 2-homogeneous on Gm,n :\nU (n) does not act transitively on pairs of subspaces with the same distance. In\nother words, the fact that tr(Pa Pb ) = tr(Pc Pd ) does not imply that there is a\nunitary matrix mapping a to c and b to d. In order to use zonal polynomials,\nwe need to understand the orbits of pairs in Gm,n under this isometry group,\nwhich requires principal angles.\nGiven a and b in Gm,n , the principal angles \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8m between a and b are\ndefined as follows: firstly, \u03b81 is the largest angle that occurs between any two\nunit vectors a1 \u2208 a and b1 \u2208 b:\n\u03b81 := min arccos |a\u22171 b1 | .\na1 \u2208a\nb1 \u2208b\n\nSecondly, \u03b82 is the largest angle that occurs between any two unit vectors\n\u22a5\na2 \u2208 a \u2229 a\u22a5\n1 and b2 \u2208 b \u2229 b1 . Similarly define \u03b83 , . . . , \u03b8m . These principle angles\nare closely related to the eigenvalues of Pa Pb : the first m eigenvalues of Pa Pb are\n{cos2 \u03b81 , . . . , cos2 \u03b8m }. Because of this correspondence, for the remainder of this\npaper we simply refer to the eigenvalues yi := cos2 \u03b8i (rather than the values\n\u03b8i ) as the principal angles between a and b. Note that n \u2212 m of the eigenvalues\nof Pa Pb are zero, so we need only consider the first m eigenvalues. Conway,\nHardin, and Sloane [8] accredit the following lemma to Wong [24, Theorem 2].\nLemma 2.1. The principal angles characterize the orbits of pairs of subspaces\nunder U (n).\nProof. Suppose U \u2208 U (n) maps projection matrices Pa and Pb to Pc and Pd\nrespectively. Then by similarity, the eigenvalues of\nPc Pd = (U Pa U \u2217 )(U Pb U \u2217 ) = U Pa Pb U \u2217\nare the same as the eigenvalues of Pa Pb .\nConversely, we show that if Pa Pb and Pc Pd have the same eigenvalues, then\nsome unitary matrix U maps a to c and b to d. We do this by unitarily mapping\na and b into a canonical form that depends only on the eigenvalues of Pa Pb .\nLet Ma be an n \u00d7 m matrix whose columns [a1 , . . . , am ] are an orthonormal basis for a, so that Ma Ma\u2217 = Pa and Ma\u2217 Ma = I. Similarly define\nMb = [b1 , . . . , bm ] for b. Suppose Ma\u2217 Mb has singular value decomposition\nU DV \u2217 , where U and V are m \u00d7 m unitary and D is m \u00d7 m diagonal. Then\n(Ma U )\u2217 (Mb V ) = D. Since the columns of Ma U are another orthonormal basis\nfor a, without loss of generality we replace Ma by Ma U and likewise replace\n\n4\n\n\fMb with Mb V . In other words, we may assume without loss of generality that\nMa\u2217 Mb = D, where D is a diagonal matrix of singular values.\nNext, define the columns of Na = [am+1 , . . . , an ] to be any orthonormal\nbasis for a\u22a5 , so that Na Na\u2217 = I \u2212 Pa and Na\u2217 Na = I. Further assume that\nNa\u2217 Mb = QR, where Q is (n \u2212 m) \u00d7 (n \u2212 m) unitary and R is (n \u2212 m) \u00d7 m\nupper triangular (the QR-decomposition of Na\u2217 Mb ). Then Q\u2217 Na\u2217 Mb = R, and\nthe columns of Na Q form another orthonormal basis for a\u22a5 . Replacing Na by\n\u2217\nNa Q, we may assume\u0010without\n\u0011 loss of generality that Na Mb is upper triangular.\n\u2217\nM\nFinally, let Ua := N a\u2217 ; this is an n \u00d7 n unitary matrix. Then\na\n\nUa Ma =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nIm\n;\n0\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nD\nUa Mb =\n.\nR\n\nIf Pa Pb has eigenvalues cos2 \u03b8i , then Ma\u2217 Mb = D has singular values cos \u03b8i .\nMoreover, since Ua Mb has orthonormal columns, it follows that R also has\northogonal columns. We may therefore assume that R is not just the upper\ntriangular but diagonal, with diagonal entries sin \u03b8i . Thus Ua is a unitary\nmatrix which maps Ma and Mb into the form\n\nMa 7\u2192\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nIm\n,\n0\n\n\uf8eb\ncos \u03b81\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nMb 7\u2192 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec sin \u03b81\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n..\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\ncos \u03b8m \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8f7\nsin \u03b8m \uf8f8\n.\n\n0\n\nSince any pair (Ma , Mb ) with principal angles cos2 \u03b8i can be mapped to this\ncanonical form, it follows that the eigenvalues of Pa Pb characterize the orbits\nof pairs (a, b) under the unitary group.\n\n3\n\nRepresentations\n\nIn this section and the next, we develop the representation theory needed for\nGrassmannian LP bounds.\nAs is standard for compact Lie groups, we work with functions on Gm,n to\nfind irreducible representations. Define an inner product for functions on Gm,n\n\n5\n\n\fas follows:\nhf, gi :=\n\nZ\n\nf (a)g(a) da.\n\nGm,n\n\nR\nHere da is the unique measure invariant on Gm,n , normalized so that da = 1.\nThat such a measure exists an is unique (the Haar measure) follows from the\nfact that Gm,n is a compact Lie group. Equivalently, we may write\nZ\nhf, gi :=\nf (U \u2217 Pa U )g(U \u2217 Pa U ) dU,\nU (n)\n\nwhere dU is the Haar measure on U (n), and Pa is the projection matrix for\nsome fixed a \u2208 Gm,n . Now let L2 (Gm,n ) denote the space of square-integrable\nfunctions on Gm,n . Then U (n) acts on f \u2208 Gm,n as follows:\n(U f )(Pa ) := f (U \u2217 Pa U ).\nIt follows that L2 (Gm,n ) provides a representation of U (n). As we will see, this\nrepresentation can be decomposed into irreducible subrepresentations explicity,\nand the decomposition is multiplicity-free: no irreducible representation of U (n)\noccurs more than once in L2 (Gm,n ).\nSince U (n) is a compact Lie group, its irreducible representations are wellstudied: see for example [22, 15, 6, 12]. Every irreducible representation is\nindexed by a dominant weight [22, Theorem 7.34]. In the case of U (n), we may\ntake these weights to have the form [6, Theorem 38.3]\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) : \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03bbn , \u03bbi \u2208 Z.\nThe dimension of the irreducible representation V\u03bb indexed by \u03bb is given by\nWeyl's character formula [22, Theorem 7.32]. In the case of U (n), the formula\nreduces to:\nY \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj + j \u2212 i\n.\n(3.1)\ndim V\u03bb =\nj \u2212i\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nFor example, the standard representation of U (n) is indexed by \u03bb = (1, 0, . . . , 0),\nwhich gives\ndim V(1,0,...,0) = n.\nNote that there is more than one irreducible representation with the same\ndimension.\nEach dominant weight may also be thought of as a form acting on a maximal\nAbelian subgroup of the Lie group. Here \u03bb acts on the diagonal matrix d =\n\n6\n\n\fdiag(d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 U (n) as follows:\nd\u03bb :=\n\nn\nY\n\nd\u03bbi i .\n\ni=1\n\nThe next section describes exactly which of these forms contribute to the decomposition of L2 (Gm,n ).\n\n4\n\nSymmetric spaces\n\nThe group U (n)/U (m) \u00d7 U (n \u2212 m) is an example of a symmetric space: a\nfactor group G/K such that G is a connected semisimple Lie group and K is\nthe fixed point set of an involutive automorphism of G. In this section, we use\nresults from Goodman and Wallach [15] to explain how the decomposition of\nrepresentations of Gm,n follows from this structure.\nLet sm denote the m \u00d7 m matrix with backwards diagonal entries of 1 and\n0 elsewhere:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nsm := \uf8ed . . . \uf8f8 .\n1\n\n0\n\nThen U (n, sn ) denotes the group of matrices which preserve the Hermitian\nform (x, y) 7\u2192 x\u2217 sn y: that is, U (n, sn ) is the set of matrices M such that\nM \u2217 sn M = sn . This group is isomorphic the standard unitary group U (n).\nDefine\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nsm\n\uf8f8,\nIn\u22122m\nJm,n := \uf8ed\nsm\nand consider the involution \u03b8(M ) := Jm,n M Jm,n on GLn (C). The fixed points\nof \u03b8 have the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na\nb\nc\nM =\uf8ed d\ne\ndsm \uf8f8 ,\nsm csm sm b sm asm\nso the fixed point set in GLn (C) is isomorphic to GLm (C) \u00d7 GLn\u2212m (C).\n\nLemma 4.1. The fixed point set K of \u03b8 in G = U (n, sn ) is isomorphic to\nU (m) \u00d7 U (n \u2212 m). Therefore Gm,n is a symmetric space.\nProof. For a = (a1 , . . . , am ), let \u0103 denote the reversal of a, namely\n\u0103 := sm a = (am , . . . , a1 ).\n\n7\n\n\fIf a, b, and c have length m, n \u2212 2m and m respectively, then we have\nJm,n (a, b, c)T = (c\u0306, b, \u0103)T . Therefore the 1 and \u22121 eigenspaces of Jm,n are\nV+ = {(a, b, \u0103)} and V\u2212 = {(a, 0, \u2212\u0103)} respectively. These spaces are orthogonal with respect to the form (x, y) 7\u2192 x\u2217 sn y.\nNow K is the set of points in U (n, sn ) which commute with Jm,n . So\ndecomposing Cn into V+ \u2295 V\u2212 , we have that K is the set of points in U (n, sn )\nwhich leave both V+ and V\u2212 invariant. In other words, K is the set of points\nwhich preserve the form sn on the subspaces V+ and V\u2212 . Thus\nK\u223c\n= U (V+ , sn |V+ ) \u00d7 U (V\u2212 , sn |V\u2212 ) \u223c\n= U (n \u2212 m) \u00d7 U (m).\nThe fact that K is the fixed point set of \u03b8 in G implies ([15, Theorem 12.3.5])\nthat (G, K) is a spherical pair: for every irreducible representation V\u03bb of G, the\nsubspace V\u03bbK of points fixed by K satisfies dim V\u03bbK \u2264 1. Those representations\nsuch that V\u03bbK has dimension exactly 1 are called spherical representations. The\nfollowing theorem [16, Theorem V.4.3] explains how those representation relate\nto L2 (G/K).\nTheorem 4.2. Let G be a compact simply connected semisimple Lie group,\nand let K \u2264 G be the fixed point group of an involutive automorphism of G.\nFurther let \u011cK denote the set of equivalence classes of spherical representations\nV\u03bb of G with respect to K. Then L2 (G/K) is a multiplicity-free representation\nof G, and\nM\nV\u03bb .\nL2 (G/K) \u223c\n=\n\u03bb\u2208\u011cK\n\nTo describe which representations are spherical, we now consider diagonal\nsubgroups of G and K. For d = (d1 , . . . , dn ), let diag(d) denote the diagonal\nmatrix with diagonal entries d1 , . . . , dn . Firstly, note that diag(d) is in U (n, sn )\nif and only if dn+1\u2212k = 1/d \u0304k , where d \u0304k is the complex conjugate of dk . In other\nwords, if d \u0304\u22121 denotes the vector (1/d \u03041 , . . . , 1/d \u0304k ), then diag(d) is in U (n, sn ) if\nand only if d \u0306 = d \u0304\u22121 . Secondly, note that if d = diag(a, b, c) with a and c of\nlength m, then \u03b8(d) = (c\u0306, b, \u0103). It follows that the diagonal group\nT := {diag(a1 , . . . , am , cm+1 , . . . , cn\u2212m , am , . . . , a1 ) : |ai | = 1, c\u0306 = c\u0304 \u22121 }\nis contained in K. In fact, it is a maximal Abelian subgroup of K: this is called\na torus of K.\nRecall that the irreducible representations of G are indexed by the dominant\nweights \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ), where \u03bbi \u2265 \u03bbi+1 and \u03bbi \u2208 Z. Now the spherical\nrepresentations of G with respect to K are indexed by those particular dominant\n\n8\n\n\fweights such that t\u03bb = 1 for all t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) in the torus T (see Goodman\nand Wallach [15, p. 540]). So a dominant weight \u03bb is spherical if it has the\nform\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbm , 0, . . . , 0, \u2212\u03bbm , . . . , \u2212\u03bb1 )\nwith \u03bb1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03bbm \u2265 0 and \u03bbi \u2208 Z. In other words:\nTheorem 4.3. The irreducible representations of U (n) occurring in L2 (Gm,n )\nare in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions with at most m\nparts.\nFor any partition \u03bc, we let H\u03bc (n), or simply H\u03bc , denote the irreducible\nrepresentation in L2 (Gm,n ) isomorphic to V(\u03bc,0,...,0,\u2212\u03bc\u0306) . The Weyl character\nformula (equation (3.1)) now tells us the dimension of each H\u03bc . The first few\ndimensions are:\ndim H(0) = dim V(0,...,0) = 1\ndim H(1) = dim V(1,0,...,0,\u22121) = n2 \u2212 1\n\nn2 (n \u2212 1)(n + 3)\n4\nn2 (n + 1)(n \u2212 3)\ndim H(1,1) =\n4\n(n2 \u2212 1)2 (n2 \u2212 9)\ndim H(2,1) =\n9\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn + k \u2212 2 2 n + 2k \u2212 1\ndim H(k) =\nn\u22121\nk\n\u0012\n\u00132\nn + 1 n \u2212 2k + 1\ndim H(1,...,1) =\nk\nn+1\n|{z}\ndim H(2) =\n\nk\n\nIf m = 1, then Gm,n is the complex projective space CP n\u22121 , and only the\nspaces H(k) occur. In that case H(k) is isomorphic to the space Harm(k, k) of\nharmonic polynomials of homogeneous degree k in both z and z\u0304, where z =\n(z1 , . . . , zn ) is a point on the unit sphere in Cn . Those harmonic polynomials\nwere used by Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel in their LP bounds for codes and\ndesigns the complex unit sphere [11].\nWe now record a few more representations of U (n) we will need later. Given\nan nonincreasing sequence of nonnegative integers \u03bc = (\u03bc1P\n, \u03bc2 , . . .), we say \u03bc\nhas size k and write |\u03bc| = k if \u03bc is a partition of k; that is, i \u03bci = k. We also\nsay \u03bc has length l and write len(\u03bc) = l if \u03bc has l nonzero entries. For example,\n\n9\n\n\f(2, 1, 0, . . .) has size 3 and length 2. Then for fixed Gm,n , define Hk = Hk (m, n)\nas follows:\nM\nHk (m, n) :=\nH\u03bc (n).\n|\u03bc|\u2264k\nlen(\u03bc)\u2264m\n\nFor k > 0 this representation is reducible, and Hk\u22121 is contained in Hk . When\nm = 1, Hk is isomorphic to the space of homogeneous polynomials degree k in\nboth z and z\u0304 on the unit sphere in Cn . In the next section, we will see that\nHk is also the span of the degree-k symmetric polynomials on the principal\nangles between a \u2208 Gm,n and some fixed b \u2208 Gm,n . Moreover, if g and h are\npolynomials in Hk and Hk\u2032 respectively, then gh is in Hk+k\u2032 , and in fact Hk+k\u2032\nis spanned by polynomials of that form.\nWe also let Homk (n) \u2286 L2 (Gm,n ) denote the space of polynomials which are\nhomogeneous of degree k in the entries of Pa , where Pa is the projection matrix\nof a \u2208 Gm,n . Since the constant function Pa 7\u2192 tr(Pa ) = m is in Hom1 (n), it\nfollows that Homk\u22121 (n) can be embedded into Homk (n). Similarly for fixed b,\nthe distance function Pa 7\u2192 tr(Pa Pb ) is in Hom1 (n). The next section will also\nshow that Hk is a subspace of Homk .\nJames and Constantine [17] further investigated the irreducible subspaces\nof L2 (Gm,n ), finding zonal polynomials for each irreducible representation. We\ndescribe those results in the next section.\n\n5\n\nZonal polynomials\n\nA zonal polynomial at a point a \u2208 Gm,n is a function on points b \u2208 Gm,n which\ndepends only on the the principle angles between a and b. Given any univariate\npolynomial\nPf (x) of degree k, we define the zonal polynomial of f at b as follows:\nif f (x) = ki=0 fi xi , then\nfa (b) =\n\nk\nX\n\nfi tr(Pa Pb )i .\n\ni=0\n\nHere Pa and Pb are the projection matrices for a and b. As written, the zonal\npolynomial is not homogeneous, but by embedding the constant 1 into Hom1 (n)\nin the form tr(Pb )/m, the exponents in fa (b) may be \"pushed up\" and we may\nassume fa is in Homk (n). To see that fa (b) only depends on the principal angles\nbetween a and b, note that tr(Pa Pb ) is simply the sum of the principal angles.\nThere is another set of zonal polynomials that play a particular role in the\ntheory of Delsarte bounds. Let H\u03bc be an irreducible representation in L2 (Gm,n ).\n\n10\n\n\fThen for each a \u2208 Gm,n , define the zonal orthogonal polynomial Z\u03bc,a to be the\nunique element of H\u03bc such that for every p \u2208 H\u03bc ,\nhZ\u03bc,a , pi = p(a).\nThen zonal polynomials are invariant under the unitary group, in the following\nsense:\nZ\u03bc,b (a) = hU \u2217 Z\u03bc,a , U \u2217 Z\u03bc,b i = hZ\u03bc,U a , Z\u03bc,U b i = Z\u03bc,U b (U a).\nThe value of Z\u03bc,b (a) depends on the U (n)-orbit of (a, b) and therefore depends\non the principle angles of a and b. With this in mind we sometimes write\nZ\u03bc,a (b) = Z\u03bc (a, b) or Z\u03bc,a (b) = Z\u03bc (y1 , . . . , ym ), where (y1 , . . . , ym ) are the principal angles of a and b.\nSchur orthogonality [22, Theorem 3.3] for irreducible representations implies\nthat Z\u03bc,a and Z\u03bd,b are orthogonal for \u03bc 6= \u03bd. So, we have\nhZ\u03bc,a , Z\u03bd,b i = \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bd Z\u03bc (a, b).\nMoreover, Z\u03bc,a (b) = Z\u03bc,b (a) is in fact real and symmetric in a and b. The zonal\npolynomials satisfy some other important properties, including the following\npositivity condition:\nLemma 5.1. For any subset S \u2286 Gm,n ,\nX\nZ\u03bc (a, b) \u2265 0.\na,b\u2208S\n\nEquality holds only when\nProof. We have\nX\n\nP\n\na\u2208S\n\nZ\u03bc,a = 0.\n\nZ\u03bc (a, b) =\n\na,b\u2208S\n\nX\n\na,b\u2208S\n\n=\n\nhZ\u03bc,a , Z\u03bc,b i\n\n*\nX\n\nZ\u03bc,a ,\n\na\u2208S\n\n\u2265 0.\nEquality holds if and only if\n\nP\n\na\u2208S\n\nX\nb\u2208S\n\nZ\u03bc,b\n\n+\n\nZ\u03bc,a = 0.\n\nThe second important condition the zonal polynomials satisfy is called the\naddition formula:\n\n11\n\n\fLemma 5.2. Let e1 , . . . , eN be an orthonormal basis for the irreducible subspace H\u03bc . Then\nN\nX\nei (a)ei (b) = Z\u03bc (a, b).\ni=1\n\nProof.\nSince Z\u03bc,a is in H\u03bc , we may write it as a linear combination of\ne1 , . . . , eN :\nN\nX\n\nZ\u03bc,a =\n\ni=1\n\nX\n\n=\n\nhei , Z\u03bc,a i ei\nei (a)ei .\n\ni\n\nSo, it follows that Z\u03bc,a (b) =\n\nP\n\ni ei (a)ei (b).\n\nJames and Constantine give an explicit formula for the zonal orthogonal\npolynomials of Gm,n in terms of Schur polynomials, the irreducible characters\nof SL(m, C). If y = (y1 , . . . , ym ) are variables and \u03c3 = (s1 , . . . , sm ) is a partition\ninto at most m parts, then the (unnormalized) Schur polynomial is defined as\ns +m\u2212j\n\nX\u03c3 (y) :=\n\ndet(yi j\n\n)i,j\n.\nk\u2212j\ndet(yi )i,j\n\nEach Schur polynomial is a symmetric polynomial in (y1 , . . . , ym ). For more\ninformation about Schur polynomials, see Stanley [23, Chapter 7]. The normalized Schur polynomial X\u03c3\u2217 is the multiple of X\u03c3 such that X\u03c3\u2217 (1, . . . , 1) = 1.\nTo define the zonal orthogonal polynomials for Gm,n , first define the ascending product\n(a)s := a(a + 1) . . . (a + s \u2212 1),\nand given a partition \u03c3 = (s1 , . . . , sm ), define complex hypergeometric coefficients\nm\nY\n(a \u2212 i + 1)si .\n[a]\u03c3 :=\ni=1\n\nFurther assume we have a partial order \u2264 on partitions defined such that\n(s1 , . . . , sm ) \u2264 (k1 , . . . , kl ) if and only if si \u2264 ki for all i. Letting y + 1 :=\n(y1 + 1, . . . , ym + 1), the complex hypergeometric binomial coefficients [ \u03c3\u03ba ] are\ngiven by the formula\nX \u0014\u03ba \u0015\n\u2217\nX\u03c3\u2217 (y).\nX\u03ba (y + 1) =\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\u2264\u03ba\n\n12\n\n\fWe can now define the zonal orthogonal polynomials for Gm,n .

In this section, we find upper bounds on the size of an\nA-code in terms of either the cardinality of A or its elements. A summary of\nthe results for |A| \u2264 2 is given in Table 1.\nIf A = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k }, then the annihilator of A is the function\nannA (x) :=\n\nk\nY\n(x \u2212 \u03b1i ),\ni=1\n\n14\n\n\fThe significance of the annihilator is that annA (tr(Pa Pb )) = 0 for any a 6= b\nin S. More generally, for any polynomial f , an f -code is a collection S of\nsubspaces such that f (tr(Pa )) 6= 0 and f (tr(Pa Pb )) = 0 for every a 6= b in S. If\nA is any set of angles and f is the annihilator of A, then an A-code is also an\nf -code.\nTheorem 6.1. If S \u2286 Gm,n is an A-code, with |A| = k, then\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nn +k\u22121\n|S| \u2264 dim(Homk (n)) \u2264\n.\nk\nProof. We prove more generally that if S is an f -code, with deg(f ) = k, then\n|S| \u2264 dim(Homk (n)). The result then follows by taking f to be the annihilator\nof A.\nConsider the zonal polynomials fa (b) := f (tr(Pa Pb )), for a \u2208 S. Note that\nfa is in Homk (n), since fa (b) is a degree-k polynomial in the entries of Pb . Since\nfa (b) = 0 for every b \u2208 S except a, and fa (a) 6= 0, the set {fa : a \u2208 S} is linearly\nindependent. Thus the number of functions |S| is at most the dimension of the\nspace Homk (n).\nCorollary 6.2. Let S be a collection of subspaces in Gm,n such that tr(Pa Pb ) =\n\u03b1 for all a 6= b in S. Then\n|S| \u2264 n2 .\nProof. Use Theorem 6.1 with the degree-1 annihilator of \u03b1, which induces\nzonal polynomials in Hom1 (n).\nSince fa (b) is also a degree-k symmetric polynomial in the principal angles\nof a and b, it follows that fa is also in Hk (m, n). Then by the same argument\nas in Theorem 6.1, we have\nCorollary 6.3. If S \u2286 Gm,n is an A-code, with |A| = k, then\n|S| \u2264 dim(Hk (m, n)).\nIf equality holds, then the functions fa form a basis for the space. Moreover,\nthe space Hk (m, n) is exactly the space of functions on S.\nTheorem 6.1 and Corollary 6.3 are called absolute bounds for Grassmannian\ncodes, because the bounds depend only on the number of different inner product\nvalues that occur in S. When m = 1 these bounds reduce to the absolute\nbounds of Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel [11, Theorem 6.1]. There is also a\nrelative bound, which depends on the actual values of the inner products and\nis sometimes tighter.\n\n15\n\n\fTheorem 6.4.PLet f (y1 , . . . , ym ) \u2208 R[y1 , . . . , ym ] be a symmetric polynomial\nsuch that f = \u03bc c\u03bc Z\u03bc , where Z\u03bc is a zonal orthogonal polynomial, and each\nc\u03bc \u2265 0. Further assume that c0 is strictly positive. If S is a set of subspaces in\nGm,n such that fa (b) := f (y1 (a, b), . . . , ym (a, b)) is nonpositive for every a 6= b\nin S, then\nf (1, . . . , 1)\n.\n|S| \u2264\nc0\nProof.

For real Grassmannians, Conway, Hardin and Sloane [8] call these bounds the simplex and\northoplex bounds. Here we give their complex analogues.\nRecall that if Pa be the n \u00d7 n projection matrix for a \u2208 Gm,n , then Pa is\nHermitian with trace m, so Pa\u2032 = Pa \u2212 mI/n lies in a real space of dimension\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 2\n\u2212 m/n), so Pa\u2032 is embedded onto\nn2 \u2212 1. Moreover ||P\npa || := tr(Pa Pa ) = nm(1\n2 \u22121\n. Further recall that the chordal\na sphere of radius m(1 \u2212 m/n) in R\ndistance on Gm,n is defined by\ndc (a, b)2 = m \u2212 tr(Pa Pb )\n1\n1\n= ||Pa \u2212 Pb ||2 = ||Pa\u2032 \u2212 Pb\u2032 ||2 .\n2\n2\n2\n\nWith this distance, the Grassmannians are isometrically embedded into Rn \u22121 .\nThe \"Rankin bounds\" given in Theorem 7.1 below (see [4, Theorems 6.1.1 &\n6.1.2]) are bounds on the minimum distance between points on a real sphere\nas a function of the number of points and the dimension of the space. An\nequatorial simplex refers to a set of N points on the unit sphere that form a\nsimplex in a hyperplane of dimension N \u2212 1.\nTheorem 7.1. Given N points on a sphere of radius r in RD , the minimum\ndistance d between any two points satisfies\nr\n2N\n.\nd\u2264r\nN \u22121\nEquality requires N \u2264 D + 1 and occurs if and only if the points form a regular\nequatorial simplex. For N > D + 1, the minimum distance satisfies\n\u221a\nd \u2264 r 2,\nand equality requires N \u2264 2D. When N = 2D, equality occurs if and only if\nthe points are the vertices of a regular orthoplex.\nConway, Hardin and Sloane [8] apply these bounds to get the simplex and\northoplex bounds for real Grassmannians: we can do the same for the complex\nGrassmannians.\n\n18\n\n\fCorollary 7.2. Given a set S points in Gm,n , the largest inner product value\n\u03b1 = ha, bi between any two points satisfies\n\u03b1\u2265m\n\nm|S| \u2212 n\n.\nn|S| \u2212 n\n\n(7.1)\n\nEquality requires |S| \u2264 n2 and occurs if and only if the points form a regular\n2\nequatorial simplex in Rn \u22121 . For |S| > n2 , the largest inner product \u03b2 satisfies\n\u03b2\u2265\n\nm2\n,\nn\n\n(7.2)\n\nand equality requires |S| \u2264 2(n2 \u2212 1). Equality occurs if the points are the\n2\n2(n2 \u2212 1) vertices of a regular orthoplex in Rn \u22121 .\nIf S is an {\u03b1}-code, then solving inequality (7.1) for |S| recovers the relative\nbound in Corollary 6.5. Moreover, if |S| = n2 (equality in the absolute bound\nof Corollary 6.2), then\nm(mn \u2212 1)\n.\n\u03b1=\nn2 \u2212 1\nOn the other hand, if S is a {0, m2 /n}-code, and m = n/2, then the relative\nbound in Corollary 6.6 implies that\n|S| \u2264 2(n2 \u2212 1),\nwhich corresponds to equality in the orthoplex bound (7.2).\n\n8\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we give examples demonstrating the tightness of the bounds in\nthe previous sections.\nWhen the rank m of the Grassmannian subspaces is 1, we recover all the\nclassical results of Delsarte, Goethals and Seidel [11] for lines in complex projective space: their paper gives several examples of bounds with equality. In\nparticular, the upper bound for {\u03b1}-codes in CP n\u22121 is n2 , and equality can\nonly hold with a trace inner product value of \u03b1 = 1/(n + 1). Examples of\ntightness have been found for several small values of n and are conjectured\nto exist for every n. These equiangular lines are sometimes called symmetric\ninformationally complete POVMs in the quantum information literature: see\n[19] for more details or [18] for recent results. Another important example in\nG1,n is the relative bound (Corollary 6.6) with inner product values of \u03b1 = 0\n\n19\n\n\fand \u03b2 = 1/n. The upper bound for the size of an {0, 1/n}-code is n(n + 1),\nand when equality is achieved we have what is known as a maximal set of mutually unbiased bases. Constructions achieving the bound are known when n\nis a prime power; see [14] for some constructions and [20] for applications to\nquantum information.\nIn the case m = n/2, if a is in Gm,n , then its orthogonal complement a\u22a5 is\nalso in Gm,n , and a and a\u22a5 have a trace inner product of 0. Here again, such\nsubspaces have applications in quantum state tomography; more details will\nbe found in [13]. If S is a {0, n/4}-code in Gn/2,n , then by the relative bound\n(Corollary 6.6), S has size at most 2(n2 \u2212 1). In these case we may assume\nthat both a and a\u22a5 are in S, because if a and b have a trace inner product of\nn/4, then so do a\u22a5 and b. The following construction, due to Martin R\u00f6tteler,\ndemonstrates that Corollary 6.6 is tight when n is a power of 2.\nTheorem 8.1. Let X1 , . . . , Xn2 \u22121 be the Pauli matrices of order n = 2k , and\nlet\n1\nMi := (I + Xi ).\n2\n2\n\nThen \u222ani=1\u22121 {Mi , I \u2212 Mi } is the set of projection matrices for a {0, n/4}-code\nof size 2(n2 \u2212 1) in Gn/2,n .\nMore generally, the bound is tight when n is the order of a Hadamard\nmatrix: details of the following construction will appear in in [13].\nTheorem 8.2. Suppose there is a Hadamard matrix of order n. Then there\nexists a {0, n/4}-code of size 2(n2 \u2212 1) in Gn/2,n .\nWhen the dimension of the complex space is an odd prime power, there\nis another construction which acheives the relative bound with equality. The\nfollowing is the complex version of a set of real Grassmannian packings due to\nCalderbank, Hardin, Rains, Shor, and Sloane [7]. For lack of another reference\nin the complex case, the details are included here.\nLet V := Fnq , where q = pk and p is an odd prime, and let {ev : v \u2208 V } be\nn\nthe standard basis for Cq . Then define the q n \u00d7 q n Pauli matrices\nX(a) : ev 7\u2192 ev+a ,\n\nT v)\n\nY (a) : ev 7\u2192 \u03c9 tr(a\n\nev ,\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a p-th\nroot of unity. Note that ev is an eigenvalue for\nP primitive\nT\nY (a) and e\u2217v := a \u03c9 tr(a v) ea is an eigenvalue for X(a). Define the extraspecial\nPauli group E to be generated by all X(a), Y (a), and \u03c9I; it has pq n elements,\n\n20\n\n\fall of the form \u03c9 i X(a)Y (b), for i \u2208 Zp , a, b \u2208 V . Its center is Z(E) = h\u03c9Ii, and\nE := E/Z(E) is Abelian and therefore a vector space isomorphic to V 2 under\nthe mapping\n(a, b) 7\u2192 X(a)Y (b)/Z(E).\nThe space V 2 has a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form (a symplectic\nform), namely\nh(a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 )i := tr(aT1 b2 \u2212 aT2 b1 ).\n\nIt is not difficult to check that two elements in E, say wi X(a1 )Y (b1 ) and\nwj X(a2 )Y (b2 ), commute if and only if their images in E/Z(E) satisfy\nh(a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 )i = 0.\nSubspaces on which the symplectic form vanishes are called totally isotropic.\nTherefore, a subspace W of E/Z(E) is totally isotropic if and only if its preimage W in E is an Abelian subgroup.\nWe now use characters of subgroups of E to define elements of Gqk ,qn . Let\nW be a totally isotropic subspace of E/Z(E) of dimension n \u2212 k, and let W be\nthe preimage of W in E. If \u03c7 : W \u2192 C is a character of W , then \u03c7\u2032 : W \u2192 C\ndefined by\n\u03c7\u2032 (\u03c9 i X(a)Y (b)) = \u03c9 \u2212i \u03c7(X(a)Y (b)/Z(E))\nis a character of W .

If W is an (n \u2212 k)-dimensional totally isotropic subspace of\nE/Z(E) and \u03c7 is a character of W , then \u03a0\u03c7 is the projection matrix for a\nn\nq k -dimensional subspace of Cq which is invariant under the action of W .\nProof. It is not difficult to check that \u03a0\u03c7 is Hermitian and \u03a02\u03c7 = \u03a0\u03c7 . It is also\nn\nnot difficult to check that \u03a0\u03c7 v is an eigenvector of g \u2208 W for any v \u2208 Cp , so\n\u03a0\u03c7 is a projection matrix for an invariant subspace. The rank of \u03a0\u03c7 is the trace\nof \u03a0\u03c7 , which can be computed as follows, after noting that the only elements\nof E with non-zero trace are the multiples of the identity:\np\n1 X \u2032\n1 X \u2212i\ntr(\u03a0\u03c7 ) =\n\u03c9 tr(\u03c9 i I) = q k .\n\u03c7 (g) tr(g) = n\u2212k\n|W |\npq\ni\ni=1\n\ng=\u03c9 I\n\nIn the construction that follows we require the q-binomial coefficients, defined as\n\u0014 \u0015\n(q n \u2212 1) . . .

Ht (m, n) may also be thought of as the\nsymmetric polynomials of degree at most t in the principle angles of pairs of\nsubspaces in Gm,n . Since the zonal orthogonal polynomials Z\u03bc,a (with |\u03bc| \u2264 t\nand len(\u03bc) \u2264 m) span Ht (m, n) and are contained in Homt (n), it follows that\nHt (m, n) is a subspace of Homt (n).\nWe call a finite subset S \u2286 Gm,n a t-design if, for every polynomial f in\nHt (m, n),\nZ\n1 X\nf (c) dc.\nf (a) =\n|S|\nGm,n\na\u2208S\n\nIn other words, the average of f over S is the same as the average of f over\nthe entire Grassmannian space. Recall that the average of f over Gm,n can be\nwritten as h1, f i: with this in mind we define an inner product for functions on\nS as follows:\n1 X\nhf, giS :=\nf (a)g(a).\n|S|\na\u2208S\n\nThen S is a t-design if h1, f i = h1, f iS for every f \u2208 Ht (m, n). Equivalently,\nthe zonal orthogonal polynomials Z\u03bc,a span H\u03bc , so S is a t-design if every Z\u03bc,a\nhas the same averages over S and Gm,n , where \u03bc is a partition of at most t into\nat most m parts.\nP\nBy way of example, consider Theorem 6.4. If f = \u03bc c\u03bc g\u03bc and c\u03bc > 0 for\nevery |\u03bc| \u2264 t, then equality in Theorem 6.4 implies that S is a t-design.\n\n23\n\n\fFor the purposes of quantum tomography applications, 1- and 2-designs\nplay a special role (see [13], as well as [21]). In those cases, there is a more\nexplicit description of a t-design.\nLemma 9.1. Let S be a finite subset of Gm,n .

Writing Pa = m\ni=1 ai ai for some orthonormal basis\n{ai } of a, and letting T denote the \"swap\" operator T : ei \u2297 ej 7\u2192 ej \u2297 ei , the\nintegral is obtained from Lemma 5.3 of [20]:\nZ\nm\n[(nm \u2212 1)I + (n \u2212 m)T ] .\nPa \u2297 Pa da =\n2\nn(n \u2212 1)\nGm,n\nProof. We prove the lemma by showing that Ht = Homt for t \u2208 {1, 2}; the\nresult then follows by considering the polynomials of the form a 7\u2192 (Pa )ij in\nHom1 and a 7\u2192 (Pa )ij (Pa )kl in Hom2 .\nRecall that Ht is contained in Homt , so it suffices to show that the dimensions of the spaces are equal. When t = 1, we have dim(H1 ) = dim(Hom1 ) = n2 ,\n2\u0001\nso H1 = Hom1 . When t = 2, recall that dim(H2 ) = n2 (assuming m > 1),\nand the space of homogeneous degree-2 polynomials on the coordinates of n \u00d7 n\n\u0001\n2\nmatrices has dimension n 2+1 . However, Hom2 is the space of degree-2 polynomials on projection matrices, not general matrices. If Pa is a projection matrix,\nthen the degree-2 polynomial\nPa 7\u2192 m tr(APa2 ) \u2212 tr(Pa ) tr(APa )\nis identically zero for every A.

The following is the absolute bound.\nLemma 9.2. If S is a t-design, then\n|S| \u2265 dim(H\u230at/2\u230b (m, n)).\nProof.\nLet {e1 , . . . , eN } be an orthonormal basis for H\u230at/2\u230b . Since ei is a\nsymmetric polynomial in the eigenvalues, so is ei ej . It follows from the unique\ndecomposition of L2 (Gm,n ) that ei ej is in H2\u230at/2\u230b and therefore in Ht . If S is a\nt-design, and ei ej is in Ht , then\nhei , ej i = h1, ei ej i = h1, ei ej iS = hei , ej iS ,\nwhence it follows that {e1 , . . . , el } are orthogonal as functions of S (a space of\ndimension |S|).\nIf equality holds, then the basis for Ht/2 (m, n) is also a basis for the functions\non S.

Let f (x1 , . . . , xm ) \u2208 R[x] be a symmetric polynomial such\nthat f =\n\u03bc c\u03bc Z\u03bc , where Z\u03bc is a zonal polynomial for the Grassmanian\nspace, and c0 > 0. Furthermore, suppose S is a t-design such that fa (b) =\nf (y1 (a, b), . . . , ym (a, b)) \u2265 0 for every a 6= b in S, and c\u03bc \u2264 0 for every |\u03bc| > t.\nThen\nf (1, . . . , 1)\n.\n|S| \u2265\nc0\nProof. Let fa be the zonal polynomial of f at a, so that fa (b) \u2265 0 for b 6= a.\nSumming over all b \u2208 S,\n|S| h1, fa iS \u2265 fa (a) = f (1, . . . , 1).\nAgain averaging over all a \u2208 S,\nf (1, . . . , 1) \u2264\n=\n\nX\na\u2208S\n\nh1, fa iS\n\nXX\na\u2208S \u03bc\n\n=\n\nX\n\nc\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n25\n\nc\u03bc h1, Z\u03bc,a iS\n\nX\na\u2208S\n\nh1, Z\u03bc,a iS .\n\n\fSince S is a t-design, the inner sum is zero for |\u03bc| \u2264 t (\u03bc 6= 0). For |\u03bc| > t, the\ninner sum is nonnegative (by Lemma 5.1) and c\u03bc \u2264 0. Therefore,\nX\nh1, Z0,a iS\nf (1) \u2264 c0\na\u2208S\n\n= c0 |S|.\n\nIf equality holds, then we have f (a, b) = 0 for every a 6= b in S. That\nis, S is an f -code. Furthermore, for every |\u03bc| > t, we have either c\u03bc = 0 or\nP\na\u2208S Z\u03bc,a = 0.\nAs with classical codes and designs, the case where S is both a f -code and\na t-design is of particular interest, as the size of the set can be determined\nexactly. Combining Theorems 6.4 and 9.3 gives the following.\nP\nTheorem 9.4. Suppose S is an f -code for f = \u03bc c\u03bc Z\u03bc , where c\u03bc \u2265 0, and S\nis also a t-design for t \u2265 deg(f ). Then\n|S| =\n\nf (1, 1, . . . , 1)\n.\nc0\n\nConsider the following polynomial in Ht (m, n):\nX\nZt :=\nZ\u03bc .\n|\u03bc|\u2264t\nlen(\u03bc)\u2264m\n\nThis polynomial satisfies hZt,a , f i = f (a) for every f \u2208 Ht (m, n). Taking f = Zt\nin Theorem 9.4, we get:\nCorollary 9.5. If S is a Zt -code and a 2t-design, then\n|S| = dim(Ht (m, n)).\nTheorem 9.6. Any two of the following imply the third:\n\u2022 S is an f -code, where deg(f ) = t;\n\n\u2022 S is a 2t-design;\n\n\u2022 |S| = dim(Ht (m, n)).\nProof. Suppose S is a f -code with |S| = dim(Ht ). Since equality holds in\nCorollary 6.3, the polynomials fa are a basis for Ht . However, we have\n(\n0,\nb 6= a;\nhZt,a , fb i = fb (a) =\nf (1, 1, . . . , 1), b = a.\n\n26\n\n\fThus {Zt,a } is a dual basis for Ht and each Zt,a is a multiple of ft,a . Now\nconsider the averages hZt,a , fb iS : since fa (b) = Zt,a (b) = 0 for b 6= a, we get\n(\n0,\nb 6= a;\nhZt,a , fb iS =\nf (1, 1, . . . , 1), b = a.\nThus we have\nh1, Zt,a fb iS = Zt,a , fb\n\nS\n\n= Zt,a , fb = h1, Zt,a fb i\n\nfor the bases {Zt,a } and {fb }. But the set {Zt,a fb } spans H2t (n), so S is a\n2t-design.\nConversely, suppose S is a 2t-design with |S| = dim(Ht ), and let f annihilate\nof the angle set of A. Since Ht spans the functions on |S|, each fa is in Ht and\nis therefore a polynomial of degree t. Thus f has degree t.\nThe simplest case of Theorem 9.6 is when t = 1: in this case, S is a 1distance set and a 2-design of size n2 . Moreover, S is a Z1 -code, and Z1 is\n. Thus the inner product between every two distinct\nthe annihilator of m(mn\u22121)\nn2 \u22121\nsubspaces is \u03b1 =\n\n10\n\nm(mn\u22121)\nn2 \u22121 .\n\nAssociation schemes\n\nAs Theorem 9.6 indicates, sets of Grassmannian subspaces which reach equality\nin the Delsarte bounds have a great deal of structure. In this section, we show\nthat-much like spherical codes and spherical designs-these sets are often\nendowed with the structure of an association scheme.\nLet S be an f -code with a finite number of distinct sets of principal angles\ny = (y1 , . . . , ym ). Denote the set of y's that occur by Y. For each y \u2208 Y, define\na |S| \u00d7 |S| matrix as follows:\n(\n1, a, b have principal angles y;\nAy (a, b) :=\n0, otherwise.\nEach Ay is a symmetric\nP {0, 1}-matrix. Furthermore, each pair (a, b) has some\nprincipal angle y, so y\u2208Y Ay = J, where J is the all-ones matrix. If y0 :=\n(1, . . . , 1) denotes the trivial principal angles set, then A0 := Ay0 is the identity\nmatrix. We will call the Ay matrices Schur idempotents, as they are idempotent\nunder Schur multiplication, defined as follows:\n(A \u25e6 B)ij := Aij Bij .\n\n27\n\n\fUnder certain conditions, these Schur idempotents form an association scheme.\nFor each integer partition \u03bc and corresponding zonal polynomial Z\u03bc , define\nan |S| \u00d7 |S| matrix as follows:\nE\u03bc (a, b) :=\n\n1\nZ\u03bc (a, b).\n|S|\n\nEach E\u03bc is also symmetric and in the span of {Ay }y\u2208Y :\nE\u03bc =\n\n1 X\nZ\u03bc (y)Ay .\n|S|\ny\u2208Y\n\nIn particular, E0 is a scalar multiple of J. When {Ay }y\u2208Y forms an association\nscheme, the matrices E\u03bc are the scheme's idempotents.\nLemma 10.1. If S is a 2t-design, then {E\u03bc }|\u03bc|\u2264t,len(\u03bc)\u2264m are a set of orthogonal\nidempotents.\nProof. Suppose |\u03bc| = i and |\u03bb| = j, with i, j \u2264 t. Then\n(E\u03bc E\u03bb )a,b =\n\n1 X\nZ\u03bc (a, c)Z\u03bb (c, b)\n|S|2\nc\u2208S\n\n1\nhZ\u03bc,a , Z\u03bb,b iS .\n=\n|S|\n\nSince Z\u03bc,a and Z\u03bc,b are in Ht , their product is in H2t . Now S is a 2t-design, so\nthe average of Z\u03bc,a Z\u03bb,b over S is the same as the average over Gm,n . But\nhZ\u03bc,a , Z\u03bb,b i = \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bc Z\u03bc (a, b),\nand so we find that E\u03bc E\u03bb = \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bc E\u03bc .\nMore generally, if |\u03bc| = i and |\u03bb| = j, and S is a (i + j)-design, then E\u03bc and\nE\u03bb are orthogonal.\nNow suppose S is a 2t-design. By the previous lemma {E\u03bc }|\u03bc|\u2264t are linearly\nindependent, and clearly the matrices {Ay }y\u2208Y are also linearly independent. If\n|Y| equals the number of partitions of at most t (into at most m parts), then the\nspan of {Ay }y\u2208Y and {E\u03bc }|\u03bc|\u2264t are the same. Since {E\u03bc }|\u03bc|\u2264t is closed under\nmultiplication, so too is the span of {Ay }y\u2208Y , and so we have an association\nscheme.\nCorollary 10.2. Let S be a 2t-design in Gm,n with principal angle set Y. If\n|Y| is equal to the total number of partitions of 0, 1, . . . , t into at most m parts,\nthen {Ay }y\u2208Y is an association scheme.\n\n28\n\n\fLemma 10.3. Let S be a 2t-design in Gm,n with principal angle set Y such\nthat |Y| is the total number of partitions of 0, 1, . . . , t into at most m parts.\nThen {E\u03bc }|\u03bc|\u2264t,len(\u03bc)\u2264m are the idempotents of the scheme {Ay }y\u2208Y .\n1 P\nProof.\nSince E\u03bc = |S|\ny\u2208Y Z\u03bc (y)Ay , we see that the matrix [Z\u03bc (y)] is\nthe transition matrix between the two bases of the association scheme and is\ntherefore invertible. It follows that for each yi in Y, some linear combination of\nthe rows Z\u03bc forms a homogeneous degree-t polynomial gi such that gi (yj ) = \u03b4ij .\n(Conversely, if such gi polynomials exist, then [Z\u03bc (y)] is invertible.) Then\n(Ai E\u03bc )a,b =\n\n1\n|S|\n\nX\n\nZ\u03bc (c, b)\n\nc:y(a,c)=yi\n\n= hgi,a , Z\u03bc,b iS\n\n= hgi,a , Z\u03bc,b i .\nNow write gi =\n\nP\n\n|\u03bb|\u2264t ci,\u03bb Z\u03bb ,\n\nhgi,a , Z\u03bc,b i =\n\nso that\n\nX\n\n|\u03bb|\u2264t\n\nci,\u03bb hZ\u03bb,a , Z\u03bc,b i = ci,\u03bc Z\u03bc (a, b).\n\nThus Ai E\u03bc = ci,\u03bc E\u03bc for some ci,\u03bc .\nBy way of example, let t = 1, and suppose S is a 2-design with only one\nnontrivial principal angle set (and one trivial one, for a total of two). The\nnumber of partitions of at most 1 is also two (\u03bc = 0 and \u03bc = (1)), so by\nCorollary 10.2 we have an association scheme. In this case the scheme is the\ntrivial one, namely {I, J \u2212 I}.\nAs another example of an association scheme obtained from principal angles,\nconsider the collection of subspaces in Gn/2,n from Theorem 8.1. This collection\nhas four distinct sets of principal angles:\ny = (1, . . . , 1)\n\n(trivial principal angles),\n\ny = (0, . . . , 0)\n\n(angles between a and a\u22a5 ),\n\ny = (1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0),\n| {z } | {z }\nn/4\n\ny=\n\nn/4\n\n( 21 , . . . , 21 ).\n\nWhile |Y| = 4 is the number of partitions of at most 2 (\u03bc = 0, \u03bc = (1),\n\u03bc = (1, 1) and \u03bc = (2)), the hypotheses of Corollary 10.2 are not satisfied\n\n29\n\n\fbecause the subspaces do not form a 4-design. Nevertheless, it is easy to verify\ncomputationally that this collection does give a 3-class association scheme.\nWe may define a coarser set of relations on an f -code S using the sums of\nprincipal angles-the inner products of the projection matrices-instead of the\nprincipal angles themselves. Let A denote the set of nontrivial inner product\nvalues that occur in S, so S is an A-code. For \u03b1 \u2208 A let A\u2032\u03b1 be the |S| \u00d7 |S|\nmatrix defined as follows:\n(\n1, tr(Pa Pb ) = \u03b1,\nA\u2032\u03b1 (a, b) :=\n0, otherwise.\nAlso define A\u2032m := I for the identity relation. Clearly each A\u2032\u03b1 is in the span of\n{Ay : y \u2208 Y}; in fact\nX\nA\u2032\u03b1 =\nAy .\ny\u2208Y:\n\nP\n\nyi =\u03b1\n\nA\u2032m\n\nIn particular,\n= A0 = I, and if 0 is in A, then A\u20320 = A(0,...,0) . As before, the\nmatrices are Schur idempotents and sum to J. Next we need the corresponding\nidempotents. For each i \u2208 {0, . . . , t}, define Ei\u2032 as follows:\nX\nEi\u2032 :=\nE\u03bc .\n|\u03bc|=i\n\nThis implies that E0\u2032 = J/|S| and Ei\u2032 (a, b) = (Zi (a, b) \u2212 Zi\u22121 (a, b))/|S| for\ni > 0. As in Lemma 10.1, if S is a 2t-design, then {Ei\u2032 : i \u2264 t} is a set of\northogonal idempotents, and if S is a (2t \u2212 1)-design, then {Ei\u2032 : i \u2264 t} are\nlinearly independent.\nClearly Ei\u2032 is in the span of {Ay : y \u2208 Y}, since each E\u03bc is in that span. But\nsuppose Zi (y)\nP is the annihilator polynomial of some i-distance set, so it is a only\nfunction of i yi : then in fact Ei\u2032 is in the span of {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A}. If Zi (y) is an\nannihilator for sufficiently many i, then {Ei\u2032 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t} and {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A\u222a{m}}\nspan the same set, and that set is closed under multiplication.\nCorollary 10.4. Let S be a 2t-design that is also an A-code in Gm,n . If |A| \u2264 t,\nand Zi (y) is an annihilator polynomial for each i \u2264 t, then {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A \u222a {m}}\nis an association scheme.\nIn fact, these hypotheses can be weakened.\nTheorem 10.5. Let S be a (2t \u2212 2)-design that is also an A-code in Gm,n . If\n|A| = t, and Zi (y) is an annihilator for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1, then {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208\nA \u222a {m}} is an association scheme.\n\n30\n\n\fProof. Since S is a 2(t \u2212 1)-design, the idempotents {Ei\u2032 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1}\nare linearly independent. We claim\nP that I\u2032 is also linearly independent from\n{Ei\u2032 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1}. For, if I = t\u22121\nentries of I\ni=0 ci Ei , then the off-diagonal\nP\nare functions of a polynomial of degree at most t \u2212 1 in j yj , namely\n!\nt\u22121\nX\n1\nci (Zi (y) \u2212 Zi\u22121 (y)) .\nc0 +\n|S|\ni=1\n\nBut\n0, implying that the polynomial has t roots in\nP all off-diagonal entries are\n\u2032 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t \u2212 1} \u222a {I} is linearly independent and\ny\n,\na\ncontradition.\nSo\n{E\ni\ni i\ntherefore spans {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A \u222a {m}}. Since it is closed under multiplication, we\nhave an association scheme.\n\nBy way of example, suppose t = 2 in Theorem 10.5. Note that Z0 (y) and\nZ1 (y) are always annihilators. It follows that if S is a 2-design, and the inner\nproduct set A = {tr(Pa Pb ) : a 6= b \u2208 S} contains exactly two distinct values,\nthen {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A \u222a {m}} is a 2-class association scheme.\nCorollary 10.6. Let S be a (2t \u2212 2)-design and an A-code in Gm,n such that\n|A| = t and Zi (y) is an annihilator for i \u2264 t \u2212 1. Then P\nthe idempotents of the\nt\u22121 \u2032\n\u2032 , and J \u2212\nscheme {A\u2032\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A \u222a {m}} are E0\u2032 , . . . , Et\u22121\ni=0 Ei .\n\nProof. Let f\u03b1 denote the annihilator polynomial of A\\{\u03b10 , \u03b1},\nP normalized\nso that f\u03b1 (\u03b1) = 1. Then f\u03b1 is a polynomial of degree t \u2212 1 in i yi , and the\ncorresponding\nzonal polynomial f\u03b1,a is in Ht\u22121 (n). Writing Pi := Zi \u2212 Zi\u22121 =\nP\nZ\n,\nwe\nhave\n|\u03bc|=i \u03bc\n(A\u2032\u03b1 Ei\u2032 )a,b =\n\n1\n|S|\n\nX\n\nPi (tr(Pc Pb ))\n\ntr(Pa Pc )=\u03b1\n\nf\u03b1 (m)\nPi (tr(Pa Pb ))\n|S|\nf\u03b1 (m)\nPi (tr(Pa Pb )).\n= hf\u03b1,a , Pi,b i \u2212\n|S|\nP\nNow decomposing into its degrees as f\u03b1 = i c\u03b1,i Pi , we get\n= hf\u03b1,a , Pi,b iS \u2212\n\nf\u03b1 (m)\nPi (tr(Pa Pb ))\n|S|\nf\u03b1 (m)\n= c\u03b1,i Pi (tr(Pa Pb )) \u2212\nPi (tr(Pa Pb ))\n|S|\n= (c\u03b1,i |S| \u2212 f\u03b1 (m))(Ei\u2032 )a,b .\n\n(A\u2032\u03b1 Ei\u2032 )a,b = c\u03b1,i hPi,a , Pi,b i \u2212\n\nThus A\u2032\u03b1 Ei\u2032 = \u03bb\u03b1,i Ei\u2032 for some constant \u03bb\u03b1,i .\n\n31\n\n\f11\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank Martin R\u00f6tteler, Chris Godsil, Bill Martin, and\nBarry Sanders for their helpful discussions.
