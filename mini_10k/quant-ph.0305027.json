It is shown that constant homogeneous electric field completely\nremoves the degeneracy of the energy levels on azimuth quantum number.\n\nIn February 2003 Professor Valery Ter-Antonyan: an intellectual, brilliant pedagogue and the expert\nin quantum mechanics, passed away. During the last years of his life he took a great interest in the study\nof the Coulomb problem in the presence of topologically nontrivial objects. The two of us had the honour\nof collaborating with him in this sphere. This modest work is a tribute to his memory.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe integrable system MIC-Kepler was constructed by Zwanziger [1] and rediscovered by McIntosh and\nCisneros [2]. This system is described by the Hamiltonian\nH0 =\n\n\u03b3\nh\u03042\nh\u03042 s2\n\u2212 ,\n(i\u2207 + sA)2 +\n2\n2\u03bc\n2\u03bcr\nr\n\nwhere rotA =\n\nr\n.\nr3\n\n(1.1)\n\nIts distinctive peculiarity is the hidden symmetry given by the following constants of motion (1.1)\nI=\n\nr\nh\u0304\n[(i\u2207 + sA) \u00d7 J \u2212 J \u00d7 (i\u2207 + sA)] + \u03b3 ,\n2\u03bc\nr\n\nJ = \u2212h\u0304(i\u2207 + sA) \u00d7 r +\n\nh\u0304sr\n.\nr\n\n(1.2)\n\nThese constants of motion, together with the Hamiltonian, form the quadratic symmetry algebra of the\nCoulomb problem. The operator J defines the angular momentum of the system, while the operator I\nis the analog of the Runge-Lenz vector. For the fixed negative values of energy the constants of motion\nform the so(4) algebra, whereas for positive values of energy - the so(3.1) one. Due to the hidden\nsymmetry the MIC-Kepler problem could be factorized in few coordinate systems, e. g. in the spherical\nand parabolic ones. Hence, the MIC-Kepler system is a natural generalization of the Coulomb problem\nin the presence of Dirac monopole. The monopole number s satisfies the Dirac's charge quantization rule,\ns = 0, \u00b11/2, \u00b11, . . ..\nThe MIC-Kepler system could be constructed by the reduction of the four-dimensional isotropic\noscillator by the use of the so-called Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation both on classical and quantum\nmechanical levels [3]. In the similar way, reducing the two- and eight- dimensional isotropic oscillator,\none can obtain the two- [4] and five-dimensional [5] analogs of MIC-Kepler system. An infinitely thin\nsolenoid providing the system by the spin 1/2, plays the role of monopole in two-dimensional case,\nwhereas in the five-dimensional case this role is performed by the SU (2) Yang monopole [6], endowing\nthe system by the isospin. All the above-mentioned systems have Coulomb symmetries and are solved in\nspherical and parabolic coordinates both in discrete and continuous parts of energy spectra [7]. There\nare generalizations of MIC-Kepler systems on three-dimensional sphere [8] and hyperboloid [9] tas well.\nFor integer values s the MIC-Kepler system describes the relative motion of the two Dirac dyons\n(charged magnetic monopoles). For this we should place\ns=\n\neG \u2212 Qg\n,\nh\u0304c\n\n\u03b3 = eQ + gG,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere (e, g) and (Q, G) are electric and magnetic charges of the first and the second dyons respectively.\nParameter \u03bc plays the role of the reduced mass, while vector r determines the position of the second\n1\n\n\fdyon with respect to the first one [1]. For half-integer s the presence of the magnetic field of infinitely\nthin solenoid, endowing the system with the spin 1/2, is also supposed (compare with [4]). It should be\nnoted that the MIC-Kepler system describes also the relative motion of two Dirac dyons as well as that\nof the twowll-separated BPS monopoles/dyons 1 .\nThe wavefunction of the ground state of the MIC-Kepler problem is of the form:\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03c8m,\u00b1|s| = const r|s| e\u2212r/a(|s|+1) (cos )|s|\u00b1m (\u00b1 sin )|s|\u2213m eim\u03c6 ,\n2\n2\n\nm = \u2212|s|, \u2212|s| + 1, . . . , |s| \u2212 1, |s|. (1.5)\n\nAs is seen, it is degenerated with respect to the quantum number m and is not spherically symmetric:\nthe system has a non-zero dipole momentum and in the presence of the external electric field the linear\nStark effect is possible. Hence, it seems to be interesting to study the behavior of the MIC-Kepler bound\nsystem behaviour in the constant uniform electric field with the purpose to investigate the Stark effect\nand to calculate the dipole momentum. The aim of the present paper is the study of these issues.\nFor convenience, we will consider a special case of the charge moving in the field of the Dirac dyon,\ni.e. the system most symilar to the hydrogen atom. In other words, we assume\nG = 0,\n\n(1.6)\n\nso that the perturbative correction to the MIC-Kepler Hamiltonian (1.1), which is responsible for the\ninteraction of the charge-dyon system with the external constant uniform electric field has the same form\nas in the case of the hydrogen atom,\nHS = e\u03b5r.\n(1.7)\nThe paper is organazed as follows.\nIn Section 2 we bring wave functions of the MIC-Kepler bound system in spherical and parabolic\ncoordinates.\nIn Section 3 the behaviour of the charge-dyon bound system in the constant uniform electric field is\ninvestigated. The assumption of the presence of the linear Stark effect in the system is confirmed and\nits dipole momentum is calculated. It is shown that the external electric field completely removes the\ndegeneracy on azimuth quantum number.\nIn Conclusion we summarize the obtained results discuss their possible generalizations.\n\n2\n\nWavefunctions and spectrum\n\nLet us consider a spectral problem describing the MIC-Kepler problem with the energy E (0) , with the\nangular momentum j and with the x3 -component of the angular momentum m:\nH0 \u03c8 = E (0) \u03c8,\n\nJ2 \u03c8 = h\u03042 j(j + 1)\u03c8\n\nJ3 \u03c8 = h\u0304m\u03c8\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere H0 , J are defined by the expressions (1.1),(1.2) with the Dirac's monopole vector potential with\nthe sigularity line directed along the positive semiaxis x3\nA=\n\n1\n(x2 , \u2212x1 , 0)\nr(r \u2212 x3 )\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe solution to this system is as follows:\n\u03c8njm (r; s) =\n1 The\n\n\u0012\n\n2j + 1\n8\u03c0 2\n\n\u00131/2\n\nRnj (r/a)djms (\u03b8)eim\u03c6 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nsystem describing the relative motion of the two well-separated BPS dyons [10] is specified by the Hamiltonian\nHBP S =\n\n1\n4\u03bc\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\u03bc\nr\n\n\u0011\u22123/2\n\n\u0010\n\n(i\u2207 + sA) 1 \u2212\n\n2\u03bc\nr\n\n\u00111/2\n\n(i\u2207 + sA) +\n\neg\n,\nr\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere e denote the relative electric charge of the BPS monopoles. As is seen the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of this Hamiltonian\ncould be immediately transformed to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the MIC-Kepler problem. While the Coulomb symmetry\nin this system is well-known one, its equivalence to the MIC-Kepler problem might have been noticed in [11]\n\n2\n\n\fwhere djms is the Wigner d-function [12], and Rnj (r/a) is defined by the expression\ns\n(n + j)! j \u2212r/n\n2j+1\n2r\nRnj (r) =\nr e\nF (j \u2212 n + 1, 2j + 2, ).\nnj+2 (2j + 1)! (n \u2212 j \u2212 1)!\nn\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere a = h\u03042 /\u03bcee is Bohr radius. The spectrum of the system is specified by the conditions:\n(0)\n\n2\n\nEn = \u2212 2h\u0304\u03bc\u03b32 n2 , n = |s| + 1, |s| + 2, . . .\n\nj = |s|, |s| + 1, . . . , n \u2212 1;\n\nm = \u2212j, \u2212j + 1, . . . , j \u2212 1, j\n\n(2.5)\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe quantum numbers j, m characterize the total momentum of the system and its projection on the axis\nx3 . For the (half)integer s j, m are (half)integers. Performing the identity transformation \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c0,\none can see, that the wavefunction of the system is single-valued for the integer s and changes its signs\nfor the half-integer s. In the latter case the ambiguity of the wave function can be interpreted as the\npresence of the magnetic field of the infinitely thin solenoid (directed along the axis x3 ) providing the\nsystem by spin 1/2. In the ground state (n = 1) we have j = |s|, so that the wavefunction is of the form\n(1.5).\nLet us consider the MIC-Kepler system on the parabolic basis.

Thus, for convenience, the parabolic wavefunctions (2.13) of the MIC-Kepler system are chosen\nas nonperturbed ones for the calculation of the matrix elements of transitions between the mutually\ndegenerated states.\nWe are mostly interested the matrix elements of the transitions n1 n2 m \u2192 n\u20321 n\u20322 m\u2032 for the fixed value\nof the principal quantum number n. The perturbation operator in parabolic coordinates reads\nV\u0302 = |e|\u03b5z = |e|\u03b5(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)/2.\nAccording to the perturbation theory the first-order corrections to the energy eigenvalue En (2.5) are of\nthe form\nZ\nEn(1) =\n\u03c8n\u2217 1 n2 m (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6)V\u0302 \u03c8n1 n2 m (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c6) d\u03c6.\n(3.2)\n\nHence, taking into account (2.13), we get\nEn(1) =\nwhere\nIpq =\n\nZ\n\n|e|\u03b5\n(In1 ,m\u2212s In2 ,m+s \u2212 In1 ,m\u2212s In2 ,m+s ) ,\n4a3 n4\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n[\u03a6pq (x)] dx,\n\nIpq =\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\nx2 [\u03a6pq (x)] dx.\n\n2 F1\n\n(\u03b1, \u03b2; \u03b3; 1) =\n\n\u0393(\u03b3)\u0393(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n.\n\u0393(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1)\u0393(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\nAs a result we will obtain the following expressions\n\u0015\n\u0014\n|q|\nIpq = an,\nIpq = 2(an)3 3p(p + |q| + 1) + (|q| + 3) + 1 .\n2\n\n4\n\n(3.4)\n\n0\n\nLater on, we will make use the formulae (see, e.g. [13])\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nk\n\u2212\u03bbz \u03bd\n\u2212\u03bd\u22121\n,\ne\nz1 F1 (\u03b1; \u03b3; kz) dz = \u0393(\u03bd + 1)\u03bb\n2 F1 \u03b1, \u03bd + 1; \u03b3;\n\u03bb\n0\nand\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fNow, using these formulae, we could get the first-order correction to the energy eigenvalue (2.5)\nEn(1)\n\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n|m \u2212 s| \u2212 |m + s|\nms\n3h\u03042 |e|\u03b5\nn n1 \u2212 n2 +\n+\n.\n=\n2\u03bc\u03b3\n2\n3\n\n(3.8)\n\nSimilar to the hydrogen atom, the linear term on n is proportional to the x3 -component of the RungeLenz vector. However, there is an extra correction linear on m, which removes the degeneracy on the\nx3 -component of the angular momentum.\nThus, in the \"charge-Dirac dyon\" system there is the linear Stark effect, completely removing the\ndegeneracy on azimuth quantum number m.\nFor the fixed s, according to the formula (2.16), the two extreme components of the splited energy\nlevel correspond to the following values of the parabolic quantum numbers: n1 = n \u2212 |s| \u2212 1, n2 = 0 and\nn1 = 0, n2 = n \u2212 |s| \u2212 1.

We have found that in spite of the deep similarity of the charge-dyon system with the\nhydrogen atom, the relation of the former system to the Stark effect is qualitatively differs from the latter\none. Namely, in the MIC-Kepler problem there is the linear Stark effect which completely removes the\ndegeneracy on azimuth quantum number m.\nIt deserves to be mentioned, that the Stark effect for the charge-dyon system cannot be naively\ntransferred on to the system of two dyons. In the latter case the interaction of the external field with\nthe magnetic charge have to be to be taken into consideration. Hence, the Stark effect in the system of\ntwo Dirac dyons will be equivalent to the superposition of should be the superposition of the Stark and\nZeeman effects in the charge-dyon system.\nUndoubtedly, the existance in the charge-dyon system of the linear Stark effect, as well as of the\nnonzero dipole momentum is due to the presence of magnetic monopole. It is clear, the system of two\nwell-separated BPS dyons will has similar properties, thought the transformation of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation corresponding to the Hamiltonian (3.1) yields the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the system of two\nwell-separated BPS dyons, perturbed by a nonlinear electric field. Besides, the formal equivalence of the\nMIC-Kepler system and of the two well-separated BPS dyons supposes the dependence of the coupling\nconstant of the latter system both on the coupling constant and of the energy of the MIC-Kepler.\nIt seems to be interesting consider the Stark effect in the MIC-Kepler system on the sphere and\nhyperboloid, with the aim of the revealing its dependence on the space curvature. The study of the Stark\neffect on the five-dimensional generalization of the MIC-Kepler problem (the so-called Yang-Coulomb\n5\n\n\for SU (2)-Kepler problem) [5] could be even more instructive, due to the presence of isospin degrees of\nfreedom.\n\nAcknowledgements.
