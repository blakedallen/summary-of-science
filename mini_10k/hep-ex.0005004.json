In the non-leptonic weak decay of hyperon, parity violation\nleads to a forward-backward asymmetric distribution of the daughter particles with\nrespect to the spin of the hyperon:\n\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\ndn\n1\n=\n1 + \u03b1P * p\u0302 =\n1 + \u03b1P cos\u03b8\ndcos\u03b8\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a parameter quantifying the degree of parity violation in the decay, P is\nthe polarization of the hyperon, and p\u0302 is the momentum unit vector of the daughter\nbaryon in the rest frame of the hyperon.\nUnder CP transformation, the strange-baryon decay is related to the corresponding decay of its anti-particle with the condition that\n\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1 .\n\n(2)\n\nThus, any violation of equation (2) would signal the breaking of CP symmetry in\nthe decay. Alternatively we can define a parameter\nA=\n\n\u03b1+\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\nfor measuring the amount of CP violation in the decay. The latest predictions of A\nfor hyperon decays are summarized in reference 1.\nTo date all searches of CP nonconservation in strange-baryon sector focussed\non the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 decay, with \u039b's and \u039b's produced in pp collisions 2,3 or from the J/\u03a8\ndecays.4 The best result of 0.013 \u00b1 0.022 for A\u039b came from LEAR PS185.3\nIn this talk, a new approach for studying CP symmetry in strange-baryon decay\nis presented. According to equation (1) \u039b hyperons with precisely known polarization are needed for determining \u03b1\u039b . Significantly polarized \u039b's can be created from\ncharged \u039e \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 decays. In this case, the polarization of the \u039b is given by\n\nP\u039b =\n\n(\u03b1\u039e + P\u039e * \u039b\u0302)\u039b\u0302 + \u03b2\u039e P\u039e \u00d7 \u039b\u0302 + \u03b3\u039e \u039b\u0302 \u00d7 (P\u039e \u00d7 \u039b\u0302)\n1 + \u03b1\u039e P\u039e * \u039b\u0302\n\n\u0001\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u039b\u0302 is the unit vector along the \u039b momentum in the \u039e rest frame, \u03b2\u039e and \u03b3\u039e\nare the other two decay parameters of the \u039e \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 decay, and P\u039e is the polarization\nof the \u039e. In the helicity frame of the \u039b the angular distribution of the proton is\n\n2\n\n\f\u0001\n1\ndn\n=\n1 + \u03b1\u039b \u03b1\u039e cos\u03b8p\u039b ,\ndcos\u03b8p\u039b\n2\n\n(5)\n\nindependent of the polarization of the \u039e. A new parameter, A\u039e\u039b , defined as\nA\u039e\u039b =\n\n\u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b \u2212 \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b\n\u2248 A\u039e + A\u039b\n\u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b + \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b\n\n(6)\n\nis used for searching for CP asymmetry in the \u039e \u2212 \u039b decay sequence. This new\nscheme was first demonstrated by E756 at Fermilab with polarized \u039e. A value of\n0.012 \u00b1 0.014 for A\u039e\u039b was obtained.5 Motivated by this successful study, a dedicated\nexperiment, HyperCP (E871), was proposed and is currently taking data at Fermilab\nto reach a projected sensitivity of 10\u22124 . The remainder of this talk will highlight\nthe analysis of E756 and present the status of HyperCP.\n\n2\n\nFNAL E756\n\nThe primary goals of FNAL E756 were to measure the magnetic moment of the \u03a9\u2212 6\nand to study the production polarization of hyperons.7,8,9 Along with the \u03a9\u2212 's a\nlarge sample of \u039e\u2212 decays was obtained.\nThis experiment was performed in the FNAL Proton-Center beam line during\nthe 1987 fixed-target run. The plan view of the E756 spectrometer is shown in\nFig.1. Polarized \u039e\u2212 hyperons were produced with an 800-GeV proton beam striking\na 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 9.2 cm-long beryllium target at an angle of 2.4 mrad in the vertical\nplane. After the strange baryons emerged from a curved collimator in a 7.3 m-long\nhyperon magnet, with its field in the vertical direction, they were allowed to decay\nin a 26 m-long region. The charged particles in the decay sequence \u039e\u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212\nand \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 were momentum analyzed with a simple spectrometer consisting of\nscintillation counters, silicon strip detectors, multiwire proportional chambers, and\ntwo dipole magnets. The trigger was designed to look for events with at least two\noppositely charged tracks downstream of the analysis magnets and with three or four\ntracks upstream. The targetting angle was cycled between 2.4 mrad and -2.4 mrad\nevery few hours to minimize temporal variations between runs. For each production\nangle, roughly equal number of events were also collected with the polarity of the\nanalysis magnets reversed and the left-right requirements of C8 and C9 interchanged.\n+\nTen days were spent to collect \u039e decays, the incident proton intensity was\n10\nreduced from 3 \u00d7 10 per 20-s spill to 1 \u00d7 1010 per spill, to maintain a similar singles\nrate in the spectrometer as the \u039e\u2212 run. The polarity of the hyperon magnet was also\nreversed but the trigger requirements and the production angles were unchanged,\n+\nthus reducing potential biases between the \u039e\u2212 and \u039e runs.\nFor the CP-symmetry study, the hyperon magnetic field was set for selecting\n\u039e's with monenta between 240 GeV/c and 450 GeV/c.\n\n3\n\n\fHyperon\nMagnet\nC9\n\nB\nS1\n\nX\n\nC1\n\nB\n\nC7\n\nC9 L\n\np\n\nL\n\nV2\n\np\n\nM\n\nC8 R\n\nC5\n\n800 GeV\nprotons\n\nC8\n\nC4\n\nV1\nC2 C3\n\nBe\nTarget\n\nX\n\nC6\n\nS2\n\np\n\nSilicon Strip\nDetectors\n\nMomentum Analyzing\nMagnets\n\nPlan View (not to scale)\n\nZ\n\nFigure 1.

Further details of the\nexperiment and the event selection can be found in reference 8.\nTwo different techniques were employed to extract A\u039e\u039b . In the first approach,\nthe value of \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b was determined with the Hybrid Monte Carlo method8 for the\n+\n+\n\u039e\u2212 and the \u039e samples separately. Based on about 70,000 \u039e decays, \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b was\n\u2212\nfound to be \u22120.2894 \u00b1 0.0073. From three independent \u039e samples, each with\napproximately 70,000 events, \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b was \u22120.2955 \u00b1 0.0073, \u22120.3041 \u00b1 0.0073, and\n\u22120.2894 \u00b1 0.0073, giving a mean of \u22120.2963 \u00b1 0.0042. As shown in Fig. 2 these\nresults were in good agreement with the world average10 and were stable with respect to the momentum of \u039e. This method gave a value of 0.012 \u00b1 0.014 for A\u039e\u039b ,\nwith insignificant systematic error that was estimated by varying event-selection\nrequirements.\n+\nIn the second approach, the difference in \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b between \u039e\u2212 and \u039e was determined directly without unfolding the acceptance in cos\u03b8p\u039b . For two data samples,\na comparison of the cos\u03b8p\u039b distributions can be defined by\nR(cos\u03b8p\u039b ) =\n\n\u01eb1 (cos\u03b8p\u039b ) [1 + (\u03b1\u039b \u03b1\u039e )1 cos\u03b8p\u039b ]\n\u01eb2 (cos\u03b8p\u039b ) [1 + (\u03b1\u039b \u03b1\u039e )2 cos\u03b8p\u039b ]\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R(cos\u03b8p\u039b ) is the ratio of the probabilities of getting cos\u03b8p\u039b in the two samples,\nand the \u01eb's are the acceptance functions of the cos\u03b8p\u039b distributions.\nWhen two sets of \u039e\u2212 events are compared, R is a measure of how well the\nacceptances agree.

E756 results on \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b as a function of the momentum of the \u039e. The shaded area\nis an one-standard-deviation band centered at the world average.\n\nceptance in cos\u03b8p\u039b was strongly dependent on the momentum of the \u039e\u2212 , but was\ninsensitive to the polarization of the \u039e\u2212 or other variations in the experiment down\nto a few \u00d710\u22123 level.11 This unique feature is due to the fact that the \u039b\u0302 defining the\nhelicity frame changes from event to event over the entire phase space in the \u039e rest\nframe. Any systematic bias due to imperfection of the experiment in the laboratory\nis mapped into a wide range of cos\u03b8p\u039b , thus highly diluted.\nIn the study of CP symmetry, a sample of \u039e\u2212 events was selected in such a way\n+\nthat the resulting \u039e\u2212 momentum spectrum was identical to that of the \u039e sample.\nThis removed the difference due to different mechanism for producing particles and\nanti-particles by protons, and ensured that \u01eb(cos\u03b8p\u039b ) was identical for both data\nsets. With \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b taken to be -0.292810 the difference in \u03b1\u039e \u03b1\u039b between the \u039e\u2212\n+\nand \u039e samples was determined by fitting R as a function of cos\u03b8p\u039b according to\n+\nequation (7). With approximately 70,000 \u039e\u2212 events along with equal number of \u039e\ndecays, the difference was \u22120.011 \u00b1 0.009. This implied that A\u039e\u039b was 0.019 \u00b1 0.015,\nwhich was consistent with the result obtained with the Hybrid Monte Carlo method.\nAs a check, another sample of \u039e\u2212 events was picked to repeat the measurement which\nyielded a result of 0.008 \u00b1 0.015 for A\u039e\u039b .\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nHyperCP (FNAL E871)\n\nHyperCP is a dedicated experiment designed to search for CP violation in charged-\u039e\u039b decay with about 100 times better sensitivity than E756.

Spectrometer of HyperCP.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, an 800-GeV proton beam with a typical intensity of 7.5\u00d7109\nper sec incidents on a 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 3 cm-long copper target at 0 mrad. The\nsecondary beam is bent through a 6.1 m-long shaped channel in the vertical plane by\na dipole magnet with a field of about 1.667 T. The momentum range of the selected\n\u039e\u2212 's is between 120 GeV/c and 220 GeV/c. The acceptance of this channel is about\n\n6\n\n\fa factor of two larger than the one in E756. Downstream of a 13 m-long evacuated\ndecay region is a spectrometer consisting of eight multiwire proportional chambers\nand two analysis magnets. There are about two times more anode planes and finer\nwire pitch than the E756 spectrometer, offering better reconstruction efficiency and\nbetter momentum resolution.a The trigger elements are a hadron calorimeter for\ndetecting particles with energy greater than 70 GeV at close to 100% efficiency, and\ntwo hodoscopes for finding opposite-sign charged tracks downstream of the analysis\nmagnets.\n+\nBuilding upon the technique developed in E756, \u039e events are collected by\nswitching to an approximately 2 cm-long copper target for sustaining a singles rate\ncomparable to that for the \u039e\u2212 run, and the polarities of the hyperon magnet and\nthe spectrometer magnets are reversed while keeping the trigger unchanged. The\n+\n\u039e\u2212 and \u039e modes are rotated every several hours to ensure adjacent runs having\nsimilar run conditions.\nThe experiment had a successful first run in the 1997 fixed-target program,\ncollecting about 30 billion \u039e triggers on tape.12 Due to an increase of the machine\nduty cycle, from about 40% to 50%, the DAQ had to be upgraded for the 1999 run.\nThis was realized by increased buffering, reduced event size through hardware data\ncompression, improved software, better layout of the DAQ architecture, and the use\nof the faster Exabyte 8705 tape drives. A typical DAQ bandwidth of 23 Mbyte/s,\nabout a factor of two improvement over the 1997 setup, and a live time of better\nthan 75% is achieved.\nOther improvements to the spectrometer, all of which resulted in better quality\ndata, are also implemented in the 1999 run. These include a detailed study of the\nrelative alignment of elements in the target area by beam scanning to ensure that\nthe targetting angle is close to 0 mrad and the target is centered at the entrance\nof the collimator, installing a new proton trigger hodoscope with a second set of\ncounters to improve efficiency determination, installing a segmented beam monitor\nfor handling the intense secondary beam, and running the downstream chambers\nwith CF4 -isobutane gas mixture to further reduce background hits.\nFig. 4 is a comparison of the 1997 and the 1999 data. Due to an adjustment in\nthe target position the \u039e momentum in the 1999 run is lowered, closer to the Monte\nCarlo prediction. The resolution of the \u039b\u03c0 invariant mass of the two runs is about\n1.6 MeV/c2 , which is about 0.8 MeV/c2 better than in E756.\nThe 1999 run is ongoing. By the end of the run, around the middle of January,\n2000, about a factor of two more data than the 1997 run is expected to be logged.\nThe combination of the two runs is expected to yield about 3 \u00d7 109 reconstructed\n+\n\u039e\u2212 decays and 0.75 \u00d7 109 \u039e events. This corresponds to a projected statistical\nsensitivity for the strange-baryon CP asymmetry of about 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which is\ncomparable to the proposed goal.\n\na The\n\nmuon system at the end of the spectrometer is used for studying rare decays.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nConclusion\n+\n\nBased on approximately 70,000 \u039e and 210,000 \u039e\u2212 decays the Fermilab E756 Collaboration has searched for CP violation in hyperon decay by measuring A\u039e\u039b . A\nresult of 0.012 \u00b1 0.014 was obtained. Systematic biases to the measurement, even\nwithout making any correction, have been shown to be insignificant down to the\n10\u22123 level.\nHyperCP has two successful runs, amassing probably the largest sample of\nstrange-baryon decays in the world.
