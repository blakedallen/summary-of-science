In electromagnetics (EM) and optical engineering, attention has been focused on photonic quasicrystals (PQCs), mainly inspired by the theory of \"aperiodic tilings\"1 , i.e., arrangements of polygonal shapes\ndevoid of any translational symmetry and capable of covering a plane without overlaps or gaps. Although aperiodic, these geometries can still exhibit long-range order\nand (high-order, \"noncrystallographic\") rotational symmetry in a local/statistical sense1 . A large body of PQC\nstudies, in applications ranging from lasers to superfocusing (see Ref. 3 for a recent review), have demonstrated\nthe possibility of obtaining similar effects as those exhibited by periodic photonic crystals (PCs), with intriguing\npotentials (e.g., bandgap control, lower/multiple operational frequencies, higher isotropy, richer defect-state\nspectrum, etc.) stemming from the additional degrees\nof freedom endowed by aperiodic order.\nOne application that still remains largely unexplored\nconcerns the possibility of achieving directive emission\nfrom embedded sources in PQCs. In periodic PCs, such\npossibility has been demonstrated in several investigations, and its theoretical aspects are well-understood.\nIn particular, directive emission has been achieved via\nthe use of microcavities4 (and, possibly, slight local\nchanges in the lattice period), or planar defects5,6,7 , as\nwell as in defect-free configurations8,9 by suitably designing the spatial dispersion properties. Periodic structures interpreted as artificial materials10 characterized\nby an effective relative permittivity lower than one have\nalso been proposed as effective devices to increase the\n\ndirectivity11,12,13 . Building up on the seminal work in\nRef. 14, the underlying phenomenology was also explained in terms of a leaky-wave (LW) model in Refs.\n11,12 (see also Sect. III B). In a similar framework, a\ndetailed analysis and parameterization capable of predicting quantitatively the directivity enhancement was\nderived in Ref. 15 for a periodic wire medium slab, in\nterms of very fast and slowly-attenuating LWs.\nFor PQCs, the lack of spatial periodicity (and related Bloch-type analytic tools) significantly complicates\nthe modeling and understanding of the involved phenomenologies (see, e.g., Ref. 16,17). In Ref. 18, we\npresented a preliminary study of the radiation from an\nelectric line-source embedded in a two-dimensional (2-D)\nfinite-size dielectric PQC slab with Penrose-type (5-fold\nsymmetric, quasiperiodic1 ) lattice. Results showed the\npossibility of achieving moderate directivity at three frequencies. Interestingly, the lowest operational frequency\nwas found to be moderately smaller than the corresponding value observed for a periodic PC slab with comparable size and number of rods, but the side-lobe level (SLL)\nwas still rather high. It is worth pointing out that the\nphysical interpretation of such results was not fully clear,\nalthough the possible applicability of LW-based models\nas in Ref. 15 was envisaged.\nIn this paper, building up on the preliminary study in\nRef. 18, we further elaborate upon this subject, by exploring some of the open issues related to: i) the possible\nextension to other tiling geometries, ii) the physical interpretation, and iii) the parametric optimization (in particular, the SLL reduction). In this framework, we consider\na different tiling geometry with 12-fold symmetry19,20 , recently explored in connection with superfocusing21,22,23 .\nVia a parametric study based on full-wave numerical\nsimulations4 , we find several instances of directive emission with low SLL, and address their physically-incisive\ninterpretation in terms of a LW model similar to that pro-\n\n\f2\ny\n\n\"local density of states\" (LDOS)27\n\n\u03c6\n\nPQC slab\n\nh\n\n\u03c1(rs , \u03c9) = 4Im{G(rs , rs ; \u03c9)},\n\nx\n\nL\n(a)\n\n(1)\n\nas well as the directivity\n2\u03c0|E f f (\u03c6, \u03c9)|2\n,\nD(\u03c6, \u03c9) = R 2\u03c0 fsf\n|Es (\u03c6, \u03c9)|2 d\u03c6\n0\n\u00d7\n\nthe normalized intensity\nS\u0304(\u03c6, \u03c9) =\n\n(c)\n(b)\n\nposed in Ref. 15, highlighting similarities and differences\nwith the periodic PC case.\nAccordingly, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II, we outline the problem geometry and\nthe observables utilized throughout. In Sect. III, we\nillustrate some representative results, address their physical interpretation, and summarize the results from our\nparametric studies. Finally, in Sect. IV, we provide some\nbrief concluding remarks and hints for future research.\n\nII.\n\nGEOMETRY AND OBSERVABLES\n\nAs in Ref. 18, we consider a 2-D (z-invariant) geometry\n(Fig. 1(a)) involving a PQC slab based on a dodecagonal\naperiodic tiling (in the x\u2212y plane), characterized by local\nand statistical 12-fold rotational symmetry, and generated via the so-called Stampfli inflation rules19 illustrated\nin Fig. 1(b). The construction, to be iterated up to the\ndesired tiling extension, starts from a dodecagon made\nof square and equilater-triangle tiles (thick\u221asolid line),\nwhich is first scaled-up by an inflation factor 3+2 (thick\ndashed line), and subsequently substituted at each vertex of the inflated version (see Refs. 20,21,22,23,24,25,26\nfor similar and different 12-fold symmetric PQCs). The\nPQC slab is then generated by cutting a rectangular portion of size L \u00d7 h from a suitably large tiling, and placing\ncircular dielectric rods (in vacuum) at the tile vertices; no\ndefects are assumed. The rods have relative permittivity\n\u000fr = 12 and radius r = 0.138a, with a being the lattice\nconstant (tile sidelength). A time-harmonic (exp(\u2212i\u03c9t))\nelectric line-source is placed in vacuum nearby the slab\ncenter (see the zoom in Fig. 1(c)).\nAs meaningful observables, we consider the normalized\n\n|Esf f (\u03c6, \u03c9)|2\nff\n(\u03c6, \u03c9)|2\n|Es0\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nand the SLL\n\u039b(\u03c9) =\n\nFIG. 1: (a): Problem geometry.

The above observables, equal to\none in the absence of the PQC, are computed via a\nwell-established full-wave numerical technique based on\na multipolar Fourier-Bessel expansion4 . In order to facilitate comparisons with previously published results, we\nalso consider the 3dB beamwidth \u2206\u03c63dB , defined as the\nangular region where the radiation is higher than -3dB\nof the maximum, i.e. (for a symmetric radiation pattern\nwith main lobe at \u03c6 = 90o ),\n\u221a\n|Esf f (\u03c0/2 + \u2206\u03c63dB /2, \u03c9)| = |Esf f (\u03c0/2, \u03c9)|/ 2.\n(5)\nIn the 2-D scalar scenario of interest here, the LDOS\nadmits an intuitive interpretation as the normalized total power (per unit-length along the z direction) radiated by the line-source18 , and represents a meaningful\nbandgap indicator, whereas the directivity and the normalized intensity are indicative of the angular confinement and power density enhancement (as compared to\nvacuum) of the radiated far-field. Attention is focused\non achieving broadside (\u03c6 = 90o ) directivity, although\nthe structure also radiates into the y < 0 half-space.\n\nIII.\n\nDIRECTIVE EMISSION FROM A\nDODECAGONAL PQC SLAB\nA.\n\nRepresentative Results\n\nFigures 2(a)\u20132(c) show the observables in (1)\u2013(3) as\na function of the normalized frequency a/\u03bb0 (with \u03bb0\ndenoting the vacuum wavelength). From the LDOS response (Fig. 2(a)), one can identify a main bandgap (represented by low values of \u03c1) and several minor dips. Potentially interesting configurations are characterized by\n\n\f3\n\nS(\u03c6=90\u00b0, \u03c9 ) (dB)\n\nD(\u03c6=90\u00b0, \u03c9 ) (dB)\n\nlog10 \u03c1(x=y=0, \u03c9)\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n15\n\n(b)\n\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n20\n\n(c)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nnormalized frequency a/\u03bb0\n\nFIG. 2: Normalized LDOS (a), broadside directivity (b), and\nbroadside normalized intensity (c), as a function of the normalized frequency a/\u03bb0 , for a dodecagonal PQC slab (L =\n97.8a, h = 4a, 435 rods, cf.

(a), (b), (c): a/\u03bb0 = 0.239, 0.317, and 0.736, respectively.\n\nhigh-amplitude peak coincidences in the broadside directivity (Fig. 2(b)) and normalized intensity (Fig. 2(c)).\nThese coincidences correspond to situations where the\npeaks in the radiated power (Fig. 2(c)) are likely accompanied by radiation patterns with narrow beams, and\nthus high directivity, in the \u03c6 = 90o direction. The vertical dashed lines mark three such representative configurations, whose radiation patterns (normalized |Esf f (\u03c6, \u03c9)|2\nvs. \u03c6) are displayed in Figs. 3(a)\u20133(c). In all three\ncases, one should observe the narrow peak at broadside\naccompanied by sidelobes of lower level. It should be emphasized that, as clearly visible from the sharp peaks in\nFig. 2, the above configurations are intrinsically narrowband. At the lowest frequency (a/\u03bb0 = 0.239), the directivity is about 9dB (with 3dB beamwidth \u2206\u03c63dB = 4o ),\nand the SLL (Fig. 3(a)) is moderately high (\u039b \u2248 \u22126\ndB), comparable with the values observed in Ref. 18\nfor a Penrose-type PQC. However, at the higher frequencies a/\u03bb0 = 0.317, 0.736, the radiation patterns\nlook considerably cleaner, with directivities of 13.7dB\n(\u2206\u03c63dB = 2.35o ) and 10.4dB (\u2206\u03c63dB = 3.44o ), respectively, and the SLL reaches values \u223c \u221210dB that may\nbe acceptable in many practical applications. As compared with the Penrose tiling geometry in Ref. 18, the\ndodecagonal PQC here turns out to provide comparable\noperating frequencies and lower SLL.\nIt is worth noticing that direct comparisons of above\nresults with the periodic PC cases in Refs. 4,5,6,7,8,9\nshould be addressed cautiously, in view of the differences\nin the underlying radiation mechanisms and related parametric ranges. In this connection, we highlight that the\nconfigurations in Refs. 4,5,6,7,8,9 are based on either\ndefected or defect-free thick structures, which essentially\nexploit the spatial filtering capabilities of PCs around\nband-edge frequencies in order to achieve directive emission. Conversely, our configuration is based on a defectfree thin-slab geometry, and, as one can observe from Fig.\n2, the operational frequencies are not necessarily close to\nthe band edges. As a reference for qualitative comparisons, we observe from Ref. 8 that the radiation pattern\nproduced by a line-source embedded in a defect-free periodic PC thick-slab made of 24 \u00d7 16 alumina (\u000fr = 9.61)\nrods of radius r = 0.136a (in the experiment, it was chosen a = 1.1cm and r = 1.5mm), at a frequency of 13.21\nGHz (i.e., a/\u03bb0 = 0.484), would exhibit a 3dB beamwidth\n\u2206\u03c63dB = 8o , and SLL values \u223c \u221220dB. Therefore, from\na qualitative viewpoint (and bearing in mind the aforementioned parametric differences), the performance exhibited by our proposed configuration (at the higher frequencies) turns out to be comparable, with moderately\nsmaller beamwidth (higher directivity) and higher SLL.\nWe also would like to point out, that in general, the\ndirectivity of thick structures is governed by geometricaloptics ultra-refraction phenomena, as explained in Ref.\n13 for a metamaterial with a rectangular lattice and in\nRef. 28 for its equivalent homogenized low-permittivity\nmaterial. On the other hand, thin slabs are able to provide higher directivitiy because the physical mechanism\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Internal field intensity maps pertaining\nto the radiation patterns in Fig. 3 (due to symmetry, only the\nx > 0 slab-half is shown).

For\nslabs made of periodic structures, it has been observed15\nthat the field excited by a source and evaluated at a certain distance from the vacuum-slab interface is mainly\nrepresented by a LW mode contribution. Such distance\nfrom the interface is required in order to observe a homogeneous field distribution that is not strictly related to\nthe local structure details described by evanescent waves\n(associated with high-order Bloch harmonics) that decay\naway from the interface. Along the interface, at a fixed y,\na general description of the field in terms of algebraicallydecaying spatial waves and guided (bounded and leaky)\nmodes is given in Ref. 14, Sect. III of Ref. 15, and\nSect. V of Ref. 30. In certain structures (see, e.g.,\nthose shown in Ref. 30), the spatial wave is the dominant contribution. However, in other cases (which can be\nproperly designed15 ), the spatial wave is comparatively\nweakly excited, and the near-field Es at an equivalent\naperture close to the vacuum-PC interface is therefore\ndominated by a LW mode with complex propagation constant kLW = \u03b2 + i\u03b1, i.e.,\n\n1E-3\n\nEs (x, y) \u223c E0 (y) exp (i\u03b2|x|) exp (\u2212\u03b1|x|) ,\n\n(6)\n\n1E-4\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nx/a\n\nFIG. 5: Field-magnitude cut at y = 2.03a for the configuration in Fig. 4(c) (corresponding to the radiation pattern in\nFig. 3(c)). Note the semi-log scale and the linear fit (shown\ndashed), which highlight the exponential field decay along x.\n\nis slightly different, as explained in Ref. 28. There, it\nis shown that, because of the small thickness, a (single) dominant LW can be excited. In Ref. 28 and in\nSect. III-D of Ref. 29, the two mechanisms (geometricaloptics-based for thick structures, and LW-based for thin\nstructures) have been quantitatively compared, showing\nthat the latter is capable of yielding a higher directivity.\n\nB.\n\nPhysical Interpretation\n\nIn this Section, we show that the radiation mechanism\nunderlying the observed results is related to the excitation of a LW that travels along the PQC slab. A LW is a\nguided wave that radiates continuously across a guiding\nstructure while propagating along it; the power leakage\nresults in an exponential attenuation of the wave as it\npropagates along the structure, even in the absence of\nlosses.\nThe radiation mechanism of our PQC thin slab turns\nout to be somehow similar to those illustrated in Refs.\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the phase propagation constant, and the attenuation constant \u03b1 describes the exponential decay along\nx. If the attenuation constant \u03b1 is much smaller than\nthe free space wavenumber k0 = 2\u03c0/\u03bb0 , the field at the\nvacuum-PC interface is sustained for a long distance, extending for several wavelengths. If also the phase propagation constant \u03b2 is much smaller than the free space\nwavenumber (i.e., \u03b2 \u001c k0 ), we derive that the field at the\ninterface exhibits an essentially equi-phase profile, which\nis an important aspect for high-directivity radiators. It\nis important to note that close to the vacuum-PC interface (at distances smaller or comparable with the lattice\nconstant) the field oscillates around the average value\nrepresented by (6) because of the effects produced by the\nnearby scatterers (for periodic structures, these oscillations are represented by high-order Bloch harmonics).\nAs anticipated, another important outcome of this\nstudy is the evidence that LWs can be supported by a\nPQC slab as well. In order to gain such evidence, we\nshow that the field at the vacuum-PQC interface can be\ndescribed by the simplified model in (6). As a first example, Fig. 4 shows the intensity field-maps inside the PQC\nslab at the three representative frequencies, from which\nthe presence of a modal structure is clearly visible.\nThe LW propagation constant kLW is very useful to parameterize the characteristics of the radiated field, which\ncan be readily computed via Fourier transform of the LW\naperture field in (6).

Nevertheless, we can show that the observed radiation features are consistent with the predictions of a simplified LW model as in (6)\u2013(9). To this aim,\nfor the operational frequency a/\u03bb0 = 0.736, Fig. 5 shows\na cut of the field magnitude at an aperture y = 2.03a\nclose to the vacuum-PQC interface. Thanks to the semilog scale and the dashed linear fit in the plot, an exponential decay is clearly observable, with irregular oscillations around the linear fit ascribable to the inherent local\nstructure of the PQC slab interface. The LW attenuation constant \u03b1 can readily be estimated from the slope\nof the log-scale linear fit, yielding \u03b1 \u2248 0.099/a, which is\nconsistent (\u03b1 \u001c k0 ) with the observed high directivity15 .\nDue to the aforementioned lack of a dispersion equation,\nwe are not able to compute \u03b2.

This is confirmed by the comparison,\nshown in Fig. 6, between the actual radiation pattern\n(cf. Fig. 3(c)) and the LW prediction from (8), which\nevidences a good agreement in the angular region near\nthe maximum; the two curves are almost coincident over\na 5 dB dynamic range. From a more quantitative viewpoint, Eq. (9) estimates the corresponding beamwidth\n\u2206\u03c63dB = 3.46o , in excellent agreement with the actual\nvalue of 3.44o . We can thus conclude that the observed\nradiation properties are indeed consistent with the predictions of the simplified LW model in (6)\u2013(9), and hence\na LW with the appropriate characteristics (namely, with\namplitude and phase profiles varying on a much larger\nlength scale than the vacuum wavelength) is mainly responsible for shaping the main beam of the pattern.\nAnother interesting feature offered by the LW parameterization is the information about the transverse size\n(along the x direction) that is necessary to produce a\nrequired beam radiation. Once the beamwidth \u2206\u03c63dB\nis specified, the required \u03b1 = \u03b2 attenuation constant is\nthen found via (9). From (6), one can then determine\nhow large the structure needs to be for having a negligible field at its edges, so that truncation effects would not\nproduce pattern distortion in the main lobe region.\n\nC.\n\nSummary of Parametric Studies\n\nFrom the above physical interpretation, one gathers\nthat directive low-SLL radiation can be achieved by exciting a proper LW mode in the PQC slab. In order to\ngain further insight into the role of the various parameters involved in the excitation process, we carried out\na comprehensive set of parametric studies, whose main\nresults can be summarized as follows.\n\u2022 The symmetric-cut configuration in Fig. 1 turns\nout to be the best suited for exciting a LW radiating at broadside. Different cuts from the original dodecagonal tiling, where either the x\u2212 or\ny\u2212symmetry is broken, can be utilized for pointing\nthe main beam in different directions (as already\nobserved in Ref. 18).\n\n\f6\n\u2022 Increasing the slab thickness, we also observed variations in the radiation characteristics, though without the clearly-predictable behavior observable in\nthe periodic PC case11,12,13,15 . In the periodic PC\ncase, it is known that increasing too much the slab\nthickness, other LW modes may appear and deteriorate the radiation pattern. In this connection, it\nshould also be noticed that, unlike in periodic PCs,\nthickness changes in PQC slabs intrinsically involve\ntermination changes, and so the two effects (thickness and termination) are not easily discernible.\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\u2022 The rods radius value (r = 0.138a) utilized\nthroughout was arrived at via parameter scanning.\nSlight departures from this value (e.g., r = 0.15a)\nwere observed to yield moderate deterioration in\nthe SLL, up to the complete disappearance of the\ndirective response at the higher frequencies.\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a study of the radiation properties of line-sources embedded in 2-D finitesize defect-free dielectric dodecagonal PQC slabs. Via a\ncomprehensive full-wave numerical study, we have identified certain parametric configurations which give rise\nto directive low-SLL broadside radiation. These results extend to a different PQC geometry our previous\nobservations18 , confirming the possibility of obtaining directive low-SLL radiation at multiple frequencies. Moreover, we have shown that also for the case of aperiodicallyordered PQCs the observed radiation characteristics are\nconsistent with the predictions of a LW-based simplified\nmodel, and have explored the role of the key geometrical\nparameters.\n\n\u2022 The source position was found to be a rather effective parameter for adjusting the LW excitation,\nso as to optimize the radiation pattern. As an example, the radiation pattern in Fig. 3(a) was optimized by moving the source vertically (so as to\npreserve the x-symmetry and, hence, the broadside radiation) via parameter scanning. Figure 7\nshows the optimized radiation pattern, which represents the best tradeoff response (D = 15.5dB,\nS\u0304 = 14.8dB, and \u039b = \u221212dB) observed for a dodecagonal PQC in our study.\n\nThe above results, and their LW-based physical interpretation, pave the way for a systematic parameterization and design of directive radiators based on PQC slabs.\nIn this framework, current and future investigations are\naimed at a deeper understanding of the modal structure\nsupported by PQC slabs, and the refinement of the LWbased modeling, so as to come up with more quantitative\ndesign rules. Also of interest is the experimental verification of the phenomenon, as well as further studies of\ndifferent configurations (e.g., air-hole-type) and PQC geometries.\n\nElectronic address: vgaldi@unisannio.it\nM.
