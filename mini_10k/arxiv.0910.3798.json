Physical topologies describe how\ndifferent sites are coupled to each other, whereas logical\ntopologies refer to the flow of information between the\nvarious sites in a particular network. The simplest logical\ntopology one may consider is the so-called point-to-point\n(PP) topology where one node (source) is connected directly to another (destination) node. The logical network\ntopology is not necessarily the same as the physical layout, since the former is bound to the protocols used for\ncommunication. For instance, there might exist intermediate physical connections between the source and the\ndestination nodes that do not change the PP character\nof the logical topology, i.e., any message originating from\nthe source is intended for the destination node only.\nA direct generalization of the point-to-point logical\ntopology to multiple nodes is the so called bus topology,\nwhich enables a number of logical nodes to communicate\nusing the same shared media. Physically speaking, various nodes are connected to a common wire (known as\nbackbone or bus). Whenever a node wants to communicate with another node, it sends the message over the\ncommon channel. In contrast to the PP topology, the\nmessage is visible and, in principle, accessible by all the\nlogical nodes, although the intended recipient is actually\nthe one that accepts and processes the message [2].\nRecently, many of the questions typically addressed in\nconventional networks have been transferred to a quantum setting, where information is imprinted onto the\nstate of quantum systems, and the quantum wires are\nfully compatible with the hardware in a particular quantum computing implementation [3]. Typically, quantum\nnetworks are discrete, consisting of a number of coupled\nquantum objects (physical nodes), a subset of which can\nbe the logical nodes. Passive quantum networks, where\nthe nodes have fixed energies and are permanently coupled, are of particular interest since they do not require\nany external control associated with the application of\nmultiple gates and/or measurements. In this spirit, var-\n\nious Hamiltonians have been proposed which allow for\nPST from one node to another [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nIn such a PP logical topology, the other nodes provide\nthe backbone (or bus), for the communication between\nthe source and the destination nodes. The excitation is\nshared among all of the nodes throughout its evolution,\nand it is only after a well-defined time that it can be\nlocalized with high probability at the destination node.\nThis paper goes beyond PP logical topologies, placing\nthe problem of PST in a much broader context involving\npassive networks with logical bus topology. Many logical\nnodes need to communicate with each other using the\nsame shared media, and our task is to engineer Hamiltonians, which are capable of transferring successively a\nquantum state from the source node, to each one of the\nother logical nodes, in a perfect and deterministic manner\n[12]. This is in contrast to previous studies on multiport\nnetwork topologies [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] where some kind\nof external control is required, to direct selectively the\nsignal to one of the destination nodes only. In our case,\nthe passive network evolves under the influence of a single time-independent Hamiltonian and, in contrast to PP\ntopology, the signal is accessible by all the logical nodes;\nalbeit at different times.\nIn the following section we formulate the problem under consideration, and describe briefly the methodology\nwe adopt throughout this work.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nThe system under consideration pertains to a network\nconsisting of d permanently coupled physical sites labeled\nby {0, 1, . . . , d \u2212 1} \u2261 Sd , and let L denote the set of logical nodes with L \u2286 Sd . The label that we give to each\nnode is arbitrary and does not necessarily correspond to\nany physical ordering of the network. For example, the\nphysical nodes 0 and d \u2212 1 could be directly coupled to\neach other physically. Similarly, if our network was arranged in a linear chain, then the physical nodes 0 and\nd \u2212 1 need not be the first and last nodes respectively.\nTo recapitulate our formalism, it is sufficient to restrict\nthis section to PP logical networks setting L = {ls , ld },\n\n\f2\nwith ls(d) \u2208 Sd denoting the source(destination) nodes,\nrespectively. All the nodes are in the ground state |\u2298i\u2297d\nand at time t = 0 the source node is prepared in some\nstate |\u03c8i. The problem of PST pertains to the quest of\nHamiltonians, which allow for the transfer of the state to\nthe destination node ld with unit efficiency after a welldefined time \u03c4 .\nDepending on the particular implementation under\nconsideration, the state may involve various degrees of\nfreedom besides the position of the excitation (e.g., spin,\nangular momentum, etc). Following previous work in the\nfield [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], we assume that all of these\nadditional degrees of freedom are preserved throughout\nthe evolution of the system. Moreover, we are interested\nin Hamiltonians which preserve the total number of excitations in the system, and we thus focus on the transfer of a single excitation from the source to the destination node, within the one-excitation Hilbert subspace.\nThe corresponding (computational) basis is denoted by\n{|\u03bai | \u03ba \u2208 Sd }, where |\u03bai indicates the presence of the excitation at the site \u03ba, i.e., |\u03bai \u2261 |\u2298i\u2297(\u03ba\u22121) |\u03c8i|\u2298i\u2297(d\u2212\u03ba) .\nThe problem is thus reduced to the quest of PST Hamiltonians, which perform the transformation |ls i \u2192 |ld i at\ntime t = \u03c4 .\nIt has been shown [20] that, for a large class of PST\nHamiltonians, the associated unitary evolution \u00db leads\nto a permutation matrix at time \u03c4 that permutes the\nsource and destinations nodes i.e.,\n\u00db (\u03c4 ) \u2261 e\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 = \u03a0\u0302,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a0\u0302 = |ld ihls | + \u03a0\u0302\u2032 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nis a permutation in the single excitation sector i.e., the\nsubmatrix \u03a0\u2032 is also a permutation in the computational\nbasis. For instance, it is known that a one-dimensional\n(1D) spin chain with a judiciously chosen XY Hamiltonian, can be used to perfectly transfer a state from one\nend of the chain to the other [3, 7, 8]. The success of\nthis PST protocol is due to the fact P\nthat the Hamiltonian generates the permutation \u03a0\u0302 = n |nihd \u2212 n| [20].\nFor a network with d sites and PP logical topology, there\nare (d \u2212 1)! different permutations of the form (2), and\nfor each one of these one can construct the corresponding class of Hamiltonians satisfying Eq. (1) (and are thus\nsuitable for PST between the prescribed nodes).\nIn general, \u03a0\u0302 canPbe decomposed into disjoint cycles\n\u03a0\u0302i [21], i.e., \u03a0\u0302 =\ni \u03a0\u0302i , and let \u03a9i denote the set of\nsites (and thus basis states) permuted by \u03a0\u0302i . The sets\n{\u03a9i } are disjoint, while the dimensions of the support of\neach cycle \u03a0\u0302i is the cardinality of the corresponding set\ndenoted by di . The spectrum of each cycle \u03a0\u0302i is nonde(\u03bb )\ngenerate and let |vi n i be the eigenvector corresponding\n(\u03bb )\n(\u03bb )\nto an eigenvalue \u03bbn where \u03a0\u0302i |vi n i = \u03bbn |vi n i, with\n1 X \u03b6\u03ba\n(\u03bb )\n|vi n i = \u221a\n(3)\n\u03bb |\u03bai,\ndi \u03ba\u2208\u03a9 n\ni\n\nand\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\n\u03bbn = exp i2\u03c0\ndi\n\nn \u2208 Zdi \u2261 {0, 1, . . . , di \u2212 1}.(4)\n\nfor\n\nThe elements of the set \u03a9i are considered to be arranged\nin ascending order, and \u03b6\u03ba \u2208 Zdi is the position of the\nelement \u03ba \u2208 \u03a9i . Hence, for the permutation \u03a0\u0302 the\neigenvalue \u03bbn corresponds to \u03b7\u03bbn distinct eigenvectors\n(\u03bb )\n{|vi n i}, with i running only on the various cycles having \u03bbn in common.\nA class of PST Hamiltonians that satisfy Eq. (1) is of\nthe form\n\u03b7\u03bbn\n1 XX\n(a)\n(a) (a)\nHx =\n\u03b5\u03bbn |y\u03bbn ihy\u03bbn |,\n\u03c4\na=1\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bbn\n\n(a)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u03bbn\n(1)\n\n(a)\n\n= \u2212 arg (\u03bbn ) + 2\u03c0x\u03bbn and x \u2208 Zd \u2261\n\n(\u03b7\n\n)\n\n(\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\n)\n\n(a)\n\n{(x\u03bb0 , . . . , x\u03bb0\u03bb0 ; x\u03bb1 , . . . , x\u03bb1\u03bb1 ; . . .) | x\u03bbn \u2208 Z}. For a\n(a)\n\ngiven eigenvalue \u03bbn , the \u03b7\u03bbn distinct vectors {|y\u03bbn i} form\nan orthonormal basis for the corresponding subspace and\nare of the form\nX (\u03bb ) (\u03bb )\n(a)\n(6)\n\u03b2a,in |vi n i,\n|y\u03bbn i =\ni\n\nP (\u03bbn )\u2217 (\u03bbn )\n(\u03bb )\n\u03b2a\u2032 ,i = \u03b4a,a\u2032 .

(6).\nThe condition (1) is rather restrictive since, in general,\none may derive PST Hamiltonians which do not lead to\npermutations at time \u03c4 , but rather to other unitary operations. Despite this fact, it has been demonstrated that\nthe present theoretical framework is suitable for engineering of passive networks, and many known PST Hamiltonians satisfy condition (1) [20]. The permutation matrix\n(2) guarantees that the net effect of the evolution (1) is\nthe transfer of the excitation from the source to the destination node at time \u03c4 . The present formalism has the\nadvantage that we do not need to make any assumptions\nabout the physical topology of the network. Instead infinitely many Hamiltonians suitable for PST can be specified within the present theoretical framework, and this\nenables us to find the most suitable Hamiltonian for a\ngiven physical realization and topology. Finally, there is\n\n\f3\nno requirement for the initial overall state of the network\n(minus the source node) to have a specific form i.e., to be\npure or mixed state [22]. Nevertheless, the source node\nis considered to be initially decorrelated from the rest of\nthe the network, which can be prepared in any state [24].\nMoreover, for the sake of simplicity, throughout this work\nwe assume that all the nodes but the source, are initially\nin their ground state.\nWe turn now to discuss the problem of PST in the\ncontext of logical networks with bus topology. In the\nclassical theory of networks [1] one often assumes that\nthe logical nodes have an equivalence property that is,\nno matter which logical node the signal starts at, it will\nbe transferred about the predetermined logical network.\nSimilarly, throughout this work we focus on passive quantum networks with equivalent logical nodes, and thus the\nPST (flow of information) is restricted within the predetermined logical network, irrespective of the source of the\nstate. In the following section we investigate the conditions under which multiple point-to-point PST links can\nbe concatenated to yield PST between multiple nodes.\n\nIII.\n\nCONCATENATION OF PP PST LINKS\n\nSuppose we are interested in transferring an excitation\nbetween three different physical sites. For the sake of\nconvenience we shall label these three logical nodes as\n{l0 , l1 , l2 }, regardless of their physical proximity. Let us\nalso assume that we have solved the problem of pairwise\nPST, i.e., we have two Hamiltonians \u01251 and \u01252 , which\ngenerate the unitary transformations \u00db1 and \u00db2 , respectively, such that \u00dbj perfectly transfers the state from the\nnode l0 to lj , i.e.,\n\u00dbj |l0 i = ei\u03c6j |lj i, for \u03c6j \u2208 R.\n\n(9)\n\nOur task is to investigate the conditions under which\nwe can define a single time-independent Hamiltonian \u0124,\nwhich acts on the entire network and generates both of\nthe unitaries at different times, i.e., exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c4j ) = \u00dbj .\nIn this case, the two unitaries (or else the corresponding\nPP PST links) are compatible, and can be used as building blocks for the design of passive networks with more\ninvolved logical topologies pertaining to the prescribed\nnodes {lj }.\nThe following theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the compatibility of two unitary operators.\nTheorem 1. Two different unitary operators \u00db1 and \u00db2\nare compatible if and only if\n(i) There exist \u03c41 , \u03c42 \u2208 (0, \u221e) : \u00db1\u03c42 = \u00db2\u03c41 for \u03c41 6=\n\u03c42 , and for all t \u2208 (0, \u221e) \u00db1t 6= \u00db2t .\n(ii) The two unitary operators commute, i.e. [\u00db1 , \u00db2 ] =\n0.\n\nProof of Theorem 1. We begin by showing that these\ntwo conditions are sufficient for the two unitary operators to be compatible. We first assume that we have two\nHamiltonians \u01251 and \u01252 that generate two unitary operators \u00db1 and \u00db2 , which satisfy conditions (i) and (ii).\nCondition (ii) ensures that the two unitaries have a common eigenbasis (with eigenprojectors {\u00cai }) and can be\nthus simultaneously diagonalized i.e.,\nX\nX\n(10)\n\u03b3i \u00cai .\n\u03b1i \u00cai , \u00db2 =\n\u00db1 =\ni\n\ni\n\nCondition (i) then implies that (\u03b1i )\u03c42 = (\u03b3i )\u03c41 for all\ni, and setting \u03b1i = \u03bb\u03c4i 1 we also obtain \u03bb\u03c4i 2 = \u03b3i . We\nP\ncan now define the normal operator \u00db = i \u03bbi \u00cai , where\n\u00db \u03c41 = \u00db1 and \u00db \u03c42 = \u00db2 . In order for the operator \u00db to\nbe unitary we must have that |\u03bbi |2 = 1 for all i. In our\ncase, however, this is ensured by the equalities |\u03bbi |2\u03c41 =\n|ai |2 = 1 and |\u03bbi |2\u03c42 = |bi |2 = 1, which enable us to\nchoose |\u03bbi | = 1. Recalling that all unitary operators can\nbe expressed in the form \u00db = exp(\u2212i\u0124t), where \u0124 is\nHermitian, it is clear that \u0124 will act as a Hamiltonian\non the entire network, generating the two unitaries \u00db1\nand \u00db2 at times \u03c41 and \u03c42 , respectively.\nWe shall now show that if two different unitary operators \u00dbj can be generated from a single Hamiltonian \u0124,\nthen conditions (i) and (ii) will be satisfied. Let \u03c41 and\n\u03c42 be two different times and define \u00dbj = exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c4j ),\nwhere j = 1, 2. By a trivial application of the standard operator ordering theorems [25], we find that\nexp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c41 \u03c42 ) = \u00db1\u03c42 = \u00db2\u03c41 . If \u03c41 = \u03c42 , then \u00db1 = \u00db2\n(which contradicts our initial assumption) and thus we\nmust have \u03c41 6= \u03c42 . It is obvious that no time t can exist\nsuch that \u00db1t = \u00db2t for \u00db1 6= \u00db2 . Condition (i) is therefore\na necessary condition for the two unitary transformations\nto be compatible. Finally, condition (ii) is also a necessary condition since [exp(\u2212i\u03c41 \u0124), exp(\u2212i\u03c42 \u0124)] = 0.\nThe previous discussion pertains to networks with\nthree logical nodes {l0 , l1 , l2 } and the PST from l0 to\nlj occurs at well-defined time \u03c4j , with \u03c42 > \u03c41 . It is\nstraightforward to extent the notion of compatibility to\nlarger sets of unitary operators {\u00dbj }, and thus to generalize the previous discussion to passive networks with\n|L| > 3 logical nodes.\nCorollary 1. The unitary operators of a given set\n{\u00dbj | \u00dbj 6= \u00dbj \u2032 for j 6= j \u2032 and j, j \u2032 \u2208 N} are compatible iff any pair of these operators satisfies the conditions\nof theorem 1.\nIf the compatibility conditions are satisfied, there\nexists a single Hamiltonian to implement the unitary\noperators {\u00dbj } at well-defined distinct times {\u03c4j \u2208\n(0, \u221e) | \u03c4j > \u03c4j \u2032 for j > j \u2032 }.\nThe above theorem and corollary are very general and\napplicable to various kinds of PP PST links, including the\nschemes of Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. To gain, however, further insight into the problem of concatenating a\n\n\f4\nnumber of given PST links, and the possible limitations\none may face while looking for solutions, we have to become more specific. To this end, we assume that one of\nthe unitaries, let us say \u00db2 , is a permutation matrix \u03a0\u0302\nthat permutes the logical nodes l0 and l2 . In any case,\nthis choice cannot be considered very restrictive since\nmany known PST schemes can be obtained in this context [20]. The network is initially in the state |l0 i and in\norder for \u03a0\u0302 and \u00db1 to be compatible, they must satisfy\nthe conditions of theorem 1. As we will see now, however,\nthe structure of the permutation \u03a0\u0302 (i.e., whether or not\nit can be decomposed into smaller closed cycles) implies\nadditional constraints on the logical networks one may\nconsider.\nSuppose that \u03a0\u0302 can be decomposed into closed subcycles {\u03a0\u0302j } that cannot be decomposed further. By definition, \u03a0\u0302 permutes the nodes l0 and l2 and thus, these\nsites must belong to the same cycle that we denote by \u03a0\u03020 .\nThe question is whether l1 must also belong to the same\ncycle, in order for the PST within the logical network\n{l0 , l1 , l2 } to be possible.\nTheorem 2. Let \u0124 be a Hamiltonian governing the evolution of an excitation in a passive quantum network,\nsuch that \u03a0\u0302 = exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c42 ), where \u03a0\u0302 permutes the nodes\nl0 and l2 . To achieve PST to an intermediate site l1 at\nan earlier time \u03c41 < \u03c42 , l1 must belong to the same closed\ncycle of \u03a0\u0302 as l0 and l2 .\nBefore we prove this statement let us discuss its physical implications. If we want to perfectly transfer the state\nto several different logical nodes at different times, then\nall of these logical nodes must belong to the same cycle\nof \u03a0\u0302. The choice of logical nodes thus places a restriction on our choice of \u03a0\u0302, and vice-versa. This will in turn\nimpose physical constraints on the type of Hamiltonians\nthat one can derive (e.g., see [26]). On the other hand,\nfor the design of a universal bus, that transfers the excitation successively to every node of the network, \u03a0\u0302 must\nbe a one-cycle permutation (see also Sec. IV A). Theorem 2 also implies that we cannot achieve PST between\ntwo physical nodes that belong to different cycles of \u03a0\u0302.\nThis means that the probability of finding the state at\na node that is not in the same cycle as the source node\nl0 will be strictly less than one. A question therefore is\nwhether the transfer can be achieved with high probability. The following observation, which is proved in the\nappendix A, partially answers this question.\nObservation 1. Let two logical nodes l0 and l1 belong\nto different closed cycles \u03a0\u03020 and \u03a0\u03021 respectively, of a\npermutation \u03a0\u0302. It can be shown that\nPl1 (t) \u2264\n\n1\n2\n(min{d0 , d1 }) ,\nd0 d1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere dj is the dimension of the support of \u03a0\u0302j , and\nPm (t) = |hm|\u00db (t)|l0 i|2 is the probability for the excitation to occupy the node m at time t, where \u00db (t) = e\u2212i\u0124t\nand \u00db (\u03c4 ) = \u03a0\u0302, for some \u03c4 > 0.\n\nInequality (11) provides a useful upper bound (strictly\nless than 1) on the probability Pl1 (t) only when d0 6= d1 .\nOn the other hand, one may expect Pl1 (t) = 1 only for\nd0 = d1 , but our numerical investigations show that even\nin this case the probability is generally much less than 1.\nProof of Theorem 2. Assuming that the nodes l0 and\nl1 belong to different cycles (denoted by \u03a0\u03020 and \u03a0\u03021 , respectively), and given the existence of \u03a0\u0302 : |l0 i \u2192 |l2 i,\nwe will prove by contradiction that there exists no unitary operator \u00db1 which is compatible with \u03a0\u0302 and satisfies\n\u00db1 |l0 i = ei\u03c61 |l1 i. It is sufficient, for our purposes, to focus on the case of d0 = d1 since, according to inequality\n(11), we cannot achieve PST from l0 to l1 when d0 6= d1 .\nSuppose that there exists such a unitary operator \u00db1\nwhich satisfies Eq. (9), and can thus be expressed in the\nform\n\u00db1 = ei\u03c61 |l1 ihl0 | + \u0174 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere unitarity of \u00db1 implies that \u0174 \u2020 |l1 i = 0 and\n\u0174 |l0 i = 0. In some sense, this is a first guess of \u00db1 ,\nthat we can refine further using the fact that \u03a0\u0302 and \u00db1\nare compatible. According to theorem\n\u0010 1, this\n\u0011 means that\n[\u00db1 , \u03a0\u0302] = 0, which implies that \u00db1 \u03a0\u03020 |l0 i = ei\u03c61 \u03a0\u03021 |l1 i.\nIn view of this additional\n\u0011 can\n\u0010 information, Eq. (12)\nbe rewritten as \u00db1 = ei\u03c61 |l1 ihl0 | + \u03a0\u03021 |l1 ihl0 |\u03a0\u0302\u20200 + \u01741 ,\n\nwhere \u01741\u2020 |l1 i = \u01741\u2020 \u03a0\u03021 |l1 i = 0 and \u01741 |l0 i = \u01741 \u03a0\u03020 |l0 i =\n0. Given, however, that [\u00db1 , \u03a0\u0302] = 0, we also have that U1\ncommutes with any power of \u03a0\u0302. Hence, in general, for\nd0 \u2265 1 we can perform d0 iterations of the above refinement with the jth iteration pertaining to [\u00db1 , \u03a0\u0302j ] = 0.\nThe final result is\n\u00db1 = e\n\ni\u03c61\n\ndX\n0 \u22121\nj=0\n\n\u03a0\u0302j1 |l1 ihl0 |(\u03a0\u0302\u20200 )j + \u0174d0 \u22121 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u0174d\u20200 \u22121 |\u03be1 i = 0 and \u0174d0 \u22121 |\u03be0 i = 0, \u2200|\u03be0(1) i \u2208 \u03a90(1) .\nSo, in order for the nonsingular \u00db1 to commute with \u03a0\u0302,\nthe map \u00db1 : \u03a90 7\u2192 \u03a91 must be bijective.\nOn the other hand, [\u00db1 , \u03a0\u0302] = 0 implies that \u00db1 and \u03a0\u0302\nare simultaneously diagonalizable, and we can construct\na common eigenbasis. The permutation \u03a0\u0302 has a degenerate spectrum since, by definition, it consists of several, let\nus say a, cycles {\u03a0i }, with \u03a00 and \u03a01 involving the nodes\nl0 and l1 , respectively. All the cycles have at least one\n(\u03bb )\neigenvalue in common, namely \u03bb0 = 1, and let |vi 0 i be\nthe corresponding eigenvector for cycle \u03a0\u0302i , given by Eq.\n(3) for n = 0. In the subspace that is spanned by these\na distinct eigenvectors, we can construct an orthonormal\n(a)\neigenbasis of \u03a0\u0302 (and thus of \u00db1 ), with elements {|y\u03bb0 i}\ngiven by Eq (6).\nIn view of Eqs. (13), and given that the sets \u03a9j are\n(\u03bb )\n(\u03bb )\n(a)\n/\ndisjoint, we have \u00db1 |y\u03bb0 i = \u03b2a,00 ei\u03c61 |v1 0 i + O(|ki | k \u2208\n\n\f5\n(a)\n\n\u03a90 \u222a \u03a91 ). Recalling that the state |y\u03bb0 i is also an eigenvector of \u00db1 (with eigenvalue 1), we find that e\n\n(\u03bb )\n\u03b2a,10\n\nP\n\ni\u03c61\n\n(\u03bb )\n\u03b2a,00\n\n=\n\n\u2200 a, and the orthogonality condition (7) yields\n\n(\u03bb0 ) 2\na |\u03b2a,0(1) |\n\n= 0. This, however, is not possible because\n(a)\n\nby construction, at least one of the vectors {|y\u03bb0 i} will\n(\u03bb0 )\n|\n|\u03b2a,0(1)\n\n(\u03bb0 ) (a)\n|y\u03bb0 i|\n|hv0(1)\n\n= 0.\n6= 0 and thus not all\nsatisfy\nWe have proved by contradiction, therefore, that PST\nfrom node l0 to node l1 , with the two nodes being parts\nof different cycles of \u03a0\u0302, is impossible.\nIn closing this section, we would like to point out an\nadditional constraint on the structure of the networks\nunder consideration, imposed by the assumption of the\nfinal unitary being a permutation. Using Eqs. (3), (4)\nand (6), one can express the Hamiltonian (5) in the computational basis, where it is apparent that all the physical\nnodes of the network that belong to the same cycle of the\npermutation must have the same energy.\nIV. HAMILTONIANS FOR PST BETWEEN\nMORE THAN TWO LOGICAL NODES\n\nIn this section, by employing the theorems of the previous section, we demonstrate how one can construct\nHamiltonians that achieve PST within a logical network\npertaining to more than two nodes.\nA.\n\nThe universal bus\n\nSuppose we are looking for Hamiltonians that transfer the excitation successively to each one of the d sites\nof a passive network, within a well-defined time \u03c4 . We\nrefer to this logical network as the universal bus, since\nit encompasses the entire physical network. The order\nin which the excitation is transferred along the network\nwill be as follows 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 d \u2212 1. This ordering\ndoes not affect the generality of our arguments because\nthe labeling of the sites is arbitrary. We do not allow,\nhowever, for the same site to get occupied twice within\nthe prescribed time of the transfer.\nAccording to theorem 2, the Hamiltonian of a universal\nbus can be associated only with a one-cycle permutation\n[26]. A case in point is the permutation\nX\n\u03a0\u0302ub = |d \u2212 1ih0| +\n|mihm + 1|,\n(14)\nm\u2208S\u2217\nd\n\nwith m \u2208 S\u2217d \u2261 Sd \\ {0, d \u2212 1}, and its eigenvalues and\neigenvectors given by Eqs. (4) and (3), respectively for\ndi = d and \u03a9i = Sd . The class of Hamiltonians that\ntransfer the excitation from node 0 to node d \u2212 1 at time\n\u03c4 , and the corresponding unitary transformation can be\nobtained from Eqs. (5) and (8) respectively, after dropping the index a and the inner summations. An important point to note is that any choice for the vector\n\nx = (x\u03bb1 , . . . , x\u03bbn ), with n \u2208 Sd , will lead to a Hamiltonian that satisfies exp(\u2212i\u0124\u03c4 ) = \u03a0\u0302ub , but we are interested in the choices that transfer the state to every node\nof the network.\nFor the transfer of the excitation from node 0 to node\nm \u2208 S\u2217d , the corresponding matrix element is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\u22121\n1X\n2\u03c0in(t\u2032 + m)\n\u2032\nhm|\u00db (t)|0i =\n,\n\u2212 2\u03c0ix\u03bbn t (15)\nexp\nd n=0\nd\n\nwhere t\u2032 = t/\u03c4 and m \u2208 S\u2217d . To achieve PST at time\nt, we ask for vectors x, such that hm|\u00db (t)|0i = ei\u03c6m , or\nequivalently\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\u03c0in(t\u2032 + m)\n\u2032\nexp\n\u2212 2\u03c0ix\u03bbn t = ei\u03c6m , \u2200 n \u2208 Sd . (16)\nd\n\nInstead of trying to find all of the possible solutions to\nthis problem, we will instead look for a simple, but infinite class of solutions. Let us impose the restriction\nthat the occupancy of the mth node must occur at time\n\u03c4m = m\u03c4 /(d \u2212 1). Then, it is straightforward to show\nthat one class of solutions to (16) is\nx\u03bbn = cm + n + (d \u2212 1)f (n),\n\n(17)\n\nwhere cm \u2208 R and f : Sd 7\u2192 Z. One can easily verify that\nEq. (17) leads to the state being perfectly transferred to\nthe mth node at time \u03c4m . Different choices for f (n) and\ncm will lead to different spectra for the Hamiltonian, and\nto different dynamics during the process of transferring\nthe state between any two nodes of the network. We have\nthus found an infinite class of universal-bus Hamiltonians, for passive quantum networks with resonant physical\nnodes. This is in contrast to other solutions for \"all-toall\" networks, which require to switch on and off couplings or energy shifts for the nodes, in order to achieve\nPST within a prescribed set of logical nodes [15].\nB.\n\nTransfer to a subset of nodes\n\nLet us now consider logical networks with bus (but\nnot universal) topology i.e., the set of logical nodes is\n{lj } = L \u2282 Sd . We will construct Hamiltonians, which\nare capable of transferring successively an excitation initially occupying one of the logical nodes, to each one\nof the other logical nodes in a perfect and deterministic manner. As before, one can look for solutions where\nthe occupation times for any two logical nodes lj and\nlj \u2032 , with j > j \u2032 , satisfy \u03c4j > \u03c4j \u2032 . We can impose here\nan additional constraint namely, PST should occur for\nthe nodes of the logical network only. This last requirement automatically excludes the universal bus, since it\nwill transfer the excitation successively to any node of\nthe physical network.\nConsider a network consisting of five physical nodes\n(i.e., d = 5), and three logical nodes L = {0, 2, 4}. According to theorem 2, if we are looking for PST Hamiltonians, which at time \u03c4 lead to a permutation \u03a0 that\n\n\f6\npermutes the nodes 0 and 4, then all three logical nodes\nhave to belong to the same cycle of \u03a0. Moreover, to restrict the flow of information within the logical network\nonly, we should avoid choosing permutations for which\nnonlogical nodes are in the same cycle as the logical ones\n[27].\nA permutation that satisfies the above requirements is\n\u03a0\u0302 = |4ih0| + |0ih2| + |2ih4| + |1ih3| + |3ih1|,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich can be decomposed into two cycles \u03a0\u03020 = |4ih0| +\n|0ih2| + |2ih4| and \u03a0\u03021 = |1ih3| + |3ih1|. The eigenvectors\nand eigenvalues of these cycles can be obtained from Eqs.\n(3) and (4) respectively, for \u03a90 = {0, 2, 4}, \u03a91 = {1, 3},\nd0 = 3 and d1 = 2. The spectrum of \u03a0\u0302 is degenerate,\nsince the two cycles have a common eigenvalue \u03bb0 , while\nan eigenbasis can be constructed along the lines of Sec.\nII. Taking into account the orthogonality condition one\nobtains\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n|y0 i = \u03b1|v0 i + \u03b2|v1 i,\n(2)\n|y0 i =\n|y\u03c0(1) i =\n(1)\n|yk2\u03c0/3 i\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(19a)\n\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03b2 |v0 i \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 |v1 i,\n(\u03c0)\n|v1 i,\n(k2\u03c0/3)\n= |v0\ni for k =\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n\n(19b)\n(19c)\n1, 2,\n\n(19d)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b21,0 = \u03b1, \u03b21,1 = \u03b2, \u03b22,0 = \u03b2 \u2217 , \u03b22,1 = \u2212\u03b1\u2217 , and\n|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Note that, to suppress notation, the\nvectors as well as the components of the integer vector\nx in the following, are labeled according to arg(\u03bbn ), and\nnot the actual eigenvalue \u03bbn .\nA class of PST Hamiltonians that transfer the excitation from node 0 to node 4 at time \u03c4 is given by Eq. (5),\nand the corresponding evolution operator is of the form\n(8). We shall now investigate the choices of the spectrum\n{\u03b5\u03bbn }, and thus of the integer vector x, which enable us\nto achieve also PST from node 0 to node 2, at an earlier\ntime t < \u03c4 . To this end, we focus on the matrix element\nh2|\u00db (t)|0i for which, using Eq. (19), we find\n|\u03b1|2\n(1)\nexp(\u22122\u03c0ix0 t\u2032 )\n3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n2\u03c0i(t\u2032 + 1)\n(1)\n\u2212 2\u03c0ix2\u03c0/3 t\u2032\n+ exp\n3\n3\n2\n|\u03b2|\n(2)\nexp(\u22122\u03c0ix0 t\u2032 )\n+\n3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n4\u03c0i(t\u2032 + 1)\n(1)\n\u2032\n+ exp\n\u2212 2\u03c0ix4\u03c0/3 t ,(20)\n3\n3\n\nh2|\u00db (t)|0i =\n\nwhere t\u2032 = t/\u03c4 . We also have for the matrix elements\npertaining to non-logical nodes\n\u03b2\u03b1\u2217\n(1)\nh1|\u00db (t)|0i = h3|\u00db (t\u2032 )|0i = \u221a exp(\u2212i2\u03c0x0 t\u2032 )\n6\n\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2\n(2)\n\u2212 \u221a exp(\u2212i2\u03c0x0 t\u2032 ).\n(21)\n6\n\n(1)\n\nEquation (20) shows that we are free in choosing x\u03c0 ,\nas this will not affect the probability of transferring the\nexcitation to node 2.\nTo proceed further we can specify a time at which the\nstate will be transferred from node 0 to node 2, let us\nsay \u03c42 = \u03c4 /2 or equivalently t\u2032 = 1/2. Hence, we ask\nfor h2|\u00db (\u03c42 )|0i = ei\u03c62 . This requirement will constrain\n(a)\nthe allowed values of the integers {x\u03bbn }, that appear\nin Eq. (20). We can distinguish between two cases.\n(1)\n(i) For |\u03b1| = 0 or 1, either |\u03b1|2 exp(\u22122\u03c0ix0 t\u2032 )/3 or\n(2)\n|\u03b2|2 exp(\u22122\u03c0ix0 t\u2032 )/3 will be zero and thus, without loss\n(1)\n(2)\nof generality, we can set x0 = x0 . Working similarly\nto Sec. IV A, we find that the transfer is facilitated by\nchoosing\n(1)\n\nx\u03bd2\u03c0/3 = c + \u03bd + 2f (\u03bd), for \u03bd \u2208 {0, 1, 2} \u2261 Z3 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere c is a constant and f : Z3 7\u2192 Z. (ii) For 0 <\n|\u03b1| < 1, in addition to |h2|\u00db (\u03c42 )|0i| = 1 we require that\n(1)\n(2)\n|h1(3)|\u00db (\u03c42 )|0i| = 0, which implies that x0 = x0 + q\nfor even integers q \u2208 N. As in case (i), it can be readily\nchecked that a suitable choice for the other components of\nx is provided by Eq. (22). It should be emphasized also\nthat according to observation 1, the occupation probabilities of the non-logical nodes (1 and 3), cannot exceed\n2/3 for any t < \u03c4 , and thus PST occurs within the logical\nnetwork only. In the appendix B, we discuss a possible\nphysical ralization of this PST Hamiltnian in the context\nof spin chains. Finally, it is straightforward to generalize\nthe previous derivation to a case where the PST from\nnode 0 to node 2 has to occur at a time \u03c4m = \u03c4 /m, for\nm > 2.\nFor networks with d > 5 nodes, it is rather difficult\nto obtain analytic results, but one can resort to numerical investigations. In Fig. 1 we present results pertaining to a network consisting of 11 physical nodes, and\ntwo different choices of logical nodes. For Fig. 1(a),\nthe set of logical nodes is La = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, whereas\nfor Fig. 1(b), Lb = {0, 3, 6, 10}. To construct Hamiltonians that allow for PST within these sets of logical\nnodes, one has to work as before. Following theorem 2\nand observation 1, in both cases we have chosen a permutation which has a cycle that contains only the logical nodes e.g., \u03a0a = |10ih0| + |8ih10| + |6ih8| + |4ih6| +\n|2ih4| + |0ih2| + |9ih1| + |7ih9| + |5ih7| + |3ih5| + |1ih3|,\nand \u03a0b = |10ih0| + |6ih10| + |3ih6| + |0ih3| + |9ih1| +\n|8ih9| + |7ih8| + |5ih7| + |4ih5| + |2ih4| + |1ih2|. Each one\nof these permutations consists of two cycles and let d0(1)\ndenote the cardinality of the cycle containing the node\n0(1), respectively. The class of Hamiltonians that transfer the excitation from node 0 to node 10 at time t = \u03c4 is\ngiven by Eq. (5), and one can choose the integer vector\nx, and thus the spectrum {\u03b5\u03bbn }, so that the excitation\nis transferred successively to the other nodes of the logi(m)\ncal network La(b) at well defined times \u03c4a(b) < \u03c4 , for m \u2208\nLa(b) \\ {0, 10}. When asking for these times to be equally\n(m)\nspaced i.e., \u03c4a(b) = m\u03c4 /(|La(b) | \u2212 1), one can choose: (a)\n\n\f7\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.8\n1\n\n0.6\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.4\n5\n\n6\n\nNode\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0.2\n9 10 0\n\nt/\u03c4\n\nProbability\n\nProbability\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.8\n1\n\n0.6\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.4\n5\n\n6\n\nNode\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0.2\n9 10 0\n\nt/\u03c4\n\nFIG. 1: PST in a network of logical bus topology, with logical nodes: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} (a), and {0, 3, 6, 10} (b).

The excitation evolves under the influence of a\nsingle Hamiltonian which acts on the entire network, and\nis transferred successively to each one of the logical nodes\nin a perfect and deterministic manner. We have provided\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the engineering of\nsuch networks, by concatenating a number of point-topoint PST links of any type. Our theory is not subject\nto any a priori restrictions on the physical topology of\nthe network, or its initial state, and provides new ways\nfor quantum network engineering beyond point-to-point\nlogical topology.\nThe network engineering has been demonstrated in the\ncontext of a set of point-to-point PST links, where the\ntransformation associated with one of them is a permutation. Such an assumption automatically imposes certain\nrestrictions on the physical topology of the network, but\nis not very restrictive since many known PST Hamiltonians can be obtained in this framework. Although our\nformalism allows for the construction of Hamiltonians of\nany kind, which can be rather tedious, we restricted our\nnetwork engineering to Hamiltonians that involve complex couplings. In spin networks, the adjustment of geometric phases is possible by looping around magnetic\nfields along the relevant sections [3, 28], while for optical\nnetworks one may use phase shifters.\nA number of interesting questions, such as the design\nof passive quantum networks with other logical topolo-\n\ngies, the problem of time-limited PST, and the transfer\nof entangled states (encoded on two or more nodes) in\nnetworks of bus topology, deserve further investigation.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTB and IJ acknowledge support from MSM 684077039\nand LC06002 of the Czech Republic.

(8) which\nprovides the operator \u00db (t) = exp(\u2212i\u0124t) with \u00db (\u03c4 ) =\n\u03a0\u0302. Using the triangle inequality we have for the matrix\nelement of interest\nX\n(a)\n(a)\n|hl1 |\u00db (t)|l0 i| \u2264\n(A1)\nhl1 |y\u03bbn ihy\u03bbn |l0 i .\n\u03bbn ,a\n\nGiven that l0(1) \u2208 \u03a0\u03020(1) , it is clear that the matrix el(a)\nements |hl0(1) |y\u03bbn i| vanish unless \u03bbn is an eigenvalue of\n\u03a0\u03020(1) , respectively. Let \u03c3 denote the set of eigenvalues\nthat \u03a0\u03020 and \u03a0\u03021 have in common. Then, using Eqs. (3)\nand (6), we have\nX X (\u03bb ) (\u03bb )\n1\n|hl1 |\u00db (t)|l0 i| \u2264 \u221a\n|\u03b2a,0n ||\u03b2a,1n |\nd1 d2 \u03bb \u2208\u03c3 a\nn\ns\nX X (\u03bb ) X (\u03bb )\n1\n\u2264 \u221a\n|\u03b2a,0n |2\n|\u03b2a,1n |2 ,\nd1 d2 \u03bb \u2208\u03c3\na\na\nn\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere the second part is due to Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Finally, using Eq. (7) we obtain |hl1 |\u00db (t)|l0 i| \u2264\n\n\f8\n\u0001 \u221a\n1 / d0 d1 , where the summation equals the total number of eigenvalues that \u03a0\u03020 and \u03a0\u03021 have in common, and cannot exceed the total number of eigenvalues of either of the two cycles.\nHence, we have that\n\u221a\n|hl1 |\u00db (t)|l0 i| \u2264 min{d0 , d1 }/ d0 d1 , which when squared\nleads to inequality (11).\nP\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u03c3\n\nAPPENDIX B: PST IN A SPIN CHAIN WITH\nTHREE LOGICAL NODES\n\nThe formalism we have adopted throughout this work\nis rather general, and can be easily adjusted to a particular physical implementaiton of the network. For instance,\nto make the example of Sec. IV B more concrete, let us\nconsider the situation where the network is a spin chain,\nwith d = 5 and L = {0, 2, 4}.\nIn this case each node possesses two degrees of freedom, corresponding to the individual spins being either\nup or down along a particular direction, i.e. |\u00b1i, with\n|\u2212i\u22975 denoting the ground state of the chain. The source\nnode (0) is considered to be initially de-correlated from\nthe rest of the spins [24], and let the state of the entire\nchain be |\u03a8(0)i = |\u03c8i0 |\u2212i\u22974 , where |\u03c8i = b1 |+i + b2 |\u2212i\n(see also related discussion towards the end of Sec. II).\nThe state of the source site has to be transferred successively to the sites 2 and 4, at the prescribed times\n\u03c42 = \u03c4 /2 and \u03c44 = \u03c4 , respectively. This means that the\nstate of the entire chain has to transform according to\n|\u03a8(0)i \u2192 |\u03a8(\u03c42 )i \u2192 |\u03a8(\u03c44 )i, where |\u03a8(\u03c4j )i = |\u03c8ij |\u2212i\u22974 .\nThe initial state, however, is basically a superposition of\nthe ground state and the first-excited state of the chain,\ni.e., |\u03a8(0)i = b1 |+i0 |\u2212i\u22974 + b2 |\u2212i\u22975 . Thus, given that\nthe ground state does not evolve in time, for the transfer of |\u03a8i in time, it is sufficient to consider PST in the\none-excitation subspace i.e., |0i \u2192 |2i \u2192 |4i, where\n|mi = |\u2212i\u2297m |+im |\u2212i4\u2212m .\n\n(B1)\n\nThe solution of this problem has been dicussed in Sec.\nIV B, in the context of a PST Hamiltonian that satisfies Eq. (1) with \u03a0\u0302 given by Eq. (18). A class of PST\nHamiltonians that transfer the excitation from spin 0 to\n(a)\nspin 4 at time \u03c4 is given by Eq. (5), with |y\u03bbn i given by\nEq. (19). This class of Hamiltonians can be expressed\nin terms of the the Pauli spin operators X\u0302j and \u0176j acting on the jth spin, with X\u0302j = |\u2212ij h+| + |+ij h\u2212| and\n\u0176j = i(|\u2212ij h+| \u2212 |+ij h\u2212|), using the convention (B1).\nIt is convenient to split the analysis into two different\ncases i.e., to couplings between spins that belong to the\nsame cycle, and couplings between spins that belong to\ndifferent cycles.\nA simple calculation shows that the spins 1 and 3 (nonlogical nodes), which belong to the same cycle \u03a0\u03021 , are\n\n[1] See, for example, Steinke S 2003 Network Tutorial (San\nFrancisco: CMP Books) p 99; P Ciccarelli and P\n\ncoupled by a term in the Hamiltonian that has the following form\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n1 \u0010 2 (1)\n(2)\n|\u03b2| \u03b50 + |\u03b1|2 \u03b50 + \u03b51\u03c0 X\u03021 X\u03023 + \u01761 \u01763 .

(B3), with m \u2208 \u03a90 and\nn \u2208 \u03a91 . The corresponding coupling constants are given\nby\ni\ni\nI(\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 ) h (1)\nR(\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 ) h (1)\n(2)\n(2)\n\u2032\n\u221a\n= \u221a\n\u03b50 \u2212 \u03b50 , Jmn\n\u03b50 \u2212 \u03b50 ,\n6\u03c4\n6\u03c4\n(B6)\nwhere R(\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 ) and I(\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 ) denote the real and imaginary\n\u2032\n\u2032\nparts of \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 respectively, while Jmn\n= \u2212Jnm\nfor m <\nn. The values of the coupling constants, given by Eqs.\n(B2), (B4) and (B6) are real and depend on the choice of\n(a)\nthe integers xj , as well as on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nThe coupling constants can thus be adjusted while still\nobtaining Hamiltonians that perform the desired PST.\n(2)\n(1)\nFor instance, taking x0 = x0 will result in vanishing\ncouplings between spins that belong to different cycles.\nFinally, setting for convenience the ground state energy\nequal to zero, one readily obtains for the diagonal terms\nof the Hamiltonian\n\nJmn =\n\nh0|\u0124|0i = h2|\u0124|2i = h4|\u0124|4i\ni\n1 h (1) 2\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n=\n\u03b50 |\u03b1| + \u03b50 |\u03b2|2 + \u03b52\u03c0/3 + \u03b54\u03c0/3\n3\u03c4\ni\n1 h (1) 2\n(2)\n.\n\u03b50 |\u03b2| + \u03b50 |\u03b1|2 + \u03b5(1)\nh1|\u0124|1i = h3|\u0124|3i =\n\u03c0\n2\u03c4\n(B7)\nIt can be seen that the nodes belonging to the same cycle\nhave the same energy, when they are in the state |+i.\nThe energies of each node can be adjusted by changing\n(a)\nthe values of the integers xj .\n\nFaulkner 2004 Networking Foundations:Technology Fun-\n\n\f9\ndamentals for IT Success (San Francisco: Sybex) pp 87\n[2] In a classical setting, this is achieved by means of the socalled internet-protocol (IP) addresses. As the message\narrives at each node, the corresponding device checks\nthe destination address contained in the message to see\nif it matches its own address. If the two addresses match\nthe device processes the message, otherwise it does nothing. Clearly, no addressing is required in a point-to-point\ntopology since any data transmitted from one port is intended for the other port.\n[3] For recent reviews, see S. Bose, Contemp.
