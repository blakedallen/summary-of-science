Dodd, and Roderich Gross\nDepartment of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering\nThe University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, S1 3JD Sheffield, UK\n\nKeywords: optimization, heuristic search algorithms, gravitational search\nalgorithm, law of gravity\nIn [1], Rashedi, Nezamabadi-pour and Saryazdi propose an interesting\noptimization algorithm called 'GSA: A Gravitational Search Algorithm'. The\npaper has received numerous citations since its publication in 2009.\nGSA simulates a set of agents in an N\u2013dimensional search space, which\nbehave as point masses. The position of agent i, denoted by ~xi , represents a\ncandidate solution for the optimization problem at hand. The mass of agent\ni, denoted by mi , is correlated with the quality of the candidate solution\nit represents: the higher the quality, the higher the mass. The agents are\nsaid to \"interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the\nlaws of motion\" [1]. If the law of gravity were to be strictly followed, the\nmagnitude of the force exerted on agent i by agent j (and vice versa) should\nbe \"proportional to the mass of each and [vary] inversely as the square of the\ndistance between them\" [2]. Formally,\n||f~ij || = G\n\nmi mj\n,\n2\nRij\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G is a proportionality constant analogous to the universal gravitational\nconstant and Rij = ||~xj \u2212 ~xi || is the Euclidean distance between agents i and\nj.\nThe authors claim to have implemented a law of gravity where the magnitude of the force between two agents is inversely proportional to the distance\nR between them. They use \"R instead of R2 , because according to [their]\nexperiment results, R provides better results than R2 in all experimental\ncases\" [1].\nPreprint submitted to Information Sciences\n\nSeptember 1, 2018\n\n\fIn GSA, according to Equation 7 in [1], the force exerted on agent i by\nagent j along dimension d \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N} of the search space is calculated\nas follows:\n\u0001\nmi mj\nfijd = G\nxdj \u2212 xdi ,\n(2)\nRij + \u01eb\nwhere \u01eb is a small positive constant used to avoid division by zero.\nHowever, in order to obtain the force vector f~ij , its magnitude, ||f~ij ||,\nshould be multiplied by the unit vector\u0001pointing from agent i to agent j.\nEquation 2 is not correct in that xdj \u2212 xdi is not normalized. The denomina3\ntor of Equation 2 should read Rij\nin order to implement an inverse-square law,\n2\nor Rij in order to implement an inverse-linear law (as the authors intended).\nUsing Rij effectively makes the magnitude of the force f~ij independent of the\ndistance between agents i and j. Formally, assuming \u01eb = 0,\n||f~ij || = Gmi mj .\n\n(3)\n\nWe do not in any way intend to undermine GSA's capabilities as an optimization algorithm; rather, our observation is that it is not strictly motivated\nby how gravity works (compare Equations 1 and 3). Mass and distance are\nboth integral parts of the law of gravity; in contrast, the force model used in\nGSA is independent of the distance between the agents and is based solely\non their masses (qualities of candidate solutions).\nReferences\n[1] E.
