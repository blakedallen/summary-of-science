The synthetic field technique has allowed access to the quantum\nHall regime [5] and has realized nontrivial textures in\nspinor BECs [6\u20139].\nIt is well known in fermion systems such as topological\ninsulators and superconductors that spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) plays a crucial role. This is particularly true for\nfermionic superfluid 3 He because SOC due originally to\nthe 3 He nuclear dipole-dipole interaction is decisive in determining the order parameter (OP) textures, although\nits force is so tiny that it modifies the Cooper pair structure itself, as first pointed out by Leggett [10]. Since in\nbosonic superfluids, namely the spinor BEC [11, 12], no\ncorresponding \"natural\" SOC exists, one may implement\nit by using a \"synthetic\" gauge potential to better understand and control the OP space in spinor BEC systems.\nIn fact, we see that by introducing SOC, they exhibit a\nplethora of types of the OP textures in a controlled way,\nsuch as fractional vortices, two-dimensional periodic textures, and skyrmions.\nThe pseudospin states are the eigenenergy states of\nthe laser-atom interaction, sufficiently isolated from the\nother states. The adiabatic motion of these states produces a vector potential in real space [2\u20134, 13]. Several\nschemes to generate gauge fields are suggested. One of\nthem is the \u039b scheme [3, 4], which is useful to realize a\nsymmetric spin-orbit coupling term, such as the Rashbatype SOC. The different scheme is implemented by the\nNIST group [2], where the SOC consists of the equal contribution of the Rashba and Dresselhaus types.\nThe gauge transformation cannot remove the spatially\nuniform non-Abelian vector potential. Thus, the BECs\nhave a spatially modulated OP and textures due to finite\nmomentum [6\u20138]. Nontrivial textures due to the Rashbatype SOC in pseudospin F = 1/2 and F = 1 BECs have\nbeen studied recently [7]. The two possible textures are\nthe one-dimensional plane and standing waves; in the\nformer, the phase of the OP varies and in the latter,\n\nthe amplitude oscillates along a favorable direction. In\nF = 1 BECs, the stable region of the plane and standing\nwaves is equivalent to that of the ferromagnetic and polar\nphases, respectively [11]. However, we emphasize here\nthat an open question remains of how textural structures\ncan emerge in F = 2 spinor BECs, where the cyclic phase\ndistinct from the manifold of the ferromagnetic and polar\nphase can be the magnetic ground state.\nThe aim in this Rapid Communication is to clarify the\nrole of the SOC in bosonic superfluids. We focus on F = 2\nspinor BECs, since they have magnetic ground states\nthat include the cyclic phase. On the basis of the analysis\nof the SOC energy, we reveal that the plane (standing)\nwave realized in ferromagnetic (polar) phase can be interpreted as the rotation of the OP in pseudospin space,\nwhich simultaneously propagates along one direction in\nreal space. In addition, skyrmions of the uniaxial polar\nOP emerge in the small size of the system. This analysis enables us to understand the emergence of nontrivial\ntextural structures in the cyclic phase. We demonstrate\nthat the hexagonal lattice and 31 -vortex lattice states are\nenergetically competitive. We also calculate the phase\ndiagram where the spin-spin interaction favors the cyclic\nphase.\nWe consider a zero temperature F = 2 spinor BEC\nwith a SOC.

However,\nin an F = 2 spinor BEC system, the experimental setup\n\n\f2\nfor realizing the precise Rashba-type SOC form with \u03b2 =\n\u221a\n6/2 has not been found thus far.\nTo reveal the role of the SOC term in Eq.

(3) are found to\nbe energetically dominant, compared to the offdiagonal\nelements. This is because the oscillation terms with \u03c9 n\n(n 6= 0) hardly contribute to energetics when they are integrated over r. The dominant elements are proportional\nto k * nR . (i) The SOC favors the situation where the rotation axis n\u0302R corresponds to the modulation vector k\u0302.\nWe call this spatial modulation the helical modulation.\nIn addition, we define the angular resolved SOC energy\n~ I ) \u2261 hSO (k, n\u0302R = k\u0302, \u03a8\n~ I ), which denotes\ndensity hAR (k, \u03a8\n~ I with a given modulation\nthe SOC energy density for \u03a8\nvector k. (ii) The helical modulation of the OP is independent of the details of \u221a\nSOC term, such as the precise\nRashba-type SOC (\u03b2 = 6/2, that is, C = 0) and the\nRashba-like SOC (\u03b2 = 1) implemented by the planar\nhexapod setup [4].\nHere, we assume that the atoms in pseudospin states\ninteract through the most symmetric interaction:\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\nHint =\n(4)\nd2 r c0 n2 + c1 S * S + c2 |A00 |2 ,\n2\n\n~ \u2020 \u03a8,\n~ S =\u03a8\n~ \u2020 \u03c3 \u03a8,\n~ and A00 = (2\u03c82 \u03c8\u22122 \u22122\u03c81 \u03c8\u22121 +\nwhere n\u221a= \u03a8\n\u03c80 \u03c80 )/ 5 are the particle density, the spin density, and\nthe singlet pair amplitude, respectively. The purpose of\nusing this assumption is to concentrate on the symmetry breaking due to the SOC term. In addition, it is\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) OP profiles in pseudospin space and\nenergetically favored modulation vectors of ground states: (a)\nFM, (b) BP, and (c) UP. The color on the surface corresponds\nto the phase of OP. The UP-skyrmion texture is shown in (d).\n\nknown that the minimization of Hint leads to four magnetic ground states: Ferromagnetic (FM), biaxial polar\n(BP), uniaxial polar (UP), and cyclic (CY) phase [12].\nWe numerically minimize the full Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional H0 +Hint without any restriction by using\nthe imaginary time evolution scheme in the presence of\nthe cylindrical symmetric trap. The numerical results\npresented in this Rapid Communication are obtained by\nsetting the parameter \u03b2 =1 and all of the results are not\nchanged qualitatively by the parameter \u03b2. The numerical calculation reveals that for the FM parameter region,\nas shown in Fig. 1(a), the resulting OP can be simplified\nto the one-dimensional helical modulation of the uniform\n~\n~ FM\nFM OP along the \u0177 axis, that is, \u03a8(r)\n= R\u0302(ky, \u0177)\u03a8\n\u22121\nT\n~\nwith \u03a8FM = R\u0302 (\u03c0/3, \u00ea111 )[1, 0, 0, 0, 0] . The wave number k depends on \u03ba. In the same way, the favorable\n~ FM in \u03a8\n~ BP =\nOP for the BP is given by replacing \u03a8\n\u22121\nT\nR\u0302 (\u03c0/3, \u00ea111 )[1, 0, 0, 0, 1] , which is shown in Fig. 1(b).\nUsing these simplified OPs, the SOC \u221a\nenergy density\n\u221a re~ FM(BP) )| = ~2 \u03bak( 6\u03b2 + 1)/4 2, induces to |hAR (k \u0177, \u03a8\ndependent of the FM and BP. These one dimensional helical modulations of the FM and BP are consistent with\nthose realized in F = 1/2 and F = 1 systems [7].\nIn contrast, the favorable OP in the UP state reduces\n~\n~ UP with \u03a8\n~ UP = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]T,\nto \u03a8(r)\n= R\u0302(k * r, k\u0302)\u03a8\nwhere the modulation vector k can be arbitrary in the\nx-y plane as shown in Fig. 1(c). Because k is not unique,\nthe most favorable modulation turns out to be k k r,\nresulting in the skyrmion texture in Fig. 1(d). The\nSOC energy density of the\n\u221a is found to be\n\u221a UP skyrmion\n~ UP )| = 3~2 \u03bak( 6\u03b2 + 1)/16 2, which is less\n|hAR (kr, \u03a8\nthan that of the FM and BP.\nWe note that the UP and BP are degenerate in the\nabsence of SOC \u03ba = 0. In the presence of the Rashba-like\nSOC, the energetics of the UP skyrmion texture and BP\nstanding wave is determined by the ratio of two length\n\n\f3\nscales 1/\u03ba and the Thomas-Fermi radius RTF , which\ncharacterize the modulation in real space and the size\nof the condensate, respectively. The stable region of the\nUP skyrmion is 1/\u03ba & RTF , while the BP standing wave\nbecomes stable for 1/\u03ba . RTF .\nNext, we move to the textures in the CY parameter\nregion with c1 \u2265 0 and c2 \u2265 0. The OP of the CY is\ncharacterized by a nodal structure as shown in inner bottom of Fig. 2, which has eight point nodes at \u00b1x\u0302\u00b1 \u0177\u00b1 \u1e91,\n\u00b1x\u0302\u2213\u0177\u00b1\u1e91, \u00b1x\u0302\u00b1\u0177\u2213\u1e91, and\u00b1x\u0302\u2213\u0177\u2213\u1e91 and six antinodes. Their\npoint nodes are connected with saddle lines. The inherent difference from those shown in Fig. 1 arises from the\nthree-dimensional form of the nodal points. This three\ndimensionality gives rise to the textures with the twodimensional modulation vectors as mentioned below.\nBefore going to the numerical results, we discuss the\nrole of the SOC term in Eq. (1) for the cyclic phase.\n~I =\nIt is convenient\nto introduce two OP vectors \u03a8\n\u221a\n~\n~\n~\nR\u0302(arccos[1/ 3], x\u0302 + \u0177)\u03a8CY \u2261 \u03a8P and\u221a\u03a8I = R\u0302(\u03c0/2, x\u0302 +\n~ CY \u2261 \u03a8\n~ S .

Here, it is found that the\n~I = \u03a8\n~ P,\nmost stable situation in the cyclic region is \u03a8\nwhere one of the point nodes points to the \u1e91 direction.\nHowever, note that the SOC in Eq. (1) also gives rise\nto the helical modulation of the OP, which rotates the\ndirection of the point node from the \u1e91 axis.\nLet us argue the stable textures in real space for\nc1 /c0 \u2265 0 and c2 /c0 \u2265 0. Based on the numerical calculation of the full GP equation including the SOC term, we\nfind three kinds of textures: The uniform cyclic texture,\nthe CY-UP hexagonal lattice texture shown in Fig. 3,\nand the 13 -vortex lattice texture shown in Fig. 4.\nThe emergence of the CY-UP lattice texture is\nstraightforwardly comprehensible, on the basis of the argument of the SOC energy in the cyclic OP. As shown in\nFigs. 3(a) and 3(b), this texture consists of the hexagonal\nunit cell in which the polar state is localized. Here, we\nlook carefully into the texture inside the hexagonal unit\ncell. As seen in Fig. 3(c), the unit cell consists of the uniaxial polar OP at U0 enclosed by cyclic OPs at P1 to P6 ,\nwhich are obtained from the numerical calculation of the\nGP equation. At all the points P1 -P6 , one of the point\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The main panel describes the SOC\nR\n~ I ).

In addition, at P1 the\nother three point nodes are located at (\u03b8,\u221a\u03c6) = (\u03b80 , \u2212\u03c0/3),\n(\u03b80 , \u03c0/3), and (\u03b80 , \u03c0) with \u03b80 = arccos(2 2/3).

The point node (\u03b80 , \u03c0/3)\nand (\u03b80 , \u03c0) at P1 is oriented to the \u1e91 direction at P6\nand P4 . In the same way, the OP at P2 can propagate with the helical modulation along the circumference\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Profiles of the 13 -vortex lattice texture:\n(a) pseudospin density S(r), (b) singlet amplitude A00 (r),\nand (c) the order parameter.

We fix the parameter c1 /c0 = 0.2. The stable phase\nfor \u03baRTF . 1 continuously changes from the UP skyrmion to\nuniform CY texture. In the \u03baRTF & 1 region, three textures\nappear: The BP standing wave for the small c2 /c0 , the CYUP lattice (hexagon), and 31 -vortex lattice (square).\n\nP2 \u2192 P3 \u2192 * * * \u2192 P1 . Note that the cyclic phase at P1 can\nhave six modulation vectors which have isotropic energy\ngain in the SOC term, as shown in Fig. 2. The central\nregion of the unit cell in Fig. 3(c) is occupied by the UP\nOP to avoid frustration of the cyclic OP at U0 . Hence,\nin this sense this network of the helical modulation can\nbe regarded as the close-packed hexagonal lattice of the\ncyclic OP whose point node points to the \u1e91 axis.\nThe other possible texture in the cyclic region is displayed in Fig. 4, which can be the ferromagnetic core at\nF0 enclosed by cyclic OPs. At A1 in Fig. 4(c), the antinode points to the \u1e91 axis, which cannot be the ground state\nof the SOC energy in Eq. (1). The OP at A1 has fourfold\n\nsymmetry in the x-y plane. The OP at A1 can be continuously transformed to that at A2 by the helical modulation along \u2212x\u0302\u2212 \u0177 with the rotation angle \u03c0/2. After the\nhelical modulation along the path A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 * * *A1 in the\nsame way, the OP results in the shape where the antinode\npoints to the \u1e91 axis. However, the resulting OP differs\nfrom the original one and has the phase shift +2\u03c0/3. In\norder to recover the single-value nature at A1 , the phase\nshift \u22122\u03c0/3 is compensated by the U (1) phase of the\nOP. Hence, this texture with fourfold symmetry can be\nregarded as the square lattice of the 13 vortices, in the\nsense that the U (1) phase of the cyclic OP continuously\nchanges by 2\u03c0/3 along the path A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 * * * \u2192 A1 .\nHere, the central region at F0 is occupied by the ferromagnetic core because of frustration of the cyclic OP. It\nis expected that the 31 vortex also appears in the cyclic\nphase of F = 2 spinor BEC under rotation [14], which\nbehaves as the non-Abelian vortices.\nIn Fig. 5, we summarize the phase diagram spanned\nby \u03baRTF and c2 /c0 . For \u03baRTF . 1, the stable texture\ncontinuously changes from the UP skyrmion to the uniform CY. For \u03baRTF & 1, the standing wave of the BP\nappears in the small c2 /c0 region. As c2 /c0 increases,\nthe hexagonal lattice of UP core and the 31 -vortex lattice\nbecome energetically competitive. The former texture is\nthe close-packed lattice of the CY OP with the point node\npointing to the \u1e91 axis. On the other hand, the FM core\nin the 13 -vortex lattice relatively favors the Hint , which\nbecomes stable in the large c2 /c0 region.\nIn summary, we have studied the stable textures of\nF = 2 spinor BEC with a spin-orbit interaction. Based\non the detailed analysis of the spin-orbit interaction, we\nfind that the ferromagnetic and biaxial polar OPs have a\nunique direction for the helical modulation, while that of\nthe uniaxial polar OP is not unique. The nonuniqueness\nleads to the emergence of the skyrmion textures, which\nbecome stable in the parameter region where the polar\nphase is stable. Moreover, we have computed the phase\ndiagram where the cyclic phase is the magnetic ground\nstate. The phase diagram is covered by two-dimensional\nlattices, such as the CY-UP lattice and 31 -vortex lattice. These lattice structures are understandable as the\ntwo-dimensional network of the helical modulation of the\ncyclic order parameters. We emphasize that those novel\ntextures are not seen in rotating F = 2 spinor BEC [15]\nand appear inherently due to SOC.\nWe should mention that the Hamiltonian for spinor\nBECs under synthetic gauge fields does not necessarily\nhave the pseudospin rotation symmetry [8], which can\nbe altered by the laser configuration and so on. Hence,\nthe general form of the Hint is open for future study.\nMoreover, the experimental observation of the textures\nremains a challenging problem different from those with\nhyperfine spins [16]\nNote added: Recently, we became aware of a preprint\nby Xu et al. [17], which has some overlap with our results.\n\n\f5\nThe authors thank M.
