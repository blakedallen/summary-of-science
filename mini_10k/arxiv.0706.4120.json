Here, following\nour recent development of optical lumped circuit elements, we show how a special class of\nnanowaveguides formed by a thin core with relatively large (positive or negative) permittivity\nsurrounded by a thin concentric shell with low permittivity may provide the required analogy to\n\"wires\" for optical nano-circuits.\n\nPACS numbers: 61.46.+w, 78.67.Bf , 78.20.-e, 07.50.Ek\n\n1\n\n\fThe fundamental concepts for extending the classic circuit theory to nanocircuits at optical\nfrequencies have been introduced and developed by our group in a recent letter [1]. In that work, we\nhave shown that it may be possible to realize lumped nanoinductors, nanocapacitors and\nnanoresistors by utilizing sub-wavelength nanoparticles with negative-real (plasmonic), positivereal (non-plasmonic) and imaginary (lossy) permittivity, respectively. In this framework, the role of\nconduction current density flowing in classic circuits is replaced by the displacement current\ndensity J d = \u2212i\u03c9\u03b5 E circulating in such a nanocircuit, with \u03c9 being the operating radian frequency\nunder an e\u2212 i\u03c9t time convention and \u03b5 the local permittivity. While for a single element it has been\nproven that the classic Kirchhoff laws in the circuit theory are satisfied in this nanocircuit paradigm\n[1] in terms of the current I defined as the flux integral of J d across the optical nanoelement and\nthe optical potential V between its two \"ends\", it is more challenging to envision a complex\nnanocircuit containing several closely packed nanocircuit elements connected with a special pattern.\nEven though we have shown that the basic parallel and series combinations of two optical\nnanoelements are indeed possible by suitably positioning two interconnected particles with respect\nto the orientation of the external field [2], and that the optical nanotransmission lines may be\ndesigned following simple circuit considerations on periodic arrangements of such elements [3]-[4],\nthe flexibility and possibility of connecting relatively distant optical lumped nanoelements or in\nconnecting insulated nanoparticles that are closely spaced on a nanocircuit board is not as\nstraightforward as in a classic circuit at lower frequencies [5]. This is because at lower frequencies,\nat which classic circuits rely on the conduction current ( J c = \u03c3 E , with \u03c3 being the local\nconductivity and E the local electric field) circulating across the elements, the background material\n(i.e., air) or the substrate of a circuit board are naturally very poorly conducting ( \u03c3 \u0011 0 ), and\ntherefore the elements are connected with each other only through the shorting metallic conducting\nwires attached to their terminals. At high frequencies (infrared and visible), however, the\ndisplacement current J d on which our nanocircuits rely may also flow in the surrounding\n2\n\n\fbackground materials, in some sense connecting all nanocircuit nanoelements together in an\nunwanted manner. In this nanocircuit paradigm, the role of material conductivity is indeed replaced\nby the local material permittivity \u03b5 . It follows, as discussed in [5], that the equivalent of a poorly\nconducting material in the framework of our optical nanocircuit theory is represented by a lowpermittivity ( \u03b5 -near-zero, ENZ) material, for which J d is close to zero despite the non-zero values\nof the local electric field. An ENZ material surrounding a lumped nanocircuit element would indeed\n\"insulate\" the element from the unwanted coupling with other neighboring elements, at least for\nwhat concerns the displacement current flow in it [5]. Analogously, the role of nanoconnectors may\nbe taken, in this nano-circuit analogy, by large permittivity materials ( \u03b5 -very-large, EVL, either\npositive or negative large permittivity), which may \"connect\" relatively distant optical\nnanoelements with a small potential drop, since for a given level of current J d the corresponding\nlongitudinal electric field, and the consequent voltage drop, are very low across the EVL connector.\nFollowing these heuristic concepts [1]-[5], the representation of a complex nanocircuit system is\ngetting closer to realization with feasible materials and technology at optical frequencies, i.e.,\nemploying naturally available plasmonic, non-plasmonic and/or polaritonic materials. In order to\nmake the picture more complete, however, it may be desirable to envision an optical \"wire\" that\nmay connect two parts of an optical nanocircuit or two or more nanocircuit elements, in the same\nmanner as classic metallic conducting wires at lower frequencies allow flow of conduction currents\nwith no current leakage and with negligible voltage drop. Such an optical \"wire\" should be able to\npass the displacement current flow with essentially no phase delay, without spreading and leaking it\naround its path, and with a sufficiently low optical potential drop across its terminals. In the\nfollowing, we investigate the possibility of providing these functionalities of an optical wire in the\noptical nanocircuit domain, exploiting the anomalous properties of EVL and ENZ materials.\nWe may heuristically envision the optical \"wire\" as a deeply sub-wavelength cylindrical waveguide\nthat is formed by a core with an EVL material surrounded by a thin ENZ shell, which bounds the\ndisplacement current flow in the EVL core and does not allow current leakage across it. Here, we\n3\n\n\fverify this prediction by studying this problem analytically and numerically, demonstrating how a\ndisplacement current flow with a low optical potential drop and low phase delay may be indeed\nobtained with such a structure. Since ENZ and EVL materials exist at infrared/optical frequencies\n[6] or they may be realized as layered metamaterials [7], realization of such optical nanowaveguides\nmay be envisioned in the optical domains.\nConsider the geometry of Fig. 1a: a cylindrical core of permittivity \u03b5 EVL surrounded by a shell with\npermittivity \u03b5 ENZ and surrounded by a background material with permittivity \u03b5 0 . The corresponding\nradii are, respectively, acore and ashell . All the material permeabilities are assumed to be the same as\nthat of free space \u03bc0 .\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 (Color online) The cross-section of an optical wire composed of an EVL core and an ENZ shell.

Arrows are drawn in scale and darker colors correspond to larger field amplitudes.\n\nAn azimuthally symmetric TM mode supported by such a waveguide has the following field\ndistributions in each region of space in Fig. 1 [8]:\nH = \u03c6\u02c6 A z1\nE = \u03c1\u02c6 A\n\n(\n\n)\n\nk 2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u03c1 ei\u03b2 z\n\n\u03b2\nz\n\u03c9\u03b5 1\n+i z\u02c6 A\n\n(\n\n)\nz (\n\nk 2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u03c1 ei \u03b2 z +\nk2 \u2212 \u03b2 2\n\n\u03c9\u03b5\n\n0\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n)\n\nk 2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u03c1 ei \u03b2 z\n\n4\n\n\fin the corresponding cylindrical reference system of Fig. 1, where \u03b2 denotes the propagation\nconstant of a guided mode, zn is the suitable n -th order Bessel function ( J n in the core region, a\nlinear combination of J n and Yn in the shell region and the Hankel function H n(1) in the background\nregion). Moreover, \u03b5 is the local permittivity in the different regions, k = \u03c9 \u03b5\u03bc0 is the local wave\nnumber and A a suitable coefficient (different in each region) to match the continuity of the\ntangential components of fields at the two interfaces. Fig. 1 shows an example of these field\ndistributions.\nThe general dispersion relation for the modes guided by this structure with arbitrary values for\nmaterial permittivities is well known [8]. Only for \u03b2 > k0 = \u03c9 \u03b5 0 \u03bc0 this dispersion equation admits\nreal solutions, which are the surface waves supported by a core-shell cylinder. In the limit of\n\n\u03b5 EVL \u0015 \u03b5 0 and \u03b5 ENZ \u0013 \u03b5 0 , together with the deep sub-wavelength cross-sectional dimensions\nashell \u0013 \u03bb0 = 2\u03c0 / k0 , the eigen-solutions assume the following interesting closed-form expression:\n\n\u03b22 =\n\n2\nk ENZ\n2 ln ashell / acore\n\n2\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\nJ 0 ( k EVL acore )\n\u239b k02 acore\n\u239e\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n2\nln\ni\n\u23a2\n\u239c\n\u239f \u2212 2\u03b3 \u23a5 ,\nk EVL acore J1 ( k EVL acore )\n\u239d 4 \u23a0\n\u23a3\n\u23a6\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler constant.\nThis closed-form expression is quite remarkable in its utility to find the propagation constants of\nguided modes supported by the waveguide of Fig. 1 in the limits of interest here, and it provides\nmany physical insights into its anomalous guidance properties. First of all, it is evident how the\nvalues of \u03b2 are proportional to the wave number in the shell region k ENZ , which tends to zero for\nlow-epsilon shell materials. This is physically expected, due to the low variation of phase in the\nENZ material, and is consistent with the findings in [9], regardless of the field excited inside the\nEVL core. Due to its low value, \u03b2 is required to be necessarily complex in order to take into\naccount the radiation leakage. In other words, since \u03b2 < k0 , the supported modes are leaky-modes,\n\n5\n\n\fand thus they necessarily radiate in the background region as manifested in the intrinsic complex\nnature of \u03b2 given in Eq. (2). (Note the analogies with the structure described in [10]).\nThe similarities with a standard shorting metallic conducting wire in a radio-frequency circuit\nbecome evident for the traveling modes described by (2): the phase variation along the wire is\nalmost zero (since \u03b2 \u221d k ENZ \u0011 0 ) and the electric and magnetic field distributions around it, as\n\ndepicted in Fig. 1, closely resemble those of a regular conducting wire at radio frequencies. It\nshould be noted that a regular metallic wire also radiates some small energy when a time-varying\ncurrent flows along its path, and its field distribution is distributed in the background material as\ndescribed in (1). Usually the radiation losses are negligibly small in classic RF circuits, due to the\nvery small electrical size of RF circuits and the subsequent quasi-static nature of the problem. Eq.\n(2) can fully take into account the radiation associated with a displacement current propagating with\n\n\u03b2 \u221d k ENZ \u0011 0 along this optical nanowire, again consistent with its lower frequency counterpart.\nIf we now consider the limit \u03b5 ENZ = 0 , we will note that the ENZ shell will act as a perfect magnetic\nconductor for this TM polarization, reducing the field to zero outside the core and imposing the\nstringent dispersion relation J1\n\n(\n\n)\n\n2\nk EVL\n\u2212 \u03b2 2 acore = 0 on the EVL core radius and/or material. This\n\ncondition, however, requires a very high positive value of \u03b5 EVL , due to the sub-wavelength\ndimensions of acore . An anomalous leaky-mode with \u03b2 = 0 may be envisioned in this limit, whose\nproperties however go beyond the interest of the present letter.\nHere we consider the scenario that assumes reasonable realistic values for ENZ materials, for which\n\n\u03b5 ENZ , while still small, is necessarily distinct from zero due to frequency dispersion and the inherent\npresence of losses. In this case Eq. (2) holds, which may provide more degrees of freedom for the\nspectrum of possible guided modes supported by this waveguide. Inspecting Eq. (2), we note that\nfor a propagating mode to be supported ( Re [ \u03b2 ] \u2260 0 ) we just require our geometry to satisfy the\nfollowing condition:\n\n6\n\n\f2\n\nJ 0 ( k EVL acore )\n\u239b k 2a2 \u239e\n+ ln \u239c 0 core \u239f + 2\u03b3 < 0 ,\nk EVL acore J1 ( k EVL acore )\n\u239d 4 \u23a0\n\n(3)\n\nwhich imposes some constraints on \u03b5 EVL for a fixed dimension of the inner core. (We note how, in\nthis limit, the outer radius of the shell ashell is not crucial in ensuring the guidance properties of Eq.\n(2), for which condition (3) is sufficient, even though it may play a role in the amplitude of \u03b2 ,\nappearing in the denominator of Eq. (2)). The imaginary part of \u03b2 , in this limit and under condition\n(3), is intrinsically small, since it is proportional to k ENZ . Its value, and the corresponding radiation\nfrom the wire, becomes negligible when the left-hand of Eq. (3) becomes sufficiently negative to\novercome the term ( i\u03c0 ) in (2), which happens near the condition J1 ( k EVL acore ) = 0 , i.e., when the\nENZ shell acts similar to a magnetic boundary.\nApplying (3), it is found that for small values of acore / \u03bb0 there is a relatively large range of possible\nvalues of \u03b5 EVL to have a guided mode in the structure, reasonably smaller than those required in\nprinciple if the ENZ shell were replaced by an ideal magnetic boundary. For instance, for an inner\ncore with acore = \u03bb0 / 20 , feasible at optical frequencies, a guided mode is supported in the region\n13.17 \u03b5 0 < \u03b5 EVL < 148.8\u03b5 0 . Figure 2, as an example, shows the calculated modal dispersion for a\nwaveguide with acore = \u03bb0 / 20 , ashell = acore / 0.8 , varying the material permittivities. Several\ninteresting features are evident in these plots: first of all, consistent with the previous discussion and\nfairly independent of the value of \u03b5 ENZ , the region of guidance is delimited by Eq. (3), which\nensures a low imaginary part of \u03b2 and a fast-wave propagation (low phase variation along the\nnano-wire) over a broad range of values for \u03b5 EVL . It is interesting to note, however, as evident from\nFig. 2, that this equation may be satisfied also by negative values of \u03b5 EVL , allowing to employ\nplasmonic materials in the core region, like noble metals and polar dielectrics or semiconductors,\nwidely available in nature at infrared and optical frequencies. The asymptotes in the figure coincide\nwith the roots of the dispersion relation J1 ( k EVL acore ) = 0 , that a small waveguide of the same\n7\n\n\fdimensions with magnetic boundaries would support. As previously noticed, near these asymptotes\nat the end of each branch of guided modes Im [ \u03b2 ] and the corresponding radiation losses tend to\nzero.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 (Color online) Dispersion of the guided wave number as a function of\n\n\u03b5 EVL\n\nvarying\n\n\u03b5 ENZ\n\nfor\n\nashell = acore / 0.8 .\n\nThe dependence of the wave number over the geometrical parameters of the waveguide is well\ndescribed by the approximate expression (2), as the comparison between the exact and approximate\nlines show in Fig. 2. The variation of the dispersion curves for a thinner or thicker shell, i.e.,\nvarying ashell , is again well described by Eq. (2), which implies a simple scaling of the\ncorresponding value of \u03b2 as the ln ashell / acore . This implies that a thicker ENZ core reduces both\n\n8\n\n\fthe phase variation along the wire and the radiation losses, as expectable from the previous physical\nconsiderations, due to the better insulation provided by the shell. The same result is obtained by\nreducing \u03b5 ENZ , as seen from the figure, and consistent with physical considerations. The nano-wire\noperation is indeed appealing, both for positive and negative values of \u03b5 EVL , ensuring a relatively\nbroad range of values of permittivities for which the required anomalous guidance may be obtained.\nInspecting the results of Fig. 2b concerning the imaginary part of the guided wave number \u03b2 , it is\nevident how the damping of such modes due to radiation losses is relatively low, ensuring that in\nthe sub-wavelength scale of an optical nano-circuit these nano-wires may transport the displacement\ncurrent from one end to the other, with small energy loss (in Fig. 2 we have not considered the\npresence of material losses, which may enter into play when the nano-wire has a very subwavelength cross-section or when the imaginary part of permittivity is relatively high). The results\nof Fig. 2b, however, are substantially unchanged when reasonable ohmic losses for optical materials\nare considered, as we show in the following examples that consider realistic material losses. As an\naside, the sign of Im [ \u03b2 ] in Fig. 2 also ensures that the guided modes in that specific example are\nall forward, independent of the sign of \u03b5 EVL . It may be proven, more in general, that the sign of \u03b5 ENZ\nis the one to affect directly the direction of propagation of this anomalous mode: backward\npropagation is obtained when \u03b5 ENZ has a negative real part (i.e., before the plasma frequency of the\nmaterial).\nThis may be seen more in detail in Fig. 3, where the full dispersion of the guided modes for a nanowire with ashell = acore / 0.8 has been plotted considering the necessary dispersion of the involved\nplasmonic materials. In this example, the ENZ shell has indeed been assumed to be plasmonic in\nnature with a Drude-like dispersion \u03b5 ENZ (\u03c9 ) = \u23a1\u23a31 \u2212 \u03c9 p2 / (\u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u0393 ) ) \u23a4\u23a6 \u03b5 0 , with \u03c9 p = 2\u03c0 \u22c5 600 THz and\n\u0393 = 10\u22123 \u03c9 p . In this way, we model reasonable dispersion and losses for a plasmonic material at\n\noptical frequencies [6]. In the figure three different possibilities are considered for the EVL core\n9\n\n\fmaterial: a positive \u03b5 EVL , and two different negative values for the core permittivity. In these latter\ncases the materials have also been assumed to have a Drude frequency dispersion with\ncorresponding ohmic losses. The values indicated in the figure insets correspond to the permittivity\nvalues at f p = 600 THz . In the three cases we obtain nano-wire behavior over a relatively wide\nrange of frequency centered at the plasma frequency of the shell material. The calculated low\nguided wave number Re [ \u03b2 ] and the low damping factor Im [ \u03b2 ] ensure the feasibility of the nanowire for optical nano-circuit applications. It is noted that a positive \u03b5 EVL guarantees a wider region\nof low Re [ \u03b2 ] , but slightly higher damping factors away from the plasma frequency of the ENZ\nmaterial. A more negative permittivity for the core material, still in the range of realistic values of\npermittivity at optical frequencies, as in the example with Re [\u03b5 EVL ] = \u2212100 , show better\nperformance, as expected. However, reasonable performance over a relatively wide bandwidth is\nalso obtained with a less negative permittivity. It should be noted how, for always positive Im [ \u03b2 ] ,\nthe sign of Re [ \u03b2 ] flips together with the sign of Re [\u03b5 ENZ ] at the plasma frequency f p . This is\nconsistent with the previous discussion on the possibility of forward and backward modes in this\nregime.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 3 \u2013 (Color online) Dispersion of the guided wave number for a nanowire with ashell = acore / 0.8 considering the\nfrequency dispersion of plasmonic materials. Solid black lines refer to the real part of \u03b2 and dashed red lines to its\nimaginary part.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 (Color online) Full-wave simulations [11] of: (a) distribution of the optical displacement current density on a\ntransverse cross section of the nanowire; (b) snapshot in time of the optical magnetic field distribution for a bent\nnanowire with the geometry of Fig. 1 (the length of the straight section is \u03bb0 and the radius of curvature of the bend is\n\n\u03bb0 / 2 ). Darker (brighter) colors correspond to higher values.\n\nFigure 4a shows the displacement current density \u2212i\u03c9\u03b5 EVL Ecore across a cross section of the nanowire of Fig. 1 obtained using numerical simulations, and Fig. 4b presents the magnetic field\ndistribution (a snapshot in time domain) for a bent geometry of such a wire. Since in the RF regime,\na metallic wire can still operate as intended, even when it is bent, here we show that this optical\n\"wire\" still functions with its interesting properties, when it is bent. Both figures reveal interesting\nfeatures of such an optical \"wire\", consistent with the findings described above. In Fig. 4a it is\nevident how the displacement current is all concentrated in the inner core of the nano-wire, similar\nto a classic shorting conducting metallic wire at lower frequencies. This is also confirmed by the\nfield distributions reported in Fig. 1, which shows a small longitudinal electric field component in\nthe core, and which resemble those of a classic wire carrying a uniform current. The ENZ shell in\nthis geometry indeed allows confining the displacement current inside the core with a very low\noptical potential drop (We note that despite the displacement current being high in the core region,\n11\n\n\fthe corresponding longitudinal electric field, which contributes to the potential drop along the wire,\nis very small due to the high value of permittivity of the core material).\nFig. 4b shows the full-wave simulation of a bent nanowire, demonstrating the striking guidance\nproperties of such an optical \"wire\". It can be seen how the mode is tightly guided around the subwavelength waveguide with a very low phase variation along the line. Despite the electrical length\nof the bent nano-wire shown in Fig. 4b, which is much longer than what would be required in nanocircuit applications, the phase delay along the wire is still negligible and the phase follows the nanowire despite its bend. Also the calculated potential drop along the nanowire is substantially lower\nthan the one expected along a similar electrical length in free-space or along a regular waveguide,\nsince the distribution of longitudinal electric field in the inner region is substantially lower than the\ntransverse electric field in the surrounding free-space (consistent with Fig. 1a).\nTo conclude, we have reported how the anomalous guiding properties of an EVL thin cylindrical\nnanowire surrounded by a thin ENZ plasmonic shell may act as an optical \"wire\" with interesting\npotentials in the framework of optical nanocircuit theory and nanoelectronics. The analysis\npresented here has also derived a closed-form solution for the complex guided wave numbers of this\noptical wire. Various methods for realization of this optical wire may be forecasted: one way may\nconsist of the use of sub-wavelength stacks of plasmonic and non-plasmonic materials, which,\ndepending on the orientation of the field, may act as effective ENZ or EVL materials (see, e.g., [7]).\nAnother possibility may be by utilizing a relatively high permittivity substrate: since the present\nanalysis has been developed relative to a generic background permittivity \u03b5 0 , it is expected that the\nuse of a relatively high-permittivity background may reasonably relax the requirements of a low\npermittivity for the ENZ shell.\n\nThis work is supported in part by the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) grant number N 00014 07-1-0622\n\n12\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[*]\n\nTo whom correspond should be addressed.
