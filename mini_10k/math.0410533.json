We assume that k\nis complete with perfect residue field. Let G be the group of k-rational points\nof a reductive, linear algebraic group defined over k. Let g denote the Lie\nalgebra of G. Fix r \u2208 R. Subject to some restrictions, we show that the set of\ndistinguished degenerate Moy-Prasad cosets of depth r (up to an equivalence\nrelation) parametrizes the nilpotent orbits in g.\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we give a uniform parametrization of the nilpotent orbits\nin the Lie algebra of a p-adic reductive group. This classification, which was\nmotivated by harmonic analysis considerations, matches nilpotent orbits with\ncertain equivalence classes that arise naturally from Bruhat-Tits theory.\n1.1. Motivation. In the early 1970s Harish-Chandra and Roger Howe studied the local behavior of the character of an irreducible smooth representation\nof a reductive p-adic group [13], [14]. For example, they established what\nis now called the Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion \u2013 in some\nunspecified neighborhood of the identity the character can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of the Fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals. At\nthe heart of their proofs was a remarkable finiteness statement, referred to\nas \"Howe's conjecture\" [15], about invariant distributions on the Lie algebra.\nIn some stunning work of the 1990s, J.-L. Waldspurger proved a very precise version of Howe's conjecture for \"unramified classical groups\" [28]. This\nsharpened finiteness statement allowed him to relate the range of validity for\nthe Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion to the first occurrence of\nfixed-vectors with respect to congruence filtration subgroups [25].\n\u2217 Supported by National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship 98-04375.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Bruhat and J. Tits [8], [9]\nto study questions in representation theory. One consequence of their work is\nthat to each representation we can attach a number, called the depth of the\nrepresentation. Roughly speaking, this number measures the first occurrence\nof fixed-vectors with respect to all the natural subgroup filtrations arising from\nBruhat-Tits theory. The conjecture of Thomas Hales, Allen Moy, and Gopal\nPrasad [22, \u00a71] seeks to strengthen the results of J.-L. Waldspurger by asking\nif the range of validity for the Harish-Chandra-Howe local character expansion\nis controlled by the depth of the representation; such a result would greatly\nenhance our understanding of characters. The parametrization of nilpotent orbits presented in this article is the cornerstone of my proof of their conjecture.\nThe remainder of the proof appears in [2], [11], [12].\n1.2. The parametrization. In a special situation (r = 0), the main result\nof this paper may be viewed as an affine analogue of Bala-Carter theory [4],\n[5]. Namely, it provides a classification of the nilpotent orbits in terms of\nequivalence classes of pairs (GF /G+\nF , X). Here F is a facet in the BruhatTits building of our group, GF is the associated parahoric subgroup with prounipotent radical G+\nF , and X is a distinguished element of the Lie algebra of\n+\nGF /GF . (Recall that X is called distinguished provided that it is nilpotent\nand does not lie in a proper Levi subalgebra.)\nIn this article we prove this special case (r = 0) and take it one step\nfurther \u2013 we classify the nilpotent orbits in terms of Moy-Prasad cosets of\nan arbitrary fixed depth r (see below). We now discuss the parametrization\nscheme in detail.\nLet k denote a field with nontrivial discrete valuation. We assume that k\nis complete with perfect residue field f. Let G denote the group of k-rational\npoints of a reductive, linear algebraic group G defined over k and let g denote\nits Lie algebra. We let G\u25e6 denote the group of k-rational points of the identity\ncomponent G\u25e6 of G. Let B(G) denote the Bruhat-Tits building of G\u25e6 . For\neach pair (x, r) \u2208 B(G) \u00d7 R, Allen Moy and Gopal Prasad [20], [22] have\ndefined the (Moy-Prasad) lattices gx,r+ \u2282 gx,r of g. For x \u2208 B(G), an element\nof gx,r /gx,r+ is called a Moy-Prasad coset of depth r.\nSuppose r \u2208 R. We partition B(G) into generalized r-facets \u2013 two points x\nand y in B(G) belong to the same generalized r-facet provided that gx,r = gy,r\nand gx,r+ = gy,r+ . If F \u2217 is a generalized r-facet and x \u2208 F \u2217 , then we define\nthe f-vector space VF \u2217 = gx,r /gx,r+ . For example, if r = 0, then generalized\n0-facets are facets in the usual sense, and if F is a facet of B(G), then VF is\nLie(GF /G+\nF ).\nLet Ir denote the set of pairs (F \u2217 , v) where F \u2217 is a generalized r-facet and\nv is an element of VF \u2217 . The set Ir parametrizes the set of Moy-Prasad cosets\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n297\n\nof depth r. In Section 3.6 we define on Ir an equivalence relation, denoted \u223c,\nwhich is a natural extension of the concept of associate [20], [22].\nA pair (F \u2217 , v) \u2208 Ir is degenerate if the coset it parametrizes contains a\nnilpotent element. Let Irn denote the subset of Ir consisting of degenerate\npairs. With some restrictions on k and G (see Section 4.2), we generalize a\nresult of Dan Barbasch and Allen Moy [6, \u00a73]. We show that to each element\n(F \u2217 , e) of Irn we can associate a unique nilpotent orbit O(F \u2217 , e). This orbit is\ncharacterized by the fact that it is the nilpotent orbit of minimal dimension\nhaving nontrivial intersection with the coset corresponding to (F \u2217 , e).\nThe set Irn is too large for our purposes. We therefore restrict our attention\nto the subset Ird of distinguished elements of Irn (see Section 5.5). For example,\nif r = 0, then (F, e) \u2208 I0n is distinguished if e is a distinguished element of\nVF = Lie(GF /G+\nF ) in the sense discussed above.\nWe now state Theorem 5.6.1, the main result of this paper. Let O(0)\ndenote the set of nilpotent orbits in g.\nTheorem. Assume that all of the hypotheses of Section 4.2 hold. There\nis a bijective correspondence between Ird / \u223c and O(0) given by the map which\nsends (F \u2217 , e) to O(F \u2217 , e).\nWe remark that this result is false without some restrictions on k and G.\nFor example, if k is the field of Laurent series over the field with two elements,\nthen for the group SL2 (k) the set I0d / \u223c has cardinality three, but O(0) has\ninfinitely many elements. On the other hand, if we are not interested in a\nproof which works in a general setting, then we can get by with less severe\nrestrictions. For example, we expect that the theorem is true for GLn (k) with\nno restrictions on k; if r = 0, then this is easy to verify. If we assume that the\nresidual characteristic of k is not two, then we expect that the result is valid\nfor split classical groups.\nIn the special case when r = 0, the parametrization scheme discussed\nin this article is inherent (though neither stated nor proved) in a paper of\nDan Barbasch and Allen Moy [6]. Magdy Assem pointed this out to Robert\nKottwitz who, in turn, pointed it out to me. Also in the case when r = 0,\nJ.-L. Waldspurger [27] develops a conjectural parametrization scheme similar\nto that given here but for unipotent orbits. He verifies his conjecture in a\nnumber of cases. Finally, if r = 0, k is the field of Laurent series over the\ncomplex numbers, and G is a connected, simple, adjoint, and k-split group,\nthen the main result of Eric Sommers' paper [23] is equivalent to the main\nresult of this paper; the proofs, however, are very different.\nI thank both Robert Kottwitz and Gopal Prasad for their many corrections and improvements to earlier versions of this paper. I thank Eugene\nKushnirsky and Gopal Prasad for allowing me to use their proofs (Lemma 4.5.1\nand Lemma 4.5.3, respectively).

Sally, Jr., and Jiu-Kang Yu. It is a true\npleasure to thank all of these people.\n\n2. Notation\n2.1. Basic notation. Let k denote a field with nontrivial discrete valuation \u03bd. We also denote by \u03bd the unique extension of \u03bd to any algebraic\nextension of k. We assume that k is complete and the residue field f is perfect.\nDenote the ring of integers of k by R and fix a uniformizer \u031f.\nLet K be a fixed maximal unramified extension of k. Let RK denote the\nring of integers of K and let F denote the residue field of K. Note that F is an\nalgebraic closure of f.\nIf f has positive characteristic, then we let p denote the characteristic of f.\nIf f has characteristic zero, then we let p = \u221e. Suppose n \u2208 Z. If p < \u221e, then\n(n, p) = gcd(n, p). If p = \u221e, then (n, p) = 1.\nLet G be a reductive, linear algebraic group defined over k. Let G\u25e6 denote\nthe identity component of G. Note the G\u25e6 is a connected, reductive, linear\nalgebraic group which is defined over k. We let G = G(k) and G\u25e6 = G\u25e6 (k).\nWe denote by g the Lie algebra of G. We let g = g (k), the vector space of\nk-rational points of g . Let (X, Y) 7\u2192 [X, Y ] denote the Lie algebra product for g.\nWe adopt the following conventions. We call a subgroup of G a parabolic\nsubgroup of G provided that it is a parabolic subgroup of G\u25e6 . Similar notation\napplies to tori and Levi subgroups.\nLet L be the minimal Galois extension of K such that G\u25e6 is L-split. As\nin [20], we define l = [L : K], and we normalize \u03bd by requiring \u03bd(L\u00d7 ) = Z.\nIf g \u2208 G and X \u2208 g, then g X = Ad(g)X. If X \u2208 g, then G X denotes the\nG-orbit of X in g. We let Xk\u2217 (G) denote the set of one-parameter k-subgroups\nof G.\nAn element X \u2208 g is nilpotent if and only if there exists \u03bb \u2208 Xk\u2217 (G) such\nthat limt\u21920 \u03bb(t) X = 0. Let N denote the set of nilpotent elements in g and\nlet O(0) denote the set of nilpotent G-orbits in g. It is more usual to say that\nan element is nilpotent if the Zariski closure of its G-orbit contains zero. Let\nN \u2032\u2032 denote the set of elements in g that are nilpotent in this sense. We will let\nN \u2032 denote the set of elements in g which contain zero in the p-adic closure of\ntheir G-orbit. It follows that N \u2286 N \u2032 \u2286 N \u2032\u2032 . From [18] we have N = N \u2032\u2032 if k\nis perfect. From [2] we have that if k is perfect or f is finite, then N = N \u2032 .\nSimilarly, we say that h \u2208 G is unipotent provided that there exists \u03bb \u2208\nk\nX\u2217 (G) such that limt\u21920 \u03bb(t)h(\u03bb(t))\u22121 = 1.\nAs in [24, \u00a72.2.1] a subset H \u0010of G is\u0011 bounded provided that for every\nk-regular function f on G, the set \u03bd f (H) is bounded from below.\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n299\n\n2.2. Apartments, buildings, and associated notation. Let B(G) denote the\n(enlarged) Bruhat-Tits building of G\u25e6 ; i.e., B(G) takes into account the center\nof G\u25e6 . We identify B(G) with the Gal(K/k)-fixed points of B(G, K), the\nBruhat-Tits building of G\u25e6 (K).\nFor \u03a9 \u2282 B(G), we let stabG (\u03a9) denote the stabilizer of \u03a9 in G.\nWe let dist: B(G) \u00d7 B(G) \u2192 R+ denote a (nontrivial) G-invariant distance\nfunction as discussed in [24, \u00a72.3]. For x, y \u2208 B(G), let [x, y] denote the geodesic\nin B(G) from x to y and let (x, y] denote [x, y] r {x}.\nFor a k-Levi subgroup M of G, we identify B(M, k) in B(G, k).

Thus, another application of (1) shows that\nthere exists k1 \u2208 Gkx such that k1 kz \u2208 FA (\u03b4). As FA (\u03b4) is convex, we have\n[k1 kx, k1 kz] \u2282 FA (\u03b4) \u2282 F \u2217 (\u03b4).\nSince F \u2217 (\u03b4) is stabG (F \u2217 )-invariant, we have [x, z] \u2282 F \u2217 (\u03b4).\nDefinition 3.2.12.

More generally, we will use the \"=\" notation whenever\ntwo objects are to be identified via this natural bijection.\nDefinition 3.5.3. If F \u2217 \u2208 F(r) and x \u2208 F \u2217 , then the image of Gx in\nAutf (VF \u2217 ) is denoted by Nx (F \u2217 ).\nLemma 3.5.4. Suppose Fi\u2217 \u2208 F(r) and xi \u2208 Fi\u2217 for i = 1, 2. If F1\u2217 and F2\u2217\nare strongly r-associated, then Nxi (Fi\u2217 ) is the image of Gx1 \u2229 Gx2 in Autf (VFi\u2217 )\nfor i = 1, 2. Moreover\ni\n\nNx1 (F1\u2217 ) = Nx2 (F2\u2217 )\nunder the identification of VF1\u2217 with VF2\u2217 introduced above.\nProof. We have that VFi\u2217 is the image of gx1 ,r \u2229 gx2 ,r in VFi\u2217 (= gxi ,r /gxi ,r+ )\nfor i = 1, 2. Let A be an apartment in B(G) containing x1 and x2 . Suppose\n\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8(A) such that \u03c8(x1 ) = 0 and the image of U\u03c8 in Autf (VF1\u2217 ) is nontrivial.\nSince the image of U\u03c8 is nontrivial, there exist X \u2208 gx1 ,r \u2229 gx2 ,r and g \u2208 U\u03c8\nsuch that g X 6= X mod (gx1 ,r+ \u2229 gx2 ,r+ ).\nWe now show that \u03c8(x2 ) = 0.\nIf \u03c8(x2 ) > 0, then g X = X mod gx2 ,r+ . Since g X \u2212 X \u2208 gx1 ,r , from\nLemma 3.5.1 we have g X = X mod (gx1 ,r+ \u2229 gx2 ,r+ ). We therefore conclude\nthat \u03c8(x2 ) \u2264 0.\nIf \u03c8(x2 ) < 0, then we let v denote the vector (x2 \u2212 x1 ). For all \u03b5 \u2208 R we\nhave x1 + \u03b5 * v \u2208 A. Consider the function\nfv : R \u2192 R\nwhich sends \u03b5 to \u03c8(x1 + \u03b5 * v). Note that fv (0) = 0 and fv (1) < 0. Since\n\u03c8 is affine, we have that fv (\u03b5) > 0 for all \u03b5 < 0. Since F1\u2217 \u2229 A is open in\nA(A, F1\u2217 ) = A(A, F2\u2217 ) and x1 + R * v is an affine subspace of A(A, F1\u2217 ), there\nexists an \u03b5 < 0 such that x1 + \u03b5 * v \u2208 F1\u2217 \u2229 A. Thus for some \u03b5 < 0 we have\nx1 + \u03b5 * v \u2208 F1\u2217 and U\u03c8 \u2282 G+\nx1 +\u03b5*v . Consequently, g \u2208 U\u03c8 acts trivially on\n+\ngF1\u2217 mod gF \u2217 .\n1\nWe therefore conclude that \u03c8(x2 ) = 0. Thus, if g \u2208 Gx1 has nontrivial\nimage in Autf (VF1\u2217 ), then it follows that we may assume that g \u2208 Gx1 \u2229 Gx2 .\nThe remainder of the lemma now follows.\nFrom Lemma 3.5.4 we have that if F \u2217 \u2208 F(r) and x, y \u2208 F \u2217 , then\nNx (F \u2217 ) = Ny (F \u2217 ).

From this data we manufacture an sl 2 (k)-triple in g which descends\nto our sl 2 (f)-triple.\nIn Section 4.5 we perform this process in reverse. That is, we start with\nan sl 2 (k)-triple in g and produce an x \u2208 B(G) such that our given sl 2 (k)-triple\ndescends to an sl 2 (f)-triple in Vx,\u2212r \u00d7 Vx,0 \u00d7 Vx,r .\n4.1.

Let S be the maximal f-split torus of Gx corresponding\nto S. Since maximal f-split tori are Gx (f)-conjugate, there exist \u03bc\u0304 \u2208 X\u2217 (S)\nand \u1e21 \u2208 Gx (f) such that limt\u21920 \u03bc\u0304(t)\u1e21 e = 0. Let \u03bc \u2208 X\u2217 (S) be the lift of \u03bc\u0304\nand let g \u2208 Gx be a lift of \u1e21. Let E \u2032 \u2208 gx,r = gF \u2217 be any lift of e.

The statements below list properties which I require; no attempt has been made to produce a minimal list of hypotheses. If\nwe assume that p is larger than some constant which can be determined by\nexamining the absolute root datum of G\u25e6 , then all of the hypotheses are valid.\nIn particular, if f has characteristic zero, then the following hypotheses always\nhold. Where appropriate, I have identified references where a discussion about\nthe conditions under which the hypothesis is valid may be found.\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n313\n\nWe begin by defining a finite-dimensional f-Lie algebra gx . Since we have\nfixed a uniformizer \u031f for k, for s \u2208 R and j \u2208 Z we have a natural identification\nof Vx,s with Vx,s+j*l. With respect to this identification, we define\n\ngx :=\n\nM\n\nVx,s .\n\ns\u2208R/l*Z\n\nNote that dimf gx = dimk g. We define a product operation on gx in the\nfollowing manner. If X s \u2208 Vx,s and X t \u2208 Vx,t , then we define [X s , X t ] to\nbe the image of [Xs , Xt ] \u2208 gx,(s+t) in Vx,(s+t) where Xs \u2208 gx,s and Xt \u2208 gx,t\nare any lifts of X t and X s , respectively. Linearly extend this operation to an\noperation on \u0010gx . \u0011With this product gx is an f-Lie algebra. For v \u2208 gx , define\nad(v) \u2208 Endf gx by ad(v)w = [v, w] for all w \u2208 gx .\nFor more information about Hypothesis 4.2.1, see Appendix A.\nHypothesis 4.2.1. Suppose x \u2208 B(G).

Moreover, there exists \u03bb\u0304 \u2208\nf\nX\u2217 (Gx ), uniquely determined up to an element of X\u2217 (Zx ) whose differential is\nzero, such that the following two conditions hold.\n1.

We now show that, subject\nto some conditions on k and G, there exist Y \u2208 gx,\u2212r , H \u2208 gx,0 and X \u2208 gx,r\nsuch that (Y, H, X) is an sl 2 (k)-triple in g and (Y, H, X) is a lift of (f, h, e) in\nthe obvious sense. We follow [6, \u00a7\u00a73.8\u20133.9] where the proof is carried out for\ncertain G when r = 0.\nLet S be a maximal k-split torus of G such that x \u2208 A(S, k). Let S be\nthe maximal f-split torus of Gx corresponding to S. Since maximal f-split tori\nare Gx (f)-conjugate, there exist \u03bb\u0304 \u2208 X\u2217 (S) and \u1e21 \u2208 Gx (f) such that \u03bb\u0304 = \u1e21 \u03bc\u0304.\nLet \u03bb \u2208 X\u2217 (S) be the lift of \u03bb\u0304 and replace (f, h, e) with (\u1e21 f, \u1e21 h, \u1e21 e).\nFor i \u2208 Z, define\n\ng(i) := {Z \u2208 g | \u03bb(t) Z = ti * Z} and gx (i) := {v \u2208 gx | \u03bb\u0304(t) v = ti * v}.\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n315\n\nFor i \u2208 Z and s \u2208 R define\n\ngx,s (i) := {Z \u2208 gx,s | \u03bb(t) Z = ti * Z} and Vx,s (i) := {v \u2208 Vx,s | \u03bb\u0304(t) v = ti * v}.\nBecause x \u2208 A(S, k), \u03bb \u2208 X\u2217 (S), and \u03bb\u0304 \u2208 X\u2217 (S) we have\n\ngx,s =\n\nM\n\ngx,s (i) and Vx,s =\n\ni\n\nM\n\nVx,s (i)\n\ni\n\nfor s \u2208 R and i \u2208 Z.\nLemma 4.3.1. Suppose that Hypothesis 4.2.1 holds. If X \u2208 gx,r (2) is any\nlift of e, then for all s \u2208 R, the map\nad(X)2 : gx,s\u2212r (\u22122) \u2192 gx,s+r (2)\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. Fix X \u2208 gx,r (2) which is a lift of e. Note that X is nilpotent. Since\nad(X)2 takes g(\u22122) to g(2) and k is complete, it will be sufficient to show that\nfor all t \u2208 R, the map\nad(e)2 : Vx,t\u2212r (\u22122) \u2192 Vx,t+r (2)\nis an isomorphism.\nFrom Hypothesis 4.2.1 we have that the space gx is a direct sum of irreducible (f, h, e)-modules. Consequently, it follows from sl 2 (f)-representation\ntheory that the map\nad(e)2 : gx (\u22122) \u2192 gx (2)\nis an isomorphism. The result follows.\nCorollary 4.3.2. Suppose that Hypotheses 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 hold. If\nX \u2208 gx,r (2) is a lift of e, then there exist lifts Y \u2208 gx,\u2212r of f and H \u2208 gx,0 of\nh such that (Y, H, X) is an sl 2 (k)-triple in g.\nProof. Fix X \u2208 gx,r (2) which is a lift of e. Since ad(X)2 : gx,\u2212r (\u22122) \u2192\ngx,r (2) is a surjection there exists Y \u2208 gx,\u2212r (\u22122) such that ad(X)2 Y = \u22122X.\nSince ad(e)2 : gx (\u22122) \u2192 gx (2) is injective and ad(e)2 f = \u22122e, Y is necessarily a\nlift of f . Let H = [X, Y ] \u2208 gx,0 (0). H is a lift of h. We also have [H, X] = 2X.\nWe need to check that [H, Y ] = \u22122Y .\nIt follows from Hypothesis 4.2.3 and Morosov's theorem (see [17, Lemma 7,\np. 98] or [10, the proof of Proposition 5.3.1; in particular, pp. 140\u2013141]) that\nthere exists Y \u2032 \u2208 g such that (Y \u2032 , H, X) is an sl 2 (k)-triple. Since H \u2208 g(0),\nX \u2208 g(2), and [g(i), g(j)] \u2282 g(i + j), we can assume that Y \u2032 \u2208 g(\u22122). However,\nsince ad(X)2 : gx,s\u2212r (\u22122) \u2192 gx,s+r (2) is injective for all s \u2208 R, we must have\nY\u2032 =Y.\n\n\f316\n\nSTEPHEN DEBACKER\n\n4.4.

The results of this\nsubsection may be thought of as natural generalizations of the material in\n[24, \u00a73.6].\nLemma 4.4.1. Suppose F is a codimension one 0-facet in B(M, K).\nEither every 0-alcove of B(G, K) which contains F in its closure belongs to\nB(M, K) or exactly two of the 0-alcoves which contain F in their closure lie\nin B(M, K).\nProof. Since F \u2282 B(M, K), there exists a maximal K-split torus T such\nthat T \u2282 M and F \u2282 A(T, K). Since \u03bb \u2208 X\u2217 (T), we can consider the image \u03bb\u0304\nof \u03bb in X\u2217 (GF ). Let C1 and C2 denote the 0-alcoves in A(T, K) which contain\nF in their closure. Let B denote the Borel subgroup of GF corresponding to C1 .\nFirst suppose that \u03bb\u0304 lies in the center of GF . Since every Borel subgroup\nof GF is conjugate to B by an element of GF , we conclude that every 0-alcove\nin B(G, K) which contains F in its closure is conjugate to C1 by an element\nof G(K)F \u2229 M(K).\nNow suppose that \u03bb\u0304 does not lie in the center of GF . Since the derived\ngroup of GF is either SL2 or PGL2 , it follows that there are exactly two\nBorel subgroups in GF containing \u03bb\u0304. These Borel subgroups correspond to C1\nand C2 .\nCorollary 4.4.2.\n\nSuppose that f has more than three elements. We\n\nhave\n\u00d7\n\nB(M ) = B(G)\u03bb(R ) .\n\nProof. \"\u2282\": Since any natural embedding of B(M ) into B(G) is M equivariant, this follows from the fact that \u03bb(R\u00d7 ) fixes B(M ) point-wise.\n\u00d7\n\"\u2283\": Suppose B(M ) ( B(G)\u03bb(R ) .

Note that\n\u03bb \u2208 X\u2217 (T). Since C does not lie in B(M, K), from the proof of Lemma 4.4.1\nwe conclude that the image of \u03bb in GF does not lie in the center of GF . Thus,\nsince the derived group of GF is either SL2 or PGL2 , we conclude that if the\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n317\n\ncardinality of f is greater than three, then the image of \u03bb(R\u00d7 ) in GF lies only\nin those Borel subgroups of GF corresponding to 0-alcoves in B(M, K). That\nis, with our restrictions on f, C cannot be fixed by \u03bb(R\u00d7 ).\nCorollary 4.4.3. Suppose the characteristic of f is not two. Let H =\nd\u03bb(1).

The\nset C is convex and contains B(M, K).\nSuppose that C 6= B(M, K). We will derive a contradiction. Since C is\nconvex and contains B(M, K), there exists a 0-alcove C in B(G, K) such that\nC\u0304 \u2229 B(M, K) has codimension one and H \u2208 g (K)c,0 for all c \u2208 C.\nChoose an apartment A in B(M, K) such that C\u0304 \u2229 B(M, K) \u2282 A.

Thus, since the\nderived group of GF is either SL2 or PGL2 and since the characteristic of f\nis not two, the image of H in Lie(GF ) lies only in those Borel subalgebras of\nLie(GF ) corresponding to 0-alcoves in B(M, K).

The group\nJ \u22ca Gal(K/k) acts on B(G, K). Moreover, since J \u22ca Gal(K/k) is bounded, its\naction has a fixed point [24, \u00a72.3.1]. Let x \u2208 B(G, K) be such a fixed-point.\nLet G denote the R-group scheme associated to stabG\u25e6 (K) (x) (see [9]).\nThe generic fiber G \u2297R k is G\u25e6 and the group of RK -rational points of G is\nstabG\u25e6 (K) (x). Let L(G) denote the Lie algebra of G. L(G) is a lattice in g\nand g (K)x,0 = L(G) \u2297R RK . Let J denote the R-group scheme associated\nto SL2 (RK ).

Distinguished cosets. We assume that all of the hypotheses of Section 4.2 hold.\nThe set Irn / \u223c is too large.

From Hypothesis 4.2.5, there exists a g \u2208 CG (X)\nsuch that Y \u2032 = g Y and H \u2032 = g H. Consequently, B(Y \u2032 , H \u2032 , X) = gB(Y, H, X).\nBy assumption, g\u22121 F \u2217 \u2282 g\u22121 B(Y \u2032 , H \u2032 , X) = B(Y, H, X) is not a maximal generalized r-facet in B(Y, H, X). Since dim g\u22121 F \u2217 = dim F \u2217 , this is a\ncontradiction.\nRemark 5.5.4. Suppose (Fi\u2217 , ei ) \u2208 Irn for i = 1, 2 and (F1\u2217 , e1 ) \u223c (F2\u2217 , e2 ).\nFrom Lemma 5.4.1 we have O(F1\u2217 , e1 ) = O(F2\u2217 , e2 ). From the proof above, we\nconclude that (F1\u2217 , e1 ) \u2208 Ird if and only if (F2\u2217 , e2 ) \u2208 Ird .\n5.6. A bijective correspondence. We assume that all of the hypotheses\nof Section 4.2 hold. In this subsection we establish the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.6.1. Assume that all of the hypotheses of Section 4.2 hold.\nThere is a bijective correspondence between Ird / \u223c and O(0) given by the map\nwhich sends (F \u2217 , e) to O(F \u2217 , e).\nProof. We have already seen that the map is well defined.\nWe first show that the map is injective. We need to show that if (F1\u2217 , e1 ),\n\u2217\n(F2 , e2 ) \u2208 Ird and O(F1\u2217 , e1 ) = O(F2\u2217 , e2 ), then (F1\u2217 , e1 ) \u223c (F2\u2217 , e2 ).\nIf O(Fi\u2217 , ei ) = {0}, then Fi\u2217 is open in B(G) and the result follows. Thus,\nwe may assume that ei is not trivial.\nFix xi \u2208 C(Fi\u2217 ). Complete ei to an sl 2 (f)-triple (fi , hi , ei ) \u2208 Vxi ,\u2212r\n\u00d7 Vxi ,0 \u00d7 Vxi ,r . From Corollary 4.3.2 we may lift (fi , hi , ei ) to an sl 2 (k)-triple\n(Yi , Hi , Xi ) in g. From Lemma 5.3.3 we have O(Fi\u2217 , ei ) = G Xi .\nSince O(F1\u2217 , e1 ) = O(F2\u2217 , e2 ), there exists a g \u2208 G such that (g Y2 , g H2 , g X2 )\n= (Y1 , H1 , X1 ). Consequently, since (Fi\u2217 , ei ) \u2208 Ird , from Lemma 5.1.4 we have\nthat F1\u2217 and gF2\u2217 are strongly r-associate. Thus, there exists an apartment A\nin B(G) such that\n\u2205=\n6 A(A, F1\u2217 ) = A(A, gF2\u2217 ).\nMoreover, since X1 has image e1 in VF1\u2217 and X1 has image g e2 in VgF2\u2217 , we have\nX1 \u2208 gF1\u2217 \u2229 ggF2\u2217 and\ni\n\ni\n\ne1 = g e2 in VF1\u2217 = VgF2\u2217 .\nThus, the map is injective.\nWe now show that the map is surjective. Suppose O \u2208 O(0).\nIf O is trivial, then let F \u2217 be an open generalized r-facet and let e be\ntrivial in VF \u2217 . We have (F \u2217 , e) \u2208 Ird and O(F \u2217 , e) = {0}.\n\n\f328\n\nSTEPHEN DEBACKER\n\nSuppose O is not trivial. Fix X \u2208 O. Complete X to an sl 2 (k)-triple\n(Y, H, X) in g. Let F \u2217 be a maximal generalized r-facet in B(Y, H, X) and\nlet e denote the image of X in VF \u2217 . We will be done if we can show that\nO(F \u2217 , e) = G X. This, however, follows from Lemma 5.3.3 (2).\nFor future reference, we record the following corollary of the proof of\nTheorem 5.6.1.\nCorollary 5.6.2.

F1\u2217 and gF2\u2217 are maximal generalized r-facets in B(Y, H, X).\nAppendix A. Some comments on Hypothesis 4.2.1\nA.1. Introduction. We will show that, subject to some conditions on k\nand G, Hypothesis 4.2.1 is valid. This result is related to material in [16] and\n[19, \u00a72] . No attempt has been made to produce an optimal set of conditions.\nFix x, r, and X as in the statement of Hypothesis 4.2.1. Without loss of\ngenerality, we assume throughout this appendix that G is connected.\nA.2. An sl 2 (f)-triple. In this subsection, we establish the existence of Y\nand H in g satisfying the requirements of Hypothesis 4.2.1.\nWe let g\u2032 (resp., z) denote the Lie algebra of the group of k-rational points\nof the the derived group of G (resp., the connected component of the center of\nG). From [3, Proposition 3.1] if p is larger than some constant which may be\ndetermined by examining the absolute root datum of G, then we may assume\nthat g = z + g\u2032 . Thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that G is\nsemisimple.\nWe claim that, under suitable conditions on k and G, the Killing form\n\u03ba identifies gx,s with g\u2217x,s for all s \u2208 R; in particular, for all Z \u2208 gx,s r gx,s+\nthere exists a W \u2208 gx,\u2212s r gx,(\u2212s)+ such that \u03ba(Z, W ) \u2208 R\u00d7 . Indeed, since gx,s\n[1, Proposition 1.4.1] and \u03ba behave well with respect to Galois descent, we may\nreduce to the case when G is k-split. If G is k-split, we can fix a Chevalley\nbasis for g . In this situation the statement follows if p is greater than some\nconstant which may be derived from the absolute root datum of G.\nRecall the definition of the finite-dimensional f-Lie algebra gx from Section 4.2. From the previous paragraph we see that, under suitable conditions\non k and G, the representation ad of gx has a nondegenerate trace-form. Let\ne \u2208 gx denote the image of X in Vx,r . From Hypothesis 4.2.3 we have that\nad(e)m = 0 for some m \u2264 (p \u2212 2). Thus from [10, Proposition 5.3.1] there\nexists an sl 2 (f)-triple (f, h, e) in gx completing e.\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n329\n\nWe claim that we may assume that f \u2208 Vx,\u2212r and h \u2208 Vx,0 . (We already\nknow that e \u2208 Vx,r .) Indeed, let f\u2212r denote the image of f under the projection\nof gx onto Vx,\u2212r \u2282 gx . Since e \u2208 Vx,r \u2282 gx , it follows that ad(e)2 f\u2212r =\nad(e)2 f = \u22122e. Let h0 denote the image of h under the projection of gx onto\nVx,0 . We have ad(e)f\u2212r = h0 and ad(e)h0 = \u22122e. From Morosov's theorem\n(see [17, Lemma 7, p. 98] or [10, the proof of Proposition 5.3.1; in particular,\npp. 140\u2013141]) there exists f \u2032 \u2208 gx such that (f \u2032 , h0 , e) is an sl 2 (f)-triple. Since\nh0 \u2208 Vx,0 , e \u2208 Vx,r , and [Vx,s , Vx,t ] \u2282 Vx,(s+t) for all s, t \u2208 R, we can assume\nthat f \u2032 \u2208 Vx,\u2212r . Thus we may assume that f \u2208 Vx,\u2212r and h \u2208 Vx,0 .\nConsequently, we can choose lifts Y \u2208 gx,\u2212r of f and H \u2208 gx,0 of h which\nsatisfy the initial requirements of Hypothesis 4.2.1. From Lemma 4.1.2 we may\nassume that Y is nilpotent. Thus from Hypothesis 4.2.3 we have that ad(f )m =\nad(e)m = 0 for some m \u2264 (p \u2212 2). Therefore, from [10, Proposition 5.4.8] we\nhave that gx is a direct sum of irreducible (f, h, e)-modules of highest weight\nat most (p \u2212 3).\nA.3. A one-parameter subgroup in Gx . We now wish to establish the exf\nistence of \u03bb\u0304 \u2208 X\u2217 (Gx ) satisfying the requirements of Hypothesis 4.2.1. We\ncontinue to use the notation introduced above, but we now remove the assumption that G is semisimple.\nSince h is semisimple, from [7, Proposition 11.8 and its proof] there exists\na maximal f-torus T of Gx such that h \u2208 Lie(T). Let T be a maximal K-split\nk-torus of G associated to T. (That is, we have x \u2208 A(T, K) and the image\nof T(K) \u2229 G(K)x in Gx (F) is T(F). That the torus T exists follows from the\nargument made in the final paragraph of the proof of [9, Proposition 5.1.10].)\nLet\nM\ng(F)x :=\ng (K)x,s /g (K)x,s+ .\ns\u2208R/l*Z\n\nAs in Section 4.2, we give g(F)x a natural Lie algebra structure; in fact, gx\nmay be identified with the set of Gal(F/f)-fixed points of the f-Lie algebra\ng(F)x . Since g(F)x decomposes into irreducible (f, h, e)-modules, it follows\nfrom [10, Lemmas 5.5.3 and 5.5.4] that there exists a one-parameter subgroup\n\u03bb\u03042 : GL1 \u2192 GL(g(F)x ) defined over f such that for v \u2208 g(F)x\nif \u03bb\u03042 (t) * v = ti v, then |i| \u2264 (p \u2212 3) and [h, v] = iv.\nFor \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6(T, K), we denote by (g(F)x )\u03b1 the (nontrivial) subspace of g(F)x\non which T acts by \u03b1. We define a linear map \u03bb2 from the K-root lattice in\nX\u2217 (T) to Z via \u03bb\u03042 . That is, for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6(T, K) we define h\u03bb2 , \u03b1i \u2208 Z by the\nequality\n\u03bb\u03042 (t) * v = th\u03bb2 ,\u03b1i v\nfor all v \u2208 (g(F)x )\u03b1 and extend linearly. Note that \u03bb2 is Gal(K/k)-invariant.\n\n\f330\n\nSTEPHEN DEBACKER\n\nFor i \u2208 Z, we define\nM\n\ng (K)(i) :=\n\ng (K)\u03b1 .\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6(T,K)\u222a{0};h\u03bb2 ,\u03b1i=i\n\nWrite g(i) for the Gal(K/k)-fixed points of g (K)(i). Let X \u2208 g(2) \u2229 gx,r\nbe any lift of e. Since \u1e21x decomposes into irreducible (e, h, f )-modules of\nhighest weight at most (p \u2212 3), we conclude that ad(e)2 : \u1e21x (\u22122) \u2192 \u1e21x (2) is\nan isomorphism (here \u1e21x (\u00b12) = {v \u2208 \u1e21x | ad(h)v = \u00b12v}). Thus, since k\nis complete, for all s \u2208 R the map ad(X)2 : g(\u22122) \u2229 gx,s\u2212r \u2192 g(2) \u2229 gx,s+r\nis an isomorphism (see also the proof of Lemma 4.3.1). Hence, there exists\nY \u2208 g(2) \u2229 gx,\u2212r such that ad(X)2 Y = \u22122X. Let H = ad(X)Y . Note that H\nis a lift of h and Y is a lift of f . We claim that (Y, H, X) is an sl 2 (k)-triple.\nFrom Hypothesis 4.2.3 and Morosov's theorem, there exists Y \u2032 \u2208 g such that\n(Y \u2032 , H, X) is an sl 2 (k)-triple. However, as usual, we conclude that we may\nassume that Y \u2032 = Y (see also the proof of Corollary 4.3.2).\nFrom Hypothesis 4.2.5 there exists a k-homomorphism \u03c6: SL2 \u2192 G such\n\u0010\n\nthat d\u03c6\n\n0 1\n0 0\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n= X, d\u03c6\n\n0 0\n1 0\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\none-parameter subgroup t 7\u2192 \u03c6\n\n\u0010\n\n= Y , and d\u03c6\nt 0\n0 t\u22121\n\n\u0011\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n\u0011\n\n= H. Let \u03bb denote the\n\n. Statements (1) and (2) of Hypothe-\n\nsis 4.2.5 along with Hypothesis 4.2.3 imply that for all v \u2208 g\n(*)\n\nif\n\n\u03bb(t) v\n\n= ti v, then |i| \u2264 (p \u2212 3) and ad(H)v = iv.\n\nFrom Corollary 4.5.9 we have x \u2208 B(CG (\u03bb)). Thus, there exists a maximal\nk-split torus S such that x \u2208 A(S, k) and \u03bb \u2208 X\u2217 (S). Let \u03bb\u0304 denote the image\nf\nof \u03bb in X\u2217 (Gx ). The image of d\u03bb\u0304 in Lie(Gx ) coincides with the one-dimensional\nsubspace spanned by h. From (*) and that fact that H is a lift of h we have\nthat for all v \u2208 \u1e21x\nif\n\n\u03bb\u0304(t) v\n\n= ti v, then |i| \u2264 (p \u2212 3) and ad(h)v = iv.\n\nFinally, we consider the uniqueness statement. Fix i \u2208 Z such that\n\u22122 \u2264 i \u0010\u2264 2. Note\nthat \u0010if m \u2208 N\n\u2208 gx such\u0011 that ad(h)v\n= iv,\n\u0011\n\u0011 and v \u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bb\u0304(t)\nm\ni+2m\nm\n\u03bb\u0304(t)\nm\ni\u22122m\nthen\nad(e) v = t\nad(e) v and\nad(f ) v = t\nad(f )m v .\nSince gx is spanned by the set of all vectors of the form ad(e)m v or ad(f )m v (m\nand v as above), we conclude that \u03bb\u0304 is uniquely determined up to an element\nof X\u2217 (Zx ) whose differential is zero.\nThe University of Chicago, Chicago, IL\nCurrent address: Harvard University, Cambridge, MA\nE-mail address: debacker@math.harvard.edu\n\n\fPARAMETRIZING NILPOTENT ORBITS\n\n331\n\nReferences\n\n[1] J.
