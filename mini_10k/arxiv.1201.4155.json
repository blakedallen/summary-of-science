Among them, the vector states \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4415),\nand \u03c8(4160), which are commonly assigned as \u03c8(3S),\n\u03c8(4S) and \u03c8(23 D1 ) respectively, can be directly produced through e+ e\u2212 annihilation into one photon, and\nthus can be readily detected at e+ e\u2212 colliders like\nBEPCII/BESIII [3] and CESR/CLEO.\nAside from these vector resonances themselves, it is\nalso interesting to detect the products via E1 transitions\nof these vector resonances into lower charmonium states.\nEspecially, the decay channels \u03c8(4040, 4160, 4415) \u2192\n\u2032\n\u03c7cJ \u03b3, J = 0, 1, 2 can be used to detect the 2P char\u2032\nmonia \u03c7cJ and to study the properties of these missing\nstates. The importance of experimental establishment of\nthese 2P charmonia consists in at least two aspects. On\n\u2032\none side, the properties of \u03c7cJ are important to clarify\nthe calculations in various potential models and coupledchannel models (see, e.g. [4] and references therein). On\n\u2032\nthe other side, the \u03c7cJ could be the candidates of some\nof the recently observed charmonium-like states, the socalled \"X,Y,Z\" states (for a review see e.g. [5]).\nAccording to potential model estimates, the spintriplet 2P states lie between 3.9 and 4.0 GeV in the\ncharmonium family [6\u20138]. Experimentally, five charmonium(like) resonances around 3940 MeV have been found\nrecently. The Z(3930) [9] observed by the Belle Collaboration in 2006 in the \u03b3 \u03b3 fusion experiment with\n\u2032\na mass 3929 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 2 MeV is identified with the \u03c7c2 .\nThe X(3915), which was also produced in the \u03b3 \u03b3 fusion experiment[10] and detected in the J/\u03c8 \u03c9 channel\n\u2032\nwith a mass about 3915 MeV, is possibly the \u03c7c0 [11].\nThe Y(3940) and Y(3915), which were detected in the\nB \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9K process by the Belle Collaboration [12] and\n\nthe BaBar Collaboration [13] separately are another can\u2032\ndidates for \u03c7c1,0 . The X(3940), which was found by the\nBelle Collaboration [14] in the recoiling spectrum of J/\u03c8\nin the e+ e\u2212 annihilation process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X and\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + DD\u0304\u2217 , seems not to be a 2P state [15, 16].\nAnother well known state, the X(3872), which was first\nfound in the J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in the\nB meson decay around 3872 MeV [17] with J P C = 1++ ,\nmight be interpreted as the D\u22170 D0 + c.c. molecule due to\nthe closeness of its mass to the D\u22170 D0 threshold. But its\nlarge production rate in p \u2212 p\u0304 collisions at the Tevatron\nand some properties seem to support that it could be a\n\u2032\ncompact bound state, such as the 2P charmonium \u03c7c1 ,\n\u2032\nor a mixture of the \u03c7c1 with the D\u22170 D0 + c.c. molecule,\ndespite of its lower mass. In fact, the mass of \u03c7c1 (2P )\ncan be lowered to below 3.9 GeV if the color screening\neffects and coupled channel effects are considered [4, 15].\nSo it is interesting to examine in the E1 transitions of\nhigher charmonia if the X(3872) can be seen by having\n\u2032\nthe \u03c7c1 component in its wave function.\nBecause of the phenomenological importance of the\n\u03c7\u2032cJ states mentioned above, we will study the production of these states in the E1 transitions of higher vector charmonia, say, \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415). The\nE1 transition width can be estimated by potential models. Various potential models predict various transition\nwidths. However, the transition widths of \u03c8(4415) \u2192\n\u2032\n\u03c7cJ \u03b3 are usually small because of the smallness of the\noverlap integral between the wave functions of 4S and\n2P states. On the other hand, the transition widths\n\u2032\nof \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7cJ \u03b3, are relatively large (tens to\nhundreds of KeV as those shown in Table I and Table II) and the corresponding branching ratios are about\n\u2032\n10\u22124 \u221210\u22123 . So the \u03c7cJ may be detected at the upgraded\nBEPCII/BESIII through these channels. Note that the\nE1 transition width depends on the phase space which is\n\n\f2\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndetermined by the mass of \u03c7cJ . Since the \u03c7c2 has been\nidentified with Z(3930), we can compare various poten\u2032\ntial model predictions with the experimental data of \u03c7c2\nto see if it can be detected in the E1 transitions of higher\ncharmonium states. This comparison may provide some\n\u2032\nhints in searching for the other two \u03c7cJ states.\nWe introduce three typical potential models in section\nII, and calculate in section III the E1 transition widths\n\u2032\nof \u03c8(4040, 4160, 4415) \u2192 \u03c7cJ \u03b3 with both lowest- and\nfirst-order wave functions in the non-relativistic expansion within these models. We discuss the possibility for\n\u2032\nproducing \u03c7cJ from E1 transitions of higher excited charmonium states and compare them with those \"X,Y,Z\"\nstates in section IV, where the effects of S-D mixing of\n\u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) on the E1 transition widths are also\nconsidered. A summary is given in section V.\n\nin the cc\u0304 system gradually becomes neutralized by the\nproduced light quark pair, and string breaking emerges.\nThe potentials in Model II [6] are:\nVV (r) = \u2212\n\n4 \u03b1C\n,\n3 r\n\nThere are many phenomenologically successful potential models in the literature. Among them the Cornell\nmodel [6](here we mark it by Model II) is well known,\nwhich describes the charmonium system quite well. However, the predicted masses of higher charmonium states\nseem to be larger than their experimental values [15]. A\n\u2032\ndistinct example is the mass of \u03c7c2 which is about 40\nMeV larger than the experimental value. The screened\npotential model (see Ref [15] and references therein)(here\nwe mark it by Model I) was proposed to lower the masses\nof higher charmonia. So we take it here to estimate the\n\u2032\nE1 transition production of \u03c7cJ . The third model we take\nwas proposed by Ding et al. [18, 19](here we mark it by\nModel III), in which the Coulomb potential has a running coupling constant. The Hamiltonian in these models\n~2\nP\n+ VV (r) + VS (r), where VV (r)\nhave the form of H = \u2212 m\nc\nis vector potential and VS (r) is scalar potential and mc\nis the mass of charm quark.\nThe potentials in Model I [15] are:\n\n\u03b1C = 0.5461, \u03bb = 0.1425GeV 2 , mc = 1.4794GeV\nThe potentials in Model III [18, 19] are\nVV (r) =\n\n8\u03c0 1 1 \u2212 \u039br\n, VS (r) = \u03bbr \u2212 C,\n25 ln(\u039br) 1 + \u039br\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bcr\nVS (r) = \u03bb(\n),\n\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the screening factor which makes the long\nrange scalar part VS (r) become flat when r \u226b \u03bc1 and\nstill linearly rising when r \u226a \u03bc1 , \u03bb is the linear potential\nslope, and \u03b1C is the coefficient of the Coulomb potential.\nThe model parameters are chosen following Ref [15]:\n\u03b1C = 0.5007,\n\u03bc = 0.0979GeV,\n\n\u03bb = 0.21GeV 2 ,\nmc = 1.4045GeV,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1C \u2248 \u03b1s (mc vc ) is essentially the strong coupling\nconstant at the scale mc vc . Here \u03bc is the characteristic\nscale for color screening, and 1/\u03bc is about 2 f m, implying\nthat at distances larger than 1/\u03bc the static color source\n\n(4)\n\nwith parameters\n\u039b = 0.47GeV,\n\n\u03bb = 0.22GeV 2 ,\nC = \u22120.975GeV.\n\n(5)\n\nThe potentials above are used to calculate the lowestorder and the first-order non-relativistic wave functions.\nFor the first-order relativistic corrections to the wave\nfunctions, we include the spin-dependent part of HSS ,\nHLS , HT and the spin-independent part HSI as perturbations.\nThe spin-spin contact hyperfine interaction is\nHSS =\n\n2 ~ ~ 2\nS1 * S2 \u25bd VV .\n3m2c\n\n(6)\n\nFor Coulombic vector potential, \u22072 ( 1r ) \u221d \u03b4 3 (~r) which\ngives too large a mass splitting of J/\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b7c , so we make\na substitution as in Ref.

From (7-10), one can see that the\ncorrections to the non-relativistic potential involve some\nderivative terms, which make the potential to be more\nattractive towards the origin. As a result, the wave functions with relativistic corrections will be thinner than\nthose without relativistic corrections. This effect usually\nreduces the spatial matrix elements < f |r|i > defined\nin (13), which can be seen directly by comparison between the results of \u0393(\u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7\u2032cJ \u03b3) listed in\nTable I and in Table II. However, the relativistic corrections can also change the node structures of the wave\nfunctions of higher exited states, such as \u03c8(4415), and\nmake the cancelation in the overlap integral between the\nwave functions of 4S and 2P states more modest, and this\ncan be seen in Table II. On the other hand, the transition width is proportional to the factor E\u03b33 , which favors\ninitial states with higher masses. Thus, the decay widths\n\u0393(\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c7\u2032cJ \u03b3) listed in Table II become larger. But\nwe should mention that these results are not very reliable\nand are more sensitive to the model details than those of\n\u0393(\u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7\u2032cJ \u03b3).\nWe calculate the E1 transition branching ratios of\n\u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160), and \u03c8(4415) with their total width\ntaken from PDG(2010) [22]. Since the errors of the total\nwidths are relatively small for these states, we only take\nthe central values of the total widths in calculating the\nbranching ratios and do not consider the errors.\n\ninvolves the initial and final state radial wave functions,\nand the angular matrix element Cf i is\nDISCUSSIONS ON XYZ STATES\n\nCf i = max(L, L\u2032 ) (2J\u2032 + 1)\n\n\u001a\n\nL\u2032 J \u2032 S\nJ L1\n\n\u001b2\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nWe are only interested in initial states with J P C =\n1 , i.e., \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4415) and \u03c8(4160), since they can\nbe easily produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation and can transit\ninto spin-triplet 2P states by emitting a photon.\nFor the masses of initial and final states used to calculate E\u03b3 in above three models, we take the central values\nfrom PDG(2010) [22] if the states are well established\n\u2032\nexperimentally. The mass of \u03c7c0 is supposed to be 3915\n\u2032\nMeV, while for the mass of \u03c7c1 we choose two different\nvalues: 3872 MeV and 3915 MeV.\nThe calculated results with lowest-order wave functions are listed in Table I. The results of Barnes, et al. [7],\nwhich are similar to the Model II and the results of Godfrey, et al. [8], with a relativized Cornell model, are also\nlisted in Table I for comparison. From Table I, one can\nsee that the widths \u0393(\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c7\u2032cJ \u03b3), are very small\ndue to large cancelation in the overlap integral between\nwave functions of 4S and 2P states, and therefore are\nvery sensitive to the model details.

Its mass, however, is\nabout 40-50 MeV larger than the commonly predicted\nvalue in the quenched potential model (see, e.g. [7]).\nA lower mass can be obtained by considering the color\nscreening effect described in Model I [15] in which the\npredicted mass is 3937 MeV.\nSince Z(3930) is established as the candidate of\n\u2032\n\u03c7c2 , searching for Z(3930) in the E1 transitions of\n\u03c8(4040, 4160, 4415) is important to further verify this assignment and can also be a good criterion in searching\nfor and identifying other \u03c7\u2032cJ states in these transitions.\n\n\u2032\n\n109\n164\n122\n122\n218\n271\n231\n231\n465\n515\n477\n477\n\nI\n56\n88\n37\n7.9\n9.2\n189\n117\n89\n42\n219\n174\n164\n\n\u0393thy (keV)\n\u2032\nII\n47\n72\n30\n6.2\n8.2\n169\n105\n81\n4.1\n116\n92\n105\n\nIII\n29\n50\n21\n5.3\n5.9\n147\n91\n97\n8.7\n30\n24\n22\n\n\u2032\n\nBrthy (\u00d710\u22124 )\n\u2032\n\u2032\nI\nII\nIII\n7.0\n5.9\n3.6\n11.0\n9.0\n6.3\n4.6\n3.8\n2.6\n0.99\n0.78\n0.66\n0.89\n0.80\n0.57\n18.3\n16.4\n14.3\n11.4\n10.2\n8.8\n8.6\n7.9\n9.4\n6.8\n0.66\n1.4\n35.3\n18.7\n4.8\n28.1\n14.8\n3.9\n26.5\n16.9\n3.5\n\u2032\n\nFrom Table I and Table II, we can see the transition\n\u2032\nwidth of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 is 36-74 KeV with the lowestorder wave functions and 29-56 KeV with the first-order\nwave functions in our calculations within Models I-III\nand in Ref. [8]. The corresponding branching ratio is 4.59.3\u00d710\u22124 and 3.6-7.0\u00d710\u22124, respectively. The branching\n\u2032\nratio of order of 10\u22124 is encouraging to detect \u03c7c2 in\n\u03c8(4040) E1 transitions. Note that the results of Ref. [7]\nis notably small than our results. This is mainly because,\n\u2032\nthe mass of \u03c7c2 used in Ref. [7] is larger than ours and\nthe corresponding energy of the emitted photon is much\nsmaller than ours.\n\u2032\n\nThe branching ratio of \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 is about one-\n\n\f5\n\u2032\n\nfifth of that of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 but is still close to\n\u2032\n1 \u00d7 10\u22124 . The branching ratio of \u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 is\nsensitive to the model details.

Y(3940) and X(3915) are also\nconsidered to be the same state in Refs. [10, 24\u201326].\nBesides whether they are the same particle or not,\nthere are no decisive interpretations of these states. That\nthey are detected in the J/\u03c8 \u03c9 channel but not in the\nDD\u0304 or DD\u0304\u2217 channel makes people suspect they are\nnot conventional charmonium states. Ref. [10] argues\nthat X(3915) is not an excited charmonium state but\nfavors the prediction of D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 bound state model [27].\nThe Y(3915) and Y(3940) are also interpreted as D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\nmolecular states by [28, 29].\nHowever, Liu et al. [11] pointed out that the node effect\nof excited wave functions may change the open charm decay widths dramatically. They calculated the open charm\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\ndecay of \u03c7cJ and \u03c7cJ in the 3 P0 model, and argued that\n\u2032\nX(3915) is the \u03c7c0 state.\nIf they are conventional charmonia, they are probably\n\u2032\nthe \u03c7cJ states since their masses are consistent with po-\n\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n\nand partial widths\n\n\u0393\u03b3\u03b3 \u00d7 B(X(3915) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c9) =\n+\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\ntotal widths\n\nThe X(3915) [10], Y(3940) [12] and Y(3915) [13] are\nall observed in the invariance mass distribution of J/\u03c8 \u03c9\nin processes\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 X(3915) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c9,\n\n(24)\n\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n\ntential model predictions [7, 8], and they have positive\ncharge parity since they decay to J/\u03c8 \u03c9.\nThe X(3915), which is observed in \u03b3\u03b3 fusion, may be\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c7c0 or \u03c7c2 . But the mass of X(3915) is about 2\u03c3 different\nfrom that of Z(3930) and from (17) and (30). Furthermore, if X(3915)is the same meson as Z(3930), we would\n\u2032\n\u2032\nget B(\u03c7c2 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c9)/B(\u03c7c2 ) \u2192 DD\u0304) \u2248 0.1 \u00b1 0.04, which\nseems to be too large for charmonium. So X(3915) is un\u2032\nlikely to be \u03c7c2 and we tend to regard it as a candidate\n\u2032\nfor \u03c7c0 .\nThe Y(3915), which is produced in B decays, has so\nclose mass and total width to the X(3915) that we suspect they are the same state. However, if Y(3915) is\n\u2032\nnot X(3915), then it may be \u03c7c1 . Since the E1 transition\n\u2032\nrate from \u03c8(4040) to \u03c7c1 is three to four times larger than\n\u2032\nthat to \u03c7c0 with both lowest-order and first-order wave\nfunctions if they have the same mass, we can distinguish\nbetween them by measuring these E1 transitions.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThe Y(3940) is unlikely to be \u03c7c1 . If it is \u03c7c1 , its\nmain decay mode ought to be DD\u0304\u2217 . However, Belle gives\nB(Y (3940) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c9)/B(Y (3940) \u2192 D0 D\u0304\u22170 ) > 0.71 at\n\u2032\n90% CL [30], which disfavor the \u03c7c1 assignment. But\n\u2032\nY(3940) might still be a candidate for \u03c7c0 .\nWe may detect and identify them in the E1 transitions of higher charmonium states. We can see from\nTable I and Table II that the transition widths are\n\n\f6\n\u2032\n\nO(10) KeV for \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c0,1 \u03b3 and O(100) KeV for\n\u2032\n\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c0,1 \u03b3, corresponding to branching ratios of\norder 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 , in all listed potential models. The\neffect of corrections of wave functions is moderate for\n\u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) transitions. The large branching\n\u2032\nratios may make the detection of \u03c7c0,1 possible.\n\u2032\nThe transitions of \u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c7c0,1 \u03b3 are model dependent and sensitive to the node structure, just like\n\u2032\n\u03c8(4415) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 as we have remarked.\nX(3872)\n\nThe X(3872) was first observed by Belle [17] in\nthe J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in B + \u2192\nK + J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay as a very narrow peak (\u0393X < 2.3\nMeV) around 3872 MeV. The mass of X(3872) in the\nJ/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode was recently updated by CDF Collaboration [31] as\nM (X(3872)) = 3871.61 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.19 MeV,\n\n(34)\n\nwhich is very close to the D0 D\u0304\u22170 threshold m(D0 D\u0304\u22170 ) =\n3871.81 \u00b1 0.36 MeV [32]. Moreover, analyzes both by\nBelle [33] and CDF [34] favor the quantum number\nJ P C = 1++ . The mass seems to be too small for a\n\u2032\nJ P C = 1++ \u03c7c1 charmonium, but the color-screening effects and the coupled channel effects may lower its mass\ntowards 3872 Mev [4, 15], as has been declared in Section\nI.\nThere are lots of possible explanations for\nX(3872)(see [15, 24] for a review). Aside from the\nmost popular one, i.e., the D0 D\u0304\u22170 molecular state,\nthe 1++ charmonium [15, 35, 36] or a mixed 1++\ncharmonium-D0 D\u0304\u22170 state [37, 38] for X(3872) was also\nproposed. More data samples are needed to distinguish\nbetween various explanations.\nRecently, an analysis of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 spectrum in\nthe decay B \u2192 KX \u2192 KJ/\u03c8\u03c9 performed by BaBar [39]\nclaimed that the J P C of X(3872) might disfavor 1++ , as\nhad widely been accepted, but favor 2\u2212+ . If this result\nis confirmed, the natural assignment is the 1 D2 charmonium \u03b7c2 . However, the mass of this D-wave state is\nabout 3.80-3.84 GeV in the potential models [6\u20138], which\nis too low to be the candidate of X(3872). Besides, some\nrecent theoretical studies on the properties of \u03b7c2 indicate\nthat it is not apt to the the candidate of X(3872) [40\u201343].\nTherefore, we will ignore this possibility in the following\nanalysis.\n\nWe are interested here in detecting X(3872) in the E1\ntransitions of higher charmonia, if X(3872) is the 2P charmonium \u03c7\u2032c1 or contains some 2P charmonium component\nin its wave function. One can see from Table I that the\n\u2032\nbranching ratio for \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3 is (0.93\u22121.89)\u00d710\u22123\n\u2032\nand that for \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3 is (2.04 \u2212 3.05) \u00d7 10\u22123 in\nour calculation with zero-order wave functions. The large\n\u2032\nbranching ratios may enable us to find \u03c7c1 in the e+ e\u2212\nmachines and compare it with X(3872). Note that Ref. [7]\nand Ref. [8] give smaller branching ratios. It is partly be\u2032\ncause they take a larger mass for \u03c7c1 in calculations. If\n\u2032\nthey take the mass of \u03c7c1 to be the same as us, the differences will diminish. This means the branching ratios\nare not sensitive to models. The calculated results with\nrelativistically corrected wave functions are a bit smaller\nbut still quite large (see Table II). It indicates that the\nresults are not sensitive to the nodes of wave functions\nand should be reliable.\n3S-2D Mixing\n\nThe \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) are commonly assigned as\n\u03c8(33 S1 ) and \u03c8(23 D1 ) respectively. Therefore, the above\nresults of E1 transitions are all based on these simple assignments. However, the observed leptonic width\n\u0393ee (4040) \u2248 \u0393ee (4160) is inconsistent with this picture.\nThe simplest explanation is that they are roughly 1:1\nmixtures of \u03c8(33 S1 ) and \u03c8(23 D1 ). Neither the tensor force nor the coupled channel effects can cause such\nstrong mixing (see Ref. [44] and references therein) and\nthe mixing mechanism remains unknown. Here we do not\nconsider the mixing mechanism, and simply assume that\nthey are mixtures of \u03c8(33 S1 ) and \u03c8(23 D1 ) with a mixing angle \u03b8, and calculate how the E1 transition widths\nvary with \u03b8. In this case, the \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) are\nexpressed as\n|\u03c8(4040)i = |33 S1 i cos \u03b8 + |23 D1 i sin \u03b8,\n|\u03c8(4160)i = \u2212|33 S1 i sin \u03b8 + |23 D1 i cos \u03b8.\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nUsing the data of leptonic decay widths of \u03c8(4040) and\n\u03c8(4160) [22] as inputs, one can determine the mixing\nangle \u03b8 in the potential models. It is about \u221235o or\n+55o in all the three models used in Sec. II. And this is\nconsistent with earlier estimates of the mixing angle[45,\n46]\nThe corresponding E1 transition widths parameterized\nby the mixing angle are\n\n\f7\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03b3) =\n\n\u221a\n4 2 3\n\u03b1ec k (cos2 \u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|33 S1 >2 \u22122 2cos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|33 S1 >< 23 P0 |r|23 D1 >\n27\n+2sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|23 D1 >2 ),\n\n\u221a\n4 2 3\n\u03b1ec k (cos2 \u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|33 S1 >2 + 2cos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|33 S1 >< 23 P1 |r|23 D1 >\n9\n1\n+ sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|23 D1 >2 ),\n2\n\u221a\n\u2032\n20 2 3\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n\u0393(\u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3) =\n\u03b1ec k (cos \u03b8 < 2 P2 |r|3 S1 > \u2212\ncos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P2 |r|33 S1 >< 23 P2 |r|23 D1 >\n27\n5\n1\n+ sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P2 |r|23 D1 >2 ),\n50\n\n(37)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3) =\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03b3) =\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\n\u221a\n4 2 3\n\u03b1ec k (2cos2 \u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|23 D1 >2 +2 2cos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|23 D1 >< 23 P0 |r|33 S1 >\n27\n+sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P0 |r|33 S1 >2 ,\n(40)\n\n\u221a\n4 2 3 1 2\n\u03b1ec k ( cos \u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|23 D1 >2 \u2212 2cos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|23 D1 >< 23 P1 |r|33 S1 >\n9\n2\n+sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P1 |r|33 S1 >2 ),\n(41)\n\u221a\n\u2032\n20 2 3 1\n2\n\u03b1e k ( cos2 \u03b8 < 23 P2 |r|23 D1 >2 +\ncos\u03b8sin\u03b8 < 23 P2 |r|23 D1 >< 23 P2 |r|33 S1 >\n\u0393(\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3) =\n27 c\n50\n5\n+sin2 \u03b8 < 23 P2 |r|33 S1 >2 ),\n(42)\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3) =\n\nWe use the lowest-order wave functions calculated in\nmodel I-III and impose m\u03c7\u2032c = 3929 MeV, m\u03c7\u2032c =\n2\n1\n3872 MeV and m\u03c7\u2032c = 3915 MeV. The results are similar\n0\nin the three models, i.e., the E1 transition widths reach\ntheir maximum or minimum values almost at the same\nmixing angle in the three models. As an example, we\ndisplay the results in Model I and Model II in Figs. 14, and do not show the similar results in Model III for\nsimplicity.\n\u2032\n\nWe see that the decay width of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c2 (3929)\u03b3\nreaches its maximum of about 75 KeV corresponding to a\nbranching ratio of 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 near \u03b8 = 10o . While the de\u2032\ncay width of \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c2 (3929)\u03b3 reaches its minimum\n(zero) near 10o and its maximum of about 600 KeV near\n\u221280o at which \u03c8(4160) is almost a pure \u03c8(33 S1 ) and the\ncorresponding branching ratio is about 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\u2032\n\nThe decay width of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c1 (3872)\u03b3 reaches its\nmaximum of about 250 KeV corresponding to a branching ratio of 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 near \u221235o , which is about 2\ntimes larger than that of non-mixing, and reaches its\nminimum (zero) near 55o . While the decay width of\n\u2032\n\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 (3872)\u03b3 reaches its minimum (zero) near\n\u221235o and reaches its maximum of about 1050 KeV corresponding to a branching ratio of about 1% near 55o . It\nis very interesting to note that the two values happen to\nbe corresponding to the mixing angles determined by leptonic decay widths of \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160). That means,\n\none of the two channels must be enhanced by the 3S-2D\nmixing if the mixing mechanism just affect the leptonic\ndecays and the E1 transitions by simply mixing the wave\nfunctions.\n\u2032\nThe decay width of \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c0 (3915)\u03b3 reaches its\nmaximum of about 52 KeV corresponding to a branching ratio of 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 near 55o , which is about 2.5\ntimes larger than that of non-mixing and reaches its\nminimum (zero) near \u221235o . While the decay width of\n\u2032\n\u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c0 (3915)\u03b3 reaches its minimum (zero) near\no\n55 and reaches its maximum of about 450 KeV corresponding to a branching ratio of about 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 near\n\u221235o.\n\u2032\nSince the decay width of \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c2 (3929)\u03b3\n\u2032\nreaches its minimum (zero) and \u03c8(4040) \u2192 \u03c7c2 (3929)\u03b3\nreaches its maximum near 100 , which is not far from the\nnon-mixing case, in our model calculations, we may use\nthese two channels to check whether there is substantial\n\u2032\n3S-2D mixing between \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160). If \u03c7c2 (3929)\ncan be detected in the E1 transitions from \u03c8(4040) but\nnot from \u03c8(4160), then the mixing angle should be small.\n\u2032\nIn general, since the Z(3930) is identified with \u03c7c2 , the observed E1 transition rates to Z(3930) from \u03c8(4040) and\n\u03c8(4160) will be useful to constrain the value of 3S-2D\nmixing angle by comparing the measurements and the\ntheoretical predictions.

So hopefully it is possible to\nmeasure them in experiment if the data samples are large\nenough. A special case is \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3 with a branching ratio of order 10\u22124 , which is quite large, and might\nbe easier to be detected. Again, if we have determined\n\u2032\nthe mixing angle, it would help us searching for \u03c7cJ and\nidentify the X,Y,Z resonances.\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we calculate the E1 transition widths\n\u2032\nand branching ratios of \u03c8(4040, 4160, 4415) \u2192 \u03c7cJ \u03b3 in\nthree typical potential models with both lowest- and\nfirst-order relativistically corrected wave functions. We\n\u2032\nfind the transition widths of \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7cJ are\nmodel-insensitive and relatively large (tens to hundreds\nof KeV) and the corresponding branching ratios are\n\u2032\nof order 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 , which make the search for \u03c7cJ\npossible at e+ e\u2212 colliders such as BEPCII/BESIII and\nCESR/CLEO. This may help us identify some of the recently discovered X,Y,Z particles, especially the X(3915),\nY (3915), Y (3940) and X(3872). The possible 3S-2D\nmixing of \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160) and its effect on the\n\u2032\ntransition widths of \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7cJ \u03b3 are considered and found to be important. We find the transitions\n\u2032\n\u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7c2 \u03b3 can be used to examine whether\nthe mixing exists and to further possibly constrain the\n\u2032\nmixing angle; and the transitions \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3\n\u2032\nand \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03b3 can be used to estimate how\nfar is the mixing angle from \u221235o and 55o, which are determined in a simple 3S-2D mixing model by the observed\nleptonic decay widths of \u03c8(4040) and \u03c8(4160). The transitions of \u03c8(4040, 4160) \u2192 \u03c7cJ (1P )\u03b3 are also discussed,\nand the \u03c8(4160) \u2192 \u03c7c1 \u03b3 transition is found to have a\nbranching ratio of order of 10\u22124 , which may be relatively\neasier to be detected.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe would like to thank Chang-Zheng Yuan for many\nvaluable discussions.
