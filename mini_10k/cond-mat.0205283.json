Doliwa1 and A. Heuer2\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0205283v2 [cond-mat.soft] 2 Jan 2003\n\nMax Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany and\n2\nInstitute of Physical Chemistry, University of M\u00fcnster - M\u00fcnster, Germany\n(Dated: October 26, 2018)\nWe investigate the jump motion among potential energy minima of a Lennard-Jones model glass\nformer by extensive computer simulation. From the time series of minima energies, it becomes clear\nthat the energy landscape is organized in superstructures, called metabasins. We show that diffusion\ncan be pictured as a random walk among metabasins, and that the whole temperature dependence\nresides in the distribution of waiting times. The waiting time distribution exhibits algebraic decays:\n\u03c4 \u22121/2 for very short times and \u03c4 \u2212\u03b1 for longer times, where \u03b1 \u2248 2 near Tc . We demonstrate that\nsolely the waiting times in the very stable basins account for the temperature dependence of the\ndiffusion constant.\n\nThe energy landscape picture proposed more than\nthirty years ago by Goldstein [1] has turned out to be a\nfruitful way of describing the complicated many-particle\neffects in disordered systems [2]. Starting from the joint\npotential energy landscape (PEL) V (x) of N particles\nas a function of their configuration x = {x1 , ...xN } one\nexpects that the properties of the system at sufficiently\nlow temperatures will be dominated by long residences\nnear local minima of V (x) (inherent structures) with\nrare hopping events between them [3]. Recently it became clear for a model glass former that the strict hopping picture approximately holds for T < Tc (landscapedominated regime) [4, 5, 6] where Tc is the mode-coupling\ntemperature [7]. However, even for higher temperatures\nT < 2Tc many dynamic properties are still related to the\nproperties of inherent structures (landscape-influenced\nregime) [8, 9, 10]. Thus, in both temperature intervals\nan observable like the diffusion constant D(T ) should depend on the topography of inherent structures (IS) or,\nmore generally, of basins (a basin of an inherent structure is defined as the set of configurations that reach this\nminimum via steepest descent [11]). Such an understanding is indispensable to grasp the underlying physics of the\nAdam-Gibbs relation [12, 13].\nA simplified picture of glassy dynamics has been expressed in phenomenological models in [14, 15, 16] based\non spatially uncorrelated hopping processes (randomwalk) in configuration space. Then the whole temperature dependence is contained in the average waiting\ntime h\u03c4 (T )i. The true dynamics of glass forming systems, however, is expected to be more complicated. For\nexample it is known that back- and forth correlations\ncannot be neglected and that the elementary jump distances depend on temperature [17, 18]. In general, in\na hopping approach the temperature dependence of the\ndiffusion constant may be related to spatial and temporal\naspects, as expressed by the relation\nD(T ) =\n\na2 (T )\n.\n6N h\u03c4 (T )i\n\n(1)\n\nWith this ansatz, we anticipate the important role of\nthe mean waiting time and collect the spatial details of\nhopping in an effective jump width a(T ). The latter\ninvolves (i) the average jump distance, (ii) correlations\nof jump widths with waiting times, and (iii) directional\ncorrelations of successive jumps. To our knowledge this\ndecomposition into spatial and temporal contributions\nhas not been systematically implemented within the PEL\nframework so far. A priori it is not clear to which degree the temperature dependence of a(T ) is relevant; see,\ne.g., [19, 20]. Some information about the waiting time\ndistribution (WTD) has already been gained from the\nanalysis of hopping processes of single particles in real\nspace via computer simulations [21, 22]. In contrast, we\nconsider hopping in configuration space, with the advantage of incorporating the full many-particle effects [23].\nIn this paper, we present detailed information about\nthe spatial and temporal aspects of hopping in a\nmodel glass former, and individually determine a(T )\nand h\u03c4 (T )i. We demonstrate that (i) only h\u03c4 (T )i depends on temperature, (ii) hopping among single basins\nis not a random walk, whereas hopping among superstructures of minima (metabasins) is close to a random\nwalk, (iii) h\u03c4 (T )i is dominated by the long waiting times,\ndue to a slow (approximately algebraic) decay of WTDs.\nIn the present work, we investigate a binary mixture\nof Lennard-Jones particles (BMLJ), as recently treated\nby two groups [6, 24]; see also [25]. It is characterized\nby the interaction potentials V\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = 4\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 [(\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 /r)12 \u2212\n(\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 /r)6 ] with the parameter set N = NA + NB = 52 +\n13 = 65, \u03c3AB = 0.8\u03c3AA , \u03c3BB = 0.88\u03c3AA , \u01ebAB = 1.5\u01ebAA ,\n\u01ebBB = 0.5\u01ebAA , rc = 1.8\u03c3AA . Linear functions were added\nto the potentials to ensure continuous forces and energies at the cutoff rc . Units ofplength, mass, energy, and\n2 /\u01eb\ntime are \u03c3AA , m, \u01ebAA , and m\u03c3AA\nAA , respectively.\nFor convenience, though, we will omit units here. We\nuse Langevin molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with\nfixed step size, \u03bb2 = 0.0152 = 2kB T \u2206t/m\u03b6, equal particle masses m, friction constant \u03b6, and periodic boundary\nconditions at a density of \u03c1 = 1.2. The friction constant\n\n\f2\n\u03b6 = 2/0.0152 is chosen so that \u2206t = 1/T . Due to the different type of dynamics, the absolute values of times and\ndiffusion constants are different from those found within\nNewtonian dynamics simulations. The mode-coupling\ntemperature is Tc = 0.45 \u00b1 0.01 in this model system\n(compare [25]).\nFor the analysis of dynamics in configuration space it\nis essential to use small systems because otherwise many\ninteresting effects will be averaged out [10]. The relevance of small systems has been also pointed out by other\ngroups; see, e.g. [23, 26]. On the other hand, the system\nshould not be too small in order to avoid major finite\nsize effects. N \u2248 60 turns out to be a very good compromise for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures, whereas N \u2264 40\nalready displays major finite-size effects [27]. Here we\nchoose N = 65. To back those findings,we have carried\nout an extensive study of finite-size effects for systems\nof N = 65, 130, and N = 1000 particles [28]. It turned\nout that the N = 65 system is nearly identical to the\nbulk (N = 1000) above Tc . Since well-equilibrated runs\nof N \u2265 130 are lacking below Tc , finite-size effects cannot be excluded there at the present stage. However,\nthis does not affect the main results of this paper. More\nimportant is the question of good equilibration at each\ntemperature. Have the runs been long enough to sample the PEL sufficiently? Above Tc this is uncritical,\nwhich can be seen from the fact that each run comprised\nat least 850 \u03b1-relaxation times. A more detailed check,\ninvolving the lifetimes and distribution of metabasins, indicates that runs down to T = 0.435 are feasible with the\navailable computer power.\nBy regular quenching the MD trajectory x(t) to the\nbottom of the basins visited at time t, as proposed by\nStillinger and Weber, we obtain a discontinuous trajectory \u03be(t). In this way, one discards the more or\nless complicated vibrational part x(t) \u2212 \u03be(t) of motion,\nonly keeping the visited minima as 'milestones'. The\none-particle diffusion constant can be also determined\nfrom the squared displacement of inherent structures via\nD = limt\u2192\u221e (\u03be(t) \u2212 \u03be(0))2 /6N t.\nHow to resolve the elementary hopping events? Since\ncomputer time prohibits to calculate \u03be(t) for every time\nstep, we normally find ourselves in the situation of having equidistant quenched configurations \u03be(ti ), with, say,\nti+1 \u2212 ti \u223c 105 MD steps. If the same minimum is found\nfor times ti and tj , we need not care about transitions in\nthe meantime, because no relaxation has occurred there.\nIf, in contrast, \u03be(ti ) 6= \u03be(ti+1 ), we must not expect \u03be(ti+1 )\nto be the direct successor of \u03be(ti ), since many other minima could have been visited between ti and ti+1 . Therefore, further minimizations in this time interval are necessary. For reasons of efficiency, we apply a straightforward\ninterval bisection method, which locates all relevant transitions with an accuracy of 1 MD step. Although computationally demanding, this has proven most efficient for\nresolving the relevant details of hopping on the PEL.\n\nFIG. 1: The time series of minima energies measured for\nthe BMLJ system of N = 65 particles, T = 0.435. The\ndistance between minimizations before interval bisection is\n105 MD Steps. The length of the total run is 2\u00d7109 MD Steps.\nTop: time window covering a quarter of the total run. Bottom: magnification by a factor of fifty.\n\nAs demonstrated in [10], the time series of potential\nenergies \u01eb(t) = V (\u03be(t)) reflects well the character of dynamics in the supercooled state. For T = 0.435, \u01eb(t) is\nshown in Fig. 1 from which we note a remarkable structure in \u01eb(t). The system is trapped in some stable configurations for long times, during which a small number of\nminima is visited over and over again. Obviously, these\nminima form superstructures, which, following [3], we denote metabasins (MBs). One may imagine that minima\nof long-lived MBs are organized in funnel-like structures\nso that the system is stuck there for a long time. It has\nbeen argued that the occurrence of \u03b2-relaxation at low\ntemperatures is due to such substructure of the PEL [3].\nThis is supported by the real-space signature of MBs as\nreported by Middleton and Wales [29]. Formally there is\nno unique way to define MBs for a given PEL due to the\nlack of a strict time scale separation. Here we take the\npragmatic view and let the system decide by its MD run.\nThe intuitive notion of MBs from Fig. 1 can be cast into\nan algorithm in a straightforward way, see [10] [36]. One\nmajor advantage of analyzing MBs rather than basins is\nthat the charming simplistic picture of a random walk\nin configuration space will be better fulfilled since direct\n\n\f3\n\n1000.0\n\nT\n0.435\n0.466\n0.5\n0.6\n0.8\n2.0\n\n100.0\n\na2(T)\n0.9\n1.1\n1.0\n1.1\n0.9\n0.3\n\n<R2(n)>\n\nlog10 1/D(T)\nbasins\n\nMBs\n\n8\n\nlog10<\u03c4(T)>+log10 6N/a2\n\n6\n\n10.0\n1.0\n\n4\nnumber of transitions\n\n0.1\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nn\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 2: Squared displacement R2 (n) after n MB jumps\nfor the temperatures T = 0.435, 0.466, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 2.0.\nAlso shown are three curves (T = 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8) for jumps\namong single basins (lower curves). The latter data have been\nobtained by extremely frequent minimizations, which resolve\nnearly all IS transitions. We have included lines of slope 1.\n\nback- and forth correlations are already taken into account. It turns out (see Fig. 1) that long-lived stable\nMBs are separated by bursts of rapid transitions among\nhigher minima which look like fountains. They cannot be\ndetected without interval bisection. The waiting times of\nthe MBs range from a few MD steps to many millions of\nthem. Moreover, comparing Fig. 1 (a) and (b), we find\na certain self-similarity in \u01eb(t) when inspected on different time scales. The distribution of MB lifetimes \u03c4 will\nbe denoted \u03c6(\u03c4, T ), its first moment h\u03c4 (T )i being a key\nquantity for the following considerations.\nOur goal is to find an expression for the effective jump\nwidth a(T ) of Eq. (1). To this end, as a generalization\nof \u03be(t), we define the MB inherent structure \u03beMB (t) as\nthe mean of \u03be(t) over the MB lifetime. The key idea\nnow is to introduce the squared distance R2 (n) after\nn jumps [30], averaged over different realizations. This\nquantity is purely spatial since it does not involve any\ntime scale. In the limit of large n one obtains due to the\n2\ncentral limit theorem limn\u2192\u221e hR2 (n)i/h\u03beMB\n(n h\u03c4 i)i = 1\n2\nwhere h\u03beMB (n h\u03c4 i)i is the average squared displacement\nafter time n h\u03c4 i. Thus,\n#\n\"\n2\nR2 (n)\n\u03beMB\n(n h\u03c4 i)\n1\n= lim\nD(T ) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\n6N n h\u03c4 i\n6n\nN h\u03c4 i\nwhere the first factor may be identified as a2 (T )/6. Note\nthat both factors are independent of system size because\nIS transitions are localized ( R2 (1) = O(1)) and mean\nwaiting times decrease with system size (h\u03c4 i = O(1/N )).\nWe may now calculate a(T ) from the simulations, results are shown in Fig. 2. The most important observation is that a(T ) is temperature independent for\nT < 1. Interestingly, this is not affected by the variation\n\n1/T\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nFIG. 3: Arrhenius plot of the inverse one-particle diffusion\nconstant 1/D(T ) and the mean waiting time h\u03c4 (T )i multiplied\nby a constant (a2 = 1.0). Error bars are of the order of the\nsymbol size.\n\nof the elementary jump width R2 (1) , which increases\nwith temperature, a fact that was recently observed by\nSchulz et al. [18]. A possible explanation for this might\nbe found in the increasing population of higher-order stationary points [5], which are known to be more distant\nto neighboring minima, but also provoke many 'bookkeeping' IS transitions, thus resulting in larger backward\ncorrelations [23].\nIn any event, the constancy of a(T ) in the landscapeinfluenced regime T < 1 implies that the temperature dependence of D(T ) follows alone from h\u03c4 (T )i, i.e.\nD(T ) \u221d 1/ h\u03c4 (T )i. This simple picture breaks down for\nT > 1 where the explored regions of configuration space\nprobably have a completely different structure. It has\nto be noted that the constancy of a(T ) for low T relies\nheavily on our resolution of all elementary IS transitions\nleading to relaxation.\nA further insight from Fig. 2 is that the dynamics on\nthe level of MBs is basically a random walk except for minor back-correlations for n \u2264 5. As seen from the figure,\nthese correlations are present between single basins, the\nconsequence being a significant deviation from the relation R2 (n) \u221d n. Also note the oscillations in the singlebasin R2 (n) at small n, which result from the backand-forth motion within MBs. More importantly, the\nsingle-basin curves do not have the same large-n limit so\nthat the effective jump length on the level of single basins\nwould be temperature dependent. It remains unclear why\nfor a very small LJ system (N = 32) correlations among\nadjacent basins are irrelevant for T \u2248 Tc [23], and why\nintra- rather than inter-basin dynamics is deemed to be\nthe key to the understanding of diffusion [31].\nWe can check the relation D \u221d 1/ h\u03c4 i within our simulations. Figure 3 shows that it is indeed well fulfilled for\nT < 1 while for T = 2 we find the expected deviations.\n\n\f4\n\n\u03c4-2\n\n0\n\nlog10\u03c6(\u03c4)\n\n\u03c4-1/2\n\n-5\n2.4\n\nTc=0.45\n\n2.2\n2.0\n\n-10\n\n1.8\n\nlog10\u03c4\n\n0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 4: Distributions of waiting times, \u03c6(\u03c4, T ), for T =\n1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.435 (from left to right).

As we have seen, the\nemergence of long-lived MBs is the reason for the slowing down of molecular motion in our supercooled model\nliquid. As a next step the waiting time should be related\nto the respective MB energies to establish a connection\nbetween energy (thermodynamics) and dynamics in the\nspirit of the Adam-Gibbs relation (see the subsequent\npaper [35]).\nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with\nJ.P.

For short \u03c4 ,\nall curves exhibit a power-law behavior with exponent\n\u22121/2, similarly to [32]. At \u03c4 \u2248 103 \u2212 104 a crossover\nto the faster decay \u03c6(\u03c4, T ) \u221d \u03c4 \u2212\u03b1(T ) can be observed.\nFor T \u2248 0.45, one finds \u03b1 \u2248 2.0 for which the expectation value h\u03c4 i would diverge. However, the behavior\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 \u2212\u03b1 cannot extend to infinity. Due to the finite\nnumber of MBs in the system, there exists a maximum\neffective barrier Emax , giving rise to an exponential cutoff\nat some minimum rate \u03b3min .\nThe slow decay of the WTDs leads to the important\nobservation that the mean waiting time h\u03c4 i is dominated\nby the contributions from large \u03c4 (see arrows in figure 4).\nFor example at T = 0.435, ninety percent of h\u03c4 i are made\nup by the six percent longest waiting times, which are\nbasins of lifetimes greater than 0.5 \u00d7 106 MD Steps. This\nmay come as a surprise because (i) the short-lived MBs\nare much more numerous than the long-lived and (ii)\none might intuitively think that the diffusion constant\nand thus h\u03c4 i is dominated by the fast particles. The\nresult is in qualitative agreement with the approach of\nWolynes and Xia who regard the relaxation of long-lived\nlocal structures as the time-determining step [33].\nInterestingly, the algebraic decay of the WTDs follows for some theoretical models of diffusion with built-in\ntraps. This is the case for Bouchaud's trap model [16] and\nthe trapping diffusion model of Odagaki et al. [15]. A recent comparison of WTDs in the Lennard-Jones system\nwith that of trap models can be found in [34].\nIn conclusion, the detailed analysis of hopping on the\n\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n\nM.
