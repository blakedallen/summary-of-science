R. K. Guy presented in [1] some\nresults on this conjecture; Carmicha\u00ebl himself proved that, if n0 does not verify his\nconjecture, then n0 > 10 37 ; V. L. Klee [2] improved to n0 > 10 400 , and P. Masai & A.\nValette increased to n0 > 1010000 . C. Pomerance [4] wrote on this subject too.\nIn this article we prove that the equation \u03c6 (x) = n admits a finite number of\nsolutions, we find the general form of these solutions, also we prove that, if x0 is the\nunique solution of this equation (for a n \u2208 N ), then x0 is a multiple of 2 2 \u22c5 32 \u22c5 7 2 \u22c5 432\n(and x0 > 1010000 from [3]).\nIn the last paragraph we extend the result to: x0 is a multiple of a product of a\nvery large number of primes.\n\u00a71. Let x0 be a solution of the equation \u03c6 (x) = n . We consider n fixed. We'll try\nto construct another solution y0 \u2260 x0 .\nThe first method:\nWe decompose x0 = a \u22c5 b with a, b integers such that (a, b) = 1.\nwe look for an a ' \u2260 a such that \u03c6 (a ') = \u03c6 (a ) and (a', b) = 1; it results that\ny0 = a '\u22c5 b .\nThe second method:\nLet's consider x0 = q1\u03b21 ...qr\u03b2r , where all \u03b2i \u2208 N* , and q1 ,..., qr are distinct primes\ntwo by two; we look for an integer q such that (q, x0) = 1 and \u03c6 (q ) divides\nx0 / (q1 ,..., qr ) ; then y0 = x0 q / \u03c6 (q ) .\nWe immediately see that we can consider q as prime.\nThe author conjectures that for any integer x0 \u2265 2 it is possible to find, by means\nof one of these methods, a y0 \u2260 x0 such that \u03c6 ( y0 ) = \u03c6 ( x0 ) .\nLemma 1. The equation \u03c6 ( x ) = n admits a finite number of solutions, (\u2200 )n \u2208 N .\nProof. The cases n = 0,1 are trivial.\n\n1\n\n\fLet's consider n to be fixed, n \u2265 2 . Let p1 < p2 < ... < ps \u2264 n + 1 be the sequence\nof prime numbers. If x0 is a solution of our equation (1) then x0 has the form\n\nx0 = p1\u03b11 ... ps\u03b1 s , with all \u03b1 i \u2208 N . Each \u03b1 i is limited, because:\n(\u2200)i \u2208 {1, 2,..., s} , (\u2203)ai \u2208 N : pi\u03b1i \u2265 n .\nWhence 0 \u2264 \u03b1 i \u2264 ai + 1 , for all i . Thus, we find a wide limitation for the number of\ns\n\nsolutions:\n\n\u220f (a + 2)\ni =1\n\ni\n\nLemma 2. Any solution of this equation has the form (1) and (2):\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5s\n\n\u239b p1 \u239e 1 \u239b ps \u239e\nx0 = n \u22c5 \u239c\n\u239f \u2208Z ,\n\u239f .... \u239c\n\u239d p1 \u2212 1 \u23a0\n\u239d ps \u2212 1 \u23a0\nwhere, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s , we have \u03b5 i = 0 if \u03b1 i = 0 , or \u03b5 i = 1 if \u03b1 i \u2260 0 .\n\u03b5s\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u239b p \u239e1 \u239b p \u239e\nOf course, n = \u03c6 ( x0 ) = x0 \u239c 1 \u239f .... \u239c s \u239f ,\n\u239d p1 \u2212 1 \u23a0\n\u239d ps \u2212 1 \u23a0\nwhence it results the second form of x0 .\nFrom (2) we find another limitation for the number of the solutions: 2 s \u2212 1\nbecause each \u03b5 i has only two values, and at least one is not equal to zero.\n\u00a72. We suppose that x0 is the unique solution of this equation.\nLemma 3. x0 is a multiple of 2 2 \u22c5 32 \u22c5 7 2 \u22c5 432 .\nProof. We apply our second method.\nBecause \u03c6 (0) = \u03c6 (3) and \u03c6 (1) = \u03c6 (2) we take x0 \u2265 4 .\nIf 2 /| x0 then there is y0 = 2x0 \u2260 x0 such that \u03c6 (y0 ) = \u03c6 (x0 ) , hence 2 | x0 ; if\n4 /| x0 , then we can take y0 = x0 / 2 .\nIf 3 /| x0 then y0 = 3x0 / 2 , hence 3 | x0 ; if 9 /| x0 then y0 = 2x0 / 3 , hence 9 | x0 ;\nwhence 4 \u22c5 9 | x0 .\nIf 7 /| x0 then y0 = 7 x0 / 6 , hence 7 | x0 ; if 49 /| x0 then y0 = 6 x0 / 7 hence 49 | x0 ;\nwhence 4 \u22c5 9 \u22c5 49 | x0 .\nIf 43 /| x0 then y0 = 43x0 / 42 , hence 43 | x0 ; if\n\n432 /| x0 then y0 = 42x0 / 43 ,\n\nhence 432 | x0 ; whence 2 2 \u22c5 32 \u22c5 7 2 \u22c5 432 | x0 .\nThus x0 = 2\u03b3 1 \u22c5 3\u03b3 2 \u22c5 7\u03b3 3 \u22c5 43\u03b3 4 \u22c5 t , with all \u03b3 i \u2265 2 and (t, 2@3@7@43) = 1 and\nx0 > 1010000 because n0 > 1010000 .\n\u00a73. Let's consider m1 \u2265 3. If 5 /| x0 then 5x0 / 4 = y0 , hence 5 | x0 ; if 25 /| x0 then\ny0 = 4x0 / 5 , whence 25 | x0 .\nWe construct the recurrent set M of prime numbers:\na) the elements 2, 3,5 \u2208 M ;\nb) if the distinct odd elements e1 ,..., en \u2208M and bm = 1 + 2 m \u22c5 e1 ,..., en is prime,\nwith m = 1 or m = 2 , then bm \u2208M ;\n\n2\n\n\fc) any element belonging to M is obtained by the utilization (a finite number of\ntimes) of the rules a) or b) only.\nThe author conjectures that M is infinite, which solves this case, because it results\nthat there is an infinite number of primes which divide x0 . This is absurd.\nFor example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 23, 29, 31, 43, 47, 53, 61, ... belong to M .\n\n*\n\nThe method from \u00a73 could be continued as a tree (for \u03b3 2 \u2265 3 afterwards \u03b3 3 \u2265 3 ,\netc.) but its ramifications are very complicated...\n\u00a74. A Property for a Counter-Example to Carmichael Conjecture.\nCarmicha\u00ebl has conjectured that:\n(\u2200) n \u2208 N, (\u2203) m \u2208 N , with m \u2260 n , for which \u03c6 (n) = \u03c6 (m) , where \u03c6 is Euler's totient\nfunction.\nThere are many papers on this subject, but the author cites the papers which have\ninfluenced him, especially Klee's papers.\nLet n be a counterexample to Carmicha\u00ebl's conjecture.\nGrosswald has proved that n0 is a multiple of 32, Donnelly has pushed the result\nto a multiple of 214 , and Klee to a multiple of 2 42 \u22c5 347 , Smarandache has shown that n is\na multiple of 2 2 \u22c5 32 \u22c5 7 2 \u22c5 432 . Masai & Valette have bounded\nn > 1010000.\nIn this paragraph we will extend these results to: n is a multiple of a product of a\nvery large number of primes.\nWe construct a recurrent set M such that:\na) the elements 2, 3 \u2208 M ;\nb) if the distinct elements 2, 3, q1 ,..., qr \u2208 M and p = 1 + 2a \u22c5 3b \u22c5 q1 \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 qr is a prime,\nwhere a \u2208 {0,1, 2,..., 41} and b \u2208 {0,1, 2,..., 46} , then p \u2208 M ; r \u2265 0 ;\n\nc) any element belonging to M is obtained only by the utilization (a finite\nnumber of times) of the rules a) or b).\nOf course, all elements from M are primes.\nLet n be a multiple of 2 42 \u22c5 347 ;\nif 5 /| n then there exists m = 5n/4 ... n such that \u03c6 (n ) = \u03c6 ( m ) ; hence\n5 | n ; whence 5 \u2208 M ;\nif 5 2 /| n then there exists m = 4n/5 ... n with our property; hence 5 2 | n ;\nanalogously, if 7 /| n we can take m = 7 n / 6 \u2260 n , hence 7 | n ; if 7 2 /| n we can\ntake m = 6n / 7 \u2260 n ; whence 7 \u2208 M and 7 2 | n ; etc.\nThe method continues until it isn't possible to add any other prime to M , by its\nconstruction.\nFor example, from the 168 primes smaller than 1000, only 17 of them do not\nbelong to M (namely: 101, 151, 197, 251, 401, 491, 503, 601, 607, 677, 701, 727, 751,\n809, 883, 907, 983); all other 151 primes belong to M .\n\n3\n\n\fNote M = {2,3, p1 , p2 ,..., ps ,...} , then n is a multiple of 2 42 \u22c5 347 \u22c5 p12 \u22c5 p22 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 ps2 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5\nFrom our example, it results that M contains at least 151 elements, hence s \u2265 149 .\nIf M is infinite then there is no counterexample n , whence Carmicha\u00ebl's\nconjecture is solved.\n(The author conjectures M is infinite.)\nUsing a computer it is possible to find a very large number of primes, which\ndivide n , using the construction method of M , and trying to find a new prime p if\np \u2212 1 is a product of primes only from M .\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n\nR.
