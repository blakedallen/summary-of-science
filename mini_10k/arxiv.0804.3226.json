If\nI, I 0 \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , n} with |I| = |I 0 |, we denote the minor of A with row set I\nand column set I 0 as (I|I 0 )(A) := det A(I|I 0 ). If S = ((I1 |I10 ), . . . , (Ip |Ip0 )) is a\nsequence of p row and column sets, we define a function S(A) = det A(I1 |I10 ) *\ndet A(I2 |I20 ) * * * det A(Ip |Ip0 ). Please note that S(A) > 0 for any choice of S\nand for all totally positive matrices A. Similarly, if T = ((J1 |J10 ), . . . , (Jq |Jq0 ))\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail addresses: aboocher@nd.edu (Adam Boocher),\nbfroehle@math.berkeley.edu (Bradley Froehle).\n\nPreprint submitted to Linear Algebra and its Applications\n\n13 October 2007\n\n\fis another sequence of q row and column sets, we say that S \u2264 T (with respect\nto the class of totally positive matrices) if S(A) \u2264 T (A) for all totally positive\nmatrices A. Note that if we take the convention that (\u2205|\u2205)(A) = 1, we are free\nto assume that S and T are both sequences of the same size (i.e., p = q) by\nappending an appropriate number of (\u2205|\u2205) to the shorter sequence.\nIt is also reasonable to ask when the ratio S(A)/T (A) is bounded by some\nk > 0 for all totally positive matrices A. If this is true, we say that the ratio\nS/T is bounded by k. It is clear that S \u2264 T if and only if S/T is bounded by\n1. It has been conjectured that if S/T is bounded (by any number), then it is\nnecessarily bounded by 1 (e.g., see [1]).\nRecently, the problem of classifying all such ratios and inequalities has been\na subject of much interest. Fallat et al. [2] were able to classify a large class\nof ratios of products of principal minors. In particular, they gave necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a ratio of products of two minors to be bounded\nover totally positive matrices. This result was later generalized to the case of\nnon-principal minors by Skandera [3]. In this paper we generalize a necessary\ncondition in [2] to the case of non-principal minors, and our main result is an\nexplicit factorization of ratios of the form\ndet A(I1 |I10 ) det A(I2 |I20 )\ndet A(J1 |J10 ) det A(J2 |J20 )\ninto products of elementary ratios. This in particular implies the result of\nSkandera describing bounded ratios of this form. It has been conjectured by\nGekhtman that all bounded ratios are products of these elementary ratios [2].\n\n1.1\n\nPlanar Networks and Totally Positive Matrices\n\nThe relationship between totally positive matrices and directed acyclic weighted\nplanar networks is well studied. It was first discussed by Karlin and McGregor\nin 1959 [4]. For a more modern presentation, refer to the paper by Fomin and\nZelevinsky [5]. In an attempt to keep the manuscript mostly self-contained,\nwe will present some relevant results from these papers.\nA typical directed acyclic weighted planar network is shown in Figure 1. Note\nthat because the graph is acyclic, we can stretch the network in an appropriate\nfashion so that the direction of each edge is oriented from left-to-right. Furthermore, the network is assumed to have n labeled sources (on the left) and\nn labeled sinks (on the right). Both sources and sinks are labeled bottom to\ntop. Additionally, to each edge of the network we associate a positive weight.\nIn Figure 1, these weights are shown as li , dj , or uk . Unmarked weights are\nassumed to be 1.\n2\n\n\fdn\n\nn\nln\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\nun\u22121\n\ndn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\n3\n\n3\nlk\u22121\n\n2\n1\n\nlk\n\nlk\u22122\n\nln+1\n\nl2\nln\n\nu2\n\nd2\nl1\n\nu1\n\nd1\n\nun+1\nun\n\nuk\u22121\nuk\u22122\n\nuk\n\n2\n1\n\nFig. 1. General Planar Network\n\nLet \u03c0 be any path running left-to-right from source i to sink j. We define the\nweight of this path to be the product of the weights along each edge of the\npath and denote this as w(\u03c0).\nTo each such diagram, we can associate a totally positive matrix A with entries\naij given by\naij =\n\nX\n\nw(\u03c0)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c0:i\u2192j\n\nwhere the summation is over all paths \u03c0 that begin at source i and end at\nsink j. Formula (1) establishes a bijection between totally positive matrices\nand planar networks of the kind depicted in Figure 1. This fact is equivalent\nto Anne Whitney's Reduction Theorem [6].\nLet us define a path family \u03c0 as a set of non-intersecting paths running from\nleft-to-right starting at the sources in I and terminating at the sinks in I 0 . The\nweight of such a path family w(\u03c0) is defined to be the product of the weights\nof each path in the path family. As shown in [7] the minor with row set I and\ncolumn set I 0 is\ndet A(I|I 0 ) =\n\nX\n\nw(\u03c0)\n\n\u03c0:I\u2192I 0\n\nwhere the summation is over all such possible path families from I to I 0 .\nGiven the row set I and column set I 0 , we have found it helpful to follow\nSkandera [3] in defining the set I 00 which encapsulates both I and I 0\nI 00 = I \u222a {2n + 1 \u2212 i | i \u2208 I 0c }\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I 0c = {1, 2, . . . , n} \\ I 0 . While this I 00 may seem cryptic, it has a natural\ninterpretation if one considers an embedding of totally positive matrices into\nthe totally positive part of the Grassmannian Gr(n, 2n).\n3\n\n\f1.2\n\nGrassmannians\n\nIn this section we will discuss the real Grassmannian and refer the reader to\nSection 5.4 of [8] for more information. Recall that the real Grassmannian\nGr(n, 2n) is the set of n-dimensional subspaces of R2n , i.e.\nGr(n, 2n) = {Real 2n \u00d7 n matrices of rank n}/GL(n, R)\nwhere we have factored out the action of right multiplication by an invertible\nn \u00d7 n matrix.\nIt is clear that an element \u039b \u2208 Gr(n, 2n) does not have a unique matrix\nrepresentation, but rather a collection of matrix representatives which are\nunique up to right multiplication by an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix.\nIf A is a 2n\u00d7n matrix representative of \u039b, we can define the Pl\u00fccker coordinates\nof \u039b with respect to A (or more briefly the Pl\u00fccker coordinates of A)\n\u0010 to\n\u0011 be the\n2n\nvector of all n \u00d7 n minors of the matrix A, i.e. an element of real n -space.\nWe say an element \u039b \u2208 Gr(n, 2n) is totally positive if there exists a matrix\nrepresentative A of \u039b such that every Pl\u00fccker coordinate of A is positive. The\ntotally positive part of the Grassmannian Gr(n, 2n) is then defined to be\nT P Gr(n, 2n) = {\u039b \u2208 Gr(n, 2n) : \u039b is totally positive}.\nIf \u039b \u2208 T P Gr(n, 2n) we say that the standard matrix representative of \u039b is the\n2n \u00d7 n matrix representative \u0100 with lower n \u00d7 n submatrix equal to\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n..\n\n.\n\n\u00b11\n\n\u22121 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nNote that such a matrix can always be chosen because the lower n \u00d7 n block\nof any matrix representative of \u039b is always of full rank.\nProposition 1 There is a natural bijection:\n{Totally positive n \u00d7 n matrices} \u2194 T P Gr(n, 2n).\nPROOF. Let \u039b \u2208 T P Gr(n, 2n), and let \u0100 be its standard matrix representative. We shall denote the upper n \u00d7 n submatrix of \u0100 as A. Then the\n4\n\n\frelation\ndet A(I|I 0 ) = det \u0100(I 00 |(1, 2, . . . , n))\n\nwhere I 00 is defined as in equation 2, and the positivity of all Pl\u00fccker coordinates of \u0100 imply that A is a totally positive matrix.\nThis same relation allows us to pass from an n \u00d7 n totally positive matrix A\nto an element \u039b \u2208 T P Gr(n, 2n) by choosing \u039b to be the unique element with\nstandard matrix representative having A as the upper n \u00d7 n submatrix.\nWith this bijection clearly established we will maintain the convention of using\nA to represent a totally positive n \u00d7 n matrix and \u0100 as its corresponding\nstandard matrix representative in T P Gr(n, 2n).\nFor additional notational convenience, and to distinguish between minors and\nPl\u00fccker coordinates, we will designate index sets representing Pl\u00fccker coordinates using Greek letters and drop the bar notation where its meaning is\nunambiguous. That is, for an index set \u03b1j \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , 2n} of size n, we define\n[\u03b1j ](A) := det \u0100(\u03b1j |(1, 2, . . . , n)).\n\n(3)\n\nUnless stated otherwise, all index sets \u03b1j in the remainder of the paper will\nbe assumed to be cardinality n subsets of {1, . . . , 2n}.\nIf we have a sequence of index sets \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1p ), we can define the\nfunction \u03b1(A) as a product of Pl\u00fccker coordinates\n\u03b1(A) =\n\np\nY\n\n[\u03b1i ](A)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere A is an n \u00d7 n totally positive matrix.\nIf we similarly let \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2q ) be another sequence of index sets, we write\n\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 (with respect to totally positive matrices) if \u03b1(A) \u2264 \u03b2(A) for all n \u00d7 n\ntotally positive matrices A. We say that \u03b1/\u03b2 is bounded by k (with respect\nto totally positive matrices) if \u03b1(A)/\u03b2(A) \u2264 k for all totally positive matrices\nA. Note that \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 is equivalent to saying \u03b1/\u03b2 is bounded by 1.\nBy construction we have [(n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n)](A) = 1 for all totally positive\nmatrices A, and thus in general we will assume that \u03b1 and \u03b2 each contain the\nsame number of index sets.\nLastly, when we say\n[\u03b11 ] * * * [\u03b1p ]\n[\u03b21 ] * * * [\u03b2p ]\n5\n\n\fis bounded (resp. bounded by k), we mean that the ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 is bounded\n(resp. bounded by k) where \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1p ) and \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2p ).\n\n2\n\nOperations Which Preserve Bounded Ratios\n\nBefore proving the main theorem in the work of Fallat et al. (see [2]), they\ndeveloped several operators that preserved bounded ratios of minors, namely\nwhat they called the Complement, Reversal, Shift, Insertion, and Deletion\noperators. Of these operators, we will provide generalizations of the shift and\nreversal operators. The insertion and deletion operators were not generalized\nbecause they have little applicability to our situation in which the cardinality\nof each index set must remain fixed. The complement operator was not studied.\nDefinition 2 (Cyclic Shift) For an index set \u03b1j , define a cyclic shift of the\nelements of \u03b1j as\n\u03c3(\u03b1j ) = {i + 1 mod 2n | i \u2208 \u03b1j }\nwhich maps i \u2208 \u03b1j to i + 1 and 2n back to 1.\n\nFor a sequence \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1p ) of index sets, define \u03c3(\u03b1) = (\u03c3(\u03b11 ), . . . , \u03c3(\u03b1p )).\nLemma 3 Let A be a n \u00d7 n totally positive matrix.

(We can think of \u0100 as the\nembedding of A = diag(t, 1, 1, . . . , 1) \u00d7 C into T P Gr(n, 2n)).\nLet \u03b1j be any index set. Then either:\n\u2022 1 \u2208 \u03b1j and [\u03b1j ](A) = ci t for some positive constant ci ; or\n\u2022 1\u2208\n6 \u03b1j and [\u03b1j ](A) = ci for some positive constant ci .\nThus \u03b1(A) is a monomial in t of degree f\u03b1 (1) and \u03b2(A) is a monomial in t of\ndegree f\u03b2 (1). Because we have assumed that f\u03b1 (1) 6= f\u03b2 (1), \u03b1(A)/\u03b2(A) must\nincrease without bound as either t \u2192 0 or t \u2192 \u221e so the ratio is not bounded.\nIn order to present another necessary condition for a ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 to be bounded,\nwe first need to discuss the concept of majorization. The following two definitions and one proposition can be found in [9].\nDefinition 8 (Majorization) Let x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) be\ntwo non-increasing sequences of non-negative integers.

Then x \u0017 y if and only if y \u2217 \u0017 x\u2217 .\nThe following notion of an interval is relied upon in the work of Fallat, Skandera, and others (see [2,3]). Note that we define an interval slightly differently\n8\n\n\fas contiguous points on a labeled 2n-gon rather than contiguous points on a\nline segment with 2n vertices, but Lemma 3 shows us that such a distinction\nis irrelevant in most cases.\nDefinition 11 (Interval) A subset L \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , 2n} is called an interval if\neither L or Lc = {1, 2, . . . , 2n} \\ L has the form {i, i + 1, i + 2, . . . , i + m}.\nUnless mentioned otherwise, all intervals L will be assumed to be subsets of\n{1, . . . , 2n} of the specified form.\nThe following definition comes directly from the work of Fallat et al. but is\napplied to the case of non-principal minors (see [2, \u00a72]).\nDefinition 12 (Condition (M)) Let \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1p ) and \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2p )\nbe two sequences of index sets. For any subset L of {1, . . . , 2n}, define m(\u03b1, L)\nto be the non-increasing rearrangement of the sequence (|\u03b11 \u2229 L|, . . . , |\u03b1p \u2229 L|).\nWe say that a ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 satisfies condition (M) if\nm(\u03b1, L) \u0017 m(\u03b2, L)\nfor every interval L.\nRemark 13 Condition (M) implies the ST0 condition by choosing the interval L = {j} for j = 1, . . . , 2n.\nBefore we show that condition (M) is necessary for a ratio \u03b1/\u03b2 to be bounded,\nwe give some lemmas which will aid in the proof.\nLemma 14 Let \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1p ) and \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2p ) be two sequences\nof index sets and L be any interval. If m(\u03b1, L) \u0017 m(\u03b2, L) then m(\u03b1, Lc ) \u0017\nm(\u03b2, Lc ).\n\nPROOF. Denote the components of m(\u03b1, L), etc. by\n\nm(\u03b1, L) = (m1 , . . . , mp ),\nm(\u03b2, L) = (m01 , . . . , m0p ),\nm(\u03b1, Lc ) = (np , . . . , n1 ),\nm(\u03b2, Lc ) = (n0p , . . . , n01 ).\n\nSince |\u03b1j \u2229 L| + |\u03b1j \u2229 Lc | = n, we have mi + ni = m0i + n0i = n for all i. Let\nP\nP\nM = pi=1 mi = pi=1 m0i .

In particular, ratios belonging to\neither of these classes will be bounded by 1.\nLet \u03b1i be an index set. If \u03b1i = \u03b31 \u222a* * *\u222a\u03b3n then the notation [\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n ] should\nbe interpreted as [\u03b1i ]. Furthermore, if \u03b3i consists of only a single element j,\nthen we may simply write j instead of \u03b3i .\nDefinition 16 An elementary ratio is a ratio of the form\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\nsatisfying\n11\n\n\f(1) |\u2206| = n \u2212 2;\n(2) i < i0 < j < j 0 when considering each element as the mod 2n representative in {i, i + 1, . . . , i + 2n \u2212 1}; and\n(3) i, i0 , j, and j 0 are not elements of \u2206.\nProposition 17 A ratio R of the form\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\nwith |\u2206| = n \u2212 2, \u2206 \u2229 {i, i0 , j, j 0 } = \u2205 and i, i0 , j, j 0 pairwise distinct is\nelementary if and only if it satisfies condition (M).\n\nPROOF. Suppose the ratio R is elementary, and let L be any interval. Set\n\u03b11 = {i, j 0 } \u222a \u2206, \u03b12 = {i0 , j} \u222a \u2206, \u03b21 = {i, j} \u222a \u2206, and \u03b22 = {i0 , j 0 } \u222a \u2206, so\nthat R = [\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]/[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ].\nBecause R satisfies the ST0 condition by construction, it suffices to verify that\nmax (|\u03b11 \u2229 L|, |\u03b12 \u2229 L|) \u2265 max (\u03b21 \u2229 L|, |\u03b22 \u2229 L|)\nor equivalently\nmax (|{i, j 0 } \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j} \u2229 L|) \u2265 max ({i, j} \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j 0 } \u2229 L|)\nnoting that |\u2206 \u2229 L| appears in every term and thus may be omitted. We verify\nthis last inequality by considering the possible values for the right hand side.\nIf the right hand side is 0, the inequality is trivially satisfied.\nIf the right hand side is 1, the interval L contains at least one of i, i0 , j, or j 0\nand thus the left hand side is at least 1.\nIf the right hand side is 2, the interval L contains either i and j, or i0 and j 0 .\nAssume for the moment that L contains both i and j. Then because R is an\nelementary ratio it must be that the interval L also contains either i0 or j 0 (or\npossibly both), and hence the left hand side is 2. Similar reasoning holds if L\nhad instead contained i0 and j 0 .\nConversely, suppose that the ratio R satisfies condition (M). Consider the two\nintervals L = {i, i + 1, . . . , j} and L0 = {j, j + 1, . . . , i}, working with the\nelements modulo 2n as required. Because R satisfies condition (M), it must\nbe that\nmax (|{i, j 0 } \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j} \u2229 L|) \u2265 max ({i, j} \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j 0 } \u2229 L|) = 2\n12\n\n\fand hence either i0 or j 0 lies in L. Additionally, upon consideration of the\ncomplementary interval L0 , we see that\nmax (|{i, j 0 } \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j} \u2229 L|) \u2265 max ({i, j} \u2229 L|, |{i0 , j 0 } \u2229 L|) = 2\nand hence either i0 or j 0 lies in L0 . Thus working modulo 2n and considering\nrepresentatives in {i, i + 1, . . . , i + 2n \u2212 1}, we have either i < i0 < j < j 0\nor i < j 0 < j < i0 . In the first case the ratio is elementary. In the latter\ncase, a simple renaming i \u2194 j 0 and i0 \u2194 j preserves the ratio and makes it\nelementary.\nRemark 18 All elementary ratios are necessarily bounded by 1. Indeed, the\nshort Pl\u00fccker relation\n[i, i0 , \u2206][j, j 0 , \u2206] + [i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206] = [i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\n\n(4)\n\ntogether with the positivity of all Pl\u00fccker coordinates over T P Gr(n, 2n) imply\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206] < [i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\nas desired.\nComputationally the elementary ratios are inefficient due to the large number\nof them. The solution to this problem is to consider instead a small subset of\nthe elementary ratios, which we will call the basic ratios. We will show that\nevery elementary ratio can be written as a product of positive powers of basic\nratios. We will use this fact in the next section.\nDefinition 19 A basic ratio is one of the form\n[i, j + 1, \u2206][i + 1, j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i + 1, j + 1, \u2206]\nwhere i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , 2n} and \u2206 \u2282 {1, . . . , 2n} such that |\u2206| = n \u2212 2 and i,\ni+1, j, j +1 and \u2206 are all distinct. Here indices i+1 and j +1 are understood\nmod 2n.\nClearly, a basic ratio is an elementary ratio with i0 = i + 1, and j 0 = j + 1.\nWe define the complexity of a particular elementary ratio\nR=\n\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\n\nas\n\u03bc(R) = |\u2206 \u2229 ({i, i + 1, . . . , i0 } \u222a {j, j + 1, . . . , j 0 })| .\nTo prove that every elementary ratio can be written as a product of basic\nratios, we first consider the following special case.\n13\n\n\fLemma 20 An elementary ratio R with complexity \u03bc(R) = 0 can be written\nas a product of basic ratios.\nPROOF. We define\n\u03b4(R) = |{i, i + 1, . . . , i0 } \u222a {j, j + 1, . . . , j 0 }| .\nRecall that R is a basic ratio if i0 = i + 1 and j 0 = j + 1, or in other words\n\u03b4(R) = 4. We proceed by induction.\nAssume that when \u03bc(R) = 0 and \u03b4(R) = 4, 5, . . . , k \u22121 we have a factorization\nof ratio R into a product of basic ratios.\nNow consider a given elementary ratio R with \u03bc(R) = 0 and \u03b4(R) = k > 4. It\ncannot be the case that both i0 = i + 1 and j 0 = j + 1 as \u03b4(R) > 4. Without\nloss of generality, assume that i + 1 6= i0 (otherwise exchange the labels of i\nand i0 with j and j 0 respectively).\nNow the elementary ratio R factors as\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n=\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\n\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i + 1, j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i + 1, j 0 , \u2206]\n\n!\n\n[i + 1, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n[i + 1, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\n\n!\n\nwhere each factor F on the right hand size has \u03bc(F ) = 0 and \u03b4(F ) < k. By\ninduction, each factor on the right hand side can be expressed as a product of\nbasic ratios. Hence R can we written as a product of basic ratios.\nTheorem 21 Every elementary ratio can be written as a product of basic\nratios.\nPROOF. We shall proceed by induction on \u03bc(R). By the previous lemma,\nwhen \u03bc(R) = 0 we have that R can be expressed as a product of basic ratios.\nAssume that for any ratio R with \u03bc(R) = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 we can express R as\na product of basic ratios.\nNow consider an elementary ratio R with \u03bc(R) = k > 0. It cannot be the case\nthat both \u2206 \u2229 {i, i + 1, . . . , i0 } = \u2205 and \u2206 \u2229 {j, j + 1, . . . , j 0 } = \u2205, so assume\nwithout loss of generality that \u2206 \u2229 {i, i + 1, . . . , i0 } 6= \u2205 (if not, exchange the\nlabels of i and i0 with j and j 0 respectively).\nLet p \u2208 \u2206 \u2229 {i, i + 1, . . . , i0 } be the element nearest to i and let \u22060 = \u2206 \\ {p}.\nThe ratio R then factors as\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n=\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\n\n[i, j 0 , p, \u22060 ][i, i0 , j, \u22060 ]\n[i, j, p, \u22060 ][i, i0 , j 0 , \u22060 ]\n14\n\n!\n\n[i, i0 , j 0 , \u22060 ][i0 , j, p, \u22060 ]\n[i, i0 , j, \u22060 ][i0 , j 0 , p, \u22060 ]\n\n!\n\n\fwhere each factor F on the right hand side has \u03bc(F ) < k and hence may be\nwritten as a product of basic ratios.\n\n5\n\nA Factorization of (Some) Bounded Ratios\n\nIn this section we give an alternative proof of a necessary and sufficient condition for a ratio of the form\n[\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]\n(5)\n[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ]\nto be bounded in terms of the four index sets, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b21 , and \u03b22 . In addition,\nwe will show that this ratio can be written as a product of elementary ratios.\nFor the remainder of the section we will assume that R is a ratio of the form\n[\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]/[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ] which satisfies the ST0 condition and condition (M). Denote\nthe set of all such ratios by B. We define\n\u2206 = \u03b11 \u2229 \u03b12 = \u03b21 \u2229 \u03b22 ;\n\u03b31 = (\u03b11 \u2229 \u03b21 ) \\ \u2206;\n\u03b32 = (\u03b11 \u2229 \u03b22 ) \\ \u2206;\n\u03b41 = (\u03b12 \u2229 \u03b22 ) \\ \u2206;\n\u03b42 = (\u03b12 \u2229 \u03b21 ) \\ \u2206; and\n\u03a9 = \u03b31 \u222a \u03b32 \u222a \u03b41 \u222a \u03b42 ,\nso that\n\n[\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u2206]\n[\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]\n=\n.\n[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ]\n[\u03b31 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b32 , \u2206]\n(Recall that notationally [\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u2206] means [\u03b31 \u222a\u03b32 \u222a\u2206], and that we necessarily\nhave: |\u03b31 | = |\u03b41 |; |\u03b32 | = |\u03b42 |; and |\u03b31 | + |\u03b32 | + |\u2206| = n.)\nR =\n\nAn important property of the ratio R is the number of indices which are not\nshared by all index sets comprising the ratio. We shall denote this quantity as\n\u03bd(R) = n \u2212 |\u2206| = |\u03a9|/2.\nBefore proceeding, we investigate what information \u03bd(R) holds.\nDefinition 22 (Trivial Ratio) We say a ratio [\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]/[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ] is trivial if\neither\n\u2022 \u03b11 = \u03b21 and \u03b12 = \u03b22 ; or\n\u2022 \u03b11 = \u03b22 and \u03b12 = \u03b21 .\nNote that a ratio R satisfying the ST0 condition with \u03bd(R) = 0 or 1 is trivial.\n15\n\n\fLemma 23 Suppose R \u2208 B and \u03bd(R) = 2. Then either\n\u2022 R is trivial; or\n\u2022 R is an elementary ratio and can be written as a product of basic ratios.\n\nPROOF. If R is not trivial, R must be of the form\n[i, j 0 , \u2206][i0 , j, \u2206]\n[i, j, \u2206][i0 , j 0 , \u2206]\nwith |\u2206| = n \u2212 2 and i, i0 , j, j 0 , and \u2206 pairwise distinct. Proposition 17\nestablishes that R is an elementary ratio, and hence R may be written as a\nproduct of basic ratios by Theorem 21.\n\nWe will eventually show that any ratio R \u2208 B with \u03bd(R) \u2265 3 can be factored\nas R = R1 R2 with Ri \u2208 B and \u03bd(Ri ) < \u03bd(R) for i = 1, 2. In order to do this,\nwe will rely heavily upon the following definition, simple remark, and technical\nlemma.\nDefinition 24 (Interlacing) Suppose (i1 , i2 , . . . , ik ) and (j1 , j2 , . . . , jk ) are\ntwo subsequences of (1, 2, . . . , 2n). Then we say the sequence (is ) interlaces\nthe sequence (jt ) if either:\n(1) j1 \u2264 i1 \u2264 j2 \u2264 i2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 jk \u2264 ik ; or\n(2) i1 \u2264 j1 \u2264 i2 \u2264 j2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 ik \u2264 jk .\nRemark 25 Suppose the ratio R = [\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]/[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ] satisfies the ST0 condition, and suppose that \u03b21 \\ \u2206 interlaces with \u03b22 \\ \u2206. Then R automatically\nsatisfies condition (M).\nFor notational convenience, let g(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , L) = max(|\u03b11 \u2229 L|, |\u03b12 \u2229 L|).\nLemma 26 (Technical Lemma) Suppose that R \u2208 B and we have a factorization of R as\n[\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b42 , \u2206] [\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u2206]\n[\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u2206]\n=\n*\n[\u03b31 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b32 , \u2206]\n[\u03b31 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b32 , \u2206] [\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b32 , \u2206]\nfor some non-empty sets \u03b311 , \u03b312 , \u03b411 , and \u03b412 where \u03b31 = \u03b311 \u222a \u03b312 and \u03b41 =\n\u03b411 \u222a \u03b412 such that |\u03b311 | = |\u03b411 | and |\u03b312 | = |\u03b412 |.\nSuppose as well that \u03b311 \u222a \u03b412 interlaces with \u03b312 \u222a \u03b411 .\n16\n\n\fThen each of the factors\nR1 =\n\n[\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b42 , \u2206]\n[\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b32 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b42 , \u2206]\nand R2 =\n,\n[\u03b31 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b32 , \u2206]\n[\u03b311 , \u03b412 , \u03b42 , \u2206][\u03b41 , \u03b32 , \u2206]\n\nare elements of B, and \u03bd(Ri ) < \u03bd(R) for i = 1, 2.\nPROOF.

This, along with the hypothesis that \u03b311 \u222a \u03b412 interlaces\nwith \u03b312 \u222a \u03b411 , immediately gives\ng(\u03b31 , \u03b41 , L) \u2265 g(\u03b311 \u222a \u03b412 , \u03b312 \u222a \u03b411 , L)\nfor all intervals L.\nFix an interval L.

Then since g(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , L) \u2265 g(\u03b21 , \u03b22 , L) it follows that\n|\u03b31 \u2229 L| \u2265 |\u03b41 \u2229 L| and |\u03b32 \u2229 L| \u2265 |\u03b42 \u2229 L|.

Without loss of generality, assume that \u03b31 and \u03b41 do not interlace.\n(If instead \u03b32 and \u03b42 do not interlace, interchange the labeling of \u03b11 and \u03b12 ).\nLabel the elements of \u03b31 \u222a \u03b41 as {i1 , i2 , . . . , i2m } with i1 < i2 < * * * < i2m ,\nand define \u03b311 = \u03b31 \u2229 {i1 , i3 , . . . , i2m\u22121 }, \u03b312 = \u03b31 \u2229 {i2 , i4 , . . . , i2m }, \u03b412 =\n\u03b41 \u2229 {i1 , i3 , . . . , i2m\u22121 }, and \u03b411 = \u03b41 \u2229 {i2 , i4 , . . . , i2m }.\nBecause \u03b31 does not interlace with \u03b41 , we have constructed \u03b311 , \u03b312 , \u03b411 , and\n\u03b412 to all be non-empty. In addition, \u03b311 \u222a \u03b412 interlaces with \u03b312 \u222a \u03b411 , thus\nsatisfying the requirements of Lemma 26.\n\nWe now examine the situation when both \u03b31 interlaces with \u03b41 and \u03b32 interlaces\nwith \u03b42 .\nClaim 28 (Agreeable Labeling) Let R \u2208 B be a ratio satisfying condition\n(M), and suppose that \u03b31 interlaces with \u03b41 and \u03b32 interlaces with \u03b42 .

It cannot be that this pair lies entirely in one of \u03b31 , \u03b32 ,\n\u03b41 , or \u03b42 , as this would violate the interlacing hypotheses. However if il and\nil+1 lie in different sets, for example \u03b31 and \u03b42 , consideration of condition (M)\nwith the interval L = {il , . . . , il+1 } again leads to a contradiction.\nThus \u03b31 \u222a \u03b42 and \u03b41 \u222a \u03b32 contain no consecutive pairs of elements of \u03a9, and\nhence we may assume (up to relabeling of \u03b21 and \u03b22 ) that both (1) and (2)\nhold.

If either \u03b31 and \u03b41 do not interlace, or \u03b32 and \u03b42 do not interlace,\nor both we may appeal to Lemma 27.\n22\n\n\fIf instead both \u03b31 interlaces with \u03b41 and \u03b32 interlaces with \u03b42 , we may assume\nwithout loss of generality that R is agreeably labeled (see Claim 28). Observe\nthat with this labeling i2 \u2208 \u03b41 \u222a \u03b32 .\nIf i2 \u2208 \u03b41 , we may appeal to Lemma 29.\nIf i2 \u2208 \u03b32 , we may appeal to Lemma 30.\nWe now state our main result.\nTheorem 32 (Main Theorem) Let R be a ratio of the form \u03b1/\u03b2 = [\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ]/[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ]\nwhere \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 are index sets in {1, . . . , 2n}.

Note that (2) =\u21d2 (3) =\u21d2 (4) =\u21d2 (1) are clear, so what\nremains to show is that (1) =\u21d2 (2).\nBy Theorem 31, we may write any ratio R of the specified form satisfying condition (M) with \u03bd(R) \u2265 3 as a product of ratios R1 R2 of the same form where\neach satisfies condition (M) and \u03bd(Ri ) < \u03bd(R) for i = 1, 2. By Lemma 23 and\nthe remarks directly preceding it, any ratio R of the specified form satisfying\ncondition (M) with \u03bd(R) \u2264 2 is either trivial or can be written as a product\nof basic ratios.\nA simple induction argument on the value of \u03bd(R) completes the proof.\nRemark 33 Much of the proof in this section extends similar techniques used\nby Fallat et al. to the case of non-principal minors (see [2]). The equivalence\nof (1), (3) and (4) in Theorem 32 is a result of Skandera (see [3]).\nRemark 34 While we have shown that condition (M) implies boundedness\nfor this specific class of ratios, this condition is not sufficient in general.

Recall there are N = 2n\nsuch index sets. Then each ratio can be\nn\ndescribed by giving the power to which each index set appears in the ratio;\nterms appearing in the denominator have negative exponent. This allows us to\nidentify each ratio with a vector in RN where each entry represents the power\nto which that index set appears in the ratio. The product of two ratios then\nsimply corresponds to the sum of their two associated vectors in RN .\nWe write v1 , . . . , vM as the vectors that correspond to each of the\n!\n\n2n \u2212 4\nM = n(2n \u2212 3)\nn\u22122\n\nbasic ratios. Such a list of generating vectors can be easily computed using\nMathematica.\n24\n\n\fThe set of all ratios that are products of positive powers of the basic ratios is\na polyhedral cone\nP ={\n\nM\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi vi , \u03bbi \u2208 R\u22650 }.\n\nP can also be described as the intersection of finitely many linear half-spaces,\nnamely\nP = {x \u2208 RN | A * x \u2264 0}\n\nfor some matrix A that can be computed. The software program cdd+ [10] is\nuseful in the conversion between these two representations of convex polyhedral cones.\nWe illustrate the utility of this by proving a non-trivial theorem. This result\nwas first obtained in [1].\nProposition 36 Every bounded ratio of minors of a 3 \u00d7 3 totally positive\nmatrix can be written as a product of positive powers of the basic ratios. Furthermore, every such bounded ratio is bounded by 1.\nThis can be verified computationally by computing the half planes of the cone\ngenerated by the basic ratios and then constructing a matrix in terms of a\nparameter t that satisfies the inequality listed above.\nAs mentioned in [2], one method of determining whether or not a ratio is\nbounded is to work with a totally positive matrix corresponding to the diagram\nin Figure 1. The entries in this matrix are then polynomials in the variables\nli , dj , and uk . It is well known that this matrix will be totally positive if\neach variable is chosen to be positive, and all totally positive matrices may be\narrived at by this construction for appropriate choices of the variables.\n\nIn this view, a ratio of minors R is a rational function p/q in the same variables. Some information about the ratio p/q may be gleaned by examining\nthe difference q \u2212 p as a polynomial in the variables li , dj , and uk . We denote\nthis polynomial by pR . For example, if every coefficient in pR is positive (we\ncall this 'subtraction free') then pR will be positive for any choice of positive\nvariables li , dj , and uk . This would imply that the ratio p/q is necessarily\nbounded by 1 over the class of totally positive matrices.\nThis suggests the following conjecture, formulated in [2,3]\nConjecture 37 A ratio of minors R is bounded if and only if pR is subtraction\nfree.\nIn other words, if pR is not subtraction free, we conjecture that it is possible to find a family of totally positive matrices on which the ratio increases\nwithout bound. (It has always been possible in every ratio that we have ex25\n\n\famined.) This is significant, because of the existence of polynomials which\nremain nonnegative but are not subtraction free. (e.g. x2 + y 2 \u2212 2xy + 1).\nRemark 38 Observe that Conjecture 37 follows from Conjecture 35 and the\nshort Pl\u00fccker relation (Equation 4). Indeed, the short Pl\u00fccker relation guarantees that all basic ratios are subtraction free. This fact extends to arbitrary\nproducts of basic ratios, noting that if R = A/B * C/D where both pA/B and\npC/D are subtraction free, then pR = BD \u2212 AC = D(B \u2212 A) + A(D \u2212 C) is\nalso subtraction free.\nUsing Mathematica, we considered the set of ratios of the form\n[\u03b11 ][\u03b12 ][\u03b13 ]\n[\u03b21 ][\u03b22 ][\u03b23 ]\n\n(7)\n\nover the class of 4 \u00d7 4 totally positive matrices.\nOf the ratios satisfying the required ST0 and majorization conditions, we\nfound that approximately 98% could be written as a product of basic ratios.\nThose that could not be written as a product of basic ratios were found to be\nnot subtraction free and actually unbounded over the class of totally positive\nmatrices. The results of these computer experiments can be summarized in\nthe following proposition.\nProposition 39 For ratios of the form in Equation 7, the following are equivalent when working over 4 \u00d7 4 totally positive matrices:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe\nThe\nThe\nThe\n\nratio\nratio\nratio\nratio\n\nis bounded;\nis bounded by 1;\ncan be factored into a product of basic ratios; and\nis subtraction free.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank their advisors, Misha Gekhtman and Frank\nConnolly for the countless hours of help they provided.
