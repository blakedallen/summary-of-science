The need for a fast and reliable statetransfer in quantum omputers and quantum networks is\nposing questions on erning the pra ti al and prin iple\nlimitations on the speed and reliability of su h a ommuni ation form (in addition to the obvious limitations related to the speed of light). These questions were onsidered mainly [3\u2104-[6\u2104, though not only [7\u2104-[10\u2104, in ondensed\nmatter systems where the transferred states belong to a\n\u001cnite dimensional Hilbert spa e (e.g. that of 2 or 3 level\nsystems and unlike the state of a harmoni os illator).\nHere we onsider a state transfer between two identi al harmoni os illators oupled to opposite ends of a\ntransmission line. We show that by performing a single\noperation of properly hosen time-dependent swit hing of\nthe oupling (denoted by \u03b3(t)) between one of the os illators and the transmission line, a state transfer is a hieved\nwith an arbitrary high \u001cdelity whi h is independent of the\ninitial states of the two os illators.\nWe start by analyzing the ase where a single os illator (labeled i) is oupled to a transmission line with a\nonstant oupling, \u03b3i . Assuming that \u03b3i (whi h also hara terizes the damping of the os illator) is mu h smaller\nthan the os illator frequen y \u03c90 , one is allowed to use\nthe slowly varying envelope, Markov, and rotating-wave\napproximations. In a frame rotating at the os illator\nfrequen y, the Heisenberg equations of motion are then\ngiven by (see, e.g., Eqs. (7.15) and (7.18) in Ref. [12\u2104):\nand\n\np\ndai\n+ \u03b3i ai = 2\u03b3i bi,in (t),\ndt\n\ni = 1, 2\n\np\n2\u03b3i ai = bi,in (t) + bi,out (t).\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nai (t) annihilates a mode of the os illator i and satis\u001ces\n[ai (t), a\u2020i (t)] = 1. bi,in/out (t) is an operator related to the\n\nin oming/outgoing \u001celds in the transmission line by [11\u2104\n1\nbi,\u03b1 (t) = \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03c9bi,\u03b1 (\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03b1 = in, out\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere bi,\u03b1 (\u03c9) annihilates a transmission line mode propagating towards (for \u03b1 = in) or away from (for \u03b1 = out)\nthe os illator i, and\n[bi,\u03b1 (t), bi,\u03b1 (t\u2032 )] = 0.

(1) and the driving term on the left. Eq. (2) is a\nboundary ondition mat hing the value of the os illator\n\u001celd with that of the transmission line at their interfa e.\nEqs. (1) and (2) provide a rather general des ription of\na weakly-damped harmoni os illator (a avity resonator\nor an LC ir uit) oupled to a ontinuum of propagating\nharmoni modes su h as those of free spa e or a waveguide su h as an opti al \u001cber or an ele tri al transmission\nline. Spe i\u001c examples of ir uit implementations leading\nto Eqs. (1) and (2) are dis ussed below.

(5)\n0\n\nNow we pro eed to analyze two os illators oupled to\nboth ends of a transmission line. We onsider the os illators to be ' as aded' i.e. the modes propagating away\nfrom os illator 1 are propagating into os illator 2 while\nthe modes propagating away from os illator 2 are dire ted into a termination whi h fun tions as a bla k-body\nabsorber (preventing ba kward s attering of the modes)\nat a temperature of absolute zero. This an be a hieved\nby employing an isolator, su h as the terminated three\nport ir ulator shown in Fig. 1, in the transmission line.\nDenoting the propagation time of the signal along the\nline by \u03c4, one therefore has b1,out (t) = b2,in (t + \u03c4 ). In\norder to express our results in a form independent of the\n\n\f2\ntransmission line length we shift the time origin of os illator 2 by \u03c4 and thus write\n(6)\n\nb1,out (t) = b2,in (t).\n\nThe equations of motion are thus given by Eq.

This\nadvantage over the standard state-dependent de\u001cnition of\n\u001cdelity [13\u2104 (as an overlap between the \u001cnal state and the\ndesired transferred one) is made possible by the linearity\nof the operator relation, Eq.(7).\nIf a time-dependent swit h is inserted between os illator 1 and the line, the system is still governed by Eqs.\n(1), (2) and (6), ex ept that \u03b31 (t) is now time-dependent\nwhile \u03b32 = \u03b3 remains onstant.

(14) and (16) (with its generalization Eq.(21)) are\nour main results. They demonstrate that a state-transfer\nwith arbitrary good \u001cdelity an be a hieved between two\nidenti al os illators, and that, with the proper hoi e of\nthe swit hing fun tion Eq. (14), the \u001cdelity approa hes\nunity exponentially fast and therefore does not require\nthe operation time to be mu h longer than the damping\ntime. For example, Eq. (16) implies that \u03b3T > 5 su\u001e es\nto a hieve a \u001cdelity greater than 1 \u2212 10\u22124 .\nThe above results relied on the small damping assumption, while \u03b31 in Eq.(14) is singular near the point t = T\nwhere \u03b31 (t) \u2248 2(T1\u2212t) . In parti ular, the small damping\nondition \u03b31 \u226a \u03c90 breaks down near this point. Thus,\nwe should spe ify under what ondition utting o\u001b \u03b31 (t)\nat time T \u2212 \u2206t (where \u03b31 (t) \u226a \u03c90 still holds) will have\nnegligible e\u001be t on the \u001cdelity. Expanding Eq.(15) for\nt = T \u2212 \u2206t with \u03b3\u2206t \u226a 1 (and e\u22122\u03b3T \u226a 1) yields\n1\u2212F =\n\nWe see that an additional requirement of the form \u03b3\u2206t \u226a\n1 \u2212 F appears to ensure high \u001cdelity. Re alling the\nasymptoti behavior of \u03b31 (t) near t = T and the small\ndamping ondition \u03b3i \u226a \u03c90 , one obtains a su\u001e ient\nondition for a hieving arbitrary high \u001cdelity (for long\nenough T )\n\u03c90 \u226b \u03b31max \u226b\n\n\u03b32\n,\n1\u2212F\n\n(18)\n\n\f3\n1\nwhere \u03b31max = 2\u2206t\n.

Before dis ussing\nthe implementation of the time-dependent swit hing we\nshow how a single LC ir uit oupled to a line with onstant oupling evolves a ording to Eqs.(1) and (2). The\ngeneralization to the ase where ea h of the os illators is\na olle tive mode of a ombination of several LC ir uits\npresents no spe ial di\u001e ulties.\nConsidering an ideal LC ir uit oupled to a transmission line with a (real) impedan e R, the Heisenberg\nequations of motions (see e.g., Eq. (3.14) in [11\u2104) are\ndxi\ndxi,in\nd2 xi\n+ 2\u03b3i\n+ \u03c902 xi = 4\u03b3i\n,\ndt2\ndt\ndt\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nIf the line, apa itor and indu tor are in series, then xi\nin Eq. (22) stands for the harge on the apa itor and\nR\n\u03b3i = 2L\n. If they are in parallel, then xi stands for the\n1\n. In both\nvoltage drop over the apa itor and \u03b3i = 2RC\nases, \u03b3i is the damping oe\u001e ient and sin e the energy\nof the LC os illator is transferred to the line, \u03b3i also determines the os illator-line oupling strength. xi,in and\nxi,out are the transmission line harge (for series ir uit)\nor voltage (for parallel ir uit) ex itation modes propagating towards and away from the os illator at the point\nwhere it joins the transmission line [11\u2104:\nxi,\u03b1 (t) = NR\n\nZ\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212s/2 ai,\u03b1 (\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9(t+q\u03b1\n\nyi\nv\n\n)\n\nq\n\nthe harge ex itations and NR = h\u0304R\n4\u03c0 , s = \u22121 for the\nvoltage ex itations. qin = 1, qout = \u22121.\nEq. (22) des ribes a damped os illator driven by the\nin oming modes in Eq. (24). With no damping and\ndriving its solution would have the usual form xi (t) =\n\u2206x0 (ai e\u2212i\u03c90 t + a\u2020i ei\u03c90 t ), where \u2206x0 is the ground state\n\u001du tuation (for the harge in the series LC ir uit \u2206x0 =\nq\nh\u0304\n2\u03c90 L , for the voltage in the parallel LC ir uit \u2206x0 =\nq\n\nh\u0304\u03c90\n2C\n\n). Assuming a small damping, \u03b3i \u226a \u03c90 , we write\n\u0011\n\u0010\nxi (t) = \u2206x0 ai (t)e\u2212i\u03c90 t + a\u2020i (t)ei\u03c90 t ,\n\n(25)\n\ndxi\n= \u2212i\u03c90 \u2206x0 (ai e\u2212i\u03c90 t \u2212 a\u2020i ei\u03c90 t )\ndt\n\n(26)\n\nwhere now ai (t) are slowly varying fun tions (still satisfying bosoni ommutation relations). Negle ting derivatives whi h are not multiplied by a large parameter su h\nas \u03c90 (slowly varying envelope approximation) we write\n\nand\nd2 xi\n= \u2212\u03c902 xi \u2212 2i\u03c90 \u2206x0\ndt2\n\ndai \u2212i\u03c90 t da\u2020i i\u03c90 t\ne\n\u2212\ne\ndt\ndt\n\n!\n\n.(27)\n\nTo separate the slow and the fast ontribution from the\ntransmission line modes we approximate Eq. (24) by\nxi,\u03b1 (t) =\n\nand\nxi = xi,in + xi,out .\n\nposition is well de\u001cned if the ir uit is assumed to be\n'lumped', i.e. mu h smaller in size than the wave length\nof the transmission line ex itation. The ai,out/in 's are the\nannihilation operators of the line ex itations\nsatisfying\nq\nh\u0304\nbosoni ommutation relations. NR = 4\u03c0R , s = 1 for\n\n+ h.c.

Eq. (28) is a (Markov) approximation sin e the lower integration limit is extended\nto \u2212\u221e. It is justi\u001ced, be ause the assumption of small\ndamping means that the os illator responds only in a narrow frequen y band around \u03c90 . Under these assumptions\nthe Fourier transforms of bi,\u03b1 (\u03c9), de\u001cned by Eq. (3),\nsatisfy Eq. (4) (for \u03b1 = in, out). Setting yi = 0, making\nuse of Eqs. (25)-(28) and (3) in Eqs. (22) and (23), and\nseparating frequen ies one obtains Eqs. (1) and (2).\nFinally, we dis uss possible realizations of statetransfer setups involving time-dependent swit hing. In\nthe ase of opti al avities, if one is in possession of\nswit hes with swit hing times mu h faster than the round\ntrip travel time of light within the avity, omplete state\ntransfer ould be a hieved within one round trip time.\nIn fa t, a variety of fast avity dumping te hniques have\nbeen developed for pulsed opti al systems in whi h the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Two identi al harmoni os illators a1 and a2 oupled\nto opposite ends of a transmission line. An isolator (round\nobje t) pla ed on the line ensures a unidire tional setup modes are propagating from os illator 1 to 2 and from 2 to\nthe termination. A possible implementation of an os illator as\nthe antisymmetri mode of two lumped ir uit resonators is\nshown in the inset above os illator 1. This geometry enables\ngood ontrol of the os illator-line oupling needed for the state\ntransfer. In the symmetri ase when C1 = C2 and L1 = L2\nthe antisymmetri mode I1 = I2 has a voltage node at point\nA and therefore does not radiate into the transmission line. If\nthe values of the apa itors or indu tors are hanged to spoil\nthe symmetry, this mode ouples into the line.\n\nswit hing time is onsiderably faster than the round trip\ntime [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\u2104. The state transfer te hnique analyzed above is, thus, of most interest in ases\nwhere swit hes fast ompared to the round trip time are\nnot available, su h as the ase of opti al avities with\nshort round trip times. Many avity dumping te hniques\n[14, 18\u2104 ould be adapted to provide the time-dependent\noupling Eq. (14) required for os illator 1 and a swit hing time that is fast ompared to the ring-down time for\nos illator 2.\nSin e super ondu ting ele troni s operating in the mirowave frequen y range is a ontender for quantum omputation, how to a hieve fast high \u001cdelity quantum state\ntransfer between mi rowave avities or lumped ir uit\nLC resonators has be ome an issue of interest. Cavity dumping te hniques have been employed to produ e\nintense mi rowave pulses from low intensity mi rowave\nsour es [20, 21\u2104. These te hniques often position the output port at a avity node. Coupling to the outside world\nis a hieved by swit hing the length of one arm of the avity so that the output port is no longer positioned at the\nnode. The inset above os illator 1 in Fig. 1 shows a way\nin whi h this idea an be implemented in a resonator\nonsisting of lumped ir uit omponents. If C1 = C2\nand L1 = L2 , the antisymmetri mode of os illation, for\nwhi h I1 = I2 , has a voltage node at A and therefore\ndoes not radiate into the transmission line. By hanging the value of one or more of the indu tors or apa itors, the symmetry is spoiled, point A will no longer be\na node and this mode will now radiate into the transmission line. The oupling strength is determined by the size\n\nof the shift from symmetry. A oupling of the form Eq.\n(14) an thus be engineered through the use of apa itors and indu tors having a ontrollable time-dependent\nrea tan e. Time dependent rea tan es are generally produ ed from nonlinear rea tors by hanging the operating\npoint of the rea tan e through the appli ation of bias\nurrents or voltages. Examples of a nonlinear rea tan e\nthat ould be used for su h an appli ation are Josephson jun tions whi h fun tion as nonlinear indu tors, and\nvara tor diodes whi h fun tion as nonlinear apa itors.\nTo summarize, we have shown that a transfer of\nan arbitrary quantum state between two identi al harmoni os illators (opti al resonators, ele troni os illators, et ) oupled to distant ends of a transmission\nline an be a hieved with a state-independent \u001cdelity\nthat approa hes unity exponentially fast in the oupling\nswit hing-time.\nK.
