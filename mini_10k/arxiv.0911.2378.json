Among these, stability of the dark\nmatter particles is often listed. However, perfect dark matter stability is merely an\nassumption, where we really only have a lower bound on the lifetime of dark matter\nparticles from the fact that we observe their presence in the Universe today. One reason\nfor the popularity of this assumption may be that in the most commonly studied class of\ndark matter candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs, in particular\nthe lightest neutralino), it is difficult to plausibly achieve a sufficiently long lifetime\nunless the decay of dark matter particles into Standard Model particles is completely\nforbidden by a symmetry. Nevertheless, there are some well-motivated dark matter\ncandidates which decay with lifetimes well in excess of the age of the Universe.\n\nUNSTABLE DARK MATTER AND INDIRECT DETECTION\nAside from WIMPs, super-weakly interacting massive particles (super-WIMPs such as\nthe gravitino) are natural dark matter candidates with typically very long lifetimes. A\nmoderate suppression of their couplings is often enough to obtain a lifetime compatible\nwith dark matter, without the need to impose any exact symmetries. However, when\nsuch unstable dark matter particles eventually decay, they produce ordinary Standard\nModel particles in the process which may be detectable in cosmic-ray measurements\nif the decay rate is sufficiently high. Suitable channels for indirect dark matter seaches\ninclude primarily antimatter as well as diffuse gamma rays.\nThe satellite experiments PAMELA [1] and Fermi LAT [2] have recently measured,\nrespectively, a dramatic rise in the positron fraction between 10 and 100 GeV, and a\n\n\fsmooth, featureless electron-plus-positron flux at energies up to 1 TeV that is harder than\nexpected. It is interesting to entertain the possibility that these high-energy positrons, left\nunexplained by conventional production and propagation models, stem from the decay\nor self-annihilation of dark matter particles in the Galactic halo. In contrast to the more\nwidely studied case of dark matter annihilation, where the rate of cosmic rays produced\nis proportional to the square of the dark matter density, in the case of dark matter decay\nthe source term is linear in the dark matter density profile. This leads to some important\nqualitative differences. Generally, there is no enhancement of indirect signals (\"boost\nfactors\") resulting from substructures in regions with high dark matter concentrations.\nFurthermore, the results for cosmic-ray fluxes are more robust as they are less sensitive\nto uncertainties in the distribution of dark matter in the Galactic halo.\n\nCONSTRAINTS ON DARK MATTER PROPERTIES\nSince positrons propagating in the interstellar medium efficiently lose energy by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, the high-energy positrons and electrons observed by PAMELA and Fermi must originate from a local source. The decay or self-annihilation of dark matter particles is a possible candidate, with e+ e\u2212 pairproduction in the magnetic fields of nearby pulsars being the most popular astrophysical\nalternative (see e.g. [3]).\nUnder the assumption that dark matter decay is indeed the origin of the high-energy\npositrons, we analyzed various decay modes for scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates in a model-independent manner in order to understand which dark matter properties can be inferred from these observations [4]. We sampled various dark matter masses,\nwhile treating the dark matter lifetime as a free parameter. For a scalar dark matter particle, we examined the two-body decays \u03c6DM \u2192 l+ l\u2212 , Z 0 Z 0 , W \u00b1W \u2213 , with l = e, \u03bc ,\n\u03c4 being the charged leptons. The resulting injection spectra of positrons from fragmentation of the weak gauge bosons were obtained using the PYTHIA 6.4 Monte Carlo\ncode. For a fermionic dark matter particle, we examined the two- and three-body decay\nmodes \u03c8DM \u2192 l+ l\u2212 \u03bd , Z 0 \u03bd , W \u00b1 l\u2213 , where the three-body decays are assumed to be mediated by a heavy scalar particle, motivated by the interesting example of a hidden-sector\ngaugino as a dark matter candidate [5]. After production, charged cosmic rays undergo a\ncomplicated propagation process in the magnetic halo of our Galaxy, including diffusion\non magnetic inhomogeneities, energy loss, convection, and annihilation in the Galactic\ndisk. We modeled these processes by means of a semi-analytical model to propagate the\ninjection spectra of positrons and antiprotons to our position in the Galaxy.\nThe requirement that dark matter decay be able to account for the PAMELA anomaly\nyields a typical dark matter lifetime of around 1026 sec, which exceeds the age of the\nUniverse by a factor 109 . Furthermore, since the rise in the positron fraction extends to\nat least 100 GeV, the dark matter mass must be at least twice as large. The positrons generated in the fragmentation of weak gauge bosons are generally found to have an energy\nspectrum which after propagation is too flat to match the steep rise in the positron fraction. Likewise, the positrons stemming from third-generation leptons in two- or threebody dark matter decays tend to produce too flat a spectrum unless the dark matter\nparticle is very heavy (which seems to be in conflict with H.E.S.S. observations that\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Scalar dark matter decaying to two muons with a lifetime of \u223c 1026 sec. Left panel:\npositron fraction, right panel: total electron-plus-positron flux. Dotted lines: mDM = 600 GeV, solid lines:\nmDM = 2500 GeV. The data points plotted in red are from PAMELA and Fermi LAT, respectively.\n\nseem to indicate a steepening of the total electron flux above 1 TeV [6]). However, the\nhard leptons from two- and three-body decays of dark matter particles into the first two\ngenerations (or flavor-democratic decays into all three generations) are found to reproduce the rise in the positron fraction quite accurately. Additionally taking the Fermi\ndata into account, and requiring dark matter decay to explain both data sets simultaneously, one needs the dark matter mass to be as heavy as a few TeV. Furthermore, the\nnon-observation of prominent spectral features in the total electron flux disfavors decays purely into the first generation of leptons [7] since these typically generate distinct\nspectral features in the total electron flux. Thus, decays into the second generation or\nflavor-democratic decays are favored by the Fermi results (see Fig. 1).\nOne might object to dark matter masses of several TeV as being unnatural. A possible\nsolution is the observation that the flux of cosmic rays from dark matter decay is invariant\nunder a simultaneous rescaling of dark matter abundance and lifetime. This opens the\npossibility of having a less abundant population of dark matter particles which decays\ninto the primary population of dark matter particles, which may be composed of stable\nWIMPs, such as in the standard neutralino dark matter scenario. Another interesting\nobservation is that a dark matter lifetime of 1026 sec may be understood in terms of\nGrand Unification, as a particle decaying via a dimension-6 operator suppressed by a\nmass scale M has the right lifetime if M is to be close to the GUT scale.\nIn addition to electron measurements, constraints arising from measurements of the\nantiproton flux and the measurement of diffuse gamma rays have to be taken into account. In particular, measurements of the antiproton-to-proton ratio by PAMELA [8]\nagree with astrophysical expectations and thus forbid any sizable contributions to the total antiproton flux from dark matter decay, strongly disfavoring hadronic decay modes.\nFurthermore, measurements of diffuse gamma rays by EGRET and Fermi LAT provide\nstringent upper bounds on gamma-ray production. Namely, dark matter decay itself, as\nwell as inverse Compton scattering of high-energy electrons and positrons produced in\nthese decays, generates a contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray flux which can be of\nthe same order as the extragalactic gamma-ray background for the decay modes and\nlifetimes favored by the PAMELA and Fermi observations. This contribution might actually be observed as a deviation from the expected power-law behavior of the extra-\n\n\fgalactic background. Another handle on indirect detection could be the observation of\nlarge-scale anisotropies in diffuse gamma rays that are expected due to the fact that we\nare located far from the center of the Galactic dark matter halo. The resulting dipole-like\nanisotropy should be accessible to Fermi LAT provided that dark matter decay is indeed\nthe correct explanation for the observed cosmic-ray anomalies [9].\n\nDECAYING GRAVITINO DARK MATTER\nGravitino dark matter in models with R-parity violation is a particularly interesting example of a decaying dark matter candidate. It has been observed that gravitino dark\nmatter together with a high reheating temperature and a very small amount of R-parity\nviolation can yield a consistent cosmology including thermal leptogenesis and primordial nucleosynthesis [10]. We restrict ourselves here to gravitino masses below 600 GeV,\nas motivated by universal boundary conditions at the GUT scale.\nFor gravitino masses of order 100 GeV, the branching ratio for the R-parity-violating\ndecay mode \u03c83/2 \u2192 W \u00b1 l\u2213 is around 50%, with the hard leptons from these twobody decays providing a possible source of high-energy positrons. From the modelindependent considerations above we can conclude that the R-parity violation must\neither be flavor-blind or otherwise yield a rather large fraction of decays into the first\ntwo lepton generations. It is indeed possible to reproduce the rise in the positron fraction\nunder this assumption while remaining compatible with antiproton bounds for certain\nsets of propagation parameters. Nevertheless, since we are only regarding gravitino\nmasses below 600 GeV, one still requires astrophysical sources such as pulsars to\naccount for the hard high-energy electron spectrum observed by Fermi, as these electrons\ncannot originate from the decay of such relatively \"light\" dark matter particles [11].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank W.
