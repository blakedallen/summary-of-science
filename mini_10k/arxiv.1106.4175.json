The repulsion between excitons leads to\nthe blueshift of polariton energy. When the pump is itself blue-detuned from the polariton resonance, a strong\npositive feedback loop between the resonance energy and\nthe field amplitude is created in a certain range of system parameters, resulting in sharp jumps in the intracavity field and, hence, in the cavity transmission. Consequently, the transmission signal can exhibit a promi-\n\nnent hysteresis in the dependence on continuous-wave\n(cw) pump intensity.3,8\nThe response of the optically excited polariton system\nbecomes more complicated with allowance made for exciton spin degrees of freedom (that corresponds to arbitrary optical polarization of the intra-cavity field). In the\ngeneral case the system has up to four stable states under a given cw pump, whereas the actual state of the\nsystem is determined by the history of the excitation\nprocess.4,16 In critical points, where a number and/or\nstability of stationary solutions change, the system can\nexhibit sharp jumps in both the amplitude and polarization of the intra-cavity field. Under a spatially inhomogeneous (e. g., Gaussian shaped) cw excitation the system\ncan also exhibit a nontrivial spatial distribution of polarization of the luminescence signal, like the \"spin ring\"\npatterns,14 due to the same underlying phenomena.\nThe strong multistability effect predicted in Ref. 4\nhas recently been observed experimentally,5 including the\nsharp jumps in the cavity transmission under a smooth\nvariation of the pump polarization degree. The spin\nring patterns under Gaussian shaped excitation have also\nbeen reported.17,18 All these experiments were carried\nout under the cw excitation. Thus, one of the still remaining questions is the dynamical peculiarities of the\ntransitions in a multistable system, which could only be\ntraced using the time-resolved techniques. Particularly,\nthe characteristic switching times between different stability branches call for the experimental study, for they\ncan have a crucial impact upon the practical implementations.\n\n\f2\nAnother question concerns the theoretical approach allowing to describe the observed multistability effect in\nmicrocavities. Traditionally, the multistability is considered in terms of the self-acting classical fields corresponding to macro-occupied coherent polariton modes which\nappear under a coherent resonant excitation.3,4,14,15 Although such an approach is supposed to be sufficient to\ndescribe the bistability in a circularly polarized system,3\nit gives wrong predictions for the general case of elliptically polarized excitation.19 Most probably, the incoherent states of the exciton reservoir which are inevitably\nexcited in optical experiments have a substantial impact\non the decay rates and energies of polaritons. For instance, the nonlinear decay of polaritons with different\ncircular polarizations was taken into consideration in order to explain the experimental data in Ref. 5. Further,\nthe nonequilibrium transitions reported in Ref. 17 can\nonly be reproduced in calculations taking into account\nthe reservoir induced shifts of the polariton energy.\nIn the present work we report the experimental study\nof nonequilibrium transitions in the multistable cavity\npolariton system. Unlike in recent Refs. 5, 17, and 18,\nwe have studied the optically polarized system under a\npulsed nanosecond-long excitation, which allowed us to\ntrace the time-resolved dynamics of the intra-cavity field.\nThe shifts in polariton energy were reflected by temporal\nvariations in the transmission energy spectrum. Thus,\nthe employed technique is capable of visualizing the temporal correlations between the resonance energy and intensity of the intra-cavity field.\nWe discuss in detail the time dependence of the transmission signal polarization, below as well as above the\nthreshold, for several polarizations of the pump beam.\nThe observed polarization behavior cannot be reproduced within a semi-classical model based on the GrossPitaevskii equations considered in Refs. 4, 14, and 16.\nThe experimental results allowed us to develop a phenomenological model to describe a multistable polariton\nsystem with a proper regard to the exciton reservoir. The\nreservoir excitons shift the polariton energy that, in turn,\ninfluences the thresholds of nonequilibrium transitions.\nBoth the linear and nonlinear mechanisms of exciton\nscattering into the reservoir are found to be significant\nwithin a sub-nanosecond time scale. While the nonlinear\ndecay of cross-circularly polarized excitons leads to the\nlevelling of the \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212 jump points (which has also\nbeen found in Refs. 5 and 17 in the cw pump regime),\nthe linear decay mechanism leads to the temporal delay\nof the jumps with respect to the pump intensity peak.\nFurther, we apply the developed approach to simulate\nthe parametric scattering under pumping at the magic\nangle. As we show, this model allows to explain selfconsistently the temporal dependences of polarizations\nof both the driven mode and the scattering signal which\nappears at the polariton branch bottom.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the available models of the multistability effect are considered and\ncompared with each other in view of the recent experi-\n\nmental results of Refs. 5, 17, and 19. Sec. III references\nthe experimental setup. Sec. IV contains the experimental results and compares them with the calculations performed in the framework of the suggested model, for the\ncases of pumping at normal incidence (Sec. IV A) and\nat the magic angle (Sec. IV B), with a brief reference to\nsome of the still unresolved issues (Sec. IV C). The results\nare summarized in Conclusion (Sec. V).\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL MODELS\n\nThe multistability effects in microcavities were recently\nconsidered in the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii equations written for the macro-occupied polariton modes.4,14\nThese equations can also be written for the strongly coupled exciton and photon fields (P and E respectively) in\nthe cavity active layer:16\ni\u0116+ = (\u03c9c \u2212 i\u03b3c ) E+ + \u03b1F+ + \u03b2P+ ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\u0116\u2212 = (\u03c9c \u2212 i\u03b3c ) E\u2212 + \u03b1F\u2212 + \u03b2P\u2212 ,\n\n(2)\n\u0001\ni\u1e56+ = \u03c9x + V1 |P+ | + V2 |P\u2212 | \u2212 i\u03b3x P+ + AE+ , (3)\n\u0001\ni\u1e56\u2212 = \u03c9x + V2 |P+ |2 + V1 |P\u2212 |2 \u2212 i\u03b3x P\u2212 + AE\u2212 (4)\n2\n\n2\n\n(in the \u03c3 \u00b1 basis). Here, F stands for the incident electric\nfield that is usually treated as a plane wave: F\u00b1 \u221d e\u2212i\u03c9p t ;\n\u03c9c,x and \u03b3c,x are the eigenfrequencies and decay rates of\nthe intra-cavity photon and exciton modes; \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\nthe cavity response\u221acoefficients, and A is exciton polarizability (so that 2 A\u03b2 equals Rabi splitting); V1,2 are\nthe matrix elements of the interaction between excitons\nwith same (V1 ) and opposite (V2 ) circular polarizations.\nFor simplicity, Eqs. (1\u20134) are written for only the\ndriven polariton mode with zero quasi-momentum, although they can be easily generalized to the case of essentially many-mode system.16 In the latter case, the usage of the exciton-photon basis (instead of the simplified\npolariton basis) brings the advantage of taking account\nof the TE/TM splitting effects as well as the angular dependence of the polariton interaction constants. As will\nbe shown below, it is also convenient for taking account\nof the incoherent exciton reservoir.\nThe multistability conditions are defined by the relation between exciton-exciton interaction constants, V1\nand V2 . According to the study of polariton spin quantum beats in a GaAs cavity,20 the cross-circularly polarized excitons exhibit attraction (V2 < 0) that is\nweaker than the repulsive interaction of co-circular excitons (V1 > 0 and |V2 | < V1 ). The fact that V2 is\nnegative is also confirmed by the rotation of polariton\npolarization direction during the process of parametric\nscattering.21 In the general case the processes of excitonexciton interaction are mediated by biexciton and dark\nexciton states,22\u201324 hence the relation between the interaction constants of polaritons can be dependent on the\nexciton-photon detuning.25 More precisely, one should\nalso consider the saturation of excitonic transitions as an\n\n\f3\nadditional nonlinear mechanism affecting the blueshift of\npolaritons under a sufficiently strong excitation.26\nIf V1 > 0 and V2 . 0 (as assumed in Refs. 4, 14, and\n16 basing on the experimental estimations of Ref. 20),\nthen the \u03c3 \u00b1 -components of the intra-cavity field are almost uncoupled. If V2 < 0, then the threshold intensity\nW = |F+ |2 + |F\u2212 |2 of linearly polarized pump is at least\ntwo times larger than that of circularly polarized pump:\n(lin)\n(circ)\nWthr & 2Wthr .\n(lin)\nContrary to the above predictions, Wthr has been\n(circ)\nfound to be slightly less than Wthr\nin the experiments using cw as well as time-resolved pumping\ntechniques.5,17,19,27 In order to explain it, two theoretical approaches have been proposed. The first one5,28\npresumes a repulsive interaction of polaritons with opposite pseudospins (\u03c3 \u00b1 polarizations) in the framework of\nGross-Pitaevskii equations of type (1)\u2013(4). The second\napproach17,29 considers the additional blueshift resultant\n(lin)\n(circ)\nfrom an exciton reservoir, which leads to Wthr < Wthr\nwithout the necessity for a repulsive interaction between\ncross-circularly polarized excitons. (A somewhat similar\nmodel has previously been proposed in Ref. 30 to describe\nthe interaction of a \"spinless\" polariton condensate with\na reservoir.)\nIn the present work we explore the second model\naccounting for the transitions of the optically driven\nexcitons into the incoherent (reservoir) state in which\nthe overall pseudospin is relaxed, so that the reservoir\nprovides equal blueshifts for both polarization components of the coherent state.17,29 Those transitions are introduced phenomenologically as non-radiative decays of\nbright excitons accorded with the rate of occupation of\nthe optically inactive reservoir. The model for the intracavity electric field E and exciton polarization P coupled\nwith the integral population of the reservoir N can be\nwritten as\ni\u0116+ = (\u03c9c \u2212 i\u03b3c ) E+ + \u03b1F+ + \u03b2P+ ,\n\n(5)\n\ni\u0116\u2212 = (\u03c9c \u2212 i\u03b3c ) E\u2212 + \u03b1F\u2212 + \u03b2P\u2212 ,\n(6)\n\u0002\n2\n2\ni\u1e56+ = \u03c9x + V1 |P+ | + V2 |P\u2212 | + (V1 + V2 ) N /2 \u2212\n\u0001\u0003\ni \u03b3x + \u03b3xr + Vr |P\u2212 |2 P+ + AE+ ,\n(7)\n\u0002\n2\n2\ni\u1e56\u2212 = \u03c9x + V1 |P\u2212 | + V2 |P+ | + (V1 + V2 ) N /2 \u2212\n\u0001\u0003\n(8)\ni \u03b3x + \u03b3xr + Vr |P+ |2 P\u2212 + AE\u2212 ,\n\u0001\n\u1e44 = \u2212\u03b3r N + 2\u03b3xr |P+ |2 + |P\u2212 |2 +\n4Vr |P+ |2 |P\u2212 |2 .\n\n(9)\n\nThis model is a generalization of Eqs. (1)\u2013(4). Here, \u03b3xr\nis an additional decay rate of excitons that corresponds\nto the linear mechanism of light absorption, providing\nthe term 2\u03b3xr (|P+ |2 + |P\u2212 |2 ) in Eq. (9); Vr stands for the\nrate of nonlinear interaction between P\u00b1 that provides\nan additional occupation of the reservoir (4Vr |P+ |2 |P\u2212 |2\nper unit time) due to the mixture of excitons with opposite polarizations; \u03b3r stands for the reservoir own decay rate.31 Microscopically, the nonlinear absorption of\n\ncross-circularly polarized excitons is resultant from the\nscattering of a pair of bright excitons with opposite spins\n(Jz = \u22121 and Jz = +1) into dark excitons (Jz = \u22122\nand Jz = +2), which is closely related to biexciton creation (see Ref. 22 for details). We do not consider the\nreverse transitions of incoherent (reservoir) excitons into\nthe driven mode; this approximation is valid as long as\nthe occupation of the reservoir states is small enough.\nUnder resonant pumping at k = 0 the energy mismatch\nof the pump with respect to free exciton makes the filling\nof reservoir quite ineffective, but it is still possible due to\nenergy level broadening and non-zero temperature. The\nreservoir can accumulate excitation due to its comparatively long lifetime (see Sec. IV).\nEquations (5)\u2013(9) can easily be generalized to the\ncase of many-mode system, with exactly the same nonlinear interaction terms (which are \"local\" in the real\nspace), and a linear part being in the k-space the same\nas in Ref. 16. In the many-mode calculations represented below in Figs. 2, 3, and 11\u201313, the cavity dispersion EcTE,TM (k) and response coefficients \u03b1TE,TM (k),\n\u03b2TE,TM (k) for TE and TM cavity modes are properly\ntaken into account using the transfer matrix technique.32\nThe two models, Eqs. (1)\u2013(4) and (5)\u2013(9), can give\nsimilar predictions for the cases of circular and linear\npolarizations of excitation. In particular, the key experimental effect waiting for explanation-that the threshold\n(lin)\n(circ)\nof linearly polarized pump is smaller (Wthr . Wthr )-\ncan be reproduced within the Eqs. (1)\u2013(4) with V2 & V1 .\nNonetheless, the transitional dynamics under the intermediate pump polarizations 0 < \u03c1p < 1 are completely\ndifferent in the two systems, see an example in Fig. 1.\nIf V2 < 0 and Vr > 0 (Fig. 1a, solid line, and Fig. 1b),\nthe cavity transmission polarization increases with pump\nin the sub-threshold area, due to the dominant blueshift\nof the leading polarization component (\u03c1p = +0.6). On\nreaching the threshold, the leading component jumps up\nto the high-energy state, which causes a step-like increase in reservoir population and the blueshift of \u03c3 \u2212\nmode. Consequently, the minor mode also enters the\nabove-threshold area, and the degree of circular polarization (DCP) of transmission (\u03c1tr ) decreases down to\nthe values smaller than the pump DCP. The same effect results in formation of the spin ring patterns under\nthe Gaussian shaped excitation14,17,18 in a close vicinity\nof the threshold pump power (Fig. 2). As a matter of\nfact, the ring shaped pattern of DCP indicates that both\npolarization components reach the high-energy state at\nthe center of the pump spot where, therefore, the transmission DCP is minimal. The spatial distribution of \u03c1tr\n(Fig. 2d\u2013f ) exhibits a well pronounced minimum at x = 0\nalready when the threshold is surpassed by 1.5 times\n(Fig. 2e), in agreement with the experimental observations (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 17). This markedly differs from\na prediction of the conventional theory based on GrossPitaevskii equations4,14,16 with |V2 | \u226a V1 (see Fig. 3)\nwhich does not exhibit the rings even at W/Wthr \u2248 5 for\n\u03c1p = 0.6. The temporal dynamics for |V2 | \u226a V1 is shown\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2. The calculated \"spin ring\" pattern formation in\nthe framework of many-mode model Eqs. (5)\u2013(9) with Vr =\n0.6 * V1 , V2 = \u22120.1 * V1 , and \u03b3xr = 0 (explicitly as in Ref. 17).\nThe pump DCP is +0.6 (as in Fig. 1). Panels a\u2013e show the\nspatial distribution of intensity of the intra-cavity field in \u03c3 +\nand \u03c3 \u2212 polarization components (solid and dashed lines, respectively), for several values of pump power W ; the pump\ndistribution profile is shown by dotted lines. W0 roughly\ncorresponds to the threshold excitation density. Panels d\u2013f\nrepresent the corresponding spatial distribution of the intracavity field DCP.\n\nFIG. 1. (a) The calculated time dependence of the cavity transmission polarization under a slowly varying pump\n(transverse-dashed triangular line) with elliptical polarization.

(1)\u2013(4) with V2 /V1 = \u22120.1 (this ratio was used in Refs. 4\nand 14). Dash line corresponds to the case of V2 /V1 = +1.1.\nThe calculated data is time-averaged for each temporal point\nover 100 ps intervals, in order to eliminate the fast transitional effects which are not observable under the cw pump\nconditions.

First,\nthe transmission DCP decreases in the sub-threshold\narea, since an increase in the \"leading\" \u03c3 + component\nprovides a larger blueshift for \u03c3 \u2212 , so that the difference in\n\u03c3 \u00b1 intensities weakens with increasing pump. On reaching the threshold, \u03c1tr shows a minor step-like increase followed by the very weak changes with further increasing\n\nFIG. 3. The calculated spatial distribution of the intra-cavity\nfield for Vr = \u03b3xr = 0 and V2 = \u22120.1*V1 . All other parameters\ncoincide with those of Fig. 2. Unlike Fig. 2, almost no ring\nstructure appears in the cavity transmission DCP even at\nW/W0 = 5.\n\npump power. No prerequisites for the spin ring formation\nare satisfied in this case.\nThus, the observed phenomena-the disparity of\n(lin)\n(circ)\nthresholds, Wthr . Wthr , together with the field\npolarization dynamics-cannot be reproduced within\nEqs.

The experiments revealing both\n\n\f5\nthe energy (blueshift) and polarization dynamics of the\ndriven polariton mode under the nanosecond-long excitation pulses are described below in Sec. IV.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe microcavity structure grown by a metal-organic\nvapor-phase epitaxy technique has top (bottom) Bragg\nreflectors composed of 17 (20) \u03bb/4 Al0.13 Ga0.87 As/AlAs\nlayers. The 3\u03bb/2 GaAs cavity contains six 10 nm thick\nIn0.06 Ga0.94 As/GaAs quantum wells. The Rabi splitting is about 6 meV. A gradual variation of the active\nlayer thickness along the sample provides a change in\nthe photon mode energy Ec = ~\u03c9c and, accordingly, in\nthe detuning \u2206 between the exciton Ex (k =0 ) and photon Ec (k = 0) mode energies. Experiments are carried\nout in several regions of the same sample with \u2206 \u2248 0\n(Sec. IV A) and \u2206 \u2248 \u22121.5 meV (Sec. IV B).\nThe sample is placed into the optical cryostat with\ncontrolled temperature. To excite the cavity, we use a\npulsed Ti:sapphire laser producing picosecond long pulses\nat a repetition rate of 5 kHz. Prior to coming into the\ncryostat, the pulses pass trough a long multi-mode optical fiber and then through a monochromator. After the\nfiber, the pulses have a duration of about 1 ns, and after the monochromator they have spectral full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 meV. The excitation is\nperformed either along the normal to the cavity plane\n(kp = 0) or at the magic angle (kp = 1.8 \u03bcm\u22121 ) slightly\nabove the lower polariton branch resonance, with various pump polarizations (circular, linear, or elliptical).\nThe main axis of pump polarization is directed along the\nh110i axis of the structure. The pump beam is focused\nonto the spot with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm. The kinetics of the cavity transmission signal Itr (t) is detected at\nT \u2248 6 K by the streak camera with spectral, angular, and\ntime resolution of 0.28 meV, 0.5\u25e6 , and 70 ps, respectively,\nin various polarizations. The temporal dependences of\nthe signal are averaged over \u223c 104 pulses, for we have to\ncollect the signal in order to eliminate noises.\n\nIV.\n\nA.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND\nDISCUSSION\nPumping at normal incidence (kp = 0)\n\nThe information on the intra-cavity field kinetics is obtained from the cavity transmission measurements.12,33\nThe active region of the cavity is separated from a detector by the Bragg mirror that does not introduce any\nnonlinearity and/or spectral selectivity. Thus, the intensity of the transmission signal, Itr (\u03c9, t), is proportional to the squared magnitude of the intra-cavity elec2\ntric\nR field |E(kp , \u03c9,\nR t)| , and the first momentum \u0112 =\n~ \u03c9Itr (\u03c9, t) d\u03c9/ Itr (\u03c9, t) d\u03c9 at k = kp reflects the time\n\nFIG. 4.

The spectra are recorded in\nthe same \u03c3 + polarization; the fraction of signal in the\nopposite polarization (\u03c3 \u2212 ) does not exceed a few percent. At low peak excitation density W \u2261 maxt Itr (t) \u2248\n9.5 kW/cm2 the maximum of the signal is found at the\nlow energy side of the excitation, near the lower polariton eigenfrequency. Although the blueshift in polariton\nenergy remains relatively small, the time dependence of\nthe signal differs markedly from that of the pump pulse.\nThis indicates the onset of nonlinear processes at the red\nedge of pump spectrum. In particular, the maximum of\nthe signal is delayed for a few hundred picoseconds with\nrespect to the pump peak. Nonlinearities in both the\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5.

The top panels show the\ntime shape of the exciting pulse. Left and right panels represent the experimental and calculated data, respectively. In\nthe experiment, W = 28.5 kW/cm2 .\n\nmagnitude and spectral position of the signal increase\nwith pump power: as the peak energy of the signal shifts\nup to the pump energy Ep , (i) the signal intensity shows\nthe superlinear (threshold like) increase and (ii) the time\nwhen the signal reaches its maximum value shifts backward to the onset of excitation pulse.\nThe observed correlation between the energy blueshift\nand intensity of the signal is expected in the framework\nof the multistability model4 Eqs. (1)\u2013(4), however this\nmodel fails to explain the process of instability development. Figures 4e\u2013h show that the observed time and\nspectral dependences can be qualitatively reproduced in\nsimulations using Eqs. (5)\u2013(9) with appropriate time and\nenergy shapes of the excitation (see Appendix). The chosen parameters of microcavity coincide with those used in\nthe experiment; the constants of interaction with reservoir are considered below.\nThe temporal dependence of transmission under the\nexcitation with linearly, elliptically and circularly polarized pulses (DCPs 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 1) at W =\n28.5 kW/cm2 is shown in Fig. 5. The temporal delay\nof the dominating \u03c3 + and \u03c0x polarization components of\nthe signal with respect to the pump peak is seen to be\n\nFIG. 6.

The spectrum of intra-cavity filed in \u03c3 \u00b1 components in the range of polarization instability (experiment).\nWeighted mean values of the energy \u0112\u00b1 are indicated by arrows.\n\nin the range of 150 \u2013 200 ps, which is much larger than\nthe lifetime of polaritons with k = 0. The \"anomalous\"\nincrease in the intra-cavity field observed in the range\nof decreasing pump power (after the pump peak is already passed) can be explained by the blueshift in effective polariton energy. In turn, this blueshift could only\nbe provided by the long-lived polariton states accumulated during the pulse. Such an effect corresponds to the\n\"linear\" process of polariton scattering into the exciton\n\n\f7\nreservoir, which is determined by the ratio between \u03b3r\nand \u03b3xr in Eqs. (7)\u2013(9). The experimental results are\nqualitatively reproduced in numerical simulations with\nV2 /V1 = \u22120.1, Vr /V1 = 7 * 10\u22123 , ~\u03b3r = 2 * 10\u22123 meV,\nand \u03b3xr = 3 * 10\u22123 meV. These parameters are chosen to\nmeet the following conditions: (i) the overall occupation\nof the reservoir is comparable to that of the driven (op(lin)\n(circ)\ntically active) polariton mode, so that Wthr . Wthr ,\nand (ii) the temporal peak of the signal can be delayed\nby hundreds of picoseconds with respect to the excitation\npeak even for \u03c1p = \u00b11. Note the long decay times of the\nreservoir states, \u223c 300 ps. So long times are characteristic of excitons localized due to fluctuations of quantum\nwell potential and/or free excitons with large lateral wave\nnumbers.\nFigures 5b and 5e reveal the transmission signal to\nbe retaining both circular and linear pump polarizations; in these cases only a weak depolarization of the\ntransmitted light is observed. Retaining of the circular polarization in agreement with the angular momentum conservation law is expected. Measurements performed under linearly polarized pump in a wide range\nof W = 9.5 \u2212 28.5 kW/cm2 (not shown) have revealed\nthe magnitude of transmitted light depolarization to be\nwithin the limits of 12\u201317%, almost independently of the\npump power. On the other hand, under the elliptically\npolarized excitation (0 < \u03c1p < 1) the signal DCP does\ndepend on the pump intensity due to the anisotropy in\npolariton-polariton interaction.4 Accordingly, the ratio\nbetween both circularly and linearly polarized components of the signal intensity (\u03c3 \u00b1 and \u03c0x,y , respectively)\nvaries with time (Fig. 5c,d ). The corresponding temporal dependences of the degrees of circular and linear\npolarizations of the signal are shown in Fig. 6. From\ncomparison of Figs. 5 and 6, it is seen that the reaching\nof maximum signal intensity at t \u2248 0.2 ns is accompanied\nby a decrease in the signal DCP, in much the same way\nas the cw driven system behaves (Fig. 1), though the latter system exhibits the expectedly sharper transitions.\nOn the other hand, our experimental technique allows\nus to visualize the energies of intra-cavity field in addition to their intensities. The information on the energies\nis extracted from the transmission spectra as shown in\nFig. 7 since Itr (~\u03c9) \u221d |E(~\u03c9)|2 . The energies of intracavity field in \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212 polarizations demonstrate a\nwell pronounced blueshift with increasing polariton density and a well pronounced splitting. In particular it is\nseen in Fig. 7 that in the range of maximum polarization\nthe \u03c3 + component of the field is markedly (by 0.3 meV)\nblue-shifted with respect to \u03c3 \u2212 .\nThe basis in which shown degree of linear polarization\n(DLP) was measured is related to the pump polarization\naxis. We observe no linear polarization in the basis rotated by 45\u25e6 with respect to the former one. Thus, the\nsum of squared Stokes parameters per signal intensity\nis less than 1, which means that the signal is partially\ndepolarized; this is because the signal polarization components are measured as averaged quantities.\n\nFIG. 8. Time dependences of the transmission DCPs, for\nseveral values of the pump power W , under excitation with\nelliptically polarized pulses with \u03c1p = 0.4. Grey dotted line\ncorresponds to the normalized temporal shape of excitation.\nLeft and right panels represent experimental and calculated\ndata, respectively.\n\nIn order to clarify the physics underlying the signal polarization transitions, let us consider the series of measurements performed under elliptically polarized pulses\nwith \u03c1p = 0.4 and various pump intensities. Fig. 8 represents measured (left side) and calculated (right side)\ntime dependences of the transmission signal in \u03c3 \u00b1 polarization components. From these series, the pump power\ndependence of the temporal delay between the signal and\npump peaks is evidenced. The certain conditions for a\nswitch in signal polarization depend on both the pump\nintensity and its temporal shape. In case of the very low\npump densities, the intra-cavity field is insufficient for\nmultistability to reveal; on the other hand, if the pump\ndensity is increasing quickly enough then a jump into a\nhigh-energy state happens with no delay related to the\nlong-lived reservoir, since most of the intra-cavity field\nis concentrated in the driven (optically active) polariton\nstate. Except the case of maximum W, the dynamics\nshown in Fig. 8 lies in the intermediate range of pump\npowers which all are insufficient to pull a polariton state\nby itself up to the threshold magnitude. Instead of that,\nthe non-equilibrium transitions proceed through the mediation of excitation accumulated by the reservoir. In\nsuch a case the development of instability in the leading\npolarization component (\u03c3 + ) always precedes the reservoir induced switch in signal polarization.\nFigure 9, which also shows a series for two peak pump\nintensities at fixed \u03c1p = 0.4, allows us to visualize the\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 9. Time dependences of the pump pulse intensity (a, e),\ndegrees of circular (b, f ) and linear (c, g) polarizations (DCP\nand DLP) of the transmitted pulse, and the weighted mean\nvalues \u0112\u00b1 of the transmission energy in \u03c3 + (thick lines) and\n\u03c3 \u2212 (thin lines) polarization components (d, h), for several\nvalues of the pump power W . The pump DCP is 0.4. The\nmean value of pump energy, which exhibits minor variations\nin a close vicinity of E \u2212 Ex = \u22122 meV, is shown by solid\nthin lines in panels (d, h). Left and right panels represent\nexperimental and calculated data, respectively.\n\ntemporal correlations between the energy (in both \u03c3 \u00b1\npolarization components) and polarization degree of the\ntransmission signal. The overall process of the instability\ndevelopment is accompanied by blueshifts in \u03c3 \u00b1 energies.\nAt the first stage (which starts the earlier, the higher is\npump density W ), the leading polarization component\n(\u03c3 + ) enters the region of positive feedback between its\neffective resonance energy \u0112+ and the \u03c3 + field amplitude, so the difference in \u03c3 \u00b1 energies grows along with\nthe DCP of transmission signal (Fig. 9b, d ). Accordingly, a well pronounced decrease in the DLP of transmission is observed at the same time interval (Fig. 9c). At\napproximately the half way through the energy growth\n(see panel d ), the integral occupation of reservoir becomes sufficient to provide the shift in the minor component (\u03c3 \u2212 ), which leads to decrease in both the energy difference \u0112+ \u2212 \u0112\u2212 and DCP, and to the corresponding increase in DLP. All these effects are qualitatively reproduced in calculations shown in Fig. 9e\u2013h.\nThus, the observed dynamics confirm the effect of reser-\n\nFIG. 10.

Left and right sides of the figure\nrepresent experimental and calculated data, respectively.\n\nvoir, though the energy broadening makes the transitions much smoother compared to the cw driven system\n(Fig. 1).\nFigure 10 shows the time delay of the signal with respect to the excitation pulse in a wider range of pump\npowers W; it summarizes the consideration of the threshold effects in the cavity transmission. The value of the\ndelay \u2206t is determined as the difference between the moments the signal and the pump reach their half-maxima\nfor the first time:\n\u2206t\u00b1 = t\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nItr\n(t)\u2192 21 maxt Itr\n(t)\n\n\u2212t\n\nIp (t)\u2192 12 maxt Ip (t)\n\n. (10)\n\nAt small W the response is linear, and the delays \u2206t are\nexpectedly small. At threshold, the superlinear growth\nof the signal is observed with \u2206t of about 150 to 200\npicoseconds, i. e. at the back front of excitation. Thus,\nthis transition is induced by the reservoir as explained\nabove. With further increasing W , the optically active\nfraction of excitons grows, which lowers the system's intertness, and the delay of response decreases. Note, that\nthe minor (\u03c3 \u2212 ) polarization component exhibits the superlinear growth at the same peak power W as \u03c3 + , and\nthe relative delay of \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212 components, \u2206t+ \u2212 \u2206t\u2212 ,\nremains nearly constant above the threshold. This is an\nextra evidence of the fact that the jump in the minor\ncomponent is provided by the reservoir even at high W.\n\n\f9\nB.\n\nPumping at the magic angle (kp = 1.8 \u03bcm\u22121 )\n\nLet us now consider the polarization properties of\nthe signal of parametric scattering-generally referred to\nas cavity \"optic parametric oscillator\" (OPO) signal2 -\nwhich appears at the branch bottom (k = 0) if pumping\nis at the magic angle (kp \u2248 1.8 \u03bcm\u22121 ). There are two\npoints to discuss here. First, in the general case of elliptically polarized excitation the signal is expected to\nreflect variations in the DCP of the driven mode that, in\nturn, are shown to be strongly affected by the excitonic\nreservoir. Second, if the pump is polarized linearly, the\nexperiments show the 90\u25e6 rotation of the signal polarization axis;21 thus, we have to check if Eqs. (5)\u2013(9) can\nreproduce this effect in spite of the reservoir induced interaction between the cross-circularly polarized excitons.\nThe experiments are carried out at negative detuning\nbetween the photon and exciton (\u2206 \u2248 \u22121.5 meV) in order to have the pump frequency close to that employed\nfor the normal incidence pumping considered in Sec IV A.\nThe cavity and excitation parameters used in the simulations coincide with the experimental ones, whereas the\nnonlinear interaction constants as well as reservoir characteristics are the same as used in the previous Section.\nFigure 11 represents measured and calculated dynamics of intra-cavity field at k = kp (which corresponds to\nthe cavity transmission) and k = 0 (OPO signal) under elliptically polarized excitation with DCP = 0.5 and\ndifferent pump powers W. When W exceeds the critical value (in the experiment Wthr \u2248 10 kW/cm2 ), a well\npronounced superlinear growth of the cavity transmission (Fig. 11b) is observed at t = 0.1 \u2013 0.4 ns. Near the\nthreshold, a doubling of the pump power W leads to an\norder-of-magnitude growth of the OPO signal intensity\n(Fig. 11e). The observed nonlinearities indicate the onset of parametric instability, being, however, by far not\nas sharp as under cw excitation.11\nThe dynamics of the driven mode is similar to that\nunder the pumping at normal incidence. The growth\nof the field amplitude, which continues with increasing\npump density (Fig. 11b), expectedly leads to the growth\nof transmission DCP (Fig. 11c) due to the dominantly repulsive exciton-exciton interaction. At t = 0.1 \u2013 0.4 ns the\ntransmission starts to behave strongly nonlinearly with\nrespect to the driving field, and the peak of transmission\nbecomes significantly delayed with respect to the peak of\npump pulse. The latter indicates that the transition is\nassisted by the reservoir induced blueshift. Accordingly,\nthe jump in transmission DCP is immediately followed\nby dropping back as soon as the system enters the abovethreshold region where the energies of \u03c3 \u00b1 components of\nintra-cavity field (Fig. 11d ) become partially levelled due\nto the reservoir filling.\nThe domination of the leading polarization component\n(\u03c3 + ) is strongly enhanced in the OPO signal (Fig. 11f)\nwhose DCP reaches 0.85 at t \u2248 0.2 ns. The subsequent\nlowering of DCP of the driven mode forces the OPO signal, too, to partially loss its polarization. However, the\n\nFIG. 11.

However, a\nquantitative agreement is not achieved, partially due to\na complicated spectral shape of the pump pulses (see\nFig. 4) and due to intrinsic limitations of the suggested\ntheoretical model (see discussion in Sec. IV C).\nLet us turn to the case of exactly linear polarization of\nthe excitation at kp > 0 (Figs. 12 and 13). In this case\nthe OPO signal depends on whether the pump excites a\npure cavity state-one of TE and TM modes which are\nthe eigenstates of 2D photon in the empty cavity-or a\nmixture of both the TE and TM components. Fig. 12\nrepresents the dynamics of OPO signal under the pump\npolarized along the TM cavity mode. In the range of high\nintensity of the signal, its degree of linear polarization\n(DLP) reaches 90%. The polarization axis is 90\u25e6 rotated\nwith respect to the pump (what corresponds to negative\nDLP values), which is well reproduced in the calculations.\nOn the other hand, if the pump is polarized in between\n~ k [E~TE + E~TM ], Fig. 13), the\nthe TE and TM directions (F\nsignal DLP does not exceed 30% in the range of a strong\nsignal (Fig. 13e). The shown DLP values were measured\n(and calculated) in the basis of directions parallel and orthogonal to pump polarization; there is no marked DLP\nin the TE-TM basis as well. This effect is explained by\nthe lifted degeneracy (TE-TM splitting) of cavity modes\nwhich leads to the variation with time of the \u03c3 \u00b1 phase\nshift.

Due to\npermanent modification of the direction of signal polarization, the eventual OPO signal appears to be significantly depolarized (the sum of squared DCP and DLP is\nmarkedly less than 1, Fig. 13d, e).\nThus, the dynamics of the OPO signal confirms the effect of reservoir. Under elliptic excitation, the \u03c3 \u00b1 polarization components tend to be levelled by the reservoir.\nBy itself, this effect could be assigned to a repulsion between cross-circularly polarized excitons (V2 > 0). On\nthe other hand, the axis of signal polarization is found in-\n\n\f11\nverted with respect to the pump, which restricts the sign\nof V2 to be negative irrespectively of the reservoir induced\nblueshifts. Since we have reproduced these effects within\nEqs. (5)\u2013(9), it is proven to provide a self-consistent description of the intra-cavity field polarization dynamics.\n\nC.\n\nShortcomings\n\nWe have shown that the semi-phenomenological\nEqs. (5)\u2013(9) explain the observed polarization dynamics\nin a good qualitative agreement with the experimental\ndata. Let us now consider the limitations of the suggested approach. Its most important shortcoming is the\nabsence of a feedback between the driven polariton modes\nand the exciton reservoir, as long as the latter is introduced using the integral occupation number N , neglecting the actual microscopic distribution of reservoir states.\nAs a result, Eqs. (5)\u2013(9) do not describe, e. g. the establishing of equilibrium between coherent and incoherent\nexciton \"phases\" which would normally take place in a\nreal system; this process implies (i) the reverse transitions from the reservoir into the macro-occupied mode\n(similar to Bose-Einstein condensation) and (ii) dependence of the scattering rates (\u03b3xr and Vr ) on the polariton\ndensity. These shortcomings lead to several visible discrepancies between the measured and calculated data. In\nparticular, the superlinear drop in transmission intensity\nobserved at the back front of exciting pulses, which is evident from comparison of left and right panels of Fig. 8, is\nnot reproduced by the present model. Note as well that\nthe nonlinear scattering rate Vr should depend on the\nenergy of biexciton resonance which mediates the transitions of optically driven polaritons into the reservoir.23,24\nAccordingly, the actual relation between the multistabil(circ)\n(lin)\nity thresholds Wthr and Wthr would depend on the\npump frequency as well as on the frequency detuning between photon and exciton modes.\nAs a result, we expect Eqs. (5)\u2013(9) to be qualitatively\nvalid in the case of resonant excitation of the optically active cavity states. On the other hand, in the cases of comparably large pump wave numbers and/or non-resonant\nexcitation conditions, when a much larger contribution\nof reservoir excitons is expected, the model is likely to\nbecome unsatisfactory.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the present work we have studied the nonequilibrium transitions in a multistable system of cavity polaritons under resonant nanosecond-long excitation. Using the spectrally broadened pulses, we have visualized the temporal correlations between the effective\nresonant energy, intensity, and optical polarization of the\nintra-cavity field which all undergo the strong changes\non reaching the threshold pump power. In the vicinity of\n\nthe threshold, the dynamics of such system is strongly affected by the long-lived exciton reservoir (excited due to\npolariton scattering) which influences both the characteristic times of instability development and output signal\npolarization.\nThe temporal behavior of the intra-cavity field is found\nto be not described in the conventional model based on\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equations written for purely coherent macro-occupied polariton states. Most importantly,\nthe observed phenomena cannot be explained even qualitatively within a model with only the two exciton-exciton\ninteraction constants (V1,2 ) allowed for. To explain the\nexperiments, we have proposed the model for the macrooccupied polariton states coupled with an exciton reservoir. In spite of some limitations, this model provides\na self-consistent description of the observed intra-cavity\nfield dynamics under both pulse and continuous wave excitation conditions.\nAuthors thank M.

In the case of weakly circularly polarized\npump, the jumps in both \u03c3 + and \u03c3 \u2212 modes were found\nto occur simultaneously5,17 in the sense of cw excitation\nconditions with \"infinitesimally slow\" variations of pump\nintensity. In view of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations (1)\u2013(4),\nthis looks like a manifestation of a large repulsion between\npolaritons with opposite pseudospins. At the same time, in\na case when the pump energy is less than a half of biexciton energy, one expects an attractive interaction between\nexcitons with different pseudospins,23 so they cannot provide blueshift for each other; it agrees with the observed\nindications of the negative sign of V2 .\nE.

In such a case, the reservoir induced blueshifts are determined mainly by the ratio between reservoir's decay rate and the coupling constant Vr .\nFor instance, the calculations performed with different \u03b3r\nbut constant \u03b3r /Vr and a sufficiently slow variation of the\npump power lead to exactly same results for the cases of\ncircular and linear pump polarizations. In this connection,\nthe experiments carried out with time resolution using the\nnanosecond long pump pulses (described in Sec. IV) are capable of clarifying the characteristic lifetimes of the reser-\n\n32\n\n33\n\nvoir states, as well as the relation between linear and nonlinear mechanisms of polaritons' scattering into the incoherent exciton reservoir. For instance, the former mechanism is expected to play a role irrespectively of pump polarization, affecting the dynamics of polariton energy and\nthe time moments when the nonequilibrium transitions occur.\nS.
