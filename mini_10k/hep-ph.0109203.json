Typically,\n'low energy' manifestations of quark and lepton substructure would occur via four-fermion\nquark and lepton contact interactions, induced by exchanges of very heavy sub-constituent\nbound states with mass of the order of \u039b [1]. However, this concept is quite general, and\nis adequate to the description of a wide class of quark and lepton cross sections governed\nby exchanges of objects associated to new gauge interactions such as, e.g., heavy neutral\ngauge bosons and leptoquarks, in a regime where such masses are much larger than the\nMandelstam variables of the process.\nThe explicit parameterization of the four-fermion quark and lepton contact interactions\nis, a priori, somewhat arbitrary. In general, it must respect SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry, because the new dynamics are active well-beyond the electroweak scale. Furthermore,\nusually one limits to the lowest dimensional operators, D = 6 being the minimum, and\nneglects higher dimensional operators that are suppressed by higher powers of 1/\u039b2 and\ntherefore are expected to give negligible effects.\nIn this note, we consider the effects of the flavor-diagonal, helicity conserving, eef f\ncontact-interaction effective Lagrangian [2]\n\u0001\n1 X 2\ngeff \u01ebij (\u0113i \u03b3\u03bc ei ) f \u0304j \u03b3 \u03bc fj ,\nLCI =\n(1)\n1 + \u03b4ef i,j\nin the Bhabha scattering process\n\ne+ + e\u2212 \u2192 e+ + e\u2212\n(2)\n\u221a\nat an e+ e\u2212 Linear Collider (LC) with c.m. energy s = 0.5 TeV and polarized electron\nand positron beams. In Eq. (1): i, j = L, R denote left- or right-handed fermion helicities,\nf indicates the fermion species, so that \u03b4ef = 1 for the process (2) under consideration,\nand the CI coupling constants are parameterized in terms of corresponding mass scales as\n2\n\u01ebij = \u03b7ij /\u039b2ij . Actually, one\n\u221a assumes geff = 4\u03c0 to account for the fact that the interaction\nwould become strong at s \u2243 \u039b and, by convention, |\u03b7ij | = \u00b11 or \u03b7ij = 0. This leaves the\nenergy scales \u039bij as free, a priori independent parameters.\nClearly, at s \u226a \u039b2ij , the Lagrangian (1) can only contribute virtual effects, to be soughtfor as very small deviations of the measured observables from the Standard Model (SM)\npredictions. The relative size of such effects is expected to be of order s/\u03b1\u039b2 , with \u03b1\nthe SM coupling (essentially, the fine structure constant) and, therefore, very high collider\nenergies and luminosities are required for this kind of searches. In practice, the constraints\nand the attainable reach on the CI couplings can be numerically assessed by comparing the\ntheoretical deviations with the foreseen experimental uncertainties on the cross sections.\nFor the case of the Bhabha process (2), the effective Lagrangian LCI in Eq. (1) envisages\nthe existence of six individual, and independent, CI models, contributing to individual helicity amplitudes or combinations of them with a priori free, and nonvanishing, coefficients\n1\n\n\f(basically, \u01ebLL , \u01ebRR and \u01ebLR combined with the \u00b1 signs). Correspondingly, in principle the\nmost general, and model-independent, analysis of the data must account for the situation\nwhere all four-fermion effective couplings defined in Eq. (1) are simultaneously allowed in\nthe expression for the cross section. Potentially, the different CI couplings may interfere\nand substantially weaken the bounds. Indeed, although the different helicity amplitudes\nby themselves do not interfere, the deviations from the SM could be positive for one helicity amplitude and negative for another, so that accidental cancellation might occur in the\nsought-for deviations from the SM predictions for the relevant observables.\nThe simplest attitude is to assume non-zero values for only one of the couplings (or one\nspecific combination of them) at a time, with all others zero, and this leads to tests of the\nspecific models mentioned above. Also, in many cases, global analyses combining data from\ndifferent experiments relevant to the considered type of coupling are performed. Current\nlower bounds on the corresponding \u039b's obtained along this line from recent analyses of\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 f \u0304f at LEP, that include Bhabha scattering, are in the range 8-20 TeV and are\nfound to substantially depend on the considered one-parameter scenario [3, 4]. Examples\nof results for the eef f couplings for the different fermion species in (1), from analyses of\ndifferent kinds of processes and experiments, can be found, e.g., in Refs. [5\u20139].\nIt should be highly desirable to apply a more general (and model-independent) approach to the analysis of the experimental data, that allows to simultaneously include all\nterms of Eq. (1) as independent, non vanishing free parameters, and yet to derive separate\nconstraints (or exclusion regions) on the values of the CI coupling constants, free from\npotential weakening due to accidental cancellations.\nSuch an analysis is feasible with initial beam longitudinal polarization, a possibility\nenvisaged at the LC [10]. This allows to extract the individual helicity cross sections\nfrom suitable combinations of measurable polarized cross sections and, consequently, to\ndisentangle the constraints on the corresponding CI constants \u01ebij , see,e.g., Refs. [11\u201318].\nIn what follows, we wish to complement the model-independent analysis of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 f \u0304f\nwith f 6= e, t given in Refs. [17, 18], with a discussion of the role of the polarized differential\ncross sections measurable at the LC in the derivation of model-independent bounds on the\nthree independent four-electron contact interactions relevant to the Bhabha process (2).1\nSpecifically, in Sect. 2 we introduce the observables being considered, and in Sect. 3 we\npresent a numerical analysis and the assessment of the attainable reach on the CI couplings,\nresulting from a \u03c72 procedure that accounts for the expected experimental uncertainties\n(statistical and systematical ones). Finally, Sect. 4 contains a comparison with the results\npreviously obtained for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and some conclusive remarks.\n\n2\n\nPolarized observables\n\nWith P \u2212 and P + the longitudinal polarization of the electron and positron beams, respectively, and \u03b8 the angle between the incoming and the outgoing electrons in the c.m. frame,\nNotice that, in general, for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 f \u0304f with f 6= e there are four independent CI couplings, apart\nfrom the \u00b1 possibility, so that in the present case of process (2) there is one free parameter less.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fthe differential cross section of process (2) at lowest order, including \u03b3 and Z exchanges\nboth in the s and t channels and the contact interaction (1), can be written in the following\nform [11, 12, 15]:\nd\u03c3(P \u2212 , P + )\nd\u03c31\nd\u03c32\nd\u03c3P\n= (1 \u2212 P \u2212 P + )\n+ (1 + P \u2212 P + )\n+ (P + \u2212 P \u2212 )\n.\nd cos \u03b8\nd cos \u03b8\nd cos \u03b8\nd cos \u03b8\n\n(3)\n\nIn Eq.

As one can\nsee from Eqs.(4) and (5), \u03c32 depends on only one contact interaction parameter (\u01ebLR ),\n\u03c3P is two-parameter dependent (\u01ebRR and \u01ebLL ), and \u03c31 depends on all three parameters.\nTherefore, the derivation of the model-independent constraints on the CI couplings requires\nthe combination of all polarized observables of Eq. (6). In this regard, to emphasize the role\nof polarization, one can observe from Eqs. (3)-(5) that, in the unpolarized case P1 = P2 = 0\nwhere only \u03c31 and \u03c32 appear, the interference of the \u01ebLR term with the SM amplitude in A0\nand A\u2212 has opposite signs, leading to a partial cancellation for \u2212t \u223c s. Consequently, as\nanticipated in Sect. 1, one expects the unpolarized cross section to have reduced sensitivity\nto \u01ebLR . Conversely, \u01ebLR is directly accessible from d\u03c32 , via polarized cross sections as in\nEq. (7). Also, considering that numerically gL2 \u223c\n= gR2 , the parameters \u01ebLL and \u01ebRR contribute\nto the unpolarized cross section through A+ with equal coefficients, so that, in general,\nonly correlations of the form |\u01ebLL + \u01ebRR | < const, and not finite allowed regions, could be\nderived in this case.\nTo make contact to the experiment we take P1 = 0.8 and P2 = 0.6, and impose a cut\nin the forward and backward directions. Specifically, we consider the cut angular range\n| cos \u03b8| < 0.9 and divide it into nine equal-size bins of width \u2206z = 0.2 (z \u2261 cos \u03b8). We also\nintroduce the experimental efficiency, \u01eb, for detecting the final e+ e\u2212 pair and, according to\nthe LEP2 experience, \u01eb = 0.9 is assumed.\nWe then define the four, directly measurable, event rates integrated over each bin:\nN++ ,\n\nN\u2212\u2212 ,\n\nN+\u2212 ,\n\nN\u2212+ ,\n\n(8)\n\nand (\u03b1\u03b2 = ++, etc.):\nbin\nN\u03b1\u03b2\n\n1\n= Lint \u01eb\n4\n\nZ\n\n(d\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 /dz)dz.\n\n(9)\n\nbin\n\nIn Eq. (9), Lint is the time-integrated luminosity, which is assumed to be equally divided among the four combinations of electron and positron beams polarization defined in\nEqs. (6).\n\u221a\nbin\nbin\nIn Fig. 1, the bin-integrated angular distributions of N++\nand N+\u2212\nin the SM at s =\n500 GeV and Lint = 50 fb\u22121 are presented as histograms. Here, the SM cross sections have\n4\n\n\fN\n\nbeen evaluated by means of the effective Born approximation [19, 20]. The typical forward\npeak, dominated by the t-channel photon pole, dramatically shows up, and determines a\nreally large statistics available in the region of small t. The cos \u03b8 distributions for the other\npolarization configurations in (6) are similar and, therefore, we do not represent them here.\n\ncos\n\nbin\nbin\nFigure 1: Bin-integrated\n\u221a angular distributions of N+\u2212\u22121(solid line) and N++ (dashed line),\nEq.(9), in the SM at s = 500 GeV and Lint = 50 fb .\n\nThe next step is to define the relative deviations of the cross sections \u03c31 , \u03c32 and \u03c3P\nfrom the SM predictions, due to the contact interaction. In general, for such deviations,\nwe use the notation:\n\u2206O =\n\nO(SM + CI) \u2212 O(SM)\n,\nO(SM)\n\n(10)\n\nTo get an illustration of the effect of the contact interactions on the observables (7) under\nconsideration, we show in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b the angular distributions of the relative\ndeviations of d\u03c31 and d\u03c32 , taking as examples the values of Lint and \u039bij indicated in the\ncaptions. The SM predictions are evaluated in the same, effective Born, approximation\nas in Fig. 1. The deviations are then compared to the expected statistical uncertainties,\nrepresented by the vertical bars. Fig. 2a shows that d\u03c31 is sensitive to contact interactions\nin the forward region, where the ratio of the 'signal' to the statistical\nuncertainty increases.\n\u221a\nAlso, it indicates that, for the chosen values of the c.m. energy s and Lint , the reach on \u039bij\nwill be substantially larger than 30 TeV. Conversely, Fig. 2b shows that the sensitivity of\nd\u03c32 is almost independent on the chosen kinematical range in cos \u03b8, leading to a really high\nsensitivity of this observable to \u01ebLR , and to corresponding lower bounds on \u039bLR potentially\n5\n\n\flarger than 50 TeV. We now proceed to the analysis of the bounds on the contact interaction\ncouplings.\n(b)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\ncos\n\ncos\n\nFigure 2: The angular distributions for the relative deviations \u2206\u03c31 (a) at \u039bRR =30 TeV\n(solid line) and 50 TeV (dashed line), and for \u2206\u03c32 (b) at \u039bLR =40 TeV (dashed line),\n50 TeV (solid line), 70 TeV (dot-dashed line). The curves above (below) the horizontal\nline correspond to negative (positive) interference between contact interaction and SM\namplitude. The error bars show the expected statistical error at Lint = 50 fb\u22121 .\n\n3\n\nNumerical analysis and constraints on CI couplings\n\nTo assess the sensitivity to the compositeness scale we assume the data to be well described\nby the SM predictions (\u01ebij = 0), i.e., that no deviation is observed within the foreseen\nexperimental accuracy, and perform a \u03c72 analysis of the cos \u03b8 angular distribution. For\neach of the observable cross sections, the \u03c72 distribution is defined as the sum over the\nabove mentioned nine equal-size cos \u03b8 bins:\n2\n\n\u03c7 (O) =\n\nX \u0012 \u2206Obin \u00132\nbins\n\n\u03b4Obin\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nR\nwhere O = \u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c3P and \u03c3 bin \u2261 bin (d\u03c3/dz)dz. In Eq. (11), \u2206O represents the deviation\nfrom the SM prediction, \u2206O = O(SM + CI) \u2212 O(SM), which can be easily expressed\nin terms of the CI couplings by using Eqs. (5), and \u03b4O is the expected experimental\nuncertainty, that combines the statistical and the systematic ones.\nIn the following analysis, the theoretical expectations for the polarized cross sections\nare evaluated by using the program TOPAZ0 [21, 22], adapted to the present discussion,\nwith mtop = 175 GeV and MH = 120 GeV. For electron-positron final states, a cut on\n6\n\n\fthe acollinearity angle between electron and positron, \u03b8acol < 10\u25e6 , is applied to select\nnon-radiative events.\nConcerning the numerical inputs and assumptions used in the estimate of \u03b4O, to assess the role of statistics we vary Lint from 50 to 500 fb\u22121 (a quarter of the total running time for each polarization configuration). As for the systematic uncertainty, we take\n\u03b4Lint /Lint = 0.5%, \u03b4\u01eb/\u01eb = 0.5% and, regarding the electron and positron degrees of polarization, \u03b4P1 /P1 = \u03b4P2 /P2 = 0.5 %.\nFor\n\u221a example, in the case of \u03c32 , the deviation from the SM prediction, largely dominated\nfor s << \u039bLR by the interference term, can be represented as:\nZ\nd cos \u03b8\nbin\nbin\nbin\n(1 + gR gL \u03c7Z (t)) ,\n(12)\n\u2206\u03c32 \u2261 \u03c32 (SM + CI) \u2212 \u03c32 (SM) \u2243 2\u03c0\u03b1s\u01ebLR\nt\nbin\nand, combining uncertainties in quadrature, the uncertainty on \u03c32 , indirectly determined\nvia the measured \u03c3++ , \u03c3\u2212\u2212 , \u03c3+\u2212 and \u03c3\u2212+ as in Eq.

We take the values \u03c72CL =3.84\nand 5.99 for 95% C.L. for a one- and a two-parameter fit, respectively.\nWe begin with the presentation of the numerical results for \u01ebLR . In this case, the relevant\ncross section \u03c32 depends on \u01ebLR only, see Eqs. (4) and (5) and, therefore, the constraints\non that parameter are determined from a one-parameter fit. The model-independent,\ndiscovery reach expected at the LC for the corresponding mass scale \u039bLR is represented,\nas a function of the integrated luminosity Lint , by the solid line in Fig. 3. As expected,\nthe highest luminosity determines the strongest constraints on the CI couplings.2 Fig. 3\ndramatically shows the really high sensitivity of \u03c32 , such that the discovery limits on\n\u039bLR are the highest, compared to the \u039bRR and \u039bLL cases, and can be as large as 110 up\nto 170 times the total c.m. energy. Actually, the \u039bLR limits are large enough that the\napproximation used in Eq. (12) is good for all values of t, so that the derived limits are\nindependent of the sign of the \u01ebLR .\n2\n\nSuch increase with luminosity is somewhat slower than expected from the scaling law \u039b \u223c (sLint )\nas the effect of the systematic uncertainties competing with the statistical ones.\n\n7\n\n1/4\n\n,\n\n\f(TeV)\n\nLint(fb-1)\n\nFigure 3: Reach in \u039bij at 95% C.L. vs. integrated luminosity\nLint obtained from the\n\u221a\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nmodel-independent analysis for e + e \u2192 e + e at s = 0.5 TeV, |P \u2212 | = 0.8 and\n|P + | = 0.6, \u039bLR (solid line), \u039bLL (dashed line), \u039bRR (dot-dash line).\nSince \u03c3P simultaneously depends on the two independent CI couplings \u01ebRR and \u01ebLL ,\na two-parameter analysis is needed in this case. Here, the terms quadratic in \u01ebLL and\n\u01ebRR largely cancel leaving the remaining interference to dominate the relevant deviations\nfrom the SM, and consequently the resulting constraint has the form of a straight band,\nas depicted in Fig. 4a. Indeed, such a band represents a correlation between the two\nparameters, rather than a bound around the SM value \u01ebLL = \u01ebRR = 0.\nIn order to get a restricted allowed region around zero, one can combine the above\nmentioned band with the exclusion region obtained from \u03c31 . However, since the latter\ndepends on all three contact interaction parameters, see Eqs. (4) and (5), to set constraints\nin the (\u01ebRR , \u01ebLL ) plane requires the combination of the \u03c31 -bounds with the limits on \u01ebLR\nderived above from \u03c32 . The bound in the (\u01ebRR , \u01ebLL ) resulting from this procedure is shown\nin Fig. 4a and, finally, the shaded ellipse determined by the combination with the band\ndetermined by \u03c3P represents the restricted allowed region around the SM point \u01ebij = 0.\nWith reference to Eq. (11), for the \u03c72 analysis this amounts to the consideration of the\ncombined \u03c72 (\u03c31 ) + \u03c72 (\u03c3P ). Fig. 4b is essentially a magnification of the shaded region of\nFig. 4a, and represents the model-independent limits on \u01ebLL and \u01ebRR attainable at the\nconsidered LC, for two possible values of the integrated luminosity. These bounds are\ntranslated into the model-independent reach on the mass scale parameters \u039bLL and \u039bRR ,\nrepresented as a function of luminosity in Fig. 3. The fact that such bounds are substantially lower than those for \u039bLR reflects that a combined two-parameter \u03c72 analysis must be\nused. In this regard, the calculation presented here indicates that not only polarization,\n8\n\n\fbut also combinations of measurements of polarized observables are necessary to obtain\nmodel-independent bounds on the CI couplings.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\np\n\nLL(TeV\n\n-2\n\n)\n\n-2\nLL(TeV )\n\n1\n\nRR(TeV\n\n-2\n\nRR(TeV\n\n)\n\n-2\n\n)\n\nFigure 4: (a) Allowed areas at 95% C.L. on electron\nin\n\u221a contact interaction parameters\n\u22121\nthe planes (\u01ebRR , \u01ebLL ), obtained from \u03c31 and \u03c3P at s = 500 GeV and Lint\n\u221a = 50 fb (a);\n(b) Combined allowed regions at 95% C.L. obtained from \u03c31 and \u03c3P at s = 500 GeV,\nLint = 50 fb\u22121 (outer ellipse) and 500 fb\u22121 (inner ellipse).\nThe crosses in Fig. 4b represent the model-dependent constraints obtainable by taking\nonly one non-zero parameter at a time, either \u01ebLL or \u01ebRR , instead of the two simultaneously\nnon-zero and independent as in the analysis discussed above. Similar to the inner and\nouter ellipses, the shorter and longer arms of the crosses refer to integrated luminosity\nLint = 50 fb\u22121 and 500 fb\u22121 , respectively. One can note from Fig. 4b that the 'singleparameter' constraints on the individual CI parameters \u01ebRR and \u01ebLL are numerically more\nstringent, as compared to the model-independent ones. Essentially, this is a reflection of\nthe smaller value of the critical \u03c72 , \u03c72CL = 3.84 corresponding to 95% C.L. with a oneparameter fit.\n\n4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn the previous sections we have derived limits on the contact interactions relevant to\nBhabha scattering by a model-independent analysis that allows to simultaneously account\nfor all independent couplings as non-vanishing free parameters. The results for the lower\nbounds on the corresponding mass scales \u039b range, depending on the luminosity, from\nessentially 38 to 50 TeV for the LL and RR cases, and from 54 to 84 TeV for the LR case.\nThe comparison with the numerical results relevant to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel, derived\nfrom a similar analysis [18], is shown in Table 1.\nThe table shows that for \u039bLL and \u039bRR the restrictions from e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192\ne+ e\u2212 are qualitatively comparable.

In this regard, this\nis the consequence of the initial beams longitudinal polarization that allows, by measuring\nsuitable combinations of polarized cross sections, to directly disentangle the coupling \u01ebLR .\nIndeed, as previously observed, in general without polarization only correlations among\ncouplings, rather that finite allowed regions, could be derived or, alternatively, a oneparameter analysis testing individual models can be performed.\nAs an example of application of the obtained results to a possible source of contact\ninteractions, we may consider the sneutrino parameters (mass m\u03bd\u0303 and Yukawa coupling\n\u03bb) envisaged by supersymmetric theories with R-parity breaking. In this case, sneutrino\nexchange affects only those helicity amplitudes with non-diagonal chiral indices, so that\n\u039bLR is the relevant mass scale [23, 24]. Qualitatively, without entering into\n\u221a a detailed and\nmore complex analysis, one can expect typical bounds on m\u03bd\u0303 /\u03bb \u223c \u039bLR / 8\u03c0 \u2243 11 to 17\nTeV corresponding to \u039bLR \u2248 54 TeV and 84 TeV (Fig. 3) at Lint = 50 fb\u22121 and 500 fb\u22121 ,\nrespectively.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been partially supported by MURST (Italian Ministry of University,\nScientific Research and Technology) and by funds of the University of Trieste.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
