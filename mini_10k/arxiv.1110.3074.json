Self-avoiding walks\nhave turned out to be a very interesting object, leading to rich mathematical theories and\nchallenging questions; see [MS93, BDCGS12].\nDenote by cn the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on the hypercubic lattice (Zd\nwith edges between nearest neighbors) started from some fixed vertex, e.g. the origin.\nElementary bounds on cn (for instance dn \u2264 cn \u2264 2d(2d \u2212 1)n\u22121 ) guarantee that cn grows\nexponentially fast. Since an (n + m)-step self-avoiding walk can be uniquely cut into an\nn-step self-avoiding walk and a parallel translation of an m-step self-avoiding walk, we\ninfer that cn+m \u2264 cn cm , from which it follows that there exists \u03bc = \u03bc(d) \u2208 (0, +\u221e) such\n1/n\nthat \u03bc \u2236= limn\u2192\u221e cn . The positive real number \u03bc is called the connective constant of the\nlattice. The connective constant can be approximated in a number of ways, yet no closed\nformula exists\ngeneral. In the case of the hexagonal lattice, it was recently proved to\n\u221a in \u221a\nbe equal to 2 + 2 in [DCS12].\nAs it stands, the model has a strong combinatorial flavor. A more geometric variation\nwas suggested by Lawler, Schramm and Werner [LSW04]. Let us describe their construction now - they were interested in the two-dimensional case, but here we will not make\nthis restriction. Let \u03a9 be a simply connected domain in Rd with two points a, b on the\nboundary. For \u03b4 > 0, let \u03a9\u03b4 be the largest connected component of \u03a9 \u2229 \u03b4Zd and let a\u03b4 , b\u03b4\nbe the two sites of \u03a9\u03b4 closest to a and b respectively. We think of (\u03a9\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ) as being an\napproximation of (\u03a9, a, b). See figure 1.\nLet x > 0. On (\u03a9\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ), define a probability measure on the finite set of self-avoiding\nwalks in \u03a9\u03b4 from a\u03b4 to b\u03b4 by the formula\nP(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) (\u03b3) =\n\nx\u2223\u03b3\u2223\nZ(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (x)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2223\u03b3\u2223 is the length of \u03b3 (i.e. the number of edges), and Z(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (x) is a normalizing\nfactor. A random curve \u03b3\u03b4 with law P(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) is called the self-avoiding walk with\nparameter x in (\u03a9\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ). The sum Z(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (x) = \u2211\u03b3 x\u2223\u03b3\u2223 (with the sum taken over\nall self-avoiding walks in \u03a9\u03b4 from a\u03b4 to b\u03b4 ) is sometimes called the partition function (or\ngenerating function) of self-avoiding walks from a\u03b4 to b\u03b4 in the domain \u03a9\u03b4 .\nWhen the domain (\u03a9, a, b) is fixed, we are interested in the scaling limit of the family\n(\u03b3\u03b4 ), i.e. its geometric behavior when \u03b4 goes to 0. The qualitative behavior is expected\n1\n\n\fb\u03b4\n\n\u03a9\u03b4\n\na\u03b4\n\nFigure 1: A domain \u03a9 with two points a and b on the boundary (circles) and the graph\n\u03a9\u03b4 . The points a\u03b4 and b\u03b4 are depicted by squares. An example of a possible walk from a\u03b4\nto b\u03b4 is presented. Note that there is a finite number of them.\nto differ drastically depending on the value of x. A phase transition occurs at the value\nxc = 1/\u03bc, where \u03bc is the connective constant:\nWhen x < 1/\u03bc: \u03b3\u03b4 converges to a deterministic curve corresponding to the geodesic\nbetween a and b in \u03a9 (assuming it is unique - otherwise some adaptations\nneed to\n\u221a\nbe done). When rescaled, \u03b3\u03b4 should have Gaussian fluctuation of order \u03b4 around the\ngeodesic. The strong results of Ioffe [Iof98] on the unrestricted self-avoiding walk would\nbe a central tool for proving such a statement, though we are not aware of a reference for\nthe details.\nWhen x = 1/\u03bc: \u03b3\u03b4 should converge to a random simple curve. In dimensions four\nand higher, the limit is believed to be a Brownian excursion from a to b in the domain\n\u03a9. This is heuristically related to a number of rigorously proved results: in dimensions\nfive and above to the work of Brydges and Spencer [BS85] and Hara and Slade [HS91,\nHS92] who showed that unrestricted self-avoiding walk converges to Brownian motion (see\nalso the book [MS93]). Dimension four, the so-called upper critical dimension, is much\nharder, but recently some impressive results have been achieved using a supersymmetric\nrenormalization group approach. These results are limited to continuous time weakly\nself-avoiding walk, see [BIS09, BS, BDS] and references within.\nIn dimension two, the scaling limit is conjectured to be the Schramm-L\u00f6wner Evolution\nof parameter 8/3, and in fact it was pointed out that this is true if the scaling limit exists\nas a continuous curve and is conformally invariant [LSW04].\nFinally, dimension three remains a mystery, and there is no clear candidate for the\nscaling limit of self-avoiding walk.\n2\n\n\fWhen x > 1/\u03bc: \u03b3\u03b4 is expected to become space-filling in the following sense: for any\nopen set U \u2282 \u03a9,\nP(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) [\u03b3\u03b4 \u2229 U = \u2205] \u2192 0\nwhen \u03b4 goes to 0. On the one hand, let us mention that it is not clear in which sense (if\nany) (\u03b3\u03b4 ) has a scaling limit when d \u2265 3. On the other hand, the scaling limit is predicted\n[Smi06, Conjecture 3] to exist in dimension two (in the case of the hexagonal lattice at\nleast). It should be the Schramm-L\u00f6wner Evolution of parameter 8, which is conformally\ninvariant.\nOne cannot hope that \u03b3\u03b4 would be space-filling in the strictest possible sense, namely\nthat every vertex is visited. Nevertheless, one can quantify the size of the biggest hole\nnot visited by the walk. The subject of this paper is the proof of a result which quantifies\nhow \u03b3\u03b4 becomes space filling. Here is a precise formulation.\nTheorem 1. Let D be the unit disk and let a and b be two points on its boundary. For\nevery x > 1/\u03bc, there exist \u03be = \u03be(x) > 0 and c = c(x) > 0 such that\nP(D\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) [there exists a component of D\u03b4 \u2216 \u0393\u03be\u03b4 with cardinality > c log(1/\u03b4)] \u2192 0\nwhen \u03b4 \u2192 0, where \u0393\u03be\u03b4 is the set of sites in D\u03b4 at graph distance less than \u03be from \u03b3\u03b4 .\nThe theorem is stated for the unit disk to avoid various connectivity problems. Indeed, assume that at some given scale \u03b4 our\ndomain \u03a9 has a part which is connected by a \"bridge\" of width\n\u03b4. Then the graph \u03a9\u03b4 will have a large part connected by a single\nedge, which does not leave the self-avoiding walk enough space to\nenter and exit. Thus an analog of theorem 1 will not hold for this \u03a9. It is not difficult to\nconstruct a single domain \u03a9 with such \"mushrooms\" in many scales. See the figure on the\nright. In order to solve this issue, one can start from an arbitrary domain and expand it\nmicroscopically. This gives rise to the following formulation:\nTheorem 2. Let (\u03a9, a, b) be a bounded domain with two points on the boundary. For\nevery x > 1/\u03bc, there exist \u03be = \u03be(x) > 0 and c = c(x) > 0 such that\nP((\u03a9+B(\u03be\u03b4))\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) [\u2203 a component of (\u03a9 + B(\u03be\u03b4))\u03b4 \u2216 \u0393\u03be\u03b4 larger than c log(1/\u03b4)] \u2192 0\nwhen \u03b4 \u2192 0, where \u0393\u03be\u03b4 is the set of sites in (\u03a9 + B(\u03be\u03b4))\u03b4 at graph distance less than \u03be from\n\u03b3\u03b4 .\nHere \u03a9 + B(\u03be\u03b4) is \u03a9 expanded by \u03be\u03b4 i.e.\n\u03a9 + B(\u03be\u03b4) = {z \u2236 dist(z, \u03a9) < \u03be\u03b4}.\nSince \u03be depends only on x, and \u03b4 \u2192 0, this is a microscopic expansion.\n\n3\n\n\f(0, 2m + 1)\n\n(2m + 1, 2m + 1)\n\n(0, 0)\n\n(2m + 1, 0)\n\nFigure 2: by concatenating four walks in squares of size m (plus four edges), one obtains\nan element of Pm , i.e. a loop in the square of size 2m + 1 going through the middle of the\nsides.\nThe strategy of the proof is fairly natural. We first prove that in the supercritical\nphase, one can construct a lot (compared to their energy) of self-avoiding polygons in a\nprescribed box. Then, we show that the self-avoiding walk cannot leave holes that are\ntoo large, since adding polygons in the big holes to the self-avoiding walk would increase\nthe entropy drastically while decreasing the energy in a reasonable way. In particular, a\ncomparison energy/entropy shows that self-avoiding walks leaving big holes are unlikely.\nWe present the proof only in the case d = 2, even though the reasoning carries over to\nall dimensions without difficulty (see Remark 8). One can also extend the result to other\nlattices with sufficient symmetry in a straightforward way (for instance to the hexagonal\nlattice).\n\n2\n\nSelf-avoiding polygons in a square\n\nIn this section, we think of a walk as being indexed by (discrete) time t from 0 to n.\nFor m > 0, let Pm be the set of self-avoiding polygons in [0, 2m + 1]2 that touch the\nmiddle of every face of the square: more formally, such that the edges [(m, 0), (m + 1, 0)],\n[(2m+1, m), (2m+1, m+1)], [(m, 2m+1), (m+1, 2m+1)] and [(0, m), (0, m+1)] belong to\nthe polygon, see figure 2. For x > 0, let Zm (x) be the partition function (with parameter\nx) of Pm , i.e.\nZm (x) = \u2211 x\u2223\u03b3\u2223 .\n\u03b3\u2208Pm\n\nProposition 3.

One can construct a squared walk in\na rectangle by reflecting non-bold walks and then concatenating all the walks together.\nIt is classical that the number of self-avoiding walks with certain constraints grows\nat the same exponential rate as the number of self-avoiding walks without constraints\n(we will show it in our context in the proof of Lemma 5 below). For instance, let x(v)\nand y(v) be the first and the second coordinates of the vertex v. The number bn of\nself-avoiding bridges of length n, meaning self-avoiding walks \u03b3 of length n such that\ny(\u03b30 ) = mint\u2208[0,n] y(\u03b3t ) and y(\u03b3n ) = maxt\u2208[0,n] y(\u03b3t ), satisfies\ne\u2212c\n\n\u221a\nn n\n\n\u03bc \u2264 bn \u2264 \u03bc n\n\n(2)\n\nfor every n [HW62] (see also [MS93] for a modern exposition).

For an integer A \u2265 1, let PD (A) denote the\nnumber of ways of writing A = A1 + \u22ef + Ak with A1 > \u22ef > Ak \u2265 1, for any k \u2265 1.

A\nsquared walk (of span k) is a self-avoiding walk such that \u03b30 = (0, 0), \u03b3n = (k, k) and\n\u03b3 \u2282 [0, k]2 .\nLemma 5.

Let \u03a3n be the set of n-step self-avoiding walks for which there\nexists (k, l) such that \u03b30 = (0, 0), \u03b3n = (k, l) and \u03b3 \u2282 [0, k] \u00d7 [0, l]. We construct a map\nfrom \u039bn to \u03a3n .\nFix \u03b3 \u2208 \u039bn and denote by m1 the first time at which x(\u03b3m1 ) = mint\u2208[0,n] x(\u03b3t ), see figure\n3. Then, define n1 to be the first time at which x(\u03b3n1 ) = maxt\u2208[0,m1 ] x(\u03b3t ). One can then\ndefine recursively mk , nk , by the formulae\nmk = min{r \u2264 nk\u22121 \u2236 x(\u03b3r ) = min x(\u03b3t )}\nt\u2208[0,nk\u22121 ]\n\nnk = min{r \u2264 mk \u2236 x(\u03b3r ) = max x(\u03b3t )}\nt\u2208[0,mk ]\n\nWe stop the recursion the first time mk or nk equals 0. For convenience, if the first\ntime is nk , we add a further step mk+1 = 0. We are then in possession of a sequence of\nintegers m1 > n1 > m2 > \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 > mr \u2265 nr \u2265 0 and a sequence of walks \u03b32r\u22121 = \u03b3[n1 , m1 ],\n\u03b32r\u22122 = \u03b3[m2 , n1 ], . . . , \u03b31 = \u03b3[0, mr ]. Note that the width of the walks \u03b3i is strictly\nincreasing (see figure 3 again).\nSimilarly, let p1 be the last time at which x(\u03b3p1 ) = maxt\u2208[m1 ,n] x(\u03b3t ) and q1 the last\ntime at which x(\u03b3q1 ) = mint\u2208[p1 ,n] x(\u03b3t ). Then define recursively pk and qk by the following\nformula\npk = max{r \u2265 qk\u22121 \u2236 x(\u03b3r ) = max x(\u03b3t )}\nt\u2208[qk\u22121 ,n]\n\nqk = max{r \u2264 pk \u2236 x(\u03b3r ) = min x(\u03b3t )}\nt\u2208[pk ,n]\n\nThis procedure stops eventually and we obtain another sequence of walks \u03b3\u03030 = \u03b3[m1 , p1 ],\n\u03b3\u03031 = \u03b3[p1 , q1 ], etc. This time, the width of the walks is strictly decreasing, see figure 3\none more time.\nFor a walk \u03c9, we set \u03c3(\u03c9) to be its reflexion with respect to the vertical line passing\nthrough its starting point. Let f (\u03b3) be the concatenation of \u03b31 , \u03c3(\u03b32 ), \u03b33 , . . . , \u03c3(\u03b3r ),\n\u03b3\u03030 , \u03c3(\u03b3\u03031 ), \u03b3\u03032 and so on. This walk is contained in the rectangle with corners being its\nendpoints so that f maps \u039bn on \u03a3n .\nIn order to estimate the cardinality of \u03a3n , we remark that each element of \u03a3n has a\nlimited number of possible preimages under f . More precisely, the map which gives f (\u03b3)\nand the widths of the walks (\u03b3i ) and (\u03b3\u0303i ) is one-to-one (the reverse procedure is easy to\nidentify). The number of possible widths for \u03b3i and \u03b3\u0303i is the number of pairs\nof decreasing\n\u221a\nn\nc\nsequences partitioning an integer l \u2264 n. This number is bounded by e\u221a (Theorem 4).\nTherefore, the number of possible preimages\nunder\u221a f is bounded by ec n . Using (2), the\n\u221a\n\u2212c\nn\ncardinality of \u03a3n is thus larger than e\nbn \u2265 e\u22122c n \u03bcn .\nSo far n was not restricted to be even.\nStep 2: Squares. We have bounded from below the number of n-step self-avoiding\nwalks 'contained in a rectangle'. We now extend this bound to the case of squares. There\nexist k, l \u2264 n such\nthat the number of elements of \u03a3n with (k, l) as an ending point is\n\u221a\nlarger than e\u22122c n \u03bcn /n2 . By taking two arbitrary walks of \u03a3n ending at (k, l), one can\n6\n\n\f(k + l, k + l)\n\u03b32\n\n(l, k)\n\u03c3ei\u03c0/4 R (\u03b31 )\nei\u03c0/4 R\n\n(k, l)\n\n\u03b31\n\nFigure 4: This figure depicts the passage of two walks in the rectangle [0, k] \u00d7 [0, l] to a\nwalk in the square [0, k + l]2 .\nconstruct a 2n-step self-avoiding walk with \u03b30 = (0, 0) and \u03b32n = (k + l, k + l) contained\nin [0, k + l]2 by reflecting orthogonally to ei\u03c0/4 R the\u221a first walk, and then concatenating\nthe two, see figure 4. We deduce that a2n \u2265 \u03bc2n e\u22124c n /n4 . This shows the lemma for n\nsufficiently large, and one can increase c if necessary to handle all even n.\nProof of Proposition 3. Squared walks with length n were defined as walks between\ncorners of some m\u00d7m square, but m was not fixed. Fix now m to be such that the number\nof such walks is maximized (and then it is at least an /n where an is the total number\nof squared walks). It is interesting to remark that finding the maximal m as an explicit\nfunction of n, even asymptotically, seems difficult, probably no easier than the SLE8/3\nconjecture. But we do not need to know its value. From any quadruplet (\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 , \u03b34 )\nof such squared self-avoiding walks, one can construct a self-avoiding polygon of Pm as\nfollows (see figure 2):\n\u2022 translate \u03b31 and \u03b33 by (m + 1, 0) and (0, m + 1) respectively,\n\u2022 rotate \u03b32 and \u03b34 by an angle \u03c0/2, and then translate them by (m, 0) and (2m +\n1, m + 1) respectively,\n\u2022 add the four edges [(m, 0), (m + 1, 0)], [(2m + 1, m), (2m + 1, m + 1)], [(m, 2m +\n1), (m + 1, 2m + 1)] and [(0, m), (0, m + 1)].\nSince each walk is contained in a square, one can easily check that we obtain a (4n+4)step polygon in Pm . Using Lemma 5, we obtain\nZm (x) \u2265 x\n\n4n+4\n\nxn+1 \u03bcn e\u2212c\nan 4\n( ) \u2265(\nn\nn\n7\n\n\u221a\nn\n\n4\n\n) .\n\n\f\u03a9\u03b4\ncardinal edges in EC F\n\nb\u03b4\n\nconnected family F of boxes in F(\u03a9\u03b4 , 2)\n\na\u03b4\n\nFigure 5: A discrete domain with a connected component of adjacent boxes of size 5\n(m = 2). Edges of EF lie in the gray area.\nWhen n goes to infinity, the right-hand side goes to infinity and the claim follows readily.\n\n3\n\nProof of the main results\n\nThe strategy is the following. We first show that for some hole (namely it will be a\nconnected union of boxes of some size m), the probability that the self-avoiding walk gets\nclose to it without intersecting it can be estimated in terms of Zm (x). This claim is the\ncore of the argument, and is presented in Proposition 7. Next, we show that choosing\nm large enough (or equivalently Zm (x) large enough), the probability to avoid some\nconnected union of k boxes decays exponentially fast in k, thus implying Theorem 1.\nLet m > 0. A cardinal edge of a (square) box B of side length 2m + 1 is an edge of\nthe lattice in the middle of one of the sides of B. For m \u2208 N, two boxes B and B \u2032 of side\nlength 2m + 1 are said to be adjacent if they are disjoint and each has a cardinal edge,\n[xy] and [zt] respectively, such that x \u223c z, y \u223c t (see figure 5). A family F of boxes is\ncalled connected if every two boxes can be connected by a path of adjacent boxes in F .\nTo simplify the picture, we will assume that all our boxes have their lower left corner\nin (2m + 2)\u03b4Z2 . When \u03a9\u03b4 is fixed, such boxes included in \u03a9\u03b4 are called m-boxes and the\nset of m-boxes is denoted by F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m).\nLet us return to the issue of domain regularity discussed after Theorem 1. With the\ndefinitions above we can now explain that, in fact, our only requirement from the domain\nis that the family of all boxes in F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m) is connected. Let us state this formally. The\nset \u0393\u03be\u03b4 is as in Theorem 1.\n\n8\n\n\fTheorem 6. For every x > 1/\u03bc, there exists m = m(x) and c(x) > 0 such that for every\ndomain \u03a9 and every \u03b4 > 0 such that F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m) is connected, one has, for every a and b\nin the boundary of \u03a9, and every \u03bb > 0,\nP\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x (\u2203 a component of \u03a9\u03b4 \u2216 \u03936m\nof size > \u03bb) \u2264\n\u03b4\n\nC(x, \u03a9) \u2212c(x)\u03bb\ne\n.\n\u03b42\n\nProof of Theorem 1 given Theorem 6. Here our domain is D. Clearly, the family\nof all boxes in D\u03b4 is connected (it is an interval in every row and every column), hence\nTheorem 6 applies. Taking \u03bb = C1 log(1/\u03b4) for C1 sufficiently large gives the result.\nProof of Theorem 2 given Theorem 6.\nAgain, all we have to show is that the\nfamily of boxes in (\u03a9 + B(\u03be\u03b4))\u03b4 is connected for \u03be sufficiently large. Taking \u03be = 6m we see\nthat every box in \u03a9 + B(6m\u03b4) can be connected to a box in \u03a9, and any two boxes in \u03a9\ncan be connected by taking a path \u03b3 in \u03a9 between them (here is where we use that \u03a9 is\nconnected) and checking that \u03b3 + B(6m\u03b4) contains a path of connected boxes.\nHence we need to prove Theorem 6. Let \u03b4 > 0. For F \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m), let VF be the set\nof vertices in boxes of F , and let EF be the set of edges with both end-points in VF . For\ntwo subsets A and B of the vertices of \u03a9\u03b4 define the box distance boxdist(A, B) between\nthem as the size of the smallest set of connected boxes containing one box in A and one\nbox in B, minus 1. The boxes do not have to be different, but then the distance is 0 -\nif no such connected set exists, then the distance is \u221e.\nProposition 7. Let (\u03a9, a, b) be a domain with two points on the boundary. Fix \u03b4 > 0 and\nm \u2208 N and assume F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m) is connected. Then there exists C(x, m) < \u221e such that for\nevery F \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m),\nP(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) (boxdist(\u03b3\u03b4 , VF ) = 1) \u2264 C(x, m) Zm (x)\u2212\u2223F \u2223 .\nProof. For F \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m), let E C F be the set of external cardinal edges of F i.e. all\ncardinal edges in boxes of F which have neighbors outside of F . Let SF be the set of\nself-avoiding polygons included in EF visiting all the edges in E C F . Let ZF (x) be the\npartition function of polygons in SF . We have:\nClaim. For F \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , m), ZF (x) \u2265 Zm (x)\u2223F \u2223 .\nProof of the claim. We prove the result by induction on the cardinality of F \u2208\nF (\u03a9\u03b4 , \u03be). If the cardinality of F is 1, ZF (x) = Zm (x) by definition. Consider\nF0 \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , \u03be) and assume the statement true for every F \u2208 F (\u03a9\u03b4 , \u03be) with \u2223F \u2223 < \u2223F0 \u2223.\nThere exists a box B in F0 such that F0 \u2216 {B} is still connected. Therefore, for every\npair (\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 ) \u2208 S{B} \u00d7 SF0 \u2216{B} , one can associate a polygon in SF in a one-to-one fashion.\nIndeed, B is adjacent to a box B \u2032 \u2208 F0 \u2216 {B} so that one of the four cardinal edges (called\n[ab]) of B is adjacent to a cardinal edge [cd] of B \u2032 . Note that [cd] belongs to E C F0 \u2216{B} .\n\n9\n\n\fb\u03b4\ne\n\u03a9\u03b4\n\ne\n\na\u03b4\n\nFigure 6: Two examples of the polygon ` (the small N- and L-shaped loops). It overlaps\nthe curve in one edge exactly, except in the second case, where we have no choice but\noverlapping the walk on two edges.\nThen, by changing the edges [cd] and [ab] of \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 into the edges [ac] and [bd], one\nobtains a polygon in SF . Furthermore, the construction is one-to-one and we deduce\n\u2223F \u2216{B}\u2223\n\nZF0 (x) \u2265 ZF0 \u2216{B} (x)ZB (x) \u2265 Zm 0\n\nZm (x) = Zm (x)\u2223F0 \u2223 .\n\nConsider the set \u0398F of walks not intersecting F yet reaching to a neighboring box. Let\ne be a cardinal edge of a box in F which neighbours a box visited by \u03b3. For each \u03b3 \u2208 \u0398F ,\nconsider a self-avoiding polygon ` = `(\u03b3) (` standing for \"link\") satisfying the following\nthree properties:\n\u2022 it contains e and is included in (\u03a9\u03b4 \u2216 EF ) \u222a {e},\n\u2022 it intersects \u03b3 either at just one edge, or at two adjacent edges only (to intersect\nmeans to intersect along edges),\n\u2022 it has length smaller than 10m + 10 (for simplicity, we will bound the length by\n100m).\nOne can easily check that such a polygon always exists, see figure 6.\nNow, consider the map f that associates to (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ) \u2208 \u0398F \u00d7SF the symmetric difference\n\u03b3 = f (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ) of \u03b31 , `(\u03b31 ) and \u03b32 (symmetric difference here meaning as sets of edges). Note\nthat the object that we obtain is a walk from a\u03b4 to b\u03b4 in \u03a9\u03b4 , which can be verified to be\nself-avoiding by noting that each vertex has degree 0 or 2 and that the set is connected.\nFurther, its length is equal to \u2223\u03b31 \u2223 + \u2223`(\u03b31 )\u2223 + \u2223\u03b32 \u2223 \u2212 4 or \u2223\u03b31 \u2223 + \u2223`(\u03b31 )\u2223 + \u2223\u03b32 \u2223 \u2212 6 (this being due\nto the fact that \u03b31 and `(\u03b31 ) intersect at one or two adjacent edges - each intersection\n10\n\n\freduces the length by 2 edges). Now, given a path \u03b3 there is a limited number of ways\nit may be written as f (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ). Indeed, e can be located by the only two paths that exit\nF , and that gives \u03b32 . Given e, ` has only a limited number of possibilities, say 4100m , and\nonce one knows ` this gives \u03b31 . We can now write\nZ\u0398F (x) \u22c5 ZF (x) = ( \u2211 x\u2223\u03b31 \u2223 ) ( \u2211 x\u2223\u03b32 \u2223 )\n\u03b31 \u2208\u0398F\n\n\u03b32 \u2208SF\n\n\u2264 max(1, x\n\n\u2212100m\n\n)\n\nx\u2223\u03b31 \u2223+\u2223`(\u03b31 )\u2223+\u2223\u03b32 \u2223\n\n\u2211\n\u03b31 \u2208\u0398F ,\u03b32 \u2208SF\n\n\u2264 max(1, x\n\n\u2212100m\n\n) max(x4 , x6 )\n\nx\u2223f (\u03b31 ,\u03b32 )\u2223\n\n\u2211\n\u03b31 \u2208\u0398F ,\u03b32 \u2208SF\n\n100m\n\n\u22644\n\n6\n\nmax(x , x\n\n\u2212100m+4\n\n)\n\n\u2211\n\nx\u2223\u03b3\u2223\n\n\u03b3\u2208f (\u0398F \u00d7SF )\n\n\u2264 4100m max(x6 , x\u2212100m+4 )Z(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (x),\nwhere in the first inequality we used the fact that `(\u03b31 ) has length smaller than 100m, in\nthe second the fact that \u2223f (\u03b31 , \u03b32 )\u2223 equals \u2223\u03b31 \u2223 + \u2223`(\u03b31 )\u2223 + \u2223\u03b32 \u2223 \u2212 4 or \u2223\u03b31 \u2223 + \u2223`(\u03b31 )\u2223 + \u2223\u03b32 \u2223 \u2212 6,\nand in the third the fact that f is at most 100m2 -to-one.

Let x > 1/\u03bc and let (\u03a9, a, b) be a domain with\ntwo points on the boundary.\u221aLet An be the number of connected subsets of Z2 containing\n0. It is well known that lim n An is finite (see e.g. Theorem 4.20 in [Gri99]). Let therefore\n\u03bb = \u03bb(2) satisfy An \u2264 \u03bbn for all n. We now apply Proposition 3 and get some m = m(x, 2)\nsuch that Zm (x) > 2\u03bb.\nLet \u03b4 > 0 and consider the event A (s) that there exists a connected set S of cardinality\ns at distance larger than 6m of \u03b3\u03b4 . Every box intersecting S must be disjoint from \u03b3\u03b4 , so\nthere must exist a connected family of at least s/(2m + 1)2 boxes of size 2m + 1 covering S\nand not intersecting \u03b3\u03b4 . We may assume this family is maximal among families covering S\nand not intersecting \u03b3\u03b4 . Since the family of boxes is maximal, and because of the condition\nof the theorem that the family of all boxes is connected, the box-distance between the\nunion of boxes and \u03b3\u03b4 is 1.

Let us briefly describe what needs to be changed in higher dimensions. The\nnotion of cardinal edge must be extended: in the box [0, 2m + 1]d , cardinal edges for the\nface [0, 2m + 1]d\u22121 \u00d7 {0} are all the edges joining vertices in {m, m + 1}d\u22121 \u00d7 {0} of the form\n[ (m + 1, . . . , m + 1, m, . . . , m, 0) , (m + 1, . . . , m + 1, m, . . . , m, 0) ]\n \u030111 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  \u0327 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u00b6  \u030111 1 1 1 1 1 1  \u0327 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u00b6\n \u030111 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  \u0327 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u00b6  \u030111 1 1 1 1 1 1  \u0327 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \u00b6\ni\u22121 terms\n\ni terms\n\nd\u2212i terms\n\nd\u2212i\u22121 terms\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d \u2212 1.

Similarly, cardinal edges can be defined for every face. It can be\nshown that the number of polygons included in some box [0, 2m + 1]d and visiting all the\ncardinal edges grows exponentially at the same rate as the number of self-avoiding walks.\nThe proofs then apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n4\n\nQuestions\n\nThe supercritical phase exhibits an interesting behavior.

For x > 1/\u03bc, show that there exists \u03b8(x) > 0 such that for every \u03b5 > 0 and\nevery sufficiently regular domain (\u03a9, a, b),\nP(\u03a9\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,x) (\u2223 \u2223\u03b3\u03b4 \u2223 \u2212 \u03b8(x) \u22c5 \u2223\u03a9\u03b4 \u2223 \u2223 > \u03b5 \u2223\u03a9\u03b4 \u2223) \u00d0\u2192 0 when \u03b4 \u2192 0.\nThe quantity \u03b8(x) would thus be an averaged density of the walk. Note that the\nexistence of \u03b8(x) seems natural since the space-filling curve should look fairly similar in\ndifferent portions of the space.\nAnother challenge is to try to say something nontrivial about the critical phase.\nRecently, the uniformly chosen self-avoiding walk on Zd was proved to be sub-ballistic\n[DCH12]. A natural question would be to prove that it is not space-filling.\nProblem 10. When x = 1/\u03bc and (\u03a9, a, b) is sufficiently regular, show that the sequence\n(\u03b3\u03b4 ) does not become space-filling.\nFinally, we recall the conjecture made in [Smi06] concerning the two-dimensional limit\nin the supercritical phase.\nConjecture 11 (Smirnov). Let (\u03a9, a, b) be a simply connected domain of C and consider approximations by the hexagonal lattice. The law of (\u03b3\u03b4 ) converges to the chordal\nSchramm-L\u00f6wner Evolution in (\u03a9, a, b)\n\u2022 with parameter 8/3 if x = 1/\u03bc,\n\u2022 with parameter 8 if x > 1/\u03bc.\nAcknowledgements.
