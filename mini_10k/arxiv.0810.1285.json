Introduction\nCosmology is a rapidly advancing field thanks to recent progress\nin instrumentation, numerical simulations, and theoretical methods. The last few decades have provided a previously innaccessible wealth of data with the advent of large surveys of the\ncosmic microwave background, galaxy clustering, cosmic shear,\nclusters, and supernovae (see Spergel et al. 2007; Dunkley et al.\n2009, for more recent results and references therein). One of\nthe challenges of cosmology is to link the derived observable\nquantities from these cosmological surveys with the parameters\nof an underlying cosmological model. Another necessary task\nis to predict the performance of future surveys and future observational probes in order to maximise the potential of future\nexperiments. Existing publicly available computational tools\n(Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996; Lewis et al. 2000; Lewis & Bridle\n2002) are widely used within the cosmological community, yet\nthere is at present no a unified tool that considers the low-redshift\nuniverse and its associated probes.\nIn this paper, we present iCosmo, a software package that\nperforms interactive cosmological calculations. The code can\nalso be used as an engine to perform predictions for any cosmological model, and it also forms a convenient platform for developing further cosmological modules. With its extensive documentation, it may also serve as a useful resource for teaching\nand for newcomers in the field of cosmology.\nThe code calculates distance measures, the linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum, the growth factor, volume elements and other quantities for any CDM cosmological model.\nIt also computes derived observable quantities for several cos-\n\nmological probes such as cosmic shear, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and type Ia supernovae. The associated errors for\nthese observables can be described for arbitrary survey parameters, or alternatively, for a number of preset values corresponding to planned surveys and experiments. The code also provides\nforecasts for future cosmological surveys, by allowing the user\nto compute, manipulate, and combine Fisher matrices. The code\nis written in the IDL language, so it benefits from the simple\nsyntax, large scientific libraries and convenient interactive plotting environment of this language. In particular, all the above\ncalculations can be completed in only a few lines of code.\nThe code is freely available at http://www.icosmo.org\nwith full documentation and help files. It is part of the Initiative\nfor Cosmology web site, and it includes an interactive web interface (see description in Kitching et al. 2009).\nIn this paper, we describe the main features of iCosmo and\nprovide several examples illustrating its use. In section 2, we describe the main conventions and architecture of the code. In section 3 we describe how the code can quickly calculate the evolution of the main cosmological quantities, such as distance measures and growth factor, as a function of redshift. In section 4, we\ndescribe how iCosmo calculates the derived observable quantities for cosmic shear, BAO and type Ia supernovae. Section 5\nshows how the code can compute and manipulate Fisher matrices. Our conclusions and possible future developments are presented in section 6.\n\n\f2\n\nRefregier, Amara, Kitching, Rassat: iCosmo, an Interactive Cosmology Package\n\n2. General presentation\nThe iCosmo code is a package of routines written in the IDL\nlanguage. It is divided into several directories corresponding to\nthe different levels of the calculations:\n\u2013 general, plotting: General utility and plotting routines;\n\u2013 cosmo, expt: Routines to define fiducial cosmological and\nsurvey parameters and compute basic cosmological quantities;\n\u2013 lensing, bao, sne: Routines to compute cosmic shear, BAO\nand type Ia supernovae observables;\n\u2013 fisher: Routines to create, plot and manipulate Fisher matrices for cosmological forecasts.\nThe routines in each of the directories make use of the variable structures in IDL. Their functionality is indicated by the\nfirst few letters of their name with the following conventions:\n\u2013 set: set up basic structures with calculation variables,\n\u2013 mk: make or compute a new structure using the information\nin an input structure,\n\u2013 get: get a substructure or derived quantity from an existing\nstructure,\n\u2013 plt: plot,\n\u2013 rd, wt: read and write data from and into a file.\nA description of the main iCosmo routines and associated\ndirectories can be found in Table 1. Detailed explanations for\nany of the routines can be obtained by typing icosmo help,\n'routine name' at the IDL command line. A readme file is available in the distribution and gives installation instructions and a\nquick start tutorial.\nTable 2 shows an example of a typical call sequence for\niCosmo, with the different levels of the code separated by horizontal lines. The following sections describe the use of each\nlevel of the code with examples of call sequences and output\nfigures.\n\n\u2013 pk: Linear and non-linear matter power spectrum P(k, z) tabulated as a function of wavenumber k and redshift z.\nThe evolving scalar quantities can then be plotted easily using the plt cosmo routine (see Inst. 3 in Table 2). As an example, the following call sequence:\ni fid=set fiducial(cosmo={w0:-0.9},calc={fit tk:1})\ni cosmo=mk cosmo(fid)\ni plt cosmo,cosmo,'z','da'\nproduces figure 1 which shows the angular diameter distance\nDA (z) as a function of redshift z, defined in a flat universe by\n\u03c7(z)\n,\nDA (z) =\n1+z\n\n\u03c7(z) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ncdz\u2032\n,\nH(z\u2032 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c7(z) represents the comoving radial distance, H(z) the\nHubble parameter, and c the speed of light. In all figures below, the fiducial cosmology is set to [h = 0.7, \u03a9b = 0.045, \u03a9m =\n0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, w0 = \u22120.95, wa = 0.0, n = 1.0, \u03c4 = 0.09, \u03c38 =\n0.8], unless otherwise stipulated. For example, the call sequence\nabove changes w0 to \u22120.9, which is used in the rest of this paper.\nAs an example of the plotting functionality, the plotting routine plt pk can be used to plot the matter power spectrum P(k, z)\nas a function of wavenumber k at a redshift z, where P(k) is defined as\n\u0001\n\u03b4(k)\u03b4\u2217 (k\u2032 ) = (2\u03c0)3 \u03b43 k \u2212 k\u2032 P(k),\n\n(2)\n\nand \u03b4(k) represents matter fluctuations in Fourier space. For example, figure 2 shows the linear and non-linear power spectrum\nat z = 0 and 1 and is produced by the additional sequence:\ni plt pk,cosmo,z=0,xran=[0.001,10.]\ni plt pk,cosmo,z=0,/over,/linear,linestyle=2\ni plt pk,cosmo,z=1,/over,color=2\ni plt pk,cosmo,z=1,/over,/linear,linestyle=2,color=2\nThe keyword over can be used to overlay several results on a\nsingle figure.\n\n3. Basic cosmological quantities\nThe first level in iCosmo defines the cosmological model\nand computes basic cosmological quantities; see, e.g., Peacock\n(1999) for their definitions and Refregier et al. (2004) for conventions. The first step is to define the fiducial parameter structure using the set fiducial function (see Inst. 1 in Table 2).\nThe resulting fid structure contains the following three substructures:\n\u2013 cosmo: input cosmological parameters,\n\u2013 expt: experiment parameters, such as survey area, number\nof galaxies or SNe as a function of redshift, or preset surveys,\n\u2013 calc: calculation parameters, such as redshift and k-range,\nfitting functions, etc.\nThese parameters have default values that can be easily modified\nusing the syntax of instruction 1 in Table 2.\nThe next step is to compute all the basic cosmological quantities using the mk cosmo function (see Inst. 2 in Table 2). The\nresulting cosmo structure is organised into several substructures:\n\u2013 const: all original fiducial quantities, as well as constant\nquantities derived from the fiducial parameters (e.g., the\nHubble radius),\n\u2013 evol: Evolving scalar quantities such as distance measures,\nthe growth factor, tabulated as a function of redshift,\n\nFig. 1.

Derived cosmological observable quantities\nThe next level of iCosmo consists in the calculations of the derived observables related to different cosmological probes. At\npresent, cosmic shear, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia\nsupernovae are supported. The underlying physics of each of\nthese probes is described below.\n4.1. Cosmic Shear\n\nAs light travels towards us from distant galaxies, its path is perturbed by intervening matter along the line of sight. This causes\ndistortions in the background images and is known as gravitational lensing. To first order this can be described by a distortion\nmatrix:\n!\n\u2202(\u03b4\u03b8i )\n\u03ba + \u03b31 \u03b32\n\u2261\n,\n(3)\n\u03a8i j \u2261\n\u03b32 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b31\n\u2202\u03b8 j\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03b8i (\u03b8) is the deflection vector that results from the lensing. The distortion matrix captures two effects of gravitational\nlensing: the observed image can be dilated or contracted, which\nis described by the convergence \u03ba, and the image can also be\nstretched and compressed along (and at 45\u25e6 from) the x-axis,\nwhich is described by the shear component \u03b31 (\u03b32 ).\nCosmic shear - the statistical measure of shear (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ), uses\nthe two point function of the shear field as a cosmological observable, given by\nCi j (l) =\n\n9 \u0012 H0 \u0013 4 2\n\u03a9m\n16 c\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7h\n\nd\u03c7\n0\n\n\"\n\ngi (\u03c7)\nar(\u03c7)\n\n#\"\n\n#\n!\ng j (\u03c7)\nl\nP ,\u03c7 ,\nar(\u03c7)\nr\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the weighting function is given by\ngi (\u03c7) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7h\n\nd\u03c7\u2032 ni (\u03c7\u2032 )\n\nr(\u03c7)r(\u03c7\u2032 \u2212 \u03c7)\n,\nr(\u03c7\u2032\n\n(5)\n\n\f4\n\nRefregier, Amara, Kitching, Rassat: iCosmo, an Interactive Cosmology Package\n\nPeacock et al.

(2006) concluded that\nthe measurement of the BAO scale was a fundamental tool for\nfuture precision cosmology.\nTo use the information contained in the BAO scale, it is necessary to have an estimate of the accuracy with which a given\nsurvey can measure the scale. In the current version of iCosmo,\nwe use the analytic expression derived in Blake et al. (2006)\nfor the accuracy of the measurement on the BAO scale (though\nthere are several approaches for using information from BAOs,\nas shown in Rassat et al. 2008). This analytic expression was derived from simulations and depends on the central redshift z of\nthe survey, the total volume V of the survey, and the average\nnumber density of galaxies. For the moment, photometric redshift errors are not included in the iCosmo BAO module, though\nit is given in the accuracy expression of Blake et al. (2006). The\nexpression for the accuracy measurement is given by equations\n6-9 in Blake et al. (2006).\n4.3. Type Ia Supernovae\n\nFig. 2. Matter power spectrum at z = 0 and 1, for top and bottom lines, respectively. Linear and non-linear power spectra are\nshown as dashed and solid lines. These plots were derived using\nthe plt pk routine.\n\nwhere r = DaA and DA is the angular-diameter distance. In\nEquation 4, the auto-correlation is given for i = j and the crosscorrelation for i , j, where i and j correspond to galaxy populations at different redshifts. The galaxy distribution function is\ngiven by ni (\u03c7), i.e. the probability\nof finding a galaxy at a disR\ntance \u03c7, and is normalised to d\u03c7ni (\u03c7) = 1.\nIn iCosmo, cosmic shear is implemented using shear\npower spectrum tomography as described in Refs. Hu\n(1999), Hu & Jain (2004), Refregier et al. (2004) and\nAmara & R\u00e9fr\u00e9gier (2007). The uncertainties \u2206Ci j (l) are\ncalculated under the assumption that the two-point function is\nGaussian.\n4.2. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n\nIn the early Universe, just before decoupling, baryons and photons were coupled through Thomson scattering and Coulomb interactions. The photon-baryon fluid was subject to two competing effects: collapse due to gravitational instability and repulsion\ndue to outward pressure. These two effects created oscillations\nin the fluctuation field, visible today in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB, Peebles & Yu 1970; Sunyaev & Zeldovich\n1970), as well as in the galaxy distribution. In Fourier space, this\neffect corresponds to a series of acoustic peaks, dubbed Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAOs). They can be visualised by considering the ratio of a matter power spectrum with baryons, to one\nwithout: Pb (k)/Pnob (k), and in this case are also called 'wiggles'.\nBy measuring the BAOs in the matter power spectrum, it is\npossible to extract a characteristic BAO scale present in both\nthe radial (y) and tangential (y\u2032 ) directions (see section 2.2 of\nBlake et al. 2006):\ny=\n\nr(z)\n,\ns\n\ny\u2032 =\n\nc\n,\nH(z)s\n\n(6)\n\nwhere r(z) corresponds to the comoving radial distance, H(z)\nto the Hubble parameter, s to the comoving sound horizon\nat recombination and c to the speed of light. The reviews by\n\nType Ia supernovae are assumed in cosmology to behave as standard candles; i.e., the rate with which the brightness of a supernova declines is assumed proportional to its intrinsic luminosity.\nThus by measuring the light curves of distant supernovae, it is\npossible to measure their distance, and by obtaining spectra one\ncan compare their distance-redshift relation, which is highly dependent on cosmological parameters.\nThe derived observable for type Ia supernovae is therefore\nthe apparent magnitude m(z) at a given redshift z, related to the\nluminosity distance by\nm(z) = M + 5log10 DL (z),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the H0 -independent luminosity distance DL (z) is given by\nDL (z) \u2261 (H0 /c)(1 + z)\u03c7(z).\n\n(8)\n\nThe normalisation parameter M is given by\nM = M \u2212 5log10 (H0 /c) + cst,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere M is the absolute magnitude.\nThe uncertainty on the magnitude is given by Kim et al.\n(2004):\ns\n!2\n5\u03c3\u03bd\n\u2206m(z) = \u03c32m +\n+ Nz \u03b42m ,\n(10)\ncz ln 10\nwhere \u03c3\u03bd accounts for the scatter in peculiar velocities, \u03c3m the\nobserved variance, and Nz is the number of supernovae redshift\nbins\n4.4. Derived cosmological observables with iCosmo\n\nA typical call sequence is given in Instructions 5-8 in Table 2.\nThe sequence first defines the survey using mk survey and then\ncomputes the derived observable using mk cl tomo, mk bao,\nmk sne, for lensing tomography, BAO and SNe, respectively.\nThe statistical errors in these observables for the fiducial survey\ncan be derived using the correspondng mk cov routines listed in\nTable 1.\nAs an example, the following produces figure 3, a plot of\ncosmic shear power spectra for DUNE (Refregier et al. 2008)\nwith its associated 1\u03c3 error bars:\n\n\fRefregier, Amara, Kitching, Rassat: iCosmo, an Interactive Cosmology Package\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\nfid=set fiducial('DUNE', expt in={sv1 n zbin:2})\ncosmo=mk cosmo(fid)\nsv=mk survey(fid,'sv1')\ncl=mk cl tomo(fid,cosmo,sv)\ncl cov=mk cl cov tomo(fid,cl,sv)\nplt cl,cl,[1,1],cl cov,/errors,yran=[1e-7,1e-3]\nplt cl,cl,[0,1],cl cov,/errors,/over,linestyle=1\nplt cl,cl,[0,0],cl cov,/errors,/over,linestyle=2\n\nThe different power spectra correspond to two different tomographic redshift bins with median redshifts 0.68 and 1.36, as\nwell as their cross-power spectra. Similar call sequences can produce predictions and errors for the BAO distance measures and\nfor SNe Hubble diagrams.\n\n5\n\n\u2013 A cosmological model for how the observable depends on\ncosmological parameters, i.e. a model for calculating C(l) =\nC(l, \u03b8);\n\u2013 An estimate of the uncertainty on the observable, i.e. in our\nexample an estimate of \u2206C(l). This may depend on the experiment (instrument noise, shot noise, etc) as well as on the\ndata estimator (cosmic variance).\nWith the above inputs, it is possible to calculate the FIM,\nwhose components are denoted as Fi j :\n* 2 +\n\u2202 L\nFi j =\n,\n(11)\n\u2202\u03b8i \u2202\u03b8 j\nwhere L = \u2212 ln L, and L = L(x, \u03b8) is the likelihood function or\nthe probability distribution of the data x, which depends on some\ncosmological parameter set \u03b8.\nIn practise, for a given observable C(l, \u03b8), assumed to have\nGaussian errors, the Fisher matrix can be calculated using\nX\n\u2202C(l, \u03b8) \u2202C(l, \u03b8)\n1\n.\n(12)\nFi j \u2243\n2\n\u2202\u03b8i\n\u2202\u03b8 j\n[\u2206C(l)]\nl\nFor example, the coefficients of the Fisher matrix for the supernovae calculation is obtained by calculating (see Tegmark et al.\n1998; Huterer & Turner 2001)\n=\nFiSNIa\nj\n\nNz\nX\nz\n\nFig. 3.

Calculating Fisher Matrices with iCosmo\n\n5. Fisher Matrices\nThe final level of iCosmo is related to the computation and manipulation of Fisher matrices to assess the constraints on cosmological parameters that can be achieved with future surveys.\n5.1. The Fisher Information Matrix\n\nIt is possible to forecast the precision with which a given experiment can constrain cosmological parameters using the Fisher\nInformation Matrix (FIM, see Tegmark et al. 1997, for a detailed\nderivation). A method based on the FIM requires the following\ningredients as input:\n\u2013 A set of cosmological parameters \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , ..., \u03b8i ) for which\none requires predicted constraints;\n\u2013 A choice of underlying fiducial cosmology;\n\u2013 A set of measurements x = (x1 , x2 , ..., xn), for e.g., this could\nbe the shear power spectrum C(l) over a range l = 1...n;\n\nFor this purpose, Fisher matrices can first be computed using the\nmk fisher routines for each probe (see Table 1). The computation is done by taking excursions from the fiducial cosmological model for each of the parameters of interest. Fisher matrices\ncan be combined using the combine fisher routine to derive\njoint cosmological constraints with several surveys and probes.\nThe routine margin fisher can be used to marginalise over unwanted parameters. The resulting contraints can be plotted using\nthe plt fisher routines.\nA typical call sequence to compute and plot Fisher matrices\ncan be found in instructions 9-11 in Table 2. As an example, the\nfollowing sequence computes the Fisher matrices for a DUNE\ncosmic shear survey, a full sky BAO spectroscopic survey\n(20,000 deg2 ), and their combination:\ni fid lens=set fiducial('DUNE')\ni fid bao=set fiducial('bao halfsky')\ni\n\n\f6\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\nRefregier, Amara, Kitching, Rassat: iCosmo, an Interactive Cosmology Package\n\nsv lens=mk survey(fid lens,'sv1')\nsv bao=mk survey(fid bao,'sv2')\nf lens=mk fisher lens(fid lens,sv lens)\nf bao=mk fisher bao(fid bao,sv bao)\nf comb=comb fisher(f lens,f bao)\n\nThe following call sequence produces figure 4 showing the\n68%CL constraints on the dark energy parameters \u03a9DE and w0\nexpected for each surveys separately (blue and red ellipse) and\njointly (solid green ellipse).\ni margin fisher,f lens,f lens2,[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]\ni margin fisher,f bao,f bao2,[0,1,0,0,0,1]\ni margin fisher,f comb,f comb2,[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]\ni plt fisher 2p,f bao2,/nofill,color=2\ni plt fisher 2p,f lens2,/nofill, $\nlinestyle=2,/over\ni plt fisher 2p,f comb2,/over,color=3\nThe margin fisher routine was used to retain only the parameters to be plotted, and marginalise over all the other parameters.\n\nFig. 4.

Conclusions\nThe iCosmo package provides a convenient and flexible interactive tool for cosmological calculations, and it can also\nbe used as a computation engine in batch mode. With all the\nbuilt-in IDL libraries, it is also a convenient platform for developing other cosmological routines and for teaching. The\ncode, along with an interactive web tool Kitching et al. (2009)\nand various cosmological resources are freely available at at\nhttp://www.icosmo.org.\n\nIn the future, we plan to add more features to the code, such\nas the halo model, higher order clustering statistics, and interfaces with CMB Boltzmann codes.
