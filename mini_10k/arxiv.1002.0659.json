These LFV processes, which have been searched in various\nexperiments [1\u20133], can be greatly enhanced in new physics models like supersymmetry [4, 5]\nand the topcolor-assisted models (TC2) [6\u20138]. Such enhancement can be several orders to\nmake them potentially accessible at future collider experiments.\nDue to its rather clean environment, the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) will\nbe an ideal machine to probe new physics. In such a collider, in addition to e+ e\u2212 collision,\nwe can also realize \u03b3\u03b3 collision with the photon beams generated by the backward Compton\nscattering of incident electron- and laser-beams. The LFV interactions in TC2 model will\ninduce various processes at the ILC, such as the productions of \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304, \u03c4 \u0113 and \u03bc\u0113 via e+ e\u2212 . It\nis noticeable that the productions of \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304, \u03c4 \u0113 and \u03bc\u0113 in \u03b3\u03b3 collision have not been studied in\nthe framework of the TC2. Such LFV productions in \u03b3\u03b3 collision may be more important\nthan in e+ e\u2212 collision [8] collision since these productions are a good probe for new physics\nbecause it is essentially free of any SM irreducible background. It is also noticeable that\nall these LFV processes at the ILC involve the same part of the parameter space of the\nTC2. Therefore, it is necessary to comparatively study all these processes to find out which\nprocess is best to probe the TC2 model.\nWe in this work will study the LFV processes \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li l\u0304j (i 6= j and li = e, \u03bc \u03c4 ) induced\nby the extra U(1) gauge boson Z \u2032 in TC2 models. We calculate the production rates to\nfigure out if they can reach the sensitivity of the photon-photon collision of the ILC.\nThe work is organized as follows. We will briefly discuss the TC2 model in Section II,\ngiving the new couplings which will be involved in our calculation. In Section III and IV we\ngive the calculation results and compare with the results in the SUSY. Finally, the conclusion\nis given in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nABOUT TC2 MODEL\n\nThere are many kinds of new physics scenarios predicting new particles, which can lead\nto significant LFV signals. For example, in the minimal supersymmetric SM, a large \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4\n2\n\n\fmixing leads to clear LFV signals in slepton and sneutrino production and in the decays\nof neutralinos and charginos into sleptons and sneutrinos at hadron colliders and lepton\ncolliders [9]. The non-universal U(1) gauge bosons Z \u2032 , which are prediced by various specific\nmodels beyond the SM, can lead to the large tree-level flavor changing(FC) couplings. Thus,\nthese new particles may have significant contributions to some LFV processes [10].\nThe key feature of TC2 models [6] and flavor-universal TC2 models [11] is that the\nlarge top quark mass is mainly generated by topcolor interactions at a scale of order 1\nTeV . The topcolor interactions may be flavor non-universal (as in TC2 models) or flavoruniversal (as in flavor-universal TC2 models). However, to tilt the chiral condensation in\nthe tt\u0304 direction and not form a bb\u0304 condensation, all of these models need a non-universal\nextended hypercharge group U(1). Thus, the existence of the extra U(1) gauge bosons Z \u2032\nis predicted. These new particles treat the third generation fermions (quarks and leptons)\ndifferently from those in the first and second generations, namely, couple preferentially to\nthe third generation fermions. After the mass diagonalization from the flavor eigenbasis into\nthe mass eigenbasis, these new particles lead to tree-level FC couplings. The flavor-diagonal\ncouplings of the extra U(1) gauge bosons Z \u2032 to ordinary fermions, which are related to our\ncalculation, can be written as [6, 12]:\n1\nL = \u2212 g1 {tan \u03b8\u2032 {(\u0113L \u03b3 \u03bc eL + 2\u0113R \u03b3 \u03bc eR + \u03bc\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcL + 2\u03bc\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcR ) + cot \u03b8\u2032 (\u03c4\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c4L + 2\u03c4\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c4R )} * Z\u03bc\u2032\n2\n(1)\nwhere g1 is the ordinary hypercharge gauge coupling constant. \u03b8\u2032 is the mixing angle and\ntan \u03b8\u2032 =\n\n\u221ag1\n2 \u03c0K1\n\nwhere K1 is the coupling constant.\n\nThe flavor-changing couplings of the extra U(1) gauge bosons Z \u2032 to ordinary fermions,\nwhich are related to our calculation, are given in the followings: [6, 12]:\n1\nL = \u2212 g1 {K\u03bce (\u0113L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcL + 2\u0113R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcR ) + k\u03c4 \u03bc (\u03c4\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcL + 2\u03c4\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc \u03bcR ) + k\u03c4 e (\u03c4\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc eL + 2\u03c4\u0304R \u03b3 \u03bc eR )} * Z\u03bc\u2032 ,\n2\n(2)\nwhere k\u03bce , k\u03c4 e and k\u03c4 \u03bc are the flavor mixing factors. Since the new gauge boson Z \u2032 couples\npreferentially to the third generation, the factor K\u03bce are negligibly small, so in the following\nestimation, we will neglect the \u03bc \u2212 e mixing, and consider only the flavor changing coupling\nprocesses \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u0113.\nNote that the difference between the Z \u2032 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 and Z \u2032 \u03c4 \u0113 couplings lies only in the flavor mixing\nfactor K\u03c4 \u03bc and K\u03c4 e and the masses of the final state leptons. Since the non-universal gauge\n3\n\n\fboson Z \u2032 treats the fermions in the third generation differently from those in the first and\nsecond generations and treats the fermions in the first same as those in the second generation,\nso in the following calculation, we will assume K\u03c4 \u03bc = K\u03c4 e . Then what makes the discrepancy\nof the cross sections of the two channels \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u0113 is only the masses of the\nfinal state particles. Considering the large mass MZ \u2032 > 1 TeV, for simplicity, we will take\nM\u03c4 = M\u03bc = Me = 0 in the following discussion, i.e., assuming the cross sections of the two\nchannels \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u0113 are equal to each other.\nIII.\n\nCALCULATION\n\nThe Feynman diagram of the LFV processes \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li lj (i 6= j and li = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) induced\nby the extra U(1) Z \u2032 is shown in Fig. 1.

As we know, in the SM\nproduction of on-shell Z boson at a photon-photon collider (or Z decays into \u03b3\u03b3) is strictly\nforbidden by angular momentum conservation and Bose statistics, which is the predict of the\nfamous Laudau-Yang Theorem. This theorem is still effective to our case, since that the two\nreal photons cannot be in a state with angular momentum J = 1 regardless of on-shell or\noff-shell bosons, so the s-channel contribution with two real photons to an extra Z \u2032 vanishes\nautomatically.\nThe electroweak gauge bosons \u03b3 and Z can not couple to \u03c4 \u0113, \u03bc\u0113 and \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304, so we need\nnot consider the interference effects between the \u03b3, Z and Z \u2032 on the cross section of the\n4\n\n\fprocess \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li l\u0304j (i 6= j and li = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ). In TC2 models the gauge invariant amplitude of\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304(\u0113) induced by the extra boson Z \u2032 is given by\nM=\n\n1\n\u016b\u03c4 \u0393\u03bc\u03bd PL v\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc (\u03bb1 )\u01eb\u03bd (\u03bb2 )\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the \u0393\u03bc\u03bd is defined same as that in [14]. These amplitudes contain the PassarinoVeltman one-loop functions, which are calculated by using LoopTools [15].\nSince the photon beams in \u03b3\u03b3 collision are generated by the backward Compton scattering\nof the incident electron- and the laser-beam, the events number is obtained by convoluting\nthe cross section of \u03b3\u03b3 collision with the photon beam luminosity distribution:\nZ\ndL\u03b3\u03b3\n\u221a\n(4)\nN\u03b3\u03b3\u2192li l\u0304j =\nd s\u03b3\u03b3 \u221a \u03c3\u0302\u03b3\u03b3\u2192li l\u0304j (s\u03b3\u03b3 ) \u2261 Le+ e\u2212 \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\u2192li l\u0304j (s)\nd s\u03b3\u03b3\n\u221a\nwhere dL\u03b3\u03b3 /d s\u03b3\u03b3 is the photon-beam luminosity distribution and \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3\u2192li l\u0304j (s) ( s is the\nsquared center-of-mass energy of e+ e\u2212 collision) is defined as the effective cross section of\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li l\u0304j .

The definitions of parameters \u03be, D(\u03be) and xmax can be found in\nRef.[16]. In our numerical calculation, we choose \u03be = 4.8, D(\u03be) = 1.83 and xmax = 0.83.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nAs for the involved SM parameter, we take [17]\nm\u03bc = 0.106 GeV, m\u03c4 = 1.777 GeV, mb = 4.2 GeV, \u03b1 = 1/137, sin2 \u03b8W = 0.223\n5\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe TC2 parameters concerned in this process are K\u03c4 e , K\u03c4 \u03bc , Ke\u03bc , K1 and the mass of\nthe extra gauge boson MZ\u2032 . Ke\u03bc is very small, about 10\u22123 , we will not consider the e \u2212 \u03bc\nconversion processes. In our calculation, we have assumed K\u03c4 \u03bc = K\u03c4 e \u2243 \u03bb \u2243 0.22 [12, 19],\nwhich \u03bb is the Wolfenstein parameter [18]. It has been shown that the vacuum tilting (the\ntopcolor interactions only condense the top quark but not the bottom quark), the coupling\nconstant K1 should satisfy certain constraint, i.e. K1 \u2264 1 [11]. The limits on the Z \u2032 mass MZ\u2032\ncan be obtained via studying its effects on various experimental observables [12]. Ref.[20],\nfor example, has been shown that to fit the electroweak mearsurement data, the Z \u2032 mass MZ\u2032\nmust be larger than 1 TeV. As numerical estimation, we choose the center-of-mass energy\n\u221a\ns = 500 and 1000 GeV, to observe the different behavior in the two energy area, and take\nthe MZ\u2032 and K1 as free parameters. Finally, Note that the charge conjugate \u03c4\u0304 \u03bc(e) production\nchannel are also included in our numerical study.\n------\n\n\u221as =500GeV\n\n------\n\n\u221as =1000GeV\n\n10\n\nK=\n1 1.\n0\n\n\u03c3(fb)\n\n\u03c3(fb)\n\n1\n\nK=\n1 0.\n6\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nK=\n1 1.\n\n0\n\n1\n\nK=\n1 0.\n6\nK=\n1 0.\n2\n\nK=\n1 0.\n\n2\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\nM Z , (GeV)\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\nM Z , (GeV)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: The cross section \u03c3 of the LFV process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304(\u0113) as a function of the gauge boson Z \u2032\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmass MZ \u2032 for K1 = 0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 with (a) s = 500GeV (b) s = 1000GeV .\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the production cross section \u03c3 of the LFV process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li l\u0304j as a function\nof MZ for three values of the parameter K1 : K1 = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0. We can see from Fig.2\nthat the production cross section \u03c3 increases as K1 increasing and strongly suppressed by\nlarge MZ \u2032 . This situation is slightly different from the result of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 li l\u0304j in [8], in which\n\nfrom Fig.1 we can see the cross section of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u0304\u03c4 increases with K1 decreasing. The\nreason is that the Z \u2032 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 coupling involved in the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 li (li = e or \u03bc) is proportional\n\u221a\n1\nand tan \u03b8\u2032 << 1. We can feel\nto 1/ tan \u03b8\u2032 \u223c K1 , while the Z \u2032 e+ e\u2212 contains tan \u03b8\u2032 \u223c \u221aK\n1\n\nfrom this point the spirit of the technicolor models: to give the natural top quark mass, the\n6\n\n\f1 TeV\nM Z, =\n\n1 TeV\nM Z, =\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1.5\n,\nMZ =\n\n\u03c3(fb)\n\n\u03c3(fb)\n\neV\n\n1.5 T\nM Z, =\n\nTeV\n\n1\n\neV\n\n2.5 T\nM Z, =\n\n-1\n\neV\n\n2.5 T\nM Z, =\n\n\u221as =1000GeV\n------\n\n------\n\n\u221as =500GeV\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n0.05\n\n0.24\n\n0.43\n\n0.62\n\n0.81\n\n1\n\nK1\n\n0.05\n\n0.24\n\n0.43\n\n0.62\n\n0.81\n\n1\n\nK1\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 3: The cross section \u03c3 of the LFV process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304(\u0113) as a function of the parameter K1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith the gauge boson Z \u2032 mass MZ \u2032 = 1 , 1.5 and 2.5 TeV for (a) s = 500GeV (b) s = 1000GeV .\n\nthird generation is singled out from the former two ones, so that it always shows distinct\nfeatures.\nThe background for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e\u03c4\u0304 comes from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 e+ , \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 e+ and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 [5], and we make kinematical cuts [21]: | cos \u03b8l | < 0.9 and\n\nplT > 20 GeV (l = e, \u03bc), to enhance the ratio of signal to background. With these cuts, the\nbackground cross sections from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 e+ , \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 e+ and\n\u221a\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 at s = 500 GeV are suppressed respectively to 9.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 fb, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\nfb and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 fb (see Table I of [21]). To get the 3\u03c3 observing sensitivity with 3.45 \u00d7 102\n\nfb\u22121 integrated luminosity [22], the production rates of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u0113, \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 after the cuts must\nbe larger than 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 fb [21]. We see from Fig.2 that under the current bounds from\nli \u2192 lj \u03b3[3] and \u03bc \u2192 3e[10], the LFV couplings in TC2 models can still large enough to\nenhance the productions \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e\u03c4\u0304 , \u03bc\u03c4\u0304 to the 3\u03c3 sensitivity and may be detected in the future\nILC colliders. Finally note that we in Fig.2 only show the results of the channels with the\n\u03c4 lepton in the final states, i.e., \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304, \u03c4 \u0113.\nFig.3 shows that the cross section of the LFV processes as a function of K1 for MZ\u2032 = 1,\n1.5, 2.5 TeV. We can see more clearly that the cross section is increasing as the K1 increasing.\n\u221a\n\nWe also show the cross sections of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li l\u0304j as a function of center-of-mass energy\ns of the ILC in Fig.4.

It turns out that they may have large cross sections, much larger than the SM\nones, within some extended theories such as the R-parity violating MSSM [5] and the TC2\nmodels. However, in the R-parity violating MSSM, as discussed in [5], the LFV coupling\nby the exchange of the squark is \u03bbijk \u223c 10\u22122 , much smaller than that of the TC2 models\n(K\u03c4 \u03bc(e) \u223c 0.2). Therefore we can evaluate that in the SUSY models the sigma of the LFV\n8\n\n\fprocess \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 li lj is about 2 \u2212 3 order smaller than that in the TC2 models, as shown in\ntable. I.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have performed an analysis for the TC2-induced LFV productions of \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304 and \u03c4 \u0113 via\n\u03b3\u03b3 collision at the ILC. We found that in the optimum part of the parameter space, the\nproduction rate of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304(\u0113) can reach 1 fb. This means that we may have 100 events\neach year for the designed luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 /year at the ILC. Since the SM value of\nthe production rate is completely negligible, the observation of such \u03c4 \u03bc\u0304(\u0113) events would be\na robust evidence of TC2. Therefore, these LFV processes may serve as a sensitive probe of\nTC2.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank J. J. Cao, J. M. Yang and C. P. Yuan for helpful discussion.\n\n[1] G.
