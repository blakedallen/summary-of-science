However, in spite of many\nefforts [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], a unified framework for simultaneously understanding empirical facts\n[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], such as the non-Gaussian\nform and multiscaling in time of the distribution of returns, the linear decorrelation of successive returns, and\nvolatility clustering, has been elusive. This situation\noccurs in many natural phenomena, when strong correlations determine various forms of anomalous scaling\n[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. Here, by employing novel\nmathematical tools at the basis of a generalization of\nthe central limit theorem to strongly correlated variables\n[28], we propose a model of index evolution and a corresponding simulation strategy which account for all robust\nfeatures revealed by the empirical analysis.\nLet S(t) be the value of a given asset at time t. The\nlogarithmic return over the interval [t, t + T ] is defined\nas r(t, T ) \u2261 ln S(t + T ) \u2212 ln S(t), where t = 0, 1, . . .\nand T = 1, 2 . . ., in some unit (e.g., day). From a sufficiently long historical series one can sample the empirical probability density function (PDF) of r over a\ntime T , pT (r), and the joint PDF of two successive returns r1 \u2261 r(t, T ) and r2 \u2261 r(t + T, T ), denoted by\n(2)\np2T (r1 , r2 ). This joint PDF contains the information on\nthe correlation between r1 and r2 in the sampling. A\nwell established property [13, 14, 15, 16] is that, if T is\nlonger than tens of minutes, the linear correlation vanR (2)\nishes: p2T (r1 , r2 )r1 r2 dr1 dr2 \u2261 hr1 r2 ip(2) = 0. This is\n2T\na consequence of the efficiency of the market [3], which\nquickly suppresses any arbitrage opportunity. Another\nremarkable feature is that, within specific T -ranges, pT\napproximately assumes a simple scaling form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nr\npT (r) =\ng\n,\n(1)\nTD\nTD\nwhere g and D are the scaling function and exponent,\nrespectively. Eq. (1) manifests self-similarity, a symmetry often met in natural phenomena [20, 21, 22, 23, 27]:\nplots of T D pT vs r/T D for different T 's collapse onto the\nsame curve representing g. We verify the scaling ansatz\nin Eq. (1) for the Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) index using\na dataset of more than one century (1900-2005) of daily\nclosures. This index is paradigmatic of market behavior\nand the considerable number of data reduces sampling\nfluctuations substantially. In Fig. 1 the collapse of the\nempty symbols is rather satisfactory (the explanation of\nthe meaning of the full symbols in Fig. 1 is given below). The scaling function in Eq. (1) is non-Gaussian\n[2, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Although linear correlations\nvanish, in the T -range considered g is determined by the\nstrong nonlinear correlations of the returns. Only for\nT > \u03c4c (with \u03c4c of the order of the year) successive index\nreturns become independent and pT turns Gaussian in\nforce of the central limit theorem [29].\n\nResults and discussion\nOur first goal is to establish up to what extent the assumption of simple scaling in Eq. (1) does constrain the\n(2)\nstructure of the joint PDF p2T . One must of course have\nR (2)\np2T (r1 , r2 )\u03b4(r \u2212 r1 \u2212 r2 )dr1 dr2 = p2T (r),\nR (2)\np2T (r1 , r2 )dr2 = pT (r1 ),\n(2)\nR (2)\np2T (r1 , r2 )dr1 = pT (r2 ).\n\nIndeed, the first line of Eqs. (2) follows from r(t, 2T ) =\n(2)\nr1 + r2 . Furthermore, since the joint PDF p2T is sampled\nfrom a sequence of time-translated intervals of duration\n2T along the historical series, both the first and the second halves of all such intervals provide an adequate sampling basis for pT . This justifies the second and third lines\nof Eqs. (2). At this point we notice that the property\nhr1 r2 ip(2) = 0 implies that hr2 ip2T = h(r1 + r2 )2 ip(2) =\n2T\n\n2T\n\n2hr2 ipT . In force of Eq. (1), hr2 ipT \u223c T 2D . Hence, we\nobtain 2T 2D = (2T )2D , i.e. D = 1/2. Remarkably, for\nall developed market indices, hr2 ipT is found to scale consistently with a D pretty close to 1/2 [30].\nBy switching to Fourier space in Eq. (2), the notion\nof a novel, generalized product operation allows to iden(2)\ntify a solution for p2T in terms of pT alone. While the\nordinary multiplication of characteristic functions (i.e.,\nFourier transforms) of Gaussian pT 's would yield triv(2)\nially the correct p2T in the case of independent successive returns [29], the generalized product is used here\nto take into account strong nonlinear correlations consistently with the anomalous scaling they determine (see\nSupporting Information) and can be seen to be at the\nbasis of a novel central limit theorem [28]. Our solution\nis strongly supported by the remarkable consistency with\nthe numerical results and by the analogy with the independent case. In Fig. 2 we compare the PDF of the\nreturn r2 conditioned to a given absolute value of the\nreturn r1 , as obtained through our solution (continuous\nlines), with the empirically sampled one (symbols). The\nagreement does not involve fitting parameters, since D\nand those entering the assumed analytical form of g are\nalready fixed in Fig. 1.\nAt this point we must take into account that the simple scaling ansatz in Eq. (1) is only approximately valid\n[7]. Indeed, a consequence of Eq. (1) is h|r|q ipT \u223c T qD ,\nwhich we exploited above for q = 2. However, a careful\nanalysis reveals that the q-th moment exponent deviates\nfrom the linear behavior qD \u2243 q/2 for q & 3 (empty\ncircles in Fig. 3). Like the linear behavior with slope\n1/2 observed for low-order moments, this multiscaling\neffect is common to most indices [30]. To explain this\nfeature, we have to investigate the relation between the\nempirical pT and the stochastic process generating the\n(2)\ntime series. If PDF's like pT and p2T were directly describing such a process, this would be with stationary\nincrements. This assumption is legitimate only for sufficiently long times, larger than \u03c4c .

The average daily trend of the order of 10\u22124 has\nbeen subtracted. The collapse analysis furnishes the scaling\nfunction g reported as the full line and the scaling exponent\nD \u2243 1/2 (see also Fig. 3 and Supporting Information). The\nfull symbols report the data collapse for the results of a single\nsimulation of the DJI history.\n\nin the interplay between scaling and non-stationarity a\nprecise mechanism accounting for the robust features of\npT detected for T \u226a \u03c4c , including its multiscaling.\n(2)\nLet us indicate by pt,T and pt,2T the ensemble PDF's\n(2)\n\ncorresponding to pT and p2T , respectively. The additional dependence on t, the initial time of the interval\n[t, t + T ], shows that we do not assume stationarity for\nthese PDF's. We postulate that, within specific T -ranges\n(e.g., the one in Fig. 1), p0,T obeys a simple scaling like\nthat in Eq. (1), but possibly with a D and a g different\nfrom D and g, respectively. One then realizes that this\nscaling and the linear decorrelation of returns impose on\n(2)\n(2)\npt,2T constraints analogous to those for p2T in Eq. (2),\nexcept for the third one, which now reads\nZ\n(2)\n(3)\np0,2T (r1 , r2 )dr1 \u2261 pT,T (r2 ) = p0,aT (r2 ).\nThis last condition tells us that, as a consequence of\nthe nonlinear correlations, the effective time span of the\n(2)\nmarginal PDF obtained by integrating p0,2T in r1 must\nbe renormalized by a factor a. This factor is determined\nagain by consistency of the second moments scaling properties, as above. Since now h|r|2 ip0,T \u223c T 2D , one gets\nfrom Eq. (3) a = (22D \u2212 1)1/2D . So, D 6= 1/2 implies\na 6= 1 and thus non-stationarity and irreversibility of the\nprocess. Similar functional relations hold for the PDF's\n\n0\n\nr2\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nFIG. 2: Conditional probabilities of daily returns r2 for different values of r1 .

The absolute value of r1 is introduced for\nreducing sample fluctuations.\n\nof the magnetization of critical spin models upon doubling the system size and can be explained in that context by the renormalization group theory [27]. Our generalized multiplication of characteristic functions allows\n(2)\nus to express pt,2T in terms of pt,T and to establish the\ntime-inhomogeneous scaling property\n!\n1\nr\npt,T (r) = p\ng p\n.\n(t + T )2D \u2212 t2D\n(t + T )2D \u2212 t2D\n(4)\nIt remains now to make explicit the link between the\np's and the sampled p's and to determine D. By construction, pT is a t-average of pt,T . Since the time inhomogeneity of pt,T must cross over into homogeneity for t\nexceeding \u03c4c , we expect the following approximation\npT (r) =\n\n\u03c4c \u22121\n1 X\npt,T (r)\n\u03c4c t=0\n\n(5)\n\nto hold. Indeed, the history over which pT is sampled\nis much longer than \u03c4c and allows in principle also an\nindirect sampling of pt,T if we simply assume pt+\u03c4c ,T (r) =\npt,T (r).\nIn spite of the fact that Eq. (4) implies a simple scaling exponent D for p0,T , Eq. (5) leads to the remarkable\nproperty that, independently of D, the low-q moments\nof pT approximately scale with exponent q/2 as soon as\n\u03c4c \u226b 1.

Empty\n(full) circles refer to the DJI data (simulation) of Fig. 1. The\ndashed line is q/2. Multiscaling is due to the deviation of\nD(q) from a constant value. The full line reports the timeaveraged asymptotic (\u03c4c \u226b 1) theoretical prediction based on\nEq. (5).\n\nof the same type as that found empirically: D(q) < 1/2\nfor the high-order moments. The matching of the theoretical predictions for the multiscaling of pT on the basis\nof Eq. (5) with the empirical results is a first way of\nidentifying D. For the DJI, in Fig. 3 we show that with\nD = 0.24 this matching is very satisfactory. The scaling functions of p0,T and pT can also be shown to be\nsimply related, once D is known. We notice that the\nobserved multiscaling features of financial indices, which\ninspired multiplicative cascade models [8, 19] in analogy\nwith turbulence [20, 21], are explained here in terms of\nan additive process possessing the time-inhomogeneous\nscaling (4).\nThe introduction of autoregressive schemes like ARCH\n[5] marked an advance in econometrics and financial analysis [6, 9], and, more generally, in the theory of stochastic\nprocesses. In an autoregressive simulation a number of\nparameters weighting the influence of the past history on\nthe PDF of the following return must be fixed through\nsome optimization procedure. By our approach, a gen(2)\neralization of pt,2T to the case of n-consecutive intervals\ncan be fully expressed just in terms of pt,T and D. This\nis obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of\nour solution for the characteristic function of the joint\nPDF (see Supporting Information). In this way we can\nprecisely calculate the PDF which rules the extraction\nof the i-th return, ri , giving as conditioning inputs the\nprevious m ones, ri\u2212m , . . . , ri\u22121 . Consistently with our\n\nFIG.\ntion\nc(\u03c4 ) \u2261\n\n10\n\n100\n\n\u03c4\n\n4:\nat\nPtmax\nt=0\n\ntime\n\nVolatility\nseparation\n\u03c4\nPtmax\n\nautocorrela(in\ndays),\n\nPtmax\n\n|r(t,1)||r(t+\u03c4,1)|\u2212 t=0 |r(t,1)| t=0 |r(t+\u03c4,1)|/tmax\n,\nPtmax\nPtmax\n|r(t,1)|]2 /tmax\n|r(t,1)|2 \u2212[ t=0\nt=0\n\nwhere tmax + \u03c4 \u2212 1 is the total length of the time series.\nSymbols are as in Fig. 3. The simulation here is precisely\nthe same we refer to in Figs. 1 and 3. The full line gives the\nslope of the time-averaged asymptotic (\u03c4c \u226b 1, \u03c4 . \u03c4c ) model\nprediction for the volatility autocorrelation, superimposed to\nthe data (see Supporting Information).\n\nschematization in Eq. (5), the existence of exogenous factors acting on the market can be taken into account by\nresetting the width of the marginal PDF's with an (average) periodicity equal to \u03c4c (see Supporting Information). The results for a single simulation with m = 100,\n\u03c4c = 500, and D = 0.24 are illustrated by the full symbols in Figs. 1 and 3. The coincidence of the scaling\nproperties observed for the DJI with those of our simulation furnish a second strong indication of the validity\nof our approach and of the estimation of D.\nThe correctness of the value of D can be further\nchecked by considering the volatility autocorrelation\nfunction at time-separation \u03c4 (Fig. 4). A well established fact [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19] is its power law decay\nc(\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u2212\u03b2 for \u03c4 < \u03c4c , with \u03b2 \u2243 0.2 for the DJI. This behavior is not reproduced by routine simulation methods\nin quantitative finance like GARCH [6] and requires the\nintroduction of more sophisticated, fractional integration\ntechniques [9]. The full characterization of the joint PDF\nof n-consecutive returns allows us to obtain a model expression for c(\u03c4 ), which again takes into account the nonstationarity of the process (see Supporting Information).\nSuch an expression behaves asymptotically as a power of\n\u03c4 with an exponent depending on D (c(\u03c4 ) is constant for\nD = 1/2 and decays for D < 1/2). In particular, with\n\n\f5\nD = 0.24 both the model asymptotic expression and the\nresults of our simulation procedure furnish a nice agreement with the exponent \u03b2 \u2243 0.2 observed for the DJI\nindex (Fig. 4). Thus, the algebraic volatility autocorrelation function decay is reproduced by our scheme and\nprovides a second criterion to fix consistently the anomalous scaling exponent D.\nOur approach is based on two postulates:\ninhomogeneous-time scaling and the vanishing of\nlinear return correlations. These symmetries lead, in\nan unambiguous, deductive manner, to a model for\nthe underlying stochastic process determining market\nevolution. Of course, the results follow only when the\npostulates are valid and we have shown that within\nspecific time-ranges the consequences of these postulates\nare in remarkable agreement with the data. Major\n\nadvances in understanding critical phenomena worked\nin a similar vein decades ago [20], when the scaling\nassumptions allowed to establish links between seemingly\ndisparate phenomena and put the basis for the development of renormalization group theory [27]. So far, the\ncoexistence of anomalous scaling with the requirement\nof absence of linear correlation imposed by economic\nprinciples has been regarded as an outstanding open\nproblem in the theory of stochastic processes. We believe\nthat our solution could be relevant for developments in\nthis field, as well as for describing scaling behaviors of\nother complex systems [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].\n\n[1] Bachelier, L.
