Introduction\nD-branes in Calabi\u2013Yau compactification of string theory have been the focus of a\nnumber of recent works. In this work we continue the study of D-branes at Gepner points\ninitiated in [33,4]. We will show how many results for the spectrum of rational boundary\nstates and the corresponding brane world-volume theories can be derived starting from the\nlinear sigma model. The basic idea is to realize the boundary states as fractional branes in\nthe Landau\u2013Ginzburg orbifold phase; we will show how recent mathematical work on the\ngeneralized McKay correspondence determines the identification of these boundary states\nas bundles in the large volume limit, and check this identification in an example against\nresults obtained using mirror symmetry. As in [15], this framework allows identifying\nbound states of branes with bundles and provides explicit descriptions of their moduli\nspaces; we will pursue this in more detail in subsequent work.\nFor an overview of this line of work, we refer to [12]. The starting point is Gepner's identification of certain N = 2 CFT's as stringy Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds (CYs). In\n[33], rational boundary states (those which can be easily obtained as orbifold products of\nboundary states in the individual N = 2 minimal models) were constructed for Gepner\nmodels. This provides explicit CFT realizations of D-branes on these manifolds, and allows\ncomputing RR charges (in a natural basis at the Gepner point), as well as the number of\nmarginal operators. It is also possible to compute superpotentials, as outlined in [4] and\nas has been done in examples [5].\nThe natural extension of Gepner's identification would be to identify these BPS boundary states with specific D-branes in the large volume limit of the same Calabi\u2013Yau. The\nwork [4] made first steps towards such an identification. The \"decoupling conjecture\"\nmade there gives strong reasons to think that B branes at any point in K\u00e4hler moduli\nspace should be identifiable with specific holomorphic objects (bundles, coherent sheaves\nor complexes) in the large volume limit. Using a derivation of the K\u00e4hler moduli space\nfrom mirror symmetry [7], an explicit translation of the RR charges of the B boundary\nstates in the (3)5 Gepner model into Chern classes was made, which determines the topological type of the corresponding bundles in the large volume limit. Similar results for\nother Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds have been obtained in [10,25,38,32].\nIn [15] the C3 /Z3 orbifold was studied in detail, and a remarkable relation was found\nbetween the quiver gauge theory of [36,37,16] and Beilinson's construction [2] of holomorphic vector bundles on IP2 : the quiver theory and mirror symmetry results reproduce this\n1\n\n\fconstruction, providing a very detailed correspondence between F-flat configurations of\nthe gauge theory and holomorphic bundles in the large volume limit. It was also pointed\nout that the results of [4] for the quintic had a very similar relationship to Beilinson's\nconstruction of bundles on IP4 .\nThe present work will explain and generalize this relationship. Besides the work\nabove, it is inspired by a generalization of Beilinson's construction developed in recent\nmathematical work on the generalized McKay correspondence [34,23,3].\nThe basic idea is to realize the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold of interest as a submanifold of the\nresolution of a higher dimensional orbifold Cn /\u0393, define D-branes in the higher dimensional\norbifold using the construction of Douglas and Moore [17], and then identify the D-branes\nof interest as the restriction of these to the original CY. As we explain, this procedure can\nalso be directly motivated by the physics of boundary states in the linear sigma model\nconstruction of the CY [40,20,19,21].\nAcknowledgements. We would like to express our special thanks to Dave Morrison for\ncollaboration on the early stages of this project, and for many valuable discussions and\nsuggestions.\n\n2. Gepner models and quivers\n2.1. Gepner models and linear sigma models\nA Gepner model is a product of r minimal models at level ki whose central charges\n3ki /(ki +2) add to 3n. As we will review shortly, this corresponds to a Fermat hypersurface\nin a weighted projective space, which if n + r is even is WIP(wi ), where wi = K/(ki + 2)\nand K = lcm{ki + 2}. If n + r is odd, we adjoin wr+1 = K/2 to this list, and henceforth\nP\ntake n+r even. One can show that for r = n+2, these requirements imply that K =\nwi .\nWhen n = 3, such a Gepner model can also be realized as a (2, 2) linear sigma model\n\n[40]. It has a U (1) gauge group, r chiral superfields Z i with charges wi , and a chiral\nP\nsuperfield P with charge \u2212K. There is a superpotential WG = P i (Z i )ki +2 . The D-\n\nflatness conditions are\n\n\u03b6=\n\nX\n\nwi |Z i |2 \u2212 K|P |2\n\n(2.1)\n\ni\n\nwith an FI parameter \u03b6, and the model has two phases depending on this parameter.\nThe Gepner model is associated with the \"Landau\u2013Ginzburg\" phase with \u03b6 < 0 and\n2\n\n\fhP i 6= 0; the action expanded around this configuration is a sum of N = 2 Landau\u2013\nGinzburg models, while the U (1) symmetry is broken to ZK . On the other hand, \u03b6 > 0\nproduces the \"geometric\" phase in which D-flat configurations with P = 0 parameterize\nthe weighted projective space WIP(wi ), while the condition 0 = \u2202WG /\u2202P defines the CY\nas a hypersurface in this space.\nIt will be useful to have a picture of the space of D-flat configurations (in other words,\nthe vacua of the corresponding theory with no superpotential) in the two phases. The\ngeneral D-flat configuration in the geometric phase allows P 6= 0 and the total space is a\nP\nline bundle over WIP(wi ). For K =\nwi this is the anticanonical bundle, and the total\nspace is itself a Calabi\u2013Yau, generically singular because of the singularities of WIP(wi ).\nLet us denote this Calabi\u2013Yau as X(wi ) or simply X.\nSimilarly, in the Landau\u2013Ginzburg phase the general D-flat configuration has Z i 6= 0.\nThe condition (2.1) determines P and since hP i =\n6 0 always, the U (1) gauge symmetry is\nalways broken to ZK . Thus the D-flat moduli space in this phase is Cr /ZK with the ZK\naction defined by the action of a generator\ng(Z i ) = e2\u03c0iwi /K Z i .\nNote that this generates a discrete subgroup of SU (r), so this noncompact orbifold is also\na CY.\nIn a later section, we will review the toric description of these configuration spaces and\nthe relation between these two phases. The general idea is that the algebra of holomorphic\nfunctions on the configuration space is independent of the D-flatness conditions, and thus\nmust be the same in the two phases. Thus we can consider the space X(wi ) as a (partial)\nresolution of the noncompact orbifold Cr /ZK . In both phases, the superpotential will\nconfine the theory to the CY3 as a hypersurface in the exceptional divisor, Z i = 0 in\nCr /ZK , and the resolution of this point \u03c0 \u22121 (0) in X.\n2.2. B boundary states\nOur basic claim is that the rational B boundary states can be thought of as the\nrestriction of the \"fractional brane\" states of the Cr /ZK orbifold to the CY3 .\nA fractional brane state in a Cr /\u0393 orbifold is a Dirichlet boundary state in Cr , with\nan additional choice of an irreducible representation of \u0393. A collection of fractional branes\nis labeled by a representation R of \u0393 or equivalently the multiplicities na of the irreps \u03b3a .\n3\n\n\fThe world-volume theory of the collection is then derived from the world-volume theory of\ndim R branes in Cr by projecting on invariants under the action of \u0393 on the fields twisted\nby the \u03b3a 's; in particular vectors Z i in Cr (such as those parameterizing transverse motion\nof the branes) are projected as\n\u03b3R (g)\u22121 Z i \u03b3R (g) = (\u03b3def )ij (g)Z j .\nThese definitions do not require \u0109 \u2264 10 or even that the bulk theory of interest be\na conformal field theory. Thus we can apply them directly to the LG orbifold phase\nof the linear sigma model. It is known that Dirichlet boundary conditions are N = 2\nsupersymmetric in the ungauged LG model [39,20,21]. If we work far below the scale of\nU (1) gauge symmetry breaking (set by the vev of P and thus the FI term), the full (B type)\nlinear sigma model boundary conditions must reduce to conventional Dirichlet boundary\nconditions for Z i . We need only take the unbroken discrete gauge symmetry into account,\nwhich is what is done by the fractional brane prescription.\nNow, since we start with a non conformal theory, we must expect the IR spectrum of\nmarginal operators to be rather different from the UV free theory spectrum, raising the\nquestion of what world-volume theory we should take for the branes.\nWe do know that the flow must preserve the massless Ramond states, as these are\nprotected by the usual index considerations. We can thus compute the massless Ramond\nspectrum in the UV and carry it to the IR.\nWe then make the crucial assumption that-although the combinations of BPS branes\nwe are considering together break all supersymmetry (they preserve different N = 1 subalgebras of the original N = 2)-this supersymmetry breaking is a spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in an effective N = 1, d = 4 world-volume theory. In particular, combinations\nof BPS branes which together would break supersymmetry can lead to BPS bound states,\nwhich are simply described by (quasi)-supersymmetric vacua of the combined theory. This\nassumption is not completely obvious, especially as we will be discussing fields with string\nscale masses in the broken supersymmetry vacua, and as we will see it is literally true only\nfor a subset of the theories. It is further discussed and motivated in [13]. In any case, we\nproceed to postulate an effective N = 1 world-volume theory which is compatible with our\ninformation.\nThe massless open string Ramond sector for the CFT of r free superfields will simply\nbe a spinor (of definite chirality) of SO(2r), or equivalently a sum of antisymmetric representations of SU (r). In the familiar case of C3 orbifolds, this leads to a singlet and a\n4\n\n\fvector of SU (3), and supersymmetry incorporates these into space-time vector and chiral\nmultiplets respectively. The resulting world-volume theory is the familiar N = 4 super\nYang\u2013Mills and its dimensional reductions, to which the \u0393 projection is applied.\nIn the case of C5 orbifolds, these considerations lead to a vector of SU (5), a three\nindex antisymmetric tensor, and a singlet (equivalently a five index antisymmetric tensor).\nWe then assume that the flow to the IR leads to a (2, 2) supersymmetric theory with an\nN = 1, d = 4 world-volume interpretation. On general grounds, the nonsinglets will have\nto enter into chiral multiplets in this theory. The singlet might enter into either chiral or\nvector multiplets a priori, but given that any boundary theory will contain the operator 1\nwhich is the internal CFT part of the gauge boson vertex operator, there must be a vector\nmultiplet in the space-time theory, whose fermion must be this singlet.\nThis motivates the claim that the world-volume theory of N D-branes on Z5 /\u0393 (assuming N = 1 supersymmetry) is a U (N ) gauge theory with 15 chiral multiplets in the\nadjoint of U (N ), transforming as 5 + 10 of a global SU (5). Let us denote these multiplets\nas X i and Y [ij] respectively.\nSuch a theory admits gauge invariant superpotentials, and the leading possible term\nis cubic:\nW = tr X i X j Y [ij] + . . . .\n\n(2.2)\n\nSuch a term in the superpotential is also natural from the CFT point of view and as\ndiscussed in [4], it can be computed in the topologically twisted model. The non-zero\namplitudes are those in which the operators combine to saturate the fermion zero modes;\nin terms of the translation to forms on C5 given above they are the amplitudes in which\nthe product of the forms involved produces a top form on C5 , which produce exactly (2.2).\n2.3. Quiver gauge theory\nWe now apply the orbifold projection to derive the world-volume theory of boundary\nstates on C5 /\u0393. We will discuss \u0393 \u223c\n= ZK in detail here, though similar considerations would\napply to nonabelian groups, as for C2 /\u0393 in [24]. It will be a quiver theory with K nodes,\nij\ni\nchiral superfields in the 5 of SU (5) XM,M\n+wi , chiral superfields in the 10 YM,M \u2212wi \u2212wj \u2261\nji\n\u2212YM,M\n\u2212wi \u2212wj , and the restriction of (2.2),\n\nW =\n\nX\n\nj\nij\ni\nXM,M\n+wi XM +wi ,M +wi +wj YM +wi +wj ,M .\n\nM,i,j\n\n5\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fIndeed all of this data agrees with the explicit CFT results of [33,4]. B boundary\nstates in these models are characterized by labels Li in each minimal model factor and\nP\nM=\nwj Mj in [0, 2K \u2212 1]. In particular, if we define the states |M i with a given M and\nall Li = 0, and the operator g acting as M \u2192 M + 2, then we can write the intersection\n\nmatrix between the L = 0 states as\nIG =\n\nY\n(1 \u2212 g wj )\nj\n\n=\n\nX\n\n(\u2212)\n\nkj =0,1\n\nP\n\nkj\n\ng\n\nP\n\nkj wj\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhich agrees with the massless Ramond spectrum we described. This term in the superpotential can be checked from CFT [5].\nIn general the superpotential will contain higher order terms as well. These are computable in CFT and are also topological, but not too much is known about them at present.\nOur results so far are consistent with the idea that in the theories in which the low energy\ndescription is justified (we will explain this point shortly), such terms are absent, but this\nremains to be seen.\nThe final item required to complete the specification of the world-volume gauge theories is the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms for the U (1)K subgroup of the gauge group. As pointed\nout in [14,13], these can be determined from the masses of the bosonic superpartners of the\nmassless fermions, which are also known from CFT. These superpartners can be defined\nusing the spectral flow operator on either brane (they produce the same result up to a\nphase) and in the Gepner models under discussion are obtained by multiplying the top\nchiral primaries in a subset of the individual minimal model factors. The result is that\ni\na boson on a link from M to M + w has m2 = \u2212w\u03bb where we consider XM,M\n+wi as\n[ij]\n\n\"forward\" links (so these are tachyonic) and YM,M \u2212wi \u2212wj as \"backward\" links (so these\nare massive). \u03bb is computable and order string scale.\nThe FI terms must then reproduce these masses\nm2ij = \u03b6i \u2212 \u03b6j\nwhere \u03b6i is the FI term for the U (1) of the i'th brane. In fact one can argue directly for this\nstructure from general properties of N = 2 CFT: the \u03b6i and thus m2 are directly related\nto the overall U (1) charge and thus the phases of the central charges of the two branes\n[13].\n6\n\n\fThis determines the FI terms to be \u03b6k = k\u03bb, but one immediately notices that this\ncannot reproduces all the masses in all theories. The condition for it to work is that we do\nnot have links going \"all the away around the clock,\" for example closed loops with only\nX fields. It does not forbid closed loops involving both X and Y .\nThis is a condition on the allowed fractional brane content: if all types of fractional\nbranes are present it will fail, but it can be satisfied by excluding some types of fractional\nbranes. If it fails, the masses cannot all be reproduced in this low energy field theory\ndescription, which probably signals its breakdown. As we will see, such configurations\ntypically restrict to branes on the Calabi-Yau with zero RR charge (or with simpler realizations) and would thus be expected to decay to the vacuum (or the simpler realization);\nthis process would then not have a description purely in the low energy theory.\nIn conclusion, we have derived the low energy theories of combinations of the L = 0\nGepner model branes by adapting the orbifold construction to C5 /ZK in a way suggested\nby linear sigma model considerations. The result is a quiver gauge theory very analogous\nto those for C3 /\u0393 orbifolds. The construction generalizes straightforwardly to general\nquotients Cr /\u0393.\n2.4. Bound states\nWe now make the general claim that supersymmetric vacua of these theories with\nunbroken gauge symmetry U (1) correspond to general (classical) bound states of these\nrational branes. If one keeps all the modes of the open string theory (e.g. by using string\nfield theory), this claim seems difficult to dispute. A less obvious claim is that many bound\nstates can be described purely within the theory obtained by keeping the chiral primaries,\nin other words the theories we just derived. The potential problem is that the FI terms\nand thus the vevs of the fields at the supersymmetric vacuum have string-scale values.\nNevertheless, as we discussed, in a large subset of the theories we discussed, those\nwith chiral fields whose masses can be reproduced by FI terms, there is no a priori reason\nfor this description to break down. A basic test of it which can be done is to construct\nnon-rigid (L > 0) rational branes as bound states of the L = 0 branes and check that the\ndimension of the moduli space comes out right. Some non-trivial examples of this for the\nquintic were discussed in [15], and further examples will be discussed in [9].\nNow, work on non-BPS brane configurations in flat space and other simpler examples\ndoes support the claim that in many cases a good qualitative description can be obtained\njust using tachyons and massless fields. Thus it should probably not be too surprising\n7\n\n\fthat this works in some subset of the theories we just derived. Whether this works in\nall the theories which a priori appear sensible, and whether string field theory or similar\nframeworks can provide a more general description, are important questions for further\nwork.\n\n3. The large volume interpretation of the fractional branes\nIn [15], it was noticed that the large volume interpretation of the fractional branes of\nthe C3 /Z3 orbifold found using mirror symmetry [10] gave the same bundles which form\nthe natural basis (due to Beilinson) for the general construction of bundles on IP2 , which\nis the exceptional divisor of the resolution of C3 /Z3 .\nAs it turns out, recent mathematical work has led to a very general conjecture for the\nhigher dimensional analog of this correspondence, which we will be able to apply directly\nto our C5 /\u0393 theories [34,3,23].\nThe idea is to generalize the famous McKay correspondence [29] between discrete\nsubgroups \u0393 of SU (2) and finite simply laced Dynkin diagrams to discrete subgroups\n\u0393 \u2282 SU (N ). More specifically, one has a relation between the representation ring of \u0393\n(which is directly encoded in the Dynkin diagram) and a basis for the exceptional cycles\nin a resolution of a C2 /\u0393 singularity. According to [34], the idea that a higher dimensional\ngeneralization should exist actually has its origins in the study of orbifolds in string theory,\nand the observation that the Euler number of a resolved C3 /\u0393 singularity equals the number\nof conjugacy classes of \u0393.\nThe precise version of this idea which has been generalized is a duality between the\ncategory of sheaves on X \u223c\n= Cn /\u0393, and the category of sheaves with compact support,\nwhich for X \u223c\n= Cn /\u0393 will be sheaves supported at the origin (or, if a partial resolution has\nbeen performed, on the exceptional divisor).\nIn making this precise, one must work with specific categories. The duality can be\nmade quite concrete, as was done by Ito and Nakajima in [23], where the dual objects are\nconstructed as explicit complexes of line bundles. This should allow making a detailed\nidentification between quiver representations and large volume sheaves along the lines of\n[15]. In [3], the duality was shown to be an equivalence between derived categories, which\nshould allow proving the analog of Beilinson's theorem for this case. Although less concrete,\nthis is still a very strong statement about the relation between the two categories.\n8\n\n\fHere we will content ourselves with deriving the K-theory classes which correspond\nto the dual basis. We will then restrict these to the Calabi\u2013Yau and compare with the\npredictions of mirror symmetry in a solved example.\nThe mathematics of the generalized McKay correspondence is clearly described in\n[34,3,23] and thus in the remainder of this section we concentrate on describing the ideas\nfor physicists.\n3.1. Orbifold resolution, tautological line bundles, and dual bases\nThe problem of resolving singularities X = C2 /\u0393 has a long mathematical history,\ngoing back to Klein (see [35] for some of this background). Such a singular variety X\ncan be resolved to a smooth space Y with non-trivial H 2 (Y ) and intersection form given\nby the Cartan matrix of the extended ADE Dynkin diagram associated to the subgroup\n\u0393 \u2208 SU (2).\nThe most basic string theory application of this is to the duality between IIa strings\non K3 and heterotic strings on T 4 [22], where IIa D2-branes wrapped on the resolved (or\n\"exceptional\") cycles provide the nonabelian gauge bosons of the enhanced ADE gauge\nsymmetry predicted by duality.\nThe most direct connection between this geometry and the structure of the group \u0393\nappears in the McKay correspondence. The McKay quiver associated to \u0393 has a node for\nevery irrep ri of \u0393, and a link from ri to rj for every component rj in rdef \u2297 ri , where rdef\nis the representation by which \u0393 acts on C2 . The result is a quiver which can be simply\nobtained from the ADE extended Dynkin diagram by replacing each link of the latter by\na pair of links of opposite orientation.\nThis construction can also form the basis of an explicit construction of the resolved\nspace, as was done by Kronheimer [26,27]. Physically the same construction appears in\ndefining D-branes on the quotient space, and provides an explicit gauge theory description\nof the resolution [17]. It furthermore provides an explicit description of the branes wrapped\non the exceptional cycles; these are \"fractional branes\" obtained by using irreducible representations in the quotient construction. One thus has the basic prediction that there\nshould exist a natural basis for H 2 (Y ), or better the K-theory of the resolved singularity,\nlabeled by irreducible representations of \u0393.\nIn this context the relation between the Dynkin diagram and the intersection form has\na physical interpretation as well: each link corresponds to a hypermultiplet coming from\n9\n\n\fopen strings stretched between a pair of fractional branes; their number can be computed\nfrom the index theorem and is equal to the intersection number.\nAn even more general physical system was studied in [17], containing both Dp-branes\nat points in X and Dp + 4-branes extending in X. It was found to reproduce a construction of general self-dual gauge fields on the resolved singularity due to Kronheimer and\nNakajima [28]. Now both types of branes are labeled by a choice of group representation,\nand each can be associated to a quiver node. Let Ri be the Dp + 4 node corresponding to\nri and S j be the Dp node corresponding to rj . The spectrum of (p, p + 4)-strings between\na pair (Ri , S j ) is also determined by the orbifold projection and one finds the number of\nhypermultiplets to be \u03b4ij . As in our previous discussion, this implies that the intersection\nform between the two types of branes should be\nhRi , S j i = \u03b4ij .\n\n(3.1)\n\nNow the interpretation of the Dp + 4 (extended) branes as bundles is rather clear, at\nleast far from the singularity. The orbifold projection acts on the Yang\u2013Mills connection\nas\n\u03b3Ai (z)\u03b3 \u22121 = rij Aj (g(z)).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis tells us that scalar matter in the fundamental, i.e., a section of the associated bundle,\nmust transform as\n\u03b3\u03c6(z) = \u03c6(g(z)).\n\n(3.3)\n\nA particularly simple case is to take \u03b3 to be the regular representation, in which case we\ncan consider \u03c6(z) as a vector-valued field indexed by an element of \u0393, so (3.3) becomes\n\u03c6gh (z) = \u03c6h (g(z)).\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis bundle is referred to as the \"tautological bundle\" over the quotient space. It can be\ndecomposed as a direct sum over bundles Ri associated to irreps \u03b3 which if \u0393 is abelian\nare line bundles; these are the tautological line bundles.\nThe dual relation (3.1) then determines the bundles Sj . On a noncompact space X, the\nnatural duality for K-theory (just as for cohomology) is between K(X) and the K-theory\nof bundles with compact support Kc (X), meaning bundles over compact submanifolds of\nX. Thus the bundles S j naturally live in Kc (X) and provide a preferred basis for it. These\nare the bundles associated to the fractional Dp-branes.\n10\n\n\fGiven the intersection form in an explicit basis, we can make this definition quite\nconcrete. For example, if we have\nhRi , Rj i \u2261 (I \u22121 )ij ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nS j = I ij Ri\n\n(3.6)\n\nhS j , S k i = I jk .\n\n(3.7)\n\nthen we can write\n\nfor which\n\nAs in [23], the relation (3.6) can be used to define the S j as complexes built from the\nbundles Ri . In terms of the K-theory classes, (3.6) becomes\n[S j ] = I ij [Ri ],\n\n(3.8)\n\na simple explicit formula for the K-theory classes of the fractional branes given those of\nthe tautological line bundles.\nRestricting these bundles or their classes to a subvariety, such as a Calabi\u2013Yau embedded in the exceptional divisor, is a standard operation: let V j = S j |CY be these\nrestrictions. Thus we can define an intersection form on the Calabi\u2013Yau\nZ\nj\njk\nj\nk\nICY = hV , V iCY =\nch(V )ch(V k )Td(CY ),\n\n(3.9)\n\nCY\n\nand the conjecture is that\nICY = IG\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere IG is the intersection form (2.4) of section 2.\nThe result is a physically motivated prediction for the K-theory classes of the rational\nB boundary states, which we will test against results derived using mirror symmetry.\nIndeed, the example of the quintic discussed in [15] is already a non-trivial test, as the\nprocedure we just described leads to Beilinson's dual bases in the case of Cn /Zn , which as\nchecked there agree with the results of [4].\nAlthough (3.8) is the formula we will test in this paper, let us emphasize that (3.6)\nprovides a definition of the fractional branes S j as holomorphic objects, not just K-theory\nclasses. This is made quite explicit in [3,23], where the dual bases in (3.1) are used to\nconstruct a resolution of the diagonal, which can be used to prove Beilinson's theorem for\n11\n\n\fthese spaces. This leads to explicit large volume interpretations of general bound states of\nthe fractional branes as complexes of sheaves, as we will discuss in future work [9].\nSo far, none of our definitions had any real dependence on the dimension of X; we\ncould make the same discussion for Cn /\u0393 for any n. The point where such dependence will\ncome in is when we discuss the resolution of the singular space X in detail. Indeed, unless\nwe can resolve X, it is not obvious in what sense the Ri can be thought of as bundles\nor how to compute their K-theory classes. General theory [18] does tell us that given a\nresolution Y of X, there will be a natural lift of these K-theory classes to Y , but we might\nexpect this to depend on the particular resolution we choose.\nThus we need to discuss the resolution of X in more detail. One idea which has been\nused with great success in the math literature has been to use subspaces of the Hilbert\nscheme of N = |\u0393| points on Cn which are invariant under \u0393. It has been shown for n = 2\nand all \u0393, and n = 3 and abelian \u0393, that such a subspace provides a canonical complete\nresolution Y of X. The definition of tautological bundle then lifts naturally to Y , and the\nstory can be completed in this framework.\nFor n > 3 there are known examples in which this construction does not produce a\ncomplete resolution. Moreover, the Hilbert scheme becomes progressively more difficult to\nwork with in higher dimensions.\nAn alternate approach is to define the quotient X as the moduli space of a quiver gauge\ntheory, and then find the resolution Y by the usual procedure of turning on Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos\nterms. This approach was successfully used for C3 /\u0393 by Ito and Nakajima and is clearly\nwell motivated in our D-brane application, so we shall follow it below. One disadvantage of\nthis approach is that the choice of Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos terms generally translates into a choice\nof resolution; it is not obvious that any of these is preferred. However, as we argued, the\nGepner models produce quiver gauge theories come with a natural choice of FI terms, so\nwe should try to make the construction work with these.\n\n4. Orbifolds via toric methods\nA general procedure for analyzing abelian orbifolds as toric varieties was given in [16].\nWe will briefly review this, and give the definition of the tautological line bundles in this\ncontext.\nD-branes in orbifold backgrounds are described by supersymmetric world-volume\ngauge theories, as was shown in [17] for orbifolds in flat space and as we have argued\n12\n\n\fhere for Landau\u2013Ginzburg orbifolds. The resolved orbifold will be the moduli space of\nsupersymmetric vacua of the regular representation theory.\nIn physical terms, a toric variety can be defined as the moduli space of vacua for an\nabelian N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with no superpotential. While the moduli\nspace of vacua for a general supersymmetric gauge theory does not admit a toric realization,\ntheories for which the F-flatness constraints can be written as relations between monomials\ndo.\nIn the general class of theories we described, the F-flatness conditions are indeed\nrelations between monomials: they are\nj\nj\ni\ni\nXM,M\n+wi XM +wi ,M +wi +wj = XM,M +wj XM +wj +wi ,\n\n(4.1)\n\ni\nwhere M = 1, . . . , |\u0393| labels the nodes of the quiver diagram and XM,M\n+wi are the chiral\n\nmultiplets.\n\n1\n\nAs explained in [16], the solutions to these constraints are parameterized by\n\nan affine toric variety Z \u2282 Cd|\u0393| , which has been called the variety of commuting matrices\nin [1].\nThe idea which allows describing this as a toric variety can be illustrated with the\nvariety X defined by the simple relation xy = wz. Let us solve for z as z = xy/w. We\ncan then describe the space of functions on the variety, as the functions f (w, x, y) which\nare generated by multiplying the monomials w, x and y and the monomial xy/w. In other\nwords, the presence of z is described by admitting more functions than we would on C3 .\nThe set of exponents of these monomials is the cone M+ generated by positive integral\ncombinations of the vectors (1 0 0), (0 1 0), (0 0 1) and (\u22121 1 1).\nThe same data can be described by giving the dual cone N+ of vectors satisfying\nn * m \u2265 0. In this case it would be generated by na = (1 1 0), nb = (1 0 1), nc = (0 1 0)\nand nd = (0 0 1).\nNow we can describe the space of functions on X by associating variables with these\ngenerators of N+ , say a, b, c and d, and writing monomials in these variables. The nontrivial data about X is now expressed in the relations between the generators. In our\nexample there is a single relation, na + nd = nb + nc .\n1\n\nWe are only considering the special case Y = 0 here, as this is what makes direct contact\n\nwith [23] and the resolution to weighted projective spaces. The moduli Y appear to be connected\nwith deformations of bundles which appear after restriction to the CY [9].\n\n13\n\n\fThe important fact is now that constraints are dual to gauge invariances, where\nduality is in the linear algebra sense. This is fairly obvious on reflection but can be best\nseen by using the language of exact sequences. Consider a sequence\nf\n\ng\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 0.\nIts exactness means that g * f = 0.\nOne interpretation we could make of this is that g = 0 expresses a set of constraints\non the space B, parameterized by elements of C. The map f would then be an explicit\nset of solutions to the constraints, parameterized by elements of A.\nAnother possible interpretation is that we have abelian gauge symmetries acting on\nthe space B, described by the image of the map f and parameterized by elements of A. We\ncould then regard C as the gauge invariant subspace or quotient B/A. This formulation\nis the best when we can use it, as it avoids the need to make an explicit choice of a gauge\nslice; if we needed to exhibit a slice in B we would need to choose a partial inverse h of g\nsatisfying g * h = 1|C ; h would then give a map from C to the slice.\nThe point now is that duality (in the linear algebra sense) reverses all the arrows and\nthus the roles of the maps f and g. This leads to duality between constraints and gauge\ninvariances.\nIn this example, the dual relation between M+ and N+ implies that constraints on\nthe M monomials will lead to gauge invariances for the N monomials. This is formalized\nby writing the space X as the spectrum of the algebra of monomials. Defining this algebra\nas Hom(M, C) allows applying the previous discussion; see for example [8].\nThus, the relation na + nd = nb + nc of our example should translate into a gauge\ninvariance, with U (1) acting on the four variables (a b c d) with the charges (1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 1).\nWe can test this claim by writing out the gauge invariant monomials and checking that\nthey satisfy the relation. Indeed, these are ab, ac, db and dc, which can be identified with\nthe original w, x, y, and z satisfying the relation xy = wz.\nThis type of realization, in which the relations between generators of N+ are interpreted as gauge invariances, is completely general, and gives a method for turning the\nF-flatness constraints into abelian gauge invariances. Thus we can realize the final moduli\nspace of vacua entirely as a toric variety. The main difference between the original abelian\ngauge invariances and the newly generated ones is that the former will typically come with\nFI terms, while the latter will not.\n14\n\n\fU (1) gauge groups with non-zero FI terms will typically be associated to non-trivial\ntopology in the quotient, as is also clear in our example: turning on the FI term produces\na bundle over IP1 (the \"small resolution\" of the conifold). We will make a related precise\nstatement in the next subsection, which we will use to justify associating the tautological\nline bundles with U (1)'s coming with non-zero FI terms and thus with nodes in the original\nquiver.\n4.1. A concise presentation\nWe describe the variety of commuting matrices Z in terms of its lattice of monomials\nM , and the positive cone M+ within that lattice. The lattice M is given as the quotient\nbt\nR\nKt\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192R \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192Zd|\u0393| \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u21920\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere R is the lattice of relations corresponding to the F-flatness constraints.

Here c is the number of generators of the\ndual cone N+ \u2282 N = Hom(M, Z). In this case, the generators of N+ correspond to c\nhomogeneous variables and we have d + |\u0393| \u2212 1 relations generating the charge lattice.\nThis data can be conveniently summarized in an exact sequence\nQt\nT\n0 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192Zc \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192N \u2212\u2212\u2212\u21920\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere S is the lattice of charges. T is a (d + |\u0393| \u2212 1) \u00d7 c matrix whose column vectors\ngenerate N+ . Q is the transpose of the kernel of T .\nAt the next stage, we have to solve for D-flatness constraints, which is equivalent to\ntaking a symplectic quotient of Z by the effective gauge group G of the quiver. Note that\n15\n\n\fthe diagonal U (1) is ungauged, therefore we have G = U (1)|\u0393|\u22121 . The action of G on\nthe monomials can be represented as a linear map \u2206 : Zd|\u0393| \u2192 Z|\u0393|\u22121 assigning to each\nmonomial a vector of charges.

It is known\nthat each such generator corresponds to a Weil divisor class on X ([18] 3.4 or [8] section\n16\n\n\f2); the basic idea is that (4.4) is dual to the exact sequence expressing divisor classes as\ndivisors (rays in N+ ) modulo functions (elements of M ).\nSince these U (1) gauge groups are labeled by a choice of \u0393 irrep, this construction produces a canonical divisor class for each irrep. This will be our definition of the tautological\nline bundles Rk .\nThe question of whether these divisors actually correspond to line bundles (live in\nPic(X)) a priori depends on the particular FI terms and subdivision of the toric fan which\nwe take. We will check this explicitly for our example; a more general treatment might\nuse the methods of [1].\n4.2. Limitations of the method\nAs we discussed in section 3, the identification of the dual bases with actual K theory\nclasses implicitly requires that the space X be completely resolved. It has not been proven\nthat the procedure of [16] will always produce a complete resolution, even if one exists.\nEven worse, in dimensions four and above, not all SU (n) orbifold singularities are\ncrepant (admit Calabi-Yau resolutions), and it is not clear how to define the generalized\nMcKay correspondence in these cases. This is a problem as many Gepner models construct\nCalabi-Yaus as hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces containing such singularities.\nIf the hypersurface avoids the singularity, one has a completely sensible Calabi-Yau and\ngeometrical interpretation, but the method presented here does not immediately apply. It\nis an important open problem to find a method which handles these cases.\nThere are also many cases for which this is not a problem, and we proceed to test the\nmethod for one of them.\n\n5. An example: WIP1,1,2,2,2\nIn the previous section we have proposed a general toric algorithm for determining\nthe tautological line bundles Rk on a (resolved) weighted projective space. We have also\nconjectured that the resulting line bundles Rk are K-theory generators dual to the classes\nSk corresponding to the fractional branes. Here we test this conjecture for the two parameter model WIP1,1,2,2,2 discussed in [6]. The B boundary states for this model have been\nconsidered in [25].\n17\n\n\fBefore presenting the details of the computation, some background on the geometry\nof WIP1,1,2,2,2 may be helpful. This is a singular weighted projective space whose toric\nresolution is defined by the following data [31]\nx0\ng1 (\u03bb) 1\ng2 (\u03bb) 0\n\nx1\n1\n0\n\nx2\n1\n0\n\nx3 x4\n1\n0\n\u22122 1\n\nx5\n0\n1\n\n(5.1)\n\nwith disallowed set\nF = {x0 = x1 = x2 = x3 = 0} \u222a {x4 = x5 = 0}.\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe resulting smooth toric variety will be denoted by W for simplicity. The Picard group\nPic(W ) is generated by two divisors H, L with relations\nH 3 (H \u2212 2L) = 0,\n\nL2 = 0\n\n(5.3)\n\nand intersection numbers\nH 4 = 2,\n\nH 3 L = 1,\n\nH 2 L2 = HL3 = L4 = 0.\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurface M \u2282 W is the zero locus of a generic section of the anticanonical line bundle \u2212KW = O(4H).\nCertain details on the geometry of M will also be needed in the following [6]. For\nsimplicity, let H, L also denote the restrictions of the divisor classes to M . The meaning\nwill be clear from the context. Then we have the intersection numbers\n(H 3 )M = 8,\n\n(H 2 L)M = 4,\n\n(HL2 )M = (L3 )M = 0.\n\n(5.5)\n\nThe cone of curves on M is generated by (h, l) [6] such that\n(H * h)M = 1,\n\n(H * l)M = 0\n\n(L * h)M = 0,\n\n(L * l)M = 1.\n\n(5.6)\n\nMoreover, we have the intersection relations\n4l = (H 2 \u2212 2HL)M \u21d2 H(H 2 \u2212 2HL) = l\n4h = (HL)M \u21d2 H 2 L = h.\n18\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fFinally, the second Chern class of M is\nc2 (M ) = 56h + 24l.\n\n(5.8)\n\n5.1. Tautological line bundles\nWe start by determining the quiver moduli space and the tautological line bundles for\n5\n\nC /\u0393, where \u0393 = Z8 acts on C5 as\n(Z 1 , Z 2 , Z 3 , Z 4 , Z 5 ) \u2192 (\u03c9Z 1 , \u03c9Z 2 , \u03c9 2 Z 3 , \u03c9 2 Z 4 , \u03c9 2 Z 5 ),\n\n\u03c9=e\n\n2\u03c0i\n8\n\n.\n\n(5.9)\n\nAs discussed in section 2.3, the associated quiver theory has eight nodes labeled by\n3,4,5\n1,2\nM = 0, . . . , 7. For each node, we have five chiral multiplets XM,M\n+1 , XM,M +2 . The su-\n\nperpotential (2.2) yields eighty F-flatness conditions (4.1), out of which only twenty-eight\nare independent. We first determine the moduli space of the quiver gauge theory using\ntoric methods as explained in the previous section. Then we find similarly the tautological\nline bundles Rk .\nThe equations (4.1) can be solved in terms of the twelve independent variables\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\n1\nX01\n, X01\n, X02\n, X02\n, X05\n, X12\n, . . . , X70\n2\nXM,M\n+1 =\ni\nXM,M\n+2\n\n2\nX0,1\n1\n1 XM,M +1 ,\nX0,1\n\nM = 1, . . . , 7\n(5.10)\n\n1\n1\nX i XM,M\n+1 XM +1,M +2\n,\n= 02\n1\n1\nX01\nX12\n\ni = 3, 4, 5., M = 1, . . . , 7.\n\nWe obtain therefore twenty-eight vectors in IR12 spanning the cone of monomials M+ .

The first five columns, describe the smooth compact toric variety W discussed in the\nbeginning of the section. The last column corresponds to an extra homogeneous coordinate\nrepresenting the fiber the canonical line bundle KW .\nIn order to justify such a interpretation, we have to make sure we are in the right toric\nphase, i.e., the disallowed locus is (5.2), while p7 is allowed to vanish. This turns out to\nbe true for a suitable interpretation of the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos terms arising from the Gepner\nmodel construction. Remember that these were \u03bek = k\u03bb, where \u03bb is a string-scale (known)\nmass parameter, and the origin of the k index is set arbitrarily (as we commented, the full\nspectrum cannot in general be reproduced by a low energy supersymmetric theory).\ne with the associated FI terms can be set in canonical form [16,1] by\nThe matrix Q\n\ninvertible row operations. We record the result in appendix A. Note that the first two\nrows reproduce the charge matrix of X (5.20). The other rows can be used to eliminate\nredundant variables as explained below. If all of \u03be2 through \u03be8 are positive, each row\nfollowing the first two can be used to eliminate a unique variable (the one appearing\nwith a negative charge), resulting in (5.19). (The last row may appear problematic as \u03be7\n\nappears with the wrong sign, but if one writes out the immediately preceding moment map\nequations |pi |2 \u2212 |pi+1 |2 = \u2212\u03be, one sees that so many negative FI terms (including \u2212\u03be7 )\nhave appeared that the final variable is guaranteed to be nonzero).\nThus we have obtained the expected result-a smooth noncompact toric fivefold X\nwith vanishing canonical class.\nWe now determine in a similar fashion the tautological line bundles. The construction\nexplained in the previous section can be implemented in practice by certain simple modifications of the quiver diagram. More precisely, we will consider a different gauge theory,\nobtained from the previous one by adding an extra chiral multiplet, corresponding to an\nextra leg in the diagram. The extra leg is attached to a single node, resulting in a multiplet\n22\n\n\fcharged under the corresponding U (1) factor. Therefore we obtain eight distinct quiver\ntheories which can be labeled by the charge vector vM of the extra multiplet. Recall that\nwe have fixed the gauge group to be G = U (1)0 \u00d7 U (1)1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 U (1)6 .

We claim that the line bundles obtained this way are precisely the K-theory generators Rk introduced in section two. The precise correspondence between Rk and the\ncharge vectors vM is given by k = M + 1.\nIn order to prove this, we proceed as before. The extra multiplet \u03c8 corresponds to\n1\n1\nan extra variable which is not related to X01\n, . . . , X70\n.

The existence of\na suitable phase can be proved by a direct computation of the FI terms, as before.

Fractional branes\nThe geometric interpretation of Gepner model boundary states for Calabi\u2013Yau models\nhas been considered in [4,11,25,38]. In particular, the present two-parameter model has\nbeen studied in [25].

A straightforward computation shows that they are in\nprecise agreement with (5.35). This proves the claim.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have continued the investigation of D-branes in Gepner models and\ntheir geometric counterparts initiated in [33,4]. One of the central problems in this area is\nto find a general geometric interpretation for Gepner model B boundary states in terms of\nholomorphic objects. So far, this question has been answered in several particular models\nusing mirror symmetry techniques, but no general picture had been found.\nThe present work fills this gap by proposing a simple construction of the K theory\nelements associated to boundary states. The power of this new construction is that it\ndoes not make use of mirror symmetry results. The approach is inspired by the description of fractional branes in lower dimensional orbifold models [17,16]. In these cases, the\ngeometric interpretation of fractional branes essentially reduces to the celebrated McKay\ncorrespondence [29,34,35]. The latter establishes a duality between orbifold (equivariant)\nK theory and the K theory of the resolved space. Given the K theoretic interpretation of\nbranes [30,41], this is precisely our problem, formulated in a slightly different language.\nWe argued that our problem, although superficially different, is essentially a higher\ndimensional version of the McKay correspondence, less well studied in the mathematical\nliterature. This follows naturally from the Landau-Ginzburg orbifold description of the\nGepner model, which is a familiar point of view in the linear sigma model approach of [40].\nBy shifting perspective from the conformal field theory approach of [33] to the linear sigma\n28\n\n\fmodel, we obtain a simple and efficient description of boundary states as fractional branes\nin a C5 /\u0393 orbifold. Indeed, if we keep in mind that only quantities which are topological or\nprotected in some way should be directly computable in the UV, we can derive the Gepner\nmodel results we use, namely the N = 1 effective Lagrangian which describes combinations\nof rational boundary states, from the LG orbifold description.\nIt is well known from the work of [10,16] that orbifold boundary states are described\nby quiver gauge theories whose moduli space typically reproduces the orbifold resolution.\nMoreover, in this picture, one can naturally define a preferred set of K theory generators\nof the resolution \u2013 the tautological line bundles Rk [26,28,23]. These are dual to another\nset of K theory generators Sk supported on the compact exceptional locus of the blownup\nsingularity. For C5 /\u0393 orbifolds, the resolved space is a noncompact Calabi-Yau variety\nisomorphic to the total space of the canonical line bundle of a weighted projective space.\nThe main result of the present work establishes a direct correspondence between fractional branes and the dual set of K theory generators Sk , which can be thought of as classes\nin the K theory of the weighted projective space. This shows that the Landau-Ginzburg\norbifold is intimately related to the geometry of the ambient toric variety which contains\nthe Calabi-Yau hypersurface.\nIn practice we have developed a systematic toric algorithm for determining the tautological line bundles Rk , starting from the quiver diagram. The basis of fractional branes\nis then determined by inverting the K theoretic intersection pairing on the ambient toric\nvariety. Finally, these are restricted to the hypersurface to obtain the classes of Gepner\nmodel boundary states.\nOne surprising aspect of this is that the intersection form on the ambient variety is\ndifferent from the intersection form on the Calabi-Yau hypersurface itself, which reproduces\nthe CFT results. Although this seems to be a natural aspect of the whole picture, the\nobjects Sk defined above are not really physical, and neither is their intersection form:\nonly their restrictions to the CY manifold are physical. Nevertheless, one gets correct\nresults by working with the unphysical Sk 's. This seems to be another manifestation of\nthe decoupling between D-flatness conditions (which define the ambient toric space) and\nF-flatness conditions (which define the CY), but remains somewhat mysterious.\nWe feel that the ideas presented here are the beginnings of a satisfactory picture both\nof the world-sheet and space-time interpretations of the rational boundary states, but\nthere is much work still to do in this direction. It would be very useful to further develop\nthe linear sigma model technology and complete the computations of all the \"topological\"\n29\n\n\fresults: spectrum, superpotentials, and D-flatness conditions. The conditions under which\na low energy theory treatment of bound states of branes is valid, and what must replace\nit in general, remain to be explored.\nThe central point for further development is that, as is clear from [23,3] and the other\nreferences, the generalized McKay correspondence can be used not just to compute K theory classes but to determine explicit holomorphic objects (sheaves or complexes of sheaves)\nrepresenting the fractional branes. Let us recall what appears to be the central lesson of\n[15]: the detailed N = 1 world-volume theories describing combinations and bound states\nof fractional branes on a CY, have a direct correspondence to natural mathematical constructions of stable holomorphic objects. For C3 /Z3 , the core of this was the identification\nof Beilinson's construction of sheaves on IP2 within the Z3 quiver gauge theory. It is\nprecisely this identification which is generalized in the works [23,3].\nThus, we can hope to generalize this lesson to fairly general CY's. The simple conjecture (an oversimplification, in ways described in detail in [15,13] and elsewhere) which\ncan guide further developments is that moduli spaces of N = 1 theories describing bound\nstates of fractional branes naturally correspond to moduli spaces of stable coherent sheaves\non the CY, and furthermore the internal structure (F and D flatness conditions) of these\ntheories corresponds to natural mathematical descriptions of the moduli space. If so, the\nconstructions we described could then eventually lead to a construction of all sheaves on\na CY which can be obtained by restriction from the ambient toric variety and then deformation. This is a sublattice of finite index in the K-theory of the CY (for example the D0\ndid not appear on the quintic) but still gives a very large subset of the possibilities.\nThe most interesting physical application of these results may be to constructing\ntype I compactifications on Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, by finding combinations of branes and\norientifolds which cancel tadpoles and anomalies, and finding the supersymmetric vacua\nof these theories. A geometric study of type I-heterotic duality should then be possible;\nindeed the C3 /\u0393 results should already be quite useful for this purpose. A natural next\nstep for both flat space and Landau\u2013Ginzburg orbifolds would be to show that the tadpole\ncancellation conditions are equivalent to the familiar anomaly cancellation conditions for\nheterotic strings on the corresponding bundles.\nWe would like to thank S.
