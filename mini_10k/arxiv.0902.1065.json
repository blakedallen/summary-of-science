We prove that the boundary of a component U of the basin of an attracting\nperiodic cycle (of period greater than 1) for an exponential map on the complex plane\nhas Hausdorff dimension greater than 1 and less than 2.

Introduction\nLet\nf (z) = \u03bb exp(z)\nfor \u03bb \u2208 C \\ {0}, z \u2208 C be an exponential map with an attracting periodic cycle of period\np. Then the Julia set J(f ) is equal to the boundary of the (entire) basin B of attraction to\nthis cycle. We are interested in dimension properties of this boundary. We consider also\nthe escaping set\nI(f ) = {z \u2208 C : f n (z) \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e}\nand the set of points in the Julia set with bounded forward trajectories\nJbd (f ) = {z \u2208 J(f ) : {f n (z)}\u221e\nn=0 is bounded}.\n\nIn our context, both set are contained in the boundary of B.\nIn the well-known case p = 1, the attracting basin consists of a unique simply connected\ncomponent U. As proved in [11], the Hausdorff dimension dimH of its boundary \u2202U = J(f )\nis then equal to 2. In fact, it follows from the proof in [11] that dimH (\u2202U) = dimH (\u2202U \u2229\nI(f )) = 2. On the other hand, we have 1 < dimH (\u2202U \u2229 Jbd (f )) \u2264 dimH (\u2202U \\ I(f )) < 2\n(see [8, 15]). A refined analysis of the dimension of subsets of I(f ) according to the speed\nof convergence to \u221e can be found in [10]. Hence, it follows from the above results that in\nthe case p = 1 the dimension of \u2202U is carried by the set of escaping points.\nConsider now the case p > 1. Then the basin B of the attracting cycle consists of\ninfinitely many disjoint simply connected components. Again, the Hausdorff dimension\nof the boundary of B is equal to 2 (see [11]).

In fact, in this paper we\nprove the following theorem.\nTheorem A. Let p > 1 and let U be a component of the basin of the attracting cycle for\nthe map f . Then the boundary of U has Hausdorff dimension greater than 1 and less than\n2.\nThis shows that for p > 1 the dimension of \u2202U is carried by points in the Julia set, which\nare not in the boundary of any component of the Fatou set (so-called buried points). By\nTheorem A, we immediately obtain:\nCorollary A'. If p > 1, then the set of buried points for the map f has Hausdorff dimension 2.\nSurprisingly, for p > 1 the role of escaping and non-escaping points in \u2202U from dimensional point of view is quite different than in the case p = 1. This is shown in the second\nresult proved in this paper.\nTheorem B. If p > 1 and U is a component of the basin of the attracting cycle for the\nmap f , then\nwhile\n\n1 < dimH (\u2202U \u2229 Jbd (f )) \u2264 dimH (\u2202U \\ I(f )) = dimH (\u2202U) < 2,\ndimH (\u2202U \u2229 I(f )) = 1.\n\nRemark. In fact, the proof of Theorem B shows that \u2202U \u2229Jbd (f ) has hyperbolic dimension\ngreater than 1.\nTherefore, in the case p > 1 the dimension of \u2202U is carried by the set of non-escaping\npoints.\nRemark. It is easy to check that for z \u2208 \u2202U we have\n\nf n (z) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u221e \u21d0\u21d2 f np (z) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(see Lemma 7).\nRecall that J(f ) consists of so-called hairs homeomorphic to [0, \u221e), tending to \u221e,\ncomposed of points with given symbolic itineraries. All points from a hair outside its\nendpoint (the point corresponding to 0 in [0, \u221e)) are contained in I(f ). In the case p = 1\nthe hairs are pairwise disjoint and the Julia set is homeomorphic to a so-called straight\nbrush (see [1]), while in the case p > 1 some hairs have common endpoints and the Julia set\nis a modified straight brush (see [5]). In both cases the Hausdorff dimension of the union\nof hairs without endpoints is equal to 1 (see [9, 13]). Hence, the hairs without endpoints\nare insignificant from dimensional point of view.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we describe combinatorics of exponential maps with a periodic basin of attraction and provide a symbolic description of the\nboundaries of its components (Proposition 3). Then, in Section 3 we prove that the set of\nescaping points in the boundary U has Hausdorff dimension 1. In Section 4 it is shown that\n\n\fDIMENSION PROPERTIES OF THE BOUNDARIES OF EXPONENTIAL BASINS\n\n3\n\nthe set of points in the boundary of U with bounded trajectories has hyperbolic dimension\ngreater than 1. Finally, Section 5 concludes the proof.\n2. Combinatorics of exponentials with attracting periodic basins\nThe combinatorics of the Julia sets of exponential maps with an attracting periodic cycle\nof period p > 1 was described in [4, 5]. For completeness, we briefly recall the construction\nfrom these papers.\nLet z0 , . . . , zp = z0 be the attracting cycle and let U0 , . . . , Up = U0 be the components\nof the basin of attraction, such that zj \u2208 Uj . Of course, we have f p (Uj ) \u2282 Uj . All Uj\nare simply connected (see e.g. [2]). Since 0 is the only singular value of f , it must be in\na component containing some zj , so we can assume 0 \u2208 U1 . It is easy to find a simply\nconnected domain Bp+1 \u2282 U1 such that 0, z1 \u2208 Bp+1 , \u2202Bp+1 is a Jordan curve in U1 and\nf p (Bp+1 ) \u2282 Bp+1 . Let Bp = f \u22121 (Bp+1 ). Then Bp is simply connected, contains some\nleft-half plane and \u2202Bp is a curve homeomorphic to the real line, contained in {z \u2208 C :\na < Re(z) < b} for some a, b \u2208 R. This curve is periodic of period 2\u03c0i and its two \"ends\"\nhave imaginary parts tending respectively to \u00b1\u221e.\nFor j = p \u2212 1, . . . , 0 define successively Bj to be the component of f \u22121 (Bj+1 ) containing\nzj . The construction implies that f maps univalently Bj onto Bj+1 for j = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1,\nsuch that B1 \u2283 Bp+1 , and f on B0 = f \u22121 (B1 ) is a universal covering of B1 \\ {0}.\nLet Cp \u2282 Bp be a domain containing z0 and some left half-plane {z : Re(z) < c}, such\nthat \u2202Cp is a curve homeomorphic to the real line, its two \"ends\" have imaginary parts\ntending to \u00b1\u221e, moreover \u2202Cp coincides with \u2202Bp on {z : |Im(z)| < L1 } and is vertical on\n{z : |Im(z)| > L2 } for some large constants L1 , L2 > 0.\nDefine successively Cj \u2282 Bj to be the component of f \u22121 (Cj+1) containing zj for j =\np \u2212 1, . . . , 0. Again, f maps univalently Cj onto Cj+1 and f on C0 = f \u22121 (C1 ) is a universal\ncovering of C1 \\ {0}. Moreover, since Bp+1 is compact, we have Bp+1 \u2282 C1 if the constant\nL1 is chosen sufficiently large. This implies\nCj \u2282 Uj\n\nfor j = 0, . . . , p \u2212 1\n\nand\n\nCp \u2282 C0 .\n\nIn particular, C0 , . . . , Cp\u22121 are pairwise disjoint. Since C0 contains some left half-plane\nand 0 \u2208\n/ C0 , the set C \\ C0 consists of infinitely many disjoint simply connected, closed,\nconnected sets Hs , s \u2208 Z, such that\n(1)\n\nHs = H0 + 2\u03c0is\n\nSimilarly, for j = 1, . . . , p \u2212 1 the set C j is a simply connected, closed, connected subset of\nS\ns Hs , such that\n(2)\n\nzj \u2208 Cj \u2282 Uj \u2282 Hkj\n\nfor j = 1, . . . p \u2212 1,\n\nfor some kj \u2208 Z.

For s \u2208 Z, j = 1, . . . , p\u22121, we have \u2202Hs = \u0393s , \u2202Cj = \u03b3j , where \u0393s , \u03b3j : R \u2192 C\nare curves homeomorphic to the real line, such that\nRe(\u0393s (t)), Re(\u03b3j (t)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nMoreover, for sufficiently large M > 0, in the right half-plane {z : Re(z) \u2265 M} the curves\n\u0393s , \u03b3j form pairs of the graphs of smooth functions y = Hs\u00b1 (x), y = h\u00b1\nj (x), x \u2265 M, where\n(x, y) are Euclidean coordinates on the plane and\nlim Hs\u00b1 (x) = (2s + 1 \u00b1 1)\u03c0 \u2212 Arg(\u03bb),\n\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim h\u00b1\np\u22121 (x) = (2kp\u22121 + 1 \u00b1 1/2)\u03c0 \u2212 Arg(\u03bb),\n\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nlim h\u00b1\nj (x) = 2\u03c0kj \u2212 Arg(\u03bb) for j = 1, . . . , p \u2212 2\n\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nfor some branch of argument.

By construction, \u03b3p\u22121 \u2229 {z : Re(z) \u2265 M} for large M is a pair of curves, which are\nimages of vertical half-lines under some branch of logarithm. Hence, these curves are the\n\u00b1\ngraphs of some smooth functions h\u00b1\np\u22121 (x), such that limx\u2192+\u221e hp\u22121 (x) = (2kp\u22121 +1\u00b11/2)\u03c0\u2212\n\n\fDIMENSION PROPERTIES OF THE BOUNDARIES OF EXPONENTIAL BASINS\n\n5\n\n\u2032\nArg(\u03bb) and |(h\u00b1\np\u22121 ) | < \u03b5 for a small \u03b5 > 0. Moreover, the curves \u03b3j , j = p \u2212 2, . . . , 1 and\n\u0393s are successive images of \u03b3p\u22121 under inverse branches of f , which have the form log(z/\u03bb)\nfor some branch of logarithm. Note also that | Arg(z)|, | Arg(log\u2032 (z/\u03bb))| < \u03b5 for every\nS\nz \u2208 p\u22121\nj=1 \u03b3j , provided Re(z) \u2265 M for large M. This easily implies that \u03b3j and \u0393s on some\nright-half plane are pairs of smooth curves with almost horizontal tangent vector and the\nrequired asymptotics.\n\u0003\n\nSince C \\ C1 is simply connected and does not contain 0, we can define branches of f \u22121 ,\ngs : C \\ C1 \u2192 Hs ,\nmapping C \\ C1 onto Hs .

We do not give a precise symbolic characterisation of the\nboundary, but provide a necessary and a sufficient conditions, which is enough for our\npurposes. To fix notation, we consider the component U0 .\nLet\n\u03a3k = {(s0 , k, s1 , k, . . .) : s0 , s1 , . . . \u2208 Z},\n\n/ {k1 , . . . , kp\u22121 } for infinitely many n}.\n\u03a3\u2032k = {(s0 , k, s1 , k, . . .) : s0 , s1 , . . . \u2208 Z and sn \u2208\n\nProposition 3.\n{z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3\u2032k } \u2282 \u2202U0 \u2282 {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3k }.\nProof. First, we show \u2202U0 \u2282 {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3k }. Take z \u2208 \u2202U0 and n \u2265 0.\nWe need to check that f n (z) \u2208 Hkj if n = lp + j for an integer l and j \u2208 {1, . . . , p \u2212 1}. It is\nclear that f lp+j (z) \u2208 \u2202Uj . Moreover, Uj must be contained in Hkj , since it is a connected\nS\nsubset of s Hs containing zj \u2208 Cj \u2282 Hkj . This shows f lp+j (z) \u2208 Hkj .\nNow we show {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3\u2032k } \u2282 \u2202U0 . Take a point z \u2208 J(f ) with\nitinerary in \u03a3\u2032k . By definition, there are arbitrarily large n such that f np (z) \u2208 Hsn and\nsn 6= kj for j \u2208 {1, . . . , p \u2212 1}. This implies that for these n we have Hsn \u2282 L. Let In\nbe a open vertical segment in Hsn containing f np (z), such that both endpoints of In are\nin \u2202Hsn . Note that the length of In is less than 2\u03c0 because of (1). Let Gn be the branch\nof f \u2212np along the trajectory of z, i.e. Gn = Gs0 ,k \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 Gsn\u22121 ,k . Since In \u2282 Hsn \u2282 L,\nthe branch Gn is defined on In . By Lemma 2, the length of Gn (In ) tends to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nMoreover, by the definition of the sets Cj , each map Gsl ,k maps points from U0 to points\nfrom U0 . Hence, the endpoints of the curve Gn (In ) are in U0 . Since z \u2208 Gn (In ), this shows\nz \u2208 \u2202U0 .\n\u0003\n3. Escaping points in the boundary\nIn this section we prove:\nProposition 4. The Hausdorff dimension of the set\n{z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3k } \u2229 I(f )\nis equal to 1.\nIn the proof of this proposition, it is more convenient to consider the set\n\u03a3\u0303k = {(k, s1 , k, s2 , . . .) : s1 , s2 , . . . \u2208 Z}\n\ninstead of \u03a3k . Note that the set {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3k } \u2229 I(f ) is a countable\nunion of the images of {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3\u0303k } \u2229 I(f ) under inverse branches of\nf , so both sets have the same Hausdorff dimension. Hence, to prove Proposition 4, it is\nsufficient to show that\n(3)\n\ndimH ({z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3\u0303k } \u2229 I(f )) = 1.\n\n\fDIMENSION PROPERTIES OF THE BOUNDARIES OF EXPONENTIAL BASINS\n\n7\n\nLet\nfor a large integer M > 0 and\n\nWM = {z : Re(z) \u2265 M}\n\nAM = {z \u2208 J(f ) : z has itinerary in \u03a3\u0303k and f n (z) \u2208 WM for all n \u2265 0}.\n\nThe assertion (3) will follow immediately from\n\nProposition 5. For every \u03b4 > 0 there exists M(\u03b4) > 0 such that for every M > M(\u03b4),\ndimH AM < 1 + \u03b4.\nThe rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 5.\nDefinition.

Since\n[\nK0 ,\nL \u2229 Hk1 \u2229 WM =\nK0 \u2208K0\n\nthis implies that the collection Kn is a cover of AM .\nFix \u03b4 > 0.

The basic idea of the proof is to construct a finite conformal Iterated Function\nSystem with a compact Cantor repeller X contained in the considered set, such that\nf 2p (X) = X, and to use classical Bowen's formula to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of\nX. In fact, it is a modification of the proof from [3]. For completeness, we present the\nmain ideas of the proof.\nLet R be a large positive real number.

Moreover, diam Q = 2R and dist(Q, \u2202L) > R/2 \u2212 D for\nsome constant D > 0. Hence, by the Koebe Lemma (see e.g. [7]), the distortion of these\nbranches on Q is bounded by a constant independent of R, u, s.\nLet\nQu,s = Gu,k \u25e6 Gs,k (Q)\nfor u, s \u2208 Z and\n\nG = {(u, s) \u2208 Z2 : Qu,s \u2282 Q}.\n\n\f10\n\nKRZYSZTOF BARA\u0143SKI, BOGUSLAWA KARPI\u0143SKA, AND ANNA ZDUNIK\n\nNow define\nX=\n\n\u221e\n\\\n[\n\nn=1 i1 ,...,in\n\nhi1 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 hin (Q),\n\nwhere hij = Gu,k \u25e6 Gs,k for some (u, s) \u2208 G.
