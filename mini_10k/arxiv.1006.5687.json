We describe which topological spaces can arise as the prime spectrum of a commutative monoid,\nin the spirit of Hochster's and Brenner's theses.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. In this note, all monoids are commutative and the unit element of a monoid M is written as 1.\nAssociated to a commutative monoid is a space called the prime spectrum. We will refer to it as the Kato\nspectrum in order to avoid confusion with the prime spectrum of a commutative ring.\nDefinition. Let M be a monoid. A subset I \u2282 M is called an ideal if for all x \u2208 I and m \u2208 M , we have\nxm \u2208 I. An ideal p is prime if M \\ p is a submonoid of M (in particular, 1 \u2208 M \\ p.)\nWe define spec(M ) to be the set of all prime ideals of M . For f \u2208 M , we define\nD(f ) = {p \u2208 spec(M ) : f \u2208\n/ p}.\nThe Kato spectrum of M is the set spec(M ) with the topology with a base given by the D(f ).\nThe Kato spectrum can also be equipped with a sheaf of monoids, but in this paper we are concerned\nonly with the underlying space.\n1.2. The notion of prime ideal in a commutative semigroup goes \"back to antiquity\" according to [Gri01].\nThe Zariski topology on the set of prime ideals goes back at least to Kist [Kis63]. The Kato spectrum\nwas introduced by Kato [Kat94] in the study of toric singularities. It was later used by Deitmar [Dei05] to\nconstruct a theory of \"schemes over the field with one element\".\nIf R is a commutative ring and M denotes the underlying multiplicative monoid (R, *) of R then spec(M )\nis the set of unions of prime ideals of R. This space has appeared in some constructions of spaces associated\nfunctorially to an arbitrary ring. See [Ary10] and references therein.\n1.3. The aim of the present paper is to prove an analogue of the following theorem of Hochster. In this\npaper, we say a topological space X is compact if every open cover of X has a finite subcover (in algebraic\ngeometry, this is often called quasi-compactness.)\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20M32,54H12.\n1\n\n\fTheorem. [Hoc69] A topological space X is homeomorphic to Spec(R) for some commutative ring R if and\nonly if the following three properties hold.\n\u2022 X is T0 .\n\u2022 The set of open compact subsets of X is a base of X which contains X and is closed under finite\nintersections.\n\u2022 Every irreducible closed subset of X is the closure of a unique point.\nTheorem 1.3 is useful in constructing examples of affine schemes whose underlying spaces behave pathologically. It also began the study of spectral spaces.\n1.4. Various authors have generalized Hochster's Theorem to other kinds of spectrum. For example,\nHochster [Hoc71] proved an analogue of the theorem with Spec replaced by the set of minimal prime ideals of\na ring and Echi [Ech00] proved an analogue for the Goldman spectrum of a ring. Also, Kist [Kis63] studied\ntopological properties of the space of minimal prime ideals in a commutative semigroup. Brenner [Bre94]\nproved the following analogue of Hochster's Theorem for monoids.\nDefinition. Let X be a topological space. A subset A \u2282 X is called a blob if there exists a \u2208 X such that\nA is the intersection of all open subsets of X which contain a.\nTheorem. [Bre94, Satz 2.3.2] A topological space X is homeomorphic to spec(M ) for some commutative\nmonoid M if and only if the following properties hold\n\u2022 X is T0 .\n\u2022 The set of open blobs of X is a base of X which contains X and is closed under finite intersections.\n\u2022 Every intersection of irreducible closed subsets of X is the closure of a unique point.\nand X also satisfies (\u2217) where\n(\u2217) If {U\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} is a collection of open blobs in X and U is an open set\nwith\n\n\\\n\nU\u03bb \u2282 U, then there exist \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 \u039b with\n\nn\n\\\n\nU\u03bbi \u2282 U.\n\ni=1\n\n\u03bb\n\n1.5. In this note, we will show that the first three properties in Theorem 1.4 may be expressed by saying\nthat X possesses a certain algebraic structure, essentially coming from the fact that the set of prime ideals\nof a monoid is closed under union. This yields a nice description of those spaces which can be the prime\nspectrum of a finitely-generated monoid. See Corollary 4.3.\n1.6. Schemes over F1 . Vezzani [Vez10] has recently shown that Deitmar's definition of a scheme over F1\nis equivalent to another definition due to To\u00ebn and Vaiqu\u00e9 [TV09], in which schemes are constructed by\nglueing together objects of the opposite of the category of monoids via a general construction which mimics\n(and generalizes) the usual definition of a scheme. See [JLP09, Section 1.2] for a fuller description of this.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.4 may therefore be useful in understanding the nature of the spaces which play the role of affine\nschemes over F1 in these theories.\n2. Exponentiation\n2.1. In this section, we characterize those spaces which satisfy the first three conditions of Theorem 1.4, in\norder to understand how the condition (\u2217) fits in.\nDefinition. A poset (P, \u2264) is called a join semilattice if every pair of elements x, y \u2208 P has a least upper\nbound sup{x, y} \u2208 P . A join semilattice P is complete if every A \u2282 P has a least upper bound sup(A) \u2208 P .\nBy definition, a map f : (P, \u2264P ) \u2192 (Q, \u2264Q ) of complete join semilattices is an order-preserving function\nwhich also satisfies f (sup(A)) = sup(f (A)) for all A \u2282 P .\nDefinition. Let X be a topological space. We call a base B of open sets of X monoidal if X \u2208 B and B is\nclosed under finite intersections.\n2.2. We define a category M as follows. Objects of M are pairs (X, B) where X is a T0 space and B is a\nmonoidal base of X. A morphism (X, B) \u2192 (Y, C) is a function f : X \u2192 Y such that f \u22121 (U ) \u2208 B for all\nU \u2208 C.\nDefinition. We call an object (X, B) of M an M\u2013complete join semilattice if there is a partial order \u2264 on\nX such that (X, \u2264) is a complete join semilattice, and such that for all A \u2282 X and all U \u2208 B, we have\nA \u2282 U \u21d0\u21d2 sup(A) \u2208 U.\nA morphism of M\u2013complete join semilattices is a morphism in M which is also a map of complete joinsemilattices (ie. preserves suprema.)\n2.3. Recall that the specialization order \u2264 on a T0 space X is defined by x \u2264 y if and only if for all open\nsets U , y \u2208 U =\u21d2 x \u2208 U . Alternatively, x \u2264 y if and only if y \u2208 {x}. One can check that if the partial\norder \u2264 makes (X, B) into an M\u2013complete join semilattice, then in fact \u2264 must be the specialization order.\nExample. Let M be a commutative monoid. Let X = spec(M ) and let B = {D(f ) : f \u2208 M }, a monoidal\nbase of X. Define a partial order on X by p \u2264 q if and only if p \u2282 q. Then (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join\nS\nsemilattice, because if A \u2282 X, we may take sup(A) = p\u2208A p, which is a prime ideal of M .\nWe aim to show that each object (X, B) of M can be completed to an M\u2013complete join semilattice.\n2.4. The exponential. We define a functor E : M \u2192 M as follows. Let (X, B) be an object of M. Let\nP(X) be the power set of X. Let B0 = {P(U ) : U \u2208 B}. Then B0 is a base for a topology on P(X). The\nresulting topological space P(X) may not be T0 , but we define an equivalence relation on P(X) by A \u223c B\nif and only if A and B belong to the same open sets of P(X).\n3\n\n\fDefinition. The exponential E(X, B) is the quotient space P(X)/ \u223c equipped with the monoidal base\ne = {U\ne : U \u2208 B} where for U \u2208 B, we define\nB\ne = {[A] \u2208 P(X)/ \u223c such that A \u2282 U }.\nU\nHere, we write [A] for the equivalence class in P(X)/ \u223c of A \u2208 P(X).\nExample. Let X = {x} be a one-point space. Let B = {\u2205, X}, a monoidal base of X. Then P(X) = {\u2205, X}\nwith base {{\u2205}, P(X)}. This space is T0 , and so E(X, B) = P(X) is the two-point Sierpinski space. If we\nhad taken the base B \u2032 = {X} instead, we would get E(X, B \u2032 ) \u223c\n= (X, B \u2032 ). Thus, E(X, B) depends on the\nchoice of the base B.\n2.5. The following example was the original motivation for defining E.\nExample. Let R be a commutative ring and let X = Spec(R). For f \u2208 R, let D(f ) = {p \u2208 Spec(R) : f \u2208\n/ p}.\nLet B be the base of X consisting of all the D(f ). Let M = (R, *) be the underlying multiplicative monoid\nof R. Then E(X, B) \u223c\n= spec(M ).\n2.6. It is easy to see that E : M \u2192 M is a functor and that if (X, B) is an object of M then there is a\nmap i = i(X,B) : (X, B) \u2192 E(X, B) defined by i(x) = [{x}], the equivalence class of the singleton {x}. The\nmap i(X,B) is injective and its image is dense in E(X, B) \\ {[\u2205]}. The i(X,B) define a natural transformation\nid \u2192 E of functors M \u2192 M.\n2.7. If (X, B) is an object of M then E(X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice under the specialization\norder. Indeed, the reader can check that if A\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b are subsets of X, then the supremum of {[A\u03bb ] : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b}\n\u0003\n\u0002S\nis\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b A\u03bb .\n2.8. We now show that E(X, B) is the smallest M\u2013complete join semilattice which contains (X, B).\nProposition. Let (X, B) be an object of M.\nThe natural map i : (X, B) \u2192 E(X, B) is the universal map from (X, B) to an M\u2013complete join-semilattice\nin the following sense:\nIf \u03b8 : (X, B) \u2192 (Y, C) is a map in M and (Y, C) is an M\u2013complete join-semilattice, then there exists a\nunique map of M\u2013complete join semilattices \u03b8b : E(X, B) \u2192 (Y, C) such that the following diagram commutes.\n\u03b8\n\n// (Y, C)\n::\nt\nt\ntt\nt\ni\ntt\n\u000f\u000f tt \u03b8b\nE(X, B)\n(X, B)\n\nb\nProof. The map \u03b8b is defined by \u03b8([A])\n= sup(\u03b8(A)) for all A \u2282 X. It is routine to check that \u03b8b is the unique\nmorphism of M\u2013complete join semilattices which makes the diagram commute.\n4\n\n\u0003\n\n\f2.9. We have the following corollary of Proposition 2.8.\nCorollary. E 2 = E as functors M \u2192 M.\nProof. This follows directly from Proposition 2.8 if we note that if (X, B) and (Y, C) are M\u2013complete join\nsemilattices and f : (X, B) \u2192 (Y, C) is a morphism in M, then f necessarily preserves suprema.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.10. Now we give a topological characterization of which spaces can arise as E(X, B) for some (X, B).\nFirst, we need the following Lemma.\nLemma. Let (X, B) be an M\u2013complete join semilattice. Let U \u2282 X be open. Then U is a blob (see Definition\n1.4) if and only if U \u2208 B.\nProof. Suppose U \u2282 X is an open blob. Then there exist U\u03bb \u2208 B with U =\n\nS\n\n\u03bb\n\nU\u03bb because B is a base for\n\nthe topology on X. Since U is a blob, there exists a \u2208 X such that U is the intersection of all the open\nsets which contain a. Therefore, a \u2208 U\u03bb for some \u03bb, and so U \u2282 U\u03bb . So U = U\u03bb \u2208 B. Conversely, suppose\nU \u2208 B. Then sup(U ) \u2208 U by Definition 2.2. Since the order \u2264 on X coincides with the specialization order\n(see Section 2.3), for all x \u2208 X we have x \u2208 U if and only if x \u2264 sup(U ). Therefore, U is the intersection of\nall the open sets which contain sup(U ), so U is a blob.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem. Let X be a T0 space. The following are equivalent.\n(1) The open blobs form a monoidal base of X, and for all A \u2282 X,\n\nT\n\nx\u2208A\n\n{x} is the closure of a point.\n\n(2) If B denotes the set of open blobs of X, then (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice.\n(3) There exists a monoidal base B of X such that (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice.\n(4) There exists a monoidal base B of X such that (X, B) \u223c\n= E(X, B) in M.\n(5) There exists a monoidal base B of X and an object (Y, C) of M such that (X, B) \u223c\n= E(Y, C) in M.\nProof. The equivalence of (3), (4) and (5) follows directly from Proposition 2.8 and Corollary 2.9. Also, (2)\ntrivially implies (3). It remains to show that (1) and (3) are equivalent.\n(1) =\u21d2 (2): Let B be the set of all open blobs of X. We claim that (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join\nsemilattice. Define \u2264 to be the specialization order on X, so that x \u2264 y if and only if y \u2208 {x}. For A \u2282 X,\nT\nthere is a point y such that a\u2208A {a} = {y}, and we see that y is the supremum of A in the ordering \u2264. So\n(X, \u2264) is a complete join-semilattice. Now let U be an open blob and A \u2282 X. We must show that A \u2282 U\nif and only if sup(A) \u2208 U . There is some a \u2208 X such that U is the intersection of all open sets containing\na. In other words, U = {x \u2208 X : x \u2264 a}. So if A \u2282 U then sup(A) \u2208 U , while if sup(A) \u2208 U then A \u2282 U\nbecause x \u2264 sup(A) \u2264 a for all x \u2208 A. Therefore, (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice.\n(3) =\u21d2 (1): Suppose (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice. By Lemma 2.10, B is precisely the set of\nT\nopen blobs, and so these form a monoidal base. Now let A \u2282 X. It is easy to check that a\u2208A {a} = {sup(A)},\nand so we are done.\n\n\u0003\n5\n\n\f3. Monoids\n3.1. In this section, we give a proof of Theorem 1.4 following [Bre94].\nProposition. Let X be a topological space. The following are equivalent.\n(1) X is homeomorphic to spec(M ) for some monoid M .\n(2) X is T0 and there is a monoidal base B of X such that (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice\nand the map\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 spec(B, \u2229)\nx 7\u2192 {U \u2208 B : x \u2208\n/ U}\nis a bijection.\nProof. Suppose X = spec(M ). Then take B = {D(f ) : f \u2208 M }. Then B is a monoidal base of X and (X, B)\nis an M\u2013complete join semilattice. The map \u03c6 : X \u2192 spec(B, \u2229) is given by p 7\u2192 {D(g) : p \u2208\n/ D(g)} =\n{D(g) : g \u2208 p}. This has an inverse given by sending a prime ideal Q of the monoid (B, \u2229) to the prime\nideal {f \u2208 M : D(f ) \u2208 Q} of M .\nConversely, suppose X has a monoidal base B and the map x 7\u2192 {U \u2208 B : x \u2208\n/ U } is bijective. We need\nonly show that this map is in fact a homeomorphism. This follows from [Kis63, Lemma 4.3]. Alternatively,\nT\nwe may define a function \u03b8 : spec(B, \u2229) \u2192 X by \u03b8(p) = sup( U\u2208B\\p U ). Then for all V \u2208 B and x \u2208 X,\n\u03b8\u03c6(x) = \u03b8({U \u2208 B : x \u2208\n/ U }) \u2208 V if and only if x \u2208 V . Therefore, \u03b8\u03c6(x) = x since X is T0 . So \u03b8 is a\none-sided inverse to \u03c6, and therefore \u03b8 is inverse to \u03c6 since \u03c6 is a bijection. To show that \u03b8 is continuous,\nobserve that \u03c6 is an open map because for V \u2208 B, \u03c6(V ) = {p \u2208 spec(B, \u2229) : V \u2208\n/ p}.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.2.\nProposition. Let X be a topological space. The following are equivalent.\n(1) X is homeomorphic to spec(M ) for some monoid M .\n(2) X is T0 and there is a monoidal base B of X such that (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice\nand the condition (\u2217) of Theorem 1.4 holds for X.\nProof. Suppose X is homeomorphic to spec(M ). Then X is T0 . Let B = {D(f ) : f \u2208 M }, a monoidal base\nof X. By Example 2.3, (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice. By Lemma 2.10, the open blobs of X are\nprecisely the elements of B. Suppose U\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, are open blobs. Then\np = {U \u2208 B : U does not contain any finite intersection of the U\u03bb }\nis a prime ideal of the monoid (B, \u2229). By the proof of Proposition 3.1, there exists x \u2208 M such that\nTn\np = {U \u2208 B : x \u2208\n/ U }. In other words, for any U \u2208 B, x \u2208 U if and only if U contains some i=1 U\u03bbi . In\nT\nT\nparticular, x \u2208 U\u03bb for all \u03bb and so x \u2208 \u03bb U\u03bb . Suppose U is an open set and U \u2283 \u03bb U\u03bb . Then x \u2208 U and\n6\n\n\fso x is contained in some open blob U \u2032 \u2282 U , since the open blobs are a base. So U \u2032 \u2282 U contains some finite\nintersection of the U\u03bb . Thus, (\u2217) holds.\nConversely, if X satisfies (2), then by Proposition 3.1, we just need to show that the function \u03c6 : X \u2192\nspec(B, \u2229) defined by \u03c6(x) = {U : x \u2208\n/ U } is a bijection. We define \u03b8 : spec(B, \u2229) \u2192 X by \u03b8(p) =\nT\nsup( W \u2208B\\p W ). We have seen in the proof of Proposition 3.1 that \u03b8\u03c6 is the identity, so we need to show\nT\nthat if p is a prime ideal of (B, \u2229), then \u03c6\u03b8(p) = p. We have \u03c6\u03b8(p) = {U \u2208 B : U + W \u2208B\\p W }. Thus, for\nT\nV \u2208 B, we see that V \u2208\n/ \u03c6\u03b8(p) if and only if V \u2283 W \u2208B\\p W . By (\u2217) combined with Lemma 2.10, this holds\nTn\nif and only if there are W1 , . . . , Wn \u2208\n/ p with V \u2283 i=1 Wi . Since p is a prime ideal, this holds if and only if\nV \u2208\n/ p. Thus, \u03c6\u03b8(p) = p as required.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.3. We can also prove directly from the definition of spec(M ) that spec(M ) satisfies the condition (\u2217) of\nT\nTheorem 1.4. This can be done by first reducing to the case of an inclusion of basic open sets \u03bb\u2208\u039b D(f\u03bb ) \u2282\nD(g) and then considering the prime ideal p = M \\ q where\nq = {h \u2208 M : \u2203t \u2208 M, \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 \u039b, k1 , . . . , kn \u2265 0 with th = f\u03bbk11 * * * f\u03bbknn }.\nThe details are left as an exercise.\n3.4. We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.4. We use the following lemma.\nLemma. Let M be a monoid. Then every irreducible closed subset of X = spec(M ) is the closure of a point.\nProof. This is like the analogous fact from algebraic geometry. By [Vez10, Section 2], every closed subset of\nX has the form V (I) = {p : p \u2283 I} where I is an intersection of prime ideals of M . If V (I) is irreducible\nand x, y \u2208\n/ I, then V (I) \u2229 D(x) 6= \u2205 and V (I) \u2229 D(y) 6= \u2205, and so V (I) \u2229 D(x) \u2229 D(y) = V (I) \u2229 D(xy) 6= \u2205\nby irreducibility. Therefore, xy \u2208\n/ I and so I is prime, Similarly, if I is prime then V (I) is irreducible.\nThus, the irreducible closed sets of X are precisely the sets V (p) for p \u2208 X. But V (p) = {p}, as\nrequired.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.5. Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let X = spec(M ) for a monoid M . By Proposition 3.2, there is a monoidal\nbase of X such that (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice. By Theorem 2.10, the open blobs of X form\na monoidal base of X. By Lemma 3.4, every closed irreducible subset of X is the closure of a point. By\nTheorem 2.10 again, every intersection of closed irreducible subsets of X is the closure of a point. This point\nis unique because X is a T0 space. By Theorem 3.2, the condition (\u2217) of Theorem 1.4 holds. Thus, all the\nconditions of Theorem 1.4 are satisfied by X.\nConversely, suppose X satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1.4. Let B be the set of open blobs of X. Since\n{x} is an irreducible closed set for any x \u2208 X, condition (1) of Theorem 2.10 holds for X. By Theorem\n2.10, (X, B) is an M\u2013complete join semilattice. Since X satisfies (\u2217), we get from Proposition 3.2 that X is\nhomeomorphic to spec(M ) for some M .\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.4.\n7\n\n\f4. Remarks and applications\n4.1. The proof of Theorem 1.4 implies that if M is a monoid then spec(M ) is homeomorphic to spec(B, \u2229)\nwhere B = {D(f ) : f \u2208 M }. The monoid (B, \u2229) is known as the universal semilattice of M ([Gri01, III.1.4]).\nThus, every monoid spectrum is the spectrum of a semilattice. From this, we get a second characterization\nof monoid spectra as those spaces which can be obtained as the soberification (space of closed irreducible\nsubsets) of some meet-semilattice (P, \u2264) with greatest element, equipped with the topology whose open sets\nare the lower order ideals.\n4.2. The necessity of (\u2217). The condition (\u2217) of Theorem 1.4 is ugly-looking. However, it is not possible to\nremove it (or some equivalent condition). To see this, we must exhibit a space which satisfies the first three\nconditions of Theorem 1.4 but is not homeomorphic to spec(M ) for any monoid M . In view of Theorem\n2.10, we just need to exhibit a space (X, B) such that E(X, B) does not satisfy (\u2217).\nExample. Let X be a space with a monoidal base B such that there are Un \u2208 B with\n\nT\n\nn\u2208N\n\nUn = \u2205, but\n\nno finite intersection of the Un is empty. For example, take X = R with B the collection of all open subsets\nT f\nof R, and let Un = (0, n1 ) for n \u2208 N. Then from Definition 2.4, we see that n U\nn = {[A] \u2208 P(X)/ \u223c\nT f\nT\nfn is contained in \u2205,\ne But no finite intersection of the U\ne\nsuch that A \u2282 n Un } = {[\u2205]}. Thus, n Un \u2282 \u2205.\n\nand thus (\u2217) does not hold for E(X, B).\n\n4.3. A topological space X is artinian if every descending chain U1 \u2283 U2 \u2283 * * * of open sets terminates.\nAny artinian space (or even a space whose open blobs satisfy the descending chain condition) automatically\nsatisfies (\u2217). Combining this observation with [Kat94, Proposition 5.5], we have the following corollary of\nTheorem 1.4.\nCorollary. Let X be a topological space. The following are equivalent.\n(1) X is homeomorphic to spec(M ) for some finite monoid M .\n(2) X is homeomorphic to spec(M ) for some finitely-generated monoid M .\n(3) X is the underlying space of E(Y, B) for some finite space Y with a monoidal base B.\n4.4. Comparing Theorem 1.4 to Theorem 1.3, and noting that the compact open subsets of spec(M ) are\njust the finite unions of sets of the form D(f ), we observe that the underlying space of the Kato spectrum\nis always the underlying space of the spectrum of some commutative ring.\n4.5. Questions. Theorem 1.4 gives rise to some natural questions.\n\u2022 Is there a better way to express the condition (\u2217) of Theorem 1.4?\n\u2022 Is there a characterization of spaces of the form spec(M ) analogous to Hochster's characterization\n([Hoc69, Proposition 10]) of the underlying spaces of ring spectra as projective limits of finite T0\nspaces?\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[Ary10] M.
