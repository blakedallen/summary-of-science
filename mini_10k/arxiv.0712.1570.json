In\nparticular, we are interested in the stochastic completeness of this process and a\nprecise borderline for when the stochastic completeness breaks down. Stochastic\ncompleteness can be formulated in several equivalent ways: as a property of\nthe heat kernel, as the uniqueness of bounded solutions for the heat equation,\nor as the non-existence of bounded, non-zero, \u03bb-harmonic (or \u03bb-subharmonic)\nfunctions for a negative constant \u03bb. In studying this property, we have benefited\ntremendously from the survey article of Grigor'yan [9] which discusses, in great\ndepth, stochastic completeness in the case of Riemannian manifolds. For graphs,\nthe starting point for our work is the paper of Dodziuk and Mathai [6] where it is\nshown that any graph whose valence is uniformly bounded above by a constant\nis stochastically complete.\nIn the first part, we give a construction of the heat kernel on a general\ngraph via an exhaustion argument. This is analogous to the construction on\n\n3\n\n\fopen Riemannian manifolds and we follow the presentation given in [3]. We\nalso point out that one can construct the heat kernel by utilizing the spectral\ntheorem but the two constructions result in the same kernel [3]. Next, we\nintroduce the notion of stochastic completeness and prove the equivalence of\nthe various formulations mentioned above. This material is adapted from [9].\nWe then turn our focus to a class of trees which we call model because their\ndefinition is analogous to that of rotationally symmetric or model manifolds.\nThe defining property of these trees is that they contain a vertex x0 , which we\ncall the root for the model, such that the valence at every other vertex depends\nonly on the distance from x0 . Let m(r) denote this common number where r\ndenotes the distance from x0 . The main result of this section says that such\nP\n1\ntrees will be stochastically complete if and only if \u221e\nr=0 m(r) = \u221e. We note\n\nhere the similarity between this criterion and the one for the recurrence of the\nBrownian motion on a complete, model surface [11, 9].\n\nWe then consider general trees and prove that if a tree contains a stochastically incomplete model subtree then it must be stochastically incomplete. We\nfirst prove this in the special case when the branching of the general tree is\ngrowing rapidly in all directions from the root, then in the general case where\nthe branching is growing rapidly in just some direction. Also, we show that\nif a tree is contained in a stochastically complete model tree then it must be\nstochastically complete. The proof of this fact follows from the more general\nstatement that, for any graph G, if there exists a vertex x0 such that the maximum valence of vertices on spheres centered at x0 is not growing too rapidly\nthen G must be stochastically complete.\nNext, we prove theorems analogous to a result of Cheeger and Yau [1] which\ncompare the heat kernel on a model tree to the heat kernel on a general tree.\nLet Tn be a model tree with root vertex x0 where n(r) is m(r) \u2212 1, that is,\none less than the common valence of vertices on the sphere of radius r about\nx0 . We denote the heat kernel on Tn by \u03c1t (x0 , x) and first show that, as a\n4\n\n\ffunction of x, \u03c1t (x0 , x) only depends on the distance from x0 . That is, if we\nlet r(x) = d(x, x0 ), where d(x, x0 ) denotes the distance between x and x0 , then\nwe can write \u03c1t (r) = \u03c1t (x0 , r(x)). Let T denote a general tree with heat kernel\npt (x0 , x). Then, if the branching on T is growing faster in all directions from\nx0 then the branching on Tn , we show that pt (x0 , x) \u2264 \u03c1t (r(x)). In a similar\nfashion, if T \u2286 Tn , then \u03c1t (r(x)) \u2264 pt (x0 , x).\nWe finish this chapter by considering an operator related to the combinatorial Laplacian that we study throughout the rest of the thesis. This operator,\nreferred to here as the bounded Laplacian, arises when one assigns the standard\nweight to the edges of a graph. We show here that the heat kernel associated\nto this Laplacian is stochastically complete for every graph G. In particular,\nbounded solutions for the combinatorial heat equation involving the bounded\nLaplacian are unique.\nIn the final part of the thesis we study the spectrum of the Laplacian on\na general graph. Specifically, we introduce \u03bb0 (\u2206), the bottom of the spectrum\nof the Laplacian, and prove a characterization of it in terms of the existence of\npositive \u03bb-harmonic functions. That is, there always exist positive functions satisfying \u2206u = \u03bbu for \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb0 (\u2206) whereas such functions never exist for \u03bb > \u03bb0 (\u2206)\n[14, 4]. We then prove a lower bound on \u03bb0 (\u2206) under a geometric assumption\non G. Specifically, we assume that if we fix a vertex x0 , then at every other\nvertex x of G the ratio of the difference of the number of edges leaving x and\ngoing away from x0 and the number of edges going towards x0 divided by the\ntotal valence at x is bounded below by a positive constant. The lower bound\nis then given in terms of this constant. In the final section, we use this lower\nbound to prove that, with the additional assumption that the minimum valence\non spheres about x0 is going to infinity as one moves away from the fixed vertex,\nthe Laplacian on the graph has empty essential spectrum. This is analogous to\nthe result of Donnelly and Li for complete, simply connected, negatively curved\nRiemannian manifolds [7].\n5\n\n\f1.1.1\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Professor J\u00f3zef Dodziuk, my advisor, who has assisted\nme at every stage of my doctoral studies. Without his wisdom and patience\nmuch of this work would have not been completed. I would also like to thank\nProfessors Isaac Chavel and Leon Karp for serving on my committee and for\ntaking the time to discuss my results with me.\n\n1.2\n\nNotation and Fundamentals\n\nIn this section we fix our notation and state and prove some basic lemmas\nwhich will be used throughout. In general, G = (V, E) will denote an infinite,\nlocally finite, connected graph where V = V (G) is the set of vertices of G and\nE = E(G) the set of edges. At times, we abuse notation and write x \u2208 G when\nx is a vertex of G. We will use the notation x \u223c y to indicate that an edge\nconnects the vertices x and y while [x, y] will denote the oriented edge from\nx to y. In general, to be able to write down certain formulas, we will assume\nthat our graphs come with an orientation, that is, that every edge is oriented,\nbut none of our results depend on the choice of this orientation. We use the\nnotation m(x) to indicate the valence at a vertex x, that is, the number of edges\nemanating from x.\nFor a finite subgraph D of G, we let Vol(D) denote the volume of D which\nwe take, by definition, to be the number of vertices of D. That is,\nVol(D) = #{x | x \u2208 V (D)}.\nWe also use the usual notion of distance between two vertices of the graph.\nSpecifically, d(x, y) will denote the number of edges in the shortest path connecting the vertices x and y.\nWe call f a function on the graph G if it is a mapping f : V \u2192 R. The set\nof all such functions will be denoted by C(V ). We will also use the notation\n6\n\n\fC0 (V ) for the space of all finitely supported functions on G and l2 (V ) for the\nspace of all square summable functions. That is, l2 (V ) consists of all functions\non G which satisfy\nX\n\nx\u2208V\n\nf (x)2 < \u221e\n\nand is a Hilbert space with inner product\nhf, gi =\n\nX\n\nf (x)g(x).\n\nx\u2208V\n\nSimilarly, we let l2 (\u1ebc) denote the Hilbert space of all square summable functions on oriented edges satisfying the relation \u03c6([x, y]) = \u2212\u03c6([y, x]) with inner\nproduct\nh\u03c6, \u03c8i =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6([x, y])\u03c8([x, y])\n\n[x,y]\u2208\u1ebc\n\nwhere \u1ebc denotes the set of all oriented edges of G.\nWe now recall the definitions of the coboundary and Laplacian operators and\nstate and prove an analogue of Green's Theorem for them. The coboundary\noperator d takes a function on the vertices of G and sends it to a function on\nthe oriented edges of G defined by:\ndf ([x, y]) = f (y) \u2212 f (x).\nThe combinatorial Laplacian \u2206 operates on functions on G by the formula:\n\u2206f (x) =\n\nX\n\ny\u223cx\n\nX\n\u0001\nf (x) \u2212 f (y) = m(x)f (x) \u2212\nf (y)\n\n(1.1)\n\ny\u223cx\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all vertices y such that y \u223c x forms an edge\nin G. If the Laplacian is applied to a function of more than one variable then\nwe will put the variable in which it is applied as a subscript when necessary.\nFor a constant \u03bb, we call a function v on G \u03bb-harmonic if \u2206v(x) = \u03bbv(x) for\nall vertices x.\nNote that it follows from formula (1.1) that the Laplacian will be bounded\nif and only if there exists a constant M such that m(x) \u2264 M for all vertices x.\n7\n\n\fIndeed, letting \u03b4x denote the delta function at a vertex x so that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 if x = y\n\u03b4x (y) =\n\uf8f3 0 otherwise\n\nwe see that the matrix coefficients of the Laplacian are given by\n\u2206(x, y)\n\n=\n\n=\n\nh\u2206\u03b4x , \u03b4y i = \u2206\u03b4x (y)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 m(x) if x = y\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u22121\n\nif x \u223c y\n\n0\n\notherwise.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, under the assumption m(x) \u2264 M , all graphs\nare stochastically complete [6, Theorem 2.10]. Therefore, for the purposes of\nour inquiry, we do not impose this restriction on the graph and the Laplacian\nwill be an unbounded operator.\nLet D be a finite, connected subgraph of G. We then have the following\nanalogue of Green's Theorem.\nLemma 1.2.1.\nX\n\n\u2206f (x)g(x)\n\n=\n\nx\u2208D\n\nX\n\ndf ([x, y])dg([x, y]) +\n\nx\u2208D\nz\u223cx,z6\u2208D\n\n[x,y]\u2208\u1ebc(D)\n\n=\n\nX\n\n[x,y]\u2208\u1ebc(D)\n\nX\n\ndf ([x, y])dg([x, y]) \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u0001\nf (x) \u2212 f (z) g(x)\ndf ([x, z])g(x).\n\n[x,z]\nx\u2208D,z6\u2208D\n\nProof: Every oriented edge [x, y] with x, y \u2208 V (D) contributes two terms to\n\u0001\nthe sum on the left hand side: f (x) \u2212 f (y) g(x) from \u2206f (x)g(x) and f (y) \u2212\n\u0001\nf (x) g(y) from \u2206f (y)g(y). These add up to give\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf (y) \u2212 f (x) g(y) \u2212 g(x) = df ([x, y])dg([x, y]).\n\nThe remaining contributions come from any vertex x in D that is connected to a\n\u0001\nneighbor z which is not in D and these give f (x)\u2212 f (z) g(x) = \u2212df ([x, z])g(x).\n\n8\n\n\fWe say that a vertex x is in the boundary of D, and denote this x \u2208 \u2202D, if\nit is a vertex of D and is connected to any vertex which is not in D. Otherwise,\na vertex x of D is said to be in the interior of D, or x \u2208 int(D). We then see\nthat, if either f or g are zero on the complement of the interior of D, then the\nsecond term on the right hand side of the equation above is zero and we can\nwrite Lemma 1.2.1 as\nh\u2206f, giV (D) = hdf, dgi\u1ebc(D) = hf, \u2206giV (D) .\nAlso, if f and g are any two functions and one of them is finitely supported, it\nis true that\nh\u2206f, gi = hdf, dgi = hf, \u2206gi\nwhere now the inner products are taken over V (G) and \u1ebc(G).\nThroughout, we wish to study solutions of the combinatorial heat equation.\nThese will be functions on G with an additional time parameter in which they\nare differentiable and which satisfy the equation\n\u2206u(x, t) +\n\n\u2202u\n(x, t) = 0\n\u2202t\n\nfor every vertex x and every t > 0.

It is, however, essentially self-adjoint\n \u0303 to l2 (V ), a fact\nby which we mean that it has a unique self-adjoint extension \u2206\nwhich we prove in this section. Let \u2206\u2217 denote the adjoint of \u2206 with domain\nC0 (V ).\nProposition 1.3.1. The domain of \u2206\u2217 is\ndom(\u2206\u2217 ) = {f \u2208 l2 (V ) | \u2206f \u2208 l2 (V )}.\nProof: By definition\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\ndom(\u2206\u2217 ) =\nf \u2208 l2 (V )\n\uf8f3\n\nthere exists a unique h \u2208 l2 (V ) such that\nh\u2206g, f i = hg, hi for all g \u2208 C0 (V )\n\n11\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n\n\fand then \u2206\u2217 f = h. If g is finitely supported as above then we can apply the\nanalogue of Green's Theorem to get that if f \u2208 dom(\u2206\u2217 ) then\nh\u2206g, f i = hg, \u2206f i = hg, hi.\nLetting, g = \u03b4x we get that \u2206f (x) = h(x) for all vertices x so that \u2206f \u2208\nl2 (V ).\nTheorem 1.3.1. \u2206 with domain C0 (V ) is essentially self-adjoint.\nProof: From the criterion stated in [13, Theorem X.26] applied to the operator\n(\u2206 + I) it suffices to show that \u22121 is not an eigenvalue of \u2206\u2217 . In other words,\nif f satisfies \u2206\u2217 f = \u2212f then f cannot be in l2 (V ) unless it is exactly 0. As can\nbe seen by applying the analogue of Green's Theorem, pointwise, it is true that\n\u2206\u2217 f (x) = \u2206f (x). Therefore, if f satisfies \u2206\u2217 f (x) = \u2212f (x) for every vertex x,\nit follows that\nX\n\u0001\nm(x) + 1 f (x) =\nf (y).\ny\u223cx\n\nTherefore, there must exist a neighbor y \u223c x such that f (y) > f (x). By\nrepeating this argument the conclusion follows.\n\n12\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nThe Heat Kernel\n2.1\n\nConstruction of the Heat Kernel\n\nWe now give a construction of the heat kernel p = pt (x, y) for a infinite, locally\nfinite, connected graph G. By heat kernel we mean that pt (x, y) will be the\nsmallest non-negative function\np : V \u00d7 V \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, 1]\nwhich is smooth in t, satisfies the heat equation: \u2206p +\n\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n\n= 0 in either x or y\n\nand satisfies: p0 (x, y) = \u03b4x (y). The heat kernel will generate a bounded solution\nof the heat equation on G for any bounded initial condition. That is, for any\nP\nbounded function u0 , u(x, t) = y\u2208V pt (x, y)u0 (y) will give a bounded solution\nto\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206u(x, t) + \u2202u (x, t) = 0\n\u2202t\n\uf8f3 u(x, 0) = u (x)\n0\n\nfor all x \u2208 V, all t > 0\nfor all x \u2208 V.\n\nThe construction given here follows the approach of [3, Section 3] and the formalism of [2].\nStarting with an exhaustion sequence of the graph, we construct heat kernels\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions for each set in the exhaustion. Although we\n13\n\n\fwill exhaust the graph by balls of increasing radii, it will be shown later that the\nresulting heat kernel is independent of the choice of subgraphs in the exhaustion.\nLet x0 \u2208 V (G) be a fixed vertex. We will let Br = Br (x0 ) denote the ball of\nradius r about x0 , \u2202Br = \u2202Br (x0 ) its boundary, and int Br , its interior. In\nparticular, if d(x, x0 ) denotes the standard metric on graphs,\nV (Br )\n\n= {x \u2208 V (G) | d(x, x0 ) \u2264 r}\n\nE(Br )\n\n= {x \u223c y | x, y \u2208 V (Br ) and x \u223c y \u2208 E(G)}.\n\nWe then let C(Br , \u2202Br ) denote functions on Br which vanish on the boundary \u2202Br and let \u2206r denote the reduced Laplacian which acts on these spaces.\nThat is,\nC(Br , \u2202Br ) = {f \u2208 C(Br ) | f|\u2202Br = 0}\nand\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206f (x)\n\u2206r f (x) =\n\uf8f3 0\n\nfor x \u2208 int Br\notherwise\n\nfor all f \u2208 C(Br , \u2202Br ).\n\nWith these definitions we then have:\nLemma 2.1.1. \u2206r is a self-adjoint, non-negative operator on C(Br , \u2202Br ).\nProof: This follows from the analogue of Green's Theorem, Lemma 1.2.1,\nsince\nh\u2206r f, giV (Br ) = hdf, dgi\u1ebc(Br ) = hf, \u2206r giB(Br ) .\n\nFrom Lemma 2.1.1 it follows that all eigenvalues \u03bbri of \u2206r are real and nonnegative. In fact, as mentioned in [2], and to be shown later, \u03bb0 (\u2206r ) = \u03bbr0 , the\nsmallest eigenvalue of \u2206r , is given by the Rayleigh-Ritz quotient:\n\u03bbr0 =\n\nmin\n\nf \u2208C(Br ,\u2202Br )\nf 6\u22610\n\n14\n\nhdf, df i\nhf, f i\n\n\fk(r)\n\nso that all of the eigenvalues of \u2206r are positive. Denote by {\u03bbri }i=0 the set\nk(r)\n\nof all eigenvalues of \u2206r listed in increasing order and choose a set {\u03c6ri }i=0 of\ncorresponding eigenfunctions which are an orthonormal basis for C(Br , \u2202Br )\nk(r)\n\nwith respect to the l2 inner product. That is, {\u03c6ri }0=1 are such that,\n\u2206r \u03c6ri = \u03bbri \u03c6ri\nand\nX\n\nx\u2208Br\n\n\u2200i = 0, . . . , k(r)\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1\n\u03c6ri (x)\u03c6rj (x) = \u03b4ij =\n\uf8f3 0\n\nif i = j\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\notherwise.\n\nWe are now ready to define the heat kernels prt (x, y) for each subgraph in the\nexhaustion.\nDefinition 2.1.1.\nk(r)\n\nprt (x, y) =\n\nX\n\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbi t \u03c6ri (x)\u03c6ri (y)\n\ni=0\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 Br , all t \u2265 0.\n\n(2.3)\n\nTheorem 2.1.2. prt (x, y) has the following properties for every r:\n1) prt (x, y) = prt (y, x), prt (x, y) = 0 if either x \u2208 \u2202Br or y \u2208 \u2202Br .\n2) \u2206r prt (x, y) +\n\n\u2202 r\n\u2202t pt (x, y)\n\n= 0 where \u2206r denotes the reduced Laplacian in\n\neither x or y.\n3) prs+t (x, y) =\n\nP\n\nz\u2208Br\n\nprs (x, z)prt (z, y).\n\n4) pr0 (x, y) = \u03b4x (y) for x, y \u2208 int Br .\n5) prt (x, y) > 0\n6)\n\nP\n\ny\u2208Br\n\nfor all t > 0, all x, y \u2208 int Br .\n\nprt (x, y) < 1 for all t > 0, all x \u2208 Br .\n\nRemark 2.1.3.

The equivalence of these two approaches can be seen by applying the maximum principle,\nLemma 1.2.3, to the difference of the two kernels.\nProof: 1), 2) Clear from the definition of prt (x, y), the fact that \u03c6ri \u2208 C(Br , \u2202Br ),\nthat is, \u03c6ri|\u2202Br = 0, and from (2.1).\nk(r)\n\n3) Using the orthonormality of {\u03c6ri }i=1 , we compute:\nX\n\nX\nX k(r)\n\nprs (x, z)prt (z, y) =\n\nk(r)\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbi s \u03c6ri (x)\u03c6ri (z)\n\nk(r)\n\nX\n\n=\n\nr\n\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbi s e\u2212\u03bbj t \u03c6ri (x)\u03c6rj (y)\n\ni,j=0\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ri (z)\u03c6rj (z)\n\nz\u2208Br\n\nk(r)\n\n=\n\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbj t \u03c6rj (z)\u03c6rj (y)\n\nj=0\n\nz\u2208Br i=0\n\nz\u2208Br\n\nX\n\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbi (s+t) \u03c6ri (x)\u03c6ri (y)\n\n(2.2)\n\ni=0\nprs+t (x, y).\n\n4) By definition,\nk(r)\n\npr0 (x, y) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ri (x)\u03c6ri (y).\n\ni=0\n\nSince\n\nk(r)\n{\u03c6ri }i=0\n\nform an orthonormal basis, it follows that\nk(r)\n\nk(r)\n\n\u03b4x (y) =\n\nX\ni=0\n\nh\u03b4x , \u03c6ri i\u03c6ri (y) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6ri (x)\u03c6ri (y).\n\ni=0\n\nTherefore, p0 (x, y) = \u03b4x (y).\n5) The maximum principle, Lemma 1.2.3, applied in each of the variables\nseparately to prt (x, y) over the set Br \u00d7 Br \u00d7 [0, T ] implies that 0 \u2264 prt (x, y) \u2264 1\nsince pr0 (x, y) = \u03b4x (y) and prt (x, y) = 0 if either x or y is in the boundary of Br .\nNow, assume that there exists a t0 > 0 and x\u0302, \u0177 \u2208 int Br such that prt0 (x\u0302, \u0177) =\n0. We may then assume that (x\u0302, \u0177, t0 ) is a minimum for prt (x, y) on Br \u00d7 Br \u00d7\n[0, t0 ]. Then, using the fact that prt (x, y) satisfies the heat equation in both\nvariables and Br is connected, and applying the argument used in the proof of\n16\n\n\fLemma 1.2.2 over the set Br \u00d7 Br \u00d7 [0, t0 ] gives:\nprt0 (x, y) = prt0 (x\u0302, \u0177) = 0\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 int Br .\n\nIn particular,\nk(r)\n\nprt0 (x, x) =\n\nX\n\nr\n\ne\u2212\u03bbi t0 (\u03c6ri (x))2 = 0\n\nfor all x \u2208 int Br\n\ni=0\n\nimplying that \u03c6ri (x) = 0 for all i and all x \u2208 int Br contradicting the fact that\nk(r)\n\n{\u03c6ri }i=0 forms an orthonormal basis for C(Br , \u2202Br ).\n6) We may assume that x, y \u2208 int Br since prt (x, y) = 0 otherwise.

The proof of Part 6) is identical to the proof of the corresponding property for the Dirichlet heat kernels on a Riemannian manifold [3, Lemma\n3.3 Part (i)] and shows that a finite graph with Dirichlet boundary conditions\nis not stochastically complete.\nWe now wish to show that the prt (x, y) converge to the heat kernel pt (x, y)\nmentioned at the beginning of this section. For this purpose the following lemma\nwill be instrumental.\nLemma 2.1.2.\n(x, y)\nprt (x, y) \u2264 pr+1\nt\n\nfor all t \u2265 0, all x, y \u2208 Br .\n\nProof: This is clear for x or y in \u2202Br .

Since, u(x, 0) = 0 by Part 4) of\nTheorem 2.1.2 while, on \u2202Br \u00d7 [0, T ],\nu(x, t) = pr+1\n(x, y) > 0.\nt\nIt follows that\nmin u \u2265 0.\n\nBr \u00d7[0,T ]\n\nTherefore, pr+1\n(x, y) \u2265 prt (x, y) for all x, y \u2208 Br and for all t \u2265 0.\nt\nBy extending prt (x, y) to be 0 outside of Br and using 0 \u2264 prt (x, y) \u2264 1 and\nLemma 2.1.2 we see that prt (x, y) converges pointwise as r \u2192 \u221e for all x, y \u2208 V\nand all t \u2265 0. Let pt (x, y) be the limit\nprt (x, y) \u2192 pt (x, y) as r \u2192 \u221e.\nWe will now show that the convergence is uniform in t for every compact interval\n[0, T ]. To this end, we fix x and y in V , let fr (t) = prt (x, y) and f (t) = pt (x, y).\n18\n\n\fThen, from the definition and properties of each of the heat kernels pr , we get\nthat each fr : [0, \u221e) \u2192 R is C \u221e and satisfies\n1) fr \u2264 fr+1\n2) fr (t) \u2192 f (t) pointwise for all t\n3) fr (t) \u2264 1.\nDini's Theorem implies that fr \u2192 f uniformly on all compact subsets [0, T ] \u2282\n[0, \u221e).\nWe will now show that pt (x, y) satisfies the heat equation.

That is, each Di is a finite and\nS\u221e\nconnected subgraph, Di \u2282 Di+1 for all i, and G = i=1 Di . Let qtDi (x, y) denote\nthe Dirichlet heat kernels for this exhaustion and say that qtDi (x, y) \u2192 qt (x, y).\n\nThen for every Di there exists R large enough so that Di \u2282 BR . By the\nmaximum principle, since qtDi (x, y) vanishes on \u2202Di , we obtain qtDi (x, y) \u2264\nR+1\nR\npR\n(x, y) \u2264 . . . and pR\nt (x, y). Because pt (x, y) \u2264 pt\nt (x, y) \u2192 pt (x, y) this\n\nimplies that qtDi (x, y) \u2264 pt (x, y). Letting i \u2192 \u221e gives\nqt (x, y) \u2264 pt (x, y).\nInterchanging the roles of q Di and pr in the preceding argument gives qt (x, y) \u2265\npt (x, y) and therefore, pt (x, y) = qt (x, y).\n\n8) Say qt (x, y) is another non-negative function that satisfies Properties 3)\nand 4). In particular, both q and pr satisfy the heat equation on int Br \u00d7 (0, T ).\nSince pr vanishes on \u2202Br while q is non-negative there we get, by applying the\n\n20\n\n\fmaximum principle to the difference of q and pr , that qt (x, y) \u2265 prt (x, y) on\nBr \u00d7 [0, T ] and hence for all x, y \u2208 V and all t > 0 . Letting r \u2192 \u221e we get that\nqt (x, y) \u2265 pt (x, y).\n\n2.2\n\nThe Spectral Theorem Construction\n\nAs mentioned previously, an alternative way of obtaining the heat kernels prt (x, y)\non Br with Dirichlet boundary conditions is through the convergent power series\ne\u2212t\u2206r = I \u2212 t\u2206r +\n\nt2 2 t3 3\n\u2206 \u2212 \u2206r + . . .\n2 r\n6\n\nby letting prt (x, y) = (e\u2212t\u2206r \u03b4x )(y). However, on the entire graph, since the\nLaplacian is not bounded on l2 (V ), one cannot use the power series approach.\n \u0303\n \u0303 the unique self-adjoint extension of \u2206 to\nOne can still construct e\u2212t\u2206 for, \u2206,\n\nl2 (V ) by using the functional calculus developed through the spectral theorem\n[12, Chapter VIII]. The purpose of this section is to show that the construction\ngiven in the previous section via exhaustion and this approach result in the same\nP\nkernel [3, Proposition 4.5]. Let Pt v(x) = y\u2208V pt (x, y)v(y) for any bounded\n\nfunction v, with Ptr v indicating a similar sum for the heat kernel prt (x, y) on Br .\n \u0303\n\nWe then have the following theorem which states that Pt and e\u2212t\u2206 agree on a\ndense subset of l2 (V ) and, as such, have the same kernel:\nTheorem 2.2.1.\n \u0303\n\nPt v = e\u2212t\u2206 v\n\nfor all v \u2208 C0 (V ).\n\nProof: We begin by showing that if v \u2208 C0 (V ) then Pt v \u2208 l2 (V ) and \u2206Pt v \u2208\nl2 (V ). Since v is finitely supported, there exists a ball of large radius R which\n\n21\n\n\fcontains its support.

In fact, this actually proves that Pt is a bounded operator on\nl2 (V ) with kPt k \u2264 1.\nWe will now show that \u2206Pt v = Pt \u2206v and since if v is finitely supported\nthen so is \u2206v it will follows that \u2206Pt v \u2208 l2 (V ). To show that \u2206Pt v = Pt \u2206v we\ncalculate:\n\u2206(Pt v)(x)\n\n=\n\nX\n\ny\u223cx\n\n=\n\nX\n\ny\u223cx\n\n\u0001\n(Pt v)(x) \u2212 (Pt v)(y)\nX\n\nz\u2208V\n\n!\n\u0001\npt (x, z) \u2212 pt (y, z) v(z) .\n\nMeanwhile, by using the analogue of Green's Theorem and the fact that the\nheat kernel satisfies the heat equation in both variables, we get\nPt (\u2206v)(x)\n\n=\n\nX\n\npt (x, z)\u2206v(z)\n\nz\u2208V\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u2206z pt (x, z)v(z)\n\nz\u2208V\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u2206x pt (x, z)v(z)\n\nz\u2208V\n\n=\n\nX\n\nz\u2208V\n\nX\n\ny\u223cx\n\n!\n\u0001\npt (x, z) \u2212 pt (y, z) v(z).\n\nWe now give the proof of the theorem.

The material here is\nadapted from [9, p. 170-172]. We recall the definition of Pt :\nPt u0 (x) =\n\nX\n\npt (x, y)u0 (y)\n\ny\u2208V\n\nfor any bounded function u0 on G. This summation converges from Part 6) of\nTheorem 2.1.5 and from Part 5), Pt satisfies the semigroup property:\nPs (Pt u0 ) = Ps+t u0 .\nApply Pt to the function 1 which is exactly 1 on each vertex of G:\nPt 1(x) =\n\nX\n\npt (x, y)\n\ny\u2208V\n\nand note that this sum is less than or equal to 1 from Part 6) of Theorem 2.1.5.\nDefinition 3.1.1.

Although this really is a property of the heat kernel or of the\ndiffusion process which is modeled by the heat kernel, it is customary to say, as\nabove, that it is a property of the underlying space.\nTheorem 3.1.3. The following statements are equivalent:\n1) For some t0 > 0, some x0 \u2208 V , Pt0 1(x0 ) < 1.\n1') For all t > 0, all x \u2208 V , Pt 1(x) < 1.\n2) There exists a positive (equivalently, non-zero) bounded function v on G\nsuch that \u2206v = \u03bbv for any \u03bb < 0.\n2') There exists a positive, (equivalently, non-zero) bounded function v on G\nsuch that \u2206v \u2264 \u03bbv for any \u03bb < 0.\n3) There exists a nonzero, bounded solution to\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206u(x, t) + \u2202u (x, t) = 0 for all x \u2208 V, all t > 0\n\u2202t\n\uf8f3 u(x, 0) = 0\nfor all x \u2208 V.\n\nDefinition 3.1.4. Any function v on G such that \u2206v = \u03bbv is called \u03bb-harmonic\nwhereas if \u2206v \u2264 \u03bbv, v is called \u03bb-subharmonic.\nTherefore, stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the existence of a positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic (or \u03bb-subharmonic) function for negative \u03bb and to\nthe non-uniqueness of bounded solutions for the heat equation on G.\nProof:\n1') \u21d2 1) Obvious.\n25\n\n\f1) \u21d2 1') If there exists x0 \u2208 V and a t0 > 0 such that Pt0 1(x0 ) = 1 then by\nthe stong maximum principle for the heat equation, Lemma 1.2.2, applied to\nthe function Pt 1 we get that\nPt0 1(x) = 1 for all x.\nNow, if s < t0 then it follows from the semigroup property that\nPt0 1 = Pt0 \u2212s (Ps 1) \u2264 Pt0 \u2212s 1 \u2264 1.\nFor any t0 > 0 such that Pt0 1 = 1 it follows that the inequalities become\nequalities and, in particular, Ps 1 = 1 for all s < t0 .

That is,\nS\u221e\nDi \u2282 Di+1 and G = i=0 Di where each Di is finite and connected. Let \u2206i\n\ndenote the reduced Laplacian acting on the space C(Di , \u2202Di ) of functions on\nDi which vanish on the boundary \u2202Di . Then, for \u03bb < 0, one can solve\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206i vi = \u03bbvi on int Di\n\uf8f3 v\ni |\u2202Di = 1.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIndeed, letting 1Di denote the function that is 1 on every vertex of Di and 0\n\nelsewhere, if vi is a solution to the above then wi = vi \u2212 1Di would vanish on\nthe boundary of Di and on the interior would satisfy\n\u2206i wi (x) = \u2206i vi (x) = \u03bbvi (x) = \u03bb(wi (x) + 1).\nThat is,\n(\u2206i \u2212 \u03bbI)wi = \u03bbint Di\nwhere \u03bbint Di denotes the function that is equal to \u03bb on every vertex in the\ninterior of Di and is 0 on \u2202Di . Since \u03bb < 0, \u2206i \u2212 \u03bbI is invertible on C(Di , \u2202Di )\nand so\nwi = (\u2206i \u2212 \u03bbI)\u22121 (\u03bbint Di )\nyielding\nvi = (\u2206i \u2212 \u03bbI)\u22121 (\u03bbint Di ) + 1Di\nas a solution for (3.1).\nWe now claim that\n0 < vi \u2264 1 on Di .\n\n27\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fThis follows from the fact that, if there exists an x0 in the interior of Di such\nthat vi (x0 ) \u2264 0, then we may assume that x0 is a minimum for vi and\n\u2206vi (x0 ) =\n\nX\n\nx\u223cx0\n\n\u0001\nvi (x0 ) \u2212 vi (x) \u2264 0\n\nwhile \u2206vi (x0 ) = \u03bbvi (x0 ) \u2265 0 so that \u2206vi (x0 ) = 0. This implies that vi (x) =\nvi (x0 ) for all neighbors of x0 and by repeating the argument we would get that\nvi is a non-positive constant on Di contradicting that vi = 1 on the boundary\nof Di .\nTherefore, vi > 0 and so \u2206vi < 0 on the interior which implies that\nmax vi = max vi = 1.\nDi\n\n\u2202Di\n\nIndeed, at an interior maximum \u2206vi (x0 ) \u2265 0. This completes the proof of (3.2).\nFurthermore, if we extend each vi to be exactly 1 outside of Di , it is true\nthat\nvi \u2265 vi+1 .\nThis is clear on \u2202Di since vi = 1 there while vi+1 \u2264 1. On the interior of Di we\nhave that \u2206(vi \u2212 vi+1 ) = \u03bb(vi \u2212 vi+1 ) from which it follows that vi \u2212 vi+1 > 0\nby the same argument that gives vi > 0 above.\nThe vi therefore, form a non-increasing, bounded sequence so that\nvi \u2192 v\nwhere 0 \u2264 v \u2264 1 and \u2206v = \u03bbv. What remains to be shown is that v is positive\n(or non-zero) and here we use the assumption that there exists on G a positive\n(or non-zero), bounded \u03bb-subharmonic function w. That is, w is positive (or\nnon-zero), bounded and satisfies \u2206w \u2264 \u03bbw on G. Assuming that w \u2264 1, we\nshow that\nvi \u2265 w on Di for all i.\nThis can be seen as follows: on the interior of Di ,\n\u2206(vi \u2212 w) \u2265 \u03bb(vi \u2212 w).\n28\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fTherefore, if there exists an x0 in the interior of Di such that (vi \u2212 w)(x0 ) < 0\nand x0 is a minimum for vi \u2212 w then by computation \u2206(vi \u2212 w)(x0 ) \u2264 0 while\n\u2206(vi \u2212 w)(x0 ) \u2265 \u03bb(vi \u2212 w)(x0 ) > 0 from (3.3). The contradiction implies that\nvi \u2265 w on Di and by passing to the limit we get that v \u2265 w so that v is either\npositive or non-zero depending on w.\n\n2)\u21d2 3) Let w(x, t) = e\u2212\u03bbt v(x) where v is a positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic\nfunction for \u03bb < 0. Then w is positive and bounded on V \u00d7 [0, T ], and satisfies\n\u2206w + \u2202w\n\u2202t = 0 with w(x, 0) = v(x). The function Pt v also satisfies both equations\nand, moreover,\nsup Pt v(x) \u2264 sup v(x)\n\n(3.4)\n\nw(x, t) > v(x) for all t > 0, all x \u2208 V.\n\n(3.5)\n\nx\u2208V\n\nx\u2208V\n\nwhile\n\nTherefore, we have two different bounded solutions to\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206u(x, t) + \u2202u (x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) \u2208 V \u00d7 (0, T )\n\u2202t\n\uf8f3 u(x, 0) = v(x)\nall x \u2208 V.\n\nTaking the difference of the two solutions gives a nonzero, bounded solution to\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206u(x, t) + \u2202u (x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) \u2208 V \u00d7 (0, T )\n\u2202t\n(3.6)\n\uf8f3 u(x, 0) = 0\nall x \u2208 V.\n\nTherefore, we have shown the existence of a nonzero, bounded solution for\n\nthe heat equation with initial condition 0 for a finite time interval. In the\nargument below, we show that this is enough to imply condition 1), that is,\nPt 1 < 1. Then, given Pt 1 < 1, 1 \u2212 Pt 1 will give a nonzero, bounded solution to\n(3.6) for an infinite time interval, completing the proof.\nWe also note that the assumption that v is positive was not essential for the\nargument as can be seen by putting norms about Pt v, v, and w in (3.4) and\n(3.5). Therefore, the existence of any bounded, non-zero \u03bb-harmonic function\n\n29\n\n\fwill imply stochastic incompleteness and then the argument giving the implication 1\u2032 ) \u21d2 2) shows that there then exists a positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic\nfunction on G.\n\n3) \u21d2 1) Suppose that u(x, t) is nonzero, bounded and satisfies\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206u(x, t) + \u2202u (x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) \u2208 V \u00d7 (0, T )\n\u2202t\n\uf8f3 u(x, 0) = 0\nall x \u2208 V.\n\nThen, by rescaling, we may assume that |u(x, t)| < 1 for all x and t, and that\nthere exists an x0 and t0 > 0 such that u(x0 , t0 ) > 0.

Therefore, letting r \u2192 \u221e,\nPt0 1(x0 ) \u2264 w(x0 , t0 ) < 1.\n\n3.2\n\nModel Trees\n\nWe now turn our focus to a family of particular trees and study under what\nconditions they are stochastically complete. A tree will be called model if it\ncontains a vertex x0 , henceforth called the root for the model, such that the\nvalence m(x) is constant on spheres Sr (x0 ) = Sr of radius r about x0 . That is,\nif\nSr = {x | d(x, x0 ) = r}\nthen\nm(x) = m(r) for all x \u2208 Sr .\n30\n\n\fFor r > 0, we let n(r) = m(r)\u2212 1 denote the branching of T , that is, the number\nof edges connecting a vertex in Sr with vertices in Sr+1 , and let n(0) = m(x0 ).\nWe then denote such trees Tn to indicate that their structure is completely\nencoded in the branching function n(r).\nThe main purpose of this section is to prove the following theorem which\ntells us precisely when such trees are stochastically complete.\nTheorem 3.2.1. Tn is stochastically complete if and only if\n\u221e\nX\n1\n= \u221e.\nn(r)\nr=0\n\nThe idea of the proof is to study positive \u03bb-harmonic functions on Tn for\n\u03bb < 0. By averaging over spheres we can reduce to the case of \u03bb-harmonic\nfunctions depending only on the distance r from the root x0 . It then turns out\nthat such a function will be bounded if and only if the series above converges.\nSince the existence of a positive, bounded, \u03bb-harmonic function is equivalent to\nstochastic completeness, Theorem 3.2.1 will then follow.\nLet, therefore, v(r) denote a function on the vertices of Tn depending only on\nr = r(x) = d(x, x0 ), the distance from a vertex to the root. When the Laplacian\nis applied to such a function we get\n\u2206v(r)\n\n\u0001\nn(r) + 1 v(r) \u2212 n(r)v(r + 1) \u2212 v(r \u2212 1)\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n= n(r) v(r) \u2212 v(r + 1) + v(r) \u2212 v(r \u2212 1) .\n\n=\n\nWe will study the existence and boundedness of such functions on Tn when, in\naddition, they are positive and \u03bb-harmonic for a negative \u03bb, that is, they satisfy\n\u2206v(r) = \u03bbv(r) for \u03bb < 0. We start by showing that there is no loss in generality\nin restricting our study of \u03bb-harmonic functions to only functions of this type.\nLemma 3.2.1. If there exists a positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic function on Tn\nthen there exists one depending only on the distance from x0 .\n\n31\n\n\fProof: Let u(x) denote a positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic function on Tn . If Sr\ndenotes the sphere of radius r about the root x0 and Vol(Sr ) denotes its volume,\nthat is,\nVol(Sr ) = #{x | x \u2208 Sr }\nthen we define a function v(r) depending only on the radius r by averaging u\nover Sr :\nv(r) =\n\nX\n1\nu(x).\nVol(Sr )\nx\u2208Sr\n\nClearly, such a function will be positive and bounded since u(x) is. We now\nshow that v(r) is also \u03bb-harmonic. At x0 , since Vol(S1 ) = n(0), we have:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= n(0) v(0) \u2212 v(1)\n\n\u2206v(0)\n\n!\n1 X\n= n(0) u(x0 ) \u2212\nu(x)\nn(0)\nx\u2208S1\nX\nu(x)\n= n(0)u(x0 ) \u2212\nx\u223cx0\n\n= \u2206u(x0 ) = \u03bbu(x0 ) = \u03bbv(0).\nNow, if x \u2208 Sr for r > 0, then\n\u2206u(x)\n\n=\n\nX\n\u0001\nn(r) + 1 u(x) \u2212\nu(z) \u2212 u(y)\nz\u223cx\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\n=\n\n\u03bbu(x)\n\nwhere y is the unique neighbor of x that is in Sr\u22121 . Therefore,\nX\n\u0001\nn(r) + 1 \u2212 \u03bb u(x) =\nu(z) + u(y).\n\n(3.8)\n\nz\u223cx\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\nWe will average this equation over Sr and use the following version of the formula\nn(r)*Vol(Sr ) = Vol(Sr+1 ) which relates the volume of spheres of different radius\nin Tn :\nn(r)\n1\n=\n.\nVol(Sr )\nVol(Sr+1 )\n\n32\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fFrom the definition of v, we get\n\u0001\nn(r) + 1 \u2212 \u03bb v(r)\n\n(n(r) + 1 \u2212 \u03bb) X\nu(x)\nVol(Sr )\nx\u2208Sr\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\nX\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nu(z) +\nu(y)\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nVol(Sr )\nz\u223cx\ny\u223cx\n\n=\n\n=\n\nx\u2208Sr\n\n1\nVol(Sr )\n\n=\n\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\nX\n\nu(z) +\n\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\ny\u2208Sr\u22121\n\nn(r \u2212 1) X\nu(y)\nVol(Sr )\ny\u2208Sr\u22121\n\n=\n\nn(r)\nVol(Sr+1 )\n\n=\n\nn(r)v(r + 1) + v(r \u2212 1)\n\nX\n\n(3.8)\n\nu(z) +\n\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\nX\n1\nu(y) (3.9)\nVol(Sr\u22121 )\ny\u2208Sr\u22121\n\nor precisely that \u2206v(r) = \u03bbv(r).\n\nTherefore, on a model tree, the existence of any positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic\nfunction is equivalent to the existence of such a function depending only on the\ndistance to the root. The values of such a function are determined by the value\nof the function at the root and are given by:\nv(1) =\nv(r + 1) =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb\nv(0)\n1\u2212\nn(0)\n1\nn(r)\n\n(3.10)\n!\n\n\u0001\nn(r) + 1 \u2212 \u03bb v(r) \u2212 v(r \u2212 1) .\n\n(3.11)\n\nWe will now study under what conditions such a function will remain bounded.\nWe start by showing that such a function must increase with the radius.\nLemma 3.2.2.

We would like to point out the relationship between Theorem\n3.2.1 and the case of spherically symmetric or model manifolds on which we\nbase our definition of model trees. M\u03c3 , a Riemannian manifold of dimension d\nwith pole o, is called model if\ni) topologically, M\u03c3 \\ {o} is the product of an open interval I and the sphere\nS d\u22121 . Therefore, each point x \u2208 M\u03c3 \\ {o} can be identified with a pair\n(r, \u03b8) where r \u2208 I and \u03b8 \u2208 S d\u22121 .\nii) the metric on M\u03c3 is given by\nds2 = dr2 + \u03c3 2 (r)d\u03b82\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere d\u03b82 denotes the standard Euclidean metric on S d\u22121 . Here, \u03c3 is a\nsmooth, positive function on I sometimes called the twisting or warping\nfunction [9, p. 145-148].\nIt follows from (3.12) that the area of a sphere of radius r in M\u03c3 is given by\nA(Sr ) = \u03c9d \u03c3 d\u22121 (r)\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere \u03c9d is the area of the unit sphere in Rd . Now, it is shown in [9, Corollary\n6.8] that a geodesically complete, noncompact, model manifold is stochastically\ncomplete if and only if\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nVol(Br )\ndr = \u221e\nA(Sr )\n\nwhere Vol(Br ) denotes the Riemannian volume of the geodesic ball in M\u03c3 . For\n2\n\nexample, if, for large r, A(Sr ) \u2264 er then M\u03c3 is stochastically complete, whereas,\nif A(Sr ) = er\n\n2+\u01eb\n\nfor any positive \u01eb, then M\u03c3 will be incomplete.\n36\n\n\fObserve from (3.13) that, on M\u03c3 ,\ndA(Sr ) =\n=\n\n\u03c9d (d \u2212 1)\u03c3 d\u22122 (r)\u03c3 \u2032 (r) dr\n(d \u2212 1)\u03c9d (ln \u03c3(r))\u2032 A(Sr ) dr\n\nso that\ndA(Sr )\n= c(ln \u03c3(r))\u2032 dr\nA(Sr )\n\n(3.14)\n\nfor c = (d \u2212 1) \u03c9d .\nMeanwhile, for model trees, temporarily using the notation A(Sr ) = Vol(Sr )\nand dA(Sr ) = A(Sr+1 ) \u2212 A(Sr ), it follows that\n\u0001\ndA(Sr ) = n(r) \u2212 1 A(Sr )\n\nso that\n\n\u0001\ndA(Sr )\n= n(r) \u2212 1 .\nA(Sr )\n\n(3.15)\n\nTherefore, comparing (3.14) and (3.15) we see that n(r) and (ln \u03c3(r))\u2032 play\na similar role and the correspondence between the borderlines for stochastic\ncompleteness is exact.\n\n3.3\n\nComparison Theorems\n\nThroughout this section, we assume that Tn denotes a model tree with root\nvertex x0 while T denotes a general tree. From Theorem 3.2.1 in the last section,\nP\u221e\n1\n=\u221e\nwe know that Tn will be stochastically complete if and only if r=0 n(r)\n\nand we wish to obtain a similar criterion for T . In order to state our results for\nT we make the following definitions.\nDefinition 3.3.1. For a vertex x0 \u2208 T , let\nm(r) = mx0 (r)\n\n=\n\nM (r) = Mx0 (r)\n\n=\n\n37\n\nmin\n\nx\u2208Sr (x0 )\n\nm(x)\n\nmax m(x).\n\nx\u2208Sr (x0 )\n\n\fThe following result is an immediate consequence of our criterion for model\ntrees and the characterization of stochastic incompleteness in terms of \u03bb-subharmonic\nfunctions.\nTheorem 3.3.2. Assume that Tn \u2286 T and that mx0 (r) = m(r) = minx\u2208Sr (x0 ) m(x)\nsatisfies\nn(r) \u2264 m(r) \u2212 1 for all r > 0.\nThen, if Tn is stochastically incomplete, so is T .\nProof: Since Tn is stochastically incomplete, there exists a bounded, positive\nfunction v(r) on Tn such that v(r) < v(r + 1) and \u2206v(r) = \u03bbv(r) for \u03bb < 0. Let\nr(x) = d(x, x0 ) be the distance between x0 and x \u2208 T and define a function u\non T by\nu(x) = v(r(x)).\nClearly, u(x) will be bounded and positive since v is. Now, it follows from the\ninequalities v(0) \u2212 v(1) < 0 and n(0) \u2264 m(x0 ) that u(x) is \u03bb-subharmonic at\nx = x0 :\n\u2206u(x0 ) = m(x0 )u(x0 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\nu(x)\n\nx\u223cx0\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= m(x0 ) v(0) \u2212 v(1)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2264 n(0) v(0) \u2212 v(1)\n\n= \u03bbv(0) = \u03bbu(x0 ).\n\nNow, suppose that r(x) = r > 0 and y denotes the unique neighbor of x in\nSr\u22121 . Then, since n(r) \u2264 m(x) \u2212 1,\n\u2206u(x)\n\n=\n=\n\u2264\n=\n\nm(x)u(x) \u2212\n\nX\n\nz\u223cx\nz\u2208Sr+1\n\nu(z) \u2212 u(y)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n(m(x) \u2212 1) v(r) \u2212 v(r + 1) + v(r) \u2212 v(r \u2212 1)\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nn(r) v(r) \u2212 v(r + 1) + v(r) \u2212 v(r \u2212 1)\n\n\u03bbv(r) = \u03bbu(x).\n\n38\n\n\fThus, u is a positive, bounded \u03bb-subharmonic function on T implying that T is\nstochastically incomplete.\n\nThis result has the following corollary:\nCorollary 3.3.1. If T is a tree with a vertex x0 such that mx0 (r) = m(r) =\nminx\u2208Sr (x0 ) m(x) satisfies m(r) > 1 and\n\u221e\nX\nr=0\n\n1\n<\u221e\nm(r)\n\nthen T is stochastically incomplete.\nProof: From the assumption on T , we can embed Tn \u2286 T , where Tn is defined\nby\nn(r) = m(r) \u2212 1 for r > 0\nand n(0) = m(x0 ). Then\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\nr=0 n(r)\n\n< \u221e giving that Tn is stochastically\n\nincomplete and so is, therefore, T .\nRemark 3.3.3. This theorem and its corollary are unsatisfactory in the sense\nthat they require the tree to grow very rapidly in all directions from x0 in order\nto be stochastically incomplete. However, as we will see in Theorem 3.4.1 in the\nnext section, it is sufficient that the tree grows very rapidly in some direction\nfrom x0 .\nWe now prove the inverse of the last result for a general graph G.\nTheorem 3.3.4. If G is any graph with a vertex x0 such that Mx0 (r) = M (r) =\nmaxx\u2208Sr (x0 ) m(x) satisfies\n\n\u221e\nX\nr=0\n\n1\n=\u221e\nM (r)\n\nthen G is stochastically complete.\n\nProof: Let u be a positive, \u03bb-harmonic function on G for \u03bb < 0. We will show\nthat under the assumption on G, u must be unbounded. At x0 , the relation\n39\n\n\f\u2206u(x0 ) = \u03bbu(x0 ), gives that\nX\n\nx\u223cx0\n\n\u0001\nu(x) = m(x0 ) \u2212 \u03bb u(x0 ).\n\n(3.16)\n\nThis implies that there exists x1 \u223c x0 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\nu(x1 ) \u2265 1 \u2212\nu(x0 ).\nm(x0 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bb\nIf not, then for all x \u223c x0 , u(x) < 1 \u2212 m(x\nu(x0 ), giving that\n0)\nX\n\nx\u223cx0\n\n\u0012\nu(x) < m(x0 ) 1 \u2212\n\n\u03bb\nm(x0 )\n\n\u0013\n\nu(x0 )\n\ncontradicting (3.16).\nNow, by repeating the argument at x1 , we get that there must exist a neighbor y \u223c x1 such that\nu(y) \u2265\n\n\u0012\n1\u2212\n\n\u03bb\nm(x1 )\n\n\u0013\n\nu(x1 ).\n\nAlthough y is not necessarily in S2 (x0 ) we can repeat the argument until we\nobtain a vertex x2 \u2208 S2 (x0 ) such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\nu(x2 ) \u2265\n1\u2212\nu(x1 )\nm(x1 )\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u2265\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\nu(x0 ).\nm(x1 )\nm(x0 )\nIterating this argument, we get a sequence of distinct vertices x0 \u223c x1 \u223c\nx2 \u223c . . . such that xr \u2208 Sr (x0 ) and\nu(xr ) \u2265\nSince\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\ni=0 m(xi )\n\n\u2265\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\ni=0 M(i)\n\nr\u22121\nY\u0012\ni=0\n\n\u03bb\n1\u2212\nm(xi )\n\n\u0013\n\nu(x0 ).\n\n= \u221e implies that\n\nQ\u221e \u0010\ni=0\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u03bb\nm(xi )\n\n\u0011\n\n= \u221e it\n\nfollows that u cannot remain bounded, giving that G must be stochastically\ncomplete.\nRemark 3.3.5. Theorem 3.3.4 is a significant improvement over the result\nmentioned in the introduction [6, Theorem 2.10] which states that the same\n40\n\n\fconclusion as above holds if the valence is bounded above by a constant. In fact\nthe proof there can be extended to show that if M (r) is o(r) then the graph is\nstochastically complete whereas our result says that M (r) can even be O(r).\nA corollary of Theorem 3.3.4 for trees is the following:\nCorollary 3.3.2.

The result there states that a general tree T will be stochastically incomplete if, starting out at a fixed vertex, the branching grows rapidly in all directions. The next theorem states that the same conclusion holds if the branching\ngrows rapidly in just one direction.\nWe start by slightly altering the notation used in the previous section. If x0\nand x1 are vertices of T with x0 \u223c x1 then we now denote\nm(r) = m{x0 ,x1 } (r) =\n\nmin\n\nx\u2208Sr (x0 )\nd(x,x1 )=r\u22121\n\nm(x)\n\nfor r \u2265 1\n\nso that the minimum is now taken over those x in Sr (x0 ) such that d(x, x1 ) =\nr \u2212 1.\nTheorem 3.4.1.

For a graph G with x0 \u2208 G and any \u03bb < 0 there exists\na function v on G such that v(x0 ) = 1, 0 < v(x) \u2264 1 for all vertices x and\n\u2206v(x) = \u03bbv(x) for all vertices x 6= x0 .\nProof of Theorem 3.4.1: Assuming Proposition 3.4.1, we apply it to define\na positive, bounded \u03bb-harmonic function v on the part of T below x0 in Figure\n3.1 with v(x0 ) = 1. For the part of T above x0 in Figure 3.1, the assumption\non T implies that we can embed a stochastically incomplete model subtree Tn\nwith root vertex x0 where n(0) = 1 and n(r) = m(r) \u2212 1 for r \u2265 1. We extend\nthe function v to be defined on Tn by first making it \u03bb-harmonic at x0 :\n\u0001 X\nv(x1 ) = m(x0 ) \u2212 \u03bb \u2212\nv(x).\nx\u223cx0\nx6=x1\n\nThen, if r denotes the distance to the root, v can be defined on the rest of Tn\nby\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\u2212\u03bb\n1\nv(r + 1) = 1 +\nv(r) \u2212\nv(r \u2212 1)\nn(r)\nn(r)\n42\n\nfor r \u2265 2.\n\n\fThis function will remain bounded since\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\nr=1 n(r)\n\n< \u221e. Therefore, by the\n\nargument used in the proof of Theorem 3.3.2, there exists a positive, bounded\n\u03bb-subharmonic function on T . By Theorem 3.1.3, T is then stochastically incomplete.\n\nProof of Proposition 3.4.1: Let Br (x0 ) denote the ball of radius r about x0\nin G. For \u03bb < 0, on each Br (x0 ) there exists a unique solution to the following\nsystem of equations:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2206vr (x) = \u03bbvr (x)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nvr (x0 ) = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nvr (x) = 0\n\nfor all x \u2208 int Br \\ {x0 }\n(3.17)\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202Br .\n\nIndeed, from basic linear algebra, since the system has the same number of\n\nequations as there are values for vr , there will exist a unique solution if 0 is the\nonly function which satisfies\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2206vr (x) = vr (x)\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nfor all x \u2208 int Br \\ {x0 }\n(3.18)\n\nvr (x0 ) = 0\n\nvr (x) = 0\n\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202Br .\n\nTo show that this is so, suppose that vr is a non-zero solution to (3.18). We\ncan then assume that there exists a vertex x\u0302 in the interior such that vr (x\u0302) > 0\nand x\u0302 is a maximum for vr on Br (x0 ). Then, by calculation, \u2206vr (x\u0302) \u2265 0, while\n\u2206vr (x\u0302) = \u03bbvr (x\u0302) < 0 giving a contradiction. The same argument could be used\nto show that vr cannot have a negative minimum. Therefore, any solution to\n(3.18) must be zero. This gives existence and uniqueness of a solution to (3.17).\nTherefore, for \u03bb < 0, for each r there exists a unique solution to\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u2206vr (x) = \u03bbvr (x) for all x \u2208 int Br \\ {x0 }\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nvr (x0 ) = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nvr (x) = 0\nfor all x \u2208 \u2202Br .\n43\n\n\fOn the interior of Br , a solution must satisfy\n0 < vr \u2264 1.\nFor, supposing that there exists a vertex x\u0302 in the interior such that vr (x\u0302) \u2264 0\nand x\u0302 is a minimum for vr then, as before, by calculation, \u2206vr (x\u0302) \u2264 0 while\n\u2206vr (x\u0302) = \u03bbvr (x\u0302) \u2265 0. Therefore, vr (x) = vr (x\u0302) for all x next to x\u0302 and, by\nrepeating the argument, it would follow that vr is a constant function for a\nnon-positive constant yielding a contradiction since vr (x0 ) = 1. Hence, vr > 0\nimplying \u2206vr < 0 for all vertices in the interior except for x0 so that vr \u2264 1\nsince at an interior maximum \u2206vr \u2265 0.\nSimilarly, since \u2206(vr+1 \u2212 vr ) = \u03bb(vr+1 \u2212 vr ), it follows that vr \u2264 vr+1 on Br\nand by extending each vr to be 0 outside of Br , we get that\nvr \u2264 vr+1 on G.\nTherefore, we can define v as the limit\nvr \u2192 v as r \u2192 \u221e.\nIt follows that v satisfies 0 < v \u2264 1, v(x0 ) = 1, and \u2206v = \u03bbv for all vertices of\nG except for x0 .\n\n3.5\n\nHeat Kernel Comparison\n\nThe purpose of this section is to prove two theorems which compare the heat\nkernel on a general tree to the heat kernel on a model. These theorems were\ninspired by an analogous result of Cheeger and Yau on model manifolds [1,\nTheorem 3.1]. Fixing a vertex x0 in a tree T , we now denote\nm(r) =\n\nmin\n\nx\u2208Sr (x0 )\n\nm(x) and M (r) =\n\nmax m(x)\n\nx\u2208Sr (x0 )\n\nthe minimum and maximum valence along the spheres Sr (x0 ). Throughout, we\nuse the notation \u03c1t (x0 , x) for the heat kernel on Tn , while pt (x0 , x) will denote\n44\n\n\fthe heat kernel on T . We will first show that, as a function of x, \u03c1t (x0 , x)\nis constant on the spheres Sr (x0 ) in Tn . Let \u03c1t (r) = \u03c1t (0, r(x)) denote this\ncommon value. Then the two main theorems of the section can be stated as\nfollows:\nTheorem 3.5.1. If M (r) \u2264 n(r) + 1 for all r > 0 then\n\u03c1t (r) \u2264 pt (x0 , x)\nfor all x \u2208 Sr (x0 ) \u2282 T.\nTheorem 3.5.2. If n(r) \u2264 m(r) \u2212 1 for all r > 0 then\npt (x0 , x) \u2264 \u03c1t (r)\nfor all x \u2208 Sr (x0 ) \u2282 T .\nThe proofs will follow easily from the maximum principle for the heat equation once we establish two general lemmas concerning the heat kernel on Tn .\nWe start by proving the property of the heat kernel mentioned at the start of\nthis section.\nLemma 3.5.1. On Tn\n\u03c1t (x0 , x) = \u03c1t (r)\nfor all x \u2208 Sr (x0 ).\nProof: This result is essentially a restatement of the fact that the coefficients\nof the Laplacian depend only on the valence which, on Tn , only depends on the\ndistance from the root.\nWe establish the result for the heat kernels \u03c1R\nt (x0 , x) on BR (x0 ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions and pass to the limit. The heat kernel \u03c1R\nt (x0 , x) is the\nkernel of the operator semigroup\n\ne\u2212t\u2206R = I \u2212 t\u2206R +\n\nt3 \u22063R\nt2 \u22062R\n\u2212\n+ ...\n2\n6\n\n45\n\n\fwhere \u2206R denotes the reduced Laplacian on BR (x0 ). That is,\n\u03c1R\nt (x0 , x) = h\u03b4x0 , \u03b4x i \u2212 t\u2206R (x0 , x) +\n\nt2 2\n\u2206 (x0 , x) \u2212 . . .\n2 R\n\nwhere the coefficients of the Laplacian \u2206R (x0 , x) are given by\n\u2206R \u03b4x0 (x)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 n(0) if x = x0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u22121\nif x \u2208 S1 (x0 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise\n\n\u2206R (x0 , x) =\n\n=\n\nand\n\nm+n\n\u2206R\n(x0 , x) =\n\nX\n\nn\n\u2206m\nR (x0 , y)\u2206R (y, x).\n\ny\u2208BR\n\nTherefore, these only depend on the distance between x0 and x.\nLemma 3.5.2. On Tn\n\u03c1t (r) \u2265 \u03c1t (r + 1)\n\nfor all r \u2265 0.\n\nProof: We start with the general fact that for any graph\n\u2202\npt (x, x) \u2264 0\n\u2202t\n\nfor all t > 0.\n\nIndeed, working with the heat kernels pR\nt (x, y) on BR (x0 ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions but now using the eigenfunction expansion we have\nk(R)\n\npR\nt (x, x)\n\n=\n\nX\nj=0\n\n\u00012\nR\ne\u2212\u03bbj t \u03c6R\nj (x)\n\nimplying\nk(R)\nX\n\u00012\n\u2202 R\n\u2212\u03bbR\nj t \u03c6R (x)\n<0\n\u2212\u03bbR\npt (x, x) =\nj\nj e\n\u2202t\nj=0\n\nsince \u03bbR\nj > 0. By passing to the limit we get that\nTherefore, in particular,\n\n\u2202 R\n\u2202t \u03c1t (0)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t pt (x, x)\n\n< 0 which implies that\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\nR\n\u2206\u03c1R\nt (0) = n(0) \u03c1t (0) \u2212 \u03c1t (1) > 0.\n46\n\n\u2264 0.\n\n\fThus,\nR\n\u03c1R\nt (0) > \u03c1t (1).\n\nWe also have that\nR\n\u03c1R\nt (R \u2212 1) > \u03c1t (R) = 0\n\nso that, as a function of r, \u03c1R\nt (r) is decreasing at r = 0 as well as at r = R \u2212 1\nfor all t > 0.\nFix now a time t0 > 0 and assume that there exists an i0 > 0 such that\nR\n\u03c1R\nt0 (i0 ) < \u03c1t0 (i0 + 1)\n\nwhere i0 is the smallest number with this property. Therefore, as a function of\nR\nr, \u03c1R\nt0 (r) achieves a local minimum at r = i0 . Since \u03c1t0 (r) is decreasing again at\n\nr = R \u2212 1, it follows that there must exist a j0 , i0 < j0 \u2264 R \u2212 1 such that\nR\n\u03c1R\nt0 (j0 ) > \u03c1t0 (j0 + 1).\n\nTherefore, \u03c1R\nt0 (r) has a local maximum at r = j0 . It follows from calculation\nthat\n\u2206\u03c1R\nt0 (i0 ) < 0\n\nand\n\n\u2206\u03c1R\nt0 (j0 ) > 0\n\n\u2202 R\n\u03c1 (i0 ) > 0\n\u2202t t0\n\nand\n\n\u2202 R\n\u03c1 (j0 ) < 0.\n\u2202t t0\n\nimplying\n\nTherefore, at a previous time t1 < t0 , \u03c1R\nt1 (r), as a function of r, achieves a\nR\nsmaller minimum than \u03c1R\nt0 (i0 ) and a larger maximum then \u03c1t0 (j0 ). That is,\n\nthere exist i1 and j1 such that\nR\nR\nR\n\u03c1R\nt1 (i1 ) < \u03c1t0 (i0 ) and \u03c1t1 (j1 ) > \u03c1t0 (j0 )\n\nimplying, in particular, that\nR\n\u03c1R\nt1 (i1 ) < \u03c1t1 (j1 ).\n\n47\n\n\fSince this argument can be repeated for any positive time t, it follows that\neventually we reach t = 0 at which point we would have an i and j, 0 < i < j <\nR, such that\nR\n\u03c1R\n0 (i) < \u03c10 (j)\nR\nR\ncontradicting the fact that pR\n0 (r) = 0 for all r 6= 0. Therefore, \u03c1t (r) \u2265 \u03c1t (r + 1)\n\nfor all r and letting R \u2192 \u221e we get\n\u03c1t (r) \u2265 \u03c1t (r + 1).\n\nProof of Theorems 3.5.1 and 3.5.2:\n\nThe proofs of the the two Theorems\n\nare nearly identical so we give details for the proof of Theorem 3.5.1 and then\npoint out the modifications needed for the proof of Theorem 3.5.2. We will\ndenote the Laplacian on Tn by \u2206Tn to distinguish it from \u2206T , the Laplacian on\nT , wherever it is necessary.\nFor Theorem 3.5.1 it follows from the assumption M (r) \u2264 n(r) + 1 that\nwe can embed T into Tn . Hence, we think of T \u2286 Tn , and want to show that\n\u03c1t (r(x)) \u2264 pt (x0 , x) for all vertices of T , where r(x) = d(x, x0 ). We work with\nthe Dirichlet heat kernels on BR (x0 ) \u2282 T and consider the function\nR\nuR (x, t) = \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 pt (x0 , x)\n\non BR \u00d7 [0, S]. Then\nuR (x, 0) = 0 for all x \u2208 BR\nand\nuR (x, t) = 0 for all x \u2208 \u2202BR , all t.\nFurthermore, it follows from m(x) \u2212 1 \u2264 n(r(x)) and from Lemma 3.5.2 that\n\n48\n\n\f\u03c1R\nt (r(x)) satisfies the following inequality for any x \u2208 BR :\n\u2206T \u03c1R\nt (r(x))\n\n=\n\n\u2264\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\n(m(x) \u2212 1) \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 \u03c1t (r(x) + 1)\n\nR\n+ \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 \u03c1t (r(x) \u2212 1)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR\nn(r(x)) \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 \u03c1t (r(x) + 1)\n\nR\n+ \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 \u03c1t (r(x) \u2212 1)\n\n=\n\n\u2206Tn \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) = \u2212\n\n\u2202 R\n\u03c1 (r(x)).\n\u2202t t\n\nTherefore, uR (x, t) satisfies\n\u2206T uR (x, t) +\n\n\u2202 R\nu (x, t) \u2264 0.\n\u2202t\n\nBy applying the maximum principle for the heat equation (see Remark 1.2.1),\nit follows that\nmax uR (x, t) =\n\nBR \u00d7[0,S]\n\nmax\n\nBR \u00d7{0} \u222a\n\u2202BR \u00d7[0,S]\n\nuR (x, t) = 0.\n\nR\nR\nR\nTherefore, \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 pt (x, x0 ) \u2264 0 so that \u03c1t (r(x)) \u2264 pt (x, x0 ). Since this\n\nholds for every R, by letting R \u2192 \u221e, we get that\n\u03c1t (r(x)) \u2264 pt (x, x0 ).\nFor Theorem 3.5.2, from the assumption that n(r) \u2264 m(r) \u2212 1, we may\nassume that Tn \u2286 T and we want to show that pt (x0 , x) \u2264 \u03c1t (r(x)). First,\nextend \u03c1 to be defined on all of T as before by letting:\n\u03c1t (x) = \u03c1t (r(x)) for x \u2208 T.\nThen, since n(r) \u2264 m(x) \u2212 1 for all x \u2208 Sr \u2282 T , it follows that\nR\nuR (x, t) = \u03c1R\nt (r(x)) \u2212 pt (x0 , x)\n\nnow satisfies\n\u2206T uR (x, t) +\n\n\u2202 R\nu (x, t) \u2265 0.\n\u2202t t\n49\n\n\fThis implies that\nmin\n\nBR \u00d7[0,S]\n\nuR (x, t) =\n\nmin\n\nBR \u00d7{0} \u222a\n\u2202BR \u00d7[0,S]\n\nuR (x, t) = 0\n\nimplying\nR\npR\nt (x0 , x) \u2264 \u03c1t (r(x)).\n\nIn fact, using the same proof as above, we can extend the result of Theorem\n3.5.2 to a slightly more general graph G in which a model subtree Tn may be\nembedded. Essentially, we obtain G by allowing any two vertices on the same\nsphere to be connected by an edge in T from Theorem 3.5.2. To make this\nprecise, we introduce the following notation which will be useful later as well.\nLet x0 \u2208 G be a fixed vertex and r(x) = d(x, x0 ).\nDefinition 3.5.3. For x \u2208 G let\nm0 (x)\n\n=\n\n#{y | y \u223c x and r(y) = r(x)}\n\nm+1 (x)\n\n=\n\n#{y | y \u223c x and r(y) = r(x) + 1}\n\nm\u22121 (x)\n\n=\n\n#{y | y \u223c x and r(y) = r(x) \u2212 1}\n\nThat is, m0 (x), m+1 (x), and m\u22121 (x) denote the number of vertices that are\nthe same distance, further away, and closer to x0 than is x, respectively. We\nthen state and prove the following:\nTheorem 3.5.4. If G is any graph with n(r) \u2264 m+1 (x) for all x \u2208 Sr (x0 ) and\nm\u22121 (x) = 1 for all vertices of G then\npt (x0 , x) \u2264 \u03c1t (r)\nfor all x \u2208 Sr (x0 ) \u2282 G.\n\n50\n\n\fProof: As before, we may assume that Tn \u2282 G.

That is, in particular,\nbounded solutions to the heat equation involving \u2206bd with bounded initial conditions are unique. We refer to [4, 5] for the definitions involved.\nWe define the bounded Laplacian to be the operator\n\u2206bd f (x)\n\n= f (x) \u2212\n=\n\n1 X\nf (y)\nm(x) y\u223cx\n\n1\n\u2206f (x).\nm(x)\n\nIn order for the analogue of Green's Theorem to hold we alter the inner product\non the space of functions on the graph. We now let\nhf, gibd =\n\nX\n\nf (x)g(x)m(x)\n\nx\u2208V\n\nwhile keeping the inner product on edges the same as before.

This result was inspired by an analogous result in [14, Theorem 2.1]\nand was proven for the bounded Laplacian in [4].\nFix a vertex x0 in G and let Br = Br (x0 ) denote the ball of radius r about\nx0 with boundary \u2202Br as before. Also, let \u2206r denote the reduced Laplacian\nacting on the space C(Br , \u2202Br ) of functions on Br that vanish on the boundary\n\u2202Br .

It is clear that this number is independent of the choice of\nexhaustion sequence for the graph G since if {Di }\u221e\ni=0 is any other exhaustion\nsequence then for each R there is IR large enough so that BR \u2282 DIR . Therefore,\nDIR\n\nby Lemma 4.1.1, \u03bbR\n0 \u2265 \u03bb0\n\nr\n. Reversing the roles of Br and Di , we get that \u03bbB\n0\n\ni\nand \u03bbD\n0 converge to the same number. Also, for future reference, we point out\n\nthat \u03bb0 (\u2206) can also be defined as\n\u03bb0 (\u2206) =\n\ninf\n\nf \u2208C0 (V )\nf 6\u22610\n\nhdf, df i\nhf, f i\n\nwhere C0 (V ) denotes the set of finitely supported functions on the graph G.\nWe now state and prove the following characterization of \u03bb0 (\u2206) in terms of\n\u03bb-harmonic functions [14, Theorem 2.1].\nTheorem 4.1.2. For every \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb0 (\u2206) there exists a positive \u03bb-harmonic function. For every \u03bb > \u03bb0 (\u2206) there is no such function.\n\n56\n\n\fProof: The proof of the first part is a variation of the argument given in [2,\nTheorem 2.4]. See also [4, Proposition 1.5] for the case of the bounded Laplacian\nand [8, Lemma 1] for manifolds.\nWe start with the case of \u03bb = \u03bb0 (\u2206). From Lemma 4.1.1, for each r there\nexists a positive function vr such that\n\u2206r vr = \u03bbr0 vr on int Br .\nWe normalize this function so that vr (x0 ) = 1 and extend it to be 0 outside\nof Br . We will show that this function is bounded for all vertices x. Let\nM (i) = Mx0 (i) = maxx\u2208Si (x0 ) m(x) as before. Then if x1 \u2208 S1 \u2282 int Br it\nfollows from \u2206vr (x0 ) > 0 that\nm(x0 )vr (x0 ) >\n\nX\n\nx\u223cx0\n\nvr (x) \u2265 vr (x1 )\n\nimplying\nvr (x1 ) < M (0).\nBy repeating the same argument we get that if xi \u2208 Si where i < r then\nvr (xi ) < M (i \u2212 1)M (i \u2212 2) . . . M (0).\n\n(4.2)\n\nNow, using the diagonal process we can find a subsequence of {vr }\u221e\nr=1 which\nconverges for all vertices x. Denote this as\nvrk (x) \u2192 v(x) as k \u2192 \u221e for all x.\nIt follows that \u2206v(x) = \u03bb0 v(x) for all vertices x, v \u2265 0 and v(x0 ) = 1. By using\nthe same argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.1.1 if there exists an x where\nv(x) = 0 then v would have to be constantly 0 yielding a contradiction since\nv(x0 ) = 1. This completes the case of \u03bb = \u03bb0 .\nFor the case of \u03bb < \u03bb0 (\u2206) we modify the argument above as follows. First,\nas noted in the proof of the implication 2\u2032 ) \u21d2 2) in Theorem 3.1.3, since \u03bb <\n\u03bb0 (\u2206) \u2264 \u03bb0 (\u2206r ) the operator (\u2206r \u2212 \u03bbI) is positive and hence invertible on\n57\n\n\fC(Br , \u2202Br ), the space of all functions on Br which vanish on \u2202Br , so that one\ncan find a function vr which satisfies\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2206r vr = \u03bbvr\n\non int Br\n\n\uf8f3 v\nr |\u2202Br = 1.\n\nIndeed, as before, one can let vr = (\u2206r \u2212 \u03bbI)\u22121 (\u03bbint Br ) + 1, where \u03bbint Br is\nthe function equal to \u03bb on every vertex in the interior of Br and 0 elsewhere\nand 1 is equal to 1 on every vertex of Br . We renormalize vr so that it is equal\nto 1 at x0 and call it ur , that is, let\nur =\n\n1\nvr .\nvr (x0 )\n\nNow, if ur \u2265 0 on the interior of Br then ur > 0 on the interior of Br by\nthe same argument as above. To show that ur \u2265 0 we assume that there exists\na vertex x\u0302 in the interior of Br where ur (x\u0302) < 0 and let w be a new function\ndefined by\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 ur (x)\nw(x) =\n\uf8f3 0\n\nfor x such that ur (x) < 0\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, w(x) = 0 if x is in the boundary of Br , so the error term vanishes\nwhen we apply the analogue of Green's Theorem to w below. Now, if x is a\nvertex in the interior of Br such that ur < 0 for x and all neighbors of x then\n\u2206w(x) = \u2206ur (x). If x is a vertex where ur (x) < 0 and x has a neighbor y for\nwhich ur (y) \u2265 0 then \u2206w(x) \u2265 \u2206ur (x). Combining these, it follows that\nhdw, dwi\n\n=\n=\n\nh\u2206w, wi\nX\n\u2206w(x)w(x)\n\nx\u2208int Br\nur (x)<0\n\n\u2264\n=\n\nX\n\n\u2206ur (x)ur (x)\n\nx\u2208int Br\nur (x)<0\n\n\u03bb\n\nX\n\nx\u2208int Br\nur (x)<0\n\n=\n\n\u03bbhw, wi\n58\n\nur (x)2\n\n\fso that\nhdw, dwi\n\u2264 \u03bb.\nhw, wi\nFrom Lemma 4.1.1 it would follow that \u03bb0 (\u2206r ) \u2264 \u03bb contradicting the assumption that \u03bb < \u03bb0 (\u2206). Therefore, ur \u2265 0 on the interior of Br and so ur > 0\nthere as well.\nNow, if 0 < \u03bb < \u03bb0 (\u2206) then we can use the same argument as above to\nshow that ur (x) is bounded for all vertices x as in (4.2). If \u03bb \u2264 0 then from\n\u2206ur = \u03bbur the bound becomes\nur (x1 ) \u2264 M (0) \u2212 \u03bb\nfor all x1 \u2208 S1 and\nur (xi ) \u2264 (M (i \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03bb)(M (i \u2212 2) \u2212 \u03bb) . . . (M (0) \u2212 \u03bb)\nfor all xi \u2208 Si . The remainder of the argument is the same as before. This\ncompletes the proof of the first part of Theorem 4.1.2.\nThe proof of the second part of Theorem 4.1.2 is adapted from [14, p. 761].\nSee [4] for a different proof involving the use of Green's Theorem. Suppose that\nthere exists a positive function v such that \u2206v = \u03bbv. Then, letting\nu(x, t) = e\u2212\u03bbt v(x)\nand\nw(x, t) =\n\nX\n\nprt (x, y)v(y)\n\ny\u2208Br\n\nwe see that both u and w satisfy the heat equation on int Br \u00d7 (0, S) and\nu(x, 0) = w(x, 0) = v(x) on int Br with u(x, 0) = v(x) > 0 and w(x, 0) = 0 on\n\u2202Br . By applying the maximum principle for the heat equation to the difference\nof the two functions we get that\nmin (u \u2212 w) =\n\nBr \u00d7[0,S]\n\nmin\n\n(u \u2212 w) \u2265 0\n\nBr \u00d7{0}\u222a\n\u2202Br \u00d7[0,S]\n\n59\n\n\fby what was noted above and since w(x, t) vanishes on \u2202Br while u(x, t) is\npositive there.

It follows\nthat \u03bb \u2264 \u03bbr0 for all r so that \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb0 (\u2206).\n\n4.1.1\n\nRelationship to Stochastic Incompleteness\n\nIn light of the large volume growth that is required for a graph to be stochastically incomplete and the well-known relationship between the bottom of the\nspectrum and Cheeger's constant which is, at least partially, outlined in this\nsubsection and the next section, it might seem plausible to conjecture that\nstochastic incompleteness would imply that \u03bb0 (\u2206) > 0. The purpose of this\nsubsection is to give an example where this is not the case.\nThe example is constructed as follows: start with a model tree Tn which is\nP\u221e\n1\nstochastically incomplete, that is, such that r=0 n(r)\n< \u221e, and attach to the\nroot vertex x0 an infinitely long path x0 \u223c x1 \u223c x2 \u223c . . . . The resulting tree\n\nwill be stochastically incomplete by Theorem 3.4.1.\nWe now show that \u03bb0 (\u2206) = 0.

By taking increasingly larger connected\nsubgraphs of the path that was added onto out model tree Tn , it is clear that\nthis ratio goes to 0 since L(\u2202D) = 2, for all such subgraphs.\n\n4.2\n\nLower Bounds\n\nIn this section we prove some estimates of \u03bb0 (\u2206), the bottom of the spectrum\nof \u2206. In order to prove our results, we work with the bounded Laplacian \u2206bd\nand use the characterization of \u03bb0 (\u2206bd ) in terms of Cheeger's constant proved\nin [5] to get a lower bound for \u03bb0 (\u2206bd ). We then transfer this result to obtain\na lower bound for \u03bb0 (\u2206).\nWe recall that \u2206bd is given by\n\u2206bd f (x) = f (x) \u2212\n\n1\n1 X\n\u2206f (x).\nf (y) =\nm(x) y\u223cx\nm(x)\n\nThe bottom of the spectrum is, as for \u2206, given by an exhaustion argument or,\nequivalently, as\n\u03bb0 (\u2206bd ) =\n\nh\u2206bd f, f ibd\nhf, f ibd\nf \u2208C0 (V )\ninf\n\nf 6\u22610\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all nonzero, finitely supported functions f and\nthe inner product is now given by\nhf, f ibd =\n\nX\n\nx\u2208V\n\n61\n\nf (x)2 m(x).\n\n\fFor a finite subgraph D we define A(D), the area of D, to be\nA(D) =\n\nX\n\nm(x)\n\nx\u2208D\n\nand L(\u2202D), the length of the boundary, to be\nL(\u2202D) = #{y \u223c x | x \u2208 D and y 6\u2208 D}\nas in the previous subsection.
