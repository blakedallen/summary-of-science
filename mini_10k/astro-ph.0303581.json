The AGN phenomenon is commonplace only in galaxies with high mass, high velocity dispersion, and high stellar surface\nmass density. Most normal galaxies with these properties have old stellar populations. However, the hosts of powerful AGNs (Seyfert 2s) have young stellar populations. The fraction\nof AGN hosts that have recently undergone a major starburst also increases with AGN luminosity. A powerful AGN presumably requires a massive black hole (host with a substantial\nbulge) plus an abundant fuel supply (a star-forming ISM). This combination is rare today,\nbut would have been far more common at early epochs.\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1.1\n\nMotivation\nThere is no doubt that that there is a profound physical connection between the\ncreation of supermassive black holes and the formation of bulges and elliptical galaxies. The\nremarkably tight correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass in\nthese systems (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt .et al. 2000) provides powerful evidence\nfor this connection. The similarities and differences between the strong cosmic evolution of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star formation (e.g., Steidel et al. 1999; Fan et al. 2001)\nthen lead naturally to the speculation that AGN evolution traces the build up of the spheroidal\ncomponent of galaxies (e.g., Haehnelt & Kauffman 2000; Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000).\nTo put the connection between black hole and galaxy building in context, it is interesting to note that the \"universal\" ratio of \u223c 10\u22123 between the black hole and stellar mass in\nspheroids implies that a moderately powerful AGN with a bolometric luminosity of 1011 L\u2299\nfueled by accretion with radiative efficiency of 10% would require an associated average\nstar formation rate of 65 M\u2299 yr\u22121 if the spheroid and black hole were to be built on the same\n1\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\ntime scale. The young stars would outshine the AGN by nearly an order of magnitude in this\ncase!\nSeveral interrelated questions immediately arise, and have indeed formed the basis for\nmost of the discussion at this conference. What are the relevant astrophysical processes that\nconnect the formation of bulges and black holes? What conditions foster the fueling of a\npowerful AGN? Given our current understanding of galaxy evolution, can we account for\nthe cosmic evolution of the AGN population? Can we see a scaled-down version of bulge\nbuilding surrounding powerful AGNs in the local Universe, or, instead, are powerful AGNs\ntoday just the temporary rejuvenation of a pre-existing black hole with little associated star\nformation? Can we make any sense of the complex gas/star/black hole ecosystem with all\nits messy gastrophysics?\n1.1.2\n\nMy Perspective\nMy goal is to review what is presently known about the possible connection between star formation and the AGN phenomenon, both in active galaxies and in their nuclei.\nThis is sometimes called the \"starburst-AGN connection\" (e.g., Terlevich 1989; Heckman\n1991), a vast, sprawling topic that cannot be adequately reviewed in a single short paper. Excellent overviews may be found in the volumes edited by Filippenko (1992) and Aretxaga,\nKunth, & Mujica (2001a). Other recent reviews that complement the present paper include\nthose by Veilleux (2001) and Cid Fernandes, Schmitt, & Storchi-Bergmann (2001a).\nThis paper will be focused in scope and methodology. I will just review observations,\nand only discuss spectroscopic measures of the stellar populations (ignoring indirect evidence for star formation like molecular gas, and far-IR, UV, and radio continuum emission).\nI will strongly emphasize systematic investigations of large well-defined samples. These\nrestrictions will allow me to make rather robust statements about the empirical basis for a\nconnection between AGNs and star formation. However, these restrictions effectively limit\nme to the local Universe. While the black hole/bulge connection was largely established at\nhigh redshift, I hope to show that we can gain key insights from the fossil record and from\nlocal analogs.\n1.1.3\n\nSpectral Diagnostics of Young Stars\nFor young massive stars the strongest spectral features with the greatest diagnostic\npower lie in the vacuum UV regime between the Lyman break and \u223c2000 \u00c5 (e.g., Leitherer\net al. 1999; de Mello, Leitherer, & Heckman 2000). These include the strong stellar wind\nlines of the O VI, N V, Si IV, and C IV resonance transitions and a host of weaker stellar\nphotospheric lines. Most of the photospheric lines arise from highly excited states and their\nstellar origin is unambiguous. While resonance absorption lines may have an interstellar\norigin, the characteristic widths of the stellar wind profiles make them robust indicators\nof the presence of massive stars. Unfortunately, observations in this spectral regime are\ndifficult. Only a handful of local type 2 Seyferts and LINERs have nuclear UV fluxes that\nare high enough to enable a spectroscopic investigation. While this small sample may not be\nrepresentative, the available data firmly establish the presence of a dominant population of\nyoung stars (Heckman et al. 1997; Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. 1998; Maoz et al. 1998; Colina\n& Arribas 1999).\nWhile the optical spectral window is far more accessible, the available diagnostic features of massive stars are weaker and less easy to interpret. Old stars are cool and have\n2\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\nmany strong spectral features in the optical due to molecules and low-ionization metallic\nspecies. Hot young stars have relatively featureless optical spectra\u2217 . Thus, the spectroscopic impact of the presence of young stars is mostly an indirect one: as they contribute\nan increasing fraction of the light (as the luminosity-weighted mean stellar age decreases)\nmost of the strongest spectral features in the optical weaken. This effect is easy to measure.\nUnfortunately, the effect of adding \"featureless\" nonstellar continuum from an AGN and\nyoung starlight will be similar in this regard.\nThe strongest optical absorption lines from young stars are the Balmer lines. These reach\npeak strength in early A-type stars, and so they are most sensitive to a stellar population with\nan age of \u223c100 Myr to 1 Gyr (e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. 1998). Thus, the Balmer lines\ndo not uniquely trace the youngest stellar population\u2217. On the plus side, they can be used\nto characterize past bursts of star formation (e.g., Dressler & Gunn 1983; Kauffmann et al.\n2003a).\nThe situation is summarized in Figure 1.1, which plots the strength of the Balmer H\u03b4\nabsorption line (the H\u03b4A index) vs. the 4000 \u00c5 break strength [the Dn (4000) index] for a\nset of 32,000 model galaxies with different star formation histories (see Kauffmann et al.\n2003a). For \"well-behaved\" (continuous) histories of past star formation there is a tight\ninverse relation between these two parameters. The addition of a starburst moves the galaxy\nbelow and to the left of the main locus at early times (\u2264 100 Myr) times and above it at\nintermediate times (100 Myr to 1 Gyr).\nNote that the effect of adding featureless AGN continuum will carry an old stellar population located at roughly (2, \u22122) in Figure 1.1 to (1, 0). This \"mixing line\" lies well under\nthe loci of the stellar populations [the latter having much stronger H\u03b4A at a given Dn (4000)].\nThis underscores the importance of the Balmer absorption lines, and of the need to properly\naccount for the contaminating effects of nebular Balmer emission lines. The relative nebular\ncontamination is minimized for the high-order Balmer lines in the blue and near-UV.\nSo far, I have equated young stars with hot stars. This is certainly true for main-sequence\nstars. However, a population of red supergiants will contribute significantly to the near-IR\nlight in young stellar populations\u2020. The spectral features produced by red supergiants are\nqualitatively similar to those produced by red giants that dominate the near-IR light in an old\nstellar population. A robust method to determine whether old giants or young supergiants\ndominate is to measure the M/L ratio in the near-IR using the stellar velocity dispersion.\nSo far this technique has been applied to only a small sample, but the results are tantalizing\n(Oliva et al. 1999; Schinnerer et al. 2003).\nIn an old stellar population, cool stars provide most of the light in the optical and near-IR\nand so the associated metallic and molecular spectral features are strong in both bands. In\ncontrast, the optical (near-IR) continuum in a young stellar population will be dominated by\n\u2217\n\nThe most direct optical signatures of young massive stars are the photospheric lines of He I and the broad\nemission features due to Wolf-Rayet stars. The former reach peak strength in early B stars and hence in stellar\npopulations with ages of tens of Myr (Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado, Leitherer, & Heckman 1999). The latter trace the\nmost massive stars and reach peak strengths for ages of several Myr (e.g., Leitherer et al. 1999). Both the He I\nand Wolf-Rayet features are weak and contaminated by nebular emission lines. They have been detected in only\na handful of AGNs (Heckman et al. 1997; Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. 1998; Storchi-Bergmann, Cid Fernandes, &\nSchmitt 1998).\n\u2217 In view of this, and in view of the importance of the Balmer lines, throughout this review I will use the term\n\"young\" to mean stellar populations with ages less than a Gyr.\n\u2020 For an instantaneous burst of star formation, red supergiants do not appear until \u223c5 to 6 Myr have elapsed.\nThus, they are absent only in very young bursts of very short duration.\n\n3\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\n\nFig. 1.1. Indices measuring the 4000 \u00c5 break and H\u03b4 absorption line are plotted\nfor a grid of 32,000 model galaxies with different star formation histories. The\ndark diagonal line is an age sequence of galaxies with continuous star formation\nhistories (young at upper left and old at lower right). The other points represent\nmodels in which a strong burst of star formation has occurred within the last \u223c 1\nGyr. (See Kauffmann et al. 2003a.)\nhot main-sequence stars (cool supergiants). The metallic/molecular lines are therefore weak\nin the optical and strong in the near-IR. This combination of properties provided some of the\nfirst direct evidence for a young stellar population in AGNs (Terlevich, D\u00edaz, & Terlevich\n1990; Nelson & Whittle 1999).\n1.1.4\n\nEmission-Line Diagnostics and AGN Classification\nAs noted above, I will be emphasizing optical spectroscopy in this review of the\nstellar populations in AGNs. Historically, this has also been the most widely used technique\nto detect and classify AGNs themselves.\nAGNs can be broadly classified depending upon whether the central black hole and its\nassociated continuum and broad emission-line region is viewed directly (a \"type 1\" AGN) or\nis obscured by a surrounding dusty medium (a \"type 2\" AGN). Since this obscuring medium\n4\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\ndoes not fully cover 4\u03c0 steradians as seen from the central AGN. some of the AGN radiation\nescapes the central region and photoionizes surrounding circumnuclear (\u223c 102 to 103 pcscale) gas, leading to strong, relatively narrow permitted and forbidden emission lines from\nthe \"narrow-line region\" (NLR). In type 1 AGNs, the optical continuum is dominated by\nnonstellar emission, making it difficult to study the stellar population. In what follows, I\nwill therefore ignore this type of AGN. In type 2 AGNs the observed optical continuum is\npredominantly starlight, with some contribution by light from the obscured AGN scattered\ninto our line of sight and from nebular continuum associated with the NLR (e.g., Tran 1995;\nWills et al. 2002).\nIn the simplest version of the \"unified\" model for AGNs (Antonucci 1993) the type 1\nand type 2 AGNs are drawn from the same parent population and differ only in our viewing angle. In this case the stellar content of the two types will be the same. On the other\nhand, if the solid angle covered by the dusty obscuring medium varies substantially, then\ntype 1 (2) AGNs will be preferentially drawn from those objects with smaller (larger) covering fractions for this medium. In such a case systematic differences might exist in stellar\ncontent between type 1 and type 2 AGNs (especially if the dusty obscurer is related to star\nformation). There have been recurring suggestions to this effect (e.g., Maiolino et al. 1995;\nMalkan, Gorjian, & Tam 1998; Oliva et al. 1999). It is important to keep this possible bias\nin mind.\nNarrow emission lines can also be produced via photoionization by hot young stars. The\nmost unambiguous discrimination between excitation of the NLR by young stars vs. an AGN\nis provided by lines due to species with ionization potentials greater than 54 eV (above the\nHe II edge), since a young stellar population produces a negligible supply of such highenergy photons. Unfortunately, most such high-ionization lines are weak in the optical\nspectra of AGNs. In practice, classification is therefore usually based on the flux ratios\nof the strongest lines (Heckman 1980a,b; Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich 1981; Veilleux &\nOsterbrock 1987).\nAn example of such a classification diagram is shown in Figure 1.2, based on nearly\n56,000 emission-line galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sample discussed\nbelow. In this plot of the [O III] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2 vs. the [N II] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1 NLR line ratios, two\ndistinct sequences are present. Star-forming galaxies define a narrow locus in which the\nmetallicity increases from the upper left to the lower center. The plume that ascends from\nthe high-metallicity end of the starformer sequence toward higher values of both [O III]/H\u03b2\nand [N II]/H\u03b1 is the AGN population. In simple physical terms, the high-energy continuum\nof an AGN results in much greater photoelectric heating per ionization, which raises the\ntemperature in the ionized gas, and therefore strengthens the collisionally excited forbidden\nlines that cool the gas.\nIt is important to realize that a contribution to the emission-line spectrum by regions\nof star formation is almost inevitable in many of the AGNs in Figure 1.2: at the median\nredshift of the SDSS main galaxy sample (z \u2248 0.1) the 3\u2032\u2032 diameter SDSS fiber corresponds\nto a projected size of nearly 6 kpc. Thus, a galaxy's position along the AGN plume will be\ndetermined by the relative contribution of the AGN and star formation to the emission-line\nspectrum. This is particularly important in the context of this review because it means that\nthe signature of young stars is present in the nebular emission lines as well as in the stellar\nabsorption lines.\nThe AGN plume is quite broad at its upper end, where the AGN contribution is dominant.\n5\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\n\nFig. 1.2. Diagnostic flux-ratio diagram for a sample of nearly 56,000 emission-line\ngalaxies from the SDSS. According to Kewley et al. (2001) galaxies dominated by\nan AGN will lie above and to the right of the dotted line. Galaxies lying below\nand to the left of the dashed line are dominated by star-forming regions. Galaxies\nlying between the dashed and dotted curves are transition objects (AGN and star\nformation are both important). The locations of classic AGN-dominated Seyfert\nnuclei and LINERs are indicated.\nTraditionally, these AGN-dominated objects are classified as Seyferts if [O III]/H\u03b2 > 3 and\nas low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) if [O III]/H\u03b2 < 3 (e.g., Veilleux &\nOsterbrock 1987). The latter AGNs are more common, but do not attain the high luminosities\nof powerful Seyfert nuclei (e.g., Heckman 1980b; Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent 2003).\n\n1.2\n\nYoung Stars in Active Galactic Nuclei\n\nSpectroscopy of the nearest AGNs affords the opportunity to study the starburstAGN connection on small physical scales (> a few pc). The drawback is that the nearest\nAGNs have low luminosities, and we might expect that the amount of star formation associated with black hole fueling would scale in some way with AGN power. To get a complete\n6\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\npicture it is thus important to examine both the nearest AGNs and more powerful AGNs. I\nwill review these two regimes in turn.\nThe earliest investigation of the stellar population for a moderately large sample of the\nnearest AGNs was by Heckman (1980a,b), who discussed 30 LINERs found in a survey of\na sample of 90 optically bright galaxies. The typical projected radius of the spectroscopic\naperture was \u223c200 pc. The spectra covered the range from 3500 to 5300 \u00c5. LINERs were\nprimarily found in galaxies of early Hubble type (E through Sb). Based on the strengths\nof the stellar metallic lines and the high-order Balmer lines, the nuclear continuum was\ndominated by old stars in about 3/4 of the LINERs, while a contribution of younger stars\nwas clearly present in the remainder. Typical luminosities of the [O III] \u03bb5007 and H\u03b1 NLR\nemission lines were \u223c 105 to 106 L\u2299 .\nHo et al. (2003) have recently examined the nuclear (typical radius \u223c 100 pc) stellar\npopulation in a complete sample of \u223c500 bright, nearby galaxies (of which 43% contain an\nAGN). In nearly all respects this is a major step forward from my old analysis. The sample\nis considerably larger, the quality of the spectra is superior, and the analysis of the emissionline properties more careful and more sophisticated. The larger sample size and improved\ntreatment of the emission lines allow Ho et al. to study statistically significant samples of\nlow-luminosity LINERs, type 2 Seyferts, and transition nuclei, and to span a larger range\nin AGN luminosity (LH\u03b1 \u2248 104 to 107 L\u2299 ). The only disadvantage of these spectra is that\nthey do not extend shortward of 4230 \u00c5 and so they miss the H\u03b4 and higher-order Balmer\nlines that most effectively probe young stars. Nevertheless, their results are qualitatively\nconsistent with those of Heckman (1980a,b). The AGNs are hosted by early-type galaxies (E\nthrough Sbc). With a few exceptions, the AGNs have predominantly old stellar populations.\nThe exceptions are primarily transition nuclei whose emission-line spectra suggest excitation\nby a mix of an AGN and massive stars.\nMy colleagues (Cid Fernandes, Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado, Schmitt, Storchi-Bergmann) and I\nhave recently undertaken a program of near-UV spectroscopy of 43 LINER and transition\nnuclei taken from the Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent (1997) survey. Our specific goal was to\naccess the high-order stellar Balmer absorption lines. We detect these lines in about half of\nthe transition nuclei, but in very few LINERs. The cases in which hot stars are present are\nprimarily Sb, Sbc, or Sc galaxies. These results are consistent with the idea that transition\nnuclei are composite AGN/starformers.\nLet me now discuss significantly more powerful AGNs (classical type 2 Seyferts). It\nwas recognized very early-on (e.g., Koski 1978) that the optical spectra of powerful type\n2 Seyfert nuclei could not be explained purely by an old stellar population. An additional\n\"featureless continuum\" that typically produced 10% to 50% of the optical continuum was\npresent. Until relatively recently, it was tacitly assumed that this component was light from\nthe AGN (plausibly light from the hidden type 1 Seyfert nucleus that had been reflected\ninto our line of sight by free electrons and/or dust). However, a detailed spectropolarimetric\ninvestigation by Tran (1995) and related arguments by Cid Fernandes & Terlevich (1995)\nand Heckman et al. (1995) showed that only a small fraction of this continuum could be\nattributed to scattered AGN light. While nebular continuum emission must be present (e.g.,\nTran 1995; Wills et al. 2002), Cid Fernandes & Terlevich (1995) and Heckman et al. (1995)\nargued that young stars were the main contributors.\nThis has been confirmed by several major optical spectroscopic investigations of moderately large samples of type 2 Seyfert nuclei (Schmitt, Storchi-Bergmann, & Cid Fernandes\n7\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\n1999; Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado, Heckman, & Leitherer 2001; Cid Fernandes et al. 2001b; Joguet\net al. 2001). The latter two papers examined the nuclear stellar population in 35 and in\n79 type 2 Seyferts, respectively. The projected aperture sizes range from a few hundred pc\nto about a kpc. On average, these are considerably more powerful AGNs than those in the\nHeckman (1980b) or Ho et al. (2003) samples, with [O III] luminosities of 106 to 109 L\u2299 .\nThe principal conclusion is that a young (< 1 Gyr) stellar population is clearly present\nin about half of the Seyfert 2 nuclei. Cid Fernandes et al. (2001b) find that the fraction\nof nuclei with young stars is \u223c60% when L[O III] > 107 L\u2299 but is only \u223c10% for the less\npowerful nuclei. They also found that the \"young\" Seyfert 2 nuclei were hosted by galaxies\nwith much larger far-IR luminosities (\u223c 1010 to 1012 L\u2299 ) than the \"old\" nuclei (\u223c 109 to\n1010 L\u2299 ), suggesting that the global star formation rate was correspondingly higher (a topic\nconsidered in some detail below). Interestingly, Joguet et al. (2001) found that the Hubble\ntype distribution for the host galaxies was roughly the same for the \"old\" and \"young\" nuclei (S0 to Sc). Using morphological classifications based on the Hubble Space Telescope\nimaging survey of (Malkan et al. 1998), Storchi-Bergmann et al. (2001) find a reasonably\ngood correspondence between the presence of a young nuclear population and a late \"inner\nHubble type\" (the presence of dust lanes and spiral features in the inner few kpc).\nTo date, spectroscopic investigations of the nuclear stellar populations in powerful radioloud type 2 AGNs (the so-called \"narrow-line radio galaxies\") have been restricted to relatively small samples (Schmitt, Storchi-Bergmann & Cid Fernandes 1999; Aretxaga et al.\n2001b; Wills et al. 2002; Tadhunter et al. 2002). A young nuclear stellar population has\nbeen detected in about 1/3 of the cases.\n\n1.3\n\nYoung Stars in AGN Host Galaxies\n\nIn the previous section I have reviewed spectroscopy of the stellar population in the\nnuclear region (the centralmost \u223c 102 to 103 pc). I now turn my attention to more global\nproperties of AGN hosts.\nRaimann et al. (2003) have recently used long-slit optical/near-UV spectroscopy to measure the radial variation in the stellar population for the sample of type 2 Seyfert galaxies\nwhose nuclear properties were investigated by Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado et al. (2001). They characterize the stellar content by fitting each spectrum with a set of spectra of stellar clusters\nspanning a range in age and metal abundance.\nThey find that the Seyfert 2's have younger mean ages than their comparison sample of\nnormal galaxies at both nuclear and off-nuclear locations. The sample-averaged \"vector\" of\nthe fractional contribution to the continuum at 4000 \u00c5 by stellar populations with ages of 10\nGyr, 1 Gyr, 30 Myr, and 3 Myr is (0.36, 0.25, 0.24, 0.15) at the nucleus, (0.36, 0.31, 0.20,\n0.13) at 1 kpc, and (0.32, 0.30, 0.27, 0.11) at 3 kpc. Thus, the stellar population shows no\nstrong systematic radial gradient in the hosts of powerful Seyfert 2 nuclei (at least out to\nradii of several kpc).\n1.3.1\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nSo far, I have reported on spectroscopy of modest-sized samples of AGNs. The\nongoing SDSS (York et al. 2000; Stoughton et al. 2002; Blanton et al. 2003; Pier et al. 2003)\nprovides us with the opportunity to investigate the structure and stellar content of the hosts\nof tens of thousands of AGNs! In the remainder of the paper I will give a progress report on\nan on-going program in this vein that is a close collaboration between groups at JHU and\n8\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\nMPA-Garching (Kauffmann et al., in preparation). The program was made possible by the\ninspiration and perspiration of the dedicated team that over the past 13 years has created and\noperated the SDSS.\nThe SDSS is using a dedicated 2.5-meter wide-field telescope at the Apache Point Observatory to conduct an imaging and spectroscopic survey of about a quarter of the sky. The\nimaging is conducted in the u, g, r, i, and z bands (Fukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 1998;\nHogg et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2002), and spectra are obtained with a pair of multi-fiber spectrographs built by Alan Uomoto and his team at JHU. When the survey is complete, spectra\nwill have been obtained for nearly 106 galaxies and 105 QSOs selected from the imaging\ndata. Details on the spectroscopic target selection for the \"main\" galaxy sample and QSO\nsample can be found in Strauss et al. (2002) and Richards et al. (2002), respectively. We will\nbe summarizing results based on spectra of \u223c123,000 galaxies contained in the the SDSS\nData Release One (DR1). These data are to be made publically available early in 2003.\nSince I will primarily be discussing results derived from the spectra, it is useful to summarize their salient features. Spectra are obtained through 3\u2032\u2032 diameter fibers. At the median\nredshift of the main galaxy sample (z \u2248 0.1) this corresponds to a projected aperture size\nof \u223c6 kpc which typically contains 20% to 40% of the total galaxy light. Thus, the SDSS\nspectra are closer to global than to nuclear spectra. At the median redshift the spectra cover\nthe rest-frame wavelength range from \u223c3500 to 8500 \u00c5 with a spectral resolution R \u2248 2000\n(\u03c3 instr \u2248 65 km s\u22121 ). The spectra are spectrophotometrically calibrated through observations of subdwarf F stars in each 3-degree field. By design, the spectra are well-suited to the\ndeterminations of the principal properties of the stars and ionized gas in galaxies.\n1.3.2\n\nOur Methodology\nFor the convenience of the reader we give a brief summary of our methodology\nbelow. For a much more complete description see Kauffmann et al. (2003a).\nThe rich stellar absorption-line spectrum of a typical SDSS galaxy is both a blessing and\na curse. While the lines provide unique information about the stellar content and galaxy dynamics, they make the measurement of weak nebular emission lines quite difficult. To deal\nwith this, we have performed a careful subtraction of the stellar absorption-line spectrum\nbefore measuring the nebular emission lines. This is accomplished by fitting the emissionline-free regions of the spectrum with a model galaxy spectrum. The model spectra are\nbased on the new population synthesis code of Bruzual & Charlot (2003), which incorporates high-resolution stellar libraries. A set of 39 model template spectra were used that\nspan the relevant range in age and metallicity. After convolving the template spectra to the\nmeasured stellar velocity dispersion (\u03c3\u2217 ) of an individual SDSS galaxy, the best fit to the\ngalaxy spectrum is constructed from a linear combination of the template spectra.\nAs diagnostics of the stellar population we have used the amplitude of the 4000 \u00c5 break\n[the Dn (4000) index of Balogh et al. 1999] and the strength of the H\u03b4 absorption line (the\nLick H\u03b4A index of Worthey & Ottaviani 1997). The diagnostic power of these indices is\nshown in Figure 1.1 above. In both cases the indices measured in the SDSS galaxy spectra\nare corrected for the flux of the emission lines in their bandpasses.\nUsing a library of 32,000 star formation histories that span the relevant range in metallicity, we have used the measured Dn (4000) and H\u03b4A indices to estimate the SDSS z-band\nmass-to-light ratio for each galaxy. By comparing the colors of our best-fitting model to\n9\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\nthose of each galaxy, we have estimated the dust extinction of starlight in the z-band (e.g.,\nCalzetti, Kinney, & Storchi-Bergmann 1994; Charlot & Fall 2000).\nThe SDSS imaging data are then used to provide the basic structural parameters. The zband absolute magnitude and the derived values of M/L and Az yield the stellar mass (M\u2217 ).\nThe half-light radius in the z-band and the stellar mass yield the effective stellar surface mass\n2\ndensity (\u03bc\u2217 = M\u2217 /2\u03c0r50,z\n). As a proxy for Hubble type we use the SDSS \"concentration\"\nparameter C, which is defined as the ratio of the radii enclosing 90% and 50% of the galaxy\nlight in the r band (see Stoughton et al. 2002). Strateva et al. (2001) find that galaxies with\nC > 2.6 are mostly early-type galaxies, whereas spirals and irregulars have 2.0 < C < 2.6.\n1.3.3\n\nResults\nAs discussed in Kauffmann et al. (2003b - hereafter K03), the overall SDSS galaxy\npopulation is remarkably bimodal in nature. There is a rather abrupt transition in properties\nat a critical stellar mass M\u2217 \u2248 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . Below this mass, galaxies are young [small\nDn (4000) and large H\u03b4A ], are disk dominated (low concentration, C < 2.6), and show a\nstrong increase in surface mass density (\u03bc\u2217 ) with increasing mass. Above this mass, galaxies\nare old [large Dn (4000) and small H\u03b4A ], are bulge dominated (C > 2.6), and have a uniform\n\u03bc\u2217 . There is also a strong transition in mean stellar age at a characteristic surface mass\ndensity of 3 \u00d7 108M\u2299 kpc\u22122 and a concentration index of 2.6.\nWhere do AGN hosts fit into this landscape? We find that AGNs are commonly present\nonly in galaxies with large masses (> 1010 M\u2299 ), stellar velocity dispersions (> 100 km s\u22121 ),\nand surface mass densities (> 108 M\u2299 kpc\u22122 )\u2217 . Their stellar content and structure varies\nsignificantly as a function of AGN luminosity.\nBefore proceeding, a brief digression is necessary. Any attempt to characterize the stellar\npopulation in the AGN hosts with these spectra must, by necessity, include the transition\nobjects that comprise the majority of the AGNs in Figure 1.2. Excluding these would bias\nthe sample against host galaxies with significant amounts of on-going star formation. The\nonly disadvantage of including the transition class is that it is then difficult (on the basis of\nthe emission-line ratios alone) to classify them as Seyferts with star formation or LINERs\nwith star formation.\nIt has long been known that LINERs do not attain the high luminosities of powerful\nSeyfert nuclei (e.g., Heckman 1980b; Ho et al. 2003)\u2020. Thus, rather than classifying\nAGNs according to their line ratios, it makes more sense to examine how the properties\nof AGN hosts vary as a function of AGN luminosity (using the [O III] \u03bb5007 line as a\nmeasure). This allows us to include the transition class AGNs and thus mitigate the selection effects described above. For reference, the change-over from a LINER-dominated to\nSeyfert-dominated population occurs at an extinction-corrected value of L[O III] \u2248 107 L\u2299 in\nthe SDSS sample.\nWe find that the stellar content of the AGN hosts is a strong function of L[O III] (Fig. 1.3).\n\u2217\n\nTremonti et al. (in preparation) find the SDSS galaxies obey a strong mass-metallicity relation. Since AGNs are\nhosted by massive galaxies, they have high metallicity. This explains why the \"AGN plume\" ascends from the\nregion of metal-rich starformers in Figure 1.2.\n\u2020 In the SDSS sample, the luminosity of the [O III] \u03bb5007 emission line (the strong line from the NLR that is\nleast contaminated by a contribution from galactic H II regions) is larger in type 2 Seyferts than in LINERs\nby an average factor of about 30 to 100 for galaxies with the same stellar mass or velocity dispersion. If we\nassume that AGNs hosts obey the (in)famous relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion,\nthis would imply that on average LINERs are AGNs operating in a mode with a much lower L/LEdd than Seyfert\nnuclei. The same trend is seen by Ho (2002, 2003) in nearby galaxies\n\n10\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\n\nFig. 1.3. Contour plots of conditional density distributions (see K03) showing\ntrends in the age-sensitive index Dn (4000) as a function of stellar mass M\u2217 and\nsurface mass density \u03bc\u2217 for all galaxies (top), weak AGNs with L[O III] < 107 L\u2299\n(middle), and powerful AGNs with L[O III] > 107 L\u2299 (bottom). Galaxies have been\nweighted by 1/Vmax , and the bivariate distribution function has been normalized to\na fixed number of galaxies in each bin of log M\u2217 (left) and log \u03bc\u2217 (right). The plots\nare only made over ranges in M\u2217 and \u03bc\u2217 where there are at least 100 objects per bin\n(so the plots for the AGN hosts do not extend to low M\u2217 or \u03bc\u2217 ).\n\nThis figure shows that the galaxy population as a whole is strongly bimodal (young, low\nmass, and low density, or old, high mass, and high density). What is very striking is that\nwhile the weak AGNs roughly follow the same trend as the normal massive galaxies, the\n11\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\n\nFig. 1.4. Comparison of composite near-UV spectra for the hosts of several hundred of the most powerful type 2 Seyferts in the SDSS (top) with a similar composite spectrum of normal star-forming galaxies with similar stellar masses as the\nSeyferts (bottom). Both spectra have been normalized to unit flux at 4200 \u00c5 and\nthen the composite spectrum for the normal galaxies has been offset by \u22120.5 flux\nunits for clarity. Note that both spectra have similar strengths for the Ca II lines\nfrom an old stellar population and the high-order Balmer absorption lines from\nyoung stars.\n\npowerful AGNs do not. The powerful AGNs are hosted by galaxies that are massive and\ndense, but relatively young.\nCould the relatively small value for the Dn (4000) index be caused by featureless AGN\ncontinuum rather than young stars? Decisive evidence against this is provided by the Balmer\nabsorption lines, which are strong in the hosts of powerful AGNs. This is illustrated in Figure\n1.4 which compares a high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum of several hundred of\nthe most powerful AGNs (L[O III] > 108 L\u2299 ) to a similar composite spectrum of normal highmass, star-forming galaxies. More generally, nearly all the powerful AGNs in our sample lie\non or above the locus of the continuous models of star formation in Figure 1.1. They have\nstrong Balmer absorption lines as well as a relatively small Dn (4000) index, so the latter is\nnot due to dilution by AGN light.\nK03 found that the fraction of galaxies that have undergone a major burst of star formation\nwithin the past Gyr declines strongly with increasing galaxy mass. The fraction of all SDSS\ngalaxies that have experienced a major burst (at better than the 97.5% confidence level)\nis only about 0.1% to 0.3% over the range in M\u2217 appropriate for typical AGN hosts. In\n12\n\n\fT. M. Heckman\ncontrast, the fraction of \"high-confidence\" bursts in the AGN hosts rises with increasing\nAGN luminosity, from \u223c1% at the lowest luminosities to nearly 10% at the highest.\nThus, it appears that powerful type 2 AGNs (Seyferts) reside in galaxies that have a combination of properties that are rare in the galaxy population as a whole: they are massive\n(and dense) but have relatively young stellar populations. This may have a very simple\nexplanation. The two necessary ingredients for a powerful AGN are a massive black hole\nand an abundant fuel supply. Only massive galaxies contain massive black holes, and only\ngalaxies with significant amounts of recent/ongoing star formation have the requisite fuel\nsupply (ISM). This combination is rare today. The most massive black holes live mostly\nin the barren environment of a massive early-type galaxy. This was evidently not the case\nduring the AGN era.\nThe rarity of galaxies having this combination of properties today implies that we may be\nwitnessing a transient event. This would be consistent with the relatively large fraction of\nthe hosts of powerful AGNs that have undergone a major starburst within the last \u223c 1 Gyr\n(a rough galaxy merger time scale).\nThe above picture is appealingly simple. However, one possible \"fly in the ointment\" is\nthe recent result that the hosts of powerful low-redshift QSOs are very massive but otherwise\nnormal elliptical galaxies (Dunlop et al. 2003). If the stellar population of the QSO hosts is\nin fact old, then our results on the hosts of powerful Seyfert 2s could mean that the standard\nunified scenario for AGNs is seriously incomplete at high luminosities.\n\n1.4\n\nSummary\n\nI have reviewed our understanding of the connection between star formation and\nthe AGN phenomenon, emphasizing large surveys that have used direct spectroscopic diagnostics to search for young (< 1 Gyr) stars in AGNs and in their host galaxies in the\nlocal Universe. I have considered only those objects in which the blinding glare of the central AGN is obscured from our direct view, so that the optical continuum is dominated by\nstarlight. For these \"type 2\" AGNs I have used the luminosity of the narrow-line region as\nan indicator of AGN power.\nThe major conclusions are as follows:\nGalactic Nuclei (\u223c 102 to 103 pc): The majority of galaxies of early/middle Hubble type\ncontain AGNs, usually of low luminosity. In most cases, the nuclear stellar population in\nlow-power AGNs is predominantly old. In contrast, a young stellar population is detected in\nabout half of the powerful type 2 Seyfert nuclei.\nHost Galaxies (\u223c 104 pc): The host galaxies of AGNs have large stellar masses and\nsurface mass densities. Normal galaxies like this have predominantly old stellar populations.\nWhile the stellar content of the hosts of low-power AGNs appears normal, the hosts of\npowerful AGNs have young stellar populations. A significant fraction of these young hosts\nhave undergone major starbursts in the last \u223c 1 Gyr.\nThe observational evidence for a connection between star formation and black hole fueling is thus clearer in powerful AGNs. This is true both in the nucleus itself and in its host\ngalaxy. Such a dependence is astrophysically plausible, and is qualitatively consistent with\nthe processes that established the correlation between black hole and stellar mass in galaxy\nbulges.\nThe most natural explanation for why powerful AGNs are hosted by massive galaxies\nwith young stellar populations is that a powerful AGN requires both a high mass black hole\n13\n\n\fT.

While this combination is rare today, it would have been much more common during the AGN era at high\nredshift.\nI would like to thank Carnegie Observatories, in particular Luis Ho, for organizing and\nhosting such a successful meeting.
