Besides that, a more recent paper\n[1] proposes a geometric revisitation of the calculus of variations in the presence of non\u2013holonomic\nconstraints.\nThe present work uses the arguments of [1] and the geometrical framework provided by [2, 3] to\nanalyze the underlying gauge structure of constrained variational calculus. As a by\u2013product, the\nresulting scheme allows to obtain the relevant ingredients that are commonly used in the variational\ncontext as canonical geometrical objects.\nThe topic will be developed within the family of differentiable curves alone, thus avoiding all the\nissues coming from the possible presence of corners which are of poor significance from the gauge\u2013\ntheoretical point of view. The extension to the piecewise differentiable case, surely interesting on\nits own, can however be easily pursued.\nConsider an abstract system B, subject to a set of differentiable and possibly non\u2013holonomic\nconstraints, and let A denote its admissible velocity space.\nThen, define an action functional by integrating a suitable differentiable \"cost function\" on A\n- called the Lagrangian - along the admissible evolutions of the system. In its essential features,\nthe variational problem we shall deal with is the one of characterizing, among all those evolutions\nof B which fulfil the restrictions imposed by the assigned constraints and connect a fixed pair of\nconfigurations, the extremals (if at all) of the given action functional. As we shall see, the whole\ntopic has very close links with optimal control theory.\nFor the sake of convenience, the first part of the paper shall be devoted as a reference tool\nconsisting of a brief review of a few basic aspects of jet\u2013bundle geometry and non\u2013holonomic\ngeometry as well as of those contents of [1, 2, 3] that will be involved in the subsequent discussion.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD. BRUNO, G. LURIA, E. PAGANI\n\nThis will include, among other things, a revisitation of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian bundles.\nAll results will be stated without any proofs nor comments.\nAfterwards, we shall develop an algorithm able to establish a canonical correspondence between\nthe input data of the problem, namely the constraints and the Lagrangian function, and an alternative free variational problem over a distinguished overlying affine bundle C (A) \u2192 A. In the\nresulting setup, under suitable hypotheses, the gauge\u2013independent problem in C (A) is proved to\nbe equivalent to the actual constrained one. This clarifies the geometrical essence of Pontryagin's\nmethod, based on the introduction of the costates.\nAs the final element, the circumstances under which the correspondence between the solutions of\nthe variational problem in A and those of its associated problem in C (A) is 1 \u2212 1 are investigated.\n1. Geometric setup\nt\n\n1.1. Preliminaries. Let Vn+1 \u2212\u2192 R denote an (n+1)\u2013dimensional fibre bundle, henceforth called\nthe event space and referred to local fibred coordinates t, q 1 , . . . , q n .\nEvery section \u03b3 : R \u2192 Vn+1 , locally described as q i = q i (t), will be interpreted as an evolution\nof an abstract system B , parameterized in terms of the independent variable t. The first jet\u2013\n\u03c0\nspace j1 (Vn+1 ) \u2212\u2192 Vn+1 is an affine bundle over Vn+1 , modelled on the vertical space V (Vn+1 ).\nBy the very definition of jet\u2013bundle, every section \u03b3 : R \u2192 Vn+1 may be lifted to a section\nj1 (\u03b3) : R \u2192 j1 (Vn+1 ), simply by assigning to each t \u2208 R the tangent vector to \u03b3 . The section\nj1 (\u03b3) will be called the jet\u2013extension of \u03b3 on j1 (Vn+1 ).\nBoth spaces j1 (Vn+1 ) and V (Vn+1 ) may be viewed as submanifolds of the tangent space T (Vn+1 )\naccording to the identifications\n(1.1a)\n\nj1 (Vn+1 ) = {z \u2208 T (Vn+1 ) hz, dti = 1}\n\n(1.1b)\n\nV (Vn+1 ) = {v \u2208 T (Vn+1 ) hv, dti = 0}\n\nThe terminology is borrowed from Classical Mechanics, where B is identified with a material\nsystem, the manifold Vn+1 with its configuration space\u2013time, the projection t : Vn+1 \u2192 R with\nthe absolute time function and the jet\u2013space j1 (Vn+1 ) with the velocity space of B .\nThe geometry of the manifold j1 (Vn+1 ) will be regarded as known. The reader is referred to\n[1, 4] for the notation, the terminology and a thorough analysis. Unless otherwise stated, given any\nset of local coordinates on Vn+1 , the corresponding local jet\u2013coordinate system on j1 (Vn+1 ) will be\ndenoted by t, q 1 , . . . , q n , q\u0307 1 , . . . , q\u0307 n .\n\u03c0\n\nThe dual of the vertical bundle, henceforth denoted by V \u2217 (Vn+1 ) \u2212\u2192 Vn+1 , is, in view of eq.(1.1b),\ncanonically isomorphic to the quotient of the cotangent space T \u2217 (Vn+1 ) by the equivalence relation\n(\n\u03c0(\u03c3) = \u03c0(\u03c3 \u2032 )\n\u03c3 \u223c \u03c3 \u2032 \u21d0\u21d2\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2032 \u221d dt \u03c0(\u03c3)\nEvery local coordinate system t, q i in Vn+1 induces fibred coordinates t, q i , p\u0302i in V \u2217 (Vn+1 ), with\n+\n* \u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2200 \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 V \u2217 (Vn+1 )\np\u0302i (\u03c3\u0302) := \u03c3\u0302,\n\u2202q i \u03c0(\u03c3\u0302)\n\n\fON THE GAUGE STRUCTURE OF THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS WITH CONSTRAINTS\n\n3\n\nand transformation laws\n(1.2)\n\n\u2202q k\np\u0302 \u0304i = p\u0302k\n\u2202 q\u0304 i\n\nq\u0304 i = q\u0304 i (t, q 1 , . . . , q n ) ,\n\nt\u0304 = t + c ,\n\nThe annihilator of the\ndistribution\nto the totality of the jet\u2013extensions of sections \u03b3 is\n\u0001 tangent\n\u0001\n\u2217\na subspace C j1 (Vn+1 ) of T j1 (Vn+1 ) , called the contact bundle.\n\nAlternatively, this last may be seen as the pull\u2013back of the space V \u2217 (Vn+1 ) through the map\n\u0001\n\u03c0\nj1 (Vn+1 ) \u2212\u2192 Vn+1 . As such, C j1 (Vn+1 ) is, at the same\u0001time, a vector bundle over j1 (Vn+1 ) and\nan affine bundle over V \u2217 (Vn+1 ). The manifold C j1 (Vn+1 ) will be referred to coordinates t,\u0001q i , q\u0307 i , p\u0302i ,\nrelated in an obvious way to those in j1 (Vn+1 ) and in V \u2217 (Vn+1 ) . Every \u03c3 \u2208 C j1 (Vn+1 ) will be\ncalled a contact 1\u2013form over j1 (Vn+1 ).\n\n1.2. Non\u2013holonomic constraints. Let A denote an embedded submanifold of j1 (Vn+1 ), fibred\nover Vn+1 .

Infinitesimal deformations of sections. (i) Quite generally, given a section \u03b3 : R \u2192 Vn+1 ,\na (weak) deformation of \u03b3 is a 1\u2013parameter family of sections \u03b3 \u03be , \u03be \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) depending differentiably on \u03be and satisfying \u03b3 0 = \u03b3 .\nIn the presence of non\u2013holonomic constraints, a deformation \u03b3 \u03be is called admissible if and only\nif each section \u03b3 \u03be : R \u2192 Vn+1 is admissible in the sense of \u00a71.2.

Application to Constrained Variational Calculus\n2.1. Problem statement. As already mentioned, we shall consider a constrained abstract system\nB. Given a differentiable function L \u2208 F (A) on the space A (called the Lagrangian ) and denoted\nby \u03b3\u0302 the lift to A of an admissible evolution \u03b3 of the system, define the action functional\nZ\n(2.1)\nI [\u03b3] := L (t, q 1 , . . . , q n , z 1 , . . . , z r ) dt\n\u03b3\u0302\n\nWe intend to characterize the extremals (if at all) of the functional I [\u03b3] among all the admissible\nevolutions \u03b3 : [t0 , t1 ] \u2192 Vn+1 connecting two given configurations.\nAs we shall see, it turns out to be more convenient to approach the topic by defining an alternative\nvariational problem on the manifold C (A) and proving that, under suitable hypotheses, the latter\nis equivalent to the original one.\nRemark 2.1. The constrained variational problem based on the functional (2.1) may be also viewed\nas a typical optimal control problem.\nAs in \u00a71.2, the admissibility of a given evolution of B is expressed in local coordinates by equation\ni\nA\n(1.6), expressing the derivatives dq\ndt in terms of a smaller number of variables z , A = 1, . . . , r.\n1\nr\nTherefore, every concurrent assignment of both the values of z (t), . . . , z (t) and of a point in the\nevent space Vn+1 determines an admissible evolution of the system as the solution of the ordinary\ndifferential equations (1.6) with the given initial conditions. This makes the z A 's into the controllers\nof the evolution and, as such, they usually go in the literature under the name of controls.\nIn this sense, the search for the curves \u03b3\u0302 = \u03b3\u0302(t) along which the functional (2.1) takes its extremal\nvalues may be equivalently seen as the one for those particular controls which optimize the evolution\nof the system.\nActually,in the absence of specific assumptions on the nature of the manifold A, the functions\nA\nz (t), in themselves, have no invariant geometrical meaning.

There is another possible approach to the problem outlined in \u00a72.1, which is slightly different but completely equivalent to the one taken so far.\nApparently it just complicates matters without giving any significant advantage. On the other hand,\nit seems to be the most faithful translation of the original Pontryagin's treatment of the topic [6]\ninto the present geometrical context. Hence - at least for historical reasons - it is worth telling\nabout.\nThe algorithm relies on the following considerations:\n( i ) Given any section \u03b3 : [t0 , t1 ] \u2192 P of the bundle of affine scalars, let \u03b3\u0302 denote the restriction\nto L(Vn+1 ) of its jet\u2013extension.\nThe input data of the assigned problem are taken into account by the introduction of a notion of\nadmissibility for \u03b3 . This is accomplished by requiring the jet\u2013extension \u03b3\u0302 to belong to a submanifold\n\u00c2 of L(Vn+1 ), locally described by the equations\n(2.16)\n\nq\u0307 i = \u03c8 i (t, q i , z A ) ,\n\nu\u0307 = L (t, q i , z A )\n\nIn other words, the simultaneous assignment of both the kinetic constraints and the Lagrangian\nfunction are used to express the submanifold \u00c2 as the image l(A).\nIn this way, every admissible section q i = q i (t) in Vn+1 determines, up to the initial value u(t0 ),\na corresponding admissible section q i = q i (t), u = u(t) of P .\nCompared with the main approach, the present formulation just replaces the section l : A \u2192 L(A)\nwith the image space \u00c2 = l(A), viewed as a submanifold of L(Vn+1 ). As we have seen, the\nsubmanifold \u00c2 and, consequently, the section l are regarded as data of the problem and therefore\n\n\fON THE GAUGE STRUCTURE OF THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS WITH CONSTRAINTS\n\n19\n\nthe representation u\u0307 = L (t, q i , z A ) is affected only by passive gauge transformations. The same\nvariational problem is therefore bred by different submanifolds related one another by the action of\nthe gauge group.\n( ii ) Let us consider the constrained variational problem with fixed end\u2013points on the manifold\nL(Vn+1 ), based on the functional\nZ\n(2.17)\nI[\u03b3] := u\u0307 dt\n\u03b3\u0302\n\n\u03b3\u0302 denoting the jet\u2013extension of an admissible section \u03b3 : [t0 , t1 ] \u2192 P . The stated problem does not\ndepend on a particular choice of the gauge, as the 1\u2013form u\u0307 dt is well\u2013defined in L(Vn+1 ) up to a\nterm f \u0307 dt.\nIn local coordinates, setting \u03b3 : q i = q i (t) , u = u(t), we have\nZ\nu\u0307 dt = u(t1 ) \u2212 u(t0 )\n\u03b3\u0302\n\nq i (t\n\ni\nand so, being the values of\n0 ) and q (t1 ) already fixed by the boundary conditions, the problem\nconsists in finding a curve \u03b3 over which the increment u(t1 ) \u2212 u(t0 ) becomes stationary and whose\nprojection onto Vn+1 joins the assigned end\u2013points.\n\n( iii ) The submanifold \u00c2 \u2192 L(Vn+1 ) is lifted up onto a submanifold C (\u00c2) \u2192 S whether by\nidentifying C (\u00c2) with the image space l\u0303(C (A)) or by pulling back S onto \u00c2 by means of the\ncommutative diagram\n\uf6be\u0303\n\n(2.18)\n\nC (\u00c2) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\u00c2\n\n\uf6be\u0303\n\n\uf6be\n\nS\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L(Vn+1 )\n\nAll the same, the embedding C (\u00c2) \u2212\u2192 S is fibred onto \u03a0(Vn+1 ) and its expression in coordinate\nis formally identical to equations (2.16) which are involved in the representation of the submanifold\n\u00c2.\nIt is now possible to make use of the form (1.43) to provide the manifold C (\u00c2) with the 1\u2013form\n\u0001\n(2.19)\n\uf6be\u0303 \u2217 (\u0398u ) = L dt + pi dq i \u2212 \u03c8 i dt\n\nand, as a consequence, to define an action integral by the integration of (2.19) along any section\n\u03b3\u030c : [t0 , t1 ] \u2192 C (\u00c2).\nOnce again, this merely reproduces in the image space C (\u00c2) the construction previously carried\non in \u00a7 1.5. In other words, the 1\u2013form (2.19) is simply the image of the Pontryagin\u2013Poincar\u00e9\u2013\nCartan form (1.50) under the diffeomorphism l\u0303 : C (A) \u2192 C (\u00c2).\n2.3.

Every normal extremal \u03b3 of the functional (2.1) is the projection of exactly one\nextremal \u03b3\u0303 of the functional (2.5).\nProof. The crucial point, that we will not demonstrate here, is that the normal curves form a subset\nof the ordinary ones.2\nIn view of Theorem 2.1, this entails the extremal \u03b3 to be the projection of at least one extremal\n\u03b3\u0303 : q i = q i (t), z A = z A (t), pi = pi (t) of the functional (2.5). We still have to prove its uniqueness.\nTo this end, we suppose the existence of a second extremal projecting onto \u03b3, expressed in coordinate\nas \u03b3\u0303 \u2032 : q i = q i (t), z A = z A (t), pi = \u03c4i (t).\nTaking equations (2.21) into account, it is easily seen that the contemporaneous validity of the\nEuler\u2013Lagrange equations for both the curves \u03b3\u0303 and \u03b3\u0303 \u2032\ndq i\n= \u03c8 i (t, q i , z A ) ,\ndt\n\ndpi\n\u2202\u03c8 k\n\u2202L\n+ pk\n=\n,\ndt\n\u2202q i\n\u2202q i\n\npk\n\n\u2202\u03c8 k\n\u2202L\n=\n\u2202z A\n\u2202z A\n\ndq i\n= \u03c8 i (t, q i , z A ) ,\ndt\n\nd\u03c4i\n\u2202\u03c8 k\n\u2202L\n+ \u03c4k\n=\n,\ni\ndt\n\u2202q\n\u2202q i\n\n\u03c4k\n\n\u2202\u03c8 k\n\u2202L\n=\nA\n\u2202z\n\u2202z A\n\nmakes the curve q i = q i (t), z A = z A (t), pi = pi (t) \u2212 \u03c4i (t) an extremal of the functional (2.20).\nSince \u03b3 is - by hypothesis - a normal curve, this implies pi (t) = \u03c4i (t) and hence \u03b3\u0303 \u2261 \u03b3\u0303 \u2032 .\n2See [1], Appendix B.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE GAUGE STRUCTURE OF THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS WITH CONSTRAINTS\n\n21\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
