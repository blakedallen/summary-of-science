While mechanisms of cooperativity have been studied most extensively in the\ncontext of transcriptional initiation control, cooperativity from other processes involved in the\noperation of the circuits can also play important roles. In this study, we examine a simple kinetic\nsource of cooperativity stemming from the nonlinear degradation of multimeric proteins. Ample\nexperimental evidence suggests that protein subunits can degrade less rapidly when associated in\nmultimeric complexes, an effect we refer to as \"cooperative stability\". For dimeric transcription\nfactors, this effect leads to a concentration-dependence in the degradation rate because\nmonomers, which are predominant at low concentrations, will be more rapidly degraded. Thus\ncooperative stability can effectively widen the accessible range of protein levels in vivo. Through\ntheoretical analysis of two exemplary genetic circuits in bacteria, we show that such an increased\nrange is important for the robust operation of genetic circuits as well as their evolvability. Our\ncalculations demonstrate that a few-fold difference between the degradation rate of monomers\nand dimers can already enhance the function of these circuits substantially. These results suggest\nthat cooperative stability needs to be considered explicitly and characterized quantitatively in any\nsystematic experimental or theoretical study of gene circuits.\n\n\f2\n\nIt is well known that the expression of genes can be regulated at a number of different stages,\nincluding transcriptional, translational, and post-translational controls. The predominant focus of\nmany experimental and theoretical studies on genetic circuits thus far has been on the\ncombinatorial control of transcriptional initiation, which to a large extent determines the\nconnectivity of the circuits (1-3). Substantial efforts have also been invested in elucidating the\nregulatory processes that control protein degradation (4). Such processes include the covalent\nmodification of one protein by another or the binding of one protein with another, resulting in\naltered turnover rates for the proteins involved (5). One consequence of an altered protein\nturnover rate is a shift in the steady-state cellular concentration of that protein depending on the\npresence/absence of other proteins. Thus, degradation control provides an additional way of\nestablishing connections between the genes in genetic circuits. This mode of control is often used\nby cells when the timescale of the response is required to be short. For instance, an increase in\nthe degradation rate allows the rapid removal of protein products (6) or conversely, protection\nfrom degradation provides a rapid way of accumulating the protein (7).\nIn this study, we examine an effect of protein degradation that does not involve regulatory\ncontrol but can nevertheless impact the operation of genetic circuits in important ways. It is a\nkinetic, cooperative effect predicated on two essential ingredients: (i) the fact that many proteins\nperform their physiological functions as dimers or higher-order oligomers, and (ii) the tendency\nfor the oligomers to be more stable (to proteolysis) than their monomeric components. This\neffect, referred to below as \"cooperative stability\", has been discussed previously in qualitative\nterms in the context of many well-studied examples in prokaryotes and eukaryotes; see reviews\nby Gottesman & Maurizi (4) and Jenal & Hennge-Aronis (5). For example, in the SOS response\nof E. coli, UmuC degradation is rescued by oligomerization with UmuD'2 (8). And in S.\ncerevisiae, Johnson et al (9) showed that the dimerization of the mating-type factors a1 and \u03b12\nreduced the degradation rate by as much as 15-fold. Possible molecular mechanisms giving rise\nto cooperative stability include enhanced thermal stability of proteins upon mutual association\n[since thermal instability correlates with the rate of degradation (10,11)], and the burial of\nproteolytic recognition sequences between protein interfaces (9).\nWhile most of the previous studies of cooperative stability focused on protein complexes\nwith heterogeneous protein subunits, we study here its effect for typical transcription factors\n\n\f3\n\n(TFs) that exert their biological functions only as homodimers (12). If such dimers are intended\nto operate at two concentrations, e.g., a \"low\" and a \"high\" concentration, then cooperative\nstability can widen the ratio between the two concentrations in vivo. This is a simple effect due to\nthe nonlinear dependence of the protein degradation rate on the concentration, i.e., enhanced\ndegradation rate at low concentrations due to the predominance of monomers, or alternatively,\nthe enhanced stability of dimers that are predominant at high concentrations. Through theoretical\nanalysis of two model gene circuits in bacteria, we will illustrate that cooperative stability can\nsignificantly enhance the function of these circuits. Specifically, we show that a several-fold\neffect in cooperative stability can make gene circuits more robust to stochastic fluctuations while\nalso broadening the basin of parameter space supporting circuit function. The latter enhances the\nevolvability of the circuit.\n\nCIRCUITS AND MODELS\nIn this study, we analyze two basic genetic circuits, one that displays bistability and the other\nspontaneous oscillation, two important classes of behavior in biomolecular circuits. The first\ncircuit consists of only a single gene with the gene product activating its own transcription, see\nFig. 1a. This is one of the simplest circuits that can produce two stable states (at LOW and HIGH\nlevels of transcriptional activities), as was shown by theoretical analysis and an experimental\nimplementation in E. coli (13). The second circuit we analyze consists of three genes connected\nin a ring topology, each repressing the transcription of its downstream partner, see Fig. 1b.\nElowitz and Leibler (14) have shown both theoretically and experimentally that this\n\"repressilator\" can spontaneously oscillate.\nRather than model these circuits in full detail, our goal here is to use these circuits to identify\ngeneric effects that cooperative stability imparts to their functions. Accordingly, we use simple\nquantitative models and describe each circuit by only a few essential parameters, so that the\neffects of cooperative stability can be characterized. Fig. 2 summarizes the biochemical\nprocesses considered in our model together with the associated rates. We describe the net change\nin the mRNA concentration due to transcription and turnover by the simple rate equation\n\n\f4\n\ndm\n= \u03b1 \u22c5 g([TF]) \u2212 \u03bbm \u22c5 m ,\ndt\n\n[1]\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the transcription rate of the promoter at full activation, g([TF]) describes the\npromoter activity as a function of the transcription factor concentration [TF] (see Fig. 3), and \u03bbm\nis the degradation rate of mRNA. Similarly, the net change in total protein concentration p is\ndp\n= \u03bd \u22c5 m \u2212 ( \u03bb p1 \u22c5 p1 + 2 \u03bb p2 \u22c5 p2 ) ,\ndt\n\n[2]\n\nwhere \u03bd denotes the translation rate of mRNA. In the turnover term, the total protein\nconcentration p = p1 + 2 p2 is partitioned into monomers and dimers with concentrations\np1 and p2 , and with turnover rates \u03bb p1 and \u03bb p2 respectively. Note that the turnover term in Eq. 2\n\nis linear in p when \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p 2 , and becomes nonlinear in p with cooperative stability ( \u03bb p1 > \u03bb p2 ).\nThe protein products involved in our genetic circuits are all transcription factors, and as is\noften the case in bacteria, they function as activators or repressors only in the form of\nhomodimers. Dimerization is assumed to be rapid, so that\np2 =\n\np12\nKd\n\n[3]\n\nwith K d being the equilibrium dissociation constant.\nThroughout this study, we do not explicitly include the stochastic effects of transcription,\ntranslation, and dimerization. Stochastic fluctuations are dominant when the mRNA or protein\nconcentrations are low (19-21). Nevertheless, our formulation Eqs. 1-3 ensures (22) that the\nresults we obtain correspond to the statistically-averaged results of more complex models that do\ninclude these stochastic effects. The advantage of our approach is that it allows us to rapidly\nelucidate the average behavior of each circuit for all combinations of its parameters. By\ndemanding that the average protein concentrations not be too small, we can identify those\n\n\f5\n\n(desirable) combinations of parameters for which the circuit behavior is mostly insensitive to\nstochastic effects.\n\nRESULTS\nFor each circuit shown in Fig. 1a and 1b, we want to identify the effect of cooperative stability\non its phenotypic behavior using the quantitative model described above. Towards this end, we\nfirst determine the parameter regimes where the circuits are operational (i.e. bistable or\noscillatory) without cooperative stability ( \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p 2 ), and then with cooperative stability\n( \u03bb p1 > \u03bb p2 ). For the latter case, we make the (reasonable) assumption that dimer turnover occurs\nmainly by cell growth/dilution, while monomers can experience accelerated degradation. Thus\nwe take the typical half-life of dimers to be of the order of the cell doubling time (~ 50 min for\nbacteria in the exponential growth phase), whereas the typical half-life of monomers can be\nshortened to a few minutes.\nBistable circuit\nSince this circuit consists of a single gene with positive autoregulation, and only dimers can\nactivate transcription, the promoter activity increases with the dimer concentration. This is\nindicated by the promoter activity function gA sketched in Fig. 3a, with [TF] = p2 . For any initial\nmRNA and protein concentration, this circuit will settle into a steady state given by the condition\n\n\u03b3 \u22c5 g A ( p2 *) = \u03bb p1 \u22c5 K d p2 * + 2\u03bb p2 \u22c5 p2 *\n\n[4]\n\nwhere p2 * denotes the steady-state dimer concentration and \u03b3 = \u03b1 \u22c5 \u03bd \u03bb m is the protein\nsynthesis rate of this gene at full activation. Eq. 4 is a simple statement that at steady state, the\nprotein synthesis rate (left hand side) must balance the protein degradation rate (right hand side).\nRegime of bistability. Bistability results when Eq. 4 has two stable solutions for p2 * , so that the\ngene can settle in either a HIGH or LOW state depending on the initial condition. This property\n\n\f6\n\nis dependent on the parameters \u03b3 , K d and the \u03bb p 's, as well as the shape of the promoter\nactivity function gA ( p2 ) . The activity function shown in Fig. 3a is characterized by three\nparameters: (i) f, the fold-change in promoter activity between the basal and fully-activated\nlevels, (ii) \u03ba , the TF concentration where the promoter activity begins to saturate, and (iii) n, the\neffective Hill coefficient which characterizes the cooperativity of the promoter activity function;\nsee Supporting Information. Among these parameters, \u03ba and \u03b3 can easily be varied over several\norders of magnitude via choices of the operator (23) and the ribosomal binding sequences (24)\nrespectively (we refer to these parameters as programmable). In contrast, the parameters f, n,\nand K d tend to be more constrained physiologically. For example, while there is no intrinsic\nbiochemical constraint for K d to be small, values around K d \u2248 10 nM nevertheless appear to be\ntypical according to in vitro measurements*, e.g., K d \u2248 20 nM for \u03bbCI (25), K d \u2248 8 nM for Arc\n(26), K d \u2248 10 nM for NtrC (27), and K d \u2248 1 nM for Crp (28); however, see footnote in Table 1.\nThe physiological range for all of the parameters used in our model is described in Table 1. As\nour goal is to study the circuit behavior for parameters within the typical physiological regime,\nwe will analyze the circuit behavior over a wide range of values in \u03ba and \u03b3 , but only for a few\nrepresentative values of f , n , and K d .\nThe bistability of the circuit depends only on certain combinations of the parameters, see\nSupporting Information. It is revealing to plot the regime of bistability as a function of the\nprogrammable parameters, using the parameter combinations K d / \u03ba and \u03b3 / (\u03ba \u03bb p2 ) on the x- and\ny-axes, respectively, see Fig. 4a. The remaining parameters are fixed at n = 1 and f = 100 ,\nwhich corresponds to a strong activator (e.g., Crp) with a single operator site.\nCircuit without cooperative stability. For \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p2 , the corresponding bistable regime is the\nnarrow black strip at the lower right corner of Fig.4a. With a given value of K d , the black region\n\n*\n\nThe effective value of K d in vivo is expected to increase with respect to its in vitro value due to dimer turnover.\n\nThe amount of increase depends on the dimer association and dissociation rates k a and k d . We find\nK d = (k d + \u03bb p 2 ) k a instead of the usual in vitro expression K d = k d k a . However, for typical small proteins, this\n\nincrease is estimated to be less than ~ 1 nM and hence not important for this discussion; see Supporting Information.\n\n\f7\n\ndefines an acceptable range of \u03b3 for each value of \u03ba . The circuit behavior within the bistable\nregime is demonstrated in Fig. 4b by plotting the steady-state monomer and dimer concentrations\n(grey and black curves respectively) in the HIGH and the LOW state (solid and dashed lines) as\na function of \u03ba , using the typical dimer dissociation constant of K d = 10 nM. Note that the\nsteady-state TF concentrations are very low, not exceeding p2 * ~ 10 nM, which corresponds to\nabout 10 molecules per bacterial cell. Such low concentrations are difficult to maintain reliably\nin the cell\u2020, and the circuit will be susceptible to various sources of stochastic fluctuations (40).\nSimilar results are obtained using our model with f = 11 and n \u2248 1.7 , which mimics the bistable\ncircuit studied experimentally by Isaacs et al (13); see Fig. S2 and S4 in Supporting Information.\nWe note that strong fluctuations were indeed observed in that experiment.\nThe steady-state protein concentrations could in principle be increased (consequently\nreducing stochastic effects) for larger values of K d , e.g. K d = 1000 nM as shown in Fig. 4c. In\nthis case, however, the concentrations of the nonfunctional monomers (grey curves) are\nsignificantly larger than the concentrations of functional dimers (black curves). Indeed, without\ncooperative stability, monomer overproduction is a generic consequence of leveraging\ncooperativity from dimerization since the system can only exploit this source of cooperativity\nwhen the total protein concentration is much less than K d (i.e. when the protein exists primarily\nin monomer form). While the overproduction of monomers may or may not be detrimental to the\ncell for an individual gene, the monomer \"load\" can become a significant problem if weak\ndimerization is a generic strategy widely adopted by the cell, e.g., if every regulatory gene\ncontributes 10 ~100 nonfunctional monomers in the LOW or HIGH states. This observation is a\nconceivable explanation for the small K d values found for typical dimeric proteins.\nEffect of cooperative stability. The grey and the hatched areas in Fig. 4a show how the bistable\nparameter regime is shifted when cooperative stability is introduced with \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 3\nand \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 10 , respectively. For a given value of K d , cooperative stability leads to a shift in\nthe bistable regime towards an increased rate of protein synthesis \u03b3 . By increasing the protein\n\n\u2020\n\nVilar & Leibler suggest that with DNA looping it may be possible to reduce this noise even with low numbers of\nmolecules (39)\n\n\f8\n\nconcentration, an increased \u03b3 reduces the susceptibility of the bistable circuit to stochastic\nfluctuations. This increase is seen explicitly in Fig. 4d, where we plot again the steady-state\nmonomer and dimer concentrations in the HIGH and LOW states with the typical K d = 10 nM\nas in Fig. 4b, but this time with 10-fold cooperative stability ( \u03bb p1 = 10 \u22c5 \u03bb p2 ). Comparison of Fig.\n4d to Fig. 4c demonstrates a second beneficial effect of cooperative stability: a significant\nreduction of the monomer load.\nThe origin of the beneficial effects of cooperative stability is that it extends the regime of\nprotein concentrations where cooperativity is obtained through dimerization from p < K d where\n\n(\n\n)\n\n2\n\nmost of the proteins are monomers, to p < K d \u22c5 \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p2 , see Eq. S12 in Supporting\nInformation. This results in an effective decrease in the value of K d needed for bistability by a\n\n(\n\n)\n\n2\n\nfactor of \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p2 . The grey and hatched regions in Fig. 4a can be viewed as the black region\nwith an appropriate reduction in K d . Moreover, for the case shown in Fig. 4d with K d = 10 nM\nand 10-fold cooperative stability, the dimer concentrations (black curves) are identical to those in\nFig. 4c, which were obtained for K d = 1000 nM and \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p 2 . The same black curve could also\nbe obtained for K d = 100 nM and ~ 3-fold cooperative stability (not shown). Due to this large\n\n(\u03bb\n\n)\n\n2\n\np1\n\n/ \u03bb p2 -fold reduction in K d , we expect a few-fold effect in cooperative stability to exert a\n\nlarge impact on circuit function.\nThree-gene oscillator\nIn the repressillator circuit of Fig. 1b, we have 3 genes whose mRNA and protein products,\nm( i ) and p ( i ) with i \u2208{1,2,3} , are described by Eqs. 1-3. To focus on the generic behavior of this\n\ncircuit, it is useful to assume that all 3 genes have identical properties, i.e. the same promoter\nstructure, synthesis/turnover rates, and dissociation constant K d for protein dimerization (14).\nThe form of the repressive promoter activity g R is shown in Fig.3b, and is characterized again by\nthe three parameters f , \u03ba , and n . We will examine in detail promoters with a single repressive\noperator site with n = 1 ; see Fig.1e.\n\n\f9\n\nOscillatory regime. The regime of parameter space supporting oscillation is obtained by linear\nstability analysis around the steady-state solution with {dm( i ) / dt = 0} and {dp ( i ) / dt = 0} ; see\nSupporting Information for details. Generally, oscillation is favored when (i) the fold-change f is\nlarge, (ii) the protein and mRNA turnover rates are comparable, and (iii) there is a large\ncooperativity/nonlinearity in synthesis and/or degradation; see also ref. (14).\nCircuit without cooperative stability. For \u03bb p \u2261 \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p2 , we show in Fig. 5a the oscillatory\nparameter regime for typical (f = 100) and exceptionally strong (f = 1000) repressors, paired with\neither typical ( \u03bb p / \u03bbm = 0.1 ) or rapid ( \u03bb p / \u03bbm = 1 ) protein turnover. Even for the most favorable\ncombination, i.e. \u03bb p / \u03bbm = 1 and f = 1000, oscillation is not possible until K d / \u03ba >100. Thus, for\ntypical K d ~ 10 nM and typical \u03ba of 1~1000 nM, this system cannot sustain oscillations. In the\nexperiment of Elowitz & Leibler (14), oscillation was obtained by (i) adding ssr-tags to the TFs\nso that they degrade much faster to make the protein and mRNA turnover rates comparable, and\n(ii) using some of the strongest repressive promoters known (30). The latter not only\nmakes f > 1000 , but the multiple repressive operator sites (shown in Fig. 1f) increase the value\nof the Hill-like coefficient associated with the transcription initiation to n \u2248 1.63 (see Supporting\nInformation), thereby further broadening the accessible parameter space. While the solution\nfound by Elowitz & Leibler (14) is a triumph of synthetic engineering, we believe that such\n\"extreme\" solutions will be difficult to find by natural evolution due to the rarity of existing\ncircuit components (e.g., promoters and TFs) with such extreme characteristics. The circuit\nwould be much more evolvable if oscillation can already occur for typical components, e.g., for\nTFs with \u03bb p / \u03bbm : 0.1 and promoters consisting of a single repressive operator site with f \u2264 100 .\nEffect of cooperative stability. By destabilizing the monomers with respect to the dimer species\nsuch that ( \u03bb p1 > \u03bb p2 ), cooperative stability will have two effects: First, as in the case of the selfactivating one-gene switch, it extends the regime where cooperativity is obtained through\n\n(\n\n)\n\n2\n\ndimerization from p < K d to p < K d \u22c5 \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p2 , thereby making the oscillatory regime more\naccessible to TFs with smaller K d . Second, the condition for oscillation favors the monomer\ndegradation rate be closer to the mRNA degradation rate; see Supporting Information. For\n\n\f10\n\ntypical gene products with \u03bb p2 / \u03bbm ~ 0.1 , a 10-fold effect in cooperative stability puts\n\n\u03bb p1 / \u03bbm close to unity, thereby further extending the oscillatory regime. This is illustrated in Fig.\n5b, where we specifically plotted the oscillatory regime for \u03bb p1 = \u03bbm = 10\u03bb p2 with both f = 100\nand f = 1000 . In comparison to the circuit without cooperative stability (Fig. 5a), oscillation is\nnow possible with typical molecular components.\n\nDISCUSSION\nAdvantages of cooperative stability\nIn this study, we examined the function of simple genetic circuits for dimeric TFs with various\ndegrees of cooperative stability, i.e., where monomers turnover more rapidly than the functional\ndimers. In the absence of cooperative stability, the desired operation of both the one-gene switch\nand the 3-gene oscillator requires parameters that are on the edge of what is physiologically\nrealizable. These limitations can be understood in simple terms: Proper functions of most\nbiological circuits require a sufficient degree of cooperativity in the circuit components.\nCooperativity at the transcription initiation stage (controlled by the fold-change f and the Hill\ncoefficient n in our model of transcriptional control) is usually quite limited. It is thus crucial to\nharness cooperativity from the other processes involved in the operation of gene circuits. A\nsimple and direct source of cooperativity that does not involve additional genes and proteins is\nthe nonlinearity in TF dimerization. In order to harness this cooperativity, however, it is\nnecessary to maintain the cellular TF level at or below the dimer dissociation constant K d . This\nwould leave the system with two undesirable options: Either use typical dimeric TFs with\nK d ~ 10 nM and maintain the TFs at a very low level (e.g., below 10 molecules per cell) which\n\nleaves the system vulnerable to stochastic fluctuations, or use TFs with large K d to maintain a\nhigher TF level (e.g., ~100 nM) to reduce these fluctuations, but expose the system to an\nincreased load of nonfunctional monomers. We have shown that cooperative stability removes\nthe link between the cellular TF levels and the K d values. This makes it possible to\n\nsimultaneously maintain a cellular TF level that is robust to fluctuations and allow the circuit to\n\n\f11\n\nharness dimer cooperativity for the typical (strong) dimers; the latter relieves the system of the\nmonomer load problem.\nImportantly, cooperative stability has broadened the parameter space for desired circuit\noperations, so that these circuits may be put together using typical components (TFs and\npromoters) without resorting to rare components with extreme properties. We suggest that this\nbroadening of the operable parameter space is not only useful in relaxing the design constraints\nin synthetic biology experiments, but is moreover crucial for such circuits to emerge from natural\nevolution: Evolvability of a circuit requires that before selection can exert any effect, it should be\npossible for the organism to spontaneously assemble a primitive circuit that can sustain some\nrudimentary operation conferring some limited fitness advantage (41). This possibility is much\nenhanced if the circuit can operate using components widely accessible to the cells. Of course,\ncooperative stability is not the only strategy to boost the degree of cooperativity needed for\ncircuit operations. There exist alternative strategies which may provide stronger cooperativity,\nincluding nonlinear feedback at the level of transcriptional and translational\ninitiation/termination as well as proteolytic control involving post-translational modifications.\nHowever, such processes require additional genes and proteins. They may be the final outcome\nof extended refinement of genetic circuits through a prolonged evolutionary process. In contrast,\ncooperative stability does not require any additional molecular components except for the\ndimeric protein itself. Moreover, as we will argue below, cooperative stability is itself a readily\nevolvable molecular trait for typical dimeric proteins. Therefore, it may be used at early stages of\nevolution to provide a circuit with some rudimentary functions beneficial to the host, so that\nselection can begin to exert some effect.\nIt is also interesting to note that for the genetic circuits studied, cooperative stability should\nresult in an increase in the robustness of circuit function to stochastic environmental fluctuations\nas well as an increase in the operational parameter space. The latter will make the circuit more\nrobust to mutational perturbations. The correlation between robustness against environmental\nand genetic perturbations, known as \"congruence\", has been proposed on general theoretical\nground (42, 43) but lacks direct experimental studies. Cooperative stability might provide a\nconcrete molecular system to study such phenomena. Conversely, congruence implies that\n\n\f12\n\nselection for the robustness of circuit function would naturally favor the use of proteins with\ncooperative stability due to the enhanced evolvability of the resulting circuit.\nMolecular mechanisms for cooperative stability\nIt remains to address how broadly cooperative stability may occur in nature, or alternatively\nput, how readily can cooperative stability be implemented molecularly if needed. We already\nmentioned in the Introduction a number of specific examples where oligomerization provides\nprotection against degradation. A recently characterized example involving homodimeric\nbacterial TF is TraR, a LuxR-family regulator whose homodimerization appears to require the\nautoinduer AI (44,45). Concomitantly, TraR is found to degrade rapidly in vivo in the absence of\nthe AI, but is stabilized (with over 30x longer half-life) in the presence of the AI (44). Here we\nsuggest that TraR is just one example of a large class of proteins that are prone to exhibit\ncooperative stability.\nWe note that many regulatory proteins are natively unfolded, and become folded and\nthermally stable only upon association with their targets (46). These include dimeric TFs which\nonly fold upon dimerization and are referred to as \"two-state dimers\" (47). The best studied\namong this class of proteins is the Arc repressor of phage P22 (26). As have been recently\ncharacterized (48,49), conspicuous molecular features of these two-state dimers include the large\nnumber of inter-monomer contacts (compared to intra-monomer contacts) and the\nhydrophobicity of the interfacial contacts. We conjecture that the two-state dimers are ideal\nmolecules for cooperative stability. First, unfolded monomers are generally believed to be more\nsusceptible to generic degradation (10,11). Second, their exposed hydrophobic surface patches\ncan be targeted by various proteases (33). Thus, disordered monomers may be an elegant way for\nnature to keep the LOW state low, while not disturbing the stable oligomers in the HIGH state.\nThe existence of a substantial number of two-state dimers suggests that these molecules may\nbe readily obtained evolutionarily should they be needed. This is supported by recent\nexperiments where upon deletion of a few residues at the end of the peptide, stably folded\nproteins can easily become natively unfolded (i.e., unfolded by itself), yet still fold upon target\npresentation (K. Plaxco, personal communication). This finding is consistent with the\nexpectation that peptide termini away from the interaction surface contribute toward the stability\n\n\f13\n\nof the monomers but not the complex. Together with our conjectured relation between two-state\ndimers and cooperative stability, it suggests that the degree of cooperative stability of dimeric\nproteins is readily tunable by simple terminal deletions. Thus, two-state dimers might be the\nfavorite component of evolution to assemble gene circuits or other regulatory systems.\nRamifications for experiment and modeling\nCooperative stability (i.e., \u03bb p1 > \u03bb p2 ) has certainly been used previously in genetic circuit\nmodeling, both in oscillators and bistable switches. In Drosophila, reduced protein degradation\nby multimerization has been suggested to play a significant role in the genetic circuit controlling\ncircadian rhythm (50,51). In the modeling of phage \u03bb's lysis/lysogeny system, cooperative\nstability was implicitly used but not always in consistent ways. For example, in their modeling of\nentry to lysogeny, Arkin et al (52) assumed that CI monomers were degraded with half-life of\n~15 min, and Cro monomers were degraded with half-life of ~ 5 min, while leaving the longlived dimers to dilution by cell growth. With a cell doubling time of ~30-50 min, these\nassumptions implicitly invoke cooperative stability with \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p2 \u2248 2 \u2212 3 for CI and\n\n\u03bb p1 / \u03bb p2 \u2248 6 \u2212 10 for Cro. On the other hand, in their analysis of the experimental results of\nLittle et al (53) [on the robustness of lysogeny to changes in the affinity of the CI-operator\nbinding], Aurell et al (54) and Zhu et al (55) assumed that monomers and dimers were degraded\nwith equal rates. These authors concluded that additional source(s) of cooperativity are needed to\nexplain the observed robustness. While the recent discovery of CI octamerization at PRM may\nprovide some of the necessary cooperativity (1,56,57), we suggest that cooperative stability\nmight be another possible source of cooperativity that needs to be examined critically. In fact,\nReinitz & Vaisnys (58) had speculated long ago that concentration-dependent degradation of Cro\n(as suggested by the data of Pakula & Sauer (59)) might provide some of the cooperativity\nneeded to reconcile the discrepancies between theory and experiment. Given the strong impact\nthat even a modest degree of cooperative stability can make on the phase diagram and the circuit\nstability (see Figs. 4 and 5), knowledge of the monomer/dimer turnover rates is crucial to guide\nquantitative studies of the \u03bb-switch and to help resolve puzzles regarding the stability and\nrobustness of lysogeny.\n\n\f14\n\nMore generally, we note that in the current genetic circuit modeling literature, the lack of\nattention paid to monomer/dimer degradation has resulted in various models being\nunintentionally locked into forms that assume either no cooperative stability (i.e., \u03bb p1 = \u03bb p 2 ) or\nextreme cooperative stability (i.e., \u03bb p2 = 0 ). We hope that our demonstration of the large impact\nof cooperative stability on circuit operation will motivate the modeling community to be more\nattentive to the quantitative treatment of degradation in future studies. On the experimental side,\nthe addition of ssrA-tag on proteins has been widely used to control the turnover rate and hence\nthe time scale of synthetic genetic circuits (14,60,61). However, depending on the degradation\nmode of the ssrA-tagged proteins (e.g., whether the monomers are preferentially degraded, or\nwhether the turnover of both monomers and dimers are equally enhanced), ssrA-tagging could\nproduce unexpected effects on the function of the circuits.\nClearly, cooperative stability needs to be investigated quantitatively in the context of specific\ntranscriptional systems in order to establish the extent this mechanism is used in nature. Here we\nstress that the ubiquity of molecules (i.e., the two-state dimers) with potential for cooperative\nstability and the magnitude of impact this effect can exert on the operation of genetic circuits\nmake it necessary to characterize and address its possible effects systematically in any\nexperimental or theoretical study of genetic circuits. The generic effect of cooperative stability\ndescribed here, e.g., in reducing the basal level of active proteins and consequently amplifying\ncontrol signals, provides a striking example of how biophysical properties at the molecular scale\ncan directly impact high-level function of biomolecular networks. The effect is not limited to the\nnonlinear degradation of dimeric transcription factors or to the specific context of genetic\ncircuits. We expect similar nonlinear effects to extend to protein modifications in signaling\nnetworks and co-regulated components of multimeric protein complexes.\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to R.

Maximum protein\nsynthesis rate is limited by the rate of elongation of the ribosome. In bacteria, the elongation rate of ribosome is ~20\ncodons/sec and ribosomes occlude ~10 codons (34). Thus, the absolute maximum rate of protein synthesis per\nmRNA is ~120 proteins/min. Typical genes in bacteria have on average ~2 mRNA per cell (32), so that even with an\noptimal RBS, the maximum \u03b3 is less than ~240 nM/min. For proteins that are diluted through cell division (~50\nmins), this range of \u03b3 produces steady-state protein concentrations of 0~10,000 nM.\n(d)\nA number of bacterial TFs, e.g., BlaI (35), FIS (27), and CopR (36) have K d in the \u03bcM range. However, they are\nall \"atypical\" regulatory proteins whose in vivo concentrations in the active state exceed the order of 10 \u03bcM (35-37).\nHowever, it is generally believed that the over-expression of many TFs can be deleterious to the cells. For example,\nthe maximum concentration for typical TFs in bacteria is not much more than ~100 nM; even the global regulator\nCrp is present only at ~1,500 nM (38). Thus, typical bacterial TFs tend to be at lower concentrations in vivo and tend\nto have smaller K d .\n\n\f20\n\nFigure 1: Two simple genetic circuits capable of (a) bistability and (b) oscillation. Genetic\ncircuits consist of genes (drawn as circles) that regulate the transcriptional activity of one\nanother. This regulation can be activating (arrow) or repressive (blunt line).

Transcription is governed by the transcription rate \u03b1 \u22c5 g([TF ]) and\n\u03b1 is the mRNA synthesis rate at full activation. Each mRNA is translated into protein monomer\nat a rate \u03bd, and degraded at a rate \u03bbm . The cellular concentrations of monomers ( p1 ) and dimers\n( p2 ) are related by the dimer dissociation constant K d . The protein degradation rate can be\ndifferent for monomers ( \u03bb p1 ) and dimers ( \u03bb p2 ).\n\n\f22\n\nFigure 3: Log-log plot of the relative promoter activity g([TF]) versus the transcription factor\nconcentration [TF], for (a) activation and (b) repression. The general expression for the promoter\nactivity function is written above each plot. The peak activity of a promoter is defined to be 1,\nthe fold-change between LOW and HIGH plateaus is described by f, and the DNA-binding\ndissociation constant of a TF for its operator \u03ba is the concentration which separates the HIGH\nplateau from the transition region. The log-log slope (s) of the transition region (referred to as\n\"sensitivity\" in the signal transduction literature (15)) quantifies the degree of cooperativity in\ntranscriptional control. It is controlled by the Hill coefficient n and the maximum fold-change f,\nwith maximum s approaching n for large f; see Supporting Information. Both (a) and (b) are\napproximations to promoter activity functions derived from detailed thermodynamic treatment of\ntranscription initiation; see Supporting Information and refs. (3,16-19).\n.\n\n\f23\n\nFigure 4: Quantitative characteristics of the bistable circuit with a single operator promoter\n\n( n = 1 ) and a strong activator ( f = 100 ). (a) Regime of bistability in the parameter space for the\ncircuit with linear degradation ( \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 1 ) and with cooperative stability ( \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 > 1 ).

For both p1 * and p2 * , the solid curve is the concentration in the HIGH state and the\ndashed curve is the concentration in the LOW state. (d) Same plot as (b) for the circuit with\ncooperative stability ( \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 10 ).\n\n\f24\n\nFigure 5: Quantitative characteristics of the three-gene oscillator involving repressor binding to\na single operator site (n=1). (a) Oscillatory regime (shaded regions) in the parameter space for\nthe case of linear degradation (\u03bb p1 = \u03bb p2 ) , using \u03bb p2 / \u03bbm ={0.1,1} and f ={100,1000},\nrepresenting {typical, rare} values, respectively (with the same parameter combinations on the\naxes as in Fig. 4). For ( \u03bb p2 \u03bbm , f ) =(0.1,100), sustained oscillation is not possible within the\nphysiological parameter range being shown. (b) For the circuit with cooperative\nstability ( \u03bb p1 = 10\u03bb p2 ) , we plot in the same parameter space the oscillatory regime with typical\ndimer/mRNA degradation rates ( \u03bb p 2 / \u03bbm = 0.1), at the fixed repression strengths f = 100\n(black) and f = 1000 (grey). A significant part of the accessible parameter space now displays\noscillatory behavior.\n\n\f25\n\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nDimer dissociation constant in vitro and in vivo\nThe dimer dissociation constant K d is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the\nmonomers ( p1 ) and dimers ( p2 ) in steady state, i.e., K d = p12 p2 . In terms of the basic kinetic\nparameters, the association rate ka and the dissociation rate k d , the in vitro dissociation constant\nis simply K d(0) = kd ka . However, the effective value of Kd is modified in vivo due to a variety of\nprocesses, including those that change the rate constants k. Even if the rate constants do not\nchange, Kd will also be affected by proteolysis or dilution, which alter the steady-state cellular\nprotein concentrations. In the latter case, the combined effects of all these processes can be\ndescribed at the level of chemical kinetics by the equations\n\ndp1\ndt\n\n= \u03b3 \u2212 \u03bb p1 \u22c5 p1 \u2212 2ka p12 + 2kd p2\n\ndp2\n= \u2212 \u03bb p 2 \u22c5 p2 + ka p12 \u2212 kd p2\ndt\n\n[S1]\n\n[S2]\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the protein synthesis rate and \u03bb p1 , \u03bb p2 are the monomer, dimer degradation rates\nrespectively; see the main text. The steady-state solution of Eq. S2 is ( \u03bb p2 + kd ) \u22c5 p2 = ka p12 ,\nwhich according to the definition of the dissociation constant given above, yields an expression\nfor the in vivo dissociation constant\n\nKd =\n\nkd + \u03bb p2\nka\n\n= K d(0) +\n\n\u03bb p2\nka\n\n.\n\n[S3]\n\nNote that the in vivo Kd is independent of \u03bb p1 , hence it does not depend on whether the\nprotein is cooperatively stable (i.e., whether \u03bb p1 and \u03bb p2 are equal or different). As shown in Eq.\n\n\f26\n\nS3, Kd is larger than the corresponding in vitro value K d(0) . Assuming that many dimers are\ndiluted by cell division in the rapid exponential growth phase (~ 50 min half-life), then we can\nuse typical monomer-monomer association rate of ka\u22121 ~ 20 nM-min for small proteins (1, 2) to\nestimate a typical order of magnitude for the offset \u03bb p 2 k a to be ~ 0.3 nM. Shifts of this\nmagnitude in Kd are marginally relevant for typical TFs with K d(0) ~ 10 nM, but they can become\nquite significant for larger proteins (e.g., enzymes) that have smaller ka or proteins that are\nrapidly degraded by proteolysis, see Table 1.\n\nThermodynamic models of transcriptional control\nIn the text, we used the effective Hill functions\n\ng A ([TF ]) \u2248\n\ng R ([TF ]) \u2248\n\n(\n)\n1 + ([TF ] \u03ba )\n\nf \u22121 + [TF ] \u03ba\n\nn\n\nn\n\n(\n\n1 + [TF ] \u03ba\n\n(\n\n)\n\nn\n\n1 + [TF ] \u03ba\n\nf\n\n)\n\nn\n\n[S4]\n\n[S5]\n\nto describe the activities of the promoters shown in Fig. 1c-f. In this description, promoter\nactivity is effectively characterized by three numbers, see Fig. 3: (i) f which defines the\nmaximum fold-change in promoter activity, (ii) \u03ba which indicates the concentration that\nseparates the HIGH plateau from the transition region, and (iii) the \"Hill coefficient\" n which\ndescribes the transcriptional cooperativity in the transition region. Here, we use a more realistic\ndescription of the promoter activity based on the thermodynamic models of transcriptional\ninitiation (3,4,5), and relate the effective parameters used in Eqs. S4 and S5 to the biochemical\nparameters controlling protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. We stress that our results\nwhich follow all implicitly presume that the promoters of interest are sufficiently weak (4,5).\n\n\f27\n\nSimple activation and repression. In the thermodynamic description, the promoter activity is\nassumed to be proportional to the equilibrium probability P that the RNA polymerase (RNAP)\nbinds to the core promoter. The dependence of P on cellular TF concentrations (TF) for the four\ncis-regulatory architectures shown in Fig. 1 has been calculated elsewhere (4,5). The single\nactivator (Fig. 1c) and repressor (Fig. 1e) promoters have the forms\n\nPact1 ([TF]) \u221d\n\n1+ \u03c9 A\u2212 P \u22c5[TF] / K A\n\nPrep1 ([TF]) \u221d\n\n1 + [TF] / K A\n1\n+L\n1 + [TF] / K R\n\n[S6]\n\n[S7]\n\nIn the above equations, KA and KR refer to the dissociation constant between the TF and the\nrespective operator sequence in vivo, \u03c9 A\u2212 P = exp( \u2212\u2206G A\u2212 P / RT ) is the Boltzmann weight of the\nactivator-RNAP interaction, and L describes the effect of \"promoter leakage\" in repression\nwhich is expected to occur even for [TF ] \u2192 \u221e \u2021.\n\nSince the effective promoter activity functions ( g A , g R ) shown in Eqs. S4 and S5 are simply\nPact1 , Prep1 normalized by their maximum values, one can compare Eqs. S4, S5 with S6, S7 to\n\nyield n=1 for both cases, with f = \u03c9 A \u2212 P and \u03ba = K A for the activator, and f = L\u22121 and \u03ba = K R\nfor the repressor. An important feature of the promoter activity function in the context of genetic\ncircuits is the sensitivity s, which is defined as the absolute value of the log-log slope of\ng([TF ]) , i.e.,\n\nsA =\n\nd ln g A\n.\nd ln[TF ]\n\nsR = \u2212\n\n\u2021\n\nd ln g R\n.\nd ln[TF ]\n\n[S8]\n\n[S9]\n\nFor instance, this may be due to the collision of the replication fork with the repressed promoter which occurs at\nleast once per cell cycle.\n\n\f28\n\nThey are plotted in Fig. S1a as a function of [TF ] / \u03ba for different values of f=10, 100, 1000 for\nthe activator and the repressor. Note that the maximum value of s([TF ]) , referred to here as s* ,\noccurs at the mid point of the transition region (see Fig. 3) and is strongly dependent on the\nmagnitude of the fold-change f. As shown in Fig. S1b, even at f = 100 , s*=0.82 is still below\nthe theoretical maximum set by n = 1 . Since large f is more readily available for repressors (due\nto the strong exclusion interaction between RNAP and the promoter-bound repressor), it is easier\nto attain large sensitivity using repressor-controlled promoters.\nCooperative activation. For the promoter shown in Fig. 1d involving two operators for the\nactivator, the corresponding promoter occupancy probability (4,5) is:\n\nPact 2 ([TF ]) \u221d\n\n1 + [TF ] / K H + \u03c9 A\u2212 P \u22c5[TF ] / K A + \u03c9 A\u2212 A \u22c5 \u03c9 A\u2212 P \u22c5[TF ]2 / ( K A \u22c5 K H )\n1 + [TF ] / K A + [TF ] / K H + \u03c9 A\u2212 A \u22c5[TF ]2 / ( K A \u22c5 K H )\n\n[S10]\n\nwhere KH refers to the in vivo dissociation constant of the TF to upstream \"helper\" operator, and\n\n\u03c9 A \u2212 A is the Boltzmann weight associated with activator-activator interaction. The form (S10) is\nclearly different from the Hill form (S4), and the values of the effective Hill parameters n and \u03ba\nwill necessarily depend on the actual values of the parameters KA, KH, \u03c9 A \u2212 P , and \u03c9 A \u2212 A . In the\nmain text, this promoter was used to model the PRM promoter of phage lambda studied\nexperimentally by Issacs et al (6). For this case, the primary and helper activator sites are the\noperators OR2 and OR1 respectively whereas we neglected the very weak repressive site OR3 (7).\nThe TF, lambda repressor protein CI, can stimulate transcription while bound at OR2\u00a7; the same\nTF can interact cooperatively with an adjacent TF bound upstream at OR1 (10).\n\n\u00a7\n\nThe stimulation of transcription by TFs (i.e. activation) typically described in thermodynamic models involves the\n\"thermodynamic recruitment\" of RNAP by the activator via a mutual attractive interaction (8). Transcriptional\nstimulation by CI involves instead catalyzing the rate of RNAP-promoter isomerization from a closed inactive form\nto an open active form (9). This change in isomerization rate, \u2206kiso , is mathematically equivalent to\n\"thermodynamic recruitment\" with \u03c9 A \u2212 P \u2248 \u2206kiso .\n\n\f29\n\nIt is well known that the transcriptional stimulation provided by CI at PRM is weak, with\n\n\u03c9 A\u2212 P \u2248 11 (9). The in vivo values of the CI-operator dissociation constants K A and K H are not\nknown, but their ratio is expected to be equivalent to the ratio of the in vitro dissociation\nconstants. The latter have been measured, together with the CI-CI affinity \u03c9 A \u2212 A . There are two\nsets of parameter values commonly used in the phage lambda literature: (i) Shea & Ackers\n(1985) (3) where K A K H \u2248 17 and \u03c9 A\u2212 A \u2248 25 , and (ii) Koblan & Ackers (1992) (11) where\nK A K H \u2248 25 and \u03c9 A \u2212 A \u2248 100 . In Fig. S2a, we plot the function Pact 2 (normalized by its\n\nmaximum value) against [TF ] / K H for the two sets of parameters (the solid black and grey\nlines). The two curves are then fit to the effective Hill form (S4) to extract the effective\nparameters: n \u2248 1.53 and \u03ba \u2248 1.22K H for SA85; and n \u2248 1.69 and \u03ba \u2248 0.64K H for KA92; see the\ndashed lines in Fig. S2a. In Fig. S2b, we plot the sensitivity function s A ([TF ]) for the two cases.\nWe see that despite the improved Hill cooperativity for this promoter ( n \u2248 1.5 \u2212 1.7 ), the\nmarginal fold-change f = 11 in activation limits the maximum sensitivity to s*A < 1 .\nDual repression. For the promoters controlled by two repressor sites (Fig. 1f), the corresponding\nactivity function (4,5) is given by\n\nPrep2 ([TF]) \u221d\n\n1\n+L\n(1 + [TF] / K R1 ) \u22c5 (1 + [TF] / K R2 )\n\n[S11]\n\nwhere KR1 and KR2 refer to the in vivo dissociation constants for the two operators, and L again\ndescribes promoter leakage. Examples of such cis-regulatory constructs are the very strongly\nrepressively controlled promoters constructed by Lutz & Bujard (12) with very low leakiness. In\nFig. S3a, we plot the relative activity function for K R1 = K R2 , and L = 10 \u22123 (solid line). The\ndashed line is the best fit to the Hill form (S5), with the effective parameters\nn = 1.63 , \u03ba \u2248 0.52K R1 , and f = L\u22121 . The sensitivity function sR ([TF ]) plays an important role in\n\nthe ring-oscillator circuit (as will be shown below); it is plotted in Fig. S3b. Owing to the large f,\n\ns*R is in this case close to its maximal theoretical value set by the Hill coefficient n = 1.63 .\n\n\f30\n\nBistability\nThis genetic circuit shown in Fig. 1a consists of a single gene, which encodes a protein that\nhomodimerizes and activates its own transcription. The steady-state occurs when degradation\nand synthesis rates are balanced, and is given by Eq. 4 or more conveniently by\n\n\u239b \u03b3 \u239e\n\u03bb p1 K d p2 *\np *\n\u22c5\n\u22c5\n+2 2\n\u239c\n\u239f \u22c5 g A ( p2 *) =\n\u03bb p2\n\u03ba \u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u239d \u03ba \u22c5 \u03bb p2 \u23a0\n\n[S12]\n\nwhere p2 * is the steady-state TF dimer concentration. Given the form of the promoter activity\nfunction gA, the above equation can be solved to yield the stable solutions p2 * \u03ba as a function\nof the dimensionless, programmable parameters, \u03b3 \u03ba \u22c5 \u03bb p2 and K d \u03ba for different choices of\n\n\u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 . For the promoter containing a single operator site (Fig. 1c), g A ( p2 *) is given by Eqn.\nS4 with n = 1 as discussed above. Solving Eqn. S12 using Mathematica 4.2 (13), we obtain\nvarious regimes of parameter space supporting bistability. Such regimes are plotted in Fig. 4a for\nf = 100 and \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 1,3,10 .\n\nThe above procedure is repeated for the promoter with double operators (Fig. 1d) which we\nuse as a model of the PRM promoter studied in the experiment of Issacs et al (6). The\ncorresponding promoter activity function is g A as sketched in Fig. S2a and described by the\napproximate Hill form (S4) with f \u2248 11 and n \u2248 1.7 . In Fig. S4, we again plot the bistable region\nin the space of the two programmable parameters ( \u03b3 \u03ba \u22c5 \u03bb p2 , K d \u03ba ) for \u03bb p1 \u03bb p2 = 1 . Despite\nthe improved Hill coefficient for this promoter when compared to the single operator promoter\ndiscussed above, the regime of bistability for both cases are similarly limited (compare the black\nband in Fig. S4 and Fig. 4a). This is a consequence of the small fold-change (f) involved in autoactivation of the PRM promoter studied by Isaacs et al. (6).\n\n\f31\n\nOscillation\nFor the repressillator circuit of Fig. 1b, we have 3 genes whose mRNA and (total) protein\nconcentrations are denoted by m( i ) and p ( i) with i \u2208{1,2,3} . An approximate picture of the\ncircuit behavior can be obtained by assuming that the 3 genes have the same properties, e.g., the\nsame promoter structure and the same synthesis/turnover rates (14). The circuit topology of Fig.\n1b then leads to the following kinetic equations\nd (i )\nm = \u03b1 g R ( p2(i \u22121) ) \u2212 \u03bbm m ( i )\ndt\n\n[S13]\n\nd (i )\np =\u03bd m (i ) \u2212 \u2206 ( p2(i ) )\ndt\n\n[S14]\n\n(\n\n)\n\nIn Eq. S13, the promoter activity function g R p2(i\u22121) is given by Eq. S5 and the functional TFs\nare again dimers (of concentration p2(i) for each species i), with p2(0) = p2(3) completing the circuit\nloop. We assume rapid equilibration between the monomers and dimers, such that the dimer and\ntotal protein concentrations are related by the condition\n\np=\n\nK d \u22c5 p2 + 2 p2\n\n[S15]\n\nfor each species. According to the spirit of our approximation, these dimers all have the same Kd.\nIn Eq. S14, we introduced the protein degradation function\n\u2206 = \u03bb p1 K d \u22c5 p2 + 2\u03bb p 2 p2\n\n[S16]\n\nwhich gives the total protein degradation rate.\nTo find the condition for oscillation for the system defined by Eqs. S13-S16, we follow the\nanalysis of Elowitz (15) and first solve for the steady-state concentrations {m (i ) = m* , p ( i ) = p* }\n2\n2\nsuch that the left-hand side of Eqs. S13-S14 are zero. This is given by the condition\n\n\f32\n\n(\n\n) ( )\n\n\u03b3 \u22c5 g R p2* / \u03ba = \u2206 p2*\n\nwhere \u03b3 =\n\n[S17]\n\n\u03b1 \u22c5\u03bd\n. We then analyze small perturbations about this steady state and find the\n\u03bbm\n\ncondition where undamped oscillatory solutions emerge (16). This amounts to finding the purely\nimaginary eigenvalues of the following Jacobian **:\n\n\u239b \u22121 0\n0\n0\n0 \u2212x \u239e\n\u239c 1 \u2212y 0\n0\n0\n0\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239c 0 \u2212x \u22121 0\n0\n0\u239f\nJ =\u239c\n\u239f\n0\n1 \u2212y 0\n0\u239f\n\u239c0\n\u239c0\n0\n0 \u2212x \u22121 0 \u239f\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d0\n0\n0\n0\n1 \u2212 y\u23a0\n\nwhere x = \u2212\n\n\u03b3 d\n\u22c5 g ( p ( p) )\n\u03bbm dp R 2\n\n, y = \u03bbm\u22121 \u22c5\np\n\n*\n\nd\n\u2206 ( p2 ( p ) )\ndp\n\n[S18]\n\n, and p2 ( p) is given by Eq. S15.\np*\n\nThe only acceptable solution of this system is given by the condition\n3( x / y )\n( y + 1) 2\n=\ny\n4 \u2212 2( x / y)\n2\n\n[S19]\n\nwhich can be alternatively expressed as x y = \u03c8 ( y) where\n\u239e\n(1 + y)2 \u239b\n12 y\n\u03c8 ( y) =\n\u2212\n1\n\u239c 1+\n\u239f.\n3y \u239d\n(1 + y)2\n\u23a0\n\n[S20]\n\nIt is straightforward to show that the steady-state solution is stable whenever x / y < \u03c8 ( y) .\nThus oscillation is not possible in this regime. For x / y > \u03c8 ( y) , we verified that the system\nremains in an oscillatory state by direct numerical integration of the kinetic Eqs. S13 and S14.\n**\n\nWe have rewritten Eqs. S13-S14 where the mRNA concentration and time have been rescaled to\n\nt \u22c5 \u03bbm .\n\nm \u22c5 \u03bd \u03bbm and\n\n\f33\n\nThe condition x y = \u03c8 ( y ) defines the boundary of the oscillatory phase. The function \u03c8 ( y) is\nplotted in Fig. S5 and the oscillatory region is shaded.\nFrom the form of \u03c8 ( y) , it is clear that no oscillation is possible if x / y < 4 / 3 . For\nx / y > 2 , oscillation will occur independently of y. For the intermediate range 4 / 3 < x / y < 2 ,\n\noscillation is most favorable for y \u2248 1 , i.e. the minimum of \u03c8 ( y) . To interpret the physical\nmeaning of these conditions, it is useful to note the relation\u2020\u2020\n\n( )\n( )\n\n*\nx sR p2\n=\ny r p2*\n\nwhere sR \u2261 \u2212\n\nd ln g R\nd ln p2\n\n[S21]\n\nis the sensitivity function, and r \u2261\np2*\n\nd ln \u2206\nd ln p2\n\nis the log-log slope of the\np2*\n\ndegradation function defined in Eq. S16. Eq. S21 shows that the function (i.e. oscillation) of the\ncircuit is intimately related to the sensitivity. Since 1 / 2 \u2264 r \u2264 1 , we conclude that oscillation will\n\n( )\n\nalways occur if sR p2* > 2 . However, this is hardly satisfied for typical promoters. On the other\nhand, we note that in the regime where r \u2248 1 / 2 (i.e., the degradation flux is predominantly\n\n( )\n\nthrough monomer loss), oscillation will always occur if sR p2* > 1 . This sensitivity is achievable\nby a promoter with two repressor sites (see Fig. S3b), but not for a promoter with a single\nrepressor site since sR < n = 1 (Fig. S1). For the latter promoter, oscillation can still occur if\n\n( )\n\nsR p2* > 2 / 3 and y is close to 1 (see Fig. S4).\nThe value of y is given explicitly by the model parameters as\n\n\u239b\u03bb\ny = \u239c p1\n\u239d \u03bbm\n\n\u2020\u2020\n\nKd\np2*\n\n+2\n\n\u03bb p2 \u239e\n\u239f\n\u03bbm \u23a0\n\n\u239e\n\u239b K\nd\n+\n2\n\u239f\n\u239c\n*\n\u23a0\n\u239d p2\n\n[S22]\n\nThis relation can be derived starting from the definition of x and y, by applying the chain-rule of differentiation\nand invoking the steady-state condition (S17).\n\n\f34\n\nThere are three regimes for y: (i) when p2 = K d (i.e. where monomers are the dominant\nspecies), then y = \u03bb p1 \u03bbm , and oscillation is most favorable in this regime if the mRNA and\n\n(\n\nmonomer degradation rates are comparable (where y \u2248 1). (ii) when K d = p2* = \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p 2\n\n)K\n2\n\nd\n\n(i.e. dimers are the dominant species, but degradative flux is still predominantly through the\nmonomers), then y \u2248\n\n\u03bb p1\n\u03bbm\n\nK d p2* , and depending on the steady-state dimer concentration p2* , y\n2\n\nspans the range \u03bb p 2 \u03bbm < y < \u03bb p1 \u03bbm . (iii) when p\n\n*\n2\n\n\u239b \u03bb p1 \u239e\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239f\u239f K d (dimers are the dominant\n\u03bb\n\u239d p2 \u23a0\n\nspecies and degradative flux is predominantly through dimers), then y = \u03bb p 2 \u03bbm . From the\nabove analysis, we see that cooperative stability (i.e., \u03bb p1 / \u03bb p 2 > 1 ) improves the condition for\noscillation by increasing the regime where degradation flux is monomer dominated, so that a\nlarge regime of parameter space is governed by r \u2248 1 / 2 and y \u2248 1.\n\nThis is illustrated explicitly in Fig. 5, where we plot the region of spontaneous oscillation as a\nfunction of the programmable parameters ( \u03b3 \u03ba \u22c5 \u03bb p 2 , K d \u03ba ) for different fixed ( \u03bb p1 \u03bb p 2 ,\n\n\u03bb p 2 \u03bbm ) using g R for the promoter containing a single repressor site with n = 1 and\nf = 100,1000 . The contour of oscillatory parameter space shown in Fig. 5 was generated using\n\nMathematica 4.2 (13) by first numerically solving Eq. S17 to obtain p2* for each set of\nparameters, then determining y and x / y according to their definitions, e.g., see Eq. S18, and\nfinally comparing to the oscillatory condition x / y > \u03c8 ( y) .\n\n\f35\n\nReferences:\n(1) Koren, R. & Hammes, G.G.
