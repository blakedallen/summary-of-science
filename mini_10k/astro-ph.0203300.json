In\ngeneric hierarchical clustering scenarios for galaxy formation, such as cold dark matter\ndominated cosmologies (White & Rees 1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984; Dekel & Silk 1986),\ndwarf galaxies should have formed prior to the epoch of giant galaxy formation and would\nbe the building blocks of larger galaxies. The dSphs observed today would be surviving\nobjects that have not merged within larger galaxies. Therefore, unveiling their underlying\nstructure could provide important clues about process of dwarf galaxy formation that are\nnow observed at high red-shifts. Local Group galaxies offer the only opportunity of studying\ntheir evolution in great detail through the observation of their resolved stellar populations,\nwhich are fossil records of the star formation history (SFH).\nDSph companions of the Milky Way were historically considered as old systems\ninhabited by globular cluster-like, population II stars (Baade 1963). However, later works\nrevealed traces of intermediate-age stars, such as carbon stars (Aaronson & Mould 1980;\nMould et al. 1982; Frogel et al. 1982; Azzopardi, Lequeux & Westerlund 1986) and bright\nAGB stars (Elston & Silva 1992; Freedman 1992; Lee, Freedman & Madore 1993; Davidge\n1994; but see also Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado & Aparicio 1997). More recent studies, based on the\nanalysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) using synthetic CMDs, have shown that\ndSph are objects with complex and varied SFHs (Mighell 1997; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado, Gallart,\n& Aparicio 1999; Gallart et al. 1999a; Hern\u00e1ndez, Gilmore & Valls-Gabaud 2000; Aparicio,\nCarrera & Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado 2001) and the idea that no two dSphs could be identified to\nhave similar SFHs has become popular.\nAs part of a bigger project devoted to the study of the Ursa Minor dSph galaxy (see\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 2001, 2002), we present in this paper the results on the SFH of this\ngalaxy. Our data sample the galaxy out to 40\u2032 from its center, which is of the order of its\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntidal radius (see Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995; Kleyna et al. 1998; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al.\n2001). Ursa Minor is the second closest dwarf spheroidal galaxy satellite of the Milky Way\n(d = 69 Kpc) and was discovered in the Palomar survey by Wilson (1955). Previous works\nshow an old system similar, in age and abundance, to the ancient metal-poor Galactic\nglobular cluster M92 (Olszewski & Aaronson 1985; Mighell & Burke 1999) and owning a\nwell populated, predominantly blue horizontal-branch (HB) (see e.g. Cudworth, Olszewski\n& Schommer 1986; Kleyna et al. 1998). Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado & Aparicio (1998) pointed\nout the possibility that a marginal intermediate-age stellar population could exist in the\ngalaxy, associated to the blue-plume present in its CMD. Olszewski & Aaronson (1985) and\nMighell & Burke (1999) derived distance moduli of (m \u2212 M)0 = 19.0 \u00b1 0.1 and 19.18 \u00b1 0.12\nrespectively, from a sliding fit to the M92 ridge line. As for the metallicity, it has been\nrecently estimated by Shetrone, C\u00f4t\u00e9, & Sargent (2001), from spectroscopic measurements\nof giant stars, to be [F e/H] = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.11.\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. (2001) have shown evidences that Ursa Minor is in a process\nof tidal disruption. This motivates the spatially extended study of the SFH that we present\nhere. Before us, Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2000) (see also Valls-Gabaud, Hern\u00e1ndez, & Gilmore\n2000) have obtained the SFH for the very central part of Ursa Minor using deep, but small\nfield (\u223c 2.\u2032 5 \u00d7 2.\u2032 5) HST data. They find a stellar population mainly composed of stars older\nthan 10 Gyr.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, the observations and photometric reduction\nare presented. In \u00a73, the CMD of Ursa Minor is discussed, followed by the estimation of the\ndistance and metallicity. The rest of the paper is mainly devoted to the derivation of the\nSFH and the discussion of possible evolution scenarios for Ursa Minor, to which \u00a74, 5 and 6\nare devoted. Finally, the main results of the paper are summarized in \u00a77.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nThe observations of Ursa Minor were carried out in B, V , R and I Johnson-Cousins\nfilters with the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory\nin La Palma and, with the 0.8 m, IAC-80 telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife. In\nthe INT we used the WFC installed at the prime focus, that holds four 2048 \u00d7 4096 pixels\nEEV chips. The scale is 0.33\u2032\u2032/pix, which provides a total field of about 35\u2032 \u00d7 35\u2032 . Three\nfields were observed in B and R filters encompassing a region of about 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 , with a\ntotal covered area of about 0.75 deg2 . Table 1 provides a summary of the observations.\nFigure 1 shows the observed fields. The field containing the center of the galaxy (field\nA) was also observed in V and I. These data will be used to estimate the distance and\nmetallicity (see \u00a73). Observations with the IAC-80 telescope were done to obtain the\nstandard transformations for these bands. A Thomson 1024 \u00d7 1024 chip was used with a\nscale of 0.43\u2032\u2032 /pix, covering a total area of nearly 7.5\u2032 \u00d7 7.5\u2032 .\n\nEDITOR: PLACE TABLE 1 HERE.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 1 HERE.\n\nThe images were processed in the usual way. Bias and flat-field corrections were done\nwith IRAF. DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR (Stetson 1994) were used to obtain the photometry\nof the resolved stars. Transformation into the standard photometric system requires several\nobservations of standard star fields in such a way that standards are measured in all four\nchips of the WFC. In practice, we observed three fields from Landolt (1992) in the four\nchips and used them to calculate relative photometric transformations from each chip to the\ncentral one (chip 4). Then, a larger number of standard star fields were measured in chip 4\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nduring the observing run to calculate both nightly atmospheric extinctions and the general\ntransformation into the standard Johnson\u2013Cousins system. In total, 170 measurements\nof 38 standards were made during the observing run of May 1998. Summarizing, the\ntransformations from each chip to chip 4 are:\n\n(b4 \u2212 b1 ) = 0.329 + 0.02(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.005,\n\n(1)\n\n(r4 \u2212 r1 ) = 0.837 \u2212 0.307(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.010,\n\n(2)\n\n(b4 \u2212 b2 ) = 0.443 \u2212 0.006(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.007,\n\n(3)\n\n(r4 \u2212 r2 ) = 0.833 \u2212 0.268(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.008,\n\n(4)\n\n(b4 \u2212 b3 ) = 0.367 + 0.021(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.008,\n\n(5)\n\n(r4 \u2212 r3 ) = 0.739 \u2212 0.233(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.008,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere sub-indices refer to chips, lower-case letters stand for instrumental magnitudes,\nand capital letters for Johnson-Cousins magnitudes. The \u03c3 values correspond to the fit\ndispersion at the barycenter of point distribution; hence they put lower limits to the\nzero-point errors.\nTransformations from chip 4 instrumental magnitudes measured at the top of the\natmosphere into Johnson-Cousins magnitudes are given by:\n\n(B \u2212 b4 ) = 24.553 \u2212 0.061(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.009,\n\n(7)\n\n(R \u2212 r4 ) = 24.393 + 0.257(B \u2212 R);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.010,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere, as before, lower-case letters refer to extinction-free, instrumental magnitudes and\ncapital letters to Johnson\u2013Cousins magnitudes.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe central field (field A in Fig. 1) of Ursa Minor was also observed with the INT\nin V and I in June 1999. This run was not photometric, for which the IAC-80 telescope\nwas used in May 2001 to obtain the photometrical calibration. Fifteen standards from\nLandolt (1992) and several secondary standards defined in the central region of Ursa Minor\n(covered by chip 4 in the INT observations) were observed to this aim with the IAC-80.\nThe resulting transformation equations for the IAC-80 were:\n\n(V \u2212 vIAC80 ) = 21.110 + 0.055(V \u2212 I);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.009\n\n(9)\n\n(I \u2212 iIAC80 ) = 21.064 + 0.076(V \u2212 I);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.006\n\n(10)\n\nwhile the final transformation for the INT observations (chip 4) resulted:\n\n(V \u2212 v4 ) = 24.13 + 0.04(V \u2212 I);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.02,\n\n(11)\n\n(I \u2212 i4 ) = 24.21 + 0.02(V \u2212 I);\n\n\u03c3 = 0.02,\n\n(12)\n\nAs formerly, lower-case letters refer to instrumental magnitudes and capital letters to\nJohnson\u2013Cousins magnitudes.\nFinally, dispersions of the extinctions for each night are about \u03c3 = 0.01 for each filter.\nAperture corrections were obtained using a set of \u223c 200 isolated, bright stars in the Ursa\nMinor frames, dispersions being of the order of \u03c3 = 0.01. Putting all the errors together,\nthe total zero-point error of our photometry can be estimated to be about \u03c3 = 0.02 for all\nbands.\nIn addition to these errors, ALLSTAR provides, for each star, with the dispersion, \u03c3,\nof the PSF fitting. Generally, these residuals do not reproduce the external errors of the\nphotometry (see Aparicio, & Gallart 1995 and Gallart, Aparicio, & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1996), but they\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nare an indication of the internal accuracy of the photometry. Figure 2 shows these residuals\nas a function of magnitude for each star. For the final photometric list we selected stars\nwith \u03c3 < 0.25.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 2 HERE.\n\nArtificial-star tests have been performed in the usual way (Stetson & Harris 1988; see\nalso Aparicio & Gallart 1995) to obtain completeness factors as a function of magnitude. In\nshort, 13 000 artificial stars were added to the B and R images of Ursa Minor. The central\nchip (chip 4) of central field was used. These stars were distributed in a grid covering\nthe whole image. To avoid overcrowding effects, they were separated about 8.\u2032\u2032 5 from each\nother. Colors and magnitudes chosen for artificial stars were obtained from the synthetic\nCMD (computed as described in Aparicio & Gallart 1995) of an old stellar population with\nsimilar metallicity as Ursa Minor. The resulting completeness factors are shown in Figure\n3. Completeness picks at \u2032\u2032 V \u2032\u2032 \u2243 23.5. But about 5% to 10% of stars are lost at any brighter\nmagnitude. These stars are those happening to lie close to very bright, saturated stars.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 3 HERE.\n\n3.\n\nThe color\u2013magnitude diagram\n\nFigure 4 shows the [(B \u2212 R),\"V \"] CMD of the inner (a \u2264 18\u2032) and outer (18\u2032 < a \u2264 40\u2032 )\nregions of Ursa Minor (\"V \" is defined as \"V \" = (B + R)/2). It must be noted that stars\nassociated to Ursa Minor exist at galactocentric distances larger than 40\u2032 . We restrict our\nplot to stars within this distance to limit foreground and background contamination (see\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 2001 for more details, including CMDs for outermost regions).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nFigure 5 shows a map of the resolved stars with the ellipses limiting the inner and outer\nregions over-plotted. The galaxy center, the ellipses ellipticity (1 \u2212 b/a = 0.44) and the\nposition angle (53\u25e6 ) have been chosen after Irwin & Hatzidimitriou (1995).\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 4 HERE.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 5 HERE.\nThe two CMDs shown in Fig. 4 are qualitatively similar. The most noticeably features\nare the faint, main turn-off at \u2032\u2032 V \u2032\u2032 \u2243 23, (B \u2212 R) \u2243 0.8; the blue-plume extending above it\nand reaching \"V \u2032\u2032 \u2243 21.2; a well populated, globular cluster-like, narrow red giant branch\n(RGB), and a predominantly blue HB, including several stars in the RR-Lyr instability\nstrip. All this suggest an old, low metallicity stellar population and a small metallicity\ndispersion. But the blue-plume requires more attention because it could be made of\nblue-stragglers (BS) but it could also be the trace of an intermediate-age population. It will\nbe discussed in \u00a75.\nFigure 6 shows the [V \u2212 I,V ] and [V \u2212 I,I] CMDs of stars in the central chip of field\nA. Although shallower and less populated than the [(B \u2212 R),\"V \"] CMD, they are better\nsuited for the estimation of distance and metallicity and will be used for this purpose in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 6 HERE.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe distance\n\nThe distance to Ursa Minor can be calculated from the HB magnitude at the color\nof the RR Lyrae variables. A relation between [F e/H] and MV of RR Lyrae must be\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nassumed to this purpose. However, Demarque et al. (2000) have shown that such relation\nis not universal and depends on the HB morphology. To overcome this problem, we have\ncompared Ursa Minor HB with that of several globular clusters with similar metallicity and\nHB morphology as the galaxy. The distance to Ursa Minor can then be obtained from the\ndifference in magnitude between cluster and galaxy HBs and the cluster distances.\nFor this purpose, we firstly need an estimate of Ursa Minor metallicity and of its HB V\nmagnitude. The metallicity has been estimated using the color of the RGB and the Carretta\n& Gratton (1997; CG from here on) and Zinn & West (1984; ZW from here on) scales (see\n\u00a73.2). The first one, [F e/H] = \u22121.75, will be adopted here, since the metallicities of the\nglobular clusters used for comparison are given in the CG scale.\nThe Ursa Minor HB V magnitude must be a reddening free value, which we will denote\nUMi\nVHB,0\n, obtained approximately for the center of the RR-Lyr instability strip, i.e., at about\n\n(V \u2212 I) = 0.4. The HB, \u2032\u2032 V \u2032\u2032 magnitudes must be firstly transformed into usual V Johnson\nmagnitudes. This has been done from the same Padua stellar evolution models (Bertelli\net al. 1994) used in \u00a74. The average difference for the interval 0.2 \u2264 (B \u2212 R) \u2264 0.6 is\nV \u2212\u2032\u2032 V \u2032\u2032 = \u22120.031 \u00b1 0.002. Then, an empirically defined fiducial HB taken from Rosenberg\nUMi\net al. (1999) has been fitted to the Ursa Minor HB. It produces VHB\n= 19.84 \u00b1 0.07.\n\nFurthermore, using the IR dust maps by Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998), a reddening\nof E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.034 is obtained for Ursa Minor. Assuming the relations by Cardelli,\nClayton, & Mathis (1989), this corresponds to an extinction AV = 0.104, from which\nUMi\nVHB,0\n= 19.74 \u00b1 0.07 results.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE TABLE 2 HERE.\n\nThe clusters selected for the HB comparison are listed in Table 2. They have been\ntaken from the IAC-Padua Catalogue of Galactic Globular Clusters (CGGC) (Rosenberg et\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nal. (2000a,b). Column 1 gives the cluster name. Column 2 lists the metallicity in the CG\nscale. The reddening-free distance moduli and HB magnitudes are given in columns 3 and\n4. These values are estimated from main-sequence fitting to Hipparcos subdwarfs (Reid\n1999 and references therein). Although clusters with similar metallicity as Ursa Minor have\nbeen chosen, small differences are still present. To avoid the effects of these differences,\nthe globular cluster HB magnitudes have been transformed to those corresponding to the\ngc\ngc\ngalaxy metallicity using VHB,0,[Fe/H]\n= VHB,0\n+ 0.18([F e/H]U M i \u2212 [F e/H]gc ). The resulting\n\nmagnitudes are given in column 5. Column 6 lists the reddening-free magnitude differences\ngc\nUMi\n. Finally, column 7 gives\nbetween Ursa Minor and cluster HBs: \u2206VHB,0 = VHB,0\n\u2212 VHB,0[Fe/H]\n\nthe distance moduli obtained for Ursa Minor as (m \u2212 M)UMi\n= (m \u2212 M)gc\n0 + \u2206HB,0 .\n0\nThe average of values listed in table 2, column 7 is (m\u2212M)0 = 19.4\u00b10.1, corresponding\nto d = 76 \u00b1 4 Kpc. This value is larger than the value (m \u2212 M)0 = 19.24 \u00b1 0.24 given\nby Nemec et al. (1988) using RR Lyrae periods. Comparing Ursa Minor and M92 fiducial\nsequences, Miguell & Burke (1999) and Olzewski & Aaronson (1985) derived distance\nmoduli of (m \u2212 M)0 = 19.18 \u00b1 0.12 and (m \u2212 M)0 = 19.0 \u00b1 0.1, respectively, also smaller\nthan our result.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe metallicity\n\nThe metallicity of Ursa Minor has been measured spectroscopically by Shetrone et\nal. (2001), who provided a mean value of [F e/H] = \u22121.90 \u00b1 0.11. Previously Olzewski\n& Aaronson (1985) photometrically estimated it to be about [F e/H] = \u22122.2, assuming\nthat Ursa Minor has the same metallicity and age as M92. Here, we will provide a new\nphotometric estimate, based on the color of the RGB. This is a frequently used estimator\nbecause photometrically observing and measuring the RGB is a relatively simple task.\nHowever, it is clear that this method can not compete with spectroscopic determinations\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nand recently, Gallart et al. (2001) have shown that these RGB-estimates can be wrong by\nfar. In any case, the metallicity we will derive will, at least, be useful for comparison with\nresults for other galaxies existing in the literature obtained with the same method.\nTo estimate the metallicity, we have used the relations provided by Saviane et al.\n(2000), based on the position of the RGB of several globular clusters of the IAC-Padua\nCGGC (Rosenberg et al. 2000a,b). We will use the calibration based in the (V \u2212 I)I=\u22123\nparameter; i.e., the (V \u2212 I) color index of the RGB at MI = \u22123. From figure 6 we\nestimate (V \u2212 I)I=\u22123 = 1.17 \u00b1 0.03. The resulting metallicity is [F e/H] = \u22121.75 \u00b1 0.20\nif the CG metallicity scale is used, or [F e/H] = \u22122.01 \u00b1 0.14 if the ZW metallicity scale\nis used. Considering both values, we adopt [F e/H] = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.2, which agrees with the\nspectroscopic value.\nThe color of the RGB can be also used to test whether galactocentric metallicity\ngradients exist in Ursa Minor, under the reasonable assumption that age gradients, if any,\nhave negligible effects on the RGB color. To this purpose, the galaxy has been divided in\nseveral concentric elliptical annuli and the [(B \u2212 R),R] CMDs have been plotted for them.\nThe BR plane is used now because of the larger spatial coverage made in the observations\nwith these filters. Hyperbolic polynomial fits to points in the interval \u22121.5 \u2264 R \u2264 \u22123.2 were\nused to obtain a fiducial RGB for each CMD. The (B \u2212 R) at MR = \u22122.5 ((B \u2212 R)R=\u22122.5 )\nhas then been used as an estimator of the metallicity (Aparicio et al. 2001). It was\nmeasured for each fit and the results are plotted in Figure 7. The error bars show the\ninternal dispersions of points about the polynomial fits. Inspection of this figure reveals\nthat no metallicity gradient can be deduced to exist in Ursa Minor.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 7 HERE.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.\n\nThe Star Formation History\n\nThe SFH of a galaxy can be derived in detail from a deep CMD through comparison\nwith synthetic CMDs (Aparicio 2001). To obtain the SFH of Ursa Minor, we have used\nhere the partial model method, introduced by Aparicio, Gallart, & Bertelli (1997). We have\nclosely followed the prescriptions and criteria used by Aparicio et al. (2001), where this\nmethod was applied to derive the SFH of the Draco dSph. Details on the computation of\nsynthetic CMDs and on the SFH computation method itself can be found in Gallart (1999)\nas well as in Aparicio et al. (1997), as well as in Aparicio (2001) where different methods\nare reviewed.\nThe SFH can be considered a function of several variables (time, stellar mass, etc). A\ntypical approach is assuming it composed by the star formation rate (SFR) function, \u03c8(t)\nand the chemical enrichment law (CEL), Z(t). But the initial mass function (IMF), \u03c6(m)\nand a function accounting for the fraction and mass distribution of binary stars, \u03b2(f, q)\nare also relevant. The most powerful methods now in use are able to solve for \u03c8(t) and\nZ(t) simultaneously and treat \u03c6(m) and \u03b2(f, q) as inputs (see Aparicio 2001 and references\ntherein). In our case, to simplify and having Ursa Minor low metallicity and low metallicity\ndispersion, we have fixed Z(t) and have solved for \u03c8(t) alone. We have adopted the Kroupa,\nTout, & Gilmore (1993) IMF and have neglected the contribution of binary stars.\nThe metallicity given in \u00a73.2, [F e/H] = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.11 (Shetrone et al. 2001), corresponds\nto Z = (2.5 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 . We have adopted a constant metallicity law with this value,\nbut allowing some dispersion, to compute the synthetic stars. According to it, synthetic\nstars have metallicities randomly distributed in the interval 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u2264 Z \u2264 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\nindependently of age. This produces a RGB compatible in color and wideness with Ursa\nMinor's.\nThe only remaining function to complete the SFH of Ursa Minor is the SFR, \u03c8(t).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIt has been solved using the aforementioned partial model method. To apply it, a single\nsynthetic CMD is computed, embracing the full possible age interval (e.g. from 15 Gyr to 0\nGyr). This is divided in several partial models, each containing a stellar population with\nages in a narrow interval. The Padua stellar evolution library (Bertelli et al. 1994) is used\nto this purpose. The basic idea is that any SFR can be simulated as a linear combination\nof partial models.\nThe solution for the SFR must have associated to it a CMD compatible with the\nobserved one. To find such solution, a number of boxes are defined in the CMDs (observed\nand partial models) and the number of stars are counted inside them. The boxes are defined\nin such a way they sample stellar evolutionary phases providing information about different\nages. Let us call Njo the number of stars in box j in the observed CMD and Njim the number\nof stars in box j of partial model i (the partial model covering the i-th age interval). Using\nthis, the distribution of stars in boxes of an arbitrary SFR can be obtained from a linear\ncombination of the Njim , by\nNjm = k\n\nX\n\n\u03b1i Njim .\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b1i \u03c8p \u2206i (t),\n\n(14)\n\ni\n\nThe corresponding SFR can be written as\n\u03c8(t) = k\n\nX\ni\n\nwhere \u03b1i are the linear combination coefficients, k is a scaling constant, and \u2206i (t) = 1 if t\nis inside the interval corresponding to partial model i, and \u2206i (t) = 0 otherwise. Finally, the\n\u03c8(t) having the best compatibility with the data can be obtained by a \u03c72 fitting of Njm to\nNjo , the \u03b1i coefficients being the free parameters.\nIn practice, several choices of partial model distributions have been tried. However,\nchoices involving time resolutions for old stars of the order of 1 Gyr are fluctuating in\na similar way as shown by Olsen (1999), indicating that data do not contain enough\ninformation for such small time sampling. On the other hand, the SFR at intermediate\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nages is so low (if any) that only an average estimate makes sense. In summary, after several\ntrials, the adopted solution is based on a three partial model decomposition corresponding\nto the age intervals 2-10 Gyr, 10-13 Gyr and 13-15 Gyr. The lower limit (2 Gyr) is the age\nof an isochrone having the turn-off point at \u2032\u2032 V \u2032\u2032 \u223c 1.5, corresponding to the upper point of\nthe Ursa Minor blue plume.\nMoreover,11 boxes have been defined in the CMD, as shown in Fig. 8, to characterize\nthe distribution of stars. Box 1 samples the old MS population. Boxes 2 to 5 sample the\nBP population. In this analysis we will consider two possibilities in turn, namely that\nall the BP stars are genuine MS stars (hence of intermediate-age) and that all them are\nBS (hence old stars). We will discuss more about this in \u00a75. Box 6 to 8 cover the HB,\nwhile box 9 samples the region corresponding to intermediate mass, core He-burning stars.\nHere, we will assume that age is the only relevant second parameter to determine the HB\nmorphology. However, it must be kept in mind that the nature of the second parameter is\nnot fully confirmed and that the blue-ward extension of the HB depends on stellar evolution\nparameters that are not well controlled. This could affect the morphology of the SFR for\nthe interval 10-15 Gyr, although the effects on the SFR integral for that period would be\nvery limited.\nBox 10 samples the RGB, populated by old and intermediate-age stars born in fact\nin the full, 2\u201315 Gyr interval considered here. For this reason, it gives no information on\nage resolution, but it provides a strong constraint to normalize the full SFR: independently\nof the age distribution, the integrated SFR for the old and intermediate-age stars must\nbe compatible with it. Beside a few AGBs in the same age interval as the RGBs, box 10\nincludes a number of foreground stars. This number is estimated from box 11 and simply\nsubtracted from the counts in box 10.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 8 HERE.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nThe solution for the SFR is found in a global way, considering the number of stars in all\nboxes. In practice, it is not reasonable to look for the best solution (the linear coefficients\nbest reproducing the distribution of stars in the boxes of the observational CMD), but\nto search all the solutions providing a stellar distribution compatible with the observed\none within some interval. The criterion used here is to adopt as good solutions all those\nproducing chi2\u03bd (the reduced \u03c72 ) within \u03c72\u03bd,best + 1.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 9 HERE.\n\nThe large spatial coverage of our data offers the opportunity of comparing the stellar\npopulation in different regions of the galaxy. To do so, we have computed \u03c8(t) in the inner\n(a \u2264 18\u2032 ) and in the outer (18\u2032 < a \u2264 40\u2032 ) regions defined in \u00a73. These values approximately\ncorrespond to the core and tidal radii (e.g. Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995 find rc = 15.\u2032 8,\nrt = 50.\u2032 6 and Kleyna et al. 1998 obtain rt = 34\u2032 ). The results are shown in Fig. 9. Error\nbars represent the dispersion of the accepted solutions.\nAs in the case of the Draco dSph (Aparicio et al. 2001), the solutions are very similar\nin both regions. However, a marginally significant difference could exist in the fraction of\nstars in the 10 \u2212 13 Gyr interval relative to the 13 \u2212 15 Gyr one, in the sense that the former\ncould be relatively more frequent in the outer region of the galaxy. Since the difference is\nat the error bar level we do not further discuss on it.\nOn the other hand, the solution is largely dominated by very old stars. Some 90% of\nthe stars were formed in an initial, main burst lasting from 15 to 13 Gyr ago and at least\n95% of them were formed before 10 Gyr ago. After that, two possibilities arise. If BP stars\nare normal MS stars, then star formation has gone on at a low rate until recent epochs.\nAlternatively, if BP stars are BS, the star formation has been zero or negligible after 10\nGyr ago. For the reasons discussed below (\u00a75) we adopt the second possibility as the most\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nreliable, which makes Ursa Minor the only Milky Way satellite lacking an intermediate age\nstellar population.\nThe obtained SFR has been used to calculate the total mass in stars and stellar\nremnants (M\u22c6 ) within 18\u2032 and within 40\u2032 . Both values are quoted in Table 3 and the second\nis used to calculate the dark matter fraction, \u03ba.\nThe SFR has been also computed by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2000) (see also Valls-Gabaud et\nal. 2000) for the central region of Ursa Minor using HST data. They obtained a solution\nqualitatively very similar to ours: a major star formation event at an early epoch forming\nall or almost all the stars in the galaxy. However, Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2000) find a maximum\nvalue of 6 \u00d7 10\u22124M\u2299 yr\u22121 at about 14 Gyr and 0 for ages < 10 Gyr while Valls-Gabaud et\nal. (2000), 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , also at \u223c 14 Gyr. These authors calibrate their SFR scale by\nnormalization to account for the total luminosity of Ursa Minor. To compare with them we\nhave to sum the solutions for our inner and outer regions. We obtain a maximum SFR of\n2.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the period 15-13 Gyr, quite similar to the Valls-Gabaud et al. (2000)\nvalue. It is important to stress the compatibility of both solutions, which is more noticeable\nconsidering the different approaches used by these authors and us.\n\n5.\n\nOn the nature of blue stars\n\nTo derive the SFH of Ursa Minor, we have considered in \u00a74 two possibilities about\nthe nature of BP stars, namely that they are normal, intermediate-age, MS stars or BS.\nAlthough it is probably impossible to conclusively ascertain what is the right possibility, a\nfew tests can be done to check what of them is the most reliable. We will discuss in turn\nthe following points, that should cast light on the problem: (i) the amount of stars in the\nRC region of the CMD; (ii) the relative number of BP stars; (iii) their spatial distribution,\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nand (iv) the availability of gas in Ursa Minor.\n\n5.1.\n\nStars in the RC region\n\nIf BP stars would be genuine, intermediate-age, MS stars, they should have a\ncounterpart in the red-clump region of the CMD, sampled by box 9 (Figure 8). However,\nthis criterion is not sensitive enough: only 2-3 stars of this kind are expected to be found in\nthis box, while some 20 to 22 old, AGB stars evolving upwards from the HB are expected to\nlie in the same box. This must be added to the fact that some foreground and background\ncontamination is expected to affect this box, making the star counts in it more uncertain.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe relative number of blue stars\n\nThe number of BS stars relative to a reference population, namely the HB stars, is\nused in the study of the frequency and distribution of BS in globular clusters and field\nstars. We have computed this number for Ursa Minor. Only the inner 18\u2032 have been used\nto limit the effects of background and foreground contamination. The resulting number of\nHB\nBS relative to HB stars is FBS\n= 1.8. This can be compared with the results obtained for\n\nglobular clusters by Piotto et al. (2002) and for Milky Way halo field, blue, metal-poor stars\nHB\n(Preston & Sneden 2000). The former obtain values in the range 0.1 \u2264 FBS\n\u2264 1.0 for most\n\nglobular clusters in their sample, larger values corresponding to less concentrated clusters.\nHB\nThe only two exceptions have FBS\nbetween 2 and 3. Preston & Sneden (2000) obtain\nHB\nFBS\n= 4.4. This scenario points to the BS possibly originating in close binary stars, that\n\nwould be more efficiently destroyed in high density globular clusters. This would account\nHB\nfor the higher values of FBS\nin lower density environments. Indeed, the value found here\n\nfor Ursa Minor, which is intermediate between those of globular clusters and that of the\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nMilky Way halo field, would be compatible with this scenario and would agree with the BP\nstars in Ursa Minor being BS stars.\n\n5.3.\n\nThe spatial distribution of blue stars\n\nA further test of the nature of the BP stars is based on their radial distribution. The\ngas coming from old, dying stars would have a radial distribution similar to that of these\nstars. But the fact that a critical density of gas is required to form new stars implies that\nthese should preferentially form in the inner part of the galaxy (see, for example, the cases\nof Phoenix and NGC 185 in Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 1999a, b, respectively). Figure 10\nHB\nshows that the distribution of FBS\nas a function of galactocentric distance in Ursa Minor is\n\nflat, indicating that the BP population is strongly related to the old stellar population and\nthat it is very likely formed by BS stars.\n\nEDITOR: PLACE FIGURE 10 HERE.\n\n5.4.\n\nGas and intermediate-age stars in Ursa Minor\n\nProducing an intermediate-age population implies a mechanism to generate and\nconserve gas. Deep observations have failed to detect gas in Ursa Minor (Young 1999, 2000),\neven for large distances from the center of the galaxy (Blitz & Robishaw 2000). However,\nthe gas could come, at a low rate, from early generation, dying stars. This could eventually\nallow small, short and recursive star formation bursts that, smoothed and averaged, would\naccount for a low rate star formation at intermediate ages. The rate at which this material\nis returned to the ISM can be estimated from the integration of the SFR through\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nR(t) =\n\nZ\n\nmu\n\nml\n\n[m \u2212 p(m)]\u03c6(m)\u03c8[t \u2212 \u03c4 (m)]dm\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ml and mu are lower and upper integration limits for the stellar mass, p(m) is the\nmass of the stellar remnant of a star of initial mass m, and \u03c4 (m) is the life time of a star\nof mass m. Note that we are using time increasing toward the past, with the present-day\nvalue being 0. We assume that all the gas returned to the interstellar medium from SNe\nexplosions escapes the galaxy and we will estimate only the gas coming from stellar winds\nof intermediate and low mass stars in the inner Ursa Minor region, where density is larger.\nFrom a linear fit to Vassiliadis & Wood's (1993) results for stars of metallicity Z = 0.004\n(the lowest they compute) in the mass interval from 0.89 M\u2299 to 5.0 M\u2299 , we obtain\np(m) = 0.489 + 0.093 \u00d7 mi , where mi is the initial stellar mass. Using the SFR obtained\nin \u00a74 for the inner region (a \u2264 18\u2032 ) and for the case in which BP stars are assumed to be\nintermediate-age MS stars; the Kroupa et al. 's (1993) IMF; ml = 0.89M\u2299 , and mu = 5.0,\nwe obtain in average R\u0304(t) = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for 2 Gyr< t < 13 Gyr (inner 18\u2032 ). This\nvalue is five times the averaged SFR obtained in \u00a74 for that period, \u03c8\u030413\u22122 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nHowever, in a dwarf galaxy such as Ursa Minor, gas is expected to be repeatedly\nremoved through SNe explosions. Van den Bergh & Tammann (1991) estimated that,\nfor a galaxy of the luminosity of Ursa Minor, the SNIa rate is one per 107 years. In\nthis interval Ursa Minor (inner 18\u2032 ) would accumulate some 130 M\u2299 in all of gas from\nintermediate (if any) and low mass dying stars. Under these conditions, it seems really\ndifficult to accumulate gas enough in any limited region of the galaxy to allow stars to form\nat intermediate ages.\nTo see this more clearly it should be enough considering that, if gas from intermediate\nand low mass dying stars would distribute across the galaxy as the stars do, the central gas\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\ndensity would reach a value of some 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 pc\u22123 after 10 Gyr if not removed by SNe\nexplosions. This value corresponds to a particle density of 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm\u22123 , much smaller\nthan values about 1000 cm\u22123 , which are typical lower thresholds for star forming regions\n(Shu, Adams, & Lizano 1987).\n\n6.\n\nThe SFH scenario in Ursa Minor\n\nIn summary, the tests discussed in \u00a75 support the idea that BP stars in the Ursa Minor\nCMD are BS and that not a significant intermediate-age stellar population is present in the\ngalaxy. Consequently, the overall SFH for Ursa Minor can be sketched in the following way.\nIn a first phase, lasting from about 15 to 13 Gyr ago with a further extension up to 10 Gyr\nago, most or all the stars now populating the galaxy were formed. Unused gas would likely\nhave been ejected or swept in the subsequent SNe explosions. In a second phase, starting\nupon the end of the first one, dying stars injected gas into the interstellar medium. Some\nof it could have been used to form new stars but, most likely, SNIa explosions would have\navoided the accumulation of enough gas at any moment of this phase, preventing any star\nformation at intermediate ages. In such a case, blue-plume stars in Ursa Minor would be\nBS. The best solution for the SFH is shown by the full line in Figure 9. Alternatively, the\nmaximum SFR compatible with the BP stars being genuine, intermediate-age, MS stars is\nshown by a dotted line in the same figure.\nIt must be mentioned that, in our analysis of Draco (Aparicio et al. 2001), we assumed\nthat the BP was formed by genuine MS stars. The 2-3 Gyr old burst found in the SFH of\nDraco depends on this assumption and, for this reason, as quoted in Aparicio et al. (2001),\nthe value found for of the SFR in that burst is to be considered an upper limit. But the\nburst also relies on the RC and subgiant populations present in Draco's CMD, for which\nthe existence of an intermediate-age stellar population in Draco should be considered real.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nSummarizing, although apparently similar at first glance, Ursa Minor and Draco differ in\ntwo important properties: their dynamical structures, with Ursa Minor showing a tidal\ntail (Martnez-Delgado et al. 2001) but Draco lacking it (Aparicio et al. 2001) and Draco\nshowing an intermediate-age stellar population which is not present in Ursa Minor.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs a part of our project devoted to the study of the Ursa Minor dSph, the SFH of the\ngalaxy is presented in this paper. The analysis uses wide field photometry, encompassing\nabout 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 (total covered area about 0.75 deg2 ) and the synthetic CMD technique for the\nderivation of the SFH.\nThe resulting SFH shows that Ursa Minor hosts a predominantly old stellar population.\nVery likely, virtually all the stars were formed before 10 Gyr ago, and 90% of them\nwere formed before 13 Gyr ago. This picture shows Ursa Minor as the Milky Way dSph\nsatellite most resembling the original hypothesis of Baade, namely that dSphs were pure\nold, globular cluster-like systems. Nevertheless, Ursa Minor CMD shows a well populated\nblue-plume above the main, old, MS turn-off. If these stars were genuine, MS stars, Ursa\nMinor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to \u223c 2 Gyr ago.\nHowever, (i) the relative number of BP to HB stars; (ii) the spatial distribution of BP stars,\nand (iii) the gas availability play against such possibility and strongly favors the BP stars\nbeing a BS population. In this context, Ursa Minor would remain the only dSph, Milky\nWay satellite hosting a pure old stellar population.\nThe SFH study has been done for two regions of the galaxy, namely the one within\nthe core radius and the one between this and the tidal radius. No significant differences\nhave been found between the stellar populations in both regions except for the fact that the\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nfraction of stars found in the 10 \u2212 13 Gyr interval is marginally larger.\nBesides the SFH analysis, the distance of Ursa Minor has been also derived from\ncomparison of the galaxy HB magnitude with those of some globular clusters. These were\nchosen to have the same metallicity and HB morphology than the galaxy. We obtained a\ndistance of d = 76 \u00b1 4 Kpc. The metallicity was also estimated from the RGB color to be\n[F e/H] = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.25, in agreement with the spectroscopic value by Shetrone et al. (2001).\nNo metallicity gradient is detected along the galaxy.\n\nWe are indebted to the anonymous referee of this paper for several comments and, in\nparticular, for suggesting a further discussion of the blue-stars problem.
