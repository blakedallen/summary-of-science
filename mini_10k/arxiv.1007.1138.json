Within the DDT paradigm, the transition density\nsets the amount of expansion during the deflagration phase of the explosion and therefore the amount of nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium (NSE) material produced. We employ a theoretical framework for a well-controlled statistical study of two-dimensional simulations of thermonuclear supernovae with randomized initial conditions\nthat can, with a particular choice of transition density, produce a similar average and range of 56 Ni masses\nto those inferred from observations. Within this framework, we utilize a more realistic \"simmered\" white\ndwarf progenitor model with a flame model and energetics scheme to calculate the amount of 56 Ni and NSE\nmaterial synthesized for a suite of simulated explosions in which the transition density is varied in the range\n1\u20133\u00d7107 g cm\u22123 . We find a quadratic dependence of the NSE yield on the log of the transition density, which\nis determined by the competition between plume rise and stellar expansion. By considering the effect of metallicity on the transition density, we find the NSE yield decreases by 0.055 \u00b1 0.004 M\u2299 for a 1 Z\u2299 increase\nin metallicity evaluated about solar metallicity. For the same change in metallicity, this result translates to a\n0.067 \u00b1 0.004 M\u2299 decrease in the 56 Ni yield, slightly stronger than that due to the variation in electron fraction\nfrom the initial composition. Observations testing the dependence of the yield on metallicity remain somewhat\nambiguous, but the dependence we find is comparable to that inferred from some studies.\nSubject headings: hydrodynamics - nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances - supernovae: general\n- white dwarfs\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nType Ia supernovae are bright stellar explosions that are\ncharacterized by strong P Cygni features in Si and by a lack of\nhydrogen in their spectra (see Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000;\nFilippenko 1997 and references therein). Observations of type\nIa supernovae (serving as distance indicators (Phillips 1993;\nRiess et al. 1996; Albrecht et al. 2006)) are at present the\nmost powerful and best proved technique for studying dark\nenergy (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Kolb et al.\n2006; Hicken et al. 2009; Lampeitl et al. 2010), and, accordingly, there are many observational campaigns underway\nstriving to gather information about the systematics of these\nevents and to better measure the expansion history of the Universe (see Kirshner 2009 and references therein).\nThe most widely accepted model for these events is the\n\"single-degenerate\" scenario, which is the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf composed principally of 12 C and\n16\nO that has accreted mass from a companion (for a review\nof explosion models, see Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000; Livio\n2000; R\u00f6pke 2006). The peak brightness of the supernova is\nset by the radioactive decay of 56 Ni produced in the explosion\nto 56 Co and then to 56 Fe. The empirical \"brighter is broader\"\n1 Department of Physics & Astronomy, The State University of New York\n- Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY\n2 New York Center for Computational Sciences, The State University of\nNew York - Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY\n3 Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Alabama,\nTuscaloosa, AL\n4 Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL\n5 Department of Physics & Astronomy, Michigan State University, East\nLansing, MI\n6 The Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics\n7 School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University,\nTempe, AZ\n\nrelation between the peak brightness of the light curve and\nthe decay time from its maximum is understood to follow\nfrom the fact that both the luminosity and opacity are set by\nthe mass of 56 Ni synthesized in the explosion (Arnett 1982;\nPinto & Eastman 2000; Kasen & Woosley 2007). Because of\nthe dependence of the light curve on the amount of radioactive 56 Ni synthesized during an explosion and the ability to\ninfer the 56 Ni yield from observations (Mazzali et al. 2007),\nresearch into modeling thermonuclear supernovae typically\nfocuses on the production and distribution of 56 Ni as well as\nother nuclides (such as 28 Si) as the measure with which to\ncompare models to observations.\nOne-dimensional simulations of the single-degenerate case\nshowed that the most successful scenario is an initial deflagration (subsonic reaction front), born in the core of the\nwhite dwarf (WD) which at some point becomes a (supersonic) detonation, i.e. a deflagration-detonation transition (DDT, Khokhlov 1991; H\u00f6flich & Khokhlov 1996). A\ndelayed detonation naturally accounts for the high-velocity\nCa features (Kasen & Plewa 2005) and the chemical stratification of the ejecta. While these 1D models are able to reproduce observed features of the light curve and spectra, much\nof the physics is missing from these models. The presence of\nfluid instabilities during the deflagration warranted the development of multidimensional models, allowing a physicallymotivated calculation of the velocity of the burning front and\nthus removing a free parameter. By relaxing the symmetry\nconstraints on the model, buoyancy instabilities are naturally\ncaptured leading to a strong dependence on the initial conditions of the deflagration that often result in too little expansion of the star by the time DDT conditions used in previous 1D studies are met (Niemeyer et al. 1996; Calder et al.\n2003, 2004; Livne et al. 2005). Multidimensional models\n\n\f2\nmay reach the expected amount of expansion prior to the\nDDT with the choice of particular ignition conditions and\nthus retain the desirable features from one-dimensional models (Gamezo et al. 2004; Plewa et al. 2004; R\u00f6pke et al. 2006;\nJordan et al. 2008).\nDue to the strong dependence on ignition conditions, multidimensional simulations of the DDT model are able to produce a wide range peak luminosities (via the production of\na range of 56 Ni yields) consistent with a common explosion\nmode suggested from observations (Mazzali et al. 2007). Differences in the mass of synthesized 56 Ni can follow from\nproperties such as metallicity and central density of the progenitor and/or differences in the details of the explosion\nmechanism such as the density at which the transition from\ndeflagration to detonation occurs. Timmes et al. (2003) found\nthat metallicity should affect the 56 Ni yield based on approximate lepton number conservation. The metallicity sets\nthe fractional amount of material in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) that is radioactive 56 Ni. Bravo et al. (2010)\nfound a stronger dependence on metallicity due to a significant amount of 56 Ni that is synthesized during incomplete\nSi-burning.\nObservational results to date are consistent with a shallow dependence of 56 Ni mass on metallicity but are unable to rule out a trend entirely (Gallagher et al. 2005, 2008;\nNeill et al. 2009; Howell et al. 2009). Determining the metallicity dependence is challenging not only because the effect\nappears to be small, but also due to the difficulty in measuring accurate metallicities for the parent stellar population and\nproblems with strong systematic effects associated with the\nmass-metallicity relationship within galaxies (Gallagher et al.\n2008). This effect is also difficult to decouple from the apparently stronger effect of the age of the parent stellar population on the mean brightness of SNe Ia (Gallagher et al. 2008;\nHowell et al. 2009; Krueger et al. 2010). Howell et al. (2009)\nnote that the scatter in brightness of this observed relation is\nunlikely to be explained by the effect of metallicity. In general, the source of scatter can be explained by the development of fluid instabilities during the deflagration phase that\ncontribute to differing rates of expansion between instances\nof supernovae. However, by considering the effect of metallicity on the DDT density, scatter in the metallicity relation\nmay be enhanced beyond its intrinsic value inferred from fluid\ninstabilities.\nTownsley et al. (2009) investigated the direct effect of\nmetallicity via initial neutron excess and found it to have a\nnegligible influence on the amount of material synthesized to\nNSE. However, the neutron excess sets the amount of material\nin NSE that favors stable Fe-group elements over radioactive\n56\nNi. Therefore, the initial metallicity directly influences the\nyield of 56 Ni. In this work, we expand that study to include\nthe potential indirect effect of metallicity in the form of the\n22\nNe mass fraction (X22 ) through its influence on the density\nat which the DDT takes place. To this end, we explore the effect of varying the transition density, a proxy for varying the\nmicrophysics that determine the conditions for a DDT. The\nconditions under which a DDT occurs are still a subject of\ndebate. Niemeyer & Woosley (1997), Niemeyer & Kerstein\n(1997), and Khokhlov et al. (1997) proposed that a necessary\ncondition is the transition to a distributed burning regime,\nin which turbulence disrupts the reaction zone of the flame.\nMore recent numerical studies (Pan et al. 2008; Woosley et al.\n2009; Schmidt et al. 2010) that describe the conditions for a\nDDT include dependencies on the turbulent cascade and the\n\ngrowth of a critical mass of fuel with sufficiently strong turbulence. For this study, we assume the DDT density to be\nthe density at which thermonuclear burning is expected to enter the distributed regime. This choice links the explosion\noutcome to the dynamical evolution of the progenitor density\nstructure during the deflagration phase. By analyzing the effect of transition density on the NSE yield, we can later analyze how the details of the microphysics affect the DDT density. For the purposes of this study, we will consider only the\neffect of X22 on the DDT density. In reality, the 12 C mass\nfraction will also be important in determining the DDT density, but we choose to leave the exploration of the effect of 12 C\nto future work. Many other possible systematic effects exist\nthat are outlined in Townsley et al. (2009), such as the central\nignition density (Krueger et al. 2010), which are all held fixed\nin this study. The interdependence of all of these effects will\nbe considered in the construction of the full theoretical picture\nin a future study.\nWe describe the details of our model in \u00a72 and \u00a73, and the\nproperties of our statistical sample in \u00a74. We present our findings on the dependence of transition density on NSE yield\nin \u00a75.1. In \u00a75.2 and \u00a75.3, we assume a dependence of the\ntransition density on 22 Ne content and construct the functional\ndependence of the 56 Ni yield on metallicity through the 22 Ne\ncontent. In \u00a76, we discuss our conclusions and future work.\n2. PARAMETERIZED REALISTIC WHITE DWARF PROGENITOR\n\nIn order to include relevant processes in explosion models, we first estimate the compositional profile of the progenitor white dwarf just prior to the birth of the flame. We begin by estimating the compositional profile resulting from the\nevolution of the post-main-sequence star that later becomes\na white dwarf. Recall that the initial metallicity of the star\nis, by mass, almost entirely in the form of CNO. As a result\nof the C-N-O cycle, these all end up in helium layers as 14 N,\nthe target of the slowest proton-capture in the cycle. Subsequent reactions during helium burning convert 14 N into 22 Ne;\ntherefore, X22 is proportional to the initial metallicity of the\nstar (Timmes et al. 2003). The composition of the inner portion of the star (\u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.4 M\u2299 ) is set during core helium\nburning resulting in a reduced carbon mass fraction with respect to that of the outer layers, which is set by shell burning\non the asymptotic giant branch (see Straniero et al. 2003, and\nreferences therein).\nAt some point after the white dwarf has formed, it begins\nto accrete material from its companion. As the mass of the\naccreting white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit, the core temperature and density increase such that carbon begins to fuse. The energy released by carbon burning\ndrives convection in the core. The convective carbon burning (\"simmering\") phase lasts approximately 1000 years before the central temperature is high enough to spark a thermonuclear flame (Woosley et al. 2004). During the simmering phase, carbon is consumed from the convective core. Concurrently, though, the convective zone grows with increasing\ncentral temperature, pulling in relatively carbon-rich material\nfrom the outer layer. Thus, the net effect is to increase the carbon abundance in the convective region. We show the growth\nof the convective zone in Figure 1, where dashed lines show\nthe compositional profile prior to the simmering phase and\nthe corresponding solid lines show the compositional profile\nat the start of our simulations of the explosion.\nFor our WD models, we consider a parameterized 3-species\ncompositional structure consisting of 12 C, 16 O, and 22 Ne,\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\nTABLE 1\nC OMPOSITION OF THE CORE AND OUTER LAYER OF THE PROGENITOR\nWHITE DWARF.\n\n3\n\nTABLE 2\nF LAME SPEEDS AND WIDTHS CHANGING 22 Ne TO CARBON - SIMMERING\nASHES HOLDING Ye = 0.498636 FIXED AND USING X12 = 0.4.

Since\n22\nNe is the only element in our parameterization that has more\nneutrons than protons, the neutron excess from simmering is\naccounted for by a parameterized 22 Ne mass fraction\n\u2032\nX22\n= X22 + \u2206X22 (\u2206Ye ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere X22 is proportional to the initial metallicity coming\nfrom helium burning (Timmes et al. 2003) and \u2206X22 (\u2206Ye )\nrepresents the effective enhancement of 22 Ne in the core following from the change in electron fraction during convective\ncarbon burning. The electron fraction (Ye ) is related to X22 by\n1\n10\nX22 + (1 \u2212 X22)\n(2)\n22\n2\nsuch that a change in X22 constitutes a change in Ye . The prime\n\u2032\non X22\nin Equation (1) indicates inclusion of effects of neutronization during carbon burning and this convention applies\nto expressions below. We choose the composition of the WD\nat the end of the simmering phase to consist of X12 = 0.4 and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nX22\n= 0.03 in the core and X12 = 0.5 and X22\n= 0.02 in the outer\n\u2032\nlayer. Note that X22 = X22 in the outer layer because neutronization due to carbon burning only occurs in the convective\ncore.\nFor comparison, a compositional profile can be estimated\nfor the WD prior to the onset of carbon burning. For simplicity, consider the production of one neutron for every 6 12 C\nburned (i.e., dYe /dY12 \u2248 1/6, where Y12 is the molar abundance of 12 C) (Chamulak et al. 2008; Piro & Bildsten 2008).\nFor \u2206X22 = 0.01 in our progenitor model, this constitutes\nburning 0.04 M\u2299 of carbon during simmering. Assuming that\nprior to simmering, the core mass is \u2248 0.3 M\u2299 (Straniero et al.\n2003) and the outer layer consists of X12 = 0.5 material, we\ncan account for all 12 C and conserve the total mass of the WD\nto estimate X12 \u2248 0.2 in the carbon-reduced core of the WD\nprior to simmering as shown in Figure 1.\nTable 1 shows the composition of the progenitor white\ndwarf before and after the simmering phase using the parameterized 22 Ne mass fraction as well as the core mass. Note\nthat throughout this study, we choose to neglect any variation\nof the amount of neutronization during simmering due to the\ninitial Z. Accordingly, \u2206X22 (\u2206Ye ) is treated as a constant and,\n\u2032\ntherefore, dX22\n= dX22 and derivatives involving the true 22 Ne\nmass fraction proportional to metallicity, X22 , are equivalent\nto derivatives involving the parameterized 22 Ne mass fraction,\n\u2032\nX22\n.\nBecause we consider the enhancement of the laminar flame\nspeed by 22 Ne (Chamulak et al. 2007), we need to consider\nthe effects of our parametrization of the 22 Ne content with\ncare. In actuality, the neutronization during carbon simmering\nproduces 13 C, 23 Na, and 20 Ne and not 22 Ne (Chamulak et al.\n2008). A priori, this difference could alter the nuclear burning rates and hence the laminar flame speed and width.

For high densities\n(& 2.5 \u00d7 108 g cm\u22123 ) in which the flame speed is not dominated by the buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the\ndifference is . 5%; therefore, our parametrization of the neutronization via X22 accurately captures the corresponding enhancement of the laminar flame speed in this regime.\nWhile the central temperature and central density of the\nprogenitor just prior to the birth of the flame are primarily set\nby the accretion history of the white dwarf, which varies and\nis largely unknown, we choose a fiducial central density of\n\u03c1c = 2.2 \u00d7 109 g cm\u22123 and central temperature of Tc = 7 \u00d7 108\nK. We construct isentropic profiles of density and temperature\nin the (convective) core and isothermal profiles in the (thermally conductive) outer layer while maintaining hydrostatic\nequilibrium. We choose a fiducial isothermal temperature of\nthe outer layer to be Tiso = 108 K. The total mass of the WD\nprogenitor model is 1.37 M\u2299 .\nDue to the difference in composition between the core and\nouter layer, requiring a neutral buoyant condition at this interface no longer reduces to a continuous temperature as it does\nfor a compositionally uniform white dwarf (Piro & Chang\n2008). In reality, we might expect some convective overshoot\nand mixing between the core and the outer layer, but because\nthe physics of convective overshoot are complex and not well\nunderstood, the width of the transition region is unknown.\nFor simplicity, we assume no mixing region.

The compositional profile of the progenitor prior to the simmering phase is also shown\n(dashed lines).\n\nWe use a customized version of the FLASH Eulerian compressible adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code (Fryxell et al.\n2000; Calder et al. 2002). Modifications to the code include a\nnuclear burning model, composition-dependent laminar flame\nspeeds, particular mesh refinement criteria, and instructions\nfor determining the conditions for a DDT (for details, see\nCalder et al. 2007; Townsley et al. 2007, 2009). In particular, the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) capability of the\ncode was utilized to achieve particular resolutions for burning fronts (4 km) and the initial hydrostatic star (16 km) for\nwhich the solution has converged (Townsley et al. 2009).\nThe burning model is used for both subsonic (deflagration) and supersonic (detonation) burning fronts. The laminar flame width for densities and compositions characteristic of a massive C-O WD is unresolved on the scale of our\ngrid (4 km, Chamulak et al. 2007); therefore, we use an artificially thickened flame represented by the advection-reactiondiffusion equation (Khokhlov 1995; Vladimirova et al. 2006)\nto which our nuclear energetics scheme is coupled. Appropriate measures have been taken to ensure this coupling is\nacoustically quiet and stable such that the buoyant instability of the burning front is accurately captured (Townsley et al.\n2007). The shock-capturing capabilities of FLASH naturally\nhandle the propagation of detonation fronts given an accurate\nnuclear energetics scheme (Meakin et al. 2009). We note that\nthe only common components between our code and that of\nPlewa (2007) are those publicly available as components of\nFLASH, which excludes all components treating the nuclear\nburning; differences are discussed in Townsley et al. (2007).\nIn this section we discuss an improvement to our burning\nmodel and an improvement to the method by which a transition from deflagration to detonation is made. The changes\nto the burning model reflect recent work to better match\nsteady-state detonation structures that are partially resolved\non the grid. This is important for obtaining accurate particle tracks for post-processing nucleosynthetic yields. Additionally, changes to the DDT method were necessary to ensure consistency between individual simulations using different DDT densities and/or different initial configurations of the\nflame.\n3.1. Improved Burning Model\n\nFor the calculations presented here we utilize the latest revision of a parameterized three-stage model for the\nnuclear burning (Calder et al. 2007; Townsley et al. 2007;\nMeakin et al. 2009; Seitenzahl et al. 2009b; Townsley et al.\n\n2009). The details of this latest version will be published\nseparately (Townsley et al., in prep.) along with extensive comparisons to nuclear network calculations of steadystate detonations, but we summarize the major changes here.\nThis work represents the first time a burning model which\ncorrectly reproduces the nuclear statistical quasi-equilibrium\n(NSQE, Khokhlov 1989) to NSE transition time scales and\nlength scales during incomplete silicon burning has ever been\nused in a multi-dimensional SN Ia calculation, as validated\nby comparison to steady-state detonation structures calculated out to the pathological point with the ZND model (see\ne.g. Fickett & Davis 1979). Accurate reproduction of this\nlow-density burning regime is essential because a significant portion of the 56 Ni is produced in incomplete burning (Bravo et al. 2010) so that the overall 56 Ni yield is determined by the details of how this low-density cutoff of 56 Ni\nproduction occurs.\nObtaining a satisfactory reproduction of ZND detonation\nstructures involved two main changes to the 3-stage burning model. First, we found that the progress variable representing the NSQE to NSE transition, \u03c6qn , which also gives\nthe mass fraction of Fe-group (NSE) material, did not match\nthe time and space structure of this transition in steady state\ndetonations calculated with a full nuclear network. The kinetics for this stage, first proposed by Khokhlov (1991) and\nadopted in Calder et al. (2007), are given by the simple form\nd\u03c6qn /dt = (1 \u2212 \u03c6qn )/\u03c4NSE where \u03c4NSE is a calibrated timescale\nthat depends mainly on temperature. We have found, however that a far more appropriate match to steady-state detonations at densities important for incomplete silicon burning, \u03c1 . 107 g cm\u22123 , is obtained with the alternative form\nd\u03c6qn /dt = (1 \u2212 \u03c6qn )2 /\u03c4NSE . This necessitates a recalibration of\n\u03c4NSE , since it now plays a different role, but it is still sufficient\nfor it to depend only on temperature. Although this change in\nderivative significantly improves the match between the parameterized burning and the ZND structure at the densities\nof interest, it is still not exact at all densities. It is therefore\nunclear if this form is indicative of some underlying physical process, and whether or not it is specific to detonations.\nThere are several relaxation processes proceeding simultaneously, so that it is non-trivial to quantify separate contributions. This will be investigated in more detail in future work\non post-processing nucleosynthesis.\nThe second major burning model change was motivated by\nneeding to match the thermodynamic, i.e. T , \u03c1, profiles at\ndensities at which the portion of the detonation structure representing the NSQE to NSE transition is resolved on the grid.\nOur previous treatment released all of the nuclear binding energy change to the NSE state by the end of the second stage,\nleaving the third stage NSQE to NSE transition energetically\ninert. This lack of an energy release on the NSE timescale\nleads to an incorrect progression of the density fall-off behind the shock front in the detonation. The abbreviated energy release leads to an under-prediction of the temperature\nimmediately behind the unresolved earlier burning stages in\na propagating detonation. A very good match of thermodynamic profiles to the full-network steady state detonation was\nobtained by tying the completion of the energy release to \u03c6qn ,\nso that energy release occurs in three distinct stages. Note that\nthe previous change involving the kinetics used for \u03c6qn is also\nan important contributor to the realism of the thermodynamic\nprofiles obtained.\nFinally, although detailed nucleosynthesis based on postprocessing tracer particle histories will be published in fu-\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\nture work (Townsley et al., in prep.), we have performed\ntwo important tests for the burning model used in this work.\nThe composition profiles obtained from post-processed histories for hydrodynamic simulations of steady-state detonations match the steady-state structure calculated via the ZND\nmethod with a large network with remarkable accuracy. Additionally, a preliminary version of the post-processing under\ndevelopment has been applied to the calculations presented\nhere, and we have found good agreement between \u03c6qn and\nthe the fraction of material in the form of Fe-group nuclides\nfound from post-processing on both an overall basis and in\nejection velocity bins. Overall, the burning model changes\nled to a modest but significant (around 0.2M\u2299 ) increase in the\noverall Fe-group yields for the same explosion. The yields\nfound here are not quite this much higher than similar cases\nfrom Townsley et al. (2009) because the progenitors used here\nhave a lower central carbon fraction.\n3.2. Improved Detonation Ignition Conditions\n\nIn order to study the systematic effects associated with\nchanging the DDT density, we need to minimize any systematics in our method of starting a detonation. Previously,\nin Townsley et al. (2009), we visualized the simulation data\nfrom the deflagration phase and plotted a density contour at\nthe DDT density. When the flame reached \u2248 64 km away\nfrom the contour, we picked a computational cell half-way\nbetween the flame front and the DDT density contour to place\na detonation ignition point with a radius of 8 km. The placement and size of the detonation point was chosen to be as\nclose to the flame front as possible while still allowing the\ndetonation point to develop into a self-sustained, stable detonation front. If the detonation point is placed too close to\nthe flame front, then the flame will interact with the detonation point before it develops into a self-sustained detonation.\nComparisons of simulations from identical initial conditions\nwith 8 and 12 km ignition radii finds the NSE yield differs\nby . 0.5% throughout the evolution. This results indicates\nthat the total yield is insensitive to the choice of detonation\nignition radius for radii less than the characteristic size of a\nrising plume (as can be seen in Figure 2). We adopt 12 km for\nthe detonation ignition radius in our study as it produces more\nrobust detonations at low density.\nTo ensure that we do not introduce unintended systematic\neffects in this study, we improve our method of detonation ignition point placement over the previous \"by hand\" method\nby precisely defining the criteria for a DDT that is used in\nan algorithm. Parameters in this algorithm are chosen to be\nconsistent with Townsley et al. (2009). Once the flame front\nreaches the specified DDT density in a simulation, a detonation is ignited 32 km radially outward away from the flame\nfront. Here the reaction-diffusion (RD) front is defined by the\nvariable representing progress of the subsonic burning wave,\n\u03c6RD , with the leading edge defined as the region between the\nvalues 0.001 and 0.01 of this variable. During the deflagration\nphase of a simulation, \u03c6RD is equivalent to the carbon-burning\nreaction progress variable, \u03c6 f a . At the leading edge of the RD\nfront, very little carbon has burned and the local density is\napproximately equal to the unburned density. This provides\na definition of the DDT density that is much more precise\nand accurate. We chose these criteria that ignite the detonation ahead of the RD front to avoid any issues with the detonation ignition point overlapping with the artificially thickened flame. If we were to choose criteria that would initiate a\ndetonation inside a thickened flame, the detonation structure\n\n5\n\nwould need to be altered in some way to be consistent with\nthe artificial nature of that region.\nOur detonation ignition conditions also restrict detonation\nignition points to be at least 200 km away from each other.\nThis choice ensures that each rising plume starts 2\u20133 detonations, which is consistent with Townsley et al. (2009). In\nthe case that multiple points within 200 km meet the detonation ignition conditions, the point furthest from the center\nof the star is preferred ensuring the ignition of detonations\non plume \"tops\". In reality, the location of the spontaneous\ndetonation points is not well known and is the subject of active research. For instance, R\u00f6pke et al. (2007) argue that a\nspontaneous detonation is triggered by the extreme turbulence\nfound in the roiling fuel underneath the plume caps. Under the\nassumption that the DDT occurs when the flame reaches the\nlow density for distributed burning, we place ignition points\non the tops of the rising plumes. Future studies, however,\nwill explore other physically motivated detonation methods\nin which the location of the detonation ignition is not necessarily specified relative to a plume, but rather determined by\nthe local turbulence field, composition, density, and temperature (R\u00f6pke et al. 2007; Woosley et al. 2009). Figure 2 shows\nthe placement of first one detonation point, and then another\nmore than 200 km away from the first, both at the specified\nDDT density.\n\nF IG . 2.- Snapshots of realization 2 just after one (left) and then another\n(right) detonation was ignited at the specified transition density of 1.26 \u00d7 107\ng cm\u22123 (green contour). The reaction progress variable representing carbon\nburning is in color. The detonating regions are the rapidly expanding regions\nof completely burned carbon ahead of the plume.\n\nEach detonation ignition point is defined by the profile of\nthe reaction progress variable representing carbon burning,\n\u03c6 f a . Within the detonation ignition radius \u03c6 f a = 1, and, because we are igniting in fuel, \u03c6 f a = 0 outside this region. The\nsubsequent energy release from this change in \u03c6 f a drives a\nshock strong enough to ignite the surrounding unburned material. This top-hat profile is a simple approach to igniting\na detonation and has some drawbacks. At densities below\n\u2248 107 g cm\u22123 , this detonation ignition method does not produce a sufficiently strong shock to burn the fuel. The improvements to our DDT method place the detonation point radially outward from the specified DDT density; therefore, the\ndensity within the detonation point is actually somewhat less\nthan that specified by the DDT density. This differs from the\nmethod described in Townsley et al. (2009) in that the detonation point was placed at a density that was somewhat higher\nthan the specified DDT density. Igniting a detonation specifying a DDT density below 107.1 g cm\u22123 is impossible using\na top-hat profile because the detonation ignition point is actually placed \u2248 107 g cm\u22123 . In future works, we will explore the\nuse of a gradient in \u03c6 f a motivated by Seitenzahl et al. (2009a)\nto describe the detonation ignition point profile which should\nresult in the formation of stronger shocks that will burn the\n\n\f6\nsurrounding low-density fuel.\n4. PROPERTIES OF STATISTICAL SAMPLE AND METHOD\n\nTo study the systematic effect of transition density on the\nNi yield synthesized during a simulated explosion, we utilize the statistical framework developed in Townsley et al.\n(2009). In order to compare results between this study and\nTownsley et al. (2009), we use the same sample population\nusing the same initial seed. The initial seed defines the starting\npoint to a stream of random numbers used to characterize our\nsample population of thermonuclear supernovae as described\nin Townsley et al. (2009). In that study, we found that the\nsample dispersion in the estimated NSE yield does not asymptote until more than 10 realizations. Accordingly, our sample\nis made up of 30 realizations.\nDuring the early part of the deflagration phase (\u2248 0.1 s), the\nflame is most affected by convective motion in the core of the\nWD. Because the velocity field in the core and the number of\nignition points are largely uncertain, we choose to characterize the initial flame surface using spherical harmonics, each\nwith a random coefficient picked sequentially from the initial\nseed. Each realization is defined with a unique perturbation\non the initial spherically symmetric flame surface using\nlmax\nX\nr (\u03b8) = r0 + a0\nAl Yl0 (\u03b8) ,\n(3)\n56\n\nl=lmin\n\nwhere r0 is the radius of flame surface, a0 is the amplitude of\nthe perturbations, Al is a randomly-chosen coefficient corresponding to the spherical harmonic Yl0 , and lmin and lmax set\nthe range of spherical modes used to perturb the flame surface. This method serves to initialize Rayleigh-Taylor unstable plumes of random relative strengths, which we would expect from various distributions of ignition points and varying\nstrengths of the convective velocity field found in the real population of progenitors. In this study, r0 = 150 km, a0 = 30 km,\nlmin = 12, and lmax = 16. The choices of these parameters\nare motivated by the resolution of our study and the desire\nto obtain reasonable 56 Ni yields inferred from observations.\nThese choices are discussed in further detail in Townsley et al.\n(2009).\nWe choose to analyze the dependence on transition density by choosing 5 different transition densities equidistant\nin log space at L\u03c1DDT = {7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5} in cgs units,\nwhere L\u03c1DDT = log10 \u03c1DDT . The range of DDT densities chosen for this study are motivated both by previous work and\ncomputational challenges. Below L\u03c1DDT = 7.1, a more realistic detonation structure is needed to successfully launch\na detonation wave as described in the previous section and\nin Seitenzahl et al. (2009a). While recent studies have suggested a wider range of DDT densities are possible (Pan et al.\n2008; Schmidt et al. 2010), we suggest that trends resulting\nfrom varying the DDT density are captured with a maximum\nL\u03c1DDT = 7.5.\nA simulation is performed for each of the 30 realizations\nin our sample at each DDT density for a total of 150 simulations. We choose not to explore DDT densities below this\nspecified range for computational reasons. Because of the approximate power-law density profile of the WD, DDT densities were chosen in log space because these densities correspond to relatively evenly spaced radial coordinates of the\nWD. The amount of 56 Ni synthesized in the explosion principally depends on the amount of expansion during the deflagration phase. Therefore, spatially separated detonation ignition conditions will allow the amount of expansion to vary\n\na non-negligible amount and we can more easily analyze the\ndependence of the yield on DDT density.\n18\n16\n14\n\nlog10 \u03c1DDT = 6.83\nlog10 \u03c1DDT = 7.10\nlog10 \u03c1DDT = 7.30\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n56\n\nM( Ni) (M\u2299)\n\nF IG . 3.- The distributions of the 56 Ni yield for three different transition\ndensities \u03c17 = 0.76 (solid), 1.26 (dashed), and 2.00 (dotted). Note that the\nvariance increases with decreasing transition density. The distribution corresponding to \u03c17 = 0.76 is calculated by extrapolating the dependence of DDT\ndensity as described in \u00a75.1 such that the mean M(56 Ni) \u2243 0.60 M\u2299 consistent with observations.\n\nWe find that extrapolating our results to a DDT density\nof L\u03c1DDT = 6.83 yields an estimated average 56 Ni yield of\n\u2243 0.60 M\u2299 with a standard deviation of 0.21 M\u2299 (from\nthe fits described below and listed in Table 4) that is consistent with observations (Howell et al. 2009). Because the\nactual DDT density is unknown and the subject of ongoing research (Pan et al. 2008; Aspden et al. 2008, 2010;\nWoosley et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2010), we are free to\nchoose this value of the DDT density as the fiducial DDT\ndensity, L\u03c1DDT,0 = 6.83. This choice is relevant for analysis and comparison to other works as discussed in \u00a75. The\ndistribution of 56 Ni material synthesized during the explosion is shown in Figure 3 for different transition densities at\nL\u03c1DDT = 6.83, 7.10, and 7.30.\nR\nThe NSE mass, MNSE , is defined as \u03c6qn \u03c1dV integrated\nover the star. We determine the NSE yield by running the\nsimulation until MNSE is no longer increasing as a function of\nsimulation time. This condition is defined as\nM\u2299\ndMNSE\n< 0.01\n.\n(4)\ndt\ns\nBecause we estimate the 56 Ni yield as a fraction of the NSE\nyield, we consider the 56 Ni yield to have plateaued when the\nNSE yield has plateaued. Considering additional 56 Ni from\nincomplete Si-burning in NSQE material and the efficient\ncapture of excess neutrons onto Fe-group elements changes\nthe final 56 Ni estimate by . 1%. Therefore, to good approximation, the 56 Ni yield is a fraction of the NSE yield. Figure 4\nshows the evolution of the NSE yield as a function of simulation time showing the DDT time and the NSE yield plateau\ntime for each DDT density for realization 2. Discernible from\nthis figure, there is a clear dependence of the NSE yield on\ntransition density.\n5. RESULTS\n\nWithin the DDT paradigm for thermonuclear supernovae,\nthe conditions under which a transition occurs are still not\ncompletely understood (Aspden et al. 2008, 2010). Generally, though, a hypothesized transition occurs when the flame\nenters the distributed burning regime, which occurs when\nthe flame speed equals the turbulent velocity at the scale\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\n1.4\n\n7\n\n1.3\n7.1\n\nMNSE (M\u2299)\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n1.2\nMNSE (M\u2299)\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c1DDT = 10\n7.2\n\u03c1DDT = 10\n7.3\n\u03c1DDT = 10\n7.4\n\u03c1DDT = 10\n7.5\n\u03c1DDT = 10\nDDT\nPlateau\n\n0.6\n\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n\n0.4\n0.8\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.7\n0.5\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nSimulation Time (s)\n\nF IG . 4.- The NSE yields for realization 2 at each transition density used\nin this study. The closed circles indicate the time the flame first reaches the\nDDT density. The open squares show the time the NSE yield has plateaued\nas defined by Equation (4).\n\nof the flame width assuming a Kolmogorov turbulent cascade (Niemeyer & Woosley 1997). Recent work has placed\nmore stringent requirements on the DDT (Pan et al. 2008;\nWoosley et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2010) and fundamental\nquestions concerning deflagration in the limit of disruptive\nturbulence remain (Poludnenko & Oran 2010). Regardless of\nthe actual DDT mechanism, it is likely that the DDT conditions will depend on composition because both the width and\nburning rate of the flame depend on the abundances 12 C and\n22\nNe. For the current study, we assume that a DDT will occur\nat a unique density given a particular composition, regardless\nof the microphysics involved. This assumption is reasonable\ngiven that the characteristics of the flame depend strongly on\ndensity. Using this assumption, we can delay the analysis of\nthe particular microphysics that lead to a specific transition\ndensity and analyze the dependence of the amount of material synthesized to NSE during the explosion on the transition\ndensity. Therefore, we can think of each transition density\nas a proxy for changing the composition that determines the\nconditions for a DDT via the appropriate microphysics.\nAs discussed in detail in Townsley et al. (2009), many systematic effects exist that influence the outcome of a SN. In\nthat study, the direct effect of 22 Ne was explored and found to\nhave a negligible influence on the NSE yield. Therefore, we\ndo not vary the initial 22 Ne mass fraction, but rather study the\neffect of varying the DDT density with the expectation that\nthe NSE yield will be influenced indirectly by 22 Ne and 12 C\nabundances through the DDT density. We focus on the indirect effect of the 22 Ne abundance on the NSE yield, following\nup previous work in Townsley et al. (2009) and neglect the\neffect of varying the carbon abundance. Additionally, we neglect effects due to the central ignition density, compositional\nand thermodynamic WD structure, and the total WD mass.\nThe effects due to these variables will be studied in turn in future works with the goal of addressing interdependencies once\nindividual effects are better understood.\n5.1. Dependence on Transition Density\n\nThe evolution of the amount\nof material above a denR\nsity threshold (M\u03c1>\u03c1thres = \u03c1thres \u03c1dV , where we take \u03c1thres =\n2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 ) principally determines the dependence of the\nNSE yield on DDT density. This is due largely to the linear relationship between the NSE yield and M\u03c17 >2 (t = tDDT ) shown\nin Figure 5, where tDDT is defined as the time the flame first\nreaches the specified DDT density. This definition is consistent with our assumption that DDT conditions are met on the\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\nM [\u03c17>2, t=tDDT] (M\u2299)\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\nF IG . 5.- Mass burned to NSE as compared to the mass above a density\nof 2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 at the first DDT time for each realization in our sample.\nThe different shapes plotted (+, \u00d7, \u2217, \u2737, \u0004) correspond to different transition densities (107.1 , 107.2 , 107.3 , 107.4 , 107.5 ), respectively. The solid line\nshows the linear fit to yields produced with a DDT density of 107.1 g cm\u22123\nmost closely matching the DDT density used in Townsley et al. (2009). The\ndashed line shows a 1:1 correlation between the NSE yield and mass above\n2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 . The lowest two DDT densities are less than the density\nthreshold 2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 and thus show more scatter about the linear relation\ndue to increased dependence on the plume morphology.\n\ntops of rising plumes. As mentioned above, other DDT locations are possible, such as the highly turbulent region underneath plume \"caps\", which would result in a higher DDT density correlated to our present definition via the density structure local to the rising plume. As shown in Figure 4, the deflagration phase burns only a relatively small fraction of the\nwhite dwarf and the majority of material is burned during the\ndetonation. Once a detonation has started, the propagation\nspeed of the burning wave is much greater than the rate of expansion; therefore, the NSE yield is essentially independent\nof the evolution of M\u03c17 >2 for t > tDDT . The number of detonation points and their corresponding distribution in time and\nlocation contributes to the variance of the relation between the\nNSE yield and M\u03c17 >2 . The relation between the NSE yield\nand DDT density via M\u03c17 >2 also depends on the acceleration\nof the RT-unstable plumes not being too great near tDDT . For\na constant plume rise-rate near tDDT , there is a linear relationship between the DDT density and tDDT . This relationship\nallows the evolution of M\u03c17 >2 to translate directly into a dependence of the NSE yield on DDT density. Figure 6 shows\nthe evolution of M\u03c17 >2 and \u03c1min as a function of simulation\ntime for 3 different realizations where \u03c1min is the minimum\ndensity at which the flame is burning material. The evolution of \u03c1min shows the linear relationship between the log of\nthe DDT density and tDDT where the filled circles represent\nthe tDDT times for each of 5 transition densities and the filled\nsquares show the fiducial DDT density. For the times corresponding to the DDT conditions, the evolution of M\u03c17 >2 is\nin a region where the rate of expansion of the star becomes\nsignificant and M\u03c17 >2 begins to drop off relatively quickly.\nWe find, for each individual realization, the NSE yield depends quadratically on transition density. Table 3 lists the\nNSE yields for each realization at each of 5 transition densities equidistant in log-space. Table 4 shows the coefficients\nused to fit the quadratic dependence of NSE yield on transition density for\nMNSE (M\u2299 ) = a (L\u03c1DDT )2 + bL\u03c1DDT + c.\n\n(5)\n\nFigure 7 shows fits to the NSE yield for each realization and\nthe average yields at each transition density.

We also highlight\nthe fiducial DDT density as black squares. These plots emphasize the importance of the rate of expansion of the WD and the plume rise-time as a function of\ndensity in determining the relation between the NSE yield and DDT density. Realization 2 produces NSE yields that are close to the average while realizations\n10 and 18 produce the lowest and highest yields, respectively.\n\nindividual curves showing the dependence of NSE yield on\nDDT density are shown in grey. The average NSE yields at\neach DDT density are shown in red. At a transition density\nof 107.5 g cm\u22123 , notice that the dependence on DDT density\nhas flattened out for almost all realizations and the variance\nof the yields among all realizations is small. This behavior\nis due to the fact that the progenitor white dwarf star has a\nfinite mass of 1.37 M\u2299 . At the highest transition density, the\nexpansion rate of the star is relatively small, and the evolution\nof M\u03c17 >2 is relatively slowly declining as compared to lower\nDDT densities (see Figure 6).\n1.4\n1.3\n\nMNSE (M\u2299)\n\n1.2\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n7.6\n\n7.5\n\n7.4\n\n7.3\nlog10 \u03c1DDT\n\n7.2\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\nF IG . 7.- Quadratic fits (grey lines) to the NSE yields for each realization (blue crosses) and the average NSE yield at each transition density (red\ncircles). The qualitative similarity between this figure and the right panel of\nFigure 6 is due to the near 1:1 correlation between MNSE and M\u03c17 >2 (t = tDDT ).\n\nThe curvature of the NSE yield dependence on DDT density, a, is well correlated with the NSE yield at a given DDT\ndensity. Figure 8 shows this correlation for L\u03c1DDT,0 = 6.83;\nhowever, a correlation exists for all DDT densities as may be\ndiscernible from Figure 7 noting that most black lines representing individual realizations do not cross. The lower the\nNSE yield for a given realization, the stronger the dependence\non transition density. This result is likely due to realizations\nwith lower yields having multiple competing plumes that release more energy allowing the star to expand more rapidly\nleading to a stronger dependence on the transition density.\n\nTABLE 3\nNSE YIELDS IN M\u2299\n\nRel.\n#\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nM\u0304\n\u03c3\n\u03c3M\u0304\n\nFOR EACH REALIZATION AT EACH TRANSITION\nDENSITY, L\u03c1DDT .\n\n7.1\n0.989\n0.970\n0.948\n0.951\n1.027\n1.074\n1.076\n1.110\n0.917\n0.791\n1.092\n1.240\n0.882\n1.070\n1.119\n0.883\n1.026\n1.181\n0.967\n1.005\n1.222\n1.045\n1.001\n0.900\n0.989\n1.092\n1.192\n1.145\n1.063\n1.179\n1.038\n0.110\n0.020\n\n7.2\n1.082\n1.056\n1.043\n1.062\n1.101\n1.138\n1.132\n1.167\n1.022\n0.929\n1.147\n1.258\n0.987\n1.125\n1.176\n0.994\n1.115\n1.223\n1.057\n1.089\n1.248\n1.104\n1.085\n1.012\n1.057\n1.150\n1.222\n1.183\n1.131\n1.225\n1.111\n0.082\n0.015\n\nL\u03c1DDT\n7.3\n1.152\n1.131\n1.119\n1.144\n1.168\n1.185\n1.179\n1.210\n1.105\n1.038\n1.189\n1.273\n1.083\n1.185\n1.218\n1.081\n1.171\n1.249\n1.132\n1.138\n1.268\n1.170\n1.150\n1.091\n1.139\n1.192\n1.251\n1.220\n1.175\n1.249\n1.169\n0.059\n0.011\n\n7.4\n1.207\n1.184\n1.174\n1.197\n1.214\n1.219\n1.215\n1.239\n1.163\n1.113\n1.229\n1.289\n1.145\n1.223\n1.254\n1.142\n1.213\n1.270\n1.185\n1.180\n1.284\n1.216\n1.187\n1.130\n1.193\n1.228\n1.274\n1.253\n1.210\n1.273\n1.210\n0.046\n0.008\n\n7.5\n1.236\n1.215\n1.209\n1.226\n1.242\n1.248\n1.243\n1.260\n1.199\n1.166\n1.255\n1.301\n1.183\n1.250\n1.274\n1.183\n1.241\n1.290\n1.220\n1.218\n1.297\n1.244\n1.223\n1.176\n1.226\n1.254\n1.290\n1.273\n1.235\n1.288\n1.239\n0.036\n0.007\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\n\na (M\u2299 )\n-1.024\n-0.933\n-1.010\n-1.388\n-0.815\n-0.595\n-0.480\n-0.619\n-1.164\n-1.454\n-0.442\n-0.083\n-1.212\n-0.557\n-0.575\n-1.173\n-0.963\n-0.348\n-0.926\n-0.708\n-0.210\n-0.583\n-1.093\n-1.219\n-0.782\n-0.490\n-0.248\n-0.276\n-0.685\n-0.429\n\nb (M\u2299 )\n15.56\n14.24\n15.40\n20.95\n12.43\n9.12\n7.42\n9.41\n17.70\n22.17\n6.87\n1.36\n18.45\n8.58\n8.78\n17.88\n14.58\n5.34\n14.15\n10.86\n3.25\n9.03\n16.47\n18.46\n12.04\n7.56\n3.86\n4.36\n10.42\n6.54\n\nc (M\u2299 )\n-57.9\n-53.1\n-57.5\n-77.8\n-46.2\n-33.7\n-27.4\n-34.5\n-66.1\n-83.3\n-25.4\n-4.3\n-69.0\n-31.8\n-32.2\n-66.9\n-54.0\n-19.2\n-52.8\n-40.4\n-11.3\n-33.6\n-60.9\n-68.7\n-45.1\n-27.9\n-13.7\n-15.9\n-38.4\n-23.6\n\nMNSE (L\u03c1DDT,0 )\n0.637\n0.633\n0.589\n0.515\n0.732\n0.852\n0.876\n0.898\n0.515\n0.279\n0.902\n1.183\n0.456\n0.844\n0.910\n0.470\n0.712\n1.048\n0.628\n0.740\n1.134\n0.798\n0.696\n0.502\n0.671\n0.896\n1.080\n1.006\n0.827\n1.032\n\n-0.2\n\n-1.6\n-90 -80 -70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10\nc (M\u2299)\n\na (M\u2299)\n\n-1.4\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\nF IG . 8.- The correlation between the NSE yield at the fiducial DDT density L\u03c1DDT,0 = 6.83 and the fitting parameter a from Equation (5).

Dominant single plumes tend to allow the star to expand\nless prior to reaching the conditions for a detonation, while\nmultiple competing plumes tend to release more energy during the deflagration phase, allowing more expansion prior to\nreaching the conditions for a DDT. Shown in Figure 10 are\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor unstable plumes for the realizations with\nthe highest and lowest yields a few tenths of seconds into the\ndeflagration. Unfortunately, no strong correlation exists between the properties of the initial flame surface, such as mass\nenclosed, surface to volume ratio, or amount of power in the\nperturbation, for a given realization and the single fitting parameter c. This lack of a correlation implies there is no way\nto tell whether a particular initial condition will seed a single\ndominant plume or multiple competing plumes.\nPhysically, we might expect two competing effects that influence the NSE yield: plume morphology (rise time) and the\nrate of expansion. In our 2D simulations these two effects appear to be correlated as seen in Figure 6. Our results indicate\nthat plumes near the symmetry axis tend to rise faster than\nplumes rising near the equator and we attribute this result to\nthe fact that our simulations are two-dimensional. A plume\nthat develops near the symmetry axis naturally becomes dominant in 2D and determines the DDT time and thus the NSE\nyield. In addition, a plume near the symmetry axis represents\nless volume than a plume of similar size near the equator. This\nindicates that energy is being deposited into a smaller volume\nallowing for a lesser rate of expansion. This explains why the\noverall rate of expansion of the star is correlated to the rise\ntime of the first plume to reach DDT conditions.\nIn order to evaluate the dependence on DDT density without this unphysical correlation, we need to perform 3D simulations. A suite of 3D simulations will likely create a twoparameter family (plume rise and expansion rates) of solutions which describe the yield as a function DDT density. Additionally, we expect 3D plumes to behave similarly to 2D\non-axis plumes implying a faster plume rise time.\n\n\f10\nTABLE 6\nC OEFFICIENTS FOR LOG - LOG FITS TO E QUATION (11).

In order to derive the NSE yield dependence on X22 , we need to expand the derivative of MNSE with\nrespect to X22 which involves only a couple of terms given our\nassumptions\n\u2202MNSE dL\u03c1DDT \u2202MNSE\ndMNSE\n=\n+\n.\ndX22\n\u2202L\u03c1DDT dX22\n\u2202X22\n\n(8)\n\nNSE\nTownsley et al. (2009) showed that \u2202M\n\u2202X22 = 0. In that study,\nthey employed an estimate of the mass burned to NSE by measuring the amount of mass above a density of 2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 .\nThat correlation is confirmed by our current study as shown\nin Figure 5 where we plot the NSE yield of all realizations at\neach transition density. The correlation between NSE yield\nand mass above 2 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 at tDDT for a transition density of 1.26 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 , closest to the transition density\nused for that study, is highlighted. Given our assumptions\nand the result that the NSE yield does not depend directly on\n\u2032\nX22\n(Townsley et al. 2009), the NSE yield only depends di\u2032\nrectly on the DDT density. The affect of X22\non the yield\n\nX22 = 0.02\n0.7942\n-12.735\n-1.3550\n19.17\n\nX22 = 0.06\n0.7745\n-12.121\n-1.3507\n18.88\n\nenters through the DDT density. Therefore, we will construct\n\u2032\nthe functional dependence of L\u03c1DDT on X22\n.\nThe DDT density depends on X22 via the microphysics involved in determining the conditions under which the flame\ntransitions from a deflagration to a detonation, which, as noted\nabove, is incompletely understood. We assume the transition\noccurs at a particular density at which the flame enters the distributed burning regime, but more stringent conditions for the\nDDT include dependences on the turbulent cascade and the\ngrowth of a critical mass of fuel with sufficiently strong turbulence (Pan et al. 2008; Woosley et al. 2009; Schmidt et al.\n2010). The dependence on composition of these models may\nbe explored and applied to the trends with DDT density presented in this study. Under our assumptions, the flame enters\nthe distributed burning regime when the laminar flame width\nbecomes of order the Gibson length (lG ) where\n\u0010 s \u00113\nl\n(9)\nlG = L \u2032 .\nu\nHere, L is the length scale on which the strength of the turbulent velocity (u\u2032 ) is evaluated, and sl is the laminar flame\nspeed (see e.g. Peters 2000). By using the laminar flame\nspeeds and widths which depend on X22 from Chamulak et al.\n(2007), we choose the conditions for a detonation are met\nat X22 = 0.02 at a particular transition density (L\u03c1DDT ) when\nthe Gibson length is equal to the laminar flame width. The\nstrength of the turbulent velocity field is calculated assuming\na Kolmogorov turbulence cascade:\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\n\u03b4l (\u03c1, X22 = 0.02)\n\u2032\nu = sl (\u03c1, X22 = 0.02)\n.\n(10)\nL\nUsing u\u2032 , we solve for the change in transition density,\n\u2206L\u03c1DDT , by changing 22 Ne to X22 = 0.06 and again setting\nthe Gibson length equal to the laminar flame width where L\ncancels out of the equation. This evaluation yields a change\nDDT\nin transition density over a change in X22 , or dL\u03c1\ndX22 .\nWe use log-log fits to the flame speed and flame width\nas a function of density using the table generated by\nChamulak et al. (2007). We use only densities above 108 g\ncm\u22123 for X12 = 0.3 and above 5 \u00d7 108 for X12 = 0.5. Within\nthis parameter space, a power-law dependence of the flame\nspeeds and widths on the log of the density is well-defined\nand the algorithm used to solve the flame characteristics is\nmore stable at higher densities. Our resulting expressions for\nthe density dependence on flame speed, s, and flame width,\n\u03b4l , at the carbon mass fraction used in this study (X12 = 0.4)\nfor X22 = 0.02, 0.06 are given by\nln s = a ln \u03c1 + b\nwith coefficients given in Table 6.\n\n(11)\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\n\nwhere u = 0.4315 and v = \u22126.301. We solve this first-order differential equation and express the DDT density as a function\n\u2032\nof X22\n.\n\u0011\n\u2032\nv \u0010 u(X22\u2032 \u2212X22,0\n\u2032\n)\u22121\ne\nL\u03c1DDT (X22\n)=\nu\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+L\u03c1DDT,0 eu(X22\u2212X22,0) ,\n(13)\n\u2032\nwhere X22,0\nis the parameterized 22 Ne mass fraction chosen to\nbe associated with the fiducial transition density, L\u03c1DDT,0 . For\nall the transition densities considered in this study, the interface between the core composition and the composition of the\nouter layer is at a lower density. Therefore, the relevant 22 Ne\ncontent to consider is that of the core. Plugging in Equation\n(13) into Equation (5), we obtain the functional dependence\n\u2032\nof MNSE on X22\n, such that\n\u0001\u0001\n\u2032\n.\n(14)\nMNSE = MNSE L\u03c1DDT X22\n\nEquation (14) is evaluated and plotted in Figure 11 for the\nfiducial transition density at the 22 Ne mass fraction used in\nthis study,\n\u2032\nL\u03c1DDT (X22,0\n= 0.03) = L\u03c1DDT,0 = 6.83.\n\n(15)\n\nWe propagate the standard deviation of the mean evaluated at\n\u2032\nL\u03c1DDT,0 for a range of X22\n. This is calculated by considering\nthe relation between the standard deviation of the mean of the\nNSE mass and the standard deviation of the mean of the fitting\nparameter, c, given by\n\u0010 \u0002\n\u0001\u00032\n\u0001 \u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c3NSE = \u03b1 L\u03c1DDT X22\n+ 1 \u03c3c , (16)\n+ \u03b4L\u03c1DDT X22\n\nwhere \u03c3NSE is the standard deviation of the mean of the NSE\nmass and \u03c3c is the standard deviation of the mean in the fitting\nparameter c. We evaluate \u03c3c by inverting Equation (16) and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsolving for X22\n= X22,0\n.

A fractional amount of the NSE\nmaterial is radioactive 56 Ni, which powers the supernova light\ncurve. This fraction depends on Ye (and 22 Ne) as described in\nTimmes et al.

Recall that X22\nfrom Equation\n(1) contains a term, \u2206X22 , which is a parameterization of the\nchange in Ye due to neutronization during the carbon simmering phase. However, not all of the neutron excess evaluated\nat the MNSE plateau time comes from 22 Ne or the carbon simmering products. Some change in Ye is due to weak reactions\noccuring during the explosion that are included in our burning\nmodel (Calder et al. 2007; Townsley et al. 2007).\nFirst we consider the amount of non-56Ni NSE material de\u2032\ntermined by X22\nby equating the initial Ye to the Ye of material\nin NSE. Using baryon and lepton conservation for NSE material, we describe the electron fraction by contributions from\n54\nFe, 58 Ni , and 56 Ni,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n28 1\n28\n26 1\nfnon\u221256 +\nfnon\u221256 + (1 \u2212 fnon\u221256 ) ,\nYe =\n54 2\n58 2\n56\n(19)\nwhere fnon\u221256 is the mass fraction of non-56 Ni NSE material.\nFor the following evaluation, we approximate the composition\nto be that of the core because most of the NSE material is\nwithin the core. We write the initial Ye as\n\u0001\n10 \u2032 1\n\u2032\nYe,i = X22\n+ 1 \u2212 X22\n.\n(20)\n22\n2\nWe can then solve for fnon\u221256 by equating (19) and (20) and\nadd a term Xn to represent the additional contribution due to\nneutronization from weak reactions occuring during the explosion\n783 \u2032\nX + Xn.\n(21)\nfnon\u221256 =\n308 22\nThen the 56 Ni fraction of material in NSE is\n783 \u2032\nf56 = 1 \u2212\nX \u2212 Xn .\n(22)\n308 22\nWe note that the rate of weak reactions occuring during the\nexplosion may depend on the initial composition as well. Ac\u2032\ncordingly, Xn may have a dependence on X22\n. We also expect\nXn to vary as a function of the transition density because a\nhigher transition density will have less time for weak reactions to occur.\nWe construct a statistical sample of f56 using the ratio of\nthe 56 Ni and NSE yields produced in the simulations. We\n\n\f12\ncalculate the dependence of Xn on transition density using a\nleast-squares method and the result is shown in Figure 12.\nEvaluating the partial derivative of Xn at the fiducial transition\ndensity, we find a shallow dependence:\n\u2202Xn\n= \u22120.096.\n(23)\n\u2202L\u03c1DDT L\u03c1DDT =L\u03c1DDT,0\n\ndMNSE\n\u2202 f56\ndM56\n= f56\n+ MNSE\n.\n(29)\ndX22\ndX22\n\u2202X22\nWhile we approximate Xn as constant, we choose to evaluate it at L\u03c1DDT,0 using the best fit curve from Figure 12 obtaining Xn = 0.133. Now we can relate the metallicity to 22 Ne\nsince X22 traces metallicity (Timmes et al. 2003).

The standard deviation\nof the sample (outer) and mean (inner) are shown as error bars at each DDT\ndensity. A quadratic best fit line is calculated using the standard deviation\nof the sample. The fiducial DDT density is shown as a black circle where\nXn = 0.133.\n\nWe want to know the dependence of M56 on X22 . Since\nf56 depends on the neutronization from weak reactions during the explosion, we must consider any dependencies of this\n\u2032\nneutronization on DDT density or X22\n. We show that the de\u2032\n\u2032\npendence of f56 on X22\nvia the effect of X22\non the in-situ neutronization is much weaker than the direct dependence due\nto lepton number conservation.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nWe have analyzed the influence of the DDT density on\nthe total 56 Ni synthesized during a thermonuclear supernovae. We determined that the dependence on DDT density\nis quadratic in nature, but this dependence can be described\nby a single parameter. We estimated the dependence of the\nsupernova brightness (56 Ni yield) on metallicity by assuming\na DDT occurs when the flame enters the distributed burning\nregime and extrapolating the laminar flame speeds and widths\ndown to low densities. We find\ndM56\n= \u22120.067 \u00b1 0.004M\u2299,\n(31)\nd(Z/Z\u2299 ) Z=Z\u2299\nwhich is slightly steeper than Timmes et al. (2003) as seen in\nFigure 13. The uncertainty was calculated using the standard\ndeviation of the mean of the fitting parameter c-or equivalently, the standard deviation of the mean of the NSE yield at\n\n\fSN Ia dependence on DDT density\na particular DDT density. The uncertainty in the assumptions\nabout the normalization of the transition density as a function\n\u2032\nof X22\nwas not considered for the purpose of evaluating the\nuncertainty in the derivative. We find the effect of metallicity\non DDT density influences the production of NSE material;\nhowever, the ratio of the 56 Ni yield to the overall NSE yield\ndoes not change as significantly and remains similar to the\nrelation estimated from approximate lepton number conservation. We also find that the scatter in supernova brightness\nincreases with decreasing transition density.\nThe very recent work of Bravo et al. (2010) on metallicity as a source of dispersion in the luminosity-width relationship of bolometric light curves addresses many of the same\nissues as our study and warrants discussion. In particular,\nBravo et al. (2010) derive a metallicity dependence on the\nDDT density similarly to our study. However, the DDT density in their 1D simulations is very different from the DDT\ndensity in ours. The principal difference between the work\ndescribed in this manuscript and that of Bravo et al. (2010)\nfollows from the use of multi-dimensional simulations. While\n3D simulations are required to correctly capture the effects of\nfluid dynamics and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, 2D simulations incorporate these effects and relax the assumption\nof symmetry. Breaking the symmetry and assuming that a\nDDT initiates as a rising plume approaches \u03c1DDT produces\nan expansion history very different from what would be observed in 1D simulations. In fact, using 1D simulations implies that \u03c1DDT plays an unphysical role. The real physical\ndescription of the DDT in a type Ia supernova will depend on\nflame-turbulence interactions that will themselves depend on\nmulti-dimensional effects in the flow. 1D models may be able\nto capture these effects, but such models must be motivated\nby more physical multi-dimensional studies.\nIn addition, our statistical framework with realizations from\nrandomized initial conditions allows calculation of the scatter inherent in the multi-dimensional models. The standard\ndeviations calculated for our models averaged over a set of\nrealizations demonstrate that there can be considerable variation following from the randomized initial conditions. These\nvariations follow from the different amounts of expansion occurring during the deflagration phase that follow from the different rising plume morphologies. In 1D models, even with\nthe progenitor metallicity determining \u03c1DDT , there is a one-toone correspondence between expansion and \u03c1DDT for a given\nprogenitor.\nBravo et al. (2010) explored two scenarios, a linear and a\nnon-linear dependence of the 56 Ni yield on Z, and report excellent agreement between the non-linear scenario and observations reported by Gallagher et al. (2008) with the caveat\nthat they used 1D models to arrive at their conclusion. Without comparing results involving the metallicity dependence\non \u03c1DDT , Bravo et al. (2010) find a stronger dependence of\nthe 56 Ni synthesized from incomplete Si-burning on Z than\n56\nNi coming from NSE material. We find a shallower dependence of the 56 Ni yield on Z than Bravo et al. (2010) in part\ndue to our assumption that 56 Ni is synthesized as a fraction\nof NSE material; however, comparing their stratified models\nto the Timmes et al. (2003) relation results in only a \u223c 20%\ndifference in the dependence of 56 Ni yield on Z. This effect\nis compounded in their \"non-linear\" scenario, but again, we\nmust emphasize that \u03c1DDT plays a completely unphysical role\nin their simulations and the degree to which this effect is actually enhanced is unknown.\nThe light curve width calculations and subsequent popula-\n\n13\n\ntion synthesis performed by Bravo et al. (2010) after finding\na dependence of the 56 Ni yield on metallicity is useful in estimating a metallicity dependence in the hubble residual. For\nthis purpose, we compare the results of the non-linear scenario\nof Bravo et al. (2010) to our study along with the expected dependence due to lepton number conservation (Timmes et al.\n2003) in Figure 13. Bravo et al. (2010) find a \u223c 30% steeper\ndependence of the 56 Ni yield on Z/Z\u2299 evaluated at Z = 1Z\u2299\nthan our result in Equation (31). In addition, they find that\nfor high Z the 56 Ni yield tends to flatten out becoming more\nsimilar to our results. For a particular subrange of metallicites, our results are very similar indicating that by performing the same analysis as Bravo et al. (2010) our results\nshould also agree with the metallicity dependence found by\nGallagher et al. (2008).\nThis similarity depends on the choice of mean 56 Ni yield\nas both Timmes et al. (2003) and Bravo et al. (2010) relations\nare proportional to this quantity. This implies that the steepness of the relations are affected by the choice of mean 56 Ni\nyield. Our results are not sensitive to this choice. Choosing a higher fiducial DDT density of 107 g cm\u22123 that results\nin a higher mean 56 Ni yield of 0.77 M\u2299 increases Equation\n(31) by only 0.005 M\u2299 . We see less dependence on the mean\n56\nNi yield because, although we have a similar dependence\non X22 due to lepton number conservation, the dependence\nof the yield on L\u03c1DDT is stronger at lower fiducial L\u03c1DDT,0 ,\nas shown in previous sections. This effect is not captured in a\nsimple proportionality relation like that quoted by Bravo et al.\n(2010), even if this effect is present in their calculations.\nIt has been discussed whether the source of scatter in peak\nbrightness itself can be attributed to metallicity (Timmes et al.\n2003; Howell et al. 2009; Bravo et al. 2010). We submit that\nmulti-dimensional effects following from fluid instabilities\nduring the deflagration phase leading to varying amounts of\nexpansion provide scatter consistent with observations. The\ninfluence of metallicity on the DDT density affects the duration of the deflagration which will secondarily influence the\nmagnitude of the scatter. Our results show that the primary parameter is the degree of (pre-)expansion before DDT-which\ndetermines the amount of mass at high density. This is, in\nturn, controlled by both the expansion rate and the plume rise\ntime. These are also expected to be the basic ingredients in\nreality.\nWhile our study is consistent with the expected theoretical brightness trend with metallicity (Timmes et al. 2003),\nobservations to date have not been able to confirm this\nprediction (Gallagher et al. 2005, 2008; Howell et al. 2009).\nThe progenitor age is difficult to decouple from metallicity given the mass-metallicity relationship within galaxy\ntypes (Gallagher et al. 2008). Additionally, the dependence of\nmean brightness of SNe Ia on the age of the parent stellar population appears to be much stronger than any dependence on\nmetallicity (Gallagher et al. 2008; Howell et al. 2009). Seemingly, the only way to observe a dependence on metallicity\nis to constrain the mean stellar age by selecting galaxies of\nthe same type. This approach was used by Gallagher et al.\n(2008), but the difficulties in accurately measuring metallicities for the parent stellar population have only constrained the\nmagnitude of the effect on mean brightness, but thus far have\nnot proved that a metallicity effect exists.\nIn order to determine the dependence of supernova brightness (56 Ni yield) on metallicity, a better understanding of\nhow the transition density is affected by changes in the 22 Ne\ncontent is needed. Currently, we have extrapolated data\n\n\f14\nfrom Chamulak et al. (2007) down to the range of expected\ntransition densities using flame data from densities above\n108 g cm\u22123 . The trend observed by Chamulak et al. (2007)\nthat increasing X22 increases the laminar flame speed is valid\nfor densities above 108 g cm\u22123 ; however, it is unclear if this\ntrend will hold for densities below 107 g cm\u22123 . Direct numerical simulations of the flame are needed for these lower\ndensities to determine whether this trend still holds. However, in this parameter space, the laminar flame is extremely\nslow requiring a low-Mach-number treatment to model the\nflow. Regardless of the choice of model for the mechanism\nthat produces a spontaneous detonation, a necessary condition\nis thought to be distributed burning. Properties of the laminar flame are necessary to estimate when burning becomes\ndistributed. Future studies exploring other DDT mechanisms\nmust also determine their compositional dependencies. So far,\nwe have only explored the effect of varying the 22 Ne content directly (Townsley et al. 2009) and indirectly through the\nDDT density. Other effects exist that we have yet to study\nsuch as the carbon composition and flame ignition density (set\nby the average progenitor age). These properties may be influenced by metallicity such that the net affect on mean brightness is negligible. Additionally, if our assumptions about the\ndependence of DDT density on metallicity are incorrect and\nfurther studies indicate the opposite trend, the metallicity effect on DDT density could negate the effect due to lepton\nnumber conservation.\nThis study stresses the importance of multi-dimensional effects, but has provided evidence of the limitations of 2D simulations of supernovae. In the immediate future, we plan\nto perform 3D simulations for better realism. In reality, we\nmight expect a two-parameter family in which the morphology of the dominant Rayleigh-Taylor plume is independent of\nthe rate of expansion; however, for our 2D simulations, these\ntwo effects appear to be correlated by the choice of cylindrical geometry. A plume developing along the symmetry axis is\nlike 3D RT compared to one near the equator, which is more\nlike 2D RT, and the latter is weaker (slower to develop). In\naddition to developing faster, plumes near the symmetry axis\nrepresent less volume and, therefore, expand the star less. A\nfast rising plume combined with a slow rate of expansion indicates there will be a shallow dependence on DDT density\n(since the plume will move through the various DDT densities faster and with less expansion). This result may also depend on our choice that DDT conditions are met at the tops\nof rising plumes. For these reasons, 3D studies are necessary\nto ascertain whether there is a physically motivated correla-\n\ntion between the dominant plume morphology and the rate of\nexpansion and whether this correlation depends on the choice\nof location of the DDT. In transitioning to 3D simulations, we\nexpect the growth of many more plumes; however, the rate of\nexpansion will likely not exceed that found in 2D. Because\nRT develops faster in 3D, the conditions for DDT will be met\nsooner leading to less overall expansion of the star and more\nmass at high density at the first DDT time. Therefore, we\nexpect 3D results similar to the higher yielding 2D realizations with a shallower dependence on DDT density. In any\ncase, this study indicates that it is possible to determine the\nsusceptibility of a particular model to a change of DDT density (and, hence, a change in the composition which alters the\nmicrophysics that set the DDT density). Once the plume morphology has been established several tenths of seconds into\nthe simulated explosion, it should be possible to estimate the\ntotal 56 Ni yield to fairly high accuracy given DDT conditions.\nHowever, the treatment of turbulent flame properties may be\nimportant.\nThis work was supported by the Department of Energy through grants DE-FG02-07ER41516, DE-FG0208ER41570, and DE-FG02-08ER41565, and by NASA\nthrough grant NNX09AD19G.
