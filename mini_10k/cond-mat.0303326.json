The associated superconducting correlations give rise to a finite value of the pair amplitude, F (r) =\nh\u03c8\u0302\u2191 (r)\u03c8\u0302\u2193 (r)i. This is known as the proximity effect.\nThe proximity effect occurs also, in a modified way, if the non-superconductor\nis a ferromagnet. In this case, F (r) exhibits spatial oscillations. On the other\nhand, the pair potential itself, \u2206(r) vanishes in the ferromagnet in the absence\nof attractive coupling. For conventional isotropic superconductors, \u2206 is spatially independent, and corresponds to the minimum excitation energy in the\nspectrum, or the energy gap, Eg . For ferromagnet-superconductor systems, as\nin other inhomogeneous cases, \u2206(r) depends on position, while the excitation\ngap for the whole system, Eg , obviously does not. The proximity effect can\ntherefore result in Eg and \u2206 possessing a rather nontrivial relationship. In this\npaper we study this question for ferromagnet-superconductor (F/S) bilayers.\nSeveral works involving nonmagnetic normal metal-superconductor heterostructures have discussed in various contexts, the presence or absence of an energy\ngap in the excitation spectrum.[2,3,4,5,6] For a normal metal layer of width\ngreater than the coherence length in the superconductor, \u03be0 , but smaller than\nthe phase coherence length L\u03c6 , the appearance of a minigap of order of the\nThouless energy has been reported, while if the normal layer is smaller than\n\u03be0 , the induced gap is of order \u2206. It was found that while interface roughness\nplays a role, the minigap persistence depends chiefly upon interface quality.[7]\nThese conclusions draw upon the results of calculations carried out within\nthe quasiclassical formalism, which is applicable when certain conditions are\nsatisfied. The main results are modified if the normal metal region is modeled\nas a non-Fermi liquid, where increased electron correlations may inhibit or\ncompletely destroy the minigap altogether.[8]\nFor F/S structures, the magnetic exchange field in the ferromagnet results in\nquasiparticle spin splitting, and consequently the pair amplitude rapidly decays and oscillates over a characteristic length scale \u03beF , in which electron-hole\npairs remain coherent. This modulation in phase of the pair amplitude has\nbeen shown to induce corresponding oscillations in the local density of states\n(DOS).[9,10,11,12] Impurities in the magnet were shown to play a significant\nrole in the determination of thermodynamic quantities.[9,11] For ballistic F/S\nstructures, the tunneling DOS for clean ferromagnet layers has been calculated\nfor a wide range of exchange fields,[12] and the local DOS has been found to\nexhibit a gapless state for all positions in the magnet.[10,13] Configurations\nconsisting of weak or thin ferromagnetic layers where dF /\u03beF \u226a 1, may lead\nto significantly different results,[14] as we shall see below. The finite geometry\ncan result in the quasiparticle amplitudes undergoing coherent Andreev and\nnormal reflection (at the ferromagnet-insulator interface) in such a way that\nthe minimum value of the excitation spectrum is nonzero due to the relatively\n2\n\n\fslow characteristic decay of the pair amplitude. Thus, a gap develops. Associated with this, when the dimensions of the ferromagnet are reduced to a scale\ncomparable to \u03beF , the greater confinement of the pairing correlations in the\nferromagnet restricts the pair amplitude so that it no longer changes sign, and\nthe DOS does not exhibit the corresponding oscillations.\nIt is generally accepted that the quasiclassical and dirty limit equations are\nsatisfactory for studying many aspects of inhomogenous superconductivity.\nIf however, the ferromagnet has dimensions of order of or smaller than the\nelastic mean free path l, so that quasiparticles undergo very few scattering\nevents, the problem is more suitably solved within the ballistic regime. Furthermore, the inherent geometrical effects associated with ferromagnet layers\nonly a few atomic spacings thick require a full microscopic theory that does not\ncoarse-grain over length scales of order of the Fermi wavelength \u03bbF . Another\nconstraint imposed upon the quasiclassical approximation is exhibited by the\nAndreev[1,15] equations, whereby values of the quasiparticle momentum parallel to the interface, and comparable to the Fermi momentum, are crudely\napproximated. We will see below that in fact these quasiparticle states play a\nprominent role in the determination of the gap threshold for F/S systems.\nThus, we examine here the electronic spectrum of F/S bilayers and investigate\nunder what conditions an energy gap can exist in such structures. The problem will be solved within the framework of the self-consistent solutions of the\nBogoliubov de-Gennes[16] (BdG) equations. We will calculate self-consistently\nthe DOS, and excitation spectra of a thin ferromagnet film adjoining a bulk superconductor. This microscopic approach complements existing quasiclassical\ntheories and serves to round the current knowledge.\nIn the next section, we introduce the method and geometry used in our model.\nIn Sec. 3, the influence of the interface transparency, the magnitude of the\nexchange field, and the mismatch in Fermi levels on the energy gap and local\nDOS, will be presented.\n\n2\n\nGeometry and model\n\nWe consider a heterojunction of total length d in the z-direction, consisting\nof a ferromagnet of thickness dF and a superconductor of thickness dS . The\nplanar interface is at z = dF , and the free surfaces at z = 0 and z = d are\nspecularly reflecting. Upon taking into account the translational invariance\nin the semi-infinite x \u2212 y plane, one can immediately write down the BdG\nequations[16,10] for the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticle and quasihole\nwave functions (u\u2191n , vn\u2193 ),\n3\n\n\fi\n1 \u22022\n+\n\u03b5\n+\nW\n(z)\n\u2212\nE\n(z)\nu\u2191n (z) + \u2206(z)vn\u2193 (z) = \u01ebn u\u2191n (z),\n\u22a5\nF\n2m \u2202z 2\ni\nh\n1 \u22022\n+\n\u03b5\n+\nW\n(z)\n\u2212\nE\n(z)\nvn\u2193 (z) + \u2206(z)u\u2191n (z) = \u01ebn vn\u2193 (z),\n\u2212\u2212\n\u22a5\nF\n2m \u2202z 2\nh\n\n\u2212\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u22a5 is the transverse kinetic energy, \u01ebn are the quasiparticle energy eigenvalues, h0 (z) = h0 \u0398(z \u2212 dF ) is the magnetic exchange energy, and \u2206(z) is\nthe pair potential. Scattering at the interface is modeled by the potential\nW (z) = W \u03b4(z \u2212 dF ), where W is the barrier strength parameter. We take the\nquantity EF (z) to equal EF M in the magnetic side, so that EF \u2191 \u2261 EF M + h0 ,\nand EF \u2193 \u2261 EF M \u2212 h0 , while in the superconducting side, EF (z) \u2261 EF . From\nthe symmetry of the problem, the solutions for the other set of wavefunctions\n(u\u2193n , vn\u2191 ) are easily obtained from those of Eqns. (1,2) by allowing for both\npositive and negative energies. The BdG equations are supplemented by the\nself consistency condition for the pair potential,\n\u2206(z) =\n\ni\ng(z) X h \u2191\nun (z)vn\u2193 (z) + u\u2193n (z)vn\u2191 (z) tanh(\u01ebn /2T ),\n2 \u01ebn \u2264\u03c9D\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, g(z) is the effective coupling constant, describing\nthe electron-electron interaction, and \u03c9D is the Debye energy.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nIn the following, we consider a thin ferromagnet layer adjacent to a bulk limit\n(dS \u226b \u03be0 ) superconductor. To focus on the parameter range which may yield\na gap in the energy spectrum, the thickness of the ferromagnet considered\nwill not exceed the coherence length in the superconductor, i.e., dF < \u03be0 . We\nintroduce the dimensionless parameter Z to characterize the barrier strength,\nwith Z \u2261 mW/kF , and the measure of mismatch between the Fermi levels is\ngiven by the ratio \u039b \u2261 EF M /EF . The requirement of self-consistency in the\nproblem excludes the possibility of an analytical solution. The BdG equations\n(1,2) are therefore solved numerically using the approach[10,17] outlined in\nthe Appendix. We assume the low temperature regime (we take T /Tc = 0.02),\nand a superconducting coherence length \u03be0 of kF \u03be0 = 50, where kF is the Fermi\nwavevector of the superconductor.\nThe energy gap, Eg , is the minimum binding energy of a Cooper pair, and\nits existence will influence various thermodynamic measurements, including\nheat capacity and thermal conductivity. For other configurations, such as long\nsuperconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions, the gap in the metal\nand the bulk gap in the superconductor can further inhibit thermal transport.\nThe process of finding Eg is computationally demanding, as it involves cal4\n\n\fFig. 1. Variation of the normalized energy gap in the ferromagnet with the dimensionless ferromagnet thickness kF dF . The coherence length is given by kF \u03be0 = 50.\nThe different curves correspond to the four values of the magnetic exchange energy\nlabeled in the figure.\n\nculating self-consistently the entire eigenvalue spectrum and then finding its\nminimum, for each value of dF . In Fig.1 we illustrate our results for the dependence of Eg on the thickness of the ferromagnet layer. These results are for\nZ = 0 and \u039b = 1. Results for four different exchange fields in the ferromagnet\nare presented. The top dashed curve corresponds to h0 /\u22060 = 0, while the subsequent lower curves are for finite values of the exchange field as labeled in the\nfigure. All curves start at Eg = \u22060 for dF = 0, corresponding to the expected\nresult for a single superconductor in the bulk limit. As the ferromagnet layer\ngrows, Eg decays monotonically towards a gapless superconducting state, at a\nrate that depends strongly on the strength of h0 . In the limit of zero exchange\nfield (normal metal), the gap ceases to exist when dF \u2248 \u03be0 . This thickness at\nwhich Eg is destroyed is much smaller than the proximity length characterizing the usual very slow decay of the pair amplitude in the metal.[18] This\ntrend continues for finite h0 , with Eg vanishing much more rapidly than the\ncharacteristic decay length of the pair amplitude in the magnet. To illustrate\nthis, recall[17,19] the approximate expression for the characteristic length of\ndecay of the pair amplitude in the ferromagnet: \u03beF \u2248 (kF \u2191 \u2212 kF \u2193 )\u22121 , which\n5\n\n\fFig. 2. Part of the normalized self consistent quasiparticle spectrum as obtained\nfor given values of the normalized transverse energy \u03b5\u22a5 /EF . The parameter h0 /\u22060\nis chosen to be 0.8, and kF dF = 15. The region |\u01ebn /\u22060 | > 1 is dominated by the\ncontinuum sates, these are suppressed for clarity.\n\ncan be rewritten as,\n\u22060\n\u03c0\nkF \u03be 0 .\nkF M \u03beF \u2248 \u039b3/2\n2\nh0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4)\n\nThus for example, the h0 /\u22060 = 4.0 curve in Fig. 1 shows the energy gap\nvanishing at kF M dF \u2248 7.5, while the pair amplitude decays over the larger\nlength scale kF M \u03beF \u2248 20. The discrepancy is even larger if one recalls that\nthe expected decay length might be thought to be a factor of 2\u03c0 larger. For\nthe largest field shown (h0 /\u22060 = 8), the superconducting correlations are\nfurther inhibited, failing to generate a gap in the energy spectrum except for\nferromagnet nanostructures satisfying kF dF . 5.\nTo provide additional perspective on the spectral features of the proximity\neffect, we show in Fig. 2 a relevant portion (|\u01ebn /\u22060 | \u2264 1) of the calculated\neigenvalues as obtained (under the same conditions as in the previous Figure)\nfor given transverse energies, \u03b5\u22a5 . For a homogeneous superconductor, a gap\nseparates the continuum states that exist for |\u01ebn /\u22060 | > 1. With the inclusion\nof a ferromagnet, in addition to the scattering states there exists a discrete\nquasiparticle excitation spectrum in the range |\u01ebn /\u22060 | < 1 (see Fig. 2). The\nbound states are visibly asymmetric about the Fermi level due to the effects\n6\n\n\fthe exchange field has on the particle-hole amplitudes. The existence of a\nfinite number of bound-state branches of localized quasiparticles is also characteristic of antisymmetric domain walls.[20] In Fig. 2 we can further see that\nthe minimum in |\u01ebn |, which corresponds to the energy gap seen in Fig. 1 for\nkF dF = 15, where Eg \u2248 0.09\u22060 , is sharp, and that it occurs for quasiparticles\nwhose in-plane momentum is close to the Fermi level (\u03b5\u22a5 /EF \u2243 1). This is due\nin part to those quasiparticles not coupling to those states responsible for superconductivity. This result is typical of what we find for other exchange fields,\nthe only difference being the value of Eg [see Fig. 1]. It is therefore those excitations with a dominant momentum component parallel to the interface, that are\nsignificant in contributing to the filling in of the gap. In the Andreev or quasiclassical approximation scheme, these quasiparticles have \"trajectories\" which\nare not treated accurately, and those with \u03b5\u22a5 /EF > 1 are neglected altogether.\nThis discrepancy has also been revealed[15] in normal metal-superconductor\nsystems, where normal reflection dominates the Andreev reflection process for\nquasiparticles with large momentum parallel to the interface.\nThe previous results in Fig. 1 showed the strong influence the exchange energy\nhas on Eg . Another quantity of great experimental interest is the local density\nof one particle excitations in the magnet. Current experimental tools such as\nthe scanning tunneling microscope (STM) have atomic scale resolution, and\nmake this quantity experimentally accessible. When well defined quasiparticles\nexist, the tunneling current is simply expressed as a convolution of the oneparticle spectral function of the STM tip with the spectral function for the F/S\nsystem.[21] The resultant tunneling conductance, which is proportional to the\ndensity of states (DOS), is then given as a sum of the individual contributions\nto the DOS from each spin channel.\nN(z, \u03b5) = N\u2191 (z, \u03b5) + N\u2193 (z, \u03b5),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the local DOS for each spin state is given by\n\nN\u2191 (z, \u01eb) = \u2212\nN\u2193 (z, \u01eb) = \u2212\n\nXn\nn\n\no\n\n[u\u2191n (z)]2 f \u2032 (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebn ) + [vn\u2191 (z)]2 f \u2032 (\u01eb + \u01ebn ) ,\n\nXn\nn\n\no\n\n[u\u2193n (z)]2 f \u2032 (\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebn ) + [vn\u2193 (z)]2 f \u2032 (\u01eb + \u01ebn ) .\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nHere thermal broadening is accounted for by the derivative of the Fermi function, f \u2032 (\u01eb) = \u2202f /\u2202\u01eb. To investigate further how the previous results interrelate\nwith the local DOS (Eq. 5), we show in Fig. 3 the local DOS N(\u01eb), defined\nas N(z, \u03b5) integrated over the ferromagnetic layer. This quantity is shown for\ntwo exchange fields, differing by a factor of ten. The ferromagnet has a thickness of dF = 9kF\u22121 : from Fig. 1 this corresponds to an energy gap of Eg \u2248 0.5\nfor h0 /\u22060 = 0.8, and an absence of an energy gap for h0 /\u22060 = 8. This is\n7\n\n\fFig. 3. Density of states in the ferromagnet (see text) for two exchange energies\nand a fixed width kF dF = 9. The bold curve corresponds to h0 /\u22060 = 0.8, and\nthe dashed curve to h0 /\u22060 = 8. The DOS is normalized to N (0), the DOS of the\nsuperconductor in the normal state, and the energies are normalized to \u22060 . The\ninset reveals the same quantities, magnified to clarify the gap region. As in previous\nFigures, we assume no interfacial scattering and no Fermi wavevector mismatch:\nZ = 0, \u039b = 1.\n\nconsistent with the DOS calculations, as Fig. 3 illustrates: for the smaller exchange field, there is a complete absence of states for \u01eb/\u22060 . 0.5, while the\nDOS is gapless at all energies for h0 /\u22060 = 8. The observed energy gap for\nh0 /\u22060 = 0.8 is a result of the underlying competition between quantum size\neffects and constructive interference between the spin-split quasiparticle amplitudes. As expected, the particle-hole asymmetry is more prevalent in the\nstronger magnet (within the subgap region), as the two uppermost peaks are\nclearly shifted relative to one another.\nNext we consider the effect that an interface barrier or Fermi energy mismatch\nhas on the electronic structure. Experimentally, some degree of Fermi energy\nmismatch is unavoidable, particularly with alloys, and the transparency of\nthe interface can be degraded due to a thin oxide layer. In Fig. 4 we illustrate\nthe normalized energy gap Eg as a function of kF M dF (where kF M is the\nwavevector corresponding to EF M ), for two \u039b and Z values that each differ\nby a factor of three. We fix the exchange field at h0 = 0.8\u22060 , keeping in mind\nthat higher fields obey similar trends so that generality is not lost. Also, in\n8\n\n\fFig. 4. Influence of interface scattering and Fermi energy mismatch on the energy\ngap as a function of the ferromagnet thickness. Both the effects of increasing the\nmismatch (decreasing \u039b from unity, see text) and increasing scattering strength\n(increasing Z) serve to destroy the energy gap Eg at an increased rate.\n\norder to isolate each of the effects, whenever \u039b is different from unity, Z is\nzero, and vice versa. The figure shows that increased mismatch (smaller \u039b) or\nincreased interface scattering (larger Z), induces the same trend of reducing\nEg as a function of kF M dF . The functional form of the graphs are distinct\nhowever: for \u039b < 1, the tail-end decay is slower than the near linear decay in\nEg exhibited in the case of finite Z. Further differences in the effects of the\ntwo parameters are even more evident in the DOS spectra. To this end, Fig. 5\nshows the DOS in the ferromagnet for two different values of the mismatch\nparameter \u039b, and one value of Z. Upon comparison with the previous Fig. 4,\nwe again find consistency between the DOS and Eg calculations: the energy\ngap is reduced at kF M dF = 10 for both \u039b = 0.2, and Z = 0.2. This is reflected\nin the DOS, where Fig. 5 illustrates a small but finite number of states centered\nabout the Fermi level. Although the quasiparticle spectrum has just turned\ngapless for \u039b = 0.2, and Z = 0.2, the DOS signature is substantially different,\nthe most prominent feature being the larger number of subgap bound states\nfor \u039b = 0.2, which can be attributed to the larger Fermi energy mismatch,\nand subsequently, increased normal reflections.\n9\n\n\fFig. 5. Local DOS in the ferromagnet of width kF M dF = 10. The bold curve corresponds to Z = 0.2, and the dotted and dashed curves are for the cases \u039b = 0.6, and\n\u039b = 0.2 respectively. For the given dimensions of the magnet, the inset reveals that\nonly when \u039b = 0.6 does a gap survive in the energy spectrum. At\u221ahigher energies\nthe curves are clearly displaced from one another by a factor of \u039b, due to the\nnormalization.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have self-consistently calculated the electronic structure for a F/S heterostructure consisting of a thin ferromagnet layer adjoining a bulk superconductor. Our fully microscopic method revealed the dependence of the transition to a gapless superconducting state on the relevant physical parameters\nsuch as exchange field energy, interface transparency, and Fermi energy mismatch. The energy gap decreases with the width of the F layer at a rate that\ndepends upon the dimensionless ferromagnet width kF M dF . The characteristic\nlength for gap suppression is much smaller than the length scale describing the\ndecay of the pair amplitude in the ferromagnet: thus Eg is suppressed more\nrapidly than the pair amplitude. Fermi level mismatch and interface barrier\nboth serve to reduce the gap further, however the functional forms of the respective reductions are different. The local DOS in the ferromagnet is in all\ncases consistent with the above observations. The self-consistent quasiparticle\nspectra reveals that the gap onset is due to quasiparticle states with a large\nmomentum component parallel to the interface. These states however, occupy\n10\n\n\fa relatively small region of momentum space, and when calculating integral\nquantities over the full solid angle, good agreement between our exact theory\nand quasiclassical theory might be possible.\nWe have focused here on the spectral properties of the ferromagnet, in the\nclean limit. This regime is most appropriate for layers whose dimensions do\nnot exceed the mean free path (dF . l). Since, we have considered only thin\nlayers, this assumption is consistent with our calculations. For situations where\nthe effects of impurities or inelastic effects may be important, a finite DOS\nat low energies would likely arise. The general method used here however has\nfound good overall agreement with experiments involving thin nonmagnetic\nnormal metal-superconductor bilayers, and bulk F/S structures.[17] Furthermore, previous calculations[13,22] within the ballistic limit have also found\nagreement with experiment. Other complexities may arise in actual experimental conditions, such as grain boundaries and domain walls not accounted for\nhere. The fabrication of relatively clean heterostructures,[23,24] and structures\nwith highly transparent interfaces[25] is possible however. Our calculations are\ntherefore realistic, and the results should be reproducible experimentally.\n\nA\n\nNumerical method\n\nWe solve Eqns. (1,2) by expanding the quasiparticle amplitudes in terms of\nP\na finite subset of a set of orthonormal basis vectors, u\u2191n (z) = q u\u2191nq \u03c6q (z),\nP \u2193\nand vn\u2193 (z) = q vnq\n\u03c6q (z). We use the complete set of eigenfunctions \u03c6q (z) =\nq\n\nhz|qi = 2/d sin(kq z), where kq = q/\u03c0d, and q is a positive integer. The finite\nrange of the pairing interaction \u03c9D permits the number N of such basis vectors\nto be cut off in the usual way.[10] Once this is done, we arrive at the following\n2N \u00d7 2N matrix eigensystem,\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n+\nD \uf8fa\n\uf8efH\n\uf8fb \u03a8n = \u01ebn \u03a8n ,\n\uf8f0\nD H\u2212\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n+\nwhere \u03a8Tn = (u\u2191n1 , . . . , u\u2191nN , vn1\n, . . . , vnN\n).
