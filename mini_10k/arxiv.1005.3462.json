In this new approach, we make explicit and decouple the timescales associated (a) with disruptive effects the star formation event itself, from (b) the\ntimescales associated with the cloud assembly and collapse mechanisms leading\nup to star formation. The star formation law in near-by galaxies, as measured\non sub-kiloparsec scales, has recently been shown by Bigiel et al. to be distinctly\nnon-linear in its dependence on total gas density. Our parameterization of the\nspatially resolved Schmidt-Sanduleak relation naturally accommodates that dependence. The parameterized form of the relation is \u03c1\u2217 \u223c \u01eb\u03c1g /(\u03c4s + \u03c1\u2212n\ng ), where\n\u03c1g is the gas density, \u01eb is the efficiency of converting gas into stars, and \u03c1\u2212n\ng captures the physics of cloud collapse. Accordingly at high gas densities quiescent\nstar formation is predicted to progress as \u03c1\u2217 \u223c \u03c1g , while at low gas densities\n\u03c1\u2217 \u223c \u03c11+n\n, as is now generally observed. A variable efficiency in locally cong\nverting gas into stars as well as the unknown plane thickness variations from\ngalaxy to galaxy, and radially within a given galaxy, can readily account for the\nempirical scatter in the observed (surface density rather than volume density)\nrelations, and also plausibly account for the noted upturn in the relation at very\nhigh apparent projected column densities.\nSubject headings: galaxies: evolution \u2013 galaxies: spiral \u2013 stars: formation\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Schmidt Law has become widely synonymous with any power-law relation between\na (local or even global) star formation rate indicator (be it individual OB stars, HII regions,\nH\u03b1 luminosity, UV luminosity, re-radiated 24\u03bcm radiation or the strength of a [C IV] cooling\nline) and a corresponding measure of gas density (originally HI and now more frequently H2 ,\nor a summed combination of the two)1 . Schmidt (1957, 1963) first proposed such a formalism\nafter noting that within the context of the Milky Way the gas scale height (the fuel for star\nformation) was larger than the O-star scale height (the result of star formation) suggesting a\nnon-linear (plausibly a power-law) causally connected relationship between the two. Schmidt\nconcluded that the exponent connecting gas density to star formation had a value of n \u223c\n2. Subsequently, (with the exception of a solitary paper by Guibery, Lequeux & Viallefond\n1978, again dealing with the Milky Way star formation and gas scale heights) little interest\nin this topic was visible for more than a decade.\nThe field became active again when some years later Sanduleak (1968) offered a novel\ncalibration of the Schmidt Law in an extragalactic context. Rather than working with scale\nheights he examined the relationship between neutral hydrogen gas surface densities and the\nprojected surface densities of recently-formed and individually resolved OB stars. We refer\nhereafter to this spatially resolved correlation of star formation tracers with projected gas\nsurface density as the Schmidt-Sanduleak Law, so as to clearly distinguish it from the global\nrelation linking the total star formation rate with total gas content, often referred to as the\nSchmidt-Kennicutt Law. For OB stars and neutral hydrogen gas in the SMC Sanduleak\nfound \u03a3stars \u223c \u03a31.84\u00b10.14\n.\ngas\nSanduleak's particular technique in his pioneering study was extended to other galaxies\nand in the process also generalized to different star-formation tracers. For instance, Hartwick\n(1971) correlated HII region surface densities with neutral hydrogen surface densities for the\nLocal Group galaxy M31, and derived an exponent n = 3.50 \u00b1 0.12. Madore, van den Bergh\n& Rogstad (1974) combined the methods of Sanduleak and Hartwick and correlated both\nstar counts and HII regions with HI surface densities across the face of M33. They found\ndifferences2 between between the two tracers as well as differences as a function of radius;\nthe latter, being suggested by them, as being plausibly due to plane thickness variations.\n1\n2\n\nFor a comprehensive and tutorial review see Leroy et al. (2008), Section 2 and especially Table 1.\n\nAnd with the clarity of hindsight one can see a flattening of the power-law relation at high gas densities\nin the M33 data both for the stars and for the HII regions (their Figures 3 and 4); however it was clearly\ntoo early in the game to be introducing even more variables than had already been considered in this early\npaper.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThey found exponents ranging from n = 0.57 to 2.57, depending on the tracer and the radial\nregion considered, with the outer regions showing a steeper dependence. Tosa & Hamajima\n(1975), Hamajima & Tosa, (1975) followed Hartwick's lead and also used HII region number\ndensities and correlated these with the available neutral hydrogen surface densities. They\nfound exponents ranging from n = 1.5 to 3.5 in 7 galaxies (SMC, LMC, M31, M51, M101,\nNGC 2403 and NGC 6946). Their analysis again suggested that the relation was a function\nof radius where in the examples of M31 and M101 the exponent was again found to be larger\nin the outer regions when compared to the inner disk. More recently, Bigiel et al. (2008)\nexamined the spatially resolved star formation law in 18 nearby galaxies using both UV\n(GALEX) and IR (Spitzer) data to characterize the on-going star formation, and exploring\nboth molecular, neutral and total hydrogen gas content as control variables. They found\nthat for total gas (surface) densities in excess of 1M\u2299 pc\u22122 the star formation rate scaled\nlinearly with total gas (i.e., n = 1.0\u00b10.2), but at lower gas surface densities the power law\nsteepens considerably and is widely dispersed (see their composite Figures 10 and 15, and\nFigure 1 below).\nWe now proceed to give a physically motivated, analytic expression capturing these\nfacts. It is hoped that with this formulation galaxy evolution modellers will be able to\nexploit this simple parametric means of predicting star formation rates based on local gas\ndensities.\n\n2.\n\nTimescale Arguments\n\nNumerical simulations of star formation, in search of the underlying parameterization of\nthe causal relation between observed gas densities and current star formation rates, were first\npresented by Madore (1977). There it was pointed out that if the star formation rate was\ndimensionally decomposed into its native sub-components of a mass and a timescale then the\nfirst term naturally scaled directly as the mean density and the latter term, the timescale,\nwould only have to scale as \u03c1\u22121/2 in order to give n = 1.5, a value which seemed to be\nbroadly supported by the observations of the time. That is, the star formation rate fSF R =\nM\u2217 /\u03c4SF R \u221d \u03c1g /\u03c1g \u22121/2 \u221d \u03c1g 3/2 . Many gravitationally controlled timescales depend on \u03c1g \u22121/2\nso there was some early, but still a posteriori, justification for this particular interpretation.\nHowever gravity is not the only mechanism operating in the production of stars. And\nso we ask what are the various modes of star formation that might be considered in trying\nto predict an appropriate timescale for star formation? And what might the controlling\nparameters be for those different modes? Here we simply enumerate four main modes that\nappear to be operating, and then we focus our attention primarily on the first, quiescient star\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nformation. Lessons learned here, we believe, can be applied in provisionally parameterizing\nthe other modes of star formation as well.\nFour distinct modes of star formation, whose rates are individually determined by independent physics and very different timescales, immediately suggest themselves: (1) a secular\ntimescale \u03c4c for unforced, that is to say, quiescent star formation across the galaxy in question, regulated primarily by the natural cloud coalescence and collapse timescales, (2) an\ninduced star-formation timescale, \u03c4d , which is determined by quasi-periodic phenomena that\nare internal to the galaxy, such as density waves, rotating bars, etc., (3) an impulsive star\nformation timescale, \u03c4e , which is determined by external, and generally aperiodic encounters\nor collisions with other nearby galaxies or satellites, and finally (4) a flow timescale, \u03c4f ,\ndetermining the rate of star formation particularly in the nuclear regions of (typically starburst) galaxies, where angular momentum loss mechanisms are probably the rate-limiting\nfactors.\n\n2.1.\n\nQuiescent Star Formation\n\nIn this Letter we focus exclusively on parameterizing the quiescent mode of star formation. Starting afresh, from dimensional arguments alone we develop a simplified parameterization of the rate of star formation that now captures the essential non-linear form (Bigiel\net al. 2008) of the current observational correlations. In the life cycle of gas, from its diffuse\nstate into collapsing clouds, through the phase change called star formation and finally the\ncloud's disruption and redispersal before it begins the cycle again, two critical timescales are\nidentified: (1) a cloud coalescence/(re)collapse timescale \u03c4c , characterizing the systematic\nassembly and/or re-assembly of neutral hydrogen into a molecular cloud and its subsequent\ndevelopment of a dense core, ultimately leading to the observed star formation event, and\nthen (2) a star-formation-induced \"stagnation\" timescale, \u03c4s , determined by the presence of\nhot stars and their disruptive interaction with the birth cloud.\nSuch a characterization involving two independent timescales is not just convenient, it is\nmethodologically required, because what is done observationally amounts to selecting regions\nthat have a given column density of gas and then equating the relative areal frequency of\nthose regions with a relative temporal frequency (i.e., a cumulative timescale or lifetime) for\nthat density. However that cumulative timescale must itself be the sum of two independent\ntimescales, \u03c4s and \u03c4c , only one of which, \u03c4c , is assumed here to be a function of the gas\ndensity; the other timescale, \u03c4s , being a function of stellar astrophysics and gas heating. The\nargument is that empirically one needs to take observations, which are per force averages\nover areas, and map them to a theory that involves averages over time. Those regions of\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nfixed surface density that define the areas are either occupied by currently observabale star\nformation tracers or they are not. The occupied time is the interval over which the most\nrecently formed stars (and stellar physics) control the gas dynamics; the unoccupied time is\nprimarily the cloud assembly and collapse time, where gas density (and more generally gas\nphysics alone) is assumed to be the controling factor. These are two physically distinct and\nseparable processes that have independent timescales; however, it is their sum that enters\ninto the mapping from the time domain to any given, instantaneously observed, spatial\ncoverage.\nThe stagnation time, \u03c4s , is ultimately a measure of the (wavelength-independent) timescale\nover which the general presence of ionization fronts, winds, radiation pressure, SNe, and other\ndisrupting effects of the star-formation events influence the gaseous environment, by stalling\nand otherwise preventing the onset of the next cycle of star formation in that same region.\nAs such \u03c4s it is not a timescale to be equated with the lifetime of an individual O star or a\nB star per se, but rather it is a timescale to be associated with \"the disruptive presence of\nstars, and the star formation event in general\". It is associated with stellar lifetimes but it\nis a single time period for a given region and it will not be a function of wavelength (H\u03b1 , vs\nFUV) or any given selected tracer (O stars or B stars). The best that can be said is that\nit will be at least as long as the longest-lived (high-mass) stars and those by-products (i.e.,\nType II supernovae) that influence the structure of the local medium in a way that they\ncollectively delay the onset of the next re-coalescence and collapse sequence. Some fraction\nof the stagnation time will also be coupled to the time it takes gas to recombine after being\nionized by the HII region, or to cool back down after being shocked by a supernova blast\nwave, and both of these are admittedly strong (n2e ) functions of electron density, but since\nthe observed control parameter being considered here is the neutral and/or molecular gas\ndensity, to first order, \u03c4s should be decoupled.\nWe equate the \"star formation rate\" fSF R , with the mass of recently formed stars M\u2217\ndivided by some characteristic timescale \u03c4 such that fSF R = M\u2217 /\u03c4 . We now assume some\nefficiency \u01eb for converting into stars the total available gas mass Mg , contained in some\nfixed volume V , such that M\u2217 = \u01ebMg = \u01ebV \u03c1g . Furthermore we break \u03c4 down into its\ntwo rate-limiting timescales, \u03c4s and \u03c4c , which, as mentioned above, are the star-formationinduced, cloud-disruption timescales and the neutral-to-molecular cloud formation/collapse\ntimescales, respectively. Accordingly,\nfSF R =\n\nM\u2217\n\u01ebV \u03c1g\n=\n\u03c4\n(\u03c4s + \u03c4c )\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The rate of star formation \u03a3SF R versus total gas (molecular + neutral hydrogen) surface\ndensity \u03a3H2 +HI for sub-kiloparsec sampled galaxies in Bigiel et al (2008), with the appropriately\nnormalized prediction from Equation 1 superimposed on his Figure 8. The asymptotic linear (unit\nslope) behavior predicted by Equation 1 is seen at high gas surface densities with an increasingly\nsteeper fall-off toward low gas densities. This particular (discretely sampled) solution is for illustrative purposes only; it is chosen as a representative fit to the general trend in the cumulative\nplot. However, it does show show how the linear regime is approached at high gas surface densities,\nand in this particular example the solution asymptotically approaches a power law with n = 2.5\nat low gas densities. The dotted lines of unit slope crossing the diagram correspond to the levels\nof constant star formation efficiency needed to consume 1, 10 and 100% of the gas reservoir in 108\nyears.

All of the sub-resolution physics and astrophysics of\ncloud formation and collapse is secreted away in this simple parameterization on the cloud\nstagnation timescales (\u03c4s ) and local gas densities (\u03c1\u2212n ). Other modes of star formation\nof course exist, and because of the very different physics involved, they deserve their own\nparameterization; but the simple timescale framework should in principle accommodate these\nother modes as well. The collisionally driven (impulsive) star formation rate \u03c4c would have\na timescale set by the local galaxian environment. The internally driven star formation\nrates due to density waves would have their timescales \u03c4D strictly set locally at a given\ngalactocentric radius by 1/| \u03a9pattern \u2212\u03a9rotation |, where the denominator is the rate of passage\nof material through the density wave of fixed pattern speed. Finally, one could imagine\nfinding an appropriate timescale \u03c4E for the transfer of angular momentum regulating the\nflow of material into the central regions of galaxies where starburst activity then occurs.\nIn any case the simple dimensionality of the proposed parameterization guarantees some\nmeasure of success; the novelty is in decoupling and making explicit the star formation\ntracer's visibility timescale from the independent assembly/formation/collision timescale.\nThere are, of course, other proposed parameterizations of star formation rates, many\nof which are far more bottom-up and physically based rather than the top-down and more\nphenomenologically motivated approach historically made and adopted here. Dopita has\nlong argued for a \"compound\" Schmidt Law (e.g. Dopita & Ryder 1994 and references\ntherein) that depends both on local gas density and the total surface density of matter. Silk\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n(1997) argues that the SFR is self-regulated with gravitational instability playing off against\nsupernova heating of the interstellar medium. Tan (2000) suggested that the cloud-cloud\ncollision timescale was the rate-limiting factor for star formation; while Krumhotz & McKee\n(2005) suggested a simple linear relation holds between the surface density of molecular hydrogen and SFR based on the suggestion that the free-fall time for giant molecular clouds is a\nlargely independent of the cloud mass (Solomon et al. 1987). Li, Mac Low & Klessen (2005)\ninvestigated the role played gravitational instabilities controling star formation rates using\na three-dimensional, smooth particle hydro code. Simulations by Dobbs & Pringle (2009)\nsimply tie the SFR to the local dynamical timescale of the gas. Finally, Blitz & Rosolowsky\n(2006 and earlier references therein) suggest that mid-plane pressure is the controling factor\nin converting HI into its molecular phase and then on to star formation. A detailed comparison of the predictions of some of these models, as well as a number of thresholding scenarios,\nwith the available observations has been given in Leroy et al. (2008) and the interested\nreader is referred to that paper for a detailed discussion of their relative merits and degrees\nof success in matching the observations.\nThe observed rate of star formation is further complicated in the high density nuclear\nregions of galaxies that are probably not undergoing typical, quiescent star formation that\nis the main focus of this Letter. At very high column densities, often only found in the\nnuclear regions of galaxies, the raw correlation of star formation rates with very high gas\ncolumn densities appears to steepen with respect to the relation found the lower-density main\ndisk. Assuming that the molecular fraction has been properly estimated and/or measured,\nwe have two possible explanations for these observations, both of which may be operating\nin any given situation. First, the plane thinkness in these inner regions may be playing a\nfactor in increasing the volume gas density without necessarily changing the apparent column\ndensity. Adopting a standard (outer disk) Schmidt law would result in the observed upturn\nin the correlation because of the increased volume gas density and the non-linear response\nin the production of stars each of which are only measured in projection.\nIn addition to, or independently of, any plane thickness compression at very high (nuclear) gas densities the same steepening of the observed relation can be easily induced by another plausible effect, beam dilution. If, within the naturally imposed or artificially selected\nresolution element empirically used to make the star-tracer and gas density correlations, the\nactual size of the region undergoing star formation is smaller than the beam then, as in\nthe case of the decreasing plane thickness situation above, the appropriate volume density\nof the region actually undergoing star formation will be much higher in reality than the\nbeam-smeared and diluted column density would suggest. If this is indeed the case, then\nthe observed correlation of star density versus projected gas surface density would steepen,\nbecause of the highly non-linear underlying sensitivity of the rate of star formation to volume\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndensity.\n\nThis study made use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract\nwith the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
