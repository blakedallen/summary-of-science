The most enigmatic features\nare associated with the so-called glitches, sudden spinup events followed by a relaxation towards steady longterm spin-down. Several hundred glitches, with magnitude in the range \u2206\u03a9c /\u03a9c \u2248 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126 where \u03a9c is the\nobserved rotation frequency, have now been observed in\nover 100 pulsars [1]. The archetypal glitching pulsar is\nVela, which exhibits regular large glitches. Glitches have\nalso been reported in several magnetars [2] as well as one,\nvery slowly rotating, accreting neutron star [3].\nDespite the relative wealth of observational data our\ntheoretical understanding of glitches has not advanced\nconsiderably in recent years. The standard \"model\" for\nlarge pulsar glitches envisages a sudden transfer of angular momentum from a superfluid component to the rest of\nthe star [4], which includes the crust (to which the pulsar\nmechanism is assumed rigidly attached) and the charged\nmatter in the core. A superfluid rotates by forming a\ndense array of vortices, and the vortex configuration determines the global rotation. The key idea for explaining\nglitches is that, if the superfluid vortices are pinned to\nthe other component, a rotational lag builds up as the\ncrust spins down due to electromagnetic braking. Once\nthe rotational lag reaches some critical level, the pinning\nbreaks. This allows the vortices to move, which leads to\na transfer of angular momentum between the two components and the observed spin-up of the crust.\nMost theoretical work has focused on either the\nstrength of the vortex pinning [5, 6] or the post-glitch\nevolution [7]. There have not been many suggestions for\nthe mechanism that triggers the glitch in the first place.\nIt is generally expected that this role will be played by\nsome kind of instability, but there are few truly quantitative models. The results presented in this Letter change\nthe situation dramatically. We present evidence for a new\ninstability, acting on the inertial modes of a rotating superfluid star, that sets in beyond a critical rotational lag.\nThe predictions of this model agree well with the obser-\n\nvational data making it plausible that this mechanism\nprovides a missing piece in the pulsar glitch puzzle.\nInertial mode analysis. - We want to improve our understanding of the global hydrodynamics associated with\na pulsar glitch. Even though this should be a key issue, it\nhas not been discussed in detail previously. In principle,\none would expect to be able to express the dynamics in\nterms of global oscillation modes of the system. In this\nLetter we present the first results for inertial modes of\nneutron star models with the two main features required\nfor the standard glitch models, a superfluid neutron component that rotates at a rate different from that of the\ncrust and pinned neutron vortices.\nWe use the standard two-fluid model for superfluid\nneutron stars (see for example [8]), identifying the two\ncomponents with the neutron superfluid and a conglomerate of all charged particles (the \"protons\"). In the\nfollowing, the index x = {n, p} identifies the distinct\nfluids. Our aim is to model small amplitude oscillations with respect to a background configuration where\nboth fluids rotate rigidly with (parallel) angular velocities\nvxi = \u01ebijk \u03a9xj xk and where the magnitudes are different,\n\u03a9n 6= \u03a9p . The linear perturbations of this system (assuming a time dependence \u223c exp(i\u03c3t)) are, in the inertial\nframe, described by the two coupled Euler equations,\n\u0001\ni\n(1)\ni\u03c3 + vnj \u2207j \u03b4vni + \u03b4vnj \u2207j vni + \u2207i \u03b4\u03c8n = \u03b4fmf\ni\n\u0001\n\u03b4f\ni\u03c3 + vpj \u2207j \u03b4vpi + \u03b4vpj \u2207j vpi + \u2207i \u03b4\u03c8p = \u2212 mf (2)\nxp\nHere \u03b4\u03c8x = \u03b4 \u03bc\u0303x +\u03b4\u03a6 represents the sum of the perturbed\nspecific chemical potential and gravitational potential.\nWe have also introduced xp = \u03c1p /\u03c1n . This ratio, which is\nroughly equal to the proton fraction, is assumed constant\nthroughout the star. For simplicity, we assume that the\ntwo fluids are incompressible, which means that \u2207i \u03b4vxi =\n0. In general, the two fluids are coupled i) chemically,\nii) gravitationally, iii) via the entrainment effect, and iv)\ni\nby the vortex mediated mutual friction fmf\n. For clarity,\nwe will ignore the entrainment in the present analysis.\nA detailed discussion of how the entrainment affects our\nresults will be provided elsewhere.\n\n\f2\nFor the inertial modes, the main coupling mechanism\nis provided by the mutual friction force. The general\nexpression for this force is [9],\nn np\nk\nfimf = B\u01ebijk \u01ebkml \u03c9\u0302nj \u03c9m\nwl + B \u2032 \u01ebijk \u03c9nj wnp\n\n(3)\n\ni\nwhere wnp\n= vni \u2212 vpi and \u03c9ni = \u01ebijk \u2207j vkn . A \"hat\" denotes a unit vector. When the two fluids are not coroi\ntating, the perturbed force \u03b4fmf\nis quite complex [10].\ni\nThe form (3) for fmf results from balancing the Magnus force that acts on the neutron vortices and a resistive \"drag\" force which represents the interaction between the vortices and the charged fluid. Representing\nthe drag force by a dimensionless coefficient R, one finds\nthat B \u2032 = RB = R2 /(1 + R2 ). The range of values\nthat R takes in a neutron star is not well known. The\nstandard assumption in studies of neutron star oscillations has been that the drag is weak, which means that\nB \u2032 \u226a B \u226a 1. Then the second term in (3) has no effect on\nthe dynamics. However, it may well be the opposite limit\nthat applies. The vortices in a neutron star core may experience a strong drag force if their interaction with the\nmagnetic fluxtubes is efficient [11, 12]. The drag on the\nsuperfluid in the crust may also be strong due to vortex\n\"pinning\" by the lattice nuclei. Even though the current\nevidence [5, 6] favours weak crustal pinning, the existence\nof strong pinning regions has not been completely ruled\nout. In these cases one must consider the strong coupling\nlimit R \u226b 1 which leads to B \u2248 0 and B \u2032 \u2248 1.\nThe hydrodynamical equations (1)-(2) allow for a rich\nset of oscillation modes. Our focus will be on a subset\nof the inertial modes, the purely axial r-modes. The rmodes have attracted considerable attention since they\nmay suffer a gravitational-driven instability [13]. They\nhave been studied in superfluid neutron stars previously\n[14, 15, 16], but not accounting for both mutual friction\nand a rotational lag. When expressed in terms of spherical harmonics, the r-mode velocity fields take the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nU x \u2202\u03b8 Ylm i\nimU x Y m\n(4)\n\u00ea\u03c6 ei\u03c3t\n\u03b4vxi = \u2212 2 l 2 l \u00eai\u03b8 + l2\nr sin \u03b8\nr sin \u03b8\n\nIn the corresponding single fluid problem such purely axial solutions exist, corresponding to a single l = m multipole. The solution (4) satisfies the continuity equations\nautomatically, which means that we only have to consider the two Euler equations. Inserting (4) in (1)-(2) and\neliminating \u03b4\u03c8x one arrives at two equations for Ulx . As\nin the single fluid inertial mode problem, these relations\nfeature couplings between different l multipoles. In the\npresent problem these couplings are further complicated\ni\nby the presence of \u03b4fmf\n. As a result, one would expect\nthe problem to be difficult to solve. Remarkably, this is\nnot the case. It turns out that, even when \u03a9n 6= \u03a9p , there\nx\nexists a simple l = m solution of the form Um\n= Ax rm+1 .\nThis solution is exact at leading order in rotation and for\nall values of R. The amplitudes Ax follow from the solu-\n\ntion of a 2 \u00d7 2 algebraic system, the determinant of which\nprovides the dispersion relation for the mode frequency.\nA new superfluid instability.- The strong coupling\nlimit, B = 0 and B \u2032 = 1, provides a good illustration\nof the main new result. In this case we obtain a simple\nmode solution.

Taking m \u226b 1 and recalling that xp and \u2206 are both small\n(generally \u2206 \u226a xp ), it is easy to show that one of the\nabove r-mode solutions becomes unstable (Im[\u03ba] < 0) for\nm > mc , where\n1\n\u2248 320\nmc \u2248 p\n2xp \u2206\n\n\u0012\n\n0.05\nxp\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\n10\u22124\n\u2206\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(9)\n\nFor m \u226b mc the instability growth timescale \u03c4grow =\n1/(\u03a9p Im[\u03ba]) is well approximated by\nr\n\n\u0010 x \u00111/2\nxp\np\n\u2248 0.25\n2\u2206\n0.05\n\n\u0012\n\n10\u22124\n\u2206\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\n\u0013\nP\n\u03c4grow\ns\n0.1 s\n(10)\nwhere P = 2\u03c0/\u03a9p is the observed spin period (we associate the charged component with the crust, \u03a9p = \u03a9c ).\nWe see that this new instability can grow rapidly, on a\ntimescale comparable to the rotation period of the star.\nAlthough we cannot yet claim to understand the detailed nature of this new r-mode instability, we have some\nuseful clues. Firstly, we find from (8) that the unstable\nmodes are such that |An /Ap | \u223c xp . Thus, the fluid motion is predominantly in the proton fluid. There should\nalso be a close connection with the short wavelength instability that we recently discovered for precessing superfluid stars [17]. In that case, the result followed from a local plane-wave analysis of the inertial modes. An attempt\nto link these two results would be useful. Finally, since\nthe present system has two distinct rotation rates one\nmight expect the instability to belong to the general twostream class [16]. Such instabilities are generic in multifluid systems. The intuitive condition for such an instability dictates that the mode's pattern speed \u2212Re(\u03c3)/m\nP\n\u2248\n2\u03c0\n\n\f3\nshould lie between\n\u221a \u03a9n and \u03a9p [16] . This criterion translates into m > 2mc , which is satisfied in the main part\nof the parameter space where the instability is operative.\nIn order for the new instability to affect the dynamics\nof realistic neutron stars it must (at least) overcome viscous damping. For young and mature neutron stars, dissipation is dominated by shear viscosity due to electronelectron collisions [18]. For a uniform density star with\nM = 1.4M\u2299 and R = 10 km (the canonical values used\nin the following) the corresponding viscosity coefficient is\n[19]\n\u03b7ee \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 1020\n\n\u0010 x \u00113/2 \u0012 108 K \u00132\np\ng cm\u22121 s\u22121 (11)\n0.05\nT\n\nwhere T is the core temperature. We can use the standard energy-integral approach to estimate the viscous\ndamping timescale. In fact, since |An | \u226a |Ap | we can\nuse existing results for r-modes of uniform density stars\n[20], remembering that shear viscosity only acts on the\nproton fluid. Thus, a simple calculation leads to\n\u03c4sv\n\n6 \u00d7 104\n3M xp\n\u2248\n\u2248\n8\u03c0m2 \u03b7ee R\nm2\n\n\u0012\n\n0.05\nxp\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nT\n108 K\n\n\u00132\n\ns\n\n(12)\nCombining (10) and (12) we have a criterion for the unstable modes to grow fast enough to overcome viscous\ndamping.

Since the\ninstability sets in when m > mc we conclude that the\nsystem becomes unstable once it reaches the critical lag\n\u2206c \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22125\n\n\u0012\n\nP\n0.1 s\n\n\u00132/3 \u0012\n\nT\n108 K\n\n\u0013\u22124/3\n\n(14)\n\nMaking contact with observations.- Within a twocomponent model, it is straightforward to estimate the\ncritical lag required to explain the observations. Assuming that angular momentum is conserved in the process,\none must have Ic \u2206\u03a9c \u2248 \u2212Is \u2206\u03a9s , where Is and Ic are\nthe two moments of inertia, while \u2206\u03a9s and \u2206\u03a9c represent the changes in the corresponding spin frequencies. The glitch data suggests that about 2 % of the total\nspin-down is reversed in the glitches [21], suggesting that\nIs /Ic \u2248 0.02. In order to permit Vela-sized glitches with\n\u2206\u03a9c /\u03a9c \u223c 10\u22126 we then need (assuming \u03a9c = \u03a9s after\nthe event)\n\u2206g \u2248\n\nIc \u2206\u03a9c\n\u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\nIs \u03a9c\n\n(15)\n\nThe observational estimate of the lag \u2206g at which large\nglitches occur is close to our estimate (14) for the onset\n\nof the superfluid r-mode instability. This is unlikely to\nbe a coincidence. Even though it is difficult to compare\nthe parameters of our two-fluid neutron star model to\nthe global quantities used in the phenomenological discussion directly, it is clear that our new instability has\nthe features expected of a glitch trigger mechanism. It\noperates in the strong drag limit, where vortices are effectively pinned to the charged component. As long as\nthe system is stable, a rotational lag should build up as\nthe crust spins down. Once the system evolves beyond\nthe critical level (14) a range of unstable r-modes grow on\na timescale of a few rotation periods. We cannot yet say\nwhat happens when these modes reach large (non-linear)\namplitudes, but it seems inevitable that the fluid motion associated with the instability will break the vortex\npinning, allowing a glitch to proceed.\nLet us compare the \"predictions\" of our model to the\ndata for pulsars exhibiting large glitches. To do this, we\nestimate the maximum glitch size allowed if \u2206g = \u2206c ,\nassuming a completely relaxed system and Is /Ic = 0.02.\nSince we do not have temperature data for most glitching\npulsars we estimate T by combining the heat blanket\nmodel from [22] with a simple modified URCA cooling\nlaw. Calibrating this model to the Vela pulsar, for which\nT \u2248 6.9 \u00d7 107 K [23], we find\nT \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 10\n\n8\n\n\u0012\n\ntc\n1 yr\n\n\u0013\u22121/6\n\nK\n\n(16)\n\nHere tc = P/2\u1e56 is the characteristic pulsar age. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 1. This Figure shows that our\nmodel does well in predicting the maximum glitches one\nshould expect. The data is consistent with the idea that\na system needs to evolve into the instability region before a large glitch happens. It should be noted that,\neven though the instability first appears at m = mc , the\ngrowth time is much longer than (10) until m > 1.2mc\nor so. It is also interesting to note that two of the systems with actual temperature data [23], Vela and PSR\nB1706-44, both sit on the m \u2248 1.6mc curve.\nDiscussion. - We have described a new instability\nthat may operate in rotating superfluid neutron stars.\nWe have demonstrated that this instability sets in at\nparameter values that compare well with those inferred\nfrom pulsar glitches. This suggests that the superfluid\nr-mode instability may be the mechanism that triggers\nlarge pulsar glitches.\nThe model is consistent with a number of observed\nproperties of glitching pulsars:\ni) Adolescent pulsars, like Crab and PSR J0537-69,\nshould only exhibit small amplitude glitches. For fast\nspin and a relatively high temperature the instability sets\nin at smaller values of \u2206.\nii) More mature and slower spinning neutron stars\nhave colder cores which means they can produce larger\nglitches, provided the required \u2206 can build up (cf. PSR\n\n\f4\n-4\n\neters (P \u223c 10 s, T \u223c 109 K), we would not expect these\nobjects to exhibit large glitches. Yet, they do [2]. The\nresolution may be that these glitches involve a larger fraction Is /Ic . A very interesting question for the future concerns whether this is a natural consequence of stronger\nmagnetic pinning in the neutron star core.\n\n10\n\n2.5mc\nB2334+61\n\n1.6mc\nmc\n\n-5\n\n\u2206\u03a9c/\u03a9c\n\n10\n\nB1706-44\n\n1%\n\nVela\n\n0.5%\n\n-6\n\n10\n\nCrab\n-7\n\n10 0\n\n10\n\n5\n2/3\n\n8\n\n-4/3\n\n(P/0.1s) (T/10 K)\n\nFIG. 1: The maximum glitches predicted from (14) are compared to observations. The mc curve represents the onset of\nthe superfluid instability (the instability region is grey, and for\n2.5mc there is a range of unstable inertial modes) and a glitch\ninvolving the relaxation of 2% of the total moment of inertia\n(corresponding curves for 1% and 0.5% are also shown). The\ncircles are systems with temperature data (taken from [23]).\nThe triangles represent systems for which T is estimated using\n(16). The glitch-data is taken from [1, 25].\n\nJ1806-21 with \u2206\u03a9c /\u03a9c \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 [24]). Since \u2206c increases as the star ages one would expect neutron stars\nto cease to glitch eventually.\niii) For any glitch mechanism that relies on a critical spin\nlag between a superfluid component and the rest of the\nstar it is easy to estimate the time interval tg between\nsuccessive glitches. Assuming that each glitch relaxes\nthe system, we estimate tg \u2248 2\u2206g tc >\n\u223c 2\u2206c tc . For Vela\n750\nd\nwhich\ncompares\nwell with the obwe then find tg >\n\u223c\nserved averaged time of about 1000 d. The most regular\nknown glitcher, PSR J0537-69, has an average interglitch\ntime of about 120 d [25]. In the absence of temperature\ndata we use (16) for this object and find tg >\n\u223c 90 d. Again,\nthe agreement with the observations is good, and consistent with the notion that the system evolves into the\nunstable regime before a glitch occurs.\niv) There is no reason why the instability should not operate in all spinning neutron stars in which a rotational lag\nbuilds up. In particular, one may expect accreting neutron stars to \"glitch\" occasionally. So far, there has only\nbeen one suggested event, in the slowly rotating transient\nKS 1947+300 [3]. For this system our model suggests\n(combining P = 18.7 s with T \u2248 108 K, a temperature\nthat should be typical of an accreting star) a maximum\nglitch of \u2206\u03a9c /\u03a9c \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 . This is very close to the\nsuggested observed glitch with \u2206\u03a9c /\u03a9c \u2248 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 [3].\nSuch events should, of course, be extremely rare.\nSince we have considered the non-magnetic inertial\nmode problem, our model does not apply (without modification) to magnetars. It is nevertheless interesting to\nconsider these systems. Given typical magnetar param-\n\nThese first results are promising, but we are obviously far away from a complete understanding of this\nnew mechanism. Future work needs to consider more\ndetailed neutron star models. We need to understand\nthe local mutual friction parameters and the nature of\nvortex pinning. The inertial mode problem for realistic\nneutron star models presents a real challenge. We should\nalso make more detailed attempts at understanding the\nobservations. A natural first step would be to improve\non the temperature estimates used in Figure 1. Finally,\nwe need to understand the nonlinear development of the\nnew instability. This problem can perhaps be studied\nwith numerical simulations, building on the work discussed in [26]. Ultimately one would hope to arrive at a\ntruly quantitative model for pulsar glitches.\n\n[1] www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/\n[2] R. Dib, V.M. Kaspi and F.T. Gavriil, Ap.
