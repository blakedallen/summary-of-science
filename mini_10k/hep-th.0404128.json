O. Box 2735, Beijing 100080, China\nytian@itp.ac.cn\nSeptember 5, 2018\n\nAbstract\nWe have calculated the topological charge of U (N ) instantons on\nnon-degenerate noncommutative space time to be exactly the instanton\nnumber k in a previous paper [1]. This paper, which deals with the\ndegenerate R2NC \u00d7 R2 case, is the continuation of [1]. We find that the\nsame conclusion holds in this case, thus complete the answer to the\nproblem of topological charge of noncommutative U (N ) instantons.\n\n1\n\n\fIn a previous article [1], we have explicitly shown that the topological\ncharge of U (N ) instantons on non-degenerate noncommutative space time1\nR4NC is equal to the instanton number k, which appears in the noncommutative ADHM construction [6] as the dimension of the vector space V .\nThere we left the problem of degenerate noncommutative parameter \u03b8. We\nmentioned that our method ceased to work in the limit of \u03b82 \u2192 0 because\nof the loss of a Fock space representation for z2 and z\u03042 .2\nIn this degenerate limit, the noncommutative space time becomes a direct product R2NC \u00d7 R2 . It is well known that field theories on R4NC suffer\nfrom a common problem of non-unitarity. But the problem does not happen\non R2NC \u00d7 R2 if we require a time in the commutative part. For this reason,\nR2NC \u00d7 R2 may be of more physical relevance than R4NC . Literature has also\nshown that nonsingular ADHM instanton solutions can be constructed on\nR2NC \u00d7 R2 without involving any projected states [7, 8].\nIn the following paragraphs, we will analytically calculate the topological\ncharge of U (N ) instantons on R2NC \u00d7 R2 . As the continuation of [1], this\npaper will be brief about the relevant background and rely on some results\nin [1].\nFirst let us recall the commutator of complex coordinates:\n[z\u03041 , z1 ] = \u03b81 = \u03b6,\n\n[z\u03042 , z2 ] = \u03b82 = 0.\n\nNow we introduce a Fock space representation for z1 and z\u03041 :\np \u221a\n\u03b6 n + 1|n + 1i,\nz1 |ni =\np \u221a\n\u03b6 n|n \u2212 1i.\nz\u03041 |ni =\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThen the integration on R2NC \u00d7 R2 can be expressed as\nZ\n\nd4x O(x) = \u03b6\u03c0\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nn=0\n\nd2x hn|O(x)|ni,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere d2x = dx3 dx4 [8].\nUsing the Corrigan's identity [9], we have the following expression of\ntopological charge of (ASD) ADHM instanton on R2NC \u00d7 R2 with instanton\nnumber k [1]:\nQ =\n1\n2\n\n1\n16\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nd4x TrN (Fmn Fmn )\n\nFor noncommutative geometry and field theory, please see [2, 3, 4, 5].\nHere we follow the notation of [1].\n\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\f=\n=\n\n1\nd4x (8\u2202 \u2202 \u0304 + 2\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc )Tr[b\u2020 (2 \u2212 \u2206f \u2206\u2020 )bf ]\n16\u03c0 2\n\u221e Z\n1\n1\n\u03b6 X\nd2x hn|( \u2202 \u2202 \u0304 + \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc )Tr[(2 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 f \u2206\u2032\u2020)f ]|ni,\n\u03c0 n=0\n2\n8\nZ\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2202 \u2261 \u2202z1 , \u2202 \u0304 \u2261 \u2202z\u03041 , \u03bc = 3, 4, and \u2206\u2032 \u2261 b\u2020 \u2206 [10].\nSimilarly as in [1], we have the truncated summation\nN\nX\n\n \u0304\nhn|\u2202 \u2202O(x)|ni\n=\n\nn=0\n\nN +1\n(hN + 1|O|N + 1i \u2212 hN |O|N i),\n\u03b6\n\n(8)\n\nusing the Stokes-like theorem. Let\nO = (2 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 f \u2206\u2032\u2020 )f\n\n(9)\n\nagain as in [1], we have for large N\nhN |O|N i = (\u03b6N + x\u03bc x\u03bc )\u22121 + (\u03b6N + x\u03bc x\u03bc )\u22122 C + O(N \u22123 ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere C is some constant 2k \u00d7 2k matrix.3 So\nhN + 1|O|N + 1i \u2212 hN |O|N i =\n\n(\u03b6N +\n\n\u2212\u03b6\n\nx\u03bc x\u03bc )[\u03b6(N\n\n+ 1) + x\u03bc x\u03bc ]\n\n+ O(N \u22123 ).\n(11)\n\nThus we obtain one part of the topological charge\nQ1 =\n\n\u03b6\nlim Tr\n2\u03c0 N \u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndx\n\nN\nX\n\n \u0304 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 f \u2206\u2032\u2020 )f ]|ni\nhn|\u2202 \u2202[(2\n\n(12)\n\nn=0\n\n\u2212\u03b6\nlim Tr[N\n=\n2\u03c0 N \u2192\u221e\n= \u2212k.\n\nZ\n\nd2x (\u03b6N + x\u03bc x\u03bc )\u22122 + O(N \u22122 )]\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nNoting that O is an ordinary function (matrix) in x3,4 and a bounded\noperator [1] on the Fock space, we immediately work out the other part of\nthe topological charge\nQ2 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b6\nTr\nhn|\n8\u03c0 n=0\n\nZ\n\nd2x \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc [(2 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 f \u2206\u2032\u2020)f ]|ni = 0,\n\n(15)\n\n3\nThe non-singularity of each term for arbitrary x3,4 in the summation (8) can be\nanalyzed by the same method as in the appendix of [1].\n\n3\n\n\fwhere we have used the Stokes theorem and the following asymptotic as\n|x3,4 | \u2192 \u221e:\n1\nf \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc.\n(16)\nx x\nIn conclusion, we obtain the topological charge\nQ = Q1 + Q2 = \u2212k,\n\n(17)\n\nwhich is expected for an ASD instanton configuration. For an SD instanton\non R2NC \u00d7 R2 with instanton number k, we can similarly have\nQ = k,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich completes the answer to the problem of topological charge of noncommutative U (N ) instantons.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Dr. Jian Dai, Prof. Chuan-Jie Zhu and Prof. XingChang Song for helpful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y.
