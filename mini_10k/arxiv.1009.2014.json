We find bounds on the Hilbert space compression of the limit of a directed metric\nsystem of groups. We also give estimates on the Hilbert space compression of group extensions\nof a group H by a a word-hyperbolic group or a group of polynomial growth.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn [5], Gromov introduced the notion of uniform embeddability of a finitely generated group\ninto a Hilbert space and suggested that such a group would satisfy the Novikov Conjecture [6]. Six\nyears later, Yu came up with a formal proof of this claim [13]. Moreover, together with Skandalis\nand Tu, he proved that such uniformly embeddable groups also satisfy the coarse Baum-Connes\nConjecture [10].\nDefinition 1.1. A metric space (X, d) is uniformly embeddable in a Hilbert space, if there exist\na Hilbert space H, non-decreasing functions \u03c1\u2212 , \u03c1+ : R+ \u2192 R+ such that limt\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u2212 (t) = +\u221e,\nand a map f : X \u2192 H, such that\n\u03c1\u2212 (d(x, y)) \u2264 d(f (x), f (y)) \u2264 \u03c1+ (d(x, y)) \u2200x, y \u2208 X.\n\nThe map f is called a uniform embedding of X in H. It is called large-scale Lipschitz whenever\n\u03c1+ can be taken of the form \u03c1+ : t 7\u2192 Ct + D for some C > 0, D \u2265 0. It is Lipschitz if we can\ntake D = 0.\nTwo length functions l1 and l2 on a group (see Definition 2.1) are coarsely equivalent if for every\nR > 0 there exists S > 0 such that the l1 -ball B(1, R) with radius R and center 1 is contained\nin the l2 -ball B(1, S); and conversely. Clearly in this case, (X, l1 ) is uniformly embeddable if and\nonly if (X, l2 ) is uniformly embeddable. Lemma 2.1 in [12] shows that every discrete countable\ngroup X admits a unique proper length function up to coarse equivalence, enabling us to define\nthe concept of discrete countable uniformly embeddable group. This class of groups and its\npermanence properties have been very well studied, for example by Guentner and Dadarlat in [3].\nFor our purposes and theirs, the following reformulation of their Proposition 2.1, which holds for\nany metric space, is vital.\nProposition 1.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then X is uniformly embeddable in a Hilbert space\nif and only if for every n > 0 there exist Sn > 0 and a Hilbert space valued map \u03ben : X \u2192 H, x \u2192 \u03benx\nsuch that k \u03benx k= 1 for all x \u2208 X and such that\n\u221a\n\u2032\n(1) k \u03benx \u2212 \u03benx k\u2264 n1 provided d(x, x\u2032 ) \u2264 n,\n\u2032\n(2) k \u03benx \u2212 \u03benx k\u2265 1 provided d(x, x\u2032 ) \u2265 Sn .\nThe speed at which (Sn )n\u2208N0 tends to infinity is an indication on how uniformly embeddable a\nmetric space really is. For example, if n 7\u2192 Sn is bounded by a polynomial map in n, it would make\nsense to say that the corresponding space is more uniformly embeddable than a space for which\nn 7\u2192 Sn is only bounded by an exponential map in n. Another, more standard way of describing\nhow uniformly embeddable a metric space X really is, is by looking at the supremum of \u03b4 \u2265 0 such\nthat there is a large-scale Lipschitz uniform embedding of X and numbers C \u2032 , D\u2032 > 0 such that\n\u03c1\u2212 in Definition 1.1 can be taken of the from r 7\u2192 C1\u2032 r\u03b4 \u2212 D\u2032 . This supremum is called the Hilbert\nThe author is a research assistant for the Research Foundation - Flanders.\n1\n\n\fHILBERT SPACE COMPRESSION UNDER DIRECT LIMITS AND CERTAIN GROUP EXTENSIONS\n\n2\n\nspace compression of X [7]. For X a group, it must be noted that Hilbert space compression is\na quasi-isometric invariant, but no longer a coarse invariant. Therefore, it is important that we\nalways specify the chosen length function.\nLooking closely at the proof of Proposition 1.2, one finds a connection between the Hilbert\nspace compression of a metric space and the growth of the sequence (Sn )n\u2208N0 . In this note, we try\nroughly to exploit this connection and then use techniques from [3] to get concrete information\nabout the behaviour of the Hilbert space compression of groups under taking direct limits and\nunder taking certain group extensions. Regarding group extensions, we prove the following results\nin Section 3 (see Theorems 3.3 and 3.5).\nTheorem 1.3. Assume that \u0393 is a group, equipped with some length function l = l\u0393 , that fits in\na short exact sequence\n\u03c0\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 G \u2192 1.\nDefine a length function lG on G by setting lG (\u03c0(x)) = inf{l(y) | \u03c0(y) = \u03c0(x)}. If G with\nthe induced metric from \u0393 has polynomial growth and if H with the induced metric from \u0393 has\ncompression \u03b4, then the compression of \u0393 is at least \u03b4/4.\nTheorem 1.4. Assume that \u0393 is a finitely generated group, equipped with the word length function\nl = l\u0393 relative to some finite symmetric generating subset S and that it fits in a short exact sequence\n\u03c0\n\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 G \u2192 1.\n\nEquip G with the word length function lG relative to \u03c0(S). If G is a finitely generated hyperbolic\ngroup in the sense of Gromov [4] and if H, with the induced metric from \u0393, has Hilbert space\ncompression \u03b4, then the Hilbert space compression of \u0393 is at least \u03b4/5.\nWe assume that every metric space in this article is a group and we assume that the metric is\ninduced by a length function.\n2. Hilbert space compression for the limit of a directed system of groups\nThroughout this article, every metric space will be a group whose metric is induced by a length\nfunction. Let us start by recalling the definition of a length function on a group.\nDefinition 2.1. A length function l on a group G is a function l : G \u2192 R+ satisfying\n(1) l(x) = 0 \u21d4 x = 1,\n(2) \u2200x \u2208 G, l(x) = l(x\u22121 ),\n(3) \u2200x, y \u2208 G, l(xy) \u2264 l(x) + l(y).\nWe say that l is proper, whenever\n\u2200M \u2208 R+ : | {g \u2208 G | l(g) \u2264 M } |< \u221e.\n\nEvery length function on G induces a left-invariant metric on G by d(x, y) = l(x\u22121 y) \u2200x, y \u2208 G.\nLet G1 \u2192 G2 \u2192 G3 \u2192 . . . be a directed system of groups such that the maps Gi \u2192 Gi+1 are\nisometric injections. Denote G the direct limit of this system. By definition, G can be seen as\nthe disjoint union of all the Gi divided by some equivalence relation. Define the induced length\nfunction l on G by l(x) := limi lGi (x). We proceed under the assumption that l is a proper length\nfunction on G. In this section, we ask ourselves the question how the Hilbert space compression\nof G, denoted by \u03b1(G), is related to the Hilbert space compressions of the Gi .\nTo begin, notice that every Gi can be seen as a metric subspace of G and so \u03b1(G) \u2264 inf i\u2208N \u03b1(Gi ).\nClearly, this bound is sharp, since as a family of subgroups we can take Gi = G (\u2200i \u2208 N). It proves\nmore challenging to find a good lower bound for \u03b1(G). First, note that the same bound as above,\ni.e. inf i\u2208I \u03b1(Gi ), is not always a lower bound. As an example, equip the group\nZ(Z) = {f : Z \u2192 Z with finite support} = {(f, a) \u2208 Z \u2240 Z | a = 0}\n\nwith the induced metric from Z \u2240 Z. This group is the direct limit of the family of subgroups\nGn := Z2n+1 = {f : [\u2212n, n] \u2192 Z}, where each Z2n+1 is equipped with the subspace metric from\n\n\fHILBERT SPACE COMPRESSION UNDER DIRECT LIMITS AND CERTAIN GROUP EXTENSIONS\n\n3\n\nZ(Z) . Since this metric is quasi-isometric to the standard word length metric on Z2n+1 , we obtain\nZ(Z) as a limit of groups with compression 1. However, it follows from the proof of Theorem 3.9\nin [1] that Z(Z) has compression less than 43 .\nNotice moreover that Z and Z(Z) have different compressions although they are both limits of\ngroups of compression 1. It will thus be necessary to include more information on how the groups\nGi are embedded in their respective Hilbert spaces in order to say something useful about the\nHilbert space compression of their limit.\nWe propose the following\nTheorem 2.2. Assume that G is the direct limit of a directed metric system (Gi )i\u2208N of groups\nand that the induced length function l is proper. If inf i\u2208N (\u03b1(Gi )) = 0, then \u03b1(G) = 0.\nElse, choose 0 < \u03b4 < inf i\u2208N \u03b1(Gi ) and choose for every i \u2208 N, a Hilbert space Hi , constants\nfi , Di , D\nfi \u2265 0 and a map\nCi > 0, C\nfi : Gi \u2192 Hi\nsatisfying\n\nfi d(x, y) + D\nfi \u2200x, y \u2208 Gi .\n(1/Ci ) d(x, y)\u03b4 \u2212 Di \u2264 d(fi (x), fi (y)) \u2264 C\n\u221a\nDenote g : N \u2192 N such that for all x \u2208 G we have x \u2208 Gg(n) whenever l(x) \u2264 n. Then,\n\u03b1(G) \u2265 lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(\u03b4/2) ln(n \u2212 1)\n.\np\n\u221a\n^\nln(Cg(n) 2 ln(2)n(C]\nn+D\ng(n)\ng(n) ) + Cg(n) Dg(n) )\n\nExample 2.3. Assume that G is an infinite direct sum of finite groups G = F0 \u2295 F1 \u2295 F2 \u2295 . . .\nwhere F0 = {1}. We can equip G with a proper length function by setting l(g) = min{n \u2208 N |\ng \u2208 \u2295ni=0 Fi }. Clearly, then G is a directed system of metric spaces as above. Recalling the fact\nthat finite groups have Hilbert space compression equal to 1, we can apply Theorem 2.2, obtaining\n\u03b1(G) = 1.\nExample 2.4. Let G \u2240 H be finitely generated and equip it with the word length metric relative\nto a finite symmetric generating subset. Theorem 2.2 can be used as an easy way to estimate the\ncompressions of spaces G(H) := {f : H \u2192 G | f has finite support }, equipped with the induced\nlength function from G \u2240 H. If G is a discrete group with compression \u03b1 and H has polynomial\n2\u03b1\ngrowth of order d, then we obtain the lower bound d+4\n. It must be mentioned that the so obtained\nlower bound is weaker than the lower bound obtained in [8].\nProposition 1.2 from the Introduction plays a very important role in our proofs. It is implied by\nthe following Proposition, which is Proposition 2.1 of [3]. We will give a (slightly modified version\nof) Guentner and Dadarlat's proof here because the details will be of vital importance further on.\nProposition 2.5. Let X be a metric space. Then X is uniformly embeddable in a Hilbert space if\nand only if for every R > 0 and \u01eb > 0 there exists a Hilbert space valued map \u03be : X \u2192 H, x \u2192 \u03bex\nsuch that k \u03bex k= 1 for all x \u2208 X and such that\n(1) sup{k \u03bex \u2212 \u03bex\u2032 k: d(x, x\u2032 ) \u2264 R, x, x\u2032 \u2208 X} \u2264 \u01eb,\n\u221a\n(2) limS\u2192\u221e inf{k \u03bex \u2212 \u03bex\u2032 k: d(x, x\u2032 ) \u2265 S, x, x\u2032 \u2208 X} = 2.\nProof. Assume that X is uniformly embeddable and let F : X \u2192 H be a uniform embedding of\nX in a real Hilbert space H. Let \u03c1\u2212 and \u03c1+ be functions such that\n\u03c1\u2212 (d(x, y)) \u2264k F (x) \u2212 F (y) k\u2264 \u03c1+ (d(x, y)).\nDenote\nExp(H) = R \u2295 H \u2295 (H \u2297 H) \u2295 (H \u2297 H \u2297 H) \u2295 * * *\n\nand define Exp : H \u2192 Exp(H) by\n\n1\n1\nExp(\u03b6) = 1 \u2295 \u03b6 \u2295 ( \u221a \u03b6 \u2297 \u03b6) \u2295 ( \u221a \u03b6 \u2297 \u03b6 \u2297 \u03b6) \u2295 * * * .\n2!\n3!\n\n\fHILBERT SPACE COMPRESSION UNDER DIRECT LIMITS AND CERTAIN GROUP EXTENSIONS\n\n4\n\n\u2032\n\nNote that hExp(\u03b6), Exp(\u03b6 \u2032 )i = eh\u03b6,\u03b6 i , for all \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 \u2208 H.

Denote the second bounded cohomology group of G, defined using bounded cocycles, by\nH 2 (G, H). By [9], the comparison map\nHb2 (G, H) \u2192 H 2 (G, H),\nis onto for G hyperbolic, i.e. every 2-cocycle has a bounded representative.\nNow, let s : G \u2192 \u0393 be a (set-theoretic) section, i.e. p \u25e6 s = IdG and define\nc(x, y) = s(xy)\u22121 s(x)s(y) \u2200x, y \u2208 G.\nBy the above, we can assume that c is bounded and so Gersten's result implies that \u0393 is quasiisometric to G \u00d7 H. Consequently, the compression of \u0393 equals the minimum of the compressions\nof G and H [7], which is 1 (see [11], [2]).\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Alain Valette for reading previous versions of this article, for introducing me into the world\nof Hilbert space compression, for encouragements and for pointing out the result formulated in\nTheorem 3.6.
