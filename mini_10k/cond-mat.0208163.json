Here we provide an exact result showing that a scale-free connectivity distribution with\ndiverging second moment is a sufficient condition to have null epidemic threshold in unstructured\nnetworks with either assortative or dissortative mixing.

The present result is\nrelated to the divergence of the average nearest neighbors connectivity, enforced by the connectivity\ndetailed balance condition.\nPACS numbers: 89.75.-k, 87.23.Ge, 05.70.Ln\n\nComplex networks play a capital role in the modeling of many social, natural, and technological systems\nwhich are characterized by peculiar topological properties [1, 2]. In particular, small-world properties [3] and\nscale-free connectivity distributions [4] appear as common features of many real-world networks. The statistical physics approach has been proved a very valuable\ntool for the study of these networks, and several surprising results concerning dynamical processes taking place\non complex networks have been repeatedly reported. In\nparticular, the absence of the percolation [5, 6] and epidemic [7, 8, 9, 10] thresholds in scale-free (SF) networks\nhas hit the community because of its potential practical\nimplications. The absence of the percolative threshold,\nindeed, prompts to an exceptional tolerance to random\ndamages [11]. On the other hand, the lack of any epidemic threshold makes SF networks the ideal media for\nthe propagation of infections, bugs, or unsolicited informations [7].\nRecent studies have focused in a more detailed topological characterization of several social and technological\nnetworks. In particular, it has been recognized that many\nof these networks possess, along with SF properties, nontrivial connectivity correlations [12]. For instance, many\nsocial networks show that nodes with high connectivity\nwill connect more preferably to highly connected nodes\n[12]; a property referred to as \"assortative mixing\". On\nthe opposite side, many technological and biological networks show \"dissortative mixing\"; i.e. highly connected\nnodes are preferably connected to nodes with low connectivity [13, 14, 15]. Correlations are very important\nin determining the physical properties of these networks\n[16] and several recent works are addressing the effect of\n\"dissortative mixing\" correlations in epidemic spreading\n[17, 18, 19]. The fact that highly connected nodes (hubs)\nare more likely to transmit the infection to poorly connected nodes could somehow slow down the spreading\nprocess. By numerical simulations and analytical arguments it has been claimed that, if strong enough, connec-\n\ntivity correlations might reintroduce an epidemic threshold in SF networks, thus restoring the standard tolerance\nto infections.\nIn this paper we analyze in detail the conditions for the\nlack of an epidemic threshold in the susceptible-infectedsusceptible model [20] in SF networks. We find the exact\nresult that a SF connectivity distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3\nwith 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3 in unstructured networks with assortative or dissortative mixing is a sufficient condition for a\nnull epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit. In\nother words, the presence of two-point connectivity correlations does not alter the extreme weakness of SF networks to epidemic diffusion. This result is related to the\ndivergence of the nearest neighbors average connectivity,\ndivergence that is ensured by the connectivity detailed\nbalance condition, to be satisfied in physical networks.\nThe present analysis can be easily generalized to more\nsophisticated epidemic models.\nIn the following we shall consider unstructured undirected SF networks, in which the only relevant property\nof the nodes is their connectivity [21], with distribution\nP (k) \u223c Ck \u2212\u03b3 , with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3. P (k) is defined as the\nprobability that a randomly selected node has k connections to other nodes. In this case the network has unbounded connectivity fluctuations, signalled by a diverging second moment k 2 \u2192 \u221e in the thermodynamic\nlimit kc \u2192 \u221e, where kc is the maximum connectivity of\nthe network. It is worth recalling that in growing networks kc is related to the network size N as kc \u223c N 1/(\u03b3\u22121)\n[2]. Finally, we shall consider that the network presents\nassortative or dissortative mixing allowing for non trivial two-point connectivity correlations. This corresponds\nto allow a general form for the conditional probability,\nP (k \u2032 | k), that a link emanated by a node of connectivity\nk points to a node of connectivity k \u2032 .\nAs a prototypical example for examining the properties of epidemic dynamics in SF networks we consider\nthe susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model [20], in\nwhich each node represents an individual of the popu-\n\n\f2\nlation and the links represent the physical interactions\namong which the infection propagates. Each individual\ncan be either in a susceptible or infected state. Susceptible individuals become infected with probability \u03bb if at\nleast one of the neighbors is infected. Infected nodes,\non the other hand, recover and become susceptible again\nwith probability one. A different recovery probability can\nbe considered by a proper rescaling of \u03bb and the time.\nThis model is conceived for representing endemic infections which do not confer permanent immunity, allowing\nindividuals to go through the stochastic cycle susceptible \u2192 infected \u2192 susceptible by contracting the infection\nover and over again. In regular homogeneous networks,\nin which each node has more or less the same number of\nconnections, k \u2243 hki, it is possible to understand the behavior of the model by looking at the average density of\ninfected individuals \u03c1(t) (the prevalence). It is found that\nfor a spreading probability \u03bb \u2265 \u03bbc , where \u03bbc is the epidemic threshold depending on the network average connectivity and topology, the system reaches an endemic\nstate with a finite stationary density \u03c1. If \u03bb \u2264 \u03bbc , the\nsystem falls in a finite time in a healthy state with no\ninfected individuals (\u03c1 = 0).\nIn SF networks the average connectivity is highly fluctuating and the approximation k \u2243 hki is totally inadequate. To take into account the effect of the connectivity\nfluctuations, it has been shown that it is appropriate to\nconsider the quantity \u03c1k [7, 8, 16], defined as the density\nof infected nodes within each connectivity class k. This\ndescription assumes that the network is unstructured and\nthat the classification of nodes according only to their\nconnectivity is meaningful [21]. Following Ref. [16], the\nmean-field rate equations describing the system can be\nwritten as\nX\nd\u03c1k (t)\nP (k \u2032 | k)\u03c1k\u2032 (t). (1)\n= \u2212\u03c1k (t) + \u03bbk [1 \u2212 \u03c1k (t)]\ndt\n\u2032\nk\n\nThe first term on the r.h.s. represents the annihilation\nof infected individuals due to recovery with unitary rate.\nThe creation term is proportional to the density of susceptible individuals, 1 \u2212 \u03c1k , times the spreading rate,\n\u03bb, the number of neighboring nodes, k, and the probability that any neighboring node is infected. The latter is the average over all connectivities of the probability P (k \u2032 | k)\u03c1k\u2032 that a link emanated from a node\nwith connectivity k points to an infected node with connectivity k \u2032 . It is worth remarking that, while keeping\ninto account the two point connectivity correlations, as\ngiven by the conditional probability P (k \u2032 | k), yet we have\nneglected higher order density-density and connectivity\ncorrelations. Eq. (1) is therefore exact for the class of\nMarkovian networks [16], in the limit of low prevalence\n(\u03c1(t) \u226a 1).\nIn the case of uncorrelated networks each link points,\nwith probability proportional to k \u2032 P (k \u2032 ), to a node of\n\nconnectivity k \u2032 , regardless of the emanating node's connectivity.\nIn this case, in the stationary state (\u2202t \u03c1 =\nP\n\u2032\nP\n(k\n| k)\u03c1k\u2032 (t) assumes a constant value inde0),\n\u2032\nk\npendent on k and t and the system (1) can be solved\nself-consistently obtaining that the epidemic threshold is\ngiven by [10]\n\u03bbc =\n\nhki\n.\nhk 2 i\n\n(2)\n\nFor infinite SF networks with \u03b3 \u2264 3, we have k 2 =\n\u221e, and correspondingly \u03bbc = 0; i.e. uncorrelated SF\nnetworks allow a finite prevalence whatever the spreading\nrate \u03bb of the infection. Finally, from the solution of \u03c1k ,\none can\nP compute the total prevalence \u03c1 using the relation\n\u03c1 = k P (k)\u03c1k .\nIn the case of correlated networks the explicit solution\nof Eq. (1) is not generally accessible. However, it has\nbeen shown that the epidemic threshold is given by [16]\n\u03bbc =\n\n1\n,\n\u039bm\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u039bm is the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity\nmatrix C, defined by Ckk\u2032 = kP (k \u2032 | k). In Ref. [16] it\nhas been shown how this general formalism recovers previous results for uncorrelated networks, obtaining that,\nin this case, \u039bm = k 2 / hki. More generally, by looking\nat Eq. (3), the absence of an epidemic threshold corresponds to a divergence of the largest eigenvalue of the\nconnectivity matrix C in the limit of an infinite network\nsize N \u2192 \u221e. In order to provide some general statement on the conditions for such a divergence we can make\nuse of the Frobenius theorem for non-negative irreducible\nmatrices [22]. This theorem states the existence of the\nlargest eigenvalue of any non-negative irreducible matrix,\neigenvalue which is simple, positive, and has a positive\neigenvector. One of the consequences of the theorem is\nthat it provides a bound to such largest eigenvalue [23].\nIn our case the matrix of interest is the connectivity matrix and, since C is non-negative and irreducible [24], it\nis possible to find lower and upper bounds of \u039bm . In\nparticular, we can write [23]\nXX\n\u039b2m \u2265 min\nk \u2032 lP (l | k)P (k \u2032 | l).\n(4)\nk\n\nk\u2032\n\nl\n\nThis inequality relates the lower bound of the largest\neigenvalue \u039bm to the connectivity correlation function\nand, as we shall see, allows to find a sufficient condition\nfor the absence of the epidemic threshold.\nIn order to provide an explicit bound to the largest\neigenvalue we must exploit the properties of the conditional probability P (k \u2032 | k). A key relation holding for all\nphysical networks is that all links must point from one\nnode to another. This is translated in the connectivity\ndetailed balance condition [16]\nkP (k \u2032 | k)P (k) = k \u2032 P (k | k \u2032 )P (k \u2032 ),\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nwhich states that the total number of links pointing from\nnodes with connectivity k to nodes of connectivity k \u2032\nmust be equal to the total number of links that point\nfrom nodes with connectivity k \u2032 to nodes of connectivity k. This relation is extremely important since it constraints the possible form of the conditional probability\nP (k \u2032 | k) once P (k) is given. By multiplying by a k factor both terms of Eq. (5) and summing over k \u2032 and k, we\nobtain\nX\nX\nk2 =\nk \u2032 P (k \u2032 )\nkP (k | k \u2032 ),\n(6)\nk\u2032\n\nk\n\nwhere\nwe have\nused the normalization conditions\nP\nP\nP\n(k \u2032 | k) = 1. The term k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) =\nP\n(k)\n=\n\u2032\nk\nPk\n\u2032\nk kP (k | k ) defines the average nearest neighbor connectivity (ANNC) of nodes of connectivity k \u2032 . This is\na quantity customarily measured in SF and complex\nnetworks in order to quantify degree-degree correlations\n[13, 14, 15]. The dependence on kc is originated by the\nupper cut-off of the k-sum and it must be taken into account since it is a possible source of divergences in the\nthermodynamic limit. In SF networks with 2 < \u03b3 < 3\nwe have that the second moment of the connectivity distribution diverges as k 2 \u223c kc3\u2212\u03b3 [25]. We thus obtain\nthat\nX\nk\u2032\n\nk \u2032 P (k \u2032 )k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) \u2243\n\nC\nk 3\u2212\u03b3 .\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3) c\n\n(7)\n\nIn the case of dissortative mixing [12], the function\nk nn (k \u2032 , kc ) is decreasing with k \u2032 and, since k \u2032 P (k \u2032 ) is an\nintegrable function, the l.h.s. of Eq. (7) has no divergence related to the sum over k \u2032 . This implies that the\ndivergence must be contained in the kc dependence of\nk nn (k \u2032 , kc ). In other words, the function k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) \u2192 \u221e\nfor kc \u2192 \u221e in a non-zero measure set. In the case of assortative mixing, knn (k \u2032 , kc ) is an increasing function of\nk \u2032 and, depending on its rate of growth, there may be singularities associated to the sum over k \u2032 . Therefore, this\ncase has to be analyzed in detail. Let us assume that\nthe ANNC grows as k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) \u2243 \u03b1k \u2032\u03b2 , \u03b2 > 0, when\nk \u2032 \u2192 \u221e. If \u03b2 < \u03b3 \u2212 2, again there is no singularity related to the sum over k \u2032 and the previous argument for\ndissortative mixing holds. When \u03b3 \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03b2 < 1 there\nis a singularity coming from the sum over k \u2032 of the type\n\u03b2\u2212(\u03b3\u22122)\n. However, since Eq. (7) comes from an iden\u03b1kc\ntity, the singularity on the l.h.s. must match both the\nexponent of kc and the prefactor on the r.h.s. In the case\n\u03b3 \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03b2 < 1, the singularity coming from the sum is\nnot strong enough to match the r.h.s. of Eq. (7) since\n\u03b2 \u2212 (\u03b3 \u2212 2) < 3 \u2212 \u03b3. Thus, the function k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) must\nalso diverge when kc \u2192 \u221e in a non-zero measure set. Finally, when \u03b2 > 1 the singularity associated to the sum\nis too strong, forcing the prefactor to scale as \u03b1 \u2243 rkc1\u2212\u03b2\nand the ANNC as knn (k \u2032 , kc ) \u2243 rkc1\u2212\u03b2 k \u2032\u03b2 . It is easy to\nrealize that r \u2264 1, since the ANNC cannot be larger than\n\nkc . Plugging the k nn (k \u2032 , kc ) dependence into Eq. (7) and\nsimplifying common factors, we obtain the identity at the\nlevel of prefactors\n1\nr\n=\n.\n2\u2212\u03b3+\u03b2\n3\u2212\u03b3\n\n(8)\n\nSince \u03b2 > 1 and r < 1, the prefactor in the l.h.s. of\nEq. (8) is smaller than the one of the r.h.s. This fact\nimplies that the tail of the distribution in the l.h.s. of\nEq. (7) cannot account for the whole divergence of its\nr.h.s. This means that the sum is not the only source of\ndivergences and, therefore, the ANNC must diverge at\nsome other point [26].\nThe large kc behavior of the ANNC can be plugged in\nEq. (4) obtaining that\nX\n(9)\nlP (l | k)knn (l, kc )\n\u039b2m \u2265 min\nk\n\nl\n\nThe r.h.s. of this equation is a sum of positive terms and\ndiverges with kc at least as k nn (l, kc ) both in the dissortative or assortative cases [27]. This readily implies that\n\u039bm \u2265 \u221e for all networks with diverging k 2 . Finally\nEq. (3) yields that the epidemic threshold vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit in all SF networks with assortative\nand dissortative mixing if the connectivity distribution\nhas a diverging second moment; i.e. a SF connectivity distribution with exponent 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3 is a sufficient\ncondition for the absence of an epidemic threshold in unstructured networks with arbitrary two-point connectivity\ncorrelation function.\nIn physical terms, the absence of the epidemic threshold is related to the divergence of the average nearest\nneighbors connectivity k nn N in SF networks. This\nfunction is defined by\nX\nk nn N =\nP (k)k nn (k, kc ),\n(10)\nk\n\nwhere we have explicitly considered kc as a growing function of the network size N . By using the analysis shown\npreviously it follows that k nn N \u2192 \u221e when N \u2192 \u221e.\nIn SF networks this parameter takes into account the\nlevel of connectivity fluctuations and appears as ruling\nthe epidemic spreading dynamics. Somehow the number\nof neighbors that can be infected in successive steps is\nthe relevant quantity. Only in homogeneous networks,\nwhere knn N \u2243 hki, the epidemic spreading properties\ncan be related to the average connectivity. Noticeably,\nthe power-law behavior of SF networks imposes a divergence of k nn N independently of the level of correlations\npresent in the network. This amounts to lower to zero\nthe epidemic threshold. On the practical side, connectivity correlation functions can be measured in several\nnetworks and show assortative or dissortative behavior\ndepending on the system. These measurements are always performed in the presence of a finite kc that allows\n\n\f4\nthe regularization of the function k nn (k, kc ). The most\nconvenient way to exploit the infinite size singularity is\nto measure the average nearest neighbor connectivity for\nincreasing network sizes. All SF networks with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3\nmust present a diverging k nn N for N \u2192 \u221e. This statement is independent of the structure of the correlations\npresent in the networks.\nIt is worth stressing that the divergence of k nn N is\nensured by the connectivity detailed balance condition\nalone. Thus it is a very general results holding for all\nSF networks with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3. On the contrary, the SF\nbehavior with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3 is a necessary condition for the\nlack of epidemic threshold only in networks with general two-point connectivity correlations and in absence\nof higher-order correlations. The reason is that the relation between the epidemic threshold and the maximum\neigenvalue of the connectivity matrix only holds for these\nclasses of networks. Higher order correlations, or the\npresence of an underlying metric in the network [21], can\nmodify the rate equation at the basis of the SIS model\nand may invalidate the present discussion.\nThis work has been partially supported by the European commission FET Open project COSIN IST-200133555.

II\n(Chelsea Publishing Company, New York, 1974).\nFrom the Frobenius theorem [22] it can be proved that\nthe maximum eigenvalue, \u039bm , of any non-negative irreducible P\nmatrix, Akk\u2032 , satisfies the inequality \u039bm \u2265\n1\nmink \u03c8(k)\nAkk\u2032 \u03c8(k\u2032 ), where \u03c8(k) is any positive veck\u2032\ntor. By setting A = C2 and \u03c8(k) = k we recover the\ninequality of Eq. (4).\nThe irreducible property of the connectivity matrix is a\nsimple consequence of the fact that all the connectivity\nclasses in the network are accessible. That is, starting\nfrom the connectivity class k it is always possible to find\na path of links that connects this class to any other class\nk\u2032 of the network. If this is not the case it means that the\nnetwork is built up of disconnected irreducible subnetworks and, therefore, we can apply the same line of reasoning to each subnetwork. Notice that being irreducible\nis not equivalent to being fully connected at the node to\nnode level, but at the class to class level.\nFor \u03b3 = 3 the second moment diverges as k2 \u223c ln kc\nbut the argument, though more involved, is still valid.\nThe case \u03b2 = 1, that is, knn (k\u2032 , kc ) \u223c \u03b1k\u2032 when k\u2032 \u2192 \u221e,\nis rather pathological because is the only case where the\nANNC can be a non diverging function. If \u03b1 < 1, Eq. (7)\nimplies that it must exist at least one diverging point\nout of the one coming from the sum over k\u2032 and the discussion made in the text is valid. However, when \u03b1 = 1\nthis divergence is enough to fulfill the identity (7) and\nk nn (k, kc ) can be a convergent function when kc \u2192 \u221e.\nEven in this pathological situation it is possible to prove\nthat the maximum eigenvalue diverges in the thermodynamic limit. In order to do so the argumentation is to\nbe translated to the second moment of the nearest neighbor's connectivity. Since the inequality hx2 i \u2265 hxi2 is\ntrue for any random variable, the function k2 nn (k, kc ) is\neither \u223c k\u20322 , in which case the maximum eigenvalue is\ntrivially \u221e, or the probability P (k\u2032 | k) approaches to SF\ndistribution when kc \u2192 \u221e and \u039bm diverges as well.\nOne may argue that, since we are calculating a minimum\nfor k, if the transition probability P (l | k0 ) is zero at some\npoint k0 , this minimum is zero. In this case it is possible to show that repeating the same argument with C3\ninstead of C2 provides us an inequality that avoids this\nproblem.\n\n\f"}
