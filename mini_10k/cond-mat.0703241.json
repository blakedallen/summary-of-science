The Boron doping was performed using the Focus Ion Beam technique\non a Silicon wafer with nominal resistivity of 61 \u03a9.cm.

The qualitative spatial-resolution in sheet resistance imaging contrast is no worse than\n100 nm as estimated from the frequency shift signal.\n1\n\nPresent email: atif@boulder.nist.gov\n\n1\n\n\fimage of the variable-Rx region of the sample\nis shown in Fig.1(a). Because the doping\nconcentration is constant in the vertical\ndirection we can take the average lateral line\ncuts of STM topography (the open squares in\nFig. 1(b) on the right vertical axis). The\ncalculated Rx profile of the sample as a\nfunction of position is also shown in Fig. 1(b)\n(dashed line on left vertical axis). This Rx\nprofile is calculated using the FIB beam\nparameters [10] and the knowledge of the\nimplanted Boron depth and profile [11,12].\nThe region of high Boron concentration (and\nlow Rx) is on the left side of the sample. This\npart of the sample is damaged (labeled so in\nFig. 1(b)) because the beam dwell time was\nvery long on this region to dope to a high\nconcentration. As a result there is roughly 10\nnm of topography present in the high Boron\nconcentration region. The extreme right hand\nside of the doped area close to the un-doped\nSilicon also shows some topography of about\n5 nm. In between, there is a lateral region of\n4 \u03bcm which on average has zero (\u00b11 nm)\ntopography, labeled as 'topography-free'\nregion in Fig. 1(b). This is a good region for\nmaintaining a constant height of the probe\nabove the sample while the NSMM contrast\nhere is expected to be due to the changes in\nRx alone.\n\nAs CMOS (Complimentary Metal-OxideSemiconductor) technology reaches the sub45 nm node, and operating frequencies of\nintegrated circuits reach into the microwave\nregime, there is a strong need to\nquantitatively measure local materials\nproperties at microwave frequencies with\nnanometer spatial-resolution [1,2]. For\nexample, there is a need to develop\nmetrological tools to characterize ultrashallow-doped\nfilms\nfor\nsub-micron\nsemiconductor devices [3], which requires\nlocal measurement of materials properties\nsuch as sheet-resistance (Rx). Similarly,\nmetrological tools are required to understand\nthe basic physics of carbon nano-tubes and\nnano-wires before they become useful for\nelectronics [1]. To achieve such goals, Nearfield Scanning Microwave Microscopes\n(NSMM) have been developed as\nquantitative metrology tools [4,5], and with\nsuch microscopes, the local Rx has been\nmeasured with spatial resolution on the\nmicrometer length scale [6-8]. However,\nsample topography affects the measured\nNSMM signals [9] and it is quite challenging\nto separate the topographic effects from\nmaterials properties [7]. Such challenges\nraise questions regarding the ability of\nNSMM to be a useful metrology tool for\nnano-science and nano-technology. In order\nto demonstrate the NSMM as a useful\nmetrology tool at such length scales, we\ndesigned a topography-free sample with\nvarying Rx on the nanometer length scale.\nThis sample, prepared using Focused Ion\nBeam (FIB) implantation [10], (described in\ndetail elsewhere [11, 12]), has been measured\nwith a high-resolution NSMM which utilizes\nScanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) for\ndistance-following [13] and is capable of\nmeasuring Rx variations of thin films [7].\n\nWhile maintaining the NSMM probe at\nconstant height of 1 nm above the sample\n[14], the quality factor (Q) and frequency\nshift (\u0394f) images were acquired as shown in\nFig 1(c) and 1(d) where the frequency of the\nexperiment is 7.472 GHz. The doped region\nclearly shows Q and \u0394f contrast in the\ntopography-free region. The NSMM\nresponds to the variable-Rx region of the\nsample through both reactive and resistive\ninteractions with the sample. The NSMM\nalso responds to the damaged (strong\ntopography) area. Since the sample has no Rx\nvariation in the vertical direction, one can\ntake lateral line segments at a fixed vertical\nposition from the topography-free area, and\naverage them together to form the line cuts\n(shown in Fig 2 for \u0394f and Fig. 3 for Q). The\ndata over the region of damage (as seen on\n\nThe sample is a 10 \u03bcm x 10 \u03bcm patch with a\nsheet resistance gradient ranging from Rx =\n30 \u03a9/ to 5.5x105 \u03a9/ over a lateral length\nscale of 10 \u03bcm (Fig. 1). However, the\ntopography-free region has values in the\nrange Rx = 103 \u03a9/ to 4x105 \u03a9/ , as will be\ndiscussed shortly. The STM topography\n\n2\n\n\f1.06 m and attenuation \u03b1 is frequency\ndependent (0.0673 Np/m at 1.058 GHz to\n0.209 Np/m at 9.602 GHz).\n\nthe left side of the images), and the data with\ntopography close to bare Silicon on the right\nare not shown in these averages. Similar\nimages and analysis were also obtained at\nmicrowave frequencies of 1.058 GHz, 3.976\nGHz, and 9.602 GHz, with all experiments\nperformed at room temperature.\n\nThe Rx contrast in the \u0394f/f0 signal saturates\nbelow an Rx of about 10 k\u03a9/ and above\nabout 400 k\u03a9/ for this probe geometry and\nfrequency range, as seen in Fig. 2. For the Rx\nvalues in between, the signal shows the\nlargest contrast range. We expect the\nsensitivity of microscope frequency shift to\nsheet resistance to be maximized near the\ncondition that the magnitude of the capacitive\nreactance is equal to the resistive impedance\nof the sample presented to the probe tip [13].\nThis is true for all frequencies, as we note\nthat \u03c9Cx(ARx) \u2245 1 roughly in the middle of\nthe \u0394f/f0 contrast range (dots in Fig. 2). For\nexample, for the frequency of 1.058 GHz,\nthis point is near Rx = 75,000 \u03a9/ and\n\u03c9Cx(ARx) = 1.2. The Q`/Q0 vs. sheet\nresistance data (Fig. 3 where Q0 is the quality\nfactor with no sample present) also shows a\nlocal minimum where the magnitude of the\ncapacitive reactance is equal to the resistive\nimpedance (shown as black dots) of the\nsample presented to the probe tip [7, 13].\n\nA lumped element model [4] of the\nmicroscope/sample interaction used to\nunderstand the data is shown schematically in\nthe inset of Fig. 2. The sample in this case is\na thin doped layer with circuit impedance\nARx, on top of bulk Silicon, with impedance\nZSi. Rx is the sheet resistance of the doped\nlayer and A is a geometrical coefficient\nrelating the circuit impedance to the field\nimpedance [4], which arises due to the\ngeometry of the probe and presence of\ndifferent boundary conditions [15, 16] in the\nsample. The substrate impedance ZSi includes\nthe resistivity \u03c1sub of the bulk Silicon (\u03c1sub =\n61 \u03a9.cm) and the (assumed real) dielectric\nconstant (\u03b5Si = 11.9). The capacitance\nbetween the (STM-tip) inner-conductor of the\ntransmission line resonator and the sample is\nlabeled as Cx, and the capacitance between\nthe sample and outer conductor is labeled as\nCout (Cout ~ pF >> Cx ~ fF).\n\nTo fit the data in Figs. 2 & 3, the probe\ncharacteristic dimension Dt was fixed to 15\n\u03bcm (which is twice the typical R0 value when\nthe probe is regarded as a sphere of radius R0\n[14]). The other fitting parameters are the tipto-sample capacitance Cx and the geometrical\nfactor A. In Figs. 2 & 3 we show the fit to the\n\u0394f/f0 and Q`/Q0 data (solid lines),\nrespectively at different frequencies, with the\nfit parameters shown in Table 1. The fits to\n\u0394f/f0 vs Rx for all frequencies are excellent,\nwhile the same fits also describe the high-Rx\nQ'/Q0 data quite well. The Cx fit value\nsystematically decreases as the frequency\nincreases because the tip-sample capacitance\nCx can be regarded as a series combination of\ntwo capacitors; one from the geometry of the\ntip and the sample (Cgeometry) and the second is\nthe material dependent capacitor (Cmaterial)\n[17]. The skin depth of the Silicon substrate\nis also decreasing as the frequency increases,\nand as a result the value of Cmaterial is\n\nThe expressions [4] to calculate the quality\nfactor and frequency shift from the near-field\nmodel include the following parameters. The\ntransmission\nline\nresonator\n(with\ncharacteristic impedance Z0 = 50\u03a9,\nattenuation \u03b1, the mode number n and the\nlength Lres) is terminated by the STM tip\n(electrical tip), with a characteristic size\n(called Dt) and the sample. The tip and\nsample together have impedance ZtE which is\nthe sum of the resistive (RtE) and the reactive\n(XtE) impedances. Assuming that |ZtE|>>Z0,\nthe complex reflection coefficient [2] is\ncalculated (for the geometry shown in the\ninset of Fig. 2) for the resonant condition of\nthe transmission line resonator. This yields\npredictions for the quality factor Q' and\nrelative frequency shift \u0394f/f0 for the resonator\nas shown in [4]. The effective dielectric\nconstant of the resonator is \u03b5eff = 2.5, Lres =\n\n3\n\n\fclear and distinct contrast in \u0394f/f0. This\nsuggests that the quantitative spatialresolution in Rx is no worse than 100 nm for\nthe NSMM employed here (consistent with\n[13]). By designing probes with larger values\nof the geometry factor A, one can increase\nsensitivity to lower Rx films and materials\nwhile maintaining high spatial resolution.\n\neffectively increasing. Hence at higher\nfrequencies, Cgeometry is becoming the more\ndominant capacitor approaching the value (\u2248\n1 fF) we expect for tip-sample capacitance\n[13] calculated from a conducting sphere\nabove an infinite conducting plane model.\nBesides the tip-sample capacitance Cx, the\nother fitting parameter is A [4], which links\nthe material properties of the sample to ZtE,\nand is dependent on the geometry of the tip\n[4] and the sample [15,16]. For an ideal\ncoaxial Corbino-geometry contact (with rout =\n840\u03bcm and rin = 255\u03bcm), we expect the value\nof A to be 0.19 [18]. However, A can vary if\nthe geometry deviates from the rightcylindrical Corbino-structure, which is the\ncase in our system due to a conical-tip (with\nembedded sphere at the end [14]), and the\ngeometrical features on the sample (with and\nwithout topography). The non-topographic\nfeatures on the sample include the 10 x 10\n\u03bcm2 Boron-doped patches and the finite\nthickness of the Silicon wafer (smaller than\nboth the wavelength and the skin-depth for\nthe measured frequency range). The\ngeometrical features with topography (in the\nlow Rx region) are about 4 x 10 \u03bcm2 in size.\nThe presence of topography in this region\nincreases the dissipated power locally [16],\naffecting primarily the quality factor, as seen\nin Fig. 3 for Q`/Q0 in the low Rx region (the\nvalue of A in parentheses in Table I fits the\nminimum in this region). As the frequency of\nmeasurement increases, the value of A\ndecreases due to the decreasing skin-depth\nand associated changes in field configuration.\n\nWe thank Andrew Schwartz and Vladimir\nTalanov\nof\nNeocera/Solid\nState\nMeasurements, Inc for insightful discussions.\nThis work has been supported by NSF\nGOALI (DMR-0201261) and NSF/ECS0322844.\nReferences\n[1] Semiconductor Industry Assn.

This region\nshows a continuous variation in Rx from\nvalues of 1000\u03a9/ to 400k\u03a9/ . As seen in\nFig. 2, the frequency shift signal shows a\nclear contrast in this region. Looking at the\ndata in the region where the magnitude of the\ncapacitive reactance is equal to the resistive\nimpedance of the sample presented to the\nprobe tip (\u03c9Cx(ARx) \u2245 1), two data points\nthat are 100 nm apart on the sample show a\n\n4\n\n\fTable I: The fit parameters (Cx, A) values for the fits shown as\nsolid lines in Figs 2 and 3 at the corresponding frequencies for\nfixed probe characteristic dimension Dt. The A parameter\nvalues in the brackets fit the low-Rx quality factor data minima,\nand create the fits shown as dashed lines in Fig. 3.\nf(GHz)\n\nCx (fF)\n\nA\n\n1.058\n\nDt (\u03bcm)\n15\n\n16.5\n\n0.15 (3)\n\n3.976\n\n15\n\n10.3\n\n0.05 (0.65)\n\n7.472\n\n15\n\n7.7\n\n0.05 (0.50)\n\n9.602\n\n15\n\n5.0\n\n0.047 (0.27)\n\nFigures\nFig 3: Symbols show the averaged Q`/Q0 line cuts through Fig.\n1(c) for four different frequencies.
