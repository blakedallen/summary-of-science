FERN\u00c1NDEZ DE BOBADILLA, I. LUENGO, A. MELLE-HERN\u00c1NDEZ, AND A. N\u00c9METHI\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is a very old and interesting open problem to characterize those collections of embedded\ntopological types of local plane curve singularities which may appear as singularities of a\nprojective plane curve C of degree d. (We invite the reader to consult the articles of\nFenske, Flenner, Orevkov, Tono, Zaidenberg, Yoshihara, and the references therein, for\nrecent developments.) The goal of the present article is to give a complete (topological)\nclassification of those cases when C is rational and it has a unique singularity which is\nlocally irreducible (i.e. C is unicuspidal) with one Puiseux pair.\nIn fact, as a second goal, we also wish to present some of the techniques which are/might\nbe helpful in such a classification, and we invite the reader to join us in our effort to produce\na classification for all the cuspidal rational plane curves. In fact, this effort also motivates\nthat decision, that in some cases (in order to have a better understanding of the present\nsituation), we produce more different arguments for some of the steps.\nIn the next paragraph we formulate the main result. We will write d for the degree of\nC and (a, b) for the Puiseux pair of its cusp, where 1 < a < b. We denote by {\u03c6j }j\u22650 the\nFibonacci numbers \u03c60 = 0, \u03c61 = 1, \u03c6j+2 = \u03c6j+1 + \u03c6j .\n1.1. Theorem. The Puiseux pair (a, b) can be realized by a unicuspidal rational plane curve\nof degree d if and only if (d, a, b) appears in the following list.\n(a) (a, b) = (d \u2212 1, d);\n(b) (a, b) = (d/2, 2d \u2212 1), where d is even;\n(c) (a, b) = (\u03c62j\u22122 , \u03c62j ) and d = \u03c62j\u22121 + 1 = \u03c6j\u22122 \u03c6j , where j is odd and \u2265 5;\n(d) (a, b) = (\u03c6j\u22122 , \u03c6j+2 ) and d = \u03c6j , where j is odd and \u2265 5;\n(e) (a, b) = (\u03c64 , \u03c68 + 1) = (3, 22) and d = \u03c66 = 8;\n(f ) (a, b) = (2\u03c64 , 2\u03c68 + 1) = (6, 43) and d = 2\u03c66 = 16.\nAll these cases are realizable: (a) e.g. by {zy d\u22121 = xd }, (b) by {(zy \u2212 x2 )d/2 = xy d\u22121 },\nor by the parametrization [z(t) : x(t) : y(t)] = [1 + td\u22121 : td/2 : td ]. The existence of (c) and\n(d) is guaranteed by Kashiwara classification [4], Corollary 11.4. These two cases can be\nrealized by a rational pencil of type (0, 1): the generic member of the pencil is (c), while the\nspecial member of the pencil is of type (d) (cf. also with the last paragraphs of the present\narticle). Orevkov in [6] provides a different construction for curves which realize the case\n(d) (denoted by him by Cj ). Similarly, the cases (e) and (f) are realized by the sporadic\ncases C4 and C4\u2217 of Orevkov [6].\nKey words and phrases.

Melle-Hern\u00e1ndez, A. N\u00e9methi\n\n1.2. Remarks. (1) Since C is rational and its singular locus p has Milnor number \u03bc =\n(a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1), the genus formula says that\n(a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1) = (d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2).\n\n(1)\n\nOn the other hand, not any triple (d, a, b) with (a \u2212 1)(b \u2212 1) = (d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) can be\ngeometrically realized. E.g., (5, 3, 7) or (17, 6, 49) cannot.\n(2) There are two integers which coordinate the above classification. The first one is\ndefined as follows. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 P2 be the minimal good embedded resolution of C \u2282 P2 , and\nlet C\u0304 be the strict transform of C. Clearly, (\u03c0 \u2217 C, C\u0304) = C 2 = d2 , and \u03c0 \u2217 C = C\u0304 + abE\u22121 + . . .\n(where E\u22121 is the unique \u22121 exceptional curve of \u03c0), hence d2 = C\u0304 2 + ab. Using (1), we\nget:\n\u001a\na + b = 3d \u2212 1 \u2212 C\u0304 2\n(2)\nab = d2 \u2212 C\u0304 2 .\n\nThen C\u0304 2 in the above cases is as follows: it is positive for (a) and (b), it is zero for (c),\nequals \u22121 for (d), and = \u22122 for (e) and (f).\n(3) The second guiding integer is the logarithmic Kodaira dimensions \u03ba\u0304 := \u03ba\u0304(P2 \\ C) (cf.\n[3]). Its values are the following (cf. [6]): \u2212\u221e for (a)-(d), and 2 for the last two sporadic\ncases. (In particular, \u03ba\u0304 depends only on the integers (d, a, b), and it is independent on the\nanalytic type of C which realizes these integers.)\nIn particular, the above classification shows that \u03ba\u0304 = \u2212\u221e if and only if C\u0304 2 > \u22122.\nIn fact, after we finished the manuscript, we learned from the introduction of [8] that in\n[14] (written in Japanese) it is proved that for any unicuspidal rational curve C, \u03ba\u0304 = \u2212\u221e if\nand only if C\u0304 2 > \u22122. Using [14] (i.e. this equivalence), a possible 'quick' classification for\nC\u0304 2 > \u22122 would run as follows: Since for all these cases \u03ba\u0304 = \u2212\u221e, we just have to separate in\nKashivara's classification [4] those unicuspidal curves with exactly one Puiseux pair. Their\nnumerical invariants (d, a, b) are exactly those listed in (a)-(d).\nOn the other hand, this argument probably does not show what is really behind the\nclassification of this case. Therefore, we decided to keep the structure of our manuscript,\nand provide an independent classification.\nNote also that in [1] we list the complete topological classification of the cuspidal rational\ncurves with \u03ba\u0304 < 2. In fact \u03ba\u0304 = 0 cannot occur because of a result of Tsunoda's [9], see also\nOrevkov's paper [6]. Moreover, Tono in [8] provides all the possible curves C with \u03ba\u0304 = 1:\nthere is no one with one Puiseux pair.\nHence, in our case, the remaining part of the classification corresponds to C\u0304 2 \u2264 \u22122, or\nequivalently, to \u03ba\u0304 = 2. In general, the classification of this ('general') case is the most\ndifficult; and in our case it is not clear at all at the beginning (and, in fact, it is rather\nsurprising) that there\u221aare only two (sporadic) cases satisfying these data.\n(4) Let \u03b1 = (3 + 5)/2 be the root of \u03b1 + \u03b11 = 3. Notice that in family (d) d/a and\nb/d asymptotically equals \u03b1. In fact, for j odd, {\u03c6j /\u03c6j\u22122 }j are the increasing convergents\nof the continued fraction of \u03b1. Using this, another remarkable property of the family (d)\ncan be described as follows (cf. [6], page 658). The convex hull of all the pairs (m, d) \u2208 Z2\nsatisfying m + 1 \u2264 d < \u03b1m (cf. with the sharp Orevkov inequality [6], or 2.7) coincides\nwith the convex hull of all pairs (m, d) realizable by rational unicuspidal curves C (where\nd = deg(C) and m = mult(C, p)) with \u03ba\u0304(P2 \\ C) = \u2212\u221e; moreover, this convex hull is\ngenerated by curves with numerical data (a) and (d).\n(5) It is clear that the families (a)-(d) are organized in nice series of curves. It is less\nclear from the statement of the theorem, but rather clear from the proof, that also (e)-(f)\nform a 'series': they are the only curves with 3d = 8a (cf. also with the next remark).\n\n\fRational unicuspidal plane curves\n\n3\n\n(6) A hidden massage of the classification (and some of the steps of the proof) is that\nthere is an intimate relationship between the semigroup of N generated by the elements a\nand b, and the intervals of type ( (l \u2212 1)d , ld ]. The endpoints d and 3d play crucial roles in\nsome of the arguments. (E.g., C\u0304 2 \u2264 \u22122 if and only if a + b > 3d; see also 2.8.) This fact is\ndeeply exploited in [1]. In fact, that paper strongly motivated the present manuscript.\n(7) The (part of the) proof in section 4 clearly shows the deficiencies of the known\nrestrictions, bounds which connect the local data (a, b) with the degree d \u2013 although we\nlist and try to use a large number of them. On the other hand, the above classification fits\nperfectly with the conjectured restriction proposed by the authors in [1] (valid in a more\ngeneral situation), which, in fact, alone would provide the classification.\nThe authors thanks Maria Aparecida Ruas and Jean-Paul Brasselet for the wonderfull\natmosphera in the \"VIII\u00e9me Rencontre Internationale de S\u00e3o Carlos sur les singularit\u00e9s\nre\u00e9lles et complexes au CIRM\". We also thank J. Stevens for pointing us out the full\nstrength of the semicontinuity of the spectrum to eliminate some cases in the classification.\nFinally we thank David Lehavi who wrote for the fourth author some computer programs\nto help in the classification.\n2. Restrictions and bounds\nIn the present section we list some general results which impose some restrictions for the\nintegers (d, a, b). We start with a trivial one: (1) and (2) clearly imply:\n2.1. The 'trivial' bound. In any situation b \u2265 d. Moreover, if b = d then (a, b) =\n(d \u2212 1, d).\nIf b > d then a < d \u2212 1. The next result proves a 'gap' for a: if a < d \u2212 1 then a \u2264 d/2\ntoo.\n2.2. Lemma. The 'dual curve bound'. If b > d then d \u2265 2a (hence b > 2a too).\nProof. Let (C, p) be the germ of the singular point p of C, and let {mi }i be the multiplicity\nsequence of (C, p). We will use the symbol \u2228 for the corresponding invariants of the dual\ncurve C \u2228 of C. By a result of C.T.C. Wall [13] Proposition 7.4.5, the blow ups of the\nsingularities (C, p) and (C \u2228 , p\u2228 ) (where p\u2228 corresponds to the tangent cone of (C, p)) are\n\u2228\nequisingular. Assume that b < 2a. Then m2 = b\u2212a, hence m\u2228\n2 = b\u2212a \u2264 m1 . But, according\n[13], the intersection multiplicity of the tangent cone of (C, p) with C at p is i = m1 + m\u2228\n1,\n\u2265\na\n+\nb\n\u2212\na\n=\nb,\na\ncontradiction.\nIn\nparticular,\nb\n\u2265\n2a.\nIn\nthis\ncase\nhence d \u2265 i = m1 + m\u2228\n1\n\u2228\nm2 = a, hence m\u2228\n\u0003\n2 = a as well. The above argument gives: d \u2265 i \u2265 m1 + m1 \u2265 2a.\n2.3. The semicontinuity of the spectrum. The very existence of the curve C shows\nthat the local plane curve singularity (C, p) is in the deformation of the local plane curve\nsingularity (U, 0) := (xd + y d , 0) (see e.g. [2] (3.24)). In particular, we can use the semicontinuity of the spectrum for this pair [11, 12]. More precisely, this assures that in any\ninterval (c, c + 1), the number of spectral numbers of (C, p) is not larger than the number\nof spectral numbers of (U, 0).

We denote by #d\u22121 the number of lattice points\nat the left hand side of (SSd\u22121 ).

Other examples of (SSl ). (SS2 ) is equivalent with 1/a + 1/b \u2265 2/d. This is true\nautomatically, since 1/a + 1/b \u2265 1/d + 1/(d \u2212 1) > 2/d. The next inequality (SS3 ) is\nequivalent with 2/b + 1/a \u2265 3/d, which also is satisfied automatically.\nIf b > d then a + 2b > 3a + b (cf. 2.2), hence (SS4 ) is equivalent with the pair of\ninequalities: a + 2b \u2265 4ab/d and 4a + b \u2265 4ab/d.

The 'semigroup density property'. [1] Let \u0393 be the semigroup of (C, p), i.e. the\nsemigroup (with 0) of N generated by the integers a and b. Then for any 0 \u2264 l < d the\nfollowing inequality holds:\n#\u0393 \u2229 [0, ld] \u2265 (l + 1)(l + 2)/2.\nProof. It is instructive to sketch the proof for l = 3 case: we wish to prove #\u0393 \u2229 [0, 3d] \u2265 10.\nRecall that a cubic is determined by 9 parameters. Therefore, #\u0393 \u2229 [0, 3d] \u2264 9 would imply\nthe existence of a cubic with intersection multiplicity with C at p strict greater than 3d,\nwhich contradicts B\u00e9zout's theorem.\n\u0003\nIn the classical theory, many 'candidates' (d, a, b) were eliminated by different geometric\nconstrictions using ingenious Cremona transformations. We will exemplify this in 4.8.\n3. The classification in the case C\u0304 2 > 0\n3.1. Theorem. If C\u0304 2 > 0 then either (a, b) = (d \u2212 1, d) or (a, b) = (d/2, 2d \u2212 1).\nProof. Since b \u2265 d (cf. 2.1), by (3) we get that C\u0304 2 \u2264 d. Clearly, equality holds if and only\nif (a, b) = (d \u2212 1, d). Next, assume that 0 < C\u0304 2 < d. Then again by (3) one has \u230ab/d\u230b \u2264 1,\nor b < 2d. But notice that b < 2d \u2212 1 would imply (by (1)) that a > d/2 which contradicts\n2.2. Hence b = 2d \u2212 1.\n\u0003\n4. Classification in the case C\u0304 2 \u2264 \u22122\n4.1. Our first goal is to prove that 3d \u2265 8a. For this we apply 2.8 for l = 3. Since a+b > 3d\n(cf.

Melle-Hern\u00e1ndez, A. N\u00e9methi\n\n4.2. Corollary. \u03ba\u0304(P2 \\ C) = 2.\nProof. \u03ba\u0304 cannot be \u2212\u221e because of 2.7(a); cannot be 0 because of [6], Theorem B(c) (see also\n[9]). Unicuspidal rational curves with \u03ba\u0304 = 1 are classified by K. Tono [8], the corresponding\nsplice diagrams are listed in [1]: there is no example with one Puiseux pair.\n\u0003\nNow, the classification for C\u0304 2 \u2264 \u22122 can be finished in two different ways.\n4.3. First proof. Using the computer. The first version is based on the inequality\n2.7(b). Notice that in the case of a geometric realization one must have\n3\u03b1(a + 1) \u2212 3\u03b2 > 3d \u2265 8a,\n\nwhich is true only if a \u2264 44, (or, by using again d < \u03b1(a + 1) \u2212 \u03b2), only if d \u2264 117.\nHence, we have only to analyze the finite family determined by, say, d \u2264 117. Then, one\ncan search with the computer for 3-uples (d, a, b) verifying all the restrictions considered\nabove. E.g., we used the conditions d \u2264 117, gcd(a, b) = 1, a < d < b, d < 3a, 3d \u2265 8a,\n2 \u2264 \u2212C\u0304 2 \u2264 \u22122 + ab + ab , b < \u03b1(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2)/(d \u2212 2\u03b1 + \u03b2)) + 1, (d \u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b2)/\u03b1 < a,\nand (SSd\u22121 ), (SSd\u22122 ), (SSd\u22123 ), (SSd\u22124 ), (SS4 ). Using the inequality 3d \u2265 8a and a similar\ncomputation as in the case of (SSd\u22121 ), we obtain that (SSd\u22124 ) is equivalent with\nj 4b k j 4b b k l 4C\u0304 2 m\n+\n+\n\u2264 13.\n(5)\n\u2212\nd\nd\na\nd\nThen the only triplets satisfying all these are listed below (in the list appears (d, a, b; C\u0304 2 ):\nC1 := ( 8, 3, 22; \u22122),\nC2 := (11, 4, 31; \u22123),\nC3 := (16, 6, 43; \u22122),\nC4 := (17, 6, 49; \u22125),\nC5 := (19, 7, 52; \u22123),\nC6 := (20, 7, 58; \u22126).\nNext, notice that the curves C1 and C3 exist, they are listed in our classification theorem.\nThe others do not exist: C2 is eliminated by Orevkov in [6], page 2 (see also 4.9 (b)); C4\nand C6 can be excluded by the semicontinuity property of the spectrum (applied for all the\nintervals of type (l/d, l/d + 1), \u2212d < l < d), finally C5 can be eliminated by the 'nodal cubic\ntrick', see 4.9 (a). (Notice also that C2 and C5 cannot be eliminated by the semicontinuity\nproperty.)\n4.4. Second proof. Resolving diophantic equations. Next we show how one can\nanalyse the case 3d \u2265 8a (cf. 4.1) by a diophantic equation (for the convenience of the\nreader, later we will make more precise the geometry behind this equation, cf. 4.7 and 4.8).\nOur goal is to eliminate everything excepting C1 and C3 , and to emphasize that C exists if\nand only if 3d = 8a, and C1 and C3 are the only solutions with 3d = 8a.\nLet us write x := 3d \u2212 8a \u2265 0. Then clearly 3|a \u2212 x. Moreover,\n\u2212C\u0304 2 (a \u2212 1) = \u2212(3d \u2212 1 \u2212 a \u2212 b)(a \u2212 1) = \u2212(x + 7a \u2212 1 \u2212 b)(a \u2212 1)\n\n= (b \u2212 1)(a \u2212 1) \u2212 (x + 7a \u2212 2)(a \u2212 1) = (d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) \u2212 (x + 7a \u2212 2)(a \u2212 1).\nUsing again d = (x + 8a)/3 one gets\n\u22129C\u0304 2 (a \u2212 1) = x2 + 7ax + a2 + 9a.\n\n(6)\n\n4.5. The case x = 0. (6) implies the divisibility a \u2212 1|10. Since one also has 3|a, the only\nsolutions are a = 3 and a = 6, corresponding to C1 and C3 above.\n\n\fRational unicuspidal plane curves\n\n7\n\n4.6. Facts. \u2212C\u0304 2 \u2264 7 and x \u2264 5.\nProof. First we verify \u2212C\u0304 2 \u2264 7. It is easy to verify (using (1), (2) and d/3 < a \u2264 d/2, cf.\n2.6 and 2.2) that for 6 \u2264 d \u2264 10 this is true. Hence assume that d \u2265 11. Notice that if for\nsome (positive) k one has kd \u2264 \u2212C\u0304 2 < (k + 1)d, then (3) gives b/d \u2264 3 + k. But d/a < 3 by\n2.6, hence b/a < 3(3 + k). Using 2.7(c) one gets \u2212C\u0304 2 \u2264 3k + 7. Since for k > 0 and d \u2265 11\none has 3k + 7 < dk, one should have k = 0.\nUsing this and x \u2265 6, from (6) we get 63(a \u2212 1) \u2265 36 + 42a + a2 + 9a, which has no\nsolution.\n\u0003\nNow, we consider the above equation (6) for x \u2265 1. By 4.6 we only have to analyse the\ncases 1 \u2264 x \u2264 5, and eliminate all the solutions.\n\nThe case x = 1. In this case one has \u22129(C\u0304 2 + 2)(a \u2212 1) = (a \u2212 1)2 + 18, hence 3|a \u2212 1|18\nbut 9 6 |a \u2212 1. In particular, a = 4 or 7 corresponding to C2 and C5 above.\nThe case x = 2. Similarly as above, a \u2212 1|28 and 3|a \u2212 2, hence a \u2212 1 = 4, 7 or 28. In\nfact, if a = 5 then d = 12 and b 6\u2208 Z. The next case (d, a, b; C\u0304 2 ) = (22, 8, 61; \u22124) can be\neliminated by (5); the last (78, 29, 210; \u22126) by 2.7(c).\nThe case x = 3. Now a \u2212 1|40 and 3|a. The possible a's are a = 3 which gives d =\n9 contradicting 2.6; a = 6 providing C4 ; a = 9 providing (25, 9, 70; \u22125) which can be\neliminated by (5), and a = 21 providing (57, 21, 155; \u22126) which is eliminated by 2.7(c).\nThe case x = 4. (6) has two solutions: C6 : (20, 7, 58; \u22126) and (28, 10, 79; \u22126), the second\none can be eliminated by (5).\nThe case x = 5 provides two integral solutions: (23, 8, 67; \u22127) and (31, 11, 88; \u22127). Both\ncan be eliminated by 2.7(c).\nWe end this section by the description of the promised geometric construction (used also\nin [6] and by E. Artal-Bartolo as well).\n4.7. Lemma. The existence of a specific nodal cubic. There exists an (unique)\nirreducible cubic N \u2282 P2 with a node singularity at p such that N and C share the first\nseven infinitely near points at p.\nProof. A cubic is determined by nine parameters. The multiplicity sequence of N at p\nshould be [2, 16 ]. Passing through p and having multiplicity 2 provides 3 conditions. The\nremaining six conditions are imposed by the remaining six infinitely near points. The\ncondition which would imply that the singularity (N, p) is a cusp would involve another\nequation (the vanishing of the determinant of the quadratic part at p), and the corresponding\nsystem of equations would not have any solution. Similar arguments eliminates other type\nof singularities (two smooth branches with contact two, or (N, p) with multiplicity 3). Hence\n(N, p) is a node.\nNext we prove that N cannot be a product of three linear forms. Indeed, the tangent\nline L0 of C at p goes just through the first two infinitely near points because d < 3a and\nd = L0 * C. Any other line has less tangency than L0 . This also shows that N cannot be\nL0 * Q for some Q (transversal to L0 at p).\nThe remaining posibility is N = LQ where Q is a smooth conic and L and Q meets\ntransversally at p. Since Q is determined by five conditions (five infinitely near points) then\nQ and C must be tangent and share the seven infinitely near points at p. In particular by\nBezout 2d = Q * C \u2265 6a which is in contradiction with d < 3a, cf. 2.6.\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nJ. Fern\u00e1ndez de Bobadilla, I. Luengo, A. Melle-Hern\u00e1ndez, A. N\u00e9methi\n\n4.8. The Cremona transformation associated with the nodal cubic N . Consider\nthe nodal cubic N given by 4.7. First we verify that C and N share exactly the first seven\ninfinitely near points. Indeed, assume that this is not the case. If b \u2264 8a then the multiplicity\nsequence of (C, P ) is [a7 , b \u2212 7a, ...], hence 3d \u2265 2a + 6a + b \u2212 7a = a + b = 3d \u2212 1 \u2212 C\u0304 2 > 3d,\na contradiction. If b > 8a then the multiplicity sequence of (C, P ) is [a8 , ...], hence 3d \u2265 9a\nwhich contradicts 2.6.\nIn particular, the intersection multiplicity of C and N at P is 8a. Assume that C \u2229 N =\n{P, P1 , . . . , Pr }. Notice that at Pi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r) both curves C and N are smooth,\nPlet ki be\ntheir intersection multiplicity\nat\nP\n.\nBy\nBezout's\ntheorem\none\nhas\n3d\n=\n8a\n+\ni\ni ki . We\nP\nprefer to write x := i ki , hence 3d = 8a + x (and the notation is compatible with above).\nBlow up the common seven infinitely near points. We get seven irreducible exceptional\ndivisors {Ei }7i=1 . Let C\u0303 and \u00d1 be the strict transforms of C and N . One has the following\nintersections: E12 = * * * = E62 = \u22122, E72 = \u22121, \u00d1 2 = \u22121, E1 * E2 = E2 * E3 = * * * =\nE6 * E7 = 1, E1 * \u00d1 = E7 * \u00d1 = 1. Also, C\u0303 intersects E7 (but not the other irreducible\nexceptional divisors) at a point P \u2032 , and the singularity (C\u0303, P \u2032 ) has exactly one Puiseux pairs\nof type (b \u2212 7a, a). The intersection of \u00d1 with E7 is not P \u2032 .\nConsider now the curve \u00d1 \u222a \u222a6i=1 Ei . Clearly, this can be blown down, and after this\nmodification \u03c0 we get another copy of P2 . Let the image of C\u0303 via this projection be C \u2032 . By\nstandard (intersection) argument one gets that the degree d\u2032 of C \u2032 is\nd\u2032 = 8d \u2212 21a (which also satisfies 3d\u2032 = 8x + a).\n\nThe curve C \u2032 has at most two singular points. One candidate is the (isomorphic) image of\nthe germ at P \u2032 with one Puiseux pair (b \u2212 7a, a). The other is the common image of the\npoints {Pi } (1 \u2264 i \u2264 r). Clearly, if x = 0 then this point does not exist, if x = 1 then this\nis a smooth point, but otherwise it is singular. One can find its embedded resolution graph\nby blowing up (for each i) ki times the point Pi . Hence, by A'Campo's formula one can\ndetermine its Milnor number, which is \u03bc = 7x2 \u2212 7x \u2212 r + 1 (provided that x \u2265 1). Since it\nhas r local irreducible components, the delta-invariant is (7x2 \u2212 7x)/2. Then one can verify\nthat (6) corresponds to the genus formula of C \u2032 .\n4.9. Example. (a) Let us start with (d, a, b) = (19, 7, 52). Then x = 1, hence C \u2032 is again\nrational and unicuspidal with (d\u2032 , a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) = (5, 3, 7). But such a curve does not exist because\nof 3.1 (one can also check the classification of rational curves of degree five e.g. in [5]).\n(b) Let us consider now the curve C2 above with data (d, a, b) = (11, 4, 31). Then x = 1,\nhence C \u2032 is rational unicuspidal, say at Q1 , with (d\u2032 , a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) = (4, 3, 4). Notice that a curve\nwith this triplet may exists \u2013 although C2 does not. The image N\u0304 under the modification\n\u03c0 of the exceptional curve E7 is a (rational) nodal cubic with a node, say at Q2 (6= Q1 ).\nMoreover, N\u0304 * C \u2032 = 4Q1 + 8Q2 . At Q1 , N\u0304 is non-singular and with the same tangent as\nC \u2032 , and at Q2 the quartic C \u2032 has intersection multiplicity 7 with one of the branches of the\nnode of N\u0304 and 1 with the other. To show that C2 does not exist we will prove that such\nconfiguration of the rational curves C \u2032 and N\u0304 in P2 does not exist.\nChoosing affine coordinates we may assume that C \u2032 is given by the zero locus of ay 3 +\na1 y 3 x + a2 y 2 x2 + a3 yx3 + x4 + a0 y 4 ; with a 6= 0. In such a case Q1 = (0, 0) and its tangent\nline L1 = {y = 0} verifies L1 * C \u2032 = 4Q1 . The curve C \u2032 has a parametrization given by\n[z(\u03bb, t) : x(\u03bb, t) : y(\u03bb, t)] = [\u03bb4 + a3 t\u03bb3 + a2 t2 \u03bb2 + a1 t3 \u03bb + a0 t4 : \u2212at3 \u03bb : \u2212at4 ].\nTo have IQ1 (N\u0304 , C \u2032 ) = 4 then N\u0304 must be the zero locus of a polyomial y+f2 (x, y)+f3 (x, y)\n(see the parametrization of C \u2032 ), where f2 (x, y) = m1,1 xy + m2,0 x2 + m0,2 y 2 and f3 (x, y) =\nn1,2 xy 2 + n2,1 x2 y + n3,0 x3 + n0,3 y 3 .\n\n\fRational unicuspidal plane curves\n\n9\n\nNext one imposes that, in the affine plane P2 \\ L1 = {y 6= 0}, the curves C \u2032 and N\u0304 must\nmeet at only one point Q2 (with intersection multiplicity 8). The parametrization of C \u2032\nin this affine chart is (z, x) = (s4 + a3 s3 + a2 s2 + a1 s + a0 , \u2212as) and the equation of N\u0304 is\ngiven by z 2 + f2 (x, 1)z + f3 (x, 1) = 0. Imposing to have a solution of the form (As + B)8\ngives B = a3 A/4 which means s = \u2212a3 /4. We have two possibilities: firstly, if a3 = 0\nthen s = 0 and Q2 = (z, x) = (a0 , 0). The solutions are given by m1,1 = 2a1 /a; m2,0 =\n\u22122a2 /a2 ; m0,2 = \u2212(2a0 \u2212 a22 ); n1,2 = (\u22122a0 + a22 )a1 /a; n2,1 = (a21 + 2a0 a2 \u2212 a32 )/a2 ; n3,0 =\n\u22122a1 a2 /a3 ; n0,3 = (a0 \u2212 a22 )a0 . To have N\u0304 a node at Q2 implies a2 vanishes and therefore\nN\u0304 must be a conic which is a contradiction.\nIn the other case, i.e. a3 6= 0 then s = \u2212a3 /4 and Q2 = (z, x) = (z0 , aa3 /4).The solutions\nare given by:\nm1,1 = (16a1 \u2212 a33 )/(8a);\n\nm2,0 = (3/4a23 \u2212 2a2 )/a2 ;\n\nm0,2 = \u22122a0 + a22 + 19a43 /128 \u2212 3a2 a23 /4;\nn1,2 = \u2212(4096a0 a1 \u2212 2048a1 a22 \u2212 304a1 a43 + 1536a1 a2 a23 \u2212 256a0 a33 + a73 )/(2048a);\nn2,1 = (211 a0 a2 + (25 a1 )2 \u2212 210 a32 \u2212 152a2 a43 + 768a22 a23 \u2212 128a1 a33 \u2212 768a0 a23 + 7a63 )/(25 a)2 ;\nn3,0 = (\u221264a1 a2 + 32a3 a22 + 3a53 \u2212 20a2 a33 + 24a1 a23 )/(32a3 );\nn0,3 = a20 \u2212 a0 a22 \u2212 (19/128)a0 a43 + (3/4)a0 a2 a23 + (1/65536)a83 .\n\nIn order N\u0304 to have multiplicity two at Q2 one needs a2 = 3a23 /8 but this condition also\nimpose that the tangent cone of N\u0304 at Q2 is a double line and therefore Q2 cannot be a\nnode. Hence this configuration also does not exist.\n5. The case C\u0304 2 = 0, \u22121\n\nIn this section we find all the integer solution (d, a, b) of (2) with C\u0304 2 = 0, \u22121 and we\nshow that all of them can be realized by some unicuspidal rational plane curve of degree d\nand Puiseux pair (a, b). Let \u03c6j be the i-th Fibonacci number, that is \u03c60 = 0, \u03c61 = 1 and\n\u03c6j+2 := \u03c6j+1 + \u03c6j . They share many interesting properties, see e.g. [10]. We will use here\nthe following :\n3\u03c6j = \u03c6j\u22122 + \u03c6j+2 ,\n\nand \u03c62j = (\u22121)j+1 + \u03c6j\u22121 \u03c6j+1 .\n\n(7)\n\n\u221a\n\nLet \u03a6 = 1+2 5 be the positive solution of the equation \u03a62 \u2212 \u03a6 \u2212 1 = 0. For every integer\nj > 0 one has :\n\u221a\n\u03c6j+1 + \u03c6j\u22121 + \u03c6j 5\nj\n\u03a6 =\n.\n(8)\n2\n5.1. The Pell equation. The system of equations (2) for C\u0304 2 = 0, \u22121 can be transformed\n(see below) into the Pell equation:\nx2 \u2212 5y 2 = \u22124, x, y \u2208 Z.\n(9)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nConsider the\n\u221a number field K = Q[ 5] and its ring of integers R = Z[ 5], which is a UFD.\n\u221a\nIf \u03b3 = x + y 5 is a solution of (9) then its norm is NK (\u03b3) = \u03b3\u03b3\u0304 = \u22124. Consider \u03b7 = 1 + 5,\nthen NK (\u03b7) = \u22124 and \u22124 has\u221a\na prime decomposition \u22124 = \u03b7 \u03b7\u0304. Since the fundamental unit\nof K turns out to be u = 2 + 5 and \u03b3 is associated either to \u03b7 or \u03b7\u0304 then \u03b3 is either \u00b1ur \u03b7\n\n\f10\n\nJ. Fern\u00e1ndez de Bobadilla, I. Luengo, A. Melle-Hern\u00e1ndez, A. N\u00e9methi\n\nor \u00b1\u016br \u03b7\u0304 (since \u016b = \u22121/u) for r \u2208 Z. Moreover NK (u) = \u22121 which implies that r must be\neven, that is r = 2j for j \u2208 Z. Then \u03b7 = 2\u03a6 and from the identity \u03a62 = \u03a6 + 1 one gets\n\u03a63 = u.\nThus solutions of (9) are either \u03b3 = \u00b1u2j \u03b7 = \u00b12\u03a66j+1 or \u03b3 = \u00b1\u016b2j \u03b7\u0304 = \u00b12\u03a6\u03046j+1 with\nj \u2208 Z. Using \u03a6\u03a6\u0304 = \u22121, \u03b3 is either \u00b12\u03a66j+1 , \u00b12\u03a66j\u22121 , or their conjugates \u00b12\u03a6\u03046j+1 , \u00b12\u03a6\u03046j\u22121\nwith j \u2265 0. Using (7) and (8) the set of solutions of (9) is given by\n\u221a \u0001\n(A) \u00b1 \u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j + \u03c66j+1 5 , with j \u2265 0,\n\u221a \u0001\n(B) \u00b1 \u03c66j + \u03c66j\u22122 + \u03c66j\u22121 5 , with j \u2265 0,\n\u221a \u0001\n(C) \u00b1 \u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j \u2212 \u03c66j+1 5 , with j \u2265 0,\n\u221a \u0001\n(D) \u00b1 \u03c66j + \u03c66j\u22122 \u2212 \u03c66j\u22121 5 , with j \u2265 0.\n5.2. The case C\u0304 2 = 0. Since gcd(a, b) = 1 and ab = d2 then a = m2 , b = n2 and d = mn\nfor some positive integers m, n with gcd(m, n) = 1. Thus a + b = 3d \u2212 1 transforms into\nm2 + n2 = 3mn \u2212 1.\n\n(10)\n\n5.3. The case C\u0304 2 = \u22121. The system (2) provides the equation\na2 + d2 = 3ad \u2212 1.\n\n(11)\n\nThus, any solution (\u03c9, v) of \u03c9 2 + v 2 = 3\u03c9v \u2212 1 is a solution of (2\u03c9 \u2212 3v)2 \u2212 5v 2 = \u22124. Hence,\nwith the transformation x = 2\u03c9 \u2212 3v, y =\u221av, \u0001one gets the solutions of (9).\nCase A. If \u03b3 = \u00b1 \u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j + \u03c66j+1 5 , j \u2265 0, is a solution of (9) then v = \u00b1\u03c66j+1\nand \u03c9 = \u00b1(\u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j + 3\u03c66j+1 )/2 = \u00b1\u03c66j+3 is a solution of (10) and (11) (for the\nlast equality use (7)). Since 1 < a < d, if C\u0304 2 = \u22121, then a = \u03c66j+1 , d = \u03c66j+3 and\nb = 3d \u2212 a = 3\u03c66j+3 \u2212 \u03c66j+1 = \u03c66j+5 for some j > 0, by property (7) of Fibonacci\nnumbers. Similarly, if C\u0304 2 = 0, then \u03c9 and v are both either positive or negative which\nimplies a = \u03c626j+1 , b = \u03c626j+3 and d = \u03c9v = \u03c66j+1 \u03c66j+3 = \u03c626j+2 + 1.\n\u221a \u0001\nCase B. If \u03b3 = \u00b1 \u03c66j + \u03c66j\u22122 \u2212 \u03c66j\u22121 5 , j \u2265 0, is a solution of (9) then v =\n\u00b1(\u2212\u03c66j\u22121 ) and \u03c9 = \u00b1(\u03c66j +\u03c66j\u22122 \u22123\u03c66j\u22121 )/2 = \u00b1(\u2212\u03c66j\u22123 ) is a solution of (10) and (11). In\nthe case C\u0304 2 = \u22121, one gets a = \u03c66j\u22123 , d = \u03c66j\u22121 and b = 3d \u2212 a = 3\u03c66j\u22121 \u2212 \u03c66j\u22123 = \u03c66j+1\nwith j > 0. If C\u0304 2 = 0, then \u03c9 and v are both either positive or negative which implies\na = \u03c626j\u22123 , b = \u03c626j\u22121 and d = \u03c9v = \u03c66j\u22121 \u03c66j\u22123 = \u03c626j\u22122 + 1 with j > 0.\n\u221a \u0001\nCase C. If \u03b3 = \u00b1 \u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j \u2212 \u03c66j+1 5 , j \u2265 0, is a solution of (9) then v =\n\u00b1(\u2212\u03c66j+1 ) and \u03c9 = \u00b1(\u03c66j+2 + \u03c66j \u2212 3\u03c66j+1 )/2 = \u00b1(\u2212\u03c66j\u22121 ) is a solution of (10) and\n(11). If C\u0304 2 = \u22121, then a = \u03c66j\u22121 , d = \u03c66j+1 and b = \u03c66j+3 with j > 0. If C\u0304 2 = 0,\nthen \u03c9 and v are both either positive or negative which implies a = \u03c626j\u22121 , b = \u03c626j+1 and\nd = \u03c66j\u22121 \u03c66j+1 = \u03c626j + 1 with j > 0.\nCase D. Any solution in this case is included in the previous cases.\nHence, we determined all the possible integer solutions.\n5.4. Theorem. Classification for C\u0304 2 = \u22121. If C\u0304 2 = \u22121 then (a, b) = (\u03c6j\u22122 , \u03c6j+2 ) and\nd = \u03c6j , with j odd \u2265 5. For every such j there exists a unicuspidal rational plane curve of\ndegree with such invariants.\n5.5. Theorem. Classification for C\u0304 2 = 0. If C\u0304 2 = 0 then (a, b) = (\u03c62j\u22122 , \u03c62j ) and\nd = \u03c62j\u22121 + 1, with j odd \u2265 5. For every such j there exists a unicuspidal rational plane\ncurve with such invariants.\n\n\fRational unicuspidal plane curves\n\n11\n\nWe only need to provide the equations of the curves. We will rely on [4], Corollary 11.4.\nLet (x, y) be a system of affine coordinates in P2 and consider\nP\u22121 = y \u2212 x2 , Q\u22121 = y, P0 = (y \u2212 x2 )2 \u2212 2xy 2 (y \u2212 x2 ) + y 5 ,\n\u0001\nQ0 = y \u2212 x2 , G = xy \u2212 x3 \u2212 y 3 , Qs = Ps\u22121 , Ps = G\u03c62s+1 + Q3s /Qs\u22121 .\nThen Ps is a polynomial in x and y of degree \u03c62s+3 and defines a rational unicuspidal curve\nwhose unique singularity p has exactly one characteristic pair of type (a, b) = (\u03c62s+1 , \u03c62s+5 ).\nThe curves Ps = 0 and Qs = 0 only meet at p. The rational pencil with only one base\npoint determined by the rational function Rs = (Ps )\u03c62s+1 /(Qs )\u03c62s+3 has only two special\nfibres Ps = 0 and Qs = 0, and the other fibres are rational unicuspidal plane curves of\ndegree \u03c62s+3 \u03c62s+1 = \u03c622s+2 + 1. The singularity of a generic fiber has one characteristic pair\n(a, b) = (\u03c622s+1 , \u03c622s+3 ).\nReferences\n[1] Fern\u00e1ndez de Bobadilla J., Luengo I., Melle-Hern\u00e1ndez A., N\u00e9methi A.: On rational cuspidal projective\nplane curves, preprint at arXiv:math.AG/0410611.\n[2] Dimca, A.: Singularities and Topology of Hypersurfaces, Universitext, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1992.\n[3] Fujita, T.: On the topology of non-complete algeraic surfaces, J.
