Ionization in liquid helium\nresults in the copious production of metastable He2 molecules, which can be detected by laserinduced fluorescence. Each molecule can be probed many times using a cycling transition, resulting\nin the detection of individual molecules with high signal to noise. This technique could be used\nto detect neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles, and ultracold neutrons, and to image\nsuperfluid flow in liquid 4 He.\nPACS numbers: 95.55.Vj, 29.40.Gx, 33.50.-j\n\nRenewed interest in superfluid helium as a particle detection medium has been spurred by proposals in lowbackground particle astrophysics (where superfluid helium has the advantage of extremely high radiopurity[1,\n2]) and tests of the Standard Model using ultracold neutrons (where superfluid helium is used as an ultracold\nneutron production and storage medium[3, 4]). This\npaper introduces an evolution of these experiments by\nadding a component of direct triplet He2 molecule detection through laser-induced fluorescence.\nExperiments in the 1950s and 1960s showed that superfluid helium scintillates brightly in the extreme ultraviolet when exposed to ionizing radiation[5], and\nthat large numbers of long-lived excitations are also\ncreated[6]. Detailed spectroscopy of electron-excited superfluid helium[7] later showed that both of these effects are due to the efficient production of He2 excimer\n3 +\nmolecules, particularly in the He2 (A1 \u03a3+\nu ) and He2 (a \u03a3u )\nstates which produce the scintillation and long-lived excitations respectively. It has been determined that more\nthan 50% of the energy of an energetic electron in liquid\nhelium is converted into chemical energy in the form of\nHe2 molecules, creating in total about 13000 He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu)\nand 19000 He2 (A1 \u03a3+\n)\nstates\nper\nMeV[8].\nElectroniu\ncally excited helium atoms are unstable in liquid helium,\nrapidly reacting with ground-state helium atoms. For\nexample, atoms in the 23 S state, which have a radiative\nlifetime of 8000 seconds in vacuum[9], only survive 15 \u03bcs\nin the liquid due to non-radiative bonding with ground\nstate atoms to form He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) molecules[10].\nWhile the lowest-energy singlet and triplet molecules\nboth emit 80 nm photons when they radiatively\ndecay[11], their radiative lifetimes are markedly different.\nThe He2 (A1 \u03a3+\nu ) has a lifetime of about 1 ns [12], while\nthe He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) has a lifetime of 13 \u00b1 2 s [13] in superfluid helium and forms a bubble of radius 5.3 \u00c5 [14].The\nphoton-emitting transition from He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) to the dissociative ground state, He2 (X 1 \u03a3+\n),\nis\nforbidden\nbecause\ng\nit requires a spin flip. A theoretical value of 18 s for\nthe lifetime of He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) in the lowest vibrational state\n\nhas been obtained by assuming the spin flip is driven\nby spin-orbit (SO) coupling and treating the Breit-Pauli\nspin-orbit Hamiltonian using first order perturbation theory [15]. The lifetimes of the lowest-energy triplet molecular states in neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are much\nshorter, measured to be 6.6 \u03bcs, 3.2 \u03bcs, 350 ns, and 50\nns respectively[16]. The large difference between the lifetimes of helium and the heavier noble gases is qualitatively due to the respective strengths of the SO coupling,\nwhich scales roughly as Z4 . In addition, the lowest energy\nexcited helium atom is in an S state, while the excited\nneon, argon, krypton, and xenon atoms are in P states.\nTherefore, the heavier noble gas molecules contain an intrinsic orbital angular momentum to contribute to the\nSO coupling that is lacking in helium molecules.\nThe metastable He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) molecule can also decay\nthrough reactions with other helium molecules[10] and\ncollisions with container walls. The movement of the\nmolecule is limited by diffusive scattering with rotons,\nphonons and 3 He impurities (see Figure 1). We model\nthe diffusion constant by the following equation:\nT7\nT\ne\u2212\u2206/T\n1\n+\n+X\n=\nD\n\u0393r\n\u0393p\n\u03933\n\n(1)\n\nwhere X is the relative concentration of 3 He in 4 He, and\n\u2206 is the roton energy gap (8.6 K). \u0393r , \u0393p , and \u03933 represent measures of the scattering of the He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) bubble\nwith rotons, phonons, and 3 He. \u0393r and \u03933 have been\ndetermined experimentally [17], while \u0393p has been scaled\nfrom an experimental value for phonon-3 He scattering by\ntaking into account the greater effective mass of the He2\nbubble[14, 18]. By adjusting the temperature and 3 He\nconcentration, the displacement of He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) over its\nradiative lifetime can be controlled, ranging from 0.7 cm\nto 40 m between 1 K and 100 mK.\nMany detailed spectroscopic studies of triplet He2\nmolecules in superfluid helium have been performed, and\nthe energy levels and optical absorption frequencies are\nwell established[7, 10, 19].

Also shown are the\nindividual roton and phonon contributions.\n\nHe2 molecule. The arrows on the diagram show a cycling transition that can be used to detect He2 molecules\nthrough laser-induced fluorescence. The scheme involves\ntwo pulsed infrared lasers. The first laser excites the\n3 +\nmolecule from a 3 \u03a3+\nu \u2192 c \u03a3g with a pulse of 910 nm\nlight. Immediately following is a second pulse to excite\n3 +\nthe molecules from c 3 \u03a3+\ng \u2192 d \u03a3u . Measured superfluid helium emission spectra indicate that this transition\nis at 1040 nm[10], though the absorption wavelength is\nexpected to be blue-shifted slightly from this value[7].\n3\nMolecules in the d 3 \u03a3+\nu then decay to the b \u03a0g with a\n90% branching ratio, emitting an easily detected photon\n3\nat 640 nm. The lifetime of the d 3 \u03a3+\nu \u2192 b \u03a0g transition has been measured to be 25 ns in both liquid[20]\nand gaseous[21] helium, demonstrating that there is little non-radiative quenching of the d 3 \u03a3+\nu state. Finally,\nthe b 3 \u03a0g state is non-radiatively quenched before it can\ndecay[7], returning to the a 3 \u03a3+\nu state where it is again\nsensitive to the probe laser. Thus a single triplet He2\nmolecule is capable of emitting as many as 4 \u00d7 107 pho3 +\ntons/s. Given that the cross section of the a 3 \u03a3+\nu \u2192 c \u03a3g\n\u221215\n2\ntransition in superfluid helium is 2.4 \u00d7 10\ncm [19] and\nassuming a comparable cross section for the c 3 \u03a3+\ng \u2192\n2\nd 3 \u03a3+\ntransition,\nlasers\nemitting\n250\n\u03bcJ/cm\npulses\nat\nu\n3 +\neach wavelength would drive the a 3 \u03a3+\n\u2192\nd\n\u03a3\ntranu\nu\nsition with roughly 90% efficiency per molecule. The\nlinewidth requirement for the pump lasers is not stringent because the transitions are broadened by about 120\ncm\u22121 by the liquid helium[19].\nBenderskii et al. have demonstrated that optical ex3\ncitation at 462 nm can drive the a 3 \u03a3+\nu \u2192 e \u03a0g tran3\nsition in superfluid helium. The e \u03a0g state then has\na high probability of non-radiatively decaying to the\nd 3 \u03a3+\nu state[20]. This gives another scheme for driving\n\nFIG. 2: Energy levels of the triplet He2 molecule below 21\neV. Also shown is the cycling transition described in the text.\n\nthe molecules to the d 3 \u03a3+\nu state, also resulting in the\nemission of 640 nm fluorescence. An advantage of this\nscheme is that only one laser is used. However, the blue\nexcitation light is more likely than infrared light to induce spurious fluorescence in any associated optical elements, which could interfere with the detection of 640\n3\nnm d 3 \u03a3+\nu \u2192 b \u03a0g fluorescence.\nWhen driving a cyclic transition in molecules, complications can arise from vibrational and rotational structure; if a large signal per molecule is needed, it would be\nundesirable to have molecules falling to a state in which\nthey are not sensitive to the optical excitation frequency.\nEltsov et al. have measured a vibrational relaxation time\nof 140 \u00b1 40 ms for a 3 \u03a3+\nu molecules in superfluid helium,\nand they demonstrated that the rotational relaxation is\nmuch faster [19]. From calculation of Franck-Condon factors for the cycling transition shown in Figure 2, we have\ndetermined that only 1.2% of the molecules per cycle will\nfall radiatively to the first vibrational state rather than\nthe zeroth vibrational state. If an experiment using this\ntechnique required the molecules to be cycled faster than\nthe maximum effective vibrational relaxation rate of 600\ns\u22121 , they can be repumped with a third laser operating\nat 1070 nm that would drive the molecules from a(1) to\nc(0) where they will decay to the a(0) approximately 95%\nof the time. This repumping of the molecules into the\nground vibrational state can be used to ensure that the\nmolecules are sensitive to the optical frequency chosen for\nthe cycling transition. In other experiments, it may be\ndesirable to cause molecules created by one ionizing radiation event to be undetectable during a following event.\nIn this case, the molecules can be driven into a different\nvibrational state where they will be blind to the pump\nlasers.\nA detector using individual helium molecule fluorescence in a cycling transition would be far more sensitive\nto small energy depositions than a comparable scintil-\n\n\f3\nlation detector. It should be possible to obtain usable\nsignal from every molecule formed in the detection region, whereas approaches using only prompt scintillation\ndetection have to contend with incomplete detector coverage, dark counts, and the inherently low quantum efficiency of photomultipliers (typically no better than 30%).\nDetection of individual molecules should allow an energy\nthreshold on the order of 100 eV for electron-like events,\nassuming that molecule production is linear with energy\ndeposition. Ionization in noble gases has been shown to\nbe roughly linear with energy deposition down to the 100\neV scale in neon and xenon gas[22], and we expect this\nalso to be the case in helium. Use of a cycling transition\nallows a significant signal amplification; the total photon production is roughly 13000 per MeV per cycle. In\ncomparison, organic scintillator typically produces 10000\nphotons per MeV.\nIn addition to having a very low energy threshold, a\ndetector incorporating laser-induced fluorescence for the\ndetection of He2 molecules can also have very good position resolution. Because the scheme shown in Figure 2\ncan only excite molecules where the beams overlap, one\ncan orient the two beams at 90 degrees to one another\nand raster them throughout the volume of interest. This\ncan lead to position resolution equal to or less than the\nradius of the laser beam profile. Alternately, it should be\npossible to image tracks in the superfluid helium using\nan image intensifying unit or CCD.\nWith the properties mentioned above, a detector using\nsuperfluid helium could be used in several different configurations. One mode of operation is a simple continuous\nscan of the detector volume to detect energy deposition\nevents. A second is to use a layer of wavelength shifting\nfluor[23] to convert the singlet He2 scintillation light to\nthe visible. The visible light would be detected by photomultipliers, triggering the laser scanning system. The\nlasers need only be activated following event detection,\nand some particle identification should be possible by\nmeasuring the ratio of prompt scintillation light to laserinduced fluorescence. In other liquified noble gases, this\nratio has been found to vary with excitation type[24, 25],\nwhich is likely the case in liquid helium as well[8]. In\naddition, requiring the detection of both prompt scintillation light and laser-induced fluorescence would allow\nthe rejection of backgrounds due to any interactions that\ndo not take place within the liquid helium. The disadvantage of this second mode is that the energy threshold will\nbe set by the efficiency of detecting the prompt scintillation light, while in the first mode the energy threshold is\nset by the amplified triplet molecule signal.\nThe projected low energy threshold provides a unique\nopportunity to search for the neutrino magnetic moment.\nThe differential cross-section for magnetic neutrino-\n\nelectron elastic scattering is given by\n(\n\n\u03c0\u03b12em \u03bc2l 1 \u2212 T /E\u03bd\nd\u03c3\n[\n)MS =\n]\ndT\nm2e\nT\n\nwhere \u03b1em is the fine structure constant, me is the electron mass, T is the kinetic energy of the recoil electron\nand E\u03bd is the neutrino energy[26]. Because this scattering process is enhanced for low T , tighter limits on\nthe neutrino magnetic moment \u03bcl can be set with a lowradioactivity detector that also has a low energy threshold. A radiopure sample of superfluid helium, scanned\nby infrared lasers and viewed by photodetectors, could\nhave an energy threshold as low as 100 eV. In addition, the very good position resolution available with this\ntechnique would assist in the characterization of systematic uncertainties. Gamma ray backgrounds from Compton scattering can be partially rejected by looking for\nmultiple scattering events in the detector volume, and\nx-ray backgrounds can be reduced by considering only\nevents that occur within the central region of the detector, where x-rays are unlikely to penetrate. To avoid\nsignificant He2 diffusion, and to avoid scattering of laser\nlight from bubbles in the liquid, this detector would be\nmaintained at a temperature slightly below the lambda\npoint, at roughly 2 K. The low energy threshold projected for this detector would also allow the detection of\ncoherent neutrino-nucleus scattering[27].\nLaser-induced fluorescence in superfluid helium may\nalso be useful in the search for dark matter in the form\nof weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The\nHERON group has demonstrated [28] that alpha particle excitations can result in a directional roton signal in\nsuperfluid helium. This occurs because the scattering\nrate of rotons within the track is much higher than the\nscattering rate of rotons once they leave, and the rotons\nare more likely to be emitted perpendicular to an elongated track than parallel to it. We speculate that the\ntrajectories of triplet molecules emerging from a spinindependent WIMP-nucleus scattering event in superfluid 4 He would also show this directional effect, and thus\nprovide information about the direction of the nuclear\nrecoil track. Like the rotons, the diffusion of molecules\nwithin the track would be dominated by roton scattering,\nand the triplet molecules should be preferentially emitted perpendicular to the track. The molecule trajectories could then be determined by a laser tracking system,\nand the pattern of molecule trajectories could be used\nto determine the direction of the initial nuclear recoil.\nWhile DRIFT [29] is promising for achieving directional\nsensitivity for WIMP-nucleus scattering events using a\nlow-pressure time projection chamber, superfluid helium\nwould allow a 105 times larger number density. Meyer\nand Sloan estimate that a nuclear recoil in 3 He (from a\nWIMP, for example) will result in 50% of the electronic\nexcitation that would be expected from an electron-like\nevent for a similar energy[30]. Assuming the same figure\n\n\f4\nfor 4 He, a nuclear recoil in superfluid helium will form 6.5\nHe2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) molecules per keV, allowing a very low energy\nthreshold. The same detector, filled with 3 He instead of\n4\nHe, could also be used to place limits on spin-dependent\nWIMP scattering, though in this case the much lower diffusion constant would preclude determination of the nuclear recoil direction because of scattering of the molecule\nafter it leaves the track.\nLaser-induced fluorescence may also be used to detect\nultracold neutrons in superfluid helium. In a currently\nproposed search for the neutron electric dipole moment\n(EDM) [4], He2 singlet light emission is to be used to\ndetect neutron absorption events in 3 He-doped superfluid\n4\nHe. These events in turn monitor the precession of spinpolarized neutrons. With the addition of laser-induced\nfluorescence, event by event detection of both the singlet\nand triplet molecules and measurement of the ratio of the\namplitudes of these two signals would allow the rejection\nof backgrounds associated with gamma ray scattering in\nthe liquid helium and light collection optics. Due to the\nlow temperature of the superfluid helium in the planned\nneutron EDM cells, the large He2 diffusion constant will\ncause any triplet molecules to be quenched by collisions\nwith the wall within about 3 ms. This is adequate time\nto cycle the triplet molecules multiple times with little\neffect from previous events, provided that the event rate\nis less than \u223c 100 s\u22121 . The same detection technique\ncould also be used in experiments to measure the neutron\nlifetime using magnetically trapped neutrons[3].\nA fascinating non-particle physics application of laserinduced fluorescence is the study of superfluid flow and\nturbulence. A small radioactive source, focused laser\nbeam, or electric discharge could be used to create triplet\nHe2 molecules that would then be tracked with intersecting lasers to image their path. One approach to imaging\nsuperfluid flow is neutron absorption tomography [31],\nwhich uses 3 He as a neutral tracer and requires a finely\ncollimated neutron beam and the ability to raster the\nneutron beam through the region of interest. By instead\nusing laser induced fluorescence of He2 (a 3 \u03a3+\nu ) molecules,\nmany of the same superfluid helium properties can be\nmeasured, with the advantages of better position resolution and imaging in three dimensions instead of only two.\nAnother method of imaging superfluid flow is particle image velocimetry with small (1-10 \u03bcm) neutrally buoyant\nglass beads[32], but this approach has so far been limited\nto temperatures above the lambda point.\nIn summary, we propose laser-induced fluorescence of\nmetastable He2 molecules as a technique for the detection\nof ionizing radiation with low energy threshold and good\nposition resolution. This appears useful for applications\nin neutrino physics, the search for WIMPs, ultracold neutron research, and the imaging of superfluid turbulence.\nWe thank R. L. Brooks, D. Budker, D.
