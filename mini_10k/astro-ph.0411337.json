These stars\nare probably the result of a late helium-shell flash that had occurred during their\nfirst descent from the AGB. The lack of hydrogen is caused by flash-induced\nenvelope mixing and burning of H in deeper regions. Now the former intershell matter is seen on the surface of the stars. Hence the stellar atmospheres\nshow metal abundances drastically different from the solar values. Our sample\ncomprises ten PG 1159 stars with effective temperatures between 85 000 K and\n170 000 K. We present first results of our spectral analysis based on FUV spectra\nobtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE).\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe are analysing FUSE spectra from ten PG 1159 stars and, in addition,\nthe hottest known DO white dwarf KPD 0005+5106, which we have obtained\nthrough own PI observations or from the MAST archive. They allow an independent investigation of the atmospheric parameters, which were previously\ndetermined from optical and/or HST UV spectroscopy, in some cases with low\nprecision. Table 1 summarizes the currently known parameters, as taken from\nliterature, which we use as a starting point for our analysis. Our plane-parallel\nstatic models used here are calculated with TMAP, the T\u00fcbingen NLTE Model\nAtmosphere Package (Werner et al. 2003, Rauch & Deetjen 2003).\n2.\n\nObservations and First Results\n\nIn Fig. 1 we display details of the FUSE spectra of our sample ordered by effective\nstellar temperature, beginning with the hottest object on the top. The FUV\nspectra of PG 1159 stars are dominated by lines from He II, C IV, and O VI.\nIn addition, several objects show S VI lines at 933.38 \u00c5 and 944.52 \u00c5. Miksa et\nal. (2002) detected sulfur in the spectra of PG 1159 stars for the first time by\nidentifying this resonance doublet in the FUSE spectrum of K 1-16. One of the\nstrongest absorption lines in the FUSE spectra, located at 973.3 \u00c5, remained\nunidentified until we found recently that it stems from Ne VII (Werner et al.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nReiff et al.\n\nFigure 1. Detail of FUSE spectra compared with models, except for\nHS 2324+3944. Some photospheric line identifications are given. Note the\nnewly identified Ne VII 973 \u00c5 line. Some stars show P Cyg profiles of the C III\nand O VI resonance lines, which are not fit by our static models. All other\nabsorption features which are not reproduced by our models are interstellar.\n\n\f3\n\nFUSE Spectroscopy of PG 1159 Stars\n\nrelative flux\n\nPV\nO VI\n\nO VI\n\nC IV\n\n0.5\n\nS VI ?\n\nF VI\n\nSi IV\n0.0\n\n1120\n\n1125\n\n1130\no\nwavelength / A\n\n1135\n\n1140\n\nFigure 2. First identification of phosphorus and silicon in a PG 1159 star\n(PG 1424+535). Note also the presence of a strong fluorine line (Werner et\nal. 2005), and possibly a sulfur line (the S VI resonance doublet is clearly\ndetected). The P, Si, and S lines are not included in the model, as well as the\nbroad C IV trough.\n\n2004a). This enables to determine the neon abundance, which is otherwise\ndifficult or impossible to do (Werner et al. 2004b). Another new identification\nis the detection of highly ionised fluorine lines (Werner et al. 2005). During the\ncourse of our current analysis we identified in addition for the first time lines\nfrom silicon and phosphorus (Si IV, P V), see Fig. 2. Abundance analyses from\nthese features are being performed.\n\nTable 1. Atmospheric parameters of our objects, taken from the literature.\nEB\u2212V was derived from our FUSE spectra.

This allows us to derive the interstellar reddening\nfrom the continuum shape. The results are listed in Table 1. The next step in\nour analysis will be to investigate the abundance dependences of the metal lines\nlines in order to fine-tune the atmospheric parameters.\nSome of our analysed objects, namely RX J2117.1+3412, K 1-16, Abell 78\nand NGC 7094, show P Cygni profiles of the C III and O VI resonance lines (see\nFig. 1). For three of these stars (RX J2117.1+3412, K 1-16 and NGC 7094) massloss rates and terminal velocities were determined in a former study by Koesterke\net al. (1998) based on HST spectra. Abell 78 has been investigated as well in\na recent analysis of FUSE and ORFEUS spectra by Herald & Bianchi (2004).\nMass-loss from these stars will be accounted for in our future analyses with\nexpanding atmosphere models.\nAcknowledgments.
