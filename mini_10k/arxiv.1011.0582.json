Due\nto the high resolution of our Nyquist-sampled images, the small photometric errors, and the depth of our data\n(the color-magnitude diagram of M32 goes as deep as F435W \u223c 28.5 at 50% completeness level) we obtain\nthe most detailed resolved photometric study of M32 yet. Deconvolution of HST images proves to be superior\nthan other standard methods to derive stellar photometry on extremely crowded HST images, as its photometric\nerrors are \u223c 2\u00d7 smaller than other methods tried.\nThe location of the strong red clump in the CMD suggests a mean age between 8 and 10 Gyr for [Fe/H] =\n\u22120.2 dex in M32. We detect for the first time a red giant branch bump and an asymptotic giant branch bump\nin M32 which, together with the red clump, allow us to constrain the age and metallicity of the dominant\npopulation in this region of M32. These features indicate that the mean age of M32's population at \u223c 20 from\nits center is between 5 and 10 Gyr. We see evidence of an intermediate-age population in M32 mainly due to the\npresence of asymptotic giant branch stars rising to MF555W \u223c \u22122.0. Our detection of a blue component of stars\n(blue plume) may indicate for the first time the presence of a young stellar population, with ages of the order\nof 0.5 Gyr, in our M32 field. However, it is likely that the brighter stars of this blue plume belong to the disk of\nM31 rather than to M32. The fainter stars populating the blue plume indicate the presence of stars not younger\nthan 1 Gyr and/or blue straggler stars in M32. The CMD of M32 displays a wide color distribution of red giant\nbranch stars indicating an intrinsic spread in metallicity with a peak at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.2. There is not a noticeable\npresence of blue horizontal branch stars, suggesting that an ancient population with [Fe/H] < \u22121.3 does not\nsignificantly contribute to the light or mass of M32 in our observed fields. M32's dominant population of 8\u201310\nGyr implies a formation redshift of 1 . z f . 2, precisely when observations of the specific star formation rates\nand models of \"downsizing\" imply galaxies of M32's mass ought to be forming their stars. Our CMD therefore\nprovides a \"ground-truth\" of downsizing scenarios at z = 0.\nOur background field data represent the deepest optical observations yet of the inner disk and bulge of M31.\nIts CMD exhibits a broad color spread of red giant stars indicative of its metallicity range with a peak at\n[Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.4 dex, slightly more metal-poor than M32 in our fields. The observed blue plume consists of stars\nas young as 0.3 Gyr, in agreement with previous works on the disk of M31. The detection of bright AGB stars\nreveals the presence of intermediate-age population in M31, which is however less significant than that in M32\nat our field's location.\nSubject headings: Local Group - galaxies: individual: M32, M31 - galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD -\ngalaxies: stellar content\n1. INTRODUCTION\nElectronic address: monachesi@astro.rug.nl\n1 Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated\nby the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under\nNASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with GO\n\nproposal 10572.\n2 The National Optical Astronomy Observatory is operated by AURA,\nInc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\f2\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nElliptical galaxies contain the oldest stars in the Universe,\nand the study of their composition provides a means of studying the evolution of the Universe to large look-back times.\nMoreover, they represent at least 50% of the total stellar mass\nin the local Universe (Schechter & Dressler 1987; Gallazzi\net al. 2008). Understanding their formation and evolution is\ncrucial to understand galaxy formation and evolution in general.\nThe study of the resolved stellar content in galaxies is a key\ntool to reach this goal. Stars have the imprint of evolutionary parameters such as age and metallicity and thus provide\na fossil record of the star formation history (SFH) and evolution of a galaxy. We can derive the complete SFH of a\ngalaxy by means of deep and accurate color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), given that the most direct information about\nany stellar population comes from applying stellar evolution\ntheory to CMDs. Specifically, the direct observation of the\noldest galaxy's main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) is necessary\nfor an accurate determination of its age and thus its SFH.\nThanks to the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST), launched in 1990, stellar populations in spirals and\ndwarf galaxies in the Local Group can now be resolved with\ngreat accuracy, allowing a precise determination of complete\nSFHs with an age resolution of \u223c 1 Gyr for ages larger than\n10 Gyr (see e.g., Brown et al. 2006; Barker et al. 2007; Cole\n& The Lcid Team 2007). Unfortunately, the large distances\nto giant ellipticals, in combination with their high surface\nbrightnesses, prevents detection of their intrinsically fainter\nindividual stars, limiting knowledge about their stellar populations (although there have been studies of the resolved giants near the tip of the red giant branch in nearby ellipticals:\nsee, e.g., Sakai et al. 1997; Harris et al. 1999; Gregg et al.\n2004; Rejkuba et al. 2005). As a consequence, most elliptical\ngalaxies can only be studied by the spectra of their integrated\nlight which possess contributions from all their stars, having a\nrange of metallicities and ages. This makes the unambiguous\ndisentanglement of the age and metallicity of a stellar population difficult, especially in old populations such as those\nthat dominate the masses of elliptical galaxies. Stellar population models have been developed to derive SFH of ellipticals\n(e.g. Worthey 1994; Rose 1994) based on moderate-resolution\nspectra (e.g. Gonz\u00e1lez 1993; Coelho et al. 2009). These models have become very sophisticated in disentangling the nontrivial age and metallicity degeneracy. However, they still suffer several uncertainties and there is a pressing need for them\nto be tested with direct observations of stars in an elliptical\ngalaxy.\n1.1. M32: A window on the stellar populations of elliptical\n\ngalaxies\nThe Local Group galaxy Messier 32 (M32) is a small satellite of M31 and the nearest elliptical galaxy. It is classified\nas a compact elliptical (cE) galaxy, cE2, due to its low luminosity, compactness and high surface brightness (Bender et al.\n1992). M32 is the prototype of this class of ellipticals, consisting of \u223c 20 galaxies known so far (Davidge 1991; Ziegler\n& Bender 1998; Chilingarian et al. 2009), the so-called M32like galaxies. Despite the fact that M32 has been extensively\nobserved and studied, its SFH and therefore its origins are\nstill a matter of debate. The proposed models for M32's origins span a wide range of hypotheses: from a true elliptical\ngalaxy at the lower extreme of the mass sequence (e.g., Faber\n1973; Nieto & Prugniel 1987; Kormendy et al. 2009) to an\nearly-type spiral galaxy whose concentrated bulge, unlike its\n\ndisk, still survives to the tidal stripping process caused by its\ninteractions with M31 (e.g., Bekki et al. 2001; Chilingarian\net al. 2009).\nNevertheless, M32 is today an elliptical galaxy and the\nnearest system that has properties very similar to the giant\nellipticals: it falls at the lower luminosity end of all of the\nstructural and spectroscopy scaling relations of giant ellipticals: the Faber\u2013Jackson relation (e.g., Faber & Jackson 1976),\nthe Kormendy relation (e.g., Kormendy 1985), the mass\u2013\nage\u2013metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe]\u2013mass relationships (Trager et al.\n2000a), and the Mg\u2013\u03c3 relation and the Fundamental Plane\nof early-type galaxies (e.g., Bender et al. 1992). More recently, Kormendy et al. (2009) find that both central and\nglobal parameter correlations from recent accurate photometry of galaxies in the Virgo cluster place M32 as a normal,\nlow-luminosity elliptical galaxy in all regards3 .\nGiven its proximity, M32 provides a unique window on the\nstellar composition of elliptical galaxies, since it can be studied by both its integrated spectrum and the photometry of its\nresolved stars. While we note that the SFH of a low luminosity elliptical such as M32 (reff \u2248 4000 , Choi et al. 2002;\nKormendy et al. 2009) may differ from those of giant ellipticals, it is a fact that in general models applied to giant ellipticals reach the same conclusions as those applied to M32 (e.g.,\nWorthey 1998). M32 is therefore a vital laboratory to test the\napplicability of the stellar population models to more distant\ngalaxies.\n1.2. Integrated light studies of M32\n\nFrom spectroscopic studies, one of the most important results of synthetic population models was found by O'Connell\n(1980): models fail to reproduce M32 with a single old-age\nand solar-metallicity population. Various synthetic population models have claimed that M32 underwent a period of\nsignificant star formation in the recent past, i.e. about 5\u2013\n8 Gyr ago, (e.g., O'Connell 1980; Pickles 1985; Bica et al.\n1990) based on the presence of enhanced H\u03b2 absorption in\nthe integrated spectrum of M32, and thus indicate signatures\nof an intermediate luminosity-weighted age population (e.g.,\nRose 1994; Trager et al. 2000a; Worthey 2004; Schiavon et al.\n2004; Rose et al. 2005; Coelho et al. 2009). Rose et al. (2005)\nstudied the nuclear spectrum of M32 and found radial gradients in both the age and metallicity of the light-weighted\nmean stellar population of M32: the population at 1reff is \u223c 3\nGyr older and more metal poor by \u223c \u22120.25 dex than the central population, which has a luminosity-weighted age of \u223c 4\nGyr and [Fe/H]\u223c 0.0. Extrapolation of the spatially resolved\nspectroscopy of Gonz\u00e1lez (1993) results in an average age\nand metallicity of M32 at 10 from its center of 8 Gyr old and\n[Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.25 (Trager et al. 2000a). This is consistent with\na more recent estimate by Worthey (2004) who found the age\nof M32 at 10 to be 10 Gyr old. The most recent results from\nstellar population models are given by Coelho et al. (2009)\nwho observed high signal-to-noise spectra at three different\n3 Graham (2002) has claimed that M32 has a disk, based on the ability to\nfit its brightness profile as a bulge plus exponential disk. The location of our\nfield F1 would correspond to a region where both the disk and bulge should\nequally contribute to the light under this model. However, his bulge plus disk\nfit is not a unique decomposition. Kormendy et al. (2009) fit a Sersic profile\nto the SB of M32 with n = 2.8, which places M32 at the low-luminosity end\nof normal ellipticals. They interpret the light in the center of M32 that was\nnot fit by their Sersic profile (which was also not fit by Graham) as a signature\nof formation in dissipative mergers. Extra central light is a general feature of\ncoreless galaxies and is observed in all the other low-luminosity ellipticals of\nKormendy et al.'s sample.\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\nradii, from the nucleus of M32 out to \u223c 20 from the center\nof M32. They propose that an ancient and intermediate-age\npopulations are both present in M32 and that the contribution\nfrom the intermediate population is larger at the nuclear region. They claim that a young population is present at all radii\n(see also e.g., Trager et al. 2000a; Rose 1985, 1994; Schiavon\net al. 2004), but its origin is unclear. Moreover, the determination of ages in integrated spectra is a difficult problem, as\nextended horizontal branch morphologies and/or blue stragglers, unaccounted for in the models, can mimic younger ages\n(e.g., Burstein et al. 1984; Rose 1985; de Freitas Pacheco &\nBarbuy 1995; Maraston & Thomas 2000; Trager et al. 2005).\nThus, lacking any direct evidence for such a young population\n(ages < 1 Gyr), and due to the uncertainties in the synthesis\nmodels, these results should be considered with some caution.\n1.3. Individual stars studies of M32\nOn the other hand, photometric studies of resolved stars\nhave supported the existence of an intermediate-age population (e.g. Freedman 1992a; Davidge & Jensen 2007) by detecting AGB stars suggestive of a \u223c 3 Gyr old population.\nHowever, observations by Davidge & Jensen (2007), obtained\nwith the NIRI imager on the Gemini North telescope, do not\nsupport spectroscopic studies that find an age gradient in M32,\nsince they suggest that the AGB stars and their progenitors\nare smoothly mixed throughout the main body of the galaxy.\nBrown et al. (2000, 2008), using ultraviolet observations of\nthe center of M32, and Fiorentino et al. (2010), using the\nACS/HRC data presented here, have found evidence of an\nancient, metal-poor population by observing blue horizontal branch and RR Lyrae stars, respectively. Worthey et al.\n(2004), using optical observations obtained with the Wide\nField Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on board HST and presented by Alonso-Garc\u00eda et al. (2004), studied the stellar populations of the outer regions of M32 and M31 and found that\nthere is no trace of a main sequence younger than \u223c 1 Gyr in\nM32 at a region 7reff from its center. The most extensive study\nof the resolved stellar populations of M32 has been carried out\nby Grillmair et al. (1996, hereafter G96), who resolved individual stars down to slightly below the level of the HB with\nthe HST WFPC2 in a region of 1\u201320 from the center of the\ngalaxy. Their most important result is the composite nature\nof the CMD of M32. They concluded that the wide spread\nin color of the giant stars in their CMD cannot be explained\nonly by a spread in age but rather by a wide spread in metallicity. However, given the age\u2013metallicity degeneracy on the\ngiant branch, there may well be a mixture of ages present in\ntheir field, but age effects are less important than metallicity on the giant branch morphology. For an assumed age of\n8.5 Gyr old, the metallicity distribution function has a peak at\n[Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.25, consistent with the extrapolation made from\nthe spatially resolved spectroscopy of Gonz\u00e1lez (1993). The\nspread in metallicity found by G96 ranges from roughly solar\nto below \u22121 dex. This study, as well as those by Brown et\nal., Alonso-Garcia et al. and Worthey et al., concluded that\nthe metal-poor population is insignificant, contrary to the results of Coelho et al. (2009). Finally, a young population of\n. 1 Gyr claimed by several population models to be present\nin the spectrum of M32 has not been seen by any of the observations of resolved stars. Overall, the photometric studies\ncarried out so far only obtained information from the brighter\nstars of M32, i.e., the upper CMD. These studies were prevented from observing fainter stars by the extreme crowding\nof M32. Since upper giant-branch tracks are degenerate in\n\n3\n\nage and metallicity, much like integrated colors and metallic\nlines, it is not possible to derive an age from the upper CMD\nalone.\nThe only way to derive the SFH of M32 and test conclusions so far based solely on integrated colors and spectral indices is to obtain deep CMDs that reach the MSTO of M32.\nMeasuring the position of the blue turnoff stars with accurate\nphotometry is the only evidence to test the ages inferred from\npopulation synthesis models. A deep CMD and luminosity\nfunction of M32 can be used as the basis for spectral synthesis studies. An agreement between observed and synthetic\nindices for M32 would confirm such indices as simple diagnostic tools for constraining stellar populations in integrated\nlight of other elliptical galaxies, for which only the integrated\nlight is available, given their greater distances. Moreover the\nCMD allows for the study of spreads about mean properties in\na way that is currently impossible with integrated light. These\nspreads are as important as the mean values in decoding the\nSFH of the galaxy.\nIn order to further investigate the stellar content of M32,\nand with the primary goal of deriving a complete SFH of this\nenigmatic galaxy, we were awarded 64 orbits of the HST to\nobserve the MSTO of M32 with the High-Resolution Channel (HRC) at the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The\nproximity of M32, combined with the high resolution of HST\nACS/HRC allows for a remarkable improvement in our study\nof its stellar content. In this paper, we introduce our new\nobservations and present the deepest optical CMD so far obtained. The CMD presented here reaches more than 2 magnitudes fainter than the previous optical CMD by G96 and fully\nresolves the red giant branch (RGB) and the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). We report the discovery of a blue plume\n(BP), consisting of young stars and/or blue straggler stars, not\nclaimed to have been observed before. We also detect for the\nfirst time in M32 a RGB bump and an AGB bump. By analyzing our CMD we have achieved the most comprehensive\nphotometric study of the resolved stellar content of M32. A\nfollow-up paper will present the recent and intermediate SFH\nof M32 that can be derived from these data. In addition, as\ndiscussed above, these data have already been analyzed by\nFiorentino et al. (2010, hereafter F10) to study RR Lyrae variables in our fields.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our\nobservations and the reduction of the data. The photometry performed and the extensive study of completeness and\ncrowding of the data are presented in Section 3. Section 4\npresents the decontamination of the M32 field from the light\ncontribution by M31. The analysis of the CMD of M32 and\nits luminosity function is presented in Section 5. We derive\nthe distance to M32 and M31 is Section 6. In Section 7 we\nanalyze the M31 stellar populations in our background field.\nWe summarize our findings in Section 8.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n2.1. Field Selection and Observational Strategy\n\nWe obtained deep B and V -band imaging of two fields near\nM32 using the ACS/HRC instrument on board HST during\nCycle 14 (Program GO-10572, PI: Lauer). The ACS F435W\n(B) and F555W (V ) filters were selected to optimize detection\nof MSTO stars over the redder and more luminous stars of the\ngiant branch. M32 is very compact and is projected against\nthe disk of M31. The major challenge was to select a field that\nrepresented the best compromise between the extreme crowd-\n\n\f4\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\ning in M32, which would drive the field to be placed as far\naway from the center of the galaxy as possible, versus maximizing the contrast of M32 against the M31 background populations, which would push the field back towards the central,\nbright portions of M32. Following these constraints, the M32\nHRC field (designated F1) was centered on a location 11000\nsouth (the anti-M31 direction) of the M32 nucleus, roughly on\nthe major axis of the galaxy. The V -band surface brightness\nof M32 near the center of the field is \u03bcV \u2248 21.9 (Kormendy\net al. 2009). M32 quickly becomes too crowded to resolve\nfaint stars at radii closer to the center, while the galaxy rapidly\nfalls below the M31 background at larger radii.\nEven at the location of F1, M31 contributes \u223c 1/3 of the\ntotal light with inner disk and bulge stars (K. Howley, private\ncomm.), thus it was critical to obtain a background field, F2,\nat the same isophotal level in M31 (\u03bcV \u2248 22.7) to allow for the\nstrong M31 contamination to be subtracted from the analysis\nof the M32 stellar population. F2, which also contains both inner disk and bulge M31 stars (K. Howley, private comm.), was\nlocated 32700 from the M32 nucleus at position angle 65\u25e6 . At\nthis angular distance M32 has an ellipticity of \u000f \u2248 0.25 (Choi\net al. 2002) and F2 is nearly aligned with M32's minor axis.\nThus the implied semi-major axis of the M32 isophote that\npasses through F2 is 43500 , significantly larger than the nominal angular separation. The estimated M32 surface brightness\nat F2 is \u03bcV \u2248 27.5, based on a modest extrapolation of the Bband surface photometry of Choi et al. (2002) and an assumed\ncolor of B \u2212V \u2248 0.9. The contribution of M32 to F2 thus falls\nby a factor of \u223c 180 relative to its surface brightness at F1.\nWhile one might have been tempted to move F2 even further\naway from F1, it clearly serves as an adequate background\nat the location selected, while uncertainties in the M31 background would increase at larger angular offsets. The locations\nof both fields are shown in Figure 1.\nDetection of the MSTO required deep exposures at F1. Accurate treatment of the background required equally deep exposures to be obtained in F2. A summary of the observations\nis shown in in Table 1; briefly, each field was observed for\n16 orbits in each of the F435W and F555W filters for a total\nprogram of 64 orbits.\nAt B, and even V , HRC undersamples the PSF, despite its\nexceptionally fine pixel scale. All of the images were obtained in a 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 sub-pixel square dither pattern to obtain\nNyquist sampling in the complete data set. In detail, the subpixel dither pattern was executed across each pair of orbits,\nwith each orbit split into two sub-exposures. The telescope\nwas then offset by 0.00 125 steps between the orbit pairs in a\n\"square-spiral\" dither pattern of maximum extent \u00b15 pixels\nto minimize the effects of \"hot pixels,\" bad columns, and any\nother fixed-defects in the CCD, on the photometry at any location. The data for each filter/field combination thus comprises\n8 slightly different pointings, with Nyquist-sampling obtained\nat each location.\nIn addition to the HRC images, parallel observations were\nobtained with the ACS/WFC channel using the F606W filter\n(broad V ). Those images have been analyzed by Sarajedini\net al. (2009), who find 324 and 357 RR Lyrae variables stars\nin the parallel fields associated with F1 and F2, respectively.\n2.2. Image Reduction, Stacking, and Upsampling\nAs outlined above, the data set for each of the four filter/field combinations comprises 32 exposures with nonredundant pointings. The images were combined in an iterative procedure designed to detect and repair cosmic-ray\n\nevents, hot pixels, and other defects, with a Nyquist-sampled\nsummed image as the final product.\nThe first reduction step was to interlace the four images at\neach position within the larger square-spiral dither pattern into\na rough Nyquist image at that position. In practice, the subpixel dithers were accurate to < 0.00 01, so a simple interlace\nworked reasonably well for the initial reduction. For this first\nstep, cosmic rays in one of the four images could be repaired\nby interpolation among the three remaining frames. The resulting eight Nyquist images were then shifted to a common\ncentroid using sinc-interpolation (which does not smooth the\ndata), and added to produce an initial stack. At this point\nthe stack still contained artifacts from coincident cosmic-ray\nevents within each of the eight subgroups, as well as hot pixels; although both types of artifacts are reduced in amplitude\nby the averaging implicit in the larger dither pattern.\nThe second reduction cycle used the initial Nyquist\nsummed-image to then re-identify and repair cosmic-ray hits\nin each of the 32 raw images. Hot pixels were also identified and repaired at this stage by finding coincident events\nin detector, rather than celestial, coordinates. At this point\na higher quality Nyquist summed-image was generated by\ncombining all 32 images (trimmed to their common area) using the Fourier algorithm of Lauer (1999). This algorithm\nproduces a summed image with double the native HRC pixel\nscale, by combining the images in the Fourier domain to eliminate aliased power from the under-sampled source images.\nThe algorithm has no adjustable parameters, approximations,\nand so on, and important for the present application, induces\nno smoothing or degradation of the PSF.\nThe final reduction cycle was just to repeat the second cycle, but using the output from the second cycle as the input for\nthe detection and repair of cosmic-ray events and hot pixels.\nThe final summed image is thus essentially free of artifacts.\nAs it eliminates the undersampling in the HRC, which provides the finest pixel scale of all HST instruments to begin\nwith, it represents one of the highest-resolution images obtained with the observatory, given the blue-bands selected for\nthe observations.\nThe final image still contains the geometric field distortion\ninherent to the HRC. Since the image is Nyquist-sampled,\nit can be rectified using sinc-interpolation, given the STScI\ntwo-dimensional polynomial representations of the distortion,\nwithout incurring degradation of the PSF. The required correction can be done by multiplying the image by the appropriate pixel area map (PAM). We construct a PAM image4 for\nthe HRC which has a size of 2048\u00d72048 pixels, as this is the\nsize of each combined image. The PAM is expressed in units\nof the pixel scale corresponding to our combined image, i.e.,\nhalf of the native HRC scale, and it has an approximate value\nof \u223c 1.12 near the image center. We correct each combined\nimage as follows:\nCORRECTEDflux = COMBINEDflux \u00d7 PAM\n\n(1)\n\nThe combined images of F1 and F2 fields used for analysis\nthus have a pixel scale of 0.00 0125 and a resolution of \u223c 0.00 05\nfor point sources. They are shown in the top (F1) and bottom\n(F2) panels of Figure 2, in the F555W filter, from which the\nstrong crowding in these fields is clearly seen. There is how4 We have downloaded the script example as well as the coefficients\nfiles which are needed for the PAM image construction from the web page\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/PAMS.

Each field covers\na region of 26 \u00d7 29 arcsec2 on the sky. The field F1 is located at 11000 from the nucleus of M32 and represents the best compromise between minimizing image\ncrowding and contamination from M31. The F2 field is at the same isophotal level in M31 corresponding to the location of the F1 field. Thirty-two exposures\nin each of the F435W (B) and F555W (V ) filters were taken for each field. The location of fields F3, F4, F5 and F6 is also shown in blue. They are archival\nHST/WFPC2 fields near M32 that were analyzed in the Appendix to investigate the presence of a \"blue plume\".

The arrow in the\ntop panel indicates the direction towards the center of M32.\n3. PHOTOMETRY\n\nThe traditional method for extracting stellar photometry in\ncrowded fields uses standard stellar photometry packages, e.g.\nDAOPHOT II (Stetson 1987), which are specifically designed\nfor this problem. This approach is favored over direct deconvolution of the PSF from the images, as HST images in general are undersampled, and deconvolution treats the artifacts\ndue to aliasing as genuine sources (see Holtzman et al. 1991),\nresulting in large photometric errors. In the present case, how-\n\never, the Nyquist-sampled and high-S/N summed images are\nfree from artifacts. This motivated a re-examination of using\ngeneral-purpose PSF deconvolution to mitigate the extreme\ncrowding in the images, which we did in parallel to reducing the images with DAOPHOT II. To our delight, the deconvolved photometry is superior to that done with DAOPHOT,\na conclusion based both on the sharpness of features in the\nCMDs derived from the images and extensive artificial star\ntests. We present derivation of stellar photometry using both\nmethods in this section, showing why we decide in the end to\nsolely use the deconvolved photometry for the analysis of the\nCMD.\n\n\f6\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 2.- Combined images of the 32 F555W exposures in the F1 (top panel) and F2 (bottom panel) fields displayed with the same linear stretch. Each image\nhas a size of 2048\u00d72048 pixels with a 0.00 0125 pixel scale. There is a clear difference in stellar density between the images. This difference indicates that\nthe crowding is more severe in F1 than in F2 field. We also note a stellar density gradient in the F1 image, becoming higher when approaching the center of\nM32, whose direction is indicated by the arrow in the top panel. The long white spot in the top center of each image is the occulting finger of the ACS/HRC\ncoronagraph.\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n3.1. DECONVOLVED IMAGE photometry\nThe final summed images of F1 and F2 were deconvolved\nusing the Lucy-Richardson algorithm (Lucy 1974; Richardson 1972). The PSFs for the F435W and F555W images\nwere constructed interactively and iteratively by summing the\nbrightest relatively isolated stars in the images to produce ad\nhoc PSFs, which were then used to clean out the fainter stars\nin the wings of the PSF stars, resulting in improved PSFs,\nwhich were then used to refine the PSFs further. In all steps\nof the process, sinc-function interpolation was used to shift\nthe PSFs and their component stars as needed.\nThe Lucy-Richardson algorithm works iteratively, quickly\nremoving the \"wings\" of the PSFs, but taking considerably\nlonger to enhance structure on the scale of the central diffraction cores. In the present case, we used 640 iterations on\nthe F555W images and 160 iterations on the F435W images.\nThis heavy level of deconvolution nearly transforms the images into a set of delta functions, but in doing so serves to\nsplit closely blended stars; pairs of stars as close as \u223c 0.00 03\nwere separated. Due to its higher S/N, stars were identified\nin the F555W , while the F435W image provided fluxes at\nthe position of the identified stars. Stars were identified by a\nsimple peak-finding algorithm. We had no formally-derived\ncriterion for the threshold used to identify peaks. Instead,\nwe examined faint sources in relatively isolated regions and\nadopted a single threshold for a given image that roughly separated what appeared to be real stars from noise fluctuations.\nIn practice, the real depth of the photometry was established\nby the artificial star tests (ASTs) described after this section.\nWe measured the stellar fluxes as follows. After the central\npixel of the source was identified in the F555W deconvolved\nimage, we summed the counts within a 3 \u00d7 3-pixel box centered at this position. The positions of the stars identified in\nthe F555W deconvolved image are used to find the stars in the\nF435W deconvolved image. We measured the fluxes in the\nF435W deconvolved in the same way, summing the counts\nwithin a 3 \u00d7 3-pixel box around the central pixel of the source\nin the F435W deconvolved image. All these steps were performed using algorithms running in the XVISTA package5 .\nThe catalog of each field was cleaned of stars located in the\nborders, and in the occulting finger of the image. The final\nnumber of stars obtained with the deconvolution process is\nindicated in Table 2.\nThe deconvolved magnitudes needed to be corrected for a\nsmall non-linearity in the deconvolved flux. This is due to the\nfact that the fraction of flux in the box defined to measure the\nflux varies slightly with flux. We generated a correction table\nfrom simulated deconvolutions on a constant-sky level image.\nStars were injected with appropriate Poisson noise as a function of flux. For each 0.2 step in magnitude we generated 16\nstars per simulation and recover them performing the deconvolution in the same way as was done with the real stars. The\ncorrection is rather small (less than 0.1 mag) and only affects\nthe magnitudes of some of the stars. Stars at both the brighter\nand fainter end are not affected by this small non-linearity.\nIn order to transform the instrumental magnitudes of the\nstars into apparent magnitudes, they need to be corrected for\ntwo effects that reduce the measured stellar flux: charge transfer efficiency (CTE) and aperture correction.\nCharge Transfer Efficiency (CTE): Charge lost due to imperfect electron transfers from pixel to pixel and then to the\n5\n\nhttp://ganymede.nmsu.edu/holtz/xvista/\n\n7\n\nreadout amplifier degrades the photometry. Due to the gradual\ndegradation of ACS after its installation in 2002, the effects of\nCTE are noticeable. The correction needed for ACS/HRC is\ngiven in the ACS Data Handbook:\n\u2206mag = 10A \u00d7 SKYB \u00d7 FLUXC \u00d7\n\nY\n\u00d7\n2000\n(MJD \u2212 52333)\n365\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A = \u22120.44 \u00b1 0.05, B = \u22120.15 \u00b1 0.02 and C = \u22120.36 \u00b1\n0.01 are the most recent coefficients (Chiaberge et al. 2009).\nIn this formula, SKY is the sky level in electrons measured\nnear the star, FLUX is the flux of the star in electrons, Y is the\nnumber of transfers which, when the default amplifier C has\nbeen used for readout as in our case, is simply the y coordinate of the star. Finally, the images used to obtain the stellar\nmagnitudes are constructed using images with very similar\nexposure times. Therefore, the SKY and FLUX values in the\nformula should be divided by the number of images used. The\n\u2206mag for each star is subtracted from its measured magnitude. Values of \u2206mag vary from 0.001 to 0.1.\nAperture Correction: The PSFs used for the deconvolution\nhave limited extent stellar wings in order to avoid as much as\npossible the contamination by neighboring stars. Hence, the\ncontribution of the flux in the large extent of the stellar wings\nneed to be added to the measured magnitudes. The standard\nprocedure to perform this correction consists of obtaining the\nflux for a small number of bright and isolated stars within a\n0.00 5 aperture radius, after all resolved stars \u2013 except those to\nbe measured \u2013 have been removed. The median value of the\ndifferences between the magnitudes obtained from this flux\nand the one measured is the aperture correction (Stetson &\nHarris 1988). This correction is then applied to all of the star\nmagnitudes. After this step, the correction from 0.00 5 to \"infinite\" is made using the tables in Sirianni et al. (2005). In\nour case, such bright and isolated stars are unavailable because the field is so crowded. Moreover, even if we could find\nsome bright isolated stars, we would need to subtract an enormous number of stars from the image. The residuals from the\nPSF-fitting of all those subtracted stars will remain, adding\nfluctuations to the image and therefore significant errors to\nthe photometric measurements. For these reasons we have\ndecided to use the encircled energies (EE) which have been\ntabulated by Sirianni et al. (2005) and provide the fraction of\nthe total source count as a function of the aperture radius, instead of the usual method. At each PSF radius, we calculate\nthe fraction of flux that is missing and add this to the magnitudes. These values differ in each filter band and they are\nlisted in Table 2 as well as the PSF radius used for the deconvolution, for each filter/field combination. We are aware that\nthe aperture corrections calculated with the EE should only be\napplied to the photometric data for aperture radii larger than\n10 pixels in the original HRC image, and therefore 20 pixels\nin our combined images. This was only the case for one of the\nPSFs we have obtained. However, due to the issues explained\nabove, we have no other way to correct by aperture correction\nwithout introducing significant errors.\nFinally, if \u03bb is the bandpass in the ACS/HRC system, the\napparent magnitudes map are transformed into the VEGAmag\nsystem using the zero points 36.73 and 36.80 for F435W and\nF555W respectively, which were obtained as follows:\nZP(\u03bb) = 2.5 log[texp (\u03bb)] + ZPVEGAmag(\u03bb)\n\n(3)\n\n\f8\n\nMonachesi et al.\nin the above section.

DAOPHOT photometry\n\nWe also performed stellar photometry with the standard\nDAOPHOT II and ALLSTAR packages (Stetson 1987, 1994)\nto compare with the photometry obtained from deconvolved\nimages.\nWe first built a PSF for each combined image from bright\nand as isolated as possible stars in each field of view (FoV).\nThis was done iteratively using the PSF routine of DAOPHOT\nII. The number of stars that finally remain to construct the\nPSF is about 50 per image. After testing various PSF models,\nwe adopted a \"Penny\" function (a sum of a Gaussian and a\nLorentz function) as the best analytical model for all the images, according to the Chi value calculated by the PSF routine.\nWe adopted a PSF that varies quadratically with position.\nWe performed PSF-fitting photometry on the images using\nALLSTAR. The procedure was applied to a list of star candidates obtained from a DAOPHOT routine, from which concentric aperture photometry was performed to obtain crude\napparent magnitude estimates and sky determination for all\nthe objects found. Due to the severe crowding, the procedure\nof finding star-like objects, concentric aperture photometry\nand profile-fitting photometry was performed 3 times in order to both find the faint stars and improve the photometry on\nthe bright stars. After this procedure we had four ALLSTAR\noutput lists, one for each filter on each field, from which we\nretain only the objects having a statistically good photometry.\nWe made use of the Chi value, sharpness index, and magnitude errors given by ALLSTAR to eliminate possible false\nphotometric detections, e.g. background galaxies, unrecognized blends or cosmic rays. An extra step was performed and\nwe cleaned each list of stars located both at the edge of the image, i.e. those stars having image coordinates X or Y either\n< 23 or > 2023, and in the occulting finger of the ACS/HRC\nCCD, for which the magnitudes were poorly determined.\nWe then used the DAOMATCH and DAOMASTER algorithms (Stetson 1994) to correlate the output list from the\nF435W filter with the output list from the F555W filter. This\ncreated a combined star catalog. An object was considered\nto be a star if it is found in both filters (F435W and F555W )\nwithin a distance of 2 pixels. The final number of stars that\nwe obtained for each field is listed in Table 2.\nThe last step consisted of applying the CTE and aperture\ncorrections to obtain the apparent magnitudes in the VEGAmag system. This was done in exactly the same way explained\n6\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/zeropoints\n\n3.3. Comparison of the two photometric methods\nTo compare the two photometric lists, we first directly\nexamine the CMD obtained from the deconvolved images\nwith that obtained from the photometry performed using\nDAOPHOT. Figure 3 shows the deconvolved (left panel) and\nDAOPHOT (right panel) CMDs obtained for field F1. The\nsame but for F2 is shown in Figure 4. We see that the deconvolved CMDs look better, as they produce notably clearer\nfeatures at all luminosities. All of the features described in\nSection 5 are much sharper and better defined, and the outliers to the red of the RGB (F435W \u2212F555W > 1.5, F555W =\n25\u201327.5) are greatly reduced. In addition, a visual inspection of the subtracted images reveals that deconvolution does\na considerably better job in resolving blended stars. Furthermore, we compared the results given by the ASTs (see Section 3.4 for a detailed description) using deconvolved images\nwith that obtained using DAOPHOT. Figure 5 shows, in the\ntop panel, the differences between the recovered and injected\nmagnitudes obtained using deconvolved images (red dots) and\nDAOPHOT photometry (black dots), as a function of the injected magnitudes. The bottom panel shows the mean error\nof these differences as a function of injected magnitudes. For\nclarity, only the results of the same 10 ASTs (i.e. 20,000 injected stars analyzed) are shown. We can see that there is\nmuch more scatter in the DAOPHOT-recovered magnitudes at\nall magnitude levels; this is especially clear at the bright end.\nAs shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5, the deconvolved\nphotometry results in smaller errors than DAOPHOT. All this\nindicates that the photometry performed on the deconvolved\nimages is superior to that obtained using DAOPHOT.\nFinally, we have also compared the list of stars obtained\nfrom both methods by cross-correlating them using DAOMATCH and DAOMASTER. The number of matched stars\nbetween deconvolved and DAOPHOT photometry was \u223c\n32, 000 for field F1 and \u223c 17, 000 for field F2. Figure 6 shows\nthe differences between the apparent magnitudes in both photometric results as a function of the deconvolved magnitudes.\nWe find that there is an almost constant shift between the\nmagnitudes of the matched stars, especially in the F555W filter, such that the deconvolved photometry produces systematically brighter magnitudes. To investigate the cause of this\ntrend, we compare the PSFs used to deconvolve the images\nwith the ones obtained using DAOPHOT and we found that\nthe DAOPHOT PSFs have small wings or none at all. Due\nto the severe crowding in our fields, we could only generate\nreliable PSFs with very small radii, using DAOPHOT, which\nare essentially devoid of wings7 . We therefore believe that\nthe PSFs constructed to deconvolve the images are more reliable and therefore so is the photometry based on the deconvolved images8 . Nevertheless, if we correct for the shifts in\n7 PSFs constructed with larger radii produced larger Chi values, given the\nlarge effects of neighboring stars on determination of the wings.\n8 We have also compared the deconvolved and DAOPHOT photometry\nwith that obtained using DOLPHOT (a version of HSTphot Dolphin 2000,\ntailored to work on ACS images) on our individual images. This comparison\nshows that, at the RC level, there is good agreement between DOLPHOT's\nmagnitudes and those obtained with the deconvolved images. This suggests\nagain that the photometry obtained from deconvolved images is reliable. The\nphotometry performed using DOLPHOT is explained in F10 where it was\nused to search for RR Lyrae variable stars.\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\n9\n\nF IG . 3.- (F435W \u2212 F555W , F555W ) CMDs of field F1 obtained from the deconvolution (left-hand panel) and DAOPHOT (right-hand panel) photometry.\nThey contain 58,143 and 50,583 stars respectively, and are calibrated onto the VEGAmag HST system. We can see that features in the deconvolved CMD are\nmore clearly delineated than in the DAOPHOT CMD, at all luminosities. All of the features described in Section 5 are much sharper and better defined, e.g. the\nRGB and RC. Moreover, the outliers to the red of the RGB (F435W \u2212 F555W > 1.5, F555W = 25\u201327.5) are greatly reduced in the deconvolved CMD when\ncompared with DAOPHOT. We therefore only use the deconvolved CMD for further analysis. See text for more details.\n\nmagnitudes, Figure 6 shows that both photometric methods\nagree well for F555W < 27 and F435W < 27. However at\nF555W > 27 and F435W > 27 the differences become significant. Looking at the locations of stars at these faint magnitudes, it appears that most of the sources are probably products of blends. Note that the detection limit in the deconvolved images is determined below to be at F555W \u223c 28.\nDue to all the above reasons, we are convinced that deconvolution, which has not been previously used to derive stellar\nphotometry, gives remarkably better results than the standard\n\nphotometric packages for these extremely crowded HST images. We therefore use the CMDs and the list of stars from the\ndeconvolved images for further analysis. Figure 7 shows the\nF1 (left panel) and F2 (right panel) deconvolved error-based\nHess diagrams with a logarithmic stretch, where the features\nare better highlighted. The error-based Hess diagrams represent relative density of stars weighted by their photometric errors as follows. Each star is represented by an elliptical\ngaussian with color and magnitude widths as a function of its\ncolor and magnitude photometric errors given by the ASTs\n\n\f10\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 4.- Same as Figure 3 but for field F2.\n\n(see next subsection). The color-magnitude image containing\nall these elliptical gaussians has been split into 600\u00d7600 bins.\nNote that the two CMDs show a surprisingly similar morphology. We return to this point in Section 7.\n3.4. Completeness tests and error analysis\n\nWhen analyzing the data and before any detailed interpretation, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the\ncompleteness of the CMD as a function of both magnitude\nand color. The major source of incompleteness here is crowding, which is the most important limitation to the analysis of\nrich stellar fields. The well-known method of artificial stars\n(Stetson & Harris 1988) is the best way to quantify its effects.\nSince the crowding effects are different for the F1 and the F2\n\nfields, due to the differences in stellar density (Figure 2), such\nASTs need to be carried out in each field separately to reach\nstatistically significant results for both. The generation of artificial stars was done following the prescriptions introduced\nby Gallart et al. (1996) and using the IAC-STAR code (Aparicio & Gallart 2004). This code generates synthetic CMDs\nby means of interpolation in the metallicity and age grid of\na library of stellar evolutionary tracks. This interpolation results in a smooth distribution of stars following a given star\nformation rate, initial mass function and chemical enrichment\nlaw. In order to apply the AST method it is important that the\nmagnitudes and colors assigned to the artificial stars are realistic, covering a range as wide as the populated one by the real\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\nF IG . 5.- Comparison of 10 ASTs results from deconvolved images (red\ndots) and DAOPHOT photometry (black dots).

Errors are greatly reduced in the deconvolved photometry when compared with DAOPHOT.\n\nstars to fully sample the observed colors and magnitudes. It\nis important that the injected stars have realistic colors to test\nfor color effects. We generated a synthetic CMD of 500,000\nartificial stars adopting a constant star formation rate with\nages from 0 to 14 Gyr, and metallicities 0.0001 < Z < 0.04\nuniformly distributed at all ages. We have chosen a limiting magnitude for the synthetic stars of about two magnitudes\nfainter than the fainter stars observed in our CMD, to explore\nthe possibility of recovering a very faint, unresolvable artificial star as if it were much brighter. The synthetic CMDs\ngiven by IAC-STAR are expressed in a photometric magnitude system different than the ACS/HRC photometric system.\nIn particular we have chosen the bolometric correction library\nfrom Origlia & Leitherer (2000), which has magnitudes in the\nHST WFPC2 system. We therefore have transformed those\nmagnitudes into the ACS/HRC photometric system using the\ntransformation given by Sirianni et al. (2005). Since the artificial stars need to be injected into the images, the synthetic\nCMD needs to be transformed to instrumental magnitudes.\nHence we have converted the absolute magnitudes given by\nthe synthetic CMDs into apparent magnitudes using a distance modulus of \u03bc0 = 24.43 (Ajhar et al. 1996), a reddening\nof E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08 (Burstein & Heiles 1982), and an extinction of AF555W = 0.25 (Sirianni et al. 2005). We have then\napplied the photometric corrections in reverse order to obtain\nthe artificial stars onto the raw magnitude system. The artificial stars are placed into the images with random pixel locations using the PHOTONS routine in XVISTA. The number\nof artificial stars injected per experiment should not be larger\nthan about 5% of the real stars found in the images (see e.g.\nGrillmair et al. 1996a; Fuentes-Carrera et al. 2008) to avoid a\nsignificant increase of the (already extreme) crowding in the\n\n11\n\nF IG . 6.- Difference between stars found using deconvolved images and the\nones found by DAOPHOT II as a function of the deconvolved apparent magnitudes. On the two top panels we show the differences in the F555W filter\n(left-hand panel: F1, right-hand panel: F2) and on the two bottom panels we\nshow the same but in the F435W filter (left-hand panel: F1, right-hand panel:\nF2). Here \u2206mag = magDECONVOLVED \u2212 magDAOPHOT . There is a constant\nshift between the deconvolved and DAOPHOT magnitudes that we attribute\nto a difference in the PSFs, considering deconvolution to be a more reliable\nmethod. Apart from the shift, there is however a reasonable good agreement\nbetween the two photometric methods for magnitudes . 27.5. The photometric results have little to do with each other for fainter magnitudes (see text\nfor more details). Magnitudes are calibrated onto the VEGAmag photometric\nsystem.\n\nimages. We have used 2,000 artificial stars per AST. Once\nthe artificial stars are placed into the images, photometry was\nperformed using deconvolved images as before, since it is the\ndeconvolved photometry that we use for the CMD analysis.\nThe reduction of the original and artificial images must be\ncarried out identically for the comparison to be valid. A second requirement for a valid AST is that the reductions should\nbe performed without knowing which stars in the synthetic\nframe are added and which are real. For each AST we obtain\na deconvolved photometry list as output file. Then, we append the file containing the injected positions and magnitudes\nof the artificial stars to the output file from the original photometry of real stars. Next we match this appended file with\nthe star list of the artificial image. This provides us with a list\nof recovered stars, i.e., injected stars that are paired with stars\nfrom the artificial stars subset. The matching is done with\nDAOMATCH and DAOMASTER using the two star lists as\ntwo lists to be matched. Stars within 1 pixel of radius distance are considered to be recovered. This process has been\nrepeated as many times as necessary in each image in order\nto achieve a very large number of artificial stars analyzed and\nto recover a number of stars similar to the one of real stars in\nthe image. In this way, we can statistically sample the whole\nCMD diagram, both in magnitude and color indices. In total\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 105 stars have been used to perform \u223c 250 ASTs on\neach image. The procedure is applied to both filters of each\nfield, i.e. F1 and F2.\nA comparison between the number of injected and recovered artificial stars provides information about the crowding\neffects on the photometry and gives us the completeness level\nof our data. We define the completeness factor as the fraction\n\n\f12\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 7.- (F435W \u2212 F555W , F555W ) CMDs obtained from image deconvolution of F1 (left panel) and F2 (right panel) in an error-based Hess representation\nwith a logarithmic stretch, where features are better highlighted.

The data were divided for this calculation into 20 bins\nin both magnitude and color. Figure 8 shows the completeness fractions obtained for both the F1 and F2 fields. The\ncolor bar in these figures indicates the values of the completeness fraction level, increasing from 0 to 1, where 1 represents 100% completeness. The magnitudes in these figures\nare expressed in the VEGAmag system. The 50% completeness level for F1 is located at F555W \u223c 28 (F435W \u223c 28.5)\nindependent of color. Our completeness factor falls rapidly\nto zero below F555W \u223c 28, suggesting a limiting magnitude\nF555Wlim \u223c 28. The 50% completeness level for F2 is half\na magnitude deeper, at F555W \u223c 28.5, indicating again that\nthis field is slightly less crowded.\nThe actual photometric errors are quantified as the difference in magnitude between the recovered and injected stars,\n\nshown in Figure 9 for F1. In this figure the difference\n\u03b4mag = magrecovered \u2212 maginjected is plotted as a function of the\ninjected magnitudes in both F555W (left-hand panels) and\nF435W (right-hand panels) filters. The completeness fractions as a function of magnitude are plotted in the bottom\npanels of the same figure. The median of the magnitude differences is negligible for magnitudes having more than 70%\ncompleteness. We see from these figures that the magnitudes\nof some recovered stars differ significantly from their input\nmagnitudes, having significantly negative \u03b4mag < \u22121 (i.e. recovered brighter). The appearance of aberrant stars coincides\nwith the dramatic drop in the completeness at F555W \u223c 28.\nThese might be stars that were only detected because they are\nlocated at noise spikes. We therefore do not consider stars\nwith magnitudes that lie below our 50% completeness level as\nrecovered. Photometric errors are defined for a given bin of\nmagnitude i and color j as the errors in the median of the magnitude differences in that bin. We show in Figure 10 the amplitude of photometric errors throughout the theoretical CMD\nlocus of the M32 stars. Our photometry shows excellent accuracy for magnitudes F555W < 26.5 and the mean errors in\nmagnitude and color are \u223c 0.18 mag and \u223c 0.23 mag, respectively at the 50% completeness level.\nWe want to emphasize that a same AST analysis was addi-\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\n13\n\nF IG . 8.- Completeness fractions for fields F1 (left-hand panel) and F2 (right-hand panel) as a function of apparent F555W magnitudes and (F435W \u2212 F555W )\ncolors.

As shown in Figure 5,\nwe have obtained larger photometric errors with DAOPHOT\nphotometry and much more scatter in recovered magnitudes.\nThus, the ASTs were also used to prove quantitatively that the\ndeconvolved photometry is superior than DAOPHOT.\n4. M32 FIELD DECONTAMINATION\n4.1. M31 contamination\n\nM31 is clearly the dominant source of contamination in our\nM32 field (F1). M32 lies at a projected distance of 5.3 kpc\nsouth of the center of M31 and therefore contamination from\nits disk and bulge is significant. Moreover, at the position in\nwhich the F1 field was taken, the closest possible to the center\nof M32 without being overwhelmed by crowding effects, one\nthird of the light is coming from M31. To correct for this statistically, we have also obtained images of a comparison field\nlocated at the same isophotal level within M31. As explained\nin previous sections, those images were processed in the same\nway as the F1 images.\nSince both fields are located at the same isophotal level in\nM31, correcting for M31 stars would require that for each F2\nstar we subtract the closest one in color and magnitude from\nthe F1 star list. However, as we have already addressed in\nprevious section, the crowding differs between the two fields.\nImage crowding is more important for F1 than for F2 so there\nare different levels of completeness in the images that should\nbe taken into account. We therefore cannot simply subtract the\nF2 stars from the F1 CMD in a \"one-by-one\" way. Instead, the\nnumber of stars removed from F1 depends on the completeness fractions computed at F1 and F2 fields (e.g., Gallart et al.\n1996). Assuming that the population of M31 stars is statistically the same in both the F1 and F2 fields, we corrected the\nF1 CMD as follows: For each F2 star of magnitude i and color\nj an ellipse was defined in the F1 CMD centered at i, j and\nwith semi axes erri and err j . The semi-axes correspond to\n\n\u039bF1\ni, j\n,\n\u039bF2\ni, j\n\n(5)\n\nF2\nand \u039bF1\ni, j and \u039bi, j are the corresponding completeness factors\nfor F1 and F2 in the i, j bin of the CMD (Gallart et al. 1996),\nas previously calculated. The closest integer to Fn is chosen as\nthe number of stars to be subtracted. If the number of stars in\na given ellipse is smaller than the number of stars expected\nto be removed, we enlarge the semi-axes of the ellipse by\na factor of two. The remaining stars are deleted from this\nlarger ellipse in order of proximity to the color and magnitude of the F2 field star considered. This happens most often in regions of the CMD where the density of stars is low.\nThe advantage of this process (Gallart et al. 1996) is that the\nregion in magnitude and color from where the stars are removed varies along the CMD, i.e. the interval in magnitude\nand colors from which stars are removed is changing size depending on the photometric errors. Thus, brighter stars \u2013 the\nones with smaller photometric errors \u2013 are subtracted from a\nsmall region around the field star in the CMD, whereas the\nfainter stars, and therefore the ones with larger photometric\nerrors, are allowed to be removed from a larger region of the\nF1 CMD with a size controlled by the error.\nWe show in Figure 11 the F1 CMD decontaminated from\nthe M31 background stars. The 50% completeness level is\nalso shown in this Figure. The number of M32 stars remaining\nafter this decontamination process is \u223c 26000 of the 58143\noriginally detected in F1 (Table 2).\n\n4.2. Galactic foreground stars\nOur field F1 is quite small, and the contamination by the\nGalactic foreground stars is very small. We have however\nstill estimated it from star count data. The Besan\u00e7on group\nmodel of stellar population synthesis of the Galaxy (Robin\net al. 2003) predicts the amount of stars in a given magnitude interval for a given location. This model predicts 14\nforeground Galactic stars in the range of V = 22 \u2212 30 in our\n\u223c 29 arcsec2 ACS/HRC field. This is of course negligible\ncompared with the thousands of stars we have obtained in\nour photometric catalog, and therefore we do not consider\nforeground stars further in our analysis.\n5. THE STELLAR POPULATIONS OF M32\n\nThe CMD we have obtained is deep enough to allow a comprehensive study of the stellar populations of M32, and we\ncan gain some insights into them by comparing our CMD\nwith theoretical isochrones. In what follows we present the\nmost detailed resolved photometric study of M32 carried out\nso far. Figure 12 shows the CMD of M32 with boxes highlighting features that reveal the different stellar populations.\nWe see evidence for an intermediate-age and old population \u2013\nages between 2 and 10 Gyr \u2013 due to the presence of a strong\nred clump, an extended and bright asymptotic giant branch, a\nprominent red giant branch, and the red giant branch bump as\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\n15\n\nF IG . 11.- Left panel: CMD of M32, corrected for contamination by the M31 background stars. The different crowding levels between the F1 images and the\nF2 images were taken into account to statistically perform the decontamination (see text for more description). Right panel: Error-based Hess representation of\nthe decontaminated CMD of M32, where the features are better highlighted. To construct this Hess diagram, the stars were replaced by elliptical gaussians with\ncolor and magnitude photometric errors as color and magnitude gaussian widths, respectively. The CMD was then divided into 600\u00d7600 bins. In both panels,\nthe dashed line indicates the 50% completeness level of our data. Apparent magnitudes are calibrated onto the VEGAmag ACS/HRC system.\n\nwell as the asymptotic giant branch bump. We also see possibly evidence of a young population \u2013 ages younger than 2\nGyr \u2013 due to the presence of stars occupying the blue plume\nproducing an extended main sequence, blue loop stars, and\na possible bright subgiant branch. Evidence of an ancient \u2013\nolder than 10 Gyr \u2013 population could be represented by blue\nhorizontal branch stars together with a well-populated red giant branch. Note that a well-defined blue horizontal branch in\nour CMD is not present, but we have observed RR Lyrae stars\nin F1 (F10) and there are stars in the region where we would\nexpect to see blue horizontal branch stars. We emphasize here\nthat all these features are above the 80% completeness level\nwhere the photometric errors are very small. Hence what we\nsee in the CMD at this level represents the intrinsic properties of the stars. Note in Figure 12 that, although we have\nthe highest resolution and deepest data for M32 yet obtained,\nthe severe crowding of our fields makes it impossible to reach\nthe oldest main-sequence turn-offs. This unfortunately will\nremain a challenge beyond existing telescopes and even nearfuture space-telescopes such as JWST.\nIn the following, we discuss the different stellar populations\nof M32 in detail. We assume a distance modulus (DM) of \u03bc0 =\n24.53 (this paper, below), Galactic reddening E(B \u2212V ) = 0.08\n(Burstein & Heiles 1982), and extinction AF555W = 0.25 (Sirianni et al. 2005). Note that we have only considered Galactic reddening, on the assumption that M32 is dust-free. We\nnote that no dust features are seen in the surface photometry\nresidual maps of the M32 center (Lauer et al. 1998) or envelope (Choi et al. 2002). F10 tested for internal extinction\nin F1 and F2 due to M31 and/or M32 by using the intrinsic\nproperties of the RR Lyrae variables in the fields. They found\n\nthat the mean reddening values obtained in both fields agree\nwithin the errors and are further consistent with the assumed\nGalactic reddening. We also tested for differential extinction\nover the HRC field by comparing the RGB colors of CMDs\nconstructed at different quadrants of the image and found no\ndifference. We use theoretical isochrones from the Padova library (Marigo et al. 2008; Girardi et al. 2002, 2008) as they\nare available in the HST ACS/HRC photometric system at different ages and metallicities. The metallicity in these models\nassumes [M/H] = log(Z/Z ), Z = 0.019, and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0.\nAlthough our photometry could be transformed onto traditional magnitude systems (e.g., Johnson\u2013Cousins) for comparison to other theoretical isochrones, such transformations\nalways introduce significant systematic errors (Sirianni et al.\n2005) and we prefer to stay as much as possible in the original\nphotometric system of the data.\n5.1.

The Red Clump (RC)\n\nThe most prominent feature in our CMD is the RC formed\nmostly by the reddest low-mass stars burning helium in their\ncores9 . A strong RC, as we see here, indicates the presence of\nintermediate-age/old metal-rich stars. Models of core-helium\nburning stars predict that the RC luminosity depends on both\nage and metallicity (Cole 1998; Girardi et al. 1998). For\na given metallicity, old stars form a fainter RC than young\nstars whereas for a given age, lower metallicity stars form a\n9 The bottom part of the blue loop (core-He-burning intermediate-mass\nstars, see below) also contributes to this RC.\n\n\f16\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 12.- Error-based Hess diagram for M32, corrected for contamination by the M31 background stars.

For a population of known age and metallicity,\nthe RC is at a fairly constant color and luminosity, hence these\nstars can serve as good standard candles to derive distances\nboth within our own Galaxy and to nearby galaxies and globular clusters (Percival & Salaris 2003). We make use of this\nfact to derive the distance to M32 in Section 6.\nWe now attempt to estimate a mean age and metallicity of\nM32, based on the constraints that the presence of this feature\nimpose. Constraints on age and metallicity of these populations can be obtained from the analysis of the locus and width\nof the red giant branch (RGB) together with the position of\nthe RC (Ferguson & Johnson 2001; Rejkuba et al. 2005).\nWe begin by measuring the mean luminosity and color\nof the RC.

A non-linear least-squares fit of this\nfunction to the histogram of stars in the clump region provides\nF555Wm and \u03c3RC . We show in the top panel of Figure 13 the\nstars inside the box that were selected to determine the mean\napparent magnitude of the RC in our field. In the lower lefthand panel of the same figure we show the histogram of the\nmagnitudes of those RC stars together with the fit. We can see\nthat the data are well fit by this function. The mean color of\nthe RC is calculated using the same formalism (lower righthand panel of Figure 13) and its value, as well as the mean\nmagnitude of the RC, is listed in Table 3. Models by Marigo\net al. (2008) and Girardi et al. (2008) suggest, for the observed\nmean magnitude and color of the RC, a mean age of M32 of\n8\u201310 Gyr for a metallicity Z = 0.012 ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.2 dex, see\nSection 5.1.3) consistent with the bulk of the stellar population being old.\nThere are uncertainties in this estimate: The mean magnitude and color of the RC are also well fit with a mean stellar\npopulation of 5 Gyr and solar metallicity Z = 0.019, reflecting\nthe age-metallicity degeneracy that occurs in the RGB. Moreover, the uncertainties in the distance modulus obtained (see\nbelow) could modify these parameters, possibly changing the\nmean age by \u00b12 Gyr.\n5.1.2.

We observe a bluer and brighter end of the RC, at\nF435W \u2212 F555W \u223c 0.75, which indicates the presence of lower metallicity stars in combination with young stars at the bottom of the blue loop. The\nred end of the RC, at F435W \u2212 F555W \u223c 1.30, is fainter, which indicates\nthe presence of both older ages and higher metallicities stars.

The coefficients found for this fit with 95% confidence bounds are F555Wm = 25.66\nand \u03c3 = 0.082. In the right-hand panel we show the fit to the histogram of the\ncolor distribution of RC stars. The same formalism was used in this case and\nwe obtain (F435W \u2212 F555W )m = 1.20 and \u03c3 = 0.088.\n\nAs stated above, the RC's morphology depends not only on\nthe metallicity but also on the age of the stellar system. In\nthis case we observe a bluer and brighter end of the RC,\nat F435W \u2212 F555W \u223c 0.75, which indicates the presence of\nlower metallicity stars and young intermediate-mass stars at\nthe bottom of the blue loop (see next subsection). The red end\nof the RC, at F435W \u2212 F555W \u223c 1.30, is fainter, indicating\nthe presence of both older ages and higher metallicities stars.\nWe will quantitatively study the complex morphology of the\nRC when deriving the SFH of M32 in a follow-up paper. We\nmake a histogram of the luminosity of these stars and measure\nthe peak magnitude of the RC by fitting the F555W -band luminosity function with the following function from Paczynski\n& Stanek (1998),\nN(F555W ) = a + b(F555W \u2212 F555Wm )+\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n\u0015\n\nm)\nNRC \u2212 (F555W2\u03c3\u2212F555W\n2\nRC\ne\n, (6)\nc(F555W \u2212 F555Wm ) +\nd\na Gaussian representing the RC population plus terms repre-\n\n2\n\nWe detect for the first time in M32 a feature in the RGB that\nwe identify as the RGB bump (RGBb) located at F555W \u223c\n26.10 (see Figure 12). This feature is the consequence of the\nfollowing process that occurs at the beginning of the RGB\nphase. During evolution along the RGB, the H-burning shell\nmoves away from the core of the star, which is increasing in\nluminosity at almost constant temperature. As the shell moves\nout to regions of 'fresh' hydrogen it encounters the chemical\ndiscontinuity left behind by the maximum penetration of the\nconvective envelope. When this happens, the rate at which\nthe star climbs the RGB drops for a short period and even\nreverses for a while, until the shell adapts to the new environment, and then the star again increases its luminosity, burning\nin a regime of constant H content. As a result, the star crosses\nthe same small portion of the RGB evolutionary path -the\nsame luminosity interval- three times, producing a peak in\nthe luminosity function (Iben 1968; Sweigart & Gross 1978;\nKing et al. 1985; Renzini & Fusi Pecci 1988). The time that\na low mass star spends during the RGBb phase is a considerable fraction (\u223c 20%) of the total RGB lifetime, and the\nRGBb can be easily observed in an intermediate-age or old\nstellar system provided there is a large number of stars. Stellar evolution models predict that the brightness of this feature\ndepends on both the age and metallicity of the system. For\na given metallicity old stars have a lower RGBb luminosity\nthan young stars (Alves & Sarajedini 1999, hereafter AS99).\nWe calculate the mean magnitude of the RGBb by fitting\na Gaussian plus a quadratic function to the F555W -band luminosity function around the bump (Figure 14). The bin size\nof the distribution is 0.1 mag, since this is the approximate\nmean photometric error in this region of the CMD. The mean\ncolor of the RGBb was obtained by fitting a Gaussian to the\ncolor distribution around the bump; the inferred value and its\nstandard deviation are listed in Table 3. We can estimate the\nsignificance of this bump by comparing the number of RGB\nbackground stars (i.e. the quadratic component of the fit) with\n\n\f18\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 14.- Left-hand panel: A Gaussian plus a quadratic fit to the F555W band luminosity around the RGB bump. A number of 1370 stars lie in this\nregion. The peak is at F555W = 26.21 and \u03c3 = 0.10. The bin size of the\nluminosity function is 0.1 mag, since this is the approximate mean value of\nthe photometric errors in that region of the CMD. From this fit, we find that\nthe RGB bump is a 5\u20138\u03c3 detection. Right-hand panel: A Gaussian plus a\nstraight line fit to the histogram of stars in the AGB bump region. The peak is\nat F555W = 24.87 and \u03c3 = 0.09. A number of 372 stars lie in the region. Note\nhere that the bin size of the histogram is 0.03 mag, given that the photometric\nerrors are negligible at these color and magnitude levels. The ABG bump is\na 4\u20137\u03c3 detection.\n\nthe number of stars that are in the bump (the Gaussian component of the fit). There are 1127 \u00b1 34 RGB background stars,\nwhere the error is simply Poisson error. The number of remaining stars that are in the RGB bump is 219 \u00b1 51. Thus,\nthe RGB bump is a 5\u20138\u03c3 detection.\nWe also detect for the first time in M32 the asymptotic giant branch bump (AGBb), a bump in the Hess diagram at the\nbeginning of the AGB phase. Here a process analogous to\nthe one at the beginning of the RGB phase occurs related to\nthe formation of the He-burning shell (Caputo et al. 1989;\nFusi Pecci et al. 1990; Sarajedini & Forrester 1995; Gallart\n1998; Ferraro et al. 1999). As a consequence a feature similar to the RGBb is seen. In this case, the He-exhausted core\ncontracts rapidly and heats up, and the H-rich envelope expands (the luminosity increases) and cools so effectively that\nthe H-burning shell extinguishes, causing the base of the convective envelope to penetrate inward again. Eventually, the\nexpansion of the envelope is stopped by its own cooling and\nit re-contracts. Therefore the luminosity decreases and the\nmatter at the base of the convective envelope heats up. When\nthe H-burning shell reignites, the envelope convection moves\noutward in radius ahead of the H-burning shell, and the luminosity increases again. As a consequence of this process the\nstar will cross the same luminosity interval three times, and\nan increase of star counts in this luminosity interval is therefore predicted. There is, like for the RGBb, a good probability\nof observing this feature in intermediate-age or old systems,\nprovided that they are well-populated enough to detect such\na fluctuation. AS99 and Cassisi et al. (2001) have shown that\nthe luminosity of the AGBb is a function of the mean age and\nmetallicity of the stellar populations generating this feature.\nWe identify the clump of stars seen at F555W \u223c 24.80 with\nthe AGBb. To obtain the mean luminosity value of this bump,\nwe fit a Gaussian plus a straight line to the F555W -band luminosity function around it (Figure 14). Note that, in this case,\nthe bin size of the distribution (0.03 mag) is smaller than the\none used for the luminosity function around the RGBb. This\nis consistent with the fact that the photometric errors are negligible in that region of the CMD. A Gaussian was fit to the\ncolor distribution around the bump to obtain its mean color.\nThe mean luminosity and color inferred from these fits are\nlisted in Table 3. We can estimate the significance of the AGB\nbump in the same way as we did for the RGB bump: we find\nthat the number of stars in the background is 265 \u00b1 16 and the\n\nnumber of stars in the bump is 85 \u00b1 25. This implies that the\nAGB bump is detected at the 4\u20137\u03c3 level.\nAS99 presented values of the magnitude difference between the RGBb and RC ([\u2206V (RGBb-RC)]) as well as between the AGBb and the RC ([\u2206V (AGBb-RC)]) for four\nGalactic globular clusters: M5, NGC 1261, NGC 2808, and\n47 Tuc. They showed that predictions of theoretical models are in good agreement with the ages, metallicities and\n[\u2206V (AGBb/RGBb-RC)] values of these clusters. These predictions can be used as a consistency check on our age and\nmetallicity determinations. It is important to note here that\nthe measurement of [\u2206V (AGBb/RGBb-RC)] is distance independent.\nUsing the predictions presented in AS99, the magnitude of\nthe RC of M32 in F1, located between the brighter AGBb and\nthe fainter RGBb, strongly indicates that populations older\nthan 2.5 Gyr and metallicities higher than about \u22120.7 dex\ndominate in our field (see Table 2 and Figure 4 in AS99). To\nobtain more quantitative information, we use of the mean luminosities of the AGBb and RGBb listed in Table 3. We then\ntransform these magnitudes onto the Johnson-Cousins photometric system using Sirianni et al. (2005) calibrations, as the\nmodels by AS99 are given on that photometric system, and we\ncalculate the differences between the AGBb and RGBb mean\nmagnitudes and the mean magnitude of the RC. These values\nare also indicated in Table 3. Given the AGBb-RC magnitude\ndifference, Figure 6 of AS99 suggests that M32 metallicity is\nlikely to be higher than [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.4 dex regardless of age.\nHowever since their models do not extend to more metal-rich\nregimes, it is difficult to obtain a tighter constraint. Nevertheless we confirm the metal-rich nature of the stellar population\nin M32. On the other hand, if we assume such a metal-rich\npopulation, the RGBb-RC magnitude difference suggests (see\nFigure 6 of AS99) that the mean age of M32 is likely to be in\nbetween 5 and 10 Gyr, consistent with the value found above\nfrom the RC alone.\n5.1.3. The RGB: The metallicity distribution of stars in M32\n\nThe Red Giant Branch (RGB) in our CMD at F555W .\n26.75 and 0.75 . (F435W \u2212 F555W ) . 1.50 is the evolutionary phase where stars are burning H in a shell while He has\nnot yet been ignited in their cores. The lifetime of a star on\nthe RGB is a decreasing function of its initial mass, hence\nthe probability of observing low mass stars in this phase is\nvery high. The color and morphology of the RGB for a stellar system strongly depend on its metallicity. On the other\nhand, for a given metallicity, the RGB moves to the red as a\nstellar population ages. Although the age dependence of the\nRGB color is not as strong as its metallicity dependence, an\nage\u2013metallicity degeneracy certainly exists on the RGB.\nFigure 12 shows that the RGB has a rather wide spread in\ncolor. Given the small (almost negligible) photometric errors\nat these magnitude and color levels, this cannot be explained\nby a single-age and -metallicity population but rather by an\nintrinsic large spread in the metallicity distribution. We show\nin Figure 15 that a population with a single age and a range of\nmetallicities can adequately reproduce the width of the RGB.\nIn spite of this, some age spread cannot be excluded. This is\nin agreement with G96 who showed that the spread in color\nof the M32 CMD is indicative of its metallicity range.\nFigure 15 shows isochrones superimposed on the CMD of\nM32 corrected for reddening (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08, Burstein &\nHeiles 1982), extinction (AF555W = 0.25, Sirianni et al. 2005)\nand distance \u03bc0 = 24.53 (this paper below), that represent pop-\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\nF IG . 15.- CMD of M32 corrected for contamination by M31 background stars, reddening (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08, Burstein & Heiles 1982), extinction (AF555W = 0.25, Sirianni et al. 2005) and distance \u03bc0 = 24.53, which\nwas obtained using the RCS method (see text for description). Isochrones\nfrom Marigo et al. (2008) and Girardi et al. (2008) are superimposed with\nmetallicities of Z = 0.0008,0.008, and 0.030 for ages of 2 (solid), 5 (dashed)\nand 9 (triangles) Gyr. Note a good match with the features that represent an\nintermediate-age population. Note also that the width of the RGB cannot be\nexplained with a single metallicity and, even though a single age with a spread\nin metallicity could reproduce this, we cannot exclude some age spread.\n\nulations of 2 (solid lines), 5 (dashed lines) and 9 (triangles)\nGyr with metallicities of Z = 0.0008 (bluest), 0.008, and 0.03\n(reddest). We can see that these isochrones cover the entire\nRGB and match the features we just discussed. However it is\nclear that not all of them match our data well. For example,\nthe most metal-poor isochrones are too blue compared with\nour data, thus suggesting that very metal-poor stars are unlikely to be present. On the contrary, metal-rich isochrones\ndo a better job in matching both the bright and faint end of\nthe RGB. As stated earlier, an age-metallicity degeneracy is\npresent in this region of the CMD, and therefore differences\nin ages cannot be distinguished if we look solely at the RGB.\nTo obtain the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of\nM32, shown in Figure 16, we have used isochrones from the\nmodel grid of the Padova library (Girardi et al. 2002; Marigo\net al. 2008; Girardi et al. 2008) for ages of 5, 8 and 10 Gyr\nand log(Z/Z ) = [M/H] from \u22121.2 to 0.3 dex with a metallicity step (bin size) of [M/H] = 0.2 dex. Although we do\nnot see the 5 Gyr MSTO10 , it is possible that M32 contains\nsuch a population due to the observation of bright AGB stars\nthat confirm the presence of an intermediate-age population\n(Sec. 5.1.5). For the metallicity distribution, we have first\n10 We would only see a 5 Gyr MSTO for a very metal poor population\nwhich is unlikely to contribute significantly to the M32 population in our\nfields: see Figure 15.\n\n19\n\nconsidered only RGB stars located below the RC and above\nthe 80% completeness level, to avoid contamination by AGB\nstars that ascend from the RC. We selected a box containing\n1166 stars of absolute magnitudes 1.2 < MF555W < 1.8 and\ndereddened colors 0.7 < (F435W \u2212 F555W )0 < 1.4 to compute the MDF below the RC. Selecting these stars guarantees\nan unambiguous metallicity assignment but, even though stars\nin this region of the CMD have small photometric errors, they\nare not negligible. Figure 10 shows that at the level of apparent magnitudes F555W \u223c 26.5, which corresponds to an\nabsolute magnitude of MF555W \u223c 1.7, and color \u223c 1 the photometric errors in colors in our selected box are in between\n\u223c 0.05 and \u223c 0.1 mag. The width of the RGB at those magnitudes is \u223c 0.7 mag and thus the small photometric errors\ncannot explain the observed spread in color. We also note\nthat variations in ages, from 2 to 9 Gyr, on the RGB can only\naccount for a \u223c 0.15 mag variation in color (see Figure 15).\nOn the other hand, if we use stars above the RC, for which the\nphotometric errors are truly negligible, implying that the color\nvariation of this region is only due to an intrinsic metallicity\ndistribution in the populations11 , we need to correct for the\ncontamination by AGB stars. We selected a box containing\n500 stars of absolute magnitudes \u22120.9 < MF555W < 0.0 and\ndereddened colors 0.9 < (F435W \u2212 F555W )0 < 1.65 for the\nMDF above the RC.\nWe have derived a MDF for these two groups of stars. The\ntop panel of Figure 16 shows the selected stars (boxes) and\nrepresentative isochrones considered for the MDF calculation.\nSolid and dashed curves are the 8 and 10 Gyr isochrones,\nrespectively. The middle and bottom panels of Figure 16\nshow the resulting MDF of M32 above and below the RC,\nrespectively, defined as the number of stars per bin size in\nlog(Z/Z ). We have counted RGB stars in the CMD between\nfixed-age isochrones (either 5, 8 or 10 Gyr old) covering the\nrange of metallicities stated above. We have attempted to correct the MDF above the RC for AGB contamination by taking\ninto account the theoretical ratio of AGB to RGB stars at different ages and metallicities. We calculated the ratio of AGB\nto RGB stars occupying the isochrone section considered, i.e.\nfor a given age and metallicity, using the \"int-IMF\"12 column of Padova's isochrones. We subtracted the corresponding number of AGB stars from the RGB counting between the\nisochrones considered to derive the MDF. Overall, we obtain\na rather smooth distribution with many more metal-rich stars\nthan metal-poor ones. The general peak of this distribution\nis given at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.2 dex with the exception of the 5 Gyr\nMDF above the RC that has its peak at [Fe/H] \u223c 0.0 dex. This\npeak agrees with previous results (Rose 1985, 1994; Grillmair\net al. 1996b; Trager et al. 2000a; Coelho et al. 2009). We note\nthat the peak in the MDF above the RC is more pronounced\ncompared to that in the MDF below the RC. We believe that\nthis arises from the cooler giant stars going back towards the\nblue at the TRGB due to the strong opacity present in the V\nband.\nNote that there are very few stars with metallicities\n[Fe/H] < \u22121.2, which implies that the enrichment process\nlargely avoided the metal poor stage (Worthey et al. 1996).\nMoreover, it is possible that some of the B-RGB is due to stars\n11 There is a spread in age based on the appearance of bright AGB stars,\nbut, again, such a variation can account only for a modest spread in the RGB\nand not for the width that is observed (G96).\n12 The \"int-IMF\" is the integral of the IMF under consideration (as selected\nin the form, in number of stars, and normalized to a total mass of 1 M ) from\n0 up to the current initial stellar mass: see http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/.\n\n\f20\n\nMonachesi et al.\nwith ages < 2 Gyr (see Figure 18 below), hence the number of\nmetal-poor stars is likely to be even smaller. Note also that a\nfew biases should have been taken into account when deriving\nthe MDF, such as e.g. the different RGB lifetimes at different metallicities (Rood 1972) or the rate at which stars leave\nthe main sequence (Renzini & Buzzoni 1986). These biases,\nhowever, mostly affect the metal-poor tail of the metallicity\ndistribution (see Zoccali et al. 2003), which implies that our\n(very weak) metal-poor tail is actually an upper limit. The\nshape and peak of the MDF agrees very well with the photometric MDF of G96. We even obtain the same peak value,\nwhich however disagrees with the synthetic population results\nby Coelho et al. (2009), who found a significant amount of\nmetal-poor stars at a location that samples the positions of\nboth G96 and our field. Coelho et al. (2009) claim that they\ndo not understand this difference, although they say that one\nmight not expect an MDF derived from photometry to match\nan MDF derived from spectroscopic data (although see Trager\net al. 2000a). Nevertheless, the difference is significant.\n5.1.4. The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB)\n\nAnother important CMD feature that confirms the results\nobtained so far is the tip of the RGB (TRGB). This corresponds to the He-burning ignition through the He flash marking the end of the RGB phase. For very metal rich systems,\nsuch as the globular clusters NGC 6553 and NGC 6528, the\nTRGB in the B, V and R filters is fainter than in metal-poor\nsystems due to the strong molecular opacities of TiO bands,\nwhich become very deep in the cool giants. This effect is so\nstrong in the V band that the TRGB in a V \u2013(B \u2212 V ) color\u2013\nmagnitude diagram is accompanied by a vertical sequence of\nstars extending to fainter magnitudes and almost merging with\nthe hotter giants (Ortolani et al. 1992). The location of what\nwe identify as the TRGB in the CMD of M32, at the apparent magnitude of F555W \u223c 24, (see Figure 12) corresponds\nto the theoretical predictions of a system as old as \u223c8.5 Gyr\nwith [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.2. This again confirms previous (e.g., G96)\nand our own results in this section.\n5.1.5.

Black and\nred\u2013dashed curves are 8 and 10 Gyr-old Girardi et al. (2008) and Marigo\net al. (2008) isochrones covering a wide range in metallicity, Z = 0.0012,\n0.003, 0.008, 0.03. We counted stars between the isochrones of different\nmetallicities to compute the MDF. Errors are simply Poisson errors. Middle\npanel MDF of M32 derived using stars above the RC, defined as the number\nof stars per bin size in log(Z/Z ) =[Fe/H]. The counting has been corrected\nfor contamination by AGB stars in this region. Blue, black and red lines represent 5, 8 and 10 Gyr-old MDFs, respectively. The peak of the distribution is\nat [Fe/H] \u223c 0.0 for 5 Gyr and is slightly more metal-poor, at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.2,\nfor 8 and 10 Gyr-old populations. Bottom panel Same as the middle panel\nbut considering stars below the RC, which are affected by photometric errors\nbut not by AGB stars. Here the peak of the distribution is at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.2\nfor all ages. The MDF of M31 is also computed for a 10 Gyr-old population\nand is illustrated by the gray solid line. The M31 MDF has been normalized\nto the M32 MDF, and its peak is given at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.4, indicating that our\nbackground field contains more metal-poor stars. Note that the M31 metal\nabundance distribution looks very similar to that of M32.\n\nFinally, the bright extension of AGB stars seen above the\nfirst-ascent red giant branch (or TRGB) is a signature of an\nintermediate-age population (see e.g. Freedman 1992a; Gallart et al. 2005). We thus identify the bright stars seen in\nFigure 12 at apparent magnitudes F555W < 24 and colors\n1.0 . (F435W \u2212 F555W ) . 1.6 as intermediate-age AGB\nstars. We find \u223c 130 of these stars in the CMD of M32. To\ntest whether blends of fainter stars could mimic bright AGBs\nwe make use of the AST results. From AST, we considered\nall the recovered bright AGB stars and we looked at their injected counterpart stars, i.e. we looked at where these bright\nstars came from theoretically. We obtained that \u223c 97% correspond to the injected bright AGB. We are confident hence that\nthe detected AGB stars in our photometry are not artifacts of\ncrowding since they cannot be generated by blends of fainter\nstars. The existence of these stars confirms the results of previous studies (e.g., Freedman 1992a; Elston & Silva 1992;\nDavidge & Jensen 2007), and strongly supports the presence\nof an intermediate-age population in M32. Figure 17 shows\na decontaminated CMD of M32, corrected for distance and\nextinction with Padova solar metallicity isochrones superimposed, for ages of 1, 4, 7 and 9 Gyr.

Bright AGB stars,\nlocated above the TRGB, are clearly present at ages younger than 7 Gyr.\n\nbright AGB stars thus represent the evolved population resulting from star formation that occurred less than 7 Gyr ago in\nM32.\nTo summarize, the RC suggests a mean age of 8\u201310 Gyr for\na metallicity of [Fe/H] = \u22120.2 dex, consistent with the position\nof the TRGB. The RC, RGBb and AGBb suggest a dominant\npopulation of stars with a mean age of 5\u201310 Gyr and a mean\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] & \u22120.4 dex. In addition, stars younger\nthan 7 Gyr are present as bright extended-AGB stars.\n5.2. Young populations?: Ages < 2 Gyr\n\nYoung populations are mostly represented by stars occupying the blue plume (BP) seen in the CMD of Figure 12 at\nF555W \u223c 24.5 from F555W \u223c 27 and (F435W \u2212 F555W ) <\n0.5, suggesting the presence of an extended main sequence\n(MS). We note that the presence of a BP in M32 has either\nnot been claimed or not observed in previous photometric\nworks (e.g., G96; Worthey et al. 2004). Therefore, we begin\nthis section by addressing whether this feature is real or not.\nBlends of fainter blue stars could appear in our photometry\nas brighter blue stars, generating a BP which is actually artifact of crowding. We have tested this using the results from\nthe ASTs. We estimated the fraction of recovered BP stars\nthat were actually injected as red or fainter stars; \u223c 14% of\nrecovered BP stars are blends, thus indicating that \u223c 86% are\ngenuine blue stars. We are hence confident that the detected\nBP is indeed real. Moreover, we have investigated archival\nobservations of fields near M32, which also seem to indicate\nthe presence of a BP in M32. This analysis is shown in the\n\n21\n\nF IG . 18.- CMD of M32 corrected for contamination by the M31 background stars, reddening (E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08, Burstein & Heiles 1982) and\nextinction (AF555W = 0.25, Sirianni et al. 2005). The distance modulus\n\u03bc0 = 24.53 \u00b1 0.12 was obtained using the RCS method (see text for more\ndescription). Solar metallicity isochrones from Marigo et al. (2008) are superimposed, with ages of 0.4,0.5,0.7,1, and 1.5 Gyr. Note the good fit to the\nextended MS of the CMD, and the suggestion of the presence of subgiant\nstars. On the other hand, the diamonds show the location of the RR Lyrae\nfound in this M32 field (F10). These isochrones also fit the BL region (delineated by the black box) well, suggesting the presence of young AGB stars\nwith masses of 2.5\u20132.8 M .\n\nAppendix.\nFigure 18 shows Padova isochrones (Marigo et al. 2008;\nGirardi et al. 2008) for young ages superimposed on the decontaminated, de-reddened and corrected for distance M32\nCMD. The isochrones have solar metallicity Z = 0.019 and\na range of ages of 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1, and 1.5 Gyr. This suggests that M32 at F1's location may contain stars as young as\n\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1.5 Gyr; other higher metallicities, for Z ranging from\nZ to 0.03 ([Fe/H] \u223c +0.2), show similar results. However,\nlower metallicities isochrones are too blue compared with the\nobserved data. On the other hand, we can see that any significant presence of populations younger than 0.4 Gyr is ruled\nout in this field, although stars as young as 0.5 Gyr may be\npresent. We even appear to find a possible subgiant branch\n(SGB), with a region occupied by stars as soon as they leave\nthe MS. These SGB stars are consistent with isochrones of\nages from 0.5 Gyr to 1.5 Gyr for stars with masses 1.6 \u2212 2.5\nM and a range of metallicities Z = 0.019 \u2212 0.03 ([Fe/H] \u223c 0\nto +0.2). We also show in Figure 18 the position of known RR\nLyrae variables in field F1 (F10), indicating the presence of\nsome blue horizontal branch stars in this region of the CMD.\nIt is worth noting that the number of RR Lyrae discovered in\nthis field (17, of which 7+4\n\u22123 belong to M32 ) cannot account for\nall of the stars in this region (\u223c 100). Nevertheless, the SGB\nregion of the CMD is the most affected by blends: stars either\nbluer or redder are likely to blend and occupy this region. We\n\n\f22\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 19.- Left panel: CMD of the quadrant Q1 closest to the nucleus of\nM32 in F1. Right panel: CMD of the quadrant Q4 furthest away from the nucleus of M32. We compare the BP in these two CMDs in order to test whether\nit belongs to M32 or it represents a constant M31 background in F1. It seems\nthat the fainter BP F555W > 26 is indeed stronger in Q1, which indicates\nthat this portion of the BP comes from M32. However, the brighter BP stars,\nwhich assured the presence of a young population, do not show any significant difference between the two CMDs. They could represent a constant M31\ndisk background in F1. See text and Table 4 for more information.\n\ntested this using the results from ASTs and found that only a\n\u223c 38% of stars recovered in this region were actually injected\nthere. Most of the stars are therefore blends and we are not\nable to assume that they are all actual SGB stars.\nThe presence of a blue loop (BL) is another sign of young\npopulations and has never been detected before in M32. Stars\nin this region are intermediate-mass stars with ages between\n\u223c 0.4 and \u223c 1 Gyr burning helium in their cores (see, e.g.,\nSweigart 1987; Xu & Li 2004, and references therein) . Theoretical models predict that their positions strongly depend\non metallicity (e.g., Girardi et al. 2000). The box in Figure 18\nshows the location of BL stars. We considered the fact that\nthese stars could also be artifacts of crowding and we analyzed this again using the results from the ASTs. We found\nthat \u223c 80% of the recovered stars in the BL region were actually injected there. We are certain that most of the stars\nin the BL are real and not products of blends. We can see\nfrom Figure 18 that their magnitudes and colors are consistent\nwith the assumed solar metallicity and ages of 0.4\u20130.9 Gyr\nand they have masses in the range \u223c 2.25-3 M . Isochrones\nwith lower metallicities predict the location of the BL bluer\nthan observed. Note also that the isochrones in Figure 18 suggest the presence of young AGB stars as well, of ages between 0.7\u20131 Gyr, with masses of 2.5\u20132.8 M . However this\nregion may be also occupied by older RGB and AGB stars\nwith lower metallicities (see the previous section) and much\nlower masses, of the order of 0.9\u20131 M .\nThe bright stars composing the BP and BL features remain\nin the CMD even after the statistical decontamination for M31\nstars. This would indicate that they belong to M32. However,\nwhile we took care to characterize the M31 disk ground by devoting equal time to the F2 images, the surface density of the\nM31 disk may (unfortunately) be higher at F1 than it is at F2.\nArp (1966) noted that M32 (Arp 168) appears to have a diffuse \"plume\" of emission to the south of its nucleus, and thus\nin the direction of F1. Choi et al. (2002) attempted to isolate\nthis feature through a variety of surface photometry models,\nand suggested that it is due to the tidal interaction of M31\nwith M32. The obvious inference is that the plume comprises\nstars that have been stripped from M32; however, if the plume\n\ninstead represents material drawn for the M31 disk, then this\nmay enhance the contribution of disk stars to F1 over what\nwe would have inferred from F2. To test whether the young\npopulation (ages < 1 Gyr) comes from M32 or M31, we have\nfirst compared the CMDs obtained from closest and furthest\nquadrants from the nucleus of M32 (hereafter Q1 and Q4, respectively) in F1. Since, given the rapid decline of the M32\nsurface brightness, we observe a gradient in the stellar density of M32 over F1 (Figure 2), we should therefore detect\na larger number of bright BP and BL stars as we approach\nthe nucleus of M32 if they belong to M32. Figure 19 shows\nthe CMDs in apparent magnitudes obtained in Q1 (left panel)\nand in Q4 (right panel). The number of BL stars as well as\nBP stars brighter than F555W \u223c 26 seems to be roughly the\nsame in both CMDs. However, the number of fainter BP stars\n(F555W > 26) is significantly larger in Q1. To quantify this,\nwe define eight boxes in different regions of the CMDs and\nwe count stars in them. The different regions are the BP, BL,\nAGB and RGB (see Figure 12) and the corresponding boxes\nare indicated in Table 4. This analysis was done not only in\nthe Q1 and the Q4 CMDs but also in the F1 (before decontamination for F2) and F2 CMDs. Assuming Poisson statistics\nwe can infer whether (F1\u2212F2) and/or (Q1\u2212Q4) is significantly\npositive for each of the boxes. The results of (Q1\u2212Q4) suggest that there is a constant background of bright blue stars\nover F1, since there is no significant difference between the\nnumber of bright BP and BL stars. The ratio between the\nnumber of stars in F1 to F2 is also shown in Table 4 for each\nof the regions. This fraction is expected to be \u223c 3 according to the surface brightness estimates at F1's location. Note\nthat this is clearly the case for the RGB stars and the fainter\nBP stars (26.0 < F555W < 27.0). However, the ratio is lower\nthan 3 for the brighter portion of the BP, the BL and bright\nAGB stars which indicates that the M31's background is relatively enhanced in F1 compared to what F2 represents. As\nstated above, a plausible explanation for an enhanced contribution of disk stars to F1 is that the \"diffuse plume\" observed\nin M32 at F1's location (Arp 1966) represents material drawn\nfor the M31 disk. Given the null difference between stars in\nQ1 and Q4, it is likely that all of the bright BP stars belong\nto M31. It is likely then that the very young population that\nwe see in the decontaminated CMD of M32 (i.e. stars with\nages \u223c 0.5 Gyr) belongs to the disk of M31 rather than to\nM32. Instead, stars in the BP at magnitudes F555W > 26 do\nbelong to M32 and represent a population of ages between 1\nand 2 Gyr (see Figure 18). Further investigation is required to\nconclusively determine whether a young population of stars\nwith ages \u223c 0.5 Gyr do or do not belong to M32. Wide field\nimages from fields closer to the nucleus of M32, as could be\nobtained with HST/WFPC3, would reveal this. Note that the\nQ1\u2212Q4 difference in the bright AGB region is positive, and\nthe F1/F2 ratio for these stars is significantly higher than for\nthe brightest BP stars13 . This implies that, even though there\nis an enhancement of M31 AGB stars over what F2 represents,\nit is likely that a fraction of them still belong to M32.\nYoung population vs. Blue straggler stars - Blue straggler stars\n(BSSs) are stars hotter, bluer and brighter than the MSTOs in\na CMD and thus generate a blue plume, similar to the one we\nsee in the CMD. As they can mimic a young population (ages\n13 The F1/F2 ratio of BL stars is also higher than for the brightest BP stars.\nHowever, BL stars are more contaminated by blends than AGB stars, which\nare nearly no contaminated at all.

See Figure 2.\n\n< 2 Gyr), it is crucial for the derivation of the SFH to understand whether the BP we find in M32 is entirely populated by\nold BSSs instead of a genuinely young population.\nBSSs have been seen in globular and open clusters (e.g.,\nFerraro et al. 2004; Mapelli et al. 2004, 2006; Piotto et al.\n2004; de Marchi et al. 2006) where there is no recent star formation or the spread in stellar age is small enough such that\ntheir identification as old BSSs (instead of as a young population) is very clear. In a field population it is difficult to unambiguously prove the nature of the BP as old BSSs (see, e.g.,\nMateo et al. 1995; Hurley-Keller et al. 1999; Aparicio et al.\n2001; Carrera et al. 2002; Mapelli et al. 2009). Only Momany et al. (2007) in their work indicated that their BSS candidates in dSphs may be real BSSs. They found a statisticallysignificant anti-correlation between the specific frequency of\nBSS candidates with the HB stars and the absolute magnitude\nof their dSph sample, similar to what has been observed in\nboth globular clusters (Piotto et al. 2004) and open clusters (de\nMarchi et al. 2006). Momany et al. (2007) claimed that this\nanti-correlation can be used as a classification tool such that\ngalaxies following the anti-correlation are more likely to have\nreal BSSs rather than young MS stars (the anti-correlation\nwould be hard to explain if BSS candidates were young stars).\nIt is worth of mentioning that they selected their sample in\nsuch a way that dwarf spheroidals/irregulars in which there is\ncurrent or recent (\u2264 500 Myr) star formation were not considered. Therefore, an ideal test for our data would be to calculate the frequency of BSS candidates in M32 and compare\nour results to the proposed relation of Figure 2 of Momany\net al. (2007). However, the box considered to include the candidates of old BSSs goes from the magnitudes of the oldest\nMSTOs up to where there are blue stars observed. We do not\nreach the oldest MSTOs; the stars at the appropriate magnitude level are dominantly products of blends, which will contaminate the BSS candidates in our data. We are therefore\nunable to test, at least in this way, whether the BP consists of\nold BSSs. Nevertheless, we favor the idea that the BP cannot be entirely populated by old BSSs but instead contains\nsome genuine young stars due to the following: Brown et al.\n(2006) argue that, even though the formation mechanism of\nBSS is not completely understood, BSSs in an old population\nwill be limited to M < 2M , whereas the masses required to\nexplain stars as bright as, and even exceeding, the HB luminosity level that we see in our CMD are higher than that value\n(2 < M < 3M ). This implies that at least the brightest BP\nstars observed are truly young stars. However, as explained\n\nabove, they are likely to belong to the disk of M31 rather than\nto M32. The fainter BP, F555W > 26, associated to M32 is\nnot assured to be only young stars and it could even be composed only of BSSs.\n5.3. Ancient population: Ages > 10 Gyr\nWe believe that old and metal-poor stars should be present\nin M32, since previous generations of stars are required to\nproduce the metal-rich population we observe. It is clear from\nour CMD that there are not many of these stars since there is\nno noticeable presence of blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars.\nTherefore a well-developed old, metal poor population is not\npresent. Nonetheless, RR Lyrae variable stars were found in\nour M32 field with our data (F10), revealing the presence of\nBHB stars. The pioneering work of Brown et al. (2000, 2008)\nshowed evidence of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars\nin the central region of M32 from Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) UV observations. By detecting RR\nLyrae stars in our data, we find a different manifestation of a\nconsistent picture.\nThe RR Lyrae stars found with the data from this study\nhave a mean metallicity of h[Fe/H]i \u223c \u22121.5 (F10). Taking\ninto account the metallicity distribution we have obtained (see\nabove) and assuming that these metal-poor stars are ancient\nstars, we can estimate the fraction of these stars in our data.\nWe find that, when assuming a 10 Gyr-old population, metalpoor stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 represent at most \u223c 5.7% of the\ntotal V -band light in our M32 field (recall that the number of\nstars in metal-poor tail of the MDF is an upper limit). Worthey\n(1994) models can be used to obtain the stellar M/L ratio for\ndifferent metallicities at a given assumed age. We estimate\nthat a metal-poor 10 Gyr-old population contributes \u223c 4.5%\nof the total mass in our observed field. Note however that\nthere is little constraint on ancient, metal-rich populations.\nThe fact that the hot HB stars do not significantly contribute\nto the optical V -band light of M32 suggests that the strong\nBalmer lines found in spectroscopic studies (O'Connell 1980;\nPickles 1985; Bica et al. 1990; Rose 1994) actually represent\na young population or BSSs. Trager et al. (2000b) estimated\nthat the BHBs needed to account for the strong Balmer lines\nof M32 (H\u03b2 = 1.9 \u00c5, corresponding to an integrated light age\nof \u223c 8 Gyr) at F1's location would contribute to the \u223c 5% of\nthe V -band light. This would imply that \u223c 25% of the total\nlight would have to come from metal-poor stars, which is \u223c5\ntimes more than the amount of metal-poor V -band light that\nwe have found. On the other hand, to explain the high-H\u03b2\n\n\f24\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\nF IG . 20.- F555W0 -band Luminosity Function (LF) for M32, corrected for\nextinction and decontaminated for M31 background stars, is shown in the\nsolid histogram.

The 50% completeness level is indicated at a magnitude of F555W0 \u223c 27.75. The main features\nof this LF are indicated by arrows. The TRGB lies at F555W0 \u223c 23.7, the\nAGB bump at F555W0 \u223c 24.7, the RC at F555W0 \u223c 25.4, and the RGB\nbump at F555W0 \u223c 25.9.\n\nstrength of M32 arising from a population of BSSs would require that & 15% of the V -band light come from BSSs (Trager\net al. 2000a).

The Luminosity function of M32\nThe extinction-corrected F555W0 luminosity function (LF)\nfor M32 is given in Table 5. The LF is measured by dividing the F555W0 magnitudes into 65 bins with a bin width of\n\u2206F555W0 = 0.1 mag. The LF is shown as the solid histogram\nin Figure 20. We have also calculated the completenesscorrected LF (black dots). The long vertical arrow marks the\n50% completeness level at F555W0 \u223c 27.75. The main distinct features are indicated by arrows: the TRGB at F555W0 \u223c\n23.7, the AGBb at F555W0 \u223c 24.7, the RC at F555W0 \u223c 25.4\nand the RGBb at F555W0 \u223c 25.9. These features are consistent with the CMD analysis above. We also show the LF for\nstars redder than (F435W \u2212 F555W ) = 0.75, as gray-dashed\nhistogram. We can see that the features that we find on the\nRGB region, in particular the RGBb, are better identified\nwhen we plot only the redder stars thus avoiding contamination from, for example, the BP.\nTo summarize this section, M32 is dominated by a 8\u2013\n10 Gyr old, metal-rich ([Fe/H] = \u22120.20 dex) population, due\nto the RC location and width of the RGB. This result is\nsupported by the locations of the RGBb and the AGBb.\nIntermediate-age stars of 4\u00b13 Gyr are also present in M32, as\nrevealed by the bright AGB stars observed and the morphology of the strong RC. We see evidence for 1\u20132 Gyr MSTO\nstars and/or BSSs due to the presence of the BP. An ancient\nmetal-poor population does not contribute much to the light\nof M32 in F1. There is, however, little constraint on its metalrich counterpart.\n6. THE DISTANCE TO M32 AND M31\n\nWe determine the distance to M32 using the Red Clump\nStars (RCS)14 . Udalski (1998) has stressed that this method\nhas many advantages with respect to other widely used standard candles such as Cepheid and RR Lyrae: for example,\nRCS are easy to recognize in a CMD and large samples are\nusually present in galaxies, which is certainly true in our case.\nAnother important advantage is the fact that the mean absolute\nmagnitude of RCS in the Solar neighborhood has been calibrated by Hipparcos (Perryman & ESA 1997; Perryman et al.\n1997) parallaxes with an accuracy of 10%. The disadvantage\nhowever is that its properties are not the same for all galaxies,\ngiven the age-metallicity dependence of the RC which affects\nthe value of its absolute magnitude. Since models of corehelium-burning stars predict that the RC luminosity depends\non both age and metallicity (Cole 1998; Girardi et al. 1998;\nGirardi & Salaris 2001), \"population corrections\" to the RC\nabsolute magnitude obtained using Hipparcos parallaxes need\nto be made before it can be used as an accurate extragalactic\ndistance indicator. Percival & Salaris (2003) have calculated\nhow the absolute magnitudes of RCS differ for a given age\nand metallicity when compared with the Solar-neighborhood\nRC absolute magnitude, \u2206M\u03bbRC . Taking these variations into\naccount, we can still use the RCS to estimate the distance of\nM32.

This value is then dereddened assuming E(B \u2212V ) = 0.08 (Burstein & Heiles 1982)\nand an extinction of AF555W = 0.25 (Sirianni et al. 2005). On\nthe other hand, the Hipparcos absolute magnitude and the\ntheoretical population corrections to the Red Clump absolute magnitudes were calibrated and calculated on the UBV\nsystem. We need therefore to transform our data from the\nACS/HRC VEGA system F435W and F555W to the groundbased B and V magnitudes. We use the Sirianni et al. (2005)\ntransformations for this. The MVRC from Hipparcos for the soRC\nlar neighborhood is calibrated as MV,local\n= 0.73 \u00b1 0.03 (Alves\net al. 2002). The population correction \u2206M\u03bbRC is calculated\nby Percival & Salaris (2003) and we refer to that paper for\na detailed explanation. Briefly, to study the age and metallicity dependence of the RC brightness, they compare their\nempirically derived population corrections with the theoretical models of Girardi et al. (2000, see Figure 2 in Percival & Salaris 2003). In our case, assuming an average\nh[Fe/H]i = \u22120.2 dex and an age of 8 Gyr for our RCS (G96,\nthis paper), \u2206MVRC = \u22120.1. Percival & Salaris (2003) calculate\nthe residuals of \u2206M\u03bbRC for their model \u2013 observed fits taking\ninto account both the metallicity and age residuals. The mean\nresidual in \u2206MVRC is +0.03 \u00b1 0.07, where the error is the 1\u03c3\nerror. The true distance modulus of M32 from Equation 7 is\n14 A widely-used standard candle for determining the distance to a stellar\nsystem is the TRGB method (Lee et al. 1993), which determines distances\nusing the TRGB discontinuity in the I-band. However, an essential property\nof the TRGB distance indicator in the original method (Lee et al. 1993) is that\nthe absolute magnitude in the I band is less sensitive to changes on metallicity\nthan the B or V magnitudes (note in Figure 15 how the position of the TRGB\non the F555W band varies with metallicity at a fixed age). Thus, the TRGB\nmethod cannot be applied here to obtain the distance to M32 because we do\nnot have the correct magnitude bands to do so.\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\n25\n\nTABLE 5\nM32 L UMINOSITY F UNCTION\nF555W0\n22.45\n22.53\n22.62\n22.70\n22.78\n22.87\n22.95\n23.03\n23.11\n23.20\n23.28\n23.36\n23.45\n23.53\n23.61\n23.69\n23.78\n23.86\n23.94\n24.02\n24.11\n24.19\n24.27\n24.36\n\na\n\nN\n\nb\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n9\n6\n8\n8\n8\n12\n10\n13\n14\n5\n16\n15\n21\n33\n36\n56\n50\n68\n67\n64\n\nNcorr\n\nc\n\n1.00\n0.00\n0.00\n2.00\n9.00\n6.00\n8.00\n8.00\n8.00\n12.08\n10.00\n13.00\n14.00\n5.00\n16.00\n15.00\n21.00\n33.00\n36.11\n56.39\n50.00\n68.00\n67.12\n64.11\n\nN(col>0.75)\n1\n0\n0\n2\n2\n11\n7\n8\n3\n10\n10\n16\n6\n15\n4\n17\n14\n18\n33\n32\n53\n46\n57\n70\n\nd\n\nF555W0\n\nN\n\nNcorr\n\nN(col>0.75)\n\nF555W0\n\nN\n\nNcorr\n\nN(col>0.75)\n\n24.44\n24.52\n24.60\n24.69\n24.77\n24.85\n24.94\n25.02\n25.10\n25.18\n25.27\n25.35\n25.43\n25.52\n25.60\n25.68\n25.76\n25.85\n25.93\n26.01\n26.09\n26.18\n26.26\n26.34\n\n73\n77\n107\n91\n96\n79\n119\n110\n191\n257\n400\n534\n628\n433\n235\n203\n201\n220\n235\n229\n200\n196\n230\n234\n\n73.64\n77.55\n107.77\n91.94\n97.35\n79.40\n120.55\n111.61\n194.20\n261.86\n409.63\n544.64\n641.55\n445.35\n242.03\n211.08\n208.43\n228.30\n247.53\n239.49\n209.56\n205.74\n243.67\n247.77\n\n51\n66\n61\n86\n91\n89\n86\n77\n103\n100\n170\n210\n339\n456\n601\n466\n232\n190\n146\n173\n183\n171\n170\n139\n\n26.43\n26.51\n26.59\n26.67\n26.76\n26.84\n26.92\n27.01\n27.09\n27.17\n27.25\n27.34\n27.42\n27.50\n27.59\n27.67\n27.75\n27.83\n27.92\n28.00\n28.08\n28.16\n\n257\n329\n366\n418\n480\n517\n652\n751\n929\n1106\n1356\n1586\n1671\n1936\n2009\n1885\n1626\n740\n179\n44\n12\n4\n\n276.43\n349.93\n389.89\n453.06\n526.73\n568.22\n721.45\n852.73\n1052.41\n1277.55\n1598.82\n1896.35\n2072.59\n2462.01\n2633.19\n2519.17\n2260.72\n1075.84\n276.44\n72.50\n21.28\n7.77\n\n135\n138\n143\n150\n196\n192\n188\n251\n267\n312\n356\n433\n535\n608\n775\n844\n907\n977\n891\n872\n623\n113\n\na Dereddened magnitude of the bin center.\nb Raw counts in a given magnitude bin for the decontaminated data.\nc Completeness-corrected counts for the same decontaminated data.\nd Raw counts in a given magnitude bin for stars with (F435W \u2212 F555W ) > 0.75\n\ntherefore\n\u03bc0 = (25.33 \u00b1 0.088) \u2212 (0.73 \u00b1 0.03) + (\u22120.10 + 0.03 \u00b1 0.07)\n(9)\nor\n\u03bc0 (M32) = 24.53 \u00b1 0.12\n(10)\nin agreement with previous results, e.g. 24.2 \u00b1 0.3 (Freedman\n1992b), 24.55\u00b10.08 (Tonry et al. 2001), 24.39\u00b10.08 (Jensen\net al. 2003), and 24.53 \u00b1 0.21 (F10).\nWe can also obtain the distance to M31 from our background field using the RCS of F2. This will also give us\na relative distance measurement between these two galaxies.\nTo this end, we selected 1107 stars from field F2 having apparent magnitudes 25.0 < F555W < 26.0 and colors 0.95 <\n(F435W \u2212 F555W ) < 1.32. We then fit the histogram of the\nluminosities and colors of these stars with Equation 6. We\nfind F555Wm = 25.49 \u00b1 0.06 and (F435W \u2212 F555W )(RC) =\n1.14 \u00b1 0.10. After we de-redden (E(B \u2212V ) = 0.08) and transform these values onto the UBV system (Sirianni et al. 2005),\nwe consider the differences between the mean RC population\nin M31 at our field location and the RCS in our solar neighborhood. We consider the metallicity [Fe/H] = \u22120.40 dex and\nan age of 8 Gyr for our M31 field, which corresponds to a population correction \u2206MVRC = +0.02 (Percival & Salaris 2003).\nWe obtain a true distance modulus of\n\u03bc0 (M31) = 24.45 \u00b1 0.14\n\n(11)\n\nfor M31, in agreement with previous estimates of its true\ndistance modulus, e.g. 24.44 \u00b1 0.11 (Freedman & Madore\n1990), 24.50 \u00b1 0.10 (Brown et al. 2004), and 24.47 \u00b1 0.07\n(McConnachie et al. 2005). The most up-to-date values have\nbeen obtained using Cepheids (Saha et al. 2006) and RR\nLyrae (Sarajedini et al. 2009; Fiorentino et al. 2010), \u03bc0 =\n24.54 \u00b1 0.07, 24.46 \u00b1 0.11, and 24.49 \u00b1 0.19, respectively.\nClearly the obtained values here for M32 and M31 distance\n\nmoduli are comparable, and, within the errors, it is not possible to determine with our data whether M32 is projected in\nfront of or behind M31. We are therefore unable to confirm\nthe results of Ford et al. (1978), who found evidence of M32\nbeing in front of M31.\n7. M31 STELLAR POPULATIONS IN F2\n\nField F2 serves not only as a background, allowing the M32\nphotometry to be decontaminated for M31, but is also very\nimportant as it contains information about the stellar populations in the inner disk and bulge of M31. In this section we\nfirst compare the stellar populations in F2 with the ones in F1.\nWe then analyze the M31 stellar population from the F2 CMD\nand compare it with what it is known in the literature.\n7.1. Differentiating the F1 and F2 CMDs\n\nThe CMDs of F1 and F2 are shown in Figure 7. We note\nthat, at first glance, they are very similar. They seem to share\nthe same morphology: a wide RGB, a noticeable RC, and a\nBP. Furthermore, when we statistically subtract field F2 from\nF1, we notice that many features remain in the CMD of M32.\nThus, due to the similarities in both CMDs, we cannot be certain there is not M32 contamination in field F2. Is it possible\nthat F2 field is contaminated with tidal debris from M32? If\nthere were M32 contamination in the background field, we\nhave overcorrected the M32 CMD and we are thus missing\ninformation about our primary field F1. Note that this is unlikely: the predicted contribution of M32 to the F2 field is\nvery small, representing a surface brightness of \u03bcV \u2248 27.5,\nwhile M31 has \u03bcV \u2248 22.7 in this field. On the other hand,\nwe want to be sure that the contamination from M31 was\ncompletely removed from F1 (statistically speaking), and not\nunder-subtracted.\nTo investigate whether there are differences in the morphology of these two CMDs, which then would reveal differences\n\n\f26\n\nMonachesi et al.\nof the RCs, suggests that M32 possesses more intermediate\nage stars than M31 in our fields. Note in addition that there\nis a magnitude difference, \u223c 0.2 mag, between the RCs in F1\nand F2. The brighter RC in M31, however, does not directly\nindicate that M32 must be behind M31. As stated in previous\nsections (see, e.g., Sections 5.1 and 6), the CMD location of\nthe RC for a stellar system depends on both its age and metallicity. Hence, a difference between the RC's magnitudes in\nF1 and F2 CMDs may be only due to differences between the\nstellar populations of M32 and M31.\nOverall, this subtraction reveals that the M31 stellar populations in our field F2 are younger and more metal-poor than\nthe M32 population in F115 . The latter is in agreement with\nthe MDFs.\n7.2. M31 inner disk and bulge stellar populations\n\nF IG . 21.- Subtraction of the normalized F1 error-based Hess diagram from\nthe F2 one. The normalization is such that the number of stars in F1 and F2\nare the same. The normalization factor is 0.32. Negative values imply oversubtraction and therefore more M32 stars, and positive ones represent undersubtraction and therefore more M31 stars. The subtraction reveals significant\nmorphological differences between the M32 and M31 background CMDs.\n\nin the stellar populations, we have subtracted the normalized\nF1 Hess diagram (before decontamination) from the F2 one.\nThe F1 Hess diagram has been normalized by a factor of 0.32,\nwhich is the ratio of the F2 to F1 (uncorrected for M31 contamination) stars above the 80% completeness level. The F2\nHess diagram has been also normalized by its total number\nof stars above a completeness level of 80%. Thus, both diagrams are normalized so that they have the same amount of\nstars. Figure 21 shows the result of this subtraction. Negative\nvalues illustrate over-subtraction (more M32) whereas positive values represent under-subtraction (more M31).\nInterestingly the subtraction exposes clear differences between the two CMDs. An over-subtraction would imply an\nexcess of the relative fraction of M32 stars in that region of\nthe CMD. On the contrary an under-subtracted region would\nimply an excess of fraction of M31 stars. It is clear from the\nsubtraction that the RC in the M31 field lies at and extends towards bluer colors, indicating a more metal-poor population\nthan in M32. In addition, the RGB of M32 is considerably\nredder than that of M31, indicating higher metallicity stars in\nM32 not present in M31. There is not a significant difference\nin the BP population. However there appears to be an excess of F2 stars at higher luminosities, in the BP, indicating a\nlarger number of stars with younger ages present in M31. The\nfraction of M32 stars in the region of apparent magnitudes\nF555W between \u223c 27 and \u223c 28 dominates over M31 stars\n(see Table 4). This, together with the different morphologies\n\nThe stellar populations of the disk of M31 have been extensively studied by several means. However, those studies were\nmainly focused on the outer disk of M31. The present data\nare the deepest optical observations of the inner disk of M31\nto date and are sensitive to the young stellar populations.\nWe summarize here our findings about the stellar populations in F2. The broad RGB of its CMD (right panel in Figure 7) indicates a wide metallicity spread. We derive the MDF\nof M31, using the method of Section 5.1.3, and it is shown in\nthe bottom panel of Figure 16 as a gray line representing a 10\nGyr-old population. The F2 histogram has been multiplied by\na factor of 1.9, the ratio of the decontaminated M32 to field\nF2 stars with completeness level above 80%. The selection\nof stars to compute the MDF has the same constraints as in\nthe M32 MDF computation but only the results for stars below the RC are shown here since there was no difference with\nthose above the RC. We have selected 611 stars below the\nRC in F2, having absolute magnitudes 0.95 < MF555W < 1.60\nand dereddened colors 0.75 < (F435W \u2212 F555W )0 < 1.40.\nWe have assumed a Galactic reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08\n(Burstein & Heiles 1982) and a distance modulus for M31\nof \u03bc0 (M31) = 24.45 (this paper). The peak of this distribution is at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.4 dex, indicating a more metal-poor\npopulation of stars in our background field than in F1. Note\nthat almost no stars more metal-poor than [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.2 dex\nare present in our data. We detect blue stars above the\nHB level, indicating the presence of stars as young as 0.5\nGyr (see argument in Brown et al. 2006 and in Section 5.2\nabove). The detection of AGB stars indicates the presence of\nan intermediate-age population. However, the Hess diagram\nsubtraction suggests that this population in our M31 field is\nless significant than that in M32 (see Figure 21).\nWilliams (2002) studied 27 fields in the disk of M31, using HST/WFPC2 archival data. He performed photometry on\nthese fields and statistically derived the star formation history\nof each of them. The random distribution of most of these\nfields as well as the comparison of their SFHs allow an overall understanding of the formation and evolution of the M31\ndisk. Note, however, that these data are strictly limited to the\n15 We note that this result appears to contradict the mass-metallicity relations found in, e.g., Tremonti et al. (2004); Gallazzi et al. (2005). However,\nthose relations have not only significant spreads but also refer to the centers of galaxies. Our M31 field is near the edge of the visible disk and thus\nlikely has lower metallicity than the center, whereas it is well known that M32\nhas at best a mild metallicity gradient so that the outer regions are nearly as\nmetal-rich as the center (see, e.g., Worthey 2004). We are therefore comparing the (relatively) metal-poor outskirts of the M31 disk with the (relatively)\nmetal-rich outskirts of M32, and the mass\u2013metallicity relation as such does\nnot apply.\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\ngiant branch and, therefore, an accurate measurement of the\nage cannot be achieved. Williams concluded that the SFR of\nthe disk as a whole has been very active until about 1 Gyr ago,\nwhen the overall SFR declined with the exceptions of some areas of the spiral arms. He also showed that the disk of M31 is\ndeficient in old metal-poor stars and that an intermediate-age,\nmetal-rich population is present in most of the fields. A young\npopulation, however, is only significant in fields within the\nspiral arms. From the 27 fields, three are located in the vicinity of M32 which show nearly identical SFRs. Their SFRs\nindicate a moderate decline from 10 Gyr to 1 Gyr followed\nby a steep decline after that. The metallicity of these three\nfields is quite high, [Fe/H] > \u22120.5 dex, with only a very small\nfraction of stars with [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.0 dex in one of the fields.\nWorthey et al. (2005) have also studied archival observations\nof HST/WFPC2 fields in the disk of M31. They however restricted their interest to the metal abundance distribution and\nthe efficacy of the closed-box model. They find a robust metal\nabundance distribution that appears to hold in the vicinity of\nour fields but also further out, with a FWHM of \u223c 0.6 dex.\nThe peak of the distribution at [Fe/H] = \u22120.25 dex is quite\nmetal-rich, which agrees with Williams' results. Olsen et al.\n(2006), on the other hand, studied high resolution, deep nearIR images of the inner disk and bulge of M31 obtained with\nGemini North telescope. They conclude that most of the inner\ndisk and spheroid are indistinguishably old, with stellar populations dominated by median ages larger than 6 Gyr. They\nfind a metallicity of [Fe/H] \u223c \u22120.7 dex in the disk, in agreement with Ferguson & Johnson (2001). Interestingly, their\noutermost disk fields, which are comparable in radial distance\nto our field F2, have a 10% population of 1 Gyr or younger\nstars, more young stars than in their inner fields.\nThe most extensive study about the disk of M31 was done\nby Brown et al. (2006). They used deep HST ACS observations of three fields in M31, one located on the disk at \u223c 25\nkpc from the center of the galaxy, one in the spheroid, and one\ntidal stream field. Their data reach stars well below the oldest MSTO, which allowed them to derive the complete star\nformation history in those fields. Regarding the outer disk\nfield, they found a broad RGB, which suggests a wide range\nof metallicity. They failed to find a significant old metal-poor\npopulation in the disk of M31, due to the small amount of\nblue HB stars. The detection of a BP indicates that there is at\nleast some very young population, with ages of 0.2 \u2013 1 Gyr,\nin agreement with Olsen et al. (2006). After quantitatively\nfitting their CMDs, Brown et al. concluded that the outer\ndisk population is dominated by stars of 4\u20138 Gyr, with a mean\nage of 7.5 Gyr and a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = \u22120.2 dex.\nIf the contamination from their spheroid field population is\ntaken into account, they found a younger mean age (6.6 Gyr)\nand a higher mean metallicity ([Fe/H] = +0.1 dex). Thus the\nspheroid contamination almost completely accounts for the\nold and metal-poor stars in the outer disk. Note, however, that\ngiven the wide separation between their fields, they cannot\nbe assured that their spheroidal field is representative of the\nunderlying spheroid in the disk field.\nIn general, the stellar populations we find in F2 agree with\nprevious studies of M31. In particular, the MDF that we\nhave obtained for M31 agrees very well with the findings by\nWilliams (2002), with a peak at [Fe/H] > \u22120.5 dex and devoid\nof stars with metallicities lower than [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.0 dex. The\nlack of a significant amount of metal-poor stars is a common\nproperty found in all the studies just discussed. Our metallicity peak is, however, slightly more metal-poor than that\n\n27\n\nobtained by Worthey et al. (2005) and Brown et al. (2006),\nand slightly more metal-rich than the value obtained by Olsen\net al. (2006). Hence, the possibility raised above that field F2\ncontains stripped M32 stars is unlikely. A more quantitative\nstudy of the stellar populations in F2 will be presented in a\nfollow-up paper.\n8. SUMMARY\n\nDeep F435W (\u223c B), F555W (\u223c V ) observations of two\nfields located at \u223c 11000 (M32 field F1) and \u223c 32000 (M31\nbackground field F2) from the nucleus of M32 were made using ACS/HRC on board HST. The location of the M32 field\nwas chosen so that both the image crowding and contamination from M31 disk were as minimal as possible. The M31\nbackground field was located at the same M31 isophotal level\nof our M32 field, in order to allow the photometry of M32 to\nbe properly corrected for the M31 background. Photometry of\nthese images was performed using two different techniques:\naperture photometry applied to the images deconvolved by a\nPSF and the DAOPHOT II stand-alone packages. Photometry\non deconvolved images has been shown to do a significantly\nbetter job in resolving blends and thus we used its results for\nanalyzing the data. Before any analysis was done, extensive\nASTs were performed to understand completeness and crowding in our fields. The results from the completeness and error analysis were used to statistically decontaminate M32 for\nthe contribution of M31 light and thus the different crowding\nbetween the fields were taken into account when decontaminating. Unfortunately, the severe crowding prohibits us from\nreaching the oldest MSTOs of M32, and we were forced to\nassume that all stars fainter than F555W \u223c 28 are products\nof blends. Nevertheless the photometry here is significantly\ndeeper (by at least 2 mag) than any other obtained so far for\nsimilar field positions and we are able to analyze the stellar\npopulations of M32. Based on the CMD of M32 we conclude\nthe following:\n\u2022 We find that the core-helium burning stars are concentrated in a red clump, as expected for a metal-rich system and consistent with results from both spectral analysis and photometric studies. By using the mean color\nand magnitude of the RC, we obtain a mean age of 8\u201310\nGyr for a metallicity of [M/H] \u223c \u22120.2 in M32.\n\u2022 We report the detection of the RGB bump and the AGB\nbump in M32 for the first time. We use their positions in\nthe CMD relative to the position in color and magnitude\nof the RC to constrain the mean age and metallicity of\nthe population. We find that the mean metallicity of\nM32 is higher than [M/H] \u223c \u22120.4 dex, in agreement\nwith the RGB results, and that the mean age from this\nmethod is between 5 and 10 Gyr.\n\u2022 The metallicity distribution of M32 inferred from the\nCMD has its peak at [M/H] \u223c \u22120.2 dex. Overall, the\nmetallicity distribution function implies that there are\nmore metal-rich stars than metal-poor ones. We find\nthat metal-poor stars with [M/H] < \u22121.2 contribute\nvery little, at most 6% of the total V -light or 4.5% of\nthe total mass in our M32 field, implying that the enrichment process largely avoided the metal poor stage.\n\u2022 Bright AGB stars at F555W < 24, i.e. above the TRGB,\nconfirm the presence of an intermediate-age population\nin M32 (ages of 4\u00b13 Gyr).\n\n\f28\n\nMonachesi et al.\n\u2022 The observed blue plume is a genuine blue plume and\nnot an artifact of crowding. It contains stars as young\nas \u223c 0.5 Gyr. The detected blue loop having stars with\nmasses of \u223c 2 \u2212 3 M and ages between \u223c 0.3 and \u223c\n1 Gyr, as well as the possible presence of a bright SGB\nare different manifestations of the presence of a young\npopulation. However, it is likely that this young population belongs to the disk of M31 rather than to M32. The\nfainter portion of the blue plume (F555W > 26) does\nbelong to M32 and it indicates the presence of stars between 1 and 2 Gyr or/and the first direct evidence of\nblue straggler stars in M32.\n\u2022 We do not observe either a significant BHB or the oldest\nMSTO, but studies in our fields have found RR Lyrae\nstars in M32, hence confirming the presence of an ancient metal-poor population with our data.\n\u2022 We note that in general the CMDs of both fields F1 and\nF2 present an unexpectedly similar morphology. By\nsubtracting the normalized F1 CMD from the F2 one,\nwe see that there are subtle differences, such that M31\nappears to have a younger and more metal-poor population than M32, and M32 appears to have a more predominant intermediate age population.\n\u2022 The CMD of our background field F2 exhibits a wide\nRGB, indicative of a metallicity spread with its peak\nat [M/H] \u223c \u22120.4 dex. The presence of a blue plume\nindicates the presence of stars as young as 0.3 Gyr. We\nhave also detected bright AGB stars which reveal the\npresence of intermediate-age population in M31.\n\u2022 We have calculated the distance to M32 using the RC\nstars. We obtained a distance modulus of \u03bc0 = 24.53 \u00b1\n0.12 which agrees with previous results. This estimate is comparable to the distance modulus obtained\nfor M31, \u03bc0 = 24.45 \u00b1 0.12, also using the RC stars.\nHence, within the errors we cannot conclude whether\nM32 is situated in front of or behind M31.\n\nM32 clearly has a complex SFH: it is dominated by metalrich intermediate-age stars and it contains some, but few, old,\nmetal-poor stars as well as possible young populations. M32\nappears to be a normal, low-luminosity elliptical (Kormendy\net al. 2009). However, the model proposed by Bekki et al.\n(2001) of M32 as a tidally-stripped, low-luminosity, earlytype spiral galaxy cannot be ruled out with our data. Whatever its formation history, we can still attempt to place M32's\nSFH into a cosmological context. F1's dominant population\nhas an age of 8\u201310 Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift\nof 1 . z f . 2 (for the cosmology of Komatsu et al. 2010).\n\nM32's total stellar mass can be inferred from the values in\nTable 1 of Cappellari et al. (2006) to be M\u2217 = 108.66 M . If\nwe assume that, say, 90% of M32's stellar mass was formed\nuniformly in the interval of 8\u201310 Gyr ago (assumptions that\nwill be tested when we complete our detailed analysis of the\nSFH from the CMD), we derive a specific star formation rate\nSSFR = SFR/M\u2217 \u223c 0.45 Gyr\u22121 -typical of or perhaps even\nslightly lower than the observed specific star formation rates\nin galaxies with mass \u223c 109 M at 1 . z . 2 (e.g. Noeske et al.\n2007; Santini et al. 2009). Our observations of M32 thus represent a \"ground-truth\" of the downsizing of star formation in\ngalaxies (see, e.g., Cowie et al. 1996; Fontanot et al. 2009):\na low-mass early-type galaxy forming the majority of stars at\nlower redshifts than the peak of the Universe's star formation\nrate density (e.g., Hopkins & Beacom 2006).\nIn spite of the fact that we do not reach the oldest MSTOs,\nour new photometric results dramatically improve our understanding of the stellar composition of M32. Synthetic stellar\npopulation models ought to be able to reproduce all the features we presented in this work. We note once again that M32\nis the only system with properties similar to normal elliptical\ngalaxies close enough for which a direct comparison between\nresolved intrinsically faint individual stars and stellar population models of integrated light can currently be obtained. A\nfollow-up paper will present a detailed analysis of the recent\nand intermediate SFH obtained from these data. Its subsequent implications on the formation and evolution of M32,\nand the different proposed models about its origins, will be\nfurther tested and discussed there.\nAM is grateful to Carme Gallart for very valuable discussions.

The images\nare already calibrated using the standard pipeline data processing. Figure 1 shows the location of the F3, F4, F5 and F6 fields we\nhave analyzed for this purpose and Table 6 summarizes the information regarding to these archival observations. Note that these\nfields, except F3, should have a small fractional light contribution of M32 compared to that of M31. In fact F4, the nearest field\nto the center of M32 after F3, contains our F2 background field, implying that M31 dominates over M32 at that position.\nFor each of these fields, stellar photometry was performed simultaneously on all available images using HSTphot (Dolphin\n2000), a package specifically designed for use on HST WFPC2 images. Before running HSTphot several pre-processing steps\nwere done on each individual image for each of the fields. All the routines are described in detail in Dolphin (2000) and the\nHSTphot manual. Briefly, each image was first masked, using the data quality image included in the HSTphot mask routine;\nwe next made an initial sky estimate using the routine getsky; after that we removed cosmic rays using crmask and used\nthe routine hotpixels to mask hot pixels that differ significantly in value from their neighbors. Finally, all the images per\nfield were run together in the hstphot photometry routine. The output of this routine was a list of magnitudes and positions\nfor each stellar-like object as well as several some global and individual frame solution information that includes a goodnessof-fit parameter, sharpness, roundness, and object type. We kept objects that were classified as good stars, having \u03c7 < 4 and\n\u22120.5 . sharpness . 0.5. The magnitudes are given in both the WFPC2 photometric system with the applied calibrations of\nDolphin (2000) and the UBVRI system using the color transformations of Holtzman et al. (1995). To understand completeness\nin these data we have run ASTs on each of the fields. HSTphot contains an AST routine which distributes a grid of artificial\nstars generated on a two-dimensional CMD according the flux of the image. Details about how ASTs work in HSTphot can be\nfound in Holtzman et al. (2006). In short, the AST routine is a post-processing step of the photometry; the artificial stars are\ntreated in absence of neighbors, i.e. real stars, and thus crowding is not taken into account. In order to compensate for this\nproblem, we have compared the output magnitude of each fake recovered star with the magnitudes of real stars that are within 2\npixels of its position. We have only kept the fake star as recovered if it contributes most of the light (Holtzman et al. 2006). We\nhave performed 100 ASTs on each image, injecting \u223c 5000 stars per AST. We have located the artificial stars on the CMD with\n20 < V < 29 and \u22121 < (V \u2212 I) < 4 distributed according to the flux of the image.\nFigure 22 shows the (F606W \u2212 F814W , F606W ) CMDs for each of the outlying fields. The main features in these CMDs are\nthe RGB and the TRGB. We can also see that a blue plume is present in all the fields above the 50% completeness level, which\nis indicated as a dashed line in each of the CMD. Note that F5 and F6 have a 50% completeness level at a fainter magnitude than\nF3 and F4. This is probably due to the fact that there is less crowding, as expected for these fields which are located further away\nfrom the center of M32 than F3 and F4, and their exposure times were longer.\nTo analyze the relative significance of the BP between the fields, we have counted their blue plume stars as follows. For each\nfield, we defined a box in such a way that only BP stars that are over the 50% completeness level are inside. This box is different\nin each field, given that the completeness levels are not exactly always the same. We then divided the number of stars in this box\nby the RGB stars that are also over the 50% completeness level, obtaining thus a specific frequency of blue plume stars per field.\nBoth the specific frequency of blue plume stars and the angular distances of each field to M32 center are indicated in Table 6 as\n\"f\" and \"d\" respectively. An example of how the BP stars box was defined is shown for F3 in the Figure 23. Padova isochrones\n(Marigo et al. 2008; Girardi et al. 2008) having ages of 0.08, 0.2 and 0.3 Gyr and a metallicity of Z = 0.009 are superimposed\non the CMD corrected for reddening E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.08 (Burstein & Heiles 1982) and a true distance modulus of \u03bc0 = 24.53 (this\npaper). We can see that they fit the data very well suggesting that a young population is the origin of the blue plume. Finally, we\ncompared the specific frequency of blue plume stars between the fields and we found that the value increases for the fields closer\nto the center of M32, where the contribution from M32 becomes significant. This suggests that the blue plume truly belongs to\nM32 and is not due solely to the blue plume seen in M31 fields.\nThus, it remains as an open question as to why the BP in M32 was not seen in earlier optical data. The fact that the B band\nhas not been previously observed but just the V and I cannot be reason because the BP is clearly visible in the V I archival\nobservations shown in Figure 22 and in Alonso-Garc\u00eda et al. (2004). The BP was not however seen in G96, who observed with\nthe same WFPC2 camera. However, the G96 data are closer to the center of M32 than those of Alonso-Garc\u00eda et al. It is likely\nthat the extreme crowding affecting the region of interest made the detection of the blue plume impossible in previous works.\nIn this context it is interesting to compare M32 with the dwarf elliptical (dE) NGC 205, also satellite of M31, which has been\nknown to have blue OB-type stars since Baade (1951, see also Hodge 1973 and references therein). Only recently has there\nbeen a significant and genuine population of young blue stars observed in its center using ACS/HRC data (Monaco et al. 2009).\nPrevious works of this galaxy have shown no BP stars, or some blue stars in the WFPC2 V I data (see Butler & Mart\u00ednez-Delgado\n\n\fThe deepest HST CMD of M32\n\n31\n\nTABLE 6\nA RCHIVAL OBSERVATIONS OF FIELDS IN M32\nField\nF3\nF4\nF5\nF6\n\nProposal ID\n\nP.I.\n\n\u03b1J2000.0\n\n\u03b4J2000.0\n\ntF606W (s) a\n\ntF814W (s) b\n\nNstars\n\nd(0 )c\n\nfd\n\nGO6664\nGTO7566\nGO9392\nGO9392\n\nG.
