Introduction\nIt is well known that the Doppler effect due to the relative motion between a transmitter\nand a receiver causes a shift in the received frequency of electromagnetic or acoustic wave.\nThe Doppler effect has been applied by Ives and Stilwell to deal with the frequency shift\nin the light emitted from a fast-moving hydrogen atomic beam [1]. However, it was found\nthat the observed frequency shift agrees with the Doppler effect only to the first order of\nthe atom speed normalized to the speed of light c. In order to account for the observed shift\ncorrectly to the second order, a hypothesis of Larmor and Lorentz was adopted, which states\nthat\npthe frequency of a wave radiated from a moving source of speed v is altered by a factor\nof 1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 [1]. It is noted that this speed-dependent factor is identical to the one in the\nfamous Lorentz mass-variation law. Presently, an almost unanimously accepted explanation\nof this additional frequency shift is provided by Einstein's special relativity, whereby a\nsecond-order Doppler effect has been derived based on the Lorentz transformation of space\nand time [2]. Thus it seems to imply that the frequency shift to the second order between a\ntransmitter and a receiver in relative motion is purely a kinematical property. And, for the\ncase of resonant absorption between moving atoms or ions, it seems to assume tacitly that the\ntransition frequencies of the emitting or the absorbing atoms in motion remain unchanged,\nin spite of the well-known fact that the electronic quantum states in atoms depend on the\nmass of electron, which in turn depends on the particle speed. Furthermore, in the common\nunderstanding the speed v which determines the second-order Doppler frequency shift by\nthe mass-variation factor is the relative speed between the transmitter and the receiver.\nHowever, in the Hafele-Keating experiment with circumnavigating atomic clocks and in the\nGPS (global positioning system) with atomic clocks onboard the orbiting satellites, it has\nbeen demonstrated with a high precision that the speed which determines the transition\nfrequency and clock rate by the mass-variation factor is referred uniquely to an ECI (earthcentered inertial) frame [3]. Thus there seems to exist a discrepancy in the reference frame\nfor the speed in the mass-variation factor.\nRecently, we have presented the local-ether model of propagation of electromagnetic\nwave [4]. It is supposed that electromagnetic wave propagates via a medium like the ether.\nHowever, the ether is not universal. Specifically, it is supposed that in the region under\n\n1\n\n\fsufficient influence of the gravity due to the Earth, the Sun, or another celestial body, there\nforms a local ether which as well as the associated gravitational potential moves with the\nrespective body. Within each local ether, it is proposed that as in the classical propagation\nmodel, electromagnetic wave propagates at the speed of light c with respect to the associated\nlocal ether, independent of the motions of source and receiver. Thereby, for earthbound or\ninterplanetary waves, the propagation is referred specifically to a geocentric or a heliocentric\ninertial frame, respectively. This local-ether model has been adopted to account for the\neffects of earth's motions in a wide variety of propagation phenomena, particularly the\nSagnac correction in GPS, the time comparison via intercontinental microwave link, and\nthe echo time in interplanetary radar. As examined within the present accuracy, the localether model is still in accord with the Michelson-Morley experiment which is known to\nmake the classical ether notion obsolete. Furthermore, by modifying the speed of light in a\ngravitational potential, this simple propagation model leads to the deflection of light by the\nSun and the increment in the interplanetary radar echo time which are important phenomena\nsupporting the general theory of relativity. Moreover, based on this new classical model,\nthe first-order Doppler frequency shift has been derived to account for the anisotropy in\nantenna temperature of CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation), the shift in the\nspectrum of light radiated from a moving star, and the seasonal variation of eclipse intervals\nin Roemer's observations of Jupiter's moons [4].\nFurther, the matter wave associated with a particle has been supposed to follow the\nlocal-ether model and be governed by a wave equation incorporating a natural frequency\nand the electric scalar potential [3]. From the local-ether wave equation, a first-order time\nevolution equation similar to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is derived. From the electrostatic force\nderived from this evolution equation, it has been found that the rest mass of a particle\nis just the natural frequency, aside from a scaling factor. That is, the inertial mass of a\nparticle originates from the natural frequency and hence from the temporal variation of\nthe associated matter wave. Furthermore, due to the dispersion of matter wave, it has\nbeen derived that the mass of the particle and the angular frequency of the matter wave\nincrease with the particle speed by the famous Lorentz mass-variation factor, except that\nthe speed is referred specifically to the associated local-ether frame. A feature different\nfrom Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is that the time derivative in the local-ether evolution equation\nincorporates an extra multiplying term of the ratio of the speed-dependent angular frequency\nto the natural frequency. As a consequence, it has been found that the energies of quantum\nstates of the matter wave bounded in an atom decrease with the inverse of the speeddependent mass [3]. Thus the transition frequency and the atomic clock rate decrease with\nthe atom speed by the mass-variation factor. Thereby, the frequency variation associated\nwith the speed-dependent mass-variation factor has been derived as an intrinsic quantum\nproperty of the matter wave bounded in atom. Similarly, the gravitational redshift has been\nderived as an effect of the gravitational potential on the quantum energy. Anyway, the\ndependence of quantum energy on speed can be expected at least for hydrogen-like atoms.\nSince it is well known in standard textbooks on quantum mechanics that the electronic\nquantum states in such an atom depend on the mass of electron, which in turn has been\nknown to depend on speed. However, according to the local-ether model, the atom speed\nthat determines the mass variation is referred uniquely to an ECI (earth-centered inertial)\nframe for earthbound atoms. Thus the quantum energy and hence the atomic clock rate tend\nto depend on earth's rotation, but is entirely independent of earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun or others. This consequence has been used to account for the east-west directional\nanisotropy in the Hafele-Keating experiment, the synchronism among GPS atomic clocks,\nand for the spatial isotropy in the Hughes-Drever experiment [3].\nIn this investigation, based on the local-ether propagation model, a higher-order Doppler\nfrequency shift for electromagnetic wave is derived. Further, by taking the speed-dependent\nvariation of quantum energy of matter wave into account, we present a resonant-absorption\ncondition between moving emitting and absorbing atoms. Then this frequency relation is\napplied to deal with various experiments consistently, including the Ives-Stilwell experiment,\n2\n\n\fthe output frequency from ammonia masers, and the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment. Moreover, we examine the spatial isotropy, Galilean relativity, and their breakdowns in these\nexperiments.\n\n2. Higher-Order Doppler Frequency Shift\nIn this section, based on the local-ether model of wave propagation, the Doppler frequency shift is given to higher orders. Consider the case where both the source and the\nreceiver are located within the same local ether and are moving at velocities vs and ve\nwith respect to this local-ether frame, respectively. According to the classical propagation\nmodel, the propagation time \u03c4 is the propagation range R divided by the isotropic speed\nc as \u03c4 = R/c. It is important to note that the propagation range is the distance from the\nposition of the source at the instant of wave emission to the one of the receiver at the instant\nof reception, as viewed in the local-ether frame. Thus the propagation range and hence the\npropagation time depend on the velocity ve and the acceleration ae of the receiver with\nrespect to the local-ether frame. Quantitatively, when \u03c4 is short, the propagation range is\ngiven implicitly by\nR2\nR\n(1)\nR = Rt + ve + ae 2 ,\nc\n2c\nwhere Rt is the directed propagation-path length from the source to the receiver both at\nthe instant of emission. It can be shown that to the second order of normalized speed, the\npropagation range can be given explicitly in terms of the path length Rt by [4]\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0001\n1\n1\n2\n2\n(2)\nR = Rt 1 + ue + 2 ue + ve + ae * Rt ,\nc\n2c\nwhere radial speed u (= v * R\u0302t ) is the component of velocity v along Rt and the unit vector\nR\u0302t = Rt /Rt .\nConsider the Doppler effect for the case where the source is emitting wave periodically\nand is moving with respect to the receiver. Due to the motions of the transmitter and\nreceiver, the rate of reception tends to be different from the one of emission. As discussed\nin [4], the received time difference \u25b3t between two signals transmitted with a differential\ntime difference \u25b3t\u2032 can be given in terms of the difference in the propagation range by\n\u25b3t = \u25b3t\u2032 +\n\nR(t\u2032 + \u25b3t\u2032 ) R(t\u2032 )\n\u2212\n,\nc\nc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere R(t) denotes the propagation range for the wave emitted at an arbitrary instant t.\nThen the received frequency fr and the transmitted frequency ft are related by\nft\n\u25b3t\ndR\n=\n=1+\n,\n\u2032\nfr\n\u25b3t\ncdt\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the time derivative of the propagation range is evaluated at the instant of wave\nemission.\nThe second-order Doppler effect can be given if the first-order formula of the propagation\nrange is used. By so doing, the Doppler frequency relation becomes\ndRt\nd\nft\n=1+\n+ 2 (ve * Rt ).\nfr\ncdt\nc dt\n\n(5)\n\nDue to the relative motion between source and receiver, dRt /dt = ves and hence dRt /dt =\nues , where ves (= ve \u2212 vs ) is the Newtonian relative velocity between receiver and source at\nthe instant of emission and ues (= ue \u2212 us ) is the radial speed of the receiver with respect\nto the source. Thus, as given in [4], the second-order Doppler frequency relation becomes\nues\nae * Rt\nve * ves\nft\n=1+\n+\n.\n+\nfr\nc\nc2\nc2\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fIt is noted that the transverse components of velocities are also involved in the second-order\nDoppler shift. To the second order of normalized speed, the inverse frequency ratio reads\nues\nae * Rt\nu2\nve * ves\nfr\n=1\u2212\n\u2212\n+ es\n.\n\u2212\n2\n2\nft\nc\nc\nc\nc2\n\n(7)\n\nWhen the third-order Doppler effect needs to be considered, the second-order formula of\nthe propagation range should be used, as discussed later.\n\n3. Quantum Energy Variation and Resonant-Absorption Condition\nBased on the local-ether wave equation, it has been found that the mass of a particle increases with its speed by the famous Lorentz mass-variation factor, except that the speed is\nreferred specifically to an ECI frame for earthbound particles [3]. From this wave equation a\nfirst-order time evolution equation is derived, which is similar to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation except that the time derivative is referred specifically to the local-ether frame and incorporates\nan extra multiplying term of the mass-variation factor. Thereby, a quantum-mechanical approach has been presented to show that the energies of quantum states of the matter wave\nbounded in an atom or a molecule decrease with the inverse of the speed-dependent mass.\nIt is known that the frequency of light emitted from or absorbed by an atom is equal to\nthe transition frequency, which in turn corresponds to the difference in energy between two\ninvolved quantum states. Thus the state transition frequency f of a moving atom decreases\nwith its speed by the speed-dependent mass-variation factor as [3]\np\nf = f0 1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 ,\n(8)\n\nwhere v is the atom speed referred to the local-ether frame which is an ECI frame for\nearthbound atoms, f0 is the rest transition frequency of an identical atom stationary in the\nlocal-ether frame, and the frequency f is observed in the atom frame (with respect to which\nthe atom is stationary) such that no Doppler shift is involved.\nThe atomic clock rate depends on the transition frequency of the associated atom and\nhence decreases with the atom speed by the mass-variation factor. The preceding speeddependent frequency-variation formula has been adopted in [3] to account for the east-west\ndirectional anisotropy in the clock rate demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment\nwith cesium atomic clocks onboard an aircraft undergoing circumnavigation [5]. In this\nexperiment the observed clock rate is determined from the number of the atomic clock ticks\nwhich in turn are detected and counted by a device which is comoving with the clock without\nrelative motion. Thus the clock rate is associated with the quantum energy variation, but\nhas nothing to do with the Doppler frequency shift. Moreover, it has been used to account\nfor the synchronism and the clock-rate adjustment in GPS atomic clocks onboard earth's\nsatellites in circular orbits.\nA speed-dependent frequency of the form of (8) (but of different physical origin and\nreference frame of speed) was first introduced by Fitzgerald, Lorentz, and Larmor before the\nadvent of the special relativity [6] and was later derived by assuming the length contraction\n[7] or the time dilation [2]. In the local-ether model, the frequency-variation formula due to\nthe quantum effect is not expected to hold in all energy states in all atoms and other forms\nof the speed-dependence are not precluded. This is in view of the complication that the\ninteractions which affect energy states are versatile, such as electronic or nuclear, electric or\nmagnetic, spin or orbital, and intrinsic or external. In [3], the frequency-variation formula\nis verified only for electronic states due to the electric scalar potential in an atom or a\nmolecule. Nevertheless, it is assumed that this formula holds in the experiments examined\nin this investigation.\nThen we proceed to consider the case where the source atom s and the receiver atom\ne are located within the same local ether but are moving respectively at velocities vs and\nve with respect to the local-ether frame. Due to the motions of the source and receiver,\nthe Doppler effect also causes a frequency shift. Suppose f0s and f0e are the rest transition\n4\n\n\ffrequencies of atoms s and e, respectively. The transmitted frequency ft of the wave emitted\nfrom the moving atom s is related to the rest transition frequency f0s as\np\n(9)\nft = f0s 1 \u2212 vs2 /c2 .\n\nOn the other hand, in order for the wave being resonantly absorbed by the moving atom e,\nthe rest transition frequency f0e should be related to the received frequency fr as\np\n(10)\nfr = f0e 1 \u2212 ve2 /c2 .\n\nThe received frequency fr and the transmitted frequency ft in turn are related to each other\nby the Doppler effect as shown in (6) or (7).\nThus, by taking both the Doppler frequency shift for electromagnetic wave and the quantum energy variation of matter wave into account, we arrive at the resonant-absorption\ncondition in terms of the rest transition frequencies f0s and f0e , which to the second order\nof normalized speed is given by\np\np\n\b\nf0e 1 \u2212 ve2 /c2 = f0s 1 \u2212 vs2 /c2 1 \u2212 ues /c \u2212 (ve * ves + ae * Rt \u2212 u2es )/c2 .\n(11)\n\nFor the case where the receiver is comoving with the source (ve = vs ) without acceleration,\nthe resonant-absorption condition becomes trivially as f0e = f0s . This resonant-absorption\ncondition made its debut in [8].\nWhen the resonant-absorption condition is not met, the off-resonance absorption tends\nto be much weaker. The deviation in frequency from the resonant-absorption condition is\ngiven by the difference between the received frequency and the transition frequencies of the\nabsorbing atoms in motion. That is,\np\n\u03b4f = fr \u2212 f0e 1 \u2212 ve2 /c2 .\n(12)\nBy using (9), the frequency deviation can be written as\n\u03b4f = \u25b3fD \u2212 \u25b3fQ ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u25b3fD and \u25b3fQ denote the frequency shifts due to the Doppler and the quantum\neffects and are given by\n\u25b3fD = fr \u2212 ft\n(14)\nand\n\u25b3fQ = f0e\n\np\np\n1 \u2212 ve2 /c2 \u2212 f0s 1 \u2212 vs2 /c2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nrespectively. In words, \u25b3fQ is the difference in the speed-dependent transition frequency\nbetween the receiver and source atoms in motion. From (4) it is seen that the fractional\nDoppler frequency shift is given by\ndR\n\u25b3fD\n=\u2212\n.\nfr\ncdt\n\n(16)\n\nThe resonant-absorption condition corresponds to the deviation \u03b4f = 0, which means that\nthe frequency shift due to the Doppler effect for electromagnetic wave propagating in free\nspace exactly cancels the one due to the quantum effect of matter wave bounded in atom.\n\n4. Reexamination of Resonant-Absorption Experiments\nBased on the local-ether model, we reexamine the resonant-absorption experiments reported in the literature. Thereby, we present reinterpretations of the Ives-Stilwell experiment, the output frequency from ammonia masers, and of the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment\nand explore the associated spatial isotropy, Galilean relativity, and their breakdowns. The\nfirst experiment is associated with a radial relative motion (ues \u2243 \u00b1ves ) and the last two\nare with a transverse relative motion (ues = 0).\n5\n\n\f4.1. Ives-Stilwell experiment\nConsider the case where the source is moving at a velocity vs and the receiver is stationary, both with respect to the local-ether frame. Thus ae = 0, ve = 0, and ues = \u2212us .\nThen the second-order resonant-absorption condition becomes a simpler form of\np\n1 \u2212 vs2 /c2\n.\n(17)\nf0e = f0s\n1 \u2212 us /c\nFor this case fr = f0e and thus this formula is identical to that derived in different ways based\non the transformation of four-vectors [9] or on the time dilation [2], except the difference in\nreference frame of velocity vs . According to the local-ether model, the term (1 \u2212 us /c) in\nthe preceding\nformula is due to the Doppler frequency shift to the second order, while the\np\nterm 1 \u2212 vs2 /c2 is due to the quantum energy variation.\nA similar frequency shift has been demonstrated in the Ives-Stilwell experiment, where\nlight is emitted from fast-moving hydrogen atoms in an excited state and is absorbed by a\nspectrograph used to measure the received frequency [1, 10]. The radiation from the moving\natoms is reflected from two mirrors and then the two reflected light beams are guided to\na photographic plate where the frequencies are recorded for measurement and comparison.\nThe two mirrors are arranged in such a way that the atoms are moving toward one of them\nand away from the other [10]. Due to the Doppler effect with the relative motions between\nthe emitting atoms and the mirrors, the light beams reflected from the mirrors tend to shift\nin frequency. However, by virtue of no relative motions among the mirrors, the spectrograph,\nand the other components of experimental setup, no further Doppler effect is introduced\nafter the reflection.\nNote that even for a geostationary experimental setup, the receiver is not stationary with\nrespect to the associated local-ether frame due to earth's rotation. Consider the laboratory\nframe in which the setup and the receiver are stationary. Suppose that the emitting atoms\nare moving at a velocity vt with respect to the laboratory frame, which in turn moves at\na velocity v0 with respect to an ECI frame. Thus ve = v0 , vs = vt + v0 , and ves = \u2212vt .\nIn the experiment the atoms move nearly in the radial direction and the directions of the\ntwo propagation paths are antiparallel. Thus ues = \u2213vt cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 denotes the small\nangle of vt from R\u0302t , \u00b1R\u0302t represents the direction from the emitting atoms to the reflecting\npoint on either mirror, and the upper or the lower sign applies for the light beam reflected\nfrom the mirror which the atoms approach or recede from, respectively. Then the resonantabsorption condition (11) leads to that the received frequencies for the two reflected light\nbeams are\np\n\b\n(18)\nfr\u00b1 = f0s 1 \u2212 (vt + v0 )2 /c2 1 \u00b1 vt cos \u03b8/c + (v0 * vt + vt2 cos2 \u03b8)/c2 .\nIt is noted that the first-order term is independent of the laboratory velocity v0 . If the\nvelocity v0 is neglected, the preceding formula reduces to (17).\nTo the second order of normalized speed, the received frequencies become\n\b\n\u22121\n.\n(19)\nfr\u00b1 = f0s 1 \u2213 vt cos \u03b8/c + (vt2 + v02 )/2c2\nBoth the Doppler and the quantum effects contribute to the second-order terms. It is noted\nthat the dot-product term v0 *vt appears both in the Doppler and the quantum effects and\nthen cancels out. In the Ives-Stilwell experiment the speed vt of hydrogen atoms is of the\norder of 106 m/sec, which is achieved by electrostatically accelerating hydrogen ions with\na voltage of tens of kV. Thus the atom speed vt is much higher than the laboratory speed\nv0 which is due to earth's rotation and, perhaps, to the motion of a vehicle carrying the\nexperimental setup. Thus the preceding frequency formula can be substantially independent\nof the laboratory velocity v0 .\nThe first- and the second-order fractional frequency shifts are associated with the difference between and with the sum of the two received frequencies, respectively. Thus, in\n6\n\n\fterms of wavelengths, the normalized speed and its square can be given by\nvt\n1 \u03bbR \u2212 \u03bbB\n=\nc\n2 cos \u03b8\n\u03bb0\nand\n\nvt2\n=\nc2\n\n\u0012\n\nv2\n\u03bbR + \u03bbB\n\u2212 2 \u2212 02\n\u03bb0\nc\n\n(20)\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bbB = c/fr+ , \u03bbR = c/fr\u2212 , and \u03bb0 = c/f0s . By measuring \u03bbR and \u03bbB , the first- and\nthe second-order fractional shifts can be calculated and compared, with a knowledge of \u03b8,\n\u03bb0 , and v0 . This provides a crucial means to test the minor second-order frequency shift. It\ncan be expected that the deviation of the sum \u03bbR + \u03bbB from 2\u03bb0 is quite small. By using\na high-precision spectrograph, it has been measured that \u03bbR = 6618.808 (in angstrom) and\n\u03bbB = 6507.253 [10]. Meanwhile, it is known that \u03bb0 = 6562.793 and \u03b8 = 0.075 (in rad).\nThen formulas (20) and (21) lead to vt2 /c2 = 7.26 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 7.24\u00d710\u22125, respectively,\nwhere the term v02 /c2 is as small as 10\u221212 and hence is omitted. The agreement between the\ntwo data is quite good, since the discrepancy is as small as the round-off in the calculation.\nAccording to the local-ether model, the wavelength \u03bb0 corresponds to a transition frequency\nof a hydrogen atom stationary with respect to an ECI frame. This seems to be in accord\nwith the description that \u03bb0 is the wavelength of the H\u03b1 line of the Balmer series observed\nin a reference frame at rest with respect to the radiating atom [10]. However, the value of \u03bb0\ncould be actually measured from geostationary atoms in a geostationary laboratory. Even\nso, the fractional discrepancy in \u03bb0 due to the difference in reference frame is also of the\norder of v02 /c2 . Thus the local-ether model is in accord with the self-consistency between the\nfirst- and the second-order frequency shifts demonstrated in the Ives-Stilwell experiment.\n4.2. Output frequency from ammonia masers\nNext, we consider the case where the source is moving transverse to the propagation\npath. In the ammonia maser, the molecular beam is injected into a resonant cavity and\nemits microwave due to quantum state transition [11, 2]. The output of the microwave comes\nthrough a waveguide coupled to the cavity via a small aperture. Suppose that the cavity\nand the receiver are stationary in the laboratory frame of velocity v0 and that the emitting\nammonia molecular beam moves at a velocity vt with respect to the cavity. Moreover,\nsuppose that the output waveguide is thin and long and is positioned with its longitudinal\naxis being perpendicular to the direction of molecular beam represented by vt . Thus the\ndirection of the propagation path of the microwave is virtually parallel to the longitudinal\naxis of the output waveguide and hence is transverse to the molecule velocity, that is,\nvt *R\u0302t = 0.\nThus ve = v0 , ae = 0, vs = vt + v0 , ves = \u2212vt , and ues = 0. Then the resonantabsorption condition (11) leads to the received frequency\np\n\b\n(22)\nfr = f0s 1 \u2212 (vt + v0 )2 /c2 1 + v0 * vt /c2 .\nThe Doppler effect is presented by the dot-product term v0 *vt . Thus, by taking both the\nDoppler and the quantum effects into account, the resonant-absorption condition leads to\nthat the received frequency at the output waveguide of the maser is given by\nfr\nv2 + v2\n= 1\u2212 t 2 0.\nf0s\n2c\n\n(23)\n\nIt is noted again that the dot-product term v0 *vt appears both in the Doppler and the\nquantum effects and then cancels out. Consequently, the output frequency from the maser\nis independent of the directions of velocities vt and v0 . Moreover, the resonant-absorption\ncondition leads to\nv2\nf0e\n= 1 \u2212 t2 .\n(24)\nf0s\n2c\n7\n\n\fIt is seen that this frequency relation is even independent of the laboratory velocity v0 .\nIt is noticed that a term quite similar to the second-order Doppler effect in (22) has\nbeen derived alternatively from a classical approach, aside from the reference frame of the\nlaboratory velocity [11, 2]. Further, a similar cancellation of the terms associated with v0 has\nbeen accounted for by an alternative approach, where a speed-dependent frequency based\non the time dilation is used [12]. Anyway, it has been demonstrated experimentally that the\nbeat frequency between two masers with molecular beams moving in opposite directions is\nsubstantially zero and is almost independent of earth's motions [11]. Thus the local-ether\nmodel is in accord with the experiments with ammonia masers.\n4.3. M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment\nThen we consider the case where both the source and the absorber are moving in the\nlaboratory frame. The M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment is based on the recoilless gamma-ray\nnuclear resonance absorption known as the M\u00f6ssbauer effect [13-17]. The source and the\nabsorber of gamma ray are placed separately on a rotating rod. Both the quantum energy\nvariation of nuclear states and the Doppler frequency shift of wave propagation cause the\nfrequency shift. A frequency deviation from the resonant-absorption condition exhibits itself\nwith an increase in the scattering of gamma ray, which in turn can be measured by counters\nfixed at the laboratory or at the rod.\nSuppose that the absorber and the source atoms in the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment\nrotate about an axis with linear velocities vr and vt , respectively, where the axis is stationary\nin a laboratory frame which in turn moves at a velocity v0 with respect to the local-ether\nframe. In the rotor experiment, the directed path length Rt from the source to the absorber\nis always perpendicular both to vr and vt . Moreover, the path length Rt is fixed, while the\ndirection R\u0302t is changing with time. Thus dRt /dt = 0 and dRt /dt = vrt , where vrt = vr \u2212vt .\nTo the second order of normalized speed, the fractional Doppler frequency shift (16) due\nto the motions of the source and receiver becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nv0 * vrt\nd\n\u25b3fD\nRt + v0 * Rt = \u2212\n=\u2212\n,\n(25)\nfr\ncdt\nc\nc2\nwhere the orthogonality vr *Rt = 0 has been made use of and the derivative dv0 /dt is\nomitted. It is seen that this frequency shift depends on the laboratory velocity v0 . It is\nnoted that due to the path length Rt being a constant, the first-order term of normalized\nspeed vanishes in the preceding formula. Thus, to the third order of normalized speed, the\nfractional shift \u25b3fD /f0e is identical to the preceding formula of \u25b3fD /fr .\nConsider the case where the source and the absorber have the identical rest transition\nfrequency f0 . Thus the fractional frequency shift due to the quantum effect is\np\np\n\u25b3fQ\n1\n= 1 \u2212 (vr + v0 )2 /c2 \u2212 1 \u2212 (vt + v0 )2 /c2 \u2243 2 (\u22122vrt * v0 \u2212 vr2 + vt2 ).\nf0\n2c\n\n(26)\n\nIt is noted that the dot-product term vrt *v0 appears again. Consequently, by taking both\nthe Doppler and the quantum effects into account to the second order of normalized speed,\nthe fractional frequency deviation from the resonant absorption is\nv2 \u2212 v2\n\u03b4f\n= r 2 t.\nf0\n2c\n\n(27)\n\nIt is noted that the dot-product term v0 *vrt cancels out and hence the frequency deviation is\nindependent of the directions of velocities vr and vt . Furthermore, this frequency deviation\nis independent of the laboratory velocity v0 .\nIt is noticed again that a term quite similar to the second-order Doppler effect in (25)\nhas been derived alternatively from a classical approach, aside from the reference frame\nof the laboratory velocity [14, 16, 17]. Further, a similar cancellation of the terms with\nv0 has been accounted for by an alternative approach, where a speed-dependent frequency\n8\n\n\fbased on the length contraction is used [16]. Anyway, this fractional frequency deviation has\nbeen demonstrated in experiments with various rotation rates and various positions of the\nsource and the absorber at the rod [13-15]. Moreover, it has been found that between the two\ngeostationary counters oriented to detect the gamma rays propagating south- and northward,\nrespectively, there is no substantial difference in the measured frequency deviation [14]. Thus\nthe frequency deviation can be independent of the orientation of counter. Based on these,\nthe local-ether model is also in accord with the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment.\n4.4. Spatial isotropy, Galilean relativity, and their breakdowns\nAccording to the local-ether model, the speed of an earthbound atom is referred to\nan ECI frame. Thus the quantum energy in an atom is entirely independent of earth's\norbital motion around the Sun or whatever. Further, the quantum energy can even be\nindependent of earth's rotation, if the atom speed remains a constant during the rotation.\nSuch a constant-speed condition is met by a geostationary atom, by an atom moving at a\nfixed velocity with respect to ground at a substantially fixed latitude, or by an atom moving\nin a circular satellite orbit around the Earth. For an atom satisfying the constant-speed\ncondition, the energies of quantum states and hence the transition frequency between two\nstates are independent of the orientation and position of the Earth in space, whatever the\ndependence of quantum energy on the speed. This spatial isotropy of transition frequency\nwith respect to earth's motions has been adopted in [3] to account for the hourly and daily\nfrequency stability in geostationary atoms in the Hughes-Drever experiment [18] and for the\nhigh synchronism among the various GPS atomic clocks moving in circular orbits [19]. On\nthe other hand, for two atomic clocks moving even at an identical speed but in different\ndirections with respect to the ground, their speeds with respect to an ECI frame tend to be\ndifferent. Thereby, this isotropy breaks down, as demonstrated in the east-west directional\nanisotropy in atomic clock rate in the Hafele-Keating experiment [5].\nThe applicability of the aforementioned spatial isotropy can be extended to the cases\nwhere electromagnetic wave as well as matter wave is involved. According to the local-ether\nmodel, the results of an earthbound experiment are entirely independent of earth's orbital\nmotion. Further, the results can be independent of earth's rotation, so long as the atom\nspeeds ve , vs , ue , and us along with the terms ve *vs and ae *Rt are invariant under earth's\nrotation. Thereby, the frequency-variation formula (8), the propagation-range formula (2),\nand the resonant-absorption condition (11) remain unchanged under earth's rotation and\nhence the associated phenomena exhibit the spatial isotropy. In the Ives-Stilwell experiment\nand the ammonia maser, it is seen that the speeds ve and vs are invariant under earth's\nrotation and the acceleration ae is zero. Moreover, the terms ue , us , and ve *vs are invariant\nunder earth's rotation, since ve , vs , and Rt all change in a coordinated way with earth's\nrotation. Thus the spatial isotropy can be expected in these experiments and has been\ndemonstrated in the hourly and daily stability of the output frequency from ammonia masers\n[11].\nThe spatial isotropy with respect to earth's motions can be generalized with a step\nforward. As the velocities ve and vs are written in the laboratory frame of velocity v0 , the\nterms vr *v0 , vt *v0 , and v02 emerge in the relevant formulas. It has been indicated that the\ndot-product term vr *v0 or vt *v0 can be common in the Doppler and the quantum effects\nand then cancels out. Consequently, the results of the experiment are independent of the\norientation of the setup with respect to the ground. Thus the experiment possesses a spatial\nisotropy with respect to the setup orientation as well as to earth's motions. This kind of\nspatial isotropy is observed in the three experiments examined so far. Thereby, the output\nfrequency from the ammonia maser is independent of the direction of the molecule velocity\nand hence no observable beat frequency between masers with different orientations can\nbe expected, as demonstrated experimentally in [11]. Moreover, the frequency deviation\nfrom the resonant absorption in the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment can be expected to be\nstable under earth's rotation and be identical for counters with different orientations, as\ndemonstrated experimentally in [14].\n9\n\n\fFurther, the squared term v02 /c2 in some frequency formulas cancels out or is too small\nto detect. As a consequence, the experimental results become independent of the laboratory velocity v0 and hence comply with Galilean relativity, in spite of the restriction on\nthe reference frame of the particle and the propagation velocities. Thus, when the whole\nexperimental setup is put on a vehicle moving smoothly with respect to the ground, the\nmeasurement results can be independent of the ground velocity of the vehicle, as well as\nof the setup orientation and earth's motions. Thereby, the spatial isotropy is generalized\nto the compliance with Galilean relativity. In this way, it is seen that the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor\nexperiment complies with Galilean relativity. Moreover, Galilean relativity can also be observed in the Ives-Stilwell experiment and in the output frequency from the ammonia maser,\nas the minute squared term is difficult to detect. Anyway, these experiments preserve the\nspatial isotropy with respect to the setup orientation and earth's motions.\nHowever, when the measurement precision is improved such that higher-order effects can\nbe detected, some minute terms may emerge to make Galilean relativity or even the spatial\nisotropy break down. The just-mentioned squared term v02 /c2 in the Ives-Stilwell experiment\nand the ammonia maser is an example. For another, we reexamine the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor\nexperiment to a higher order. In order to derive the Doppler effect to the third order of\nnormalized speed, the second-order propagation-range formula (2) is needed, which for the\nM\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment becomes\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1 2\n2\n2\nR(t) = Rt 1 + u0 + 2 [u0 + (vr + v0 + 2vr * v0 ) + ae * Rt ] .\n(28)\nc\n2c\nFor a rotation at a fixed angular velocity, the terms of vr and ae *Rt as well as v0 are\nconstants during rotation. Thus the time rate of change of the propagation range R is given\nby\n\u001a\n\u001b\nd 1\n1\ndR(t)\n(29)\n= Rt\nu0 + 2 [u20 + 2vr * v0 ] .\ndt\ndt c\n2c\nThen, to the third order of normalized speed, the fractional Doppler frequency shift due to\nwave propagation can be given from (16) as\ndR\n1\n1\n\u25b3fD\n=\u2212\n= \u2212 2 vrt * v0 \u2212 3 [(vrt * v0 )u0 \u2212 vr vrt u0 ],\nf0\ncdt\nc\nc\n\n(30)\n\nwhere we have made use of dvr /dt = \u2212R\u0302t vr vrt /Rt and of \u25b3fD /f0 = \u25b3fD /fr to the third\norder. It is seen that \u25b3fD = 0 when v0 = 0.\nBy taking both the Doppler and the quantum effects into account to the third order of\nnormalized speed, the fractional frequency deviation from the resonant absorption is\n1\n1\n\u03b4f\n= 2 (vr2 \u2212 vt2 ) \u2212 3 (vrt * v0 \u2212 vr vrt )u0 .\nf0\n2c\nc\n\n(31)\n\nIt is noted that the dot-product term vrt *v0 survives in the third-order effect, although\nit cancels out in the second-order one. The presence of this term then makes the spatial\nisotropy with respect to the setup orientation and hence Galilean relativity break down,\nalthough it is quite small in magnitude. Accordingly, the frequency deviations tend to be\ndifferent as measured in counters with different orientations with respect to the ground,\nwhen they can be measured to the third order. Thereby, a directional anisotropy in the\nfrequency deviation is predicted. On the other hand, the spatial isotropy with respect to\nearth's rotational and orbital motions is preserved.\n\n5. Conclusion\nBased on the local-ether wave equation for matter wave, the energies of quantum states\nand hence the state transition frequency in an atom decrease with the atom speed by the\nmass-variation factor, where the speed is referred to the associated local-ether frame. Further, for the situation where the source and the receiver atoms move at different velocities,\n10\n\n\fthe local-ether resonant-absorption condition is presented by taking both the Doppler frequency shift for electromagnetic wave and the quantum energy variation of matter wave into\naccount. It is shown that the resonant-absorption condition accounts for the Ives-Stilwell experiment, the output frequency from ammonia masers, and the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment\nin a consistent way.\nBased on the local-ether model, it is evident that the phenomena due both to electromagnetic and matter waves do not at all depend on earth's orbital motion around the Sun\nor others. This immediately accounts for the null effect of earth's orbital motion in various\nearthbound phenomena. Further, for a geostationary experimental setup, the results can be\nindependent of earth's rotation. This accounts for the spatial isotropy found in the stability\nof frequency in the Hughes-Drever experiment and the ammonia maser. The spatial isotropy\nalso holds for the atomic clocks onboard earth's satellites moving in circular orbits and hence\naccounts for the high synchronism among the various GPS atomic clocks. Further, in the\nformula of the Doppler or the quantum effect, it is seen that the major term associated with\nthe laboratory velocity is a dot product between this velocity and that of the emitting or\nabsorbing atom. This term appears both in the Doppler frequency shift and the transition\nfrequency variation and then cancels out. Thus the experimental results become invariant\nwith respect to the setup orientation, as well as to earth's motions. This spatial isotropy\nhas been demonstrated in the ammonia maser where the output frequency is independent\nof the direction of the molecule velocity and in the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment where the\nfrequency deviation from the resonant absorption is independent of the orientation of the\ncounter. Further, the frequency deviation is independent of the laboratory velocity and\nhence the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment complies with Galilean relativity.\nHowever, the aforementioned dot-product term with the laboratory velocity may survive\nin some formulas. Thus the spatial isotropy with respect to the setup orientation and\nhence Galilean relativity break down. This breakdown is in accord with the east-west\ndirectional anisotropy in atomic clock rate demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment.\nBy examining the resonant-absorption condition in the M\u00f6ssbauer rotor experiment to the\nthird order, such a breakdown is also found. Thereby, it is expected that the frequency\ndeviation tends to be different as measured in counters with different orientations. This\npredicted directional anisotropy in the frequency deviation may provide a mean to test the\nlocal-ether model, if the measurement precision can be raised to the third order of normalized\nspeed.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.E.
