This inspires an analogous definition of modular forms\nand Hecke operators in the three dimensional case, i.e., for congruence subgroups of SL(3, Z). For N \u2265 1 an integer, let \u03930 (N ) \u2286 SL(3, Z) be the subgroup\nwhose elements M = (mij ) satisfy:\nm21 \u2261 m31 \u2261 0\n\n(mod N ).\n\nDefinition 1.1 A modular form of level N is an element of H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C).\nDefinition 1.2 For every \u03b1 \u2208 GL(3, Q), let \u0393\u03b1 := \u0393 \u2229 \u03b1\u22121 \u0393\u03b1, where \u0393 :=\n\u03930 (N ). \u0393\u03b1 has finite index both in \u0393 and in \u03b1\u22121 \u0393\u03b1. We have two natural maps\nfrom \u0393\u03b1 to \u0393:\n\u03c6 : \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3,\n\u03c8 : \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u22121 .\n\nConsider the restriction \u03c6\u2217 : H 3 (\u0393, C) \u2192 H 3 (\u0393\u03b1 , C) and the transfer induced\nby \u03c8: \u03c8\u2217 : H 3 (\u0393\u03b1 , C) \u2192 H 3 (\u0393, C).\nWe call Hecke operator the C-linear operator:\nT\u03b1 : H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) \u2192 H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C)\ngiven by the composition \u03c8\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2217 .\nProposition 1.3 Let T (N ) be the subalgebra of End(H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C)) generated\nby the Hecke operators T\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2208 GL(3, Z)+ , (det(\u03b1), N ) = 1. Then T (N ) is\ncommutative and it is generated by the operators T\u03b1p and T\u03b2p with p \u2224 N and:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\np 0 0\np 0 0\n\u03b1p := \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 ; \u03b2p := \uf8ed 0 p 0 \uf8f8 .\n0 0 1\n0 0 1\n2\n\n\fH 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) can be decomposed as direct sum of common eigenspaces for the\noperators in T (N ) :\nM\nH 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) =\nV\u03bb ,\n\u03bb\n\nwith \u03bb homomorphism of algebras T (N ) \u2192 C and T f = \u03bb(T )f , for T \u2208\nT (N ), f \u2208 V\u03bb .\nGiven a character \u03bb of T (N ), we define the eigenvalue ap of the Hecke eigenform\nf \u2208 V\u03bb :\nap := \u03bb(T\u03b1p ).\nThen it is known that: \u03bb(T\u03b2p ) = a \u0304p .\nThe field generated by the eigenvalues ap of a Hecke eigenform f is a number\nfield, either totally real or a CM-field. We will denote this field Qf . The\neigenvalues ap are algebraic integers.\nConjecture 1.4 (Clozel) Let f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) be a cuspidal eigenform for\nthe action of the Hecke algebra T (N ) with eigenvalues: T\u03b1p f = ap f for every\np \u2224 N (and therefore T\u03b2p f = a \u0304p f ) generating the number field Qf .\nThen, if we take for every rational prime l a prime \u03bb in Qf dividing l, there\nexists a compatible family of \u03bb-adic Galois representations\n\u03c1\u03bb : GQ \u2192 GL(3, Qf,\u03bb )\nsuch that for every \u03bb, \u03c1\u03bb is unramified outside lN and for every p \u2224 lN the\ncharacteristic polynomial of \u03c1\u03bb (Frob p) is:\nx3 \u2212 ap x2 + pa \u0304p x \u2212 p3 .\nSee [C], [vG-T1] and [vG-K-T-V]. For the definition of cuspidality see [A-G-G].\nRemark: In [A-M], a similar conjecture for mod p modular forms is stated.\nWe will only consider the case of Qf a CM-field. In the other case the family \u03c1\u03bb becomes selfdual, and there is a finite index subgroup of the image of\nthese representations contained in G \u223c\n= PGL(2, Qf,\u03bb ).\nMost of the known examples of eigenforms f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) have imaginary\nquadratic Qf , such as Qf = Q(i) for f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (128), C).\n\n2\n\nExperimental verification of Clozel's conjecture\n\nA compatible family of three-dimensional \u03bb-adic Galois representations was\nconstructed by van Geemen and Top (see [vG-T1]) to give experimental evidence for the previous conjecture for three eigenforms of different levels, all\nwith Qf = Q(i). These representations are geometric, and we summarize their\nconstruction:\n3\n\n\fLet X be an algebraic variety defined over Q , and consider the Galois l-adic\nrepresentations on tale cohomology:\nn\n\u03c1l : GQ \u2192 GL(Het\n(XQ , Ql )).\n\nIf X is smooth, projective, and with good reduction at p, it is known that the\nrepresentations \u03c1l (l 6= p), are unramified at p and the characteristic polynomial\nof \u03c1l (Frob p) has coefficients in Z, is independent of l and its roots have absolute\nvalue pn/2 .\nClozel's conjecture predicts the determinant of the representations attached to\nmodular forms to be p3 , so we must take n = 2. This also implies |ap | \u2264 3p.\n2\n(SQ , Ql ), where S is a\nThe examples are constructed using a subspace of Het\nsurface. The Galois representation decomposes:\n2\nHet\n(SQ , Ql ) = Tl \u2295 NS(SQ ) \u2297Z Ql ,\n\nwhere NS(SQ ) is the Nron-Severi group and Tl its orthogonal complement with\n2\n2\n4 \u223c\nrespect to the cup product: Het\n\u00d7 Het\n\u2192 Het\n= Ql .\nEigenvalues of Frobenius on NS(SQ ) are roots of unity multiplied by p, so we will\nlook for our family of \u03bb-adic representations inside Tl \u2297Ql Kl with K = Q(i).\nIf it were dim Tl = 3 we would have selfdual representations given by three\ndimensional Ql -vector spaces. We look for three dimensional \u03bb-adic representations \u03c1f,\u03bb associated as in the conjecture to a modular form f with Qf = Q(i).\nTherefore, we want trace(\u03c1f,\u03bb (Frob p)) \u2208 Z[i] and not all these traces in Z.\nThus we suppose that the surface has an automorphism defined over Q:\n\u03c6:S\u2192S\n\nwith \u03c64 = idS .\n\n2\n2\nThe induced map: \u03c6\u2217 : Het\n\u2192 Het\ncommutes with the Galois representations. Suppose that dim Tl = 6 and \u03c6\u2217 : Tl \u2192 Tl has two three dimensional\neigenspaces W\u03bb , W\u03bb\u2032 , with eigenvalues i, \u2212i respectively, such that:\n\nT\u03bb := Tl \u2297Ql Ql (i) = W\u03bb \u2295 W\u03bb\u2032 .\nThis decomposition gives us a compatible family of \u03bb-adic three dimensional\nGalois representations \u03c3\u03bb\u2032 on W\u03bb , a Q(i)\u03bb vector space. In general \u03c3\u03bb\u2032 has to be\ntwisted by a Dirichlet character \u01eb to obtain \u01eb \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb\u2032 = \u03c3\u03bb with det(\u03c3\u03bb (Frob p)) =\np3 .\nThese are the representations we will consider:\n\u03c3S,\u03bb : GQ \u2192 GL(W\u03bb ).\nThe Example: The family of surfaces constructed by van Geemen and Top is\nthe following: Sa is the smooth, minimal projective model of the singular affine\nsurface defined by:\nt2 = xy(x2 \u2212 1)(y 2 \u2212 1)(x2 \u2212 y 2 + axy).\n4\n\n\fThe automorphism \u03c6 is given by (x, y, t) \u2192 (y, \u2212x, t).\nLet N = N (a) be the product of the primes of bad reduction of Sa .\nThe characteristic polynomials of \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb (Frob p) will be denoted\nx3 \u2212 ap x2 + p\u0101p x \u2212 p3 .\nIn particular, we put ap := trace(\u03c3Sa ,\u03bb (Frob p)) \u2208 Q(i) for every p \u2224 lN . These\ntraces are determined using Lefschetz trace formula and counting points of Sa\nover finite fields. Of course these surfaces verify dim Tl = 6.\nWe will illustrate our study of three-dimensional geometric Galois representations with the examples given by the surfaces Sa . This is just to simplify the\nexposition; the results obtained can be applied to any similar example (see section 11).\nIn [vG-K-T-V] the following result is proved:\nTheorem 2.1 Clozel's conjecture (conjecture 1.4) for three examples of modular forms in H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) with N = 128, 160, 205 is experimentally supported by\nthe representations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb described above, with a = 2, 1, 1/16, respectively. More\nprecisely, the eigenvalues of these eigenforms agree with the traces of the images\nof Frobenius for the corresponding representation, for all p \u2224 2N, p \u2264 173.\nRemarks: For example, in the case a = 2, we have to twist by\n\u221a\n\u01eb : GQ \u2192 Gal(Q( \u22122)/Q) \u223c\n= \u00b11,\nto obtain det(\u03c3S2 ,\u03bb ) = \u03c73 , \u03c7 the l-adic cyclotomic character.\nObserve that the properties possessed by a geometric representation that we\nwill use later are preserved by this twist (description of the restriction to the\ninertia subgroup at l and absolute value of roots of characteristic polynomials),\nso no additional difficulties are introduced.\nThe primes of bad reduction of Sa , which are the only primes other than l\nwhere \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb may ramify, are the primes dividing 2a(a2 + 4). This gives only\nthe prime 2 in the case a = 2. It is not known whether the conductor of the\nrepresentations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb is bounded independently of l. If this is the case, we call\nthis minimal uniform bound \"conductor of the family of representations\". The\nexistence of this conductor is conjectured.\n\n3\n\nStatement of purpose\n\nWe will consider the compatible family of Galois representations \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb constructed in the previous section from the surface S2 .\nWe will prove that the image is a special linear group (up to a twist by the\ncyclotomic character) for the primes decomposing in Q(i), i.e., l \u2261 1 (mod 4),\nexcept at most for a set of Dirichlet density 0, and the image of the residual\nGalois representation is a unitary group for the inert primes l \u2261 3 (mod 4),\n5\n\n\fexcept at most for a set of Dirichlet density 0.\nThe exceptional density 0 sets, both for decomposing and inert primes, could\nbe replaced by finite sets if we merely knew the existence and value of the conductor of the family \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb .\nThe method works in general for geometric three-dimensional representations\nover a quadratic imaginary field such as those associated to the surfaces Sa ,\nwhenever certain general conditions that we will describe later are satisfied by\nthe traces of Frobenius (see section 6 and 8) and the action of the inertia subgroup at l (see section 5).\nThe family of representations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb comes from the action of GQ on W\u03bb , the\n2\n3-dimensional i-eigenspace (for \u03c6\u2217 : Tl \u2192 Tl ) contained in Tl \u2286 Het\n(Sa Q , Ql ).\n2\nTl also admits a realization TZ \u2286 H (Sa (C), Z) which is a Hodge structure of\nweight 2, i.e.: TZ is a Z-module, free of rank 6 with\nM\np,q\nTZ \u2297 C =\nT p,q\nT\n= T q,p ,\np+q=2\n\np,q\n\nwith dim T\n= 2 and \u03c6 has eigenvalues i, \u2212i on each T p,q . In particular\nW\u03bb \u2297 C intersects non-trivially each T p,q (cf. [vG-T1]).\n\n4\n\n\u2217\n\nClassification of subgroups of PSL(3, Fq )\n\nWhat follows is the classification, due to Mitchell ([M]), of the maximal subgroups G, up to conjugation, of PSL(3, Fpt ), for t = 1 or 2, as groups of\ncollineations of the projective plane over Fpt . See [V-Y] for the relevant definitions from plane projective geometry. We include the order of the subgroup G\nin each case.\na) the stabilizer of a point: |G| = (pt + 1)p3t (pt \u2212 1)2 / gcd(3, pt \u2212 1)\nb) the stabilizer of a line: |G| = (pt + 1)p3t (pt \u2212 1)2 / gcd(3, pt \u2212 1)\nc) groups that leave invariant a triangle with coordinates in Fpt and make all\nsix permutations of its vertices: |G| = 6(pt \u2212 1)2 / gcd(3, pt \u2212 1)\nd) groups that leave invariant a triangle with coordinates in Fp3t r Fpt and permute its vertices cyclically: |G| = 3(p2t + pt + 1)/ gcd(3, pt \u2212 1)\ne) the stabilizer of a conic: |G| = (pt + 1)pt (pt \u2212 1)\nf) PSL(3, Fpk ) with k \u2264 t :\n|G| = (p2k + pk + 1)(pk + 1)p3k (pk \u2212 1)2 / gcd(3, pk \u2212 1)\ng) (only if t = 2) group of special unitary transformations PSU(3, Fp ): |G| =\n(p2 \u2212 p + 1)(p + 1)2 p3 (p \u2212 1)/ gcd(3, p + 1)\nh) Hessian groups of orders 216 (if pt \u2261 1 (mod 9)), 72 or 36 (if pt \u2261 4, 7\n(mod 9))\ni) group isomorphic to PSL(2, 7) : |G| = 168 (if t = 2 or if t = 1, p \u2261 0, 1, 2, 4\n(mod 7))\nj) group isomorphic to A6 : |G| = 360 (if t = 2 or if t = 1, p \u2261 1, 4 (mod 15)).\n6\n\n\fWe have excluded the case p = 5 and t = 2. In this case there are more\npossibilities.\nRemarks: In cases a) and b) the subgroup is reducible. Cases c) and d) correspond to the normalizer of the group of diagonal matrices and that of the group\nof units of the extension [Fp3t : Fpt ] embedded in SL(3, Fpt ) using the regular\nrepresentation respectively. In particular, inside such a group we have groups\nthat are reducible over Fpt (over Fp3t ), namely, a group of diagonal matrices\nand a cyclic group of units embedded by the regular representation respectively.\nIn case h), the group G fits in the exact sequence\n1 \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 U \u2192 1,\nwith U isomorphic to a subgroup of SL(2, 3) or the quaternionic group D8 and\nF of type (3, 3) (cf. [B]).\nWe will call cases h), i) and j) \"exceptional cases\".\n\n5\n\nComparison of tale and Crystalline cohomologies and the action of inertia\n\nAs a consequence of the result of Fontaine-Messing in [F-M] giving (canonical,\nfunctorial) isomorphism between the tale cohomology and the crystalline cohomology for a variety S having good reduction at l and with dim(S) < l, the\nfollowing theorem, conjectured by Serre in [S2], holds:\nm\nTheorem 5.1 Let V be a GQ -stable lattice in Het\n(SQ , Ql ) and \u1e7c the semisimplification of V /lV with respect to the action of I = Il . Then, if dim(S) < l\nand S have good reduction at l, the action of I is given by a character \u03a8 : It \u2192\nF\u2217q with q = ln , n = dim V , such that\nd +ld1 +...+ln\u22121 dn\u22121\n\n\u03a8 = \u03a8f 0\n\nwith \u03a8f fundamental character of level n and the exponents verify: 0 \u2264 di \u2264 m.\nWe apply this result to the representations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb . For any \u03bb-adic representation\n\u03c3\u03bb , we denote by \u03c3\u0304\u03bb the corresponding residual representation obtained by\ncomposing \u03c3\u03bb with the reduction modulo \u03bb.\nSince det(\u03c3Sa ,\u03bb ) = \u03c73 and m = 2, we have the following possibilities for \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb |I ,\nwhere l > 2 is a prime of good reduction for Sa :\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \u2217 \u2217\n1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c7 \u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8ed 0 \u03c7 \u2217 \uf8f8 ; \uf8ed 0 \u03c822+l\n0 \uf8f8 ; \uf8ed 0 \u03c822\n0 \uf8f8;\n0 0 \u03c72\n0\n0\n\u03c821+2l\n0 0 \u03c822l\n\n7\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n\u03c72\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\n\u2217\n\u03c82\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2217\n0 \uf8f8;\n\u03c82l\n\n\u03c831+2l\n\uf8ed 0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\u03c83l+2l\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n2\n\u03c83l +2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8;\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c7\n\uf8ed0\n0\n\n\u2217\n\u03c7\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2217\n\u2217\uf8f8\n\u03c7\n\nwith \u03c8i a fundamental character of level i.\nWe want to compare this description with the classification of the previous section. To do so, we first need to exclude the last case, the case with trivial\nP((\u03c3\u0304\u03bb |I )ss ).\nIn the examples \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb this can be done because of the Hodge structure of TZ .\nUsing again the fact that our representations are crystalline ([F-M]), we are\nfree to apply the results of Fontaine-Laffaille (cf. [F-L], theorem 5.3), so the\nknowledge of the Hodge filtration allows us to compute the possible values of\nthe exponents of the fundamental characters describing the action of Il as in\ntheorem 5.1. In particular the exponent 1 cannot appear three times because\ndimension T p,q = 2 for (p, q) = (0, 2), (1, 1) and (2, 0).\nIn the other cases we have P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb |I ) of the form:\n\uf8eb \u22121\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u22121\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c7\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u03c7\n\u2217\n\u2217\n1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8ed 0\n1 \u2217\uf8f8; \uf8ed 0\n\u03c82 0 \uf8f8 ; \uf8ed 0 \u03c821\u2212l\n0 \uf8f8;\n0\n0 \u03c7\n0\n0 \u03c82l\n0\n0\n\u03c82l\u22121\n\uf8eb l\u2212l2\n\uf8f6\n\u03c83\n0\n0\n2\n\uf8ed 0\n\u03c83l \u22121\n0 \uf8f8.\n1\u2212l\n0\n0\n\u03c83\n\n6\n6.1\n\nDetermination of the images: totally decomposing primes\nReducible representations\n\nRecall that N denotes the product of the primes of bad reduction of Sa . Suppose that l \u2261 1 (mod 4) is a prime such that \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb is not irreducible over Fl3 .\nIn this case there is a character \u03bc unramified outside N l with image in F\u2217l3 such\nthat \u03bc(p) is a root of x3 \u2212 ap x2 + p\u0101p x \u2212 p3 , for every p \u2224 lN .\nUsing the description of \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb |I we know that \u03bc = \u03c7i \u03b5, with \u03c7 the mod l cyclotomic character, i = 0, 1, 2 and \u03b5 a character unramified outside N .\nThe problem is that we cannot bound the value of cond(\u03b5), the conductor of \u03b5,\nindependently of l. We have to exclude a set of primes of small density in order\nto bound it.\nFor the family of Galois representations \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb of the example, we have N = 2\nand \u03b5 : (Z/2u Z)\u2217 \u2192 F\u2217l3 , with l \u2261 1 (mod 4).\nWe exclude the set P of primes l \u2261 1 (mod 64) in order to bound the conductor of \u03b5.\nWhat follows only holds for l \u2261 1 (mod 4), l \u2208\n/ P.\n8\n\n\fWith this restriction 64 \u2224 l3 \u2212 1 holds, so the image of \u03b5 is a cyclic group of\norder at most 32. Then the conductor of \u03b5 is at most 128.\nThus, \u03b5(p) = 1, for every p \u2261 1 (mod 128). Moreover, \u03b5(p) = 1 for every\np \u2261 \u22121 (mod 128), except if \u03b5 is a character of conductor 4 or 8, in which case\n\u03b5(3) = \u00b11.\nWe will use only a3 and a127 because either \u03b5(127) = 1 or \u03b5(3) = \u00b11. We\nare assuming that \u03bc(p) = pi \u03b5(p), i = 0, 1 or 2, is a root of the characteristic\npolynomials of \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb (Frob p), for every p \u2224 2l. Taking in particular p = 127 or\np = 3, we know that either \u03b5(127) = 1, thus giving the equation:\n1273i \u2212 a127 1272i + 127\u0101127 127i \u2212 1273 \u2261 0\n\n(mod l),\n\ni = 0, 1 or 2, with a127 = 161 \u2212 16i; or \u03b5(3) = \u00b11, giving a similar equation for\np = 3, a3 = 1 + 2i, except for some \u00b1 signs (the values of the traces ap that we\nuse are listed in [vG-K-T-V]).\nFrom these equations we check that \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb may reduce over Fl3 only for the\nprimes l = 5, 13, 1901, 105649. Looking at the characteristic polynomials of\n\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb (Frob p) for these l and several primes p, we see that the representation\n\u03c3\u0304S2 ,5 seems to be reducible (over F5 ). For the other three primes it is irreducible\n(over Fl3 ).\nMoreover, for l = 13 these computations and the classification (section 4) show\nthat the image of P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,13 ) is PSL(3, F13 ). The determination of the image for\na single prime using the classification appears in [A-M] and [A-A-C].\nWe have proved the following:\nTheorem 6.1 For every l \u2261 1 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 1 (mod 64), l 6= 5, the\nGalois representation \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb is irreducible over Fl3 . The same holds for P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb )\nand \u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb .\nThis excludes cases a) and b) of the classification, the case of a diagonal group\ncontained in a maximal subgroup in case c), and the case of a cyclic group contained in a maximal subgroup in case d).\nThe fact that, after excluding a set of primes P, we obtain just a finite number\nof reducible primes, is general. The only condition that a compatible family\nof geometric Galois representations (such as those we obtain from the surfaces\nSa , a \u2208 Q) has to verify for this to hold is the following:\nCondition 1. If c is (a uniform bound for) the conductor of the family \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb ,\nthen there exists a prime p \u2261 1 (mod c) such that ap \u2208\n/ R.\nIf we do not know c (or even that it exists) we exclude a set of primes P such\nthat for every prime l decomposing totally in K := Q({ap }) = Q(i) and l \u2208\n/P\nthe conductor of \u03b5 (a character ramifying only at the primes of bad reduction of\nSa with values in F\u2217l3 ) is uniformly bounded by d. This is exactly what we have\ndone in the example given by the surface S2 to obtain the \"artificial bound\" 128\n9\n\n\ffor the conductor. Then we require:\nCondition 1'. There exists a prime p \u2261 1\n\n(mod d) with ap \u2208\n/ R.\n\nUnder condition 1 or 1', we prove that there is a finite number of reducible\nprimes, outside P and decomposing totally in K, as follows:\nTake p \u2261 1 (mod d) (or p \u2261 1 (mod c)) with ap \u2208\n/ R.\nThen \u03b5(p) = 1 and putting \u03bc = \u03b5\u03c7i , i = 0, 1, 2 we obtain:\np3 \u2212 1 \u2261 p\u0101p \u2212 ap\n\np3 \u2212 1 \u2261 pap \u2212 \u0101p\nap \u2212 \u0101p \u2261 0\n\n(mod l)\n\n(i = 0),\n\n(mod l)\n\n(i = 2),\n\n(mod l)\n\n(i = 1).\n\nFor the finiteness of the set of solutions of the third, use condition 1 or 1'.\nFor the other two congruences, use |ap | \u2264 3p.\n\n6.2\n\nCases c) and d) of the classification\n\nWe will now study the non-cyclic case of d) and case c) of the classification (see\nsection 4).\nd) Let G\u03bb := Image(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb ). If its projective image P(G\u03bb ) is an irreducible\ngroup contained in a maximal subgroup in case d), then P(G\u03bb ) is contained in\nthe normalizer of a cyclic group, and it fits in the exact sequence\n1 \u2192 C \u2192 P(G\u03bb ) \u2192 C3 \u2192 1,\nwhere C is cyclic of order |C| | p2 + p + 1.\nc) If P(G\u03bb ) is an irreducible subgroup contained in a maximal group in case\nc), then P(G\u03bb ) is contained in the normalizer of a diagonal group, and it fits in\nthe exact sequence\n1 \u2192 R \u2192 P(G\u03bb ) \u2192 U \u2192 1,\nwhere U is isomorphic to a subgroup of S3 and R is diagonal of order |R| |\n(p \u2212 1)2 .\n\u2022 Case d): Using the description of the image of the inertia subgroup at l\n(see section 5), we know that its projective image will be contained in C, because\nit is cyclic with order greater or equal to l \u2212 1 > 3, whenever l \u2265 5.\nThen composing P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb ) with the quotient P(G\u03bb ) \u2192 C3 we obtain a representation\nGQ \u0589 C3\n\n10\n\n\funramified outside N , because when we take quotient by C we are trivializing\nthe image of the inertia group at l.\nSo its kernel gives a cubic character \u03c8 unramified outside N , and if p \u2224 lN :\n\u03c8(p) 6= 1 \u21d2 trace(P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb )(Frob p)) = 0 \u21d4 ap \u2261 0\n\n(mod l). (6.1)\n\nHere we are using the fact that a matrix obtained by a non trivial cyclic permutation of the columns of a diagonal matrix has trace 0. To control this case\nwe need the following\nDefinition 6.2 let N \u2032 be the product of primes of bad reduction of Sa except\nthat we put 9 in this product if 3 is a prime of bad reduction. Then we say that\nthe family of representations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb has cubic Complex Multiplication (or cubic\nCM) if there exists a character:\n\u03c8 : (Z/N \u2032 Z)\u2217 \u2192 C3\nsuch that for every p \u2224 N \u2032 with \u03c8(p) 6= 1, ap = 0, i.e,\nap = \u03c8(p)ap\n\nfor every\n\np \u2224 N \u2032.\n\nThen, it is clear that only finitely many primes l can fall in case d) if we avoid\ncubic CM.\nIn the example \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb , N = 2 and 3 \u2224 (Z/2k Z)\u2217 , so that case d) cannot happen\nfor any l.\n\u2022 Case c): Again we have P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb |I ) contained in the center R, because\nl \u2212 1 > 3 for l \u2265 5 and S3 does not contain cyclic subgroups of order greater\nthan 3. Assuming irreducibility of the representation, we must have U = S3 or\nC3 . If U = C3 , the same analysis as in case d) applies.\nIf U = S3 , consider the quotient S3 \u0589 C2 . Composing the epimorphisms\nGQ \u0589 P(G\u03bb ) \u0589 S3 \u0589 C2\nwe obtain a quadratic character \u03b3 unramified outside N . We have that for every\np \u2224 lN , \u03b3(p) = \u22121 implies that P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb )(Frob p) becomes diagonal after an odd\npermutation of its columns.\nThese matrices have the following property: If their characteristic polynomial\nis x3 + Ax2 + Bx + C, then AB = C.\nBut the characteristic polynomial of \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb (Frob p) is, for every p \u2224 N l:\nx3 \u2212 ap x2 + p\u0101p x \u2212 p3\nThen \u03b3(p) = \u22121 \u21d2 \u2212pap \u0101p \u2261 \u2212p3\nap \u0101p \u2261 p2\n\n(mod l).\n\n(mod l) must hold, and therefore:\n(mod l).\n\n11\n\n(6.2)\n\n\fDefinition 6.3 We say that the family of representations \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb is dual with\nrespect to a quadratic character \u03b3 (ramifying only at the primes of bad reduction\nof Sa ) if, for every prime p,\n\u03b3(p) = \u22121 \u21d2 ap \u0101p = p2 .\nAgain, it is clear that, assuming that \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb is not dual with respect to any\nquadratic character, it follows that only finitely many primes l can fall in case\nc).\nRemark: The consideration of the quotient C2 of S3 is just to simplify computations. Note that the condition obtained is sufficient to guarantee that only\nfinitely many primes fall in case c), but not necessary. The alternative option\nis to work with S3 , and we obtain a situation analogous to that encountered in\ncase d). The difference is that now we have to work with the closure L of a noncyclic cubic extension of Q, instead of with a cyclic cubic field. L only ramifies\nat primes of bad reduction of Sa (only finitely many possible L thanks to Hermite's theorem). For every p \u2224 lN we should look at the element in Gal(L/Q)\ncorresponding to Frob p : if it is a non trivial cyclic permutation then formula\n(6.1) applies, and (6.2) if is is an odd permutation. Therefore, for case c) to\nhold for infinitely many primes the representations should be dual respect to a\nquadratic character and the coefficients ap should be 0 for \"one third\" of the\nprimes.\nIn the example \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb , \u03b3 would ramify only at 2. Then \u03b3(3) = \u22121 or \u03b3(5) = \u22121.\nUsing only a3 = 1 + 2i and a5 = \u22121 \u2212 4i we conclude that the representation is\nnot dual respect to \u03b3. Moreover:\na3 \u01013 = 5 \u2261 32 (mod l) \u21d2 l = 2,\na5 \u01015 = 17 \u2261 52 (mod l) \u21d2 l = 2.\nSo that no prime l \u2261 1 (mod 4), l > 5, falls in case c) .\n\n6.3\n\nCase e) : The stabilizer of a conic\n\nChoosing an adequate basis we can write the equation of a general conic as:\ny 2 = kxz.\nThen, it is easy to see that the stabilizer of this conic is the group of matrices\nof the form (cf. [V-Y]):\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2\nk\u03b12\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\u03b1\u03b2\n\u221a\u03b2\n\uf8ed k k\u03b1\u03b2\nk(\u03b1\u03b4 + \u03b2\u03b3)\nk\u03b2\u03b4 \uf8f8 .\n2\nk\u03b3\n2\u03b3\u03b4\n\u03b42\nOne can check by direct computation that the characteristic polynomial is for\nsuch matrices:\nx3 \u2212 Ax2 + Bx \u2212 C,\n12\n\n\fwith B 3 = CA3 .\nTherefore, if we suppose that the image of \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb falls in case e) we must have:\np3 \u01013p \u2261 p3 a3p (mod \u03bb) for every p \u2224 lN , or equivalently:\na3p \u2261 \u01013p\n\n(mod \u03bb).\n\nThe values ap are all in a quadratic imaginary\n\u221afield K. Then, for a prime p such\nthat ap 6\u2208 R, a3p 6= \u01013p ; provided that K 6= Q( \u22123).\nThus, for the representations \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb case e) can only happen for finitely many\nprimes.\nMore generally, this will be the case whenever the representations are nonselfdual in the more general sense that there does not exist any character \u03bd such\nthat ap = \u03bd(p)\u0101p for every p \u2224 lN .\nIn the example, using only a3 we obtain: (1 + 2i)3 \u2261 (1 \u2212 2i)3 (mod \u03bb), and\nthis implies l = 2. We conclude that no prime l \u2261 1 (mod 4) falls in case e)\nin our example.\n\n6.4\n\nThe exceptional cases\n\nIn these cases P(G\u03bb ) \u2286 PSL(3, Fl ) is a group contained in another group of order\n36, 72, 168, 216 or 360. The description of P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb |I ) given in section 5 tells us\nthat in the image of P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb ) there is a cyclic subgroup of order l \u2212 1, l + 1 or\nl2 + l + 1. This gives only a few possibilities for the exceptional primes. Using\nthe structure of the exceptional groups in cases h), i) and j) and the restriction\nto l \u2261 1 (mod 4) we end up with l = 5 or 13.\nAs we already mentioned, we know that P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,13 ) has image PSL(3, F13 ). Then,\n5 is the only prime l \u2261 1 (mod 4) not in P such that the image of P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb ) for\n\u03bb | l can be a proper subgroup of PSL(3, Fl ).\n\n6.5\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have considered all cases in the classification of subgroups of PSL(3, Fl )\ngiven in section 4. Therefore, we conclude:\nTheorem 6.4 The family of representations \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb verifies:\nImage(P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb )) = PSL(3, Fl ),\nfor every prime l \u2261 1 (mod 4),\n\nl 6\u2261 1\n\n(mod 64),\n\nl > 5.\n\nRemark: The groups PSL(3, Fl ), for all primes l \u2261 1 (mod 4), have been\npreviously realized as Galois groups over Q(t) using rigidity methods in [Th].\nObserve that the image of \u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb is contained in SL(3, Fl ) and\nP(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb ) = P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb ).\nThen we conclude that:\n13\n\n\fCorollary 6.5\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb ) = SL(3, Fl ),\nfor every l \u2261 1 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 1 (mod 64), l > 5. In particular, for these\nvalues of l the groups SL(3, Fl ) are Galois groups over Q. For each l, the\ncorresponding number field is unramified outside 2l.\nRemark: Using a lemma of Serre (see [S1]), we also conclude that for these l\nthe image of \u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb is SL(3, Zl ).\n\n7\n\nOn the density of the exceptional set - Condition 1' revisited\n\nWe have proved that the image of \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb is \"as large as possible\" for infinitely\nmany totally decomposed primes. Now we will show that this, together with\nthe Cebotarev density theorem, forces the image of the rest of the totally decomposed primes to be also \"as large as possible\", except at most for a set of\nDirichlet density 0.\nLemma 7.1 If a compatible family of three-dimensional geometric Galois representations \u03c3\u03bb verifies\nImage(\u03c3\u0304\u03bb ) = PSL(3, Fl )\nfor an infinite set L of totally decomposed primes, then condition 1' is satisfied\nfor any d.\nBefore proving this lemma, let us show its consequences. We denote by D the\nset of totally decomposed primes in Q({ap }). Suppose that for a compatible\nfamily of geometric Galois representations we have checked all conditions, as in\nthe previous section, to ensure an image \"as large as possible\" for those primes\nin D that are not in a finite exceptional set S nor in a certain excluded set P as\nin condition 1', and assume that the Dirichlet density of P is smaller than that\nof D. Then we apply lemma 7.1 and conclude that condition 1' is still valid for\nan arbitrarily large d and the corresponding set P \u2032 of arbitrarily small Dirichlet\ndensity to be excluded. Therefore, the image must be \"as large as possible\"\nfor every prime in D except for the elements of P \u2032 and a finite set S \u2032 . Note\nthat S \u2032 may be larger than S, but it is still finite (condition 1' implies that\nthere are only finitely many primes with reducible image in D r P \u2032 ). Letting\nthe conductor d go to infinity we conclude that the exceptional set has Dirichlet\ndensity 0.\nApplying this to the representations \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb we obtain:\nTheorem 7.2\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb ) = SL(3, Fl )\nfor every l \u2261 1\n\n(mod 4), except at most for a set of Dirichlet density 0.\n\n14\n\n\fProof of lemma 7.1.\nThe proof is based on the fact that, whenever ap is real, the characteristic\npolynomial of \u03c3\u03bb (Frob p) decomposes over Q:\nx3 \u2212 ap x2 + pap x \u2212 p3 = (x \u2212 p)(x2 + (p \u2212 ap )x + p2 ).\nSuppose that this happens for every p \u2261 1 (mod d) for some d. Now consider\nthe residual representation \u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb for a prime l \u2208 L. For such a prime\nthe image is SL(3, Fl ). Let Ul be the image of the subgroup of Gal(Q\u0304/Q)\ntopologically generated by the Frobenius elements at primes p \u2261 1 (mod d); it\nis a subgroup of SL(3, Fl ) and it follows from the Cebotarev density theorem that\nit is made of (not only generated by) matrices whose characteristic polynomials\nare reducible over Fl . Therefore, it is clear that\n|Ul |/|SL(3, Fl )| \u2264 1/(l2 + l + 1).\nOn the other hand, by the Cebotarev density theorem and the fact that the\nDirichlet density of the set of p \u2261 1 (mod d) is 1/\u03c6(d) (where \u03c6 is the Euler\nfunction), we must have:\n|Ul |/|SL(3, Fl )| \u2265 1/\u03c6(d).\nTherefore l2 + l + 1 \u2264 \u03c6(d). But l can be taken to be arbitrarily large, because\nL is infinite, so we obtain a contradiction, and this proves the lemma.\n\n8\n8.1\n\nDetermination of the images: inert primes\nImitation of section 6\n\nWith slight changes, the same ideas used for totally decomposed primes can\nalso be applied to deal with the same cases of the classification for inert primes.\nIn our example these are the primes l \u2261 3 (mod 4) and for them the image of\nthe representation \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb is a subgroup of PSL(3, Fl2 ). We briefly describe this\nprocedure:\n\u2022 Reducible representations: We have a character \u03bc = \u03c7i \u03b5 with \u03bc(p) a root\nof the characteristic polynomial of \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb (Frob p), i = 0, 1, 2 and \u03b5 unramified\noutside 2, as in section 6.1. The difference is that the image of \u03b5 is now contained in F\u2217l6 . To bound the conductor we subtract from the set of inert primes\nthe set P of primes l \u2261 \u22121 (mod 32). We obtain 64 \u2224 l6 \u2212 1, and the same\nbound for the conductor as in section 6.1. So with the computations of that\nsection, using \u03b5(127) = 1 or \u03b5(3) = \u00b11, and the characteristic polynomials corresponding to these two primes, we prove that the image is irreducible (over\nFl6 ) for every l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 \u22121 (mod 32), except of course for l = 3\nand 127. To save the prime 127 we compute the reduction mod 127 of a few\ncharacteristic polynomials and this shows that the image of the corresponding\n15\n\n\frepresentation is irreducible over F1272 and is not cyclic. We ignore the prime\n3 because our method fails for it in cases c) and d), and by direct inspection\nwe cannot determine whether it falls in the exceptional cases or not; so we will\nassume henceforth that we are dealing only with primes greater than 3.\nWe have proved that for every l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 \u22121 (mod 32), l > 3,\ncases a) , b) and the reducible subcases of c) and d) in the classification are not\npossible for the image of the corresponding residual Galois representation.\n\u2022 Cases c), d) and e): All we have done in sections 6.2 and 6.3 applies as\nwell to the inert primes greater than 3 (this inequality being essential in the\nargument used in cases c) and d)). We conclude that, under the hypothesis of\nirreducibility, no inert prime greater than 3 falls in these cases (recall that in\nthe computations we have only used a3 and a5 ).\n\u2022 Exceptional cases: As in section 6.4, we have a cyclic subgroup of the image with order l \u2212 1, l + 1 or l2 + l + 1. Using the structure of the exceptional\ngroups, we see that they have a cyclic subgroup of one of these orders only for\nl = 7, 11 and 19, among all primes l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l > 3. Computing the\nreduction of some characteristic polynomials modulo these three primes, we see\nthat there are elements in the image of the corresponding representation whose\norders do not divide the order of those exceptional groups we were suspecting\nthe image could be equal to. We conclude that no inert prime greater than 3\nfalls in the exceptional cases.\nNow we consider the remaining cases in the classification (see section 4):\nCase f) with k = 1: If, for an inert prime l, the image were contained in\nPSL(3, Fl ), there should exist for every prime p \u2224 2l an element c(p) \u2208 F\u0304\u2217l such\nthat c(p)3 p3 \u2208 F\u2217l and c(p)ap \u2208 Fl . Therefore, a3p \u2208 Fl . This implies that the\nprime l falls in case e), the stabilizer of a conic.\nIn his article [M], Mitchell also classifies the subgroups of PSU(3, Fl ). All of\nthem are subgroups of those appearing in section 4, so we can conclude from\nthe computations above that no proper subgroup of PSU(3, Fl ) will be obtained\nas the image of \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb for any inert prime l not in the excluded set.\nApplying the classification in section 4, for t = 2, we obtain:\nTheorem 8.1 The family of representations \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb verifies:\nImage(P(\u03c3\u0304\u03bb )) = PSU(3, Fl ) or PSL(3, Fl2 )\nfor every prime l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 \u22121 (mod 32), l > 3.\nApplying lemma 7.1, and letting the bound of the conductor of the character in\nthe reducible case tend to infinity, we conclude, as in section 7, that the density\nof the set of inert primes with reducible image (over Fl6 ) is 0. For those with\nirreducible image, the previous theorem applies:\n16\n\n\fCorollary 8.2 The conclusion of theorem 8.1 is valid for every l \u2261 3\nexcept at most for a set of Dirichlet density 0.\n\n8.2\n\n(mod 4),\n\nUnitariness\n\nIn this section we will prove that for those inert primes such that theorem 8.1\nor corollary 8.2 applies, the image is in fact unitary. Our reasoning will be by\nreductio ad absurdum.\nLemma 8.3 For the family of representation \u03c3Sa ,\u03bb , the image of P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb ) can\nnot be PSL(3, Fl2 ) for any prime l \u2261 3 (mod 4).\nThis lemma, together with theorem 8.1 and corollary 8.2 gives:\nTheorem 8.4 The family of representations \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb verifies:\nImage(P(\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb )) = PSU(3, Fl )\nfor every prime l \u2261 3 (mod 4), except at most for a set of Dirichlet density\n0, in particular the result is valid for every prime l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 \u22121\n(mod 32), l > 3.\nProof of lemma 8.3.\nSuppose that there is a prime l \u2261 3 (mod 4) such that the image of P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb ) is\nPSL(3, Fl2 ). In particular, there will be elements in this image of order l4 +l2 +1\n(projective classes of generators of the cyclic group of units of Fl6 embedded in\nSL3 via the regular representation). By the Cebotarev density theorem there\nwill be infinitely many primes p such that P(\u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb )(Frob p) is an element of\nthis order. In this case, the characteristic polynomial of \u03c3\u0304Sa ,\u03bb (Frob p) will be\nirreducible modulo l and its roots will be elements of Fl6 of order multiple of\nl4 + l2 + 1. Therefore the polynomial:\nx3 \u2212 ap x2 + p\u0101p x \u2212 p3\n\n(8.1)\n\nis irreducible in characteristics 0 and l, with ap \u2208 Q(i) r Q and its reduction in\nFl2 r Fl .\nLet \u03b1 be one of its roots, it is an algebraic integer with [Q(\u03b1) : Q] = 6 and l is\ninert in Q(\u03b1)/Q. Let L be the prime in Q(\u03b1) dividing l and let us denote by \u02c6\nreduction mod L. Then [Fl (\u03b1\u0302) : Fl ] = 6.\nBy reducing mod L, we can see that\n\u03b1l\n\n3\n\n+1\n\n\u2261 p2\n\n(mod l).\n\nSo the order of \u03b1 divides (l3 + 1)(l \u2212 1) = (l2 \u2212 l + 1)(l + 1)(l \u2212 1).\nBut \u03b1 is a root of the characteristic polynomial (8.1) and, by assumption, its\norder is a multiple of l4 + l2 + 1 = (l2 + l + 1)(l2 \u2212 l + 1). This is a contradiction. This proves that for every prime inert in [Q(i) : Q], the image of the\ncorresponding Galois representation cannot be PSL(3, Fl2 ).\n17\n\n\fRemark: The fact that the images of the Galois representations for inert primes,\nwhen irreducible, are unitary, can be proved directly using the particular form\nof the characteristic polynomials, which in turn is a consequence of the Riemann\nhypothesis (see [A-M]).\nCorollary 8.5\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3S2 ,\u03bb ) = SU(3, Fl ),\nfor every l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l 6\u2261 \u22121 (mod 32), l > 3. In particular, for\nthese values of l the groups SU(3, Fl ) are Galois groups over Q. For each l, the\ncorresponding number field is unramified outside 2l.\nRemark: The groups SU(3, Fl ) for all primes l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l > 3, have been\nrealized as Galois groups over Q using rigidity methods in [Ma].\n\n9\n\nFinal comments on the example\n\nBy Deligne's corollary to the results of de Jong (cf. [Be], Proposition 6.3.2),\nwe know that in our example an uniform bound for the conductor exists. As a\nconsequence of the results in section 7, condition 1 (see section 6) is satisfied.\nTherefore the image is as large as possible for almost every prime, i.e., theorem\n7.2 and corollary 8.5 hold for almost every prime.\nFor the prime l = 5 we have computed the reduction of the characteristic\npolynomials of \u03c3S2 ,5 (Frob p) modulo 5 for 2 < p \u2264 97, p 6= 5, and we have\nfound the trivial character 1 as a root of them; so we suspect that the residual\nrepresentation for 5 is reducible with \u03b5 = 1 and \"i=0\". If this were so, after\nsemi-simplification we also obtain a two-dimensional subrepresentation \u03c0 over\nF5 , unramified outside 2 * 5, with determinant \u03c73 (\u03c7 the mod 5 cyclotomic\ncharacter). The semi-simplification of the restriction of \u03c0 to the inertia group\nat 5 (see section 5) is the sum of the characters \u03c7 and \u03c72 or \u03c822+5 and \u03c821+2*5 . The\ncomputations also show that \u03c0 is irreducible. If ap is the trace of \u03c3\u0304S2 ,5 (Frob p)\nand bp that of \u03c0(Frob p) then we have:\nap \u2261 1 + b p\n\n(mod 5),\n\n(10.1)\n\nfor every p \u2224 10. Applying Serre's conjecture (see [S3]) to \u03c0 we deduce that there\nshould exist a classical modular form f of level a power of 2 and weight 8 whose\nFourier coefficients reduced modulo 5 agree with the bp . Looking at the space\nof newforms S8 (128) we have found a newform verifying this for every p \u2264 97,\nthus providing more evidence for the fact that \u03c3\u0304S2 ,5 is reducible. Observe that\nthe congruence (10.1) relates the coefficients of f , an eigenform in S8 (128), with\nthose of an eigenform in H 3 (\u03930 (128), C).\n18\n\n\fThe values ap are computed in [vG-T1] in terms of the number of points of S2\nand other related surfaces over finite fields. The reducibility at 5 would imply\ncongruences modulo 5 involving these numbers of points, depending only on the\nvalue modulo 40 of the characteristic p of the finite field.\nFor an inert prime l greater than 3 such that the image of \u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb is not as in\ntheorem 8.4, if any, this representation must be reducible and with \"i=1\". After\nsemi-simplification we would obtain a two dimensional subrepresentation \u03c0 over\nFl2 . It can be proved that Image(P(\u03c0)) must be conjugated in PGL(2, Fl4 ) to\nPSL(2, Fl ). In this case, after conjugation and twisting by an appropriate character, the image of \u03c0 would be SL(2, Fl ). To see this we apply the classification\nof subgroups of PSL(2, Flr ) as in [R1] and [R2] and the techniques of this article;\nunitariness and the Cebotarev density theorem to prove that the reducibility\nassumption implies that the three roots of the characteristic polynomials of\n\u03c3\u0304S2 ,\u03bb (Frob p) must be in Fl2 , the techniques of sections 6 and 8 to eliminate\nthe dihedral and special cases for the image of P(\u03c0) and the description of the\nrestriction to inertia at l to eliminate the possibility that \u03c0 were reducible.\n\n10\n\nOn the generality of the previous results\n\nWe stress that conclusions such as those of sections 6, 7 and 8 asserting that\nthe images are generically \"as large as possible\" will still be valid if we perform\nthe computations starting from any other similar geometric three-dimensional\ncompatible family of Galois representations defined over an imaginary quadratic\nfield K (for example, those obtained from the surfaces Sa for any a \u2208 Z\u2212{0}) as\nlong as the Hodge structure is as in the example, condition 1' is verified with an\n\"excluded set\" of primes of relatively small density, the family of\u221arepresentations\nis non-selfdual in the general sense (this is automatic if K 6= Q( \u22123 )) and does\nnot have cubic CM, nor is dual with respect to any character.\nIn particular, Jasper Scholten has communicated to us that with the techniques\nof [Sc] using elliptic surfaces he can produce examples of non-selfdual compat\u221a\nible families of three-dimensional Galois representations defined over Q( \u22123).\nUnfortunately, these examples have not been published and are unavailable. If\nany of these examples verifies all of the above conditions, then as a consequence\nwe would realize the groups SL(3, Fl ) as Galois groups over Q for every l \u2261 \u00b11\n(mod 12), except for a subset of primes of Dirichlet density 0, and the groups\nSU(3, Fl ) for every l 6\u2261 \u00b11 (mod 12) except for a subset of Dirichlet density\n0.\nThe only point where the argument seems to depend on the fact that K = Q(i)\nis section 8.2, but it is straightforward to verify that it applies to any imaginary\n3\nquadratic field. The only step that needs a closer look is the congruence \u00eel = \u2212\u00ee\n(in fact an equality even in characteristic 0), a crucial point because it shows\nthat complex conjugation agrees with the\u221aFrobenius automorphism. In the\n3\ngeneral case it becomes \u03be\u0302 l = \u2212\u03be\u02c6 with \u03be = \u2212D and l inert in K = Q(\u03be). This\nl\u22121\ncongruence follows from (\u2212D) 2 \u2261 \u22121 (mod l).\n19\n\n\f11\n11.1\n\nStrong Form of Clozel's conjecture and applications\nThe Conjecture\n\nIn this section we will assume the validity of a strong form of Clozel's conjecture\nand we will derive consequences for inverse Galois theory. We will give intrinsic conditions on a Hecke eigenform (whose eigenvalues generate an imaginary\nquadratic field) guaranteeing that the results summarized in the previous section\napply to the attached Galois representations, so for those eigenforms verifying\nthese conditions the images of the residual representations will be \"as large as\npossible\" for almost every prime: SL3 or SU3 (after twisting by \u03c7) depending\non the decomposition type of the prime.\nConjecture 11.1 Let f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C) be a cuspidal Hecke eigenform, then\nthere is a compatible family of Galois representations attached to f as described\nin conjecture 1.4. These representations \u03c1\u03bb arise from the action of GQ on a\nrank 3 motive defined over Q with coefficients in Qf . For every l \u2224 N the (semisimplification of the) restriction of \u03c1\u0304\u03bb to the inertia group at l is not the group\nof scalar matrices \u03c7 * Id. Moreover, for every l, the conductor of \u03c1\u0304\u03bb divides the\nlevel N .\nRemark: The resulting motive has weight 2.\nJustification: The geometric or motivic nature of the conjectured Galois representations appears already in [C] (see also [Ra]). The relation between the\nweight of the modular form and the image of inertia is taken from the generalizations of Serre's conjectures by Ash and Sinnott (see [A-Si]).\nFinally, the relation between the level and the conductor comes from the analogy with the case of classical modular forms. Recently, this relation has been\npostulated as part of the generalized Serre's conjecture for the case of arbitrary\nlevel (see [A-D-P]). Removing this last hypothesis would complicate the computations as in the purely geometric example we considered above, and the results\non the largeness of the images would hold only outside a density 0 set of primes.\nAssuming conjecture 11.1, we can apply the techniques of the previous sections\nto modular families of Galois representation. The desired result will follow as\nlong as the modular form f verify certain conditions.\n\n11.2\n\nConditions on the Modular Forms\n\nAs usual, we consider only the case of Hecke eigenforms\nf \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (N ), C)\nwith Qf imaginary quadratic. If f is cuspidal, the needed facts, i.e., that the\nroots of the characteristic polynomial of the image of Frob p should have absolute value p (Ramanujan's conjecture) and the bound on the eigenvalue ap\n20\n\n\fthat this implies, are known (using the fact that f is a cuspidal automorphic\nforms on GL(3)). They agree with the geometric hypothesis in conjecture 11.1\n(Riemann hypothesis).\nThe statement about the image of inertia at l in conjecture 11.1 can be replaced\nby a condition on the Hodge decomposition of the motive, as explained in section 5.\nTherefore, in order to apply the techniques of previous sections to these\nrepresentations and obtain large images, we only need to determine which conditions on f correspond to the fact that the family of Galois representations\nbecome:\n1) selfdual (in general sense),\n2) reducible, or\n3) monomial.\nExplanation:\n2) If the representations \u03c1\u0304\u03bb were reducible for infinitely many \u03bb, then thanks\nto Ramanujan's conjecture we can assume (see sections 6 and 8) that one of\nthe irreducible components is of the form \u03b5\u03bb \u03c7, where \u03b5\u03bb is a character with\nconductor dividing N . Moreover, using the fact that the determinant \u03c73 of \u03c1\u0304\u03bb\nis unramified at N , we conclude that it must hold: cond(\u03b5\u03bb )2 | N .\nLet us show that in this situation the representations are reducible also in characteristic 0, independently of l. To see this, observe that from the uniform\nbound on the conductors of the characters \u03b5\u03bb , we know that there is a complex\ncharacter \u03b5 with the square of its conductor dividing N such that \u03b5(p)p is a root\nof \u03c1\u03bb (Frob p), for every p \u2224 N , l \u2224 N .\nFrom this and the reducibility of infinitely many residual representations, an\napplication of the theory of pseudo-representations (see [T]) proves that the\nvalues {ap \u2212 \u03b5(p)p} correspond to the traces of a two-dimensional compatible\nfamily of Galois representations {\u03bd\u03bb\u2032 }.\nFor an exposition of the standard facts of the theory of pseudo- representations and how to use them to prove reducibility, see [D1], chapter 6 (or [D2]).\nThe only difference is that because we are not dealing with odd residual representations the construction of the representations \u03bd\u03bb\u2032 is done using Taylor's\nnotion of pseudo-representation instead of Wiles' one. Therefore, for every \u03bb\nthere is a \u03bb\u2032 -adic Galois representation \u03bd\u03bb\u2032 over Q\u03bb\u2032 (\u03bb\u2032 a prime above \u03bb) with\ntrace(\u03bd\u03bb\u2032 (Frob p)) = ap \u2212 \u03b5(p)p, for every p \u2224 lN .\nWe conclude that if the representations \u03c1\u0304\u03bb are reducible for infinitely many \u03bb,\nthen they are so for every prime \u03bb. Furthermore, after a field extension we\nobtain a reducible family of \u03bb\u2032 -adic representations:\n\u03c1ss\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u03b5 * \u03c7 \u2295 \u03bd\u03bb\u2032 .\nThe converse is obvious. In what follows, condition 2) refers to either of these\ntwo equivalent conditions.\n21\n\n\f3) As explained in section 6.2, dual respect to a character was a weaker notion\nintroduced to simplify computations, but if the images of the Galois representations fall in case c) or d) (see section 4) for infinitely many primes, the\nrepresentations are monomial for every \u03bb \u2224 N . In these cases the representations are induced from a character of a cyclic, respectively (Galois closure of a)\nnon-cyclic, cubic extension of Q.\n1) \"In general sense\" means up to multiplication by a character. Recall that\nthis is incompatible with\u221athe assumption that Qf is imaginary quadratic, except\nfor the case of Qf = Q( \u22123).\nNow let us translate these three conditions to conditions on the Hecke eigenform f , using the language of automorphic forms. This can be done because\nour space of modular forms can be thought of as being included in that of automorphic forms on GL(3)/Q, and the cuspidal modular forms correspond to\ncuspidal automorphic forms (see [A-G-G]).\nCondition 1) implies that the automorphic form is selfdual:\nf \u2297 \u03c9 = f \u2228,\n\n(I)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a Hecke character, i.e., a one dimensional automorphic representation\nof GL(1)/Q. This is the case in particular when f is the symmetric square constructed by Gelbart and Jacquet of an automorphic representation on GL(2)/Q.\nCondition 2) implies that the Galois representations attached to f (assuming\nthey are semisimple) reduce as the sum of the Galois representations associated\nto a Hecke character and those associated to a certain rank two motive. In this\nsituation, we can apply a result ([Ra], prop. 3.2.4) guaranteeing that the property of a motive of being associated to an automorphic form is \"closed under\nsubtraction\" (this generalizes theorem 4.7 in [J-S]), so we have:\nf = \u03c9 \u229e g,\n\n(II)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a Hecke character and g an automorphic form on GL(2)/Q. In this\ncase f cannot be cuspidal (see [J-S]).\nRemark: The result we are applying is only proved (see [Ra]) under the assumption of the analytic Tate conjecture.\nCondition 3) in our case of cubic induction is also a case of Langlands' functoriality solved, i.e., given E (the Galois closure of) a cubic extension of Q and a\nHecke character \u03c6 on GL(1)/E there is an automorphic form on GL(3)/Q with\nthe same L-function:\nf = IndQ\n(III)\nE (\u03c6).\nThese are the automorphic representations corresponding to condition 3).\nTheorem 11.2 Assume conjecture 11.1 and the analytic Tate conjecture (cf.\n[Ra]). If a cuspidal Hecke eigenform f with Qf imaginary quadratic does not\nverify either condition (I) or (III) above, then the images of the residual representations \u03c1\u0304\u03bb attached\n\u221a to f are \"as large as possible\" for almost every l.\nMoreover, if Qf 6= Q( \u22123) then f does not verify condition (I).\n22\n\n\f11.3\n\nExamples\n\nFirst we apply these ideas to the eigenform f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (128), C) appearing in\ntheorem 2.1. As stated there, all coefficients used in the computations agree with\nthe traces of the family of geometric Galois representations studied in detail in\nprevious sections. In particular from the computations done in those sections\nwe conclude that this eigenform does not verify condition (I), (II) or (III). The\nartificial conductor for condition 1') used in section 6 and 8 was 128, which we\nare now assuming to be the conductor of the family of Galois representations\nattached to f , so conditions 1') and 1) become equivalent in this case. Therefore,\nthe conclusions of sections 6 and 8 follow, but now for all primes.\nTheorem 11.3 Assume conjecture 11.1 to be true. Then, if we call \u03c3\u03bb the\nfamily of Galois representations attached to the eigenform f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (128), C),\nwe have\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb ) = SL(3, Fl ),\nfor every l \u2261 1\n\n(mod 4), l > 5 and\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb ) = SU(3, Fl )\n\nfor every l \u2261 3 (mod 4), l > 3. In particular, these linear and unitary groups\nare Galois groups over Q.\nAs\u221aour next example we take the eigenform f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (88), C) with Qf =\nQ( \u22127) whose coefficients are listed in [vG-K-T-V] for p \u2264 173.\nWe assume that the conductor of the family of Galois representations attached\n\u221a to\nf is 88, so condition 1) defined in section 6 is satisfied because a89 = \u221260\u22124 \u22127\nis not real. This implies in particular that f does not verify condition (II). Using a89 we compute the finitely many primes with (possibly) reducible residual\nimage as described in sections 6 and 8 and we only obtain l = 2, 2879, 48889\n(except for 7 which ramifies in Qf , 11 which may divide the conductor of the\nrepresentations and 89). Looking at the reduction of a couple of characteristic\npolynomials modulo l = 89, 2879, 48889 we see that for none of them the residual representation is reducible.\nRemark: In order to simplify the determination of the primes with reducible\nimage, condition 1) can be improved by using the fact that cond(\u03b5)2 | N . In\nparticular if N is square-free the character \u03b5 becomes trivial. We will use this\nin the next example.\nAs explained in section 6, we study cases c) and d) considering all possible cubic\n(none!) and quadratic characters unramified outside 2 * 11. Using a couple of coefficients of f for each possible such character and using the equations described\nin section 6, we see that no prime l > 3 falls in these cases, i.e., the image of\nthe residual representation is not monomial for any such l. In particular, this\nimplies that f is not an\u221aeigenform verifying condition (III).\nUsing only a3 = \u22121 + \u22127 we study condition e) as in section 6 and see that\n23\n\n\fno l > 3 falls in this case, i.e., the image of the residual representation is not\nselfdual (in general sense) for any such l. It was a priori known that f is not\nan eigenform verifying condition (I) from the last assertion in theorem 11.2.\nFinally, as in section 6 and 8, we know from the possible orders of the image of\ninertia (thanks to the exclusion of the trivial case in conjecture 11.1) that the\nonly primes l > 3 such that the image may fall in one of the exceptional cases\nin the classification are: l = 5, 7, 11, 13, 19. The prime 7 ramifies in Qf and\n11 may divide the conductor. For the remaining three primes, we compute the\nreduction of some characteristic polynomials and see that there are elements in\nthe images with orders not corresponding to the order of any element in any of\nthe exceptional groups. So we conclude that the image of the residual Galois\nrepresentation is not exceptional for any l > 3. \u221a\nWe remark that for the prime l = 5, inert in Q( \u22127), we have considered (and\neliminated) the cases of exceptional image 2 * A6 or A7 that were not listed in\nsection 4 and are the only extra possibilities (see [M]).\nFrom all this we conclude:\nTheorem 11.4 Assume conjecture 11.1 to be true. Then, if we call \u03c3\u03bb the\nfamily of Galois representations attached to f , we have\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb ) = SL(3, Fl )\nfor every l such that ( \u22127\nl ) = 1, l \u2265 13 and\nImage(\u03c7\u22121 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bb ) = SU(3, Fl )\nfor every l such that ( \u22127\nl ) = \u22121, l \u2265 5.\nIn particular, these linear and unitary groups are Galois groups over Q.\nCombining the last two theorems we also have:\nCorollary 11.5 Assume conjecture 11.1 to be true. Then, the following groups\nare Galois groups over Q:\nSL(3, Fl )\nfor every l \u2261 1, 2, 4 (mod 7), l \u2265 13; and\nSU(3, Fl )\nfor every l \u2261 3, 5, 6 (mod 7), l \u2265 5.\n\u221a\nAnother example: Consider the eigenform f \u2208 H 3 (\u03930 (53), C) with Qf = Q( \u221211).\nTo check reducibility we can take the character \u03b5 as trivial, because the level is\nprime. Therefore, the congruences determining reducible primes introduced in\nsection 6.1 now hold with any ap . This and all other cases of the classification\nare dealt with as in the previous examples, using just the first few characteristic polynomials. After the computations we find 5 as the only prime greater\nthan 3 (excluding 11 and 53) such that the image seems to be not \"as large\n24\n\n\fas possible\". For this prime, as in the geometric example, the representation\nseems to be reducible with the trivial character as one-dimensional constituent\n(5 decomposes in Qf ).\nThis example, combined with the one of level 128, gives the corollary:\nCorollary 11.6 Assume conjecture 11.1. Then the following groups are Galois\ngroups over Q:\nSL(3, Fl )\nfor every l \u2261 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 (mod 11), l > 5; and\nSU(3, Fl )\nfor every l \u2261 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 (mod 11), l \u2265 5.\n\nReferences\n[A-A-C] Allison, G., Ash, A., Conrad, E., Galois Representations, Hecke Operators, and the mod-p Cohomology of GL(3, Z) with Twisted Coefficients,\nExperimental Math. 7:4, (1998) 361-390\n[A-D-P] Ash, A., Doud, D., Pollack, D., Galois representations with conjectural\nconnections with arithmetic cohomology, (2001) preprint\n[A-G-G] Ash, A., Grayson, D., Green, P., Computations of Cuspidal Cohomology of Congruence Subgroups of SL(3, Z), J.
