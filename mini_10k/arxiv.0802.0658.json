Whereas semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical Einstein equation with sources given by the expectation\nvalue of the stress-energy tensor of quantum fields, stochastic semiclassical gravity is based on\nthe Einstein-Langevin equation, which has in addition sources due to the noise kernel. The noise\nkernel is the vacuum expectation value of the (operator-valued) stress-energy bi-tensor which\ndescribes the fluctuations of quantum matter fields in curved spacetimes. A new criterion for the\nvalidity of semiclassical gravity may also be formulated from the viewpoint of this theory. In the\nfirst part, we describe the fundamentals of this new theory via two approaches: the axiomatic\nand the functional. The axiomatic approach is useful to see the structure of the theory from the\nframework of semiclassical gravity, showing the link from the mean value of the stress-energy\ntensor to their correlation functions. The functional approach uses the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time-path effective action methods which are\nconvenient for computations. It also brings out the open systems concepts and the statistical\nand stochastic contents of the theory such as dissipation, fluctuations, noise and decoherence.\nWe then focus on the properties of the stress energy bi-tensor. We obtain a general expression\nfor the noise kernel of a quantum field defined at two distinct points in an arbitrary curved\nspacetime as products of covariant derivatives of the quantum field's Green function, and show\nfrom this that the trace anomaly of the noise kernel is zero for massless conformal scalar fields.\nIn the second part, we describe three applications of stochastic gravity theory. First, we consider metric perturbations in a Minkowski spacetime. We offer an analytical solution of the\nEinstein-Langevin equation and compute the two-point correlation functions for the linearized\nEinstein tensor and for the metric perturbations. We also prove that Minkowski spacetime\nis a stable solution of semiclassical gravity. Second, we discuss structure formation from the\n\n1\n\n\fstochastic gravity viewpoint, which can go beyond the standard treatment by incorporating the\nfull quantum effect of the inflaton fluctuations. Third, we discuss the backreaction of Hawking\nradiation in the gravitational background of a quasi-static black hole (enclosed in a box). We\nderive a fluctuation-dissipation relation between the fluctuations in the radiation and the dissipative dynamics of metric fluctuations. Finally we describe the behavior of metric fluctuations\nnear the event horizon of an evaporating black hole using the Einstein-Langevin equation and\npoint out directions for further development.\n\n1\n\nOverview\n\nStochastic semiclassical gravity is a theory developed in the Nineties using semiclassical gravity\n(quantum fields in classical spacetimes, the dynamics of both matter and spacetime are solved selfconsistently) as the starting point and aiming at a theory of quantum gravity as the goal. While\nsemiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical Einstein equation with the source given by the\nexpectation value of the stress-energy tensor of quantum fields, stochastic semiclassical gravity, or\nstochastic gravity for short, includes also its fluctuations in a new stochastic semiclassical EinsteinLangevin equation (we will often use the shortened term stochastic gravity as there is no confusion\nas to the nature and source of stochasticity in gravity being induced from the quantum fields and\nnot a priori from the classical spacetime). If the centerpiece in semiclassical gravity theory is the\nvacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of a quantum field, and the central issues\nbeing how well the vacuum is defined and how the divergences can be controlled by regularization\nand renormalization, the centerpiece in stochastic semiclassical gravity theory is the stress-energy\nbi-tensor and its expectation value known as the noise kernel. The mathematical properties of this\nquantity and its physical content in relation to the behavior of fluctuations of quantum fields in\ncurved spacetimes are the central issues of this new theory. How they induce metric fluctuations\nand seed the structures of the universe, how they affect the black hole horizons and the backreaction\nof Hawking radiance in black hole dynamics, including implications on trans-Planckian physics, are\nnew horizons to explore. On the theoretical issues, stochastic gravity is the necessary foundation to\ninvestigate the validity of semiclassical gravity and the viability of inflationary cosmology based on\nthe appearance and sustenance of a vacuum energy-dominated phase. It is also a useful beachhead\nsupported by well-established low energy (sub-Planckian) physics to explore the connection with\nhigh energy (Planckian) physics in the realm of quantum gravity.\nIn this review we summarize major work and results on this theory since 1998. It is in the nature\nof a progress report rather than a review. In fact we will have room only to discuss a handful of\ntopics of basic importance. A review of ideas leading to stochastic gravity and further developments\noriginating from it can be found in Refs. [1, 2]; a set of lectures which include a discussion of the\nissue of the validity of semiclassical gravity in Ref. [3]; a pedagogical introduction of stochastic\ngravity theory with a more detailed treatment of backreaction problems in cosmology and black\nholes in quasi-equilibrium in Ref. [4]. A comprehensive formal description of the fundamentals is\ngiven in Refs. [5, 6] while that of the noise kernel in arbitrary spacetimes in Refs. [6, 7, 8]. Here\nwe will try to mention related work so the reader can at least trace out the parallel and sequential\ndevelopments. The references at the end of each topic below are representative work where one can\nseek out further treatments.\nStochastic gravity theory is built on three pillars: general relativity, quantum fields and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The first two uphold semiclassical gravity, the last two span statistical\n\n2\n\n\ffield theory. Strictly speaking one can understand a great deal without appealing to statistical mechanics, and we will try to do so here. But concepts such as quantum open systems [9, 10, 11]\nand techniques such as the influence functional [12, 13] (which is related to the closed-time-path\neffective action [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]) were a great help in our understanding\nof the physical meaning of issues involved toward the construction of this new theory, foremost\nbecause quantum fluctuations and correlation have ascended the stage and in some new paradigm\nbecome the focus. Quantum statistical field theory and the statistical mechanics of quantum field\ntheory [26, 27, 28, 29] also aided us in searching for the connection with quantum gravity through\nthe retrieval of correlations and coherence.

The reader should consult the references therein for earlier work and the background\nmaterial. We do not seek a complete coverage here, but will discuss only those selected topics in\ntheory, issues and applications. We use the (+, +, +) sign conventions of Refs. [30, 31], and units\nin which c = h\u0304 = 1.\n\n2\n\nFrom Semiclassical to Stochastic Gravity\n\nThere are three main steps that lead to the recent development of stochastic gravity. The first step\nbegins with quantum field theory in curved spacetime [172, 32, 33, 34, 35], which describes the\nbehavior of quantum matter fields propagating in a specified (not dynamically determined by the\nquantum matter field as source) background gravitational field. In this theory the gravitational field\nis given by the classical spacetime metric determined from classical sources by the classical Einstein\nequations, and the quantum fields propagate as test fields in such a spacetime. An important process\ndescribed by quantum field theory in curved spacetime is indeed particle creation from the vacuum,\nand effects of vacuum fluctuations and polarizations, in the early universe [173, 174, 175, 176, 177,\n178, 179, 180, 172, 181, 182], and Hawking radiation in black holes [183, 184, 185, 186, 187].\nThe second step in the description of the interaction of gravity with quantum fields is backreaction, i.e., the effect of the quantum fields on the spacetime geometry. The source here is the\n4\n\n\fexpectation value of the stress-energy operator for the matter fields in some quantum state in the\nspacetime, a classical observable. However, since this object is quadratic in the field operators,\nwhich are only well defined as distributions on the spacetime, it involves ill defined quantities. It\ncontains ultraviolet divergences the removal of which requires a renormalization procedure [172, 188,\n189]. The final expectation value of the stress-energy operator using a reasonable regularization\ntechnique is essentially unique, modulo some terms which depend on the spacetime curvature and\nwhich are independent of the quantum state. This uniqueness was proved by Wald [190, 191] who\ninvestigated the criteria that a physically meaningful expectation value of the stress-energy tensor\nought to satisfy.\nThe theory obtained from a self-consistent solution of the geometry of the spacetime and the\nquantum field is known as semiclassical gravity. Incorporating the backreaction of the quantum\nmatter field on the spacetime is thus the central task in semiclassical gravity. One assumes a general\nclass of spacetime where the quantum fields live in and act on, and seek a solution which satisfies\nsimultaneously the Einstein equation for the spacetime and the field equations for the quantum\nfields. The Einstein equation which has the expectation value of the stress-energy operator of the\nquantum matter field as the source is known as the semiclassical Einstein equation. Semiclassical\ngravity was first investigated in cosmological backreaction problems [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43,\n44, 45, 46], an example is the damping of anisotropy in Bianchi universes by the backreaction of\nvacuum particle creation. Using the effect of quantum field processes such as particle creation to\nexplain why the universe is so isotropic at the present was investigated in the context of chaotic\ncosmology [192, 193, 194] in the late seventies prior to the inflationary cosmology proposal of the\neighties [195, 196, 197, 198], which assumes the vacuum expectation value of an inflaton field as\nthe source, another, perhaps more well-known, example of semiclassical gravity.\n\n2.1\n\nThe importance of quantum fluctuations\n\nFor a free quantum field semiclassical gravity is fairly well understood. The theory is in some\nsense unique, since the only reasonable c-number stress-energy tensor that one may construct\n[190, 191] with the stress-energy operator is a renormalized expectation value. However the scope\nand limitations of the theory are not so well understood. It is expected that the semiclassical\ntheory would break down at the Planck scale. One can conceivably assume that it would also break\ndown when the fluctuations of the stress-energy operator are large [114, 115]. Calculations of the\nfluctuations of the energy density for Minkowski, Casimir and hot flat spaces as well as Einstein and\nde Sitter universes are available [115, 199, 116, 117, 7, 8, 6, 109, 200, 134, 201, 202]. It is less clear,\nhowever, how to quantify what a large fluctuation is, and different criteria have been proposed\n[115, 203, 204, 116, 117, 205, 113, 206, 207]. The issue of the validity of the semiclassical gravity\nviewed in the light of quantum fluctuations was discussed in our Erice lectures [3]. More recently\nin Refs. [118, 118] a new criterion has been proposed for the validity of semiclassical gravity. It is\nbased based on the quantum fluctuations of the semiclassical metric and incorporates in a unified\nand self-consistent way previous criteria that have been used [110, 113, 114, 115]. One can see the\nessence of the validity problem by the following example inspired by Ford [114].\nLet us assume a quantum state formed by an isolated system which consists of a superposition\nwith equal amplitude of one configuration of mass M with the center of mass at X1 and another\nconfiguration of the same mass with the center of mass at X2 . The semiclassical theory as described\nby the semiclassical Einstein equation predicts that the center of mass of the gravitational field of\n\n5\n\n\fthe system is centered at (X1 + X2 )/2. However, one would expect that if we send a succession\nof test particles to probe the gravitational field of the above system half of the time they would\nreact to a gravitational field of mass M centered at X1 and half of the time to the field centered at\nX2 . The two predictions are clearly different, note that the fluctuation in the position of the center\nof masses is of the order of (X1 \u2212 X2 )2 . Although this example raises the issue of how to place\nthe importance of fluctuations to the mean, a word of caution should be added to the effect that\nit should not be taken too literally. In fact, if the previous masses are macroscopic the quantum\nsystem decoheres very quickly [58, 62] and instead of being described by a pure quantum state\nit is described by a density matrix which diagonalizes in a certain pointer basis. For observables\nassociated to such a pointer basis the density matrix description is equivalent to that provided by\na statistical ensemble. The results will differ, in any case, from the semiclassical prediction.\nIn other words, one would expect that a stochastic source that describes the quantum fluctuations should enter into the semiclassical equations. A significant step in this direction was\nmade in Ref. [1] where it was proposed to view the back-reaction problem in the framework\nof an open quantum system: the quantum fields seen as the \"environment\" and the gravitational field as the \"system\". Following this proposal a systematic study of the connection between semiclassical gravity and open quantum systems resulted in the development of a new conceptual and technical framework where (semiclassical) Einstein-Langevin equations were derived\n[102, 103, 99, 104, 105, 106, 107]. The key technical factor to most of these results was the use of\nthe influence functional method of Feynman and Vernon [12] when only the coarse-grained effect of\nthe environment on the system is of interest. Note that the word semiclassical put in parentheses\nrefers to the fact that the noise source in the Einstein-Langevin equation arises from the quantum\nfield, while the background spacetime is classical; generally we will not carry this word since there\nis no confusion that the source which contributes to the stochastic features of this theory comes\nfrom quantum fields.\nIn the language of the consistent histories formulation of quantum mechanics [64, 65, 66, 67,\n68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88] for the existence\nof a semiclassical regime for the dynamics of the system one needs two requirements: The first is\ndecoherence, which guarantees that probabilities can be consistently assigned to histories describing\nthe evolution of the system, and the second is that these probabilities should peak near histories\nwhich correspond to solutions of classical equations of motion. The effect of the environment is\ncrucial, on the one hand, to provide decoherence and, on the other hand, to produce both dissipation\nand noise to the system through back-reaction, thus inducing a semiclassical stochastic dynamics\non the system. As shown by different authors [208, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], indeed\nover a long history predating the current revival of decoherence, stochastic semiclassical equations\nare obtained in an open quantum system after a coarse graining of the environmental degrees of\nfreedom and a further coarse graining in the system variables. It is expected but has not yet been\nshown that this mechanism could also work for decoherence and classicalization of the metric field.\nThus far, the analogy could be made formally [108] or under certain assumptions, such as adopting\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approximation in quantum cosmology [209, 210].\nAn alternative axiomatic approach to the Einstein-Langevin equation without invoking the\nopen system paradigm was later suggested based on the formulation of a self-consistent dynamical\nequation for a perturbative extension of semiclassical gravity able to account for the lowest order\nstress-energy fluctuations of matter fields [5]. It was shown that the same equation could be derived,\nin this general case, from the influence functional of Feynman and Vernon [6]. The field equation\n6\n\n\fis deduced via an effective action which is computed assuming that the gravitational field is a cnumber. The important new element in the derivation of the Einstein-Langevin equation, and of the\nstochastic gravity theory, is the physical observable that measures the stress-energy fluctuations,\nnamely, the expectation value of the symmetrized bi-tensor constructed with the stress-energy\ntensor operator: the noise kernel. It is interesting to note that the Einstein-Langevin equation can\nalso be understood as a useful intermediary tool to compute symmetrized two-point correlations\nof the quantum metric perturbations on the semiclassical background, independent of a suitable\nclassicalization mechanism [211].\n\n3\n\nThe Einstein-Langevin equation: Axiomatic approach\n\nIn this section we introduce stochastic semiclassical gravity, or stochastic gravity for short, in an\naxiomatic way. It is introduced as an extension of semiclassical gravity motivated by the search of\nself-consistent equations which describe the back-reaction of the quantum stress-energy fluctuations\non the gravitational field [5].\n\n3.1\n\nSemiclassical gravity\n\nSemiclassical gravity describes the interaction of a classical gravitational field with quantum matter\nfields. This theory can be formally derived as the leading 1/N approximation of quantum gravity\ninteracting with N independent and identical free quantum fields [212, 213, 214, 215] which interact\nwith gravity only. By keeping the value of N G finite, where G is Newton's gravitational constant,\none arrives at a theory in which formally the gravitational field can be treated as a c-number field\n(i.e. quantized at tree level) while matter fields are fully quantized. The semiclassical theory may\nbe summarized as follows.\nLet (M, gab ) be a globally hyperbolic four-dimensional spacetime manifold M with metric gab\nand consider a real scalar quantum field \u03c6 of mass m propagating on that manifold; we just assume\na scalar field for simplicity. The classical action Sm for this matter field is given by the functional\n1\nSm [g, \u03c6] = \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 i\n\u221a h\nd4 x \u2212g g ab \u2207a \u03c6\u2207b \u03c6 + m2 + \u03beR \u03c62 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u2207a is the covariant derivative associated to the metric gab , \u03be is a coupling parameter between\nthe field and the scalar curvature of the underlying spacetime R, and g = detgab .\nThe field may be quantized in the manifold using the standard canonical quantization formalism\n[32, 33, 34]. The field operator in the Heisenberg representation \u03c6\u0302 is an operator-valued distribution\nsolution of the Klein-Gordon equation, the field equation derived from Eq. (3.1),\n(\u2737 \u2212 m2 \u2212 \u03beR)\u03c6\u0302 = 0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe may write the field operator as \u03c6\u0302[g; x) to indicate that it is a functional of the metric gab and a\nfunction of the spacetime point x. This notation will be used also for other operators and tensors.\nThe classical stress-energy tensor is obtained by functional derivation of this action in the usual\n\u221a\nway T ab (x) = (2/ \u2212g)\u03b4Sm /\u03b4gab , leading to\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nT ab [g, \u03c6] = \u2207a \u03c6\u2207b \u03c6 \u2212 gab \u2207c \u03c6\u2207c \u03c6 + m2 \u03c62\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nab\n+\u03be g \u2737 \u2212 \u2207a \u2207b + Gab \u03c62 ,\n\n7\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere \u2737 = \u2207a \u2207a and Gab is the Einstein tensor. With the notation T ab [g, \u03c6] we explicitly indicate\nthat the stress-energy tensor is a functional of the metric gab and the field \u03c6.\nThe next step is to define a stress-energy tensor operator T\u0302 ab [g; x). Naively one would replace\nthe classical field \u03c6[g; x) in the above functional by the quantum operator \u03c6\u0302[g; x), but this procedure\ninvolves taking the product of two distributions at the same spacetime point. This is ill-defined\nand we need a regularization procedure. There are several regularization methods which one may\nuse, one is the point-splitting or point-separation regularization method [188, 189] in which one\nintroduces a point y in a neighborhood of the point x and then uses as the regulator the vector\ntangent at the point x of the geodesic joining x and y; this method is discussed for instance in\nRefs. [117, 7, 8] and in section 5. Another well known method is dimensional regularization in\nwhich one works in arbitrary n dimensions, where n is not necessarily an integer, and then uses\nas the regulator the parameter \u01eb = n \u2212 4; this method is implicitly used in this section. The\nregularized stress-energy operator using the Weyl ordering prescription, i.e. symmetrical ordering,\ncan be written as\n1\n(3.4)\nT\u0302 ab [g] = {\u2207a \u03c6\u0302[g] , \u2207b \u03c6\u0302[g]} + D ab [g] \u03c6\u03022 [g],\n2\nwhere D ab [g] is the differential operator:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nD ab \u2261 (\u03be \u2212 1/4) g ab \u2737 + \u03be Rab \u2212 \u2207a \u2207b .\n\n(3.5)\n\nNote that if dimensional regularization is used, the field operator \u03c6\u0302[g; x) propagates in a ndimensional spacetime. Once the regularization prescription has been introduced a regularized\nR [g; x) may be defined as\nand renormalized stress-energy operator T\u0302ab\nR\nC\nT\u0302ab\n[g; x) = T\u0302ab [g; x) + Fab\n[g; x)I\u02c6,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhich differs from the regularized T\u0302ab [g; x) by the identity operator times some tensor counterterms\nC [g; x), which depend on the regulator and are local functionals of the metric, see Ref. [6] for\nFab\ndetails. The field states can be chosen in such a way that for any pair of physically acceptable\nR |\u03c6i,\nstates, i.e., Hadamard states in the sense of Ref. [34], |\u03c8i, and |\u03c6i the matrix element h\u03c8|Tab\ndefined as the limit when the regulator takes the physical value, is finite and satisfies Wald's axioms\n[33, 190]. These counterterms can be extracted from the singular part of a Schwinger-DeWitt series\n[33, 188, 189, 216]. The choice of these counterterms is not unique but this ambiguity can be\nabsorbed into the renormalized coupling constants which appear in the equations of motion for the\ngravitational field.\nThe semiclassical Einstein equation for the metric gab can then be written as\nR\nGab [g] + \u039bgab \u2212 2(\u03b1Aab + \u03b2Bab )[g] = 8\u03c0GhT\u0302ab\n[g]i,\n\n(3.7)\n\nR [g]i is the expectation value of the operator T\u0302 R [g, x) after the regulator takes the physwhere hT\u0302ab\nab\nical value in some physically acceptable state of the field on (M, gab ). Note that both the stress\ntensor and the quantum state are functionals of the metric, hence the notation. The parameters G,\n\u039b, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the renormalized coupling constants, respectively, the gravitational constant, the\ncosmological constant and two dimensionless coupling constants which are zero in the classical Einstein equation. These constants must be understood as the result of \"dressing\" the bare constants\nwhich appear in the classical action before renormalization. The values of these constants must be\n\n8\n\n\fdetermined by experiment. The left hand side of Eq. (3.7) may be derived from the gravitational\naction\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n1\nabcd\n2\n4 \u221a\nSg [g] =\n+ \u03b2R ,\n(3.8)\nd x \u2212g R \u2212 \u039b + \u03b1Cabcd C\n8\u03c0G\n2\nwhere Cabcd is the Weyl tensor. The tensors Aab and Bab come from the functional derivatives with\nrespect to the metric of the terms quadratic in the curvature in Eq. (3.8), they are explicitly given\nby\n\u221a\n\u03b4\n1\n\u221a\nd4 \u2212gCcdef C cdef\n\u2212g \u03b4gab\n1 ab\n2\n=\ng Ccdef C cdef \u2212 2Racde Rbcde + 4Rac Rcb \u2212 RRab\n2\n3\n1\n2\n(3.9)\n\u22122\u2737Rab + \u2207a \u2207b R + gab \u2737R,\n3\n3\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03b4\n1\nd4 \u2212gR2\nB ab = \u221a\n\u2212g \u03b4gab\n1 ab 2\n=\ng R \u2212 2RRab + 2\u2207a \u2207b R \u2212 2gab \u2737R,\n(3.10)\n2\nwhere Rabcd and Rab are the Riemann and Ricci tensors, respectively. These two tensors are, like\nthe Einstein and metric tensors, symmetric and divergenceless: \u2207a Aab = 0 = \u2207a Bab .\nA solution of semiclassical gravity consists of a spacetime (M, gab ), a quantum field operator\n\u03c6\u0302[g] which satisfies the evolution equation (3.2), and a physically acceptable state |\u03c8[g]i for this\nfield, such that Eq. (3.7) is satisfied when the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy\noperator is evaluated in this state.\nFor a free quantum field this theory is robust in the sense that it is self-consistent and fairly well\nunderstood. As long as the gravitational field is assumed to be described by a classical metric, the\nabove semiclassical Einstein equations seems to be the only plausible dynamical equation for this\nmetric: the metric couples to matter fields via the stress-energy tensor and for a given quantum\nstate the only physically observable c-number stress-energy tensor that one can construct is the\nabove renormalized expectation value. However, lacking a full quantum gravity theory the scope\nand limits of the theory are not so well understood. It is assumed that the semiclassical theory\nshould break down at Planck scales, which is when simple order of magnitude estimates suggest that\nthe quantum effects of gravity should not be ignored because the energy of a quantum fluctuation\nin a Planck size region, as determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is comparable to\nthe gravitational energy of that fluctuation.\nThe theory is expected to break down when the fluctuations of the stress-energy operator are\nlarge [114]. A criterion based on the ratio of the fluctuations to the mean was proposed by Kuo\nand Ford [115] (see also work via zeta-function methods [199, 202]). This proposal was questioned\nby Phillips and Hu [116, 117, 7] because it does not contain a scale at which the theory is probed\nor how accurately the theory can be resolved. They suggested the use of a smearing scale or pointseparation distance, for integrating over the bi-tensor quantities, equivalent to a stipulation of the\nresolution level of measurements; see also the response by Ford [203, 204]. A different criterion\nis recently suggested by Anderson et al. [205, 113] based on linear response theory. A partial\nsummary of this issue can be found in our Erice Lectures [3].\nMore recently, in collaboration with A. Roura [118, 119], we have proposed a criterion for the\nvalidity of semiclassical gravity which is based on the stability of the solutions of the semiclassical\nAab =\n\nZ\n\n9\n\n\fEinstein equations with respect to quantum metric fluctuations. The two-point correlations for\nthe metric perturbations can be described in the framework of stochastic gravity, which is closely\nrelated to the quantum theory of gravity interacting with N matter fields, to leading order in a\n1/N expansion. We will describe these developments in the following sections.\n\n3.2\n\nStochastic gravity\n\nThe purpose of stochastic gravity is to extend the semiclassical theory to account for these fluctuations in a self-consistent way. A physical observable that describes these fluctuations to lowest order\nis the noise kernel bi-tensor, which is defined through the two-point correlation of the stress-energy\noperator as\n1\n(3.11)\nNabcd [g; x, y) = h{t\u0302ab [g; x), t\u0302cd [g; y)}i,\n2\nwhere the curly brackets mean anticommutator, and where\nt\u0302ab [g; x) \u2261 T\u0302ab [g; x) \u2212 hT\u0302ab [g; x)i.\n\n(3.12)\n\nThis bi-tensor can also be written Nab,c\u2032 d\u2032 [g; x, y), or Nab,c\u2032 d\u2032 (x, y) as we do in section 5, to emphasize\nthat it is a tensor with respect to the first two indices at the point x and a tensor with respect to\nthe last two indices at the point y, but we shall not follow this notation here. The noise kernel\nis defined in terms of the unrenormalized stress-tensor operator T\u0302ab [g; x) on a given background\nmetric gab , thus a regulator is implicitly assumed on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.11). However,\nfor a linear quantum field the above kernel \u2013 the expectation function of a bi-tensor \u2013 is free of\nR [g; x) by\nultraviolet divergences because the regularized Tab [g; x) differs from the renormalized Tab\nthe identity operator times some tensor counterterms, see Eq. (3.6), so that in the subtraction\n(3.12) the counterterms cancel. Consequently the ultraviolet behavior of hT\u0302ab (x)T\u0302cd (y)i is the\nR in\nsame as that of hT\u0302ab (x)ihT\u0302cd (y)i, and T\u0302ab can be replaced by the renormalized operator T\u0302ab\nEq. (3.11); an alternative proof of this result is given in Ref. [7, 8]. The noise kernel should\nbe thought of as a distribution function, the limit of coincidence points has meaning only in the\nsense of distributions. The bi-tensor Nabcd [g; x, y), or Nabcd (x, y) for short, is real and positive\nR being self-adjoint. A simple proof is given in Ref. [4].\nsemi-definite, as a consequence of T\u0302ab\nOnce the fluctuations of the stress-energy operator have been characterized we can perturbatively extend the semiclassical theory to account for such fluctuations. Thus we will assume that\nthe background spacetime metric gab is a solution of the semiclassical Einstein Eqs. (3.7) and we\nwill write the new metric for the extended theory as gab + hab , where we will assume that hab is a\nperturbation to the background solution. The renormalized stress-energy operator and the state of\nR [g + h] and |\u03c8[g + h]i, respectively, and hT\u0302 R [g + h]i\nthe quantum field may now be denoted by T\u0302ab\nab\nwill be the corresponding expectation value.\nLet us now introduce a Gaussian stochastic tensor field \u03beab [g; x) defined by the following correlators:\nh\u03beab [g; x)is = 0, h\u03beab [g; x)\u03becd [g; y)is = Nabcd [g; x, y),\n(3.13)\nwhere h. . .is means statistical average. The symmetry and positive semi-definite property of the\nnoise kernel guarantees that the stochastic field tensor \u03beab [g, x), or \u03beab (x) for short, just introduced\nis well defined. Note that this stochastic tensor captures only partially the quantum nature of the\nfluctuations of the stress-energy operator since it assumes that cumulants of higher order are zero.\n\n10\n\n\fAn important property of this stochastic tensor is that it is covariantly conserved in the backR [g] one can see\nground spacetime \u2207a \u03beab [g; x) = 0. In fact, as a consequence of the conservation of T\u0302ab\na\nthat \u2207x Nabcd (x, y) = 0. Taking the divergence in Eq. (3.13) one can then show that h\u2207a \u03beab is = 0\nand h\u2207ax \u03beab (x)\u03becd (y)is = 0 so that \u2207a \u03beab is deterministic and represents with certainty the zero\nvector field in M.\nFor a conformal field, i.e., a field whose classical action is conformally invariant, \u03beab is traceless:\nab\ng \u03beab [g; x) = 0; so that, for a conformal matter field the stochastic source gives no correction to the\nR [g] is, in this case, a\ntrace anomaly. In fact, from the trace anomaly result which states that g ab T\u0302ab\nlocal c-number functional of gab times the identity operator, we have that gab (x)Nabcd [g; x, y) = 0.\nIt then follows from Eq. (3.13) that hgab \u03beab is = 0 and hgab (x)\u03beab (x)\u03becd (y)is = 0; an alternative\nproof based on the point-separation method is given in Ref. [7, 8], see also section 5.\nAll these properties make it quite natural to incorporate into the Einstein equations the stressenergy fluctuations by using the stochastic tensor \u03beab [g; x) as the source of the metric perturbations.\nThus we will write the following equation.\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nR\n[g+h]i+\u03beab [g] .\nGab [g+h]+\u039b(gab +hab ) \u2212 2(\u03b1Aab + \u03b2Bab )[g+h] = 8\u03c0G hT\u0302ab\n\n(3.14)\n\nThis equation is in the form of a (semiclassical) Einstein-Langevin equation, it is a dynamical\nequation for the metric perturbation hab to linear order. It describes the back-reaction of the\nmetric to the quantum fluctuations of the stress-energy tensor of matter fields, and gives a first\norder extension to semiclassical gravity as described by the semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7).\nNote that we refer to the Einstein-Langevin equation as a first order extension to semiclassical\nEinstein equation of semiclassical gravity and the lowest level representation of stochastic gravity.\nHowever, stochastic gravity has a much broader meaning, it refers to the range of theories based on\nsecond and higher order correlation functions. Noise can be defined in effectively open systems (e.g.\ncorrelation noise [29] in the Schwinger-Dyson equation hierarchy) to some degree but one should\nnot expect the Langevin form to prevail. In this sense we say stochastic gravity is the intermediate\ntheory between semiclassical gravity (a mean field theory based on the expectation values of the\nenergy momentum tensor of quantum fields) and quantum gravity (the full hierarchy of correlation\nfunctions retaining complete quantum coherence [2, 170].\nThe renormalization of the operator T\u0302ab [g + h] is carried out exactly as in the previous case,\nnow in the perturbed metric gab + hab . Note that the stochastic source \u03beab [g; x) is not dynamical,\nit is independent of hab since it describes the fluctuations of the stress tensor on the semiclassical\nbackground gab .\nAn important property of the Einstein-Langevin equation is that it is gauge invariant under the\nchange of hab by h\u2032ab = hab + \u2207a \u03b6b + \u2207b \u03b6a , where \u03b6 a is a stochastic vector field on the background\nmanifold M. Note that a tensor such as Rab [g +h], transforms as Rab [g +h\u2032 ] = Rab [g +h]+L\u03b6 Rab [g]\nto linear order in the perturbations, where L\u03b6 is the Lie derivative with respect to \u03b6 a . Now, let\nus write the source tensors in Eqs. (3.14) and (3.7) to the left-hand sides of these equations. If we\nsubstitute h by h\u2032 in this new version of Eq. (3.14), we get the same expression, with h instead of h\u2032 ,\nplus the Lie derivative of the combination of tensors which appear on the left-hand side of the new\nEq. (3.7). This last combination vanishes when Eq. (3.7) is satisfied, i.e., when the background\nmetric gab is a solution of semiclassical gravity.\nFrom the statistical average of equation (3.14) we have that gab + hhab is must be a solution of\nthe semiclassical Einstein equation linearized around the background gab ; this solution has been\n11\n\n\fproposed as a test for the validity of the semiclassical approximation [205, 113] a point that will be\nfurther discussed in section 3.3.\nThe stochastic equation (3.14) predicts that the gravitational field has stochastic fluctuations\nover the background gab . This equation is linear in hab , thus its solutions can be written as follows,\nhab (x) =\n\nh0ab (x)\n\n+ 8\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n4 \u2032\n\nd x\n\nq\n\n\u2032 cd \u2032\n\u2212g(x\u2032 )Gret\nabcd (x, x )\u03be (x ),\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere h0ab (x) is the solution of the homogeneous equation containing information on the initial\n\u2032\nconditions and Gret\nabcd (x, x ) is the retarded propagator of equation (3.14) with vanishing initial\nconditions. Form this we obtain the two-point correlation functions for the metric perturbations:\nhhab (x)hcd (y)is = hh0ab (x)h0cd (y)is +\n2\n\n(8\u03c0G)\n\nZ\n\nq\n\n\u2032\nef gh \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\nd4 x\u2032 d4 y \u2032 g(x\u2032 )g(y \u2032 )Gret\n(x , y )Gret\nabef (x, x )N\ncdgh (y, y )\n\n\u2261 hhab (x)hcd (y)iint + hhab (x)hcd (y)iind .\n\n(3.16)\n\nThere are two different contributions to the two-point correlations, which we have distinguished\nin the second equality. The first one is connected to the fluctuations of the initial state of the\nmetric perturbations, and we will refer to them as intrinsic fluctuations. The second contribution\nis proportional to the noise kernel and is thus connected with the fluctuations of the quantum\nfields, we will refer to them as induced fluctuations. To find these two-point stochastic correlation\nfunctions one needs to know the noise kernel Nabcd (x, y). Explicit expressions of this kernel in terms\nof the two-point Wightman functions is given in [6], expressions based on point-splitting methods\nhave also been given in [217, 7]. Note that the noise kernel should be thought of as a distribution\nfunction, the limit of coincidence points has meaning only in the sense of distributions.\nThe two-point stochastic correlation functions for the metric perturbations of Eq. (3.16) satisfy\na very important property. In fact, it can be shown that they correspond exactly to the symmetrized\ntwo-point correlation functions for the quantum metric perturbations in the large N expansion, i.e.\nthe quantum theory describing the interaction of the gravitational field with N arbitrary free fields\nand expanded in powers of 1/N . To leading order for the graviton propagator one finds that\nh{\u0125ab (x), \u0125cd (y)}i = 2 hhab (x)hcd (y)is ,\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere \u0125ab (x) mean the quantum operator corresponding to the metric perturbations and the statistical average in Eq. (3.16) for the homogeneous solutions is now taken with respect to the Wigner\ndistribution that describes the initial quantum state of the metric perturbations. The Lorentz\ngauge condition \u2207a (hab \u2212 (1/2)\u03b7ab hcc ) = 0 as well as some initial condition to completely fix the\ngauge of the initial state should be implicitly understood, moreover since there are now N scalar\nfields the stochastic source has been rescaled so that the two-point correlation defined by Eq. (3.13)\nshould be 1/N times the noise kernel of a single field. This result was implicitly obtained in the\nMinkowski background in Ref. [109] where the two-point correlation in the stochastic context was\ncomputed for the linearized metric perturbations. This stochastic correlation exactly agrees with\nthe symmetrized part of the graviton propagator computed by Tomboulis [215] in the quantum context of gravity interacting with N Fermion fields, where the graviton propagator is of order 1/N .\nThis result can be extended to an arbitrary background in the context of the large N expansion, a\nsketch of the proof with explicit details in the Minkowski background can be found in Ref. [118].\n12\n\n\fThis connection between the stochastic correlations and the quantum correlations was noted and\nstudied in detail in the context of simpler open quantum systems [218]. Stochastic gravity goes\nbeyond semiclassical gravity in the following sense. The semiclassical theory, which is based on the\nexpectation value of the stress energy tensor, carries information on the field two-point correlations\nonly, since hT\u0302ab i is quadratic in the field operator \u03c6\u0302. The stochastic theory on the other hand, is\nbased on the noise kernel (3.11) which is quartic in the field operator. However, it does not carry\ninformation on the graviton-graviton interaction, which in the context of the large N expansion\ngives diagrams of order 1/N 2 . This will be illustrated in section 3.3.1. Furthermore the retarded\npropagator gives also information on the commutator\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nret\nh[\u0125ab (x), \u0125cd (y)]i = 16\u03c0iG Gret\nabcd (y, x) \u2212 Gabcd (x, y) ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nso that combining the commutator with the anticommutator the quantum two-point correlation\nfunctions are determined. Moreover, assuming a Gaussian initial state with vanishing expectation\nvalue for the metric perturbations any n-point quantum correlation function is determined by the\ntwo-point quantum correlations and thus by the stochastic approach. Consequently, one may regard\nthe Einstein-Langevin equation as a useful intermediary tool to compute the correlation functions\nfor the quantum metric perturbations.\nWe should, however, emphasize also that Langevin like equations are obtained to describe the\nquantum to classical transition in open quantum systems, when quantum decoherence takes place\nby coarse graining of the environment as well as by suitable coarse graining of the system variables\n[208, 219, 73, 74, 75, 220]. In those cases the stochastic correlation functions describe actual classical\ncorrelations of the system variables. Examples can be found in the case of a moving charged particle\nin an electromagnetic field in quantum electrodynamics [221] and in several quantum Brownian\nmodels [218, 222, 223].\n\n3.3\n\nValidity of semiclassical gravity\n\nAs we have emphasized earlier the scope and limits of semiclassical gravity are not well understood\nbecause we still lack a fully well understood quantum theory of gravity. From the semiclassical\nEinstein equations it seems also clear that the semiclassical theory should break down when the\nquantum fluctuations of the stress tensor are large. Ford [114] was among the first to have emphasized the importance of these quantum fluctuations. It is less clear, however, how to quantify the\nsize of these fluctuations. Kuo and Ford [115] used the variance of the fluctuations of the stress\ntensor operator compared to the mean value as a measure of the validity of semiclassical gravity.\nHu and Phillips pointed out [116, 117] that such a criterion should be refined by considering the\nback-reaction of those fluctuations on the metric. Ford and collaborators also noticed that the\nmetric fluctuations associated to the matter fluctuations can be meaningfully classified as active\n[121, 206, 207] and passive [114, 115, 224, 204], which correspond to our intrinsic and induced\nfluctuations, respectively, and have studied their properties in different contexts [225, 226, 227].\nHowever, these fluctuations are not treated in a unified way and their precise relation to the\nquantum correlation function for the metric perturbations is not discussed. Furthermore, the full\naveraged back-reaction of the matter fields is not included self-consistently, and the contribution\nfrom the vacuum fluctuations in Minkowski space is discarded.\nA different approach to the validity of semiclassical gravity was pioneered by Horowitz [110, 111]\nwho studied the stability of a semiclassical solution with respect to linear metric perturbations. In\n13\n\n\fthe case of a free quantum matter field in its Minkowski vacuum state, flat spacetime is a solution\nof semiclassical gravity. The equations describing those metric perturbations involve higher order\nderivatives, and Horowitz found unstable runaway solutions that grow exponentially with characteristic timescales comparable to the Planck time; see also the analysis by Jordan [24]. Later,\nSimon [112, 228], argued that those unstable solutions lie beyond the expected domain of validity of\nthe theory and emphasized that only those solutions which resulted from truncating perturbative\nexpansions in terms of the square of the Planck length are physically acceptable [112, 228]. Further\ndiscussion was provided by Flanagan and Wald [229], who advocated the use of an order reduction\nprescription first introduced by Parker and Simon [230]. More recently Anderson, Molina-Par\u0131\u0301s\nand Mottola have taken up the issue of the validity of semiclassical gravity [205, 113] again. Their\nstarting point is the fact that the semiclassical Einstein equation will fail to provide a valid description of the dynamics of the mean spacetime geometry whenever the higher order radiative\ncorrections to the effective action, involving loops of gravitons or internal graviton propagators, become important. Next, they argue qualitatively that such higher order radiative corrections cannot\nbe neglected if the metric fluctuations grow without bound. Finally, they propose a criterion to\ncharacterize the growth of the metric fluctuations, and hence the validity of semiclassical gravity,\nbased on the stability of the solutions of the linearized semiclassical equation. Following these approaches the Minkowski metric is shown to be a stable solution of semiclassical gravity with respect\nto small metric perturbations.\nAs emphasized in Refs. [205, 113] the above criteria may be understood as criteria based on\nsemiclassical gravity itself. It is certainly true that stability is a necessary condition for the validity\nof a semiclassical solution, but one may also look for criteria within extensions of semiclassical\ngravity. In the absence of a quantum theory of gravity such criteria may be found in some more\nmodest extensions. Thus, Ford [114] considered graviton production in linearized quantum gravity and compared the results with the production of gravitational waves in semiclassical gravity.\nAshtekar [231] and Beetle [232] found large quantum gravity effects in three-dimensional quantum\ngravity models. In a more recent paper [118] (see also Ref. [119]), we advocate for a criteria within\nthe stochastic gravity approach, and since stochastic gravity extends semiclassical gravity by incorporating the quantum stress tensor fluctuations of the matter fields, this criteria is structurally\nthe most complete to date.\nIt turns out that this validity criteria is equivalent to the validity criteria that one might\nadvocate within the large N expansion, that is the quantum theory describing the interaction of\nthe gravitational field with N identical free matter fields. In the leading order, namely the limit\nin which N goes to infinity and the gravitational constant is appropriately rescaled, the theory\nreproduces semiclassical gravity. Thus, a natural extension of semiclassical gravity is provided\nby the next to leading order. It turns out that the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation\nfunctions of the metric perturbations in the large N expansion are equivalent to the two-point\nstochastic metric correlation functions predicted by stochastic gravity. Our validity criterion can\nthen be formulated as follows: a solution of semiclassical gravity is valid when it is stable with\nrespect to quantum metric perturbations. This criterion involves the consideration of quantum\ncorrelation functions of the metric perturbations, since the quantum field describing the metric\nperturbations \u0125ab (x) is characterized not only by its expectation value but also by its n-point\ncorrelation functions.\nIt is important to emphasize that the above validity criterion incorporates in a unified and selfconsistent way the two main ingredients of the criteria exposed above. Namely, the criteria based on\n14\n\n\fthe quantum stress tensor fluctuations of the matter fields, and the criteria based on the stability of\nsemiclassical solutions against classical metric perturbations. The former is incorporated through\nthe induced metric fluctuations, and the later through the intrinsic fluctuations introduced in Eq.\n(3.16). Whereas information on the stability of the intrisic metric fluctuations can be obtained from\nan analysis of the solutions of the perturbed semiclassical Einstein equation, the homogeneous part\nof Eq. (3.14), the effect of the induced metric fluctuations is accounted only in stochastic gravity,\nthe full inhomogeneous Eq. (3.14). We will illustrate this criteria in section 6.5 by studying the\nstability of Minkowski spacetime as a solution of semiclassical gravity.\n3.3.1\n\nThe large N expansion\n\nTo illustrate the relation between the semiclassical, stochastic and quantum theories, a simplified\nmodel of scalar gravity interacting with N scalar fields is considered here.\nThe large N expansion has been successfully used in quantum chromodynamics to compute\nsome non-perturbative results. This expansion re-sums and rearranges Feynman perturbative series\nincluding self-energies. For gravity interacting with N matter fields it shows that graviton loops\nare of higher order than matter loops. To illustrate the large N expansion let us, first, consider the\nfollowing toy model of gravity, which we will simplify as a scalar field h, interacting with a single\nscalar field \u03c6 described by the action\nS =\n\n1\nd4 x (\u2202a h\u2202 a h + h \u2202a h\u2202 a h + . . .)\n\u03baZ\nZ\nZ\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nd4 x \u2202a \u03c6\u2202 a \u03c6 + m2 \u03c62 +\n\nd4 x (h \u2202a \u03c6\u2202 a \u03c6 + . . .) ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 8\u03c0G, and we have assumed that the interaction is linear in the (dimensionless) scalar\ngravitational field h and quadratic in the matter field \u03c6 to simulate in a simplified way the coupling\nof the metric with the stress tensor of the matter fields. We have also included a self coupling\ngraviton term of O(h3 ) which also appears in perturbative gravity beyond the linear approximation.\nWe may now compute the dressed graviton propagator perturbatively as the following series\nof Feynman diagrams. The first diagram is just the free graviton propagator which is of O(\u03ba), as\none can see from the kinetic term for the graviton in equation (3.19). The next diagram is one\nloop of matter with two external legs which are the graviton propagators. This diagram has two\nvertices with one graviton propagator and two matter field propagators. Since the vertices and\nthe matter propagators contribute with 1 and each graviton propagator contributes with a \u03ba this\ndiagram is of order O(\u03ba2 ). The next diagram contains two loops of matter and three gravitons,\nand consequently it is of order O(\u03ba3 ). There will also be terms with one graviton loop and two\ngraviton propagators as external legs, with three graviton propagators at the two vertices due to\nthe O(h3 ) term in the action (3.19). Since there are four graviton propagators which carry a \u03ba4\nbut two vertices which have \u03ba\u22122 this diagram is of order O(\u03ba2 ), like the term with one matter loop.\nThus, in this perturbative expansion a graviton loop and a matter loop both contribute at the same\norder to the dressed graviton propagator.\nLet us now consider the large N expansion. We assume that the gravitational field is coupled\nwith a large number of identical fields \u03c6j , j = 1, . . . , N which couple only with h. Next we rescale\nthe gravitational coupling in such a way that \u03ba\u0304 = \u03baN is finite even when N goes to infinity. The\n\n15\n\n\faction of this system is:\nS =\n\nN\n\u03ba\u0304\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nd4 x (\u2202a h\u2202 a h + h \u2202a h\u2202 a h + . . .)\n\nN Z\nX\nj\n\n4\n\n\u0010\n\na\n\n2 2\n\nd x \u2202a \u03c6j \u2202 \u03c6j + m \u03c6\n\n\u0011\n\n+\n\nN Z\nX\n\nd4 x (h \u2202a \u03c6j \u2202 a \u03c6j + . . .) .\n\n(3.20)\n\nj\n\nNow an expansion in powers of 1/N of the dressed graviton propagator is given by the following\nseries of Feynman diagrams. The first diagram is the free graviton propagator which is now of order\nO(\u03ba\u0304/N ) the following diagrams are N identical Feynman diagrams with one loop of matter and\ntwo graviton propagators as external legs, each diagram due to the two graviton propagators is of\norder O(\u03ba\u03042 /N 2 ) but since there are N of them the sum can be represented by a single diagram with\na loop of matter of weight N , and therefore this diagram is of order O(\u03ba\u03042 /N ). This means that it\nis of the same order as the first diagram in an expansion in 1/N . Then there are the diagrams with\ntwo loops of matter and three graviton propagators, as before we can assign a weight of N to each\nloop and taking into account the three graviton propagators this diagram is of order O(\u03ba\u03043 /N ), and\nso on. This means that to order 1/N the dressed graviton propagator contains all the perturbative\nseries in powers of \u03ba\u0304 of the matter loops.\nNext, there is a diagram with one graviton loop and two graviton legs. Let us count the order\nof this diagram: it contains four graviton propagators and two vertices, the propagators contribute\nas (\u03ba\u0304/N )4 and the vertices as (N/\u03ba\u0304)2 , thus this diagram is of O(\u03ba\u03042 /N 2 ). Therefore graviton loop\ncontributes to higher order in the 1/N expansion than matter loops. Similarly there are N diagrams\nwith one loop of matter with an internal graviton propagator and two external graviton legs. Thus\nwe have three graviton propagators and since there are N of them, their sum is of order O(\u03ba\u03043 /N 2 ).\nTo summarize, we have that when N \u2192 \u221e there are no graviton propagators and gravity is classical\nyet the matter fields are quantized, this is semiclassical gravity as was first described in Ref. [214].\nThen we go to the next to leading order, 1/N , now the graviton propagator includes all matter\nloop contributions, but no contributions from graviton loops or internal graviton propagators in\nmatter loops. This is what stochastic gravity reproduces.\nThat stochastic gravity is connected to the large N expansion can be seen from the stochastic\ncorrelations of linear metric perturbations on the Minkowski background computed in Ref. [109].\nThese correlations are in exact agreement with the imaginary part of the graviton propagator\nfound by Tomboulis in the large N expansion for the quantum theory of gravity interacting with\nN Fermion fields [215]. This has been proved in detail in Ref. [118], see also [119], where the case\nof a general background is also briefly discussed.\n\n4\n\nThe Einstein-Langevin equation: Functional approach\n\nThe Einstein-Langevin equation (3.14) may also be derived by a method based on functional techniques [6]. Here we will summarize these techniques starting with semiclassical gravity.\nIn semiclassical gravity functional methods were used to study the back-reaction of quantum\nfields in cosmological models [38, 41, 42]. The primary advantage of the effective action approach\nis, in addition to the well-known fact that it is easy to introduce perturbation schemes like loop\nexpansion and nPI formalisms, that it yields a fully self-consistent solution. (For a general discussion\nin the semiclassical context of these two approaches, equation of motion versus effective action,\n16\n\n\fcontrast e.g., [36, 37, 39, 40] with the above references and [43, 44, 45, 46]. See also comments in Sec.\n5.6 on the black hole backreaction problem comparing the approach by York et al. [233, 234, 235]\nversus that of Sinha, Raval and Hu [142].\nThe well known in-out effective action method treated in textbooks, however, led to equations of\nmotion which were not real because they were tailored to compute transition elements of quantum\noperators rather than expectation values. The correct technique to use for the backreaction problem\nis the Schwinger-Keldysh [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] closed-time-path (CTP) or 'in-in' effective\naction. These techniques were adapted to the gravitational context [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 96] and\napplied to different problems in cosmology. One could deduce the semiclassical Einstein equation\nfrom the CTP effective action for the gravitational field (at tree level) with quantum matter fields.\nFurthermore, in this case the CTP functional formalism turns out to be related [18, 102, 104,\n236, 237, 100, 141, 238, 239, 6, 108] to the influence functional formalism of Feynman and Vernon\n[12] since the full quantum system may be understood as consisting of a distinguished subsystem\n(the \"system\" of interest) interacting with the remaining degrees of freedom (the environment). Integrating out the environment variables in a CTP path integral yields the influence functional, from\nwhich one can define an effective action for the dynamics of the system [102, 99, 240, 237]. This\napproach to semiclassical gravity is motivated by the observation [1] that in some open quantum\nsystems classicalization and decoherence [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63] on the system may be\nbrought about by interaction with an environment, the environment being in this case the matter\nfields and some \"high-momentum\" gravitational modes [89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 220]. Unfortunately, since the form of a complete quantum theory of gravity interacting with matter is unknown,\nwe do not know what these \"high-momentum\" gravitational modes are. Such a fundamental quantum theory might not even be a field theory, in which case the metric and scalar fields would not\nbe fundamental objects [2]. Thus, in this case, we cannot attempt to evaluate the influence action\nof Feynman and Vernon starting from the fundamental quantum theory and performing the path\nintegrations in the environment variables. Instead, we introduce the influence action for an effective quantum field theory of gravity and matter [241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 209, 210], in which such\n\"high-momentum\" gravitational modes are assumed to have already been \"integrated out.\"\n\n4.1\n\nInfluence action for semiclassical gravity\n\nLet us formulate semiclassical gravity in this functional framework. Adopting the usual procedure\nof effective field theories [246, 247, 241, 242, 243, 244, 248], one has to take the effective action for\nthe metric and the scalar field of the most general local form compatible with general covariance:\nS[g, \u03c6] \u2261 Sg [g] + Sm [g, \u03c6] + * * * , where Sg [g] and Sm [g, \u03c6] are given by Eqs. (3.8) and (3.1),\nrespectively, and the dots stand for terms of order higher than two in the curvature and in the\nnumber of derivatives of the scalar field. Here, we shall neglect the higher order terms as well\nas self-interaction terms for the scalar field. The second order terms are necessary to renormalize\none-loop ultraviolet divergences of the scalar field stress-energy tensor, as we have already seen.\nSince M is a globally hyperbolic manifold, we can foliate it by a family of t = constant Cauchy\nhypersurfaces \u03a3t , and we will indicate the initial and final times by ti and tf , respectively.\nThe influence functional corresponding to the action (3.1) describing a scalar field in a spacetime\n(coupled to a metric field) may be introduced as a functional of two copies of the metric, denoted\n\u2212\n+\n, which coincide at some final time t = tf . Let us assume that, in the quantum\nand gab\nby gab\neffective theory, the state of the full system (the scalar and the metric fields) in the Schr\u00f6dinger\n\n17\n\n\fpicture at the initial time t = ti can be described by a density operator which can be written as\nthe tensor product of two operators on the Hilbert spaces of the metric and of the scalar field. Let\n\u03c1i (ti ) \u2261 \u03c1i [\u03c6+ (ti ), \u03c6\u2212 (ti )] be the matrix element of the density operator \u03c1\u0302S (ti ) describing the initial\nstate of the scalar field. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional is defined as the following path\nintegral over the two copies of the scalar field:\nFIF [g \u00b1 ] \u2261\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c6+ D\u03c6\u2212 \u03c1i (ti )\u03b4[\u03c6+ (tf )\u2212\u03c6\u2212 (tf )] ei(Sm [g\n\n+ ,\u03c6\n\n+ ]\u2212Sm [g\n\n\u2212 ,\u03c6\n\n\u2212]\n\n).\n\n(4.1)\n\nAlternatively, the above double path integral can be rewritten as a closed time path (CTP) integral,\nnamely, as a single path integral in a complex time contour with two different time branches, one\ngoing forward in time from ti to tf , and the other going backward in time from tf to ti (in practice\none usually takes ti \u2192 \u2212\u221e). From this influence functional, the influence action SIF [g+ , g\u2212 ], or\nSIF [g\u00b1 ] for short, defined by\n\u00b1\nFIF [g\u00b1 ] \u2261 eiSIF [g ] ,\n(4.2)\ncarries all the information about the environment (the matter fields) relevant to the system (the\ngravitational field). Then we can define the CTP effective action for the gravitational field, Seff [g\u00b1 ],\nas\nSeff [g\u00b1 ] \u2261 Sg [g+ ] \u2212 Sg [g \u2212 ] + SIF [g\u00b1 ].\n(4.3)\nThis is the effective action for the classical gravitational field in the CTP formalism. However,\nsince the gravitational field is treated only at the tree level, this is also the effective classical action\nfrom which the classical equations of motion can be derived.\nExpression (4.1) contains ultraviolet divergences and must be regularized. We shall assume\nthat dimensional regularization can be applied, that is, it makes sense to dimensionally continue all\nthe quantities that appear in Eq. (4.1). For this we need to work with the n-dimensional actions\ncorresponding to Sm in (4.1) and Sg in (3.8). For example, the parameters G, \u039b \u03b1 and \u03b2 of Eq. (3.8)\nare the bare parameters GB , \u039bB , \u03b1B and \u03b2B , and in Sg [g], instead of the square of the Weyl tensor\nin Eq. (3.8), one must use (2/3)(Rabcd Rabcd \u2212 Rab Rab ) which by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem leads\nto the same equations of motion as the action (3.8) when n = 4. The form of Sg in n dimensions\nis suggested by the Schwinger-DeWitt analysis of the ultraviolet divergences in the matter stressenergy tensor using dimensional regularization. One can then write the Feynman-Vernon effective\naction Seff [g\u00b1 ] in Eq. (4.3) in a form suitable for dimensional regularization. Since both Sm and Sg\ncontain second order derivatives of the metric, one should also add some boundary terms [31, 99].\nThe effect of these terms is to cancel out the boundary terms which appear when taking variations\n\u2212\n+\nfixed at \u03a3ti and \u03a3tf . Alternatively, in order to obtain\nand gab\nof Seff [g\u00b1 ] keeping the value of gab\nthe equations of motion for the metric in the semiclassical regime, we can work with the action\nterms without boundary terms and neglect all boundary terms when taking variations with respect\n\u00b1\n. From now on, all the functional derivatives with respect to the metric will be understood\nto gab\nin this sense.\nThe semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7) can now be derived. Using the definition of the stress\u221a\nenergy tensor T ab (x) = (2/ \u2212g)\u03b4Sm /\u03b4gab and the definition of the influence functional, Eqs. (4.1)\nand (4.2), we see that\n\u03b4SIF [g \u00b1 ]\n2\nhT\u0302 ab [g; x)i = p\n,\n(4.4)\n+\n(x) g\u00b1 =g\n\u2212g(x) \u03b4gab\n18\n\n\fwhere the expectation value is taken in the n-dimensional spacetime generalization of the state\n+\n, and then\ndescribed by \u03c1\u0302S (ti ). Therefore, differentiating Seff [g \u00b1 ] in Eq. (4.3) with respect to gab\n\u2212\n+\nsetting gab = gab = gab , we get the semiclassical Einstein equation in n dimensions. This equation is\nthen renormalized by absorbing the divergences in the regularized hT\u0302 ab [g]i into the bare parameters.\nTaking the limit n \u2192 4 we obtain the physical semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7).\n\n4.2\n\nInfluence action for stochastic gravity\n\nIn the spirit of the previous derivation of the Einstein-Langevin equation, we now seek a dynamical\nequation for a linear perturbation hab to the semiclassical metric gab , solution of Eq. (3.7). Strictly\nspeaking if we use dimensional regularization we must consider the n-dimensional version of that\nequation. From the results just described, if such an equation were simply a linearized semiclassical\nEinstein equation, it could be obtained from an expansion of the effective action Seff [g + h\u00b1 ]. In\nparticular, since, from Eq.

The procedure is well known [102, 99, 104, 249, 250, 251, 252]: it consists of deriving a\nnew \"stochastic\" effective action from the observation that the effect of the imaginary part of the\ninfluence action (4.9) on the corresponding influence functional is equivalent to the averaged effect\nof the stochastic source \u03be ab coupled linearly to the perturbations h\u00b1\nab .

Notice\nthat, in Eq.

(4.20), setting n = 4 will yield the physical\nEinstein-Langevin equation. Due to the presence of the kernel Hnabcd (x, y), this equation will be\nusually non-local in the metric perturbation. In section 6 we will carry out an explicit evaluation\nof the physical Einstein-Langevin equation which will illustrate the procedure.\n4.3.1\n\nThe kernels for the vacuum state\n\nWhen the expectation values in the Einstein-Langevin equation are taken in a vacuum state |0i,\nsuch as, for instance, an \"in\" vacuum, we can be more explicit, since we can write the expectation\nvalues in terms of the Wightman and Feynman functions, defined as\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nG+\nn [g; x, y) \u2261 h0|\u03c6\u0302n [g; x)\u03c6\u0302n [g; y)|0i, iGF n [g; x, y) \u2261 h0|T \u03c6\u0302n [g; x)\u03c6\u0302n [g; y) |0i.\n\n(4.23)\n\nThese expressions for the kernels in the Einstein-Langevin equation will be very useful for explicit\ncalculations. To simplify the notation, we omit the functional dependence on the semiclassical\nmetric gab , which will be understood in all the expressions below.\n(x, y) are the real and imaginary\nFrom Eqs. (4.22), we see that the kernels Nnabcd (x, y) and HAabcd\nn\nparts, respectively, of the bi-tensor Fnabcd (x, y). From the expression\nn (3.4) we see that\no the stressab\nenergy operator T\u0302n can be written as a sum of terms of the form Ax \u03c6\u0302n (x), Bx \u03c6\u0302n (x) , where Ax\n\nand Bx are some differential operators. It then follows that we can express the bi-tensor Fnabcd (x, y)\nin terms of the Wightman function as\nb d +\na d +\nb c +\nFnabcd (x, y) = \u2207ax \u2207cy G+\nn (x, y)\u2207x \u2207y Gn (x, y) + \u2207x \u2207y Gn (x, y)\u2207x \u2207y Gn (x, y)\nd +\n+ 2Dxab (\u2207cy G+\nn (x, y)\u2207y Gn (x, y))\n\nb +\nab cd\n+2\n+2Dycd (\u2207ax G+\nn (x, y)\u2207x Gn (x, y)) + 2Dx Dy (Gn (x, y)),\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhere Dxab is the differential operator (3.5).

(4.8) as\nthe sum of HS (x, y) and HA (x, y). Now, when the points x and y are spacelike separated, \u03c6\u0302n (x) and\n\u03c6\u0302n (y) commute and, thus, G+\nn (x, y) = iGF n(x, y) = (1/2)h0| {\u03c6\u0302n (x), \u03c6\u0302n (y)} |0i, which is real. Hence,\nabcd (x, y) = 0.\nabcd\nfrom the above expressions, we have that HAabcd\nn (x, y) = HSn (x, y) = 0, and thus Hn\nThis fact is expected since, from the causality of the expectation value of the stress-energy operator\n[190], we know that the non-local dependence on the metric perturbation in the Einstein-Langevin\nequation, see Eq. (3.14), must be causal. See Ref. [4] for an alternative proof of the causal nature\nof the Einstein-Langevin equation.\n\n5\n\nNoise Kernel and Point-Separation\n\nIn this section we explore further the properties of the noise kernel and the stress energy bi-tensor.\nSimilar to what was done for the stress energy tensor it is desirable to relate the noise kernel defined\nat separated points to the Green function of a quantum field. We pointed out earlier [2] that field\nquantities defined at two separated points may possess important information which could be the\nstarting point for probes into possible extended structures of spacetime. Of more practical concern\nis how one can define a finite quantity at one point or in some small region around it from the noise\nkernel defined at two separated points. When we refer to, say, the fluctuations of energy density\nin ordinary (point-wise) quantum field theory, we are in actuality asking such a question. This is\nessential for addressing fundamental issues like\n\u2022 the validity of semiclassical gravity [115] \u2013 e.g., whether the fluctuations to mean ratio is a\ncorrect criterion [116, 117, 203, 204, 205, 113]\n\u2022 whether the fluctuations in the vacuum energy density which drives some models of inflationary cosmology violates the positive energy condition;\n\u2022 physical effects of black hole horizon fluctuations and Hawking radiation backreaction \u2013 to\nbegin with, is the fluctuations finite or infinite?\n\u2022 general relativity as a low energy effective theory in the geometro-hydrodynamic limit towards\na kinetic theory approach to quantum gravity [157, 2, 170].\nThus, for comparison with ordinary phenomena at low energy we need to find a reasonable\nprescription for obtaining a finite quantity of the noise kernel in the limit of ordinary (point-defined)\nquantum field theory. It is well-known that several regularization methods can work equally well\nfor the removal of ultraviolet divergences in the stress energy tensor of quantum fields in curved\nspacetime. Their mutual relations are known, and discrepancies explained. This formal structure of\nregularization schemes for quantum fields in curved spacetime should remain intact when applied to\nthe regularization of the noise kernel in general curved spacetimes; it is the meaning and relevance\nof regularization of the noise kernel which is more of a concern (see comments below). Specific\nconsiderations will of course enter for each method. But for the methods employed so far, such\nas zeta-function, point separation, dimensional, smeared-field, applied to simple cases (Casimir,\nEinstein, thermal fields) there is no new inconsistency or discrepancy.\n24\n\n\fRegularization schemes used in obtaining a finite expression for the stress energy tensor have\nbeen applied to the noise kernel. This includes the simple normal ordering [115, 253] and smeared\nfield operator [117] methods applied to the Minkowski and Casimir spaces, zeta-function [254, 255,\n256] for spacetimes with an Euclidean section, applied to the Casimir effect [202] and the Einstein\nUniverse [199], or the covariant point-separation methods applied to the Minkowski [117], hot flat\nspace and the Schwarzschild spacetime [8]. There are differences and deliberations on whether it is\nmeaningful to seek a point-wise expression for the noise kernel, and if so what is the correct way to\nproceed \u2013 e.g., regularization by a subtraction scheme or by integrating over a test-field. Intuitively\nthe smear field method [117] may better preserve the integrity of the noise kernel as it provides a\nsampling of the two point function rather than using a subtraction scheme which alters its innate\nproperties by forcing a nonlocal quantity into a local one. More investigation is needed to clarify\nthese points, which bear on important issues like the validity of semiclassical gravity. We shall set\na more modest goal here, to derive a general expression for the noise kernel for quantum fields in\nan arbitrary curved spacetime in terms of Green functions and leave the discussion of point-wise\nlimit to a later date. For this purpose the covariant point-separation method which highlights the\nbi-tensor features, when used not as a regularization scheme, is perhaps closest to the spirit of\nstochastic gravity.\nThe task of finding a general expression of the noise-kernel for quantum fields in curved spacetimes was carried out by Phillips and Hu in two papers using the \"modified\" point separation\nscheme [187, 257, 191]. Their first paper [7] begins with a discussion of the procedures for dealing\nwith the quantum stress tensor bi-operator at two separated points, and ends with a general expression of the noise kernel defined at separated points expressed as products of covariant derivatives\nup to the fourth order of the quantum field's Green function. (The stress tensor involves up to two\ncovariant derivatives.) This result holds for x 6= y without recourse to renormalization of the Green\nfunction, showing that Nabc\u2032 d\u2032 (x, y) is always finite for x 6= y (and off the light cone for massless\ntheories). In particular, for a massless conformally coupled free scalar field on a four dimensional\nmanifold they computed the trace of the noise kernel at both points and found this double trace\nvanishes identically. This implies that there is no stochastic correction to the trace anomaly for\nmassless conformal fields, in agreement with results arrived at in Refs. [102, 104, 6] (see also section\n3). In their second paper [8] a Gaussian approximation for the Green function (which is what limits\nthe accuracy of the results) is used to derive finite expressions for two specific classes of spacetimes,\nultrastatic spacetimes, such as the hot flat space, and the conformally- ultrastatic spacetimes, such\nas the Schwarzschild spacetime. Again, the validity of these results may depend on how we view\nthe relevance and meaning of regularization. We will only report the result of their first paper here.\n\n5.1\n\nPoint Separation\n\nThe point separation scheme introduced in the 60's by DeWitt [258] was brought to more popular\nuse in the 70's in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes [172, 188, 189] as a\nmeans for obtaining a finite quantum stress tensor. Since the stress-energy tensor is built from\nthe product of a pair of field operators evaluated at a single point, it is not well-defined. In this\nscheme, one introduces an artificial separation of the single point x to a pair of closely separated\npoints x and x\u2032 . The problematic terms involving field products such as \u03c6\u0302(x)2 becomes \u03c6\u0302(x)\u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ),\nwhose expectation value is well defined. If one is interested in the low energy behavior captured\nby the point-defined quantum field theory \u2013 as the effort in the 70's was directed \u2013 one takes the\n\n25\n\n\fcoincidence limit. Once the divergences present are identified, they may be removed (regularization)\nor moved (by renormalizing the coupling constants), to produce a well-defined, finite stress tensor\nat a single point.\nThus the first order of business is the construction of the stress tensor and then derive the\nsymmetric stress-energy tensor two point function, the noise kernel, in terms of the Wightman\nGreen function. In this section we will use the traditional notation for index tensors in the pointseparation context.\n5.1.1\n\nn-tensors and end-point expansions\n\nAn object like the Green function G(x, y) is an example of a bi-scalar: it transforms as scalar\nat both points x and y. We can also define a bi-tensor Ta1 ***an b\u20321 ***b\u2032m (x, y): upon a coordinate\ntransformation, this transforms as a rank n tensor at x and a rank m tensor at y. We will extend\nwhich has support at four points x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ,\nthis up to a quad-tensor Ta1 ***an1 b\u20321 ***b\u2032n c\u2032\u20321 ***c\u2032\u2032n d\u2032\u2032\u2032\n***d\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn4\n2\n3 1\ntransforming as rank n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 tensors at each of the four points. This also sets the notation\nwe will use: unprimed indices referring to the tangent space constructed above x, single primed\nindices to y, double primed to x\u2032 and triple primed to y \u2032 . For each point, there is the covariant\nderivative \u2207a at that point. Covariant derivatives at different points commute and the covariant\nderivative at, say, point x\u2032 , does not act on a bi-tensor defined at, say, x and y:\nTab\u2032 ;c;d\u2032 = Tab\u2032 ;d\u2032 ;c\n\nand\n\nTab\u2032 ;c\u2032\u2032 = 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nTo simplify notation, henceforth we will eliminate the semicolons after the first one for multiple\ncovariant derivatives at multiple points.\nHaving objects defined at different points, the coincident limit is defined as evaluation \"on the\ndiagonal\", in the sense of the spacetime support of the function or tensor, and the usual shorthand\n[G(x, y)] \u2261 G(x, x) is used. This extends to n-tensors as\nh\n\nTa1 ***an1 b\u20321 ***b\u2032n\n\n2\n\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\nc\u2032\u2032\n1 ***cn3 d1 ***dn4\n\ni\n\n= Ta1 ***an1 b1 ***bn2 c1 ***cn3 d1 ***dn4 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\ni.e., this becomes a rank (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 ) tensor at x. The multi-variable chain rule relates\ncovariant derivatives acting at different points, when we are interested in the coincident limit:\nh\n\nTa1 ***am b\u20321 ***b\u2032n\n\ni\n\n;c\n\ni\n\nh\n\nh\n\ni\n\n= Ta1 ***am b\u20321 ***b\u2032n ;c + Ta1 ***am b\u20321 ***b\u2032n ;c\u2032 .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThis result is referred to as Synge's theorem in this context; we follow Fulling's [33] discussion.\n\u2032\nThe bi-tensor of parallel transport ga b is defined such that when it acts on a vector vb\u2032 at y, it\nparallel transports the vector along the geodesics connecting x and y. This allows us to add vectors\nand tensors defined at different points. We cannot directly add a vector va at x and vector wa\u2032 at\na\nb\u2032\nb\u2032\ny.\ni by using ga , we can construct the sum v + ga wb\u2032 . We will also need the obvious property\nh But\n\u2032\nga b = ga b .\nThe main bi-scalar we need is the world function \u03c3(x, y). This is defined as a half of the square\nof the geodesic distance between the points x and y. It satisfies the equation\n1\n\u03c3 = \u03c3 ;p \u03c3;p\n2\n26\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fOften in the literature, a covariant derivative is implied when the world function appears with\n\u2032\nindices: \u03c3 a \u2261 \u03c3 ;a , i.e.taking the covariant derivative at x, while \u03c3 a means the covariant derivative\nat y. This is done since the vector \u2212\u03c3 a is the tangent vector to the geodesic with length equal\nthe distance between x and y. As \u03c3 a records information about distance and direction for the two\npoints this makes it ideal for constructing a series expansion of a bi-scalar. The end point expansion\nof a bi-scalar S(x, y) is of the form\np q (2)\np q r (3)\np q r s (4)\nS(x, y) = A(0) + \u03c3 p A(1)\np + \u03c3 \u03c3 Apq + \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 Apqr + \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 Apqrs + * * *\n\n(5.5)\n\n(n)\n\nwhere, following our convention, the expansion tensors Aa1 ***an with unprimed indices have support\nat x and hence the name end point expansion. Only the symmetric part of these tensors contribute\nto the expansion. For the purposes of multiplying series expansions it is convenient to separate the\ndistance \u221a\ndependence from the direction dependence. This is done by introducing the unit vector\na\na\np = \u03c3 / 2\u03c3. Then the series expansion can be written\n1\n\n3\n\nS(x, y) = A(0) + \u03c3 2 A(1) + \u03c3A(2) + \u03c3 2 A(3) + \u03c3 2 A(4) + * * *\n\n(5.6)\n\n(n)\n\nThe expansion scalars are related, via A(n) = 2n/2 Ap1 ***pn pp1 * * * ppn , to the expansion tensors.\nThe last \u0001object we need is the VanVleck-Morette determinant D(x, y), defined as D(x, y) \u2261\n\u2212 det \u2212\u03c3;ab\u2032 . The related bi-scalar\n1/2\n\n\u2206\nsatisfies the equation\nh\n\n=\n\nD(x, y)\np\ng(x)g(y)\n\n!1\n\n2\n\n\u22061/2 (4 \u2212 \u03c3;p p ) \u2212 2\u22061/2 ;p \u03c3 ;p = 0\n\n(5.7)\n\n(5.8)\n\ni\n\nwith the boundary condition \u22061/2 = 1.\nFurther details on these objects and discussions of the definitions and properties are contained\nin [188, 189] and [259]. There it is shown how the defining equations for \u03c3 and \u22061/2 are used to\ndetermine the coincident limit expression for the various covariant derivatives of the world function\n([\u03c3;a ], [\u03c3;ab ], etc.) and how the defining differential equation for \u22061/2 can be used to determine\n(n)\nthe series expansion of \u22061/2 . We show how the expansion tensors Aa1 ***an are determined in terms\nof the coincident limits of covariant derivatives of the bi-scalar S(x, y). (Ref. [259] details how\npoint separation can be implemented on the computer to provide easy access to a wider range of\napplications involving higher derivatives of the curvature tensors.)\n\n5.2\n\nStress Energy Bi-Tensor Operator and Noise Kernel\n\nEven though we believe that the point-separated results are more basic in the sense that it reflects\na deeper structure of the quantum theory of spacetime, we will nevertheless start with quantities\ndefined at one point because they are what enter in conventional quantum field theory. We will use\npoint separation to introduce the bi-quantities. The key issue here is thus the distinction between\npoint-defined (pt) and point-separated (bi) quantities.\nFor a free classical scalar field \u03c6 with the action Sm [g, \u03c6] defined in Eq. (3.1), the classical\nstress-energy tensor is\n\u0012\n\nTab = (1 \u2212 2 \u03be) \u03c6;a \u03c6;b + 2 \u03be \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n27\n\n\u03c6;p \u03c6;p gab + 2\u03be \u03c6 (\u03c6;p p \u2212 \u03c6;ab g ab )\n\n\f+\u03c62 \u03be\n\n1\n1\nRab \u2212 R gab \u2212 m2 \u03c62 g ab ,\n2\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the tensor of Eq. (3.3) but written in a slightly different form for convenience.\nWhen we make the transition to quantum field theory, we promote the field \u03c6(x) to a field operator\n\u03c6\u0302(x). The fundamental problem of defining a quantum operator for the stress tensor is immediately\nvisible: the field operator appears quadratically. Since \u03c6\u0302(x) is an operator-valued distribution,\nproducts at a single point are not well-defined. But if the product is point separated (\u03c6\u03022 (x) \u2192\n\u03c6\u0302(x)\u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 )), they are finite and well-defined.\nLet us first seek a point-separated extension of these classical quantities and then consider\nthe quantum field operators. Point separation is symmetrically extended to products of covariant\nderivatives of the field according to\n(\u03c6;a ) (\u03c6;b ) \u2192\n\u03c6 (\u03c6;ab ) \u2192\n\n\u0011\n\u2032\n1 \u0010 p\u2032\nga \u2207p\u2032 \u2207b + gb p \u2207a \u2207p\u2032 \u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 ),\n2\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2207a \u2207b + ga p gb q \u2207p\u2032 \u2207q\u2032 \u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 ).\n2\n\u2032\n\nThe bi-vector of parallel displacement ga a (x, x\u2032 ) is included so that we may have objects that are\nrank 2 tensors at x and scalars at x\u2032 .\nTo carry out point separation on (5.9), we first define the differential operator\nTab\n\n\u0010 \u2032\n\u0011\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\n(1 \u2212 2\u03be) ga a \u2207a\u2032 \u2207b + gb b \u2207a \u2207b\u2032 + 2\u03be \u2212\ngab g cd \u2207c \u2207d\u2032\n2 \u0010\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\u03be \u2207a \u2207b + ga a gb b \u2207a\u2032 \u2207b\u2032 + \u03begab \u2207c \u2207c + \u2207c\u2032 \u2207c\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n+\u03be Rab \u2212 gab R \u2212 m2 gab\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.10)\n\nfrom which we obtain the classical stress tensor as\nTab (x) = lim\nTab \u03c6(x)\u03c6(x\u2032 ).\n\u2032\nx \u2192x\n\n(5.11)\n\nThat the classical tensor field no longer appears as a product of scalar fields at a single point allows\na smooth transition to the quantum tensor field. From the viewpoint of the stress tensor, the\nseparation of points is an artificial construct so when promoting the classical field to a quantum one,\nneither point should be favored. The product of field configurations is taken to be the symmetrized\noperator product, denoted by curly brackets:\n\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) \u2192\n\no\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1n\n\u03c6\u0302(x), \u03c6\u0302(y) =\n\u03c6\u0302(x)\u03c6\u0302(y) + \u03c6\u0302(y)\u03c6\u0302(x)\n2\n2\n\n(5.12)\n\nWith this, the point separated stress energy tensor operator is defined as\no\nn\n1\nT\u0302ab (x, x\u2032 ) \u2261 Tab \u03c6\u0302(x), \u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ) .\n2\n\n(5.13)\n\nWhile the classical stress tensor was defined at the coincidence limit x\u2032 \u2192 x, we cannot attach any\nphysical meaning to the quantum stress tensor at one point until the issue of regularization is dealt\nwith, which will happen in the next section. For now, we will maintain point separation so as to\nhave a mathematically meaningful operator.\n28\n\n\fThe expectation value of the point-separated stress tensor can now be taken. This amounts\nto replacing the field operators by their expectation value, which is given by the Hadamard (or\nSchwinger) function\no\nn\n(5.14)\nG(1) (x, x\u2032 ) = h \u03c6\u0302(x), \u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ) i.\nand the point-separated stress tensor is defined as\nhT\u0302ab (x, x\u2032 )i =\n\n1\nTab G(1) (x, x\u2032 )\n2\n\n(5.15)\n\nwhere, since Tab is a differential operator, it can be taken \"outside\" the expectation value.

(3.11), which is the symmetrized\nproduct of the (mean subtracted) stress tensor operator:\nn\n\no\n\n8Nab,c\u2032 d\u2032 (x, y) = h T\u0302ab (x) \u2212 hT\u0302ab (x)i, T\u0302c\u2032 d\u2032 (y) \u2212 hT\u0302c\u2032 d\u2032 (y)i i\no\n\nn\n\n= h T\u0302ab (x), T\u0302c\u2032 d\u2032 (y) i \u2212 2hT\u0302ab (x)ihT\u0302c\u2032 d\u2032 (y)i\n\n(5.17)\n\nSince T\u0302ab (x) defined at one point can be ill-behaved as it is generally divergent, one can question\nthe soundness of these quantities. But as will be shown later, the noise kernel is finite for y 6= x. All\nfield operator products present in the first expectation value that could be divergent are canceled\nby similar products in the second term. We will replace each of the stress tensor operators in the\nabove expression for the noise kernel by their point separated versions, effectively separating the two\npoints (x, y) into the four points (x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 ). This will allow us to express the noise kernel in terms\nof a pair of differential operators acting on a combination of four and two point functions. Wick's\ntheorem will allow the four point functions to be re-expressed in terms of two point functions. From\nthis we see that all possible divergences for y 6= x will cancel. When the coincidence limit is taken\ndivergences do occur. The above procedure will allow us to isolate the divergences and obtain a\nfinite result.\nTaking the point-separated quantities as more basic, one should replace each of the stress tensor\noperators in the above with the corresponding point separated version (5.13), with Tab acting at x\nand x\u2032 and Tc\u2032 d\u2032 acting at y and y \u2032 . In this framework the noise kernel is defined as\nlim\nTab Tc\u2032 d\u2032 G(x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 )\n8Nab,c\u2032 d\u2032 (x, y) = lim\n\u2032\n\u2032\nx \u2192x y \u2192y\n\n29\n\n(5.18)\n\n\fwhere the four point function is\nG(x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 ) =\n\noo\no n\n1 h nn\nh \u03c6\u0302(x), \u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ) , \u03c6\u0302(y), \u03c6\u0302(y \u2032 ) i\n4\n\no i\n\n(5.19)\n\nh\u03c6\u0302(x) \u03c6\u0302(y) \u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ) \u03c6\u0302(y \u2032 )i = Gxy\u2032 Gyx\u2032 + Gxx\u2032 Gyy\u2032 + Gxy Gx\u2032 y\u2032\n\n(5.20)\n\nn\n\no n\n\n\u22122 h \u03c6\u0302(x), \u03c6\u0302(x\u2032 ) ih \u03c6\u0302(y), \u03c6\u0302(y \u2032 ) i .\n\nWe assume the pairs (x, x\u2032 ) and (y, y \u2032 ) are each within their respective Riemann normal coordinate\nneighborhoods so as to avoid problems that possible geodesic caustics might be present. When we\nlater turn our attention to computing the limit y \u2192 x, after issues of regularization are addressed, we\nwill want to assume all four points are within the same Riemann normal coordinate neighborhood.\nWick's theorem, for the case of free fields which we are considering, gives the simple product\nfour point function in terms of a sum of products of Wightman functions (we use the shorthand\nnotation Gxy \u2261 G+ (x, y) = h\u03c6\u0302(x) \u03c6\u0302(y)i):\n\nExpanding out the anti-commutators in (5.19) and applying Wick's theorem, the four point function\nbecomes\n(5.21)\nG(x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 ) = Gxy\u2032 Gx\u2032 y + Gxy Gx\u2032 y\u2032 + Gyx\u2032 Gy\u2032 x + Gyx Gy\u2032 x\u2032 .\nWe can now easily see that the noise kernel defined via this function is indeed well defined for the\nlimit (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2192 (x, y):\n\u0010\n\u0011\nG(x, x, y, y) = 2 G2xy + G2yx .\n(5.22)\nFrom this we can see that the noise kernel is also well defined for y 6= x; any divergence present\nin the first expectation value of (5.19) have been cancelled by those present in the pair of Green\nfunctions in the second term, in agreement with the results of section 3.\n5.2.2\n\nExplicit Form of the Noise Kernel\n\nWe will let the points separated for a while so we can keep track of which covariant derivative\nacts on which arguments of which Wightman function.

First we note, for x and y time-like\nseparated, the above split of the noise kernel allows us to express it in terms of the Feynman (time\nordered) Green function GF (x, y) and the Dyson (anti-time ordered) Green function GD (x, y):\nNabc\u2032 d\u2032 (x, y) = Nabc\u2032 d\u2032 [GF (x, y)] + Nabc\u2032 d\u2032 [GD (x, y)] .\n\n(5.27)\n\nThis can be connected with the zeta function approach to this problem [199] as follows: Recall\nwhen the quantum stress tensor fluctuations determined in the Euclidean section is analytically\ncontinued back to Lorentzian signature (\u03c4 \u2192 it), the time ordered product results. On the other\nhand, if the continuation is \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212it, the anti-time ordered product results.

When\nthe trace of the stress tensor T = g ab Tab is evaluated for a field configuration that satisties the\nfield equation (3.2) the trace is seen to vanish for massless conformally coupled fields. When this\nanalysis is carried over to the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress tensor, the trace\nno longer vanishes. Wald [191] showed this was due to the failure of the renormalized Hadamard\nfunction Gren (x, x\u2032 ) to be symmetric in x and x\u2032 , implying it does not necessarily satisfy the field\nequation (3.2) in the variable x\u2032 . The definition of Gren (x, x\u2032 ) in the context of point separation\nwill come next.)\nWith this in mind, we can now determine the noise associated with the trace. Taking the trace\nat both points x and y of the noise kernel functional (5.27):\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nNabc\u2032 d\u2032 [G] \u0013\nN [G] = gab gc d \u0014\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u2032\n1\n1\n= \u22123 G \u03be m2 + \u03beR G;p\u2032 p + m2 + \u03beR\u2032 G;p p\n2\n2\ni\n9 \u03be2 h\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+\nG;p\u2032 p G;p p + G G;p p p\u2032 p\n2\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nm2 + \u03beR\u2032 G2\n+ m2 + \u03beR\n2\u0013\u0014 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+3 \u2212\u03be 3 \u2212\u03be G;p\u2032 p G; p p \u22123\u03be G;p G;p\u2032 pp +G;p\u2032 G;p pp\n6 \u0012\n6\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u2032\n;p\n2 1\np\u2032\n2 1\n+ m + \u03beR G;p\u2032 G; + m + \u03beR G;p G .\n2\n2\n\n(5.33)\n\nFor the massless conformal case, this reduces to\nN [G] =\n\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003o\n1 n\nRR\u2032 G2 \u2212 6G R\u2737\u2032 + R\u2032 \u2737 G + 18 (\u2737G) \u2737\u2032 G + \u2737\u2032 \u2737G ,\n144\n\n(5.34)\n\nwhich holds for any function G(x, y). For G being the Green function, it satisfies the field equation\n(3.2):\n\u2737G = (m2 + \u03beR)G.\n(5.35)\n32\n\n\fWe will only assume the Green function satisfies the field equation in its first variable. Using\nthe fact \u2737\u2032 R = 0 (because the covariant derivatives act at a different point than at which R is\nsupported), it follows that\n\u2737\u2032 \u2737G = (m2 + \u03beR)\u2737\u2032 G.\n(5.36)\nWith these results, the noise kernel trace becomes\n1\n1\nN [G] =\n\u2212\u03be \u03be\nm2 (1 \u2212 3 \u03be) + 3 R\n2\n6\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7 G2 2 m2 + R\u2032 \u03be + (1 \u2212 6 \u03be) G;p\u2032 G; p \u2212 6 G \u03be G;p\u2032 p\n\u0013h \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\n1 1\n\u2032\n+\n\u2212 \u03be 3 2 m2 + R\u2032 \u03be G;p G;p \u2212 18 \u03be G;p G;p\u2032 pp\n2 6\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n1\np\u2032 p\n\u2212 \u03be G;p\u2032 p G;\n,\n+18\n6\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0015\n\n(5.37)\n\nwhich vanishes for the massless conformal case. We have thus shown, based solely on the definition\nof the point separated noise kernel, there is no noise associated with the trace anomaly. This\nresult obtained in Ref. [8] is completely general since it is assumed that the Green function is only\nsatisfying the field equations in its first variable; an alternative proof of this result was given in Ref.\n[6]. This condition holds not just for the classical field case, but also for the regularized quantum\ncase, where one does not expect the Green function to satisfy the field equation in both variables.\nOne can see this result from the simple observation used in section 3: since the trace anomaly\nis known to be locally determined and quantum state independent, whereas the noise present in\nthe quantum field is non-local, it is hard to find a noise associated with it. This general result\nis in agreement with previous findings [102, 99, 104], derived from the Feynman-Vernon influence\nfunctional formalism [12, 13] for some particular cases.\n\n6\n\nMetric fluctuations in Minkowski spacetime\n\nAlthough the Minkowski vacuum is an eigenstate of the total four-momentum operator of a field in\nMinkowski spacetime, it is not an eigenstate of the stress-energy operator. Hence, even for those\nsolutions of semiclassical gravity such as the Minkowski metric, for which the expectation value of\nthe stress-energy operator can always be chosen to be zero, the fluctuations of this operator are\nnon-vanishing. This fact leads to consider the stochastic metric perturbations induced by these\nfluctuations.\nHere we derive the Einstein-Langevin equation for the metric perturbations in a Minkowski\nbackground. We solve this equation for the linearized Einstein tensor and compute the associated\ntwo-point correlation functions, as well as, the two-point correlation functions for the metric perturbations. Even though, in this case, we expect to have negligibly small values for these correlation\nfunctions for points separated by lengths larger than the Planck length, there are several reasons\nwhy it is worth carrying out this calculation.\nOn the one hand, these are the first back-reaction solutions of the full Einstein-Langevin equation. There are analogous solutions to a \"reduced\" version of this equation inspired in a \"minisuperspace\" model [105, 106], and there is also a previous attempt to obtain a solution to the\nEinstein-Langevin equation in Ref. [104], but, there, the non-local terms in the Einstein-Langevin\nequation were neglected.\n33\n\n\fOn the other hand, the results of this calculation, which confirm our expectations that gravitational fluctuations are negligible at length scales larger than the Planck length, but also predict that\nthe fluctuations are strongly suppressed on small scales, can be considered a first test of stochastic\nsemiclassical gravity. These results reveal also an important connection between stochastic gravity\nand the large N expansion of quantum gravity. In addition, they are used in 6.5 to study the stability of the Minkowski metric as a solution of semiclassical gravity, which constitutes an application\nof the validity criterion introduced in section 3.3. This calculation requires also a discussion of the\nproblems posed by the so called runaway solutions, which arise in the back-reaction equations of\nsemiclassical and stochastic gravity, and some of the methods to deal with them. As a result we\nconclude that Minkowski spacetime is a stable and valid solution of semiclassical gravity.\nWe advise the reader that his section is rather technical since it deals with an explicit non trivial\nback-reaction computation in stochastic gravity. We tried to make it reasonable self-contained and\ndetailed, however a more detailed exposition can be found in Ref. [109].\n\n6.1\n\nPerturbations around Minkowski spacetime\n\nThe Minkowski metric \u03b7ab , in a manifold M which is topologically IR4 , and the usual Minkowski\nvacuum, denoted as |0i, are the class of simplest solutions to the semiclassical Einstein equation\n(3.7), the so called trivial solutions of semiclassical gravity [229]. They constitute the ground state\nof semiclassical gravity. In fact, we can always choose a renormalization scheme in which the\nrenormalized expectation value h0| T\u0302Rab [\u03b7]|0i = 0. Thus, Minkowski spacetime (IR4 , \u03b7ab ) and the\nvacuum state |0i are a solution to the semiclassical Einstein equation with renormalized cosmological\nconstant \u039b = 0. The fact that the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy\noperator in Minkowski spacetime should vanish was originally proposed by Wald [190] and it may\nbe understood as a renormalization convention [33, 35]. Note that other possible solutions of\nsemiclassical gravity with zero vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor are the exact\ngravitational plane waves, since they are known to be vacuum solutions of Einstein equations which\ninduce neither particle creation nor vacuum polarization [262, 263, 264].\nAs we have already mentioned the vacuum |0i is an eigenstate of the total four-momentum\nR [\u03b7]. Hence, even in the Minkowski\noperator in Minkowski spacetime, but not an eigenstate of T\u0302ab\nbackground, there are quantum fluctuations in the stress-energy tensor and, as a result, the noise\nkernel does not vanish. This fact leads to consider the stochastic corrections to this class of trivial\nsolutions of semiclassical gravity. Since, in this case, the Wightman and Feynman functions (4.23),\ntheir values in the two-point coincidence limit, and the products of derivatives of two of such\nfunctions appearing in expressions (4.24) and (4.25) are known in dimensional regularization, we\ncan compute the Einstein-Langevin equation using the methods outlined in sections 3 and 4.\nTo perform explicit calculations it is convenient to work in a global inertial coordinate system\n\u03bc\n{x } and in the associated basis, in which the components of the flat metric are simply \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd =\ndiag(\u22121, 1, . . . , 1). In Minkowski spacetime, the components of the classical stress-energy tensor\n(3.3) reduce to\nT \u03bc\u03bd [\u03b7, \u03c6] = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6 \u2212\n\n1\n1 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c1\n\u03b7 \u2202 \u03c6\u2202\u03c1 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd m2 \u03c62 + \u03be (\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2737 \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd ) \u03c62 ,\n2\n2\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere \u2737 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc , and the formal expression for the components of the corresponding \"operator\" in\n\n34\n\n\fdimensional regularization, see Eq. (3.4), is\nT\u0302n\u03bc\u03bd [\u03b7] =\n\n1 \u03bc\n{\u2202 \u03c6\u0302n , \u2202 \u03bd \u03c6\u0302n } + D \u03bc\u03bd \u03c6\u03022n ,\n2\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere D \u03bc\u03bd is the differential operator (3.5), with g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , R\u03bc\u03bd = 0, and \u2207\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc . The field\n\u03c6\u0302n (x) is the field operator in the Heisenberg representation in a n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime,\nwhich satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation (3.2). We use here a stress-energy tensor which differs\nfrom the canonical one, which corresponds to \u03be = 0, both tensors, however, define the same total\nmomentum.\nThe Wightman and Feynman functions (4.23) when g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , are well known:\n+\nG+\nn (x, y) = i\u2206n (x \u2212 y),\n\nGF n(x, y) = \u2206F n(x \u2212 y),\n\n(6.3)\n\nwith\ndn k ikx\ne \u03b4(k2 + m2 ) \u03b8(k0 ),\n(2\u03c0)n\nZ\ndn k\neikx\n\u2206F n(x) = \u2212\n,\n\u01eb \u2192 0+ ,\n(2\u03c0)n k2 + m2 \u2212 i\u01eb\n\n\u2206+\nn (x)\n\n= \u22122\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere k2 \u2261 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd k\u03bc k\u03bd and kx \u2261 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd k\u03bc x\u03bd . Note that the derivatives of these functions satisfy\n+\ny +\n+\n\u2202\u03bcx \u2206+\nn (x \u2212 y) = \u2202\u03bc \u2206n (x \u2212 y) and \u2202\u03bc \u2206n (x \u2212 y) = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u2206n (x \u2212 y), and similarly for the Feynman\npropagator \u2206F n(x \u2212 y).\nTo write down the semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7) in n-dimensions for this case, we need\nto compute the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy operator components (6.2). Since,\nfrom (6.3), we have that h0|\u03c6\u03022n (x)|0i = i\u2206F n(0) = i\u2206+\nn (0), which is a constant (independent of x),\nwe have simply\nh0|T\u0302n\u03bc\u03bd [\u03b7]|0i\n\n= \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\ndn k\n=\nn\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) k + m \u2212 i\u01eb\n2\n\nm2\n4\u03c0\n\n!n/2 \u0012\n\n\u0393 \u2212\n\nn\n,\n2\n\u0013\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere the integrals in dimensional regularization have been computed in the standard way (see Ref.\n[109]) and where \u0393(z) is the Euler's gamma function. The semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7) in\nn-dimensions before renormalization reduces now to\n\u039bB \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b7 = \u03bc\u2212(n\u22124) h0|T\u0302n\u03bc\u03bd [\u03b7]|0i.\n8\u03c0GB\n\n(6.6)\n\nThis equation, thus, simply sets the value of the bare coupling constant \u039bB /GB . Note, from\n(6.5), that in order to have h0| T\u0302R\u03bc\u03bd |0i[\u03b7] = 0, the renormalized and regularized stress-energy tensor\n\"operator\" for a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, see Eq.

In the case of a massless scalar field, m2 = 0, one simply has\n\u039bB /GB = \u039b/G. Introducing this renormalized coupling constant into Eq. (6.6), we can take the\nlimit n \u2192 4. We find that, for (IR4 , \u03b7ab , |0i) to satisfy the semiclassical Einstein equation, we must\ntake \u039b = 0.\nWe can now write down the Einstein-Langevin equations for the components h\u03bc\u03bd of the stochastic metric perturbation in dimensional regularization. In our case, using h0|\u03c6\u03022n (x)|0i = i\u2206F n(0) and\nthe explicit expression of Eq.

The bi-tensor F \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 can be expressed in terms of the\nWightman function in four spacetime dimensions, according to (4.24).

In order to\n39\n\n\fcarry out such a procedure, it is convenient to distinguish between massive and massless scalar\nfields. The details of the calculation can be found in Ref.

The renormalized coupling\nconstants 1/G, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are easily computed as it was done in Eq. (6.8). Substituting their\nexpressions into Eq.

We note that in the massless limit, the\nNewtonian gravitational constant is not renormalized and, in the conformal coupling case, \u2206\u03be = 0,\nwe have that \u03b2B = \u03b2.

The Fourier transforms (6.32) and (6.33)\ncan actually be computed and, thus, in this case we have explicit expressions for the kernels in\nposition space; see, for instance, Refs. [265, 266, 110].\nFinally, the Einstein-Langevin equation for the physical stochastic perturbations h\u03bc\u03bd can be\nwritten in both cases, for m 6= 0 and for m = 0, as\n\u0001\n1\nG(1) \u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2212 2 \u1fb1A(1) \u03bc\u03bd (x) + \u03b2\u0304B (1) \u03bc\u03bd (x)\n8\u03c0G Z\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n+\nd4 y HA (x\u2212y)A(1) \u03bc\u03bd (y) + HB (x\u2212y)B (1) \u03bc\u03bd (y) = \u03be \u03bc\u03bd (x),\n4\n\n(6.34)\n\nwhere in terms of the renormalized constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 the new constants are \u1fb1 = \u03b1 + (3600\u03c0 2 )\u22121\nand \u03b2\u0304 = \u03b2 \u2212 (1/12 \u2212 5\u2206\u03be)(2880\u03c0 2 )\u22121 . The kernels HA (x) and HB (x) are given by Eqs. (6.28)\nwhen m 6= 0, and HA (x) = H(x; \u03bc2 ), HB (x) = 60\u2206\u03be 2 H(x; \u03bc2 ) when m = 0. In the massless\ncase, we can use the arbitrariness of the mass scale \u03bc to eliminate one of the parameters \u1fb1 or \u03b2\u0304.\nThe components of the Gaussian stochastic source \u03be \u03bc\u03bd have zero mean value and their two-point\ncorrelation functions are given by h\u03be \u03bc\u03bd (x)\u03be \u03b1\u03b2 (y)is = N \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y), where the noise kernel is given\nin (6.18), which in the massless case reduces to (6.31).\nIt is interesting to consider the massless conformally coupled scalar field, i.e., the case \u2206\u03be = 0, of\nparticular interest because of its similarities with the electromagnetic field, and also because of its\ninterest in cosmology: massive fields become conformally invariant when their masses are negligible\ncompared to the spacetime curvature. We have already mentioned that for a conformally coupled,\nfield, the stochastic source tensor must be traceless (up to first order in perturbation theory around\nsemiclassical gravity), in the sense that the stochastic variable \u03be\u03bc\u03bc \u2261 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u03be \u03bc\u03bd behaves deterministically\nas a vanishing scalar field. This can be directly checked by noticing, from Eqs. (6.18) and (6.31),\nthat, when \u2206\u03be = 0, one has h\u03be\u03bc\u03bc (x)\u03be \u03b1\u03b2 (y)is = 0, since F\u03bc\u03bc = 3\u2737 and F \u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bc\u03b2 = \u2737F \u03b1\u03b2 . The EinsteinLangevin equations for this particular case (and generalized to a spatially flat Robertson-Walker\nbackground) were first obtained in Ref. [104], where the coupling constant \u03b2 was fixed to be zero.\nSee also Ref. [4] for a discussion of this result and its connection to the problem of structure\nformation in the trace anomaly driven inflation [135, 136, 137].\nNote that the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a scalar field can be\nobtained by comparing Eq. (6.34) with the Einstein-Langevin equation (3.14), its explicit expression\nis given in Ref. [109]. The results agree with the general form found by Horowitz [110, 111] using an\naxiomatic approach and coincides with that given in Ref. [229]. The particular cases of conformal\ncoupling, \u2206\u03be = 0, and minimal coupling, \u2206\u03be = \u22121/6, are also in agreement with the results for this\ncases given in Refs. [110, 111, 267, 96, 24], modulo local terms proportional to A(1) \u03bc\u03bd and B (1) \u03bc\u03bd\ndue to different choices of the renormalization scheme. For the case of a massive minimally coupled\nscalar field, \u2206\u03be = \u22121/6, our result is equivalent to that of Ref. [268].\n\n6.4\n\nCorrelation functions for gravitational perturbations\n\nHere we solve the Einstein-Langevin equations (6.34) for the components G(1) \u03bc\u03bd of the linearized\nEinstein tensor. Then we use these solutions to compute the corresponding two-point correlation\nfunctions, which give a measure of the gravitational fluctuations predicted by the stochastic semiclassical theory of gravity in the present case. Since the linearized Einstein tensor is invariant\n41\n\n\funder gauge transformations of the metric perturbations, these two-point correlation functions are\nalso gauge invariant. Once we have computed the two-point correlation functions for the linearized\nEinstein tensor, we find the solutions for the metric perturbations and compute the associated\ntwo-point correlation functions. The procedure used to solve the Einstein-Langevin equation is\nsimilar to the one used by Horowitz [110], see also Ref. [229], to analyze the stability of Minkowski\nspacetime in semiclassical gravity.\nWe first note that the tensors A(1) \u03bc\u03bd and B (1) \u03bc\u03bd can be written in terms of G(1) \u03bc\u03bd as\n2\nB (1) \u03bc\u03bd = 2F \u03bc\u03bd G(1) \u03b1\u03b1 ,\n(6.35)\nA(1) \u03bc\u03bd = (F \u03bc\u03bd G(1) \u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 F\u03b1\u03b1 G(1) \u03bc\u03bd ),\n3\nwhere we have used that 3\u2737 = F\u03b1\u03b1 . Therefore, the Einstein-Langevin equation (6.34) can be seen as\na linear integro-differential stochastic equation for the components G(1) \u03bc\u03bd . In order toR find solutions\nto Eq. (6.34), it is convenient to Fourier transform.

If we use the dimensionless\ntensor P \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 introduced in Eq.

One can see that the imaginary part of\nthe graviton propagator leads, in fact, to Eq. (6.62). In Ref. [211] it is shown that, in fact, the\ntwo-point correlation functions for the metric perturbations derived from the Einstein-Langevin\nequation are equivalent to the symmetrized quantum two-point correlation functions for the metric\nfluctuations in the large N expansion of quantum gravity interacting with N matter fields.\nThe main results of this section are the correlation functions (6.53) and (6.59). In the case of\na conformal field, the correlation functions of the linearized Einstein tensor have been explicitly\nestimated. From the exponential factors e\u2212|y|/lp in these results for scales near the Planck length,\nwe see that the correlation functions of the linearized Einstein tensor have the Planck length as\nthe correlation length. A similar behavior is found for the correlation functions of the metric\nperturbations. Since these fluctuations are induced by the matter fluctuations we infer that the\neffect of the matter fields is to suppress the fluctuations of the metric at very small scales. On the\nother hand, at scales much larger than the Planck length the induced metric fluctuations are small\ncompared with the free Rgraviton propagator which goes like lp2 /|y|2 , since the action for the free\ngraviton goes like Sh \u223c d4 x lp\u22122 h\u2737h\nFor background solutions of semiclassical gravity with other scales present apart from the Planck\nscales (for instance, for matter fields in a thermal state), stress-energy fluctuations may be important at larger scales. For such backgrounds, stochastic semiclassical gravity might predict correlation functions with characteristic correlation lengths larger than the Planck scales. It seems quite\nplausible, nevertheless, that these correlation functions would remain non-analytic in their characteristic correlation lengths. This would imply that these correlation functions could not be obtained\nfrom a calculation involving a perturbative expansion in the characteristic correlation lengths. In\nparticular, if these correlation lengths are proportional to the Planck constant h\u0304, the gravitational\ncorrelation functions could not be obtained from an expansion in h\u0304. Hence, stochastic semiclassical\ngravity might predict a behavior for gravitational correlation functions different from that of the\nanalogous functions in perturbative quantum gravity [241, 242, 243, 244]. This is not necessarily\ninconsistent with having neglected action terms of higher order in h\u0304 when considering semiclassical\ngravity as an effective theory [229]. It is, in fact, consistent with the closed connection of stochastic\ngravity with the large N expansion of quantum gravity interacting with N matter fields.\n\n6.5\n\nStability of Minkowski spacetime\n\nIn this section we apply the validity criterion for semiclassical gravity introduced in section 3.3 to flat\nspacetime. The Minkowski metric is a particularly simple and interesting solution of semiclassical\ngravity. In fact, as we have seen in section 6.1, when the quantum fields are in the Minkowski\nR [\u03b7]i = 0\nvacuum state one may take the renormalized expectation value of the stress tensor as hT\u0302ab\n47\n\n\f(this is equivalent to assuming that the cosmological constant is zero), then the Minkowski metric\n\u03b7ab is a solution of the semiclassical Einstein equation (3.7). Thus, we can look for the stability of\nMinkowski spacetime against quantum matter fields. According to the criteria we have established\nwe have to look for the behavior of the two-point quantum correlations for the metric perturbations\nhab (x) over the Minkowski background which are given by Eqs. (3.15) and (3.16). As we have\nemphasized before these metric fluctuations separate in two parts: the first term on the right hand\nside of Eq. (3.16) which corresponds to the intrinsic metric fluctuations, and the second term which\ncorresponds to the induced metric fluctuations.\n6.5.1\n\nIntrinsic metric fluctuations\n\nLet us first consider the intrinsic metric fluctuations,\nhhab (x)hcd (y)iint = hh0ab (x)h0cd (y)is ,\n\n(6.63)\n\nwhere h0ab are the homogeneous solutions of the Einstein-Langevin equation (3.14), or equivalently\nthe linearly perturbed semiclassical equation, and where the statistical average is taken with respect\nto the Wigner distribution that describes the initial quantum state of the metric perturbations.\nSince these solutions are described by the linearized semiclassical equation around flat spacetime\nwe can make use of the results derived in Refs. [110, 229, 113, 205]. The solutions for the case of a\nmassless scalar field were first discussed in Ref. [110] and an exhaustive description can be found\nin Appendix A of Ref. [229]. It is convenient to decompose the perturbation around Minkowski\nspacetime into scalar, vectorial and tensorial parts, as\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nhab = \u03c6\u0304 \u03b7ab + \u2207(a \u2207b) \u2212 \u03b7ab \u2207c \u2207c \u03c8 + 2\u2207(a vb) + hTT\nab ,\n\n(6.64)\n\na\nwhere v a is a transverse vector and hTT\nab is a transverse and traceless symmetric tensor, i.e., \u2207a v =\na\nTT\nTT\na\na\n0, \u2207 hab = 0 and (h )a = 0. A vector field \u03b6 characterizes the gauge freedom due to infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphisms hab \u2192 hab +\u2207a \u03b6b +\u2207b \u03b6a . We may use this freedom to choose a gauge, a convenient\nelection is the so called Lorentz or harmonic gauge defined as\n\n\u2207\n\na\n\n1\nhab \u2212 \u03b7ab hcc = 0.\n2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(6.65)\n\nWhen this gauge is imposed we have the following conditions on the metric perturbations \u2207a \u2207a v b =\n0 and \u2207b \u03c6\u0304 = 0, which implies \u03c6\u0304 = const. A remaining gauge freedom compatible with the Lorentz\ngauge is still possible provided the vector field \u03b6 a satisfies the condition \u2207a \u2207a \u03b6 b = 0. One can\neasily see [118] that the vectorial and scalar part \u03c6\u0304 can be eliminated, as well as the contribution of\nthe scalar part \u03c8 which corresponds to Fourier modes \u03c8\u0303(p) with p2 = 0. Thus we will assume that\nwe impose the Lorentz gauge with additional gauge transformations which leave only the tensorial\ncomponent and the modes of the scalar component \u03c8 with p2 6= 0 in Fourier space.\n(1)\nUsing the metric decomposition (6.64) we may compute the linearized Einstein tensor Gab . It is\nfound that the vectorial part of the metric perturbation gives no contribution to this tensor, and the\n(1) (S)\nscalar and tensorial components give rise, respectively, to scalar and tensorial components: Gab\n(1) (T )\n, respectively. Thus let us now write the Fourier transform of the homogeneous Einsteinand Gab\nLangevin equation (6.37), which is equivalent to the linearized semiclassical Einstein equation,\nF \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (p) G\u0303(1) \u03b1\u03b2 (p) = 0.\n48\n\n(6.66)\n\n\fUsing the previous decomposition of the Einstein tensor this equation can be re-written in terms\nof its scalar and tensorial parts as\nh\n\ni\n\n(S)\n(p) = 0,\nF1 (p) + 3p2 F2 (p) G\u0303(1)\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(6.67)\n\n(T)\nF1 (p)G\u0303(1)\n(p) = 0.\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(6.68)\n\n(1) (S)\n\n(1) (T)\n\nwhere F1 (p) and F2 (p) are given by Eqs. (6.39), and G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\nand G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\ndenote, respectively, the\nFourier transformed scalar and tensorial parts of the linearized Einstein tensor. To simplify the\nproblem and to illustrate, in particular, how the runaway solutions arise we will consider the case of\na massless and conformally coupled field; see Ref. [229] for the massless case with arbitrary coupling\nand Refs. [109, 113] for the general massive case. Thus substituting m = 0 and \u03be = 1/6 into the\nfunctions F1 (p) and F2 (p), and using Eq. (6.33), the above equations become:\n\nlim\n\n\u01eb\u21920+\n\n\"\n\n1+\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(S)\n1 + 12\u03ba\u03b2\u0304p2 G\u0303(1)\n(p) = 0,\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bap2\n\u2212(p0 + i\u01eb)2 + ~p 2\nln\n960\u03c0 2\n\u03bc2\n\n!#\n\n(T)\nG\u0303(1)\n(p) = 0,\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(6.69)\n(6.70)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 8\u03c0G. Let us consider these two equations separately.\n(1) (S)\nFor the scalar component when \u03b2\u0304 = 0 the only solution is G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (p) = 0. When \u03b2\u0304 > 0 the\nsolutions for the scalar component exhibit an oscillatory behavior in spacetime coordinates which\ncorresponds to a massive scalar field with m2 = (12\u03ba|\u03b2\u0304|)\u22121 ; for \u03b2\u0304 < 0 the solutions correspond\nto a tachyonic field with m2 = \u2212(12\u03ba|\u03b2\u0304|)\u22121 : in spacetime coordinates they exhibit an exponential\nbehavior in time, growing or decreasing, for wavelengths larger than 4\u03c0(3\u03ba|\u03b2\u0304|)1/2 , and an oscillatory\n(1) (S)\nbehavior for wavelengths smaller than 4\u03c0(3\u03ba|\u03b2\u0304|)1/2 . On the other hand, the solution G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (p) = 0\nis completely trivial since any scalar metric perturbation h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (p) giving rise to a vanishing linearized\nEinstein tensor can be eliminated by a gauge transformation.\nFor the tensorial component, when \u03bc \u2264 \u03bccrit = lp\u22121 (120\u03c0)1/2 e\u03b3 , where lp is the Planck length\n(lp2 \u2261 \u03ba/8\u03c0) the first factor in Eq. (6.70) vanishes for four complex values of p0 of the form \u00b1\u03c9 and\n\u00b1\u03c9 \u2217 , where \u03c9 is some complex value. This means that in the corresponding propagator, there are\ntwo poles on the upper half plane of the complex p0 plane and two poles in the lower half plane. We\nwill consider here the case in which \u03bc < \u03bccrit ; a detailed description of the situation for \u03bc \u2265 \u03bccrit\ncan be found in Appendix A of Ref. [229]. The two zeros on the upper half of the complex plane\ncorrespond to solutions in spacetime coordinates which exponentially grow in time, whereas the\ntwo on the lower half correspond to solutions exponentially decreasing in time. Strictly speaking,\nthese solutions only exist in spacetime coordinates, since their Fourier transform is not well defined.\nThey are commonly referred to as runaway solutions and for \u03bc \u223c lp\u22121 they grow exponentially in\ntime scales comparable to the Planck time.\n(1)\nConsequently, in addition to the solutions with Gab (x) = 0, there are other solutions that in\n(1)\nFourier space take the form G\u0303ab (p) \u221d \u03b4(p2 \u2212 p20 ) for some particular values of p0 , but all of them\nexhibit exponential instabilities with characteristic Planckian time scales. In order to deal with\nthose unstable solutions, one possibility is to make use of the order reduction prescription [230],\nwhich we will briefly summarize in the last subsection. Note that the p2 terms in Eqs. (6.69)\nand (6.70) come from two spacetime derivatives of the Einstein tensor, moreover, the p2 ln p2 term\ncomes from the nonlocal term of the expectation value of the stress tensor. The order reduction\n49\n\n\fprescription amounts here to neglecting these higher derivative terms. Thus, neglecting the terms\nproportional to p2 in Eqs. (6.69) and (6.70), we are left only with the solutions which satisfy\n(1)\nG\u0303ab (p) = 0. The result for the metric perturbation in the gauge introduced above can be obtained\nby solving for the Einstein tensor, which in the Lorentz gauge of Eq. (6.65) reads:\n1\n1\n(1)\nG\u0303ab (p) = p2 h\u0303ab (p) \u2212 \u03b7ab h\u0303cc (p) .\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(6.71)\n\nThese solutions for h\u0303ab (p) simply correspond to free linear gravitational waves propagating in\nMinkowski spacetime expressed in the transverse and traceless (TT) gauge. When substituting\nback into Eq. (6.63) and averaging over the initial conditions we simply get the symmetrized\nquantum correlation function for free gravitons in the TT gauge for the state given by the Wigner\ndistribution. As far as the intrinsic fluctuations are concerned, it seems that the order reduction\nprescription is too drastic, at least in the case of Minkowski spacetime, since no effects due to the\ninteraction with the quantum matter fields are left.\nA second possibility, proposed by Hawking et al. [137, 276], is to impose boundary conditions\nwhich discard the runaway solutions that grow unbounded in time. These boundary conditions\ncorrespond to a special prescription for the integration contour when Fourier transforming back\nto spacetime coordinates. As we will discuss in some more detail in the next subsection, this\nprescription reduces here to integrating along the real axis in the p0 complex plane. Following that\nprocedure we get, for example, that for a massless conformally coupled matter field with \u03b2\u0304 > 0\nthe intrinsic contribution to the symmetrized quantum correlation function coincides with that\nof free gravitons plus an extra contribution for the scalar part of the metric perturbations. This\nextra massive scalar renders Minkowski spacetime stable, but also plays a crucial role in providing a\ngraceful exit in inflationary models driven by the vacuum polarization of a large number of conformal\nfields. Such a massive scalar field would not be in conflict with present observations because, for the\nrange of parameters considered, the mass would be far too large to have observational consequences\n[137].\n6.5.2\n\nInduced metric fluctuations\n\nThe induced metric fluctuations are described by the second term in Eq. (3.16). They are dependent\non the noise kernel that describes the stress tensor fluctuations of the matter fields,\nhhab (x)hcd (y)iind =\n\n\u03ba\u03042\nN\n\nZ\n\nq\n\n\u2032\nef gh \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n(x , y )Gret\nd4 x\u2032 d4 y \u2032 g(x\u2032 )g(y \u2032 )Gret\nabef (x, x )N\ncdgh (y, y ),\n\n(6.72)\n\nwhere here we have written the expression in the large N limit, so that \u03ba\u0304 = N \u03ba (\u03ba = 8\u03c0G) and\nN is the number of independent free scalar fields. The contribution corresponding to the induced\nquantum fluctuations is equivalent to the stochastic correlation function obtained by considering\njust the inhomogeneous part of the solution to the Einstein-Langevin equation. We can make use\nof the results for the metric correlations obtained in sections 6.3 and 6.4 for solving the EinsteinLangevin equation. In fact, one should simply take N = 1 to transform our expressions here to those\nof sections 6.3 and 6.4 or, more precisely, one should multiply the noise kernel in the expressions of\nsections 6.3 and 6.4 by N in order to use those expressions here, as follows from the fact that now\nwe have N independent matter fields.\n\n50\n\n\fAs we have seen in section 6.4, following Ref. [109], the Einstein-Langevin equation can be\nentirely written in terms of the linearized Einstein tensor. The equation involves second spacetime\nderivatives of that tensor and in terms of its Fourier components is given in Eq. (6.37) as\nF \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (p) G\u0303(1) \u03b1\u03b2 (p) = \u03ba\u0304 \u03be\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd (p),\n\n(6.73)\n\nwhere we have used now the rescaled coupling \u03ba\u0304. The solution for the linearized Einstein tensor is\ngiven in Eq. (6.49) in terms of the retarded propagator D\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 (p) defined in Eq. (6.45). Now this\npropagator, which is written in Eq. (6.46), exhibits two poles in the upper half complex p0 plane\nand two poles in the lower half plane, as we have seen analyzing the zeros in Eqs. (6.69) and (6.70)\nfor the massless and conformally coupled case. The retarded propagator in spacetime coordinates\nis obtained as usual by taking the appropriate integration contour in the p0 plane. It is convenient\nin this case to deform the integration path along the real p0 axis so as to leave the two poles of the\nupper half plane below that path. In this way when closing the contour by un upper half circle, in\norder to compute the anti-causal part of the propagator, there will be no contribution. The problem\nnow is that when closing the contour on the lower half plane, in order to compute the causal part,\nthe contribution of the upper half plane poles gives an unbounded solution, a runaway instability.\nIf we adopt Hawking et al. [137, 276] criterion of imposing final boundary conditions which discard\nsolutions growing unboundedly in time this implies that we just need to take the integral along\nthe real axis, as was done in section 6.4.2. But now the propagator\nis no longer strictly retarded,\n\u221a\nthere are causality violations in time scales of the order of N lp , which should have no observable\nconsequences. This propagator, however, has well defined Fourier transform.\nFollowing the steps after Eq. (6.49) the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation for the\nlinearized Einstein tensor can be written in our case as,\n(1)\n\n\u2032\nhG\u0303(1)\n\u03bc\u03bd (p)G\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (p )iind =\n\n\u03ba\u03042\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b44(p + p\u2032 )D\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 (p)D\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03b3 (\u2212p)\u00d1 \u03c1\u03c3\u03bb\u03b3 (p),\nN\n\n(6.74)\n\nwhere the noise kernel \u00d1 \u03c1\u03c3\u03bb\u03b3 (p) is given by Eq. (6.41). Note that these correlation functions are\ninvariant under gauge transformations of the metric perturbations because the linearized Einstein\ntensor is invariant under those transformations.\nWe may also take the order reduction prescription which amounts in this case to neglecting\nterms in the propagator which are proportional to p2 , corresponding to two spacetime derivatives\nof the Einstein tensor. The propagator then becomes a constant, and we have\n(1)\n\n\u2032\nhG\u0303(1)\n\u03bc\u03bd (p)G\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (p )iind =\n\n\u03ba\u03042\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b44(p+p\u2032 )\u00d1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (p).\nN\n\n(6.75)\n\nFinally we may derive the correlations for the metric perturbations from these equations (6.74)\nor (6.75). In the Lorentz or harmonic gauge the linearized Einstein tensor takes the particularly\nsimple form of Eq. (6.71) in terms of the metric perturbation. One may derive the correlation\nfunctions for h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (p) as it was done in section 6.4.2 to get\n \u0303 (p)h\u0304\n \u0303 (p\u2032 )i =\nhh\u0304\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\nind\n\n4\nhG\u0303\u03bc\u03bd (p)G\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 (p\u2032 )iind .\n(p2 )2\n\n(6.76)\n\nThere will be one possible expression for the two-point metric correlation which corresponds to the\nEinstein tensor correlation of Eq. (6.74) and another expression corresponding to Eq. (6.74), when\n51\n\n\fthe order reduction prescription is used. We should note that contrary to the correlation functions\nfor the Einstein tensor, the two-point metric correlation is not gauge invariant (it is given in the\nLorentz gauge). Moreover, when taking the Fourier transform to get the correlations in spacetime\ncoordinates there is an apparent infrared divergence when p2 = 0 in the massless case. This can\nbe seen from the expression for the noise kernel \u00d1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (p) defined in Eq. (6.41). For the massive\ncase no such divergence due to the factor \u03b8(\u2212p2 \u2212 4m2 ) exists, but as one takes the limit m \u2192 0 it\nwill show up. This infrared divergence, however, is a gauge artifact that has been enforced by the\nuse of the Lorentz gauge. A gauge different from the Lorentz gauge should be used in the massless\ncase; see Ref. [118] for a more detailed discussion of this point.\nLet us now write the two-point metric correlation function in spacetime coordinates for the\nmassless and conformally coupled fields. In order to avoid runaway solutions we use the prescription\nthat the propagator should have a well defined Fourier transform, by integrating along the real axis\nin the complex p0 plane. This was, in fact, done in section 6.4.3, see Eq. (6.62), which we may\nwrite now as\nZ\n2\nd4 p eip(x\u2212y) P\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b8(\u2212p2 )\n \u0303 (x)h\u0304\n \u0303 (y)i = \u03ba\u0304\n,\n(6.77)\nhh\u0304\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\nind\n720\u03c0N\n(2\u03c0)4 |1 + (\u03ba\u0304/2)p2 H\u0303(p; \u03bc\u03042 )|2\n\nwhere the projector P\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is defined in Eq. (6.23). This correlation function for the metric perturbations is in agreement with the real part of the graviton propagator obtained by Tomboulis\nin Ref. [215] using a large N expansion with Fermion fields. Note that when the order reduction\nprescription is used the terms in the denominator of Eq. (6.77) which are proportional to p2 are neglected. Thus, in contrast to the intrinsic metric fluctuations, there is still a nontrivial contribution\nto the induced metric fluctuations due to the quantum matter fields in this case.\nTo estimate the above integral let us follow section 6.4.3 and consider space like separated\npoints x \u2212 y = (0, r) and introduce the Planck length lp . For space separations\n|r| \u226b lp we have\n\u221a\nthat the two-point correlation (6.77) goes like \u223c N lp4 /|r|4 , and for |r| \u223c N lp we have that they\n\u221a\ngo like \u223c exp(\u2212|r|/ N lp )lp /|r|. Since these metric fluctuations are induced by the matter stress\nfluctuations we infer that the effect of the matter fields is to suppress metric fluctuations at small\nscales. On the other hand, at large scales the induced metric fluctuations are small compared to\nthe free graviton propagator which goes like lp2 /|r|2 .\nWe thus conclude that, once the instabilities giving rise to the unphysical runaway solutions\nhave been discarded, the fluctuations of the metric perturbations around the Minkowski spacetime\ninduced by the interaction with quantum scalar fields are indeed stable (instabilities lead to divergent results when Fourier transforming back to spacetime coordinates). We have found that,\nindeed, both the intrinsic and the induced contributions to the quantum correlation functions of\nmetric perturbations are stable, and consequently Minkowski spacetime is stable.\n6.5.3\n\nOrder reduction prescription and large N\n\nRunaway solutions are a typical feature of equations describing back-reaction effects, such is in\nclassical electrodynamics, and are due to higher than two time derivatives in the dynamical equations. Here we will give a qualitative analysis of this problem in semiclassical gravity. In a very\nschematic way the semiclassical Einstein equations have the form\nGh + lp2 G\u0308h = 0,\n\n52\n\n(6.78)\n\n\fwhere Gh stands for the linearized Einstein tensor over the Minkowski background, say, and we have\nsimplified the equation as much as possible. The second term of the equation is due to the vacuum\npolarization of matter fields and contains four time derivatives of the metric perturbation. Some\nspecific examples of such an equation are, in momentum space, Eqs. (6.69) and (6.70). The order\nreduction procedure is based on treating perturbatively the terms involving higher order derivatives,\ndifferentiating the equation under consideration and substituting back the higher derivative terms in\nthe original equation keeping only terms up to the required order in the perturbative parameter. In\nthe case of the semiclassical Einstein equation, the perturbative parameter is lp2 . If we differentiate\ntwice Eq. (6.78) with respect to time it is clear that the second order derivatives of the Einstein\ntensor are of order lp2 . Substituting back into the original equation, we get the following equation\nup to order lp4 : Gh = 0 + O(lp4 ). Now, there are certainly no runaway solutions but also no effect\ndue to the vacuum polarization of matter fields. Note that the result is not so trivial when there is\nan inhomogeneous term on the right hand side of Eq. (6.78), this is what happens with the induced\nfluctuations predicted by the Einstein-Langevin equation.\nSemiclassical gravity is expected to provide reliable results as long as the characteristic length\nscales under consideration, say L, satisfy that L \u226b lp [229]. This can be qualitatively argued by\nestimating the magnitude of the different contributions to the effective action for the gravitational\nfield, considering the relevant Feynman diagrams and using dimensional arguments. Let us write\nthe effective gravitational action, again in a very schematic way, as\nSeff =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212g\n\n!\n\n1\nR + \u03b1R2 + lp2 R3 + . . . ,\nlp2\n\n(6.79)\n\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar. The first term is the usual classical Einstein-Hilbert term, the second\nstands for terms quadratic in the curvature (square of Ricci and Weyl tensors) these terms appear\nas radiative corrections due to vacuum polarization of matter fields, here \u03b1 is a dimensionless\nparameter presumably of order 1, the R3 terms are higher order corrections which appear for\ninstance when one considers internal graviton propagators inside matter loops. Let us assume that\nR \u223c L\u22122 then the different terms in the action are of the order of R2 \u223c L\u22124 and lp2 R3 \u223c lp2 L\u22126 .\nConsequently when L \u226b lp2 , the term due to matter loops is a small correction to the EinsteinHilbert term (1/lp2 )R \u226b R2 , and this term can be treated as a perturbation. The justification of the\norder reduction prescription is actually based on this fact. Therefore, significant effects from the\nvacuum polarization of the matter fields are only expected when their small corrections accumulate\nin time, as would be the case, for instance, for an evaporating macroscopic black hole all the way\nbefore reaching Planckian scales (see section 8.3).\nHowever if we have a large number N of matter fields the estimates for the different terms\nchange in a remarkable way. This is interesting because the large N expansion seems, as we have\nargued in section 3.3.1, the best justification for semiclassical gravity. In fact, now the N vacuum\npolarization terms involving loops of matter are of order N R2 \u223c N L\u22124 . For this reason the\ncontribution of the graviton loops, which is just of order R2 as any other loop of matter, can be\nneglected in front of the matter loops; this justifies the semiclassical limit. Similarly\n\u221a higher order\ncorrections are of order N lp2 R3 \u223c N lp2 L\u22126 . Now there is a regime, when L \u223c N lp , where the\nEinstein-Hilbert term is comparable to the vacuum polarization of matter fields, (1/lp2 )R \u223c N R2 ,\nand yet the higher correction terms can be neglected because we still have L \u226b lp , provided N \u226b 1.\nThis is the kind of situation considered in trace anomaly driven inflationary models [137], such as\nthat originally proposed by Starobinsky [135], see also Ref. [136], where exponential inflation is\n53\n\n\fdriven by a large number of massless conformal fields. The order reduction prescription would\ncompletely discard the effect from the vacuum polarization of the matter fields even though it is\ncomparable to the Einstein-Hilbert term. In contrast, the procedure proposed by Hawking et al.\nkeeps the contribution from the matter fields. Note that here the actual physical Planck length lp\nis considered, not the rescaled one,  \u0304lp2 = \u03ba\u0304/8\u03c0, which is related to lp by lp2 = \u03ba/8\u03c0 =  \u0304lp2 /N .\n6.5.4\n\nSummary\n\nAn analysis of the stability of any solution of semiclassical gravity with respect to small quantum\nperturbations should include not only the evolution of the expectation value of the metric perturbations around that solution, but also their fluctuations, encoded in the quantum correlation\nfunctions. Making use of the equivalence (to leading order in 1/N , where N is the number of matter fields) between the stochastic correlation functions obtained in stochastic semiclassical gravity\nand the quantum correlation functions for metric perturbations around a solution of semiclassical\ngravity, the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation function for the metric perturbations can\nbe decomposed into two different parts: the intrinsic metric fluctuations due to the fluctuations of\nthe initial state of the metric perturbations itself, and the fluctuations induced by their interaction\nwith the matter fields. From the linearized perturbations of the semiclassical Einstein equation, information on the intrinsic metric fluctuations can be retrieved. On the other hand, the information\non the induced metric fluctuations naturally follows from the solutions of the Einstein-Langevin\nequation.\nWe have analyzed the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation function for the metric\nperturbations around the Minkowski spacetime interacting with N scalar fields initially in the\nMinkowski vacuum state. Once the instabilities that arise in semiclassical gravity which are commonly regarded as unphysical, have been properly dealt with by using the order reduction prescription or the procedure proposed by Hawking et al. [137, 276], both the intrinsic and the induced\ncontributions to the quantum correlation function for the metric perturbations are found to be stable [118]. Thus, we conclude that Minkowski spacetime is a valid solution of semiclassical gravity.\n\n7\n\nStructure formation in the early universe\n\nStructure formation in the early universe is a key problem in modern cosmology. It is believed that\ngalaxies, clusters or any large scale structure observed today originated from random sources of\nprimordial inhomogeneities (density contrast) in the early universe amplified by the expansion of the\nuniverse. Theories of structure formation based on general relativity theory have been in existence\nfor over 60 years [277, 278, 193] (see e.g., [279, 280, 281]) long before the advent of inflationary\ncosmology [282, 283, 284] but the inflation paradigm [195, 196, 197, 198] provided at least two\nmajor improvements in the modern theory of cosmological structure formation [285, 286, 287, 288]:\n\u2022 The sources: instead of a classical white noise source arbitrarily specified, the seeds of structures of the new theory are from quantum fluctuations which obey equations derivable from\nthe dynamics of the inflaton field, the quantum field which is responsible for driving inflation.\n\u2022 The spectrum: The almost scale- invariant spectrum (masses of galaxies as a function of\ntheir scales) has a more natural explanation from the almost exponential expansion of the\n\n54\n\n\finflationary universe than from the power law expansion of the FRW universe in the traditional\ntheory.\nStochastic gravity provides a sound and natural formalism for the derivation of the cosmological\nperturbations generated during inflation. In Ref. [134] it was shown that the correlation functions\nthat follow from the Einstein-Langevin equation which emerges in the framework of stochastic\ngravity coincide with that obtained with the usual quantization procedures [288] when both the\nmetric perturbations and the inflaton fluctuations are linearized. Stochastic gravity, however, can\nnaturally deal with the fluctuations of the inflaton field even beyond the linear approximation. In\nthe last subsection we will enumerate possible advantages of the stochastic gravity treatment of this\nproblem over the usual methods based on the quantization of the linear cosmological and inflaton\nperturbations.\nWe should point out that the equivalence at the linearized level is proved in Ref. [134] directly\nfrom the field equations of the perturbations and by showing that the stochastic and the quantum\ncorrelations are both given by identical expressions. Within the stochastic gravity framework an\nexplicit computation of the curvature perturbation correlations was performed by Urakawa and\nMaeda [289]. A convenient approximation for that computation, used by these authors, leads only\nto a small discrepancy with the usual approach for the observationally relevant part of the spectrum.\nWe think the deviation from the standard result found for superhorizon modes would not arise if\nan exact calculation were used.\nHere, we illustrate the equivalence with the conventional approach with one of the simplest\nchaotic inflationary models in which the background spacetime is a quasi de Sitter universe [217,\n134].\n\n7.1\n\nThe model\n\nIn this chaotic inflationary model [283] the inflaton field \u03c6 of mass m is described by the following\nLagrangian density,\n1\n1\n(7.1)\nL(\u03c6) = gab \u2207a \u03c6\u2207b \u03c6 + m2 \u03c62 .\n2\n2\nThe conditions for the existence of an inflationary period, which is characterized by an accelerated\ncosmological expansion, is that the value of the field over a region with the typical size of the Hubble\nradius is higher than the Planck mass mP . This is because in order to solve the cosmological horizon\nand flatness problem more than 60 e-folds of expansion are needed, to achieve this the scalar field\nshould begin with a value higher than 3mP . The inflaton mass is small: as we will see, the large\nscale anisotropies measured in the cosmic background radiation [290] restrict the inflaton mass to\nbe of the order of 10\u22126 mP . We will not discuss the naturalness of this inflationary model but simply\nassume that if one such region is found (inside a much larger universe) it will inflate to become our\nobservable universe.\nWe want to study the metric perturbations produced by the stress-energy tensor fluctuations\nof the inflaton field on the homogeneous background of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model,\ndescribed by the cosmological scale factor a(\u03b7), where \u03b7 is the conformal time, which is driven by\nthe homogeneous inflaton field \u03c6(\u03b7) = h\u03c6\u0302i. Thus we write the inflaton field in the following form\n\u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6(\u03b7) + \u03c6\u0302(x),\n\n55\n\n(7.2)\n\n\fwhere \u03c6\u0302(x) corresponds to a free massive quantum scalar field with zero expectation value on\nthe homogeneous background metric: h\u03c6\u0302i = 0. We will restrict ourselves to scalar-type metric\nperturbations because these are the ones that couple to the inflaton fluctuations in the linear\ntheory. We note that this is not so if we were to consider inflaton fluctuations beyond the linear\napproximation, then tensorial and vectorial metric perturbations would also arise. The perturbed\nmetric g\u0303ab = gab + hab can be written in the longitudinal gauge as,\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7)[\u2212(1 + 2\u03a6(x))d\u03b7 2 + (1 \u2212 2\u03a8(x))\u03b4ij dxi dxj ],\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere the scalar metric perturbations \u03a6(x) and \u03a8(x) correspond to Bardeen's gauge invariant\nvariables [280].\n\n7.2\n\nEinstein-Langevin equation for scalar metric perturbations\n\nThe Einstein-Langevin equation as described in Sec. 3 is gauge invariant, and thus we can work in\na desired gauge and then extract the gauge invariant quantities. The Einstein-Langevin equation\n(3.14) now reads:\n(0)\n(0)\n(1)\n(1)\nGab \u2212 8\u03c0GhT\u0302ab i + Gab (h) \u2212 8\u03c0GhT\u02c6ab (h)i = 8\u03c0G\u03beab ,\n(7.4)\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nNote that the two first terms cancel, that is, Gab \u2212 8\u03c0GhT\u0302ab i = 0, if the background metric is a\nsolution of the semiclassical Einstein equations. Here the subscripts (0) and (1) refer to functions\nin the background metric gab and linear in the metric perturbation hab , respectively. The stress\ntensor operator T\u0302ab for the minimally coupled inflaton field in the perturbed metric is:\n \u0303 c \u03c6\u0302\u2207\n \u0303 c \u03c6\u0302 + m2 \u03c6\u03022 ).\n \u0303 b \u03c6\u0302 + 1 g\u0303ab (\u2207\n \u0303 a \u03c6\u0302\u2207\nT\u0302ab = \u2207\n2\n\n(7.5)\n\nUsing the decomposition of the scalar field into its homogeneous and inhomogeneous part, see\nEq. (7.2), and the metric g\u0303ab into its homogeneous background gab and its perturbation hab , the\nrenormalized expectation value for the stress-energy tensor operator can be written as\nR\nR\nhT\u0302ab\n[g\u0303]i = hT\u0302ab [g\u0303]i\u03c6\u03c6 + hT\u0302ab [g\u0303]i\u03c6\u03c6 + hT\u0302ab\n[g\u0303]i\u03c6\u03c6 ,\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere the subindices indicate the degree of dependence on the homogeneous field \u03c6 and its perturbation \u03c6. The first term in this equation depends only on the homogeneous field and it is given by\nthe classical expression. The second term is proportional to h\u03c6\u0302[g\u0303]i which is not zero because the\nfield dynamics is considered on the perturbed spacetime, i.e., this term includes the coupling of\nthe field with hab and may be obtained from the expectation value of the linearized Klein-Gordon\nequation,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2737g+h \u2212 m2 \u03c6\u0302 = 0.\n(7.7)\nThe last term in Eq. (7.6) corresponds to the expectation value of the stress tensor for a free scalar\nfield on the spacetime of the perturbed metric.\nAfter using the previous decomposition, the noise kernel Nabcd [g; x, y) defined in Eq. (3.11) can\nbe written as\nh{t\u0302ab [g; x), t\u0302cd [g; y)}i = h{t\u0302ab [g; x), t\u0302cd [g; y)}i(\u03c6\u03c6)2\n+h{t\u0302ab [g; x), t\u02c6cd [g; y)}i(\u03c6\u03c6)2 ,\n56\n\n(7.8)\n\n\fwhere we have used the fact that h\u03c6\u0302i = 0 = h\u03c6\u0302\u03c6\u0302\u03c6\u0302i for Gaussian states on the background geometry.\nWe consider the vacuum state to be the Euclidean vacuum which is preferred in the de Sitter\nbackground, and this state is Gaussian. In the above equation the first term is quadratic in \u03c6\u0302\nwhereas the second one is quartic, both contributions to the noise kernel are separately conserved\nsince both \u03c6(\u03b7) and \u03c6\u0302 satisfy the Klein-Gordon field equations on the background spacetime.\nConsequently, the two terms can be considered separately. On the other hand, if one treats \u03c6\u0302 as a\nsmall perturbation the second term in (7.8) is of lower order than the first and may be consistently\nneglected, this corresponds to neglecting the last term of Eq. (7.6). The stress tensor fluctuations\ndue to a term of that kind were considered in Ref. [291].\nWe can now write down the Einstein-Langevin equations (7.4) to linear order in the inflaton\nfluctuations. It is easy to check [134] that the space-space components coming from the stress tensor\nexpectation value terms and the stochastic tensor are diagonal, i.e. hT\u0302ij i = 0 = \u03beij for i 6= j. This,\nin turn, implies that the two functions characterizing the scalar metric perturbations are equal:\n\u03a6 = \u03a8 in agreement with ref. [288]. The equation for \u03a6 can be obtained from the 0i-component of\nthe Einstein-Langevin equation which, neglecting a nonlocal term, reads in Fourier space as\n2iki (H\u03a6k + \u03a6\u2032k ) = 8\u03c0G(\u03be0i )k ,\n\n(7.9)\n\nwhere ki is the comoving momentum\ncomponent associated to the comoving coordinate xi , and we\nR 3\nhave used the definition \u03a6k (\u03b7) = d x exp(\u2212i~k * ~x)\u03a6(\u03b7, ~x). Here primes denote derivatives with\nrespect to the conformal time \u03b7 and H = a\u2032 /a. A nonlocal term of dissipative character which\ncomes from the second term in Eq. (7.6) should also appear on the left hand side of Eq. (7.9), but\nwe have neglected it to simplify the forthcoming expressions (the large scale spectrum does not\nchange in a substantial way). We must emphasize, however, that the proof of the equivalence of\nthe stochastic approach to linear order in \u03c6\u0302 to the usual linear cosmological perturbations approach\ndoes not assume that simplification [134]. To solve Eq. (7.9), whose left-hand side comes from the\nlinearized Einstein tensor for the perturbed metric [288], we need the retarded propagator for the\ngravitational potential \u03a6k ,\nGk (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) = \u2212i\n\n4\u03c0\nki m2P\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 )\n\na(\u03b7 \u2032 )\n+ f (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) ,\na(\u03b7)\n\u0013\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere f is a homogeneous solution of Eq. (7.9) related to the initial conditions chosen and m2P =\n1/G. For instance, if we take f (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) = \u2212\u03b8(\u03b70 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 )a(\u03b7 \u2032 )/a(\u03b7) the solution would correspond to\n\"turning on\" the stochastic source at \u03b70 . With the solution of the Einstein-Langevin equation (7.9)\nfor the scalar metric perturbations we are in the position to compute the two-point correlation\nfunctions for these perturbations.\n\n7.3\n\nCorrelation functions for scalar metric perturbations\n\nThe two-point correlation function for the scalar metric perturbations induced by the inflaton\nfluctuations is thus given by\nh\u03a6k (\u03b7)\u03a6k\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2032 )is = (2\u03c0)2 \u03b4(~k + ~k\u2032 )\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7\n\nd\u03b71\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7\u2032\n\nd\u03b72 Gk (\u03b7, \u03b71 )Gk\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2032 , \u03b72 )h(\u03be0i )k (\u03b71 )(\u03be0i )k\u2032 (\u03b72 )is .\n\n57\n\n(7.11)\n\n\fHere the two-point correlation function for the stochastic source, which is connected to the stressenergy tensor fluctuations through the noise kernel, is given by,\n1\nh{(t\u03020i )k (\u03b71 ), (t\u03020i )\u2212k (\u03b72 )}i\u03c6\u03c6\n2\n1\n(1)\n= ki ki \u03c6\u2032 (\u03b71 )\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b72 )Gk (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ),\n2\n\nh(\u03be0i )k (\u03b71 )(\u03be0i )\u2212k (\u03b72 )is =\n\n(7.12)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Gk (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) = h{\u03c6\u0302k (\u03b71 ), \u03c6\u0302\u2212k (\u03b72 )}i is the kth-mode Hadamard function for a free minimally\ncoupled scalar field in the appropriate vacuum state on the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background.\nIn practice, to make the explicit computation of the Hadamard function we will assume that the\nfield state is in the Euclidean vacuum and the background spacetime is de Sitter. Furthermore we\nwill compute the Hadamard function for a massless field, and will make a perturbative expansion\nin terms of the dimensionless parameter m/mP . Thus we consider\n(1)\n\n\u1e20k (\u03b71 , \u03b72 ) = h0|{\u0177k (\u03b71 ), \u0177\u2212k (\u03b72 )}|0i = 2R (uk (\u03b71 )u\u2217k (\u03b72 )) ,\nwith\n\n\u0177k (\u03b7) = a(\u03b7)\u03c6\u0302k (\u03b7) = \u00e2k uk (\u03b7) + \u00e2\u2020\u2212k u\u2217\u2212k (\u03b7),\n\nand where\nuk = (2k)\u22121/2 eik\u03b7 (1 \u2212 i/\u03b7)\nare the positive frequency k-modes for a massless minimally coupled scalar field on a de Sitter\nbackground, which define the Euclidean vacuum state, \u00e2k |0i = 0 [32].\nThe assumption of a massless field for the computation of the Hadamard function is made\nbecause massless modes in de Sitter are much simpler to deal with than massive modes. We\ncan see that this is nonetheless a reasonable approximation as follows: For a given mode the\nm = 0 approximation is reasonable when its wavelength \u03bb is shorter than the Compton wavelength,\n\u03bbc = 1/m. In our case we have a very small mass m and the horizon size H \u22121 , where H is the\nHubble constant H = \u0227/a (here a(t) with t the physical time dt = ad\u03b7), satisfies that H \u22121 < \u03bbc .\nThus, for modes inside the horizon \u03bb < \u03bbc and m = 0 is a good approximation. Outside the horizon\nmassive modes decay in amplitude as \u223c exp(\u2212m2 t/3H) whereas massless modes remain constant,\nthus when modes leave the horizon the approximation will eventually break down. However, we\nonly need to ensure that the approximation is still valid after 60 e-folds, i.e. H\u2206t \u223c 60 (\u2206t being\nthe time between horizon exit and the end of inflation). But this is the case provided 3H 2 /m2 > 60,\nsince the decay factor \u223c exp[\u2212(m2 /3H 2 )H\u2206t] will not be too different from unity for those modes\nthat left the horizon during the last sixty e-folds of inflation. This condition is indeed satisfied\ngiven that m \u226a H in most slow-roll inflationary models [282, 281], and in particular for the model\nconsidered here where m \u223c 10\u22126 mP .\nWe note that the background geometry is not exactly that of de Sitter spacetime, for which\na(\u03b7) = \u2212(H\u03b7)\u22121 with \u2212\u221e < \u03b7 < 0. One can expand in terms of the \"slow-roll\" parameters and\nassume that to first order \u03c6\u0307(t) \u2243 m2P (m/mP ), where t is the physical time. The correlation function\nfor the metric perturbation (7.11) can then be easily computed; see Ref. [217, 134] for details. The\nfinal result, however, is very weakly dependent on the initial conditions as one may understand\nfrom the fact that the accelerated expansion of the quasi-de Sitter spacetime during inflation erases\n58\n\n\fthe information about the initial conditions. Thus one may take the initial time to be \u03b70 = \u2212\u221e\nand obtain to lowest order in m/mP the expression\nh\u03a6k (\u03b7)\u03a6k\u2032 (\u03b7 \u2032 )is \u2243 8\u03c0 2\n\n\u0012\n\nm\nmP\n\n\u00132\n\nk\u22123 (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(~k + ~k\u2032 ) cos k(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 ).\n\n(7.13)\n\nFrom this result two main conclusions can be derived. First, the prediction of an almost scaleinvariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum for large scales, i.e. small values of k. Second, since the\ncorrelation function is of the order of (m/mP )2 a severe bound to the mass m is imposed by\nthe gravitational fluctuations derived from the small values of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) anisotropies detected by COBE. This bound is of the order of (m/mP ) \u223c 10\u22126 [290, 288].\nWe now comment on some differences with Refs. [130, 131, 132, 133] which used a self-interacting\nscalar field or a scalar field interacting nonlinearly with other fields. In those works an important\nrelaxation of the ratio m/mP was found. The long wavelength modes of the inflaton field were\nregarded as an open system in an environment made out of the shorter wavelength modes. Then,\nLangevin type equations were used to compute the correlations of the long wavelength modes driven\nby the fluctuations of the shorter wavelength modes. In order to get a significant relaxation on the\nabove ratio, however, one had to assume that the correlations of the free long wavelength modes,\nwhich correspond to the dispersion of the system's initial state, had to be very small. Otherwise\nthey dominate by several orders of magnitude those fluctuations that come from the noise of the\nenvironment. This would require a great amount of fine-tuning for the initial quantum state of\neach mode [134].\nWe should remark that in the linear model discussed here there is no environment for the\ninflaton fluctuations. When one linearizes with respect to both the scalar metric perturbations\nand the inflaton perturbations, the system cannot be regarded as a true open quantum system.\nThe reason is that Fourier modes decouple and the dynamical constraints due to diffeomorphism\ninvariance link the metric perturbations of scalar type with the perturbations of the inflaton field\nso that only one true dynamical degree of freedom is left for each Fourier mode. Nevertheless, the\ninflaton fluctuations are responsible for the noise that induces the metric perturbations.\n\n7.4\n\nSummary and outlook\n\nStochastic gravity provides an alternative framework to study the generation of primordial inhomogeneities in inflationary models. Besides the interest of the problem in its own right, there are\nalso other reasons that make this problem worth discussing from the point of view of stochastic\ngravity. The Einstein-Langevin equation is not restricted by the use of linearized perturbations of\nthe inflaton field. In practice this may not be very important for inflationary models which are\ndriven by an inflaton field which takes a non-zero expectation value, because the linear perturbations will give the leading contribution. However, the importance of considering corrections due\nto one-loop contributions from the inflaton field perturbations, beyond the tree level of the linear\ncosmological perturbation theory, has recently been emphasized by Weinberg [292, 293] as a means\nto understand the consequences of the theory even where in practice its predictions may not be\nobserved. Note also Refs. [294, 295] for the effect of the quantum gravitational loop corrections on\nthe dynamics of the inflaton field.\nIn the stochastic gravity approach some insights on the exact treatment of the inflaton scalar\nfield perturbations have been discussed in Refs. [134, 289, 296]. The main features that would characterize an exact treatment of the inflaton perturbations are the following. First, the three types\n59\n\n\fof metric perturbations (scalar, vectorial and tensorial perturbations) couple to the perturbations\nof the inflaton field. Second, the corresponding Einstein-Langevin equation for the linear metric\nperturbations will explicitly couple the scalar and tensorial metric perturbations. Furthermore,\nalthough the Fourier modes (with respect to the spatial coordinates) for the metric perturbations\nwill still decouple in the Einstein-Langevin equation, any given mode of the noise and dissipation kernels will get contributions from an infinite number of Fourier modes of the inflaton field\nperturbations. This fact will imply, in addition, the need to properly renormalize the ultraviolet\ndivergences arising in the dissipation kernel, which actually correspond to the divergences associated with the expectation value of the stress tensor operator of the quantum matter field evolving\non the perturbed geometry.\nWe should remark that although the gravitational fluctuations are here assumed to be classical, the correlation functions obtained correspond to the expectation values of the symmetrized\nquantum metric perturbations [218, 134]. This means that even in the absence of decoherence,\nthe fluctuations predicted by the Einstein-Langevin equation still give the correct symmetrized\nquantum two-point correlation functions. In Ref. [218] it was explained how a stochastic description based on a Langevin-type equation could be introduced to gain information on fully quantum\nproperties of simple linear open systems. In a forthcoming paper [211] it will be shown that, by\ncarefully dealing with the gauge freedom and the consequent dynamical constraints, this result can\nbe extended to the case of N free quantum matter fields interacting with the metric perturbations\naround a given background. In particular, the correlation functions for the metric perturbations\nobtained using the Einstein-Langevin equation are equivalent to the correlation functions that\nwould follow from a purely quantum field theory calculation up to the leading order contribution\nin the large N limit. This will generalize the results already obtained on a Minkowski background\n[118, 119].\nThese results have important implications on the use of the Einstein-Langevin equation to address situations in which the background configuration for the scalar field vanishes. This includes\nnot only the case of a Minkowski background spacetime, but also the remarkably interesting case of\nthe trace anomaly induced inflation. That is, inflationary models driven by the vacuum polarization\nof a large number of conformal fields [135, 136, 137], where the usual approaches based on the linearization of both the metric perturbations and the scalar field perturbations and their subsequent\nquantization can no longer be applied. More specifically, the semiclassical Einstein equations (3.7)\nfor massless quantum fields conformally coupled to the gravitational field admit an inflationary\nsolution that begins in an almost de Sitter like regime and ends up in a matter-dominated like\nregime [135, 136]. In these models the standard approach based on the quantization of the gravitational and the matter fields to linear order cannot be used because the calculation of the metric\nperturbations correspond to having only the last term in the noise kernel in Eq. (7.8), since there\nis no homogeneous field \u03c6(\u03b7) as the expectation value h\u03c6\u0302i = 0, and linearization becomes trivial.\nIn the trace anomaly induced inflation model Hawking et al. [137] were able to compute the\ntwo-point quantum correlation function for scalar and tensorial metric perturbations in a spatially\nclosed de Sitter universe, making use of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory correspondence.\nThey find that short scale metric perturbations are strongly suppressed by the conformal matter\nfields. This is similar to what we obtained in Sec. 6 for the induced metric fluctuations in Minkowski\nspacetime. In the stochastic gravity context, the noise kernel in a spatially closed de Sitter background was derived in Ref. [291], and in a spatially-flat arbitrary Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmodel the Einstein-Langevin equations describing the metric perturbations were first obtained in\n60\n\n\fRef. [104]. The computation of the corresponding two-point correlation functions for the metric\nperturbations is now work in progress.\n\n8\n\nBlack Hole Backreaction and Fluctuations\n\nAs another illustration of the application of stochastic gravity we now consider the backreaction and\nfluctuations in black hole spacetimes. Backreaction refers to the quantum effects of matter fields\nsuch as vacuum polarization, quantum fluctuations and particle creation on the spacetime structure\nand dynamics. Studying the dynamics of quantum fields in a fixed background spacetime, Hawking\nfound that black holes emit thermal radiation with a temperature inversely proportional to their\nmass [184, 185, 186, 187]. When the backreaction of the quantum fields on the spacetime dynamics\nis included, one expects that the mass of the black hole decreases as thermal radiation at higher and\nhigher temperatures is emitted. The reduction of the mass of a black hole due to particle creation\nis often referred to as the black hole 'evaporation' process. Backreaction of Hawking radiation\n[297, 298, 233, 234, 235, 299, 300, 301] could alter the evolution of the background spacetime and\nchange the nature of its end state, more drastically so for Planck size black holes.\nBackreaction is a technically challenging but conceptually rewarding problem. Progress is slow\nin this long standing problem but it cannot be ignored because existing results from test field\napproximations or semiclassical analysis are not trustworthy when backreaction becomes strong\nenough as to alter the structure and dynamics of the background spacetime. At the least one needs\nto know how strong the backreaction effects are under what circumstances the existing predictions\nmake sense. Without an exact quantum solution of the black hole plus quantum field system\nor at least a full backreaction consideration including the intrinsic and induced effects of metric\nfluctuations, much of the long speculations on the end-state of black hole collapse \u2013 remnants,\nnaked singularity, baby universe formation or complete evaporation (see e.g., [302, 303, 304, 305,\n306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312].) \u2013 and the information loss issue [313, 314, 315, 316] (see, e.g.,\n[317, 318] for an overview, and recent results from quantum information [319, 320]) will remain\nto be speculations and puzzles. This issue also enters in the extension of the well-known black\nhole thermodynamics [321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334] to\nnonequilibrium conditions [161] and can lead to new inferences on the microscopic structure of\nspacetime and the true nature of Einstein's equations [160] along the viewpoint regarding general\nrelativity as geometro-hydrodynamics and gravity as emergent phenomena. (See the nontraditional\nviews of Volovik [159, 162], Hu [157, 169, 168] on spacetime structure, Wen [335, 166, 336, 167] on\nquantum order, Seiberg [164], Horowitz and Polchinsky [165] on emergent gravity, Herzog on the\nhydrodynamics of M-theory [163] and the seminal work of Unruh, Jacobson [337, 338] leading to\nanalog gravity [49, 50, 51].)\n\n8.1\n\nGeneral Issues on Backreaction\n\nBackreaction studies of quantum field processes in cosmological spacetimes have progressed further\nthan the corresponding black hole problems, partly because of relative technical simplicity associated with the higher symmetry of relevant cosmological background geometries. (For a summary\nof the cosmological backreaction problem treated in the stochastic gravity theory, see [4]). The way\nhow the problem is set up and approached (e.g. via effective action) in these previously studied\nmodels can be carried over to black hole problems. In fact since the interior of a black hole can be\n61\n\n\fdescribed by a cosmological model (e.g. the Kantowski-Sachs universe for a spherically symmetric\nblack hole), some aspects even convey directly. The latest important work on this problem is that\nof Hiscock, Larson and Anderson [47] on backreaction in the interior of a black hole, where one can\nfind a concise summary of earlier work.\n8.1.1\n\nRegularized Energy Momentum Tensor\n\nThe first step in a backreaction problem is to find a regularized energy momentum tensor of the\nquantum fields using reasonable techniques since the expectation value of which serves as the source\nin the semiclassical Einstein equation. For this, much work started in the 80's (and still ongoing\nsparingly) are concerned with finding the right approximations for the regularized energy momentum tensor [339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 47]. Even in the simplest spherically symmetric spacetime,\nincluding the important Schwarzschild metric, is technically quite involved. To name a few of the\nimportant landmarks in this endeavor (this is adopted from [47]), Howard and Candelas [345, 346]\nhave computed the stress-energy of a conformally invariant scalar field in the Schwarzschild geometry. Jensen and Ottewill [347] have computed the vacuum stress-energy of a massless vector\nfield in Schwarzschild. Approximation methods have been developed by Page, Brown, and Ottewill\n[348, 349, 350] for conformally invariant fields in Schwarzschild spacetime, Frolov and Zel'nikov\n[351] for conformally invariant fields in a general static spacetime, Anderson, Hiscock and Samuel\n[342, 343] for massless arbitrarily coupled scalar fields in a general static spherically symmetric\nspacetime. Furthermore the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation has been derived by Frolov and\nZel'nikov [352, 353] for massive fields in Kerr spacetime, Anderson Hiscock and Samuel [342, 343]\nfor a general (arbitrary curvature coupling and mass) scalar field in a general static spherically\nsymmetric spacetime and have applied their method to the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m geometry [344].\nThough arduous and demanding, the effort continues on because of its importance in finding the\nbackreaction effects of Hawking radiation on the evolution of black holes and the quantum structure\nof spacetime.\nHere we wish to address the black hole backreaction problem with new insights and methods\nprovided by stochastic gravity. (For the latest developments see reviews, e.g., [101, 2, 3, 4]). It is\nnot our intention to seek better approximations for the regularized energy momentum tensor, but\nto point out new ingredients lacking in the existing semiclassical gravity framework. In particular\none needs to consider both the dissipation and the fluctuations aspects in the back reaction of\nparticle creation or vacuum polarization.\nIn a short note Hu, Raval and Sinha [140] first used the stochastic gravity formalism to address\nthe backreaction of evaporating black holes. A more detailed analysis is given by the recent work\nof Hu and Roura [143, 354] For the class of quasi-static black holes, the formulation of the problem\nin this new light was sketched out by Sinha Raval and Hu [142]. We follow these two latter works\nin the stochastic gravity theory approach to the black hole fluctuations and backreaction problems.\n8.1.2\n\nBackreaction and Fluctuation-Dissipation relation\n\nFrom the statistical field theory perspective provided by stochastic gravity one can understand that\nbackreaction effect is the manifestation of a fluctuation-dissipation relation [355, 356, 357, 358, 359,\n360]. This was first conjectured by Candelas and Sciama [97, 138, 139] for a dynamic Kerr black hole\nemitting Hawking radiation, and Mottola [98] for a static black hole (in a box) in quasi-equilibrium\nwith its radiation via linear response theory [361, 362, 363, 364, 365]. This postulate was shown to\n62\n\n\fhold for fully dynamical spacetimes. From cosmological backreaction problem Hu and Sinha [99]\nderived a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation relating dissipation (of anisotropy in Bianchi\nType I universes) and fluctuations (measured by particle numbers created in neighboring histories).\nWhile the fluctuation-dissipation relation in a linear response theory captures the response of the\nsystem (e.g., dissipation of the black hole) to the environment (in these cases the quantum matter\nfield) linear response theory (in the way it is commonly presented in statistical thermodynamics)\ncannot provide a full description of self-consistent backreaction on at least two counts:\nFirst, because it is usually based on the assumption of a specified background spacetime (static\nin this case) and state (thermal) of the matter field(s) (e.g., [98]). The spacetime and the state of\nmatter should be determined in a self-consistent manner by their dynamics and mutual influence.\nSecond, the fluctuation part represented by the noise kernel is amiss (e.g., [205, 113]) This is also\na problem in the fluctuation-dissipation relation proposed by Candelas and Sciama [97, 138, 139]\n(see below). As demonstrated by many authors [99, 104] backreaction is intrinsically a dynamic\nprocess. The Einstein-Langevin equation in stochastic gravity overcomes both of these deficiencies.\nFor Candelas and Sciama [97, 138, 139], the classical formula they showed relating the dissipation\nin area linearly to the squared absolute value of the shear amplitude is suggestive of a fluctuationdissipation relation. When the gravitational perturbations are quantized (they choose the quantum\nstate to be the Unruh vacuum) they argue that it approximates a flux of radiation from the hole\nat large radii. Thus the dissipation in area due to the Hawking flux of gravitational radiation is\nallegedly related to the quantum fluctuations of gravitons. The criticism in Ref. [140] is that their's\nis not a fluctuation-dissipation relation in the truly statistical mechanical sense because it does not\nrelate dissipation of a certain quantity (in this case, horizon area) to the fluctuations of the same\nquantity. To do so would require one to compute the two point function of the area, which, being a\nfour-point function of the graviton field, is related to a two-point function of the stress tensor. The\nstress tensor is the true \"generalized force\" acting on the spacetime via the equations of motion,\nand the dissipation in the metric must eventually be related to the fluctuations of this generalized\nforce for the relation to qualify as a fluctuation-dissipation relation.\n8.1.3\n\nNoise and Fluctuations \u2013 the missing ingredient in older treatment\n\nFrom this reasoning, we see that the vacuum expectation value of the stress energy bi-tensor,\nknown as the noise kernel, is the necessary new ingredient in addition to the dissipation kernel, and\nstochastic gravity as an extension of semiclasical gravity is the appropriate framework for backreaction considerations. The noise kernel for quantum fields in Minkowski and de Sitter spacetime\nhas been carried out by Martin, Roura and Verdaguer [5, 109, 134], for thermal fields in black hole\nspacetime and scalar fields in general spacetimes by Campos, Hu and Phillips [100, 141, 7, 8].\n\n8.2\n\nBackreaction on black holes under quasi-static conditions\n\nAs an illustration of the application of stochastic gravity theory we outline the essential steps in a\nblack hole backreaction calculation, focusing on a more manageable quasi-static class. We adopt\nthe Hartle-Hawking picture [366] where the black hole is bathed eternally \u2013 actually in quasithermal equilibrium \u2013 in the Hawking radiance it emits. It is described here by a massless scalar\nquantum field at the Hawking temperature. As is well-known, this quasi-equilibrium condition is\npossible only if the black hole is enclosed in a box of size suitably larger than the event horizon.\nWe can divide our consideration into the far field case and the near horizon case. Campos and Hu\n63\n\n\f[100, 141] have treated a relativistic thermal plasma in a weak gravitational field. Since the far\nfield limit of a Schwarzschild metric is just the perturbed Minkowski spacetime, one can perform a\nperturbation expansion off hot flat space using the thermal Green functions [367]. Strictly speaking\nthe location of the box holding the black hole in equilibrium with its thermal radiation is as far\nas one can go, thus the metric may not reach the perturbed Minkowski form. But one can also\nput the black hole and its radiation in an anti-de Sitter space [368], which contains such a region.\nHot flat space has been studied before for various purposes. See e.g., [369, 370, 371, 372, 373].\nCampos and Hu derived a stochastic CTP effective action and from it an equation of motion, the\nEinstein Langevin equation, for the dynamical effect of a scalar quantum field on a background\nspacetime. To perform calculations leading to the Einstein-Langevin equation one needs to begin\nwith a self-consistent solution of the semiclassical Einstein equation for the thermal field and the\nperturbed background spacetime. For a black hole background, a semiclassical gravity solution is\nprovided by York [233, 234, 235]. For a Robertson-Walker background with thermal fields it is\ngiven by Hu [374].\nWe follow the strategy outlined by Sinha, Raval and Hu [142] for treating the near horizon\ncase, following the same scheme of Campos and Hu. In both cases two new terms appear which are\nabsent in semiclassical gravity considerations: a nonlocal dissipation and a (generally colored) noise\nkernel. When one takes the noise average one recovers York's [233, 234, 235] semiclassical equations\nfor radially perturbed quasi-static black holes. For the near horizon case one cannot obtain the full\ndetails yet, because the Green function for a scalar field in the Schwarzschild metric comes only in\nan approximate form (e.g. Page approximation [348]), which, though reasonably accurate for the\nstress tensor, fails poorly for the noise kernel [8]. In addition a formula is derived in [142] expressing\nthe CTP effective action in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. Since it measures not only the\nnumber of particles created, but also the difference of particle creation in alternative histories, this\nprovides a useful avenue to explore the wider set of issues in black hole physics related to noise and\nfluctuations.\nSince backreaction calculations in semiclassical gravity has been under study for a much longer\ntime than in stochastic gravity we will concentrate on explaining how the new stochastic features\narise from the framework of semiclassical gravity, i.e., noise and fluctuations and their consequences. Technically the goal is to obtain an influence action for this model of a black hole coupled\nto a scalar field and to derive an Einstein-Langevin equation from it. As a by-product, from the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, one can derive the vacuum susceptibility function and the isothermal compressibility function for black holes, two quantities of fundamental interest in characterizing\nthe nonequilibrium thermodynamic properties of black holes.\n8.2.1\n\nThe model\n\nIn this model the black hole spacetime is described by a spherically symmetric static metric with line\nelement of the following general form written in advanced time Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates\n\u0012\n\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u2212e2\u03c8 1 \u2212\n\n2m\ndv 2 + 2e2\u03c8 dvdr + r 2 d\u03a92 ,\nr\n\u0013\n\n(8.1)\n\nr\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03c8(r) and m = m(r) , v = t + r + 2M ln 2M\n\u2212 1 and d\u03a92 is the line element on the two\nsphere. Hawking radiation is described by a massless, conformally coupled quantum scalar field \u03c6\n\n\u0001\n\n64\n\n\fwith the classical action\n1\nSm [\u03c6, g\u03bc\u03bd ] = \u2212\n2\n\n\u221a\ndn x \u2212g[g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + \u03be(n)R\u03c62 ],\n\nZ\n\n(8.2)\n\n(n\u22122)\n(n is the dimension of spacetime) and R is the curvature scalar of the spacetime\nwhere \u03be(n) = 4(n\u22121)\nit lives in.\n(0)\nLet us consider linear perturbations h\u03bc\u03bd off a background Schwarzschild metric g\u03bc\u03bd\n(0)\ng\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd\n+ h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(8.3)\n\nwith standard line element\n\u0012\n\n(ds2 )0 = 1 \u2212\n\n2M\nr\n\n\u0013\n\ndv 2 + 2dvdr + r 2 d\u03a92 .\n\n(8.4)\n\nWe look for this class of perturbed metrics in the form given by (8.1), (thus restricting our consideration only to spherically symmetric perturbations):\ne\u03c8 \u2243 1 + \u01eb\u03c1(r),\n\n(8.5)\n\nm \u2243 M [1 + \u01eb\u03bc(r)],\n\n(8.6)\n\nand\n2\n\n\u03c0\n1\n\u01eb\n4\n4 2\nwhere \u03bbM\n2 = 3 aTH ; a = 30 ; \u03bb = 90(8 )\u03c0 . TH is the Hawking temperature. This particular\nparametrization of the perturbation is chosen following York's [233, 234, 235] notation. Thus the\nonly non-zero components of h\u03bc\u03bd are\n\nhvv\n\n2M \u01eb\u03bc(r)\n2M\n)2\u01eb\u03c1(r) +\n,\n= \u2212 (1 \u2212\nr\nr\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(8.7)\n\nand\nhvr = \u01eb\u03c1(r).\n\n(8.8)\n\nSo this represents a metric with small static and radial perturbations about a Schwarzschild black\nhole. The initial quantum state of the scalar field is taken to be the Hartle Hawking vacuum, which\nis essentially a thermal state at the Hawking temperature and it represents a black hole in (unstable)\nthermal equilibrium with its own Hawking radiation. In the far field limit, the gravitational field\nis described by a linear perturbation from Minkowski spacetime. In equilibrium the thermal bath\ncan be characterized by a relativistic fluid with a four-velocity (time-like normalized vector field)\nu\u03bc , and temperature in its own rest frame \u03b2 \u22121 .\nTo facilitate later comparisons with our program we briefly recall York's work [233, 234, 235].\nSee also work by Hochberg and Kephart [299] for a massless vector field, Hochberg, Kephart and\nYork [300] for a massless spinor field, and Anderson, Hiscock, Whitesell, and York [301] for a\nquantized massless scalar field with arbitrary coupling to spacetime curvature. York considered the\nsemiclassical Einstein equation\nG\u03bc\u03bd (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) = \u03bahT\u03bc\u03bd i,\n(8.9)\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nwith G\u03bc\u03bd \u2243 G\u03bc\u03bd +\u03b4G\u03bc\u03bd where G\u03bc\u03bd is the Einstein tensor for the background spacetime. The zeroth\norder solution gives a background metric in empty space, i.e, the Schwarzschild metric. \u03b4G\u03bc\u03bd is\n65\n\n\fthe linear correction to the Einstein tensor in the perturbed metric. The semiclassical Einstein\nequation in this approximation therefore reduces to\n\u03b4G\u03bc\u03bd (g(0) , h) = \u03bahT\u03bc\u03bd i.\n\n(8.10)\n\nYork solved this equation to first order by using the expectation value of the energy momentum\ntensor for a conformally coupled scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in the unperturbed\n(Schwarzschild) spacetime on the right hand side and using (8.7) and (8.8) to calculate \u03b4G\u03bc\u03bd on\nthe left hand side. Unfortunately, no exact analytical expression is available for the hT\u03bc\u03bd i in a\nSchwarzschild metric with the quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum that goes on the right\nhand side. York therefore uses the approximate expression given by Page [348] which is known\nto give excellent agreement with numerical results. Page's approximate expression for hT\u03bc\u03bd i was\nconstructed using a thermal Feynman Green's function obtained by a conformal transformation of\na WKB approximated Green's function for an optical Schwarzschild metric. York then solves the\nsemiclassical Einstein equation (8.10) self consistently to obtain the corrections to the background\nmetric induced by the backreaction encoded in the functions \u03bc(r) and \u03c1(r). There was no mention of\nfluctuations or its effects. As we shall see, in the language of the previous section, the semiclassical\ngravity procedure which York followed working at the equation of motion level is equivalent to\nlooking at the noise-averaged backreaction effects.\n8.2.2\n\nCTP Effective Action for the Black Hole\n\nWe first derive the CTP effective action for the model described in the previous section. Using the\nmetric (8.4) (and neglecting the surface terms that appear in an integration by parts) we have the\naction for the scalar field written perturbatively as\nSm [\u03c6, h\u03bc\u03bd ] =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nh\n\ni\n\ndn x \u2212g(0) \u03c6 \u2737(0) + V (1) + V (2) + * * * \u03c6,\n\n(8.11)\n\nwhere the first and second order perturbative operators V (1) and V (2) are given by\n1\nV (1)\u2261\u2212 q\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212g(0) h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd + h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd +\u03be(n)R(1) ,\n\u2212g (0)\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u001a \u0012q\n1\n1\nV (2)\u2261\u2212q\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212g(0) \u0125\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd + \u0125\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2212\u03be(n)(R(2) + hR(1) ) .\n2\n\u2212g (0)\n\u001a\n\n\u0012q\n\n\u0013\n\n\u001b\n\n(8.12)\n\nIn the above expressions, R(k) is the k-order term in the perturbation h\u03bc\u03bd (x) of the scalar curvature\nR and h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd and \u0125\u03bc\u03bd denote a linear and a quadratic combination of the perturbation, respectively,\nh\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\n\u0125\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1 (0)\n,\n\u2261 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 hg\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n1\n1\n1\n(0)\n(0)\n\u2261 h\u03bc\u03b1 h\u03b1\u03bd \u2212 hh\u03bc\u03bd + h2 g\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 h\u03b1\u03b2 h\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03bc\u03bd\n.\n2\n8\n4\n\n(8.13)\n\nFrom quantum field theory in curved spacetime considerations discussed above we take the following\naction for the gravitational field:\nSg [g\u03bc\u03bd ]=\n\n1\n(16\u03c0G)\n\nn\u22122\n2\n\nZ\n\ndn x\n\nq\n\n\u2212g(x)R(x) +\n66\n\n\u03b1\u03bc\u0304n\u22124\n4(n \u2212 4)\n\nZ\n\ndn x\n\nq\n\n\u2212g(x)\n\n\f(\n\n\u00d7 3R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 (x)R\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\"\n\n1\n(x)\u2212 1\u2212360 \u03be(n)\u2212\n6\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 #\n\n2\n\n)\n\nR (x) .\n\n(8.14)\n\nThe first term is the classical Einstein-Hilbert action and the second term is the counterterm in\nfour dimensions used to renormalize the divergent effective action.

Note that the addition of the contribution of other kinds of matter fields to the\neffective action, even graviton contributions, does not change the tensor structure of these kernels\nand only the overall factors are different to leading order [370, 371].

The Hi (r)\ncoefficients were first given in [370, 371] and generalized to the next-to-leading order (\u03b2 \u22122 ) in\n[372, 373]. (They are given with the MTW sign convention in [100, 141].)\nFinally, as defined above, N\u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x) is the noise kernel representing the random fluctuations of\nthe thermal radiance and D\u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x) is the dissipation kernel, describing the dissipation of energy\nof the gravitational field.\n8.2.4\n\nNear Horizon Case\n\nIn this case, since the perturbation is taken around the Schwarzschild spacetime, exact expressions\nfor the corresponding unperturbed propagators G\u03b2ab [h\u00b1\n\u03bc\u03bd ] are not known. Therefore apart from the\napproximation of computing the CTP effective action to certain order in perturbation theory, an\nappropriate approximation scheme for the unperturbed Green's functions is also required. This\nfeature manifested itself in York's calculation of backreaction as well, where, in writing the hT\u03bc\u03bd i\non the right hand side of the semiclassical Einstein equation in the unperturbed Schwarzschild\nmetric, he had to use an approximate expression for hT\u03bc\u03bd i in the Schwarzschild metric given by\nPage [348]. The additional complication here is that while to obtain hT\u03bc\u03bd i as in York's calculation,\nthe knowledge of only the thermal Feynman Green's function is required, to calculate the CTP\neffective action one needs the knowledge of the full matrix propagator, which involves the Feynman,\nSchwinger and Wightman functions.\n70\n\n\fIt is indeed possible to construct the full thermal matrix propagator G\u03b2ab [h\u00b1\n\u03bc\u03bd ] based on Page's\napproximate Feynman Green's function by using identities relating the Feynman Green's function\nwith the other Green's functions with different boundary conditions. One can then proceed to\nexplicitly compute a CTP effective action and hence the influence functional based on this approximation. However, we desist from delving into such a calculation for the following reason. Our\nmain interest in performing such a calculation is to identify and analyze the noise term which is\nthe new ingredient in the backreaction. We have mentioned that the noise term gives a stochastic\ncontribution \u03be \u03bc\u03bd to the Einstein-Langevin equation (3.14). We had also stated that this term is\n2 i. However, a calculation of\nrelated to the variance of fluctuations in T\u03bc\u03bd , i.e, schematically, to hT\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nhT\u03bc\u03bd i in the Hartle-Hawking state in a Schwarzschild background using the Page approximation was\nperformed by Phillips and Hu [7, 8] and it was shown that though the approximation is excellent as\n2 i at the horizon. In fact, similar\nfar as hT\u03bc\u03bd i is concerned, it gives unacceptably large errors for hT\u03bc\u03bd\nerrors will be propagated in the non-local dissipation term as well, because both terms originate\nfrom the same source, that is, they come from the last trace term in (8.17) which contains terms\nquadratic in the Green's function. However, the Influence Functional or CTP formalism itself does\nnot depend on the nature of the approximation, so we will attempt to exhibit the general structure\nof the calculation without resorting to a specific form for the Greens function and conjecture on\nwhat is to be expected. A more accurate computation can be performed using this formal structure\nonce a better approximation becomes available.\nThe general structure of the CTP effective action arising from the calculation of the traces in\nequation (8.17) remains the same. But to write down explicit expressions for the non-local kernels\none requires the input of the explicit form of G\u03b2ab [h\u00b1\n\u03bc\u03bd ] in the Schwarzschild metric, which is not\navailable in closed form. We can make some general observations about the terms in there. The\nfirst line containing L does not have an explicit Fourier representation as given in the far field\n\u03bc\u03bd\nin the second line representing the zeroth order contribution to hT\u03bc\u03bd i have\ncase, neither will T(\u03b2)\na perfect fluid form. The third and fourth terms containing the remaining quadratic component\nof the real part of the effective action will not have any simple or even complicated analytic form.\nThe symmetry properties of the kernels H \u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 ) and D \u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 ) remain intact, i.e., they are\nrespectively even and odd in x, x\u2032 . The last term in the CTP effective action gives the imaginary\npart of the effective action and the kernel N (x, x\u2032 ) is symmetric.\nContinuing our general observations from this CTP effective action, using the connection between this thermal CTP effective action to the influence functional [18, 102] via an equation in the\nschematic form (4.3). We see that the nonlocal imaginary term containing the kernel N \u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 )\nis responsible for the generation of the stochastic noise term in the Einstein-Langevin equation\nand the real non-local term containing kernel D \u03bc\u03bd,\u03b1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 ) is responsible for the non-local dissipation term. To derive the Einstein-Langevin equation we first construct the stochastic effective\naction (4.13). We then derive the equation of motion, as shown earlier in (4.15), by taking its\nfunctional derivative with respect to [h\u03bc\u03bd ] and equating it to zero. With the identification of noise\nand dissipation kernels, one can write down a linear, non-local relation of the form,\nN (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd(s \u2212 s\u2032 )K(t \u2212 t\u2032 , s \u2212 s\u2032 )\u03b3(s \u2212 s\u2032 ),\n\n(8.30)\n\nwhere D(t, t\u2032 ) = \u2212\u2202t\u2032 \u03b3(t, t\u2032 ). This is the general functional form of a fluctuation-dissipation relation and K(t, s) is called the fluctuation-dissipation kernel [375, 376, 377, 378]. In the present\ncontext this relation depicts the backreaction of thermal Hawking radiance for a black hole in\n71\n\n\fquasi-equilibrium.\n8.2.5\n\nEinstein-Langevin equation\n\nIn this section we show how a semiclassical Einstein-Langevin equation can be derived from the\nprevious thermal CTP effective action. This equation depicts the stochastic evolution of the perturbations of the black hole under the influence of the fluctuations of the thermal scalar field.\nThe influence functional FIF \u2261 exp(iSIF ) previously introduced in Eq. (4.2) can be written\n\u03b2\n[h\u00b1\nin terms of the the CTP effective action Seff\n\u03bc\u03bd ] derived in equation (8.22) using Eq. (4.3). The\nEinstein-Langevin equation follows from taking the functional derivative of the stochastic effective\naction (4.13) with respect to [h\u03bc\u03bd ](x) and imposing [h\u03bc\u03bd ](x) = 0.

Note that this differential stochastic equation includes a non-local term responsible for the\ndissipation of the gravitational field and a noise source term which accounts for the fluctuations\nof the quantum field . Note also that this equation in combination with the correlation for the\nstochastic variable (8.32) determine the two-point correlation for the stochastic metric fluctuations\nhh\u0304\u03bc\u03bd (x)h\u0304\u03b1\u03b2 (x\u2032 )i\u03be self-consistently.\nAs we have seen before and here, the Einstein-Langevin equation is a dynamical equation\ngoverning the dissipative evolution of the gravitational field under the influence of the fluctuations\nof the quantum field, which, in the case of black holes, takes the form of thermal radiance. From\nits form we can see that even for the quasi-static case under study the back reaction of Hawking\nradiation on the black hole spacetime has an innate dynamical nature.\nFor the far field case making use of the explicit forms available for the noise and dissipation\nkernels Campos and Hu [100, 141] formally proved the existence of a fluctuation-dissipation relation\nat all temperatures between the quantum fluctuations of the thermal radiance and the dissipation of\nthe gravitational field. They also showed the formal equivalence of this method with linear response\n72\n\n\ftheory for lowest order perturbations of a near-equilibrium system, and how the response functions\nsuch as the contribution of the quantum scalar field to the thermal graviton polarization tensor\ncan be derived. An important quantity not usually obtained in linear response theory, but of equal\nimportance, manifest in the CTP stochastic approach is the noise term arising from the quantum\nand statistical fluctuations in the thermal field. The example given in this section shows that the\nback reaction is intrinsically a dynamic process described (at this level of sophistication) by the\nEinstein-Langevin equation. By comparison, traditional linear response theory calculations cannot\ncapture the dynamics as fully and thus cannot provide a complete description of the backreaction\nproblem.\n8.2.6\n\nComments\n\nAs remarked earlier, except for the near-flat case, an analytic form of the Green function is not\navailable. Even the Page approximation [348] which gives unexpectedly good results for the stress\nenergy tensor has been shown to fail in the fluctuations of the energy density [8]. Thus using such an\napproximation for the noise kernel will give unreliable results for the Einstein-Langevin equation.\nIf we confine ourselves to Page's approximation and derive the equation of motion without the\nstochastic term, we expect to recover York's semiclassical Einstein's equation if one retains only\nthe zeroth order contribution, i.e, the first two terms in the expression for the CTP effective action\nin Eq. (8.22). Thus, this offers a new route to arrive at York's semiclassical Einstein's equations.\n(Not only is it a derivation of York's result from a different point of view, but it also shows how\nhis result arises as an appropriate limit of a more complete framework, i.e, it arises when one\naverages over the noise.) Another point worth noting is that a non-local dissipation term arises\nfrom the fourth term in Eq. (8.22) in the CTP effective action which is absent in York's treatment.\nThis difference exists primarily due to the difference in the way backreaction is treated, at the\nlevel of iterative approximations on the equation of motion as in York, versus the treatment at\nthe effective action level as in the influence functional approach. In York's treatment, the Einstein\ntensor is computed to first order in perturbation theory, while hT\u03bc\u03bd i on the right hand side of the\nsemiclassical Einstein equation is replaced by the zeroth order term. In the influence functional\ntreatment the full effective action is computed to second order in perturbation, and hence includes\nthe higher order non-local terms.\nThe other important conceptual point that comes to light from this new approach is that\nrelated to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation. In the quantum Brownian motion analog (e.g.,\n[375, 376, 377, 378] and references therein), the dissipation of the energy of the Brownian particle\nas it approaches equilibrium and the fluctuations at equilibrium are connected by the FluctuationDissipation relation. Here the backreaction of quantum fields on black holes also consists of two\nforms \u2013 dissipation and fluctuation or noise \u2013 corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of\nthe influence functional as embodied in the dissipation and noise kernels. A fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation has been shown to exist for the near flat case by Campos and Hu [100, 141] and is expected\nto exist between the noise and dissipation kernels for the general case, as it is a categorical relation\n[375, 376, 377, 378, 101]. Martin and Verdaguer have also proved the existence of a fluctuationdissipation relation when the semiclassical background is a stationary spacetime and the quantum\nfield is in thermal equilibrium. Their result was then extended to a conformal field in a conformally\nstationary background [5]. As discussed earlier the existence of a fluctuation-dissipation relation for\nthe black hole case has been suggested by some authors previously [97, 138, 139, 98]. This relation\n\n73\n\n\fand the relevant physical quantities contained therein, such as the black hole susceptibility function\nwhich characterizes the statistical mechanical and dynamical responses of a black hole interacting\nwith its quantum field environment, will allow us to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamic\nproperties of the black hole, and through it perhaps the microscopic structure of spacetime.\nThere are limitations of a technical nature in the quasi-static case studied, as mentioned above,\ni.e., there is no reliable approximation to the Schwarzschild thermal Green's function to explicitly\ncompute the noise and dissipation kernels. Another technical limitation of this example is the\nfollowing. Although we have allowed for backreaction effects to modify the initial state in the sense\nthat the temperature of the Hartle-Hawking state gets affected by the backreaction, our analysis is\nessentially confined to a Hartle-Hawking thermal state of the field. It does not directly extend to\na more general class of states, for example to the case where the initial state of the field is in the\nUnruh vacuum. To study the dynamics of a radiating black hole under the influence of a quantum\nfield and its fluctuations a different model and approach are needed which we now discuss.\n\n8.3\n\nMetric Fluctuations of an Evaporating Black Hole\n\nAt the semiclassical gravity level of description, black hole evaporation results from the backreaction\nof particle production in Hawking effect. This is believed to be valid at least before the Planckian\nscale is reached [298, 341]. However, as is explained above, semiclassical gravity [32, 34, 229] is\na mean field description that neglects the fluctuations of the spacetime geometry. A number of\nstudies have suggested the existence of large fluctuations near black hole horizons [380, 123, 381,\n382] (and even instabilities [383]) with characteristic time-scales much shorter than the black hole\nevaporation time. For example, Casher et al [381] and Sorkin [123, 124] have concentrated on the\nissue of fluctuations of the horizon induced by a fluctuating metric. Casher et al [381] considers\nthe fluctuations of the horizon induced by the \"atmosphere\" of high angular momentum particles\nnear the horizon, while Sorkin [123, 124] calculates fluctuations of the shape of the horizon induced\nby the quantum field fluctuations under a Newtonian approximations. A relativistic generalization\nof this vein is given by Marolf [382]. Both groups of authors came to the conclusion that horizon\nfluctuations become large at scales much larger than the Planck scale (note Ford and Svaiter [121]\nlater presented results contrary to this claim). Though these works do deal with backreaction, the\nfluctuations considered do not arise as an explicit stochastic noise term as in stochastic gravity.\nEither states which are singular on the horizon (such as the Boulware vacuum for Schwarzschild\nspacetime) were explicitly considered, or fluctuations were computed with respect to those states\nand found to be large near the horizon. Whether these huge fluctuations are of a generic nature or\nan artifact from the consideration of states singular on the horizon is an issue that deserves further\ninvestigation. By contrast, the fluctuations for states regular on the horizon were estimated in\nRef. [122] and found to be small even when integrated over a time of the order of the evaporation\ntime. These apparently contradictory claims and the fact that most claims on black hole horizon\nfluctuations were based on qualitative arguments and/or semi-quantitative estimates indicate that\na more quantitative and self-consistent description is needed. This is what stochastic gravity theory\ncan provide.\nSuch a program of research has been pursued rigorously by Hu and Roura (HR) [144, 354] In\ncontrast to the claims made before, they find that even for states regular on the horizon the accumulated fluctuations become significant by the time the black hole mass has changed substantially,\nbut well before reaching the Planckian regime. This result is different from those obtained in prior\n\n74\n\n\fstudies, but in agreement with earlier work by Bekenstein [384]. The apparent difference from\nthe conclusions drawn in the earlier work of Hu, Raval and Sinha [140], which was also based on\nstochastic gravity, will be explained later. We begin with the evolution of the mean geometry.\n8.3.1\n\nEvolution of Mean Geometry of an Evaporating Black Hole\n\nBackreaction of the Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole on the dynamics of spacetime\ngeometry has been studied in some detail for spherically symmetric black holes [298, 341]. For a\ngeneral spherically-symmetric metric there always exists a system of coordinates in which it takes\nthe form\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03c8(v,r) (1 \u2212 2m(v, r)/r)dv 2 + 2e\u03c8(v,r) dvdr + r 2 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 .\n\n(8.35)\n\nIn general this metric exhibits an apparent horizon, where the expansion of the outgoing radial\nnull geodesics vanishes and which separates regions with positive and negative expansion for those\ngeodesics, at those radii that correspond to (odd degree) zeroes of the vv metric component. We\nmark the location of the apparent horizon by rAH (v) = 2M (v), where M (v) satisfies the equation\n2m(2M (v), v) = 2M (v).\nThe non-zero components of the semiclassical Einstein equation associated with the metric in\nEq. (8.35) become\n\u2202m\n\u2202v\n\u2202m\n\u2202r\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202r\n\n= 4\u03c0r 2 hTvr i,\n\n(8.36)\n\n= \u22124\u03c0r 2 hTvv i,\n\n(8.37)\n\n= 4\u03c0rhTrr i,\n\n(8.38)\n\nwhere in the above and henceforth we use hT\u03bc\u03bd i to denote the renormalized or regularized vacuum\nexpectation value of the stress energy tensor hT\u0302\u03bc\u03bd [g]iren and employ Planckian units (with m2p = 1).\nSolving Eqs. (8.36)-(8.38) is not easy. However, one can introduce a useful adiabatic approximation in the regime where the mass of the black hole is much larger than the Planck mass, which\nis in any case a necessary condition for the semiclassical treatment to be valid. What this entails\nis that when M \u226b 1 (remember that we are using Planckian units) for each value of v one can\nsimply substitute hT\u03bc\u03bd i by its \"parametric value\" \u2013 by this we mean the expectation value of the\nstress energy tensor of the quantum field in a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass corresponding\nto M (v) evaluated at that value of v. This is in contrast to its dynamical value, which should be\ndetermined by solving self-consistently the semiclassical Einstein equation for the spacetime metric\nand the equations of motion for the quantum matter fields. This kind of approximation introduces\nerrors of higher order in LH \u2261 B/M 2 (B is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the number\nof massless fields and their spins and accounts for their corresponding grey-body factors; it has\nbeen estimated to be of order 10\u22124 [385]), which are very small for black holes well above Planckian\nscales. These errors are due to the fact that M (v) is not constant and that, even for a constant\nM (v), the resulting static geometry is not exactly Schwarzschild because the vacuum polarization\nof the quantum fields gives rise to a non-vanishing hT\u0302ab [g]iren [234].\nThe expectation value of the stress tensor for Schwarzschild spacetime has been found to correspond to a thermal flux of radiation (with hTvr i = LH /(4\u03c0r 2 )) for large radii and of order LH near\n75\n\n\fthe horizon [386, 348, 345, 346, 343]. This shows the consistency of the adiabatic approximation\nfor LH \u226a 1: the right-hand side of Eqs. (8.36)-(8.38) contains terms of order LH and higher, so\nthat the derivatives of m(v, r) and \u03c8(v, r) are indeed small. We note that the natural quantum\nstate for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse is the Unruh vacuum, which corresponds to\nthe absence of incoming radiation far from the horizon. The expectation value of the stress tensor\noperator for that state is finite on the future horizon of Schwarzschild, which is the relevant one\nwhen identifying a region of the Schwarzschild geometry with the spacetime outside the collapsing\nmatter for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse.\nOne can use the v component of the stress-energy conservation equation\n\u2202hTvv i\n\u2202 r 2 hTvr i\n+ r2\n= 0,\n\u2202r\n\u2202v\n\u0001\n\n(8.39)\n\nto relate the hTvr i components on the horizon and far from it. Integrating Eq. (8.39) radially, one\ngets\n(r 2 hTvr i)(r = 2M (v), v) = (r 2 hTvr i)(r \u2248 6M (v), v) + O(L2H ),\n(8.40)\nwhere we considered a radius sufficiently far from the horizon, but not arbitrarily far (i.e. 2M (v) \u226a\nr \u226a M (v)/LH ).Hence, Eq. (8.40) relates the positive energy flux radiated away far from the\nhorizon and the negative energy flux crossing the horizon. Taking into account this connection\nbetween energy fluxes and evaluating Eq. (8.36) on the apparent horizon, we finally get the equation\ngoverning the evolution of its size:\nB\ndM\n= \u2212 2.\n(8.41)\ndv\nM\nUnless M (v) is constant, the event horizon and the apparent horizon do not coincide. However,\nin the adiabatic regime their radii are related, differing by a quantity of higher order in LH :\nrEH (v) = rAH (v) (1 + O(LH )).\n8.3.2\n\nSpherically-symmetric induced fluctuations\n\nWe now consider metric fluctuations around a background metric gab that corresponds to a given\nsolution of semiclassical gravity. Their dynamics is governed by the Einstein-Langevin equation\n[103, 99, 104, 107]\nE\nD\n(1)\n(1)\n+ \u03ba \u03beab [g] ,\n(8.42)\nGab [g + h] = \u03ba T\u0302ab [g + h]\nren\n\n(The superindex (1) indicates that only the terms linear in the metric perturbations should be\nconsidered) Here \u03beab is a Gaussian stochastic source with vanishing expectation value and correlation\nfunction h\u03beab (x)\u03becd (x\u2032 )i\u03be = (1/2)h{t\u0302ab (x), t\u0302cd (x\u2032 )}i (with t\u0302ab \u2261 T\u0302ab \u2212hT\u0302ab i), known as the noise kernel\nand denoted by Nabcd (x, x\u2032 ).\nAs explained earlier the symmetrized two-point function consists of two contributions: intrinsic\nand induced fluctuations. The intrinsic fluctuations are a consequence of the quantum width of the\ninitial state of the metric perturbations, and they are obtained in stochastic gravity by averaging\nover the initial conditions for the solutions of the homogeneous part of Eq. (8.42) distributed\naccording to the reduced Wigner function associated with the initial quantum state of the metric\nperturbations. On the other hand, the induced fluctuations are due to the quantum fluctuations of\nthe matter fields interacting with the metric perturbations, and they are obtained by solving the\nEinstein-Langevin equation using a retarded propagator with vanishing initial conditions.\n76\n\n\fIn this section we study the spherically-symmetric sector [i.e., the monopole contribution, which\ncorresponds to l = 0, in a multipole expansion in terms of spherical harmonics Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)] of metric\nfluctuations for an evaporating black hole. Restricting one's attention to the spherically-symmetric\nsector of metric fluctuations necessarily implies a partial description of the fluctuations because,\ncontrary to the case for semiclassical gravity solutions, even if one starts with spherically-symmetric\ninitial conditions, the stress tensor fluctuations will induce fluctuations involving higher multipoles.\nThus, the multipole structure of the fluctuations is far richer than that of spherically-symmetric\nsemiclassical gravity solutions, but this also means that obtaining a complete solution (including\nall multipoles) for fluctuations rather than the mean value is much more difficult. For spherically\nsymmetric fluctuations only induced fluctuations are possible. The fact that intrinsic fluctuations\ncannot exist can be clearly seen if one neglects vacuum polarization effects, since Birkhoff's theorem\nforbids the existence of spherically-symmetric free metric perturbations in the exterior vacuum\nregion of a spherically-symmetric black hole that keep the ADM mass constant. (This fact rings\nan alarm in the approach taken in Ref. [387] to the black hole fluctuation problem. The degrees of\nfreedom corresponding to spherically-symmetric perturbations are constrained by the Hamiltonian\nand momentum constraints both at the classical and quantum level. Therefore, they will not\nexhibit quantum fluctuations unless they are coupled to a quantum matter field.) Even when\nvacuum polarization effects are included, spherically-symmetric perturbations, characterized by\nm(v, r) and \u03c8(v, r), are not independent degrees of freedom. This follows from Eqs. (8.36)-(8.38),\nwhich can be regarded as constraint equations.\nConsidering only spherical symmetry fluctuations is a simplification but it should be emphasized\nthat it gives more accurate results than two-dimensional dilaton-gravity models resulting from\nsimple dimensional reduction [388, 389, 390]. This is because we project the solutions of the\nEinstein-Langevin equation just at the end, rather than considering only the contribution of the\ns-wave modes to the classical action for both the metric and the matter fields from the very\nbeginning. Hence, an infinite number of modes for the matter fields with l 6= 0 contribute to the\nl = 0 projection of the noise kernel, whereas only the s-wave modes for each matter field would\ncontribute to the noise kernel if dimensional reduction had been imposed right from the start, as\ndone in Refs. [128, 391, 392] as well as in studies of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity models.\nThe Einstein-Langevin equation for the spherically-symmetric sector of metric perturbations can\nbe obtained by considering linear perturbations of m(v, r) and \u03c8(v, r), projecting the stochastic\nsource that accounts for the stress tensor fluctuations to the l = 0 sector, and adding it to the\nright-hand side of Eqs. (8.36)-(8.38). We will focus our attention on the equation for the evolution\nof \u03b7(v, r), the perturbation of m(v, r):\n\u0010\n\u0011\nB\n\u2202(m + \u03b7)\n2 r\n2\n=\u2212\n+\n4\u03c0r\n\u03be\n+\nO\nL\n,\nv\nH\n\u2202v\n(m + \u03b7)2\n\n(8.43)\n\nwhich reduces, after neglecting terms of order L2H or higher, to the following equation to linear\norder in \u03b7:\n\u2202\u03b7\n2B\n= 3 \u03b7 + 4\u03c0r 2 \u03bevr .\n(8.44)\n\u2202v\nm\nIt is important to emphasize that in Eq. (8.43) we assumed that the change in time of \u03b7(v, r) is\nsufficiently slow so that the adiabatic approximation employed in the previous section to obtain\nthe mean evolution of m(v, r) can also be applied to the perturbed quantity m(v, r) + \u03b7(v, r). This\n\n77\n\n\fis guaranteed as long as the term corresponding to the stochastic source is of order LH or higher,\na point which will be discussed below.\nA more serious issue raised by HR is that in most previous investigations [384, 122] of the\nproblem of metric fluctuations driven by quantum matter field fluctuations of states regular on the\nhorizon (as far as the expectation value of the stress tensor is concerned) most authors assumed the\nexistence of correlations between the outgoing energy flux far from the horizon and a negative energy\nflux crossing the horizon. (See, however, Refs. [391, 392], where those correlators were shown to\nvanish in an effectively two-dimensional model.) In semiclassical gravity, using energy conservation\narguments, such correlations have been confirmed for the expectation value of the energy fluxes,\nprovided that the mass of the black hole is much larger than the Planck mass. However, a more\ncareful analysis by HR shows that no such simple connection exists for energy flux fluctuations. It\nalso reveals that the fluctuations on the horizon are in fact divergent. This requires one modifies\nthe classical picture of the event horizon from a sharply defined three-dimensional hypersurface to\nthat possessing a finite width, i.e., a fluctuating geometry. One needs to find an appropriate way of\nprobing the metric fluctuations near the horizon and extracting physically meaningful information.\nIt also testifies to the necessity of a complete reexamination of all cases afresh and that an evaluation\nof the noise kernel near the horizon seems unavoidable for the consideration of fluctuations and\nback-reaction issues.\nHaving registered this cautionary note, Hu and Roura [354] first make the assumption that\na relation between the fluctuations of the fluxes exists, so as to be able to compare with earlier\nwork. They then show that this relation does not hold and discuss the essential elements required\nin understanding not only the mathematical theory but also the operational meaning of metric\nfluctuations.\nAssuming that there is a relation between fluctuations Since the generation of Hawking\nradiation is especially sensitive to what happens near the horizon, from now on we will concentrate\non the metric perturbations near the horizon and consider \u03b7(v) = \u03b7(v, 2M (v)). This means that\npossible effects on the Hawking radiation due to the fluctuations of the potential barrier for the\nradial mode functions will be missed by our analysis. Assuming that the fluctuations of the energy\nflux crossing the horizon and those far from it are exactly correlated, from Eq. (8.44) we have\n2B\nd\u03b7(v)\n= 3 \u03b7(v) + \u03be(v),\ndv\nM (v)\n\n(8.45)\n\nwhere \u03be(v) \u2261 (4\u03c0r 2 \u03bevr )(v, r \u2248 6M (v)). The correlation function for the spherically-symmetric\nfluctuation \u03be(v) is determined by the integral over the whole solid angle of the N rv rv component\nof the noise kernel, which is given by (1/2)h{t\u0302rv (x), t\u0302rv (x\u2032 )}i. The l = 0 fluctuations of the energy\nflux of Hawking radiation far from a black hole formed by gravitational collapse, characterized\nalso by (1/2)h{t\u0302rv (x), t\u0302rv (x\u2032 )}i averaged over the whole solid angle, have been studied in Ref. [122].\nIts main features are a correlation time of order M and a characteristic fluctuation amplitude of\norder \u01eb0 /M 4 (this is the result of smearing the stress tensor two-point function, which diverges\nin the coincidence limit, over a period of time of the order of the correlation time). The order\nof magnitude of \u01eb0 has been estimated to lie between 0.1B and B [384, 122]. For simplicity, we\nwill consider quantities smeared over a time of order M . We can then introduce the Markovian\napproximation (\u01eb0 /M 3 (v))\u03b4(v \u2212 v \u2032 ), which coarse-grains the information on features corresponding\n78\n\n\fto time-scales shorter than the correlation time M . Under those conditions r 2 \u03bevr is of order 1/M 2\nand thus the adiabatic approximation made when deriving Eq. (8.43) is justified.\nThe stochastic equation (8.45) for \u03b7 can be solved in the usual way and the correlation function\nfor \u03b7(v) can then be computed. Alternatively one can obtain an equation for h\u03b7 2 (v)i\u03be by first\nmultiplying Eq. (8.45) by \u03b7(v) and then taking the expectation value. This brings out a term\nh\u03b7(v)\u03be(v)i\u03be on the right hand side. For delta-correlated noise (the Stratonovich prescription is the\nappropriate one here), it is equal to one half the time-dependent coefficient multiplying the delta\nfunction \u03b4(v \u2212 v \u2032 ) in the correlator h\u03be(v)\u03be(v \u2032 )i\u03be , which is given by \u01eb0 /M 3 (v) in our case. Finally,\nchanging from the v coordinate to the mass function M (v) for the background solution, we obtain\n4\n(\u01eb0 /B)\nd\nh\u03b7 2 (M )i\u03be = \u2212 h\u03b7 2 (M )i\u03be \u2212\n.\ndM\nM\nM\n\n(8.46)\n\nThe solutions of this equation are given by\n2\n\n2\n\nh\u03b7 (M )i\u03be = h\u03b7 (M0 )i\u03be\n\n\u0012\n\nM0\nM\n\n\u00134\n\n\u01eb0\n+\n4B\n\n\"\u0012\n\nM0\nM\n\n\u00134\n\n#\n\n\u22121 .\n\n(8.47)\n\nProvided thatpthe fluctuations at the initial time corresponding to M = M0 are negligible (much\nsmaller than \u01eb0 /4B \u223c 1), the fluctuations become comparable to the background solution when\n2/3\nM \u223c M0 . Note that fluctuations of the horizon radius of order one in Planckian units do not\ncorrespond to Planck scale\n\u221a physics because near the horizon \u2206R = r \u2212 2M corresponds to a\nphysical distance L \u223c M \u2206R, as can be seen from the line element for Schwarzschild, ds2 =\n\u2212(1 \u2212 2M/r)dt2 + (1 \u2212 2M/r)\u22121 dr 2\u221a+ r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ), by considering pairs of points at constant\nt. So \u2206R \u223c 1 corresponds to L \u223c M , whereas a physical distance of order one is associated with\n\u2206R \u223c 1/M , which corresponds to an area change of order one for spheres with those radii. One\ncan, therefore, have initial fluctuations of the horizon radius of order one for physical distances\nwell above the Planck length for a black hole with a mass much larger than the Planck mass.\nOne expects that the fluctuations for states that are regular on the horizon correspond to physical\ndistances not much larger than the Planck length, so that the horizon radius fluctuations would\nbe much smaller than one for sufficiently large black hole masses. Nevertheless, that may not be\nthe case when dealing\n\u221a with states which are singular on the horizon, with estimated fluctuations of\n1/3\norder M\nor even M [381, 382, 383].\nThe result of HR for the growth of the fluctuations of the size of the black hole horizon agrees\nwith the result obtained by Bekenstein in Ref. [384] and implies that, for a sufficiently massive black\nhole (with a few solar masses or a supermassive black hole), the fluctuations become important\nbefore the Planckian regime is reached.\nThis growth of the fluctuations which was found by Bekenstein and confirmed here via the\nEinstein-Langevin equation seems to be in conflict with the estimate given by Wu and Ford in\nRef. [122]. According to their estimate, the accumulated mass fluctuations over a period of the\norder of the black hole evaporation time (\u2206t \u223c M03 ) would be of the order of the Planck mass.\nThe discrepancy is due to the fact that the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (8.45), which\n(1)\ncorresponds to the perturbed expectation value hT\u0302ab [g + h]iren in Eq. (8.42), was not taken into\naccount in Ref. [122]. The larger growth obtained here is a consequence of the secular effect of that\nterm, which builds up in time (slowly at first, during most of the evaporation time, and becoming\nmore significant at late times when the mass has changed substantially) and reflects the unstable\nnature of the background solution for an evaporating black hole.\n79\n\n\fAs for the relation between HR's results reported here and earlier results of Hu, Raval and\nSinha in Ref. [140], there should not be any discrepancy since both adopted the stochastic gravity\nframework and performed their analysis based on the Einstein-Langevin equation. The claim in\nRef. [140] was based on a qualitative argument that focused on the dynamics of the stochastic\nsource alone. If one adds in the consideration that the perturbations around the mean are unstable\nfor an evaporating black hole, their results agree.\nAll this can be qualitatively understood as follows. Consider an evaporating black hole with\ninitial mass M0 and suppose that the initial mass is perturbed by an amount \u03b4M0 = 1. The mean\nevolution for the perturbed black hole (without taking into account any fluctuations) leads to a\nmass perturbation that grows like \u03b4M = (M0 /M )2 \u03b4M0 = (M0 /M )2 , so that it becomes comparable\n2/3\nto the unperturbed mass M when M \u223c M0 , which coincides with the result obtained above. Such\na coincidence has a simple explanation: the fluctuations of the Hawking flux slowly accumulated\nduring most of the evaporating time, which are of the order of the Planck mass, as found by Wu\nand Ford, give a dispersion of that order for the mass distribution at the time when the instability\nof the small perturbations around the background solution start to become significant.\nWhen no such relation exists and consequences For conformal fields in two dimensional\nspacetimes, HR showed that the correlations between the energy flux crossing the horizon and the\nflux far from it vanish. The correlation function for the outgoing and ingoing null energy fluxes in\nan effectively two-dimensional model was explicitly computed in Refs. [391, 392] and it was also\nfound to vanish. On the other hand, in four dimensions the correlation function does not vanish\nin general and correlations between outgoing and ingoing fluxes do exist near the horizon (at least\npartially).\nFor black hole masses much larger than the Planck mass, one can use the adiabatic approximation for the background mean evolution. Therefore, to lowest order in LH one can compute\nthe fluctuations of the stress tensor in Schwarzschild spacetime. In Schwarzschild, the amplitude\nof the fluctuations of r 2 hTvr i far from the horizon is of order 1/M 2 (= M 2 /M 4 ) when smearing\nover a correlation time of order M , which one can estimate for a hot thermal plasma in flat space\n[100, 141] (see also Ref. [122] for a computation of the fluctuations of r 2 hTvr i far from the horizon).\nThe amplitude of the fluctuations of r 2 hTvr i is thus of the same order as its expectation value.\nHowever, their derivatives with respect to v are rather different: since the characteristic variation\ntimes for the expectation value and the fluctuations are M 3 and M respectively, \u2202(r 2 hTvr i)/\u2202v is\nof order 1/M 5 whereas \u2202(r 2 \u03bevr )/\u2202v is of order 1/M 3 . This implies an additional contribution of\norder LH due to the second term in Eq. (8.39) if one radially integrates the same equation applied\nto stress tensor fluctuations (the stochastic source in the Einstein-Langevin equation). Hence, in\ncontrast to the case of the mean value, the contribution from the second term in Eq. (8.39) cannot\nbe neglected when radially integrating since it is of the same order as the contributions from the\nfirst term, and one can no longer obtain a simple relation between the outgoing energy flux far\nfrom the horizon and the energy flux crossing the horizon.\nWhat then? Without this convenience (which almost all earlier researchers had taken for\ngranted) to get a more precise depiction we need to compute the noise kernel near the horizon.\nHowever, as shown by Hu and Phillips earlier [8] when they examine the coincidence limit of the\nnoise kernel, and confirmed by the careful analysis of Hu and Roura using smearing functions [354],\nthe noise kernel smeared over the horizon is divergent, and so are the induced metric fluctuations.\nHence, one cannot study the fluctuations of the horizon as a three-dimensional hypersurface for\n80\n\n\feach realization of the stochastic source because the amplitude of the fluctuations is infinite, even\nwhen restricting one's attention to the l = 0 sector. Instead one should regard the horizon as\npossessing a finite effective width due to quantum fluctuations. In order to characterize its width\none must find a sensible way of probing the metric fluctuations near the horizon and extracting\nphysically meaningful information, such as their effect on the Hawking radiation emitted by the\nblack hole. How to probe metric fluctuations is an issue at the root base which needs be dealt with\nin all discussions of metric fluctuations.\n8.3.3\n\nSummary and prospects\n\nThe work of Hu and Roura [354] based on the stochastic gravity program found that the sphericallysymmetric fluctuations of the horizon size of an evaporating black hole become important at late\n2/3\ntimes, and even comparable to its mean value when M \u223c M0 , where M0 is the mass of the\nblack hole at some initial time when the fluctuations of the horizon radius are much smaller than\nthe Planck length (remember that for large black hole masses this can still correspond to physical\ndistances much larger than the Planck length, as explained in Sec. 4). This is consistent with the\nresult previously obtained by Bekenstein in Ref. [384].\nIt is important to realize that for a sufficiently massive black hole, the fluctuations become\nsignificant well before the Planckian regime is reached. More specifically, for a solar mass black\nhole they become comparable to the mean value when the black hole radius is of the order of 10nm,\nwhereas for a supermassive black hole with M \u223c 107 M\u2299 , that happens when the radius reaches a\nsize of the order of 1mm. One expects that in those circumstances the low-energy effective field\ntheory approach of stochastic gravity should provide a reliable description.\nDue to the nonlinear nature of the back-reaction equations, such as Eq. (8.43), the fact that\nthe fluctuations of the horizon size can grow and become comparable to the mean value implies\nnon-negligible corrections to the dynamics of the mean value itself. This can be seen by expanding\nEq. (8.43) (evaluated on the horizon) in powers of \u03b7 and taking the expectation value. Through\norder \u03b7 2 we get\nd(M (v) + h\u03b7(v)i\u03be )\ndv\n\n= \u2212\n\n\u001c\n\nB\n(M (v) + \u03b7(v))2\n\"\n\n\u001d\n\n\u03be\n\n3\n2\nB\nh\u03b7(v)i\u03be + 2 h\u03b7 2 (v)i\u03be + O\n1\u2212\n= \u2212 2\nM (v)\nM (v)\nM (v)\n\n\u03b73\nM3\n\n!#\n\n. (8.48)\n\nWhen the fluctuations become comparable to the mass itself, the third term (and higher order\nterms) on the right-hand side is no longer negligible and we get non-trivial corrections to Eq. (8.41)\nfor the dynamics of the mean value. These corrections can be interpreted as higher order radiative\ncorrections to semiclassical gravity that include the effects of metric fluctuations on the evolution\nof the mean value.\nFinally we remark on the relation of this finding with earlier well-known results. Does the\nexistence of the significant deviations for the mean evolution mentioned above invalidate the earlier\nresults by Bardeen and Massar based on semiclassical gravity in Refs. [298, 341]? First, those deviations start to become significant only after a period of the order of the evaporation time when the\nmass of the black hole has decreased substantially. Second, since fluctuations were not considered\nin those references, a direct comparison cannot be established. Nevertheless,we can compare the\n81\n\n\faverage of the fluctuating ensemble. Doing so exhibits an evolution that deviates significantly when\nthe fluctuations become important. However, if one considers a single member of the ensemble at\nthat time, its evolution will be accurately described by the corresponding semiclassical gravity solution until the fluctuations around that particular solution become important again, after a period\nof the order of the evaporation time associated with the new initial value of the mass at that time.\n\n8.4\n\nOther work on metric fluctuations but without backreaction\n\nIn closing we mention some work on metric fluctuations where no backreaction is considered.\nBarrabes et al [125, 126] have considered the propagation of null rays and massless fields in a\nblack hole fluctuating geometry and have shown that the stochastic nature of the metric leads to a\nmodified dispersion relation and helps to confront the trans-Planckian frequency problem. However,\nin this case the stochastic noise is put in by hand and does not naturally arise from coarse graining\nas in a quantum open systems approach, in terms of which stochastic gravity can be interpreted.\nIt also does not take backreaction into account. It will be interesting to explore how a stochastic\nblack hole metric, arising as a solution to the Einstein-Langevin equation, hence fully incorporating\nbackreaction, would affect the trans-Planckian problem.\nAs mentioned earlier, Ford and his collaborators [121, 204, 122] have also explored the issue of\nmetric fluctuations in detail and in particular have studied the fluctuations of the black hole horizon\ninduced by metric fluctuations. However, the fluctuations they considered are in the context of a\nfixed background and do not relate to the backreaction.\nAnother work on metric fluctuations with no backreaction is that of Hu and Shiokawa [120], who\nstudy effects associated with electromagnetic wave propagation in a Robertson-Walker universe\nand the Schwarzschild spacetime with a small amount of given metric stochasticity. They find\nthat time-independent randomness can decrease the total luminosity of Hawking radiation due to\nmultiple scattering of waves outside the black hole and gives rise to event horizon fluctuations and\nfluctuations in the Hawking temperature. The stochasticity in a background metric in their work\nis assumed rather than derived (as induced by quantum field fluctuations). But it is interesting to\ncompare their results with that obtained in stochastic gravity with backreaction, so one can begin\nto get a sense of the different sources of stochasticity and their weights (see, e.g., [2] for a list of\npossible sources of stochasticity.)\nIn a subsequent paper Shiokawa [156] showed that the scalar and spinor waves in a stochastic\nspacetime behave similarly to the electrons in a disordered system. Viewing this as a quantum\ntransport problem, he expressed the conductance and its fluctuations in terms of a nonlinear sigma\nmodel in the closed time path formalism and showed that the conductance fluctuations are universal,\nindependent of the volume of the stochastic region and the amount of stochasticity. This result\ncan have significant importance in characterizing the mesoscopic behavior of spacetimes resting\nbetween the semiclassical and the quantum regimes.\n\n9\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn the first part of this review on the fundamentals of the theory we have given two routes to the\nestablishment of stochastic gravity and derived a general (finite) expression for the noise kernel. In\nthe second part we gave three applications, the correlation functions of gravitons in a perturbed\nMinkowski metric, structure formation in stochastic gravity theory and the outline of a program\n82\n\n\ffor the study of black hole fluctuations and backreaction. We have also discussed the problem of\nthe validity of semiclassical gravity, a central issue which stochastic gravity is in a unique position\nto address.\nWe have also pointed out a number of ongoing research related to the topics discussed in this\nreview. Such as the equivalence of the correlation functions for the metric perturbations obtained\nusing the Einstein-Langevin equations and the quantum correlation functions that follow from a\npurely quantum field theory calculation up to leading order in the large N limit. Or the calculation\nof the spectrum of the metric fluctuations in inflationary models driven by the trace anomaly due\nto conformally coupled fields. The related problem of the runaway solutions in the backreaction\nequations. The issue of the coincidence limit in the noise kernel for the black hole fluctuations.\nTheoretically, stochastic gravity is at the frontline of the 'bottom-up' approach to quantum\ngravity [157, 2, 170, 169]. pathway or angle starting from the well-defined and well-understood\ntheory of semiclassical gravity. Structurally, as can be seen from the issues discussed and the applications given, stochastic gravity has a very rich constituency because it is based on quantum field\ntheory and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in a curved spacetime context. The open systems\nconcepts and the closed-time-path / influence functional methods constitute an extended framework\nsuitable for treating the backreaction and fluctuations problems of dynamical spacetimes interacting with quantum fields. We have seen applications to cosmological structure formation and black\nhole backreaction from particle creation. A more complete understanding of the backreaction of\nHawking radiation in a fully dynamical black hole situation will enable one to address fundamental\nissues such as the black hole end state and information loss puzzles. The main reason why this\nprogram has not progressed as swiftly as desired is due more to technical rather than programatic\ndifficulties (such as finding reasonable analytic approximations for the Green function or numerical evaluation of mode-sums near the black hole horizon). Finally, the multiplex structure of this\ntheory could be used to explore new lines of inquiry and launch new programs of research, such as\nnonequilibrium black hole thermodynamics and the microscopic structures of spacetime.\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe materials presented here originated from research work of BLH with Antonio Campos, Nicholas\nPhillips, Alpan Raval, Albert Roura and Sukanya Sinha, and of EV with Rosario Martin and Albert\nRoura.
