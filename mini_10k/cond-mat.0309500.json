In this paper we address the specific question of how the electron-electron interactions\nchange the magnetic susceptibility of quantum dots using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation.\nOur motivation stems mainly from the intriguing experimental data collected in the early 90's by L\u00e9vy and\ncollaborators,5 who measured the orbital magnetic susceptibility of an array of mesoscopic squares lithografically inscribed in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The\nauthors found a surprisingly large paramagnetic susceptibility and a power law dependence of the zero-field\nsusceptibility \u03c70 (B) \u2261 \u03c7(B = 0, T ) with temperature.\nThe first result is understood by means of a semiclassical single-particle analysis, showing that the magnetic\nsusceptibility in ballistic devices is determined by the enclosed area and the stability of the shortest classical periodic orbits of the cavity.6,7,8,9,10,11 More specifically, the\ncavity geometry determines the classical periodic orbits\nrelevant for \u03c7(B, T ), provided B is weak. For generic\nintegrable systems such orbits come in families and the\nmagnitude \u03c7(B, T ) scales as kF L, where kF is the wave\nnumber at the Fermi energy and L is the typical length\nscale of the cavity. In contrast, periodic orbits of chaotic\nsystems are isolated and \u03c7(B, T ) \u221d (kF L)1/2 . The semiclassical theoretical analysis also predicts an exponential\ndecay for \u03c70 (T ), which conflicts with the experimental\ndata that display a much weaker temperature dependence. The experimental results5 raised natural and important questions, concerning the role of disorder and\n\ninteractions. These issues triggered interesting advances\nin the semiclassical approach. The disorder in the devices we are interested in is weak and long ranged, and\nhence dominated by small angle scattering. It was convincingly shown12 that such kind of disorder has little influence on the semiclassical results derived for perfectly\nclean systems. A more far reaching and fundamental\nquestion is the role electron-electron interactions. In a\nsophisticated semiclassical approximation to the manybody problem, Ullmo and collaborators13 showed that\ninteractions make \u03c7(B, T ) scale as kF L for integrable\nsystems and kF L/ ln(kF L) for chaotic ones. There two\nkey approximations that allow for a full analytical treatment presented in Ref. 13. One approximation is to\nconsider a zero-range residual interaction, that beclouds\nthe exchange interaction, and the other is to give up self\nconsistency.\nFurther motivation stems from a more recent experiment on the orbital magnetization of quantum-dot\narrays14 that found a magnetization value two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the one predicted by the noninteracting single-particle picture. Existing theoretical predictions based on the direct numerical diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian for a few electrons15,16,17,18 and on a mean\nfield approximation of the many-body problem19 indicated that the electron-electron interaction plays dominant role in the magnetic properties of quantum dots as\nclearly observed in the experiment.14\nIn this work, we resume the discussion on the influence of electron-electron interactions by studying the orbital magnetic response of a N -electron interacting system in a self-consistent Hartree-Fock (SCHF) approximation. The screened Coulomb electron-electron interaction is modelled by the short-range Yukawa potential\nV (r) = V0 e\u2212\u03bar /r. Exact results are only known for the\nN = 2 case.17,18 The mean field approximation allows us\nto study systems up to N \u223c 40 interacting electrons. Although the typical experimental dots in Refs. [5,14] have\na much larger number of electrons, our study provides a\n\n\f2\nqualitative understanding of the interaction effects in the\nmagnetic properties of the system.\nWe calculate the ground state energy Eg , magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility as a function of the relevant parameters of the system, namely, the temperature\nT , the potential range \u03ba and the magnetic field B. Our\nresults show discontinuities in Eg (B) at T = 0, as previously reported.20 These features are smoothed out for\nfinite temperature.\nWe show that the magnetic response of a twodimensional electronic cavity depends strongly on the\nelectron-electron interaction and the magnetic susceptibility shows an oscillatory behavior similar to de Haasvon Alphen oscillations in metals. Furthermore, the amplitude and period of such oscillations are modified by\nthe electron-electron interaction. We discriminate the\nkinetic, direct, and exchange contributions to the total\nmagnetic susceptibility. The direct and exchange contributions also oscillate but with a different phase compared to the kinetic contribution. We also find that the\nsusceptibility dependence on temperature and interaction strength displays non-universal features which are\nstrongly dependent on the parameters. A slight enhancement of the zero-field susceptibility is seen as the number of electrons increases. The interaction-induced magnetic susceptibility shows paramagnetic and diamagnetic\nphases both as a function of temperature and interaction\nstrength. A rather unexpected result is the behavior of\nthe exchange interaction contribution to \u03c7(B), which becomes larger than the direct contribution as the interaction strength increases.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present\nthe model system considered in this study and the mean\nfield solution in the SCHF approximation. The main results are shown in Sec. III. Section IV brings the final\nremarks and conclusions. We also include an appendix\nwhere we present some specific details of the SCHF numerical implementation in the presence of discrete symmetries.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider the problem of N two-dimensional (2D)\ninteracting electrons in a confining potential subjected to\nan external magnetic field B perpendicular to the electron system. Since we study the orbital contribution to\nthe magnetization, we are allowed to simplify the problem and treat the electrons as spinless. The model Hamiltonian reads as\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nh(rn ) +\n\nN\nX\n\nv(rn , rn\u2032 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nn<n\u2032\n\nwhere rn indicates the position of the nth electron. The\nsingle-particle Hamiltonian h is given by\ni2\ne\n1 h\np\n+\nA(r)\n+ u(r) ,\n(2)\nh(r) =\n2m\u2217\nc\n\nwhere m\u2217 is the electron effective mass. The vector\npotential A is chosen in the symmetric gauge, namely,\nA = (\u2212By/2, Bx/2, 0). The magnetic field is expressed\nin units of \u03a6/\u03a60 , where \u03a6 = BA is the magnetic flux\nthrough the system area A and \u03a60 = hc/e is the unit\nquantum flux. We choose the confining potential u(r)\nas the 2D square well of side L that closely models the\nexperiment.5\nTo account for screening effects the electron-electron\ninteraction v is modelled by18\n\u2032\n\nv(r, r\u2032 ) =\n\ne2 e\u2212\u03ba|r\u2212r |\n,\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebr |r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba gives the effective interaction range and \u01ebr is the\nbackground dielectric constant. For \u03ba = 0 there is no\nscreening and the bare Coulomb interaction is recovered.\nEven though the v(r, r\u2032 ) in Eq. (3) is different from the\nscreened electron-electron interaction in the 2DEG when\neffects of the finite layer-thickness and image charges are\ntaken into account,21 the Yukawa potential captures the\nmain features of a more realistic interaction and has the\nadvantage of being computationally more amenable to\nhandle.22 We recall that the semiclassical approach is\nforced to use zero-range residual interaction in order to\nmake the calculations feasible. By doing so, one looses a\nhandle on the exchange interaction.\nFor a square dot of side L, the potential energy\nscales with 1/L while the kinetic energy scales with\n1/L2 . Hence, as L is increased, the potential energy\nbecomes increasingly more important. It is then useful\nto introduce20 an \"effective strength\" parameter L/a\u2217B ,\nwhere a\u2217B = h\u03042 (4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebr )/m\u2217 e2 is the effective Bohr radius. The standard dimensionless parameter that quantifies the ratio between electronic potential and kinetic en\u2217 2\nergies is rs , that in 2D reads rs2 = A/(N \u03c0[a\n\u221a B ] ). Hence,\n\u2217\n\u2217\nL/aB and rs are related as rs = (L/aB )/ \u03c0N . We consider here a range of parameters such that 1.5 < rs < 2,\nwithin the typical values of rs in the experiments.5,14\nWe calculate the ground-state energy in the SCHF approximation for finite temperatures. The SCHF equations read as23,24\n\u0015\nX\u0014 Z\n\u2032 \u2217 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nnj dr \u03c6j (r )v(r, r )\u03c6j (r ) \u03c6i (r)\nh(r)\u03c6i (r) +\nj\n\n\u2212\n\nX\u0014\nj\n\nnj\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\ndr\u2032 \u03c6\u2217j (r\u2032 )v(r, r\u2032 )\u03c6j (r)\u03c6i (r\u2032 )\n\n= \u03b5HF\ni \u03c6i (r), (4)\n\nwhere the sums run over all HF orbitals. Here ni =\n\u22121\n{exp[(\u03b5HF\nis the Fermi occupation numi \u2212\u03bc)/kB T ]+1}\nber of the ith HF orbital with corresponding wave function \u03c6i (r) and energy \u03b5HF\ni . As standard, the chemical\nP\npotential \u03bc is determined by requiring that N = i ni .\nWe truncate the number of orbitals and take only the\nM \u2248 2N lowest energy states into account.\nThe SCHF ground state energy is given by\nEgHF \u2261 T HF + VdHF \u2212 VxHF\n\n\f3\n\u0010\n1X\nni nj h\u03c6i \u03c6j |v|\u03c6i \u03c6j i\n2 i,j\n\n\u0011\n\u2212h\u03c6i \u03c6j |v|\u03c6j \u03c6i i ,\n\n\u0011\n1 X \u0010 HF\nni \u03b5i + h\u03c6i |h|\u03c6i i .\n2 i\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n(6)\n100\n\n100\n0\n\nThe calculations of the matrix elements were done numerically, with no further approximations other than setting the numerical precision. The number of elements\ngrows as M 4 , where M is the basis size. For a typical\ncalculation where we take M \u223c 50, a numerical evaluation of about 107 four-dimensional integrals is required,\na task far from trivial. To reduce that number, we have\nused an appropriate symmetrized basis on which the HF\npotential takes a block-diagonal form. Furthermore, we\nuse properties of the the Yukawa-like e-e interaction to\nreduce the four-dimensional integrals to a series of onedimensional integrals on the relative polar angle. These\nsteps are described in Ref. 18.

In this section we present a general discussion of the model Hamiltonian single-particle\nspectrum that serves as a guide to interpret the magnetic\nresults that follow.\nFigure 1 shows the single-particle HF spectrum as a\nfunction of the magnetic flux \u03a6/\u03a60 for N = 10 electrons\nwith rs = 1.22 for T = 0 (left) and T = \u2206 (right).\nHere and throughout the manuscript \u2206 is the singleparticle mean level spacing. Energy is given in units of\nh\u03042 /(m\u2217 L2 ).\nA very interesting feature displayed in Fig. 1 are the\njumps in \u03b5HF\ni (B) for the T = 0 case. These discontinuities appear for other values of N as well and are related\nto sudden anti-crossings at Fermi energy, i.e., involving\nHF\nthe levels \u03b5HF\nN and \u03b5N +1 . For T = 0 the mean field selects\nthe N lowest states. Hence, by parametrically moving\nthrough a level crossing, the character of the last occupied state is suddenly changed, and so is the mean-field.\nNarrow crossings, with a gap \u03b4\u03b5 \u226a \u2206, that lead to sudden\nand very strong changes in the last occupied mean-field\nstate, are responsible for the jumps.\nThe jumps disappear already for very low temperatures of the order of kB T \u2248 \u03b4\u03b5 \u226a \u2206, as illustrated in\n\n5\n\n10\n\n/\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n/\n\n0\n\n15\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: Single-particle Hartree-Fock energy levels \u03b5HF\nas a\ni\nfunction of the magnetic flux \u03a6/\u03a60 for (a) T = 0 and (b)\nkB T = \u2206. Here N = 10 and rs = 1.22.\n\nFig. 1(b). For this reason, they are of very limited relevance for the experiments we are interested in, where\nkB T \u226b \u2206. However, Fermi energy anti-crossings explain similar features reported in the study of groundstate properties of quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime, that remained so far not understood.20 Albeit also blurred by temperature, the later case deals\nwith transport where the ground state many-body wave\nfunction matters and thus the Anderson orthogonality\ncatastrophe can come into play.26,27\n\nIV.\n\nGROUND-STATE PROPERTIES\n\nThe magnetization m(B) and the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(B) of an electronic cavity are obtained from\n\nm(B) = \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202B\n\nand\n\n\u03c7(B) = \u2212\n\n1 \u22022\u03a9\n.\nL2 \u2202B 2\n\n(7)\n\nIn turn, the grand canonical potential \u03a9 is directly computed from the ground state HF energy by \u03a9 = EgHF \u2212\nT S \u2212 N \u03bc, where S is the entropy and \u03bc the chemical\npotential, both functions of B.\nIn the remaining of the paper, the magnetization is\ngiven in units of the effective Bohr magneton \u03bc\u2217B =\neh\u0304/2m\u2217 c and the magnetic susceptibility is expressed\nin units of the Landau susceptibility, namely |\u03c7L | =\ne2 /(12\u03c0m\u2217 c2 ). For simplicity, the non-interacting case\nis referred to as \"L/a\u2217B = 0\".\n\n\f0\n\n/|\n\nL\n\n|\n\n4\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0.0\n-2.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nL\n\n|\n\n1\n\n0.0\n\n/|\n\n-2.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n/|\n\nL\n\n|\n\n-5.0\n\n-5.0\n2.5\n\n0\n\n/|\n\nL\n\n|\n\n-1\n\n0.0\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-5.0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n-3\n\nN\n\n0\n\n5\n\nL/a*\n\nFIG. 2: Top panel: zero-field susceptibility \u03c70 as a function\nof the particle number N for the non-interacting (thick solid\nline with filled circles) and rs = 1.5 (open circles) cases at\nkB T = \u2206/2. Middle panel: the same for the kinetic term\n(open squares). Bottom panel: the same for the exchange\ncontribution (open triangles) to the magnetic susceptibility.\n\nA.\n\nExchange contribution\n\nFollowing Eq. (5), one can distinguish different contributions to the magnetic susceptibility, namely\n\u03c7 = \u03c7kin + \u03c7d + \u03c7x\n\n(8)\n\narising from the kinetic, direct, and exchange interaction\nterms of the HF ground state energy EgHF (B). As shown\nbellow, it is instructive to compare the later with the\nsusceptibility computed for non-interacting electrons in\na square cavity, \u03c7non\u2212int .\nThe zero-field susceptibility \u03c70 (T ) \u2261 \u03c7(B = 0, T ) is\nobtained for different N up to N = 20 at kB T = \u2206/2.\nThe results are shown on Fig. 2. The noninteracting\nsusceptibility \u03c7non\u2212int (filled circles) oscillates with increasing amplitude as N is varied (or equivalently, as a\nfunction of kF L). This is in agreement with the previous semiclassical calculations.6,7,8,9 As we include the\nelectron-electron interaction included, keeping rs \u2248 1.5\nfor all N , the interacting susceptibility (open circles) sensibly deviates from the noninteracting case. We find that\nsuch deviations are mainly caused by the exchange contribution to the susceptibility. While the kinetic contribution (squares) resembles the noninteracting situation,\nthe exchange term (triangles) exhibits rather large fluctuations, which are the main responsible for the deviations\nin the total interacting susceptibility.\nThe exchange contribution to the susceptibility increases with the interaction strength L/a\u2217B and is already\nof the order of the kinetic contribution for rs \u2248 1.5. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 3, where we chose a maximum of the\nnoninteracting \u03c70non\u2212int (N ), namely, N = 20 and vary\nL/a\u2217B . For low values of L/a\u2217B , the paramagnetic kinetic\nterm \u03c7kin (filled squares) dominates and stays almost\n\n10\n\nB\n\nFIG. 3: Zero-field susceptibility \u03c70 (circles) as a function of\ninteracting strength L/a\u2217B for N = 20 electrons and kB T =\n\u2206/2. Kinetic (squares), direct interaction (filled triangles),\nand exchange interaction (empty triangles) contributions to\n\u03c70 are shown for comparison.\n\nconstant while the total susceptibility decreases. This\nbehavior of the total susceptibility is dictated by the exchange term \u03c7x , which is initially of the order of the direct contribution. As the interaction strength increases,\nboth the absolute value of the direct and exchange terms\nincrease. It is interesting to notice that \u03c7x overcomes \u03c7d\nfor L/a\u2217B \u2248 5 (rs \u2248 0.63) and is of the same order as the\nkinetic term for L/a\u2217B \u2248 10 (rs \u2248 1.26).\nThis is a somewhat unexpected result, since the direct\ncontribution VdHF to the ground state energy is 3 to 4\ntimes larger than the exchange contribution VxHF in this\nrange of rs . It turns out, however, that the magnetic VxHF\nis more sensitive to variations of the magnetic filed than\nVdHF , giving rise to the larger exchange contribution.\nB.\n\nMagnetic field effects\n\nThe electron-electron interaction also induces some\nnontrivial effects in the magnetic field dependence of both\nthe magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility. The\nresults for m(B) and \u03c7(B) in the Coulomb (\u03ba = 0) case\nare shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for different N and L/a\u2217B . In\nthis subsection we take kB T of the order of \u2206, to wash\nout effects due to level crossings, while preserving the\nquantum effects due to long energy range spectral correlations.\nIn the noninteracting case, the magnetization curves\nfor different N values are very similar. For low fields,\nsmall oscillations arise and, as \u03a6 increases, a positive\nmagnetization phase appears. When the interaction between the electrons is included, the magnetization curves\nfor N = 10 and N = 20 are quite different (see Fig. 4).\nIn particular, for L/a\u2217B = 10, the orbital magnetization\n\n\f5\n\n5\n\n*)\n\n4\n\n16\n\n5\n\n12\n\n4\n\nB\n\n8\n\n3\n\n3\n\n|\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\nL\n\n0\n\n2\n\n/|\n\nm(B) (\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n/\n\n-2\n\n15\n\n-3\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n/\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4: Magnetization m(B) as a function of B = \u03a6/L for\nL/a\u2217B = 0 (circles), 2 (diamonds), 5 (filled triangles), and 8\n(open triangles).

The temperature is kB T = \u2206.\n\nis about four times larger for N = 20 then for N = 10.\nThis suggests that large systems can display strong orbital magnetization effects, in line with the experimental\nresults.14\nFor N = 5, a clear oscillatory behavior is seen on \u03c7(B)\n(see top of Fig. 5). The amplitudes are of order |\u03c7L | and,\nas the interaction strength is increased, both the amplitude and frequency also increase. This behavior is similar\nto the de Hass-von Alphen effect observed in metals. In\nthat case, both the amplitude and frequency of \u03c7(B) oscillations are proportional to the chemical potential of\n\nthe system. In the single-particle effective potential approximation, an increase in the interaction strength is\nequivalent to an increase in the effective chemical potential of the HF levels, which corroborates the analogy.\nThe oscillations are modified with increasing number of\nparticles, see bottom panel of Fig. 5. For larger values of\nL/a\u2217B , \u03c7(B) displays fluctuations near \u03a6/\u03a60 = 10 due to\ncrossings between the Hartree-Fock single-particle states\nat the Fermi level, as discussed in Sec. III. Notice that\nalthough the level crossing jumps in the single-particle\nspectrum seem to have already disappeared at kB T = \u2206,\nsee Fig. 1, they are greatly enhanced in \u03c7(B), due the\nsecond derivative in Eq. (7).\nWe observe that the exchange part plays an important\nrole to for the computation of the B dependence on the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7. In Fig. 6 all contributions are\nshown as a function of \u03a6/\u03a60 for a lower temperature,\nnamely kB T = \u2206/2 and rs = 0.9. The pronounced paramagnetic peak around \u03a6/\u03a60 \u2248 10 (also observed at the\nbottom panel of Fig. 5) is mainly due to the exchange\ncontribution \u03c7x . Notice that frequently \u03c7d and \u03c7x give\ncontributions of opposite signs appears as \u03a6/\u03a60 is varied.\nIt is worth mentioning that these results are somewhat\ndifferent from the ones obtained by the exact diagonalization for the two-electron case,18 where the electron spin\nplays an important role on the orbital properties of the\nsystem. In that situation, singlet-triplet transitions give\nrise to low-temperature peaks of about 3|\u03c7L | of magnitude in the orbital susceptibility but no oscillatory behavior is found on \u03c7(B). Also, the magnetization m(B)\nin the exact N = 2 case is always negative, even in the\nlarge field regime.\n\n\f6\n\n1\n\nL\n\n|\n\n2.0\n\nL\n\n|\n\n/|\n\n0\n\n0.0\n1\n\n0\n\n/|\n\n-1\n\n0\nL\n\n|\n\n4\n\n/|\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n/|\n\nL\n\n|\n\n-2.0\n\n0\n\n-4.0\n\n-3\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n/\n\nIn Fig. 7, we compare the susceptibilities in the case\nof Coulomb and short-range potentials. In order to get a\nqualitative comparison, we consider the strong-screening\nregime, using \u03ba\u22121 = L/10.\nIn this short-range limit, the interaction between the\nelectrons is exponentially suppressed for distances larger\nthan the screening length \u03ba\u22121 and the overall magnetic\nresponse, which is averaged over the whole dot, is then\nsimilar to the noninteracting case. This can be clearly\nseen in Fig. 7where the curves for \u03ba\u22121 = L/10 are quite\nsimilar to those for L/a\u2217B = 0 depicted in Fig. 5, showing that the shielding of the electron-electron interaction\nis quite effective and a noninteracting picture is a good\napproximation for the thermodynamic properties of the\nsystem.\nFor such\u221alow screening lengths, the Fermi wavelength\n\u03bbF \u223c \u03c0L/ N is larger than \u03ba\u22121 by one order of magnitude. In the regime \u03bbF \u226b \u03ba\u22121 , the 2D screened interaction can be well approximated by a \u03b4-type contact\ninteraction.13 Our results show that the noninteracting\npicture captures the main features of such approximation in the Hartree-Fock scheme. Therefore, one has to\nconsider larger screening lengths in order to see residual interaction effects in the magnetization and magnetic\nsusceptibility.\n\nTemperature dependence\n\nThe zero-field susceptibility decays with temperature,\nas expected, but the decay rate is rather large. For\nkB T /\u2206 = 3, \u03c70 is already negligible compared to the\nT = 0 value (see Fig. 8). In the intermediate range\nof kB T \u223c \u2206, non-universal features arise. As an example, the inset of Fig. 8 shows our result for a dot with\nN = 5 electrons: \u03c70 (T ) is negative (except for T \u223c 0)\n\n0.8\n\n1.6\n\nk T/\nB\n\n2\n\n2.4\n\nk T/\n\n0\n\nFIG. 7: Magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(B) for different interaction\nranges (Coulomb [circles] and \u03ba\u22121 = L/10 [triangles]) for N =\n5 (top) and N = 10 (bottom).\n\nC.\n\n0.0\n\n15\n\n1\n\nB\n\nFIG. 8: Temperature dependence of the zero-field susceptibility \u03c70 (T ) for N = 10 and L/a\u2217B = 0 (diamonds), 2 (squares)\nand 5 (triangles).

In both cases, the interactioninduced susceptibility, \u03c7\u2212\u03c7non\u2212int, is positive, indicating\na paramagnetic contribution due to the electron-electron\ninteraction.\nSuch a diamagnetic-paramagnetic transition for increasing N is in agreement with previous theoretical results. For N = 2, exact diagonalization results18 show\nthat \u03c70 (T ) is diamagnetic for a temperature range up to\n10\u2206. On the other hand, semiclassical analysis6,7,9 suggests a paramagnetic \u03c70 (T ) for N \u223c 100 . Therefore, a\ndiamagnetic-paramagnetic transition is expected in the\nintermediate particle number regime.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have considered the ground-state properties of a\nsystem of N interacting electrons confined in a 2D geometry and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field in\nthe finite temperature SCHF approximation. The magnetic susceptibility was calculated as a function of the\nrelevant parameters of the system (magnetic field, number of electrons, temperature, and strength and range of\nthe particle interaction). The ground-state energy was\nobtained for both the Coulomb interaction and the shortrange Yukawa potential.\nOur results show that the electron-electron interaction\nintroduces nontrivial effects in the magnetic properties of\nthe system. The magnetic susceptibility shows de Hassvan Alphen-like oscillations which are enhanced as the\ninteraction strength increases. The magnetization in-\n\n\f7\ncreases when more electrons are added in the dot, which\nindicates that a strong orbital magnetization should be\nexpected for larger systems. For a higher number of electrons, new features arise, including strong diamagnetic\nfluctuations as a function of the magnetic field.\nThe zero-field susceptibility \u03c70 (T ) shows both paramagnetic and diamagnetic phases as a function of the\ntemperature. We found that \u03c70 (T ) \u2192 0 as T increases\nand the susceptibility induced by interaction is positive,\nyielding a paramagnetic contribution to \u03c70 irrespective\nof the value of N . However, non-universal N -dependent\nfeatures appear in the intermediate temperature range of\nkB T \u2248 \u2206.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Brazilian funding agencies FAPESP, CNPq, PRONEX, and by the Instituto do\nMil\u00eanio de Nanoci\u00eancias.
