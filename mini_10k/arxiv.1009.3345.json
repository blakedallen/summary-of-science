INTRODUCTION\nIn multi-antenna wireless networks, precoding can effectively mitigate interference between coexisting links. This\npaper presents a new approach of efficiently implementing precoding in the two-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\ninterference channels by exchanging finite-rate channel state\ninformation (CSI). Specifically, precoders are designed to\nsuppress interference to the interfered receivers based on\ntheir quantized CSI feedback, and the residual interference\nis regulated by additional feedback of power control signals.\nRecently, progresses have been made in analyzing the\ncapacity of multi-antenna interference channels. In particular,\ninterference alignment techniques have been proposed for\nachieving the channel capacity for high signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs) [1]. Such techniques, however, have limited practicality due to their complexity, requirement of perfect global\nCSI and their sub-optimality for finite SNRs. This prompts\nthe development of linear precoding algorithms for practical\ndecentralized wireless networks [2]\u2013[5]. For time-division\nmultiplexing (TDD) multiple-input-single-output (MISO) interference channels, it is proposed in [2], [5] that forwardlink beamformers can be adapted distributively based on\nreverse-link signal-to-interference-pluse-noise ratios (SINRs).\nTargeting the two-user MIMO interference channels, linear\ntransceivers are designed in [3] under the constraint of one\ndata stream per user and using different criteria including\nzero-forcing and minimum mean square error. In [4], the\nrate region for MISO interference channels is analyzed based\non the cognitive radio principle, yielding a message passing\n\nalgorithm for enabling distributive beamforming. The above\nprior work does not address the issue of finite-rate feedback\nthough it is widely used in the practice to enable precoding.\nNeglecting feedback CSI errors in precoder designs leads to\nover optimistic network performance.\nFor MIMO precoding systems, the substantiality of CSI\nfeedback overhead has motivated extensive research on CSI\nquantization algorithms, forming a field called limited feedback [6]. Recent limited feedback research has focused on\nMIMO downlink systems, where multiuser CSI feedback\nsupports space division multiple access (SDMA) [7]. It has\nbeen found that the number of feedback bits per user has to\nincrease with the transmit SNR so as to bound the throughput\nloss caused by feedback quantization [8]. Furthermore, such\na loss can be reduced by exploiting multiuser diversity [9],\n[10]. Designing limited feedback algorithms for interference\nchannels is more challenging due to the decentralized network\narchitecture and the growth of feedback CSI. Cooperative feedback algorithms are proposed in [11] for a two-user cognitive\nradio network, where the secondary transmitter adjusts its\nbeamformer to suppress interference to the primary receiver\nthat cooperates by feedback to the secondary transmitter. This\ndesign is tailored for a MISO cognitive radio network and thus\nunsuitable for general MIMO interference channels, which\nmotivates the current work.\nWe consider two coexisting MIMO links where all nodes\nemploy equal numbers of antennas and linear precoding is\nenabled by quantized cooperative feedback. Channels are\nassumed to have i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. A systematic method is\nproposed for jointly designing linear precoders and equalizers\nunder an orthogonality constraint, which decouples the links\nin the case of perfect feedback. To be specific, precoders and\nequalizers are decomposed into inner and outer components,\nwhere the former are designed to suppress residual interference\ncaused by feedback errors and the latter to enhance link array\ngain. Second, additional scalar cooperative feedback, called\ninterference power control (IPC) feedback, is proposed for\ncontrolling transmitters' power so as to regulate the residual\ninterference. Specifically, the IPC feedback algorithms are\ndesigned using different criteria including fixed interference\nmargin, maximum sum throughput, and minimum outage\nprobability.\nNotation: The superscript \u2020 represents matrix Hermitian\ntranspose. The operator [X]k gives the kth column of a matrix\nX. Let \u0016, \u227a, \u0017 and \u001f represent element-wise inequalities\nbetween two real vectors.\n\n\fboth links, called sum throughput, is defined as\n\nlocal feedback\n\nT1\n\nd\nee\nef\n\no\nco\n\npe\n\nba\n\nck\n\nR1\n\nC\u0304 :=\n\n2 X\nM\n\u0011i\n\u0010\nh\nX\n[`]\nE log2 1 + SINRm\n\n(2)\n\nm=1 `=1\n\niv\nrat\n\nT2\n\nR2\n\n[`]\nwhere SINRm\nis given in (1). Next, consider the scenario\nwhere the coding rates for all data streams are fixed at\nlog2 (1 + \u03b8) where \u03b8 is the receive SINR threshold for correct\ndecoding. We define an outage event as one that the SINR of\nat least one data stream is smaller than \u03b8. It follows that the\noutage probability is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n[`]\nPout := Pr min min SINRm \u2264 \u03b8 .\n(3)\nm=1,2 1\u2264`\u2264M\n\nFig. 1.\n\nMIMO interference channels with local and cooperative feedback.\n\nA. Precoder Design\n\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nWe consider two interfering wireless links as illustrated\nin Fig. 1, where the two pairs of transceivers are denoted\nas (T1 , R1 ) and (T2 , R2 ). Each transmitter/receiver has L\nantennas employed for suppressing the interference as well\nas supporting spatial multiplexing. These functions require\nCSI feedback from receivers to their interferers and intended\ntransmitters, called cooperative feedback and local feedback,\nrespectively. We assume perfect CSI estimation and local\nfeedback, allowing the current design to focus on suppressing\ninterference caused by cooperative feedback quantization. All\nchannels are assumed to follow independent blocking fading.\nThe channel coefficients are samples of i.i.d. CN (0, 1) random\nvariables. Let Hmn denote a L \u00d7 L i.i.d. CN (0, 1) matrix\nrepresenting fading of the channel from Tn to Rm . Then the\ninterference channels are modeled as {\u03bdHmn } and the data\nchannels as {Hmm } where m, n \u2208 {1, 2} and m 6= n. The\nfactor \u03bd < 1 quantifies the difference in transmission distance\nbetween the data and interference links.\nEach link supports M \u2264 L spatial data streams by linear\nprecoding and equalization. To regulate residual interference\ncaused by precoder feedback errors, the total transmission\npower of each transmitter is constrained by cooperative IPC\nfeedback. For simplicity, the scalar IPC feedback is assumed\nperfect since it requires much less overhead than the precoder\nfeedback. Each transmitter uses identical transmission power\nfor all spatial streams, represented by Pn for Tn with n = 1, 2\nand the maximum Pmax . Assume that all additive white noise\nsamples are i.i.d. CN (0, 1) random variables. Let Gm and\nFm denote the linear equalizer used by Rm and the linear\nprecoder applied at Tm , respectively. Thus the receive signalto-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at Rm for the `th\nstream can be written as\n[`]\nSINRm\n:=\n\nPm |[Gm ]\u2020` Hmm [Fm ]` |2\n1 + Pn \u03bdk[Gm ]\u2020` Hmn Fn k2\n\nIII. P RECODING WITH L IMITED F EEDBACK\n\n,\n\nm 6= n.\n\n(1)\n\nTwo performance metrics, ergodic throughput and outage\nprobability, are considered. The total ergodic throughput of\n\nA pair of precoder and equalizer (Gm , Fn ) with m 6= n are\njointly designed under the following orthogonality constraint\nG\u2020m Hmn Fn = 0,\n\nm, n \u2208 {1, 2}, m 6= n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe constraint aims at decoupling the links and requires that\nL \u2265 2M . A key step of the proposed design is to decompose\nthe precoder Fn into an inner precoder Fin and an outer\nprecoder Fon . Specifically, Fn = Fin Fon where Fin and Fon are\nL \u00d7 M and M \u00d7 M matrices, respectively, where the size of\nFin is minimized to reduce feedback overhead. Similarly, we\ndecompose the equalizer Gm as Gm = Gim Gom where Gim\nis a L \u00d7 N inner equalizer and Gom a N \u00d7 M outer equalizer,\nwhere N is a design parameter under the constraints N \u2265 M\nand N \u2264 L \u2212 M . The inner precoder/equalizer pair (Gim , Fin )\nis designed to enforce the constraint in (4) while the outer\npair (Gom , Fon ) enhances the link array gain as discussed in\nthe sequel. It follows that\n(Gim )\u2020 Hmn Fin = 0,\n\nm 6= n.\n\n(5)\n\nUnder this constraint, (Gim , Fin ) are designed by decomposing\nHmn using the singular value decomposition (SVD) as\n\uf8eeq\n\uf8f9\n[1]\n\u03bb\n0\nmn\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \u2020\n..\nHmn = Vmn \uf8ef\n\uf8fa Umn , m 6= n (6)\n.\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\nq\n[L]\n0\n\u03bbmn\nwhere the unitary matrices Vmn and Umn consist of the left\nand right\nsingular\nvectors of Hmn as columns, respectively,\nn\no\n[`]\nand \u03bbmn denote the eigenvalues of Hmn H\u2020mn following\nthe descending order. Let A and B be two subsets of the\nindices {1, 2, * * * , L} with |A| = N , |B| = M , and A\u2229B = \u2205.\nThe constraint in (5) can be satisfied by choosing\nGim = {[Vmn ]k | k \u2208 A} and Fin = {[Umn ]k | k \u2208 B}. (7)\nGiven (Gim , Fim ), the outer pair (Gom , Fom ) are jointly\ndesigned based on the SVD of the N \u00d7 M effective channels\n\n\fHomm := Gim Hmm Fim :\n\uf8eeq\n[1]\n\uf8ef \u03bbmm\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nHomm = Vmm \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0\n0\n\n[`]\n\nLemma 1.

CN (0, 1) random\nvariables and their distributions are independent of (Gim , Fim )\nsince Hmm is isotropic. To transmit data through the eigenmodes of Hmm , Gom and Fom are chosen as\nGom = {[Vmm ]1 , [Vmm ]2 , * * * , [Vmm ]M } and Fom = Umm .\nWith perfect CSI feedback, the above precoder and equalizer\njoint design converts each data link into M parallel spatial\nchannels which are free of interference.\nNote that increasing N enhances the array gain of both\nlinks. Specifically, the expectations of the SNRs increase with\nN . Thus, N should take its maximum (L \u2212 M ). However,\nmaximizing N need not be optimal for the link performance\nin the case of quantized feedback as discussed in the sequel.\nB. Quantized Precoder Feedback\nIn this section, we choose the index sets A and B in (7) with\nthe objective of suppressing the residual interference caused\nby precoder feedback errors.\nRecall that the precoding at Tn is enabled by quantized\ncooperative feedback of Fin from Rm with m 6= n. Let F\u0302in\ndenote the quantized version of Fin and define the resultant\nquantization error \u000fn as\nk(Fin )\u2020 F\u0302in k2F\n\u000fn := 1 \u2212\n, n = 1, 2\n(9)\nM\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u000fn \u2264 1. The error \u000fn is zero in the case of\nperfect cooperative feedback, namely Fin = F\u0302in . A nonzero\nerror results in violation of the orthogonality constraint in (5)\nGim Hmn F\u0302in 6= 0,\n\nm 6= n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe resultant residual interference from Tn to the `th data\nstream of Rm has the power\n[`]\nImn\n:= Pn \u03bdk[Gom ]\u2020` (Gim )\u2020 Hmn F\u0302in Fon k2 ,\n\nm 6= n.\n\n(11)\n\nNext, we choose A and B in (7) by minimizing an upper\nbound on the residual interference power as follows. Based on\n(7), (6) can be rewritten as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2020\nHmn = Bm Gim \u03a3mn Fin Cn\n(12)\n\u0012q\n\u0013\nq\nq\n[1]\n[1]\n[L]\nwhere \u03a3mn := \u03a0 diag\n\u03bbmn , \u03bbmn , * * * , \u03bbmn \u03a0\u2020\nwith \u03a0 being an arbitrary permutation matrix that rearranges\nthe order of the singular values along the matrix diagonal. The\ncolumns of the matrices Bm and Cn comprise the (L \u2212 N )\nleft and (L \u2212 M ) right singular vectors of Hmn , respectively,\nwhich are determined by \u03a0. Let the set Dmn contain the last\nN elements along the diagonal of \u03a3mn .\n\nm 6= n.\n\n\u03b1\u2208Dmn\n\n(13)\n\nReaders can refer to the full paper [12] for the proofs of\nthe above lemma as well as analytical results in the sequel.\nMinimizing the upper bound in (13) gives that Dmn consists\nof the N smallest singular values of Hmn . Equivalently, \u03a0 is\nan identity matrix and thus Gim and Fin are given as\nGim\n\n= {[Vmn ]L\u2212N +1 , [Vmn ]L\u2212N +1 , * * * , [Vmn ]L }\n\nFin\n\n= {[Umn ]1 , [Umn ]2 , * * * , [Umn ]M } .\n\n(14)\n\nThen (13) can be simplified as\n[`]\n+1]\nImn\n\u2264 M \u03bdPn \u03bb[L\u2212N\n\u000fn ,\nmn\n\n\u2200 1 \u2264 ` \u2264 M, m 6= n.\n\n(15)\n\n[`]\n\nNote that the above upper bound on Imn is independent of\nthe stream index `. On one hand, the upper bound reduces\nwith decreasing N . On the other hand, as mentioned earlier,\nlarger N increases link array gain. These opposite effects of N\non link performance make it an important parameter for precoder optimization. Finding the optimal N is mathematically\nintractable but a numerical search is straightforward.\nIV. I NTERFERENCE P OWER C ONTROL F EEDBACK\nA. Fixed Interference Margin\nThe receiver Rm sends the IPC signal, denoted as \u03b7n , to the\ninterferer Tn for controlling its transmission power as\nPn = min(\u03b7n , Pmax ),\n\nn = 1, 2.\n\n(16)\n\nThe scalar \u03b7n is designed to prevent the per-stream interference power at Rm from exceeding a fixed margin \u03c4 with \u03c4 > 0,\n[`]\nnamely Imn \u2264 \u03c4 for all 0 \u2264 ` \u2264 M . A sufficient condition\nfor satisfying such constraints is to upper bound the right hand\nside of (15) by \u03c4 . It follows that\n\u03c4\n, m 6= n.\n(17)\n\u03b7n :=\n[L\u2212N +1]\n\u000fn\nM \u03bd\u03bbmn\nGiven \u03c4 , a lower bound AIM on the sum throughput C\u0304, called\nthe achievable throughput, is obtained from (2) as\n!\n2 X\nM\n[`]\nX\nmin(\u03b7m , Pmax )\u03bbmm\nAIM =\nlog2 1 +\n(18)\n1+\u03c4\nm=1\n`=1\n\nwhere \u03b7m is given (17).\nIt is infeasible to derive the optimal value of \u03c4 for either\nmaximizing AIM in (18) or minimizing Pout in (3). However,\nfor Pmax being either large or small, simple insight into\nchoosing \u03c4 can be derived as follows. The residual interference\npower decreases continuously with reducing Pmax . Intuitively,\n\u03c4 should be kept small for small Pmax . For large Pmax , the\nchoice of \u03c4 is less intuitive since large \u03c4 lifts the constraints\non the transmission power but causes stronger interference and\nvice versa. We show below that large \u03c4 is preferred for large\nPmax . Let \u03bb\u0301k denote the eigenvalue of the Wishart matrix\nHH\u2020 with H being an i.i.d. N \u00d7 M CN (0, 1) matrix.

Sum Throughput Criterion\nIn this section, an iterative IPC algorithm is designed for\nincreasing the sum throughput C\u0304 in (2). Since C\u0304 is a nonconvex function of transmission power, directly maximizing\nC\u0304 does not yield a simple IPC algorithm. Thus, we resort to\nmaximizing a lower bound AST (achievable throughput) on C\u0304\ninstead, obtained from (2) and (15) as AST = E [A] with\n!\n\"\nM\n[`]\nX\nP1 \u03bb11\n+\nA :=\nlog2 1 +\n[L\u2212N +1]\n1 + P2 M \u03bd\u03bb12\n\u000f2\n`=1\n(19)\n!#\n[`]\nP2 \u03bb22\n.\nlog2 1 +\n[L\u2212N +1]\n1 + P1 M \u03bd\u03bb21\n\u000f1\nThus, the optimal transmission power pair is given as\n(P1? , P2? ) =\n\nmax\n\nP1 ,P2 \u2208[0,Pmax ]\n\nAlgorithm 1:\n1) The transmitters T1 and T2 arbitrarily select the initial\nvalues for P1 and P2 , respectively.\n2) The transmitters broadcast their choices of transmission\npower to the receivers.\n3) Given (P1 , P2 ), the receiver R1 computes (\u03bc1 , \u03c82 , \u03c12 )\nand sends \u03bc1 and (\u03c82 \u2212 \u03c12 ) to T1 and T2 , respectively.\nLikewise, R2 computes (\u03bc2 , \u03c81 , \u03c11 ) and feeds back \u03bc2\nand (\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c11 ) to T2 and T1 , respectively.\n4) The transmitters T1 and T2 update P1 and P2 , respectively, using (21) and the following equation\n)\n(\u0014\n\u0015+\n\u2202A(P1 , P2 )\n\u2206\u03b3 , Pmax\nPm (k+1) = min Pm (k) +\n\u2202Pm\nwhere k is the iteration index and \u2206\u03b3 a step size.\n5) Repeat Steps 2) \u2212 4) till the maximum number of\niterations is performed or the changes on (P1 , P2 ) are\nsufficiently small.\nC.

With respect\nto the IPC feedback using increasing \u03c4 or with perfect feedback, Algorithm 2 dramatically decreases average transmission\npower. Moreover, Algorithm 2 yields lower outage probability\nthan the two algorithms using \u03c4 .
