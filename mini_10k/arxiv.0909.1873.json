Although single photon emission has been demonstrated from quantum dots (QD) [1, 2],single molecules [3] and\nnanowires[4], the operation of those systems is often limited by the temperature. Diamond crystals, on the other hand, offer the most promising platform for generation of robust, photo stable,\nsingle photons at room temperature [5, 6]. Nevertheless, out of more than 500 existing optical\ncenters in diamond [7], only three known centers demonstrate single photon emission, namely,\nthe nitrogen-vacancy complex [8, 6], the silicon-vacancy complex [9] and the nickel-nitrogen\ncomplex [10, 11, 12].\nRecent progress in materials science and fabrication techniques of diamond color centers\n[13] unveiled novel quantum emitters operating in the MHz regime [14, 15]. These new centers,\nare comparable to QD in terms of brightness [1], but have the tremendous advantage of stable\noperation at room temperature. These break throughts have opened a new avenue to investigate\nessentially an unknown group of single photon emitters in diamond.\nThe simple two-level nature of a select few single photon emitters allows a direct estimate\nof the collection efficiency associated with the optical setup, the precise knowledge of the collection efficiency can lead to more accurate estimations of the quantum efficiency of the more\ncommon three level single photon emitting systems. This type of source can thus eventually\nbe used as a reference for an absolute characterization of the quantum efficiency along with\nmore precise estimations of the collection efficiency of the system, provided the photo-physics\nis well understood. One can envisage that single photon sources could be implemented as a\n\"single photon standard\", able to link classical radiometric measurements to the fundamental\nquantum optical entities. In particular in the long term such a single photon standard could\ncontribute to a re-definition of the standard units for optical radiation in terms of the \"quantum\ncandela\" [16]. The controlled fabrication of the MHz class of diamond single photon emitters,\ntogether with a recent emission enhancement by coupling the light to plasmonic structures [17]\nor cavities [18], is expected to progress the technology beyond the point in which they can\nbecome practical quantum information and metrology devices.\nIn this paper, a detailed study of the photophysical properties of the novel family of single photon emitters reported in [15] has been undertaken. To gain insight into the electronic\n\n\flevel structure of the emitters, their fundamental optical properties such as lifetime, photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, sub-poissionian statistics and saturation count rate have been\nstudied and compared. We concentrate on the typical PL lines in the range of 740-770 nm,\nwhich exhibit single photon emission with count rates ranging from 1.3-3.2 106 counts/s at\nsaturation.\n2.\n\nTheoretical background\n\nThe physics of the photoluminescence emitted from a single diamond color center can be described within the framework of a two level system comprising a ground and excited state, and\nin many instances as a three-level system [5, 11, 19], whereby the single center is excited from\nits ground state to the excited state, with a third longer lived state providing an additional decay\npath from the excited state, as seen in Fig. 1. The rate equations describing the populations of\n\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of a (a) two-level and (b) three-level system, where rnm n, m =\n1, 2, 3 are the transition rates from level (n) to level (m).\n\nthe two and three level systems can be written in matrix form as:\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nn1\n\u2212r12 r12\nn \u03071\n=\nn2\nr12 \u2212r21\nn \u03072\nand\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\u2212r12\nn \u03071\n\uf8ed n \u03072 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed r12\nn \u03073\n0\n\uf8eb\n\nr21\n\u2212r21 \u2212 r23\nr23\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\nn1\nr31\n0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed n2 \uf8f8 .\nn3\n\u2212r31\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nBy solving Eqs (1) and (2) with the initial condition n1 = 1, n2 = 0, n3 = 0 (i.e the system is\nprepared in the ground state), the instantaneous emission probability of a photon being emitted\nfrom the excited state, n2 (t), can be obtained. By normalizing n2 (t) to the probability of a\nphoton being emitted at an infinite time n2 (\u221e) an analytical expression describing the second\norder correlation function can be obtained. The respective analytical expressions for the two\nand three level [11, 19] cases are then given by:\ng(2) (\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bb1 \u03c4 ).\n\n(3)\n\ng(2) (\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 (1 + a) exp(\u2212\u03bb1 \u03c4 ) + a exp(\u2212\u03bb2 \u03c4 ),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bb1 = r12 + r21 and\n\nwhere \u03bb2 = r31 + r23 r12 /\u03bb1 , and a = r12 r23 /(\u03bb1 r31 ).\nThe decay rate \u03bb1 depends on the excitation optical power, Popt as:\n0\n\u03bb1 = r21\n(1 + \u03b1 Popt),\n\n(5)\n\n\f0\nwhere r21\nis the inverse of the excited state lifetime (\u03c421 ) and \u03b1 is a fitting parameter.\n\nSimilarly, for the three-level system, the decay rate \u03bb2 , assuming r23 constant with the\n0 in the limit of zero optical power.\nexcitation power [11], can be written in terms of r31\n0\n\u03bb2 = r31\n(1 + \u03b2 Popt) +\n\nr23 r12\n,\n0\nr21 (1 + \u03b1 Popt)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is a fitting parameter.\nWith an accurate determination of the second order correlation function one can determine\nthe individual decay rates involved in the system and gain an understanding of the energy level\nstructure. Upon inspection of the two and three level auto-correlation functions there is a clear\ndistinction in the shape and nature of the exponential component. In the two level case the\nfunction exhibits a simple exponential rise at a rate equivalent to the fluorescence decay rate\nof the excited state in the limit of zero optical excitation i.e. r12 \u2192 0, with the exponential\nasymptotic to a g(2) (\u03c4 ) value of 1. The three level expression, on the other hand, contains two\nexponential components each with a characteristic time constant. Depending on the transition\nrates from the excited state to the shelving state and shelving state back to the ground state,\ng(2) (\u03c4 ) can increase beyond 1 for times > \u03c421 , before decaying back to 1 at times >> \u03c421 .\nThe phenomenon of g(2) (\u03c4 )\u00bf1 is commonly termed \"photon bunching\" and this behavior\nenables a clear distinction to be made between two and three level systems. The second order\ncorrelation function describes the probability of detecting a photon with a delay time \u03c4 after one\nphoton has been detected at \u03c4 =0. Hence, the bunching effect describes the enhanced probability\nto detect a photon at short times then at longer times. Indeed after the system undergoes a\ntransition to its shelving state, which has longer lifetime, there is a longer interval between\nthe photons. Once the system relaxed to the ground state and undergo a full emission cycle\nagain, the normal photon rate is achieved again. The waiting interval while the system in the\nmetastable state thus creates the bunching effect of the g(2) (\u03c4 ).\nThe measurement g(2) (\u03c4 ) is done typically using a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometer whereby the coincidence events of two detectors are measured. In practice, the\ntemporal jitter of the detectors and of the electronics can be ignored provided that the lifetime is much longer than the temporal jitter; with the identification of emitting centers with\nincreasing short fluorescence lifetimes [9, 11, 13], the effect of the temporal jitter on the meas(2)\nured auto-correlation function gmeas (\u03c4 ) must be taken into account. Therefore the measured\nauto-correlation function is given by the convolution of Eqs (3,4) with the instrumental time\nresponse function J(\u03c4 ):\nZ\n(2)\n\ngmeas (\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c4 \u2032 g(2) (\u03c4 \u2032 )J(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 ).\n\n(7)\n\nThe majority of single photon emitters identified in diamond (such as: Si-V [9], NV [20] and the\nNE8[10, 11]) have been attributed to three level systems which suffer from quenching due to\nthe presence of a shelving state. However, the recent identification of highly efficient two level\nsystems in diamond [13, 14] has attracted considerable interest, particularly due to its central\nrole in determining more accurately the collection efficiency of the setup and the quantum\nefficiency of three level systems. The quantum efficiency, \u03b7QE , of an emitter is defined as the\nprobability of an absorbed pump photon resulting in emitted photon. For a two level emitter,\nthe quantum efficiency is equal to 1 when r12 >> r21 , indicating that for each absorbed pump\nphoton a photon is emitted from the excited state.\nWe can deduce the number of emitting photons or the fluorescence count rate of a two level\n\n\fsystem by solving the rate equations in Eq. (1):\n\n\u03c6=\n\n\u03c6\u221e Popt\n,\nPsat + Popt\n\n(8)\n\n0 \u03b7 , is the saturation count rate for\nwhere \u03c6 represents the single photon count rate, \u03c6\u221e = r21\nPopt \u2192 \u221e where \u03b7 represents the total collection efficiency and Psat = \u03b1 \u22121 is the optical saturation power.\nIn the three level case the quantum efficiency can be derived analytically in terms of the\ndetected fluorescence rate by solving the rate equations in Eq. (2):\n\n\u03c6 = \u03b7QE \u00d7 \u03b7\n3.\n\nr21\n.\n21\n+ rr23\n1 + rr12\n31\n\n(9)\n\nExperiment\n\nThe CVD diamond crystals employed in this work were grown to an average size of few hundreds nanometers from diamond seeds (4-6 nm) on a sapphire substrate using a microwave\nplasma enhanced CVD technique (900 W, 150 Torr)[21]. A home built confocal microscope\nwith a spatial resolution \u223c 400 nm and HBT interferometer were used to identify the emitting\ncenters and measure the time correlation of photoluminescence (PL) intensity (Fig. 2(a)). A\nfiber coupled CW diode laser emitting at 682 nm and a 690 nm pulsed diode 200 ps pulse width\n(repetition rate from 10 MHz up to 80 MHz) were interchanged for excitation. The lasers polarization was controlled by a Glan Taylor polarizer and a half-wave plate. The diamond sample\nwas mounted on a piezo XYZ stage with 0.2 nm resolution, allowing 100x100 \u03bc m2 scans. The\nunwanted residual laser line was eliminated by a dichroic beam splitter and a F1 broad (10 nm\nFWHM) band-pass filter centred at 740 nm, 749 nm or 760 nm depending on the PL from a\nspecific crystal. The PL from the emitting centers was then coupled into a 62.5 \u03bc m core multimode fiber, which acts as an aperture. A 50:50 fibre coupled beam splitter guided the photons\nto two single photon counting detectors (APDs) and their outputs were sent to the start and stop\ninputs of the time correlator card. The PL was recorded without the bandpass F1 filter using a\nfiber-coupled spectrometer with a cooled CCD array. All the measurements were performed at\nroom temperature.\n4.\n\nResults\n\nMore than 10 different sapphire substrates were scanned, with crystals grown to a size of a few\nhundred nanometers. Fig. 2b shows a typical confocal map of the diamond crystals obtained\nby 682 nm laser excitation. The PL spectra of the bright spots revealed emission with zero\nphonon lines (ZPLs) centered at 744\u00b12 nm (FWHM \u223c 11nm),749\u00b12 nm (FWHM \u223c 4nm),\n756\u00b12 nm (FWHM \u223c 11 nm), and 764\u00b12 nm (FWHM \u223c 10 nm), as shown in Fig. 3. In some\ncases two or more of these lines were found in one crystal, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.\nAnti-bunching measurements on crystals containing multiple emission lines generally showed\nmultiple emitters with auto-correlation functions at the zero delay time of g(2) (0) > 0.5, with\nthe intensity of the lines varying from crystal to crystal. These characteristic emission lines\nare in agreement with cathodo-luminescence lines from chromium related centers in diamond,\nexhibiting narrow lines in the region of 740-770 nm [22].\nFigure 4(a-d) show the antibunching behavior of the PL lines centered at 744 nm, 749 nm,\n756 nm and 764 nm measured with the HBT interferometer for excitation powers below and\nabove the optical saturation power Psat . The dip at zero delay time indicates a single photon\nemitter. The raw coincidence data were corrected for the background as described in ref. [6].\n\n\fFig. 2. (a)Experimental setup. A diode laser at 682 nm operating in CW and a pulsed 690\nnm laser were alternatively coupled to a single mode fiber, and then collimated (C) and\npolarized by a Glan Taylor polarizer (GTP). The laser polarization was varied by an halfwave plate (\u03bb /2). A variable neutral density filter (NDF) was used to change the excitation\npower. Samples (S) were excited by focusing the laser light by a high numerical aperture\n(0.9) objective with 100x magnification. A dichroic mirror (DM)transmitting from 720 nm,\nwas used to separate the laser line form the sample fluorescence emission, when collected\nback from the same Obj. F1,2 are band-pass filters, 794\u00b180 nm and alternatively 760\u00b112\nnm or 740\u00b112 nm, to isolate the single photon emission lines. A 100 mm focal length\nlens was used to send the single photon emission to a multimode-fiber, providing an aperture for the confocal imaging. Finally a 50:50 fiber beam splitter was used to verify the\nsingle photon emission by performing the auto-correlation between two low-dark counts\n(150 counts/s) single photon counting modules (APD). The S were mounted on a Physics\nInstruments XYZ piezo stage in closed loop operation. (b) Confocal image of 20x20 \u03bc m2\nshowing bright spots which corresponds to a color center within a diamond crystal.\n\nDue to the observed bunching, the center with a ZPL at 749 nm was fit by Eq.(4) and\nEq.(7),which describes three level model. The other three centers, which exhibit two level behavior, were fit by Eq.(3) and Eq.(7). The deviation from zero of the auto-correlation function\nis attributed to the jitter of the electronics and detectors and residual polarisation dependent\nbackground.\n(2)\nThe gmeas (0) of the 744, 749, 756 and 764 nm centers were 0.44, 0.16, 0.2, and 0.09, respectively. The excited state lifetime of the 744, 756 and 764 nm emitters were 3.8, 3.7 and 13 ns,\nrespectively and were obtained by extrapolating the decay rate \u03bb1 to zero optical power, refer\nto Eq. 5, see Fig. 5. The fit applied to the second order correlation function for the 749 nm\nemitter contains two exponential decay rates \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 . The extrapolation of these rates to zero\noptical excitation allows the excited state lifetime and shelving decay rates to be determined.\nThe decay rate \u03bb2 as a function of optical power is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The resulting\n0 and r are 6.2 MHz and 0.89 MHz, respectively and are much smaller than the\nvalues of r31\n23\n0 =880 MHz (\u03c4 = 1.1 ns).\nexcited state decay rate, obtained from \u03bb1 , r21\n21\nThe single photon emission count rate as a function of optical power Popt is shown for each\nemitter in Fig.6. The measured count rates (corrected for the background) are given by the sum\nof the counts on the two APDs in the HBT setup. For the 744, 756 and 764 nm emitters, the\nsaturation curves were fit according to Eq.(8) yielding saturation count rates \u03c6\u221e of 2.1\u00d7106,\n3.2\u00d7106 and 1.3\u00d7106 counts/s, respectively. The saturation curve of the three level 749 nm\n(2)\nemitter was fit using Eq.(9), with the values of r21 , r12 , r31 , r23 obtained from the fit to gmeas (\u03c4 )\nas a function of pump power and the value \u03b7 obtained as discussed in the following text.

Typical PL spectra recorded from individual CVD diamond crystals as shown in the\nraster scan of the sample in Fig. 1. The peak emission lines centred at 744 nm (red), 749\nnm (blue), 756 nm (green) and 764 mn (black). Similar emission lines were also found all\ntogether in one crystal (inset).\n\nsingle fitting parameter \u03b7QE was then obtained from a least squares fit to the saturation curve.\nFigure 7 shows a direct measurement of the lifetime recorded from the emitters using the\npulsed excitation at 20 MHz repetition rate. The single exponential fit to the fluorescence decay\nof each emitter, resulted in measured excited state lifetimes of 4.1 ns, 1.4 ns and 14.2 ns for the\n744 nm, 749 nm and 764 nm centres, respectively. Upon inspection of the fluorescence decay of\nthe 744 and 749 nm centres there is a fast component of the fluorescence decay which occurs on\na time scale less than 0.5 ns, this component is attributed to the background within the emitting\ncrystal. The lifetime of the emitter is this case is determined by fitting the fluorescence decay\nfor times greater than 0.5 ns. The long fluorescence lifetime of the 764 nm centre mitigates this\neffect and the decay can be described well by the single exponential fit. The measured lifetimes\nare in a good agreement with the lifetimes estimated from the CW measurements for the 744\nnm and 749 nm emitters. The discrepancy with the 764 nm centre can be due to the lack of the\nCW g(2) (\u03c4 ) measurements at excitation powers well below saturation, which affects the fit to a\nzero excitation power.\nIn the inset of Fig. 7 is an example of the second order correlation function measurement\nunder pulsed excitation from the 749 nm emitting crystal. The peak at \u03c4 =0 is the probability of having two photons in the same pulse, indicating in this case the presence of only one\nphoton(g(2)(0) = 0.17). The observed deviation from zero is due the background luminescence\nfrom the diamond crystals, which is not negligible in this case. A pulsed measurement is mandatory for quantum optics application since single photons on demand (triggered single photons)\nare required. To reduce the unwanted background for practical application, temporal filtering\nof our single photon source can be implemented.\nThe total collection efficiency, \u03b7 , of our setup can been measured directly by exciting a\n\n\f(2)\n\nFig. 4. Background corrected second-order auto-correlation function gmeas (\u03c4 ), measured\nwith 154 ps coincidence time bin for 300 s at different optical powers for the (a) 744 nm\nline, (b) 749 nm line the (c) 756 nm line and the (d) 764 nm line. The data of the 749 nm\nline was fit by Eq.(4,7), while the data of the 744 nm, 756 nm and 764 nm lines were fit by\nEq.(3,7). The number to the right of the curves correspond to Popt /Psat\n\ntwo level emitter in the pulsed regime. The total collection efficiency can be described by\n\u03b7 = \u03b7opt \u00d7 \u03b7det \u00d7 \u03b7 \u03b8 \u00d7 \u03b7cr , where \u03b7opt corresponds to the optical transmittance, \u03b7det is the\ndetection efficiency, \u03b7\u03b8 corresponds to the geometrical efficiency, associated to the matching\nbetween the collection optics numerical aperture and the source spatial distribution and \u03b7cr\naccounts for the crystal geometry, that contributes to the orientation of the excitation dipole of\nthe center with respect to the excitation electric field and the emission dipole with respect to\nthe collection optics. These are the limiting parameters that reduce the collection efficiency of\nthe source down to typically a few percent.\nIn the case of a two-level system the total collection efficiency can be measured directly, as\neach excitation pulse generates one emitted photon (without being trapped in the metastable\nstate), hence the absence of detected photons is a directly related to \u03b7 . In the condition where\nthe laser excitation energy is above saturation, the laser pulses temporal separation is longer\nthan the typical detectors dead time (50 ns) and the source lifetime (14.2 ns), the total collection efficiency can be directly measured from the total count rate and the laser repetition\nrate \u03b7 = \u03c6 /Rrep . As an example, exciting the 764 nm with a laser repetition rate of 10 MHz,\n0 ). By calculating\n\u03b7 =1.5% is obtained. Similarly, in the CW regime, \u03b7 is given by \u03b7 = \u03c6\u221e /(r21\n\u03b7 for each two level emitter, an average value of \u03b7 =1.3% is obtained. The discrepancy in the\nvalue of collection efficiency for various two level emitters may be attributed to a variation\nin \u03b7cr due to the unknown dipole orientation of the emitter within the crystal and/or residual\npolarisation dependent background, that can influence the total saturation count rate \u03c6\u221e . The\naccuracy of \u03b7cr can be improved by engineering centers with a known dipole orientation and\n\n\fFig. 5.

The data were fit with Eq.(5). The behavior of \u03bb2 versus\nthe optical power of the emitters at 749 nm is also shown inset and fit with Eq.(6); the\n0 =6.2 MHz (161 ns), and r =0.89 MHz (1.1 \u03bc s), \u03b1 = 2.5 mW\u22121 ,\nestimated values r31\n23\n\u03b2 = 3.1 mW\u22121 .\n\nlower fluorescent background. A detailed analysis of the various parameters of the collection\nefficiency, which is beyond the scope of the paper, is however important to exploit fully the twolevel system properties for improving measurement accuracy. After identifying the collection\nefficiency \u03b7 =1.3%, the quantum efficiency \u03b7QE =0.24 of the 749 nm emitter is derived from the\nfit to the saturation curve with Eq.(9).\nA summary of the photo-physics parameters for each single emitter is shown in Table 1.\nThe ratio between the average off and on periods of the source is given by the ratio r23 /r31\nTable 1.

This value indicates that the probability of transition\nto the metastable state is moderate, as shown by the slight bunching of the g(2) (\u03c4 ) function (Fig.\n4b). Previous determinations associated to NE8 complex in bulk natural diamond IIa [10, 11],\nand CVD nanodiamond [12] showed r23 /r31 of 2.8, 1.6 and 0.8 respectively, justifying much\nlower saturation rates of NE8 with respect to the 749 nm center.

For the center at 749 nm (blue diamonds) the\nsaturation curve was fit by Eq.(9) with the estimated values r21 , r12 , r31 , r23 and \u03b7 . From\nthe fit a quantum efficiency of \u03b7QE =0.24 is obtained.\n\nmoderately low quantum efficiency.\nIn general two level emitters possessed a ZPL with a FWHM of \u223c 10 nm, whilst the three\nlevel emitters exhibited a FWHM of \u223c 4 nm. The variation of the lifetime (4 ns to 14 ns) of\nthe two level system emitters can be attributed to nanocrystals geometry experiencing local\nmodification of electric field and/or differences in the atomic structure.\nThe single emitting centres in the range 740-770 nm are believed to arise from chromium\natoms within the diamond lattice. The charge state of the chromium complex and number of\natoms involved is unknown. The explanation of what leads to two or three level behavior of a\nparticular crystal is still under investigation. One may assume that the strain within the crystal\nmay have a significant effect. Indeed, it was shown for NV centers that strain can modify the\ntransition from being spin conserving to a \u039b system geometry[23]. Similarly, the strain can\nmodify the electronic transition and enhance/suppress the relaxation to a third metastable state.\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nA full optical characterization of the photophysics of novel optical centers attributed to\nchromium related defects in sub-micron CVD grown diamond crystals was performed. Novel\ntwo-level systems with ZPLs at 744 and 764nm, were identified and characterized. The direct measurement of the total collection efficiency from the two level systems enabled a more\naccurate determination of the quantum efficiency of the three level single emitter at 749 nm\n(\u03b7QE =0.24).\nThe spectral width of the two level emitters was \u223c 10 nm, whilst the three level emitter\nexhibited a FWHM of \u223c 4 nm. This coupled with the short excited state lifetimes (1-14 ns) and\n\n\f1.07\n\n1.03\n\n2\n\n( )\n\n1\ng\n\nFlouresence Intensity (arb. units)\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.17\n\n764 nm\n\n0.0\n-60\n\n-30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\ndelay time (ns)\n\n0.1\n\n744 nm\n\n749 nm\n\n0.01\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ndecay time (ns)\n\nFig. 7.
