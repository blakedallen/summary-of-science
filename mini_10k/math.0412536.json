Stefanov \u0003\nDepartment of Mathematics\nPurdue University\nWest Lafayette, IN 47907\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and Main Results\n\nLet P be a compactly supported perturbation of the Laplacian in Rn , n odd, defined by the \"black box scattering\"\nformalism, i.e., P D \u0081 outside B(0, R0 ) and P satisfies the hypotheses in [SjZ2], see section 2. As usual, P ]\ndenotes a reference operator on the \"perturbed torus\" TR , R > R0 , see next section. Let N(r ) be the number of\nresonances (scattering poles) of P with modulus less than r . One of the basic questions in the theory of resonances\nis to estimate N(r ) and, if possible, to find an asymptotic formula, as r ! 1. In a pioneering work, Melrose [M1]\nshowed that N(r ), related to P D \u0081 C V (x), where the potential V is compactly supported, has at most polynomial\ngrowth, and in an unpublished note later he improved this to N(r ) \u0014 C r nC1 , r > 1. Then he showed [M2] that\nN(r ) \u0014 Ar n\n\n(1)\n\nin obstacle scattering. M. Zworski [Z2] proved (1) for compactly supported potentials. The case of elliptic second\norder P 's was resolved by G. Vodev in [V1], and in [V2] for non-self-adjoint operators. In a general black-box setting,\na generalization of (1) was proved by Sj\u00f6strand and Zworski [SjZ1]. Similar bounds are known in the semiclassical\ncase, see e.g., [PZ2] for references. Bounds on a modified version of N(r ) in even dimensions were studied in [I],\n[V3], [V4].\nIt is known that the distribution of the scattering poles in various neighborhoods of the real axis depends on the\ngeometry of the scatterer, respectively on the properties of the Hamiltonian flow associated with P . We will not give\nfull account of those results and will mention only [SjZ2], [Ze] where scattering poles in sectors 0 < arg \u0015 \u001c 1 are\nstudied, and [S2] for upper bounds in fj\u0015j > 1I =\u0015 \u0014 j\u0015j N g, N \u001d 1.\nAt present, very little is known about a possible asymptotic formula for N(r ). In the 1D case, for P D d2 =dx 2 C\nV (x), it is known [Z1] that\n2a\nN(r ) D\nr C o(r ),\n(2)\n\u0019\nwhere a is the diameter of the support of V . For n \u0015 3 odd, and P D \u0081 C V (x), M. Zworski [Z3] proved that\nN(r ) D Kn Rn r n (1 C o(1)),\nunder the assumption that V 2 C 2 is radial, supported in B(0, R), and V has a jump at jxj D R (see also Theorem 3\nbelow). His proof also implies an asymptotic of the same kind with a different constant for the sphere resonances with\nDirichlet boundary conditions (see also Theorem 1 below). The constant Kn in (2) is not specified in [Z3] 1 .\nThe purpose of this work is to find an explicit constant An such that\nN(r ) \u0014 An r n C o(r n )\n\u0003 Supported\n1 Actually,\n\nby NSF Grant DMS-0400869\nan integral representation of Kn of the kind we obtain is implicit in [Z3], see the proof of Theorem 3.\n\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\ffor various P 's, and to show that in some special cases, including those above, An is sharp because then (3) turns into\nan asymptotic. The term An r n would then serve as a candidate for the leading term in the asymptotics of N(r ), if the\nlatter exists, at least if the scatterer is spherically symmetric. In the case studied in [Z3], one can see that the constant\nKn Rn depends on the size of the support of V only, and not on V itself. This corresponds well to the known fact that\nthe scattering determinant s(\u0015) related to general P 's, admits an estimate of the kind js(\u0015)j \u0014 Cn0 exp(A0n j\u0015jn ) in the\n\"physical plane\" =\u0015 > 0 [PZ2].\nSince we use Jensen's type of equality, this forces us to work with a regularized version M(r ) of N(r ), instead of\nN(r ):\nZ r\nX\nN(t)\nr\nM(r ) D n\nlog\ndt D n\n,\n(4)\nt\nj\u0015j j\n0\nj\u0015j j<r\n\nwhere \u0015j are the resonances. The factor n above can be explained by the following: M(r ) has asymptotic if and only\nif N(r ) has asymptotics, and then the leading terms coincide, see Lemma 1. In all cases, N(r ) \u0014 eM(r ) but then the\nfactor e probably makes the estimate for N(r ) non-sharp.\nIn order to state our main results, introduce the function\np\n1 C 1 z2 p\n\u001a(z) D log\n1 z 2 , j arg zj < \u0019,\nz\nsee section 4 for more details. We denote [ <\u001a]C D max( <\u001a, 0). Then in CC WD f=z > 0g, the function [ <\u001a]C\nis supported outside an eye-like domain K, see Figure 1 in section 4.\nWe study first the case of P D \u0081 in jxj > R0 with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The resonances in this\ncase are well known to be the zeros of Hl(1)\n(\u0015R0 ), l D 0, 1, . . . with multiplicities equal to the dimension of\nCn=2 1\nthe corresponding spherical harmonics eigenspace and their asymptotics follow from Olver's uniform asymptotics of\nHankel's functions, see Figure 2 in section 7. The asymptotic of the counting function however, to our best knowledge,\nhas not been studied except for [Z3], as mentioned above.\nTheorem 1 Let NR0 S n 1 (r ), n odd, be the counting function of the resonances for the exterior Dirichlet problem for\nthe sphere R0 S n 1 , R0 > 0.

Another integral representation of AS n 1 is given in Lemma 4 below.\nWe find it more convenient to work with a reference operator P ] equal to P in B(0, R), where R > R0 is fixed,\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions on jxj D R (to be more precise, \"in B(0, R)\" means on HR0  \u030a L2 (B(0, R) n\nB(0, R0 )), see next section). In most interesting cases, taking the limit R ! R0 would provide the best estimates.\nFrom now on, P ] is that operator, and R > R0 is fixed.\nRecall that one of our assumptions is that N ] (r C 1) N ] (r ) D o(r n ), see section 2. One can impose this\nassumption either on the torus reference operator, or on the ball reference operator.\nFor convenience, set\n\u001cn D (2\u0019) n vol2 (B(0, 1)).\n(6)\nNext theorem is the main result of the paper. It gives an upper bound for M(r ) for general P 's.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 2 Let P satisfy the black-box assumptions in the ball B(0, R0 ) described in section 2, n odd, with a reference operator P ] in B(0, R), with arbitrary but fixed R > R0 .

The factor 2 is explained by the fact that each\neigenvalue \u00152 has two square roots: \u0015 and \u0015, and resonances are symmetric about iR. In fact, we have a stronger\nestimate with the extra term 2(Rn Rn0 )\u001cn r n in the r.h.s. of the second inequality in the theorem that makes the\nprincipal terms independent of R. Since the main application of this estimate however is to take th elimit R ! R0 C,\nthis term does not add anything new unless one needs sharper estimates on the remainder term.\n]\nOne can assume more generally that N ] (r ) D O(r n ) with some n] > n. Then the result is still true with a\n]\n]\nremainder o(r n ). Then we recover the asymptotic formula for N(r ) in case that N ] (r )=r n \u0015 1=C , see [V5] and\n[Sj1]: N(r ) D 2N ] (r )(1 C o(r )). It is known that outside any sector near the real line, the resonances are O(r n ), so\nthe asymptotic is valid actually in any fixed sector around R, as in those works. Also, a \"bottle type\" theorem can be\ndeduced from (7) but it would not add anything new to the results in [Sj1].\nConsider the following examples:\n(i) PO D \u0081 in the domain  \u030b D Rn n O with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, where O \u001a B(0, R0 ),\n@O 2 C 1;\n(ii) PV D\n\n\u0081 C V (x), V 2 L1, supp V \u001a B(0, R0 );\n\n(iii) Pg,c D c 2 \u0081g , where \u0081g is the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with a smooth metric g, 0 < c D c(x)\nis smooth, such that g D \u0131ij , c D 1 outside B(0, R0 ).\nCorollary 1 In cases (i), (ii), (iii), one has\nM(r ) \u0014 2A] r n C AS n\nwhere\n\n8\n\u02c6\n< (2\u0019)\n(2\u0019)\nA] D\n:\u0302 (2\u0019)\n\n1\n\nRn0 r n C o(r n ),\n\nR\ndx d\u0018,\nRx2B(0,R0 )nO, j\u0018j\u00141\nn\ndx\nd\u0018,\nRjxj\u0014R0 , j\u0018j\u00141\nn\nn\n\nP\n\njxj\u0014R0 ,\n\nc 2 (x)g ij (x)\u0018i \u0018j \u00141\n\ndx d\u0018,\n\nif P D PO ,\nif P D PV ,\nif P D Pg,c .\n\nTheorem 1 above shows that the estimate above is sharp in case (i). Next theorem, proven in [Z2] (see the remarks\nabove), shows that our estimate is sharp in case (ii) as well.\nTheorem 3 Let V (x) D v(jxj) be a radially symmetric potential in Rn , n odd,\nv 2 C 2 ([0, R0 ]),\n\nv(R0 ) 6D 0,\n\nand let V be extended as 0 for jxj > R0 .

Fix 0 < c 6D 1, and let\ncQ2 (x)\u0081,\n\nP D\n\nwhere c(x)\nQ\nD c for jxj \u0014 R0 , c(x)\nQ\nD 1 otherwise,\n\nwith domain H 2 (Rn ) (that corresponds to transmission conditions requiring that u and @u=@\u0017 agree on jxj D R0 ).\nThe operator P is self-adjoint on L2 (Rn , cQ 2 dx) and satisfies the black-box assumptions. Resonances of P in strips\nnear the real axis for general strictly convex domains and P 's of variable coefficients have been studied by Cardoso,\nPopov and Vodev, see [CPV] and the references there. If c < 1, then there are resonances converging rapidly to the real\naxis; if c > 1 there is a resonance free zone =\u0015 \u0014 (C j<\u0015j) 1 , j<\u0015j > C . This can be explained by the existence,\nin the case c < 1, of totally reflected rays in the interior, close enough to tangent ones to the boundary. In both cases,\nthere is a Weyl type of asymptotic in the strip 0 \u0014 =\u0015 \u0014 C with a suitable C . We refer to [CPV] for more results\nand details. We are concerned here with all the resonances however and we show that for all admissible values of c,\nthe estimate in Theorem 2 turns into asymptotic, as R !

In particular, if \u001fK is the characteristic function of K \u001b B(0, R0 ),\nwe use the notation \u001fK D 1K . Assume that the restriction of D to Rn n B(0, R0 ) is included in H 2 (Rn n B(0, R0 )),\nand conversely, every u 2 H 2 (Rn n B(0, R0 )) vanishing near B(0, R0 ) belongs to D. The operator P is a compactly\nsupported perturbation of the Laplacian, i.e.,\nP ujRnnB(0,R0 ) D\n\n\u0081ujRn nB(0,R0 ) .\n\nWe also require that\n1B(0,R0 ) (P C i)\n\nm0\n\nto be trace class for some m0 > 0 (see [C]).\nWe define a reference operator P ] as follows. Fix R > R0 and let TR be the flat torus obtained by identifying the\nopposite sides of fx 2 Rn I jxi j < R, i D 1, . . . , ng. Let PT] be the selfadjoint operator defined by\nPT] u D P\u001fu C \u0081TR (1\n\n\u001f)u,\n\n(8)\n]\n\nwhere \u001f D 1 near B(0, R0 ), supp \u001f \u001a B(0, R), and \u0081TR is the Laplacian on TR . Then PT is independent on the\nchoice of \u001f. Our assumptions guarantee that PT] has discrete spectrum only, and we set\nn\no\nNT] (r ) D # \u0015j I \u0015j2 is an eigenvalue of PT] , 0 \u0014 \u0015j \u0014 r ,\n(9)\n]\n\nincluding multiplicities.

As shown in [C], up to o(r n ), NT (r ) \u001cn r n is independent of the choice\nof R > 0, and in most interesting cases can be expressed by Weyl terms related to P only, see Corollary 1 and its\nproof. The asymptotics (11) generalizes earlier results in the classical situations and uses techniques developed by\nRobert [R].\nInstead of the reference operator defined above, we consider a reference operator defined in HR0  \u030a L2 (B(0, R) n\nB(0, R0 )), where R > R0 is fixed. We define PB to be equal to P on that space and satisfy Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on jxj D R (in other words, we use an obvious modification of (8)). The results in [C], see Proposition 2.1\n]\n]\nthere that also holds for manifolds with boundary, imply that NT (r ) \u001cQn r n D NB (r ) Rn \u001cn C o(r n ). From now on,\n]\n]\nwe use PB as a reference operator and will drop the subscript B, i.e., we will denote P ] D PB , and N ] (r ) is as in (9)\nbut related to P ].

The resolvent R(\u0015) D (P \u00152 ) 1 W Hcomp ! Hloc\nadmits a meromorphic continuation from the upper half-plane =\u0015 > 0, where it has poles at i\u0016j only, into the whole\ncomplex plane (for n odd), see e.g., [SjZ1] or [Sj2]. We will denote this continuation by R(\u0015). The poles in =\u0015 < 0\nare called resonances.\nWe recall some facts about scattering theory for black boxes, see e.g., [PZ1], [S3] where this is done in the semiclassical setting and we will translate this into the classical setting.\nFix R1,2,3 such that R0 < R1 < R2 < R3 , and choose a smooth cut-off function \u001f1 such that \u001f1 D 1 on\nB(0, R1 ), and \u001f1 D 0 outside B(0, R2 ). For any \u0012 2 S n 1 , and any \u0015 > 0, we are looking for a solution (x, \u0012, \u0015)\nto the problem (P \u00152 ) D 0, 2 Dloc (P ) such that\nD (1\nwith\nThen\n\nsc\n\n\u001f1 )e i\u0015\u0012 \u0001x C\n\nsc ,\n\nsatisfying the Sommerfeld outgoing condition at infinity: (@=@r\n(x, \u0012, \u0015) D e i\u0015\u0012 \u0001x C\n\ni\u0015)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010x\n\u0011\n1\n,\nA\n,\n\u0012,\n\u0015\nC\nO\n1)=2\nr\nr (nC1)=2\n\ne i\u0015r\nr (n\n\n(13)\nsc\n\nD O(r\n\n(nC1)=2\n\n), as r D jxj ! 1.\n\nas r D jxj ! 1.\n\n(14)\n\nThe function A(!, \u0012, \u0015) is the scattering amplitude related to P . In order to justify this definition, we will show that\nsc is well defined and the limit above exists.\nBefore proceeding, we will recall the definition for outgoing solution in the case that \u0015 is not necessarily real\nthat we will need later. In short, \"outgoing\" function is a function equal for large x to R0 (\u0015)f for some compactly\nsupported f . Here R0 (\u0015) W Hcomp ! Hloc is the outgoing free resolvent, i.e., the analytic continuation of R0 (\u0015) D\n( \u0081 \u00152 ) 1 from the upper half-plane into the lower half-plane in C. The extension from the lower to the upper half\nplane is called incoming.\nDefinition 1 Given \u0015 2 C, we say that the function u is \u0015-outgoing (or simply, outgoing, if \u0015 is understood from the\ncontext), if there exists a > 0 and f 2 Hcomp such that ujjxj>a D R0 (\u0015)f jjxj>a.\nSimilarly one defines incoming functions.\n\n5\n\n\fProposition 1 ([S1], see also Lemma 1 in [Z4])\n(a) For any f 2 Hcomp and any \u0015 not a resonance, the function u D R(\u0015)f is \u0015-outgoing. Moreover, if \u001f is a\nsmooth cut-off function such that \u001f D 1 for jxj > a, and \u001f D 0 in a neighborhood of B(0, R0 ) and supp f , then we\nhave R(\u0015)f jjxj>a D R0 (\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f]R(\u0015)f jjxj>a .\n(b) Assume u 2 Dloc (P ), (P \u00152 )u D f 2 Hcomp , \u0015 is not a resonance, and u is \u0015-outgoing.

Let t E \u0307(\u0015) be the transpose operators defined as\noperator with Schwartz kernels t E(x, !) D E(!, x). Then viewing the scattering amplitude as an operator A(\u0015) on\nL2 (S n 1 ) with kernel A(!, \u0012, \u0015), we recover the formula for A in [PZ2] modulo normalizing factors:\nA(\u0015) D\n\n1\ne\n2\n\ni\u0019 n 4 3\n\n(2\u0019)\n\nnC1\n2\n\n\u0015\n\nn\n\n3\n2\n\nThe scattering matrix S(\u0015) is an operator on L2 (S n\n\n1\n\nE (\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f2 ]R(\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f1 ] t EC (\u0015).\n) and the kernel of S\n\n\u0012\na(!, \u0012, \u0015) WD\n\ni\u0015\n2\n4\u0019\n\n(20)\n\nI is given by\n\n\u0013 n2 1\nA(!, \u0012, \u0015).\n\nTherefore,\nS(\u0015) D I C cn \u0015n\n\n2\n\nE (\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f2 ]R(\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f1 ] t EC (\u0015),\n6\n\ncn D\n\ni(2\u0019)\n\nn (1 n)=2\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\n\fNote that one can replace E (\u0015) by E (\u0015)1fR2 <jxj<R3g , and t EC (\u0015) by 1fR1<jxj<R2g t EC (\u0015) above.\nThe scattering poles (resonances) are defined as the poles of S(\u0015) in the lower halfplane =\u0015 < 0.

The reason we sketch this proof is to explain the main idea in the proof of Theorem 2.\nTo estimate the scattering determinant s(\u0015), we proceed in the usual way, see for example [PZ2]. By (21), we need\nto estimate the characteristic values of S(\u0015) I , which equals A(\u0015) modulo polynomial factors, see (20) and (21).\nThis reduces to an estimate of the characteristic values of the operators E (\u0015)1R2 <jxj<R3 , and 1R1<jxj<R2 EC (\u0015), see\nthe remark after (21), and the latter can be done by estimating\ni\u0015x\u0001\u0012\n\u0081m\n,\n\u0012 e\n\njxj \u0014 R3 .\n\nWe need to work here in a sector 0 < \u0131 \u0014 arg \u0015 \u0014 \u0019 \u0131. Using a standard argument, to cover the missing sectors\n0 \u0014 arg \u0015 \u0014 \u0131 and \u0019 \u0131 \u0014 arg \u0015 \u0014 \u0019, we use the fact that jsj D 1 on R and the Phragm\u00e9n-Lindel\u00f6f principle.\nMore precisely, assume that R3 D 1 and that in the representation (21), the cut-off functions \u001f1 and \u001f2 are so\nthat they are supported in B(0, 1). Then the statement for any R3 > 0 would follow by a scaling argument. In what\nfollows, 0 < \u0131 \u0014 arg \u0015 \u0014 \u0019 \u0131 for some 0 < \u0131 < 1=(n C 1) and j\u0015j \u0015 1. Note that kR(\u0015)k \u0014 C =j\u0015j2 \u0014 C for \u0015 in\nthis region, so in (21), we have\n[\u0081, \u001f2 ]R(\u0015)[\u0081, \u001f1 ] e i\u0015\u0012 \u0001\u000f 2 n \u0014 Ce j\u0015j\n(26)\nL (R )\n\nwith C > 0 depending on \u0131 only and in particular, independent of P .

As mentioned above, using Phragm\u00e9n-Lindel\u00f6f principle, we extend\nthis to =\u0015 \u0015 0.\nThe main idea behind the proof of Theorem 2 is the following. To get an explicit value for C , we notice that\nby a well known expansion of e i\u0015x\u0001\u0012 in spherical harmonics and Bessel functions J\u0017 , see Lemma 3, one can find\nthe characteristic values of E (\u0015)1R2 <jxj<R3 , and 1R1<jxj<R2 EC (\u0015) explicitly in terms of J\u0017 (r ), see (46). In the\nspherically symmetric cases (i), (ii), (iii), this in fact gives not only an upper bound, but an asymptotic of the integral\nterm in (25).\n\n4\n\nPreliminaries about Bessel's functions\n\nWe will recall some facts about separation of variables in polar coordinates for the Laplace operator, see e.g., [Fo],\nand some asymptotics of Bessel's functions, see [O1], [O2], [O3].

Let RQ 3 2 (R0 , R0 C 1) be such that C0 (RQ n3 Rn0 ) \u0014 \u000f=2. Let r0 be such that  \u0328\u0012 ,RQ 3 (r ) \u0014 \u000f=2 for\nr \u0015 r0 and all \u0012 as above. Then \u02c7(r ) \u0014 \u000f for r \u0015 r0 . In other words, \u02c7(r ) ! 1, as r ! 1, and f\u0012 (r ) \u0014 \u02c7(r ) for\nall \u0012 as above. This completes the proof of (a).\nTo prove (b), notice that since the scattering operator is unitary for real \u0015, we have log js( \u0307r )j D 0. Also, we\nn\nhave the rather rough a priori estimate js(\u0015)j \u0014 Ce C j\u0015j in =\u0015 > 0, see e.g., [PZ2]. Since the function r n sin(n\u0012)\ni\u0012\nis harmonic in \u0015 D r e , we can apply the Phragm\u00e9n-Lindel\u00f6f principle to the harmonic function log js(r e i\u0012 )j\nAr n sin(n\u0012) in the sector 0 \u0014 \u0012 \u0014 \u000f0 with A D 2Rn0 hn (\u000f0 )= sin(n\u000f0 ) to get\nlog js(r e i\u0012 )j \u0014 2Rn0 hn (\u000f0 )\n\nsin(n\u0012) n\nr ,\nsin(n\u000f0 )\n\nfor r \u001d 1, 0 \u0014 \u0012 \u0014 \u000f0 .\n\n(55)\n\n2\n\nSince hn (\u0012) ! 0, as \u0012 ! 0, this proves part (b) of the Theorem.\nSet\n@KC WD @K \\ f=z \u0015 0g.\nLemma 4\nAS n\n\n1\n\n2\n1\nD\n\u0019 n(n 2)!\n\nZ\n@KC\n\nj1\n\n(56)\n\nz 2 j1=2\njzjnC1\n\njdzj.\n\nProof: We start with formula (5). Set u D <\u001a. Then u is a C 1 function in the closure of CC n K. Indeed, this is\ntrue at z D 1 because \u001a D 2\u0010 3=2 =3, and \u0010 is analytic there. It is also true at ( 1, 1] as well, because u( zN ) D u(z).\nInside that domain, u is harmonic. On the other hand, \u0081n 2jzj n D jzj n 2 , where \u0081 is the Laplacian in R2 that we\n\n14\n\n\fidentify with C 2. Now, we view the integrand in (5) as u\u0081n 2jzj n , and apply Green's formula in CC n K using the\nfact that u D O(jzj), ru D O(1), as jzj ! 1. Since u D 0 on the boundary, we get\nZ\nZ\nZ 1\n[ <\u001a]C (z)\n@u 1\n@u 1\ndx dy D\njdzj C 2\ndx,\nnC2\n2 jzjn\njzj\n@\u0017\nn\n@y n2x n\n=z>0\n@KC\n1\nwhere \u0017 is the unit normal to @K, pointing into the exterior to K. Note that in both integrals in the r.h.s. above, the\nintegration\np is taken over a curve defined by2 u1=2D 0. Then \u0017 D ru=jruj, and @u=@\u0017 D jruj. On the other hand,\n\u001a0 D\n1 z 2 =z, therefore jruj D j1 z j =jzj.

It is well known (and also follows from section 4) that the resonances of the unit\nsphere S n 1 , n odd, coincide with the zeros of H\u0017(1) (\u0015), \u0017 D l C n=2 1, l D 0, 1, . . ., and each one has multiplicity\nm(l), see (28). By [O2] and (38), they lie in an O(1=\u0017) neighborhood of \u0017@K \\ f=z < 0g and are symmetric to the\n(2)\n(2)\nzeros of H\u0017 (\u0015) about the real axis, see Figure 2. They are the zeros of the polynomial e i\u0015\u0015\u0017 H\u0017 (\u0015) of degree\n\u0017 1=2. More precisely, one can describe those resonances as follows.\nSet\nh3\u0010 \u0019\n\u0011i2=3\nak D\n, k D 1, 2, . . . .\nC k\u0019\n2\n4\n15\n\n\fWe view ak as approximate zeros of Ai( z), and by (34), the actual zeros of Ai( w) stay at distance no greater than\np\nC = ak .

(recall (47)), as approximate resonances. The difference between\n\u0015\u0017k and the zeros h\u0017k of H\u0017(2) can be estimated as follows. We combine asymptotics (34), (35) of Ai, Ai 0 with that of\nH\u0017(2) (38). Then we get\ncos(i\u0017\u001a \u0019=4) C O(1=\u0017j\u001aj) D 0,\n(58)\nwhere \u001a D \u001a(\u0015=\u0017) and ignoring the remainder, we do get solutions \u0015k\u0017 as in (57). To simplify our analysis, we will\nanalyze only the zeros h\u0017k and the approximate ones \u0015k\u0017 in the sector\n\u000f \u0014 arg \u0015 \u0014 \u0019\n\n\u000f,\n\n(59)\n\nwith 0 < \u000f \u001c 1 fixed, and we will estimate roughly the rest of the zeros. This will guarantee, that we work with \u001a\nthat is away from 0 and i\u0019. One can, in principle, work in the whole sector arg \u0015 2 [0, \u0019] and use the fact that either\nthough \u001a is not analytic (and invertible) near 1, the function \u0010 is; and this would probably give a sharp bound on the\nremainder term in Theorem 1.\n\nFigure 2: Resonances of the unit sphere S 2 (with Dirichlet b. c.), corresponding to \u0017 \u0014 30.\n\nFor \u0015 as in (59), \u001a D \u001a(\u0015=\u0017) satisfies j\u001aj \u0015 \u000f 3=2 =C . Since the spacing between distinct \u0015\u0017k is uniformly bounded\nfrom below in (59), by the Rouch\u00e9 theorem we get from the equation cos(i\u0017\u001a(\u0015=\u0017) \u0019=4) C O(1=\u0017) D 0 for h\u0017k D \u0015\nthat j\u0015\u0017k h\u0017k j \u0014 C =\u0017 for those h\u0017k in the sector (59).

As above, it is enough to study the case R0 D 1. Note first that in the notation\nof [Z2], \u0018 there corresponds to i\u001a here, therefore, <\u0018 D =\u001a. The approach in [Z2] is to find approximate \u001a\u0017k in\nLemma 6 there:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0019k log \u0017\n1\n\u0019k\n\u001a\u0017k D i\nC\nC log f\n, k D [\u0017=2], . . . , 1, 0, 1, . . . ,\n(63)\n\u0017\n\u0017\n\u0017\n\u0017\nf (\u001a) D 1 z 2 , and to consider \"approximate resonances\" \u0015\u0016k given as solutions of \u001a(\u0015=\u0017) D \u001a\u0017k . For k < 0,\n\u0015\u0016k lie near \u0017@KC \\ f<z > 0g (at a distance not exceeding O(log \u0017)) similarly to the zeros of h(1)\n\u0017 , and those with\nnegative real parts are symmetric to them. For k > 0, they lie in a logarithmic neighborhood of the positive real axis,\nand again, there is a sequence with negative real parts, symmetric to them. They can be considered as approximate\nzeros of j\u0017 (\u0015). Each of the \u0015\u0016k 's is counted with multiplicity m(l). The counting function of the first type is denoted\nin [Z2] by n (r ), the one related to k > 0 is nC(r ). Then one replaces \u001a\u0017k in (63) by its first term i\u0019k=\u0017 only and\ncounts the resulting \u00150s. The proof of [Z2] shows that this gives the leading term in the asymptotics for the exact\nresonances. On the other hand, the counting function n (r ) for \u001a 1(i\u0019k=\u0017) with k < 0 has the same asymptotics as\nthat of NS n 1 (r ), see (57). Similarly, the counting function n (r ) for \u001a 1(i\u0019k=\u0017) with k > 0 coincides with that of\n\n17\n\n\fthe zeros of j\u0017 (\u0015), counted with multiplicities as can be shown as in (58).

The last restriction is not significant\np\nbecause of the symmetry of the resonances about the imaginary axis. Above, \u0010 0 D \u0010 0 (\u0015=\u0017), and the branch of 1 z 2\nis chosen so that its imaginary part is non-positive for =z \u0015 0.

Therefore, for \u0017 \u001d 1, equation (68)\nmay have solutions only in\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(73)\nf0 \u0014 arg z \u0014 \u000fg [ f\u0019 \u000f \u0014 arg z \u0014 \u0019g [ fdist(z, @KC ) \u0014 \u000fg .\nBy the symmetry of resonances about the imaginary axis, it is enough to study them in <\u0015 \u0015 0 only.\nLet us first focus on the region  \u030b1 D fdist(z, @KC ) \u0014 \u000fg \\ fjz 1j \u0015 \u000fI <z > 0g. Isolating a neighborhood of\nz D 1 allows us to use the asymptotics of Ai since j\u0010j > 1=C . Then (69) is still valid but to get an analogue of (70),\nwe need to use (34), (35) instead of (33). We divide (67) by jl (\u0015=c) and after canceling an elliptic factor, we write it\nin the form\n\u0010\n\u0010 1 \u0011\u0011\np\n\u0019 \u0011\u0010\n0 D i 1 z 2 sin i\u0017\u001a\n1CO\n(74)\n4\n\u0017\n\u0012q\n\u0010 1 \u0011\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0019\n1\n1 z 2 =c 2 C O\ncos i\u0017\u001a\n1CO\n.\n\u0017\n4\n\u0017\n19\n\n\fThis can be written also as\n\np\n\u00101\u0011\n\u0019\u0011\n1 z 2 =c 2\ntan i\u0017\u001a\nCO\nD i p\n.\n4\n\u0017\n1 z2\nFor w 6D  \u0307i, the equation tan z D w has a unique solution z D arctan w in 0 \u0014 <z < \u0019, and by the periodicity of\ntan z, all solutions are given by shifts by k\u0019, k D 0,  \u03071, . . .. For \u0017 \u001d 1, the r.h.s above is at uniformly bounded from\nbelow, at positive distance to  \u0307i for z 2  \u030b1 , therefore we get the equation\np\n\u00101\u0011\n1\n1 z 2 =c 2 k C 1=4\ni\u001a D arctan p\nC\n\u0019 CO 2 .\n\u0017\n\u0017\n\u0017\ni 1 z2\n\u0010\n\nWe think of this as an equation for \u001a, where z D z(\u001a). Since z 2  \u030b1 , we wee that C\u000f 3=2 \u0017 \u0014 k \u0014 \u0019=2 C O(1=\u0017), see\n(60).

As in section 7, they are mapped into z's approximating zeros of H\u0017 (\u0017z), with deviation O(1=\u0017),\n(2)\nand therefore we get conjugate resonances \u0015\u0017k in an O(1) neighborhoods of those zeros of h\u0017 (\u0015) that lie in an O(1)\nneighborhood of \u0017 \u030b1 . The O(1) error would not change the asymptotic of their counting function, therefore we get\n#f\u0015\u0017k I j\u0015\u0017k j < r I \u0017 \u0015 \u00170 g D\n\n1\nA n\n2 S\n\n\u0001\nC O(\u000f 3=2 ) r n (1 C o(1))\n\n1\n\n(75)\n\nbased on the analysis in section 7, where \u00170 > 0 is fixed. The factor 1=2 there is explained by the fact that we work in\n<\u0015 > 0 only.\nWe next study the solutions of (68) in  \u030b2 D f0 \u0014 arg z \u0014 \u000fI jz 1j \u0015 \u000fI jz cj \u0015 \u000fg. Similarly to the analysis\nabove, the reason to remove a neighborhood of z D c is to be ensure that j\u0010c (z)j D j\u0010(z=c)j \u0015 1=C , therefore (71) is\nstill valid. This case is analyzed in a manner similar to that above, we will skip the details. As a result, if c > 1, we\nget zeros in  \u030b2 corresponding to\n\u00101\u0011\nk\u0019\n\u001ac,\u0017k D\n(76)\niCO\n, k \u0015 C\u000f 3=2 \u0017, \u0017 \u0015 \u00170 ,\n\u0017\n\u0017\nand k is an integer, compare with (63).

If c < 1, we have to remove O(\u000f)\u0017 number of k's from (76), and (77) will still be preserved.\nIt remains to estimate the number N1,\u0017 (\u000f) and Nc,\u0017 (\u000f) of zeros of (68) in the discs D(1, \u000f) and D(c, \u000f) that are\nnot covered by  \u030b1 [  \u030b2 .

Plugging this into (79), we get (78) for N1,\u0017 (\u000f). Let c < 1. Then log jjl (\u0017z=c)hl (\u0017z)j D\nO (\u0017\u000f) C O(log \u0017) on jz (1 \u000f)j D 4\u000f, and it is also true for z D 1 \u000f. Thus we get (78) for N1,\u0017 (\u000f) in this case\nas well. In the same way we prove (78) for Nc,\u0017 (\u000f).\nEstimate (78) show that the zeros missed in (75), (77) affect the leading term in the asymptotic of NP (r ) only by\nan O(\u000f) term.
