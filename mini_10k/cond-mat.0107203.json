Such an overlap is predicted by band calculations and would render divalent hexaborides\nto be semi-metallic conductors, whereas they would be insulators if there is\nan X-point gap.

We have since found the same result for CaB6\nand Ca1+\u03b4 B6 . We initially [2] interpreted the gap as characteristic only of the\nsurface region probed by ARPES. Strong motivation to re-interpret the gap as\ncharacteristic of the bulk was provided by a band calculation [3] which includes\na GW self energy and finds for CaB6 an X-point gap of the size we observed.\nBy complementary data from our bulk sensitive x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy (XAS and XES) [4], we have now shown conclusively that\na bulk X-point band gap does indeed exist in these divalent hexaborides. In\nthis paper, we show that this gap is absent in trivalent LaB6 and either absent\nor nearly so in mixed valent SmB6 . This finding demonstrates that the band\nstructure of the hexaborides undergoes a non-trivial change as the valency of\nthe metal atom changes from divalent to trivalent.\nFigures 1 and 2 show grey scale intensity images of energy vs. crystal momentum from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data obtained\nat the Ames/Montana beam line, equipped with a 50mm radius VSW spectrometer, of the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of\nWisconsin. The measurements were done on cleaved single crystal surfaces at\na temperature of 20 K and in a vacuum of \u2248 4.0\u00d710\u221211 Torr, using 22 eV\nphotons. Shown in panel B of Fig. 1 is a band calculation for LaB6 [5]. The\ndata are presented as a function of the momentum value projected onto the\n\u0393-X line of the Brillouin zone. Strictly speaking, the k paths corresponding to\nthe data are arcs in the \u0393-X-M plane, not necessarily close to the \u0393-X line.\nHowever, extensive data sets show that these data are nonetheless representative of the states along the \u0393-X line. We tentatively attribute this to a partial\nloss of perpendicular k-conservation due to the photo-electron lifetime [6].\nThe data for LaB6 bear a strong resemblance to the theory of panel B. We show\nthe comparison in panel A. The band \u03b1 of La 5d character agrees excellently\nwith the data, and the band labeled (\u03b2 \u2032 ) is the theoretical \u03b2 band of B 2p\ncharacter shifted by 0.38 eV. The theoretical X point band overlap is 0.54 eV,\nand therefore we estimate the experimental band overlap to be 0.16 eV.\nIn the SmB6 data of Fig. 2, both the \u03b1-like band and the \u03b2-like band are visible,\nthe latter more strongly than the former. Since the \u03b1-like band is very weak in\nthe raw data (A), we enhance its visibility in panel B by dividing the raw data\nby 11x11-point smoothed data. Relative to LaB6 , the Fermi energy lies nearer\nto the bottom of the \u03b1 conduction band, as expected from the reduced valency\nof the Sm ion compared to the La ion. Another difference of the SmB6 data\nfrom the LaB6 data is the presence of essentially k-independent Sm 5f emission,\nfaintly visible near EF in the data of Fig. 2 and clearly observed in data taken\nwith higher photon energy [7]. In Fig. 2, we show as lines experimental band\ndispersions obtained by following the maxima of the image. The position of the\n\u03b1-like band is especially uncertain near the X point, due to the weak emission\n2\n\n\fstrength. Our best estimate is that the two bands barely touch at the X point,\nbut a gap on the order of 0.1 eV is also possible.\nOur findings here also agree with XES and XAS data [4] and show that there\nare non-trivial changes in the band structure as divalent hexaborides evolve\ntowards trivalent hexaborides. Additionally, an anomalous deviation from Vegard's law exists in the Ca1\u2212x Lax B6 series. Rather than the monotonic increase\nin lattice constant expected from the larger La3+ size, the lattice parameter at\nfirst shrinks to a minimum at \u224810% La doping before increasing again with\nhigher La-doping [8]. As electrons are forced into the conduction band by the\nalloying, the purely single particle contribution to the ground state energy is\nreduced if the material can decrease its conduction band energy by contracting, up to the point where the gap is reduced to zero and overlap begins. It is\ninteresting to speculate that the critical La concentration in this system corresponds to the band crossover. We note a tendency in both LaB6 and SmB6\nfor the overlap to \"stick\" near zero as the chemical potential continues to rise\nin the conduction band.\nThis work was supported at University of Michigan by the US DOE under\nContract No. DE-FG-02-90ER45416 and by the US NSF under Grant No.\nDMR-99-71611.
