The analysis is extended\nto the case of non-ballistic transport in NS point contacts with exotic superconductors,\nmolybdenum carbide Mo-C and oxypnictide La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs from a group of iron-based\nsuperconductors.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nStudies of the physical phenomena underlying the process of percolation flow of\ncharge through the interfaces of conductive heterosystems are always relevant, because the\nindividual characteristics of the interfaces such as both quality and geometry, distinguished\nby diversity, initiate the consideration of various scenarios of electron scattering at the interfaces. This is especially true of the interfaces formed by the contacts of normal metals (N) including magnetic ones (F), with superconductors (S). At present, the investigations of scattering\nmechanisms in these interfaces are also stimulated by the emergence of new superconductors based on multicomponent systems with complex mechanisms of electron correlation [1].\nSingle charge transfer through the obstacles between the metals in the form of interfaces,\novercome by tunnelling, is not only impeded because of the potential barriers, but also, in the\ncase where one of the metals is a superconductor, is generally prohibited due to the absence\nof free states in the latter for the quasiparticles with energy less than the superconducting\nenergy gap (\u2206). The laws of conservation, however, eliminate this prohibition generating\na hole excitation (h) in N - metal in the direction opposite to that of the velocity of the\n1\n\n\felectron (e), incident on the interface from the N - metal side. The hole has the same energy\nand momentum as those of the incident electron, but opposite spin direction. The process is\nknown as Andreev retroreflection [2]. (Spin orientation of the quasiparticles in the Andreev e-h\nhybrid which corresponds to a singlet state, is particularly significant for FS systems, since\nthe magnetic metals, unlike non-magnetic ones, do not possess symmetry with respect to spin\nrotation.) Due to this fact, another electron at the N side is involved in the process of charge\ntransfer through the interface, so that a part of quasiparticle current is allowed to be directly\nconverted into a supercurrent - the current of Cooper pairs on the side of a superconductor.\nIt follows that at the transition of one of the metals of a bimetallic system from the normal\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\nZ = 0\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n3\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n5\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n2\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nNN\n\n/G\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\nNS\n\nNN\n\n/G\n\nNS\n\nG\n\n1.6\n\n4\n\n1.4\n\n(dI/dU)\n\n1.6\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nU, ( /e)\n\nFigure 1: Normalized generalized conductance of non-ballistic NS contacts with a barrier-free\nN\nN\ninterface (z = 0) calculated by Eq.

(8) and (10)]. T = 0.\nto superconducting state, this quantum effect can be identified by a change (decrease) in the\nvoltage U when measured in constant-current regime, or by a change (increase) in the current\nI in constant-voltage regime, if the system has conductance of a finite value. In the limit of\nN\nNS bisystem consisting of nondissipative metals with the mean free path of electrons lel\n\u2192\u221e\n(the BTK model [3]), the role of this conductance will be played by the only conductance in\nthe system - that of the interface, Gif . It will, therefore, concentrate all the voltage U applied\nto the system, so that Gif = I/U (such a quantity we call the generalized conductance, in\ncontrast to the differential one, G\u2032 (U) = dI/dU). In this limiting case, the role of Andreev\nreflection is reduced to a twofold change in Gif at the NN \u21c6 NS transitions of the system. At\nenergies eU; kB T < \u2206 (T is the temperature), such change will manifest itself in the form of\na maximum in conductance curves (see curve 3 in Fig. 1) if there are no additional sources\nof scattering at the interface (ie, in case of barrier-free interface, z = 0, in the terminology of\nN\nRef. [3]). Note that in the ballistic approximation, lel\n\u2192 \u221e, the generalized and differential\nconductances of a barrier-free interface are qualitatively of the same shape (compare curves 3\nand 4 in Fig. 1).\nIn the ballistic transport regime, another form of G(U) curves is also possible when\neU; kB T < \u2206, namely, the shape of the curve with a dip corresponding to a decrease in\nthe interface conductance with decreasing the transparency of the interface due to existence\nof a barrier of finite height, z 6= 0, which reduces the probability of Andreev reflection. Thus,\nin the ballistic transport model, the only possible shapes of the normalized curves G(U)/GNN\n2\n\n\f(here, GNN is the generalized conductance in the NN state of the system) in the energy range\neU < \u2206, similar to the form of G\u2032 (U)/GNN curves in the same interval, are those with a\nmaximum (Gif (NS) RNN = 2, z = 0) or with a dip (0 < Gif (NS) RNN < 2; z 6= 0) [3].\nHowever, as will be seen later, the aforementioned shape of the curves G(U)/GNN with a\ndip is not a prerogative of the ballistic model, as is often assumed. The observation of curves\nof the similar shape in special circumstances, which do not produce any justification for using\nballistic conception, indicates the same. The measurement of current-voltage characteristics of\nthe samples with a point-contact geometry (point contacts) must be considered as such special conditions. With high probability we can assume that in the majority of point contacts,\nprepared in different ways, the ballistic transport conditions are not realized. In this connection, the real curves of point-contact normalized conductance, although visually resembling the\ncurves for the interface conductance in the ballistic model, can have completely different nature\nand lead to conclusions radically different from those based on the ballistic analysis.\n\nFigure 2: Schematic view of measurements of point-contact electrical characteristics.\n\n2\n\nNon-ballistic NS point contact\n\nThe identification of the experimental G(U) curves with the curves of the same shape in the\nballistic NS model means automatically that the voltage measured across a real contact is taken\nentirely related to the NS interface and the interface is considered the only possible source of\nresistance in the system. In the absence of scattering centers for electrons, the resistance of\nthe interface, Rif , is non-zero due to the effect of \"bottleneck\" for incompressible media, thus\ndepending only on the cross section of the interface A \u223c d2 (here, d is the transverse size of\nthe interface). Yu Sharvin was the first to attract attention to this fact [4]:\nRif = (Gif )\u22121 = (pF /e2 n)/d2 \u2261 3[2N(0)e2 vF ]\u22121 /A.\n\n(1)\n\nHere, e, pF , vF , n, and N(0) are the charge, the Fermi momentum and velocity, the concentration and density of states of free electrons per spin, respectively.\nFor N metals Cu, Al, Au, and Ag commonly used in the contacts we have\nRif \u2248 5 * 10\u221211 /A [Ohm],\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fif A is expressed in cm2 . Eq. (2) is a criterion for using ballistic approximation while considering\na mode of transport in real point contacts.\nAs noted above, both geometrical and physical conditions of measurement of the contact\nconductance in real experiments cannot meet those of ballistic transport regime. Indeed, a\ntypical longitudinal size of the contacts, Lc , defined by the distance between measuring (potential) probes, is of the order of 10 \u03bcm or more. This is due to the fact that the geometry\nof point contacts does not allow one to measure the interface region by a standard four-probe\ntechnique, since it appears to be either three-contact, including significant resistance of a probe\n(usually), or practically two-contact, as is shown in Fig. 2. Because of this, the potential lines,\nwhich determine the voltage measured across the probes, in fact, are always on both sides of\nthe interface. They are moved into the depth of both N and S layers at distances comparable\nN\nto or larger than lel\n. As a result, the actual size of the contact is at least an order of magnitude greater than the thickness of the interface (for example, the thickness of oxide layers,\nt \u2248 10 \u00f7 100 \u00c5 [5]).\nIn addition, noting that\n(\u03c1lel )N = 3/2N(0)e2 vF = Rif A\n\n(3)\n\n(\u03c1 is the resistivity), we find that the condition (Rc /Rif ) \u2265 1, under which we cannot assume\nN\nthat the voltage is applied only to the interface, is achieved at Lc \u2265 lel\nfor any area of the\ninterface, as this area and N - side cross section are the same, at least within the limits of the\nN\ndistance from the interface of the order of lel\n. Hence, an important conclusion follows: The\nvalue of the contact resistance which, on the contrary, depends on the cross section, cannot be\na criterion for the ballistic nature of transport in the contact.\nWe illustrate this with two examples. Typical magnitude of the resistivity \u03c1 of copper or\ngold wires, \u223c 0.1 mm in diameter, which are mostly used as N - side material (probe) in NS\ncontacts, at helium temperatures amounts to \u03c1 \u2248 10\u22127 Ohm * cm, which value, according to\nN\nEqs. (2) and (3), should correspond to the mean free path lel\n\u223c 1 \u03bcm. This is no less than an\norder of magnitude shorter than the above estimated Lc , that is inconsistent with the ballistic\nconsideration. At the same time, when the contact area A is equal to the cross section of the\nwire of the specified diameter, the measurement will show the total contact resistance RLc of\norder of 3 \u00f7 10 \u03bcOhm.\nOn the contrary, when using the N probe with a working tip size d \u223c 10 \u00f7 100 \u00c5, which\nN\nvalue is much less than l0 \u2248 0.02 mm (l0 is the mean free path in the absence of size effect), lel\nis approximately equal to d (\u226a l0 ) and \u03c1 \u223c \u03c10 (l0 /d) ln\u22121 (l0 /d) [6]. In this case, the condition\n(Rc /Rif ) \u2265 1 which reflects the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport will be satisfied\nin contacts with the resistances of the order of 10 Ohm or greater at the same liquid-helium\ntemperatures. Clearly, in high-resistance contacts with the resistance of about 100 Ohm it is\nunacceptable to estimate the interface area (or the size of the probe tip) in accordance with\nEq. (3), as is often done, since, under d \u226a l0 , Eq. (3) underestimates the size of contact area\nby a factor of \u03c1/\u03c10 (by several orders of magnitude), thereby creating the illusion of ballistic\nN\ntransport. Thus, the condition Lc \u2265 lel\n, inconsistent with the ballistic approximation, appears\nto be satisfied in most real point contacts regardless of their total resistance. This means that\nin real contacts, potential bias is distributed along the whole length of the contact rather than\nconcentrating at the interface, as required by the ballistic model.\nConsider the metal contact in the absence of oxide layers and additional scattering potentials at the interface (z = 0). In accordance with the additivity rule of resistances (Matthiessen's\n\u22121 \u22121\nrule), generalized contact conductance G\u03a3 can be expressed as G\u03a3 = [G\u22121\nwhere GN\nif + GN ]\nis the conductance of the normal region before the interface with cross section A and Gif =\n(Rt )\u22121 is the conductance of the barrier-free interface. We write the expressions for the current\non the N side in the NN and NS states of the interface. Since, as noted above, Lc \u226b t, then Lc actually coincides with the length of the normal part of the contact, LN , and in the NN flowing\n4\n\n\fregime the current can be written as\nINN = jA = \u03c3\u03a3(NN) EA = \u03c3\u03a3(NN) (U/LN )A =\nLN\nLN\n\u22121\n= (2/3)N(0)evF (1 + N )\u22121 A(eU) = Rif\n(1 + N )\u22121 U,\nlel\nlel\n\n(4)\n\nwhere in addition to Eqs.

Taking into account that GN(NS) = Rif\nlel (A)/LN , where\nN\nlel\n(A) is the mean free path of electrons in a dissipative normal region, which may depend on\nthe probability of Andreev reflection (see below), we get Eq.

Apparently, this is observed in the majority of point-contact current-voltage\ncharacteristics (see, eg, Refs. [7 - 9]). Dividing Eq. (7) by Eq.

Under these conditions,\nthe elastic scattering at the same impurity of the electron and coherently conjugated Andreev\nhole leads to a twofold increase in the effective scattering cross section, \u0398, at that impurity [10],\nin particular, to a double decrease in the conductance GN(NS) of the next-to-interface N layer as\nN\na whole, lel\nin thickness [11 - 13]. Accordingly, the dependence of mean free path of electrons\non the N side of the NS interface on the probability of Andreev reflection can be expressed as\nfollows [10]:\nN\n\u22121\n[lel\n(A)]NS = (\u03b1\u0398NS )\u22121 = [\u03b1\u0398N (1 + \u03b3A)]\u22121 = LN\nel [(1 + \u03b3A)]\n5\n\n\fN\n(\u03b3 \u221d lel\n/LN in order of magnitude [11]).

The\nN\ndependencies were calculated numerically by Eq. (8) for two values of the ratio LN /lel\n, 1 (curve\n1 ) and 2 (curve 2 ), in the approximation T = 0. Also shown are the same conductance obtained by calculation in the ballistic approximation (curve 3 ) and the corresponding differential\nconductance (curve 4 ). When calculating Eq. (8), the function A(eU) which depends on the\nratio of coherent factors from the Bogolyubov equations, was taken from Ref. [3].\nComparison of the curves 1 - 3 presented in the Figure for the generalized normalized\nconductance GNS (U)/GNN shows at least two major differences between ballistic (curve 3 ) and\nnon-ballistic (curves 1, 2 ) contacts. First, the value of U at which the behavior of non-ballistic\nconductance at the NN \u21c4 NS transitions of the system changes radically, depends on the ratio\nN\nLN /lel\n. Second, the asymptotics of GNS (U)/GNN are of the opposite nature, both in eU < \u2206\nand in eU > \u2206 regions. Usually, they analyze the differential conductance, as more expressive,\nrather than the generalized one. In Fig. 1, curve 5, we show the behavior of the normalized\ndifferential conductance of the non-ballistic contact\n(dI/dU)\nd(GNS (U)/GNN ) GNS (U)\n=U\n+\nGN N\ndU\nGNN\n\n(10)\n\nN\nfor the same ratio LN /lel\n= 1 that corresponds to the generalized conductance depicted by\ncurve 1. It is seen that the main features of the asymptotic behavior in both cases are common.\nThus, the asymptotic behavior of the conductance of non-ballistic contacts appears formally\nsimilar to the behavior of G\u2032if of a ballistic contact with the barriers z 6= 0 at the interface\n(see Ref. [3]), which fact is apparently the reason for the application of a ballistic model (often\nunjustified) while analyzing the curves G(U). Since in this case details of the curves assume a\nmeaning which does not correspond to reality, it can easily lead to wrong conclusions.\nSpecial note is expedient to make in regard to non-ballistic tunnel junctions of hold-down\ntype, with the oxide interface undestroyed, which have semiconductor conductivity as a rule.\nThe resistance of these interfaces can be the greatest in the contact, even in the NN state.\nIn this case, in this state, all the bias voltage will drop at the interface, as a ballistic model\nassumes. However, since the thickness of the oxide layers t is so small that t \u226a \u03beN (see above),\nthen, at the transition from the NN to NS state, due to the proximity effect, the resistance of the\noxide layer vanishes, having experienced the superconducting transition in the parameter eU.\nAs a result, a part of the curve of the generalized conductance GNS (U)/GNN in some interval of\neU close to \u2206 at first takes the shape similar to that of the curves 3 or 4 in Fig. 1. However, at\neU < \u2206, the potentials will be redistributed, thus transforming transport to the regime where\nthe conductance behaves in accordance with Eq. (8). In high-resistance contacts, the scale of\nthis part of the curve is usually small against that part of the incomparably larger scale, which\nis associated with the manifestation of the above proximity effect, so that the overall shape\n\n6\n\n\f1.02\n\n1.01\n\n4.2 K\n\n1.00\n\nR/R\n\n0.99\nCu/Mo-C\n\n0.98\n\nMo\nCu/Mo\n\n0.97\n\n0.96\n\n0.95\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nT, K\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nFigure 3: Temperature dependencies of resistance for: NS point contact Cu/Mo-C without\noxide layer - ; NN point contact Cu/Mo - N; non-carbonized Mo - \u0004.\n\nof the curve may easily be taken for a behavior of the ballistic conductance to which it has\nnothing to do.\nIn this paper, we investigate the behavior of the conductance of non-ballistic point-contact\nhybrid NS systems with unconventional superconductors, Cu (N) / molybdenum carbide Mo-C\n(S) and Cu (N) / oxypnictide La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs (S), x \u2248 0.15, in the Andreev reflection mode.\n\nT NS\n(\n\n=2.2 K\n\nCu/Mo-C\n\n)\n\n0.8\n\neU\n\n0.6\n\n/\n\n=1\n\n0.4\n\n(\n\n/\n\n) /\n\ndI dU G\n\n(NN)\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nUm\n,\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nV\n\nFigure 4: Dependence of the normalized differential conductance of a non-ballistic NS point\ncontact Cu/Mo-C with the oxide layer destroyed on the bias voltage across the contact.

T =\n2.25 K.\n\n(this includes regulating resistances) was always greater than the resistance of the contacts.\nWe specifically stipulate that as, while studying high-resistance tunnel NS contacts with semiconducting properties (eg, about 100 Ohm and above), at NN \u21c4 NS transitions, in addition\nto those features mentioned earlier, the probability of switching preset regimes is not excluded\nyet, when using a current source with rather low resistance. This can also distort the meaning\nof the results obtained.\nContacts were made in two ways - by the spark erosion method and mechanically. Contacts made by the first method (Cu/molybdenum carbide Mo-C) have low resistance since the\ntip touches directly with the superconductor burning the oxide barrier; besides, the area of\nmelted tip in this case was considerable. Contacts made by the second method (Cu/Mo-C\nand Cu/La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs) have higher resistance due to conservation of the oxide layer. The\ndifference in resistance between low-resistivity contacts and high-resistivity ones were within\ntwo - five orders of magnitude (from 10\u22125 Ohm to 1 Ohm). The G(U) curves for low-resistance\ncontacts were studied using a pi\u0441ovoltmeter [14], for high-resistance ones - with the help of a\nstandard measuring technique. Since superconducting carbide layer in Cu/Mo-C samples could\nbe completely destroyed at the point of contact during preparing them by the spark erosion\nmethod, we tested the possibility of maintenance of the NS regime in the process of measuring IVC by controlling the type of the temperature dependence of the contact resistance. In\nthis study, we investigated the contacts prepared on the same samples of molybdenum with\ncarbonized surface layer that were described in Ref. [15]. Contacts Cu/La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs were\nprepared only by hold-down method. In the NN state, they revealed semiconducting behavior,\nas well as hold-down contacts Cu/Mo-C.\n\nNS contacts Cu (N) / Mo-C (S)\nTypical temperature dependencies of the normalized resistance are shown in Fig. 3 for the\ncontact with an undefeated layer of superconducting molybdenum carbide at the interface\nCu/Mo-C (circles) and for the contact with a destroyed superconducting layer, ie, Cu/Mo\n(triangles). Squares depict the resistance of non-carbonized parts of molybdenum measured\nby a standard four-probe technique. The measured resistance values were normalized to the\ncorresponding contact resistance at 4.2 K. In particular, for a low-resistance contact (the curve\n8\n\n\fwith circles), it amounts to R(4.2K) = 1.43935 * 10\u22125 Ohm. The dependence of resistance\non temperature of this kind, which contains a singularity of the superconducting transition\ntype, indicated the possibility of realizing the transitions NN \u21c4 NS at the contact interface by\nchanging the bias voltage U to a value corresponding to an electron energy of the order of kB Tc .\nIn our samples of molybdenum carbide, Tc is approximately 2.7 K [15]. Only the conductance\n\nFigure 6: Dependence of the normalized differential conductance of a non-ballistic hold-down\nNS point contact Cu/Mo-C with an undefeated oxide layer on the bias voltage across the\ncontact. T = 2.1 K.\nof the contacts which revealed such temperature dependence showed features associated with\nthe above transitions in the parameter eU. Thus, at the transition to the Andreev reflection\nregime (NN \u2192 NS), when eU/\u2206 < 1, the conductance of such contacts always reduced rather\nthan increased, as it could be in the ballistic regime of current flow (see Fig. 1).\nIn Figs. 4 and 5, the examples are shown of the behavior of the derivatives of generalized conductance of the investigated contacts with a burned oxide layer, but an undestroyed\nsuperconducting carbide Mo-C layer, in the range of bias voltage values eU of the order of\n\u2206 = 1.73kB Tc \u2248 0.47 mV. Based on the analysis from the previous section, one can assume\nthat the measured curves describe the behavior of the conductance of a non-ballistic contact\nN\nwith a ratio LN /lel\nof about 1 (Fig. 4) or slightly higher (Fig. 5). When the diameter of the\ninterface (probe tip diameter) is about 10 \u03bcm, an estimation gives the values of the mean free\npath of electrons in the normal contact area and the size of that area of the order of 0.1 \u03bcm.\nFigure 6 for a contact Cu/Mo-C and Figure 7 for contacts Cu/La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs can serve\nas an illustration of the remark made in the previous section concerning the influence of the\nproximity effect on the shape of the conductance curves for high-resistance hold-down contacts\nwith an undestroyed oxide interface. (We will discuss the latter Figure in more detail below.)\nIn these (always high-resistive) contacts, resistance ratio Rc (4.2 K)/Rc (300 K) exceeds 1 which\nfact indicates the presence of an oxide layer with non-metallic conductivity at the interface. If\nT < Tc , the contribution from this layer to the contact resistance due to the proximity effect\nshould be absent, as noted earlier, until the electron energy eU is less than \u2206. In this energy\nrange, the probability of Andreev reflection is close to unity and its contribution to the contact\nresistance is maximum (see a minimum in the curves near U = 0 in Figs. 6 and 7), since in\nthat range, the mechanism of doubling cross section for scattering of coherent quasiparticles\nby impurities is responsible for the decrease in conductance. As the energy eU increases, this\nresistive contribution, according to Eqs. (9) or (10) (see curves 1 and 5 in Fig. 1), will continue\nto decrease (increasing conductance) until the order parameter at the interface is suppressed\n9\n\n\f(suppressed proximity effect) and the contribution from a resistive oxide layer becomes to\nappear, up to the full suppression at eU > \u2206. Note that an indistinguishable contribution\nfrom the boundary resistance on the S side of the contact is not excluded; that contribution is\nassociated with the charge unbalance of the quasiparticles due to the dispersion of the order\nparameter at the NS interface, which behaves similarly [16]. In Fig. 6, corresponded to this are\nthose branches of the conductance curve that fall to a value close to unity, with increasing eU.\nIn general, one could conclude that the size Lc of non-ballistic contacts with the resistance\nof no more than 1 Ohm, prepared according to techniques used by us, is of the order of 0.1 \u03bcm\nN\nfor (Lc /lel\n) \u2248 1 \u00f7 2.

Experimental investigations of the conductance of point-contact NS heterosystems, with oxypnictides\nas a superconductor, under conditions of Andreev reflection, seem to be an important trend in\nthe study of this problem. The Andreev reflection is known to lead, in the absence of magnetic\nfields, to initiation of coherent quasiparticles, e and h, on N side which are related through\nthat reflection at the NS interface. Their coherent scattering by impurities leads, as noted, to\na significant decrease in the conductance of non-ballistic NS systems due to doubling scattering cross section. Thus, the behavior of the conductance of NS systems, in particular, with\nchanging the electron energy eU, allows one, above all, to ascertain whether the conductance\nof the system is of Andreev type and, therefore, to understand, whether the intrinsic magnetism of oxypnictides plays any role in the manifestation of the effects associated with the\nsuperconducting properties.\nFigure 7 confirms the existence of the superconducting transition in the temperature dependence of resistance of two oxypnictide samples we used to prepare NS point contacts, the\nconductance of which was then investigated in the regime of Andreev reflection at T \u226a Tc .\nTemperature dependence of the resistance of one of the samples was measured by two-probe\n10\n\n\ftechnique (curve 1 ) and of the second (curve 2 ) - by four-probe technique. Indeed, a superconducting feature occurred in the curves R(T) at 26.6 K, as was also observed for oxypnictides\nLa[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs with x \u2248 0.15 [1]. We prepared point contacts on these samples by exerting\npressure without puncturing the oxide layer, as evidenced by a significant contact resistance\nunder normal current flow (about 10 Ohm at T > Tc ) and the ratio Rc (78 K)/Rc (300 K) > 1.\n\n1.00\n\nT\n\n(NN)\n\nG\n/\n\nx\n\n0.96\n0.94\n0\n\n0.92\n\n3T\n0.90\n\n6T\n\n/\n\ndI dU\n\nxFx]FeAs\n\n1-\n\n~0.1\n\n)\n\n(NS)\n\nLa[O\n\n=4.2 K\n\n0.98\n\n9T\n\n(\n\n0.88\n\n12T\n0.86\n0.84\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\nUm\n,\n\n50\n\n100\n\nV\n\nFigure 8: Dependence of the normalized differential conductance of a non-ballistic NS point\ncontact Cu (N)/La[O0.85 F\u22480.1]FeAs (S) with an undefeated oxide layer on the bias voltage across\nthe contact in various magnetic fields.\nTypical behavior of the conductance of such contacts as a function of bias voltage across the\ncontact is shown in Fig. 8 over a wide range of magnetic fields, B. We see that the feature that\ncan be called a \"gap feature\" is observed only in the conductance curve measured in the absence\nof an external magnetic field. This means that the intrinsic magnetism of oxypnictides at B = 0\ndoes not prevent either the appearance of superconductivity or other effects associated with it,\nin particular, such as Andreev reflection. This is proved, firstly, by the shape of the feature\nin the curve for B = 0, which just corresponds to a decrease in conductance with decreasing\nenergy eU, as it should be in the NS regime of non-ballistic contacts when the cross section for\nthe impurity scattering of coherent quasiparticles, coupled by Andreev reflection, is doubled.\nAnd, secondly, by the low values of the energy eU compared with \u2206, for which the effect exists,\nthat is the values insufficient for suppressing the proximity effect at the interface, and thus, for\nthe manifestation of a non-zero contribution from the boundary resistance, in particular, the\nresistive contribution from the oxide layer. Since under conditions of non-ballistic transport\nin the contact, a bias voltage is distributed between the interface and N side of the contact,\nN\na position of a gap feature, as shown in Section 2, depends on the ratio LN /lel\n(see Fig. 1).\nFrom the shape of the curve shown in Fig. 9, which is a part of the curve B = 0 in Fig. 8 in\nan enlarged energy scale, it follows that the value of the gap BCS energy of the oxypnictide,\n\u2206 = 1.73kB Tc \u2248 2.5 mV, at the interface is reached at eU \u2248 3\u2206 at the contact. Evaluation\nby Eqs. (8) and (9) shows that the depth of the minimum in the curve at eU \u2192 0 must be\nGNS /GNN \u2248 4/4.1 \u2248 0.95 (GNN = GNN (N)(eU = 3\u2206)), which value, as we see, corresponds to\nthe measured one. The normalized conductance curves of point-contact NS systems (including\nthose with an oxypnictide as a superconductor) studied in Ref. [16] can also serve as a good\nillustration of the discussed features of non-ballistic contact conductance.\nThe absence of the above effect in external magnetic fields emphasizes, in addition, that this\neffect is a feature of \"Andreev\" conductance in conditions of coherence of e and h quasiparticles\nwhich takes place only in a zero magnetic field. In a nonzero magnetic field, the coherence of the\n11\n\n\fquasiparticles is disturbed due to spatial divergence of their trajectories after Andreev reflection\nat NS boundary [18]. As can be seen from Fig. 9, when the bias voltage eU exceeds the energy\nvalue 3\u2206, a non-zero \"boundary resistance\" (the resistance of the oxide layer) appears which\nwas suppressed before by the proximity effect and is influenced by a magnetic field. We omit\nthe detailed discussion of this branch of the curves as not relevant to the merit. However,\nthe impression is that the variation of its shape upon increasing the field is associated with a\ndecrease in carrier mobility in a semiconductor material. The dependence of this part of the\ncontact resistance on the magnetic field is shown in Fig. 10, in which \u2206G\u2217 /G(eU = 3\u2206) =\n[G(eU = 100 mV) \u2212 G(eU = 3\u2206)]/G(eU = 3\u2206).

In this connection, one can\nassume that the mechanisms for magnetic interaction, such as ferromagnetic fluctuations, and\nthe mechanism for superconducting pairing of charge carriers (as the results convince, BCS-like)\ndo not overlap in energy in the layered compound La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs with a 10 % replacement\nof oxygen by fluorine. It is apparently achieved by a corresponding fragmentation of the Fermi\nsurface of conduction electrons (nesting), which eliminates the competition of these mechanisms\nat the antiferromagnetic long-range order [19, 20]. The suppression of superconductivity and\nits attendant effects is observed only in external magnetic fields (in our experiments, at B \u2265 3\nT).\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we consider the behavior of the conductance of point-contact non-ballistic NS\nheterosystems depending on the electron energy eU specified by the bias voltage U across the\ncontact. It is noted that G(U) curves for non-ballistic and ballistic contacts, having a completely\ndifferent nature, may, however, coincide in shape, which fact, apparently, is the reason for using,\noften unjustified, a ballistic model to analyze those curves for real contacts, which are, in fact,\nnon-ballistic.

The\nhigher is the probability of Andreev reflection, the greater is that contribution, the greatest at\nthe zero-height barrier at the interface (z = 0, A = 1). The same shape of the conductance\ncurve can be obtained in the ballistic model by fitting the height of the barrier at the interface,\nthus, by suppressing accordingly the probability of Andreev reflection. Criteria allowing one to\ndifferentiate between the regimes of ballistic and non-ballistic transport are given, at apparent\nsimilarity of the corresponding conductance curves. One of the major indications of the nonballistic nature of transport in a contact is the excess of the bias voltage, applied to the contact,\nabove the voltage corresponding to the energy gap of the used superconductor at which NN\n\u21c4 NS transition is realized. It manifests itself in the form of peculiarities (kinks) in the\nconductance curves G(U). The analysis is extended to the case of non-ballistic transport in\nNS point contacts with exotic superconductors, namely, molybdenum carbide, Mo-C, and ironbased oxypnictide, La[O1\u2212x Fx ]FeAs. The experiment shows that the conductance behavior of\nthe real point contacts of any nature is almost always match that expected for non-ballistic\ntransport regime.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y.
