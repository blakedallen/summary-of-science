Nevertheless, it applies to many other\nsituations. For instance, in reference [6] was conjectured that Neanderthal\nextinction in Europe was consequence of Gause's principle. In a formal point\nof view, it states that two competing species cannot coexist in the same ecological niche. In this framework, it is assumed that the strong species fulls\ncompletely the niche and the weak disappears (exclusion). We remark that\nthis principle is limited in the sense that it applies when re-adaptation, migration, or genetic changes does not exist. This principle seems very intuitive\nin natural environment or for species in laboratories; but what is the situation with genetically prepared sterile populations ?. To be more explicit,\nconsider the well known problem related to extermination of native fruit flies\nby genetically sterilized fruit flies [7,8]. The two species exist in the same\necological niche when the sterile population is released. Before the interaction, we assume that the native species fulls the niche in a stable way. In\nsome geographic regions and for optimal initial conditions, native fruit flies\ncan be exterminated by the sterile population. Namely, in this case both\nspecies disappears and the principle must be reformulated as\n\nPrinciple of Gause : Two competing species cannot coexist in the same\necological niche and at least one of the species disappear.\nNamely, it contains explicitly the possibility of total extinction (both\nspecies). This formulation of the principle includes all strategy of extermination with genetically altered species [7,8].\n\nIn this paper we consider a mathematical non linear model of competition\nbetween a native species with number of individuals N(t), and other sterile\n2\n\n\fwith number of individuals given by M(t). Explicitly, we are interested on\nthe mathematical conditions for total extinction in the ecological niche. The\nstructure of the article is the follows: first we present a predator-predator\nnon linear model for the variable N and M (equations 1-3), and its stability\nanalysis. Numerical simulation confirms the stability analysis and the existence of a threshold Mc where total extinction exist. We give an analytical\nestimation of this threshold value (equation (5)). Near to the critical value,\nthe behavior of the extinction time \u03c4ext is studied. This extinction time is,\nafter our numerical calculation, related to an critical exponent \u03bd (equation\n(6)). Finally, the case including diffusion is considered, here we found the\nexistence of a critical size territory Lc were total extinction holds (for any\ninitial condition of the species M). Some possible generalizations are stressed\nat the end of the paper.\n\nTo be explicit, consider the Lotka-Volterra type evolution equations with\ninteraction\ndM\n= \u2212\u03b1\u2032 M \u2212 \u03b4NM,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\ndN\n= NF (N) \u2212 \u03b4NM,\n(2)\ndt\nwhere \u03b1\u2032 is the death-rate of the sterile population, \u03b4 is the interaction parameter, and the function F (N) describes the population growing of the native\nspecies when interaction does not exist. For instance, when F (N) = \u03b1 \u2212 N\n(\u03b1 is a constant) we obtain the usual Verlhust, or logistic, equation. Remark\nthat the stability of the point (N = 0, M = 0) depends of the sign of F (0).\nIn fact, when F (0) < 0 this point becomes stable and the possibility of total\nextinction exists in accordance with the Gause's principle. Moreover, this\ncondition of stability of (0, 0) seems reasonable if we think that species needs\na minimal social structure, or genetical diversity, to survival (i.e. a minimal\n3\n\n\fnumber of individuals). We stress that the dynamical systems (1-3) is irreversible, for instance, a Lyapounov function L associated to the systems is\njust L = M(t).\n\nTo carry-out explicit our calculations we consider the model where\nF (N) = (\u03b1 \u2212 N)(N \u2212 \u03b2),\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03b1 and \u03b2 positives parameters (\u03b1 < \u03b2). Since F (0) < 0, the point\n(N = 0, M = 0) is stable and total extinction would be expected. The linear\nanalysis of (1-3) shows that the point (N = \u03b1, M = 0) is unstable (saddle)\nand (N = \u03b2, M = 0) is a stable focus. Figure 1 shows the stability diagram\nfor our equations. So, the sterile population M disappears and, depending\non the initial conditions, total extinction would exist in the niche. Namely,\nthe systems has two atractors, the first (0,0) related to total extinction and\nthe other (\u03b2, 0) related to survival of species N.\n\nFigure 1: A sketch of the critical points associated with equations (1-2)\n\n4\n\n\fThe explicit question which we are concerned in this paper is the follows:\nif initially the native species number is N = \u03b2 (the stable point without\ninteraction) then, after released Mo sterile individuals, when have we total\nextinction?. Namely, before the interaction, the native species is in the niche\nin a stable way. After, Mo sterile individuals are released and the interaction\nprocess produces a competitive struggle. Here we ask about the minimal\npopulation Mo of sterile individuals producing total extinction in the niche.\nIn fact, if the sterile population is not enough then they death and total\nextermination do not occur.\n\nNumerical calculations confirm the existence of a critical value Mc and\nwhen Mo > Mc total extinction exist in the niche. Figure 2 shows the time\nbehaviors of N(t) for different initial value Mo , of the sterile species released\nin the niche. There is a critical value for the initial condition Mo related to\ntotal extinction. A criterion for total extinction is depending on the initial\nnumber of sterile population Mo and given by\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)2\n.\n(4)\n4\u03b4\nThis criterion is established as follows: from (1) and (3), we have that M(t) =\nR\nexp (\u2212\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b4 < N >t ) t, where < N >t = (1/t) t N(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 . When t \u2192 \u221e,\nand assuming total extinction, we expect an exponential decaying behavior\nfor M. So, an important fraction of the decaying process, assumed slow,\nis reached when M \u223c Mo e\u22121 . If now we stressed that not other stationary\npoint (excepting (0, 0) exist in (2), we obtain the criterion (4). We have used\nthe maximum value of the function F (N) given by (3). We remark that\nthis is a coarse criterion, nevertheless, it works in accord with our numerical\nsimulations. For instance, the figure 2 describes extinction when M0 > 270\nMo > 2.7\n\n5\n\n\fin accordance with (4). This is true also for other parameter values.\n\nFigure 2: A numerical simulations of equations (1-3)\nThe criteria (4) can be generalized easily to a system with arbitrary distribution F (N) in (1-2). Namely, by imposing the inequality Fmax < \u03b4Mo e\u22121\n(with e \u223c 2, 7).\n\nThe figure 3 shows a simulation of the final native population N(t = \u221e)\nfor different initial condition Mo of the sterile population. Clearly there is\na critical value Mc which separates the survival and extermination regime.\nFrom equation (4), a first approximation for this critical values is\nMc \u223c 2.7\n\n(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)2\n.\n4\u03b4\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n\fFigure 3: The final distribution of native population M\nMoreover, figure 2 suggests that near to this critical value the extinction\ntime \u03c4ext depends on (Mo \u2212 Mc ). This is so because when Mo \u2192 Mc+ the\nextinction time must be infinity. Explicitly we expect a behavior like\n\u03c4ext \u223c\n\n1\n; Mo > Mc ,\n(Mo \u2212 Mc )\u03bd\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bd is a unknown parameter. The evaluation of this critical exponent\nrequires a computational work beyond of the scope of this paper. It will be\ndo elsewhere. The conjecture (6) is reinforced by numerical calculation. In\nfact, using the same parameter values that in figure 2, and the definition\n1\nlim Ln(N(t)/\u03b2),\n(7)\nt t\u2192\u221e\nwe see that the existence of the critical exponent \u03bd is confirmed numerically\n(figure 4).\n\u22121\n\u03c4ext\n=\u2212\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: The extinction time \u03c4ext\nNow we discuss briefly the incorporation of migration to the set of evolution equations (1-2). In fact, total extermination could be also carried out by\ndiffusion process. In some cases unstable points become stable by diffusion\nin limited territories. Thus in a model where (0,0) is unstable, i.e. only one\nspecies survive, diffusion would change this instability and total extinction\n2\n2\ntakes place. We add the diffusion terms DM \u2202\u2202xM2 and DN \u2202\u2202xN2 to (1) and\n(2) respectively. Namely, consider the pair of reaction-diffusion evolution\nequations\ndM\n\u22022M\n= \u2212\u03b1\u2032 M \u2212 \u03b4NM + DM\n,\n(8)\ndt\n\u2202x2\ndN\n\u22022N\n= NF (N) \u2212 \u03b4NM + DN 2 .\n(9)\ndt\n\u2202x\nThe linear analysis of stability for the stationary point (0, 0) can be do in\n\n8\n\n\fthe usual way, namely, consider the small perturbation\nM = 0 + \u03b7,\n\n(10)\n\nN = 0 + \u03b5,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the variables \u03b7 and \u03b5 are assumed small. Equations (8) and (9), give\nthe first order linear equations\n\u22022\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b7\n= \u2212\u03b1\u2032 M\u03b7 + DM 2 ,\n(12)\n\u2202t\n\u2202 x\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u22022\u03b5\n= F (0)\u03b5 + DN 2 ,\n(13)\n\u2202t\n\u2202 x\nwhere we assume F (0) > 0, corresponding to the unstable case when migration is not present. For finite territory, solutions like \u03b5 \u223c e\u03c9t sin kx can\nbe visualized. The relationship between the stability parameter \u03c9 and the\nwavenumber k is given by\n\u03c9 = F (0) \u2212 k 2 DN ,\n\n(14)\n\nq\n\nand clearly for k > F (0)/DN the point (0, 0) becomes stable and total\nextinction in the niche exist. Since k \u223c L1 ,q\nwith L the territory size, equation\n(14) defines a critical size territory Lc \u223c DN /F (0) where total extinction\nholds. Namely, for all size territory L < Lc total extinction exist.\n\nIn conclusion: the principle of Gause was generalized to consider the case\nof biological struggle when one competing species is sterile. In fact, under\nappropriate conditions, total extinction could occur in the niche. Most of the\nagriculture competitive extermination method are carried-out assuming this\nprinciple. For instance, this is the case of extermination program of fruit flies\nwith sterile flies irradiated in laboratories [9-10]. We have presented a simple\nmodel which has total extinction in the niche in some cases. Conjectures\n9\n\n\frelated to a critical sterile-population (number of individuals) producing total\nextinction were pointed-out with a coarse criterion (4). This conjectures are\nbased in our numerical simulation of the model. The role of migration was\nbriefly discussed and the possibility of total extinction from diffusion was\nalso explored for small territories.\n\nTo ending, we note that our model can be extended to incorporates some\nmodifications. Particularly we are thinking about generalizations like:\n(i) Periodic variation of coefficients. In fact, in the extinction fruit flies\nprograms, daily, season or El ni\u00f1o (ENSO), oscillations must be considered.\n(ii) Sexual selection. Many extermination programs are based on sexual\nselection, namely, sterile-male released in a given niche. It creates interaction\nbetween sterile-male and fertile-female which becomes directly related to the\nevolution of the native-male. Such models require a phase-space greater than\ntwo.\n(iii) Many random factors are present in real niche. For instance, humidity, temperature, wind, etc. These factors can be incorporated in our model\nby introducing adequate sthocastic process for the parameter (\u03b1, \u03b2, or \u03b4).\n\nAcknowledgment: we thanks Hernan Donoso (S.
