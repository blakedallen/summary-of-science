The\nsharpness of the memory effect appears to decrease continuously with the spin anisotropy. Besides,\nthe spin glass coherence length is determined by magnetic field change experiments for the first time\nin the Ising sample. For three representative samples, from Heisenberg to Ising spin glasses, we\ncan consistently account for both sets of experiments (temperature cycle and magnetic field change)\nusing a single expression for the growth of the coherence length with time.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.Nr,75.50.Lk,75.40.Gb\n\nReal spin glasses (SGs), which are both disordered and\nfrustrated magnetic systems, are always found to be out\nof equilibrium on the laboratory time scale. When cooled\nbelow its freezing temperature Tg , a SG starts to age;\nfrom a completely random initial configuration, spin-spin\ncorrelations develop and progressively 'rigidify' the spin\nnetwork. If the SG is further cooled, the aging process\nrestarts (rejuvenation effect) but the previous aging is\nnot lost. When reheated, the SG retrieves its former\nstate (memory effect) and resumes its former evolution.\nThese memory and rejuvenation effects suggest a description in terms of a hierarchical organization of metastable\nstates as a function of the temperature [1], although an\nalternative description in terms of temperature chaos has\nalso been proposed [2]. Recently, a comparison between\nan Heisenberg and an Ising SG showed that the slow\ndynamic properties are quantitatively different in these\nsystems [3], the memory effect being more pronounced\nin the Heisenberg case. How are the spin anisotropy and\nthe aging properties related? Is there a systematic effect\nof the anisotropy? Answering these questions would shed\na new light on the longstanding and topical problem of\nthe nature of the Heisenberg SG phase [4]. The relevance\nof anisotropy for this problem is supported by the recent\nfinding that the critical exponents vary continuously with\nthe SG anisotropy [5].\nWe report in this letter on two classes of experiments.\nFirst, we have performed thermo-remanent magnetization (TRM) measurements with negative temperature cycles during aging in one Ising and several Heisenberg SGs\nin order to quantify the influence, at temperature T , of\naging at a slightly smaller temperature T \u2212 \u2206T . There\nis indeed a small cumulative effect from one temperature\nto the other which limits the sharpness in temperature\nof the memory effect. It is this cumulative effect that\nwe measure here as a function of the spin anisotropy.\nSecondly, we have performed new magnetic field change\nexperiments in the Ising sample. This protocol enables\nus to estimate the coherence length that grows during\nthe aging process. Both sets of experiments are success-\n\nfully analyzed within the framework proposed in Ref. [6]\n(building upon ideas developed in [7], see also [8]), which\nproposes a real space picture for the hierarchical organization of the SG states. In this model, at a given temperature and time scale, aging processes are associated\nto a specific length scale. Larger length scales are frozen\nwhile smaller length scales are fully equilibrated. Upon\nreducing the temperature and as a result of the change\nin the Boltzmann weights, the small length scales which\nwere equilibrated at higher temperature have to evolve\ntowards a new equilibrium state (rejuvenation). On the\nother hand, the structure at large length scales can no\nlonger evolve (memory). In this picture, the sharpness of\nthe memory effect is directly related to the rapid variation of the active length scale with temperature. A central concern of the present paper is to establish experimentally the time and temperature dependence of this\nactive length scale (see Eq. 4 below.)\nThe temperature cycle experiments were performed in\na monocrystalline Fe0.5 Mn0.5 TiO3 Ising [9] sample #1\n(Tg = 20.7K) and Heisenberg SGs with decreasing random anisotropy arising from Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions: an amorphous alloy (Fe0.1 Ni0.9 )75 P16 B6 Al3\n#2 (Tg = 13.4K), a diluted magnetic alloy Au:Fe8% #3\n(Tg = 23.9K), an insulating thiospinel CdCr1.7 In0.3 S4\n#4 (Tg = 16.7K) and we reproduce the data on the\ncanonical Ag:Mn2.7% SG #5 (Tg = 10.4K) from Ref. [10].\nThe relative anisotropy constants (K/Tg )/(K/Tg )Ag:Mn ,\nmeasured by torque experiments [5], are respectively\n16.5, 8.25, 5 and 1 for samples #2, #3, #4 and #5.\nAn isothermal TRM procedure allows one to define a set\nof reference curves that depend on the waiting time, and\nto which we will compare the relaxation curves obtained\nafter more complicated histories. In our series of temperature cycle experiments, the sample is first cooled to a\ntemperature T < Tg under a small magnetic field (a few\nOe). After waiting a time t1 = 500s, the sample is further\ncooled to a slightly smaller temperature T \u2212 \u2206T during\nt2 = 9000s and then re-heated to T for another short\ntime t3 = t1 (see inset in Fig. 2.).

The SGs are labelled from #1\nto #5 by order of decreasing anisotropy.\n\ntimes t1 and t3 permit to control any possible thermalization delays. The magnetic field is then switched off\nand the TRM is recorded. For each 'cycled' TRM curve,\nf\nan effective waiting time tef\nis defined such as to super2\nimpose the obtained TRM with one of the purely isothermal TRM recorded at temperature T , with waiting time\nf\ntw = t1 + tef\n2 (T, \u2206T ) + t3 . For \u2206T = 0, the effective\nwaiting time equals the actual waiting time but becomes\nf\nsmaller for \u2206T > 0: tef\n2 (T, \u2206T ) < t2 characterizes the\neffect at T of aging at T \u2212 \u2206T . The results for the different SGs and for two different temperatures, T /Tg \u2243 0.72\nand T /Tg \u2243 0.85, are plotted in Fig. 1 (for sample #5, a\nsimilar procedure, with t1 = t3 = 0, was applied [10]).\nf\nThe slope of tef\n2 /t2 vs \u2206T /T reflects the cumulative\neffect of aging from one temperature to the other. Hence,\nit quantifies the memory effect; the steeper the curve, the\nsharper the memory effect. For each of the temperatures\nT /Tg , the influence at T of aging at T \u2212 \u2206T is found\nto increase with increasing spin anisotropy. Note that,\nf\nat T /Tg = 0.72, the measured tef\nfor sample #3 are\n2\nslightly smaller than those of the less anisotropic sample\n#4. However, these two samples are very similar as far\nas their anisotropy is concerned since their anisotropy\nconstants differ only by 50% whereas from sample #1 to\n#5 they spread over more than one order of magnitude.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 5 below, for a given \u2206T /T ,\nthe effective time decreases with increasing temperature\nfor all the Heisenberg-like samples (samples #4 and #5).\nBy contrast, in the Ising sample #1, the influence at T\nof a T \u2212 \u2206T aging is slightly stronger at the higher temperature in the Ising case. Previous ac-measurements\non the Ising sample [3] demonstrated this singular behaviour even more clearly. At the higher temperature\n\nT /Tg = 0.84, the dynamics was in fact found to be almost critical (nearly no \u2206T dependence).\nTo interpret these experiments in a real space picture [6], we introduce a typical length scale l(tw , T ) over\nwhich spin-spin correlations establish at temperature T\nand waiting time tw . From general arguments, this coherence length l should be an increasing function of T\nand tw . For small \u2206T , the experimental TRM curves\nobtained after a temperature cycle superimpose onto reference isothermal curves. This implies that the SG has\nf\nreached the same state after a t1 + tef\nisothermal ag2\ning and the t1 + t2 experimental temperature cycle. We\ncan then sketch the temperature cycle experiment as in\nf\nFig. 2, where tef\nis defined by:\n2\nf\nl(t\u22171 + t2 , T \u2212 \u2206T ) = l(t1 + tef\n2 ,T)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t\u22171 is given by l(t1 , T ) = l(t\u22171 , T \u2212 \u2206T ). Note that\nthis picture which retains only the cumulative effect of\naging with temperature (no rejuvenation effect) is only\nvalid for small temperature cycle \u2206T . The slope of the\nf\nexperimental curve tef\n2 /t2 vs (\u2206T /T ), which quantifies\nthe sharpness of the memory effect, reads from Eq. (1)\nand for \u2206T /T \u226a 1 and t1 \u226a t2 :\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf\n\u2202l/\u2202 ln T\n\u2206T\ntef\n2\n\u22481\u2212\n.\n(2)\nt2\n\u2202l/\u2202 ln tw tw =t2 T\nAs announced, a sharp memory effect is related to a rapid\nvariation of l with the temperature.\nIn Ref. [11], magnetic field change experiments have\nbeen used to determine experimentally the SG coherence\nlength in the Heisenberg samples #4 and #5, that was\ncompared with numerical simulations corresponding to\nan Ising SG. However, the experimental determination\nof this length scale in the Ising case was not reported\nbefore.

More precisely, for\n\u221a Ising spins and for not too\nlarge fields, M should be N times the permanent moment m\u03bcB\u221aof one spin, implying that Ez is proportional\nto H and N (we used a moment of 4\u03bcB per spins obtained from the Curie constant above Tg ). Following\nRef. [11] and for the sake of simplicity, we then simply\nrelate the number N of dynamically correlated spins to\nthe coherence length through N = \u03b1l3 .\nThe results of the present study along with those reproduced for the Ag:Mn and the thiospinel samples [11] are\nplotted in Fig. 4 (in the Heisenberg case, Ez \u221d N and N\nwas extracted in this way in Ref. [11]). For a given waiting time and reduced temperature, the obtained number of correlated spins in the Ising sample is noticeably\nsmaller than in the Heisenberg samples studied so far, but\nthis number grows faster with time, indicating a slower\ngrowth of the energy barriers with size in the Ising sample. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the evolution of N with the\ntemperature in samples #1 and #4. Clearly, the separation of the active length scales with temperature (\"microscope effect\" of the temperature [6]) is much weaker\nin the Ising sample. This is in complete agreement with\nthe weak dependence on \u2206T found in the temperature\n\n0\n\nFIG. 4: Number of correlated spins extracted from field\nchange experiments in samples #1 at 0.72Tg and 0.92Tg , #4\nat 0.72Tg , 0.78Tg and 0.84T g, and #5 at 0.67Tg , 0.77Tg and\n0.86Tg .

[11], the correlation lengths were fitted by a universal power law\nl = b(tw /\u03c40 )aT /Tg (\u03c40 is the microscopic attempt time\nand is fixed to 10\u221212 s), in apparent agreement with numerical simulations performed on Ising systems [13]. This\npurely activated scenario would correspond to a single\nstraight line in Fig. 4, and by no means accounts for our\ndata in the Ising sample with the parameters used for the\nHeisenberg samples. Moreover, using Eq. (2), one would\nfind a slope \u2212 ln(t2 /\u03c40 ), independent of both a and b, for\nf\nthe curve tef\n2 /t2 vs (\u2206T /T ) shown in Fig. 1. This single value cannot reproduce the super-activated dynamics\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Parameters used in Eq. (4) to fit the temperature cycle (Fig. 5) and the magnetic field change experiments\n(Fig. 4). The only free parameters are \u03a50 , \u03c8, and z since the\nproduct z\u03bd is known (taken from Ref. [10] and [3]) and \u03c40 and\n\u03b1 have been fixed (see text).

Hence, the experimental data have led us to\npropose a crossover expression [3, 6, 14] (see also [8]):\n\u0001\n(4)\ntw = \u03c40\u2032 exp \u2206(T )l\u03c8 /T\n\nwhere \u03c40\u2032 = \u03c40 lz is a renormalized attempt time (critical\ndynamics) and \u2206(T ) = \u03a50 Tg (1 \u2212 T /Tg )\u03c8\u03bd is the typical\nbarrier height that vanishes at Tg (super-activated dynamics), following Ref. [7]. As usual, z is the dynamic\ncritical exponent and \u03bd is the critical exponent that governs the equilibrium correlation length. For each of the\nthree SG samples #1, #4 and #5, we have fitted the\nwhole set of experimental results to Eq. 4. These include\nall field change measurements shown in Fig. 4 and all\ntemperature cycling experiments shown in Fig. 5 (in this\ncase Eqs. 1 and 4 are used). A unique set of parameters\nis able to account for all the properties of each sample\n(see table I). In order to limit the degrees of freedom in\nour fit, we have imposed the z\u03bd values, taking those derived from dynamic critical scaling (see in refs in [3]). We\nhave also fixed the geometrical factor \u03b1 to 2 (N = \u03b1l3 ).\nThe parameters are not defined with a great quantitative\naccuracy, since their effects on the fit are strongly correlated. However, a consistent qualitative picture emerges.\nThe main tendency is an increasing value of the barrier\nheight parameter \u03a50 and a decreasing barrier exponent \u03c8\nfor increasing values of the anisotropy. This behavior of\nthe exponent \u03c8 is similar to that found in the analysis of\nac temperature cycling experiments [3], but it contrasts\nwith that derived from the scaling of \u03c7\u2032\u2032 relaxations [8],\nas well as with that found in the numerical simulation of\nRef. [14]. Note, however, that these previous determinations were based on a less constrained analysis and, for\nthe numerical work, on smaller time scales.\nWith a single expression for the growth of the active\nlength, Eq. (4), that interpolates between critical and activated dynamics, we have thus been able to reproduce\nconsistently two totally different sets of experiments, at\ndifferent temperatures, with a unique set of parameters\n(for each sample). This allows us to estimate the barrier\n\nheight \u03a50 and the barrier exponent \u03c8, which are notoriously hard to measure. As the anisotropy decreases\nfrom Ising to Heisenberg SGs, we find an increasingly fast\nseparation of the active length scales with temperature,\ncorresponding to an increased sharpness of the memory\neffect. Besides, we found that the extracted coherence\nlength is noticeably smaller in the Ising sample (large\n\u03a50 ) , but grows faster with time (small \u03c8). At present,\nit is not clear how the strong single spin anisotropy in\nthe Ising sample gives rise to both a high value of energy\nbarriers and a very small value of the barrier exponent.\nWithin a droplet description, \u03c8 \u2243 0 would imply that\nthe droplet energy exponent \u03b8 is also zero, in agreement\nwith many recent numerical works on excitations in Ising\nSGs [15]. Our results underline the role of anisotropy in\nthe nature of a SG phase with Heisenberg spins which\nis presently the subject of active investigations (see e.g.\nRef. [4, 5, 16]).\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n\nPresent address: Laboratoire de Physique des Solides,\nUniversit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, B\u00e2t. 510, 91405 Orsay, France\nPresent address: Laboratoire des Milieux D\u00e9sordonn\u00e9s et\nH\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, Universit\u00e9 Paris 6, Paris, France\nE.
