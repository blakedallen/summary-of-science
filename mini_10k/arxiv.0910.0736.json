Introduction\nIsospin violation in the Standard Model is driven by strong and electromagnetic interactions,\nthat is by the differences in the light quark masses and charges, respectively. Already in [1] Weinberg stressed that the pion\u2013nucleon scattering lengths offer a particularly good testing ground for\nstrong isospin violation, predicting e.g. a large effect in the difference of the neutral-pion\u2013nucleon\nscattering lengths a\u03c0 0 p \u2212 a\u03c0 0 n . Isospin violation in \u03c0 N scattering was addressed in the framework\nof heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) in a series of papers about a decade ago [2 \u2013 6].\nRecently, new interest arose in high-precision calculations of the pion\u2013nucleon scattering lengths.\nFirst, corrections for isospin violation are an essential ingredient to extract the isoscalar and isovector \u03c0 N scattering lengths a+ and a\u2212 from pionic hydrogen (\u03c0 H) and deuterium (\u03c0 D) measurements\nto high precision. The isospin-breaking corrections to a\u03c0 \u2212 p\u2192\u03c0 \u2212 p needed for the ground state of \u03c0 H\nwere calculated in [7] at third chiral order. A consistent description requires the knowledge of\na\u03c0 \u2212 p\u2192\u03c0 0 n (width of \u03c0 H) and a\u03c0 \u2212 n\u2192\u03c0 \u2212 n (ground state of \u03c0 D) at the same accuracy. In the analysis\nof \u03c0 D isospin violation is particularly important, since the \u03c0 d scattering length at leading order\nis proportional to the small isoscalar scattering length a+ and therefore chirally suppressed [8].\nSecond, threshold pion photoproduction offers the unique possibility of measuring the so far undetermined \u03c0 0 p scattering length and gives access to the charge exchange scattering length a\u03c0 + n\u2192\u03c0 0 p\n[9, 10]. Such measurements are becoming feasible at HI\u03b3 S and at MAMI. In view of these developments, we have extended the work of [7] to all charge channels in pion\u2013nucleon scattering\nin [11].\n\n2. Formalism\nThe calculation of the scattering lengths is performed at O(p3 ) in manifestly covariant baryon\nChPT [12] and at first order in the isospin-breaking parameter \u03b4 = O(e2 , md \u2212 mu ), using the effective Lagrangian for nucleons, pions, and virtual photons, as constructed in [7]. We denote\nthe masses of proton, neutron, charged and neutral pion by mp , mn , M\u03c0 , and M\u03c0 0 , respectively,\nand define the isospin limit by the charged particles. The mass differences are expressed by\n\u2206\u03c0 = M\u03c02 \u2212 M\u03c020 and \u2206N = mn \u2212 mp .\nThe one-loop topologies are depicted in Fig. 1. As soon as we take into account virtual photons, we have to specify how to deal with the threshold divergences: first of all, we subtract all\none-photon-reducible diagrams, since they diverge \u223c 1/t (s and t are the usual Mandelstam variables), and denote the resulting amplitude by T\u0303 . The additional divergences due to photon loops\nmay be regularized in the form\neiQ\u03b1\u03b8C (|p|) T\u0303\n\n|p|\u21920\n\n=\n\n\u03b21\n|p|\n+ Tthr + O(|p|),\n+ \u03b22 log\n|p|\n\u03bcc\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere p denotes the center-of-mass momentum, \u03b1 = e2 /4\u03c0 the fine structure constant, \u03b8C (|p|) the\ninfrared divergent Coulomb phase given by\n\n\u03b8C (|p|) = \u2212\n\nm\u03b3\n\u03bcc\nlog\n,\n|p|\n2|p|\n\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fIsospin-breaking corrections to the pion\u2013nucleon scattering lengths\n\nMartin Hoferichter\n\n(s1 )\n\n(s2 )\n\n(s3 )\n\n(s4 )\n\n(s5 )\n\n(s6 )\n\n(v1 )\n\n(v2 )\n\n(v3 )\n\n(v4 )\n\n(v5 )\n\n(a1 )\n\n(a2 )\n\n(a3 )\n\nFigure 1: One-loop topologies for \u03c0 N scattering at threshold.

For the analytical results and more details of the calculation we refer to [11].\n\n3. Numerical results\nIn the isospin limit, the \u03c0 N scattering lengths are solely determined by a+ and a\u2212 .

It remains to be seen whether\nthe nice consistency between the three bands persists once isospin violation in the few-body part is\nincluded.\n\n5. Summary and outlook\nWe have systematically analyzed isospin violation in the \u03c0 N scattering lengths in all channels,\nincluding an estimate of the theoretical uncertainties. We find that isospin breaking is quite small\nin \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n, at the order of one percent at most, whereas the charged-pion elastic channels\ndisplay more sizeable effects on the few-percent level. In particular, the triangle relation is violated\nby about 1.5% consistent with earlier findings in heavy-baryon ChPT and inconsistent with the\n5\u20137% deviation extracted from the data at lowest pion momenta in [23, 24]. In addition, we find\na substantial isospin-breaking correction to the neutral-pion\u2013proton scattering length. Finally, we\nhave shown that in a full O(p3 ) calculation the value of the isoscalar scattering length will increase\nas compared to previous analyses of hadronic atoms [8].\nAn extension of this analysis beyond threshold for \u03c0 \u00b1 p \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 p and \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n can be found\nin [25], while a full calculation of isospin violation in the few-body contributions to the \u03c0 d scattering length will be addressed in [26].\ninput: level shift of \u03c0 H: \u03b51s = (\u22127.120 \u00b1 0.017) eV [17], width of \u03c0 H: \u03931s = (0.823 \u00b1 0.019) eV\n[18], and \u03c0 \u2212 d scattering length: a\u03c0 d = (\u22120.0261 \u00b1 0.0005) M\u03c0\u22121 [19].\n1 Experimental\n\n4\n\n\fIsospin-breaking corrections to the pion\u2013nucleon scattering lengths\n\nMartin Hoferichter\n\nFigure 2: Constraints on a\u2212 and \u00e3+ provided by the level shift of \u03c0 H and \u03c0 D and the width of \u03c0 H.
