Introduction\nDoppler studies with high-precision instruments and reduction algorithms have been refined dramatically, mainly\nin the framework of the search for exoplanets. These refinements have led to a breakthrough in the observations\nof solar-type oscillations, which have now been found repeatedly (Procyon, Martic et al. 1999; \u03b2 Hyi, Bedding et\nal. 2001; \u03b1 Cen A, Bouchy & Carrier 2001; \u03b4 Eri, Carrier\net al. 2002). The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the oscillation frequency spectra is, for each of these cases, so good\nthat the resemblance with the solar oscillation spectrum\nis obvious.\nObservations of solar-like oscillations in the giant star\n\u03b1 UMa have been claimed by Buzasi et al. (2000), based\nupon space photometry gathered with the star tracker of\nthe WIRE satellite. However, the interpretation of these\nreported oscillations frequencies is not straightforward.\nGuenther et al. (2000) find a possible solution in terms\nof a sequence of radial modes with a few missing orders\nfor a star of 4.0\u20134.5 M\u2299 . The interpretation is not supported by theoretical calculations by Dziembowski et al.\n(2001). Velocity observations of Arcturus provide evidence\nSend offprint requests to: S. Frandsen\n\u22c6\nBased on observations obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph on the 1.2-m Swiss Euler telescope at La Silla, Chile.\n\nfor solar-type oscillations with periods from 1.7 to 8.3\ndays and a frequency separation of evenly spaced modes of\n\u2206\u03bd \u223c 1.2 \u03bcHz (Merline, 1999). WIRE data (Retter et al.\n2002), however, points to an excess power at 4.1 \u03bcHz and\na frequency spacing of \u2206\u03bd = 0.8 \u03bcHz.\nIn this Letter , we provide clear evidence for the presence of solar-type oscillations in the giant star \u03be Hya\n(mV = 3.54). This star has a mass close to M = 3.0 M\u2299 ,\nand is thus considerably heavier than the Sun. Moreover,\nits luminosity amounts to L \u223c 61 L\u2299 and its effective temperature Teff = 5000 K, which places the star among the\ngiants. In the current Letter we present the first results\nof our study. Detailed modelling will be presented, when\ncompleted, in a subsequent paper.\n\n2. The radial-velocity measurements\nThe \u03be Hya observations were made during one full month\n(2002 February 18 - March 18) with Coralie, the highresolution fiber-fed echelle spectrograph (Queloz et al.\n2001) mounted on the 1.2-m Swiss telescope at La Silla\n(ESO, Chile). During the stellar exposures, the spectrum\nof a thorium lamp carried by a second fiber is simultaneously recorded in order to monitor the spectrograph's stability and thus to obtain high-precision velocity measurements. The spectra were extracted at the telescope, using\nthe INTER-TACOS (INTERpreter for the Treatment, the\n\n\f2\n\nS. Frandsen et al.: Detection of Solar-like Oscillations in the G7 Giant Star \u03be Hya\n\nFig. 1. Radial-velocity measurements of \u03be Hya. The dispersion reaches 4.6 m s\u22121 . a) The whole time string; b)\nzoom of a small part of the time series.\n\nAnalysis and the COrrelation of Spectra) software package developed by D. Queloz and L. Weber at the Geneva\nObservatory (Baranne et al. 1996). The wavelength coverage of these spectra is 3875-6820 \u00c5, recorded on 68 orders. By taking about 2 measurements every hour, a total\nof 433 optical spectra was collected. The exposure times\nwere typically 180 s and the S/N ratio for all spectra was\nin the range of 110\u2013230 at 550 nm.\nBy the use of the optimum-weight procedure (Bouchy\net al. 2001), radial velocities are computed for each night\nrelative to the highest S/N spectrum obtained in the middle of the night. This method requires a Doppler shift that\nremains small compared to the line-width (smaller than\n100 m s\u22121 ) (Bouchy & Carrier 2001). Since the Earth's motion can introduce a Doppler shift larger than 800 m s\u22121\nduring a whole night, each spectrum is first corrected for\nthe Earth's motion before deriving the radial velocities.\nThis is achieved by shifting all spectra with the Earth's\nvelocity at the time of observation and by subsequent rebinning, so that the spectra all have the same wavelength\nvalues. From each rebinned spectrum a velocity is derived.\nThe mean radial velocity for each night is then subtracted.\nThe resulting velocities are shown in Fig. 1. The rms scatter of the time series is 4.6 m s\u22121 and is largely due to\nthe oscillations. The mean error on each measurement is\n2.3 m s\u22121 .\n\nFig. 2. Power spectrum for \u03be Hya. Modes are clearly\npresent in the range 50\u2013130 \u03bcHz, corresponding to periods of 2.0-5.5 hours. Panel a) is the power spectrum of\nthe time series using one single spectrum as the reference.\nPanel b) is for the time series derived using one reference\nspectrum per night. The insert in Panel b) shows the window function. The frequency scale is made similar to the\nmain plot to facilitate comparison.\n\n3. Time-series analysis\nThe power spectrum of the 433 data points is presented in\nFig. 2. In order to show that the excess power in the lower\npanel in the range 50\u2013130 \u03bcHz is not due to elimination\nof power at low frequencies by the reduction procedure,\nwe show a power spectrum in the upper panel where no\ncorrection for drift has been applied. Although more noisy\nthe increase in power between 50 \u03bcHz and 130 \u03bcHz is also\nevident in the upper panel. A set of oscillation modes is\nclearly present, with a power distribution that is remarkably similar to that seen in the Sun and other stars on or\nnear the main sequence, although obviously at much lower\nfrequency. We will show the spectrum displays the characteristic near-uniform spacing of the dominant peaks.\nTo characterize this pattern we have calculated the autocorrelation of the power spectrum. In order to eliminate\nthe effect of the noise, we have ignored all points with amplitudes below a given threshhold (1.2 m s\u22121 ). In Fig. 3\nthe alias at 1 c/d stands out clearly, but in addition a\nspacing \u2206\u03bd \u223c 6.8 \u03bcHz is present in the power spectrum.\nThis is consistent with the visual impression of a regular\npattern present in the the power spectrum (Fig. 2).\nThe expected velocity amplitude for solar-like oscillations scales as L/M according to Kjeldsen & Bedding\n(1995). Using the stellar parameters from Sect. 4 and a\nmass of 3.0 M\u2299 (Sect. 4) we find vosc,pred = 4.6 m s\u22121 . The\n\n\fS.

Formal errors of\nthe fit are given in parenthesis as errors of the last digits.\nThe S/N is calculated by dividing the amplitude by the\nnoise in a 10 \u03bcHz bin in the residual spectrum centered on\nthe frequency of the mode.

Autocorrelation of the power spectrum for \u03be Hya.\nAll points with amplitude v < 1.2 m s\u22121 have been set to\nzero. The dash-dot-dot-dot vertical lines mark the position\nof the 11.574 \u03bcHz daily alias and half of it, and the dashdot line indicates the peak pointing to a frequency spacing\nof 6.8 \u03bcHz.\n\nobserved amplitudes in Fig. 2 are only about one third of\nthis prediction. Recent calculations by Houdek & Gough\n(2002), however, indicate that the simple scaling law of\nKjeldsen & Bedding (1995) does indeed not apply. They\npredict a velocity amplitude v = 2.1 m s\u22121 , slightly higher\nthan the ones observed by us for \u03be Hya.\nThe stochastic nature of solar-like oscillations implies\nthat a timestring of radial velocities cannot be expected\nto be a set of coherent oscillations and can therefore not\nbe reproduced perfectly by a sum of sinusoidal terms. As a\nstarting point it is nevertheless a good assumption to try\nto fit the radial-velocity data of \u03be Hya by such a set of functions, as the lifetimes are expected to exceed the length\nof the observing run (Houdek & Gough 2002). We have\nperformed an iterative fit using different methods, among\nwhich Period98 (Sperl 1998) and a procedure by Frandsen\net al. (2001). An oscillation with a S/N above 4 is detected\nat 9 frequencies. When a fit based upon these 9 frequencies is removed from the time series, 5 additional peaks\nstill occur but with a too low S/N to accept them without\nadditional confirmation (hence we do not list them). After\nremoving the 14 frequencies, only a noise spectrum is left.\nThe results for the 9 frequencies are presented in Table 1,\nwhere the S/N indicated is calculated from the remaining noise in the amplitude spectrum at the position of\neach mode. The noise is slightly higher in the range of the\nmodes than at high frequencies, where \u03c3 = 0.2 m s\u22121 . The\nfrequencies of the modes with amplitudes above 1.5 m s\u22121 ,\ni.e., of the five highest-amplitude modes, are unambiguous. Dividing the dataset in two, four out of five modes\nwith S/N > 5.0 are present in each set. For lower S/N\nthe alias problems lead to a risk that false detections are\nmade. Modes with S/N < 5 must be considered with some\ncaution. Confirmation of these frequencies is needed by\nadditional observations.

Some n\nvalues are missing. The maximum deviation from the line\nis 1.14 \u03bcHz (Table 1). The regularity seen is similar to the\nresults reported for Arcturus (Merline, 1999) and \u03b1 UMa\n(Guenther et al., 2000). The first seven modes could all be\nradial modes, although we cannot rule out the possibility\nof alternating degree l = 0 and l = 1 modes. This, however, is not consistent with the model presented in Sect.\n4.\nFrom the present data, we cannot firmly exclude that\nfrequency F8 in Table 1 corresponds to the same mode as\nF7. The two modes are resolved, but if the damping time\nis short, they might be different realizations of the same\nmode.\n\n4. First interpretation\nIn order to study the nature of the oscillations detected in\n\u03be Hya, it is necessary to compare the observed frequency\nspectrum with model predictions, taking into account the\nconstraints on the three observational stellar parameters\nTeff , L and Z. We have redetermined the atmospheric parameters and use Teff = 5000 \u00b1 100 K, L = 61.1 \u00b1 6.2 L\u2299 ,\nlog g = 2.85, [M/H] = 0.06 \u00b1 0.07 (Z = 0.019 \u00b1 0.006) and\nv sin i = 1.8 \u00b1 1.0 km s\u22121 . Details of how these values were\nobtained will be reported in a subsequent paper.\nUsing the evolution code of Christensen-Dalsgaard\n(1982), evolutionary tracks were produced, spanning the\nerror box defined by the uncertainties of Teff , L and Z.\n\n\f4\n\nS. Frandsen et al.: Detection of Solar-like Oscillations in the G7 Giant Star \u03be Hya\n\nmodes that have an almost equidistant separation around\n7.1 \u03bcHz.\nA most important and exciting result of our study is\nthe confirmation of the possibility, suggested by the results\nreported on \u03b1 UMa and Arcturus, to observe solar-like\noscillations in stars on the red giant branch. This opens\nthe red part of the HR diagram for detailed seismic studies.\nThe latter require an accuracy within the range of current\nand future ground-based instruments. Such future studies\nwill only be successful if an extremely high stability of\nthe instrument is achieved and if one performs multisite\nobserving campaigns covering several months in order to\nresolve the frequency spectrum of the oscillations and to\neliminate the aliasing problems.\nFig. 4. Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary\ntracks for Z = 0.019 for masses 3.07M\u2299 (solid line), 2.93\nand 3.15M\u2299 (lower and upper dashed lines, respectively).\nThe location of \u03be Hya in the diagram is given by the error\nbox.\nThe model tracks were computed using the EFF equation\nof state (Eggleton et al. 1973), OPAL opacities (Iglesias,\nRogers & Wilson 1992), Bahcall & Pinsonneault (1992)\nnuclear cross sections, and the mixing-length formalism\n(MLT) for convection.\nThe evolutionary track passing through the observed\n(Teff , L) corresponds to a mass of 3.07M\u2299 for Z = 0.019\n(Fig. 4). Oscillation frequencies were calculated for the\nmodel in that track closest to the observed location of\n\u03be Hya in the HR diagram. The average separation between\nradial modes in the range 50\u2013100 \u03bcHz is \u2206\u03bdtheo = 7.2 \u03bcHz\nin agreement with the observational value. The model frequencies fit a linear relation for orders 5 < n < 17 or\n50 < \u03bd < 125 \u03bcHz given by \u03bd = 7.15 + 7.14 n with absolute values only 1\u20132 \u03bcHz from the observed frequencies.\nThe maximum deviation of the model frequencies from\nthe line is \u223c 0.5 \u03bcHz.\nRadial modes are expected to dominate the spectrum\nfor giant stars (cf. Dziembowski et al. 2001, Fig. 2).\nFurther analysis of the spectrum is beyond the scope of\nthe current discovery paper and will be done in a forthcoming paper, dealing in detail with the issue of modelling\nand considering also the possibility that \u03be Hya could be a\ncore helium burning star with a smaller mass.\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe main conclusions of this study are as follows. Solarlike oscillations have been firmly discovered in the bright\nG7III star \u03be Hya. The amplitudes of the strongest modes\nare somewhat below 2 m s\u22121 . The observed frequency distribution of the modes detected (Table 1) is in agreement\nwith theoretically calculated frequencies both in terms\nof the spacing and the absolute values. The modes with\nthe largest amplitudes can be well matched with radial\n\nAcknowledgements.
