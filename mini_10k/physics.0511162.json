These include the determination of the Rydberg constant and\ntests of quantum electrodynamics theory [2, 3], determination of nuclear properties of the proton and deuteron\n[3, 4], spectroscopy of Bose-Einstein condensate in hydrogen [5], hyperfine structure measurements of the 2S\nstate [6], and searching for the drift of the fine structure\nconstant [7].\nIn all of these experiments, the 2S state was excited\nby the second harmonic of a stabilized dye laser operating at 486 nm. The dye laser system originally developed in Garching has been repeatedly upgraded to\nmeet the stringent requirements of high-resolution spectroscopic experiments. The uncertainty in recent 1S \u22122S\nfrequency measurements in atomic hydrogen is 25 Hz\n(\u2206f /f0 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221214) [7]. However, an uncertainty limit\nnear the natural linewidth of 1.3 Hz is desirable. In addition to improving the accuracy of these measurements,\nit would be helpful to reduce the size of the experiment.\nThis is not only necessary for metrological applications\nsuch as creating a transportable optical frequency reference, but also for opening possibilities for completely new\nexperiments to test some fundamental aspects of physics.\nFor example, a number of recently proposed experiments concern spectroscopy of exotic atomic systems\nwhich are not available in the laboratory. This will require a new laser system to be set up close to the place\nwhere the atomic sample is produced. Experiments to\nstudy the 1S \u2212 2S spectroscopy in anti-hydrogen are prepared by the collaborations ATHENA (ALPHA) [8] and\nATRAP [9] at CERN. A comparison between hydrogen\nand anti-hydrogen spectra should provide one of the most\nstringent tests of the CPT theorem.

In addition, there is an\non-going activity on optical spectroscopy of positronium\nand muonium [11, 12, 13].\nIn this paper we report a compact, transportable laser\nsystem which is suitable for such experiments. In the\nfuture it can replace stable but rather bulky dye-laser\nsystems [7].\nThe laser source is a frequency-quadrupled masteroscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) system [14] (see Fig.\n1). It is similar to the laser source demonstrated in Ref.\n[15]. An anti-reflection coated laser diode operating at\n972 nm is placed in an external Littrow cavity. The output is amplified using a tapered amplifier (TA), producing up to 650 mW at 972 nm. This is coupled to the first\ndoubling stage (SHG 1 in Fig. 1) consisting of a bow-tie\nbuild-up cavity around a KNbO3 crystal. The crystal is\nused at normal incidence and is cut for phase matching\nat a temperature of 30 degrees. The cavity is locked to\nthe laser using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique\n[17], with a modulation frequency of 20 MHz. We have\nmeasured up to 210 mW at 486 nm. The astigmatism\nin this beam profile is corrected using a telescope with\ncylindrical lenses.\nThe light at 486 nm is split into two beams. About 10\nmW is taken for frequency stabilization of the laser, while\nthe remainder is sent to the second doubling stage (SHG\n2 in Fig. 1) after proper mode-matching. The second\nfrequency-doubling stage is a compact delta shape buildup cavity around a BBO crystal [16]. After astigmatism\ncompensation, we measure up to 20 mW at 243 nm in\na near-Gaussian profile. The master oscillator, tapered\namplifier, both doubling stages (SHG 1 and SHG 2), and\nsome auxiliary optics are mounted on a single 60 \u00d7 120\ncm2 optical breadboard.\nAfter a few months of operation, the output of the\nsystem decreased due to degradation of the TA beam\nprofile. Laser powers were limited to 130 mW at 486\nnm and 4.5 mW at 243 nm. Measurements reported in\nthis paper were performed at this power level, which was\nenough to detect the 1S \u2212 2S transition.\nThe laser is actively stabilized to a high-finesse cavity\nat 486 nm [18].

The output of the stabilized dye laser at\n486 nm is superimposed with the output of the SHG 1 and\nis used both for the beat signal detection using a radio frequency (RF) spectrum analyzer and for generation of 243 nm\nradiation. The hydrogen spectra are detected alternatively\neither using the dye laser system or the solid-state one.\n\nto a spacer produced from ultra-low expansion (ULE)\nglass. The finesse of the cavity is 75,000, and the transmission peak is about 15 kHz full width at half maximum (FWHM). The cavity rests on a ceramic support in\na small vacuum chamber and can be fixed for transportation. The chamber is surrounded by single-stage temperature stabilization system and is placed in a 60 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60\ncm3 isolating box.\nThe ULE cavity is placed on a separate optical table.\nThe 486 nm light from SHG 1 is delivered to the cavity by an optical fiber. To compensate for the frequency\nnoise introduced by the fiber, a standard fiber noise compensation scheme is implemented. The laser frequency is\nstabilized to the cavity by a PDH lock at 11 MHz. The\nlaser frequency can be shifted in respect to the frequency\nof the cavity mode using a double-pass acousto-optical\nmodulator. The fact that we use the second harmonic\nfor generating the PDH error signal does not change the\nphase characteristics of the lock since the transmission\npeak of the SHG 1 is much broader then the bandwidth\nof the laser frequency noise.\nThe error signal is split into three channels.

The dashed line shows a Lorentzinan fit with\na 1 kHz FWHM.\n\nfeedback is sent to the modulation input of the current\ncontroller. The low-frequency drift of the laser cavity\nis also compensated, using slow feedback to the grating. This feedback configuration is similar to that used\nin Refs. 19 and 20. The amplitude of the closed-loop\nerror signal measured in 50 kHz bandwidth corresponds\nto frequency noise on the level of 100 Hz at 486 nm.\nThe power spectrum of the diode laser is studied by\nhelp of the independent stabilized dye laser used for the\nprevious measurements [7]. The dye laser is locked to a\nnon-transportable high-finesse ULE cavity which has significantly better acoustic isolation and temperature control compared to the cavity used for the diode laser stabilization. The typical frequency drift of the stabilized\ndye laser is on the level of about 0.2 Hz/s and its spectral line width \u2206\u03bddye is characterized as 60 Hz at 486 nm\n[21]. The power spectrum of the beat note between the\ntwo laser systems is presented in Fig.2. The spectrum is\ndefined by characteristics of the diode laser system, since\non the given scale the dye laser possesses a negligible\nspectral line width and frequency drift and is essentially\nfree of sidebands.\nOne can observe broad sidebands originating from the\nfast current feedback of the diode laser. The amplitude of\nthe sidebands is sensitive to the strength of the feedback:\nwith stronger feedback, more laser power is pushed into\nthe sidebands. The central peak of the spectrum has a\nwidth of 1.0 kHz FWHM at 486 nm. This mainly stems\nfrom acoustic vibrations of the transportable cavity to\nwhich the diode laser is locked.\nThe frequency drift of the diode laser can also be characterized using beat-note measurements. It is approximately 10 Hz/s at 486 nm, more then ten times higher\nthen the frequency drift of the non-transportable cavity. Once again, this difference is attributable mainly\n\n\f3\nfrequency, the measurement cycle is repeated for 1 s, and\nphoton counts are accumulated by a multi-channel scaler.\nThus we simultaneously record a number of delayed spectra corresponding to different velocity classes. This detection scheme allows for evaluation of the second-order\nDoppler effect and reduces the background level that is\ndue to scattered 243 nm radiation.\nA time-resolved spectrum of the 1S \u2212 2S transition\nexcited using the new laser system is presented in Fig.3\n(top), where the photon count rate is plotted versus frequency detuning at 243 nm. The spectral line width of\n1S\u22122S\nthe transition \u2206fdiode\nequals 2.8(1) kHz FWHM for\n\u03c4 = 10 \u03bcs and reduces to 2.2(1) kHz for \u03c4 = 610 \u03bcs.\nBesides the contribution of the finite line width of the\nexcitation radiation, the 1S \u2212 2S transition line width\nis defined by time-of-flight broadening, power broadening, ionization broadening, and the second-order Doppler\neffect. The delayed detection significantly reduces the\ntime-of-flight broadening and the second-order Doppler\neffect due to the velocity selection. To analyze the spectrum, we compare it to the calculated line shape in\nthe case of an infinitely narrow-band excitation spectrum using a Monte-Carlo approach [22]. For the delay\n\u03c4 = 610 \u03bcs, the simulated line has a FWHM at 243 nm\nof \u2206ftheor (610 \u03bcs) = 0.62 kHz when 2.6 mW of 243 nm\nradiation coupled to the enhancement cavity.\nAssuming Lorentzian profiles, one can write the following approximate relation:\nFIG. 3: Top: 1S \u22122S time-resolved spectra recorded with the\ndiode laser source. The power of 243 nm radiation coupled\nto the enhancement cavity equals 2.6 mW. Bottom: 1S \u2212 2S\nspectra recorded with the dye laser source at the power of\n2.2 mW. In each case two spectra recorded in two different\nscan directions are averaged and the drift of the corresponding\nreference cavity is compensated.\n\nto the optical cavity to which the diode laser is locked.\nThe transportable cavity uses a simpler temperature controller and has greater thermal coupling to its ceramic\nsupport.\nWe tested the new diode laser source using the hydrogen spectrometer [7, 21] depicted schematically in Fig.1.\nThe 243 nm radiation is coupled to a linear enhancement cavity, where the excitation of the hydrogen beam\ntakes place. The flow of atomic hydrogen produced in a\nradio-frequency gas discharge is cooled to 5 K by a flowthrough cryostat. After a 3 ms excitation phase, the 243\nlight is blocked by a chopper operating at 160 Hz, and\nthe detection phase begins. Atoms in the 2S state coming to the detection zone are quenched in a weak electric\nfield. Emitted Lyman-alpha photons are detected by a\nphotomultiplier tube, and counts are accumulated until\nthe beginning of a new excitation phase. By introducing\na delay time \u03c4 between the end of the excitation and the\nstart of detection, we select slow atoms from the original\nMaxwellian distribution. The delay of \u03c4 = 1 ms corresponds to the cut-off velocity of 130 m/s.

Factor 2 results from\ntwo-photon excitation of the 1S \u2212 2S transition. In this\nparticular case, the line width of the 1S\u22122S transition for\nlonger delay times is mainly defined by the spectral line\nwidth of the excitation radiation. The spectral resolution\n1S\u22122S\n(610 \u03bcs) equals 6 \u00d7 1011.\nof the spectrometer f0 /\u2206fdiode\nTo compare the diode laser source with the dye laser,\nwe also performed a set of measurements with the dye\nlaser coupled to the same doubling stage as depicted\nin Fig.1. A 1S \u2212 2S spectrum recorded using the dye\nlaser at a similar excitation power level is shown in\nFig.3(bottom). The recorded lines are considerably narrower compared to the case of the diode laser. The\nline shape asymmetry resulting from the second-order\nDoppler effect is clearly visible for short delays. The\namplitude noise partly results from the intensity fluctuations of the dye laser. The widths of the delayed\nspectra are close to the calculated ones: for example,\n1S\u22122S\n\u2206fdye\n(610 \u03bcs) = 0.75(5) kHz at 243 nm.\nThe 2S count rate using the diode laser is approximately three times lower than using the dye laser. Besides slightly different excitation powers, the difference\nin the count rates can be explained by two factors: (i)\nthe broader line width of the diode laser and (ii) the distribution of the laser diode power over a wide spectral\nrange. The loss of the 2S counts in the narrow 1S \u2212 2S\nline is caused by distributed features in the spectrum of\n\n\f4\nthe diode laser.\nSince the dye laser spectrum is practically free from the\nbackground, one can evaluate separately the effect of the\ndistributed spectrum of the diode laser. To do it, we have\nto take into account the difference in the spectral widths\nof the central peak of the diode laser spectrum used for\nspectroscopy and the spectral width of the dye laser. Under the realistic approximations \u2206ftheor \u226b 2\u2206\u03bddye and\n\u2206ftheor \u226a 2\u2206\u03bddiode , it is equivalent to the comparison of\nthe areas under corresponding transitions normalized to\nthe 243 nm power squared. The 2S excitation efficiency\nfor the diode laser source is 40(10)% of the efficiency for\nthe dye laser. This number is constant for all available\ndelays. This means that for the same excitation powers\nand for the same line widths of the lasers, the diode laser\nwould excite only 40% of the atoms in a narrow spectral\nline compared to the dye laser.\nIt should be possible to narrow the spectrum of the\ndiode laser using a two-stage, two-cavity lock scheme.\nOur diode laser is stabilized to a high-finesse cavity, and\nhas a spectral width of approximately 1 kHz at 486 nm.\nThis residual width could be removed relative to a second\ncavity using an AOM. It is not enough simply to increase\n\n[1] T.W. H\u00e4nsch, Laser Spectroscopy III, 149 Springer Series\nin Optical Sciences 7, J.L. Hall J. L. Carlsten, Springer,\nBerlin/New York (1977).\n[2] F.

Increasing\nthe gain only produces larger sidebands in the beat signal spectrum (see Fig. 2) and a subsequent loss of 2S\nexcitation efficiency.\nIn summary, a high-power narrow-bandwith diode\nlaser source is reported that is capable of driving the\n1S \u2212 2S transition in atomic hydrogen with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The spectral width of the laser\nis 2 kHz at 243 nm, limited mainly by the characteristics of the small, transportable optical cavity. Implementing the new concept of vertically-suspended reference cavities [23] and a spacer with the proper choice\nof ULE zero-expansion point will significantly increase\nthe short- and long-term frequency stability of the diode\nlaser source while keeping the whole system compact and\ntransportable. This laser system is a promising source\nfor spectroscopy of exotic hydrogen-like systems such as\nanti-hydrogen, tritium, positronium, and muonium.\nN.K. acknowledges the support of DFG (grant No.\n436RUS113/769/0-1) and RFBR (grants.
