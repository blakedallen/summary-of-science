The initial state can never be recovered\nafter a projection measurement on a quantum system.\nIf the measurement is not sharp (i.e., non-projective\nmeasurement), however, the situation is different. It is\npossible to reverse the measurement-induced state collapse and the unsharpness of a measurement has been\nshown to be related to the probabilistic nature of the reversing operation which can serve as a probabilistic quantum error correction [3]. In particular, practical schemes\nfor reversing the state collapse due to a weak (or partialcollapse) measurement in a solid-state qubit have been\nproposed in Ref. [4] and one of the schemes has recently\nbeen demonstrated using a superconducting phase qubit\nin Ref. [5].\nSince single-photon states and linear optics play important roles in quantum communication and quantum\ncomputing research [6, 7, 8, 9], it is of interest and importance to investigate how the measurement-induced state\ncollapse due to a weak measurement can be reversed for\na photonic qubit. In this letter, we report a linear optical implementation of conditional reversal of weak (or\npartial-collapse) quantum measurements on a photonic\nqubit. We demonstrate experimentally that a nonunitary transformation of a photonic qubit, caused by a\nweak quantum measurement, can be reversed by applying an appropriately designed reversing operation. We\nalso quantify and experimentally study information gain\ndue to the weak measurement and discuss the role of the\nreversing operation as an information erasure.\nConsider the initial state of a qubit represented in\nthe computational basis, |\u03c8o i = \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, where\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: yskim25@postech.ac.kr\naddress: yoonho@postech.ac.kr\n\n|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Ordinary projection measurement in the\ncomputational basis would collapse the state into |0i (or\n|1i) with the probability equal to |\u03b1|2 (or |\u03b2|2 ). The projection measurement cannot be reversed because the projection operators P0 = |0ih0| = ( 10 00 ) and P1 = |1ih1| =\n( 00 01 ) do not have mathematical inverse. An unsharp\nmeasurement on the qubit, however, can be reversible\n(although with a less than unity success probability) and\nthe probability of successful reversal is related to the unsharpness of the measurement [3].\nThe unsharp measurement that we consider in this paper is the weak or partial-collapse measurement discussed\nRef. [4, 5], originally intended for a solid-state qubit. An\nessential part of the weak measurement is a detector,\nwhich measures the qubit, function as follows: the detector clicks with a probability p if the qubit is in the |1i\nstate and never clicks if the qubit is in the |0i state. The\ndetector, thus, provides some partial information about\nthe initial state of the qubit and, as we shall show later,\nthe detector's output (click or no click) can be used to\nguess the initial state.\nLet us first assume that the detector has clicked. This\nsituation is identical to the normal projection measurement in which the state of the qubit is irrevocably collapsed to the |1i state. The measurement operator de\u221a\nscribing\n\u0012\n\u0013this situation can be written as M1 = p|1ih1| =\n0 0\n\u221a . With no mathematical inverse, M1 is not re0 p\nversible and, therefore, is of no interest to us.\nNow, consider the situation in which the detector\nhas not clicked. The measurement operator M2 corresponding to this situation can be evaluated by us\u2020\ning the relation 1 = M1\u2020 M1 + M\n\u0012 2 M2 and\u0013is given by\n\u221a\n1 \u221a 0\n. The null\nM2 = |0ih0| + 1 \u2212 p|1ih1| =\n0 1\u2212p\noutput of the detector, therefore, corresponds to applying the M2 measurement operator to the qubit and this\nis precisely the weak (or partial-collapse) measurement\nthat we are interested in this paper.\nThe state of the qubit right after the null\noutcome of the detector is given as, |\u03c8m i =\n\n\f2\nq\nM2 |\u03c8o i/ h\u03c8o |M2\u2020 M2 |\u03c8o i = \u03b1\u2032 |0i + \u03b2 \u2032 |1i, where \u03b1\u2032 =\np\np\n\u221a\n\u03b1/ 1 \u2212 |\u03b2|2 p and \u03b2 \u2032 = \u03b2 1 \u2212 p/ 1 \u2212 |\u03b2|2 p. To reverse\nthe effect of the weak measurement, i.e., to recover the\noriginal state |\u03c8o i from the state |\u03c8m i,\u0012we\n\u0013 to\n\u221a only need\n1\n\u2212\np\n0\n\u22121\n1\napply the inverse of M2 , M2 = \u221a1\u2212p\n, to\n0\n1\nthe state |\u03c8m i and the reversing operation M2\u22121 exists\nmathematically as long as the variable p, defined as the\npartial-collapse strength, is less than unity. (The normal\nprojection measurement corresponds to p = 1.)\nAssuming that M2 may be implemented for a photonic qubit, let us now examine how M2\u22121 can be re\u22121\nalized experimentally.\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 Since M2\u0013 \u0012can be\n\u0013 re-written as\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a\nM2\u22121 = \u221a1\u2212p\n\u2261 \u221a1\u2212p\nM2rev ,\n1 0\n0 1\u2212p\n1 0\nwe define the physical implementation of the reversing\noperation as M2rev , i.e., the sequence of a bit-flip operation, another weak measurement M2 , and a final bit\nflip operation. The probability of successful reversal will\nalways be less than unity and depend on the partialcollapse\nstrength p as M2rev does not include the constant\n\u221a\n1/ 1 \u2212 p.\nThe experimental setup to implement the weak measurement and the reversal operation for a photonic qubit\nis schematically shown in Fig. 1. The single-photon state\nnecessary for the implementation was prepared by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) [10, 11]. A\n405 nm cw multi-mode diode laser was used to pump a\n3 mm thick type-II BBO crystal to generate a pair of\ncollinearly propagating SPDC photons centered at 780\nnm (signal) and 842.4 nm (idler). The idler photon was\ndetected at a trigger detector (not shown in Fig. 1) and\nan 80 nm bandpass filter was used in front of the trigger\ndetector to reduce noise. When the trigger detector detects the idler photon, the signal photon is conditionally\nprepared in the single-photon state [10, 11]. The initial\nstate of the photonic qubit |\u03c8o i is then prepared by polarization encoding of the heralded single-photon state\nwith a set of half-wave and quarter-wave plates (WP).\nThe weak (or partial-collapse) measurement on the\nphotonic qubit is implemented by using an uncoated glass\nplate oriented at the Brewster angle (BP) and a singlephoton detector positioned at the reflected mode, see\nFig. 1. Since BP only reflects the vertical polarization\nstate, |1i, with a probability of reflection p, finding a\nsingle-photon in the reflected mode (identified by a click\nat the single-photon detector) is equivalent to subjecting\nthe photonic qubit to M1 measurement and this results\nin irreversible state collapse to the state |1i. For the weak\nmeasurement, M2 , we must consider the conjugate outcome in which the reflected mode of BP is not occupied\nby the single-photon (hence the single-photon detector\ndoes not click). The null event at the single-photon detector in the reflected mode of BP (dark port in Fig. 1)\nunambiguously signals that the single-photon found in\n\n\"Dark port\"\n\nWP\n\n\"Dark port\"\n\nBP\n\n|\u03c8o !\n\nBP\n\n|\u03c8m !\nHWP\n\nState\nPreparation\n\nWP\n\nPartial-Collapse\nMeasurement\n\nHWP\n\nReversing Operation\n\nP\nState\nTomography\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic of the experimental setup. The heralded single-photon state is used for encoding the polarization\nqubit |\u03c8o i with a set of quarter and half-wave plates (WP).\nThe partial-collapse measurement is implemented with a set\nof Brewster-angle glass plates (BP) and the partial-collapse\nstrength p is varied by increasing the number of BP's. The\nreversing operation requires two half-wave plates (HWP), in\naddition to the BP. Qubit state tomography is performed with\nWP and a polarizer (P).\n\nthe transmitted mode of BP has been subjected to the\nweak measurement M2 and the original state |\u03c8o i has\nbeen partially collapsed to |\u03c8m i.\nSince the scheme is implemented using the heralded\nsingle-photon state, there is no need to monitor the dark\nport in practice [12]. Recording the coincidence event\nbetween the trigger detector and the detector placed in\nthe transmitted mode of BP is sufficient to implement\nthe weak measurement M2 on the photonic qubit without\nany background noise. The partial-collapse strength p of\nthe weak measurement can be increased by stacking more\nBP's and, in the experiment, p is varied between 0.4 and\n0.9 [13]. The reversing operation M2rev is implemented\nwith two half-wave plates for the bit-flip operations and\na set of BP's for the weak measurement M2 whose partial\ncollapse strength p is identically set to the initial weak\nmeasurement.\nFinally, coincidences between the trigger and the signal detectors were recorded and the signal detector was\nequipped with a 12.5 nm bandpass filter centered at 780\nnm. To determine the state of the photonic qubit completely, quantum state tomography was performed to the\nheralded single photon state by making projection measurements in different measurement basis with WP and\na polarizer (P) [14].\nIn experiment, we tomographically analyzed the input\nstate |\u03c8o i, the partially-collapsed state |\u03c8m i, and the recovered state by sequentially adding the partial-collapse\nmeasurement and the reversing operation, corresponding\nto a specific partial-collapse strength p, to the experimental setup for state preparation. The experiment was\nthen repeated for a different value of p.\nTotal of 14 input states were experimentally tested\nand, in Fig. 2, the results of quantum state tomography for four \u221a\nimportant input states (|Hi, \u221a\n|V i, |Ai =\n(|Hi \u2212 |V i)/ 2, and |Li = (|Hi + i|V i)/ 2) are reported.

The experimental data represented on the Bloch sphere also show that the reversing operation M2rev restores the partially-collapsed state\n|\u03c8m i back to the original state |\u03c8o i quite faithfully: the\nfidelities (shown in the fourth row of Fig. 2) calculated\nbetween the recovered states and the input states are\nshown to be over 94% for all 14 input states and all the\npartial-collapse strength p tested in the experiment.\nThe quantum state tomography data shown in Fig. 2\nfor the four input states (|Hi, |Li, |V i, and |Ai) then\nallow us to completely characterize quantum operations\ninvolved in this experiment, namely the weak measurement M2 and the reversing operation M2rev [2]. The\nmatrix \u03c7, known as the quantum process tomography\n(QPT) matrix, completely characterizes the quantum operation and the QPT matrix \u03c7 was reconstructed experimentally from the experimentally reconstructed density\nmatrices for the input states, the first row in Fig. 2, and\nfor the recovered states, the third row in Fig. 2, using the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation process [15].\nIn Fig. 3(a), the QPT matrix \u03c7, in the Pauli matrix\nbasis (I, X, Y, Z), for both the weak measurement M2\nand the recovering operation M2rev together at partialcollapse strength p = 0.895 is shown. Since the reversing\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Quantum process tomography matrix \u03c7 for both\nthe partial-collapse measurement and the reversing operation\ntogether at partial-collapse strength p = 0.895. It is clear that\nthe quantum process due to the partial-collapse measurement\nand the reversing operation together is mainly of the identity\noperation acting on the qubit. (b) The fidelity of the quantum process is over 94% for all the partial-collapse strength p\ntested in the experiment.\n\noperation is supposed to completely (albeit probabilistically) recover the initial quantum state, the quantum\noperation involving both M2 and M2rev should ideally be\nan identity operation and the corresponding QPT matrix\nshould be peaked at (I, I) only for Re[\u03c7]. The experimental \u03c7 shown in Fig. 3(a) clearly confirms this prediction.\nTo have quantitative understanding on the performance of the reversing operation, we have determined the\nQPT matrices for both M2 and M2rev operations together\nfor a number of partial-collapse strength p and obtained\nthe reversing fidelity F = tr[\u03c7exp \u03c7ideal], defined as the\noverlap of the experimentally reconstructed QPT matrix\n\u03c7exp and the ideal one \u03c7ideal peaked at (I, I) only for\nRe[\u03c7ideal]. The result shown in Fig. 3(b) demonstrates\nthat the reversing operation functions quite well as designed: the fidelity of the quantum process is over 94%\nfor all partial-collapse strength tested in the experiment.\nLet us now discuss the experiment in the context of information gain via the weak measurement. The detector\noutput (click or no click) allows us to guess the initial\nstate of the quantum system, \u03c1G , and the quality of our\nguess can be quantified\nwith the estimation fidelity, deR\nfined as Gavg = h\u03c8o |\u03c1G |\u03c8o id\u03c8o [16, 17].\nFirst, consider the following guessing strategy: if the\ndetector clicks (i.e., M1 measurement occurs), we guess\nthe initial state as |1i and if there is no click at the detector (i.e., M2 measurement occurs), we guess that the\nqubit was more likely in the |0i state than in the |1i state\n[4, 5]. Therefore, our guess for the initial state of the\n\n\f4\nstate and, therefore, there is no information gain if the\nreversal operation is successful. In other words, the information gained via the weak measurement has been\nerased by the reversing operation.\n\nEstimation Fidelity Gavg\n\n0.65\n\n0.60\n\nGII\navg\n\nGIavg\n\n0.55\n\n0.50\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nPartial-Collapse Strength (p)\n\nFIG. 4: Information gain via the weak measurement (quantified as Gavg ) for the two guessing strategies discussed in\nthe text as functions of the partial-collapse strength p. The\nrandom guess and the projection measurement correspond to\np = 0 and p = 1, respectively. Solid lines are theory plots.\n\nqubit is \u03c1IG = P1 |1ih1| + P2 {p|0ih0| + (1 \u2212 p)|1ih1|}, where\np is the partial-collapse strength, P1 = h\u03c8o |M1\u2020 M1 |\u03c8o i =\np|\u03b2|2 , and P2 = h\u03c8o |M2\u2020 M2 |\u03c8o i = |\u03b1|2 + (1 \u2212 p)|\u03b2|2 . It\nis then straightforward to show that GIavg = (3 + p2 )/6.\nWhen no measurement is made (random guess; p = 0),\nGIavg = 1/2 and if p = 1 (projection measurement),\nGIavg = 2/3, as it should be for a qubit [16, 17].\nAlthough the above guessing strategy may look reasonable, it is not the optimal one. The optimal strategy is, in fact, to simply guess the initial state as |0i if\nthe detector does not click (M2 measurement). Formally\nspeaking, the optimal guessing strategy must choose the\neigenstate of a measurement operator associated with\nthe largest eigenvalue [16]. For the M2 operator, this\ncorresponds to the |0i state. The guessed state is then\n\u03c1II\nG = P1 |1ih1| + P2 |0ih0| and this leads to the estimation\nfidelity GII\navg = (3 + p)/6.\nIn Fig. 4, we show the estimation fidelities for both\nguessing strategies. The experimental estimation fidelities are obtained by evaluating h\u03c8o |\u03c1G |\u03c8o i from the experimental data for a set of initial states and then by\naveraging them [17]. Clearly, the second strategy offers a better estimation fidelity when the partial-collapse\nstrength does not correspond to the random guess (p = 0)\nand the projection measurement (p = 1).\nThe reversing operation then erases the information\ngained via the weak measurement. Since both the weak\nmeasurement and the reversing operation are successful\nonly when all the reflected modes of BP's in Fig. 1 are\nnot occupied by a photon,\n\u221a the overall operation can be\nwritten as M2rev M2 = 1 1 \u2212 p . Thus, the probability of\nsuccessful reversal is 1 \u2212 p regardless of the input state,\nindicating that the experimenter cannot learn anything\nabout the initial state from the success probability determined with an identically prepared ensemble of qubits.\nThe estimation fidelity in this case, obviously, is always\n1/2 which is equivalent to randomly guessing the input\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a linear optical\nimplementation of the weak (partial-collapse) quantum\nmeasurement and conditional (probabilistic) reversal of\nthe weak measurement for the photonic qubit. The quantum states and the involved quantum processes are quantitatively analyzed by using quantum state and process\ntomography techniques. Moreover, we have quantified\nand experimentally studied information gain due to the\nweak measurement and discussed the role of the reversing\noperation as an information erasure.\nYSK acknowledges the support of the Korea Research\nFoundation (KRF-2007-511-C00004).
