The subcycle regime is considered,\nand the delta function approximation is applied. The effects of the self force\nare also considered, and the threshold where radiation becomes important is\ndiscussed. A dimensionless parameter is defined that signals the onset of\nradiation reaction effects.\n\nVery short and even subcycle optical pulses have been gaining increasing\nattention in recent years.[1] The theory of the interaction of short pulses with\ncharged particles has been studied in [2], [3] in one dimension. In three dimensions\nthe subcycle problem becomes more complicated, and contentious [5]-[9], and it has\nalso been studied in plasmas.[10] Often, as the pulses decrease in their temporal\nspan, the intensity rises correspondingly. In fact, intensities of 1022 W cm\u22122 have\nbeen reached, and this number is expected to go even higher.[11] At such extreme\nconditions, the radiation reaction force should be examined, and we will examine the\nintensities and pulse durations where the onset of the self force becomes important.\nTo begin, a nonrelativistic approximation is used to assess the use of a delta\nfunction to model a short pulse. It is shown to be in agreement with the exact\nsolution of a Gaussian pulse, the approximation improving as the Gaussian pulse\nbecomes smaller. It is then shown how the delta approximation works for the\nrelativistic case, and finally, self force effects are considered.\n\u2217\n\nrhammond@email.unc.edu\n\n1\n\n\fFor a short pulse the slowly varying envelope approximation fails, and for a\nsubcycle pulse the whole notion of a wave train is derailed. Opposite the limit of a\nmonochromatic wave sits a delta function, and in the following we examine the\nusefulness of this, other extreme, approximation. The value of this approximation\nlies in the following observation. As the pulse becomes ever smaller, the exact pulse\nshape may not be known exactly, and furthermore, sometimes the detailed motion\nduring the fleeting moment of interaction is not of interest anyway, where the final\nvelocity and energy are of more interest.\nThe most drastic approximation to be made is the one dimensional model,\nmeaning that the pulse, or waveform is of the form f (z \u2212 ct), i.e., the plane wave\n\napproximation (although not necessarily a wave). Real pulses are focused down in a\nvariety of ways and, regardless of how they are made, the field is a function of all of\nthe coordinates. This has been discussed extensively in the references given above.\nNevertheless, there are times when the 1-D approximation is useful and sheds light\non the more exact physics. This is one of those cases, where we are able to examine\nboth the delta function approximation and self force effects with relative ease.\nFor example, consider Gaussian pulse. Non-dimensionalized units are used\nwhere z/L \u2192 z and ct/L \u2192 t, where L is taken to be of the order of the wavelength\nof visible light (for numerical calculations below L = 5, 000\u00c5), and the field is\n\npolarized in the x direction.\n2\n\nE = Ee\u2212((z\u2212t)/w) x\u0302\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w is a dimensionless parameter fixing the width of the pulse. This must be\naccompanied by a magnetic field\n2\n\nB = Ee\u2212((z\u2212t)/w) \u0177.\n\n(2)\n\nFor nonrelativistic dynamics one may ignore the magnetic field and integrate\nF = ma = qE, for a particle with charge q and mass m. It is helpful to define the\nimpulse by\nI=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221a\nF dt = qEwL \u03c0/c.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWith this, integrating the equation of motion yields\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fmv\nt\u2212z\n1\n1 + erf(\n=\n)\nI\n2\nw\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4)\n\nThis is plotted in Fig. 1 at z = 0 for different values of w.\nAs w gets small, we may think of the force on the particle as impulsive, and\nin fact, approximate the Gaussian by a delta function1 E = N\u03b4\nnormalization N is fixed by assuming\n\nwhich gives N =\n\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\n\u2212(z\u2212t)/w)2\n\nEe\n\ndt =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\nz\u2212t\nw\n\n\u0011\n\nx\u0302 where\n\nz\u2212t\ndt\nN\u03b4\nw\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c0E. This insures that the impulse is the same in each case. The\n\nvelocity is easily found. Assuming that the initial velocity is zero gives\nv=\n\nI\n\u03b8(t).\nm\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: mv/I vs t for w = 1, 1/2, 1/4, showing that the smaller w is, the more\nsteplike is the response.\nThis shows that replacing the Gaussian by a delta function reproduces the\nsolution of the equation of motion in the limit of a narrow pulse. In the limit that\nw \u2192 0 these results show that the Dirac approximation precisely coincides with the\n\nexact result given by the Gaussian approximation. In reality, short pulses have a\ncomplicated profile, but these results show the advantage of the delta function\napproach: It changes the problem from solving a differential equation to an\nalgebraic equation.\nTo consider the relativistic situation consider the equation of motion\n1\n\nSince this is a function of z \u2212 t it satisfies the wave equation, which also follows from the fact\nz\u2212t\nthat \u03b4( z\u2212t\nw ),z = \u2212\u03b4( w ),t\n\n3\n\n\fdv \u03c3\nq \u03c3\u03bd\n=\nF v\u03bd .\nd\u03c4\nmc\n\n(7)\n\nWe consider an electromagnetic wave of the form\nE = Ef (z \u2212 t)x\u0302\n\n(8)\n\nB = Ef (z \u2212 t)\u0177.\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\nThis represents a plane wave of amplitude E, polarized in the x direction, described\nby any dimensionless function f . With this (7) gives,\ndv 0\n= af v 1\nd\u03c4\n\n(10)\n\ndv 1\n= af (v 0 \u2212 v 3 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(11)\n\ndv 2\n=0\nd\u03c4\n\n(12)\n\ndv 3\n= af v 1\nd\u03c4\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the dimensionless parameter a = eLE/(mc2 ).\nAs these equations stand, the delta function approximation fails. This is\nbecause, since the velocity is like a step function function, the integral of (13), for\nexample, is difficult to assess.2 A better way to proceed is to note that (10) and (13)\nimply,\nv0 = 1 + v3\n\n(14)\n\ndv 0\n= af v 1\nd\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\nwhich leaves the pair\n\n2\n\nFor example,\nas well.\n\nR\n\n\u03b8(t)\u03b4(t) = 1/2. Since v 1 is not exactly a step function, this result is inapplicable\n\n4\n\n\fdv 1\n= af.\nd\u03c4\n\n(16)\n\nv 0 = 1 + (v 1 )2 /2.\n\n(17)\n\nThese imply,\n\nUsing the integral of (14) in the right hand side of (16) yields\nv1 = a\n\nZ\n\nf (\u2212\u03c4 )d\u03c4,\n\n(18)\n\na fascinating result. It states that the x component of the four velocity is essentially\nequal to the nonrelativistic three velocity evaluated at the proper time \u03c4 . With this,\n(14), and (17), the relativistic solution is completely determined in terms of the\nnonrelativistic solution for an arbitray 1D wave form f (z \u2212 t).\n\nFor example, the delta function approximation may be used in (18). With\n\u221a\nthe integral of (14), and letting f \u2192 \u03c0\u03b4, we find\n\u221a\nv 1 = a \u03c0\u03b8(\u03c4 )\n\nv 3 = \u03c0a2 /2\u03b8(\u03c4 )\n\nv 0 = 1 + \u03c0a2 /2\u03b8(\u03c4 ).\n\n(19)\n\nIt is easy to see that this agrees with the asymptotic form of the analytical solution,\n\u221a\na \u03c0\n(1 + erf(\u03c4 )),\nv (\u03c4 ) =\n2\n1\n\n(20)\n\nand the other components are found by simple alegra. For example, for an intensity\nof 1018 W cm\u22122 , which corresponds to a = \u22122.7, the exact analytical solutions are\n\nplotted in Fig. 2. The asymptotic region is seen to agree with the delta function\napproximation.\n\nAnother useful observation from (19) is that for high intensity, v 3 \u2248 v 0 . In\n\nparticular this is valid for a >> 1. For example, at I = 1019 W cm\u22122 the difference\nbetween v 3 and v 0 is less than one percent.\nOne may also solve (17) with (20) for the time t in terms of the proper time \u03c4 ,\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n\n1\ne\u2212\u03c4\nt = a2 \u03c0 \uf8ed\u03c4 erf(\u03c4 )2 + 2 \u03c4 + \u221a\n8\n\u03c0\nwhich is used in Fig. 3.\n\n!\n\nerf(\u03c4 ) + \u03c4 \u2212\n\ns\n\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2 \u0010\u221a \u0011 2e\u2212\u03c4 \uf8f8\nerf 2\u03c4 + \u221a\n,\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\n\f10\n\nv1\nv3\nv0\n\n5\n\n-3 -2 -1\n-5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: The asymptotic regions agress with the delta function approximation, for\nv vs. t.\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n-5\nFigure 3: The x and z components of the four velocity versus t.\nHaving an analytical expression for the velocity is useful for looking at the\nself force. The equation of motion with radiation reaction forces is\n\n3\n\ndv \u03c3\n= af \u03c3\u03bc v\u03bc + b(v\u0308 \u03c3 + v\u0307 \u03bd v\u0307\u03bd v \u03c3 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the dimensionless parameter b \u2261 c\u03c40 /L, \u03c40 = 2q 2 /(3mc3 ) and the overdots\n\nimply differentiation with respect to the proper time. This is called the Lorentz\n\nAbraham Dirac equation, but the other form of the equation of motion is obtained\nby starting with (22) but using\ndv \u03c3\n= af \u03c3\u03bc v\u03bc\nd\u03c4\n\n(23)\n\nin the terms multiplied by b, which leads to,\n3\n\nWe assume v\u03c3 v \u03c3 = 1. In the literature, some take v\u03c3 v \u03c3 = \u22121, which changes signs in the self\nforce.\n\n\fdv \u03c3\n= af \u03c3\u03bc v\u03bc + abf \u0307\u03c3\u03bc v\u03bc + a2 b(f \u03c3\u03b3 f\u03b3 \u03c6 v\u03c6 + f \u03bd\u03b3 v\u03b3 f\u03bd \u03c6 v\u03c6 v \u03c3 ),\nd\u03c4\n\n(24)\n\nwhich is called the Landau Lifshitz Rohrlich equation. The LAD equation fell under\nbad times to the the runaway solutions, preaceleration issues, or the apparent need\nto invoke non-zero size particles,[12] while the LLR equations seems to be only an\napproximation. For a nice introduction to the issues, with historical notes, one may\nconsult Rohrlich[13], which has many of the seminal references and discusses the\ndistinction between \"self forces\" and \"radiation reaction forces.\" More recent work\nconsiders the problem in various dimensions,[14][15] the effect of the magnetic\ndipole,[16][17], connections to QED[18] and vacuum polarization,[20], mass\nconversion[19], and hydrogenic orbits.[21]\nWhenever b is small, which is true for all but the most extreme light, it is\nsensible to expand the solution in terms of this parameter,\nv \u03c3 = 0 v\u03c3 + 1 v \u03c3 + ...\n\n(25)\n\nwhere 0 v \u03c3 is the solution without self forces, 1 v \u03c3 is O(b), and so on. Then, for the\nplane polarized field used above we have,\n\nd1 v 0\n= af 1 v1 + g 0 (0 v) + O(b2 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(26)\n\nd1 v 1\n= af (1 v 0 \u2212 1 v 3 ) + g 1 (0 v) + O(b2 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(27)\n\nd1 v 3\n= af 1 v 1 + g 3 (0 v) + O(b2 ).\nd\u03c4\n\n(28)\n\nwhere g \u03c3 represents the self force, and where 0 v \u03c3 is known, given by (18), (14), and\n(17). These equations show that v\u0307 0 = v\u0307 3 + O(b2 ), a very useful result, which allows\n\nus to use v 0 \u2212 1 = v 3 in the O(b) equations. With this, we have, calling \u03c6 \u2261 0 v 1 and\ndropping the subscripts, to O(b)\n\ndv 0\n= af v 1 + ab(\u03c6f \u0307 \u2212 af 2 \u03c62 /2)\nd\u03c4\nand\n\n(29)\n\n\fdv 1\n= af + ab(f \u0307 \u2212 a\u03c6f 2 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(30)\n\nIt is noteworthy that these equations are obtained by using either the LAD\nor the LLR form for the self force. We use\n2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212((z\u2212t)/w)\ne\u2212(\u03c4 /w)\nf=\n\u2192\n,\nw\nw\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the last part holds to O(b2 ). One can see that the self forces become\n\u221a\nimportant as r \u2261 a2 b \u03c0/w \u2192 1. We examine this, and the accuracy of the\n\napproximations, for specificic cases. For an intensity of 1023 W cm\u22122 (a \u223c \u2212850) and\n\nw = 100, b \u223c 0.5, the velocities are given in Figs. 4 and 5. It is seen explicitly, as we\nexpect, the effect of the radiation reaction is to reduce the final velocity of the\n\nparticle. If the intensity is increased by one order of magnitude, so does r, and the\nresults diverge drastically, as expected.4\nAs a final example let us consider a pulse of soft x-rays, where we take\n2\n\ne\u2212((z\u2212t)/w)\nf=\ncos(\u03a9(z \u2212 t))\nw\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the dimensionless \u03a9 determines the frequency. In this case the delta\napproximation is invalid, but the expansion in terms of b is still useful. To zero\norder in b we have,\n1 \u2212 1 w 2 \u03a92 \u221a\niw\u03a9\nx iw\u03a9\nx\n1\n+ erf\n\u2212\n+\n\u03c0 erf\n0 v = ae 4\n4\nw\n2\nw\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThis of course is real, which is seen directly by writing the error function in terms of\nthe imaginary error function. Before considering x-rays it is interesting to consider\nthe case that \u03a9 = 1 = w at 1023 W cm\u22122 . This is just below the radiation reaction\n\"threshold,\" but it is interesting to see how strongly relativisitic the solution is.\nThis is evident in Figs. 6 and 7, which show the four velocity as a function of proper\ntime and the corresponding velocity (dz/dt) versus t.\nFor soft x-rays \u03a9 \u223c 100 (50\u00c5 radiation) and we take w = 1/10 (\u223c 200as\n\npulse). The results are plotted in Figs. 8 and 9 for I = 5 \u00d7 1023 W cm\u22122 .\n4\n\nAs a partial check on the numerical work, which was accomplished using Mathematica, v\u03c3 v \u03c3\nwas plotted, a result not used explicitly in the calculations. The value was always within a tenth of\none percent of unity.\n\n8\n\n\f-3 -2 -1\n\n1 2 3\n\n500000\nb=0\n\n-1000\n\norder b\nnumerical\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 4: v0 plotted against 100t with no radiation reaction, as a solution to (29) and\n(30), and a numerical solution to the exact\nequations 24.\n\nFigure 5: v1\n\n1\n3000\n\n2000\n0.5\n1000\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nFigure 6: vz plotted against the proper time Figure 7: dz/dt vs. t, corrsponding to Fig.\nfor I = 1023 W cm\u22122 .\n6.\n\n150\n100\n50\n\n15000\n10000\n\n-0.15-0.1-0.05\n-50\n-100\n-150\n\n5000\n\n-0.15-0.1-0.05\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15\n\nFigure 8: v0 plotted against 10t with no radiation reaction, as a solution to (29) and\n(30), and a numerical solution to the exact\nequations 24.\n\n9\n\nFigure 9: v1\n\n\fIn order to assess the vailidty of the approximations we may start with the\nequations, for any pulse of form considered above,\ndv 0\n= a(f + bf \u0307)v 1 + a2 bf 2 (v 0 + v 3 \u2212 Z 2 v 0 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(34)\n\ndv 1\n= a(f + bf \u0307)Z \u2212 ba2 f 2 Z 2 v 1\nd\u03c4\n\n(35)\n\ndv 3\n= a(f + bf \u0307)v 1 + ba2 f 2 (v 0 + v 3 \u2212 Z 2 v 3 )\nd\u03c4\n\n(36)\n\nwhere Z = v 0 \u2212 v 3 .

Since the integral is\nbounded, Z \u2248 1 for small b. We can use this to investigate a self consistent solution\n\nto this equation by using the Z = 1 (which implies t \u2212 z = \u03c4 ) in f to find\nZ\n\n\u22122\n\n2\n\n= 1 + ba w\n\nr\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u03c0\u0010\n1 + erf( 2\u03c4 /w) .\n2\n\nThis shows that the approximation Z = 1 is valid as long as ba2 w\n\n(38)\nq\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n<< 1.\n\nIn summary, it has been shown that the delta function approximation is\napplicable for both the relativistic and non-relativistic case for any incident traveling\nwave of the form f (z \u2212 t). For the relativistic case, it is shown how an exact\n\nsolution may be found, and these results are used in the investigation of self forces.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A. E. Kaplan, S F.
