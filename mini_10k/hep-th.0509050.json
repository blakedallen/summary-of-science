Nevertheless, this framework\nis appropriate for describing interactionsp\nat energies and\nmomenta below the Planck scale MP \u2261 ~c/GNewton \u2248\n1.4\u00d71019 GeV/c2 when treated as an effective low-energy\ntheory. Indeed, if one makes subtractions to normalize\nphysical couplings at an energy scale E0 well below MP\nin such a way as to enforce the Einstein-Hilbert action of\nPSfrag\ngeneral relativity at the classical level with minimal couplings and a vanishing (or very small) cosmological term,\nthen quantum corrections to this classical action at scale\nE will occur with coefficients containing positive powers\nof (E \u2212 E0 )/MP , a small number. That procedure is the\nimplicit foundation for practical use of classical general\nrelativity as a model of nature despite the existence of\nquantum mechanics. It therefore underlies an enormous\nrange of successful physical and astrophysical applications. Only the classical theory really comes into play in\nthose applications, because the quantum corrections are\nquantitatively small. Thus, the conceptual framework\nof effective field theory provides a sophisticated rationalization for proceeding naively in applying the classical\ntheory.\nStill, as Donoghue has emphasized [5], calculating corrections to the classical theory is a problem of methodological interest. Moreover, quantitative considerations\nconcerning interactions at ultra-high energy scales, perhaps approaching the Planck scale, are important in assessing the possibility of gauge theory coupling unification [6, 7]. Also, the size of gravitational corrections, in\ncomparison to the leading classical term, give an objective indication for the characteristic scale for the onset\nof quantum gravity phenomenology. With these motivations, we consider here the one-loop (that is, first nontrivial order in perturbation theory) gravitational correction to running of gauge theory couplings.\nWe will perform this calculation directly in the framework described above. Any would-be fundamental theory\nof quantum gravity should reproduce the same result in\nthe limit of the physical scenario considered here, which\nis bosonic gravity in a four dimensional Minkowski back-\n\n\u261b\n\u261b\u2701\n\u2721\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\n\u2701\n\u261b\n\u2721\u2701\n\u2721\ng \u2713\n\u0004 \u270f\n\u2713\n\u2702\u2701 \u2704\u2702\u2701 \u270f\n\u2713\n\u2704\u2702\u2701 \u270f\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2713\n\u2704\u2702\u2701 \u270f\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2713\n\u2704\u2702\u2701 \u270f\n\u2190E\nE\n\u2702\u2701\nE\n\u2708\n\u2704\u2702\u2708\u2701 M\u270f\np\nMp\u2713\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2713\n\u2704\n\u270f\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2702\n\u2701\n\u2713\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2702\u2704\u2701 \u2704\u270f\nreplacements \u2713\n\u2702\u2701\n\u2702\u2701 \u270f\n\nFIG. 1: A typical Feynman diagram for a gravitational process contributing to the renormalization of a gauge coupling\nat one-loop. Curly lines represent gluons. Double lines represent gravitons. The three-gluon vertex \u0004 is proportional to g,\nwhile the gluon-graviton vertex \u2022 is proportional to E/MP .\n\nground, with general matter and gauge sectors, at energies below the Plank scale. Related calculations have\nbeen done in string theory [8, 9], but this brings in several\nadditional structures simultaneously, and we have found\nthe results difficult to compare.\nForm of the correction.-The character of the correction can be determined on very general grounds.\nThe one-loop Feynman diagrams of interest involve a\ngluon vertex dressed by graviton exchange (See Fig. 1).\nAlternatively, one could calculate the running coupling of\na gluon to a test \"matter\" field. Gauge invariance (i.e.,\nuniversality of the gauge coupling) implies that the same\nresult must be obtained. This consideration highlights a\ncancellation between vertex and wave function renormalization, guaranteed by Ward identities, as is familiar in\nQED.\nSince the gauge boson vertex has strength g and gravitons couple to energy-momentum with a dimensional\ncoupling \u221d 1/MP, dimensional analysis implies that the\nrunning of couplings in four dimensions will be governed\nby a Callan-Symanzik \u03b2 function of the form\n\u03b2(g, E) \u2261\n\nE2\nb0 3\ndg\ng,\ng + a0\n=\u2212\n2\nd ln E\n(4\u03c0)\nMP 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the first term includes the familiar non-\n\n\f2\ngravitational contribution, and the second term includes\nthe gravitational contribution. Since gravitons carry no\ngauge charge, b0 has the same value it had in the absence\nof gravitation, as determined by the matter content and\nthe gauge group. Detailed calculation is required to determine the numerical value of the coefficient a0 .\nEven before knowing the value of a0 , much phenomenology can be extracted from the form of Eq. (1).\nThe equation can be integrated to yield\ne a0 E\n\n2\n\n/MP 2\n\n2\n(4\u03c0)2\na0 E02 /MP 2 (4\u03c0)\n\u2212\ne\ng(E)2\ng(E0 )2\nZ E2\n2 dy\n= b0\nea0 y/MP\n. (2)\n2\ny\nE0\n\nThis reduces, of course, to the familiar logarithmic running of inverse couplings in the limit a0 \u2192 0 (or MP \u2192\n\u221e). Corrections to the familiar result will be very small\nfor E, E0 \u226a MP .\nThe value of a0 is manifestly independent of the gauge\ninteraction involved. So, if we consider several gauge\ncouplings g i , with different bi0 , the condition that they\nunify at a common value g(EU ) is\n(4\u03c0)2\ngi (E0 )2\nbj0\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n(4\u03c0)2\ngj (E0 )2\nbi0\n\n=e\n\n\u2212a0 E02 /MP 2\n\nZ\n\n2\nEU\n\nea0 y/MP\n\nE02\n\n2\n\ndy\ny\n\n(3)\n\nfor all choices of i and j. In particular, the left-hand\nside of Eq. (3) must be independent of the choice of i, j.\nSince that combination of initial couplings and renormalization group coefficients is not affected by the gravitational correction, the unification constraints remain unchanged. However, the scale of unification and the value\nof the common coupling at unification do change, as we\nshall now discuss.\nComparing the unification condition with and without\nthe gravitational correction, and taking E02 /MP 2 \u2192 0, we\nsee that the relationship between the uncorrected unification energy E\u2217 and the corrected unification energy EU\nis\n2\n+ a0\nln E\u22172 = ln EU\n\n2\nEU\n.\nMP 2\n\nIf E\u2217 \u226a MP , the self-consistent correction is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE\u22172\n2\n2\n.\nEU \u2248 E\u2217 1 \u2212 a0\nMP 2\n\n(4)\n\nThe value of the coupling at unification is modified\naccording to\n2\n\nea0 EU /MP\n\n2\n\n1\n1\n=\n,\ng(EU )2\ng\u2217 (E\u2217 )2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere g\u2217 is the running coupling as determined by Eq.\n(1) with a0 \u2192 0.

We\ndocument algebraic details elsewhere [10]; here we just\nsketch our method and conventions.\nThe dynamics for a non-Abelian gauge field coupled\nto gravity in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions is given by the\naction\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\n1 ac bd a a\n4 \u221a\nS[g, A] = d x \u2212g 2 R \u2212 2 g g Fab Fcd , (8)\n\u03ba\n4g\nwhere g = det gab , gab is the spacetime metric, \u03ba2 =\n16\u03c0/MP2 , R is the Ricci scalar, g is the gauge coupling,\na\nc\nFab\n\u2261 \u2206a Aab \u2212 \u2206b Aaa + f abc Ab\na Ab\n\n(9)\n\nis the field strength, Aaa is the gauge field, f abc are the\nstructure constants of the non-Abelian gauge group G,\nand \u2206a is the spacetime covariant derivative operator.\na\nSince Fab\nis antisymmetric under a \u2194 b, the Christoffel\nconnections arising from the derivatives in Equation (9)\ncancel against each other, so the covariant derivatives\nhere can be replaced with ordinary derivatives.\nWe apply the background field method because it is\nespecially well suited to the specific problem at hand in\nways that we will highlight throughout this section. In\naccordance with this method, we seek to evaluate the\neffective action for classical field configurations by integrating over quantum fluctuations hab and Aaa :\nZ\neiSeff [g,a] = DhDAeiS[g,A] .\n(10)\nHere, we have expanded gab as a quantum fluctuation\nhab about a background gab ,\n\n(5)\n\nIn standard (quasiminimal) unification schemes we find\nthat E\u2217 is smaller than MP by roughly 3 orders of magnitude, so this approximation is appropriate, but the correction itself is of no practical importance. On the other\nhand, it is widely viewed as disturbing to have the separation of scales E\u2217 \u226a MP . Theories that address this issue will inevitably bring in the gravitational correction-\nwhich, if a0 happens to be negative, helps to close the\ngap.\n\ngab = gab + hab ,\n\n(11)\n\nand likewise expanded Aaa as a fluctuation Aaa about a\nbackground aaa ,\nAaa = aaa + Aaa .\n\n(12)\n\nIn principle, the classical fields gab and aaa could satisfy\nthe classical equations of motion, the coupled EinsteinYang-Mills equations. For our purposes, however-that\nis, calculating the renormalization of gauge couplings to\none-loop order in perturbation theory-it suffices to set\n\n\f3\ngab equal to the flat Minkowski metric while allowing aaa\nto obey the flat-space Yang-Mills equations of motion.\nWe expand the action (8) in terms of these backgrounds\nand fluctuations up to quadratic order in the quantum\nfields, since within the background field method, higherorder terms in the action will only contribute to higherloop processes.\nIf we couple any matter to this system, we do not\nexpand the matter fields as fluctuations about a background because we are only interested in the renormalization of the gauge coupling. We still keep terms up to\nonly quadratic order in quantum fields, however. Since\nwe are expanding about Minkowski spacetime, matter\nterms in the action will give exactly the same contribution to the one-loop renormalized coupling that they did\nin the absence of gravitation.\nThe action (8) is invariant under diffeomorphisms\n\u03b4\u03b7 hab =\u2202a \u03b7b + \u2202b \u03b7a + \u2202a \u03b7 c hcb + \u2202b \u03b7 c hca + \u03b7 c \u2202c hab ,\n(13a)\n\u03b4\u03b7 Aaa\n\u03b4\u03b7 aaa\n\n=Aac \u2202a \u03b7 c + \u03b7 c \u2202c Aaa ,\n=aac \u2202a \u03b7 c + \u03b7 c \u2202c aaa ;\n\n(13b)\n(13c)\n\nand under gauge transformations of the group G\nc\n\u03b4\u03b1 Aaa =Da \u03b1a + f abc Ab\na\u03b1 ,\n\u03b4\u03b1 hab =0.\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n\n(Here, Da = \u2202a \u2212 iaaa tar when acting on representation r,\nand indices are raised and lowered with the background\nMinkowski metric.) These gauge symmetries need to\nfixed before performing the functional integration (10).\nWe take the background-covariant gauge-fixing conditions\nGa (A) \u2261Da Aaa = 0,\nC\u0303 a (h, A) \u2261C a (h) \u2212\n\n(15)\n\n\u03ba2 aab a\nF Ab = 0,\ng2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\nC a (h) \u2261 \u2202b hab \u2212 21 \u2202 a h\n\n(h \u2261 haa ),\n\n(17)\n\na\nand Fab\nis the appropriate function of classical fields only.\nEquation (16) is similar to an R\u03be gauge [11]. Here it\nis engineered to cancel unpleasant graviton-gluon crossterms that would otherwise appear in the expansion. Using the Faddeev-Popov method [12] in conjunction with\nFeynman-'t Hooft weighting factors, the gauge choices\neach add gauge-fixing terms to the action as well as\ncorresponding ghost fields. The ghost fields will not\nbe expanded about a background and always appear at\nquadratic order in the action. So, like matter fields, the\nghost fields contribute to the renormalized gauge couplings exactly as they do in the absence of gravitation.\nIn particular, this means that the diffeomorphism ghost\n\ndoes not contribute at all and can be ignored in this background field calculation.\nNot all gluon-graviton cross terms in the action can\nbe eliminated by the choice of gauge (16) because gluongraviton mixing in a vector background is a real physical effect. In order to evaluate the Gaussian integrals in\nEq. (10) as functional determinants, we formally combine\nhab and Aaa into a \"superfield\" such that the mixing terms\nappear in the off-diagonal entries of the functional matrix\nin question. If multiple gauge symmetries are present,\neach with its own gauge field and renormalizable coupling, the superfield must be expanded to include each\ngluon type, as well as the graviton. The functional matrix then contains cross terms that mix different gluon\ntypes, but these do not ultimately contribute to the calculation at one-loop order. So, to this order, each gauge\ncoupling gets renormalized independently.\nResult.-At this point the Gaussian integrals over the\nquantum fields in Eq. (10) are formally defined, but the\nresulting functional determinants contain ultraviolet divergences. We subtract them at a reference energy E0 .\nWe find the one-loop effective action at energy scale E is\n\u0014\nZ\n\u03ba2 3\n1\n1\n4\n(E 2 \u2212 E02 )\nd x 2+ 2\nSeff [g, a] \u2248 \u2212\n4\ng\ng (4\u03c0)2\n\u0015\nb0\nE2\na aab\n+\nFab\nF , (18)\nln\n(4\u03c0)2 E02\nwhere b0 depends on the gauge and matter content independently of whether gravitation is included in the calculation.

(5) and (7) is valid, so\nthe negative sign of a0 slightly increases EU and slightly\nweakens the value of the unified coupling. This helps to\nclose the gap between the unification scale and the Plank\nscale.\nGravitational corrections will cause gauge couplings to\nrun even in theories that in themselves are exactly conformal invariant, that is when b0 = 0. Two notable examples in four dimensions are pure U (1) electromagnetism\nand N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills [13, 14, 15]. For these theories, the exponential integral in Equation (2) has zero\ncoefficient, so we are left with\ne\u2212a0 E\n\n2\n\n/MP 2 2\n\ng (E) = constant\n\n(20)\n\n\f4\nbeyond the Planck scale, rendering the gauge sector approximately free at these energies. In Fig. 2, we illustrate some aspects of the preceding discussion pictorially for an example theory with three gauge couplings\nwhose low-energy values are chosen such that the bi0 determined from the matter sector result in a unification\nat EU = 1016 GeV. Obviously such a theory mimics the\nminimally supersymmetric standard model.\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\ng(E)\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nlog10 (E/GeV)\nFIG. 2:\nWhen gravity is ignored, the three gauge couplings of a model theory evolve as the inverse logarithm of\nE at one-loop order (dashed curves). Initial values at 100\nGeV were set so that the curves exactly intersect at approximately 1016 GeV. When gravity is included at one-loop (solid\ncurves), the couplings remain unified near 1016 GeV, but\nevolve rapidly towards weaker coupling at high E.\n\nSPR thanks Ted Baltz for useful discussions.

For the pure\nU (1) case, this Gaussian running represents the renormalized coupling strength of photons to non-dynamical\nor heavy sources, and would be the dominant-but still\nnegligible-source of running in QED far below electronpositron threshold. For the theoretical \"application\" of\nEq. (20) to N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills, and in the context\nof unification, it would be logical to include the contribution of gravitino-gluino loops to a0 , but we have not\ncalculated that here.\nThe negative sign of a0 also signifies that the gravitational correction works in the direction of asymptotic\nfreedom: it causes the couplings to decrease at large energy. Of course, its effect only becomes quantitatively\nimportant when the energy approaches the Planck scale,\nand soon after that one loses the right to neglect higherorder graviton exchanges. Though neglect of additional\ncorrections is not justified beyond E \u226a MP , it is entertaining to consider some consequences of extrapolating\nEq. (2) as it stands to these energies, taking into account\na0 < 0. The integral on the right-hand side converges\nas E \u2192 \u221e, and so Eqn. (20) arises as an asymptotic\nrelation. Thus, the effective coupling vanishes rapidly\n\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nElectronic address: spatrick@mit.edu\nElectronic address: wilczek@mit.edu\nG.
