The\nspecific heat coefficient \u03b3 = C\nT increases steeply near 11\nkbar and retains a large and nearly constant value [6].\nThe ferromagnets ZrZn2 and U RhGe are superconducting at ambient pressure with superconducting critical temperatures Tsc = 0.29K and Tsc = 0.25K respectively. ZrZn2 is ferromagnetic below the Curie temperature Tc = 28.5K with low-temperature ordered moment of \u03bcs = 0.17\u03bcB per formula unit, while for U RhGe\nTc = 9.5K and \u03bcs = 0.42\u03bcB . The low Curie temperatures and small ordered moments indicate that compounds are close to a ferromagnetic quantum critical\npoint. A large jump in the specific heat, at the temperature where the resistivity becomes zero, is observed\nin U RhGe. At low temperature the specific heat coefficient \u03b3 is twice smaller than in the ferromagnetic phase.\nmaterials\nThe most popular theory of FM-superconductivity is\nbased on the paramagnon exchange mechanism [7,8].\nThe order parameters are spin parallel components of the\nspin triplet. The superconductivity in ZrZn2 was predicted, but the theory meets many difficulties. In order\nto explain the absence of superconductivity in paramagnetic phase it was accounted for the magnon paramagnon interaction and proved that the critical temperature is much higher in the ferromagnetic phase than\nin the paramagnetic one [9]. To the same purpose, the\nGinzburg-Landau mean-field theory was modified with\nan exchange-type interaction between the magnetic moments of triplet-state Cooper pairs and the ferromagnetic\nmagnetization density [10].\nThe Fay and Appel (FA) theory predicts that spin up\nand spin down fermions form Cooper pairs, and hence\nthe specific heat decreases exponentially at low temperature. The phenomenological theories [11] circumvent\nthe problem assuming that only majority spin fermions\nform pairs, and hence the minority spin fermions contribute the asymptotic of the specific heat. The coefficient \u03b3 = C\nT is twice smaller in the superconducting phase, which closely matches the experiments with\nU RhGe [3] but does not resemble the experimental results for U Ge2 and ZrZn2 . The assumption seems to be\ndoubtful for systems with very small ordered moment.\nThe superconducting critical temperature in (FA) theory increases when the magnetization decreases and very\nclose to the quantum critical point falls down rapidly. It\nhas recently been the subject of controversial debate. It is\nobtained in [12], by means of a more complete Eliashberg\ntreatment, that the transition temperature is nonzero at\nthe critical point.

It is shown that in the presence of\nan external magnetic field the system undergoes a first order\nquantum phase transition.\n74.20.Mn, 75.50.Cc,75.10.Lp\n\nI Introduction\nVery recently ferromagnetic superconductivity (FMsuperconductivity) has been observed in U Ge2 [1],\nZrZn2 [2] and U RhGe [3]. The superconductivity is\nconfined to the ferromagnetic phase. Ferromagnetism\nand superconductivity are believed to arise due to the\nsame band electrons. The persistence of ferromagnetic\norder within the superconducting phase has been ascertained by neutron scattering. The specific heat anomaly\nassociated with the superconducting transition in these\nmaterials appears to be absent.\nAt ambient pressure U Ge2 is an itinerant ferromagnet below the Curie temperature Tc = 52K, with lowtemperature ordered moment of \u03bcs = 1.4\u03bcB /U . With\nincreasing pressure the system passes through two successive quantum phase transition, from ferromagnetism\nto FM-superconductivity at P \u223c 10 kbar, and at higher\npressure Pc \u223c 16 kbar to paramagnetism [1,4]. At the\npressure where the superconducting transition temperature is a maximum Tsc = 0.8K, the ferromagnetic state\nis still stable with Tc = 32K, and the system undergoes\n\n1\n\n\fshown that the reduction of quasiparticle coherence and\nlife-time due to spin fluctuations is the pair-breaking process which leads to a rapid reduction of the superconducting critical temperature near the quantum critical point.\nRecent studies of polycrystalline samples of U Ge2 show\nthat T-P phase diagram is very similar to those of singlecrystal specimens of U Ge2 [14]. These findings suggest\nthat the superconductivity in U Ge2 is relatively insensitive to the presence of impurities and defects which excludes the spin parallel pairing.\nDespite of the efforts, the improved theory of paramagnon induced superconductivity can not cover the whole\nvariety of properties of FM-superconductivity.\nMagnon exchange mechanism of superconductivity has\nbeen proposed [15] to explain in a natural way the fact\nthat the superconductivity in U Ge2 , ZrZn2 and U RhGe\nis confined to the ferromagnetic phase.The order parameter is a spin anti-parallel component \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191 of a spin-1\ntriplet (\u2191\u2191, \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191, \u2193\u2193) with zero spin projection. The\ntransverse spin fluctuations are pair forming and the longitudinal ones are pair breaking. The competition between magnons and paramagnons explains the existence\nof the two successive quantum phase transitions in U Ge2 .\nAn itinerant system is considered in which the spin- 21\nfermions responsible for the ferromagnetism are the same\nquasiparticles which form the Cooper pairs. Hence, one\nhas to consider the equation for the gap as well as the\nequation for the magnetization. Then the system of equations for the gap and for the magnetization determines\nthe phase where the superconductivity and the ferromagnetism coexist.\nIn the present paper, a superconducting solution,\nbased on the magnon exchange mechanism, is obtained\nwhich closely matches the experiments with ZrZn2 and\nU RhGe. The proposed superconducting solution differs\nfrom the superconducting solution discussed in [15] in\ntwo ways. First, the quantum phase transition from ferromagnetism to FM-superconductivity is smooth second\norder phase transition, which resembles the experimental\nresults for U Ge2 . In the present paper, the system passes\ntrough a first order quantum phase transition. Second, to\nform a Cooper pair an electron transfers from one Fermi\nsurface to the other. As a result, the onset of superconductivity in [15] leads to the appearance of two Fermi\nsurfaces in each of the spin up and spin down momentum\ndistribution functions. The existence of the two Fermi\nsurfaces explains the linear dependence of the specific\nheat at low temperatures as opposed to the exponential\ndecrease of the specific heat in the BCS theory. In the ferromagnetic phase the specific heat constant \u03b3 is smaller\nthan in the superconducting one, which closely matches\nthe experiments with U Ge2 [6]. The onset of superconductivity, in the preset paper, leads to the appearance\nof complicated Fermi surfaces in the spin up and spin\ndown momentum distribution functions. Each of them\nconsist of two pieces, but they are simple-connected and\ncan be made very small by varying the microscopic parameters. As a result, \u03b3 = C\nT can be made smaller in\n\nFM-superconducting phase in agreement with U RhGe\nexperiments [3].\nThe existence of two Fermi surfaces in each of the spinup and spin-down momentum distribution functions is\na generic property of a FM-superconductivity with spin\nanti-parallel pairing. An important example is the coexistence of ferromagnetism and s-superconductivity induced by phonons [16]. The spin fluctuations are pair\nbreaking if the order parameter is spin singlet [17], and\nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism coexist if the spin\nfluctuations are weak, while the magnon-induced superconductivity coexist with ferromagnetism close to quantum critical point where the spin fluctuations are very\nstrong. The present paper and [16] describe different\nphysical realities which lead to coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II an effective Hamiltonian is obtained. In Sec III, the magnoninduced superconductivity is discussed. The superconducting solution known from [15] is reported to complete\nthe investigation. Section IV is devoted to the concluding\nremarks.\nII Effective Hamiltonian\nAn itinerant system is considered in which the spinfermions responsible for the ferromagnetism are the\nsame quasiparticles which form the Cooper pairs.

After some algebra one obtains an effective\nfour fermion theory which can be written as a sum of\nfour terms. Three of them describe the interaction of the\ncomponents of spin-1 composite fields (\u2191\u2191, \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191, \u2193\u2193)\nwhich have a projection of spin 1,0 and -1 respectively.\nThe fourth term describes the interaction of the spin singlet composite fields \u2191\u2193 \u2212 \u2193\u2191.

The constants J, \u03c10 and b are\nphenomenological ones subject to some relations. Finally, the spin-up and spin-down fermions have the following dispersion relations:\n~k 2\nJM\n\u01eb\u2193 (~k) =\n\u2212\u03bc+\n2m\n2\n\n(12)\n\n2M\n2M Dm (\u03c9, ~k) \u2192 Vm (~k) =\n\u03c1~k 2\n\nwhere the spin stiffness constant is proportional to M\n(\u03c1 = M \u03c10 ).

The relevant\ninteraction is that of the \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191 fields Eq.(16). It has\nan attracting part due to exchange of magnons and a\nrepulsive part due to exchange of paramagnons.\nThe effective Hamiltonian of the system is\nHef f = H0 + Hp\n\nExpending the potential V\u2212 (k) in terms of Legendre polynomial Pl one obtains that only the component with l = 1\ncontributes the gap equation.

In order to allow for an explicit analytic solution, I\nintroduce further simplifying assumptions by neglecting\nthe dependence of \u220610 (k) on k (\u220610 (k) = \u220610 (pf ) =\n\u2206) and setting V1 (pf , k) equal to a constant V1 within\ninterval (pf \u2212 \u039b, pf + \u039b) and zero elsewhere. The system\nof equations (22,23) is then reduced to the system\n\nIII Magnon-Induced Superconductivity\nBy means of the Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation\none introduces \u2191\u2193 + \u2193\u2191 composite field and then the\nfermions can be integrated out. The obtained free energy\nis a function of the composite field and the integral over\nthe composite field can be performed approximately by\nmeans of the steepest descend method. To this end one\nsets the first derivative of the free energy with respect to\ncomposite field equal to zero, this is the gap equation. To\nensure that the fermions which form Cooper pairs are the\nsame as those responsible for spontaneous magnetization,\none has to consider the equation for the magnetization\nas well.\n1\n+\nM = < c+\n\u2191 c\u2191 \u2212 c\u2193 c\u2193 >\n2\n\n(24)\n\n1\nM=\n8\u03c0 2\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndkk\n\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nJ 2 V1\n\u2206=\n32\u03c0 2\n\n(20)\n\npZ\nf +\u039b\n\ndkk\n\npf \u2212\u039b\n\nThe system of equations for the gap and for the magnetization determines the phase where the superconductivity\nand the ferromagnetism coexist.\nThe system can be written in terms of Bogoliubov excitations, which have the following dispersions relations:\nq\nJM\nE1 (~k) = \u2212\n\u2212 \u01eb2 (~k) + |\u2206(~k)|2\n2 q\nJM\n~\n(21)\n\u2212 \u01eb2 (~k) + |\u2206(~k)|2\nE2 (k) =\n2\n\nZ1\n\nwhere t = cos \u03b8.\n\ndt[1 \u2212 \u0398(\u2212E2 (k, t))]\n2\n\nZ1\n\n\u22121\n\n(26)\n\n\u0398(\u2212E2 (k, t))\n\u2206\ndt t2 q\n3 2 2\nt \u2206\n\u01eb2 (k) + 4\u03c0\n\nIII.1 Solution which satisfies\n\nq\n\n3\n\u03c0\u2206\n\n(27)\n\n< JM\n\nThe equation of magnetization (26) shows that it\nis convenient to represent the gap in the form \u2206 =\np\n\u03c0\n3 \u03ba(M )JM , where \u03ba(M ) < 1.

When\nthe magnetization increases, the domain of integration\nin the gap equation decreases. Near the quantum critical\npoint the size of the gap is small, and hence the linearized\ngap equation can be considered. Then it is easy to obtain\nthe critical value of the magnetization MSC [15]\n\nThe gap is an antisymmetric function \u2206(\u2212~k) =\n\u2212\u2206(~k), so that the expansion in terms of spherical harmonics Ylm (\u03a9~k ) contains only terms with odd l. I assume\nthat the component with l = 1 and m = 0 is nonzero and\nthe other ones are zero\n\n4\n\n\fWhen the magnetization approaches zero, the domain\nbetween the Fermi surfaces decreases.

Hence, the fundamental assumption that\nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism are caused by the\nsame electrons leads to the experimentally observable\nfact that the quantum phase transition is a transition\nto paramagnetic phase without superconductivity.\nAn important experimental fact is that ZrZn2 and\nU RhGe are superconductors at ambient pressure as opposed to the existence of a quantum phase transition\nin U Ge2 . To comprehend this difference one considers\nthe potential (25). The quantum phase transition results from the existence of a momentum cutoff \u039b, above\nwhich the potential is repulsive. In turn, the cutoff ex\u03c1\ncistence follows from the relation \u03b2 = 2Mb\n> 1, which\nis true when the spin-wave approximation expression for\nthe spin stiffness constant \u03c1 = M \u03c10 is used. The spin\nwave approximation correctly describes systems with a\nlarge magnetization, for example U Ge2 . But in order to\nstudy systems with small magnetization, one has to account for the magnon-magnon interaction which changes\nthe small magnetization asymptotic of \u03c1, \u03c1 = M 1+\u03b1 \u03c10 ,\nwhere \u03b1 > 0. Then for a small M \u03b2 < 1, and the\npotential is attractive for all momenta. Hence for systems which, at ambient pressure, are close to quantum\ncritical point, as ZrZn2 and U RhGe, the magnon selfinteraction renormalizes the spin fluctuations parameters\nso that the magnons dominate the pair formation and\nquantum phase transition can not be observed. But if\none applies an external magnetic field, the magnon opens\na gap proportional to the magnetic field. Increasing the\nmagnetic field the paramagnon domination leads to first\norder quantum phase transition.\n\nIV Conclusions\nThe proposed model of ferromagnetic superconductivity differs from the models discussed in [7,8,9,10] in many\naspects. First, the superconductivity is due to the exchange of magnons, and the model describes in an unified\nway the superconductivity in U Ge2 , ZrZn2 and U RhGe.\nSecond, the paramagnons have pair-breaking effect. So,\nthe understanding the mechanism of paramagnon suppression is crucial in the search for the ferromagnetic\nsuperconductivity with higher critical temperature. For\nexample, one can build such a bilayer compound that the\nspins in the two layers are oriented in two non-collinear\ndirections, and the net ferromagnetic moment is nonzero.\nThe paramagnon in this phase is totally suppressed and\nthe low lying excitations consist of magnons and additional spin wave modes with linear dispersion \u01eb(k) \u223c k\n[19]. If the new spin-waves are pair breaking, their effect\nis weaker than those of the paramagnons, and hence the\nsuperconducting critical temperature should be higher.\nThird, the order parameter is a spin antiparallel component of a spin triplet with zero spin projection. The\nexistence of two Fermi surfaces in each of the spin-up\nand spin-down momentum distribution functions leads\nto a linear temperature dependence of the specific heat\n\nat low temperature.\nThe proposed model of magnon-induced superconductivity does not contain the relativistic effects, namely\nspin-orbital coupling which is present in U Ge2 . The\nresulting magneto-crystalline anisotropy will modify the\nspin-wave excitation and will add a gap in the magnon\nspectrum, which changes the potential Eq.(25). The\nphysical consequence of the change is that the superconductivity disappears before the quantum phase transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism (see [6,14]).\nThe distance between these two points depends on the\nanisotropy.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank C.
