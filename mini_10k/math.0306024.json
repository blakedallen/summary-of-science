Conclusion\n1. Introduction\nIn their paper \"A note on Wittgenstein's 'notorious paragraph'about the G\u00f6del\nTheorem\"1 [FP00], Juliet Floyd and Hilary Putnam draw attention to Wittgenstein's\nremarks2 ([Wi78], Appendix III \u00a78):\nI imagine someone asking my advice; he says: \"I have constructed a proposition (I\nwill use 'P'to designate it) in Russell's symbolism, and by means of certain\ndefinitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says: 'P is not provable\nin Russell's system.'Must I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and\non the other hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is true that it is\nprovable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is proved, then it is proved that it is not\nprovable. Thus it can only be true, but unprovable.\"\n\n1\n\n2\n\nDownloadable PDF file.\n\nIn footnote 9, Floyd and Putnam [FP00] note that: The \"notorious\" paragraph RFM I Appendix III \u00a78 was\npenned on 23 September 1937, when Wittgenstein was in Norway (see the Wittgenstein papers, CD Rom,\nOxford University Press and the University of Bergen, 1998, Item 118 (Band XIV), pp. 106ff).\n\n\f3\n\nJust as we ask, \"'Provable'in what system?,\" so we must also ask, \"'True'in what\nsystem?\" \"True in Russell's system\" means, as was said, proved in Russell's system,\nand \"false in Russell's system\" means the opposite has been proved in Russell's\nsystem.--Now what does your \"suppose it is false\" mean? In the Russell sense it\nmeans, \"suppose the opposite is proved in Russell's system\"; if that is your\nassumption you will now presumably give up the interpretation that it is unprovable.\nAnd by \"this interpretation\" I understand the translation into this English sentence. -If you assume that the proposition is provable in Russell's system, that means it is\ntrue in the Russell sense, and the interpretation \"P is not provable\" again has to be\ngiven up. If you assume that the proposition is true in the Russell sense, the same\nthing follows. Further: if the proposition is supposed to be false in some other than\nthe Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it to be proved in Russell's\nsystem. (What is called \"losing\" in chess may constitute winning in another game.)\nFloyd and Putnam then argue that this paragraph contains a \"philosophical claim of great\ninterest which\":\n... is simply this: if one assumes (and, a fortiori if one actually finds out) that ~P is\nprovable in Russell's system one should ... give up the \"translation\" of P by the\nEnglish sentence \"P is not provable\".\nIn this paper, we argue that, although Wittgenstein's reservations on G\u00f6del's\ninterpretation of his own formal reasoning are, indeed, of historical importance, the\nuneasiness that academicians and philosophers such as Floyd and Putnam continue to\nsense, and express, over standard (text-book) interpretations of G\u00f6del's formal reasoning\n- even seventy years after the publication of his seminal 1931 paper [Go31a] - is of much\ngreater significance, and relevance, to us today.\n\n\f4\n\nIn a set of related, unpublshed, papers3, we argue that standard interpretations of\nfoundational concepts of classical mathematical theory may be implicitly influenced by,\nand built upon, some of G\u00f6del's questionable interpretations of his own formal\nreasoning4; hence such interpretations can be argued as being, prima facie, either\nambiguous, or non-constructive, or both.\nWe now argue further that Wittgenstein's reservations, and Floyd and Putnam's\nuneasiness, can - and arguably must, as we advocate in this paper - be seen as indicating\nspecific points of such ambiguity that need to be addressed on philosophical grounds,\nrather than dismissed on technicalities.\n\n2. What is mathematics?\n2.1 Mathematics as a set of formal languages\nWithout attempting to address the issue in its broader dimensions, we take Wittgenstein's\nremarks as implicitly indicating that mathematics is to be considered simply as a set of\nformal languages.\nAny language of such a set, say Peano Arithmetic PA5 (or Russell and Whitehead's\nPrincipia Mathematica, PM, or ZFC6), expresses - in a finite, unambiguous, and\ncommunicable manner - relations between concepts7 that are external to the language PA\n3\n\n[An02a] to [An03g].\n\n4\n\nFor instance, see [An02c], \u00a74.4 and \u00a74.5, and \u00a75 of [An03b].\n\n5\n\nBy \"PA\", or \"standard PA\", we mean the formal first order theory S defined by Mendelson ([Me64],\np102-3).\n6\n\nWe assume that \"PM\" and \"ZFC\" are familiar terms; the precise definitions of these formal languages is\nnot relevant to the arguments of this paper.\n7\n\nFor reasons that should become clearer later, we prefer the term \"concepts\" to the term \"entities\"; we\nintend to define some mathematical concepts as \"mathematical objects\", where some \"concept\" may not\nrepresent what we would intuitively term as an \"entity\".\n\n\f5\n\n(or to PM, or to ZFC). Each such language is, thus, essentially two-valued8, since a\nrelation9 either holds or does not hold externally (relative to the language).\nFurther, a selected, finite, number of primitive formal assertions10 about a finite set of\nselected primitive relations of, say, PA are defined as axiomatically PA-provable; all\nother assertions about relations that can be effectively11 defined in terms of the primitive\nrelations are termed as PA-provable if, and only if, there is a finite sequence of assertions\nof PA, each of which is either a primitive assertion, or which can effectively be\ndetermined in a finite number of steps as an immediate consequence of any two\nassertions preceding it in the sequence by a finite set of rules of consequence.\n2.2 An interpretation must be an effectively decidable translation\nAn effective interpretation12 of a language such as PA into another language, say PM (or\nZFC, or even English), is essentially the specification of an effective method by which\nany assertion of PA is translated unambiguously into a unique assertion of PM (or ZFC,\nor English). Clearly, if a relation is provable in PA, then it should be effectively decidable\nin any interpretation of PA - since a finite proof sequence of PA would, prima facie,\ntranslate as a finite proof sequence in the interpretation.\n\n8\n\nWe discuss the significance of this later in the section \u00a74.2 on omega-consistency.\n\n9\n\nThe term \"relation\" is thus treated as a primitive, undefined mathematical concept.\n\n10\n\nWe prefer the term \"formal assertion\" to the familiar terms \"formal sentence\", or \"formal proposition\",\nsince a paradigm shift is involved in interpreting the expression \"[(Ax)F(x)]\" constructively. For\nconvenience, we may also refer to a \"formal assertion\" as an \"assertion\", where the intention is clear from\nthe context.\n11\n\n12\n\n\"Effectively\" means by some finite, unambiguous, mechanical procedure (cf. [Me64], p 207).\n\nWe sometimes use the term \"interpretation\" as a noun in its commonly understood sense, and sometimes\nin a mathematical sense as in this instance; Mendelson ([Me64], \u00a72, p49) gives the more precise, classical,\ndefinition of the term when used in a mathematical sense. Unless specified otherwise, whether the term is\nto be understood generally, or in its mathematical sense, is determined by the context.\n\n\f6\n\n2.3 Is the converse necessarily true?\nThe question arises: If an assertion is decidable in an interpretation M of PA, then does\nsuch decidability translate into an effective method of decidability in PA?\nObviously, such a question can only be addressed unambiguously if there is an effective\nmethod for determining whether an assertion is decidable in M. If there is no such\neffective method, then we are faced with the following thesis that is implicit in, and\ncentral to, Wittgenstein's \"notorious\" remark:\nIf there is no effective method for the unambiguous decidability of assertions in a\nlanguage, then it is not a meaningful mathematical language.\nIn other words, in the absence of an effective method of decidability in M, any\ncorrelation of a PA-assertion with an assertion in M is essentially arguable, and it is\nmeaningless to ask whether an assertion of PA is decidable under interpretation in M or\nnot (the question of whether the assertion is decidable in PA or not is, then, an issue of\nsecondary consequence).\n2.4 Tarskian truth under the standard interpretation\nThe philosophical dimensions of this thesis emerge if we take M as the standard,\narithmetical, interpretation of PA, where [Me64]:\n(a) the set of non-negative integers is the domain,\n(b) the integer 0 is the interpretation of the symbol \"0\" of PA,\n(c) the successor operation (addition of 1) is the interpretation of the \" ' \" function\n(i.e. of f11),\n(d) ordinary addition and multiplication are the interpretations of \"+\" and \".\",\n\n\f7\n\n(e) the interpretation of the predicate letter \"=\" is the equality relation.\nNow, post-G\u00f6del, the standard interpretation of classical theory seems to be that:\n(f) PA can, indeed, be interpreted in M;\n(g) assertions in M are decidable by Tarski's definitions of satisfiability and truth (cf.\n[Me64], p49-53);\n(h) Tarskian truth and satisfiability are, however, not effectively verifiable in M13.\nHowever, the question, implicit in Wittgenstein's argument regarding the possibility of a\nsemantic contradiction in G\u00f6del's reasoning, then arises:\nHow can we assert that a PA-assertion (whether such an assertion is PA-provable or\nnot) is true under interpretation in M, so long as such truth remains effectively\nunverifiable in M?\nSince the issue is not resolved unambiguously by G\u00f6del in his 1931 paper (nor,\napparently, by subsequent standard interpretations of his formal reasoning and\nconclusions), Wittgenstein's remark can be taken to argue that, although we may validly\ndraw various conclusions from G\u00f6del's formal reasoning and conclusions, the existence\nof a true or false assertion of M cannot be amongst them.\n\n3. What is PA?\n3.1 Is PA an interpretation of its standard interpretation?\nA related philosophical issue is, then, the question:\n13\n\nWe take this as the interpretation of Tarski's 1936 Theorem (cf. [Me64], Corollary 3.38, p151): The set\nTr of G\u00f6del-numbers of wfs of PA which are true in the standard model is not arithmetical, i.e. there is no\nwf A(x) of PA such that Tr is the set of numbers k for which A(x) is true in the standard model.\n\n\f8\n\nIs PA an interpretation of its standard interpretation M?\nIn other words, since PA is intended to formalise our intuitive arithmetic M as expressed\nby Dedekind in his formulation of the Peano Postulates, do we accept that PA must be an\ninterpretation of M?14\n(The standard response to this question seems to lie at the heart of Wittgenstein's\nreservations, and to be the cause of the uneasiness felt by subsequent philosophers who\nquestion the standard interpretations of classical mathematical theory.)\nNow, a negative answer would imply that PA cannot be taken as a faithful formalisation\nof our intuitive, Dedekind, arithmetic; so, either (as standard interpretations of G\u00f6del's\nreasoning and conclusions implicitly imply) such arithmetic is not formalisable in\nprinciple, or there is some interpretation of M that formalises M more faithfully.\nThe former is, intuitively, an unappealing, Platonic, and implicitly self-limiting,\nadmission; the latter, an unacceptable reflection on the competence of mathematicians to\nadequately select an appropriate set of primitive, axiomatic, assertions for PA as may be\nneeded for PA to be an effective, and unambiguous, language of precise communication.\nAn affirmative answer, on the other hand, whilst validating PA as a formalisation of our\nintuitive, Dedekind arithmetic, would further imply that, since an assertion would then be\neffectively decidable in PA only if it were effectively decidable in M, there must be some\neffective method of defining Tarskian satisfiability and truth in M.\n\n14\n\nWe note that, prima facie, a strict formalist doctrine would avoid addressing this question; in other\nwords, it would accept PA as a standard formalisation of intuitive arithmetic, but treat both the possible\nrelationship of PA to the parent system that gave it birth, and the significance of the thesis \"PA is a\nstandard formalisation of intuitive arithmetic\", as being of no mathematical significance for the study of PA\nas a formal system, and of its interpretations.\n\n\f9\n\n3.2 Defining effective satisfiability and truth\nAlthough Wittgenstein does not appear to have attempted such a definition - possibly as it\nmay have seemed to involve technicalities beyond the scope of his reflections - we note\nin \u00a75.1 of Anand [An02c] that such an effective method is, indeed, made available to us\nby, curiously, a constructive interpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions; an\ninterpretation that is, ironically, more in sympathy with Wittgenstein's constructive\napproach than G\u00f6del's Platonic one.\n3.3 Undecidability in PA\nNow, the thesis of a constructive interpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions\n([An02c], \u00a75.1) is that we may not interpret, for instance, the meta-assertion \"PA proves:\n[(Ax)F(x)]15\" as the non-verifiable, Tarskian meta-assertion:\nF(x) is satisfied by any given element x of the domain of M16.\nWe must interpret it, instead, as the verifiable meta-assertion:\nThere is a uniform effective method (algorithm/Turing machine) such that, given any\nelement x of the domain of M, it will effectively decide that F(x) is satisfied in M.\nIt follows that the meta-assertion, that PA does not prove [(Ax)F(x)], interprets\nconstructively as the meta-assertion:\n\n15\n\nWe use square brackets to indicate that the expression within the brackets is to be treated as an\nabbreviation for an uninterpreted string of a formal system; we use double quotes to indicate that the\nexpression inside the quotes is to be treated as an abbreviation for an interpreted expression in some\nmathematical language.\n16\n\nAlthough standard interpretations of classical theory do not appear to highlight this point, this definition\nimplicitly implies that every element of the domain of M (which, by our definition of the language M,\nwould be considered external to M) is necessarily expressible in M.\n\n\f10\n\nThere is no uniform effective method (algorithm/Turing machine) such that, given\nany element x of M, it will effectively decide that F(x) is satisfied in M.\nConsequently, a constructive interpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions implies\nthat there can be no undecidable assertions in PA; in other words, that PA is syntactically\ncomplete!\n\n4. Standard interpretations of G\u00f6del's reasoning\n4.1 How definitive is the standard interpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning?\nHowever, we are, then, immediately faced with the question: Since the standard\ninterpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions asserts that PA is syntactically\nincomplete, how definitive is the standard interpretation?\nNow, in Theorem VI of his 1931 paper, G\u00f6del essentially argues that his \"undecidable\"\nproposition, [(Ax)R(x)], is such that (cf. [An02b], \u00a71.3-\u00a71.6):\nIf [(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable, then [~R(n)] is P-provable for some numeral [n].\nNow, by standard logical axioms, we have that:\nIf [~R(n)] is P-provable for some numeral [n], then [~(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable.\nIt thus follows that G\u00f6del has essentially argued that:\nIf [(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable, then [~(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable.\nClearly, it should now follow, by the standard Deduction Theorem of first order logic,\nthat:\n[(Ax)R(x) => ~(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable,\n\n\f11\n\nand so:\n[~(Ax)R(x)] is P-provable.\n4.2 We must conclude that PA is omega-inconsistent\nHowever, at this point, standard interpretations of G\u00f6del's reasoning appeal to his explicit\nassumption that PA is omega-consistent in order to conclude that the PA-provability of\n[~(Ax)R(x)] cannot be inferred from the above meta-argument.\nNow, unless the omega-consistency of PA has some deeper, intuitive significance\nphilosophically, this is not a reasonable inference; since the Deduction Theorem is a\nfundamental theorem of classical logic, we must, using Occam's razor, conclude from\nG\u00f6del's reasoning, firstly, that [~(Ax)R(x)] is PA-provable, and, secondly, that PA is\nomega-inconsistent (and so G\u00f6del's Theorem VI holds vacuously [An02b]).\nWe note that Wittgenstein's remarks indicate that, prima facie, there appear no intuitively\nsignificant philosophical grounds for treating the omega-consistency of PA as a primitive\nconcept; prima facie, there are thus no reasonable grounds for allowing it to over-ride an\napplication of the Deduction Theorem.\nIn sharp contrast, we note that the omega-inconsistency of PA is natural, and intuitively\nunobjectionable, under a constructive interpretation of the concept of \"PA proves:\n[(Ax)F(x)]\" as described earlier; under such interpretation, an omega-inconsistent PA\ndoes not imply that PA, or any of its interpretations, are either inconsistent, or unnaturally\nconsistent (cf. [An02b], Appendix 2). It simply implies that there are arithmetical\nrelations that cannot be verified uniformly by a common algorithm over the domain of\ntheir interpretation.\n\n\f12\n\nMoreover, as we argue in Anand ([An03c], Appendix 1), this interpretation implies that\nPA can express relations that are deterministic, yet essentially unpredictable; such a\nlanguage would have significance for the expression of natural phenomena that are best\ndescribed in quantum mechanical terms.\nThe above suggests that it may be the absence of an adequately technical counterargument that leaves Wittgenstein's viewpoint - and that of others who have shared his\nreservations - vulnerable to the arguments advanced by standard interpretations of\nG\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusion; these implicitly imply that any interpretation of\nG\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusion must be accepted as essentially counter-intuitive on the\nbasis of purely technical considerations.\n4.3 Rosser's argument may be invalid\nPrima facie, the standard interpretation of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions seems\nstrengthened by Rosser's argument that G\u00f6delian undecidability can be established in a\nsimply consistent language without assuming omega-consistency. However, as shown in\nAnand ([An02a], \u00a77.4(b)(x)(3)), if standard (text-book) expositions ([Me64], p145,\nProposition 3.32) of Rosser's proof can be accepted as definitive, then Rosser's argument\nis invalid.\n\n5. When does a formal assertion \"mean\" what it represents?\nAn important philosophical issue - which does not seem to have been adequately\naddressed by standard interpretations of classical theory as yet - is implicit in the key\nthesis of Floyd and Putnam's paper, and is reflected in Wittgenstein's remark:\nIf you assume that the proposition is provable in Russell's system, that means it is\ntrue in the Russell sense, and the interpretation \"P is not provable\" ... has to be given\nup.\n\n\f13\n\n5.1 When does a formal assertion \"mean\" what it represents?\nWe may state this issue explicitly as:\n(*)\n\nWhen does a formal assertion \"mean\" what it represents?\n\nNow, if, as argued earlier, we accept that PA formalises our intuitive arithmetic M, and\nthat M is the standard interpretation of PA, it follows that every well-formed formula of\nPA interprets as a well-defined arithmetical expression, and every well-defined\narithmetical expression can be represented as a PA-formula.\nThe question then arises:\nWhen is an arbitrary number-theoretic function or relation representable in PA?\n5.2 Formal expressibility and representability\nClassically, the question of PA-representability is addressed by the following three\ndefinitions (cf. [Me64], p117-118):\n(a) A number-theoretic relation R(x1, ..., xn) is said to be expressible in PA if, and\nonly if, there is a well-formed formula [A(x1, ..., xn)] of PA with n free variables\nsuch that, for any natural numbers k1, ..., kn:\n(i) if R(k1, ..., kn) is true, then PA proves: [A(k1, ..., kn)],\n(ii) if R(k1, ..., kn) is false, then PA proves: [~A(k1, ..., kn)],\n(b) A number-theoretic function f(x1, ..., xn) is said to be representable in PA if, and\nonly if, there is a well-formed formula [A(x1, ..., xn, y)] of PA, with the free\nvariables x1, ..., xn, y, such that, for any natural numbers k1, ..., kn, l:\n(i) if f(k1, ..., kn) = l, then PA proves: [A(k1, ..., kn, l)],\n\n\f14\n\n(ii) PA proves: [(E!l)A(k1, ..., kn, l)],\n(c) A number-theoretic function f(x1, ..., xn) is said to be strongly representable in PA\nif, and only if, there is a well-formed formula [A(x1, ..., xn, y)] of PA, with the\nfree variables x1, ..., xn, y, such that, for any natural numbers k1, ..., kn, l:\n(i) if f(k1, ..., kn) = l, then PA proves: [A(k1, ..., kn, l)],\n(ii) PA proves: [(E!l)A(x1, ..., xn, y)],\n5.3 When may we assert that A(x1, ..., xn) \"means\" R(x1, ..., xn)?\nWe can, thus, re-phrase our earlier question (*) as:\nIf a number-theoretic relation R(x1, ..., xn) is expressible by a PA-formula [A(x1, ...,\n\nxn)], when may we assert that, under the standard interpretation, A(x1, ..., xn) \"means\"\nR(x1, ..., xn)?\nNow we note that, if R(x1, ..., xn) is arithmetical, then one of its PA-representation is\n[R(x1, ..., xn)]17, whose standard interpretation is R(x1, ..., xn). Hence every arithmetical\nrelation is the standard interpretation of some PA-formula that expresses R(x1, ..., xn) in\nPA, and we can adapt this to give a formal definition of the term \"means\":\nDefinition 1: If a number-theoretic relation R(x1, ..., xn) is expressible by a PAformula [A(x1, ..., xn)], then we say that, under the standard interpretation, A(x1, ...,\n\nxn) means R(x1, ..., xn) if, and only if, R(x1, ..., xn) is the standard interpretation of\nsome PA-formula that expresses R(x1, ..., xn) in PA.\n\n17\n\nWe note that, if R(x1, ..., xn) is PA-expressible, then there are denumerable formulas that express it in\nPA.\n\n\f15\n\nThe question (*) can now be expressed precisely as:\n(**) When is a number-theoretic relation the standard interpretation of some PAformula that expresses it in PA?\nNow, by definition, the number-theoretic relation R(x1, ..., xn), and the arithmetic relation\nA(x1, ..., xn), can be effectively shown as equivalent for any given set of natural number\nvalues for the free variables contained in them.\nHowever, for R(x1, ..., xn) to mean A(x1, ..., xn), we must have, in addition, that R(x1, ...,\n\nxn) can be effectively transformed into an arithmetical expression, so that it can be the\nstandard interpretation of some PA-formula that expresses it in PA.\n5.4 What is a mathematical object?\nClearly, this implies, firstly, that we must be able to add [R] as a primitive, n-ary, relation\nletter to PA, along with suitable axioms, without inviting inconsistency; and, secondly,\nthat R(x1, ..., xn) must define a unique mathematical object, where we define (cf.\n[An02c], \u00a71.2):\n(i) Primitive mathematical object: A primitive mathematical object is any symbol\nfor an individual constant, predicate letter, or a function letter, which is defined as a\nprimitive symbol of a formal mathematical language.\n(ii) Formal mathematical object: A formal mathematical object is any symbol for an\nindividual constant, predicate letter, or a function letter that is either a primitive\nmathematical object, or that can be introduced through definition into a formal\nmathematical language without inviting inconsistency.\n\n\f16\n\n(iii) Mathematical object: A mathematical object is any symbol that is either a\nprimitive mathematical object, or a formal mathematical object.\nNow, the logical and mathematical antinomies show that we cannot unrestrictedly assume\nthat every arithmetical relation defines a mathematical object18. However, if we can\nintroduce the n-ary relation letter [R] into PA as above, without inviting inconsistency,\nthen we can, reasonably, assert that the relation R(x1, ..., xn) does, indeed, define a\nmathematical object in a constructive and intuitionistically unobjectionable way, and that\nA(x1, ..., xn) does mean R(x1, ..., xn).\n5.5 Introduction of new symbols by definition\nNow, the question:\nWhen may we introduce an additional function or relation letter into PA without\ninviting inconsistency.\nis addressed classically by the following proposition (cf. [Me64], Proposition 2.29, p82):\nProposition: Let K be a first-order theory with equality. Assume that K proves:\n[(E!u)A(u, y1, ..., yn). Let K' be the first-order theory with equality obtained by\nadding to K a new function letter f of n arguments, and the proper axiom [A(f(y1, ...,\n\nyn), y1, ..., yn), as well as all instances of the axioms of a first order theory involving f.\nThen there is an effective transformation mapping each well-formed formula B of K'\ninto a well-formed formula B' of K such that:\n\n18\n\nWe note that, by defining a mathematical object precisely, the paradoxical element in the mathematical\nand logical \"antinomies\" is effectively eliminated; they define functions or relations that are not\nmathematical objects. Prima facie, except from a Platonic viewpoint, it thus seems of little significance\nwhether such definitions are taken as defining entities that are mathematically inconsistent (square circle),\narguably inconsistent (Pegasus), logically inconsistent (Russell's impredicative set), or mathematical nonobjects (the range of G\u00f6del's primitive recursive substitution relation).\n\n\f17\n\n(a) if f does not occur in [B], then [B'] is [B];\n(b) [(~B)'] is [~(B')];\n(c) [(B => C)'] is [B' => C'];\n(d) [((Ax)B)'] is [(Ax)B'];\n(e) K' proves: [B <=> B'];\n(f) if K' proves: B, then K proves: B'.\nHence, if B does not contain f, and K' proves: B, then K proves: B.\nIt follows that a number-theoretic function f (or relation R, if we treat R as a Boolean\nfunction) may be taken to define a mathematical object if it is strongly representable in\nPA; we may then introduce the function letter [f] into PA without risking inconsistency,\nand we would then have that f(x1, ..., xn) is represented in PA by the formula [f(x1, ...,\n\nxn)], whose standard interpretation is f(x1, ..., xn).\n6. Why P cannot be interpreted as \"P is not provable in PA\"\n6.1 A recursive number-theoretic function that is not a mathematical object\nApart from the trivial resolution of the mathematical and logical paradoxes (footnote 18),\nthe significance of the above definitions is that G\u00f6del's primitive recursive substitution\nfunction, Sb(x v|y) (cf. [Go31a], definition 31, p20), is, remarkably, not a mathematical\nobject!\nAs we note in Anand [An02c]:\nThe significance of these definitions is seen in Meta-theorem 1. We prove, there, the\nexistence of an asymmetrical recursive number-theoretic relation - one that is\n\n\f18\n\nintuitively decidable constructively, but which cannot be introduced through\ndefinition as a formal mathematical object into any formal system of Peano\nArithmetic without inviting inconsistency; nor, ipso facto, into any Axiomatic Set\nTheory that models19 (cf. [Me64], p192-3) such Arithmetic. Hence, it is not a formal\nmathematical object, and the range of its characteristic function20 is not a recursively\nenumerable set21!\nThis is an astonishing result22! Firstly, recursive number-theoretic functions and\nrelations are classically accepted as the basic building blocks for defining\nconstructive, and intuitionistically unobjectionable, mathematical objects23. Secondly,\nand in vivid contrast, the relative consistency, and independence, of the Continuum\nHypothesis would imply, prima facie, that we may also treat Cantor's nonconstructive cardinal, aleph1, as a valid formal mathematical object24; thus, we may\nintroduce axiomatic definitions - and an individual constant symbol - for it into any\nAxiomatic Set Theory without inviting inconsistency!\n\n19\n\nWe follow Mendelson's definition of a model ([Me64], p51): An interpretation is said to be a model for a\nset T of well-formed formulas of P if, and only if, every well-formed formula in T is true for the\ninterpretation in the classical Tarskian sense.\n20\n\nIf R(x) is a relation (predicate), then the characteristic function CR(x) is defined as follows: CR(x) = 0 if\nR(x) is true, and CR(x) = 1 if R(x) is false ([Me64], p119).\n21\n\nA recursively enumerable set is classically defined as the range of some recursive number-theoretic\nfunction, and is implicitly assumed consistent with any Axiomatic Set Theory that is a model for P\n([Me64], p250).\n22\n\nLoosely speaking, it may be viewed as a constructive arithmetical parallel to Russell's non-constructive,\nand seemingly paradoxical, impredicative \"set\" ([Me64], p2).\n\n23\n\n24\n\nSee, for instance, G\u00f6del's remarks ([Go31a], p23, footnote 39).\n\nThis, essentially, seems to reflect G\u00f6del's point of view, which he expresses in his 1947 paper, \"What is\nCantor's continuum problem?\", whilst discussing whether Cantor's continuum hypothesis should be added\nto set theory as a new axiom. [Kurt G\u00f6del, Collected Works, vol. 2, Oxford University Press, 1986\u20132003.]\n\n\f19\n\nIn other words, Meta-theorem 1 in Anand [An02c] establishes that there is no PAformula that can mean Sb(x v|y) under interpretation.\n6.2 No PA-formula P can interpret as \"P is not provable in PA\"\nNow we note that G\u00f6del's number-theoretic relation Bew(x) - which holds if, and only if,\n\nx is the G\u00f6del-number of some PA-provable formula P - is defined ([Go31a], definition\n46, p22) in terms of his primitive recursive number-theoretical relation Sb(x v|y). It\nfollows that, since the latter is not a mathematical object, neither is the former.\nThus, there is no PA-formula that can mean Bew(x) under interpretation; ipso facto, there\nis no PA-formula that can interpret as an arithmetic assertion that is equivalent to the\nassertion \"P is not provable in PA\". As we remark in Anand ([An02c], \u00a7II(3)), such an\nassertion can only be a convention, not an arguable inference.\n6.3 No PA-formula can interpret as \"PA is consistent\"\nIt also follows that if the concept of \"PA-provability\", as defined by G\u00f6del, cannot be\nexpressed in PA, then G\u00f6del's Theorem XI [Go31a], which asserts that the consistency of\nPA cannot be established within a consistent PA, must hold vacuously. This argument is\ndiscussed in detail in Anand ([An02c], \u00a7II), where we prove Theorem 2, to the effect that\nno PA-formula can mean \"PA is consistent\" under the standard interpretation.\nWe essentially argue there that:\nIf we assume that the number-theoretic sentence (Ex)(Form(x) & ~Bew(x)) ([Go31a],\np36, footnote 63), abbreviated Wid(PA), defines the proposition \"PA is consistent\" in\na constructive and intuitionistically unobjectionable way25, then can we consistently\n25\n\nIn other words, this definition can be assumed equivalent to Mendelson's classical meta-definition of\nconsistency ([Me64], p37). We argue in Anand ([An02c], \u00a7II-2), albeit in a different context, that this\nassumption, too, may conceal an implicit ambiguity.\n\n\f20\n\nassume further that Wid(PA) is equivalent to the standard interpretation of some PAformula [Con(PA)]?\n... the latter assumption is one of the implicit meta-theses that appear to underlie\nG\u00f6del's proof of, and the conclusions he draws from, his Theorem XI ([Go31a], p36).\nClearly, the reasoning in Meta-theorem 1 and Meta-lemma 2 implies that such an\nassumption is invalid26. We conclude that there is no PA-formula, Con(PA), whose\nstandard interpretation is the number-theoretic assertion (Ex)(Form(x) & ~Bew(x)) which is defined by G\u00f6del as equivalent to \"PA is consistent\".\n7. Conclusion\nWe conclude that standard interpretations of G\u00f6del's reasoning and conclusions are not\ndefinitive. Wittgenstein's reservations on G\u00f6del's interpretation of his own formal\nreasoning, as reflected in his \"notorious\" paragraph, and the uneasiness that academicians\nand philosophers such as Floyd and Putnam continue to sense, and express, over standard\ninterpretations of G\u00f6del's formal reasoning, must be respected as significant indicators of\npossible ambiguities that may be rooted in implicit assumptions underlying standard\ninterpretations of classical foundational concepts.\n\nReferences\n[An02a] Anand, B.
