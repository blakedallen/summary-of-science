We denote the set of all such hypersurfaces by H(2n).\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose U contains the origin. We consider closed characteristics\n(\u03c4, y) on \u03a3, which are solutions of the following problem\n(\n\n0\n\n\u2212In\n\n\u1e8f = JN\u03a3 (y),\ny(\u03c4 ) = y(0),\n\n!\n\n(1.1)\n\n, In is the identity matrix in Rn , \u03c4 > 0, N\u03a3 (y) is the outward normal vector\nIn\n0\nof \u03a3 at y normalized by the condition N\u03a3 (y) * y = 1. Here a * b denotes the standard inner product\n\nwhere J =\n\n\u2217\n\nPartially supported by NNSF, RFDP of MOE of China. E-mail: alexanderweiwang@yahoo.com.cn\n\n1\n\n\fof a, b \u2208 R2n . A closed characteristic (\u03c4, y) is prime, if \u03c4 is the minimal period of y. Two closed\ncharacteristics (\u03c4, y) and (\u03c3, z) are geometrically distinct, if y(R) 6= z(R). We denote by J (\u03a3) and\nJe(\u03a3) the set of all closed characteristics (\u03c4, y) on \u03a3 with \u03c4 being the minimal period of y and the set\n\nof all geometrically distinct ones respectively. Note that J (\u03a3) = {\u03b8 * y | \u03b8 \u2208 S 1 , y is prime}, while\nJe(\u03a3) = J (\u03a3)/S 1 , where the natural S 1 -action is defined by \u03b8 * y(t) = y(t + \u03c4 \u03b8), \u2200\u03b8 \u2208 S 1 , t \u2208 R.\n\nLet j : R2n \u2192 R be the gauge function of \u03a3, i.e., j(\u03bbx) = \u03bb for x \u2208 \u03a3 and \u03bb \u2265 0, then\n\nj \u2208 C 3 (R2n \\ {0}, R) \u2229 C 0 (R2n , R) and \u03a3 = j \u22121 (1). Fix a constant \u03b1 \u2208 (1, 2) and define the\n\nHamiltonian function H\u03b1 : R2n \u2192 [0, +\u221e) by\n\nH\u03b1 (x) = j(x)\u03b1 ,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 R2n .\n\n(1.2)\n\nThen H\u03b1 \u2208 C 3 (R2n \\ {0}, R) \u2229 C 1 (R2n , R) is convex and \u03a3 = H\u03b1\u22121 (1). It is well known that the\nproblem (1.1) is equivalent to the following given energy problem of the Hamiltonian system\n(\n\n\u1e8f(t) = JH\u03b1\u2032 (y(t)),\n\nH\u03b1 (y(t)) = 1,\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R.\n\ny(\u03c4 ) = y(0).\n\n(1.3)\n\nDenote by J (\u03a3, \u03b1) the set of all solutions (\u03c4, y) of (1.3) where \u03c4 is the minimal period of y and\n\nby Je(\u03a3, \u03b1) the set of all geometrically distinct solutions of (1.3). As above, Je(\u03a3, \u03b1) is obtained\n\nfrom J (\u03a3, \u03b1) by dividing the natural S 1 -action. Note that elements in J (\u03a3) and J (\u03a3, \u03b1) are one\nto one correspondent to each other, similarly for Je(\u03a3) and Je(\u03a3, \u03b1).\n\nLet (\u03c4, y) \u2208 J (\u03a3, \u03b1). The fundamental solution \u03b3y : [0, \u03c4 ] \u2192 Sp(2n) with \u03b3y (0) = I2n of the\n\nlinearized Hamiltonian system\n\u1e87(t) = JH\u03b1\u2032\u2032 (y(t))w(t),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R,\n\n(1.4)\n\nis called the associate symplectic path of (\u03c4, y). The eigenvalues of \u03b3y (\u03c4 ) are called Floquet multipliers of (\u03c4, y). By Proposition 1.6.13 of [Eke3], the Floquet multipliers with their multiplicities\nof (\u03c4, y) \u2208 J (\u03a3) do not depend on the particular choice of the Hamiltonian function in (1.3). For\nany M \u2208 Sp(2n), we define the elliptic height e(M ) of M to be the total algebraic multiplicity of\nall eigenvalues of M on the unit circle U = {z \u2208 C| |z| = 1} in the complex plane C. Since M is\nsymplectic, e(M ) is even and 0 \u2264 e(M ) \u2264 2n. As usual a (\u03c4, y) \u2208 J (\u03a3) is elliptic, if e(\u03b3y (\u03c4 )) = 2n.\nIt is non-degenerate, if 1 is a double Floquet multiplier of it. It is hyperbolic, if 1 is a double Floquet\nmultiplier of it and e(\u03b3y (\u03c4 )) = 2. It is well known that these concepts are independent of the choice\nof \u03b1 > 1.\nFor the existence and multiplicity of geometrically distinct closed characteristics on convex\ncompact hypersurfaces in R2n we refer to [Rab1], [Wei1], [EkL1], [EkH1], [Szu1], [HWZ1], [LoZ1],\n2\n\n\f[LLZ1], and references therein. Note that recently in [WHL], Wang, Hu and Long proved\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n\u2265\n\n3 for every \u03a3 \u2208 H(6).\nOn the stability problem, in [Eke2] of Ekeland in 1986 and [Lon2] of Long in 1998, for any\n\u03a3 \u2208 H(2n) the existence of at least one non-hyperbolic closed characteristic on \u03a3 was proved\nprovided\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n< +\u221e. Ekeland proved also in [Eke2] the existence of at least one elliptic closed\n\u221a\ncharacteristic on \u03a3 provided \u03a3 \u2208 H(2n) is 2-pinched. In [DDE1] of 1992, Dell'Antonio, D'Onofrio\n\nand Ekeland proved the existence of at least one elliptic closed characteristic on \u03a3 provided \u03a3 \u2208\nH(2n) satisfies \u03a3 = \u2212\u03a3. In [Lon3] of 2000, Long proved that \u03a3 \u2208 H(4) and\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n= 2 imply that\n\nboth of the closed characteristics must be elliptic. In [LoZ1] of 2002, Long and Zhu further proved\nwhen\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n< +\u221e, there exists at least one elliptic closed characteristic and there are at least\n\n[ n2 ] geometrically distinct closed characteristics on \u03a3 possessing irrational mean indices, which are\nthen non-hyperbolic. In the recent paper [LoW1], Long and Wang proved that there exist at least\ntwo non-hyperbolic closed characteristic on \u03a3 \u2208 H(6) when\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n< +\u221e. Motivated by these\n\nresults, we prove the following results in this paper:\nTheorem 1.1. On every \u03a3 \u2208 H(6) satisfying\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\n< +\u221e, there exist at least two geometri-\n\ncally distinct closed characteristics possessing irrational mean indices.\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose\n\n# J \u0303(\u03a3)\n\nclosed characteristics in J \u0303(\u03a3).\n\n= 3 for some \u03a3 \u2208 H(6). Then there exist at least two elliptic\n\nThe proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are given in Section 3. Mainly ingredients in the proofs\ninculde: the mean index identity for closed characteristics established in [WHL] recently, Morse\ninequality and the index iteration theory developed by Long and his coworkers, specially the common index jump theorem of Long and Zhu (Theorem 4.3 of [LoZ1], cf. Theorem 11.2.1 of [Lon4]).\nIn Section 2, we review briefly the equivariant Morse theory and the mean index identity for closed\ncharacteristics on compact convex hypersurfaces in R2n developed in the recent [WHL].\nIn this paper, let N, N0 , Z, Q, R, and R+ denote the sets of natural integers, non-negative\nintegers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and positive real numbers respectively. Denote\nby a * b and |a| the standard inner product and norm in R2n . Denote by h*, *i and k * k the standard\n\nL2 -inner product and L2 -norm. For an S 1 -space X, we denote by XS 1 the homotopy quotient of\nX module the S 1 -action, i.e., XS 1 = S \u221e \u00d7S 1 X. We define the functions\n(\n\n[a] = max{k \u2208 Z | k \u2264 a}, E(a) = min{k \u2208 Z | k \u2265 a},\n\u03c6(a) = E(a) \u2212 [a],\n\n(1.5)\n\nSpecially, \u03c6(a) = 0 if a \u2208 Z , and \u03c6(a) = 1 if a \u2208\n/ Z . In this paper we use only Q-coefficients for all\n\nhomological modules. For a Zm -space pair (A, B), let H\u2217 (A, B)\u00b1Zm = {\u03c3 \u2208 H\u2217 (A, B) | L\u2217 \u03c3 = \u00b1\u03c3},\n3\n\n\fwhere L is a generator of the Zm -action.\n\n2\n\nEquivariant Morse theory for closed characteristics\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we fix a \u03a3 \u2208 H(2n) and assume the following condition on \u03a3:\n(F) There exist only finitely many geometrically distinct closed characteristics\n{(\u03c4j , yj )}1\u2264j\u2264k on \u03a3.\nIn this section, we review briefly the equivariant Morse theory for closed characteristics on \u03a3\ndeveloped in [WHL] which will be needed in Section 3 of this paper. All the details of proofs can\nbe found in [WHL].\nLet \u03c4\u0302 = inf{\u03c4j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k}. Note that here \u03c4j 's are prime periods of yj 's for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Then\n\nby \u00a72 of [WHL], for any a > \u03c4\u0302 , we can construct a function \u03c6a \u2208 C \u221e (R, R+ ) which has 0 as its\nunique critical point in [0, +\u221e) such that \u03c6a is strictly convex for t \u2265 0. Moreover,\n\u03c6\u2032a (t)\nt\n\ndecreasing for t > 0 together with limt\u21920+\n\n\u03c6\u2032a (t)\nt\n\nis strictly\n\n= 1 and \u03c6a (0) = 0 = \u03c6\u2032a (0). More precisely, we\n\ndefine \u03c6a via Propositions 2.2 and 2.4 in [WHL]. The precise dependence of \u03c6a on a is explained\nin Remark 2.3 of [WHL].\nDefine the Hamiltonian function Ha (x) = a\u03c6a (j(x)) and consider the fixed period problem\n(\n\n\u1e8b(t) = JHa\u2032 (x(t)),\n\n(2.1)\n\nx(1) = x(0).\n\nThen Ha \u2208 C 3 (R2n \\ {0}, R) \u2229 C 1 (R2n , R) is strictly convex. Solutions of (2.1) are x \u2261 0 and\nx = \u03c1y(\u03c4 t) with\n\n\u03c6\u2032a (\u03c1)\n\u03c1\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\na,\n\nwhere (\u03c4, y) is a solution of (1.1). In particular, nonzero solutions of\n\n(2.1) are one to one correspondent to solutions of (1.1) with period \u03c4 < a.\nIn the following, we use the Clarke-Ekeland dual action principle. As usual, let Ga be the\nFenchel transform of Ha defined by Ga (y) = sup{x * y \u2212 Ha (x) | x \u2208 R2n }. Then Ga \u2208 C 2 (R2n \\\n{0}, R) \u2229 C 1 (R2n , R) is strictly convex.

The\n\n(2.3)\n\nThen the functional \u03a8a \u2208 C 1,1 (L20 (S 1 , R2n ), R) is bounded from below and satisfies the PalaisSmale condition. Suppose x is a solution of (2.1). Then u = \u1e8b is a critical point of \u03a8a . Conversely,\n4\n\n\fsuppose u is a critical point of \u03a8a . Then there exists a unique \u03be \u2208 R2n such that M u \u2212 \u03be is a\nsolution of (2.1). In particular, solutions of (2.1) are in one to one correspondence with critical\npoints of \u03a8a . Moreover, \u03a8a (u) < 0 for every critical point u 6= 0 of \u03a8a .\nSuppose u is a nonzero critical point of \u03a8a . Then following [Eke3] the formal Hessian of \u03a8a at\nu is defined by\nQa (v, v) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n(Jv * M v + G\u2032\u2032a (\u2212Ju)Jv * Jv)dt,\n\nwhich defines an orthogonal splitting L20 = E\u2212 \u2295 E0 \u2295 E+ of L20 (S 1 , R2n ) into negative, zero and\npositive subspaces. The index of u is defined by i(u) = dim E\u2212 and the nullity of u is defined\nby \u03bd(u) = dim E0 . Let u = \u1e8b be the critical point of \u03a8a such that x corresponds to the closed\ncharacteristic (\u03c4, y) on \u03a3. Then the index i(u) and the nullity \u03bd(u) defined above coincide with\nthe Ekeland indices defined by I. Ekeland in [Eke1] and [Eke3]. Specially 1 \u2264 \u03bd(u) \u2264 2n \u2212 1 always\nholds.\nWe have a natural S 1 -action on L20 (S 1 , R2n ) defined by \u03b8 * u(t) = u(\u03b8 + t) for all \u03b8 \u2208 S 1 and\n\nt \u2208 R. Clearly \u03a8a is S 1 -invariant. For any \u03ba \u2208 R, we denote by\n\n\u039b\u03baa = {u \u2208 L20 (S 1 , R2n ) | \u03a8a (u) \u2264 \u03ba}.\n\n(2.4)\n\nFor a critical point u of \u03a8a , we denote by\na (u)\n\u039ba (u) = \u039b\u03a8\n= {w \u2208 L20 (S 1 , R2n ) | \u03a8a (w) \u2264 \u03a8a (u)}.\na\n\n(2.5)\n\nClearly, both sets are S 1 -invariant. Since the S 1 -action preserves \u03a8a , if u is a critical point of \u03a8a ,\nthen the whole orbit S 1 * u is formed by critical points of \u03a8a . Denote by crit(\u03a8a ) the set of critical\npoints of \u03a8a . Note that by the condition (F), the number of critical orbits of \u03a8a is finite. Hence\nas usual we can make the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1. Suppose u is a nonzero critical point of \u03a8a and N is an S 1 -invariant open\n\nneighborhood of S 1 * u such that crit(\u03a8a ) \u2229 (\u039ba (u) \u2229 N ) = S 1 * u. Then the S 1 -critical modules of\nS 1 * u are defined by\n\nCS 1 , q (\u03a8a , S 1 * u) = Hq ((\u039ba (u) \u2229 N )S 1 , ((\u039ba (u) \\ S 1 * u) \u2229 N )S 1 ).\nWe have the following proposition for critical modules.\nProposition 2.2. (Proposition 3.2 of [WHL]) The critical module CS 1 , q (\u03a8a , S 1 * u) is independent of a in the sense that if xi are solutions of (2.1) with Hamiltonian functions Hai (x) \u2261\n\n5\n\n\fai \u03c6ai (j(x)) for i = 1 and 2 respectively such that both x1 and x2 correspond to the same closed\ncharacteristic (\u03c4, y) on \u03a3. Then we have\nCS 1 , q (\u03a8a1 , S 1 * \u1e8b1 ) \u223c\n= CS 1 , q (\u03a8a2 , S 1 * \u1e8b2 ),\n\n\u2200q \u2208 Z.\n\nNow let u 6= 0 be a critical point of \u03a8a with multiplicity mul(u) = m, i.e., u corresponds to\na closed characteristic (m\u03c4, y) \u2282 \u03a3 with (\u03c4, y) being prime. Hence u(t +\n\n1\nm)\n\n= u(t) holds for all\n\nt \u2208 R and the orbit of u, namely, S 1 * u \u223c\n= S 1 /Zm \u223c\n= S 1 . Let f : N (S 1 * u) \u2192 S 1 * u be the\n\nnormal bundle of S 1 * u in L20 (S 1 , R2n ) and let f \u22121 (\u03b8 * u) = N (\u03b8 * u) be the fibre over \u03b8 * u, where\n\u03b8 \u2208 S 1 . Let DN (S 1 * u) be the \u033a-disk bundle of N (S 1 * u) for some \u033a > 0 sufficiently small, i.e.,\n\nDN (S 1 * u) = {\u03be \u2208 N (S 1 * u) | k\u03bek < \u033a} and let DN (\u03b8 * u) = f \u22121 (\u03b8 * u) \u2229 DN (S 1 * u) be the disk\n\nover \u03b8 * u. Clearly, DN (\u03b8 * u) is Zm -invariant and we have DN (S 1 * u) = DN (u) \u00d7Zm S 1 , where the\nZm -action is given by\n(\u03b8, v, t) \u2208 Zm \u00d7 DN (u) \u00d7 S 1 7\u2192 (\u03b8 * v, \u03b8 \u22121 t) \u2208 DN (u) \u00d7 S 1 .\nHence for an S 1 -invariant subset \u0393 of DN (S 1 * u), we have \u0393/S 1 = (\u0393u \u00d7Zm S 1 )/S 1 = \u0393u /Zm ,\n\nwhere \u0393u = \u0393 \u2229 DN (u). Since \u03a8a is not C 2 on L20 (S 1 , R2n ), we need to use a finite dimensional\napproximation introduced by Ekeland in order to apply Morse theory. More precisely, we can\nconstruct a finite dimensional submanifold \u0393(\u03b9) of L20 (S 1 , R2n ) which admits a Z\u03b9 -action with m|\u03b9.\nMoreover \u03a8a and \u03a8a |\u0393(\u03b9) have the same critical points. \u03a8a |\u0393(\u03b9) is C 2 in a small tubular neighborhood\n\nof the critical orbit S 1 * u and the Morse index and nullity of its critical points coincide with those\nof the corresponding critical points of \u03a8a . Let\nD\u03b9 N (S 1 * u) = DN (S 1 * u) \u2229 \u0393(\u03b9),\n\nD\u03b9 N (\u03b8 * u) = DN (\u03b8 * u) \u2229 \u0393(\u03b9).\n\n(2.6)\n\nThen we have\nCS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a8a , S 1 * u) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (\u039ba (u) \u2229 D\u03b9 N (u), (\u039ba (u) \\ {u}) \u2229 D\u03b9 N (u))Zm .\n\n(2.7)\n\nNow we can apply the results of Gromoll and Meyer in [GrM1] to the manifold Dp\u03b9 N (up ) with up\nas its unique critical point, where p \u2208 N.

By Lemma 8 in P.206 of [Eke3], we can use Theorem 1.4.2 of [Cha1] in the equivariant\nform to obtain\nHS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a6ci +\u01eb , \u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb ) =\n\nM\n\n\u03a6(u)=ci\n\nCS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a6, S 1 * u),\n\n(3.11)\n\nfor \u01eb small enough such that the interval (ci \u2212 \u01eb, ci + \u01eb) contains no critical values of \u03a6 except ci .\nSimilar to P.431 of [EkH1], we have\np\u2217\n\nq\u2217\n\nH 2(i\u22121) ((\u03a6ci +\u01eb )S 1 , (\u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb )S 1 )\u2212\u2192H 2(i\u22121) ((\u03a6ci +\u01eb )S 1 )\u2212\u2192H 2(i\u22121) ((\u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb )S 1 ),\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere p and q are natural inclusions.

Note that p\u2217 (f + )\u2217 (\u03b7 i\u22121 ) =\nBy definition of ci , we have I(\u03a6\n\n(f \u2212 )\u2217 (\u03b7 i\u22121 ). Hence the exactness of (3.12) yields a \u03c3 \u2208 H 2(i\u22121) ((\u03a6ci +\u01eb )S 1 , (\u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb )S 1 ) such that\n\n\u02c6 ci +\u01eb ) \u2265 i, we have (f + )\u2217 (\u03b7 i\u22121 ) 6= 0. Hence \u03c3 6= 0, and then\nq \u2217 (\u03c3) = (f + )\u2217 (\u03b7 i\u22121 ). Since I(\u03a6\n2(i\u22121)\n\nHS 1\n\n(\u03a6ci +\u01eb , \u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb ) = H 2(i\u22121) ((\u03a6ci +\u01eb )S 1 , (\u03a6ci \u2212\u01eb )S 1 ) 6= 0.\n\nNow the proposition follows from (3.11) and the universal coefficient theorem.\nProposition 3.6. Suppose u is the critical point of \u03a6 found in Proposition 3.5.

Fix this u, we modify the function H only in a small neighborhood \u03a9 of 0 as in [Eke1]\ne satisfies similar\nso that the corresponding orbit of u does not enter \u03a9 and the resulted function H\n\nproperties as Definition 1 in P. 26 of [Eke1] by just replacing\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u22121\n\ne :L\nfunctional \u03a6\n0\n\n(S 1 , R2n ) \u2192 R by\ne\n\u03a6(v)\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1 \u00121\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\nthere by \u03b1.

Then by the continuity of critical modules (cf.\nsince clearly \u03a6 and \u03a6\n\nTheorem 8.8 of [MaW1] or Theorem 1.5.6 in P.53 of [Cha1], which can be easily generalized to the\nequivariant sense) for the u in the proposition, we have\ne S 1 * u).\nCS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a6, S 1 * u) \u223c\n= CS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a6,\n\n(3.15)\n\ne S 1 * u) \u223c\ne\ne\nCS 1 , \u2217 (\u03a6,\n\u2229 D\u03b9 N (u), (\u039b(u)\n\\ {u}) \u2229 D\u03b9 N (u))Zm ,\n= H\u2217 (\u039b(u)\n\n(3.16)\n\nUsing a finite dimensional approximation as in Lemma 3.9 of [Eke1], we have\n\n\u03b1\n\ne\ne\ne\nwhere \u039b(u)\n= {w \u2208 L0\u03b1\u22121 (S 1 , R2n ) | \u03a6(w)\n\u2264 \u03a6(u)}\nand D\u03b9 N (u) is a Zm -invariant finite dimensional\n\ndisk transversal to S 1 * u at u (cf.

Hence we can assume Ha = H in\ne coincide in a L\u221e a L\u221e -neighborhood of S 1 * u and then the above conclusion. Hence \u03a8a and \u03a6\n\nneighborhood of S 1 *u.

By the assumption (F) at the beginning of Section 2, we denote\nby {(\u03c4j , yj )}1\u2264j\u2264k all the geometrically distinct closed characteristics on \u03a3, and by \u03b3j \u2261 \u03b3yj the\nassociated symplectic path of (\u03c4j , yj ) on \u03a3 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Then by Lemma 15.2.4 of [Lon4], there\nexist Pj \u2208 Sp(6) and Mj \u2208 Sp(4) such that\n\u03b3j (\u03c4j ) = Pj\u22121 (N1 (1, 1)\u22c4Mj )Pj ,\n1\n\nb\n\n!\n\n\u2200 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\n\n(3.19)\n\nfor b \u2208 R.\n0 1\nWithout loss of generality, by Theorem 1.3 of [LoZ1] (cf. Theorem 15.5.2 of [Lon4]), we may\n\nwhere recall N1 (1, b) =\n\nassume that (\u03c41 , y1 ) has irrational mean index. Hence by Theorem 8.3.1 and Corollary 8.3.2 of\n13\n\n\f[Lon4], M1 \u2208 Sp(4) in (3.19) can be connected to R(\u03b81 )\u22c4Q1 within \u03a90 (M1 ) for some \u03b8\u03c01 \u2208\n/ Q and\n!\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nQ1 \u2208 Sp(2), where R(\u03b8) =\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 R. Here we use notations from Definition\nsin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8\n1.8.5 and Theorem 1.8.10 of [Lon4]. By Theorem 2.7, the following identity holds\nX \u03c7\u0302(yj )\n1\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 )\n+\n= .\n2\n\u00ee(y1 ) 2\u2264j\u2264k \u00ee(yj )\n\n(3.20)\n\nNow we have the following four cases according to the classification of basic norm forms (cf. Definition 1.8.9 of [Lon4]).\nCase 1. Q1 = R(\u03b82 ) with\n\n\u03b82\n\u03c0\n\n\u2208\n/ Q or Q1 = D(\u00b12) \u2261\n\n\u00b12\n\n0\n\n!\n\n.\n0 \u00b1 12\nIn this case, by Theorems 8.1.6 and 8.1.7 of [Lon4], we have \u03bd(y1m ) \u2261 1, i.e., y1m is non-degenerate\n\nfor all m \u2208 N. Hence it follows from (2.15) that \u03c7\u0302(y1 ) 6= 0. Now (3.20) implies that at least one of\nthe yj 's for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 k must have irrational mean index. Hence the theorem holds.\nCase 2. Q1 = N1 (1, b) with b = \u00b11, 0.\nWe have two subcases according to the value of \u03c7\u0302(y1 ).\nSubcase 2.1. \u03c7\u0302(y1 ) 6= 0.\nIn this case, (3.20) implies that at least one of the yj 's for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 k must have irrational mean\nindex. Hence the theorem holds.\nSubcase 2.2. \u03c7\u0302(y1 ) = 0.\nNote that by Theorems 8.1.4 and 8.1.7 of [Lon4] and our above Proposition 2.5, we have K(y1 ) =\n1. Since \u03bd(y1 ) \u2264 3, it follows from Proposition 2.6 and (2.14):\n0 = \u03c7\u0302(y1 ) = (\u22121)i(y1 ) (k0 (y1 ) \u2212 k1 (y1 ) + k2 (y1 )).\n\n(3.21)\n\nBy (iv) of Proposition 2.6, at most one of kl (y1 ) for l = 0, 1, 2 can be nonzero. Then (3.21) yields\nkl (y1 ) = 0 for l = 0, 1, 2. Hence it follows from Proposition 2.3 and Definition 2.4 that\nCS 1 , q (\u03a8a , S 1 * up1 ) = 0,\n\n\u2200p \u2208 N, q \u2208 Z,\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere we denote by u1 the critical point of \u03a8a corresponding to (\u03c41 , y1 ). In other words, um\n1 is\nhomologically invisible for all m \u2208 N.\nBy Propositions 3.5 and 3.6, we can replace the term infinite variationally visible in Definition\n1.4 of [LoZ1] (cf. Definition 15.3.3 of [Lon4]) by homologically visible, and it is easy to check that all\nthe results in [LoZ1] remain true under this change. Hence by Theorem 1.3 of [LoZ1] (cf. Theorem\n15.5.2 of [Lon4]), at least one of the yj 's for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 k must have irrational mean index, i.e., we can\nforget y1 and consider only yj 's for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 k, then apply that theorem. This proves our theorem.\n14\n\n\fCase 3. Q1 = N1 (\u22121, 1).\nIn this case, by Theorems 8.1.4, 8.1.5 and 8.1.7 of [Lon4], we have\ni(y1 , m) = mi(y1 , 1) + 2E\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03b81\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 2,\n\n\u03bd(y1 , m) = 1 +\n\n1 + (\u22121)m\n,\n2\n\n\u2200m \u2208 N,\n\nwith i(y1 , 1) \u2208 2Z + 1. Hence K(y1 ) = 2 by Proposition 2.5. Because y1 is non-degenerate, we\nhave kl (y1 ) = \u03b40l for all l \u2208 Z by (2.11), (2.13) and Definition 2.4. By Theorem 3.2, we have\n\ni(y1 ) = i(y1 , 1) \u2212 3 \u2208 2Z and i(y12 ) \u2212 i(y1 ) = i(y1 , 2) \u2212 i(y1 , 1) \u2208 2Z + 1. Hence k0 (y12 ) = 0 by (v) of\nProposition 2.6. Because \u03bd(y12 ) = 2, we have kl (y12 ) = 0 for l \u2265 2. Then (2.14) implies\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) =\n\n1 + k1 (y12 )\n6= 0.\n2\n\nNow (3.20) implies that at least one of the yj 's for 2 \u2264 j \u2264 k must have irrational mean index.\nHence the theorem holds.\nCase 4. Q1 = N1 (\u22121, b) with b = 0, \u22121 or Q1 = R(\u03b82 ) with\n\n\u03b82\n2\u03c0\n\n=\n\nL\nN\n\n\u2208 Q \u2229 (0, 1) with N > 1\n\nand (L, N ) = 1.\nNote first that if Q1 = N1 (\u22121, b) with b = 0, \u22121, then Theorems 8.1.5 and 8.1.7 of [Lon4]\nimply that their index iteration formulae coincide with that of a rotational matrix R(\u03b8) with \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nHence in the following we shall only consider the case Q1 = R(\u03b82 ) with \u03b82 /\u03c0 \u2208 (0, 2) \u2229 Q. The\nsame argument also shows that the theorem is true for Q1 = N1 (\u22121, \u22121).\nBy Theorems 8.1.4 and 8.1.7 of [Lon4], we have\ni(y1 , m) = m(i(y1 , 1) \u2212 1) + 2E\n\u03bd(y1 , m) = 3 \u2212 2\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nm\u03b82\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03b81\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n+ 2E\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03b82\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 3,\n\n(3.23)\n(3.24)\n\nwith i(y1 , 1) \u2208 2Z + 1 and all m \u2208 N. By Proposition 2.5, we have K(y1 ) = N . Note that because\ny1m is non-degenerate for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u2212 1, kl (y1m ) = \u03b40l holds for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u2212 1 by (2.11), (2.13)\n\nand Definition 2.4. By Theorem 3.2, we have i(y1 ) = i(y1 , 1) \u2212 3 \u2208 2Z.

Thus (3.41)-(3.42) hold and\n\n(3.39)-(3.40) hold for m 6= 2m1 by Proposition 2.3.

Hence p 6= q by (3.43)\nand (3.44). Then the proof of Lemma 3.1 in [LoZ1](cf. lemma 15.3.5 of [Lon4]) yields\n\u00ee(yp , 2mp ) < \u00ee(yq , 2mq ).\n\n(3.45)\n\nNow if both \u00ee(yp ) \u2208 Q and \u00ee(yq ) \u2208 Q hold, then the proof of Theorem 5.3 in [LoZ1](cf. Theorem\n15.5.2 of [Lon4]) yields\n\u00ee(yp , 2mp ) = \u00ee(yq , 2mq ).\nNote that we may choose T firstly such that\n\nT\nM \u00ee(yj )\n\n\u2208 N hold for all \u00ee(yj ) \u2208 Q then use the proof\n\nof Theorem 5.3 in [LoZ1].

Hence either \u00ee(yp ) \u2208\n/ Q or \u00ee(yq ) \u2208\n/ Q holds. This\n\ntogether with \u00ee(y1 ) \u2208\n/ Q and p, q 6= 1 proves the theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. We denote by {(\u03c4j , yj )}1\u2264j\u22643 the three geometrically distinct closed\ncharacteristics on \u03a3, and by \u03b3j \u2261 \u03b3yj the associated symplectic path of (\u03c4j , yj ) on \u03a3 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 3.\nThen as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, there exist Pj \u2208 Sp(6) and Mj \u2208 Sp(4) such that\n\u03b3j (\u03c4j ) = Pj\u22121 (N1 (1, 1)\u22c4Mj )Pj ,\n\n\u2200 1 \u2264 j \u2264 3.\n\n(3.46)\n\nAs in P.356 of [LoZ1], if there is no (\u03c4j , yj ) with Mj = N1 (1, \u22121)\u22c42 and i(yj , 1) = 3 in V\u221e (\u03a3, \u03b1),\nthen \u033an (\u03a3) = 3. Hence we can use Theorem 1.4 of [LoZ1] (Theorem 15.5.2 of [Lon4]) to obtain the\nexistence of at least two elliptic closed characteristics. This proves the theorem.\nIt remains to show that if there exists a (\u03c4j , yj ) with Mj = N1 (1, \u22121)\u22c42 and i(yj , 1) = 3 in\n\nV\u221e (\u03a3, \u03b1), we have at least two elliptic closed characteristics. We may assume M1 = N1 (1, \u22121)\u22c42\n\nand i(y1 , 1) = 3 without loss of generality. Note that (\u03c41 , y1 ) has rational mean index by Theorem\n8.3.1 of [Lon4] and Theorem 3.2.\nBy Theorem 1.3 of [LoZ1], we may assume that (\u03c42 , y2 ) has irrational mean index. Hence by\nTheorem 8.3.1 and Corollary 8.3.2 of [Lon4], M2 \u2208 Sp(4) in (3.46) can be connected !to R(\u03b82 )\u22c4Q2\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 R.\nwithin \u03a90 (M2 ) for some \u03b8\u03c02 \u2208 R \\ Q and Q2 \u2208 Sp(2), where R(\u03b8) =\nsin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8\nHere we use notations from Definition 1.8.5 and Theorem 1.8.10 of [Lon4]. By Theorem 2.7, the\nfollowing identity holds\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) \u03c7\u0302(y2 ) \u03c7\u0302(y3 )\n1\n+\n+\n= .\n(3.47)\n2\n\u00ee(y1 )\n\u00ee(y2 )\n\u00ee(y3 )\nNow if Q2 is not hyperbolic, then both (\u03c41 , y1 ) and (\u03c42 , y2 ) are elliptic, so the theorem holds.\nHence it remains to consider the case that Q2 is hyperbolic. Clearly (\u03c42 , y2 ) is non-degenerate,\nthen it follows from (2.15) that \u03c7\u0302(y2 ) 6= 0. Hence (3.47) implies that \u00ee(y3 ) \u2208 R \\ Q. Now by\nTheorem 8.3.1 and Corollary 8.3.2 of [Lon4], M3 \u2208 Sp(4) in (3.46) can be connected to R(\u03b83 )\u22c4Q3\n\nwithin \u03a90 (M3 ) for some\n\n\u03b83\n\u03c0\n\n\u2208 R \\ Q and Q3 \u2208 Sp(2). By the same reason as above, it suffices to\n\nconsider the case that Q3 is hyperbolic.\nCombining all the above, the only case we need to kick off is that\nM1 = N1 (1, \u22121)\u22c42 ,\n\ni(y1 , 1) = 3,\n\nM2 = R(\u03b82 ) \u22c4 Q2 ,\n\nM3 = R(\u03b83 ) \u22c4 Q3 ,\n\n(3.48)\n\nwhere both Q2 and Q3 are hyperbolic. Hence by Theorem 8.3.1 of [Lon4] and Theorem 3.2, we\nhave\ni(y1m ) = m(i(y1 , 1) + 1) \u2212 4 = 4m \u2212 4, \u03bd(y1m ) = 3, \u2200m \u2208 N,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\u03b8j\nm\n\u2212 5, \u03bd(yjm ) = 1, \u2200m \u2208 N, j = 2, 3.\ni(yj ) = m(i(yj ) + 3) + 2E\n2\u03c0\n18\n\n(3.49)\n(3.50)\n\n\fBy Proposition 2.5, we have K(y1 ) = 1. Note that i(y1 ) = i(y1 , 1) \u2212 3 = 0 by Theorem 3.2. Hence\nProposition 2.6, (2.14) and (2.15) imply\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) \u2264 1,\n\u03c7\u0302(yj ) =\n\n(\n\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) \u2208 Z,\n\u22121, if i(yj ) \u2208 2N0 + 1,\n1\n2,\n\nif i(yj ) \u2208 2N0 ,\n\n(3.51)\nj = 1, 2.\n\n(3.52)\n\nBy (3.49) and (3.50), we have\n\u00ee(y1 ) = 4,\n\n(3.53)\n\n\u00ee(yj ) = i(yj ) + 3 +\n\n\u03b8j\n> 3,\n\u03c0\n\nj = 2, 3.\n\n(3.54)\n\nBy (3.51)-(3.54), in order to make (3.47) hold, we must have\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) = 1,\n\n(3.55)\n\ni(yj ) \u2208 2N0 ,\n\nj = 2, 3.\n\n(3.56)\n\nIn fact, by (3.52) and (3.54), we have\n\u03c7\u0302(y2 ) \u03c7\u0302(y3 )\n1 1\n1\n+\n< + < .\n6\n6\n2\n\u00ee(y2 )\n\u00ee(y3 )\nThus to make (3.47) hold, we must have\n\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 )\n\u00ee(y1 )\n\n> 0. Hence (3.55) follows from (3.51). Now if\n\ni(y2 ) \u2208 2N0 + 1 or i(y3 ) \u2208 2N0 + 1 holds, then by (3.52), we have\n\u03c7\u0302(y1 ) \u03c7\u0302(y2 ) \u03c7\u0302(y3 )\n1 1\n1\n+\n+\n< + < .\n4\n6\n2\n\u00ee(y1 )\n\u00ee(y2 )\n\u00ee(y3 )\nHence (3.56) must hold.\nBy (2.14), (3.49) and (3.55), we have 1 = \u03c7\u0302(y1 ) = k0 (y1 ) \u2212 k1 (y1 ) + k2 (y1 ). Since \u03bd(y1 ) = 3, by\nProposition 2.6, only one of k0 (y1 ), k1 (y1 ), k2 (y1 ) can be nonzero. Hence we obtain\nk1 (y1 ) = 0,\n\nk0 (y1 ) + k2 (y1 ) = 1,\n\n(3.57)\n\n\u2200p \u2208 N, q \u2208 2Z + 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 3.\n\n(3.58)\n\nBy Proposition 2.3, we have\nCS 1 , q (\u03a8a , S 1 * upj ) = 0,\n\nIn fact, by (3.49), we have i(y1m ) \u2208 2N for all m \u2208 N. Thus (3.58) holds for j = 1 by (2.11), (3.57)\n\nand Definition 2.4. By (3.50) and (3.56), for j = 2, 3, we have i(yjm ) \u2208 2N when m \u2208 2N0 + 1 and\n\ni(yjm ) \u2208 2N0 + 1 when m \u2208 2N. In particular, all yjm are non-degenerate for m \u2208 N and j = 2, 3.\nThus (3.58) holds for j = 2, 3 by (2.13).\n19\n\n\fNote that (3.58) implies\nMq = 0,\n\n\u2200q \u2208 2Z + 1.\n\n(3.59)\n\nTogether with the Morse inequality Theorem 2.8, it yields\n\u2212M2k \u2212 * * * \u2212 M2 \u2212 M0 \u2265 \u2212b2k \u2212 * * * \u2212 b2 \u2212 b0 .\nThus together with the Morse inequality again, it yields\nb2k + * * * + b2 + b0 \u2265 M2k + * * * + M2 + M0 \u2265 b2k + * * * + b2 + b0 ,\nfor all k \u2265 0.
