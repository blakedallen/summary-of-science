Gelfond and Khovanskii found a formula for the sum of the values\nof a Laurent polynomial over the zeros of a system of n Laurent polynomials in\n(C \\ 0)n . We expect that a similar formula holds in the case of exponential sums\nwith real frequencies. Here we prove such a formula in dimension 1.\n\n1. Introduction\nO. Gelfond and A. Khovanskii found a formula for the sum of the values of a\nLaurent polynomial g over the zeros of a system\nf1 (z) = * * * = fn (z) = 0,\n\nz \u2208 (C \\ 0)n ,\n\nwhere fi are Laurent polynomials whose Newton polyhedra have generic relative\npositions [1, 2]. After an exponential change of variables we obtain a similar formula\nwhere g and the fi are now exponential sums with rational frequencies. There is a\nlot of evidence that this formula continues to hold if the frequencies are real. For\nexample, when g = 1 the formula follows from combining two results: Gelfond's\ngeneralization of Bernstein's theorem [4] and the new formula for mixed volume [5].\nIn [8] the formula is proved in the case when the frequencies of the exponential sum\ng are not commensurate with the frequencies of the system.\nHere we prove the generalization of the Gelfond\u2013Khovanskii formula to exponential sums with real frequencies in dimension one. Our argument is elementary.\nA similar result is obtained by J. Ritt in [7], where he computes the average sum\nof the real parts of zeros of an exponential sum. Ritt's result can be considered\nas an exponential generalization of the Vieta formula for the product of zeros of a\npolynomial.\nThis paper is a part of the author's Ph.D. thesis.

Algebraic case\nRecall that a Laurent polynomial f in one complex variable z is a finite linear\ncombination of monomials with integer exponents:\nX\nf (z) =\nck z k , k \u2208 Z, ck \u2208 C.\nk\n\nWe explain how to compute explicitly the sum of the values of a Laurent polynomial\ng over the zeros of a Laurent polynomial f in C \\ {0}, counting multiplicities. Our\nargument in the exponential case is a generalization of the argument that we present\nhere.\nConsider a differential form \u03c9 = g df /f . This form has simple poles at the zeros\nzi of f with the residue equal to \u03bci g(zi ) where \u03bci is the multiplicity of the root zi .\nSince the sum of the residues of \u03c9 is zero, the sum of the values of g over the zeros\nof f in C \\ {0} is equal to \u2212res\u221e \u03c9 \u2212 res0 \u03c9.\nTo compute these residues, we expand gf \u2032 /f into Laurent series as follows. Let\nf (z) = c1 z k1 + * * * + cn z kn , k1 < * * * < kn , ki \u2208 Z.\nPut fe = f /c1 z k1 . Since fe\u2212 1 contains only positive powers of z , we have |fe\u2212 1| < 1\nin a neighborhood of zero. Therefore, we can expand 1/fe into series converging\nuniformly in this neighborhood:\n1/fe = 1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + * * * .\n\nSince each power of z appears in this series finitely many times, it is a well-defined\nseries in z . Multiplying this series by gf \u2032 /c1 z k1 we obtain a series for gf \u2032 /f :\ngf \u2032\ngf \u2032\n=\n(1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + * * * ).\nf\nc1 z k1\nTherefore, the residue at zero is equal to the coefficient A1 of 1/z in this series.\nSimilarly, denote by An the coefficient of 1/z in the series\ngf \u2032\n(1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + * * * ),\ncn z kn\n\nwhere this time fe = f /cn z kn . Then the residue at infinity is equal to \u2212An .\nTherefore, the sum of the values of g over the zeros of f in C \\ {0} is equal to\nAn \u2212 A1 .\n3. Statement of result\nWe are going to deal with exponential sums with real frequencies, i.e. functions\nof the form\nf (z) = c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z + * * * + cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z,\nwhere the coefficients ci are nonzero complex numbers and the frequencies \u03b1i are\nincreasing real numbers: \u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1n . If we factor out c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z from f , the\nrest will be close to infinity as Re z \u2192 \u221e and close to 1 as Re z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Therefore, all\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL GELFOND-KHOVANSKII FORMULA IN DIMENSION ONE\n\n3\n\nthe zeros of f lie in the vertical strip |Re z| < B for some B , where the choice of B\ndepends only on the frequencies \u03b1i and the absolute values of the coefficients ci .\nLet g be an exponential sum with real frequencies. We want to add up the values\nof g over the zeros of f . Since the number of zeros is infinite, the sum over the\nzeros must be replaced with the result of averaging g over the zeros of f along the\nimaginary axis. More precisely, let S(R) be the sum of the values of g over those\nzeros of f (counting multiplicities) whose absolute value of the imaginary part is\nless than R. Since all the zeros of f belong to the vertical strip |Re z| < B , this\nsum is finite.\nDefinition 3.1. The mean value of g over the zeros of f is the limit\nS(R)\n.\nM = lim\nR\u2192\u221e 2R\nIf g = 1, M is the mean number of zeros of f .\nLet fe = f /ck exp 2\u03c0\u03b1k z , where k is either 1 or n. The constant term of the\nexponential sum fe is equal to one, thus we can define the exponential series for 1/fe\nby the formula\n1/fe = 1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + * * * .\nSince each exponent exp 2\u03c0\u03b1z appears with a nonzero coefficient in a finite number\nof terms, the coefficients of these series are well-defined. Let Ak be the constant\nterm in the formal product of this series and gf \u2032 /ck exp(2\u03c0\u03b1k z) for k = 1, n.\nThe following theorem is the generalization of the Gelfond\u2013Khovanskii formula to\nthe case of exponential sums in dimension one.\nTheorem 3.2. Let f be an exponential sum with real frequencies:\nf (z) = c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z + * * * + cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z,\n\n\u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1n .\n\nLet g be another exponential sum with real frequencies. Then the mean value M of\ng over the zeros of f is equal to\nAn \u2212 A1\n,\n2\u03c0\nwhere An and A1 are defined above. In particular, the mean number of zeros of f ,\nis equal to \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 .\nFurthermore, the mean value of g = exp 2\u03c0\u03b1z over the zeros of f can only be\nnonzero if \u03b1 belongs either to the non-positive semigroup A generated by the set\n{\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b1i | i = 1 . . . n}, or to the non-negative semigroup B generated by the set\n{\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1i | i = 1 . . . n}.\n4.

Denote the corresponding sides of \u0393R by \u03b3+ , \u03b3R , \u03b3\u2212 , and \u03b3\u2212R (see Figure 4.1).\nThe proof of Theorem 3.2 will be divided in two parts between the following two\nsections as follows:\n(1) We show that the integral over the horizontal part of \u0393R is bounded as\nR \u2192 \u221e, and consequently only the integrals over the vertical segments\ncontribute to the mean value.\n(2) We compute the contribution to the mean value of the integrals over the\nvertical segments.\n5. The integral over the horizontal part of \u0393R is bounded\nFor each zero of the exponential sum f (z) = c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z + * * * + cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z we\ndelete from |Re z| \u2264 B an open disk of radius r > 0 centered at that zero, and call\nthe resulting region Df . In the lemma below we show that f is separated from 0\non Df .\nLemma 5.1. For Df defined above there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for all z \u2208 Df\n|f (z)| \u2265 \u03b4 > 0.\nProof. Let F be the family of exponential sums that have the same frequencies \u03b1i\nas f , and each of its coefficients di has the same absolute value as the corresponding\nci in f . That is, each h \u2208 F is of the form\nh(z) = d1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z + * * * + dn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z,\nwhere |di | = |ci |. This family is invariant under translations along the imaginary\naxis. Due to our choice of B , all the zeros of each of the functions in F belong to\n|Re z| < B .\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL GELFOND-KHOVANSKII FORMULA IN DIMENSION ONE\n\n5\n\nFor each element h of F we define Dh to be the strip |Re z| \u2264 B with deleted\nopen disks of radius r centered at the zeros of h. Let\n\u03b4h = min |h(z)|,\nz\u2208Dh\n\n\u03b4 = inf \u03b4h .\nh\u2208F\n\nWe need to show that \u03b4 > 0.\nAssume \u03b4 = 0. It means that there exist a sequence of functions hl \u2208 F and a\nsequence of points zl \u2208 Dhl such that hl (zl ) \u2192 0, as l \u2192 \u221e. Since F is invariant\nunder translations along the imaginary axis, we can assume that all zl belong to the\ncompact set\nV = {|Re z| \u2264 B, |Im z| \u2264 1}.\nEach h \u2208 F can be identified with the collection of its coefficients (d1 , . . . , dn ) \u2208 Cn .\nThen the convergence in Cn corresponds to the uniform convergence on V . The\nfamily F is a product of n circles and, therefore, is a compact set.\nConsider the sequence (hl , zl ) in F \u00d7 V . Since F \u00d7 V is compact, we can assume\n(choosing a subsequence if necessary) that the sequence (hl , zl ) converges to some\n(h, z0 ) \u2208 F \u00d7V . This means that zl converges to z0 , and hl converges to h uniformly\non V . Since hl (zl ) \u2192 0, we have h(z0 ) = 0.\nBy the Hurwitz theorem, each function hl with l big enough has a zero in the\ndisk {|z \u2212 z0 | < \u03c1} \u2282 {|Re z| \u2264 B} with \u03c1 < r/2. Therefore, we can find l such that\nzl belongs to the disk and hl has a zero in this disk. But then the distance between\nzl and this zero of hl is less than r , which contradicts zl \u2208 Dhl .\nThis contradiction proves that \u03b4 > 0.\n\u0003\nWe will need the following result from the theory of fewnomials, which is a consequence of the complex Rolle theorem.\nTheorem 5.2. [6] Let f be an exponential sum of the form\nf (z) = c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z + * * * + cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z,\nwhere the coefficients ci are complex numbers and the frequencies \u03b1i are increasing\nreal numbers: \u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1n . Then f has less than n zeros in a horizontal strip of\nwidth less than 1/(\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 ).\nRecall that \u03b3R \u222a \u03b3\u2212R is the horizontal part of the contour \u0393R .\nLemma 5.3. The absolute value of the integral\nZ\ngf \u2032\ndz\n\u03b3R f\nis bounded for all R such that there are no zeros of f on \u03b3R .\nProof. Choose r < 1/4n(\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 ). For each zero of f delete an open disk of radius\nr centered at that zero. The projection of these deleted disks to the imaginary axis\ndoes not entirely cover the vertical segment\no\nn\n1\n.\nRe z = 0, Im z \u2212 R <\n4(\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 )\n\n\f6\n\nEVGENIA SOPRUNOVA\n\nIndeed, the only disks whose projections could touch this segment are the ones whose\ncenter z satisfies\n1\nIm z \u2212 R <\n.\n2 (\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 )\nBy Theorem 5.2, there are less than n such disks. Hence the length of the projection\nis less than 2rn < 1/2 (\u03b1n \u2212\u03b11 ), which is equal to the length of the vertical segment.\nTherefore, we can choose R\u2032 on this segment so that \u03b3R\u2032 does not meet the deleted\ndisks. Since by Lemma 5.1 f is separated from zero on \u03b3R\u2032 , the integral over R\u2032 is\nbounded.\nIt remains to show that the difference of the integrals over \u03b3R and \u03b3R\u2032 is bounded.\nConsider the contour \u03b3 formed by \u03b3R , \u03b3R\u2032 , and the vertical segments connecting\ntheir endpoints. The integral over \u03b3 is equal to the sum of the values of g over the\nzeros of f that lie inside \u03b3 , times 2\u03c0i. This sum is bounded since f has less than\nn zeros inside, and g is bounded on |Re z| < B . Choosing B so big that all the\nzeros of f belong to |Re z| < B/2, and requiring that r < B/2, we ensure that\nthe deleted disks do not intersect the vertical part of \u03b3 , and the integral over the\nvertical segments is bounded. We proved that the integral\nZ\ngf \u2032\ndz\n\u03b3R f\nis bounded.\n\n\u0003\n\nThis lemma implies that\n1\nlim\nR\u2192\u221e 4\u03c0iR\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3R\n\ngf \u2032\ndz = 0.\nf\n\nTherefore, only the integrals over the vertical part of \u0393R can contribute to the mean\nvalue.\n6. The integral over the vertical part of \u0393R .\nHere we explain how to compute the limit\nZ\ngf \u2032\n1\ndz,\nlim\nR\u2192\u221e 4\u03c0iR\nf\nwhere the integration is performed over the vertical part of \u0393R .\nWe deal with \u03b3\u2212 first. Recall that f (z) = c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z +* * *+cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z , where\n\u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1n . Let fe = f /c1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z . Then the constant term of fe is equal to 1.\nOn Re z = \u2212B ,\n|fe \u2212 1| =\n\nn\nX\ncj\nj=2\n\nc1\n\nexp 2\u03c0(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b11 )z \u2264\n\nn\nX\n|cj |\nj=2\n\n|c1 |\n\nexp(\u22122B\u03c0(\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b11 )),\n\n\fEXPONENTIAL GELFOND-KHOVANSKII FORMULA IN DIMENSION ONE\n\n7\n\nwhich is less than 1 if B is big enough since \u03b1j > \u03b11 . Therefore, we can expand\ngf \u2032 /f into geometric series converging uniformly on Re z = \u2212B :\n\u0010\n\u0011\nf\u2032\nf\u2032\ng =g\n1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + . . . ,\nf\nc1 exp 2\u03c0\u03b11 z\n\nwhich is a series in exponents, since every exponent appears only finitely many times.\nWe integrate this series over \u03b3\u2212 , divide by 4\u03c0iR and find the limit as R \u2192 \u221e termby-term.\nNotice that only the constant term in this series can give a nonzero limit. If this\nconstant term is A1 , then the corresponding limit is \u2212A1 /2\u03c0 . If g(z) = exp 2\u03c0\u03b1z ,\nthen the only values of \u03b1 for which there is a nonzero constant term in the series\nare those that belong to the non-positive semigroup A generated by {\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b1i | i =\n1, . . . , n}.\nIt remains to repeat this procedure for \u03b3+ . Let fe = f /cn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z , and expand\ngf \u2032 /f into exponential series converging uniformly on Re z = B :\n\u0010\n\u0011\ngf \u2032\ngf \u2032\n1 + (1 \u2212 fe) + (1 \u2212 fe)2 + . . . .\n=\nf\ncn exp 2\u03c0\u03b1n z\nIf the constant term of this series is An , then the corresponding limit is An /2\u03c0 . If\ng(z) = exp 2\u03c0\u03b1z , then the only values of \u03b1 for which there is a nonzero constant\nterm in the series are those that belong to the non-negative semigroup B generated\nby {\u03b1n \u2212 \u03b1i | i = 1, . . . , n}.\nWe proved that the mean value M of g over the zeros of f is equal to\n\nAn \u2212 A1\n.\n2\u03c0\nIf g = 1, it is easy to see that An = 2\u03c0\u03b1n and A1 = 2\u03c0\u03b11 . Hence the mean number\nof zeros of f is equal to \u03b1n \u2212 \u03b11 .\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nO. Gelfond, A.
