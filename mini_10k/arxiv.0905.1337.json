That mass can either be explicit or dynamical in origin. Since the theory is super-renormalisable, it has a\nwell-defined chiral limit and therefore admits the possibility and study of dynamical mass generation. This\nincreases its quantitative similarity with QCD because\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) explains\n[3] the origin of constituent-quark masses and underlies\nthe success of chiral effective field theory. In parallel\nwith its relevance as a tool through which to develop insight into aspects of QCD, QED3 is also of interest in\ncondensed matter physics as an effective field theory for\nhigh-temperature superconductors [4, 5, 6] and graphene\n[7, 8].\nA perspective on confinement is laid out in Refs. [3,\n9, 10, 11], which explain that a sufficient condition for\nthe confinement of a given elementary excitation is the\nabsence of a K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann representation for the associated 2-point Schwinger function. In the noncompact\nformulation of QED3 there are indications that fermion\nconfinement and DCSB go hand-in-hand [12, 13].1\nA fascination with this stems from an anticipation that\n\nQED3 possesses a critical number of flavours, Nfc , above\nwhich DCSB, and therefore confinement, is impossible\n[15]. This feature makes the theory interesting as a\ntool with which to explore technicolour extensions of the\nStandard Model [16] and possibly relevant to the phase\ndiagram of QCD in the plane formed by the coupling and\nthe number of quark flavours; e.g., Ref. [17, 18].\nThe study of lattice-regularised QED3 suggests Nfc > 1\n[19], with a recent simulation hinting at Nfc \u223c 1.5 [20].\nThe latter is curious because it was argued in Ref. [21]\nthat Nfc \u2264 3/2, although this constraint has been challenged [22]. However, in connection with lattice simulations it should be noted that an impediment to reliable\nresults is the mass hierarchy feature of QED3; viz., any\ndynamically generated mass-scale is at least one order of\nmagnitude smaller than the natural scale, which is set\nby the dimensioned coupling e2 (see, e.g., Ref. [23]).2 As\none would readily anticipate, this accentuates the impact\nof finite volume artefacts and can lead to underestimation of Nfc because the signal for DCSB is lost once the\nmagnitude of this effect falls below 1/L, where L is the\nlattice length-scale [24].\nIt was recently demonstrated [13] that noncompact\nQED3 can possess a critical number of flavours if, and\nonly if, the fermion wave function renormalisation and\nphoton vacuum polarisation are homogeneous functions\nat infrared momenta when the fermion mass function\nvanishes. The Ward identity entails that the fermion-\n\n2\n1\n\nFeatures of confinement in the gauge sector of a compact formulation of QED3 are discussed, e.g., in Ref. [14].\n\nThis is not the case for QCD, which possesses a dimensionless\nrunning coupling that evolves with respect to a mass-scale whose\nmagnitude is characteristic of all dynamically generated massdimensioned quantities in the theory.\n\n\f2\nphoton vertex possesses the same property and ensures\na simple relationship between the homogeneity degrees\nof each of these functions. These exact results were illustrated using a simple model for the photon vacuum\npolarisation and one for the fermion-photon vertex. The\nexistence and value of Nfc are naturally contingent upon\nthe precise form of the vertex.\nIt was also argued that should a critical number of\nflavours exist, then any discussion of its gauge dependence is moot because Landau gauge occupies a special place in gauge theories. It is the gauge in which\nany sound Ansatz for the fermion-photon vertex can\nmost reasonably be described as providing a pointwise accurate approximation. The vertex in any other\ngauge should then be defined as the Landau-KhalatnikovFradkin (LKF) transform [25, 26, 27, 28] of the Landau\ngauge Ansatz. The sensible implementation of this procedure guarantees gauge covariance and hence obviates\nany question about the gauge dependence of gauge invariant quantities. However, as we shall see, a deft hand\nis necessary when employing the LKF transformations.\nWe return to the study of QED3 in order to demonstrate gauge invariance in connection with the critical\nnumber of flavours for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration. Notably, these transitions are coincident\nin Landau gauge [13] and that should not change following a gauge transformation. We recapitulate on those\naspects of QED3 necessary for our discussion in Sec. II;\ndescribe and explain our findings in Sec. III; and provide\na summary and perspective in Sec. IV.\n\nwhere, with q\u00b1 = q \u00b1 k/2,\n\u22121\nD\u03bc\u03bd\n(k) = [\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (1 \u2212 1/\u03be)k\u03bc k\u03bd ] + \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (k),\n(5)\n\u0003\n\u0002 2\n2\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (k) = k \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 k\u03bc k\u03bd \u03a0(k) =: T\u03bc\u03bd (k) k \u03a0(k), (6)\nZ\nd3 q\ntr \u03b3\u03bc S(q+ )\u0393\u03bd (q+ , q\u2212 )S(q\u2212 ).\n= \u2212Nf e2\n(2\u03c0)3\n(7)\n\nWe observe that Landau gauge is obtained with \u03be = 0\nin the photon propagator; massless QED3 is straightforwardly defined by setting the Lagrangian mass m = 0;\nand the quenched theory is obtained by writing \u03a0(k) \u2261 0.\nFurthermore, as mentioned above, e2 in QED3 has unit\nmass-dimension and, without loss of generality [13], one\nmay work with e2 = 1. All mass-dimensioned quantities\nare then measured in terms of e2 .\nIn principle one can evaluate the chiral-limit fermion\npropagator to any finite order in perturbation theory. At\nO(\u03b12 ), \u03b1 = e2 /(4\u03c0), [29, 30]:\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u03c0\u03b1\n\u03c0\n3\u03b12 \u03c0 2\n7\n2 \u03b1\nA(p) = 1+\u03be\n, (8)\n+\u03be\n\u22121 \u2212 2\n\u2212\n4p\n4p2 4\n4p\n4\n3\nfrom which it is clear that there is no covariant gauge\nin which A(p) \u2261 1 is the fully nonperturbative solution. On the other hand, the choice of Landau gauge\nsuppresses the leading order contribution completely.3\nHence, Eq. (8) is most accurate for \u03be = 0, in which case\nwe anticipate that it is reliable for\n\u00151\n\u221a \u0014 2\np\n3 \u03c0\n7 2\n1\n\u226b\n\u2248\n\u2212\n.\n2\ne\n8\u03c0 4\n3\n40\n\nII.\n\nQED3 AND THE LKF TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nIn three dimensions it is possible to work with twocomponent spinors. However, in that formulation a mass\nterm of any origin is parity-odd. This problem may be\navoided by employing four-component spinors and a 4\u00d74\nrepresentation of the Clifford algebra: {\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd } = 2\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ;\ne.g., the set {\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b34 }, taken from four dimensional theories, with \u03b35 := \u2212\u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b34 . There are then two different\nmass terms; viz., \"m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8\" and \"m\u03c8\u0304 12 [\u03b33 , \u03b35 ]\u03c8.\" The former is analogous to the natural form in four dimensions\nand it is invariant under parity transformations. Hence\nwe use it to define the theory.\nThe study of confinement and DCSB can be pursued\nthrough the gap equations for the fermion and photon;\nnamely, in a theory with Nf fermions of mass m,\nS(p)\u22121 = i\u03b3 * p A(p) + B(p) ,\n= [i\u03b3 * p + M (p)]/Z(p) ,\n= i\u03b3 * p + m + \u03a3(p) ,\nZ\nd3 q\n2\nD\u03bc\u03bd (p \u2212 q)\u03b3\u03bc S(q)\u0393\u03bd (q, p) ,\n\u03a3(p) = e\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(9)\n\nThe accuracy deteriorates linearly with \u03be: in Feynman\ngauge, \u03be = 1, the series can only be reliable for p/e2 \u226b\n1/4. That these estimates are reliable is apparent, e.g.,\nfrom Ref. [23].\nFrom the configuration-space Landau-gauge fermion\npropagator one obtains the form in another covariant\ngauge through the LKF transformation\nS(z; \u03be) = S(z; \u03be = 0) e\u2212\u03c2|z| , \u03c2 = \u03be\n\ne2\n1\n= \u03be\u03b1 .\n8\u03c0\n2\n\n(10)\n\nThis expression, in combination with Eqs. (8), (9) and\nthe unquenched result [2, 13]: 0 \u2264 A(p = 0; \u03be = 0) < \u221e,\nhighlights a particular feature of Landau gauge: it is that\ncovariant gauge in which the infrared behaviour of the\nfermion propagator is neither enhanced nor suppressed\nby a non-dynamical gauge-dependent exponential factor.\nOwing to the mass-dimension of the coupling,\nthe gauge-dependent transformation parameter, \u03c2 in\n\n3\n\nIn Landau gauge the one-loop contribution to A(p) vanishes in\nany number of dimensions in any renormalisable gauge theory\n[31, 32].\n\n\f3\nEq. (10), also has unit mass dimension. Its scale is set\nby that of \u03b1, which is of the same magnitude or larger\nthan any dynamical mass scale the theory might generate. Confinement and DCSB are infrared effects; viz.,\nthey are apparent at a momentum-scale less than that\nwhich characterises a given theory. It is thus clear at the\noutset that \u03c2 can potentially mask these effects in any\ngauge other than \u03be = 0. However, as we shall see, it\ncannot destroy them: they will always be exposed in a\ncareful analysis.\nFor \u03be > 0 one can convert Eq. (10) into a practical\ntransformation of the fermion propagator in momentum\nspace; i.e., from a Landau gauge solution\nS(p) = \u2212i\u03b3 * p \u03c3V (p2 ; \u03be = 0) + \u03c3S (p2 ; \u03be = 0)\n\n(11)\n\none may obtain the form in a different covariant gauge\nthrough the operations [23, 29, 33, 34]\nZ \u221e\n\u03c2\n\u03c3V (p; \u03be) =\ndk k 2 \u03c3V (k; 0)\n\u03c0p2 0\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bb\u2212\n(12)\n\u00d7 \u2212+ ++\nln + ,\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2kp \u03bb\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n\u03c2\n1\n1\n\u03c3S (p; \u03be) =\ndk k \u03c3S (k, 0) \u2212 \u2212 + , (13)\n\u03c0p 0\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nwhere \u03bb\u00b1 = \u03c2 2 + (k \u00b1 p)2 . Focusing on the right-handsides of Eqs. (12) and (13), it will readily be apparent\nthat the limit \u03c2 \u2192 0+ (i.e., \u03be \u2192 0+ ) is well defined and\nyields \u03c3V (p, 0) and \u03c3S (p, 0). This fact establishes selfconsistency of the momentum-space integral transform.\nAs illustrated by Eq. (8), on the domain of momenta for\nwhich a perturbative calculation of the fermion propagator is accurate, which is the ultraviolet domain in QED3,\nthe passage between \u03be > 0 and \u03be < 0 is straightforward\nbecause the perturbative expansion is analytic at \u03be = 0.\nThis simplicity is also apparent in the z \u2243 0 behaviour\nof Eq. (10).\nHowever, for \u03be = \u2212|\u03be| < 0 it is less straightforward\nto obtain the dressed momentum space propagator from\nthe nonperturbative Landau gauge result. One cannot\nsimply employ Eqs. (12), (13). This is evident because\nthey are both odd under \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u03be, a property not shared\nby the perturbative expansion in Eq. (8). The breakdown\noriginates in a failure for \u03be < 0 of the conditions used in\nderiving Eqs. (12), (13). Nonetheless, an inverted procedure is available; namely, \u03c3(p; \u2212|\u03be|) are those functions\nfor which\nZ \u221e\n|\u03c2|\ndk k 2 \u03c3V (k; \u2212|\u03be|)\n\u03c3V (p; 0) =\n\u03c0p2 0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bb\u2212\n\u00d7 \u2212+ ++\n(14)\nln + ,\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2kp \u03bb\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n|\u03c2| \u221e\n1\n1\n\u03c3S (p; 0) =\ndk k \u03c3S (k, \u2212|\u03be|) \u2212 \u2212 + .(15)\n\u03c0p 0\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nIf these integral equations should prove impractical when\napplied to the solution obtained in a given truncation,\n\nthen one may return to configuration space and employ\nEq. (10). Importantly, Eq. (10) shows that the gauge dependence of the propagator is analytic at all length scales.\nHowever, in the infrared; i.e., for |z| > 1/\u03c2, a large-order\npower series in \u03be is required to accurately represent that\ngauge parameter dependence. It is on this domain, which\ncorresponds to p < \u03c2 \u2248 \u03be/25, that Eqs. (14) and (15)\nmight provide an awkward tool.\nIn closing this section we judge it important to recall that the momentum-space location of a physical\nmass pole in the fermion propagator is gauge independent. This owes to a cancellation between the gaugedependent parts of the fermion's vector and scalar selfenergies which can only occur at the pole position; see.,\ne.g., Refs. [35, 36, 37]. Conversely, the absence of a gaugeindependent mass pole is not something that the LKF\ntransformation can change [9].\nIII.\n\nCONFINEMENT AND DCSB\n\nThese phenomena were studied in Ref. [13] via two order parameters. That for DCSB was simply\n\u03c1(Nf ) =\n\nM (p = 0; Nf )\n,\nM (p = 0; Nf = 1)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the mass function is defined in Eq. (2). Naturally,\none could also use an equivalent order parameter; namely,\nthe vacuum fermion condensate:\nZ\nd3 q\nS(q) ,\n(17)\n\u2212 h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8iNf = trD\n(2\u03c0)3\nevaluated in the chiral limit, and we also consider that\nherein.\nWhile these order parameters for DCSB are familiar,\nthat for confinement might require a short explanation.\nWorking with Eq. (11), then in the absence of confinement (x = p2 )\nd2\n\u03c3V (x) > 0 , \u2200x > 0 .\ndx2\n\n(18)\n\nOn the other hand, S(p) describes a confined excitation\nif \u2203xc > 0 :\n\nd2\n\u03c3V (x)\ndx2\n\n= 0.\n\n(19)\n\nx=xc\n\nThe location of a minimum in \u03c3V\u2032 (x), xc , can therefore\nbe used to define an order parameter for deconfinement;\nviz.,4\n\u03ba(Nf ) =\n\n4\n\nxc (Nf )\n.\nxc (Nf = 1)\n\n(20)\n\nThe location of the minimum positioned farthest from x = p2 = 0\nshould be used.

(16) for \u03be = 0; i.e., Landau\ngauge, and \u03be = 1, 2 as obtained through the momentum space\nLKF transformation, Eq. (13). Plainly, the critical number of\nflavours for chiral symmetry restoration, Nfc , is independent\nof \u03be: in the model defined by Eqs. (21) and (22) we have\nNfc = \u03c0322 = 3.24 [13]. Lower panel \u2013 Vacuum fermion condensate, Eq. (17). This quantity is manifestly independent of\ngauge parameter, as explicated in [23]. (Remember, e2 = 1\nthroughout.)\n\nThese statements are associated with the realisation of\nconfinement through a violation of the axiom of reflection positivity. Any 2-point Schwinger function with an\ninflexion point at x = p2 > 0, Eq. (19), must breach\nthe axiom of reflection positivity. This entails that the\nassociated elementary excitation cannot appear in the\nHilbert space of observables. (Additional explanation can\nbe found in Sec. 2 of Ref. [3].)\nIn order to illustrate general features of QED3,\nRef. [13] employed efficacious but simple models for the\nphoton vacuum polarisation and fermion-photon vertex.\nWe follow suit, and use the so-called central Ball-Chiu\nvertex [38]\n\n\u0393\u03bc (p, q) =\n\n1\n[A(p) + A(q)] \u03b3\u03bc ;\n2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwith \u03b7 = exp(\u22122(Nf \u2212 1)/\u03c1(Nf )), and a = 0.20, b =\n0.088 and c = 7.8, which owe their nonzero values to\nDCSB and were calculated [2] for Nf = 1. (NB. For\na = 0 = b, Eq. (23) reduces to the leading order result in\na 1/Nf -expansion [15].)\nAn extensive body of research, with the estimable goal\nof determining the optimal or even true form of the\nLandau-gauge vertex; e.g., Refs. [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,\n45, 46], has produced Ans\u00e4tze more sophisticated than\nEq. (21). Studies of the polarisation are also available\n[2, 44, 46, 47]. Notwithstanding this, Eqs. (21) and (22)\nare sufficient herein.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the DCSB order parameter \u03c1(Nf ; \u03be)\nas a function of Nf in different \u03be > 0 gauges.5 It is\nevident that this order parameter is only weakly sensitive to the gauge parameter and, furthermore, that the\ncritical number of flavours for DCSB is independent of\n\u03be. In hindsight, this is obvious from Eq. (10) or (13).\nTo see this, consider the latter equation. The kernel of\nthe momentum-space LKF transformation is positive definite. Hence a nonzero \u03c3S (k) will remain nonzero after\ntransformation. On the other hand, if \u03c3S (k; \u03be = 0) vanishes at and above some value of Nf , as it does when chiral symmetry is restored, then this feature is preserved\nby the LKF transformation.\nIn Fig. 1 we also display the vacuum fermion condensate, Eq. (17). It is clearly independent of the gauge parameter, a result which is straightforward to establish\nwhen working with the LKF transformations in configuration space. However, the manner by which this invariance is expressed in momentum space is interesting.\nIt is achieved through a redistribution of support in the\nfermion mass function: as \u03be increases from zero, strength\nat low momenta is shifted to larger momenta [23].\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 2 we depict the gaugeparameter-dependence of \u03ba(Nf ) in Eq. (20). At first\nglance this figure would appear to suggest that confinement is absent in all but Landau gauge. That conclusion,\nhowever, ignores two facts. The first, remarked upon in\nthe Introduction, is that any mass-scale generated dynamically in QED3 is at least one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the natural scale, which is set by the dimensioned coupling e2 = 1; and the second, noted in\nclosing Sec. II, is that the LKF transformations cannot\ngenerate a gauge-invariant pole mass.\n\n5\n\nThe curves in Fig. 1 and the upper panel of Fig. 2 exhibit a sudden drop at Nf = 1.55. As explained in Ref. [13], this artefact\narises from the simple manner by which our model for the vacuum polarisation admits feedback from the fermion gap equation;\ni.e., through \u03b7. It has no impact on our analysis.\n\n\f5\nFor a given value of \u03be one could recover the signal of\nthe confinement mass-scale by working with a higherorder derivative of \u03c3V (p2 ): higher-order derivatives amplify infrared effects and the order needed would depend\non \u03be. Alternatively, one can switch to the confinement order parameter introduced in Ref. [48], following Ref. [49].\nThis order parameter is connected with the configuration\nspace Schwinger function\nZ\n1\nd2 x trD S(x) .\n(24)\n\u2206S (\u03c4 ) =\n4\n\n100\n10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n10-4\n1\n\n10-5\n\n0.8\n\n10-61\n\n1.5\n\n0.6\n2\n2.5\nNf\n\n0.4\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0.2\n\n\u03be\n\n40\n\n103\n\nLKFT \u03be=1\n\n102\n\nFit \u03be=1\n\n101\n\nLKFT \u03be=2\n\n0\n\nFit \u03be=2\n\n10\n\u03c3\u03bd(p,\u03be)\n\n\u03ba\n\nLKFT \u03be=3\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nFit \u03be=3\n\n10-2\n10-3\n\nIf this Schwinger function possesses a zero, then the axiom of reflection positivity is violated. The location of the\nzero can therefore be connected with an order parameter\nfor confinement: the feature is lost if the zero moves to\n\u03c4 = \u221e. One can read from Eq. (10) that the LKF transformation does not introduce or eliminate zeros in \u2206S (\u03c4 )\nbecause the LKF mass is purely real.\nIn the upper panel of Fig. 3 we plot ln |\u2206S (\u03c4 )|, which\nexhibits periodic singularities \u2200 Nf < Nfc : the singularities mark the zeros of \u2206S (\u03c4 ). It is apparent that as\nNf \u2192 Nfc the location of the first zero moves to larger\nvalues of \u03c4 . As an order parameter for confinement we\ntherefore employ [50]\n\u03bd(Nf ) :=\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10-5\n10-6\n10-12 10-10 10-8\n\n10-6\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n\n100\n\n102\n\np\n\nFIG. 2: Upper panel \u2013 Confinement order parameter, \u03ba(Nf )\nin Eq. (20), and its dependence on the gauge parameter as determined by the LKF transformation, Eq. (12). Lower panel\n\u2013 The curves show \u03c3V as a function of p, plotted for three\nnonzero values of the gauge parameter. The symbols represent a fit to these functions with the form z(\u03be)/(\u03c2(\u03be)2 + p2 ),\nwhere \u03c2(\u03be) is precisely the LKF mass defined in Eq. (10).\n\nThe lower panel of Fig. 2 helps to resolve the conundrum. Confinement is a long-range phenomenon. It is\nexpressed through \u03ba(Nf ) in the location of the minimum\nof the first derivative of \u03c3V (p2 ): if there is more than one\nminimum, that with largest magnitude is chosen. This\nminimum defines a confinement mass-scale, which by its\nnature must vanish as Nf increases. Hence, in the neighbourhood of Nfc , for arbitrarily small values of the gauge\nparameter, the confinement mass-scale is overwhelmed\nby the LKF mass, \u03c2(\u03be) in Eq. (10). Indeed, as the lower\npanel shows, the LKF mass very quickly comes to dominate completely the evolution of \u03c3V . In these observations lies explanation of the behaviour apparent in the\nupper panel of Fig. 2; namely, that with increasing \u03be the\ncurves marking the Nf -dependence of \u03ba(Nf ) depart from\nthe Landau gauge result at smaller values of Nf .\n\n1\n,\n\u03c41 (Nf )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c41 (Nf ) is the location of the first zero. This order parameter vanishes when confinement is lost. It is\nnotable that the magnitude of the curves, which is connected with \u03c1(Nf ) in Eq. (16), also diminishes rapidly\nas Nf \u2192 Nfc . This highlights the intimate connection\nbetween chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement.\nWe depict the confinement order parameter in the\nlower panel of Fig. 3. It is clear that there is a critical number of flavours, Nfc\u03bd , above which confinement is\nlost. This critical value is independent of the gauge parameter, a feature that was anticipated and explained after Eq. (24). Moreover, Nfc\u03bd = Nfc ; i.e., chiral symmetry\nrestoration and deconfinement are simultaneous in our\nillustrative model. The fundamental causal connection is\na dramatic change in the analytic properties of the propagator that accompanies the disappearance of a nonzero\nfermion scalar self-energy. As we explained above, the\nLKF transformation cannot materially affect this.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA transition between elements in the class of covariant gauges is effected by a Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin\n(LKF) transformation. The action of this transformation\non the fermion propagator in noncompact QED3 can be\nwritten in a closed form in both configuration and momentum space. Therefore it is always possible to anticipate a range of effects that the gauge transformation can\nhave on the propagator's analytic properties.

We explicated these arguments with the aid of\nsimple models for the fermion-photon vertex and photon\nvacuum polarisation. In doing so we highlighted pitfalls,\na failure of which to avoid will lead to erroneous conclusions.\n[1] M. Gopfert and G. Mack, Commun. Math. Phys. 82, 545\n(1981).\n[2] C. J. Burden, J.

In addition to other important properties, such as\nbeing a fixed point of the renormalisation group and the\ngauge in which any sensitivity to model-dependent differences between Ans\u00e4tze for the fermion-photon vertex\nare least noticeable, one can add that it is the sole covariant gauge in which the infrared behaviour of the fermion\npropagator is not modified by a non-dynamical gaugedependent exponential factor whose presence can obscure\ntruly observable features of the theory. Our model was\nhelpful in elucidating this.\nWith our Ans\u00e4tze for the fermion-photon vertex and\nphoton vacuum polarisation, QED3 exhibits chiral symmetry restoring and deconfinement transitions when the\nnumber of flavours exceeds a common critical value. We\nexpect this simultaneity to persist in QED3 proper, so\nlong as chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in the\nquenched massless theory. Our presumption is based\nupon Landau gauge Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE)\nstudies of QCD in rainbow-ladder truncation, which find\nthese transitions to be coincident at T 6= 0 [50] and\n\u03bc 6= 0 [51, 52]; and Ref. [53], which describes a model that\nexhibits a line of simultaneous transitions in the physical quadrant of the (T, \u03bc)-plane. Indeed, chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement are coincident in all\ncareful self-consistent studies of concrete models of continuum chiral-limit QCD that exhibit both phenomena.\nThis is also the case in numerical simulations of latticeregularised QCD [54].\nOur study supports a view that results derived from\nLandau gauge analyses will persist in any covariant\ngauge. Nonetheless, this does not obviate the need for\ndiscovering a quantitatively reliable Landau-gauge DSE\ntruncation [46, 55, 56].\nAcknowledgments\n\nCDR is grateful to the staff and students of the Instituto de F\u0131\u0301sica y Matem\u00e1ticas, Universidad Michoacana\nde San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo, for organising and hosting\nthe \"2nd Morelia Workshop on Nonperturbative Aspects of Field Theories,\" at which this study was completed.
