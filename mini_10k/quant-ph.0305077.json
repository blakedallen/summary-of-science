This novel family of states has been shown inherently nonclassical exhibiting new types of multimode antibunching, higher-order squeezing and violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities. Although the recognized\nkinds of nonclassical states have been numerous to date (see, e.g. [9]), it is not yet justified that all of them acquire\nactual applications. It is also not excluded that \"really needed\" states remain undiscovered or they are among the\nexisting ones with their necessary properties unnoticeable. In that sense, any further detailed study of a known state\nor introduction of a new state would be perhaps equally welcome. As for the TCS, because of their three-mode nature,\nthey would play a significant role in phenomena in which the PCS could not. For example, with the TCS one might\npredict that \"one-event\" continuous-variable local realism violating experiments could be found in a way more or\nless similar to those devised by Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger [10] or/and by Hardy [11] for observables with discrete\nspectra. However, before any expected experiment can be done, a primary question arises: how can one produce the\nTCS in practice ? This question was answered in [7] for electromagnetic fields interacting with an atom when there is\nstrong competition between trio parametric conversion and trio absorption. Here we shall concern with generation of\nTCS in the center-of-mass motion of a trapped ion. The motivation is that advanced laser-cooling techniques applied\nto single trapped ions allow to cool them down near their zero-point vibrational energy (see, e.g., Ref. [12]). In that\nquantized regime, the ion vibrational modes can be looked upon as ideal bosons which are almost uninfluenced by the\nenvironment resulting in negligible decoherences. This fact greatly favors potential implementations such as designing\nquantum logic gates in a quantum computer [13] (in particular, the controlled-NOT gate has been realized in two\n40\nCa+ ions in a Paul trap individually radiated by focused lasers [14]). Laser-driven trapped ions placed inside optical\ncavities can also entangle the cavity mode simultaneously with the internal and external degrees of freedom of the\nion [15]. Previously, the vibrational TCS in a 3D trap was shown to be generated by a scheme using eight lasers [16]\n(compare with schemes for the vibrational PCS in a 2D trap [17]). In this Letter we shall improve the scheme proposed\nin [16] by reducing the number of used lasers from eight to five. Moreover, we shall carry out detailed simulation to\nreveal that the time needed to generate the vibrational TCS can be made shorter in the improved version than in the\noriginal one [16].\nThe vibrational TCS, denoted by |\u03be, p, qi with \u03be = r exp(i\u03c6) and p, q integers, is a three-mode entangled continuous\nsuperposition of coherent states of the form\n|\u03be, p, qi =\n\nN (p, q, r) exp(3r2/3 /2)\n\u03be (p+q)/3\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ\nd\u03b8 2\u03c0 d\u03b8\u2032\n\u00d7\nexp[\u2212i(q\u03b8 + p\u03b8\u2032 )]\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1/3\n\u00d7 \u03be exp(i\u03b8)\n\u03be 1/3 exp(i\u03b8\u2032 )\n\u03be 1/3 exp[\u2212i(\u03b8 + \u03b8\u2032 )]\nx\n\n\u2217\n\ny\n\nCorresponding author.

For travelling waves gl = exp[\u2212ikl Rl ] with Rl the position operators along the laser propagation\ndirections determined by the wave vectors kl . Instead of 8 lasers as proposed in [16], here we use only 5 lasers. The\nfirst four lasers are directed as sketched in Fig. 1, each of which is detuned to the third lower sideband of the ion\nvibrational motion, i.e. \u03c9l=1,2,3,4 = \u2206 \u2212 3\u03bd. As for the fifth laser, its direction is unimportant but its frequency\nmust be in resonant with the ion transition, i.e. \u03c9l=5 = \u2206. Assuming an equal wave number for all the lasers we\nare left with a unique Lamb-Dicke parameter \u03b7 which is a measure of the ion's localization region compared with the\nlaser wavelength. If \u03bd is much larger than any other characteristic frequencies (resolved sideband limit) and \u03b7 \u226a 1\n(Lamb-Dicke limit), we have, in the interaction picture and in leading order in \u03b7, the interaction Hamiltonian of the\nform [16]\n\"\n#\n4\ni\u03b7 3 X\n\u2212i\u03c65\n\u2212i\u03c6l b3\nHint = \u2212\n\u03c3+ + H.c.\n(11)\nAl + \u03a95 e\n\u03a9l e\n6\nl=1\n\n2\n\n\fbl which are related to\nwhere the annihilation operators of the vibration quanta in the direction Rl are denoted by A\nb\nax(y,z) as\nb1 = b\nb2 = b\nA\nax + b\nay + b\naz , A\nax \u2212 b\nay + b\naz ,\n\nb3 = b\nb4 = b\nA\nax + b\nay \u2212 b\naz , A\nax \u2212 b\nay \u2212 b\naz .\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nIf we now adjust the laser intensity and phase to meet the conditions \u03a9l=1,2,3,4 = \u03a9 and \u03c6l=1,3 = \u03c6l=2,4 + \u03c0 = \u03c6, then\nthe Hamiltonian (11) simplifies to\nHint = \u03b6 (b\nax b\nay b\naz \u2212 \u03be) \u03c3+ + H.c.\n\nwith \u03b6 and \u03be determined by the system parameters in a controllable manner as\n\u03b6 = \u22126i\u03b7 3 \u03a9 exp[\u2212(i\u03c6 + \u03b7 2 /2)],\n\n\u03be=\u2212\n\ni\u03a95\nexp[i(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c65 )].\n6\u03a9\u03b7 3\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nBecause the damping of vibrational quanta is negligible, the main decay process occurs via ionic spontaneous emission\nwith rate \u03b3.

(16) has a \"dark\" steady solution \u03c1s = |gi |\u03a8i h\u03a8| hg| with |\u03a8i responsible for the steady\nstate of the ion vibration. It is easy to verify that |\u03a8i obeys the equation\nb\nax b\nay b\naz |\u03a8i = \u03be |\u03a8i .\n\n(17)\n\nPb |\u03a8i = p |\u03a8i ,\n\n(18)\n\nFurther, if the ion is initially prepared in a Fock state |\u03a80 i = |q + kix |p + kiy |kiz with k a non-negative integer,\nthen, because p and q are conserved in the problem under treatment, the state |\u03a8i satisfies also the two equations\n\nb |\u03a8i = q |\u03a8i .\nQ\n\n(19)\n\nComparing (17) - (19) with (5) - (7) yields |\u03a8i \u2261 |\u03be, p, qi which is the vibrational TCS we want to generate.\nTo follow the transient process and to assess generation time (i.e. the time needed for the system to reach the\nsteady regime) we simulate Eq. (16) by the Monte Carlo Wave-Function approach [18]. The system wave function at\ntime t is looked for in the form\nX\n\u03a6(t) =\n[Glmn (t) |gi + Elmn (t) |ei] |lix |miy |niz .\n(20)\nl,m,n\n\nFor the purpose of numerical calculation, the Fock-state basis should be confined to l, m, n \u2264 Nmax with Nmax a\ncutoff to be chosen such that its increasing does not change the result within a pre-set high enough accuracy. In\nour simulations we have found Nmax = 10 sufficient for most of the numerical calculation: just an error of less\nthan 10\u22126 arises by increasing the cutoff by one. For convenience, we use the dimensionless time \u03c4 determined by\n\u03c4 = \u03b3t. For the initial condition \u03a6(0) = |ei |q + kix |p + kiy |kiz with k = 4, the time evolution of the probability\nP (l, m, n) = |Glmn |2 + |Elmn |2 of finding the ion in a Fock state |lix |miy |niz is plotted in Fig. 2a. As is visual from\nthat figure, at the beginning P (l, m, n) oscillate but at large \u03c4 they approach |Cn (\u03be, p, q)|2 (see Eq. (4)) precisely,\nimplying generation of the vibrational TCS. The initial variation of P (l, m, n) depends on the value of k but their\nlong-time behavior is k-independent. This means that the TCS is eventually generated independently of the choice of k\nwhich is best taken as k = 0 because the state |ei |qix |piy |0iz is easiest to prepare practically. The transition towards\n\u0001\nP\nthe steady regime can be watched as well in Fig. 2b showing how the inversion h\u03c3z i = l,m,n |Elmn |2 \u2212 |Glmn |2\nevolves from 1 to \u22121. The purity of the generated state is examined by the fidelity F (\u03c4 ) = | h\u03a6(\u03c4 )| \u03be, p, qi |2 whose\n3\n\n\fchange in time is depicted in Fig. 3. Because of the truncation in the Fock basis we determine the vibrational TCS\ngeneration time \u03c4s by the constraint 1 \u2212 F (\u03c4s ) = 10\u22125 and display the \u03c4s as a function of \u03b1 = \u03b6/\u03b3 in Fig. 4a. The\ndecreasing of \u03c4s with increasing \u03b1 plays a role as will be seen.\nFinally, we discuss a possibility to make the generation time in the present improved scheme (L = 5 scheme) shorter\nthan that in the previous scheme (L = 8 scheme) [16]. Suppose we wish to produce a state |\u03be, p, qi with fixed \u03be, p and\nq. The desired values of p and q are easily to manage by preparing an initial state in the form |ei |q + nix |p + niy |niz\nwith n a non-negative integer. To tailor \u03be we use Eq. (10) of Ref. [16] and Eq. (15) of this work. The same value\nof \u03be in the L = 8 scheme can be obtained in the L = 5 scheme in either of the two following ways: (i) keeping the\nfrequency of the 5th laser in the L = 5 scheme equal to that of the 8th laser in the L = 8 scheme, but decreasing\nthe frequencies of the 1st to 4th laser in the L = 5 scheme 6 times smaller than those of the 1st to 7th laser in the\nL = 8 scheme or (ii) increasing the frequency of the 5th laser in the L = 5 scheme 6 times larger than that of the\n8th laser in the L = 8 scheme, but keeping the frequencies of the 1st to 4th laser in the L = 5 scheme equal to those\nof the 1st to 7th laser in the L = 8 scheme. In case (i) the value of \u03b6 in the L = 5 scheme (see Eq. (14) of this\nwork) remains unchanged in comparison with that in the L = 8 scheme (see the equation before Eq. (10) in Ref.\n[16]) and, hence, both schemes undergo the same dynamics. Nevertheless, if case (ii) is chosen, the value of \u03b6 in the\nL = 5 scheme becomes 6 time larger than that in the L = 8 scheme. Since \u03c4s , for the same value of \u03b3, decreases with\nincreasing \u03b6 (see Fig. 4a), a net advantage in the generation time appears in the improved scheme. Figure 4b shows\nthat advantage from an angle of the \u03be-dependence, for more clarity. A noteworthy merit of the L = 5 scheme is that,\nfor the whole range of \u03be, the desired TCS is generated in a remarkably shorter time compared with the L = 8 scheme.\nIn summary, we have improved a recently proposed scheme for generating trio coherent states in the vibrational\nmotion of an ion trapped in three dimensions. The trio coherent state generated by this scheme is stable because it\nappears in a steady regime in which the ion has fully relaxed to its ground \"dark\" state (Fig. 2b) which is identified\nby the quenched fluorescence from the ion. Besides reduction in the number of driving lasers to be used, the improved\nversion can also provide a much shorter generation time. The possibility to shorten the generation time \u03c4s relies\nupon its decrease with increasing \u03b1. In general, such a decreasing behavior does not exist for the whole range of \u03b1.\nIn fact, \u03c4s would turn out to increase with \u03b1, say, when \u03b1 is very large. For instance, in the extreme limit of \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e\n(corresponding to negligible spontaneous emission, \u03b3 \u2192 0), periodic oscillations or phenomena like collapses and\nrevivals, undamped self-pulsing or even chaos would occur. However, in problems like the one under consideration,\nwhere relaxation to a steady state within a finite time is important, \u03b3 is essential and cannot be treated as arbitrarily\nsmall and, thus, arbitrarily large values of \u03b1 are irrelevant. To specify the range of \u03b1 for which our simulations have\nbeen carried out, we use \u03b7 as a measure of smallness since \u03b7 \u226a 1 in the Lamb-Dicke limit we are working in. As\nexplained, because the ionic decay cannot be neglected, let us be interested in situations such that \u03b3 satisfies the\ncondition \u03b3/(6\u03a9) \u226b O(\u03b7 3 ). Then, from Eq. (14), we get \u03b1 = \u03b6/\u03b3 \u2243 O(6\u03a9\u03b7 3 /\u03b3) which is much less than unity. For\nsmaller values of \u03b3 (i.e. larger \u03b1), as mentioned above, abundant dynamics associated with other different timescales\nwill take place which should be dealt with separately (e.g., by means of multiple-timescale analyses).\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank the KIAS Quantum Information Group for useful discussions.
