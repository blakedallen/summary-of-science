It is wellknown that Kaluza-Klein theory 1), 2) created interest in\ninvestigations in spacetime which has more than four dimensions. Superstring theories (e.g. Ref. 3) ) are at the moment the most promising candidates for a unified\ndescription of the basic physical interactions. There are five anomaly-free, perturbative superstring theories. The critical dimensions of spacetime are ten for these\ntheories. There is now evidence that the five superstring theories are related by\nduality symmetries. Furthermore, they are related to N = 1, D = 11 supergravity\ntheory. It is conjectured that these theories are the limits of one theory, M-theory,\nin which spacetime has eleven dimensions.\nSince spacetime has four large dimensions and some additional number of small\nand highly curved spatial dimensions, we can see only the four large dimensions.\nHow does compactification of internal space take place? The first answer is through\nmultidimensional cosmology. In general relativity, the geometry of spacetime is dynamical. The three-dimensional space we observe was once as small as the internal\nspace, and expanded during evolution of the universe, while internal space contracted\nor has remained small during evolution of the universe. Therefore, internal space\nis microscopic and is not observable. This explanation is called dynamical compactification. The second explanation involves by spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\u2217)\n\u2217\u2217)\n\nE-mail: ochiai@utap.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nE-mail: sato@utap.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\ntypeset using P T P TEX.sty <ver.0.8>\n\n\f2\n\nH. Ochiai and K. Sato\n\nThough spacetime would have SO(D\u22121,1) for D > 4, after symmetry breaking only\nSO(3,1) is visible, and internal space is static and at the Planck scale. This explanation is called spontaneous compactification. Lately, another possible mechanism\nof compactication by branes in string theory has been discussed. 4), 5) It is possible\nthat the Standard Model gauge fields exist on branes rather than in the bulk of\nspacetime. If this is the case, the situation in which gravity exists in the bulk of\nthe 10-dimensional spacetime, while the Standard Model particles exist on a 3-brane\nis possible. It remains unknown which mechanism of compactification explains our\nuniverse. In this paper we consider dynamical compactification only in the view of\nmultidimensional cosmology.\nThe simplest multidimensional cosmological model that is useful for understanding compactification is the type of extended Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe.\nThe pioneering work for this model was done by Chodos and Detweiler. 6) They found\nthat the 5-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations possess the Kasner solution, which\ndescribes a universe in which the internal space shrinks, while the external space expands. Freund investigated the model in the case of D = 11 supergravity. 7) Various\nmultidimensional models were investigated, and the manner in which the existence\nof internal space might impact cosmological issues such as entropy production and\ninflation (e.g. Refs. 8), 9), 10) ) was discussed.\nOn the other hand, the creation of the universe is a problem of great interest.\nIn the standard big-bang cosmology, the universe appeared from an initial singularity. When the density is greater than the Planck density, classical general relativity\nbreaks down and quantum gravitational effects are large. Based on quantum gravitational theory, the scenario of quantum creation of the universe was suggested.\nVilenkin asserted that the inflationary universe appears through quantum tunneling\nfrom nothing. 11) Later Hartle and Hawking suggested the scenario of the creation\nof the universe through a different method. 12) That method is called the HartleHawking no-boundary proposal. According to this proposal the universe in the\nquantum era is Euclidean manifold without \"boundary\", and through analytic continuation to the Lorentzian manifold, the classical universe is created. The condition\nof analytic continuation gives the initial condition of the universe. Recently, a prebig-bang scenario has been suggested. 13) This scenario is based on string theory and\nhas attractive features. However, it has a graceful exit problem. In this paper we\nconsider quantum cosmology from the viewpoint of Hartle and Hawking.\nThe concept of quantum creation is extended to the multidimensional universe\nwith consistency. Hu and Wu 14), 15) discussed the vacuum model in which the spacetime metric has the form R \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 S n in the framework of the Hartle-Hawking\nno-boundary proposal, where R is the time, S 3 is the external space, and S n is\nthe internal space. They showed that the universe most probably evolves with an\nexponentially expanding external space and a static internal space. This solution\nimplies that we observe 4-dimensional spacetime because internal spaces are compact and static at Planckian scales. More complicated multidimensional quantum\ncosmological models have been investigated (e.g. Refs. 16), 17), 18), 19), 20), 25) ).\nModels based on unified theories, such as supergravity theories, which are the\nlow energy limits of superstring theories, would be more realistic than the simplest\n\n\f3\n\nA Multidimensional Cosmological Model\n\nvacuum model. 16), 18), 20) However, it is thought that the essence of the creation of\nthe universe may be included in the vacuum model, and it is useful for investigating\nmore realistic models. Detailed analysis of the vacuum model is, therefore, important. Hu and Wu discussed only the instanton that nucleates the most probable\nuniverse, but the instanton solutions are unstable with respect to perturbations, and\nthe Euclidean classical solutions near the instanton have effects on the wave function\nof the universe. Therefore we analyse instantons in more detail, and also investigate\ndynamical properties of the Euclidean Einstein equations of this model by numerical\ncalculations. As shown in \u00a73, the dynamical properties of the system is of interest,\nand it is found that the system has a \"quasi-attractor\".\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72, we introduce the multidimensional\ncosmological model with cosmological constant (\u039b) but without matter fields. In \u00a73,\nwe give the constraints on the signatures of the spatial curvature and the cosmological constant and analyze the Euclidean classical solutions. In \u00a74, we investigate\ncontinuation from the Euclidean classical solutions to Lorentzian solutions, and discuss the scenario quantum creation of the universe. The last section is devoted to\nconclusions and remarks.\n\u00a72.\n\nThe model\n\nWe consider a D(= 1 + m + n)-dimensional vacuum universe with a cosmological\nconstant (\u039b) but without matter fields.

Since the\nfactor exp(\u2212Bk ) dominates wave function behavior, we analyse the classical solutions\nof the Euclidean Einstein equations.\nThe Euclidean Einstein equations are given by\na\u2032\u2032\nb\u2032\u2032\n+ n + \u03b1 = 0,\na\nb\n!2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\na\nab\n(m \u2212 1)km\na\n+n\n+ (m \u2212 1)\n\u2212\n+ \u03b1 = 0,\na\na\nab\na2\nm\n\nb\u2032\u2032\nb\u2032\n+ (n \u2212 1)\nb\nb\n\n!2\n\n+m\n\na\u2032 b\u2032 (n \u2212 1)kn\n\u2212\n+ \u03b1 = 0,\nab\nb2\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nwhere primes denote derivatives with respect to the imaginary time \u03c4 . The Hamiltonian constraint in the Euclidean version is described as\na\u2032\nm(m \u2212 1)\na\n\n!2\n\nb\u2032\na\u2032 b\u2032\n+ 2mn\n+ n(n \u2212 1)\nab\nb\n\n!2\n\n\u2212 V = 0.\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe assume that a= 0 and/or b = 0 at \u03c4 = 0. The Hartle-Hawking no-boundary\nproposal gives the boundary condition for the Euclidean Einstein equations. According to this proposal, the Euclidean solutions must be analytic. At \u03c4 = 0, therefore,\na and b can be expanded in Taylor series. This determines the boundary conditions\nof the Euclidean solutions. In addition, the external space of the present universe is\nmacroscopic and the scale factor of the internal space is related to the gauge coupling\nconstant. Therefore we do not consider trivial solutions, a(\u03c4 ) = 0 and/or b(\u03c4 ) = 0\nfor any \u03c4 . These constraints lead to the following boundary conditions:\n(a) Boundary Condition 1(BC1)\nkm = 1,\na(0) = 0, a\u2032 (0) = 1,\nb(0) = b0 , b\u2032 (0) = 0.\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n\n(b) Boundary Condition 2(BC2)\nkn = 1,\na(0) = a0 , a\u2032 (0) = 0,\nb(0) = 0, b\u2032 (0) = 1.\n\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n(3.11)\n\nThe boundary condition BC2 is the symmetric version of the boundary condition BC1. These boundary conditions imply that either internal space or external\nspace has positive curvature (km = 1 or kn = 1). We can solve the Euclidean Einstein equations numerically under these boundary conditions. Below, the families of\nEuclidean solutions parameterized by b0 and a0 are calculated.\n\n\f6\n\nH. Ochiai and K. Sato\n\nWe assume that the Euclidean solutions are connected to classical Lorentzian\nsolutions at a finite \u03c4 , where a\u2032 = b\u2032 = 0. Due to the Hamiltonian constraint (2.13),\nthe value of the potential at the connection surface must be\nV =\n\nm(m \u2212 1)km n(n \u2212 1)kn\n+\n\u2212 2\u039b = 0.\na2\nb2\n\n(3.12)\n\nNow we discuss the constraints on the signature of the spatial curvatures and the\ncosmological constant. First, it is easily shown that either internal space or external\nspace must have positive curvature (km = 1 or kn = 1) from the boundary conditions\nBC1 and BC2. Second, the condition that the connection surface V = 0 exists gives\nconstraints on the signatures of km , kn and \u039b. For example, when each signature of\nkm and kn is the same, and \u039b = 0, the potential V (a, b) cannot be zero anywhere.\nThe combinations of signatures of km , kn and \u039b for which the surface V = 0 exists,\nare shown in Table I.\nTable I. The signatures of km , kn and \u039b under the condition that the surface V = 0 exists.\n(m \u2212 1)km\n(n \u2212 1)kn\n\u039b=0\n\u039b>0\n\u039b<0\n\n+\n+\nno\nyes\nno\n\n+\n0\nno\nyes\nno\n\n+\n\u2212\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n0\n+\nno\nyes\nno\n\n0\n0\nyes\nno\nno\n\n0\n\u2212\nno\nno\nyes\n\n\u2212\n+\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\u2212\n0\nno\nno\nyes\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nno\nno\nyes\n\nEven if these conditions are satisfied, however, the Euclidean solutions cannot\nbe necessarily connected to Lorentzian solutions, since in some classes of solutions, a\nand b increase monotonically and have no velocity-zero points, i. e. points for which\n\u0227 = \u1e03 = 0. We calculated Euclidean solutions numerically, changing the initial values,\nand investigated whether these Euclidean solutions can be connected to Lorentzian\nsolutions or not. Except for the case in which (m\u22121)km > 0, (n\u22121)kn > 0 and \u039b > 0,\nthe scale factors a and b vary monotonically, and the condition a\u2032 = b\u2032 = 0 cannot\nbe satisfied at any \u03c4 . Then, we found that Euclidean solutions can be connected to\nthe Lorentzian region only for the case in which (m \u2212 1)km > 0, (n \u2212 1)kn > 0 and\n\u039b > 0. After all, only the case in which km = kn = 1 and \u039b > 0 is possible in our\nmodel. This implies that the internal space cannot be 1-dimensional, because the\ncurvature term of the Einstein equations is zero for 1-dimensional space. Therefore\nthe dimensions of space m and n must be greater than 2.\nWe now discuss the Euclidean solutions in the case that km = kn = 1 and \u039b > 0\nin detail.

Second, if b0 (or a0 ) is\nless than a critical value bcr (or acr ) but greater than bA (or aA ), the trajectories\ngo around the point (aA , bA ) and flow to (a, b) \u2192 (0, \u221e) (or (\u221e,0)). When b0 (or\na0 ) is just equal to bA (or aA ), b (or a) is constant (the solution (1) (or (3))) and\nthe trajectory is a straight line. Third, if b0 (or a0 ) is lower than bA (or aA ), the\ntrajectories go around the point (aA , bA ) and flow to (a, b) \u2192 (\u221e, 0) (or (0,\u221e)).\nNote that the critical values bcr and acr depend only on the dimension of the\nspacetime D as described by (3.20). We call the point (aA , bA ), around which the\ntrajectories circulate, the \"quasi-attractor.\" The \"quasi-attractor\" plays a role in\ngathering the trajectories of the classical Euclidean solutions to the instanton solutions (Eqs. (3.9)-(3.14)), and approximately connecting to the Lorentzian solutions.\nIn the next section we discuss the properties of the Lorentzian solutions.\n\u00a74.\n\nLorentzian solutions\n\nIn this section we investigate the Lorentzian solutions that are continued from\nthe Euclidean solutions we have presented in the preceding section in the case that\nthe curvatures of both external and internal spaces are positive and \u039b > 0. The\nEuclidean manifold is connected to the Lorentzian manifold, where the velocities of\nthe scale factors are vanishing, and it can be shown that at the connection surface,\nthe value of the potential V must be vanishing.\nThere are three following exact solutions which are analytically continued from\ninstantons:\n(1)\n\na=\n\ns\n\nm(m + n \u2212 1)\ncosh\n2\u039b\n\ns\n\n(n \u2212 1)(n + m \u2212 1)\nb=\n2\u039b\n\n#1/2\n\na=\n\ns\n\n(m + n)(m \u2212 1)\ncosh\n2\u039b\n\ns\n\nb=\n\ns\n\n(m + n)(n \u2212 1)\ncosh\n2\u039b\n\n\"\n\n!\n\n2\u039b\nt ,\nm(m + n \u2212 1)\n\n(4.1)\n\n.\n\n(4.2)\n\n(2)\n\ns\n\n!\n\n2\u039b\nt ,\n(m + n)(m + n \u2212 1)\n!\n\n2\u039b\nt .\n(m + n)(m + n \u2212 1)\n\n(4.3)\n(4.4)\n\n\f10\n\nH.

(3.9) \u223c(3.14)), and approximately connecting to Lorentzian solutions. Strictly\nspeaking, the Euclidean solutions near these instanton solutions cannot analytically\ncontinue to Lorentzian solutions. Since these nearby solutions exists very densely,\ntheir effects are necessary for estimating the wave function of the universe. Therefore we make detailed analysis of these solutions. The Lorentzian solutions under the\ninitial conditions that the velocities of the scale factors on the connection surface\nV (a, b) = 0 are zero are approximately continued from these solutions. Thus we\ncalculate the Lorentzian solutions continued approximately from these solutions. In\nFig. 4 the Lorentzian solutions in the a-b plane are shown. The solutions between\nthe solutions (1) and (3) show that both external and internal spaces expand monotonically. On the other hand, the outer solutions of the exact solution (3) show that\ninternal space expands and external space contracts. The outer solutions of the exact\nsolution (1), which are nothing but the symmetric version of the former solutions,\nshow that external space expands and the internal space contracts (Fig. 5). The\nlast solutions imply that external space of the observed universe is macroscopic and\ninternal space of the observed universe is microscopic.\n\u00a75.\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the quantum creation of a multidimensional\nuniverse with a cosmological constant but without matter fields in the framework\nof the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. The most interesting result is that\nthere are \"quasi-attractor,\" i.e., most trajectories of the classical solutions of the\nEuclidean Einstein equation go around on the a-b plane, independently of the initial\nvalues, provided that the initial values of the scale factors are smaller than a critical\nvalue in the case that the curvatures of both the external and internal spaces are\npositive and \u039b > 0. This characteristic behavior of the evolution of the scale factors\nin Euclidean time is essentially independent of the numbers of external and internal\nspaces dimensions, provided that m, n \u2265 2.\nSince the trajectories approach the quasi-attractor at the first step, it plays a role\nin gathering the paths of the classical Euclidean solutions to the instantons ((3.9)\n\u223c(3.14)) independently of the initial values. Then, it is very natural to assume that\nthe wave function has a hump near this quasi-attractor point. There Lorentzian\nsolutions which start from the points on the continuation surface near the quasiattractor give a dominant contribution to the wave function in the Lorentzian region.\nAs the example is in Fig. 5 shown, there are solutions for which we can interpret\n\n\f11\n\nA Multidimensional Cosmological Model\n9\n\n(2)\n\n8\n\n(1)\n\n7\n\n(3)\n\n6\n\n5\n\nb\n\nV=0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\na\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFig. 4.

The Wheeler-De Witt equations of the multi-dimensional\nvacuum universe have been analysed by Chmielowski, 23) but only for models with\nzero cosmological constant. According to his result, if neither of the subspaces has\nnegative curvature, then there exists no Lorentzian solution. Obviously, interesting\ncases are those of the positive cosmological constant, as we have discussed in the\n\n\f12\n\nH. Ochiai and K. Sato\n\npresent paper. Analysis of the Wheeler-De Witt equations in this model is under\nprogress.\nIn order to make more realistic models, we must consider more complicated\nmodels on the basis of fundamental theories. As shown in Fig. 5, the solutions\nwhich show that the external space expands and the internal spaces collapses in finite time are adequate models for our universe, provided that the collapse of inner\nspace is halted. Furthermore, because the volume of the internal space is related\nto the constants of nature, the present internal space must be stable at the order\nof the Planck scale. Fortunately, it is considered that the collapse of the internal\nspace is halted by the pressure of the gauge fields or by a quantum effects, and the\ninternal space is stabilized. It was shown that in D = 6, N = 2 supergravity theories, the solution of (the 4-dimensional Friedmann universe)\u00d7 (a constant S 2 ) is the\nattractor; i.e., all cosmological solutions starting from arbitrary initial conditions approach to the above spacetime asymptotically. 24) Moreover, stable compactification\nof the extra dimensions by quantum effects was studied. The quantum corrections\nto the effective potential are attributed to the Casimir effects in many works (e.g.\nRefs. 26), 25) and references therein). In Ezawa et al, 27) the quantum effects of higher\ncurvature gravity theories are investigated. From these investigations, if is known\nthat an effective potential of the model obtained under dimensional reduction to a\n4-dimensional effective theory has minima at the Planck scale for the scale factors\nof internal spaces. Therefore the internal spaces can be stable.\nOur work is simply based on canonical quantum gravity in general relativity.\nIt is, however, thought that general relativity is a low-energy limit of the ultimate\nunified theory. Although the Einstein equation would be necessarily modified at\nhigh energy, it must include essential points of the ultimate theory. It is natural\nto conjecture that the ultimate theory may include the present simple model as an\napproximate description. It seems that analysis of the simple model given in the\npresent paper may be useful for further investigations of the basis of fundamental\ntheories such as superstring theories and supergravity theories.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are very grateful to Dr. Takeshi Chiba and Dr. Keita Ikumi for useful\ndiscussions.
