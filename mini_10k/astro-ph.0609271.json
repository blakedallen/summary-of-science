In\nrecent years there has been debate over paradoxical features of the model, and the physical interpretation of\nits dynamics. Attention has been drawn in particular\nto superluminal recession velocities (Davis & Lineweaver\n2001; Davis, Lineweaver, & Webb 2001; Chodorowski 2006;\nSitnikov 2006) and to the motion of test particles in expanding space (Davis, Lineweaver, & Webb 2001; Whiting 2004;\nGr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y 2006; Peacock 2006). It is to the second of\nthese issues that we turn our attention.\nThe motion of test particles in the FLRW model is\na fascinating illustration of the interaction between physical concepts and quantitative theories. One of the defining\ncharacteristics of physics is the mathematical precision of\nits predictions. Yet there is more to applying physical laws\nthan simply solving equations. In order to make physical\nlaws more transparent and accessible, we use physical concepts that develop an intuition or a mental picture of the\nscenario. A successful physical concept allows us to shortcut the mathematics, qualitatively understanding a scenario\nwithout having to solve the equations. As an example, consider the north pole of a bar magnet approaching a loop\nof wire. Looking from behind the magnet, we know that\nan anti-clockwise current will be set up in the wire, but\nwe need not come to this conclusion by solving Maxwell's\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: luke, mfrancis, jbjames, gfl@physics.usyd.edu.au\n\nequations-Lenz's law will give us the answer without the\nmathematics.\nAttached to the equations of the FLRW model is the\nphysical concept that \"space is expanding\". Galaxies, we are\ntaught, are receding not because they are moving through\nspace but because space itself is being stretched between us\nand the galaxy. On the face of it, this concept gives us a good\nintuitive understanding of many cosmological phenomena-\nit helps us understand why the velocity-distance law is linear\nand why light is redshifted as it moves through the universe. However, it has been attacked recently, most notably\nby Whiting (2004) and Peacock (2006), as being inadequate\nin describing local dynamics. Whilst Peacock (2006) will allow a global form of the expanding space concept-the total\nvolume of a closed universe increases with time-he contends\nthat:\nthere is no local effect on particle dynamics from the global\nexpansion of the universe . . . 'Expanding space' is in general a\ndangerously flawed way of thinking about an expanding universe.\n\nPrevious attempts at resolving this debate have suffered from a number of shortcomings. The most common\nis the overwhelming desire to approximate General Relativity (GR) by something else-Newtonian gravity, Special Relativity (SR) or a weak field limit of GR. This is\nprobably wrong and certainly unnecessary-why approximate when you can use the exact geodesic equations? Another problem is the small range of cosmological models\nconsidered-Gr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y (2006), for example, do a marvellous job of solving the geodesic equations and then apply the solution to just two models, both of which are\n\n\f2\n\nBarnes, Francis, James and Lewis\n\nobservationally disfavoured. There is also a dangerous reliance on numerical calculations to determine asymptotic\n(t \u2192 \u221e) behaviour. Whiting (2004) makes this point about\nDavis, Lineweaver, & Webb (2001), but doesn't say why analytic solutions to a Newtonian approximation are better\nthan numerical solutions of the exact GR equations.\nIn this paper we address these problems by treating\nthe asymptotic behaviour of the full GR equations analytically, for general (up to non-oscillating, bounded equations\nof state) cosmological models. Section 2 will give the full\nequations of motion for particles in the FLRW model. In\nSection 3 we will analyse test particle motion and correct\nsome errors made in previous work. In Section 4 we consider\nthe asymptotic behaviour of particles in the universe, and\nin particular the notion of joining the Hubble flow. Finally,\nin Section 5 we briefly outline the relevance of our results\nfor expanding space. Our aim is not to be the final word\nin this debate but instead to clarify the relevant features of\nRobertson-Walker spacetime.\n\n2\n\nTHE COSMOLOGICAL GR EQUATIONS OF\nMOTION\n\nWe begin by giving the equations for the FLRW model. The\nRobertson-Walker (RW) metric, which tells us how to measure distance and time in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, has the line element:\n\u0001\u0001\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 R2 (t) d\u03c72 + Sk2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n(1)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (hereafter c = 1, unless\nreintroduced for clarity) and Sk (\u03c7) = sin \u03c7, \u03c7, sinh \u03c7 for\nk = +1, 0, \u22121, where k is the curvature constant for closed,\nflat and open space respectively. The RW metric relates the\nspacetime interval ds to the cosmic time t and the spherical comoving coordinates (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6). More will be said about\nthese coordinates later. The scale factor R(t) is the key prediction of any cosmological model, encapsulating the beginning, evolution and fate of the universe. We can also define\nthe Hubble parameter H, which measures the rate of expansion of the universe:\n1 dR\nH\u2261\n(2)\nR dt\nIn the curved, expanding spacetime of the RW metric,\nwe must be very careful when defining distance measures\n(see Linder (1997) for details and Hogg (1999) for a summary). Throughout this paper, we will use proper distance\nrp , which is defined as being the radial (d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0) spacetime interval (ds) along a hypersurface of constant cosmic\ntime (dt = 0)1 . The RW metric then gives the proper distance between the origin (\u03c7 = 0) and \u03c7 at time t to be:\n1\n\nA thought experiment for measuring proper distance is as follows: we imagine being at one end of a giant ruler, pointed at a\ndistant object. A volunteer is sent along the ruler to read off the\ndistance to the object. Since the universe is expanding, the volunteer will need to carry a clock that displays cosmic time, and\nnote down the time when the measurement was made. When light\nrays have carried the volunteer's result back to us, we will know\nthe proper distance to the object at the time the measurement\nwas made. Samuel (2005) criticises proper distance as \"violating\nthe principle that instantaneous non-local measurements cannot\n\nrp (t) = R(t)\u03c7(t)\n\n(3)\n\nThe field equations of GR allow us to find R(t) given the\nenergy content of the universe. The result is the Friedmann\nequations, which, following Hobson, Efstathiou, & Lasenby\n(2005), equation 15.13, we will write as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22123(1+wi )\nX\nR\n\u03a9i,0\nH 2 = H02\n(4)\nR0\ni\nThe other two Friedmann equations can be found in\nHobson, Efstathiou, & Lasenby (2005), but will not be\nneeded here. A subscript zero always refers to a quantity\nevaluated at the present epoch. The sum is over the energy components of the universe (labelled i), each with\ncorresponding equation of state wi = pi /\u03c1i , where p is\nthe pressure and \u03c1 is the energy density. Equation (4) assumes that the energy components do not interact and that\neach wi is a constant2 , as it is for most familiar forms\nof energy-matter (wm = 0), radiation (wr = 1/3), vacuum energy (w\u039b = \u22121). The sum includes\n\"curvature enP\nergy\" (\u03a9k,0 = \u2212k/(R0 H0 )2 = 1 \u2212 i6=k \u03a9i,0 ) which has\nwk = \u22121/3. This can be thought of as convenient shorthand.\nA particular solution to the Friedmann equations which will\nprove useful in Section 4.2 is the case of a universe with a\nsingle component w > \u22121:\nR(t) = R0\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nt0\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n3(1+w)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere t0 is the age of the\nFor w = \u22121, we have the\n\u0011\n\u0010 universe.\n0\n,\nwhere\nt0 is the e-folding time\nsolution R(t) = R0 exp t\u2212t\nt0\nfor the expansion. We will not consider phantom energy with\nw < \u22121 (see Caldwell, Kamionkowski, & Weinberg 2003,\nand references therein for details).\nThe trajectory of a particle in the universe is computed\nby solving the geodesic equations of GR, given by:\nc\nb\nd2 xa\na dx dx\n+\n\u0393\n=0\nbc\nd\u03bb2\nd\u03bb d\u03bb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bb is an affine parameter, the indices a, b, c run from 0\nto 3 and (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (t, \u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6). The Christoffel symbol\n\u0393abc is given by:\n\u0393abc =\n\n1 ad\ng (\u2202b gcd + \u2202c gbd \u2212 \u2202d gbc )\n2\n\n(7)\n\nFor the RW metric, we have\ngab = diag(1, \u2212R2 , \u2212R2 Sk2 (\u03c7), \u2212R2 Sk2 (\u03c7) sin2 \u03b8)\n\n(8)\n\nbe made\". This amounts to criticising a spacelike interval for being a spacelike interval. In any GR metric, length or distance is\ndefined as the spacetime interval along a surface of constant time,\nand as such can never be known instantaneously. This does not\nmean, however, that proper distance is unphysical. It only means\nthat it must be reconstructed at a later time from the information\nin light signals.\n2 Evolving equations of state and interacting components will\nonly be considered with regards to their asymptotic behaviour-\ncf. footnote 5; see Barnes et al.

We will only consider\ntimelike geodesics.\nEquations (9a)-(9d) allow a trivial solution, i.e. \u03c7, \u03b8,\n\u03c6 = constant for all time. Thus, there exists a family of\nfree-falling particles that maintain their position in comoving coordinates-in fact, this is what we mean by comoving\ncoordinates. This family of particles defines the Hubble flow.\nFor motion in one dimension, we can choose our\ncoordinates to make make the motion purely radial.\nGr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y (2006) study this case and derive the following useful equations:\n2\n\n4 \u22121/2\n\n\u03c7\u0307 =(R + CR )\nZ\ndt\n\u221a\n\u03c7 =\u03c70 \u00b1\nR 1 + CR2\nwhere\nC=\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 2\n\u03c7\u030720 R04\nR0\n\n(11)\n\nis strictly positive. Note that these are equations for \u03c7 as a\nfunction of t not \u03bb.\n\n3\n\nMOTION OF TEST PARTICLES\n\nFollowing previous work on this topic, we set up the initial\nconditions of our test particle as follows. We place ourselves\nat the origin (\u03c7 = 0) and the test particle at \u03c70 . We consider the particle to initially have constant proper distance\n\u1e59p (t0 ) = 0 i.e.\n(R(t)\u03c7)\ndt\n\nt=t0\n\n=0\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u1e58(t0 )\u03c70 + R(t0 )\u03c7\u0307(t0 ) = 0\n\n(12)\n\nThe reason for this particular initial condition is quite\nsimple. A popular way of visualising expanding space is\na balloon or a large rubber sheet. Imagine yourself and a\nfriend at rest on a large rubber sheet. We cannot directly\nobserve spacetime, so we will do this thought experiment in\nthe dark3 . Suppose you both observe a glowing ball moving\naway from you. \"The rubber sheet is being stretched,\" you\nsay. \"No it's not,\" replies your friend, \"the sheet is still and\nthe ball is rolling away.\" Together, you come up with an\n3\n\ningenious way of finding out who is right. You take another\nglowing ball, and drop it onto the sheet a certain distance\naway. If the sheet is expanding, then we expect it to carry\nthe ball away; if the sheet is still then the recession of the\nfirst ball was due to a kinematical initial condition. Once\nthis is removed, so is the recession.\nThe cosmological expansion is a bit more complicated,\nas we have expansion that changes with time due to the self\ngravitation of the energy contents of the universe. We will\ntherefore need to consider a range of cosmological models.\nFor reasons that will become clear in the next section, we will\nconsider models given by Equation (5). We will allow \u03c7 to\nbe negative when a particle passes through the origin, rather\nthan have to worry about a change in angular coordinates.\nWe have chosen t0 = 1 and R0 = 1 for each model. We\nstarted each particle off at comoving coordinate \u03c70 = 1/3,\nwhich ensures that C > 0. Physically, this ensures that we\ndo not place the particle beyond the Hubble sphere, which\nwould require a velocity relative to the local Hubble flow\n(peculiar velocity) greater than the speed of light4 .\nThe results of solving the geodesic equations are shown\nin Figure 1. The dotted line in the centre panels shows the\nmotion of the particle as calculated by a Newtonian analysis\n(see Whiting (2004) and Peacock (2006)). The equation of\nmotion is:\nrpNewton = 2R0 \u03c70\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n\nWe will not speculate on how you two came to be standing on\na rubber sheet in the dark.\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nt0\n\n\u00131/3\n\n\u2212 R0 \u03c70\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nt0\n\n\u00132/3\n\n(13)\n\nThe Newtonian result is surprisingly accurate, remaining\nclose to the GR solution even up to 100 times the age of the\nuniverse. It is seen to diverge from the exact solution eventually, though, and thus remains only a useful approximation\nfor small times. This divergence becomes more apparent as\nwe increase \u03c70 , i.e. as we approach the Hubble sphere. If\nwe consider the w = 0, Einstein de-Sitter universe and set\n\u03c70 = 1, then the solutions diverge much more quickly. Figure 2 reproduces Figure 1 of Whiting (2004), overlaying the\nrelativistic solution. It is easy to see that whilst the qualitative behaviour is similar, the Newtonian solution is quantitatively different.\nReturning to Figure 1, a few points are noteworthy. The\nbottom, leftmost panel (w = \u22122/3) shows the particle trajectory moving away from the origin and very quickly becoming indistinguishable from the nearby Hubble flow. The\nother panels do not show the same behaviour, but instead\nthe particle moves toward the origin and away on the opposite side of the sky. Moreover, they don't seem to be attaching themselves to any particular particle in the Hubble flow.\nBut, as noted in the introduction, it is dangerous to try to\ndetermine asymptotic behaviour from numerical plots. We\nmust do it analytically.\n\n4\n\nGr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y (2006), equation (22) gives this condition incorrectly. The correct formula, which follows directly from their\nequation (21), is \u03c70 < 3(1 + w)/2. They then claim to start at\nparticle off at \u03c70 = 1 in a Milne (w = \u22121/3) universe, which\ncontradicts the previous condition on \u03c70 . Therefore, their Figure\n1b) appears to plot a null geodesic.\n\n\f4\n\nBarnes, Francis, James and Lewis\nw = \u22122/3\n\nComoving Coordinate \u03c7\n\n0.4\n\n50\n\nw = \u22121/3\n100\n0\n0.35\n\n50\n\nw=0\n100\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n50\n\nw = 1/3\n100\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n50\n\nw = 2/3\n100\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u22120.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\n0.15\n0.2\n0.1\n\u22120.2\n0.15\n\np\n\nProper Distance r\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.3\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.05\n\n\u22120.05\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22120.8\n\n1200\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22126\n\u22124\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22121.2\n\n\u22127\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n\u22121.4\n100\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n\u22125\n\ntime t\nFigure 1.

Davis, Lineweaver, & Webb (2001)\nand Gr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y (2006) claim that they will asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow, whilst Whiting (2004) states\nthat \"it cannot be asserted that . . . free particles [are] swept\ninto the Hubble flow, even asymptotically.\" This is an important issue because it is often claimed that the expansion\nof space will dampen out all motion through space, so that a\nparticle initially removed from the Hubble flow will asymptotically rejoin it.\n\nOn closer inspection, this disagreement stems from different definitions of what it means to \"asymptotically rejoin\nthe Hubble flow.\" In this section we will propose a number\nof precise definitions of this phrase, and then see which ones\nare equivalent and which ones hold in an eternally expanding\nbut otherwise arbitrary universe. We will not consider universes in which the current expansion becomes a contraction\nat some point in the future. This would be an unnecessary\nand distracting complication when considering the expansion of space. We do not claim that this list is exhaustive.\n\n4.1\n\nSeven Definitions\n\nDefinition 1 (\u03c7\u0307 \u2192 0): A particle with coordinate\ntrajectory \u03c7(t) asymptotically rejoins the Hubble flow if\n\u03c7\u0307(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nThe particle is deemed to asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow if its velocity through coordinate space approaches\nthe velocity through coordinate space of the Hubble flow,\nnamely zero.\n\nDefinition 2 (\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u221e ): A particle with coordinate\ntrajectory \u03c7(t) asymptotically rejoins the Hubble flow if\n\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, where \u03c7\u221e is a constant that depends\non the cosmology and initial conditions.\nThe Hubble flow is defined by having constant coordinates.\nThus, we consider a particle to approach the Hubble flow if\nits radial coordinate approaches a constant. The asymptotic\nvalue of the radial coordinate (\u03c7\u221e ) can be thought of as the\n\"rightful place\" of the particle in the Hubble flow.\n\n\f5\n\nJoining the Hubble Flow\n\nrequire that the proper distance between the test particle\nand the reference particle approach zero. In other words,\nthe test particle sees its rightful place in the Hubble flow\nget closer (in terms of proper distance) asymptotically. Note\nthat if we had chosen instead to require that R(t)\u03c7(t) \u2192\nR(t)\u03c7\u221e then this definition would have been equivalent to\nDefinition 2 by Equation (15).\n\n2\n1.5\nProper Distance\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nDefinition 6 (zobs \u2192 zcosm ): A particle with observed\nredshift zobs (tr ) at time of reception tr asymptotically\nrejoins the Hubble flow if zobs (tr ) \u2192 zcosm as tr \u2192 \u221e,\nwhere te is the time of emission of a photon that reaches\nthe observer at tr .\n\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\u22122\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nTime\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 2. A reproduction of Figure 1 in Whiting (2004), plotting\nproper distance against time for a test particle released from \u03c70 =\n1 in an Einstein de-Sitter universe (i.e. flat, matter only). The dotdashed line is the Newtonian solution, whilst the solid line is the\nrelativistic solution. The dashed lines represent particles in the\nHubble flow. The discrepancy between the solutions is obvious.\n\nDefinition 3 (vpec \u2192 0): A particle with coordinate\ntrajectory \u03c7(t) asymptotically rejoins the Hubble flow if\nvpec (t) \u2261 R(t)\u03c7\u0307(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nWe can divide the proper velocity (\u1e59p ) of a test particle into\na recession component and a peculiar component as follows:\n\u1e59p = \u1e58(t)\u03c7(t) + R(t)\u03c7\u0307(t) = vrec (t) + vpec (t)\n\n(14)\n\nIf we move our coordinate origin so that \u03c7(t) = 0 at time\nt, then we see that the proper velocity of the test particle\nis solely its peculiar velocity. Thus peculiar velocity is simply proper velocity relative to the local Hubble flow. The\nrequirement that vpec (t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e is equivalent to the\nvelocity relative to the local Hubble flow going to zero.\nDefinition 4 (\u1e59p \u2192 vrec ): A particle with coordinate\ntrajectory \u03c7(t) asymptotically rejoins the Hubble flow if\n\u1e59p \u2192 vrec (t) as t \u2192 \u221e.\nWe require that the proper velocity of the test particle approaches its recession velocity. This is subtly different from\ndefinition 3, as will be explained below. To avoid ambiguity, this definition uses a continuous version of asymptotic\nequivalence: we say that f (x) approaches g(x) as x \u2192 \u221e if\ntheir ratio approaches unity, i.e.\nf (x) \u2192 g(x) as x \u2192 \u221e\n\n\u21d4\n\nf (x)\n\u2192 1 as x \u2192 \u221e\ng(x)\n\n(15)\n\nDefinition 5 (\u2206rp \u2192 0): A particle with coordinate\ntrajectory \u03c7(t), where \u03c7(t) \u2192 \u03c7\u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, asymptotically\nrejoins the Hubble flow if \u2206rp \u2261 |R(t)\u03c7\u221e \u2212 R(t)\u03c7(t)| \u2192 0\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\nSuppose that our test particle is approaching a particular\ncoordinate (\u03c7 = \u03c7\u221e , cf. definition 2) and that we place a\nreference particle in the Hubble flow at this coordinate. We\n\nLight emitted from a particle in the Hubble flow is observed\nto be redshifted according to the cosmological redshift formula: zcosm \u2261 R(tr )/R(te ) \u2212 1. For a particle with coordinate trajectory \u03c7(t), there is an additional Doppler redshift\nresulting from its velocity relative to the Hubble flow:\n1 + zobs (tr ) = (1 + zcosm )(1 + zDop )\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00131\nR(tr )\n1 + vpec (te ) 2\n=\nR(te )\n1 \u2212 vpec (te )\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nwhere vpec is considered positive when the particle's velocity\nthrough the local Hubble flow points away from us. The\nDoppler term is the familiar redshift of light formula from\nSR, but the formula is derived purely from the RW metric.\nThis definition assumes that we are comoving observers\nthat measure light signals sent from the test particle. Suppose at each time we place a reference particle in the Hubble\nflow at the same coordinate as the test particle. The redshift\nof the reference particle, which represents the local Hubble\nflow, will be purely cosmological. This definition requires\nthat the redshift of the test particle approach the redshift\nof the reference particle.\nDefinition 7 (CMB dipole \u2192 0): A particle moving\nthrough a universe containing a cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) asymptotically rejoins the Hubble flow\nif the dipole anisotropy in the CMB goes to zero as t \u2192 \u221e.\nIn a universe filled with black-body radiation at a certain\ntemperature T , an observer moving through the Hubble flow\nwill see the CMB to be hotter in one direction and colder in\nthe opposite direction. Indeed, this is exactly what we see\nfrom Earth-it is known as the \"great cosine in the sky\"\nand disrupts the isotropy of the CMB at a level of \u223c 10\u22123\n(Bennett et al. 2003, among others). The maximum difference between the temperature as measured by an observer\nin the Hubble flow (T0 ) and our test particle with peculiar\nvelocity vpec << c is given by (Peebles & Wilkinson 1968;\nMelchiorri, Melchiorri, & Signore 2002):\n\u2206T\nvpec\n\u223c\n.\nT0\nc\n\n(18)\n\nFinally, note that it is too much to ask that the test\nparticle exactly join the Hubble flow after some time, i.e.\n\u03c7(t) = \u03c7f , a constant, for all t > tf . Only pathological functions that do not equal their own Taylor series can do this,\nand it is unlikely that such functions will appear as a solution to the geodesic equations (9).\n\n\f6\n\nBarnes, Francis, James and Lewis\n\n4.2\n\nComparing the Definitions\n\nThe previous section may appear to be an exercise in pedantic cosmology, and one hopes that all the definitions will\nturn out to be equivalent. However, it turns out that only\nthree of the above definitions hold in eternally expanding\nbut otherwise arbitrary universes, and one of them fails in\nall non-accelerating universes.\nWe will need two key results in order to analyse these\ndefinitions. The first is that all eternally expanding cosmological models approach the single component model of\nEquation (5) as t \u2192 \u221e. We can show this directly from\nEquation (4). Consider the universe to contain a number of\nenergy components (labelled i), each with constant5 equation of state wi . Now consider the right hand side of Equation (4). As t \u2192 \u221e, we know that R(t) \u2192 \u221e since we\nare only considering eternally expanding universes. Since\nthe dependence on R(t) is R\u22123(1+wi ) , we see that, for large\nt, the component with the most negative equation of state\nwill dominate the dynamics of the universe. Precisely, let\nthe component with the most negative equation of state be\ncalled the dominant component (i = d), with equation of\nstate wd . Then, for large t\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22123(1+wd )\nR\nH 2 \u2248 H02 \u03a9d,0\n(19)\nR0\n\u0012 \u0013 2\nt 3(1+wd )\n\u21d2 R(t) \u2248 R0\n(20)\nt0\nwhich is Equation (5) with w = wd . For example, in a universe with matter density less than critical, we consider\n\"curvature energy\" to be the dominant component with\nwd = \u22121/3. The exact solution for this cosmology (given\nin Hobson, Efstathiou, & Lasenby (2005), pg. 402) indeed\nshows that R(t) \u221d t for large t. Thus, Equation (20) is a\ngeneral form for R(t) when considering the asymptotic behaviour of the universe6 . We can also calculate the deceleration parameter, q:\nR\u0308 1\n1\nq\u2261\u2212\n= (3wd + 1)\n(21)\nR H2\n2\nThus, if wd > \u22121/3 then the expansion of universe will\ndecelerate; if wd < \u22121/3, then the universe will eventually\naccelerate; if wd = \u22121/3 then the universe will approach a\ncoasting universe.\nThe second key result is the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe integral for \u03c7 in Equation (10b) when R(t) given by\nEquation (20). Whilst the exact indefinite integral unfortunately involves the hypergeometric function, we can approximate this function in the limit of large t as by noting that\n5\n\nFor a component with an evolving equation of state, consider\nthe asymptotic value of the equation of state, i.e. wi (t) \u2192 wi,\u221e as\nt \u2192 \u221e. A unbounded equation of state is most likely unphysical.\nAn oscillating equation of state will not be considered.\n6 There is a subtlety here-a universe that contains only \"curvature energy\" (i.e. an empty universe) is not identical to a universe containing a critical density fluid with equation of state\nw = \u22121/3. Although the dependence of the scale factor on time\nis the same in both universes (R(t) \u221d t), the empty universe\nhas k = \u22121, whilst the w = \u22121/3 fluid universe has k = 0.\nHowever, Equations (9) show that if we consider radial geodesics\n(\u03b8 \u2032 = \u03c6\u2032 = 0), then there is no dependence on k. Thus, the distinction between these two universes can be ignored for now.\n\n\u221a\n1 + CR2 \u2248 CR in this limit. The integral then becomes\ntrivial. We now analyse the seven definitions, in order from\nthe weakest to the strongest conditions.\nDefinition 1 (\u03c7\u0307 \u2192 0): From Equation (10b) we can\nsee that as t \u2192 \u221e (and R(t) \u2192 \u221e), \u03c7\u0307 \u221d R\u22122 . Thus Definition 1 holds in all eternally expanding universes, so that\nthe velocity of a particle through coordinate space will always decay to zero. Gr\u00f8n & Elgar\u00f8y (2006) use this definition when they claim that test particles will rejoin the\nHubble flow.\nDefinition 3 (vpec \u2192 0): Since vpec (t) = R(t)\u03c7\u0307(t),\nDefinition 3 is stronger than Definition 1. However, it still\nholds in all eternally expanding universes, since Equation\n(10b) shows that as t \u2192 \u221e, vpec (t) \u221d R\u22121 . This is closely\nrelated to the well known result that the momentum of any\nparticle in the universe decays as R\u22121 . It is this definition\nthat is most widely used to justify the claim that test particles rejoin the Hubble flow asymptotically.\nDefinition 7 (CMB dipole \u2192 0): Equation (18) shows\nthat this definition is equivalent to Definition 3 and thus\nholds in all eternally expanding universes. In particular, this\nshows that the dipole in the CMB will decay faster than the\nCMB temperature itself.\nDefinition 2 (\u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u221e ): At first sight, Definition 2\nmay appear to be a direct consequence of Definition 1-\nsurely if the derivative of a function approaches zero then\nthe function itself will approach a constant. However, it is\neasy to think of counterexamples: f (x) = log(x). Thus, we\nneed to consider Equation (10b), integrating between t0 = 1\nand t and using the two approximations discussed at the\nstart of this section. This gives:\nZ t\ndt\n\u221a\n\u03c7(t) =\u03c70 \u00b1\n(22)\n2\n1 R 1 + CR\nZ t\ndt\n1\n\u2248K1 \u00b1 \u221a\n(23)\nt2n\nCR02\n\u221a\n\n2\nwhere n = 3(1+w\nand K1 is a constant that includes \u03c70\nd)\nand the primitive of the exact integral evaluated at t0 . Thus,\nfor the integral to be bounded as t \u2192 \u221e, we require that:\n\n2n > 1\n\n\u21d2\n\nwd < 1/3\n\n(24)\n\nThus if we use Definition 2 to define what it means to asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow, then test particles in universes where the dominant energy component has equation\nof state wd > 1/3 do not rejoin the Hubble flow. In particular, in a universe where the dominant energy component\nis radiation, the comoving coordinate of a test particle removed from the Hubble flow increases (or decreases) without bound. The particle has no rightful place in the Hubble\nflow7 .\nDefinition 4 (\u1e59p \u2192 vrec ): Definition 4 appears to be\nidentical to Definition 3; surely if \u1e59p (t) = vrec (t)+vpec (t) and\nvpec (t) \u2192 0 in all eternally expanding universes then Definition 4 holds trivially. However, it is possible that vrec (t) also\n7\n\nHartle (2003) sets the derivation of Equation (10b) as a practice\nproblem for undergraduates. The solutions give a very instructive\nderivation using Killing vectors, but then state that the particle\ncomes to rest at coordinate xf \u2261 \u03c7\u221e , given by integrating from\nzero to infinity. He fails to note that the integral may diverge, so\nthat the particle may not come to rest at all.\n\n\fJoining the Hubble Flow\ngoes to zero, and if it does so as fast or faster than vpec (t)\nthen we are not justified in saying that the proper velocity\nof the test particle approaches its recession velocity. We can\nsee this from Equation (15):\n\u1e59p (t) \u2192 vrec (t)\n\n\u21d2\n\u21d2\n\u21d2\n\n\u1e59p (t)\n\u21921\nvrec (t)\nvrec (t) + vpec (t)\n\u21921\nvrec (t)\nvpec (t)\n\u21920\nvrec (t)\n\n(25)\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhich is stronger than the condition in Definition 3. Whiting\n(2004, page 11) hinted at Definition 4: \"Peculiar velocities do vanish eventually in expanding universes; but so do\nall velocities [emphasis original]\", but mistakenly implied\nthat it would rule out rejoining the Hubble flow in matter\ndominated universes (wd = 0). Davis, Lineweaver, & Webb\n(2001) use Definition 4 (see their equation (11) and following) but mistakenly believe that it follows automatically\nfrom the success of Definition 3.\nAs we noted previously, as t \u2192 \u221e, vpec (t) \u221d R\u22121 . Thus:\nvpec (t) \u221d R\n\n\u22121\n\n\u221dt\n\n\u2212n\n\n(28)\n\nWe now consider vrec (t) = \u1e58(t)\u03c7(t). Using Equation (23) we\napproximate \u03c7 by:\n( 1\u22122n\nt\nif n 6= 1/2\n1\n1\u22122n\n\u03c7(t) \u2248 K1 \u00b1 \u221a\n(29)\n2\nif n = 1/2\nCR0 log t\n(\nt\u2212n\nif n 6= 1/2\nn\u22121\n\u21d2 vrec (t) \u221d K2 t\n+ K3 \u22121/2\n(30)\nt\nlog t if n = 1/2\nwhere the Ki will be used keep track of constants. Now, we\nneed to consider three cases:\n\u2022 If n > 1/2, then n \u2212 1 > \u2212n . Thus the dominant term\nin Equation (30) is the first term so that vrec (t) \u221d tn\u22121 for\nlarge t. Then, as t \u2192 \u221e:\nt\u2212n\nvpec (t)\n\u221d n\u22121 \u2192 0\nvrec (t)\nt\n\n(31)\n\nThus when n > 1/2, vpec (t) goes to zero faster than vrec (t),\nmeaning that Definition 4 holds.\n\u2022 If n = 1/2, then vrec (t) \u221d t\u22121/2 log t. Then, as t \u2192 \u221e:\nvpec (t)\nt\u22121/2\n\u221d \u22121/2\n\u21920\nvrec (t)\nt\nlog t\n\n(32)\n\nThus Definition 4 holds when n = 1/2.\n\u2022 If n < 1/2, then n \u2212 1 < \u2212n so that vrec (t) \u221d t\u2212n .\nThen, as t \u2192 \u221e:\nt\u2212n\nvpec (t)\n\u221d \u2212n \u2192 1\nvrec (t)\nt\n\n(33)\n\nThus when n < 1/2, vrec (t) and vrec (t) approach zero at the\nsame rate. It is not true that \u1e59p (t) \u2192 vrec (t) as t \u2192 \u221e and\nDefinition 4 fails in this case.\nIf we use Definition 4 to define what it means to asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow, then test particles in universes where the dominant energy component has equation\nof state wd > 1/3 do not rejoin the Hubble flow. Note that\nDefinition 4 holds in a universe where the dominant energy\ncomponent is radiation, unlike Definition 2, which fails.\n\n7\n\nDefinition 6 (zobs \u2192 zcosm ): Once again we are\ntempted to assume that the success of Definition 3 will ensure that this definition will hold in all universes. The argument proceeds as before: if\n\u00131\n\u0012\n1 + vpec (te ) 2\n(34)\n1 + zDop =\n1 \u2212 vpec (te )\nand vpec (t) \u2192 0 in all eternally expanding universes then\nDefinition 6 holds trivially. And our caveat is the same-we\nmust be careful of the case where zcosm also goes to zero.\nTo do this, we need to express zobs in terms of reception\ntime tr and then consider the limit tr \u2192 \u221e. In fact it is much\neasier to express everything in terms of the emission time te\nand then consider te \u2192 \u221e; te < tr guarantees that both\ncases will have identical limiting behaviour.\nIn the limit of small vpec , we have that zDop \u223c vpec \u221d\ntn\nr)\nt\u2212n , using Equation (28). Also, 1 + zcosm = R(t\n= tnr , so\nR(te )\ne\nthat the task at hand is to express tr in terms of te . Consider\na light ray travelling along a null (ds = 0), ingoing (d\u03c7 < 0),\nradial (d\u03b8 = d\u03c6 = 0) geodesic. From the RW metric:\ndt = \u2212 R(t)d\u03c7\nZ tr\ndt\n\u21d2 \u03c7(te ) \u2212 \u03c7(tr ) =\nte R(t)\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nwhere we now place the receiver at the origin: \u03c7(tr ) = 0. For\nthe case of a test particle moved removed from the Hubble flow, \u03c7(te ) is given by Equation (10b), approximated\nby Equation (29). An immediate consequence of combining\nthese equations is that Definition 6 must work in accelerating and coasting universes (wd 6 \u22121/3), since in these\nuniverses zcosm does not go to zero. Thus we need only consider 0 < n < 1. We will leave the n = 1/2 case to the\nreader: it involves log t as with Definition 4.\nWith this in mind, we can derive an expression for tr :\n\u0001 1\ntr = t1\u2212n\n+ K4 te1\u22122n + K5 1\u2212n\n(37)\ne\n\nwhich leads to the following expression for 1 + zcosm :\n\u0010\n\u0011 n\n1\u2212n\n1 + zcosm = 1 + K4 t\u2212n\n+ K5 t\u2212(1\u2212n)\ne\ne\n\u22481 +\n\nK6 t\u2212n\ne\n\n+\n\nK7 t\u2212(1\u2212n)\ne\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nwhere the last expression is calculated using the binomial\ntheorem for non-integer exponents8 . This leads to the following three cases:\n\u2022 If n > 1/2, then n\u22121 > \u2212n so that zcosm \u221d tn\u22121 . Then,\nas t \u2192 \u221e:\nt\u2212n\nzDop\n\u221d n\u22121 \u2192 0\nzcosm\nt\n\n(40)\n\nThus when n > 1/2, zDop goes to zero faster than zcosm ,\nmeaning that Definition 6 holds.\n\u2022 If n = 1/2, it turns out that zcosm \u221d t\u22121/2 log t. Then,\nas t \u2192 \u221e:\nzDop\nt\u22121/2\n\u221d \u22121/2\n\u21920\nzcosm\nt\nlog t\n\nThus Definition 4 holds when n = 1/2.\n8\n\nSee Weisstein (2006) for a reminder.\n\n(41)\n\n\f8\n\nBarnes, Francis, James and Lewis\n0.07\n\n0.035\n\n0.06\n\nw=0\n\n0.03\n0.025\n\nredshift (z)\n\nredshift (z)\n\n0.05\n\nw=1\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\n0.02\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ntime (t)\n\ntime (t)\n\nFigure 3. Redshift as a function of time for cosmological models with w = 0 (left) and w = 1 (right) (examples of fluids with w = 1 are free\nmassless scalar fields and shear energy, such as superhorizon gravitational waves; see Linder (1997)). The dashed line is the cosmological\nredshift (zcosm ), the dotted line is the Doppler redshift (zDop ) and the solid line is the observed redshift (zobs = \u22121+(1+zcosm )(1+zDop )).\nThe left panel shows the asymptotic dominance of the cosmological redshift for w 6 1/3, whilst the right panel shows the identical\nasymptotic behaviour of the cosmological and Doppler redshift at large t for w > 1/3.\n\n\u2022 If n < 1/2, then n \u2212 1 < \u2212n so that zcosm \u221d t\u2212n .

It is not true that zobs \u2192 zcosm and Definition 6\nfails in this case.\nIf we use Definition 6 to define what it means to asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow, then test particles in universes where the dominant energy component has equation\nof state wd > 1/3 do not rejoin the Hubble flow. The situation is illustrated in Figure 3. When w = 0 the Doppler redshift decays away much faster than the cosmological redshift,\nso that Definition 6 holds. However, when w = 1 the Doppler\nand the cosmological redshift decay at the same rate; which\none is greater depends on the cosmological model and the\ninitial conditions (hidden in the constants Ki ). Thus, Definition 6 fails in this universe.\nDefinition 5 (\u2206rp \u2192 0): We know already that this\ndefinition fails in some cases since it relies on Definition 2.\nThus we begin with the assumption that wd < 1/3, i.e.\nn > 1/2. Now, we have that:\n\u2206rp =|R(t)\u03c7\u221e \u2212 R(t)\u03c7(t)|\nZ \u221e\nZ t\ndt\ndt\n\u221a\n\u221a\n=R(t)\n\u2212\n2\n2\nt0 R 1 + CR\nt0 R 1 + CR\nZ \u221e\ndt\n\u221a\n=R(t)\nR 1 + CR2\nt\nZ \u221e\ndt\n\u221d tn\n2n\nt\nt\nn\n\n\u221dt t\n\n1\u22122n\n\n=t\n\n1\u2212n\n\n(43)\n\npage 10 reaches this conclusion for an underdense, matter\nonly universe. If we use Definition 5 to define what it means\nto asymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow, then test particles in universes where the dominant energy component has\nequation of state wd > \u22121/3 do not rejoin the Hubble flow.\nThis means that particles asymptotically rejoin the Hubble\nflow only in universes that eventually accelerate. Definition\n5 is the strongest of the definitions, and is the one used by\nWhiting (2004), page 10, to justify the claim that particles\nin a matter dominated universe (wd = 0) do not join the\nHubble flow.\nThe failure of this definition can be illustrated by looking again at Figure 1. The first column (w = \u22122/3) clearly\nshows a particle that satisfies Definition 5. However, in the\nsecond and third columns (w = \u22121/3, 0), in the bottom panels, the lowest dashed line is the trajectory of the particle\nin the Hubble flow whose comoving coordinate is equal to\n\u03c7\u221e , i.e. the rightful place of the particle in the Hubble flow.\nIn the centre column, the test particle trajectory and the\nrightful place trajectory move apart, whilst in the second\ncolumn they are separated by a constant. Thus, the particle never joins the Hubble flow in the sense of its trajectory\nbeing indistinguishable from the trajectory of a particle in\nthe Hubble flow.\nA summary of the different definitions and the conditions for their fulfilment is given in Table 1.\n\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n(47)\n\nHence the requirement that \u2206rp \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e is only\nmet for n > 1, i.e. wd < \u22121/3 or q < 0. In particular, for\na universe where the dominant component has wd = \u22121/3,\n\u2206rp approaches a constant. For example, Whiting (2004),\n\n5\n\nPARTICLE MOTION, THE HUBBLE FLOW\nAND EXPANDING SPACE\n\nThe attack on the physical concept of expanding space has\ncentred on the motion of test particles in the universe, as\ndiscussed in Section 3. Whiting (2004), Peacock (2006) and\nothers claim expanding space fails to adequately explain test\nparticle motion because we expect that expanding space will\ncarry the particle away from the origin, as stretching rubber\nwould carry the glowing ball of Section 3 away. Whilst we\n\n\fJoining the Hubble Flow\nTable 1.

Particles in\nthe Hubble flow do not feel any force, as they are free-falling.\nThus, thinking of expanding space as a frictional or viscous\nforce (like objects on a rubber sheet) is incorrect.\nFinally, how are we to understand the failure of so many\nof the definitions of joining the Hubble flow in Section (4)?\nWe contend that expanding space predicts that the peculiar\nvelocity of a test particle will approach zero (Peacock 2006):\nthrough the accumulated Lorentz transforms required to overtake successively more distant particles that are moving with the\nHubble flow.\n\nThus we expect Definition 3 (along with Definitions 3 and 7,\nwhich are weaker or equivalent conditions) to hold in all eternally expanding universes. However, expanding space does\nnot lead us to expect that Definitions 2, 4, 5 and 6 will hold.\nWe contend that the problem is not that expanding space\nhas mislead us, but that describing the decay of vpec as joining the Hubble flow is a misnomer. The correspondence between this particular characteristic of the trajectory of the\ntest particle and the trajectory of particles in the Hubble\nflow leads us to expect that all of the features of the trajectory (\u03c7, \u03c7\u0307, rp , \u1e59p , vpec ) will approach those of the Hubble\nflow trajectories (respectively, \u03c7 = \u03c7\u221e , \u03c7\u0307 = 0, rp = R(t)\u03c7\u221e ,\n\u1e59p = vrec , vpec = 0). But this is too much to ask from the\nexpansion of the universe. As we have seen, many of these\nconditions depend on the acceleration and deceleration of\nthe universe, rather than just its expansion.\nWe contend that the correct definition of asymptotically rejoining the Hubble flow is that all the features of the\ntest particle trajectory approach the corresponding features\nof the Hubble flow trajectories. Selecting one feature of the\ntrajectory on which to base our definition is arbitrary and\nleads to a multitude of conflicting claims. All seven definitions have equal claim to the title of the definition of joining\nthe Hubble flow. We therefore require that all definitions\nhold, which is equivalent to just requiring Definition 5 to\nhold, as it is the strongest definition. It follows that it is not\na general feature of expanding universes that test particles\nasymptotically rejoin the Hubble flow.\n\n9\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nLAB and JBJ are supported by an Australian Postgraduate Award.
