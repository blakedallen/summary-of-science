Galaxies: dwarf; Galaxies: ISM; (ISM:) dust; Infrared: ISM\n\n1. Introduction\nLate-type dwarf galaxies are metal-poor systems, and they represent unique environments to investigate the properties of dust\nin the low-metallicity regime. Mid/far-infrared (MIR/FIR) and\nsubmillimetre (submm) observations have provided information\nabout the different dust components in dwarfs, showing that\neven metal-poor galaxies may host a significant amount of dust\n(Thuan et al. 1999; Houck et al. 2004; Engelbracht et al. 2008).\nWhile the majority of the studies to date have focused mainly\non bright and isolated dwarfs (Galliano et al. 2003; Hunt et al.\n2005; Galliano et al. 2005; Galametz et al. 2009), little is known\nabout the interplay between the environment and the dust properties of low-mass and low-metallicity systems.\nIt is still unclear whether most of the dust mass in these\nsystems is at very low temperature (T <\n\u223c 10 K), as the excess\nemission in the submm observed in some dwarfs might suggest (Madden 2002; Galliano et al. 2005; Galametz et al. 2009).\nThis cold dust component may either be associated with the\nstar-forming regions, residing in clumpy molecular complexes\n(Galliano et al. 2003), or extend beyond the optical disc following the distribution of the neutral hydrogen (Hi; Popescu et al.\n2002). However, the main objection to this interpretation is the\nhigh dust mass associated with the cold dust, and alternative explanations have been proposed (see Bendo et al. 2010, and references therein). For example, Lisenfeld et al. (2002) used a mixed\ndust model (Desert et al. 1990) of large and small grains, finding\nthat a high abundance of small grains (compared to the Milky\nWay) with a shallow emissivity (\u03b2 < 2) may account for the excess submm emission in NGC 1569. Zhu et al. (2009) applied a\nsimilar approach to the starburst spiral galaxy NGC 3310 with\u22c6\n\nHerschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments\nprovided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.\n\nout introducing a cold dust component. Only additional measurements in the FIR/submm regime and the analysis of a larger\nsample of galaxies can help us properly assess the issue of dust\nat low temperatures.\nThe Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010) allows us for the first time to study the wavelength range between 200 and 500 \u03bcm, where the emission from cold dust is\nexpected to be the most prominent. As part of the Herschel\nOpen Time Key Project, the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey1\n(HeViCS; Davies et al. 2010) will map an area of 64 square\ndegrees of the Virgo cluster with PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010)\nand SPIRE (Griffin et al. 2010) to investigate the dust content of\nthe different morphological types within the cluster. The dwarf\ngalaxy population of the Virgo cluster is dominated by dwarf\nellipticals, but also contains a non-negligible fraction (\u223c 10%)\nof late-type dwarfs with signs of current star formation activity\n(Binggeli et al. 1987). In this Letter, we present the dust properties of three of these galaxies detected with PACS and SPIRE\nin the HeViCS Science Demonstration Phase (SDP) data set, a\n4\u25e6 \u00d7 4\u25e6 field covering the central region of the cluster.\n\n2. Sample selection\nThe HeViCS SDP field contains 28 late-type low-luminosity\ngalaxies classified in the Virgo Cluster Catalog (VCC,\nBinggeli et al. 1985) as Sm (7), Im (12), blue compact dwarfs\n(BCDs) (6), and dwarf irregulars (3). Three of the BCDs have\nbeen detected with PACS and SPIRE and are analysed in this\nwork: VCC 562, VCC 1179, and VCC 1356. They have B magnitudes between 15.5 and 16.7 (MB between \u221214.5 and \u221215.6),\nand Hi masses of 107 \u2212 108 M\u2299 assuming a distance to Virgo\nof 16.5 Mpc (Mei et al. 2007). We inferred star-formation rates\n1\n\nhttp://www.hevics.org\n\n\f2\n\nM. Grossi et al.: The Herschel Virgo cluster survey: V. Star-forming dwarf galaxies - dust in metal-poor environments\n\nFig. 1. SDSS and Herschel images of VCC 562, VCC 1179, and VCC 1356 at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \u03bcm. The field size is\n150\u2032\u2032. The FWHM of the beam at each wavelength is displayed at the bottom-right corner. The different shape of the PACS beams\ndepend on the single-scan (ellipse) or crossed-link scan (circle) coverage of the area.\n(SFRs) of between 10\u22121 and 10\u22122 M\u2299 yr\u22121 from extinctioncorrected H\u03b1 and UV fluxes (Gavazzi et al. 2004; Boselli et al.\n2009). Although these dwarfs are compact, thus classified as\nBCDs by Binggeli et al. (1985), their SFRs are lower than the\ntypical values for BCDs (Hunter & Elmegreen 2004; Zitrin et al.\n2009). Metallicities were estimated using the Sloan Digitised\nSky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic database (York et al. 2000).\nSince the [Oii] \u03bb3727 nebular line is outside the observed wavelength range of the SDSS spectra, we estimated the oxygen\nabundances following the method of Pilyugin & Thuan (2007).\nOur estimates agree, within the errors, with the measurements available in the literature for VCC 5622 and VCC 1179\n(V\u0131\u0301lchez & Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo 2003). The basic parameters of the\nthree galaxies are given in Table 1.\nAmong the Sm and Im types, only one bright IBm galaxy,\nIC3583 (VCC 1686), was detected in the SDP field, but given its\ndifferent properties from the three dwarfs, it will be analysed in\nmore detail in a separate work.\n\nFigure 1 compares PACS and SPIRE data of the three dwarfs\nto the SDSS images. VCC 1179 is not detected at 100 \u03bcm, nor\nVCC 562 at 500 \u03bcm. The other galaxies are marginally detected\nat 500 \u03bcm with a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) (4\u03c3 and 5\u03c3 for\nVCC 1179 and VCC 1356, respectively). The VCC 1179 images\nshow an additional feature to the north extending beyond the\nedge of the optical disc. It is not clear whether this feature is\nassociated with the galaxy or not, but it also does not seem to be\nrelated to any background source in the SDSS images.\nPhotometry from 100 to 500 \u03bcm was derived by means\nof the standard growth curve analysis. The aperture is centred on the brightness peak, and the sky level is determined\nby considering the value that minimizes the radial variation\nin successively larger apertures. At large radii, the photometry\nshould be relatively constant, and the asymptotic value corresponds to the total flux. The value of the sky thus derived is\nalways within 1.5 standard deviations of the sky background\nmeasured in empty regions around the galaxies. The uncertainty\nin the flux density is assumed to be 30% (Boselli et al. 2010;\nSwinyard, Ade, Baluteau, et al. 2010).\n\n3. Photometry\nThe SDP data were reduced using the Level I procedures described in Pohlen et al. (2010). More details on the observations\ncan be found in Davies et al. (2010). The angular resolution for\nPACS in fast scan parallel mode is 7\u2032\u2032\u00d712.\u2032\u2032 7 and 11.\u2032\u2032 6\u00d715.\u2032\u2032 7, at\n100, and 160 \u03bcm, respectively. For SPIRE, the PSF FWHM is\n18.\u2032\u2032 1, 25.\u2032\u2032 2, and 36.\u2032\u2032 9 at 250, 350, and 500 \u03bcm respectively.\nPixel sizes are 3.\u2032\u2032 2, 6.\u2032\u2032 4, 6\u2032\u2032, 10\u2032\u2032, and 14\u2032\u2032 for the five bands.\nThe rms levels of empty sky regions at 100, 160, 250, 350,\nand 500 \u03bcm are \u223c2 mJy pix\u22121 , \u223c5 mJy pix\u22121 , \u223c8 mJy beam\u22121 ,\n\u223c7 mJy beam\u22121 , and \u223c9 mJy beam\u22121 , respectively.\n2\n\nNote that according to V\u0131\u0301lchez & Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo (2003) the uncertainties in the measurement of VCC 562 are also compatible with a\nhigher metal abundance, 12 + log(O/H)=8.4-8.6.\n\n4. Dust temperatures and masses\nTo derive the temperatures of the dust, we fitted the\nPACS+SPIRE SEDs with a single modified Planck function and\nan emissivity law k\u03bd \u221d \u03bd2 (Fig. 2, upper panels). We constrained\nthe dust masses using the 250 \u03bcm flux densities, and the emissivity k\u03bd = 4.67 cm2 g\u22121 at 250 \u03bcm (Li & Draine 2001). The\nresulting dust masses are approximately 105 M\u2299 , and the dust\ntemperatures are around 20 K (see Table 1).\nHowever, Fig. 2 shows that 500 \u03bcm fluxes of VCC 1179 and\nVCC 1356 tend to be underestimated by the single-temperature\nfits. This difference could be due to either thermal or nonthermal radio emission (Condon 1992; Hunt et al. 2005), an\nadditional cold (\u223c10 K) dust component (Galliano et al. 2003;\n\n\fM.

Because of the steep frequency fall-off\nof the non-thermal radio component toward higher frequencies\n(\u223c \u03bd\u22120.8 ), the estimated thermal flux at 500 \u03bcm is higher than the\nnon-thermal one by a factor of \u223c9. Nevertheless, in both cases,\n\u22121\n\u22121\ngiven the low SFR of these BCDs (<\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 yr ), the expected\nradio flux at 500 \u03bcm is of the order of 200 \u03bcJy, and thus cannot\nbe responsible for the 500 \u03bcm excess.\nThe emission from an additional cold dust component,\n\u223c10 K, would peak between 200 and 300 \u03bcm and could cause\nthe excess we observe at 500 \u03bcm. To explore this possibility,\nwe refined the fiducial SED model by adding a second modified black body at a lower temperature. For this two-component\ngrey-body fit, we also used \u03b2 = 2. Since we have four points in\nthe SED of VCC 1179 and the uncertainties in the flux densities\nare large, the fit could not be tightly constrained, and we discuss\nonly the results obtained for VCC 1356. More than one set of\nparameters were able to provide a reasonable fit to the SED of\nthis galaxy. We inferred mean temperatures of Tc = 8 K and Tw\n= 19.1 K for the two dust components and the fit for these values\nis displayed in Fig. 2 (lower panel). The corresponding total dust\nmass is Md = 1.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . This high mass is inconsistent with\ncurrent chemical evolution models (see next section). The least\nextreme value of cold dust temperatures providing a reasonable\nfit (Tc =11 K, with Tw = 19.6 K) still yields a total dust mass\nMd = 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , which is six times higher than the value for\nsingle-temperature fit. Fitting the data with a more sophisticated\ndust model to test alternative explanations is beyond the scope of\nthis Letter; this analysis will be performed in a future work when\nthe observations of the field are completed. At this stage, given\nthe low S/N of the detections at 500 \u03bcm and the large error bars,\nit is difficult to discriminate between the different scenarios.\n\n7.67\u00b10.03\n7.39\u00b10.06\n8.35\u00b10.01\n\nT1BB\nd\nK\n20.2\u00b10.2\n16.2\u00b10.6\n17.9\u00b11.1\n\nlog(Md /M\u2299 )\n\nlog(D )\n\n5.18\u00b10.13\n5.48\u00b10.14\n5.53\u00b10.16\n\n-2.49\u00b10.13\n-1.91\u00b10.15\n-2.82\u00b10.16\n\n2008, see Table 1). The angular resolution of the 21-cm data\n(3\u2032.3 \u00d7 3\u2032.8) includes all dust emission detected in these objects.\nWe assume the total gas mass is given by the atomic component\nonly: independent of the lack of CO detections, this assumption is justified by the low H2 -to-Hi mass fractions expected\nin metal-poor environments (e.g., Robertson & Kravtsov 2008;\nKrumholz et al. 2009a,b).\nThe resulting values of D are reported in Table 1. Figure 3\nshows D for the Virgo BCDs (filled circles) as a function of nebular oxygen abundance. Also illustrated in Fig. 3 are data from\nthe literature (James et al. 2002; Hunt et al. 2005; Walter et al.\n2007). Selected model predictions for the D -metallicity correlation are also shown (Edmunds 2001; Hirashita et al. 2002).\nThe Hirashita et al. (2002) models, shown as long-dashed and\ndot-dashed curves, depend on the dust destruction efficiency,\nwhich begins to be effective when the oxygen abundance 12 +\nlog(O/H) \u223c 8. Were the interstellar dust mass an approximately constant fraction of the ISM metal abundance, as proposed by Edmunds (2001) and James et al. (2002), the relation\nbetween D and O/H would be linear. A solid line indicates their\nprediction for dust production by SNe, and the short-dashed\nline represents that by only evolved low- and intermediatemass stars. Alternatively, a non-linear trend is predicted by\nLisenfeld & Ferrara (1998) and Hirashita et al. (2002) because\nof the additional effects of outflows and dust destruction efficiency. The two most metal-poor objects plotted, I Zw 18 and\nSBS 0335\u2212052 (at 12 + log(O/H) \u223c7.2), have a very low dustto-gas ratio for their metallicity (Hunt et al. 2005), but are approximately consistent with linearity.\nOur estimates of D for the three dwarfs, based on the singletemperature fit of the data, are indeed consistent with what\nwould be expected by the linear models. If these galaxies hosted\na cold dust component with Tc < 11 K, as discussed in the previous section (and shown in Fig. 3), the corresponding D would\nbe much larger than the model predictions. In this case, a significant missing gaseous component (H2 , cold Hi), a few times more\nmassive than the amount of detected Hi, should be introduced to\nexplain this discrepancy.\n\n5. Dust-to-gas mass ratios\nThe dust-to-gas-mass ratio D (Mdust /Mgas ) not only provides\ninformation about the amount of metals that are locked in\ndust grains, but also provides an indication of the starformation history of a galaxy, reflecting the net balance between the formation and destruction of dust (Hirashita et al.\n2002). The ratio D is known to correlate with the oxygen abundance (Lisenfeld & Ferrara 1998; Edmunds 2001;\nHirashita et al. 2002; James et al. 2002). Here we check whether\nthe gas and dust masses we obtained for these galaxies in the\nVirgo cluster are compatible with the predictions of dust formation models.\nTo derive D, we used neutral hydrogen masses available\nfrom the ALFALFA catalog (Giovanelli et al. 2007; Kent et al.\n\n6. Comparison with far-IR properties of known\nstar-forming dwarfs\nThe brightest and most metal-poor BCDs, such as IZw18 and\nSBS 0335-052E, have been studied with Spitzer, and dust\nhas been detected even in these low abundance environments\n(Houck et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2007). While the SED peak of\nSBS 0335-052E is shifted to shorter wavelengths (\u03bb \u223c 28 \u03bcm;\nHouck et al. 2004), I Zw 18 has also been detected at 70 \u03bcm\n(Wu et al. 2007; Engelbracht et al. 2008), suggesting that a cool\ndust component might be present in this galaxy. Hunt et al.\n(2005) studied the global SEDs of seven BCDs showing that farIR emission in these galaxies peaks at or shortward of \u223c60 \u03bcm.\n\n\f4\n\nM. Grossi et al.: The Herschel Virgo cluster survey: V. Star-forming dwarf galaxies - dust in metal-poor environments\n\nFig. 2. SEDs of the VCC dwarfs compared to a single modified black body with emissivity index \u03b2 = 2 (top), and a twocomponent model fit with \u03b2 = 2, Tw = 19.1 K, Tc = 8 K for\nVCC 1356 (bottom).\nHowever, the dwarfs detected with Herschel are more\n\"quiescent\" than the typical BCDs analysed in these studies.\nWalter et al. (2007) observed a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies in the M 81 group with SFRs and metallicities more similar\nto the Virgo dwarfs. They derived dust masses and temperatures\nof the M 81 dwarfs using only the 70 and 160 \u03bcm Spitzer/MIPS\nbands. Their dust-to-gas mass ratios, taking into account the total Hi mass of the galaxies, are displayed in Fig. 3 (plus signs),\nand are about one order of magnitude smaller than those of the\nVirgo dwarfs with a similar metal abundance. Finally, six ImBCD galaxies in Virgo analysed with ISO data by Popescu et al.\n(2002) show similar properties to the dwarfs in the current work.\nIn particular, their 60-170 \u03bcm SEDs indicate the presence of\nwarm dust and a cooler component with a median temperature\n\u223c18 K, in agreement with our results. The resulting dust-to-gas\nmass ratios in a few cases are rather large, >\n\u223c0.1.\n\n7. Conclusions\nWe have presented PACS and SPIRE observations of three starforming dwarf galaxies in Virgo detected in the far-IR/submm\nregime with the science demonstration phase data set for the\nHeViCS survey. The data indicate the presence of cool dust with\n5\na temperature <\n\u223c20 K and dust masses around 10 M\u2299 . We have\ndiscussed the possibility that these galaxies host an additional\ncold (T <\n\u223c 10 K) component to explain the excess at 500 \u03bcm in\ntwo of the dwarfs. However, the low S/N of the 500 \u03bcm detections precludes us from drawing firm conclusions. The completion of the full area of the survey will enable us to place more\nstringent constraints on the dust content of star-forming dwarf\ngalaxies in a dense cluster environment.\n\nReferences\nBendo, G.
