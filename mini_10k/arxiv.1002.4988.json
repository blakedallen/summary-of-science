We study the large-scale structure formation in the Universe in the frame of scalartensor theories as an alternative to general relativity. We review briefly the Newtonian limit of\nnon-minimally coupled scalar-tensor theories and the evolution equations of the N -body system\nthat is appropriate to study large-scale structure formation in the Universe. We compute the\npower-spectrum of the universe at present epoch and show how the large-scale structure depends\non the scalar field contribution.\n\n1. Introduction\nDuring the last two decades high precision observations have established the existence of two\ncomponent of the universe. These are known as dark energy and dark matter. What are their\nfundamental nature? this one of the questions we need to answer[1]. One of the most succesful\nmodels to explain observations is the \u039bCDM but it still has some problems.\nIn the past we have proposed a dark matter model in the framework of the Newtonian limit of\na scalar-tensor theory[2]. We have done N -body simulations using a numerical code developed\nto take into account the scalar field (SF) force contribution which is of Yukawa type in its\nNewtonian limit and we have use it to study several situations, like collision of protogalaxies[3],\ndynamics and collision of galaxies[4, 5], and to study cosmological simulations[6, 7, 8]. Recently\nwe have used it to address a possible solution to two of the main problems the \u039bCDM has,\ni.e., the tendency to over populate the formed halos of galaxies with satellites and the flatness\nproblem[10, 11].\nSeveral authors have also been using similar dark matter models to study large-scale structure\nformation, see for instance[12, 13, 14].\nOne of the tools to characterize the clustering properties of a universe model is the power\nspectrum. Constraints on cosmological models and on cosmological parameters have been\nderived from measuring power spectrum. Therefore, in this work we consider a dark matter\nmodel build from the Newtonian limit of a scalar-tensor theory[2] and use it to study the largescale structure formation of the universe by analyzing the power-spectrum versus the parameters\nof the model.\n\n\f2. Evolution equations for a \u039bCMD universe within the framework of a\nscalar-tensor theory\nGiving that we are interested in the study of the large-scale structure formation of the universe\nwe will use the Newtonian limit of the scalar-tensor theory. This limit applies in a region small\ncompared to the Hubble length cH \u22121 , with c the speed of light and H the hubble factor, and\nlarge compared to the Schwarzschild radii of any collapsed objects.\nIn this case the Vlasov-Poisson equation in an expanding universe describes the evolution of\nthe six-dimensional, one-particle distribution function, f (x, p)[15]. The Vlasov equation is,\n\u2202f\np\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n+\n*\n\u2212 m\u2207\u03a6N (x) *\n=0\n2\n\u2202t\nma \u2202x\n\u2202p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the comoving coordinate, p = ma2 \u1e8b, m is the particle mass, and \u03a6N is the selfconsistent gravitational potential given by the Poisson equation,\n\u22072 \u03a6N (x) = 4\u03c0GN a2 [\u03c1(x) \u2212 \u03c1b (t)]]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1b is the background mass density. Eqs. (1) and (2) form the Vlasov-Poisson equation,\nconstitutes a collisionless, mean-field approximation to the evolution of the full N -body\ndistribution. An N -body code attempts to solve Eqs. (1) and (2) by representing the oneparticle distribution function as\nf (x, p) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 xi ) \u03b4(p \u2212 pi )\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nSubstitution of (3) in the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations yields the exact Newton's equations\nfor a system of N gravitating particles.\nIn the Newtonian limit of STT of gravity, the Newtonian motion equation for a particle i is\nwritten as[7]\n1 GN X mj (xi \u2212 xj )\nFSF (|xi \u2212 xj |, \u03b1, \u03bb)\n(4)\n\u1e8di + 2 H xi = \u2212 3\na 1 + \u03b1 j6=i |xi \u2212 xj |3\nwhere the sum includes all periodic images of particle j, and FSF (r, \u03b1, \u03bb) is\n\u0012\n\nFSF (r, \u03b1, \u03bb) = 1 + \u03b1 1 +\n\nr\n\u03bb\n\n\u0013\n\ne\u2212r/\u03bb\n\n(5)\n\nwhich, for small distances compared to \u03bb, is FSF (r \u226a \u03bb, \u03b1, \u03bb) \u2248 1 + \u03b1 1 + \u03bbr and, for long\ndistances, is FSF (r \u226b \u03bb, \u03b1, \u03bb) \u2248 1, as in Newtonian physics.\nTo simulate cosmological systems, the expansion of the universe has to be taken into account.\nAlso, to determine the nature of the cosmological model we need to determine the composition\nof the universe, i. e., we need to give the values of \u03a9i for each component i, taking into account\nin this way all forms of energy densities that exist at present.\nIn this work we will consider a model with only two energy density contribution. One which is\na pressureless and nonbaryonic dark matter with \u03a9DM \u2248 0.3 that does not couple with radiation.\nOther, that will be a cosmological constant contribution \u03a9\u039b \u2248 0.7. Also, the model must be\nconsistent with a static SF according to the Newtonian limit we are using in this work. Thus,\nthe scale factor, a(t), is given by the following Friedman model[8],\n\u0001\n\n3\n\n2\n\na H =\n\nH02\n\n\"\n\n\u03a9DM 0 + \u03a9\u039b0\n\u03a9DM 0 + \u03a9\u039b0 a3\n+ 1\u2212\n1+\u03b1\n1+\u03b1\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 #\n\na\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a, \u03a9DM 0 and \u03a9\u039b0 are the matter and energy density evaluated at present,\nrespectively. We have also demanded that the universe be a flat one. To be consistent with\nthe CMB spectrum and structure formation numerical experiments, cosmological constraints\nmust be applied on \u03b1 in order for it to be within the range (\u22121, 1) [16, 17, 18, 19].\n\n\f10-2\n\nP(k)\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n\n\u03b1=0\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b1=-1/2\n\u03b1=-1/4\n\n10-5\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\nk L/2 \u03c0\nFigure 1.

Results\nIn this section, we present results of cosmological simulations of a \u039bCDM universe with and\nwithout SF contribution. We start our simulations with an initial distribution of N = 2 \u00d7 323\nparticles in a box with sides of L = 50h\u22121 Mpc at z = 10. This case is similar to the one that\ncomes with Gadget 1 [20]. At present epoch, \u03a9m0 = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b0 = 0.7, H0 = 100h km/s/Mpc,\nh = 0.7. We restrict the values of \u03b1 to the interval (\u22121, 1) [16, 17, 18, 19] and use \u03bb = 5 Mpc,\nsince this scale turns out to be an intermediate scale between the size of the clump groups and\nthe separation of the formed groups. However, we have analyzed elsewhere several values of\n\u03bb[8]. Other universe models have been analyzed in [6, 7, 9].\nBecause the visible component is the smaller one and given our interest to test the\nconsequences of including a SF contribution to the evolution equations, our model excludes\ngas particles, but all its mass has been added to the dark matter. In Fig. 1 we show the power\nspectrum at redshift z = 0 of our \u039bCDM model for several values of \u03b1. The line without symbols\nshows the case of a \u039bCDM model without the contribution of the scalar field. The line with\n(+) is the case of a \u039bCDM model with scalar field with \u03b1 = 1, the line with (\u2217) uses \u03b1 = \u22121/2,\nand the line with (o) uses \u03b1 = \u22121/4. One notes clearly how the SF modifies the clustering of\nmatter of the system. The most dramatic cases are the models with \u03b1 = \u22121/2 and \u03b1 = 1.\nWe now analyze the general effect the parameter \u03b1 has on the clustering. For a given \u03bb\nthe role of \u03b1 in our approach can be seen in equations (4)-(5) and is contained in the factor\nFSF (r, \u03b1, \u03bb). The factor FSF augments (diminishes) for positive (negative) values of \u03b1 for small\ndistances compared to \u03bb, resulting in more (less) structure formation for positive (negative)\nvalues of \u03b1 compared to the \u039bCDM model. In the case of the line with (+), for r \u226a \u03bb, the\neffective gravitational pull has been augmented by a factor of 2, in contrast to case shown with\nline and (\u2217) where it has diminished by a factor of 1/2; in the model with the line and (o) the\npull diminishes only by a factor of 3/4. That is why one observes for r < \u03bb more structure\nformation in case with line and (+), less in case with line and (\u2217), and lesser in model with line\nand (o). The effect is then, for a growing positive \u03b1, to speed up the growth of perturbations,\nthen of halos and then of clusters, whereas negative \u03b1 values (\u03b1 \u2192 \u22121) tend to slow down the\ngrowth.\n\n\f4. Conclusions\nThe general gravitational effect of the scalar-tensor dark matter model is that the interaction\nchanges by a factor FSF (r, \u03b1, \u03bb) \u2248 1 + \u03b1(1 + r/\u03bb) for r < \u03bb in comparison with the Newtonian\ncase. For negative values of \u03b1 the effect is to diminish the formation of structures and the\nopposite ocurrs for positive values of \u03b1. For r > \u03bb the dynamics is essentially Newtonian.\nBy computing the power spectrum we were able to determine the effects of the scalar field\ncontribution to the galaxy clustering. Of course we will need to do a systematic and with\ngreater resolution study and make detailed comparisons with observations to support or to rule\nout a dark model based on scalar-tensor theories.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by CONACYT, grant numbers CB-2007-84133-F, I0101/131/07 C234/07, IAC collaboration.
