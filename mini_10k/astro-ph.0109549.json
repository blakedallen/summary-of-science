Here we report\nmolybdenum isotope abundances determined in samples of various meteorite classes. There is no fractionation of molybdenum isotopes in our sample set within 0.1 h and no contribution from the extinct\nradionuclide 97 Tc at mass 97 (97 Tc/92 Mo < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 ). Instead, we observe clear anomalies in bulk iron\nmeteorites, mesosiderites, pallasites, and chondrites characterized by a coupled excess in p- and r- or a\nmirror deficit in s-process nuclides (Mo-HL). This large scale isotope heterogeneity of the solar system\nobserved for molybdenum must have been inherited from the interstellar environment where the sun was\nborn, illustrating the concept of \"cosmic chemical memory\". The presence of molybdenum anomalies is\nused to discuss the filiation between planetesimals.\nSubject headings: ISM: abundances-minor planets, asteroids-nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis,\nabundances-solar system: formation\nble anomalies could be used to trace the filiation between\nplanetesimals.\n\n1. introduction\n\nVariations of isotope abundances within the solar system\nthat depart from mass-dependent fractionation and nuclear effects may occur as a result of inheritance of presolar\nnucleosynthetic anomalies (Anders and Zinner 1993) and\nmass-independent isotope effects (Thiemens 1999). Such\nvariations have been detected in bulk meteorite samples\nfor a variety of elements including oxygen (Clayton 1993),\nsulfur (Thiemens and Jackson 1995; Farquhar et al. 2000),\ntitanium (Niemeyer 1988), chromium (Shukolyukov and\nLugmair 1998; Podosek et al. 1999), zirconium (Yin et al.\n2001), molybdenum (Yin et al. 2000), and barium (Harper\net al. 1992), although some of these observations need confirmation (Thiemens and Jackson 1995; Farquhar et al.\n2000; Yin et al. 2001, 2000; Harper et al. 1992). These\nvariations bear information on important subjects such as\nstellar nucleosynthesis, galactic chemical evolution, heterogeneity of the protosolar nebula, and filiation of planetary objects.\nMolybdenum is a promising element to use to address\nmost of these points. Indeed, unprocessed presolar carbide and graphite grains carry extreme molybdenum signatures inherited from the stellar environment where they\nformed (Nicolussi et al. 1998a,b; Pellin et al. 1999, 2000)\nand subtle nucleosynthetic anomalies have been detected\nin macroscopic meteorite samples (Yin et al. 2000). In addition, the p-process nuclide 97 Tc which decays by electron\ncapture to 97 Mo with a mean life of 3.8 Ma may have been\nalive in the early solar system (Yin and Jacobsen 1998),\nraising the possibility that this element can be used as an\nextinct chronometer (Podosek and Nichols 1996). Molybdenum is a highly refractory element (Fegley et al. 1993),\nso it has largely avoided exchange between gas and dust in\nthe forming solar system. Furthermore, it is a moderately\nsiderophile element (Schmitt et al. 1989) and therefore is\nrelatively abundant in all meteorite classes, so that possi1\n\n2. mo-hl isotope anomalies\n\nA protocol based on solvent extraction, ion exchange,\nand plasma ionization mass spectrometry was developed that permits the precise and accurate determination\nof molybdenum isotope abundances in natural samples\n(Dauphas et al. 2001). The method takes advantage of the\naffinity of molybdenum for di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate and\nAG1-X8 strongly basic anion exchanger in order to achieve\nfine separation of this element from interfering species\n(Dauphas et al. 2001; Qi-Lu and Masuda 1992a,b, 1994).\nIsotopic analyses were performed using a Micromass Isoprobe plasma ionization mass spectrometer. Molybdenum\nisotope abundances were corrected for zirconium (Nomura\net al. 1983) and ruthenium (Huang and Masuda 1997) isobaric interferences by monitoring the ion beam signal at\nmasses 91 and 99. As we were mostly interested in non\nmass-dependent variations, we employed an internal normalization procedure (98 Mo/96 Mo = 1.4470) in order to\ncorrect molybdenum isotope abundances for both natural and instrumental mass fractionation (Dauphas et al.\n2001) using the exponential law (Mar\u00e9chal et al. 1999). After internal normalization, no variation is observed among\nnatural terrestrial samples, which demonstrates the reliability of the method (Dauphas et al. 2001). Molybdenum and rhenium concentrations were determined by use\nof the standard addition technique. Molybdenum isotopic\ncomposition is expressed in \u01eb-units, which are relative deviations of the sample relative to terrestrial molybdenum\nisotopic composition in parts per 104 (\n),\n\u01ebi = [(i Mo/96 Mo)/(i Mo/96 Mo)std \u2212 1] \u00d7 104 ,\nwhere i = 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 100. We monitored\nthe raw ratios for mass fractionation by comparison with\nan external standard but found no variation in our sample\nset within \u223c 0.1 h/amu (Table 1).\n\n\u0098\n\n\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de G\u00e9ologie, rue du doyen Marcel Roubault, BP 40, 54501 Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy Cedex France\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDauphas et al.\n\nThe Allende CV3.2 chondrite is a Rosetta stone for deciphering early solar system evolution. We confirm (Fig. 1a)\nthe presence of molybdenum nucleosynthetic anomalies in\nmacroscopic samples of this meteorite (Yin et al. 2000; Yin\nand Jacobsen 2000). As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the anomalous isotopic composition observed in Allende may result\neither from a coupled enrichment in p- and r- or a mirror\ndeficit in s-nuclides (Anders and Grevesse 1989; Burbidge\net al. 1957; Cameron 1957). It has been suggested that the\nmolybdenum composition of Allende resulted from incomplete digestion of presolar grains that bear isotopic signatures typical of s-nucleosynthesis (Yin et al. 2000). Simple calculation (Becker et al. 1987; Huss and Lewis 1995;\nNicolussi et al. 1998a,b; Dauphas et al. 2001) indicates\nthat this cannot be the case because the resulting anomalies would be more than two orders of magnitude smaller\nthan those observed (Yin and Jacobsen 2000). This implies that anomalous molybdenum in bulk Allende must\nbe carried by another phase that needs to be identified,\npossibly metal, sulfide, or oxide presolar grains. In reference to Xe-HL (Anders and Zinner 1993; Reynolds and\nTurner 1964; Manuel et al. 1972), we denote the coupled\nanomalies in p- and r-nuclides Mo-HL.\nDifferentiation processes homogenize isotopic compositions originally existing within parent bodies. Thus, differentiated meteorites provide a means of examining isotopic\nheterogeneity in the protosolar nebula at scales comparable to the regions sampled by the parent bodies, which\nhad masses inferred from metallographic cooling rates to\nbe 1016 \u2212 1019 kg (Wood 1964; Goldstein and Ogilvie\n1965; Mittlefehldt et al. 1998). For this reason, we measured molybdenum isotope abundances in iron meteorites,\nmesosiderites, and pallasites (Fig. 1a, top right). Most\nmeteorite groups exhibit similar anomalies to those observed in Allende but of lesser magnitude. Because we\nobserve no decoupling within uncertainties between the\np- and r-anomalies, we cannot decide whether they result\nfrom the presence of p-, r- or the absence of s-presolar\nphases. In either case, the observed anomalies provide evidence for large scale inherited isotope heterogeneity of the\nprotosolar nebula.\nThe stellar environments where p-, r-, and snucleosynthesis develop are not identical (Burbidge et al.\n1957; Cameron 1957) and the host phases for these signatures are variable (Anders and Zinner 1993) so that the interstellar medium must be chemically and isotopically heterogeneous. Thus, molybdenum isotope abundances were\nheterogeneously distributed in the solar system parental\nmolecular cloud and the large scale variations we observe\nwere inherited from the interstellar environment where the\nsun was born, illustrating the concept of \"cosmic chemical\nmemory\" (Clayton 1982).\nIt was suggested that there might be a heterogeneous\ndistribution of short-lived nuclides 53 Mn and 182 Hf in the\nearly solar system (Lugmair and Shukolyukov 1998; Lee\nand Halliday 2000). Instead, the discovery of inherited isotope anomalies for molybdenum may support some form\nof \"cosmic chemical memory\" for stable isotopic ratios\n53\nCr/52 Cr and 182 W/184 W.\n\n3. live\n\n97\n\ntc in the early solar system?\n\nThe positive anomaly at mass 97 Mo could potentially\nrepresent a radiogenic contribution from the decay of 97 Tc\n(\u03c4 = 3.8 Ma) as well as a nucleosynthetic component.\nThe 187 Re \u2212187 Os system (\u03c4 = 62.8 Ga) offers tempting evidence for diachronism of iron meteorite formation\nbut the inferred chronologies are contradictory (Shen et\nal. 1996; Smoliar et al. 1996). The timescale inferred from\nthe 53 Mn \u221253 Cr system (\u03c4 = 5.4 Ma) is equivocal because\nthese nuclides may have been redistributed during the extended cooling history of planetesimals. Yet, some iron\nmeteorites have closure ages within \u223c 7 Ma of Allende refractory inclusions (Hutcheon et al. 1992). The time span\nbetween metal condensation in the protosolar nebula and\ncore crystallization in asteroids is best estimated from the\n107\nPd \u2212107 Ag system (\u03c4 = 9.4 Ma) to be lower than 10\nMa (Chen and Wasserburg 1996). Thus, iron meteorites\ncrystallized from a metallic magma within \u223c 10 Ma of\nthe solar system birth, when 97 Tc might have still been\nalive. Furthermore, the solid/liquid metal partition coefficient of rhenium (Fleet et al. 1999) and by inference\ntechnetium is higher than that of molybdenum (Liu and\nFleet 2001), thus the Re(Tc)/Mo ratio (Yin and Jacobsen 1998) should have been extensively fractionated during\nmetal crystallization (Table 1). The fractionation factor\nnotation (Jacobsen and Wasserburg 1984) is employed for\nthe Re(Tc)/Mo ratio,\nfRe/Mo = (185 Re/96 Mo)/(185 Re/96 Mo)std \u2212 1,\nwhere the standard ratio is that of the chondritic uniform reservoir (chur), 185 Re/96 Mo = 0.0454 (Anders and\nGrevesse 1989). To test whether a significant radiogenic\ncontribution exists on the 97 Mo peak, we use the fact that\nboth 97 Mo and 100 Mo are r-nuclides, so there must be\na relationship between the nucleosynthetic component at\nmass 97 and the anomaly at mass 100. Thus, we have corrected molybdenum isotope measurements for the nucleosynthetic contribution at mass 97 by using the observed\nanomaly at mass 100,\n\u01eb97\u2217 = \u01eb97 \u2212 (\u03c197 \u2212 0.5\u03c198 )/(1 \u2212 2\u03c198 ) \u00d7 \u01eb100 ,\nwhere \u03c1i = (i Mo/100 Mo)r /(i Mo/100 Mo)\u2295 , r and \u2295 denote\nthe r-process and the Earth, respectively. The term \u03c198\nenters into the equation because 98 Mo/96 Mo is used to\ncorrect measurements for mass fractionation (Dauphas et\nal. 2001). It is estimated that \u03c197 = 0.43 and \u03c198 = 0.25,\nso \u01eb97\u2217 = \u01eb97 \u2212 0.61 \u00d7 \u01eb100 (Arlandini et al. 1999). Rhenium is used as a proxy for technetium since these elements\nare likely to have very similar behavior during metal crystallization (Yin and Jacobsen 1998). If there were live\n97\nTc when the iron meteorites formed and if all iron meteorites crystallized simultaneously (Chen and Wasserburg\n1996), there should be a linear relationship (Jacobsen and\nWasserburg 1984) between the radiogenic contribution at\nmass 97 (\u01eb97\u2217 ) and the Re(Tc)/Mo fractionation factor\n(fRe/Mo ), the slope of which depends on the 97 Tc/185 Re\nratio at the time of closure,\n\u01eb97\u2217 = Q (97 Tc/185 Re)0 \u00d7 fRe/Mo ,\nwhere Q = 104 \u00d7 (185 Re/97 Mo)chur , Q \u223c 791 (Anders and\nGrevesse 1989). It follows from the definition of \u01eb97\u2217 that\nthis relationship holds only if the Earth evolved with a\nchondritic Tc/Mo while 97 Tc was still alive. This will be\ntrue if the core formed after the extinction of 97 Tc, which\nseems to be the case (All\u00e8gre et al. 1995; Galer and Goldstein 1996; Lee and Halliday 1995; Halliday et al. 1996).\n\n\fIsotope Heterogeneity of the Protosolar Nebula\nThere is no correlation between fRe/Mo and \u01eb97\u2217 which\nindicates that 97 Tc was extinct when the iron meteorites\nformed (97 Tc/92 Mo < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 , 92 Mo is used for normalization because both are p-nuclides and were synthetized\nin the same stellar environment). This result is consistent\nwith information retrieved from modelling of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy in the solar neighborhood (in\npreparation).\n4. inference on planetary genetics\n\nBecause there is no radiogenic contribution on 97 Mo and\nbecause \u01eb97 is measured much more precisely and accurately than other isotopic ratios, we used \u01eb97 to trace the\nfiliation between parent bodies (Fig. 2). Terrestrial rocks\n(stream sediments, porphyry copper millhead, and synthetic glass) are within 0.05\nof the terrestrial standard\nvalue (Dauphas et al. 2001), which demonstrates that the\nanalytical procedure is accurate. The molybdenum isotopic composition of the silicate Earth is representative of\nthe bulk Earth value because the mantle molybdenum content is largely dominated by the component derived from\nthe proto-Earth rather than from a late accreting veneer\n(Righter and Drake 1997). Within each meteorite class,\nmeasurements on various specimens are consistent with\nderivation from a common source, which reinforces the genetic significance of the chemical classification (Scott and\n\n\u0098\n\n3\n\nWasson 1975; Sears and Dodd 1988). On the basis of oxygen (Clayton 1993) and chromium (Shukolyukov and Lugmair 1998; Podosek et al. 1999; Shukolyukov and Lugmair\n2001) isotopic ratios, a genetic relationship between Eagle\nStation pallasites and some carbonaceous chondrites (ESPAL/CV) has been inferred. This link is corroborated by\nmolybdenum isotope measurements, which demonstrates\nthe virtue of this element for tracing the relationships\nbetween planetsimals. The isotopic data support the\nproposed genetic associations between type IIIAB iron\nmeteorites, mesosiderites, and main group pallasites (IIIAB/MES/MGPAL) but do not substantiate the link between types IAB and IIICD iron meteorites (IAB/IIICD)\n(Mittlefehldt et al. 1998).\nFurther analyses must be conducted on both macroscopic samples and separated phases in order to confirm\nand extend molybdenum isotope taxonomy and search for\nthe presolar carriers of Mo-HL.\nWe thank M.

Molybdenum isotope abundances in Allende [black (this study) and white\n(Yin et al. 2000) dots] depart from usual mass-dependent fractionation. Similar anomalies are observed in iron meteorites, mesosiderites, and\npallasites (top right) which provides evidence for large scale isotopic heterogeneity of the protosolar nebula. The top curves of the inset are\nthose of Allende. The isotopic spectrum we observe is denoted Mo-HL in reference to Xe-HL (Anders and Zinner 1993; Reynolds and Turner\n1964; Manuel et al. 1972). Uncertainties are 2\u03c3. b. Synthetic spectra obtained by adding or substracting pure p, r, and s nucleosynthetic\nabundances (Arlandini et al. 1999). The nucleosynthetic sources (Burbidge et al. 1957; Cameron 1957; Anders and Grevesse 1989) of the\ndifferent nuclides are indicated. There is a possible contribution at mass 97 from the decay of now extinct 97 Tc (\u03c4 = 3.8 Ma). The spectrum\nclosest to observations is that corresponding to a deficit in s- or a mirror excess in p- and r- nuclides.\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nDauphas et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Molybdenum isotope taxonomy.
