Consequently, in spite of the\nwell-known conclusion that single photon cannot be localized, there have been many\nattempts to introduce the concept of photon wave function and reconstruct a first and\nsecond quantization description of the photon [3-9], and a photon position operator with\ncommuting components has been constructed [10].\n\nIn fact, the conclusion of the\n\nnonlocalizability of the photon is disappointed from the perspective of quantum optics,\nand is hardly acceptable because it conflicts with our findings in laboratories [4]. For\nexample, the optical resolution problem cannot be understood unless the spatial photon\nlocalization problem is addressed. What is more, some recent studies have shown that\nphotons can be localized in space [11-13], where the Ref. [12] has shown that photons\ncan be localized in space with an exponential falloff of the energy density and photon\ndetection rate. Nowadays, a fresh interest in the photon localization problem has been\nawakened, meeting the needs of developments in near-field optics, cavity QED, and\nquantum computing.\nIn view of the mentioned above, the efforts of investigating the photon localization\nproblem are valuable. In this article, we firstly construct photon position operators in the\nlevels of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, which is discussed in our\nframework of photon wave mechanics, and then investigate the localization of photons\n\n2\n\n\finside a waveguide (a rectangular waveguide without loss of generality), which is mainly\nbased on the traditional framework of electromagnetic field theory.\nIn the following we apply the natural units of measurement ( = = c = 1 ) and the\nspace-time metric tensor is taken as g \u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) . Repeated indices must be\nsummed according to the Einstein rule. In this article we let x \u03bc = (t , \u2212 x ) , instead of\nx \u03bc = (t , x ) , denote the contravariant position 4-vector (and so on), then in our case\np\u02c6 \u03bc = i\n\n2\n\n\u2202\n\u2261 i\u2202 \u03bc = i(\u2202 t , \u2212\u2207 ) denote 4-momentum operators ( \u03bc ,\u03bd = 0,1, 2, 3 ), etc.\n\u2202x \u03bc\n\nGeneral points of view on the problem of position operator\nIn view of the fact that the quantum theory of the photon is directly a relativistic one,\n\nthe discussion of the photon localization problem requires the investigation of defining\nposition operators in relativistic quantum mechanics. The transition from nonrelativistic\nto relativistic quantum mechanics implies that the concepts of the nonrelativistic position\noperator have to be reinvestigated, this is because: 1) spatial and temporal coordinates\nhave to be treated equally within relativistic quantum mechanics; 2) a relativistic particle\ncannot be localized more accurately than its Compton wavelength, otherwise the particle\nautomatically has companions due to pair creation.\n\nThere not all operators of the\n\nnonrelativistic theory can be transferred to the relativistic one-particle theory, and thus in\nrelativistic quantum mechanics the consistency of the one-particle description is limited\n[15] .\nHowever, from nonrelativistic to relativistic theory there exists a unified point of\nview on localization problem. That is, even if expected from nonrelativistic quantum\nmechanics, the eigenfunctions of a position operator x\u0302 cannot be \u03b4 ( x \u2212 x \u2032) , which due\n\n3\n\n\fto the fact that when a spatial interval becomes smaller and smaller, nonrelativistic\nquantum mechanics being tenable only at low energies becomes no longer valid. In more\ndetail, as for a particle, the eigenfunctions of a position operator x\u0302 in position\nrepresentation are not \u03b4 ( x \u2212 x \u2032) , but a kind of smeared-out delta function which is\nsmeared out over a region of the order of the Compton wavelength of the particle. After\nall, the nonrelativistic theory is a low-energy approximation of the relativistic theory, and\nthen the physical rules obeyed by the nonrelativistic theory belong to a subset of the\nphysical rules obeyed by the relativistic theory. In a word, a position operator can be\ndefined only in the limit of having no pair creation and destruction, or in the limit of\nmeasurement distance greater than the Compton wavelength.\n\nCorrespondingly, one\n\nnever achieves exact localization in nature.\nA natural consider might be that, in the realm of relativistic quantum mechanics the\nconcept of localizability of physical systems should be connected to the space-time\nnotion, the one as a four-dimensional (4D) continuum. Correspondingly, one should\nview space-time as a whole and try to introduce a four-vector position operator, where\ntime coordinate is treated as an operator on an equal footing with 3D spatial position\noperators. However, such consider raises several questions. For example, According to\nPauli's argument [16], the existence of a self-adjoint time operator is incompatible with\nthe semi-bounded character of the Hamiltonian spectrum. A way out of these dilemmas\nis based on the use of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) [17]. In fact, up to\nnow, a variety of attempts have been made to resolve the position-operator problem\nwithin the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where\n\n4\n\n\fthe most important attempts are those via introducing a four-vector position operators\n[18-21] and using the formalism of POVMs [21-22, 14].\nHere our main purpose is to investigate the 3D spatial position operator and\nlocalization of the photon (as the massless particle).\n3\n\nPhoton position operator in quantum-mechanical level\nLet k \u03bc = (\u03c9 , \u2212k ) stand for the 4-momentum of a single Fourier mode of the photon\n\nfield ( = = c = 1 ), where \u03c9 = k 0 is also the angular frequency and k also the wave\nnumber vector. In Ref. [23], Maxwell's theory in vacuum medium is restated in a form\nclosely parallels to Dirac's theory of the electron, where the free photon field is described\nas a 6\u00d71 spinor \u03c8 ( x ) that transforms according to the (1, 0) \u2295 (0,1) representation of the\nLorentz group (the symbol \u2295 represents the direct sum), where the corresponding\nequation (say, the Dirac-like equation) has a Lorentz-covariant form. In such a way,\nphoton wave mechanics is reinvestigated in a more rigorous and unified way, where the\nDirac-like equation provide an unified and complete description for all kinds of\nelectromagnetic fields outside a source, including the time-varying and static fields, the\ntransverse and longitudinal fields, and those generated by an electrical or magnetic source,\netc. The 6\u00d71 spinor \u03c8 ( x ) can be written as, generally\n\n\u03c8 ( x) = \u2211\nk ,\u03bb\n\n\u03c9\n2V\n\n[a (k , \u03bb ) f ( k , \u03bb ) exp(\u2212ik \u22c5 x) + b + (k , \u03bb ) g (k , \u03bb ) exp(ik \u22c5 x)]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u00b11, 0 , the expansion coefficients a ( k , \u03bb ) and b + (k , \u03bb ) (the Hermitian\nconjugate of b( k , \u03bb ) ) are the annihilation and creation operators, and\nf (k , \u03bb ) =\n\n\u239b \u03b5 (k , \u03bb ) \u239e\n1 \u239b \u03bb\u03b5 (k , \u03bb ) \u239e\n, g (k , \u03bb ) =\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239c\n\u239f\n1 + \u03bb 2 \u239d \u03b5 (k , \u03bb ) \u23a0\n1 + \u03bb 2 \u239d \u03bb\u03b5 (k , \u03bb ) \u23a0\n1\n\n(2)\n\n5\n\n\fwhere three unit polarization vectors \u03b5 ( k , \u03bb ) (in the form of 3\u00d71 column matrices,\n\n\u03bb = \u00b11, 0 ) satisfy the orthonormal and completeness relations\n\u23a7\u03b5 + (k , \u03bb )\u03b5 (k , \u03bb \u2032) = \u03b4 \u03bb\u03bb \u2032\n\u23aa\n\u23a8 \u03b5 (k , \u03bb )\u03b5 + (k , \u03bb ) = I\n3\u00d73\n\u23aa\u23a9\u2211\n\u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nAccording to Ref.

In fact, one can regard\nx\u0302 as the photon position operator with commuting components, which is the same as that\ngiven in Ref. [10]. However, it is worth stressing that:\n1) As compared with Ref. [10], the result obtained here is more natural (because the\n\n\u03bb = 0 solutions are not discarded in our case), while in Ref. [10], the reason that the\nthree-vector wave functions in momentum-space also contain the longitudinal\ncomponent seems to be insufficient.\n2) As compared with Ref. [14], here the presence of longitudinal field components does\nnot cause any trouble, while in Ref. [14], in order to obtain a photon position operator\nwith commuting components, the author has constructed an enlarged Hilbert space\nthat also contains the longitudinal field components.\n4\n\nPhoton position operator in the level of quantum field theory\n\n7\n\n\fIn processes that do not involve particle-pair creation or annihilation, a position\noperator can be defined within the second-quantization formalism. In the present case,\nthe photon position operator can be defined as, in the level of quantum field theory\nX = \u222b [( \u2212i\u2202 t ) \u22121\u03c8 + ( x )] x\u03c8 ( x)d 3 x\n\n(10)\n\nIn the following we shall make no distinction between the photons come from electric\nmultipole moments and those from magnetic multipole moments, and thus let\nb(k , \u03bb ) = a ( k , \u03bb ) in the final results. Applying Eq.

It\nis interesting to note that Eq. (12) can be also interpreted as the position-quantization of\nthe electromagnetic field, which is due to the fact that the electromagnetic field consists\nof photons. In fact, starting from Dirac electron theory, in a similar way one can obtain\nthe counterpart of Eq. (12).\nIf a ( k , \u03bb ) and b( k , \u03bb ) are independent of k , consider that\n\n\u2211\u03bb\nk,\n\n\u03c9 b + (k , \u03bb ) g (k , \u03bb )ei(\u03c9t \u2212 k \u22c5 x ) = \u2211 \u03c9 b + (k0 , \u2212k , \u03bb ) g (k0 , \u2212 k , \u03bb )ei(\u03c9t + k \u22c5 x )\nk ,\u03bb\n\n= X\u02c6 + \u03c9 f (k , \u03bb )e \u2212i(\u03c9t \u2212 k \u22c5 x )\n\u03c9 g (k0 , \u2212k , \u03bb ) xei(\u03c9t + k \u22c5 x ) = X\u02c6 \u2212 \u03c9 f (k0 , \u2212k , \u03bb )ei(\u03c9t + k \u22c5 x )\n\n\u03c9 f (k , \u03bb ) xe\n\n\u2212 i(\u03c9t \u2212 k \u22c5 x )\n\n(13)\n\n8\n\n\fwhere\nk\nX\u02c6 + = i(\u2207 k \u2212 2 ) I 6\u00d76 \u2212 i\u2211 [\u2207 k f (k , \u03bb )] f + (k , \u03bb )\n2\u03c9\n\u03bb\nk\nX\u02c6 \u2212 = i(\u2207 k \u2212 2 ) I 6\u00d76 \u2212 i\u2211 [\u2207 k g (k0 , \u2212 k , \u03bb )]g + (k0 , \u2212 k , \u03bb )\n2\u03c9\n\u03bb\n\n(14)\n\nIn the present case, Eq.

In our case, the momentum-space scalar product is defined by\nEq. (5), while Eq. (15) represents the momentum-space average of the photon position\noperator.\nTherefore, in the level of quantum field theory, the photon position operator X is\ndirectly related to the naive position operator i\u2207 k via Eq. (12) and can be interpreted as a\ncenter of the photon number. If the numbers of the photons with different momentums\nare the same, the photon position operator (see Eqs. (14)-(15)) corresponds to the\nmomentum-space average of the operators that similar to the Hawton's position operator\npresented in Ref. [10].\n5\n\nLocalization of photons inside a waveguide\n\nPeople have shown that a single photon cannot be localized in the same sense that a\nmassive particle in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can be localized [24]. However,\n\n9\n\n\fnot only the massless particle such as the photon, but also the massive particle itself,\ncannot be localized in the traditional sense that a massive particle in nonrelativistic\nquantum mechanics can be localized. This is due to the fact that, when a particle is\nconfined to a small region, nonrelativistic quantum mechanics may become no longer\nvalid. Therefore, the concept of localizability in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is\njust an ideal one. On the other hand, in the level of relativistic quantum mechanics, there\nhas a common property for the localizability of all massive particles: it is impossible to\nlocalize a particle with a greater precision than its Compton wavelength, which owing to\nmany-particle phenomena.\n\nTherefore, though there has no nonrelativistic quantum\n\nmechanics of the photon, it presents no problem; one can study the localizability of the\nphoton only in the sense that a massive particle in relativistic quantum mechanics can be\nlocalized.\nIn practice, an interaction is necessary to locate a particle. On the other hand, in all\nthe electromagnetism techniques, an interaction between photons and the related\napparatuses is inevitable. These interactions include that of confining photons to a spatial\nregion, where the dimension of the region can be 1, 2, or 3. As an example, we shall\nshow that the photons inside a waveguide can be localized in the same sense that a\nmassive particle can be localized in free space.\nIn a Cartesian coordinate system spanned by an orthonormal basis {e1 , e2 , e3 } with\ne3 = e1 \u00d7 e2 , we assume that a hollow metallic waveguide is placed along the direction of\ne3 , and the waveguide is a straight rectangular pipe with the transversal dimensions being\nb1 and b2 , respectively, and let b1 > b2 without loss of generality. The conductivity of the\nmetal pipe is assumed to be infinite. It is also assumed that the waveguide is infinitely\n\n10\n\n\flong and the source of the electromagnetic field is localized at infinity. The pipe is\nconsidered as a boundary which confines the waves to the enclosed space.\nWhen the electromagnetic waves propagate along the direction of the waveguide,\nthey are reflected back and forth by perfectly conducting walls in the empty inner space\nof the pipe. For simplicity, we assume that the photons inside the waveguide correspond\nto a given eigenmode of the waveguide, and have 4-momentum k \u03bc = (\u03c9 , k ) in the\nCartesian coordinate system {e1 , e2 , e3 } , where the wave-number vector is\n3\n\nk = \u2211 ei ki = (k1 , k2 , k3 ) and the frequency \u03c9 = k = k12 + k22 + k32 .\n\nConsider that the\n\ni =1\n\nwaveguide is placed along the direction of e3 , the allowed values for the wave numbers\nk1 and k2 are fixed by b1 and b2 , respectively, that is, k1 = r\u03c0 / b1 and k2 = s\u03c0 / b2 , where\nr = 1, 2,3... , s = 0,1, 2... . Then the cutoff frequency of the waveguide is \u03c9c = k12 + k22\n\n( = = c = 1 ), which is determined by the transversal dimensions of the waveguide.\nWe define the apparent mass of photons inside the waveguide as\n\nm = =\u03c9c / c 2 = \u03c9c = k12 + k22\n\n(17)\n\nThen the photon energy E = \u03c9 satisfies\nE 2 = k32 + m 2\n\n(18)\n\nNow we choose another Cartesian coordinate system formed by an orthonormal basis\n{a1 , a2 , a3 } with a3 = a1 \u00d7 a2 , such that in the new coordinate system, one has\n3\n\ne3 k3 = \u2211 ai pi = p\n\n(19)\n\ni =1\n\n11\n\n\fIn the following we let k3 \u2265 0 without loss of generality. If k3 = p > 0 , in the coordinate\nsystem {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the unit vectors ei ( i = 1, 2, 3 ) can be expressed as\n\u23a7\np12 p3 + p22 p p1 p2 p3 \u2212 p1 p2 p\np\n,\n,\u2212 1 )\n\u23aae1 = e ( p,1) = (\n2\n2\n2\n2\np\np ( p1 + p2 )\np ( p1 + p2 )\n\u23aa\n\u23aa\np1 p2 p3 \u2212 p1 p2 p p22 p3 + p12 p\np\n\u23aa\n(\n,\n2)\n(\n,\n,\u2212 2 )\ne\n=\ne\np\n=\n\u23a8 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\np\np ( p1 + p2 )\np ( p1 + p2 )\n\u23aa\n\u23aa\n1\np\n= ( p1 , p2 , p3 )\n\u23aae3 = e ( p,3) = e ( p,1) \u00d7 e ( p, 2) =\np\np\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\n(20)\n\nObviously, as p3 \u2192 p = k3 such that p \u2192 (0, 0, p3 ) , one has (ei ) j = \u03b4 ij , i.e., the\ncoordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } coincides with {e1 , e2 , e3 } by ai = ei ( i, j = 1, 2, 3 ). Note\nthat, in the Cartesian coordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the frequency \u03c9 is invariant (i.e., in\na 3D spatial rotation that results in a transformation {e1 , e2 , e3 } \u2192 {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the time\ncomponent \u03c9 of the 4-momentum k \u03bc = (\u03c9 , k ) would keep invariant). What is more, in\nthe coordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the momentum 3-vector of the photons inside the\nwaveguide can be written as\nk = kT + kL\n\n(21)\n\nwhere\n3\n\nkT \u2261 e ( p,1)k1 + e ( p, 2)k2 , kL = p = \u2211 ai pi\n\n(22)\n\ni =1\n\nstand for the transverse and longitudinal components of k , respectively.\n\nIn the\n\ncoordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } , Eq. (18) can be expressed as the form of the usual\nrelativistic energy-momentum relation (or, the relativistic dispersion relation):\nE 2 = p2 + m2\n\n(23)\n\n12\n\n\fthis is closely analogous to that of a material (massive) particle.\n\nThen, the cutoff\n\nfrequency \u03c9c , as the vertical-motion energy of the photons inside the waveguide, plays\nthe role of rest mass. Moreover, in the coordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the 3D vector\n3\n\np = \u2211 ai pi represents the momentum of the photons along the direction of the\ni =1\n\nwaveguide, while the 3D vector kT is perpendicular to p and then represents transverse\nmomentum, it contributes the apparent mass m to the photons in such a way:\n\nm = \u03c9c = kT\n\n(17)'\n\nThat is, the constraint on the motion of the photons in the transverse direction of the\nwaveguide gives rise to an equivalent mass to the photons.\nFurthermore, the group velocity (denoted by vg ) and phase velocity (denoted by vp )\nof the photons inside the waveguide are, respectively ( = = c = 1 )\nvg = e ( p,3) 1 \u2212 (\u03c9c / \u03c9 ) 2 = e ( p,3)\n\np\nE\n\n=\n\np\nE\n\ne ( p,3)\n\nE\nvp =\n= e ( p,3)\np\n1 \u2212 (\u03c9c / \u03c9 ) 2\n\n(24)\n\nFurther, one can obtain the de Broglie's relations ( vg = vg , vp = vp )\nvg vp = c 2 = 1\nE 2 = p2 c 2 + m2 c 4 = p2 + m2\nE = =\u03c9 = \u03c9\np = =kg = kg\n\n(25)\n\nwhere kg = e ( p, 3) 2\u03c0 \u03bbg is the guide-wavenumber vector, \u03bbg is the actual guide\nwavelength inside the waveguide, which is defined as the distance between two equal\nphase planes along the waveguide and plays the role of the de Broglie's wavelength. In\n\n13\n\n\fterms of the free-space wavelength \u03bb = 2\u03c0 k , one has \u03bbg = \u03bb / 1 \u2212 (\u03c9c / \u03c9 )2 . Form Eqs.\n(24)-(25) one can also obtain the relativistic energy\n\nE=\n\nmc 2\n1 \u2212 (vg2 / c 2 )\n\n=\n\nm\n1 \u2212 vg2\n\n(26)\n\nIn fact, inside the waveguide, the group velocity vg of the photons can be viewed as a\nrelative velocity between an observer and the photons with the apparent mass m = \u03c9c .\nFrom Eqs. (23)-(26), one can show that there exists a closely analogy between the\nbehaviors of the de Broglie matter waves and those of the electromagnetic waves inside a\nwaveguide. In fact, the similarity between the dispersion relation of matter waves for\nmaterial (massive) particles and that of electromagnetic waves inside the waveguide has\nbeen mentioned before [25-26].\nTo discuss these rigorously and generally, we are suggested by the concept of the\napparent mass and Eq. (23), and define the apparent 4-momentum of the photons inside\nthe waveguide as kL\u03bc \u2261 ( E , p) . Furthermore, consider that the apparent mass is always\npositive, that is, m = kT = (r\u03c0 b1 ) 2 + ( s\u03c0 b2 )2 > 0 , one can define a space-like 4-vector\n\n\u03b7\u03bc \u2261 (0, kT / kT ) that obviously satisfies \u03b7\u03bc\u03b7 \u03bc = \u22121 . By \u03b7 \u03bc we introduce a space-like 4momentum kT\u03bc \u2261 (0, kT ) = m\u03b7 \u03bc , which describes the motion along the direction\nperpendicular to the apparent four-momentum kL\u03bc .\n\nIn such a way, we obtain an\n\northogonal decomposition for the 4-momentum of the photons inside the waveguide,\nnamely, one has\n\n14\n\n\fk\u03bc = (\u03c9 , k ) = kT\u03bc + kL\u03bc\nkT\u03bc \u2261 (0, kT ) = m\u03b7 \u03bc , kL\u03bc \u2261 ( E , p)\n\n(27)\n\nkL\u03bc kT\u03bc = 0, \u03b7 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03bc = \u22121\nwhere note that the orthogonal relation kL\u03bc kT\u03bc = 0 is Lorentz invariant. In fact, all lightlike 4-vectors can be orthogonally decomposed as the sum of a space-like 4-vector and a\ntime-like 4-vector. As for the photons inside the waveguide, the time-like 4-momentum\nkL\u03bc representing their apparent 4-momentum, can be called the active part of k \u03bc , or the\n\nkinematics part of k \u03bc ; while the space-like 4-momentum kT\u03bc contributing the apparent\nmass term, can be called the frozen part of k \u03bc , or the stationary-wave part of k \u03bc . In a\nword, the constraint on the motion of the photons in the transverse direction of the\nwaveguide gives rise to an apparent mass to the photons, or equivalently, the apparent\nmass term arises by freezing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the transverse\n4-momentum kT\u03bc .\nNow, from the point of view of 4D space-time, we shall give a description of the\nelectromagnetic waveguide theory in a Lorentz covariant formulation. As discussed\nbefore, in the Cartesian coordinate system {a1 , a2 , a3 } , the waveguide is placed along the\n3\n\ndirection of the vector p = \u2211 ai pi .\n\nConsider that the divergence of electric field\n\ni =1\n\nintensities must be zero in the free space inside the waveguide (since there are no charges\nthere), in spite of the boundary conditions for the waveguide, the photons in the free\nspace inside the waveguide should obey the Maxwell equations, or, the Dirac-like\nequation [23]\n\ni\u03b2 \u03bc \u2202 \u2032\u03bc\u03c8 \u2032( x) = 0\n\n(28)\n\n15\n\n\fAccording to Ref. [23], in terms of \u03c4 = (\u03c4 1 ,\u03c4 2 ,\u03c4 3 ) , where (\u03c4 l )mn = \u2212i\u03b5 lmn ( \u03b5 lmn denote the\nfull antisymmetric tensor with \u03b5123 = 1 ), the matrices \u03b2 \u03bc = ( \u03b2 0 , \u2212 \u03b2 ) can be written as\n\n\u239bI\n\n0 \u239e\n\n\u239b 0\n\n\u03c4\u239e\n\n\u03b2 0 = \u239c 3\u00d73\n\u239f , \u03b2 = ( \u03b21 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b23 ) = \u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d \u2212\u03c4 0 \u23a0\n\u239d 0 \u2212 I 3\u00d73 \u23a0\n\n(29)\n\nCorresponding to Eq. (27), i.e., the orthogonal decomposition of the 4-momentum of the\nphotons inside the waveguide, one can make an orthogonal decomposition for the 4momentum operator i\u2202\u2032\u03bc presented in Eq. (28)\ni\u2202\u2032\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc + m\u03b7 \u03bc = i(\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 im\u03b7 \u03bc )\n\n(30)\n\nsuch that Eq. (28) becomes as\n\ni\u03b2 \u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 im\u03b7\u03bc )\u03c8 ( x) = 0\n\n(31)\n\nFor simplicity, let \u03c8 \u2032( x) = \u03c6 (k ) exp(\u2212ik\u03bc x \u03bc ) and hence \u03c8 \u2032( x) = \u03c8 ( x) exp(\u2212ikT\u03bc x \u03bc ) , i.e.,\n\n\u03c8 ( x) = \u03c6 (k ) exp(\u2212ikL\u03bc x \u03bc ) . In the present case, one has\ni\u2202\u2032\u03bc\u03c8 \u2032( x) = k\u03bc\u03c8 \u2032( x)\ni\u2202 \u03bc\u03c8 ( x) = kL\u03bc\u03c8 ( x)\n\n(32)\n\n\u03b7 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bc\u03c8 ( x) = \u2202 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03bc\u03c8 ( x) = 0\nCorrespondingly, by replacing \u2207\u2032 with (\u2207 \u2212 im\u03b7) one can obtain a new expression of the\noriginal transversality conditions. Using Eqs. (27), (31) and (32), and denote p\u02c6 \u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc ,\none can obtain\n\n( p\u02c6 \u03bc p\u02c6 \u03bc \u2212 m2 )\u03c8 ( x) = 0\n\n(33)\n\nor, in the momentum space\n\n(kL\u03bc kL\u03bc \u2212 m2 )\u03c6 (k ) = ( E 2 \u2212 p 2 \u2212 m2 )\u03c6 (k ) = 0\n\n(34)\n\nwhich is agreement with Eq. (23). In fact, using Eq. (27), one can directly obtain\n\n16\n\n\fkL\u03bc kL\u03bc \u2212 m2 = kL\u03bc kL\u03bc + kT\u03bc kT\u03bc = k\u03bc k \u03bc = 0 (35)\nIn a word, the photons in the free space inside the waveguide satisfy the new Diraclike equation (31) and the Klein-Gordon equation (33), where the cutoff frequency\nm = \u03c9c plays the role of rest mass. Therefore, inside the waveguide, the electromagnetic\nwaves for photons become a concept analogous to that of the matter waves for material\n(massive) particles, which can be shown further by Eqs. (23)-(26). This implies that the\nphotons inside the waveguide may be localized in the usual sense that a massive particle\ncan be localized in free space.\nIn fact, there has another way of looking at the discussions above. In detail, we shall\nshow that, what we discuss above provides a realistic model for the theory given by Ref.\n[20]. In Ref. [20] the authors have introduced quantum observables describing the spacetime position of the physical event defined by the intersection of two light pulses, where\nthe conformal-transformation generators (related to conformal symmetry of massless\nquantum fields) is used first to build the definition of there space-time observables, by\nwhich the connection between the definition of an observable space-time position and the\nmassive character of the state has been obtained a simple physical interpretation.\nAs we known, on the one hand, the TEM mode (both the electric and magnetic\nfields perpendicular to the direction of propagation) cannot propagate in a single\nconductor transmission line, only those modes in the form of transverse electric (TE) and\ntransverse magnetic (TM) modes can propagate in the waveguide. On the other hand,\nhowever, there has another useful way of looking at the propagation [26-27], that is, the\nwaveguide field can be viewed as the superposition of two sets of plane waves (i.e., the\nTEM waves) being continually reflected back and forth between perfectly conducting\n\n17\n\n\fwalls and zigzagging down the waveguide (see Figure 1). The two sets of plane waves\nhave the same amplitudes and frequencies, but reverse phases. Namely, for a given wall\nof the waveguide, if one set of plane waves correspond to the incident waves, then\nanother to the reflected wave (a reflection means reversal of phase). Let k1\u03bc and k2 \u03bc\ndenote the 4-momemnta of the two sets of plane waves, respectively, one has, obviously\nk1\u03bc k1\u03bc = k2 \u03bc k2\u03bc = 0\n(k1\u03bc + k2 \u03bc )(k1\u03bc + k2\u03bc ) = 4( E 2 \u2212 p 2 ) = 4m2\n\n(36)\n\nWhere the factor of 4 presents no problem, because once the waveguide field is expressed\nas the superposition of two sets of plane waves, its amplitude is halved. Equation (36)\nimplies that, with the aid of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra one can construct the position operator\nof the photons inside the waveguide, in the same sense that the position operator of a\nmassive particle can be constructed.\n\nThe detailed discussions are similar to those\n\npresented in Ref. [20]. However, in contrast with Ref. [20], here one can show that, not\nonly the presence of the two photons propagating in different directions, but also the\nsuperposition of two different wave-vector states of a single photon, allow one to\nintroduce the definition of a localized event. The second case is due to the presence of\nthe apparent mass of the photons inside the waveguide.\nAs mentioned before, there has a common property for the localizability of all\nmassive particles: it is impossible to localize a particle with a greater precision than its\nCompton wavelength, which owing to many-particle phenomena. Likewise, in terms of\nthe concept of the apparent mass m = \u03c9c , one can define the equivalent Compton\nwavelength of the photons inside the waveguide\n\n18\n\n\f\u03bbcom =\n\n=\n\n\u03c9c c\n\n=\n\n1\n=\n=\nmc m\n\n(37)\n\nSimilarly, as for the localizability of the photons inside the waveguide, one can arrival at\nsuch a conclusion: it is impossible to localize a photon inside a waveguide with a greater\nprecision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, which owing to evanescent-wave or\nphoton-tunneling phenomena. For example, assume that a photon inside a waveguide lies\nin a given mode of the waveguide, if one tries to reduce the size of the cross section of\nthe waveguide and obtain a new waveguide, so as to localize the photon within the cross\nsection with a greater precision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, then there\nalways exists an inertial reference frame in which the photon's frequency is smaller than\nthe cutoff frequency of the new waveguide, this shows that the photon-tunneling\nphenomenon would take place. In fact, here we have given another way of looking at the\nrelation between optical tunneling and photon localizability, which has been discussed in\nRef. [28]\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the level of quantum mechanics, a photon position operator with commuting\ncomponents can be obtained in a more natural way as compared with Refs. [10] and [14];\nin the level of quantum field theory, we find that the photon position operator (given by\nEq. (12)) corresponds to the average of the naive position operator with respect to the\nparticle numbers and can be interpreted as a center of the photon number. It is interesting\nto note that Eq. (12) can be also interpreted as the position-quantization of the\nelectromagnetic field, which is due to the fact that the electromagnetic field consists of\nphotons. In fact, starting from Dirac electron theory, in a similar way one can obtain the\ncounterpart of Eq. (12). It is most interesting for us to show that, a photon inside a\n\n19\n\n\fwaveguide can be localized in the same sense that a massive particle can be localized in\nfree space, this actually provides a realistic model for the theory given by Ref. [20]. Just\nas that it is impossible to localize a massive particle with a greater precision than its\nCompton wavelength (due to many-particle phenomenon), one can also arrival at a\nsimilar conclusion: it is impossible to localize a photon inside a waveguide with a greater\nprecision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, which owing to evanescent-wave or\nphoton-tunneling phenomena.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe first author (Z.
