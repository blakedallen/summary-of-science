INTRODUCTION\n\nThe current observation data support the standard\n\u039bCDM model [1]. Recently, however, there is an growing interest in analyzing possible large-scale anomalies\nof CMB, from both theoretical and observational sides\n[2],[3],[4],[6],[5],[7],[8],[11],[12][14].\nIt appears that the lowest CMB multipoles are anomalous in two seemingly distinct aspects. Firstly, the angular power Cl at the lowest l is abnormally suppressed [3].\nSecondly, they have an improbable directionality revealed\nby the fact that for a certain preferred orientation, one mmode absorbs most of the power, which may imply the\npresence of an \"axis of evil\" [4, 5].\nThe statistical properties of perturbations carry the same\nsymmetries as the background on which they are generated. In the standard scenario, quantum fluctuations\nare assumed to be generated on a spatially homogeneous\nand isotropic background. Background spatial inhomogeneities are neglected in most of the analysis. Indeed,\na long period of inflation pulls all non-smooth classical\ninitial conditions out of the horizon. However, if inflation lasts the minimal number 60 e-folds or so, perturbations with comoving wave-numbers of cosmological interest cross the horizon just during the earliest several e-folds\nof inflation. Thus, the relic inhomogeneities may leave\nsome marks in the primordial quantum fluctuations.\nIn this Letter, we investigate the possible effects of a\nrelic classical superhorizon inhomogeneity during inflation, especially its effects on the statistical properties of\nquantum fluctuations. In [6, 7], a single superhorizon\nperturbation mode were considered to explain the power\nasymmetry of CMB on large scales. While in this work,\nwe consider relic superhorizon inhomogeneities as background. Perturbation theory in the presence of a spatially\ninhomogeneous inflaton background value has been investigated by several authors before [11],[12]. Quantum fluctuations on this slightly inhomogeneous background are\ngenerally statistical anisotropic.\nThe deviations from statistical isotropy can take on\nmany forms, which may correspond to different physical\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gaoxian@itp.ac.cn\n\norigins.\ni was presented in [4],P (k) =\nh One simple form\n2\nP (k) 1 + g(k)(k\u0302 * n) . In this work, we find that\nthe (leading-order) correction to the statistically isotropic\npower spectrum is of the ACW form [4], but with a kdependent factor g(k) \u223c \u22121/k 2. Thus, the power spectrum deviates from isotropy mainly on large scales (small\nk), while remains highly isotropic on small scales. Moreover, the spectrum itself is also suppressed on large scales.\nThus, our model can simultaneously explain the observed\nanisotropic alignments of the low-l multipoles and their\nlow power.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND BACKGROUND\n\nIn this work we investigate general single scalar field\ninflationary\nmodels, with an action of the form S =\nR 4 \u221a\nd x \u2212g [R/2 + P (X, \u03c6)], where X = \u2212 21 (\u2202\u03c6)2 .\nNow we consider a slightly inhomogeneous inflaton background \u03c6\u0304(t, x). Firstly, we assume the deviation from homogeneity is very small, i.e., if \u03c6\u0304(t) is a spatial average of\n\u03c6\u0304(t, x) (e.g. in one Hubble volume), then we assume that\n\u03c6\u0304(t, x) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(t)\n\u226a 1.\n\u03c6\u0304(t)\n\n(2.1)\n\nSecondly, we assume the inhomogeneities are superhorizon. In other words, the typical comoving scale of these\nbackground inhomogeneities l is much larger than today's\ncomoving Hubble scale, l \u226b (a0 H0 )\u22121 . Actually, it has\nbeen known long before that inflation can occur in the presence of superhorizon initial inhomogeneities [9]. In other\nwords, the inflaton field initially should be smooth up to\nphysical scales larger than \u223c H \u22121 . Thus, today's observational universe can indeed inflate from an initial small\npatch with classical inhomogeneities with typical comoving scale l \u226b (a0 H0 )\u22121 .\nSuperhorizon inhomogeneities locally look like a gradient, \u03c6\u0304(t, x) = \u03c6\u0304(t, x0 ) + (x \u2212 x0 ) * \u2207\u03c6\u0304(t, x0 ) + * * * . In\nthis work, we neglect higher-order derivatives and treat \u2207\u03c6\u0304\nas approximately constant (while \u03c6\u0304 itself is indeed slowrolling, for instance).\n\n\f2\nIII.\n\nLINEAR PERTURBATIONS\n\nWe split \u03c6(t, x) into background and fluctuation configurations,\n\nNow we take the scale factor as a(\u03b7) = \u22121/H\u03b7. Remarkably, in this simplest case, Eq. (3.5) has an analytic\nsolution,\n\u0393(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bd) i\u03c0 (\u03bd+ 1 ) i \u03bb\u03b72 \u221a\n2 e2\n\u221a e2\n\u2212\u03b7(\u2212ck\u03b7)\u03bd U (\u03b1, \u03bd+1, z) ,\n2\u03bd+1 \u03c0\n(3.6)\nin which U (\u03b1, \u03bd + 1, z) is the confluent hypergeometric\nfunction, with\nr\nM\n9\n\u03bd=\n,\n\u2212\n4 H2\n\u221a\n1\nic2 k 2 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b3(A * k)\np\n,\n\u03b1 = (\u03bd + 1) \u2212\n(3.7)\n2\n4|A * k| \u03b3 + \u01eb\u03b3 2\np\nz = \u2212i|A * k| \u03b3 + \u01eb\u03b3 2 \u03b7 2 ,\np\n\u221a\n\u03bb = |A * k| \u03b3 + \u01eb\u03b3 2 + \u01eb\u03b3(A * k) .\nuk (\u03b7) =\n\n\u03c6(t, x) = \u03c6\u0304(t, x) + \u03b4\u03c6(t, x) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn the following we denote \u2202i \u03c6\u0304(t, x) = Ai , which we have\nassumed to be constant.\nAs a first-step investigation, we neglect the metric perturbations. Thus the calculation is straight forward since\nall we have to do is to expand the action for the scalar field\ndirectly. According to (3.1), simple Taylor expansion of\nP (X, \u03c6) around the background \u03c6\u0304 up to second order of \u03b4\u03c6\ngives \u2212 21 \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03b4\u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03b4\u03c6\u2212P,X\u03c6 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u2202\u03bc \u03b4\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6+ 21 P,\u03c6\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c62 ,\nwhere we have defined\n\u03a3\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 P,X g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 P,XX \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u2202 \u03bd \u03c6\u0304 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nNote that due to the non-vanishing background gradient\n\u2202i \u03c6\u0304, \u03a3ij is not proportional \u03b4ij any more. The presence\nof the additional term which is proportional \u2202i \u03c6\u0304\u2202j \u03c6\u0304 in \u03a3ij\nbreaks spatial rotational invariance and will be responsible\nfor the generation of statistical anisotropies of the scalar\nperturbations \u03b4\u03c6.\n=\n\u221aAfter introducing a new variable u(\u03b7, x)\na \u2212\u03a300 \u03b4\u03c6, the second-order action for the scalar\nfield perturbations can be written as\n\u0014\n\u221a\nd3 k 1 \u2032\n2i \u01eb\u03b3\n\u2032\nd\u03b7\nu\nu\n+\n(A * k)u\u2032\u2212k uk\n(2\u03c0)3 2 \u2212k k\naH\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\u2032\u2032\n\u03b3(A * k)2\n\u2212 c2 k 2 \u2212\nu\nu\n+M+\n\u2212k k ,\na\na2 H 2\n(3.3)\nwhere \u03b7 is comoving time, and a prime represents \u2202/\u2202\u03b7,\nH \u2261 a\u2032 /a, and M is an effective mass term, \u01eb is defined as\n\u01eb = \u03c6\u03072 /H 2 .

Note that the canonical\ncase corresponds to c2 = 1 and \u03b3 = 0. In deriving (3.3),\nwe use the approximation that \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd is a function of only \u03b7,\nthat is, we neglect the spatial dependence of \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nA.\n\nEquation of Motion for the Perturbations and Solutions\n\nThe classical equation of motion for the mode function\naccording to the second-order action (3.3) is\n\u221a\n2i \u01eb\u03b3(A * k) \u2032\nuk\n\u0013\n\u0012 aH\n\u03b3(A * k)2\na\u2032\u2032\n2\n2 2\nuk = 0 .\n+ Ma +\n+ c k \u2212\na\na2 H 2\n(3.5)\nAs it can be seen, an anisotropic dispersion relation arises,\nwhich will be responsible for the generation of a statistically anisotropic power spectrum.\nu\u2032\u2032k +\n\nDue to the presence of the factor A * k, the modes generally depend on k rather than k = |k|.

Thus our mode solution (3.6)\ngeneralizes the standard homogeneous and isotropic background to the case of the presence of superhorizon background inhomogeneities.\nB. Anisotropic Power Spectrum\n\nWhen all modes of cosmological interest exit the Hubble scale, that is, in \u03b7 \u2192 0 limit, since U (\u03b1, \u03b2, z) \u2192\n\u0393(\u03b2\u22121) 1\u2212\u03b2\nas z \u2192 0 (when \u03b2 > 2), we get\n\u0393(\u03b1) z\n1\n\u0393(\u03bd)\n1\n\u2212\u03bd\n\u221a\n(\u2212ck\u03b7) 2\n,\n\u0393(3/2) 2ck\n(3.8)\nwhere we have defined an anisotropic deformation factor,\n\nuk (\u03b7) = A(k) e\n\n1\ni\u03c0\n2 (\u03bd\u2212 2 )\n\n\u0393(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bd)\nA(k) \u2261\n\u0393(\u03b1)\n\n3\n\n2\u03bd\u2212 2\n\n!\u2212\u03bd\np\n4i|A * k| \u03b3 + \u01eb\u03b3 2\n,\nc2 k 2\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich is responsible for the anisotropic deformation of the\npower spectrum on large scales. Here \u03b1, \u03bd are given in\n(3.7). In the standard scenarios, A(k) is just A(k) = 1. In\nour case, A depends on k, not only on its amplitude k, but\nalso on it direction, more precisely, on \u00c2 * k\u0302 (see Fig. 1).\nWe would like to investigate the leading order effect of\nAi = \u2202i \u03c6\u0304. Taking the limit Ai \u2192 0 in (3.9) and using\nStirling's formula, we get\n\u221a\n\u03bd \u01eb\u03b3(A * k)\nA(k) = 1 \u2212 i\nc2 k\u00142\n\u0015\n\u03bd(\u03bd + 1)(4\u03bd \u2212 1)\n\u03b3(A * k)2 2\n2\n\u03bd(\u03bd\n\u2212\n1)\n+\n\u01eb\u03b3\n.\n\u2212\nc4 k 4\n3\n6\n(3.10)\n\n\f3\n1.5\n1.0\n\n1.00\n0.5\n0.0\n1.0\n\n0.95\n0.90\n\n0.5\n\n0.85\n0.80\n\n0.0\n4\n2\n\n0.75\n0.70\n\n0\n-2\n\nFIG. 1: Deformation factor |A(k)|2 as function of k = |k|\nand \u03b8, where cos \u03b8 \u2261 \u00c2 * k\u0302. Parameters are chosen as c = 2,\nA = \u03b3 = 1, \u01eb = 0.01, \u03bd = 1.52. We plot ln k from -3 to 4,\nand \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0/2.\n\nIt can be seen directly from (3.10) that the anisotropic deformation factor A(k) reduces to 1 when setting Ai = 0,\nas expected. Moreover, for those modes with wavenumbers k perpendicular to A, i.e. A * k = 0, it will be\nshown that A(k) = 1, that is, these modes do not feel the\npresence of A, and thus get no corrections. Modes with\nA * k 6= 0 will get corrections from A, but in the limit\nA \u2192 0 (or more precisely, typical scale of k much larger\nthan A, k \u226b |A|), it will also be shown that A(k) \u2192 1,\nwhich means that small scales get smaller anisotropic corrections from A.\nFrom (3.10),\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b3(A * k)2 4\n\u03bd(4\u03bd 2 \u2212 1)\n2\n\u03bd(\u03bd\n\u2212\n1)\n+\n\u01eb\u03b3\n.\nc4 k 4\n3\n3\n(3.11)\nIt is interesting to note that the leading order correction\nterm are quadrupole, there is no dipole correction.

First, the deviation from statistical isotropy of the\npower spectrum is not constant on all scales (while in [4]\nand other works it is often assumed that g(k) is a constant\ng\u2217 ). Statistical anisotropy of Cl spectrum mainly appears\nat the lowest l's, while the spectrum at higher l's remains\nhighly isotropic (this can be seen clearly from Fig.1, where\nfor smaller k, |A(k)| is highly anisotropic, while for larger\nk, |A(k)| remains flat). Second, for a given direction k\u0302,\nsince g(k) \u223c \u22121/k 2, the spectrum itself is suppressed at\nlarge scales (see Fig. 2). This phenomenon explains the\nloss of power at the lowest l's in the Cl spectrum.\nFinally, the power spectrum of scalar perturbation on su-\n\n0.001\n\n0.0050.010\n\n0.0500.100\n\n0.5001.000\n\nFIG. 2: Leading-order quadrupole terms of |A(k)|\n(for a given direction of k\u0302). The black dashed curve\nis the exact result, the red curve corresponds to the\nquadrupole term given in (3.10). Here we have chosen that k is parallel to A without loss of generality.\nParameters are chosen as A = 10\u22123 , c = 2, ns =\n0.96, \u01eb = 0.01. We plot k from 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.\n\nperhorizon scales reads,\nk3\n|\u03b4\u03c6k |2\n2\u03c0 2\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0012\n\u00133\u22122\u03bd\nH\nck\n|A(k)|2\n\u2243\n2\u03c0\naH\ncP,X\n\n\u22062\u03b4\u03c6 (k) \u2261\n\n(3.13)\n\n= \u22062\u03b4\u03c6 (k) |A(k)|2 ,\n\nwhere |A(k)|2 is given in (3.11). The general anisotropic\npower spectrum (3.13) is function of k and \u03b8. In our model,\nits shape is similar to that of |A(k)|2 (see Fig. 1).\nC.\n\nSuppression of Power on the Largest Scales\n\nThe observational data appear to suggest a spatial modulation in the CMB spectrum. Especially, a vanishing CMB\ntemperature auto-correlation on the largest scales has been\ninvestigated by several authors [3]. As mentioned before,\nthis can be naturally explained in our model, due to the\nsuppression behavior of |A(k)|, g(k) \u223c \u22121/k 2 , (see Figs.\n2 and 3).\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this work, we studied cosmological perturbations in\nthe presence of a superhorizon inhomogeneous inflaton\nbackground. We find that the leading-order correction\nto the standard isotropic power spectrum is a quadrupole\nanisotropy. Moreover, the deviation from isotropy is generally scale-dependent. More specifically, the quadrupole\ncorrection term has a suppression factor g(k) \u223c \u22121/k 2 .\nAnd thus our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic alignment of the low-l multipoles and\ntheir low power. If the indication of these large scale CMB\nanomalies were to be confirmed by future experiments, the\nwork presented here would improve our understanding of\ninflation and the very early universe.\n\n\f4\n0.04\n\nD2 HkL\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.00\n0.001\n\n0.005 0.01\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n1.\n\nk\n\nFIG. 3: Suppression of the power on the largest scales\n(for a given direction k\u0302).

Parameters are chosen as \u01eb = 0.01,\n\u03b3 = H = 1, c = 1.2. The range of k is from 10\u22123 to\n1.\n\n[15], anisotropic inflationary models and perturbations are\ninvestigated, where an anisotropic spectrum is also produced. In a FRW background, the quantization procedure\nis well understood for canonical variables on sub-Hubble\nscales, where they evolve adiabatically, and thus the adiabatic vacuum is well defined. In this work, we choose\nthe mode solution (3.6) by simply noticing that (3.6) reduces to the standard mode solution in the Ai \u2192 0 limit.\nIt should be noted, however, that the frequency term in the\nsecond-line of (3.5) is divergent when \u03b7 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, due to the\npresence of the anisotropic term \u03b3(A * k)2 /(aH)2 . Thus,\nthe presence of a WKB regime and also the quantization\nprocedure in this case are non-trivial in general (see e.g.\ndiscussions in [15]). We would like to investigate these\nproblems in future work.\nIndeed, the work presented here is a general framework,\nwhile the results of our model are generic. A more detailed study including metric perturbations and possible\nnon-FRW background geometry is needed. We would like\nto present it in a companion work [13].\n\nIn our work, the inhomogeneous background affects the\nperturbation through the non-linear structure of P (X, \u03c6) of\nX. A similar effect would arise when one consider backreaction of superhorizon perturbations through the nonlinearity of the Einstein equations [10].\nIn our approximations, we neglected the backreaction\nof the inhomogeneous inflaton background to the geometry, which has to be considered in a more rigorous analysis.\nIn that case, a non-FRW metric may arise.
