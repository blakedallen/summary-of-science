Introduction\n\nFrom recent studies it seems well established that our universe is currently in an accelerating phase. The evidence\nof cosmic acceleration has arisen not only from the high-redshift surveys of type Ia supernovae [1, 2], but also from\nthe anisotropy power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background [3, 4]. One of the most accepted explanations\nis that the universe has been dominated by some form of dark energy for a long time. However, none of the existing\ndark energy models are completely satisfactory.\nIt is possible to find other explanations for cosmic expansion using field equations other than Einstein's equations.\nRecently, some authors have proposed to add a R\u22121 term in the Einstein-Hilbert action to modify general relativity\n[5]. They have obtained the field equations using the second order formalism, varying only the metric field, and have\nthus derived the so-called fourth-order field equations. Although the models were obtained using corrections of the\nHilbert-Einstein Lagrangian of type Rn , where n can take a positive or negative value to explain both the inflation at\nan early time and the expansion at the present time[6]. Apart from this ad hoc justification, there are also theoretical\nmotivations for non-linear gravity from M-theory [6]. However, this model still suffer violent instabilities [7] which\nmaybe deleted by the addition of a R2 -like term to the Lagranngian [6] or by account of quantum effects [8]. A big\nreview on various modified gravities and its applications to cosmology was analyzed in [9], and the Newtonian limit\nof these fourth order theories has been studied by Dick [10]\n\u221a\nThere are also theories that are obtained from a Lagrangian density Lt = \u2212gf (r) + Lm , which depends on the\nscalar of curvature and a matter Lagrangian does not depends on the connection,on this Lagrangian we can apply\nPalatini's method to obtain the field equations [11, 12]. In references [11, 12], we showed the universality of the\nEinstein equation using a cosmological constant. More recently, M. Ferraris, M.Francaviglia and I. Volovich published\nthe same result [13, 14]. For these theories we have studied the conserved quantities [15], the spherically symmetric\nsolutions [16], the Newtonian limit [11, 12, 17], and the Cosmology described by FRW metric [18].\nIn [17], it was shown that is very difficult to test these models in the (post-) Newtonian approximation. The reason\nfor this is that the departures from Newtonian behavior are both very small and are masked by other effects, due to\nthe fact that these departures have to be measured when the body is moving \"through\" a matter-filled region.\na2\nRecently, Vollick [19] used the Lagrangian f (R) = R \u2212 3R\n, together with the Palatini variational principle to prove\nthat the solution of field equations approach the De Sitter universe at a late time. This result was obtained using,\nthe well known property of the vacuum solutions of these theories, that in a vacuum, or in the case of T = constant,\nthe solutions are the same as in General Relativity with a cosmological constant, even when f (R) is not analytical at\nR = 0[14, 16, 17].\nOn the other hand, solutions corresponding to different cosmological constants are allowed by some of these theories.\nTherefore, the homogeneous and isotropic vacuum solution for these theories is the deSitter space-time with different\ncosmological constants, except when one of the allowed cosmological constants is \u039b = 0, which corresponds to flat\nspace-time. Thus, the inclusion of 1/R curvature terms in the gravitational Lagrangian provides us with an alternative\nexplanation for cosmological acceleration. The generalization to the case of scalar tensorial theories was analyzed in\n[20].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: barraco famaf.unc.edu.ar\n\n\f2\nIn the present work, we use the first order or Palatini formalism [11] in order\n\u221a to obtain the hydrostatic equilibrium\nequation, for theories that are obtained from the Lagrangian density L = \u2212gf (R) which depends on the scalar of\ncurvature, and a matter Lagrangian that does not depend on the connection. This is done by means of a Legendre\ntransformation which in classical mechanics replaces the Lagrangian of a mechanical system with the Helmholtz\na2\n, is a\nLagrangian [21]. From this equation we have found the Newtonian limit in the particular case f (R) = R \u2212 3R\ngood Newtonian limit in same cases and is not in others. This limit has been treated in the literature [22, 23]with\nno consensus about what the background metric is, that has to be perturbed. In this sense, the difference from\nprevious works is that we obtain this limit from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and we assume nothing about\n1 an+1\nthe background metric. In addition, we generalize the above result for the case f (R) = R \u2212 n+2\nRn . Also, for this\ntheory we see that the departure from Newtonian behavior is smaller as n increase.\nIn the next section we review the field equations and the basic structure of the theory. In section III we derive\nthe static spherically symmetric solution. In section IV we derive the equilibrium hydrostatic equation, modeling the\nstar as a perfect fluid for f (R) theories of gravity. In the following section we determine the weak field limit from\nthis equation. In section VI we calculate the weak field limit for singular f (R) gravity model, and in section VIII we\nshow the conclusions. This work is part of a graduation thesis [24]\nII. Helmholtz Lagrangian in the first order formalism\n\nThe action for an f (R) gravity in the Jordan(original) gauge with the metric gab is given by [25]\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS=\n\u2212gf (R)d4 x + Sm (gab , \u03c8),\n(1)\n2\u03b1m\n\u221a\nHere \u2212gf (R), is a Lagrangian density that depends on the curvature scalar R = Rab (\u0393cde )g ab , Sm is the action for\nmatter represented symbolically by \u03c8 and independent of the connection, and \u03b1m = 8\u03c0G, where we have taken c \u2261 1.\nWe consider that we have a smooth one-parameter (\u03bb) family of field configurations starting from given fields g ab ,\nc\n\u0393de and \u03c8, with appropriate boundary conditions and, denote by \u03b4g ab , \u03b4\u0393cab , \u03b4\u03c8 the corresponding variations, i.e.,\nab\n\u03b4g ab = dgd\u03bb |\u03bb=0 \u03b4\u03bb, etc. Variation of the action Sj with respect to gab yields the field equations [11]\n1\nf \u2032 (R)Rab \u2212 f (R)gab = \u03b1m Tab ,\n2\n\n(2)\n\ndf\n) and the dynamical energy-moment tensor of matter is generated taking variation of the action\nwhere f \u2032 (R) = ( dR\nof matter with respect to the Jordan metric tensor:\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nTab \u2212gd4 x\u03b4g ab .\n(3)\n\u03b4Sm = \u2212\n2\n\nThe trace of field equation (2), gives\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) = \u03b1m T,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere (4) fixes a unique relation, in general non-linear, between R and T .

Thus ua = \u221a 1\u2032 \u0169a and\nf (\u03c6)\n\nTab (g\u0303cd [f \u2032 (\u03c6)]\u22121 ) = \u03c1\u0303\u0169a \u0169b + p\u0303(g\u0303ab + \u0169a \u0169b ),\n\u2032\n\n(27)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere p\u0303 = p/f (\u03c6) and \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c1/f (\u03c6).

Therefore, in\nthe Jordan gauge, a test particle will follow the geodesics of the metric connection but this is not true in the Einstein\ngauge.\nWe assume the Jordan gauge as the physical, in order to research observational consequence of this hypothesis.\nThe equation (30) is written in Jordan gauge, and the energy momentum tensor is given by (26) since we model\nthe star as a perfect fluid. Choosing the four-velocity pointing into the future like direction and normalizing it to\nua ua = \u22121, it becomes\np\nu\u03bc = ( A(r\u2032 ), 0, 0, 0),\n(31)\nFor our metric, in Jordan gauge (21), the only nontrivial component gives,\n\n(p + \u03c1) tt dgtt\ndp\n=\u2212\n,\ng\ndr\u2032\n2\ndr\u2032\nand in order to combine this equation with equation (29), we now have to consider equation (6), then:\np\ndp\n(p + \u03c1) d\u03b3\n(p + \u03c1) d f \u2032 (\u03c6)\n=\u2212\n+p\n.\ndr\u2032\n2 dr\u2032\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) dr\u2032\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nMaking a change by taking into account r\u2032 = \u221a r\u2032\n\nf (\u03c6)\n\np\n\u2032\np\nd\u03b3\n\u2032 d f (\u03c6) d\u03b3\n\u2032\n= ( f (\u03c6) + r\n) ,\n\u2032\ndr\ndr\u2032\ndr\nand putting everything in terms of r\u2032 on the right hand side of equation (29), we can write:\np\nd f \u2032 (\u03c6) r\u20323 (\u03b1m p[f \u2032 (\u03c6)]\u22121 \u2212 f \u2032 (\u03c6)V (\u03c6)) + 2M\u0303 (r\u2032 )\nd\u03b3\nr\u2032\n= (1 + p\n)(\n).\ndr\u2032\ndr\u2032\nr\u2032 (r\u2032 \u2212 2M\u0303 (r\u2032 ))\nf \u2032 (\u03c6)\n\nFinally, we are ready to write the equilibrium hydrostatic equation in the Jordan gauge:\np\nd f \u2032 (\u03c6)\ndp\n1\n1\nr\u2032\n\u2212\n= (1 + p\n)\u00d7\n(p + \u03c1) dr\u2032\n2\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) dr\u2032\np\nd f \u2032 (\u03c6)\nr\u20323 (\u03b1m p[f \u2032 (\u03c6)]\u22121 \u2212 f \u2032 (\u03c6)V (\u03c6)) + 2M\u0303 (r\u2032 )\n1\n(\n.\n)\u2212 p\ndr\u2032\nr\u2032 (r\u2032 \u2212 2M\u0303 (r\u2032 ))\nf \u2032 (\u03c6)\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nThe equation (36) can be seen as equivalent to Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, (for a different approach see\n[29]). It is easy to show that for General Relativity, i.e. f (\u03c6) = \u03c6, the equation (36) becomes the known result. This\nequation is very difficult to solve, for any model different from General Relativity, even if we consider an incompressible\nfluid.\n\n\f6\nV.

However, the Taylor expansion (37) can be done in general, when \u03c1 is\na2\n, in which the condition in order to keep the linear\nsmall enough, but not for singular theories of type f (R) = R \u2212 3R\nterm in \u03c1 is \u03c1\u03b1m \u226a a [22], where a is essentially the vacuum energy density with \u03c1vac = a/\u03b1m \u223c 10\u221231 [gr/cm3 ]. It\nis obvious that the mean density of our solar system \u03c1 \u223c 10\u221211 [gr/cm3 ] does not satisfy this condition, and then we\ncan not use the above approximation. Therefore, in the next section we will study the weak field limit for this kind\nof theories in the case of \u03c1 being of order of the mean density of our solar system.\nVI. Newtonian limit of the singular f (R) gravity\n2\n\nTheories like those presented in [19], i.e. R\u2212 aR , which have a pole in R = 0, seem to explain the present accelerated\nexpansion. But,there are still some obscure points about how to obtain their behavior in a weak field limit, particularly\nwhat metric we have to use as a background metric. Dominguez and Barraco [23] perturbed around the de Sitter\nspace-time, which is the maximal symmetric vacuum solution of the theory. Sotiriou [22] claimed that this procedure\nwas erroneous, when \u03c1 is near the mean density of the solar system, which, according to the final part of the last\nsection, is correct. Therefore, he perturbed around the flat metric, which is not a solution of the theories but it could\nbe near the vacuum solutions.\nIn our present work we suppose nothing about the background metric in order to obtain the Newtonian limit, and\nthis is one of the principal difference with the previous works. First we find this limit for the theory:\nf (R) = R \u2212\n\na2\n.\n3R\n\n(47)\n\nFor this theory, equation (4) gives\n\u03c6(T ) =\n\np\n1\n(\u2212\u03b1m T \u00b1 \u03b12m T 2 + 4a2 ),\n2\n\n(48)\n\nwhere we have to choose the minus sign in front the square root, in order to return to General Relativity when a \u2212\u2192 0.\nWe consider, p \u226a \u03c1, r\u2032 \u226b Gm(r\u2032 ) and:\na\n\u226a 1.\n\u03b1m \u03c1\n\n(49)\n\nHere we are considering [22] \u03c1 = 10\u221211 [gr/cm3 ], a \u223c 10\u221267 [eV ]2 so |\nstate:\n\u03c6(T ) \u2248 \u03b1m \u03c1 + (\n\na\n\u03b1m \u03c1\n\na\n\u03b1m T\n\n|\u223c 10\u221221 where T \u2248 \u2212\u03c1.

Then, plugging into (36) we have,\n\u2212\n\nGm(r\u2032 ) 1 a 2 dT\nGm(r\u2032 )\ndp\n=\n\u03c1\n\u2212\n(1\n\u2212\n)\n(\n)\ndr\u2032\nr\u20322\n3 \u03b1m \u03c1 dr\u2032\nr\u2032\n\n\f8\n\u2248\u03c1\n\nGm(r\u2032 ) 1 a 2 d(3p \u2212 \u03c1)\n\u2212 (\n,\n)\nr\u20322\n3 \u03b1m \u03c1\ndr\u2032\n\n(51)\n\nwe have already neglected the pressure but we can't neglect its derivative. Therefore, the second line is obtained from\nthe first by substituting T = 3p \u2212 \u03c1. Using (49) we have, in the weak field approximation:\n\u2212\n\nGm(r\u2032 ) 1 a 2 d\u03c1\ndp\n\u2248\n\u03c1\n+ (\n,\n)\ndr\u2032\nr\u20322\n3 \u03b1m \u03c1 dr\u2032\n\n(52)\n\nwhere the terms of order a2 are kept only in gradients of \u03c1, where they are relevant. The extra term in equation (52)\na\nis the correction of lowest order in \u03b1m\n\u03c1 to the purely Newtonian behavior. Therefore, the last equation gives a good\nNewtonian limit for the theory. This limit is in accordance with the result obtained by Sotiriou.\nWe can show more generally that the theories\nf (R) = R \u2212\n\n1 an+1\n,\nn + 2 Rn\n\n(53)\n\nalso has a good Newtonian limit.

Then using the expressions\nf (\u03c6) \u2248 \u03b1m \u03c1 +\nf \u2032 (\u03c6) \u2248 1 +\n\nf \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6) \u2248 \u2212\n\na n\n2\n)a,\n(\nn + 2 \u03b1m \u03c1\n\nn\na n+1\n(\n)\n,\nn + 2 \u03b1m \u03c1\n\nn(n + 1) a n+1 1\n(\n)\n,\nn + 2 \u03b1m \u03c1\n\u03b1m \u03c1\n\n(55)\n\nconsidering these approximations in the context of equation (36) and carrying out exactly the same procedure as\nbefore:\n\u2212\n\ndp\nGm(r\u2032 ) n (n + 1) a n+1 d\u03c1\n\u2248\u03c1\n+\n.\n(\n)\n\u2032\ndr\nr\u20322\n2 (n + 2) \u03b1m \u03c1\ndr\u2032\n\n(56)\n\na\nWhere the last term is the correction of lowest order in \u03b1m\n\u03c1 . Note that for the case n = 1, the last equation returns\nto equation (52) and for n = 0 we return to General Relativity\nFinally, the above equation shows that these theories have also a good Newtonian limit.\n\nVII. Conclusions\n\nWe have obtained the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in the Jordan gauge, where the matter obeys simple conservation laws. This equation is the generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in General Relativity.\nWe have studied the Newtonian Limit, in this gauge, from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, and in section V\nwe found an expression in the weak field limit for the pressure gradient. In this section we saw that this result is not\na2\ncorrect if we consider f (R) = R \u2212 3R\ngravity models with density typically related to a Newtonian regime. However\ndp\nis\nperfectly\naccurate\nfor this singular gravity if the conditions are such that \u03b1m \u03c1 \u226a a. And,\nthe expansion (46) for dr\n\u2032\nif this is the case, the theory does not give a good Newtonian Limit as previously shown Barraco and Dominguez [23].\n1 an+1\na2\n, and its generalization, f (R) = R \u2212 n+2\nIn section VI we have shown that the singular theory, f (R) = R \u2212 3R\nRn ,\nhave good Newtonian limits for densities such as the mean density of the solar system. The difference with previous\nworks [22, 23] is that we found the Newtonian limit, in the spherically symmetric case, with no assumption about the\nbackground metric. Finally, in the general case, we have shown that n controls the departure from purely Newtonian\nbehavior.\n\n\f9\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are very grateful to CONICET and SeCYT, Argentina, for financial support.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\nA.
