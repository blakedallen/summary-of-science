We also discuss the moduli\nproblem for these Sasakian-Einstein structures.\n\n0. Introduction\nSurprisingly little is known about complete Einstein metrics on compact 5-manifolds.\nUntil now one could list only two constructions of such metrics. The more recent one was\ndeveloped by B\u00f6hm [B\u00f6] who obtained cohomogeneity one complete Einstein metrics on\nS 5 and S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . On the other hand, the well-known irreducible homogeneous Einstein\nmetrics on these two spaces are the simplest examples of what is called a Sasakian-Einstein\nstructure. In fact, any complex surface whose metric is K\u00e4hler-Einstein and of positive\nscalar curvature admits a unique simply connected circle bundle which is canonically\nSasakian-Einstein. Since all such del Pezzo surfaces Z admitting K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics\nare known [Siu,Ti1-3, TY] one gets the list and the classification statement of the first\ntheorem of the introduction. Purely in the context of Einstein metrics this construction\nis due to Kobayashi [Be] whereas the realization that S is actually a 5-manifold with real\nKilling spinors and, hence, Sasakian-Einstein space came later in the work of Friedrich\nand Kath [FK]. More generally, the importance of Killing spinors was already realized\nin 1980 in the context of the spectrum of that Dirac operator [F]. A classification of\nRiemannian manifolds admitting real Killing spinors was finally obtained by B\u00e4r [B\u00e4]\nwho observed that the real Killing spinors on M correspond to the parallel spinors on\nDuring the preparation of this work the first two authors were partially supported by NSF\ngrant DMS-9970904, and third author by NSF grant DMS-0070190. 1991 Mathematics Classification: 53C25, 53C12, 14E30\n\n1\n\n\fC(M ) = (R+ \u00d7 M, dt2 + t2 g) the metric cone on M . This simple fact allowed for an elegant\nformulation of the problem in the powerful language of holonomy groups.\nThe physicists' interest in five and seven-dimensional manifolds admitting real Killing\nspinors dates back to the early eighties, where Kaluza-Klein models played a central role\nin the supergravity theory. Today we witness a renewed interest in these manifolds in\nthe context of p-brane solutions in superstring theory. These so-called p-branes, \"near the\nhorizon\" are modeled by the pseudo-Riemannian geometry of the product adSp+2 \u00d7 M ,\nwhere adSp+2 is the (p + 2)-dimensional anti-de-Sitter space (a Lorentzian version of a\nspace of constant sectional curvature) and (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold of dimension\nd = D \u2212 p \u2212 2. Here D is the dimension of the original supersymmetric theory. In the\nmost interesting cases of M2-branes, M5-branes, and D3-branes D equals to either 11\n(Mp-branes of M-theory) or 10 (Dp-branes in type IIA or type IIB string theory). String\ntheorists are particularly interested in those vacua of the form adSp+2 \u00d7 M that preserve\nsome residual supersymmetry. It turns out that this requirement imposes constraints on\nthe geometry of the Einstein manifold M which is forced to admit real Killing spinors.\nDepending on the dimension d, the possible geometries of M are as follows: nearly K\u00e4hler\nfor d = 6, weak G2 holonomy for d = 7, Sasakian-Einstein for d = 2k + 1, and 3-Sasakian\nfor d = 4k + 3 [AFHS, MP]. Furthermore, given a p-brane solution of the above type,\nthe interpolation between adSp+2 \u00d7 M and Rp,1 \u00d7 C(M ) leads to a conjectured duality\nbetween supersymmetric background of the form adSp+2 \u00d7 M and a (p + 1)-dimensional\nsuperconformal field theory of n coincident p-branes located at the conical singularity of\nthe Rp,1 \u00d7 C(M ) vacuum. This is a generalized version of the Maldacena's conjecture.\nIn the case of D3-branes of string theory the relevant near horizon geometry is that of\nadS5 \u00d7M , where M is a Sasakian-Einstein 5-manifold. The D3-brane solution interpolates\nbetween adS5 \u00d7M and R3,1 \u00d7C(M ), where the cone C(M ) is a Calabi-Yau threefold. In its\noriginal version the Maladacena conjecture (also known as AdS/CFT duality) states that\nthe 't Hooft large n limit of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group\nSU (n) is dual to type IIB superstring theory on adS5 \u00d7 S 5 [Ma, Wi]. This conjecture was\nfurther examined by Klebanov and Witten [KW] for the type IIB theory on adS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 ,\nwhere T 1,1 is the other homogeneous Sasakian-Einstein 5-manifold T 1,1 = S 2 \u00d7 S 3 and the\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold C(T 1,1 ) is simply the quadric cone in C4 . Using the well-known fact that\nC(T 1,1 ) is a K\u00e4hler quotient of C4 (or, equivalently, that S 2 \u00d7 S 3 is a Sasakian-Einstein\nquotient of S 7 ), a dual super Yang-Mills theory was proposed, representing D3-branes at\nthe conical singularities. In the framework of D3-branes and the AdS/CFT duality the\nquestion of what are all the possible near horizon geometries M and C(M ) might be of\nimportance. Until this year, the only known examples of such geometries were few and\nthey were exactly the circle bundles over the del Pezzo surfaces (see the comment of Yau\nin [Y]). This has drastically changed now as we shall show in our paper.\nRecently Demailly and Koll\u00e1r have developed some new techniques to study the existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on compact Fano orbifolds [DK], and applied their\nmethods to prove the existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on three log del Pezzo surfaces.\nFollowing this, two of the present authors [BG3] showed how one can use the results of\n[DK] to obtain new Sasakian-Einstein 5-manifolds. Later Johnson and Koll\u00e1r [JK1] discovered a more efficient way to treat the algebraic equation involved, and with the aid\nof a computer program gave many more examples of log del Pezzo surfaces in weighted\nprojective 3-spaces, including one infinite series example. All of the [JK1] examples have\nFano index equal to one. In the current paper we extend the results of [JK1] to the case of\n2\n\n\fhigher index as well as use these results together with the results of [JK1] to construct a\nplethora of Sasakian-Einstein metrics in dimension five. This is accomplished by realizing\nthe compact simply connected 5-manifolds as links of isolated hypersurface singularities\ngiven by weighted homogeneous polynomials in C4 . The projectivization then gives the\nlog del Pezzo surfaces Z and proving the existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric Z is then\ntantamount to proving the existence of an Sasakian-Einstein metric on the 5-manifold. It\nturns out that from the work of Smale [Sm] one can deduce that these 5-manifolds are all\nof the form Sl = #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 7. We also show that the moduli of SasakianEinstein structures on #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) is exceedingly rich. First it is known [FK,BG1] that\nthe regular Sasakian-Einstein structures on #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) satisfy\nTheorem [FK,BG1]: Let Sl = S 5 #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ).\n1) For each l = 0, 1, 3, 4, there is precisely one regular Sasakian-Einstein structure on Sl .\n2) For each 5 \u2264 l \u2264 8 there is a 2(l \u22124) complex parameter family of inequivalent regular\nSasakian-Einstein structures on Sl .\n3) For l = 2 or l \u2265 9 there are no regular Sasakian-Einstein structures on Sl .\nThe first non-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures on any 5-manifold were given in\n[BG3]. Here the two of the present authors showed the existence of two inequivalent nonregular Sasakian-Einstein structures on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 , and one non-regular Sasakian-Einstein\nstructure on #2(S 2 \u00d7S 3 ). The latter was the first example of any Sasakian-Einstein metric\non #2(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ). In the present work we use the methods presented in [BG3] as well as\nthose in [JK1] to greatly expand the list of non-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures on\nsimply connected 5-manifolds. Explicitly we prove the following:\nTheorem A:\n1) S 2 \u00d7 S 3 admits 14 inequivalent non-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures.\n2) #2(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits two distinct 1-complex parameter families plus 21 inequivalent\nnon-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures.\n3) #3(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits two distinct 2-complex parameter families, and four distinct\n1-complex parameter families, and one countably infinite family of inequivalent nonregular Sasakian-Einstein structures.\n4) #4(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits two distinct 3-parameter complex families, one 2-complex parameter family, two countably infinite complex families, and two distinct inequivalent\nnon-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures.\n5) #5(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits one 4-complex parameter family, one 3-complex parameter family, and two countably infinite families of inequivalent non-regular Sasakian-Einstein\nstructures.\n6) #6(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits one 5-complex parameter family, one 3-complex parameter family, and two countably infinite families of inequivalent non-regular Sasakian-Einstein\n3\n\n\fstructures.\n7) #7(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) admits a countably infinite series of 5-complex parameter families of\ninequivalent non-regular Sasakian-Einstein structures.\nFurthermore, inequivalent Sasakian structures correspond to inequivalent Riemannian\nmetrics.\nIn light of these results an outstanding question is:\nQuestion: Are there any Sasakian-Einstein structures on #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) for l \u2265 9?\nIt is well-known for the regular case that the second Betti number of any smooth del\nPezzo surface is less than or equal to 9. However, in stark contrast to this one can construct\nlog del Pezzo surfaces with any desired second Betti number, but as shown in Theorem 4.5\nbelow the methods used in this paper for proving the existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics\napply only to log del Pezzo surfaces with second Betti number less than or equal to 10.\nIndeed, we shall show in a forthcoming work that our methods prove the existence of a\n7-complex parameter family of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on a log del Pezzo surface whose\nsecond Betti number is 10; hence, proving the existence of a 7-complex parameter family\nof Sasakian-Einstein structures on #9(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ).\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Alex Buium, for several discussions, and\nJ\u00e1nos Koll\u00e1r for many valuable e-mail communications as well as his interest in our work.\nWe also thank Gang Tian for e-mail communications, and Gueo Grantcharov for telling us\nabout Pontecorvo's result [Pon] which allowed us to sharpen some results on the moduli\nspaces which appeared in the first version of this manuscript.

The Transverse Geometry of a Sasakian Manifold\nIn this section we study the transverse geometry of the Riemannian foliation F\u03be of a\nSasakian manifold M. Good references for the transverse geometry of foliations are [Ton]\nand [Mol]. We first make note of some well known properties. The foliation F\u03be is one\ndimensional whose leaves are geodesics with respect to the Sasakian metric g, and this\nmetric is bundle-like.\nLet (M, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) be a Sasakian manifold, and consider the contact subbundle D =\nker \u03b7. There is an orthogonal splitting of the tangent bundle as\n1.1\n\nT M = D \u2295 L\u03be ,\n\nwhere L\u03be is the trivial line bundle generated by the Reeb vector field \u03be. The contact\nsubbundle D is just the normal bundle to the characteristic foliation F\u03be generated by \u03be. It\nis naturally endowed with both a complex structure J = \u03a6|D and a symplectic structure\nd\u03b7. Hence, (D, J, d\u03b7) gives M a transverse K\u00e4hler structure with K\u00e4hler form d\u03b7 and\nmetric gD defined by\n1.2\n\ngD (X, Y ) = d\u03b7(X, JY )\n4\n\n\fwhich is related to the Sasakian metric g by\n1.3\n\ng = gD \u2295 \u03b7 \u2297 \u03b7.\n\nRecall [Ton] that a smooth p-form \u03b1 on M is called basic if\n1.4\n\n\u03be\u230b\u03b1 = 0,\n\nL\u03be \u03b1 = 0,\n\nand we let \u039bpB denote the sheaf of germs of basic p-forms on M, snd by \u03a9pB the set of\nglobal sections of \u039bpB on M. The sheaf \u039bpB is a module under the ring, \u039b0B , of germs of\n\u221e\nsmooth basic functions on M. We let CB\n(M ) = \u03a90B denote global sections of \u039b0B , i.e. the\nring of smooth basic functions on M.

Here we denote cohomology classes in HB\nin order to distinquish them from the ordinary cohomology classes. We also note that d\u03b7\nis basic even though \u03b7 is not.\nNext we exploit the fact that the transverse geometry is K\u00e4hler [ElK]. Let DC denote\nthe complexification of D, and decompose it into its eigenspaces with respect to J, that\nis, DC = D 1,0 \u2295 D 0,1 .

Most of the usual results\ntogether with its basic Dolbeault cohomology groups HB\nabout K\u00e4hler geometry carry over to transverse K\u00e4hler geometry [ElK]. In particular, we\nhave the following Proposition which follows from transverse K\u00e4hler geometry:\n\nProposition 1.9: Let (M, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) be a compact Sasakian manifold of dimension 2n + 1.\nThen we have\nn,n\n2n\n(1) HB\n(F\u03be ) \u2248 HB\n(F\u03be ) \u2248 R.\n1,1\n(F\u03be ) is nontrivial.\n(2) The class [d\u03b7]B \u2208 HB\np,p\n(F\u03be ) > 0.\n(3) HB\n2p+1\n(F\u03be ) has even dimension.\n(4) HB\n1\n(5) H 1 (M, R) \u2248 HB\n(F\u03be ).\nr\n(6) HB\n(F\u03be ) =\n\nL\n\np+q=r\n\np,q\n(F\u03be ).\nHB\n\nq,p\np,q\n(F\u03be ).\n(F\u03be ) \u2248 HB\n(7) Complex conjugation induces an anti-linear isomorphism HB\n\n(8) If \u03c9 is a closed real (1, 1) form such that \u03c9 \u2208 [d\u03b7]B , then there exists a smooth basic\n \u0304\nfunction \u03c6 such that \u03c9 = d\u03b7 + i\u2202 \u2202\u03c6.\nj2n+1\n\n2n\n(F\u03be ). (2):\nProof: (1): The exact sequence 1.6 gives an isomorphism H 2n+1 (M ) \u2248 HB\nn\nd\u03b7 is a (1,1) form by 1.2, and since \u03b7 \u2227 (d\u03b7) is a volume form on M, the isomorphism\n2\n(F\u03be ). (3) follows since [d\u03b7]B cups to\nj2n+1 implies that d\u03b7 defines a nontrivial class in HB\nn,n\na non-trivial element in HB (F\u03be ). (4): This follows from transverse Hodge theory in the\nusual way [ElK].\n\nTo prove (5) we notice that the beginning of the exact sequence 1.6 is\nj1\n\n\u03b40\n\n2\n1\n(F\u03be ).\n0\u2212\u2212\u2192HB\n(F\u03be )\u2212\u2212\u2192H 1 (M, R) \u2212\u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2212\u2192 HB\n\nBy (2) \u03b40 is injective, so {0} = ker \u03b40 = im j1 ; hence, j1 is the zero map. (6) and (7)\nfollow from (1) and Theorem 3.4.6 of [ElK], and (8) is Proposition 3.5.1 of [ElK].\nNext we define the transverse Ricci tensor RicTg of g to be the Ricci tensor of gD . It\nis related to the Ricci tensor Ricg of g by\n1.10a\n\nRicTg = Ricg |D\u00d7D + 2g|D\u00d7D .\n\nSimilarly, we define the Ricci form \u03c1g and transverse Ricci form \u03c1Tg by\n1.10b\n\n\u03c1Tg (X, Y ) = RicTg (X, \u03a6Y )\n\n\u03c1g (X, Y ) = Ricg (X, \u03a6Y ),\n6\n\n\ffor X, Y smooth sections of D. It is easy to check that these are anti-symmetric of type\n(1, 1) and are related by\n\u03c1Tg = \u03c1g + 2d\u03b7.\n\n1.10c\n\nNow the contact subbundle D is a complex vector bundle and thus has a first Chern\nclass c1 (D) \u2208 H 2 (M, Z). Consider the long exact sequence 1.6 together with the natural\nmap H 2 (M, Z)\u2212\u2212\u2192H 2 (M, R) whose kernel is the torsion part of H 2 (M, Z). From (5) of\nProposition 1.9 we have\n\n1.11\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b9\u2217\n\nH 2 (M,\n\uf8e6 Z)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\n2\n(F\u03be ) \u2212\u2212\u2192 H 2 (M, R)\u2212\u2212\u2192H 1 (M, R)\u2212\u2212\u2192 * * * .\n0\u2212\u2192R \u2212\u2212\u2192 HB\n\nAs in 1.6 the map \u03b4 is given by \u03b4(c) = c[d\u03b7] where c \u2208 R. Now on a Sasakian manifold the\nvector bundle D 1,0 is holomorphic with respect to the CR-structure, so we can compute the\nfree part of c1 (D) = c1 (D 1,0 ) from the transverse K\u00e4hler geometry in the usual way. That\nis c1 (D) can be represented by a basic real closed (1, 1)-form \u03c1B . The class cB\n1 = [\u03c1B ] \u2208\n2\nHB (F\u03be ) is independent of the transverse metric and basic connection used to compute it,\nand depends only on the foliated manifold (M, F\u03be ) with its CR-structure. It is described\nin [ElK] and called the basic first Chern class of D there. Alternatively, we can think of cB\n1\nn\n)\nas the negative of the first Chern class of the \"transverse canonical bundle\" K = (\u039b1,0\nB\nof M.\nWe now consider deformations of the Sasakian structure which fix the basic first Chern\nclass cB\n1 . We do this by considering deformations that fix the foliation F\u03be , in fact fix the\ncharacteristic vector field \u03be. Let \u03b7t be a continuous one parameter family of real1-forms\nobtained by adding to \u03b7 a continuous family of basic 1-forms \u03b6t so that \u03b7t = \u03b7 + \u03b6t satisfies\nthe conditions\n1.12\n\n\u03b70 = \u03b7,\n\n\u03b60 = 0,\n\n\u03b7t \u2227 (d\u03b7t )n 6= 0 \u2200 t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nThis last non-degeneracy condition implies that \u03b7t is a contact form on M for all t \u2208 [0, 1].\nThen by Gray's Stability Theorem \u03b7t belongs to the same underlying contact structure as\n\u03b7. Moreover, since \u03b6t is basic \u03be is the Reeb (characteristic) vector field associated to \u03b7t for\nall t. Now let us define\n1.13\n\n\u03a6t = \u03a6 \u2212 \u03be \u2297 \u03b6t \u25e6 \u03a6,\n\ngt = d\u03b7t \u25e6 (id \u2297 \u03a6t ) + \u03b7t \u2297 \u03b7t .\n\nIn [BG3] it was proved that for each t \u2208 [0, 1], (\u03be, \u03b7t , \u03a6t , gt ) defines a Sasakian structure on\nM associated to the foliation F\u03be and belonging to the same underlying contact structure as\n\u03b7. These new Sasakian structures correspond to a different splitting of the tangent bundle,\nnamely\n1.14\n\nT M = L \u03be \u2295 Dt\n7\n\n\fwhich is orthogonal with respect to the metric gt , where Dt = ker \u03b7t .\nGiven a Sasakian structure (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) on a manifold M, we define F(\u03be) to be the\nfamily of all Sasakian structures obtained by the deformations above. We are now ready\nfor\nDefinition 1.15: Two Sasakian structures S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) and S \u2032 = (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03a6\u2032 , g \u2032 ) on M\n1,1\nare said to be homologous if \u03be \u2032 = \u03be and [d\u03b7]B = [d\u03b7 \u2032 ]B \u2208 HB\n(F ). In this case we also say\n\u2032\nthat the Sasakian metrics g and g are homologous.\nNotice that if L\u03be\u2032 = L\u03be we can always scale the Sasakian structure by choosing \u03be \u2032 = \u03be,\nso there is no loss in generality by choosing the characterstic vector fields to coincide. We\nhave\nProposition 1.16: Any two Sasakian structures in F(\u03be) are homologous and the class\n1,1\n2\ncB\n1 \u2208 HB (F\u03be ) \u2282 HB (F\u03be ) depends only on the family F(\u03be).\nProof: The first statement follows from (8) of Proposition 1.9, while the second statement follows from the fact that for all t \u2208 [0, 1] the complex vector bundles (Dt , \u03a6t ) are\nisomorphic. The isomorphism between D and Dt is given by the map\nI \u2212 \u03be \u2297 \u03b6t : T M \u2212\u2212\u2192T M,\nand the induced map on the exterior bundle \u039bD is\nI \u2212 \u03b6t \u2297 \u03be\nwhich is the identity on basic forms.\nNow we wish to consider the Sasakian analogue of the Calabi problem. Its solution\nessentially follows from the 'transverse Yau Theorem' given by El Kacimi-Alaoui [ElK]:\nT\nTheorem 1.17[ElK]: If cB\n1 is represented by a real basic (1, 1) form \u03c1 , then it is the Ricci\ncurvature form of a unique transverse K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 T in the same basic cohomology class\nas d\u03b7.\n\nThis is given in local CR-coordinates (zi , z\u0304i , x) on M by solving the \"transverse\nMonge-Ampere equation\"\n1.18\n\ndet(giTj\u0304 + \u03c6ij\u0304 )\ndet(giTj\u0304 )\n\n= e\u2212k\u03c6+F ,\n\ngiTj\u0304 + \u03c6ij\u0304 > 0,\n\nfor the k = 0 case. Here g T is the transverse metric, \u03c6 and F are real basic functions, and\n \u0304 = d\u03b6t with respect to the transverse coordinates (zi , z\u0304j\u0304 ).\n\u03c6ij\u0304 are the components of i\u2202 \u2202\u03c6\nThen by 1.10c this translates for Sasakian geometry to:\nThereom 1.19: Let (M, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) be a Sasakian manifold whose basic first Chern class\ncB\n1 is represented by the real basic (1, 1) form \u03c1, then there is a unique Sasakian structure\n8\n\n\f(\u03be, \u03b71 , \u03a61 , g1 ) \u2208 F(\u03be) homologous to (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) such that \u03c1g1 = \u03c1 \u2212 2d\u03b71 is the Ricci form\nof g1 , and \u03b71 = \u03b7 + \u03b61 , with \u03b61 = 21 dc \u03c6. The metric g1 and endomorphism \u03a61 are then\ngiven by 1.12.\nNotice that the Ricci forms are related by\n1.20\n\n1\n\u03c1 = \u03c1g + ddc (F \u2212 \u03c6).\n2\n\nNext we discuss a positivity requirement on the basic Chern class of a compact\nSasakian manifold.\nDefinition 1.21: A Sasakian manifold M is said to be positive if its basic first Chern\nclass cB\n1 can be represented by a positive definite (1, 1)-form.\nNotice that a positive Sasakian manifold does not necessarily have a metric with\npositive Ricci curvature; however, Theorem 1.19 does imply:\nProposition 1.22: A Sasakian manifold (M, g, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6) is positive if and only if there is a\nSasakian metric g \u2032 homologous to g whose Ricci curvature satisfies the bound Ricg \u2032 > \u22122.\nIn particular, a complete positive Sasakian manifold is compact with finite fundamental\ngroup.\nSince a Sasakian-Einstein manifold necessarily has positive Ricci tensor, its Sasakian\nstructure is necessarily positive. We are interested in sufficient conditions on a Sasakian\nmanifold that guarentee the existence of a Sasakian-Einstein structure. These conditions\nare algebraic geometric in nature, so we need to impose another condition on the Sasakian\nstructure, namely that it is quasi-regular. Recall that the toral rank or just rank defined\n[BG2] is the dimension of the closure of the characteristic foliation and denoted by rk(M ).\nFor a Sasakian manifold M 2n+1 of dimension 2n + 1 we have 1 \u2264 rk(M ) \u2264 n + 1. The case\nrk(M ) = 1 corresponds to the quasi-regular case, and if rk(M ) > 1 there are infinitely\nmany rank one structures that are close in an appropriate sense [BG2]. In the remainder of\nthis paper we are essentially interested in the rank one case only. Now the aforementioned\nalgebraic geometric conditions which imply the existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric are\ndescribed in the works of Nadel [Na] and Demailly and Koll\u00e1r [DK]. The main point is\nthat the obstructions for finding a solution to the Monge-Ampere equations 1.18 involves\nthe non-triviality of certain multiplier ideal sheaves associated with effective canonical\nQ-divisors on the space of leaves Z. Consequently, if one can show that these multiplier\nideal sheaves coincide with the full structure sheaf, one obtains the existence of a K\u00e4hlerEinstein metric. Equivalently, and this is the approach of Johnson and Koll\u00e1r [JK1],\nthis is given in the language of Mori theory by the appellation Kawamata log terminal,\nwhose precise technical definition is given in 2.3 below. It is important to realize that\nthese conditions are only sufficient conditions for the existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics.\nIndeed, they do not hold in the case of complex projective space. We can easily reformulate\nthe Demailly-Koll\u00e1r result in terms of Sasakian geometry as\nTheorem 1.23: Let (S, g, \u03be) be a rank 1 positive Sasakian manifold and let Z denote the\nspace of leaves of the characteristic foliation, and KZ be its canonical bundle. Suppose\nfurther that for some \u01eb > 0 and every effective Q-divisor D on Z numerically equivalent\nn+\u01eb\nD) is klt. Then there is a Sasakian-Einstein metric g \u2032 on M\nto \u2212KZ the pair (Z, n+1\nhomologous to g.\n9\n\n\fProof: By Theorem 2.1 of [BG1] Z is a Q-factorial Fano variety,and by Demailly and\nKoll\u00e1r [DK] as stated in Theorem 7 of [JK1] Z has a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric. Thus, again\nby (iv) of Theorem 2.1 of [BG1] S has a Sasakian-Einstein metric.\nFinally we recall [BG1] that the orbifold Fano index or just index of a positive rank\n1 Sasakian manifold S is the largest positive integer I such that I1 KZ is an element of\nPicorb (Z) where KZ is the canonical V-bundle on Z. Thus, the index is just the generalization to the orbifold category of the usual notion of Fano index; however, it is important\nto notice that the index I is an invariant of the Sasakian structure on S; in fact, we have\nProposition 1.25: The orbifold Fano index I is an invariant of the family of Sasakian\nstructures F(\u03be).\n2. The Existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein Metrics\nIn this section we quickly review the basic definitions and theorems from minimal\nmodel theory; all of this can be found in [KMM]. Throughout this section X will denote\na normal projective variety defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic\nzero. By a variety we mean an integral separated scheme of finite type over k. Since X\nis normal, codim(Xsing , X) \u2265 2, where Xsing denotes the singular locus of X. The sheaf\nof K\u00e4hler differentials \u03a9X is locally free of rank dim X on Xreg := X\\Xsing . This gives a\nVdim X\nwell-defined invertible sheaf\n\u03a9Xreg on Xreg .\n\nDefinition 2.1: A canonical divisor KX is any Weil divisor with\nOXreg (KX ) \u2243\n\ndim\n^X\n\n\u03a9Xreg .\n\nKX is well defined modulo linear equivalence since codim(Xsing , X) \u2265 2. Because\nsingularities are essential in the study of minimal models, it is important to note the\ndistinction between Weil divisors and Cartier divisors.\nDefinition 2.2: A Weil divisor D \u2282 X is called Q\u2013Cartier if some integral multiple mD\nis a Cartier divisor, i.e. if OX (mD) is invertible. We say that X is Q\u2013factorial (or that\nX has at worst Q\u2013factorial singularities) if all Weil divisors are Q\u2013Cartier.\nThere is a certain class of singularities called \"log\u2013terminal\" which play an especially\nprominent role in the minimal model program.\nP\nDefinition 2.3: Let X be a normal variety and let \u2206 =\nai Ei be an effective Q\u2013Weil\ndivisor such that KX +\u2206 is Q\u2013Cartier. Assume 0 \u2264 ai < 1 and that the Ei are all distinct.\nThen the pair (X, \u2206) has only log\u2013terminal singularities (also called klt or Kawamata logterminal) if there exists a resolution of singularities \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X such that the union of the\n\u03c0\u2013exceptional locus and \u03c0 \u22121 (\u222aEi ) is a normal crossing divisor and\nX\nKY \u2261 \u03c0 \u2217 (KX + \u2206) +\nai Fi\n10\n\n\fwith ai > \u22121 for all \u03c0\u2013exceptional Fi (here \u2261 denotes numerical equivalence). If ai \u2265 \u22121\nthen the pair (X, \u2206) is said to have log\u2013canonical singularities. In the case where \u2206 = 0, X\nis said to have has log\u2013terminal (or log\u2013canonical) singularities. When \u2206 = 0 and ai > 0\n(resp. ai \u2265 0) X is said to have terminal singularities (resp. canonical singularities).\nNote that Koll\u00e1r and Mori, [KM] Definition 2.34, give a different definition of klt\nsingularities, one which does not require the \"boundary divisor\" \u2206 to be effective. However, in applications one almost always needs the effectivity hypothesis in order to apply\nthe machinery of the minimal model program. All varieties we encounter will have mild\nquotient singularities and hence will be Q\u2013factorial.\nDefinition 2.4: Suppose L is a line bundle on a variety X. We write\nBS(L) = {x \u2208 X : s(x) = 0 for all sections s \u2208 H 0 (X, L)}\nfor the base locus of L. If I \u2282 OX is an ideal sheaf then we will denote by BS(L \u2297 I) the\nbase locus of those sections \u03c3 \u2208 H 0 (X, L) whose zero locus contains the zero locus of I.\nWe will be interested in the case where X is a projective surface with mild quotient\nsingularities. We will assume that \u2212KX is an ample Q\u2013Cartier divisor and we will be\ninterested in showing that for some \u01eb > 0 and every effective Q\u2013divisor D \u2208 | \u2212 KX |, the\npair (X, 2+\u01eb\n3 D) is klt. In particular this is certainly true if the pair (X, D) is log\u2013canonical\nfor all choices of D. Checking whether or not (X, D) is log\u2013canonical will be intricate at\nsingular points of X and we begin by reducing this condition to a much simpler one on a\nsmooth finite cover of X.\nWe begin by noting that by [KM] Proposition 4.18, the variety X itself is klt at a\nsingular point x if and only if X has a quotient singularity at x. In order to check whether\nor not the pair (X, D) is klt at x we need to consider a local cover\n\u0001\n\u03c0 : C2 , 0 \u2192 (X, x),\n\nwhere the map \u03c0 is given by taking the quotient via a finite group action. We let U \u2282 C2\ndenote an open subset on which \u03c0 is defined and let\np:S\u2192U\n\n\u2217\nbe the blow\u2013up of U at 0 with exceptional divisor E. We will show that if (S, p\u22121\n\u2217 (\u03c0 D)+E)\nis log\u2013canonical near E then the pair (X, D) is log\u2013canonical at x. Shokurov's inversion of\n\u2217\nadjunction ([KM] Theorem 5.50) states that the pair (S, p\u22121\n\u2217 (\u03c0 D) + E) is log\u2013canonical\n\u2217\n1\nnear E if (E, p\u22121\n\u2217 \u03c0 (D)|E) is log\u2013canonical. But E \u2243 P and so this is an easy condition\n\u22121 \u2217\nto check, satisfied provided the round\u2013up of p\u2217 \u03c0 (D)|E is a sum of distinct points, each\nwith multiplicity one.\n\nBy [KM] Lemma 2.30 and Proposition 5.20.4 together with the inversion of adjunction,\none derives\n\u2217\nLemma 2.5: Suppose that mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2 and that (E, p\u22121\n\u2217 \u03c0 D + E) is log\u2013canonical.\nThen (X, D) is log\u2013canonical at x.\n\n11\n\n\f\u2217\nWe sketch here the details of Lemma 2.5.

For this, we\nconsider the commutative diagram\n\ng\n\u0582\n\nW\n\nh\n\u0581\n\nU\n\nX\u0303.\n\u0581\n\u03c0\n\n\u0582\nf\n\nX\n12\n\n\fWrite\n\u2217\n\nKW =g KU +\nKX\u0303 =f \u2217 KX +\n\ns\nX\n\nbj Gj ,\n\nj=1\nr\nX\n\nai Fi .\n\ni=1\n\nUsing the logarithmic ramification formula ([Ka] Lemma 1.6) we find\n!\nr\ns\nX\nX\n(1 + ai )Fi + R,\n(1 + bj )Gj = h\u2217\n2.8\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nwhere all divisorial components of R are contracted by h.

Let G denote a divisor on W such that h : G \u2192 F is finite,\nwith discrepancy \u03b2G . Then 2.10 says that \u03b1F \u2265 \u22121 provided \u03b2G \u2265 \u22121. But (U, \u03c0 \u2217 D) is\nlog\u2013canonical near E if and only if \u03b2j \u2265 \u22121 for all Gj contracted by g. Thus \u03b1F \u2265 \u22121 for\nall F contracted by f and this shows that (X, D) is log\u2013canonical at x.\nWe now give some general criteria for establishing whether or not (X, D) is log\u2013\ncanonical at a point x.\nLemma 2.11: Suppose X is a normal projective surface and D an effective Q\u2013divisor on\nX. Suppose moreover that x \u2208 Xreg . Then the pair (X, D) is klt at x provided A * D < a\nfor some divisor A such that the linear series |A \u2297 max | has only isolated base points.\nProof: Suppose x \u2208 supp(D). Choose a representative E \u2208 |A \u2297 max | such that E \u2229\nsupp(D) is proper. Then we have\nix (D, E) \u2264 D * E < a.\nOn the other hand\nix (D, E) \u2265 multx (D)multx (E) \u2265 a(multx (D)).\nThus we have\n\nmultx (D) < 1\n13\n\n\fand Lemma 2.11 follows from [KM] Theorem 4.5 (1).\nNote that Lemma 2.11 throws away a lot of information because the estimate\nD * E \u2265 ix (D, E)\ncan be very crude; to give a more precise estimate, however, requires information about\nthe specific geometry of X. We will also need a slight refinement of Lemma 2.11 to deal\nwith the singular points of X.\nLemma 2.12: Suppose X is a normal projective surface with a quotient singularity of index\nm at x. Suppose D is an effective Q\u2013divisor and A a divisor on X such that |A \u2297 max |\nhas only isolated base points for some positive integer a. Then (X, D) is klt at x provided\na\nA*D < m\n.\nProof: Choose a general divisor E \u2208 |A \u2297 max | so that E \u2229 D is proper. Choose a local\nresolution \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X of X at x with \u03c0 \u22121 (x) = y. Then\nmulty (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264\n\nmD * A\n.\na\n\nThus, by hypothesis multy (\u03c0 \u2217 D) < 1 so that (Y, \u03c0 \u2217D) is klt at y. By Lemma 2.11 this\nimplies that the pair (X, D) is klt at x.\n\n3. The Sasakian Geometry of Links of Weighted Homogeneous Polynomials\nIn this section we discuss the Sasakian geometry of links of isolated hypersurface\nsingularities defined by weighted homogeneous polynomials. Consider the affine space\nCn+1 together with a weighted C\u2217 -action given by (z0 , . . . , zn ) 7\u2192 (\u03bbw0 z0 , . . . , \u03bbwn zn ),\nwhere the weights wj are positive integers. It is convenient to view the weights as the\ncomponents of a vector w \u2208 (Z+ )n+1 , and we shall assume that they are ordered w0 \u2264\nw1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 wn and that gcd(w0 , . . . , wn ) = 1. Let f be a quasi-homogeneous polynomial,\nthat is f \u2208 C[z0 , . . . , zn ] and satisfies\n3.1\n\nf (\u03bbw0 z0 , . . . , \u03bbwn zn ) = \u03bbd f (z0 , . . . , zn ),\n\nwhere d \u2208 Z+ is the degree of f. We are interested in the weighted affine cone Cf defined\nby the equation f (z0 , . . . , zn ) = 0. We shall assume that the origin in Cn+1 is an isolated\nsingularity, in fact the only singularity, of f. Then the link Lf defined by\n3.2\n\nLf = Cf \u2229 S 2n+1 ,\n\nwhere\nS 2n+1 = {(z0 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 Cn+1 |\n14\n\nn\nX\nj=0\n\n|zj |2 = 1}\n\n\fis the unit sphere in Cn+1 , is a smooth manifold of dimension 2n \u2212 1. Furthermore, it is\nwell-known [Mil] that the link Lf is (n \u2212 2)-connected.\nOn S 2n+1 there is a well-known [YK] \"weighted\" Sasakian structure (\u03bew , \u03b7w , \u03a6w , gw )\nwhich in the standard coordinates {zj = xj + iyj }nj=0 on Cn+1 = R2n+2 is determined by\nPn\ni=0 (xi dyi \u2212 yi dxi )\n,\n\u03b7w = P\nn\n2\n2\ni=0 wi (xi + yi )\n\n\u03bew =\n\nn\nX\ni=0\n\nwi (xi \u2202yi \u2212 yi \u2202xi ),\n\nand the standard Sasakian structure (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) on S 2n+1 . The embedding Lf \u0592\u2192 S 2n+1\ninduces a Sasakian structure on Lf [BG3].\nGiven a sequence w = (w0 , . . . , wn ) of ordered positive integers one can form the\ngraded polynomial ring S(w) = C[z0 , . . . , zn ], where zi has grading or weight wi . The\nweighted projective space [Dol, Fle] P(w) = P(w0 , . . . , wn ) is defined to be the scheme\nProj(S(w)). It is the quotient space (Cn+1 \u2212 {0})/C\u2217 (w), where C\u2217 (w) is the weighted\naction defined in 3.1, or equivalently, P(w) is the quotient of the weighted Sasakian sphere\n2n+1\nSw\n= (S 2n+1 , \u03bew , \u03b7w , \u03a6w , gw ) by the weighted circle action S 1 (w) generated by \u03bew . As\nsuch P(w) is also a compact complex orbifold with an induced K\u00e4hler structure. We have\nfrom [BG3]\nTheorem 3.3: The quadruple (\u03bew , \u03b7w , \u03a6w , gw ) gives Lf a quasi-regular Sasakian structure\nsuch that there is a commutative diagram\nL\uf8e6f\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c0\ny\nZf\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n2n+1\nSw\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nP(w),\n\nwhere the horizontal arrows are Sasakian and K\u00e4hlerian embeddings, respectively, and the\nvertical arrows are principal S 1 V-bundles and orbifold Riemannian submersions. Moreover, Lf is the total space of the principal S 1 V-bundle over the orbifold Zf whose first\n2\n(Zf , Z) is c1 (Zf )/I, where I is the index.\nChern class in Horb\nWe should also mention that c1 (Zf ) pulls back to the basic first Chern class cB\n1 \u2208\n2\n\u2217\nHB\n(F\u03bew ) and \u03b7w is the connection in this V-bundle whose curvature is d\u03b7 = 2ni\n\u03c0\n\u03c9w ,\nI\nwhere \u03c9w is the K\u00e4hler form on Zf .\nNow conditions on the weights that guarantee that the hypersurface Cf \u2282 Cn+1\nhave only an isolated singularity at the origin are well-known [Fle,JK1]. These conditions\nbecome more complicated as the dimension increases [Fle,JK2]; however, in this paper\nwe will only be interested in the n = 3 case of hypersurfaces in a weighted complex\nprojective 3-space. These conditions, known as quasi-smoothness conditions gaurentee\nthat Zf is smooth in the orbifold sense, that is, at a vertex Pi \u2208 P(w) the preimage of Zf\nin the orbifold chart of P(w) is smooth. It is easy to see that one can formulate all these\nconditions as follows [Fle,JK1]:\n15\n\n\fQuasi-Smoothness Conditions 3.4:\nI.\n\nFor each i = 0, * * * , 3 there is a j and a monomial zimi zj \u2208 O(d).\nHere j = i is possible.\n\nII.\n\nIf gcd(wi , wj ) > 1 then there is a monomial zibi zj j \u2208 O(d).\n\nIII.\n\nFor every i, j either there is a monomial zibi zj j \u2208 O(d),\n\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nor there are monomials zici zj j zk and zidi zj j zl \u2208 O(d) with {k, l} =\n6 {i, j}.\nIn condition I the i = j case corresponds to the case when Zf does not pass through\nthe point Pi . The second condition is equivalent to Zf not containing any of the singular\nlines in P(w). If Zf contains a coordinate axis (say zj = zj = 0) then the condition III\nforces Zf to be smooth along it, except possibly at the vertices.\nThere is another condition apart from quasi-smoothness that assures us that the\nadjunction theory behaves correctly, and that P(w) does not have any orbifold singularities\nof codimension 1. It is [Dol,Fle]\nWell-formedness Condition 3.5\nIV.\n\nFor any triple i, j, k 6=, we have gcd(wi , wj , wk ) = 1.\n\nCondition IV guarantees that the canonical V-bundle KZ is determined in terms of\nthe degree and index by\n3.6\nwhere |w| =\n\nKZ \u2243 O(\u2212I) = O(d \u2212 |w|),\nP\n\ni\n\nwi .\n\nFinally we end this section by giving a corollary of Lemma 2.12 which, by Theorem\n1.23, gives sufficient conditions to ensure that Zf admits a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric.\nCorollary 3.7: Let Zf \u2282 P(w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ) be a hypersurface of degree d in weighted\nprojective space with w = (w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ) well-formed. Let \u2206 \u2208 | \u2212 \u03b1KZf | be an effective\nrepresentative for some rational \u03b1 > 0. Writing KZf = OZf (\u2212I), suppose x \u2208 Zf is a\npoint at which P(w) has a singularity of order lx . If BS(OZf (w0 ) \u2297 Ix ) does not contain\nany component of \u2206 then (Zf , \u2206) is klt at x provided\n\u03b1lx dI < w1 w2 w3 .\nIf BS(OZf (w0 w1 ) \u2297 Ix ) does not contain \u2206 then (Zf , \u2206) is klt at x provided\n\u03b1lx dI < w0 w2 w3 .\nIn general, unless Zf is the hypersurface {z0 = 0}, one always has that (Zf , \u2206) is klt at\nx if\n\u03b1lx dI < w0 w1 w3 .\n16\n\n\fProof: This corollary follows immediately from Lemma 2.12 by looking at the linear\nsystems |OZf (w0 )|, |OX (w0 w1 )|, and |OZf (w0 w1 w2 )| respectively. For example, taking\nA = |OZf (w0 w1 )| in Lemma 2.12, we find that we can take a = w0 since one of the\nsections z0w1 , z1w0 will not vanish along \u2206 by hypothesis and w0 \u2264 w1 . Then Lemma 2.12\nstates that (Zf , \u03b1\u2206) is klt at x provided A * \u03b1\u2206 < lwX0 . But\nA * \u03b1\u2206 =\n\nw0 w1 d\u03b1I\nd\u03b1I\n=\n.\nw0 w1 w2 w3\nw2 w3\n\nThe middle formula follows immediately and the others are obtained similarly.\n4. The Algebraic Equations and Their Solutions\nWe want to repeat the analysis of [JK1] for the case of an arbitrary index I. Following\ntheir approach we consider the linear system\n4.1\n\nmi wi + wj(i) = d = w0 + w1 + w2 + w3 \u2212 I\n\nwhere mi is a positive integer and both i and j(i) are integers ranging over 0, 1, 2, 3. Note\nwe can have j(i) = i. This is an obvious translation of the quasi-smoothness condition\n3.4.I\nLemma 4.2: Assuming conditions 3.4.I and 3.4.IV, the following bounds hold\n(1) 1 \u2264 m3 \u2264 2.\n(2) Either 2 \u2264 m2 \u2264 4, or 2w0 \u2264 I.\n(3) Either 2 \u2264 m1 \u2264 10, or 2I = w0 + w1 , or 2I \u2265 3w0 , or condition 3.4.II is violated.\nProof: Since the weights are ordered w0 \u2264 w1 \u2264 w2 \u2264 w3 , (1) follows immediately from\nthe linear system with i = 3. To prove (2) we consider i = 1 in the system 4.1. There are\ntwo cases: wj(2) = w3 and wj(2) 6= w3 . If wj(2) = w3 we immediately have\nm2 w2 = w0 + w1 + w2 \u2212 I \u2264 3w2 \u2212 I\nwhich implies m2 \u2264 2.\nNow consider wj(2) 6= w3 , then there are two subcases depending on whether m3 = 2\nor 1. If m3 = 2 our system gives\nw0 + w1 + w2 = w3 + wj(3) + I,\nand here there are two subcases giving:\n1. If wj(3) = w3 , then 2w3 < 3w2 .\n17\n\n\f2. If wj(3) 6= w3 , then w3 < 2w2 ,\nand in both cases we have w3 < 2w2 . Thus since wj(2) 6= w3 , we get\nm2 w2 \u2264 2w2 + w3 \u2212 I < 4w2 \u2212 I\nimplying m2 \u2264 3.\nFinally we consider the case m3 = 1. Here we obtain\n4.3\n\nwj(3) + I = w0 + w1 + w2 .\n\nIf w3 = wj(3) = w0 + w1 + w2 \u2212 I, then d = 2w3 , so m2 w2 + wj(2) = 2w0 + 2w1 + 2w2 \u2212 2I.\nThis gives\nm2 w2 \u2264 5w2 \u2212 2I,\nimplying that m2 \u2264 4, whereas if wj(3) 6= w3 , then we have I = wi + wj for some distinct\ni, j = 0, 1, 2. We have thus shown that either 1 \u2264 m2 \u2264 4 or I = wi + wj for some distinct\ni, j = 0, 1, 2. It is now easy to see that if m2 = 1 then we must have 2w0 \u2264 I. Thus, in all\ncases (2) of the lemma holds.\nFinally we consider (3). We proceed along the lines of (2). If possible we solve the\nsystem 4.1 for i = 2, 3 for w3 and w2 ; however, there are exceptional cases, that is, values\nof m3 and m2 such w3 and/or w2 are free. We shall show that in these cases when m1\nis unbounded that either 2I \u2265 3w0 , or 2I = w0 + w1 , or condition 3.4.II is violated.\nMoreover, when we can solve for w2 and w3 and substitute into 4.1 with i = 1 we obtain\nan equation for m1 in terms of m2 , m3 , w1 , w2 , w3 . This gives a bound for m1 which is\ncertainly maximal for I = 1 (in fact for I = 0) and one can see that m1 \u2264 10 as in [JK].\nTo see the lower bound on m1 we show that if m1 = 1 then I \u2265 2w0 . There are two\ncases to consider, wj(1) = w1 and wj(1) 6= w1 , and one easily sees that both cases give the\ndesired estimate.\nWe now consider the exceptional cases. For the i = 3 equation of the system 4.1 this\noccurs for m3 = 1, and one easily sees that there are 3 exceptional cases all which imply\nthe estimate I \u2265 2w0 . Now assuming that w3 is determined in terms of the remaining\nweights and index, we consider the i = 2 equation in 4.1. There are 4 subcases. Since\nm2 > 1 the case wj(2) = w3 gives no exceptional solution. Now if wj(2) = w2 we have\nm2 w2 = w0 + w1 + w3 \u2212 I and we must plug in the possibilities for w3 determined by the\ni = 3 equation. But since all of these possibilities are of the form w3 = aw2 + b with a = 0,\na = 21 or a = 1, we see that there are no exceptional solutions in this case either.\nNext we put wj(2) = w1 , and consider the 5 possibilities for w3 . The first is w3 = w0 +\nw1 + w2 \u2212 I, and this leads to the exceptional case with m2 = 2 and 2I = 2w0 + w1 \u2265 3w0 .\nThe next case with 2w3 = w0 + w1 + w2 \u2212 I is not exceptional, and the third with\nw3 = w0 + w1 \u2212 I again gives 2I \u2265 3w0 . The fourth case w3 = w0 + w2 \u2212 I, however, gives\nthe exceptional case m2 = 2 and I = w0 , and this requires a bit more analysis. Here we\nhave that w3 = w2 and so the weights are (I, w1 , w2 , w2 ) with degree d = 2w2 + w1 . But\nthis fails the quasi-smoothness condition (2) of section 3 the w2 must divide d, and this\ncan occur only if w2 = w1 which violates the well-formedness condition. Finally the fifth\nsubcase with w3 = w1 + w2 \u2212 I leads to m2 = 2 and 2I = w0 + w1 .\n18\n\n\fFinally we have the case wj(2) = w0 . The first possibility for w3 gives an exceptional\ncase with 2I \u2265 3w0 , while the next two do not lead to any exceptional cases. Subcase\n4, however, with w3 = w0 + w2 \u2212 I give m2 = 2 and 2I = w0 + w1 . This implies the\ninequalities w0 \u2264 I \u2264 w1 and the equation w3 = w2 \u2212 w1 + I which violate the order\nw2 \u2264 w3 unless w3 = w2 and I = w1 = w0 . But in this case the degree is d = 2w2 + I,\nand condition 3.4.II then implies that w2 = w3 = I which contradicts the well-formedness\ncondition 3.4.IV. The last possibility for w3 is w3 = w1 + w2 \u2212 I and this leads to the\nexceptional case m2 = 2 and I = w1 . But then we have w3 = w2 and d = 2w2 + w0 which\nviolates condition 3.4.II above again since w2 cannot divide w0 .\nRemarks 4.4: There are solutions with arbitrary m1 that are quasi-smooth, but our\nlemma implies that these must satisfy 2I \u2265 3w0 or 2I = w0 + w1 . As we shall see in\nthe next section, in both cases the sufficient condition for the existence of a K\u00e4hlerEinstein metric fails. Examples of such a series are: (1, 1, k, k) of degree 2k and index 2,\n(1, 2, 2k + 1, 2k + 1) of degree 2(2k + 1) and index 3, and (2, 2, 2k + 1, 2k + 1) of degree\n2(2k+1) and index 4, as well as the general series (I \u2212n, I +n, w, w+n) of degree 2w+n+I\nand index I. There are also double series such as (1, 1, m, m + k) of degree 2m + k and\nindex 2.\nWe have modified the computer program of [JK1] to solve the system 4.1 for any index\nI as well as to discard some solutions that are not quasi-smooth.

In all such cases techniques\nof [DK] say nothing about the corresponding Zw . Table 2 below gives the classical examples\nof Zw that can be written as smooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces and which\nby other methods admit K-E metrics [TY]. We only indicate a particular polynomial as\nthe most general such hypersurface involves many such monomials which for reasons of\nspace we do not include.

Proof of Theorem 4.5\n\nThe proof goes as follows: we begin by proving two lemmas which by Lemma 4.2\nwill reduce the problem to one in which the integers m2 and m1 of 4.1 are bounded. The\ncomputer programs then give a printout of solutions of 4.1 which give all log del Pezzo\norbifolds Zw such that (Zw , D) might be klt for all D \u2261 \u2212 2+\u01eb\n3 KZw . In the case that m0\nis unbounded, these are the series solutions, and the case when m0 is bounded, they are\nthe sporadic solutions. Corollary 3.7 is sufficient, for most of the sporatic solutions, to\nKZw . However, for the series solutions the klt\ncheck that (Zw , D) is klt for all D \u2261 \u2212 2+\u01eb\n3\ncondition is much more tedious. Indeed, in several cases we are unable to give an answer.\nThe results are collected in tables. In the last column of the tables we indicate whether\nthe klt condition holds (Y) or is unknown (?). Since there exists a K\u00e4hler-Einstein orbifold\nKZw , this column is labeled K-E. The\nmetric whenever (Zw , D) is klt for all D \u2261 \u2212 2+\u01eb\n3\nsecond to the last column gives the second Betti number of Zw which is computed by the\nmethod described in section 6. Also, where space permits, we give the monomials that\nmake up the defining weighted homogeneous polynomial. This is indicated in the tables\nfor most of the sporadic solutions.\nLemma 5.1: Suppose 2I \u2265 3w0 . Then for any \u01eb > 0, there exists D \u2208 | \u2212 KZw | such that\n(Zw , 2+\u01eb\n3 D) is not klt.\nProof: Consider the section z0 \u2208 H 0 (Zw , OZw (w0 )) and let D be its zero divisor. Then\nby hypothesis rD \u2208 |OZw (\u2212KZw )| for r \u2265 23 . But then 2+\u01eb\n3 D can never be klt at a generic\npoint y \u2208 D, for \u01eb > 0, since it has multiplicity greater than 1.\n23\n\n\fLemma 5.2: Suppose Zw \u2282 P(w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ) is a hypersurface of index I with 2I =\nw0 + w1 . Then for any \u01eb > 0, there exists D \u2208 | \u2212 KZw | such that (Zw , 2+\u01eb\n3 D) is not klt.\nProof: First we notice in the proof of Lemma 4.2 that 2I = w0 + w1 occurs in precisely\none case and in this case we have w3 = w1 + w2 \u2212 I. But then w must have the form\nw = (I \u2212 n, I + n, w, w + n)\nfor some w \u2208 Z+ with w \u2265 I + n, and some non-negative integer n < I and in this case\nthe degree d = 2w + n + I. Now suppose that z0a0 z1a1 z2a2 z3a3 is a monomial occurring with\nnonzero coefficient in the polynomial defining Zw . We claim that if a0 = 0 then a1 6= 0.\nIndeed, if a0 = a1 = 0 then\na2 w + a3 w = 2w + 2I + n.\nBut w \u2265 I + n so the only possible solutions would require a2 + a3 = 3 and w = 2I + n and\none readily checks that these hypersurfaces are never quasi-smooth. Thus the divisor D =\n{z0 = 0} \u2229 Zw has at least two components, E and F, where E is the line z0 = z1 = 0 and\nF is defined, inside the weighted projective plane {z0 = 0}, by a polynomial f (z1 , z2 , z3 ).\nMoreover, f (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z22 + z12 (g(z1 , z2 , z3 )). Note that the point P = (0, 0, 0, 1) \u2208 Zw\nsince w + n does not divide the degree of Zw . Thus if \u03c0 : C2 \u2212\u2212\n\u2192Zw is a local cover of\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe quotient singularity at P = (0, 0, 0, 1) then \u03c0 D = \u03c0 E + \u03c0 \u2217 F has multiplicity at\nleast 1 + mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 F ) at the origin. To compute the multiplicity of \u03c0 \u2217 F at the origin, let\nY = Z(f (z1 , z2 , z3 )). Then Y \u2229Zw = F \u222aG, where G does not contain the point (0, 0, 0, 1).\nThus\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 F ) = mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 Z(f )) \u2265 2.\nConsequently, (Zw , 2+\u01eb\n3 D) is never klt as it always has multiplicity > 2 at 0. But\n| \u2212 KZw | so this completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nI\nI\u2212n D\n\n\u2208\n\nThe analysis of most of the sporadic examples of Table 1 is easily done with help of\nCorollary 3.7 which can restated for this purpose as:\nCorollary 5.3: Let w = (w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ) and Zw \u2282 P(w) be a quasi-smooth surface\nof degree d = w0 + w1 + w2 + w3 \u2212 I. Then Zw admits a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric if\n2Id < 3w0 w1 . If the line (z0 = z1 = 0) 6\u2282 Zw then 2Id < 3w0 w2 is also sufficient. If the\npoint (0, 0, 0, 1) 6\u2208 Zw then 2Id < 3w0 w3 is also sufficient.\nWe begin with the more complicated analysis of the infinite series examples. In\nwhat follows P will frequently denote the appropriate weighted projective space, with the\nweights w being understood; similarly Zw \u2282 P will denote a hypersurface in the weighted\nprojective space, depending on an integer parameter k for all of the series examples.\n\u2022 We consider now the hypersurface Zw \u2282 P(4, 2k + 1, 2k + 1, 4k) given by the zero set of\nthe homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 8k + 4\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z02k+1 + z0 z32 + g(z1 , z2 ),\nwhere g is of degree 4 and we assume that the polynomial g has 4 distinct roots on the\nprojective line. Thus \u2212KZw = OZw (2). The only singularities of Zw lie at the singular\n24\n\n\fpoints of P(w). We can apply Corollary 3.7 to see that (Zw , D) is klt at all smooth points\nof P(w), for all k > 0, for all D \u2261 \u2212KZw since\nd * \u03ba = (8k + 4)2 < 4(2k + 1)(2k + 1).\nWe now pass to the singular points of Zw which are slightly more involved as we need\nto consider a desingularization. We first treat the point P = (0, 0, 0, 1). We would like to\napply the preceding discussion and use Shokurov's inversion of adjunction (Lemma 2.5) for\nwhich we need to verify that mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2 for any effective Q\u2013divisor D \u2261 \u2212KZw : here\n\u03c0 : (C2 , 0) \u2192 (Zw , P ) is a local cover of the quotient singularity at P . We will consider\nthe linear series |z1 , z2 | on Zw . This has only isolated base points on Zw , including the\npoint P in question, and consequently if E is a general member of this system then D \u2229 E\nwill be proper. Pulling back to C2 to compute the intersection multiplicity at 0 we find,\nsince the ramification of \u03c0 over P is of degree 4k,\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 4kD * E =\n\n2(2k + 1)(8k + 4)4k\n= 2,\n4(2k + 1)2 4k\n\nand thus we may apply Lemma 2.5. Hence it is sufficient, in order to establish that (Zw , D)\nis log\u2013canonical at P , to show that\n\u2217\np\u22121\n\u2217 (\u03c0 D)|E\n\nis a sum of points each with coefficient at most one.\nConsider the hypersurface z0 = 0 on Zw . This is a union of four lines, L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 ,\none for each (projective) zero of the polynomial g(z1 , z2 ). Thus we have\n5.4\n\nL1 + L2 + L3 + L4 \u2208 |OZw (4)|.\n\nNote that if an effective divisor D \u2261 \u2212KZw does not contain any of the lines Li , then\ncomputing (L1 + L2 + L3 + L4 )D will immediately establish that (Zw , D) is klt at P . Thus\nthe representatives of \u2212KZw which are of concern are those containing some or all of the\nlines Li . So suppose\n5.5\n\nD \u2261 a 1 L1 + a 2 L2 + a 3 L3 + a 4 L4 + D \u2032 ,\n\nwhere D\u2032 meets each of the four lines properly. We are interested in bounding the ai which\ncan be accomplished intersection theoretically. In particular we compute\n5.6\n\nLi * Lj =\n\n1\n4k\n\nfor\n\ni 6= j.\n\nTo see this, note that the four lines Li are algebraically equivalent. Thus, using 5.4 above\ngives\n\n5.7\n\nZw * OP (4) * OP (2k + 1) = 4(Li * OP (2k + 1))\n25\n\nfor all i.\n\n\f1\nThe left hand side of 5.7 is 4(8k+4)(2k+1)\n4(2k+1)2 4k = k . On the other hand one can check, choosing\nthe appropriate representative for OP (2k + 1) that OP (2k + 1) * Zw = Lj + C, where C\ndoes not meet Li ; 5.6 follows immediately.\n\nIntersecting 5.4 with OP (1) gives\n5.8\n\nOP (1) * Li =\n\n1\n,\n4(2k + 1)k\n\n\u2200 i.\n\nUsing 5.6 and 5.8 we can compute L2i :\nL2i = Li * OP (4) \u2212\n\n5.9\n\nX\nj6=i\n\nLi * Lj =\n\n1 \u2212 6k\n.\n(2k + 1)4k\n\nWe have, by 5.8\n5.10\n\nD * Li =\n\n1\n.\n2k(2k + 1)\n\nUsing 5.5 we obtain from 5.10\n5.11\n\nai L2i +\n\nX\nj6=i\n\n1\n.\n2k(2k + 1)\n\na j Lj * Li + D \u2032 * Li =\n\nTo compute the terms in 5.11 observe first that\nthat mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2. Next, note that\n\nP4\n\nD\u2032 * Li \u2264 D * D = OZw (2) * OZw (2) =\n\ni=1\n\nai \u2264 2; this follows from the fact\n\n4(8k + 4)\n1\n=\n.\n4(2k + 1)2 4k\nk(2k + 1)\n\nFinally, using 5.6 and 5.9, 5.11 becomes\n1\n1 X\n1\nai (1 \u2212 6k)\naj +\n+\n\u2265\n.\n(2k + 1)4k 4k\nk(2k + 1)\n2k(2k + 1)\nj6=i\n\nClearing denominators then yields\nai \u2264\n\nk+1\n.\n2k\n\nThus if k \u2265 2 we have ai \u2264 43 .\nNext we bound mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D\u2032 ). Since Li \u2229 D\u2032 is proper for any i we compute, using 5.8\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D\u2032 ) \u2264 4kLi * D \u2264\n26\n\n2\n.\n2k + 1\n\n\f\u2217\nReturning to the inversion of adjunction set\u2013up, we see that p\u22121\n\u2217 (\u03c0 (D)) is a sum of four\npoints (corresponding to the pull\u2013backs of the four of the lines Li ) having total multiplicity\n2\n. A simple computation then\nat most 34 and another divisor with total degree at most 2k+1\n11\nshows that 13 D is klt at P = (0, 0, 0, 1) for any D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\n\nNext we turn to the points Pi = (0, ai, bi , 0) on Zw ; there are exactly four of these by\nour assumption on the homogeneous polynomial f (z1 , z2 ) and the singularities have index\n2k + 1. Since BS(OZw (w0 w1 w2 ) \u2297 IPi ) is a finite set of points, we will apply Lemma 2.12\nwith A = OP (8k + 4). Then we have\nA*D =\n\n(8k + 4)(2)(8k + 4)\n2\n= .\n4(2k + 1)(2k + 1)4k\nk\n\nWe can take a = 4 in Lemma 2.12 since the linear series OP (8k + 4) allows for an isolated\nzero at Pi of multiplicity 4. Thus for k \u2265 2 we see that (Zw , 34 D) is klt at Pi .\nFinally, we deal with the points Qj = (aj , 0, 0, bj ), where the quotient singularities\nare of index 4. We again apply Lemma 2.12, this time taking A = OP (2k + 1). This\nlinear series has sections with an isolated singularity of multiplicity 1 at any of the Qj .\nWe compute\n1\n2(2k + 1)(8k + 4)\n=\nA*D =\n2\n4(2k + 1) 4k\n2k\nThus for k \u2265 2 we see that (Zw , 34 D) is klt at Qj . Putting together all of our computations\nestablishes that (Zw , 43 D) is klt for k \u2265 2 and for any D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\n\u2022 We consider now the hypersurface Zw \u2282 P(3, 3k + 1, 6k + 1, 9k + 3) given by the zero\nset of the homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 18k + 6\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z06k+2 + z13 z3 + z23 z0 + z32 .\nHere \u2212KZw = OZw (2). The worst singularity in this case is at x = (0, 0, 1, 0), where the\nindex is 6k + 1. Since BS(OZw (w0 w1 ) \u2297 Ix ) consists of finitely many points, Corollary 3.7\nsays that (Zw , 57 D) is klt at x for k \u2265 1 for any D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\nNext we consider the singular line z0 = z2 = 0, where the index is 3k + 1. This\nintersects Zw in the finitely many points. Applying the third formula of Corollary 3.7\nshows that (Zw , 75 D) is klt at each of these points for k \u2265 1.\nFinally, there are index 3 singularities along the line z1 = z2 = 0 which again intersects\nZw in finitely many points. Applying Corollary 3.7 to these shows that (Zw , 87 D) is klt\nat these points for k \u2265 1. Putting everything together we see that (Zw , 57 D) is klt for any\nD \u2261 \u2212KZw provided k \u2265 1.\n27\n\n\f\u2022 Next we consider the hypersurface Zw \u2282 P(6, 6k + 5, 12k + 8, 18k + 15) given by the zero\nset of the homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 36k + 30\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z06k+5 + z16 + z13 z3 + z0 z23 + z32 .\nHere we have OZw (\u2212KZw ) = OZw (4). This variety contains fewer of the singular points\nof P than the previous example and asymptotically in k, the proportions of these weights\nare identical and thus this also must be \u03b1-klt for all k sufficiently large and for appropriate\n\u03b1. More specifically, we must deal with one point at infinity, x = (0, 0, 1, 0) which has\nindex 12k + 8. Using OZw (6(6k + 5)) in Corollary 3.7 we see that (Zw , 75 D) is klt at x.\nNext there is the line z0 = z2 = 0, where the index of P is 6k + 5. Applying Corollary\n3.7 as above gives (Zw , 57 D) klt for k \u2265 1. Finally, there are is the line z1 = z2 = 0 of\nindex 3. It follows once more from Corollary 3.7 that (Zw , 87 D) is klt at each of these\npoints for all k \u2265 2. There are singularities of index 2 along the line z1 = z3 = 0; (Zw , D)\nis klt at these points for all k \u2265 1. Thus we find that for all k \u2265 2, (Zw , 75 D) is klt for any\nD \u2261 \u2212KZw .\n\u2022 Next we consider the hypersurface Zw = P(3, 3k + 1, 3k + 2, 3k + 2) given by the zero\nset of the homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 9k + 6\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z03k+2 + z0 z13 + g(z2 , z3 ),\nwhere g is a homogeneous polynomial of degree three with distinct zeroes. The only\nsingular points to be analyzed in this case are (0, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, ai, bi ), where (ai , bi )\nare the zeroes of g. We first examine P = (0, 1, 0, 0), where P has a singularity of index\n3k + 1. Let \u03c0 : (C2 , 0) \u2192 (Zw , P ) be a local cover and let D \u2261 \u2212KZw . Intersecting D\nwith a general member of OZw (3k + 2) establishes that\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2\nso that we can apply Shokurov's inversion of adjunction as before. As before we write\nL1 + L2 + L3 for the zero scheme of z0 on Zw . We compute\nLi * Lj =\n\n1\n,\n3k + 1\n\ni 6= j,\n\n1\n,\n(3k + 1)(3k + 2)\n\u22121 \u2212 6k\nL2i =\n(3k + 1)(3k + 2).\n\nOP (1) * Li =\n\nFor D \u2261 \u2212KZw effective we write D = a1 L1 + a2 L2 + a3 L3 + D\u2032 as before, with D\u2032\nmeeting the three lines properly, and we find, expanding D * Li and using the estimates\nD * D\u2032 \u2264 D * D, a1 + a2 + a3 \u2264 2\nai \u2212 2\n2\n(6k + 1)ai\n+\n\u2264\n.\n(3k + 1)(3k + 2) 3k + 1\n(3k + 1)(3k + 2)\n28\n\n\fExpanding yields ai \u2264\n\n6k+6\n9k+3 .\n\nMoreover, intersecting with z0 = 0 shows that\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D\u2032 ) \u2264\n\n2\n.\n3(3k + 2)\n\n6k+6\n\u2217\nThus, with notation as before, p\u22121\n\u2217 \u03c0 D is a sum of points with multiplicity at most 9k+3 +\n2\nand inversion of adjunction applies to show that (Zw , 34 D) is klt at P for all k \u2265 1.\n3(3k+2)\n\nThe other singular points of Zw like along the line z0 = z1 = 0 and these have index\n3k + 2. Let Qi = (0, 0, ai, bi ) \u2208 Zw be one of these three points. The analysis of D above\nfor P = (0, 1, 0, 0) applies at these points as well, unchanged though exactly one of the\nlines Li passes through Qi . In order to justify the use of Lemma 2.5 we need to show that\nmult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2 for a local cover of P at Qi . This can be done with Lemma 2.12 using\nthe linear series OZw (3(3k + 1)) allowing for a singularity of multiplicity 3 at Qi . Thus\nwe conclude that (Zw , 43 D) is klt for all k \u2265 1 and for all D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\n\u2022 Next we consider the hypersurface Zw \u2282 P(6, 6k + 3, 6k + 5, 6k + 5) given by the zero\nset of the homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 18k + 15\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z0 z13 + z02k+2 z1 + g(z2 , z3 ),\nwhere again g is homogeneous of degree 3 and Zw . This passes through two points at\ninfinity (1, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0, 0) and also intersects the singular lines z0 = z1 = 0 and\nz2 = z3 = 0 in finitely many points. The analysis of (0, 1, 0, 0) and (0, 0, ai, bi ) is identical\nto the prior case, yielding (Zw , 57 D) is klt at these points for all k \u2265 1. For the points\nalong the line z2 = z3 = 0, other than (0, 1, 0, 0),the index does not depend on k, and\nhence these are certainly klt for k sufficiently large; more specifically, (Zw , 75 D) is also klt\nat these points for k \u2265 2. Hence (Zw , 75 D) is klt for all k \u2265 2 and for all D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\n\u2022 Lastly we consider the hypersurface Zw \u2282 P(3, 3k, 3k + 1, 3k + 1) given by the zero set\nof the homogeneous polynomial of degree d = 9k + 3\nfw (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z03k+1 + z0 z13 + g(z2 , z3 ),\nwhere g is homogeneous of degree 3. This contains only one singular point at infinity\n(0, 1, 0, 0) as well as the points (0, 0, ai, bi ) and the points (ci , di , 0, 0). Routine computations exactly as above show that (Zw , 34 D) is klt for k \u2265 2 and for all D \u2261 \u2212KZw .\nRemark 5.12: Let us make a few comments for the series which we have not analyzed.\nFor the two series of index 6, the simple intersection theoretic argument which establishes\nthat mult0 (\u03c0 \u2217 D) \u2264 2 on a local cover of one of the singular points, where D \u2261 \u2212KZw ,\nfails. The desired bound may well still hold but more detailed analysis of the other points\nof intersection of D and the appropriate divisor of Corollary 3.7 would be necessary to\nestablish this. In the other cases which we have not analyzed, the singularities of \"bad\"\ndivisor D = {z0 = 0}\u2229Zw require more subtle analysis because in these cases the remaining\n29\n\n\fthree weights are distinct and hence it is more difficult to compute the contribution of D\nto the tangent cone at the origin of the appropriate local cover; when two of the remaining\nthree weights are the same, one quickly reduces to P(1, 1, k) which is singular only at\n(0, 0, 1) and it is easy to check which tangent directions D gives on the resolution. In\nprincipal, however, each of these cases could be decided with more involved computation.\n6. The Topology of the Link Lf\nRecall the well-known construction of Milnor [Mil] for isolated hypersurface singularities: There is a fibration of (S 2n+1 \u2212 Lf )\u2212\u2212\u2192S 1 whose fiber F is an open manifold that\nis homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of n-spheres S n \u2228 S n * * * \u2228 S n . The Milnor number\n\u03bc of Lf is the number of S n 's in the bouquet. It is an invariant of the link which can\nbe calculated explicitly in terms of the degree d and weights (w0 , . . . , wn ) by the formula\n[MO]\n6.1\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc(Lf ) =\n\nn\nY\n\u0001\nd\n\u22121 .\nwi\ni=0\n\nThe closure F\u0304 of F is a manifold with boundary that is homotopy equivalent to F, and\nwhose boundary is precisely the link Lf . Then the topology of Lf is determined by the\n1\nmonodromy map induced by the Sw\naction. Milnor and Orlik [MO] use these facts to give\nan algorithm for computing the Betti number bn\u22121 (Lf ) from the characteristic polynomial\n\u2206(t) of the monodromy map. The procedure is this. Associate to any monic polynomial\nf with roots \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k \u2208 C\u2217 its divisor\n6.2\n\ndiv f =< \u03b11 > + * * * + < \u03b1k >\n\nas an element of the integral ring Z[C\u2217 ] and let \u039bn = div(tn \u2212 1). The 'rational weights'\nused in [MO] are just wdi , and are written in irreducible form, wdi = uvii . The divisor of the\ncharacteristic polynomial is then determined by\n6.3.\n\ndiv \u2206(t) =\n\nY \u039bu\nX\n( i \u2212 1) = 1 +\naj \u039bj ,\nvi\ni\n\nwhere aj \u2208 Z and the second equality is obtained by using the relations \u039ba \u039bb =\ngcd(a, b)\u039blcm(a,b) . The second Betti number of the link is then given by\n6.4\n\nb2 (Lf ) = 1 +\n\nX\n\naj .\n\nj\n\nFurthermore, the following proposition was proved in [BG3]:\nProposition 6.5: Let Lf be the link of an isolated singularity defined by a weighted\nhomogeneous polynomial f in four complex variables with weights w. Suppose further\nthat the weights w are well-formed, then Tor (H2 (Lf , Z)) = 0.\n30\n\n\fNow a well-known theorem of Smale [Sm] says that any simply connected compact 5manifold which is spin, and whose second homology group is torsion free, is diffeomorphic\nto S 5 #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) for some non-negative integer l. Furthermore, it is known [BG2,Mor]\nthat any simply connected Sasakian-Einstein manifold is spin. Combining this with the\ndevelopment above gives\nTheorem 6.6: Let Lf be the link associated to a well-formed weighted homogeneous\npolynomial f in four complex variables. Suppose also that Lf is spin, in particular, if Lf\nadmits an Sasakian-Einstein\nmetric. Then Lf is diffeomorphic to S 5 #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ), where\nP\nl = b2 (Lf ) = 1 + j aj .\n7. The Moduli Problem for Sasakian-Einstein 5-Manifolds\n\nIn this section we discuss the moduli problem for Sasakian-Einstein manifolds. It\nis not our intention here to discuss the general moduli problem for Sasakian-Einstein\nstructures, but rather to present some results regarding the 5 dimensional non-regular\nexamples described in the previous sections together with the known regular SasakianEinstein 5-manifolds. In what follows by moduli space we shall mean certain sets of objects\n(sections of vector bundles) modulo the action of the group of diffeomorphisms that are\ndiffeotopic to the identity. In the case of orbifolds diffeomorphism means diffeomorphism\nin the sense of orbifolds. Thus, in the case of complex moduli any two representatives are\ndeformation equivalent.\nWe begin by briefly discussing the case complex structures on the del Pezzo surfaces\nobtained by blowing up CP2 at l distinct points for 0 \u2264 l \u2264 8. We shall always assume\nthat no two of these points lie on a line nor any three lie on a conic which we refer to as\n2\nin general position. The complex structures on Zl = CP2 #lCP are then determined by\nthe complex coordinates of the l points modulo the action of the complex automorphism\ngroup G(Zl ). Since we can fix precisely four points in general position with the action of\nGL(3, C), the moduli space of complex structures MC\nl on Zl for l = 0, . . . , 4 is a single\npoint, whereas for l = 5, 6, 7, 8 it is an open connected manifold of complex dimension\n2(l \u2212 4).\nIt is known that when l > 2, there exists [Siu,TY,Ti1] a unique [BM], up to complex\nautomorphism, K\u00e4hler-Einstein structure associated to each complex structure. It follows\nthat in this case (l > 2) there is a 1-1 correspondence between the complex structures\non Zl and the homothety classes of positive K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics modulo complex\nautomorphisms. This gives the identification of moduli spaces\n7.1\n\nKE\nMC\n,\nl \u2243 Ml\n\nfor l > 2\n\nwhere MKE\ndenotes the moduli space of homothety classes of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on\nl\nZl . Moreover, when l = 1, 2 the space MKE\nis well-known to be empty, whereas, MC\nl\nl\n2\nKE\nis a single point space. Furthermore, for CP and CP1 \u00d7 CP1 both MC\nand\nM\nare\nl\nl\nsingle point spaces. When 4 < l < 9, it is possible that for two inequivalent complex\nstructures J1 , J2 \u2208 MC\nl the Einstein metrics g1 , g2 solving the corresponding MongeAmpere equations coincide. However, it follows from a theorem of Pontecorvo [Pon] that\nup to complex conjugation this can happen only when the metric is anti-self-dual, that is,\n31\n\n\fthe anti-self-dual part W+ of the Weyl conformal tensor must vanish. But it is well-known\n(cf. [Boy]) that a compact anti-self-dual K\u00e4hler surface has zero scalar curvature. So this\ncannot happen for del Pezzo surfaces. The precise result is given below in Proposition\n7.13, and the argument works equally well for compact K\u00e4hler orbifolds.\nIn the more general case of log del Pezzo surfaces Z that is complex compact surfaces with positive first Chern class and at most quotient singularities much less is known.\nHere we are dealing with K\u00e4hler orbifolds and as discussed earlier the existence problem\nof finding K\u00e4hler-Einstein orbifold metrics is still open. However, the Bando-Mabuchi\nuniqueness theorem carries over to the orbifold case, so when a positive K\u00e4hler-Einstein\norbifold metric exists it is unique up to homothety and complex automorphisms. Thus,\ngenerally, if MKE denotes the moduli space of homothety classes of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on Z, and MC denotes the moduli space of complex structures on Z, then there is an\ninjective map\n7.2\n\nMKE \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192MC .\n\nNext we relate the moduli of K\u00e4hler-Einstein structures on Z to the moduli of\nSasakian-Einstein structures on S. First we give a result in general dimension from our\nprevious work [BG1], and then specialize to dimension five.\nProposition 7.3: Two 2n + 1 dimensional rank one Sasakian structures S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g)\nand S \u2032 = (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03a6\u2032 , g \u2032 ) are equivalent if and only if their corresponding spaces of leaves\n(Z, \u03c9, J, h) and (Z \u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 , J \u2032 , h\u2032 ) are equivalent as K\u00e4hler orbifolds. Furthermore, S =\n(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is Sasakian-Einstein if and only if (Z, \u03c9, J, h) is K\u00e4hler-Einstein with scalar\ncurvature 4n(n + 1).\nRemark 7.4: Any Sasakian structure S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) has a canonically equivalent structure, namely the conjugate Sasakian structure S\u0304 = (\u2212\u03be, \u2212\u03b7, \u2212\u03a6, g). This corresponds on\nthe space of leaves to the complex conjugate K\u00e4hler structure, namely (Z, \u2212\u03c9, \u2212J, h).\nNotice that the correspondence in Proposition 7.4 is between rank one SasakianEinstein structures and K\u00e4hler-Einstein structures with a fixed scalar curvature, or equivalently homothety classes of K\u00e4hler-Einstein structures. Now there are two possible types\nof deformations of Sasakian-Einstein structures, those that deform the foliation and those\nthat do not. The latter all lie in one of the families F(\u03be) discussed in section 1, and the\nformer correspond to different base orbifolds Z (assuming both the original and deformed\nSasakian-Einstein structures are rank one). We believe that Sasakian-Einstein structures\nlying in different families F(\u03be) correspond to distinct components of the moduli space of\nSasakian-Einstein structures, but we do not prove this here.\nNow let us fix some notation. Let Sl = S 5 #l(S 2 \u00d7 S 3 ) denote by MSE\nthe moduli\nl\nreg,SE\n1,SE\nspace of Sasakian-Einstein structures on Sl , and let Ml\nand Ml\ndenote the moduli\nspace of regular Sasakian-Einstein structures, and rank one Sasakian-Einstein structures\non Sl , respectively. Then we have natural inclusions\n7.5\n\n\u2282 MSE\n\u2282 M1,SE\nMreg,SE\nl .\nl\nl\n\nCombining our discussion above with [FK,BG1,Ti1-Ti3] we obtain for the regular case:\n32\n\n\fProposition 7.6: The following hold:\n(i) Mreg,SE\nis not empty if and only if l = 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nl\n(ii) Mreg,SE\nis a single point when l = 0, 1, 3, 4.\nl\n(iii) Mreg,SE\nis a connected complex manifold of dimension 2(l \u2212 4) when l = 5, 6, 7, 8.\nl\nFurthermore, up to conjugation there is precisely one Sasakian structure sharing the\nsame Einstein metric g.\nTo analyze the moduli problem in the non-regular case, we begin by describing the\ngroup of complex automorphisms Gw of the weighted projective 3-space P(w). We shall\nassume that P(w) is well-formed. Recall that P(w) can be defined as a scheme Proj(S(w)),\nwhere\nM\nS(w) =\nS d (w) = C[z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ].\nd\n\nThe ring of polynomials C[z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ] is graded with grading defined by the weights\nw = (w1 , w1 , w2 , w3 ). As a projective variety we can embed P(w) \u2282 CPN and then the\ngroup Gw is a subgroup of P GL(N, C). P(w) is a toric variety and we can describe Gw\nexplicitly as follows: Let w = (w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ) be ordered as before. We consider the group\nG(w) of automorphisms of the graded ring S(w) defined on generators by\n\uf8eb (w0 )\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\nf0 (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 )\nz0\n\uf8ec (w )\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec z1 \uf8f7 \uf8ec f1 1 (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) \uf8f7\n\u03c6w \uf8ed \uf8f8 = \uf8ec (w2 )\n\uf8f7,\nz2\n\uf8ed f2 (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) \uf8f8\n(w )\nz3\nf 3 (z , z , z , z )\n\uf8eb\n\n7.7\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(w )\n\nwhere fi i (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) is an arbitrary weighted homogeneous polynomial of degree wi\nin (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ). This is a finite dimensional Lie group and it is a subgroup of GL(N, C).\nProjectivising, we get Gw = PC (G(w)).\nNote that when w = (1, 1, 1, 1) then G(w) = GL(4, C). Other than this case three\nweights are never the same if P(w) is well-formed. If two weights coincide then G(w)\ncontains GL(2, C) as a subgroup. Finally, when all weights are distinct we can write\n\n7.8\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\na0 z0\nz0\n(w )\n\uf8f7\na1 z1 + f1 0 (z1 )\n\uf8ec z1 \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\u03c6w \uf8ed \uf8f8 = \uf8ed\n(w2 )\na2 z2 + f2 (z0 , z1 ) \uf8f8\nz2\n(w )\nz3\na3 z3 + f3 3 (z0 , z1 , z2 )\n\uf8eb\n\n(w )\n\nwhere (a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ) \u2208 (C\u2217 )4 and fi i , i = 1, 2, 3 are weighted homogeneous polynomials\nof degree wi . The simplest situation occurs when f1 = f2 = f3 are forced to vanish. Then\nGw = (C\u2217 )3 is the smallest it can possibly be as P(w) is toric. This is, in fact, common\nto many examples of the log del Pezzo suraces of Table 1. More precisely, we have\n33\n\n\fLemma 7.9: Let w0 < w1 < w2 < w3 . If for each i = 1, 2, 3 the weight wi is not a Z+ -linear\ncombination of smaller weights with non-negative integer coefficients than Gw = (C\u2217 )3 .\nd\nLet Sw\n\u2282 S(w) be the vector subspace spanned by all monomials in (z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ) of\ndegree d = |w| \u2212 I, and let \u015c d (w) \u2282 S d (w) denote subset all quasi-smooth elements, i.e.\nd\nthose polynomials fw \u2208 Sw\nsuch that conditions 3.4 hold. Then we define mdw to be the\nd\ndimension of the subspace generated by \u015cw\n. Now the automorphism group G(w) acts on\nd\nd\nSw leaving the subset \u015c (w) of quasi-smooth polynomials invariant. Thus, for each log\ndel Pezzo surface that is a solution of Theorem 4.5 we define the moduli space\nd\nd\nMdw = \u015cw\n/G(w) = P(\u015cw\n)/Gw ,\n\n7.10\n\nwith ndw = dim(Mdw ). Now there is an injective map\nMdw \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192MC (Zw ),\n\n7.11\n\nand by our results of sections 4 and 5, each element in Mdw correponds to a unique\nhomothety class of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics modulo Gw and hence, to a unique SasakianEinstein structure on the corresponding 5-manifold Sl modulo the group Gw acting as CR\nautomorphisms. The results with non-trivial moduli are collected in Table 3 below.\nExample 7.12: As an illustration, we shall calculate the moduli spaces of complex structures of the three classical del Pezzo surfaces of Table 2. We begin with the cubic in\n3\nP(1, 1, 1, 1). The subset \u015c(1,1,1,1)\n\u2282 C20 is a dense open complex submanifold. In this case\nG(w) = GL(4, C) and the quotient M3(1,1,1,1) is a complex manifold of dimension 4. It is\nwell-known that in this case we have the identification Zf \u2243 Z6 so that M3(1,1,1,1) can be\nidentified with MC\n6.\nThe second example is a degree 4 surface in P(1, 1, 1, 2). Here \u015c 4 (1, 1, 1, 2) \u2282 C22 since\nthe general weighted polynomial f (z) of degree 4 can be written as the sum\nf (z) = g (4) (z0 , z1 , z2 ) + g (2) (z0 , z1 , z2 )z3 + \u03bbz32 .\nThe group G((1, 1, 1, 2)) is defined by\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\nz0\nz0\n\uf8f7\nA \uf8ed z1 \uf8f8\n\uf8ecz \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\u03c6w \uf8ed 1 \uf8f8 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nz2\nz2\n(2)\nz3\n\u03b1z3 + \u03c6 (z0 , z1 , z2 )\n\uf8eb\n\nA \u2208 GL(3, C), \u03b1 \u2208 C\u2217 ,\n\nwhere \u03c6(2) (z0 , z1 , z2 ) is an arbitrary homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in (z0 , z1 , z2 ).\nOne can see that the action is free and, hence, M4(1,1,1,2) is a complex manifold of dimension\nn4(1,1,1,2) = 6. It is known that the smooth member Zf \u2282 P(1, 1, 1, 2) is diffeomorphic to\nZ7 so that M4(1,1,1,2) can be identified with MC\n7.\n34\n\n\fThe third example is a degree 6 surface in P(1, 1, 2, 3). Here \u015c 6 (1, 1, 2, 3) \u2282 C23 as the\ngeneral weighted polynomial f (z) of degree 6 can be written as the sum\nf (z) = g (6) + g (4) z2 + g (2) z22 + \u03bb1 z23 + g (3) z3 + g (1) z2 z3 + \u03bb2 z32 ,\nwhere g (i) = g (p) (z0 , z1 ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree p = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The group\nG((1, 1, 2, 3)) in defined by\n\u0012 \u0013\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\nz0\nz0\nA\nz1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ecz \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\nA \u2208 GL(2, C), \u03b12 , \u03b13 \u2208 C\u2217 ,\n\u03c6w \uf8ed 1 \uf8f8 = \uf8ec\n(2)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nz2\n\u03b12 z2 + \u03c62 (z0 , z1 )\n(3)\n(1)\nz3\n\u03b13 z3 + \u03c63 (z0 , z1 ) + \u03c63 (z0 , z1 )z2\n(p)\n\nand \u03c6i , i = 1, 2, 3 are homogeneous polynomials in (z0 , z1 ) of degree p. One can see\nthat dim(G(1, 1, 2, 3)) = 15 and M6(1,1,2,3) is a connected complex manifold of dimension\nn6(1,1,2,3) = 8. Again, the general smooth member Zf \u2282 P(1, 1, 2, 3) is diffeomorphic to Z8\nso that M4(1,1,2,3) can be identified with MC\n8.\nOne can carry out similar calculations for any of the log del Pezzo surfaces. In Table\n1 below we tabulate all the examples of log del Pezzo surfaces of Theorem 4.5 which admit\nK\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics and for which ndw \u2265 1 and indicate the corresponding link Lf in\nS7 :\n\nIndex\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nTable 3.

As mentioned\npreviously for the log del Pezzo surfaces with a Y in the last column of Table 1 and\n35\n\n\fthe tables of Theorem 4.5, there is a unique homothety class of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics\ncorresponding to each point of Mdw . But the question remains whether two inequivalent\nK\u00e4hler-Einstein structures can share the same Riemannian metric. This is answered by a\nTheorem of Pontecorvo [Pon] which can be restated for our purposes as:\nProposition 7.13: Let (J, J \u2032 ) be two distinct log del Pezzo structures on the same underlying orbifold Z that are both compatible with the same Einstein metric g. Then J\nand J \u2032 are complex conjugates, i.e. J \u2032 = \u2212J.\nProof: By Proposition 3.1 of [Pon] if J \u2032 6= \u2212J then the metric g is anti-self-dual, i.e.\nW+ = 0. From [Boy] anti-self-dual K\u00e4hler metrics must have vanishing scalar curvature,\nand this cannot happen for log del Pezzo surfaces which are positive.\nConjugate K\u00e4hler-Einstein structures correspond to the same point of the moduli\nspace Mdw , so each point of Mdw corresponds to a distinct diffeomorphism class of K\u00e4hlerEinstein metrics with scalar curvature 4n(n + 1). There are similar results on the Sasakian\nlevel which are essentially due to Tanno [Tan] and Tachibana and Yu [TaYu]. We reformulate this result as follows:\nProposition 7.14: Let M be a (4n+1)-dimensional compact manifold. Let S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g)\nand S \u2032 = (\u03be \u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03a6\u2032 , g) be two distinct Sasakian structures on M sharing the same Riemannian metric g. Suppose further that (M, g) is not a sphere with the standard round Sasakian\nmetric. Then S \u2032 and S are conjugate Sasakian structures, i.e. S \u2032 = (\u2212\u03be, \u2212\u03b7, \u2212\u03a6, g).\nProof: Since (M, g) is not a round sphere, a theorem of Tachibana and Yu [TaYu] says\nthat g(\u03be, \u03be \u2032) is a constant, say a. By Schwarz inequality |a| \u2264 1 and since the Sasakian\nstructures are distinct we must have \u22121 \u2264 a < 1. If a = \u22121 then S and S \u2032 are conjugate\nSasakian structures. So assume |a| < 1, then following Tanno [Tan] we define\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03be \u2032 \u2212 a\u03be\n.\n\u03be =\u221a\n1 \u2212 a2\n\nNow we have\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ng(\u03be, \u03be ) = 0,\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ng(\u03be , \u03be ) = 1,\n\nand it follows from the characterization\nof Sasakian structures\u2032\u2032in terms of the Riemannian\n\u2032\u2032\ncurvature (cf. [BG2]) that \u03be defines a Sasakian structure S which is orthogonal to S.\nBut then this would define a 3-Sasakian structure [Tan] which cannot exist in dimension\n4n + 1. Thus, S and S \u2032 are conjugate Sasakian structures.\nNow combining Theorems 1.23, 4.5, 6.6, and Proposition 7.14 with the information\nin Tables 1 and 3 proves Theorem A of the Introduction.\n\nBibliography\n[AFHS] B.S.
