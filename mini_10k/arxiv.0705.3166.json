The device is realized by\nmonitoring the inelastic tunneling of electrons between the quantum dots due to photon absorption.\nThe frequency of the absorbed radiation is set by the energy separation between the dots, which is\neasily tuned with gate voltages. Using time-resolved charge detection techniques, we can directly\nrelate the detection of a tunneling electron to the absorption of a single photon.\n\nThe interplay between quantum optics and mesoscopic\nphysics opens up new horizons for investigating radiation\nproduced in nanoscale conductors [1, 2]. Microwave photons emitted from quantum conductors are predicted to\nshow non-classical behavior such as anti-bunching [3] and\nentanglement [4]. Experimental investigations of such\nsystems require sensitive, high-bandwidth detectors operating at microwave-frequency [5]. On-chip detection\nschemes, with the device and detector being strongly capacitively coupled, offer advantages in terms of sensitivity and large bandwidths. In previous work, the detection\nmechanism was implemented utilizing photon-assisted\ntunneling in a superconductor-insulator-superconductor\njunction [6, 7] or in a single quantum dot (QD) [8].\nAguado and Kouwenhoven proposed to use a double\nquantum dot (DQD) as a frequency-tunable quantum\nnoise detector [9]. The idea is sketched in Fig. 1(a),\nshowing the energy levels of the DQD together with a\nquantum point contact (QPC) acting as a noise source.\nThe DQD is operated with a fixed detuning \u03b4 between the\nelectrochemical potentials of the left and right QD. If the\nsystem absorbs an energy E = \u03b4 from the environment,\nthe electron in QD1 is excited to QD2. This electron\nmay leave to the drain lead, a new electron enters from\nthe source contact and the cycle can be repeated. The\nprocess induces a current flow through the system. Since\nthe detuning \u03b4 may be varied continuously by applying\nappropriate gate voltages, the absorbtion energy is fully\ntunable.\nThe scheme is experimentally challenging, due to low\ncurrent levels and fast relaxation processes between the\nQDs [10]. Here, we show that these problems can be\novercome by using time-resolved charge-detection techniques to detect single electrons tunneling into and out of\nthe DQD. Apart from giving higher sensitivity than conventional current measurement techniques, the method\nalso allows us to directly relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorbtion of a single photon. The system can thus be viewed as a frequency-selective single-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: simongus@phys.ethz.ch\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic for operating a double quantum dot\n(DQD) as a high-frequency noise detector.

This, together\nwith the fact that the charge-detection methods allow\nprecise determination of the device parameters, provide\nmajor advantages compared to other setups [2, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nThe sample [Fig. 1(b)] was fabricated by local oxidation [11] of a GaAs/Al0.3 Ga0.7 As heterostructure, containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 34 nm\nbelow the surface (mobility 3.5 \u00d7 105 cm2 /Vs, density\n4.6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 ). The sample also has a backgate\n1400 nm below the 2DEG, isolated by a layer of lowtemperature-grown (LT)-GaAs. The structure consists\nof two QDs in series (marked by 1 and 2 in the figure)\nwith a nearby QPC used as a charge detector (lower-right\ncorner of the figure). The dots are coupled via two separate tunneling barriers, formed in the upper and lower\narms between the QDs. For this experiment, only the\nupper arm was kept open, the lower one was pinched off.\nThe gates T, B, L and R are used to tune the height of\nthe tunneling barriers, while gates G1 and G2 control the\n\n\f35\n\n100\n\n34.5\n34\n\n-200\n\n10\n\nn,\nm+1\nn,m\n\nn+1,\nm+1\n\n1\n\n10\nRates [Hz]\n\nG2 [mV]\n\n35.5\n\n10\n10\n10\n\nn+1,m\n\n-7.5\n\n-7\n-6.5\nG1 [mV]\n\nDetuning [PeV]\n0\n\n2\n\n*\n\n1\n\n*\n\n-7\n-6.5\nG1 [mV]\n\nin\n\n-6\nCounts/s\n100\n\n34.6\n34.4\n\n10\n\n34.2\n34 V\n\nout\n\n0\n\n-7.5\n\n-6\n\n200\n\n3\n\n34.8\nG2 [mV]\n\nelectrochemical potentials of the two QDs.\nDue to electrostatic coupling between the QDs and the\nQPC, the conductance of the QPC is strongly influenced\nby the electron population of the QDs [12]. By voltage\nbiasing the QPC and continuously monitoring its conductance, electrons entering or leaving the QDs can be\ndetected in real-time [13, 14, 15]. The time resolution is\nlimited by the noise of the amplifier and the capacitance\nof the cables, giving our setup a bandwidth of a few kHz.\nOperating the QPC in a mode analogous to the radiofrequency single electron transistor [16] should make it\npossible to increase the bandwidth significantly.\nThe detection bandwidth puts an upper limit on the\ntransition rates that can be measured [17]. In the experiment, we tune the tunneling rates between the QDs\nand the source/drain leads to be around 1 kHz, while the\ncoupling t between the dots is kept at a relatively large\nvalue (t = 32 \u03bceV, corresponding to 7.7 GHz). The large\nintradot coupling enhances the probability for the photon absorbtion process sketched in Fig. 1(a), but it also\nmeans that intradot transitions will occur on a timescale\nmuch faster than what is detectable.\nFigure 1(c) shows a measurement of the count rate for\nelectrons entering the DQD versus voltages on gates G1\nand G2, with 600 \u03bcV bias applied between source (S) and\ndrain (D). Resonant tunneling of electrons between the\nDQD and the source and drain contacts give rise to lines\nforming a hexagon pattern. At the crossing points of\nthe lines, triangles with electron transport appear due to\nthe applied bias. These features are well-known characteristics of DQDs and allow precise determination of the\ncapacitances in the system [18]. The numbers in brackets denote the charge population of the two dots. Going\nfrom the region with population (n, m) to (n, m + 1), resonant tunneling occurs as QD2 aligns with the drain lead\n[marked by point I in Fig. 1(c)]. Between regions (n, m)\nand (n+1, m), the tunneling occurs between QD1 and the\nsource [point II]. Figure 1(d) displays time traces of the\nQPC current taken at point I (red) and point II (black),\nshowing a few events where electrons enter and leave the\nDQD. Since the QPC is located closer to QD2 than to\nQD1, electron fluctuations in QD2 give a larger change in\nthe QPC conductance than fluctuations in QD1. This enables us to do charge localization measurements [19, 20].\nBy analyzing the charge distribution as a function of detuning \u03b4, we extract the tunnel coupling energy between\nthe QDs to be t = 32 \u03bceV [19].\nIn the following, we present measurements taken with\nzero bias across the DQD. Fig. 2(a) shows count rates\nclose to the triple point where the (n + 1, m), (n, m + 1)\nand (n + 1, m + 1) states are degenerate [see inset of\nFig. 2(a)]. The arguments presented below are applicable also for the triple point between the (n, m), (n+1, m),\n(n, m + 1) states, but for simplicity we consider only the\nfirst case. At the triple point [marked by a blue dot in\nFig. 2(a)], the detuning \u03b4 is zero and both dots are aligned\nwith the Fermi level of the leads. The two strong, bright\nlines emerging from this point come from resonant tun-\n\nCounts/s\n\n2\n\nQPC\n\n=\n\n33.8 -100 P V\n-6.5\n-6\nG1 [mV]\n\nV\n\nQPC\n\n=\n\n-200 P V\n-6.5\n-6\nG1 [mV]\n\nV\n\nQPC\n\n=\n\n-300 P V\n-6.5\n-6\nG1 [mV]\n\nV\n\nQPC\n\n=\n\n1\n\n-400 P V\n-6.5\n-6\nG1 [mV]\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Electron count rates for a small region close to\na triple point (marked by a blue point).

The height of the lines gives directly the strength\nof the tunnel couplings [14, 21], and we find the rates to\nbe \u0393S = 1.2 kHz and \u0393D = 1.1 kHz.\nAlong the blue dashed line in Fig. 2(a), there are\ntriangle-shaped regions with low but non-zero count rates\nwhere tunneling is expected to be strongly suppressed\ndue to Coulomb blockade. The DQD level arrangement\ninside the triangles is shown in the insets. Comparing\nwith the sketch in Fig. 1(a), we see that both regions\nhave DQD configurations favorable for noise detection.\nThe dashed blue line connecting the triangles defines the\ndetuning axis, with zero detuning occuring at the triple\npoint. We take detuning to be negative in the upperleft part of the figure. In Fig. 2(b), the lower-right part\nof Fig. 2(a) was measured for four different QPC bias\nvoltages. The resonant line stays the same in all four\nmeasurements, but the triangle becomes both larger and\nmore prominent as the QPC bias is increased. This is a\nstrong indication that the tunneling is due to absorbtion\nof energy from the QPC.\nThe time-resolved measurement technique allows the\nrates for electron tunneling into and out of the DQD to be\ndetermined separately [22]. Figure 2(c) shows the rates\n\u0393in and \u0393out measured along the dashed line of Fig. 2(a).\nThe rate for tunneling out stays almost constant along\nthe line, but \u0393in is maximum close to the triple point\nand falls of rapidly with increased detuning. This suggests that only the rate for electrons tunneling into the\nDQD is related to the absorbtion process.

(b) Schematic\nchanges of the detector signal as electrons tunnel into, between and out of the DQD.\n\nrate-equation approach. For a configuration around the\ntriple point, the DQD may hold (n + 1, m), (n, m + 1) or\n(n + 1, m + 1) electrons. We label the states L, R and\n2 and draw the energy diagrams together with possible\ntransitions in Fig. 3(a). The figure shows the case for\npositive detuning, with \u03b4 \u226b kB T . Note that when the\nDQD holds two excess electrons, the energy levels are\nraised by the intradot charging energy, ECi = 800 \u03bceV.\nIn Fig 3(b) we sketch the time evolution of the system. The red curve shows the expected charge detector\nsignal assuming a detector bandwidth much larger than\nthe transitions rates. Starting in state L, the electron is\ntrapped until it absorbs a photon and is excited to state\nR (with rate \u0393abs. ). From here, the electron may either\nrelax back to state L (rate \u0393rel. ) or a new electron may\nenter QD1 from the source lead and put the system into\nstate 2 (rate \u0393S ). Finally, if the DQD ends up in state\n2, the only possible transition is for the electron in the\nright dot to leave to the drain lead.\nThe relaxation rate for a similar DQD system has been\nmeasured to be 1/\u0393rel. = 16 ns [23], which is much faster\nthan the available measurement bandwidth. Therefore,\nthe detector will not be able to register the transitions\nwhere the electron is repeatedly excited and relaxed between the dots. Only when a second electron enters from\nthe source lead [transition marked by \u0393S in Fig. 3(a, b)],\nthe DQD will be trapped in state 2 for a sufficiently long\ntime (\u223c 1/\u0393D \u223c 1 ms) to allow detection. The measured\ntime trace will only show two levels, as indicated by the\ndashed line in Fig. 3(b). Such a trace still allows extraction of the effective rates for electrons entering and\nleaving the DQD, \u0393in = 1/h\u03c4in i and \u0393out = 1/h\u03c4out i. To\nrelate \u0393in , \u0393out to the internal DQD transitions, we write\ndown the Master equation for the occupation probabilities of the states:\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\np\np\n\u2212\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\nL\nL\nabs.\nrel.\nD\nd \uf8ed\npR \uf8f8 = \uf8ed \u0393abs. \u2212(\u0393S + \u0393rel. ) 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed pR \uf8f8 .\ndt\np\np\n0\n\u0393\n\u2212\u0393\n2\n\nS\n\nD\n\npR\n\u0393S \u0393abs.\n=\n,\npL + pR\n\u0393S + \u0393abs. + \u0393rel.\n= \u0393D .\n\n\u0393in = \u0393S\n\n2\n\n(1)\nAgain, we assume positive detuning, with \u03b4 \u226b kB T .

(3) suggest\nthat we can take \u0393S , \u0393D to be independent of detuning.\nThe rate \u0393in in Eq. (4) thus reflects the dependence of\n\u0393abs. /\u0393rel. on detuning. Assuming also \u0393rel. to be constant, a measurement of \u0393in gives directly the absorbtion\nspectrum of the DQD. The measurements cannot exclude\nthat \u0393rel. also varies with \u03b4, but as we show below the\nmodel assuming \u0393rel. independent of detuning fits the\ndata well.\nEquation (4) shows that the low-bandwidth detector\ncan be used to measure the absorbtion spectrum, even in\nthe presence of fast relaxation. Moreover, the detection\nof an electron entering the DQD implies that a quantum\nof energy was absorbed immediately before the electron\nwas detected. The charge detector signal thus relates\ndirectly to the detection of a single photon.\nIn the following, we use the DQD to quantitatively\ninvestigate the microwave radiation emitted from the\nnearby QPC. Figure 4(a) shows the measured \u0393in versus detuning and QPC bias. The data was taken along\nthe dashed line of Fig. 2(a), with gate voltages converted\ninto energy using lever arms extracted from finite bias\nmeasurements. Due to the tunnel coupling t between the\nQDs, the energy\nlevel separation \u220612 of the DQD is given\n\u221a\nby \u220612 = 4 t2 + \u03b4 2 . The dashed lines in 4(a) show \u220612 ,\nwith t = 32 \u03bceV. A striking feature is that there are no\ncounts in regions with |eVQP C | < \u220612 . This originates\nfrom the fact that the voltage-biased QPC can only emit\nphotons with energy h\u0304\u03c9 \u2264 eVQP C [5, 8, 9]. The result\npresents another strong evidence that the absorbed photons originate from the QPC.\nTo describe the results quantitatively, we consider the\nemission spectrum of a voltage biased QPC with one conducting channel. In the low-temperature limit kB T \u226a\nh\u0304\u03c9, the spectral noise density SI (\u03c9) for the emission side\n(\u03c9 > 0) takes the form (see [9] for the full expression)\nSI (\u03c9) =\n\n4e2\neVQP C \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9\nD(1 \u2212 D)\n,\nh\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(eVQP C \u2212h\u0304\u03c9)/kB T\n\n(5)\n\nwhere D is the transmission coefficient of the channel.\nUsing the model of Ref.

Equation (6) states how well fluctuations in the QPC couple\nto the DQD system.\nFigure 4(b) shows the measured absorbtion rates versus VQP C , taken for three different values of \u03b4. As expected from Eqs. (5, 6), the absorption rates increase\nlinearly with bias voltage as soon as |eVQP C | > \u03b4. The\ndifferent slopes for the three data sets are due to the\n1/\u2206212 -dependence in the relation between the emission\nspectrum and the absorption rate of Eq. (6). In Fig. 4(c),\nwe present measurements of the absorption spectrum for\nfixed VQP C . The rates decrease with increased detuning,\nwith sharp cut-offs as |\u03b4| > eVQP C . In the region of small\ndetuning, the absorption rates saturate as the DQD level\n\n[1] C. W. J. Beenakker and H. Schomerus, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n86, 700 (2001).\n[2] J. Gabelli, L.-H. Reydellet, G.

Roche,\n\nseparation \u220612 approaches the limit set by the tunnel\ncoupling. The dashed lines show the combined results\nof Eqs. (4-6), with parameters T = 0.1 K, Zl = 0.7 k\u03a9,\nD = 0.5, t = 32 \u03bceV, k = 0.15, \u0393S = 1.2 kHz and\n\u0393D = 1.1 kHz. Using \u0393rel. as a fitting parameter, we find\n1/\u0393rel. = 5 ns. This should be seen as a rough estimate\nof \u0393rel. due to uncertainties in Zl , but it shows reasonable\nagreement with previously reported measurements [23].\nThe overall good agreement between the data and the\nelectrostatic model of Eq. (6) supports the assumption\nthat the interchange of energy between the QPC and the\nDQD is predominantly mediated by photons instead of\nphonons or plasmons.\nThe data for VQP C = 400 \u03bcV shows some irregularities\ncompared to theory, especially at large positive detuning.\nWe speculate that the deviations are due to excited states\nof the individual QDs, with excitation energies smaller\nthan the detuning. In Fig. 4(d), we convert the detuning\n\u03b4 to level separation \u220612 and use Eq. (6) to extract the\nnoise spectrum SI of the QPC. The linear dependence of\nthe noise with respect to frequency corresponds well to\nthe behavior expected from Eq. (5). Again, the deviations at \u220612 = 190 \u03bceV are probably due to an excited\nstate in one of the QDs. The single-level spacing of the\nQD is \u2206E \u2248 200 \u03bceV, which sets an upper bound on\nfrequencies that can be detected with this method. The\nfrequency-range can be extended by using DQD in carbon nanotubes [24] or InAs nanowires [25, 26], where the\nsingle-level spacing is significantly larger.\nTo summarize, we have shown that a DQD can be\nused as a frequency-selective detector for microwave radiation. Time-resolved charge detection techniques allow\nsingle photons to be detected, giving the method a very\nhigh sensitivity. The ability to detect single photons also\nopens up the possibility to investigate the statistics of the\nabsorbed radiation. By fabricating a pair of DQD devices\nand investigating the cross-correlations, time-dependent\nphoton correlations can be directly measured [1]. To\nprove the principle of the device we have investigated\nthe high-frequency spectrum of radiation emitted from a\nvoltage-biased QPC. The emission rate was found to increase linearly with applied bias, with a spectrum having\na sharp cut-off for frequencies higher than the QPC bias.\n\nD. C. Glattli, A. Cavanna, and Y.
