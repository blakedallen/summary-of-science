This research area has a long history, since the possibility of a quantised\nstructure of spacetime at short distances was first mentioned as early as in the 1930's in some\ncorrespondence among Heisenberg, Peierls, Pauli and Oppenheimer [5, 6], and in the papers\npublished by Snyder [7], by Yang [8] and by Moyal [9] during the 1940's. Although the original\nmotivation to use non-commutativity as a tool to regularise QFT was soon frustrated - while the\nrenormalisation approach proved to be a successful method to handle the divergences encountered\nin the formulation in commutative spacetime -, non-commutative spaces have attracted renewed\ninterest in more recent years, with the application of this formalism to solid-state physics, to the\nproblem of the quantum Hall effect [10], to the study of MHD waves in astrophysics [11], and with\nthe discovery of the relevance of such spaces to string theory [12\u201318] and to a possible quantum\ntheory of gravity [19, 20].\nGroenewold-Moyal Rn\u03b8 spaces are among the most extensively studied non-commutative spaces.\nThe properties of QFT defined in these spaces - including those related to renormalisability, causality, non-locality, Poincar\u00e9 invariance et coetera - have been addressed in several\nworks [21\u201344]; a lattice-like regularised formulation has also allowed to investigate numerically\nvarious aspects of these models [45\u201354]. In particular, one of the most interesting - albeit troublesome - features is the fact that the effective action describing QFT in a Groenewold-Moyal\nspace is divergent when the external momentum along the non-commutative directions vanishes:\nthis effect arises from the integration of the high-energy modes in non-planar loop diagrams, and\nis henceforth called \"ultra-violet/infra-red (UV/IR) mixing\".\nAnother class of non-commutative spaces is given by fuzzy spaces: they are built approximating the infinite-dimensional algebra of functions on some particular manifold by means of a\nfinite-dimensional algebra of matrices. Under some conditions, this construction is possible for\neven-dimensional co-adjoint orbits of Lie groups which are symplectic manifolds - see [55\u201368]\nand references therein. In particular, co-adjoint orbits of semi-simple Lie groups are adjoint orbits; examples include the CP n complex projective spaces. The most-widely known example of\na fuzzy space is the fuzzy two-sphere SF2 [55], built truncating the algebra of functions on the\ncommutative sphere S 2 to a maximum angular momentum lmax . The fuzzy sphere depends on\ntwo parameters: the matrix size N = lmax + 1 and the radius R; the commutative sphere and the\nnon-commutative plane can be obtained in different limits of N and R.\nA one-loop perturbative calculation shows that, for every finite N , QFT on the fuzzy sphere\nis finite; furthermore, the theory is not affected by the UV/IR mixing problem [69] (although -\ndue to a non-commutative anomaly - the latter re-emerges once a double-scaling limit is taken,\nin which the fuzzy sphere goes over to the non-commutative plane R2\u03b8 ). This feature, as well as\nthe fact that the fuzzy approach explicitly preserves the symmetries of the original manifold for\nany value of N and allows a well-defined treatment of the topological properties [70\u201384], has led\nto suggest the fuzzy space as a potentially interesting candidate for regularisation of quantum\nfield theory.\nAs a matter of fact, QFT on the fuzzy sphere is mathematically well-defined and finite [85],\n1\n\n\fand the formulation is amenable to a non-perturbative approach and to numerical studies using\nMonte Carlo simulations, with fields represented as finite-dimensional matrices. This approach\nhas been followed in various recent works [86\u201392].\nIn the present paper we address a detailed Monte Carlo study of the \u03a64 scalar field theory\non the fuzzy sphere; among other issues of interest, this simple model provides a laboratory to\ntest the possibility to use the fuzzy space approach as a potential regularisation scheme for more\nrealistic field theories. As it concerns the practical implementation of Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe model, we shall present a novel algorithm, which reduces the autocorrelation time, combining\noverrelaxation steps with ergodic configuration updates.\nPreliminary results of this study have been presented in [93].\nThis manuscript has the following structure: in section 2 the theoretical framework underlying the model is recalled, and the basic notations are introduced. In section 3 we discuss the\nimplementation of the numerical simulations of the model, and present the results obtained with\nour algorithm. In section 4 we comment on the implications of these results and on possible\nresearch perspectives. A technical discussion of the algorithm is presented in the Appendix A.\n\n2\n\nReview of the construction of the model\n\nA general discussion of the mathematical construction of fuzzy spaces can be found in many\nexcellent articles and books, like, for instance [67]; for the scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere\nSF2 , we refer the reader to the detailed presentation in [85].\nThe basic idea is to replace the infinite-dimensional, commutative algebra of polynomials\ngenerated by the {xi }i=1,2,3 coordinates on the two-dimensional sphere xi xi = R2 embedded\nin R3 with a non-commutative algebra generated by {x\u0302i }i=1,2,3 operators satisfying a (trivially\nrescaled) su(2) Lie algebra. The latter can be realised using the Wigner-Jordan construction of\nthe su(2) generators, restricting to the finite-dimensional (N -dimensional) subspace of the Fock\nspace generated by a pair of mutually commuting creation operators. Accordingly, the algebra\nof functions on the commutative sphere S 2 is replaced by the MatN algebra, whose elements can\nbe expanded into irreducible representations of su(2).\nThe fuzzy sphere admits the commutative sphere S 2 and the Groenewold-Moyal plane R2\u03b8 as\ntwo different limits: the former is recovered for N \u2192 \u221e with R fixed, whereas the latter can be\nobtained - at least locally - via a stereographic projection from a fixed point, in the double\nlimit: N \u2192 \u221e, R \u2192 \u221e, keeping R2 /N fixed.\nThe action for a massive, neutral, scalar field with quartic interactions on the fuzzy can be\ndefined - according to the conventions used in [86] - as:\nS=\n\n\u0001\n4\u03c0\ntr \u03a6 [Li , [Li , \u03a6]] + rR2 \u03a62 + \u03bbR2 \u03a64 ,\nN\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 MatN is hermitian and can be expanded in the {\u0176l,m } polarisation tensor basis as:\n\u03a6=\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nl\nX\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\n2\n\ncl,m \u0176l,m .\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe model can be quantised in the path integral approach, defining the expectation values of\ngeneric observables O = O(cl,m ), which can be evaluated perturbatively, or estimated numerically\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe perturbative treatment of the theory is formulated via a proper definition of the Feynman\nrules - in particular, the interaction vertices are modified in a non-trivial way, which depends\non N , and is consistent with the fusion rules. A careful one-loop analysis of this model [69] shows\nthat the UV/IR mixing phenomenon does not occur on SF2 ; however, a non-commutative anomaly\nshows up, as a finite difference between planar and non-planar tadpole diagrams.\nThis anomaly is expressed by a rotationally invariant, non-local contribution to the quantum\neffective action; it distorts the dispersion relation, and survives the limit to the commutative\nsphere. This seriously threatens the possibility to consider the fuzzy approach as a bona fide\nregularisation scheme for theories defined in a commutative space; however, according to [94], the\nproblem may be overcome, redefining the interaction term in the matrix action with a normalordering prescription, which allows to cancel the undesired momentum-dependent quadratic terms\nin the effective action. An alternative, and more general, possibility would be to include rotationally symmetric higher derivative terms in the action, as suggested in [95].\nOn the other hand, when the Groenewold-Moyal plane limit is taken, the non-commutative\nanomaly reproduces the logarithmic divergence which is characteristic of the UV/IR mixing [28].\nFuzzy spaces were studied in [33] as a mean to regularise scalar field theory in non-commutative\nn\nR\u03b8 spaces. There, it was shown that different phases can be distinguished in the large N limit,\naccording to the form of the distribution of eigenvalues associated to the matrix \u03a6. The argument\ngoes as follows: For the free case, in the large N limit and assuming that the cut-off is much\nlarger than the non-commutative scale, the leading contribution to the expectation values of even\npowers (2k) of the field come from planar diagrams. Next, one observes that, in the large N limit,\na clustering property for the expectation values of products of integrals of the field holds, and\nimplies that the measure is strongly localised. This allows to identify the eigenvalue distribution\nas the Wigner semi-circle law, which holds for gaussian random matrix models [96, 97].\nNext, one can generalise to include interactions: for a scalar theory with bare square mass\nm2 and quartic interactions with coupling 4g in non-commutative space the resulting eigenvalue\ndistribution is known exactly [98]: for m2 larger than a critical value m2crit the eigenvalue density\n\u03c1g (\u03c6) has a connected support and is given by:\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015p\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032 2\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03c62\n(3)\n\u03c1g (\u03c6) =\ng \u03c6 +\n+ (m )\n2\u03c0\n2\nwhere g\u2032 and (m\u2032 )2 are related to g and m2 - see [33] for the details. On the contrary, for\nm2 < m2crit , the eigenvalue distribution exhibits two disconnected peaks of finite width.\nAlthough the arguments underlying this derivation are expected to hold only approximately\nin the two-dimensional case (because the dominance of the planar diagrams over the non-planar\nones is weaker than in four dimensions), one can check if the numerical results are consistent with\nthe predicted features.\nThe real scalar model with quartic interactions on the fuzzy sphere was studied numerically\nin [86, 87], where it was shown that the model exhibits three different phases: a disordered\n3\n\n\fphase, in which the field typically fluctuates around zero; a uniform order phase, characterised by\nfluctuations around the broken-symmetry minima of the potential, and a non-uniform order phase,\nwhich was described as new, intermediate, phase, intrinsically related to the matrix nature of the\nfuzzy regularisation. The appearance of the latter was interpreted assuming that, in a certain\nparameter range, the kinetic contribution to the action might be negligible, and the dynamics of\nthe system were effectively reduced to the framework of a pure potential model [99, 100]. This\nphase was also described as analogous to the striped phase predicted in [30] for non-commutative\nGroenewold-Moyal spaces, and observed numerically in [51, 52].\n\n3\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nThe numerical approach to the model is completely straightforward, and, under many respects,\nanalogous to the more conventional lattice setting.1 Expectation values of the observables are\nestimated from averages over finite ensembles of matrices {\u03a6}, characterised by a statistical\nweight which depends on the model dynamics; the algorithm generating the matrix ensemble is\nbuilt combining overrelaxation steps [101, 102] and canonical updates.\nFor the configuration-updating process, different types of pseudo-random number generators\nwere compared; the G05CAF generator of the NAG library has eventually been used in the\nproduction runs.\nFor each choice of the (N, r, \u03bb, R) parameters, the autocorrelation time between elements in the\nthermalised matrix ensemble has been calculated using the auto-windowing procedure [108]; the\nexpectation values of the various observables have been evaluated from ensembles of statistically\nuncorrelated matrices. The data analysis was done using standard techniques, and errorbars have\nbeen estimated using the jackknife method - see, for instance, [109].\nIn the r < 0 regime, it is particularly interesting to study the behaviour associated with the\nvarious l-modes. The classical minima of the potential correspond to uniform distributions and\nobviously their physical content is purely described by the scalar (l=0) channel. Since we are\ndealing with a quantum model and the system size is finite, the ground state is actually unique,\nas quantum fluctuations allow finite-action tunneling events between the two minima. When r is\nnegative in sign and large in modulus, the profile of the potential is very steep, and the typical\nmatrix configurations lie in a close neighbourhood around the classical minima; the trace of \u03a6\nallows to identify around which of the two minima the matrix is lying at a given Monte Carlo\ntime. The \"trace susceptibility\", defined as:\n\u03c7 = h(tr\u03a6)2 i \u2212 h|tr\u03a6|i2 ,\n1\n\n(4)\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the fuzzy space approach to a quantum theory differs with respect to the\nlattice formulation in a number of aspects, which also have practical implications for the computer simulations. In\nparticular, in lattice field theory there exist many efficient update methods (including, for instance, those described\nin [101\u2013107]) which are based on the locality of the discretised action; these methods allow to strongly damp the\nautocorrelation among subsequent configurations in the Markov chain. Furthermore, parallel computation can\noften be implemented in a straightforward way. On the contrary, in the fuzzy setting, the dynamics of each degree\nof freedom is non-trivially entangled with each other's, and - in general - the implementation of analogous\ntechniques is not trivial.\n\n4\n\n\fencodes the physical information about the fluctuations of tr\u03a6. When r is increased to values\ncloser to zero, the trace susceptibility exhibits a peak, corresponding to a maximum in the\nquantum fluctuations. As usual, the location of a maximum in the susceptibility approximately2\nidentifies the critical value where the \"phase transition\" to the disordered phase would occur, for\nan infinite system.\n1.6\n\n1.4\nN=6\nN=5\nN=4\nN=3\n\n1.2\n\n\u03c7\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-1.6\n\n-1.4\n\n-1.2\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n4 \u03c0 r R2N-3\n\nFigure 1: Behaviour of the trace susceptibility, as defined in eq. (4).\nThe model already exhibits good scaling properties for small matrix sizes N < 10. As an\n3\nexample, figure 1 shows the results obtained for the susceptibility, along the \u03bb = N\n4\u03c0 line: the\npeak gets very pronounced as N is increased, and its location is not affected by strong finite-N\neffects.\nTaking a closer look at the matrix ensembles and at their physical content in non-zero momenta allows to detect the non-uniform modes, and the r\u00f4le they play in the regime under\nconsideration. A simple variational analysis shows that also the commutative sphere can admit\nnon-uniform configurations characterised by a finite, negative total amount of action.3 Numerically, the relevance of these configurations can be quantified through the average values of the\nsquare moduli of the cl,m coefficients for l \u2265 1. The latter are indeed found to be non-vanishing\nfor all of the N , \u03bb and r values which we investigated; again, in agreement with [86, 87], we\nobserved a parameter range where the expectation value of the l = 1 mode is larger than the\nscalar component.\nThe transition from the uniform- to the non-uniform-order phase can be interpreted as an\n2\n\nModulo corrections due to the finiteness of N and/or R.\nIt is easy to verify analytically that - at least in some parameter ranges - even an axially symmetric (but\nnon-uniform) configuration described in terms of the first Legendre polynomial may be favoured with respect to the\n\u03a6 = 0 uniform configuration, and thus mediate the tunneling events among the classical minima of the potential.\n3\n\n5\n\n\feffect arising when the kinetic contribution to the action becomes negligible with respect to the\npotential one [86, 87].\nAs figure 2 shows, our results confirm that at the transition the average kinetic contribution is\nmuch smaller than the modulus of the potential. However, this behaviour persists (and is, in fact,\nenhanced) down to more strongly negative r-values in the uniform order regime, too - a fact\nthat does not allow to interpret the existence of the striped phase as solely due to the potential\ndominance.\n40\n\n35\n\nN=15, kinetic\nN=15, potential\nN=19, kinetic\nN=19, potential\nN=21, kinetic\nN=21, potential\nN=23, kinetic\nN=23, potential\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1.8\n\n-1.6\n\n-1.4\n\n-1.2\n\n-1\n\nr R2N-3/2\n\nFigure 2: Average values of the kinetic term and modulus of the potential per degree of freedom,\nin the proximity of the transition between the disorder and striped phases. Data obtained at\n3\u03c0N\nfixed \u03bb = 25R\n2.\nRather, the results are compatible with the fact that the tunneling between the minima\nof the potential may be mediated by matrix configurations corresponding to non-sphericallysymmetric distributions on the sphere. This can be easily justified from the analytical point of\nview (evaluating explicitly the action associated to such configurations), and is fully consistent\nwith the numerical data (which confirm a non-negligible expectation value for the modes with\nl 6= 0 when r is not very far from zero).\nHaving presented the general features of the phase structure of the model, we now address the\ntest of the theoretical predictions formulated in [33]4 : The model can be described by means of\nrandom matrix methods, and is characterised by well-defined properties of the eigenvalue sector.\nIn particular, the phase transition is associated with a change in the topology of the support of\nthe eigenvalue distribution.\n4\n\nNote that the conventions in [33] differ with respect to eq. (1) and to those used in [86] by a trivial rescaling\nof the \u03a6 matrix, and the coefficients of the quadratic and quartic terms in the potential are denoted as m2 and g,\nrespectively.\n\n6\n\n\fWe concentrated our attention onto matrices of size N = 15, 19, 21, 23, 31, 41 and 81.\nAt intermediate and large values of g the data agree well with the theoretical prediction, and\nthe theoretical prediction is indeed confirmed in the double-scaling limit. Figure 3 shows the\nevolution of the eigenvalue density, from the one-cut to the two-cut phase.\nWe should emphasise that the agreement observed is highly non-trivial, because the arguments underlying the derivation in [33] are expected to hold only approximately in two dimensions.5 Although it would not be completely justified to perform a fit of the data to the curve,\nthe agreement between the numerical results and the theoretical curve, which is a completely\nparameter-free prediction and does not involve any fitting procedure, is striking.\nOn the contrary, the model exhibits significant quantitative deviations from the expected\ncritical point at small g values. Although the qualitative pattern of the transition is confirmed,\nthe location of the transition point is shifted towards more negative r values. In fact, this is\nnot surprising: in this regime, the secondary maxima in the eigenvalue distribution are no longer\nnegligible; the system could rather be described by a multi-trace model [110].\nHowever, the general agreement of numerical results and theoretical predictions is also confirmed by the scaling properties of the eigenvalue density support. The samples where the observed width of the distribution support differs from the expected one by an amount of the order\nof 5 \u2013 10% or more correspond to strongly negative r values - which actually may even already\nlie in the \"uniformly ordered\" phase.6\nTable 1 shows results for the numerical critical values of rR2 , for various matrix sizes.\nIn the remaining part of this section, we shortly discuss the case when the classical potential\nhas a unique minimum, and propose a method to detect the effect of the non-commutative\nanomaly.\nA perturbative study of the model in this regime was presented in [69]7 . As it was discussed\nabove, the non-commutative anomaly shows up as a (mild) non-local effect, distorting the energymomentum relation on the fuzzy sphere by a finite amount.\nThe one-loop effective action on the fuzzy sphere is [69]:\n\u0014 2\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0010 \u0011 \u0015\n\u03b4\u03bc 2\n1\ng\n4\u03c0\n \u0303\ntr\n\u03a6 \u2212\n\u03a6h \u2206 \u03a6 + O\n,\n(5)\nSone-loop = S0 +\nN +1\n2\n24\u03c0\nN\nwhere \u03b4\u03bc2 is the square-mass renormalisation:\n\nN\n2J + 1\ng X\n,\n\u03b4\u03bc =\n8\u03c0\nJ(J + 1) + \u03bc2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nJ=0\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n \u0303 ; h(x) is the\nwhile the non-commutative anomaly is given by the contribution involving h \u2206\nPx 1\n \u0303 is a function of the Laplace operator,\nharmonic number: h(x) = t=1 t , with h(0) = 0, and \u2206\n5\n\nThis is due to the weaker dominance of planar diagrams over the non-planar ones in D = 2.\nThe critical line corresponding to the transition from the non-uniform to the uniform order phase was obtained\nnumerically in [87], but a full theoretical description of this transition in the fuzzy sphere setting is still missing.\n7\nIn the notations\nof [69], the radius is set to the unit, the \u03a6 matrix (whose size is denoted as N + 1) is rescaled\n\u221a\nby a factor 2 with respect to eq.

However, due to\nthe theoretical approximations and technical difficulties involved in the observation of these fine\neffects, our data do not allow to make conclusive statements about this issue. This problem may\nbe addressed more thoroughly in future work.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe data in the previous section confirm the theoretical predictions for a scalar theory on the\nfuzzy sphere, as well as previous numerical results for the same model. The novel algorithm we\nused for the simulation proved to be very efficient, enabling us to obtain high-precision results for\nboth the regimes that were investigated. The algorithm strongly reduces the correlation among\nsubsequent configurations in a Markov chain, in a way which is compatible with the dynamics of\nthe quantum system, and limiting undesired numerical artefacts to a minimum.\nAs it concerns the case of a classical scalar potential with two degenerate minima, our data,\nobtained from simulations at a large number of points in the space of physical parameters of\n10\n\n\fthe model, confirm and generalise the results obtained in similar numerical works [86, 87]. We\nhave discussed the r\u00f4le of non-uniform configurations on a fixed, finite radius sphere and their\nrelevance to tunneling events connecting the classical vacua - a phenomenon which is not due\nto the non-commutative nature of the fuzzy regularisation, nor can it be directly interpreted as\na signature of the UV/IR mixing.8\nYet, the relation to UV/IR mixing shows up, once one considers the double-scaling limit,\nand looks at the distribution for the matrix eigenvalues, which behave as a set of collective,\nintrinsically non-local degrees of freedom, and whose statistical properties can be worked out via\nrandom matrix methods. The UV/IR mixing manifests itself as the high-energy modes suppress\nthe distribution of the low-energy ones.\nIn our numerical study, we have successfully compared the observed eigenvalue distribution\nwith the predicted pattern. The eigenvalues, rescaled through a factor predicted by the theory, fit\nvery well to the [\u22121, 1] range, and their density undergoes a transition from the \"one-cut\" to the\n\"two-cut\" regime. Although for the two-dimensional case one would only expect an approximate\nagreement, the data for \u03c1(\u03c6) follow the theoretical curve very closely - except at very small\ng-values, where a multi-trace model [110] would probably provide a better description of the\nsystem.\nNext, we have also considered the m2 > 0 regime, and proposed an approximate method\nto observe the non-commutative anomaly, through the spectrum distortion at high momenta.\nUnfortunately, the parameter range in which unambiguous results can be obtained is severely\nlimited, due to theoretical and numerical constraints. The results of a pilot study using this\nmethod look compatible with the expected effect, but for the moment they do not allow us to\ndraw definite conclusions about the large-N limit; this aspect may be addressed again in future\nwork.\nIn conclusion, we can say that the non-perturbative results obtained in the present work\nconfirm the current theoretical understanding of this simple non-commutative model, and the\nvirtues and limits of the fuzzy approach as a regularisation scheme.\nOn one hand, it is clear that the effects associated with non-commutativity are intrinsic to the\nfuzzy regularisation, and the presence of the anomaly discussed above threatens the possibility\nto use fuzzy spaces as a straightforward regularisation for QFT in ordinary (i.e. commutative)\nspaces. In this perspective, it would be particularly interesting to study in more detail the\nproposals that have been formulated [94, 95] to define an improved formulation of the action,\nyielding the correct QFT limit.\nOn the other hand, the results discussed in this paper provide evidence that fuzzy spaces\nare indeed a well-suited regularisation scheme for theoreies directly defined in non-commutative\nspaces - e.g. Groenewold-Moyal Rn\u03b8 spaces - and offer the possibility for a practical and efficient\nimplementation of numerical studies of these models.\nThe success of this numerical study in the two-dimensional setting is very encouraging, and\nin the future it may be very interesting to address the D = 4 case. This generalisation would\n8\n\nIt may be instructive to point out that the situation for a finite-radius sphere is different with respect to the\ncase of an infinite plane.\n\n11\n\n\fobviously be of great interest from the physical point of view, and - apart from a larger computational effort - it is not expected to involve particularly difficult technical problems. In fact,\nthe observation of the most interesting non-commutative effects may even turn out to be simpler\nthan in D = 2 - due to the reasons discussed above.\n\nAcknowledgements.\nIt is a pleasure to thank A.P.

It allows to damp the autocorrelation between subsequent elements in the\nMarkov chain of configurations.\nThe basic idea is related to the overrelaxation technique in lattice gauge theory [101, 102]:\nThe trial value in the update process of a given variable is chosen to be \"as far as possible\" from\nthe original value, and such that the action of the system is unchanged.9 In the lattice setting,\nthis can be accomplished through a group reflection which can be worked out exactly for the\nSU (2) group, and in an efficient way for a generic SU (N ) group [111,112]. This technique cannot\nbe directly implemented in the present case, due to the fact that the \u03a6 variable takes values in a\ndomain of different nature: the space of hermitian matrices of size N is non-compact, and, more\nimportant, a na\u0131\u0308ve \"reflection\" of the \u03a6 matrix would not be effective for the purpose of reducing\nthe autocorrelation time, since it would not allow to explore all of the physical orbits.\nThe algorithm we built generalises the principia underlying the overrelaxation technique,\nadapting them to the present case, and it works as follows: Assume \u03a60 to be the initial matrix\nconfiguration, obtained with some ergodic procedure; let S0 = S(\u03a60 ) be the associated euclidean\naction. Let \u03a6\u22c6 be a new, completely random (and, therefore, completely independent from \u03a60 )\nhermitian matrix in MatN , with S\u22c6 = S(\u03a6\u22c6 ) the corresponding value of the action. If S\u22c6 > S0 ,10\na new hermitian matrix \u03a61 , such that: S1 = S(\u03a61 ) = S0 , can be built rescaling \u03a6\u22c6 as:\n\u03a61 = \u03b1\u03a6\u22c6 ,\nprovided the following condition:\n(\n(S0 > 0) \u2228\n\ntr \u03a6\u22c6 [Li , [Li , \u03a6\u22c6 ]] + rR\n\n(A.1)\n\n2\n\n\u03a62\u22c6\n\n\u0001\n\n< \u2212R\n\nr\n\nN \u03bbS0\ntr\u03a64\u22c6\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\n!)\n\n(A.2)\n\nis true. If that is not the case, then \u03a6\u22c6 is redefined (possibly iteratively) as:\n\u03a6\u22c6 \u2212\u2192\n\n\u03a6\u22c6 + \u03a60\n2\n\n(A.3)\n\nuntil the condition in eq. (A.2) is satisfied. Note that this shift would drive \u03a6\u22c6 closer and closer to\n\u03a60 , thus inducing a correlation between corresponding matrix entries in \u03a61 and \u03a60 ; nevertheless,\nin general the eventual value obtained for \u03a61 may belong to a different physical orbit with respect\nto \u03a60 .\nThe algorithm is efficient under general conditions, including the cases in which S(\u03a6) is a\nfunction which varies strongly even for moderate changes in its argument, because the process\ndriving \u03a6\u22c6 towards \u03a60 is exponentially fast, its implementation only involves trivial numerical\noperations, and terminates in a finite (and typically small) number of steps.11\n9\n\nThis implies that the overrelaxation procedure is microcanonical; therefore the method is always combined\nwith other canonical techniques, in order to ensure ergodicity of the whole update process.\n10\nIf S\u22c6 \u2264 S0 , then \u03a6\u22c6 is accepted as the new matrix configuration.\n11\nThis is easily proven using continuity and the fact that the trivial \u03b1 = 1 solution exists for \u03a6\u22c6 = \u03a60 .\n\n13\n\n\f3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n2\naction per d.o.f.\ntr \u03a6\n\n-3\n\n-3\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\u03c4\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n-3\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\u03c4\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\u03c4\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nFigure 5: Left: A typical Monte Carlo history of the action per degree of freedom and of tr(\u03a6),\nobtained without overrelaxation; the data fluctuate close to one of the two minima of the potential,\nand tunneling events are very rare. Data obtained from matrices of size N = 27, in the two-cut\nregime. Center: Same as in the previous plot, but invoking the overrelaxation algorithm at Monte\nCarlo times \u03c4 = 400, 800, 1200 and 1600. Right: Same as in the previous plot, but replacing the\noverrelaxation steps with new starts from unthermalised configurations.\nThis algorithm proves superior to standard Metropolis (because it is not affected by the\nergodicity problem) and to repeated new starts, because full thermalisation takes longer; figure 5\nshows a comparison.\nThe initial hermitian matrix \u03a6\u22c6 can be chosen according to an arbitrary distribution; in order\nto achieve the best efficiency, we tested various possibilities, and in the production runs the matrix\nelements of \u03a6\u22c6 were chosen according to a gaussian distribution centered around zero; the width\nof the gaussian is tuned according to an optimisation criterion.\nThe number of ergodic updates between the overrelaxation steps is another tunable parameter\nof the algorithm. Typically, for the results presented here, one overrelaxation step was invoked\nevery 50, 200, 500, 1000, or 2000 steps.\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Doplicher, K. Fredenhagen and J. E. Roberts, Commun.
