I NTRODUCTION\nLet f be a holomorphic Morse function without zeros on a complex analytic manifold. It gives rise to a real-valued Morse function\n/ f (z)/|f (z)|.\n/ |f (z)| and a circle-valued Morse function z \u2724\nz \u2724\nThese two functions can be used to study the topology of the underlying manifold. There are, however, numerous technical problems,\nand this approach works only in some rare particular cases. This\npaper is about one of such cases, namely, the case of the complement to a complex hyperplane arrangement in Cn .\nLet \u03bei : Cn \u2192 C be non-constant affine functions (1 6 i 6 m); put\nHi = Ker \u03bei . Denote by A the hyperplane arangement {H1 , . . . , Hm }\nand put\n[\nHi ,\nM (A) = Cn \\ H.\nH=\ni\n\nWe will abbreviate M (A) to M . The rank of A is the maximal codimension of a non-empty intersection of some subfamily of A. We say\nthat A is essential if rk L = n. Assume that A is essential. We prove\nthat M has the homotopy type of a space obtained from a finite ndimensional CW complex fibered over a circle, by attaching |\u03c7(M )|\ncells of dimension n, and apply these results to the computation of\nthe Novikov homology of M .\nThe homology of rank one local systems over M has been extensively studied. It was shown that this homology vanishes except\nin the case of dimension n for generic local systems (see [2], [5]).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTOSHITAKE KOHNO AND ANDREI PAJITNOV\n\nThese homology groups play an important role in the theory of hypergeometric integrals and have been investigated in relation with\nthe cohomology of the twisted de Rham cohomology of logarithmic\nforms (see [3], [4]).\nDefinition 1.1. A homomorphism \u03be : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 R is called positive\nif its value on the positive meridian of each hyperplane Hi is strictly\npositive.\nc\u2217 (X, \u03be) for\nWe show that the structure of the Novikov homology H\npositive homomorphisms \u03be is similar to that of the generic local coefficient homology, namely, it vanishes in all degrees except n.\n2. M AIN\n\nRESULTS\n\nLet A be an essential arrangement. Let \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ) be a\nstring of complex numbers. P. Orlik and H. Terao [8] proved that\nfor \u03b1 outside a closed algebraic subset of Cm the multivalued holo\u03b1m\nhas only non-degenerate\nmorphic function \u03a6\u03b1 = \u03be1\u03b11 * \u03be2\u03b12 * ... * \u03bem\ncritical points (see the works of K. Aomoto [2], and A. Varchenko [12]\nfor partial results in this direction).\nIn this paper we work only with \u03b1 \u2208 Rm . It follows from the OrlikTerao theorem that there is an open dense subset W \u2282 Rm such\nthat for \u03b1 \u2208 W the function \u03a6\u03b1 has only non-degenerate critical\npoints. Consider a real-valued C \u221e function\nY\n\u03b1\nf\u03b1 : Cn \\ H \u2192 R.\n\u03bei (z) i ,\nf\u03b1 (z) =\ni\n\nLemma 2.1. Let \u03b1 \u2208 W . Then f\u03b1 is a Morse function. The index of\nevery critical point of f\u03b1 equals n.\nRz\nP\ni\nProof. Let \u03c9\u03b1 = i \u03b1i d\u03be\n.\nThen\nf\n(z)\n=\nC\n*\nexp(Re\n\u03c9\u03b1 ), there\u03b1\nz0\n\u03bei\nfore, log f\u03b1 (z) locally is the real part of a holomorphic Morse function. In general, if h is a holomorphic Morse function on an open\nsubset of Cn , then Re h is a real-valued Morse function, and the index of every critical point of Re h equals n. Our assertion follows.\n\u0003\nLet \u03b5 > 0 and put\n(1)\n\nV = {z \u2208 Cn | f\u03b1 (z) = \u03b5},\n\nN = {z \u2208 Cn | f\u03b1 (z) > \u03b5}.\n\nDefinition 2.2. A vector \u03b1 \u2208 Rm is called positive if \u03b1i > 0 for all\ni. The set of all positive vectors is denoted by Rm\n+ . The rank of the\nvector \u03b1 \u2208 Rm is the dimension of the Q-vector space generated by\nthe components of \u03b1 in R.\n\n\fCIRCLE-VALUED MORSE THEORY FOR COMPLEX HYPERPLANE ARRANGEMENTS 3\n\nRecall that we denote Cn \\ H by M .\n\nTheorem 2.3.

We can assume that the intersection of the hyperplanes\ncontains 0, that is, the arrangement is central. Furthermore, it suffices to prove the Lemma for the case when\n\\\n(4)\nKer \u03bej = {0}.\nj\n\nIndeed, let L = \u2229j Ker \u03bej . Then it follows from (2) that both sides\nof our inequality (3) are invariant with respect to translations by\nvectors in L, and it is sufficient to prove the formula for the vector\nfield v\u03b1 |L\u22a5 .\nFurthermore, the both sides of the inequality are homogeneous of\ndegree \u22121, and it is sufficient to prove the inequality for z \u2208 \u03a3 \\ H,\nwhere \u03a3 stands for the sphere of radius 1 and center 0.\nWe will proceed by induction on m.

T HE\n\nHOMOTOPY TYPE OF\n\nM\n\nIn this section we prove the first two assertions of Theorem 2.3.\nWe fix a positive vector \u03b1. Choose a neighbourhood U of H so that\nthe conclusion of Proposition 3.2 holds. Observe that for \u03b5 > 0 small\nenough the set f\u03b1\u22121 ([0, \u03b5]) is in U , therefore, \u03b5 is a regular level of f\u03b1 ,\nand V is a submanifold of M of dimension 2n \u2212 1. This proves the\nsecond part of the assertion 1).\nTo prove the first part we use the shift along the flow lines of w\u0001\u03b1\nto construct the deformation retraction of M onto N = f\u03b1\u22121 [\u03b5, \u221e[ .\nIf \u03b5 > 0 is sufficiently small, then M \\ N \u2282 U , and for every integral\ncurve \u03b3(t) of w\u03b1 starting at a point x \u2208 M \\ N we have\nd\n\nf\u03b1 (\u03b3(t)) = gradf\u03b1 (\u03b3(t)), \u03b3 \u2032 (t) = f\u03b1 (\u03b3(t)) * ||v\u03b1 (\u03b3(t))|| > Afa (x)\n\ndt\n(for every t such that \u03b3(t) is in the set U ). Therefore, this trajectory\nwill reach f\u03b1\u22121 (\u03b5), and our deformation retraction is well-defined.\nMoving forward to the assertion 2), let us first outline the proof.\nChoose \u03b2 \u2208 Rm\n+ so that f\u03b2 : M \u2192 R is a Morse function, and \u03b2 is\nsufficiently close to \u03b1 so that the property (6) holds. We are going\nto apply the Morse theory to the restriction of f\u03b2 to the manifold\nN with boundary V . Our setting differs from the classical one (see\n[6]), essentially in 2 points: A) the manifold N is not compact, B)\nthe function f\u03b2 is not constant on the boundary of N . The main\ntechnical tool to deal with these issues is Proposition 3.2, which\ndescribes the behaviour of gradf\u03b2 in a neighbourhood of H. Using the classical Morse-theoretic schema (cf [6], \u00a73), we choose a\nsuitable gradient-like vector field u\u03b2 for f\u03b2 , and use the gradient\ndescent along (\u2212u\u03b2 )-trajectories to describe the changement of the\nhomotopy type of sublevel sets while crossing critical values. It is\ntechnically convenient to replace the couple (N, V ) by a suitable\nthickening. Let 0 < \u03b50 < \u03b5 and put\nN \u2032 = {z | f\u03b1 (z) > \u03b50 },\n\nL = {z | \u03b50 6 f\u03b1 (z) 6 \u03b5}.\n\nLemma 4.1. The inclusion of pairs (N, V ) \u2282 (N \u2032 , L) is a homotopy\nequivalence.\nProof. The shift along the trajectories of the vector field w\u03b1 determines a deformation retraction of (N \u2032 , L) onto (N, V ).\n\u0003\nWe proceed to the construction of a gradient-like vector field for\nf\u03b2 . We assume that \u03b2 is sufficiently close to \u03b1 so that the property\n(9) in Proposition 3.3 holds. For each critical point c of f\u03b2 choose a\nneighbourhood Rc of c such that Rc \u2229 U = \u2205; let R denote the union\n\n\f8\n\nTOSHITAKE KOHNO AND ANDREI PAJITNOV\n\nof all Rc . Put\nK = {z | f\u03b1 (z) 6 \u03b5}.\n\nUsing a partition of unity, it is easy to construct a C \u221e vector field u\u03b2\non Cn such that\n1) u\u03b2 | N is a gradient-like vector field for f\u03b2 .\n2) supp (w\u03b2 \u2212 u\u03b2 ) \u2282 R \u222a K.\n3) u\u03b2 | (K \u2212 L) = 0.\n4) For z \u2208 L we have u\u03b2 (z) = h(f\u03b2 (z))w\u03b2 (z) where h is a C \u221e\nfunction with the following properties:\nh(t) = 0\n\u2032\n\nif\n\nt 6 \u03b50 ,\n\nh (t) > 0\n\nh(t) = 1 if\n\nt > \u03b5,\n\nfor every \u03b50 < t < \u03b5.\n\nObserve that the vector field u\u03b2 is bounded, therefore, its integral\ncurves are defined on the whole of R.\nNow we can investigate the sublevel sets of the function f\u03b2 . For\nb \u2208 R put\nYb = {z | f\u03b2 (z) 6 b and f\u03b1 (z) > \u03b50 }.\nIt follows from the construction of the vector field u\u03b2 , that Yb is\n(\u2212u\u03b2 )-invariant, that is, every (\u2212u\u03b2 )-trajectory \u03b3(z, t) starting at\na point z \u2208 Yb remains in Yb for all t > 0. Furthermore, it follows\nfrom Proposition 3.3 that L is also (\u2212u\u03b2 )-invariant. Therefore, Yb \u222aL\nis (\u2212u\u03b2 )-invariant.\nProposition 4.2. Let 0 6 a < b and assume that f\u03b2 does not have\ncritical points in Yb \\ Ya .

For the\ncase A) observe that the set Yb \\ (Int Ya \u222a U ) is compact (since the\narrangement A is essential), the function f\u03b2 has no critical points in\nit and u\u03b2 is a gradient-like vector field for f\u03b2 . Thus the property (10)\nis true for z \u2208 Yb \\ (Int Ya \u222a U ).\n\n\fCIRCLE-VALUED MORSE THEORY FOR COMPLEX HYPERPLANE ARRANGEMENTS 9\n\nFor the case B) observe that when z \u2208 (Yb \u2229 U ) \\ (Ya \u222a L) we have\nu\u03b2 (z) = w\u03b2 (z) and\nf\u03b2\u2032 (z)(u\u03b2 (z)) = hv\u03b2 (z)f\u03b2 (z), w\u03b2 (z)i > a||v\u03b2 (z)|| > aA\n(see Proposition 3.2).\n, and assume that \u03b3(z, T ) \u2208\n/ Int L \u222a Int Ya . The\n2) Let T > b\u2212a\nC\nset Ya is obviously invariant with respect to the shift along (\u2212u\u03b2 )trajectories. The same is true for L, as it follows from (9).

The corresponding cohomology is denoted\nby H \u2217 (A, a). Let us call an element a resonant in degree j if the\ncohomology H j (A, a) does not vanish. Let b \u2208 Rm ; recall from Section 5 the corresponding homomorphism b : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 R and the\nP\ncohomology class b\nb = i bi \u03b8i \u2208 H 1 (M, R).\nProposition 16.7 of the paper [10] says, that if the Novikov hocj (M (A), b) equals 0 for j 6 q, then b\nb is non-resonant in\nmology H\ndegrees j 6 q. Thus our Theorem 2.4 implies that every positive\nvector b the corresponding cohomology class b\nb is non-resonant in\ndegrees strictly less than the rank of the arrangement. This also\nfollows from a result due to S. Yuzvinsky (see [13], [14]).\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported by World Premier International Research\nCenter Initiative (WPI Program), MEXT, Japan.\nThe work was accomplished during the second author's stay at the\nGraduate School of Mathematical Sciences, the University of Tokyo\nin the autumn of 2010 and 2011.
