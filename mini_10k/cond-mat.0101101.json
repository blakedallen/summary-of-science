If there are unquenched orbital degrees of freedom, however, then other mechanisms for anomalous behavior are possible. One such mechanism is the coupling\nof electronic charge fluctuations to phonons, and leads\nto magnetoelastic and Jahn-Teller phenomena. In the\ncase of localized electrons the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect (DJTE) may quench electronic degrees of freedom,\ncausing a reduction in the magnetic moment and forming\nstates of mixed magnetic and phonon character [1].\nElectron-lattice effects of this kind are of course well\nknown but the absence of a clean reference system has\nundoubtedly hindered their identification among other\nanomalous properties, especially in Ce and U compounds.\nIn this Letter we show that PrO2 represents such a model\nDJTE system. We find that magnetoelastic coupling has\na dramatic influence on the static and dynamic properties\nof PrO2 , and we provide the first direct measurements of\nthe magnetovibrational spectrum in a rare earth DJTE\nsystem. We also show that the Pr ions exist almost entirely in a localized 4f 1 configuration, in disagreement\nwith an intermediate valence model for PrO2 .\nPrO2 is an insulator with the fluorite structure type.\nIt exhibits type-I antiferromagnetic ordering below TN =\n14 K with an anomalously low ordered moment of\n\u223c0.6 \u03bcB [2]. The electronic ground state of PrO2 has,\ntogether with CeO2 and TbO2 , been controversial for\nmany years [3\u20136]. Core-level photoabsorption and photoemission spectra have been interpreted by some authors [3,4] in terms of an intermediate valence ground\nstate comprised of a roughly 50:50 admixture of localized (i.e. atomic-like) 4f 1 and 4f 2 states. Others [5,6],\nhowever, believe in a localized 4f 1 configuration with a\ndegree of covalent mixing such that the oxygen 2p valence band contains some extended states of f symme-\n\ntry. Publication of an influential model [7] describing\nan intermediate valence state in the anomalous cuprate\nPrBa2Cu3 O6+x (PrBCO) similar to that proposed for\nthe lanthanide dioxides has increased interest in PrO2 ,\nmaking it a key reference compound in high energy spectroscopic studies of PrBCO [8] and related materials.\nThe aim of the present work was to clarify the electronic ground state of PrO2. Neutron spectroscopy\nprobes electronic transitions within the ground state configuration both within and between the 2S+1 LJ terms,\nincluding splittings due to the crystalline electric field\n(CEF) or exchange fields. The low neutron energies\n(<\n\u223c 1 eV) and weak coupling to the electronic angular\nmomentum ensure that final state effects are insignificant. The experiments were performed on the High Energy Transfer (HET) chopper spectrometer at the ISIS\nFacility. On HET neutrons of well-defined incident energy Ei are delivered to the sample in short pulses. Spectra are recorded as a function of flight time in banks of\ndetectors surrounding the incident beam direction. Because the spectra are recorded at constant scattering angle \u03c6 the scattering vector Q p\nvaries with energy E thus:\nh\u03042 Q2 /2m = 2Ei \u2212 E \u2212 2 cos \u03c6 Ei (Ei \u2212 E).\nPolycrystalline samples of PrO2 were prepared by oxidation of commercially obtained Pr6 O11 . The starting\nmaterial was baked in air at 1000 \u25e6 C for several hours\nand then annealed either in flowing O2 at 280 \u25e6 C for approximately 20 days or under 300\u2013500 atm pressure of O2\nat 350 \u25e6 C for 3\u20135 days. The products were checked by xray diffraction and no trace of residual Pr6 O11 could be\ndetected. From this, and a comparison of our neutron\ndata with that of Pr6 O11 [9], we estimate an upper limit\nof 1% on the amount of Pr6 O11 impurity in our samples.\nFor the neutron measurements approximately 10 g of\nPrO2 was wrapped in aluminium foil and mounted in contact with the cold head of a closed-cyle refrigerator. Data\nwere collected with Ei = 30, 180, 450, 750 and 1200 meV,\nand the scattering from vanadium was used to normalize\n1\n\n\fthe spectra and to convert them into units of absolute\nscattering cross-section. The presented spectra correspond to the partial differential cross-section d2 \u03c3/d\u03a9dEf\nmultiplied by the factor ki /kf [10], where ki and kf are\nthe initial and final neutron wavevectors and Ef is the\nfinal energy. Measurements were made under identical\nconditions on a 10 g sample of polycrystalline CeO2 in\norder to estimate the non-magnetic (phonon + multiple\nscattering) background in the PrO2 data. CeO2 is an\nalmost ideal material for this purpose as it has the same\nstructure as PrO2 and the scattering cross-sections of Pr\nand Ce differ by only 10%. The estimated transmission of\nthe PrO2 and CeO2 samples was 93\u201397% (depending on\nE and Ei ), and the spectra were corrected accordingly.\nFig. 1(a) shows spectra of PrO2 and CeO2 with Ei =\n180 meV averaged over the angular ranges 9\u201319\u25e6 (h\u03c6i =\n14\u25e6 ) and 125\u2013139\u25e6 (h\u03c6i = 133\u25e6 ). At high angles the\nscattering is dominated by one-phonon processes, and\nso the 133\u25e6 data measures the phonon density of states\nweighted by the neutron cross-section of the atoms. The\n133\u25e6 data for the two compounds are similar except that\nsome PrO2 peaks are shifted to lower energies relative to\nCeO2 , most noticeably below 30 meV. At low angles more\nmarked differences are observed. The PrO2 data contains\na sharp peak at 131 meV and a broad peak centred on\n\u223c30 meV extending from 10 meV to 80 meV, whereas the\nCeO2 spectrum shows little structure and lies below the\nPrO2 spectrum at all energies. The 131 meV peak has\nbeen observed previously [2]. Both the broad and sharp\npeaks in the PrO2 data decrease in intensity with increasing Q consistent with a typical 4f magnetic form factor,\nand so we identify these features as magnetic in origin.\nConversely, the CeO2 signal systematically increases in\nintensity with Q, and this implies that the CeO2 scattering is non-magnetic as expected for a 4f 0 configuration\nwith no admixture of localized 4f 1 states.\nSeveral other magnetic features were observed in the\nPrO2 data in addition to those already described. The\nruns with Ei = 750 meV and 1200 meV detected two\nmore peaks. These are shown in Figs. 1(b) and (c). The\npeak centred near 350 meV in the 750 meV run is significantly broader than the resolution, whereas the peak\ncentred at 730 meV in the 1200 meV run is resolutionlimited. The 450 meV run revealed a shoulder of scattering above the 131 meV peak, centred at \u223c160 meV. This\nfeature is displayed in the inset to Fig. 1(d). Finally,\nthe Ei = 30 meV run revealed a peak centred at 3 meV\nshown in Fig. 1(d). This peak shifted to lower energies as\nthe temperature was raised, becoming quasielastic above\n\u223c15 K. Given that TN = 14 K we can confidently attribute this 3 meV peak to spin wave excitations of the\nantiferromagnetically ordered ground state. We found\nno evidence in our data for an excitation at 5.4 meV reported in a previous work [12], and so we conclude that\nthis feature is not intrinsic to PrO2 .\nFig. 1(d) shows data from several runs after correction\n\nfor the non-magnetic scattering and for the calculated\n(see below) magnetic form factor. The form factor correction extrapolates the data to zero Q and hence allows\ncomparison of runs with different incident energies.\nWe begin our interpretation of the results by considering the effect of the CEF. The splitting of a localized 4f 1\nconfiguration in a cubic CEF is described by the spinorbit coupling constant \u03b6, which sets the 2 F5/2 \u2192 2 F7/2\nseparation, and the fourth and sixth order CEF parameters B04 and B06 . Using the free ion value of \u03b6 for Pr4+\n[14] Kern et al [11] have calculated the energy levels as a\nfunction of the ratio B06 /B04 . They assigned the 131 meV\npeak to the \u03938 \u2192 \u03937 transition of 2 F5/2 , and by estimating the ratio B06 /B04 from a point charge model they\narrived at a parameterization of the CEF. Kern et al's\nmodel predicts the levels in the CEF-split 2 F7/2 term to\nbe \u223c320 meV (\u0393\u20326 ), \u223c390 meV (\u0393\u20328 ) and \u223c580 meV (\u0393\u20327 )\nabove the ground state in rough accord with the peaks\nin Figs. 1(b) and (c). We conclude, therefore, that these\nhigh energy peaks arise from the 2 F5/2 \u2192 2 F7/2 intermultiplet transitions, the only proviso being that the signal in\nFig. 1(b) must encompass both the \u0393\u20326 and \u0393\u20328 levels. Assuming this to be the case we refined the CEF model with\nthe 14 states |J; mJ i of 2 F5/2 and 2 F7/2 as a basis. With\nall 3 parameters allowed to vary independently the fitting procedure converged yielding B04 = (\u2212776 \u00b1 8) meV,\nB06 = (207 \u00b1 5) meV and \u03b6 = (100.5 \u00b1 1) meV [13] and\ngave excellent agreement with the observed energies.\nWith the eigenfunctions from the CEF refinement we\ncan now evaluate the cross-sections for the observed transitions as a function of Q. The formulae [10] contain\nradial moments of the 4f wavefunction, and values for\nPr4+ were taken from Ref. [15]. The curve in Fig. 1(b)\nrepresents the calculated cross-sections for the \u03938 \u2192 \u0393\u20326\nand \u03938 \u2192 \u0393\u20328 transitions, and the curve on Fig. 1(c) is\nlikewise for the \u03938 \u2192 \u0393\u20327 transition. Considering that no\nadditional parameters are needed to obtain the calculated\ncross-sections the level of agreement with the data is very\ngood. The same cannot be said, however, when the crosssections for the \u03938 \u2192 \u03938 and \u03938 \u2192 \u03937 transitions are calculated. At zero Q these are 182 and 99 mb sr\u22121 Pr\u22121 respectively [16], considerably greater than the integrated\nspectral weights 47 and 48 mb sr\u22121 Pr\u22121 in the 3 meV and\n131 meV peaks shown in Fig. 1(d) [17].\nWe will now describe a model that both accounts for\nthe puzzling intensities just mentioned and explains the\norigin of the 10\u201380 meV broad peak and the 160 meV\nshoulder. Our hypothesis is that these effects derive from\na strong coupling between 4f 1 electronic states and local\ndynamic lattice distortions. This coupling mixes electronic and phonon degrees of freedom and causes a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the \u03938 ground state.\nThe existence of a DJTE in PrO2 was in fact suggested some time ago to explain the factor \u223c2 reduction\nin ordered moment relative to a pure \u03938 ground state\n[2]. An analogous moment reduction in UO2 had already\n2\n\n\fbeen attributed to a DJTE [18], and so its occurrence\nin PrO2 would not be a surprise. Moreover, the neutron\ndata in Fig. 1(a) showing substantial phonon shifts in\nPrO2 relative to CeO2 provide direct evidence for a significant magnetoelastic interaction. To find out how this\ninteraction influences the magnetic excitation spectrum\nwe describe a simple model for the coupling of a set of\nCEF levels with phonons. Group theory shows that the\n\u03938 CEF ground state couples in first order to local distortions of either \u03933 or \u03935 symmetry, and point charge\ncalculations indicate that the coupling strengths are comparable [18]. For the sake of simplicity, however, we will\nrestrict our model to three degenerate local distortions\nof \u03935 symmetry with vibrational frequency \u03c9ph . We describe the magnetoelastic coupling with the Hamiltonian\nX\n(ai + a\u2020i )Oi ,\n(1)\nHME = g\n\nwe cannot expect a single-frequency model to match the\ndata perfectly. In reality there will be coupling to local\ndynamic distortions with \u03933 as well as \u03935 symmetry, and\nthese distortions will exist over a range of frequencies due\nto dispersion. The extent of the observed broad scattering is indicative that many frequencies are actually\ninvolved. A realistic model would also need to include\nstates with >1 phonons. Nevertheless, the qualitative\nagreement achieved with the present model is satisfying.\nBefore concluding we will address the nature of the f\nstates. Our analysis has assumed a localized 4f 1 configuration. We can check this assumption two ways. Firstly,\nwe can look for the signature of localized 4f 2 states in\nthe range 200\u2013300 meV where the 3 H4 \u2192 3 H5 transition\noccurs [19]. No peaks are observed. Second, we can directly determine the number of 4f 1 states per Pr from\nthe neutron cross-section via the sum rule for transitions\nwithin a J multiplet [10]. The measured zero-Q crosssection integrated up to 220 meV, including the elastic\nscattering [17], is 240 mb sr\u22121 Pr\u22121 . This compares with\nthe calculated value of 182 + 99 = 281 mb sr\u22121 Pr\u22121 for\nthe J = 52 multiplet [16]. Thus, by including the broad\nscattering in the integral we recover almost all the missing intensity. Allowing a 10% uncertainty in the absolute\ncalibration we conclude that 90 \u00b1 10% of the Pr ions have\na localized 4f 1 configuration. The intermultiplet transitions shown in Figs. 1(b) and (c) provide further support\nfor this conclusion since the calculated cross-sections for\n4f 1 are in good agreement with the measured intensities.\nIn summary, our findings support a tetravalent model\nfor PrO2 with an almost fully occupied atomic 4f orbital.\nThe neutron data allow the possibility of \u223c10% underoccupancy relative to a pure 4f 1 configuration, and this\nmay indicate a degree of covalency. Any other occupied\nstates of f symmetry must then be extended states in the\nO 2p valence band. These results rule out the strongly\nintermediate valence model for PrO2, and we anticipate\nthat a similar picture will apply to CeO2 and TbO2 . We\nfind compelling evidence that magnetoelastic coupling in\nPrO2 creates a ground state with mixed electronic and\nvibrational degrees of freedom by means of a DJTE. Being an insulator with a simple structure, localized f electrons and a large CEF splitting, PrO2 would seem an\nideal model system for further studies of the DJTE.\nWe thank Mike Hayward for help with sample preparation, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of Great Britain for financial support.\nP.S. thanks the Swiss NSF for financial support.\n\ni\n\nwhere g is the coupling constant, ai and a\u2020i are phonon\nannihilation and creation operators, and Oi are the \u03935\nsymmetry quadrupolar operators: O1 = (Jy Jz +Jz Jy )/2,\nO2 = (Jz Jx +Jx Jz )/2, and O3 = (Jx Jy +Jy Jx )/2. To investigate the ordered magnetic moment we also included\na molecular exchange field interaction HEx = H * J. The\nmagnitude of H was chosen so as to reproduce the observed 3 meV splitting of the ground state.\nWe take as a basis the 24 states |\u03c6n i, n = 1, . . . , 24,\nrepresented by |\u03938 ; 0i, |\u03937 ; 0i, |\u03938 ; 1(i) i, and |\u03937 ; 1(i) i.\nThese are products of the CEF eigenstates and the three\n\u03935 phonon modes (i = 1, 2, 3) containing either 0 or\n1 quanta h\u0304\u03c9ph . The energy separation \u2206 of |\u03938 ; 0i and\n|\u03937 ; 0i is chosen so as to reproduce the observed peak\nat 131 meV. The vibronic states are obtained by diagonalisation of the matrix h\u03c6n\u2032 |HME + HEx |\u03c6n i, and the\nmagnetic part of the neutron cross-section is calculated\nfrom the matrix elements of J.\nWe evaluated the model for a range of parameters.\nSmall values of h\u0304\u03c9ph are effective at mixing |\u03938 ; 0i and\n|\u03938 ; 1(i) i states creating a DJTE. The consequences are\na transfer of intensity from the ground state into the\nphonon-like states and a reduction in the ordered moment. A large h\u0304\u03c9ph tends to create vibronic states involving the \u03937 CEF excitation. To illustrate these effects we plot on Fig. 2 the zero-Q energy spectrum for\ntwo parameter sets, one (I) with small and the other (II)\nlarge h\u0304\u03c9ph . In both cases new peaks appear between the\n3 meV and 131 meV levels. With set I there is a factor\n0.86 reduction in the ordered moment (independent of\nthe direction of H) and a similar decrease in the intensity of the 3 meV peak. Set II produces a smaller effect on\nthe ordered moment and 3 meV peak, but a new feature\nis the signal above the 131 meV peak.\nThese results give us confidence that magnetoelastic\ncoupling is responsible for the unusual energy spectrum\nand reduced moment of PrO2.
