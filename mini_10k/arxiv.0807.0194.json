Introduction\n1D electron systems exhibit a number of peculiarities which destroy the familiar\nFermi-liquid behavior known from higher dimensions. Main reason is the geometrical restriction of the motion in 1D where electrons cannot avoid each other. As\na consequence excitations are plasmons similar to sound waves in solids. The corresponding phase is called a Luttinger liquid (LL) 1,2 . Renewed interest in LLs\narises from progress in manufacturing narrow quantum wires with a few or a single\nconducting channel. Examples are carbon nanotubes 3 , polydiacetylen 4 , quantum\nHall edges 5 and semiconductor cleave edge quantum wires 6 .\nFrom a theoretical point of view 1D quantum wires allow the investigation of\nthe interplay of interaction and disorder effects since short range interaction can\nbe treated already within a harmonic bosonic theory 7 . Central quantity is the\ninteraction parameter K which plays the role of a dimensionless conductance of a\nclean LL 8,1 . The effect of disorder on transport in LLs has been so far considered\nin two limiting cases:\n(i) The effect of a single impurity was considered in 8,9,10,11. Here the conduc1\n\n\fNovember 21, 2018 6:45 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nNattermann\n\nS. Malinin and T. Nattermann\n\ntance depends crucially on K. Impurities are irrelevant for attractive (K > 1) and\nstrongly relevant for repulsive interaction (K < 1), respectively. For finite voltage V\n2\nand K < 1, the conductance is \u223c V K \u22122 8 . These considerations can be extended\nto two impurities. Depending on the applied gate voltage, Coulomb blockade effects\nmay give rise to resonant tunneling 8,10 .\n(ii) In the opposite case of a finite density of weak impurities, (Gaussian) disorder is a relevant perturbation for K < 3/2 leading to the localization of electrons. For\n\u221a\nweak external electric field E the conductivity is highly nonlinear: \u03c3(E) \u223c e\u2212c/ E\n12,13,14,15 . At low but finite temperatures T this result goes over into the VRH\n\u221a\n\u2032\nexpression for the linear conductivity \u03c3 \u223c e\u2212c / T 13,14,15,16,17 . At higher temperatures there is a crossover to \u03c3 \u223c T 2\u22122K 18 .\nOn the contrary, much less is known in the case of a finite density of strong\npinning centers 19,2 which we will address in the present paper. In particular we\ndetermine both the temperature and electric field dependence of the (nonlinear)\nconductivity for this case in a broad temperature and electric field region. The\nmain results of the paper are the conductivities (5), (6), (7) and (8) as well as the\ncrossover behavior summarized in Fig. 1.\n2. Model and Instantons\nStarting point of our calculation is the action of interacting electrons subject to an\nexternal uniform electric field E and strong pinning centers. In bosonized form the\naction takes the form\n~\nS=\n2\u03c0K\n\nZL Z\u03bbT\n0\n\n0\n\nN\no\nn\nX\nu\u03b4(x \u2212 xi ) cos(2\u03c6 + 2kF xi ) (1)\ndxdy (\u2202y \u03c6)2 + (\u2202x \u03c6 + f x)2 \u2212\ni=1\n\nThe phase \u03c6(x) is related to the electron density \u03c1(x) = \u03c0 \u22121 (kF +\u2202x \u03c6)(1+2 cos(2\u03c6+\n2kF x)). kF is the Fermi wave vector, \u03c4 = y/v and f = F K/v~. v and \u03bbT = ~v/T\ndenote the plasmon velocity and the thermal de Broglie wave length, respectively.\nThe phase field between the impurities can now be easily integrated out leaving\nonly its values \u03c6(xi , y) \u2261 \u03c6i (y) at the impurity sites xi which are assumed to\nbe randomly distributed. The action can then be expressed in terms of Fourier\nP\ncomponents \u03c6i (y) = \u03bbT \u22121 \u03c9n \u03c6i,\u03c9n e\u2212i\u03c9n y , \u03c9n = 2\u03c0n/\u03bbT .

Since kF ai \u226b 1 below we will assume the\n\u03b1i to be random phases but keep the impurity distance ai approximately constant\nai \u2248 a.\n\n\fNovember 21, 2018 6:45 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nNattermann\n\nTransport in disordered Luttinger liquids\n\n3\n\nNext we consider the current resulting from tunneling processes between\nmetastable states, assuming strong pinning and weak quantum fluctuations, i.e.\nK \u226a 1. The tunneling process starts from a classical metastable configuration\n\u03c6\u0303i which minimizes the impurity potential for all values of y, E = 0. Hence\n\u03c6\u0303i = \u03c0(ni \u2212 \u03b1i ) where ni is integer. Among the many metastable states there\nP\nis one (modulo \u03c0) zero field ground state \u03c6\u03030i where ni = n0i = j\u2264i [\u2206\u03b1j\u22121 ]G 13 .\nHere \u2206\u03b1j = \u03b1j+1 \u2212 \u03b1j and [\u03b1]G denotes the closest integer to \u03b1. A new metastable\nstate follows from the ground state by adding integers qi = \u00b11 to the n0i .\nNext we consider an instanton configuration which connects the original state\n\u03c6\u0303i with the new state \u03c6\u0303i + \u03c0, ni depends in general on y. To be specific, we assume a\ndouble kink configuration for the instanton at each impurity site: \u03c6i (y) = \u03c6\u0303i +\u03c0 , for\n|y \u2212 yi | < Di \u2212 d, and \u03c6i (y) = \u03c6\u0303i , for |y \u2212 yi | > Di + d, with a linear interpolation\nbetween the two values at the kink walls in the regions |y \u2212 yi | \u2212 Di < d. yi \u00b1 Di\nis the kink/anti-kink position, d \u223c 1/u is the approximate width of the kinks and\n2Di their distance. It is plausible that in the saddle point configuration all yi will\nbe the same, an approximation we will use in the following. With zi = \u03c0Di /a the\ninstanton action can then be rewritten as\n(\n\u0015)\n\u0014\nzi\ncosh((zi+1 \u2212 zi )/2)\n2~ X \u2206\u03c6\u0303i\n2\n(3)\n(zi+1 \u2212 zi ) \u2212 f a zi + s + ln\ntanh cosh zi\nSI \u2248\nK i\n\u03c0\ncosh((zi+1 + zi )/2)\n2\nwhere the sum goes only over impurities with zi > 0. s is a constant that includes\nthe core action of a kink and an anti-kink: s = ln(Cau) \u226b 1, where ln C/K \u226b 1.\nFor a given initial metastable state {\u03c6\u0303i }, SI is a function of the variational\nparameters {Di ; i = 1, ..., N }. The nucleation rate \u0393 and hence the current I\nN R\nQ\ni\u221e\ndDk exp(\u2212S/~). Here we employ an approximate\nis given by I \u221d \u0393 \u221d\n0\ni=0\n\ntreatment in which we assume Di \u2261 D = az/\u03c0 for k < i \u2264 k + m and Di = 0\nelsewhere, i.e. tunneling is assumed to occur simultaneously through m neighboring\nimpurities. The instanton is then a rectangular object with extension ma and 2D\nin x and y direction, respectively. The instanton action can then be written as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0010\nz\nE\u0011\n2~\nz\u03c3m (k) + ln(1 + e\u22122z ) + m s + ln tanh \u2212 z\n.\n(4)\nSinst =\nK\n2\nEa\n\nHere we introduced the dimensionless field strength f a2 /\u03c0 = E/Ea where Ea\u0001 =\n1/(\u03baa2 ), \u03ba = K/\u03c0~v denotes the compressibility. \u03c3m (k) = \u03bdk (1) + \u03bdk+m (\u22121) /2\nplays the role of a surface tension\n\u0001 of the vertical boundaries of the instanton where\n\u03bdk (q) = q 2 \u2212 2q \u2206\u03b1k \u2212 [\u2206\u03b1k ]G . In the ground state \u03c3m (k) is equally distributed\nin the interval 0 \u2264 \u03c3m (k) < 2 14 . The second and the third contribution in (4)\nresult from the horizontal boundaries of the instanton and include their surface\ntension s/a and their attractive interaction. The last term describes the volume\ncontribution resulting from the external field.\nIn addition, we have to include a small dissipative term Sbath = 2~\nK m\u03b7 ln z ,\n\u03b7 \u226a 1, in the action in order to allow for energy dissipation 14 . However, we will\n\n\fNovember 21, 2018 6:45 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\nNattermann\n\nS. Malinin and T. Nattermann\n\nomit \u03b7-dependent terms in all results where they give only small corrections (apart\nfrom possible pre-exponential factors which we do not consider).\nA necessary condition for tunneling is \u2202Sinst /\u2202z < 0 for z \u2192 \u221e, i.e. \u03c3m (k) <\nmEa /E. The tunneling probability follows from the saddle point value of the instanm\nton action where z fulfils the condition \u03c3m (k) \u2212 m EEa + tanh z \u2212 1 + mz\u03b7 + sinh\nz = 0.\n3. Results and Conclusions\nWe discuss now several special cases: (i) For sufficiently large fields E \u226b Ea\nthe saddle point is zs \u2248 EEa \u226a 1 which gives a tunneling probability \u0393 \u221d\n2m\n(E/Ea ) K \u22121 e\u22122ms/K . The exponent \u22121 results from the integration around the saddle point. Because of small K and correspondingly large kink core action, tunneling\nthrough single impurities (m = 1) is preferred and hence the nonlinear conductivity\nis given by\n2\n\n\u03c3(E) \u223c (E/Ea ) K\n\n\u22122 \u22122s/K\n\ne\n\n,\n\nEa < E < E1,cr = Ea es ,\n\n(5)\n\nin agreement with previous results for tunneling through a single weak link 8 if we\nidentify e\u2212s/K \u223c t with the hopping amplitude t through the link. The upper field\nstrength for the validity of this result can be estimated from Ds u \u2261 zs au < 1 since\nthe instantons loose then their meaning. Using u \u2192 ueff \u2248 kF (u/kF )1/(1\u2212K) we\nfind E1,cr \u223c (kF /e\u03baa)(u/kF )1/(1\u2212K) , which can be also read off directly from (5)\nas E1,cr \u223c Ea es . Classically (K = 0), E1,cr corresponds to the case when the field\nenergy Ea the electron gains by moving to the next impurity is smaller than the\npinning energy u/\u03ba.\nAt finite temperatures there is a crossover to a temperature T \u2248 EaK dependent\nconductivity\n\u03c3(T, E) \u221d\n\n\u0012\n\nT\nTa\n\n\u0013 K2 \u22122\n\ne\u22122s/K sinh(\n\nEa T\n)\n,\nT Ea\n\nEKa < T < T1,cr = Ta es\n\n(6)\n\nwhen the instanton extension 2Ds reaches \u03bbT , i.e. for E < Ea T /Ta. For temperatures higher than T1,cr isolated impurities are weak. Following the arguments of 19\none expects in this region \u03c3 \u223c T 2\u22122K .\n(ii) In the opposite case of weak fields, E \u226a Ea , tunneling happens simultaneously through many impurities and the saddle point is zs \u226b 1. In this case we can\nestimate the typical surface tension as \u03c3k (m) \u2248 1/m for a chosen pair of sites k and\nk + m, respectively 14 . For very large values\np of m we can treat m as continuous\nand the saddle point condition gives ms \u2248 Ea /E \u226b 1 and zs \u2248 sEa /(2E).

To be more realistic we have to take\ninto account the randomness of the impurity distances ai such that decreasing the\nfield (or the temperature), the current jumps by a factor \u223c e\u22122am /\u03beloc . Clearly, for\nlong wires these jumps will average out.\nFinally, we briefly compare the present case of Poissonian strong disorder,\nueff a \u226b 1 with the Gaussian weak disorder, ueff a \u226a 1 considered in 10,13,14,18 .\nIn the latter case u and a are sent simultaneously to zero but the quantity\nu2 /a \u223c \u03be0\u22123 \u226a kF3 is assumed to be finite, \u03be0 denotes the bare correlation length.\nFluctuations on scales smaller than \u03be0 renormalize \u03be0 \u2192 \u03be \u223c kF\u22121 (\u03be0 kF )3/(3\u22122K) . At\nlow T the conductivity is of variable range hopping type (8) up to a temperature\nTloc = ~v/\u03be = Ta (u/uc )2/(3\u22122K) where uc \u2248 kF (akF )K\u22121 . For higher T there is a\ndirect crossover to \u03c3 \u223c T 2\u22122K(T ) where K is now renormalized by disorder fluctuations 18,19 .
