We also discuss constraints on the model parameter space arising from\ncurrent experimental upper limits on lepton flavor violating decays.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLeptogenesis [1, 2] (for a comprehensive review see ref. [3]) is a theoretical mechanism\nthat can explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. An\ninitial lepton asymmetry, generated in the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy singlet\nMajorana neutrinos, is partially converted in a baryon asymmetry by anomalous\nsphaleron interactions [4] that are standard model (SM) processes. Heavy Majorana\nsinglet neutrinos are also a fundamental ingredient of the seesaw model [5], that\nprovides an elegant explanation for the suppression of the neutrino masses with\nrespect to all other SM mass scales. Leptogenesis can be quantitatively successful\nwith a neutrino mass scale of the order of the atmospheric neutrino mass squared\ndifference. This remarkable 'coincidence' links nicely the explanation of neutrino\nmasses and of the baryon asymmetry within a single framework, and renders the\nidea that baryogenesis occurred through leptogenesis a very attractive one.\nIn the standard seesaw case, computations of the CP violating (CPV) asymmetries \u01ebN\u03b1 in the decays of the N\u03b1 singlet neutrinos include loop diagrams in which\nMajorana states appear in the internal lines [6], and thus are lepton number violating quantities [7]. This is the reason why leptogenesis can proceed even when it\nis assumed that only one lepton flavor is relevant, as is the case at large tempera12\n12\ntures (T >\n\u223c 10 GeV). However, at temperatures below \u223c 10 GeV, lepton flavor\ndynamics plays an important role in leptogenesis, and cannot be neglected [8, 9]\n(See [10, 11] for earlier studies of flavor effects in leptogenesis, and [3, 12] for recent\nreviews). In particular, in ref. [9] it was pointed out that leptogenesis can occur\neven when \u01ebN\u03b1 = 0, provided that the individual flavored CPV asymmetries \u01ebN\u03b1 \u2192Lj\n(with j = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) areP\nnon vanishing.\nOf course, \u01ebN\u03b1 = j \u01ebN\u03b1 \u2192Lj = 0 means that total lepton number is not violated\nin N\u03b1 decays. The reason why leptogenesis can still occur even in this case can be\nunderstood by analogy with the generation of a baryon asymmetry \u2206B = B \u2212 B\u0304\nfrom a lepton asymmetry \u2206L = L \u2212 L\u0304 that, as is well known, does not require\nany baryon number violating CP asymmetry. Baryon number, or more precisely\n\u2206B + \u2206L, is in fact violated in the plasma by fast sphaleron reactions, with the\nresult that part of \u2206L is converted in \u2206B yielding a ratio \u2206B/\u2206L = \u221228/51.\nSimilarly, at T \u223c MN\u03b1 various interactions that are lepton and lepton flavor\nnumber violating occur in the plasma, like for example \u03a6lj \u2194 N\u03b1 \u2194 \u03a6\u0304l\u0304k . Of course,\nthese reactions must be at least slightly out-of-equilibrium, otherwise they would\nquickly drive the individual \u2206Lj \u2192 0. However, the important point here is that\ngenerically these (washout) reactions proceed with different rates for different lepton\nflavors, erasing more efficiently, say, \u2206L\u03c4 than \u2206Le,\u03bc . As a result, at T \u226a MN1\n(N1 being the lightest heavy Majorana\nneutrino), once all washout processes are\nP\nswitched off, quite generically j \u2206Lj = \u2206L 6= 0 results. This scenario, in which\nleptogenesis can proceed solely because of flavor effects, is what we call Purely\nFlavored Leptogenesis (PFL). It is worth noticing that PFL realizes the Sakharov\n1\n\n\fconditions [13] in a slightly different way that standard leptogenesis, since violation\nof lepton number occurs only in the washouts, while CP is violated only in the flavor\ncharges, and the two conditions are thus disentangled.\nRef. [14] analyzed the issue of the interplay between the lepton number breaking\nscale and the breaking scale of a flavor symmetry (of the Froggatt-Nielsen type [15]).\nIt was found that in the case when the flavor symmetry is still unbroken during the\nleptogenesis era, but the vectorlike messengers masses are larger than the Majorana\nneutrino mass, the total CP asymmetry vanishes and a PFL scenario arises. In this\npaper we show that the PFL model of ref. [14] can indeed succeed in producing the\ncosmological baryon asymmetry. Interestingly, in this model there is an upper limit\non the leptogenesis temperature fixed by the requirement that leptogenesis must\n12\noccur in the flavored regime (T <\n\u223c 10 GeV) but, differently from the standard case,\nthere is no lower limit and, as we will show, leptogenesis can be successful at a scale\nas low as the TeV.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we recall the main\nfeatures of the model, we give the expressions for the flavor CPV asymmetries and\nwe discuss an important rescaling property of the CPV asymmetries that leaves\nunaffected the washout rates. In section 3 we write down the Boltzmann Equations\n(BE) for the model and we present the main results. In section 5 we study some\nrelations between the flavor violating parameters of the model and the low energy\nlimits on lepton flavor violating processes.\nIn our model washout and asymmetries in decays and scatterings occur at the\nsame order in the couplings, and thus the derivation of the BE differs from the\nstandard case in a non-trivial way. In appendix A we present a detailed derivation\nof the BE, that relies on the formalism introduced in ref. [16] to deal in a proper way\nwith CPV asymmetries in scatterings. In appendix B we collect some definitions\nand useful formulae.\n\n2\n\nThe Model\n\nThe model we consider here [14] is a simple extension of the SM containing a set\nof SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y fermion singlets, namely three right-handed neutrinos (N\u03b1 =\nc\nN\u03b1R + N\u03b1R\n) and three heavy vectorlike fields (Fa = FaL + FaR ). In addition, we\nassume that at some high energy scale, taken to be of the order of the leptogenesis\nscale MN1 , an exact U(1)X horizontal symmetry forbids direct couplings of the\nlepton li and Higgs \u03a6 doublets to the heavy Majorana neutrinos N\u03b1 . At lower\nenergies, U(1)X gets spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value \u03c3 of\na SU(2)L singlet scalar field S. Accordingly, the Yukawa interactions of the high\nenergy Lagrangian read\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 LY = N\u0304\u03b1 MN\u03b1 N\u03b1 + F\u0304a MFa Fa + hia l\u0304i PR Fa \u03a6 + N\u0304\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1a + \u03bb(5)\n\u03b1a \u03b35 Fa S + h.c. (1)\n2\n2\n\n\fh\u03a6i\n\n\u03bd\n\nhSi\n\n\u00d7\nMF\n\nhSi\n\n\u00d7\nMN\n\nh\u03a6i\n\n\u00d7\nMF\n\n\u03bd\n\nFigure 1: Effective seesaw operator for the light neutrino masses\nWe use Greek indices \u03b1, \u03b2 * * * = 1, 2, 3 to label the heavy Majorana neutrinos, Latin\nindices a, b * * * = 1, 2, 3 for the vectorlike messengers, and i, j, k, . . . for the lepton\nflavors e, \u03bc, \u03c4 . Following reference [14] we chose the simple U(1)X charge assignments\nX(lLi , FLa , FRa ) = +1, X(S) = \u22121 and X(N\u03b1 , \u03a6) = 0. This assignment is sufficient\nto enforce the absence of N\u0304l\u03a6 terms, but clearly it does not constitute an attempt\nto reproduce the fermion mass pattern, and accordingly we will also avoid assigning\nspecific charges to the right-handed leptons and quark fields that have no relevance\nfor our analysis. The important point is that it is likely that any flavor symmetry\n(of the Froggatt-Nielsen type) will forbid the the same tree-level couplings, and\nwill reproduce an overall model structure similar to the one we are assuming here.\nTherefore we believe that our results, that are focused on a new realization of the\nleptogenesis mechanism, can hint to a general possibility that could well occur also\nin a complete model of flavor.\nAs it was discussed in [14], depending on the hierarchy between the relevant\nscales of the model (MN1 , MFa , \u03c3), quite different scenarios for leptogenesis can\narise. PFL arises when the relevant scales satisfy the hierarchy \u03c3 < MN1 < MFa\nthat is, when the flavor symmetry U(1)X is still unbroken during the leptogenesis\nera and at the same time the messengers Fa are too heavy to be produced in N1\ndecays and scatterings, and can be integrated away. As is explicitely shown by\nthe last term in eq. (1), in general the vectorlike fields can couple to the heavy\nsinglet neutrinos via scalar and pseudoscalar couplings, In ref. [14] it was assumed\nfor simplicity a strong hierarchy \u03bb \u226b \u03bb(5) which allowed us to neglect all the \u03bb(5) .\nHowever, in all the relevant quantities (scatterings, CP asymmetries, light neutrino\nmasses) at leading order the scalar and pseudoscalar couplings always appear in the\ncombination \u03bb+\u03bb(5) , and thus such an assumption is not necessary. The replacement\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb + \u03bb(5) would suffice to include in the analysis the effects of both type of\ninteractions.\n\n2.1\n\nExtended seesaw and light neutrino masses\n\nAfter U(1)X and electroweak symmetry breaking the Lagrangian eq. (1) generates\nmasses for the light neutrinos through the effective mass operator depicted in fig-\n\n3\n\n\fure 1.

However, via off-shell exchange of the\nheavy Fa fields, N1 can decay to the three body final states S\u03a6l and S\u0304 \u03a6\u0304 \u0304l. The\ncorresponding Feynman diagram is depicted in figure 2(a). At leading order in\nra = MN1 /MFa , the total decay width reads [14]\n\u00132\n\u0012\nX\nMN1 MN1\n \u0304\n(\u03bb\u0303\u03bb\u0303\u2020 )11 .\n(4)\n\u0393 N1 \u2261\n\u0393(N1 \u2192 S\u03a6lj + S\u0304 \u03a6\u0304lj ) =\n3\n192\u03c0\n\u03c3\nj\nAs usual, CPV asymmetries in N1 decays arise from the interference between\ntree-level and one-loop amplitudes. As was noted in [14], in this model at one-loop\nthere are no contributions from vertex corrections, and the only contribution to\nthe CPV asymmetries comes from the self-energy diagram 2(b). Summing over the\nleptons and vectorlike fields running in the loop, at leading order in ra the CPV\nasymmetry for N1 decays into leptons of flavor j can be written as\nh\ni\n\u0001\nP\n2 \u2020\n\u2217\nhr h mj \u03bb\u03031m \u03bb\u03031j\nm Im\n3\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u01eb1j \u2261 \u01ebN1 \u2192lj =\n.\n(5)\n128\u03c0\n\u03bb\u0303\u03bb\u0303\u2020\n11\n\nNote that since the loop correction does not violate lepton number, the total CPV\nasymmetry that is obtained\nP by summing over the flavor of the final state leptons\nvanishes [7], that is \u01eb1 \u2261 j \u01eb1j = 0. This is the condition that defines PFL; namely\nthere is no CPV and lepton number violating asymmetry, and the CPV lepton flavor\nasymmetries are the only seed of the Cosmological lepton and baryon asymmetries.\nIt is important to note that the effective couplings \u03bb\u0303 defined in eq. (3) are invariant under the reparameterization\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb * (rU)\u22121 ,\n\nh\u2020 \u2192 (Ur) * h\u2020 ,\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u03a6\n\nS\n\n\u03a6\n\nS\nlm\n\nN1\n\nFa\n\nN1\n\nlj\n\nFb\n\nFa\u2032\n\n(a)\n\nlj\n\n\u03a6\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: Feynman diagrams responsible for the CPV asymmetry.\nwhere U is an arbitrary 3 \u00d7 3 non-singular matrix. Clearly the light neutrino mass\nmatrix is invariant under this transformation. Moreover, also the flavor dependent washout processes, that correspond to tree level amplitudes that are determined, to a good approximation, by the effective \u03bb\u0303 couplings, are left essentially\nunchanged.1 On the contrary, the flavor CPV asymmetries eq. (5), that are determined by loop amplitudes containing an additional factor of hr 2 h\u2020 , get rescaled as\nhr 2 h\u2020 \u2192 h(rUr)\u2020 (rUr)h\u2020 . Clearly, this rescaling affects in the same way\nP all the\nlepton flavors (as it should be to guarantee that the PFL conditions \u01eb\u03b1 \u2261\n\u01eb\u03b1j = 0\nare not spoiled), and thus for simplicity we will consider only rescaling by a global\nscalar factor r.U = U.r = \u03ba I (with I the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix) that, for our purposes, is completely equivalent to the more general transformation (6). Thus, while\nrescaling the Yukawa couplings through\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb \u03ba\u22121 ,\n\nh\u2020 \u2192 \u03ba h\u2020 ,\n\n(7)\n\ndoes not affect neither low energy neutrino physics nor the washout processes, the\nCPV asymmetries get rescaled as:\n\u01eb1j \u2192 \u03ba2 \u01eb1j .\n\n(8)\n\nBy choosing \u03ba > 1, all the CPV asymmetries get enhanced as \u03ba2 and, being the\nCosmological asymmetries generated through leptogenesis linear in the CPV asymmetries, the final result gets enhanced by the same factor. Therefore, for any given\nset of couplings, one can always find an appropriate rescaling such that the correct\namount of Cosmological lepton asymmetry is generated. In practice, the rescaling\nfactors \u03ba cannot be arbitrarily large: first, they should respect the condition that\nall the fundamental Yukawa couplings remain in the perturbative regime; second,\nas will be discussed in section 5, the size of the h couplings (and thus also of the\nrescaling parameter \u03ba) is also constrained by experimental limits on lepton flavor\nviolating decays.\n1\n\nThe approximation is exact in the limit of pointlike F -propagators (s \u2212 MF2 + iMF \u0393F ) \u2192 MF2 .\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nBoltzmann Equations\n\nIn this section we compute the lepton asymmetry by solving the appropriate BE. In\ngeneral, to consistently derive the evolution equation of the lepton asymmetry all\nthe possible processes at a given order in the couplings have to be included. In the\npresent case 1 \u2194 3 decays and inverse decays, and 2 \u2194 2 s, t and u channel scatterings all occur at the same order in the couplings and must be included altogether in\nthe BE. The Feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in Figure 3. In addition, the CPV asymmetries of some higher order multiparticle reactions involving\nthe exchange of one off-shell N1 , also contribute to the source term of the asymmetries at the same order in the couplings than the CPV asymmetries of decays and\n2 \u2194 2 scatterings. More precisely, for a proper derivation of the BE it is essential\nthat the CPV asymmetries of the off-shell 3 \u2194 3 and 2 \u2194 4 scattering processes\ndepicted in figures 7, and 8 in appendix A, are also taken into account. In order\nto do this, we follow Ref. [16] and we split the BE for the evolution of the density\nasymmetry of the flavor li as:\nsub\n\u1e8e\u2206Li = (\u1e8e\u2206Li )1\u21943 + (\u1e8e\u2206Li )2\u21942 + (\u1e8e\u2206Li )sub\n3\u21943 + (\u1e8e\u2206Li )2\u21944 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Y\u2206Li = (nli \u2212 nl\u0304i )/s with nli (nl\u0304i ) the number density of li (anti)leptons,\nand s the entropy density. The time derivative is defined as \u1e8e \u2261 s H z dY /dz where\nz = MN1 /T and H is the Hubble parameter. The first term on the r.h.s. of eq. (9)\nrepresents the contribution of three body decays and inverse decays, the second term\nthat of 2 \u2194 2 scatterings, the third term is defined in terms of the off-shell (pole\nsub\non-shell\nsubtracted) 3 \u2194 3 multiparticle density rates \u03b33\u21943\n= \u03b33\u21943 \u2212 \u03b33\u21943\n, and similarly\nfor the fourth term. The BE for Y\u2206li is derived by taking into account in full the first\ntwo terms on the r.h.s., while for the remaining two terms only the corresponding\nCP asymmetry is important, since non-resonant contributions to the washouts from\nmultiparticle processes are always negligible.\nAs regards the equation for the evolution of the heavy neutrino density YN1 , only\nthe diagrams in fig. 3, that are of leading order in the couplings, are important. We\nrefer to appendix A for a detailed derivation of the equations.

The example presented is a general one. No particular choice of the\nparameters has been performed, except for the fact that the low energy neutrino\ndata are reproduced within errors, and that the choice yields an interesting washout\ndynamics well suited to illustrate how PFL works. The numerical value of the final\nlepton asymmetry (Y\u2206L \u223c \u22125.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 ) is about a factor of 3 larger than what is\nindicated by measurements of the Cosmic baryon asymmetry. This is however irrelevant since, as was discussed in section 2., it would be sufficient a minor rescaling\nof the couplings (or a slight change in the CPV phases) to obtain the precise experimental result. In the numerical analysis we have neglected the dynamics of the\nheavier singlet neutrinos since the N\u03b1 masses are sufficiently hierarchical to ensure\nthat N2,3 related washouts do not interfere with N1 dynamics. Moreover, in the\n(strong washout) fully flavored regime (that is effective as long as T < 109 GeV) the\nN2,3 CPV asymmetries do not contribute to the final lepton number asymmetry [18].\nIn figure 4 we show the behavior of the various reaction densities for decays\nand scatterings, normalized to sHz, as a function of z = MN1 /T .

Left panel: \u03c4 flavor.\nRight panel: electron flavor.\nheavier neutrino masses are MN2 = 10 TeV and MN3 = 15 TeV, and the relevant\nmass ratios ra = MN1 /MFa for the messenger fields are r1,2,3 = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 (the\neffects of the lightest F resonances can be seen in the s-channel rates in both panels\nin fig. 4). The fundamental Yukawa couplings h and \u03bb are chosen to satisfy the\nrequirement that the seesaw formula eq. (2) reproduces within 2 \u03c3 the low energy\ndata on the neutrino mass squared differences and mixing angles [19]. Typically,\nwhen this requirement is fulfilled, one also ends up with a dynamics for all the\nlepton flavors in the strong washout regime. This is shown in the left panel in fig. 5\nwhere we present the total rates for the three flavors.\nThe left panel in fig. 4 refers to the decay and scattering rates involving the\n\u03c4 -flavor that, in our example, is the flavor more strongly coupled to N1 , and that\nthus suffers the strongest washout. It is worth noticing that, due to the fact that\nin this model scatterings are not suppressed by additional coupling constants with\nrespect to the decays, the decay rate starts dominating the washouts only at z >\n\u223c 1.\nThe right panel in fig. 4 depicts the reaction rates for the electron flavor, that is\nthe more weakly coupled, and for which the strong washout condition eq. (14) is\nessentially ensured by sizeable s-channel scatterings. Scatterings and decay rates\nfor the \u03bc-flavor are not shown, but they are in between the ones of the previous two\nflavors.\nThe total reaction densities that determine the washout rates for the different\nflavors are shown in the first panel in figure 5. The evolution of these rates with z\nshould be confronted with the evolution of (the absolute value of) the asymmetry\ndensities for each flavor, depicted in the second panel on the right. Since, as already\nstressed several times, PFL is defined by the condition that the sum of the flavor\n8\n\n\fP\nCPV asymmetry vanishes ( j \u01eb1j = 0), it is the hierarchy between these washout\nrates that in the end is the responsible for generating a net lepton number asymmetry. In the case at hand, the absolute values of the flavor CPV asymmetries satisfy\nthe condition |\u01eb\u03bc | < |\u01ebe | < |\u01eb\u03c4 |, as can be inferred directly by the fact that at z < 0.1,\nwhen the effects of the washouts are still negligible, the asymmetry densities satisfy\nthis hierarchy. Moreover, since \u01eb\u03bc,e < 0 while \u01eb\u03c4 > 0, initially the total lepton number asymmetry, that is dominated by Y\u2206L\u03c4 , is positive. As washout effects become\nimportant, the \u03c4 -related reactions (blue dotted line in the left panel) start erasing\nY\u2206L\u03c4 more efficiently than what happens for the other two flavors, and thus the initial positive asymmetry is driven towards zero, and eventually changes sign around\nz = 0.2. This change of sign corresponds to the steep valley in the absolute value\n|Y\u2206L | that is drawn in the figure with a black solid line. Note that when all flavors\nare in the strong washout regime, as in the present case, the\n\u0010 condition\u0011for the occur2\nrence of this 'sign inversions' is simply given by maxj\u2208e,\u03bc |\u01ebj |/|\u03bb\u03031j |2 >\n\u223c \u01eb\u03c4 /|\u03bb\u03031\u03c4 | .\nFrom this point onwards, the asymmetry remains negative, and since the electron\nflavor is the one that suffers the weakest washout, Y\u2206Le ends up dominating all the\nother density asymmetries. In fact, as can be seen from the right panel in fig. 5, it\nis Y\u2206Le that determines to a large extent the final value of the lepton asymmetry\nY\u2206L = \u22125.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\nA few comments are in order regarding the role played by the Fa fields. Even\nif MN1 \u226a MFa , at large temperatures z \u226b 1 the tail of the thermal distributions\nof the N1 , S and \u03a6 particles allows the on-shell production of the lightest F states.\nA possible asymmetry generated in the decays of the F fields can be ignored for\ntwo reasons: first because due to the rather large h and \u03bb couplings F decays\noccur to a good approximation in thermal equilibrium, ensuring that no sizeable\nasymmetry can be generated, and second because the strong washout dynamics\nthat characterizes N1 leptogenesis at lower temperatures is in any case insensitive\nto changes in the initial conditions.\nIn conclusion, it is clear from the results of this section that the model encounters\nno difficulties to allow for the possibility of generating the Cosmic baryon asymmetry\nat a scale of a few TeVs. Moreover, our analysis provides a concrete example of\nPFL, and shows that the condition \u01eb1 6= 0 is by no means required for successful\nleptogenesis.\n\n5\n\nLepton Flavor Violating Decays\n\nWe have seen that a particular feature of this model is that the rescaling of the\ncouplings eq. (7) can enhance the CPV asymmetry by a factor \u03ba2 (see eq. (8))\nwithout affecting neither the low energy neutrino physics nor the washout rates.\nIn practice, it is this decoupling of the CPV asymmetries from the washouts that\nrenders possible lowering the leptogenesis scale down to the TeV.

To this aim, in this section we will derive upper bounds on the Yukawa\ncouplings hia from the non-observation of Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays.\nThe set of Yukawa interactions involving the heavy vectorlike fields Fa , the SU(2)\nHiggs scalar \u03a6 and lepton doublets li , can induce lepton flavor violating radiative\ndecays li \u2192 lj \u03b3. Here we will concentrate on \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 that is the most constrained\nprocess. Note that, with respect to the radiative decays, lepton flavor violating\ndecays like l\u2032 \u2192 3l are more suppressed since they are induced by box diagrams\nrather then by penguin-type diagrams.

In fact, as is\nshown in fig. 6, for MF > a few TeVs and Yukawa couplings <\n\u223c .5, the radiative\nLFV decay rates always remain far below the present limits. Only for h >\n\u223c 2 (that\nis close to the perturbative limit represented by the hatched region in fig. 6) and\nMF1 \u223c 25 TeV (that was our choice in the numerical example) the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 decay\nrate becomes comparable to the present sensitivity, and is well within the reach of\nfuture experiments [20]. Thus we can safely conclude that present limits on LFV\ndecays do not place any serious constraint on the viability of TeV scale leptogenesis\nwithin the PFL model discussed in this paper.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nVariations of the standard leptogenesis scenario can arise from the presence of additional (flavor) symmetries broken around or below the scale at which lepton number\nis effectively broken. Quite generically, the resulting scenarios can yield new qualitative and quantitative changes on the way leptogenesis is realized. Here we have\nconsidered a model in which an Abelian U(1)X flavor symmetry, still unbroken during the leptogenesis era, is added to the SM gauge symmetry group. We have also\nassumed that the messengers fields responsible for the effective mass operators of the\nlight particles are heavier that the lightest Majorana neutrino N1 and thus, during\n\n11\n\n\fleptogenesis, cannot be produced. The model has the remarkable feature that the\ntotal CPV asymmetry in N1 decays vanishes, while the lepton flavor asymmetries\nare generically nonvanishing, and thus it constitutes an explicit realization of the\nscenario that we have called purely flavored leptogenesis.\nBy using the BE specific for this model, we have studied the evolution of the\nasymmetry densities for the different lepton flavors as the temperature changes,\nand we have found that successful leptogenesis can occur at a scale as low as a\nfew TeVs. This possibility is due to the fact that the size of the flavored CPV\nasymmetries is decoupled from the strength of the washouts and from low energy\nneutrino physics. This allows to rescale the CPV asymmetries up to rather large\nvalues, leaving unaffected the washout rates as well as the light neutrino masses and\nmixings. Our model shows that if new unbroken symmetries are present at a scale\nbelow the leptogenesis scale, this could have a very interesting and even surprising\nimpact on the way leptogenesis is realized.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nLAM would like to thank short term training fellowships from the EU HELEN\nprogram and hospitality from the INFN-LNF Theory Group in Frascati (Rome).\nThe work of EN is supported in part by Colciencias under contract 1115-333-18739.\n\nA\n\nBoltzmann Equations\n\nFollowing mainly ref.

In order to get the correct result we need to include in the\nBE also the CPV asymmetries of higher order processes, like the 3 \u2194 3 and 2 \u2194 4\nscatterings in which one N1 is exchanged as a virtual state in the internal lines. This\nis carried out in the following two sections.\n\nA.2\n\n3 \u2194 3 processes\n\nMultiparticle tree level processes in which one N1 is exchanged in one internal line\ncan be divided into on-shell and off-shell parts. For the on-shell parts, when the N1\nline in the amplitude is cut, we obtain either the 1 \u2194 3 or the 2 \u2194 2 diagrams in\nfig. 3 which were already accounted for in eq. (22). We then have to consider only\nthe off-shell contributions, denoted as \u03b3 \u2032 , where the superscript is a reminder that\nthe given reaction has the on-shell piece subtracted out. The contribution of these\noff-shell processes to the washouts is negligible; however, the contribution of their\nCPV asymmetries cannot be neglected.
