Gensemer\nVan der Waals-Zeeman Instituut, Universiteit van Amsterdam,\nValckenierstraat 65, 1018 XE Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nWe propose an experimental method that allows for scaling of all the diagonal correlation functions\n(such as the density and pair correlation function) during the expansion of harmonically trapped\ncold atomic gases with arbitrary interactions even if the trapping is anisotropic. To do this we\nrequire that the interaction be tunable by the use of a Feshbach resonance and that the trapping\npotential can be manipulated independently along the axial and radial directions. This permits a\nmuch greater accuracy and resolution in measurements of correlation functions. We explain the\nexplicit control procedure, outline the scaling ansatz that we use and briefly discuss the systems\nwhere it could be applied as well as possible experimental obstacles to its implementation.\nPACS numbers:\n\nHow can we measure correlation functions in harmonically trapped cold atomic gases? In order to measure\nthem with good accuracy, the trapped gas is first allowed to expand ballistically to improve optical resolution and reduce its optical depth. However the interactions present in the gas can in principle modify the\ncorrelation functions significantly during the expansion\nand it is far from obvious how to relate the measured\nvalues after expansion to those that existed in the trap\nbefore the expansion [1]. Here we propose a new experimental method whereby the release from the trap of an\ninteracting gas is accomplished in such a way that correlation functions exhibit scaling during the expansion,\nand therefore their initial values can be measured with\ngreat accuracy. We shall not discuss the off-diagonal correlation functions such as the one-body density matrix\nh\u03c8 \u2020 (r)\u03c8(r\u2032 )i with r 6= r\u2032 . However the present method is\napplicable to all real space diagonal correlation functions.\nIn most experiments that measure the density n(r),\nthe atomic gas is allowed to expand and, when it is large\nenough for a satisfactory optical resolution, it is imaged\ndestructively. In many cases (e.g. for ideal gases or interacting ones in the Thomas-Fermi limit), the density\nafter expansion is then related to the one before expansion using scaling transformations [2, 3]. By scaling we\nmean a coordinate transformation of the kind:\nx \u2192 \u03bbx (t)x, y \u2192 \u03bby (t)y, z \u2192 \u03bbz (t)z\n\n(1)\n\nsuch that the density at a time t after release from the\ntrap can be written in terms of the density at t = 0:\nn(r, t) = \u03b1n0 (x/\u03bbx , y/\u03bby , z/\u03bbz )\n\n(2)\n\nThe \u03bbi (t) are known as scaling functions and \u03b1 =\n(\u03bbx \u03bby \u03bbz )\u22121 is a time dependent normalization factor.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: clobo@science.unitn.it\n\nWhile the density gives us very important information\nabout such things as thermodynamic properties and collective oscillations, it does not reveal all the many-body\naspects of the system. In fact we can probe new physics\nby looking at other quantities such as the pair correlation\nfunction which is defined as:\ng (2) (r1 , r2 , t) =\n\nn(2) (r1 , r2 , t)\nn(r1 , t)n(r2 , t)\n\n(3)\n\nwith\nn(2) (r1 , r2 , t) = h\u03c8 \u2020 (r1 , t)\u03c8 \u2020 (r2 , t)\u03c8(r2 , t)\u03c8(r1 , t)i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the \u03c8 are atomic field operators. The pair correlation function g(r1 , r2 ) is related to the probability of\nfinding an atom at r2 given that there is an atom at r1 .\nIf there is more than one spin species present (as in the\ncase of the superfluid Fermi gas) then we can consider\nalso the opposite spin pair correlation function (see e.g.\n[10]) where the atoms at r1 and r2 are in different spin\nstates. The pair correlation function has been the subject\nof recent experimental studies [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] while others\nhave focussed on correlations in momentum space [8, 9].\nThe pair correlation function can reveal new physics that\nis not measured by the density. For example, it can reveal the \"bunching\" of thermal bosons [6], a phenomenon\nwhich is also predicted to occur in the unitary Fermi superfluid [10]. The difficulty with measuring g (2) (r1 , r2 ) is\nthat it has important features at small values of |r1 \u2212 r2 |,\nsometimes comparable to the interatomic distance. This\nrequires very good optical resolution which usually can\nonly be achieved through an expansion of the gas.\nThis leads us naturally to the following question: as far\nas real-space correlation functions are concerned (such as\nthe density or the pair correlation function), to what extent can they be faithfully preserved during the expansion in such a way that a subsequent measurement will be\nable to recover the values that existed in the trap prior to\nthe expansion? For example, if we measure g (2) (r1 , r2 , t)\n\n\f2\nafter an expansion time t, can we reconstruct the initial\ng (2) (r1 , r2 , 0) before the release from the trap?\nIdeally we would like to have a scaling relation like\nthat of Eq.(2) for g (2) . Then we would have simply that\ng (2) (r1 , r2 , t) \u221d g (2) (r1i /\u03bbi , r2i /\u03bbi , 0). Could such a scaling relation exist? Unfortunately the answer is no in\ngeneral, as shown in [10]: in an atomic gas, the existence of interactions imposes certain boundary conditions\non the many-body wave function and, as we shall now\nshow, these conditions are incompatible with scaling for\nall correlation functions except the density. At distances\nshorter than the interatomic separation, the wave function is determined up to a proportionality constant by\nthe Bethe-Peierls boundary condition through which the\ninteractions appear: for any value of the scattering length\na the many-body wave function \u03a8 obeys the condition for\nall pairs of atoms ij:\n\u03a8(|ri \u2212 rj | \u2192 0) \u221d\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\na |ri \u2212 rj |\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the limit is taken keeping all other atoms and the\ncenter of mass ri + rj fixed. Having taken care of the interactions via the boundary conditions, the only other\ncondition on \u03a8 is that it must obey the free-particle\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation [11]. These boundary conditions\napply also to all diagonal correlation functions: for example g (2) (r1 , r2 ) obeys the same condition as a function of |r1 \u2212 r2 |. The only exception is the density n(r)\nsince we need at least two coordinates to probe what happens as two atoms come close to each other whereas the\ndensity depends on a single coordinate. Eq.(5) has two\ncharacteristic features: I) it is isotropic (since it depends\non the modulus of ri \u2212 rj and not on its direction) and\nII) it introduces a length scale a. These two features will\npose problems for any scaling solution of the form Eq.(1):\nI) requires that all scaling functions \u03bbi (t) be identical,\nwhich is in general incompatible with the free expansion\nfrom an anisotropic trap. II) means that, even if the trap\nis isotropic (leading to identical \u03bbi (t)), a rescaling of the\ncoordinates would change the ratio a/|ri \u2212 rj | which is\nrequired to be fixed. These problems do not appear in\nthe ideal gas case where a = 0. If a \u2192 \u221e (e.g. the case\nof the unitary Fermi gas), II) is of no consequence but I)\nstill requires that the trap be spherical.\nNevertheless we can show that there exists in principle an experimental procedure that can restore scaling during expansion to the many-body wave function of a gas initially in equilibrium, trapped in an\nanisotropic trap and interacting via an arbitrary scattering length a. By this we mean that |\u03a8(r1 , ..., rN , t)|2 \u221d\n|\u03a8(r1 /\u03bb(t), ..., rN /\u03bb(t), 0)|2 .\nNote that information\nabout the initial off-diagonal properties is lost and so\nwe cannot for example access the momentum space correlation functions in the same way using this method.\nTo defeat problem I) we notice that it is not the initial\ntrap anisotropy (i.e. the difference between the \u03c9i ) which\ndestroys scaling but rather the expansion anisotropy (the\ndifference between the \u03bbi (t)). A judicious time depen-\n\ndent modulation of the trapping constants \u03c9i (t) during\nthe release process is sufficient to restore isotropy (all directions scaling with the same \u03bb(t)) as we shall see below.\nProblem II) can also be dealt with if the scattering length\ncan be changed during the expansion by modifying the\napplied magnetic field - which requires the existence of\nan accessible Feshbach resonance. The idea is to change\nthe scattering length a as a function of time during the\nexpansion so as to preserve Eq.(5).\nWe now briefly discuss the calculations which underlie\nthe scaling approach. Indeed, they follow almost exactly\nthose in [12]. The main differences with respect to that\nReference are: here we consider a general anisotropic\ntrap (as opposed to a spherical one), a different timedependence of the trapping frequencies \u03c9i (t) and an arbitrary initial scattering length, instead of the unitary\nlimit. Therefore we shall give here only an outline referring the reader for any further details to the more complete discussion in that Reference.\nFor concreteness let us specialize to the experimentally\nrelevant case of an initially cigar-shaped potential (even\nthough this assumption is not necessary for our procedure since we could envision other possibilities such as a\npancake geometry):\nU=\n\n\u0001 1\n1\n2\nm\u03c9\u22a5\n(t) x2 + y 2 + m\u03c9z2 (t)z 2\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere for t < 0 we have \u03c9x = \u03c9y = \u03c9\u22a5 and \u03c9z < \u03c9\u22a5 .\nWe also assume that, prior to expansion, the gas is in a\n(many-body) eigenstate \u03a8(r1 , ..., rN , t = 0) in the trap\nU (t = 0), obeying the boundary conditions Eq.(5) for a\ngiven scattering length a. We make an ansatz for the\ntime-dependence of the wave function:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nN\nX\nmrj2 \u03bb\u0307/2~\u03bb\uf8f8\n\u03a8(r1 , ..., rN , t) = N (t) exp \uf8edi\nj=1\n\n\u00d7\u03a8(r1 /\u03bb, ..., rN /\u03bb, t = 0)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere there is a time-dependent normalisation N and a\nsingle scaling factor \u03bb(t) which is the same for all directions. For a general value of \u03bb(t) this wave function\nno longer respects the boundary conditions for the initial value of the scattering length and so we must change\nthem using a Feshbach resonance according to the expression\na(t) = a(0)\u03bb(t)\n\n(8)\n\nSince \u03bb(t) generally increases with time, the scattering\nlength must also increase (in modulus) but the dilution parameter n|a|3 (where n is the density of the gas)\nwill remain constant. This procedure solves problem II).\nNow we insert this wave function into the free-particle\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, use the fact that \u03a8(t = 0) is an\neigenstate of the harmonic potential and, by equating\nseparately terms in z 2 \u03a8(t = 0) and in x2 \u03a8(t = 0), we\nfind that it is indeed a solution provided that we can\n\n\f3\nsatisfy the two equations\n2\n\u03c9\u22a5\n(0)\n2\n\u2212 \u03c9\u22a5\n(t)\u03bb\n\u03bb3\n\u03c9 2 (0)\n\u03bb\u0308 = z 3 \u2212 \u03c9z2 (t)\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\u0308 =\n\n(9)\n\nIf a physically acceptable solution \u03bb(t) of these equations can be found then also difficulty I) will have been\novercome. Indeed such a solution does exist if the trapping constants \u03c9z,\u22a5 (t) can be changed independently in\nan appropriate manner. For example, one such solution is to simply switch off the trapping potential along\nz instantaneously\nas usual (\u03c9z (t > 0) = 0) implying\np\n\u03bb(t) =\n1 + \u03c9z (0)2 t2 (with \u03bb(0) = 1 and \u03bb\u0307(0) = 0)\nwhich in turn requires that\n\uf8f1\nt<0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c9\u22a5 (0)\n(10)\n\u03c9\u22a5 (t) =\n\u221a 2\n\uf8f4\n(0)\u2212\u03c9z2 (0)\n\uf8f3 \u03c9\u22a5\nt\n>\n0\n1+\u03c9 2 (0)t2\nz\n\ni.e., an initial discontinuous change of \u03c9\u22a5 followed by a\ngradual decrease to zero going as 1/t2 at large times. It is\nclear that, for highly anisotropic traps, the discontinuity\ncan be neglected (see Fig. 1).\nSo, to summarize, the experimental procedure consists of simultaneously changing during the expansion\nthe radial trapping potential according to Eq.(10) and\nthe p\nscattering length according to Eq.(8), i.e. a(t) =\na(0) 1 + \u03c9z (0)2 t2 .\nWe see therefore that the restriction due to the boundary condition is not on the initial anisotropy of the trap\nbut on the anisotropy of the expansion. Here it proceeds isotropically for all times and |\u03a8(t)|2 expands in a\nself-similar way so that the expansion acts as a perfect\nmicroscope, enlarging without distortion all the features\nof the cloud. We propose therefore that this method,\nwhen applicable, be considered the \"best practice\" for\nmeasuring real-space correlation functions.\nTo illustrate a practical implementation, we consider\nthe example of a Fermi gas of atoms, in a mixture of\ntwo different spin states. We consider an optical trap,\nin which the atoms are trapped in the radial dimensions\nby a collimated laser beam, and trapped in the axial dimension by another laser beam with a much larger waist.\nThis combined optical potential would make independent\nadjustment of the trapping frequencies relatively simple.\nIn addition, a pair of magnetic coils in Helmholtz configuration would provide the bias field needed to sweep\nthe scattering length during the expansion without contributing to the trapping potential.\nBy abruptly switching off the axial trapping potential, the cloud would begin to expand freely along the\naxial dimension. The radial confinement would then be\nreduced by modulating the optical trap with a pair of\ncrossed acousto-optic modulators, which can be used to\nproduce a shallower, time-averaged potential which provides the desired trapping frequency. With this technique, we would expand the cloud until its optical depth\n\nis low enough, and its radial dimensions large enough,\nthat atom noise correlations become measureable. At\nthis point, the atoms would be imaged in situ using absorption imaging. By appropriately choosing the optical\ntransition and polarization for the imaging beam, atoms\nin the different spin states could also be distinguished\nand imaged independently in rapid succession. In this\nway, spatial correlations between atoms in the different\nspin states would be detected.\nWe now make a few final remarks. The possible candidate systems for this method would include the dilute\nsingle species Bose gas and the two spin or mass species\nFermi gas at any value of the scattering length. In this\nlatter case it is not necessary that the the numbers of\natoms in each spin state be equal and so it could be also\napplied to the polarized Fermi gas. On the other hand it\nwould be perhaps difficult to apply it to mixtures where\nmore than one scattering length is present since we might\nlose the ability to control each of them simultaneously.\nWe relie of course on the existence of an accessible\nFeshbach resonance and the application of a controlling\nmagnetic field. Therefore, if the trapping potential is\nmagnetic in origin then the two effects (trapping and detuning from resonance) must be handled together. Finally we must keep in mind that the true potential seen\nby the gas includes the effect of gravity. When the gas\nbegins to expand it will also begin to fall. This could\nintroduce a distortion in the potential seen by the gas\nsince it would move from its original position in the trap.\nTo avoid this problem one possible solution would be to\nintroduce a compensating magnetic field gradient.\nIn conclusion, we began by discussing the importance\nand difficulty of measurements of correlation functions\nat short distances which can usually only be made after expansion. We then show that, apart from the cases\nof the ideal and isotropic unitary gases, the second and\nhigher order diagonal correlation functions do not exhibit scaling behaviour during the expansion of the gas\n\n\u03a9\u00a6 HtL\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n\u0080\n\u03a9\u00a6 H0L\n1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03a9z t\n\nFIG. 1: Radial trapping frequency \u03c9\u22a5 (t) from Eq.(10) for\n\u03c9z (0)/\u03c9\u22a5 (0) = 0.5 (continuous line) and \u03c9z (0)/\u03c9\u22a5 (0) = 0.1\n(dashed line). Note that the t = 0 discontinuity is appreciable\nin the first case (13%) but negligible in the second (0.5%).\n\n\f4\nand so scaling cannot be used to relate the measured values after expansion to those existing in the trap. We\ndirectly trace this violation of scaling to the existence of\nthe Bethe-Peierls boundary conditions imposed on the\nmany-body wave function due to the s-wave scattering\nbetween atoms. To address this problem we propose an\nexperimental procedure that fully restores scaling to the\ndiagonal correlation functions for systems originally in\nanisotropic traps and interacting via an arbitrary value\nof the scattering length which relies on a well-known\n\nansatz for the many-body wave function. This ansatz\nis valid provided that the trapping potentials along different directions can be changed independently and that\nthe scattering length characterizing the interaction can\nbe changed as a function of time with the use of a Feshbach resonance.\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with D.
