They developed quantum\nerror-correcting codes that protect a finite-dimensional\nsubspace of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and\nshowed that these codes can be used to transmit highfidelity quantum information at a nonzero asymptotic\nrate. In this paper, we continue the study of the Gaussian quantum channel begun in [14]. Our main result is\nthat the coherent information computed by Holevo and\nWerner is in fact an achievable rate. This result lends\nnontrivial support to the coherent information conjecture.\n\nWe study the properties of quantum stabilizer codes that\nembed a finite-dimensional protected code space in an infinitedimensional Hilbert space.

From the existence of symplectically integral lattices with suitable properties, we infer a\nlower bound on the quantum capacity of the Gaussian quantum channel that matches the one-shot coherent information\noptimized over Gaussian input states.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nWe define the Gaussian quantum channel and review\nthe results of Holevo and Werner [13] in Sec. II. In Sec.\nIII, we describe the stabilizer codes for continuous quantum variables introduced in [14], which are based on\nthe concept of a symplectically integral lattice embedded in phase space. In Sec. IV and V, we apply these\ncodes to the Gaussian quantum channel, and calculate an\nachievable rate arising from lattices that realize efficient\npackings of spheres in high dimensions. This achievable\nrate matches the one-shot coherent information IQ of the\nchannel in cases where 2IQ is an integer. Rates achieved\nwith concatenated coding are calculated in Sec. VI; these\nfall short of the coherent information but come close. In\nSec. VII, we consider the Gaussian classical channel, and\nagain find that concatenated codes achieve rates close to\nthe capacity. Sec. VIII contains some concluding comments about the quantum capacity of the Gaussian quantum channel.\n\nA central problem in quantum information theory is\nto determine the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum\nchannel - the maximum rate at which coherent quantum\ninformation can be transmitted through the channel and\nrecovered with arbitrarily good fidelity [1,2]. A general\nsolution to the corresponding problem for classical noisy\nchannels was found by Shannon in the pioneering paper\nthat launched classical information theory [3,4]. With\nthe development of the theory of quantum error correction [5,6], considerable progress has been made toward\ncharacterizing the quantum channel capacity [7], but it\nremains less well understood than the classical capacity.\nThe asymptotic coherent information has been shown\nto provide an upper bound on the capacity [8,9] and\na matching lower bound has been conjectured, but not\nproven [10]. Unfortunately, the coherent information is\nnot subadditive [11], so that its asymptotic value is not\neasily computed. Therefore, it has been possible to verify\nthe coherent information conjecture in just a few simple\ncases [12].\n\nII. THE GAUSSIAN QUANTUM CHANNEL\n\nOne quantum channel of considerable intrinsic interest is the Gaussian quantum channel, which might also\nbe simple enough to be analytically tractable, thus providing a fertile testing ground for the general theory of\nquantum capacities. A simple analytic formula for the\ncapacity of the Gaussian classical channel was found by\nShannon [3,4]. The Gaussian quantum channel was studied by Holevo and Werner [13], who computed the oneshot coherent information for Gaussian input states, and\nderived an upper bound on the quantum capacity.\n\nThe Gaussian quantum channel is a natural generalization of the Gaussian classical channel. In the classical\ncase, we consider a channel such that the input x and\nthe output y are real numbers. The channel applies a\ndisplacement to the input by distance \u03be,\ny =x+\u03be ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03be is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero\nand variance \u03c3 2 ; the probability distribution governing \u03be\nis\n2\n2\n1\ne\u2212\u03be /2\u03c3 .\n(2)\nP (\u03be) = \u221a\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\n\u2217\n\nCALT-68-2323\njimh@theory.caltech.edu\n\u2021\npreskill@theory.caltech.edu\n\u2020\n\nSimilarly, acting on a quantum system described by\n1\n\n\fcanonical variables q and p that satisfy the commutation\nrelation [q, p] = i~, we may consider a quantum channel\nthat applies a phase-space displacement described by the\nunitary operator\n\u0001\nD(\u03b1) = exp \u03b1a\u2020 + \u03b1\u2217 a ,\n(3)\n\ncompared to \u03c3. To obtain an interesting notion of capacity, we impose a constraint on the average power of the\nsignal,\n1 X \u0010 (a) \u00112\n\u2264P ,\nxi\nn i\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a complex number, [a, a\u2020 ] = 1, and q, p can\nbe expressed in terms of a and a\u2020 as\nr\nr\n\u0001\n\u0001\n~\n~\n\u2020\n(4)\na + a , p = \u2212i\na \u2212 a\u2020 .\nq=\n2\n2\n\nfor each a. We say that a rate R (in bits) is achievable\nwith power constraint P if the there is a sequence of\ncodes satisfying the constraint such that the \u03b2th code in\nthe sequence contains m\u03b2 signals with length n\u03b2 , where\nR = lim\n\nThis quantum channel is Gaussian if \u03b1 is a complex Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance \u03c3\u0303 2 .\nIn that case, the channel is the superoperator (tracepreserving completely positive map) E that acts on the\ndensity operator \u03c1 according to\nZ\n2\n2\n1\n\u03c1 \u2192 E(\u03c1) =\nd2 \u03b1 e\u2212|\u03b1| /\u03c3\u0303 D(\u03b1)\u03c1D(\u03b1)\u2020 . (5)\n2\n\u03c0\u03c3\u0303\n\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\np \u2192 p + \u03bep ,\n\n(6)\n\nIn contrast, no power constraint is needed to define\nthe quantum capacity of the quantum channel. Rather,\nPlanck's constant ~ enables us to define a dimensionless\nvariance \u03c3\u0303 2 = \u03c3 2 /~, and the capacity is a function of\nthis quantity. In the quantum case, a code consists of\nan encoding superoperator that maps an m-dimensional\nHilbert space Hm into the infinite-dimensional Hilbert\nspace H\u2297N of N canonical quantum systems, and a decoding superoperator that maps H\u2297N back to Hm . We\nsay that the rate R (in qubits) is achievable if there is a\nsequence of codes such that\n\nTo define the capacity, we consider a channel's nth\nextension. In the classical case, a message is transmitted\nconsisting of the n real variables\n(7)\n\nand the channel applies the displacement\n~x \u2192 ~x + \u03be~ ,\n\n\u03be~ = (\u03be1 , \u03be2 , . . . , \u03ben ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nR = lim\n\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere the \u03bei 's are independent Gaussian random variables, each with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2 . A code\nconsists of a finite number m of n-component input signals\n~x(a) ,\n\na = 1, 2, . . . , m\n\n(11)\n\nThe need for a constraint on the signal power to define the capacity of the Gaussian classical channel can\nbe understood on dimensional grounds. The classical capacity (in bits) is a dimensionless function of the variance\n\u03c3 2 , but \u03c3 2 has dimensions. Another quantity with the\ndimensions of \u03c3 2 is needed to construct a dimensionless\nvariable, and the power P fills this role.\n\nwhere \u03beq and \u03bep are real Gaussian random variables with\nmean zero and variance \u03c3 2 = ~\u03c3\u0303 2 .\n\n~x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ,\n\n1\nlog2 m\u03b2 ,\nn\u03b2\n\nand the probability of a decoding error vanishes in the\nlimit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. The capacity of the channel with power\nconstraint P is the supremum of all achievable rates.\n\nIn other words, the position q and momentum p are displaced independently,\nq \u2192 q + \u03beq ,\n\n(10)\n\n1\nlog2 m\u03b2 ,\nN\u03b2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere arbitrary states in Hm can be recovered with a\nfidelity that approaches 1 as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. The quantum\ncapacity CQ of the channel is defined as the supremum\nof all achievable rates.\n\n(9)\n\nHolevo and Werner [13] studied a more general Gaussian channel that includes damping or amplification as\nwell as displacement. However, we will confine our attention in this paper to channels that apply only displacements. Holevo and Werner derived a general upper\nbound on the quantum capacity by exploiting the properties of the \"diamond norm\" (norm of complete boundedness) of a superoperator. The diamond norm is defined\nas follows: First we define the trace norm of an operator\nX as\n\u221a\n(13)\nkXktr \u2261 tr X \u2020 X ,\n\nand a decoding function that maps output vectors to the\nindex set {1, 2, . . . , m}. We refer to n as the length of the\ncode.\nIf the input vectors were unrestricted, then for fixed\n\u03c3 2 we could easily construct a code with an arbitrarily\nlarge number of signals m and a decoding function that\ncorrectly identifies the index (a) of the input with arbitrarily small probability of error; even for n = 1 we\nmerely choose the distance between signals to be large\n\n2\n\n\fwhich for a self-adjoint operator is just the sum of the\nabsolute values of the eigenvalues. Then a norm of a\nsuperoperator E can be defined as\nkEkso = sup\n\nX6=0\n\nkE(X)ktr\n.\nkXktr\n\ngeneral, and therefore the quantum capacity need not\ncoincide with the \"one-shot\" capacity C1 . Holevo and\nWerner showed that for the Gaussian quantum channel,\nthe supremum of IQ over Gaussian input states is\n\n(14)\n\n(IQ )max = log2 (~/e\u03c3 2 )\n\n(where e = 2.71828..) for ~/e\u03c3 2 > 1, and (IQ )max = 0\nfor ~/e\u03c3 2 \u2264 1. According to the coherent-information\nconjecture, eq. (23) should be an achievable rate.\n\nThe superoperator norm is not stable with respect to\nappending an ancillary system on which E acts trivially.\nThus we define the diamond norm of E as\nkEk\u22c4 = sup kE \u2297 In kso ,\n\n(23)\n\n(15)\n\nn\n\nIII. QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTING CODES\nFOR CONTINUOUS QUANTUM VARIABLES\n\nwhere In denotes the n-dimensional identity operator.\n(This supremum is always attained for some n no larger\nthan the dimension of the Hilbert space on which E acts.)\nHolevo and Werner showed that the quantum capacity\nobeys the upper bound\nCQ (E) \u2264 log2 kE \u25e6 T k\u22c4 ,\n\nThe lattice codes developed in [14] are stabilizer codes\n[15,16] that embed a finite-dimensional code space in\nthe infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of N \"oscillators,\" a system described by 2N canonical variables\nq1 , q2 , . . . qN , p1 , p2 , . . . , pN . That is, the code space is the\nsimultaneous eigenstate of 2N commuting unitary operators, the generators of the code's stabilizer group.

To diagnose and correct this error, the eigenvalues of all stabilizer generators are measured, which\ndetermines the value of (\u03be~q , \u03be~p ) modulo the normalizer\nlattice L\u22a5 . To recover, a displacement of minimal length\nis applied that returns the stabilizer eigenvalues to their\nstandard values, and so restores the quantum state to the\ncode space. We can associate with the origin of the normalizer lattice its Voronoi cell, the set of points in R2N\nthat are closer to the origin than to any other lattice site.\nRecovery is successful if the applied displacement lies in\nthis Voronoi cell. Thus, we can estimate the likelihood of\na decoding error by calculating the probability that the\ndisplacement lies outside the Voronoi cell.\n\nVn =\n\n(50)\n\n(49)\nV.

(55) falls two qubits\nshort of the coherent information eq. (23). We will now\n5\n\n\fshow that this gap can be closed by using tighter estimates of the error probability. We established eq. (55)\nby filling phase space with nonoverlapping spheres, which\nis overly conservative. It is acceptable for the spheres to\noverlap, as long as the overlaps occupy an asymptotically negligible fraction of the total volume, as suggested\nin Fig. 1.\n\nWe can use this result to bound the probability of a decoding error, and establish that a specified rate is achievable. Our argument will closely follow de Buda [20],\nwho performed a similar analysis of lattice codes for the\nGaussian classical channel. However, the quantum case\nis considerably easier to analyze, because we can avoid\ncomplications arising from the power constraint [21\u201323].\n\nOur improved estimate applies another result obtained\nby Buser and Sarnak [17]. They note that the moduli\nspace of symplectically self-dual lattices is compact and\nequipped with a natural invariant measure. Therefore, it\nmakes sense to consider averaging over all lattices. Denote by h*i the average over all symplectically self-dual\nlattices with specified dimension n = 2N , and let f (x) denote an integrable rotationally-invariant function of the\nvector x (that is a function of the length |x| of x). Then\nBuser and Sarnak [17] show that\nE Z\nD X\nf (x) = f (x) dn x .\n(56)\n\nA decoding error occurs if the channel displaces the\norigin to a point outside the Voronoi cell centered at the\norigin. The Voronoi cell has a complicated geometry, so\nthat the error probability is not easy to analyze. But\nwe can simplify the analysis with a trick [20]. Imagine\ndrawing a sphere with radius\np\na = n(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5)\n(58)\n\naround each lattice site, where \u03b5 > 0; this value of a is\nchosen so that the typical displacement introduced by the\nchannel has length less than a; the probability of a shift\nlarger than a thus becomes negligible for large n. It may\nbe that these spheres overlap. However, a vector that is\ncontained in the sphere centered at the origin, and is not\ncontained in the sphere centered at any other lattice site,\nmust be closer to the origin than any other lattice site.\nTherefore, the vector is contained in the origin's Voronoi\ncell, and is a shift that can be corrected successfully. (See\nFig. 1.)\n\nx\u2208L\\{0}\n\n(Note that the sum is over all nonzero vectors in the\nlattice L.) It follows that there must exist a particular\nsymplectically self-dual lattice L such that\nZ\nX\nf (x) \u2264 f (x) dn x .\n(57)\nx\u2208L\\{0}\n\nHence (ignoring the possibility of an atypical shift by\n\u03be > a) we can upper bound the probability of error by\nestimating the probability that the shift moves any other\nlattice site into the sphere of radius a around the origin.\nWe then find\nX Z\nPerror \u2264\nP (x \u2212 r)dn r ,\n(59)\n\nThe statement that a unimodular lattice exists that satisfies eq. (57) is the well-known Minkowski-Hlawka theorem [19].

Two ways to estimate the rate achieved by a lattice\ncode. Each site of the normalizer lattice has a Voronoi cell\n(represented here by a square) containing all points that are\ncloser to that site than any other site. Displacements that\nmove a site to a position within its Voronoi cell can be corrected. The volume of the Voronoi cell determines the rate\nof the code. In (a), the ball containing typical displacements\nlies within the cell, so that the error probability is small. In\n(b), the ball of typical displacements is not completely contained within the cell, but the region where neighboring balls\noverlap (shown in black) has a small volume, so that the error\nprobability is still small.\n\nby interchanging the order of integration, we find that\nPerror \u2264\n\n1\n* Vn * an ,\n\u2206\n\n(61)\n\nthe ratio of the volume of the n-dimensional sphere of\nradius a to the volume of the unit cell.\nNow the volume \u2206 of the unit cell of the normalizer\nlattice L\u22a5 , and the dimension m of the code space, are\nrelated by\n6\n\n\f\u2206 = (2\u03c0~)N m\u22121 = 2\u03c0~ * 2\u2212R\n\n\u0001N\n\n,\n\nif a sufficiently small fraction of the N qudits are damaged. Let us compare the rates achieved by concatenated\ncodes to the rates achieved with codes derived from efficient sphere packings.\n\n(62)\n\nwhere R is the rate, and we may estimate the volume of\nthe sphere as\nn\n\nVn * a \u2264\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0e\nn\n\n\u0013n/2\n\n\u0001n/2\nn(\u03c3 + \u03b5)\n,\n2\n\nwhere n = 2N . Thus we conclude that\n\u0012\n\u0013N\ne(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5) R\nPerror \u2264\n*2\n.\n~\n\nWe analyze the effectiveness of concatenated codes in\ntwo stages. First we consider how likely each of the N\nqudits is to sustain damage if the underlying oscillator is\nsubjected to the Gaussian quantum channel. The area\nof the unit cell of the two-dimensional square normalizer\nlattice that represents the encoded operations acting on\nthe qudit is 2\u03c0~/d,pand the minimum distance between\nlattice sites is \u03b4 = 2\u03c0~/d. A displacement of q by a * \u03b4,\nwhere a is an integer, is the operation X a acting on the\ncode space, and a displacement of p by b*\u03b4 is the operation\nZ b , where X and Z are the Pauli operators acting on the\nqudit; these act on a basis {|ji, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , d \u2212 1} for\nthe qudit according to\n\n(63)\n\n(64)\n\nTherefore, the error probability becomes small for large\nN for any rate R such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\nR < log2\n,\n(65)\ne(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5)\n\nX : |ji \u2192 |j + 1 (mod d)i ,\nZ : |ji \u2192 wj |ji ,\n\nwhere \u03b5 may be arbitrarily small.

This rate matches the optimal value eq. (23) of the\none-shot coherent information for Gaussian inputs. We\nnote, again, that the rates that we can obtain from rescaling a symplectically self-dual lattice are restricted to\nR = log2 \u03bb, where \u03bb is an integer. Thus for specified\n\u03c3 2 , the achievable rate that we have established is really\nthe maximal value of\nR = log2 \u03bb ,\n\n\u03bb\u2208Z ,\n\nIf the shifts in q and p are Gaussian random variables\nwith variance \u03c3 2 , then the probability that a shift causes\nan uncorrectable errorpis no larger than the probability\nthat the shift exceeds \u03c0~/2d, or\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\n1\npX , pZ \u2264\n2* \u221a\ndxe\u2212x /2\u03c3\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2\n\u03c0~/2d\np\n(71)\n= erfc( \u03c0~/4d\u03c3 2 ) ,\n\n(67)\n\nsuch that the positive integer \u03bb satisfies\n~\n.\ne\u03c3 2\n\n(69)\n\n(68)\n\nwhere erfc denotes the complementary error function.\nHere pX is the probability of an \"X error\" acting on\nthe qudit, of the form X a for a 6\u2261 0 (mod d), and pZ\ndenotes the probability of a \"Z error\" of the form Z b for\nb 6\u2261 0 (mod d). The X and Z errors are uncorrelated, and\nerrors with a, b = \u00b11 are much more likely than errors\nwith |a|, |b| > 1. By choosing d \u223c ~/\u03c3 2 , we can achieve\na small error probability for each oscillator.\n\nAnother method for establishing achievable rates over\nthe Gaussian quantum channel was described in [14],\nbased on concatenated coding. In each of N \"oscillators\" described by canonical variables pi and qi , a ddimensional system (\"qudit\") is encoded that is protected against sufficiently small shifts in pi and qi . The\nencoded qudit is associated with a square lattice in 2dimensional phase space. Then a stabilizer code is constructed that embeds a k-qudit code space in the Hilbert\nspace of N qudits; these k encoded qudits are protected\n\nThe second stage of the argument is to determine the\nrate that can be achieved by a qudit code if pX , pZ satisfy\neq. (71). We will consider codes of the Calderbank-ShorSteane (CSS) type, for which the correction of X errors\nand Z errors can be considered separately [24,25]. A\nCSS code is a stabilizer code, in which each stabilizer\ngenerator is either a tensor product of I's and powers of\nZ (measuring these generators diagnoses the X errors) or\na tensor product of I's and powers of X (for diagnosing\nthe Z errors).\n\n\u03bb<\n\nVI. ACHIEVABLE RATES FROM\nCONCATENATED CODES\n\n7\n\n\fWe can establish an achievable rate by averaging the\nerror probability over CSS codes; we give only an informal sketch of the argument. Suppose that we fix the\nblock size N and the number of encoded qudits k. Now\nselect the generators of the code's stabilizer group at random. About half of the N \u2212 k generators are of the Z\ntype and about half are of the X type. Thus the number\nof possible values for the eigenvalues of the generators of\neach type is about\n1\n\nd 2 (N \u2212k) .\n\nRd < 1 \u2212 2Hd (pZ ) \u2212 2pZ logd (d \u2212 1) .\n\n(77)\n\nConverted to qubits, the rate becomes\nR = log2 d * Rd\n\n(78)\n\nUnder these conditions, the probability of error averaged\nover CSS codes becomes arbitrarily small for N large. It\nfollows that there is a particular sequence of CSS codes\nwith rate approaching eq. (76-78), and error probability\ngoing to zero in the limit N \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(72)\n\nFor given \u03c3 2 , the optimal rate that can be attained by\nconcatenating a code that encodes a qudit in a single oscillator with a random CSS code, is found by estimating\npX and pZ using eq. (71) and then choosing d to maximize the rate R given by eq. (76-78). The results are\nshown in Fig. 2. This rate (in qubits) can be expressed\nas\n\u0001\n(79)\nR = log2 C 2 ~/\u03c3 2 ,\n\nNow we can analyze the probability that an uncorrectable\nX error afflicts the encoded quantum state (the probability of an uncorrectable Z error is analyzed in exactly\nthe same way). Suppose that X errors act independently\non the N qudits in the block, with a probability of error\nper qudit of pX . Thus for large N , the typical number of\ndamaged qudits is close to pX * N . A damaged qudit can\nbe damaged in any of d \u2212 1 different ways (X a , where\na = 1, 2, . . . , (d \u2212 1)). We will suppose, pessimistically,\nthat all d \u2212 1 shifts of the qudit are equally likely. The\nactual situation that arises in our concatenated coding\nscheme is more favorable \u2013 small values of |a| are more\nlikely \u2013 but our argument will not exploit this feature.\n\nwhere C 2 is a slowly varying function of \u03c3 2 /~ plotted in\nFig. 3. It turns out that this rate is actually fairly close\nto log2 d; that is, the optimal dimension d of the qudit encoded in each oscillator is approximately C 2 ~/\u03c3 2 .\nWith this choice for d, the error rate for each oscillator is\nreasonably small, and the random CSS code reduces the\nerror probability for the encoded state to a value exponentially small in N at a modest cost in rate. The rate\nachieved by concatenating coding lies strictly below the\ncoherent information IQ , but comes within one qubit of\nIQ for \u03c3 2 > 1.88 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\nThus, with high probability, the error that afflicts the\nblock will belong to a typical set of errors that contains\na number of elements close to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\nNtyp \u223c\n(d \u2212 1)N pX \u223c dN (Hd (pX )+pX logd (d\u22121)) ,\nN pX\n(73)\nwhere\n\nRate\nHd (p) = \u2212p logd p \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) logd (1 \u2212 p) .\n\n(74)\n\n7\n\nIf a particular typical error occurs, then recovery will succeed as long as there is no other typical error that generates the same error syndrome. It will be highly unlikely\nthat another typical error has the same syndrome as the\nactual error, provided that the number of possible error\n1\nsyndromes d 2 (N \u2212k) is large compared to the number of\ntypical errors. Therefore, the X errors can be corrected\nwith high probability for\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\n1\n1\u2212\n2\nN\n1\n* logd Ntyp \u223c Hd (pX ) + pX logd (d \u2212 1) , (75)\n>\nN\n\n6\n5\n\nCoherent\nInformation\n\n4\n3\n2\n\nConcatenated\nCodes\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c3\n\n(76)\n\nFIG. 2. Rates achieved by concatenated codes, compared\nto the one-shot coherent information optimized over Gaussian input states. Here \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the\nmagnitude of the phase-space displacement introduced by the\nchannel, in units with ~ = 1.\n\nSimilarly, the Z errors can be corrected with high probability by a random CSS code if the rate satisfies\n\nBoth the concatenated codes and the codes derived from efficient sphere packings are stabilizer codes,\n\nor for a rate Rd in qudits satisfying\nRd \u2261\n\nk\n< 1 \u2212 2Hd (pX ) \u2212 2pX logd (d \u2212 1)\nN\n\n8\n\n\fparticular, that concatenated codes achieve rates that are\nclose to the classical channel capacity.\n\nand therefore both are associated with lattices in 2N dimensional phase space. But while the sphere-packing\ncodes have been chosen so that the shortest nonzero vector on the lattice is large relative to the size of the unit\ncell, the concatenated codes correspond to sphere packings of poor quality. For the concatenated codes, the\nshortest vector of the normalizer lattice has length l,\nwhere\nl2 = 2\u03c0~/d\n\nShannon's expression for the capacity of the classical\nGaussian channel can be understood heuristically as follows [3,4]. If the input signals have average power P ,\nwhich is inflated by the Gaussian noise to P + \u03c3 2 , then\nif n real variables are transmitted, the total volume occupied by the space\np of output signals is the volume of a\nsphere of radius n(P + \u03c3 2 ), or\n\n(80)\n\n\u0001n/2\n.\ntotal volume = Vn * n(P + \u03c3 2 )\n\nand the rate R is close to log2 d. The\n\u221a efficient sphere\npackings have radius r = l/2 close to n\u03c3 2 , or\n8N ~ \u2212R\nl =\n*2\n.\ne\n2\n\nWe will decode a received message as the signal state\nthat is the minimal distance away. Consider averaging\nover all codes that satisfy the power constraint and have\nm signals. When a message is received, the signal that\nwas\np sent will typically occupy a decoding sphere of radius\n(n(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5) centered at the received message, which has\nvolume\n\u0001n/2\ndecoding sphere volume = Vn * n(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5)\n. (83)\n\n(81)\n\nHence, if we compare sphere-packing codes and concatenated codes with comparable rates, the sphere-packing\ncodes havepminimum distance that is larger by a factor\nof about 4N/\u03c0e. The concatenated codes achieve a\nhigh rate not because the minimum distance of the lattice is large, but rather because the decoding procedure\nexploits the hierarchical structure of the code.\n\nA decoding error can arise if another one of the m signals,\naside from the one that was sent, is also contained in\nthe decoding sphere. The probability that p\na randomly\nselected signal inside the sphere of radius n(P + \u03c3 2 )\nis\np contained in a particular decoding sphere of radius\nn(\u03c3 2 + \u03b5) is the ratio of the volume of the spheres, so\nthe probability of a decoding error can be upper bounded\nby m times that ratio, or\n\nC2\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nPerror < m *\n0.1\n\n0\n\n.001\n\n.01\n\n.1\n\n(82)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c32 + \u03b5\n\u03c32 + P\n\n\u0013n/2\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\u0013n/2\n\u03c32 + \u03b5\n22R * 2\n, (84)\n\u03c3 +P\n\nwhere R is the rate of the code. If the probability of error averaged over codes and signals satisfies this bound,\nthere is a particular code that satisfies the bound when\nwe average only over signals. If Perror < \u03b4 when we average over signals, then we can discard at most half of\nall the signals (reducing the rate by at most 1/n bits) to\nobtain a new code with Perror < 2\u03b4 for all signals. Since\n\u03b5 can be chosen arbitrarily small for sufficiently large n,\nwe conclude that there exist codes with arbitrarily small\nprobability of error and rate R arbitrarily close to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nP\nC = log2 1 + 2 ,\n(85)\n2\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\nFIG. 3.

Units have been chosen such that ~ = 1.\nThe horizontal lines are at C 2 = 1/e, corresponding to a rate\nequal to the coherent information, and at C 2 = 1/2e, corresponding to one qubit below the coherent information.\n\nVII. THE CLASSICAL GAUSSIAN CHANNEL\n\nwhich is the Shannon capacity. Conversely, for any rate\nexceeding C, the decoding spheres inevitably have nonnegligible overlaps, and the error rate cannot be arbitrarily small.\n\nWe have found that quantum stabilizer codes based on\nefficient sphere packings can achieve rates for the Gaussian quantum channel that match the one-shot coherent\ninformation, and that concatenated codes achieve rates\nthat are below, but close to, the coherent information.\nNow, as an aside, we will discuss the corresponding statements for the classical Gaussian channel. We will see, in\n\nSuppose that, instead of Shannon's random coding, we\nuse a lattice code based on an efficient packing of spheres.\nIn this case, the power constraint can be imposed by including as signals all lattice sites that are contained in an\n9\n\n\f\u221a\nn-dimensional\n\u221a ball of radius nP , and the typical shifts\nby distance n\u03c3 2 \u221amust be correctable. Thus decoding\n2\nspheres of radius\np n\u03c3 are to be packed into a sphere\nof total radius n(P + \u03c3 2 ). Suppose that the lattice is\nchosen so that nonoverlapping spheres centered at the\nlattice sites fill a fraction at least 2\u2212(n\u22121) of the total\nvolume; the existence of such a lattice is established by\nMinkowski's estimate [18]. Then the number m of signals\nsatisfies\n\u0001n/2\nm * Vn * (n\u03c3 2 )n/2 \u2265 2\u2212(n\u22121) * Vn * n(P + \u03c3 2 )\n, (86)\n\nFor the Gaussian channel with mean zero and variance\n\u03c3 2 , the probability p of an error in each real variable\ntransmitted is no larger than the probability of a shift by\na distance exceeding \u2206x, or\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n3P/2d2 \u03c3 2 ,\n(92)\np \u2264 erfc\n\nwhere erfc denotes the complementary error function.\n\nWe reduce the error probability further by encoding\nk < n dits in the block of n dits. Arguing as in Sec. VI,\nwe see that a random code for dits achieves an asymptotic\nrate in bits given by\n\nor\n\n\u0013n/2\n\u0012\nP\n,\nm \u2265 2\u2212n 1 + 2\n\u03c3\n\nR = log2 d * (1 \u2212 Hd (p) \u2212 p logd (d \u2212 1)) .\n\n(87)\n\nGiven \u03c3 2 , using the expression eq. (92) for p, and choosing d to optimize the rate in eq. (93), we obtain a rate\nclose to the Shannon capacity, as shown in Fig. 4. As\nfor the concatenated quantum code, the rate of the concatenated\np classical code is close to log2 d, where d \u223c\nC(\u03c3 2 ) * P/\u03c3 2 , and C(\u03c3 2 ) is a slowly varying function.\n\ncorresponding to the rate\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nP\nR \u2261 * log2 m = log2 1 + 2 \u2212 1 ,\nn\n2\n\u03c3\n\n(88)\n\nwhich is one bit less than the Shannon capacity.\n\nRate\n\nMuch as in the discussion of quantum lattice codes\nin Sec. V, an improved estimate of the achievable rate\nis obtained if we allow the decoding spheres to overlap\n[20\u201323]. In fact, there are classical lattice codes with rate\narbitrarily close to the capacity, such that the probability\nof error, averaged over signals, is arbitrarily small [23].\nUnfortunately, though, because of the power constraint,\nthe error probability depends on which signal is sent, and\nthe trick of deleting the worst half of the signals would\ndestroy the structure of the lattice. Alternatively, it can\nbe shown that for any rate\nR<\n\n1\nlog2 (P/\u03c3 2 ) ,\n2\n\n(93)\n\n7\n6\n5\nShannon\nCapacity\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n(89)\n\n1\n\nConcatenated\nCodes\n\n00\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c3\n\nFIG. 4. Rates for the Gaussian classical channel achievable\nwith concatenated codes, compared to the Shannon capacity.\nHere \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the displacement, in units\nwith the power P = 1.\n\nthere are lattice codes with maximal probability of error that is arbitrarily small [20]. This achievable rate\napproaches the capacity for large P/\u03c3 2 .\nNow consider the rates that can be achieved for the\nGaussian classical channel with concatenated coding. A\nd-state system (dit) is encoded in each of n real variables.\nIf each real variable takes one of d possible values, with\nspacing 2\u2206x between the signals, then a shift by \u2206x can\nbe corrected. By replacing the sum over d values by an\nintegral, which can be justified for large d, we find an\naverage power per signal\nZ d\u2206x\n1\n1\nP \u223c\n(90)\nx2 dx = (d\u2206x)2 ;\n2d\u2206x \u2212d\u2206x\n3\n\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have described quantum stabilizer codes, based\non symplectically integral lattices in phase space, that\nprotect quantum information carried by systems described by continuous quantum variables. With these\ncodes, we can establish lower bounds on the capacities of\ncontinuous-variable quantum channels.\nFor the Gaussian quantum channel, the best rate we\nknow how to achieve with stabilizer coding matches the\none-shot coherent information optimized over Gaussian\ninputs, at least when the value of the coherent information is log2 of an integer. That our achievable rate\n\nthus the largest correctable shift can be expressed in\nterms of the average power as\n\u221a\n(91)\n\u2206x = 3P /d .\n10\n\n\fmatches the coherent information only for isolated values of the noise variance \u03c3 2 seems to be an artifact of\nour method of analysis, rather than indicative of any intrinsic property of the channel. Hence it is tempting to\nspeculate that this optimal one-shot coherent information actually is the quantum capacity of the channel.\n\n[5] P. W.

We don't know much\nabout how to construct these codes, or about their properties.\nIn the case of the depolarizing channel acting on qubits,\nShor and Smolin discovered that rates exceeding the\none-shot coherent information could be achieved. Their\nconstruction used concatenated codes, where the \"outer\ncode\" is a random stabilizer code, and the \"inner code\"\nis a degenerate code with a small block size [11]. The\nanalogous procedure for the Gaussian channel would be\nto concatenate an outer code based on a symplectically\nintegral lattice with an inner code that encodes one logical oscillator in a block of several oscillators. This inner\ncode, then, embeds an infinite-dimensional code space\nin a larger infinite-dimensional space, as do codes constructed by Braunstein [26] and Lloyd and Slotine [27].\nHowever, we have not been able to find concatenated\ncodes of this type that achieve rates exceeding the oneshot coherent information of the Gaussian channel.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Dave Beckman, Anne-Marie Berg\u00e9, Bob\nMcEliece, Michael Postol, Eric Rains, Peter Shor, and\nEdward Witten for helpful discussions and correspondence.
