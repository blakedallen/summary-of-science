In spite of the extensive research, many fundamental problems are still\nopen, and, in particular, it is not clear whether in one dimension (1D) Anderson localization can survive the effects of\nnonlinearities. This problem is relevant for experiments in nonlinear optics, for example disordered photonic lattices\n[6, 7], where Anderson localization was found in presence of nonlinear effects as well as experiments on Bose-Einstein\nCondensates (BEC) in disordered optical lattices [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The interplay between disorder and nonlinear\neffects leads to new interesting physics [9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In particular, the problem of spreading of wave packets\nand transmission are not simply related [17, 18], in contrast with the linear case.\nWe consider one-dimensional localization of stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE) in a\nrandom \u03b4-correlated potential V (x) with a Gaussian distribution (white noise), of zero mean and variance 2D, namely,\nhV (x)V (x\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ). The linear version of this model was studied extensively in the past [19]. Following our\nprevious analysis [20] we study Anderson localization of stationary solutions with energies \u03c9 in the framework of the\nstationary NLSE\n\u03c9\u03c6(x) = \u2212\u2202x2 \u03c6(x) + \u03b2\u03c63 (x) + V (x)\u03c6(x) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) is real, the variables are chosen in dimensionless units and the Planck constant is ~ = 1. For the lattice\nversion of the model, it was established rigorously [3, 21, 22] that the stationary solutions of this equation are\nexponentially localized for a wide range of conditions. It was also argued that the rate of growth of moments for the\nstationary NLSE (1) coincides exactly with the linear case [20] and determines the localization length.\nWe will specifically calculate h\u03c62 (x)i of solutions of Eq. (1) that are found for a certain \u03c9, with given boundary\nconditions at some point, for example \u03c6(x = 0) and \u03c6\u2032 (x = 0), where prime means the derivative with respect to x.\nThis will be done with the help of the analogy with the Langevin equation [19, 20, 23]. In particular, we will calculate\nthe growth rate of the second moment,\nlnh\u03c62 (x)i\n> 0,\nx\u2192\u221e\nx\n\n2\u03b3 = lim\n\n\u03be=\n\n1\n,\n\u03b3\n\n(2)\n\nthat will turn out to be independent of \u03b2, where \u03be is the localization length. Note, it is different from the usually\n2\nd\nstudied (in the linear case) self averaging quantity \u03b3s = 12 dx\nhln \u03c62 (x)i = 12 limx\u2192\u221e hln \u03c6x (x)i , and \u03b3 is a smooth\nfunction of energy. Since the distribution of the random potentials is translationally invariant, it is independent of the\nchoice of the initial point as x = 0. Like in the linear case, starting from a specific initial condition, \u03c6(x) will typically\ngrow. For specific values of \u03c9 at some point this function will start to decay, so that a normalized eigenfunction is\nfound. This is the approach \u00e0 la Borland [24, 25] that was made rigorous for the linear case in [26, 27]. Here, following\n[20] we extend this approach, in a heuristic form, to the nonlinear case. The envelope of the wave function will grow\nexponentially if we start either from the right or from the left. The value of \u03c9 results from the matching condition, so\nthat an eigenfunction has some maximum and decays in both directions as required by the normalization condition.\nThe exponential decay is an asymptotic property, while the matching is determined by the potential in the vicinity of\n\n\f2\nthe maximum. This observation is crucial for the validity of this approach and enables us to determine the exponential\ndecay rate of states from the solution of the initial value problem (1). In [20] a linear equation for the moments of\n\u03c6(x) of Eq. (1) and its Langevin analog was derived and it was shown that the exponents that control the growth of\nthe moments are identical to the ones of the linear system (\u03b2 = 0). In the present paper it will be shown that this is\nalso correct for the asymptotic behavior of the moments.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The analogy with the Langevin equation and dynamics of the moments is\noutlined in Section II. The generalized Lyapunov exponents, that are the eigenvalues which determine the growth of\nthe various moments, are presented in Section II and their asymptotic behavior is derived analytically for the first\ntime in Appendix A (they were found numerically in [28]). The resulting asymptotic expansion for the growth of the\nmoments is presented in Section III. The results are summarized in Section IV.\nII.\n\nTHE FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATION AND LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS\n\nFollowing Ref. [20], we perform the calculation of h\u03c62 (x)i by using the analogy with the classical Langevin equation\n[19, 23]. Therefore, considering the x-coordinate as the formal time variable on the half axis x \u2261 \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u221e), Eq. (1)\nreduces to the Langevin equation\n\u03c6\u0308 + \u03c9\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c63 \u2212 V (\u03c4 )\u03c6 = 0\n\n(3)\n\nwith the \u03b4 correlated Gaussian noise V (\u03c4 ). Now we introduce new variables u = \u03c6 and v = \u03c6\u0307 \u2261 d\u03c6\nd\u03c4 (that play the role\nof position and velocity in the Langevin equation) and a distribution function of these new variables is P = P (u, v, \u03c4 ).\nThe dynamical process in the presence of the Gaussian \u03b4-correlated noise is described by the distribution function\nthat satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation: (FPE) [20, 30]\n\u2202\u03c4 P \u2212 [\u03c9u \u2212 \u03b2u3 ]\u2202v P + v\u2202u P \u2212 2Du2 \u2202v2 P = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere 2Du2 is the only nonzero component of the diffusion tensor.\nA.\n\nEquation for moments\n\nWe are interested in the average quantum probability density h\u03c62 (x)i \u2261 hu2 (\u03c4 )i, where\nZ\nhu2 (\u03c4 )i = u2 P (u, v, \u03c4 )dudv .\nFrom the FPE we obtain a system of equations for the moments\nMk,l = huk v l i ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere k, l = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Substituting uk v l in the FPE and integrating over u and v, one obtains the following relation\nfor Mk,l\n\u1e40k,l = \u2212l\u03c9Mk+1,l\u22121 + kMk\u22121,l+1 + l(l \u2212 1)2DMk+2,l\u22122 + \u03b2lMk+3,l\u22121 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Mk,l with negative indexes are assumed to vanish. We note that only terms with the same parity of k + l are\ncoupled. Since we are interested in M2,0 = hu2 i, we study only the case when this parity is even, namely k + l = 2n\nwith n = 1, 2, . . . . The sum of the indexes of the moments is 2n, except the last term \u03b2lMk+3,l\u22121 , where the sum is\n2(n + 1). This leads to the infinite system of linear equations that can be written in the form\n\u1e40 = WM ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the column vector is M = (M2,0 , M1,1 , M0,2 , M4,0 , M3,1 , . . . ) and W is the corresponding matrix. The matrix\nelements Wk,l are determined by Eq. (6). The solutions of the system of linear equations (7) are linear combinations\nof the eigenfunctions at time \u03c4\nM\u03bb (\u03c4 ) = exp(\u03bb\u03c4 )U\u03bb ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere U\u03bb = M\u03bb (t = 0) is the eigenvector of W corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb found from the equation\nWUm = \u03bbm Um ,\n\nUm \u2261 U\u03bbm .\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nThe infinite matrix W consists of two parts. The first one is independent of \u03b2 and consists of independent diagonal\nblocks An of size (2n + 1) \u00d7 (2n + 1). The second one consists of the \u03b2 dependent terms which couple the n-th\nand the (n + 1)-th blocks and are located above the (n + 1) block and to the right of the n-th block. Consequently,\nthe \u03b2 dependent terms do not affect the characteristic polynomial, as can be shown by elementary operations on\ndeterminants. Therefore, the characteristic polynomial of W reduces to a product of the block determinants [20]\n\u221e\nY\n\nn=1\n\ndet (An \u2212 \u03bbIn ) = 0 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere In is an (2n + 1) \u00d7 (2n + 1) unit matrix. The diagonal block An of the infinite matrix W defined in equation (7),\nthat couples the moments of order 2n with one another, is a band-diagonal square-matrix of size (2n + 1). The explicit\nform of this matrix is given by:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n2n\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212\u03c9\n0\n2n \u2212 1\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n2D\n\u22122\u03c9\n0\n2n \u2212 2\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n6D\n\u22123\u03c9\n0\n2n \u2212 3\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAn = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 (11)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0\n(2n \u2212 2)(2n \u2212 1)D\n\u2212(2n \u2212 1)\u03c9\n0\n1\uf8f8\n0\n(2n \u2212 1)2nD \u22122n\u03c9 0\nLet us denote by \u03bbmax (n) the maximal eigenvalue of this matrix. The vector of the moments in this block is Mn =\n(M2n,0 , M2n\u22121,1 . . . , M2n\u2212l,l , . . . , M0,2n ). In Appendix A it is proven that for \u03c9 = 0 the maximal Lyapunov exponent\n\u03bbmax (n) behaves for large n as\n\u03bbmax (n) \u2243\n\n3 1/3\nD (2n)4/3 .\n4\n\n(12)\n\nThen it is argued and verified numerically that also for other values \u03c9 6= 0 it behaves in this way.\nIII.\n\nASYMPTOTIC GROWTH OF THE MOMENTS\nA.\n\nEigenvalue problem for the moments\n\nTaking into account Eqs. (8) and (9), we present the solution of Eq. (7) as an expansion\nX\nX\nM(\u03c4 ) =\nCm (\u03c4 )Um =\ne\u03bbm \u03c4 cm Um ,\nm\n\n(13)\n\nm\n\nwhere cm \u2261 Cm (\u03c4 = 0). Due to the block structure the eigenvectors are characterized by two indexes m = (n, k),\nwhere n indicates number of block, while k = 1, 2, . . . , 2n + 1 counts elements inside each block. Therefore, the\neigenstates Um \u2261 Un,k are found from the following algorithm. For the block n = 1 there are 3 eigenvalues \u03bb1,k\nwith corresponding eigenvectors \u016a1,k determined by the first block A1 . Therefore, U1,k = (\u016a1,k , O), where O is\nan infinite zero vector. For the second block n = 2 there are 5 eigenvalues \u03bb2,k with corresponding eigenvectors\nU2,k = (R1,k , \u016a2,k , O), where R1,k is a 3 dimensional vector, while \u016a2,k is a 5 dimensional vector, and k = 1, 2, . . . , 5.\nHere \u03bb2,k and \u016a2,k are determined from the second diagonal block matrix A2 , while R1,k is determined by A1 and\nby the corresponding \u03b2-dependent off diagonal block. Continuing this procedure, we obtain 2n + 1 eigenvectors for\n\u03bbn,k in the form\nUn,k = (Rn\u22121,k , \u016an,k , O) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Rn\u22121,k is a (n2 \u2212 1) dimensional vector determined by n \u2212 1 diagonal and off diagonal blocks of the truncated\nmatrix W.\nSummation over m in Eq. (13) is broken into the sum over the block numbers n \u2208 [1, \u221e) and the sum over indexing\ninside each block l \u2208 [0, 2n]. Thus, Eq. (13) reads\nM(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e X\n2n\nX\n\nn=1 l=0\n\ncn,l e\u03bbn,l \u03c4 Un,l .\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\nThe vector M consists of the block vectors Mn : M = (M1 , M2 , . . . , Mn , . . . ), where Mn is a vector of 2n+ 1 elements\ndefined in Eq. (5) and corresponds to the moments of the order of 2n. Therefore, the initial vector at \u03c4 = 0 is\nXX\n(M1 , M2 , . . . , Mn , . . . ) =\n(16)\ncn\u2032 ,l\u2032 Un\u2032 ,l\u2032 .\nn\u2032\n\nl\u2032\n\nAssume that at the initial point \u03c4 = 0, the wave function and its derivative are small, of the order of \u01eb in units of\np\n|\u03c9/\u03b2|. Then, at that point the moments scale as Mn \u223c \u01eb2n with \u01eb arbitrary small. As follows from Eq. (16),\none finds cn,l Un,l \u223c c\u0304n \u01eb2n + o(\u01eb2n ) with bounded c\u0304n for any n, as demonstrated in Appendix B. In the linear case\n(\u03b2 = 0) the growth rate of each moment of the order of 2n corresponding to the n-th block is determined by the\neigenvalue with the largest real part, and we denote it by \u03bbmax (n) \u2261 max(Re \u03bbn,l ), where the maximum is over the\n2n + 1 eigenvalues corresponding to the nth block, indicated by l. As shown in Appendix A, the asymptotic behavior\nof the generalized Lyapunov exponent \u03bbmax (n) when n \u2192 \u221e is given by \u03bbmax (n) \u223c An4/3 , where A = 34 24/3 D1/3 is a\nconstant (see Eq. (12)). The leading contribution to the growth of Mn (\u03c4 ) in the nonlinear case (\u03b2 6= 0) is determined\nby the following sum\nX\n4/3\nM\u0303n (\u03c4 ) =\nc\u0304m \u01eb2m eAm \u03c4 ,\n(17)\nm\u2265n\n\nas is clear from Eqs. (13)\u2013(16).\nB.\n\nResummation\n\nThis series in Eq. (16) has a vanishing radius of convergence and probably has to be interpreted as an asymptotic\nseries. It can be used to study the behavior of M\u0303n (\u03c4 ) after being resummed. Such a resummation is done with the\nhelp of the identity\nZ +\u221e\n1\ndu exp(\u2212u2 + 2Ku) ,\n(18)\nexp(K 2 ) = \u221a\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nknown as the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We can rewrite the above series as follows\nZ +\u221e\nX\n\u221a\n1\ndu exp(\u2212u2 )\u03a6(2u A\u03c4 ) ,\nM\u0303n (\u03c4 ) =\nc\u0304m \u01eb2m exp(Am4/3 \u03c4 ) = \u221a\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\n(19)\n\nm\u2265n\n\nwhere the function \u03a6 is given by\n\u03a6(y) =\n\nX\n\nc\u0304m \u01eb2m exp(m2/3 y) .\n\n(20)\n\nm\u2265n\n\nIf the coefficients c\u0304m do not grow too fast (which we shall assume hereafter) the function \u03a6(y) is well defined at least\nfor small values of y. Note that for the resummation of Eq. (19) it was not crucial that the power of m is 4/3. Such\na resummation can be performed for any power \u1fb1 < 2 replacing 4/3.\nA more explicit resummation procedure for the r.h.s. of equation (17) can be developed with the help of fractional\nderivatives. First, let us expand the exponential function\nexp(A\u03c4 m\n\n4/3\n\n\u221e\nX\nA\u03c4 m4/3\n)=\nk!\n\n\u0001k\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nk=0\n\n2\n\nThen, writing \u01eb2m = em ln \u01eb \u2261 e\u03b6m , we obtain\nM\u0303n (\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(A\u03c4 )k X\nc\u0304m m4k/3 e\u03b6m .\nk!\nk=0\n\n(22)\n\nm\u2265n\n\nWe now introduce the Weyl fractional derivative of order q of a function f (z) by the Weyl integral, see e.g. [32],\nZ z\ndq f (z)\n1\nf (y)dy\n\u2261\n(23)\ndz q\n\u0393(\u2212q) \u2212\u221e (z \u2212 y)1+q\n\n\f5\nwhere for q > 0 the integral should be properly regularized [32, 33], and \u0393(\u2212q) is the gamma function. For f (y) = e\u03bd\u03b6\nit takes the form\ndq e\u03bd\u03b6\n= \u03bd q e\u03bd\u03b6 .\nd\u03b6 q\n\n(24)\n\nSubstitution of Eq. (24) in Eq. (22) with \u03bd = m yields\nM\u0303n (\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(A\u03c4 )k d4k/3 X\nc\u0304m \u01eb2m .\nk! d\u03b6 4k/3\nm\u2265n\nk=0\n\n(25)\n2n\n\nne\nIf c\u0304m are bounded, as shown in Appendix B, by some C\u0304n , the sum in Eq. (25) is bounded by C\u03041\u2212\u01eb\n2 , hence M\u0303n is the\nfractional derivative of some well defined function presented in Eq. (23) with its regularization.\nTherefore, Eqs. (25) and (19) describe the long time asymptotics of the moments. Therefore, Eq. (17) is an\nasymptotic expansion and is a good approximation as long as we sum decreasing terms. The condition is (for\nbounded c\u0304m )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u01eb2m exp Am4/3 \u03c4 > \u01eb2(m+1) exp A(m + 1)4/3 \u03c4 .\n(26)\n\nFor large m this inequality is ln 1\u01eb > 23 A\u03c4 m1/3 with m \u2265 n. Consequently, for the time of the order\n(n)\n\n\u03c4 < \u03c40\n\n\u2261\n\n3 ln(1/\u01eb)\n2 An1/3\n\n(27)\n\nthe n-th moment will be dominated by the leading terms and will grow as in the linear case (\u03b2 = 0).\nC.\n\nThe growth of the second moments\n\nThe second moments are of particular interest for the present work. Their growth for a time that is shorter than\n(1)\nof Eq. (27) is dominated by the leading term, namely M\u03032 = c\u03042 \u01eb2 e\u03bbmax (1)\u03c4 . Consequently, for \u03c4 < \u03c40 ,\n\n(1)\n\u03c40\n\nhu2 i = M2,0 = c\u03042 \u01eb2 e\u03bbmax (1)\u03c4 .\n\n(28)\n\nThis result was verified numerically. Using the analogy between the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation (1) and the\nFokker-Planck equation (4) we identify the generalized Lyapunov exponent \u03bbmax (1) with the growth rate (2) as\nlnh\u03c62 (x)/\u01eb2 i\n> 0.\nx\u2192\u221e \u01eb\u21920\nx\n\n2\u03b3 = \u03bbmax (1) = lim lim\n\n(29)\n\n(1)\n\nFor \u03c4 > \u03c40 , non-linear saturation effects become relevant and the full nonlinear theory should be used.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this work the asymptotic behavior of the generalized Lyapunov exponents of the linear Fokker-Planck equation\n(3) with \u03b2 = 0, was found analytically and is given by Eq. (12). The resulting expression for the moments (17) is\n(n)\ndivergent, but it can be resummed in the form Eqs. (19) or (25). Therefore, for short time \u03c4 < \u03c40 , the first term in\nEq. (17) provides a good approximation of the moments. In particular, for the second moment this result enabled to\nidentify the generalized Lyapunov exponent of the linear system with the asymptotic growth rate for the nonlinear\none, namely\n2\u03b3 = \u03bbmax (1) .\nAccording to the implementation of the \u00e0 la Borland method, as outlined in [20], this is the decay rate of the stationary\nstates of the random nonlinear equation (1), showing that it is independent of the nonlinearity \u03b2.\n\n\f6\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Arkady Pikovsky for instructive comments and criticism of [20].

Following [28] we call\nthis quantity a generalized Lyapunov exponent. By elementary dimensional analysis [28], one finds that the following\nscaling is suggestive,\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u0011\n.\n(A1)\n\u03bbmax (n) = D1/3 Ln\nD2/3\nIn the long time limit the moments of order 2n grow as e\u03bbmax (n)t . In [28], Zillmer and Pikovsky studied \u03bbmax (n) for\ndifferent values of n: they give exact expressions for n = 2, for n \u2192 0 (which corresponds to the usual Lyapunov\nexponent) and consider limiting cases for large values of the dimensionless parameter \u03c9/D2/3 . They also study\nnumerically the behavior of \u03bbmax (n) as n \u2192 \u221e, keeping the dimensionless parameter fixed. They found numerically\nthe scaling law:\n\u03bbmax (n) \u221d n\u03b1\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2243 1.4 .\n\n(A2)\n\nThe fact that the scaling exponent \u03b1 is different from 2, implies deviations from Gaussian behavior and breakdown\nof monoscaling; the consequences of this breakdown of single parameter scaling for conductance distribution were\nstudied by Schomerus and Titov [29]. We also remark that related studies were also carried out in the context of the\nharmonic oscillator with random frequency [30, 31].\nIn this appendix, we study analytically the behavior of the generalized Lyapunov exponents in the limit n \u2192 \u221e.\nFor the special case of \u03c9 = 0, we prove the following asymptotic formula:\n\u03bbmax (n) \u2243\n\n3 1/3\nD (2n)4/3 .\n4\n\n(A3)\n\nWe shall then argue that this behavior remains valid for any finite value of \u03c9.\nWe now outline the proof of the scaling equation (A3) for \u03c9 = 0 by studying the large n behavior of the coefficients\nof the characteristic polynomial P (X) of the matrix An . Recalling that if \u03bbn,1 , . . . \u03bbn,2n+1 are the eigenvalues of An\nwe have\nP (X) =\n\n2n+1\nY\ni=1\n\n2n+1\nX\n\n(X \u2212 \u03bbn,i ) = X 2n+1 \u2212 (\n\ni=1\n\n2n+1\nX\nY\n\u03bbn,i .\n\u03bbn,i )X 2n + (\n\u03bbn,i \u03bbn,j )X 2n\u22121 + . . . +\ni6=j\n\n(A4)\n\ni=1\n\nWe also have \u03bb(n) = maxl (Re \u03bbn,l ). The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial P (X) are symmetric functions\nof the eigenvalues \u03bbn,i . Thanks to the Newton formulae, all these coefficients can be written as linear combinations\nof traces of powers of An . Hence, we have\nP (X) = X 2n+1 \u2212 Tr(An )X 2n +\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n[Tr(An )]2 \u2212 Tr(A2n ) X 2n\u22121 + . . .\n2\n\n(A5)\n\nIn principle, we can obtain the eigenvalues from the traces of the 2n + 1 powers of An . In practice, since we are\ninterested only in the asymptotic behavior of \u03bbmax (n), it will be computed from the traces of high powers. From\nequation (11) we observe that Tr(An ) = 0. In the case \u03c9 = 0, we also have Tr(A2n ) = 0. More generally, for \u03c9 = 0,\nwe can show that Tr(Akn ) 6= 0 only when k is a multiple of 3. Indeed, writing\nAn = d + g\n\n(A6)\n\n\f7\nwith\n0\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\nd=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\n2n\n0\n0 2n \u2212 1\n.\n\n.\n\n0\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec2\n\uf8ec\ng = D\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n..\n. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 1\uf8f8\n0\n\nand\n\n0\n0\n6\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n0\n12\n\n0\n0\n..\n\n.\n\n0\n..\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n2n(2n \u2212 1) 0 0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(A7)\n\nwe obtain\n(d + g)k =\n\nX\n\n(A8)\n\nWk1 ,k2\n\nk1 +k2 =k\n\nwhere Wk1 ,k2 is a product of k factors with k1 factors equal to d and k2 factors equal to g, with k1 + k2 = k (there are\n2k such terms because the matrices d and g do not commute). We remark that d is an upper-diagonal band matrix and\nits non vanishing terms are all on the band located at level +1 above the diagonal. Similarly g is a lower-triangular\nband matrix and its non vanishing terms are all on the band located 2 levels below the diagonal. Therefore a product\nof k1 matrices d and k2 matrices g will have a non-zero diagonal term only if k1 = 2k2 i.e. if k = 3k2 ; hence, k is a\nmultiple of 3. For example, we have\n2n\u22121\nX\n\n1\n\n16n5\n.\n5\n0\nl=1\n(A9)\nMore generally, the terms that contribute to Tr(A3k\n)\nare\nobtained\nby\ntaking\nthe\nproduct\nof\n2k\nfactors\nd\nand\nk\nfactors\nn\n(3k)!\ng written in all possible orders (there are (2k)!k!\nsuch terms):\nTr(A3n ) = Tr(ddg + dgd + gdd) = 3Tr(d2 g) = 3D\n\nTr(A3k\nn )=\n\nX\n\nl(l + 1)(2n \u2212 l + 1)(2n \u2212 l) \u2243 3D(2n)5\n\nZ\n\nx2 (1 \u2212 x)2 dx = D\n\nTr(W2k,k ) = d2k g k + 'permuted terms'\n\n(A10)\n\nIn particular, we have\nTr(d2k g k ) = Dk\n\nX\nl\n\nk\n\nl(l + 1)(l + 2)..(l + 2k \u2212 1)(2n \u2212 l + 1)(2n \u2212 l)...(2n \u2212 l \u2212 2k + 2)\n4k+1\n\n\u2243 D (2n)\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\nx2k (1 \u2212 x)2k dx = Dk (2n)4k+1\n\n(2k)!(2k)!\n.\n(4k + 1)!\n\n(A11)\n\nThe trace of any term W2k,k is given by the same expression at the leading order: indeed, the elements of the matrix\ndg are of order n3 whereas those of the commutator [d, g] are of order n2 . The reason is that both dg and gd are\ntriangular with all nonvanishing matrix elements one level below the diagonal, of the form (dg)l,l\u22121 and (gd)l,l\u22121 . In\nthe center of the matrix, l \u2248 n, a generic term is of the order of n3 + O(n2 ). Therefore both dg and gd are dominated\nby n3 , while [d, g], given by the difference of two such terms is dominated by the O(n2 ) corrections. We know that any\nW2k,k differs from d2k g k by a finite number of commutators. Therefore, Tr(W2k,k ) = Tr(d2k g k )+ subleading terms.\nWe thus have\nTr(A3k\nn ) \u2243\n\nDk (2n)4k+1 (3k)!(2k)!\n.\n(4k + 1)\n(4k)!k!\n\n(A12)\n\nRewriting this trace in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix An , we obtain\n2n+1\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bb3k\nn,i \u2243\n\nDk (2n)4k+1 (3k)!(2k)!\n.\n(4k + 1)\n(4k)!k!\n\n(A13)\n\nBesides, from equation (A12), we deduce that\nh\nik\nTr(A3n )\nTr(A3k\nn )\n\n\u223c nk\u22121 .\n\n(A14)\n\n\f8\n2n\n\n\u03bbmax (n)\n\n10\n40\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n300\n\n15\n101\n257\n347\n443\n544\n650\n761\n876\n1504.7\n\n3D(2n)4/3\n4\u03bbmax (n)\n\n1.077\n1.015\n1.006\n1.003\n1.0021\n1.0022\n1.0018\n1.0016\n1.0013\n1.0010\n\nTABLE I: Behavior of the dominant eigenvalue in the case \u03c9 = 0, D = 1.\n2n\n\n\u03bbmax (n)\n\n10\n40\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n\n3D(2n)4/3\n4\u03bbmax (n)\n\n13.2\n95.9\n248\n336\n431\n530\n635\n745\n\n1.223\n1.072\n1.043\n1.035\n1.031\n1.028\n1.026\n1.023\n\nTABLE II: Behavior of the dominant eigenvalue in the case \u03c9 = 1, D = 1.\n\nThis equation shows that the trace is not dominated by the largest eigenvalue alone: otherwise this 'participation'\nratio would be of order one. Rather, a finite fraction \u03c1 of the eigenvalues has a scaling behavior similar to that of\n3k\n\u03bbmax (n) and we can write: Tr(A3k\n. Thus, we deduce from equation (A13) the following behavior\nn ) \u223c \u03c1n\u03bbmax (n)\n\u03c1n \u03bbmax (n)3k \u2243\n\nDk (2n)4k+1 (3k)!(2k)!\n.\n(4k + 1)\n(4k)!k!\n\n(A15)\n\nFinally, using Stirling formula, we obtain for large k, assuming \u03c1n does not vary strongly with n\n\u03bbmax (n) \u2243 D1/3 (2n)4/3\n\n\u0010 (3k)!(2k)! \u00111/3k\n(4k)!k!\n\n\u2243\n\n3 1/3\nD (2n)4/3 .\n4\n\n(A16)\n\nThis ends the proof of equation (A3) or (12) in the case \u03c9 = 0. In Table I the highest eigenvalue of the matrix An is\ncomputed numerically for various values of 2n up to 2n = 300 (for \u03c9 = 0 and D = 1). The asymptotic scaling given\nin equation (A3) is well satisfied.\nWhen \u03c9 is different from 0, we can still write An as a sum of two matrices as in equation (A6): the upper-diagonal\nmatrix d remains the same as in equation (A7) but the lower-triangular part g \u2032 is now given by the previous g plus\na band-diagonal matrix g2 (\u03c9) (with a band-diagonal at level -1) which contains terms proportional to \u03c9. However,\nin the large n limit (and keeping the value of \u03c9 fixed) the matrix elements of g are much bigger than those of g2 (\u03c9):\nhence g \u2032 \u2243 g up to subdominant contributions and the large n scaling of the maximal eigenvalue is insensitive to \u03c9\nat leading order, therefore equation (A3), derived for \u03c9 = 0, remains true for finite values of \u03c9. In Tables II and III\nwe give numerical results \u03c9 = 1 and \u03c9 = \u22121 (taking D = 1 for both cases). The scaling behavior, proportional to\n(2n)4/3 , is well satisfied and it seems also that the prefactor 3/4 remains correct.\n\n\f9\n2n\n\n3D(2n)4/3\n4\u03bbmax (n)\n\n\u03bbmax (n)\n\n10\n40\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n\n18\n107.5\n267\n358\n455\n557.5\n666\n777\n\n0.900\n0.952\n0.968\n0.972\n0.975\n0.977\n0.980\n0.981\n\nTABLE III: Behavior of the dominant eigenvalue in the case \u03c9 = \u22121, D = 1.\n\nAPPENDIX B: BOUNDNESS OF THE c\u0304n\n\nLet us assume an expansion (of the initial moments (16))\nMn.l =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n+m) 2(n+m)\n\nbn,l\n\n\u01eb\n\n(B1)\n\nm=0\n\nfor the l-th moment of order n as defined after the matrix (11).
