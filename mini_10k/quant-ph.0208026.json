The consequences of such a coupling are threefold. First of\nall, energy may irreversibly be transferred from the system to the environment\nthereby giving rise to the phenomenon of dissipation. In addition, the fluctuating\nforce exerted by the environment on the system causes fluctuations of the system\ndegree of freedom which manifest itself for example as Brownian motion. While\nthese two effects occur both for classical as well as quantum systems, there exists\na third phenomenon which is specific to the quantum world. As a consequence\nof the entanglement between system and environmental degrees of freedom a\ncoherent superposition of quantum states may be destroyed in a process referred\nto as decoherence. This effect is of major concern if one wants to implement a\nquantum computer. Therefore, decoherence is discussed in detail in Chap. 5.\nQuantum computation, however, is by no means the only topic where the\ncoupling to an environment is relevant. In fact, virtually no real system can be\nconsidered as completely isolated from its surroundings. Therefore, the phenomena listed in the previous paragraph play a role in many areas of physics and\nchemistry and a series of methods has been developed to address this situation.\nSome approaches like the master equations discussed in Chap. 2 are particularly\nwell suited if the coupling to the environment is weak, a situation desired in\nquantum computing. On the other hand, in many solid state systems, the environmental coupling can be so strong that weak coupling theories are no longer\nvalid. This is the regime where the path integral approach has proven to be very\nuseful.\nIt would be beyond the scope of this chapter even to attempt to give a complete overview of the use of path integrals in the description of dissipative quantum systems. In particular for a two-level system coupled to harmonic oscillator\ndegrees of freedom, the so-called spin-boson model, quite a number of approximations have been developed which are useful in their respective parameter\nregimes. This chapter rather attempts to give an introduction to path integrals\nfor readers unfamiliar with but interested in this method and its application to\ndissipative quantum systems.\nIn this spirit, Sect. 2 gives an introduction to path integrals. Some aspects\ndiscussed in this section are not necessarily closely related to the problem of\ndissipative systems. They rather serve to illustrate the path integral approach\nand to convey to the reader the beauty and power of this approach. In Sect. 3\n\n\f2\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nwe elaborate on the general idea of the coupling of a system to an environment.\nThe path integral formalism is employed to eliminate the environmental degrees\nof freedom and thus to obtain an effective description of the system degree of\nfreedom. The results provide the basis for a discussion of the damped harmonic\noscillator in Sect. 4. Starting from the partition function we will examine several\naspects of this dissipative quantum system.\nReaders interested in a more in-depth treatment of the subject of quantum\ndissipation are referred to existing textbooks. In particular, we recommend the\nbook by U. Weiss [1] which provides an extensive presentation of this topic\ntogether with a comprehensive list of references. Chapter 4 of [2] may serve as a\nmore concise introduction complementary to the present chapter. Path integrals\nare discussed in a whole variety of textbooks with an emphasis either on the\nphysical or the mathematical aspects. We only mention the book by H. Kleinert\n[3] which gives a detailed discussion of path integrals and their applications in\ndifferent areas.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPath Integrals\nIntroduction\n\nThe most often used and taught approach to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is based on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation which possesses strong ties with the\nthe Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. The nonvanishing Poisson\nbrackets between position and momentum in classical mechanics lead us to introduce noncommuting operators in quantum mechanics. The Hamilton function\nturns into the Hamilton operator, the central object in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nOne of the most important tasks is to find the eigenfunctions of the Hamilton\noperator and the associated eigenvalues. Decomposition of a state into these\neigenfunctions then allows us to determine its time evolution.\nAs an alternative, there exists a formulation of quantum mechanics based\non the Lagrange formalism of classical mechanics with the action as the central concept. This approach, which was developed by Feynman in the 1940's\n[4,5], avoids the use of operators though this does not necessarily mean that the\nsolution of quantum mechanical problems becomes simpler. Instead of finding\neigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian one now has to evaluate a functional integral\nwhich directly yields the propagator required to determine the dynamics of a\nquantum system. Since the relation between Feynman's formulation and classical mechanics is very close, the path integral formalism often has the important\nadvantage of providing a much more intuitive approach as we will try to convey\nto the reader in the following sections.\n2.2\n\nPropagator\n\nIn quantum mechanics, one often needs to determine the solution |\u03c8(t)i of the\ntime-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ni~\n\n\u2202|\u03c8i\n= H|\u03c8i ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n3\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian describing the system. Formally, the solution of (1)\nmay be written as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ni t \u2032\ndt H(t\u2032 ) |\u03c8(0)i .\n(2)\n|\u03c8(t)i = T exp \u2212\n~ 0\nHere, the time ordering operator T is required because the operators corresponding to the Hamiltonian at different times in general due not commute. In the\nfollowing, we will restrict ourselves to time-independent Hamiltonians where (2)\nsimplifies to\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n|\u03c8(t)i = exp \u2212 Ht |\u03c8(0)i .\n(3)\n~\n\nAs the inspection of (2) and (3) demonstrates, the solution of the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation contains two parts: the initial state |\u03c8(0)i which serves as\nan initial condition and the so-called propagator, an operator which contains all\ninformation required to determine the time evolution of the system.\nWriting (3) in position representation one finds\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ni\n\u2032\n(4)\nhx|\u03c8(t)i = dx hx| exp \u2212 Ht |x\u2032 ihx\u2032 |\u03c8(0)i\n~\nor\n\n\u03c8(x, t) =\nwith the propagator\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2032 K(x, t, x\u2032 , 0)\u03c8(x\u2032 , 0)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\nK(x, t, x , 0) = hx| exp \u2212 Ht |x\u2032 i .\n~\n\u2032\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nIt is precisely this propagator which is the central object of Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics. Before discussing the path integral representation\nof the propagator, it is therefore useful to take a look at some properties of the\npropagator.\nInstead of performing the time evolution of the state |\u03c8(0)i into |\u03c8(t)i in one\nstep as was done in equation (3), one could envisage to perform this procedure\nin two steps by first propagating the initial state |\u03c8(0)i up to an intermediate\ntime t1 and taking the new state |\u03c8(t1 )i as initial state for a propagation over\nthe time t \u2212 t1 . This amounts to replacing (3) by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\ni\n(7)\n|\u03c8(t)i = exp \u2212 H(t \u2212 t1 ) exp \u2212 Ht1 |\u03c8(0)i\n~\n~\nor equivalently\n\u03c8(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndx\u2032\u2032 K(x, t, x\u2032\u2032 , t1 )K(x\u2032\u2032 , t1 , x\u2032 , 0)\u03c8(x\u2032 , 0) .\n\nComparing (5) and (8), we find the semigroup property of the propagator\nZ\nK(x, t, x\u2032 , 0) = dx\u2032\u2032 K(x, t, x\u2032\u2032 , t1 )K(x\u2032\u2032 , t1 , x\u2032 , 0) .\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nx\nx\u2032\n\n0\n\nt1\n\nt\n\nFig. 1. According to the semigroup property (9) the propagator K(x, t, x\u2032 , 0) may be\ndecomposed into propagators arriving at some time t1 at an intermediate point x\u2032\u2032 and\npropagators continuing from there to the final point x\n\nThis result is visualized in Fig. 1 where the propagators between space-time\npoints are depicted by straight lines connecting the corresponding two points.\nAt the intermediate time t1 one has to integrate over all positions x\u2032\u2032 . This insight\nwill be of use when we discuss the path integral representation of the propagator\nlater on.\nThe propagator contains the complete information about the eigenenergies\nEn and the corresponding eigenstates |ni. Making use of the completeness of the\neigenstates, one finds from (6)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\ni\n\u2032\n(10)\nK(x, t, x , 0) =\nexp \u2212 En t \u03c8n (x)\u03c8n (x\u2032 )\u2217 .\n~\nn\nHere, the star denotes complex conjugation. Not only does the propagator contain the eigenenergies and eigenstates, this information may also be extracted\nfrom it. To this end, we introduce the retarded Green function\nGr (x, t, x\u2032 , 0) = K(x, t, x\u2032 , 0)\u0398(t)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u0398(t) is the Heaviside function which equals 1 for positive argument t and\nis zero otherwise. Performing a Fourier transformation, one ends up with the\nspectral representation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\ni\ni \u221e\n\u2032\nEt Gr (t)\ndt exp\nGr (x, x , E) = \u2212\n~ 0\n~\n(12)\nX \u03c8n (x)\u03c8n (x\u2032 )\u2217\n=\n,\nE \u2212 En + i\u03b5\nn\nwhere \u03b5 is an infinitely small positive quantity. According to (12), the poles of\nthe energy-dependent retarded Green function indicate the eigenenergies while\nthe corresponding residua can be factorized into the eigenfunctions at positions\nx and x\u2032 .\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n2.3\n\n5\n\nFree Particle\n\nAn important step towards the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics\ncan be made by considering the propagator of a free particle of mass m. The\neigenstates of the corresponding Hamiltonian\nH=\n\np2\n2m\n\n(13)\n\nare momentum eigenstates\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\ni\n\u03c8p (x) = \u221a\npx\n(14)\nexp\n~\n2\u03c0~\nwith a momentum eigenvalue p out of a continuous spectrum.

However, since the propagation in a general potential\n(in the absence of delta function contributions) may be decomposed into a series\nof short-time propagations of a free particle, the result (19) may indeed be employed to construct a representation of the propagator where the classical action\nappears in the exponent. In the prefactor, the action appears in the form shown\nin equation (19) only within the semiclassical approximation (cf. Sect. 2.8) or\nfor potentials where this approximation turns out to be exact.\n\n\f6\n\n2.4\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nPath Integral Representation of Quantum Mechanics\n\nWhile avoiding to go too deeply into the mathematical details, we nevertheless\nwant to sketch the derivation of the path integral representation of the propagator. The main idea is to decompose the time evolution over a finite time t into\nN slices of short time intervals \u2206t = t/N where we will eventually take the limit\nN \u2192 \u221e. Denoting the operator of the kinetic and potential energy by T and V ,\nrespectively, we thus find\n\u0013 \u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015N\n\u0012\ni\ni\n.\nexp \u2212 Ht = exp \u2212 (T + V )\u2206t\n~\n~\n\n(20)\n\nFor simplicity, we will assume that the Hamiltonian is time-independent even\nthough the following derivation may be generalized to the time-dependent case.\nWe now would like to decompose the short-time propagator in (20) into a part\ndepending on the kinetic energy and another part containing the potential energy. However, since the two operators do not commute, we have to exercise\nsome caution. From an expansion of the Baker-Hausdorff formula one finds\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\ni\ni\n1\nexp \u2212 (T + V )\u2206t \u2248 exp \u2212 T \u2206t exp \u2212 V \u2206t + 2 [T, V ](\u2206t)2 (21)\n~\n~\n~\n~\nwhere terms of order (\u2206t)3 and higher have been neglected. Since we are interested in the limit \u2206t \u2192 0, we may neglect the contribution of the commutator\nand arrive at the Trotter formula\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\nN\n(22)\nexp \u2212 (T + V )t = lim [U (\u2206t)]\nN \u2192\u221e\n~\nwith the short time evolution operator\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\ni\nU (\u2206t) = exp \u2212 T \u2206t exp \u2212 V \u2206t .\n~\n~\n\n(23)\n\nWhat we have presented here is, of course, at best a motivation and certainly\ndoes not constitute a mathematical proof.

The discretization of the propagator used in this expression is a consequence of the form (21)\nof the Baker-Hausdorff relation. In lowest order in \u2206t, we could have used a\ndifferent decomposition which would have led to a different discretization of the\npropagator. For a discussion of the mathematical subtleties we refer the reader\nto [8].\nRemarking that the exponent in (26) contains a discretized version of the\naction\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011\nm 2\n\u1e8b \u2212 V (x) ,\n(27)\nds\nS[x] =\n2\n0\n\nwe can write this result in short notation as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ni\nK(xf , t, xi , 0) = Dx exp\nS[x] .\n~\n\n(28)\n\nThe action (27) is a functional which takes as argument a function x(s) and\nreturns a number, the action S[x]. The integral in (28) therefore is a functional\nintegral where one has to integrate over all functions satisfying the boundary\nconditions x(0) = xi and x(t) = xf . Since these functions represent paths, one\nrefers to this kind of functional integrals also as path integral.\nThe three lines shown in Fig. 2 represent the infinity of paths satisfying\nthe boundary conditions. Among them the thicker line indicates a special path\ncorresponding to an extremum of the action. According to the principal of least\naction such a path is a solution of the classical equation of motion. It should be\nnoted, however, that even though sometimes there exists a unique extremum, in\ngeneral there may be more than one or even none. A demonstration of this fact\nwill be provided in Sect. 2.7 where we will discuss the driven harmonic oscillator.\nThe other paths depicted in Fig. 2 may be interpreted as quantum fluctuations around the classical path. As we will see\n\u221a in Sect. 2.8, the amplitude of\nthese fluctuations is typically of the order of ~. In the classical limit ~ \u2192 0\ntherefore only the classical paths survive as one should expect.\n\n\f8\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nx\n\nt\nFig. 2. The thick line represents a classical path satisfying the boundary conditions.\nThe thinner lines are no solutions of the classical equation of motion and may be\nassociated with quantum fluctuations\n\nBefore explicitly evaluating a path integral, we want to discuss two examples\nwhich will give us some insight into the difference of the approaches offered by\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger and Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics.\n2.5\n\nParticle on a Ring\n\nWe confine a particle of mass m to a ring of radius R and denote its angular\ndegree of freedom by \u03c6. This system is described by the Hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\n~2 \u2202 2\n.\n2mR2 \u2202\u03c62\n\n(29)\n\nRequiring the wave function to be continuous and differentiable, one finds the\nstationary states\n1\n\u03c8l (\u03c6) = \u221a exp (il\u03c6)\n(30)\n2\u03c0\nwith l = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . and the eigenenergies\nEl =\n\n~2 l 2\n.\n2mR2\n\n(31)\n\nThese solutions of the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation allow us to construct the propagator\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\n1 X\n~l2\nK(\u03c6f , t, \u03c6i , 0) =\nt .\n(32)\nexp il(\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6i ) \u2212 i\n2\u03c0\n2mR2\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\nWe now want to derive this result within the path integral formalism. To this\nend we will employ the propagator of the free particle. However, an important\ndifference between a free particle and a particle on a ring deserves our attention.\nDue to the ring topology we have to identify all angles \u03c6 + 2\u03c0n, where n is an\ninteger, with the angle \u03c6. As a consequence, there exist infinitely many classical\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n9\n\n\u03c6f\n\n\u03c6f\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03c6i\n\nn=0\n\nn=1\n\nFig. 3. On a ring, the angles \u03c6f and \u03c6f + 2\u03c0n have to be identified. As a consequence,\nthere exist infinitely many classical paths connecting two points on a ring, which may\nbe identified by their winding number n\n\npaths connecting \u03c6i and \u03c6f . All these paths are topologically different and can\nbe characterized by their winding number n. As an example, Fig. 3 shows a path\nfor n = 0 and n = 1. Due to their different topology, these two paths (and any\ntwo paths corresponding to different winding numbers) cannot be continuously\ntransformed into each other. This implies that adding a fluctuation to one of the\nclassical paths will never change its winding number.\nTherefore, we have to sum over all winding numbers in order to account for\nall possible paths. The propagator thus consists of a sum over free propagators\ncorresponding to different winding numbers\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\ni mR2 (\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6i \u2212 2\u03c0n)2\nm\n.\n(33)\nexp\nK(\u03c6f , t, \u03c6i , 0) =\nR\n2\u03c0i~t\n~ 2\nt\nn=\u2212\u221e\nHere, the factor R accounts for the fact that, in contrast to the free particle, the\ncoordinate is given by an angle instead of a position.\nThe propagator (33) is 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6i and can therefore be expressed\nin terms of a Fourier series\nK(\u03c6f , t, \u03c6i , 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\ncl exp [il(\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6i )] .\n\nThe Fourier coefficients are found to read\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n~l2\ncl =\nt\nexp \u2212i\n2\u03c0\n2mR2\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nwhich proves the equivalence of (33) with our previous result (32). We thus\nhave obtained the propagator of a free particle on a ring both by solving the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation and by employing path integral methods. These two approaches make use of complementary representations. In the first case, this is\nthe angular momentum representation while in the second case, one works in\nthe phase representation and sums over winding numbers.\n\n\f10\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\n5\n4\n3\n\n0\n\nxi\n\nxf\n\n2\n1\nL\n\nFig. 4. The reflection at the walls of a box leads to an infinite number of possible\ntrajectories connecting two points in the box\n\n2.6\n\nParticle in a Box\n\nAnother textbook example in standard quantum mechanics is the particle in a\nbox of length L confined by infinitely high walls at x = 0 and x = L.

Here, we have to consider all paths connecting the points xi and\nxf within a period of time t. Due to the reflecting walls, there again exist infinitely\nmany classical paths, five of which are depicted in Fig. 4. However, in contrast to\nthe case of a particle on a ring, these paths are no longer topologically distinct.\nAs a consequence, we may deform a classical path continuously to obtain one of\nthe other classical paths.\nIf, for the moment, we disregard the details of the reflections at the wall, the\nmotion of the particle in a box is equivalent to the motion of a free particle. The\nfact that paths are folded back on themselves can be accounted for by taking\ninto account replicas of the box as shown in Fig. 5. Now, the path does not\n(0)\n(n)\nnecessarily end at xf = xf but at one of the mirror images xf where n is an\narbitrary integer. In order to obtain the propagator, we will have to sum over\nall replicas. Due to the different geometry we need to distinguish between those\npaths arising from an even and an odd number of reflections. From Fig. 5 one\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n11\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n(\u22122)\n\nxf\n\n(\u22121)\n\nxf\n\nxi\n\nxf\n\n(1)\n\nxf\n\n(2)\n\nxf\n\nFig. 5. Instead of a particle getting reflected at the walls of the box one may think of\na free particle moving from the starting point in the box to the end point in one of the\nreplicas of the box\n\ncan see that for an odd number 2n\u22121 of reflections, the end point lies at 2nL\u2212xf\nand the contribution to the full propagator therefore is given by\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni m(2nL \u2212 xf \u2212 xi )2\nm\n(2n\u22121)\n.\n(39)\nK\n(xf , t, xi , 0) =\nexp\n2\u03c0i~t\n~\n2t\nOn the other hand, for an even number 2n of reflections, the end point is located\nat 2nL + xf and we find\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni m(2nL + xf \u2212 xi )2\nm\nK (2n) (xf , t, xi , 0) =\n.\n(40)\nexp\n2\u03c0i~t\n~\n2t\nHowever, it is not obvious that just summing up the propagators (39) and (40)\nfor all n will do the job.\nIn order to clarify this point, we start with the somewhat simpler situation\nof just one wall and take a look at all paths running between xi and xf in time\nt. As can be seen from the space-time diagram in Fig. 6 there are paths which\ndo not cross the wall and which therefore contribute to the path integral. On\nthe other hand, there exist also paths which cross the wall an even number of\ntimes. Since these paths spend some time in the forbidden region, they do not\ncontribute to the path integral.\nIt requires some thinking to ensure that only paths not crossing the wall are\ntaken into account. Our strategy will consist in first writing down a propagator\nKfree which disregards the wall. Then, we have to subtract off the contributions\nof all the paths which cross the wall. This can be done by constructing a path\nwith the same action as the original path. To this end we take the original path\nup to the last crossing with the wall and then continue along the mirror image\nof the original path. We thus end up at the mirror image \u2212xf of the original end\npoint xf . Note that a path running from xi to \u2212xf necessarily crosses the wall\nat least once. As a consequence, subtracting the propagator between these two\npoints eliminates all original paths which do not remain in the region x > 0.\nWe therefore obtain our desired result, the propagator Kwall in the presence of\na wall, by subtracting a propagator going to the reflected end point from the\nunconstrained propagator to the original end point [9,10,11]\nKwall (xf , t, xi , 0) = Kfree (xf , t, xi , 0) \u2212 Kfree (\u2212xf , t, xi , 0) .\n\n(41)\n\n\f12\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nt\n\nx\n\u2212xf\n\n0\n\nxi\n\nxf\n\nFig. 6. A path crossing the wall is cancelled by a path running to the mirror point of\nthe end point\n\nThis result bears much resemblance with the method of image charges in electrostatics. After giving it some thought, this should not be too surprising since\nthe free Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Poisson equation are formally equivalent.\nAccording to the method of image charges one may account for a metallic plate\n(i.e. the wall) by putting a negative charge (i.e. the mirrored end point) complementing the positive charge (i.e. the original end point). For the propagator\nthis results in the difference appearing in (41).\nLet us now come back to our infinitely deep potential well with two walls. This\nproblem corresponds to the electrostatics of a charge between two parallel metal\nplates. In this case, the method of image charges leads to an infinite number\nof charges of alternating signs. The original positive charge gives rise to two\nnegative charges which are each an image corresponding to one of the two metal\nplates. In addition, however, these images have mirror images corresponding to\nthe other metal plate and this process has to be carried on ad infinitum.\nExpressing the propagator of the particle in the box in terms of the free\npropagator works in exactly the same way. A path intersecting both walls is\nsubtracted twice, i.e. one time too often. Therefore, one contribution has to be\nrestored which is done by adding another end point. Continuing the procedure\none ends up with an infinite number of end points, some of which we have shown\nin Fig. 5. As a consequence, we can attribute a sign to each end point in this\nfigure. The general rule which follows from these considerations is that each\nreflection at a wall leads to factor \u22121. The propagator therefore can be written\nas\n\"\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\ni m(2nL + xf \u2212 xi )2\nm\nexp\nK(xf , t, xi , 0) =\n2\u03c0i~t n=\u2212\u221e\n~\n2t\n(42)\n\u0012\n\u0013#\ni m(2nL \u2212 xf \u2212 xi )2\n\u2212 exp\n.\n~\n2t\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n13\n\nThe symmetries\nK(xf + 2L, t, xi , 0) = K(xf , t, xi , 0)\nK(\u2212xf , t, xi , 0) = \u2212K(xf , t, xi , 0)\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nsuggest to expand the propagator into the Fourier series\nK(xf , t, xi , 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0010 x \u0011\nf\n.\naj (xi , t) sin \u03c0j\nL\nj=1\n\nIts Fourier coefficients are obtained from (42) as\nZ\n\u0010 x \u0011\n1 L\nf\naj (xi , t) =\nK(xf , t, xi , 0)\ndxf sin \u03c0j\nL \u2212L\nL\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010 x\u0011\n2\ni\ni\n= sin \u03c0j\nexp \u2212 Ej t\nL\nL\n~\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nwhere the energies Ej are the eigenenergies of the box defined in (36). Inserting\n(46) into (45) we thus recover our previous result (38).\n2.7\n\nDriven Harmonic Oscillator\n\nEven though the situations dealt with in the previous two sections have been conceptually quite interesting, we could in both cases avoid the explicit calculation\nof a path integral. In the present section, we will introduce the basic techniques\nneeded to evaluate path integrals. As an example, we will consider the driven\nharmonic oscillator which is simple enough to allow for an exact solution. In\naddition, the propagator will be of use in the discussion of damped quantum\nsystems in later sections.\nOur starting point is the Lagrangian\nm\nm\nL = \u1e8b2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 x2 + xf (t)\n(47)\n2\n2\nof a harmonic oscillator with mass m and frequency \u03c9. The force f (t) may be\ndue to an external field, e.g. an electric field coupling via dipole interaction to a\ncharged particle. In the context of dissipative quantum mechanics, the harmonic\noscillator could represent a degree of freedom of the environment under the\ninfluence of a force exerted by the system.\nAccording to (28) we obtain the propagator K(xf , t, xi , 0) by calculating the\naction for all possible paths starting at time zero at xi and ending at time t at\nxf . It is convenient to decompose the paths\nx(s) = xcl (s) + \u03be(s)\n\n(48)\n\ninto the classical path xcl satisfying the boundary conditions xcl (0) = xi , xcl (t) =\nxf and a fluctuating part \u03be vanishing at the boundaries, i.e. \u03be(0) = \u03be(t) = 0. The\nclassical path has to satisfy the equation of motion\nm\u1e8dcl + m\u03c9 2 xcl = f (s)\n\n(49)\n\n\f14\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nobtained from the Lagrangian (47).\nFor an exactly solvable problem like the driven harmonic oscillator, we could\nreplace xcl by any path satisfying x(0) = xi , x(t) = xf . We leave it as an\nexercise to the reader to perform the following calculation with xcl (s) of the\ndriven harmonic oscillator replaced by xi + (xf \u2212 xi )s/t. However, it is important\nto note that within the semiclassical approximation discussed in Sect. 2.8 an\nexpansion around the classical path is essential since this path leads to the\ndominant contribution to the path integral.\nWith (48) we obtain for the action\nt\n\n\u0011\nm 2 2\n\u03c9 x + xf (s)\n2\n2\n0\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011 Z t \u0010\n\u0011\nm 2\nm 2 2\n=\nds\n\u1e8bcl \u2212 \u03c9 xcl + xcl f (s) +\nds m\u1e8bcl \u03be \u0307 \u2212 m\u03c9 2 xcl \u03be + \u03bef (s)\n2\n2\n0\n0\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011\nm  \u03072 m 2 2\n\u03be \u2212 \u03c9 \u03be .\n(50)\n+\nds\n2\n2\n0\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\nds\n\n\u0010m\n\n\u1e8b2 \u2212\n\nFor our case of a harmonic potential, the third term is independent of the boundary values xi and xf as well as of the external driving. The second term vanishes\nas a consequence of the expansion around the classical path.

Since the frequency of the oscillations is independent of the amplitude,\nthe position of the oscillator at these times is determined by the initial position:\nx(T2n+1 ) = \u2212xi and x(T2n ) = xi .

We invite the\nreader to redo the following calculation with the expansion (62) replacing (58).\nWhile at the end the same propagator should be found, it will become clear why\nthe expansion in terms of eigenfunctions satisfying (59) is preferable.\nThe integration over the fluctuations now becomes an integration over the\nexpansion coefficients an .

The operator represented in its eigenbasis yields a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the\ndiagonal. Then, as for finite dimensional matrices, the determinant is the product\nof these eigenvalues.\nEach of the determinants (66) and (67) by itself diverges. However, we are\ninterested in the ratio between them which is well-defined [12]\n\u0012 \u00132 !\n\u221e\nY\n\u03c9t\nsin(\u03c9t)\nD\n1\u2212\n=\n=\n.\n(71)\nD0\n\u03c0n\n\u03c9t\nn=1\n\n\f18\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nInserting this result into (70) leads to the propagator of the driven harmonic\noscillator in its final form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nr\ni\nm\u03c9\nexp Scl\nK(xf , t, xi , 0) =\n2\u03c0i~ sin(\u03c9t)\n~\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(72)\nr\n\u0010\u03c0\nm\u03c9\n\u03c0\u0011\ni\n=\nexp Scl \u2212 i\n+n\n2\u03c0~| sin(\u03c9t)|\n~\n4\n2\nwith the classical action defined in (56). The Morse index n in the phase factor is\ngiven by the integer part of \u03c9t/\u03c0. This phase accounts for the changes in sign of\nthe sine function [13]. Here, one might argue that it is not obvious which sign of\nthe square root one has to take. However, the semigroup property (9) allows to\nconstruct propagators across conjugate points by joining propagators for shorter\ntime intervals. In this way, the sign may be determined unambiguously [14].\nIt is interesting to note that the phase factor exp(\u2212in\u03c0/2) in (72) implies that\nK(xf , 2\u03c0/\u03c9, xi , 0) = \u2212K(xf , 0, xi , 0) = \u2212\u03b4(xf \u2212 xi ), i.e. the wave function after\none period of oscillation differs from the original wave function by a factor \u22121.\nThe oscillator thus returns to its original state only after two periods very much\nlike a spin-1/2 particle which picks up a sign under rotation by 2\u03c0 and returns\nto its original state only after a 4\u03c0-rotation. This effect might be observed in\nthe case of the harmonic oscillator by letting interfere the wave functions of two\noscillators with different frequency [15].\n2.8\n\nSemiclassical Approximation\n\nThe systems considered so far have been special in the sense that an exact\nexpression for the propagator could be obtained. This is a consequence of the\nfact that the potential was at most quadratic in the coordinate. Unfortunately,\nin most cases of interest the potential is more complicated and apart from a few\nexceptions an exact evaluation of the path integral turns out to be impossible.\nTo cope with such situations, approximation schemes have been devised. In the\nfollowing, we will restrict ourselves to the most important approximation which\nis valid whenever the quantum fluctuations are small or, equivalently, when the\nactions involved are large compared to Planck's constant so that the latter may\nbe considered to be small.\nThe decomposition of a general path into the classical path and fluctuations\naround it as employed in (48) in the previous section was merely a matter of\nconvenience. For the exactly solvable case of a driven harmonic oscillator it\nis not really relevant how we express a general path satisfying the boundary\nconditions. Within the semiclassical approximation, however, it is decisive to\nexpand around the path leading to the dominant contribution, i.e. the classical\npath. From a more mathematical point of view, we have to evaluate a path\nintegral over exp(iS/~) for small ~. This can be done in a systematic way by the\nmethod of stationary phase where the exponent has to be expanded around the\nextrema of the action S.\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n19\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nRe exp(i\u03b1x2 )\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n\u221a\nx/ \u03b1\n\nFig. 8. In stationary phase approximation only a small region around the extremum\ncontributes to the integral. For the example shown here, the extremum lies at x = 0\n\nAt this point it may be useful to give a brief reminder of the method of\nstationary phase. Suppose we want to evaluate the integral\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\nI(\u03b1) =\ndxg(x) exp i\u03b1f (x)\n(73)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nin the limit of very large \u03b1. Inspection of Fig. 8, where f (x) = x2 , suggests that\nthe dominant\n\u221a contribution to the integral comes from a region, in our example\nof size 1/ \u03b1, around the extremal (or stationary) point of the function f (x).\nOutside of this region, the integrand is rapidly oscillating and therefore gives to\nleading order a negligible contribution. Since for large \u03b1, the region determining\nthe integral is very small, we may expand the function f (x) locally around the\nextremum x0\n1\nf (x) \u2248 f (x0 ) + f \u2032\u2032 (x0 )(x \u2212 x0 )2 + . . .\n(74)\n2\nand replace g(x) by g(x0 ). Neglecting higher order terms, which is allowed if\nf \u2032\u2032 (x0 ) is of order one, we are left with the Gaussian integral\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u0001 \u221e\ni \u2032\u2032\n2\nI(\u03b1) \u2248 g(x0 ) exp i\u03b1f (x0 )\ndx exp f (x0 )(x \u2212 x0 )\n2\n\u2212\u221e\ns\n(75)\nh\n\u0001i\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u2032\u2032\n=\ng(x0 ) exp i\u03b1f (x0 ) + i sgn f (x0 ) ,\n|f \u2032\u2032 (x0 )|\n4\n\nwhere sgn(f \u2032\u2032 (x0 )) denotes the sign of f \u2032\u2032 (x0 ). If f (x) possesses more than one\nextremum, one has to sum over the contributions of all extrema unless one\nextremum can be shown to be dominant.\nWe now apply the stationary phase approximation to path integrals where\n1/~ plays the role of the large parameter. Since the action is stationary at classical paths, we are obliged to express the general path as\nx(s) = xcl (s) + \u03be(s) ,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere xcl is the classical path (or one of several possible paths) satisfying the\nboundary conditions and \u03be represents the fluctuations around the classical path.\n\n\f20\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nWith this decomposition the action becomes\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011\nm 2\n\u1e8b \u2212 V (x)\nS=\nds\n2\n0\nZ t \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011 Z t \u0010\nm 2\nds\n=\nds m\u1e8bcl \u03be \u0307 \u2212 V \u2032 (xcl )\u03be\n\u1e8bcl \u2212 V (xcl ) +\n2\n0\n0\n\u0013\nZ t \u0012\nm 2 1 \u2032\u2032\nds\n+\n\u03be\u0307 \u2212 V (xcl )\u03be 2 + . . .\n2\n2\n0\n\n(77)\n\nIt is instructive to compare this result with the action (50) for the driven harmonic oscillator. Again, the first term represents the classical action. The second\nterm vanishes as was shown explicitly in (51) for the driven oscillator. In the\ngeneral case, one can convince oneself by partial integration of the kinetic part\nand comparison with the classical equation of motion that this term vanishes\nagain. This is of course a consequence of the fact that the classical path, around\nwhich we expand, corresponds to an extremum of the action. The third term on\nthe right-hand-side of (77) is the leading order term in the fluctuations as was\nthe case in (50). There is however an important difference since for anharmonic\npotentials the second derivative of the potential V \u2032\u2032 is not constant and therefore the contribution of the fluctuations depends on the classical path. Finally,\nin general there will be higher order terms in the fluctuations as indicated by the\ndots in (77). The semiclassical approximation consists in neglecting these higher\norder terms so that after a partial integration, we get for the action\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nd2\n1 t\n(78)\nds \u03be m 2 + V \u2032\u2032 (xcl ) \u03be\nSsc = Scl \u2212\n2 0\nds\nwhere the index 'sc' indicates the semiclassical approximation.\nBefore deriving the propagator in semiclassical approximation, we have to\ndiscuss the regime of validity of this approximation. Since the first term in (78)\ngives only rise to a global phase factor, it is the second term which determines the\nmagnitude of the quantum fluctuations. For this term to contribute, we should\nhave \u03be 2 /~ . 1 so that the magnitude of typical fluctuations is at most of order\n\u221a\n~. The term of third order\nis already smaller than the second\n\u221a\n\u221a in the fluctuations\norder term by a factor ( ~)3 /~ = ~. If Planck's constant can be considered\nto be small, we may indeed neglect the fluctuation contributions of higher than\nsecond order except for one exception: It may happen that the second order term\ndoes not contribute, as has been the case at the conjugate points for the driven\nharmonic oscillator in Sect. 2.7. Then, the leading nonvanishing contribution\nbecomes dominant. For the following discussion, we will not consider this latter\ncase.\nIn analogy to Sect. 2.7 we obtain for the propagator in semiclassical approximation\nr\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\nm\nD0\nexp\nScl\n(79)\nK(xf , t, xi , 0) =\n2\u03c0i~t D\n~\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\nwhere\n\n21\n\n\u0013\nd2\n\u2032\u2032\n+ V (xcl )\n(80)\nD = det\nds2\nand D0 is the fluctuation determinant (67) of the free particle.\nEven though it may seem that determining the prefactor is a formidable task\nsince the fluctuation determinant for a given potential has to be evaluated, this\ntask can be greatly simplified. In addition, the following considerations offer the\nbenefit of providing a physical interpretation of the prefactor. In our evaluation\nof the prefactor we follow Marinov [16]. The main idea is to make use of the\nsemigroup property (9) of the propagator\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni\nC(xf , t, xi , 0) exp Scl (xf , t, xi , 0)\n(81)\n~\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u0003\ni\u0002\nScl (xf , t, x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) + Scl (x\u2032 , t\u2032 , xi , 0)\n= dx\u2032 C(xf , t, x\u2032 , t\u2032 )C(x\u2032 , t\u2032 , xi , 0) exp\n~\n\u0012\n\nwhere the prefactor C depends on the fluctuation contribution. We now have\nto evaluate the x\u2032 -integral within the semiclassical approximation. According to\nthe stationary phase requirement discussed above, the dominant contribution to\nthe integral comes from x\u2032 = x0 (xf , xi , t, t\u2032 ) satisfying\n\u2202Scl (xf , t, x\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\u2202x\u2032\n\n+\nx\u2032 =x0\n\n\u2202Scl (x\u2032 , t\u2032 , xi , 0)\n\u2202x\u2032\n\n=0.\n\n(82)\n\nx\u2032 =x0\n\nAccording to classical mechanics these derivatives are related to initial and final\nmomentum by [17]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Scl\n\u2202Scl\n= \u2212pi\n= pf\n(83)\n\u2202xi xf ,tf ,ti\n\u2202xf xi ,tf ,ti\nso that (82) can expressed as\np(t\u2032 \u2212 \u03b5) = p(t\u2032 + \u03b5) .\n\n(84)\n\nThe point x0 thus has to be chosen such that the two partial classical paths\ncan be joined with a continuous momentum. Together they therefore yield the\ncomplete classical path and in particular\nScl (xf , t, xi , 0) = Scl (xf , t, x0 , t\u2032 ) + Scl (x0 , t\u2032 , xi , 0) .\n\n(85)\n\nThis relation ensures that the phase factors depending on the classical actions\non both sides of (81) are equal.\nAfter having identified the stationary path, we have to evaluate the integral\nover x\u2032 in (81).

We had encountered such a phase factor before in the propagator (72) of\nthe harmonic oscillator.\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n23\n\nAs we have already mentioned above, derivatives of the action with respect\nto position are related to momenta.

In our discussion\nof the free particle in Sect. 2.3 we already mentioned that the propagator can\nbe expressed entirely in terms of classical quantities. Indeed, the expression (19)\nfor the propagator of the free particle agrees with (92).\nFor the harmonic oscillator, we know from Sect. 2.7 that the prefactor does\nnot depend on a possibly present external force. We may therefore consider the\naction (56) in the absence of driving f (s) = 0 which then reads\nScl =\n\n\u0003\n\u0001\nm\u03c9 \u0002 2\nxi + x2f cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 2xi xf .\n2 sin(\u03c9t)\n\n(94)\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to xi and xf one finds for the prefactor\nC(xf , t, xi , 0) =\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03c9\n2\u03c0i~ sin(\u03c9t)\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(95)\n\nwhich is identical with the prefactor in our previous result (72). As expected,\nfor potentials at most quadratic in the coordinate the semiclassical propagator\nagrees with the exact expression.\n2.9\n\nImaginary Time Path Integral\n\nIn the discussion of dissipative systems we will be dealing with a system coupled to a large number of environmental degrees of freedom. In most cases, the\nenvironment will act like a large heat bath characterized by a temperature T .\nThe state of the environment will therefore be given by an equilibrium density\nmatrix. Occasionally, we may also be interested in the equilibrium density matrix of the system itself. Such a state may be reached after equilibration due to\nweak coupling with a heat bath.\nIn order to describe such thermal equilibrium states and the dynamics of\nthe system on a unique footing, it is desirable to express equilibrium density\nmatrices in terms of path integrals. This is indeed possible as one recognizes by\nwriting the equilibrium density operator in position representation\n\u03c1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 ) =\n\n1\nhx| exp(\u2212\u03b2H)|x\u2032 i\nZ\n\n(96)\n\n\f24\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nwith the partition function\nZ=\n\nZ\n\ndxhx| exp(\u2212\u03b2H)|xi .\n\nComparing with the propagator in position representation\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\nK(x, t, x\u2032 , 0) = hx| exp \u2212 Ht |x\u2032 i\n~\n\n(97)\n\n(98)\n\none concludes that apart from the partition function the equilibrium density\nmatrix is equivalent to a propagator in imaginary time t = \u2212i~\u03b2.\nAfter the substitution \u03c3 = is the action in imaginary time \u2212i~\u03b2 reads\n#\n\" \u0012 \u0013\n#\nZ ~\u03b2\nZ \u2212i~\u03b2 \" \u0012 \u00132\n2\nm dx\nm dx\n\u2212 V (x) = i\nd\u03c3\n+ V (x) .\n(99)\nds\n2 ds\n2 d\u03c3\n0\n0\nHere and in the following, we use greek letters to indicate imaginary times.\nMotivated by the right-hand side of (99) we define the so-called Euclidean action\nZ ~\u03b2\ni\nhm\n\u1e8b2 + V (x) .\n(100)\nS E [x] =\nd\u03c3\n2\n0\nEven though one might fear a lack of intuition for motion in imaginary time, this\nresults shows that it can simply be thought of as motion in the inverted potential\nin real time. With the Euclidean action (100) we now obtain as an important\nresult the path integral expression for the (unnormalized) equilibrium density\nmatrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ x\u0304(~\u03b2)=x\n1 E\n\u2032\nhx| exp(\u2212\u03b2H)|x i =\nDx\u0304 exp \u2212 S [x\u0304] .\n(101)\n~\nx\u0304(0)=x\u2032\n\nThis kind of functional integral was discussed as early as 1923 by Wiener [21] in\nthe context of classical Brownian motion.\nAs an example we consider the (undriven) harmonic oscillator. There is actually no need to evaluate a path integral since we know already from Sect. 2.7\nthe propagator\n\u0015\n\u0014\nr\nm\u03c9 (x2i + x2f ) cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 2xi xf\nm\u03c9\n.

A possible approach\nis the one we just have sketched. By means of an imaginary time path integral\none first calculates hx| exp(\u2212\u03b2H)|xi which is proportional to the probability to\nfind the system at position x. Subsequent integration over coordinate space then\nyields the partition function.\nHowever, the partition function may also be determined in one step. To this\nend, we expand around the periodic trajectory with extremal Euclidean action\nwhich in our case is given by x(\u03c3) = 0. Any deviation will increase both the\nkinetic and potential energy and thus increase the Euclidean action. All other\ntrajectories contributing to the partition function are generated by a Fourier\nseries on the imaginary time interval from 0 to ~\u03b2\n#\n\"\n\u221e\n\u221a X\n\u0001\n1\n(106)\nan cos(\u03bdn \u03c3) + bn sin(\u03bdn \u03c3)\nx(\u03c3) = \u221a\na0 + 2\n~\u03b2\nn=1\nwhere we have introduced the so-called Matsubara frequencies\n\u03bdn =\n\n2\u03c0\nn.\n~\u03b2\n\n(107)\n\nThis ansatz should be compared with (62) for the fluctuations where a0 was\nfixed because the fluctuations had to vanish at the boundaries. For the partition\nfunction this requirement is dropped since we have to integrate over all periodic\ntrajectories. Furthermore, we note that indeed with the ansatz (106) only the\nperiodic trajectories contribute. All other paths cost an infinite amount of action\ndue to the jump at the boundary as we will see shortly.\nInserting the Fourier expansion (106) into the Euclidean action of the harmonic oscillator\nZ ~\u03b2\n\u0001\nm 2\n(108)\n\u1e8b + \u03c9 2 x2\nSE =\nd\u03c3\n2\n0\nwe find\n\"\n#\n\u221e\nm 2 2 X 2\n2\n2\n2\nE\n\u03c9 a0 +\n(\u03bdn + \u03c9 )(an + bn ) .\n(109)\nS =\n2\nn=1\nAs in Sect. 2.7 we do not want to go into the mathematical details of integration\nmeasures and Jacobi determinants. Unfortunately, the free particle cannot serve\nas a reference here because its partition function does not exist. We therefore\ncontent ourselves with remarking that because of\n\u221e\n1\n~\u03b2\n1 Y\n1\n= P\u221e 2\n\u03c9 n=1 \u03bdn2 + \u03c9 2\n2\nsinh(~\u03b2\u03c9/2)\n\u03bd\nn=1 n\n\n(110)\n\n\f26\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nthe result of the Gaussian integral over the Fourier coefficients yields the partition function up to a frequency independent factor. This enables us to determine\nthe partition function in more complicated cases by proceeding as above and using the partition function harmonic oscillator as a reference.\nReturning to the density matrix of the harmonic oscillator we finally obtain\nby inserting the partition function (104) into the expression (103) for the density\nmatrix\ns\nm\u03c9 cosh(~\u03b2\u03c9) \u2212 1\n(111)\n\u03c1\u03b2 (x, x\u2032 ) =\n\u03c0~ sinh(~\u03b2\u03c9)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm\u03c9 (x2 + x\u20322 ) cosh(~\u03b2\u03c9) \u2212 2xx\u2032\n.\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n2~\nsinh(~\u03b2\u03c9)\nWithout path integrals, this result would require the evaluation of sums over\nHermite polynomials.\nThe expression for the density matrix (111) can be verified in the limits of\nhigh and zero temperature. In the classical limit of very high temperatures, the\nprobability distribution in real space is given by\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2m\u03c9 2\nm\u03c9 2 2\nP (x) = \u03c1\u03b2 (x, x) =\n(112)\nexp \u2212\u03b2\nx \u223c exp[\u2212\u03b2V (x)] .\n2\u03c0\n2\nWe thus have obtained the Boltzmann distribution which depends only on the\npotential energy. The fact that the kinetic energy does not play a role can easily\nbe understood in terms of the path integral formalism. Excursions in a very short\ntime ~\u03b2 cost too much action and are therefore strongly suppressed.\nIn the opposite limit of zero temperature the density matrix factorizes into\na product of ground state wave functions of the harmonic oscillator\n\u0014\u0010\n\u0010 m\u03c9 \u0011\u0015 \u0014\u0010 m\u03c9 \u00111/4\n\u0010 m\u03c9 \u0011\u0015\nm\u03c9 \u00111/4\n2\n\u2032\n(113)\nexp \u2212\nx\nexp \u2212\nx\u20322\nlim \u03c1\u03b2 (x, x ) =\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\u03c0~\n2~\n\u03c0~\n2~\n\nas should be expected.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDissipative Systems\nIntroduction\n\nIn classical mechanics dissipation can often be adequately described by including\na velocity dependent damping term into the equation of motion. Such a phenomenological approach is no longer possible in quantum mechanics where the\nHamilton formalism implies energy conservation for time-independent Hamiltonians. Then, a better understanding of the situation is necessary in order to\narrive at an appropriate physical model.\nA damped pendulum may help us to understand the mechanism of dissipation. The degree of freedom of interest, the elongation of the pendulum, undergoes a damped motion because it interacts with other degrees of freedom, the\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n27\n\nmolecules in the air surrounding the pendulum's mass. We may consider the\npendulum and the air molecules as one large system which, if assumed to be\nisolated from further degrees of freedom, obeys energy conservation. The energy\nof the pendulum alone, however, will in general not be conserved. This single\ndegree of freedom is therefore subject to dissipation arising from the coupling to\nother degrees of freedom.\nThis insight will allow us in the following section to introduce a model for a\nsystem coupled to an environment and to demonstrate explicitly its dissipative\nnature. In particular, we will introduce the quantities needed for a description\nwhich focuses on the system degree of freedom. We are then in a position to\nreturn to the path integral formalism and to demonstrate how it may be employed to study dissipative systems. Starting from the model of system and\nenvironment, the latter will be eliminated to obtain a reduced description for\nthe system alone. This leaves us with an effective action which forms the basis\nof the path integral description of dissipation.\n3.2\n\nEnvironment as Collection of Harmonic Oscillators\n\nA suitable model for dissipative quantum systems should both incorporate the\nidea of a coupling between system and environment and be amenable to an\nanalytic treatment of the environmental coupling. These requirements are met\nby a model which nowadays is often referred to as Caldeira-Leggett model [22,23]\neven though it has been discussed in the literature under various names before for\nharmonic systems [24,25,26,27] and anharmonic systems [28]. The Hamiltonian\nH = HS + HB + HSB\n\n(114)\n\nconsists of three contributions. The Hamiltonian of the system degree of freedom\nHS =\n\np2\n+ V (q)\n2m\n\n(115)\n\nmodels a particle of mass m moving in a potential V . Here, we denote the\ncoordinate by q to facilitate the distinction from the environmental coordinates\nxn which we will introduce in a moment. Of course, the system degree of freedom\ndoes not have to be associated with a real particle but may be quite abstract. In\nfact, a substantial part of the calculations to be discussed in the following does\nnot depend on the detailed form of the system Hamiltonian.\nThe Hamiltonian of the environmental degrees of freedom\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nX\nmn 2 2\np2n\n+\n\u03c9 x\nHB =\n2mn\n2 n n\nn=1\n\n(116)\n\ndescribes a collection of harmonic oscillators. While the properties of the environment may in some cases be chosen on the basis of a microscopic model, this\ndoes not have to be the case. Often, a phenomenological approach is sufficient\nas we will see below. As an example we mention an Ohmic resistor which as a\n\n\f28\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nlinear electric element should be well described by a Hamiltonian of the form\n(116). On the other hand, the underlying mechanism leading to dissipation, e.g.\nin a resistor, may be much more complicated than that implied by the model of\na collection of harmonic oscillators.\nThe coupling defined by the Hamiltonian\nHSB = \u2212q\n\nN\nX\n\ncn xn + q 2\n\nn=1\n\nN\nX\n\nc2n\n2mn \u03c9n2\nn=1\n\n(117)\n\nis bilinear in the position operators of system and environment. There are cases\nwhere the bilinear coupling is realistic, e.g. for an environment consisting of a\nlinear electric circuit like the resistor just mentioned or for a dipolar coupling\nto electromagnetic field modes encountered in quantum optics. Within a more\ngeneral scope, this Hamiltonian may be viewed as linearization of a nonlinear\ncoupling in the limit of weak coupling to the environmental degrees of freedom.\nAs was first pointed out by Caldeira and Leggett, an infinite number of degrees\nof freedom still allows for strong damping even if each environmental oscillator\ncouples only weakly to the system [22,23].\nAn environment consisting of harmonic oscillators as in (116) might be criticized. If the potential V (q) is harmonic, one may pass to normal coordinates and\nthus demonstrate that after some time a revival of the initial state will occur.\nFor sufficiently many environmental oscillators, however, this so-called Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrence time tends to infinity [29]. Therefore, even with a linear environment\nirreversibility becomes possible at least for all practical purposes.\nThe reader may have noticed that in the coupling Hamiltonian (117) a term\nis present which only contains an operator acting in the system Hilbert space\nbut depends on the coupling constants cn . The physical reason for the inclusion\nof this term lies in a potential renormalization introduced by the first term in\n(117). This becomes clear if we consider the minimum of the Hamiltonian with\nrespect to the system and environment coordinates. From the requirement\n\u2202H\n!\n= mn \u03c9n2 xn \u2212 cn q = 0\n\u2202xn\nwe obtain\nxn =\n\ncn\nq.\nmn \u03c9n2\n\n(118)\n\n(119)\n\nUsing this result to determine the minimum of the Hamiltonian with respect to\nthe system coordinate we find\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\u2202H\nc2n\n\u2202V\n\u2202V\n=\n=\n\u2212\ncn xn + q\n.\n2\n\u2202q\n\u2202q\nmn \u03c9 n\n\u2202q\nn=1\nn=1\n\n(120)\n\nThe second term in (117) thus ensures that this minimum is determined by the\nbare potential V (q).\nAfter having specified the model, we now want to derive an effective description of the system alone.

The correlation function (135) appears\nas integral kernel both in master equations as well as in the effective action\nderived below (cf. (168) and (169)).\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n31\n\nIt is remarkable that within a reduced description for the system alone all\nquantities characterizing the environment may be expressed in terms of the spectral density of bath oscillators\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03c0\n\nN\nX\n\nc2n\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9n ) .\n2mn \u03c9n\nn=1\n\n(136)\n\nAs an example, the damping kernel may be expressed in terms of this spectral\ndensity as\n\u03b3(t) =\n\nZ\nN\n2 \u221e d\u03c9 J(\u03c9)\n1 X c2n\ncos(\u03c9\nt)\n=\ncos(\u03c9t) .\nn\nm n=1 mn \u03c9n2\nm 0 \u03c0 \u03c9\n\n(137)\n\nFor practical calculations, it is therefore unnecessary to specify all parameters\nmn , \u03c9n and cn appearing in (116) and (117). It rather suffices to define the\nspectral density J(\u03c9).\nThe most frequently used spectral density\nJ(\u03c9) = m\u03b3\u03c9\n\n(138)\n\nis associated with the so-called Ohmic damping. This term is sometimes employed to indicate a proportionality to frequency merely at low frequencies instead of over the whole frequency range. In fact, in any realistic situation the\nspectral density will not increase like in (138) for arbitrarily high frequencies.\nIt is justified to use the term \"Ohmic damping\" even if (138) holds only below a certain frequency provided this frequency is much higher than the typical\nfrequencies appearing in the system dynamics.\nFrom (137) one finds the damping kernel for Ohmic damping\n\u03b3(t) = 2\u03b3\u03b4(t) ,\n\n(139)\n\nwhich renders (126) memory-free. We thus recover the velocity proportional\ndamping term familiar from classical damped systems. It should be noted that\nthe factor of two in (139) disappears upon integration in (126) since (137) implies\nthat the delta function is symmetric around zero.\nAt this point, we want to briefly elucidate the origin of the term \"Ohmic\ndamping\". Let us consider the electric circuit shown in Fig. 9 consisting of a\nresistance R, a capacitance C and an inductance L. Summing up the voltages\naround the loop, one obtains as equation of motion for the charge Q on the\ncapacitor\nQ\n=0,\n(140)\nLQ\u0308 + RQ\u0307 +\nC\nwhich shows that an Ohmic resistor leads indeed to memoryless damping. These\nconsiderations demonstrate that even without knowledge of the microscopic origin of dissipation in a resistor, we may employ the Ohmic spectral density (138)\nto account for its dissipative nature.\n\n\f32\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nR\nC\nL\nFig. 9. LC oscillator with Ohmic damping due to a resistor R\n\nThe spectral density (138) for Ohmic damping unfortunately diverges at high\nfrequencies which, as already mentioned, cannot be the case in practice. Even\nin theoretical considerations this feature of strictly Ohmic damping may lead\nto divergencies and a cutoff is needed for regularization. One possibility is the\nDrude cutoff, where the spectral density\nJ(\u03c9) = m\u03b3\u03c9\n\n\u03c92\n\n2\n\u03c9D\n2\n+ \u03c9D\n\n(141)\n\nabove frequencies of the order of \u03c9D is suppressed. The corresponding damping\nkernel reads\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b3\u03c9D exp(\u2212\u03c9D |t|) .\n(142)\n\n\u22121\nThis leads to memory effects in (126) for short times t < \u03c9D\n. For the long-time\nbehaviour, however, only the Ohmic low frequency behaviour of the spectral\ndensity (141) is relevant. If a Drude cutoff is introduced for technical reasons, the\ncutoff frequency \u03c9D should be much larger than all other frequencies appearing\nin the problem in order to avoid spurious effects.\nThe relation (136) between the spectral density and the \"microscopic\" parameters implies that one may set cn = mn \u03c9n2 without loss of generality since\nthe frequencies \u03c9n and the oscillator strengths c2n /2mn \u03c9n can still be freely\nchosen. This special choice for the coupling constants has the advantage of a\ntranslationally invariant coupling [31]\n\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nX\nmn 2\np2n\n2\n+\n\u03c9 (xn \u2212 q)\n.\nH = HS +\n2mn\n2 n\nn=1\n\n(143)\n\nFurthermore, we now can determine the total mass of environmental oscillators\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\nmn =\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\n\nJ(\u03c9)\n.\n\u03c93\n\n(144)\n\nIf the spectral density of bath oscillators at small frequencies takes the form\nJ(\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9 \u03b1 , the total mass of bath oscillators is infinite for \u03b1 \u2264 2. In particular,\nthis includes the case of Ohmic damping where a free damped particle executes\na diffusive motion. In contrast, for \u03b1 > 2, the total mass is finite. In this case,\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n33\n\nthe particle will behave for long times like it were free albeit possessing a renormalized mass due to the environmental coupling [32]. We emphasize that the\ndivergence of the total mass for \u03b1 \u2264 2 is due to an infrared divergence and\ntherefore independent of a high-frequency cutoff.\nIt is also useful to express the potential renormalization introduced in (117) in\nterms of the spectral density of bath oscillators. From (136) it is straightforward\nto obtain\nZ\nN\nX\nq2 \u221e\nJ(\u03c9)\nc2n\n2\n=\n.\n(145)\nd\u03c9\nq\n2\n2m\n\u03c9\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\nn n\n0\nn=1\nThis term is infinite for strictly Ohmic damping but becomes finite when a highfrequency cutoff is introduced.\nFinally, one finds for the noise correlation function (132)\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n~\u03b2\u03c9\nd\u03c9\ncos(\u03c9t) \u2212 i sin(\u03c9t) .

For Ohmic damping this implies delta correlated, i.e. white, noise.\nIn the quantum case, the noise correlation function is complex and can be\ndecomposed into its real and imaginary part\nK(t) = K \u2032 (t) + iK \u2032\u2032 (t) .\n\n(148)\n\nEmploying once more (137), one immediately finds that the imaginary part is\nrelated to the time derivative of the damping kernel by\nK \u2032\u2032 (t) =\n\nm~ d\u03b3\n.\n2 dt\n\n(149)\n\nFor Ohmic damping, the real part reads\nK \u2032 (t) = \u2212\n\n\u03c0m\u03b3\n(~\u03b2)2\n\nsinh2\n\n1\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0t\n~\u03b2\n\n\u0013\n\n(150)\n\nwhich implies that at zero temperature the noise is correlated even for long times.\nThe noise correlation then only decays algebraically like 1/t2 much in contrast\nto the classical result (147).\n3.3\n\nEffective Action\n\nIn the previous section we had eliminated the environmental degrees of freedom\nto obtain the effective equation of motion (126) for the system degree of freedom\n\n\f34\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nalone. This section will be devoted to a discussion of the corresponding procedure\nwithin the path integral formalism.\nWe start to illustrate the basic idea by considering the time evolution of the\nfull density matrix of system and environment\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\nW (qf , xnf , qf , xnf , t) = dqi dqi\u2032 dxni dx\u2032ni K(qf , xnf , t, qi , xni , 0)\n(151)\n\u00d7 W (qi , xni , qi\u2032 , x\u2032ni , 0)K \u2217 (qf\u2032 , x\u2032nf , t, qi\u2032 , x\u2032ni , 0)\n\nwhich is induced by the two propagators K. Here, the coordinates q and xn\nrefer again to the system and bath degrees of freedom, respectively. The environment is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium described by the density matrix\nW\u03b2B while the system may be in a nonequilibrium state \u03c1. If we neglect initial\ncorrelations between system and environment, i.e. if we switch on the coupling\nafter preparation of the initial state, the initial density matrix may be written\nin factorized form\nW (qi , xni , qi\u2032 , x\u2032ni , 0) = \u03c1(qi , qi\u2032 )W\u03b2B (xni , x\u2032ni ) .\n\n(152)\n\nSince we are only interested in the dynamics of the system degree of freedom,\nwe trace out the environment. Then the time evolution may be expressed as\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c1(qf , qf , t) = dqi dqi\u2032 J(qf , qf\u2032 , t, qi , qi\u2032 , 0)\u03c1(qi , qi\u2032 )\n(153)\nwith the propagating function\nZ\nJ(qf , qf\u2032 , t, qi , qi\u2032 , 0) = dxnf dxni dx\u2032ni K(qf , xnf , t, qi , xni , 0)\n\n(154)\n\n\u00d7 W\u03b2B (xni , x\u2032ni )K \u2217 (qf\u2032 , xnf , t, qi\u2032 , x\u2032ni , 0) .\n\nHere, the trace has been performed by setting xnf = x\u2032nf and integrating over\nthese coordinates. The propagators may be expressed as real time path integrals\nwhile the equilibrium density matrix of the bath is given by a path integral in\nimaginary time. Performing the path integrals and the conventional integrals\nappearing in (154) one finds a functional depending on the system path. The\nimportant point is that this functional contains all information about the environment required to determine the system dynamics.\nFor factorizing initial conditions, the propagating function J has been calculated by Feynman and Vernon [33] on the basis of the Hamiltonian (114). More\ngeneral initial conditions taking into account correlations between system and\nenvironment may be considered as well [34].\nInstead of deriving the propagating function we will demonstrate how to\ntrace the environment out of the equilibrium density matrix of system plus environment. While this task is conceptually similar and leads to the same physical\ninsight, it is considerably less tedious.\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n35\n\nWe start from the imaginary time path integral representation of the full\nequilibrium density matrix\n!\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nN\nY\n1 E\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(155)\nDq\u0304\nDx\u0304n exp \u2212 S [q\u0304, x\u0304n ]\nW\u03b2 (q, xn , q , xn ) =\nZ\u03b2\n~\nn=1\nwhere the paths run from q\u0304(0) = q \u2032 and x\u0304n (0) = x\u2032n to q\u0304(~\u03b2) = q and x\u0304n (~\u03b2) =\nxn .

Here, the partition function Z should not be confused with the\npartition function Z\u03b2 of system plus environment. The relation between the two\nquantities will be discussed shortly.\nSince the bath oscillators are not coupled among each other, the influence\nfunctional may be decomposed into factors corresponding to the individual bath\noscillators\nN\nY\n1\nFn [q\u0304]\n(162)\nF [q\u0304] =\nZ\nn=1 n\n\n\f36\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nwhere\n\n1\n(163)\n2 sinh (~\u03b2\u03c9n /2)\nis the partition function of a single bath oscillator.

In the limit of vanishing coupling, cn = 0,\nthe influence functional becomes F [q\u0304] = 1 so that (161) reduces to the path\nintegral representation of the density matrix of an isolated system as it should.\nApart from the potential renormalization term proportional to q\u0304 2 , the action\n(165) describes a driven harmonic oscillator.

Noting that due to the region of integration in\n(167) only half of the delta function contributes, this local term just cancels the\npotential renormalization (145).

In view of (176) and (177) we can\nfinally express the kernel as\nk(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nm X\n|\u03bdl |\u03b3\u0302(|\u03bdl |) exp(i\u03bdl \u03c4 ) .\n~\u03b2\n\n(178)\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\nFor strictly Ohmic damping, this kernel is highly singular and we therefore introduce a Drude cutoff.

This reminds us of the algebraic decay of the real\npart (150) of the noise correlation function K(t) and in fact it follows from our\nprevious discussion that up to the periodic delta function appearing in (180) the\nkernel k(\u03c4 ) equals \u2212K(\u2212i\u03c4 ).\nSummarizing this calculation we obtain the important result that the influence of the environment on the system may be taken into account by adding a\nnonlocal contribution to the action. We then obtain the effective action\nZ ~\u03b2\nZ\n1 ~\u03b2\nE\nSeff\n[q\u0304] = SSE [q\u0304] +\nd\u03c3 k(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)q\u0304(\u03c4 )q\u0304(\u03c3)\n(181)\nd\u03c4\n2 0\n0\nwith k(\u03c4 ) given by (178). The elimination of the environment within the real\ntime path integral formalism, e.g. along the lines of the calculation by Feynman\nand Vernon [33] mentioned at the beginning of this section, would have led to an\neffective action of a structure similar to (181). An important difference consists\nin the fact that the propagation of a density matrix involves two paths instead\nof one. In addition, the integral kernel then of course appears in its real time\nversion.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDamped Harmonic Oscillator\nPartition Function\n\nIn this final section we will apply the results of the previous sections to the\ndamped harmonic oscillator where exact results may be obtained analytically.\nThe Hamiltonian describing system and environment is given by (114)\u2013(117)\nwith the potential\nm\n(182)\nV (q) = \u03c902 q 2 .\n2\nAs we have seen in Sect. 3.2, there is no point in dealing with all the microscopic\nparameters present in the Hamiltonians (116) and (117). Instead, it is sufficient\nto specify the spectral density of bath oscillators (136). In the following, we\nwill mostly assume Ohmic damping, i.e. J(\u03c9) = m\u03b3\u03c9, and introduce a highfrequency cutoff of the Drude type (141) when necessary.\nIn the general discussion of dissipative quantum systems we have concentrated on imaginary time calculations and we will therefore try to take this\napproach as a starting point of the following considerations. Probably the most\nimportant quantity which can be obtained in imaginary time is the partition\n\n\f40\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nfunction which in statistical mechanics can be viewed as a generating function\nfor expectation values. Based on our previous discussion of the partition function of the undamped harmonic oscillator in Sect. 2.9 and the effective action in\nimaginary time in Sect. 3.3, it is rather straightforward to obtain the partition\nfunction of the damped harmonic oscillator.\nAccording to (104) and (110) we can express the partition function of the\nundamped harmonic oscillator as\n\u221e\n\u03bdn2\n1 Y\n.\nZu =\n~\u03b2\u03c90 n=1 \u03bdn2 + \u03c902\n\n(183)\n\nWe remind the reader that the denominator of the product stems from the\nfluctuation determinant associated with the Euclidean action\nZ ~\u03b2\n\u0011\n\u0010m\nm\nE\n(184)\nS [q] =\nd\u03c4\nq\u0307 2 + \u03c902 q 2 .\n2\n2\n0\n\nAs we have seen in Sect. 3.3, the coupling to the environment leads to an additional, nonlocal term to the action. Expanding the fluctuations in a Fourier series\nas we did on p. 25 and making use of the Fourier decomposition (178) of the\nintegral kernel k(\u03c4 ), we conclude that an additional term \u03bdn \u03b3\u0302(\u03bdn ) appears in the\nfluctuation determinant. Modifying (183) accordingly, we find for the partition\nfunction of the damped harmonic oscillator\nZ=\n\n\u221e\n\u03bdn2\n1 Y\n.\n2\n~\u03b2\u03c90 n=1 \u03bdn + \u03bdn \u03b3\u0302(\u03bdn ) + \u03c902\n\n(185)\n\nFor strictly Ohmic damping, we have \u03b3\u0302(\u03bdn ) = \u03b3. Since infinite products over\nterms of the form 1 + a/n for large n do not converge, we are forced to introduce\na high-frequency cutoff in order to obtain a finite result. One possibility is the\nDrude cutoff (142) with \u03b3\u0302 given by (179).\nIn the following section we will try to extract some interesting information\nfrom the partition function and in the process will get an idea of where the\ndifficulties for strictly Ohmic damping arise from.\n4.2\n\nGround State Energy and Density of States\n\nA thermodynamic quantity directly related to the partition function is the free\nenergy which can be obtained from the former by means of\nF =\u2212\n\n1\nln(Z) .\n\u03b2\n\n(186)\n\nIn the limit of zero temperature, the free energy becomes the ground state energy\nof the undamped oscillator shifted due to the coupling to the environment. For\nthe free energy, we find with (185)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\n1X\n\u03b3\u0302(\u03bdn ) \u03c902\n1\n(187)\n+ 2 .\nln 1 +\nF = ln(~\u03b2\u03c90 ) +\n\u03b2\n\u03b2 n=1\n\u03bdn\n\u03bdn\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n41\n\nIn the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the spacing between the Matsubara frequencies \u03bdn goes to\nzero and the sum turns into the ground state energy of the damped oscillator\ngiven by the integral\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n~\n\u03b3\u0302(\u03bd) \u03c902\n(188)\n+ 2 .\n\u03b50 =\nd\u03bd ln 1 +\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nIt is particularly interesting to consider the case of weak coupling where\nconnection can be made to results of perturbation theory. This will also help\nto understand the physical meaning of a ground state energy of a dissipative\nsystem derived from a free energy. An expansion of (188) including terms of\norder \u03b3 yields\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n~\n~\n\u03c902\n\u03bd\n\u03b50 =\n\u03b3\u0302(\u03bd) .\n(189)\nd\u03bd ln 1 + 2 +\nd\u03bd 2\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03bd\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03bd + \u03c902\nEvaluation of the first integral yields the expected result ~\u03c90 /2, i.e. the ground\nstate energy of the undamped harmonic oscillator. The second integral represents the shift due to the coupling to the environmental oscillators and can be\nexpressed in terms of the spectral density of bath oscillators J(\u03c9). Recalling\n(177) one can perform the integral over \u03bd and the ground state energy (189) in\nthe presence of damping becomes\nZ \u221e\n~\n1\n~\u03c90\n+\n.\n(190)\nd\u03c9J(\u03c9)\n\u03b50 =\n2\n2\u03c0m 0\n\u03c9(\u03c90 + \u03c9)\nIn order to facilitate the physical interpretation, we rewrite this result as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n~\n1\n1\n~\u03c90\n.\n(191)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nd\u03c9J(\u03c9)\n\u03b50 =\n2\n2\u03c0m\u03c90 0\n\u03c90 + \u03c9 \u03c9\nThe first term of order \u03b3 may be interpreted in analogy to the Lamb shift.\nThere, an atomic level is shifted by creation and subsequent annihilation of a\nvirtual photon as a consequence of the coupling to the electromagnetic vacuum.\nIn our case, the atomic level is replaced by the ground state of the harmonic oscillator and the environmental oscillators are completely equivalent to the modes\nof the electromagnetic field. The pictorial representation of this process is shown\nin Fig. 10. The coupling Hamiltonian (117) allows a transition from the ground\nstate into the first excited state |1i by excitation of the j-th environmental oscillator into its first excited state |1j i.\nThe energy shift associated with the diagram depicted in Fig. 10 is given by\nsecond order perturbation theory as\n\u22060 =\n\nN\nX\n|h1, 1j |cj qxj |0, 0i|2\nj=1\n\n\u2212~\u03c90 \u2212 ~\u03c9j\n\n(192)\n\nwhere the denominator is determined by the energy of the intermediate state\n|1, 1j i.

The ground state energy of the harmonic oscillator is shifted by a transition\nto the first excited state accompanied by a virtual excitation of the j-th environmental\nmode\n\nand the relation (136) for the spectral density of bath oscillators we get\nZ \u221e\n~\n1\n\u22060 = \u2212\nd\u03c9J(\u03c9)\n2\u03c0m\u03c90 0\n\u03c90 + \u03c9\n\n(194)\n\nwhich is just the first term of order \u03b3 in (191). As we know, the bilinear coupling\nHamiltonian appearing in (192) gives rise to a renormalization of the potential\nwhich has been taken care of by the second term in the Hamiltonian (117).\nThe result (194) contains this potential renormalization since only the bilinear\ncoupling term has been considered. In (191), which results from the full Hamiltonian, this effect is subtracted off by the second term under the integral in (191)\nas can be verified by comparison with (145).\nIt is obvious that for strictly Ohmic damping with J(\u03c9) = m\u03b3\u03c9 the correction (194) and with it the ground state energy (191) will display an ultraviolet\ndivergence which is due to the unphysical behaviour of the spectral density J(\u03c9)\nat large frequencies. Assuming a Drude cutoff we find with (141) to leading order\nin the cutoff frequency \u03c9D the finite result\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c9D\n~\u03b3\u03c9D ~\u03b3\n\u22121\n+ O(\u03c9D\n).\n(195)\n+\nln\n\u22060 = \u2212\n4\u03c90\n2\u03c0\n\u03c90\nThe negative first term corresponds to the potential renormalization which is\nno longer present in the ground state energy \u03b50 . The second term, on the other\nhand, is positive and thus leads to an increase of the ground state energy.\nNot only the ground state energy can be derived from the partition function\nbut one may also formally introduce a density of states \u03c1(E) of the damped\nsystem according to [35]\nZ \u221e\nZ(\u03b2) =\ndE\u03c1(E) exp(\u2212\u03b2E) .\n(196)\n0\n\nInversion of the Laplace transformation allows to determine \u03c1(E) from the partition function according to\nZ c+i\u221e\n1\n\u03c1(E) =\nd\u03b2Z(\u03b2) exp(\u03b2E)\n(197)\n2\u03c0i c\u2212i\u221e\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n43\n\nwhere the constant c has to be chosen such that the line of integration is to the\nright of all poles of Z(\u03b2).\nOnce a high-frequency cutoff for the spectral density of bath oscillators is\nspecified, the inverse Laplace transform in (197) may be evaluated either numerically or by contour integration. The second approach leads to a series which\nagain has to be evaluated numerically [35]. However, it is not necessary to introduce a cutoff provided we shift the energy by the ground state energy \u03b50 which\nin fact is the only divergent quantity in this problem. Such a shift may be performed by considering Z exp(\u03b2\u03b50 ) instead of Z itself. To demonstrate that this\nprocedure renders the cutoff irrelevant, we will restrict ourselves to the limit of\nweak damping and large cutoff considered before even though a more general\ntreatment is feasible.\nIn a first step we decompose the infinite product appearing in the partition\nfunction (185) with Drude cutoff (179) into a factor where the limit \u03c9D \u2192 \u221e\ncan safely be taken and a factor still containing the cutoff frequency\nZ=\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nY\n\u03bdn2 + \u03b3\u03bdn\n1 Y\n~\u03b2\u03c90 n=1 \u03bdn2 + \u03b3\u03bdn + \u03c902 n=1 1 +\n\n1\n.\n\u03b3\u03c9D\n\u03bdn (\u03bdn + \u03c9D )\n\n(198)\n\nIt is the last product which has to be analyzed with care because it vanishes in\nthe limit \u03c9D \u2192 \u221e.

With the leading asymptotic behaviour\n\u03c8(1 + z) \u223c ln(z) for large arguments z, the partition function for large cutoff\nfrequency becomes\n\u0013\u2212~\u03b2\u03b3/2\u03c0\n\u0012\n\u221e\n\u03bdn2 + \u03b3\u03bdn\n~\u03b2\u03c9D\n1 Y\n.\nZ=\n~\u03b2\u03c90 n=1 \u03bdn2 + \u03b3\u03bdn + \u03c902\n2\u03c0\n\n(201)\n\nOn the other hand, we know from our result (195) that the ground state energy\ndiverges to leading order with (~\u03b3/2\u03c0) ln(\u03c9D ). Therefore, multiplication of the\npartition function with exp(\u03b2\u03b50 ) leads indeed to an expression with a finite value\nin the limit of infinite cutoff frequency.\nBefore taking a look at numerical results, we remark that the partition function contains a pole at \u03b2 = 0 with residue 1/~\u03c90 . This pole represents the Laplace\n\n\f44\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nh\u0304\u03c90 \u03c1\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\n(E \u2212 \u03b50 )/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n20\n\nFig. 11. The density of states (197) of the damped harmonic oscillator is shown for\n\u03b3/2\u03c90 = 0.05. A delta function contribution at E = \u03b50 has been omitted. The dashed\nline marks the average density of states 1/~\u03c90\n\ntransform of the constant 1/~\u03c90 and therefore is related to the average density\nof states which takes the value of the undamped case where the energy spacing\nbetween adjacent levels is ~\u03c90 . In Fig. 11 we present the density of states for\nweak damping, \u03b3/2\u03c90 = 0.05. A delta function contribution at E = \u03b50 has been\nomitted. Due to the weak damping we find well defined peaks which are close\nto the energies expected for an undamped oscillator. With increasing energy\nthe levels become broader. For stronger damping, only the lowest levels can be\nresolved and a level shift induced by the damping becomes visible.\nThe behaviour of the level widths shown in Fig. 11 is consistent with the\nresult of a perturbative treatment. According to Fermi's golden rule, the width\nof the n-th level is given by\n\u0393n =\n\n\u221e\n2\u03c0 X h\n2\nhn + 1, 1j |cj qxj |n, 0i \u03b4(\u2212\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9j )\n2\n~ j=1\n\n(202)\n\ni\n+ hn \u2212 1, 1j |cj qxj |n, 0i \u03b4(\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9j )\n2\n\nwhere we have already taken into account that the matrix element of the dipoletype coupling only connects the state n to its nearest neighbours. Because of\nenergy conservation the first part of the sum never contributes.

We remark that one can demonstrate by a semiclassical analysis\nof other one-dimensional potentials that it is indeed the level number and not\nthe energy which is decisive for the level width [37].\n4.3\n\nPosition Autocorrelation Function\n\nIn the introduction we have mentioned fluctuations as one of the effects arising\nfrom the coupling to an environment. Even if a system is in thermal equilibrium\nwith its environment, fluctuations due to the noise term (128) will be present.\nThe appropriate quantity to describe this phenomenon are equilibrium correlation functions like the position autocorrelation function\nC(t) = hq(t)q(0)i = Tr(q(t)q(0)\u03c1\u03b2 ) .\n\n(206)\n\nFrom this quantity one can derive all other equilibrium correlation functions of\nthe damped harmonic oscillator as is discussed in [38].\nWe now want to determine this correlation function by first calculating its\nimaginary time version and start with the Euclidean action\nZ\nZ ~\u03b2\nZ ~\u03b2 \u0010\nm 2 m 2 2 \u0011 1 ~\u03b2\nq\u0307 + \u03c90 q +\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c3k(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)q(\u03c4 )q(\u03c3)\nS E [q] =\nd\u03c4\n2\n2\n2 0\n0\n0\n(207)\nZ ~\u03b2\n+\n\nd\u03c4 F (\u03c4 )q(\u03c4 ) .\n\n0\n\nThe second term accounts for the coupling to the environment as we have shown\nin Sect. 3.3. In addition, we have included the third term corresponding to an\nexternal force in imaginary time. This constitutes a useful trick which will allow\nus to determine the correlation function by variation with respect to this force\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n2\n\u03c1\nhq(\u03c4 )q(\u03c3)i = ~ Tr\n.\n(208)\n\u03b4F (\u03c4 ) \u03b4F (\u03c3)\nF =0\nAs we know already from Sect. 2.7, the force does not appear in the fluctuation part.

For negative times t,\nthe sum in (216) would not converge. We therefore have to perform an analytic\ncontinuation to real times in a more elaborate way.\nThe idea is to express the sum (216) as a contour integral in the complex\nfrequency plane. To this end, we need a function with poles at frequencies \u03c9 =\ni\u03bdn , n = \u2212\u221e, . . . , \u221e with a residuum of one. This requirement is satisfied by\n~\u03b2/[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212~\u03b2\u03c9)].

According to the Ehrenfest theorem the equation of motion for the\nexpectation value of the position agrees with the corresponding classical equation\nof motion. In the presence of an external force F (t), the latter reads\nmq\u0308 + m\u03b3 q\u0307 + m\u03c902 q = F (t) .\n\n(222)\n\n\f48\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nThe solution of this equation may be expressed in terms of the response function\n\u03c7(t) as\nZ t\nq(t) =\nds\u03c7(t \u2212 s)F (s)\n(223)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich by means of a Fourier transformation becomes\nq\u0303(\u03c9) = \u03c7\u0303(\u03c9)F\u0303 (\u03c9) .\n\n(224)\n\nWith the equation of motion (222) the dynamic susceptibility of the damped\nharmonic oscillator is then found to read\n1\n1\n.\nm \u2212\u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c9 + \u03c902\n\n\u03c7(\u03c9) =\n\n(225)\n\nTogether with (220) and (221) one finally obtains the relation\nC\u0303(\u03c9) =\n\n2~\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212~\u03b2\u03c9)\n\n(226)\n\nwhich represents an example of the so-called fluctuation-dissipation theorem\n[39]. Here, the position autocorrelation function describes the fluctuations while\nthe imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility \u03c7\u2032\u2032 can be shown to determine\nthe energy dissipated under the influence of the external driving F (t). While\nthe relation (226) is exact for linear systems like the damped harmonic oscillator considered here, it still holds for nonlinear systems within linear response\ntheory. There, the response to the external force is considered in leading order\nperturbation theory [40,41].\nIt is instructive to consider the real time correlation function (220) in more\ndetail. We first decompose the correlation function C(t) into its real and imaginary part, or equivalently, into its symmetric and antisymmetric part\nC(t) = S(t) + iA(t) ,\nwith\n\n\u0001\n1\nhq(t)q(0)i + hq(0)q(t)i\n2\n\nS(t) =\nand\n\nA(t) = \u2212\nFrom (220) we find\n~\nS(t) =\n2\u03c0m\n\n\u0001\ni\nhq(t)q(0)i \u2212 hq(0)q(t)i .\n2\n\n(228)\n\n(229)\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~\u03b2\u03c9\n\u03b3\u03c9\ncos(\u03c9t)\ncoth\nd\u03c9 2\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c902 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\n2\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n(227)\n\nand\nA(t) = \u2212\n\n~\n2\u03c0m\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\n\n\u03b3\u03c9\nsin(\u03c9t) .\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c902 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\n\n(230)\n\n(231)\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n49\n\nApart from Planck's constant appearing in the prefactor, the antisymmetric part\nis purely classical.

One set of four poles at frequencies\n\u0010\n\u03b3\u0011\n\u03c9 = \u00b1 \u03c9\u0304 \u00b1 i\n(233)\n2\ncorresponds to the characteristic frequencies of a damped harmonic oscillator\nwith the oscillation frequency\n\u03c9\u0304 =\n\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u03b32\n\u03c902 \u2212\n4\n\n(234)\n\nshifted by the damping. In addition, there exists an infinite number of poles at\nimaginary frequencies i\u03bdn , n = \u2212\u221e, . . . , \u221e depending on the temperature of the\nheat bath via the Matsubara frequencies defined in (107). With these poles, one\ncan evaluate the integral (230) by means of a contour integration to obtain\nS(t) =\n\n~\n[sinh(~\u03b2 \u03c9\u0304) cos(\u03c9\u0304t) + sin(~\u03b2\u03b3/2) sin(\u03c9\u0304|t|)]\nexp(\u2212\u03b3|t|/2)\n2m\u03c9\u0304\ncosh(~\u03b2 \u03c9\u0304) \u2212 cos(~\u03b2\u03b3/2)\n\u221e\nX\n\u03bdn exp(\u2212\u03bdn |t|)\n2\u03b3\n.\n\u2212\nm\u03b2 n=1 (\u03bdn2 + \u03c902 )2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u03bdn2\n\n(235)\n\nThe sum in the second line becomes important at low temperatures kB T \u226a\n~\u03b3/4\u03c0. In order to discuss this quantum effect, we focus in the following discussion on the case of zero temperature. Then, the poles of the hyperbolic cotangent\nin (230) become dense and form a cut on the imaginary axis which has consequences for the long-time behaviour of the correlation function. In the limit\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the sum in the second line of (235) turns into an integral. Noting that\nthe long-time behaviour is determined by the behaviour of the integrand at small\narguments we find\nZ \u221e\n~\u03b3\n~\u03b3 1\nx exp(\u2212x|t|)\nS(t) \u223c \u2212\n=\u2212\n.\n(236)\ndx\n\u03c0m 0\n\u03c904\n\u03c0m\u03c904 t2\nInstead of the usual exponential decay we thus find an algebraic decay.\nIn the limit of vanishing damping, the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility appearing in the integrand of (230) turns into a sum of two delta functions\n\n\f50\n\nGert-Ludwig Ingold\n\nlocated at \u03c90 and \u2212\u03c90 .

Within the so-called Markov approximation, one then replaces the contributions to the integrand which depend\nonly weakly on frequency by their values at \u03c9\u0304. As we will see, in contrast to\n(236) the correlation function S(t) at zero temperature then no longer decays\nalgebraically. It is interesting to discuss the reason for this discrepancy.\nTo this end we go back to the integral representation (230) of the correlation\nfunction S(t). In a first step, we apply the so-called rotating wave approximation\n(RWA) which consists in neglecting the Lorentzian located at \u2212\u03c9\u0304, i.e. the second\nterm in (237) [42]. Physically speaking, we neglect processes where the system\nis excited into an energetically higher state by loosing energy to the driving\nforce or where the system decays to a lower state by absorbing energy. For finite\ntemperatures, we now have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n~\u03b2\u03c9\n~\n\u03b3\ncoth\nSRWA (t) =\nd\u03c9\ncos(\u03c9t) .\n(238)\n8\u03c0m\u03c9\u0304 \u2212\u221e\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304)2 + \u03b3 2 /4\n2\nWithin the Markov approximation, we replace the hyperbolic cotangent by its\nvalue at \u03c9 = \u03c9\u0304. In the limit of zero temperature this leads to\nZ \u221e\n~\n\u03b3\nSRWA,Markov (t) =\ncos(\u03c9t)\nd\u03c9\n8\u03c0m\u03c9\u0304 \u2212\u221e\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304)2 + \u03b3 2 /4\n(239)\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011\n~\ncos(\u03c9\u0304t) exp \u2212 t .\n=\n4m\u03c9\u0304\n2\nWe thus find an oscillation with a frequency shifted due to the environmental\ncoupling and an exponential decay in contrast to the algebraic decay (236).\nThis difference can be understood by taking a closer look at the Markov approximation. In Fig. 13 the Lorentzian and the hyperbolic cotangent appearing\nin (238) are schematically shown as full and dashed line, respectively. In order\nto obtain (239), we have approximated the hyperbolic cotangent by a constant.\nHowever, in doing this, we have replaced an antisymmetric function by a symmetric one which can only yield a non-vanishing result together with the rotating\nwave approximation made above. As a consequence, the area shaded in grey has\nbeen taken with the wrong sign. The idea was that this difference should be\nsmall and arising from frequencies far from \u03c9\u0304. However, due to the large extent\nof a Lorentzian, it is of order \u03b3 and, in addition, it replaces an exponential decay\nby an algebraic decay.\nAt zero temperature the difference between (238) and (239) becomes\n\u2206 = SRWA (t) \u2212 SRWA,Markov (t)\nZ 0\n~\n\u03b3\n= \u22122\ncos(\u03c9t)\nd\u03c9\n8\u03c0m \u2212\u221e\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u0304)2 + \u03b3 2 /4\n\n(240)\n\n\fPath Integrals and Quantum Dissipation\n\n51\n\n\u03c9\n\nFig. 13. The full and dashed lines represent the Lorentzian and hyperbolic cotangent,\nrespectively, which contribute to the integrand in (238)\n\nwhich may be expressed in terms of integral sine and integral cosine functions.\nFor our purpose it is sufficient to note that for long times, the difference indeed\ndecays algebraically as\n~\u03b3 1\n\u2206=\u2212\n.\n(241)\n2\u03c0m\u03c9\u030404 t2\nWe remark that the factor of two relative to the result (236) arises because no\nrotating wave approximation has been made in deriving the latter.\nIn the previous discussion, we have been concerned with an effect of order\n\u03b3 which in the spirit of the Markov approximation should be considered as\nsmall. However, the Markov approximation changes the long-time behaviour of\nthe equilibrium correlation function S(t) qualitatively and the absence of an\nalgebraic decay, even with a small prefactor, may be relevant. For truly weak\ncoupling, the damping constant \u03b3 should be the smallest frequency scale. Apart\nfrom the usual weak coupling condition \u03b3 \u226a \u03c90 we also have to require \u03b3 \u226a\nkB T /~ which at low temperatures may become difficult to satisfy.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThis chapter is based on courses taught at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Physik\nkomplexer Systeme in Dresden and at the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur Strasbourg.\nThe author is grateful to the organizers of the school on \"Coherent evolution\nin noisy environments\", in particular Andreas Buchleitner (Dresden), as well\nas Rodolfo Jalabert (ULP Strasbourg) for having provided the opportunity to\nlecture on path integrals and quantum dissipation.
