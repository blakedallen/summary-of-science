In Rd , denote by + the Minkowski\naddition of sets. The operators vol, diam, cl, int, \u2202 resp. stand for the volume,\ndiameter, closure, interior and P\nboundary of a Borel set. Let kzk be the euclidean\nnorm of a vector, and kzk1 = i |zi | its L1 norm, where the zi are the coordinates of z in the canonical basis e = (e1 , . . . , ed ). Denote by \u03bbd the Lebesgue\nmeasure in Rd , and \u03b3d the standard normal distribution. The cardinality of a\nfinite set E is denoted by |E|. Given two random vector-valued variables X, Y ,\nlet cov(X, Y) be their covariance matrix in a predefinite basis u, i.e.\ncov(X, Y )i,j = EXi Yj \u2212 EXi EYj ,\nwhere the Xi and Yj are the components of X and Y in u. The covariance matrix\nof a vector is simply denoted cov(X, X) = cov(X). The weak convergence of\nmeasures is denoted by \u21d2.\n\u2217 raphael.lachieze-rey@math.univ-lille1.fr\n\u2020 youri.davydov@math.univ-lille1.fr\n\n1\n\n\fPreliminary example Consider a finite population, arbitrarily labelled with\nnumbers k in {1, . . . , N }, for N \u2208 N\u2217 . For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N , the member k receives\nan income of a certain resource, denoted by a real number g(k). Now let \u03c3 be a\npermutation of {1, . . . , N } that makes the function k \u2192 g(\u03c3(k)) non-decreasing.\nCall g\u0303 = g \u25e6 \u03c3 the P\nmonotone rearrangement of g.\nk\nDefine \u03c8(k) = i=1 g\u0303(i), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Since g\u0303 is monotone, \u03c8 is convex. For\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 N , \u03c8(k) represents the total amount of resources detained by the nk -th\npoorest fraction of the population. Now, call \u03c8(k) = nk \u03c8(n). It is the \"equality\nfunction\", in the sense that \u03c8 = \u03c8 iff all incomes are equal. Also, for some\ndistance \u03b4, the distance \u03b4(\u03c8, \u03c8) between \u03c8 and its equality function measures\nthe inequalities among thePpopulation.\nk\nIf one defines f (k) = i=1 g(i), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N , the cumulative income, \u03c8 is\ncalled the convex rearrangement of f . It is indeed the only convex function\nwhich has the same increments (but in a different order), and coincides with f\nat N . Consider for instance the case where \u03b4 is the L1 norm on RN , normalized\nby N . For a given cumulative income function f , the quantity\nN \u22121 k\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8k1 =\n\nN\n1 X\nk\n\u03c8(k) \u2212 f (n)\nN\nn\nk=1\n\nretrieves the Gini coefficient, which has played a central role in measuring economic inequality since its introduction by Corrado Gini at the beginning of the\n20th century. The use of the convex rearrangement for measuring economic\ninequality is discussed in [11].\nThe notion of rearrangement, defined above for a discrete population, can\nbe generalized in the continuous framework. If g1 is an integrable function on\n[0, 1], and \u03c3 is a transformation of [0, 1] which preserves Lebesgue measure, the\nfunction defined by\ng2 = g1 \u25e6 \u03c3\n\n(1)\n\nis a rearrangement of g. For any function g, denote by \u03bcg the image of Lebesgue\nmeasure under g. Relation (1) also implies\n\u03bcg2 = \u03bcg1 .\n\n(2)\n\nA function g2 is said to be a rearrangement of g1 if it satisfies (2). Remark that in\ngeneral this is not equivalent to (1). A monotone rearrangement of an integrable\nfunction g on [0, 1] is a non-decreasing function that is a rearrangement of g, and\nis denoted by Mg. It is easy to see that every integrable function on [0, 1] admits\na monotone rearrangement, unique up to a negligible set ( see for instance [8]).\nLike in the preliminary example, a convex rearrangement of a differentiable\nfunction f is a convex function \u03c8 which derivative is obtained as the rearrangement of the derivative of f , i.e. \u03bc\u03c80 = \u03bcf 0 . If furthermore \u03c8 and f coincide\nin a predetermined point z0 , then \u03c8 is the convex rearrangement of f , and is\ndenoted by \u03c8 = Cf .\n2\n\n\fIf a function f is irregular, one can take regularizations fn , n \u2265 1, and study\nasymptotically their rearrangements b\u22121\nn Cfn , under the proper renormalization\nbn > 0. Also, the asymptotic rearrangement is consistent, i.e. if \u03bcgn has a weak\nlimit \u03bc, for a sequence of functions {gn ; n \u2208 N}, then the monotone rearrangements of the gn also converge, to a function g satisfying \u03bcg = \u03bc. The result\nis similar for convex rearrangements, i.e. the convergence of the \u03bcfn0 yields the\nconvergence of the Cfn0 . It is of practical and theoretical interest to investigate\nasymptotic properties of rearrangements. It can be used, for example, to construct estimators of parameters of stochastic processes, and for measuring their\nfluctuations, see [7]. There are also connections between convex rearrangement\nand other areas of research such as Finance Mathematics and Economics. The\nLorenz curve, important in finance mathematics, is a common object in convex rearrangement of Gaussian processes. In the field of econometrics, convex\nrearrangement can be used to measure the indices of fluctuations of stochastic\nprocesses, related to indices of economic inequality, like the Gini index in the\npreliminary example, see [11]. The monotone rearrangement of a function g\nalso has a physical meaning, as the solution of the optimal transport problem\nwith transfer plan g. the asymptotic convex rearrangement has been studied\nfor many one-dimensional processes, see [7] for a survey.\nWe propose the following generalization to a compact K of Rd . For a function\ng integrable on K, call \u03bcg the image of Lebesgue measure \u03bbd under g. Then a\nfunction g2 is a rearrangement of an other function g1 if and only if it satisfies\n(2). The rearrangement is furthermore said to be monotone if g2 is a monotone\nfunction, i.e the gradient of a convex function. Correspondingly, a function \u03c8 is\na convex rearrangement of a real function f if it is convex and yields the same\ngradient distribution than f .\nIn Section 1, a reduced version of the problem of optimal transport is introduced. Brenier's theorem, originally designed for this optimal transport\nproblem, is given, and this allows us to rigorously define monotone and convex rearrangements in higher dimensions. We also prove that, like in the onedimensional case, the convergence of the convex rearrangements of a family of\nfunctions fn is equivalent to the weak convergence of the measures \u03bc\u2207fn . This\nresult, which serves later for rearranging Gaussian fields, is called the consistency theorem.\nIn section 2, we introduce the probabilistic framework of this paper. It\nconsists of a random field X approximated by polygonal fields Xn , n \u2265 1, interpolating X on a simplicial grid. We give in the Gaussian framework the almost\n\u22121\nsure weak convergence of the sequence of measures \u03bcbn \u2207Xn = \u03bbd (b\u22121\nn \u2207Xn )\nto a measure \u03bc for proper bn > 0, under weak assumptions on the covariance\nfunction of the field X. This yields according to the consistency theorem the\nconvergence of b\u22121\nn CXn . The almost sure convergence towards \u03bc ensures that\nquantities of interest can be computed from each sample path Xn . Thus this\ndeterministic limit object, new in the literature, can serve for estimating several\nquantities related to the regularity and the isotropy of X, or more generally to\nits covariance function, with only one realization.\n3\n\n\fWe show in Section 3 that this result applies to the Fractional Brownian\nfield and to the Brownian sheet, and compute the limit measure \u03bc. At the\ncontrary of the one-dimensional case, we observe through these examples that \u03bc\ndepends on the method of approximation, and in particular on the orientation\nof the simplices used in the triangulation. We represented on Figure 1 the\nasymptotic convex rearrangement of the Brownian sheet on [0, 1]2 , approximated\nby polygonal fields on a natural triangulation of the plane.\n\nFigure 1: Asymptotic convex rearrangement of the Brownian sheet.\n\n1\n\nMonotone rearrangements and optimal transport\n\nThis section exposes the theoretical material required for rearranging multivariate functions with compact support. It is related to the optimal transport\nproblem, in that the monotone rearrangement MS of a transport plan S coincides with the optimal solution to the corresponding transport problem. Then,\nwe study the consistency of the monotone rearrangement, needed for rearranging irregular functions, the same way it is done for Brownian motion just below.\n\n4\n\n\f1.1\n\nOne dimensional case. Convex rearrangement of the\nBrownian motion\n\nAs has been said in the introduction, the monotone rearrangement of a function\ng is the monotone function that yields the same distribution. We emphasize\nhere that the central object of the monotone rearrangement is \u03bcg , the image\nof Lebesgue measure under g. In other words, two functions have the same\nrearrangement if they have the same distribution.\nIf now f is an absolutely continuous\nfunction on [0, 1], i.e such that for almost\nRx\nall x in [0, 1], f (x) \u2212 f (0) = 0 g(t)dt for some integrable function g, the convex\nrearrangement of f is the unique convex function \u03c8 verifying \u03c8(0) = f (0) and\n\u03c8 0 = Mf 0 a.e.. Write \u03c8 = Cf , where C is the convex rearrangement operator.\nFor f irregular, one chooses smooth approximations {fn ; n \u2265 1}, and\nstudies asymptotically the rearrangements. If there exists a sequence {bn ; n \u2265 1}\nand a convex function \u03c8 such that b1n Cfn \u2192 \u03c8 a.e., \u03c8 is said to be an asymptotic\nconvex rearrangement of f with renormalizing sequence {bn ; n \u2265 1}.\nAlthough a rigourous study is not trivial, it is possible to understand better\nthe convex rearrangement machinery in the case of the Wiener process. Take X\na standard\nBrownian motion on [0, \u221a\n1], with Xn its piece-wise linear interpolation\n\b\non nk ; 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n , normalized by n to avoid the divergence of the increments.\nFor each n, Xn is differentiable a.e., and the image of Lebesgue measure \u03bb1 under\nthe renormalized derivative is written\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n1 0\n\u03bcn = \u03bb1 \u221a Xn\n.\nn\nThe independence of increments implies that \u03bcn is the empirical distribution of\nn independent normal variables, and it is clear that it converges weakly to the\nnormal distribution \u03b31 . It is rigorously proven later, in Theorem 1.2, why this\nimplies that the asymptotic convex rearrangement of X on ]0, 1[ is the Lorenz\ncurve GL1 , defined as the unique convex function with gradient distribution\n\u03b31 . Davydov and Vershik [6] obtained the strongest result, namely the uniform\nconvergence of k \u221a1n CXn \u2212 GL1 k\u221e to 0 with probability 1.\nA lot of similar results are obtained with processes that have stationary increments, or are stable, see the survey [7]. Azais and Wschebor [1] also showed\nthat, for X in a certain class of Gaussian processes, if instead of a piece-wise\nlinear approximation, one chooses for Xn a regularization of X by a convolution\nkernel, then X admits the same asymptotic convex rearrangement, namely the\ngeneralized Lorenz curve GL1 . In this case, the asymptotic convex rearrangement of f seems unambiguous, up to the multiplication by a non-zero constant,\nin the sense that it does not depend on the approximation method. We will see\nin Section 3 that it is not the case for anisotropic multivariate random fields.\n\n5\n\n\f1.2\n\nThe optimal transport problem and rearrangement\noperators\n\nThe problem described below is a simplified version of the traditional optimal\ntransport problem, which is fully described and exhaustively discussed in [10].\nA company has a capacity of production per unit time represented by a\nmeasure \u03bc on Rd , the production measure. The quantity produced in area dx\nper unit time is \u03bc(dx). This company has to deliver its production to a domain\nK of Rd , compact and convex, where the demand is uniformly distributed. The\ncost of transport between a site of production s and a point z in K is denoted\nby c(s, z), where the cost function c is supposed to be measurable and nonnegative. A transport plan S is a function which associates to each z in K\nthe corresponding production site S(z), where the product delivered to z comes\nfrom. Let \u03bcS be the image of Lebesgue measure under S. We need to have, for\nall Borel set B \u2208 Bd ,\n\u03bcS (B) = \u03bc(B),\n\n(3)\n\nso that the quantity produced at each production site corresponds to the quantity of product conveyed to the distribution area. The total cost of this transport\nplan is hence\nZ\nC(S) =\nc(z, S(z))dz.\nz\u2208K\n\nAssume that the cost is quadratic, i.e. c(z, s) = kz \u2212 \u03b6k2 . The optimal transport problem consists in finding a transport plan S : K \u2192 Rd minimizing the\ncost C(S) under requirement (3). Addressing this issue, suppose that a given\ntransport plan S is modified by switching the destinations z and \u03b6 for two productions sites S(z) and S(\u03b6) for an infinitesimal quantity of product. The new\ntransport plan is denoted S\u0303 and the corresponding cost variation is\nC(S\u0303) \u2212 C(S) = 2hz \u2212 \u03b6, S(z) \u2212 S(\u03b6)i(dz + d\u03b6).\nInformally, a transport plan will be in some sense locally optimal if, for all\nz, \u03b6 \u2208 K,\nhz \u2212 \u03b6, S(z) \u2212 S(\u03b6)i \u2265 0.\n\n(4)\n\nIt turns out that (4) and (3) indeed characterize optimal transport plans (see\n[10]).\nThe question that naturally arises now is about the existence of such an\noptimal transport plan. That is the purpose of the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1 (Brenier).\nCall K(K) the class of convex functions on K. Let G(K) be the set of monotone\nfunctions on K, defined by\n\u001a\nG(K) =\n\nZ\n\u2207\u03c8; \u03c8 \u2208 K(K),\nK\n\n6\n\n\u001b\nk\u2207\u03c8k < \u221e .\n\n\fThen, if \u03bc is a measure on Rd with finite first moment, there is a unique monotone function in G(K), denoted by M\u03bc , such that \u03bbd M\u22121\n\u03bc = \u03bc.\nComments, proof, and a more general result can be found in [3]. If a point z0\nof K is unambiguously defined as \"starting point\", call C\u03bc the convex function\nwhich gradient is M\u03bc , satisfying C\u03bc (z0 ) = 0. The function M\u03bc is the optimal\nsolution of the transport problem with production measure \u03bc.\nTheorem 1.1 is the proper tool to define high dimensional monotone and\nconvex rearrangements.\nDefinition 1.1. For an integrable function g on K, define Mg = M\u03bcg its\nmonotone rearrangement.\nLet S(K) be the class of functions which are differentiable in a.e. point of\nK and satisfy\nZ\nk\u2207f (z)kdz < +\u221e.\nK\n\nFor a function f in S(K), there exists a unique convex function, denoted by Cf ,\nwhich satisfies\n\u03bbd (\u2207Cf )\u22121\nCf (z0 )\n\n= \u03bbd (\u2207f )\u22121 ,\n= f (z0 ).\n\nIt is called convex rearrangement of f .\nThe convex rearrangement can also be defined as Cf = C\u03bc\u2207f + f (z0 ). Given\na vector-valued function S on K, since MS is the gradient of a convex function, its restriction to each segment [z, \u03b6] \u2282 K is non-decreasing, whence it\nsatisfies (4). In this regard, Theorem 1.1 provides with MS a unique solution\nto the optimal transport problem with transport plan S. Note that [3] also\ngives the existence of a measure-preserving transformation \u03c3 of [0, 1] such that\nMS \u25e6 \u03c3 = S, provided \u03bcS is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue\nmeasure, which justifies the \"rearrangement\" terminology.\nIn dimension 1, convex rearrangement was already defined in the literature.\nThe class S(K) is exactly that of absolutely continuous functions if K is a\ncompact interval of R. Hence, it is a generalization of absolutely continuous\nfunctions upon which we extend operator C. Note that, although it is called\n\"convex rearrangement\", function Cf is not a rearrangement of f in the sense\nof (2). For instance, f and Cf do not in general yield the same maximum.\nNevertheless, visually it corresponds in some way to piling up the increments of\nf in another order.\n\n1.3\n\nConsistency of the rearrangement operators\n\nIn this article we deal with irregular random fields, for which we cannot a priori\nobtain a convex rearrangement due to the absence of gradient. In consequence,\n7\n\n\fby analogy with the 1-dimensional case, we instead investigate asymptotically\nthe convex rearrangement of their regularizations. Call asymptotic convex rearrangement of f any convex function that is the limit of renormalized convex\nrearrangements of regularizations of g. Theorem 1.2 allows us to obtain an\nasymptotic convex rearrangement of a function by studying asymptotically the\ngradients distributions.\nIn the sequel, K is a convex body of Rd , with an arbitrary starting point\nz0 \u2208 K. The following theorem will be our main tool for rearranging random\nfields. For a compact set L and a real-valued function f on L,\nkf kL\n\u221e = sup |f (x)|,\nx\u2208L\n\nand for a vector-valued function g on L,\nZ\nL\nkgkL1 =\nkg(z)k1 dz.\nL\n\nTheorem 1.2.\nTake {fn ; n \u2265 1} and f in S(K), and define gn = \u2207fn , g = \u2207f . Then the\nthree following statements are equivalent:\n\u03bcgn\nk(Cfn \u2212 fn (z0 )) \u2212\n\nkMgn \u2212 MgkL\nL1\n(Cf \u2212 f (z0 ))kL\n\u221e\n\n\u21d2 \u03bcg ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2192 0, for all compact L of int(K), (6)\n\u2192 0, for all compact L of int(K). (7)\n\nThe proof is at Section 5.1. The following lemma gives conditions for the\nweak convergence of the random measures \u03bcn to a measure \u03bc.\nFollowing [2], call convergence-determining class C a class of Borel sets such\nthat the weak convergence of measures follows from the pointwise convergence\non C. Theorem 2.2 p.15 in [2] implies that there is a countable such class in Rd .\nLemma 1.1. Let {\u03bcn ; n \u2265 1} be a sequence of random probability measures\nwith characteristic functions {\u03c6n n \u2265 1}. Let \u03bc be a probability measure on Rd\nwith characteristic function \u03c6, assume that one of following holds\n(i) for almost all h of Rd , \u03c6n (h) \u2192 \u03c6(h) a.s.,\n(ii) for every \u03bc-continuity Borel set B from a countable convergence-determining\nclass, \u03bcn (B) \u2192 \u03bc(B) a.s.,\nthen \u03bcn \u21d2 \u03bc with probability one.\nProof. (i): We have\nZ Z\nRd\n\n(1 \u2212 1{\u03c6n (h,\u03c9)\u2192\u03c6(h,\u03c9)} )P(d\u03c9)dh = 0.\n\u03a9\n\nDue to Fubini's theorem, with probability one, for almost all h of Rd ,\n\u03c6n (h) \u2192 \u03c6(h),\n8\n\n\fand it is well known that it implies the weak convergence of the corresponding\nprobability measures.\n(ii): Since the class is countable, the pointwise convergences \u03bcn (B) \u2192 \u03bc(B)\nhold simultaneously with probability 1, and since the class is convergencedetermining, it yields the a.s. convergence \u03bcn \u21d2 \u03bc.\n\n2\n\nAsymptotic rearrangement of random fields\n\nIn this section, we consider a random field X defined on Kd = [0, 1]d and give\ngeneral results about its asymptotic rearrangement. Then we give the main theorem of convergence in the case of Gaussian fields, in the framework of polygonal\napproximation. This generalizes the asymptotic convex rearrangement of the\nBrownian motion derived in Section 1.1.\n\n2.1\n\nGeneral results\n\nThe notation {Yn ; n \u2265 1} stands here for a sequence of smooth vector valued\nrandom fields, and {\u03bcn = \u03bcYn ; n \u2265 1} are their distributions. In this section a general result concerning the asymptotics of {\u03bcn ; n \u2265 1} is given. The\nobjective is to obtain a deterministic limit measure \u03bc of the \u03bcn , and use the\nconsistency Theorem 1.2. The primary condition for the convergence of \u03bcn is\nthe convergence of the expectation\n\u0012Z\n\u0013 Z\nE(\u03bcn (B)) = E\n1Yn (z)\u2208B dz =\nP(Yn (z) \u2208 B)dz \u2192 \u03bc(B)\n(8)\nKd\n\nKd\n\nfor some measure \u03bc and every \u03bc-continuity Borel set B. As a first example,\nthe following proposition gives a sufficient condition on the conjoint laws of the\nvariables (Yn (z))z\u2208Kd for the convergence of \u03bcn .\nTheorem 2.1. Assume that for all \u03bc-continuity Borel sets B in a convergencedetermining class of Bd (see. [2], p.15),\nZ\nX\n\u0001\ncov 1{Yn (z)\u2208B} , 1{Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B} dzd\u03b6 < \u221e,\n(9)\n(Kd )2 n\u22651\n\nthen \u03bcn \u21d2 \u03bc a.s.\nProof. For B a \u03bc-continuity Borel set in the convergence determining class,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\nE |\u03bcn (B) \u2212 E(\u03bcn (B))|2 = E \u03bcn (B)2 \u2212 (E\u03bcn (B))\n\u0012Z\n\u0013 Z\nZ\nZ\n= E\ndz1Yn (z)\u2208B\nd\u03b61Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B \u2212\ndzP (Yn (z) \u2208 B)\nd\u03b6P (Yn (\u03b6) \u2208 B)\nKd\nKd\nKd\nKd\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\n=\ndzd\u03b6 E 1Yn (z)\u2208B 1Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B \u2212 E(1Yn (z)\u2208B )E 1Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B\nKd2\n\nZ\n=\nKd2\n\n\u0001\ndzd\u03b6cov 1Yn (z)\u2208B , 1Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B .\n\n9\n\n\fHence, hypothesis (9), along with Borel-Cantelli's lemma, ensures that with\nprobability one, \u03bcn (B) \u2192 \u03bc(B). Lemma 1.1-(ii) yields the conclusion.\nFor most of the random\nfields investigated in Section 3, the covariance\n\u0001\ncov 1Yn (z)\u2208B , 1Yn (\u03b6)\u2208B is in O( n1 ) and we cannot have asymptotic rearrange1\nis summable. We need\nment for MYn , but only for a subsequence such that \u03c3(n)\nstronger results in this case, and were able to obtain them in the framework of\nGaussian fields, interpolated on a simplicial triangulation.\n\n2.2\n\nSimplicial approximations on Kd\n\nMost of the commonly investigated random fields of the literature are irregular,\nand hence cannot be directly rearranged, they need to be approximated by\nsmooth functions. In this article, we only adopted the following paradigm:\nGiven a random real field X, define approximations Xn of X, then normalize\nand rearrange monotonically their gradient, which will be called Yn = b1n \u2207Xn\nfor some bn > 0.\nIn this paradigm, one would like the result not to depend on the choice of\nthe approximation Xn , as long as it converges to X. Unfortunately, it is in\nthe very nature of the convex rearrangement to be sensitive to slight changes\nin the approximation method. Consider for instance the following deterministic\nexample. Define fn as the continuous function on [0, 1] null in 0, linear on each\nsegment [ nk , k+1\nn ] for 1 \u2264 k < n, and with slope \u00b11. Then, fn uniformly converges to the (convex) null function, but Cfn uniformly converges to the convex\npiece-wise linear function null in 0 having slope \u22121 on [0, 21 ] and +1 on [ 12 , 1].\nTo avoid this kind of phenomenon for asymptotic convex rearrangement, one\nneeds to ensure that the gradient of the approximation resembles the gradient\nof the original function, or its increments if there is no gradient. That is one\nof the reasons why we choose for Xn the polygonal interpolations of X on the\nvertices of a triangulation. We present below the details of the construction.\nCall simplex of Rd the convex hull of any (d + 1)-tuple of points with nonempty interior. Write\n(\n)\nd\nX\nSd = (ti )1\u2264i\u2264d : 0 \u2264 ti \u2264 1,\nti \u2264 1\ni=1\n\nthe elementary simplex of Rd . Given z in Rd and an orthonormal basis u =\n(ui )1\u2264i\u2264d of Rd , define the simplex with summit z, and basis u as\n\u03a3(z, u) = z + \u03c1u (Sd ),\nwhere \u03c1u is a linear transformation of Rd transforming the canonical basis into\nu. Any simplex T can be written under such a form, and we refer to the \"basis\nof T \" as such a choice of u, and denote it by uT = (uTi )1\u2264i\u2264d . Remark that\nsuch a choice is not unique.\nCall triangulation of Kd any finite simplicial partition of Kd . For T such\na triangulation, denote by X T the simplicial approximation of X with respect\n10\n\n\fto T , i.e. the function which is affine above each T in T and coincides with X\nabove the vertices of T . We will consider in this paper exclusively approximating\ntriangulations of a special form, described below. Denote by ST the finite set\nof all vectors u of Rd for which [z, z + u] is the edge of a simplex T of T , for\nsome z in Rd , and by\nCT = sup kuk\nu\u2208ST\n\nthe length of the longest edge in T .\nCall germ of triangulation any finite set of simplices T verifying the following\nproperty. There exists a network \u0393 of Rd such that\n{\u03b3 + T ; \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, T \u2208 T } is a partition of Rd .\n\n(10)\n\nAny network \u0393 satisfying (10) is said to be admissible for T , and the notation\n\u0393T refers to an arbitrary choice of such a network. Then define, for n \u2265 1,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n[\n1\ne\n(\u03b3 + T ) \u2229 Kd .\nTn =\nn\nT \u2208T ,\u03b3\u2208\u0393T\n\nProperty (10) ensures that Ten is indeed a partition of Kd . The problem is that\na set n\u22121 (\u03b3 + T ) \u2229 Kd might not be a simplex if it hits the boundary of Kd .\nHowever, those problematic simplexes won't play any role in the asymptotic\nconvex rearrangement because their number is negligible (it is proven later).\nSo, arbitrarily decide of a simplicial partition of each of these simplexes. The\nresult is a triangulation Tn that is a simplicial sub-partition of Ten , and differs\nfrom Ten only regarding the simplices touching the boundary of Kd .\nGiven a finite set of triangles T , denote by XnT = X Tn the corresponding\napproximation of X. Since XnT is a.e affine, denote by \u2207XnT its gradient, defined\na.e.. In all the paper, {bn ; n \u2265 1} stands for a sequence of positive numbers\nwhich aims to give sense to limn b1n M\u2207XnT (or, equivalently- see Theorem 1.2to limn b1n CXnT ). The renormalized gradient is defined up to a negligible set and\nis denoted by\n1\nYnT = \u2207XnT .\nbn\nUsing Theorem 1.2, to obtain the rearrangement of YnT , it is more convenient\nto work with its distribution \u03bcTn = \u03bcYnT .\n\n2.3\n\nRearrangements of centered Gaussian fields\n\nThe specific study of Gaussian fields yields more efficient tools to study the\nconvergence. We give here the statement of the main theorem of this paper,\nsome examples will be derived in the next section to illustrate the theory, for\nfractional Brownian fields and Brownian sheet. The generalized Lorenz curve\nplays a great role in the convex rearrangement of Gaussian processes, so we\nintroduce it now.\n\n11\n\n\fDefinition 2.1. Call \u03b3d the d-dimensional standard normal distribution. The\nd-dimensional generalized Lorenz curve is\n\nGLd = C\u03b3d .\nIn other words, it is the asymptotic convex rearrangement of any field which\nrenormalized gradient measure converges to \u03b3d . It corresponds in dimension\n1 to the classical Lorenz curve, frequently used in the fields of finance and\neconometrics.\nApproximate a centered Gaussian field X with covariance function \u03c3 on a\nT\ngerm of triangulation T by XnT . The gradient YnT = b\u22121\nn \u2207Xn has the following\n\u22121\nexpression along an edge [z, z + n u] of a simplex T of Tn ,\nhYn (z), ui = (n/bn )(X(z + n\u22121 u) \u2212 X(z)),\nwhence the covariance structure of the gradient field relies on EhYn (z), uihYn (\u03b6), vi\nfor [z, z + n\u22121 u] and [\u03b6, \u03b6 + n\u22121 v] edges of simplices of Tn . An easy computation\nyields\n(2)\nEhYn (z), uihYn (\u03b6), vi = (n/bn )2 \u03c3z,\u03b6 (n\u22121 u, n\u22121 v)\n(11)\nwhere\n(2)\n\n\u03c3z,\u03b6 (u, v) = \u03c3(z + u, \u03b6 + v) \u2212 \u03c3(z + u, \u03b6) \u2212 \u03c3(z, \u03b6 + v) + \u03c3(s, \u03b6)\nis the local second order increment of \u03c3. The following theorem gives a condition\nfor the convergence of E\u03c6Tn (h), where h \u2208 Rd and \u03c6Tn is the characteristic\nfunction of the image measure \u03bcTn = \u03bbd (YnT )\u22121 .\nTheorem 2.2. Assume that there is a function \u03c3zdiag (u, v), z \u2208 Kd , u, v \u2208 Rd ,\ncontinuous in z, such that for all u, v\n(2) \u22121\n(n/bn )2 \u03c3z,z\n(n u, n\u22121 v) \u2192 \u03c3zdiag (u, v)\n\n(12)\n\nuniformly in the z where it is defined. For a basis u and z \u2208 Kd , denote by \u03bcz,u\nthe Gaussian probability measure on Rd with covariance matrix (\u03c3zdiag (uTi , uTj ))ij\nin basis u, and let \u03c6z,u be its characteristic function. Then E\u03c6Tn (h) \u2192 \u03c6T (h),\nwith\nZ\nX\nT\nT\n\u03c6 (h) =\n\u03baT\n\u03c6z,u (h)dz,\n(13)\nKd\n\nT \u2208T\n\nwhere\n\nvol(T )\n.\nT \u2208T vol(T )\n\n\u03baT = P\n\nT\n\nIt means that \u03c6T is the characteristic function of the mixtures of the \u03bcz,u ,\nT \u2208 T , z \u2208 Kd .\n\n12\n\n\fProof. For T in T , denote by\nTnT = {n\u22121 (\u03b3 + T ) \u2208 Tn },\nall the simplices of Tn obtained by translation and rescaling of T . We have, for\nh in Rd ,\nZ\nX Z\nT\n\u03c6n (h) =\nexp(\u0131hYn (z), hi) =\nexp(\u0131hYn (z), hi)dz\n=\n\nKd\n\nS\u2208Tn\n\nX\n\nvol(S) exp(\u0131hYn (S), hi)\n\nS\n\nS\u2208Tn\n\nwhere Yn (S) stands for the common value of Yn over S.\nLet T = \u03a3(zT , uT ) be a simplex of T . If we put\nX\n\u03c6Tn (h) =\nvol(S) exp(\u0131hYn (S), hi),\nS\u2208TnT\n\nP\nT\nwe have \u03c6n =\nT \u2208T \u03c6n + cn , where cn is the integral over the area where\nsimplices of Tn touches the border. It is clear that \u2212CT /n \u2264 cn \u2264 CT /n,\nwhence cn \u2192 0 a.s.. For S = n\u22121 (\u03b3 + T ) = \u03a3(zS , n\u22121 uT ) a simplex of Tn we\nhave, by (11),\nEhYn (S), uTi ihYn (S), uTj i = (n/bn )2 \u03c3z(2)\n(n\u22121 uTi , n\u22121 uTj ).\nS ,zS\nFor z in Kd , denote by znT the closest point such that S = \u03a3(znT , n\u22121 uT ) is a\nsimplex of TnT , and let \u03c6zn (h) be the characteristic function of Yn (znT ). Using\nhypothesis (12), the expectation of this function converges pointwise (in z) to\nT\n\u03c6z,u (h) and is bounded by 1. Thus, by denoting S\u0304 = {z \u2208 Kd : znT \u2208 S} for\nS \u2208 TnT , we have\nZ\nZ\nX\nT\nE\nvol(S\u0304)\u03c6znS (h) = E\n\u03c6zn (h)dz \u2192\n\u03c6z,u (h)dz.\nKd\n\nS\u2208TnT\n\nThus\nE\u03c6Tn (h) = E\n\nX\n\nvol(S)\u03c6znS (h) \u2192 \u03baT\n\nKd\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n\u03c6z,u dz.\n\nKd\n\nS\u2208TnT\n\nSumming over T \u2208 T gives the result.\nThus the candidate for the limit, given by (13), is known, provided (12) is\nsatisfied. We state now the main theorem of this paper, which gives a more\nefficient condition for the weak convergence of \u03bcTn than Theorem 2.1.\n\n13\n\n\fTheorem 2.3.

We observed that there was a strong dependency on the choice of the triangulation used for approximating the field. In [5],\nit becomes apparent that for some 1-dimensional Gaussian processes, the Lorenz\ncurve seems a \"universal\" asymptotic convex rearrangement, in the sense that\nit is the same for polygonal and convoluted approximations.\nIn the multivariate case, the anisotropy of some fields make this universality\nimpossible. If \u03bcT is the limit measure, and \u03c1 is a rotation of Rd , measures\n\u03bc\u03c1(T ) \u03c1(*) and \u03bcT are in general different, unless the field is isotropic.

Indeed, denote by B1 (0, M ) the ball of radius M\nfor the k * k1 norm in Rd .

To conclude,\nwe need to show that the only possible limit of all convergent sub-sequence of\n{\u03bcn } is \u03bc. Let \u03bcn0 be a subsequence that converges to a measure \u03bc0 . Since\n\u2207fn0 converges for the L1 norm to \u2207f , according to the converse of Lebesgue\nTheorem, there is a subsequence \u2207fn00 that converges to\nR \u2207f a.e..

We consider a non-decreasing family of compacts\n{K\u03b5 ; \u03b5 > 0} whose union is int(K). The convergence holds on every K\u03b5 , \u03b5 > 0.\nDenote, for a function u on K, by u\u03b5 its restriction to K\u03b5 .

Let K be a compact convex set, and {fn ; n \u2265 1} a sequence of\nconvex functions that converge pointwise to a convex continuous function f on\nK. Then \u2207fn converges to \u2207f for the L1 norm on each convex compact subset\nof int(K).\nProof of Lemma 5.1. We prove the lemma in three steps.\nEquilipschitz convex functions on [0, 1]: For \u03ba > 0, let C\u03ba be the class\nof \u03ba-Lipschitz convex functions on [0, 1]. Assume that f and the (fn ) are in\nC\u03ba . Pick a dense countable subset S = {xk , k \u2208 N} in [0, 1]. Since the fn0\nare bounded (by \u03ba), by the diagonal sub-sequence method, we can find a sub0\n0\nsequence f\u03c3(n)\nsuch that, for all k, f\u03c3(n)\n(xk ) converges to some value g(xk ),\nwhere g is non-decreasing on S. Call also g its unique right-continuous nondecreasing continuation on [0, 1]. Let x be a continuity point of g and \u000f > 0.\nThen, let y \u2264 z be in S such that 0 \u2264 g(z) \u2212 g(y) \u2264 \u000f and y \u2264 x \u2264 z. For n\nlarge enough, since the fn0 are non-decreasing,\n\u22122\u000f \u2264 g(x) \u2212 g(z) + g(z) \u2212 fn0 (z) \u2264 g(x) \u2212 fn0 (x)\n\u2264 g(x) \u2212 g(y) + g(y) \u2212 fn0 (y) \u2264 2\u000f.\nHence fn0 converges to g in each of its continuity points, i.e almost everywhere\naccording to Riesz-Nagy theorem. Since g is bounded (by \u03ba), fn0 converges to g\n20\n\n\ffor the L1 norm, by Lebesgue theorem. By integration, g equals f 0 a.e and we\nhave the result.\nConvex functions on [0,1]: Drop the assumption that the fn are equilipschitz. Let I = [a, b] be a compact subinterval of ]0, 1[. Then, for each fn , for\nany x in I, we have, by convexity,\nfn (a) \u2212 fn (0)\nfn (1) \u2212 fn (b)\n\u2264 fn0 (x) \u2264\n.\na\n1\u2212b\nSince the left and right hand terms converge to finite values as n goes to \u221e, the\nfn are equilipschitz on I, and using the previous result, fn0 converges to f 0 for\nthe L1 norm on I.\nConvex functions on K: Let Ii , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d, be compact intervals of R such\nthat C = I1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Id is a compact rectangle contained in int(K).

The restriction of fn\nto Iz is hence the restriction of a 1-dimensional convex function that converges\nuniformly to the convex function f on Jz , and this case has been treated in the\nsecond part of the proof. Thus, each integrand Cn,i (z) converges pointwise to\n0.\nTo dominate it, we write Iz =: [az , bz ], and call cz a point in Iz where the\nmonotone function h\u2207fn (z, *), ei i reaches 0, or cz = az (arbitrarily) if 0 is not\nreached. Then, using the monotonicity of h\u2207fn (z, *), ei i, we have\nCn,i (z) \u2264 kfn (az )k + kfn (bz )k + 2kfn (cz )k + kh\u2207f, ei ikILz1\nIz\n\u2264 4kfn kC\n\u221e + kh\u2207f, ei ikL1\nIz\n\u2264 4kf kC\n\u221e + kh\u2207f, ei ikL1 + o(1).\n\n21\n\n\fThe last upper bound is due to the fact that the pointwise convergence of fn\nto f on the convex C yields uniform convergence. kh\u2207f, ei ikILz1 is integrable\nbecause \u2207f is integrable, and Lebesgue's theorem gives us the conclusion\nk\u2207fn \u2212 \u2207f kC\nL1 \u2192 0.\nNow, each convex compact subset of int(K) is contained in a finite union of\nsuch rectangles, and we have the conclusion.\nProof of (5) \u21d2 (7).\nThis result comes from the structure of convex functions, and of their gradients,\nthe monotone functions, so we first state a result that helps us apprehend the\ntopography of a monotone function.\nLemma 5.2. There is a family {K\u000f \u03b5 > 0} of closed subsets of K, satisfying\n(i) \u000f > \u000f0 \u21d2 K\u000f \u2282 K\u000f0 ,\nS\n(ii) \u000f>0 K\u000f = int(K),\n(iii) For any convex function f , positive number A and \u000f > 0,\n\u03bck\u2207f k ([A, \u221e[) \u2264 \u000f \u21d2 \u2200z \u2208 K\u000f , k\u2207f (z)k \u2264 2A.\nHence one can control the locations of points where f 's gradient reaches high\nvalues. In particular, k\u2207f k cannot be \"too large\" far from the edges of K.\nProof. Any convex function f on K satisfies\n\u2200 z, \u03b6 \u2208 K, h\u2207f (z) \u2212 \u2207f (\u03b6), z \u2212 \u03b6i \u2265 0.\nIt readily follows from the fact that the restriction of f to [z, \u03b6] is convex. Now,\nfor z \u2208 K, u \u2208 Rd , we introduce the affine cone\n\nZ(z, u) = {y \u2208 Kd : hy \u2212 z, ui \u2265\n\n1\nkz \u2212 ykkuk}.\n2\n\nWe have the property that\ny \u2208 Z(z, \u2207f (z)) \u21d2 k\u2207f (y)k \u2265\n\n1\nk\u2207f (z)k.\n2\n\nIndeed, let y be in Z(z, \u2207f (z)).\nk\u2207f (y)kky \u2212 zk \u2265 h\u2207f (y), y \u2212 zi \u2265 h\u2207f (z), y \u2212 zi \u2265\n\n1\nk\u2207f (z)kky \u2212 zk.\n2\n\nIt means that y in the cone Z(z, \u2207f (z)) cannot have a gradient too small,\ndue to the monotonicity property. Now we set \u000f(z) = inf u\u2208S d\u22121 \u03bbd (Z(z, u)),\n22\n\n\fwhich simply plays the role of a lower bound for \u03bbd (Z(z, \u2207f (z))). We have, for\nz \u2208 K,\n\u03bbd ({y \u2208 K : k\u2207f (y)k \u2265\n\n1\nk\u2207f (z)k}) \u2265 \u03bbd (Z(z, \u2207f (z)) \u2265 \u000f(z).\n2\n\n(24)\n\nNow we set, for \u000f > 0, K\u000f = {z \u2208 K : \u000f(z) \u2265 \u000f}. For z in K\u000f ,\nk\u2207f (z)k \u2265 2A \u21d2 \u03bck\u2207f k ([A, \u221e[) \u2265 \u03bbd ({y \u2208 K : k\u2207f (y)k \u2265\n\n1\nk\u2207f (z)k} \u2265 \u000f(z).\n2\n\nHence, given any positive number A, if \u2207f satisfies\n\u03bck\u2207fn k ([A, \u221e[) \u2264 \u03b5\nfor some \u03b5 > 0, then, according to (24), it follows that for z \u2208 K\u03b5\n\u000f(z) \u2265 \u03b5, and so k\u2207f (z)k \u2264 2A.\n\nTo finish the proof of the theorem, we have to show that fn converges to f\non int(K). In a first time we will use Ascoli-Arzela theorem to show that the\nfn uniformly converge on every K\u000f , and by consistency they converge pointwise\non int(K). Then we will show that the limit can be nothing but f .\nSince \u03bc\u2207fn weakly converges to the finite measure \u03bc\u2207f , it is a tight family\nof measures. For all \u000f > 0, we can find A > 0 such that, for all n in N,\n\u03bck\u2207fn k ([A, \u221e[) \u2264 \u000f.\nHence, according to Lemma 5.2,\n\u2200n \u2208 N, \u2200z \u2208 K\u000f , k\u2207fn (z)k \u2264 2A.\nFor a function u, call u\u03b5 its restriction to K\u03b5 . According to Ascoli-Arzela criterion, we know that for all \u000f > 0, {fn\u03b5 ; n \u2265 1} is a relatively compact family\nfor the uniform convergence. Now, let \u000f be a positive number. There exists a\nconvex function f\u000f and a sub-sequence f\u03c6\u000f (n) such that f\u03c6\u000f (n) \u2192 f\u000f uniformly\non K\u000f . Let us show that f\u000f coincides with f , which means that f is in fact the\nlimit as only possible limit for a sub-sequence.\nBy taking iteratively subsequences with the same arguments, one can complete f\u03b5 to a function f \u0303 on all int(K) such that, for each k \u2265 1, f\u03c6k (n) (z) \u2192 f \u0303(z)\nfor z in K\u03b5/k , where \u03c61 = \u03c6\u03b5 , and \u03c6k (n) is a subsequence of \u03c6k\u22121 (n).\nIn particular, using a diagonal extraction, there is a subsequence f\u03c6(n) that\nconverges pointwise to f \u0303 on K\u03b5 . According to the result (6) \u21d2 (5) proved\nearlier, we know that \u03bc\u2207fn \u21d2 \u03bc\u2207f \u0303, and so, by unicity of the limit, \u03bc\u2207f \u0303 = \u03bc\u2207f .\nHence \u2207f \u0303 and \u2207f are two monotone functions on K whose distributions\ncoincide. The uniqueness in Brenier's theorem (Th. 1.1) ensures us that they\n23\n\n\fare equal a.e.. We have proved that any cluster point f \u000f of (fn (z), z \u2208 K\u000f ) is\nequal to f on K\u000f . Hence f is the limit of fn for the uniform convergence on K\u000f .\nSince for convex functions on a convex compact set, uniform convergence and\npointwise convergence are equivalent, we have\n\u000f\n\u2200\u000f > 0, kfn (z) \u2212 f (z)kK\n\u221e \u21920\n\nwhich yields the result.\n\n5.2\n\nProof of Theorem 2.3\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we drop the exponent \"T \" in the proof, so \u03c6Tn = \u03c6n . We\nconsider here the quantity\nZ\n\u03c6n (h) =\nexp(\u0131hh, Yn (z)i)dz.\nKd\n\nThis integral can be discretized in a sum over all simplices S of Tn . For S in\nTn , denote by Yn (S) (resp. \u039bn (S)) the common value of Yn (resp. \u039bn ) over S.\nWe have\nX\n\u03c6n (h) =\nexp(\u0131hh, Yn (S)i)vol(S).\nS\u2208Tn\n\nTo prove that \u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h) converges a.s. to 0, we study the summability\nof the 4-th order moment\nE|\u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h)|4\ni\nh\n2\n= E (\u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h))2 \u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h)\n\"\n#\n4\nY\nX\n=E\nvol(Sk )(exp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i) \u2212 E exp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i))\nk=1\n\nSk \u2208Tn\n\nwith \u03b51 = \u03b52 = \u2212\u03b53 = \u2212\u03b54 = 1. Since \u03b5k Yn (Sk ) is a Gaussian vector with\ncovariance matrix \u039bn (Sk ), we have\nE|\u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h)|4\n\"\n#\n4\nY\nX\n=E\nvol(Sk )(exp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i) \u2212 exp(\u22121/2hh, \u039bn (Sk )hi)) .\nk=1\n\nSk \u2208Tn\n\nIf one develops the previous quantity, one obtains the sum of all products of\nfour terms of the form exp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i) or \u2212 exp(\u22121/2hh, \u039bn (S)hi).\nDenote by P the class of all subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}. Summing over all possible\nquadruples Q = (S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 ), and all possibles ways to write four terms of\n\n24\n\n\fone of the two forms described above, one obtains, with vol(Q) =\n\nQ4\n\nvol(Sk ),\n\nk=1\n\nE|\u03c6n (h) \u2212 E\u03c6n (h)|4\nX\nX Y\nY\n=\nvol(Q)\nE\nexp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i)\n(\u2212 exp(\u2212hh, \u039bn (Sk )hi))\nQ\u2208Tn4\n\nP \u2208P4\n\nX\n\nX\n\n=\n\nvol(Q)\n\nk\u2208P\n/\n\nk\u2208P\n|4\u2212P |\n\n(\u22121)\n\nP \u2208P4\n\nQ\u2208Tn4\n\nY\n\nE\n\nexp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i)\n\nY\n\nexp(\u2212hh, \u039bn (Sk )hi).\n\nk\u2208P\n/\n\nk\u2208P\n\n(25)\nSince\nE\n\nP\n\nk\u2208P\n\nY\n\n\u03b5k Yn (Sk ) is a Gaussian vector, one gets\n*\n\nexp(\u0131hh, \u03b5k Yn (Sk )i) = exp \u22121/2 h, cov\n\nk\u2208P\n\n! +!\nX\n\n\u03b5k Yn (Sk ) h\n\n.\n\nk\u2208P\n\nP\nThe\nP point of this computation is that cov( k \u03b5k Yn (Sk )) should be close to\nk\u2208P \u039bn (Sk ).
