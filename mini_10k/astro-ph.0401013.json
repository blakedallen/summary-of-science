The lensing\nmagnification effect allows us to search for changes in quasar spectroscopic and flux variability properties\nwith redshift over three orders of magnitude in intrinsic X-ray luminosity. It extends the study of\nquasar properties to unlensed X-ray flux levels as low as a few times 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the observed\n0.4\u20138 keV band. For the first time, these observations of lensed quasars have provided medium to\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio X-ray spectra of a sample of relatively high-redshift and low X-ray luminosity\nquasars. We find a possible correlation between the X-ray powerlaw photon index and X-ray luminosity\nof the gravitationally lensed radio-quiet quasar sample. The X-ray spectral slope steepens as the X-ray\nluminosity increases. This correlation is still significant when we combine our data with other samples\nof radio-quiet quasars with z > 1.5, especially in the low luminosity range between 1043 \u20131045.5 erg s\u22121 .\nThis result is surprising considering that such a correlation is not found for quasars with redshifts below\n1.5. We suggest that this correlation can be understood in the context of the hot-corona model for\nX-ray emission from quasar accretion disks, under the hypothesis that the quasars in our sample accrete\nvery close to their Eddington limits and the observed luminosity range is set by the range of black\nhole masses (this hypothesis is consistent with recent predictions of semi-analytic models for quasar\nevolution). The upper limits of X-ray variability of our relatively high redshift sample of lensed quasars\nare consistent with the known correlation between variability and luminosity observed in Seyfert 1s when\nthis correlation is extrapolated to the larger luminosities of our sample.\ndate (George et al. 2000; Reeves & Turner 2000). Another\nimportant parameter that describes the broad band spectral shape of quasars is the optical-to-X-ray spectral index,\nquantified as \u03b1ox = log(f2keV /f\n)/ log(\u03bd2keV /\u03bd\n),\n2500\u00c5\n2500 \u00c5\nwhere f2keV and f\nare the flux densities at 2 keV\n2500 \u00c5\nand 2500 \u00c5 in the quasar rest-frame, respectively. Recently, several studies have provided estimates of \u03b1ox for\nvery high redshift (z > 4) quasars (Vignali, Brandt, &\nSchneider 2003; Vignali et al. 2003a,b; Bechtold et al.\n2003). Vignali, Brandt, & Schneider (2003); Vignali et al.\n(2003a,b) found that \u03b1ox is mainly dependent on the ultraviolet luminosity while Bechtold et al. (2003) found that\n\u03b1ox primarily evolves with redshift. In addition to spectral\nstudies, variability studies of Seyfert galaxies show that the\nvariability amplitude (excess variance) is anti-correlated\nwith X-ray luminosity (Nandra et al. 1997; Leighly 1999).\nVariability studies have been extended to quasars by several groups (George et al. 2000; Almaini et al. 2000; Manners, Almaini, & Lawrence 2002). Low redshift quasars\n(z < 2) are found to have an excess variance consistent\nwith the luminosity relation found in Seyfert 1s and there\nis a possible upturn of X-ray variability for high redshift\nquasars with z > 2 (Almaini et al. 2000; Manners, Almaini, & Lawrence 2002).\nIt is also important to compare the properties of quasars\nnear the peak of their comoving number density, thought\nto have occurred at z \u223c 2, with low redshift quasars. This\ncomparison may provide clues as to what caused the dramatic decay of the quasar number density as the Universe\nexpanded.\nMost of the observational and analysis techniques em-\n\n1. introduction\n\nIt is important to extend the study of quasars to high\nredshifts in order to understand the evolution of quasars\nand their environments. One of the main results of recent\nstudies of quasar evolution is that the quasar luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly with redshift. (e.g. Boyle et al.\n1987). Many studies of quasar evolution are aimed at explaining this luminosity evolution. The X-ray band probes\nthe innermost regions of the central engine of the Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN). The study of AGN in X-rays may\npossibly answer the question of whether there is an evolution in their central engines and how this is related to the\nevolution of the quasar luminosity function. The observed\nX-ray continuum emission of AGN is generally modeled\nby a power law of the form N (E) = N0 (E/E0 )\u2212\u0393 where\nN (E) is the number of photons per unit energy interval.\nExtensive studies of AGN during the past decade indicate\nthat this power-law component is produced by Compton\nscattering of soft photons by hot electrons in a corona (e.g.,\nHaardt & Maraschi 1993; Haardt, Maraschi, & Ghisellini\n1994). The study of this power-law component, its correlations with other AGN parameters, and its evolution reveals important information on the accretion process of the\ncentral object. The X-ray photon indices of low-redshift\nradio-quiet quasars are measured to have mean values of\n\u223c2.6\u20132.7 in the ROSAT soft X-ray band (Laor et al. 1997;\nYuan et al. 1998) and \u223c1.9\u20132.0 for the ASCA hard X-ray\nband (George et al. 2000; Reeves & Turner 2000), and are\ncorrelated with the H\u03b2 FWHM (Reeves & Turner 2000).\nThere is no strong evidence that the X-ray power-law index\nevolves with redshift or correlates with X-ray luminosity to\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAI ET AL.\n\nployed to date to study the evolution and emission mechanism of faint, high-redshift quasars are based on either summing the individual spectra of many faint X-ray\nsources taken from a large and complete sample or obtaining deep X-ray observations of a few quasars. Although\nthese techniques may yield important constraints on the\naverage properties of high redshift quasars they each have\nsignificant limitations.\nGravitational lensing provides an additional method for\nstudying high-redshift quasars. The extra flux magnification, from a few to \u223c100, provided by the lensing effect enables us to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra\nand light-curves of distant quasars with less observing time\nand allows us to search for changes in quasar spectroscopic\nproperties and X-ray flux variability over three orders of\nmagnitude in intrinsic X-ray luminosity. With the aid of\nlensing, we can probe lower flux levels than other flux limited samples with similar instruments and exposures. This\ncould be an important factor because the X-ray properties\nof high-redshift, low-luminosity quasars could be different from those of other quasars and by studying them we\ncould possibly obtain information about the evolution of\nquasars.\nSimilar lensing studies have also been performed in\nthe sub-millimeter and CO bands (Barvainis & Ivison\n2002; Barvainis, Alloin, & Bremer 2002), which suggested\nthat gravitational lensing could be an efficient method\nfor studying various properties of high-redshift quasars.\nHere we present the results of an X-ray mini-survey of\nrelatively high redshift gravitationally lensed radio-quiet\nquasars. We chose only the radio-quiet quasars in our\nsample because the powerful relativistic jets in the radioloud quasars will introduce additional complication when\nmodeling the continuum X-ray emission from the accretion\ndisc.\nWe use a H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 = 0.5 cosmology throughout the paper.\n2. observations and data reduction\n\nOur mini-survey contains eleven gravitationally-lensed,\nradio-quiet quasars with redshifts ranging between 1.695\nand 3.911. Five of them contain Broad Absorption Lines\n(BALs) or mini-BALs in their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. Most of the lensed quasars of our sample were observed with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer\n(ACIS; Garmire et al. 2003) onboard Chandra as part of\na Guaranteed Time Observing program (Principal Investigator: G. Garmire). The data for two of the them were\nobtained through the public Chandra archive. Several of\nthem were observed twice. Three of the lensed quasars\nwere also observed with XMM-Newton. Table 1 presents\na log of observations, including redshifts, Galactic column\ndensities, and exposure times. Each observation was performed continuously with no interruptions.\nAll of the sources observed with Chandra were placed\nnear the aim point of the ACIS-S array, which is on the\nback-illuminated S3 chip. All of the data were taken in\nFAINT or VERY FAINT mode. The Chandra data were\nreduced with the CIAO 2.3 software tools provided by\nthe Chandra X-Ray Center (CXC) following the standard\nthreads on the CXC website. Only photons with standard\nASCA grades of 0, 2, 3, 4, 6 were used in the analysis.\n\nWe used events in the 0.4\u20138 keV energy range in the spectral analysis and events in the 0.2\u201310 keV range for the\nvariability studies. The source events were extracted from\ncircles with radii ranging from 3\u2032\u2032 to 5\u2032\u2032 depending on the\nseparations of the lensed images of each quasar. The circles included all of the lensed images. Background events\nwere extracted from annuli with inner and outer radii of\n10\u2032\u2032 and 30\u2032\u2032 , respectively, centered on the sources. We\nadjusted the inner and outer radii of the background subtraction annuli in some cases to avoid other sources in the\nfield. The background contributes an insignificant amount\nto the count rate in a source region, even during a background flare. The average exposure time for the Chandra\nobservations was about 25 ks. The detected source count\nrates ranged between 0.003\u20130.08 s\u22121 .\nThree targets were observed with the European Photon\nImaging Camera PN and MOS detectors (Str\u00fcder et al.\n2001; Turner et al. 2001) onboard XMM-Newton. The\nXMM-Newton data were analyzed with the standard analysis software, SAS 5.3. The tasks epchain and emchain\nfrom SAS were used to reduce the PN and MOS data and\nphotons of patterns \u2264 4 and \u2264 12 were selected from the\nPN and MOS data, respectively. The XMM-Newton data\nare affected more than the Chandra data by background\nflares because the Point Spread Function of XMM-Newton\nis significantly larger than that of Chandra-ACIS. Several strong background flares occurred during the XMMNewton observations. These flares are filtered out in the\nspetral analysis.\n3. spectral analysis\n\n3.1. Power-law Continuum\nWe performed spectral fitting in order to obtain the\npower-law indices of the X-ray continuum emission components of the quasars in our sample. The photon\nindices that we measured were in the observed 0.4\u20138\nkeV energy range. We used the Chandra data for all\nof the lensed quasars in the spectral analysis except\nPG 1115+080, where we used the XMM-Newton data.\nRX J0911.4+0551 and APM 08279+5255 were also observed with XMM-Newton. We did not use these data,\nhowever, because there were large amplitude and long\nduration background flares in the XMM-Newton observations. The background flare in the XMM-Newton observation of RX J0911.4+0551 almost spans the entire\nobservation. The background flare in the XMM-Newton\nobservation of APM 08279+5255 occurs during the last\n\u223c 20 ks of the observation. We filtered the background\nflare time from this observation and performed a spectral analysis to compare with our Chandra results. For\nour later correlation analysis, we used the Chandra data\nof APM 08279+5255 to avoid the possible complication\nfrom the cross calibration between Chandra and XMMNewton instruments. For those sources observed twice\nwith Chandra, we performed simultaneous fits to the spectra extracted from the two observations except in the case\nof APM 08279+5255, where we used only the second observation because it was much longer than the first one.\nWe extracted spectra for each quasar using the CIAO\ntool psextract. We extracted events from all of the lensed\nimages for each source except for the case of H 1413+117.\nA possible microlensing event in H 1413+117 appears to\n\n\fA Study of QSO Evolution in the X-Ray Band with the Aid of Gravitational Lensing\namplify and distort the spectrum of image A only and\nthus affects the spectral slope greatly (Chartas et al.\n2003). In this case, we extracted the spectrum of the microlensed image A and the spectrum of the other three\nimages separately. A microlensing event is also detected\nin Q 2237+0305. However, the spectral shape of the microlensed image A of Q 2237+0305 is not significantly affected by the microlensing event (Dai et al. 2003).\nSpectral fitting was performed with XSPEC V11.2 (Arnaud 1996). There are typically several hundreds (180\u2013\n6000) detected source events in the spectra of the target\nquasars, except for the spectrum of HE 2149\u22122745 which\nhas only 23 detected events. The moderate S/N of our\nspectra allows us to fit each of them individually using\nrelatively complex models. Thus we can constrain the underlying power-law slopes more accurately than in previous studies of unlensed quasars of similar redshift. The\nmodels we used are listed in Column 3 of Table 2. All\nspectral models included an underlying power-law model\nmodified by Galactic absorption. The Galactic absorbing\ncolumns were obtained from Dickey & Lockman (1990).\nTo account for the recently observed quantum efficiency\ndecay of ACIS, possibly caused by molecular contamination of the ACIS filters, we have applied a time-dependent\ncorrection to the ACIS quantum efficiency implemented\nin the XSPEC model ACISABS1.1.1 If the source was a\nBALQSO with a medium S/N spectrum, we added a neutral absorption component at the redshift of the source.\nFor high S/N BALQSO spectra such as PG 1115+080 and\nAPM 08279+5255 we used the absori model in XSPEC to\nmodel the intrinsic absorption component as an ionized\nabsorber (Chartas et al. 2002; Chartas, Brandt, & Gallagher 2003). We added a neutral absorption component\nat the redshift of the lens for Q 2237+0305 (Dai et al.\n2003). For some of the spectra containing emission or absorption line features, we added Gaussian line components\nto model them accordingly. The spectra of the quasars\nare displayed in Figures 1. The spectral fitting results are\ngiven in Table 2. In Table 2, we also list the observed 0.4\u20138\nkeV fluxes and rest-frame 0.2\u20132 keV and 2-10 keV luminosities for the lensed quasars in the sample not corrected\nfor the lensing magnification. The unlensed luminosities\nare calculated in \u00a74. We have corrected for the various absorption components when calculating X-ray luminosities.\nThese absorption components include Galactic absorption,\nabsorption in the lensing galaxy, intrinsic absorption, and\nthe ACIS contamination.\nThe mean photon index of the radio-quiet quasars in\nour sample is 1.78 \u00b1 0.06 with a dispersion of 0.27 \u00b1 0.08\nand the median photon index of the radio-quiet quasars in\nour sample is 1.86.\n3.2. \u03b1ox\nWe calculated the optical-to-X-ray power-law slope, \u03b1ox ,\nfor the quasars in our sample. The differential magnification between the optical and X-ray band is insignificant\nbecause both of the source regions are estimated to be\nmuch smaller than the Einstein radius. The rest-frame 2\n1\n\n3\n\nkeV flux densities were calculated from the best-fit models\nto the spectra of the quasars. The redshifts of our sample range from 1.7 to 4, thus the rest-frame 2 keV energy\nfalls in the 0.4\u20130.74 keV observed-frame energy range. We\nremoved all of the absorption components including the\nintrinsic ones for the BALQSOs when calculating the restframe 2 keV flux densities in order to study the properties\nof the intrinsic continuum. The rest-frame 2500 \u00c5 fluxes\nwere obtained from the published optical data in the literature and from current ongoing programs such as the CfAArizona Space Telescope LEns Survey (CASTLES) 2 and\nthe Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). 3\nWe first converted the optical magnitudes to flux densities\nat the effective wavelengths of the filters, then extrapolated them to the rest-frame 2500 \u00c5 flux densities. We\nused the standard relations between magnitudes and flux\ndensities for the V and R bands. For the F814W magnitudes obtained with the HST WFPC2, we used the relation from Holtzman et al. (1995) to convert between\nmagnitudes and flux densities. We used f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.7 in\nthe extrapolation. Typical quasar optical spectral indices\nare in the -0.5 to -0.9 range (Schneider et al. 2001). We\nchose the optical magnitudes from the bands closest to\nthe redshifted 2500 \u00c5 wavelength to reduce the error in\nthe extrapolation. We corrected the Galactic extinction\nbased on Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998). The extinction induced by the dust from the lensing galaxies is\nnot significant except for Q 2237+0305, which is lensed by\nthe central bulge of the galaxy. We corrected it according\nto the appendix of Agol, Jones, & Blaes (2000). The \u03b1ox\nvalues are listed in Table 3. The listed error-bars of \u03b1ox are\nat the 1\u03c3 level and account for the uncertainties in the Xray spectral slope and normalization, the conversion from\noptical magnitude to flux density and the extrapolation\nof the optical/UV spectrum. We note that a source may\nhave varied between the optical and X-ray observations\nthus leading to systematic errors in our estimates of \u03b1ox .\nFor the range of \u03b1ox in our sample, a change of optical\nflux by a factor of two will lead to a change of \u2206\u03b1ox \u223c 0.1.\nThe rest-frame 2 keV and 2500\u00c5 flux densities and restframe 2500\u00c5 luminosity densities are also listed in Table 3.\nThese values are corrected for lensing magnification as we\ndiscuss further in \u00a74. In conclusion we find that the mean\n\u03b1ox value for all the quasars in our sample is \u22121.70 \u00b1 0.02\n(\u22121.66 \u00b1 0.02 without HE 2149\u22122745 which has only 23\nX-ray events) with a dispersion of 0.20 \u00b1 0.03.\n4. magnification and intrinsic x-ray luminosities\n\nWe estimated the magnification for each of the lensed\nsystems in order to obtain the unlensed X-ray luminosities of the quasars. We first searched in the literature for\nmagnifications of well-modeled systems. However, not all\nof the systems in our sample have been previously modeled in detail and for some cases the magnification values\nare not included in the published analysis. We modeled\nthese systems with the gravlens 1.04 software tool developed by C. Keeton (Keeton 2001a,b). We used a singular\nisothermal elliptical (SIE) mass profile with external shear\n\nACISABS is an XSPEC model contributed to the Chandra users software exchange web-site http://asc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cont-soft/softlist.cgi.\n2 The CASTLES website is located at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/glensdata/.\n3 The OGLE website is located at http://bulge.princeton.edu/ \u0303ogle.\n\n\f4\n\nDAI ET AL.\n\nin most cases, and took into account optical image positions and flux ratios obtained from the CASTLES survey.\nWe assumed a 20% error-bar for the flux ratios to account\nfor uncertainties from microlensing or differences between\noptical and X-ray flux ratios. Our modeling results are\nlisted in Table 4. We compared the magnification values\nthat we obtained with those published in Barvainis & Ivison (2002) and found them to be in good agreement. We\nnote that the magnification values obtained may have large\nsystematic errors because the SIE model adopted in this\nanalysis may not be suitable for all the systems. For example, in PG 1115+080, a set of different mass potentials\nare used in the modeling of the magnification in Impey\net al. (1998). A magnification range of 20\u201346 was obtained for this system. Based on this example, we adopt\na factor of two as a typical systematic uncertainty in the\nmagnification. In \u00a76.1 we investigate how this systematic uncertainty could affect for our conclusions via Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n5. variability analysis\n\nThe light-curves for the Chandra observations of the\nlensed quasars of our sample are displayed in Figure 2\nbinned with a bin size of 1000 s (observed-frame). We\nshow the light-curves of the longer Chandra exposure if\ntwo Chandra observations of the same target are available. We excluded HE 2149\u22122745 in our timing analysis\nbecause of its low S/N (only 23 events).\nTo estimate the relative variability of the light-curves,\nwe used the normalized excess variance (Nandra et al.\n1997; Turner et al. 1999; Edelson et al. 2002) defined\nas\nN\n1 X\n2\n\u03c3rms\n=\n[(Xi \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212 \u03c3i2 ]\n(1)\nN \u03bc2 i=1\nwhere N is the number of bins in the light-curve, Xi are\nthe count rates per bin with error \u03c3i , and \u03bc is the mean\n2\ncount rate. The error on \u03c3rms\nis given by SD /[\u03bc2 (N )1/2 ],\nwhere\nN\n1 X\n2\n2\nSD =\n{[(Xi \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212 \u03c3i2 ] \u2212 \u03c3rms\n\u03bc2 }2 (2)\nN \u2212 1 i=1\nThis method normalizes the variability amplitude to the\nflux, thus is less biased towards the low flux light-curves.\nIt is better to apply this method to a sample of light-curves\nof similar lengths to avoid possible bias. For example, it\nwould be easier to detect long time-scale variability from\na light-curve with a long duration. In addition, the bin\nsizes should be similar in order to compare variability on\nsimilar time-scales. High S/N light-curves are needed for\nthis analysis as the variability could be easily dominated\nby noise in the low S/N light-curves. This excess variance\nmethod also has some limitations. One of them is that it\nis not very sensitive to short flares of moderate amplitude.\nThe excess variance values for Chandra light-curves with\nthree different bin sizes are listed in Table 5. We also calculated the excess variance for the three sources observed\nwith XMM-Newton and the results are listed in Table 6.\nThe background was subtracted in the calculation. Overall, the error-bars on the excess variance are quite large\nand in some cases, the values are negative. Therefore, for\nmost quasars we can really only obtain an upper limit on\nthe value of the excess variance.\n\n6. results and discussion\n\n6.1. Luminosity and Spectral Index\nThe unlensed 0.2\u20132 keV and 2\u201310 keV X-ray luminosities of the lensed quasars in our mini-survey range from\n1043 to 1046 erg s\u22121 . The mean spectral index of our sample, 1.78, is consistent with the value of 1.84 from the\nrecent study of very high redshift quasars (Vignali et al.\n2003b) and the value of 1.89 from the radio-quiet ASCA\nsample (Reeves & Turner 2000), especially when one considers the large dispersion of spectral indices in these studies and our small sample size.\nWe plot the rest-frame 0.2\u20132 keV and 2\u201310 keV X-ray\nluminosity against redshift in Figure 3(a), and the photon\nindices vs. redshift, 0.2\u20132 keV luminosity, and 2\u201310 keV\nluminosity in Figures 3(b), (c), and (d), respectively. Figures 3(c) and (d) show a correlation between the spectral\nindices of our sample of lensed quasars and their X-ray\nluminosities. We tested the significance of this correlation\nusing the Spearman's rank correlation method. We obtained a rank correlation coefficient of 0.94 significant at\nthe greater than 99.997% confidence level for the correlation between photon index and 0.2\u20132 keV luminosity and a\ncoefficient of 0.71 significant at the 98.6% confidence level\nfor the correlation between photon index and 2\u201310 keV\nluminosity. We note that the measured rest-frame 0.2\u2013\n2 keV luminosity for high redshift quasars obtained from\nChandra and XMM-Newton data is less accurate than the\nrest-frame 2\u201310 keV luminosity because it depends on extrapolation and suffers from the uncertainty in the absorbing columns towards the quasars. We adopt a significance\nat the 98.6% confidence level for this correlation, evaluated with the 2-10 keV luminosities. We also tested for a\npossible correlation between X-ray luminosity and redshift\nand between photon index and redshift and found none.\nThe correlation between the photon index and X-ray luminosity was a surprising result. Therefore, we tested if\nthis correlation is driven by certain data points. Excluding one of our data points at a time and performing the\nSpearman's rank correlation between \u0393 and the 0.2\u20132 keV\nluminosity to the rest of the data set, we find a strong correlation with a significance level greater than 99.98% each\ntime. We performed a similar analysis with the 2\u201310 keV\nluminosity, and the correlation is significant at the greater\nthan 95% confidence level each time. This indicates that\nthe correlation is not driven by any particular data point.\nWe further performed correlation tests by excluding data\npoints with errors in \u0393 larger than 0.20. Two data points\nare excluded and the rest of the data points still show\na correlation significant at the greater than 99.98% confidence level. The significance is at the 92% confidence\nlevel when 2\u201310 keV luminosities are used. We also tested\nif there is a bias from different flux levels in our sample\nsuch that quasars with low fluxes have a systematically\nflatter slope because of measurement errors. In principle,\nthis should not be a problem for the sample in this paper because some low luminosity quasars have high S/N\nspectra as a result of the gravitational lensing effect. To\ntest this, we simulated spectra with the same photon index (\u0393 = 2) but with a wide range of S/N and then fitted\nthem with the same models within XSPEC. We found that\n\n\fA Study of QSO Evolution in the X-Ray Band with the Aid of Gravitational Lensing\nfor low S/N spectra, when the total number of photons\nis less than \u223c200, the measured \u0393 could possibly be flatter by \u223c 0.1. This would affect three of our data points:\nHE 2149\u22122745, LBQS 1009\u22120252, and Q 1208+101 with\n(one low-luminosity and two high-luminosity quasars). We\ntested this effect by increasing the photon index by 0.1\nfor these three quasars and performed the correlation test\nagain and found the correlations between \u0393 and 0.2\u20132\nkeV (2\u201310 keV) luminosities are significant at the 99.99%\n(98.7%) confidence levels, respectively.\nA \u0393\u2013LX correlation has been previously searched for in\nother samples of radio-quiet quasars. Reeves et al. (1997)\nreported first a possible correlation between \u0393 and luminosity with nine radio-quiet quasars observed with ASCA.\nHowever, this correlation was later not found in the study\nof a larger sample of 27 radio-quiet quasars observed with\nASCA (including the original nine) by Reeves & Turner\n(2000). George et al. (2000) also searched for a correlation between \u0393 and luminosity in another sample of\nradio-quiet quasars observed with ASCA and did not find\none. However, the quasars in our sample all have relatively high redshifts 1.7 < z < 4 compared to the redshifts of quasars incorporated in previous studies of the\n\u0393\u2013LX correlation. There is only one out of 26 quasars\nwith z > 1.5 in the sample of George et al. (2000), and\nthere are six out of 27 quasars with z > 1.5 in the sample of Reeves & Turner (2000) and most of them have\nlarge errors on \u0393. In addition, the high redshift quasars in\nthe sample of George et al. (2000) and Reeves & Turner\n(2000) have high luminosities and span a small luminosity\nrange of 1045 \u20131046 erg s\u22121 . The sample of lensed quasars\nin this paper have lower luminosities and span a larger luminosity range of 1043 \u20131045 erg s\u22121 . Recently, Page et al.\n(2003) presented another sample of quasars observed with\nXMM-Newton which contains several high redshift, lowLX quasars. We plotted the \u0393\u2013LX diagram for quasars of\nz > 1.5 from the sample of Page et al. (2003), Reeves &\nTurner (2000), George et al. (2000), and Vignali et al.\n(1999) in Figure 4. We excluded one data point from Page\net al. (2003) with a large measurement error on \u0393. We\nalso excluded PHL 5200 from Reeves & Turner (2000)\nin our analysis because new XMM-Newton observations of\nthe object showed that most of the X-rays originate from a\nnearby radio source (Brinkmann, Ferrero, & Gliozzi 2002).\nWe corrected the X-ray luminosity of HE 1104\u22121805 reported in Reeves & Turner (2000) to account for the gravitational lensing magnification of about 12 based on our\nanalysis presented in \u00a74. We used rest-frame 2-10 keV\nluminosities in order to be consistent with the previous\nanalysis. Most of the data from Page et al. (2003) are\nconsistent with the \u0393\u2013LX correlation found in our sample of lensed quasars, especially in the low LX range between 1043.5 \u20131045.5 erg s\u22121 . On the high luminosity end\n(LX > 3 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 ) of high redshift quasars (z > 1.5),\nthe \u0393 dependence on LX seems to flatten out or even has\nan anti-correlation pattern. We performed the Spearman's\nrank correlation test to all of the (z > 1.5) quasars and did\nnot find a correlation between \u0393 and 2\u201310 keV luminosity.\nWe separated the quasars in two groups with luminosities below and above 3 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 and performed the\nrank correlation again to each group. The low luminosity\nquasars show a strong correlation between \u0393 and 2\u201310 keV\n\n5\n\nluminosity at the 99.97% confidence level and the high luminosity quasars show an anti-correlation between \u0393 and\n2\u201310 keV luminosity at the 98.9% confidence level.\nWe performed a Monte-Carlo simulation to test how\nmuch the \u0393\u2013LX correlation is affected by the uncertainty\nof the magnification factors of our lensed quasars. We used\nthe combined data sets from the lensed sample and from\nthe quasars of Page et al. (2003) with z > 1.5, which\nshow a strong \u0393\u2013LX correlation. We assumed a systematic uncertainty on the magnification of a factor of two\n(see discussion in \u00a74) and simulated 10,000 data sets with\nLX perturbed from its measured value randomly, within\nthe range of this error-bar. We fixed the data points from\nPage et al. (2003) at their original values. We performed\nthe Spearman's correlation test between \u0393 and 2\u201310 keV\nluminosity on the simulated data sets and found that the\n\u0393\u2013LX correlation in each simulated data set is at least\nsignificant at the 98.6% confidence level for 10,000 simulations and 9,888 of them have \u0393\u2013LX correlations significant\nat the greater than 99.5% confidence level. Therefore, it is\nunlikely that this correlation is driven by the uncertainties\nin the magnification factors.\nPossible errors in magnification factors, the small number of quasars in the present sample combined with the\nmedium S/N of several of the observations may have led\nto an unaccounted systematic effect. Additional observations of z \u223c 2 lensed quasars with better S/N and a more\ndetailed modeling of all the lenses in our sample will help\nconfirm this result. Although the \u0393\u2013LX correlation found\nin this paper could be a result of selection effect, we discuss\npossible interpretations of this correlation below.\nPrevious studies did not find any correlation between\n\u0393 and LX in low-redshift quasars and Seyfert 1s. Recently, several X-ray monitoring programs of Seyfert galaxies have indicated a correlation between X-ray spectral index and 2\u201310 keV X-ray flux (Chiang et al. 2000; Petrucci\net al. 2000; Vaughan & Edelson 2001). The spectra of\nthese Seyfert galaxies steepen as the X-ray flux increases.\nVaughan & Edelson (2001) suggested that variations of\nseveral properties of the X-ray emitting corona (e.g., electron temperature, optical depth, size) with the X-ray flux\nmay explain this \u0393 vs. X-ray-flux relation. Similarly, a \u0393\nvs. X-ray-flux relation also exists in some Seyfert 2 and\nradio-loud objects (Georgantopoulos & Papadakis 2001;\nZdziarski & Grandi 2001; Gliozzi, Sambruna, & Eracleous\n2003). These observations indicate that although the \u0393\u2013\nLX relation does not apply to a sample of low-redshift\nquasars and Seyferts, this relation applies to individual\nobjects. In contrast to the low-redshift quasars, the \u0393\u2013\nLX dependence found at high redshift, especially in highredshift and low-LX quasars indicates that these quasars\nmay represent a distinct sub-population of quasars. It is\npossible that the properties of the X-ray emitting coronae\nof the high-redshift quasars are more homogeneous than\nthose in the low-redshift quasars.\n6.2. Possible Interpretations of the Correlation Between\nthe X-Ray Luminosity and Spectral Index\nWe explore two possible interpretations of the correlation between the spectral index and the X-ray luminosity\nin the context of the model of Haardt & Maraschi (1993)\nand Haardt, Maraschi, & Ghisellini (1994). Our first hy-\n\n\f6\n\nDAI ET AL.\n\npothesis is that there is a narrow range (of order a few)\nof accreting black hole masses at high redshift while the\nobserved range of observed X-ray luminosities (spanning\naproximately two orders of magnitude) is caused by a large\nrange in the accretion rate, i.e., a wide range of Eddington ratios (the ratio of the accretion rate to the Eddington\nrate). Our second hypothesis is that the opposite is true,\nnamely that the range of accreting black hole masses at\nhigh redshift is large (spanning approximately two orders\nof magnitude), while the Eddington rate is fairly constant\nand close to unity (i.e., the accretion rate is always fairly\nclose to the Eddington limit, regardless of the mass).\nIn the model of Haardt & Maraschi (1993) and Haardt,\nMaraschi, & Ghisellini (1994) the inner accretion disk\nis sandwiched by a hot, tenuous, possibly patchy corona\nwhich emits the hard X-ray photons. The corona cools by\ninverse Compton scattering of soft photons (E <\n\u223c 100 eV)\nfrom the underlying disk, which results in the hard X-ray\nphotons that we observe. Haardt, Maraschi, & Ghisellini\n(1997) explored how the model predictions change for a\nwide range of the system parameters, namely the optical\ndepth and temperature of the corona and the temperature\nof the (assumed) black-body spectrum of seed photons. In\nparticular, Haardt, Maraschi, & Ghisellini (1997) found\nthat the 2\u201310 keV spectral index is nearly proportional to\nthe optical depth in the hot corona and also decreases as\nthe temperature of seed soft-photon spectrum increases.\nMoreover, in the case of a \"compact\" corona, i.e., one in\nwhich pair production is high enough that the Compton\nscattering optical depth is dominated by electron-positron\npairs, the 2\u201310 keV spectral index is nearly proportional to\nthe log of the 2\u201310 keV luminosity, just as we have found\nobservationally.\nIn our first hypothesis the observed range of luminosities is set by the range of accretion rates, with the black\nhole mass being nearly constant. In this context the observed correlation might be explained if the optical depth\nin the hot corona is somehow related to the accretion rate;\nfor example, the density of the corona could increase with\naccretion rate and so would the optical depth. There is a\ncompeting effect, however: as the accretion rate decreases\nso does the temperature of the underlying thin disk, which\nprovides the seed photons, with the result that the spectral\nindex of the emerging X-ray spectrum increases.\nIn our second hypothesis, the accretion rate for all objects is very close to the Eddington limit, while the observed range in luminosity is set by a range in black hole\nmasses. In the context of this hypothesis, and under the\nassumption that the optical depth of the corona is dominated by electron-positron pairs, Haardt, Maraschi, &\nGhisellini (1997) predict a correlation between the 2\u2013\n10 keV spectral index and luminosity just like the one we\nobserve. The optical depth in this case depends only on\nthe \"compactness\" of the corona, which can be expressed\nas lc \u223c 104 (h/r2 )(LX /LEdd) (Haardt & Maraschi 1993),\nwhere LX /LEdd is the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to\nthe Eddington luminosity (roughly proportional to the Eddington ratio) and h and r are the vertical and radial extent of the corona in units of the Schwartzschild radius.\nThus, in this scenario, the spectral index could increase\nif the compactness of the corona increases with black hole\nmass (See equation 16 of Haardt & Maraschi (1993)), with\n\nthe consequence that the emerging 2-10 keV luminosity\nincreases as well. Moreover, as the optical depth reaches\nunity, the spectral index reaches its maximum value and\nbegins to decline for larger optical depths. This feature\nmay explain the turnover that we observe in the spectral index vs luminosity plot of Figure 4. We therefore\nfavor this interpretation over the previous one. This interpretation is also appealing because it is consistent with\nthe predictions of semi-analytic models of Kauffmann &\nHaehnelt (2000) for the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes and their fueling rates. In particular,\nthese authors predict that at redshifts between 1.5 and 3,\nthe fueling rate of supermassive black holes in quasars are\nwithin a factor of a few of the Eddington limit, while their\nmasses span the range between 107 and 109 M\u2299 .\n6.3. The Optical-to-X-Ray Index, \u03b1ox\nVignali, Brandt, & Schneider (2003); Vignali et al.\n(2003a,b) found that the optical-to-X-ray index, \u03b1ox , of\nradio-quiet quasars is mainly dependent on the rest-frame\nultra-violet luminosity such that quasars with higher ultraviolet luminosities have steeper \u03b1ox values (see Figure 5).\nThey also do not detect a significant redshift dependence of\n\u03b1ox in their analysis, however, Bechtold et al. (2003) found\nthat \u03b1ox depends primarily on redshift (\u03b1ox steepens with\nincreasing redshift) and weakly on luminosity. We compare the average \u03b1ox , -1.70 (-1.66 without HE 2149\u22122745),\nof our sample with the average \u03b1ox , -1.71, of Vignali et al.\n(2003b), and the \u03b1ox values are consistent within the observed r.m.s. dispersion. The redshift range of our quasars\nis 1.7 < z < 4, lower than the sample of z > 4 quasars\nstudied in Vignali et al. (2003b). However, the consistency between the \u03b1ox values from the lensed sample in\nthis paper and the sample of z > 4 quasars studied in\nVignali et al. (2003b) does not rule out a possible small\nevolution of \u03b1ox with redshift due to our small sample size.\nWe plotted the \u03b1ox values from our lensed sample against\ntheir redshift and rest-frame 2500\u00c5 luminosity density in\nFigure 5(a) and (b), respectively. We performed the Spearman's rank correlation test between \u03b1ox and z and between\n\u03b1ox and L\n, but found no significant correlation in\n2500 \u00c5\neither case. Considering the large dispersion of the \u03b1ox\nvalues from the best fit \u03b1ox \u2013L\nrelation of Vignali,\n2500\u00c5\nBrandt, & Schneider (2003), it is not surprising that no\nsignificant correlation is found in our data set because of\nthe small sample size. We over-plotted our \u03b1ox data on\nthe \u03b1ox \u2013L\nrelation of Vignali, Brandt, & Schneider\n2500\u00c5\n(2003) with a dispersion of 0.25 as indicated by the shaded\nregion in Figure 5(b), and found that most of our data are\nconsistent with the \u03b1ox \u2013L\nrelation except one BAL\n2500\u00c5\nQSO data point.\nWe also searched for possible correlations between the\n\u03b1ox values and other properties of the quasars such as \u0393\nand LX . The correlation results were strongly biased by\nthe -2.1 \u03b1ox value of HE 2149\u22122745. When we removed\nthis data point, no significant correlation was detected.\n6.4. Short Time Scale Variability\nWe used the upper limits of the excess variance obtained from light-curves of bin size 1000 seconds when\ncomparing with results for local Seyferts and other high\nredshift quasars. This bin size corresponds to rest-frame\n\n\fA Study of QSO Evolution in the X-Ray Band with the Aid of Gravitational Lensing\ntime scales ranging from 200 to 370 s for the quasars in\nour sample and is similar to the time scales used in other\nshort time scale variability studies in Seyfert galaxies and\nquasars (e.g. Turner et al. 1999). We plotted the excess variances of the high redshift lensed quasar sample\ntogether with the variances for Seyfert 1s (Nandra et al.\n1997), NLS1s (Leighly 1999), LLAGN (Ptak et al. 1998),\nand high redshift (z > 2) quasars (Manners, Almaini, &\nLawrence 2002) in Figure 6. We fitted the Seyfert 1 points\nwith a power law and fixed the power-law index to the\nsame value reported in Nandra et al. (1997), allowing\nonly the normalization parameter to be free. The powerlaw relation is shown as a solid line in Figure 6. All of\nthe upper limits of the excess variances for the high redshift lensed quasars of this paper are consistent with the\n2\nSeyfert 1 \u03c3rms\n\u2013LX correlation. When we compare the upper limits with the NLS1s data, three of the upper limits\n2\nof our sample are located below the \u03c3rms\n\u2013LX relation for\nNLS1s, which have about an order of magnitude larger excess variance than the Seyfert 1s. The consistency between\nthe excess variance upper limits of our lensed sample and\n2\nthe Seyfert 1s \u03c3rms\n\u2013LX relation does not contradict the\npossible upturn in the value of the variability of z > 2\nquasars for quasars with luminosities of about 1046 erg s\u22121\nas presented by Manners, Almaini, & Lawrence (2002).\nMost of the quasars in our sample have redshifts greater\nthan 2, but the luminosity range of our sample is below\nthe luminosity range of Manners, Almaini, & Lawrence\n(2002).\nThe excess variance analysis that we discuss in this paper probes the shortest time-scale variability of radio-quiet\nquasars. There are two main interpretations that have\nbeen presented in previous studies to explain the excess\nvariance and luminosity relation. (e.g., Nandra et al. 1997;\nManners, Almaini, & Lawrence 2002). First, the more\nluminous sources may be physically large and lack the\nshort time-scale variability. Second, the more luminous\nsources may contain more independently flaring regions\nand these flares contribute less to the total flux for the\nmore luminous sources compared with the low luminous\nsources. There are several rapid flares observed in our\nlight-curve sample, in particular, such flares were detected\nin RX J0911.4+0551, Q 2237+0305, and PG 1115+080\n(Chartas et al. 2001; Dai et al. 2003, 2004). We performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to the light-curves of\nthe individual images of the systems, RX J0911.4+0551,\nQ 2237+0305, and PG 1115+080, and found the lightcurves are variable at the 99.8%, 97%, and 99.6% confidence levels, respectively. These observations support the\nsecond explanation where there are also flares in the high\nluminosity quasars, however, due to the quasar's high luminosity, flares contribute less to the total luminosity and\nthus luminous quasars have smaller excess variances.\n7. conclusions\n\n7\n\nWe presented results from a mini-survey of relatively\nhigh redshift (1.7 < z < 4) gravitationally lensed radioquiet quasars observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton. We demonstrated how gravitational lensing can be used to study high-redshift quasars.\nOur main conclusions are as follows:\n1. We find a possible correlation between the spectral\nslope and X-ray luminosity of the gravitationally\nlensed quasar sample. The X-ray spectral slope\nsteepens as the X-ray luminosity increases. The\nlimited number of quasars in the present sample\ncombined with the medium S/N of several of the\nobservations and the systematic uncertainties from\nthe lensing magnification modeling may have led to\nan unaccounted systematic effect. Additional observations of z \u223c 2 lensed quasars with better S/N\nand more detailed modeling of all the lenses in our\nsample will allow us to confirm this result.\nSuch a correlation is not observed in nearby z < 0.1\nquasars suggesting that quasars at redshifts near\nthe peak of their number density may have different accretion properties than low redshift quasars.\nWhen we combined the data from other samples\nof radio-quiet quasars selecting quasars with redshift (z > 1.5) together with the present lensed\nsample, the correlation is still significant, especially in the low X-ray luminosity range between\n1043\u221245.5 erg s\u22121 . If this correlation is confirmed\nby future studies, it could provide significant information on the emission mechanism and evolution of\nquasars.\nWe suggest that this correlation can be understood\nif we hypothesize that the quasars in our sample are\nfueled at rates near their Eddington limit (consistent with recent models for quasar evolution) and\nthat the optical depth of their X-ray emitting coronae increases with black hole mass.\n2. We did not find a strong correlation between the\noptical-to-X-ray spectral index, \u03b1ox , on either redshift or on UV luminosity in our small sample. However, most of our data points are consistent with\nthe \u03b1ox \u2013L\ncorrelation of Vignali, Brandt, &\n2500\u00c5\nSchneider (2003).\n3. Our estimated upper limits of X-ray variability of\nthe relatively high redshift lensed quasars sample is\nconsistent with the known correlation observed in\nSeyfert 1s.\n\nWe thank Steinn Sigurdsson and the anonymous referee\nfor very helpful comments and discussions.
