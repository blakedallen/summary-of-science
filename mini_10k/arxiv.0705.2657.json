SNPA is particularly useful when the impulse\ncontributions and the well-known long-ranged one-pion-exchanges predominate, as\nwas formulated in terms of the so-called chiral filtering [3]. However, if more complicated meson exchange processes are important, SNPA becomes model-dependent\nbecause the phenomenological description of the nuclear potentials and transition\noperators does not allow the unique description of their short-range behavior.\nThe merit of effective field theory (EFT) [4] is that it offers a systematic way\nto control short-range physics, which in principle allows more accurate theoretical\npredictions than achievable in the conventional approach [5]. An example is the\nhep process, 3 He + p \u2192 4 He + \u03bde + e+ , which is potentially important for solar\nneutrino physics. A reliable estimation of the S-factor for this reaction has been a\nlong-standing challenge in nuclear physics [6]; its theoretical estimates have varied\nby orders of magnitude in the literature. A highly elaborate SNPA calculation of\nthis S-factor was carried out by Marcucci et. al. [7], but it was a recent EFT-based\ncalculation by Park et al. [8] that provided definitive support to the SNPA results,\ngiving in addition a quantitative error estimate. In [8], the authors have developed\nan EFT approach, called EFT\u2217 or MEEFT (more effective effective field theory) and\nperformed a parameter-free calculation of the hep cross section, which has led to an\nestimate of the S-factor with \u223c15% precision; for a detailed review, see Ref. [9]. The\nsame method has marked successes also in describing the highly suppressed isoscalar\namplitude pertinent to the n+p \u2192 d+\u03b3 process [10, 11], as well as the weak processes\nlike muon capture on the deuteron [12] and \u03bd-d scattering [13, 14]. For a recent\nreview, see Ref. [15].\nThe strategy of MEEFT, as explained in [9, 8, 16], is in the spirit of the original\nWeinberg scheme [17] based on the chiral expansion of irreducible terms. In MEEFT\nthe relevant current operators are derived systematically by applying HB\u03c7PT to a\nspecified order. Nuclear matrix elements corresponding to these current operators are\nevaluated with the use of realistic nuclear wave functions obtained by applying an abinitio or quasi-ab-initio few-body calculation method to a realistic phenomenological\nnuclear Hamiltonian that involves high-precision phenomenological potentials. In\nMEEFT, as in the usual EFT, short-range physics is simulated by contact counterterms and the coefficients of these terms, called the low-energy constants (LECs), are\ndetermined by requiring that a selected set of experimental data is reproduced. This\nrenormalization procedure is expected to remove, to a large extent, model-dependence\nthat might creep in through the phenomenological parametrization of short-range\nphysics in the adopted nuclear interaction. We note that the strategy employed\nhere is closely related to the one used to construct a universal Vlow\u2212k in the recently\ndeveloped renormalization-group approach to nuclear interactions [18].\nThe purpose of this letter is to demonstrate that MEEFT provides a practical\nand reliable tool to compute the low energy M1 properties of few-nucleon systems\n2\n\n\fin a largely model-independent way. We calculate here four low-energy electromagnetic observables, namely the magnetic moments of 2 H, 3 He and 3 H and the rate\nof radiative capture of a thermal neutron on a proton. We derive all the relevant\noperators up to the next-to-next-to-next leading order (N3 LO) of the perturbation\nseries, which include the short-range contact terms. We use the experimental values\nof two of the above-mentioned four observables to fix the coefficients of the contact\nterms appearing at N3 LO and make prediction for the remaining two observables.\nWe test the consistency as well as the model-independence of the obtained results.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first EFT calculation of the magnetic moments of the\nA=3 systems.\nBefore closing this section, we remark that other EFT methods can also be\nadopted, at least in principle, for studying the M1 properties of few-nucleon systems\nat low energy. One of such possible alternatives consists in deriving not only the transition operators but also the nuclear interactions using the same EFT. This method\nhas the advantage of being more transparent in discussing the order counting and\nmodel-independence; for the recent developments in the EFT studies of nuclear potentials, see Refs. [19, 20, 21] and references therein. Such a study is expected to be\nhighly illuminating particularly for the electric transitions because gauge invariance\n(or charge conservation) is automatically guaranteed order by order. Another possibility is to use the so-called pionless EFT, where even the pions are integrated out\nleaving only the nucleon field as a pertinent degree of freedom. Pionless EFT has been\nsuccessfully applied to some processes involving two- or three-nucleon systems [22].\n\n2\n\nCurrent operators\n\nThe relevant operator for the magnetic moment and radiative np capture at\nthreshold is the M1 operator \u03bc(q),\n\u03bc(q) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\niq\n\u221a\n6\u03c0\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nM ag\nT\u030210\n(q)\n\n(1)\n\nM ag\nwhere T\u030210\n(q) is defined in [23], q \u03bc = (\u03c9, q) is the momentum carried out by the\n\u03bc\nphoton (q = 0 for the magnetic moment while q \u03bc 6= 0 for np capture), and q \u2261 |q|.\nWe derive the M1 operator in HB\u03c7PT, which contains the nucleons and pions as pertinent degrees of freedom with all other massive fields integrated out. In\nHB\u03c7PT the electromagnetic currents and M1 operator are expanded systematically\nwith increasing powers of Q/\u039b\u03c7 , where Q stands for the typical momentum scale\nof the process and/or the pion mass, and \u039b\u03c7 \u223c 4\u03c0f\u03c0 \u223c m \u223c 1 GeV is the chiral\nscale, f\u03c0 \u2243 92.4 MeV is the pion decay constant, and m is the nucleon mass. We\nremark that, while the nucleon momentum pi is of order of Q, its energy (\u223c p2i /m)\nis of order of Q2 /m, and consequently the four-momentum of the emitted photon q \u03bc\n(with \u03c9 = |q|) should also be counted as O(Q2 /m). In this work we include all the\ncontributions up to N3 LO, where N\u03bd LO denotes terms of order of (Q/\u039b\u03c7 )\u03bd compared\nto the leading one-body contribution. It is worth mentioning that there is a different\n\n3\n\n\fpower counting scheme where the nucleon mass is regarded as heavier than the chiral scale, see Refs. [19, 20] for details. However, the use of this alternative counting\nscheme would not affect the results to be reported in this article since the difference\nbetween the two counting schemes would appear only at orders higher than explicitly\nconsidered here (N3 LO).\nThe one-body (1B) M1 operator including the relativistic corrections reads\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\nX 1 n\n\u03bci \u2212 Qi\np\u03042i\np\u0304i \u03c3 i * p\u0304i\n\u01350 (qri ) \u03c3 i \u03bci \u2212 Qi 2 \u2212\n\u03bc1B (q) =\n2\n2m\n2m\n2m\np\ni\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\np\u03042i\nw(2\u03bci \u2212 Qi )\n+ \u01351 (qri ) Qi r i \u00d7 p\u0304i 1 \u2212\n\u2212\nir i \u00d7 (p\u0304i \u00d7 \u03c3 i )\n2m2\n4m\no\n(qri )2\n+\n\u01352 (qri )(3r\u0302 i r\u0302 i * \u03c3 i \u2212 \u03c3 i ) + * * *\n(2)\n30\njn (x) = 1 + O(x2 ), Qi = (1 + \u03c4iz )/2 is the charge of the i-th\nwhere \u0135n (x) \u2261 (2n+1)!!\nxn\nnucleon, and \u03bci = (\u03bcs + \u03c4iz \u03bcv )/2 is the magnetic moment in units of the nuclear\nmagneton, \u03bcN = e/(2mp ), with \u03bcs = \u03bcp + \u03bcn \u2243 0.8798 and \u03bcv = \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn \u2243 4.7059;\n\u2190\n\n\u2192\n\np\u0304i \u2261 21 (i \u2207i \u2212i \u2207i ) with the understanding that the derivatives act only on the wave\nfunctions, and ri \u2261 |ri |. In the above equation the familiar (\u03bci \u03c3 i + Qi ri \u00d7 p\u0304i ) term is\nof leading order (LO), while all the others terms are N2 LO. Since there are no N3 LO\ncontributions to the \u03bc1B , the neglected terms are of N4 LO and higher orders.\nCorrections to the 1B operator are due to the meson-exchange currents (MEC).\nUp to N3 LO, only two-body (2B) contributions enter; three-body (3B) currents are\nN4 LO or higher order. It is to be emphasized that MECs derived in EFT are meaningful only up to a certain momentum scale \u039b, where \u039b is the cutoff below which the\nchosen explicit degrees of freedom reside. This cutoff may be realized by introducing\na Gaussian regulator in performing the Fourier transformation of the MECs from momentum space to coordinate space [8]. It is to be noted that the contributions due to\nhigh momentum exchanges (above the cutoff scale) are not simply ignored but, as we\nwill discuss later, they are accounted for by the renormalization of the contact-term\ncoefficients.\nWe decompose the two-body current into the soft-one-pion-exchange (1\u03c0) term,\nvertex corrections to the one-pion exchange (1\u03c0C) term, the so-called fixed term\ncontribution (1\u03c0 : f ixed), the two-pion-exchanges (2\u03c0) term, and the contact-term\ncontribution (CT ),\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nXh\n1\u03c0:f ixed\n1\u03c0C\n2\u03c0\nCT\n\u03bc2B (q) =\n\u03bc1\u03c0\n+\n\u03bc\n+\n\u03bc\n+\n\u03bc\n+\n\u03bc\n= NLO + N3 LO.\n(3)\nij\nij\nij\nij\nij\ni<j\n\nThe leading MEC due to the soft-one-pion-exchange (1\u03c0) is NLO and given as\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\ngA2\n2 \u03c0\n(\u00d7)\n(\u00d7) \u03c0\n1\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03bc12 =\nT\u0302\ny (r) \u2212 y0\u039b (r) \u2212 T\u0302T y1\u039b (r) \u01350 (qR)\n8f\u03c02 S\n3 1\u039b\ng 2 m2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(r) + S12 y2\u039b\n(r)] \u01351 (qR) + * * * ,\n\u2212 A 2\u03c0 \u03c4\u00d7z R \u00d7 r [\u03c3 1 * \u03c3 2 \u02330\u039b\n24f\u03c0\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 1: Tree graphs of NLO and N3 LO.

This reduction of the effective number of counter\nterms is due to Fermi-Dirac statistics; a similar reduction has been noticed for the\nGamow-Teller operator [8], where only one linear combination of LECs needs to be\nretained.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nWe now use the M1 operators described above to calculate the magnetic moments of 3 He, 3 H and 2 H as well as the rate of radiative capture of a thermal neutron\n7\n\n\fon a proton, np \u2192 d\u03b3.

The \u03c8np (r) denotes the\nspin-singlet np scattering wave function obtained by applying the normalization condition limr\u2192\u221e unp (r) = r \u2212 as , where as is the spin-singlet np scattering length. The\nexp\nexperimental value of the radiative np capture cross section is \u03c3np\n= 332.6 \u00b1 0.7\n3/2\nexp\nmb [25], which corresponds to Mnp = 410.2 \u00b1 0.4 fm .\nA realistic nuclear Hamiltonian is constructed using a high-precision phenomenological potential. We consider here the Av18 bi-nucleon potential [26] with/without\nthe Urbana IX (U9) tri-nucleon force (3NF) [27], and we also consider the Argonne\nAv14 bi-nucleon potential with/without the Urbana VIII tri-nucleon force (U8). We\nremark that, from the HBChPT point of view, 3NF is N3 LO compared to the leading\nnucleon-nucleon interactions, and hence should be included in our N3 LO calculation.\nThe variational Monte Carlo (VMC) technique [27, 28] is used to solve the 3body Schroedinger equation in order to obtain wave functions of 3 H and 3 He. MEEFT\nis based on the assumption that the adopted nuclear wave functions are exact to\nthe order under consideration. This presupposes (i) the validity of using the highprecision phenomenological potential instead of an EFT-based potential, and (ii) the\nsufficient accuracy of the method used for solving the A-body Schroedinger equation\nfor a given phenomenological A-body Hamiltonian. The first point is a fundamental\nissue that awaits further detailed studies. As for the second point, we remark that\nthe long-range behavior of the wave functions can significantly affect the calculated\nnuclear transition matrix elements, and hence one should avoid using schematic wave\nfunctions. Unfortunately, it is difficult to fully quantify the uncertainty related to\nthe wave functions used in this work. One of indirect measures for the accuracy of\nthe adopted potentials and the VMC technique is the binding energies of 3 H and\n3\nHe. We give in Table 1 the results obtained in VMC for the Av18 and Av18+U9\npotentials; also shown in the table are the results obtained by solving the Faddeev\nequations [29, 30, 31]. Note that the use of 3NF is imperative in order to reproduce\nthe binding energies of 3 H and 3 He. Later in the text we shall give comparison of\nthe results for the M1 observables calculated with the Av18(+U9) potential and the\nAv14(+U8) potential, and this comparison provides another indirect measure for the\nstability of our results against changes in the input potential.\nThe cutoff \u039b has a physical meaning, and its choice is not arbitrary [32]. Thus \u039b\nshould be smaller than the masses of the vector mesons that have been integrated out.\nMeanwhile, since the pion is an explicit degree of freedom in our scheme, \u039b should\nbe much larger than the pion mass in order to ensure that all pertinent low-energy\n8\n\n\fTable 1: The binding energies (in MeV) of 3 H and 3 He calculated in the VMC method\nfor the Av18 and Av18+U9 potentials.

In the present work, we consider \u039b = 500, 600,\n700 and 800 MeV as representative values.\nFor a given value of \u039b, we adjust g4s and g4v to reproduce the experimental\nexp\nexp\n(or equivalently Mnp\n). We remark that the\nvalues of \u03bc(2 H) = 0.8574\u03bcN and \u03c3np\nfitted values of g4s and g4v depend on a particular choice of the potential model used\nto calculate the wave functions as well as the cutoff parameter. In Table 2, we show\nour predictions for the 3 H and 3 He magnetic moments obtained with the Av18+U9\npotential for the four representative values of \u039b; also shown are the values of g4s and\ng4v optimized for each value of \u039b. To highlight the roles of the contact terms, we\ninclude in the table the results corresponding to cases for which the contact terms are\nartificially dropped; see the entries in the square brackets. Table 2 indicates that the\nresults of the full calculation are almost independent of \u039b, whereas those obtained\nwithout the contact-term contributions show pronounced cutoff dependence.\nTable 3 shows the contributions of the individual M1 operators to the magnetic\nmoments of 3 He, 3 H and 2 H as well as the matrix element for np \u2192 d\u03b3, calculated\nwith the Av18+U9 potential for \u039b = 600 MeV. The table indicates that the NLO 1\u03c0\ncontribution is rather small, comparable to the total N3 LO contribution. Substantial\ncancellation among the various terms contributing to \u03bc1\u03c0 is responsible for this feature. Thus the \u03bc1\u03c0 contribution to Mnp , 8.7 in units of fm3/2 , can be decomposed as\n8.7 = (19.4 \u2212 14.4 + 4.0) \u2212 0.3, where the first three terms come from the first line of\neq.(4), and the fourth term from the second line.\nFinally, in Table 4 we compare the results for the different choices of the nuclear potentials; the table also gives the results of the SNPA calculations taken from\nRefs. [33, 34], as well as the experimental data [35]. The numbers in the parentheses\nrepresent statistical errors of our VMC calculation.

Our results are found to be almost independent\nof the interaction model and the cutoff values used, satisfying the general tenet of\nEFTs that the model- and cutoff-dependence should be of higher order than the order\nto which calculation is performed, i.e., N3 LO for the present case. This potentialindependence is also consistent with the notion of the Vlow\u2212k [36], which dictates that\nall the high-precision phenomenological potentials become universal if the cutoff is\nlowered to 2 fm\u22121 . Physically, this reflects the fact that the differences among various\nhigh-precision potentials lie only in the high-energy region that can be renormalized\naway leaving little effect for low-energy dynamics, provided that the renormalization\nprocedure is correctly done.\nComparison of the results with and without the tri-nucleon forces (3NF) in\nTable 4 indicates that the role of 3NF in the magnetic moments is small; the largest\neffect seen for the Av14+U8 case is of the level of 1%.\nOur no-parameter MEEFT calculation gives the values of \u03bc(3 H) + \u03bc(3 He) and\n\u03bc(3 H) \u2212 \u03bc(3 He) which agree with the experimental values at the 2-3 % level. This\nis slightly worse than the agreement reported in the SNPA calculations. We will\ncome back to this point in the next section. We emphasize, however, that as far as\nthe structure of the M1 operators is concerned, the present work gives a complete\nexpression, a feature that distinguishes MEEFT from SNPA.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have reported here the calculation of the magnetic moments of 3 H and 3 He\nbased on HBChPT. All the M1 operators up to N3 LO have been explicitly derived. At\nN3 LO, two unknown parameters, g4s and g4v , enter as the coefficients of contact terms.\nFollowing the MEEFT strategy, we have fixed them by imposing the renormalization\ncondition that the experimental values of the deuteron magnetic moment and thermal\nneutron capture rate on proton be reproduced at N3 LO.\n11\n\n\fConcerning the 2 \u223c 3 % discrepancy between the values of \u03bc(3 H) + \u03bc(3 He) and\n\u03bc(3 H) \u2212 \u03bc(3 He) obtained in our MEEFT calculation and the corresponding experimental values, there are a few points to be discussed. The first is the level of accuracy\nof the A = 3 wave functions obtained in the VMC method. The indication that the\nVMC wave functions deviate slightly from the accurate wave functions is already visible in Table 1, which shows that the binding energies of the A = 3 systems calculated\nin VMC do not quite agree with those obtained in the Faddeev calculation [29, 30, 31].\nAn attempt is in progress [24] to improve the present work with the use of ab initio\nwave functions obtainable in the Faddeev method and to extend our formalism to the\n3\nHe + n \u2192 4 He + \u03b3 reaction.\nThe second point is higher order contributions. As can be seen in Table 3, the\ndifference between theory and experiment is only about 30 % of N3 LO contributions,\nfor both isovector and isoscalar channel. Given the HB\u03c7PT expansion parameter, this\nsuggests that N4 LO effects of natural size can remedy the discrepancy. Among the\nN4 LO contributions, we expect the three-body (3B) currents \u2013 which appear first at\nN4 LO and hence have not been studied here\u2013 to play the most important role for the\nfollowing reasons. We note that a substantial portion of the higher-order two-body\ncontributions can be effectively absorbed into the renormalization of the coefficients\nof the contact terms; this is particularly true for short-ranged contributions. To illustrate this aspect, we consider the role of the 2\u03c0 contribution in our N3 LO calculation\nand compare the results of two \"2\u03c0-contribution-less\" calculations. In the first case,\nthe 2\u03c0 terms are simply dropped without any other accompanying changes, whereas\nin the second case the values of g4s and g4v are readjusted to reproduce the experimental values of \u03bc(2 H) and \u03c3np (without the 2\u03c0 contributions). We expect that the\nchange in the net results for the second case, which may be viewed as an effective 2\u03c0\ncontribution, is much smaller than the 2\u03c0 contribution estimated from the first case.\nWe have verified this feature numerically. From this example, we may expect that\nthe effective N4 LO 2B contributions are small. The situation is however completely\ndifferent for the 3B contribution in the M1 operator, (\u03bc3B ). Since \u03bc3B appears in the\nA = 3 systems but not in the A = 2 systems, its contribution cannot be absorbed into\nthe two-nucleon contact terms. The higher order calculation up to N4 LO is relegated\nto future work.\nFinally, we discuss the uncertainty related to the values of the LECs, c\u0304\u03c9 , c\u0304\u2206 and\n1\u03c0C\nN\u0304W Z , which appear in \u03bc1\u03c0C\n12 , eq. (6). The \u03bc12 contributions themselves are comparable in size to the difference between the present calculation and the experimental\ndata, as can be seen in Table 3. However, due to the above-mentioned renormaliza1\u03c0C\ntion procedure, the effective \u03bc12\ncontributions are expected to be small. We have\n1\u03c0C\nchecked this by turning off \u03bc12 and re-performing the renormalization procedure,\n1\u03c0C\nand found that the effective \u03bc12\ncontributions are negligible. If on the other hand\nwe naively treat these LECs as free parameters and adjust them to reproduce the experimental values, we are led to very large values of the LECs, which strongly violates\nthe naturalness condition.\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge invaluable discussions with, and support from, Professors Kuniharu Kubodera and Mannque Rho with whom this work was initiated.
