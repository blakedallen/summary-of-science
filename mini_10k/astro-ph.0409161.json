Astrophysical constraints from 'integrated\ntracking' are laid down to test the physical viability and cosmological compatibility of these\nparametrizations. A critical evaluation of the 4-index Hannestad parametrization is done.\nIt is found to be simple and transparent in probing the evolution of the dark energy during\nthe expansion history of the universe but it does not satisfy the BBN constraint on the dark\nenergy density parameter for the best fit values; however it looks more compatible with the\nobservations in the extended parameter space with w << \u22121.\n\n\f1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe recently discovered 16 Type Ia supernovae with the Hubble Telescope (Riess et al,2004)\nprovide a distinct scenario and conclusive evidence of the decelerating universe in the past\n(z > 1) evolving into the present day accelerating universe. Thus the existence of dark energy,which accelerates the cosmic expansion , has been firmly established and the magnitude\nof its energy density has been precisely determined (Wang and Tegmark,2004). The focus\nis now on the evolution of dark energy and its equation of state with the cosmic expansion.\nThe simplest and the most natural candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant \u039b\nwith a constant energy density \u03c1\u039b and a fixed equation of state parameter w = \u22121. But the\nrecent analysis of the SNe data (Alam et al 2004;Huterer et al 2004) indicates that the time\nvarying dark energy gives a better fit to observational data than a cosmological constant.\nThere are two contrasting prevalent views about the evolution of dark energy at present.\nRiess(2004) and Jassal et al(2004) have argued that the current SNe Ia observational data is\ninconsistent with the rapid evolution of w(z). On the other hand, Bassett et al(2004) contend\nthat the inconsistency arises on account of the inadequacy of 2-index parametrizations.\nThey claim that the rapid variation in w(z) in fact provides a better fit to the 'gold set'\nSNe observations, even after including CMB and large scale structure data (Corasaniti et\nal,2004). According to our analysis, the rapidity of variation | dw\n|, apart from other factors,\ndz\ndepends on the absolute value of |w|. For quintessence models \u22121 < w < \u2212 31 , whereas w\nhas no lower bound for phantom models. Hence the equation of state of dark energy varies\nmore rapidly for phantom models with large |w| than for quintessence models, other factors\nremaining unchanged. The fact that the observational data (Caldwell et al,2002) including\nSNe and galaxy clustering, shows a bias towards phantom models might explain why rapid\nvariation in w(z) provides a better fit to observational data.\nIt is difficult to know the exact functional form of the equaion of state w(z) observationally as such different parametric forms (Huterer and Turner ,2000; Weller and Albrecht,2001;Polarski et al,2001;Linder,2003;Padmanabhan et al,2004; Corasaniti et al,2004;\nAlam et al,2003 ) and non-parametric forms (Bassett et al,2002; Corasaniti and Copeland,2002;\nCorasaniti et al,2004; Bassett et al,2004) of w(z)have been used to simulate the behavior\nof evolving equation of state of dark energy and comparison made with the SNe observations. The SNe observations essentially measure the luminosity distance dL (z) which when\ncompared with the theoretical parametric values, yields the best fit values of the parameters\n(For details see Padmanabhan,2003). Odintsov and Nojiri(2004) have discussed the thermodynamics of the evolution of dark energy and have stressed that the phantom stage might\nbe a transient period in cosmic evolution.\nFor making a comparative study of various parametrizations and their viability, we need\nsome criterion. In our previous papers (Johri,2001,2002),we introduced the concept of 'integrated tracking' and outlined certain astrophysical constraints to be satisfied by the dark\nenergy fields for realistic tracking. For example, the dark energy density parameter at nucleosynthesis epoch (z = 1010 ) must satisfy the constraint\n(A)\n(\u03a9X )BBN < 0.14\nThe latest analysis (Olive et al,2004) constrains\n1\n\n\f(A)\n(\u03a9X )BBN < 0.21\nAgain at the point of transition from deceleration to acceleration phase of expansion, a\nviable parametrization must satisfy the constraint (corresponding to q = 0).\n1\n(B)\n(\u03a9X )T = \u2212 3w(z\nT)\nIn this paper, we have discussed the merits and demerits of four dark energy parametrizations, first three involving 2-parameters and the fourth (Hannestad, 2004) involving 4parameters. More parameters mean more degrees of freedom for adaptability to observations, at the same time more degeneracies in the determination of parameters. Hannestad\nparametrization is critically examined for its effectiveness and limitations to represent the\nvariation of w(z) in compatibility with the observations.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows In section 2, we have discussed the expansion history\nof the universe. Assuming a spatially flat universe,the field equations give the Hubble expansion and deceleration parameter in terms of function f (z) which involves integral of the varying equation of state of dark energy. In section 3, we have discussed 2-index parametrization\nmodels by Huterer and Turner(2002),Weller and Albrecht(2002), Linder(2003) and Padmanabhan et al (2004). In section 4, we have critically examined Hannestad parametrization\nmodel which involves 4 parametrs imparting four degrees of freedom to choose them. In\nsection 5, we use interpolation technique to study the behavior of the dark energy under the\nassumption of slowly varying equation of state. In section 6, we conclude with some remarks\non parametrization methods.\n\n2\n\nEXPANSION HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE\n\nAssuming a spatially flat (k=0) friedmann universe, the field equations are\nH 2 = Ho2 [\u03a9oM (1 + z)3 + \u03a9oX f (z)]\n\n(1)\n\n2q \u2212 1\n= w(z)\u03a9X\n3\n\n(2)\n\nand\n\nwhere H = \u0227a is the Hubble constant, q = \u2212 aH\u00e4 2 is the deceleration parameter, w(z) = p\u03c1X\nX\nis the equation of state of dark energy and \u03a9X = 1 \u2212 \u03a9M is the cosmic dark energy density\nparameter with \u03a9X = \u03a9oX f (z),\nf (z) = exp (3\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n0\n\n1 + w(z \u2032 ) \u2032\ndz )\n1 + z\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nThe luminosity distance is given by\ndL (z) = (1 + z)\n\nZ\n\nz\n0\n\ndz \u2032\nH(z \u2032 )\n\n(4)\n\nWe can test any parametrization by taking the best fit values and applying constraints\n(A) and (B) to check its compatibilty with the cosmological observations. The transition\nredshift may also be derived from the best fit values.\n2\n\n\f3\n\nTwo Index Parametrizations\n\nI. Linear Redshift Parametrization of w(z).\n(Huterer and Turner,2001; Weller and Albrecht,2002)\nw(z) = wo + w \u2032 z,\n\nw\u2032 =\n\n\u0010 dw \u0011\n\ndz\n\n(5)\n\nz=0\n\nInserting for w(z) in Eq.(3), we get\n\u2032\n\n\u03a9X = \u03a9oX (1 + z)3(1+wo \u2212w ) \u00d7 exp[3w \u2032z]\n\n(6)\n\nIt has been used (Riess et al, 2004) for probing SNe observations at z < 1. It diverges for\nlarge z. The best fit values for SNe 'gold set'(Dicus and Repko,2004) , wo = \u22121.4, w \u2032 =\n1.67, \u03a9oM = 0.3, zT = 0.39 give \u03a9X (zT ) = 0.63 whereas constraint (B) demands \u03a9X = 0.445.\nThis parametrization gives +40% deviation from the acceptable value of the dark energy\ndensity.\nII.Polarski and Linder Parametrization (Polarski,2001;Linder,2003)\nz\n(7)\nw(z) = wo + w1\n1+z\nw1\nOn differentiation, dw\n= (1+z)\n2 It indicates rapid variation of w(z) at z=0 which goes on\ndz\ndecreasing with increasing z. For large z, w(z) = wo + w1 .\nEq.(3) gives\n\n3w1 z\n]\n(8)\n1+z\nBest fit values for SNe 'gold set' (Dicus and Repko,2004;Gong,2004) wo = \u22121.6, w1 =\n3.3, \u03a9oM = 0.3, zT = 0.35 give \u03a9TX = 0.626 whereas contraint (B) demands \u03a9TX = 0.46;\nas such this parametrization gives +36% deviation from the acceptable value of dark energy\ndensity. Since wo + w1 > 0, \u03a9X diverges for large z. Also the BBN constraint (A) is not\nsatisfied.\nIII. Padmanabhan Parametrization(Jassal, Bagla and Padmanabhan,2004),\nw1 z\nw(z) = wo +\n(9)\n(1 + z)2\n\u03a9X = \u03a9oX (1 + z)3(1+wo +w1 ) \u00d7 exp[\u2212\n\n1 (1\u2212z)\n= w(1+z)\nFor z >> 1, w(z) = wo . Also dw\n3 . Therefore w(z) increases from z = 0 to z = 1\ndz\nthereafter starts decreasing.

The BBN constraint (B)\nis satisfied since for z >> 1, \u03a9X (z) \u223c (1 + z)3(1+wo ) and 1 + wo < 0.\nTherefore, Padmanabhan parametrization is compatible with astrophysical constraints\nand integrated tracking.\n3\n\n\f4\n\nHannestad Parametrization\n\nLet us now consider Hannestad parametrization (Hannestad and Mortsell,2004) which involves 4-parameters.\nan + anT\nw(z) = wo w1\nw1 an + wo anT\n\n1+z n\n)\n1 + ( 1+z\nT\n\n=\n\n1+z n\n)\nwo\u22121 + w1\u22121 ( 1+z\nT\n\n(11)\n\nwhere a = (1 + z)\u22121 , aT is the scale factor at the transition redshift zT , w0 and w1 are\nthe asymptotic values of w(z) as 1 + z \u2212\u2192 0 and z \u2212\u2192 \u221e respectively; n determines the\nrapidity of transition.\nIt follows that the equation of state at transition epoch is given by\nw(aT ) =\n\n2wo w1\nwo + w1\n\n(12)\n\nand the equation of state at the present epoch (z = 0) is given by\nw\u2217 =\n\nwo w1 (1 + anT )\nw1 + wo anT\n\n(13)\n\nOut of the 4 parameters, wo and w1 are taken to represent the asymptotic values and w \u2217\nand n are left free; alternatively w1 and w \u2217 may be given pre-assigned values and wo and n\ntaken as free parameters to match with the observations.\nDifferentiating Eq.(11) with respect to z, we get\nw \u22121\n\n(w1 \u2212 wo )n(1 + z)n\u22121 anT\ndw\n=\ndz\n[1 + (aT /a)n ][w1 + wo (aT /a)n ]\n\n(14)\n\nHence the equation of state of dark energy varies with the redshift unless w1 = wo or\n| varies\nw(z) takes asymptotic values 1 + z \u2192 0 or 1 + z \u2192 \u221e.

Substituting for zT in Eq.(17), we\n1\nfind \u03a9X (zT ) = 0.68 whereas constraint (B) demands \u03a9X (zT ) = \u2212 3w(z\n= 0.509. Thus\nT)\nHannestad parametrization gives +33.3% deviation from the acceptable value of dark energy\ndensity. Again, it is obvious from Eq.(18) that the dark energy density parameter diverges\nfor large values of redshift since 1 + w1 > 0 for the best fit values given above; as such\nconstraint (B) is not satisfied.\n\n5\n\nInterpolation of w(z) for Slowly Varying Equation of\nState\n\nIf we go by the analysis of Riess et al(2004) and Jassal et al(2004), the current SNe data\nis inconsistent with rapid evolution of dark energy. Therefore, we can use 'integrating\ntracking' and interpolation techniques applicable to slow time varying equation of state\n(Johri,Pramana,2002), It was shown (Johri, Class. & Quantum Gravity,2002) that the scalar\nfields with slowly varying equation of state which satisfy tracking criteria, are compatible\nwith astrophysical constraints (A) and (B) outlined under 'integrated tracking'. According\nto our analysis (Johri, Pramana,2002), based on integrated tracking, we have\n\u03a9X \u2264 0.14, w \u2243 \u22120.035\n\u03a9X = 0.66, w = \u22120.77\n\u03a9X = 0.5, w = \u22120.66\n\nat z = 1010\nat z = 0\nat zT = 0.414\n\nThe above data is consistent with the transition redshift given by Riess et al(2004) and\n(\u03a9X )BBN given by Cyburt et al(2004) To apply Hannestad parametrization,if we choose\nasymptotic values w1 = \u22120.035, wo = \u22121 (assuming quintessence dark energy),we get\nw(zT ) = \u22120.676 which yields zT = 0.405 and \u03a9X (zT ) = 0.493. These values are remarkably\nclose to the interpolated data given above.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have investigated the behavior of evolving dark energy by taking parametric representation of the equation of state. Out of the 2-parameter models of the equation of state,\nPadmanabhan parametrization is found to be valid and compatible with the astrophysical\nconstraints over a wide range of redshift.\n5\n\n\fBassett et al (2004) have discussed the limitations of 2-index parametrizations. Most of\nthem track well at low redshifts z \u2264 0.2 but if we explore dark energy for regions z > 1\nand w << \u22121 (beyond quintessence models), very rapid variation in w(z) can be found.\nHigher order parametrizations are more suitable for probing the nature of dark energy and\nits evolution since more parameters give more freedom to fit in observational data but at the\nsame time it gives rise to more degeneracies in the determination of the parameters,\nHannestad 4-parameter model of the equation of state provides a well- behaved representation of dark energy evolution over a long range of redshift but it fails to satisfy the\nBBN constraint for dark energy density for quintessence models w + 1 > 0 at nucleosynthesis epoch around z = 1010 . However, if the weak energy condition (WEC) is relaxed to\nadmit phantom models (w < \u22121), which are more favored by SNe and galaxy clustering\nobservations(Caldwell et al,2003), not only BBN constraint is satisfied but as an additional\nbonus, Hannestad parametrization admits rapid variation of the equation of state as well.\nSince there is no lower bound on w(z) for the phantom models, \u03a9X (z) also decreases steeply\nin the early universe if 1 + w1 is negative in Eq.(18).\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was done under the DST(SERC) Project, Govt. of India.
