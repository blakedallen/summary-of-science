In this way, via Noether\ntheorem, the homogeneity and isotropy of free space is directly related to the conservation\nof linear momentum P~ and angular momentum J~ respectively, and time homogeneity is\nrelated to energy E conservation. For a system of particles interacting through intermediate\nfields, global conservation laws are usually translated, via the equations of motion, into local\nconservation laws describing the interchange of dynamical variables between particles and\nfields. Under proper circumstances, the effects of macroscopic materials on the fields are\nsynthesized into boundary conditions for the fields. These boundary conditions define a set\nof field configurations (modes) that satisfy them. The mean value of the different dynamical\nvariables can be evaluated for each mode inside the region where boundary conditions are\nimposed. If this value of the dynamical variable can change in time just through its flow\non the boundaries, a conservation law for the dynamical variable associated to the field\nholds. For instance, the geometry of wave guides define the electromagnetic (EM) modes\nand the parameters which characterize them are linked to dynamical properties of the field.\nFor rectangular symmetry, the cartesian wave vector ~k is related to the momentum P~ of\nthe EM field, the frequency to the energy E per photon and the polarization to the spin\nangular momentum along ~k, Sz . For cylindrical symmetry the energy E per photon, linear\nmomentum P\u0302z , orbital momentum along the symmetry axis Lz and helicity Sz , define the\nparameters that characterize the electromagnetic Bessel modes: frequency \u03c9, wave vector\ncomponent along the symmetry axis kz , azimuthal integer m and polarization \u03c3. As shown\ntwenty years ago, Bessel modes [1], as well as other electromagnetic configurations coinciding\nwith modes inside wave guides of a given geometry, can be generated approximately in free\nspace by interferometric means. This has lead to the possibility of creating, in the quantum\nrealm, photons with a variety of quantum numbers which, in fact, can be entangled [2].\nThe purpose of this work is to study the dynamical properties of electromagnetic waves\nin elliptic-cylindrical coordinates. The corresponding modes are known as Mathieu fields.\nThe cylindrical symmetry leads, under ideal conditions, to propagation invariance along the\nsymmetry axis. Four of the five dynamical variables behind the parameters that characterize\nMathieu modes can be directly identified. The symmetry generator behind the fifth parameter is trivially obtained from the wave equations but its relation to the electromagnetic\n2\n\n\fdynamical variable is not, since the symmetry generator is of second order. We shall give\nan explicit expression for this dynamical variable.\nThe zeroth order Mathieu beams were first generated in free space by an annular slit\nilluminated with a strip pattern produced by a cylindrical lens [3]; higher order Mathieu\nbeams have already been generated by holographic means [4]. Given the increasing use\nof light to control the motion of atomic systems and microparticles we shall also make\nan analysis of the behavior of an atom in a Mathieu field. Emphasis will be given on\nthe dependence of mechanical effects on the values of that parameter and the associated\ndynamical variable.\n\nII.\n\nA MASSLESS SCALAR FIELD IN ELLIPTIC COORDINATES.\n\nElliptic-cylindrical coordinates are defined by the transformations [5]\nx + \u0131y = f cosh(u + \u0131v),\n\nu \u2208 [0, \u221e),\n\nv \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)\n\nz = z,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the real valued constant f is half the interfocal distance and the coordinates u and\nv are the so called radial- and angular-like variables, while z is the axial variable. Unitary\nvectors related to a given coordinate x will be written \u00eax . The relevant scaling factor for\nthis coordinate system is\nh = hu = hv = f\n\np\n(cosh 2u \u2212 cos 2v) /2.\n\n(2)\n\nConsidering the solution of the wave equation under the assumption of propagation invariance along the z-direction,\n2\n\u22072 \u03a8 = \u2202ct\n\u03a8,\n\n\u03a8(~r, t) = \u03c8(~r\u22a5 )e\u0131(kz z\u2212\u03c9t) ,\n\n(3)\n\nHelmholtz equation is obtained-partial derivatives with respect to a given variable x are\ncompactly denoted by \u2202x , also the notation \u2202ct = 1c \u2202t will be used. In elliptic coordinates,\nHelmholtz equation takes the form\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\u2202 + \u2202v + k\u22a5 \u03c8(u, v) = 0,\nh2 u\n3\n\n2\nk\u22a5\n\n\u03c92\n= 2 \u2212 kz2 .\nc\n\n(4)\n\n\fThis equation is separable, \u03c8(u, v) = U(u)V (v), and yields the set of differential equations\n\b 2\n\u2202u \u2212 b + 2q cosh 2u U(u) = 0,\n\b 2\n\u2202v + b \u2212 2q cos 2v V (v) = 0,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nknown as the modified and ordinary Mathieu equations, in that order, which will be called\nradial and angular Mathieu differential equations from now on. The real constant q is related\nto both half the interfocal distance f and the magnitude of the perpendicular component of\nthe wave vector k\u22a5 by\nq = (f k\u22a5 /2)2 .\n\n(7)\n\nFrom a field theoretical point of view, q is directly related to the perpendicular momentum\ncarried by the wave \u03c8. For a given value of q, the possible values of b compatible with the\nboundary condition V (v + \u03c0) = V (v) or V (v + 2\u03c0) = V (v) are called the characteristic\nvalues [6, 7]. They are usually ordered in ascending values and renamed an (bn ) for even,\np = e, (odd, p = o) solutions. The parity of the order n determines if the function is \u03c0or 2\u03c0-periodic for even or odd order n respectively. The mathematical set {\u03c8(u, v)(p,n,q)} is\ncomplete and orthogonal [8].\nFrom Mathieu radial (5) and angular (6) equations, it is straightforward to construct an\noperator that shares eigenfunctions with the squared transverse momentum,\nB \u03c8(u, v) = b \u03c8(u, v),\nB=\u2212\n\nf2 \b\ncos 2v \u2202u2 + cosh 2u \u2202v2 .\n2h2\n\n(8)\n\nA physical interpretation of the dimensionless eigenvalue b can be found writing the operator\nB in cartesian coordinates\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf2\nf2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2202y \u2212 y +\n\u2202x2 + 2xy\u2202x \u2202y + x\u2202x + y\u2202y ,\nB=\u2212 x \u2212\n2\n2\n1\nf2 2 .\nf2 2\nB = {lz+ lz\u2212 + lz\u2212 lz+ } \u2212 \u2207\u22a5 = l[z+ lz\u2212] \u2212 \u2207\u22a5 ,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the operator lz\u00b1 = \u2212\u0131 [(~r \u00b1 f \u00eax ) \u00d7 \u2207]z , in the context of the quantum mechanics of\na particle, is proportional to the z\u2212component of the angular momentum with respect to\neither focii of the elliptic-cylindrical coordinate system.\n4\n\n\fPrevious studies of Helmholtz equation, Eq. (4), already report this identification [9, 10].\nThat is the case of the analysis of the spectra of a quantum elliptic billiard for which B\ncommutes with the free particle Hamiltonian [9, 11]. In fact, \u03b2 = lz+ lz\u2212 + 2mf 2 H is a\nconstant of motion of the classical analogue of this system with m the mass of the particle\nand H the classical Hamiltonian within the billiard. It has been found [9, 12] that, if\nlz+ lz\u2212 > 0 then \u03b2 > 2mf 2 E and the classical trajectory of the particle repeatedly touches\nan ellipse characterized by cosh ulim = \u03b2/2mf 2 E. While, if lz+ lz\u2212 < 0 the trajectory always\nlies between the focii touching an hyperbola determined by cos vlim = \u03b2/2mf 2E. In that\ncase \u03b2 is a positive number and lz+ lz\u2212 has a lower limit given by \u22122mf 2 E.\nThe normalized amplitude of the scalar wave function \u03c8(u, v) is illustrated in Fig. 1 for\npositive and negative values of l[z+ lz\u2212] . Notice that, in analogy to the classical particle problem, for l[z+ lz\u2212] > 0 ellipses can be observed where the amplitude is approximately constant\nwhile for l[z+ lz\u2212] < 0 hyperbolic patters of similar amplitude are clearly distinguished.\n\nFigure 1:\n\n(Color Online) Normalized even Mathieu's functions a) \u03c8(u, v)(p=e,n=9,q=10) b)\n\n\u03c8(u, v)(p=e,n=9,q=80) . The corresponding values of the parameter b are 81.6283 and 124.1067, so\nthat l[z+ lz\u2212] = 61.6283 and l[z+ lz\u2212] = \u221244.1067 respectively. The half focal distance establishes\nlength units, f = 1.\n\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nDYNAMICAL VARIABLES OF AN ELLIPTIC ELECTROMAGNETIC\n\nMODE.\n\nGiven a complete set of scalar solutions {\u03a8\u03ba } of the wave equation, a joint set of complete\nelectromagnetic modes can be obtained by considering the scalar functions \u03a8\u03ba as Hertz\npotentials [13, 14]. In Coulomb gauge, any solution of the wave equation for the vector\n~ r, t)\nelectromagnetic field A(~\n~ r , t) = \u2202 2 A(~\n~ r, t)\n\u22072 A(~\nct\n\n(10)\n\ncan be written as a superposition of modes\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\n2\n(T E)\n(T M ) ~\n~\n~\n~\n\u2207\u22a5 \u2207 * \u00eaz \u03a8\u03ba \u2212 \u00eaz \u2207\u22a5 \u03a8\u03ba\nA\u03ba (~r, t) = A\u03ba \u2202ct \u2207 \u00d7 (\u00eaz \u03a8\u03ba ) + A\u03ba\n\n(11)\n(T E)\n\nwhere \u03ba denotes the labels that characterize a given scalar solution \u03a8\u03ba . The constants A\u03ba\n(T M )\n\nand A\u03ba\n\nare proportional to the amplitude of the transverse electric (TE) and transverse\n\nmagnetic (TM) EM fields as can be directly seen from their connection with the associated\n~ and magnetic B\n~ fields,\nelectric E\n~ = \u2212\u2202ct A,\n~\nE\n\n~ =\u2207\n~ \u00d7 A.\n~\nB\n\n(12)\n\nAs usual, although expressions may involve complex functions, just the real part of them\ndefine the corresponding physical quantities.

(11) inherit symmetries of the scalar field with analogous dynamical variables. For the elliptic-cylindrical case,\ninvariance under space reflection with respect to the Y axis leads to parity conservation.\n6\n\n\fMeanwhile, invariance under spatial translation along the main direction of propagation of\nthe mode is reflected in the fact that the field momentum-like integral\nZ\nh\ni\n1\n(i,\u03ba,\u03ba\u2032 )\n~ (i) \u00d7 B\n~ (i)\u2032 )z\nPz\n=\nd 3 x (E\ni = T E, T M\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n4\u03c0c\n\n(16)\n\nintegrated over the whole space is independent of time.

By construction ~k\u22a5 = ~ \u03c9 2 /c2 \u2212 kz2 would yield the magnitude of the\nis also constant.

As usual, for a given value of mode indices \u03ba, the helicity Sz is different\nfrom zero only if the amplitudes A(T M ) and A(T E) are complex. The concept of circular\nand linear polarization of Mathieu waves is analyzed in Ref. [20] classically. The quantum\nanalysis can be carried out in complete analogy with the study in Ref.

The interpretation\nof a dynamical variable for the EM field is usually linked to the interchange of this mechanical\nvariable with charged particles or atomic systems. The measurement of B\u0302 is expected to be\nrelated to changes in values of lz+ lz\u2212 although they have different units. It is thus essential\nto clarify how the absorption and/or emission of a Mathieu photon by a particle alters its\nmotion.\n\nIV.\n\nMECHANICAL EFFECTS ON ATOMS.\n\nTheoretical and experimental analysis on the interaction between light and microscopic\nparticles, as well as analysis on the interaction of light and cold atoms, have yield very\nimportant results in the last three decades. In these areas, the use of structured light\nbeams with peculiar dynamical properties plays an increasingly important role [21]. In the\nparticular case of Mathieu-like beams, it is possible to generate an elliptical orbital motion\nof trapped microscopic particles [22]. A detailed theoretical description of this phenomenon\nrequires the exhibition of a clear link between the observed motion and the parameters that\ncharacterize the beam, which are directly related to the mechanical properties of the field\ndescribed here.\nThe mechanical effects of a Mathieu electromagnetic wave on a cold atom shall briefly be\ndescribed under the assumption that the atom kinetic energy is low enough to be sensitive\nto light forces but large enough to admit a description in terms of Newton equations. The\nstandard semiclassical approach is taken, as in the pioneering works by Letokhov [23] and\nGordon and Ashkin [24]. In this approximation, a monochromatic electromagnetic wave\ndescribable by a coherent state couples to the dipole moment of an atom. This dipole\nmoment ~\u03bc12 is related to the electromagnetic transitions between the atom levels that, for\n10\n\n\fsimplicity sake, will be taken to have just two accessible options. The gradient of the coupling\n~ = |g|e\u0131\u03c6 determines the explicit expression for the average semiclassical velocity\ng = \u0131~\u03bc12 *E/~\n~ log(|g|) and \u03b2~ = \u2207\u03c6\n~ [24]. The nonlinear Newton\ndependent force through the vectors \u03b1\n~ =\u2207\nequations for Mathieu waves have a rich structure that deserves a deep study on its own.\nHere, just some results that illustrate the relevance of the parameter b are reported. Atomic\ntransitions with changes in the atomic internal angular momentum \u03b4m = \u00b11 are proportional\n~ r, t). For Mathieu waves, this factor is proportional to (\u03c9/c) AT E \u00b1 \u0131kz AT M\nto \u00ea\u00b1 * E(~\nreinforcing the interpretation of the latter expression as a signature of circular polarization.\nIn order to induce transitions with \u03b4m = \u00b11 with equal probability, and to avoid any\ncomplication arising from a component of the electric field along z, it will be assumed that\nAT M = 0.

This\nregime is particularly relevant in the context of optical lattices [26]. Following Ref. [25], the\nlaser beam is considered with a 67 nm detuning to the red of the 5 2 S1/2 - 5 2 P1/2 transition\nat 795 nm; a 6*105 W/cm2 irradiance is assumed. The trajectories of the atoms are described\n11\n\n\ftaking the laser wavelength as unit of length and as unit of time the inverse of the Einstein\ncoefficient \u0393 which is 3.7 \u00d7107 s\u22121 for the state 52 P1/2 of\n\n85\n\nRb.\n\nSince Newton equations are highly nonlinear, it is expected that the motion of the particles will not have a simple structure. Nevertheless, there are some general characteristics\nof the atom motion that can be predicted without making a numerical analysis. Thus,\nsince the z-dependence of the beam is just on its phase, kz z, no longitudinal confinement\nis expected. In the standard paraxial regime, k\u22a5 << kz , a correspondingly small transfer\nof radial momentum to the atom will occur. Under these conditions, the atom would be\nconfined by transversal light potential wells whenever its height is larger than the initial\natom kinetic energy. Conversely, if k\u22a5 \u223c kz the atom may dwell around different transverse\nwells. Typical trajectories are shown in Figs. 2-3 [31].\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Trajectory of an atom driven by an even Mathieu beam of order n = 0\nin the paraxial regime with half focal distance f = \u03bb, and beam parameters q = 0.0984 and\nb = \u22120.0048.

For paraxial beams, there is a time T such that the time average\nl+ l\u2212 over any interval t0 < t < t0 + T becomes independent of t0 whenever t0 > T . The order\nof magnitude of T is typically 104 \u0393. A rich structure, consistent with the frequent atomic\nrecoils due to the light potential wells, could be observed at lower scales. As expected, the\nspecific numerical results depend on all the involved variables. Once q and f are fixed, and\nfor the same atomic initial conditions, a monotonic nonlinear increase of l+ l\u2212 as a function of\nb is observed in general [29] as illustrated in Fig. 5. For non paraxial modes the time average\nl+ l\u2212 is highly dependent on the time interval considered due to the persistent increase of\n\n13\n\n\fthe radii of the atom motion illustrated in Fig. 3.\n\nFigure 4: (Color Online) Typical behavior of lz+ lz\u2212 as a function of time (black)and its average\n(white) for paraxial beams.

It has been proposed and shown that the transformation generator B arising\n14\n\n\fFigure 5: (Color Online) Average l+ l\u2212 of the atom, in units of \u03bb2 \u0393\u22121 , as a function of the b\nparameter of an odd Mathieu beam of order n = 1, 3, 5, 7 with half focal distance f = \u03bb and\nparameter q = 0.1.

However, although the possibility of optically trapping gold nanoparticles was demonstrated in 1994 [30], developing tweezers for\n\n15\n\n\fnanoparticles is not straightforward. The gradient forces with conventional beams, fall off\nwith particle size. The geometry of elliptical beams adds the focal distance 2f as parameter\nto tailor gradient forces besides opening the possibility of using the mechanical variable B\nto select over a wider kind of motions.\nThe inclusion and further study of this new dynamical variable could also help elucidating\nmodern concerns on the \"twisted\" properties of light, such as why Mathieu functions are\nintelligent states for the conjugate pair exponential of the angle\u2013angular momentum [27].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank S.

Differential equations are\nsolved using the prediction correction algorithms presented by L. F. Shampine And M. K.\nGordon in Computer Solution Of Ordinary Differential Equations: The Initial Value Problem\n(W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, U. S. A., 1975).\n[29] A remarkable exception corresponds to the case where the initial conditions yield an atomic\nmotion confined in an extremely narrow strip far away from the symmetry axis. In those cases\nl+ l\u2212 may get the same value or even decrease with respect to the average value obtained for\nlower values of the parameter b. Nevertheless this trajectories are very unstable. For instance,\nby changing just the initial angular variable v in a 1%, if trapped, the atom acquires a larger\nl+ l\u2212 value.\n[30] K. Svoboda and S. M. Block, Opt.
