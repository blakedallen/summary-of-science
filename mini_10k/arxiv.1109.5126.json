An interesting result is the observation that two identical chaotic systems, starting from different initial conditions can be synchronized on a stable chaotic time-evolution [7\u201311]. Even if the systems are slightly non-identical,\nthey may nonetheless converge onto an approximately synchronized chaotic time-evolution [12\u201319]. Stochastic synchronization for two coupled systems or for an arbitrary network in the presence of time delays has been studied in\n[20, 21]. Applications of synchronization of chaos include but are not limited to secure communication [22\u201326], system\nidentification [27\u201331], data assimilation [32, 33], sensors [34], information encoding and transmission [35, 36], and multiplexing [37]. In this paper, we show that two chaotic systems can be synchronized in the presence of a time-varying\nunknown communication-delay through an appropriate adaptive strategy; moreover, by using this adaptive strategy,\neach system is able to independently formulate a dynamical estimate of the unknown communication-delay.\nIt was proposed in [38] that the property of a system of being chaotic can be conveniently exploited in control\napplications. In this paper, we consider an identification problem where an unknown time-varying communicationdelay between two bidirectionally coupled systems is to be estimated. We show that choosing the dynamics of the\n\n\f2\nindividual systems to be chaotic is convenient in terms of the identification strategy. Moreover, by using our strategy\nwe are able to isochronally synchronize the two systems.\nAs a reference application, we consider the problem of identifying a time-varying communication-delay between two\nautonomous moving platforms, though we aim at presenting a general methodology rather than a specific application.\nMoreover, our paper provides new insight into the phenomenon of synchronization of chaos, as we are the first ones to\nformulate an adaptive strategy that successfully addresses synchronization of chaos and identification of time-varying\ncommunication-delays altogether.\nIn Sec. II we present the formulation of our problem and as a reference application, we introduce the problem of\nidentifying a time-varying communication-delay between two autonomous moving platforms. In Sec. III we formulate\nan adaptive strategy to identify unknown communication-delays in the case of non-autonomous systems, which is\nvalidated by using numerical simulations. In Sec. IV we show that a decentralized agreement protocol can be used\ntogether with our adaptive strategy to identify the coupling-delays for the case of autonomous systems. The effects\nof the choice of the initial conditions are investigated in Sec. V. In Sec. VI we present a modified adaptive strategy\nthat performs better in the presence of noise in the communication channels. Finally, the conclusions are given in\nSec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nFORMULATION\n\nA typical scheme for synchronization of two chaotic systems in the presence of communication-delays is the following\n[39\u201342],\n\n\u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), t) + \u0393i [H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4i )) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i ))],\n\n(1)\n\ni = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i). F : Rn \u00d7 R+ \u2192 Rn describes the dynamics of each uncoupled chaotic system, H : Rn \u2192 R is a\nscalar output function, \u0393i is an n-dimensional constant coupling vector, the communication-delay \u03c4i is the time that\nit takes for the signal broadcast by node j to be received by node i. The delays \u03c4i in Eq. (1) are assumed constant\nand known.\nNote that Eqs. (1) are a system of delay differential equations. Hence the solution xi (t), i = {1, 2}, is determined\nby knowledge of the initial conditions for xi over the time-interval [\u2212\u03c4max , 0], where \u03c4max = max(\u03c41 , \u03c42 ).\nIn the particular case in which x1 = x2 = xs , the terms in the square brackets of (4) vanish, and the two systems\n\n\f3\nevolve on the synchronous solution,\n\n\u1e8bs (t) = F (xs (t), t).\n\n(2)\n\nFor a given choice of the functions F and H, stability of the synchronized solution depends on the parameters \u03931 , \u03932 ,\n\u03c41 , and \u03c42 . In particular, a condition for stability is that the communication-delays \u03c4i be smaller than the characteristic\ntimescale Tx of an uncoupled system (2) [42],\n\n\u03c4i \u2264 Tx ,\n\n(3)\n\ni = {1, 2}.\nIf we assume that the communication-delay from i to j is the same as that from j to i, Eq. (1) reduces to\n\n\u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), t) + \u0393i [H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 )) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4 ))],\n\n(4)\n\ni = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i), \u03c41 = \u03c42 = \u03c4 . The assumption that the communication-delays are the same in both directions\nholds true for example for those applications that use line of sight communication.\nIn this paper, we choose the function F in (2) to generate synchronous (uncoupled) chaotic dynamics. Chaotic\nsignals have been successfully employed in cryptography and in secure communication [22, 43, 44]. Adaptive strategies\nbased on synchronization of chaos have also been proposed to dynamically identify the parameters of unknown systems\n[27\u201330]. In such applications, it is possible to exploit the specific properties of chaotic signals. In fact, since a chaotic\ntime trace never repeats in time, it provides an infinite amount of information that can be used by the identification\nstrategy (see e.g., [30, 45]). Moreover, adaptive strategies have been devised to synchronize self-sustained chaotic\nsystems [46].\nIn this paper, we propose an adaptive strategy that exploits the synchronizability property of chaotic systems to\nestimate a time-varying unknown communication-delay. Our goal is twofold:\ni) synchronizing the two systems;\nii) dynamically and independently estimating at each system the communication-delay.\nTo our knowledge, the use of adaptive strategies to simultaneously achieve synchronization and estimate unknown\ncommunication-delays has not been previously addressed in the literature. A strategy based on synchronization of\n\n\f4\nchaos to identify the unknown strengths of the couplings between two or more coupled systems has been proposed in\n[47] and implemented in [48\u201350]. Synchronization of chaos has also been used to identify and predict the dynamics\nof unknown real systems [27\u201330]. Adaptive strategies have been proposed to enhance synchronization of coupled\ndynamical systems by acting on the coupling strengths [51\u201353] and the topology of interconnections [54]. Unknown\nparameters have been adaptively estimated in the presence of time-delays in [55\u201359]. A technique to estimate the\ninternal delay of an unknown system has been proposed in [45]. The same problem has been studied in [60] for the\ncase of linear systems. In a recent paper [61], synchronization of chaos in the presence of an unknown communicationdelay is studied between two unidirectionally coupled systems, whose synchronization is guaranteed by a connection\nto an external master system. In this case, the problem of synchronizing the two systems is separate from that of\nidentifying the delay. In this paper, we consider two bidirectionally coupled systems, we do not assume connection\nto an external master system, and we formulate an adaptive strategy that can be used to simultaneously synchronize\nthe two systems and identify the delay.\nIn what follows we present the adaptive synchronization strategy in terms of a reference application. In particular, we\nconsider the problem of identifying a time-varying communication-delay between two autonomous moving platforms.\nWe assume that two identical chaotic oscillators are installed at each platform and that these chaotic systems seek\nto synchronize via a signal broadcast from one platform to the other (and viceversa). The signal received at each\nplatform is transmitted with a time-varying delay, which depends on the relative distance between the two platforms.\nInformation on the communication-delay can be used, e.g., to estimate the relative distance.\nEach platform is characterized by a pair of state variables {pi (t), xi (t)}, i = {1, 2}, where xi (t) \u2208 Rn is the state\nof an oscillator installed at platform i, and pi (t) \u2208 Rm is the position of the platform i. We assume that the\ntwo platforms seek to achieve mutual synchronization of the x's dynamics (the dynamics of the oscillators), while\nindependently moving along the trajectories pi (t). In order to achieve synchronization, each platform broadcasts a\nsignal which encodes information on the evolution of the x's dynamics. The signals are received with a non-negligible\ncommunication-delay, which depends on the relative motion of each platform with respect to each other.\nWe consider that each uncoupled oscillator is described by \u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), t). Moreover, we assume that pi (t)\ntypically evolves on a timescale Tp which is much longer than the timescale Tx on which an uncoupled system evolves,\nthat is,\n\nTp \u226b Tx .\n\n(5)\n\n\f5\nThis may be achieved, for example, by choosing the individual oscillators to have very fast dynamics, i.e., much faster\nthan the dynamics of pi (t), depending also on the specific application of interest. System i = {1, 2} broadcasts a signal\nH(xi (t)), which is received by j = (3 \u2212 i) with a delay \u03c4i (t), which is a function of both pi (t) and pj (t). Under our\nassumption that Tp \u226b Tx , we can approximate \u03c41 (t), \u03c42 (t) with the same delay, say \u03c4 (t), with \u03c4 (t) being a function\nof the distance kpi (t) \u2212 pj (t)k.\nWhen the platforms are coupled, the equations for the oscillators become,\n\n\u1e8bi (t) =F (xi (t), t) + \u0393i [ri (t) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))],\n\n(6a)\n\nri (t) =H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))),\n\n(6b)\n\ni = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i). Here, F, H, and \u0393i are the same as in Eq. (4). The received signal at node i, ri (t), propagates\nfrom node j to node i with a communication-delay \u03c4 (t). Note that in Eqs. (6a), we subtract from the received\nsignal H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) the internal signal H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))), i = {1, 2} , where \u03c4i\u2032 (t) is an estimate of \u03c4 (t) at node i.\nIn the particular case in which x1 = x2 = xs and \u03c41\u2032 = \u03c42\u2032 = \u03c4 , the terms in the square brackets of (6a) vanish,\nand the two systems evolve on the synchronous solution (2). Note that in this case, integration of the system of\nequations (6) requires knowledge at each time t of the state variables xi over the time-interval [t \u2212 \u03c4max (t), t], where\n\u03c4max (t) = max(\u03c4 (t), \u03c41\u2032 (t), \u03c42\u2032 (t)).\nA fundamental issue that typically arises when considering communication between two or more autonomous moving\nplatforms is that of synchronization of the time-clocks at each platform [62, 63]. For example, the problem of\nsynchronization of non-autonomous chaotic systems has been studied in [64]. In Sec. III we will assume the presence\nof two perfectly synchronized internal clocks at the two platforms. This is reflected by the choice of non-autonomous\nchaotic oscillators at the two platforms, \u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), t), for which the dynamics at the two oscillators explicitly\ndepends on the same variable t. As we will see, this requirement is important for the successfulness of the adaptive\nstrategy, i.e., for simultaneously synchronizing the two systems and correctly estimating the unknown communicationdelays. However, in Sec. IV we show that a decentralized agreement protocol can be used to estimate the delay and\nto synchronize the two oscillators for the case that they are autonomous systems.\n\n\f6\nA.\n\nUniqueness of the solution for both the cases of autonomous and non-autonomous oscillators\n\nWe now consider that the uncoupled dynamics at each platform is autonomous, i.e., we replace F (xi (t), t) \u2192 F (xi (t))\nin Eq. (6a). We show that when such a modification to our scheme is done, we become unable to univocally determine\nthe unknown delay \u03c4 , by requiring that the two systems synchronize, i.e., that H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 )) = H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 )) in Eqs.\n(6), i = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i).\nA chaotic time trace never repeats in time. Since H(xi (t)) in (6) is chaotic, i = {1, 2}, the only possibility for the\nreceived signal H(xj (t)) to cancel out with the internal signal H(xi (t)) over time is that the two chaotic time traces\nare the same one, possibly translated by a fixed time lag equal to \u2206, i.e.,\n\nx1 (t) = x2 (t \u2212 \u2206).\n\n(7)\n\nAn example of \u2206-lag synchronization between two chaotic time series (Eq. (7)) is shown in Fig. 1. Our goal in\nthis paper will be setting \u2206 to 0. Fig. 2 shows an example of lag synchronization between two identical P -periodic\ntime series. As can be seen, for this case, lag-synchronization is possible for value of the lags equal to \u2206 + N P ,\nwith N being any integer number. Thus using chaotic dynamics at the individual nodes restricts the possibility of\nlag-synchronization to only one lag \u2206.\nBy setting the coupling terms in the square brackets of Eqs. (6) to zero, and using (7), we obtain,\n\nx2 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = x2 (t \u2212 \u03c41\u2032 \u2212 \u2206),\n\n(8a)\n\nx2 (t \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2206) = x2 (t \u2212 \u03c42\u2032 ).\n\n(8b)\n\nAgain, by observing that x2 (t) is chaotic, Eqs.

As can be seen from the\nfigure, lag synchronization can be observed for lags equal to \u2206 + N P , with N being any integer number.\n\nin the square brackets of Eqs. (6), a general solution of the type (10) will arise, and not necessarily of type (11).\nThus to avoid ambiguities in resolving the coupling delays, hereafter we consider two alternative possible remedies,\none of which applies to nonautonomous systems and the other one applies to autonomous systems. As a first solution,\nwe assume that the dynamics of the uncoupled x's in Eqs. (6) are non-autonomous, i.e., they explicitly depend on\nthe time variable t. Then, if such dependence on t is appropriately chosen, under the assumption of chaotic dynamics\nfor the x's, we can rule out the possibility that Eq. (7) is satisfied for \u2206 6= 0. To better explain our point, let us recur\nto an example. Consider a simple periodic dependence on time of the type, \u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), sin(2\u03c0\u03bbt)); then the only\nway Eqs. (7) can be satisfied is for \u2206 being an integer multiple of \u03bb\u22121 , i.e., \u2206 = {0, \u03bb\u22121 , 2\u03bb\u22121 , ...}. However, not\nall of these solutions will be stable, with stability being typically bounded by a maximum allowed lag \u2206, say \u2206max\n(which depends on the autocorrelation time for an uncoupled system, see [42]). Therefore, by choosing \u03bb\u22121 > \u2206max ,\nwe can ensure that the only possible stable solution of type (7) is for \u2206 = 0. The advantage of this approach is that it\nuses the received signal (6b) as the only available information at each platform and from that it is able to reconstruct\nthe communication-delay with which the signal propagates from the receiver to the sender. The disadvantage is that\n\n\f9\nit requires the presence of two perfectly synchronized internal clocks at the two platforms.\nA second possible solution ensuring \u2206 = 0 in Eqs. (10) is to set \u03c42\u2032 = \u03c41\u2032 . In fact, with this condition, Eqs. (10)\nyields Eq. (11). However, we note that combining information available at the two different platforms to satisfy\nthe condition that \u03c42\u2032 be equal to \u03c41\u2032 may be unpractical. In Sec. IV, we introduce a decentralized agreement protocol\nwith this specific purpose. The advantage of this alternative strategy is that it allows to work with autonomous\ndynamical systems at the two platforms, rather than non-autonomous systems. The disadvantage is that it requires\nmore information exchanged between the two platforms.\n\nIII.\n\nADAPTIVE STRATEGY\n\nOur goal is independently estimating at each platform i the unknown communication-delay \u03c4 (t) from sole knowledge\nof the received signal ri (t), i = 1, 2. To this aim, we present an adaptive strategy to evolve \u03c4i\u2032 (t), the estimate at\nplatform i, to match the unknown communication-delay \u03c4 (t). At each node i, we consider a potential,\n\n\u03a8i (t) = [H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]2 .\n\n(12)\n\nFrom the considerations in Sec. IIA, we see that \u03a8i = 0 if (i) xj = xi and (ii) \u03c4i\u2032 = \u03c4 , i = 1, 2. Therefore, we seek to\nevolve our estimates \u03c4i\u2032 to minimize \u03a8i , through the following gradient descent relations,\n\u2202\u03a8i\n\u03c4 \u0307\u2032 i (t) = \u2212\u03b1i \u2032 = \u22122\u03b1i [H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]DH(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))\u1e8bi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)),\n\u2202\u03c4i\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b1i > 0, DH represents the derivative of the function H with respect to its argument. Note that (13) involves\nknowledge of the received signal ri (t) = H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))), the state xi at the past time (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 ), and its derivative \u1e8bi\ncalculated at time (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 ).\nWe note here that our proposed strategy, Eqs. (6,13), involves the solution of non-autonomous delay differential\nequations with state-dependent delays. In this paper, the stability of our strategy is tested via numerical simulations\nand provides interesting insights on the viability of our proposed approach. Namely, we show its effectiveness for\ndifferent systems, given that the initial guess on the time delay is sufficiently close to the actual initial delay. Furthermore, the sensitivity to the choice of the initial conditions and to the presence of noise in the communication channels\nis investigated in Secs.

We specify the initial conditions for (6) to be constant\nover the time-interval [\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0], where \u03c4\u0304max = maxt \u03c4max (t), and equal to randomly chosen points on the forced Van der Pol\nchaotic attractor. Moreover, we set \u03c41\u2032 (0) = 1.8, \u03c42\u2032 (0) = 0.20.\n\nA.\n\nNumerical Experiments\n\nIn what follows, we consider a numerical experiment, for which we choose the dynamics of each uncoupled system\n\u1e8bi = F (xi (t), t) to be described by the forced Van der Pol oscillator. We restrict the parameters of the coupled\nequations to be such that with no adaption being performed and \u03c41\u2032 (t) = \u03c42\u2032 (t) = \u03c4 (t), the synchronous solution (2) is\nstable. This also corresponds to setting a maximum value on the communication-delay \u03c4 (t), as stability requires that\n\u03c4 does not exceed the autocorrelation time of an uncoupled system (for more details, see [42]).\nWe set xi (t) = [xi1 (t), xi2 (t)],\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\nF (xi1 (t), xi2 (t), t) = \uf8f0\n\n\uf8f9\n\nxi2 (t)\n2\n\n\u2212xi1 (t) + 8.53xi2 (t)[1 \u2212 xi1 (t) ] + f (t)\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb,\n\n(14)\n\n\f11\nwhere,\n\nf (t) = a cos(2\u03c0\u03bct),\n\n(15)\n\na = 1.2, \u03bc = 0.1, and we set H(xi (t)) = xi2 (t), \u0393i = [0, \u03b3i ].\nWe integrate the set of equations (6,13), with\n\n\u03c4 (t) = T + \u03b6 sin(\u03c9t),\n\n(16)\n\n\u03c9 = 10\u22123 and we set T = 1, \u03b6 = 0.5. We set the initial conditions for (6) to be constant over the time-interval\n[\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0], where \u03c4\u0304max = maxt \u03c4max (t) and equal to randomly chosen points on the forced Van der Pol chaotic\nattractor. We set \u03c41\u2032 (0) = 1.8, \u03c42\u2032 (0) = 0.20 (note that integration of Eqs. (6,13) only requires knowledge of the delays\n\u03c4i\u2032 at the current time t).\nThe results of our computations are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the adaptive strategy is successful in\nsynchronizing the oscillators' states x1 and x2 on a zero-lag synchronous solution, with \u03c41\u2032 (t), \u03c42\u2032 (t) converging on the\ntrue evolution \u03c4 (t).\n\nIV.\n\nA DECENTRALIZED AGREEMENT PROTOCOL FOR AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS\n\nIn this section we focus on the case that the two coupled oscillators are autonomous systems, i.e., we replace\n\u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t), t) in Eqs. (6) by \u1e8bi (t) = F (xi (t)). For this case, the existence of only one solution of type (11) can\nbe ensured by satisfaction of the extra condition that \u03c41\u2032 = \u03c42\u2032 (see the discussion in Sec. IIA). In order to satisfy this\nadditional requirement, we introduce a decentralized agreement protocol between the two platforms that consists in\neach oscillator i communicating to oscillator j = (3 \u2212 i) its estimate \u03c4i\u2032 of the unknown delay. With this modification,\neach platform j receives at each time two signals, that is, the signal rj = H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) and the delay estimate\n\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)). With this extra piece of information available, we reformulate the potential in (12) as follows,\n\u03a8\u0302i (t) = \u03a8i (t) + \u03ba[\u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)) \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))]2 ,\n\n(17)\n\ni = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i), where \u03ba > 0 is an appropriate scalar. Note that in defining (17), we have taken into account\nthe transmission-time \u03c4 needed for the estimate \u03c4j\u2032 to propagate from platform j to platform i. We note that, as we\n\n\f12\nsee from the relations (3,5), \u03c4 evolves on a timescale that is much longer than \u03c4 itself, thus we do not expect it to\nvary much over the propagation-time of the signal. We observe from (17) that the potential \u03a8\u0302i \u2265 0 by definition.\nThen, in order for the potential (17) to be zero, it is simultaneously needed that \u03a8i equals zero and \u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) equals\n\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 ). Thus we introduce the following gradient descent relation for evolving the estimates \u03c4i\u2032 ,\n\u2202 \u03a8\u0302i\n\u03c4 \u0307\u2032 i = \u2212\u03b1i \u2032 = \u22122\u03b1i {[H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]DH(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))\u1e8bi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)) \u2212 \u03ba[\u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)) \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))]},\n\u2202\u03c4i\n(18)\n\u03b1i > 0. Note that (18) involves knowledge of the two received signals H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) and \u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)), along with\nknowledge of the state xi , of its derivative \u1e8bi , and of the estimate \u03c4i\u2032 calculated at the past time (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 ). The results\nof our computations are shown in Fig. 4. We choose the dynamics of each individual system to be described by the\nR\u00f6ssler autonomous equation, xi (t) = [xi1 (t), xi2 (t), xi3 (t)],\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\nF (xi1 (t), xi2 (t), xi3 (t), t) = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\u2212xi2 (t) \u2212 xi3 (t)\nxi1 (t) + 0.2xi2 (t)\nxi3 (t)[xi1 (t) \u2212 7] + 0.2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n(19)\n\nWe integrate the set of equations (6,19,18) with H(xi (t)) = xi1 (t), \u0393i = [\u03b3i , 0, 0]. The unknown delay \u03c4 evolves\naccording to Eq. (16) with T = 0.3, \u03b6 = 0.15, \u03c9 = 10\u22123 . We set \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 10\u22124 /2, \u03b31 = 0.6, \u03b32 = 0.5, and \u03ba = 1. We\nselect the initial conditions for xi1 , xi2 , xi3 to be constant over the time-interval [\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0], where \u03c4\u0304max = maxt \u03c4max (t),\nand equal to randomly chosen points on the R\u00f6ssler chaotic attractor, \u03c41\u2032 (0) = 0.65, \u03c42\u2032 (0) = 0.10. As can be seen,\nthe adaptive strategy along with the decentralized agreement protocol is successful in synchronizing the oscillators'\nstates x1 and x2 on a zero-lag synchronous solution, with \u03c41\u2032 (t) and \u03c42\u2032 (t) converging on the true evolution \u03c4 (t).\nFurthermore, we have tested the performance of the adaptive strategy described in this section with respect to\ndifferent sets of parameters. We have run numerical simulations in which we integrate the set of equations (6,18,19)\nwith \u03ba = 1 and \u03c4 evolving according to (16), T = 0.4, \u03b6 = 0.2, \u03c9 = 10\u22123 .

Indeed, the version of\nthe adaptive strategy that applies to autonomous systems does not require the presence of synchronized clocks at the\ntwo platforms; hence, it could be used to synchronize two autonomous clocks in the presence of clock drifts or skews\n(see [65] for a survey on clock synchronization) or to estimate propagation delays in an asynchronous code-division\n\n\f14\n\n<E1>\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u03b31=\u03b32\n\n1.5\n\n(b)\n\n0.4\n\n<E1>\n\n2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\u22126\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u03b11=\u03b12\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: We integrate the set of equations (6,18,19) with \u03c4 evolving according to (16) with T = 0.4, \u03b6 = 0.2, \u03c9 = 10\u22123 .

We consider both the forced Van der Pol equation (14) as well as the forced R\u00f6ssler equation\n(19) to describe the dynamics of an uncoupled system. We choose \u03c41\u2032 (0) = \u03c4 (0) + \u22061 , \u03c42\u2032 (0) = \u03c4 (0) + \u22062 , where \u2206i is\na measure of how off our initial guesses \u03c4i\u2032 are with respect to the true value of \u03c4 (0). We select the initial conditions\nfor xi to be constant over the time-interval [\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0], where \u03c4\u0304max = maxt \u03c4max (t), and equal to randomly chosen\n\n\f15\npoints on the R\u00f6ssler chaotic attractor. We run numerical simulations in which equations (6,13,14) are integrated for\na long time, H(xi (t)) = xi2 (t), \u0393i = [0, \u03b3i ], \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 10\u22124 /2, and \u03b31 = \u03b32 = 0.15. At each time t, we monitor\nthe estimation error < E2 > defined in Eq. (21) versus the initial mismatch \u22062 for different values of \u22061 : circles\ncorrespond to \u22061 = \u22120.9, squares correspond to \u22061 = 0, and asterisks correspond to \u22061 = 0.9. Each plotted point is\naveraged over many different realizations, i.e., over different choices of the initial conditions for x1 and x2 (constant\nover the time-interval ([\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0]) ). As can be seen, for 0 \u2264 \u22062 <\n\u223c 1.2, our strategy is able to produce good estimates\nof the unknown time-varying delay \u03c4 (t) within the time-span of our simulations (2 \u00d7 104 ). We remark that for \u22061\nin the interval \u22120.5 \u2264 \u22061 \u2264 0.5 (which represents a variation of up to \u00b150% on our initial guess with respect to the\ntrue value of \u03c4 (0) = 1), the results of our computations are very similar to the case of \u22061 = 0.\nIn the inset we investigate the effects of the initial conditions on the decentralized agreement protocol introduced in\nSec. IV. We take the individual systems to be R\u00f6ssler oscillators (19); we set \u22061 = 0.8 and plot the average estimation\n<\nerror < E2 > versus the initial mismatch \u22062 . As can be seen, for \u22120.4 <\n\u223c \u22062 \u223c 1.5, the adaptive strategy is able to\nproduce good estimates of the unknown time-varying delay \u03c4 (t) within the time-span of our simulations (2 \u00d7 104 ).\n\nVI.\n\nEFFECTS OF NOISE\n\nIn this section we consider the presence of noise in the communication channels between the two platforms.

(16), with T = 0.3, \u03b6 = 0.15, \u03c9 = 10\u22123 . We set \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 10\u22124 /2, \u03b31 = 0.6, \u03b32 = 0.5,\n\u03ba = 1. We record the average estimation error < E2 > for increasing values of the noise ratio \u03c3/\u03c3x , where \u03c3 = \u03c31 = \u03c32 and\n\u03c3x = 5.5 is the standard deviation of the time evolution of H(xs1 ). Squares correspond to \u03bd = 1.5 and diamonds to \u03bd = 3.\nCircles correspond to runs in which the same simulation is repeated for our original formulation of the adaptive strategy, Eqs.\n(6,13).

(22).\n\nIn Fig. 7 we show the results of numerical experiments involving two coupled chaotic R\u00f6ssler oscillators. We\nintegrate the set of equations (6,19,22,28), corresponding to our alternative formulation of the adaptive strategy for\nautonomous systems. We consider that the communication-delay \u03c4 slowly varies in time according to Eq. (16), with\nT = 0.3, \u03b6 = 0.15, \u03c9 = 10\u22123 (see the figure caption for the simulation parameters). We record the average estimation\nerror < E2 > for increasing values of the noise ratio \u03c3/\u03c3x , where \u03c3 = \u03c31 = \u03c32 and \u03c3x = 5.5 is the standard deviation\nof the time evolution of H(xs1 ). Squares correspond to \u03bd = 1.5 and diamonds to \u03bd = 3. Circles correspond to runs\nin which the same simulation is repeated for our original formulation of the adaptive strategy, Eqs. (6,18). As can be\nseen, for low noise (low values of \u03c3) the original adaptive strategy and the modified adaptive strategy (for both cases\nof \u03bd = 1.5 and \u03bd = 3) produce similar results. As \u03c3 is increased, the average estimation error < E2 > grows. For\nlarge enough noise \u03c3 (\u03c3 >\n\u223c 0.12\u03c3x), the modified adaptive strategy outperforms the original adaptive strategy.\nVII.\n\nA STRATEGY FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY ESTIMATING THE COMMUNICATION-DELAY AND\nTHE SIGNAL AMPLITUDE\n\nIn the previous sections we have shown that a suitable adaptive strategy based on synchronization of chaos can\nbe used to estimate an unknown communication-delay between two coupled systems and achieve synchronization\nbetween them. As a reference application, we have proposed that such a strategy could be used to estimate the\nrelative distance between two autonomously moving platforms.\nAnother aspect that we have not taken into account is that since communication occurs between two moving\nplatforms, the amplitude of the signal received at each platform could be unknown and time-varying as well. One\nviable strategy could be to try to infer the unknown amplitude from the delay. In this section, we will show that the\nadaptive strategy proposed in Secs. IV can be effectively extended to simultaneously and independently estimate the\nunknown communication-delay and the unknown amplitude, even when they evolve independent of each other and in\n\n\f19\na noisy environment. We wish to emphasize that an adaptive strategy to estimate the amplitude of the signal alone\nhas already been studied in [34, 47] and experimentally tested in [48\u201350].\nIn order to take into account the effect of the unknown time-varying amplitude of the signal received at each\nplatform, we replace equation (6) by the following,\n\n\u1e8bi (t) =F (xi (t)) + \u0393i [ri (t) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))],\n\n(29a)\n\nri (t) =A(t)H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))),\n\n(29b)\n\ni = {1, 2}, j = (3 \u2212 i), where both the amplitude A(t) and the communication-delay \u03c4 (t) are unknown and slowlyevolving in time and A\u2032i (t) is an estimate at platform i of the unknown amplitude A(t). Again, we assume that the\ntwo platforms are coupled in line of sight, so that it can be assumed that the attenuation of the signal from platform\ni to platform j is the same as that from platform j to platform i and that the communication-delay is the same in\nboth directions.\nWe now seek to obtain an adaptive strategy to simultaneously and independently estimate at each platform both\nthe unknown amplitude A(t) and the communication delay \u03c4 (t). We assume that the two chaotic systems at each\nplatform are autonomous, thus we use a decentralized agreement protocol similar to the one presented in Sec. IV.\nSimilarly to Sec. IV, we introduce at each platform i a potential,\n\n\u03a8\u0302i (t) = [A(t)H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]2 + \u03ba[A(t)\u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))]2 .\n\n(30)\n\nNote that \u03a8\u0302i \u2265 0 and \u03a8\u0302i = 0 only if x1 = x2 , \u03c4i\u2032 = \u03c4 , and A\u2032i = A. The latter follows from the observation that\nH(xi ) and H(xj ) are chaotic and rapidly evolving in time, while A(t) and A\u2032i (t) can be considered constant over the\ntimescale on which chaos evolves. Then the only way that the first term on the right hand-side of (30) can be set\nequal to zero independent of time is for A\u2032i = A, for which case A\u2032i = A can be factored out of the square brackets in\n(30). Then the condition for \u03a8\u0302i = 0 is that both the terms in the square brackets are equal zero, yielding x1 = x2 ,\nand \u03c4i\u2032 = \u03c4 (for more details, see Sec. IIA).\nThus we seek to formulate an adaptive strategy that seeks to evolve A\u2032i (t) and \u03c4i\u2032 (t) in such a way to minimize the\n\n\f20\npotential (30). To this aim, we introduce the following gradient descent relations,\n\n\u0226\u2032 i = \u2212\u03b2i\n\n\u2202 \u03a8\u0302i\n= 2\u03b2i {[A(t)H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))\n\u2202A\u2032i\n+ \u03ba[A(t)\u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))]\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))},\n\n(31a)\n\n\u2202 \u03a8\u0302i\n\u03c4 \u0307\u2032 i = \u2212\u03b1i \u2032 = \u22122\u03b1i {[A(t)H(xj (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t))) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)H(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))]A\u2032i (t)DH(xi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t)))\u1e8bi (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))\n\u2202\u03c4i\n\u2212 \u03ba[A(t)\u03c4j\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 (t)) \u2212 A\u2032i (t)\u03c4i\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4i\u2032 (t))]A\u2032i (t)},\n\n(31b)\n\nwith \u03b1i , \u03b2i > 0, i = {1, 2}.\nWe have numerically tested the adaptive strategy described by equations (29,31) with \u03c4 (t) evolving according to\nEq. (16) with T = 0.3, \u03b6 = 0.15 and A(t) evolving according to the following equation,\n\nA(t) = A + \u03b7 sin(\u03c9A t),\n\n(32)\n\nwith A = 1, \u03b7 = 0.1, \u03c9A = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . We choose each individual system to be a chaotic R\u00f6ssler oscillator (19),\nH(xi (t)) = xi1 (t) and \u0393i = [\u03b3i , 0, 0]. We set \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 10\u22124 , \u03b31 = 0.6, \u03b32 = 0.5, \u03ba = 1. The results\nof our numerical experiment are shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen, after a transient the adaptive strategy is able to\ntrack the time-evolutions of both \u03c4 (t) and A(t). Also, the time evolutions of x1 (t) and x2 (t) are synchronized (not\nshown). Note that the strategies to estimate the unknown delay and amplitude (given in Eqs. (31a) and (31b)) are\nrun simultaneously and independently of each other.\n\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur strategies described in this paper take advantage of the properties of chaotic sequences of never repeating\nin time. Another way of generating long non-repeating time-traces is to consider sequences of independent random\nnumbers.

(16), with T = 0.3, \u03b6 = 0.15; A(t) evolves\naccording to Eq. (32), with A = 1, \u03b7 = 0.1, \u03c9A = \u03c9/2 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . We set \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 10\u22124 , \u03b31 = 0.6, \u03b32 = 0.5, \u03ba = 1.\nFrom top to bottom: time evolution of \u03c4 (t) (thin black curve), \u03c41\u2032 (t) (thin grey curve), and \u03c42\u2032 (t) (thick dotted black curve); time\nevolution of the delay estimation errors, |\u03c4 (t) \u2212 \u03c41\u2032 (t)|, |\u03c4 (t) \u2212 \u03c42\u2032 (t)|; time evolution of A(t) (thin black curve), A\u20321 (t) (thin grey\ncurve), and A\u20322 (t) (thick dotted black curve); time evolution of the amplitude estimation errors, |A(t) \u2212 A\u20321 (t)|, |A(t) \u2212 A\u20322 (t)|.\nWe select the initial conditions for xi1 , xi2 , xi3 to be constant over the time-interval [\u2212\u03c4\u0304max , 0], where \u03c4\u0304max = maxt \u03c4max (t),\nand equal to randomly chosen points on the R\u00f6ssler chaotic attractor, \u03c41\u2032 (0) = 0.7, \u03c42\u2032 (0) = 0, A\u20321 (0) = 0.6, A\u20322 (0) = 1.4.\n\nn = 0, 1, ..., N , with 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1. Then if we select two s-independent random sequences as defined in (33), we can\ncompute the probability P that they are the same, P = (1 \u2212 2p(1 \u2212 p))N . It is easy to see that unless p = 0 or p = 1,\nP tends to 0 as N tends to infinity. Hence it is very unlikely to produce two random sequences that are the same.\nA way of getting around this problem, is to rely on a pseudorandom number generator, that is, a deterministic\nalgorithm for generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers. Such an\nalgorithm requires initialization by a relatively small set of initial values, called the seed. Two sequences that are\ninitialized by the same seed are identical. The seed plays the same role as the initial condition of a chaotic dynamical\nsystem and indeed a way of producing pseudorandom sequences is to use an underlying deterministic chaotic process\n[67\u201369]. In this respect, the use of a pseudorandom algorithm could represent a valid alternative to the use of a\nchaotic dynamical system for the delay-identification problem discussed in this paper.\n\n\f22\nHowever, the key-property that we present and exploit in this paper is that two chaotic dynamical systems, even\nif initialized from two different initial conditions, can be synchronized, i.e., by introducing an appropriate feedback\nmechanism, they can be maintained in a stable synchronized chaotic time-evolution [1, 7, 8]. Furthermore, it has been\nshown that even in the presence of slight non-identicality between the coupled systems and slight deviations from\nnominal conditions, a stable approximately synchronous evolution can be reached and maintained in time [12\u201317].\nThus the use of a closed-loop architecture has the following advantages:\n(i) The two systems do not need to be initialized with the same initial condition, i.e., a-priori knowledge of a seed\nis not required.\n(ii) The mechanism is robust with respect to noise and slight deviations from nominal conditions, such as slight\nnon-identicality in the individual systems, slight variations in the amplitude of the received signal, or slightly different\nenvironmental conditions.\nTo conclude, the advantage of our chaos-synchronization strategy is that it relies on a closed-loop architecture that\nallows to maintain synchronization between two distant systems even in the presence of noise and non-identicality in\nthe individual systems or mismatches in the initial conditions.\nOn the other hand, noise or small mismatches in the parameters of the individual chaotic systems being coupled\ncan be responsible for the onset of bubbling [12, 70\u201372], i.e., rare intermittent large deviations (bursts) from synchronization. Bubbling occurs when the synchronized state is stable for typical chaotic orbits but is unstable for certain\nunstable periodic orbits within the synchronized chaotic attractor. Consider for example the set of Eqs. (6,18).\nFor the case of constant \u03c4 , these equation allow an invariant set, the so-called synchronous manifold (SM), defined\nas x1 (t) = x2 (t), \u03c41\u2032 = \u03c42\u2032 = \u03c4 . Stability of the SM with respect to infinitesimal transversal perturbations can be\nquantified in terms of the maximum transverse Lyapunov exponent (MTLE) of the system. Now assume the MTLE\nis negative, implying that stability is observed for any initial condition on the attractor. However, in the presence of\neither noise, or small mismatches in the parameters of the individual systems, or even a slowly time-varying \u03c4 (t), it is\npossible that the trajectory eventually gets close to an unstable periodic orbit embedded in the attractor having an\nassociated positive MTLE. If this happens, the trajectory may be repelled away from the SM and eventually return\nclose to the SM after some time, giving rise to a burst. This phenomenon is called bubbling [70, 71]. In [72] bubbling is observed for a network of coupled dynamical systems, each of which independently implements an adaptive\nstrategy to maintain synchronization. Analogously, we expect bubbling to eventually arise (depending on the choice\nof the equation parameters), for the problem described by Eqs. (6,18), i.e., for a case in which two coupled systems\n\n\f23\nimplement an adaptive strategy to estimate a communication-delay. In particular, bubbling is likely to arise in the\ncase in which the unknown delay is time-varying, as mismatches in the delay estimate |\u03c4 \u2032 i (t) \u2212 \u03c4 (t)|, no matter how\nsmall they are, may generate it.\n\nIX.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we considered synchronization of two bidirectionally coupled chaotic systems that communicate\nwith an unknown time-varying delay. We presented a nonlinear adaptive strategy to simultaneously identify the\ntime-varying communication delay and achieve synchronization.\nTo achieve the twofold goal of synchronizing the chaotic systems and identifying the unknown delay, we proposed\nan adaptive strategy based on the minimization of an appropriately defined potential through a gradient descent\ntechnique (see also [34, 47, 48]). The proposed strategy is presented in two alternative formulations to deal with\neither non-autonomous or autonomous systems. The version for non-autonomous systems requires the presence of\ntwo perfectly synchronized internal clocks at the two platforms, while the version for autonomous systems is based\non a decentralized agreement protocol, i.e., on exchanging information on the respective delay-estimates between the\ntwo platforms.\nAs a reference application, we have considered the problem of identifying the communication-delays between two\nautonomous moving platforms. We have assumed that two identical chaotic oscillators are installed at each platform\nand that these chaotic systems seek to synchronize via a signal broadcast from one platform to the other (and\nviceversa). Moreover, we have assumed that the signal is transmitted with an unknown communication-delay that\ndepends on the distance between the platforms. Our strategy could be used to dynamically estimate at each platform\nthe distance at which the other platform is at any given time.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed approach has been illustrated by means of extensive numerical simulations,\nshowing that the adaptive strategy can be effective in synchronizing the chaotic systems and in correctly estimating\nthe time-varying communication-delay. Another advantage of our approach is that in addition to estimating the\ncommunication-delay, the adaptive strategy could be used to simultaneously identify other parameters (see e.g.,\n[30, 34, 45, 47]). For example, in Sec. VII we have shown that the adaptive strategy is effective in simultaneously and\nindependently estimating the unknown time-varying communication delay and the unknown time-varying amplitude\nof the received signal.\nTo investigate the robustness of the proposed approach, we have numerically tested the performance of our strategy\n\n\f24\nwith respect to the choice of the initial conditions. We have also investigated the effects of noise in the communication channels between the platforms and proposed an appropriately modified adaptive strategy for which a relevant\nenhancement of the performance has been observed in the presence of noise.\nOur adaptive strategy (especially in its version for nonautonomous systems) could be useful in applications as different as the identification of communication delays between moving platforms, clock synchronization, the estimation\nof propagation delays in an asynchronous code-division multiple access communication system, and the localization\nof a mobile target through a bistatic radar system. However, a main limitation to our approach seems to be that for\nsome applications (e.g., clock synchronization in a computer network) the communication delays may be asymmetrical\n(i.e., different in the two directions from i to j and from j to i). The condition of symmetrical delays, which holds\nfor line of sight communication, seems to be relevant to the formulation of our strategy that applies to autonomous\nsystems. How to extend the strategy for autonomous systems to the case of asymmetrical delays is the subject of\nongoing investigations. One viable approach would be to increase the amount/type of information that the platforms\nare allowed to exchange. As a reference for future work, we also note the importance of testing our strategy with\nsystems displaying larger complexity than the simple Van der Pol and R\u00f6ssler oscillators considered in this paper\n(e.g., systems of interest for practical applications).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFrancesco Sorrentino thanks Ed Ott, Nick Mecholsky, Bahargava Ravoori, Adam Cohen, Thomas Murphy, and Raj\nRoy for insightful discussions.
