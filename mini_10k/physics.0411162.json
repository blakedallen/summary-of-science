An analytical method\nbased on perturbation theory is used to solve the wave equation in free space without resorting\nto Fourier transforms. An exact solution is obtained in terms of successive temporal and spatial\nderivatives of a monochromatic paraxial beam. The special case of a radially polarized transverse\nmagnetic wave packet is discussed.\n\nState-of-the-art mode-locked laser oscillators can generate ultrafast pulses whose duration can be as short as\na few optical cycles [1]. Such pulses \u2013 with a finite spatiotemporal extent and thus carrying a finite quantity of\nenergy \u2013 can in principle be isolated, amplified, temporally compressed, and spatially focused to reach extreme\nfield intensities within a volume that is of the order of the\nthird power of the laser wavelength (\u03bb3 ) [1]. In this situation the commonly used paraxial approximation and\nslowly-varying-envelope approximation (SVEA) do not\napply directly and must be corrected.\nIn 1975, Lax et al. proposed a method to express exact\nsolutions of Maxwell's equations in terms of an infinite series of corrections applied to a paraxial electric field [2].\nSo far, this approach has led numerous studies dealing\nwith non-paraxial optics. Unfortunately, as it is also the\ncase for the electromagnetic beam theory developed by\nDavies [3], the so-called \"method of Lax\" only applies to\nmonochromatic beams, or CW laser signals. With the\noutstanding developments in femtosecond and attosecond technologies, more appropriate tools are required to\ndescribe the propagation of non-paraxial ultrashort light\npulses, sometimes called light bullets. Recently, Lu et\nal. [4] have proposed a method to describe the free-space\npropagation of vectorial non-paraxial ultrashort pulsed\nbeams in the frequency domain. In this letter, we present\nan alternative approach to this problem entirely in the\ntime domain, i.e. without using Fourier transforms.\nThe spatiotemporal propagation of an electromagnetic\nwave packet is governed by Maxwell's equations. Solving\nthese equations in free space proceeds in three steps :\n1. the transverse electric field vector E\u22a5 is found from\nthe wave equation, 2. the longitudinal electric field Ez\nis obtained from the divergence equation (\u2207 * E = 0),\nand 3. the magnetic flux vector B is calculated from the\ndifferential form of Faraday's law (\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212\u2202t B) or\nthe differential form of Amp\u00e8re's law (\u2207 \u00d7 B = c\u22122 \u2202t E),\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuo, and \u2202 t \u2261 \u2202/\u2202t.\nIn the case of a paraxial wave packet whose duration\nis much longer than the optical period, this sequence of\noperations is performed with ease. We now describe each\nof these three steps in detail beyond the range of validity\nof the paraxial approximation and of the SVEA.\nIn free space, the vectorial wave equation for the trans-\n\nverse electric field vector E\u22a5 \u2013 perpendicular to the timeaveraged Poynting vector \u2013 is given by the following wave\nequation [5]:\n\u22072 E\u22a5 \u2212\n\n1 2\n\u2202 E\u22a5 = 0.\nc2 t\n\n(1)\n\nThe electric field vector is defined as follows in phasor\nnotation (see also Refs. 1 and 6) :\nE = E\u22a5 + Ez az ,\nh\ni\n= Re \u1ebc exp [j(\u03c90 t \u2212 k0 z)] ,\n\u0011\ni\nh\u0010\n= Re \u1ebc\u22a5 + \u1ebcz az exp [j(\u03c90 t \u2212 k0 z)] ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u1ebc\u22a5 is the complex envelope of the transverse electric field vector, \u1ebcz is the complex envelope of the longitudinal electric field, az is a longitudinal\u221aunit vector oriented along the pulse propagation, j = \u22121 ; \u03c90 = k0 c,\nk0 = 2\u03c0\u03bb0 , and \u03bb0 are the central angular frequency, the\ncentral wave number, and the central wavelength of the\nwave packet spectrum, respectively. Combining Eqs. (1)\nand (2), one obtains the following equation for the complex envelope of the field :\n\u03c90\n1\n\u2202 t \u1ebc\u22a5 + \u2202 z2 \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 2 \u2202 t2 \u1ebc\u22a5 = 0,\nc2\nc\n(3)\nwhere \u2207\u22a5 is a differential operator acting in the transverse plane.\nThe use of the retarded time t\u2032 = t \u2212 z/c instead of\nthe (normal) time t is sometimes preferred when dealing\nwith the propagation of electromagnetic signals of finite\nspatiotemporal extent [5]. More specifically, it separates\nthe transverse envelope (diffraction) from the temporal\nenvelope (pulse shape). After some manipulations, the\nresult given at Eq. (3) can be expressed in terms of the\nretarded variables t\u2032 = t \u2212 z/c and z \u2032 = z as follows :\n\u22072\u22a5 \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 2jk0 \u2202 z \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 2j\n\n\u22072\u22a5 \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 2jk0 \u2202 z\u2032 \u1ebc\u22a5 + \u2202 z2\u2032 \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212\n\n2\n\u2202 z\u2032 \u2202 t\u2032 \u1ebc\u22a5 = 0. (4)\nc\n\nAlternatively, Eq. (4) can be written in a more compact\nform that reads :\n\u22072\u22a5 \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 2jk0 \u2202 z\u2032 [ 1 \u2212 \u0398 ] \u1ebc\u22a5 = 0,\n\n(5)\n\n\f2\n\u0001\nwith \u0398 = j \u03c90\u22121 \u2202 t\u2032 \u2212 (2k0 )\u22121 \u2202 z\u2032 . For paraxial and\nquasi-monochromatic optical beams, the term \u0398\u1ebc\u22a5 is\nvanishingly\nto the complex field \u1ebc\u22a5 iti\nh small compared\nself, i.e. \u1ebc\u22a5 \u2212 \u0398\u1ebc\u22a5 \u2243 \u1ebc\u22a5 . In that case, Eq. (5) leads\n\nto the paraxial wave equation [7]. On the other hand,\nwhen the transverse (or longitudinal) dimension of the\nwave packet is of the order of the wavelength, the term\n\u0398\u1ebc\u22a5 can no longer be neglected. However, the modulus\nof this contribution, i.e. |\u0398\u1ebc\u22a5 |, remains small even for\nstrongly focused single-cycle light pulses [2, 6, 8, 9]. As\na consequence, we can consider Eq. (5) to be a perturbed\nparaxial wave equation.\nWe observe that the partial differential operator \u0398\ncannot be reduced to a simpler operator, proportional\nonly to spatial or temporal derivatives, i.e. \u0398 \u221d \u2202 zn or\n\u0398 \u221d \u2202 tn . This fact clearly indicates that spatial and\ntemporal effects cannot be decoupled. Consequently, a\nsolution of Eq. (5) is found by expanding the transverse\nelectric field vector \u1ebc\u22a5 as a power series of \u0398. In a compact notation it reads :\n\u1ebc\u22a5 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n)\n\n\u0398n \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 .\n\n(6)\n\nz \u2032 to yield :\n\u0013m \u0010\n\u0012\n\u221e\n\u0011\n\u2212j X m 1\n1\n\u2207\u22a5 * \u1ebc\u22a5 .\nj\n\u2202 t\u2032 \u2212 \u2202 z\u2032\nk0 m=0\n\u03c90\nk0\n(10)\nA general equation giving the magnetic flux vector B\nof an arbitrary ultrashort wave packet can be deduced\nfrom Maxwell's equations but cannot always be reduced\nto a simple expression, as it is the case for monochromatic transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves (see Eq.\n(7.11) of Ref. 5). However, for a given distribution and\npolarization of the transverse electric field vector corresponds a spatiotemporal arrangement of the fields that is\nunique and guarantees the stability of the wave packet.\nAs an example, let us consider the case of a TM0l wave\npacket whose transverse electric field is radially polarized, i.e. E\u22a5 = Er ar and E\u03b8 = 0, where r and \u03b8 are polar\ncoordinates in the plane perpendicular the propagation\naxis (the z-axis), and l = 1, 2, 3, . . . The intensity profile\nof this particular family of beams is characterized by l\nconcentric and angularly symmetric (\u2202\u03b8 E\u22a5 = 0) bright\nrings [7]. From Amp\u00e8re's law (\u2207 \u00d7 B = c\u22122 \u2202t E), we obtain the two following equations (Br = 0 and Bz = 0) :\n\u1ebcz =\n\nn=0\n\nBy equating terms with the same power of \u0398 in Eq. (5),\nthe two following equations are then found :\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n= 0, (7a)\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n= 0, (7b)\n\n\u22072\u22a5 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 \u2212 2jk0 \u2202 z\u2032 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n\u22072\u22a5 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 \u2212 2jk0 \u2202 z\u2032 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 + 2jk0 \u2202 z\u2032 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5\n\nsolving the perturbed paraxial wave equation in such a\nway that the nth contribution is obtained recursively\nfrom the order (n \u2212 1), acting like a source term in the\n(n<0)\nparaxial wave equation (\u03a8\u0303\u22a5\n= 0).\nA solution of the recursion relation given at Eq. (7b)\nis written as follows (see Porras[8]) :\n\u0012 \u2032n\n\u0013\nz\n(n)\n(0)\nn\u22121\n\u03a8\u0303\u22a5 = \u2202 z\u2032\n\u2202 z\u2032 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 ,\n(8a)\nn!\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn \u2212 1 z \u2032m m (0)\n\u2202 \u2032 \u03a8\u0303 ,\n(8b)\n=\nm \u2212 1 m! z \u22a5\nm=1\n(n)\n\nthus giving \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 in terms of successive derivatives of\n(0)\nthe zero-order field \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 , a solution of the paraxial wave\nequation. Recalling Eq. (6), the envelope of the transverse electric field vector reads :\n\u0013n\n\u0012 \u2032n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nX\nz\n1\n1\n(0)\n\u2202 zn\u22121\njn\n\u2202 t\u2032 \u2212\n\u2202 z\u2032\n\u2202 z\u2032 \u03a8\u0303\u22a5 .\n\u1ebc\u22a5 =\n\u2032\n\u03c90\n2k0\nn!\nn=0\n(9)\nFor any given transverse electric field vector E\u22a5 , the\nlongitudinal electric field Ez can be obtained from the divergence equation. With the use of the complex notation\ndefined at Eq. (2), \u2207*E = 0 can be formally inverted [10]\nand expressed in terms of the retarded variables t\u2032 and\n\nr\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212 \u2202 z B\u03b8 = c\u22122 \u2202 t Er ,\n\u2202 r (rB\u03b8 ) = c\u22122 \u2202 t Ez .\n\n(11a)\n(11b)\n\nIf we combine Eqs. (11a) and (11b) together, we obtain\nthe divergence equation that we solved earlier at Eq. (10).\nThus, the solution of Eq. (11a) assures that Eq. (11b)\nis also respected. If we express the fields in complex\nnotation (and then in terms of the retarded variables),\nthe formal inversion of Eq. (11a) yields :\n\u0013p\n\u0012\n\u221e\n1 X p 1\n1\nB\u0303\u03b8 =\n\u2202 t\u2032 \u2212 \u2202 z\u2032 (1 \u2212 j/\u03c90 \u2202 t\u2032 ) \u1ebcr .\nj\nc p=0\n\u03c90\nk0\n(12)\nIn the past, many investigations have been devoted to\nthe study of the paraxial wave equation and its solutions\n(see for example Ref. 11). More specifically, we make\nreference to the wide family of the Gauss-Hermite and\nGauss-Laguerre beam modes, considered to be a good\nrepresentation of the transverse electromagnetic modes\nof optical resonators [7, 12]. According to the formalism we propose, these solutions, or any solution obtained\nunder the paraxial beam optics theory, can be extended\nto the case of tightly focused (non-paraxial) ultrashort\n(few-cycle) wave packets using the general formulation\nwe developed. We emphasize the fact that we obtained\nall the spatiotemporal corrections in the time-domain, alternatively to the Fourier transform approach [4]. However, the method described here has the feature that it\ndisplays directly the corrections of the SVEA on the fourdimensional structure of the wave packet, as needed to\ncorrectly predict ultrafast interactions with matter. For\ninstance, dispersion and nonlinear optical effects could\nbe embedded in this formalism [6].\n\n\f3\nThis letter should be considered as an extension \u2013 a\nvectorial and non-paraxial generalization \u2013 of a previous work published by Porras [8]. In fact, it is possible to show that Eq. (9) simplifies to the equation for\nparaxial ultrashort pulsed beams when the spatial variations of the field due to diffraction are negligible compared to the variations of the temporal envelope, i.e.\nwhen \u0398 \u2243 j\u03c90\u22121 \u2202 t\u2032 (see Eq. (8) of Ref. 8). Besides, it\nhas been demonstrated that the perturbation method we\nused leads to the same results that are obtained from\nintegral methods [8]. We thus observe that the fields\ngiven at Eqs. (9) and (10) are equivalent to the Eqs. (25)\nand (28) of the paper of Lu et al. [4].\nThe irreducibility of the expansion parameter \u0398 indicates that in free space, the spatial and temporal envelopes of a non-paraxial ultrashort wave packet are nonseparable. This coupling ensures the wave packet's stability under tight focusing and reveals itself as a reorganization of the structure of the wave packet, noticeable as\nmodifications of the carrier wave and the spatiotemporal\nenvelope [8].\nFor a gaussian beam (with a gaussian pulse\nshape), the spatial and temporal contributions, i.e.\n(2k0 )\u2212n \u2202 zn\u2032 \u1ebc\u22a5 and \u03c90\u2212n \u2202 tn\u2032 \u1ebc\u22a5 , are respectively proportional to (2k0 zR )\u2212n = (k0 r0 )\u22122n and (\u03c90 \u2206t)\u2212n , where\nzR = k0 r02 /2 is the Rayleigh distance, r0 is the wave\npacket transverse extent at focus (beam waist), and \u2206t\nis the pulse duration. The expansion of \u0398n yields also\n\ncrossed-terms with various powers of k0 r0 and \u03c90 \u2206t.\nHowever, for a single-cycle pulse (\u2206t = 2\u03c0/\u03c90 ) focused\ndown to one wavelength (r0 = 2\u03c0/k0 ), the most important contribution comes from the temporal envelope\nand decreases as (2\u03c0)\u2212n . Consequently, it is observed\nthat a truncated series (n = 0, 1, 2) reproduces the exact\nfield with a good accuracy (see Porras [8]). Nonetheless,\nfor slightly focused and long pulses (r0 >> 2\u03c0/k0 and\n\u2206t >> 2\u03c0/\u03c90 ), the formalism reduces to the expressions\nfor paraxial and monochromatic beams [2, 11].\nThe full vectorial treatment we have presented here\nalso leads to an exact evaluation of the associated longitudinal electric and magnetic fields. These field components are not usually dealt with in optics ; however, they\nmust be taken into consideration for the study of relativistic effects in laser-matter interactions and for the investigation of electron acceleration in intense laser fields.\n\n[1] T.
