We propose that the buildup of the central disks\nand bulges of massive galaxies at z~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of\ngas-rich 'proto'-disks. High redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This\nturbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid\n'cold' accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result dynamical\nfriction and viscous processes proceed on a time scale of <1 Gyr, at least an order of\nmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and\nstars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges,\neven without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star\nformation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short time scales\nof the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z~2.\n\nKeywords: cosmology: observations --- galaxies: evolution --- galaxies: highredshift --- infrared: galaxies\n\n2\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\nDeep surveys have become efficient in detecting z~1.5-3.5 star-forming galaxy\n\npopulations near the peak of the cosmic star formation and QSO activity (e.g. Steidel\net al. 1996, 2004, Franx et al. 2003, Daddi et al. 2004b). Large samples are now\navailable, based on their rest-frame UV magnitude/color properties (the so-called\n'BX/BM' criterion: Adelberger et al. 2004, Steidel et al. 2004), or on rest-frame\noptical magnitude/color properties ('star-forming', or 's'-BzKs: Daddi et al. 2004a,b,\nDRGs: Franx et al. 2003). These selection criteria sample fairly luminous (L~1011-12.5\nL\u007f) galaxies with star formation rates of 10-300 M\u007f/yr, with a range of ages (10 Myrs\n- 3 Gyrs) and stellar masses (M*~109-11.5 M\u001b) (Shapley et al. 2005, F\u00f6rster Schreiber\net al. 2004, Erb et al. 2006b,c, Daddi et al. 2004a,b). These galaxies contribute a large\nfraction of the cosmic star formation activity and stellar mass density at z~2 (Reddy et\nal. 2005, Rudnick et al. 2005, Grazian et al. 2007).\nOpen issues are how these high-z galaxies formed their stars, when and how the\nfirst disks and bulges formed and how their subsequent evolution was related to each\nother. Was the star formation history, and especially the formation of bulges driven by\nshort, intense bursts following major mergers (mass ratios <3:1)? Or was this\nevolution dominated by rapid but more continuous 'cold' accretion of gas from the\ndark matter halos, including large mass ratio (\u226510:1) gas rich minor mergers, as\nproposed by Semelin & Combes (2002), Birnboim & Dekel (2003) and Kere\u0161 et al.\n(2005)? Motivated by the cold dark matter paradigm of structure formation, the\n(major) merger interpretation has been favored by many for some time, especially for\nbulge formation. Recent observations and simulations have lent support for the 'rapid\naccretion', or 'cold flow' scenario, at least for the formation of high-z disks.\n\n3\n\n\fOptically/UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z~0.5-2.5 exhibit a fairly tight\nrelationship between stellar mass and star formation rate, arguing against a significant\ncontribution from and time spent in short luminous bursts, but rather favoring a high\nduty cycle of steady star formation, at least for these populations (Noeske et al. 2007,\nElbaz et al. 2007, Daddi et al. 2007). Imaging studies have revealed the presence of a\nnumber high-z disk galaxies (e.g. Labb\u00e9 et al. 2003, Stockton et al. 2008). The first\nspatially resolved studies of the ionized gas kinematics in optically/UV-selected, z~2\nstar-forming galaxies have yielded a surprisingly high abundance of large rotating\ndisks among the more massive (Mdyn~1011 M\u001b) and restframe optical bright (Ks\u226420)\nsystems. In this sub-sample only a smaller fraction (~1/3) are obvious major mergers\n(Shapiro et al. 2008, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, Genzel et al. 2006, Wright et al,\n2007, Law et al. 2007, Cresci et al. 2008). In contrast to these UV/optically selected\ngalaxies, the very luminous submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z~1-3 appear to mostly\nbe major mergers in various stages of evolution (Tacconi et al. 2006, 2008, Swinbank\net al. 2006). The most recent generation of cosmological galaxy evolution\nsimulations, based on dark matter merger tree simulations, find that smooth accretion\nof gas and/or minor mergers dominate high-z star formation, while the overall mass\nassembly of galaxies, and especially the most massive ones, is dominated by mergers\n(Bower et al. 2006, Kitzbichler & White 2007, Naab et al. 2007, Guo & White 2008,\nDav\u00e9 2008, Genel et al. 2008). This conclusion seems to hold for simulations of the\nbaryonic physics based on semi-analytic recipes, as well as for hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Taken together, these recent observational and theoretical results are\nbeginning to form a well formulated framework for the formation of disks that needs\nnow to be tested by detailed 'in situ' observations. Such measurements also need to\nexplore the evolution of the first disks, as well as the formation bulges.\n\n4\n\n\fIn this paper we present and analyze high-quality SINFONI/VLT integral field\n(IFU) spectroscopy (Eisenhauer et al. 2003, Bonnet et al. 2004) of 8 representative\nUV/optically selected (BX/s-BzK) z~2 star forming galaxies. The data for two of\nthese galaxies are discussed here for the first time. For these galaxies we employed\nlaser guide star (LGSF) adaptive optics (AO) to improve the angular resolution. The\ndata for the other 6 galaxies are discussed in other publications of our team (F\u00f6rster\nSchreiber et al. 2006, 2008a, Genzel et al. 2006, Cresci et al. 2008) and we present\nhere a new, detailed analysis. We show that these data deliver interesting new\nconstraints on the issues of disk evolution, bulge formation and star formation\nprocesses. We adopt a \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9m=0.27, \u03a9b=0.046 and H0=70\nkm/s/Mpc and a Chabrier (2003) initial stellar mass function.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Analysis\n\n2.1 Data\nAs part of the SINS survey of high-z galaxy kinematics we observed the H\u03b1 and\n[OIII] lines and the rest-frame R-band continuum in the UV selected BX galaxy\nQ2346-BX482 (z=2.26, Erb et al. 2006b,c, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006), as well as\nthe H\u03b1 line and restframe R-band continuum in the optically selected s-BzK galaxy\nBzK6004-3482 (henceforth BzK6004, z=2.39, Kong et al. 2006). For a more detailed\ndescription of the SINS/SINFONI sample we refer to F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2008a).\nBriefly, the SINS-BzK targets are drawn directly from the list of optically selected\nK\u226420 s-BzK galaxies (in the case of the Deep 3a field: Kong et al. 2006). The SINSBX/BM sample is a fair representation of the larger Erb et al. (2006a) H\u03b1 sample in\nterms of source sizes and dynamical masses. However, our additional selection\n5\n\n\fcriteria emphasize somewhat brighter (<F(H\u03b1)> 10-16 compared to 6x10-17 erg/s/cm2)\nand somewhat broader line width (<vc>~175, \u00b168 km/s sample dispersion) systems\nthan the average galaxy in the larger sample of Erb et al. (2006b,c, <vc>~140). For\nBX482 and BzK6004 we used SINFONI (Eisenhauer et al. 2003, Bonnet et al. 2004)\non UT4 at the ESO VLT in the seeing-limited and LGSF AO modes (Rabien et al.\n2003, Bonaccini Calia et al. 2006). In addition we re-analyzed the seeing-limited Kdata in the three BX galaxies Q2343-BX389 (z=2.174), Q2343-BX610 (z=2.211) and\nSSA22-MD41 (z=2.172) (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, Cresci et al. 2008). Table 1\ngives the observing log and lists the FWHM angular resolutions of these data. The\nFWHM spectral resolution of all K-data cubes is about 80 km/s. For part of our\nanalysis we also refer to results of three additional SINS z~2 BX/s-BzK galaxies for\nwhich we have LGSF and natural guide star (NGS) AO SINFONI observations with\nresolutions of 0.2\". These galaxies are Q1623-BX502 (z=2.16, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2006), BzK15504 (z=2.38, Genzel et al. 2006) and ZC782941 (z=2.18, SINS and\nCOSMOS teams in prep.). For a description of our general data reduction methods\nwe refer to Schreiber et al. (2004) and F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2006). With the final\ndata cubes in hand, we smoothed the data by two spatial pixels and then fitted\nGaussian line profiles to each pixel. To blank out non-meaningful or low signal-tonoise regions, we multiplied the resulting velocity and velocity dispersion maps with\na mask constructed from the total H\u03b1 line intensity distribution.\n\nThe five main sources we discuss in this paper were selected from the SINS\nsurvey of z~1.5-3 star forming galaxies (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008a) on two\ncriteria. First they are among those galaxies for which quantitative kinemetry of their\nvelocity fields shows that they are very likely rotating disks and are not undergoing\n\n6\n\n\fmajor mergers (Shapiro et al. 2008). Second among the SINS rotating disks these five\ngalaxies are those with the highest quality data and are the best spatially resolved\nsystems (FWHM major axis diameter ~ 3 to 7.5 times the FWHM instrumental\nresolution). This makes possible a quantitative and fairly robust analysis of the\ndynamics, including for the first time the determination of the ratio of the dynamical\nmass in the central few kpc to the total dynamical mass. As a result the galaxies we\nhave chosen belong to the largest (30 percentile) and most massive (50 percentile)\nmembers of the SINS sample but otherwise are representative of other massive (~1011\nM\u001b) star-forming galaxies at z~2.\n\nOf the three additional SINS galaxies discussed in this paper, BzK15504 and\nZC782941 are similar to the other five large BX/s-BzK galaxies discussed above, in\nterms of size, mass and dynamical properties. In contrast BX502 is a representative of\nthe fairly common class of compact, young and somewhat lower mass members\namong the BX population in the Erb et al. (2006b,c) sample, a number of which\nappear to be 'dispersion dominated', where the random velocity dispersion is\ncomparable to any large scale rotational component (Law et al. 2007). For these three\nadditional galaxies we also resolve the disk dynamics but the data are unsuitable for a\nbulge analysis. The central velocity field of BzK15504 shows an outflow potentially\ntriggered by an AGN, The outer velocity field of ZC782941 is disturbed by an\nongoing minor merger. BX502 is too compact for a detailed dynamical analysis.\n\n2.2 Modeling\nWe fit the H\u03b1 velocity fields of all galaxies with simple rotating disk models\n(F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, Cresci et al. 2008). These disk models compute data\n\n7\n\n\fcubes from input structural parameters. A specific model requires specifying one or\nseveral mass/light components, parameterized by azimuthally symmetric analytic\nfunctions (e.g. exponential disks, Gaussians, rings etc.), the total dynamical mass\nMdyn, z-scale height, inclination, position angle of major axis on the sky and a\ncomponent of constant velocity dispersion throughout the disk (\u03c301). The model data\nare then convolved with the angular and spectral resolution profiles and sampled at\nthe observed pixel scales. The total dynamical mass and mass distributions then fully\ndefine the velocity field, which is computed assuming spherical symmetry. Given the\nlarge z-scale heights hz inferred for the z~2 galaxies (see below) this approximation\nholds at the 10-15% level of velocity estimation (Binney & Tremaine 2008, chapter\n2). This is sufficient for our modeling. A given z-scale height results in an additional\nz-velocity dispersion \u03c302. In the approximation of a very large and very thin disk this\nis given by\n\u239b\u03c3 \u239e\nhz\n= 0.5 \u239c 02 \u239f\nR\n\u239d vd \u23a0\n\n2\n\n(1a),\n\nwhere vd( R ) is the rotation velocity at radius R (Binney & Tremaine 2008, eq.\n4.302c). For a thick or a compact disk equation (1) needs to be replaced by\nh z \u03c3 02\n=\nR\nvd\n\n(1b).\n\nThe total z-velocity dispersion in our models then is \u03c3 0 = \u03c3 012 + \u03c3 022 .\n\nTo determine the model parameters that best describe each galaxy, we constructed\na first order input model with parameters for the light/mass distribution and\ninclination as estimated from PSF-corrected Gaussian major and minor axis FWHM\nsizes of the integrated H\u03b1 emission. We then refined these models iteratively to match\n\n8\n\n\fthe velocity and velocity dispersion maps for each galaxy. We determined the best\nfitting galaxy parameters from \u03c72-minimization between our disk model outputs and\nthe two-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion maps. In the case of BX482 we\nincluded in this \u03c72-miminization the extinction corrected, two-dimensional H\u03b1 light\ndistribution in the optimization (see below). For the other galaxies the H\u03b1 brightness\ndistribution is too asymmetric and clumpy as to be useable as a detailed constraint\nbeyond that obtained from the initial major axis size and aspect ratio above. While the\ndisk orientation, inclination and kinematic parameters (rotation curve, velocity\ndispersion distribution) can be well determined from the data sets, the details of the\nstructural parameters (disk scale length, ring widths, size of the central mass\nconcentration etc.) are necessarily less well and not uniquely constrained.\n\nThe key new parameter we are able to extract from the high quality data discussed\nin this paper (as compared to the work of F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006 and Cresci et\nal. 2008) is a 'mass concentration parameter', that is the ratio of the dynamical mass\nin the center (we chose R \u2264 0.4\"~3.3 kpc) to that in the overall observed disk to R \u2264\n1.2\" (~10 kpc). This ratio can be interpreted as the mass in a central bulge or central\ndisk to the overall disk mass. To derive this mass concentration parameter we\nrepeated the velocity field \u03c72-miminization along a major axis cut with the\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\") ratio as the only free variable, once the best fitting values of\ninclination, positional angle, total mass and structural parameters (ring radius and\nwidth, or disk scale length) were determined from the 2d \u03c72-miminization. Along this\naxis the rotation velocity and velocity dispersion are maximally sensitive to the\nrotation curve, and thus to the mass distribution (van der Kruit & Allen 1978). This is\nespecially true for the central regions, which are poorly resolved by our data. Our\n\n9\n\n\fobservations only provide a modest number of independent 2d resolution elements\nacross the observed galaxies. In this regime the 2d velocity data off the major axis\nmainly serve to constrain the overall orientation of the galaxy (inclination and major\naxis position angle). The regions near the minor axis also are sensitive to non-circular\nmotions since the rotation component is minimized there (Figure 1 of van der Kruit &\nAllen 1978). For the determination of the mass concentration parameter\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\") inclination and position angle drop out and thus to first order\ndo not enter the error budget. As a result we can fit for this single parameter from the\nmajor axis data once the overall disk geometry is known.\n\nFor each galaxy we considered two types of models. One is an exponential disk\nmodel of constant dynamical mass to H\u03b1 light ratio and radial scale length Rd. The\nother is a combination of a Gaussian ring (at radius Rr and FWHM width 2\u0394R), plus a\ncentral mass (again a Gaussian at R=0 and \u0394R=0.15-0.2\"). Such a ring can also\ngenerically describe a flat surface brightness disk when Rr~\u0394R.\n\nWith some exceptions described below the velocity and velocity dispersion fields\nin the five galaxies discussed here are remarkably well matched by simple disk\nmodels. The maximum residuals from the best-fit velocity fields range between 10\nand 50 km/s~0.05-0.2 vd(max). The most serious limitation of our modeling comes\nfrom the clumpiness and asymmetry of the H\u03b1 brightness distributions in most of the\nprogram galaxies, which limits the detail that can be derived on the matter\ndistribution.\n\n10\n\n\f3. Results\nFigures 1 through 8 summarize the data, models and data-model residuals for the\nfive main SINS z~2 star-forming galaxies we are discussing in this paper. We also\nshow comparisons between the integrated H\u03b1 line maps and the broad-band stellar\ncontinuum maps, extracted either from the SINFONI cubes, or from the HST\nNICMOS/NIC2 imaging through the F160W filter (hereafter: \"H160', F\u00f6rster\nSchreiber et al. 2008b). Tables 2 and 3 summarize the derived physical properties of\nthese five galaxies, and in particular the mass concentration parameter\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\") introduced in the last section. In addition to the basic\nstructural and dynamical parameters deduced from our modeling, we also list\nextinction corrected star formation rates inferred from H\u03b1 (based on the Calzetti 2001\nrecipes), stellar masses inferred from modeling of the rest-frame UV/optical spectral\nenergy distribution (see F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008a for details) and gas masses\nestimated from the star formation rates and the universal Kennicutt-Schmidt star\nformation. For the latter we adopt the gas mass-star formation relation proposed by\nBouch\u00e9 et al. (2007). Finally we also list in Table 3 the [NII]/H\u03b1 flux ratio, rest-frame\nequivalent width of H\u03b1 and star formation surface densities.\n\nIn the next sections we first discuss the individual galaxies, starting with the new\nlaser guide star AO observations. None of these five galaxies show evidence for an\nongoing or recent major merger. Their star formation rates nevertheless are quite high.\nFrom Table 2 one sees that the time required to exhaust the present gas in these\ngalaxies at the present star formation rate is ~2 x108 years, an order of magnitude\n\n11\n\n\fsmaller than the interval of cosmic times (~2 Gyr) over which these galaxies are\nselected (1.4<z<2.5), or the stellar ages determined from the SED modeling (see\nhowever the caveats in 4.7). Because of the quoted tight correlation of star formation\nrate with stellar mass (Daddi et al. 2007), the high star formation rates typical of these\nz~2 galaxies must clearly be sustained for most of this time interval. Given that the\nconsumption time is a factor ~10 less, this suggests that star formation in our study\ngalaxies is sustained by continuous inflow of cold gas in a quasi-steady-state regime,\nin good agreement with the conclusions of Erb (2008).\n\n3.1 Q2343-BX482\nIn our initial seeing-limited SINFONI H\u03b1 data (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006) this\ngalaxy appeared to be 'tadpole'-shaped with a bright emission spot to the south-east\nand a conical open emission region to the north-west. Our higher resolution LGSF\ndata as well as the NIC2 H160 image of F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2008b) shown in\nFigure 1 now reveal that the H\u03b1 and rest frame V-band continuum emission forms a\ncomplete, clumpy ring of radius ~0.8\", with a strong east-west asymmetry in the\nbrightness distribution, but with a coherent kinematic structure. The additional seeing\nlimited data of the 5007 \u00c5 [OIII] line exhibit an even stronger intensity asymmetry\nbut the same kinematics. As a result the [OIII]/H\u03b1 flux ratio from the seeing limited\nmode for comparable resolution exhibits a smooth east-north-east to west-south-west\ngradient (Figure 1 top right panel). There is either a large scale gradient in\nexcitation/abundance or in extinction. An abundance gradient is not very likely since\nthe [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio is constant across the source, to within the measurement\nuncertainties. If there is an east-west extinction gradient, the intrinsic H\u03b1 distribution\nhas to be more symmetric. The extinction gradient could be caused by diffuse\n12\n\n\fforeground dust, or by dust partially mixed in with the H\u03b1 emission in the ring. We\nhave used the observed [OIII]/H\u03b1 gradient to correct for the differential extinction\nacross the source. Adopting an LMC/SMC extinction curve and a 'foreground screen'\nextinction model 2 , the south-east to north-west asymmetry in the H\u03b1 brightness\ndistribution disappears and in fact is reversed (top left panel of the major axis cut in\nFigure 3). The extinction corrected two-dimensional brightness distribution is\nremarkably well matched by a symmetric inclined ring (inclination 65\u00b170, position\nangle -65\u00b150 (positive= east of north)). The maximum differential extinction across\nthe entire galaxy is \u0394AV~1.9. The average residual (data-model) brightness across the\ngalaxy is 9 % of the maximum surface brightness, with a few regions deviating by up\nto 40%.\nThe velocity and velocity dispersion data in Figures 2 & 3 are well fit either by a\nsuperposition of a fairly narrow (2\u0394R~0.3\") ring at radius Rr=0.85\"\u00b10.1\", plus a\ncentral mass (a bulge or central disk), or by an exponential disk model (upper right\ninset in Figure 3). The former model is obviously motivated by the morphology of the\nH\u03b1 emission, while latter is the canonical distribution found in low-z disk galaxies.\nFor both models the maximum intrinsic rotation velocity is vd=235\u00b140 km/s (middle\nright panel of Fig.3). Average residuals in the velocity and velocity dispersion maps\nover most of the galaxy are <10 km/s, with larger deviations in velocity (up to 100\nkm/s) along the northern edge of the galaxy (top right panel of Figure 2). To match\nthe steep slope of the major axis rotation curve and also the peak of velocity\ndispersion near the kinematic center (bottom left panel of Figure 3), the ring model\n\n2\n\nin a screen extinction model the line intensity at wavelength \u03bb depends on dust opacity \u03c4\u03bb at \u03bb as exp(\u03c4\u03bb). For an LMC/SMC extinction curve appropriate for the sub-solar abundance implied by the BX482\n[NII]/H\u03b1 line ratio \u03b4=\u03c4[\u039f\u0399\u0399\u0399]/ \u03c4\u0397\u03b1 \u223c1.5 (Calzetti 2001). The differential extinction correction to the H\u03b1\ndata then scales as {F([OIII])/F(H\u03b1))}-\u03b2, with \u03b2=(\u03b4-1)-1~2.\n13\n\n\frequires an additional central mass, either a bulge and/or a concentrated inner disk\n(HWHM\u223c0.3\"). The best fitting mass of the central component within 0.4\" is 2.9\u00b10.3\nx1010 M\u001b, implying a mass concentration parameter\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\")=0.205\u00b10.03. With this ring (+bulge) input model the major\naxis H\u03b1 intensity, velocity and velocity dispersion data are fit with \u03c7r2~1. A ring\nmodel without a central mass component can be excluded with high significance. An\nexponential disk model does as well as the ring (+bulge) model in fitting the\ndynamical data and implies approximately the same mass concentration parameter as\nthe ring (+bulge) model (~0.16, bottom right inset of Figure 3). However, the\nexponential disk model obviously fails to match the ring morphology of the H\u03b1 (and\nH-band continuum) maps in Figure 1. If the intensity of H\u03b1 traces the mass\ndistribution a constant mass to light ratio, an exponential disk model is excluded with\nhigh significance in the fitting.\n\nThe obvious question is whether the ring morphology of the H\u03b1 emission may just\ntrace the regions of currently active star formation and not the overall mass, and may\nthus just represent 'frosting on the cake'. The middle left panel of Figure 3 shows that\nthe projected rotation velocity rises locally upward at R\u2264Rr and then appears to fall at\nR>Rr on the eastward side. This is consistent with our assumption that the ring traces\nthe dynamical mass. More importantly the NIC2 image (rest frame ~V-band) shows\nthat the visible stellar distribution is also dominated by the ring structure (middle inset\nof Figure 1, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al, 2008b). The integrated HAB-band magnitude of\nBX482 is 22.4 (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b). Adopting a constant star formation\nmodel with Z=0.4 Z\u001b tracks, a Kroupa/Chabrier IMF and a Calzetti (2001) extinction\nmodel with AV~1.5-2, this magnitude implies a mass of live stars of 4-9x1010 M\u001b for\n\n14\n\n\fa plausible age range of 0.3-1 Gyrs. Adding this stellar mass and the gas mass\nestimated from the H\u03b1-based star formation rate and a Kennicutt-Schmidt recipe\n(3x1010 M\u001b, Table 2) results in a baryonic mass of 7-12x1010 M\u001b associated with the\nvisible ring (+bulge) structure. Allowing for a 20-40% dark matter contribution to the\ndynamical mass within ~10-15 kpc (section 4 below) then yields a sum of dark matter\nand baryonic matter of 10-18x1010 M\u001b. Our dynamical modeling yields a total\ndynamical mass of 14.3\u00b12x1010 M\u001b, leaving little or no space for any additional\nunderlying older stellar distribution that is not traced by our data. We conclude that\nthe baryonic matter distribution of BX482 is most likely a ring, plus a small\nbulge/central disk.\n\nThere are significant deviations of the data from the best fitting model. All\nrotating ring/disk models exhibit significant residuals in the northern part of the ring\n(upper right panel in Figure 2), perhaps indicating that there is an addition large scale,\nradial velocity component near the minor axis of the ring with vradial ~85 km/s~0.4 vd.\nThis is reminiscent of the findings in BzK15504 (Genzel et al. 2006). In that case the\nradial motions may be caused by streaming along an m=2 (bar-like) asymmetry.\nFurther, for a geometrically thin disk the residuals in data-model velocity dispersion\nare large throughout the ring. An additional random velocity component (\u03c30~55\u00b15\nkm/s) needs to be introduced everywhere in the ring. As a result a strong conclusion\nof the modeling is that vd/\u03c30= 4.3\u00b10.8 (middle panel of right column in Figure 1).\nThis conclusion is equivalent with the requirement in equation (1b) that the gas has a\nz-scale height of \u223c1.6 kpc. The disk/ring of BX482 clearly is thick and turbulent.\n\n15\n\n\fTable 2 summarizes the derived properties of BX482. Unfortunately there is no\nmulti-band photometry of this system and we cannot determine the stellar age of this\nsystem. Based on the approximate estimate of the stellar mass given above, the star\nformation age, M*/SFR, is relatively small and ranges between 0.3 and 0.6 Gyrs.\nBX482 also has a low [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio for its dynamical mass, which in turn may imply\nan early evolutionary state and fairly young age (section 4.1, top right inset of Fig.10).\nIn morphology BX482 resembles the young and blue, 'clump-cluster', 'tadpole' or\n'chain' galaxies in the HUDF studied by Elmegreen & Elmegreen (2005, 2006) and\nElmegreen et al. (2007). Elmegreen et al. (2007) emphasize that a fairly large fraction\nof their clumpy HUDF galaxies have radial brightness distributions flatter than that of\nexponential disks (Sersic indices <1), again similar to that of BX482 (Figure 1,\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b). Their brightness distributions do not exhibit a\nmaximum at the geometric centroid. MD41 and BX389 discussed below also are\nexamples of such chain/tadpole galaxies with flat brightness distributions.\n\n3.2 BzK6004-3482\nThe H\u03b1 emission in this fairly red and K-bright (Ks=18.9) s-BzK galaxy is also\nwell fitted by a ring or disk around a fairly massive central bulge (Figures 4 & 5).\nThat bulge is clearly detected in the SINFONI K-continuum (Figure 4 left column).\nProceeding then as for BX482 in the last section, the best fitting model (\u03c7r2=1.1) is a\nrotating wide ring centered at radius Rr=0.85\" (6.9 kpc) at inclination 35\u00b1100, major\naxis position angle -180\u00b1100, and maximum rotation velocity of 255 km/s. Its large\ninferred width (\u0394R~7 kpc) implies that the ring effectively is identical with a flat disk\n(upper right panel of Figure 5). The central bulge has a mass of 5.0\u00b10.5x1010 M\u001b,\n\n16\n\n\fcorresponding to Mdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\")=0.37\u00b10.04. The inferred vd/\u03c30 value\n(4.3\u00b11.5) is quite sensitive to the adopted inclination. An exponential disk model\n(dotted lines in Figure 5) is as good as the ring/disk model in terms of the H\u03b1 surface\nbrightness distribution but does not match the large central dispersion peak. An\nexponential disk model also overpredicts the rotation velocity (and thus mass) at\nR>1\" (bottom and middle left panels in Figure 5). A combination of an exponential\ndisk and a bulge fits the data as well as the broad ring (+bulge) model.\n\nThe derived parameters of BzK6004 are qualitatively very similar to but more\nextreme than those of BX482. The mass concentration parameter\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\") of BzK6004 is almost twice as large as that of BX482. The\nhigh K-flux, the red color, the ~2.5 Gyr stellar age derived from population synthesis\nmodeling of its spectral energy distribution (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008a) and the\nlarge [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio all suggest that BzK6004 is already quite evolved, perhaps also\nsignaling the presence of a central AGN. In many ways it resembles a modern Sa\ngalaxy. Is it possible that the larger mass concentration parameter of BzK6004 is a\nresult of evolution?\n\n3.3 Q2343-BX389, Q2343-BX610 & SSA22-MD41\nFor comparison to these two galaxies studied in LGSF mode we re-analyzed three\nadditional large BX galaxies (Q2343-BX389, Q2343-BX610 & SSA22-MD41) for\nwhich our seeing-limited data (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006) are of sufficiently high\nresolution to be able to place a significant constraint on the mass concentration\nparameter. Figures 6, 7 and 8 give the major axis cuts and best fitting models for the\n\n17\n\n\fthree BX galaxies. These results are remarkably similar to and consistent with those in\nthe two new sources presented above, although the poorer resolution of these data sets\nleads to increased uncertainties of the inferred parameters, as listed in Tables 2 and 3.\n\nIn SSA22-MD41 the data exhibit no significant evidence for a central mass in this\nhigh inclination 'chain galaxy'. The morphology of the NIC2 H160 and ACS images\n(F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b) also suggests a flat extended distribution, consistent\nwith our ring interpretation. The fairly linear rotation curve along the entire major axis\nof the galaxy, the lack of a central intensity maximum and of a central velocity\ndispersion peak set an upper limit of 15% (3\u03c3) to Mdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\"). Similar to\nthe situation in BX482, an exponential disk model is strongly disfavored if the H\u03b1 line\nemission and NIC2 H-band continuum maps trace the overall mass distribution. A\nconstant star formation modeling with parameters similar to those adopted above for\nBX482 together with the observed H- and K-band AB magnitudes of MD41\n(HAB=22.8, KAB=22.3, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al, 2008b) yields a live stellar mass of 1.75.6x1010 M\u001b. Adding this stellar mass to the gas mass estimate of Table 3 (2x1010\nM\u001b) is again consistent with the dynamical mass (7x1010 M\u001b) once allowance is made\nfor a 20-40% dark matter contribution (section 4). As in the case of BX482 there is\nlittle or no space for any additional unseen older stellar component. An exponential\ndisk model thus is not favored for MD41. Likewise the stellar mass estimate above\nand the extinction corrected H\u03b1-based star formation rate (Table 3) suggest a young\nstar formation age, 0.2-0.5 Gyrs.\n\nBX610 and BX389, on the other hand, have 1-3 Gyr stellar/star formation ages as\nderived from multi-band fitting to their spectral energy distributions (F\u00f6rster\n\n18\n\n\fSchreiber et al. 2008a). They also exhibit evidence for a central mass concentration\nconstituting about 40% of the dynamical mass in the central 10 kpc. The NIC2 H160\nimage of BX610, in particular, shows a set of bright clumps concentrated within ~0.4\"\nnear the dynamical center of the galaxy and surrounded by a lower surface brightness\ndisk of total radius ~ 0.7\" (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b). For BX389 an exponential\ndisk (+bulge) model provides equally good fits to the R<1\" kinematics as a wide ring\n(+bulge) model but probably overestimates the mass at R>1\"(Figure 7). For BX610\nan exponential disk model formally is even a somewhat better fit to the data than a\nring (+bulge) model (Figure 8).\n\n4. Discussion\nWe have shown in the last section that in the best SINS data sets we can now\nbegin to place constraints on the dynamical mass of a central bulge/inner disk, in\naddition to investigating in detail the dynamical properties of the surrounding outer\nproto-disk. In the following section we discuss the results and implications for the\nsources we have analyzed in 3.1-3.3. We now also include BX502, BzK15504 and\nZC782941 for the specific discussion of their random motions.\n\nEssentially the entire dynamical mass in the central 0.4\" of all sources must be\nbaryonic. As a first order estimate, consider a Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) dark\nmatter distribution with concentration parameters of Bullock et al. (2001), with a disk\nangular momentum parameter of \u03bbd~0.1 (characteristic for the five galaxies in Table\n2, Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007), and with a disk mass fraction (relative to the halo) of md\u2265\u03bbd,\nset by the requirement of gravitational instability of the disk (Mo, Mao & White\n19\n\n\f1998). With these assumptions the range of maximum disk rotation velocities in Table\n2 corresponds to halo circular velocities of 190\u00b170 km/s and dark matter mass\ncontribution of 109.9\u00b10.15 M\u001b within 3 kpc of the center. This mass corresponds to 510% percent of the dynamical masses we are inferring in Table 2. The dark matter\ncontributions to the total dynamical masses in Table 2 are larger. For the same\nassumptions as above the dark matter mass contributions within the disk/ring radii\n(~6kpc) are about 20% and within 10 kpc they are about 40% of the total dynamical\nmasses.\n\nA key question is how these early central bulges/central disks have formed. Are\nthey the result of major dissipative mergers, as motivated by the CDM merger\nparadigm and many recent simulations (e.g. Steinmetz & Navarro 2002)? Or have\nthey formed through internal, secular processes, as proposed for 'pseudo'-bulges in\nlate type disks at z~0 (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004)? While our current galaxy\nsample is too small to draw detailed and robust conclusions, we show below that the\ndata nevertheless provide interesting new and perhaps unexpected insights into this\nimportant issue. Obviously a first hint is that none of the five galaxies in Table 2\nexhibit dynamical or structural evidence for a major merger (Shapiro et al. 2008,\nF\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b).\n\n20\n\n\f4.1 mass concentration parameter as a function of evolutionary\nstate\nIn the following section we explore the dependence of the new mass concentration\nparameter on other properties of the galaxies. We find that Mdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\")\nincreases with evolutionary state/age.\n\nFor the five galaxies discussed in the last section the mass concentration\nparameter appears to increase with the [NII]/H\u03b1 flux ratio (upper left panel of Figure\n10). Unless the [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio is strongly affected by a central AGN, [NII]/H\u03b1 is a\nproxy of the oxygen to hydrogen abundance ratio in the ionized interstellar medium\n(Pettini & Pagel 2004, Erb et al. 2006a). None of the five galaxies show kinematic\nevidence in our SINFONI data for a strong central AGN. The [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio in Table\n3 refers to the value in the disk on scales of ~10 kpc, which should not be strongly\naffected by an AGN, even if a weaker or buried AGN is present in the center. Erb et\nal. (2006a) have studied the mass-metallicity relation at z~2. They found that\n[NII]/H\u03b1 scales with stellar mass, the 'mass-metallicity' relation. They also conclude\nthat '....the z~2 mass-metallicity relation is driven by the increase in metallicity as the\ngas fraction decreases through star formation.....'. At a given mass the metallicity\nwould thus appear to probe the evolutionary state of a galaxy.\n\nThe upper right panel of Figure 10 shows that in our z~2 SINS sample [NII]/H\u03b1\nindeed is correlated with the 'star formation age', M*/SFR (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2008a). This is the time required to form the current stellar mass at the current star\n\n21\n\n\fformation rate. As a result the mass concentration parameter Mdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\")\nalso scales with star formation age. The star formation age, however, is necessarily\nless well determined than the [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio because of the uncertainties in extinction\nand stellar mass. We thus prefer to show the correlation between\nMdyn(\u22640.4\")/Mdyn(1.2\") and [NII]/H\u03b1 in the upper left panel of Figure10. In further\nsupport of the correlation between metallicity and evolutionary state three of our\nSINS galaxies (BX610, BzK6004 & BzK6397: F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006,\nBuschkamp et al. 2008) exhibit a significant radial gradient of the [NII]/H\u03b1 line ratio,\nimplying that the central regions have a ~20% greater oxygen metallicity than the\nouter disks. The bulge regions of these three galaxies have super-solar metallicities\n(Buschkamp et al. 2008).\n\nObviously the statistical significance of a correlation based on five points is\nlimited. Keeping this caveat in mind our data thus suggest a scenario where the\nfraction of the central bulge mass (including that of the surrounding central disk)\nappears to increase secularly over time scales of less then a few Gyrs.\n\n4.2 turbulent and clumpy disks\nThe eight actively star-forming galaxies in Table 3 (~0.2-3 M\u001byr-1kpc-2) all have a\nlarge component of random local gas motion, \u03c30~45-90 km/s, in agreement with the\nearlier finding of F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. (2006). Given the spatial and spectral\nproperties of the other ~50 galaxies in the SINS survey, this conclusion appears to\nhold generally for the entire population of z~2 star forming galaxies studied so far by\nintegral field spectroscopy (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, 2008a, Wright et al. 2007,\n\n22\n\n\fLaw et al. 2007). The ratio vd/\u03c30 ranges from 2 to 5 in the seven large disk galaxies,\nas compared to 10-20 in z~0 disks (e.g. Dib, Bell & Burkert 2006). Yet smaller values\nof vd/\u03c30~1 are found for a number of the compact BX galaxies, such as BX502 (Table\n3, Law et al. 2007 and in preparation, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008a). These latter\nsystems appear to be gas rich and 'dispersion dominated'. The z~2 BX/s-BzK\ngalaxies in the SINS survey are turbulent and geometrically thick (hz ~ 1 kpc).\n\nThe high resolution H\u03b1 and H/K images of the BX/s-BzK galaxies, as well as the\nrest-frame UV-continuum images in most other high redshift star-forming galaxies are\ntypically dominated by a modest number (5-10) of bright, compact clumps (Cowie,\nHu & Songaila 1995, van den Bergh et al. 1996, Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005, 2006,\nElmegreen et al. 2007, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b). In many cases these giant starforming complexes make up a significant fraction (~20-40%) of the mass of the disk\n(Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005, Elmegreen et al. 2007, Genzel et al. 2006). The\nSINFONI AO data sets of BX482 and BzK15504 as well as the NIC2/ACS images of\nBX482, BX389, BX610 and MD41 have sufficiently high resolution for determining\nthe intrinsic clump sizes. Their FWHM diameters, Lc, range from 0.15\" to 0.45\"\n(Figure 9). In BX482 (where both NIC2 and H\u03b1 data are available) stellar and gas\nclump sizes are comparable. Elmegreen and Elmegreen (2005, 2006) find similar\nresults for the 'clump cluster'/'chain' galaxies in the HUDF, on the basis of\nphotometric analysis of rest-frame UV/ACS images. In their study of 10 clumpcluster galaxies at <zphot>~2.3 Elmegreen & Elmegreen (2005) infer an average clump\nsize of Lc=0.22''. The HUDF galaxies are somewhat lower luminosity/mass analogs\nof the galaxies we are studying here (<Mgal>~1010.7M\u001b, <SFRgal>~20 M\u001byr-1,\n<vd>~150 km/s, <Mc>~108.8 M\u001b: Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005). These galaxies\n\n23\n\n\fappear to dominate the z>1 cosmic star formation in the HUDF (Elmegreen et al.\n2007).\n\nThe Jeans length in a gravitationally unstable gas disk with Qgas,Toomre\u22641 is\n\nLJeans =\n\n\u03c0 \u239b \u03c30 \u239e\n\n\u239c \u239f Rr QToomre\n2 \u239d vd \u23a0\n\n(2),\n\nwhich yields <LJeans> ~ 2.5 kpc or 0.3\" for the parameters appropriate for the galaxies\nin Tables 2 and 3. The observed sizes of the giant H\u03b1 clumps/star forming complexes\nin the clumpy z~2 galaxies are consistent with the Jeans lengths inferred from the\ngalaxies' kinematics properties. The H\u03b1 clumps thus may be initially close to virial\nequilibrium. Given their large sizes and the overall large surface densities of the\ngalaxy disks (a few 102 M\u001bpc-2), as derived from our dynamical measurements, it is\nclear that the star formation complexes must be very massive (see also Elmegreen &\nElmegreen 2005)\nL2c vd2\n~ 109.4 \u00b1 0.5 M :\nMc =\n4GRd\n\n(3).\n\nThese masses are obviously much larger than even the most massive HII regions in\nz~0 starburst galaxies (107...8 M\u001b).\n\nIn the standard picture of disk formation from gas accretion from the halo (e.g.\nMo, Mao & White 1998) the radius of the initial star-forming disk is set by the\ncharacteristic angular momentum parameter \u03bbh (<\u03bbh>\u223c0.04, Bett et al. 2007) of the\naccreting gas, Rd~\u03bbhRvir/\u221a2, where Rvir (~100-150 kpc, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006)\nis the virial radius of the dark matter halo in which the disk resides. This scenario is in\ngood agreement with the observed sizes of the BX/s-BzK disks in the SINS sample\n\n24\n\n\fprovided that the baryonic angular momentum is conserved during the accretion and\nthat the larger systems we are discussing here are associated with halos of fairly high\n(\u03bbh~0.1) angular momentum parameters (Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007). Such high baryonic\nangular momentum parameters may be the result of the specific formation paths of\ntheir halos (Sales et al. 2008, in preparation).\n\n4.3 secular evolution is efficient at high redshift\nIn a smooth gaseous disk the time scale for radial secular evolution is given by the\nviscous drag time (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Silk & Norman 1981, Lin & Pringle\n1987, Silk 2001)\n\ntvisc =\n\nR2\n\n\u03b7\n\nfor viscosity \u03b7\n\n(4),\n\nsuch that for \u03b7 = \u03b1 hz\u03c3 0 (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) with z-scale height hz ,\ndimensionless parameter \u03b1 \u2248 1 and disk rotation velocity vd = \u239b\u239c R \u239e\u239f \u03c3 0\n\u239d hz \u23a0\n2\n\ntvisc\n\n2\n\nR2\n1\u239bv \u239e \u239b R\u239e 1\u239bv \u239e\n=\n= \u239c d \u239f \u239c \u239f = \u239c d \u239f tdyn ( R )\n\u03b1 hz\u03c3 0 \u03b1 \u239d \u03c3 0 \u23a0 \u239d vd \u23a0 \u03b1 \u239d \u03c3 0 \u23a0\n\n(5).\n\nOnce fragmentation and star formation sets in (Qgas\u22641, eq.2), the secular evolution\ntime scale is then given by the dynamical friction time scale of the clumps against the\nbackground of the disk/halo. Based on Chandrasekhar's formula (Noguchi 1999, Silk\n2001, Immeli et al. 2004a, b, Binney & Tremaine 2008) the dynamical friction time\nscale is\n2\n\n2\n\n\u239b R \u239e\n\u239b vd \u239e\ntdf = \u03b2 \u239c\n\u239f tdyn ( R) = \u03b2 \u239c \u239f tdyn (R)\n\u239d \u03bbJeans \u23a0\n\u239d \u03c30 \u23a0\n\n(6),\n\nwith an (uncertain) dimensionless factor \u03b2\u223c0.3 (see above references). Here tdyn is the\ndynamical time scale, tdyn=2.4x107R6/v250 yrs. Here R6 is the disk radius in units of 6\nkpc and v250 is the disk circular velocity in units of 250 km/s. Other secular processes\n25\n\n\fin a stellar disk, such as bar formation and transport, occur on a time scale tbar ~ 30-50\ntdyn(R6) (Immeli et al. 2004 a,b, Bournaud & Combes 2002).\n\nDisk galaxies at z~0 have vd/\u03c30~10-20 (e.g. Dib et al. 2006) and secular processes\nproceed on a time scale of several Gyrs or more (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004). The\nz~2 star- forming galaxies we are studying here are clearly different. In these galaxies\nvd/\u03c30 ranges between 1 and 5. Compared to z~0, gaseous and stellar processes proceed\nfaster by at least one order of magnitude or more,\ntsec ( z ~ 2) ~ 10 \u2212 30 tdyn ( R ) ~ 0.5 Gyr ~ tdyn (R vir ) ~ 0.2 t H ( z ~ 2)\n\n(7) .\n\nHere tdyn(Rvir) is the dynamical time for crossing the virial radius of the dark matter\nhalo. Exactly which secular process dominates depends on the stellar and gas fraction,\nwhether Qgas is greater or less than Qstars (Immeli et al, 2004 a,b), and whether bar\ninstabilities occur in a turbulent environment.\n\nWe propose that in the five cases we have presented in this paper, we are\nwitnessing the rapid buildup of central bulges through such secular processes. Our\nobservations are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation work of\nNoguchi (1999), Immeli et al. (2004a,b) and Bournaud, Elmegreen & Elmegreen\n(2007), which we discuss further in section 4.5.\n\nSecular evolution of disks has been previously considered for the origin of the socalled 'pseudo-bulges' of z~0 late type spiral galaxies (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004),\ngrowing over a timescale that is comparable to the present Hubble time. Such a long\ntime scale appears to be at variance with the uniformly old age of stars in the bulge of\nthe Milky Way (Zoccali et al. 2003), suggesting formation by early merging rather\n\n26\n\n\fthan late disk instability. Our finding of a very short timescale for the disk instability\nin z~2 disks reopens this issue, making it quite plausible that the Galactic bulge\nresulted from fast disk instability some 10 Gyr ago. In support of this conjecture\nMelendez et al. (2008) have found that the \u03b1/Fe-element abundances of the old\nGalactic bulge are more or less identical to those of the thick disk, implying that these\ntwo components are coeval and have both formed rapidly.\n\n4.4 large turbulent velocities driven by cold flows\nIt is not obvious what causes the large velocity dispersions and large implied scale\nheights of the high-z disks. Here it is important to realize that the rest-frame UV/optical continuum data of our sample galaxies as well as the HUDF galaxies of\nElmegreen & Elmegreen (2005, 2006) imply the same ~1 kpc z-scale heights in the\nstars as in the ionized gas traced by H\u03b1. The large turbulence is probably a property of\nthe entire star-forming gas and stellar layer, and not just a feature of the ionized gas.\nOne obvious possibility is that these motions are the result of feedback from the\nintense star formation itself: by the combined actions of winds, supernova explosions\nand radiation transport (Efstathiou 2000, Silk 2001, Thompson, Quataert & Murray\n2005). Theoretical estimates and extrapolations from local starburst galaxies (Monaco\n2004, Dib, Bell & Burkert 2004) make a plausible case that the observed velocity\ndispersions (45-90 km/s) can be reached at the observed star formation surface\ndensities in the BX/s-BzK galaxies. In this case one would expect that the vd/\u03c30 ratio\nscales inversely with the star formation rate surface density \u03a3SFR. The bottom left\npanel of Figure 10 is a first attempt of testing this assertion. There is no obvious\ncorrelation between the observed values of vd/\u03c30 and \u03a3SFR among the 7 massive\ngalaxies in Table 3. The turbulence in the compact, young and high star forming\n\n27\n\n\fsurface density system BX502 is much greater than in the other galaxies. Including\nthis system may add some evidence that feedback may indeed be at work in the\nsystems with the largest star formation surface densities. BX502 has a much lower\nmass than the other seven galaxies, and it is not yet clear how these compact\ndispersion limited systems relate to the massive large disks and whether they have\nexperienced a recent merger (Law et al. 2007).\n\nA second possibility is that the turbulence is driven by the accreting gas as it\nenters the forming disk. Recent high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations by Ocvirk,\nPichon & Tessier (2008) clearly demonstrate that in the cold flow regime (Dekel &\nBirnboim 2006, Kere\u0161 et al. 2005) gas is brought in radially along the filaments of the\ncosmic web, from well outside the virial radius of the halo and all the way to the disk\nregion. It would appear to be unavoidable that the rapidly inflowing (vinflow=\u03b3vd, with\na dimensionless number \u03b3~1-1.4) gas streamers and clumps (minor mergers?)\nembedded in the cold flows shock and stir up the forming protodisk (e.g. Abadi et al.\n2003). There are no realistic simulations yet of the disk/flow interaction and shocks.\n\u2022\n\nThe rate of specific energy gain is E acc =\u03b2\u03b32vd2/tacc(z), where tacc=<Mgas/(dMacc/dt)>z\nis the gas accretion time at z. If the rate of turbulent energy loss of the disk clumps is\n\u2022\n\ndriven by their physical collision rate E coll =-\u03c302/tcoll, the velocity dispersion is given\nby (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006)\n\n\u03c3 0 ~ \u03b2\u03b3 2vd \u239b\u239c tcoll t \u239e\u239f\n\u239d\n\nacc\n\n\u23a0\n\n(8).\n\nFor the parameters of the observed disks with 5-10 virialized clumps of radius ~1\nkpc, the collisional time scale is close to the dynamical time scale of the ring/disk,\ntcoll=\u03b5tdyn with \u03b5~1. From a statistical analysis of the Millenium dark matter simulation\n\n28\n\n\f(Springel et al. 2005), Genel et al. (2008, see also Birnboim, Dekel & Neistein 2007)\nderive a fitting formula for the average accretion time scale of dark matter as a\nfunction of z(t) and halo mass Mh,\n\u239b1+ z \u239e\n< tacc ( z , M h ) > = 2.27 x10 \u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d 3.2 \u23a0\n9\n\n\u22122.2\n\n\u239b\n\u239e\nMh\n\u239c\n\u239f\n12\n\u239d 2 x10 M : \u23a0\n\n\u22120.08\n\n(yrs)\n\n(9).\n\nFor the cosmic baryon fraction of ~0.2 the baryonic accretion rates implied by\nequation (9) would also be sufficient to explain sustained star formation rates of\n>100M\u001byr-1 in the massive BX/s-BzK galaxies in this paper. Equations 8 and 9 then\nyield\n\n\u239b vd \u239e\n\u22121.1\n-1 \u22122\n\u22121 \u22121 1/ 2\n\u22120.04\n\u239c \u239f ~ 9.7 \u03b2 \u03b3 ( v250 R6 \u03b5 ) \u23a1\u23a3(1 + z ) / 3.2 \u23a4\u23a6 M 2e12\n\u239d \u03c30 \u23a0\n\n(10),\n\nwhere M2e12 is the halo mass in units of 2x1012 M\u001b. These numbers are appropriate for\nthe massive BX/s-BzK galaxies we are considering here. The simple estimate in\nequation (10) suggests that the conversion of accretion energy may account for the\nobserved turbulent motions if the product \u03b2 \u03b32\u03b51/2 exceeds ~2. Equation (10) also\nindicates that over 2-3 Gyrs of cosmic evolution (from z~4 to z~2) the average vd/\u03c3\nratio would be expected to increase by a factor of 1.75, from the cosmological\ndecrease of the accretion rate. A still larger decrease in the accretion rate would be\npredicted once the halos grow above the hot/cold flow boundary (Dekel & Birnboim\n2006, Ocvirk et al. 2008) and if AGN feedback is effective. Stirring of the disk\nturbulence by the accretion flows would thus naturally predict that an early phase of\nrapid accretion leading to clumpy, thick protodisks and secular bulge formation is\nfollowed a few Gyr time scale later by a less violent re-growth of disks, perhaps\nrelated to the formation of thin disks.\n\n29\n\n\fThe lower right panel in Figure 10 is an attempt of exploring whether there is a\ntrend of vd/\u03c30 with evolutionary state, again as above in form of the [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio.\nWith the exception of BX482 there may indeed be a trend for the more mature\nsources to be also the ones with the smallest relative fraction of turbulent motion\n(largest vd/\u03c30). As with the other trends discussed in this section, a larger sample of\nwell resolved kinematic data sets will be required to make more definite statements.\n\nThe scenario we are discussing relies on the assumption that the accreting\nmaterial is highly gas-rich. A simple check of this assertion is possible if one assumes\nthat below a certain critical halo mass, supernova feedback prevents early star\nformation to convert a large fraction of the baryonic gas into stars (Dekel &Silk 1986,\nEfstathiou 2000). Following Dekel & Silk (1986) and Dekel & Woo (2003) this\ncritical baryonic mass is given by\n3\n\nM b , crit\n\n\u239b vd , crit \u239e \u239b 1 + z \u239e\n= 2.0 x10 \u239c\n\u239f \u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d 100 km/s \u23a0 \u239d 3.25 \u23a0\n10\n\n\u22122 / 3\n\n(11),\n\nwhere we have again assumed a baryon fraction in the disk of b~0.2. Halos with\nmasses below Mb,crit/b form stars inefficiently and should be gas rich. This critical\nmass is a factor 3.5 to10 smaller than the dynamical/stellar masses of the five galaxies\nin Table 2. Given that the galaxies we have observed appear not to be undergoing\nmajor mergers, any minor merger accretion would have to have a mass ratio >3:1.\nSuch minor mergers would be at or below Mcrit, and thus would be very gas rich\naccording to equation (11). Here we presume that in the limit of very minor mergers\n(mass ratios >>10:1) smooth gas accretion and a series of minor mergers are virtually\nidentical.\n\n30\n\n\fWe conclude from this section that if the trends suggested by the present data are\nconfirmed, the level of turbulence in the high-z disks may be strongly influenced by\n(the evolution of) the accretion rate, as well as stellar feedback in the most intensely\nstar forming systems. The large observed turbulence of the high-z disks may be\nplausibly understood with current estimates of 'cold flow' gas accretion rates based\non dark matter simulations.\n\n4.5 Comparison to simulations\nStimulated initially by the clumpy appearance of high-z galaxies on HST restframe UV-images ('chain' galaxies: Cowie, Hu & Songaila 1995, van den Bergh et al.\n1996) and later by the work of Elmegreen & Elmegreen (2005, 2006), several groups\nhave carried out numerical simulations of the evolution of gas-rich, fragmentation\nunstable, 'clumpy' galaxies with star formation recipes (Noguchi 1999, Semelin &\nCombes 2002, Immeli et al. 2004a,b, Bournaud et al. 2007). These simulations vary in\ntechnical approach (N-body simulations vs. hydro-grid code) and initial assumptions.\nFor instance, Bournaud et al. (2007) adopt an ab initio unstable disk while Semelin &\nCombes (2002) start with hot gas that then becomes gravitationally unstable after\ncooling to the molecular phase. Noguchi (1999) and Immeli et al. (2004a,b) let the\ndisk to grow to instability from rapid gas inflow along the polar axis. The latter\nauthors start with a pure gas disk in a dark matter halo. Bournaud et al. introduce, in\naddition, an initial stellar component making up 50% of the mass. While Bournaud et\nal. assume that the initial stellar disk is already geometrically thick but do not include\nstellar (supernova) feedback, Immeli et al. consider supernova feedback with a twophase interstellar medium. Keeping in mind these differences as well as the\n\n31\n\n\fsimplifications that none of these simulations begin from self-consistent cosmological\ninitial conditions, all these studies find essentially the same salient features;\n\u2022\n\nrapidly forming, very gas-rich disks will become violently and globally\n\nunstable to fragmentation into giant star forming clumps if the Toomre\ninstability parameter in the gas layer suddenly becomes Qg\u22641 across much of\nthe entire disk. This requires that the (cold) gas accretion rate is high (>100\nM\u001byr-1) and happens on a time scale comparable to the orbital time scale of\nthe initial disk (~0.5 Gyrs in the simulations of Noguchi 1999 and Immeli et\nal. 2004a,b);\n\u2022\n\nonce fragmentation sets in, the disk evolves rapidly during a short-\n\nlived (0.4-1 Gyr) 'clump phase'. During this phase star formation proceeds\nrapidly in the giant clumps, with a star formation rate comparable to the gas\naccretion rate. The strong dynamical interactions heat the gas and stellar\ncomponents with a resulting z-scale height of ~ 1 kpc;\n\u2022\n\nas a result of efficient dynamical friction of the clumps against the\n\nbackground of the rest of the disk, the clumps spiral into the center and form a\ncentral bulge and a surrounding smooth exponential stellar disk. Clump-clump\ncollisions dissipate the large turbulent motions.\n\nSamland & Gerhard (2003) consider a case with a much lower accretion rate\n(~20-40 M\u001byr-1). In this model, the disk grows from inside out, with a bulge forming\nfirst from low angular momentum gas inflow. The surrounding disk is quite thick and\nthe most active star formation occurs in a ring that moves over time outwards from\nthe center. The reason for outward propagation is that the gas infall can no longer\ncompensate for the gas consumption by star formation in the center. This in turn is\n\n32\n\n\fcaused by the decrease in gas accretion to the central regions due to increasing\nspecific angular momentum of the infalling material. The ring grows in radius until\neventually the disk becomes unstable and forms a bar.\n\nOne prediction of these simulations and the generic hypothesis of clump evolution\nfrom smooth accretion of gas from the halo is that the clumps would plausibly have\nsimilar metallicities while the interclump gas would be expected to have much lower\nmetallicities. This is indeed consistent with our current data, to within the limitations\nof signal-to-noise ratio and resolution. With the exception of radial [NII]/H\u03b1 gradients\nmentioned above there are no indications for significant [NII]/H\u03b1 variations from\nclump to clump in the disk regions of the five galaxies of our main sample, nor in the\nthree additional larger systems in Table 3. The signal to noise ratio is not yet\nsufficient to explore the interclump metallicity.\n\nIt is remarkable how well the observed properties of the young disks we are\nstudying in this paper, the simple 'back of the envelope' considerations presented\nabove and the more detailed simulations appear to be consistent with each other. The\ninteresting consequence and prediction of these simulations is that these clumpy,\nturbulent disk galaxies are going through a transitory 'fragmentation' phase at the\nvery beginning of their evolution.\n\n4.6 Comments on asymmetries\nIn this paper and in our previous papers (e.g. F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, Genzel\net al. 2006) we have emphasized the surprisingly symmetric properties of the\nkinematics of the UV-/optically selected massive star forming galaxies we have\n33\n\n\fobserved. This is an obvious (and intended) simplification. Asymmetries of the\nbrightness and velocity distributions are present in essentially all the SINS data sets\n(this paper, F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006, 2008, Genzel et al. 2006). As discussed in\nthe section on BX482 (3.1) local variations in extinction, excitation and local current\nstar formation events may account for some of these asymmetries even if the\nunderlying kinematics and potential are intrinsically symmetric. However, there are\nclearly are also intrinsic variations in the kinematic properties that can be seen from\nasymmetric rotation curves (e.g. Figures 7 & 8) and from residuals in the velocity\ndistributions (e.g. Figures 2 & 4) after subtraction of a first order rotation model (see\nGenzel et al. 2006, Cresci et al. 2008, and F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008 for more\nexamples). These features may be a natural consequence of asymmetries in the\nunderlying potential and gas accretion processes. Lopsided rotation curves as\nobserved in a number of the SINS galaxies have also been seen in the HI kinematics\nof some z~0 galaxies (Swaters et al 1999) and are ascribed there to long-lived\nintrinsic m=1 modes in the underlying potential and to interactions with nearby\ngalaxies. At high redshift strong asymmetries would be naturally be expected to be\ncaused by the non-isotropic and filamentary accretion, by the large radial velocities of\nthe accreting gas and by the minor merger activity (e.g. Ocvirk et al. 2008). In the\nframework of the gas rich, clumpy galaxies very significant local perturbations from a\nsmooth rotation curves are expected as a result of the large clump masses (Immeli et\nal. 2003a,b, Bournaud et al. 2007).\n\n4.7 Consequences for galaxy evolution\nWe have presented evidence that massive bulges and spheroids (with masses up to\nat least 5x1010 M\u001b) may have formed on a time scale of 1-3 Gyrs through secular\n34\n\n\fevolution from gas-rich, turbulent disks. The upper end of this mass range would be\nconsistent with bulge masses for z~0 Sa bulges. These turbulent disks grow from\nsteady and rapid gas accretion (including minor mergers) from the dark matter halos\nand fragment into very large star formation clumps. Unless major mergers happen\nduring this phase, it would appear that most galaxies experience such a 'clump'-phase\nthat is an inevitable consequence of the combination of rapid continuous gas\naccretion, large gas fraction and large turbulence. This conclusion is consistent with\nthe large fraction of such clumpy galaxies in the HUDF (Elmegreen et al. 2007) and\nthe strong correlation between stellar mass and star formation in the z~2 UV- and\noptically selected galaxies (Erb et al. 2006c, Daddi et al.2007). In addition to rapid\nbulge buildup this process would also account rather easily for the fact that there are\nno descendent massive, thick disks at z~0 (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2006). Estimates\nbased on the Millenium simulation suggest that the major merger rate is too low to\ndestroy all M*~1011 M\u001b galaxies between z~ 2 and 0 (Genel et al. 2008, Fakhouri &\nMa 2008, Conroy et al. 2008). It is tempting to speculate that the thick, old stellar\ndisks seen in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies (e.g. Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn\n2002, Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006) are the remnants of this z~2-3 phase of transient\nevolution of clumpy, turbulent disks fed by rapid cold flows.\n\nEfficient secular evolution may also help to explain the remarkably efficient and\nrapid star formation in the z~2 star-forming galaxy population (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al.\n2006, Genzel et al. 2006, Daddi et al. 2007). Dav\u00e9 (2007) has introduced the star\nformation activity parameter\n\n\u239b\n\n\u239e\nM*\n\u239f\n\u239d SFR \u22c5 (t H ( z ) \u2212 1 Gyr) \u23a0\n\n\u03b1 SF ( z ) = \u239c\n\n35\n\n(12),\n\n\fwhere \u03b1SF is equal to unity if the stellar formation time scale M*/SFR is just equal to\nthe available cosmic (Hubble) time at z, taking into account that most of the star\nformation occurred after re-ionization (< 1Gyr). Figure 11 shows that most of the\nobserved z~2 star-forming s-BzK and BX galaxies, including the majority of the\nSINS survey galaxies (F\u00f6rster Schreiber et al. 2008b) and the five galaxies in Table 3\nwith a determination of M*, appear to have formed their stars on a time scale a few\ntimes faster than the available Hubble time (see also Daddi et al. 2007). This is in\ndisagreement with the simulations for which \u03b1SF~1 (Dav\u00e9 2007, Kitzbichler & White\n2007).\n\nSecular evolution together with efficient star formation at high gas surface\ndensities may explain why the star formation activity parameter \u03b1SF is significantly\nless than one at high redshift. For a Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation recipe, the star\nformation rate surface density scales approximately inversely proportional to\ndynamical time scale (Kennicutt 1998, Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2007). If the gas in the initial\ndisks fragments into compact dense clumps and at the same time the overall disk\ncontracts as a result of the dynamical friction process, the star formation activity\nparameter would naturally decrease by a factor of several. Further, Bouch\u00e9 et al.\n(2007) have presented evidence that the star formation efficiency per dynamical time\nscale in high density star-forming galaxies, such as the z~2 BX/s-BzKs, is about 0.07,\nor 3 times larger than that estimated for normal z~0 spirals (Kennicutt 1998). For this\npurpose gas masses were inferred from CO rotational line luminosities calibrated at\nthe low gas surface density end by the normal z~0 star forming galaxies from\nKennicutt (1998). On the high end the calibration is by z~0 ULIRGs (Kennicutt 1998)\nand z~1-3 SMGs (Tacconi et al. 2006, 2008). For the normal galaxies Bouch\u00e9 et al.\n\n36\n\n\f(2007) used a Milky Way CO-to-H2 conversion factor (as did Kennicutt 1998), while\nfor ULIRGs and SMGs Bouch\u00e9 et al. applied a CO-to-H2 conversion factor ~0.2 times\nthat of the Milky Way (see Tacconi et al. 2008 for a more detailed discussion). For the\ngas surface densities derived in this way for the BX/s-BzK galaxies the Bouch\u00e9 et al.\n(2007) fit gives the following expression for the \u03b1SF parameter\n\u239b\n\u03a3 gas \u03c4 dyn\n\u239e\n\u03b1 SF ( z ~ 2) = 0.24 \u239c\n-1\n-2 \u239f\n\u239d 20 M : yr kpc \u23a0\n\n\u22120.14\n\u22121\nR6 kpc v250\nkm / s\n\n(13).\n\nSince the above estimate comes mainly from dynamical measurements and gas\nfractions calibrated on CO observations from gas-rich, z~0-3 mergers (Tacconi et al.\n2008), the above expression would appear to be relatively immune to changes in the\nassumed initial mass function. With the Bouch\u00e9 et al. (2007) calibration of the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation the gas fractions in the five galaxies we have studied\nrange between 0.16 and 0.31 of the dynamical masses (Table 2) and the gas\nexhaustion time scales, Mgas/SFR(H\u03b1), are ~2x108 yrs, significantly smaller than the\nSED ages or the stellar buildup ages, M*/SFR(H\u03b1). As it is highly unlikely that all\nBX/BzK galaxies are about to run out of gas and will soon stop forming stars, this\ndiscrepancy argues for a continuous gas supply (Erb 2008), and thus is consistent with\nthe continuous gas accretion model. However, the gas masses in Table 2 are\nobviously based on a somewhat uncertain, indirect method. Direct measurements of\ngas masses from CO rotational line luminosities would be highly desirable. First CO\nobservations in a few BX/BzK galaxies have resulted in detections in two cases\n(possibly implying much larger gas masses than in Table 2: Daddi et al. 2008) and\nupper limits in three other cases (Tacconi et al. 2008). These initial observations do\nnot yet provide a clear-cut test of whether the Bouch\u00e9 et al. (2007) calibration is\nappropriate, especially when taking into account the uncertainty in the CO-\n\n37\n\n\fluminosity-to-H2-gas mass conversion factor (see Tacconi et al. 2008 for a\ndiscussion).\n\nThe combination of efficient secular evolution and higher efficiency star\nformation may thus be able to account for the observed rapid buildup of stellar mass\nat high redshift. It needs to be explored whether secular evolution may also be able to\ninfluence the buildup of the central massive black holes and account for the black hole\nmass to bulge mass (or velocity dispersion) relation.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have presented high quality SINFONI/VLT integral field spectroscopy of five\nlarge M~1011M\u001b disk galaxies at z~2. Aided in part by laser guide star adaptive\noptics, our data constrain the galaxy dynamics on scales of \u2264 3 kpc and allow us to\ndetect and estimate the dynamical mass of the central bulge/inner disk, in addition to\nthat of the outer disk.\nWe find evidence for a substantial central bulge and/or central disk in four of the\nfive cases, whose mass fraction relative to that of the disk appears to scale with the\n[NII]/H\u03b1 ratio and star formation age of the galaxies.\nInterpreting these observations in terms of an evolutionary sequence, we propose\nthat massive bulges/central disks at z~2-3 can grow on a time scale of \u22641 Gyr through\nsecular evolution of early turbulent, gas-rich disks. Numerical simulations and simple\nanalytical estimates suggest that clumpy, turbulent disks may be a transient phase in\nthe early evolution of most, if not all, galaxies that are going through a phase of rapid\n'cold' accretion from the surrounding halos. To a significant extent the large\n\n38\n\n\fturbulence may be stirred up by the kinetic energy of the accreting gas itself. Precisely\nbecause of the large turbulence, internal secular disk evolution then proceeds on a\ntime scale \u22641 Gyr, an order of magnitude more rapidly than at z~0. After the clumpy,\nturbulent phase is ended, the product may be a (massive) central bulge surrounded by\na remnant thick exponential disk whose z~0 relic is the old thick disk component in\nmany nearby galaxies. As a result of the cosmological evolution of accretion rates\ncombined with the ceasing of rapid cold flows once halos grow above ~1011.5-12 M\u001b,\naccretion rates strongly decrease with decreasing redshift such that the disk turbulence\nsubsides and maturing thin disks grow at z\u22641.\nThese secular effects, along with more efficient star formation at high gas surface\ndensities may also help to account for the ~1Gyr time scales for the buildup of the\nstellar component that appears to be typical at z~2. One is left to wonder whether the\nsame secular processes also help build up central black holes in this epoch of\nmaximum QSO activity.\n\nAcknowledgements: We thank the staff of Paranal Observatory for their support.
