A new family of exactly solvable models may offer some answers.\n\nDuring the past 40 years, understanding quantum systems involving many particles has been one of the main goals\nof theoretical physics. This kind of research is designed not to work out the laws of interactions between particles,\nbut, assuming that these interactions are already known, to calculate their effects on a system of n particles. A system\nwhere n is large constitutes the 'many-body problem', and can exhibit rich behaviour, including phase transitions,\nsuperconductivity and Bose-Einstein condensation. The impact of exactly solvable theoretical models on research\ninto these systems is undeniable. With few exceptions, previous exact solutions have applied only to one-dimensional\nsystems. But writing in Physical Review Letters, Dukelsky et. al. [1] introduce a new family of exactly solvable\ntheoretical models dealing with quantum many-body systems in any number of dimensions: one, two, three or even\nmore.\nA wide range of many-body systems has been studied, with varying numbers of particles. For example, systems\nof nuclei (n \u2248 102 nucleons) are important in nuclear physics, and atomic and molecular physics deal with systems\ninvolving n \u2248 102 electrons, whereas mesoscopic (n \u2248 102 \u2212 106 ) and macroscopic (n \u2248 1023 ) systems arise in\ncondensed-matter physics. Real systems are usually extraordinarily complex and involve a large set of parameters,\nmost of which are irrelevant for discussing the phenomena under investigation. So theoretical physicists begin by\ndefining a model that is, an idealized system much simpler than the real one, but retaining all the necessary ingredients\nto discuss the physical properties of interest. However, there are only a few examples of 'exactly solvable' models of\nthis type in which one can calculate exactly all the possible quantum states and their energies and/or the various\nthermodynamic quantities of the system. Such exact solutions always play a decisive role in theoretical physics.\nWith very few exceptions, the exact solutions of many-body problems can be found only in one dimension. For\nexample, the Tomonaga-Luttinger solution for a one-dimensional system of interacting fermions (particles such as\nelectrons) demonstrates how the Landau-Fermi liquid description of electrons, which has been the theoretical basis of\nthe whole quantum theory of solids, breaks down in one or two dimensions. This discovery had a considerable impact\non condensed-matter physics, and gave rise to a new field concerned with the properties of the one-dimensional state\nknown as the 'Luttinger liquid'. In contrast, several exactly solvable models have been developed in nuclear physics\nthat make use of group-theory techniques. These models are based on the concept of dynamical symmetries, and a\nnon-trivial generalization of this approach is the 'pairing model', in which particles that form a pair interact through\na force with a particular strength. Such a model has been applied to discussions of superfluidity, and also to studies\nof superconductivity in small metallic grains.\nThe pairing model was solved exactly by Richardson [2] more than 30 years ago, a result that passed almost\nunnoticed despite its enormous potential impact on nuclear as well as condensed-matter physics. In their paper,\nDukelsky and colleagues [1] provide an important generalization of Richardson's work, leading to new classes of pairing\nmodels that are exactly solvable in any dimension. To obtain this result, the authors apply group-theoretical and\nalgebraic methods similar to those already used by Gaudin [3]. They discover three classes of integrable (a remarkable\nproperty that makes them mathematically tractable) pairing models, which they were able to solve exactly.\nIn analogy with the work of Gaudin, the three new classes of pairing models found by Dukelsky et. al. [1] are\nnamed the rational, the trigonometric and the hyperbolic models. The authors go on to apply the rational model\nto a two-dimensional system of 18 fermions with repulsive interactions, for which they find an exact numerical\nsolution. Their first results indicate that there are attractive correlations between pairs of fermions, despite the\nunderlying repulsive interaction. Such models might apply to high-temperature superconductivity, in which mutually\nrepulsive electrons have to pair up to flow without resistance. In further work, Dukelsky et. al. [4] propose an exact\ncorrespondence between the solution of the quantum pairing model and a two-dimensional classical electrostatic\nproblem: the trigonometric model can be mapped to an electrostatic problem on a spherical surface, whereas the\nhyperbolic model seems to correspond to a mapping on a more general surface.\nThe new solutions of the pairing models seem to be limited to systems of finite size a necessary condition for\nsolving equations giving exact quantum states. But they can certainly be applied to systems where n is quite\nlarge, from which the extrapolation to infinite n is fairly accurate. The solutions are also restricted to systems at a\ntemperature of absolute zero (\u2212273\u25e6 C), but because the exact solution provides all the quantum states and their\nenergies, any thermodynamic quantity can be calculated at a non-zero temperature by thermal averaging, according\n1\n\n\fto the Boltzmann formula of statistical mechanics. Exact solutions, as well as predicting the particular properties of\na simplified system, can also indicate how good a given approximation is to a many-body system.\nIn all these respects, the models of Dukelsky et. al. are highly welcome. Another useful feature of these models is\nthat they apply equally to boson and fermion systems. All known particles are either fermions (such as electrons) or\nbosons (such as photons), which obey different quantum statistics. As the authors show [1], the rational model may\nhave some bearing on fermion systems, in particular the physics of high-temperature superconductors. In the case of\nboson systems, Dukelsky and Shuck [5] have applied the rational model to the transition of a group of low-temperature\natoms to a Bose-Einstein condensate, a state of matter in which all the atoms share the same quantum state. In\nsimilar work, Dukelsky and Pittel [6] applied the model to a system of bosons with short-range repulsive interactions,\nand obtained new evidence for the validity of the 'interacting boson model' of nuclear physics.\nThe physics of strongly correlated fermion systems is one area of active research that should benefit immediately\nfrom these new families of exactly solvable models. Despite considerable theoretical efforts, mainly motivated by the\nproblems raised by high-temperature superconductivity, such systems remain a huge challenge to theorists. These,\nand other seemingly intractable problems, would welcome any insight offered by a new family of theoretical tools.\nThe results obtained by Dukelsky et. al. [1] for a two-dimensional system of fermions with repulsive interactions is a\nfirst step in this direction.\nMichel H\u00e9ritier is in the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides d'Orsay, Centre Scientifique d'Orsay, 91405 Orsay,\nFrance.\ne-mail: heritier@lps.u-psud.fr\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nDukelsky, J., Esebbag, C. & Schuck, P.
