Theoretical calculations of heavy quark\nproduction within the perturbative Quantum ChromoDynamics (pQCD) framework are considered more reliable because the heavy quark mass sets a natural scale for\nthe pQCD. Charm quark production is sensitive to the\nincoming parton flux for the initial conditions of nuclear\ncollisions [1][2]. The transport dynamics of the heavy\nquarks in nuclear medium such as flow [3] and energy\nloss [4][5] can probe QCD properties of the dense matter\ncreated in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Therefore, heavy\nquark measurements provide unique insights into QCD\nproperties of the new state of matter produced in nucleusnucleus collisions.\nThe heavy quark production in p+p or p+A collisions\nprovides a reference for heavy meson formation and for\nnuclear modification factors of heavy quarks in the nuclear medium. The Peterson function [6]\nD(z\u2261pD /pc )\u221d\n\n1\nz[1 \u2212 1/z \u2212 \u03b5/(1 \u2212 z)]2\n\n(1)\n\nhas often been used to describe the charm fragmentation function, where the parameter \u01eb \u2248 0.05 (default\nin PYTHIA [7]) is in reasonable agreement with the\nresults from fits to charm production in e+ e\u2212 and \u03b3p\ncollisions [8]. However, in charm hadroproduction, it\nwas observed that the c-quark pT distributions of nextto-leading-order (NLO) pQCD calculations agree well\nwith the measured open charm pT spectrum [9], indicating that a much harder fragmentation function peaked\nat z \u2248 1 in Eq. 1 is needed in charm hadroproduction. A more detailed discussion of this observation\ncan be found in [10][11]. Coalesence [12][13] or recombination [14][15][16] models have also been proposed for\ncharmed meson formation by combining a charm quark\nwith a light up or down quark, presumably of soft pT [17].\n\nThus the charmed hadron pT would coincide with the\nbare charm quark pT distribution in this hadronization\nscheme. These various hadron formation schemes can\nlead to significantly different charmed meson pT distribution when interpreting non-photonic electron pT spectra\nfrom experimental measurements.\nRecently STAR and PHENIX collaborations have observed a suppression of non-photonic electrons much\nlarger than predicted in the pT \u223c 4 \u2212 8 GeV/c region [18][19]. This observation challenges theoretical predictions based on energy loss via induced gluon radiation for heavy quarks [20][21]. The fact that the relative\ncontributions of D and B meson semi-leptonic decays to\nthe experimental non-photonic electron spectrum is currently not measured at RHIC severely restricts the understanding of the heavy quark energy loss. A nonzero nonphotonic electron v2 has been measured in the pT < 2.0\nGeV/c region, while at higher pT the v2 is observed to decrease with pT [22]. Quantitative understanding of this\nfeature in heavy quark measurements requires relative\ncharm and bottom contributions to non-photonic electrons.\nIn this paper we evaluate the pT distribution of\nD mesons from PYTHIA v6.22 [7] and compare the\nPYTHIA results with the STAR measurements [23][24].\nThe charm quark fragmentation function will be modified from the default Peterson function and the other\nPYTHIA parameters are tuned in order to describe the\nexperimental D meson data as well as the STAR nonphotonic electron spectra [18]. We study the correlations\nbetween non-photonic electrons and charged hadrons in\norder to guide the experimental investigations of the relative contributions to the non-photonic electron spectrum\nat high pT from B and D meson decays.\nFig. 1 shows charm quark and D0 meson spectra\nfrom PYTHIA calculations and NLO pQCD predictions\nfor charm quark spectra [25] together with the STAR\nD0 spectrum [23], where the measured D0 data points\n\n\f2\n\nNLO c-quark with GRV98 HO\n\nNLO c-quark with GRV98 HO\n\nNLO c-quark with MRST HO\n\nPYTHIA D with parp(67)=4 Default (\u03b5 = 0.05)\n0\n-5\nPYTHIA D with parp(67)=4 Modified (\u03b5 = 10 )\n0\nPYTHIA D with parp(67)=1 Default (\u03b5 = 0.05)\n0\n-5\nPYTHIA D with parp(67)=1 Modified (\u03b5 = 10 )\n\nNLO c-quark with MRST HO\n\nPYTHIA c-quark with parp(67)=4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nPYTHIA c-quark with parp(67)=1\n\n10-4\n10-5\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10-4\n10-6\n\n10-8\n10-9\n10-10\n\nSTAR d+Au D (from K\u03c0)\n\nSTAR d+Au D (from K\u03c0)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFONLL uncertainty band\n\nPYTHIA B->e\n\nPYTHIA B->e\n\nPYTHIA D->e\n\nPYTHIA D->e\n\nPYTHIA Sum of D/B->e\n\nPYTHIA Sum of D/B->e\n\nSTAR EMC p+p\n\nSTAR EMC p+p\n\nparp(67)=1\n\nparp(67)=4\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\n10\n\n-6\n\nFONLL uncertainty band\n\n0\n\n1/2\u03c0d2N/p dp dy (GeV/c)-2\n\n10-2\n\nT\n\n1/2\u03c0d2N/p dp dy (GeV/c)-2\n\n10-1\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10-10\n10-12\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nPT (GeV/c)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Charm quark (left) and D0 (right)\nspectra from PYTHIA calculations compared with next-toleading-order pQCD predictions for charm quark spectra and\nthe STAR measured D0 spectrum from d+Au collisions scaled\nby Nbin = 7.5.\n\n\u221a\nfrom d+Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV have been\nscaled by Nbin = 7.5 \u2013 the number of binary collisions.\nThe PYTHIA spectra have been scaled to the measured\ndN/dy of 0.028 \u00b1 0.004(stat.)\u00b10.008(syst.) [23] for D0 at\nmid-rapidity, where the scaling factors are 1.75 for D0\nmeson spectra and 1.25 for charm quark spectra, respectively. The theoretical curve with the MRST HO PDF\nhas been normalized to the measured total cc cross section (1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 0.4mb) [23] by a factor of 3.4.\nThe stars in the left panel of Fig. 1 depict the\ncharm quark pT distribution from a PYTHIA calculation with the following parameters (set I) from reference [26]: PARP(67) = 1 (factor multiplied to Q2 ) ,\n< kt >= 1.5GeV /c, mc = 1.25GeV /c2, Kf actor = 3.5,\nMSTP(33) = 1 (inclusion of K factors), MSTP(32) =\n4 (Q2 scale) and CTEQ5L PDF. We further tuned the\nvalue of PARP(67) to 4, which enhances c-quark production probability through gluon splitting and is introduced\nto take into account higher order effects in the pQCD calculation [27]. The results are shown as triangles in the\nleft panel of Fig. 1. We found that this change mainly\naffects c-quark production at high pT and can effectively\nreproduce the NLO pQCD calculation. We will refer to\nthis set of parameters as parameter set II in the rest of\nthe paper.\nWe compared the charm quark spectra from PYTHIA\ncalculations to the STAR published D0 spectrum [23]\ntogether with the STAR preliminary D\u2217 spectrum [24].\nThe combination of STAR measured D\u2217 and D0 meson spectra into a single D meson spectrum is hampered by the large uncertainties in the ratio D\u2217 /D0 =\n0.4 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.13 [24] which is experimentally not well\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10 2\nPT (GeV/c)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Electron spectra from PYTHIA calculations with the modified Peterson function for charm quarks\nand beauty quarks compared with background subtracted single electron spectrum measured by STAR from p+p collisions\nand the prediction for theoretical uncertainty electron band.\nLeft panel: The spectra are from parameter set II. Right\npanel: The spectra are from parameter set I.\n\nknown at RHIC. The STAR D meson spectrum covers\na limit pT range and is not well constrained at high pT .\nWithout further tuning other PYTHIA parameters, we\nfind that the generated bare charm quark spectra from\nPYTHIA calculations using parameter set I and parameter set II approximately match the STAR D meson pT\ndistribution. As demonstrated in the left panel of Fig. 1,\nthe PYTHIA calculation with parameter set II also yields\na charm quark pT distribution similar to the NLO pQCD\ncalculations [25][28], which coincides with the STAR D\nmeson pT spectrum as well. It is not the purpose of\nthis paper to show that the PYTHIA calculations with\nthese two parameter sets and NLO pQCD calculations\nare equivalent in physics contents.\nIn the right panel of Fig. 1 the D0 pT distribution\nfrom PYTHIA calculations using the default Peterson\nfragmentation function is shown as open circles for parameter set II and crosses for parameter set I. The default\nPeterson function refers to the value of the parameter \u03b5 in\nPeterson function being 0.05 for charm quarks and 0.005\nfor beauty quarks. The default Peterson fragmentation\nfor charm quarks is too soft to reproduce the measured\nD0 spectrum [23] together with D\u2217 spectrum [24]. We\nmodified the value of the parameter \u03b5 to 10\u22125 for both\ncharm and beauty quarks. In this case the fragmentation\nfunction is nearly \u03b4(1 \u2212 z). The results are shown as stars\nfor parameter set I and triangles for parameter set II in\nthe right panel of Fig. 1.

Dashed lines show electrons from D meson decays.\n\nWhile the kT broadening can make the charm pT distribution harder at low beam energies [11], the intrinsic\nkT has little effect on the pT distribution at RHIC energies [25]. A harder fragmentation function is needed for\nthe hadronization of charm quarks if the pQCD calculation is to describe the measured STAR data.\nThe STAR independent measurements of the reconstructed D0 meson and single electrons from heavy quark\nsemi-leptonic decays measured with TOF and TPC are\nconsistent [23]. The electron measurement there only\ncovers up to pT < 4 GeV/c and has no sensitivity to the\nB meson contribution. We also checked the consistency\nbetween D meson data and non-photonic single electron\ndata in p+p collisions within our PYTHIA calculations.\nFig. 2 shows the electron spectra from PYTHIA calculations using the modified Peterson fragmentation function\nfor charm quarks and beauty quarks with parameter set\nII in the left panel and parameter set I in the right panel.\nThe parameters for beauty quarks in set II and set I are\nall the same as for charm quarks except mb = 4.8GeV /c2 .\nThe PYTHIA spectra of electrons from charm meson\ndecays are scaled by the same factor used to scale the\nPYTHIA D0 spectra to the measured dN/dy(D0 ) at midrapidity. The electron spectra from beauty meson decays\nare normalized by the ratio of \u03c3bb\u0304 /\u03c3cc\u0304 based on the NLO\npQCD calculation [29]. The band corresponds to the\ntheoretical uncertainty of this ratio (0.45% - 0.60%) [29],\nwhere the theoretical error may be an underestimate according to recent calculations [28]. We used the value\nat the center of this range to calculate the sum of the\nelectrons.

The FONLL prediction of electron spectrum gives a fair description of the\nshape of the measured spectra. But there is a discrepancy\nin the overall scale and the FNOLL calculation is significant below the STAR data at high pT . More discussions\ncan be found in [18]. The PYTHIA calculations with parameter set II and modified heavy quark fragmentation\nfunction can simultaneously describe the STAR direct\nD meson pT distribution [23][24] and the STAR EMC\nnon-photonic electron data [18]. This modified scheme\nindicates that the contribution of electrons from B meson decays is not dominant for the measured pT region\nup to 8 GeV/c assuming \u03c3bb\u0304 /\u03c3cc\u0304 \u223c 0.45% \u2212 0.60% based\non NLO pQCD calculation. The measurement of electron pT distribution alone has a reduced sensitivity to the\npT distribution of D mesons as shown in reference [30].\nWithin the statistical and systematic errors of the electron data, the PYTHIA calculation with parameter set\nI and the modified Peterson function for both c and b\nquarks can yield an electron pT distribution similar to\nthe measurement [18]. In this case, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2, electrons from b quark decays are not\nthe dominant source for the pT region up to 6 GeV/c. It\nis critical that the B and D meson decay contributions to\nnon-photonic electrons to be separated experimentally.\nWe have studied the azimuthal correlations between\nheavy quark semi-leptonic decay electrons and inclusive\ncharged hadrons. Fig. 3 shows the \u2206\u03c6 distributions\nbetween non-photonic electrons and inclusive charged\nhadrons, with different electron trigger pT cuts and the\nassociated hadron pT > 0.1 GeV/c. The distributions are\nscaled by the number of electron triggers. These plots are\nfrom PYTHIA calculation with parameter set II and the\nmodified heavy quark fragmentation function.

As\ndemonstrated in Fig. 3, there is a significant difference\nbetween B and D meson decays in the near-side correlations. The width of near-side peak for electrons from\nD decays is much narrower than those for the B decays.\nThe wide width from B meson decays is due to the larger\nenergy release (Q value) in the B meson semi-leptonic\ndecays leading to a broad angular correlation between\ndaughter hadrons and electrons. An electron at high pT ,\nif it is from B meson decays, the B meson does not have\nto be at high transverse momentum because the electron\ncan get large momentum from the b-quark mass. In the\ncase of D meson decays, the D meson needs to have a\nlarge momentum in order to boost the daughter electron\nto a high pT . In experimental effort we cannot differentiate heavy quark decay hadrons from others, we used\ninclusive hadrons in our correlation study. We found the\ndifference in the near-side correlations between D decays\nand B decays is largely due to the decay kinematics, not\nthe production dynamics. This difference can help us estimate the relative B and D contributions to the yields\nfor non-photonic electrons.\nThe bottom contribution to the non-photonic electrons\ncan be determined directly from the electron spectra in\nPYTHIA. The results are given in the second column of\nTable I. However, this way to determine the bottom contribution is not experimentally feasible. In order to experimentally determine the bottom contribution fraction,\nwe use the \u2206\u03c6 distributions for B decays and D decays\nto fit the \u2206\u03c6 distribution for PYTHIA inclusive case (either B decays or D decays), and let the B contribution\nfraction as a parameter. The fraction is determined by\nthe minimum value of \u03c72 . And the fitting error is determined by one \u03c3 shift of \u03c72 /ndf from the minimum value.\nThe fitting error will reduce by increasing the statistics.\nThe results are shown in the third column of Table I.\nThe results are consistent with those directly from the\nelectron spectra. This indicates that the method we proposed is self-consistent. This approach can be used to\nexperimentally estimate the B and D contributions to\nthe non-photonic electrons.\n\nWe further studied the particle production within a\ncone around triggered high pT electrons from heavy quark\ndecays. We focused on the scalar summed pT distributions of inclusive charged hadrons in the cone (pT\nrefers to the transverse momentum in the laboratory\nframe). Here the cone is defined by |\u03b7h \u2212 \u03b7e | < 0.35\nand |\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6e | < 0.35 (\u03b7 is pseudorapidity and \u03c6 is azimuthal angle). The summed pT distributions of inclusive charged hadrons in three triggered electron pT ranges\nare shown in Fig. 4. The distributions are scaled to unit.\nThe dashed lines are for D decays and the solid lines are\nfor B decays. These plots are from PYTHIA calculation with parameter set II and the modified heavy quark\nfragmentation function. We also can see that there is\na significant difference between B decays and D decays.\nThe summed pT distributions for D meson decays are\nmuch wider than those for B meson decays. This difference can also be used to distinguish B and D decay\ncontributions. We use the summed pT histograms from\nB decays and D decays to fit the summed pT histogram\nfrom PYTHIA inclusive case to determine the B decay\ncontribution. The results are shown in Table II. The results are consistent with those directly from the electron\nspectra. The ratios for the same trigger pT ranges are\ndifferent between Table II and Table I. It is because we\nremoved those electrons which have no hadrons in the\ncone around them when we calculated the bottom contribution from the electron spectra for Table II. This\nremoves different fractions from B and D decays, which\nhas to be corrected by simulations. This was done to\nmake the results directly from the electron spectra comparable to the results from hadron summed pT histogram\nfitting. It will be more valuable for the small acceptance\nexperiments to investigate the B decay contribution using summed pT histogram fitting.\nIn conclusion, we found that in order to match the\nSTAR measured pT shape of D mesons from d+Au collisions at RHIC using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, a harder charm quark fragmentation function must\nbe used. Since the D meson production at high pT is\nnot well constrained by the STAR data and the measurement of electrons alone has a reduced sensitivity on\nthe pT shape of D mesons, PYTHIA calculations with\nparameter set I and set II can simultaneously describe\nthe pT distributions of D mesons and non-photonic electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy quarks. These\n\n\f5\ncalculations predict that the beauty quark decay electrons are not a dominant contribution over the entire pT\nregion up to 6-8 GeV/c depending on parameters. The\nrelative contributions to non-photonic electrons from B\nand D decays have to be determined experimentally. We\nstudied the correlations of non-photonic electrons and inclusive charged hadrons, which can distinguish between\nD and B decay contributions to the non-photonic electrons due to their different decay kinematics. We have\nproposed an experimental method to estimate the relative D and B decay contributions.\nThe author wishes to thank An Tai, Huan Z.
