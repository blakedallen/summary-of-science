Besides, in highly correlated states\nin condensed matter systems such as superconductors1,2 ,\nfractional quantum Hall liquids3 , the entanglement serves\nas a unique measure of quantum correlations between degrees of freedom. In quantum many-body systems such\nas spin, fermion and boson systems,the entanglement is\nconnected to the phase diagram of the physical systems.\nNon-analytic behavior of entanglement close to the quantum critical point of the system and occurrence of finite\nsize scaling have provided an intense research leading to\nfresh our insight of the critical properties from the quantum information side, for a comprehensive discussion see\nthe review by L. Amico, et al.4 and references therein.\nIn the past years the appearance of new phases of matter has intensified the investigation of the entanglement\nin the quantum systems. These are phases beyond the\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm5 where an appropriate local order parameter characterizes different behaviors of two phases on either side of the critical point.\nThese new phases of matter carries a kind of quantum\norder called topological order 6 and the transition among\nvarious phases does not depend on the symmetry breaking mechanism. Therefore the Landau theory of classical\nphase transition fails in order to describe these phases.\nGround state of such phases is a highly entangled state\nand the excitations above the ground state have a topological nature which mirrored in their exotic statistics.\nAmong the models with topological properties, the Kitaev or toric code7 has been extensively studied. Ground\n\nstate degeneracy depends on the genus or handles of the\nmanifold where the model is defined on, and there is a\ngap which separated the ground state subspace from the\nexcited states. The ground state degeneracy can not be\nlifted by any local perturbations which underlines the\nKitaev's model as a testground for fault-tolerant quantum computations7 . The ground state of the Kitaev's\nmodel is indeed stabilized by group generated by a set\nof local operators called plaquette and star operators\nmaking it useful as a quantum error correcting code8 .\nThe information is encoded in the ground state subspace\nwhich is topologically protected making it robust as a\nquantum memory9 . For this model any bipartition of\nthe lattice has non-zero entanglement which manifests\nthe ground state is generically multipartite entangled10 .\nBipartite entanglement scales with the boundary of the\nsubsystem showing that the entanglement between two\nparts of the system depend only on the degrees of freedom living on the boundary which is a manifestation of\nthe holographic character of the entanglement entropy11 .\nFor topological models a satisfactory connection\nbetween topological order and entanglement content of a\nmodel has been established via introducing the concept\nof the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) 12,13\nwhich is a universal quantity with topological nature.\nAnother resource with topological protection character is called color code. An interplay between color and\nhomology provides some essential features, for example\na particular class of two-dimensional color codes with\ncolored borders will suppress the need for selective addressing to qubits through implementation of Clifford\ngroup14 .The number of logical qubits which are encoded\nby a two dimensional color code are twice than the toric\ncode15 defined on the compact surface.\n\n\f2\nIn this paper we study the entanglement properties of a\ncolor code defined on a two-dimensional lattice, the so\ncalled 2-colex16 . We consider different bipartitions of the\nlattice and evaluate the entanglement entropy between\nthem. The connection between the topological nature of\nthe code and the entanglement entropy is also discussed.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In sec(II) the\nbasic notions of a color code on the surface has been introduced. In sec(III) based on the stabilizer structure\nof the protected code space the reduced density matrix\nwhich is needed for evaluating the entanglement entropy\nhas been calculated. Then in sec(IV) the entanglement\nentropy for different bipartitions is calculated. In sec(V)\nanother class of color code on plane and its entanglement\nproperties are introduced, and the final section (VI) has\nbeen devoted to the conclusions.\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES ON TOPOLOGICAL\nCOLOR CODE\n\nfundamental cycles of the manifold in which the lattice is\ndefined on and have a character of color. Number of these\nclosed loops depends on the genus of the manifold where\nthe lattice defined on. For the torus with g = 1 there\nare two such cycles which are non-contractible loops in\ncontrary to the closed boundary strings which are homotopic to the boundary of a plaquette. For the topological color codes these non-contractible loops are shown in\nFig.(1). For every homology class of the torus there are\ntwo closed strings each of one color, say red and blue.\nRed string connects red plaquettes and so on. Note that\na generic string, say green, can be produced by product\nof the red and blue strings when they are suitably chosen. In fact since every Pauli matrix squares identity, at\na vertex (qubit) which two homologous strings cross each\nother they cancel each other. Indeed there is an interplay\nbetween color and homology class of the model. One can\ndefine a nontrivial closed string as follows:\nO\nS\u03bcC\u03a9 =\n\u03a9i ,\n(2)\ni\u2208I\n\nIn this paper we consider a class of topological quantum error-correction code defined on the lattice, the so\ncalled topological color codes (TCC)14 . The local degrees\nof freedom are spin-1/2 with the bases of the Hilbert\nspace C 2 . The lattice we consider composed of vertices,\nlinks and plaquettes. Each vertex stands for a local\nspin. Three links meet each other at a vertex and no\ntwo plaquettes with same color share the same link. We\nsuppose this color structure is denoted by the notation\nTCC{V,E,P } where the V,E,P denote the set of vertices, edges and plaquettes, respectively. For simplicity\nwe define the model on the regular hexagonal lattice on\nthe torus, i.e imposing periodic boundary conditions as\nshown in Fig.(1). There is a subspace C \u2282 H which is\ntopologically protected. The full structure of this subspace and its properties are determined by definition of\nstabilizer group. The stabilizer group is generated by a\nset of plaquette operators. For each plaquette we attach\nthe following operators which are product of a set of Pauli\noperators of vertices around a plaquette:\nO\n\u03a9C\n\u03a9C\np =\nv ; \u03a9 = X, Z , C = Red, Green, Blue. (1)\nv\u2208p\n\nFor a generic plaquette, say blue plaquette P1 in\nFig.(1) we can identify green and red strings which are\nthe boundary of the plaquette. It is natural to think of\nproduct of different plaquette operators which may produce a collection of boundary operators. For example as\nis shown in Fig.(1) the product of two neighboring plaquettes, say red and blue ones, correspond to a green\nstring P2 which is a boundary of two plaquettes. All\nstring operators produced in this way are closed. Since\nall closed strings share either nothing or even number of\nvertices, they commute with each other and with plaquettes . In addition to closed boundary operators, there\nare other closed string which are no longer the product\nof the plaquette operators. These closed string form the\n\nwhere I indexed the set of spins on a generic string, \u03bc\nstands for the homology class of the torus and \u03a9 is the X\nor Z Pauli spin operators. Closed non-contractible loops\nturn on to form bases for the encoded logical operators of\ntopological code. To more clarify this, we label different\nloops as:\nX1 \u2190\u2192 S2RX , X2 \u2190\u2192 S1BX , X3 \u2190\u2192 S2BX , X4 \u2190\u2192 S1RX ,\n\nZ1 \u2190\u2192 S1BZ , Z2 \u2190\u2192 S2RZ , Z3 \u2190\u2192 S1RZ , Z4 \u2190\u2192 S2BZ .(3)\nThese operators form a 4-qubit algebra in H24 , so it\nmanifests a 16-dimensional subspace for the coding space\nC which is topologically protected. On the other hand,\nthe topological color code on the torus with g = 1 encodes\nfour qubits. Now we move to construct the explicit form\nof the states of the subspace C.\nThe above construction for the string operators in Eq.(3)\ncan be extended to an arbitrary manifold with genus g.\nFor such manifold the coding space spanned with 24g\nvectors. Note that for toric code (white and dark code)15\nwhen is embedded in the same manifold with genus g, the\ncoding space will span with 22g vectors10 which explicitly\nshows that the color codes have richer structure than the\ntoric codes15 .\n\nA.\n\nStabilizer Formalism\n\nThe protected subspace C is spanned by the state\nvectors which are stabilized by all element of stabilizer\ngroup, i.e. a subset of Pauli group. Let U be a set of\ngenerators of the stabilizer group and its elements are\ndenoted by M. So this subspace is\n\n\f3\nas the centralizer of G in Pauli group. Since elements\nof Pauli group either commute or anticommute, the centralizer is actually equal to the normalizer of G in Pauli\ngroup. Considering the non-contractible loops, the normalizer of stabilizer group can be obtained by product of\nstabilizer group and group of non-contractible loop operators. Let denote it by \u1e20 = A * G where the group A\ngenerated by non-contractible loop operators, i.e.\n\u03bc=2g\nY\n\nA={\n\n(S\u03bcCX )r\u03bcc , r\u03bcc = 0, 1} .\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bc=1,C=B,R\n\nSo, the group \u1e20 reads\n\u03bc=2g\nY\n\n\u1e20 = {\n\n(S\u03bcCX )r\u03bcc * G , r\u03bcc = 0, 1} .\n\n(7)\n\n\u03bc=1,C=B,R\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) A piece of 2-colex which has been defined on the hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Lightest to darkest hexagons: green, red and blue,\nrespectively. All circles stand for qubits living at the vertices. A hexagon (P1 ), say blue, can be denoted by either\nred or green closed boundary string and the product of two\nneighboring plaquettes, say red and blue, corresponds to a\ngreen string (P2 ). Non-contractible loops (X1 ,X2 ,X3 ,X4 ) for\ntopological color codes which determine the structure of the\nencoded subspace C. A colored string connect plaquettes with\nthe same color.\n\nNote that G \u2286 \u1e20. The group \u1e20 is the normalizer of\nG in Pauli group, so the normal subgroup G divides the\ngroup \u1e20 into 24g cosets. The cardinality of group will\nbe |\u1e20| = 2|P |+4g\u22122 . Therefore the protected subspace\nC is spanned by 24g states which correspond to different\ncosets. In fact, elements in \u1e20 \u2212 G take one encoded\nstate of the stabilized subspace to another encoded state\nwithout leaving the stabilized subspace. For the states\nof the stabilized subspace we have, by construction:\nC = { |ijkli :\n\nC = {|\u03c8i :\n\nM|\u03c8i = |\u03c8i \u2200M \u2208 U} .\n\n(4)\n\nLet G be the group constructed by the generators of\nspin-flip plaquette operators, i.e XpC . The cardinality of\nthe group is then |G| = 2|P |\u22122 where |P | stands for the\ntotal number of plaquettes. Note that all plaquettes are\nnot independent since the product of all plaquettes with\nthe sameQcolor represents\nthe same\nQ action inNthe group,\nQ\nnamely R XpC = B XpC = G XpC = X |V | where\n|V | stands for the number of all vertices.\nBy starting from\nN\nan initial vacuum state, say |0i |V | where Z|0i = |0i,\none can construct a state vector in the Hilbert space\nwhich is stabilized by the group elements. This state\nvector is a superposition of all elements of the stabilizer\ngroup with equal weights. From the previous arguments,\nit is convenient to denote it by |0000i which has the following form\nX\nN\n|0000i = |G|\u22121/2\ng|0i |V | ,\n(5)\n\n|ijkli = X1i X2j X3k X4l |0000i },\n\n(8)\n\nwhere X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 are defined in Eq.(3) and i, j, k, l =\n0, 1. These topological non-trivial string operators can\ntake one state of the coding space to another one, and\nany error of this type will not be detectable. A generic\nstate can be a superposition of different vectors of coding\nspace as follows:\n|\u03a8i =\n\nX\n\nai,j,k,l |ijkli\n\n,\n\ni,j,k,l\n\nB.\n\nX\n\n|ai,j,k,l |2 = 1 . (9)\n\ni,j,k,l\n\nProtected Subspace as a Ground State Subspace\n\nFrom the practical point of view it is important to find\na state of quantum many-body system for implementation of universal quantum computation. We can provide\na construction in which the protected subspace be the\nground sate of a local Hamiltonian17 . The subspace C is\nthe ground state of a following exactly solvable Hamiltonian , i.e.\n\ng\u2208G\n\nwhere\nNthe g ris an element of the stabilizing group, i.e\ng = p\u2208P Xp p where rp = 0(1) corresponds to the plaquette operator Xp appearing (not appearing) in the element group g. There are many elements of the Pauli\ngroup that commute with the all elements of the stabilizer group but are not actually in G, and it is defined\n\nH=\u2212\n\nX\np\u2208P\n\nXp \u2212\n\nX\n\nZp .\n\n(10)\n\np\u2208P\n\nThe ground state of this Hamiltonian is 24g -fold degenerate and topologically protected from local errors. Different states of the ground state subspace as it is clear\n\n\f4\nfrom Eq.(8) are obtained by product of non-contractible\ncolored strings. Each state is characterized by a set\nof topological numbers which are sum of all zv modula 2 along non-contractible loops. For example for a\ngeneric\nin Eq.(8) the topological\nnumbers\nP\nP state |ijkli P\nz\n=\nk and\nz\n=\nj,\nz\n=\ni,\nare\nR\nR\nB\nv\u2208I1 v\nv\u2208I2 v\nv\u2208I1 v\nP\nv\u2208I2B zv = l, where the summations are evaluated in\nmod 2, zv stands for the z-component of Z-Pauli matrix\nof vertex v and I\u03bcC identifies a set of vertices (qubits) on\na closed non-contractible loop with homology \u03bc and color\nC. An excited state will arise when any of the stabilizing\nconditions in Eq.(4) is violated. In the energy unit which\nis defined by Hamiltonian Eq.(10), the first excited state\nwill be separated from the ground state by a gap of value\n2.\nIII.\n\nary operators. We focus on the entanglement entropy\nbetween two partitions A and B of the system. To this\nend, first the reduced density operator of the one subsystem is evaluated and then the entanglement entropy is\nmeasured. If the state of the system is in an equal superposition of the elements of group G, the reduced density\nmatrix for a subsystem, say A, has the following form10\n\n\u03c1A =\n\ndB\n|G|\n\nX\n\nSA = log2 |GAB |\n\nIV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT OF TCC FOR VARIOUS\nBIPARTITIONS\n\nIn this section we design different spin configurations\nas subsystems and then evaluate their entanglement with\nits complementary.\nOne Spin\n\nAs first example we consider the entanglement between\none spin and remaining ones of the lattice. In this case\nthere is no closed boundary operators acting exclusively\non the spin, i.e subsystem A. So the reduced density matrix \u03c1A is diagonal as follows:\n\u03c1A = f \u22121\n\nX\ng\u2208G/GB\n\ngA |0A ihA 0|gA\n\n(14)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere f = |G/GB | is the number of operators which\nact freely on the subsystem A. As it is clear there are\nthree plaquette operators which act freely on one spin\nsince every spin in the color code is shared by the three\nplaquettes (See Fig.(1)). This leads to f = 23 = 8. Only\nhalf of operators of quotient group leading to flip the spin,\ni.e. they will have trivial effect unless three plaquettes act\neither individually or altogether. Therefore the reduced\ndensity matrix is\n\n\u03c1A =\nA.\n\n(12)\n\nwhere GAB = GAGGB . It is a simple task to show that all\nstates of the coding space have the same entanglement\nentropy. To show this, let X(t) = X1i X2j X3k X4l in which\nt = (i, j, k, l) is a binary vector. So, for a generic state\nin the coding space we have: |ti = X(t)|0i. Moreover\nthe string\nN operators X(t) can be decomposed as X(t) =\nX(t)A X(t)B . Therefore we obtain\n\n\u03c1A (|ti) = T rB (|tiht|) = T rB (X(t)|0ih0|X(t)) = X(t)A T rB (|0ih0|)X(t)A = X(t)A \u03c1A (|0i)X(t)A .\n\nThis implies that, by using the ancilla SA (t) =\nlimn\u21921 \u2202n T r[\u03c1nA ], the entanglement entropy for a state\n|ti is SA (t) = SA (0).\n\n(11)\n\nwhere GA and GB are subgroups of G which act trivially\non subsystems B and A, respectively and dA and dB are\ntheir cardinality. So the von Neumann entropy is\n\nREDUCED DENSITY MATRIX AND VON\nNEUMANN ENTROPY\n\nIn this section we turn on to calculate the entanglement properties of the topological color codes. We consider a generic bipartition of the system into subsystems\nA and B. Let \u03a3A and \u03a3B to be the number of plaquette operators acting solely on A and B, respectively, and\nlet \u03a3AB to stand for the number of plaquette operators\nacting simultaneously on A and B, i.e these are bound-\n\ngA |0A ihA 0|gA g\u0303A\n\ng\u2208G/GB ,\u03c1\u0303\u2208GA\n\n1\n(|1A ihA 1| + |0A ihA 0|).\n2\n\n(15)\n\nThus, in topological color code every spin is maximally\nentangled with other spins. For the surface code (Kitaev\nmodel) a single spin is also maximally entangled with\nother spins10 .\nB.\n\nTwo Spins\n\nWe calculate the entanglement between two spins. For\nthis case also there is not any closed boundary operator\n\n\f5\nwith nontrivial effect on two spins, so the reduced density\nmatrix reads\n\n\u03c1A =\n\n1\n(|11ih11| + |10ih10| + |01ih01| + |00ih00|). (16)\n4\n\nThe entanglement between two spins which is measured by the Concurrence18 vanishes. While each spin\nis maximally entangled with others, two spins are not\nentangled which is a manifestation of the fact that the\ntopological color code is genuinely multipartite entangled\nlike the surface codes.\n\nspin chain only able to flip even number of spins of the\nchain. The same arguments can be applied for other\nground states |ijkli where for all of them the entanglement entropy is given by Eq.(18). By inspection of other\nground states we see that there are 23 = 8 state in which\neven number of spins in the spin chain have been flipped.\nThese states are\n|0000i , X1 |0000i , X3 |0000i , X4 |0000i , X1 X3 |0000i,\n\nX1 X4 |0000i , X3 X4 |0000i , X1 X3 X4 |0000i.\nC.\n\nColored Spin Chain\n\nIn this case we aim to know how much a closed colored\nspin chain winding the torus nontrivially, say blue or red\nin Fig.(1) is entangled with rest of the lattice. For the\nsake of clarity and without loss of generality we consider\na hexagonal lattice with |P | = 3k \u00d7 4k plaquettes, where\nk is an integer number as 1, 2, 3..., for example in Fig.(1)\nk = 2. This choice makes the color code more symmetric.\nSo, the number of plaquettes with a specific color, say\nred, is (2k)2 , and the number of spins that the colored\nchain contains is 4k. Let the system be in the |0000i.\nFor this state there is not any closed boundary which\nexclusively acts on the chain. Therefor the reduce density\nmatrix is diagonal and the number of plaquette operators\nwhich act independently on the subsystem B is\n\u03a3B = (|P | \u2212 2) \u2212 (3 \u00d7 2k) + (2k + 1)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the third term is the number of constrains on the\nplaquette operators acting on spin chain. In fact these\nare collective operators, i.e product of boundary plaquette operators between A and B which act solely on B.\nWith these remarks in hand, the entanglement entropy\nbecomes\n|G|\n= 4k \u2212 1 .\nSA = log\ndB\n\n(18)\n\nIt is instructive to compare the obtained entanglement\nentropy in Eq.(18) with the entanglement of the spin\nchain in the Kitaev's model. For the latter case when\nthe model defined on the square lattice on a compact surface, i.e torus, there exists a rather similar scaling with\nthe number of qubits living in the chain10 .\nIn both cases the entanglement entropy in Eq.(18) can\nbe understood from the fact that only configurations with\neven number of spin flips of the chain allow in the ground\nstate structure. Plaquettes which are free to act on the\n\n(19)\n\nBesides, there are 23 = 8 states with an odd number\nof spin flipped for the spin chain which have been listed\nbelow:\nX2 |0000i ,\n\nX2 X1 |0000i ,\n\nX2 X3 |0000i,\n\nX2 X4 |0000i , X2 X1 X3 |0000i , X2 X1 X4 |0000i,\n\nX2 X3 X4 |0000i , X2 X1 X3 X4 |0000i.\n\n(20)\n\nNow we consider a generic state and calculate the entanglement entropy between the colored spin chain and\nrest of the lattice. The density matrix \u03c1 = |\u03a8ih\u03a8| is\nX\n\u03c1=\naijkl \u0101mnpq X1i X2j X3k X4l \u03c10 X1m X2n X3p X4q .(21)\nijkl,mnpq\n\nWith the explanations we made above the eigenvalues\nof the reduced density matrix \u03c1A for the even number of\nspin flipped is as follows:\ndB\n(|a0000 |2 + |a1000 |2 + |a0010 |2 + |a0001 |2 + |a1010 |2\n|G|\n\n+ |a1001 |2 + |a0011 |2 + |a1011 |2 ) =\n\ndB\n\u03b1\n|G|\n\n(22)\n\n4k\u22121\n. Note that the number of these\nwhere |G|\ndB = 2\neigenvalues is 24k\u22121 . Through the similar arguments we\nsee that the eigenvalues of reduced density matrix of the\ndB\nspin chain with odd number of spin flipped is |G|\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n4k\u22121\nand the number of these eigenvalues is 2\n. So, we can\ncalculate the entanglement entropy as follows:\n\n\f6\n\n2\nX\n4k\n\nSA = \u2212\n\n\u03bbi log \u03bbi = \u221224k\u22121\n\ni=1\n\ndB\ndB\ndB\ndB\n\u03b1 log\n\u03b1 \u2212 24k\u22121\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1) log(\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)) = 4k \u2212 1 + H(\u03b1)\n|G|\n|G|\n|G|\n|G|\n\n(23)\n\nwhere H(x) = \u2212x log x \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) log(1 \u2212 x).\nWhat about the entanglement of an open string? the\nopen strings in the color code stand for the errors and\nmap the coding space into an orthogonal one. These open\nstrings anticommute with plaquette operators which\nshare in odd number of vertices. For an open string\nwhich contains k \u2032 qubits the entanglement entropy is:\n\u2032\nSA = log dB|G|\ndA = k , i.e an open string will be maximally\nentangled with rest of the system.\nD.\n\nRed Strings Crossing\n\nAs an another bipartition we select all spins on the two\nred strings with different homologies, say X1 and X4 in\nFig.(1), which have 2 \u00d7 4k = 8k spins. Let system be\nin the |0000i state. There is not any closed boundary\noperator acting solely on A. Considering the total number of independent plaquette operators acting solely on\nsubsystem B, the entanglement entropy then reads\nSA = 8k \u2212 1.\n\n(24)\n\nAgain we see that there are only configurations with\nan even number of spin flipped in the construction of the\nstate |0000i. For a generic state as in Eq.(21) where we\ncan realized all states with either even or odd number of\nspin flips, the entanglement entropy will be\nSA = 8k \u2212 1 + H(\u03b1) .\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) A set of vertical spin ladders (black solid\ncircles) on 2-colex as a subsystem for calculating entanglement\nentropy.\n\nit nontrivially. 8k plaquettes act freely on subsystem A,\nbut there are some constraints on them which arise from\nthe product of plaquettes in which leave the subsystem A\ninvariant and makes collective operator which acts solely\non B. The product of blue and green plaquettes of those\nplaquettes which are free to act on A will produce a red\nstring leaving A invariant. The same product hold for the\nred and green plaquettes. So the entanglement entropy\nreads\n\n(25)\nSA = 8k \u2212 2 .\n\nE.\n\nRed and Blue strings crossing\n\nBy this partition we mean the spins on the X1 and\nX2 strings in Fig.(1). The subsystem A contains 8k \u2212 1\nspins and again there is no closed boundary acting on it.\nEnumerating the independent plaquette operators acting\non the subsystem B, the entanglement entropy is\nSA = 8k \u2212 3 .\nF.\n\n(26)\n\nTwo Parallel Spin Chains\n\nTwo parallel spin chains, say red and blue (X1 and X3 )\nin Fig.(1) or equivalently a green string, contain 2 \u00d7 4k =\n8k spins and again there is not any closed string acting on\n\n(27)\n\nIndeed this is entanglement entropy for a green string.\nHowever, the number of spins it contains is twice than\nthe strings we discussed in Subsec(C).\nG.\n\nSpin Ladder\n\nA set of vertical spin ladders has been shown in Fig.(2).\nIn this subsection only one of them has been considered\nas subsystem A. Let the system be in the state |0000i. In\nthis case the subsystem A contains 2 \u00d7 3k spins, and the\ntotal number on independent plaquette acting on subsystem B is (|P | \u2212 2) \u2212 3 \u00d7 3k + 3k. Since there are not\nany closed string acting solely on A, the entanglement\nentropy reads\nSA = 6k .\n\n(28)\n\n\f7\nedge of the hexagon be n. Now we can enumerate the\nnumber of plaquettes which act on A in terms of n, i.e.\n\u03a3A = 3n(n \u2212 1) + 1. The total number of spins of the\nsubsystem A is 6n2 . There are \u03a3AB = 6n plaquettes\nwhich act between A and B. Let the system be in the\nstate |0000i. With these realizations of the subsystems\nand since |P | = \u03a3A + \u03a3B + \u03a3AB we can turn on to calculate the entanglement entropy between two subsystems\nas follows:\nSA = log2 2\u03a3AB \u22122 = \u03a3AB \u2212 2 = 6n \u2212 2 .\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) A manifestation of a hexagonal disk as\na subsystem. A set of plaquettes is chosen in such a way that\nform a large hexagon (the yellow line), and all large yellow\n(light) spins are in the subsystem . The dashed black line\ndepicts the set of plaquettes acting simultaneously on both\nsubsystems.\n\nSo, it is clear that this spin ladder has maximum entanglement with the rest of the system and its state has\nthe maximum mixing, namely\n\u03c1A = 2\u22126k I6k\u00d76k .\nH.\n\n(29)\n\nVertical Spin Ladders\n\nNow we consider all vertical spin ladders has been depicted in Fig.(2) and again we suppose the system is in\nthe state |0000i. There is not any plaquette operator\nwhich acts solely on subsystem A. However, there are\nseveral specific product of plaquette operators producing\nclosed strings in which act solely on A. For example the\nproduct of plaquettes which are in a vertical column will\nproduce a closed string acting on one of the subsystems.\nBoth subsystems A and B are symmetric with respect to\neach other. So, the number of closed strings which act\nonly on A and B will be dA = dB = 22k . Finally the\nentanglement entropy reads\nSA = 12k 2 \u2212 4k \u2212 2 .\n\nI.\n\n(30)\n\nA Hexagonal Disk\n\nIn this case we adapt a situation in which a set of plaquettes intuitively forms a hexagon as shown in Fig.(3).\nIn this figure the dashed hexagon demonstrates a set\nof plaquettes lying between two subsystems. We suppose that the number of plaquettes crossed by the one\n\n(31)\n\nWe can relate this entropy to the perimeter of the subsystem A by choosing the hight of a plaquette as unit.\nThe perimeter of A is \u2202A = 6n and the entropy then will\nbe\nSA = \u2202A \u2212 2 .\n\n(32)\n\nGenerally for a irregular lattice the entropy for a convex\nshape will be SA = \u03ba\u2202A \u2212 \u03b3 where the coefficient \u03ba is\na nonuniversal constant depending on the shape of the\nregion while the constant \u03b3 = 2 will be universal and\nhas a topological nature. So, we see that the entanglement entropy for the topological color code scales with\nthe boundary of the subsystem which is a manifestation\nof so called area law 11,19,20 .\nThe latter relation for we obtained for the entanglement\nentropy is consistent with derivation of A. Kitaev et al.12\nand M. Levin et al.13 where they proposed for a massive topological phase there is a topological subleading\nterm for the entanglement entropy which is related to the\nquantum dimension of the abelian quasiparticles. The total quantum dimension for the topological color code will\nbe\n\u03b3 = log D ,\n\nD=4.\n\n(33)\n\nThe quantity D2 is the number of topological superselection sectors of abelian anyons. For Kitaev's toric code\nthere are only four such sectors leading to \u03b3 = log 2.\nSo the total quantum dimension in the topological color\ncode is bigger than the toric code. The abelian phase\nof the toric code is characterized via appearing a global\nphase for the wavefunction of the system by winding an\nelectric (magnetic) excitation around a magnetic (electric) excitation12 . In the case of color code the excitations are colored and they appear as end points of open\ncolored strings of a shrunk lattice16 . Winding a colored\nX-type excitation around the Z-type one with different\ncolor gives an overall factor (-) for the wavefunction of\nthe model, i.e the phase is abelian. Therefore the contribution of the color to the excitations makes the abelian\nphase of the color code richer than the toric code with a\nbigger quantum dimension.\nNow let the system be in a generic state such as\nEq.(21). The reduced density matrix then reads\n\n\f8\n\n\u03c1A =\n\nX\n\naijkl \u0101mnpq T rB (X1i X2j X3k X4l \u03c10 X1m X2n X3p X4q ) .\n\n(34)\n\nijkl,mnpq\n\nSome remarks are in order. For two different nontrivial\nclosed string operators but with the same homology and\ncolor , say X and X \u2032 , they will have same support and\nare related via a trivial closed string g \u2208 G, i.e X \u2032 = gX.\nSince [g, X] = 0, two string will have the same effect on\nthe \u03c10 , i.e. X \u2032 \u03c10 = gX\u03c10 = X\u03c10 . We can exploit this\nproperty of string operators in order to choose the strings\nappearing in Eq.(34) in which they do not cross subsys-\n\nT rB (X1 \u03c10 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\ngA |0A ihA 0|gA\n\nX\n\ntem A. Indeed the strings Xi act only on the subsystem\nB, i.e XiA = IA . This leads to T rB (Xi \u03c10 Xi ) = T rB (\u03c10 )\nfor i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and T rB (X1i X2j X3k X4l \u03c10 X1i X2j X3k X4l ) =\nT rB (\u03c10 ) for i, j, k, l = 0, 1. Other cases will be zero.\nTo clarify this, let for example consider the simple case\nT rB (X1 \u03c10 ) where we have\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\nhB 0|gB\nX4 gB |0B ihB 0|gB\ngB |0B i =\n\n\u2032\u2032\ngB\n\ng,g\u2032 \u2208G\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\ngA |0A ihA 0|gA\nhB 0|gB\nXB gB |0B i. (35)\n\ng,g\u2032 \u2208G\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Different bipartitions of the lattice in\norder to drop the bulk and boundary effect through the definition of topological entanglement entropy.\n\nOn the other hand from the group property g \u2032 = gg\u0303\nthe above expression becomes\n\nT rB (X1 \u03c10 ) =\n\nX\n\ngA |0A ihA 0|gA g\u0303A hB 0|g\u0303B XB |0B i (36)\n\ng,g\u0303\u2208G\n\nwhich implies that g\u0303B = XB . Otherwise the above\nexpression will become zero. The fact g\u0303 = g\u0303A \u2297 g\u0303B \u2208 G\nexplicitly implies that the operator g\u0303A must be a noncontractile strings which is impossible since it must act\nsolely on A. So we will leave with T rB (X1 \u03c10 ) = 0. The\nsame arguments may also apply for other cases. Finally\nthe entanglement for a generic state of the system and a\nconvex region will become\n\n\u03c1A = T rB (\u03c10 )\n\n,\n\nSA = \u2202A \u2212 2 .\n\n(37)\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) One of subsystems, say A, composed of\ntwo disjoint regions which introduce some nontrivial colored\nclosed strings acting solely on B. The closed blue and red\nstrings have been shown only for one region of subsystem A.\n\nJ.\n\nTopological Entanglement Entropy\n\nAs we see from the Eq.(32), in the entanglement entropy of a region there exists a subleading term which is\nuniversal and independent of the shape of region. This is\na characteristic signature of topological order which has\nbeen found on the subleading term of the entanglement\nentropy. To be more precise on the topological character\nof subleading term, we can construct a set of bipartitions\n\n\f9\nin which the boundary contribution is dropped and remaining term is stemmed from the topological nature of\nthe code and inspires the topological order. To drop the\nbulk and boundary degrees of freedom we consider a set\nof partitions which have been shown in Fig.(4). Topological entanglement entropy then arises from the following\ncombination of entanglement entropy\nStopo =\n\nlim (\u2212S1A + S2A + S3A \u2212 S4A ) .\n\nR,r\u2192\u221e\n\n(38)\n\nFor each bipartition one can use the entanglement entropy as before, namely SG = log(|G|) \u2212 log(dA dB ). So\nfar the cardinalities dA and dB were determined by the\nnumber of plaquette operators acting solely on A and B,\nrespectively, i.e. dA = 2\u03a3A and dB = 2\u03a3B , where \u03a3B and\n\u03a3B stand for the number of plaquette operators acting\nonly on A and B, respectively. However, for calculating of the Stopo we should take into account other closed\nstrings in addition to the above closed strings acting on\nsubsystems. For the case in which each partition is a single connected region, for example bipartitions (2) and (3)\nin Fig.(4), the previous arguments work, but for disjoint\nregions such as (1) and (4) in Fig.(4) we should extend\nthe above result. As an example a simple case has been\nshown in Fig.(5) where we have supposed the subsystem\nA is composed of two disjoint regions (two dashed rectangles which we label them as A1 and A2 ) while the\nsubsystem B is a single connected one. By inspection we\nsee that the product of two set of plaquettes, say blue\nand green ones, which act on A1 and the blue and green\nones acting simultaneously on A1 and B result in a red\nstring which acts only on B. The same scenario can be\napplied for other choices of the plaquettes, e.g. red and\ngreen or red and blue plaquettes, which yield blue and\ngreen string leaving the subsystem A1 . However, as we\npointed out before one of them will be immaterial since\nthere is an interplay between homology and color.\nThe main point is that it is not possible to produce these\ncolored closed strings which act only on B from the product of some plaquettes of region B. The same thing will\nbe held for the another disjoint region of A, say A2 . So,\nwe have a collection of closed strings with nontrivial effect\non B and we must take into account them in calculation\nof dB . But, a remark is in order and that if for example we combine two red strings, the resultant is not a\nnew closed string because we can produce these two red\nstring from the product of the blue and green plaquettes\nof region B. Therefore for the case shown in Fig.(5) there\nare only two independent closed strings of this type with\na nontrivial effect on B. With these remarks, now the\ncardinalities dA and dB are\ndA = 2\u03a3A\n\n,\n\ndB = 2\u03a3B +4\u22122 .\n\n(39)\n\nWe can generalize the above results for the case that\neach subsystem is composed of several disconnected regions. Let the partitions A and B are composed of mA\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) A class of color code on the plane. It\nincludes borders each of one color. It encodes one qubits and\ncan be produced from a 2-colex without border by removing\na couple of plaquettes. To each border only strings with the\nsame color of border can have end points. (a) 3-string net\ncommutes with all plaquette operators. Such string-net and\nits deformation makes the encoded Pauli operators acting on\nthe encoded qubit. (b) A manifestation of colored string as a\nbipartition. It stands for an error.\n\nand mB disjoint regions, respectively. So, the cardinalities will be\ndA = 2\u03a3A +2mB \u22122\n\n,\n\ndB = 2\u03a3B +2mA \u22122 .\n\n(40)\n\nNow we move on in order to calculate the topological\nentanglement entropy defined in Eq.(38). For the partitions shown in Fig.(4) we have\nm1B = m4A = 2,\n\nm1A = m2A = m2B = m3A = m3B = m4B = 1,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03a31A + \u03a34A = \u03a32A + \u03a33A .\n\n(42)\n\nFinally the topological entanglement entropy reads as\nfollows:\nStopo = \u22124 .\n\n(43)\n\nTopological entanglement entropy depend only on\nthe topology of the regions and no matter with their\ngeometries12 . This derivation for topological entanglement entropy of color codes is consistent with the\nsubleading term of scaling of the entropy. The topological entanglement entropy is related to the subleading\nterm of the entanglement entropy, i.e. Stopo = \u22122\u03b3 12 .\nThis leads to \u03b3 = 2 which has also been derived Eq.(32).\n\nV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT PROPERTIES OF\nPLANAR COLOR CODES\n\nAn important class of topological stabilizer codes in\npractice is planar codes which are topological codes that\n\n\f10\ncan be embedded in a piece of planar surface. These planar codes are very interesting for topological quantum\nmemory and quantum computations9,15 . A planar color\ncode will be obtained from a 2-colex without border when\na couple of plaquettes removed from the code. For example when a plaquette, say green, is removed only green\nstrings can have endpoint on the removed plaquette not\nthe blue and red strings. The same scenario holds for\nother plaquettes. By this construction we will end with\na 2-colex that has three borders each of one color. To\neach border only strings can have endpoint which have\nsame color of that border. The most important class of\nsuch planar color code is triangular code that has been\nshown in Fig.(6). The essential property of such code\nis determined via realizing a 3-string operator and its\ndeformation. We denote them by T X and T Z so that\n{T X , T Z } = 0 since they cross each other once at strings\nwith different colors. This latter anticommutation relation can also be invoked by considering all qubits which\nmakes the triangular color code very interesting for full\nimplementation of the Clifford group without need for selective addressing15. Instead of giving such fruitful properties, we are interested in the entanglement properties\nof the triangular code.\nTo have a concrete discussion, we consider a triangular\nlattice which contains hexagons like what has been shown\nin Fig.(6). The total number of plaquettes and vertices\nare |P | = 32 k(k + 1) and |V | = 3k(k + 1) + 1, respectively,\nwhere k in an integer number. The plaquette operators\nlike those defined in Eq.(1)have been used in order to\ndefine a stabilizer subspace for this code. A main point\nabout the planar code is that there are no constraints on\nthe action of plaquette operators, i.e they are independent. For example if we product all red and green plaquette operators, the resulted operator will not be same\nwith the product of red and blue plaquette operators, a\nproperty that was absent for color code on compact surface. However, the product of distinct plaquettes is in the\nstabilizer group. The coding space is spanned with the\nstates which are fixed points of all plaquette operators.\nWith the above identifications for the number of plaquettes and vertices, the dimension of the coding space will\n|V |\nbe \u039b = 2|P2 | 2|P | = 2. This implies that triangular code\nencodes a single qubit. Two states are completely determined by the elements of stabilizer group and 3-string operator. Note that here 3-string operator plays a role like\nnontrivial closed strings in the color code on the torus.\nFor triangular code the 3-string is nontrivial, i.e. it commutes with all plaquette operators and is not product of\nsome plaquettes. So the stabilized sates will be\n|0i = |G|\u22121/2\n\nX\n\nN\n\ng|0i\n\n|V |\n\n, |1i = T X |0i .\n\n(44)\n\ng\u2208G\n\nA generic state can\nstates such as |\u03c8i =\nThe reduced density\nneed to evaluate the\n\nbe\nP1in a superposition\nP1 of the2 above\na\n|ii\nwhere\ni=0 i\ni=0 |ai | = 1.\nmatrix in Eq.(11) gives what we\nentanglement entropy. Again we\n\nmake different bipartitions and calculate the entanglement entropy.\nLet the system be in the state |0i. A single qubit is\nmaximally entangled with rest of the system while two\nqubits are not entangled implying that the triangular\ncode is also a multipartite entangled structure. As an\nanother bipartition we consider a colored spin chain\nsuch as red chain in Fig.(6b). This string contains 2k\nqubits and anticommutes with plaquettes which the\nstring has an endpoint on them, i.e they share in odd\nnumber of qubits, thus its action on the coding space\namounts to error or on the other hand to the appearance\nof excitations above the ground state if we adopt the\ncoding space as ground state of a local Hamiltonian\nas in Eq.(10). However, such a string has maximal\nentanglement SA = 2k with other qubits of the lattice.\nThis means that all configuration of the spin chain are\nallowed in the state |0i of the code, a feature that is\nsimilar to the entanglement of an open string in the\ntopological color code on the torus (see Subsec(C)).\nTaking into account the qubits living on the 3-string net\nas subsystem A leads to occurrence of configurations of\nsubsystem A with an only even number of spin flipped\nin the state |0i. For this string net as shown in Fig.(6a)\nthe number of qubits of the string is 2k + 1, and the\nentanglement entropy then will become SA = 2k. By\ninspection we see that the plaquette operators flip only\neven number of qubits of the string net. Now let the\nsystem be in a generic state such as |\u03c8i. All possible\nconfigurations of string net are allowed since all of them\ncan be realized by applying some 3-string operators T X .\nThere are 22k configurations with even number of spins\nflipped and 22k configurations with odd number of spins\nflipped. The states |0i and |1iinclude even and odd\nconfigurations, respectively. Therefore the entanglement\nentropy for a generic state will be: SA = 2k + H(\u03b1)\nwhere \u03b1 = |a0 |2 .\nWhat about the topological entanglement entropy of\nplanar color codes? In order to answer this question\nwe obtain a set of bipartitions such as in Fig.(4) in a\nlarge triangular code. Let \u03a3A and \u03a3B stand for the\nnumber of plaquette operators acting only on A and\nB, respectively, and \u03a3AB stands for the number of\nplaquette operators acting simultaneously on A and\nB. All plaquette operators are independent. To get\nthings simpler, let consider a simple case where the\nsubsystem A is a single convex connected region. The\ncardinality of the subgroup GA is 2\u03a3A . However, there\nare two non-trivial closed string acting on subsystem\nB which is impossible to provide them by product of\nsome plaquettes of B. In fact these two independent\nstrings are resulted from the product of some plaquettes,\nsay red and green, which are free to act on A. So the\ncardinality of the subgroup B reads 2\u03a3B +2 . Thus for the\nentanglement entropy we obtain SA = \u03a3AB \u2212 2.\nIn order to calculate the topological entanglement\nentropy, first the entanglement entropy is calculated for\ndifferent bipartitions and then the expression in Eq.(38)\n\n\f11\ngives the topological entropy. Because of the boundaries\nin the planar codes, for a disconnected region like (1) or\n(4) in Fig.(4) the constraint we imposed in Eq.(40) is no\nlonger true. For the bipartition (1) in Fig.(4) the cardinalities of subgroups GA and GB will be dA = 2\u03a31A +2\nand dB = 2\u03a31B +2 , respectively. However, for the bipartitions (4) in Fig.(4) the cardinalities will be dA = 2\u03a34A\nand dB = 2\u03a34B +4 , respectively. Thus the topological\nt\nentanglement entropy becomes Stopo\n= \u22124. Although\nthe closed string structures of bipartitions in the triangular code due to the boundary effects differ from\nthe color code on the torus, the topological entanglement entropy is same for both structures that is related\nto the fact that both structures have the same symmetry.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we calculated the entanglement properties of topological color codes (TCC) defined on a\ntwo-dimensional lattice.\nThe entanglement entropy\nwas measured by the von Neumann entropy.\nWe\nconsidered two structures of TCC either defined on the\ncompact or planar surface. The coding space of TCC\nis spanned by a set of states in which are the fixed\npoints of a set of commuting Pauli operators, i.e they\nare common eigenvectors of all elements of stabilizer\ngroup with eigenvalue +1. In fact this set stabilizes\nthe coding space. The stabilizer group is generated\nfrom plaquette operators. Product of different plaquette\noperators produces colored strings which in fact are the\nclosed boundary of several plaquettes. However, There\nexist some independent non-trivial strings winding the\nhandles of manifold where the model defined on. This\nnon-trivial strings commute with all plaquette operators\nbut are not actually in the stabilizer group. These\nnontrivial strings make remarkable properties of the\ncolor code more pronounced.\nFor a manifold with genus g, the coding space spanned\nby 42g states that can be adopted in which be ground\nstate of a local Hamiltonian. The degeneracy of ground\nstate subspace depends on the genus of the manifold\nwhich is a feature of topological order. Different states\nof ground state subspace can be constructed by means of\nspin flipped elements of stabilizer group and nontrivial\nclosed loops. In order to calculate the entanglement\nproperties of the TCC, the reduced density matrix of a\nsubsystem is obtained by integrating out the remanding\ndegrees of freedom. We did this by using the group\nproperties of the stabilizer group.\nFor both structures of color code on compact and planar\nsurface while a single qubit is maximally entangled with\nothers, two qubits are no longer entangled. This finding\nmanifests the color code is a genuinely multipartite\nentangled structure. We also considered other bipartitions such as spin chains, spin ladders with various\ncolors and homologies. For all bipartitions we found the\n\nentanglement entropy depends on the degrees of freedom\nliving on the boundary of two subsystems. However, in\nthe entanglement entropy of a convex region, there is\na subleading term which is ascribed to the topological\nproperties of region not the geometry, a feature that has\nalso been arisen in a massive topological theory12 . The\nfact that the entanglement entropy for a region of lattice\nscales with its boundary is a feature of area law which\nis also of great interest in other branch of physics such\nas black holes21 .\nWe exploited the scaling of the entropy to construct a\nset of bipartitions in order to calculate the topological\nentanglement entropy of color codes. We find that it\nis twice than the topological entropy in the topological\ntoric code. The non-vanishing value for topological\nentanglement entropy and dependency of degeneracy\non the genus of the surface demonstrate remarkable\nfeatures on the fact that topological color code maybe\nfabric to show topological order. For the toric code\nmodel the total quantum dimension of excitation is 4\nwhich stands for different superselection sectors of its\nanyonic excitations. The total quantum dimension of\ncolor code is 16 inspiring that the topological color\ncodes may carry richer anyonic quasiparticles. They\nmay be colored and their braiding will have nontrivial\neffect on the wavefunction of the system.\nIndeed\nbraiding of a colored quasiparticle around the another\none with different color will give rise to global phase\nfor the wavefunction, i.e they are abelian excitations.\nTriangular color code with a remarkable application for\nentanglement distillation is also a highly entangled code.\nAlthough the colored strings employed in the 2-colex in\nthe compact surface are not relevant in the triangular\ncode, the notion of string-net gives some essential\nproperties to the triangular code. In the state of the\ntriangular code all configurations of a colored string, say\na red one in Fig.(6b), are allowed, i.e is has maximal\nentanglement with the rest of the system. However, for\na string-net only the configurations with even number\nof spin flipped are allowed. Entanglement entropy scales\nwith boundary of the region and incudes a topological\nterm. This topological terms yields a non-vanishing\ntopological entanglement entropy which is same with\nwhat we obtained for the color codes on the torus.\nSimilar entanglement properties of color codes defined\non the compact and planar surface are not a matter of\nchance because both structures carry same symmetry.\n\nI would like to thank A.
