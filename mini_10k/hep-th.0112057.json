In particular they are useful to describe the behavior of strongly anisotropic\nphysical systems in condensed matter, such as organic conductors [1], charge transfer\nsalts [2] and quantum wires [3]. Probably the two most widely studied 1d systems are\nthe Hubbard model [4] and the so-called \"g-ology\" model [5]. They are known to display\nthe Luttinger liquid [6] behavior characterized by spin-charge separation and by nonuniversal (interaction dependent) power-law correlation functions. In a recent series of\npapers [7], [8] an alternative, field-theoretical approach was developed to consider this\nproblem. In these works a non-local and non-covariant version of the Thirring model\n[9] was introduced, in which the fermionic densities and currents are coupled through\nbilocal, distance-dependent potentials. This non-local Thirring model (NLT) contains\nthe Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) model [10] as a particular case. Although it constitutes\nan elegant framework to analyze the 1d many-body problem, one serious limitation appears if one tries to make contact with real systems. Indeed, one has to recall that the\nbuilding blocks of the NLT are the forward-scattering (fs) processes which are supposed\nto dominate the scene only in the low transferred momentum limit. This means that\nin its present form it can only provide a very crude description of the Luttinger liquid\nequilibrium and transport properties. In ref. [11] we started to develop an improved version of the NLT in which larger momentum transfers are taken into account by including\nback-scattering (bs) [12] and umklapp (us) [13]. This formulation led us to a highly nontrivial action whose physical content was very hard to extract. In the present paper we\nreconsider this problem from a different point of view which allowed us to get insight on\nthe spectrum of the collective modes. By using a non local version of the self-consistent\nharmonic approximation (SCHA) [14] we were able to obtain general expressions for the\nbosonic gaps as functionals of arbitrary forward, backward and umklapp scattering coupling functions. In Section 2 we present the model and review the steps that allow us to\nwrite a purely bosonic action describing the dynamics of collective excitations. In Section 3 we analyze the bosonic action by using a self-consistent harmonic approximation.\nWe derive our main formal result, i.e. the general formula for the gap, valid for pure\nbackscattering (g1 6= 0, g3 = 0) and pure umklapp scattering (g3 6= 0, g1 = 0). In Section\n4, as an example, we study in some detail the case of a non local umklapp interaction.\nIn Section 5 we present our conclusions. In the Appendix we review the main points of\nthe non local SCHA.\n\n2\n\nThe Model\n\nIn this section we begin the study of an extended version of the NLT which includes\nthe contribution of forward, backward and umklapp scattering. Following the formulation\n1\n\n\fproposed in [7] we shall attempt to describe these interactions by means of a fermionic\n(1+1)-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with Euclidean action given by\nS = S0 + Sf s + Sbs + Sus\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\n\nS0 =\n\nZ\n\nd2 x \u03a8\u0304i\u2202/\u03a8\n\n(2.2)\n\nis the unperturbed action associated to a linearized free dispersion relation. The contributions of the different scattering processes will be written as\n\nSf s\n\ng2\n=\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 x d2 y (\u03a8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03a8)(x) V(\u03bc) (x, y) (\u03a8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03a8)(y)\n\n(2.3)\n\nZ\n\n(2.4)\n\nand\n\nSbs + Sus\n\ng\u20322\n=\u2212\n2\n\nd2 x d2 y (\u03a8\u0304 \u0393\u03bc \u03a8)(x) U(\u03bc) (x, y)(\u03a8\u0304 \u0393\u03bc \u03a8)(y)\n\nwhere the \u03b3\u03bc\u2032 s are the usual two-dimensional Dirac matrices and \u03930 = 1, \u03931 = \u03b35 . Please\nkeep in mind that no sum over repeated indices is implied when a subindex (\u03bc) is involved.\nLet us also mention that the coupling potentials V(\u03bc) and U(\u03bc) are assumed to depend on\nthe distance | x \u2212 y | and can be expressed in terms of Solyom's \"g-ology\" [5] as\n1\n(g2 + g4 )(x, y)\ng2\n1\nV(1) (x, y) = 2 (g2 \u2212 g4 )(x, y)\ng\n1\nU(0) (x, y) = \u20322 (g3 + g1 )(x, y)\ng\n1\nU(1) (x, y) = \u20322 (g3 \u2212 g1 )(x, y)\ng\nV(0) (x, y) =\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n(2.8)\n\nIn the above equations g and g \u2032 are just numerical constants that could be set equal\nto one. We keep them to facilitate comparison of our results with those corresponding\nto the usual Thirring model. Indeed, this case is obtained by choosing g \u2032 = 0 and\nV(0) (x, y) = V(1) (x, y) = \u03b4 2 (x \u2212 y). On the other hand, the non-covariant limit g \u2032 = 0,\nV(1) (x, y) = 0 gives one version ((g2 = g4 ) of the TL model [10].\n2\n\n\fThe terms in the action containing g2 and g4 represent forward scattering events, in\nwhich the associated momentum transfer is small. In the g2 processes the two branches\n(left and right-moving particles) are coupled, whereas in the g4 processes all four participating electrons belong to the same branch. On the other hand, g1 and g3 are related\nto scattering diagrams with larger momentum transfers of the order of 2kF (bs) and 4kF\n(us) respectively (this last contribution is important only if the band is half-filled). For\nsimplicity, throughout this paper we will consider spinless electrons. The extension of\nour results to the spin-1/2 case with spin-flipping interactions, though not trivial, could\nbe done by following the lines of ref. [8].\nLet us now turn to the treatment of the partition function. At this point we recall\nthat in ref. [7] we wrote the fs piece of the action in a localized way :\nZ\ng2\nSf s = \u2212\nd 2 x J \u03bc K\u03bc .\n(2.9)\n2\nwhere J\u03bc is the usual fermionic current, and K\u03bc is a new current defined as\n\nK\u03bc (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 y V(\u03bc) (x, y)J\u03bc (y).\n\n(2.10)\n\nUsing a functional delta and introducing auxiliary bosonic fields in the path-integral\nrepresentation of the partition function Z, we were able to write (see [7] for details):\n\u001b\n\u001a Z\nZ\ng\n2\nZ = N D \u03a8\u0304D\u03a8D\u00c3\u03bc DB\u0303\u03bc exp \u2212 d x [\u03a8\u0304i\u2202/\u03a8 + \u00c3\u03bc B\u0303\u03bc + \u221a (\u00c3\u03bc J\u03bc + B\u0303\u03bc K\u03bc )]\n2\n(2.11)\nIf we define\nB\u0304\u03bc (x) =\n\nZ\n\nB\u0303\u03bc (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 y V(\u03bc) (y, x)B\u0303\u03bc (y),\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u22121\nd2 y V(\u03bc)\n(y, x)B\u0304\u03bc(y),\n\n(2.13)\n\n\u22121\nwith V(\u03bc)\n(y, x) satisfying\n\nZ\n\n\u22121\nd2 y V(\u03bc)\n(y, x)V(\u03bc) (z, y) = \u03b4 2 (x \u2212 z),\n\nand change auxiliary variables in the form\n3\n\n(2.14)\n\n\f1\nA\u03bc = \u221a (\u00c3\u03bc + B\u0304\u03bc ),\n2\n\n(2.15)\n\n1\nB\u03bc = \u221a (\u00c3\u03bc \u2212 B\u0304\u03bc ),\n2\n\n(2.16)\n\nwe obtain\nZ =N\n\nZ\n\n\u2212S(A,B)\u2212Sbs \u2212Sus\n\nD\u03a8\u0304D\u03a8DA\u03bc DB\u03bc e\n\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n2\n/ )\u03a8\nexp \u2212 d x \u03a8\u0304(i\u2202/ \u2212 gA\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere\n1\nS(A, B) =\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u22121\nd2 x d2 y V(\u03bc)\n(x, y)[A\u03bc (x)A\u03bc (y) \u2212 B\u03bc (x)B\u03bc (y)]\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe Jacobian associated with the change (\u00c3, B\u0303) \u2192 (A, B) is field- independent and can\nthen be absorbed in the normalization constant N . Moreover, we see that the B-field\nis completely decoupled from both the A-field and the fermion field. Keeping this in\nmind, it is instructive to try to recover the partition function corresponding to the usual\n\u22121\n\u22121\ncovariant Thirring model (V(0)\n(y, x) =V(1)\n(x, y) =\u03b4 2 (x \u2212 y), and g \u2032 = 0), starting from\n(2.17). In doing so one readily discovers that B\u03bc describes a negative-metric state whose\ncontribution must be factorized and absorbed in N in order to get a sensible answer for\nZ. This procedure parallels, in the path-integral framework, the operator approach of\nKlaiber [9], which precludes the use of an indefinite-metric Hilbert space. Consequently,\nfrom now on we shall only consider the A contribution.\nAt this stage we see that, when bs and us processes are disregarded, the procedure\nwe have just sketched allows us to express Z in terms of a fermionic determinant. Now\nwe will show that this goal can also be achieved when the larger momentum transfers are\ntaken into account. To this end we write:\n\nSbs + Sus\n\ng\u20322\n=\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 x L\u03bc M\u03bc\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere L\u03bc and M\u03bc are fermionic bilinears defined as\nL\u03bc (x) = \u03a8\u0304(x)\u0393\u03bc \u03a8(x),\n\nM\u03bc (x) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 y U(\u03bc) (x, y)L\u03bc (y).\n4\n\n(2.20)\n\n(2.21)\n\n\fThus it is evident that we can follow the same prescriptions as above, with L\u03bc and M\u03bc\nplaying the same roles as J\u03bc and K\u03bc , respectively. After the elimination of a new negative\nmetric state whose decoupled partition function is absorbed in the normalization factor,\nas before, one obtains\nZ\n/ \u2212 g \u2032 \u0393\u03bc C\u03bc ) exp (\u2212S[A] \u2212 S[C])\nZ = N DA\u03bc DC\u03bc det(i\u2202/ \u2212 gA\n(2.22)\nwhere\nZ\n1\n\u22121\nS[A\u03bc ] =\nd2 x d2 y A\u03bc (x)V(\u03bc)\nA\u03bc (y)\n2\nZ\n1\n\u22121\nd2 x d2 y C\u03bc (x)U(\u03bc)\nC\u03bc (y)\nS[C\u03bc ] =\n2\n\n(2.23)\n\nand\nZ\n\n\u22121\nd2 y U(\u03bc)\n(y, x)U(\u03bc) (z, y) = \u03b4 2 (x \u2212 z),\n\n(2.24)\n\nThen we have been able to express Z in terms of a fermionic determinant. Let us\nstress, however, that this determinant is a highly non trivial one. Indeed, the term in\ng \u2032 is not only a massive-like term (in the sense that it is diagonal in the Dirac matrices\nspace) but it also depends on the auxiliary field C\u03bc (x). As shown in [11] one can combine\na chiral change in the fermionic path-integral measure with a formal expansion in g \u2032 in\norder to get a bosonic representation for the fermionic determinant. Let us start by\nperforming the following transformation:\n\u03a8(x) =eg[\u03b35 \u03a6(x)\u2212i\u03b7(x)] \u03c7(x)\n\n(2.25)\n\n\u03a8\u0304(x) =\u03c7\u0304(x) eg[\u03b35 \u03a6(x)+i\u03b7(x)]\n\n(2.26)\n\nD \u03a8\u0304D\u03a8 = J[\u03a6, \u03b7]D \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7,\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhere \u03a6 and \u03b7 are scalar fields and J[\u03a6, \u03b7] is the Jacobian of the transformation. As\nit is well known, the above transformation permits to decouple the field A\u03bc from the\nfermionic fields if one writes\nA\u03bc (x) = \u2202\u03bc \u03b7(x) + \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6(x)\n5\n\n(2.28)\n\n\fwhich can also be considered as a bosonic change of variables with trivial (field independent) Jacobian. As a result we find\n/ \u2212 g \u2032 \u0393\u03bc C\u03bc ) = J[\u03a6, \u03b7] det(i\u2202/ \u2212 g \u2032 e2g\u03b35 \u03a6 \u0393\u03bc C\u03bc )\ndet(i\u2202/ \u2212 gA\n\n(2.29)\n\nAfter a suitable regularization the fermionic Jacobian reads [15]\ng2\nJ[\u03a6, \u03b7] = exp\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u0003\nd2 p \u0002 2\n\u2212p1 \u03a6(p)\u03a6(\u2212p) + p21 \u03b7(p)\u03b7(\u2212p) \u2212 2p0 p1 \u03a6(p)\u03b7(\u2212p) .\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(2.30)\n\nThe vacuum to vacuum functional is then expressed as\nZ =N\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nD\u03a6D\u03b7DC\u03bc e\u2212(S[\u03a6,\u03b7]+S[C\u03bc ]) J[\u03a6, \u03b7] det(i\u2202/ \u2212 g \u2032 e2g\u03b35 \u03a6 \u0393\u03bc C\u03bc )\n\n(2.31)\n\nwhere S[\u03a6, \u03b7] arises when one inserts (2.28) in S[A\u03bc ] (See equation (2.23)):\nS[\u03a6, \u03b7] =\n\nZ\n\nd2 p\n[\u03a6(p)\u03a6(\u2212p)A(p) + \u03b7(p)\u03b7(\u2212p)B(p) + \u03a6(p)\u03b7(\u2212p)C(p)]\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(2.32)\n\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng2\n1 2 \u22121\n2\n\u22121\np V\u0302 (p) + p1 (V\u0302(0) (p) + )\nA(p) =\n2 0 (1)\n\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 2 \u22121\ng2\n\u22121\n2\nB(p) =\np V\u0302 (p) + p1 (V\u0302(1) (p) \u2212 )\n2 0 (0)\n\u03c0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\ng\n\u22121\n\u22121\n.\nC(p) = p0 p1 V\u0302(0)\n(p) \u2212 V\u0302(1)\n(p) +\n\u03c0\n\n(2.33)\n(2.34)\n(2.35)\n\nThe fermionic determinant in the above expression can be analyzed in terms of a\nformal perturbative expansion. Indeed, taking g \u2032 as perturbative parameter, and using\nthe fermionic fields \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0304 defined in (2.26) one can write\n\nZF =\n\n\u221e\nX\ng \u2032n\nn=0\n\nn!\n\n* n Z\nY\n\nd2 xj \u03c7\u0304(xj ) C(xj ) \u03c7(xj )\n\nj=1\n\n+\n\n(2.36)\n\n0\n\nwhere, for later convenience we have defined\nZ F = det(i\u2202/ \u2212 g \u2032e2g\u03b35 \u03a6 \u0393\u03bc C\u03bc )\n6\n\n(2.37)\n\n\fand\nC=\n\n\u0012\n\nC+ 0\n0 C\u2212\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.38)\n\nwith\n\u001a\n\nC+ = (C0 + C1 ) e2g\u03a6(x)\nC\u2212 = (C0 \u2212 C1 ) e\u22122g\u03a6(x)\n\n(2.39)\n\nBy carefully analyzing each term in the series we found a selection rule quite\nsimilar to the one obtained in the path-integral treatment of (1+1) massive fermions\nwith local [16] [17] and non-local interactions [18]. Indeed, due to the fact that in (2.36)\nh i0 means v.e.v. with respect to free massless fermions, the v.e.v.'s corresponding to\nj = 2k + 1 are zero. Thus, we obtain\nZ Y\n\u221e\nk\nX\n(g \u2032 c\u03c1)2k\nZF =\nd2 xi d2 yi\n2 (2\u03c0)2k\n(k!)\ni=1\nk=0\n\u00d7\n\nk\nY\ni=1\n\n[C0 (xi ) + C1 (xi )] [C0 (yi ) \u2212 C1 (yi )]\n\n\u00d7 exp 2g\n\u00d7\n\nQk\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(2.40)\n\n[\u03a6(xi ) \u2212 \u03a6(yi )]\n\n4\n2\ni>j (c\u03c1) |xi \u2212 xj | |yi \u2212\nQk\n2\n2\ni,j (c\u03c1) |xi \u2212 yj |\n\nyj |2\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a normal ordering parameter and c is related to Euler's constant.\nIn order to obtain a bosonic description of the present problem we shall now propose\nthe following bosonic Lagrangian density:\n\nL\n\nB\n\n\u03b10\n1\n= (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 + 2 (m+ ei\u03b2\u03c6 + m\u2212 e\u2212i\u03b2\u03c6 )\n2\n2\u03b2\n\n(2.41)\n\nwith \u03b2, m+ (x) and m\u2212 (x) to be determined. The quantity \u03b10 is just a constant that we\ninclude to facilitate comparison of our procedure with previous works on local bosonization [16] [17]. Please notice that for m+ = m\u2212 = 1 this model coincides with the well\nknown sine-Gordon model that can be used to describe a neutral Coulomb gas. In this\ncontext \u03b1\u03b2 20 is nothing but the corresponding fugacity [19]. We shall now consider the\npartition function\n7\n\n\fZB =\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c6 e\u2212\n\nR\n\nd2 x\n\nL\n\n(2.42)\n\nB\n\nand perform a formal expansion taking the fugacity as perturbative parameter. It is quite\nstraightforward to extend the analysis of each term, already performed for m+ = m\u2212 = 1,\nto the present case in which these objects are neither equal nor necessarily constants.

(2.43)\n\nComparing this result with equation (2.40), we see that both series coincide if the\nfollowing identities hold:\n\u221a\n\u03b2 = \u00b12 \u03c0\ng \u2032\u039bc\n\u03b10\n=\n(2.44)\n\u03b22\n\u03c0\nand\nm+ (xi ) = (C0 (xi ) + C1 (xi )) e2g\u03a6(xi )\nm\u2212 (yi ) = (C0 (yi ) \u2212 C1 (yi )) e\u22122g\u03a6(yi )\n\n(2.45)\n\nThus we have found a bosonic representation for the fermionic determinant (2.40).\nThis is given by (2.42) together with the identities (2.44) and (2.45). Let us emphasize\nthat equations (2.44) are completely analogous to the bosonization formulae first obtained\nby Coleman [16] whereas equations (2.45) constitute a new result, specially connected to\nthe present problem.\n\n3\n\nDerivation of gap equations through self consistent\nharmonic approximation\n\nInserting (2.42) in (2.31) we can express the partition function of this system in terms of\nfive scalars: \u03a6, \u03b7, C0 , C1 and \u03c6.

We will consider two cases: pure backscattering (g1 6= 0, g3 = 0)\nand pure umklapp scattering (g3 6= 0, g1 = 0). Once this is done, it is straightforward\nto obtain the charge spectrum. Indeed, going to momentum space, and back to real\nfrequencies, p0 = i\u03c9, p1 = k, the following equations are obtained:\nKv\u03a9i \u2212 \u03c9 2 + v 2 k 2 = 0.\n\n(3.18)\n\nThe gap equations satisfied by \u03a9i are:\n4\u039b2 c2\n\u03a91,3 (p) =\n\u03c0\nwhere\n\nZ\n\nI1 (x) =\n\nd2 x g1,3 (x)e\u22124\u03c0[I1 (x)\u2213I1 (0)] (eipx \u2213 1)\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212ipx\nd2 p\n(2\u03c0)2 F (p) + \u03a9i (p)\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nEquation (3.19) is our main formal result. It gives, within the SCHA, a closed expression for the gap as functional of any arbitrary strength of the interactions (the gi\u2032 s). Let\nus study, as examples, the cases where umklapp and backscattering are local interactions\n(i.e. g13 (x) = g13 \u03b4 2 (x)), but keeping arbitrary fs interactions. It is easy to see that the\npure backscattering process is gapless (\u03a91 = 0) and that the umklapp interaction opens\na gap in the charge density spectrum (\u03a93 = constant), as expected [12] [13]. For this last\ncase we obtain\n8\u039b2 c2 \u22128\u03c0I1 (0)\ng3 e\n(3.21)\n\u03c0\nAs \u03a93 is a constant, i.e. it does not depend on p we can calculate the propagator in terms\nof \u03a93 , and the equation then reduces to an algebraic equation for \u03a93 . If we consider\nalso contact fs potentials (i.e. g2,4 (x) = g2,4 \u03b4 2 (x)), the integral I1 (0) can be explicitly\nperformed. After a suitable regularization one obtains:\n\u03a93 =\n\n4\u039b2\n\u03a93 =\nK\n\n\u0012\n\n2c2 K\ng3\n\u03c0\n\n1\n\u0013 1\u22122K\n\n.\n\n(3.22)\n\nAn equation completely analogous to (3.21) was found in [8] by working directly with\na local coupling associated to spin-flipping interactions in that case. This provides a\nconsistency check for our computation. Of course, having derived a general formula for\nthe gap, like (3.19), it is interesting to analyze the effect of a non-contact interaction on\nthe gap. We present this study in the next section.\n11\n\n\f4\n\nGap of charge-density modes for a non-local umklapp coupling\n\nThe purpose of this Section is to find a solution to equation (3.19) for a pure umklapp\npotential of the form\ng3 (p) = \u03bb0 +\n\n\u01eb 2\np .\n\u039b2 1\n\n(4.1)\n\nbeing \u01eb \u226a 1.

Performing the derivation and rearranging\nterms we can write\ni\n4\u039b2 c2 h\n\u01eb 2\n4c2 \u01eb \u22128\u03c0I1 (0) 2\n\u03a9(p) =\n2\u03bb0 + 8\u03c0 2 \u22021 I1 (0) e\u22128\u03c0I1 (0) +\ne\np1\n\u03c0\n\u039b\n\u03c0\n\n(4.4)\n\n\u03a9(p) = \u03bc2 + gp21\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn this last equation we have disregarded terms proportional to \u22021 I1 (0) which is zero by\nsymmetry. We observe that \u03a9 retains the same structure as g3 (p) i.e. it is of the form\n\nwhere \u03bc2 and g are two parameters to be determined in terms of \u03bb0 and \u01eb. The fact that\n\u03a9 preserves its simple form allows to calculate the propagator, as occurs in the local case,\nand in consequence, to transform the equation into an algebraic one, easier to deal with.\nThe objects needed are the propagator in the origin I1 (0) and its second derivative in the\norigin \u220212 I1 (0). Theirs expression are\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bc2 Kv\n\u2212Kv\n,\nln\nI1 (0) = p\n4\u039b2 (v 2 + Kgv)\n4\u03c0 v 2 + Kgv\n12\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fand\n\n\u220212 I1 (0)\n\n\u2212\u039b2 Kv\n= p\n8\u03c0 v 2 + Kgv\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u0014\ne\u03bc2 Kv\n\u03bc2 Kv\n\u22122 .\nln\n\u039b2 (v 2 + Kgv)\n4\u039b2 (v 2 + Kgv)\n\n(4.7)\n\nReplacing (4.5), (4.6) and (4.7) in equation (4.4), and equating the coefficients of each\npower of p, we obtain the pair of equations\n\nx=\n\n\"\n\ngKv\n\n\u01ebKv\n\np\n\u03bb0 \u2212 p\n(2x ln ex + 1)\n2\u01eb v 2 + Kgv\nv 2 + Kgv\ng=\n\n4\u01ebc2 2Kv/\u221av2 +Kgv\nx\n\u03c0\n\n#\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere we have introduced the adimensional quantity x = \u03bc2 Kv/4\u039b2(v 2 + Kgv). These\ncoupled equations are to be solved for g and x.\nOf course, a complete solution of (4.8) and (4.9) is very difficult to obtain, but we can\nobtain an approximate solution in the limit \u01eb \u226a 1. It corresponds to take a small non\nlocal correction to the local potential. For \u01eb = 0 the solution is g = 0, and we expect no\ndiscontinuities as \u01eb grows from that value. So for small \u01eb the solution for g is also small.\nThis allows to approximate v 2 + Kgv \u2248 v 2 , and one then gets\nx=\n\n2c2 K 2K\nx [\u03bb0 \u2212 \u01ebK(2x ln ex + 1)]\n\u03c0\n\n(4.10)\n\n4c2 \u01eb 2K\nx\n\u03c0\n\n(4.11)\n\ng=\n\nWe notice that the first equation does not depend on g, though it is still difficult to\nsolve. We shall employ a perturbative approach. Suppose x0 is the solution to the \u01eb = 0\nequation:\n\nx0 =\n\n\u0012\n\n2c2 K\u03bb0\n\u03c0\n\n1\n\u0013 1\u22122K\n\n(4.12)\n\nWe can try a solution of the form x = x0 + \u03b4x where \u03b4x goes to zero as \u01eb approaches\nzero. Replacing this form into the equation, and retaining terms up to first order in \u03b4x\nwe obtain\n13\n\n\f\u03b4x =\n\n\u22122\u01ebx0 (2x0 ln ex0 + 1)\n\u03bb0 (1 \u2212 2K)\n\n(4.13)\n\n2\u01ebx0\nK\u03bb0\n\n(4.14)\n\ng=\n\nThe first equation gives the correction to the gap of charge-density modes due to\nnon-contact umklapp interactions. If one introduces a small non local perturbation, it\nis enough to modify the value of the gap. Note that the numerator can be positive or\nnegative, depending on the value of x0 , so the same happens with the modification in\nthe gap. It can be lowered or increased by umklapp non local interactions. The second\nequation gives the correction to the kinetic part of the spectrum.\n\n5\n\nFinal result and next steps\n\nIn this paper we have presented a non local and non covariant extension of the Thirring\nmodel which can be used to describe a 1d many-body system when not only forward but\nalso backward and umklapp scattering is considered. In this sense our results improve\nprevious formulations reported in [7] and [11]. We were able to write the vacuum to\nvacuum functional of this model in terms of a non-trivial fermionic determinant. We\nobtained a bosonic representation for this determinant which led us to an effective action\nassociated to the elementary collective excitations of the system. By employing the selfconsistent harmonic approximation we found a closed expression for the gap of the chargedensity spectrum as functional of arbitrary (not necessarily local) two-body potentials.\nThis equation is valid for purely backward (g1 6= 0, g3 = 0) or pure umklapp scattering\n(g3 6= 0, g1 = 0). As an application of this formula we studied the effect of a non local\numklapp potential of the form g3 (p) = \u03bb0 + (\u01eb/\u039b2 )p21 for \u01eb small. Besides its illustrative\npurpose, the result obtained in this example is interesting in itself because most of the\nprevious investigations involving umklapp scattering do not consider non local effects\n[21].\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partially supported by Universidad Nacional de La Plata and Consejo\nNacional de Investigaciones Cient\u0131\u0301ficas y T\u00e9cnicas, CONICET (Argentina).\n\n14\n\n\f6\n\nAppendix: details of the SCHA method\n\nWe shall give an sketch of the SCHA method. One usually starts from a partition function\nZ true =\n\nZ\n\nD\u03bce\u2212Strue\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere D\u03bc is a generic integration measure. An elementary manipulation leads to\nZ true =\n\nR\n\nD\u03bce\u2212(Strue \u2212Strial ) e\u2212Strial\nR\nD\u03bce\u2212Strial\n\nZ\n\nD\u03bce\u2212Strial = Z trial e\u2212(Strue \u2212Strial )\n\ntrial\n\n.\n\n(6.2)\n\nfor any trial action Strial . Now, by means of the property\ne\u2212f \u2265 e\u2212hf i ,\n\n(6.3)\n\nfor f real, and taking natural logarithm in equation (6.2), we obtain Feynman's inequality\n[20]\nln Z true \u2265 ln Z trial \u2212 hStrue \u2212 Strial itrial\n\n(6.4)\n\nWe shall study a very general class of true bosonic actions of non local sine Gordon\ntype, given by\n\nStrue =\n\nZ\n\nd2 p\nF (p)\n\u03c6(p)\n\u03c6(p) \u2212\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 x d2 y\n\n\u03b1(x \u2212 y)\n\u03c6(x) + \u03c6(y)\ncos b\n,\n2\nb\n2\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere F (p) and \u03b1(x, y) are arbitrary functions. The usual local sine Gordon theory is\nobtained by taking F (p) = p2 and \u03b1(x, y) = \u03b10 \u03b4 (2) (x \u2212 y) whereas (6.5) reduces to our\nmodel (3.13) without backscattering interactions (i.e. g1 = 0) by taking\nF (p) =\n\n1 2\n(p + v 2 p21 )\nKv 0\n\n(6.6)\n\nb2 = 16\u03c0\n\n(6.7)\n\n\u03b1(x, y)\n(\u039bc)2\n=\ng3 (x, y)\nb2\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(6.8)\n\n15\n\n\fThe trial action we will consider is a quadratic one:\n\nStrial =\n\nZ\n\nd2 p\nF (p)\n\u03c6(p)\n\u03c6(p) \u2212\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 x d2 y\n\n\u03a9(x \u2212 y)\n\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)\n2\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere the function \u03a9 can be determined by maximizing the right hand side of equation\n(6.4). In order to achieve this goal we first write\n\nln Z trial = ln\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nD\u03c6 exp \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd x \u03c6(x)(\u00c2\u03c6)(x)\n\n= ln(det \u00c2)\u22121/2 + const\n1\n= \u2212 tr ln \u00c2 + const.\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(6.10)\n(6.11)\n(6.12)\n\nwhere the operator \u00c2 is defined, in Fourier space, by\n(\u00c2\u03c6)(p) = [F (p) + \u03a9(p)]\u03c6(p).\n\n(6.13)\n\nbeing \u03a9(p) is the Fourier transform of \u03a9(z). It is then easy to get\nd2 p\nln[F (p) + \u03a9(p)] \u2261 VI0 [\u03a9]\n(6.14)\n(2\u03c0)2\nR\nwhere V is the volume (infinite) of the whole space d2 x . On the other hand, it is\nstraightforward to compute hStrue \u2212 Strial i, by following, for instance, the steps explained\nin ref. [18]. The result is\ntr ln \u00c2 = V\n\n\u2212 hStrue \u2212 Strial itrial = V\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b1(x) \u2212 1 b2 [I1 (x)+I1 (0)] \u03a9(x)\ndx\n+\ne 4\nI1 (x)\nb2\n2\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere I1 (x) is a functional of \u03a9 given by the propagator of the trial action:\n\nI1 (x) =\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212ipx\nd2 p\n.\n(2\u03c0)2 F (p) + \u03a9(p)\n\n(6.16)\n\nand we have made use of the traslational invariance of \u03b1 and \u03a9. Finally we can gather\nall the terms, and write them as\n\n16\n\n\fln Z trial \u2212 hStrue \u2212 Strial itrial\n\nV\n=\n2\n\n\u03b1(x) 1 2\nd2 x 2 e\u2212 4 b [I1 (x)+I1 (0)]\nb\nZ\nV\nd2 p\nV\n\u03a9(\u2212p)\n+\n\u2212 I0 [\u03a9] + const. (6.17)\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) F (p) + \u03a9(p)\n2\n\nZ\n\nwhere we have turned the last term of equation (6.15) into Fourier space. Now extremizing\nexpression (6.17) with respect to \u03a9 by functional derivation with respect to \u03a9(k), we\nfinally obtain the gap equation\n1\n\u03a9(p) =\n2\n\nZ\n\n1 2\n[I\n\nd2 x \u03b1(x)e\u2212 4 b\n\n1 (x)+I1 (0)]\n\n(e\u2212ipx + 1)\n\n(6.18)\n\nIf instead of considering only umklapp interactions we consider only backscattering\ninteractions (g3 = 0) then we have to change \u03c6(x) + \u03c6(y) \u2192 \u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(y) into the cosine\nof equation (6.5), and the resulting gap equation is\n1\n\u03a9(p) =\n2\n\nZ\n\n1 2\n[I\n\nd2 x \u03b1(x)e\u2212 4 b\n\n1 (x)\u2212I1 (0)]\n\n(e\u2212ipx \u2212 1)\n\n(6.19)\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
