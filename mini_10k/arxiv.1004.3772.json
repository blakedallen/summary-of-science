These are the string theory [1]\nand higher dimensional brane-world scenarios [2]. The\nlow energy limit of the string theory can be described\nby the slope expansion in powers of the inverse string\ntension (or of the inverse square of the fundamental string\nscale l\u22122\ns ) that produces higher curvature corrections to\nthe Einstein action. The quadratic term in curvature\n(given by the so-called Gauss-Bonnet invariant) is the\nleading correction that can affect the graviton excitation\nspectrum near the flat space.\nThe extra dimensional scenarios also suggest that the\nfundamental gravity scale M\u2217 might be around the weak\nscale \u223c T eV . Thus, at particle collisions with the cross\nsection \u223c \u03c0rs2 , where rs is the Schwarzschild radius, and\nenergies larger than M\u2217 , the production of mini-black\nholes should start. These black holes are intrinsically\nhigher dimensional and usually modeled by the Tangherlini metric, which is the solution of the D-dimensional\nEinstein equations. However, in order to have a mathematically noncontradictory gravity in higher dimensions,\none has to take account of higher curvature corrections of\nthe same form as those appearing in the slope expansion\nof the string theory. The spherically symmetric solution\ndescribing neutral static black holes in the D-dimensional\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: konoplya_roma@yahoo.com\naddress: zhidenko@fma.if.usp.br\n\nEinstein gravity with the GB corrections was obtained\nin [3]. This solution contains small corrections to the\nD-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini geometry and\nconsequently properties of such Gauss-Bonnet corrected\nblack holes were expected to differ only slightly from the\nSchwarzschild's ones. This happens, for instance, for the\nspectrum of proper oscillations of these black holes [4].\nUnlike astrophysical black holes, whose Hawking evaporation is negligibly small, mini-black holes are intensively evaporating what leads to the very short lifetime\nof these black holes, once they are created. The latter is due-to strong production of various particles from\nthe vacuum around a black hole and emission of them\nthrough the mechanism of Hawking radiation [5]. At\nlarge number of space-time dimensions D, the specific\n\"tensorial\" type of gravitons (respectively the D \u2212 2 rotation group) dominates in the emission process [13].\nUp to now, an impressively extensive literature is devoted to the calculations of Hawking evaporation of the\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry black holes\n[6\u201310], while evaporation of their higher curvature corrected generalizations was touched upon only in a couple\nof works [11, 12]. In particular, T. Rizzo estimated the\nenergy-emission rate for the higher curvature corrected\nblack holes, assuming that the grey-body factor equals\nunity [11]. This was expected to give the correct answer\nabout the order of the intensity of the Hawking emission.\nThough, as we shall show in this paper, the contribution\ndue to the grey-body factors can also considerably change\nthe results. In [12], the scattering of Standard Model particles around Gauss-Bonnet black holes was considered,\nthough the calculations were terminated at the grey-body\nfactors and the numbers of particles per frequency. Thus,\n\n\f2\nnone of the above works calculated the energy-emission\nrate for Gauss-Bonnet black holes that is necessary for\nthe estimation of the total emission of energy and thus of\nthe black hole lifetime. Here we shall fill this gap and calculate the energy-emission rates for fields of various spin,\nincluding gravitons, and thus shall estimate the lifetime\nof Gauss-Bonnet black holes.\nIn this work, we shall show that due to a number of\nreasons, the emission of the tensor type of gravitons is\ngreatly (in fact exponentially) suppressed when one turns\non the GB coupling \u03b1\u2032 . Thus, even at small values of the\nGB coupling constant \u03b1\u2032 the graviton emission is suppressed by many orders. This means that small GB corrections lead to a much longer life of higher dimensional\nblack holes than was expected [13\u201315]. At first sight this\nenormous suppression would not seem trustworthy: why\ndo slight corrections of geometry produce a very strong\neffect on the evaporation process? The reasons for this\nare \"multiplication\" of the two factors. First, the black\nhole gets much colder when one turns on the GB coupling\nand the emission rate is quadratic in temperature. Sec-\n\nII.\n\nond, the emission is proportional to the grey-body factor\nwhich is exponentially suppressed for tensorial gravitons.\nThis explanation certainly did not make us trust the result immediately. Therefore we reproduced our accurate\nnumerical calculations by the semianalytical WKB estimations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Sec II briefly discuss the deduction of wave equations for perturbations\nof fields of various spin. Sec III is devoted to numerical\ncalculation of the coefficients of transmission, while Sec.\nIII B gives WKB values of the coefficients. In Sec. IV the\nobtained scattering data are used for the calculations of\nthe energy-emission rates. Using the WKB arguments\nSec. V explains why the found enormous suppression of\nHawking evaporation occurs. In Sec. VI we estimate\nthe lifetime of Gauss-Bonnet corrected black holes and\noutline the future perspective for this direction.\nWe shall consider the canonical ensemble, which leads\nto the same results as the microcanonical one if the black\nhole mass M is at least a few times larger than M\u2217 [11].\n\nTHE WAVE LIKE EQUATIONS\nA.\n\nGravitational perturbations\n\nThe Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet action is\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nD \u221a\n\u2032\nd x \u2212gR + \u03b1\nI=\ndD x \u2212g(Rabcd Rabcd \u2212 4Rcd Rcd + R2 ),\n16\u03c0GD\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u2032 is the coupling constant; \u03b1\u2032 = 1/2\u03c0l2s .

Examples of contributions of various multipoles and of various types of gravitons (scalar, vector\nand tensor) are given in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. These\nare given for D = 6 as an example, while from the table\nI, we can see the relative contributions for all types of\nparticles for various numbers of space-time dimensions.\nIn Fig. 10 one can see contributions of brane-localized\nStandard model fields into the energy-emission rate: for\nD \u2265 6 the larger spin of a field, the larger is the corresponding energy-emission rate per unit frequency around\nits maximum.\nAn important observation for our future discussion is\nabout the role of the tensor type of gravitons in the\nevaporation process. For vanishing GB coupling the tensor type of gravitons corresponds to the highest energyemission rate, which leads to the dominance of tensorial\ngravitons among all particles in the Hawking radiation at\nlarge D (see Figs. 8, 9). For non zero \u03b1 this is not true\nanymore: the energy-emission rates of tensorial gravitons\nbecome strongly suppressed and the Standard Model particles dominate in the evaporation at high D.\nFinally, let us justify here in more detail why we chose\nthe units of the fixed event horizon and not the units of\nthe fixed black hole mass.\nFirst, we would like to mention that from the values\nin units of the black hole radius, using a simple formula\nwhich we shall show in the next section, we are always\nable to recalculate values of the energy-emission rate in\nunits of the black hole mass or Planck mass. The inverse\nformula is not so simple because the mass appears in\nthe left-hand side as well. Second, in order to calculate\nthe energy-emission rate in units of the mass, we must\nfix in some way the real Planck mass, which we do not\n\n1  \u0301 1027\n5  \u0301 1026\n\n1  \u0301 1026\n5  \u0301 1025\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nM HTeVL\n\nFIG. 11: The energy-emission rate as a function of mass M\nfor D = 10 Schwarzschild (top line) and \u03b1 = 0.1T eV \u22122 GB\n(bottom line) black holes, M\u2217 = 1T eV . According to the\nrecent experiments M\u2217 \u2265 0.6T eV (for D = 10) [14]. For\nlarger M\u2217 the plots are qualitatively the same.\n\nyet know. Third, the purpose of the table I is to show\nthat, independently on the new Planck mass, the energyemission rate decreases some orders. This is a general\nresult, which we would lose if we fix the Planck mass in\nsome way. In order to show this effect we present a figure\nin the units of TeVs to illustrate how the emission rate\ndepends on the back hole mass (Fig. 11).\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nFrom Fig. 12 and Table I one can see that the energyemission rate decreases quickly (in fact, almost exponentially) with \u03b1 . In order to understand why this happens\nfor relatively small corrections to the black hole geometry let us use the WKB approach and consider the cases\nof small and large \u03c9 of separately.\nThe numerical data, which we obtained here (Table I),\ndo not use the small \u03c9 expansion of [13] and are, thereby,\n\n\f11\ndE\n\n\u00c8A2\n\n2\n\ndt\n0.024\n\n0.001\n-4\n\n5  \u0301 10\n\n0.022\n\n1  \u0301 10-4\n5  \u0301 10-5\n0.020\n\n1  \u0301 10-5\n5  \u0301 10-6\n\n0.018\n\u0391\n0.05\n\n\u0391\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n4\n\n2.0\n3\n1.5\n2\n1.0\n1\n\n0.5\n\nV (r) =\n\nr\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n+\u03b1\u00d7\n\n+O(\u03b12 ).\n\nr\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.20\n\nFIG. 12: Energy-emission rate of the tensor-type gravitons as\na function of \u03b1 for D = 6.\n2.5\n\n0.10\n\n3.0\n\nFIG. 13: Expansion of the tensor-type perturbation potential\nD = 5, l = 2.\n\nmore accurate.\nWhen \u03c9 2 < Vmax , the energy-emission rate decreases\ndue to the suppression of the grey-body factor for tensor gravitons. In order to show this we use the WKB\napproximation. For \u03c9 2 \u226a Vmax the WKB formula reads\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\np\n|A|2 \u2248 exp \u22122 dr\u2217 V (r\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03c9 2 ,\n(24)\n\nwhere integration is performed between the two turning\npoints V (r\u2217 ) = \u03c9 2 . On Fig. 13 we see that the leading\norder of \u03b1 increases the height of the potential barrier, as\nwell as the distance between the turning points. Then,\n\nFIG. 15: Grey-body factor of the tensor-type gravitational\nperturbations as a function of \u03b1 (D = 6, l = 2, \u03c9r0 = 1.5).\n\nfrom (24) it is clear that that the grey-body factor decreases exponentially as the effective potential for tensor\ngravitons grows.\nIn the eikonal approximation for \u03c9 2 . Vmax one has\n\u221a\n\u2032\u2032\n\u22122\u03c0(Vmax \u2212\u03c9 2 )/ \u22122Vmax\ne\n2\n\u221a\n|A| \u2248\n.\n\u2032\u2032\n2\n1 + e\u22122\u03c0(Vmax \u2212\u03c9 )/ \u22122Vmax\nAs the height of the potential increases with growing\n\u03b1, the dominant contribution comes from the numerator and the grey-body factor for tensor gravitons is\n|A|2 \u221d e\u2212C(\u03c9)\u03b1 ,\n\nC(\u03c9) > 0.\n\nFor large values of \u03c9 it is evident that |A|2 \u2248 1. Thus,\nthe dominant contribution to the energy-emission rate at\nlarge \u03c9 comes from the temperature, which decreases as\n(see Fig. 14)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 4)\u03b1\nTH = TH (0) 1 \u2212\n.\n2r02\nTherefore the energy-emission rate decreases exponentially with \u03b1\n\nTH\n\nX\n2\n\u03c9\n\u22022E\n\u22022E\n\u00d7e\u2212\u03c9(D\u22121)(D\u22124)\u03b1/(2r0 TH ) .\n\u2248\nNl e\u2212\u03c9/TH\n\u2202t\u2202\u03c9\n2\u03c0\n\u2202t\u2202\u03c9\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1=0\n\nLet us compare the Hawking radiation of Schwarzschild\nand GB black holes produced due to particle collisions of\nthe same energy.

In order to convert the energy-emission rate in\nthe units of T eV /s, we divide it by the Plank constant\n~ = 6.58 * 10\u221228 T eV * s. For \u03b1 = 0.1M\u2217\u22122 and D = 10,\nthe total energy-emission rate of GB black holes can be\nas much as 103 times smaller (see Fig. 11) than that of\nthe Schwarzschild one. For other values of D the increase\nin the lifetime of black holes can be easily calculated in\nthe same way.\nThus, we have shown that even small GB corrections\nto the D-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry lead to the\ngreat increasing of the lifetime of black holes, up to quite\na few orders. This is certainly not enough for accreting of\nmatter and thus is not dangerous for experiments at the\nLHC, yet, it will produce a potentially observable effect.\nA natural question is, what is the fraction of the contribution of the grey-body factor into suppression of emission of the tensorial gravitons, and consequently into\noverall lifetime of black holes. An exact answer is, however, not as easy as it drastically depends on a number\nof conditions: the mass of the black hole M , the value\nof the GB coupling \u03b1, the number of space-time dimensions D and is strongly connected with the dominance of\na particular type of particles for fixed \u03b1, M , D.\nA brief hint could be given by the plot of the greybody factor as a function of \u03b1, which is shown in Fig.\n15. For example, the grey-body factor for D = 6 can be\nsuppressed at the rate of about 35% for sufficiently small\n\u03b1/r02 \u2248 0.1, which is one tenth of its threshold values\nof instability [20]. Going beyond very small values of \u03b1\nwould require inclusion of corrections of higher orders of\ncurvature in the action. Thus, the first factor of the two\nwhich was mentioned in the abstract of this article, i.e.\nthe quick cooling of a black hole when \u03b1 grows, is definitely a dominant factor of suppression of the Hawking\nradiation.\n\nLet us note that the suppression of the energy-emission\nrate at high \u03c9 due to the cooling of a black hole was observed in [11] for the Standard Model particles. Though\nthe largest suppression of the graviton emission reported\nin [11] is at M . M\u2217 . In this regime however one cannot\ntrust the solution (2), which is gravitationally unstable\n[20]. The other factor, the decreasing of the grey-body\nfactors of the tensorial gravitons, seemingly increased the\nsuppression of the graviton emission at small \u03b1.\n\n[1] P. Horava and E.

Intensive Hawking emission of gravitons, as well as of other\nparticles, is suppressed by many orders, when one takes\ninto consideration small quantum Gauss-Bonnet corrections. Consequently, the lifetime of quantum corrected\nblack holes is many orders larger than it is expected according to the current literature [25]. This makes further\ninvestigations of Hawking radiation of higher curvature\ncorrected black holes appealing.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nR.
