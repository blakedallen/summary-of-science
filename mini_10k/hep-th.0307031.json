Introduction\nRecent observations of supernovae indicate that the universe is accelerating [1, 2, 3].\nThis suggests that, at present, the energy density of the universe is dominated by a\nfluid with an equation of state p < \u2212 13 \u03c1. We will assume in this paper that the source\nof the observed acceleration is a positive cosmological constant\np = \u2212\u03c1 = \u2212\u03bb .\n\n(1.1)\n\nWe will then argue that in this case, the entropy stored in local field theoretical degrees\nof freedom cannot exceed a bound set by a power of the cosmological constant. The\nupper bound on this entropy scales like \u03bb\u22123/4 , which is parametrically smaller than the\nentropy of empty de Sitter space, SDS \u223c \u03bb\u22121 [4]. We will refer in the rest of the paper\nto the entropy of the microwave background, although the discussion applies to the\nentropy of any field theoretical degree of freedom.\nThe physics that underlies the bound, in a nutshell, is the limited efficiency with\nwhich a fluid described by local field theoretical degrees of freedom stores entropy in\nspace. This capacity to store information, as seen by local observers, depends on the\n\n1\n\n\fequation of state. It was shown [6] that the entropy of a fluid with an equation of state\np = \u03ba\u03c1 scales as a power of the linear size R,\nS\u223cR\n\n2\n3\u2212 1+\u03ba\n\n.\n\n(1.2)\n\nThis result was obtained in the absence of a cosmological constant. We will show\nthat any attempt, when there is no cosmological constant, to squeeze more entropy in\na region of fixed size R leads to the formation of black holes. This implies that for\nradiation, \u03ba = 1/3, a given region of space with linear size R can only accommodate an\nentropy of O(R3/2 ). This is rather inefficient when compared to the storage capabilities\nof a black hole, or a fluid with \u03ba = 1. Indeed, in the latter cases the entropy scales like\nthe area, R2 .\nOne might then wonder about what happens to the \"storage of entropy\" in the\npresence of a positive cosmological constant. We will argue that in order for such\na space-time to asymptote to de Sitter space, there is a bound on the amount of\nstored entropy, that a local observer can ever measure. This local observer eventually\nperceives this space-time as a hot cavity [7] of finite size \u03bb\u22121/2 in which the entropy of\nthe microwave background never exceeds \u03bb\u22123/4 . The bulk of the paper is devoted to\nargue that any attempt to store more entropy than the bound allows, meets with black\nhole formation or a change of the equation of state to a stiffer one, or more probably\nimprints itself on the event horizon of de Sitter space, and in some cases the universe\nends up in a big crunch.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section 2, as a warm-up, we discuss what\nhappens in the contracting phase of a space-time with a cosmological constant and a\nperfect fluid, as a function of the entropy of the fluid. In section 3, we discuss how\nefficient a fluid in equilibrium can be in packing entropy. We then use in section 4 the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Snyder (TOS) model [8] in a way that differs from its original\npurpose. In this paper, we use the TOS model in the presence of a cosmological constant\n[9] to give us a handle on the amount of entropy inside a \"star\". This will allow us to\ndraw further evidence for our bound. We end with conclusions and an appendix where\na preliminary setup in the \"O-gauge\" [16] can be found.\n\n2. Contracting Phase of a Space-time with a Fluid and a Cosmological Constant\nIn this section we will consider the case of a homogeneous universe with a positive\ncosmological constant and a perfect fluid. We will show that any attempt to store\nmore information, during the contracting phase of this cosmology, than what is allowed\n\n2\n\n\fby a bound on the entropy, leads to a big crunch 1 . Consider he Friedmann-RobertsonWalker (FRW) metric,\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a(t)2\n\n\u0010\n\nd\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03a922\n\nThe equation that the scale factor obeys is,\n\u0012 \u00132\n\n\u0227\na\n\n+\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n1\n\u03bb\n=\n+ \u03c1(a) ,\na2\n3\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03c1(a) is the energy density of the fluid 2 . We will use a fluid with a linear equation\nof state, p = \u03ba\u03c1. For a given \u03ba the energy density obeys\n\u03c1(a0 ) a0 3(1+\u03ba)\n\u03c1(a) =\n.\n(2.3)\na3(1+\u03ba)\nBy using the thermodynamic relation between the energy and entropy densities,\n\u03c1 \u223c \u03c3 1+\u03ba ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nit is then convenient for our purposes to rewrite the energy density as,\nS0 1+\u03ba\n,\n(2.5)\na3(1+\u03ba)\nwhere S0 is the entropy associated with the fluid when the scale factor is a0 . Using this\nlast equation, we can then rewrite (2.2) as\n\u03c1(a) =\n\n1\n\u03bb\nS0 1+\u03ba\n\u0227\n+ 2 = + 3(1+\u03ba) .\n(2.6)\na\na\n3 a\nThis equation implies that in order to avoid a big crunch, a \u2192 0, S0 should be bounded\nfrom above by\n\u2212 1+3\u03ba\nS0 < C\u03ba \u03bb 2(1+\u03ba) ,\n(2.7)\n\u0012 \u00132\n\nwhere C\u03ba is a positive number that depends on \u03ba and microscopic physics of the fluid.3\nFor radiation the bound reads\nS0 < C1/3 \u03bb\u22123/4 ,\n(2.8)\nwhere C1/3 is a coefficient of O(1).\nThe bound for the entropy given by (2.7), has an intriguing interpretation. The\npower law is exactly the one that is obtained if one answers the question about the\nmaximum amount of entropy in the fluid, at the threshold of black hole formation, that\ncan fit in a box of linear size, \u03bb\u22121/2 , i.e. the size of the de Sitter horizon.\n1\n\nFor a discussion on the endpoint of a big crunch, see [10].\nFor the remainder of the paper we will work in Planck units.\n3\nA similar bound on the entropy as a function of the cosmological constant for closed universes was\nfound years ago by Gibbons [11] in a completely different context.\n2\n\n3\n\n\f3. Efficiency of Entropy Packing\nIn this section we will give a heuristic derivation of the scaling law of the entropy of\na fluid as a function of the size of the region to which it is confined. We will assume\nthat a perfect fluid contained in a box of size R has a linear equation of state p = \u03ba\u03c1.\nWe will estimate the entropy versus box size as one tries to pack entropy to the verge\nof black hole formation. We will assume that a single mode but no more than a single\nmode of the fluid, with energy \u01eb occupies a volume \u01eb3 in Planck units. The number\ndensity of modes is\nn(\u01eb) = \u01eb\u22123 .\n(3.1)\nThe energy density as a function of \u01eb is,\n\u03c1(\u01eb) = \u01eb\u22122 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nUsing the thermodynamics relation between the entropy density \u03c3 and the energy\ndensity \u03c1,\n1\n(3.3)\n\u03c3(\u01eb) \u223c \u03c1(\u01eb) 1+\u03ba ,\nwe obtain a relation, at the threshold of black hole formation [12], between the entropy\nS and the size R of the region where the fluid is contained.\nS(R) \u223c\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nR\n\nd\u01eb \u01eb2 \u03c3(\u01eb) \u223c R\n\n2\n3\u2212 1+\u03ba\n\n.\n\n(3.4)\n\nNotice that this is the exact same scaling law for the entropy that was derived\nfrom the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations [6] describing a spherically\nsymmetric perfect fluid in equilibrium 4 .\nIt seems reasonable to conclude, based on the earlier heuristic derivation of the\nscaling law, that any attempt to squeeze more entropy in a given volume beyond the\nbound (2.7) leads to black hole formation. This picture seems consistent with our\npresent understanding that a black hole is the most efficient environment at packing\nentropy.\nThe previous discussion on efficient entropy packing, is modified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. Additional distinction should be made between the contracting and expanding parts of the FRW geometry. In the contracting phase black\nhole formation is enhanced, and the bound on the entropy remains the same. In the\nexpanding case, when the size of the region containing the fluid becomes of O(\u03bb\u22121/2 )\n4\n\nThe derivation of the entropy at the threshold of black hole formation can be easily generalized\n1\nto an arbitrary number of dimensions and 1\u2212D\n< \u03ba \u2264 1. The result reproduces the scaling obtained\nusing the TOV equations in D dimensions\n\n4\n\n\fthe fluid is subjected to a pull due to the cosmological constant, which makes it increasingly harder to increase the entropy in that region beyond the bound discussed\nin the absence of \u03bb. However any attempt to violate the bound is accompanied by a\nrepackaging of the excess entropy until one reaches the \"Bekenstein bound\".\nIn order to provide additional intuition about the bound for the entropy of a fluid in\nthe presence of a cosmological constant, we will devote our next discussion to studying\na modified version of the TOS model [8]. The TOS model was originally designed\nto describe the collapse of a spherical star made of dust. The interior of the star is\nmodeled by a FRW geometry, whereas the exterior (using Birkhoff's theorem) is a static\nSchwarzchild geometry.\n\n4. A generalized TOS model\nThe TOS model will be modified in what follows, by adding a cosmological constant\n[9]. Our intention is to view the star from the outside as the amount of entropy on\nthe inside is tuned to eventually violate the aforementioned bound. In the setup of\nthis generalized TOS model, we will closely follow some of the analysis by Markovic\nand Shapiro [9]. This study will give us evidence for our claim that the entropy in a\nuniverse with a cosmological constant is bounded by an amount that is parametrically\nsmaller than the Bekenstein bound.\nBasically, the TOS model describes the dynamics of a ball of dust in the presence of\na positive cosmological constant.

This is achieved by imposing the continuity of the surface's 3-metric\nds23 = d\u03c4 2 \u2212 R2 d\u03a92 2 ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere R(\u03c4 ) = Xa(\u03c4 ), and then imposing Israel's junction conditions [14]. As shown in\n[9] these conditions lead to an equation for R(\u03c4 )\n\u1e582 + f (R) = 1 \u2212 kX 2 ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03bbR2\n2M\n\u2212\n.\n(4.8)\nR\n3\nWe want to remind the reader that we are exploring the consequences of injecting\nmore entropy than the bound given in (2.7). With that in mind we will take an S0 in\n(4.2) that exceeds the bound by requiring S0 > \u03bb\u22121/2 parametrically.\nBy comparing equations (4.7), (4.8) and (4.2) one finds a relation between the\n\"mass\" as seen from the outside, and the amount of entropy, inside the \"star\"\nf (R) = 1 \u2212\n\nM =\u03be\n\nX3\nS(a0 ) ,\nF (X)\n\n(4.9)\n\n3\n\nwhere the ratio FX(X) is bounded below by a number of O(1), independent of \u03bb.\nIf we now impose that the entropy exceeds our bound, S0 > \u03bb\u22121/2 parametrically,\nwe find that the \"mass\" is parametrically larger than \u03bb\u22121/2 , which in turn implies that\nthe function f (r) that appears in the SdS metric changes sign. At this point, the view\nof the universe as a cavity no longer applies.\n2M\n\u03bbr 2\n\u2212\n<0.\n(4.10)\nr\n3\nThis implies an exchange of roles between the radial and time coordinates in the description of the space-time geometry. The metric can then be rewritten by introducing\nT \u2261 r or T \u2261 \u2212r and y \u2261 t\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\nds2 =\n\n1\ndT 2 \u2212 g(T )dy 2 \u2212 T 2 d\u03a922 ,\ng(T )\n\n6\n\n(4.11)\n\n\fwhere\ng(T ) =\n\n\u03bbT 2 2M\n+\n\u22121 .\n3\nT\n\n(4.12)\n\nThe space-time geometry is now time dependent. The inside of the \"star\" and the\noutside geometry either both collapse to a big crunch or expand from a big bang\nsingularity. The outside geometry looks like a contracting or expanding hyper-cylinder.\nThis is rather different from the case where the entropy of the \"star\" satisfies the bound.\nWe do not expect that an increase of the entropy beyond the bound, entails such\ndrastic changes. Instead, we believe that the excess entropy will be stored, some in\nsmall black holes, but most we believe stored on the de Sitter horizon. The case\nconcerning the behavior of a \"star\" has to be contrasted with the case of black holes\nwhere the entropy storage is maximal. A somewhat related phenomenon is the case\nof the repulsion between two black holes in de Sitter space [15], with respective areas\nsmaller than a bound allowed by de Sitter space, but whose merger would have created\na black hole with size larger than the bound\nThe main point that we are trying to argue in this paper is that the entropy in\nradiation that a local observer can measure cannot exceed a bound, that is smaller\nparametrically than the Bekenstein bound. Any excess entropy gets repackaged. So\nfar we have provided circumstantial evidence for the bound and what remains to be\nshown is how this bound emerges for a local observer immersed in a universe filled with\nradiation and in the presence of a small cosmological constant. An argument for the\nbound might be based on the theorem [5] that states that there is an upper bound on\nthe entropy and hence the \"mass\" of a black hole in de Sitter space. Such a black hole\nhas a maximum \"size\" \u03bb\u22121/2 . We have seen earlier that in the absence of a cosmological\nconstant, the entropy that radiation in equilibrium can fit into a sphere of size \u03bb\u22121/2 ,\nbefore the onset of black hole formation is of O(\u03bb\u22123/4 ) . Any more entropy stored in\nradiation would need more space or be repackaged. The cosmological constant merely\nacts as a cavity which the radiation fills.\nBefore concluding it would be important to describe the observation of a local observer immersed in a geometry determined by a perfect fluid and a positive cosmological\nconstant, without using a \"star\" to obtain the bound. Although this gauge, known as\nthe \"O-gauge\", [16] can be constructed, the technical difficulty (for us) in this gauge is\nthat the dynamics is described by two dimensional partial differential equations 5 . This\nis in contrast with our use of a \"star\" where only one dimensional differential equations\nare involved.\n5\n\nsee the appendix\n\n7\n\n\f5. Conclusions\nLet us briefly recapitulate our main message: a local observer in a four dimensional\nFRW universe with a positive cosmological constant will never \"see\" more entropy\nin the microwave background than S \u223c \u03bb\u22123/4 . Any excess entropy up to O(\u03bb\u22121)\ngets processed into black holes or gets absorbed by the horizon. If we ascribe the\nobserved acceleration of our universe to a cosmological constant then the entropy in\nthe microwave background must be smaller than O(1091).\nThe local observer does not in general witness catastrophic events, he or she merely\nsees the microwave background and the occasional black hole. The experience of the\nobserver becomes drastically different in the collapsing phase if the amount of entropy\nexceeds the \"Bekenstein bound\" of O(\u03bb\u22121), he or she ends with the rest of the universe\nin a big crunch.\nThe question of why the entropy in the microwave background is O(1085) which\nis some five orders of magnitude smaller than the bound discussed in this paper remains unanswered. A plausible answer is that if there is an excess entropy produced,\nin reheating the universe, the process of repackaging that excess entropy somehow overshoots the bound. In this context it is interesting to note that the current estimate of\nthe entropy stored in black holes at the center of galaxies is O(1095). Another possible\nexplanation in the context of inflation is that the subsequent reheating of the universe\nproduces an amount of entropy short of the bound.\n\n6.

Appendix\nIn order to describe what a local observer experiences, it is useful to work in the \"Ogauge\" coordinate system which only covers the causal region that the observer. It was\nshown in [16] that given a space-time metric of the FRW form\n\u0010\n\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a(t)2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03a922\n\n8\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(7.1)\n\n\fwhere \u2212\u221e < t < \u221e and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, one can make the following coordinate transformation to a coordinate system that covers only the causal patch with a metric of the\nform\nds2 = ev (dt2 \u2212 dr 2 ) \u2212 Z 2 d\u03a922 ,\n(7.2)\nwhere v and Z are in general functions of space and time.\nR\nFirst, conformally rescale (7.1) by defining the new time coordinate \u03c4 = dt/a(t).\nThe Penrose diagram associated with the new metric is depicted below.

A point P in\nthe causal patch can be mapped to a pair of points on the observer's world-line by\nfollowing the light-like trajectories to \u03c4 + and \u03c4 \u2212 . Clearly, the following relations hold\n\u03c4 = (\u03c4 + + \u03c4 \u2212 )/2 and \u03b8 = (\u03c4 + \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 )/2.

The energy-momentum\ntensor of this fluid is given by\nT \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1 ((1 + \u03ba)U \u03bc U \u03bd + \u03bag \u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n\n9\n\n(7.4)\n\n\fwhere U is the 4-velocity of the fluid.
