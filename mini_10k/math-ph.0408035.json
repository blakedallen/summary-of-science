Introduction\nQuantum channels, which are usually described by trace preserving operations\nT : A\u2217 \u2192 B\u2217 , preadjoint to normal completely positive (CP) maps \u03a8 = T\u2217 of the\noutput algebra B = B (H) into an input operator algebra A with respect to the\nHilbert-Schmidt pairing\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh\u033a|\u03a8 (B)i := \u03c4 \u033a\u2020 \u03a8 (B) = \u03c4 T (\u033a)\u2020 A \u2261 hT (\u033a) |Bi ,\n\ncan be completely characterized in terms of their positive densities \u03a8\u03c4 with respect\nto the standard trace \u03c4 = tr on B, see for example [1]. Such densities, defined\nas non-commutative Radon-Nikodym derivatives [2] of \u03a8 with respect to \u03c4 , even\nin the case of states \u03a8 = \u03c1 are actually different from the usually used densities \u033a. The Radon-Nikodym derivative of a normal state \u03c1 on the matrix algebra\nA = B (H) with respect to the reference trace \u03c4 = tr is canonically identified by\na normal representation with not the covariant density matrix \u033a \u2208 A\u2217 but with\nthe contravariant density \u03c1\u03c4 as the complex conjugated \u03c1\u03c4 = \u033a \u0304 (or equivalently\ntransposed, \u03c1\u03c4 = \u033a \u0303) matrix in the commutant of the standard representation of\nA. In general the contravariant state densities \u03c1\u03c4 are uniquely defined as affiliated\nDate: October 15, 2003.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.\nKey words and phrases.

They are more suitable for operational generalizations than the usual, covariant densities \u03c1\u2217 = \u033a which retain only\npartial (transpose) positivity when they are replaced by covariant channel densities\n\u03a8\u2217 \u2208 A \u2297 B\u2217 defining the maps \u03a8 by the partial trace \u03a8 (B) = trB (I \u2297 B) \u03a8\u2217 . The\npositive, contravariant densities \u03a8\u03c4 describe CP maps \u03a8 by partial tracing corree \u03c4 , and they transform the contravariant input densities\nsponding to hB, \u03c3\u03c4 i = trB\u03c3\n\u03c1\u03c4 into contravariant densities \u03c3\u03c4 = \u03c2 \u0304 of output states \u03c2 = T (\u033a) by partial tracing\nh\u03a8\u03c4 , \u03c1\u03c4 i = trA \u03a8\u03c4 (\u03c1\u0303\u03c4 \u2297 IB ) .\nIn the case of infinite dimensional Hilbert space H, the channel densities \u03a8\u03c4 , unlike the state densities, might be unbounded even in the simple cse B = B (H), and\nin general should be understood in a distribution sense. Such densities were defined\nin [2] as Hermitian-positive kernels, characterized as unbounded self-adjoint operators in Stinespring representation [3] of another, dominating CP map \u03a6. In the case\nof tracial \u03a6 (B) = IA trB the channel densities \u03a8\u03c4 are defined as Hermitian-positive\nkernels affiliated to the tensor product A \u2297 B of the input channel algebra A with\nthe opposite (transposed) algebra B to the output B. The Schmidt decompositions\nof the positive densities \u03a8\u03c4 are in one-to-one correspondence with the Kraus decompositions of the channels \u03a8, and the spectral decompositions of the positive\nself-adjoint operators \u03a8\u03c4 , corresponding to the orthogonal Kraus decompositions\nof \u03a8, completely describe the properties of quantum channels in terms of their\nspectral measures on R+ .\nHere we develop a consistent metric space theory of contravariant quantum channel kernels describing quantum operations in terms of trace-pairings of the observables and the contravariant densities respectively to generalized traces, introduced\nin [1]. We discuss several distances for comparing two quantum channels \u03a6 and \u03a8,\namong them the complete boundedness (CB) distance and the complete Helinger\n(CH), or operational Bures distance, and define the complete relative fidelity of\nthese channels. All these distances, conditioned upon the input state, are explicitly\nevaluated in terms of the contravariant densities \u03a6\u03c4 , \u03a8\u03c4 of the channels. Thus,\n\u03c1\nthe CB distance is expressed as the maximum Dcb (\u03a6, \u03a8) = sup\u03c1 Dcb\n(\u03a6, \u03a8) of the\nstandard entanglement trace distance\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1/2\n\u03c1\nDcb\n(\u03a6, \u03a8) = Tr \u03c1\u2217 \u2297 IB (\u03a6\u03c4 \u2212 \u03a8\u03c4 ) \u03c1\u2217 1/2 \u2297 IB ,\n\nover the input state densities \u03c1\u2217 \u2208 A\u2217 as contravariant densities of normal states\non A. The CH distance dc (\u03a6, \u03a8) between two quantum channels \u03a6 and \u03a8 is found\n2\nas dc (\u03a6, \u03a8) /2 = 1 \u2212 fc (\u03a6, \u03a8) in terms of the minimum fc (\u03a6, \u03a8) = inf \u03c1 fc\u03c1 (\u03a6, \u03a8)\nof the standard entanglement relative fidelity\nfc\u03c1 (\u03a6, \u03a8) = Tr \u03a61/2\n(\u03c1\u2217 \u2297 Ih ) \u03a81/2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nfor a given \u03c1.

While the CH distance, as will be shown\nhere, is topologically equivalent to the CB distance between two channels, from the\n\n\fQUANTUM DENSITIES, DISTANCES AND FIDELITIES\n\n3\n\noperational and computational point of view this new (Helinger) complete distance\nhave certain advantages over the CB distance.\nNote that in the finite dimensional case one can use for discriminating of the\nchannels the standard entanglement relative fidelity with respect to the input tracial state \u03c1 corresponding to \u03c1\u2217 = d\u22121 I. In fact such fidelity has been recently\nsuggested by Raginsky [5] who used to define his fidelity relative to the maximal\nentangled state. However the corresponding fidelity distance is not equivalent to\nthe CB distance, and there is no such measure in the infinite dimensional case. The\nnormalized tracial states do not exist on type one algebras if d = \u221e, and there is no\nmaximal entangled state. We prove that our complete fidelity distance is equivalent\nto the CB distance, and give an operational interpretation of this fidelity in terms\nof a minimax problem for quantum encodings and decompositions, purifying the\nchannels, in complete parallel to Uhlman's theorem [6].\n2. Some facts and notation\nQuantum state \u03c3, identified as usual with a list of all expectations \u03c3 (A), is\ndefined as a linear normalized functional A 7\u2192 \u03c3 (A) on the algebra B (H) of all\nbounded operators A in a separable\n\u0001 Hilbert space H. The functional also satisfies\nthe positivity condition \u03c3 A\u2020 A \u2265 0 for any A \u2208 B (H) such that \u03c3 (I) = 1\nfor the identity operator I on H. As usual we shall considerP\nonly normal states\n\u03c3 (A) = hA, \u03c3i, identifying them with density operators \u03c3 =\n|ii\u03c3 ik hk| defining\nthe expectations \u03c3 (A) as sums, or the series\nX\n(2.1)\nhA, \u03c3i =\naik \u03c3 ik \u2261 aik \u03c3 ik , aik = hi|A|ki .\nik\n\nHere \u03c3 is given in an orthogonal basis of real units hi| \u2208 H and |ii = hi|\u2020 as a\nHermit-positive \u03c3 \u2265 0 matrix of \u03c3 ik = \u03c3 (|iihk|) with the unit trace\nX\n\u03c3 ii \u2261 hI, \u03c3i = 1.\nTr \u03c3 =\ni\n\nFor the reason which will be explained later we prefer to use the tensor form\nP (2.1)\nfor the bilinear pairing A and \u03c3 rather than sesquilinear form Tr \u03c3\u0304A =\n\u03c3\u0002ik aki\u0003\nwhich pairs A with the covariant form \u03c3\u0304 = [\u03c3ik ] of the density matrix \u03c3 = \u03c3 ik\nin terms of the complex conjugated elements \u03c3\u0304 ik \u2261 \u03c3ik = \u03c3 ki , coinciding with the\ntransposed ones due to \u03c3 \u2020 = \u03c3. Equivalently\n\u0002 (2.1)\n\u0003 can be written\n\u0002 \u0003 as hA, \u03c3i =\nTr \u03c3\u0303A, where \u03c3\u0303 denotes the transposed matrix \u03c3 ki . The matrix \u03c3 ik is called the\ncontravariant density of the state \u03c3 with respect to the standard trace \u03c4 = Tr. As\nwe shall see, contravariant density gives more adequate representation for quantum\nchannels than the matrix \u03c3\u0304 = [hi|\u03c3\u0304|ki] = \u03c3\u0303, and its name can be explained in terms\nof the contravariant transformations. If {vi } is an orthogonal basis of H in terms\n\u0010 \u0011\n\nof rows vi such that their Hermitian adjoints vi\u2020 form a unitary matrix U = vi\u2020 ,\nthen the quantum expectations \u03c3 (A) do not change if the corresponding densities\n\u03c3 \u2208 B\u22ba (H) are contravariantly transformed as U \u03c3U \u2020 = vi\u2020 v\u0002 k \u03c3\u0003ik with respect to the\nobservables transformation V \u2020 AV = aik v i\u2020 v k , where V = v k is given as a column\nof the complex conjugate rows v i = v\u0304i such that V\u22ba := U = Ve . (They are inversely\ntransformed in the case U = U \u2020 of the symmetric transformations Ve = V , in which\ncase U = V .)\n\n\f4\n\nVIACHESLAV BELAVKIN\n\nRecall that the linear span of the convex set S\u03c4 = S (H) of all trace-densities\n\u03c3 for normal states\n\u221a on B (H) is a Banach space B\u22ba (H) with respect to the trace\nnorm kAk\u22ba := Tr A\u2020 A, consisting of all trace class operators in H, and its dual\n\u22ba\nB\u22ba (H) , the space of all bounded functionals, coincides with B (H) with respect to\nthe pairing (2.1). Given a \u03c3 \u2208 B\u22ba (H), one can define the pair-transposed element\nA\u22ba as the functional\nA\u22ba (\u03c3) = hA, \u03c3i .\n\non the predual space B\u22ba (H) given by an operator A \u2208 B (H). Note that A\u22ba is not\nthe transposed operator in H but is described in terms of the transposed operator\ne = A\u2020 as A\u22ba (\u03c3) = Tr A\u03c3.\ne The transposition A 7\u2192 A\ne is related not to the operator\nA\nbut to the Hilbert space pairing h\u03c6\u0304, \u03c8i = h\u03c6|\u03c8i defining the vector transpose \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c8\u0303\nas the reverse to |\u03c8i 7\u2192 h\u03c8\u0304| by identifying the complex conjugate elements \u03c8\u0304 \u2208 H\nwith bra-vectors h\u03c8|.\nAll of that can be easily generalized [1] to an arbitrary operator subalgebra\nB \u2286 B (H) with the standard, or a nonstandard normal faithful semifinite trace\n[7] \u03bd when the standard one, \u03c4 = Tr, is not semifinite, e.g. is trivial on B in\nthe sense that Tr A\u2020 A = \u221e for all operators A 6= 0 from the algebra B. Such a\ntrace \u03bd is defined as a nonnormalized\nstate\u0001 on B, finite on a weakly dense part\n\u0001\n\u2020\nof B, with\nthe\nproperty\n\u03bd\nA\nA\n=\n\u03bd\nAA\u2020 and separating B in the sense that\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u03bd A A = 0 \u21d2 A = 0. A quantum system will be called semifinite if it is described\nby the semifinite algebra, i.e. admits a semifinite, not necessarily standard, trace\n\u03bd. (There exist also quantum infinite systems which are not semifinite.) The only\ndifference is that the predual space B\u22ba of contravariant densities \u03c3 with respect\nto the trace \u03bd on B may not be apart of the algebra B but a part of an opposite\nalgebra B, or, if unbounded, affiliated to B. The opposite algebra can be defined on\nthe same Hilbert space equipped with a\b complex conjugation \u03c7 7\u2192 \u03c7\u0304, i.e. isometric\ninvolution in H, as the subalgebra B = A \u2208 B (H) : A \u2208 B of complex conjugated\n\u0001\ne\u2020 . This B, equipped with the reference trace \u03bd\u0304 A := \u03bd (A), does\noperators A = A\nnot necessarily coincide with (B, \u03bd) as in\u0010the\u0011 simple case B = B (H). The \"opposite\"\ne on the opposite algebra B, defines the\ntrace \u03bc = \u03bd\u0304, coinciding with \u03bd\u0303 (A) = \u03bd A\n\u03bc-pairing\n\u0010 \u0011\ne , A \u2208 B, \u03c3 \u2208 B\u22ba ,\n(2.2)\nhA, \u03c3i\u03bc = \u03bc A\u03c3\n\ngeneralizing (2.1). Note that in\u0010 the\n\u0011 symmetric case B = B the trace \u03bc is not\ne\ndistinguished from \u03bd: \u03bd\u0304 (A) = \u03bd A = \u03bd (A).\nBelow S\u03c4 \u2286 A\u2217 denotes the convex set of all positive normalized contravariant\ndensities \u033a \u2265 0, \u03c4 (\u033a) = 1 for normal states on the von Neumann algebra A with\nrespect to a normal faithful semifinite trace \u03bb = \u03c4\u0304 . They can also be regarded\nas covariant densities, \u03c1\u2217 = \u033a \u2208 A\u2217 of the normal states \u03c1 (A) = \u03c4 (\u033aA) on the\nopposite algebra A with the reference trace \u03c4 .\n3. Quantum Bures and trace distances\nThe difference between two states \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2208 S (H) is usually measured by trace-norm\ndistance\n(3.1)\n\nD(\u03c1, \u03c3) := Tr |\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3| \u2261 k\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3k\u22ba ,\n\n\fQUANTUM DENSITIES, DISTANCES AND FIDELITIES\n\n5\n\ngiven in terms of the modulus-difference of their trace densities \u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c4 and \u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c4 .\nIt is also defined for non positive \u03c1 and \u03c3 and thus doesn't have much informationoperational meaning. Another measure of this difference is relative entropy [8]\nwhich has clearly more information-operational meaning. However the quantum\nrelative entropy is not symmetric and not unique, and is not a distance on S\u03c4 .\nThe natural operational distance between two quantum states is quantum Bures\ndistance which can be defined as the square root of the minimal Euclidean squared\ndistance\n(3.2)\n\nd (\u03c1, \u03c3)2 :=\n\ninf\n\n\u03c7\u2020 \u03c7=\u03c1,\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8=\u03c3\n\nTr (\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c8)\u2020 (\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c8) .\n\nHere the infimum is taken over all all Schmidt decompositions of the trace-densities\n\u03c1 and \u03c3. Uhlman's theorem [6] states that this infimum is actually achieved at the\n2\nvalue d (\u03c1, \u03c3) /2 = 1 \u2212 f (\u03c1, \u03c3), where\np\np\n(3.3)\nf (\u03c1, \u03c3) = Tr \u03c11/2 \u03c3\u03c11/2 =: Tr \u03c11/2 \u03c3 1/2 := Tr \u03c3 1/2 \u03c1\u03c3 1/2\n\nis the relative fidelity of the states \u03c1 and \u03c3. Note that this can obviously be written\nas the trace of the matrix\np\np\n\u221a\n\u03c11/2 \u03c11/2 \u03c3\u03c11/2 \u03c1\u22121/2 \u2261 \u03c1\u03c3 \u2261 \u03c3 \u22121/2 \u03c3 1/2 \u03c1\u03c3 1/2 \u03c3 1/2 .\n\u221a\ngiving a much simpler formula Tr \u03c1\u03c3 for the fidelity f (\u03c1, \u03c3). It is also valid even\nif \u03c1 and/or \u03c3 are not invertible as soon as the product \u03c1\u03c3 = T \u039bT \u22121 remains similar\n\u221a\nto a positive diagonal matrix \u039b to make sense of \u03c1\u03c3 = T \u039b1/2 T \u22121 .\nThus, quantum Bures distance is a noncommutative generalization of the statistical Helinger distance which in the case of the commutative \u03c1 and \u03c3 has the\nP \u2020\n\u221a \u00012\n\u221a\n\u03c8 |jihj|\u03c8\nfamiliar form Tr \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3 . Since Schmidt decompositions \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 =\ncorrespond to purifications of the states \u03c3, the infimum (3.2) has clear informationoperational meaning.\nAlthough the squared fidelity distance d2 is smaller [6] than D, they achieve\nthe same maximal value d2 = 2 = D on S (H) when f = 0, i.e. when the range\nof \u03c1 is p\northogonal to the range of \u03c3. In fact, as it follows from the inequality\nD \u2264 2 1 \u2212 f 2 , see for example [9], D cannot be larger than 2d. Thus both\ndistances are topologically equivalent,\n(3.4)\n\n2\n\nd (\u03c1, \u03c3) \u2264 D (\u03c1, \u03c3) \u2264 2d (\u03c1, \u03c3) ,\n\nand d = 0 = D iff f = 1, i.e. \u03c1 = \u03c3.\nAll of that can be easily generalized to a more general semifinite algebra B \u2282\nB (H) with respect to a trace \u03bd, inducing the (nonstandard) reference trace \u03bc = \u03bd\u0304\non the opposite algebra B, and the pairing of B with the predual space B\u22ba affiliated\nto the opposite algebra B is understood in the sense of (2.2). The only difference is\nthat the contravariant densities \u03c1 = \u03c1\u03bc , \u03c3 = \u03c3\u03bc , normalized with respect to trace\n\u03bc = \u03bd\u0304 on B, may not be bounded, but they are still uniquely described by the\npositive selfadjoint operators in H affiliated to B. The trace and the Bures distance\nformulae remain the same with the reference trace \u03bc = \u03bd\u0304 replacing the standard\ntrace, and the fidelity formula with respect to the arbitrary trace \u03bc is generalized\nto\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(3.5)\nf (\u03c1, \u03c3) = \u03bc ( \u03c1\u03c3) = \u03bc \u03c11/2 \u03c3 1/2 = \u03bc ( \u03c3\u03c1) .\n\n\f6\n\nVIACHESLAV BELAVKIN\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere \u03c1\u03c3 (and \u03c3\u03c1) is still well-defined as the function T \u039bT \u22121 of the operator\n\u221a\n\u03c1\u03c3 = T \u039bT \u22121 (and \u03c3\u03c1 = T \u039bT \u22121) as being similar to a positive diagonal operator\n\u039b with respect to a similarity transformation T . If \u03c1 and \u03c3 are invertible, one\ncan take either \u03c3 \u22121/2 U or \u03c11/2 V \u2020 as such T (respectively either \u03c1\u22121/2 V or \u03c3 1/2 U \u2020 ),\nwhere U and V are unitary transformation diagonalizing respectively \u03c3 1/2 \u03c1\u03c3 1/2 and\n\u03c11/2 \u03c3\u03c11/2 .\n4. Operational densities and quantum channels\nIn order to compare quantum channels we need to generalize these results to\nlinear completely positive (CP) trace preserving mappings \u03a6\u22ba from the predual\nspace A\u22ba of the \"Alice\" algebra A \u2286 B (g) on an input Hilbert space g into the\npredual space B\u22ba of the \"Bob\" algebra B \u2286 B (h) on the same or different output\nHilbert space h. The notation H will be kept for the Hilbert product g \u2297 h with\nthe total trace Tr = \u03c4g \u2297 \u03c4h inducing the trace \u03bb \u2297 \u03bc\u0304 on the entangled input-output\nsystem A \u2297 B as the product of the standard traces \u03bb = \u03c4g |A and \u03bc\u0304 = \u03c4h |B if\n\u03c4g = trg and \u03c4 = tr remain on these subalgebras semifinite. Otherwise we should\ntake non-standard reference traces \u03c4 on A and \u03bd on B and define \u03bb \u2297 \u03bc\u0304 as the\nopposite trace to \u03c4 \u2297 \u03bc on A\u2297B.\nAs in the case of the states it is more convenient to describe quantum channels\nby the normal unital CP operations defined as the maps \u03a6 : B \u2192 A on the output\nalgebra B into the input algebra A, like the expectations \u03c3 mapping B into the trivial\nalgebra A = C. These can always be defined as the dual \u03a6\u22ba\u22ba to \u03a6\u22ba : A\u22ba \u2192 B\u22ba with\nrespect to the \u03bb-pairing of A with A\u22ba \u03bc-pairing (2.2):\n(4.1)\n\nh\u03a6 (B) , \u03c1i\u03bb = hB, \u03a6\u22ba (\u03c1)i\u03bc\n\n\u2200\u03c1 \u2208 A\u22ba , B \u2208 B.\n\nIn particular, if \u03a6\u22ba (\u03c1) = F\u22ba \u03c1F\u22ba\u2020 , then \u03a6 (B) = F \u2020 BF , where F is the transposed\noperator to F\u22ba = Fe .\nRecall \u0001that a normal map\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u03a6 : B \u2192 A is CP iff the map I0 \u2297 \u03a6\u22ba is positive\non B\u22ba l2 \u2297 A\u22ba into B\u22ba l2 \u2297 B\u22ba , where I0 = id is the identity map on B\u22ba l2 .\nMoreover, at least in the case of the simple algebra B = B (H), \u03a6 is normal on B iff\nit is weak continuation of the CP map \u03a6|B0 (h).

This indicates that\ncovariant trace-pairing is not natural for describing quantum channelling and explains our preference to use the tensor form of the pairings corresponding to the\ncontravariant form of the trace-densities. Otherwise there would not be one-to-one\ncorrespondence between complete positivity of operations and Hermitian positivity\nof their densities as kernels.\nIn general the density \u03a6\u03bc is an unbounded Hermitian-positive operator, or even\na generalized one, defined only as a kernel of a positive Hermitian form in g \u2297 h.\nNevertheless we will still use the notations of the partial tracings\n\u03a6\u22ba (\u03c1) = h\u03a6\u03bc , \u03c1i\u03bb , \u03a6 (B) = hB, \u03a6\u03bc i\u03bc\nand write \u03bc (\u03a6\u03bc ) = hIh , \u03a6\u03bc i\u03bc , defining the channel densities by the Hermitian\npositivity and the normalization conditions\n\u03a6\u03bc \u2265 0, \u03bc (\u03a6\u03bc ) = Ig .\ncondition \u03a6 (Ih ) = Ig .

In order to find it one can use Lagrangian multiplier method. Fixing X satisfying X \u2020 X = R, Xo = R1/2 say, we can write the\nLagrangian function as\n\u0001\nl = (\u03c4 \u2297 \u03bc) X \u2020 Y + Y \u2020 X \u2212 Y \u2020 Y L ,\n\nwhere L = L\u2020 \u2208 A \u2297 B is the Lagrangian multiplier corresponding to the Hermitian\ncondition S = Y \u2020 Y = S \u2020 .

Thus Yo = XL\u22121 , where L\u22121\nshould be determined from L\u22121 X \u2020 XL\u22121 = S. Multiplying this from the left\n\u221a by X\n\u00012\nand from the right by X \u2020 this gives XL\u22121 X \u2020 = XSX \u2020 , or XL\u22121 X \u2020 = XSX \u2020 .\n\u221a\nThus, indeed Yo X \u2020 = XSX \u2020 = XYo\u2020 , and therefore\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0001\n(7.7)\n(\u03c4 \u2297 \u03bc) Yo X \u2020 + XYo\u2020 = 2 (\u03c4 \u2297 \u03bc)\nXSX \u2020 .\n\nThis extremal value is the maximal \u221a\nvalue because of convexity\nof the maximizing\n\u221a\nfunction in (7.6).
