The noise magnitude, a\n\nfew \u03bc\u03a60 Hz\u22121/2 at 1 Hz (\u03a60 is the flux quantum), scales slowly with the SQUID area, and\ndoes not depend significantly on the nature of the thin film superconductor or the substrate\non which it is deposited. The substrate is typically silicon or sapphire, which are insulators\n\nat low temperature (T ) [2]. Flux noise of similar magnitude is observed in flux [3, 4] and\nphase [5] qubits. Flux noise limits the decoherence time of superconducting, flux sensitive\nqubits making scale-up for quantum computing problematic. The near-insensitivity of noise\nmagnitude to device area [2, 5, 6] suggests the origin of the noise is local. Koch et al. [7]\nproposed a model in which electrons hop stochastically between traps with different preferential spin orientations. A broad distribution of time constants is necessary to produce a 1/f\npower spectrum [8, 9]. They found that the major noise contribution arises from electrons\nabove and below the superconducting loop of the SQUID or qubit [5, 7], and that an areal\ndensity of about 5 \u00d7 1017 m\u22122 unpaired spins is required to account for the observed noise\nmagnitude. De Sousa [10] proposed that the noise arises from spin flips of paramagnetic\ndangling bonds at the Si-SiO2 interface. Assuming an array of localized electrons, Faoro\nand Ioffe [11] suggested that the noise results from electron spin diffusion. Sendelbach et\nal. [12] showed that thin-film SQUIDs are paramagnetic, with a Curie (1/T ) susceptibility.\nAssuming the paramagnetic moments arise from localized electrons, they deduced an areal\ndensity of 5 \u00d7 1017 m\u22122 . Subsequently, Bluhm et al. [13] used a scanning SQUID microscope\nto measure the low-T paramagnetic response of (nonsuperconducting) Au rings deposited\non Si substrates, and reported an areal density of 4 \u00d7 1017 m\u22122 for localized electrons. Paramagnetism was not observed on the bare Si substrate.\nIn this Letter we propose that the local magnetic moments originate in metal-induced\ngap states (MIGS) [14] localized by potential disorder at the metal-insulator interface. At\nan ideal interface, MIGS are states in the band gap that are evanescent in the insulator and\nextended in the metal [14] (Fig.1). In reality, at a nonepitaxial metal-insulator interface\nthere are inevitably random fluctuations in the electronic potential. The MIGS are particularly sensitive to these potential fluctuations, and a significant fraction of them\u2013with single\noccupancy\u2013becomes strongly localized near the interface, producing the observed paramagnetic spins. Fluctuations [15] of these local moments yield T -independent 1/f flux noise.\n2\n\n\fTo illustrate the effects of potential fluctuations on the MIGS we start with a tight-binding\nmodel for the metal-insulator interface, consisting of the (100) face of a simple-cubic metal\nepitaxially joined to the (100) face of an insulator in a CsCl structure (Fig. 2(a)). For the\nmetal we assume a single s-orbital per unit cell and nearest neighbor (NN) hopping. For\nthe insulator we place an s-orbital on each of the two basis sites of the CsCl structure and\nassume both NN and next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping. The parameters are chosen\nso that the metal s-orbitals are at zero energy and connected by a NN hopping energy of\n-0.83 eV. The onsite energy of the orbitals on the Cs and Cl sites is taken to be -4 eV\nand 2 eV, respectively, and both the NN and NNN hopping energies are set to -0.5 eV.\nThese parameters yield a band width of 10 eV for the metal, and 8 and 4 eV band widths,\nrespectively, for the valence and conduction bands of the insulator with a band gap of 2\neV (Fig. 2(d)). These band structure values are typical for conventional metals and for\nsemiconductors and insulators. For the interface we take the hopping energy between the\nmetallic and insulating atoms closest to the interface to be -0.67 eV, the arithmetic mean\nof -0.83 and -0.5 eV.\nThe electronic structure of the ideal metal-insulator junction is calculated using a supercell [16] containing 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 metal unit cells and 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 insulator unit cells, a\ntotal of 24,000 atoms. The total density of states (DOS) of the supercell (Fig. 2(e)) shows a\nnearly flat DOS in the band gap region. The states in the insulator band gap are MIGS that\nare extended in the metal, decaying rapidly away from the interface into the insulator. Our\nmodel with a lattice constant of 0.15 nm yields an areal density of states for the MIGS of\nabout 3 \u00d7 1018 eV\u22121 m\u22122 , consistent with earlier self-consistent pseudopotential calculations\n[17].\nTo mimic the effects of interfacial randomness, we allow the onsite energy to fluctuate\nfor both metal and insulator atoms near the interface [18]. Specifically we assume an energy\n\u221a\ndistribution P (E) = (1/ 2\u03c0\u03b4)exp[\u2212(E \u2212 E0 )2 /2\u03b4 2 ], where E0 is the original onsite energy\nwithout disorder, and \u03b4 is the standard deviation. We characterize the degree of disorder by\nthe dimensionless ratio R = 2\u03b4/W , where W is the bandwidth of the metal. For those MIGS\nthat become localized, the energy cost, Ui , for double occupation is large, and we cannot\nuse a noninteracting electron approach. Instead we adopt a strategy similar to that used by\nAnderson in his calculation of local moment formation [19]. We separate the space near the\ninterface into 3 regions: (i) the perfect metal region (M), (ii) an interfacial region consisting\n3\n\n\fof 2 layers of metal unit cells and 2 layers of insulator unit cells (D) (Fig. 2(b)), and (iii) the\nperfect insulator region (I). Region (ii) is analogous to the impurity in Anderson's analysis.\nWe first compute the single-particle eigenstates, \u03c6i (r), of region D in isolation. For each\nof these states, we compute Ui (using a long-range Coulomb potential with an onsite cutoff\nof 10 eV) and the hybridization energy \u0393i due to hopping to the metal and the insulator [20].\nWith the computed values of Ui and \u0393i , we solve Anderson's equation for the spin-dependent\noccupation for each localized state | ii:\nZ\n1 EF\n\u0393i\nhni,\u03c3 i =\ndE \u2032 \u2032\n.\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n(E \u2212 Ei,\u03c3 )2 + \u0393i 2\n\n(1)\n\nHere, Ei,\u03c3 = Ei + Ui hni,\u2212\u03c3 i and \u03c3 is the spin index. The net moment associated with the\nstate is given by mi = \u03bcB |hni,\u03c3 i \u2212 hni,\u2212\u03c3 i|. Equation (1) and the associated expression for\nthe net moment of the localized states are calculated within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock\napproximation [19]. An mi 6= 0 solution is obtained only when Ui /(EF \u2212 Ei ) exceeds a\ncritical value which depends on \u0393i /(EF \u2212 Ei ). In the large Ui limit, it is more appropriate\nto start from the weak coupling limit (\u0393i = 0), where the localized state is populated by\na single electron, and treat \u0393i as a perturbation. By calculating the areal density of such\nmoment-bearing localized states we estimate the density of spin- 21 local moments.\nFigure 3 shows the calculated distribution \u03c1(E, U) in the isolated interfacial region for\nR= 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3; for each value, higher values of U correspond to\nmore localized states. As expected we see that, for any given degree of randomness, the\nstates with energy inside the insulator band gap (the MIGS) or those at the band edges are\nmost susceptible to localization. Figure 4 shows a perspective plot of the charge density of\ntwo states, with high and low values of Ui , showing the correlation between the degree of\nwavefunction localization and the value of Ui . Both states are centered in the insulator, a\ngeneral characteristic of localized states in the band gap originating from the MIGS.\nSetting the Fermi energy at the insulator midgap value, we estimate the areal density of\nspins for a given degree of randomness R. The top panel in Fig. 5 depicts the distribution\n\u03c1(E, m) of the spin moments as a function of energy. We see that for small R virtually all the\nlocal moments are derived from the MIGS. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows the calculated\nareal density of local moments versus R. Our simple model thus indicates that moderate\npotential fluctuations (R \u223c 0.15) at the interface produce an areal density of localized\nmoments comparable to experimental values [21]. Although our analysis is for a specific\n4\n\n\fmodel, we expect the general physical picture to remain valid for real materials. First, the\nformation of MIGS at a metal-insulator interface is universal, and their areal density is\nrather insensitive to the nature of the materials as discussed in supplements [20] and shown\nnumerically in Ref. [17]. Second, the formation of local moments from the combination of\nlocalized states and Coulomb interaction is a general phenomenon [19]. We also note that\nour analysis should not be significantly modified when the metal is superconducting. This\nis because the Ui for the localized states is generally much greater than the pairing gap. Of\ncourse, extended states with negligible Ui would be paired.\nGiven our picture of the origin of the localized spin- 21 moments, how do they produce\n1/f flux noise with a spectral density S\u03a6 (f ) \u221d 1/f \u03b1 ? The local moments interact via\nmechanisms such as direct superexchange and the RKKY interaction [11, 22, 23, 24] between\nthemselves, and Kondo exchange with the quasiparticles in the superconductor. This system\ncan exhibit a spin-glass transition [25], which could account for the observed susceptibility\ncusp [12] near 55 mK. For T > 55 mK, however, experiments suggest that the spins are\nin thermal equilibrium [26] and exhibit a 1/T (Curie Law) static susceptibility [12, 13].\nIn this temperature regime, for hf << kB T standard linear response theory [27] shows\nthat the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (f, T ) = A(f, T )(hf /kB T ). Here,\nP P\nA(f, T ) \u221d \u03bc \u03b1,\u03b2 P\u03b1 \u03b4(hf + E\u03b1 \u2212 E\u03b2 )|h\u03b2 | S\u03bc | \u03b1i|2, where S\u03bc is the \u03bc-th component of\nthe spin operator, \u03b1 and \u03b2 label the exact eigenstates, and P\u03b1 is the Boltzmann distribution\n\nassociated with state \u03b1. Combining the above result with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem\n[15] which relates the flux noise to \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (f, T ), namely S\u03a6 (f, T ) \u221d (kB T /hf )\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (f, T ), we\n\nconclude that the observed 1/f \u03b1 spectral density implies A(f, T ) \u221d 1/f \u03b1 (0.6 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1).\nAssuming low frequency contributions dominate the Kramers-Kronig transform, this result\nis consistent with the observed 1/T static susceptibility, and the recent measurement [28]\nshowing that flux noise in a SQUID is highly correlated with fluctuations in its inductance,\nHowever, without knowing the form of the interaction between the spins, one cannot derive\nthis behavior for A(f, T ) theoretically.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a theory for the origin of the localized magnetic moments\n\nwhich have been shown experimentally to give rise to the ubiquitous low-T flux 1/f noise\nobserved in SQUIDs and superconducting qubits. In particular we have shown that for\na generic metal-insulator interface, disorder localizes a substantial fraction of the metalinduced gap states (MIGS), causing them to bear local moments. Although MIGS have\n5\n\n\fbeen known to exist at metal-insulator interfaces for three decades, we believe this is the\nfirst understanding of their nature in the presence of strong local correlation and disorder.\nProvided T is above any possible spin glass transition, experiments show that fluctuations\nof these local moments produce a paramagnetic \u03c7\u2032 and a power-law, f -dependent \u03c7\u2032\u2032 which\nin turn leads to flux 1/f noise. It is important to realize that localized MIGS occur not\nonly at the metal-substrate interface but also at the interface between the metal and the\noxide that inevitably forms on the surface of superconducting films such as aluminum and\nniobium. There are a number of open problems, for example, the precise interaction between\nthe local moments, its relation to the value of \u03b1, and the possibility of a spin glass phase\nat low temperature. A particularly intriguing experimental issue to address is why different\nmetals and substrates evidently have such similar values of R, around 0.15. Experimentally,\nto improve the performance of SQUIDs and superconducting qubits we need to understand\nhow to control and reduce the disorder at metal-insulator interfaces, for example, by growing\nthe superconductor epitaxially on its substrate.\nWe thank R.McDermott and K.A.Moler for prepublication copies of their papers.

In\na two-band tight-binding model [30], the amplitude squared of the evanescent solutions [31]\nclose to the valence band edge has an energy-dependent decay length \u03b2(E) = 2[2m\u2217 (E \u2212\nEV BM )/h\u03042 ]1/2 , where m\u2217 is the electron effective mass and EV BM is the energy of the valence\n\nband maximum. Near the conduction band edge ECBM , \u03b2(E) = 2[2m\u2217 (ECBM \u2212 E)/h\u03042 ]1/2 .\nThe areal density N of MIGS in the insulator (in units of states per unit area) is given by\n[14]\nN=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nEF\n\ndE\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u03b2(E)z\n\ndz\u03b7(E)e\n\n=\u03b7\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nEF\n\n0\n\ndE\n\n1\n\u03b2(E)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we have assumed the density of states \u03b7(E) of the metal to be constant over the\nenergy range of the band gap. Inserting the expression for \u03b2(E) into Eq.(2), we obtain\nN = \u03b7[(h\u03042 /2m\u2217 )(EF \u2212 EV BM )]1/2\n\n(3)\n\nFor most semiconductors and insulators [32], me /m\u2217 \u2248 1 + C1 /Eg and EF \u2212 EV BM = C2 Eg\nwith C1 \u2248 10 eV and C2 \u2248 0.5; furthermore, for most metals \u03b7(E) is of the same of order\nof magnitude. Consequently, the approximate expression\nN \u2248 \u03b7[(h\u03042 /2me )C1 C2 ]1/2\n\n(4)\n\nis relatively insensitive to the nature of both the metal and the insulator. Using the typical\nvalues \u03b7(E) \u2248 2 \u00d7 1028 m\u22123 eV\u22121 and C1 C2 \u2248 5eV, we obtain N \u2248 8 \u00d7 1018 m\u22122 , in good\nagreement with pseudopotential calculation [17] for Al in contact with Si, GaAs or ZnS.\nHubbard energy Ui . We calculate the Hubbard energy Ui for double occupation for\nstates in the isolated D region by evaluating the integral\nZ\n|\u03c6i,\u2191(r)|2 |\u03c6i,\u2193 (r\u2032 )|2\nUi =\ndrdr\u2032\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\nD\n\n(5)\n\nover the supercell. Within our tight-binding supercell scheme, two additional factors need to\nbe included. (i) The part of the Coulomb integral on the same atomic site is replaced with\nthe value of an onsite Hubbard U0 . (ii) When the localization length (\u03be) of the localized\nstates is larger than the supercell size, there is overlap of wavefunctions from the neighboring supercell; this overestimates Ui for the very weakly localized states. Given that the\nP\nparticipation number, Pi = 1/ j |\u03c6i (rj )|4 \u223c (\u03bei /a)d in a disordered d-dimensional system\n7\n\n\fwith supercell lattice constant a and Ui \u221d 1/\u03bei , we map the Ui value of the finite supercell\nonto that of an infinite supercell using a scaling law [33] for \u03be.\nHybridization energy broadening \u0393i . The hybridization-energy broadening of the\nlocalized states arises from couplings to the extended states in the metal as well as those in\nthe insulator, and is given by\n\u0393i = \u0393iM + \u0393iI\n\n(6)\n\n\u0393iM = \u03c0|ViM |2ave \u03c1M (E), \u0393iI = \u03c0|ViI |2ave \u03c1I (E)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c1M (I) (E) is the density of extended states in M (I) at the energy of the localized\nM (I)\n\nstate E, and Vi\n\nis the hopping matrix element between an extended state in M(I) and a\n\nlocalized state in D (ave indicates averaging over the extended states). Extended eigenstates\nM (I)\n\nin M(I) are a linear combination of constituent orbitals; the Vi\n\ncan then be expressed\n\nin terms of the coupling of these orbitals to those in D. For example, the localized states\ninside the band gap of the insulator are hybridized with only extended states in M, and\n\u0393i = \u0393iM \u2248 \u03c0V 2 di /W . (Here di is the charge of the localized state | ii in the unit cell layer\nimmediately adjacent to M.)\n\n8\n\n\f\u2217\n\nElectronic address: jclarke@berkeley.edu\n\n[1] J.Clarke and A.I.Braginski, The SQUID Handbook (Wiley-VCH, GmbH and Weinheim, 2004),\nVol. 1.\n[2] F.C.Wellstood, C.Urbina, and J.Clarke, Appl.
