The importance of having accurate solar elemental abundances can thus not be overstated. From the pioneering efforts\nof Russell (1929), Suess & Urey (1956) and Goldberg, M\u00fcller & Aller (1960) to\nthe more recent works of Anders & Grevesse (1989), Grevesse & Sauval (1998),\nLodders (2003), Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005), Grevesse, Asplund & Sauval\n(2007) and Lodders, Palme & Gail (2009) compilations of the solar system abundances have found extremely wide-ranging use in astronomy and cosmology.\nThere are two independent and complementary ways of determining the solar\nsystem abundances, each with its pros and cons. Through mass spectroscopy\nof meteorites in terrestrial laboratories, it is possible to directly measure the\nabundance of almost every element and isotope with remarkable precision. The\nmost pristine meteorites are the so-called CI chondrites, which have been modified\nleast by various physical and chemical processes over the past 4.56 Gyr. Even in\nthese meteorites volatile elements have been depleted to various degrees, including\n\n2\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n3\n\nthe six most abundant elements: hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and\nneon. As a consequence, it is not possible to rely on meteorites to determine\nthe primordial solar system abundances for such elements. This also implies\nthat one must measure all meteoritic abundances relative to an element other\nthan hydrogen, traditionally chosen to be silicon. Prior knowledge of the solar\nphotospheric Si abundance is therefore required in order to place the meteoritic\nabundances on the same absolute scale as the Sun (Suess & Urey 1956).\nWith the exception of a general \u223c 10% modification due to diffusion and gravitational settling (Sect. 3.11) and depletion of lithium and possibly beryllium,\ntoday's photospheric abundances are believed to reflect those at the birth of the\nsolar system. They are of profound importance for the understanding of our own\nsolar system and the Sun's interior structure and evolution. Unfortunately, photospheric abundances cannot be determined with the same accuracy as those from\nmeteorites. In particular, very little isotopic abundance information is available.\nFurthermore, photospheric abundances are not observed but inferred. Thus the\nsolar spectrum must be interpreted using realistic models of the solar atmosphere\nand spectrum formation process. In addition, the required atomic and molecular\ndata are rarely precise enough to rival the accuracy of meteoritic measurements.\nIn spite of the remaining uncertainties in solar photospheric determinations, having access to the most accurate solar abundances possible is crucial, not only for\nunderstanding our own Sun but also in order to make meaningful comparisons\nwith other stars (for which meteoritic information is obviously unavailable). The\nSun is also the only possible reference for the interstellar medium, H ii regions\nand other galaxies when studying the elements depleted in meteorites.\nIn the decade since the appearance of the widely-used compilation of the solar chemical composition by Grevesse & Sauval (1998), the abundances of a large\nnumber of elements have been revised, several rather severely (e.g. Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval\n2005). This is true in particular for C, N, O and Ne. There are three main reasons\nfor the changes: improvements in atomic and molecular transition probabilities,\nthe advent of 3D hydrodynamical solar model atmospheres and relaxation of\nthe assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium in the spectral line formation. Several of the proposed abundance alterations have not gone unchallenged,\nhowever. It is therefore timely to now critically assess the reference solar chemical composition and make recommendations regarding the most accurate values\navailable to the astronomical community. After recapitulating the necessary ingredients in any solar abundance analysis (Sect. 2), we discuss in detail the solar\nchemical composition on an element-by-element basis (Sect. 3). We also present\na comparison between photospheric solar abundances and those inferred by alternative means, such as via meteorites and stars or gas in the solar neighborhood\n(Sect. 4). We conclude by summarizing the main points and outlining a few open\nissues for the future (Sect. 5).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nINGREDIENTS FOR SOLAR ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS\nObservations\n\nAnalyses of the solar photospheric chemical composition make use of the elemental fingerprints present in the solar spectrum in the form of spectral absorption lines. There are several solar atlases of both intensity and flux spectra\nin the ultraviolet, optical and infrared regions. The most commonly used opti-\n\n\f4\n\nAsplund et al.\n\ncal disk-center intensity spectra of the quiet Sun are the so-called Jungfraujoch\nor Li\u00e8ge atlas (after its locations of observation and production, respectively;\nDelbouille, Roland & Neven 1973) and the Kitt Peak solar atlas (Neckel & Labs\n1984). The spectral resolving power of the latter is slightly higher while the former is less affected by telluric absorption due to the higher observing altitude.\nThere are also corresponding infrared disk-center intensity atlases observed from\nKitt Peak (Delbouille et al. 1981) and from the atmos experiment flown on the\nspace shuttle (Abrams et al. 1996, Farmer & Norton 1989). Finally, the solar flux\nspectrum has recently been re-reduced by Kurucz (2006); see also Kurucz et al.\n(1984) for an earlier rendition of the same Kitt Peak solar data set. All solar\natlases agree very well with each other except for spectral regions afflicted by\ntelluric features. Thus the quality of observations is in general not a source of\nsignificant error in solar abundance analyses.\n\n2.2\n\nAtomic and molecular data\n\nA critical ingredient in any solar abundance analysis is of course the atomic\nand molecular line input data. Of these the transition probability is the most\nobvious, but there are a raft of other required components that are not always as well-determined as one would hope. These include line broadening,\nhyperfine and isotopic splitting, dissociation energies and partition functions.\nMuch laudable work has been done in improving the gf -values for a large number of transitions (e.g. Johansson et al. 2003, Kurucz 1992, Lawler et al. 2006,\nSobeck, Lawler & Sneden 2007) but still several elements and lines have surprisingly uncertain transition probabilities. Another important advancement in recent years is that it is now possible to accurately compute the self-broadening\n(also known as van der Waals broadening) of metal lines (Anstee & O'Mara 1995,\nBarklem & Aspelund-Johansson 2005, Barklem, Piskunov & O'Mara 2000a), which\nhas made the classical Uns\u00f6ld broadening and its ad-hoc enhancement factors\nlargely obsolete, at least for neutral species.\nThe need for atomic data increases dramatically when relaxing the LTE assumption. In non-LTE calculations one needs transition data not only for the\nline in question but in principle for all other lines of the element. In addition,\nphoto-ionization cross-sections play a crucial role. There have been noteworthy improvements in this respect in recent years through the Opacity and Iron\nProjects (Badnell et al. 2005) for example, but unfortunately the lack of quantum mechanical calculations for most elements preclude detailed non-LTE investigations. The most unsatisfactory situation, however, relates to collisional\ncross-sections for excitation and ionization, for which laboratory or theoretical\ncalculations are completely missing bar for a few elements and transitions relevant for spectroscopy of late-type stars (e.g. Barklem 2007a, Belyaev & Barklem\n2003). In the absence of realistic evaluations, classical recipes such as those of\nvan Regemorter (1962) and Drawin (1968) are frequently used but cannot be\nexpected to be more than order-of-magnitude estimates at best. Often scaling\nfactors to these formulae are used, sometimes calibrated by achieving an optimal overall fit to the various spectral features. It should remembered that such\na procedure may reveal less about the true collisional cross-sections than about\nother shortcomings in the modelling of the stellar atmospheres and line formation\n(Asplund 2005).\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n2.3\n\n5\n\nSolar atmospheric and line formation modelling\n\nExtracting information about the Sun's chemical composition from the solar spectrum requires realistic models of the solar atmosphere and the line formation process. Traditional solar and stellar abundance analyses employ one-dimensional\n(1D) model atmospheres assuming time-independence and hydrostatic equilibrium. Such models come in two flavours: theoretical and semi-empirical. The\nformer are constructed assuming a constant total (radiative plus convective) energy flux through the atmosphere, which dictates the temperature stratification\ngiven the adopted equation-of-state and opacities. Convective energy transport\nis normally described by the mixing length theory (B\u00f6hm-Vitense 1958). The\nradiative flux is determined by solving the radiative transfer equation, typically\nunder the simplification of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To achieve\na realistic temperature structure, treatment of the combined effects of spectral\nlines ('line blanketing') must be as complete as possible. The most widely-used\ntheoretical 1D model atmospheres for solar-type stars are the Kurucz (1993) and\nmarcs (Gustafsson et al. 2008) grids of models.\nSemi-empirical models are often the preferred choice for solar spectroscopists.\nIn these models, temperatures are inferred from depth-dependent observations\nsuch as the center-to-limb variation of the continuum and/or lines with differing formation heights. The resulting atmospheric structure is thus sensitive to\nthe ingredients involved in the inversion process, such as LTE for the continuum and line formation, and the adopted line data. Hydrostatic equilibrium\nis still assumed in semi-empirical models, but the flux constancy criterion does\nnot need to be obeyed nor is it necessary to estimate convective energy transport. Several semi-empirical solar models are on the market, including the\nHolweger & M\u00fcller (1974), val3c (Vernazza, Avrett & Loeser 1976) and miss\n(Allende Prieto et al. 2001) models. The favoured model of solar abundance\naficionados is the Holweger & M\u00fcller model, partially because its temperature\nstratification is expected to be an accurate representation of the real photosphere\n\u2013 but also partially just by habit. Indeed it is somewhat surprising that the val3c\nmodel or its successors (e.g. Fontenla et al. 2006) have not caught on more within\nthe solar abundance community, since they are built on similar premises but without the LTE restriction. The venerable Holweger & M\u00fcller model in fact dates\nback more than forty years, since the 1974 version was simply a new pressureintegration of the original Holweger (1967) model using updated equation-of-state\nand continuous opacities. It was constructed to match the observed continuum\ncenter-to-limb variation as well as the line depths of some 900 lines of varying\nstrengths, under the assumption of LTE. Due to the limited spectral resolution\nof the solar spectrum used by Holweger, one would expect the temperatures to\nbe overestimated by about 50 K in the line-forming region. Interestingly, the corrected version of such a temperature structure would be more similar to the miss\nsemi-empirical model (Allende Prieto et al. 2001); both semi-empirical models\nhave a shallower temperature gradient than 1D theoretical model atmospheres,\nas seen in Fig. 1. It should be borne in mind that there exists an ambiguity when\nemploying any 1D model: while many simply adopt temperatures, pressures and\ndensities directly from the published model, a more correct procedure is to perform a pressure-integration using only the temperature structure as a function of\ncontinuum optical depth, in order to be consistent with the opacities computed\nwith the spectrum synthesis code one employs.\n\n\f6\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nMore recently it has become tractable to perform 3D, time-dependent, hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar surface convection (e.g. Asplund et al. 1999,\nFreytag, Steffen & Dorch 2002, Stein & Nordlund 1998, V\u00f6gler, Bruls & Sch\u00fcssler\n2004). Here the standard conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy\nare solved together with the 3D radiative transfer equation in a small but representative volume of the stellar atmosphere. Radiative energy exchange with\nthe gas in the surface layers is crucial, because this is what drives the convective motions. Because of the much more computationally demanding nature of\nsuch hydrodynamical modelling, approximations must be made in the radiative\ntransfer treatment. Rather than solving for many thousands of frequency points\nas regularly done in theoretical 1D hydrostatic models, the wavelength variation of opacity is represented by a small number of typical opacity bins (4-20)\nin order to compute the radiative heating/cooling rate that enters the energy\nequation (Nordlund 1982). Detailed comparisons with the monochromatic solution reveal that this scheme is surprisingly accurate. The reader is referred\nto Nordlund, Stein & Asplund (2009) for a recent review of the physics of solar\nsurface convection and the numerical details of its simulation.\nA few different 3D hydrodynamical solar model atmospheres have been constructed and employed for abundance purposes (e.g. Asplund et al. 2000b, Caffau et al.\n2008a, Trampedach et al. 2009). While these are computed with different codes,\nthey are based on many of the same physical assumptions and approximations.\nIt is therefore not too surprising that the resulting atmospheric structures are\nsimilar. The 3D models have been computed using realistic and comprehensive\nequation-of-state, continuous and line opacities. The numerical resolution is sufficiently high to adequately resolve the granulation, albeit obviously not high\nenough to reach down to the microscopic viscous dissipation length-scales. The\nreason that these so-called 'large-eddy' simulations are nevertheless quite successful in reproducing the real photosphere is that the mean stratification is largely\nindependent of numerical resolution (Asplund et al. 2000a, Stein & Nordlund\n1998). Spectral line formation is heavily biased to the upflows, which have a\nlow degree of turbulence in comparison to the downflows, due to the divergent\nflow. Obviously none of the mixing length parameters required in 1D models\nenter into 3D simulations, as the convective energy flux is instead a natural consequence of the hydrodynamics.\nHaving a suitably realistic solar model atmosphere, the next step when trying\nto infer the solar chemical composition is to model how the spectrum is formed. In\norder to derive an abundance of an element, solar spectroscopists either measure\nthe total observed line strength as defined by the equivalent width, or directly\ncompare the observed and theoretical spectra through the fitting of line profiles.\nFinally, to compute the line strength requires knowledge of the level populations.\nIn LTE, these follow straightforwardly from the local temperature and electron\npressure using the Boltzmann and Saha distributions. In general this rather\nsevere simplification cannot be expected to be valid, and the non-LTE case must\ninstead be considered. While non-LTE is a general term covering all situations\nwhen LTE is not valid, in practice all calculations referred to herein assume\nstatistical equilibrium, i.e. the level populations do not change with time. NonLTE thus requires a simultaneous solution of the rate equations for all relevant\nlevels and species together with the radiative transfer equation for all relevant\nwavelengths. We refer to Asplund (2005) for a detailed account of the principles\nof non-LTE and the most important non-LTE effects encountered for late-type\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n7\n\nstars like the Sun.\n\n2.4\n\nObservational constraints on solar modelling\n\nSince more sophisticated modelling does not automatically imply a more realistic\noutcome, it is of paramount importance to carefully test the predictions of the\n3D model atmospheres against an arsenal of observational diagnostics. This is\nespecially true given that 1D model atmospheres more often than not fail the very\nsame tests. Current generations of 3D models are very successful in reproducing\nthe observed solar granulation topology, typical length- and time-scales, convective velocities and intensity brightness contrast (e.g. Nordlund, Stein & Asplund\n2009, Stein & Nordlund 1998), clearly none of which 1D models are able to predict.\nAnother important constraint is the center-to-limb variation of the continuum as a function of wavelength. Ayres, Plymate & Keller (2006) have criticized\nthe 3D hydrodynamical model of Asplund et al. (2000b), oft used in recent solar abundance analyses, for having too steep a temperature gradient as judged\nby the observed center-to-limb variation. Koesterke, Allende Prieto & Lambert\n(2008) reach a somewhat milder conclusion, presumably because they performed\nspectral synthesis with the full 3D model rather than with only the spatiallyaveraged version used by Ayres, Plymate & Keller. The 3D co5bold solar model\nof Caffau et al. (2008a) appears to perform better in this respect (H. Ludwig,\nprivate communication). In the present work, we make extensive use of the\n3D solar model by Trampedach et al. (2009), which has been constructed with\nan improved treatment of the radiative transfer and updated opacities. Because of its somewhat shallower temperature stratification than the 3D model\nof Asplund et al. (Fig. 1), the new 3D model satisfies the center-to-limb variation constraint very well, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Indeed it outperforms all\n1D models, even the semi-empirical (Holweger & M\u00fcller 1974) model, which was\ndesigned to fit this diagnostic (Pereira et al. 2009).\nThe wings of the hydrogen Balmer lines are also sensitive tracers of the temperature stratification in the deeper layers of the photosphere. In recent years, significant improvements have been made in the treatment of the broadening of H lines,\nespecially self-broadening (Allard et al. 2008; Barklem, Piskunov & O'Mara 2000b).\nIt is still unclear whether noticeable non-LTE effects can be expected in the\nsolar atmosphere, since available calculations for the cross-sections of inelastic\nH+H collisions are uncertain (Barklem 2007b). With 1D theoretical model atmospheres, the H lines imply too low Teff for the Sun by 50 \u2212 100 K, and have\nthe wrong line shapes when the most accurate line broadening data are used\n(Barklem et al. 2002). Such problems can be partly cured by playing with the\nmixing length parameters, however. In contrast, the H lines suggest that the temperature gradient of the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) semi-empirical model is too\nshallow. Pereira et al. (2009) found that the 3D solar model of Trampedach et al.\n(2009) reproduces the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines very well in LTE, doing so significantly\nbetter than the 1D models they investigated, but without requiring the tweaking\nof any free parameters. The co5bold model has to our knowledge not yet been\ntested against H lines.\nAs seen in Fig. 3, with 3D hydrodynamical models for the solar atmosphere it\nis now possible to achieve highly satisfactory agreement with observed profiles of\ntypical weak and intermediate strong lines (the wings of strong lines reveal more\n\n\f8\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nabout the pressure broadening data than the employed model atmosphere). It is\nimportant to remember that this is achieved without invoking the free parameters\nnecessary in any 1D analysis (micro- and macroturbulence) in the line formation\ncalculations. Such line broadening can thus be explained as the result of the\nDoppler shift arising from the convective motions with a smaller contribution\nfrom the solar oscillations (e.g Nordlund, Stein & Asplund 2009, and references\ntherein). Indeed, even the observed line shifts and asymmetries are very well\nreproduced with 3D models (e.g. Asplund et al. 2000b). The co5bold solar\nmodel produces good overall line profiles (e.g. Caffau et al. 2008a) but whether\nthis extends also to line asymmetries has not yet been investigated.\nIn summary, the 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere (Trampedach et al.\n2009) that we draw results from in this review outperforms 1D model atmospheres\nin the available observational tests, from granulation topology and center-to-limb\nvariation to H lines and the detailed profiles of metallic lines. For the purposes\nof photospheric abundance determinations, the 3D solar model employed here\nappears to be a very realistic representation of the solar photosphere. No large\ndifferences are expected from using our 3D model or the corresponding co5bold\nmodel (Caffau et al. 2008a) given their overall similarities.\n\n3\n\nPHOTOSPHERIC ABUNDANCES\n\nOur recommended solar photospheric elemental abundances are listed in Table\n1, which also provides the corresponding meteoritic values for CI chondrites to\nbe discussed in Sect. 4.1. [Throughout this review, we adopt the customary\nastronomical scale for logarithmic abundances where hydrogen is defined to be\nlog \u01ebH = 12.00, i.e. log \u01ebX = log(NX /NH ) + 12, where NX and NH are the number\ndensities of element X and hydrogen, respectively.] Fig. 4 shows how the solar\nabundances vary with atomic number, illustrating several key features of nuclear\nand stellar physics: the high primordial H and He abundances; the fragile nature\nof Li, Be and B; the relatively high abundance of elements involved in stellar H-,\nHe- and C-burning, modulated by the odd-even effect and the \u03b1-capture effect;\nthe high nuclear binding energy and near nuclear statistical equilibrium for the\nFe-peak; and the production of the heavy elements through successive neutron\ncapture with peaks around the magic nuclei possessing closed neutron shells (e.g.\nPagel 1997).\nIn this review, we have attempted to reanalyse the solar abundances of (nearly)\nall elements in a homogeneous manner with the best possible atomic data and\nstate-of-the-art solar modelling. As a guiding principle, we have been very discerning when selecting the lines for each element, since inclusion of dubious lines\nonly increases the abundance scatter and tends to skew the results towards higher\nabundances due to blends. The analysis has been carried out using several 1D\nand 3D model atmospheres and with non-LTE effects accounted for whenever\npossible, all done with the same well-tested computer codes. Unless specified\notherwise, the results presented here have been based on the 3D hydrodynamical\nsolar model atmosphere of Trampedach et al. (2009). Below we present in some\ndetail how the abundances were derived but the full description of the analysis\n(including line lists with all the relevant data for the transitions) will appear\nin a forthcoming series of articles in Astronomy & Astrophysics (Asplund et al.\n2009a,b,c, Grevesse et al. 2009, Sauval et al. 2009, Scott et al. 2009b).\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n9\n\nThere are a wide range of potential sources of error in solar and stellar abundance analyses, from inaccurate input data for the transition (gf -values, line\nbroadening etc) to difficulties in estimating line strengths (finite S/N , continuum\nplacement, blends etc), to inadequacies in the atmospheric and line-formation\nmodelling (1D, LTE, mixing length and microturbulence parameters, continuous\nopacities, etc). No consensus exists in the solar abundance literature on how the\nuncertainties should be quantified. Some authors have used the standard deviation arising from the chosen sample of lines to represent the total error for a\ngiven species whilst others have employed the standard error of the mean or some\ndifferent measure altogether. Previous compilations of the solar chemical composition contained a mixture of different error estimates, since the values were\ntaken from sources with differing modus operandi.\nWe have attempted to quantify three possible systematic errors introduced\nby the modelling: mean atmospheric stratification, atmospheric inhomogeneities\nand departures from LTE. The first uncertainty has been estimated by taking half\nthe difference between the results with the spatially-averaged 3D model (denoted\n<3D>) and the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model. The second has been evaluated\nas half the difference between the full 3D results and those from <3D>. The inclusion of the theoretical marcs (Gustafsson et al. 2008) and semi-empirical miss\n(Allende Prieto et al. 2001) models serves as a further check on these two systematic errors. Due to the general lack of non-LTE calculations for the majority\nof elements, the non-LTE uncertainty is more difficult to quantify. Somewhat\narbitrarily, in most cases we have chosen half of the predicted non-LTE abundance correction as an estimate of the error. Occasionally we have employed\nthe difference between the cases with and without inelastic H collisions through\nthe Drawin (1968) formula, whilst taking into account the recommendations by\nAsplund (2005). We have used an arbitrary, minimal estimate of the possible\nerrors in the non-LTE corrections of 0.03 dex. In some cases this might overestimate the non-LTE systematic error, whilst in others (e.g. Ti i) it probably\nunderestimates the error; there is unfortunately no other consistent way to include such unknown errors. Estimating possible systematic errors arising from\ninappropriate line input data has not been attempted here; relative errors in\ngf -values will at least be accounted for in the dispersion of the lines. When\nthe elemental abundance is determined by only one or very few lines, we have\nattempted to estimate an additional error arising from uncertainties due to continuum placement and possible blends. The systematic errors have been added\nin quadrature with the statistical error to estimate the total uncertainty, which\nis used throughout the article unless specified otherwise. The statistical error\nhas been computed from the weighted standard error of the mean, with weights\nassigned to each line according to uncertainties in the continuum placement and\nknown or suspected minor blends.\n\n3.1\n\nLithium, Beryllium and Boron\n\nLithium: In the Sun, Li is depleted by about a factor of 150 compared with\nthe already small meteoritic value. Even the Li i resonance line at 670.8 nm is\ntherefore very weak. The line is blended by an assortment of CN and Fe i lines,\nwhich makes the Li abundance determination very challenging. Because the\ntransition arises from the ground state of a minority species, the line is sensitive\nto both the temperature and photo-ionizing UV radiation field (Asplund 2005,\n\n\f10\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nKiselman 1997). The recommended value given in Table 1 stems from the analysis of M\u00fcller, Peytremann & de La Reza (1975), which has been corrected for the\neffects of atmospheric inhomogeneities and 3D non-LTE effects (Asplund et al.\n1999, Barklem, Belyaev & Asplund 2003). The solar Li depletion cannot be explained by standard models based on the mixing length theory of convection but\nrequires additional mixing below the convection zone (Brun, Turck-Chi\u00e8ze & Zahn\n1999; Charbonnel & Talon 2005).\nBeryllium: Early work implied that Be was depleted in the solar convection\nzone by about a factor of two (Chmielewski, Brault & M\u00fcller 1975). This interpretation was challenged by Balachandran & Bell (1998), who argued that one\nmust take into account the long-suspected missing UV opacity (e.g. Short & Hauschildt\n2005, and references therein) in synthesizing the Be ii resonance lines at 313 nm.\nThey estimated the amount of missing opacity by requiring that the nearby OH\nelectronic lines would return the same O abundance as the OH vibrational lines\nin the infrared, which increased the derived photospheric Be abundance to the\nmeteoritic value. The required extra opacity can be largely attributed to photoionization of Fe i (Bell, Balachandran & Bautista 2001). The Balachandran & Bell\nanalysis was corroborated by Asplund (2004), who found that the basic conclusions are independent of the adopted model atmosphere, whether 1D or 3D. The\nBe ii lines are not sensitive to non-LTE effects in the Sun (Asplund 2005).\nBoron: The problem of the missing UV opacity may also impact the solar\nB abundance determination, which can realistically only be based on the B i\n249.7 nm resonance line. Cunha & Smith (1999) have re-analysed the line with\ncareful consideration of the important Mg i photo-ionization cross-sections. The\neffects of departures from LTE (Kiselman & Carlsson 1996) and 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres (Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval 2005) are small and\nopposite in sign. There is still a large uncertainty attached to the resulting abundance, log \u01ebB = 2.70\u00b10.20, due to the difficulty in analysing this crowded spectral\nregion. Not surprisingly, B does not appear depleted in the solar photosphere.\n\n3.2\n\nCarbon\n\nThe solar carbon abundance can be inferred from a wealth of indicators, from lowexcitation forbidden and high-excitation permitted atomic lines to various molecular transitions of CH, C2 and CO (Lambert 1978). This fortunate circumstance\nhas not translated into a well-determined abundance over the years as the different diagnostics have often yielded discrepant results. The preliminary abundance\nlog \u01ebC = 8.56 \u00b1 0.04 recommended by Anders & Grevesse (1989) eventually became 8.60\u00b10.05 in the final analysis of Grevesse et al. (1991). Grevesse & Sauval\n(1998) based their value of 8.52 \u00b1 0.06 on an unpublished analysis employing a\nHolweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model with a modified temperature structure, in an\nattempt to remove existing trends with excitation potential and equivalent widths\nfor C, N, O and Fe. Over the past decade the solar C abundance has undergone\nan even more drastic downward revision. Allende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund\n(2002) reanalysed the [C i] 872.7 nm line and found that the combination of a\n3D hydrodynamical solar model (Asplund et al. 2000b) and an updated gf -value\nbrought the abundance down to 8.39 \u00b1 0.04. The same value was obtained by\nAsplund et al. (2005), who also employed C i, C2 and CH electronic and vibration lines using the same 3D model. Convincingly, all indicators gave consistent\nresults, further strengthening the case for the reality of the low C abundance.\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n11\n\nIn sharp contrast, the abundances estimated with the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974)\nmodel atmosphere disagreed by \u2248 0.2 dex. The presence of temperature inhomogeneities and a cooler mean temperature structure in the 3D model compared with\nthe previously employed Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model reduced the deduced\nabundance from the molecular lines in particular, while significant departures\nfrom LTE had a similar effect on the C i lines. Using weak lines of the extremely\ntemperature-sensitive CO molecule and a self-consistently derived O abundance,\nScott et al. (2006) corroborated this finding. They also determined an isotopic\nratio of 12 C/13 C = 86.8 \u00b1 3.8.\nThe value we recommend here, log \u01ebC = 8.43 \u00b1 0.05, is slightly higher than in\nAsplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005) and stems from the mean of the 3D-based\nresults for [C i], C i, CH and C2 lines (Asplund et al. 2009a). As illustrated in\nTable 2, the various C indicators imply highly uniform abundances. With the\nexception of a correlation between derived abundance and line strength for C i,\nthere are no trends with transition properties such as excitation potential or\nequivalent width for any of the species. A similar trend was also present in\nAsplund et al. (2005), which was attributed to underestimated non-LTE effects\nfor the stronger lines (Fabbian et al. 2006). We note that only 1D non-LTE\nabundance corrections have been employed for the C i results while the departures from LTE are expected to be exacerbated in the presence of atmospheric\ninhomogeneities (Asplund 2005); a full 3D non-LTE study for C would clearly\nbe worthwhile. Given the importance of this abundant element, it is essential\nthat the results of Asplund et al. (2009a) are confirmed by an independent group\nusing an independent 3D model, akin to the analysis of the solar O abundance\n(Caffau et al. 2008a).\n\n3.3\n\nNitrogen\n\nThe nitrogen abundance can be determined from both atomic and molecular\nlines, although the forbidden [N i] lines are too weak in the solar spectrum to\nbe measurable (Grevesse et al. 1990). A preliminary N abundance was given\nin Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005) using high excitation N i lines and NH\nvibration-rotation lines in the infrared while in the final analysis (Sauval et al.\n2009) also NH pure rotation lines and a multitude of transitions from various\nbands of CN were considered in the framework of an improved 3D model. The\nnon-LTE effects for N i are relatively small: \u2248 \u22120.05 dex when ignoring H collisions (Caffau et al. 2009). In their own analysis of these very weak N i lines\nusing their co5bold 3D solar model, Caffau et al. (2009) obtained a N i-based\nabundance which is 0.05 dex higher than the corresponding value in Sauval et al.\n(2009), largely due to the selection of lines. They included many lines that we\nconsider to be of dubious value due to known or suspected blends. This is also\nreflected in the dramatically different standard deviations for the N i lines in the\ntwo studies: \u03c3 = 0.04 and 0.12 dex, respectively. Sauval et al. (2009) found very\ngood agreement between abundances inferred from N i and NH lines, with very\nsmall dispersion in the NH results. The different CN bands also gave very similar results when employing a self-consistently derived C abundance with the 3D\nmodel. Unfortunately, Caffau et al. (2009) did not consider molecular lines and it\nis therefore not known how well their 3D model performs in achieving consistent\nresults for atoms and molecules. It is sometimes stated in the literature that the\nmolecular lines are more temperature sensitive than atomic lines, but in fact the\n\n\f12\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nNH lines are less so than these highly excited N i lines.\nThe N abundance from Sauval et al. (2009) that we recommend here, log \u01ebN =\n7.83 \u00b1 0.05, is 0.09 dex lower than suggested by Grevesse & Sauval (1998) and\n0.22 dex lower than in Anders & Grevesse (1989).\n\n3.4\n\nOxygen\n\nOxygen is the most abundant element in the cosmos not produced in the Big\nBang, and the third most common overall. Oxygen and its isotopes are key\ntracers of the formation and evolution of planets, stars and galaxies and as such\nit is one of the most important elements in all of astronomy. Nevertheless, or\nperhaps consequentially, its abundance often seems to be in dispute with the\nsolar O abundance being no exception. The favoured solar content has dropped\nalmost precipitously over the past two decades from log \u01ebO = 8.93 \u00b1 0.04 in\nAnders & Grevesse (1989) to 8.66 in Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005). The\nvalue we recommend here, log \u01ebO = 8.69 \u00b1 0.05, is taken from Asplund et al.\n(2009c), who presented a 3D-based study of the available diagnostics: forbidden\n[O i] and permitted O i transitions as well as vibration-rotation and pure rotation\nlines of OH.\nAllende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund (2001) reanalysed the [O i] 630 nm line\nwith a 3D model atmosphere. Based on the line profile they demonstrated that\nthe line is blended by a Ni i line, which was subsequently confirmed experimentally (Johansson et al. 2003). In combination with the 3D model, recognition of\nthe blend led to a substantial lowering of the solar O abundance compared with\nthe canonical value at the time. Ayres (2008) revisited the 630 nm line with a\nsingle snapshot of another 3D model but found a 0.12 dex higher O abundance,\npartly because he allowed the Ni i gf -value to vary freely in spite of the new accurate measurement by Johansson et al. (2003). Caffau et al. (2008a) used several\nsnapshots from the same co5bold 3D model but instead fixed the Ni contribution assuming the Ni abundance from Grevesse & Sauval (1998) thereby confirming the results of Allende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund (2001) and Asplund et al.\n(2004). A more self-consistent approach is to first determine the Ni abundance\nbefore considering the [O i] line, as done by Scott et al. (2009a) with the same\n3D model as employed by Asplund et al. (2004). As explained by Scott et al.,\nit is then possible to very accurately predict the Ni i contribution to the overall\nline strength, independent of the reference atmospheric model. Asplund et al.\n(2009c) updated this analysis and found that the effects of the increased Ni i\nproportion and their shallower model temperature gradient in comparison with\nAllende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund (2001) compensate for one another, leaving\nthe abundance at log \u01ebO = 8.66. This abundance is also consistent with the centerto-limb variation of the 630 nm feature (Pereira, Asplund & Kiselman 2009).\nIn addition to the 630 nm line, there are two other [O i] transitions that can\nbe utilized. The 636 nm line is located in the midst of a very broad Ca i autoionization line as well as blended by CN lines; the latter's contribution can however be accurately predicted from other neighboring CN lines. Both Caffau et al.\n(2008a) and Asplund et al. (2009c) found that this line returns a slightly higher\nabundance than the 630 nm line, but still consistent within the uncertainties.\nMel\u00e9ndez & Asplund (2008) added the [O i] 557 nm line, whose slightly excited\nlower level makes it largely independent of the model atmosphere. Unfortunately\nthis transition is badly blended by C2 lines, whose contribution Mel\u00e9ndez & Asplund\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n13\n\nattempted to estimate using nearby C2 lines with the same line strengths and\nexcitation potential. Asplund et al. (2009c) obtained an abundance from the\n557 nm line exactly in between those from the other two forbidden transitions.\nThe three [O i] lines imply a solar O abundance of log \u01ebO = 8.70 \u00b1 0.05 when due\nconsideration is given to the blends.\nRecently, Centeno & Socas-Navarro (2008) introduced a novel method to estimate the O abundance, namely spectropolarimetry of the [O i] 630 nm line in\na sunspot. Because of the different polarization of the [O i] and Ni i lines it is\npossible to disentangle the Ni i contribution. After consideration of the fraction\nof O tied up in CO in the cool environments of sunspots, they obtained a high O\nabundance of log \u01ebO = 8.86. Scott et al. (2009a) have however pointed out that\nCenteno & Socas-Navarro applied an outdated gf -value for the [O i] line. Furthermore, they showed that when using an improved Ni abundance and an alternative CO treatment one finds a significantly lower O abundance: log \u01ebO = 8.71;\na further reduction is obtained when employing an alternative sunspot model.\nThere are a half-dozen or so permitted, high-excitation O i lines useful for solar abundance purposes. Of these the relatively strong 777 nm triplet lines are\narguably the most reliable since the others are either weak or partly blended.\nThe main challenge when employing the O i lines relates to quantifying the nonLTE effects, which can be significant. The predicted non-LTE abundance corrections are little dependent on the model atmosphere in question, be it 1D or\n3D (Asplund et al. 2004) but they do depend on the adopted collisional crosssections, in particular the inelastic H collisions (e.g. Asplund 2005, Kiselman\n1993). Different approaches have been used in solar abundance works to date\nwhere some neglect the H collisions altogether based on the available atomic\nphysics data for other elements while other use the classical Drawin (1968) formula, possibly with a scaling factor SH that typically varies from 0 to 1. Holweger\n(2001) found log \u01ebO = 8.71\u00b10.05 using the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model with\ngranulation corrections estimated from a 2D solar model, while Asplund et al.\n(2004) obtained a 0.07 dex lower abundance from a 3D non-LTE study; the main\ndifference, however, between the two studies is the adopted H collisions (SH = 1\nand 0, respectively). Allende Prieto, Asplund & Fabiani Bendicho (2004) attempted to calibrate the poorly known collisional efficiency through a comparison\nof the center-to-limb variation of the O i 777 nm line strengths since the relative importance of H collisions change as NH /Ne increases with smaller optical\ndepths. They found that SH = 1 was a marginally better fit than SH = 0\nwhile the LTE case could be ruled out at high significance level. Recently,\nPereira, Asplund & Kiselman (2009) have revisited the issue equipped with better solar observations and tested additional SH values but have arrived at a similar\nconclusion, as can be seen in Fig. 5.\nThe O i-based abundance we adopt here stems from Asplund et al. (2009c),\nwhich is based on full 3D non-LTE calculations with SH = 1. The new electron\ncollisional cross-sections computed by Barklem (2007a) have also been adopted\n(see Fabbian et al. 2009 for an account of the impact of these on other stars).\nThe revised abundance is slightly higher than in Asplund et al. (2004): log \u01ebO =\n8.69 \u00b1 0.05. Using a different 3D model, Caffau et al. (2008a) obtained log \u01ebO =\n8.73 \u00b1 0.06 (unweighted mean) for their disk-center O i lines, in spite of using\nSH = 1/3; with SH = 1 their result would be 0.02 dex higher. Because they\nwere restricted to 1D non-LTE calculations, they were unable to carry out line\nprofile fitting as done by Asplund et al. (2009c). They were therefore forced\n\n\f14\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nto rely on measuring equivalent widths, which were surprisingly large compared\nto all previous published studies. Reassuringly, when the same input data are\nadopted (e.g. line strengths, H collisional efficiency), the Caffau et al. (2008a)\nand Asplund et al. (2009c) analyses are in excellent agreement, which shows that\nthe exact choice of 3D model is of little consequence for the permitted O i lines.\nGrevesse, Sauval & van Dishoeck (1984) and Sauval et al. (1984) introduced\nthe vibration-rotation and pure rotation lines of OH as solar O abundance indicators. In their 3D-based analysis, Asplund et al. (2004) found that the OH lines\nimplied an O abundance only slightly lower than the atomic transitions. While\nthe vibration lines showed no trends with excitation potential or line strength,\nthe pure rotation lines did. This is not too surprising, since these strong rotation\nlines are formed in very high atmospheric layers, which are the most challenging\nto model realistically due to for example magnetic fields, non-LTE and nonequilibrium chemistry. Asplund et al. (2009c) revisited the OH lines equipped\nwith a new 3D model, which yielded log \u01ebO = 8.69 and 8.69 for the vibrationrotation and pure rotation lines, respectively; the trend with line strength for the\nlatter were still present but somewhat reduced and now in the opposite direction.\nUnfortunately, the OH lines have not yet been analysed using the alternative\n3D model of Caffau et al. (2008a). Mel\u00e9ndez (2004) added a few vibration lines\nfrom the first overtone band of OH, which we however do not consider sufficiently\nreliable abundance indicators due to their extreme weakness.\nThe 3D-based solar O abundance that we recommend here, log \u01ebO = 8.69 \u00b1\n0.05, is a mean of the [O i], O i, OH vibration-rotation and OH pure rotation\nresults of Asplund et al. (2009c). The agreement between the different abundance\nindicators is very satisfactory, which is not the case with the Holweger & M\u00fcller\n(1974) model as seen in Table 2. As explained above, the use of a 3D model is only\none factor in the downward revision of the O abundance from the value 8.83 \u00b1\n0.06 given in Grevesse & Sauval (1998) with refined non-LTE line formation,\nbetter accounting of blends and improved atomic and molecular data also playing\nimportant roles.\nUsing CO lines, Scott et al. (2006) determined an isotopic abundance of\n16 O/18 O = 479 \u00b1 29. The significantly lower, non-terrestrial ratio obtained by\nAyres, Plymate & Keller (2006) is likely the result of their use of 1D model atmospheres. Several lines due to 12 C17 O are present in the solar infrared spectrum\nbut due to their extreme weakness we do not believe a trustworthy 16 O/17 O ratio\ncan be inferred from them at this stage.\n\n3.5\n\nIntermediate Mass Elements\n\nSodium: Asplund et al. (2009b) based their 3D solar Na abundance determination on five weak Na i lines, which all yielded consistent results (\u03c3 = 0.03 dex).\nThe predicted departures from LTE in 1D are slightly negative (\u2248 \u22120.04 dex) and\nagree well between different studies (Allende Prieto, Asplund & Fabiani Bendicho\n2004, Shi, Gehren & Zhao 2004, Takeda et al. 2003). The Na abundance we\nadopt here is slightly larger than the preliminary value presented in Asplund, Grevesse & Sau\n(2005).\nMagnesium: The abundance of Mg can be inferred from two ionization stages,\neach with a multitude of seemingly clean, relatively weak lines (Lambert & Luck\n1978). Unfortunately, the gf -values for Mg i and Mg ii are notoriously uncertain, as reflected in fairly large line-to-line abundance variations for both species.\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n15\n\nDepartures from LTE in 1D line formation by Mg i have been considered by\nZhao, Butler & Gehren (1998) and T. Gehren (2008, private communication); the\nabundance corrections are small and positive. Abia & Mashonkina (2004) and\nL. Mashonkina (2008, private communication) have made corresponding calculations for Mg ii. With the predicted non-LTE effects, the mean Mg ii abundance\nis brought into better agreement with the meteoritic abundance while Mg i is\nfurther offset. Since we do not have greater confidence in either set of transition\nprobabilities and non-LTE calculations are available for both species, we simply\ntake a straight mean of all lines (Asplund et al. 2009b). The attached uncertainty\nis disappointingly large for such an important element.\nAluminium: Our recommended Al abundance comes from Asplund et al.\n(2009b), who performed an analysis of seven good, weak Al i lines with relatively\nwell-determined gf -values. The departures from LTE are predicted to be small.\nWe have adopted the non-LTE results from 1D calculations by Gehren et al.\n(2004), with the expectation that they will not be very different in 3D.\nSilicon: Silicon is a critical element since it provides the absolute normalization for the meteoritic abundances (Sect. 4.1). Asplund (2000) carried out an\nearly 3D-based LTE analysis of Si i and Si ii lines and found log \u01ebSi = 7.51 \u00b1 0.04.\nWith an improved 3D solar model and non-LTE corrections (\u2248 \u22120.02 dex) taken\nfrom Shi et al. (2008), Asplund et al. (2009b) found the same value in their reanalysis, which we adopt here. Had we instead opted to use the Holweger & M\u00fcller\n(1974) 1D semi-empirical model the result would have been a mere 0.02 dex\nhigher.\nPhosphorus: Caffau et al. (2007b) carried out a solar P determination using\na co5bold 3D solar model and found log \u01ebP = 5.46 (\u03c3 = 0.04) from four P i lines.\nA slightly lower 3D-based value was obtained by Asplund et al. (2009b), who also\nincluded one more line: log \u01ebP = 5.41 \u00b1 0.03 (\u03c3 = 0.03). We adopt this latter\nvalue on account of its smaller line-to-line scatter. No non-LTE investigation has\nbeen performed to date for these high-excitation P i lines. Departures from LTE\nare not expected to be significant however, a prediction supported by the small\nnon-LTE effects for the similar S i lines (Takeda et al. 2005).\nSulphur: In their 3D-based analysis, Caffau et al. (2007a) obtained a disturbingly large line-to-line scatter: log \u01ebS = 7.21 \u00b1 0.11 (\u03c3); this result includes\nthe non-LTE corrections of Takeda et al. (2005). Very recently, the issue of the\nsolar S abundance was revisited by Asplund et al. (2009b), who included a few\nadditional lines. Their non-LTE abundance is slightly smaller and, importantly,\nshows a much reduced uncertainty: log \u01ebS = 7.12 \u00b1 0.03 (\u03c3 = 0.03). The differences between Asplund et al. (2009b) and Caffau et al. (2007a) can be partly\ntraced to the adopted equivalent widths, but this cannot be the whole explanation. Interestingly, Asplund et al. (2009b) concluded that the forbidden [S i]\n1082 nm line returns too high an abundance by 0.3 dex, which may signal an\nunidentified blend, non-LTE effects or that the theoretical transition probability\nis in error. Caffau & Ludwig (2007) on the other hand found excellent agreement with the meteoritic value for this line. They adopted however an outdated\ngf -value and a much smaller equivalent width, which we are unable to reconcile\nwith the observed solar spectrum.\nPotassium: Asplund et al. (2009b) based their 3D analysis on six K i lines,\nincluding the strong resonance line at 769.9 nm. As in previous studies, the lineto-line scatter is disappointingly large for these lines, even when taking into account the theoretical non-LTE effects computed by Zhang et al. (2006). In terms\n\n\f16\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nof abundances, the non-LTE corrections are substantial for the two strongest lines\n(\u2265 \u22120.2 dex).\nCalcium: The solar Ca abundance can be determined from both Ca i and Ca ii\n(Lambert & Luck 1978), although there are problems with both species: most of\nthe Ca i lines are rather strong, whilst the uncertainties in the transition probabilities for the Ca ii lines are still unsatisfactory large (Opacity Project data assuming LS-coupling). Asplund et al. (2009b) found good agreement between the\ntwo ionization stages and obtained a final Ca abundance of log \u01ebCa = 6.34 \u00b1 0.04\n(\u03c3 = 0.04) from all Ca i and Ca ii lines, including 1D non-LTE abundance corrections computed by Mashonkina, Korn & Przybilla (2007). We note that the\nforbidden [Ca ii] line at 732.3 nm implies an abundance which is fully consistent\nwith the other transitions.\n\n3.6\n\nIron-peak Elements\n\nScandium: With its relatively low ionization potential, Sc is prone to overionization via non-LTE effects (Zhang, Gehren & Zhao 2008). The impact on\nabundances from Sc i lines is dramatic (+0.15 dex relative to LTE on average\nfor the lines considered by Scott et al. 2009b), but predictably mild for Sc ii\n(\u22120.01 dex). Good lines, oscillator strengths and hyperfine constants are available\nfor both ionization stages. With five weak lines of Sc i, twelve of Sc ii and the\nnon-LTE corrections of Zhang, Gehren & Zhao (2008), Scott et al. (2009b) have\nproduced 3D-based abundances showing very good agreement between the two\nionization stages. In Table 1 we give the mean of the abundances from all lines of\nboth species, where Sc ii ultimately dominates because of the greater number of\nlines. The +0.10 dex difference between the new Sc abundance and the meteoritic\none is intriguing.\nTitanium: Very many good lines of Ti i are present in the Sun, virtually\nall with excellent atomic data. Whilst fewer lines of Ti ii are available and the\natomic data are not quite as good as for Ti i, the situation is still relatively\nacceptable. The one glaring absence is a study of non-LTE effects for this element.\nAs is the case for its neighbours Sc and V, the low ionization potential of Ti\nand the resulting minority status of Ti i are expected to significantly skew the\nabundances it returns under the assumption of LTE. Using the improved 3D\nmodel atmosphere, Scott et al. (2009b) found stark disagreement between LTE\nabundances from Ti i and Ti ii (Ti i: log \u01ebTi = 4.85 \u00b1 0.06, Ti ii: log \u01ebTi = 4.99 \u00b1\n0.04), though with very low scatter from each species individually (\u03c3 = 0.03 for\nboth stages). In the absence of any non-LTE study, we favour Ti ii in Table 1 by\ntaking the mean of the two results weighted according to their total uncertainties;\nwe only retain any weighting for the Ti i result because of the sheer number of\nexcellent lines and oscillator strengths it includes.\nVanadium: Neutral vanadium has scores of excellent lines in the visible solar\nspectrum, whilst very few are available from V ii, all extremely perturbed. On the\nother hand, V i is expected to show similarly strong non-LTE effects as verified\nfor Sc i and suspected for Ti i, owing to the elements' similar potential for overionization. The impact of non-LTE line formation on V has not yet been the\nsubject of a dedicated study. Scott et al. (2009b) obtain a 3D LTE abundance\nof log \u01ebV = 3.83 from V i lines. Scott et al.'s analysis of V ii lines yields an\nabundance quite consistent with this corrected value, but the poor quality of the\nlines employed makes the result inconclusive. In the absence of any good results\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n17\n\nfor V ii, we adopt the V i value but adjust it by the mean non-LTE effect seen in\nSc i and Cr i (+0.10 dex).\nChromium: The solar spectrum exhibits a large number of clean, weak lines\nof both neutral and once-ionised chromium. Unfortunately, no reliable oscillator strengths are available for Cr ii. Neither is any estimate of the impact of\nnon-LTE effects on Cr available; given its relatively low ionization potential, Cr\nshould consist mostly of Cr ii in the Sun, possibly leading to non-LTE effects for\nCr i. Recent non-LTE calculations by M. Bergemann (private communication)\nconfirm departures from LTE at the level of +0.04 dex. Using their own measured\noscillator strengths for Cr i, Sobeck, Lawler & Sneden (2007) recently revised the\nsolar chromium abundance. This result was updated by Scott et al. (2009b) using a 3D model. Given the much greater number of Cr i lines in the sample, and\nthe poor quality of the Cr ii oscillator strengths, we allow Cr i to dominate the\nvalue in Table 1 by taking the mean of abundances from all Cr i and Cr ii lines\ntogether. The only reason we allow abundances from Cr ii lines to enter into the\nmean is our suspicion of an as yet unquantified non-LTE effect for Cr i.\nManganese: Following years of confusion now traceable mostly to poor oscillator strengths, the solar manganese abundance was recently rederived by\nBlackwell-Whitehead & Bergemann (2007), using their own improved Mn i gf values, extensive hyperfine splitting data and the non-LTE calculations of Bergemann & Gehren\n(2007). This result was updated by Scott et al. (2009b) using a 3D solar model,\nbringing the photospheric Mn abundance even closer to the meteoritic value. Mn i\nshows moderate non-LTE effects (about +0.06 dex), consistent with its ionization\npotential being intermediate between the lower values seen in the lighter members of the iron group Sc, Ti, V and Cr and the higher values exhibited by the\nheavier elements Fe, Co and Ni.\nIron: In many circumstances iron serves as a proxy for the overall metal\ncontent and as a reference against which other elemental abundances are measured. An intense debate long raged as to whether the solar Fe abundance inferred from Fe i lines should be log \u01ebFe \u2248 7.7 (e.g. Blackwell, Lynas-Gray & Smith\n1995) or log \u01ebFe \u2248 7.5 (e.g. Holweger, Kock & Bard 1995), with the choice of\nequivalent widths, gf -values, microturbulence parameters and pressure-damping\nconstants all playing a role. The advent of improved transition probabilities\nfor Fe ii lines (e.g. Hannaford et al. 1992, Schnabel, Kock & Holweger 1999) and\na proper treatment of pressure broadening (e.g. Anstee, O'Mara & Ross 1997,\nBarklem, Piskunov & O'Mara 2000a) strengthened the case for a low Fe abundance. An unsatisfactory combination of large abundance scatter, the presence of\na free parameter (microturbulence), and a trend with excitation potential still remained with the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model, however (Grevesse & Sauval\n1999). Using a 3D hydrodynamical solar model and LTE line profile fitting,\nAsplund et al. (2000c) succeeded in achieving consistent results for Fe i and Fe ii\nlines without invoking any microturbulence: log \u01ebFe = 7.45 \u00b1 0.05.\nThe solar Fe abundance we advocate here comes from Scott et al. (2009b).\nThe Fe i-based abundance of log \u01ebFe \u2248 7.52 \u00b1 0.05 from weak lines is slightly\nhigher than in Asplund et al. (2000c) on account of a slightly shallower mean\ntemperature structure in the new 3D model and allowance of departures from\nLTE. The non-LTE abundance corrections have been estimated to be +0.03 dex\nfor Fe i (Collet, Asplund & Th\u00e9venin 2005; Korn, Shi & Gehren 2003), although\nthis depends on the still poorly-known inelastic H collisions (see Asplund 2005,\nand references therein). In fact, a more reliable abundance now comes from\n\n\f18\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nFe ii lines, thanks to the improved transition probabilities of Mel\u00e9ndez & Barbuy\n(2009) and the broadening treatment of Barklem & Aspelund-Johansson (2005).\nTogether these imply log \u01ebFe \u2248 7.50 \u00b1 0.04(\u03c3 = 0.04) with the same 3D model.\nWe note that with the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model, there is a trend in Fe i\nabundances with excitation potential and a discrepancy of 0.14 dex between Fe i\nand Fe ii. Both have disappeared with the 3D solar model (Fig. 6). Reassuringly,\nthe situation regarding Fe has greatly improved over the past decade.\nCobalt: The fairly high ionization potential of Co and the availability of\nmany good Co i lines, gf -values and hyperfine constants should make its solar\nanalysis quite straightforward. Scott et al. (2009b) found a 3D LTE abundance\nof log \u01ebCo = 4.88, in agreement with the meteoritic value. Taking into account\nthe surprisingly large non-LTE corrections of Bergemann (2008) changes the final\nabundance to log \u01ebCo = 4.99 \u00b1 0.07 (\u03c3 = 0.05).\nNickel: The solar Ni abundance was estimated by Scott et al. (2009a) from 17\nweak Ni i lines, showing a very small abundance scatter. The value given in Table\n1 is a slight revision of this result (Scott et al. 2009b) based on the improved 3D\nmodel atmosphere that has been employed throughout this review.\n\n3.7\n\nNeutron Capture Elements\n\nQuite some work on the solar abundances of the heavy elements has been carried out over the past decade, largely driven by improvements in atomic transition probabilities. In this context, we would like to particularly highlight the\nvery careful laboratory measurements performed by the Wisconsin group (e.g.\nLawler et al. 2009). In a beautiful series of papers, they have systematically\nand methodically measured radiative lifetimes, branching fractions, oscillator\nstrengths, isotopic shifts and hyperfine constants for all the rare Earth elements:\nLa (Lawler, Bonvallet & Sneden 2001), Ce (Lawler et al. 2009), Pr (Sneden et al.\n2009), Nd (Den Hartog et al. 2003), Sm (Lawler et al. 2006), Eu (Lawler et al.\n2001b), Gd (Den Hartog et al. 2006), Tb (Lawler et al. 2001a), Dy (Sneden et al.\n2009), Ho (Lawler, Sneden & Cowan 2004), Er (Lawler et al. 2008), Tm, Yb and\nLu (Sneden et al. 2009); the group has also carried out a similar study for Hf\n(Lawler et al. 2007). In their solar abundance analyses, they have employed\nthe 1D Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model atmosphere and assumed LTE for the\nspectrum synthesis. Although all the utilized transitions are from the majority\nionization stage (once ionized) for the rare Earths, one still expects a minor temperature and thus model-atmosphere dependence, since the lines originate from\natomic levels with low excitation potentials (\u03c7exc \u2264 1.5 eV). The recommended\nsolar abundances provided in Table 1 for these elements have been modified\nfrom the original sources by calculating the abundance difference between a 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmosphere and the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model,\neach computed using the same line formation code with consistent input data\n(Grevesse et al. 2009). For the majority of these lines, such (3D-HM) abundance\ncorrections amount to \u2248 \u22120.04 dex. In addition, the 1D non-LTE effects on Eu ii\npredicted by Mashonkina & Gehren (2000) have been taken into account in the\n3D result; non-LTE studies are not available for any other rare Earth elements.\nA similar procedure has been implemented for Cd (Youssef, Doenszelmann & Grevesse\n1990), W (Holweger & Werner 1982), Os (Quinet et al. 2006), Ir (Youssef & Khalil\n1988) and Au (Youssef 1986), all of which have only heavily blended transitions\navailable in the solar spectrum, necessitating careful and time-consuming spec-\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n19\n\ntrum syntheses. Due to blends, we consider the two As i lines employed by\nGopka et al. (2001) too unreliable to base a meaningful abundance determination on and consequently do not provide a solar photospheric As abundance\nhere. Similarly, we are unable to defend an estimate of the Sb abundance from\nthe very weak and heavily perturbed, purported Sb i line at 323.2 nm reported\nby Ross & Aller (1976).\nFor all other neutron capture elements, the adopted abundances come from\na complete 3D-based reanalysis using the best atomic data and newly measured\nequivalent widths or spectrum synthesis for the most reliable lines. Grevesse et al.\n(2009) present the solar analyses of Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru,\nRh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Ba, Pb and Th, which we adopt throughout; the case of\nRu is also discussed in Fivet et al. (2009). The available 1D non-LTE abundance\ncorrections for Zn i (Takeda et al. 2005), Sr ii (Mashonkina & Gehren 2001) and\nBa ii (Mashonkina & Gehren 2000) have been included in these estimates. For\ncomparison purposes we have also repeated the line calculations with an assortment of 1D model atmospheres. We have found very good agreement (< 0.02 dex)\nwith recent studies using the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974) model when allowance\nis made for differences in adopted transition probabilities and equivalent widths\nfor Ge (Bi\u00e9mont et al. 1999), Sr (Barklem & O'Mara 2000), Pd (Xu et al. 2006)\nand Pb (Bi\u00e9mont et al. 2000).\nA handful of elements have previously been exposed to a 3D-based solar abundance analysis. Ljung et al. (2006) made use of new transition probabilities for\nZr ii and employed the 3D solar model of Asplund et al. (2000b). Not surprisingly, the agreement with Grevesse et al. (2009) is very good. Eu has been the\nfocus of Mucciarelli et al. (2008), who employed a 3D co5bold hydrodynamical\nmodel and found a mean Eu abundance in perfect agreement with ours. The 3D\nLTE abundance for Hf from Caffau et al. (2008b) is only 0.02 dex higher than\nthe corresponding value by Grevesse et al. (2009), who corrected the spectrum\nsynthesis results of Lawler et al. (2007) for 3D effects rather than attempting to\nmeasure the equivalent widths of these weak and blended Hf ii lines. Caffau et al.\n(2008b) also performed a detailed investigation using 3D line profile fitting of the\nTh ii 401.9 nm line, which is distorted by two Co i and V i lines (not V ii as stated\nin their paper), as well as being in the red wing of a relatively strong feature\nfrom Fe i and Ni i. Interestingly, they argued that it is important to take into\naccount the line asymmetry of the Fe i+Ni i blend introduced by the convective\nmotions (e.g. Asplund et al. 2000b), which otherwise would lead to an overestimation of the Th abundance by \u2248 0.1 dex. Unfortunately Caffau et al. (2008b)\ndid not specify what abundances they used for the blending lines, so it is difficult\nto exactly reproduce their result; the value obtained by Grevesse et al. (2009) is\nconsistent with that of Caffau et al., though smaller by 0.06 dex.\n\n3.8\n\nAbundances from Sunspots: F, Cl, In, Tl\n\nThe photospheric abundances of a few elements are not possible to measure using spectroscopy of the quiet Sun. The solar fluorine and chlorine abundances\nhave instead been inferred from the infrared spectrum of sunspots using lines\nof HF (Hall & Noyes 1969) and HCl (Hall & Noyes 1972). Given the improvements in molecular data, observational quality and sunspot modelling in the\nintervening years since the original workds, it seems like a critical re-evaluation\nof these studies is warranted but not attempted here. The same holds for Tl\n\n\f20\n\nAsplund et al.\n\n(Lambert, Mallia & Smith 1972). We note that in the meantime a more reliable\nestimate of the solar Cl may be provided by the abundance of nearby H ii regions, which is log \u01ebCl = 5.32 \u00b1 0.07 (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Rojas & Esteban 2007). Recently,\nVitas et al. (2008) have revisited the solar In abundance. In contrast to previous\nstudies based on the quiet Sun, they find an abundance from a sunspot spectrum\nin agreement with the meteoritic value.\n\n3.9\n\nIndirect Determinations: Noble Gases\n\nDue to their high excitation potentials, there are no photospheric lines of the noble\ngases helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon available in the solar spectrum,\nwhich forces one to estimate the solar abundances of these elements through\nindirect methods.\nHelium: A highly accurate He abundance determination is possible through\nhelioseismology. The technique utilizes the change in the adiabatic index \u03931 in the\nHe ii ionization zone that takes place at a solar radius of r/R\u2299 \u2248 0.98. The result\nis quite insensitive to the reference solar model employed for the inversion, but\ndoes depend on the adopted equation-of-state. Basu & Antia (2004) found a He\nmass fraction in the convection zone of Ys = 0.2485 \u00b1 0.0034, which corresponds\nto a He abundance by number of log \u01ebHe = 10.93 \u00b1 0.01. The uncertainty essentially reflects the difference between the MHD (Mihalas, D\u00e4ppen & Hummer\n1988) and OPAL (Rogers & Nayfonov 2002) equation-of-state, but there is also\na minor dependence on the assumed metallicity of the reference solar model for\nthe inversion (Trampedach, D\u00e4ppen & Baturin 2006). A similar value is obtained\nwhen calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct mass, luminosity and\nradius at the present solar age, if the chemical composition of Grevesse & Sauval\n(1998) is adopted and diffusion is considered. With the solar abundances of\nAsplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005) on the other hand, the calibrated proto-solar\nHe abundance would imply a surface value lower than the helioseismic measurement by 0.02 dex. Such models are also in conflict with other helioseismological\nevidence such as the depth of the convection zone and the sound speed variation\nwith depth, as discussed in Sect. 4.3.\nNeon: The Ne abundance can be inferred from X-ray and UV spectroscopy of\nthe solar corona and solar flares as well as directly from the solar wind. The interpretation is, however, complicated by the so-called first ionization potential (FIP)\neffect: elements with ionization potential \u03c7ion < 10 eV are enhanced in the upper\nsolar atmosphere and solar wind compared with their photospheric values, whilst\nthe high ionization elements are not or only slightly affected (Feldman & Widing\n2003). Rather than measuring the Ne abundance directly, a common approach\nis to determine the abundance relative to a reference element and assume that\nthe ratio is the same in the photosphere. Here O is the reference element of\nchoice, although we note that there is still a significant difference in ionization\npotential between O (13.6 eV) and Ne (21.6 eV), which could potentially introduce a systematic error given our poor understanding of the physical reasons for\nthe FIP effect. The degree of chemical separation varies significantly, being more\nsevere in regions of higher solar activity. Young (2005b) found a Ne/O ratio\nof 0.175 \u00b1 0.031 for the quiet Sun, which is the value we adopt here to convert\nour photospheric O abundance to a Ne content. This result is particularly appealing for our purposes since Young (2005a) has demonstrated that the average\nquiet Sun does not show any FIP effect, a conclusion which is further corrob-\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n21\n\norated when using the solar abundances given herein. This ratio is consistent\nwith the results of Schmelz et al. (2005) for active regions (0.175 \u00b1 0.074) and\nfor the solar wind (0.14 \u00b1 0.03) by Bochsler (2007). The corresponding ratio in\nsolar energetic particles is very similar and remarkably constant: 0.152 \u00b1 0.006\n(Reames 1999), which was adopted by Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005). In\nspite of its very small uncertainty, here we weight this result less than from the\nquiet Sun due to the potential modification through the FIP effect. Together\nwith our recommended O abundance, the photospheric Ne abundance becomes\nlog \u01ebNe = 7.93 \u00b1 0.09.\nOur value is smaller than the solar flare determination (log \u01ebNe = 8.11\u00b10.12) by\nLandi, Feldman & Doschek (2007), but we consider the quiet Sun a more reliable\nindicator than solar flares due to possible fractionation processes in the latter.\nWhile the Ne abundance (log \u01ebNe = 7.96 \u00b1 0.13) of Bochsler (2007) agrees with\nours, there are significant additional uncertainties in this result on account of\nusing He as a reference element, as it is known to be highly variable in the solar\nwind.\nDrake & Testa (2005) have argued on the basis of X-ray spectroscopy of nearby\nstars that the Ne/O ratio is significantly higher (0.41) than the solar ratios discussed above. Their sample is, however, heavily biased towards active stars,\nwhich experience an inverse FIP effect: elements with \u03c7ion > 10 eV are enhanced\nin the corona compared with low ionization potential species (G\u00fcdel 2004). Indeed, Robrade, Schmitt & Favata (2008) show that there is a systematic trend\nin Ne/O with activity level such that other inactive stars have similar low ratios\nto the Sun. One would therefore suspect that the high coronal Ne/O ratio inferred by Drake & Testa (2005) is a consequence of the difference in ionization\npotential, making Ne more susceptible to fractionation than O in high activity\nenvironments. As will be further discussed in Sect. 4.2, a more reliable stellar\ngauge of the solar Ne abundance is provided by OB stars in the solar neighborhood. Both the Ne/O ratio (0.20 \u00b1 0.03) and the absolute Ne abundance\n(log \u01ebNe = 8.08 \u00b1 0.03) estimated in this way are in very good agreement with the\nsolar values we adopt here when the effects of solar diffusion and Galactic chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr are accounted for (Przybilla, Nieva & Butler\n2008).\nArgon: As discussed in detail by Lodders (2008), there are a wide range of\nmethods for inferring the solar Ar abundance: solar wind measurements, solar\nflares and energetic particles, nuclear statistical equilibrium with the abundances\nof the nearby \u03b1-elements 28 S and 40 Ca, and comparison with other solar system\nobjects (Jupiter) and the solar neighborhood (B stars, planetary nebulae, H ii\nregions). We follow the procedure of Lodders (2008) but employ our preferred\nvalues for the photospheric abundances of O (for the solar wind, flares and energetic particles), Kr and Xe (for analyses of Jupiter), and the lower He abundance\nappropriate for the upper atmosphere instead of the photospheric value (for solar\nwind analyses). The quoted errors for all methods in the literature are only the\ndispersions of the measurements, so likely underestimate of the true uncertainties. We therefore take a straight unweighted mean of all techniques, which leads\nto log \u01ebAr = 6.40 \u00b1 0.13. Our value is 0.1 dex lower than the result of Lodders\n(2008) but 0.2 dex higher than Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005), which was\nbased only on the Ar/O ratio in solar energetic particles (Reames 1999).\nKrypton: The Kr abundance has been estimated from interpolation of the theoretical s-process production rates, since the cross-sections for neutron capture\n\n\f22\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nof nearby pure s-isotopes have been accurately measured experimentally (Palme\n& Beer 1993). Our value accounts for a slight revision of the photospheric Si\nabundance, which serves as a normalization of the s-process predictions. This Kr\nestimate agrees well with the value inferred from the solar wind Kr/O ratio together with our photospheric O abundance (Geiss, Gloeckler & von Steiger 1994;\nHeber et al. 2008b).\nXenon: The procedure to estimate the Xe content is the same as for Kr\n(K\u00e4ppeler 2005). For Xe, however, this s-process estimated value is 0.4 dex lower\nthan deduced from the solar wind as measured from lunar regoliths (Geiss, Gloeckler & von S\n1994) and the Genesis space probe (Heber et al. 2008b). This may suggest that\nXe has experienced fractionation through the FIP effect in spite of its relatively\nhigh ionization energy (\u03c7ion = 12.1 eV).\n\n3.10\n\nSolar Isotopic Abundances\n\nAs a convenience to the reader, in Table 3 we give our best estimates of the protosolar isotopic fractions for each element. In most cases the terrestrial isotopic\nabundance ratios as recommended by International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (Rosman & Taylor 1998) have been adopted as representative of the\nsolar system values; direct solar isotopic information can only be gleaned from\nCO vibration-rotation lines in the infrared spectrum of the Sun (e.g. Scott et al.\n2006), although with comparatively large error bars by terrestrial standards. It\nshould be noted that except for C and O, the isotopic fractions given here are the\nmore conservative \"representative isotopic composition\" from the compilation of\nRosman & Taylor (1998), in contrast to Lodders (2003) who opted for the \"best\nmeasurement from a single terrestrial source\" from the same reference. For most\nvolatile elements more reliable isotopic fractions are available from alternative\nsolar system sources due to strong depletion of terrestrial samples, as discussed\nbelow.\nThe proto-solar deuterium abundance can be estimated from observations of\nJupiter. Using ISO spectra of the Jovian atmosphere and taking into account an\nexpected 5\u221210% enrichment during the planet's formation, Lellouch et al. (2001)\nobtained a proto-solar abundance of D/H = (2.1 \u00b1 0.4) * 10\u22125 . An alternative\napproach makes use of the measured enrichment of the 3 He/4 He ratio in the\nsolar wind in comparison with the proto-solar ratio 3 He/4 He = (1.66 \u00b1 0.05) *\n10\u22124 inferred from Jupiter (Mahaffy et al. 1998), since the additional 3 He can\nbe attributed to D-burning in the Sun (Gloeckler & Geiss 2000). Together with\nthe solar wind ratio 3 He/4 He = (4.53 \u00b1 0.03) * 10\u22124 from Genesis measurements\n(Heber et al. 2008a), the Jovian ratio implies D/H = (1.96 \u00b1 0.3) * 10\u22125 ; most\nof the uncertainty comes from the poorly-known He fractionation in the solar\nwind. From the two methods, we finally estimate a proto-solar abundance of\nD/H = (2.0 \u00b1 0.2) * 10\u22125 . This is consistent with the present-day local interstellar\nmedium abundance (Linsky et al. 2006), which implies only a small degree of\nastration over the past 4.5 Gyr.\nThe 12 C/13 C ratio does not appear to vary significantly between different solar\nsystem sources, so we simply adopt the accurate terrestrial reference value of Vienna Peeddee belemnite: 12 C/13 C = 89.4\u00b10.2 (Coplen et al. 2002). We note that\nthe \"representative isotopic composition\" from Rosman & Taylor (1998) corresponds to the significantly more uncertain value 12 C/13 C = 92 \u00b1 7. The ratio\ninferred from the solar photosphere using CO lines (86.8 \u00b1 3.8) is consistent with\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n23\n\nthe terrestrial value (Scott et al. 2006).\nThe 14 N/15 N ratio varies tremendously between various solar system objects,\nfrom 100 to 450 (Owen et al. 2001). Here we adopt the Jovian value 435 \u00b1 57 as\nrepresentative of the proto-solar ratio, in agreement with values in the interstellar\nmedium and carbonaceous chondrites (Meibom et al. 2007).\nOxygen isotopic abundances display a variability of up to a few percent within\nthe solar system. The best values to adopt for the proto-solar oxygen isotopic ratios are still debated (e.g. Hashizume & Chaussidon 2005, Ireland et al.\n2006). The first results from the Genesis mission should appear very soon\n(McKeegan et al. 2008), which will hopefully shed some light on the issue. Until\nsuch further clarification, we adopt the terrestrial values represented in Vienna\nStandard Mean Ocean Water: 16 O/18 O = 498.7 \u00b1 0.1 and 16 O/17 O = 2632 \u00b1 7\n(Coplen et al. 2002). The solar photospheric ratio 16 O/18 O = 479 \u00b1 29 obtained\nby Scott et al. (2006) is consistent with the terrestrial value, but with larger\nuncertainties (although in fairness the terrestrial \"representative isotopic composition\" from Rosman & Taylor (1998) is equally uncertain: 487 \u00b1 35). Surprisingly, Ayres, Plymate & Keller (2006) found strongly sub-terrestrial ratios\n(e.g. 16 O/18 O = 440 \u00b1 20) from their analysis of the solar CO lines, probably\ndue to an inadequate consideration of the differing temperature sensitivities of\nthe isotopomer transitions with 1D model atmospheres (Scott et al. 2006). Lines\nfrom 12 C17 O are also visible in the solar infrared spectrum, but due to their\nextreme weakness their reliability as abundance indicators is questionable.\nFor Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe we adopt the recommended values of Wieler (2002)\nderived from solar wind and lunar sample analyses. Very similar ratios have recently been presented from preliminary studies of solar wind samples from the\nGenesis mission (Heber et al. 2008b). For Mo, Dy, Er, Yb and Lu we have exchanged the Rosman & Taylor (1998) values with the more recent measurements\ngiven in Lodders, Palme & Gail (2009). Similarly the proto-solar values given\nhere for the radioactive nuclides have been taken from the same source.\n\n3.11\n\nConversion From Photospheric to Bulk Abundances\n\nThe elemental abundances given in Table 1 are those currently present in the\nsolar photosphere and by extension the whole convection zone. Due to the\ncombined effects of thermal diffusion, gravitational settling and radiative acceleration (often referred to collectively as diffusion) over the past 4.56 Gyr,\nthe values in Table 1 differ slightly from the proto-solar chemical composition.\nIn comparison with present-day photospheric values, the bulk composition of\nthe Sun is higher by 0.05 dex for helium and 0.04 dex for the heavier elements\n(Turcotte & Wimmer-Schweingruber 2002). The uncertainty in the overall diffusion correction is judged to be about 0.01 dex. The element-to-element variation\nin the expected diffusion is very small (< 0.01 dex) and therefore currently not\nobservationally testable by a comparison of photospheric and meteoritic abundances. We note that Lodders (2003) adopted a somewhat larger correction,\n0.074 dex, than that of Turcotte & Wimmer-Schweingruber (2002). She based\nher estimate on the results of Boothroyd & Sackmann (2003), who computed\ntheir solar models using a less detailed diffusion model.\n\n\f24\n\nAsplund et al.\n\n3.12\n\nSolar metallicity\n\nWith the solar chemical composition we recommend here, the mass fractions of H,\nHe and metals in the present-day photosphere become X = 0.7381, Y = 0.2485\nand Z = 0.0134. The respective values for the bulk composition are 0.7154, 0.2703\nand 0.0142. In other words, the solar metallicity is no longer the canonical 2%\nrecommended by Anders & Grevesse (1989) but rather a substantially smaller\n1.4%. Indeed, the intervening years have seen a steady decrease in Z/X from\n0.027 to our preferred value of 0.018. This is illustrated in Table 4, which collects\nthe resulting mass fractions from a number of widely used compilations of the\nsolar chemical composition over the past two decades. Our metallicity reverses\nthis declining trend of Z with time by being slightly larger than advocated by\nAsplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005), which is mainly the result of the somewhat\nhigher C, O, Ne and Fe abundances.\nFor completeness, we note that the He abundances recommended by Anders & Grevesse\n(1989) and Grevesse & Noels (1993) were based on calibration of solar models and\nhence corresponded to bulk composition; here we have substituted those with the\nhelioseismic convection zone He content (Sect. 3.9) when computing the presentday photospheric values. Finally, from Table 4 it is clear that the surface He\nabundance employed by Lodders (2003) is too low on account of adopting a too\nefficient elemental diffusion, as discussed in Sect. 3.11.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nOTHER METHODS FOR INFERRING SOLAR ABUNDANCES\nMeteorites\n\nMeteoritic data on the elemental abundances constitute an excellent comparator\nfor the results from the solar photosphere presented above. Not all meteorites are\nsuitable for the purpose though; only a very small subsample are believed to accurately reflect the chemical composition of the proto-solar nebula, since the majority have undergone varying degrees of fractionation and alteration. The most\nprimitive, undifferentiated meteorites in this respect are the so-called CI (or C1)\ncarbonaceous chondrites, of which there are only five known: the Alais, Ivuna,\nOrgueil, Revelstoke and Tonk meteorites (Lodders 2003). Of these, Orgueil is\nthe by far largest and has therefore been exposed to the greatest number of\nanalyses. It should be noted that while CI chondrites are believed not to have\nbeen noticeably chemically fractionated, they have still been severely modified\nmineralogically by aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism. The main advantage of meteorites as a cosmic abundance standard is the extraordinarily high\nprecision obtained, even for isotopic abundances, through mass spectroscopy. It\ncomes at a cost, however, since the volatile elements H, C, N, O and the noble\ngases \u2013 which also happen to be the most abundant elements \u2013 have been severely\ndepleted. As a consequence, the abundances in meteorites are pegged to the Si\ncontent, rather than H as is the case in solar and stellar spectroscopy.\nThe mean abundances of CI chondrites presented in Table 1 have been appropriated from the data carefully compiled by Lodders, Palme & Gail (2009).\nTo place the meteoritic abundances (defined as NSi = 106 ) on the same absolute scale as for the photosphere (defined as log \u01ebH = 12.00), we have renormalized their data such that the meteoritic and photospheric Si abundances agree.\nThe relation between the two scales is thus specified as log \u01ebX = 1.51 + log NX .\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n25\n\nIn principle the conversion factor could employ additional elements besides Si;\nAnders & Grevesse (1989) for example used Na, Mg, Si, Ca, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Y,\nZr, Nb and Mo, while Lodders, Palme & Gail (2009) included as many as 39 elements. In practice, however, this does not change the result noticeably but it\nintroduces some degree of arbitrariness in the selection of elements to include in\nthis exercise. Fig. 7 shows the difference between the thus obtained photospheric\nand CI chondrite abundances, highlighting the excellent correspondence between\nthe two methods. Naturally all volatile elements are depleted in the meteorites,\nwhereas Li is depleted in the solar photosphere. For the other 45 elements with a\npurported photospheric uncertainty less than 25%, the mean difference between\nphotospheric and meteoritic abundances is 0.00 \u00b1 0.05 dex. The photospheric\nand meteoritic abundances differ by more than the total combined uncertainty\nfor only 10 out of the 57 non-volatile elements (expected \u2248 18/57), which suggests that our estimated errors are in fact slightly too conservative. It should be\nemphasized that this excellent agreement cannot be interpreted as an absence of\nany significant diffusion in the Sun (Sect. 3.11), as the meteoritic scale is set by\nSi; all elements heavier than He are fractionated by \u2248 0.04 dex relative to H but\nhardly at all relative to each other.\nIn spite of the excellent agreement overall illustrated in Fig. 7, there are a\nfew noticeable exceptions. Of the ten non-depleted elements where the solar and\nmeteoritic abundances differ by more than 0.1 dex (25%), this can in all cases\nbe blamed on uncertain photospheric analyses. Indeed, in many cases the two\nmethods still agree marginally within the combined errors (Cl, Au, Tl). We note\na significant improvement for W compared with previous compilations of the solar\nchemical composition (\u2206 log \u01eb = +0.49 dex in Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005)\nwhile here the difference amount to +0.20 dex); we suspect that unidentified\nblends and/or erroneous continuum placement may be at fault for the persisting\ndiscrepancy, as well as for Rb and Hf. For Co we reckon that the non-LTE\ncorrections by Bergemann (2008) are somewhat overestimated. The remaining\nthree elements Rh, Ag and Pb have had their photospheric values determined\nfrom transitions originating either in the ground state or from low-excitation\nlevels of the neutral species (also true for Pd, W and Au), which are prone to\nnon-LTE effects in their excitation and ionization populations (Asplund 2005).\n\n4.2\n\nSolar Neighborhood\n\nIndependent estimates of the chemical composition of the Sun are provided\nby solar-type stars, OB stars, H ii regions like the Orion nebula and the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood. In order to make a meaningful comparison one must first account for the effects of diffusion in the Sun\nand Galactic chemical enrichment. The former amounts to 0.04 dex for metals (Turcotte & Wimmer-Schweingruber 2002, cf. Sect. 3.11) while the latter is\ntypically predicted to be 0.05 \u2212 0.15 dex depending on the element in question\n(Chiappini, Romano & Matteucci 2003; Prantzos 2008).\nWhether the Sun is somehow special in its chemical composition relative to\nother FG dwarfs in the Galactic thin disk has attracted attention over the years\n(e.g. Gustafsson 2008, Robles et al. 2008, and references therein). It should\nbe borne in mind that most large-scale abundance analyses of Galactic thin\ndisk stars to date (e.g. Bensby et al. 2005, Edvardsson et al. 1993, Fuhrmann\n2008, Ram\u0131\u0301rez, Allende Prieto & Lambert 2007, Reddy et al. 2003) have been\n\n\f26\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nperformed differentially relative to the Sun to remove the uncertainties from\ngf -values and to minimize systematic errors due to inadequacies in the stellar\nmodelling. These studies therefore reveal little about the absolute abundances of\nthe stars but do imply that the Sun is a rather ordinary thin disk G dwarf for its\nage. In his volume-complete sample of stars within 25 pc, Fuhrmann (2008) found\na mean spectroscopic metallicity of [Fe/H]= \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.18. Similarly, among the\nstars within 40 kpc having an isochrone age of 4-6 Gyr, Holmberg, Nordstr\u00f6m & Andersen\n(2008) obtained a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]= \u22120.00 \u00b1 0.10. In their study of\n11 solar twins, Mel\u00e9ndez et al. (2009) found that the solar X/Fe ratios did not\ndiffer by more than 0.06 dex from the mean of the solar twin sample for any of\nthe 23 investigated elements.\nIn the past, the Sun appeared to be metal-rich compared with, for example,\nyoung OB stars in the solar neighborhood, despite the expected chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr. In the meantime, the solar abundances have decreased\nand the hot star abundances have increased. The latter have also become more\naccurate, as reflected in greatly diminished uncertainties (e.g. Daflon & Cunha\n2004, Morel 2008, Nieva & Przybilla 2006). Arguably the most accurate result\nto date is the analysis of Przybilla, Nieva & Butler (2008), who have carried out\na non-LTE study of six nearby B-type main sequence stars. Their results are\npresented in Table 5; for S we give the mean abundance from Morel et al. (2006)\nwhile the Ar abundance is taken from Lanz et al. (2008). When accounting for\ndiffusion in the Sun, there is good agreement between the solar and hot star\nabundances for O, Ne and Mg in particular. While the situation has greatly\nimproved compared with the solar abundances of Grevesse & Sauval (1998) and\nearlier compilations, there is still a tendency for the solar C, N and Fe abundances to be somewhat higher than in the B stars, contrary to expectations. It\nis unclear whether the solution can be found in the solar or B star analyses or, if\na real difference indeed exists, perhaps due to infall of low-metallicity gas to the\nsolar neighborhood.\nThe abundances of nearby H ii regions like the Orion nebula also provide constraints on the solar chemical composition. In Table 5 we provide the values from\nEsteban et al. (2004), Esteban et al. (2005) and Garc\u0131\u0301a-Rojas & Esteban (2007)\ninterpolated to a Galacto-centric radius of 8 kpc. The observed scatter between\nindividual H ii regions is now quite small and the inferred present-day Galactic\nabundance gradient well determined. It is worth remembering that there are\nmultiple potential pitfalls in the analyses of H ii regions, including corrections for\nunseen ionization stages and the effects of temperature fluctuations in the nebula. Furthermore, abundances derived from recombination (permitted) lines are\noften significantly larger than the corresponding values from collisionally excited\n(forbidden) lines. Finally, dust condensation needs to be taken into account for\nsome elements. For C and O this somewhat uncertain dust correction amounts to\n\u2248 0.1 dex in Orion (Esteban et al. 2004). Volatile elements like Ne and S are not\nexpected to form dust but refractory elements like Mg and Fe are predominantly\nin the solid phase, so it is therefore not possible to deduce a meaningful total\nelemental abundance for them. Overall, the agreement between the Sun and H ii\nregions is very satisfactory when accounting for diffusion and a minor chemical\nenrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr.\nBecause of the generally lower temperatures encountered and the consequentially larger degree of dust condensation, the interstellar medium is a less reliable\nchemical composition gauge than H ii regions (Jenkins 2004). Indeed, rather\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n27\n\nthan setting constraints on the solar abundances, the Sun is often used to infer the amount in the solid phase in the interstellar medium (e.g. Sofia & Meyer\n2001). The local abundances of the volatile elements C (Sofia et al. 2004), N\n(Jensen, Rachford & Snow 2007) and O (Cartledge et al. 2006, Jensen, Rachford & Snow\n2005) in the interstellar medium support our recommended solar values in general. With the older, high (log \u01ebO = 8.83 \u2212 8.93) solar abundances preferred by\nGrevesse & Sauval (1998) and Anders & Grevesse (1989) it becomes very challenging to hide sufficient amounts of O in dust (Jensen 2007). The gas phase\nabundances of the refractory elements is only a small fraction of the total abundance in both the cold and warm interstellar medium, preventing them from\nsetting any stringent constraints.\nAlso listed in Table 5 are predictions from models of Galactic chemical evolution\n(Chiappini, Romano & Matteucci 2003). Indeed, with these values it becomes\ndifficult to reconcile the solar abundances with the results from OB stars and\nH ii regions for some elements like Fe. It is important to bear in mind though\nthat the models have varying degrees of reliability for different elements. The\nevolutionary predictions for O, Ne and Mg should be the most accurate, as they\nare produced in hydrostatic burning and ejected by SNe II; in fact for these elements there is good agreement between the Sun and its local neighborhood. All\nother elements are either produced in explosive burning and therefore dependent\non the adopted mass-cut in the supernova explosion, or have a non-negligible\ncontribution from SNe Ia or AGB stars, making theoretical estimates rather uncertain. One may conclude that the local Galactic volume has had a smaller\nstar formation rate than assumed in these chemical evolution models. This inference is born out empirically by the observed age-metallicity relation, which\nHolmberg, Nordstr\u00f6m & Andersen (2008) estimated to be only 0.018 dex/Gyr for\n[Fe/H] in the solar neighborhood, i.e. only half of the predictions given in Table\n5. An alternative explanation would be recent Galactic infall of more pristine\ngas.\n\n4.3\n\nHelioseismology\n\nThe situation is decidedly less encouraging when attempting to assess the solar abundances by means of helioseismology. Since the various solar oscillation\np-modes penetrate to different depths, it is possible to thereby map the variation of the sound speed in the solar interior, which can be compared with the\npredicted values from solar structure models (see Basu & Antia 2008, for a detailed review). With the Grevesse & Sauval (1998) abundances, the predicted\nsound speed as a function of depth from standard solar models shows a very\ngood agreement with the helioseismic values. When instead employing the revised values of Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005), this is no longer the case (e.g.\nBahcall et al. 2005, Basu & Antia 2004, 2008, Delahaye & Pinsonneault 2006,\nGuzik, Watson & Cox 2005, Turck-Chi\u00e8ze et al. 2004). In this context it is perhaps fair to say that 'better is worse'. The sound speed discrepancy most clearly\nshows up immediately below the bottom of the convection zone, as illustrated\nin Fig. 8. Also with the Grevesse & Sauval (1998) abundances there was a disagreement in this region but it is greatly aggravated by the further lowering of\nthe solar O and Ne abundances and to a lesser extent by the reassessment of C,\nN and Fe. With the solar chemical composition recommended here, the situation\nis alleviated somewhat due to the slightly higher abundances of these elements\n\n\f28\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nand consequently larger opacity in the radiative interior but the deviation is still\nhighly significant.\nIt is not only the sound speed variation that is at variance when using the new\nsolar abundances. The inferred depth of the convection zone is now too shallow:\nRBCZ \u2248 0.725 R\u2299 instead of the helioseismic measurement 0.7133 \u00b1 0.0005 R\u2299\n(Basu & Antia 2004). Furthermore, the resulting He abundance when calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct solar luminosity and temperature\nat the solar age is similarly inconsistent with the value inferred from helioseismology (see Sect. 3.9): YS \u2248 0.238 compared with the observed 0.2485 \u00b1 0.0034\n(Basu & Antia 2004), where YS is the present-day He mass fraction at the surface. The problem also persists in the solar core both as implied by low-degree\np-modes (Chaplin et al. 2007) and by gravity modes (Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2007). Thus\nthe problem exists both in the convective envelope, the radiative interior and in\nthe core.\nFollowing the initial revisions of the solar C and O abundances by Allende Prieto, Lambert\n(2001) and Allende Prieto, Lambert & Asplund (2002), many possible solutions\nhave been put forward to explain the problem albeit to date with little success.\nThe most obvious explanation would be that the opacities are underestimated.\nBahcall et al. (2005) estimated that a 10 \u2212 20% increase of the OPAL opacities\nover a relatively substantial fraction of the solar interior (R = 0.4 \u2212 0.7 R\u2299 or\nequivalently T = 2 \u2212 5 * 106 K) would be required; Christensen-Dalsgaard et al.\n(2009) found even slightly more stringent requirements with the Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval\n(2005) solar abundances. Serenelli et al. (2009) have investigated the differences\nwith the solar chemical composition presented here and conclude that \u2264 12%\nextra opacity is required to restore the previous agreement in sound speed. Little suggests, however, that current atomic physics calculations for stellar interiors\nare missing such a substantial fraction of the opacity. For example, Badnell et al.\n(2005) showed that opacities from the Opacity Project are at most 3% larger\nthan the corresponding OPAL values in the relevant temperature range. While\nunlikely to cure the problem by itself, it is perhaps wise to bear in mind that a\nsimilar situation for pulsating stars in fact existed in the 1980s, which found an\nunexpected resolution with the more comprehensive calculations by the OPAL\nand OP collaborations.\nThere are other ways to compensate for the lower opacities resulting from the\nlower C, N, O and Ne abundances. One is that the radiative interior contains\nmore metals than expected from the photospheric abundances and standard models for diffusion. Asplund et al. (2004) first suggested that the diffusion efficiency\nmay be seriously underestimated but the required elemental settlement is about\ntwice the predicted value. Furthermore, while this may remedy the sound speed\ndiscrepancy, problems still remain in terms of the He abundance and depth of the\nconvection zone (Guzik, Watson & Cox 2005, Montalb\u00e1n et al. 2004, Yang & Bi\n2007). A hypothetical late accretion of metal-depleted gas during the formation of the Sun runs into the same trouble (Castro, Vauclair & Richard 2007;\nGuzik, Watson & Cox 2005). Alternatively, the reduced O abundance could conceivably be compensated by a corresponding but larger increase in the Ne abundance (Antia & Basu 2005). Bahcall, Basu & Serenelli (2005) estimated that a\nfactor of three (0.5 dex) higher Ne content compared with the recommended values by Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005), together with minor adjustments of\nC, N, O and Ar within their associated uncertainties would restore the good\nagreement found with the Grevesse & Sauval (1998) solar composition. There\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n29\n\nwas initial excitement when Drake & Testa (2005) argued for exactly such an\nincrease in Ne based on inferences from coronal spectroscopy of other stars but\nthere is in fact little support for this idea, as explained in Sect. 3.9. The here\nrecommended abundance of Ne as well as of C, N, O and Fe are \u2248 0.05 dex\nhigher than in Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005). This shift only partly allays\nthe solar modelling discrepancy, as seen in Fig. 8.\nGiven that the problem exceeds the likely uncertainties in existing input data\n(e.g. opacities, diffusion, abundances), the only remaining option on the solar\ninterior side seems to be to invoke some physical process not yet accounted for\nin standard solar models. It is perhaps suggestive that the largest deviation occurs immediately below the convection zone. Arnett, Meakin & Young (2005)\nhave proposed that internal gravity waves generated by the convective motion\nat the base of the convection zone propagate inwards and deposit their energy\nin the radiative zone. The ensuing structure changes are similar to an opacity\nenhancement, thus going in the right direction. In addition, the gravity waves\ninduce additional mixing, which would also help. Young & Arnett (2005) have\ninvestigated these processes using multi-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations\nof stellar convection zones and found qualitative improvements in many stellar\nregimes. Due to the computationally very challenging nature of the hydrodynamics, the modelling is unfortunately not yet able to quantitatively predict whether\nthe effects are sufficient to explain the helioseismic signature.\nThus, most suggestions to resolve the solar modelling discrepancy have already\nbeen ruled out or are considered improbable. The few possibilities still standing do so largely because no detailed modelling has as yet been forthcoming to\nproperly put the proposals to test. It is possible though that a combination of\nseveral factors could be the explanation, but such fine-tuning would seem rather\ncontrived. Should no likely solution be found, it would suggest that the photospheric abundances presented herein are wrong. Given the discussion in Sect. 2\nand Sect. 3, it is not easy to understand where such a serious error may lie but\nthe possibility should obviously not be discounted.\n\n4.4\n\nSolar neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos provide another means by which to infer the solar chemical composition, though current experiments are not yet sufficiently sensitive to return\ndecisive results in this respect. The metallicity adopted in a solar model modifies the conditions in the core, and thus the neutrino fluxes produced by the\npp-chain and CNO-cycle. Whilst the neutrino fluxes cannot be directly associated with abundances of individual elements, the relevant neutrino channels\ndepend most sensitively on C, N, O, Si and Fe (Bahcall & Serenelli 2005). Using\nneutrino data from the SuperKamiokande I+II, SNO and Borexino experiments,\nPena-Garay & Serenelli (2008) have derived the neutrino oscillations and fluxes\nexpected from solar models constructed with the Grevesse & Sauval (1998) and\nAsplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005) compositions. Intriguingly, the existing data\nimply 7 Be and 8 B neutrino fluxes that fall between the predictions for the two\nmodels; we suspect that the solar neutrinos would favour the new abundances\npresented herein. A more direct test of the heavily debated solar C, N and\nO abundances would come from measuring the 13 N and 15 O \u03b2-decay neutrinos\nthat follow proton capture on 12 C and 14 N, respectively. Meaningful constraints\nshould come from Borexino within the next couple of years, and the proposed\n\n\f30\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nSNO+ experiment should weigh in with a definite answer sometime after 2011\n(Haxton & Serenelli 2008).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nSummary Points\n\nWe have critically examined all ingredients for the determination of the solar photospheric chemical composition, from the atmospheric and line formation modelling, required atomic data and selection of lines to the final estimate of the\nelemental abundances and associated errors (Sect. 3). A notable feature of this\nanalysis is that for essentially every element, the effects of 3D hydrodynamical\nmodel atmospheres have now been accounted for. The 3D solar model employed\nhere outperforms any 1D model, theoretical or semi-empirical, in a raft of observational tests. The values we recommend for the most abundant metals C, N, O,\nNe and Fe are significantly smaller (by \u223c 0.2 dex) than those advocated in the\nwidely-used compilation of Anders & Grevesse (1989). Most of these differences\ncan be attributed to the improvements over the past two decades in modelling\nthe solar atmosphere, allowing for departures from LTE in the line formation,\nproperly treating blends and employing improved atomic and molecular data\n(Sect. 2). Amongst other things, these new, lower abundances are supported by\nthe excellent agreement between different abundance indicators for C, N and O:\nlow-excitation forbidden atomic lines, high-excitation permitted atomic lines and\nvarious molecular features.\nA comparison of the photospheric abundances and the most primitive class of\nmeteorites, the CI chondrites, reveals a very good agreement for nearly all nonvolatile elements (Sect. 4.1). Since the volatile elements, including H, have been\ndepleted in the chondrites, the meteoritic abundance scale has been placed on the\nsame absolute level as the photospheric abundances by enforcing equivalence of\nthe Si abundances. The remaining few elements (Rb, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Pb) that\nsuggest a significant difference between meteorites and the Sun can probably\nbe attributed to poor solar determinations, likely due to incorrect gf -values,\nunidentified blends or unaccounted non-LTE effects.\nIn order to make a meaningful comparison between the Sun and the abundances\nmeasured in the solar neighborhood, one must first correct for the effects of\ndiffusion in the Sun and chemical enrichment in the Galaxy over the past 4.56 Gyr.\nAll elements are predicted to have settled to the solar interior by essentially the\nsame amount, meaning that the bulk, or equivalently the proto-solar, composition\nis higher by 0.04 dex than listed in Table 1 for all elements heavier than He\n(Sect. 3.11). Our recommended solar abundances agree very well in general with\nthose measured in nearby OB stars, H ii regions like Orion and the local ISM\n(Sect. 4.2). We note that care should be exercised when comparing our solar\nresults with corresponding abundances for late-type stars derived with classical\n1D model atmospheres; ideally a differential study of the stars and the Sun should\nbe performed and using the solar abundances presented in Table 1 to place them\non an absolute scale.\nIn spite of the many apparent successes of the solar chemical composition we\nrecommend here, the outlook is not entirely rosy. With the downward revision\nof the overall metal content presented here compared to the Grevesse & Sauval\n(1998) abundances, the previous excellent agreement between predicted sound\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n31\n\nspeeds from standard solar models and those inferred from helioseismology is\nruined (Sect. 4.3). To date there has been no fully convincing solution put\nforward. The discordance has been alleviated somewhat relative to the recommended values in Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval (2005) but it nevertheless remains\na significant discrepancy in urgent need of resolution.\n\n5.2\n\nFuture Issues\n\nWhile major progress has been made in recent years in the inferred solar chemical composition, there is no question that a great deal of work remains before\nwe can confidently state that each solar elemental abundance is known to better than 0.01 dex (2%). For many, if not most elements, the achieved accuracy\ntoday is more like 0.05 dex or indeed significantly worse in many cases. A concerted effort on multiple fronts is required to substantially decrease the remaining\nuncertainties.\nWe do not consider it likely that subsequent generations of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres will dramatically (i.e. at the > 0.1 dex level) amend\nthe inferred solar photospheric chemical composition, given how successful the\nmost recent models are in reproducing key observational diagnostics. It is fair\nto say that the mean temperature structure of the quiet solar granulation, the\nvelocity distribution and the atmospheric inhomogeneities are now rather well\nknown, at least in the formation regions of the weaker lines largely employed by\nthe abundance studies described herein. Higher atmospheric layers, to which the\nstrongest atomic and molecular lines are more sensitive, are naturally less constrained observationally; on the modelling side this requires improved radiative\ntransfer treatment and allowance of departures from LTE for key elements. For\ncompleteness, one should include the effects of magnetic fields in the 3D solar\natmospheric models, but we do not expect that these will noticeably influence\nthe derived abundances (Nordlund, Stein & Asplund 2009).\nThe greatest uncertainties afflicting solar abundance work today instead stem\nfrom poor atomic and molecular data, and incomplete modelling of departures\nfrom LTE. Few spectral lines have their transition probabilities determined to better than a few %. As an example here it suffices to mention the case of Mg with\nits relatively simple atomic structure: the majority of the Mg i lines employed\nhere and elsewhere for solar abundance purposes still have quoted uncertainties\nof 25 \u2212 50% according to the NIST database, which is clearly unacceptable. Fortunately there has been some laudable progress on this score in recent years,\nboth in terms of experimental efforts (e.g. Blackwell-Whitehead & Bergemann\n2007, Johansson et al. 2003, Lawler et al. 2009), and theoretical calculations (e.g.\nBadnell et al. 2005, Kurucz 1992, Plez 1998) as discussed in Sect. 2.2. A major\nproblem, however, is the dearth of atomic physicists devoted to satisfying the\nastronomical need for various types of input data; the astronomical community\nought to better appreciate and encourage the relatively few individuals carrying\nout this important work, given its tremendous benefit for solar and stellar astrophysics especially. On the wish-list are improved gf -values for Mg i, Mg ii,\nSi ii, Ca ii, the once-ionized species of the Fe-peak elements, Cu i and Sr ii. Also,\natomic lines in the IR have great potential given the accurate determination of\nthe continuum and few blends but more often than not accurate transition probabilities are lacking.\nEqually important is the consideration of non-LTE effects on line formation.\n\n\f32\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nAs discussed by Asplund (2005), even though departures from LTE are expected\nto be relatively serene in the Sun, one should always expect non-LTE abundance\ncorrections at around the 0.05 dex level; indeed in many cases the effects will be\nsignificantly more severe. Still today, most elements have not been exposed to a\ndetailed non-LTE study even in the Sun. Even rarer are solar abundance works\ngoing beyond the 1D framework and employing 3D non-LTE calculations (e.g.\nAsplund, Carlsson & Botnen 2003, Asplund et al. 2004). In part, the scarcity of\nnon-LTE studies is related to a lack of adequate atomic data. Compared with the\nLTE case, vastly more input data are required in non-LTE calculations than are\npresently available for most elements. Significant headway will only become possible with the advent of detailed photo-ionization and collisional cross-sections;\nfor the latter, estimates of the impact of both electron and hydrogen collisions, as\nwell as other processes like charge transfer, are urgently needed. There is also an\nissue of manpower; careful non-LTE studies are very time-consuming and there\nare not enough specialists working in the field to satisfy the demand. Finally, we\nnote that non-LTE line formation should be explored in 3D model atmospheres,\nsince the the presence of atmospheric inhomogeneities is generally expected to\namplify any existing non-LTE effects seen in 1D.\nA section on future issues in the solar chemical composition would not be complete without stressing the importance of finally resolving the solar modelling\nproblem uncovered by helioseismology (Sect. 4.3). Many hypotheses have been\nput forward to explain the discrepancy, but no clear solution has been forthcoming. Until an explanation has been found, a mutual cloud of doubt will always\nlinger over the solar chemical composition recommended here and current models\nof the solar interior. Whether the problem will be traced in the end to shortcomings in the atmospheric or interior modelling remains to be seen, but whatever\nthe resolution it will place solar and stellar astrophysics \u2013 and by extension most\nof astronomy \u2013 on a much firmer footing.\n\n5.3\n\nDisclosure Statement\n\nThe authors are not aware of any affiliations, memberships, funding, or financial\nholdings that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.\n\n5.4\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are indebted to our collaborators over the years for their important contribution to uncovering the solar chemical composition.

The results for five different viewing angles \u03bc are shown\nfrom near disk center (\u03bc = 0.9) to close to the limb (\u03bc = 0.1). All intensities are\nnormalized to the corresponding disk-center intensities. The 3D hydrodynamical\nmodel (Trampedach et al. 2009) outperforms even the Holweger & M\u00fcller (1974)\nsemi-empirical model, which was designed to satisfy this diagnostic (Pereira et al.\n2009). As for all 1D theoretical model atmospheres, the marcs model has a too\nsteep temperature gradient, which manifests itself in a poor agreement with the\ncenter-to-limb variation.\n\n\f49\n\nThe chemical composition of the Sun\n\n1.1\n\nNormalized intensity\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n649.88\n\n649.89\n649.90\nWavelength [nm]\n\n649.91\n\nFigure 3: The predicted spectral line profile of a typical Fe i line from the 3D\nhydrodynamical solar model (red solid line) compared with the observations (blue\nrhombs). The agreement is clearly very satisfactory, which is the result of the\nDoppler shifts arising from the self-consistently computed convective motions that\nbroaden, shift and skew the theoretical profile. For comparison purposes also the\npredicted profile from a 1D model atmosphere (here Holweger & M\u00fcller 1974) is\nshown; the 1D profile has been computed with a microturbulence of 1 km s\u22121 and\na tuned macroturbulence to obtain the right overall linewidth. Note that even\nwith these two free parameters the 1D profile can neither predict the shift nor\nthe asymmetry of the line.\n\n\f50\n\nAsplund et al.\n\nLogarithmic abundance [dex]\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nAtomic number\n\n80\n\nFigure 4: The present-day solar photospheric elemental abundances as a function\nof atomic number.

The theoretical curves are the results of full 3D non-LTE line formation calculations with different adopted efficiency for the poorly known inelastic H collisions; the O abundances have been normalized to fit the disk-center\nline strengths in each case. The curves are labelled with the scaling factor\nused to multiply the classical Drawin (1968) formula.
