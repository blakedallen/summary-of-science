It is known that although Dirac's equation for a massive spin 1/2 particle is not conformal invariant, it too has an so(4, 2) invariance algebra. It is shown here\nthat the algebra of operators associated with a 4-component massless\nparticle, or two flavors of 2-component massless particles, can be deformed into the algebra of operators associated with a spin 1/2 particle\nwith positive rest mass. It is speculated that this may be exploited to\ndescribe massless neutrino mixing.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Asim Barut's name became synonymous with the\napplications to quantum mechanics of the Lie algebra so(4, 2), whether as\na space-time (conformal) symmetry algebra [1], as a spectrum generating\nalgebra in generalised Coulomb problems [2], or as an algebra associated\nwith Dirac's equation for the electron [3]. I would like to revisit from that\nperiod an idea involving so(4, 2) that may have renewed relevance because of\nthe subsequent discovery of several neutrino types, some of which may have\nsmall rest masses.\nIt is well known that the massless Dirac equation is not only Poincar\u00e9 invariant but also so(4, 2) (conformal) invariant [4]. More surprising is that\nthe massive Dirac equation also has an so(4, 2) invariance algebra [5]. The\nsolution spaces of these two equations each carry hermitian representations\nof that Lie algebra. However, only in the massless case can this algebra be\ninterpreted as the Lie algebra of the conformal group. In the massive case,\nthe so(4, 2) invariance algebra contains the physical homogeneous Lorentz\nsubalgebra, but not the generators of the physical translations, dilatations\nor special conformal transformations.\nWhat was done in Ref.[5] was to construct, from the operators spanning the\nusual hermitian representation of the Poincar\u00e9 Lie algebra on the positiveenergy solution space of the massive Dirac equation, a set of operators\nthat span another, inequivalent hermitian irreducible representation of the\nPoincar\u00e9 Lie algebra \u2013 and of its extension, the Lie algebra so(4, 2) \u2013 of the\ntype appropriate for the description of a massless particle with a definite\nhelicity. What will be shown below is that if two types of four-component\nneutrinos are considered, and if a parameter with the dimensions of mass is\nintroduced, then we can construct from the algebra of operators for the massless particles, a set of operators that span a representation of the Poincar\u00e9\nLie algebra appropriate to the description of a spin 1/2 particle with nonzero\nrest mass. In short, the operator algebra for the set of massless particles can\nbe deformed into the operator algebra of a massive particle, acting on the\nsame vector space.\nThe observed mixing of the three known neutrino types is thought to be\n1\n\n\finexplicable unless some types have nonzero rest masses [6]. Neutrino masses\nhave not been measured directly, but it is believed that if they are nonzero,\nthen they are very small compared with the rest mass of the electron. This\ngives renewed relevance to the the notions of conformal invariance in the\nmassless case, and so(4, 2) invariance in the massive case, and the relationship\nbetween the two.\n\n2\n\nMassless and massive Dirac equations, and\nso(4, 2) invariance.\n\nThe space of positive energy solutions of the massless Dirac equation\n(\u03b3 * P ) \u03c8(x) \u2261 \u03b3\u03bc P \u03bc \u03c8(x) = 0 ,\n\nP\u03bc = i\u2202/\u2202x\u03bc ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhen restricted by the helicity condition\n\u03b35 \u03c8(x) = \u00b1 \u03c8(x) ,\n\n(2)\n\ncarries a unitary representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group appropriate to the\ndescription of a massless particle with helicity \u22131/2. Here x = (x\u03bc ), \u03bc =\n0, 1, 2, 3, and the Dirac matrices \u03b3 \u03bc satisfy\n{\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd } = 2g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u03b35 = i\u03b30 \u03b31 \u03b32 \u03b33 .\n\n(3)\n\nWe choose the diagonal metric tensor with g 00 = \u2212g 11 = \u2212g 22 = \u2212g 33 = 1,\nand set both ~ and c equal to 1.\nThis representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group extends to a unitary representation of the conformal group, with generators MAB = \u2212MBA , A, B =\n0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, given by [1, 4]\n1\nM\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bc\u03bd = x\u03bc P\u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd P\u03bc + i[\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ] ,\n4\n3\nM56 = D = x * P + i ,\n2\n\nM\u03bc6 \u2212 M\u03bc5 = P\u03bc ,\n\nM\u03bc6 + M\u03bc5 = K\u03bc = x\u03bc (2D + i) \u2212 (x * x) P\u03bc \u2212 i(\u03b3 * x)\u03b3\u03bc .\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fThese satisfy the commutation relations\n[MAB , MCD ] =\n\u2212i (gAC MBD + gBD MAC \u2212 gAD MBC \u2212 gBC MAD ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the extended metric tensor is diagonal with g55 = \u22121, g66 = 1. It is at\nonce clear from (5) and the form of this diagonal metric that the Lie algebra\nof the conformal group is isomorphic to so(4, 2).\nWe consider a 4-component massless particle, described by (1) but now without the fixed helicity condition (2). Noting that the generators (4) are not\nall dimensionless, we also introduce a parameter M > 0 with the dimensions\nof a mass (or an inverse length, since we have set ~ = c = 1). Then we can\nmodify the conformal algebra (4) to give a new set of dimensionless operators\nNAB that satisfy the same so(4, 2) relations (5) as the MAB , namely\nN\u03bc\u03bd = M\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bc\u03bd ,\nN\u03bc5 =\n\n\u0001\n1\nMK\u03bc \u2212 P\u03bc /M ,\n2\n\nN56 = \u03b35 D ,\n\n\u0001\n1\nN\u03bc6 = \u03b35 MK\u03bc + P\u03bc /M .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nOur motivation for the change from the MAB to the NAB , as will become\nclearer below, is to make the operator structure in the massless case mirror\nthat for the massive Dirac equation\n(\u03b3 * P ) \u03c8(x) = m \u03c8(x) ,\n\n(7)\n\nfor which the corresponding so(4, 2) invariance algebra is spanned by the\noperators TAB defined by [5]\nT\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bc\u03bd ,\nT\u03bc5 =\n\n1\nT56 = J = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 J\u03bc\u03bd J\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n4\n\n1\n{J\u03bc\u03bd , P \u03bd } ,\n2m\n\nT\u03bc6 =\n\n1\n{P\u03bc , J} .\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nHere { , } denotes the anticommutator, and \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is the alternating tensor\nwith \u01eb0123 = 1. Once again, the operators TAB satisfy relations of the form\n(5).\n3\n\n\fThe key to understanding the rather surpising so(4, 2) invariance of the massive Dirac equation is that, when regarded as reducible representations of the\nhomogeneous Lorentz Lie algebra so(3, 1), two irreducible representations of\nthe Poincar\u00e9 Lie algebra are equivalent[8]: the one appropriate to the description of a positive energy massless particle with definite helicity, equal\nto either +1/2 or \u22121/2; and the other appropriate to the description of a\npositive energy massive particle with spin 1/2. Each of these reducible representations of so(3, 1) extends to an hermitian representation of so(4, 2). It\nis for this reason that the J\u03bc\u03bd , as generators of homogeneous Lorentz transformations for the massless particle, can be identified with the N\u03bc\u03bd as in (6);\nand similarly that as generators of homogeneous Lorentz transformations for\nthe massive particle, they can be identified with the T\u03bc\u03bd as in (8).\nIt is known that the operators (4) satisfy certain characteristic 'representation relations' [9], and the same is true of the operators (6) and (8). More\ngenerally, and more importantly, the similar structures of the algebras of operators associated with the massless particles and with the massive particle\nenable us now to proceed towards our goal.\n\n3\n\nDeformation of the massless algebra to the\nmassive algebra.\n\nOur problem is to construct, on the space of solutions of the 4-component\nmassless Dirac equation (1), a set of operators P\u03bc , J\u03bc\u03bd that satisfy the defining\nrelations of a representation of the Poincar\u00e9 Lie algebra, appropriate for the\ndescription of a spin 1/2 particle with rest mass M. We do not deform the\nhomogeneous Lorentz subalgebra, and take J\u03bc\u03bd = J\u03bc\u03bd as in (4).\nIn order to proceed with the construction of P\u03bc , we first see how the operator\nP\u03bc is embedded in the operator algebra associated with the massive Dirac\nequation (7, 8). Although T\u03bc5 and T\u03bc6 are expressed in terms of the P\u03bc and\nJ\u03bc\u03bd in (8), it is not possible to invert these relations and express P\u03bc in terms\nof the J\u03bc\u03bd , T\u03bc5 and T\u03bc6 alone. There are three independent 4-vectors acting\non the space of solutions to (7).

The operators P\u03bc and W\u03bc so modified leave\n9\n\n\finvariant the space of solutions of (1) and the modified helicity condition.\nIn this way, the operator algebra associated with two flavors of 2-component\nmassless particles can also be deformed to obtain the algebra of a single spin\n1/2 particle with positive rest mass.\nFrom a geometric point of view it is notable that non-null 4-vector operators P\u03bc and W\u03bc can be constructed on the state space of a set of massless\nparticles, for which the 4-vector operators P\u03bc and K\u03bc are null.\nIt is hoped that these results can be exploited to describe the mixing of\nneutrino types without the introduction of neutrino rest masses.\n\nReferences\n[1] Barut, A.O. and Brittin, W.E., De Sitter and Conformal Groups and\ntheir Applications, Lecture Notes in Theoretical Physics Vol. XIII (Colorado Associated University Press, Boulder, 1971).\n[2] Barut, A.O., Dynamical Groups and Generalized Symmetries in Quantum Theory, (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, NZ, 1971).\n[3] Barut, A.O. and Bracken, A.J., \"Zitterbewegung and the internal geometry of the electron,\" Phys.
