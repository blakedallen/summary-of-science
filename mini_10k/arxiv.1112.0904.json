Single-longitudinal spin asymmetries in\nW -boson production have been observed at RHIC and will ultimately give new insights into the\nlight quark and anti-quark helicity structure of the nucleon.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQCD spin physics has been driven by the hugely successful experimental program of polarized deeplyinelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (DIS) [1]. One of the most important results has been the finding\nthat the quark and anti-quark spins (summed over all flavors) provide only about a quarter of the\nnucleon's spin, \u2206\u03a3 \u2248 0.25 in the proton helicity sum rule [2]:\n1\n1\n= \u2206\u03a3 + \u2206G + Lq + Lg .\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nThis result implies that sizable contributions to the nucleon spin should come from the gluon spin\ncontribution \u2206G, or from orbital angular momenta Lq,g of partons. To determine the other contributions\nto the nucleon spin has become a key focus of the field. In the present article, we describe some of\nthe recent developments of the field. We focus on current efforts to determine the helicity parton\ndistributions of the nucleon and on the latest experimental results.\nThe helicity structure of the nucleon is foremost described by its twist-two helicity parton distribution\nfunctions,\n \u0304 s\u0304, g) ,\n\u2206f (x, Q2 ) \u2261 f + (x, Q2 ) \u2212 f \u2212 (x, Q2 )\n(f = u, d, s, \u016b, d,\n(2)\n\u2217\n\nTalk presented by W. Vogelsang\n\n1\n\n\ff + (f \u2212 ) denoting the number density of partons with the same (opposite) helicity as the nucleon's, as a\nfunction of momentum fraction x and scale Q. QCD predicts the Q2 -dependence of the densities through\nthe spin-dependent Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations [3]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nd\n\u2206q\n\u2206Pqq (\u03b1s , x) \u2206Pqg (\u03b1s , x)\n\u2206q\n2\n(x, Q ) =\n\u2297\nx, Q2 ,\n(3)\n2\n\u2206g\n\u2206Pgq (\u03b1s , x) \u2206Pgg (\u03b1s , x)\n\u2206g\nd ln Q\nwhere \u2297 denotes a convolution, and the splitting functions \u2206Pij are evaluated in QCD perturbation\ntheory [3, 4, 5].\nThe contributions \u2206\u03a3(Q2 ) and \u2206G(Q2 ) in the helicity sum rule (1) are given by\nZ 1\n\u0001\n2\n\u2206u + \u2206\u016b + \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304 + \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 (x, Q2 )dx \u2261 \u2206\u03a3u + \u2206\u03a3d + \u2206\u03a3s ,\n(4)\n\u2206\u03a3(Q ) =\n0\n\n\u2206G(Q2 ) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u2206g(x, Q2 )dx .\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\n\u2206\u03a3 is independent of Q2 at the lowest order. The distributions have a proper field-theoretic definition.\nFor example, in case of \u2206g it is given by [6]\nZ\ni\n+\n2\n\u2206g(x, Q ) =\nd\u03bb ei\u03bbxP hP, S|G+\u03bd (0) G\u0303+\u03bd (\u03bbn)|P, Si\n,\n(6)\n+\n4\u03c0 x P\nQ2\nwritten in A+ = 0 gauge. Here, G\u03bc\u03bd is the QCD field strength tensor, and G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd its dual. The integral\nof \u2206g(x, Q2 ) over all momentum fractions x becomes a local operator only in A+ = 0 gauge and then\ncoincides with \u2206G(Q2 ) [2].\nThe helicity parton distributions may be probed in spin asymmetries for reactions at large momentum transfer. The probes used so far are inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic lepton scattering\n(DIS and SIDIS, respectively), and pp scattering at large transverse momentum, see Fig. 1. Polarized\nDIS and SIDIS experiments have been carried out at SLAC, CERN, DESY and the Jefferson Laboratory\n[1] and mostly constrain the quark and anti-quark\u221ahelicity distributions. RHIC at BNL [7, 8] is the\nfirst polarized proton-proton collider, operating at s = 200 and 500 GeV. The measurement of gluon\npolarization in the proton is a major focus and strength of RHIC.\nThe basic theoretical concept that underlies much of spin physics is the factorization theorem. It\nstates that large momentum-transfer reactions may be factorized into long-distance pieces that contain\n\nDIS\t\n  \n\nSIDIS\t\n  \n\npp\t\n  (RHIC)\t\n  \n\nFigure 1: Parton-model Feynman diagrams for the processes constraining nucleon helicity structure.\n2\n\n\fthe desired information on the spin structure of the nucleon in terms of its universal parton densities,\nand parts that are short-distance and describe the hard interactions of the partons. The latter can be\nevaluated using perturbation theory, thanks to the asymptotic freedom of QCD. As an example, we\nconsider the reaction pp \u2192 \u03c0X, where the pion is produced at high transverse momentum pT , ensuring\nlarge momentum transfer. The statement of the factorization theorem [9] is then:\nX\nc\n(7)\nd\u2206\u03c3 =\n\u2297 Dc\u03c0\n\u2206fa \u2297 \u2206fb \u2297 d\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\na,b,c\n\nfor the polarized cross section, where \u2297 denotes a convolution. The Dc\u03c0 are the pion fragmentation\nc\nfunctions. The sum in Eq. (7) is over all contributing partonic channels a + b \u2192 c + X, with d\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\nthe associated spin-dependent partonic cross section. Factorization is valid up to corrections that are\nsuppressed as inverse powers of the hard scale. In general, a leading-order estimate of (7) merely captures\nthe main features, but does not usually provide a quantitative understanding. Only with knowledge of\nc\nthe next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the d\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\ncan one reliably extract information on\nthe parton distribution functions from the reaction. By now, NLO corrections are available for most of\nthe processes relevant in polarized high-energy scattering [10].\nIndependent information on the nucleon's helicity distributions may be obtained by using SU(2) and\nSU(3) flavor symmetries. The integrals of the flavor non-singlet combinations turn out to be proportional\nto the nucleon matrix elements of the quark non-singlet axial currents, hP, S | q\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03bbi q | P, Si. Such\ncurrents typically occur in weak interactions, and one may relate the matrix elements to the \u03b2-decay\nparameters F, D of the baryon octet. One finds\n\u2206\u03a3u \u2212 \u2206\u03a3d = F + D = 1.267,\n\u2206\u03a3u + \u2206\u03a3d \u2212 2\u2206\u03a3s = 3F \u2212 D \u2248 0.58 .\n\n(8)\n\nIf valid, the second relation when combined with Eq. (4) gives that \u2206\u03a3 = 0.58 + 3\u2206\u03a3s , so that a small\nquark spin contribution to the proton spin implies a large negative strange quark contribution. Fairly\nsignificant violations of SU(3) symmetry have been predicted based on heavy baryon chiral perturbation\ntheory [11]. Lattice investigations of this issue have begun but are not yet conclusive [12].\n\n2\n\nNucleon helicity structure: status 2009\n\nIn recent publications [13], we have presented the first next-to-leading order (NLO) \"global\" QCD\nanalysis of the nucleon's helicity distribution from DIS, semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS), and pp scattering\nat RHIC. We have used a Mellin moment method for the analysis. Our results are shown in Fig. 2,\nalong with estimates of their uncertainties. The shaded bands in Fig. 2 show the distributions that are\nallowed if one permits an overall increase of \u2206\u03c72 = 1 (green) or \u2206\u03c72 /\u03c72 = 2% (yellow). As one can\nsee, the \"total\" \u2206u + \u2206\u016b and \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304 helicity distributions are very well constrained. This is expected\nsince these distributions are primarily determined by the large body of inclusive DIS data. Our results\nagree well with the distributions obtained in previous and other recent analyses [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]\nwhich considered only the lepton scattering data.\nThe sea anti-quark distributions still carry rather large uncertainties, even though they are better\nconstrained now than in previous analyses, thanks to the advent of more precise SIDIS data and of a\nnew set of fragmentation functions [19] that describes the observables well in the unpolarized case. We\nfind that the sea appears not to be SU(2)-flavor symmetric: the \u2206\u016b distribution is mainly positive, while\nthe \u2206d \u0304 anti-quarks carry opposite polarization. This pattern has been predicted at least qualitatively\nby a number of models [14, 20]. Already based on the Pauli principle one would expect that if valence-u\nquarks primarily spin along the proton spin direction, u\u016b pairs in the sea will tend to have the u quark\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: Present status of the nucleon's NLO helicity distributions according to the global analysis\nof Ref. [13]. The solid center lines show the best-fit result. The shaded bands provide uncertainty\nestimates, using a criterion of \u2206\u03c72 = 1 (inner bands) or \u2206\u03c72 /\u03c72 = 2% (outer bands) as allowed\ntolerance on the \u03c72 value of the fit. Also shown are results from earlier analyses [14, 15] of nucleon spin\nstructure from lepton scattering data alone.\npolarized opposite to the proton. Hence, if such pairs are in a spin singlet, one expects \u2206\u016b > 0 and,\nby the same reasoning, \u2206d \u0304 < 0. We note that the uncertainties in SIDIS are still quite large, and it is\nin particular difficult to quantify the systematic uncertainty of the results related to the fragmentation\nmechanism at the relatively modest energies available.\nThe strange sea quark density shows a sign change. At moderately large x \u223c 0.1, it is constrained\nby the SIDIS data, which prefer a positive \u2206s. On the other hand, the inclusive DIS data combined\nwith the constraints from baryon \u03b2-decays demand a negative integral of \u2206s. As a consequence, \u2206s\nobtains its negative integral purely from the contribution from low-x. Interestingly, there are initial\nlattice determinations of the integral \u2206\u03a3s [12], which point to small values. It is clearly important to\nunderstand the strange contribution to nucleon spin structure better.\nConstraints on the spin-dependent gluon distribution \u2206g predominantly come from RHIC. As can\nbe seen from Fig. 2, the gluon distribution turns out to be small in the region of momentum fraction,\n2\n2\n0.05 . x . 0.2, accessible at RHIC, quite possibly having\nR 0.2a node. At Q = 10 GeV , the integral over\nthe mostly probed x-region is found to be almost zero, 0.05 dx\u2206g(x) = 0.005 \u00b1 0.06, where the error is\nobtained for a variation of \u03c72 by one unit. Thus, on the basis of [13], there are no indications of a sizable\ncontribution of gluon spins to the proton spin. We also note that a way to access \u2206g in lepton-nucleon\nscattering at HERMES and COMPASS is to measure final states that select the photon-gluon fusion\nprocess, heavy-flavor production and high-pT hadron or hadron-pair production [21, 22]. These data\nwere not included in the analysis [13], mostly because of the fact that success of the perturbative-QCD\nhard-scattering description had not been established for these observables in the kinematic regime of\n4\n\n\f0.8\n0.6\n\np,\u03c0+\n\nCOMPASS A1\n\np,K+\n\np,\u03c0-\n\nCOMPASS A1\n\nCOMPASS A1\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.6\n\np,K-\n\nCOMPASS A1\nDSSV\nDSSV+\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nx\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nx\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: COMPASS results [27] for SIDIS spin asymmetries on a proton target, compared to DSSV [13]\nand DSSV+ fits [29].\ninterest here. At least for single-inclusive high-pT hadrons in \u03b3p \u2192 h\u00b1 X it has now been found that\nQCD hard-scattering does appear to be applicable in the COMPASS kinematic regime [23, 24].\n\n3\n\nRecent developments\n\nInteresting new developments have taken place following the original DSSV analysis, mostly related to\nthe advent of new data. We will summarize these in the following.\n\n3.1\n\nRecent DIS and SIDIS data\n\nRecently, the COMPASS collaboration has published new DIS [25] and SIDIS [26, 27] data. The latter\nextend the coverage in x down to about x ' 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 , almost an order of magnitude lower than the\nkinematic reach of the HERMES data [28] used in the DSSV global analysis of 2008 [13]. For the first\ntime, the new results comprise measurements of identified pions and kaons taken with a longitudinally\npolarized proton target. Clearly, these data can have a significant impact on fits of helicity PDFs and\nestimates of their uncertainties. In particular, the new kaon data are expected to serve as an important\ncheck of the validity of the strangeness density obtained in the DSSV analysis discussed above, which\ninstead of favoring a negative polarization as in most fits based exclusively on DIS data, prefers a\nvanishing or perhaps even slightly positive \u2206s in the measured range of x.\nFigure 3 shows a detailed comparison [29] between the new proton SIDIS spin asymmetries from\nCOMPASS [26, 27] and the original DSSV fit (dashed lines). Also shown is the result of a re-analysis\nat NLO [29] accuracy (denoted as \"DSSV+\") based on the updated data set. The differences between\nthe DSSV and the DSSV+ fits are hard to notice, both for identified pions and kaons. The total \u03c72\n5\n\n\fFigure 4: \u03c72 profiles for the truncated first moment of \u2206s in two different x intervals, 0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 1\n(left) and 0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 0.02 (right).\n\nof the fit drops only by a few units upon refitting, which is not really a significant improvement for a\nPDF analysis in view of non-Gaussian theoretical uncertainties. The change in \u03c72 is also well within\nthe maximum \u2206\u03c72 /\u03c72 = 2% criterion adopted in the original DSSV global analysis [13]. Overall, upon\nrefitting, one finds a trend towards smaller net polarization for \u2206\u016b and \u2206d \u0304 in the range 0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 1\nthan in DSSV.\nAs we saw earlier, the original DSSV fit [13] found an interesting feature for the strangeness helicity\ndistribution: \u2206s was found to be small and slightly positive at medium-to-large x, but has a significantly\nnegative first moment in accordance with expectations based on SU(3) symmetry and fits to DIS data\nonly. To investigate this issue further, we present in Fig. 4 the \u03c72 profiles for two different intervals\nin x: 0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 1 (left) and 0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 0.02 (right). The profiles in Fig. 4 clearly show that the\nresult for \u2206s for 0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 0.02 is a compromise between DIS and SIDIS data, the latter favoring\nless negative values. Interestingly though, the new COMPASS SIDIS data, which extend towards the\nsmallest x values so far, actually show some preference for a slightly negative value for \u2206s as well.\nFor 0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 1 everything is determined by SIDIS data, and all sets consistently ask for a small,\nslightly positive strange quark polarization. There is no hint of a tension with DIS data here as they\ndo not provide a useful constraint at medium-to-large x. We note that at low x most SIDIS sets in the\noriginal DSSV fit give indifferent results. We also mention that in the range x > 0.001 the hyperon\ndecay constants, the so-called F and D values, do not play a significant role in constraining \u2206s(x).\nTo quantify possible SU(3) breaking effects one needs to probe \u2206s(x) at even smaller values of x, for\ninstance in SIDIS at a future EIC [30]. We finally note that the HERMES and COMPASS data are\nconsistent in the region of overlap, 0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 1.\nClearly, all current extractions of \u2206s from SIDIS data suffer from a significant dependence on kaon\nFFs, see, e.g., Refs. [26, 27], and better determinations of DK (z) are highly desirable. Contrary to other\nfits of FFs [32], only the DSS sets [19] provide a satisfactory description of pion and kaon multiplicities\nin the same kinematic range where we have polarized SIDIS data.\n6\n\n\f3.2\n\nW bosons at RHIC\n\nWe have seen in the previous section that the SIDIS data provide some insights into the flavor structure\nof the polarized sea distributions of the nucleon, albeit with still fairly large uncertainties. Complementary and clean information on \u2206u, \u2206\u016b, \u2206d, and \u2206d \u0304 will come from pp \u2192 W \u00b1 X at RHIC, where one\nexploits the maximally parity-violating couplings of the produced W bosons to left-handed quarks and\nright-handed anti-quarks [7, 33]. These give rise to a single-longitudinal spin asymmetry,\nAL \u2261\n\n\u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3\u2212\n,\n\u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212\n\n(9)\n\nfor the processes p~p \u2192 `\u00b1 X, where the arrow denotes a longitudinally polarized proton and ` = e or\n\u03bc is the charged decay lepton. The high scale set by the W boson mass makes it possible to extract\nquark and anti-quark polarizations from inclusive lepton single-spin asymmetries in W boson production\nwith minimal theoretical uncertainties, as higher order and sub-leading terms in the perturbative QCD\nexpansion are suppressed [34, 35, 36, 37].\nFor W \u2212 production, neglecting all partonic processes but the dominant \u016bd \u2192 W \u2212 one, the spindependent cross section in the numerator of the asymmetry is found to be proportional to the combination\n\u2206\u03c3 \u221d \u2206\u016b(x1 ) \u2297 d(x2 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)2 \u2212 \u2206d(x1 ) \u2297 \u016b(x2 )(1 + cos \u03b8)2 ,\n(10)\nwhere \u03b8 is the polar angle of the electron in the partonic c.m.s., with \u03b8 = 0 in the forward direction of\nthe polarized parton. At large negative pseudorapidity \u03b7lept of the charged lepton, one has x2 \u001d x1 and\n\u03b8 \u001d \u03c0/2. In this case, the first term in Eq. (10) strongly dominates, since the combination of parton\ndistributions, \u2206\u016b(x1 )d(x2 ), and the angular factor, (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)2 , each dominate over their counterpart\nin the second term. Since the denominator of AL is proportional to \u016b(x1 ) \u2297 d(x2 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)2 + d(x1 ) \u2297\n\u016b(x2 )(1 + cos \u03b8)2 , the asymmetry provides a clean probe of \u2206\u016b(x1 )/\u016b(x1 ) at medium values of x1 . By\nsimilar reasoning, at forward rapidity \u03b7lept \u001d 0 the second term in Eq. (10) dominates, giving access to\n\u2212\u2206d(x1 )/d(x1 ) at relatively high x1 .\nFor W + production, one has the following structure of the spin-dependent cross section:\n \u0304 1 ) \u2297 u(x2 )(1 + cos \u03b8)2 \u2212 \u2206u(x1 ) \u2297 d(x\n \u0304 2 )(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)2 .\n\u2206\u03c3 \u221d \u2206d(x\n\n(11)\n\nHere the distinction of the two contributions by considering large negative or positive lepton rapidities is\n \u0304 1 )u(x2 )\nless clear-cut than in the case of W \u2212 . For example, at negative \u03b7lept the partonic combination d(x\nwill dominate, but at the same time \u03b8 \u001d \u03c0/2 so that the angular factor (1 + cos \u03b8)2 is small. Likewise,\n \u0304 2 ) is suppressed by the angular factor.\nat positive \u03b7lept the dominant partonic combination \u2206u(x1 )d(x\nSo both terms in Eq. (11) will compete essentially for all \u03b7lept of interest. Our global analysis technique\nis of course suited for extracting information on the polarized PDFs even if there is no single dominant\npartonic subprocess. The NLO corrections to the single-inclusive lepton cross sections have recently\nbeen presented in [37] in a way tailored to use in the global analysis framework.\nFigure 5 shows the first published data from RHIC for AL in W \u00b1 production [38, 39]. For now, the\nstatistical uncertainties are still large. However, already now a large negative asymmetry is seen for the\ncase of W + production, resulting primarily from the positive up-quark polarization in the proton (see\nEq. (11)). Clearly, there is a large potential in future W -measurements at RHIC.\n\n3.3\n\nNew constraints on \u2206g\n\nThe STAR and PHENIX experiments at RHIC have recently presented new preliminary data from\nthe 2009 run for the double-helicity spin asymmetry ALL for jet and neutral-pion production, respectively [40, 41]. The results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. One can see that the experimental uncertainties\n7\n\n\fAL\n\n\u2192\n\np + p \u2192 W \u00b1 + X \u2192 e\u00b1 + X\nSTAR \u221a\u2212\ns = 500 GeV\n25 < E Te < 50 GeV\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\nW\u2212\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\nAL =\n\n0\n\n\u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3\u2212\n\u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212\n\nW \u2212 W + RHICBOS\nDNS-K\nDNS-KKP\nDSSV08\nCHE\nDSSV08\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\n\nW+\n\n\u22120.4\n\nSyst. uncertainty due to background,\nw/o pol. norm. uncertainty of 9.2%\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u03b7e\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 5: Published STAR [38] (top) and PHENIX [39] (bottom) data for the single-helicity asymmetry\nAL in W \u00b1 production at RHIC.\n\nare very significantly reduced as compared to those in the previous run-6 data sets [42, 43]. An interesting feature of the new preliminary STAR data is that they lie consistently above the result for the\nbest-fit DSSV distribution for jet transverse momenta below 25 GeV or so. They do remain well below\nthe old GRSV-\"standard\" result of [14], on the other hand. This suggests that the spin-dependent\ngluon distribution may be somewhat different from zero in the x-range where it is constrained by the\nRHIC data. The thick (magenta) solid line in the figure shows ALL obtained for a special set of parton distributions within the DSSV analysis. For this set the truncated moment of \u2206g over the region\n0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 1 was varied, allowing the total \u03c72 to change by 2%. Evidently, this set of parton distributions describes the STAR data rather well. The truncated moment of \u2206g in this set over the x-range\naccessed at RHIC is\nZ\n\n0.2\n\ndx \u2206g(x, Q2 = 10 GeV2 ) = 0.13 ,\n\n0.05\n\n8\n\n(12)\n\n\fFigure 6: Preliminary STAR run-9 data [40] for the double-helicity asymmetry ALL for single-inclusive\njet production, as a function of jet transverse momentum for |\u03b7| < 1. The preliminary run-6 data are\nshown as well. The theoretical curves are as described in the caption. The additional solid magenta\nline gives the result for a special DSSV set of polarized parton distributions, for which the truncated\nmoment of \u2206g over the region 0.001 \u2264 x \u2264 1 was varied allowing the total \u03c72 of the fit to change by\n2%.\nwhich is just within the range\nZ\n\n0.2\n\ndx \u2206g(x, Q2 = 10 GeV2 ) = 0.005+0.129\n\u22120.164\n\n(13)\n\n0.05\n\nquoted as more conservative uncertainty (\u2206\u03c72 /\u03c72 = 2%) in [13]. Despite the fact that this really is\nonly an illustration that cannot replace a proper re-analysis of the data, it does appears that, for the\nfirst time, there are indications of non-vanishing gluon polarization in the nucleon. Figure 7 shows the\ncomparison to the new preliminary PHENIX \u03c0 0 data [41]. Here the values of ALL are much smaller,\nwhich is mostly due to the fact that lower values of x are probed at the transverse momenta relevant in\nthe PHENIX measurements. One can see that the data are well described by both the DSSV set and\nthe special set of polarized parton distributions used in Fig. 6.\n\n4\n\nThe future: Electron Ion Collider (EIC)\n\nAn Electron Ion Collider is currently being considered in the U.S. as a new frontier facility to explore\nstrong-interaction phenomena [31]. One of its key features would be the availability of high-energy,\nhigh-luminosity polarized ep collisions to probe nucleon spin structure. This would also allow precision\nextractions of \u2206g, in particular from scaling violations of the proton's spin-dependent structure function\ng1 . Figure 8 shows the results of a recent dedicated phenomenological study [44]. \"Pseudo\" EIC-data\nwere generated for collisions of 5 GeV electrons with 50, 100, 250, and 325 GeV protons and were added\nto the DSSV global analysis code. The statistical precision of the data sets for 100 \u2212 325 GeV protons\nwas taken to correspond to about two months of running at the anticipated luminosities for eRHIC\nwith an assumed operations efficiency of 50%. For 5 \u00d7 50 GeV an integrated luminosity of 5 fb\u22121 was\n9\n\n\fDSSV\t\n  \n\nFigure 7: As in Fig. 6, but for the preliminary PHENIX run-9 data [41].\nassumed. The projected uncertainties were used to randomize the pseudo-data by one sigma around\ntheir central values determined by the DSSV set of PDFs. With these projected EIC data with their\nestimated uncertainties, a re-fit of the DSSV polarized parton distribution functions was performed.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 8. As one can see, with EIC data it should be possible to map the\ncurrently completely undetermined shape of \u2206g for 10\u22124 . x . 0.01 to an accuracy of about \u00b110% or\nbetter.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy (contract number DE-AC0298CH10886), and by CONICET, ANPCyT and UBACyT.\n\nReferences\n[1] For a recent review, see: M.
