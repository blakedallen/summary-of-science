Solid storage has the advantage of providing volumetric densities beyond what can be achieved with\ncompressed H2 gas or cryogenic liquid storage. However, all\nknown hydrides suffer from one or more of the following limitations: low gravimetric densities, high H-desorption temperatures, or an inability to be easily re-hydrided. The search\nfor new hydrides that overcome these limitations has attracted\nintense interest during the past 5 years.\nTowards these ends, recent experiments by Pinkerton and\nco-workers4,5,6 and Aoki et al.7,8 on the H-storage properties\nof the quaternary Li-B-N-H system are noteworthy. By mixing lithium borohydride (LiBH4 ) and lithium amide (LiNH2 ),\nboth groups have reported the formation of a new hydride\nphase, which when heated above \u223c520 K released approximately 10 wt.% hydrogen. While the reported desorption\ntemperature is somewhat too high, and reversibility has not\nyet been demonstrated, improvement in these areas may be\n\npossible (and has been partially demonstrated6) through the\naddition of catalytic dopants6,9 or via novel synthetic routes,10\nsuggesting that further study of this system is warranted.\nThe composition of the new Li-B-N-H phase was preliminarily identified4 as \"Li3 BN2 H8 ,\" but subsequent experiments\nbased on single crystal X-ray diffraction,11 and, synchrotron\nX-ray and neutron powder diffraction,12 identified its true stoichiometry as Li4 BN3 H10 . Combined, these diffraction experiments identified three similar crystal structures, all sharing the\nbcc space group I21 3 with lattice constant a = 10.66\u201310.68 \u00c5,\nbut with somewhat different internal coordinates. The discrepancy in atomic positions results in N-H bond lengths that\ndiffer between structures by as much as 0.2 \u00c5, with smaller\nN-H lengths reported for the X-ray structures. It has been\nsuggested that the discrepancy may be an artifact of X-ray interactions with strongly polarized electron clouds along the\nN-H bond direction.11\nA careful characterization of a hydride's crystal structure is desirable because it enables an independent, ab initio assessment of the thermodynamics of hydrogen desorption/absorption reactions. Such an assessment is of value\nbecause it can clarify the thermodynamics when calorimetry\nmeasurements yield ambiguous results, such as in situations\nwhere multiple reactions occur simultaneously (see below). A\nkey thermodynamic property which determines the suitability of a hydride for H-storage applications is the strength of\nthe hydrogen-host bond. The bond strength is quantified via\nthe change in enthalpy (\u2206H) occurring during hydrogen uptake/release. In mobile FC applications, for example, it is desirable that the desorption reaction be endothermic (\u2206H > 0)\nwith \u2206H \u2248 20\u201350 kJ/(mol H2 ). Neglecting kinetics, an enthalpy in this range would allow for H-desorption at temper-\n\n\f2\natures compatible with the waste heat from a FC, and permit\non-board recharging under reasonable H2 pressure.\n\nUnfortunately, calorimetric measurements of H-desorption\nin Li4 BN3 H10 have been difficult to interpret. (See Refs. 6 and\n8, and the supplementary information accompanying Ref. 4.)\nBecause Li4 BN3 H10 melts at \u223c460 K, approximately 60 degrees below the onset of H-desorption, hydrogen gas evolves\nfrom the liquid state.4 Concurrent with H2 release is the formation of a solid reaction product, generally involving one\nor more polymorphs of Li3 BN2 along with other unidentified\nphases,4,7,8 and desorption of 2-3 mol % ammonia.4 Measurements based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)4,6 and\ndifferential thermal analysis (DTA)8 suggest that the net heat\nflow during dehydriding is exothermic (\u2206H < 0). However,\nit is unclear what fraction of the total thermal profile arises\nfrom the exothermic latent heat of Li3 BN2 solidification,8 and\nfurthermore how H2 and NH3 release impacts the calorimeter response.4 Consequently, it has not been possible to unambiguously assess the endo- or exothermic nature of Hdesorption alone. Neglecting kinetic effects, the fact that it\nhas proven very difficult4 to re-hydride Li4 BN3 H10 suggests\ndesorption is weakly endothermic, or exothermic. Regarding Li4 BN3 H10 formation, several studies4,8,12 have reported\nthe spontaneous formation of Li4 BN3 H10 after mixing LiBH4\nwith LiNH2 , even at temperatures as low as room temperature,\nsuggesting that the formation reaction is exothermic.4\n\nIn light of the discrepancy noted above regarding the crystal structure of Li4 BN3 H10 , and the additional ambiguity surrounding its dehydrogenation thermodynamics, we employ\ndensity functional theory (DFT)13,14 calculations in an attempt\nto clarify these issues. First, we determine the ground state\ncrystal structure by performing separate geometry optimization calculations on each of the experimentally proposed crystal structures. We find that the relaxed structures are essentially identical, and have N-H bond lengths that are consistent\nwith the structure based on neutron diffraction,12 thus confirming the conjecture11 that the anomalously short N-H bond\nlengths observed in Ref. 11 are an artifact of X-ray measurements. Second, we evaluate the finite-temperature reaction\nenthalpies and free energies for the formation and dehydrogenation of Li4 BN3 H10 . Li4 BN3 H10 formation (with respect\nto LiNH2 and LiBH4 ) is found to be exothermic, in agreement with experimental reports of spontaneous Li4 BN3 H10\nformation in the literature.4,7,12 For H2 -desorption we explore the thermodynamics of seventeen candidate reactions\nover the temperature range T = 0\u20131000 K, as there appears\nto be some uncertainty in determining the reaction products\nexperimentally.4,7 At temperatures where desorption has been\nreported4 (T \u2248 520-630 K), the favored reaction is predicted\nto be Li4 BN3 H10 \u2192 Li3 BN2 + LiNH2 + 4 H2 , which is weakly\nendothermic. Moreover, the calculated free energies suggest\nLi4 BN3 H10 is a metastable phase that should decompose via\none of three temperature-dependent pathways.\n\nII. METHODOLOGY\n\nFirst-principles calculations were performed using a\nplanewave method based on the PW91 generalized gradient\napproximation15 to density functional theory13,14 (VASP).16\nThe core-valence electron interaction was treated using\nBl\u00f6chl's projector augmented wave (PAW) method,17,18 and kpoint sampling was performed on a dense Monkhorst-Pack19\ngrid with an energy convergence of better than 1 meV per supercell. (In the case of Li4 BN3 H10 , a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 grid was\nsufficient to acheive this level of precision.) Electronic occupancies were determined via a gaussian smearing algorithm\nwith a 0.1 eV smearing width. For high-precision calculation of static zero Kelvin (omitting zero point vibrational effects) electronic energies and crystal structures we used the\nso-called \"hard\" VASP PAW potentials51 with a planewave cutoff of 875 eV, and a geometry relaxation tolerance of better\nthan 0.02 eV/\u00c5. Internal atomic positions and external cell\nshape/volume were optimized simultaneously.\nFinite-temperature thermodynamics were evaluated within\nthe harmonic approximation.20,21 Vibrational frequencies (\u03c9i )\nwere extracted by diagonalizing a dynamical matrix whose elements were determined via the so-called direct method:22 the\nforces generated by series of symmetry inequivalent atomic\ndisplacements about the equilibrium geometry (\u00b10.02 \u00c5,\n\u00b10.04 \u00c5) were fit to cubic splines in order to extract the\nforce constants. Because large supercells are desirable to minimize finite-size effects, and with the exception of the molecular species (H2 , N2 , NH3 ) where the number of atoms per\nsupercell is small, the dynamical matrix calculations on the\nsolid-state phases were preformed using a softer set of PAW\npotentials52 and planewave cutoff energies ranging from 400\u2013\n500 eV.53 A comparison of calculated structural parameters\nand formation energies with existing experimental and theoretical data is presented in the following section.\nOnce the normal-mode frequencies have been determined,\nfinite-temperature energetics can be obtained by enthalpic\n(Hvib ) and entropic (Svib ) additions to the static electronic energies.

Both domains exhibited a bcc structure (space\ngroup I21 3) with lattice constants of 10.67-10.68 \u00c5. Chater et\nal.12 used a combination of high-resolution synchrotron X-ray\nand neutron diffraction to examine powder samples prepared\nfrom a wide range of LiNH2 :LiBH4 compositions. They determined that although the most likely stoichiometric composition was 3:1, the Li4 BN3 H10 structure was able to accommodate a wide range of stoichiometries. Their best-fit crystal\nstructure had external cell parameters similar to those reported\nin Ref. 11: bcc (space group I21 3) with a = 10.66 \u00c5. Despite\nthe good agreement in external geometries, the structures obtained by these two studies differ markedly in their internal\ncoordinates. Most notably, the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study11 found anomalously short N-H bond lengths of\n0.83-0.86 \u00c5, while neutron scattering12 gave lengths of 0.981.04 \u00c5.\nThe external cell parameters obtained upon relaxing each\nof the three Li4 BN3 H10 experimental structures (as well as the\nstructures of the other phases used in our subsequent discussion of reaction thermodynamics) are summarized in Table I.\nThe resulting structures are bcc and share the same lattice constant, a = 10.60 \u00c5, in good agreement with both diffraction\nstudies.\nFor each of the three relaxed structures, Table II compares the calculated internal atomic coordinates with the corresponding experimental values. We note first that the average absolute deviation (\u03b4) between theory and experiment is\nsmallest for the neutron structure,12 \u03b4 = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 , whereas\nfor the X-ray structure11 \u03b4 = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u03b4 = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123\nfor domains 1 and 2, respectively. The largest discrepancy\nbetween theory and experiment is in the positions of the Nbonded hydrogen atoms, H1 & H2, in the X-ray structure.\n(Note that the labeling convention for hydrogens is different\nin the neutron structure: there H1 & H2 refer to B-bonded hydrogens.) Secondly, while there appear to be large differences\nin the internal coordinates measured by Refs. 11 and 12 (Table II), after relaxation these three structures may be mapped\nonto one another via a series of rigid body rotations and translations. We conclude that all three experimental structures relax to essentially the same structure.\n\nBN (F 4\u03043m)\nLi (Im3\u0304m)\nLiH (F m3\u0304m)\nLi3 N (P 3\u0304m1)\nLiNH2 (I 4\u0304)\nLi2 NH (P nma)\n\n\u03b1-Li3 BN2 (P 42 /mnm)\n\u03b2-Li3 BN2 (P 21 /c)\n\nLi3 BN2 (I41 /amd)\nLiBH4 (P nma)\n\nLi4 BN3 H10 (I21 3)\n\nParameter\nd(H-H)\nd(N-N)\nd(N-H)\n\u2221(H-N-H)\na\n\u03b1\na\na\na\na\nc\na\nc\na\nb\nc\na\nc\na\nb\nc\n\u03b2\na\nc\na\nb\nc\na\n\nCalculated\n0.749\n1.101\n1.021\n106.4\n5.05\n58.1\n3.62\n3.44\n4.01\n3.64\n3.88\n5.02\n10.28\n7.75\n3.61\n4.88\n4.67\n5.22\n5.15\n7.08\n6.77\n112.7\n6.63\n10.35\n7.25\n4.38\n6.63\n10.60\n\nExperiment\n0.74124\n1.09824\n1.01224\n106.724\n5.0625\n58.125\n3.6226\n3.5127\n4.0728\n3.61a\n3.85a\n5.0429\n10.2829\n7.73b\n3.60b\n4.87b\n4.6430,31\n5.2630,31\n5.1532\n7.0832\n6.7932\n113.032\n6.6033\n10.3533\n7.1834\n4.4434\n6.8034\n10.67-10.6811\n10.6612\n\na Theoretically predicted structure from Ref. 35. In agreement with Ref. 35,\nwe find the room-temperature experimental P 6/mmm structure to be unstable at low temperature, with a weak soft mode of 66i cm\u22121 .\nb Theoretically predicted structure from Ref. 36.\n\nA comparison of calculated bond lengths, bond angles, and\nintermolecular distances is given in Table III. Overall, the\nrelaxed structures agree best with the intramolecular lengths\n(i.e., within an NH2 or BH4 fragment) determined using neutron diffraction; conversely, the intermolecular distances from\nX-ray are closest to those in the relaxed theoretical structures.\nAs for the intramolecular structure, as noted above, the major\ndiscrepancy between the experimental structures lies in the\ntwo N-H bond lengths, d(N-H), in the NH2 fragment. The\ncalculated length of 1.027 \u00c5 is in better agreement with the\nlonger bond lengths predicted by neutron diffraction of 0.983\nand 1.042 \u00c5. Similarly, the X-ray data also underestimates\nB-H bond lengths in the BH4 units relative to our DFT calculations and neutron data. Calculated bond angles agree best\nwith those from the neutron structure.\n\n\f4\nTABLE II: Calculated relaxed internal atomic positions of Li4 BN3 H10 compared with experimental measurements from Refs. 11,12.\nAtom\nN\nB\nLi1\nLi2\nLi3\nH1\nH2\nH3\nH4\nN\nB\nLi1\nLi2\nLi3\nH1\nH2\nH3\nH4\nN\nB\nLi1\nLi2\nLi3\nH1\nH2\nH3\nH4\n\nx\n0.117\n0.113\n0.281\n0.519\n0.484\n0.195\n0.118\n0.003\n0.180\n0.117\n0.113\n0.281\n0.519\n0.484\n0.195\n0.118\n0.003\n0.180\n-0.152\n0.137\n0.250\n-0.268\n0.266\n0.071\n0.103\n-0.143\n-0.071\n\nCalculated\ny\n0.362\n0.113\n0.000\n0.000\n0.484\n0.306\n0.415\n0.118\n0.180\n0.361\n0.113\n0.000\n0.000\n0.484\n0.305\n0.415\n0.117\n0.180\n0.112\n0.137\n-0.030\n0.000\n0.266\n0.071\n0.133\n0.055\n0.165\n\nz\n0.402\n0.113\n0.250\n0.250\n0.484\n0.393\n0.321\n0.147\n0.180\n0.402\n0.113\n0.250\n0.250\n0.484\n0.394\n0.321\n0.148\n0.180\n0.367\n0.137\n0.000\n0.250\n0.266\n0.071\n0.247\n0.445\n0.368\n\nx\n0.115\n0.114\n0.287\n0.524\n0.483\n0.175\n0.115\n0.012\n0.172\n0.115\n0.114\n0.286\n0.523\n0.484\n0.176\n0.114\n0.015\n0.174\n-0.156\n0.135\n0.250\n-0.262\n0.272\n0.072\n0.097\n-0.153\n-0.077\n\nExperiment\ny\n0.359\n0.114\n0.000\n0.000\n0.483\n0.310\n0.405\n0.119\n0.172\n0.359\n0.114\n0.000\n0.000\n0.484\n0.310\n0.402\n0.116\n0.174\n0.110\n0.135\n-0.043\n0.000\n0.272\n0.072\n0.136\n0.053\n0.167\n\nz\n0.405\n0.114\n0.250\n0.250\n0.483\n0.397\n0.339\n0.146\n0.172\n0.405\n0.114\n0.250\n0.250\n0.484\n0.399\n0.338\n0.149\n0.174\n0.367\n0.135\n0.000\n0.250\n0.272\n0.072\n0.248\n0.439\n0.377\n\nDomain 1,\nRef. 11\n\nDomain 2,\nRef. 11\n\nRef. 12\n\nTABLE III: Comparison of calculated atomic distances and angles with values determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Ref. 11) and\nsynchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction (Ref. 12).

All three of these phases have been observed as dehydrogenation products for Li4 BN3 H10 ,4,8 and we\nhave performed calculations on each phase to determine its\nrelative stability as a function of temperature. The \u03b2-Li3 BN2\nphase was found to have the lowest zero-Kelvin static energy, \u2248 2 kJ/(mol f.u.) lower than that of either the bct or\n\u03b1 phases. The latter two phases are degenerate in energy to\nwithin 0.1 kJ/(mol f.u.). Our zero-Kelvin energetics and structures agree well with recent calculations reported by Pinkerton\nand Herbst.33\nVibrational contributions to the energies of each Li3 BN2\npolymorph were evaluated within the harmonic approximation. For \u03b1-Li3 BN2 a careful evaluation of the vibrational spectra yielded doubly-degenerate imaginary modes at\n81i cm\u22121 , indicating that this phase is unstable at low temperatures. A search for alternative low-energy \u03b1-Li3 BN2 structures was performed using molecular dynamics (md) on an enlarged (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2) \u03b1-Li3 BN2 supercell at T = 423 K for 10 ps.\nAt 1 ps intervals the current md configuration was stored, relaxed, and the symmetry of the resulting optimized structure\nwas determined. Four unique crystal structures were identified, with space groups (numbers): P 21 21 21 (19), P ccn (56),\nP mmn (59), and P nma (62). These structures were then\nrelaxed within their symmetry constraints, and were found\nto have energies \u223c1 kJ/(mol f.u.) lower than the original\n\u03b1-Li3 BN2 structure [which is still 1 kJ/(mol f.u.) higher in\nenergy than \u03b2-Li3 BN2 ]. In light of these results we suggest\nthat the crystal structure of \u03b1-Li3 BN2 be experimentally reassessed, and we exclude this phase from our evaluation of\nLi4 BN3 H10 dehydrogenation reactions. Further information\nregarding our proposed structure of \u03b1-Li3 BN2 can be found\nelsewhere.39\nUnlike \u03b1-Li3 BN2 , no imaginary modes were observed in\nthe vibrational spectra of \u03b2 or bct Li3 BN2 .

Consequently, the small \u223c2 kJ/(mol f.u.) difference in static energies noted above is sufficient to favor the monoclinic \u03b2 phase\nas the ground state structure, and the bct-\u03b2 energy difference\nremains roughly constant for T < 1000 K. Based on the vibrational instability observed in \u03b1-Li3 BN2 , and the higher free\nenergy of bct Li3 BN2 (relative to \u03b2-Li3 BN2 ), our subsequent\nthermodynamic analyses are performed assuming Li3 BN2 resides in the the low-energy \u03b2 structure.\nThe zero-point, enthalpic, and entropic contributions to the\nfree energy of the various phases are summarized in Table IV.\nAs a further test of our computational methodology, there we\nalso compare our calculated ZPE to other values reported in\nthe literature, and find good agreement. With the exception of\nLi, vibrational effects are found to contribute substantially to\nthe free energies of these systems. For example, in Li4 BN3 H10\nthe ZPE exceeds 300 kJ/mol.\nA comparison of formation energies for the compounds\nused in this study (relative to the elements in their standard\nstates) is presented in Table V. Three reports33,41,42 based on\nDFT calculations have also recently evaluated formation energies for some of these compounds, and the present calculations are in good agreement with their findings. Furthermore, the agreement with experimental enthalpies is reasonable (generally on the order of 10%), which is representative of the accuracy obtained via density functional methods\nfor reactions involving molecular species.47 As expected, the\nlargest percentage discrepancy is for the ammonia molecule.54\nTwo general trends in the data are evident: (i) With the exception of ammonia, the DFT enthalpies (\u2206H T=300K ) are more\npositive than the experimental values, and (ii) the inclusion of\ndynamical contributions (\u2206E \u2192 \u2206H T=300K ) results in more\n\n\f6\nTABLE V: Comparison of calculated formation energies (with respect to the elements, in kJ/mol f.u.) with existing experimental and\ntheoretical data. \u2206E refers to differences in static 0 K energies, formation enthalpies (\u2206H) and free energies (\u2206G) are based on Eqns. 3\nand 4, respectively.

Reaction (a) considers formation from\nthe elemental phases in their standard states, and reaction (b) corresponds to the synthesis route employed in the\nliterature4,7,12 involving a mixture of LiNH2 and LiBH4 . (We\nconsider only the stoichiometric12 3:1 ratio of LiNH2 to\nLiBH4 .55 ) The energetics of each reaction are are decomposed\ninto a sequence having increasingly more physical contributions to the reaction thermodynamics, \u2206E \u2192 \u2206H T=0K \u2192\n\u2206H T=300K \u2192 \u2206GT=300K , which allows us to gauge the importance of these contributions in comparison to the common\npractice of evaluating only static zero-Kelvin energetics. [\u2206E\nrefers to differences in the static zero-Kelvin energies (E in\nEq. 3), and \u2206H T=0 K adds ZPE contributions to \u2206E.] Both\nformation reactions in Table VI are predicted to be exothermic (\u2206H < 0), in agreement with reports of spontaneous\nLi4 BN3 H10 formation from the literature.4,7,12 As expected,\nformation from the elements vs. from the hydride mixture is a\nsubstantially more exothermic process.\nIt is noteworthy that dynamical contributions to the reaction\nenergies are significant in reaction (a) (\u2206E 6= \u2206H), but appear to play a minor role in reaction (b) (\u2206E \u2248 \u2206H). By examining the values presented in Table IV for the phases participating in reaction (b) (Li4 BN3 H10 , LiNH2 , & LiBH4 ) we see\nthat these terms are sizable, but that they largely cancel out.\nThis cancellation effect can be understood by the similarities\nin internal bonding shared by these three phases: Li4 BN3 H10 ,\n\u2212\nwith its Li+ , BH\u2212\n4 , and NH2 ions is essentially an amalgam\n\nof the structures present in LiNH2 and LiBH4 .\nTurning now to the dehydrogenation of Li4 BN3 H10 , we\nnote first that although several dehydrogenation products have\nbeen observed in experimental studies,4,5,7,8 the precise identity and respective proportions of these phases have not yet\nbeen definitively determined.4,7 For example, Aoki et al. reported unidentified diffraction peaks after dehydrogenation at\n2\u03b8 = 25\u25e6 and 35\u25e6 . A technique for predicting possible decomposition pathways would be of significant value in helping to understand these reactions. However, decomposition\npathways and products are difficult to predict a priori. To\nthis end, we have scanned through the thermodynamics of a\nlarge number of candidate dehydrogenation reactions over a\nwide temperature range in order to identify the energetically\nfavored products.55\nCalculated thermodynamics for seventeen candidate\nLi4 BN3 H10 dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table VII.\nIn addition to the room-temperature energetics, there we also\npresent data for T = 460 K, which is slightly below the\nmelting point of pure Li4 BN3 H10 . Unlike the Li4 BN3 H10\nformation reaction, which can proceed at room temperature,4\ndehydrogenation of Li4 BN3 H10 has been reported only at\nelevated temperatures. In the case of pure Li4 BN3 H10 , dehydrogenation occurs above \u223c520 K, about 60 degrees above\nthe melting temperature.4 However, a significant reduction in\ndehydrogenation temperature was observed upon the addition\nof a small amount of a Pt/Vulcan carbon catalyst.6 In this\nlatter case hydrogen release occurred from the solid phase at\nT > 390 K. To more completely assess the dehydrogenation\nthermodynamics over a range of relevant temperatures, in\nFig. 2 we plot the enthalpies and free energies of the candidate\nreactions for T = 0\u20131000 K.\nOut of the seventeen reactions considered, three\nreactions-(i), (c), and (f)-emerge as the most-favorable\nreactions in distinct temperature regimes (see Fig. 2,\nbottom panel). For low temperatures reaction (i) is preferred, followed at increasing temperatures by reaction (c)\nand reaction (f). More specifically, the favored products\nand their respective temperature ranges of stability are:\n0 K \u2264T\u2264 300 K: 2LiNH2 + 2LiH + BN + 2H2\n300 K \u2264T\u2264 700 K:\nLi3 BN2 + LiNH2 + 4H2\n700 K \u2264T:\nLi3 BN2 + LiH + 21 N2 + 29 H2\nThe relatively large entropy of the gas phase products plays\nan important role in determining which reaction is favored at\na given temperature. Reactions yielding greater quantities of\ngaseous products should be favored with increasing T , and\nthis is consistent with the observed trend: reaction (i), 2 mols\n\u2192 reaction (c), 4 mols \u2192 reaction (f), 5 mols. (It should be\nnoted that at high temperatures-and certainly above the melting point of Li4 BN3 H10 -the harmonic approximation will no\nlonger be valid, so we expect some decrease in accuracy with\nincreasing T .)\nOf the three favorable dehydrogenation reactions, only reaction (c), Li4 BN3 H10 \u2192 Li3 BN2 + LiNH2 + 4H2 , takes place\nwithin the temperature range where H2 -desorption (from undoped Li4 BN3 H10 ) has been experimentally observed (T \u223c\n520\u2013630 K). While our prediction of Li3 BN2 as a dehydrogenation product is consistent with experimental observa-\n\n\f7\nTABLE VI: Formation energies of Li4 BN3 H10 [in kJ/(mol Li4 BN3 H10 )]. \u2206E corresponds to the static zero Kelvin DFT energies; \u2206H T = 0K\nadds the zero point energies to \u2206E; \u2206H T= 300K (Eq. 3) adds finite-temperature vibrational (and molecular rotational+translational+pV ) energies to \u2206H T=0K ; \u2206GT=300K (Eq. 4) includes all of the contributions to \u2206H T=300K and adds vibrational (solids) or tabulated (molecular)\nentropies.\nRxn.

The\nreactions are labeled as in Table VII.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy for reaction (c) ranges from 11.2\nto 12.8 kJ/(mol H2 ) for T = 300\u2013500 K, indicating that H2\nrelease is a weakly endothermic process. For the highertemperature reaction (f), dehydrogenation is likewise predicted to be endothermic with a slightly larger enthalpy of\n\u223c31 kJ/(mol H2 ). Only the low temperature reaction (i)\nwith \u2206H \u2248 \u2212(16\u201319) kJ/(mol H2 ) is found to be exothermic. It would be interesting to test whether the predicted\ntemperature-dependent decomposition sequence [(i) \u2192 (c) \u2192\n(f)] could be observed experimentally by holding Li4 BN3 H10\nat temperatures within each of the reaction regimes for long\ntimes.\nBased on the data presented in Fig. 2 and Table VII, H2 desorption from Li4 BN3 H10 is thermodynamically favorable at\nessentially all non-zero temperatures: the negative free energies of dehydrogenation suggest that Li4 BN3 H10 is metastable\nwith respect to decomposition via one of the reactions (i), (c),\nor (f). On the other hand, experiments4 on pure Li4 BN3 H10\nindicate that desorption does not take place until the tempera-\n\n\f8\nture is raised above 520 K. Taken together, these factors suggest that the relatively high temperatures needed in practice\nfor H2 -release are a consequence of poor kinetics, not unfavorable thermodynamics.\nAn important distinction between our calculations and the\nexperimental dehydrogenation of undoped Li4 BN3 H10 concerns the phase of Li4 BN3 H10 present during the dehydrogenation reaction. As mentioned above, pure Li4 BN3 H10 releases hydrogen from the molten state.4 Similarly, H2 release\nfrom other hydride phases, such as LiBH4 , also occurs from\nthe molten state.48 Due to the computational expense associated with obtaining precise energetics for liquids using DFT,\nthis study, and previous studies on LiBH4 ,41,48 have modeled\nthe dehydrogenation reaction as a solid-state reaction. Since\nthe enthalpy of the liquid phase will be more positive than\nthat of the corresponding solid phase, the calculated solidstate enthalpy of reaction (c) evaluated at the melting point\n(Tmp ), \u2206H Tmp = 12.5 kJ/(mol H2 ), represents an upper bound\non the enthalpy for desorption from liquid Li4 BN3 H10 . It\nwill be possible to more precisely estimate the magnitude by\nwhich \u2206H is overestimated once the latent heat of melting\nfor Li4 BN3 H10 has been measured. Until such data become\navailable, it nevertheless seems reasonable to conclude that\nthe dehydrogenation of Li4 BN3 H10 is either weakly endothermic, or exothermic. This conclusion is consistent with the\nfailed attempts at re-hydriding Li4 BN3 H10 reported thus far\nin the literature,4 as a small (positive) enthalpy of dehydrogenation will result in a similarly small thermodynamic driving force for re-hydriding. On the other hand, for Li4 BN3 H10\ndoped with Pt/Vulcan carbon,6 dehydrogenation begins below\nTmp . In this case our approach of modeling solid state reactions more accurately captures the true phase behavior of\nLi4 BN3 H10 , neglecting the possible formation of C- or Ptcontaining compounds.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nDensity functional theory calculations have been employed\nto study the crystal structure and the finite-temperature formation and dehydrogenation thermodynamics of Li4 BN3 H10 .\nThe calculations have resolved the discrepancies in hydrogen\nbond lengths between the separate structures determined via\nX-ray and neutron diffraction experiments, and suggest that\nthe neutron data yields a slightly more accurate description of\nthe crystal structure. All three of the reported experimental\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\ncrystal structures relax to essentially the same structure.\nFor reaction energetics, our calculations indicate that\nLi4 BN3 H10 formation is exothermic, and that the dehydrogenation enthalpy of solid-state Li4 BN3 H10 is temperaturedependent: H2 release is exothermic at low temperatures, and\nweakly endothermic at the higher temperatures probed by recent experiments. A non-zero latent heat for Li4 BN3 H10 melting will reduce the dehydrogenation enthalpy from the liquid\nstate (relative to the solid state), but the size of this effect\nis still to be determined. To help clarify the identity of the\nphases produced via dehydrogenation we have performed a\ncomputational search over 17 candidate dehydrogenation reactions, and identified three reactions having favorable thermodynamics spanning the temperature range T = 0\u20131000 K.\nAll three of these reactions exhibit a decrease in free energy,\nsuggesting that Li4 BN3 H10 is a metastable phase. For temperatures where H2 -desorption has been experimentally observed, the thermodynamically-favored reaction is Li4 BN3 H10\n\u2192 Li3 BN2 + LiNH2 + 4H2 , with an enthalpy of 11.2\u201312.8\nkJ/(mol H2 ). The relatively small dehydriding enthalpies are\nconsistent with the failed re-hydriding attempts reported in the\nliterature, and suggest that hydrogen release from Li4 BN3 H10\nis a kinetically-rather than thermodynamically-hindered\nprocess.\nNote added in proof -During the review of this manuscript\ntwo new studies of Li4 BN3 H10 were brought to our\nattention.49,50 In the first study Noritake and co-workers50 performed a crystal structure analysis of Li4 BN3 H10 using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. While they found external structural parameters (bcc, space group I21 3, a = 10.67 \u00c5) consistent with the two reports cited previously,11,12 the reported\nN\u2013H bond lengths were more consistent with the neutron data\nof Ref. 12 (and with our calculated N\u2013H distances) than the\nX-ray data of Ref. 11. In the other recent study, Herbst and\nHector49 examined the electronic structure and energetics of\nof Li4 BN3 H10 using DFT. Our results appear to be consistent\nwith their findings.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank D. Halliday, A. Sudik, and J. Yang for\nreviewing a preliminary version of this manuscript. V.

Second, our\ncalculated formation energies for LiH, LiNH2 , and Li2 NH at\nT = 300 K agree with the hard PAW results in Ref. 42 to\nwithin 1 kJ/mol f.u. Third, testing revealed that the hard potentials\nyielded molecular vibrational frequencies which were in slightly\nbetter agreement with experimental data than those obtained with\nthe softer PAW set. For example, for N2 , where the differences between calculated vibrational frequencies are largest, we find 2338\n(2452) cm\u22121 from the hard (soft) PAW sets, compared with an\nexperimental value of 2359 cm\u22121 .24 However, this slight discrepancy in frequencies has only a small impact on vibrational thermodynamic properties-for example, ZPEs calculated with both\nPAW sets differ by 0.7 kJ/mol f.u. at most. It therefore seems\nlikely that an approach where all vibrational properties (solids and\nmolecules) were evaluated using the softer potentials would also\nyield reasonably precise results. We thus conclude that our approach of mixing potentials gives results comparable in precision\nto those obtained with the hard PAW set alone, but without the\nassociated computational expense.\nThe discrepancy in calculated vs. experimental enthalpy for\nLi2 NH has been noted in Ref. 42, and it has been suggested that\nthe experimental measurement be revisited in light of the good\nagreement for the other Li-containing compounds: LiH, LiNH2 ,\nand LiBH4 . To our knowledge the formation enthalpy of Li2 NH\nreported in Ref. 46 has not been independently confirmed.\nDue to the computational difficulty associated with treating a\nnon-stoichiometric phase, our calculations are restricted to the\nstoichiometric composition \"Li4 BN3 H10 ,\" whereas most experiments have focused on 2:1 LiNH2 :LiBH4 off-stoichiometric\n\"Li3 BN2 H8 \" mixtures, which have been found to minimize5 NH3\nrelease.\n\n\f"}
