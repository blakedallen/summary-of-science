This material undergoes a sharp metal-insulator transition at 230 K.

In the metallic phase, Drude components in low frequencies and an interband\ntransition peak at \u223c 2eV are observed.

Our\nexperiments indicate that the band structure is reconstructed in the insulating phase due to the\nsudden structural transition.\nPACS numbers: 72.80.Ga, 78.20.Ci, 71.30.+h, 78.30.-j\n\nSpinel type compound CuIr2 S4 has recently attracted much attention for its intriguing first-order\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) at TMI \u223c 230\nK1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 . The transition is characterized by a sudden increase of the electrical resistivity,\na disappearance of Pauli paramagnetism, a hysteresis\nloop in resistivity \u03c1 and magnetic susceptibility \u03c7, and\na lowering of structure symmetry. Above the MIT\ntemperature, CuIr2 S4 has a normal cubic spinel structure, in which the Cu ions (A sites) are tetrahedrally\ncoordinated and the Ir ions (B sites) are octahedrally\ncoordinated by sulfur ions. Upon entering the low\ntemperature insulating phase, a structural deformation\noccurs, lowering the lattice symmetry to triclinic11 .\nThe structure and the MIT in CuIr2 S4 is reminiscent\nof a classic spinel compound\u2013the magnetite Fe3 O4 , which\nalso exhibits an abrupt MIT at about 120 K, called the\nVerway transition16 . The Fe3 O4 undergoes a ferrimagnetic transition at a much higher temperature (858 K).\nBelow this temperature, the magnetic moments of the Fe\nions are ferrimagnetically ordered, but the A sites [Fe3+\n(t32g e2g , s=5/2)] and B sites [Fe2+ (t42g e2g , s=2) and Fe3+\n(s=5/2)] have opposite spin directions. The Verway transition has been interpreted as a charge ordering transition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ on the B sites in alternate (001)\nplanes17 .\nNaturally, it is considered that the MIT in CuIr2 S4 is\nsimilar to the Verway transition in Fe3 O4 . Since the band\nstructure calculation and the photoemission experiments\nrevealed that the valence state of Cu is Cu1+3,4 , it is believed that the ionic configuration of Cu1+ Ir3+ Ir4+ S2\u2212\n4 is\nrealized in the low-T insulating phase, and the ordering\nof Ir3+ and Ir4+ ions is a plausible origin of the MIT4,10 .\nIndeed, recent high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder\ndiffraction experiment revealed a peculiar form of charge\nordering which consists of alternating arrangement of iso-\n\n4+\nmorphic octamers or clusters of Ir3+\n8 S24 and Ir8 S24 (as\nisovalent bi-capped hexagonal rings) together with spindimerizations between Ir4+ ions11 . The charge-ordering\npattern is much more complicated than Fe3 O4 as well\nas any other previously known charge-ordered structures\nwhich are typically based on stripes, slabs or chequerboard patterns. The simultaneous charge-ordering and\nspin-dimerization transition is a rare phenomenon in\nthree-dimensional compounds11 . Therefore, it is very interesting to further explore how the electronic structures\nchange in the MIT. This work presents a detailed infrared\nspectroscopy study on single crystal samples. It provides\nimportant information about low-lying excitations across\nthe transition.\n\nSingle crystals of CuIr2 S4 were grown from the bismuth\nsolution18 . First, single phase CuIr2 S4 powders were synthesized by solid-state reaction in sealed quartz tube using high purity (better than 4N) powders of elements\nCu, Ir, and S as starting materials. Then, CuIr2 S4 and\nmetal bismuth (6N) in the molar ratio of 1:100 were\nsealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule. The ampoule\nwas heated to 1273 K, and holding for two days. Crystals of CuIr2 S4 were grown by cooling at 4 K/hour down\nto 773 K. Typically, the crystals have triangular shape\nof surface with edge length about 0.4 mm. The nearnormal incidence reflectance spectra were measured by\nusing a Bruker 66v/S spectrometer in the frequency range\nfrom 100 cm\u22121 to 28000 cm\u22121 . The sample was mounted\non an optically black cone in a cold-finger flow cryostat.\nAn in situ overcoating technique was employed for reflectance measurement19 , which enables us to get reliable data on small-size samples. The spectra above 500\ncm\u22121 was collected on one single crystal, while the data\nin the far-infrared regime was obtained on mosaic crystal samples. The optical conductivity spectra were obtained from a Kramers-Kronig transformation of R(\u03c9).\n\n\f2\n1.0\n\n7\n\n4000\n\n0.8\n\ndown up\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n\u03c9 (cm )\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The optical conductivity spectrum of\nCuIr2 S4 at 300 K.

The dc resistivity as a function of temperature is shown in the inset. There is a sharp metalinsulator transition at 230 K. The optical spectrum shows\nan usual metallic response with a conductivity minimum\naround 9000 cm\u22121 . The spectrum could be well fitted with two Drude components and a Lorentz oscillator below the frequency of minimum conductivity. The\ntwo Drude components, which result from bands crossing\nthe Fermi energy, have plasma frequencies and scattering rates of \u03c9p1 \u2248 7000cm\u22121 , \u03931 \u2248 250 cm\u22121 and \u03c9p2 \u2248\n20000cm\u22121 , \u03932 \u2248 2400 cm\u22121 , respectively. The Lorentz\npart has a central frequency of 4000 cm\u22121 (0.5 eV).\nFig. 2 shows the reflectance and optical conductivity\nspectra at different temperatures over broad frequencies.\nThe spectra show little change as temperature decreases\nfrom 300 K to 232 K, except in the very low-frequency\nregion. However, upon entering the insulating phase,\ndramatic change occurs in optical spectra. The low-\u03c9\nspectral weight below 0.5 eV (4000 cm\u22121 ) is severely\nsuppressed, resulting in the opening of an optical gap.\nThe missing spectral weight is transferred to higher energies, forming a pronounced peak (\u03b1) at 0.5 eV. In addition, another peak (labelled as \u03b2) exists around 2 eV\n(16000 cm\u22121 ). This peak is also present in the metallic\nstate in high temperatures at slightly higher frequency.\nThe strong suppression of the low-energy spectral weight\nand the two-peaks (\u03b1 and \u03b2) structure are the most pronounced features below TMI .\n\n\u03c9 (cm )\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the reflectivity spectra (up panel) and optical conductivity spectra\n(bottom panel) for a CuIr2 S4 single crystal with TM I =230 K.\nAbrupt spectral change occurs at TM I .\n\nUnderstanding the above spectral change, which is the\nmain task of this work, is crucial for the understanding\nof the change of electronic structures above and below\nTMI . Because Cu at A site is in the Cu1+ valence state\n(3d10 )4 , the Cu 3d band is fully filled. The band structure calculations indicate that the Cu 3d band locates\nat about 3 eV below EF .3 Thus the MIT and the accompanied change is mainly due to the variation of the\nelectronic states of 5d transitional metal Ir. Due to the\ncrystal field and the hybridization between Ir 5d and S\n3p orbitals, the splitting of the eg and t2g bands of Ir 5d\nelectrons is fairly large.20 As a result, a low-spin state of\nIr 5d electrons is favored. The Ir eg band is empty and\nthe states near Fermi level are mainly contributed by the\nIr t2g bands, but hybridized with S 3p orbitals.\nLet us begin our discussion with the metallic phase in\nwhich CuIr2 S4 has normal cubic spinel structure. There\nis only one equivalent position for Ir in the structure\nwith a valence state of Ir+3.5 and the Ir 5d band is partially filled. Band structure calculation indicates that\ntwo bands arising from the hybridization of Ir 5d\u01eb (i.e.\nt2g ) and S 3p cross the Fermi energy3 . These two bands\nlead to the Drude responses in low frequencies. In this\ncase, the electronic state could be understood from the\nschematic picture of Fig. 3(a).\nUpon entering the insulating state, a first-order struc-\n\n\f3\n6000\n\n\u03c31 (\u03a9 cm )\n\n4000\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n228 K\n222 K\n205 K\n180 K\n20 K\n\n300 K\n232 K\n\n2000\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Schematic diagrams of the electronic\nstates above and below the MIT temperature. The enclosed\nareas above and below the horizontal lines represent the spinup and spin-down states. (a) Above TM I , Ir+3.5 has partially\nfilled t2g bands. (b) Below TM I , the structure contains only\nIr+3 and Ir+4 octamers. Ir3+ has fully filled t2g band and\ncompletely empty eg band. The Ir4+ should have a partially\nfilled band in one of t2g orbitals. However, the dimerization\nof Ir4+ makes the band split into two subbands.\n\ntural phase transition occurs and the lattice symmetry\nbecomes triclinic11 . Most remarkably, CuIr2 S4 undergoes\na complex charge-ordering transition. A group of 8 Ir3+\nor Ir4+ octahedra forms a cluster called octamer, which\ncan be viewed as planar hexagonal rings with two additional octahedra attached to the opposite sides. The Ir\nions in the Ir4+ octamers exhibits drastic alternations of\nlong and short Ir-Ir distances, whereas the Ir-Ir distance\nin Ir3+ -octamers are uniform11 . These structural features reveal important clues for the understanding of the\nlow-T optical spectra. Because of the low-spin state of Ir\nions, Ir3+ has fully filled t2g bands and completely empty\neg band. Therefore, the Ir3+ (spin s=0) octamers are insulating. The Ir4+ has t52g e0g configuration (spin S=1/2)\nand one of the t2g orbitals is half filled. In principle, a\nmaterial with a half filled band should be metallic. However, the dimerization of Ir4+ ions splits this band into\ntwo subbands. The lower subband is fully occupied while\nthe upper subband is empty (Fig. 3b). Since the \u03b1 peak\nappears only in the insulating phase, it is reasonable to\nattribute the \u03b1 peak to the transition of electrons from\nthe occupied Ir3+ t2g or lower Ir4+ t2g to upper Ir4+ t2g\nsubband. Since the transition of electrons from Ir4+ site\nto Ir4+ site actually requires to overcome additional onsite Coulomb repulsion energy, it is plausible that the\nlowest excitation is from Ir3+ t2g state to upper Ir4+ t2g\nsubband. This is equivalent to say that the \u03b1 peak is\noriginated from the inter-octamer hoppings. The \u03b2 peak\ncomes from the transition of electrons from the occupied\nIr t2g to the empty Ir eg bands. Since the unoccupied Ir\neg bands exist at temperature higher than the MIT, the \u03b2\ncomponent is observable even in the metallic phase. This\nis the reason why the temperature-dependence of the \u03b2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2\u2206\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n-1\n\n\u03c9 (cm )\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The temperature dependence of the\noptical conductivity in an expanded scale at low frequencies.\nA thin straight line is extrapolation of the onset of the peak\nfor the estimate of the magnitude of the optical gap.\n\npeak is different from that of the \u03b1 one. The interband\ntransition from Cu 3d to other unoccupied state should\nappear at higher energies.\nThe optical data and the analysis provide a clear picture about the change of electronic structures above and\nbelow the MIT temperature. The high-T metallic state\nis due to the band conduction of hybridized Ir t2g and S\n3p electrons. In the insulating state, the formation of the\nIr3+ and Ir4+ octamers results in two different types of\ninsulating clusters. Ir3+ octamers have fully occupied Ir\nt2g bands, whereas Ir4+ octamers produce two splitting\nsubbands because of the Ir4+ -Ir4+ dimerization. Furthermore, the dimerized Ir4+ ions form a spin singlet. It\nsuppresses the Pauli paramagnetism of CuIr2 S4 and leads\nto the diamagnetic nature of the insulating state10 .\nThe above discussion on the evolution of the electronic\nstates is consistent with a recent S K and Ir L3 x-ray absorption study on CuIr2 S4 by Croft et al.15 where similar\nredistribution of Ir 5d electronic states across the MIT\nhas been proposed. Apparently, the MIT of CuIr2 S4 is\ndifferent to the Verway transition in Fe3 O4 . Fe3 O4 contains relatively narrow 3d band and the charge ordering is most likely caused by the competition between the\nbandwidth and strong intersite Coulomb repulsion17,21 .\nHowever, CuIr2 S4 is expected to have a wide 5d band and\nweaker Coulomb repulsion. The MIT in CuIr2 S4 is due\nto the reconstruction of Ir 5d bands associated with the\nstructural change.\nOur result shows unambiguously that the MIT in\nCuIr2 S4 is directly correlated with the structureal instability. It seems that this structural instability is unique\nin the CuIr2 S4 family. Any substitution to A-sites (e.g.\nZn for Cu)10,14 or B-sites (e.g. Rh for Ir)6 or S-sites (e.g.\nSe for S)5 will suppress the structural deformation and\n\n\f4\ndrive the compound into metallic or superconducting in\nlow temperatures. The strong electron-phonon coupling\nis the most probable mechanism responsible for the structural instability. Further theoretical and experimental efforts to the understanding of this mechanism are desired.\nFig. 4 shows the low-\u03c9 conductivity spectra in an expanded scale. Below the MIT temperature, the optical\nconductivity increases quickly above 1000 cm\u22121 . A rough\nestimation of the optical gap could be obtained by extrapolating the linear increasing part to the base line of\n\u03c3(\u03c9)=0. This gives the value of the optical gap 2\u2206 \u223c\n1200 cm\u22121 ( 0.15 eV). The gap magnitude (\u2206) is close\nto the activated gap values estimated from several dc\nresistivity measurements1,2 . Matsuno et al. performed\nphotoemission measurements on CuIr2 S4 , but assigned\na much smaller gap amplitude of \u223c 20meV in the insulating phase4 . However, by looking at their spectral\ncurves at 250 K and 30 K, we found that the spectral\nedge actually shifts about 70 to 80 meV away from the\nFermi level, and seemed to be consistent with our experiment. Additionally, we found that the energy gap\nchanges very little as the temperature increases from 10\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nElectronic address: nlwang@aphy.iphy.ac.cn\nS.

The sudden opening of the energy gap below\nMIT is associated with the structureal transition, and is\na characteristic feature of the first-order structural phase\ntransition.\nTo conclude, optical conductivity spectra have been\ninvestigated for single crystals of CuIr2 S4 . The metallic\nresponse at high temperature is due to the band conduction of Ir t2g electrons, which are hybridized with S 3p\nelectrons. The MIT in CuIr2 S4 is caused by the reconstruction of Ir 5d bands associated with the structural\nchange. The formations of the Ir3+ and Ir4+ octamers\nbelow TMI result in two different types of insulating clusters. We attribute the \u03b1 peak to the transition of electrons from the occupied Ir3+ t2g state to upper Ir4+ t2g\nsubband created by the spin-dimerization in the Ir4+ octamers, and the \u03b2 component to the transition from the\noccupied Ir t2g to the empty Ir eg bands.\nThis work is supported by National Science Foundation of China (No. 10025418, 10104012, 10374109), the\nKnowledge Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of\nSciences.\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n(2001).\nH.
