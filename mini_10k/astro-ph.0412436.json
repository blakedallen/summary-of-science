In AugustSeptember 2002 we acquired a total of 1077 high resolution spectra (\u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb \u223c\n25, 000) in the K-band (2 \u03bcm) wavelength region using NIRSPEC on the Keck II\ntelescope during three transits. These data are more numerous and of better\nquality than the data analyzed in an initial search by Brown et al.

About 15% of these extrasolar planets orbit within \u223c 0.05\nAU of their stars, the so-called 'hot Jupiters'. The small orbital radii of hot Jupiters implies\nthat they have significant probabilities (\u223c 0.1) of transiting their stars, and six transiting\nsystems are known (Charbonneau et al. 2000; Henry et al. 2000; Konacki et al. 2003, 2004;\nBouchy et al. 2004; Alonso et al. 2004; Pont et al. 2004). Transits provide opportunities\nto perform absorption spectroscopy of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets (Seager and\nSasselov 2000; Hubbard et al. 2001; Brown 2001). The extrasolar planet HD 209458b is\nilluminated during transit by a relatively bright star (V=7.65), permitting spectroscopy to\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), at high spectral resolution. Charbonneau et al. (2002) used\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntransmission spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to detect\natomic sodium in the atmosphere of HD 209458b. They discovered that sodium absorption\nis weak relative to predictions (Seager and Sasselov 2000; Brown 2001), and several models\nfor this weakness have been suggested (reviewed by Seager 2003, also see Fortney et al. 2003\nand Burrows et al. 2004). The models that explain the weakness of the observed sodium fall\ninto two categories: 1) those invoking unique properties of sodium, such as a low sodium\nabundance, or 2) those invoking some more general property of the atmosphere, such as high\nclouds. By searching for other spectral features during transit, we can begin to discriminate\nbetween these two classes of models.\nIn addition to sodium, atomic hydrogen has been detected in UV absorption (VidalMadjar et al. 2003), with evidence for oxygen and carbon absorption (< 3\u03c3 detections, VidalMadjar et al. 2004). Unlike sodium in the hydrostatic atmosphere, the UV absorptions are\nrelatively strong (5\u201315%) and extend to several planetary radii. Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003)\nconclude that they have observed an escaping planetary coma.\nAll spectroscopic detections of extrasolar planetary atmospheres to date have been made\nfrom space-borne platforms. But it should be possible to make such detections from the\nground. Molecular transitions in hot Jupiters often coincide with telluric transmission windows, either because of the large planetary Doppler shift (Wiedemann et al. 2001) or negligible level populations in the corresponding telluric lines (Harrington et al. 2003). Carbon\nmonoxide is a prime target for ground-based detection. It is predicted to be abundant at\ntypical hot Jupiter temperatures (Burrows and Sharp 1999) and has strong and discrete\ntransitions in a favorable window near 2 \u03bcm. Moreover, CO should not be significantly depleted by photochemistry (Liang et al. 2003), but might actually be increased in abundance\nby mixing from greater depth (Noll et al. 1997). However, like sodium, CO may be hidden\nby cloud opacity. An infrared spectroscopic study of the 2 \u03bcm continuum by Richardson\net al. (2003b) suggests the presence of substantial cloud opacity, even on the stellar-facing\nhemisphere of the planet.\nBrown et al. (2002) reported an exploratory attempt to detect CO in HD 209458b during\ntransit using data from the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) on the Keck II telescope.\nThey observed only a single transit, and their spectra were degraded by poor weather, light\nlosses in the adaptive optics system, and prominent fringing in NIRSPEC. Nevertheless, they\ndemonstrated sensitivity within a factor of three of that needed to detect planetary CO in a\nplausible model. In this paper we report follow-up observations with NIRSPEC on Keck II\nthat improve sensitivity by about a factor of ten.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed 3 transits of HD 209458b on 19 August, 26 August, and 2 September\n2002 UT using NIRSPEC (McLean et al. 1998) on the Keck II telescope without adaptive\noptics. Each night's observations consist of a nearly continuous sequence of (typically) 45sec integrations on HD 209458 from several hours before the center of transit to several\nhours after. We observed at wavelength \u03bb \u223c 2.3 \u03bcm (K band) with spectral resolution\n\u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb = 25, 000, where \u03b4\u03bb is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the instrument\nprofile and covers \u223c 3 pixels. In order to facilitate the greatest possible stability in the\nspectra, and the most efficient temporal duty cycle, we did not nod the telescope. We kept\nthe star at a single position on the 0.43 \u00d7 24 arc-sec slit. Dark frame exposure times bracket\nthe stellar exposures and flat fields come from spectra of a continuum lamp. Each spectral\nframe consists of 6 non-contiguous echelle orders (3 of which contain CO lines). Each order\ncovers \u223c 60 cm\u22121 , (\u223c 0.06 cm\u22121 per pixel). We used an order-sorting filter with 50%\ntransmission at 5400 and 3800 cm\u22121 (1.84 & 2.63 \u03bcm).\nPassing cirrus clouds interrupted observations on 19 August, especially in the first half\nof the night. On 19 August and especially early on 26 August, the grating position made\nuncontrolled moves of a few pixels, sufficient to greatly complicate our analysis. These\nuncontrolled grating moves are a recognized problem with NIRSPEC. The recommended\nsolution (at that time) was to turn off the image rotation. Accordingly, we observed for\nmost of 26 August and all of 2 September without using image rotation.\nWe recorded a total of 379, 456, and 354 spectra on 19 August, 26 August, and 2 September, respectively. We reject 32 spectra from 19 August due to low signal level from cirrus\ncloud absorption, and we reject the first 80 spectra taken on 26 August, due to the uncontrolled grating motion (see Sec. 4). The analysis of this paper is therefore based on a total\nof 1077 spectra, each comprising \u223c 103 independent spectral resolution elements.\n\n3.\n\nTheoretical Transit Spectra\n\nSearching for CO absorption in the transiting planet requires averaging over multiple\nlines in several vibration-rotation bands to achieve the required SNR. We perform this averaging, in effect, by fitting the observed spectral residuals (Sec. 4.2) to a theoretical template\nspectrum using linear least squares (Sec. 4.6). For diagnostic purposes, we repeat this fit over\na grid of theoretical template spectra. Our intent in this paper is to define the range of atmospheric parameters allowed by our observations, not to construct physically self-consistent\nmodels. We therefore begin with a radiative equlibrium temperature profile from Sudarsky\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\net al. (2003), and perturb it in an ad hoc fashion. We represent clouds by setting the total\nopacity to be infinite for pressures greater than either 1, 2, 3, 10, 37, 100, or 1000 mbar. We\nalso add various \u03b4T values to the temperature at all pressures, choosing from \u03b4T = +200,\n0, -200, -300, -500 and -700 Kelvins. We define our fiducial model to be the unperturbed\nSudarsky et al. (2003) T-P profile (\u03b4T = 0), with cloud tops at 0.1/e bar = 37 mbar. This\ncloud top pressure was used as a fiducial model by Charbonneau et al. (2002), so this choice\nallows us to judge the strength of any CO absorption relative to the sodium detection.\nOur computation of the theoretical template spectra utilizes the IDL code developed by\nRichardson et al. (2003b), modified for tangent-path spherical geometry. After adding the\n\u03b4T to the Sudarsky et al. (2003) T-P profile, we define the height scale (h) by integrating\nthe equation of hydrostatic equilibrium with surface gravity g = 945 cm sec\u22122 (Brown et\nal. 2001). We choose the constant of integration so that h = 0 occurs where the continuum\noptical depth in the tangent-path geometry equals unity. We take the planet's radius to be\nthe distance from the planet's center to the h = 0 point. In practice, the continuum optical\ndepth becomes unity very close to the pressure level assumed for the cloud tops (see below).\nTherefore, in the absence of stellar limb darkening, the computed eclipse depth in the 2 \u03bcm\ncontinuum will be (Rp /Rs )2 = 0.0146 independent of the cloud top pressure level, where Rp\nis the planet radius, and Rs is the stellar radius, both from Brown et al. (2001).\nAt each wavelength we compute the total tangent path optical depth as a function\nof tangent height, using spherical geometry. Refraction in the planet's atmosphere can\nbe significant in other transit-related applications (Hui & Seager 2002), but will not have\na measurable effect on our transmission spectra, especially considering the much smaller\nrefractivity values at this long wavelength. We therefore neglect refraction in our computed\nspectra. The area of an atmospheric annulus at each tangent height is weighted by the\nfactor 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 , and the annuli are summed to give the total blocking area of the planet as a\nfunction of wavelength. The continuum optical depth is due to collision-induced H2 -H2 and\nH2 -He opacity (Borysow 2002; Jorgensen et al. 2000). The line opacity at each wavelength\nis computed by summing opacities from all lines within some adjustable interval (typically 3\ncm\u22121 ), with the opacity profile of each line computed exactly from the Voigt function. We use\na single damping coefficient for all lines of a given species, based on averaging HITRAN 2000\ndata. The CO line wavelengths and strengths were taken from Goorvitch (1994), including\nisotopic lines in solar abundance ratios. The ratio of the planet's blocking area to the area\nof the stellar disk, with a correction for stellar limb darkening, is the transit depth at that\nwavelength, d\u03bb .\nOur CO search requires that we consider the effect of water absorption, because significant water lines overlay CO at some wavelengths. The water molecule exhibits millions of\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ntransitions in the wavelength regions we have observed, most of these being quite weak. We\nevaluated the possible effect of a quasi-continuous opacity due to numerous overlapping weak\nwater lines, using the water line data from Partridge and Schwenke (1997). These data show\na line density of \u223c 3000 lines per cm\u22121 in the 2 \u03bcm region, potentially sufficient to obscure\nthe contrast in the CO transit spectrum. We scaled the strengths of all the water lines to\nthe \u223c constant temperature above the cloud tops, and summed their scaled strengths in bins\nof 0.01 cm\u22121 width. The total strength in each bin was then treated as a single pseudo-line,\nwith lower state energy of zero. This treatment will be relatively accurate for the upper layers of HD 209458b's atmosphere, because our bin size is comparable to the Doppler width,\nand because the temperature in the Sudarsky et al. (2003) model remains relatively constant\nat the greatest heights. The thermochemical equilibrium abundances of CO and water were\ncomputed from the formulae given by Burrows and Sharp (1999). Since water is likely to be\ndepleted by photolysis at high altitudes (Liang et al. 2003), our assumption of equilibrium\nwater abundance is conservative for the purpose of detecting CO.\nOur tangent-path spectrum code does not attempt to modify the pressure-temperature\nrelation from the stellar-facing to anti-stellar hemispheres. However, we include template\nspectra where we set the CO mixing ratio to zero on the anti-stellar side, simulating the\neffect of a large temperature difference (Showman and Guillot 2002). We use a constant\nradial velocity along each line of sight. However, we do include the effect of planetary\nrotation, assumed to be tidal-locked solid-body rotation. We shift the spectrum in velocity\ncorresponding to multiple azimuth points in the atmospheric annulus, and add these shifted\nspectra to produce a rotationally-broadened template.\nOur tangent-path code has been checked in two ways. First, its ancestor code (for normal\nincidence spectra) was checked against independent calculations by Sara Seager (Richardson\net al. 2003b), and second, we compared the present calculations against selected individual\nCO lines in the transit spectra computed by Brown (2001). Figure 1 shows our template\nspectra, based on convolving the transit depths (d\u03bb) to the spectral resolution of NIRSPEC.\nThe difference in transit depth between the continuum and the strongest CO lines is \u223c 0.001\nin the unconvolved (0.5 km sec\u22121 resolution) spectra. This reduces to \u223c 0.0004 at NIRSPEC\nresolution.\n\n4.\n\nData Analysis\n\nA first analysis of the data for the best night (26 August) was done (by TMB) using\nthe cross-correlation/singular-value-decomposition method described by Brown et al. (2002).\nFrom this first look, TMB concluded that no CO absorption could be detected in the spectra,\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nto a limit \u223c 3 times less than the expected amount. It was also evident that the data were of\nsufficient quality that the singular-value-decomposition formalism was no longer necessary.\nWe have accordingly analyzed the full set of data using more conventional methods. Our\nprimary analysis uses linear least squares to correlate the data against the ensemble of lines\nin each template spectrum. We have also checked the least squares results using crosscorrelation calculations.\nThe data analysis consists of: 1) extraction of spectra from the raw spectral frames,\n2) wavelength calibration and correction for telluric absorption to yield spectral residuals,\n3) injection of fake signals into copies of the extracted spectra, to be analyzed in parallel\nwith the real data, 4) evaluation of the noise level as a function of time, wavelength, and\ntemporal frequency, 5) fitting the template spectrum to the residuals by linear least squares\nto estimate the amplitude of CO absorption in each spectrum, and 6) fitting a transit curve\nto the CO absorption amplitudes.\n\n4.1.\n\nSpectrum Extractions\n\nOur choice to observe without nodding places stringent demands on the spectrum extraction procedure, because effects normally removed by nodding (sky emission and some\nartifacts such as 'hot pixels') have to be removed by numerical filters. We therefore performed spectrum extractions using a custom IDL code, not the NIRSPEC facility codes, and\nwe describe this process in more detail than usual.\nFor each spectral frame, we subtract a dark frame and divide by a flat-field frame. The\nflat-field frame is a pixel-by-pixel median of a series of continuum lamp exposures, each\nnormalized to the same total intensity. For each spectral frame, we compute a pixel-by-pixel\nmedian of five frames centered on the given frame. We subtract the median frame from the\ngiven frame to form a difference frame. A two-stage, 1D median filter is applied to rows (along\nthe dispersion direction) of the difference frame, with decreasing width and threshold. This\nremoves energetic particle events and the most obvious hot pixels. In addition, we compute\nthe pixel-by-pixel variance in the series of flat-field (continuum lamp) spectra, and we use\nthese variances with an appropriate threshold to replace noisy pixels ('warm pixels') in the\ndifference frame. The filtered difference frame is then added back to the median frame to\nproduce a cleaned version of the given frame.\nThe curvature of each echelle order on the cleaned frame is determined by fitting a\nGaussian to the spatial profile of the star along the slit at each wavelength. A 4th order\npolynominal fit to the Gaussian centroid positions defines the spatial center of the order as a\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nslowly-varying function of wavelength. The spatial profile along the slit at each wavelength is\nthen spline-interpolated to a common spatial grid to define the average spatial profile for each\nechelle order. This spatial profile is computed separately for each echelle order, but we found\nthat it does not vary significantly with wavelength in a given order. The spatial profile is fit\nto the original data at each wavelength by linear least squares, with free parameters being\namplitude and zero-point in intensity. The fitted amplitude is equivalent to the optimal\nspectrum value at that wavelength (Horne 1986), and the background subtraction occurs\nautomatically via the zero-point of the fit. In this process, we reject further warm pixels based\non the residuals from the fit of the spatial profile to the data. Our procedure ignores the tilt of\nthe slit. In principle this can degrade the spectral resolution, but degradation in resolution is\nnegligible for our data because each spectrum is narrow in spatial extent (\u223c 5 pixels FWHM),\nand because the CO absorption fortunately occurs in echelle orders where the tilt of the slit\nis minimal (\u2264 0.04 pixels in \u03bb, per spatial pixel). We verified the resolution of the extracted\nspectra by fitting Gaussian profiles to determine the widths of minimally-blended telluric\nlines, and we obtained good agreement with the nominal NIRSPEC resolution.\n\n4.2.\n\nTelluric Corrections and Wavelength Calibration\n\nThe extracted spectra are generally not coincident in wavelength. We therefore shift the\nspectra to make them coincident and apply a wavelength calibration to the average spectrum\nas follows. We begin by computing an order-by-order average of the non-coincident spectra.\nEach order of a given spectrum is then spline-shifted in small increments (0.025 pixels) and\nfitted to the average spectrum at each shift value by stretching in intensity using linear least\nsquares. The rms difference in intensity is tabulated vs. shift, and a parabolic fit finds the\n'best' shift from the minimum rms difference. Normalization in intensity uses a continuum\nfit. About 10 continuum windows are selected in each order, and the continuum is derived\nfrom a 4th order polynominal fit to the intensity of each spectrum in those windows. We\ndivide the observed spectrum by the wavelength-integrated intensity under the continuum fit\n(not a point-by-point division). We then fit the log of intensity to airmass at each wavelength\nusing linear least squares and correct each spectrum, at each wavelength, to an airmass of\nunity. (For 19 August we make separate airmass corrections for the first and second halves\nof the night, since sky conditions changed.) The airmass corrections ranged in value from\n\u223c 0.03 magnitudes per airmass for the best windows to > 1 in telluric lines.\nIf telluric absorption were strictly proportional to airmass, the spectra corrected as\ndescribed above would vary only due to absorption by the planet during transit. However,\nFourier analysis of the intensities at each wavelength show power spectra whose amplitudes\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nincrease sharply for time intervals greater than \u223c 15 minutes (2 cycles per hour). We\ndenote this as '1/f' noise (without implying that the noise power is strictly proportional to\nthe inverse of frequency). The 1/f noise is more pronounced near telluric water lines, but is\nevident to some degree virtually everywhere in the spectra. These ubiquitous slow variations\nin the terrestrial atmosphere cannot be completely corrected using any proportional-toairmass technique, and they are the limiting source of error in our analysis. Fortunately,\nthey are partially correlated between closely spaced wavelengths, so we can remove them\nto some degree using a high-pass digital filter. For a given wavelength \u03bb, we compute the\naverage out-of-transit spectrum over the wavelength range \u03bb \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb to \u03bb + \u03b4\u03bb. where \u03b4\u03bb is\n3 times the NIRSPEC spectral resolution. We fit this short fiducial spectral segment to the\ncorresponding portion of each individual spectrum, scaling it in intensity by using linear\nleast squares. The difference between the best scaled fiducial segment and the real spectrum\nat wavelength \u03bb and time t is denoted as the residual intensity r\u03bbt , in units of the stellar\ncontinuum. The r\u03bbt are the fundamental data in which we search for real planetary CO\nabsorption during transit. The computation and fitting of the fiducial segment is repeated\nat each wavelength. The choice of \u03b4\u03bb equal to 3 NIRSPEC resolution elements (9 pixels) is\noptimal for removing telluric effects while passing real signal. This optimal value is selected\nby trial and error: we vary \u03b4\u03bb and monitor the magnitude of the remaining low frequency\ntelluric variations, and the amplitude of the transit in data containing a fake transit signal.\nWavelength calibration is performed, order-by-order, using the average of the coincident\nand normalized spectra. (We do the actual calibration in frequency, not wavelength.) In\neach echelle order we choose about 12 minimally-blended telluric calibrating lines, and we fit\nparabolas to their profiles within one spectral resolution element of the intensity minimum.\nThese fits to the line cores minimize contamination by line blends and define the precise pixel\npositions of the telluric calibrating lines. To relate the pixel positions to wavenumber, we use\nthe digital version of the high-resolution solar spectral atlas (Livingston and Wallace 1991).\nConvolving this atlas to NIRSPEC resolution, we perform the same parabolic fits as on the\nNIRSPEC lines. This yields effective wavenumbers for the telluric calibrating lines at NIRSPEC resolution. A quadratic fit of the pixel positions to the effective wavenumbers provides\ncoefficients of the wavelength calibration. One can judge the precision of this calibration from\nthe scatter in the fits of wavenumber to pixel position, which is 0.01 to 0.02 cm\u22121 (0.18 to\n0.35 pixels), depending on the echelle order. Figure 2 shows the wavelength-calibrated spectrum in echelle order 33, for 26 August 2002 (compare to Figure 1 of Brown et al. 2002).\nAll of the structure visible in Figure 2 is either telluric absorption (primarily methane), or\ninstrumental effects (fringing in NIRSPEC). The fringing seen in our spectra is similar in\nperiod and amplitude to that seen by Brown et al. (2002), but is more stable.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n4.3.\n\nNoise Level and Fringe Removal\n\nThe noise level \u03c3\u03bbt is a function of time, wavelength, and temporal frequency. Time\ndependence derives from the variation of signal strength with airmass, and general sky clarity,\nand wavelength dependence derives from the grating blaze function and the telluric line\nspectrum. The dependence on temporal frequency derives from the 1/f noise described above.\nAt a given wavelength, we compute the variance of the r\u03bbt residuals in two bandwidths, with\ntime varying, by summing the power spectrum over the appropriate limits. We denote\nthe standard deviations as \u03c3\u03bbh and \u03c3\u03bbl , where h and l denotes frequencies higher and lower\nthan 2 cycles per hour, respectively. The square root of the quadratic sum of \u03c3\u03bbh and \u03c3\u03bbl is\ndenoted \u03c3\u03bb , the total noise level in intensity at wavelength \u03bb. \u03c3\u03bb is shown vs. wavelength\nin Figure 3 for echelle order 33, on 26 August, 2002. The best wavelengths exhibit SNR\n(= 1/\u03c3\u03bb ) \u223c 300, but the noise level increases sharply near some telluric lines. We therefore\nreject some wavelengths from our analysis, based on the \u03c3\u03bb values. Typically we mask out\nthose wavelengths where \u03c3\u03bb exceeds 200% of a 'baseline' noise level, obtained as the lower\nenvelope of the \u03c3\u03bb values. The masked wavelengths are overplotted with diamond symbols\non Figure 3, and they invariably correspond to wavelengths near telluric lines (compare\nFigures 2 & 3).\nIn addition to the \u03c3\u03bb values, we also have an estimate of how the noise varies from\nspectrum to spectrum, from the fits of individual spectra to the average spectrum, a byproduct of making the spectra coincident in wavelength. We denote the average noise level of\nthe spectrum at time t as \u03c3t . We can therefore estimate the noise level expected for each pixel\nh\nl\nin each spectrum, in each bandwidth, \u03c3\u03bbt\n, and \u03c3\u03bbt\n, and the total over all frequencies \u03c3\u03bbt , by\nassuming that the time and bandwidth variations are independent of \u03bb (an approximation),\n2\nand requiring that the sum of \u03c3\u03bbt\nequal N\u03c3\u03bb2 for each \u03bb, in each bandwidth, where N is the\nnumber of spectra for that night. The best \u03c3\u03bbt values are lower than the \u03c3\u03bb values shown\nin Figure 3, because \u03c3\u03bb includes spectra taken over all airmass values. Our best spectra\nhave peak signal levels per column of \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 105 electrons, so we should reach the Poisson\nelectron statistical limit (SNR \u223c 380) for the best \u03c3\u03bbt . The \u03c3\u03bbt distribution has 63% of its\nSNR values between 200 and 400, with 26% having SNR < 200, and 11% with SNR > 400.\nThis sharper cutoff at high SNR is consistent with reaching the photon noise limit.\nThere are two additional error sources in our spectra. First, there is the optical fringing\nwith two distinct periods, noted by Brown et al. (2002). Both fringe systems are found in our\ndata; however, they are less time-variable than experienced by Brown et al. (2002). Some\nof this optical fringing is removed by the digital filter which produces the r\u03bbt . However,\nFourier analysis of the r\u03bbt data reveals that both fringe systems remain detectable. When\nthe residual fringes' amplitudes exceed 0.25 in the log of the average power spectrum per\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nechelle order per night, Fourier notch filters remove them. Second, extra noise is ubiquitous\nnear the Nyquist frequency (0.5 cycles per pixel) in the power spectra of the r\u03bbt with \u03bb\nvarying. This probably derives from the array detector electronics. We remove it prior to\nthe digital filter step by zeroing the Nyquist frequency in the Fourier spectrum. Figure 4\npresents the stacked, wavelength-coincident spectra and the r\u03bbt values for echelle order 33\non 26 August 2002, as false color images.\nA complete understanding of the errors requires comparing the distribution of r\u03bbt to\na normal error curve, and also examining whether the noise power per unit bandwidth is\nconstant (white noise). Although the error level varies with time and wavelength, the ratio\nof the individual residual values to their expected error, \u03c3r\u03bbt\n, should approach a Gaussian\n\u03bbt\nerror distribution, with a standard deviation of unity. Figure 5 (upper panel) shows this\ndistribution totaled over all 3 nights and all 3 echelle orders, on a log scale. Within 3\u03c3 this\ndistribution is very close to the Gaussian error curve. However, the data exhibit an excess\nof points in the wings beyond \u00b13\u03c3. Specifically, 0.5% of the 3.02 \u00d7 106 points lie beyond\n3\u03c3, and 0.05% are beyond 4\u03c3. A Gaussian distribution predicts 0.27% and 0.006% beyond\n3\u03c3 and 4\u03c3 respectively. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, we verified that the number of\nexcess points in the wings of the data distribution are not sufficient to have a significant\nimpact on our results, nor to affect our error analysis significantly, particularly since they\nare uncorrelated with transit phase. A more serious problem is the fact that the noise power\nper unit bandwidth is not constant, i.e. the 1/f character previously mentioned. We compute\nthe power spectrum of each r\u03bbt series, with t varying, using a Lomb-Scargle algorithm (Press\net al. 1994). The average of these power spectra for all \u03bb over all three nights is shown as\nthe lower panel of Figure 5. The sharp increase in noise power below \u223c 2 cycles per night is\nquite evident; this increased noise at low frequencies would be about 2 times worse (0.3 in\nthe log) without the digital filter technique described above.\n\n4.4.\n\nValidation Using Fake Signals\n\nIn order to verify that our analysis is sensitive to the low levels of absorption expected\nin transit spectra, we have injected fake signals into the data and recovered them with our\nanalysis procedures. The first fake signal is generated from the CO template spectrum of\nthe fiducial model (Figure 1, solid line), Doppler shifted into the frame of the planet, and\nconvolved to NIRSPEC spectral resolution. We adopted a heliocentric radial velocity for\nthe system of Vr = \u221214.76 km sec\u22121 (Nidever et al. 2002), and a planetary orbital velocity\namplitude of 142 km sec\u22121 . The orbital period and transit times are very precisely known\n(Wittenmeyer et al. 2002; Schultz et al. 2003; Charbonneau et al. 2003), and we corrected for\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthe Earth's orbital motion, both in radial velocity and light travel time. A second fake signal\nis generated using the CO+water template spectrum (Figure 1, dotted line), and similarly\ntransformed to the frame of the planet. We injected the fake signals into the data after the\nwavelength calibration, but before the digital filter and fringe removal. We therefore analyze\nthree sets of data in parallel: the real data, and two copies of the real data with injected\nfake signals. Each of these data sets is analyzed against a grid of template spectra, where\nwe offset the temperature in the model atmosphere, and vary the cloud height. In some\ncases we also set the CO mixing ratio to zero on the anti-stellar hemisphere of the planet,\nto simulate the worst-case effect of a large diurnal temperature difference.\n\n4.5.\n\nThe Stellar Spectrum\n\nOur spectra contain significant information concerning the spectrum of the star, i.e.\nHD 209458a. Two aspects of the stellar spectrum are relevant to the transit analysis. First,\nwe have searched for stellar CO absorption. In the solar spectrum, the first overtone CO\nfeatures are relatively prominent, having line depths, when convolved to NIRSPEC resolution, of \u223c 6%. Stellar lines are removed by the procedures that compute the r\u03bbt residuals,\nso we have to identify them prior to removal of telluric lines. Also, stellar lines are not\nsignificantly modulated by the transit. Hence, they are somewhat difficult to detect. We\ntherefore overlaid and averaged 26 lines of stellar CO lying in good telluric transmission\nwindows. We see no evidence of a CO signature in the stacked spectra, with the confusion\nlimit being determined by the telluric background at the \u03c3 \u223c 0.5% level. CO lines of solar\nstrength would be easily seen (\u223c 12\u03c3), but HD 209458a shows no detectable CO features.\nWe considered whether the system might be lacking in carbon and/or oxygen, but the star\nhas normal metallicity (Mazeh et al. 2000), and 2- to 3\u03c3 evidence for both carbon and oxygen is seen in the planet's UV transit spectrum (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2004). It is more likely\nthat the non-appearance of stellar CO is related to the temperature of HD 209458a, which\nis slightly hotter than the sun (Mazeh et al. 2000; Ribas et al. 2003).\nAlthough stellar CO is not detected in our spectra, we do detect the few stellar atomic\nlines that are expected. We used 5 atomic lines to derive the star's radial velocity. We\nidentified the lines using the Livingston and Wallace (1991) solar atlas, and fit parabolas\nto their line cores in both our Keck spectra and the solar atlas convolved to NIRSPEC\nresolution. On this basis we derive a heliocentric radial velocity for the system of \u221215.4 \u00b1 0.5\nkm sec\u22121 , agreeing with the more precise Nidever et al. (2002) value, within our error. This\nserves as an independent check on our velocity transformation between the planet frame and\nthe heliocentric frame.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n4.6.\n\nTransit Spectrum Amplitudes and Transit Curve Fit\n\nFor each observed spectrum (at time t), we determine the degree to which the template\ntransit spectrum (d\u03bb ) is present in the r\u03bbt values. We Doppler shift the template spectrum to\nthe frame of the planet, convolve it to NIRSPEC resolution (see above), and filter it exactly\nas we filter the data. This transformed and filtered template spectrum (d\u22c6\u03bb ) is used as the\nindependent variable, with the r\u03bbt values as the dependent variable, in a linear regression at\neach t:\nr\u03bbt = z + a(t)d\u22c6\u03bb ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z is a zero-point constant having no significance, and a(t) is the statistical bestestimate of the amplitude of the template transit spectrum in the r\u03bbt at that time (this\ntreatment follows Richardson et al. 2003a). If the template spectrum is an exact description\nof the planet's transit spectrum, then the a(t) will lie on a transit curve which is zero out\nof transit and dips to -1 during transit (the negative sign denotes absorption, the d\u03bb being\nproportional to the blocking area). As an added dimension to this calculation, we vary the\nassumed heliocentric radial velocity of the HD 209458 center of mass, by up to \u00b1235 km\nsec\u22121 (\u00b150 pixels), and we tabulate a(t) for each Vr . Since line structure in the template\ncorresponds to entirely different pixels in the data as Vr is varied significantly, this added\ndimension serves to check the errors and significance of our results.\nFor the 26 August data, our first 80 spectra showed particularly troublesome uncontrolled grating motion. We found a systematic error in results based on these data, evident\nas a correlation between the spectrum shift and the a(t). These 80 spectra were all taken\nprior to the start of transit. Since this portion of the transit curve is adequately sampled by\nother nights, we have deleted the first 80 spectra taken on 26 August from our analysis, as\nnoted in Sec. 2.\nl\nh\nWe input the \u03c3\u03bbt , \u03c3\u03bbt\n, and \u03c3\u03bbt\nvalues to the least squares fits in order to estimate the\nerrors in the a(t) over the corresponding bandwidths, denoted \u03c3a , \u03c3al , and \u03c3ah . The \u03c3a are\ntypically as large, or larger, than the amplitude itself (SNR. 1). Nevertheless, the linearity\nof the analysis preserves the fidelity of the signal when the amplitudes from 1077 spectra are\nconsidered, and the expected SNR on the transit curve becomes sufficient to expect detection\nof CO absorption.\n\nFitting a theoretical transit curve to the a(t) vs. time implicitly involves averaging\nthem. This requires proper accounting for the errors as a function of frequency. For example,\nspectra taken in quick succession will produce an average a(t) whose high frequency error of\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe mean decreases as the inverse square root of their number. But averaging spectra over\nbrief intervals will not similarly reduce the low frequency errors, which can be correlated over\nshort times. We are not aware of any rigorous methodology for treating non-white quasiGaussian errors in data analysis. We therefore implement the approach of approximating\nthe full Fourier spectrum by two frequency bands, above and below 2 cycles per hour. We\naverage the a(t) for each night in 15-minute bins (0.003 in phase). Within a given bin on\na given night, the high frequency errors apply, and the low frequency errors apply when\ncomparing one bin to another. The binning involves a weighted average: within bin i on\nnight j the a(t) are weighted by the inverse square of their \u03c3ah . The error associated with\nthe average of bin i on night j is given as:\n\u03c3ij = (\n\nX\n\n1\n\n(\u03c3ah )2 /N 2 + (\u03c3al )2 ) 2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the sum extends over the N amplitudes in bin ij and \u03c3al is the typical low\nfrequency error common to all points in the bin (the low frequency errors do not vary\nstrongly within each ij bin). Eq.(2) is easily derived from first principles, and we have\nverified it using numerical simulations. A grand average amplitude at phase i results from\ncombining bins at all j (all nights), weighting the ij bin averages by the inverse square of\n\u03c3ij . We similarly combine the \u03c3ij to yield the error for the grand average amplitude at phase\ni.\nWe fit a theoretical transit curve to the grand average amplitudes and their errors. The\nshape of the theoretical transit curve is generated by numerically simulating the passage of\nthe planet across a limb-darkened star, and the depth is normalized to unity, to be consistent\nwith the amplitude retrievals (see above). The stellar and planet parameters were adopted\nfrom Brown et al. (2001), and the stellar limb-darkening at 2 \u03bcm was taken from the solar\nobservations of Pierce et al. (1950).\n\n5.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 6 plots the retrieved CO amplitudes, a(t), for the fiducial model vs. phase. The\n1077 individual a(t) are shown in the top panel, with error bars supressed for clarity, but\nwith different colors used for the three nights. The middle panel shows the grand average\namplitudes binned over phase (bin width =0.003), with error bars added. To clarify our sign\nconventions, recall that points with negative amplitudes denote absorption. We fit a transit\ncurve dipping to negative values during transit, so the fit of a negative curve to negative CO\namplitudes should retrieve a positive depth (+1.0 if the fiducial model is correct). The transit\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ncurve is fit to the binned amplitudes in the middle panel, giving a depth of \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.14\nin model units, i.e. no evidence of CO absorption matching our template spectrum during\ntransit.\np The solid line shows this best fit. The square root of the reduced chi-squared of the\nfit, \u03c72 /M = 1.19, where M is the number of degrees of freedom. Hence, the scatter in the\nbinned amplitudes is somewhat greater than the error bars, which result from propagating\nthe error in the r\u03bbt values consistently through our linear analysis. The dashed red line in\nthe middle panel shows a transit amplitude of unity, which is obviously incompatible with\nthe data.\nThe lower panel of Figure 6 shows the binned fake data with transit curve fit. Our\nanalysis recovers 82% of the input signal, with a least squares best fit transit depth of\n0.82 \u00b1 0.14; this transit is shown as the solid red line. Note that only the relative depth of\nthe transit curve is significant in these fits: the zero point displacement in amplitude units\nhas no significance.\nThe 1/f noise in the r\u03bbt produces a noticeable signature on Figure 6. Slow variations\nare evident in the top panel, giving the points in each color a quasi-patterned appearance.\nThese variations ultimately derive from the variability of the terrestrial atmosphere. To\ninvestigate the error and significance of our result further, Figure 7 shows the depth of the\nbest fit transit curve vs. the heliocentric Vr of the HD 209458 center of mass (re-doing the\nanalysis of the r\u03bbt for each assumed Vr ). The dispersion of the waveform shown on Figure 7\nshould be the same as the average error associated with the transit curve depth (\u223c 0.14).\nThe Figure 7 dispersion is 0.22; if we use this more conservative value as the error in transit\ncurve depth, and considering the 82% efficiency of recovering the fake signal, the fiducial\nmodel is rejected at \u223c 4\u03c3 significance. The dashed line on Figure 7 shows the result from\nthe fake CO signal, which is clearly detected at the correct Vr of the system.\nOur grid of template spectra provides several ways to explore physical reasons for the\nnon-appearance of a CO transit. For example, we hypothesize a large temperature difference\nbetween the stellar-facing and anti-stellar hemispheres of the planet, with CO being absent\non the anti-stellar side. As the template lines weaken, the error level increases, because the\nsame data are being fit to smaller contrast in the template. When the error envelope, to\nsome specified level of significance, expands to include a transit depth of 0.82 (the fake signal\nrecovery level), that particular template spectrum can no longer be rejected. Setting the CO\nmixing ratio to zero on the anti-stellar side of the fiducial model produces a best fit transit\ndepth of \u22120.11 \u00b1 0.16, with the Figure 7 dispersion increasing to 0.25. This case is rejected\nat greater than 3\u03c3 significance, so removal of CO on the anti-stellar hemisphere has only a\nsmall effect on our results. The effect is small because the strong CO lines in the template\nare saturated.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nOther physical effects that could account for our result are high clouds, or decreased\ntemperature in the upper atmosphere of the planet. We have repeated our analysis over our\nentire grid of template spectra. None of the templates gives a significant detection of a CO\ntransit. We compute the maximum cloud top pressure consistent with this null detection for\neach \u03b4T , by interpolating to find where the error envelope allows a transit depth of 0.82 (the\nfake signal transit depth). We take the size of the error envelope to be three times the formal\nerror in transit depth (as in Figure 6 fits), or the maximum excursion in transit depth vs. Vr\n(as in Figure 7), whichever is greater. The maximum cloud top pressure is plotted vs. the\n\u03b4T added to the temperature profile in Figure 8. A separate relation is shown for the case\nwhen CO is absent on the anti-stellar hemisphere. Investigators who wish to make their own\nevaluation of models should use the criterion that the strong 2-0 R-branch lines between 4320\nand 4330 cm\u22121 have depths during transit less than 1.6 parts in 104 in units of the stellar\ncontinuum (3\u03c3 limit), at a spectral resolving power of 25,000. This observational criterion is\nweakly model-dependent because we derive it using a template spectrum (Figure 1) wherein\nthe relative strengths of the CO lines vary slightly with temperature.\nWater absorption has been included in one version of our model template (Figure 1,\ndotted line), and carried through our analysis as a second fake signal. To verify that water\ndoes not mask the presence of CO in our analysis, we first analyze the CO+water fake signal\nusing the template containing only CO. This analysis yields a transit depth of 0.69 \u00b1 0.14.\nThis is less than the 0.82 depth recovered from the CO-only fake signal, albeit the same within\nthe errors. Nevertheless, to guarantee maximum sensitivity to CO in the presence of water\nlines, we have analyzed the data with a full grid of CO+water templates. The CO+water\ntemplate in the fiducial model recovers the fake CO+water signal with essentially the same\nefficiency (80%) that the CO-only template recovers the CO-only fake signal (82%). We\nhave verified that our results (i.e., Figure 8) do not change significantly when the data are\nanalyzed using the CO+water template grid.\n\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur upper limit for CO is similar to the sodium detection (Charbonneau et al. 2002),\nin the sense that absorption from both Na and CO is significantly weaker than predicted by\na fiducial model with cloud tops at 0.1/e bars (=37 mbar). Several published explanations\nfor the weakness of sodium invoke some relatively specific mechanism that would not necessarily apply to CO (e.g., Barman et al. 2002). Our upper limit is interesting because fewer\nexplanations can account for the weakness of both species. One of these viable explanations\nis the presence of high clouds. To be strictly consistent in comparing with the Charbon-\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nneau et al. (2002) interpretation of their sodium observations, we must refer to the highest\ntemperature on Figure 8, \u03b4T = +200K. Charbonneau et al. (2002) followed Brown (2001)\nin using an early version of the Sudarsky et al. (2003) model that has T = 1150K in the\nupper layers, 200 Kelvins hotter than is the model published by Sudarsky et al. (2003). At\n\u03b4T = 200K, our results require a maximum cloud top pressure of 3.3 mbar (Figure 8). Using\nthe Sudarsky et al. (2003) model without perturbation increases this to 5.7 mbar. Clouds\noccur at pressures as low as 1 mbar in some models. Not only do they reproduce the sodium\nresult, they are helpful in accounting for the relatively large radius of the planet (Fortney\net al. 2003; Burrows et al. 2003). However, the high forsterite cloud discussed by Fortney et\nal. (2003) is comprised of small particles (\u2264 0.5 \u03bcm), whose visible opacity is dominated by\nscattering. At the much longer wavelength of the CO bands, scattering opacity by submicron\nparticles will be greatly reduced (an issue discused by Brown 2001), and such clouds may\nnot suffice to explain our CO result. Indeed, Burrows et al. (2004) show a spectrum (their\nFigure 1) based on data from Fortney et al. (2003), that illustrates weakened sodium, but\nstill shows prominent CO features. Cooler atmospheres would allow the IR-opaque cloud\ntops to occur at higher pressures (Figure 8), and might prove easier to reconcile with our\nresults. Note that a cooler atmosphere for HD 209458b could also explain the non-detection\nof a 2 \u03bcm continuum peak by Richardson et al. (2003b).\nIt is interesting to note that even very cool temperatures for HD 209458b still require\nopaque clouds at pressures much less (i.e., greater geometric heights) than the point where\na cloudless atmosphere becomes opaque in the tangent geometry. For example, Figure 8\nrequires cloud tops above 100 mbar even for a model 500K cooler than the Sudarsky et\nal. (2003) model. As we decrease the temperature in the Sudarsky et al. (2003) model,\nthe mixing ratio of CO becomes negligible at the greatest heights, but a significant transit\nsignature should persist from CO at higher pressures. Our null result therefore requires that\nclouds exist at an observable level in the atmosphere of HD 209458b, unless this planet is\ndramatically colder than current belief.\nWe have considered alternative interpretations of our result. Since the observed spectral\nresolution is high, a stringent requirement is that the line wavelengths be accurate. Fortunately, errors in line wavelengths are unlikely to be significant to our analysis. We inspected\nthe much higher-resolution solar atlas (Livingston and Wallace 1991), and were able to confirm wavelengths even for lines of insignificant importance to our template. For example, in\nthe solar spectrum we find the 7-5 R(59) transition at 4083.797 cm\u22121 , vs. 4083.793 cm\u22121 in\nour template (Goorvitch 1994). We also consider the possibility that the absorbing levels\nof CO are depopulated high in the planetary atmosphere, i.e., not in local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE). Note that departures from LTE are only significant as they affect the\nlower state of the absorbing transition; transit spectroscopy is insensitive to the upper state\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\npopulation. The strongest CO lines in our template are the P and R branches of the 2-0\nand 3-1 bands, so it suffices for the v = 1 level to be in LTE for our analysis to be valid.\nAyres & Wiedemann (1989) discuss the radiative and CO-H2 collisional rates for v = 1 to\nv = 0 relaxation. Using their Landau-Teller parameters for H2 collisions, we calculate that\nthe v = 1 to v = 0 collisional and radiative rates become comparable at 1 mbar. Therefore\ndepartures from LTE cannot solely explain our result, which requires weakening of CO at\ntens of mbar, where collisional rates dominate.\nWe thank the Keck support staff, particularly Randy Campbell and Grant Hill, for assistance with NIRSPEC, and we thank Dave Sudarsky and Adam Burrows for providing the\ntemperature/pressure profile of HD 209458b.
