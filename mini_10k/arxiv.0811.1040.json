INTRODUCTION\n\nFollowing formulation of a physical model\n(Draine & Lazarian 1998b, hereafter DL98), spinning dust has been invoked to explain the dustcorrelated microwave emission seen by the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) from 23-41\nGHz (de Oliveira-Costa et al. 2004; Finkbeiner 2004;\nFinkbeiner, Langston, & Minter 2004; Boughn & Pober\n2007; Dobler & Finkbeiner 2008b). Given the WMAP\ndata at 94 GHz, the dust-correlated emission at 23-41\nGHz was anomalously high to be explained by a purely\nthermal emission mechanism.\nBennett et al. (2003) attempted to obviate the inconsistency by suggesting that the first year data from\nWMAP did not require a spinning dust component to\nconstruct an internally consistent foregrounds model, so\nlong as the dust-correlated emission was actually dustcorrelated synchrotron at low frequencies. However,\nwhen the 3-year WMAP data (23-94 GHz) were combined with lower frequency data from Green Bank (8,14\nGHz; Finkbeiner, Langston, & Minter 2004), Tenerife\n(10,15 GHz; de Oliveira-Costa et al. 2004), and other\ntelescopes (19 GHz; Boughn & Pober 2007), it became\nclear that the dust-correlated emission at \u223c 20 GHz did\nnot behave spectrally like synchrotron emission, and was\ninstead consistent with a spinning dust spectrum.\nThe principal source of ambiguity in interpreting the\nlow frequency WMAP data as evidence for spinning dust\nwas that the spectrum of the dust-correlated emission\n1 Institute for Theory and Computation, Harvard-Smithsonian\nCenter for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, MS-51, Cambridge, MA\n02138 USA\n2 Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University,\nPrinceton, NJ 08544 USA\n3 gdobler@cfa.harvard.edu\n\nfalls from 23-41 GHz. The implication is that either\nthe peak in the spectrum is near or below the lowest\nWMAP band or that the emission is synchrotron, and it\nis only with data at lower frequency that the spinning\ndust spectrum is recovered. In the DL98 spinning dust\nmodels however, the peak frequency of the spinning dust\nemission varies depending on model parameters (e.g., the\ngrain size, geometry, ambient density, etc.), and at higher\ntemperatures with smaller grain size is expected to be\n\u223c 40 GHz. This regime is termed the \"warm ionized\nmedium\" (WIM, T \u223c 8000 K) in DL98 compared to\nthe \"cold neutral medium\" (CNM, T \u223c 100 K) emission\nthat peaks at \u223c 20-30 GHz and is thought to be the\nsource of the dust-correlated emission at low frequencies\nin WMAP.\nDobler & Finkbeiner (2008b, hereafter DF08b) showed\nthat the ambiguity is eliminated and that the turnover\nin the spinning dust spectrum is recoverable within the\nWMAP frequency range using H\u03b1-correlated emission as\na tracer of WIM spinning dust emission. Typically, H\u03b1\nis used as a tracer of free-free (thermal bremsstrahlung)\nemission from \u223c 104 K gas in regions where extinction\nfrom dust is minimal. However, because a map of H\u03b1 represents an emission measure (density squared integrated\nalong the line of sight) and because spinning dust emission is generated via dust grains that are spun up by\ncollisions with ions (which should also be roughly proportional to density squared integrated along the line of\nsight), the H\u03b1 emission should also spatially trace WIM\nspinning dust emission. In the analysis of DF08b, the\npeak frequency of the emission was found to be \u223c 50\nGHz, which was slightly higher than the \u223c 40 GHz predicted by DL98.\nIn this paper, we show that the evidence for spinning\ndust in the H\u03b1-correlated emission has strengthened with\n\n\f2\nthe release of the 5-year data, due to both decreased noise\nas well as corrections made to large-scale fluctuations\nthat were present in the 3-year data.\n2. TEMPLATE FITS\n\nMicrowave emission mechanisms in the WMAP frequency range can be separated into four broad categories:\nfree-free, thermal dust, spinning dust, and synchrotron\nemission.4 Free-free emission is generated by electron-ion\ncollisions which produce thermal bremsstrahlung in ionized gas; thermal dust refers to electric dipole emission\nfrom thermal fluctuations (e.g., lattice vibrations) in the\nelectric charge distribution in the grain; and spinning\ndust is electric dipole radiation from the smallest dust\ngrains which are excited into rotational modes through a\nvariety of collisional mechanisms. Synchrotron emission\nconsists of a soft component (T \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b2S with \u03b2S \u2248 3)\noriginating from supernova shock accelerated electrons\nwhich spiral around the Galactic magnetic field and a\nhard component (\u03b2 \u2248 2.5) centered on the Galactic center and extending roughly 20 degrees. This hard component has been termed the \"haze\" and its origin remains uncertain (Finkbeiner 2004; Dobler & Finkbeiner\n2008a).\nEach of these emission mechanisms is approximately\ntraced by maps of the sky at other frequencies, described\nbelow. This external information about the spatial structure of the foregrounds makes possible a multi-linear fit\nof the spectrum of each foreground. This multi-linear\nregression may be performed over the whole sky, or in\nselected regions to study the spectral variation of each\ncomponent. We now briefly describe the templates used,\nand the fitting method (see Dobler & Finkbeiner 2008a,\nfor more details).\n2.1. The templates\n\nFor fitting purposes, we distinguish between the\nsoft synchrotron component originating from supernovashock accelerated electrons, and a harder synchrotron\ncomponent in the inner Galaxy, possibly with a different\nphysical origin. Soft synchrotron emission is well traced\nby the Haslam et al. (1982) 408 MHz map. Though\nthe spectral index of this emission is expected to vary\nslightly from place to place in the sky, La Porta et al.\n(2008) showed that from 408 to 1420 MHz, T \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b2S\nwith \u03b2S \u2248 3. A similar spectral index was derived by\nPage et al. (2007) using polarization in the WMAP data.\nThe WMAP data, even in the first year, contained\nevidence of a harder synchrotron component in the inner Galaxy, which has become known as the \"haze\" because of its relatively featureless morphology (Finkbeiner\n2004). Dobler & Finkbeiner (2008a, hereafter DF08a)\ninterpret the haze as a separate physical component in\n4 Draine & Lazarian (1999) point out that if interstellar dust\ncontains an appreciable fraction of ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic\nmaterials, thermal fluctuations in the magnetization would generate appreciable amounts of magnetic dipole emission at frequencies \u03bd < 100GHz, which would be a fifth type of CMB foreground.\nHowever Cassasus et al. (2008) find that this type of emission is\ninconsistent with the morphology of cm emission from the \u03c1 Oph\ncloud, implying that magnetic materials are not abundant in interstellar dust. Thus, we do not consider it further in this paper; we\nwill use the term \"thermal\" emission to refer specifically to emission from thermal fluctuations in the electric dipole moments of\ngrains.\n\nthe template fit described in DF08a and below, and the\nspectrum of this emission was found to be T \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b2H\nwith \u03b2H \u2248 2.5. The template we use for this component is T \u221d 1/rgal where rgal is the distance from the\ngalactic center in degrees. Though systematics related\nto contamination of any CMB template by residual foregrounds leads to uncertainty in the derived soft and hard\nsynchrotron spectra, we note that neither the presence\nnor the spectrum of the haze has any significant effect\non the conclusions in this paper. For a detailed study\nof microwave synchrotron in the Galaxy see Dobler &\nFinkbeiner (2008c, in preparation).\nOur thermal dust template is the Finkbeiner, Davis,\n& Schlegel (1999, hereafter FDS99) two-component\nmodel of thermal dust, evaluated at 94 GHz. The\nFDS99 map uses column densities and temperatures from IRAS/ISSA (Wheelock et al. 1994) and\nCOBE/DIRBE (DIRBE Exp. Supp. 1995) given by\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998; SFD), constrained\nto fit COBE/FIRAS data in the microwave and sub-mm\n(FIRAS Exp. Supp. 1997). The preferred FDS99 model\n(model 8) gives I\u03bd \u221d \u03bd 1.7 B\u03bd (Tdust ). Converting this to\nantenna temperature, T \u221d \u03bd \u03b2D with \u03b2D \u2248 1.55 in the\nWMAP bands for typical Tdust values. We use the same\ntemplate for the diffuse, cold neutral medium (CNM)\nspinning dust which has a peak frequency \u223c 20 GHz.\nFor a free-free and WIM spinning dust template we\nuse the H\u03b1 map assembled by Finkbeiner (2003) using data from three surveys: VTSS (Dennison et al.\n1998), SHASSA (Gaustad et al. 2001), and WHAM\n(Haffner et al. 2003). The template is corrected for dust\nextinction assuming the dust and ionized gas are uniformly mixed along the line of sight. This approximation fails in regions of very high dust column density, so\nwe mask out regions in our fit where the SFD extinction\nat H\u03b1 is A(H\u03b1) \u2261 2.65E(B \u2212 V ) > 1 mag. Additionally, we mask out all point sources listed in the WMAP5\npoint source list as well as the LMC, SMC, M31, OrionBarnard's Loop, NGC 5090, and the HII region around\n\u03b6 Oph. This mask covers 22.2% of the sky and is shown\nin Figure 2 below. Roughly 1/4 of the masked pixels are\npoint sources.\n2.2. CMB Estimators\n\nFinally, we also need an estimator for the CMB since it\ncontributes a large variance at WMAP frequencies (and\nin fact constitutes the biggest source of noise when deriving foreground properties). We use the six CMB estimators described in DF08a and summarize their features\nin Table 1. As noted in DF08a (see also Hinshaw et al.\n2007), every CMB estimator is contaminated to varying degrees by foregrounds which leads to a systematic\nbias in the inferred foreground spectra. In the case of\n\"internal linear combination\" (ILC) type estimators, in\nwhich the WMAP maps in each band b are weighted and\nsummed with weight coefficients \u03b6b that are chosen to\napproximately cancel the foregrounds while preserving\nunity response to the CMB, the bias is proportional to\nthe chance spatial correlation of the true foregrounds (as\nopposed to the templates) with the CMB (see DF08a).\nThe spectral cross correlation coefficients given in e.g.\nFig. 5 depend on the CMB estimator used, but because\nwe fit out a CMB spectrum in the interpretation of the\ncorrelation spectra (see \u00a75), the final results for the H\u03b1-\n\n\f3\nTABLE 1\nCMB type\n\ndescription\nK\n\nILC coefficients\nKa\nQ\nV\n\nW\n\n1\npublished WMAP 5yr ILCa\nN/A\n2\nILC using WMAP 5yr Kp2 coefficients\n0.134 -0.646 -0.377 2.294 -0.405\n3\nminimum variance ILC over unmasked, fit pixels\n0.048 -0.603 0.342 0.530 0.683\n4\nWMAP W band minus (thermal dust + free-free model)\nN/A\n5\nminimum variance ILC with thermal dust model presubtracted 0.182 -0.638 0.044 0.325 1.086\nb\n6\nTOH 5yr map\nN/A\nNote. - The different types of CMB estimators used in the fits.

Template fit procedure\n\nTo infer the spectra of the individual foreground components, we use the multi-linear regression template fit\ndescribed in DF08a. We construct the template matrix P , whose columns consist of the templates described\nabove, and derive the spectrum of the template correlated emission, aib , where ai denotes the spectrum of foreground i and ab is the vector of correlation coefficients\nfor band b. For each band, we solve the matrix equation,\nP ab = wb ,\n(1)\nfor ab , where wb is the WMAP map for band b.

We also define the residual maps\nrb \u2261 wb \u2212 P ab .\nWith our template fits, the spectrum of each foreground emission component ai is left completely unconstrained, though it is assumed to be constant across the\nsky. To appropriately account for the CMB, we also force\naCMB = 1 in units of thermodynamic temperature.\n3. FOREGROUND CROSS-CORRELATION SPECTRA\n\nOur foreground spectrum fits are characterized by the\ncross-correlation coefficient a as well as the formal error in the fit in each band. These errors take into account both the noise in each WMAP band and morphological correlations between the different templates. By\nour definition of a above, the derived (cross-correlation)\nspectra are in I\u03bd units of kJy/sr per template unit -\nRayleighs for H\u03b1-correlated emission and mK for FDS99correlated emission. Both the data and templates are\nmean-subtracted over unmasked pixels to remove sensitivity to zero-point levels in the maps.\n5 The WMAP scan strategy visits some pixels, e.g. the ecliptic\npoles, far more than average. Because we are in the systematicsdominated limit, we use the average noise in each band to avoid\nover-weighting certain parts of the sky.\n\n3.1. H\u03b1 and Dust Correlated Emission\nFigure 1 shows our derived cross-correlation spectra\nfor the H\u03b1- and FDS99-correlated microwave emission\nfrom 23 to 94 GHz for our six CMB estimators. The\ndust-correlated spectrum exhibits the familiar thermal\ntail from 94 to 61 GHz and then the rise from \u223c50 to\n23 GHz from anomalous emission. While the statistical\nerror bars on the spectra are very small due to both the\nhigh sensitivity of WMAP as well as the large sky coverage (\u223c 150,000 pixels for HEALPix Nside = 128), the\nsystematic effects from the contamination of the CMB\nestimators by foregrounds are significant.\nAs identified in DF08a and DF08b, the spectrum\nof H\u03b1-correlated emission does not follow the free-free\npower law as expected. Instead, there is a bump in the\nspectrum with a peak frequency \u03bdp \u2248 40 GHz. This\nbump is present for all CMB estimators. We note that\nit cannot be generated by a contamination of the CMB\nestimator by foregrounds (since this bias has the spectrum of the CMB) and DF08b argued that this bump is\nmost easily explained by a WIM spinning dust component that is traced by the H\u03b1 map. We address both of\nthese considerations in detail below.\n3.2. Changes from 3-year to 5-year data\n\nThere are two notable differences when comparing our\nresults using the 3-year versus 5-year WMAP data. First,\nthe inferred peak frequency \u03bdp \u2248 40 GHz is significantly\nlower than the 50 GHz seen in the 3-year WMAP data\n(see DF08b). This shift in peak frequency is primarily\ndue to spurious large-scale power that was present in the\n3-year data but has been corrected in the 5-year data release. Figure 2 shows that the amplitude of these fluctuations can be quite large. In particular, the V band dipole\nis clearly apparent and has peak values from \u223c \u22127\u03bcK to\n\u223c 10\u03bcK.\nAs described above, we have mean subtracted the maps\nover unmasked pixels to perform the template fits, and\nso our results are not sensitive to zero point offsets. However if there is spurious low l power, as in the 3-year data,\nour fit results will be affected. Hinshaw et al. (2008)\npoint out that these large-scale fluctuations in the 3-year\ndata were due to imperfect characterization of the instrument gain. While the amplitudes of the fluctuations are\nnot large enough to have a significant impact on CMB\nanalyses, H\u03b1-correlated emission mechanisms (free-free\nand WIM spinning dust) are sufficiently subdominant at\nWMAP frequencies that \u223c 10\u03bcK offsets become impor-\n\n\f4\n\nFDS '99\n\nH\u03b1\n0.12\n200\nI\u03bd/T94 GHz [kJy/sr/mK]\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n0.11\n0.10\n0.09\nCMB1\nCMB2\nCMB3\nCMB4\nCMB5\nCMB6\n\n0.08\n\n0.07\n20\n\n100\n\n50\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n80 100\n\n10\n20\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n80 100\n\nFig. 1.- Cross-correlation spectra for the H\u03b1 (left), and FDS99 dust (right) templates using various estimators of the CMB anisotropy\n(see \u00a72.2). Although the formal error in the fit is small, in both cases the unknown degree of CMB contamination introduces a highly\ncovariant uncertainty. In each case, the spectra are the same up to addition of a CMB spectrum of unknown amplitude.\n\ntant. Because the 61 GHz band (V band) was the most\naffected, and because the WIM spinning dust peak frequency is in the range 30-50 GHz, it is not surprising that\nour best fit peak frequency has shifted. Had the spurious\nlow-l power been morphologically similar in all bands,\nthe peak frequency would have been similar between the\n3- and 5-year data. The problem was exacerbated by\nthe CMB estimators, which necessarily contained some\ncomplicated combination of these fluctuations.\nThe second difference between the 3- and 5-year analyses is that, for a given CMB estimator, the ILC coefficients (defined in Equation 4 below) have changed. Although this does not affect our interpretation of the fit\nresults (see \u00a75), the spectrum of H\u03b1-correlated emission\nhas also changed by more than the formal fit uncertainties. Since this is due primarily to changes in the coefficients used when constructing a CMB estimator, the\nextent of the contamination of these estimators by foregrounds has changed from year three to year five. For\nexample, in the case of a simple ILC which minimizes\nthe variance over unmasked pixels (CMB3) with respect\nto the ILC coefficients \u03b6b ,\n2\n\u2202hTILC\ni\n\u2032\n\u2202\u03b6b\n\nwhere\nTILC =\n\n\u03b6b\u2032 =\u03b6b\n\nX\n\n= 0,\n\n\u03b6b wb\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nb\n\nis the ILC map in thermodynamic mK and the ILC coefficients \u03b6b are constrained to sum to unity to preserve\nresponse to the CMB. These coefficients are sensitive not\nonly to the large-scale fluctuations mentioned above, but\nalso to the noise in the measurements themselves since\nwb = c + fb + nb , where c, fb , and nb are the CMB,\ntotal foregrounds in each band, and noise in each band\nrespectively. Thus the signal variance in the noise also\ncontributes to the determination of \u03b6b . This is illustrated\nby the limit of large measurement noise, in which case\n\nthe minimum variance linear combination would have\n\u03b6b = 1/\u03c3b2 .\n3.3. H\u03b1 as a tracer of spinning dust\n\nFor the 3-year WMAP data, DF08b presented an argument for why the H\u03b1 map should trace spinning dust\nemission at WMAP frequencies. Briefly, the H\u03b1 Rintensity\nis proportional to the emission measure (EM), n2e dl \u2261\nEM, where ne is the electron density and the integral is\nalong the line of sight. We will show below that evaluating the DL98 spectrum with parameters appropriate\nfor the WIM, the total emission is indeed roughly proportional to n2e . That is, including other (de-)excitation\nmechanisms such as plasma drag, far-infrared emission\nfrom the grains, etc., the behavior of the total emission\nwith density implies that the H\u03b1 EM map should trace a\ncomponent of the spinning dust emission in the Galaxy.\n4. SPINNING DUST MODEL\n\nIn this section, we summarize the spinning dust model\nused in our analysis of the 5-year H\u03b1- and dust-correlated\nspectra below. The model for excitation mechanisms\nand dipole moment distributions is described in detail\nin DL98. We find that the most relevant parameters are\nthe density, nH and the typical electric dipole moment of\n1 nm grains, \u03bc0 .\nWe use the updated grain size distribution given in\nDraine & Li (2007). Our grain size distribution is a\ndouble lognormal distribution characterized by a mean\nand width for the small and large grain populations -\nhai = 4 and 20\u00c5 and \u03c3a = 0.4 and 0.55 respectively\n(Draine & Li 2007). This size distribution has a lower\ncutoff of amin = 3.55\u00c5 which corresponds to Natoms = 20\nCarbon atoms. The dipole moment distribution for the\ngrains consists of three delta functions so that 50% of\nthe grains have \u03bc = \u03bc0 (a/1 nm)3/2 , 25% have \u03bc half as\nlarge, and 25% have \u03bc twice as large.\nThe spinning dust emission in the DL98 model comes\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 2.- The difference between the WMAP 5-year and 3-year data in the 5 bands. Left: WMAP5\u2212WMAP3. Updated beams and gains\nlead to differences in the plane, however large scale gradients (and in some cases dipoles) are seen in each band. Center: WMAP5\u2212WMAP3\nmasked with the pixels that are used in the multi-linear regression fit (see \u00a72). Right: WMAP5\u2212WMAP3 smoothed to 30\u25e6 FWHM and\nmasked. Here the large-scale fluctuations are clearly evident. In particular, the peaks range from \u223c \u22128 \u03bcK to \u223c 15 \u03bcK. All maps were\nmean subtracted over unmasked pixels prior to subtraction and smoothing.\n\nTABLE 2\nEnvironment\n\nnH (cm\u22123 )\n\n\u03bc0 (debye)\n\nTgas (K)\n\nTdust (K)\n\nxH\n\nxM\n\n\u03c7\n\ny\n\nWIM\n0.01-0.6\n0.5-12\n3000\n20\n0.99\n0.001\n1.0 0.0\nCNM\n5.0-40.0\n0.5-12\n100\n20\n0.0012 0.0003 1.0 0.0\nNote. - Spinning dust parameters for the \"warm ionized medium\" (WIM) and \"cold\nneutral medium\" (CNM) environments.

Increasing\nnH increases the peak frequency but changes the total power per\nH\u03b1 little. Upper right: Same, but for constant nH and varying \u03bc0 .\nDecreasing \u03bc0 also increases the peak frequency but decreases the\ntotal power per H\u03b1. Note that in this part of (nH , \u03bc0 ) parameter\nspace, the shape of the spectrum is nearly unchanged, but shifts\nin frequency and amplitude. Middle panels: Contours of the peak\nfrequency (left) and peak amplitude (right) in the (nH , \u03bc0 ) plane.\nLower panels: Same, but for CNM parameters. See the discussion\nin \u00a74 for details.\n\nin Table 2. The top two panels of Figure 3 shows example spinning dust spectra for WIM parameters while\nholding the density nH fixed while varying the characteristic dipole moment \u03bc0 and vice-versa. These spectra\nare in units of I\u03bd /IH\u03b1 , or total intensity per intensity\nat H\u03b1 with Tgas = 3000 K (our justification for using\nthis gas temperature, which is lower than the commonly\nused 8000 K, is given in \u00a75.1). For fixed \u03bc0 , as nH is\nincreased, the spectrum shifts up in frequency with very\nlittle change in overall power per H\u03b1. Since IH\u03b1 \u221d n2H\nin fully ionized environments, the total spinning dust intensity goes roughly like n2H . This point will be explored\nin more detail shortly, but it illustrates that an EM map\nlike the H\u03b1 map should trace spinning dust emission.\nFor fixed nH , as \u03bc0 is increased Figure 3 shows that the\nspectrum increases in amplitude and decreases in peak\nfrequency. This can be understood in terms of the radiated power per grain which goes as \u03bc2 : grains with larger\ndipole moments radiate away power faster and are thus\nharder to spin up leading to a lower peak frequency, but\n\nthey also emit more total power leading to an increased\namplitude.\nThe lower four panels of Figure 3 are contour plots\nshowing the effects of varying nH and \u03bc0 on the amplitude and peak frequency of the spinning dust spectrum. Contours are shown for both the WIM and CNM\nconditions. The contours of peak frequency show that,\nif the amount of dust per H is assumed unknown (i.e.,\nthe amplitude is allowed to vary), then there is a strong\ndegeneracy in the peak frequency between nH and \u03bc0 .\nThe implication of this strong degeneracy is that a measurement of the spinning dust spectrum with sparse frequency sampling that only gives information about the\npeak frequency (as is the case with the WMAP data below, see Figure 7) cannot uniquely constrain these two\nparameters. On the other hand, if the grain abundance\nis assumed known, than the degeneracy is broken and\nthe parameters are more tightly constrained.\nFigure 4 shows the behavior withRnH of the emissivity\nper EM for both the total emission, j\u03bd d\u03bd, as well as \u03bdj\u03bd\nevaluated at the five WMAP frequencies. The parameters of the WIM and CNM environments are also given\nin Table 2 while those for the reflection nebula (RN)\nand photo-dissociation region (PDR) are shown on the\nplot. In the limit of low nH , all four environments exhibit\nroughly j\u03bd \u221d nH behavior. In this limit, the dominant\nexcitation and de-excitation mechanism are absorption\nand emission of infrared photons and thus the total emission scales linearly with density. This is in contrast to\nthe argument presented in DF08b who argued that in the\nlowest density regions, the grains are in the episodic limit\nand so the total emission should scale as n2H . That argument neglected the importance of photon interactions.\nWhile the linear nH scaling persists through all densities shown here for the RN and PDR regions, the WIM\nand CNM both flatten to j\u03bd \u221d n2H behavior at nH \u223c 0.01\nand 5 cm\u22123 respectively. In this regime, the dominant\nspin up mechanism is collisions with ions and the n2H\nscaling persists for four orders of magnitude in nH for\nthe WIM (\u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 102 cm\u22123 ). As the density increases\nfurther in the CNM, the spectrum turns over and again\ngoes roughly like j\u03bd \u221d nH . At these high densities, both\nspin up and damping are dominated by thermal processes\n(collisions with ions and atoms). However, it is interesting to note that over the density ranges shown in Table 2,\nboth the WIM and CNM models scale as n2H indicating\nthat a map that scales with EM like the H\u03b1 map should\ntrace WIM and CNM spinning dust emission.\n5. THREE COMPONENT FOREGROUND SPECTRA\n\nGiven that the H\u03b1 map should trace both the freefree and a spinning dust emission component, and given\nthe fact that our foreground spectra are necessarily contaminated by a component with the spectrum of the\nCMB (flat in thermodynamic \u2206T ) from the CMB crosscorrelation bias described in DF08a and \u00a72, we interpret\nthe H\u03b1-correlated emission in Figure 1 as a three component spectrum.

We allow D0 to float in the fit because of uncertainty about the PAH size distribution and abundance\nin the WIM. We concentrate on CMB5, but our results\nare minimally changed for the other CMB estimators, it\nis only the value of C0 which is significantly affected.\n5.1. H\u03b1-Correlated Emission\n\nFigure 5 shows the results of our three component fit\nfor the H\u03b1-correlated emission. From the figure, it is\nclear that a spinning dust spectrum with nH and \u03bc0 set to\n0.15 cm\u22123 and 3.5 debye respectively (and with the WIM\nparameters in Table 2) fits the data remarkably well.\nThis value for \u03bc0 is comparable to the earlier estimates in\nDL98. This spectrum has a peak frequency of \u03bdp = 37.2\nGHz and D0 fit coefficient of 0.34. It is interesting to note\nthat the value of D0 is less than unity. This may indicate\neither that PAHs are depleted in the diffuse WIM by a\nfactor of \u223c 3 or that the grain size distribution differs\nfrom that in the CNM from which the values of the lognormal mean and width of our grain size distribution\n\n\fI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n8\nFull Sky Fit\nF+D+C model\nfree-free\nspinning dust\nCMB bias\n\n0.10\nTgas = 2889 K\n\nnH = 0.15 cm-3\n\u03bc0 = 3.5 debye\n\n0.01\n0.11\n0.10\n20\n\n40\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFig. 5.- Upper: The H\u03b1-correlated spectrum from 23 to 94\nGHz (points) using CMB5 and the three-component fit to the data\n(dashed line). The three components, free-free, spinning dust, and\nCMB, are shown separately. The amplitude of the free-free component yields Tgas \u2248 3000 K, while the amplitude of the spinning dust\ncomponent is less than unity indicating that either PAHs are depleted in the WIM or the grain size distribution is altered. Lower:\nA zoom in of the spectrum showing that, although the bump is\nsubtle, the statistical significance is very high.\n\nwere derived (Draine & Li 2007).\nFrom the amplitude of the F0 fit coefficient, we can\nderive a gas temperature in the WIM which we find to\nbe Tgas \u2248 3000 K. This is the origin of the choice of Tgas\nin the WIM spinning dust model. This value for Tgas is\nmuch lower than the temperature inferred from emission\nline ratios (e.g., see Madsen et al. 2006). We stress that\nthis low gas temperature is not the result of assigning\nsome of the intensity to a spinning dust component. Ignoring the bump and merely fitting the data with a freefree only spectrum, still gives a gas temperature below\n5000K. Using a technique similar to ours, Davies et al.\n(2006) also report anomalously low gas temperatures\nbased on the free-free to H\u03b1 ratio in the WMAP 1-year\ndata and DF08b found similar temperatures in the 3-year\ndata. The origin of this discrepancy is unclear, though\nit may result from temperature variations in the WIM\nalong the line of sight as discussed in Heiles (2001).7 We\nwill explore implications of a two-component temperature model in future work. Lastly, we find that the total intensity in H\u03b1-correlated spinning dust emission is\nroughly 25% of that in free-free emission at 41 GHz.\nThe upper panel in Figure 5 shows that the bump in\nthe spectrum is indeed subtle, but the zoom in beneath\nreveals that it is highly statistically significant. Since\nwe minimize \u03c72 over three amplitudes (F0 , D0 , and C0 ),\nset the values of nH and \u03bc0 by hand, and fit to five data\npoints, the number of degrees of freedom is formally zero.\nHowever, Figures 6 and 7 show that the \u03c72 rises quickly\nas we deviate from these parameters. In the left panel\n7 Another possibility is that our template fit of the spectrum\nis dominated by the strongest H\u03b1 features which naturally have a\nlower temperature.\n\nof Figure 6, \u2206\u03c72 contours are shown in the (D0 , C0 )\nplane and it is clear that the null hypothesis that the\nH\u03b1-correlated emission is simply a linear combination of\nfree-free plus a CMB bias (i.e., D0 = 0), is ruled out at\nvery high confidence. In fact we find that the D0 = 0\ncase is ruled out at \u223c 27\u03c3. The right panel shows \u03c72\ncontours in the (D0 , \u03bdp ) plane as \u03bdp is varied by hand.\nThis parameter is less well constrained but is broadly\nconsistent with \u03bdp \u223c 35-40 GHz.\nFigure 7 shows \u03c72 and D0 contours in the (nH , \u03bc0 )\nplane for the full-sky fit. The \u03c72 contours show that\nthere is a long narrow valley in the \u03c72 surface reflecting\nthe degeneracy in peak frequency shifts resulting from\nvarying nH and \u03bc0 (see Figure 3). Since varying \u03bc0 affects the overall amplitude of the spinning dust component in units of I\u03bd /IH\u03b1 while nH does not (because of the\ndensity squared behavior of the spinning dust emission\nat these nH ), the value of D0 changes as we move along\nthe narrow valley of the \u03c72 surface. It is important to\nnote that small deviations from these parameters quickly\nlead to large \u03c72 values. Further, given this set of environmental conditions and grain sizes, D0 = 1 is ruled out;\nagain, implying either PAH depletion or modified grain\nsize distributions in the WIM.\n5.2. The Gum Nebula\n\nIn addition to our nearly full sky template fit, we have\nalso carried out smaller regional fits. Of particular interest are the four regions of the Gum Nebula shown in\nFigure 4 of DF08b. This is a region that is very bright\nin H\u03b1 but has little in the way of thermal dust emission\nor synchrotron. The null hypothesis is that the spectrum of this region should correspond almost entirely to\na free-free spectrum.\nFigure 8 shows the three component model fit as well\nas the contour plots for the four regions of the Gum Nebula. The bump in the H\u03b1-correlated spectrum persists\nfor all four regions, though the spinning dust amplitudes\nD0 and CMB correlation bias amplitudes C0 vary slightly\nfrom region to region. There is some evidence that the\npeak frequency \u03bdp also varies slightly from region to region, but it is the least well constrained parameter and\nall four regions indicate roughly \u03bdp \u223c 35-45 GHz. From\nthe \u2206\u03c72 contours in the (D0 , C0 ) plane, we find that the\nnull hypothesis of D0 = 0 is ruled out at high confidence\nin all regions.\nDue to the larger error bars in the template fit (the\nsmaller regions include fewer pixels), the \u03c72 valley in the\n(nH , \u03bc0 ) plane is somewhat broader than in the full sky\nfit. Nevertheless, all of the spectra are consistent with\na WIM spinning dust spectrum with nH \u223c 0.1 cm\u22123 ,\n\u03bc0 \u223c 2 debye, and D0 \u223c 0.4.\n5.3. Thermal Dust-Correlated Emission\nAs shown in Figure 1, dust-correlated emission falls\nfrom 23 GHz to 60 GHz and it was this departure from a\nthermal spectrum which initially lead to speculation that\nthis \"anomalous\" dust component originated from spinning grains. In this section, we fit our three component\nmodel to this data but replace the WIM spinning dust\nmodel in Equation 5 with a CNM spinning dust model\nand the free-free component with a thermal dust spectrum T = T0 \u00d7 (\u03bd/94 GHz)\u03b2D . We choose \u03b2D = 1.7 but\n\n\f9\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206\u03c72 = 1,2,3,4,5\n\n70\n\u03bdpeak [GHz]\n\n0.1\n\nC0\n\n\u03c72 = 1,2,5,10,20\n\n80\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n\n-0.2\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nD0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nD0\n\n1\n50.00.0\n.3\n01..50\n\nFig. 6.- Left: \u2206\u03c72 contours in the (D0 , C0 ) plane.

There is a deep narrow valley in the \u03c72 surface\nrepresenting the near degeneracy in effects on the spinning dust\npeak frequency model with increasing nH and decreasing \u03bc0 . The\nvalues nH = 0.15cm\u22123 and \u03bc0 = 3.5 debye produce an acceptable\nfit with D0 \u2248 0.3. Although D0 does vary along the narrow valley\nin \u03c72 , D0 = 1 does not yield an acceptable fit, indicating that either\nthe PAHs are depleted in the WIM or the grain size distribution is\naltered.\n\nnote that our results are not significantly changed for the\nrange 1.5 < \u03b2D < 2.\nThe left hand panel in Figure 9 shows the results\nof fitting a CNM spinning model to the WMAP dustcorrelated spectrum. The spinning dust model has nH =\n11 cm\u22123 and \u03bc0 = 5.5 debye. From the figure, it is clear\nthat this particular spinning dust spectrum is not a very\n\ngood fit to the data (\u03c72 = 50.5), especially considering\nthat there are few free parameters. However, the right\nhand panel of Figure 9 indicates that, although the amplitude is approximately correct (T0 \u2248 1.0), for the CNM\nparameters there is no point in parameter space which\nyields a significantly better fit.\nThe poor fit is due to the fact that the 23,\n33, and 41 GHz data points exhibit roughly powerlaw behavior (T \u221d \u03bd \u22122.83 ) so that the spinning\ndust spectrum has too much curvature to fit the\ndata. This powerlaw behavior has lead several authors to misidentify this emission as \"dust-correlated\nsynchrotron\", however both WMAP polarization data\n(Kogut et al. 2007) and data at lower frequencies\nover large areas (Finkbeiner, Langston, & Minter 2004;\nde Oliveira-Costa et al. 2004) argue strongly against the\nsynchrotron hypothesis. Furthermore, we note that,\nalong any line of sight, there may very well be regions\nwith different environment and grain properties leading\nto a superposition of spinning dust spectra. This degeneracy between synchrotron and a superposition of spinning dust spectra can only be broken with sufficient frequency coverage. In particular full-sky, high-resolution\nmaps between 5 and 15 GHz could eliminate the ambiguity.\nLastly, we point out that the anomalous dustcorrelated emission in the CNM could originate from\nan emission mechanism that is neither synchrotron nor\nspinning dust. For example, Draine & Lazarian (1999)\nsuggest that emission from magnetized dust grain could\ncontribute to the total emission in the lower frequency\nWMAP bands. However, in the case of the WIM, the\nfact that the H\u03b1 map and the DL98 spinning dust models both scale roughly as density squared suggests that\nthe bump in the H\u03b1-correlated emission originates from\nspinning dust and not DL99 magnetic dust. Furthermore, the observations of Cassasus et al. (2008) appear\n\n\f10\n0.20\n0.18\n\n0.20\n0.18\n\nGum Nebula Region 3\nF+D+C model\n\n0.16\n\n0.16\n\n0.14\n\n0.14\n\n0.14\n\n0.14\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n0.1\n\n50\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n.0\n\n5\n4\n\n0.4\n\n5.0\n\n1.0\n\n.0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n0.5\n1.0\n\n5.0\n.0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0.10.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.10\nnH [cm-3]\n\n1\n0.01\n\n0.7\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.10\nnH [cm-3]\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0.01\n\n5.0\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\n.0\n\n0.5\n\n5.0\n\n1\n0.01\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n3\n\n0.10.3\n0.5\n\n0.7\n.0\n10\n\n5.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\n.0\n\n0.10.3\n\n0.7\n\n0.10\nnH [cm-3]\n\n0.2\n\n0.7\n\n1\n0.01\n\n10\n\n1.0\n5.0\n\n0.5\n5.0\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n.0\n10\n\n2\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n3\n\n0.5\n\n0.7 0 0\n.5\n\n.3\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\n0.5\n1.0\n1.0\n0.5\n\n5.0\n\n.0\n0.7\n10\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\n.0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\nD0\n\n10\n\n.0\n\n5.0\n\n0.4\n\n0\n0.5.3 0.1\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n0.3\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n10\n.0\n50..03\n\n0.3\n5.0\n\n50\n\n30\n0.2\n\n5\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n4\n\n60\n\n40\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n5.0\n\n0.5\n\n.0\n10\n\n5\n\n0.5 0.3 0\n\n0.5\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c72 = 1,2,5,10,20\n\n80\n\nD0\n\n0.3\n\n.1\n\n5\n\n50\n\nD0\n\n1.0\n\nD0\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n70\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.9\n\n5.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\nD0\n\n40\n\n30\n0.4\n\n-0.2\n0.1\n\n\u03bdpeak [GHz]\n\n60\n\n40\n\n30\n\n0.6\n\n.0\n\n40\n\n0.5\n\n70\n\u03bdpeak [GHz]\n\n\u03bdpeak [GHz]\n\n50\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c72 = 1,2,5,10,20\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\nD0\n\n\u03c72 = 1,2,5,10,20\n\n80\n\n70\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nD0\n\n\u03c72 = 1,2,5,10,20\n\n80\n\n0.5\n\n.0\n5.0\n\nD0\n\n0.4\n\n10\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n1.0\n\n-0.2\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\n0.6\n\n80 100\n\n\u2206\u03c72 = 1,2,3,4,5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nC0\n\n0.0\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n0.1\n\n0.7\n\n0.3\n\n0.06\n20\n\n\u2206\u03c72 = 1,2,3,4,5\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n80 100\n\n0.1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n0.1\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206\u03c72 = 1,2,3,4,5\n\nC0\n\nC0\n\n-0.1\n\n\u03bdpeak [GHz]\n\n0.06\n20\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n80 100\n\n\u03c72= 0.388\nF0= 1.088\nD0= 0.34\nC0= 0.112\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206\u03c72 = 1,2,3,4,5\n\n0.1\n\nC0\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n0.10\n\n0.5\n\n0.06\n20\n\n0.12\n\n0.08\n\n5.0\n\n0.2\n\n80 100\n\n0.08\n\n1.0\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n\u03c72= 0.911\nF0= 1.396\nD0= 0.40\nC0= 0.121\n\nGum Nebula Region 4\nF+D+C model\n\n10\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n.0\n\n0.06\n20\n\n\u03c72= 0.747\nF0= 1.016\nD0= 0.32\nC0= 0.109\n\n10\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c72= 2.199\nF0= 1.021\nD0= 0.39\nC0= 0.127\n\n0.12\n\n5.0\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n0.5\n\n0.12\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n0.16\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n0.16\n\n1.0\n0.3\n\nGum Nebula Region 2\nF+D+C model\n\n0.7 5.0\n\n0.20\n0.18\n\nGum Nebula Region 1\nF+D+C model\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n0.20\n0.18\n\n0.10\nnH [cm-3]\n\nFig. 8.- The same as Figures 5, 6, and 7 except for the four regions of the Gum Nebula defined and illustrated in Dobler & Finkbeiner\n(2008b).

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE\nH\u03b1-CORRELATED BUMP\n\nIn this section we will address alternative explanations\nfor the origin of the bump in the H\u03b1-correlated emission. The alternatives listed here are not meant to be\nan exhaustive list of possibilities but rather constitute\npotentially important features of the maps, our fitting\nprocedure, etc., and thus require careful attention about\nwhether they can artificially generate a bump in our spectrum. For each of these, we argue why the bump is more\nlikely to be explained by spinning dust.\n6.1. Bandpass Effects\n\nAlthough the spectra presented in previous sections\nconsisted of five data points, the individual channels of\nWMAP have broad (\u2206\u03bd/\u03bd \u2248 0.2) bandpasses that must\nbe taken into account. For a given emission mechanism,\nthe total intensity in a WMAP channel is the spectrum\nof that emission integrated over the bandpass of that\nchannel,\nR\nI\u03bd \u03c9(\u03bd)d\u03bd\ntot\nIb = R\n,\n(6)\n\u03c9(\u03bd)d\u03bd\n\nwhere Ibtot is the total intensity in band b and\nR \u03c9(\u03bd) is the\nbandpass for band b normalized so that \u03c9(\u03bd)d\u03bd \u2261 1.\nThus, for a free-free spectrum (I\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.15 ), the observed spectrum will be slightly modified from a straight\npowerlaw when plotted against the CMB weighted band\ncenters (see below). We find that the deviations are at\n\n\f11\n\n5\n\n0.3\n\n0\n20 100\n0\n6\n\n0\n6010 0\n20\n\n100\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\nI\u03bd/T94 GHz [kJy/sr/mK]\n\n0.\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n10\n\nFull Sky Fit\nT+S+C model\nthermal dust\nspinning dust\nCMB bias\n\n100\n\n0.9\n\n6000\n1 0\n20\n\n9\n07. 5\n00.00.3..1\n\n10\n20\n\n1\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n10\nnH [cm-3]\n\n80 100\n\nFig. 9.- Left: A three component model fit to the FDS99-correlated emission spectrum from 23 to 94 GHz. The fit includes a thermal\ndust component (T \u221d \u03bd 1.7 ), a CNM spinning dust component (nH = 11cm\u22123 and \u03bc0 = 5.5 debye; see Table 2), and a CMB component.\nClose inspection reveals that the curvature in this single component spinning dust spectrum is incompatible with the data and over-predicts\nthe amplitude at 61 GHz. Right: The same as Figure 7 except for CNM parameters and fitting to FDS99-correlated emission. Although\nthe amplitude is roughly D0 = 1, the \u03c72 values are unacceptably high. In fact, for the model in the left hand panel, \u03c72 = 50.5. Thus, for\nreasonable CNM parameters, a single component DL98 spinning dust model is ruled out at high confidence.\n\nwhere the spectrum of the CMB I\u03bdCMB \u221d \u03bd 2 plc(\u03bd) (i.e.,\nflat in thermodynamic \u2206T ).

Dust Extinction and Masking Effects\n\nIt has long been known that, although a map of H\u03b1\nis an excellent tracer of free-free emission from ionized\ngas, it is not perfect. In particular, extinction of H\u03b1 by\ndust makes the map a poor tracer of free-free in regions of\nhigh dust column density. To account for this Finkbeiner\n(2003) (whose map we have used in this paper) apply a\ndust correction which assumes uniform mixing between\nthe dust and gas. Dickinson et al. (2003) take a slightly\ndifferent approach by matching slices through the galactic plane to an extinction model plus dust column density\nmodel and attempting to directly measure the extinction.\nThe effects of dust on the H\u03b1 map could manifest\nthemselves in two ways. First, recall that our mask is\ngenerated by avoiding regions where the extinction due\nto dust at H\u03b1 is E(B \u2212 V ) > 1 mag. It is difficult to\n8 By design the WMAP receivers measure energy and so the\nR\nnatural data unit is I\u03bd d\u03bd, however since they are then calibrated\noff of the CMB dipole, the data are presented in thermodynamic\n\u2206T .\n\n0.07\n20\n\nE(B-V) = 0.5 / 2.65\nE(B-V) = 1.0 / 2.65\nE(B-V) = 1.5 / 2.65\nE(B-V) = 2.0 / 2.65\n\n40\n60\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n80 100\n\nFig. 10.- Foreground spectra derived via our multi-linear\nregression template fit as a function of the extinction cut used\nfor the mask. The bump in the H\u03b1-correlated emission persists\nfor all mask definitions indicating that it is not due to improperly\ncorrected extinction in the H\u03b1 map.\n\nenvision that our mask could have a sufficiently large\nimpact on our derived spectrum to produce the bump,\nbut it is instructive to consider the possibility. In Figure 10 we show the derived H\u03b1-correlated spectrum for\na wide range of dust cuts (i.e., for numerous masks). As\ncan be seen in the figure, the bump feature is robust to\nvariations in the mask.\nThe second potential issue is that perhaps the H\u03b1 map\n\n\f12\nhas been over corrected for dust so that it is actually a\nrather poor tracer of free-free, potentially leading to the\nbump as a spurious artifact. To test this hypothesis, we\nperformed our template fit with an H\u03b1 map that was not\ncorrected for dust extinction at all. Even in this extreme\ncase of under -correction, we find that the bump persists.\nWe conclude that the bump does not result from errors\nin the extinction correction of the H\u03b1 map.\n6.3. CMB Cross-Correlation Bias\n\nThe CMB cross-correlation bias described above (and\nmore extensively in DF08a) is both large and ubiquitous\nin CMB foreground analyses. Because the effect on the\nderived spectrum of each component can be substantial,\nit is important to rule out the possibility that this bias\nis producing the bump. This possibility represents the\n\"null hypothesis\" discussed in \u00a75.1. The basic question\nis, can the derived cross-correlation spectrum be fit by\na simple linear combination of free-free and CMB spectra? As we showed in that section, this D0 = 0 case is\nruled out at very high confidence with a \u03c72 per degree\nof freedom of 245 (for 3 degrees of freedom at D0 = 0).\n6.4. Cross-Correlation Between the Templates\nIf there is any chance spatial cross-correlation between\nthe templates, than this will impact the shape of the derived spectra. Furthermore, if one of the templates is\ncontaminated by H\u03b1 morphology or vice-versa, than the\nspectrum of each foreground will be \"contaminated\" by\nthe others. Again, a clear example of this would be poor\ndust correction of the H\u03b1 map adding dust-like morphology to that map. Another example would be reflection\nof H\u03b1 photons created in the plane off of dust at high\nlatitudes, which would also imprint a dust-like morphology on the H\u03b1 map. There is also the fact that the WIM\nemits thermal radiation as well and so there is some H\u03b1\nmorphology present in the FDS99 map.\nDF08b showed that the chance spatial crosscorrelations between the templates used in the analysis\nis sufficiently small that there should be relatively little\ncontamination of one foreground spectrum onto another.\nWe explore this point in greater detail in Appendix A,\nwhere we specifically address the fact that WIM features\nappear at a low level in the dust map.\n6.5. Variations of Tgas with Position\n\nGas temperatures in the interstellar medium are known\nto vary with position. For example, there is evidence that\nthere is a decrease in Tgas towards the Galactic center\n(Quireza et al. 2006). However, even though relatively\nsmall variations in Tgas lead to large changes in the H\u03b1\nto free-free ratio, the effect is simply an amplitude shift\n(Valls-Gabaud 1998). Thus, when we fit the nearly full\nsky, we are averaging over many regions with slightly\ndifferent amplitudes, but all with spectra \u221d \u03bd \u22120.15 . Thus,\nour resultant spectrum should be \u221d \u03bd \u22120.15 indicating\nthat a superposition of many regions with varying Tgas\nwould not produce a bump in the average spectrum.\n6.6. Model Independent Identification of the Anomalous\n\nEmission\nRather than attempting to address every possible contamination mechanism that could result in a bump in\n\nthe H\u03b1-correlated spectrum, it is possible to identify the\nbump without the use of any template fitting and only\nusing the WMAP data. The top two panels of Figure\n11 show the WMAP data at 23 GHz (with CMB5 subtracted) as well as the H\u03b1 map. We identify two regions\nthat are bright in H\u03b1 and also bright at K band (23\nGHz): \u03b6 Oph near (l, b) = (6, 23) degrees and the Gum\nNebula near l = 260 and \u221222 < b < 17 degrees . If the\nH\u03b1 map traces only free-free emission, then subtracting\nK band scaled by a free-free spectrum from Ka, Q, V,\nand W band should completely eliminate these features.\nThe bottom grid in Figure 11 shows K band in the left\nmost column and then the result of subtracting K band\nscaled by a free-free spectrum from Ka, Q, V, and W\nbands (columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively) for both the\nGum Nebula region (row 1) and the \u03b6 Oph region (row\n2). Since the spectrum of free-free is harder than synchrotron and softer than thermal dust, synchrotron emission is highly over-subtracted and thermal dust emission\nis under-subtracted (note the prominence of thermal dust\nemission in column 5). What we find is that with a freefree spectrum, there is a clear excess in the southern\nGum Nebula region and particularly in \u03b6 Oph. The implication is that, \u03b6 Oph and the Gum Nebula contain\nan emission component which is harder than free-free\nfrom 23 GHz to 41 GHz, but softer than free-free from\n41 GHz to 94 GHz. Furthermore, this spectrum is not\nsoft enough at 23-61 GHz to be synchrotron, yet is vastly\nbrighter than the expected thermal dust emission, so it\ncannot be any of the standard foreground components.\nRather, it has a spinning dust type spectrum with peak\nfrequency near \u223c 40 GHz.\n7. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have repeated the multi-linear regression template\nfit outlined in Dobler & Finkbeiner (2008a, DF08a) on\nthe 5-year WMAP data and found that the anomalous\n\"bump\" at \u223c 40 GHz in the H\u03b1-correlated emission spectrum persists and has in fact become more pronounced.\nThe most significant changes in the spectrum from 3-year\nto 5-year data come from large scale modes (particularly\na large dipole at 61 GHz V band) of amplitude \u223c 10 \u03bcK\nthat were corrected in the 5-year data.\nWe interpret this bump as a \"warm ionized medium\"\n(WIM) spinning dust component that is traced by the\nH\u03b1 map. We find that for WIM parameters, the total spinning dust emission per grain scales roughly as\nthe ambient ionized gas density squared (see Figure\n4).\nR\nTherefore, a map of emission measure (EM = n2e dl)\nlike the H\u03b1 map would be expected to trace this component.\nAny derived foreground spectrum is subject to the\nCMB correlation bias (see DF08a) from chance spatial\ncorrelations of the foreground emission with the CMB.\nThus, we fit a three component model consisting of freefree, WIM spinning dust, and CMB spectra to the derived H\u03b1-correlated emission in which the amplitude of\neach component is allowed to float. The best fit model\ngives a value for the ion density of the ambient medium\nof nH \u223c 0.15 cm\u22123 and a characteristic dipole moment\nfor the grains of \u223c 3.5 debye referenced to 1 nm grains.\nHowever, there is a strong degeneracy between these two\nparameters as they have similar effects on the peak frequency.\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 11.- Top left: WMAP K band minus CMB5. Top right: The H\u03b1 map. First column: A cut out of K band around the Gum\nNebula (row 1) and \u03b6 Oph (row 2). Second through fifth column: K band subtracted from Ka, Q, V, and W bands using a free-free \u03bd \u22122.15\nspectrum. Clearly there is residual emission in both the southern Gum Nebula and the \u03b6 Oph cloud using a free-free spectrum indicating\nthe need for a separate component. This component is harder than free-free from 23 to 41 GHz and softer than free-free from 41 to 94\nGHz, which is indicative of a spinning dust spectrum. Although there are significant regions of over-subtraction (due to the substantial\nsynchrotron component at low frequencies), the H\u03b1-correlated emission is clearly under-subtracted by a free-free spectrum.\n\nThe amplitude of the spinning dust spectrum must be\nreduced by a factor \u223c 0.3 compared to the model to fit\nthe data, possibly indicating that PAHs are depleted in\nthe WIM. From the amplitude coefficient of the free-free\ncomponent, we use the H\u03b1 to free-free ratio to infer a gas\ntemperature of \u223c 3000 K. Near the peak frequency at 41\nGHz, the total spinning dust emission is roughly 20% of\nthe free-free emission. We also find that the bump persists in smaller regional fits of the Gum Nebula as well\nwith roughly the same amplitude. There is some evidence that the peak frequency varies with region, but this\nparameter is the most poorly constrained in our analysis.\nAs in numerous other studies, we also find the now familiar rise in the thermal dust -correlated spectrum from\n41 to 23 GHz from anomalous dust-correlated emission.\nAn attempt to fit a three component model of thermal\ndust, \"cold neutral medium\" (CNM) spinning dust, and\nCMB spectra to the dust-correlated emission yields a\npoor fit. However, we expect that, along any line of sight,\nthere will be multiple regions with different environmental properties so that the low frequency dust-correlated\nemission may represent a superposition of spinning dust\nspectra. Although other possibilities exist for this emission (magnetic dust and \"dust-correlated synchrotron\"\nbeing two), we point out that since the H\u03b1 map is a density squared map, and since WIM spinning dust emission goes roughly as density squared, we believe it is\nvery likely that the bump in the H\u03b1-correlated emission\nrepresents a spinning dust component. Magnetic dust\n\nemission would not correlate with H\u03b1 in this way.\nWe have shown that the bump cannot be explained\nby numerous possible systematic uncertainties in our fit.\nFor example, the bump cannot be the result of the CMB\ncorrelation bias because a fit to the spectrum with a two\ncomponent free-free plus CMB model yields a very bad\n\u03c72 = 740 with three degrees of freedom. It also cannot\nbe due to poor correction for dust extinction of the H\u03b1\nmap since the bump persists even if the template fit is\nperformed with a completely uncorrected map, nor is it\nsensitive to our choice of mask for which we cut on dust\nextinction of H\u03b1. Variations in gas temperature with position and cross-correlation between the templates used\nin the fit are also incapable of producing the bump.\nPerhaps the most striking visualization that the bump\nis not an artifact of the fitting procedure is by subtracting\nthe K band WMAP data scaled with a free-free spectrum\nfrom Ka, Q, V, and W bands. This reveals that in regions that are very bright in K band and H\u03b1 which were\nthought to be completely free-free dominated at these\nfrequencies (e.g., the Gum Nebula and \u03b6 Oph), there is\na positive residual at 33, 41, and 61 GHz. Scaling by a\nfree-free plus bump spectrum instead removes the residual. The implication is that there is emission coming\nfrom these regions that has a spectrum that is harder\nthan free-free from 23-41 GHz and then softer than freefree from 41-94 GHz, which resembles a spinning dust\nspectrum.\nThe interpretation of the dust-correlated anomalous\n\n\f14\nemission as spinning dust (or magnetic dust) has been\nplagued by the fact that ancillary data sets at lower frequencies are needed to distinguish that emission from\nsynchrotron. Here we have shown that a turnover in the\nspinning dust spectrum is completely recoverable within\nthe WMAP frequency range. The only surprise is that\nit correlates with the H\u03b1 map. In hindsight, this is not\nvery surprising since the H\u03b1 map traces density squared\nemission, though it does suggest that there is no \"true\"\ntemplate for the spinning dust. Rather, it is potentially\nubiquitous and probably will not correlate precisely with\nany map of the sky.\n\nCassasus, Clive Dickinson, Joanna Dunkley, Ben Gold,\nGary Hinshaw, Al Kogut, and David Spergel.

IMPERFECT TEMPLATE MORPHOLOGY\n\nHere we consider the effects of \"contaminating\" one of the templates with another, and determine the effects on\nthe resultant spectra. We phrase this in terms of a template (denoted with primes) and a \"true\" map that perfectly\ntraces the emission for the component we're solving for. We consider two cases. First, we consider that the H\u03b1 map is\nnot a perfect tracer of free-free emission and show that this does not mix the spectrum of other foregrounds into the\nH\u03b1-correlated spectrum. That is, the bump in the spectrum is not due to contamination effects from other foreground\nspectra. Second, we consider the case in which the dust template, FDS99, is tracing both a CNM and WIM spinning\ndust component at low frequencies. This case does have an impact on the spectrum, but we show that it cannot\nproduce the observed bump and that it does not significantly impact our main conclusions.\n\n\f15\n\nFig. 12.- An illustration of the contamination of FDS99 by H\u03b1 morphology. The left panel shows the FDS99 dust map centered on\nthe Gum Nebula ({l, b} = {260, 0}, a strong H\u03b1 feature). The top middle panel shows the best fit FDS99 = \u01eb0 L + \u03b40 H where L is a map\nof H I emission and H is the H\u03b1 map. The top right panel shows that the difference between the model and the FDS99 map contains\nvery little H\u03b1 morphology (lower right panel). Nevertheless, the effect is subtle as shown in the residual plus \u03b40 H map in the lower middle\npanel. Our fit of the level of contamination of the FDS99 map by H\u03b1 morphology is \u03b40 \u223c 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R.\n\n0.16\n\n0.14\n\n0.14\n\n5\n\n0.1\n\n0.16\n\n0.3\n\n0.18\n\n01.3\n5.00.0\n01..50\n\nH\u03b1-correlated Emission\n\nH\u03b1-correlated Emission\n0.18\n\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n100\n\n.0\n10\n\n5.0\n\n0.\n\n5\n\n1.0\n\n10.0 5.0\n.5\n\n.0\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n0.0.3\n\n\u03b4 = 10e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 8e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 6e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 4e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 2e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 0e-5 [mK/R]\n\n\u03bd [GHz]\n\n100\n\n1\n0.01\n\n7\n\n0.\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.\n\n0.08\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.10\n\n3\n\n0\n10\n.\n\n0.08\n\n\u03b4 = 10e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 8e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 6e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 4e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 2e-5 [mK/R]\n\u03b4 = 0e-5 [mK/R]\n\n0.12\n\n5.\n\n0.10\n\n3\n\n0.\n\n0\n0.7 .5\n\n0.12\n\n\u03bc0 [debye]\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\nI\u03bd/IH\u03b1 [kJy/sr/R]\n\n4\n\n0.10\nnH [cm-3]\n\nFig. 13.- Left: the spectrum of H\u03b1-correlated emission using FDS99 \u2212 \u03b4 \u00d7 H\u03b1 as a CNM template for various values of \u03b4. Note that\n\u03b4 \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R is roughly required to appropriately remove H\u03b1 morphology from FDS99 as shown in Figure 12. As expected, as \u03b4\nis increased, the spectrum from Figure 5 is contaminated with FDS99-correlated spectrum in Figure 9 (see text, Equation A8). Middle:\nthe spectrum of H\u03b1-correlated emission assuming that FDS99 exactly traces thermal dust emission with Tdust = FDS99 \u00d7 (\u03bd/94 GHz)1.7 .\nFor \u03b4 = 0 mK/R, the bump in the H\u03b1-correlated spectrum represents the difference of WIM and CNM spectra, for \u03b4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R,\nthe spectrum is almost entirely WIM, and as \u03b4 is increased further, the bump represents an addition of WIM plus increasingly more CNM\nspectra. Indeed, the peak frequency moves to the lower CNM value as \u03b4 gets large. Right: The \u03c72 (dashed) and D0 contours in the (nH , \u03bc0 )\nplane for the spectrum shown in the middle panel with \u03b4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R. With this small level of contamination, our results for the\nbest fit nH , \u03bc0 , and D0 values are almost completely unchanged (cf., Figure 7).\n\nA.1. H\u03b1 as an imperfect tracer of free-free\n\nFor the template fits the equation we are trying to solve, neglecting the CMB and the associated cross correlation\nbias and considering only two foregrounds, is\na1 H \u2032 + a2 D = t1 H + t2 D,\n\n(A1)\n\nfor a1 and a2 , where H is the true H\u03b1 map which we assume exactly traces free-free emission, D is the dust map, t1 and\nt2 are the true amplitudes (at an arbitrary frequency), and H \u2032 is the observed H\u03b1 map (which may be contaminated\nin some way).\nBy multiplying Equation A1 by H \u2032 and solving for a1 , we obtain\na 1 = t1\n\nhDH \u2032 i\nhDH \u2032 i\nhHH \u2032 i\n+ t2\n\u2212 a2\n\u20322\n\u20322\nhH i\nhH i\nhH \u20322 i\n\n(A2)\n\n\f16\nand likewise by multiplying by D and solving for a2 we find\na 2 = t2 + t1\n\nhDH \u2032 i\nhDHi\n\u2212 a1\n.\n2\nhD i\nhD2 i\n\n(A3)\n\nTo show that the H\u03b1-correlated emission spectrum is not affected by the spectrum of the dust-correlated emission, we\nneed to show that a1 6= a1 (a2 , t2 ). Plugging Equation A3 into Equation A2 we get,\na 1 = t1\nor\n\nhDHihDH \u2032 i\nhDH \u2032 ihDH \u2032 i\nhHH \u2032 i\n\u2212\nt\n+\na\n,\n1\n1\nhH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nhDH \u2032 ihDH \u2032 i\nhHH \u2032 i hDHihDH \u2032 i\na1 1 \u2212\n= t1\n.\n\u2212\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\nhH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\n\n(A4)\n\n(A5)\n\nEquation A5 shows two things. First, a1 does not depend on either a2 or t2 , implying that the spectrum of H\u03b1\ncorrelated emission does not depend on either the spectrum or the inferred spectrum of dust correlated emission. But,\nthere is an overall multiplicative normalization, that depends on cross correlations of H, H \u2032 , and D. Note that as\nH \u2192 H \u2032 , a1 \u2192 t1 . Equation A5 is the general case; but now suppose we assume a specific form for H \u2032 , namely we\nmix in a bit of the dust map so that H \u2032 = H + \u01ebD. This can originate from imperfect dust correction of the H\u03b1 map\nor scattering of H\u03b1 photons off of dust for example. Then the right hand side of Equation A5 reads,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh(H \u2032 \u2212 \u01ebD)H \u2032 i hD(H \u2032 \u2212 \u01ebD)ihDH \u2032 i\nhHH \u2032 i hDHihDH \u2032 i\n= t1\n\u2212\n\u2212\nt1\nhH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\nhH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhDH i hDH ihDH \u2032 i\nhD2 ihDH \u2032 i\n= t1 1 \u2212 \u01eb\n\u2212\n+\u01eb\nhH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhDH ihDH i\n.\n(A6)\n= t1 1 \u2212\nhD2 ihH \u20322 i\n\nComparing the term in parentheses with the left hand side of Equation A5 shows, that, in the case where H \u2032 is a\nlinear superposition of H and D, a1 = t1 . That is, we recover the true spectrum. The bottom line is that, if the H\u03b1\nmap does not exactly trace the free-free morphology, the spectrum will be affected, but only at most by a constant\nmultiplicative factor (i.e., it will not produce a bump in the spectrum).\nA.2. FDS99 as a tracer of both WIM and CNM spinning dust\nSo far we have assumed that FDS99 is a tracer of exclusively the CNM dust, as if WIM dust only appeared as\nH\u03b1-correlated emission. While the WIM dust indeed has a hotter color temperature (e.g. in the 60/100 micron ratio)\nthan CNM dust, it certainly also appears in the FDS99 map. Therefore, in our regression analysis, fitting the CNM\ncomponent with the FDS99 template will inadvertently absorb some of the WIM emission and affect the inferred\nspectrum of the WIM. The sense of the effect is to bias the H\u03b1-correlated WIM emission with some amount of the\nCNM spectrum, pushing the WIM spectrum to higher peak frequency and lower amplitude. In this section we estimate\nthe extent of this bias.\nIn order to calculate an estimate of the contamination of FDS99 by H\u03b1 morphology, we model the FDS99 map as a\nlinear combination of maps of H I emission and H\u03b1 emission,\n\nD = \u01eb0 L + \u03b40 H,\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere again, H is the H\u03b1 map, and L is the Kalberla et al. (2005) H I map. With this notation, \u03b40 has the units of\nmK/R. We solve the above equation over unmasked pixels (where the mask consists of the point source mask described\nin \u00a72.1 plus a masking of all pixels for which the dust extinction at H\u03b1 is 2.65E(B \u2212 V ) > 0.5 mag) and find that\n\u03b40 \u223c 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R. Although this value varies slightly from region to region (Heiles et al. 1999), the contamination\nis very small and extremely subtle (see Figure 12). Nevertheless, based on our value of \u03b40 , H\u03b1 morphology does indeed\n\"contaminate\" the FDS99 map since the large grains in the WIM emit thermal radiation at 94 GHz as well.\nTo calculate the affect on the inferred spectrum, we can use the same procedure as \u00a7A.1 but now taking D\u2032 \u2192 D+\u03b40 H.\nIt is straightforward to show that the recovered H\u03b1-correlated spectrum becomes,\na 1 = t1 \u2212 \u03b4 0 t2 .\n\n(A8)\n\nThat is, the inferred H\u03b1-correlated spectrum is contaminated by the FDS99-correlated spectrum at a level that is\ngiven by \u03b40 . Assuming that H exactly traces both the free-free emission and the WIM spinning dust emission and\nthat D exactly traces CNM emission (thermal and spinning dust), the implication is that the bump in the inferred\nspectrum of the H\u03b1-correlated emission represents the WIM spinning dust spectrum minus some amount of the CNM\nspinning dust spectrum, determined by how much the H\u03b1 morphology has leaked into the FDS99 map via large grain\nthermal emission in the WIM.\nThe left panel of Figure 13 shows the level of contamination of the H\u03b1-correlated spectra by taking D\u2032 = FDS99\u2212\u03b4 \u00d7\nH\u03b1 as a tracer of CNM dust. As expected from Equation A8, for large values of \u03b4, the H\u03b1 map is being over-subtracted\nfrom FDS99 and the resultant spectrum is highly contaminated by a CNM thermal plus spinning dust spectrum (cf.,\n\n\f17\nFigures 5 and 9). For \u03b4 = 0 mK/R on the other hand, some of the WIM spinning dust bump is being absorbed in the\nD\u2032 -correlated spectrum and so the bump in the H\u03b1-correlated spectrum represents a WIM spinning dust minus some\nCNM spinning dust spectrum. Based on the fit in Equation A7, the \u03b4 = \u03b40 \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R case is a nearly pure\nmixture of free-free plus CMB plus WIM spinning dust spectrum.\nHowever, since the WIM does also emit thermal dust radiation, if we assume that FDS99 is a perfect representation\nof the thermal emission at 94 GHz, then removing the WIM (H\u03b1) morphology from FDS99 implies that the H\u03b1correlated spectrum also contains that thermal emission. We can estimate the amplitude of this effect by assuming\nthat the WIM thermal emission has a \u03bd \u03b2 dependence on frequency with \u03b2 = 3.7 (in intensity units, \u03b2 = 1.7 in antenna\ntemperature) and adding \u03b4 \u00d7 H \u00d7 (\u03bd/94 GHz)3.7 back into the H\u03b1-correlated spectrum. This is equivalent to setting,\n\u0014\n\u00111.7 \u0015\n\u0010 \u03bd\n\u2032\n\u00d7 \u03b4 \u00d7 H\u03b1.\n(A9)\nD = FDS99 \u2212 1 \u2212\n94 GHz\nThe resultant spectra are shown in the middle panel of Figure 13. In this case, the bump is ideally due to only spinning\ndust emission from the WIM for \u03b4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R. For larger values of \u03b4 the CNM spinning dust spectrum begins\nto leak into the fit so that by \u03b4 = 10 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R, the spinning dust bump has moved towards the lower CNM value,\nand the amplitude has increased since the WIM and CNM spectra are now both present in the data.\nLastly, the right panel of Figure 13 shows \u03c72 and D0 contours in the (nH , \u03bc0 ) plane for a free-free plus CMB plus\nWIM spinning dust fit to the \u03b4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R spectra in the middle panel of Figure 13. These contours indicate\nthat the best fit values of nH and \u03bc0 are not significantly affected by the presence of WIM morphology in the FDS99\nmap for our estimate of \u03b4 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 mK/R. Nevertheless, the exact level of PAH depletion measured by our technique\n(D0 ) will depend on precisely how one estimates the WIM leakage in FDS99. We defer a detailed analysis of this to\nfuture work.\n\n\f"}
