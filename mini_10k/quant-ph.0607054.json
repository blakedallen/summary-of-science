Introduction\nAs quantum information becomes closer to applications, the need for quantum memories\nbecomes stronger [1, 2, 3]. Quantum memories are systems which store in so-called\n\"static qubits\" the quantum information usually carried by \"flying qubits\", namely\nphotons. A single ion or a pair of ions forms a prototype of such a quantum memory\n[4, 5, 6]. It has also been shown that an ensemble of atoms can successfully store\nthe quantum information carried by a single photon [2, 7, 8]. However, quantum\ninformation processing is not limited to discrete variables: continuous variable systems\nalso form an attractive tool for such a purpose [9, 10, 11]. In this context, the use of an\nensemble of atoms as a quantum memory has been proposed [12, 13] and experimentally\ndemonstrated [14]. In this realization, both the storage medium and the light beam are\ndescribed by continuous variables.\nThe goal of this paper is to study the feasibility of a quantum memory relying\non a large cloud of cold trapped ions. As we will show, such a system has several\nadvantages with respect to the neutral atom clouds. Among those, one can mention\nthe strong confinement of the ions that opens the way to an efficient interaction with\nlight while keeping the sample immobile in the interaction region for a virtually infinite\ntime. The paper is organized as follows: we will start by describing the basic requisites\nfor a quantum memory and by briefly recalling the principles which govern a lightmatter interface suitable for such a purpose. Then, we will propose an experimental\nimplementation based on a cloud of cold trapped ions. We will finally present the\nexpected properties with respect to decoherence and memory lifetime of such a system.\n2. Continuous Variable and Quantum Memory Principles\nIn the case considered here of a quantum memory for continuous variables, quantum\ninformation is carried by the quadrature components of a pulse of light such as in\n[14, 13, 15]. We will quickly recall the continuous variable formalism in subsection 2.1,\nand then introduce the criteria that define the boundaries between the classical and\nquantum regimes for a quantum memory in subsection 2.2.\n2.1. Continuous Variables\n2.1.1. Continuous Observables The observables studied in Continuous Variable\nquantum systems [16, 17, 18] (the quadratures) are formally analogue to the position\nand momentum of a particle and hence usually noted Q\u0302 and P\u0302 . In the system described\nhere, the \"quadratures\" of the ion cloud will be the projection of the global spin of the\ncloud along some direction, while the corresponding variables of the light beam will be\ntwo Stokes operators describing its polarization [19, 20]. When suitably normalized,\nthey obey the canonical commutation relation[16, 17]\n[Q\u0302, P\u0302 ] = 2i.\n\n(1)\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n3\n\nThe above commutation relation implies the Heisenberg relation\n\u03b4Q \u03b4P \u2265 1,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4Q (resp. \u03b4P ) is the standard deviation of Q (resp. P ). The fact that the\nquadratures can take any real value also comes from this commutation relation.\n2.1.2.\nGaussian States and Channels When the characteristic functions and\nquasiprobability distributions of the system are Gaussian, it is said to be in a Gaussian\nstate. If Gaussian states are the simplest to study theoretically, they are also fortunately\nthe most common in experiments. We will therefore restrict ourselves to Gaussian states\nin this article. Since the probability distributions associated with the quadratures of\na Gaussian state are Gaussian, such a state is fully characterized by the average value\nand the covariance matrix of the continuous observables.\nA Gaussian operation -i.e. an operation which preserves the Gaussian character\nof the state- can then be described by a linear action on the quadratures, possibly\nincluding the coupling with an external mode. For example, the action of a lossy channel\nwith absorption \u03b5 on a mode (Q\u0302in , P\u0302in ) is given by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(3)\nQ\u0302out = 1 \u2212 \u03b5Q\u0302in + \u03b5Q\u0302vac\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(4)\nP\u0302out = 1 \u2212 \u03b5P\u0302in + \u03b5P\u0302vac ,\nwhere (Q\u0302vac , P\u0302vac ) is a mode in a vacuum state i.e. Q\u0302vac and P\u0302vac are uncorrelated to\nthe input mode, and have zero average value and unit variance.\n2.2. Criteria for quantum memory\n2.2.1. Generic criteria A quantum memory, by definition, stores informations about\na quantum state for a given time interval, and it should do it better than any classical\nmemory (i.e. classical-states based memory). Since an a priori known quantum state\nhas a complete classical description (its density matrix), it can be reconstructed with an\narbitrarily high fidelity by a setup only storing this description in a classical memory.\nTherefore, similarly to quantum teleportation criteria [21], a quantum memory criterion\ncan only be defined when the input is unknown, i.e. when the input state is drawn at\nrandom from a given set S of possible states.\nThe output of the quantum memory can either be a quantum state or classical\ninformation. In the following, we will consider these two situations that we name the\nIdentity Quantum Memory (IdQM) and the Delayed Measurement Quantum Memory\n(DMQM). The output of an Identity Quantum Memory should be a quantum state\nas close as possible to the input state. The input-output mapping of a perfect IdQM\nis then the identity operator, hence its name. Applications of IdQMs include storing\nintermediate states in quantum computation and the realization of collective attacks\nagainst quantum cryptography [22]. The best classical setup devoted to the task of\nan IdQM, first measures the input state, then stores the obtained information in a\nclassical memory and finally tries to reconstruct the input state from this information.\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n4\n\nThis reconstruction problem has been well studied and the best classical reconstruction\nfidelity is well known in a lot of situations [21, 23]. The usual figure of merit for such\na memory is the (average or minimal) fidelity, but any distortion measure can be used.\nAmong them, entropic quantities suit to cryptographic applications [22].\nWhile a perfect IdQM allows to construct any conceivable quantum memory, the\ncorresponding criterion, defining the worst IdQM, is not always relevant, as shown\nbelow.\nAnother quantum memory application commonly discussed in the literature is\nrelated to the delayed measurement problem [24]. A delayed measurement quantum\nmemory (DMQM) receives a quantum state to be stored, and only later learns the\nmeasurement to be performed on that state. The output of the DMQM is the classical\nresult of this target-measurement. A commonly discussed application of a DMQM is\nthe realization of individual attacks against quantum cryptographic schemes. As above,\nthe suitable figure of merit changes with the memory application, but, in any case, the\nfidelity is not the relevant figure of merit, since the output of this quantum memory\nis classical. The optimal classical strategy to perform a classical measurement is to\nimmediately measure the quantum state and store the result in a classical memory.\nWhen the target-measurement is drawn from a set of incompatible measurements, the\nbest classical measurement will be approximative, since it has to guess the result of all\nincompatible target-measurement. However, this optimal classical strategy doesn't need\nto reconstruct the input state, which usually renders the criterion for DMQM stricter\nthan the IdQM one. In other words, if an IdQM followed by the relevant measurement\nis a possible way to build a DMQM, the resulting DMQM is not guaranteed to be better\nthan its optimal classical counterpart, even if the IdQM is above the quantum threshold.\nThe two definition above can be formalized in a more general framework, described\nbelow. A quantum memory is a channel taking two inputs, one of which is a quantum\nstate drawn from a known set S = {\u03c1i }i with probability pi , and the other is an\n(optional) delayed information \u03c4 . The action of the memory on \u03c1 can be described\nby the completely positive map \u03c6\u03c4 , which should be as close as possible to a target\n. The target map corresponding to the IdQM described above is the identity\nmap \u03c6target\n\u03c4\ntarget\n\u03c6\u03c4\n= I and doesn't depend on \u03c4 . For the DMQM, the \u03c6target\ncorrespond to the\n\u03c4\nvarious measurements, each \u03c4 identifying a particular measurement.\nThe optimal classical strategy trying to simulate \u03c6target\ndefines the criterion for a\n\u03c4\nquantum memory. This strategy should be based on measurements, classical memory\nand state reconstruction. Furthermore, the measurements must not depend on \u03c4 .\nOne can see from the above examples and definitions that there are as many criteria\nfor quantum memories as there are applications, the criteria depending on the input state\nset S, the target map \u03c6\u03c4 , and the chosen figure of merit.\n2.2.2. Continuous Variable quantum memories As mentioned before, we will restrict\nourselves to continuous variables-quantum memories (IdQM and DMQM). Furthermore,\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n5\n\nwe will restrict ourself to gaussian quantum memories\u2021. Therefore S is a covariant set\nof gaussian states with uniform distribution in phase-space.\nSince the quantum memory is gaussian, it can be described like a Gaussian Channel,\nwith the following input-output relation :\np\np\n(5)\nQ\u0302out = GQ Q\u0302in + NQ Q\u0302vac\np\np\nP\u0302out = GP P\u0302in \u00b1 NP P\u0302vac ,\n(6)\np\np\nwith N \u2265 |G \u2212 1|, where the noise N = NQ NP and the gain G = GQ GP .\nIn the following, we will describe the criteria for IdQM and DMQM, illustrating\nthem via the example of an optical fiber loop.\nThe best classical IdQM approximation is well studied since the early days of\ncontinuous variable teleportation [21], and has a unity gain and a noise equivalent to\ntwice the shot noise on both quadratures. An IdQM should therefore verify\nGQ = GP = 1\n\nN < 2.\n\n(7)\n\nNote that if GQ 6= GP but G = 1, the memory squeezes the input. Since the squeezing\nis a reversible operation, such a memory can be considered as a generalized IdQM.\nAs easily seen from eq. 4,the noise added by an optical fiber of transmission\nT = 1 \u2212 \u03b5 has a variance equal to \u03b5 = 1 \u2212 T . If one wants to use this fiber as an\nIdQM, one needs to correct for the transmission gain T by preamplifying the input with\na gain 1/T , adding a noise of at least 1/T \u2212 1. The resulting channel has then the\nwanted unit gain, and a noise N = 2(1 \u2212 T ), always smaller than the classical limit of\n2. However, T decreases exponentially, at a rate of 0.04 dB/\u03bcs in a fiber of refracting\nindex n = 1.5 and attenuation 0.2 dB/km. The transmission T being divided by 100\nevery 500 \u03bcs, this memory quickly becomes indistinguishable from a classical memory,\neven in the absence of technical noise.\nThe canonical continuous variable DMQM allows to measure either Q or P . The\ncorresponding optimal classical measurement has been studied since Heisenberg, and\nthe noise added by this measurement obeys the uncertainty relationship \u03b4Q * \u03b4P \u2265 1.\nThe violation of this relationship, written\nN\n<1\n(8)\nG\nis therefore a criterion for continuous variable DMQM.\nIf one implements a DMQM with a fiber loop followed by a (perfect) homodyne\nmeasurement, the relevant figure of merit is the equivalent input noise N/G [16] of the\nfiber, and the criterion can be written\n1\n1\n\u22121 <1 \u21d4T > ,\nT\n2\nwhich corresponds to a maximal storage time of 75 \u03bcs in an optical fiber loop.\n\u2021 even if they are not always optimal for commonly used figures of merit [23]\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n6\n\n2.3. Quantum memory with an X-type level scheme\n2.3.1. Light-matter interaction The unique experimental realization of a continuous\nvariable quantum memory to date is based on a three step process [14]: first, the light\npulse carrying the quantum information is sent through the sample; the output beam is\nthen measured; and finally a feed-back is performed on the sample conditioned on this\nmeasurement. In this realization, the levels involved are considered as an X-type system,\nwith two levels in the ground state and two in the excited state coupled by two lasers\n(Fig. 1). Other level schemes have also been proposed. For instance, when a \u039b-type\nlevel scheme is used (with only one excited state and two lasers), a single interaction\nis sufficient [13, 15]. Other proposed schemes, involve multiple passages through the\natomic medium [25] and no back-action via a magnetic field pulse. In this paper, we\nwill focus on the first scheme.\nWe will follow here the formalism introduced in [19]. Let us begin by recalling\nits main properties.

A second operation is now necessary to map the\nother quadrature of light (Qp ) onto the other quadrature of the collective spin (Pa ). As\nstated previously, this is done using a measurement of the output light beam and a feed\nback onto the memory.\n\u03b5a = Np |g|2\n\n2.3.2. Measurement and feed-back Using standard quantum optics techniques, one can\neasily measure the Q\u0302p quadrature of the light beam emerging from the cloud. This\ninformation can then be mapped onto the atomic operator P\u0302a using for example a\n\u221a\nradio-frequency magnetic field pulse [14]. This can be done using a gain G which can\nbe fixed arbitrarily.

We have thus\nrealized a quantum memory for light.\n2.3.3. Quantum memory criteria The criteria for an IdQM (Eq.7) and for a DMQM\n(Eq.8) are expressed as a function of the gains GQ,P and added noises NQ,P .

We now turn our attention to the experimental implementation that we\npropose, based on a large ensemble of cold ions with a 1/2 \u2192 1/2 transition efficiently\ncoupled to light.\n3. Experimental implementation\n3.1. Linear Paul trap\nTrapping particles with external fields allows to produce well controlled quantum\nsystems isolated from the environment. Furthermore, laser cooling techniques have\nbrought the possibility of creating dilute gases with extremely narrow velocity\ndistributions, thus optimizing the interaction with optical fields and the control of\nthe system by these fields. A standard tool to trap and manipulate neutral atoms\nis the Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT)[36]. In such traps, the atomic sample has to be\nin permanent interaction with near-resonance lasers in order to remain trapped. This\ninteraction induces a high rate of spontaneous emission, leading to a rapid decoherence\nof both external and internal degrees of freedom. Cold atoms based quantum-optics\nexperiments are thus usually carried out in the absence of the cooling and trapping\nlasers on a free sample, leading to relatively short interaction times (ms) and evolving\nconditions (velocity, density...) [37]. The ion trapping techniques take advantage of the\nstrong electrostatic force which allows one to tailor very deep (eV) confining potentials\nthat are independent of cooling lasers. The laser cooling techniques can be applied very\nefficiently to the trapped sample, with a very simple 1D beam geometry that performs\n3D cooling due to the strong coupling of the motional degrees of freedom induced by\nthe electrostatic forces between ions. Once cooled, the ions may remain trapped and\ncool in the absence of cooling lasers for long period of time (s) compared to atom\ntraps. A standard tool for trapping ions in quantum optics and quantum information\nexperiments is the Paul trap that is based on time-varying electric potential applied to\na set of electrodes. The standard Paul trap [38] has a quasi-spherical geometry with\nfew optical access. A common variant is the linear-Paul trap [39] , based on the same\nprinciples but offering more versatility in the geometry design. In order to carry-out\nquantum memory experiments involving the macroscopic spin of an ion sample, it is\nimportant to optimise the interaction of a laser beam with the sample. Thus, we have\nchosen a very anisotropic geometry, leading to quasi-1D sample, very elongated along\nthe propagation direction of the laser (z). The linear-Paul trap (Figure 2) is made of\nfour rods as main trapping electrodes, two of them being brought to a high-frequency\nhigh-voltage potential. These electrodes are responsible for a 2D confinement in the\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n10\n\n21\u20442\nDec\nFigure 2. Principle of a linear Paul trap. Two transverse trapping electrodes are\nbrought to a high-frequency high-voltage potential (in red), two are at ground voltage\n(green). The longitudinal trapping electrodes are brought to a static positive voltage\n(blue). The ions are trapped as an ellipso\u0131\u0308dal cloud at the center of the trap (orange).\n\nplane (xOy) perpendicular to the electrodes axis. Two ring electrodes brought to a\nstatic positive voltage trap the ions along the axial direction (Oz).\nThis geometry offers a wide variety of optical accesses, in transverse direction for\nlaser cooling and along the axis for optimal interaction with a focused laser beam\ncarrying the quantum information. This set-up is currently being developed in our\ngroup. The dimension we have chosen (\u03c1 = 2.6 mm, Dec = 20 mm, see Fig. 2) allows\nthe formation of a sample of 5 mm long, 200 \u03bcm large, containing a few 105 ions [28].\nUsing a tighter confinement, i.e. more closely spaced electrodes, one can expect to\ntrap approximately 2.2 106 ions using realistic values for the RF voltage (800 V) with a\nsection of 60 \u03bcm and a length of 2 cm for the ions cloud.\n3.2. Choice of the ion\nWe restrict ourselves to the second column of the periodic table (alkaline earth elements)\n: these elements, when deprived of an electron, have an electronic structure consisting of\na shell with a single orbiting electron. This structure, identical to the alkaline elements,\nreadily provides transitions necessary for an easy manipulation with light fields. The\navailable non radioactive elements are beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and\nbaryum. All these ions have identical electronic structures namely 2S1/2\u21922P1/2\ntransitions. These transitions are located from the mid (Be+ ) to the near UV (Ba+ ).\nChoosing the last two elements allows one to use solid-state laser technologies, such as\nTi:Sa lasers. It is interesting to choose two neighboring species (like Sr+ and Ba+ ) which\ncan be easily manipulated with light fields: having two species at hand allows one to\nperform sympathetic cooling [29]. In a sympathetic cooling scheme, the heavier element\n(Ba+ ) will be located at the perimeter of the trap and the lighter element (Sr+ ) at the\ncenter. This last element will thus be confined in an elliptic-shaped region, well adapted\nto the interaction with a focused laser beam. In the following, we will thus consider a\ncloud of cold Sr+ ions as active medium.\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n11\n\n4. Trapped ions for a quantum memory\n4.1. Relevant parameters for the X-type level scheme\nAs mentioned in section 2.3, the relevant parameters are \u03ba and \u03b5a,p . We first compare\non Tab.1, the values of the experimental parameters for the proposed experiment and\nthat used in [14].\nNp\n\n\u03bb\n(nm)\n852\n422\n\nNa\n\nRef.

Experimental parameters\n\nFrom these values, one can calculate the parameters relevant for Eqs. (14-17): the\ncorresponding values of g, \u03ba and \u03b5a,p are shown in Tab. 2. The calculation of these\nparameters for experiment [14] is more involved since the transition which is used is\nF = 4, mF = \u00b14 \u2192 F \u2032 = 5. Thus we will use the value for \u03ba given in Ref.[14]. In this\nexperiment, the number of photons and atoms involved being large, the noises induced\nby \u03b5a,p are small (the value given by our model are indicated in Tab. 2 as a reference).\nThe exact values of \u03b5p is not relevant since the optical losses due to the cell windows\nare predominant.\ng2\nRef.

For the ion experiment, we\nhave taken Np = 2.1 1012 (corresponding to the same power as Ref.[14]), Na = 1.5 106 ,\n\u2206 = 8 103 \u03b3, A = 1.1 10\u22128 m2 (corresponding to a beam waist of 60 \u03bcm, adjusted to\nthe maximal cloud section).\n\nOne remarks that, even though the values of \u03ba are comparable, the photonic noise\nterm, due to \u03b5p , is much larger in the ion experiment. This is due to the fact that\nthe number of interacting atoms, Na , is much smaller in this experiment. The use of\nan immobile ensemble of ions allows one to choose a much tighter focusing, increasing\nthe atom-photon coupling constant, g and keeping the value of \u03ba large. Furthermore,\nlet us note that the value of \u03b5a remains very small, on the order of a few percent,\nwhich is comparable to the other losses which will appear in a typical quantum optics\nexperiments (detection losses in particular). One also remarks that \u03b5a and \u03ba both\ndepend on the ratio Np /\u22062 . When this quantity is kept constant, \u03b5a and \u03ba will both\nremain constant (provided the other parameters do not change). One can thus use a\nmuch smaller number of photons, for instance using shorter pulses (\u03bcs), together with\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n12\n\na smaller detuning. This approach remains valid as long as Np remains larger than Na :\nwhen Na \u226b Np , the dominant noise is the photonic noise corresponding to \u03b5p .\n4.2. Performances of the memory, decoherence\nLet us now discuss the behavior of the proposed ion memory with respect to the\ndecoherence and other phenomena that may affect its performances. We can distinguish\nthree different phases in which a real memory may not follow an ideal behavior: the\nwriting phase, the storage phase and the readout phase. We discussed in section 2.2.2\nthe effect of the losses \u03b5 associated to the writing and (eventually) to the readout phases.\nIn particular, in the case of a DMQM the condition \u03b5 < 1/2 must be fulfilled, where\nwe consider \u03b5 as the cumulative losses. Concerning the volatility of the memory, the\ndecoherence of the collective spin state is the main limitation to long storage times.\nSuch a decoherence can be described in terms of an additional loss \u03b5sto that takes into\naccount the spins flips or atomic losses that may occur in the cloud. In the neutralatom based memory [14] the storage time is limited by three major phenomena: the\nspin-flips that can occur during atomic collisions, the finite time spent by an atom in\nthe laser beam, and the dephasing induced by magnetic field inhomogeneities. The\nfirst two phenomena are expected to give a negligible contribution in the case of cold\ntrapped ions. Indeed, due to the electrostatic repulsion, the ions can not collide to give\na spin-flip (core collisions): in a raw evaluation the spin-spin and spin-orbit interaction\nat the characteristic distance of \u223c 1\u03bcm can only affect the energy levels with a shift\nof the order of 100 Hz [30]. Furthermore, the ion cloud being trapped by electrostatic\nfields that confine strongly the ion cloud and which are not switched-off during the\nexperiment, no ion will move out of the laser beam during the whole interaction time.\nThe main effect of magnetic field inhomogeneities is to induce a spread in the\nprecession frequencies around the external magnetic field that imposes the quantification\naxis. Such an effect would seem to affect an ion cloud in the same way it affects a neutral\natomic cloud. However, in an ion Coulomb crystal the position of every ion is fixed in\nspace. In this situation, when the readout time for the information stored in the quantum\nmemory is a known parameter, it is possible to wash-out the effect of inhomogeneities\nwith a spin-echo experiment. Moreover, let us remark that the space region in which\nthe inhomogeneities have to be controlled is smaller in the case of trapped ions: it is\ntherefore easier to use passive or active compensation coils to reduce the stray fields\ndown to some tenths of nT [31].\nLet us now discuss the other phenomena that could deteriorate the performances\nof a quantum memory in the case of trapped ion clouds. Large ion Coulomb crystal\ncan be obtained with characteristic temperatures in the range of 20\u2013100 mK [32, 33].\nContrary to the case of ions near the trap axis, the ions in the external part of the crystal\nare subject to a non-vanishing RF field that induces a micro-motion. In a laser-cooled\nsub-Kelvin crystal, such a micro-motion, that mainly affects the radial motion of the\nion, is not the main source of heating [33] and its effect is mainly limited to a Doppler\n\n\fFeasibility of a quantum memory for continuous variables based on trapped ions\n\n13\n\nShift of the optical transition (that is important only during the writing and reading\nphases). This residual motion is well described by a thermal motion with a maximum\ntemperature in the 100 mK range, that gives us for Sr+ a rms Doppler shift of \u223c 10 MHz,\nmuch smaller than the detuning \u2206 and smaller than the natural line-width \u03b3. Let us\nremark again that the situation of a large ion cloud described by a collective continuous\nquantum variable is very different with respect to the case of discrete motional quantum\nstates that are very sensitive to any residual micro-motion. Other contributions to the\ndecoherence could originate from the DC Stark shift induced by trapping electric fields\nand from the quadrupolar shift due to electric-field gradients. The first contribution\nshould vanish at the potential minima that correspond to equilibrium position in an ion\ncrystal, but the ions are subject to thermal motion and explore regions with nonzero\nfields and gradients. Such a problem has been carefully analyzed in the case of single\nions trapped in the center of a small trap for metrology purposes [34, 35]. In this case\nthe main contribution to the shift of energy levels is the quadrupolar coupling that, for\nwell compensated traps can be as low as a fraction of Hz. Even in a larger trap, we\nstill expect a negligible contribution to decoherence from these phenomena. Finally,\nanother candidate that could affect the storage time of an ion-based memory is the\npresence of collisions with the neutral background gas in the vacuum chamber. This\nphenomenon is the most important heating source in large cold Coulomb crystals [33]:\nthe trapped ions that collide with a neutral particle are not ejected from the trap but\ntheir kinetic energy increases such that they escape from their initial site. Such kind of\ncollisions could naturally induce a spin-flip and their rate should be minimized in order\nto achieve long storage times. The expected rates in ion Coulomb crystals in a vacuum\nof \u2243 10\u221210 mbar are of the order of \u03c41 = 0.03 collisions per ion per second [29]. Such a\nrate will induce an exponential time-dependent loss term \u03b5sto (t) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u22122t/\u03c4 ).\n4.3. Quantum memory criteria\nAs shown previously, the quality of the quantum memory can not be evaluated\nindependently of its purpose. It is thus necessary to calculate the parameters G =\np\np\nGQ GP and N = NQ NP . These parameters can be calculated taking into account\nadditional optical losses before and after the interaction as well as the decay induced by\nthe main cause of decoherence, i.e. collisions with neutral particles as mentioned above.\nTaking \u2206 = 3 104 \u03b3 and no losses, one gets N = 0.08 and G = 1 without losses.\nIf one takes into account the losses, G is now 0.96 and N is 1.6. The criteria for a\ngeneralized IdQM (G = 1, N < 2) is thus fulfilled for N but not for G except in the\nabsence of losses. This system is thus not suitable for such an application.\nHowever, it forms a very efficient DMQM, as we will show. We calculate now the\nvalues of G and N in different cases (Tab. 3).\nThis table shows N/G is small in both cases. We remark that the value expected\nfor the ion cloud is smaller with respect to the value obtained for Ref.[14].

Using a typical value T = 0.1 for the coupling mirror\ntransmission, one obtains for our parameters C \u2248 55 which is similar to the value\ntypically obtained with cold neutral atoms in a magneto-optical trap.\nOur analysis demonstrate that, independently of the chosen interaction scheme, a\nquantum memory based on a cold ion cloud is feasible. Moreover, this approach leaves\nopen for the experimentalist the possibility to explore a wide region in the parameter\nspace, still obtaining a functional memory.\nC=\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper we presented the theoretical and practical issues related to the realization of\na quantum memory that stores quantum information carried by continuous variables in\nthe collective spin observables of a large cloud of trapped and cooled ions. In particular\nwe discussed the different criteria that quantum memories may have to fulfill and we\npresented the physical basis of quantum recording, based on previous theoretical analysis\n[19]. By comparing the relevant physical parameters that can be obtained using a large\nion crystal to that of the unique experimental example of an atomic quantum memory\n[14], we demonstrated that the use of laser cooled ions (e.g. 88 Sr+ ions) is, under several\naspects, an ideal case.
