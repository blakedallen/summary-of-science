Understanding the\nevolved mechanisms and the associated non-linear dynamics that allow the neurons to function in \u2013 and even\nexploit \u2013 a noisy environment is an essential step towards gaining insight into the information transmission\nand communication networks in the brain. Such studies also have important implications beyond the domain\nof biophysics and neuroscience. Noise provides a critical\nbarrier for the development of sensitive electronic and\nmechanical devices, particularly at the nanoscale [2, 3].\nIncreasingly, researchers are focusing on exploring innovative, non-traditional device design and control strategies that exploit the ambient noise [4\u201311]. In this regard,\nthere are clear advantages to understanding how nature\nhas managed to harness noise in a setting whose primary\n(apparent) function is to manage information.\nIt is generally accepted that neurons communicate\nwith each other using sharp electric pulses referred to\nas action potentials or spikes. Each neuron is connected\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\ncsobie@uvic.ca\nbabul@uvic.ca\nrdesousa@uvic.ca\n\nto several other neurons, and will only generate a spike\noutput when the integrated input from other neurons\nexceeds a certain threshold [12\u201314]. A startling discovery that (under certain circumstances) neurons can spike\nmore regularly when stimulated by noise [15\u201317] led to\nassertions that noise is inherent to neuron function. Several subsequent experimental and theoretical studies were\naimed at elucidating the functionality of neural noise [18\u2013\n23]. In the first instance, noise \u2013 as expected \u2013 introduces\na variability in the interspike intervals and degrades the\ninformation capacity of the spike trains, with low contrast signals being most affected [22]. At the same time,\nthese studies also found that stochastic resonance provides a mechanism for neurons to take advantage of their\nown noise. In stochastic resonance, the addition of an\nappropriate amount of noise in a non-linear system can\ninduce regularity by sensitizing subthreshold excitations,\nthus providing the extra energy for them to reach threshold [15, 16, 19] and enabling their detection. Additionally, Brunel et al. [24] and Svirskis [25] have shown that\na model neuron, when subjected to low frequency noise,\nis able to respond faster to a sudden excitation than in\nthe absence of noise. For an animal living in a natural environment, the ability to react quickly to sudden threats\ncan mean the difference between life and death.\nAll of the studies to date that have considered the impact of low frequency noise on neurons tend to model\nnoise characterized by a single Lorentzian power spec-\n\n\f2\ntrum. Natural noise, however, has an ubiquitous 1/f\nfrequency dependence [3, 26\u201330]. From current carrying\nelectronic devices and geophysical time series to biological systems, the 1/f power spectrum is everywhere. In\nbiological settings, human hearing and speech [27], the\nresponse of biological photoreceptors to large intensity\nvariation of visual image streams in nature [28], the stride\nintervals time series of normal human gait [29], intrinsic\nnoise in neuronal membranes due to stochastic opening\nand closing of the various ion channels [30], etc. all exhibit 1/f behavior. Guerra et al. [7] demonstrated how\nstochastic resonance induced by 1/f noise can increase\nthe sensitivity of nanomechanical resonators, allowing for\nthe possibility of fashioning them into noisy but robust\nnanoscale computation devices. Neither the response nor\nthe details of the underlying non-equilibrium behavior\nthat makes neurons robust to natural (1/f ) noise is well\nunderstood.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive study of how\nneuron dynamics is affected by an arbitrary noise spectral density, and which sectors of the spectra are responsible for the beneficial functions that noise can provide.\nSpecifically, we explore whether neuron response under\n1/f noise is significantly different from the one found in\nthe presence of a simple Lorentzian spectra.\nThe relevance of low frequency noise, implied by a 1/f\nspectrum, to spike dynamics at the single neuron level\nis especially evident, as we shall argue, in the direct experimental measurements of the spike count Fano factor\nby Teich et al.[31, 32] (Fano factor is the ratio between\nthe variance and the mean spike number during a given\nobservation time). These authors demonstrated that the\nFano factor of single neurons in the visual systems of\ncats and insects increases monotonically as a function of\ntime. This is in dramatic contrast to the simple Poisson\nmodel (white noise), which leads to Fano factor equal to\none at all times. The monotonic rise is also incompatible with models based on Lorentzian noise because the\nresulting Fano factor saturates at times longer than the\ninverse Lorentzian half width [21, 33]. We show that the\ncharacteristic non-ergodicity of 1/f noise explains why\nthe Fano factor never saturates in single neuron experiments. Moreover, the rate at which the Fano factor grows\nas a function of time is different for 1/f and Lorentzian.\nIn addition, we consider the effect of 1/f noise on the\nreaction time of a neuron in response to a sudden stimulus. We demonstrate that 1/f noise is nearly optimal\nfor speeding up neuron response. We provide an explanation for this effect that sheds light on the mechanism\nof neuron adaptation to their noisy environment.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II describes\nour model for the neuron: the leaky integrate and fire\n(LIF) model of the neuron, and explains how we introduce 1/f noise and other spectral densities in this model.\nSection III describes an analytical theory and a set of numerical simulations of the neuron Fano factor as a function of time and compares our result to experiment [31].\nParticularly notable is our general expression Eq. (13) re-\n\nlating the Fano factor to an integral over low frequency\nnoise weighted by an appropriate filter function. Section IV addresses the question of how noise can provide\na mechanism for neurons to respond faster to a sudden\nstimulus. Section V provides our concluding remarks.\nII.\n\nTHE LIF MODEL\n\nFrom a biophysical perspective, the classical HodgkinHuxley model [13] and its contemporary variants represent the most realistic mathematical description of electrical response of a single neuron. Due to their intrinsic\ncomplexity, however, such models render the theoretical and computational analysis of neuronal and neural\nnetwork dynamics exceedingly difficult. For this reason,\nmost studies to date tend to reference the simpler spiking neuron models, of which the leaky integrate and fire\n(LIF) model [12, 14] that we adopt is one. The LIF model\nrepresents each neuron by an electrical circuit; when\nappropriate circuit parameters and features are chosen,\nthe LIF model can reproduce quite similar dynamics to\nthe one described by the more complex Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel [1].\nThe LIF model consists of a capacitor C in parallel\nwith a resistor R; an injected continuous current I(t)\nmodels the spike input from a large number of neighboring neurons. The neuron (or capacitor) voltage V (t) is\ngiven by the circuit equation,\nC\n\ndV (t) V (t)\n+\n= I(t).\ndt\nR\n\n(1)\n\nA spike is generated whenever the voltage across the capacitor reaches a certain threshold Vth ; after the spike\nis emitted, the neuron is reset to a zero voltage state.\nNote how the threshold rule for spike generation introduces non-linearity in the LIF model: Consider two input currents I1 (t) and I2 (t); a neuron subject to input\n[I1 (t) + I2 (t)] will generally reach threshold faster than\na neuron that is subject to either I1 (t) or I2 (t) only.\nHence, the sum of outputs obtained from I1 (t) and I2 (t)\napplied separately is different from the output obtained\nfrom [I1 (t) + I2 (t)]. Also, the resistance R plays an important role in the model: it allows charge to leak out,\nthus negating inputs received in the distant past. Neurons have the property that inputs long past have less\neffect than recent inputs; a sufficient amount of input\nmust happen sufficiently rapidly for the neuron to fire.\nThe version of the LIF model that we are using has\nan additional feature that makes it more realistic: The\nintroduction of a refractory time period \u03c4r , which models\nthe physical reset time for a neuron after emitting a spike.\nThis prevents the neuron from receiving input for a time\n\u03c4r after spiking. Our choice for these circuit parameters\nare given in Table I.\nThe presence of a leak and a refractory period makes\nthe LIF neuron extremely hard to treat analytically [33].\nAs a result, many theoretical studies have focused on the\n\n\f3\nR = \u221e and \u03c4r = 0 limit, the so called perfect (non-leaky)\nintegrate and fire model [21, 34]. This latter model is\nmuch easier to analyze but as we will demonstrate, the\nreduced complexity also leads to significantly different\ndynamics.\nA.\n\nIntroducing noise in the LIF model\n\nWe considered the LIF model subject to a noisy input\ncurrent of the form\nI(t) = \u03b8 (I0 + I1 \u03b7(t)) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I0 is a (constant) bias current, I1 is the noise amplitude, and \u03b8(x) is the Heaviside step function: \u03b8(x) = 1\nfor x \u2265 0 and \u03b8(x) = 0 for x < 0; this ensures the current\ninput represents the sum of spikes from a large number\nof connected neurons. The time series \u03b7(t) is a Gaussian\nstochastic process, with variance equal to one and power\nspectra given by\nZ \u221e\n1\ndt ei2\u03c0f t h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(0)i,\n(3)\nS\u0303(f ) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nwith the brackets h ... i denoting ensemble averages\nover a large number of time series \u03b7(t). Appendix A describes the method used to generate individual time series\nfor any given noise spectral density S\u0303(f ). We considered\na number of different noise densities, including the family\nof power law spectral densities\nS\u0303\u03b1 (f ) = A\u03b1\n\n1\n,\nf\u03b1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is an exponent (\u03b1 = 1 corresponds to 1/f noise).\nThe normalization constant RA\u03b1 is set by the condition for\nthe variance to be one, 2\u03c0 df S\u0303(f ) = h\u03b7 2 i = 1 [In the\ncase of \u03b1 = 1 Eq. (4) is valid for \u03b3min < f < \u03b3max ; \u03b3min\nis a lower cut-off for which S\u0303\u03b1 (f ) saturates, and \u03b3max is\nan upper cut-off for which S\u0303\u03b1 (f ) goes to zero faster than\n1/f 2 \u2013 see below].\nAnother important class of noise spectral density arises\nwhen the environment fluctuates with a single characteristic time \u03c4c :\nS\u0303(f ) =\n\n1\n\u03b3\n,\n2\u03c0 2 f 2 + \u03b3 2\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03b3 \u2261 1/(2\u03c0\u03c4c ). This is a Lorentzian power spectrum\nand it implies S(t) = h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(0)i = e\u2212|t|/\u03c4c . Many authors refer to \u03c4c as the \"correlation time\", and to the\nLorentzian spectra as \"time correlated noise\". In the\nlimit that \u03b3 goes to infinite (\u03c4c \u2192 0), S\u0303(f ) \u2248 (2\u03c0 2 \u03b3)\u22121 is\napproximately constant for all f \u001c \u03b3. Hence \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e is\nthe \"white noise\" limit. Another important limit occurs\n1\nwhen \u03b3 \u2192 0 (\u03c4c \u2192 \u221e): In this case S\u0303(f ) \u2192 2\u03c0\n\u03b4(f ),\nsignaling a \"static\" limit.\nIt is useful to recall the basic physical picture for the\norigin of 1/f noise. It emerges from the combination of a\n\nlarge number of Lorentzian fluctuators with an exponentially wide distribution of characteristic rates \u03b3 [2, 3]. For\nexample, assume \u03b3 = \u03b3max e\u2212\u03bb , with \u03bb a random variable\nthat represents a distribution of activation energies.

(6) we see that the distribution of Lorentzian\nlinewidths \u03b3 is given by P (\u03b3) = 1/|d\u03b3/d\u03bb| = 1/\u03b3. This\nis the reason why the spectrum acquires the 1/f dependence. We may generalize this distribution to P (\u03b3) =\n1/\u03b3 \u03b1 , with \u03b1 a dimensionless exponent; carrying though\na similar derivation as in Eq. (6) leads to S\u0303(f ) \u221d 1/f \u03b1 .\nThis shows that deviations of the 1/\u03b3 distribution will\nreflect directly into a \u03b1 6= 1 exponent for the noise spectrum.\nUsually, \u03b3min is exponentially small, and the experi\u22121\nmental observation time window T is smaller than \u03b3min\n.\nIn this case the low frequency cut-off will be instead set\nby \u03b3min = T \u22121 . As the observation time T increases,\nmore low frequency fluctuators will play a role; as a result, 1/f noise has no characteristic time scale, and displays non-ergodic behavior (time averages of observables\nare non-convergent, and can not be equivalent to ensemble averages). Below we discuss how the non-ergodic\nproperty leads to an increasing neuron Fano factor as\na function of time.\nB.\n\nWhite versus 1/f noise in the superthreshold\nregime: Bursting phenomena\n\nTo compare LIF dynamics under the effect of white\nand 1/f spectra, we considered noise in the superthreshold regime (I0 > Vth /R = 4.28 \u00d7 10\u221210 A). We assumed\n\n\f4\nTABLE I. Circuit parameters used in our LIF model.

The algorithm of Appendix A was used to generate a current\ninput I(t), and Eq. (1) is integrated using the RungeKutta method. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) shows the neuron\nvoltage as a function of time, for a particular time series (the observation time window was T = 2 s). Under\nwhite noise, the spiking remains quite regular over time,\nbecause I(t) varies rapidly and most of its fluctuating\ncomponents are filtered out. On the other hand, 1/f\nnoise shows a combination of long periods of inactivity,\nwith the voltage taking a long time to reach threshold,\ntogether with periods of spike bursting where the voltage\nreaches threshold on a much shorter time scale. This is a\nresult of the fact that under 1/f noise, the current tends\nto get \"stuck\" at either small or large values.\nFigure 2 shows the interspike time interval histogram\n(ISI) for a 100,000 ensemble of time series with the same\nparameters considered in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Here we see\nthat both types of noise can cause a notable decrease in\nthe mean interspike time interval (compare to the noiseless case of a constant bias current). However, 1/f noise\nleads to a far more dramatic shift. A large portion of\nthe interspike time histogram lies significantly below the\nnoiseless interval, and a long tail is observed at large interspike times. This behavior is characteristic of bursting\n(See e.g. Chapter 16 of [1]); several spikes occur in rapid\nsuccession, followed by a longer period without spike activity.\nFigure 2 also shows the ISI for two Lorentzian noise\nspectra, with \u03b3 = 0 Hz and \u03b3 = 1/T = 0.5 Hz, where\nT = 2 s was the simulation time window for each time\nseries. Lorentzian noise with such low frequency leads\nto an ISI that is nearly as broad as the 1/f noise case;\nhowever, the Lorentzian noise cases do not display the\nlong time tail characteristic of 1/f noise. The simulations\nfor \u03b3 = 0 Hz can be compared to an exact analytical\nresult obtained using the methods of Refs. [21, 34] (See\nAppendix B). Note how the \u03b3 = 0 Hz simulations are in\nexcellent agreement with the exact result.\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nNEURON FANO FACTOR UNDER 1/f\nNOISE\nFano factor in the perfect integrate and fire\nmodel: Analytical results\n\nThe Fano factor is defined by[1]\n2\n\nF (t) =\n\nh[\u2206N (t)] i\n,\nhN (t)i\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the random variable N (t) is the number of spikes\ngenerated from t0 = 0 to t0 = t, and \u2206N (t) = N (t) \u2212\nhN (t)i. Hence, the Fano factor measures the amount\nof uncertainty in the spike train at a given time t. A\nnoiseless spike train with identical interspike time intervals yields F (t) = 0. In contrast, consider the case that\nthe spike events are uniformly distributed in the interval\n[0, t]: In this case the probability for a spike event to happen during a time interval [t0 , t0 + \u2206t] is independent of t0\nand given by \u03bc\u2206t, where \u03bc is the mean firing rate. Then\nthe resulting N (t) is a Poisson random variable uncorrelated in time (white noise) with hN (t)i = h(\u2206N )2 i = \u03bct,\nleading to F (t) = 1 at all times. In the presence of low\nfrequency noise, F (t) is known to become larger than one\n[21, 33].\nThe observation of a Fano factor much larger than one\nrules out the simple Poisson model, and suggests the presence of long time correlations in the data [1, 31]. Middleton et al. [21] derived an analytic expression for the\nFano factor of the perfect (R = \u221e) integrate and fire\nmodel subject to Lorentzian noise [Eq (5)]. At times\nmuch longer than the average interspike interval their\nresult becomes\ni\nt\n\u03c4c\nh(\u2206I 2 )i 2\u03c4c h\n(10)\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 e\u2212 \u03c4c ) ,\nFLor. (t) =\nhIi CVth\nt\nwhere h(\u2206I 2 )i = I12 is the current variance, hIi = I0\nis the bias current, \u03c4c is the correlation time of the\nLorentzian noise, C is the capacitor's voltage, and Vth\nis the threshold voltage. We emphasize that Eq. (10) assumes an input current I(t) = I0 + I1 \u03b7(t), i.e., it neglects\nthe step function used in our numerical computations\n[compare to Eq. (2)].\nHere we generalize this result to an arbitrary noise\nspectral density. An RC circuit with no leakage (R = \u221e)\nwill lead to a capacitor voltage V that always increases\nwith increasing time. In the case of the neuron, V is reset to zero when it reaches the threshold Vth . In other\nwords, the voltage is decreased by Vth each time the neuron spikes. An equivalent way to treat this reset process\nis to instead increase the threshold by an additional Vth\neach time the neuron spikes; this allows us to count the\nnumber of spikes at a given time t by simply dividing\nthe monotonically increasing V by Vth .

The noise amplitude was\nI1 = 0.1I0 , with bias current I0 slightly above threshold. Also\nshown is the case of no noise (I1 = 0), and of Lorentzian noise\nwith \u03b3 = 0 Hz and \u03b3 = 1/T = 0.5Hz, where T = 2 s was the\nsimulation time window for each time series. Note how 1/f\nhas much broader ISI, with a long time tail extending well\nbeyond its mean interspike time.\n\nThis approximation is valid at long times, t \u001d CVth /I0 ,\ni.e. times much longer than the mean interspike interval\nso that N (t) can be represented by a real number instead\nof an integer.\nThe simplicity of the perfect integrate and fire model\nlies in the fact that we do not need to consider the threshold barrier explicitly. This property relies heavily on the\nfact that the voltage of an RC circuit never decreases\nwhen R = \u221e. It is worthwhile to show how the approx-\n\nimation Eq. (11) fails in the presence of any amount of\nleakage.\nWhen R < \u221e, the mean voltage according to Eq. (1)\nis given by RI0 (1 \u2212 e\u2212t/RC ). Hence when t \u2192 \u221e the\nmean voltage saturates at RI0 , and the approximation\nof Eq. (11) would give hN (t \u2192 \u221e)i = RI0 /Vth < \u221e.\nThis is clearly an unphysical result: If the neuron spikes\nat least once, it will spike an infinite number of times\nwhen t \u2192 \u221e, and hN (t \u2192 \u221e)i must be either 0 or \u221e.\nThis unphysical saturation of hN (t)i shows why we must\ninclude the threshold barrier explicitly when dealing with\nthe leaky model; it also shows why it is so difficult to treat\nthe leaky model analytically.\nIn the absence of leakage, we have hN (t)i =\nt I0 /(CVth ), i.e. at long times the number of spikes increases indefinitely with increasing time.

(12) provides an explicit relationship between the\nFano factor and an arbitrary time correlation function.\nFor example, upon inserting S(\u03c4 ) = e\u2212|\u03c4 |/\u03c4c we recover\nEq. (10) exactly.\nA simpler expression can be derived by inserting S(t) =\n\n\f6\n2\u03c0\n\nR\n\ndf e\u2212i2\u03c0f t S\u0303(f ) into Eq.

Hence the Fano factor can be expressed as an integral over low frequency noise; the filter function F(t, f )\ndictates how much noise is \"allowed in\" at each given\ntime t. Inspecting Eq. (14) shows that it acts as a low\npass filter with bandwidth \u2248 1/(\u03c0t). In the limit t \u2192 \u221e,\nwe have f t \u001d 1 for all frequencies, and F \u2248 \u03b4(f )/t.

(12) to find the neuron Fano factor\nsubject to 1/f noise. From Eq.

Hence\nF1/f (t) increases monotonically with increasing time, until it reaches a saturation value around \u223c T / ln (T ). This\nsaturation value, however, is artifact of the finite length T\nof the experiment; it diverges as T \u2192 \u221e, i.e., when longer\ndata sets are acquired. This effect is a manifestation of\nthe non-ergodicity of 1/f noise. In stark contrast, for an\nexperimental window T > \u03c4c , the Fano factor for the simple Lorentzian noise saturates at FLor. = 2\u03c4c I12 /(CVth I0 ),\nand remains at this value regardless of whether T is\nincreased further. Assuming that this behavior carries\nover to the Leaky model, it offers one way to determine\nwhether the neuron noise is better described by 1/f or\nLorentzian spectrum. The dependence of F (t) on t is\nanother potential discriminator, as we shall see below.\nFigure 3 illustrates the relevance of the filter function\nEq.

For\neach noise spectra, the noise amplitude I1 was chosen so that\nF (t = 0.1 s) = 10 for all noise spectra. This ensures that\nat t = 0.1 s the neurons absorb the same amount of noise\npower, despite the fact that the noise spectra are quite different. Nevertheless, for times t after 0.1 s, the Fano factor\ndiffers considerably for different spectra. This occurs because\nneurons \"integrate noise\" over a bandwidth \u2248 1/(\u03c0t) as described by the filter function Eq. (14).\n\nneurons at a given time t. Here we plot the Fano factor\nF (t) for several different noise spectra, but choose each\nnoise power (proportional to I12 ) so that the Fano factor\nat a particular time t = 0.1 s is identical [F (0.1 s) = 10]\nfor all noise spectra. Hence at this particular t = 0.1 s\nthe amount of disorder on neuron response is the same\neven though we are describing neurons subject to very\ndifferent dynamical environments. Nevertheless, at times\nafter t = 0.1 s the Fano factor differs considerably for\ndifferent environments. This is a direct consequence of\nthe fact that neurons integrate noise over a bandwidth\n\u2248 1/(\u03c0t); hence, as t increases, a neuron absorbs noise\nover an increasingly narrow frequency range.

We also show the corresponding analytical approximations Eq. (17). Note how the Fano factor due to 1/f noise\nincreases logarithmically until it reaches a slight saturation\nat t = T , the \"maximal experimental time\". This behavior\nagrees qualitatively to what is observed in measurements on\nsingle visual neurons in cats and insects [31].\n\nticeably (i.e. there is increased variability in the spike\ntrain). This happens because in the presence of leakage, the neuron tends to forget past inputs that were not\nstrong enough to break the threshold barrier and returns\nto its rest state even though it received a considerable\namount of subthreshold input. This situation is dramatically different from the perfect (non-leaky) model: In\nthe absence of leakage, every subthreshold stimulation\nincreases the charge of the neuron, priming it for firing.\nThe quantitative difference in Fano factor highlights the\nimportance of leakage in neuron dynamics. For example,\nnote the dramatic quantitative difference between Fano\nfactor for leaky and non-leaky cases at the level of 1% of\n1/f noise (I1 /I0 = 0.01).\nOur explicit numerical results of Fano factor subject to\n1/f noise shows that F (t) does not saturate at long times.\nThis property is consistent with the the direct measurements of neuron Fano factor presented in Teich et. al.\n(See Fig. 6 in [31]). Their experimental Fano factor increases well beyond one, and does not appear to reach\na plateau at long times. Note that previous calculations\nbased on Lorentzian noise [21, 33] have showed that the\nFano factor saturates at long times. This result is independent of whether one uses the perfect or the leaky\nintegrate and fire model.\nOne can argue that with respect to a Lorentzian noise\nmodel, the experimental data only explicitly rules out\ncases with \u03c4c < T , i.e. Lorentzian models with correlation time longer than the experimental window will not\nshow saturation. This is true, but the Lorentzian and\n\n\f8\n\n102\n\n3\n\nLeaky, I1/I0=0.1\nNon-leaky, I1/I0=0.1\nLeaky, I1/I0=0.01\nNon-leaky, I1/I0=0.01\n\n101\n\n2\n\n10\n\n101\n\n0\n\n10\n\nF(t)\n\nF(t)\n\nLeaky, I1/I0=0.1\nNon-leaky, I1/I0=0.1\nLeaky, I1/I0=0.01\nNon-leaky, I1/I0=0.01\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10-3 -2\n10\n\n10-1\n\n100\ntime (s)\n\n10-3 -2\n10\n\n101\n\n(a)Lorentzian Noise, \u03b3 = 1 Hz\n\n10-1\n\n100\ntime (s)\n\n101\n\n(b)1/f Noise, T = 100 s\n\nFIG. 6.

We consider the reaction of a neuron subject to the following stimulus,\nI(t) = \u03b8 (I1 \u03b7(t) + I0 \u03b8(t \u2212 tstep )) .\n\n(18)\n\nFor times between t = 0 and t = tstep , the current input\nis pure noise with subthreshold amplitude I1 ; at t = tstep ,\na superthreshold bias current I0 is suddenly turned on in\naddition to the noise. In the simulations below we used\ntstep = 1.5 s, I0 = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 A, and I1 = 0.3I0 . Figure 7 shows the mean fire rate averaged on 1 ms bins after\n\n120\n\nMean fire rate (Hz)\n\n1/f model predictions for F (t) differ in other respects as\nwell, which do not depend on \u03c4c or T .\nThe Fano factor F (t) for the experimental data has a\ntangent slope of 0.4 \u2212 0.5 around t \u223c 1 s in log-log plot\n(Fig. 6 of [31]). The predicted slope of the Lorentzian\nFano factor, however, is 1 for t \u001c \u03c4c (before saturation\ntakes place). This difference rules out the possibility that\nthe experimental results can be understood in terms of\nan unsaturated Lorentzian model.\nThe Fano factor under 1/f noise has a tangent slope of\napproximately 0.7 around t \u223c 1 s (Figs. 5 and 6b). Note\nthat the Fano factor increases logarithmically, so the exponent depends on particular time t chosen to measure\nthe slope. We repeated our simulation using 1/f 0.6 noise,\nand obtained results very similar to Figs. 5 and 6b, except that the slope was reduced to \u2248 0.5. This shows\nthat a LIF model subject to 1/f \u03b1 noise can provide an\nexcellent fit to experimental data of long time neuron\ndynamics, and further suggests that neuron input noise\nis better approximated by a 1/f -like spectrum, than a\nLorentzian with a single characteristic correlation time.\n\n100\n\nLor. \u03b3=0 Hz\n1/f\nLor. \u03b3=1000 Hz\nWhite\nNo Noise\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n1.48\n\n1.5\n\n1.52\n\n1.54\n\n1.56\n\n1.58\n\ntime (s)\nFIG. 7.

We also\nincluded the noiseless case for comparison. The presence of\nnoise primes the neurons to react significantly faster. The reaction time is optimal (almost instantaneous) for the \"static\"\ncase. Surprisingly, under 1/f noise the neuron response time\nis nearly optimal.\n\n100,000 time series are taken into account. The ensemble\nof time series can be thought of either an actual ensemble\nof different neurons or to a single neuron subject to statistically similar excitations at different times. In both\ncases, we can make claims of optimality on \"average\".\nIn the absence of noise, the LIF neuron takes 43 ms to\nrespond. The quickest response is obtained in the case\nof Lorentzian noise with \u03b3 = 0 Hz, that is equivalent\nto S\u0303(f ) = \u03b4(f )/(2\u03c0), the static limit discussed in section II A.

(color online) Histogram of first spike times under\na step excitation subject to various types of noise. In the\ncase of white noise, it takes 30 ms for 1% of the neurons to\nspike for the first time. The situation is markedly different\nfor the static case (Lorentzian with \u03b3 = 0 Hz) and for 1/f\nnoise. Here some neurons respond almost immediately, while\nothers take a long time to spike; note the long time tail in the\ndistributions for Lor. 0 Hz and 1/f noise.\n\nnot change in time, and is equivalent to a bias current\nwith amplitude picked from a Gaussian distribution. The\nresponse under 1/f noise lags behind the static case by\nonly \u2248 5 ms, i.e., it is nearly optimal. Both static and\n1/f noise reach their steady state much faster when compared to other types of noise. Lorentzian noise with rolloff frequency \u03b3 = 1000 Hz is intermediate between white\nand 1/f noise. Clearly, the response time improves as\nthe noise gets dominated by low frequency components.\nIn order to elucidate the mechanism by which noise\nsensitizes neuron response time, we present two additional figures. Figure 8 shows a histogram of first spike\ntimes. Under white noise conditions, it takes approximately 30 ms for 1% of the neurons to spike for the first\ntime. On the other hand, it takes only 8 ms for 1% of the\n1/f noise neurons to spike and a mere 2.5 ms for 1% of\nstatic noise (i.e. Lorentzian \u03b3 = 0) neurons to spike for\nthe first time. Neurons subject to 1/f noise and the \u03b3 = 0\nstatic noise have a much wider distribution of first spike\ntimes. Some neurons spike almost immediately, while\nothers take a long time to spike \u2013 note the extended tail\nin the distributions. This broad distribution implies a\ngreater variability in the neuronal interspike interval and\na degradation of any information coded therein. Extreme\nlow frequency noise (1/f and \u03b3 = 0) result in a trade off\nbetween reliability and rapid response.\nFigure 9 sheds light on the origin of this effect, by\nplotting the distribution of neuron voltages just before\nthe step stimulus is applied. Here we see why the static\ncase is optimal: The distribution of neuron voltages is\nnearly flat, and extends close to threshold. Hence, when\nthe stimulus is applied, a significant amount of \"primed\nneurons\" will reach threshold almost instantly.

Note that for the static case (Lor. 0 Hz) and\nfor the 1/f noise case, a significant fraction of neurons have\nquite high voltage. Hence these neurons will reach threshold\nmuch faster, explaining how noise can \"prime\" neurons for a\nfast response time.\n\nvoltage distribution for 1/f noise is not flat, it is broad\nand extends all the way to high voltages. Similar to the\nstatic case, the presence of a tail extending near threshold\nimplies that a significant number of neurons are \"primed\"\nby 1/f noise; these neurons will react nearly instantly to\nthe stimulus.\nWe note in passing that it is possible to engineer a\nLorentzian noise spectrum to yield a response time similar to that for 1/f noise via an appropriate choice of\n\u03b3 = 1/T , where we recall that T is the simulation time\nwindow. For T = 2 s, we find that \u03b3 = 0.5 Hz does\nthe trick, in agreement with expectations based on our\nprevious analysis of the distribution of interspike time intervals for different conditions (c.f. Fig. 2): The shortest\ninterspike time interval for a Lorentzian with \u03b3 = 0.5 Hz\nis similar to that for 1/f noise. The two distributions are\nnot identical. The ISI for the 1/f has a tail that extends\nto much longer times.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we presented analytical and numerical\ncalculations of the perfect and the leaky integrate and\nfire neuron aimed at elucidating the impact of 1/f noise\non single neuron dynamics. Though more difficult to\nanalyze than the perfect integrate and fire model that\nis commonly used in noise and network studies, our LIF\nmodel is a more realistic model of a neuron and as we\nhave shown, the inclusion of the \"leakiness\" gives rise to\nmuch higher disorder.\nWith regard to the response of the LIF to 1/f noise,\nwe find a surprising dichotomy: While it degrades the\nability to transmit information using interspike times, it\n\n\f10\nmanages to enhance the overall response time (of an ensemble of neurons) to a sudden stimulus by ensuring that\na subset of neurons are primed with a near threshold voltage.\nOur explicit numerical simulations of neuronal response to a sudden step excitation elucidates the mechanism by which noise can enhance neuron response time.\nNeuron response times were shown to be optimal under\nstatic noise (noise sharply peaked at zero frequency) because a large number of neurons are close to threshold\njust before the step stimulus arrives. This select group\nof neurons act as the alarm bells: They respond almost\ninstantly to the step stimulus. Remarkably, as we demonstrated, the case of 1/f noise is not much different; the\ndistribution for neuron voltages just before stimulus also\nhas a long tail extending towards threshold. These results\nallude to a possible explanation for why the brain is populated by an astronomically large number of neurons. It\nmay well be an evolutionary adaptation designed to take\nadvantage of the ambient noise to enhance the probability\nof survival. Neuron redundancy enables faster response\ntimes in the presence of low frequency noise, which in\nturn allows an animal to react quickly to a sudden danger.\nHowever, the apparently beneficial feature noted above\ndoes not come without cost. The 1/f noise trades off\nspeed for reliability by introducing much more variability\nin the properties of the resulting spike train. We quantify this uncertainty using the Fano factor. Our analysis\nof the Fano factor reveals that in the presence of 1/f\nnoise, this measure of disorder increases logarithmically\nas a function of time. On a positive note, we find an\nexcellent qualitative agreement between Fano factor for\nthe 1/f noise and the Fano factor derived from laboratory results of experiments with single neurons [31, 32].\nSpecifically, the latter also rises monotonically well beyond one and shows no evidence for saturation. This\nagreement suggests that the neuron input noise is better\napproximated by a scale-free 1/f -like spectrum than the\nmore commonly invoked low frequency Lorentzian spectrum.\nThe rate at which the Fano factor for a Lorentzian\nspectrum grows with time prior to saturation is F (t) \u221d t,\nindependent of \u03b3. Moreover, the Lorentzian Fano factor\nalways tends to a plateau at long times [21, 33]. Both\ntendencies are at odds with the behavior of the experimentally measured Fano factor regardless of whether the\nLorentzian spectrum is fine-tuned to yield a response\ntime similar to that of 1/f noise. We note that these\nclaims can be definitively tested by repeating the experiments of Teich et al.[31] with increasingly longer experimental time windows T .\nThe logarithmically rising Fano factor reflects the fact\nthat the long time spike dynamics is dominated either by\nperiods of extended inactivity or by periods of aggressive\nbursting. This behavior is due to the lack of ergodicity\nin 1/f noise, i.e., the fact that it lacks a characteristic\ncorrelation time. Not surprisingly, therefore, the neuron\n\ndynamics in the presence of 1/f noise is very different\nfrom that due to Lorentzian noise. As an aside, we note\nthat the degree of uncertainty is also substantially greater\nin the leaky model than in the non-leaky (perfect) case.\nThese conclusions are consistent with the observation\nthat some neurons seem to spike in a very irregular fashion. The temporal gaps of a spike train has much larger\ninformation capacity and for this reason, there is considerable body of work arguing that neurons use the timing\nintervals to encode information. Loss of reliability due\nto low frequency noise, however, limits the information\ncapacity of the spike trains [22]. On the other hand, research has shown that in certain cases neurons can spike\nwith high degree of reproducibility [35]. Whether the\norigin of highly reproducible spike patterns is due to extremely low noise at the single neuron level, or due to a\nnetwork effect that compensates for the noise remains to\nbe seen. A more interesting possibility is that the various\nfunctional regions of the brain may have evolved different strategies for managing ambient noise, depending on\nfunction and associated information capacity demands.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for supporting this work.\n\nAppendix A: Numerical simulation of Gaussian\nnoise with arbitrary spectral density\n\nTo simulate the noise used in Eq. (2) we used a variation of the efficient algorithm proposed by Timmers and\nKoenig [36]. Consider the time window from t = 0 to t =\nT . Define a discrete set of N time instants tm = n\u2206t/2,\nwhere n = 0, 1, . . . , 2N \u2212 1 and \u2206t = T /N . Choosing N\nas a power of 2 allows the use of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, with significant speed up. The associated set of \"lower half\" frequencies are fm = m/T , with\nm = 0, 1, . . . , N , and the \"upper half frequencies\" are\nfm = (2N \u2212 m)/T for m = N + 1, N + 2, . . . , 2N \u2212 1.\nWe are now ready to state the algorithm that generates\nindividual real-valued time series \u03b7(tm ) (\u03b7\u0303(f ) are their\nFourier transforms):\n1. Set \u03b7\u0303(f0 ) = 0;\nq\n2. For each m = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, set \u03b7\u0303 = ei\u03c0rm S\u0303(fm ),\nwhere rm is a random number in the interval [0, 1);\nq\n3. Set \u03b7\u0303(fN ) = S\u0303(fN );\n4. Set \u03b7\u0303(fN +m ) equal to the complex conjugate of\n\u03b7\u0303(fN \u2212m ) for all m = 1, . . . , N ;\n5. Finally, take the inverse Fourier transform of \u03b7\u0303(fm ).\nThe resulting \u03b7(tm ) realizes an individual time se-\n\n\f11\nries of the Gaussian process with noise spectrum\nS\u0303(fm ).\nFigure 10 depicts three example time series: white\nnoise, 1/f noise, and Lorentzian with half-width \u03b3 =\n10 Hz. We simulated 100,000 of these time series and\nstudied their amplitude distribution and noise spectra [Eq. (3)]. Figure 11 demonstrates that the noise\namplitudes are distributed according to a Gaussian,\nand Fig. 12 computes the ensemble average of their\ncorrelation function, S(t) = h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(0)i. The latter\nhave the expected forms: For white noise, S(t) =\nsin (2\u03c0\u03b3max t)/(2\u03c0\u03b3max t), for 1/f noise, S(t) \u2248 1 \u2212 [CE +\nln(\u03b3max t)]/ln(\u03b3max /\u03b3min ) (CE = 0.5772 is the EulerMascheroni constant), and S(t) = e\u2212\u03b3t for Lorentzian\nnoise.\n\nAppendix B: Exact calculation of the interspike\ninterval histogram for the LIF model subject to\nstatic noise\n\nIn the presence of leakage, the voltage is obtained by\nsolving Eq.
