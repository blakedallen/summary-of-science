I NTRODUCTION .\nSome spectral properties of the two-particle Schr\u00f6dinger operators are studied\nin [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 7].\nThe fundamental difference between multiparticle discrete and continuous Schr\u00f6dinger operators is that in the discrete case the analogue of the Laplasian \u2212\u2206 is\nnot rotationally invariant.\nDue to this fact, the Hamiltonian of a system does not separate into two parts,\none relating to the center-of-motion and other one to the internal degrees of freedom. In particular, such a handy characteristics of inertia as mass is not available.\nMoreover, such a natural local substituter as the effective mass-tensor (of a ground\nstate) depends on the quasi-momentum of the system and, in addition, it is only\nsemi-additive (with respect to the partial order on the set of positive definite matrices). This is the so-called excess mass phenomenon for lattice systems (see, e.g.,\n[10] and [11]): the effective mass of the bound state of an N -particle system is\ngreater than (but, in general, not equal to) the sum of the effective masses of the\nconstituent quasi-particles.\nThe two-particle problem on lattices can be reduced to an effective one-particle\nproblem by using the Gelfand transform instead: the underlying Hilbert space\nl2 ((Zd )2 ) is decomposed to a direct von Neumann integral, associated with the\nrepresentation of the discrete group Zd by the shift operators on the lattice and\nthen the total two-body Hamiltonian appears to be decomposable as well. In contrast to the continuous case, the corresponding fiber Hamiltonians hd (k) associated\nwith the direct decomposition depend parametrically on the internal binding k, the\nquasi-momentum, which ranges over a cell of the dual lattice. As a consequence,\ndue to the loss of the spherical symmetry of the problem, the spectra of the family\nDate: November 3, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nZ. I.

We emphasize that the authors of [4] considered more general class of two-particle discrete\nHamiltonians interacting via a short-range pair potentials.\nIt is also worth to mention that two-particle discrete operator h3 (k), for some\nvalues of the quasi-momentum k 6= 0 may generate a \"rich\" infinite discrete spectrum outside its essential spectrum and these eigenvalues accumulate at the edge\nof its essential spectrum (see [3]).\nIn this paper, we explore the some spectral properties of some d-dimensional\ntwo-particle discrete Schr\u00f6dinger operator hd (k) = hd0 (k) + v, k \u2208 Td , k being\nthe two-particle quasi-momentum (see (2.2)), corresponding to the energy operator\nH d of the system of two quantum particles moving on the d-dimensional lattice\nZd with the short-range potential v. In the case k \u2208 Td \\ (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)d , we establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for existence of infinite number eigenvalues of\nthe operator hd (k) (Theorem 3.4).\nWe now describe the organization of the present paper. In Sec. 2 describe\nthe two-particle Hamiltonians in the coordinate representation, introduce the twoparticle quasi-momentum, and decompose the energy operator into the von Neumann direct integral of the fiber Hamiltonians hd (k), thus providing the reduction\nto the effective one-particle case\nIn Section 3 in case the particles have (no) equal masses we obtain the finiteness\nof the discrete spectrum of hd (k) for all (k \u2208 Td ) k \u2208 Td \\ (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)d , provided\nthat the Hamiltonian hd (0) has finite discrete spectrum (Theorem 3.2) and prove\nthe main result of this paper, Theorem 3.4, in the case k \u2208 Td \\ (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)d .\nIn Appendix 3.2, for readers convenience, in the case k \u2208 M = Td \\ (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0)d\nwe give an example that the infiniteness of the discrete spectrum of hd (k) depends\non k \u2208 M .\nIn order to facilitate a description of the content of this paper, we briefly introduce the notation used throughout this manuscript. Let Zd be the d-dimensional\nlattice and Td be the d-dimensional torus, the cube (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]d with appropriately\nidentified sides, d \u2265 1.

For more general definitions of discrete Laplasians see [4],[15].\nRemark 2.2. Note that the free Hamiltonian H0d is a multi-dimensional LaurentToeplitz type operator defined by the function E(*, *) : (Td )2 \u2192 R1 :\n1\n1\nE(k1 , k2 ) =\n\u03b5(k1 ) +\n\u03b5(k2 ), k1 , k2 \u2208 Td ,\nm1\nm2\nwhere\nd\nX\n(1 \u2212 cos p(i) ), p = (p(1) , . . . , p(d) ) \u2208 Td .\n(2.1)\n\u03b5(p) =\ni=1\n\nThe last claim can be obtained by the Fourier transform F : l2 ((Zd )2 ) \u2192\nwhich gives the unitarity of H0d and the multiplication operator on\nL2 ((Td )2 ) by the function E(*, *). It is easy to see that the free Hamiltonian H0d is a\n\u22121\nbounded operator and its spectrum coincides with the interval [0, d(m\u22121\n1 + m2 )].\nThe total Hamiltonian H d (in the coordinate representation) of the system of\nthe two quantum particles moving on d-dimensional lattice Zd with the real-valued\npair interaction V is a self-adjoint bounded operator in the Hilbert space l2 ((Zd )2 )\nof the form\nH d = H0d + V,\nwhere\n(V f )(x1 , x2 ) = v(x1 \u2212 x2 )f (x1 , x2 ), f \u2208 l2 ((Zd )2 ),\nL2 ((Td )2 )\n\n\f4\n\nZ. I. MUMINOV\n\nwith v : Zd \u2192 R a bounded function.\nAs we note above the Hamiltonian H d does not split into a sum of a center of\nmass and relative kinetic energy as in the continuous case using the center of mass\nand relative coordinates.\nUsing the direct von Neumann integral decomposition the two-particle problem\non lattices can be reduced to an effective one-particle problem. Here we shortly\nrecall some results of [15] related to direct integral decomposition.\nThe energy operator H d is obviously commutable with the group of translations\nUs , s \u2208 Z d :\n(Us f )(x1 , x2 ) = f (x1 + s, x2 + s),\n\nf \u2208 l2 ((Zd )2 ),\n\nx1 , x2 \u2208 Z d ,\n\nfor any s \u2208 Zd .\nOne can check that the group {Us }s\u2208Zd is the unitary representation of the\nabelian group Zd in the Hilbert space l2 ((Zd )2 ).\nConsequently, we can decompose the Hilbert space l2 ((Zd )2 ) in a diagonal for\nthe operator H d direct integral whose fiber is parameterized by k \u2208 Td and consists\nof functions on l2 ((Zd )2 ) satisfying the condition\n(Us f )(x1 , x2 ) = exp(\u2212i(s, k))f (x1 , x2 ),\n\ns \u2208 Zd , k \u2208 Td .\n\nHere the parameter k is naturally interpreted as the total quasi-momentum of\nthe two-particles and is called the two-particle quasi-momentum.\nMore precisely, let us introduce the mapping F : l2 ((Zd )2 ) \u2192 l2 (Zd )\u2297L2 (Td )\nby the equality\n1 X \u2212i(s,k)\ne\nf (x1 + s, s), f \u2208 l2 ((Zd )2 ).\n(F f )(x1 , k) =\nd\n2\n(2\u03c0) s\u2208Zd\nRemark that F is the unitary mapping of the space l2 ((Zd )2 ) onto l2 (Zd ) \u2297\nand its adjoint F \u2217 : l2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ) \u2192 l2 ((Zd )2 ) defined as\nZ\n1\n\u2032\n\u2217\n(F g)(x1 , x2 ) =\ne\u2212i(x2 ,k ) g(x1 \u2212 x2 , k\u2032 )dk\u2032 , g \u2208 l2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ).\nd\n(2\u03c0) 2 \u2032 d\n\nL2 (Td )\n\nk \u2208T\n\n\u01240d\n\nIt follows that\n= F H0d F \u2217 acts in l2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ) as a multiplication by\nthe operator function hd0 (k), k \u2208 Td , acting in the Hilbert space l2 (Zd ) by\nhd0 (k)\n\nd\n\u0001\n1X\n=\n2\u03bc(0)Id \u2212 \u03bc(k(j) )T (~ej ) \u2212 \u03bc(k(j) )T \u2217 (~ej ) ,\n2\nj=1\n\nwhere\n\u03bc(y) = m1 \u22121 + m2 \u22121 e\u2212iy ,\n\ny \u2208 T1 .\n\nRemark 2.3. Note that the operator hd0 (k), k \u2208 Td , also is a multi-dimensional\nLaurent-Toeplitz type operator defined by\n1\n1\n\u03b5(p) +\n\u03b5(k \u2212 p), p \u2208 Td ,\nEk (p) =\nm1\nm2\nwhere \u03b5(*) is defined by (2.1).\n\n\fON THE DISCRETE SPECTRUM OF TWO-PARTICLE DISCRETE SCHR\u00d6DINGER OPERATORS\n\n5\n\nClearly, the operator V commutes with {Us }s\u2208Zd . As a result F V F \u2217 acts in\nl2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ) as a multiplication operator by the form\n(F V F \u2217 g)(x, k) = v(x)g(x, k),\n\ng \u2208 l2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ).\n\nConsequently, the operator \u0124 d = F H d F \u2217 acts in l2 (Zd ) \u2297 L2 (Td ) as a multiplication by the operator-function hd (k), k \u2208 Td , acting in the Hilbert space\nl2 (Zd ) in the form\n(2.2)\n\nhd (k) = hd0 (k) + v,\n\nwhere v is the multiplication operator by the function v(*) in l2 (Zd ).\nThis procedure is quite similar to the \"separation\" of motion of the center of\nmass for dispersive Hamiltonian in the continuous case.
