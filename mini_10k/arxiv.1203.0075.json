Our\nmethod formulates the Casimir effect as an interaction\nbetween effective electric and magnetic currents on the\nsurfaces of material bodies, and obtains Casimir energies, forces, and torques from the spectral properties of a\nmatrix that quantifies the interactions of these surface\ncurrents. Our final formulas for Casimir quantities-\nequations (1) below-may be derived in two distinct\nways: (a) by integrating the Maxwell stress tensor over a\nclosed bounding surface, as is commonly done in purely\nnumerical approaches to Casimir computation [1], but\nwith the distinction that here we evaluate the surface\nintegral analytically; or, alternatively, (b) by evaluating a path-integral expression for the Casimir energy,\nas is commonly done in quasi-analytical approaches to\nCasimir physics [2], but with the distinction that here we\nare not restricted to the use of geometry-specific special\nfunctions. In this paper, we present these two distinct\nderivations of our master formulas (1) and compare our\nnew approach to existing computational Casimir methods. A free, open-source software package implementing\nour method is available [3]; the technical details of this\nand other numerical implementations of our method will\nbe discussed elsewhere.\nResults obtained using our new technique have appeared in print before [4\u20138], and Refs. [4, 5] briefly\nsketched the path-integral derivation of our method, but\nomitted many details. The purposes of the present paper are to furnish a complete presentation of the path-\n\nintegral derivation and to present the alternative stresstensor derivation, which has not appeared in print before.\nBy arriving at identical formulas-our master formulas,\nequation (1)- from the two seemingly disparate starting\npoints of path integrals and stress tensors, we explicitly\ndemonstrate the equivalence of these two formulations of\nCasimir physics.\nIn particular, our demonstration of this equivalence\nfurnishes an alternative demonstration that the Maxwell\nstress tensor in dispersive media-questionable under ordinary circumstances-is in fact valid in the thermodynamic context, as has been argued on other grounds by\nPitaevskii [9], and by Philbin [10, 11] in the context of the\ncanonical quantization of macroscopic electromagnetism.\nAn algebraic equivalence similar to ours, but relating a\npath-integral expression to the energy density instead of\nthe Maxwell stress tensor, was demonstrated in Ref. [12],\nwhich used this equivalence to explain why the dispersive\nenergy density (which is valid in ordinary electrodynamics only for negligible dissipation [13]) is the appropriate\nquantity to consider in the context of thermal and quantum fluctuations. Our work does for the stress tensor\nwhat Ref. [12] does for the energy density. (An alternative approach to relating the stress-tensor picture to\nthe energy viewpoint was suggested in Ref. [14], but details were omitted; also, the method was restricted to geometries that admit a separating plane between objects,\nwhereas the method of this paper has no such restriction\nand is applicable even to geometries containing objects\nwith interpenetrating features.)\nAlthough Casimir physics has been with us for some\nseven decades [15], the past fifteen years have witnessed\na renaissance of interest in the field, driven by laboratory observations of Casimir phenomena in an increas-\n\n\f2\ningly complex variety of geometric and material configurations [16\u201320]. Whereas the theoretical methods used\nin the original Casimir prediction [15] were restricted to\nthe case of simple geometries and idealized materials, recent experimental progress has spurred the development\nof theoretical techniques for predicting Casimir forces\namong bodies of arbitrary shapes and material properties. Such general-purpose Casimir methods have typically pursued one of two general strategies.\nA first approach [2, 21\u201326] seeks to exploit geometrical symmetries by approximating Casimir quantities as\nexpansions in special functions (solutions of the scalar or\nvector Helmholtz equation in various coordinate systems)\nthat encode global geometric information in a concise\nway. (Techniques of this sort are often known as spectral\nmethods [27].) These methods have the virtue of yielding compact expressions relating Casimir energies, forces,\nand torques to linear-algebra operations (matrix inverse,\ndeterminant, and trace) on matrices describing the interactions of the global basis functions. As is commonly\ntrue for spectral methods, the expressions are rapidly\nconvergent (in the sense of obtaining accurate numerical\nresults with low-dimensional truncations of the matrices)\nfor highly symmmetric geometries, but less well-suited\nto asymmetric configurations, where the very geometric specificity encoded in the closed-form Helmholtz solutions becomes more curse than blessing and requires\nthe special-function expansions to be carried out to high\norders for even moderate numerical precision.\nAn alternative approach is a numerical implementation\nof the stress-tensor formulation of Casimir physics pioneered by Lifshitz et al. [28, 29]. Here the Casimir force\non a body is obtained by integrating the Maxwell stress\ntensor-suitably averaged over thermal and quantummechanical fluctations-over a fictitious bounding surface surrounding the body; in modern numerical approaches [1, 30\u201332] the integral is evaluated by numerical cubature (that is, as a weighted sum of integrand\nsamples) with values of the stress tensor at each cubature point computed by solving numerical electromagnetic scattering problems. As compared to the specialfunction approach, this technique has the virtue of great\ngenerality, as it allows one to take advantage of the wide\nrange of existing numerical techniques for solving scattering problems involving arbitrarily complex geometries\nand materials. The drawback is that the spatial integral over the bounding surface adds a layer of conceptual\nand computational complexity that is absent from the\nspecial-function approach.\nIn this paper we show how the best features of\nthese two approaches may be combined to yield a new\ntechnique for Casimir computations. Our fluctuatingsurface-current (FSC) approach expresses Casimir energies, forces, and torques among bodies of arbitrary geometries and material properties in terms of interactions\namong effective electric and magnetic currents flowing\non the object surfaces. The method borrows techniques\nfrom surface-integral-equation formulations of electro-\n\nmagnetic scattering [33] to represent objects entirely in\nterms of their surfaces-thus retaining the full flexibility of the numerical stress-tensor method in handling arbitrarily complex asymmetric geometries-but bypasses\nthe unwieldy numerical cubatures of the usual stresstensor approach to obtain Casimir energies, forces, and\ntorques directly from linear-algebra operations (matrix\ninverse, determinant and trace) on matrices describing\nthe interactions of the surface currents, thus retaining\nthe conceptual simplicity and computational ease of the\nusual special-function approach.\nThe FSC formulas for the zero-temperature Casimir\nenergy, force, and torque are\nZ \u221e\n~\ndet M(\u03be)\nE=\nd\u03be log\n(1a)\n2\u03c0 0\ndet M\u221e (\u03be)\nZ \u221e\nn\n\u2202M(\u03be) o\n~\nd\u03be Tr M\u22121 (\u03be) *\n(1b)\nFi = \u2212\n2\u03c0 0\n\u2202ri\nZ \u221e\nn\n~\n\u2202M(\u03be) o\nT =\u2212\nd\u03be Tr M\u22121 (\u03be) *\n(1c)\n2\u03c0 0\n\u2202\u03b8\nwhere the precise form of the matrix M(\u03be) is given in\nSection II. Readers familiar with scattering-matrix methods for Casimir computations [2, 23\u201326] will note the\nstriking similarity of our equation (1a) to the Casimir\nenergy formulas reported in those works (such as equation 5.13 of Ref. [2]); in both cases, the Casimir energy\nis obtained by integrating over the imaginary frequency\naxis, with an integrand expressed as a ratio of matrix\ndeterminants. The difference lies in the meaning of the\nmatrices in the two cases; whereas the matrix in typical scattering-matrix Casimir methods descibes the interactions of incoming and outgoing wave solutions of\nMaxwell's equations, the matrix in our equations (1) describes the interactions of surface currents flowing on the\nboundaries of the interacting objects in a Casimir geometry. This distinction has important ramifications for the\nconvenience and generality of our method.\nIn traditional scattering-matrix Casimir methods, the\nmatrix that enters equations like (1) describes interactions among the elements of a basis of known solutions\nof Maxwell's equations propagating to and from the interacting bodies. Such treatments afford a highly efficient description of scattering in the handful of geometries for which analytical solutions are available-such\nas incoming and outgoing spherical waves for spherical\nscatterers, left- and right-traveling plane waves for planar geometries, cylindrical wave for cylinders, etc.-but\nmay be particularly inefficient for describing more general objects, as, for example, if one attempts to describe\nscattering from a cube using a basis of spherical waves.\nMoreover, practical implementations of these methods require significant retooling to accommodate new shapes of\nobjects; if, for example, having formulated the method\nfor spheres, one wishes instead to treat spheroids, one\nmust recompute Maxwell solutions in a new coordinate\nsystem and reformulate the matrices in equations like (1)\nto describe the interactions of these new solutions.\n\n\f3\nIn contrast, the matrix in our equations (1) describes\nthe interactions of surface currents flowing on the surfaces\nof the interacting objects in a Casimir geometry, as discussed in detail in Section II. A crucial advantage of this\ndescription is that the basis we use to represent surface\ncurrents is arbitrary; the basis functions are not required\nto solve the wave equation or any other equation, and\nthe choice of basis is thus liberated from the underlying\nphysics of the problem-we are free to choose a basis that\nefficiently represents any given geometry. One convenient\nchoice-though by no means the only possibility-is a\nbasis of localized functions conforming to a nonuniform\nsurface-mesh discretization (Figure II A), where the mesh\nmay be automatically generated for arbitrarily complex\ngeometries [34]. A particular advantage of this type of basis is that, once we have implemented our method using\nbasis functions of this type, we can apply it to arbitrary\ngeometries with almost no additional effort; in particular, having applied the method to spheres, it is essentially\neffortless to apply it to cubes (Section VI).\nThe objective of this paper is to provide two separate derivations of the master formulas (1), one based on\nthe stress-tensor formalism and making no reference to\npath integration, and a second based on path integrals\nand making no reference to stress tensors. These derivations contain a number of theoretical innovations beyond\nthe practical usefulness of the method itself; in particular, in the stress-tensor derivation we state and prove a\nnew integral identity involving the homogeneous dyadic\nGreen's functions of Maxwell's equations (Appendix B),\nwhile in the path-integral derivation we introduce a new\nsurface-current representation of the Lagrange multipliers that constrain functional integrations over the electromagnetic field, which we expect to be a tool of general\nuse in quantum field theory.\nThe Casimir method described in this paper is closely\nrelated to the surface-integral-equation (SIE) formulation\nof classical electromagnetic theory. Although well-known\nin the engineering literature [33], this technique has not\nbeen extensively discussed in the Casimir literature, and\nfor this reason we begin in Section II with a brief review\nof SIE theory. Although the majority of this section is a\nreview of standard material, the explicit expressions for\ndyadic Green's functions that we derive in II C have not,\nto our knowledge, appeared in print before. In Sections\nIII and IV, which constitute the centerpiece of the paper, we present two separate derivations of the master\nFSC formulas (1); one derivation starts from the stresstensor approach to Casimir physics (Section III), while\nan independent derivation starts from a path-integral expression for the Casimir energy (Section IV). In Section\nV, we note an important practical simplification that follows from the structure of the matrices in equations (1).\nIn Section VI we validate our method by using it to reproduce known results, then illustrate its generality by\napplying it to geometries that would be difficult to address using existing Casimir methods. (Further examples\nof the utility of our method may be found in Refs. [4\u20138].)\n\nOur conclusions are presented in Section VII, and a number of technical details are relegated to the Appendices.\nTechnical details of practical numerical implementations,\nas well as additional computational applications, will be\ndiscussed elsewhere.\n\nII. A REVIEW OF THE\nSURFACE-INTEGRAL-EQUATION\nFORMULATION OF CLASSICAL\nELECTROMAGNETISM\n\nComputational Casimir physics is intimately related\nto the theory of classical electromagnetic scattering, and\nmany practical methods for predicting Casimir interactions are based on well-known techniques for solving scattering problems. Among the classical scattering methods\nthat have been appropriated for Casimir purposes are\nthe T-matrix method [24, 35, 36], the method of reflection coefficients [23], and the numerical finite-difference\nmethod [30, 31]. The method discussed in this paper\nderives from yet another well-known approach to scattering problems, namely, the method of surface integral\nequations (SIEs). (SIE techniques were first used for\nCasimir studies in Ref. [4], while Refs. [32, 37] presented\nan SIE-based implementation of the numerical stresstensor method.) As background for the remainder of this\npaper, in this section we review the well-known SIE procedure.\nSurface-integral techniques have a long history in electromagnetic theory [38], dating back to the equivalence\nprinciples of Love [39] and Schelkunoff [40] and the\nStratton-Chu equations [41] from the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Numerical implementation of SIEs-known as\nthe \"boundary-element method\" (BEM) or the \"method\nof moments\"-emerged in the 1970s as an alternative\nto other computational procedures such as the finitedifference method (FDM) and the finite-element method\n(FEM) [42, 43]. Whereas the FDM and the FEM proceed by numerically solving a spatially local form of\nMaxwell's equations, and thus allow treatment of materials with essentially arbitrary spatial variation of the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, the SIE\napproach takes advantage of the analytically known solutions of Maxwell's equations in homogeneous media, and\nthus in practice is most readily applicable to piecewisehomogeneous material configurations. For this reason,\nwhile the FDM and FEM have the advantage of being able to treat a wider class of materials, the SIE\nmethod exhibits significant practical advantages for the\npiecewise-homogeneous geometries typically encountered\nin Casimir studies.\nTo fix ideas and notation for the remainder of this\npaper, we here review the SIE formulation of electromagnetic scattering problems, beginning in Section II A\nwith the simplest case of perfectly electrically conducting\n(PEC) scatterers, and then generalizing in Section II B\nto the case of arbitrary materials.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic depiction of a scattering geometry in the surface-integral-equation picture. A collection of arbitrarily-shaped\nhomogeneous bodies, with frequency-dependent relative electrical properties {\u000fr , \u03bcr }, is embedded in a homogeneous medium\nwith electrical properties {\u000fe , \u03bce }. Incident radiation, characterized by electric and magnetic fields Einc , Hinc , impinges on the\nobjects to induce surface currents; for perfectly conducting objects we have only electric surface currents (K), while for general\nobjects we have equivalent electric and magnetic (N) surface currents. The goal of surface-integral-equation methods is to solve\nfor the surface-current distributions in terms of the incident fields, after which we can compute the scattered fields anywhere\nin space from the surface currents. [The dotted line indicates a fictitious bounding contour C surrounding one of the objects\nover which we integrate the Maxwell stress tensor to compute the Casimir force on that object (Section III.)]\n\nThe material of these two subsections is well-known\nand entirely standard within the computational electromagnetism literature, and is reviewed here only for completeness. However, in Section II C we extend the SIE\nformalism one step beyond what is usually done to write\nexplicit expressions [equations (20) and (23)] for scattering dyadic Green's functions in terms of the SIE matrices\nand the homogeneous dyadic Green's functions (DGFs).\nAlthough these expressions are straightforward consequences of the standard BEM procedure outlined in Sections IIA-B, to our knowledge they are appearing here\nfor the first time.\nThroughout this section we will refer to the scattering\nsituation depicted schematically in Figure 1, in which\na collection of homogeneous scatterers (with frequencydependent relative electrical properties {\u000fr , \u03bcr }) is embedded in a homogeneous medium (electrical properties\n{\u000fe , \u03bce }) and irradiated by incident radiation characterized by an incident electric field Einc .\n\nA.\n\nThe SIE Method For PEC Bodies\n\nWe first consider the case in which the scattering objects in Figure 1 are perfect conductors. An incident field\nimpinging on PEC bodies induces a tangential electric\n\ncurrent distribution K(x) on the body surfaces, which\ngives rise to a scattered field according to\nZ\nscat\nE (x) = \u0393EE,e (x, x0 ) * K(x0 ) dx0 ;\n(2)\nhere the integral extends over the surfaces of the bodies and \u0393EE,e is the homogeneous DGF for the exterior\nmedium. (Our notation for DGFs is summarized in Appendix A; throughout this section we work at a single frequency and suppress frequency arguments to E, \u0393, and\nK.) For a given incident field Einc we can solve for K by\nrequiring that the total (incident + scattered) field satisfy the appropriate boundary condition, which for PEC\nbodies is simply that the total tangential E-field vanish\nfor all points x on the body surfaces:\nh\ni\nEscat (x) + Einc (x) \u00d7 n\u0302(x) = 0.\n[Here taking the cross product with n\u0302(x), the outwardpointing surface normal at x, is simply a convenient way\nof extracting the tangential components of a vector.] Inserting (2) yields an integral equation for K(x) :\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\n\u0393EE,e (x, x0 ) * K(x0 ) dx0 \u00d7 n\u0302(x) = \u2212Einc (x) \u00d7 n\u0302(x).\n(3)\n\n\f5\nOr\n\nrth homogeneous object (exterior medium is Oe )\n\n\u03be\n\nImaginary frequency (\u03c9 = i\u03be)\n\n\u2202Or\n\nSurface of Or\n\n\u03bar\n\n\u000f0 , \u03bc0\n\nPermittivity, permeability of vacuum\n\nZ0 , Z r\n\nImaginary wavenumber in Or\nq\nq\nr\nZ0 = \u03bc\u000f00 , Z r = \u03bc\u000fr\n\n\u000fr , \u03bcr\n\nRelative permittivity, permeability of Or\n\nK(r), N(r) Electric, magnetic surface currents\n\nHomogeneous dyadic Green's function for the\nmedium interior to Or ; gives the P-field due to\na Q-current, where P,Q \u2208 {E,M} for electric and\nmagnetic fields and currents\n\nf\u03b1 (r)\n\n\u03b1th element in a set of tangential-vector\u2013valued basis functions defined on object surfaces\n\nk\u03b1 , n \u03b1\n\nExpansion coefficients for electric and magnetic\nsurface currents in the {f\u03b1 } basis\n\nM\n\nsurface-current interaction matrix, eqs.

A glossary of symbols used in this paper.\n\nEquation (3) is known as the \"electric-field integral equation (EFIE)\" [33].\nThus far all we have done is to restate the problem in\nan integral-equation form. The next step is to discretize\nthis integral equation by introducing a finite set of tangential vector-valued basis functions {f\u03b1 (x)}, defined on\nthe surfaces of the bodies, which serve a dual purpose as\nexpansion functions for surface currents and test functions for boundary conditions. As noted in Section I, an\nadvantage of SIE methods is that they place no restriction on these basis functions; in particular, the {f\u03b1 } need\nnot solve the wave equation or any other equation and\nneed not encapsulate any global information about the\nscattering geometry. Of course, if symmetries are present\nthen we may wish to choose the {f\u03b1 } in a way that reflects them-we might choose vector spherical harmonics\nfor a spherical scatterer, say, or a Fourier basis for a\nplanar scatterer-but nothing in the SIE formulation requires such a choice, and we are equally free to choose the\n{f\u03b1 } to be arbitrary polynomials, piecewise-linear functions, or any other functions we like. For scatterers of\ncomplex geometries, a particularly convenient strategy\nis to discretize object surfaces into small flat panels and\ntake the {f\u03b1 } to describe elemental currents sourced and\nsunk at panel vertices [44], as depicted in Figure II A.\nThe localized basis functions that result from such a procedure are known as \"boundary elements,\" and SIE implementations based on them are commonly known as\n\"boundary-element methods\" (BEM) or the \"method of\nmoments.\"\nHaving chosen a set of basis functions, the surface electric current distribution is approximated as a finite ex-\n\npansion in the {f\u03b1 }:\nK(x) =\n\nX\n\nk\u03b1 f\u03b1 (x).\n\n(4)\n\nThis expansion is then inserted into (3), and the inner\nproduct of that equation is taken with each member in\nthe set {f\u03b1 }, yielding one equation for each of the unknown coefficients k\u03b1 . Collecting these equations yields\na linear system of the form\nMk = v,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere k is the vector of k\u03b1 coefficients, the elements of\nthe RHS vector v describe the interactions of the basis\nfunctions with the incident field,\nZ\nv\u03b1 = \u2212\nf\u03b1 (x) * Einc (x) dx\n(6a)\nsup f\u03b1\nD\nE\n\u2261 \u2212 f\u03b1 Einc ,\n(6b)\n(where sup f\u03b1 is the support of basis function f\u03b1 ), and\nthe elements of the M matrix describe the interactions of\nthe basis functions with each other through the exterior\nmedium:\nZ\nZ\nM\u03b1\u03b2 =\ndx\ndx0 f\u03b1 (x) * \u0393EE,e (x, x0 ) * f\u03b2 (x0 )\nsup f\u03b1\n\nsup f\u03b2\n\n(7a)\nD\nE\n\u2261 f\u03b1 \u0393EE,e f\u03b2 .\n\n(7b)\n\nThe linear system (5) may be solved for the surfacecurrent expansion coefficients {k\u03b1 }, after which we can\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 2. One possible choice of expansion functions for tangential currents on object surfaces is obtained by discretizing object\nboundaries into unions of small flat panels and introducing localized basis functions describing elemental currents sourced and\nsunk at panel vertices: these are \"RWG\" basis functions, associated with each edge (pair of triangles) in the mesh [44].\n\ncompute the components of the scattered field at an arbitrary point in the exterior medium using the discretized\nform of equation (2):\nX Z\n,e\nscat\n0\n0\n0\nEi (x) =\nk\u03b1\n\u0393EE\n(8a)\nij (x, x )f\u03b1j (x ) dx\n\u03b1\n\n\u2261\n\nX\n\nsup f\u03b1\n\nD\nE\n,e\nk\u03b1 \u0393EE\n(x) f\u03b1 .\ni\n\n(8b)\n\n\u03b1\n\n[The second lines of equations (6), (7), and (8) define\nsome useful shorthand for commonly-encountered integrals; in (8b) note that the contracted index and the integrated argument to \u0393 are suppressed, while the uncontracted index and non-integrated argument are written\nout.]\n\nB.\n\nThe SIE Method For General Bodies\n\nFor PEC bodies, the mathematics of the SIE procedure\nneatly mirrors the physics of the actual situation. Indeed,\nfor good conductors at moderate frequencies it really is\ntrue that the physical induced currents are confined near\nthe object surfaces; the surface current distribution K(x)\nfor which we solve in an SIE method thus has a direct\nphysical interpretation as an induced surface current.\nThe situation is more complicated for general (nonPEC) objects, for here the physical induced currents are\n\nno longer confined to the surfaces, but instead extend\nthroughout the bulk of the object. The obvious extension of the procedure outlined above would be to introduce a volume discretization and solve a system analogous to (5) for the coefficients in an expansion of a volume\ncurrent density J(x). Such a procedure, while retaining\nthe intuitive interpretation of the quantity computed as\na physical current density, would suffer from poor complexity scaling, as the number of unknowns [and thus\nthe dimension of the linear system corresponding to (5)]\nwould scale like the volume, not the surface area, of the\nscattering objects.\nAn alternative approach is to abandon the strategy\nof solving for the physical volume sources and to solve\ninstead for equivalent surface sources that give rise to\nthe same scattered fields. The mathematical machinery underlying this approach is a vector generalization\nof Green's theorem known as the Stratton-Chu equations [41], which relate the E and H fields in the interior\nof a region to the tangential components of the fields on\nthe boundary of that region. More precisely, let \u2202Or be\nthe surface of the rth object in our geometry, and for\npoints x on \u2202Or define two tangential vector fields according to\nKeff (x) \u2261 n\u0302(x) \u00d7 H(x),\n\nNeff (x) \u2261 E(x) \u00d7 n\u0302(x) (9)\n\nwhere n\u0302 is the outward-pointing normal to \u2202Or at x and\nwhere E and H are the total fields at that that point. The\n\n\f7\nStratton-Chu equations are then the following surfaceintegral expressions for the fields inside and outside \u2202Or :\nEin = \u2212\n\nZ\n\no\nn\n\u0393EE,n * Keff + \u0393EM,n * Neff dx0\n\n(10a)\nZ\u2202Or n\no\nHin = \u2212\n\u0393ME,n * Keff + \u0393MM,n * Neff dx0 (10b)\n\u2202Or\n\nEout = Einc +\n\nZ\n\nn\no\n\u0393EE,e * Keff + \u0393EM,e * Neff dx0\n\n\u222a\u2202Or\n\nHout = Hinc +\n\nZ\n\n(11a)\nn\no\n\u0393ME,e * Keff + \u0393MM,e * Neff dx0\n\n\u222a\u2202Or\n\n(11b)\n[In equations (10\u201311), the r and e superscripts on \u0393\nlabel the homogeneous DGFs for the medium interior to\n\u2202Or and the exterior medium, respectively; the spatial\narguments to E, \u0393, K, and N are as in equation (2), but\nare suppressed here to save space.]\nNote the following differences between expressions (10)\nand (11) for the interior and exterior fields: (a) the surface integrals in the two cases differ in sign, arising from\nthe reversal of direction of the surface normal in (9); (b)\nthe \u0393 dyadics in (10) are those for the homogeneous\nmedium interior to Or , while in (11) we instead have\nthose for the the exterior medium; (c) in (10) we integrate over the single surface \u2202Or , while in (11) the integral is over the union of all object surfaces, \u222a \u2202Or (which\nwe may think of as the boundary of the exterior medium,\n\u222a \u2202Or = \u2202Oe ); (d) the incident fields contribute to expressions (11) for the exterior fields, but are absent from\nexpressions (10) for the interior fields.\nAlthough the tangential vector fields defined by (9)\nare simply the components of the E and H fields and\ndo not correspond to physical source densities, nonetheless the form of equations (10\u201311) suggests interpreting\nKeff and Neff as effective electric and magnetic surface\ncurrent densities, which, if known, would allow computation of the fields anywhere in space, just as knowledge of\nthe physical surface current K suffices in the PEC case\nto determine uniquely the full scattered field. To emphasize this analogy, we will henceforth drop the \"eff\"\ndesignation from K and N.\nAs in the PEC case, the K and N distributions are determined by requiring that the total fields satisfy appropriate boundary conditions. For non-PEC bodies these\nare simply that the tangential components of the total\nfields be continuous across material boundaries; for a\npoint x on the surface of a body we have\nh\ni\nEout (x) \u2212 Ein (x) \u00d7 n\u0302(x) = 0\n(12a)\nh\ni\nHout (x) \u2212 Hin (x) \u00d7 n\u0302(x) = 0.\n(12b)\nInserting (10-11) into (12) leads to integral equations for\nK and N that generalize equation (3) for non-PEC bodies. As in the PEC case, the next step is to discretize\n\nthese integral equations by approximating the electric\nand magnetic surface currents as expansions in a finite\nset of tangential vector-valued basis functions defined on\nthe object surfaces,\nX\nX\nK(x) =\nk\u03b1 f\u03b1 (x), N(x) = \u2212\nn\u03b1 f\u03b1 (x), (13)\nand testing the integral equations obtained from (12)\nwith each basis function. (The minus sign in the magnetic surface-current expansion is a useful convention\nthat leads to a symmetric linear system [43].) The result of this procedure is a linear system of the same general form as (5), but now enlarged to exhibit a 2x2 block\nstructure:\n!\n!\n!\nvE\nk\nMEE MEM\n=\n.\n(14)\nvM\nn\nMME MMM\nIn equation (14), the elements of the RHS vector describe\nthe interactions of the basis functions with the incident\nelectric and magnetic fields [compare equation (6)],\n!\n!\nf\u03b1 Einc\nv\u03b1E\n=\u2212\n,\n(15)\nv\u03b1M\nf\u03b1 Hinc\nwhile the elements of the M matrix describe the basis\nfunctions interacting with each other both through the\nexterior medium and through the medium interior to one\nof the scattering bodies. For example, the elements of the\nMEE block are\nD\nE\nEE\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n= f\u03b1 \u0393EE,e + \u0393EE,r f\u03b2\n(16)\nand similarly for the other blocks. (The \u0393EE,r term here\nis present only if basis functions f\u03b1 and f\u03b2 are defined on\nthe surface of the same object Or , while the \u0393EE,e term\nis present even for basis functions defined on the surfaces\nof different objects.)\nAfter solving (14), the scattered fields at an arbitrary\npoint x are obtained, in analogy to equation (8), from\nthe expansions\nE\nD\nEo\nX n D EE,e\n,e\nEiscat (x) =\nk\u03b1 \u0393i (x) f\u03b1 \u2212 n\u03b1 \u0393EM\n(x)\nf\n\u03b1\ni\n\u03b1\n\n(17a)\nE\nD\nEo\nX n D ME,e\n,e\nHiscat (x) =\nk\u03b1 \u0393i (x) f\u03b1 \u2212 n\u03b1 \u0393MM\n(x)\nf\n.\n\u03b1\ni\n\u03b1\n\n(17b)\n(These are the scattered fields in the exterior region;\nthe expressions for fields in the interior of object r are\nsimilar, but involve the homogeneous DGFs \u0393PQ,r for the\nmedium interior to object r.)\nC.\n\nExplicit SIE Expressions for Dyadic Green's\nFunctions\n\nThe discretized SIE method reviewed in the previous\ntwo subsections is typically employed as a numerical technique, with the linear systems (5) and (14) solved using\n\n\f8\nmethods of computational linear algebra and the scattered fields (8) and (17) evaluated numerically. In this\npaper, in contrast, we will use the SIE formalism in a\nsomewhat unusual way, by carrying the analytical development one step further than is commonly done. By\nexploiting the formal solution of equations (5) and (14),\nwe will obtain useful expressions for scattering dyadic\nGreen's functions in terms of the formal inverse of the\nSIE matrix M. These expressions will then be used in\nSection III to derive compact FSC expressions relating\nCasimir quantities to linear-algebraic manipulations of\nthe M matrix. Although these final expressions will ultimately be evaluated numerically, the analytical expressions derived in this subsection are an important ingredient in their derivation by stress-tensor methods. (The\nexpressions derived in this subsection are not needed for\nthe path-integral derivation of the FSC Casimir formulas.)\n\nThe PEC Case\nEE\nThe scattering dyadic Green's function Gij\n(x, x0 ) is\nthe scattered electric field at x due to a point electric\nsource at x0 (Appendix A); here we will need the case\nin which both x and x0 lie in the exterior medium. To\ncompute this quantity using the SIE technique of Section II A, we take the incident field to be the field of a\nunit-strength j-directed point electric current source at\na point x0 in the exterior medium, which is simply\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(20b)\n\nThe General Case\n\nTo obtain explicit expressions for scattering DGFs in\ngeneral geometries, we mimic the procedure followed\nabove, but now using the general SIE formalism outlined in Section II B instead of the PEC formalism of\nSectionII A. To compute G EE , we again take the incident\nfield to be the field of a unit-strength j-directed point\nelectric source at a point x0 in the exterior medium, in\nwhich case the elements of the RHS of equation (14) are\n!\n!\n,e 0\nf\u03b1 \u0393EE\n(x )\nv\u03b1E\nj\n=\n(21)\n,e 0\nv\u03b1M\nf\u03b1 \u0393ME\n(x )\nj\nThe expansion coefficients that enter into equation (17)\nare given, in analogy to equation (19), by the formal\nsolution of (14):\n!\n!\n!\nEM\nEE\nX W\u03b1\u03b2\nW\u03b1\u03b2\nV\u03b2E\nk\u03b1\n(22)\n=\nME\nMM\nW\u03b1\u03b2\nW\u03b1\u03b2\nV\u03b2M\nn\u03b1\n\u03b2\nInserting (21) and (22) into (17), and proceeding similarly for the magnetic-magnetic case, then yields the generalization of equation (20) to non-PEC geometries:\n\n,e\n0\nEiinc (x) = \u0393EE\nij (x, x ).\n\nThen the elements of the RHS vector in (5) are\nD\nE\n,e 0\nv\u03b1 = \u2212 f\u03b1 \u0393EE\n(x ) ,\nj\n\nof the scattered electric field, which has the effect of substituting \u0393ME for \u0393EE in (2).

The crucial property of\nthese expressions is that they present the inhomogeneous\nGreen's function in a fully-factorized in which factors\ndepending on x are separated from those depending on\nx0 . In thise sense, equations (20) are similar to Green'sfunction expansions for special geometries commonly encountered in the literature, such as spherical-harmonic\nexpansions for spherical geometries or Bessel-function expansions for cylindrical geometries [13, 36]; the difference,\nof course, is that (20) is applicable to arbitrary geometries, with the geometric information encoded in the W\nmatrix and the basis functions {f\u03b1 }.\n\n!\n.\n\n\f9\nIII.\n\nSTRESS-TENSOR DERIVATION OF THE\nFSC CASIMIR FORMULAS\n\nThe stress-tensor approach to Casimir physics relates Casimir forces to classical dyadic Green's functions\n(DGFs). This technique was pioneered by Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii (DLP) in the 1950s [28, 29]\nand has remained an important computational strategy\never since [45, 46]; in particular, modern numerical algorithms for computing Casimir forces between bodies\nof complex geometries have tended to use the stresstensor approach, with values for the relevant DGFs computed numerically [1, 30\u201332]. Here, after briefly reviewing the formalism relating Casimir forces to DGFs (Section III A), we will show that the concise SIE expressions\nfor the DGFs that we derived in Section II C afford a\nsignificant simplification of the usual computational procedure. In particular, we show that the surface integral\nof the stress tensor, which in previous work has typically\nbeen evaluated by numerical cubature, may in fact be\nevaluated analytically for an arbitrary closed surface of\nintegration, leaving behind a simple expression relating\nthe Casimir force to the trace of a certain matrix.\n\nA.\n\nA Review of Stress-Tensor Casimir Physics\n\nIn the stress-tensor approach, the i-directed Casimir\nforce on a body is obtained by integrating the expectation\nvalue of the Maxwell stress tensor over a closed bounding\nsurface surrounding the body:\nZ \u221e\nd\u03be\nFi =\nFi (\u03be),\n(24)\n\u03c0\n0\n\nFi (\u03be) =\n\nI D\nE\nTij (\u03be; x) n\u0302j (x) dx.\n\n(25)\n\nC\n\nHere the integration surface C may be the surface of the\nbody in question or any fictitious closed surface in space\nbounding the body (as in Figure 1), and the expectation\nvalue is taken with respect to quantum and thermal fluctuations.

In principle, the DGFs in question may be computed using any\nof the myriad available numerical techniques for classical\nscattering problems; to date, numerical Casimir investigations using both the finite-difference method [30, 31]\nand the discretized SIE method reviewed in Section\nII [32, 37] have appeared. In these studies, the surface\nintegral in (28) is evaluated by numerical cubature, with\nthe values of the integrand at each cubature point computed by solving numerical scattering problems.\nHere we proceed in a different direction. Instead of\ntaking equation (28) as the jumping-off point for a numerical investigation, we will continue the analytical development one step further by inserting our explicit SIE\nexpressions (20) and (23) into equation (28) and analyzing the result. As we will see, this step will allow us to\nevaluate the surface integral in (28) analytically, eliminating the need for numerical cubature and resulting in\na compact matrix-trace formula for the Casimir force.\nBecause the thrust of the argument is easiest to present\nin the simplest case of perfectly electrically conducting\n(PEC) bodies, we begin with that case in Section III B,\nleaving the treatment of general materials to Section\nIII C.\nB.\n\nStress-Tensor Derivation of FSC Formulas for\nPEC Objects\n\nIn Section II C we derived explicit SIE expressions for\nthe DGFs that enter into the integrand of (28); for the\ncase of PEC scatterers, the relevant expressions are equations (20). Our strategy here will be to insert these expressions into (28) and analyze the result; to facilitate\nthis procedure, it is convenient first to write equations\n\n\f10\n(20) in a slightly different form by (a) expressing the\nfour \u0393 dyadics in terms of the two G and C dyadics\n(Appendix A), and (b) writing out inner products like\n\nEE\n\u000fGij\n(x, x) = \u2212\u000f\n\nXD\n\nhf |\u0393i explicitly as integrals over the supports of the basis\nfunction f [compare equations (6), (7), and (8)].

Indeed, equations (29a)\nand (29b) are identical up to the different kernel functions (G or C) that enter into the integrals over basis functions.\nNote also that the variable x, which is the integration variable in the surface integral in (28), appears in (29) only\nthrough these kernel functions. This implies that, after inserting (29) into (28), we will again have a sum of terms\nof this same form-a sum over basis functions, with the summand involving integrals over the basis functions-and,\nmoreover, that many of the factors in this summand will be independent of the integration variable x in (28) and\nmay thus\nthe surface integral, which will now contain only factors of G and C.

In\nthis section, after first reviewing the well-known formalism for obtaining Casimir energies from constrained path\nintegrals (Section IV A), we present this alternate derivation (Section IV B).\nThe path-integral procedure presented here differs\nfrom typical path-integral treatments of Casimir phenomena in at least two ways. First, whereas many authors write the action for the electromagnetic field in\nterms of the gauge-independent E and B fields [36], or in\nterms of the four-vector potential A\u03bc in a way that depends on a specific choice of gauge (often the \"temporal\"\nor \"Weyl\" gauge A0 \u2261 0 [47]), here we write the action\nin terms of A\u03bc with a Fadeev-Popov parameter that allows arbitrary gauge choices; we verify explicitly that the\nFadeev-Popov parameter is absent from all final physical\npredictions. (This portion of our treatment is similar to\nthat of Ref. [48].)\nSecond, we introduce a new implementation of the constraint that the path integral extend only over field configurations satisfying the boundary conditions. Our representation emphasizes the continuity of the tangential\nE and H fields across the surfaces of the objects in a\nCasimir geometry, and the Lagrange multipliers that we\nintroduce to enforce the constraints have an attractive\nphysical interpretation as surface currents, thus establishing a connection to the SIE ideas reviewed above. After integrating out the photon field, we are left with functional integrals over surface-current distributions, with\nan effective action describing the interactions of these\ncurrents through the electrical media interior and exterior to the objects; upon discretization, this action\nturns out to involve precisely the same surface-current-\n\ninteraction matrix that appears in the SIE formulation\nof scattering reviewed in Section II.\n\nA.\n\nA Review of Constrained Path-Integral\nTechniques for Casimir Energies\n\nPath-integral formulations of field-fluctuation problems were pioneered by Bordag, Robaschik, and Wieczorek [48] and by Li and Kardar [49, 50] and have since\nbeen further developed by a number of authors (see\n[36, 51] for extensive surveys of recent developments.)\nIn this section we review the key steps in this approach.\n\nCasimir Energies from Constrained Path Integrals\n\nIn the presence of material boundaries, the partition\nfunction for a quantum field \u03c6 (which may be scalar, vector, electromagnetic, or otherwise, but is here assumed\nbosonic) at inverse temperature \u03b2 takes the form\nZ h\n\nZ(\u03b2) =\n\nD\u03c6(\u03c4, x)\n\ni\n\n1\n\ne\u2212 ~ S\u03b2 [\u03c6]\n\n(37)\n\nC\n\nwhere the action S\u03b2 is the spacetime integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density for the \u03c6 field,\nZ\nS\u03b2 [\u03c6] =\n\n~\u03b2\n\nZ\nd\u03c4\n\nn\no\ndx LE \u03c6(\u03c4, x) ,\n\n(38)\n\n0\n\nand where the notation [* * * ]C in (37) indicates that this\nis a constrained path integral, in which the functional\nintegration extends only over field configurations \u03c6 satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions at all material\nboundaries.\nIf the boundary conditions are time independent and\nthe Lagrangian density contains no terms of higher than\nquadratic order in \u03c6 and its derivatives, then it is convenient to introduce a Fourier series in the Euclidean time\n\n\f13\nvariable,\n\u03c6(\u03c4, x) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6n (x)e\u2212i\u03ben \u03c4 ,\n\n\u03ben =\n\nn\n\n2\u03c0n\n,\n~\u03b2\n\nwhereupon the path integral (37) factorizes into a product of contributions from individual frequencies,\nY\nZ(\u03b2) =\nZ(\u03b2; \u03ben ),\n\n\u03b1\n\nn\n\nZ h\ni\nZ(\u03b2; \u03ben ) =\nD\u03c6n (x)\n\ne\u2212S[\u03c6n ;\u03ben ] ,\n\n(39)\n\nC\n\nwith\nZ\nh\ni\nn\no\nS \u03c6n (x); \u03ben = \u03b2 dx LE \u03c6n (x)e\u2212i\u03ben \u03c4\nrepresenting the contribution to the full action (38) made\nonly by those field configurations with Euclidean-time\ndependence \u223c e\u2212i\u03ben \u03c4 .

In the zero-temperature\nlimit, the frequency sum becomes an integral, and the\nzero-temperature Casimir energy is\nZ \u221e\n~\nZ(\u03be)\nE =\u2212\nd\u03be ln\n.\n(41)\n2\u03c0 0\nZ\u221e (\u03be)\n\nwhere now the functional integration over \u03c6n is unconstrained.

The constrained functional integral over the field \u03c6\nis thus replaced by a new integral over the set of Lagrange\nmultipliers {\u03bb\u03b1 }, with an effective action S eff describing\ninteractions mediated by the original fluctuating field \u03c6.\n\n(Here and below we omit the \u03b2 argument to Z).\nRepresentation of Boundary Conditions\nEnforcing Constraints via Functional \u03b4-functions\n\nEquations (40-41) reduce the computation of Casimir\nenergies to the evaluation of constrained path integrals\n(39). In most branches of physics, the path integrals associated with physically interesting quantities are difficult\nto evaluate because the action S in the exponent contains\ninteraction terms (terms of third or higher order in the\nfields and their derivatives). In Casimir physics, on the\nother hand, the action is not more than quadratic in \u03c6,\nand the difficulty in evaluating expressions like (39) stems\ninstead from the challenge of implementing the implicit\nconstraint on the functional integration measure, arising\nfrom the boundary conditions and indicated by the [* * * ]C\nnotation in (39).\nThe innovation of Bordag [48] and of Li and Kardar [49] was to represent these constraints explicitly\nthrough the use of functional \u03b4 functions. If the boundary\nconditions on \u03c6 may be expressed as the vanishing of a set\n\nEquation (44) makes clear that the practical convenience of path-integral Casimir computations is entirely\ndetermined by the choice of the Lagrange multipliers\n{\u03bb\u03b1 } and the complexity of their effective action S eff ;\nthese, in turn, depend on the details of the boundary\nconditions imposed on the fluctuating field. For a given\nphysical situation there may be multiple ways to express\nthe boundary conditions, each of which will generally\nlead to a distinct expression for the integral in (44). Ultimately, of course, all choices must lead to equivalent\nresults, but different choices may exhibit significant differences in computational complexity and in the range of\ngeometries that can be efficiently treated. Several different representations of boundary conditions and Lagrange\nmultipliers have appeared in the literature to date.\nThe original work of Bordag et al. [48] considered QED\nin the presence of superconducting boundaries, with the\nboundary conditions taken to be the vanishing of the\n\n\f14\nnormal components of the dual field-strength tensor; in\n\u2217\nthe notation of the previous section, Lx \u03c6 = n\u0302\u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd\n(x),\nand the set of Lagrange multipliers {\u03bbx } constitutes a\nthree-component auxiliary field defined on the bounding\nsurfaces. The method is applicable to the computation\nof electromagnetic Casimir energies, but the treatment\nwas restricted to the case of parallel planar boundaries.\nLi and Kardar [49, 50] considered a scalar field satisfying Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on a\nprescribed boundary manifold. Here again the boundary\nconditions amount to the vanishing of a local operator\napplied to \u03c6, Lx \u03c6 = \u03c6(x) (Dirichlet) or Lx \u03c6 = |\u2202\u03c6/\u2202n|x\n(Neumann), and we have one Lagrange multiplier \u03bb(x)\nfor each point on the boundary manifold. In this case it is\ntempting to interpret \u03bb(x) as a scalar source density, confined to the boundary surfaces and with a self-interaction\ninduced by the fluctuations of the \u03c6 field. This formulation was capable, in principle, of handling arbitrarilyshaped boundary surfaces, but was restricted to the case\nof scalar fields.\nThe technique of Refs. [49, 50] was subsequently reformulated [36, 52, 53] in a way that allowed extension\nto the case of the electromagnetic field. Whereas the\noriginal formulation imposed a local form of the boundary conditions-and took the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb(x)\nto be local surface quantities-the revised formulation\nabandons the surface-source picture in favor of an alternative viewpoint emphasizing incoming and outgoing\nelectromagnetic waves. This approach associates one Lagrange multiplier \u03bb\u03b1 to each multipole term in a multipole expansion of the EM field, with the choice of multipole basis (spherical, cylindrical, etc.) governed by the\nsymmetries of the problem; the effective action S eff then\ndescribes the interactions among multipoles.\nThe virtue of multipole expansions is that, for certain\ngeometries, a small number of multipole coefficients may\nsuffice to solve many problems of interest to high accuracy. This has long been understood in domains such as\nelectrostatics and scattering theory, and in recent years\nhas been impressively demonstrated in the Casimir context as well [36, 52, 53], where multipole expansions have\nbeen used to obtain rapidly convergent and even analytically tractable series for Casimir energies in certain\nspecial geometries. The trick, of course, is that the very\ndefinition of the multipoles already encodes a significant\namount of information about the geometry, thus requiring relatively little additional work to pin down what\nmore remains to be said in any particular situation.\nBut this blessing becomes a curse when we seek a unified formalism capable of treating all geometries on an\nequal footing. The very geometric specificity of the multipole description, which so streamlines the treatment of\ncompatible or nearly-compatible geometries, has the opposite effect of complicating the treatment of incompatible geometries; thus, whereas a basis of spherical multipoles might allow highly efficient treatment of interacting spheres or nearly-spherical bodies, it would be a\nparticularly unwieldy choice for the description of cylin-\n\nders, tetrahedra, or parallelepipeds. Of course, for each\nnew geometric configuration we could simply redefine our\nmultipole expansion and correspondingly re-implement\nthe full arsenal of computational machinery (a strategy\npursued for a dizzying array of geometries in Ref. [36]),\nbut such a procedure contradicts the spirit of a single,\ngeneral-purpose scheme into which we simply plug an arbitrary experimental geometry and turn a crank.\nInstead, the goal of designing a more general-purpose\nimplementation of the path-integral Casimir paradigm\nleads us to seek a representation of the boundary conditions that, while inevitably less efficient than spherical\nmultipoles for spheres (or cylindrical multipoles for cylinders, or ...) has the flexibility to handle all manner of surfaces within a single computational framework. This is\none motivation for the fluctuating-surface-current (FSC)\napproach to Casimir computations, whose path-integral\nderivation we now discuss.\n\nB.\n\nPath-Integral Derivation of the FSC Casimir\nFormulas\n\nAs noted above, key features of the path-integral treatment presented here include an unusual choice of action\nfor the electromagnetic field and the introduction of surface currents as Lagrange multipliers constraining the\nphoton field. After discussing these points in Sections\nIV B 1 and IV B 2, respectively, we show in Section IV B 3\nhow together they allow us to evaluate the constrained\npath integral for the Casimir energy to obtain equation\n(1a).\n\n1.\n\nEuclidean Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field\n\nThe usual (Minkowski-space) Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field is\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c9\nS=\ndx L(\u03c9, x),\n2\u03c0\n\nL(\u03c9, x) =\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u000f(\u03c9, x)|E(\u03c9, x)|2 \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c9, x)|H(\u03c9, x)|2 .\n2\n\nRewriting E and H in terms of the four-vector potential\nA\u03bc , integrating by parts, and rotating to Euclidean space\nvia the prescription {\u03c9, A0 , A0\u2217 } \u2192 {i\u03be, iA0 , iA0\u2217 } yields\na Euclidean action density of the form\nLE (\u03be, x) =\n\n\u000f(i\u03be, x) \u0010\n\u2212 \u03be 2 Ai\u2217 Ai \u2212 i\u03beA0\u2217 \u2202i Ai\n2\n\n+\n\n1\n2\u03bc(i\u03be, x)\n\n\u2212 i\u03beAi\u2217 \u2202i A0 + A0\u2217 \u2202i \u2202i A0\n\u0010\n\u0011\nAi\u2217 \u2202j \u2202j Ai \u2212 Ai\u2217 \u2202i \u2202j Aj\n\nor, introducing a convenient matrix-vector notation,\n\n\u0011\n\n\f15\n\uf8f6\u2020 \uf8ee\nA0\n1 \uf8ec A1 \uf8f7 \uf8ef\nL0E (\u03be, x) = \uf8ed 2 \uf8f8 \uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n2 A\n3\nA\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f9\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\nA0\n\uf8fa \uf8ec A1 \uf8f7\nD1 (\u03be) \u2212 D2 (\u03be) \uf8fa\n\uf8fb \uf8ed A2 \uf8f8\nA3\n\n(45)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\u221a\n\uf8f6\nA0\n\u000f\u03bc * A0\n1\n1\nA\n\uf8ecA \uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed A2 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nA2\n3\n3\nA\nA\n\uf8eb\n\n(46)\n\nand\nq\nq\nq\n\u2212\u000f\u03be 2 i \u03bc\u000f \u03be\u2202x i \u03bc\u000f \u03be\u2202y i \u03bc\u000f \u03be\u2202z\n\uf8ec q\n\uf8ec i \u000f \u03be\u2202\n1 2\n1\n1\n\uf8ec\nx\n\u03bc\n\u03bc \u2202x\n\u03bc \u2202x \u2202y\n\u03bc \u2202x \u2202z\n\uf8ec\nq\nD2 = \uf8ec\n\u000f\n1\n1 2\n1\n\uf8ec i \u03bc \u03be\u2202y \u03bc \u2202y \u2202x\n\u03bc \u2202y\n\u03bc \u2202y \u2202z\n\uf8ed q\n1\n1 2\ni \u03bc\u000f \u03be\u2202z \u03bc1 \u2202z \u2202x\n\u03bc \u2202z \u2202y\n\u03bc \u2202z\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nD1 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2212\u000f\u03be 2 +\n0\n0\n0\n\n1 2\n\u03bc\u2207\n\n0\n0\n0\n1 2\n\u2212\u000f\u03be + \u03bc \u2207\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212\u000f\u03be 2 + \u03bc1 \u22072\n0\n0\n\u2212\u000f\u03be 2 + \u03bc1 \u22072\n2\n\nThe new four-vector field A\u03bc defined by (46) will be the\nfield over which we path-integrate, and equation (45)\nis almost, but not quite, the quantity that enters into\nthe exponent of the constrained path-integral expression\n(39).

Enforcing boundary conditions via surface-current Lagrange multipliers. (a) Consider a single point x on the surface of\nan object in a Casimir geometry. The boundary conditions at x, which must be satisfied in the constrained path integral (49),\nare that the tangential components of the E and H fields be continuous as we pass from inside to outside the object [equation\n(50)]; here {t1 , t2 } are vectors tangent to the surface at x. (b) We rewrite the boundary conditions in terms of differential\noperators LE,M operating on the A field, and we introduce Lagrange multipliers {K 1 , K 2 , N 1 , N 2 } to enforce the boundary\nconditions at x; specifically, K 1 , K 2 enforce the tangential E-field continuity at x, while N 1 , N 2 enforce the tangential H-field\ncontinuity [equation (53)]. (c) Repeating this procedure for all points on the object surface, we obtain Lagrange multiplier\nfields K(x), N(x), which have an obvious interpretation as the electric and magnetic surface currents of Figure 1. Integrating\nthe photon field out of the path integral then yields an effective action describing the interactions of these surface currents\n[equations (58), (71), and (72)], leading ultimately to our fluctuating-surface-current formulas for the Casimir energy.\n\n\u03bcr (\u03be), the L operators take the form\n\uf8eb\nE,r\n\nL\n\nLM,r\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n\u2202x i\u03be 0 0\n\u000fr \u03bcr\n1\n\u2212 \u221a r r \u2202y 0 i\u03be 0\n\u000f \u03bc\n1\n\u2212 \u221a r r \u2202z 0 0 i\u03be\n\u000f \u03bc\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2212\u221a\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8ec\n1 \uf8ec\n= r\uf8ec\n0 \u2202z\n\u03bc \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0 \u2212\u2202y\n\n\u2212\u2202z\n0\n\u2202x\n\n\u2202y\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\u2212\u2202x \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n0\n\n(52a)\n\nP2\nwhere we may think of {Kx , Nx } = a=1 {K a , N a }ta as\nvectors in the tangent space to the boundary surface at x.\nAggregating the corresponding \u03b4 functions for all points\non the surface of a single object, we obtain functional\n\u03b4-functions,\nZ\nZ\n\n(52b)\n\nEquations (51) are a set of four boundary conditions for\neach point x on the surfaces of the material bodies in our\ngeometry; in the language of Section IV A, these are our\nconstraints L\u03b1 \u03c6, and to each constraint we now associate\na Lagrange multiplier.

To evaluate the functional integral over sources in (73), we approximate K and N as expansions in a\nfinite set of tangential basis functions representing surface currents flowing on the surface of the interacting Casimir\nobjects, just as we did in equation (13):\nX\nX\nK(x) =\nk\u03b1 f\u03b1 (x),\nN(x) = \u2212\nn\u03b1 f\u03b1 (x).\nWe now insert these expansions into (73) and approximate the infinite-dimensional integrals over K and N as finitedimensional integrals over the k\u03b1 and n\u03b1 coefficients:\nZ\nZ Y\nY\nDKi DNi =\u21d2 J\ndk\u03b1\ndn\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere J , the Jacobian of the variable transformation, is an unimportant constant that cancels upon taking the ratio\nin (48) (and which will not be written out in the equations below). Equation (73) now becomes simply\nZ Y\nY\nk\n\u03be k T\nZ(\u03b2, \u03be) =\ndk\u03b1\ndn\u03b1 e\u2212 2\u03b2 (n) *M(\u03be)*(n) ,\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\na finite-dimensional Gaussian integral which we evaluate immediately to obtain\nn o h\ni\u22121/2\n= # * det M(\u03be)\n\n(74)\n\n\b\nwhere M(\u03be) is nothing but the SIE matrix discussed in Section II (and, once again, # is just an irrelevant constant\ninto which the \u03be/2\u03b2 prefactor in the exponent disappears). Now finally inserting (74) into (49) and (48) leads\nimmediately back to our FSC formulae (1), and our derivation is complete.\n\nV.\n\nEQUALITY OF THE PARTIAL TRACES\n\nAn important practical simplification of the FSC formulae follows from the structure of the BEM matrices.\nRecall from (1) that the quantity that enters into the\nFSC expression for the Casimir force is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nn\n\u2202M o X \u22121 \u2202M\u03b2\u03b1\nTr M\u22121 *\n=\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n(75)\n\u2202ri\n\u2202ri\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(with a similar expression for the torque). We will show\nthat the trace in (75) neatly splits into two equal subtraces, and thus that to compute the full trace we need\nonly sum a subset of the diagonal elements of the matrix\nin curly brackets (and double the result). In practice this\nreduces the computational expense of the trace computation by a factor of two or greater.\nTo understand the physical intuition behind this simplification, note that the sum in (75) runs over the elements of our basis of surface-current expansion functions,\nwhich includes functions defined on the surfaces of each\nof the objects in our Casimir geometry. In evaluating\nthe portion of this sum contributed by basis functions\ndefined on a single object surface, we are in effect computing a sort of surface integral over the surface of that\nobject. Intuitively we might expect that, to compute the\nforce on one object, it would suffice to evaluate this surface integral over the surface of that object alone, or over\n\nthe surfaces of all other objects, but that we need not do\nboth. As we now show, this physical expectation is born\nout by the mathematics; to compute the full trace in (75)\nwe need only sum the contributions of basis functions on\nthe surface of the object on which we are computing the\nforce-and double the result.\nAs before, let the objects in our Casimir geometry be\nlabeled Or , r = 1, 2, * * * , with O1 the object on which we\nare computing the Casimir force, and let Dr be the dimension of the subblock of the M matrix corresponding\nto object Or (that is, Dr is the number of surface-current\nbasis functions defined on the surface\nof Or ). The dimenP\nsion of the full matrix is D =\nDr .\nA rigid displacement of object O1 leaves unchanged\nthe interactions between all pairs of basis functions save\nthose pairs in which precisely one basis function lives on\nO1 . We can thus split the sum in (75) into two pieces:\nX\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u22121\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2202M\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2202ri\n\n\u0015\n=\n\nD1\nX\n\nD\nX\n\n\u22121\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2202M\u03b2\u03b1\n\u2202ri\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2202M\u03b2\u03b1\n.\n\u2202ri\n\n\u03b1=1 \u03b2=D1 +1\n\n+\n\nD\nX\n\nD1\nX\n\n\u03b1=D1 +1 \u03b2=1\n\n\u22121\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u0015\n\n(76)\n\nThe first piece on the RHS here is the sum of the first\nD1 diagonal elements of the matrix M\u22121 * \u2202M\ndri , while the\nsecond piece is the sum of the remaining D\u2212D1 elements.\nBut from the fact that M is a symmetric matrix (M\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n\f21\nM\u03b2\u03b1 ) it now follows that the two pieces here are equal,\nand thus to compute the full trace we need only sum\nthe first D1 diagonal elements of M\u22121 * \u2202M\ndri (or the latter\nD \u2212D1 elements, if they are fewer) and double the result,\ni.e.\n\u0015\n\u0014\nD1\nD\nX\nX\n\u22121 \u2202M\u03b1\u03b2\n\u22121 \u2202M\nTr M *\n=2\n.\nM\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2202ri\n\u2202ri\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b2=D1 +1\n\nIn practice, a convenient way to evaluate this quantity\nis to LU-factorize the matrix M, solve the linear systems M * Xm = Bm where the vectors Xm are the first\nD1 columns of \u2202M\n\u2202ri , then extract and sum the mth elements of the vectors Bm and double the result. The\nequality of the partial traces then ensures that this operation requires just D1 linear solves, in contrast to the\nfull D solves that would be required in the absence of the\nsimplification.\nVI.\nA.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nCasimir Forces between Metallic Spheres and\nCubes\n\nTo validate our new method and demonstrate its flexibility, we first calculate the Casimir force between pairs\nof metallic particles of spherical and cubical shapes (Figure 4).\nFor the sphere-sphere case, the Casimir force may\nbe computed using scattering-matrix methods based on\na spherical-wave decomposition of the electromagnetic\nfield [52, 58], with the Casimir energy expressed in terms\nof interactions among waves labeled by the usual spherical indices {`, m}. At large values of the sphere\u2013sphere\nseparation, only waves with small values of ` are relevant,\nand in this regime Ref. [52] obtained an asymptotic power\nseries for the force, whose first four terms we have plotted in Figure 4 (lower dashed curve). At smaller values\nof the sphere\u2013sphere separation, the sum over spherical\nwaves may be evaluated numerically, as is done in Figure\n4 (hollow blue circles) with waves up to ` = 40 retained\nfor each of the two possible polarizations, corresponding\nto 2(` + 1)2 = 3362 basis functions for each sphere.\nTo perform the calculation using FSC techniques, we\ndiscretize the surfaces of the objects into small surface\npatches and expand surface currents using the localized\nbasis functions of Figure II A; in this case, the number of\nbasis functions retained in the description of the surface\ncurrents is 2976 for each sphere. As illustrated in Figure\n4, the FSC calculation (solid red circles) reproduces the\nresults of the spherical-wave calculation. Note that our\nchoice of surface-mesh basis functions allows us to concentrate more degrees of freedom in the regions where\nwe expect the surface source densities to be most rapidly\nvarying-namely, the regions of each sphere that most\nclosely approach the other sphere-while simultaneously\nusing a relatively coarse-grained representation of weakly\n\ninteracting regions. Thus already for the simple spheresphere geometry our method begins to exhibit practical\nadvantages over spherical-wave-basis methods, in which\nthe resolution can only be increased globally rather than\nlocally.\nThe FSC method really comes into its own in treating\nobjects that cannot be efficiently described by analytical Maxwell solutions, such as the case of two cubes. To\nhandle such a geometry using scattering-matrix methods,\nwe would be forced either to expand fields in and around\nthe cubes in spherical waves-an approach which would\nrequire retaining basis functions up to inordinately large\nvalues of ` except in the long-distance limit [59]-or to\nreformulate the method in a basis of Maxwell solutions\nfor cubical scatterers, for which analytical expressions\nare not available. In contrast, the FSC approach handles the geometry with no more effort than is required\nfor the sphere-sphere case (inset and solid blue circles in\nFigure 4).\nAn additional limitation of the spherical-wave approach is that it is inherently restricted to separation\ndistances large enough that the interacting objects may\nbe enclosed in non-touching, nonoverlapping spheres.\nFor the cube\u2013cube geometry pictured in Figure (4),\nthis would render the method inapplicable for distances\nL/R < 1.47, excluding much of the range plotted in the\nfigure.\n\nB.\n\nRepulsion of an anisotropic nanoparticle from a\nsquare aperture in a thin metallic plate\n\nReference [6] considered the Casimir force on an elongated nanoparticle above an aperture in a thin metallic\nplate and predicted a regime in which the force on the\nnanoparticle is repulsive. This work, as well as subsequent investigations of similar phenomena [60, 61], considered only circular apertures; here we investigate the\ncase of a square aperture (Figure 5). We consider the\nCasimir force on a cylindrical nanoparticle (lower inset),\nwhose axis coincides with the axis of a thin (20 nm) plate\nwith a 1 \u03bcm square aperture, as a function of the distance Z between the vertical center of the nanoparticle and the center of the thin plate. Both cylinder and\nplate are made of real (lossy) gold, described by a relative dielectric function \u000f(\u03be) = 1 + wp2 /[\u03be(\u03be + \u03b3)] with\n{wp , \u03b3} = {1.37*1016 , 5.23*1013 } rad/s. When the center\nof the nanoparticle is vertically aligned with the center of\nthe plate (Z = 0), the z-directed Casimir force vanishes\nby symmetry; as the nanoparticle is displaced slightly\nin the positive z direction it experiences first a repulsive\nCasimir force (shaded region of plot) which peaks near\nthe value of Z at which the nanoparticle first lies entirely\nabove the plate. As the nanoparticle is raised further\nabove the plate, the repulsive force decreases in magnitude and eventually crosses over into an attractive force\nwhose magnitude decays at large Z (unshared region of\nthe plot).\n\n\f22\n\n10000\n\n100\n\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.0001\n\n1e-06\n\n1e-08\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4. Casimir force between PEC spheres and between PEC cubes. The filled green circles indicate sphere-sphere data\ncomputed using the FSC method described in this paper, while the hollow blue circles indicate sphere\u2013sphere data computed\nusing a numerical implementation of the scattering-matrix method of Ref. [52]. (The lower dashed-line curve indicates the first\nfour terms of the asymptotic series for the sphere-sphere Casimir force reported in Ref. [52].) The filled red squares indicate\ncube-cube data computed using the FSC method described in this paper; for this geometry, scattering-matrix methods and\nindeed almost all existing Casimir methods would be unwieldy or impossible to apply. The upper dashed-line curve indicates\n2\n\u03c0 2 ~c\nthe proximity-force approximation (PFA) to the cube\u2013cube force, FPFA = 4R2 * 240L\n4 for cubes of face area 4R .\n\nThe fact that the square-hole geometry reproduces\nthe repulsion phenomenon observed in the circular-hole\ncase is not particularly surprising, but we note that this\ngeometry exhibits several features which would make\nit prohibitively expensive if not outright impossible to\ntreat using any other Casimir method of which we are\naware. In particular, the interpenetrating nature of the\nnanoparticle\u2013plate configuration would immediately render most scattering-matrix methods inapplicable. Moreover, the drastic distance in length scales between the\ntiny (20 nm diameter) cylinder and the relatively large\n(5 \u03bcm radius) plate, together with the absence of rotational symmetry, would pose severe challenges to finite-\n\ndifference methods. In contrast, the FSC method easily accomodates nonuniform surface meshes, allowing\nus to describe the nanoparticle surface as a union of\nappropriately-sized surface patches even as we use much\nlarger patches for the plate surface.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe fluctuating-surface-current (FSC) approach to\nCasimir physics, together with other recently-developed\nCasimir methods such as the finite-difference approaches [30, 31, 62, 63], constitutes an advance in the\n\n\f23\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFIG. 5. Casimir force on an elongated cylindrical nanoparticle above a square aperture in a thin plate. The upper inset (not\nto scale) shows the particle\u2013plate geometry, while the lower inset is a close-up view of the surface mesh used to represent the\nparticle. The axis of the nanoparticle (the z-axis) is perpendicular to the plane of the plate; the center of the nanoparticle lies\na distance Z above the center of the plate. In the regime 0 \u2264 Z \u2264 330 nm, the z-directed force on the nanoparticle is positive,\ni.e. the particle is repelled from the plate; the shaded portion of the graph indicates this repulsive-force regime. For Z > 185\nthe nanoparticle lies entirely above the plate and the force is thus unambiguously repulsive. Both the nanoparticle and the\nplate are made of finite-conductivity gold (see text).\n\ndevelopment of Casimir algorithms that mirrors an earlier evolution in computational electromagnetism (EM).\nIn the latter field, traditional special-function approaches\nsuch as Mie's method for spherical scattering began to be\ncomplemented in the 1960s and 70s by a host of numerical techniques that expanded the range of geometries\nthat could be accurately and efficiently treated. Today,\nnumerical techniques for general geometries coexist with\ngeometry-specific special-function approaches to constitute a rich and varied arsenal of computational EM techniques appropriate for almost any conceivable situation.\nIn the future, we expect a similar situation to prevail in the Casimir field. General-purpose methods such\n\nas the one presented here will not replace scatteringmatrix Casimir methods, any more than finite-difference\nMaxwell solvers have replaced the theory of Mie scattering; instead, methods such as our FSC technique\nwill coexist with scattering-matrix methods, augmenting\nthe toolbox of available methods available for predicting\nCasimir interactions across the gamut of geometric and\nmaterial configurations.\nAmong general-geometry numerical Casimir methods,\nthe FSC approach is unique in obtaining compact determinant and trace formulas for Casimir quantities. All\nother general-purpose numerical methods rely on numerical evaluation of a surface integral for the Casimir force\n\n\f24\nand torque (and on even more unwieldy numerical volume\nintegrations for the Casimir energy). For this reason, we\nexpect the FSC approach to be the most efficient numerical Casimir method for the piecewise-homogeneous\nmaterial configurations to which it applies.\nIn addition to the practical usefulness of the FSC\nCasimir formulas, the two independent derivations that\nwe have provided in this paper contain a number of\ntheoretical innovations that we expect to find broader\napplication. In particular, in the stress-tensor derivation we stated and proved a new integral identity involving the homogeneous dyadic Green's functions of\nMaxwell's equations (Appendix B), while in the pathintegral derivation we introduced a new type of Lagrange\nmultiplier to constrain the functional integration over the\nphoton field. We hope the latter technique will prove\nto be a generally useful tool in quantum field theory;\none possible application beyond the Casimir realm is the\nboundary dependence of entanglement entropy in the\nelectromagnetic field, a subject recently addressed for\nscalar fields [64].\nWhat challenges lie ahead for FSC Casimir computations? If the evolution of computational Casimir physics\ncontinues to mimic that of computational electromagnetism, an obvious next step will be the development of\nfast solvers [65]-algorithms that exploit physical insight\nto reduce the computational complexity of matrix manipulations in equations like (1) from O(N 3 ) to a more\ntractable scaling such as O(N log N ), where N, the dimension of the matrix, is the number of surface-current\nexpansion functions {f\u03b1 } retained in equations (4) and\n(13). Although a number of algorithms are known for\nevaluating matrix-vector products involving SIE matrices in O(N log N ) time [65], the question of how best to\nexploit such algorithms to evaluate the determinant and\ntrace in equations (1) is nontrivial. To date, all FSC\nCasimir calculations have considered problems of moderate complexity (N . 104 ), for which dense-direct linearalgebra solvers are adequate; however, future problems\nmay require going beyond this regime, in which case fast\nsolvers will be essential.\nA separate challenge is to apply FSC techniques to the\ncalculation of Casimir forces out of thermal equilibrium,\nas well as to the closely related problem of near-field radiative heat transfer. These problems, which represent\na logical next step in the study of fluctuation-induced\nforces beyond the equilibrium Casimir case, have begun very recently to be investigated using scatteringmatrix [26, 66, 67] and numerical [68] methods. A hybrid technique combining scattering-matrix ideas with\nSIE-based numerical calculations was proposed in [8], but\nwas restricted to a cylindrical-wave basis; to date there\nhas been no basis-independent surface-current formulation of nonequilibrium fluctuation problems. Could the\nFSC technique presented in this paper be modified to apply to these problems? If so, what physical insight would\nthe surface-current formulation lend, and what improvements could be achieved in the efficiency of practical cal-\n\nculations?\nIn this paper we have said almost nothing about the\npractical challenges inherent in concrete numerical implementations of the FSC formulas. Among these are (a)\nhow best to choose the surface-current basis functions\n{f\u03b1 } for a given geometry, (b) how to evaluate the multidimensional integrals that enter into the elements of the\nM matrix [such as equations (7)]; (c) how to compute\nthe matrix determinant, inverse, and trace in equations\n(1), and (d) how to evaluate the imaginary-frequency\nintegrations in equations (1), as well as the Matsubara\nsums in their finite-temperature analogues. All of these\nchallenges will be addressed in subsequent publications.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Alejandro Rodriguez for providing the scattering-matrix sphere-sphere data of Figure 4.\nThe authors are grateful for support from the SingaporeMIT Alliance Computational Engineering flagship research program.

Schematic summary of the integral identity (B5). proved in Appendix B. We consider a closed bounding surface C\nand choose two points r and r0 , which may lie both inside (left panel), both outside (center panel), or on opposite sides (right\npanel) of C. We write an expression [equation (B4)] that involves products of dyadic Green's functions (DGFs), one connecting\nr to a point x on C and a second connecting x to r0 . Then we evaluate the surface integral of this expression as x ranges over\nall of C. The answer we obtain depends on the relative positioning of r and r0 with respect to C: If the two points lie both\ninside or both outside C, the surface integral vanishes, while if the two points lie on opposite sides of C then the surface integral\nyields the derivative of a DGF connecting r to r0 .\n\nHere the G and C dyadics are those defined by equations\n(A2) and (A3); we use capital Roman letters (A, B, * * * )\nto denote contracted indices, and we are using a shorthand notation in which \u03ba arguments are suppressed and\n\nspatial arguments are replaced by superscripts,\nG1ij \u2261 Gij (\u03ba, x \u2212 r),\n\nG2ij \u2261 Gij (\u03ba, r0 \u2212 x).\n\nWe also defined a symmetrized version of I :\nI ikl (r, r0 ) = Iikl (r, r0 ) + Iilk (r0 , r)\nI\n\u2261 \u03ba2 V A (x) nA (x) dx\n\n(B3)\n\nC\n\nwith\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\nV A (x) = G1ik G2lA + G1kA G2il \u2212 \u03b4iA G1Bk G2lB \u2212 Cik\nClA \u2212 CkA\nCil2 + \u03b4iA CBk\nClB\n.\n\n(B4)\n\nThe goal of this Appendix is to demonstrate that, by appealing to the defining properties of the G and C dyadics,\nthe surface integral in (B3) can be evaluated in closed form, with the result (depicted schematically in Figure 6)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0,\nif both r, r0 lie inside C\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2202\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nGkl (r \u2212 r0 )\nif r lies inside and r0 lies outside C\n\uf8f2\n\u2202ri\n0\nI ikl (r, r ) =\n(B5)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202\n\uf8f4\n0\n0\n\uf8f4\u2212\nGkl (r \u2212 r ) if r lies outside and r lies inside C\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202ri\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\nif both r, r0 lie outside C.\n[As far as we can tell, the symmetrization in equation B3 is necessary to achieve the compact form of equation\n(B5); our attempts to evaluate the non-symmetrized I in concise form were unsuccessful.]\nFor the purposes of this Appendix it will be convenient to work in length units such that \u03ba = 1.

[Technically, in the latter case there\nis an additional \u03b4 function, which we neglect for reasons discussed in conjunction with equations (70) above.] With\nthis observation we see that (B16) is obtained from (B2) simply by taking the curl with respect to the k index, and\nthus that the J kernel is the result of the same operation applied to the I kernel:\n1\n\u03b5kAB \u2202A I iBl (r, r0 )\n\u03ba\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nCkl (r \u2212 r0 )\n\uf8f2\n\u2202ri\n=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2202\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nCkl (r \u2212 r0 )\n\uf8f4\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\u2202r\n\uf8f4\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\n\nJ ikl (r, r0 ) =\n\nif both r, r0 lie inside C\nif r lies inside and r0 lies outside C\nif r lies outside and r0 lies inside C\nif both r, r0 lie outside C.\n\n\f31\n\n[1] S.
