In this scenario, Verlinde has successfully\nderived the Newton's law of gravitation, the Einstein equations, and the law of inertia, from the entropic\npoint of view. In fact, the entropic force scenario is similar to the old idea of Jacobson [2], but also\nbeyond it in some sense. Similar entropic insight into gravity has also been made by Padmanabhan [3]\nindependently and simultaneously.\nHere we briefly mention some key points of the entropic force scenario following [1]. Motivated by\nBekenstein's argument [4], Verlinde postulated that the change in entropy near the holographic screen is\nlinear in the displacement \u2206x, namely,\n\u2206S = 2\u03c0kB\n\nmc\n\u2206x ,\nh\u0304\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of test particle, whereas kB , c and h\u0304 are Boltzmann constant, speed of light and the\nreduced Planck constant, respectively. The effective entropic force acting on the test particle due to the\nchange in entropy obeys the first law of thermodynamics\nF \u2206x = T \u2206S ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T is the temperature. If one takes the Unruh temperature T experienced by an observer in an\naccelerated frame whose acceleration is a, i.e.,\n1 h\u0304a\n,\n2\u03c0 c\n\nkB T =\n\n(3)\n\nto be the temperature associated with the bits on the holographic screen, from Eqs. (1)-(3), it is easy\nto recover the second law of Newton\nF = ma .\n\n(4)\n\nConsidering a sphere as the holographic screen, Verlinde assumed that the number of used bits on the\nholographic screen N is proportional to the area A = 4\u03c0r2 , i.e.,\nN=\n\nAc3\n.\nGh\u0304\n\n(5)\n\nAccording to the equipartition law of energy, the total energy inside the screen is\nE=\n\n1\nN kB T .\n2\n\n(6)\n\nOf course, one can identifies E with the mass M inside the screen through\nE = M c2 .\n\n(7)\n\nFrom Eqs. (1), (2), and (5)-(7), one can recover the Newton's law of gravitation\nF =G\n\nMm\n,\nr2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere G can be identified with the Newton constant now. From Eqs. (3), (4) and (8), it is easy to find\nthe gravitational acceleration\ng=\n\nGM\n,\nr2\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nand the temperature\nT =\n\nh\u0304 g\n.\nkB c 2\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\nAs shown in [1], a relativistic generalization of the presented arguments directly leads to the Einstein\nequations. We strongly refer to the original paper [1] for great details.\nSoon after Verlinde's proposal of entropic force, many relevant works appeared. For examples, Cai,\nCao and Ohta [5], Shu and Gong [6] derived the Friedmann equations from entropic force simultaneously.\nSmolin [7] derived the Newtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity. Li and Wang [8] showed that the\nholographic dark energy can arise in the entropic force scenario. Easson, Frampton and Smoot [9]\nconsidered the entropic accelerating universe and the entropic inflation. Tian and Wu [10], Myung [11]\ndiscussed the thermodynamics of black holes in the entropic force scenario. Vancea and Santos [12]\nconsidered the uncertainty principle from the point of view of entropic force. Zhang, Gong and Zhu [13],\nSheykhi [14] derived the modified Friedmann equation from the corrected entropy. Also, Modesto and\nRandono [15] discussed the corrections to Newton's law from the corrected entropy. Cai, Liu and Li [16]\nconsidered a unified model of inflation and late-time acceleration in the entropic force scenario. For other\nrelevant works to entropic force, we refer to e.g. [17\u201319, 36] and references therein.\nThe works mentioned above are in fact closely following Verlinde's proposal of entropic force [1]. To\nbe honest, here we should also mention the other works which are strongly criticizing the entropic force\nscenario. For instance, the author of [38] argued that there are some possible flaws in Verlinde's idea.\nIn [39], Culetu argued that the relativistic Unruh temperature cannot be associated with the bits on the\nscreen in the form considered by Verlinde. In [40], Hossenfelder argued that some additional assumptions\nmade by Verlinde are unnecessary and there are some gaps in Verlinde's arguments. In [41], Myung\nfound that entropic force does not always imply the Newtonian force law, and the connection between\nNewtonian cosmology and entropic force cannot be confirmed. In [42], Li and Pang found that inflation\nis inconsistent with the entropic force scenario. In [43], Lee argued that there are some inconsistencies in\nVerlinde's arguments from a classical point of view.\nSo far, we have briefly surveyed the current status of the works relevant to the entropic force scenario.\nIt is fair to say that the entropic force scenario is still in controversy. On the other hand, there is no\nbreakthrough on entropic force after Verlinde's proposal [1]. A deep insight is needed to understand the\nnature of gravity. In addition, further discussions on the entropic force scenario are also desirable. Only\nwhen more and more results on entropic force are available, one can say something conclusively at that\ntime. To this end, we would like to contribute our effort and try to learn more about the entropic force\nscenario. In this work, we will consider a modified entropic force scenario proposed by Gao [20], which\nhas some interesting features. And then, we will constrain the modified entropic force scenario with the\nlatest observational data.\nIn [20], Gao noted that statistical thermodynamics reveals the equipartition law of energy does not\nhold in the very low temperatures. Instead, as is well known, the Debye model [21, 22] is very successful\nin explaining the experimental results when the temperatures are very low. Since the equipartition law of\nenergy plays an important role in the derivation of entropic force, the entropic force should be modified for\nthe very weak gravitational fields which correspond to very low temperatures. Especially, the large-scale\nuniverse is in such an extreme weak gravitational field, and hence the modified entropic force (MEF)\nmakes sense in cosmology.\nFollowing [20], we briefly mention the key points of MEF model. Similar to the Debye model [21, 22]\nin thermodynamics, one can modify the equipartition law of energy in Eq. (6) to\nE=\n\n1\nN kB T D(x) ,\n2\n\nwhere D(x) is the Debye function which is defined by\nZ x\n3\ny3\ndy ,\nD(x) = 3\ny\nx 0 e \u22121\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nand x is related to the temperature T as\n\nx\u2261\n\nTD\n,\nT\n\n(13)\n\n\f4\nin which TD is the Debye temperature. By definition, x is positive. With the modified equipartition law\nof energy, namely Eq. (11), similar to the original entropic force, one can easily to obtain [20]\ng=\n\nGM 1\n,\nr2 D(x)\n\n(14)\n\nx=\n\nTD\ngD\n=\n,\nT\ng\n\n(15)\n\nin which (nb. Eq. (10))\n\nwhere gD \u2261 (2\u03c0 kB c/h\u0304) TD is the Debye acceleration. Actually, Eq. (14) corresponds to the modified\nNewtonian law of gravity. In the limit of strong gravitational field, g \u226b gD and hence x \u226a 1, from\nEq. (12) it is easy to find that D(x) \u2192 1 and the Newtonian gravity is recovered. On the other hand,\n4\n3\nin the limit of weak\n\u221a gravitational field, g \u226a gD and hence x \u226b 1, one can see that D(x) \u2192 \u03c0 /(5x )\nand then g \u221d 1/ r, which significantly deviates from the familiar inverse square law [20]. However, as\nargued in [20], one need not to worry about the possibility of MEF against the experimental results of\nthe inverse square law. Since these experiments testing the inverse square law were done on the Earth or\nin the solar system, which are actually in the strong gravitational fields, we have x \u226a 1 and D(x) \u2192 1,\ntherefore the deviation from the inverse square law are extremely tiny. The significant deviation from\nthe inverse square law can only occur in the very large scale in the universe where the gravitational fields\nare very weak, and hence it can escape the detection of these experiments testing the inverse square law.\nOf course, this argument relies on a small gD . We will justify it later in the present work.\nNext, we turn to the cosmological issues in the MEF Model. For convenience, we set the units kB =\nc = h\u0304 = 1 hereafter. Using the derivation method in [5, 6], one can find that the modified Raychaudhuri\nequation is given by [20]\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\u0014\nK\n3x\n4\u03c0G (\u03c1 + p) = \u2212 \u1e22 \u2212 2\n,\n(16)\n\u22122D(x) + x\na\ne \u22121\nwhere \u03c1 and p are the total energy density and total pressure of cosmic fluids, respectively; K is the\nspatial curvature of the universe; H \u2261 \u0227/a is the Hubble parameter; a = (1 + z)\u22121 is the scale factor\n(we have set a0 = 1); z is the redshift; a dot denotes the derivatives with respect to cosmic time t; the\nsubscript \"0\" indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity. Taking into account the Hawking\ntemperature T for the universe [23]\nT =\n\nH\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(17)\n\nx=\n\nHD\n,\nH\n\n(18)\n\nfrom Eqs. (13) and (15), it is easy to see that\n\nwhere HD = gD . On the other hand, the energy conservation equation still holds in the MEF model,\nnamely\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H (\u03c1 + p) = 0 .\n\n(19)\n\nFrom Eqs. (16) and (19), one can derive the corresponding Friedmann equation. It is anticipated that\nFriedmann equation is also modified, H 2 6= (8\u03c0G\u03c1)/3, due to the correction term \u22122D(x) + 3x/(ex \u2212 1)\nin Eq. (16). The MEF model is in fact a modified gravity model. Gao showed that the MEF model can\ndescribe the accelerating universe without dark energy. We refer to the original paper [20] for details.\nSince Gao has not considered the constraints on the MEF model in [20], we will try to obtain the\ncosmological constraints with the latest observational data in the next section. Further, we will discuss\nsome relevant issues of the MEF model in Sec. III. Finally, we give the brief conclusion and some\nmeaningful remarks in Sec. IV.\n\n\f5\n\n1.2\n1\n\n\u0396\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 1: The 68.3% and 95.4% confidence level contours in the \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03b6 parameter space.

This result is obtained by using the data of 557 Union2 SNIa alone.\n\nII.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE MEF MODEL\n\nIn this section, we consider the cosmological constraints on the MEF model. To this end, we firstly\nrewrite the equations to suitable forms. Notice that we consider a spatially flat universe (namely K = 0)\nthroughout this work. From Eqs. (16) and (19), we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\n3x\ndH 2 .\n(20)\n8\u03c0G d\u03c1 = 3 \u22122D(x) + x\ne \u22121\nAs in [20], we consider the universe contains only pressureless matter. So, we have \u03c1 = \u03c1m = \u03c1m0 a\u22123 =\n\u03c1m0 (1 + z)3 . Dividing 3H02 in both sides of Eq. (20), we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3x\n\u03a9m0 da\u22123 = \u22122D(x) + x\ndE 2 ,\n(21)\ne \u22121\nwhere\n\u03a9m0 \u2261\n\n8\u03c0G\u03c1m0\n,\n3H02\n\nE\u2261\n\nH\n\u03b6\n= ,\nH0\nx\n\n\u03b6\u2261\n\nHD\n.\nH0\n\n(22)\n\nNote that \u03a9m0 6= \u03c1m0 /\u03c10 = 1, because Friedmann equation has been modified in the MEF model, i.e.,\nH 2 6= 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3. By definition, \u03b6 is positive. Finally, we get the differential equation for E(z), namely\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n\u03b6\n3 \u03b6/E\ndE\n\u22122D\n+ \u03b6/E\n= 3\u03a9m0 (1 + z)2 .\n(23)\n* 2E\nE\ndz\ne\n\u22121\nIn principle, one can numerically find E(z) from this exact differential equation, and then fit it to the\nobservational data to get the constraints on the MEF model. However, we find that it consumes a large\namount of time beyond normal patience when we scan the grid points in the parameter space, mainly\ndue to the hardness of numerically solving the exact differential equation (23) in which D(\u03b6/E) is an\nintegral whose upper limit is \u03b6/E itself. Therefore, it is advisable to find a reliable approximation of the\n\n\f6\nexact differential equation (23). Note that\n\u2212 2D(x) +\n\n3x\n3\n= 1 \u2212 x + O (x2 ),\n\u22121\n4\n\nex\n\n(24)\n\nfor any small quantity x. On the other hand, in [20] one might find the hint of a small \u03b6 (notice that\nit has been chosen to be 10\u22125 in [20] for example). Together with the well-known fact that usually\nE(z) increases rapidly when z increases, \u03b6/E is a small quantity in Eq. (23). Therefore, we find that an\napproximation of the exact differential equation (23) is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\u03b6\n* 2E dE = \u03a9m0 da\u22123 .\n(25)\n1\u2212\n4E\nIntegrating Eq. (25), we have\nE2 \u2212\n\n3\n\u03b6E = \u03a9m0 a\u22123 + const.,\n2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere const. is the integral constant, which can be determined by requiring E(z = 0) = 1. Finally, we\nfind that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n3\n3\n2\n(27)\nE \u2212 \u03b6E = \u03a9m0 (1 + z) + 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a9m0 ,\n2\n2\nwhich is a quadratic equation of E in fact. Noting that E is positive, we solve Eq. (27) to get\nE(z) =\n\n3\n1\n\u03b6+\n4\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013\u0015\u001b1/2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n9 2\n3\n.\n\u03b6 + 4 \u03a9m0 (1 + z)3 + 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a9m0\n4\n2\n\n(28)\n\nObviously, when \u03b6 \u226a 1, we see that the MEF model reduces to the familiar \u039bCDM model in which\n\u0002\n\u00031/2\nE(z) = \u03a9m0 (1 + z)3 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m0 )\n. Therefore, it is not surprising that in [20] Gao found the MEF\n\u22125\nmodel with \u03b6 = 10 is degenerate to \u039bCDM model. In fact, this observation is indeed the key point to\nunderstand the reason for accelerating the universe without dark energy in the MEF model.\nIn the following, we consider the cosmological constraints on the MEF model from observational data.\nAt first, we use the observational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) alone. Recently, the Supernova\nCosmology Project (SCP) collaboration released their Union2 compilation which consists of 557 SNIa [24].\nThe Union2 compilation is the largest published and spectroscopically confirmed SNIa sample to date.\nThe data points of the 557 Union2 SNIa compiled in [24] are given in terms of the distance modulus\n\u03bcobs (zi ). On the other hand, the theoretical distance modulus is defined as\n\u03bcth (zi ) \u2261 5 log10 DL (zi ) + \u03bc0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 \u2261 42.38 \u2212 5 log10 h and h is the Hubble constant H0 in units of 100 km/s/Mpc, whereas\nZ z\ndz\u0303\nDL (z) = (1 + z)\n,\n(30)\nE(z\u0303;\np)\n0\nin which p denotes the model parameters. The \u03c72 from 557 Union2 SNIa is given by\n\u03c72\u03bc (p) =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi )]2\ni\n\n\u03c3 2 (zi )\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the corresponding 1\u03c3 error. The parameter \u03bc0 is a nuisance parameter but it is independent of\nthe data points. One can perform an uniform marginalization over \u03bc0 . However, there is an alternative\nway. Following [25, 26], the minimization with respect to \u03bc0 can be made by expanding the \u03c72\u03bc of Eq. (31)\nwith respect to \u03bc0 as\n\u03c72\u03bc (p) = \u00c3 \u2212 2\u03bc0 B\u0303 + \u03bc20 C\u0303 ,\n\n(32)\n\n\f7\n\n0.3\n0.25\n\n\u0396\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0.22\n\n0.24\n\n0.26 0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\nFIG. 2: The same as in Fig. 1, except that this result is obtained by using the combined observational data of\n557 Union2 SNIa and the distance parameter A from LSS.\n\nwhere\n\u00c3(p) =\n\nB\u0303(p) =\n\nX [\u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0, p)]2\n,\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\ni\n\nX \u03bcobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03bc0 = 0, p)\n,\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\ni\n\nC\u0303 =\n\nX\ni\n\n1\n\u03c3\u03bc2 obs (zi )\n\n.\n\nEq. (32) has a minimum for \u03bc0 = B\u0303/C\u0303 at\n\u03c7\u03032\u03bc (p) = \u00c3(p) \u2212\n\nB\u0303(p)2\n.\nC\u0303\n\n(33)\n\nSince \u03c72\u03bc, min = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc, min obviously, we can instead minimize \u03c7\u03032\u03bc which is independent of \u03bc0 . The best-fit\nmodel parameters are determined by minimizing the total \u03c72 . When SNIa is used alone, we have \u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc\nwhich is given in Eq. (33). As in [27, 28], the 68.3% confidence level is determined by \u2206\u03c72 \u2261 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min \u2264\n1.0, 2.3 and 3.53 for np = 1, 2 and 3, respectively, where np is the number of free model parameters.\nSimilarly, the 95.4% confidence level is determined by \u2206\u03c72 \u2261 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min \u2264 4.0, 6.17 and 8.02 for np = 1,\n2 and 3, respectively. In the MEF model, there are 2 free model parameters, namely \u03a9m0 and \u03b6. Note\nthat E(z) for the MEF model has been given in Eq. (28). By minimizing the corresponding \u03c72 , we find\nthe best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.2704 and \u03b6 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 , while \u03c72min = 542.683. In Fig. 1, we present the\ncorresponding 68.3% and 95.4% confidence level contours in the \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03b6 parameter space.\nNext, we add the data from the observation of the large-scale structure (LSS). Here we use the distance\nparameter A of the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak in the distribution of\nSDSS luminous red galaxies [29, 30], which contains the main information of the observations of LSS.\nThe distance parameter A is given by\n1/2\n\nA \u2261 \u03a9m0 E(zb )\u22121/3\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nzb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nzb\n\ndz\u0303\nE(z\u0303)\n\n\u00152/3\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\n\f8\nwhere zb = 0.35. In [30], the value of A has been determined to be 0.469 (ns /0.98)\u22120.35 \u00b1 0.017. Here the\nscalar spectral index ns is taken to be 0.963, which has been updated from the WMAP 7-year (WMAP7)\n2\ndata [31]. Now, the total \u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc + \u03c72LSS , where \u03c7\u03032\u03bc is given in Eq. (33), and \u03c72LSS = (A \u2212 Aobs )2 /\u03c3A\n. By\nminimizing the corresponding \u03c72 , we find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.2733 and \u03b6 = 9 \u00d7 10\u22128 , while\n\u03c72min = 542.734. In Fig. 2, we present the corresponding 68.3% and 95.4% confidence level contours in\nthe \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03b6 parameter space. Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 1, it is easy to see that the constraints become\nmuch tighter.\nThen, we further add the data from the observation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nHere we use the the shift parameter R, which contains the main information of the observations of the\nCMB [31\u201333]. The shift parameter R of the CMB is defined by [32, 33]\nZ z\u2217\ndz\u0303\n1/2\nR \u2261 \u03a9m0\n,\n(35)\nE(z\u0303)\n0\nwhere the redshift of recombination z\u2217 = 1091.3 which has been updated in the WMAP7 data [31]. The\nshift parameter R relates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface, the comoving size\nof the sound horizon at z\u2217 and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak in CMB power spectrum of\ntemperature fluctuations [32, 33]. The value of R has been updated to 1.725 \u00b1 0.018 from the WMAP7\n2\ndata [31]. Now, the total \u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc + \u03c72LSS + \u03c72CMB , where \u03c72CMB = (R \u2212 Robs )2 /\u03c3R\n. By minimizing the\n2\ncorresponding \u03c7 , we find the best-fit parameters \u03a9m0 = 0.2699 and \u03b6 = 0.0165, while \u03c72min = 542.879. In\nFig. 3, we present the corresponding 68.3% and 95.4% confidence level contours in the \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03b6 parameter\nspace. Clearly, the constraints become tighter, and the best-fit \u03b6 significantly deviates from zero.\n\n0.2\n\n\u0396\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\nFIG. 3: The same as in Fig. 1, except that this result is obtained by using the combined observational data of\n557 Union2 SNIa, the distance parameter A from LSS, and the shift parameter R from CMB.\n\nFinally, we add the 59 Hymnium Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) [28], which can be used to constrain\ncosmological models without the circularity problem. In fact, GRBs are a complementary probe to SNIa\n(see e.g. [34] and references therein), whose data points are also given in terms of the distance modulus\n\u03bcobs (zi ), similar to the case of SNIa. Therefore, the corresponding \u03c72GRB from 59 Hymnium GRBs is\nalso given in the same form of Eq. (33), but the data points are replaced by the ones of GRBs. Now,\nthe total \u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032\u03bc + \u03c72LSS + \u03c72CMB + \u03c72GRB . By minimizing the corresponding \u03c72 , we find the best-fit\nparameters \u03a9m0 = 0.2704 and \u03b6 = 0.0188, while \u03c72min = 566.12. Note that the number of the total data\n\n\f9\npoints increased by 59, this \u03c72min is still very good. In Fig. 4, we present the corresponding 68.3% and\n95.4% confidence level contours in the \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03b6 parameter space. The difference between Figs. 4 and 3 is\nsmall, mainly due to the relatively weak constraint ability of current GRBs sample. This situation will\nbe changed when more and more high-quality GRBs are available in the future.\n\n0.2\n\n\u0396\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.24\n\n0.26\n0.28\nWm0\n\n0.3\n\n0.32\n\nFIG. 4: The same as in Fig. 1, except that this result is obtained by using the combined observational data of 557\nUnion2 SNIa, the distance parameter A from LSS, the shift parameter R from CMB, and 59 Hymnium GRBs.\n\nIII.\n\nFURTHER DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn the previous section, we have obtained the cosmological constraints on the MEF model. Here, we\nwould like to continue with further discussions.\nOne of the important issues is to justify the approximate solution E(z) given in Eq. (28). For the very\nsmall \u03b6, such as the \u03b6 = 10\u22125 in [20] or even smaller, we can of course safely use the approximate solution\nE(z) given in Eq. (28). The question is when \u03b6 is not so small, can we still safely use the approximate\nsolution E(z) given in Eq. (28)? As the first example, we consider \u03b6 = 0.017 and \u03a9m0 = 0.27, which is\nnear to the best fits of the joint constraints from SNIa+LSS+CMB and SNIa+LSS+CMB+GRBs. We\ncan numerically solve the exact differential equation (23) to find the exact solution of E(z) (of course,\nthe initial condition is E(z = 0) = 1). To avoid confusion, we label the exact solution from Eq. (23) and\nthe approximate solution E(z) given in Eq. (28) as Eex and Eapp , respectively. In Fig. 5, we show the\ndifference \u2206E = Eapp \u2212 Eex and the relative difference \u2206E/E = (Eapp \u2212 Eex )/Eex for the case with\n\u03b6 = 0.017 and \u03a9m0 = 0.27. Clearly, the difference between Eapp and Eex is very small, and hence we can\nreliably use the approximate solution E(z) given in Eq. (28). Next, we consider a larger \u03b6. From Figs. 3\nand 4, one can see that the upper edges of the 95.4% confidence level contours of the joint constraints\nfrom SNIa+LSS+CMB and SNIa+LSS+CMB+GRBs extend to \u03b6 \u223c 0.2. So, we choose the case with\n\u03b6 = 0.2 and \u03a9m0 = 0.27 to be the second example. Again, we present the corresponding \u2206E and \u2206E/E\nin Fig. 6. One can see that the difference between Eapp and Eex is still fairly small, and hence we can\nalso reliably use the approximate solution E(z) given in Eq. (28). Of course, if the computational ability\nof the computer becomes more powerful, it is undoubtedly the best choice to use the exact solution Eex\nfrom numerically solving Eq. (23). When we work with a less powerful computer, it is suitable to use the\napproximate solution E(z) given in Eq. (28).\n\n\f0.0005\n\n5  \u0301 10-8\n\n0.0004\n\n4  \u0301 10-8\n\n0.0003\n\n3  \u0301 10-8\nDE \u0090 E\n\nDE\n\n10\n\n0.0002\n\n2  \u0301 10-8\n\n0.0001\n\n1  \u0301 10-8\n\n0\n\n0\n-1  \u0301 10-8\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nz\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nz\n\nFIG. 5: The difference \u2206E = Eapp \u2212 Eex and the relative difference \u2206E/E = (Eapp \u2212 Eex )/Eex for the case with\n\u03b6 = 0.017 and \u03a9m0 = 0.27. See the text for details.\n\nNext, we turn to the second issue. Although in the text below Eq. (28) we have shown the key point\nto understand the reason for accelerating the universe without dark energy in the MEF model, it is still\ndesirable to show the visualized plots. As is well known, the deceleration parameter is given by [35]\nq\u2261\u2212\n\n\u00e4\n\u1e22\ndE\n= \u22121 \u2212 2 = \u22121 + (1 + z) E \u22121\n.\n2\naH\nH\ndz\n\n(36)\n\nIn Fig. 7, we plot the reduced Hubble parameter E(z) given in Eq. (28) and the corresponding deceleration\nparameter q(z) for the cases with the best-fit parameters of the joint constraints from SNIa+LSS+CMB\n(black solid lines) and SNIa+LSS+CMB+GRBs (red dashed lines). In fact, the plot lines for both cases\nof SNIa+LSS+CMB and SNIa+LSS+CMB+GRBs are heavily overlapped. From Fig. 7, we can clearly\nsee that the deceleration parameter q crosses the transition line q = 0 at redshift zt = 0.75, and the\nuniverse can really be accelerated in the late time without dark energy. By the way, we note that the\nusual relation\ndE\n1\n2\n= (2q \u2212 1)\nweff = \u22121 + (1 + z)E \u22121\n3\ndz\n3\ndoes not hold in the MEF model, due to the fact that Friedmann equations have been modified. On the\ncontrary, q(z) given in Eq. (36) holds in any models since it comes from definition directly.\nFinally, as mentioned in Sec. I, the argument that MEF can avoid the conflict with the experiments\ntesting the inverse square law relies on a small gD . We know that gD = HD = \u03b6H0 . In [20], Gao chose a\ntiny \u03b6 = 10\u22125 for example, which can of course make a very small gD . However, as shown in this work,\nthe allowed \u03b6 can be in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b6 <\n\u223c 0.2 within 95.4% confidence level. Notice that the strength\nof gravitational fields are of order 10 N * kg\u22121 on the Earth, 10\u22124 N * kg\u22121 in the solar system [20]. For\nthe best-fit \u03b6 \u223c 10\u22122 , the corresponding gD = HD = \u03b6H0 \u223c 10\u221212 N * kg\u22121 . Even for the upper bound\n\u03b6 \u223c 10\u22121 , the corresponding gD = HD = \u03b6H0 \u223c 10\u221211 N * kg\u22121 . Therefore, on the Earth or in the\nsolar system, g \u226b gD , hence x = gD /g \u226a 1, and then we have D(x) \u2192 1. Since the experiments testing\nthe inverse square law were done on the Earth or in the solar system, the deviation from the inverse\nsquare law are extremely tiny. The significant deviation from the inverse square law can only occur in\nthe very large scale in the universe where the gravitational fields are very weak, and hence it can escape\nthe detection of the experiments testing the inverse square law which were done on the Earth or in the\nsolar system.\n\n\f11\n\n0.0005\n1.4  \u0301 10-7\n1.2  \u0301 10-7\n\n0.0004\n\n1  \u0301 10-7\nDE\n\nDE \u0090 E\n\n0.0003\n0.0002\n\n8  \u0301 10-8\n6  \u0301 10-8\n4  \u0301 10-8\n\n0.0001\n\n2  \u0301 10-8\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nz\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nz\n\n0.0025\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.0008\nDE \u0090 E\n\nDE\n\n0.003\n\n0.0015\n\n0.0006\n\n0.001\n\n0.0004\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0002\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nz\n\nz\n\nFIG. 6: The same as in Fig. 5, except for the case with \u03b6 = 0.2 and \u03a9m0 = 0.27.

We found that the key parameter \u03b6 in MEF model has been limited in a\nnarrow range 0 \u2264 \u03b6 <\n\u223c 0.2 within 95.4% confidence level. By using the important result given in Eq. (28),\nwe have clearly shown the key point to understand the reason for accelerating the universe without dark\nenergy in the MEF model. We showed the MEF model reduces to \u039bCDM model when \u03b6 \u226a 1. However,\nthe best-fit \u03b6 for the observations SNIa+LSS+CMB and SNIa+LSS+CMB+GRBs significantly deviates\nfrom zero. This indicates the new feature of MEF model different from \u039bCDM model.

(28). We plotted E(z) and q(z) as functions of redshift z,\nand clearly showed that the universe can be accelerated in late time without dark energy. Finally, we\nhave shown that MEF can avoid the conflict with the experiments testing the inverse square law.\nAfter all, some remarks are in order. In the MEF model, as shown in this work, the universe can\nbe accelerated without dark energy. The only component is dust matter. The MEF model is in fact a\nmodified gravity model, similar to the f (R) models and the braneworld models. The MEF model can be\ndegenerate to \u039bCDM model, but it has not an explicit cosmological constant in the model. This is a big\nadvantage in fact, beyond some f (R) and braneworld models in this sense.\nSecondly, we point out the possibility to extend the original MEF model. In principle, it is not necessary\nto restrict the energy component in the universe to be dust matter only. The universe can contain other\ncomponents, such as, dark energy. For example, we can consider a universe containing both dust matter\nand dark energy whose equation-of-state parameter (EoS) wX is a constant. In this case, the total energy\ndensity \u03c1 = \u03c1m + \u03c1X = \u03c1m0 a\u22123 + \u03c1X0 a\u22123(1+wX ) . Substituting into Eq. (20), we have\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n3 \u03b6/E\n\u03b6\ndE\n+ \u03b6/E\n\u22122D\n= 3\u03a9m0 (1 + z)2 + 3 (1 + wX ) \u03a9X0 (1 + z)3wX +2 ,\n(37)\n* 2E\nE\ndz\ne\n\u22121\nwhere \u03a9X0 \u2261 (8\u03c0G\u03c1X0 )/(3H02 ). Note that \u03a9m0 + \u03a9X0 6= 1, since Friedmann equation has been modified\nin the MEF model. In principle, one can numerically solve Eq. (37) to get E(z). Similar to the original\nMEF model, we find that an approximation of the exact differential equation (37) is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u03b6\n1\u2212\n* 2E dE = \u03a9m0 da\u22123 + \u03a9X0 da\u22123(1+wX ) .\n(38)\n4E\n\nIntegrating Eq. (38), we have\n3\n\u03b6E = \u03a9m0 a\u22123 + \u03a9X0 a\u22123(1+wX ) + const.,\n(39)\n2\nwhere const. is the integral constant, which can be determined by requiring E(z = 0) = 1. Finally, we\nfind that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n3\n(40)\nE 2 \u2212 \u03b6E = \u03a9m0 (1 + z)3 + \u03a9X0 (1 + z)3(1+wX ) + 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03a9X0 ,\n2\n2\nE2 \u2212\n\n\f13\nwhich is a quadratic equation of E in fact. Noting that E is positive, we solve Eq. (40) to get\nE(z) =\n\n3\n1\n\u03b6+\n4\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013\u0015\u001b1/2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n9 2\n3\n. (41)\n\u03b6 + 4 \u03a9m0 (1 + z)3 + \u03a9X0 (1 + z)3(1+wX ) + 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03a9X0\n4\n2\n\nIn fact, this is just a simple example. One can include any type of dark energy, for instance, the CPL\ndark energy whose EoS is given by wde = w0 + wa (1 \u2212 a), quintessence, phantom, k-essence, hessence,\n(generalized) Chaplygin gas, holographic/agegraphic dark energy, vector-like dark energy, spinor dark\nenergy, and so on. Therefore, we would like to give the more general formulae. In this case, the total\nenergy density \u03c1 = \u03c1m + \u03c1de = \u03c1m0 a\u22123 + \u03c1de,0 f (a), where f (a) can be any function of a which satisfies\nf (a = 1) = 1. Substituting into Eq. (20), we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n\u03b6\n3 \u03b6/E\ndE\n\u22122D\n+ \u03b6/E\n= 3\u03a9m0 (1 + z)2 \u2212 \u03a9de,0 (1 + z)\u22122 f \u2032 ,\n(42)\n* 2E\nE\ndz\ne\n\u22121\nwhere f \u2032 \u2261 df /da, and \u03a9de,0 \u2261 (8\u03c0G\u03c1de,0 )/(3H02 ). Note again that \u03a9m0 + \u03a9de,0 6= 1, since Friedmann\nequation has been modified in the MEF model. Eq. (42) is the exact differential equation, which can be\nused to find the exact E(z) numerically. Also, we give the corresponding approximate solution as\n3\n1\nE(z) = \u03b6 +\n4\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u001b1/2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n3\n9 2\n1\n3\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a9m0 \u2212 \u03a9de,0\n.\n\u03b6 + 4 \u03a9m0 (1 + z) + \u03a9de,0 f\n4\n1+z\n2\n\n(43)\n\nSimilarly, if one need to add other component, such as radiation, it is not a hard work. In fact, we can\ngive the most general formulae. In this case, the total energy density \u03c1 = \u03c10 f (a), where f (a) can be any\nfunction of a which satisfies f (a = 1) = 1. Substituting into Eq. (20), we have\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n3 \u03b6/E\n\u03b6\ndE\n+ \u03b6/E\n\u22122D\n= \u2212\u03a90 (1 + z)\u22122 f \u2032 ,\n(44)\n* 2E\nE\ndz\ne\n\u22121\nwhere \u03a90 \u2261 (8\u03c0G\u03c10 )/(3H02 ). Note again that \u03a90 6= 1, since Friedmann equation has been modified in\nthe MEF model, namely H 2 6= (8\u03c0G\u03c1)/3. Eq. (44) is the exact differential equation, which can be used\nto find the exact E(z) numerically. Also, we give the corresponding approximate solution as\n1\n3\nE(z) = \u03b6 +\n4\n2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u001b1/2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n3\n9 2\n1\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a90\n.\n\u03b6 + 4 \u03a90 f\n4\n1+z\n2\n\n(45)\n\nIn fact, noting that E = H/H0 , Eq. (45) can be regarded as the approximate modified Friedmann\nequation in the MEF model. If \u03b6 \u226a 1, Eq. (45) reduces to\nH2 =\n\n8\u03c0G\n\u03c1 + \u039beff ,\n3\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u039beff = (1 \u2212 \u03a90 ) H02 = const. is actually an effective cosmological constant. Therefore, in the\nmost general case, we can clearly reveal the implicit root to accelerate the universe in the MEF model,\nregardless of the energy components in the universe. An effective cosmological constant is the intrinsic\nfeature (we refer to e.g. [23] for a previous insight). The other exotic features of the MEF model could\nemerge only when \u03b6 significantly deviates from zero.\nThirdly, we would like to say some words on the understanding of the original entropic force model [1]\nand the modified entropic force model [20]. In fact, entropic force is just a new perspective to gravity, from\nthe thermodynamical point of view. So, the original entropic force can only recover all results of the usual\n(Newton and Einstein) gravity. The only new thing is the reversed logic which might reveal the nature\nof gravity. In the original entropic force model [1], using the fundamental assumptions Eqs. (1), (3),\n(5) and (6), Verlinde derived the Newton's law of gravitation Eq. (8) for the (non-relativistic) Euclidean\nspacetime in section 3 of [1], and also derived the Einstein gravitational equations for any (relativistic)\ncurved spacetime in section 5 of [1]. On the other hand, the Friedmann equations were derived in [5, 6]\nfor the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. There is no any mixing here. We should mention\n\n\f14\nthat both the original entropic force [1] and the modified entropic force [20] cannot be understood in\nonly non-relativistic or relativistic cases. In fact, they are equivalent to gravity itself in all cases. As the\nusual understanding, the Newton's law of gravitation is just the approximation of Einstein gravitational\nequations in the (non-relativistic) small scale limit, whereas the Friedmann equations are just the special\ncase of Einstein gravitational equations in the cosmic scale (homogeneous and isotropic spacetime). The\nsituation is similar in the modified entropic force model. Using the fundamental assumptions Eqs. (1),\n(3), (5) and (11), in [20] Gao derived the Newton's law of gravitation Eq. (14) for the (non-relativistic)\nEuclidean spacetime, and also derived the second Friedmann equation (16) for the FRW universe. Note\nthat the first Friedmann equation can be derived from the second Friedmann equation (16) and the\nenergy conservation equation (19). On the other hand, following Verlinde's derivations in section 5\nof [1], one can derive the corresponding (modified) Einstein gravitational equations for any (relativistic)\ncurved spacetime. In fact, this is just the lacked sector in the modified entropic force model. However,\nit is available in principle, although it has not been given in the literature. In the modified entropic\nforce model, there is no any mixing too. The modified Newton's law of gravitation Eq. (14) is just\nthe approximation of the (lacked but available in principle) modified Einstein gravitational equations in\nthe (non-relativistic) small scale limit, whereas the modified second Friedmann equation (16) is just the\nspecial case of the (lacked but available in principle) modified Einstein gravitational equations in the\ncosmic scale (homogeneous and isotropic spacetime).\nFourthly, we said that the MEF model is similar to f (R)-gravity or braneworld scenario. Notice that\nthey are similar only in the sense that the gravity has been modified in these models. Of course, both\nf (R)-gravity and braneworld scenario were derived from the known actions, whereas the action for MEF\nis still lacked in the literature. However, as mentioned above, following Verlinde's derivations in section 5\nof [1], in principle one can derive the corresponding (modified) Einstein gravitational equations for any\n(relativistic) curved spacetime. Once this lacked sector has been done, the explicit action is ready. Since\nthe present work focuses on cosmology in the MEF model, we leave this task to future works.\nFifthly, as mentioned in this work, in the MEF model, there is no dark energy in fact. The universe\nis matter-dominated always. The expansion of our universe is accelerated due to the fact that gravity\nhas been modified. In the non-relativistic case, there is no dark energy too, but gravity is also modified.\nHowever, as mentioned in this work, this modification to Newtonian gravity is negligible on the Earth or\nin the solar system. In the larger scale, the modified gravity is described by Eq. (14). As shown in [37],\nthe Debye entropic force can be an alternative to the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) to explain\nthe rotational velocity curves of spiral galaxies. In fact, the MEF model [20] and the Debye entropic force\nmodel [37] are very similar. So, it is anticipated that the \"non-relativistic cosmology\" of the MEF model\ncould be an alternative to dark matter, which is usually invoked to explain the rotational velocity curves\nof spiral galaxies.\nFinally, we admit that the entropic force proposed by Verlinde is based on several unproved hypotheses,\nand it is still controversial in the physical community. On the other hand, the Debye model in the\nthermodynamics has not been used in the gravity theory previously. However, in the history, many great\ntheories also appeared controversially in their beginning. Therefore, we consider that it is better to keep\nan open mind to these speculative attempts.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for quite useful comments and suggestions, which help us to improve\nthis work.
