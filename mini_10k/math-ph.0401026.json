Introduction\n2\n\nKratzer's type of molecular potential, V (x) = ( xa \u2212 12 xa2 ), has been considered to obtain\nthe molecular spectra since the early days of quantum mechanics[1]. Similar type of\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is also obtained for an electron moving in a model nonuniform\nmagnetic field Bx = 0, By = 0 and Bz = x12 [2]. We analyse a generalisation of this\npotential, V (x) = xC2 + Dx , through the method of su(1, 1) spectrum generating algebra.\nWe have obtained the bound state spectrum for this case. Here we obtain a class of\npotentials that provide similar eigenvalues. This reminds us of the situation where\nreflectionless potentials are obtained through B\u00e4cklund transforms for the scattering\nstates.\nSince symmetries and beaking of symmetries play such a crucial role in physics,\nthe enumeration of the symmetries would be helpful in understanding the role of\nsuch potentials in spontaneous symmetry breaking, for example. The group analysis\nof differential equations relevant to physics has been quite fruitful in the context of\nfinding solutions and constructing new solutions, gaining insight regarding asymptotic\nbehaviour of the solutions, integrability conditions, conservation laws etc.. There is a\nvast literature on the application of this technique to mathematics and physics[3, 4]. In\nthis paper we also perform a group analysis of the above type of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nto obtain the Lie point symmetries. Some examples of this type of analysis for charged\nparticles in the presence of specific magnetic fields have also been carried out in[9, 2] .\nIn the present case it is found that the symmetry gets enhanced for particular values\nof C and D. The resulting generators of the Lie algebra do not close under the Lie\nproduct. For a special case we obtain an interesting looking extended infinite Lie algebra.\nThis algebra has appearance similar to that of Kac - Moody - Virasoro type and the\nDolan - Grady type which arose in the study of integrable models and symmetries of\nsupersymmetric models in the presence of magnetic fields[10, 11, 12].\n2.\n\nThe quantum eigenvalues\n\nWe consider the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the form\nC\nD\nh\u03042 d2 u\n) u = Eu.\n\u2212\n2 \u2212( 2 +\n2m dx\nx\nx\n\"\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C and D are constants. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation for Kratzer's molecular\npotential is a special case of the above equation. The Kratzer molecular potential\nis of the form , in our notation,\na 1 a2\n)\n(2)\nV (x) \u221d ( \u2212\nx 2 x2\nand the eigenvalue equation had been solved by the usual series expansion method.\nThe eigenfunctions turn out to be a general type of Kummer's hypergeometric function\n1 F1 [1].\n\n\f3\n\nGroup analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\nBut energy eigenvalues for this equation can also be obtained by mapping this\nproblem to that of the spectrum generating algebra of SU(1, 1) by identifying the\ngenerators of the algebra with the (differential ) operator realization of the algebra,\nand calculating the Casimir invariant. Cordero and Ghirardi have calculated the energy\neigenvalues for such cases using the spectrum generating algebra method [5]. Though in\nthis method we directly get the eigenvalues, and not the eigenfunctions explicitly, it will\nbe seen that it is easier to find a class of potentials which give similar eigenvalues. For\ncompleteness and also for familiarisation with the notation, we give below the details of\nthe calculation.\nEquation (1) can be written as\nC\nD\nd2 u\n+ \u00ca)u = 0\n2 +( 2 +\nx\nx\ndx\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\nh\u0304\nE.\nwhere \u00ca = 2m\nThe generation of the spectrum associated with a second order differential equation\nof the form\nd2 R\n+ f (s)R = 0\n(4)\nds2\nwhere\na\n(5)\nf (s) = 2 + bs2 + c\ns\nhas been analysed by several authors [6].

We write this equation as\nu\u2032\u2032 = \u03c9(x, u, u\u2032)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\nC\nD\n+ + \u00ca)u(x).\n(36)\n2\nx\nx\nThe infinitesimal generator of the symmetry under which the differential equation does\nnot change is given by the vector field\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b7(x, u)\n(37)\nX = \u03be(x, u)\n\u2202x\n\u2202u\nand for a second order differential equation, \u03be and \u03b7 are to be determined from\n\u03c9(x, u, u\u2032) = \u2212(\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\u03c9(\u03b7,u \u2212 2\u03be,x \u2212 3u\u2032 \u03be,u ) \u2212 \u03c9,x \u03be \u2212 \u03c9,u \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c9,u\u2032 \u03b7,x + u\u2032(\u03b7,u \u2212 \u03be,x ) \u2212 u\u2032 \u03be,u\n2\n\n3\n\n+\u03b7,xx + u\u2032 (2\u03b7,xu \u2212 \u03be,xx ) + u\u2032 (\u03b7,uu \u2212 2\u03be,xu ) \u2212 u\u2032 \u03be,uu = 0\n\ni\n\n(38)\n\nwhere a prime denotes differentiation with respect to x, the partial derivative of a\nfunction by a comma followed by the variable with respect to which the derivation has\nbeen performed.\nThe symmetry condition (38) for our equation (35) is\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nC\nC\nD\nD\nD\n2C\n\u2212 ( 2 + + \u00ca)u(x) (\u03b7,u \u2212 \u03be,x ) + 3 + 2 (u\u03be) + ( 2 + + \u00ca)\u03b7\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\u0015\n\u0014\nD\nC\n+\u03b7,xx \u2212 u\u2032 3( 2 + + \u00ca)\u03be,u + 2\u03b7,xu \u2212 \u03be,xx\nx\nx\n3\n\u20322\n+u (\u03b7,uu \u2212 2\u03be,xu ) \u2212 u\u2032 \u03be,uu = 0.\n(39)\nEquating to zero the coefficients of u\u2032 3 and u\u2032 2 we get\n\u03be,uu = 0,\n\n\u03b7,uu = 2\u03be,xu\n\n(40)\n\nwhich are satisfied for\n\u03be = u\u03b1(x) + \u03b2(x),\n\n\u03b7 = u2 \u03b1\u2032 (x) + u\u03b3(x) + \u03b4(x).\n\nUsing these and equating the coefficient of u\u2032 to zero one obtains\n\u0014\n\u0015\nC\nD\n\u2032\u2032\n3u \u03b1 (x) + ( 2 + + \u00ca)\u03b1(x) + 2\u03b3 \u2032 (x) \u2212 2\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 (x) = 0.\nx\nx\nThis shows that either\n\u03b1=0\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nor \u03b1(x) satisfies the same equation as u(x) does and\n2\u03b3 \u2032 (x) = \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 (x).\n\n(44)\n\n\fGroup analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n7\n\nThis integrates to\n\u03b2 \u2032 (x)\n+\u03ba\n(45)\n2\nwhere \u03ba is a constant. The rest of the equation, after using the fact that \u03b1(x) satisfies\nthe same equation as u(x) does , becomes\nD\n4C 2D\nC\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) + 4( 2 + + \u00ca)\u03b2 \u2032 (x) \u2212 ( 3 + 2 )\u03b2(x) = 0\n(46)\nx\nx\nx\nx\nwith \u03b4(x) also obeying the same equation as u(x) does. The simplest nontrivial solution\nto this equation is\np\n(47)\n\u03b2(x) = + q\nx\nwhere p and q are constants and C ,D , and \u00ca must satisfy\n3\nD 2 = \u2212\u00ca.\n(48)\nq = 2pD,\nC=\u2212 ,\n4\nIt is now observed that the condition D 2 = \u2212\u00ca is satisfied for C = \u2212 43 if we take the\n\u221a\nsquare root to be only negative while evaluating 1 \u2212 4a and for n = 1 . Also note\nthat the symmetry is present for a particular value of the energy. It may be recalled\nthat n must be zero or a positive integer for our analysis if any meaningful eigenvalue\nis to be obtained. The above result indicates that only for n = 1 there is the symmetry\ncorresponding to \u03b2 = xp + q. So the original equation (35) has the symmetry represented\nby the vector field\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\np\n\u2202\n\u2202\np\n2 \u2032\n+ u \u03b1 (x) \u2212 u 2 + u\u03ba + \u03b4(x)\n.\n(49)\nX = u\u03b1(x) + + 2pD\nx\n\u2202x\nx\n\u2202u\nHere u, \u03b1, and \u03b4 are related to the hypergeometric functions 1 F1 which are solutions to\ngeneralised Kummer type of equations mentioned in section 2. A consequence of this is\nthat the generators do not close under the Lie product. We also note that, if, further,\nD = 21 then\n\u03b3(x) =\n\n1\n\n1\n\nu = \u03b1 = e 2 x x\u2212 2 .\nThis is to be put in (49) to get the generators. Defining\n1 \u2202\nex \u2202\n\u2202\nX = 2D , Y\u2212n = n , Z\u2212n = n\n\u2202x\nx \u2202x\nx \u2202x\nthe extended Lie algebra has the commutation relations\n\n(50)\n\n(51)\n\n[Y\u2212n , X] = nY\u2212n\u22121\n[Z\u2212n , X] = \u2212Z\u2212n + nZ\u2212n\u22121\n\n[Y\u2212n , Y\u2212m ] = (n \u2212 m)Y\u2212(n+m+1)\n\n[Z\u2212m , Y\u2212n ] = (m \u2212 n)Z\u2212(n+m+1) \u2212 Z\u2212(m+n)\n\n[Z\u2212m , Z\u2212n ] = (m \u2212 n)ex Z\u2212(n+m+1)\n\n(52)\n\nWe also find that\n\u03b2(x) =\n\ng2 g1\n+\n+ g0\nx2\nx\n\n(53)\n\n\f8\n\nGroup analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nwill satisfy the equation (46) and everything would be consistent if\ng0 = \u2212\n\n2\u00ca\ng1 ,\nD\n\ng1 = 2Dg2 ,\n\nC = \u22122.\n\n(54)\n\nThis would imply\nd2\n.\n(55)\n4\n\u221a\nThis can only be obtained if we again take the negative root of 1 \u2212 4a and n = 2.Hence\nthere is again an enhancement of symmetry at another possible eigenvalue and for\nanother value of n. The vector-field for this case is\n\u00ca = \u2212\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n2\u00ca\n\u2202\nX = u\u03b1(x) + (\n\u2212\n)g0\n\u2202x\n4\u00cax2 Dx\n#\n\"\n2\u00ca\n\u2202\n1\n2 \u2032\n+ \u2212 2 }g0 \u2212 \u03ba) + \u03b4(x)\n+ u \u03b1 (x) \u2212 u({\nDx\n\u2202u\n2\u00cax3\nand again all Lie products do not close.\nTaking\ng2 g1\ng3\n+ g0\n\u03b2(x) = 3 + 2 +\nx\nx\nx\nthe relation between gl 's with l = 0, 1, 2, and 3 , becomes\n12D\n3\ng2 ,\ng2 =\ng3 =\ng1 ,\n2D\n9\u00ca + 5D 2\n5\n\u221215\ni g0 ,\ng1 = h 32D\u00ca\nC=\n.\n4\n+\n2D\n2\n\n(56)\n\n(57)\n\n(58)\n\n9\u00ca+5D\n\nAll the previous considerations apply in this case with n = 3. The vector field can be\neasily determined.\nHence, in all above cases , we find that the symmetry gets enhanced at particular\neigenvalues.\nWe expect that similar analysis can be performed by including the higher negative\npowers of x , such as,\n\u03b2(x) =\n\nX\n\ngn x\u2212n ,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(59)\n\nn\n\nas a solution of (46).\nIn the absence of any potential, equation (35) reduces to\nu\u2032\u2032 + u = 0\n\n(60)\n\nwhere we have scaled u so that \u00ca becomes equal to unity. For comparison, the vector\nfield in this case is\n\u2202\nX = [a1 u sin (x + a2 ) + a7 (sin 2x + a8 ) + a6 ]\n\u2202x\nh\ni \u2202\n. (61)\n+ a1 u2 cos (x + a2 ) + u{a7 sin (2x + a8 ) + a5 } + a3 sin (x + a4 )\n\u2202u\nHowever, the algebra we obtain, (49) , looks more interesting.\n\n\fGroup analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n9\n\nIt is also observed that for a harmonic oscillator potential, the equation\ncorresponding to Eq.(35) does not admit the term containing \u03b2 in the vector field .\nFor the harmonic oscillator,\nu\u2032\u2032 = \u03c9(x, u, u\u2032)\n\n(62)\n\n\u02c6\n\u03c9(x, u, u\u2032) = (x2 + E)u(x)\n\n(63)\n\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) \u2212 2(x2 + \u00ca\u03b2 \u2032 \u2212 2x\u03b2) = 0\n\n(64)\n\nwith\nwhere E\u02c6 is proportional to the energy eigenvalue. Using the same notation as in Eq.(38)\nwith the obvious changes, we arrive at the differential equation for \u03b2 as\n\nwhich do not have solutions like (47). \u03b1 obeys the same equation as u does and the\nvector field is\nh\ni \u2202\n\u2202\n+ u2 \u03b1\u2032 (x) + \u03b4(x)\n.\n(65)\nX = u\u03b1(x)\n\u2202x\n\u2202u\nwith\nx2\n\nu \u221d e\u2212 2 Hn (x)\n\n(66)\n\nwhere Hn is the Hermite polynomial . \u03b1 and \u03b4 are constant multiples of u .\n4. Conclusion\nIn the present case, a simple group theoretic calculation gives the eigenvalues for the\nquantum mechanical problem. We also obtain a class of potentials which give rise to\nsimilar eigenvalues. In some sense, this is analogous to the B\u00e1cklund transform for\ncontinuum states.\nFurther, the group analysis of the differential equation shows how the symmetries\nare enhanced at certain values of energy and correspondingly terms get added to the\nvector field characterising the symmetry. For the lowest values of n we also obtain\nvector fields that do not close under Lie product. The structure of the extended vector\nfield appear similar to that of the algebras of Kac - Moody - Virasoro type [10] which\narise in the case of integrable models. In the context of some solvable models, and\nsupersymmetric theories in the presence of magnetic fields, this type of analysis has\nresulted in Dolan-Grady and related algebras[11, 12]. So it would be interesting to look\nfor the unifying feature of all these algebras.\nSymmetry generators and the breaking of particular ones play crucial role in phase\ntransitions and setting up of models in particle physics. Though the above analysis is\nnot for spontaneous symmetry breaking, but for the symmetries of the solutions, it is\nexpected that this analysis and also the considerations of the symmetry breaking in going\nfrom linear to nonlinear systems [13] would be helpful in having a better understanding\nof spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n\n\fGroup analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n10\n\nReferences\n[1] Fl\u00fcgge S 1994 Practical Quantum Mechanics ( Berlin: Springer Verlag )\n[2] Maharana K 2003 math-ph/0306069\n[3] Olver P J 1993 Application of groups to differential equations ( Berlin:Springer)\nOvsiannikov L V 1982 Group analysis of differential equations (Academic: New York)\nIbragimov N H 1994 (ed.)
