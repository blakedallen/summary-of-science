The\nnotion of quantumness witness is introduced, in analogy to entanglement witness, and illustrated by examples\nof a single qubit and many-body systems with additive observables. We compare also our proposal with the\nquantumness test based on quantum correlations (entanglement) and Bell inequalities. A class of quantumness\nwitnesses associated to the phase space representation is also discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne \u0010rule of thumb\u0011 of quantum theory is the Bohr Correspondence Principle, which can be formulated as follows:\n\nThe systems consisting of a large number of particles and/or emerging in quantum states characterized\nby large quantum numbers behave classically.\nHowever, the validity of this principle, in particular the range of its application, remains open. It seems that with\nimproved experimental techniques the actual border between quantum and classical worlds has been moved into\nlarger and larger systems [2].\n\nThe most daring challenge to the correspondence principle is the idea of macro-\n\nscopic quantum systems. For example, there exists quite convincing evidence that certain macroscopic systems, like\nJosephson junctions (\"superconducting qubits\")[3], Bose-Einstein condensates [4] or Rydberg atoms [5], preserve\nfundamental quantum properties. On the other hand, these arguments are strongly model-dependent and do not\ncompletely exclude the existence of an approximative classical description [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, model-independent\n\ntests of \"quantumness\" are of great theoretical and practical importance. This question is particularly relevant for\nthe \u001celd of quantum information and quantum computation. A useful quantum computer should be a rather macroscopic machine which nevertheless preserves certain fundamental quantum properties. Moreover, it is believed that\nsome examples of macroscopic quantum systems can provide promising implementations of quantum information\nprocessing.\nIn the present paper we develop the ideas introduced in [1] and tested experimentally for a single-photon polarization in [8]. We discuss tests of quantumness based on certain fundamental properties of classical probability\ntheory which are not valid in quantum theory.\nservables called\n\nquantumness witnesses\n\nMathematically, these tests involve certain speci\u001cc quantum ob-\n\nin analogy to\n\nentanglement witnesses\n\n[9]. We discuss in detail the case of\n\na single qubit and then show how the quantumness disappears for many-body systems when we restrict ourselves\nto additive observables only. We compare our proposal with the quantumness test related to quantum correlations\n(entanglement) and Bell inequalities. We also study quantumness witnesses which appear in the context of phase\nspace representation of a quantum oscillator.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nStates and observables\n\nAssume that our aim is to interpret a given set of experimental data in terms of a mathematical model which involves\n\n\u03c1 can be identi\u001ced with a \u001cxed system's preparation\nA with some apparatus which produces a set of outcomes {a} \u2261 {a1 , a2 , ...}. Repeating\nprocedure \u03c1 and the measurement of A many times we obtain the probability distribution\n\nthe notions of states and observables. Operationally, the state\nprocedure and the observable\nthe given preparation\n\npa = (p1 , p2 , ...)\n\nwhich allows, e.g., to compute all moments of the observable\n\nhAk i\u03c1 =\n\nX\n\npj akj , k = 0, 1, 2, ....\n\n(1)\n\nj\nTherefore, a single apparatus corresponds not to a single observable but rather to the whole family of functions\n\nF (A)\n\nof\n\n2.1\n\nA\n\nwhich di\u001ber by a choice of a \"pointer scale\" only.\n\nC \u2217 -algebraic\n\nmodel\n\nWe now need a mathematical model of states and observables. For simplicity we denote by the same symbols the\nphysical states and observables and their mathematical representations. Practically, we shall test only two types\nof models, classical and quantum.\n\nmodel.\n\nBoth can be uni\u001ced within the mathematical scheme called the\n\nC \u2217 -algebraic\n\nHowever, for all practical purposes one can always think about the two simplest extreme cases - the classical\n\nC(\u0393) on a \"discrete phase-space\" \u0393 = {1, 2, ..., n} and the quantum algebra Mn of\nn \u00d7 n complex matrices. A C \u2217 -algebra A is a complete complex linear space with a norm k * k, adjoint operation\nA \u2192 A\u2020 and the product AB satisfying natural relations including the condition kAA\u2020 k = kAk2 . We always assume\nthat A contains a unit element I . The main di\u001berence between the algebra of functions and the algebra of matrices\nis that the former is commutative (i.e. AB=BA) while the latter is not. Linear and bounded functionals on A\n\u2020\nform a linear and normed space. The linear functional \u03c9 is positive if \u03c9(AA ) \u2265 0 for all A \u2208 A and normalized if\n\u2020\n\u03c9(I) = 1. The elements of the form AA are called positive and can be used to de\u001cne a partial order relation in\nC \u2217 -algebra A\nA \u2264 B if and only if there exists C such that B = A + CC \u2020 .\n(2)\n\nalgebra of complex functions\n\nC \u2217 -algebraic model we identify all bounded observables with self-adjoint (i.e. A = A\u2020 ) elements\nthe k-moment of the observable A as de\u001cned by (1) is identi\u001ced with the algebraic k-power of\nthe corresponding element of the C \u2217 -algebra A. The set of all states is identi\u001ced with the set of all positive linear\n\u2217\nfunctionals on C -algebra A . This is a convex set and its extremal points are identi\u001ced with pure states. For the\nWithin the\n\nin such a way that\n\ngiven two examples we obtain the standard pictures. In the classical theory (positive) observables are (positive)\n\nP = (p(1), p(2), .., p(n))\np(j) = \u03b4jk . The possible\noutcomes of the measurement of A are given\nP\nk\nk\nby the numbers {A(\u03b3)} and for the moments we have hA iP =\nthe quantum theory (positive)\n\u03b3 p(\u03b3)A(\u03b3) . In\nP\nP\n2\nobservables are (positive) hermitian matrices with spectral representations A =\nj aj Pj , Pj = Pj ,\nj Pj = I ,\nP\n0\n0\nand the states are identi\u001ced with density matrices \u03c1 =\nm \u03c1m |mihm|, hm |mi = \u03b4m m . Extreme points (pure\nn\nstates) are one-dimensional projections |\u03c8ih\u03c8| identi\u001ced with the normalised vectors in the Hilbert space C .\nThe possible outcomes of the measurement of A are given by its eigenvalues {aj } and for the moments we have\nP\nhAk i\u03c1 = Tr(\u03c1Ak ) = jm \u03c1m (aj )k hm|Pj |mi.\nreal functions\n\nA(\u03b3), \u03b3 = 1, 2, ..n\n\nand the states form a simplex of probability distributions\n\nwith extreme points (pure states) of the form\n\n2.2\n\nThe main theorem\n\nFor a concrete physical system it is very easy to \u001cnd the di\u001berences between the predictions of the classical and\n\nour aim is to \u001cnd the quantumness tests which are model-independent but still operational\nand refer to the most fundamental mathematical di\u001berences between classical and quantum theory. Assuming that\nquantum model. However,\n\nwe always work in the framework of\nsome basic results in the theory of\nTheorem 1.\n\nC \u2217 -algebraic scheme we can use the following general theorem which summarizes\nC \u2217 -algebras [10, 11].\n\nThe following statements are equivalent:\n\n(a) For any pair A, B \u2208 A , 0 \u2264 A \u2264 B implies A2 \u2264 B 2 ;\n(b) For any pair X, Y \u2208 A , X \u2265 0, Y \u2265 0 implies XY + Y X \u2265 0;\n(c) C \u2217 -algebra A is commutative;\n2\n\n\f(d) C \u2217 -algebra A is isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions on a certain compact set.\nProof.\n\nThe equivalence of (c) and (d) is an important result proved, for example, in [10, 11]. The equivalence of\n\n(a) and (c) has been proved in [12]. For practical purposes, in order to prove the equivalence of (a) and (c) we can\nuse as a proof the qubit example from Section 3 because all physically relevant quantum\n\nM2 .\ntake A = X\n\nC \u2217 -algebras\n\ncontain a two\n\ndimensional matrix algebra\nIn order to prove a)\u21d2 b),\n\nand\n\nB = X + tY .\n\nThen\n\n0 \u2264 B 2 \u2212 A2 = t(tY 2 + XY + Y X) for any t \u2265 0\nwhich implies\n\n(3)\n\nXY + Y X \u2265 0.\n\nIn order to prove (b)\u21d2(a) use the inequality\n\n0\u2264A\u2264B\n\nfor\n\n2(B 2 \u2212 A2 ) = (B \u2212 A)(B + A) + (B + A)(B \u2212 A) .\n\n(4)\n\nRemarks In the following, Theorem 1 will be used to design the \"quantumness tests\" which can exclude classical\n\nalgebraic models for given sets of experimental data. In the condition a), instead of the square function one can\nuse any\n\n2.3\n\noperator non-monotone function 1 , for example A \u2192 A\u03b1 , \u03b1 > 1.\n\nHidden variable models\n\nAlthough our aim is not to challenge the quantum mechanical model of Nature but rather to discuss the means\nof distinguishing quantum systems operating in a semiclassical regime from those which still preserve some experimentally accessible and practically useful quantum features, a brief discussion of the relations between our notion\nof a\n\nClassical Algebraic Model\n\nHidden Variable Model\n\n(CAM) and the notion of a\n\n(HVM) seems to be unavoidable.\n\nThere exist di\u001berent de\u001cnitions of HVMs which are probably not equivalent from the mathematical point of view\n(see the monograph [13] and references therein). Their common feature is the existence of a set of parameters\n\nhidden variables )\n\n(\n\ncan be realised assuming that the experiments\nthe hidden variables\nhidden variable\n\n\u03bb\n\n{\u03bb}\n\nwhich determine all possible outcomes of experiments performed on a given system. This idea\n\na(\u03bb), b(\u03bb), c(\u03bb), ....\n\nA, B, C, ..\n\nproduce outcomes\n\n{a}, {b}, {c}, ...\n\nwhich are functions of\n\nThe perfect system's preparation procedure can be described by \u001cxing the\n\nwhich in principle may depend not only on the preparation device but also on the\n\ncontext,\n\ni.e.\n\nthe set of observables to be measured. As we would like to model nondeterministic theories we assume that the\npreparation procedure is not perfect but rather given by the probability distribution on the set of hidden variables\nwhich may still depend on the context and is denoted by\nthe correlations of\n\nA, B\n\nP (\u03bb; A, B, C, ...).\n\nThe mean value of the observable\n\nZ\nhAiP =\n\nZ\nP (\u03bb; A, B, C, ...)a(\u03bb) d\u03bb , hABiP =\n\nP (\u03bb; A, B, C, ...)a(\u03bb)b(\u03bb) d\u03bb .\n\nIt seems that the presented scheme covers most of the known examples of HVMs, including the so-called\nand/or\n\ncontextual\n\nA and\n\nare given by the following expressions\n\n(5)\n\nnonlocal\n\nones. The CAM considered in this paper can be treated as a special case of the HVM of above\n\nwith the additional assumption that the state preparation procedure and the di\u001berent measurement procedures are\nindependent of each other which implies the following\n\nindependence condition\n\n[14]\n\nP (\u03bb; A, B, C, ...) \u2261 P (\u03bb) .\nThe condition (6) is often attributed to\n\nlocality\n\n(6)\n\nin the sense of special relativity theory. On the other hand, it is\n\nrather related to the possibility of decomposing the Universe into weakly interacting subsystems which correspond,\nfor example, to a given physical system, preparing apparatus and measurement devices.\n\n3\n\nQuantumness witnesses\n\nFrom Theorem 1 it follows that for a\n\n{A, B; 0 \u2264 A \u2264 B}\n\nor\n\nQuantum Algebraic Model\n\n{X, Y ; X \u2265 0, Y \u2265 0}\n\n(QAM) we can always \u001cnd pairs of observables\n\nsuch that the operators\n\nV = B 2 \u2212 A2\n\nand\n\nsess negative eigenvalues. Analogically to the theory of entanglement [15] we can call such\n\nC = XY + Y X posV and C quantumness\n\n1 A function f : R \u2192 R is operator monotone if for all n and all A, B \u2208 M we have that A \u2264 B implies f (A) \u2264 f (B).\nn\n\n3\n\n\fwitnesses (QW). We remind the reader that an entanglement witness\n\nis an observable which possesses at least one\n\nnegative eigenvalue but for all separable states yields positive mean values. The main problem is to design experimental tests of the \"violation of classicality\", i.e., an experimental proof of the existence of negative outcomes for\nand\n\nC.\n\nWithin the algebraic framework one assumes that for any self-adjoint element of\n\nrealizable observable. In particular, for two observables\n\nX\n\nand\n\nY\n\nthe observables\n\nX \u00b1Y\n\nA\n\nV\n\nthere exists a physically\n\nand\n\nXY + Y X\n\nexist also.\n\nHowever, in general, there is no operational prescription as to how to construct the corresponding apparatus if we\nknow how to do it for\nmoments of\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\nX\n\nand\n\nY.\n\nFortunately, for the quantumness witness\n\nand \u001cnd a state\n\n\u03c1\n\nsuch that\n\nhB 2 i\u03c1 < hA2 i\u03c1 .\n\nFor\n\nC\n\nV\n\nit is enough to measure the second\n\nthe situation is di\u001berent, namely in the\n\ngeneral case there is no operational prescription as to how to measure the (symmetrized) correlations\n\nhXY + Y Xi\u03c1 .\n\nThe exception is the case of jointly measurable (i.e. commuting) observables where we simply take as outcomes for\n\nXY = Y X\n\nthe products of the outcomes for\n\nX and Y . Another situation is discussed in Section 5, in the context\nC is related to the mean value of the Bell observable, whose mean\n\nof Bell inequalities, where the mean value of\n\nvalue can be computed from the experimental data.\n\n3.1\n\nThe abundance of quantumness witnesses\n\nTheorem 1 ensures only the existence of a QW for the quantum algebraic model. The following Theorem 2 shows\ntheir abundance.\n\nFor any n \u00d7 n density matrix \u03c1 6= 11/n there exist quantumness witnesses of the type V = B 2 \u2212 A2\nand C = XY + Y X . For the maximally mixed state such witnesses do not exist.\nTheorem 2.\n\nProof.\n\nWe \u001crst prove the case\n\nn = 2.\n\nThe density matrix can be written as\n\n\u03c1 = (1 \u2212 r)\nwith\n\n11\n\n2\n\n+ r |\u03c8i h\u03c8| ,\n\n(7)\n\nr \u2265 0 and r = 0 for the maximally mixed state. We look for two observables of the form X = |ai ha| , Y = |di hd|,\n|ai , |di. We consider the expansion\n\nfor some normalized vectors\n\n|di = \u03b1 |ai + \u03b2 |a\u22a5 i ,\n\nha|a\u22a5 i = 0,\n\n|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1.\n\nThus,\n\nXY + Y X \u2261 {X, Y } = 2|\u03b1|2 |ai ha| + \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 |ai ha\u22a5 | + \u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 |a\u22a5 i ha| .\n{X, Y } are \u03bb\u00b1 = |\u03b1|(|\u03b1| \u00b1 1),\n{X, Y } corresponding to \u03bb\u2212 .\n\nThe eigenvalues of\nthe eigenvector of\n\nand we can always choose\n\n|ai\n\nand\n\n|di\n\nso that\n\n|\u03c8i\n\ncoincides with\n\nTherefore we have that for such choices\n\nTr(\u03c1{X, Y }) =\n\n1\u2212r\nTr{X, Y } + rh\u03c8, {X, Y }\u03c8i = (1 \u2212 r)|\u03b1|2 + r|\u03b1|(|\u03b1| \u2212 1) = |\u03b1|(|\u03b1| \u2212 r),\n2\n\nwhich becomes strictly negative for\n\n0 < |\u03b1| < r.\nC = {X, Y }. To obtain the QW V = B 2 \u2212 A2 we follow the arguments in the proof of the\nTheorem 1 with A = X and B = X + tY . It is worth noticing that for the choice A = |ai ha| , B = |ai ha| + t |di hd|,\n2\n2\none sees immediately that B \u2212 A \u0003 0 for all t > 0, if |\u03b1| =\n6 1.\n11\nIn order to generalize the result to an arbitrary n one should notice that the condition \u03c1 6=\nn means that\nthere are always two eigenvalues of \u03c1 , say \u03c11 , \u03c12 satisfying \u03c11 > \u03c12 \u2265 0 with corresponding eigenvectors |1i, |2i.\nTherefore, we can repeat the proof of above with operators X, Y having the supports on the two dimensional\nsubspace spanned by |1i, |2i. The second statement of the Theorem follows from the fact that Tr(XY ) \u2265 0 if both\nX \u2265 0 and Y \u2265 0.\nand provides the QW\n\n4\n\nTest of quantumness for a single system\n\nAccording to the discussion in the previous section, we choose the\n\nC \u2217 -algebraic\n\nmodel as a proper mathematical\n\nidealization. Our aim is to propose tests which can eliminate the CAM as a valid description of the experimental\ndata.\n\nWe assume that the experimental situation can be described in terms of the set\n\n4\n\nSexp\n\nof accessible initial\n\n\fstates of a certain physical system and the set of accessible measurements (observables)\n\nA \u2208 Aexp\n\nand any state\n\n\u03c1 \u2208 Sexp\n\nstatistics of the measurement outcomes.

Therefore, one is led to conclude that\nthe corresponding physical system preserves some genuine quantum features, as any minimal model would have to\nbe quantum according to Theorem 1. However, one could still argue that there may exist a \"non-minimal\" classical\nmodel, with the observable\n\nB \u2212 A possessing negative outcomes which are averaged out by too coarse-grained initial\n\nstates (probability distributions). The possibility of this alternative might be called the\n\nminimality loophole.\n\nIn\n\nany case, notice that this latter possibility would mean that the resolution on the side of observables is (much)\nhigher than the corresponding resolution on the side of initial states, and this does not seem a reasonable condition.\nIndeed, in practice we typically use the same techniques for both the state preparation and the measurements.\nTherefore, within the given technological means, both resolutions should be of the same order.\n\n[0, 3]\n\nExample 2 Given the interval\n\non the real line, consider the functions\n\n(\nA(x) =\nFurther, consider the algebra\n\nA\n\n3\n2\n\n(\n\nx \u2208 [0, 2]\n,\nx \u2208 ]2, 3]\n\n0\n\nB(x) =\n\n3 x \u2208 [0, 1]\n.\n1 x \u2208]1, 3]\n\nof all real functions with support on the interval\n\nf (x) =\n\n3\nX\n\n(8)\n\n[0, 3]\n\nand of the form\n\nfi \u03c7i (x),\n\ni=1\nwith\n\n\u03c7i\n\nthe indicator function\n\n(\n\u03c7i (x) =\n\n1 x \u2208 [i \u2212 1, i]\n,\n0 elsewhere\n\nf in A is identi\u001ced with a vector (fi )i \u2261 (f1 , f2 , f3 ). The algebraic structure is given by the\n\u03b1(fi )i \u2261 (\u03b1fi )i , (fi )i + (gi )i \u2261 (fi + gi )i , and (fi )i \u00d7 (gi )i \u2261 (fi gi )i . It is immediately seen that A is\nspanned by A and B under the same set of operations. States for this algebra may be taken to be all probability\nR3\ndensity distributions p(x) \u2265 0,\np(x)dx = 1. The expectation value for an observable f with respect to a state p\n0\nR3\nR3\nP\nis then given by hf ip =\nf\n(x)p(x)dx\n= i pi fi , with pi \u2261 0 \u03c7i p(x)dx. It is clear that: (i) two algebra elements\n0\n(observables) f and g are ordered as f \u2265 g , i.e., hf ip \u2265 hgip for all p, if and only if fi \u2265 gi for all i = 1, 2, 3. Thus,\n\nso that each function\noperations\n\nthree experimentally accessible \u0010peaked enough\u0011 states such as\n\n(\npi (x) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2 x \u2208 i \u2212 1 + 41 , i \u2212 14\n,\n0 elsewhere\n\nare su\u001ecient to determine whether any two observables in the algebra\nsaid states one \u001cnds that the two observables\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\nA\n\nare ordered. In particular, by checking\n\nare actually not ordered, therefore they cannot be used to\n\ntest any quantumness in the sense of Theorem 1.\nExample 3 Consider the same setting as in Example 2, in particular the same observable functions\n\nHowever, let us consider more coarse grained experimentally accessible states (see Figure 2)\n\n(\nq1 (x) =\n\n1\n2\n\nx \u2208 [0, 2]\n\n0\n\nelsewhere\n\n(\n,\n\nq2 (x) =\n\n5\n\n1\n2\n\nx \u2208 [1, 3]\n\n0\n\nelsewhere\n\n.\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB.\n\n\fFigure 1: The absence of ordering between the observables\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\nis revealed by set of experimentally accessible\n\nstates.

While one could be led to\nconclude that the interpretation of the experiment requires a quantum model, it is clear that the model is classical\nby construction. In any case, said classical model is non-minimal, i.e. ordering on the experimental states does not\nlead to ordering for the full model. This is due to the fact that the experimentally accessible states do not have a\nhigh enough \u0010resolution\u0011.\n\n4.1\n\nA single qubit\n\nAs an example we would like to \u001cnd the optimal quantumness witness\n\nV = B 2 \u2212A2\n\nfor a qubit which has a maximal\n\nmagnitude of its negative eigenvalue under a certain normalization condition.

For example, for many-body systems we usually restrict ourselves to collective, global, observables\n\nB\n\nof the form\n\nA=\n\nN\nN\n1 X\n1 X\nai , B =\nbi\nN i=1\nN i=1\n\nA and\n(27)\n\nai and bi are copies of the single particle observables a , b and N is the number of particles. Assume that\n0 \u2264 a \u2264 b and the single particle quantumnes witness v = b2 \u2212 a2 has minimal negative eigenvalue \u2212\u03bc. With these\ncollective observables, it is interesting to study their behavior as N becomes large. Intuitively one can expect that\nwhere\n\n8\n\n\fas N increases, so any detectable quantum behavior should diminish. This can be\nV = B 2 \u2212 A2 which is rewritten in terms of \"diagonal\" and \"o\u001b-diagonal\" terms as\n\nV =\n\nseen for the collective witness\n\nN\nN\nN\n1 X 2\n1 X X\n2\n(b\n\u2212\na\n)\n+\n(bi bj \u2212 ai aj ).\ni\nN 2 i=1 i\nN 2 i=1\n\n(28)\n\nj=1,i6=j\n\nThe \u001crst sum is simply the sum of the individual witnesses,\ncan be rewritten as\n\nvi ,\n\nand the second term is positive. This second sum\n\nN\nN\nN\nN\n1 X X\n1 X X\n(b\nb\n\u2212\na\na\n)\n=\n(bi + ai )(bj \u2212 aj ),\ni\nj\ni\nj\nN 2 i=1\nN 2 i=1\nj=1,i6=j\n\n(29)\n\nj=1,i6=j\n\nai bj \u2212 bi aj disappear under the sum. Since we have the condition bi \u2265 ai \u2265 0, and since the\naj , bj act on di\u001berent spaces for i 6= j , it can be seen that this sum is positive. Therefore, the\nmagnitude of the lowest negative eigenvalue of V is bounded from above by \u03bc/N and quantum behaviour becomes\nundetectable for collective observables and large N .\nwhere the terms\n\noperators\n\nai , bi\n\nand\n\nThis should have consequences for the discussion of the quantumness of superconducting qubits and BEC. Namely,\nfor both cases the accessible observables are particle numbers or electric charge in a macroscopic region, macroscopic\ncurrent, etc., which are all of the collective type (27) with the typical values of\n\n5\n\nN = 105\n\nto\n\n109 .\n\nBell inequalities and quantumness witness\n\nBell inequalities, in various formulations, characterize correlations between measurement outcomes which admit the\nso-called Local Hidden Variable Model (LHVM). Here, according to the discussion in Section 2.3 we replace the\nLHVM by a CAM. For simplicity we consider only the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt version (CHSH inequality)\nwhere the observables\n\nA1 , A2\n\nare measured on the one subsystem and the observables\n\nassume that all observables are dichotomic, i.e. their outcomes are equal to\nmodel all observables are treated as classical functions\n\nAi (\u03bb), Bj (\u03bb)\n\n\u00b11.\n\nB1 , B2\n\non the other one. We\n\nAs discussed in Section 2.3, in this\n\non a common space\n\n\u039b\n\nand take the values\n\n\u00b11\n\nonly. Then the observables\n\nX = 2 \u00b1 (A1 B1 + A1 B2 ) , Y = 2 \u00b1 (A2 B1 \u2212 A2 B2 ).\nare positive and hence\n\nXY \u2265 0\n\nas well. Therefore, for any probability distribution\n\n0\u2264\n\n(30)\n\nP (\u03bb)\n\nwe obtain the inequality\n\n1\nhXY iP = 2 \u00b1 h(A1 B1 + A1 B2 + A2 B1 \u2212 A2 B2 iP ,\n2\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is equivalent to the standard form of CHSH inequality\n\n|h(A1 B1 + A1 B2 + A2 B1 \u2212 A2 B2 )iP | \u2264 2 .\n\n(32)\n\nThe experimentally observed violations of the inequality (32) means that Nature cannot be described by a CAM.\n\n5.1\n\nTest of quantumness for a bipartite system\n\nThe CHSH inequality (32) can also be used to test whether a quantum device does not operate in the semiclassical\nregime. It seems to be even more reliable than the single-system test discussed in Section 4. Namely, we now do not\nhave the\n\nminimality loophole\n\nproblem because any violation of (32) means that the description in terms of CAM is\n\nnot valid.\nHowever, to perform the test of (32) we need, \u001crstly, to control precisely the system composed of two subsystems\nwhich is usually much more di\u001ecult than in the case of a single system. Secondly, we have to perform simultaneously\ntwo independent measurements on both subsystems.\n\nEven if the system is essentially classical it is often very\n\ndi\u001ecult to satisfy the independence condition (6) which leads to the so-called\n\nlocality loophole.\n\nTherefore, for many\n\nimplementations of quantum devices relevant for quantum information processing the single-system test might be\nmuch easier to perform than the bipartite one.\n\n9\n\n\f5.2\n\nBell observables and quantumness witness\n\nBearing in mind the de\u001cnitions (30), the relation to quantumness witnesses is rather obvious. Consider now the\n\nA1 , A2 , B1 , B2 . Replacing the product of functions by a\n1\n{A\n,\nB\n}\nwe obtain the positive observables X and Y for a general quantum\ni\nj\n2\nquantumness witness. However, neither the observable C nor its mean value is\n\ngeneral case of four dichotomic quantum observables\n\nAi \u25e6 Bj =\nC = XY + Y X is a\n\nsymmetrized product\nmodel, and\n\noperationally well-de\u001cned. Let us assume that\nthe mean value of the following\n\n{Ai }\n\nand\n\n{Bj }\n\ncorrespond to di\u001berent subsystems,\n\n[Ai , Bj ] = 0\n\nand\n\nBell observable B (compare with [17]) has an operational meaning as a combination\n\nof measurable correlations\n\nB = 2 \u00b1 (A1 B1 + A1 B2 + A2 B1 \u2212 A2 B2 ) .\nIn this case the Bell observable is related to the quantumness witness\n\nC\n\n(33)\n\nby the expression\n\n2B = C + [A1 , A2 ][B1 , B2 ] ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhich provides an interesting relation between Bell inequality, QW and the Heisenberg uncertainty relations (compare with [18] for Bell inequalities vs entanglement witnesses).\n\n6\n\nGeneralizations of QW\n\nThe presented examples of quantumness witnesses suggest a certain generalization of this idea. Take two observables\ndescribed by self-adjoint operators\n\nW = W (R; S)\n\nR\n\nand\n\nS\n\nwith the spectra\n\nSpec(R)\n\nand\n\nSpec(S)\n\nrespectively.\n\nR, S is a QW if it possesses\nw(r; s) obtained by the replacement of operators by real numbers,\nR \u2192 r , S \u2192 s in W (R; S) is positive, i.e. w(r; s) \u2265 0 for all r \u2208 Spec(R) and s \u2208 Spec(S).\n2\n2\nThe previously introduced QW of the form V = B \u2212A satis\u001ces this de\u001cnition taking R \u2261 A and B \u2261 R+S with\n2\nR \u2265 0 and S \u2265 0. Indeed, V \u2261 W (R; S) = R + RS + SR possesses a negative eigenvalue and w(r; s) = r2 + 2rs \u2265 0\nfor r, s \u2265 0. The same holds for QW of the type C = XY + Y X with the identi\u001ccation X = R \u2265 0, Y = S \u2265 0.\nAn observable\n\nwritten as an (ordered) polynomial or power series of\n\nat least one negative eigenvalue and the function\n\nAnother class of quantumness witnesses is related to phase-representations of Quantum Mechanics in terms of\ncoherent states and the so-called\npair of observables\n\nQ, P ,\n\nP-representation [19, 20].\n\nthe annihilation operator\n\na=\n\nConsider a single quantum oscillator with the canonical\n\u221a1 (Q \u2212 iP ) satisfying\n2\n\n[Q, P ] = i , [a, a\u2020 ] = 1\n\n(35)\n\n1\na|zi = z|zi, z = \u221a (q \u2212 ip) , q, p \u2208 R\n2\n\n(36)\n\nand the family of coherent vectors\n\nwith the normalisation and completeness conditions\n\nZ\n\nd2 |zihz| = I .\n\nhz|zi = 1 ,\nAny density matrix\n\n\u03c1\n\n(37)\n\ncan be represented by a function (distribution) on the phase-space denoted by\n\n\u03c1\u0303(z)\n\nand such\n\nthat (P-representation)\n\nZ\nThe\n\ndequantisation\n\nfunction\n\n\u03c1\u0303(z)\n\nmap for the states\n\nd2 z \u03c1\u0303(z)|zihz| = \u03c1 .\n\n\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1\u0303(z) \u2261 \u03c1\u0303(q; p)\n\n(38)\n\nis linear but does not preserve positivity.

The main feature of a QW is that for any state which is considered in a given context\nas \"classical\" its mean value is positive but nevertheless its spectrum contains at least one negative eigenvalue. The\nnotion of classicality is understood here in a very practical and \"contextual\" sense. Namely, we assume that we\nhave at our disposal a restricted set of experimental data which we want to interpret in terms of sets of accessible\nstates and observables within a classical or quantum model. A properly chosen QW can provide an experimental\ntest which detects among the accessible states those which cannot be described by a classical model. The necessary\ncondition is the possibility of computing the average of the QW using experimental data. A natural application\nof this idea is the implementation of quantum information processing. Devices designed for quantum information\nprocessing must work in the quantum regime and therefore violation of classicality described in terms of QWs could\nbe the \u001crst experimental test of their usefulness.\n\nAcknowledgements.\n\nThe authors thank M.
