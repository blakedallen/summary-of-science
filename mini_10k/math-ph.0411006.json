General asymptotic formulae describing deformations of\na conical surface for different kinds of perturbing matrices are derived. As a\nphysical application, singularities of the surfaces of refractive indices in crystal\noptics are studied.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the papers by [Von Neumann and Wigner (1929)] and [Teller (1937)] it is known\nthat the energy surfaces in quantum physics may cross forming two sheets of a double\ncone: a diabolo. The apex of the cone is called a diabolic point, see [Berry and Wilkinson (1984)].\nThis kind of crossing is typical for systems described by real symmetric Hamiltonians with at least two parameters and Hermitian Hamiltonians depending on three\nor more parameters. From mathematical point of view the energy surfaces are described by eigenvalues of real symmetric or Hermitian operators dependent on parameters, and the diabolic point is a point of a double eigenvalue with two linearly\nindependent eigenvectors. In modern problems of quantum physics, crystal optics,\n1\n\n\fphysical chemistry, acoustics and mechanics it is important to know how the diabolic\npoint bifurcates under arbitrary complex perturbations forming topological singularities of eigenvalue surfaces like a double coffee filter with two exceptional points or\na diabolic circle of exceptional points, see e.g. [Mondragon and Hernandez (1993)],\n[Mondragon and Hernandez (1996)], [Shuvalov and Scott (2000)], [Keck et al. (2003)],\n[Berry and Dennis (2003)], [Korsch and Mossman (2003)], [Berry (2004)].\nIn our preceding companion paper [Mailybaev et al. (2004)], a general theory of\ncoupling of eigenvalues for complex matrices of arbitrary dimension smoothly depending on multiple real parameters was presented. Two kinds of important singularities\nwere mathematically classified: the diabolic points (DPs) and the exceptional points\n(EPs). DP is a point where the eigenvalues coalesce, while corresponding eigenvectors remain different (linearly independent), and EP is a point where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce forming a Jordan block. General formulae describing coupling and decoupling of eigenvalues, crossing and avoided crossing of eigenvalue surfaces were derived. Both the DP and EP cases are interesting in applications and were observed in experiments, see [Ramachandran and Ramaseshan (1961)],\n[Dembowsky et al. (2001)], [Dembowsky et al. (2003)], [Stehmann et al. (2004)].\nIn the present paper following the theory developed in [Mailybaev et al. (2004)]\nwe study effects of complex perturbations in multiparameter families of real symmetric and Hermitian matrices. In case of real symmetric matrices we study unfolding\nof eigenvalue surfaces near a diabolic point under real and complex perturbations.\nOrigination of singularities like a \"double coffee filter\" and a \"diabolic circle\" is analytically described. Unfolding of a diabolic point of a Hermitian matrix under an\narbitrary complex perturbation is analytically treated. We emphasize that the unfolding of eigenvalue surfaces is described qualitatively as well as quantitatively by\nusing only the information at the diabolic point, including eigenvalues, eigenvectors,\nand derivatives of the system matrix taken at the diabolic point.\nAs a physical application, singularities of the surfaces of refractive indices in crystal\noptics are studied. Asymptotic formulae for the metamorphoses of these surfaces\ndepending on properties of a crystal are established and discussed in detail. Singular\naxes for general crystals with weak absorption and chirality are found. A new explicit\ncondition distinguishing the absorbtion-dominated and chirality-dominated crystals\nis established in terms of components of the inverse dielectric tensor.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAsymptotic expressions for eigenvalues near a\ndiabolic point\n\nLet us consider the eigenvalue problem\nAu = \u03bbu\n\n(1)\n\nfor an m \u00d7 m Hermitian matrix A, where \u03bb is an eigenvalue and u is an eigenvec-\n\ntor. Such eigenvalue problems arise in non-dissipative physics with and without time\nreversal symmetry. Real symmetric and complex Hermitian matrices correspond to\nthese two cases, respectively. We assume that the matrix A smoothly depends on a\nvector of n real parameters p = (p1 , . . . , pn ). Let \u03bb0 be a double eigenvalue of the matrix A0 = A(p0 ) for some vector p0 . Since A0 is a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalue\n\u03bb0 is real and possesses two eigenvectors u1 and u2 . Thus, the point of eigenvalue\ncoupling for Hermitian matrices is diabolic. We choose the eigenvectors satisfying the\nnormalization conditions\n(u1 , u1 ) = (u2 , u2 ) = 1,\n\n(u1 , u2 ) = 0,\n\nwhere the standard inner product of complex vectors is given by (u, v) =\n\n(2)\nPm\n\ni=1\n\nui v i .\n\nUnder perturbation of parameters p = p0 + \u2206p, the bifurcation of \u03bb0 into two\nsimple eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 occurs. The asymptotic formula for \u03bb\u00b1 under multiparameter perturbation is [Mailybaev et al. (2004)]\nhf11 + f22 , \u2206pi\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb0 +\n\u00b1\n2\n\ns\n\nhf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi2\n+ hf12 , \u2206pihf21 , \u2206pi.\n4\n\n(3)\n\nComponents of the vector fij = (fij1 , . . . , fijn ) are\nfijk\n\n=\n\n!\n\n\u2202A\nui , uj ,\n\u2202pk\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the derivative is taken at p0 , and inner products of vectors in (3) are given by\nha, bi =\n\nPn\n\ni=1\n\nai bi . In expression (3) the higher order terms o(k\u2206pk) and o(k\u2206pk2 )\n\nare neglected before and under the square root. Since the matrix A is Hermitian,\nthe vectors f11 and f22 are real and the vectors f12 = f 21 are complex conjugate. In\ncase of real symmetric matrices A = AT , the vectors f11 , f22 , and f12 = f21 are real.\n3\n\n\fThe asymptotic expression for the eigenvectors corresponding to \u03bb\u00b1 takes the form\n[Mailybaev et al. (2004)]\nu\u00b1 = \u03b1\u00b1 u1 + \u03b2\u00b1 u2 ,\n\nhf12 , \u2206pi\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212 hf22 , \u2206pi\n\u03b1\u00b1\n=\n=\n.\n\u03b2\u00b1\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212 hf11 , \u2206pi\nhf21 , \u2206pi\n\n(5)\n\nExpressions (5) provide zero order terms for the eigenvectors u\u00b1 under perturbation\nof the parameter vector.\nNow, consider an arbitrary complex perturbation of the matrix family A(p) +\n\u2206A(p). Such perturbations appear due to non-conservative effects breaking symmetry\nof the initial system. We assume that the size of perturbation \u2206A(p) \u223c \u03b5 is small,\n\nwhere \u03b5 = k\u2206A(p0 )k is the Frobenius norm of the perturbation at the diabolic point.\nBehavior of the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 for small \u2206p and small \u03b5 is described by the following\nasymptotic formula [Mailybaev et al. (2004)]\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb0 +\ns\n\nhf11 + f22 , \u2206pi \u03b511 + \u03b522\n+\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\n(hf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi + \u03b511 \u2212 \u03b522\n+ (hf12 , \u2206pi + \u03b512 )(hf21 , \u2206pi + \u03b521 ).\n4\nThe quantities \u03b5ij are small complex numbers of order \u03b5 given by the expression\n\u00b1\n\n)2\n\n\u03b5ij = (\u2206A(p0 )ui , uj ) .\n\n(7)\n\nA small variation of the matrix family leads to the following correction of the asymptotic expression for the eigenvectors\n\u03b5\n\u03b1\u00b1\nhf12 , \u2206pi + \u03b512\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212 hf22 , \u2206pi \u2212 \u03b522\n\u03b5\n=\n=\n.\nu\u00b1 = \u03b1\u00b1\nu1 + \u03b2\u00b1\u03b5 u2 ,\n\u03b5\n\u03b2\u00b1\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212 hf11 , \u2206pi \u2212 \u03b511\nhf21 , \u2206pi + \u03b521\n(8)\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\nThe ratios \u03b1+\n/\u03b2+\u03b5 = \u03b1\u2212\n/\u03b2\u2212\u03b5 at the point of coincident eigenvalues \u03bb+ = \u03bb\u2212 . Hence,\n\nthe eigenvectors u+ = u\u2212 coincide, and the point of eigenvalue coupling of the perturbed system becomes exceptional (EP). For some specific perturbations \u2206A(p), the\ncoupling point may remain diabolic under the conditions\nhf12 , \u2206pi + \u03b512 = 0, hf21 , \u2206pi + \u03b521 = 0, hf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi + \u03b511 \u2212 \u03b522 = 0,\n\n(9)\n\nwhen both ratios in (8) become undetermined.\nWe observe that asymptotic description of unfolding of diabolic singularity due\nto perturbation of the matrix family requires only the value of \u2206A(p) taken at the\ncoupling point p0 . Dependence of the perturbation \u2206A on the vector of parameters\np near the point p0 is not so important, since it influences higher order terms.\n4\n\n\f3\n\nUnfolding of a diabolic singularity for real symmetric matrices\n\nLet us assume that A(p) is an n-parameter family of real symmetric matrices. Then\nits eigenvalues \u03bb are real. Let \u03bb0 be a double eigenvalue of the matrix A0 = A(p0 ) with\ntwo real eigenvectors u1 and u2 . Under perturbation of parameters p = p0 + \u2206p, the\neigenvalue \u03bb0 splits into two simple eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 . The asymptotic formula\nfor \u03bb\u00b1 under multiparameter perturbation is given by equations (3) and (4), where\nthe vectors f11 , f22 , and f12 = f21 are real. Then, equation (3) takes the form\nhf11 + f22 , \u2206pi\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2212\n2\n\n!2\n\n\u2212\n\nhf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi2\n\u2212 hf12 , \u2206pi2 = 0.\n4\n\n(10)\n\nEquation (10) describes a surface in the space (p1 , p2 , . . . , pn , \u03bb), which consists of\ntwo sheets \u03bb+ (p) and \u03bb\u2212 (p). These sheets are connected at the points satisfying the\nequations\n1\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb0 + hf11 + f22 , \u2206pi, hf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi = 0, hf12 , \u2206pi = 0,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the eigenvalues couple: \u03bb+ = \u03bb\u2212 . Equations (11) define a plane of dimension\nn \u2212 2. Thus, the double eigenvalue is a phenomenon of codimension 2 in an nparameter family of real symmetric matrices [Von Neumann and Wigner (1929)].\n\nFor the two-parameter matrix A(p1 , p2 ) equation (10) defines a double cone with\napex at the point (p0 , \u03bb0 ) in the space (p1 , p2 , \u03bb), see Figure 1. The point (p0 , \u03bb0 )\nis referred to as a \"diabolic point\" [Berry and Wilkinson (1984)] due to the conical\nshape of the children's toy \"diabolo\".\nLet us consider a perturbation A(p) + \u2206A(p) of the real symmetric family A(p)\nin the vicinity of the diabolic point p0 , where \u2206A(p) is a complex matrix with the\nsmall norm \u03b5 = k\u2206A(p0 )k. Splitting of the double eigenvalue \u03bb0 due to a change of\n\nthe vector of parameters \u2206p and a small complex perturbation \u2206A is described by\nequation (6), which acquires the form\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb\u20320 + \u03bc \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\nc, c = (x + \u03be)2 + (y + \u03b7)2 \u2212 \u03b6 2.\n\n(12)\n\nIn equation (12) the quantities \u03bb\u20320 , x, and y are real:\n1\n1\n\u03bb\u20320 = \u03bb0 + hf11 + f22 , \u2206pi, x = hf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi, y = hf12 , \u2206pi,\n2\n2\n5\n\n(13)\n\n\fFigure 1: A diabolic point in a family of real symmetric matrices.\nwhile the small coefficients \u03bc, \u03be, \u03b7, and \u03b6 are complex:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bc = (\u03b511 + \u03b522 ), \u03be = (\u03b511 \u2212 \u03b522 ), \u03b7 = (\u03b512 + \u03b521 ), \u03b6 = (\u03b512 \u2212 \u03b521 ).\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(14)\n\nSeparating real and imaginary parts in equation (12), we find\nRe2 (\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\u20320 \u2212\u03bc) \u2212Im2 (\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\u20320 \u2212\u03bc) = Rec, 2Re(\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\u20320 \u2212\u03bc)Im(\u03bb \u2212\u03bb\u20320 \u2212\u03bc) = Imc, (15)\nwhere\nRec = (Im2 \u03b6\u2212Im2 \u03be\u2212Im2 \u03b7\u2212Re2 \u03b6)+(x+Re\u03be)2+(y+Re\u03b7)2 ,\n\n(16)\n\nImc = 2((x+Re\u03be)Im\u03be + (y+Re\u03b7)Im\u03b7 \u2212 Re\u03b6Im\u03b6).\n\n(17)\n\nFrom equations (15) we get the expressions determining the real and imaginary\nparts of the perturbed eigenvalues\nRe\u03bb\u00b1 =\n\n\u03bb\u20320\n\n+ Re\u03bc \u00b1\n\nIm\u03bb\u00b1 = Im\u03bc \u00b1\n\ns\u0012\n\nRec +\n\ns\u0012\n\n\u2212Rec +\n\nq\n\nRe2 c + Im2 c\n\nq\n\nRe2 c + Im2 c\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n/2,\n\n/2.\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nStrictly speaking, for the same eigenvalue one should take equal or opposite signs\nbefore the square roots in (18), (19) for positive or negative Imc, respectively.\nEquations (18) and (19) define surfaces in the spaces (p1 , p2 , . . . , pn , Re\u03bb) and\n(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn , Im\u03bb).

For D < 0, the equations Rec = 0\nand Imc = 0 have no real solutions. In the latter case, the eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212\nseparate for all \u2206p.\nNote that the quantities Im\u03be and Im\u03b7 are expressed by means of the anti-Hermitian\nT\n\npart \u2206AN = (\u2206A \u2212 \u2206A )/2 of the matrix \u2206A as\n(\u2206AN (p0 )u1 , u1 )\u2212(\u2206AN (p0 )u2 , u2 )\n,\n2i\n(\u2206AN (p0 )u1 , u2 )+(\u2206AN (p0 )u2 , u1 )\nIm\u03b7 =\n,\n2i\nIm\u03be =\n\n(26)\n\nT\n\nwhile Im\u03b6 depends on the Hermitian part \u2206AH = (\u2206A + \u2206A )/2 as\nIm\u03b6 =\n\n(\u2206AH (p0 )u1 , u2 ) \u2212 (\u2206AH (p0 )u2 , u1 )\n.\n2i\n7\n\n(27)\n\n\fFigure 2: Unfolding of a diabolic point due to complex perturbation.\nIf D > 0, one can say that the influence of the anti-Hermitian part of the perturbation\n\u2206A is stronger than that of the Hermitian part. If the Hermitian part prevails in\nthe perturbation \u2206A, we have D < 0. In particular, D = \u2212Im2 \u03b6 < 0 for a purely\n\nHermitian perturbation \u2206A.\n\nLet us assume that the vector p consists of only two components p1 and p2 , and\nconsider the surfaces (18) and (19) for different kinds of the perturbation \u2206A(p).\nConsider first the case D < 0. Then, the eigensheets Re\u03bb+ (p) and Re\u03bb\u2212 (p) are\nseparate, see Figure 2a. Indeed, for D \u2264 \u2212Re2 \u03b6 the inequality Rec \u2265 0 holds for all\n\nvariations of parameters, see equation (16). In the case when \u2212Re2 \u03b6 < D < 0 the\n\nequation Rec = 0 with expressions (13) define an ellipse in the plane of parameters\n\n(p1 , p2 ). Inside the ellipse we have Rec < 0 and outside Rec > 0. Equation Imc = 0\ndefines a line in parameter plane. The line and the ellipse have no common points\nfor D < 0 since there are no real solutions of the equation c = 0. Hence, for D < 0\nconditions (20) are not fulfilled and the real parts of the eigenvalues avoid crossing.\nAs the size of the complex perturbation decreases (\u03b5 \u2192 0), the two sheets come closer\n8\n\n\fand touch each other at the point (p0 , \u03bb0 ) for \u03b5 = 0 forming the diabolic singularity.\nThe sheets Im\u03bb+ (p) and Im\u03bb\u2212 (p) of the eigensurface (19) intersect along the line\nImc/2 = (x+Re\u03be)Im\u03be + (y+Re\u03b7)Im\u03b7 \u2212 Re\u03b6Im\u03b6 = 0, Im\u03bb\u00b1 = Im\u03bc,\n\n(28)\n\ngiven by conditions (21). Note that, by using (22), one can show that the angle of\nintersection of the imaginary eigensheets is small of order \u03b5 and tends to zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nIn the case D > 0 the line Imc = 0 and the ellipse Rec = 0 have common points\n\npa and pb where the eigenvalues couple. Coordinates of these points found from the\nequations (13) are\n!\n\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2f12\nxa,b \u2212(f11\n\u2212f22\n)ya,b\n2f 2 xa,b \u2212(f11\n\u2212f22\n)ya,b\n,\n,\npa,b =p0 + \u2212 1 122\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\nf12 (f11 \u2212f22 )\u2212f12 (f11 \u2212f22 ) f12 (f11 \u2212f22 )\u2212f12 (f11 \u2212f22\n)\n\n(29)\n\nwhere xa,b and ya,b are defined by expressions (24) and (25). Here we have assumed\nthat the vectors f11 \u2212 f22 and f12 are linearly independent. Note that the points pa\nand pb coincide in the degenerate case D = 0.\n\nAccording to conditions (20) the real eigensheets Re\u03bb+ (p) and Re\u03bb\u2212 (p) are glued\nin the interval [pa , pb ] of the line\nImc/2 = (x+Re\u03be)Im\u03be + (y+Re\u03b7)Im\u03b7 \u2212 Re\u03b6Im\u03b6 = 0, Re\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb\u20320 + Re\u03bc.\n\n(30)\n\nThe surface of real eigenvalues (18) is called a \"double coffee filter\" [Keck et al. (2003)].\nThe unfolding of a diabolic point into the double coffee filter is shown in Figure 2b.\nFrom conditions (21) it follows that the imaginary eigensheets Im\u03bb+ (p) and Im\u03bb\u2212 (p)\nare connected along the straight line (28) where the interval [pa , pb ] is excluded, see\nFigure 2b. According to the formulae (22) the angle of intersection of the imaginary eigensheets tends to \u03c0 as the points pa and pb are approached, since Rec\ngoes to zero. At far distances from the interval [pa , pb ] this angle becomes small\nof order \u03b5. With the decrease of the size of complex perturbation \u03b5 the interval\nshrinks and the angle of intersection goes to zero. At \u03b5 = 0 the imaginary parts\nof the eigenvalues coincide: Im\u03bb+ = Im\u03bb\u2212 = 0. Note that in crystal optics and\nacoustics the interval [pa , pb ] is referred to as a \"branch cut\", and the points pa , pb\nare called \"singular axes\", see [Shuvalov and Scott (2000), Berry and Dennis (2003),\nRamachandran and Ramaseshan (1961)]. According to equation (8) the double eigenvalues at pa and pb possess only one eigenvector and, hence, they are exceptional\npoints (EPs).\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: A real non-symmetric perturbation of a diabolic point.\nNow let us consider the case when the perturbation \u2206A(p) is real. In this case \u03bc,\n\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6, and hence,\nc = (x + \u03be)2 + (y + \u03b7)2 \u2212 \u03b6 2\n\n(31)\n\nare real quantities. According to (12) the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 are complex-conjugate if\nc < 0 and real if c > 0. The eigenvalues couple for c = 0 forming a set consisting of\nexceptional points with double real eigenvalues.\nConsider a system depending on a vector of two parameters p = (p1 , p2 ). Then\nequation c = 0 with expressions (13) and (31) define an ellipse in parameter plane;\nc < 0 inside the ellipse and c > 0 outside. Real parts of the eigenvalues are given by\nthe equations\nc\u22650:\n\n(Re\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u20320 \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212(x + \u03be)2 \u2212(y + \u03b7)2 = \u2212 \u03b6 2 ,\n\n(32)\n\nc\u22640:\n\nRe\u03bb = \u03bb\u20320 + \u03bc.\n\n(33)\n\nEquation (32) defines a hyperboloid in the space (p1 , p2 , Re\u03bb). Real parts of the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 coincide at the disk determined by equation (33), see Figure 3. Imaginary\nparts of the eigenvalues are\nc\u22650:\n\nIm\u03bb = 0,\n\n(34)\n\nc\u22640:\n\nIm2 \u03bb + (x + \u03be)2 +(y + \u03b7)2 = \u03b6 2 .\n\n(35)\n\nThe imaginary parts are both zero at the points of the plane (34) surrounding the\nellipsoid (35) (\"a bubble\") in the space (p1 , p2 , Im\u03bb), see Figure 3. The eigenvalues\ncouple at the points of the elliptic ring\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb\u20320 + \u03bc, (x + \u03be)2+(y + \u03b7)2 = \u03b6 2,\n10\n\n(36)\n\n\fconsisting of exceptional points, see Figure 3. By that reason we call it an \"exceptional ring\", which is a better name compared with a \"diabolic circle\" suggested by\n[Mondragon and Hernandez (1993)], [Mondragon and Hernandez (1996)].\nFinally, it is instructive to consider deformations of the surfaces (32), (33) and\n(34), (35) as the real perturbation becomes complex. If the imaginary part of the\nperturbation Im\u2206A is such that D < 0, then the parts of the hyperboloid (32)\nconnected by the disk (33) are separated into the two smooth surfaces described by\nthe equation (18). On the other hand, the ellipsoid (35) surrounded by the plane (34)\nis foliated into two sheets crossing each other along the line Imc = 0, see Figure 2a.\nRecall that the line Imc = 0 does not intersect the ellipse Rec = 0. When D > 0,\nthe disk (33) foliates into two sheets crossing along the interval [pa , pb ], where the\npoints pa and pb are given by expression (29). As the size of the imaginary part of\nthe perturbation Im\u2206A increases, the angle of intersection of real eigensheets grows.\nBy this way, the purely imaginary perturbation deforms the hyperboloid (32) into the\ndouble coffee filter (18), see Figure 2b. The ellipsoid (35) surrounded by the plane\n(34) is transformed into two smooth sheets intersecting along the line Imc = 0, where\nthe interval [pa , pb ] is excluded. The angle of intersection grows as the size of the\nperturbation Im\u2206A increases.\n\n4\n\nUnfolding of a diabolic singularity for Hermitian\nmatrices\n\nLet us consider a multi-parameter Hermitian matrix A(p). Assume that p0 is a\ndiabolic point, where the matrix A0 = A(p0 ) has a double real eigenvalue \u03bb0 with\ntwo eigenvectors. The splitting of \u03bb0 into a pair of simple real eigenvalues \u03bb+ and\n\u03bb\u2212 is described by expressions (3), (4), where the vectors f11 and f22 are real and the\nvectors f12 = f 21 are complex conjugate. By using expression (3), we find\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb\u20320 \u00b1\n\nq\n\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 ,\n\n11\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere \u03bb\u20320 , x, y, and z are real quantities depending linearly on the perturbation of\nparameters \u2206p as follows\n\u03bb\u20320 = \u03bb0 +\n\nhf11 \u2212 f22 , \u2206pi\nhf11 + f22 , \u2206pi\n, x=\n, y = hRe f12 , \u2206pi, z = hIm f12 , \u2206pi.\n2\n2\n(38)\n\nThe eigenvalues coincide if x = y = z = 0. Thus, if the system depends on three\nparameters and the real vectors f11 \u2212 f22 , Re f12 , and Im f12 are linearly independent,\n\nthe eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 split for any nonzero perturbation \u2206p. For more than\nthree parameters, the equations x = y = z = 0 with relations (38) provide a plane\nof diabolic points in parameter space. This plane has dimension n \u2212 3, which agrees\n\nwith the well-known fact that the diabolic point is a codimension 3 phenomenon for\nHermitian systems [Von Neumann and Wigner (1929), Arnold (1972)].\nNow let us consider a general non-Hermitian perturbation of the system A(p) +\n\u2206A(p), assuming that the size of perturbation at the diabolic point \u03b5 = k\u2206A(p0 )k is\n\nsmall. The two eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 , which become complex due to non-Hermitian\nperturbation, are given by asymptotic expressions (6), (7). With the use of the new\ncoordinates (38), we write the expression (6) as\n\u03bb\u00b1 = \u03bb\u20320 + \u03bc \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\nc,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\nc = (x + \u03be)2 + (y + \u03b7)2 + (z \u2212 i\u03b6)2,\n\n(40)\n\nand \u03bc, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 are small complex quantities of order \u03b5 given by expressions (14).\nThe eigenvalues couple (\u03bb+ = \u03bb\u2212 ) if c = 0. This yields two equations\nRe c = (x + Re \u03be)2 + (y + Re \u03b7)2 + (z + Im \u03b6)2 \u2212 (Im2 \u03be + Im2 \u03b7 + Re2 \u03b6) = 0,\nIm c = 2(Im \u03be(x + Re \u03be) + Im \u03b7(y + Re \u03b7) \u2212 Re \u03b6(z + Im \u03b6)) = 0.\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nEquation (41) defines a sphere in (x, y, z) space with the center at (\u2212Re \u03be, \u2212Re \u03b7, \u2212Im \u03b6)\n\nand the radius\n\nq\n\nIm2 \u03be + Im2 \u03b7 + Re2 \u03b6, which are small of order \u03b5. Equation (42) yields\n\na plane passing through the center of the sphere. The sphere and the plane intersect\nalong a circle. Points of this circle determine values of parameters, for which the\neigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 coincide. Since c = 0 at the coupling point, expression (8) for the\neigenvectors takes the form\n\u03b5\nu\u00b1 = \u03b1\u00b1\nu1 + \u03b2\u00b1\u03b5 u2 ,\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b1\u00b1\ny + iz + \u03b7 + \u03b6\nx+\u03be\n=\n=\n.\n\u03b5\n\u03b2\u00b1\n\u2212x \u2212 \u03be\ny \u2212 iz + \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b6\n\n12\n\n(43)\n\n\fFigure 4: Unfolding of a diabolic point into an exceptional ring in parameter space.\nThus, all points of the circle are exceptional points, where the two eigenvectors u\u2212\nand u+ merge in addition to the coupling of the eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 . By using the\nlinear expressions (38), the set of exceptional points is found in the original parameter\nspace p. The exceptional circle in (x, y, z) space is transformed into an exceptional\nelliptic ring in three-parameter space p, see Figure 4.\nLet us consider the plane (42), at which the quantity c is real. By formula (39),\nthe real parts of the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 coincide inside the exceptional ring, where c < 0,\nand the imaginary parts of \u03bb\u00b1 coincide outside the exceptional ring, where c > 0, see\nthe dark and light shaded areas in Figure 4.\nWe see that, under a general complex perturbation, a diabolic point of a threeparameter Hermitian system bifurcates into an exceptional ring. This ring has elliptic\nshape and grows proportionally to the size of perturbation \u03b5. The real and imaginary\nparts of the eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 coincide, respectively, inside and outside the exceptional\nring in the plane of the ring.\nFinally, let us study the stratification of parameter space given by the condition\n|Re (\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 )| = const. For problems of quantum mechanics, this difference describes\n\nthe size of a gap between two adjacent energy levels. By using expression (39), we find\n(\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 )2 = 4c. Separating real and imaginary parts in this equation and extracting\nIm (\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 ), we get\n\nRe4 (\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 ) \u2212 4Re2 (\u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 )Re c \u2212 4Im2 c = 0,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere Re c and Im c are given by the first equalities in (41) and (42).

These eigenvalues determine refractive indices n, and the corresponding\neigenvectors yield polarizations.\nThe inverse dielectric tensor is described by a complex non-Hermitian matrix \u03b7 =\n\u03b7 transp +\u03b7 dichroic +\u03b7 chiral . The symmetric part of \u03b7 consisting of the real matrix \u03b7 transp\nand imaginary matrix \u03b7 dichroic constitute the anisotropy tensor, which describes the\nbirefringence of the crystal. For a transparent crystal, the anisotropy tensor is real\nand is represented only by the matrix \u03b7 transp ; for a crystal with linear dichroism it is\ncomplex.

The third\nq\n\ncomponent of the direction vector s is found as s3 = \u00b1 1 \u2212 s21 \u2212 s22 , where the cases\n\nof two different signs should be considered separately. Below we assume that three\n\ndielectric constants \u03b71 > \u03b72 > \u03b73 are different. This corresponds to biaxial anisotropic\ncrystals.\nThe nonzero eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 of the matrix A(p) are found explicitly in the form\n[Lewin (1994)]\ntrace A 1 q\n\u00b1\n2 trace (A2 ) \u2212 (trace A)2 .\n(54)\n2\n2\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 are the same for opposite directions s and \u2212s. By using (50) and\n\u03bb\u00b1 =\n\n(53) in (54), it is straightforward to show that two eigenvalues \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 couple at\nq\n\nq\n\ns0 = (S1 , S2 , S3 ), \u03bb0 = \u03b72 ; S1 = \u00b1 (\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 )/(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b73 ), S2 = 0, S3 = \u00b1 1 \u2212 S12 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhich determine four diabolic points (for two signs of S1 and S3 ), also called optic\naxes [Ramachandran and Ramaseshan (1961)].

Conical surfaces\n(58) are shown in Figure 6 together with the exact eigenvalue surfaces (54). The two\n\u221a\noptic axes presented in Figure 6 are s0 = (\u00b11/2, 0, 3/2) with the double eigenvalue\n\u221a\n\u03bb0 = 2/5; the eigenvalue surfaces for the opposite directions s0 = (\u00b11/2, 0, \u2212 3/2)\nare exactly the same.\n\nNow let us assume that the crystal possesses absorption and chirality. Then the\nmatrix family (53) takes a complex perturbation A(p) + \u2206A(p), where\n\u2206A(p) = (I \u2212 ssT )(\u03b7 dichroic + \u03b7 chiral )(I \u2212 ssT ).\n\n(59)\n\nAssume that the absorption and chirality are weak, i.e., \u03b5 = k\u03b7 dichroic k + k\u03b7 chiral k is\nsmall. Then we can use asymptotic formulae of Sections 2 and 3 to describe unfolding\nof diabolic singularities of the eigenvalue surfaces. For this purpose, we need to know\nonly the value of the perturbation \u2206A at the optic axes of the transparent non-chiral\ncrystal s0 .\nSubstituting matrix (59) evaluated at optic axes (55) into expression (7), we obtain\nd\n\u03b511 = i\u03b722\n,\n\nd\nd\nd\n\u03b522 = i\u03b711\nS32 \u2212 2i\u03b713\nS1 S3 + i\u03b733\nS12 ,\n\nd\nd\n\u03b512 = \u2212i(\u03b723\n+ \u03b311 S1 + \u03b313 S3 )S1 + i(\u03b712\n\u2212 \u03b313 S1 \u2212 \u03b333 S3 )S3 ,\nd\nd\n\u03b521 = \u2212i(\u03b723\n\u2212 \u03b311 S1 \u2212 \u03b313 S3 )S1 + i(\u03b712\n+ \u03b313 S1 + \u03b333 S3 )S3 .\n\n17\n\n(60)\n\n\fBy using formulae (14), we get\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\u03bc = i(\u03b722\n+ \u03b711\nS32 \u2212 2\u03b713\nS1 S3 + \u03b733\nS12 )/2,\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\u03be = i(\u03b722\n\u2212 \u03b711\nS32 + 2\u03b713\nS1 S3 \u2212 \u03b733\nS12 )/2,\n\n(61)\n\nd\nd\n\u03b7 = i(\u03b712\nS3 \u2212 \u03b723\nS1 ),\n\n\u03b6 = \u2212i (\u03b311 S12 + 2\u03b313 S1 S3 + \u03b333 S32 ) .\n\nWe see that \u03bc, \u03be, and \u03b7 are purely imaginary numbers depending only on dichroic\nproperties of the crystal (absorption). The quantity \u03b6 depends only on chiral properties of the crystal; \u03b6 is purely imaginary if the optical activity tensor \u03b3 is real.\nSingularities for crystals with weak dichroism and chirality were studied recently\nin [Berry and Dennis (2003)]. It was shown that the double coffee filter singularity\narises in absorption-dominated crystals, and the sheets of real parts of eigenvalues\nare separated in chirality-dominated crystals. According to the results of Section 3,\nthese two cases are explicitly determined by the conditions D > 0 and D < 0, respectively, where D = Im2 \u03be + Im2 \u03b7 \u2212 Im2 \u03b6. These conditions are new and important\nbecause they provide quantitative definitions of absorption-dominated and chirality-\n\ndominated regimes for unfolding of the diabolic singularity in terms of components\nof the inverse dielectric tensor. Indeed, according to (61), \u03be and \u03b7 depend linearly on\nall the components of the tensor \u03b7 dichroic , while \u03b6 depends linearly on the components\n\u03b3ij , i, j = 1, 3 of the optical activity tensor \u03b3.\nNote that according to the sign of the quantity D taken at different optic axes we\ncan classify crystals by their optic properties. For example, the important case is a\nchirality-dominated crystal with D < 0 for all four optic axes. Then real parts of the\neigenvalues separate for all directions s.\nThere are four optic axes (55), which determine two pairs of opposite space direction \u00b1s0 . It is easy to see that the unfolding conditions coincide for the optic axes\n\ngiven by opposite directions, while these conditions are different for different pairs\nof optic axes. In the absorption-dominated case, when diabolic singularities unfold\ninto coffee-filters near two opposite optic axes \u00b1s0 = \u00b1(S1 , 0, S3 ), the four exceptional\npoints of eigenvalue coupling \u00b1sa and \u00b1sb (also called singular axes) appear. By using\n(57) in (13), we obtain the asymptotic formulae\nsa,b\n1\n\nxa,b\n,\n= S1 +\n(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b73 )S1\n\nsa,b\n2\n\nya,b\n=\n,\n(\u03b73 \u2212 \u03b71 )S1 S3\n18\n\nsa,b\n3\n\n=\n\nr\n\n2\n\n2\n\na,b\n1 \u2212 (sa,b\n1 ) \u2212 (s2 ) , (62)\n\n\ffor the components of the vectors sa,b , where xa,b and ya,b are found by using expressions (24), (25), and (61). In particular, for non-chiral crystals, we have \u03b6 = 0.\nd\nd\nThen expressions (24), (25) yield xa,b = \u00b1Im \u03b7 = \u03b712\nS3 \u2212 \u03b723\nS1 and ya,b = \u2213Im \u03be =\n\nd\nd\nd\nd\n(\u03b722\n\u2212 \u03b711\nS32 + 2\u03b713\nS1 S3 \u2212 \u03b733\nS12 )/2.\n\nEquation Im c = 0 determines a line of singularities in the parameter space p =\n\n(s1 , s2 ). By using (57), (61) in (13), (17), we find this line in the form\n(s1 \u2212 S1 )S1 (\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b73 )Im \u03be \u2212 s2 S1 S3 (\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b73 ) Im \u03b7 \u2212 Re \u03b6 Im \u03b6 = 0.\n\n(63)\n\nIn the absorption-dominated case, line (63) contains two exceptional points pa,b =\na,b\n(sa,b\n1 , s2 ) corresponding to the singular axes sa,b . A segment between the points pa\n\nand pb corresponds to the coincidence of real parts of the eigenvalues Re \u03bb+ = Re \u03bb\u2212 ,\nwhile imaginary parts of the eigenvalues Im \u03bb+ = Im \u03bb\u2212 merge at points of line (63)\noutside this segment, see Figure 2b. In the chirality-dominated case, when singular\naxes do not appear, imaginary parts of the eigenvalues Im \u03bb+ = Im \u03bb\u2212 coincide at\npoints of the whole line (63), see Figure 2a. If the optical activity tensor \u03b3 is real or\npurely imaginary, then the line of singularities (63) passes through the diabolic point\np0 , and position of this line does not depend on \u03b3.\nAs a numerical example, let us consider a crystal possessing weak absorption and\nchirality described by the tensors (51), (52) with\n\u03b7 dichroic =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n3 2 0\n\ni \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 2 3 1\n200 \uf8ed\n0 1 3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03b3=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n3 1 2\n\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 1 3 1\n200 \uf8ed\n2 1 3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(64)\n\nA corresponding transparent non-chiral crystal is characterized by \u03b71 = 0.5, \u03b72 = 0.4,\n\u03b73 = 0.1, and its eigenvalue surfaces with two optic axes are presented in Figure 6.\n\u221a\n7\nBy using (64) in (61), we find that the condition D = 160000\n(4 3 \u2212 5) > 0 is satisfied\n\u221a\nfor the left optic axis s0 = (\u22121/2, 0, 3/2).

Hence, the eigenvalue sheets (for real parts)\nD = \u2212 160000\n\nseparate under the bifurcation of the right diabolic singularity.

As it is seen\nfrom Figure 7, the asymptotic formulae provide an accurate description for unfolding\nof eigenvalue surfaces near diabolic points.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nNon-Hermitian Hamiltonians and matrices usually appear in physics when dissipative\nand other non-conservative effects are taken into account. The known examples are\ncomplex refractive indices in optics and complex potentials describing the scattering\n20\n\n\fof electrons or X-rays. Traditionally, non-Hermitian matrices appear in physics as\na perturbation of Hermitian matrices. As it is stated in [Berry (2004)], Hermitian\nphysics differs radically from non-Hermitian physics in case of coalescence (coupling)\nof eigenvalues. In the present paper we have studied this important case carefully.\nWe gave analytical description for unfolding of eigenvalue surfaces due to an arbitrary\ncomplex perturbation with the singularities known in the literature as a \"double coffeefilter\" and a \"diabolic circle\". We emphasize that the developed theory requires only\neigenvectors and derivatives of the matrices taken at the singular point, while the\nsize of the matrix and its dependence on parameters are arbitrary. This makes the\npresented theory powerful and practical for a wide class of physical problems. The\ngiven physical example from crystal optics demonstrates applicability and accuracy\nof the theory.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe work is supported by the research grants RFBR-NSFC 02-01-39004, RFBR 0301-00161, and CRDF-BRHE Y1-MP-06-19.\n\nReferences\n[Von Neumann and Wigner (1929)] Von Neumann J. and Wigner E.P. \u00dcber das Verhalten von Eigenwerten bei adiabatischen Prozessen.
