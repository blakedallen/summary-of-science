We find a collective excitation, a plasmon, at energies smaller than two times the gap parameter and momenta smaller than\nabout eight times the gap. The dispersion relation of this mode exhibits a minimum at some nonzero\nvalue of momentum, indicating a van Hove singularity.\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Mh, 24.85.+p\n\nSingle-gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in the color-antitriplet channel. Therefore, sufficiently cold\nand dense quark matter is a color superconductor [1]. When the quark-chemical potential \u03bc \u226b \u039bQCD , asymptotic\nfreedom [2] implies that the strong coupling constant g at the scale \u03bc is much smaller than unity, g(\u03bc) \u226a 1. This\nallows a controlled calculation of the color-superconducting gap parameter \u03c6 in the weak-coupling limit.\nIt is of interest to study the existence and the properties of collective gluonic excitations in a color superconductor.\nTo this end, one has to compute the gluon self-energy, which allows to determine the gluon spectral density. At small\ntemperatures T \u223c \u03c6 \u226a \u03bc, the dominant contribution to the one-loop gluon self-energy comes from a quark loop; it is\n\u223c g 2 \u03bc2 , while gluon (and ghost) loops contribute a term \u223c g 2 T 2 and are thus suppressed [3]. In this note, we focus\non the gluon self-energy in the color-flavor-locking (CFL) phase which is characterized by an order parameter of the\nform\nijk\n\u03a6ij\n\u01ebf gh \u03a6kh ,\nfg = \u01eb\n\n, \u03a6kh \u2261 \u03c6 \u03b4hk ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i, j, k are (fundamental) color indices and f, g, h are flavor indices.\nTo calculate the gluon self-energy in the CFL phase, we start from Eq. (31a) (the self-energy of electric gluons)\nand Eq. (31b) (the self-energy of magnetic gluons) of Ref. [4]. We then take the zero-temperature limit and, using\nthe Dirac identity\n1\n1\n= P \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(x) ,\nx + i\u03b7\nx\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P denotes the principal value prescription, we find the imaginary parts of the electric and magnetic selfenergies. The contribution from antiquarks in the one-loop self-energies can be neglected, as the interesting range of\ngluon energies is p0 \u226a \u03bc. The imaginary part of the self-energies for electric and magnetic gluons are depicted in Fig.\n1, together with the results for vanishing gap parameter, which corresponds to the hard-dense loop (HDL) limit. As\nin a two-flavor color superconductor, the imaginary parts vanish for values of the gluon energy smaller than twice the\ngap parameter \u03c6. This means that at energies smaller than 2\u03c6 it is impossible to excite quasiparticle-quasihole pairs\nwhich would lead to non-vanishing imaginary parts. Above the light cone, for gluon energies p0 > 4\u03c6, the imaginary\npart of the HDL self-energy vanishes. In the color-superconducting case, this no longer holds true, but at least the\nimaginary parts decrease rapidly.\nIn order to compute the real parts of the gluon self-energy, one can follow two approaches. Either, one computes it\ndirectly from Eq. (2) as a principal value integral, or one employs the dispersion integral\n1\nRe \u03a0(p0 , p) \u2261 P\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0010\nd\u03c9 Im\u03a0(\u03c9, p)\n\n1 \u0011\n1\n+C ,\n+\n\u03c9 + p0\n\u03c9 \u2212 p0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere C is a subtraction constant. These constants are extracted from the behavior of the self-energies at large\nenergies and thus have the same values as in the normal-conducting case, C 00 = 0 and C t = m2g , for details see Ref.\n[5].

Figure (a) shows the real\npart for electric gluons and (b) the corresponding one for magnetic gluons. The solid lines are for the CFL phase and the\ndotted lines for normal-conducting matter in the HDL limit.\n\nLet us first consider the results for the real part of the electric self-energy. In Fig. 2(a) there is a logarithmic\nsingularity at p0 = 2\u03c6 caused by the discontinuity of the respective imaginary part at the same point. This singularity\nmoves toward p0 = 0 as \u03c6 \u2192 0. The change of the gradient of the imaginary part at p0 = 3\u03c6 produces a corresponding\nchange in the real part. The peak of the imaginary part at p0 = 4.5\u03c6, followed by a rapid decrease, produces a cusp\nin the real part at the same energy. The cusp at p0 = 5\u03c6 is due to the variation in the gradient of the imaginary part.\nThe discussion of the real part of the magnetic self-energy proceeds along similar lines. Because of the two discontinuities at p0 = 2\u03c6 and p0 = 3\u03c6 in Fig. 1(b) there are two logarithmic singularities at the same energies in the real\nparts. Because of the change in the gradient at p0 = 4\u03c6 there is also a change of gradient in the real part. For p0 \u226b \u03c6\nthe real parts of the self-energies approach the corresponding HDL limit. As one would expect, deviations from the\nHDL limit show up only for p0 \u223c \u03c6.\nFrom Eq. (46) of Ref. [5] we infer the spectral densities for the case Im\u03a000,t (p0 , p) 6= 0,\n1\nIm\u03a000 (p0 , p)\n,\n\u03c0 [p2 \u2212 Re\u03a000 (p0 , p)]2 + [Im\u03a000 (p0 , p)]2\nIm\u03a0t (p0 , p)\n1\n.\n\u03c1t (p0 , p) =\n\u03c0 [p20 \u2212 p2 \u2212 Re\u03a0t (p0 , p)]2 + [Im\u03a0t (p0 , p)]2\n\u03c100 (p0 , p) =\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n\n\f3\nIf Im\u03a000,t (p0 , p) = 0, the spectral densities have simple poles.
