Heavy quark production cross section\nThe heavy quark production cross section in H1 -H2 collisions can be\nillustrated by the formula:\n\u03c3\n\nH1 ,H2\n\n=\n\nXZ\n\ndx1 dx2 fi (x1 )H1 fj (x2 )H2 \u03c3ij (x1 , x2 , s)\n\n(1)\n\ni,j\n\nwhere \u03c3ij (x1 , x2 , s) is the perturbative partonic cross section for two hardscatterings to produce a pair of heavy quarks which depends in particular\non the available energy. This parton level cross section is calculable as a\npower series in the strong coupling \u03b1s which depends on the renormalisation\nscale. The nucleon Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) fi/j (x1 /x2 )H1 /H2\ngives the probability to find the parton i/j in a nucleon of type H1 /H2 as\na function of fraction the x1 /x2 of the nucleon's momentum carried by the\nparton. The PDFs are non-perturbative objects and thus cannot be calculated from first principles. They are extracted from the structure functions\nof the nucleon in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments. The comprehension of PDFs is mandatory to make any predictions about heavy flavor\nproduction.\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\nPresented at Excited QCD 2009, winter meeting on QCD, 8-14 February 09, Zakopane, Poland\nMagdalena.Malek@cern.ch\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nM.Malek\n\nExcited QCD, 2009\n\n2. Parton structure and evolution equations\n2.1. Parton distribution in linear regime\nThe DGLAP (Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) [1] evolution\nequation applicable in the Bjorken limit (Q2 \u2192 \u221e and fixed x) takes into\naccount the Q2 dependence of the PDFs. It allows a resummation of leading\npowers of [\u03b1s ln(Q2 )]n generated by a parton cascade in a region of the\nphase space where the transverse momenta of gluons are strongly ordered:\n2\n2\n2 . In this approach the transverse\nQ2 \u001d knt\n\u001d k(n\u22121)t\n\u001d . . . \u001d k1t\nmomenta of the initial partons are neglected.\nAt high energy (or decreasing x), the probability of gluon emission increases\nas \u03b1s ln(1/x). In this regime, the transverse momenta of the partons are of\nthe same order of magnitude than the longitudinal ones and thus have to be\ntaken into account in the reaction dynamics description. When the gluon\ndensity N is not too high, the modification of the gluon distribution with\nincreasing energy can be described by the BFKL (Balitsky-Fadin-KuraevLipatov) evolution equation [2]. This equation can be used in the Regge\nlimit (s \u2192 \u221e and fixed Q2 ) of QCD. The PDFs are described in terms of kt \u2212\nunintegrated PDFs \u03c6(x, kt ) related to the usual gluon distribution xg(x, Q2 )\nR 2\nby xg(x, Q2 ) \u223c 0Q d2 kt \u03c6(x, kt ). This is essentially a linear equation and\nits solution at asymptotically large energies shows an exponential growth\nof the number of gluons. This unlimited growth of the gluon density leads\nultimately to a violation of the unitarity bound for the cross section. The\nBFKL equation must be modified so as not to violate the unitarity.\n2.2. Non-linear evolution and parton saturation\nAt some small enough value of x, the gluon density is so large that the\nnon-linear gluon recombination becomes important. The gluon density per\nunit area of the nucleus with atomic number A is \u03c1A \u223c xgA (x, Q2 )/A2/3 and\nthe gluon recombination cross section is \u03c3gg\u2192g \u223c \u03b1s /Q2 . The border line\nbetween the linear and non-linear regimes is given by the saturation scale\nQs satisfying \u03c1A \u03c3gg\u2192 g = 1. The gluon recombination becomes important\nwhen \u03c1A \u03c3gg\u2192 g > 1 thus Q2 \u2264 Q2s with Q2s \u223c \u03b1s xgA (x, Q2s )/A2/3 . Partons\nwith Q2 > Q2s are not affected by saturation, evolution goes towards the\ndilute system, and can be described by DGLAP or BFKL equations. On the\nother hand, partons with Q2 < Q2s are in the saturation regime and their\nevolution is described by the non-linear JIMWLK (Jalilian Marian-IancuMcLerran-Weigert-Leonidov-Kovner) equation [3]. This equation can be\nschematized by:\n\u2202N (kt , y)\n' c1 N (kt , y) \u2212 \u03b1s c2 N 2 (kt , y)\n\u2202y\n\n(2)\n\n\fM.Malek\n\nExcited QCD, 2009\n\n3\n\nwith rapidity y \u2261 log(1/x) and constant parameters c1,2 of the order of one.\nOne remarks that the gluon recombination (or quadratic term) becomes\nimportant when N reaches 1/\u03b1s . The gluon production stops growing,\nthis is the so called gluon saturation. The saturation phenomena can be\ndescribed by an effective theory: the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). The\nCGC is a new form of nuclear matter which controls hadronic interactions at\nasymptotically large energies. The origin of the name is the following. First\nof all, the CGC is made of small-x gluons which carry the color charge.\nNext, these small-x gluons are created by partons with larger x which act\nas a frozen color source, glass, for the emission of small-x gluons. Lastly,\ncondensate because the soft degrees of freedom are as densely packed as\nthey can.\n3. Low-x QCD studies at LHC with ALICE\nThe LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN will provide, at nominal\n\u221a\noperating conditions, p+p, Pb+p and Pb+Pb collisions at sN N = 14,\n8.8 and 5.5 TeV respectively with luminosities L \u223c 1034 , 1029 and 5\u00d71026\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . These conditions allow to access unprecedentedly low values of\nthe Bjorken-x variable. The copious production of heavy quarks (charm and\nbeauty) can be used as a probe of low-x QCD phenomena. At LHC energies heavy quarks are mainly produced through gluon-gluon fusion processes\nthus their production cross sections are significantly affected by parton dynamics in the small-x regime.\nALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [4] is the experiment dedicated\nto study the properties of matter created in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC.\nThe detector contains a wide array of sub-detectors for measuring hadrons,\nleptons and photons. Table 1 shows the x regimes for the production of cc\nand bb pairs at SPS, RHIC and LHC (for ALICE) energies. As we can see\nin Tab. 1 the increase of the collision energy involves the decrease of the\nvalue of the Bjorken-x.\nMachine\nSystem\nEnergy (GeV)\n\nSPS\nPb+Pb\n17\n\nRHIC\nAu+Au\n200\n\nLHC\nPb+Pb\n5500\n\nLHC\np+p\n14000\n\ncc\nbb\n\nx ' 10\u22121\n-\n\nx ' 10\u22122\n-\n\nx ' 4 \u00d7 10\u22124\nx ' 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nx ' 2 \u00d7 10\u22124\nx ' 6 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\nTable 1.

Simulations: setup\nThe simulation of the heavy quark production within the CGC framework is performed with the AliRoot [5] simulation code. The theoretical\ningredients (PDF and partonic cross section) of Eq. 1 for each approach\nare discussed in next sections. The results are compared to the reference\nsimulations for the ALICE experiment (PYTHIA) that are based on the\nMangano-Nason-Ridolfi (MNR) calculation [6]. The comparison between\np+p and Pb+p collisions allows to draw preliminary conclusions about the\nCGC observation with the ALICE muon spectrometer [7] covering the forward pseudo-rapidity region (-4\u2264 \u03b7 \u2264-2,5).\nCollinear factorization: PYTHIA tuned to MNR\n\n\u2022 p+p collisions are simulated with PYTHIA tuned to reproduce heavy\nquark production cross sections obtained with MNR calculation. The\nCTEQ [8] parametrization of the proton PDF is used.\n\u2022 Pb+p collisions are simulated from p+p ones using Glauber geometric\nmodel [9] to calculate the number of binary collisions. Shadowing\neffects in the gluon distribution are added by hand, using a nuclear\nmodification factor. This factor, not well known at LHC energies, can\nbe calculated using different parametrization methods. In this study\nwe used the EKS98 parametrization [10]. Within this model, the\ntransverse momentum kt of partons is given by means of a Gaussian\ndistribution with a zero mean value and a width (\u03c3 = | kt |) that\ndepends on the considered flavor and the colliding system. For p+p\nand Pb+p collisions, this parameter is respectively fixed to 1 and 1.16\nGeV/c for charm, and 1 and 1.6 GeV/c for beauty.\nCGC approach\n\nIn this approach the proton PDF is given by the non-saturated CTEQ\nparametrization. The lead structure is described by the PDF taking into\naccount the saturation effects. More precisely, it contains the multiple scattering corrections in the partonic cross section and the non-linear terms of\nthe JIMWLK equation. The initial condition for the JIMWLK equation is\ncalculated for x = 10\u22122 using the McLerran-Venugoplan model [11].\n3.2. Results on heavy quarks level\nWe calculate the charm and beauty production cross section and their\ndN bp /dydpt\nratios for both approaches. The ratio RP bp = NcollPdN\ndefines the\npp /dydpt\nnuclear modification factor that can be calculated from experimental data.\n\n\fM.Malek\n\nExcited QCD, 2009\n\n5\n\napproach\n\ncc\ndNPccbp /dNpp\n\nbb\ndNPbbbp /dNpp\n\nbb /dN cc\ndNpp\npp\n\ndNPbbbp /dNPccbp\n\nMNR with EKS98\nCGC\n\n0.77\n0.60\n\n0.85\n0.80\n\n0.03\n0.10\n\n0.04\n0.14\n\nTable 2.\nProduction ratios of charm and beauty in Pb+p collisions at\n\u221a\nsN N = 8.8 TeV normalized to the number of binary collisions Ncoll and cross\nsection ratios between beauty and charm for rapidity y < 0 in MNR and CGC\napproaches.\n\nThe results are given in Tab. 2. One remarks that the values of shadowing\nfactors for beauty are very close in both models. For charm, these factors\nare very different. It shows that the gluon recombination effects are more\nimportant in the CGC approach that in the MNR one. In fact, the cc pairs\nare produced, on average, by fusion of gluons at smaller x than the ones\nM\n\nproducing the bb pairs (x = \u221asQQ\nexp(\u00b1yQQ )). Since small-x gluons are\nNN\nmore sensitive to recombination effects, these are more visible in the charm\ncase.\nTable 2 gives also the cross section ratios for beauty over charm production.\nOne sees that the MNR approach always predicts a ratio smaller than 5%,\nwhereas the CGC approach gives a ratio larger than 10%.\nThe evolution of the nuclear modification factor RP bp as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity is presented in Fig. 1. One remarks that\n\nFig. 1. RP bp ratios as a function of pt (left part) and rapidity (right part).\n\nbelow \u223c4 GeV/c, in the CGC approach, the depletion for charm is much\nmore important than for beauty. It can be understood by recombination\nand multiple scattering of small-x gluons which are responsible for charm\nproduction. This effect is less pronounced in the MNR + EKS98 approach.\n\n\f6\n\nM.Malek\n\nExcited QCD, 2009\n\nShadowing effects are also visible from the rapidity dependence of RP bp .\nBoth approaches show the decrease of this ratio at high rapidities but it is\nclearly more noticeable, for both flavors, in the CGC approach.\n3.3. Results on hadron and muon level\nNext, the quark fragmentation into heavy hadrons was performed. The\ndecay of produced hadrons through their semi-muonic channel was applied.\nFinally, the transport of produced muons through the muon spectrometer\nwas completed [12]. It is important to highlight that a full AliRoot simulation was used to transport particles and to reconstruct their tracks; thus\na realistic signal generation from the full detector response and a complete\nclustering and tracking procedure were applied.\nReconstructed single muon spectra are studied in this part. The shift of\nthe center of mass frame with respect to the laboratory one, by \u03b4y = 0.47\nfor Pb+p collisions, is taken into account. This kinematical shift constrains\nthe rapidity window where the RP bp can be measured; the ratio will correspond to muons with y \u2208 [-2.97,-4] for p+p collisions and muons with\ny \u2208 [-2.5,-3.53] for Pb+p collisions.\n\nFig. 2. RP bp ratio for muons from charm and beauty reconstructed in the ALICE\nmuon spectroometer. The left (right) plot corresponds to the results obtained with\nthe CGC (MNR) model.\n\nThe ratio RP bp , presented in Fig. 2 as a function of pt for muons from\ncharm and beauty, exhibits a similar behavior for both flavours in the two\nmodels. The observation of the saturation effects via the RP bp ratio will be\ndifficult at low pt (pt < 2 GeV/c) in the ALICE muon spectrometer due\nto the different experimental cuts.\n\n\fM.Malek\n\nExcited QCD, 2009\n\n7\n\n4. Conclusions\nThe main purpose of this work was to investigate the predictions of the\nCGC approach in the case of charm and beauty production rates for the\nALICE experiment. The results were compared to the reference simulations\nof ALICE which are based on the MNR calculation. It was observed that the\nheavy quark production is affected by small-x effects in the low pt region. It\nwas shown that the shadowing effects are much more significant in the case of\nthe CGC approach. It was also seen that the Cronin effect is very important\nin the CGC framework, especially for charm which is more affected because\nof its smaller mass.\nThe muon level results were obtained from realistic simulations containing\nthe muon spectrometer response function. Finally, we conclude that to\nobserve experimentally small-x effects with the muon spectrometer of the\nALICE detector a very challenging analysis has to be done.\nREFERENCES\n[1] V.N.
