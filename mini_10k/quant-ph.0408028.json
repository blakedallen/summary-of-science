The stationary phase method is applied to diffusion by a potential barrier for\nan incoming wave packet with energies greater then the barrier height. It is observed\nthat a direct application leads to paradoxical results. The correct solution, confirmed\nby numerical calculations is the creation of multiple peaks as a consequence of multiple\nreflections. Lessons concerning the use of the stationary phase method are drawn.\nPACS. 03.65.Xp\n\nThe stationary phase method (SPM), first introduced to physics by Stokes and Kelvin [1], provides\nan approximate way to calculate the maximum of an integral. It has in time become a standard tool\nin the armory, not only of physicists but biologists, economists etc. [2]. Below we shall briefly sketch\nthe method. One of its main attractions is the apparent insignificance of details of the integrand with\nthe exception of its phase. Already within its description, a series of limitations and assumptions are\nmade. While these are known to the experts they are often assumed implicitly and tested indirectly\na posteriori by the success or otherwise of the results obtained.\nRecently much interest in the physics community has been stirred by the results of this method\napplied to tunnelling times in a potential barrier [3]. This has resulted in predictions of superluminal\nvelocities, or more precisely to tunnelling times which, in the so-called opaque limit, are independent\nof the barrier length. Now, while not addressing this question directly in this paper, we investigate\nwhat we consider a simpler but related problem: The (non-relativistic) diffusion of an incoming single\nwave packet with energy spectrum totally above the barrier height. We first show that a direct\napplication of the SPM analogous to the tunneling case (energy spectrum below the barrier height)\nalso leads to surprising, not to say, paradoxical results. We have then performed numerical calculations\nwhich clearly display secondary reflected and transmitted peaks. This stimulates the assumption of\nmultiple reflections which when combined with the SPM yields excellent agreement with our numerical\ncalculations. The primary lesson that we draw is that the SPM without additional knowledge such\nas the number of wave packets existing is ambiguous and whence meaningless. For diffusion problems\nthe conservation of probabilities can in principle be used to eliminate this ambiguity.\nConsider a complex integral over an unspecified range of the form\nZ\nZ\nI =\nF (k) dk = |F (k)| exp[i \u03b8(k)] dk ,\n(1)\nfor which |F (k)| has a single maximum within the range of integration at k = k0 . If \u03b8(k) varies\nsufficiently smoothly within the interval where |F (k)| is appreciable, we can expand \u03b8(k) about the\n\n\f2\n\nAlex E. Bernardini Stefano De Leo, Pietro P. Rotelli: above barrier potential diffusion\n\npoint k = k0 in a Taylor series\n\u03b8(k) = \u03b80 + (k \u2212 k0 ) \u03b80\u2032 + O[(k \u2212 k0 )2 ] ,\nwhere\n\nd\u03b8(k)\n.\ndk k = k0\nIf the modulus of F (k) is sufficiently sharply peaked we can neglect the second and higher order terms\nin the above series. This allow us to approximate the integral in Eq.(1) by\nZ\nI \u2248 exp[i \u03b80 ] |F (k)| exp[i (k \u2212 k0 ) \u03b80\u2032 ] d(k \u2212 k0 ) ,\n(2)\n\u03b80 \u2261 \u03b8(k0 )\n\nand\n\n\u03b8\u2032 0 \u2261\n\nHowever, if \u03b80\u2032 is large the function of k which is to be integrated oscillates rapidly and, consequently,\nthis integral will be practically null. A significant contribution occurs only when, for appropriate\nvalues of any parameters within \u03b8(k),\n\u03b8\u2032 0 = 0 .\n(3)\nIn this study we consider a modulated plane wave and are interested in the configuration space\nwave function in one dimension x,\nZ\n\u03c8(x, t) = |F (k)| exp[i\u03bb(k)] exp[i(kx \u2212 Et)] dk\n(4)\nwith E = k 2 /2m for non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The F (k) may be a gaussian or similar\nmodulation function. The total phase is\n\u03b8(k; x, t) = kx \u2212\n\nk2\nt + \u03bb(k) ,\n2m\n\n(5)\n\nand the condition \u03b80\u2032 = 0 then yields the x-t dependence of the maximum or peak of |\u03c8(x, t)|. For\nexample, when \u03bb(k) = 0, we obtain the group velocity result for a free wave packet\nx=\n\nk0\nt.\nm\n\n(6)\n\nThe existence of a \u03bb(k) produces a time or space shift\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk0\nm\u03bb\u20320\nk0\nk0\n\u2032\nx=\nt\u2212\n=\nt \u2212 \u03bb0 =\n(t \u2212 \u2206t) .\nm\nm\nk0\nm\nIt is exactly this type of analysis which leads to a delay time in the reflection of an incoming wave\npacket impacting upon a step potential when the momentum or energy spectrum is totally contained\nbelow the step height [5]. A similar analysis has been used for tunnelling times [6].\nThe standard procedure in these one dimensional potential problems is to find the stationary (but\nnot normalizable) plane wave solutions with the appropriate continuity conditions (see below) and\nthen pass to a normalized wave packet by means of a modulating function. While the plane waves\nexist at all times in an infinite range of x, the wave packet is predicted by the SPM to exist for the\nincoming wave for say t < 0 (with appropriate chosen time origin) while the reflected wave and other\nwaves exist only for t > 0. Around t = 0 we will have interference effects, due to the simultaneous\npresence of both incoming and reflected wave, and for the below barrier case we also have (over this\ntransitory period) a wave function within the classically forbidden barrier region.\nIn the following figure, we show the potential barrier\nV (x)\n\u273b\n\uf8f1\nE0 .....................................................\n\uf8f20\nx < 0,\n0 < x < l,\nV0\nV (x) = V0\n\uf8f30\nl < x,\nRegion I Region II Region III\n\n0\n\nl\n\n\u2732x\n\n\fAlex E.

Truncation is needed, at least\nfor small k as indicated in Eq.(7), since we wish to avoid any tunnelling phenomena.

The coefficients A(k) and\nB(k) are the right and left going amplitudes in region II. All amplitudes are to be modulated by the\nfunction g(k) eventually.

For example, in the simplest case when g(k) is a real function\nwe obtain\n\u03b8inc (k) =\n\u03b8R (k) =\n\u03b8A (k) =\n\u03b8B (k) =\n\u03b8T (k) =\n\nkx \u2212 Et ,\n\u03bb(k) \u2212 \u03c02 \u2212 kx \u2212 Et ,\n\u03bb(k) + q(x \u2212 l) \u2212 Et ,\n\u03bb(k) + q(l \u2212 x) \u2212 Et ,\n\u03bb(k) + k(x \u2212 l) \u2212 Et .\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nThe presence of the phase term \u03bb(k) implies a delay time in the reflected wave analogous to what\nhappens for the step potential when E < V0 . Since the phase of the incoming wave contains only the\nplane wave factors, i.e., it is devoid of a \u03bb(k), the incoming peak reaches the barrier at x = 0 at time\nt = 0 (neglecting interference effects). For the reflected peak with the above expression for \u03b8R (k), we\nfind the position of the peak of the reflected wave to be at\nx = \u03bb\u2032 (k0 ) \u2212 (k0 /m) t ,\nwith\n\u03bb\u2032 (k0 ) =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n2\n2 (k 2 + q 2 ) k 2 ql \u2212 (k 2 \u2212 q 2 ) sin[ql ] cos[ql ]\n.\n2\nq\n4k 2 q 2 + (k 2 \u2212 q 2 ) sin2 [ql ]\nk = k0\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nNote that only x < 0 is physical in this result since the reflected wave, by definition, lies in region I.\nThe above expression for the position of the reflected peak simplifies around the \"resonance\" values\nfor k0 (q0 ) where\nsin[q0 l ] = 0 ,\ni.e. q0 l = n \u03c0 ,\nwith n a non-negative integer.

We can calculate a delay time even for the B-wave at x = 0 since it\nexists in region II. However, this is later than the time of the B-wave at x = l since it is left-moving\ni.e. as a consequence of the q(l \u2212 x) factor in Eq.(10). Suffice it to say that it arrives at x = 0 at a later\ntime than the departure times of either the R or A wave peaks. For completeness the transmitted T\nwave packet has its peak at the start of region III, x = l, at the time\ntres\n= tres\n.\nT\nR\nNow already one may be somewhat surprised to note that the appearance of the transmitted wave\ncoincides with that of the reflected wave. However, the above results become paradoxical as soon as\none realizes that for the time interval from t = 0 to t = \u2206tres\n< \u2206tres\nthis solution is devoid of any\nA\nR\nmaximum (R, A, B or T ). During this time, at least, we are clearly in contradiction with probability\nconservation since the incoming wave peak has disappeared at time t = 0. By choosing the wave packet\ndimensions small enough we can say that there is an interval of time in which the naive SPM says there\nare no significant amplitudes anywhere in x. Note however that this is only an heuristic argument\nsince a peaked configuration space packet runs counter to the above resonance approximation (peaked\nmomentum distribution). There are also other incongruities in this naive application of the SPM. If\none recalls the well known step case with E > V0 , single peak reflection occurs instantaneously (zero\ndelay time). One might expect that our results tend to this case in the limit l \u2192 \u221e. This is not the\ncase. It is also possible in some off-resonance cases to find negative \"delay times\". In these latter cases\nthe maximum of the reflected wave and incoming wave would exist contemporaneously. This situation\nalso implies problems with probability conservation.\nNumerical calculations automatically conserve probabilities, at least to within the numerical errors.\nSo to understand what is happening we performed such calculations and an example of these is shown\nin Fig. 1, where a complex gaussian modulation function\ng(k) =\n\n\u0012\n\na2\n8 \u03c03\n\n\u0013 41\n\n\u0014\n\na2 (k \u2212 k0 )2\nexp \u2212\n4\n\n\u0015\n\nexp[\u2212ik x0 ]\n\nhas been used. It is to be noted that the choice of including a phase factor in g(k) simply shifts all\ntimes by a constant m x0 /k0 at resonance. These figures display the wave function in the proximity\nof the barrier for suitably chosen times. One clearly sees in these figures the appearance of multiple\npeaks due to the two reflection points at x = 0 and x = l. This observation suggested the following\nanalysis and imposed the subsequent interpretation.\nThe R, A, B and T amplitudes may be rewritten as series expansions by considering multiple\nreflections and transmission in the potential discontinuity points,\nR=\nA=\nB=\nT =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nRn\nAn\nBn\nTn\n\n\u00132\n\u0015 \u22121\nk\u2212q\nexp[2 iql ]\n,\n= R1 + R2 1 \u2212\nk+q\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0015 \u22121\nk\u2212q\n= A1 1 \u2212\nexp[2 iql ]\n,\nk+q\n\u00132\n\u0015 \u22121\n\u0014\n\u0012\nk\u2212q\nexp[2 iql ]\n,\n= B1 1 \u2212\nk+q\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0015 \u22121\nk\u2212q\nexp[2 iql ]\n= T1 1 \u2212\n,\nk+q\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n(17)\n\n\fAlex E.

In this form the interpretation is easy. R1\nrepresents the first reflected wave (it has no time delay since it is real). R2 represents the second\nreflected wave. As a consequence of continuity, it is the sum, in region II, of the first left-going wave\n(B1 ) and the second right-going amplitude (A2 ), i.e.,\nR2 = A2 + B1 \u2261\n\nq\nA1 B1 .\nk\n\nThis structure is that given by considering two \"step functions\" back-to-back. Thus at each interface\nthe \"reflected\" and \"transmitted\" waves are instantaneous i.e. without any delay time. Indeed the\nSPM applied separately to each term in the above series expansion for R yields delay times which are\ninteger multiples of 2 (dq/dE)0 l = 2 (m/q0 )l. This agrees perfectly with the fact that since the peak\nmomentum in region II is q0 , the A and B waves have group velocities of q0 /m and hence transit times\n(one way) of (m/q0 )l. The first transmitted peak appears (according to this version of the SPM) after\na time (m/q0 )l, in perfect accord with the above interpretation.\nLet us re-express what is happening. The incoming wave peak reaches the first potential discontinuity at x = 0. It instantaneously yields a first reflected peak (R1 ) and right-moving (A1 ) peak in\nregion II. When this later wave packet reaches at time t = (m/q0 )l the second discontinuity at x = l,\na part T1 is transmitted into region III (x > l) while a part B1 is turned back and eventually gives\nrise to the second reflected peak and so forth. Is this compatible with probability conservation? It is\nbecause of the following identity\n\u221e\nX\n(|Rn |2 + |Tn |2 ) = 1 .\n(19)\nn=1\n\nThis result is by no means obvious since it coexists with the well known result, from the plane wave\nanalysis,\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n|R|2 + |T |2 = |\nRn |2 + |\nT n |2 = 1 .\n(20)\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nIn Fig. 2 we have re-plotted for various times the numerical calculations displayed in Fig. 1 and also the\nseparate integral calculations based upon the above multiple pole model i.e. for particular Rn (Tn ). The\nlatter wave packets are represented by the curves. The former un-decomposed numerical calculations\nare plotted by various bullets. Agreement is excellent.\nIn conclusion, the results of the SPM depend critically upon the manipulation of the amplitude\nprior to the application of the method. A posteriori this seems obvious. If we consider an amplitude\nsay\nz(k; x, t) = |z| exp[i\u03b1]\nthe SPM will yield one peak position for each given time. If we write the identity\nz = z1 + z2 ,\nwhere z1 = z \u2212 w and z2 = w, and treat separately these terms, then the same approach will yield two\npeaks and so forth. The method is inherently ambiguous unless we know, by some other means, at\nleast the number of separate peaks involved. Our above barrier analysis is simply a particular example\nof this ambiguity, for which we have presented a simple resolution, based upon multiple reflections,\nconfirmed in detail by numerical calculations.\n\n\f6\n\nAlex E.
