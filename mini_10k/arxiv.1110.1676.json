It aims at recovering source signals from their mixtures without detailed\nknowledge of the mixing process. Applications of BSS include signal analysis and\nprocessing of speech, image, and biomedical signals, especially, signal extraction, enhancement, denoising, model reduction and classification problems [8]. The goal of\nthis paper is to study new BSS methods for nearly degenerate data arising from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The BSS problem is defined by the\nfollowing matrix model\nX = A S , with Aij \u2265 0 , Sij \u2265 0 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p , A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n , S \u2208 Rn\u00d7p . Rows of X represents the measured mixed\nsignals, rows of S are the source signals. The X, S are sampled functions of an\nacquisition variable which may be time, frequency, position, wavenumber, etc, depending on the underlying physical process. Hence there are p samples in the measurements. The objective of BSS is to solve for A and S given X. In the context of NMR spectroscopy, the mixing coefficients are not typically measured. This\nis where BSS techniques become useful. The problem is also known as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF [18]). Similar to factorizing a composite number\n(48 = 6 \u2217 8 = 8 \u2217 6 = 4 \u2217 12 = 12 \u2217 4 = 2 \u2217 24 = 24 \u2217 2 = 3 \u2217 16 = 16 \u2217 3), there are\npermutation and scaling ambiguities in solutions to BSS. For any permutation matrix\nP and invertible diagonal matrix \u039b, (AP \u039b, \u039b\u22121 P \u22121 S) is another pair equivalent to\nthe solution (A, S), since\nX = AS = (AP \u039b)(\u039b\u22121P \u22121 S).\n\n(1.2)\n\nVarious BSS methods have been proposed relying on priori knowledge of source\nsignals such as spatio-temporal decorrelation, statistical independence, sparseness,\nnonnegativity, etc, [7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 20, 21, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Recently there have\nbeen considerable interests for solving nonnegative BSS problems, which emerge in\ncomputer tomography, biomedical image processing, NMR spectroscopy [2, 3, 14, 17,\n18, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35]. This work is originated from analytic\nchemistry, in particular, NMR spectroscopy. Applications include identification of\norganic compounds, metabolic fingerprinting, disease diagnosis, and drug design. As\nchemical mixtures abound in human organs, for example, blood, urine, and metabolites in brain and muscles. Each compound has a unique spectral fingerprint defined\nby the number, intensity and locations of its NMR peaks. In drug design, structural\ninformation must be isolated from spectra that also contain the target molecule, side\nproducts, and impurities.\nThe different spectra come from Fourier transform of NMR measurement of absorbance of radio frequency radiation by receptive nuclear spins of the same mixture\nsample at different time segments when exposed to high magnetic fields. The NMR\nspectra are nonnegative. Besides, NMR spectra of different chemical compounds are\nusually not independent, especially as compounds (component molecules) have similar\nfunctional groups, the peaks overlap in the composite NMR spectra making it difficult\nto identify the compounds involved. ICA-type approaches recover independent source\n1\n\n\fsignals and thus are unable to separate NMR source spectra. New methods need to\nbe invented to handle this class of data. Recently nonnegative BSS has been attracted\nconsiderable attention in NMR spectroscopy [1, 17, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37].\nFor example, Naanaa and Nuzillard (NN) proposed a nonnegative BSS method in\n[25] based on a strict local sparseness assumption of the source signals. The NN assumption (NNA) requires the source signals to be strictly non-overlapping at some\nlocations of acquisition variable (e.g., frequency). In other words, each source signal must have a stand-alone peak where other sources are strictly zero there. Such a\nstrict sparseness condition leads to a dramatic mathematical simplification of a general\nnonnegative matrix factorization problem (1.1) which is non-convex. Geometrically\nspeaking, the problem of finding the mixing matrix A reduces to the identification\nof a minimal cone containing the columns of mixture matrix X. The latter can be\nachieved by linear programming. In fact, NN's sparseness assumption and the geometric construction of columns of A were known in the 1990's [2, 35] in the problem\nof blind hyper-spectral unmixing, where the same mathematical model (1.1) is used.\nThe analogue of NN's assumption is called pixel purity assumption [6]. The resulting\ngeometric (cone) method is the so called N-findr [35], and is now a benchmark in\nhyperspectral unmixing. NN's method can be viewed as an application of N-findr to\nNMR data. It is possible that measured NMR data may not strictly satisfy NN's\nsparseness conditions, which introduces spurious peaks in the results. Postprocessing\nmethods have been developed to address the resulting errors. Such a study has been\nperformed recently in case of (over)-determined mixtures [30] where it is found that\nlarger peaks in the signals are more reliable and can be used to minimize errors due\nto lack of strict sparseness.\nIn this paper, we consider how to separate the data if NN assumption is not satisfied. We are concerned with the regime where source signals do not have stand-alone\npeaks yet one source signal dominates others over certain intervals of acquisition variable. In other words, a dominant interval(s) condition (DI) is required for source\nsignals. This is a reasonable condition for many NMR spectra. For example, the DI\ncondition holds well in the NMR data which motivated us. The data is produced\nby the so-called DOSY (diffusion ordered spectroscopy) experiment where a physical\nsample of mixed chemical compounds in solvent (water) is prepared. DOSY tries to\ndistinguish the chemicals based on variation in their diffusion rates. However, DOSY\nfails to separate them if the compounds have similar chemical functional groups (i.e.,\nthey have similar diffusion rates). In this application, the diffusion rates of the chemicals serve as the mixing coefficients. This presents an additional mathematical challenge due to the near singularity of the mixing matrix. Separating these degenerate\ndata is intractable to the convex cone methods, thus we are prompted to develop new\napproaches. Examination the DI condition reveals a great deal about the geometry of\nthe mixtures. Actually, the scattered plot of columns of X must contain several clusters of points, and these clusters are centered at columns of A. Hence, the problem of\nfinding A boils down to the identification of the clusters, and it can be accomplished\nby data clustering, for example, K-means. Although the data clustering in general\nproduces a fairly good estimate of the mixing matrix, its output deviates from the\ntrue solution due to the presence of the noise, initial guess of the clustering algorithm,\nand so on. In the case of nearly singular mixing matrix, a small perturbation can\nlead to large errors in the source recovery (e.g., spurious peaks). To overcome this\n2\n\n\fdifficulty and improve robustness of the separation, we propose two different methods. One is to find a better estimation of mixing matrix by allowing a constrained\nperturbation to the clustering output, and it is achieved by a quadratic programming.\nThe intention is to move the estimation closer to the true solution. The other is to\nseek sparse source signals by exploiting the DI condition. An l1 optimization problem\nis formulated for recovering the source signals.\nThe paper is outlined as follows; In section 2, we shall review the essentials of\nNN approach, then we propose a new condition on the source signals motivated by\nNMR spectroscopy data. In section 3, we introduce the method. In section 4, we\nfurther illustrate our method with numerical examples including the processing of\nan experimental DOSY NMR data set. Section 5 is the conclusion. We shall use the\nfollowing notations throughout the paper. The notation Aj stands for the j-th column\nof matrix A, S j for the j-th column of matrix S, X j the j-th column of matrix X.\nWhile Sj and Xj are the j-th rows of matrix S and X, or the j-th source and mixture,\nrespectively.\nThis work was partially supported by NSF-ADT grant DMS-0911277 and NSF\ngrant DMS-0712881. The authors thank Professor A.J. Shaka and Dr. Hasan Celik\nfor helpful discussions and their experimental NMR data.\n\n2\n\nThe method\n\nIn the paper, we shall consider the determined case (m = n), although the results can\nbe easily extended to the over-determined case (m > n). Consider the linear model\n(1.1) where each column in X represents data collected at a particular value of the\nacquisition variable, and each row represents a mixture spectrum. In this section, we\nshall first discuss the briefs of NN method, then introduce the new source conditions\nand the method.\n\n2.1\n\nNN approach\n\nIn [25], Naanaa and Nuzillard (NN) presented an efficient sparse BSS method and its\nmathematical analysis for nonnegative and partially orthogonal signals such as NMR\nspectra. Consider the (over)-determined regime where the number of mixtures is no\nless than that of sources (m \u2265 n), and the mixing matrix A is full rank. In simple\nterms, NN's key sparseness assumption (referred to as NNA below) on source signals\nis that each source has a stand-alone peak at some location of the acquisition variable\nwhere the other sources are identically zero. More precisely, the source matrix S \u2265 0\nis assumed to satisfy the following condition\nAssumption (NNA). : For each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} there exists an ji \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p}\nsuch that si,ji > 0 and sk,ji = 0 (k = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1, i + 1, . . . , n) .\nEq. (1.1) can be rewritten in terms of columns as\nXj =\n\nn\nX\n\nsk,j Ak j = 1, . . . , p ,\n\nk=1\n\n3\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fwhere X j denote the jth column of X, and Ak the kth column of A. Assumption\n1\nX ji . Hence Eq. (2.1) is\nNNA implies that X ji = si,ji Ai i = 1, . . . , n or Ai = si,j\ni\nrewritten as\nn\nX\nsi,j ji\nj\nX ,\n(2.2)\nX =\ns\ni=1 i,ji\nwhich says that every column of X is a nonnegative linear combination of the columns\nof \u00c2. Here \u00c2 = [X j1 , . . . , X jn ] is the submatrix of X consisting of n columns each of\nwhich is collinear to a particular column of A. It should be noted that ji (i = 1, . . . , n)\nare not known and have to be computed. Once all the ji s are found, an estimation\nof the mixing matrix is obtained. The identification of \u00c2\u2032 s columns is equivalent to\nidentifying a convex cone of a finite collection of vectors. The cone encloses the data\ncolumns in matrix X, and is the smallest of such cones. Such a minimal enclosing\nconvex cone can be found by linear programming methods. Mathematically, the\nfollowing constrained equations are formulated for the identification of \u00c2,\np\nX\n\nX j \u03bbj = X k , \u03bbj \u2265 0 k = 1, . . . , p .\n\n(2.3)\n\nj=1,j6=k\n\nThen any column X k will be a column of \u00c2 if and only if the constrained equation (2.3)\nis inconsistent. However, if noises are present, the following optimization problems\nare suggested to estimate the mixing matrix\nminimize score = k\n\np\nX\n\nX j \u03bbj \u2212 X k k2 , k = 1, . . . , p\n\nj=1,j6=k\n\nsubject to \u03bbj \u2265 0 .\nA score is associated with each column. A column with a low score is unlikely to be\na column of \u00c2 because this column is roughly a nonnegative linear combination of the\nother columns of X. On the other hand, a high score means that the corresponding\ncolumn is far from being a nonnegative linear combination of other columns. Practically, the n columns from X with highest scores are selected to form \u00c2, the mixing\nmatrix. The Moore-Penrose inverse \u00c2+ of \u00c2 is then computed and an estimate to S\nis obtained: \u015c = \u00c2+ X. NN method proves to be both accurate and efficient if NNA\ncondition holds. However, if the condition is not satisfied, errors and artifacts may be\nintroduced because the true mixing matrix is no longer the smallest enclosing convex\ncone of columns of the data matrix.\nRecently, the authors have developed postprocessing techniques on how to improve\nNN results with abundance of mixture data, and how to improve mixing matrix estimation with major peak based corrections [30]. The work in [30] actually considered\na relaxed NNA (rNNA) condition\nAssumption (rNNA). : For each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} there exists an ji \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p}\nsuch that si,ji > 0 and sk,ji = \u01ebk (k = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1, i + 1, . . . , n) , where \u01ebk \u226a si,ji .\nSimply said, each source signal has a dominant peak at acquisition position where\nthe other sources are allowed to be nonzero. NNA condition recovers if all \u01ebk = 0.\nThe rNNA is more realistic and robust than the ideal NNA for real-world NMR data\n[25].\n4\n\n\f5\nS\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nS\n\n4.5\n\n2\n\n0.49\n\nS3\n4\n\n0.48\n\n3.5\n\n0.47\n\n3\n\n0.46\n0.45\n\n2.5\n0.44\n2\n0.43\n1.5\n\n0.42\n\n1\n\n0.41\n0.3345\n\n0.5\n\n0.334\n0.3335\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n0.333\n\n1000\n\n0.16\n\n0.17\n\n0.18\n\n0.19\n\n0.2\n\n0.21\n\n0.22\n\n0.23\n\n0.24\n\nFigure 1: three source signals with dominant intervals (left panel); the geometry of\nthe mixture matrix (right panel). The centers (red diamond) of three clusters are\ndetected by k-means.\n\n2.2\n\nSource assumption and mixing matrix\n\nMotivated by the DOSY NMR spectra, we propose here a different relaxed NN condition on the source signals. Note that the rows S1 , S2 , . . . , Sn of S are the source signals,\nand they are required to satisfy the following condition: For i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n, source\nsignal Si is required to have dominant interval(s) over Sn , . . . , Si+1 , Si\u22121 , . . . , S2 , S1 ,\nwhile Si is allowed to overlap with other signals at the rest of the acquisition region.\nMore formally, it implies that source matrix S satisfies the following condition\nAssumption. For each k \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, there is a set Ik \u2282 {1, 2, . . . , p} such that\nfor each l \u2208 Ik skl \u226b sjl , j = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1, k + 1, . . . , n.\nWe shall call this dominant interval condition, or DI condition. Fig. 1 is an\nidealized example of three DI source signals. In addition to the DI source condition,\nthe mixing matrix is required to be near singular. The motivation is the similar\ndiffusion rates of the chemicals with similar structure. This poses a mathematical\nchallenge to invert a near singular matrix, since a small error in the recovered mixing\nmatrix might lead to a considerable deviation in the source recovery. Among the\nsingularly mixed signals (or degenerate data), in this paper we shall consider the\nfollowing two types: 1) columns of the mixing matrix are parallel; 2) one column of the\nmixing matrix is a nonnegative linear combination of others. Case 1 is motivated by\nNMR of the chemicals with similar diffusion rate. We shall call this condition parallel\ncolumn condition, or PCC. Case 2 can also be encountered in NMR spectroscopy of\nchemicals, and we shall call it one column degenerate condition, or OCDC. Please note\nthat both PCC and OCDC should be considered to hold approximately in real-world\ndata.\n\n5\n\n0.25\n\n\f2.3\n\nOur approach\n\n2.3.1\n\nData clustering\n\nNow suppose we have a set of nearly degenerate signals from DI sources. We require\nthat compared to the size of dominant interval(s) in the acquisition region, the source\nsignals overlapping region is much smaller. In fact, this is a reasonable assumption\nfor the NMR data which motivates us. More importantly, this requirement enables\nthe success of the clustering method. Next, we shall estimate the columns of mixing\nmatrix A by data clustering. The dominant interval(s) from each of the source signals\nimplies that there is a region where the source Si dominates others. More precisely,\nthere are columns of X such that\nk\n\ni\n\nX = si,k A +\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\noj,k Aj ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere si,k dominate oi,k (i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1), i.e., si,k \u226b oi,k . The identification of Ai (i =\n1, . . . , n) is equivalent to finding a cluster formed by these X k 's in Rn . As illustrated\nin the geometry plot of X in Fig. 1, three clusters are formed. Many clustering\ntechniques are available for locating these clusters, for example, k-means is one of\nthe simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering\nproblem. We shall use k-means analysis in this paper because it is computationally\nfast, and easy to implement. Consider an example of three DI source signals with\nOCDC mixing matrix condition, the three centers are shown in Fig. 1. For real-world\ndata, we show an example of NMR spectra of quinine, geraniol, and camphor mixture\nin Fig. 2. The clusters in the middle implies that OCDC condition hold well for\nthis data. Apparently, NN method (and other convex cone methods) would fail to\nseparate the source signals due to the degeneracy of the mixing matrix. It might be\nable to identify two columns of A as the two edges, it by no means can locate A's\ndegenerate column. For the PCC degenerate case, clustering is also able to deliver a\ngood estimation, even when the data is contaminated by noise. We show the results\nin Fig. 3 where the three clusters are very close due to the PCC degeneracy. NN\nsolution would deviate considerably from the true solution. For the data we tested,\nclustering techniques like k-means works well when the condition number of the mixing\nmatrix is up to 108 . Though the solutions of mixing matrix by clustering methods are\nrather good estimation to the true solution, small deviations from the true ones will\nintroduce large errors in the source recovery (S = inverse(A) X). Next we propose two\napproaches to overcome this difficulty. Both approaches need to solve optimization\nproblems. The first one intends to improve the source recovery by seeking a better\nmixing matrix, while the second approach reduces the spurious peaks by imposing\nsparsity constraint on the sources.\n2.3.2\n\nBetter inverse of the mixing matrix\n\nSuppose the estimation of the mixing matrix by clustering is \u00c2. Then the source\nrecovery can be obtained \u015c = inverse(\u00c2) X. As discussed above, errors in \u015c could be\nintroduced even by a small perturbation in \u00c2 to the ground truth. Negative spurious\npeaks are produced in most cases, see the Fig. 5 where the negative peaks on the left\n6\n\n\f4\n\n4\n0.25\n\nx 10\n\n2\n\n0.24\n\n0\n10\n0.23\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n0.22\n\nx 10\n\n4\n2\n\n0.21\n\n0\n10\n0.2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nx 10\n\n0.19\n\n2\n0.18\n0.385\n\n0.39 0.395\n\n0.4 0.405\n\n0.41 0.415\n0.42 0.425\n0.43 0.435\n\n0.395\n\n0.39\n\n0.385\n\n0.38\n\n0.375\n\n0.37\n\n0.365\n\n0.36\n\n1\n0\n10\n\nppm\n\nFigure 2: Real data example: three columns of A are identified as the three center\npoints (in red diamond) attracting most points in scatter plots of the columns of X\n(left), and the three rows of X (right).

Clearly, a better\nestimation of mixing matrix is required to reduce these spurious peaks. Instead of\nlooking for a better mixing matrix, we propose to solve the following optimization\nproblem for a better inverse of the matrix,\n1\nmin kI \u2212 \u00c2Bk22\nB 2\n\nsubject to B X \u2265 0 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere I \u2208 Rm\u00d7m is the identity matrix. The constraint B X \u2265 0 is used to reduce\nthe negative values introduced in the source recovery. (2.5) is a linearly constrained\nquadratic program and it can be solved by a variety of methods including interior\npoint, gradient projection, active sets, etc. In this paper, interior point algorithm is\nused. Once the minimizer B \u2217 is obtained, we solve for the sources by S = B \u2217 X.\n2.3.3\n\nSparser source signals\n\nThe method proposed above works well for mixing matrix whose condition number\nis up to 108 . If the mixing matrix is much more ill-conditioned, the problem (1.1)\nbecomes under-determined. It appears that solving the equation exactly for S is\nhopeless even an accurate A is provided. However, a meaningful solution is possible if\nthe actual source signals are structurally compressible, meaning that they essentially\ndepend on a low number of degrees of freedom. Although the source signals (rows of\nS) are not sparse, the columns of S possess sparsity due to the dominant intervals\ncondition. Hence, we seek the sparsest solution for each column S i of S as\nmin kS i k0\n\nsubject to \u00c2S i = X i , S i \u2265 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere k*k0 ( 0-norm ) represents the number of nonzeros. Because of the non-convexity\nof the 0-norm, we minimize the l1 -norm:\nmin kS i k1\n\nsubject to AS i = X i , S i \u2265 0,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhich is a linear program [11] because S i is non-negative. The fact that data may in\ngeneral contain noise suggest solving the following unconstrained optimization problem,\n1 i\ni\ni 2\nmin\n\u03bckS\nk\n(2.8)\n1 + kX \u2212 AS k2 ,\nS i \u22650\n2\nfor which Bregman iterative method [15, 38] with a proper projection onto nonnegative convex subset can be used to obtain a solution. Under certain conditions of\nmatrix A, it is known [5, 39] that solution of l1 -minimization (2.8) gives the exact recovery of sufficiently sparse signal, or solution to (2.6), [5, 39]. Though our numerical\nresults support the equivalence of l1 and l0 minimizations, the mixing matrix A does\nnot satisfy the existing sufficient conditions [5, 39].\n\n3\n\nNumerical experiments\n\nIn this section, we report the numerical examples solved by the method. We compute\nthree examples. The data of the first two examples are synthetic, while the third\n8\n\n\fexample uses real NMR data. In the first example, two sources are to be separated\nfrom two mixtures. The mixtures are constructed from two real NMR source signal\nby simulating the linear model (1.1). The two columns of mixing matrix are nearly\nparallel, and its condition number is about 1.25 \u00d7 108 . The true mixing matrix A, its\nestimation \u00c2 via clustering, and the improved estimate Ap by solving (2.5) are (for\nease of comparison, the first rows of \u00c2, Ap are scaled to be same as that of A)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0.894427190999916 0.894427182055644\n,\nA=\n0.447213595499958 0.447213613388501\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0.894427190999916 0.894427182055644\n,\n\u00c2 =\n0.447213596792237 0.447213596447341\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0.894427190999916\n0.894427182055644\nAp =\n.\n0.447213595582167 0.447213613388502\nClearly Ap is a better estimate. The mixtures are plotted in Fig. 4, and the results\nare presented in Fig. 5.\nIn the second example, three sources are to be separated from three mixtures. The\nmixing matrix satisfies the OCDC condition, i.e., one of its columns is a nonnegative\nlinear combination of the other two. To test the robustness of the method, we added\nGaussian noise (SNR = 60 dB) to the data. The mixtures and their geometric structure are plotted in Fig. 6. First the data clustering was used to obtain an estimation\nof the mixing matrix, then an l1 optimization problem is solved to retrieve the sources.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the recovered sources agree well\nwith the ground truth.\nFor the third example, we provide a set of real data to test our method. The\ndata is produced by diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) which is an NMR spectroscopy technique used by chemists for mixture separation [22]. However, the three\ncompounds used in the experiment (quinine, geraniol, and camphor) have similar\nchemical functional groups (i.e. there is overlapping in their NMR spectra) [24], for\nwhich DOSY fails to separate them. It is known that each of the three sources has\ndominant interval(s) over others in its NMR spectrum. This can also be verified from\nthe three isolated clusters formed in their mixed NMR spectra (see the geometry of\ntheir mixtures in Fig. 8). Here we separate three sources from three mixtures. Fig.\n8 plots the mixtures (rows of X) and their geometry (columns of X) where three\nclusters of points can be spotted. Then the columns of A are identified as the center points of three clusters. The solutions are presented in Fig. 9, the results are\nsatisfactory comparing with the ground truth. As a comparison, the source signals\nrecovered by NN [25] is shown in Fig. 10 where S = inverse(A) X, here the inverse is\nMoore-Penrose (the least squares sense) pseudo-inverse which produces some negative\n(erroneous) peaks in S.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper presented novel methods to retrieve source signals from the nearly degenerate mixtures. The motivation comes from NMR spectroscopy of chemical compounds\nwith similar diffusion rates.

This condition is well suited for many real-life signals. Besides, the nearly degenerate mixtures are assumed to be generated from the following\ntwo types of mixing processes: 1) all the columns of the mixing matrix are parallel; 2) One column of the mixing matrix is the nonnegative linear combination of\nothers. We first use data clustering to identify the mixing matrix, then we develop\ntwo approaches to improve source signals' recovery. The first approach minimizes a\nconstrained quadratic program for a better mixing matrix, while the second method\nseeks the sparsest solution for each column of the source matrix by solving an l1 optimization. Numerical results on NMR spectra data show satisfactory performance of\nour method and offer promise towards understanding and detecting complex chemical\nspectra. Though the methods are motivated by the NMR spectroscopy, the underlying\nideas may be generalized to different data sets in other applications.\n\nReferences\n[1] R. Barton, J. Nicholson, P.
