These processes could either increase the neutron-finger instability or replace it in\nmodels that have no surface convection.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn most supernova models with pure spherical symmetry, after a massive star collapses due to the exhaustion of its nuclear fuel, the neutrino luminosity from the proto-neutron star (PNS) is too low to\nheat the in-falling material sufficiently to expel matter from the star (e.g. Bruenn 1985; 1993, Burrows,\nHayes, & Fryxell 1995; Yamada et al. 1999; Fryer &\nHeger 2000; Rampp & Janka 2000, 2002; Liebend\u00f6rfer\net al. 2001; Mezzacappa et al 2001; Akiyama et al.\n2003 Buras et al. 2003; Thompson, Burrows, & Pinto\n2003; Burrows 2004; Cardall 2004). However, the Livermore supernova model (cf. Wilson & Mayle 1988;\n1993; Wilson & Mathews 2003) avoids this problem\nand is able to explode in spherical symmetry by inducing a larger amount of neutrino heating soon after the\ncore bounce. For this reason it is important to examine any possible means to induce additional heating\nabove the proto-neutron star.\nOne important mechanism for such heating, for example, is that the proto-neutron star can become hydrodynamically unstable a few hundred milliseconds\nafter the core bounce due to the so-called neutronfinger instability (Wilson & Mayle 1988; Wilson &\nMathews 2003). This instability results from the\nbuild up of dense material with a large neutron-toproton ratio near the surface of the proto-neutron\nstar. Sufficiently neutron-rich material can overcome\nthe buoyancy caused by the high entropy near the surface. As surface material sinks downward neutrinorich material rises to the surface. This enhances the\nneutrino luminosity and produces enough heating of\nmaterial behind the shock to produce an explosion\n(cf. Wilson & Mathews 2003).\nThe fact that other models of Type II supernovae\ndo not exhibit this instability can be attributed to a\nnumber of possibilities (e.g. Bruenn et al. 2004) such\nas differences in the equation of state employed, the\ndetailed way in which convection is treated, and/or\nthe treatment of neutrino flow. Hence, this mechanism is controversial (Bruenn et al. 2004) as a means\nto induce core-collapse supernovae. THerefore, in this\npaper we describe first schematic calculations of some\nplausible, and perhaps more compelling, alternatives\nto the neutron-finger instability to overcome the lack\nof sufficient neutrino luminosity at early times in\nthe explosion. We have investigated two magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects both above and below\nthe rotating proto-star surface that may be strong\n\n2.\n\nModels\n\nThe purpose of the present paper is to make a\nschematic study of the possible roles of magnetohydrodynamics in rotating core-collapse supernovae.\nWhile the models we utilize are adequate to illustrate\nthe order of magnitude of these effects, we emphasize\nthat it will be necessary to do this calculation in two\nor three spatial dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics\n(MHD) to prove that the ideas presented here are correct. Such calculations, however, present an exceedingly difficult computational challenge. For the purposes of the present schematic investigation, however,\na much simpler model is employed which involves the\naverage spherical effects of the inherently multidimensional rotation and magnetic effects as a perturbation\non one-dimensional hydrodynamics. This is a reasonable approximation as a means of exploring the parameter space and extracting the essential physics as\nlong as we are considering moderate rotation rates\nand relatively weak but realistic magnetic fields.\nAs we shall see, the main effects in our perturbation analysis are build up of magnetic turbulence and\nfield energy above the proto-neutron star shortly after\ncollapse and bounce due to the accretion of magnetized matter, and the formation of magnetic bubbles\nand magnetic-driven convection below the surface of\nthe PNS. We demonstrate that both of these effects\ncan significantly impact the explosion mechanism.\n2.1.\n\nSupernova Model\n\nDetails of the current version of the Livermore\nsupernova model have been described in Wilson &\nMathews (2003). For completeness we here summarize the basic physics and the way in which the effects\nof rotation and MHD are implemented.

This resolution has been employed and tested\nin previous supernova collapse and rotating star calculations (Wilson & Mathews 2003) and should be\nadequate for the analysis here.\nThe initial MHD model assumes that the star is rotating with a uniform angular velocity in the inner 5\nM\u2299 of the star. It is also threaded by a uniform magnetic field in the direction of the axis of rotation before\nthe start of the dynamic core-collapse phase. Various\ninitial models have been explored. For most of the\nmodels reported on here, the strength of the initial\nmagnetic field is chosen such that the final neutron\nstar would have a surface magnetic field of H \u223c 1012\nG.\nThe initial rotational velocity in some models leads\nto a post collapse rotation period (P \u223c 1.4 ms). This\nis close to the shortest possible Keplerian neutronstar rotation period (P\u223c< 1 ms, Burgio, Schulze & Weber 2003), and is comparable to the minimum values\nin the observed period distribution for pulsars (Phinney & Kulkarni 1994; Weber 1999; Manchester 2004).\nObserved young pulsars (Manchester 2004) in supernova remnants have much longer periods (\u223c 1 s) than\nthat obtained in these calculations. However they also\nhave large spin down rates. Indeed, the stars modeled\nhere should also have a large spin-down rate. Since\nthe poloidal field threads the rapidly rotating neutron\nstar, and we use a massive outer envelope of very low\nangular velocity, a very high torque should develop\nbetween the spinning neutron star and the outer star\nplus magnetic field. These torques are sufficient to\nslow the neutron star down to well within the observed range by the time it becomes an observable\npulsar.\n\nMagnetic Fields\n\nMagnetic fields are easily added to the simulation\nvia the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor,\nFluid\nEM\nT\u03bc\u03bd = T\u03bc\u03bd\n+ T\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere,\nEM\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u03b1\u03b2\n(g\u03b1\u03bc F \u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b2\u03bd \u2212\nF F\u03b1\u03b2 ) ,\n4\u03c0\n4\n\n(17)\n\nand as usual, the electromagnetic tensor F\u03bc\u03bd can be\nrelated to a vector potential A\u03bd ,\nF\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u2202A\u03bd\n\u2202A\u03bc\n\u2212\n.\n\u03bc\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\u03bd\n\n(18)\n\nIn cylindrical symmetry the non-vanishing spatial\ncomponents of F\u03bc\u03bd are thus,\nFrz = H\u03c6\n\n,\n\nFr\u03c6 =\n\n\u2202A\u03c6\n\u2202r\n\n,\n\nFz\u03c6 =\n\n\u2202A\u03c6\n.

At\npost bounce times typically tpb \u223c 200 ms, the protoneutron star radius is \u223c 40 km and the shock radius\nis \u223c 170 km. Later, at tpb \u2248 300 ms, the protoneutron star radius is 32 km and the shock radius\nhas contracted to 140 km. The Mach number in the\nsub-shock region is < 0.1.\nIn the sub-shock region magnetic field generation is\npossible for a rapidly rotating magnetized collapsing\nstar. To model the evolution of the magnetic field,\n\nInitial Conditions\n\nTo evolve the matter equations of motion 6-15, we\nadopt 250 nonuniform radial zones. The grid extends\nto \u223c 170 zones above the photosphere. For the magnetic evolution we adopt 30 angular zones in a 90o\nquadrant so that the size of each angular zone is 3o .\nIn our calculations the region of magnetic-driven turbulence extends over a region of \u223c 10 \u2212 20 radial\n4\n\n\fThe thermal matter pressure PM (\u01eb, \u03c1) above the PNS\nis thus augmented by Eq. 28 through the increase in\n\u01ebmatter .\nIn addition, however, there are contributions from\nrotation and magnetic effects. In cylindrical coordinates the rotational energy density is just\n\nwe follow the general principles given in Balbus and\nHawley (1998) [hereafter BH98].\nThe work of BH98 has led us to examine the stability of the accretion flow of matter in the waist region shortly after core bounce. After bounce a shock\nmoves out above the proto-neutron star. This produces a region of slowly moving (Mach number < 0.1)\nmatter (see Figure 1). For an initially uniformly rotating iron core this subshock region has an angular\nvelocity profile of \u03c9 \u221d r\u22121.8 . While this velocity profile is different from the Keplerian profile (\u03c9 \u221d r\u22123/2 )\nstudied in BH98, it is still unstable to magnetohydrodynamic flow. BH98 give a maximum growth rate of\n\u03bb = (r/2)(d\u03c9/dr) \u2248 0.9\u03c9. We adopt this growth rate.\nHence we write: \u1e22 = \u03bbH,\nBH98 treat accretion disks that are almost static\nand orbital velocities that are close to Keplerian.\nHowever, in our supernova model the accretion is\nrapid and the angular velocity is not Keplerian.\nWe assume that the turbulent magnetic field amplitude then grows as\nH\u0303(t) = H0 (r)eI ,\nwhere I is the integrated growth rate\nZ\nZ\nZ rsh\n\u03c9\ndr ,\nI = \u03bbdt = 0.9 \u03c9dt = 0.9\nv\nr\n\nErot =\n\nProt =\n\nErot\n1\n= \u03c1\u03c9 2 r2 .\n3\n6\n\n(30)\n\nSimilarly, the energy density due to the isotropic\nturbulent magnetic field H\u0303 is\n\u1ebcmag =\n\nH\u0303 2\n,\n8\u03c0\n\n(31)\n\nThe average pressure is then a third of this as is usual\nfor an isotropic massless field. However, we then reduce this by another factor of two due to the solid\nangle of the directional flow of the accreting material.\nHence we write\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\nProt =\n\nH\u0303 2\n.\n48\u03c0\n\n(32)\n\nCalculations were made with different initial angular velocities to find out how much rotation was\nneeded to result in an explosion. These conditions\nare summarized in Table 1.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effects on a rotating collapse simulation with and without effects of the magnetic turbulent pressure contribution. For this example, the rejuvenation of the shock due to magnetic\nfield amplification above the PNS is clearly demonstrated.\n2.6.\n\nMagnetic Bubble Driven Explosion below the PNS Surface\n\nThe nonhomologous collapse of a uniformly rotating iron core leads to differential rotation and the\nbuild up of a toroidial magnetic field (see Wheeler,\nMeier & Wilson 2002 for a general discussion and references). The toroidial field builds up to large values\nand produces a region unstable to magnetic buoyancy\nand tension as we now describe.\n\n(27)\n\nEnergy is deposited in matter after the field surpasses the Hmax . Hence, after H\u0303 = Hmax we let,\n2\n\u01eb\u0307matter = 2\u03c9Hmax\n/8\u03c0\u03c1 .\n\n(29)\n\nWe note that r = R sin (\u03b8) and deduce an effective\nisotropic pressure due to rotational energy from an\nangular average of the rotational energy,\n\nwhere rsh is the shock radius.\nIn the above, H0 is the ordered HZ , HR , and H\u03a6\nthat arises from the spherical inflow of the magnetized\nmatter. The transition to a turbulent magnetic field\nis assumed to be rapid on the problem time scale.\nFor the lowest initial angular velocity that produced\nan explosion, \u03c9 = 0.071 s\u22121 , the integrated growth\nrate was I \u2248 30 at a post bounce time of tpb = 0.14 s\nand increased to I \u2248 90 by tpb = 0.25 s.\nThe initial field was selected so that the final neutron star field will be \u2248 1012 Gauss. The ordered field\nis thus take to be H0 = 1012 (10 km/r)2 Gauss. As\ndemonstrated in BH98, the field is assumed to grow\nuntil near equipartition,\n2\n\u03c9 2 r2\nHmax\n\u2261\n.\n8\u03c0\u03c1\n4\n\n1 2 2\n\u03c1\u03c9 R .\n2\n\n(28)\n5\n\n\fTable 1\nExplosion times and angular velocities\n\u03c90 ( s\u22121 )\n0.20\n0.10\n0.0707\n0.05\n\n200\n250\n340\n\u221e\n\nThe magnetic bubble model assumes that the magnetic fields evolve in matter which can be treated as\nhaving perfect conductivity. Also, the magnetic braking back reaction of the field on the fluid is not explicitly included, though we estimate its effect. We start\nwith the 18 M\u2299 stellar progenitor model of Woosley &\nWeaver (1985) at the time at which the iron core has\njust become unstable to infall. While the hydrodynamics is assumed to evolve spherically, the magnetic\nfield is assumed to be axially symmetric and is evolved\nin cylindrical coordinates. In what follows, therefore,\nwe will need to simultaneously consider quantities in\nboth cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Hence, we\nuse capital R, Z, \u03a6 to distinguish cylindrical coordinates, while r, \u03b8, and \u03a6 are used to denote for spherical coordinates. We assign all the matter with an\nangular rotational velocity \u03c90 about the Z axis. A\nuniform magnetic field in the Z direction is assumed.\nEach mass shell is then zoned in the \u03b8 direction for\nthe calculation of the magnetic fields and rotational\nmotion.\nThe magnetic flux in the Z direction is taken as\nconstant in \u03a6 for each (r, \u03b8) zone. Each mass shell\nrotates rigidly and preserves its angular momentum.\nAs described in Section 3, these assumptions lead to\nthe following equation for the evolution of the the\ntoroidal field.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00134\ndr0 r\nr0\nsin (\u03b8) cos (\u03b8)\n\u22121\n\u1e22\u03a6 = HZ0 \u03c90\nr\ndr r0\nH\u03a6 \u2202(rv)\n\u2212\n.\n(33)\nr \u2202r\n\n1000\n\nRadius (km)\n\n800\n\n600\n\nRSH (Mag.)\n\n400\n\n200\n\nRSH (No Mag.)\nRNS\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\ntpb ms\n\n0.4\n\ntpb(sec)\n\nFig. 1.- The lowest curve shows the radius of the\nproto-neutron star as a function of time post bounce.\nThe upper curves give the radius of the accretion\nshock for models with an initial angular velocity of\n\u03c9 = 0.071 s\u22121 with and without magnetic turbulence as labeled. The upper curve clearly shows the\neffects of magnetic field amplification on the shock\nfront. The lower curve shows that rotation alone has\nlittle effect for this particular model.\n\nNote, that the sin (\u03b8) cos (\u03b8) product implies a maximum rate of field growth in a region inclined 45o from\nthe rotation axis.\n6\n\n\fkm s\u22121 . If these stars rotate uniformly, then unless\nsignificant angular momentum transfer occurs during\ncollapse, they would form a neutron star near the\nmaximum rotation rate.\nWe also point out, that lower spins are required\nif a higher initial magnetic field is adopted. For example, a calculation was made with a smaller initial\nrotation rate of 0.1 rad s\u22121 and a higher precollapse\nmagnetic field of 108 G. The final magnetic field was\ncorrespondingly higher (3\u00d71012 G). A good explosion\nresulted and the final neutron star period increased\nto a few ms. With this scaling a final field of 1013 G\nonly requires an initial rotation rate of 0.03 s\u22121 . Field\nstrengths of \u223c 1013 are comparable to that observed\nin a large number of pulsars (Manchester 2004), e.g\nthe Crab pulsar for which H \u2248 8 \u00d7 1012 Gauss. Indeed, it is by now well established that magnetars\nwith fields as high as 1015 G exists. Such stars would\nrequire only rather small rotation rates to induce a\nsupernova.\nAs the inner core of the star collapses in our benchmark model, the rotation and magnetic fields cause\nthe collapse to become very non-homologous. Density\nin the inner region quickly rises from \u03c1 \u2248\u223c 4 \u00d7 109\nto a bounce density of \u223c 5 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 . Above a\nbaryonic mass cut of about 1.5 M\u2299 the density rises\nvery slowly. This leads to large values of r0 /r and\n(dr0 /dr)(r/r0 ). Hence, a large H\u03a6 field is developed\naccording to Eq. (33). The componendt HR and\nHZ rise as well but not nearly as much as H\u03a6 . The\nazimuthal H\u03a6 component thus becomes the dominant\nfield component in the proto-neutron star.\nA key result from these simulations is that the principle field energy density, H\u03a62 /8\u03c0, forms two concentrated toroidal shaped regions at about 45o from the\nrotation axis. Figure 2 compares the magnetic tension\nH 2 /4\u03c0 with the matter pressure along a 45o radius.\nThe buoyancy of and tension of these toroidal regions\nwill stir the matter and induce the transport of matter and neutrinos from the core to the surface. We\nhere endeavor to provide an estimate of the effects of\nthis transport on the explosion.\nThe motion of material due to these combined effects of rotation, magnetic buoyancy and magnetic\ntension is exceedingly complex and would require a\nfully three dimensional MHD code. Nevertheless, the\nessential features of this magnetic convection can be\ndeduced via a a diffusion algorithm which obeys all\nrelevant conservation laws as it transports matter, radiation, and neutrino properties. The same algorithm\n\nThe poloidal field components then follow from flux\nconservation,\n\u1e22Z = HZ0\n\n\u0012\n\nr0\nr\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\ndr0 r\nsin2 (\u03b8)\n+ cos2 (\u03b8) .

The quantity, HZ0 , is\nthe initial uniform magnetic field and \u03c90 is the initial\nangular velocity.\nThe initial angular rotational velocity was chosen\nto be large enough that a toroidal field will build up\nto a size such that the buoyancy will be large enough\nto over come the stabilizing outward increasing entropy gradient of the matter. Such buoyancy will\nthen cause matter to turnover by the quasi-Ledoux\nconvection (Wilson & Mayle 1993; Wilson & Mathews 2003). This turnover then brings \u03bd-rich material\nto the surface. This enhances the neutrino luminosity\nenough at early times to achieve a successful explosion.\n3.\n\nResults\n\nHere, we present results for a plausible model in\nwhich the initial precollapse magnetic field, HZ , was\nchosen to be 3.16 \u00d7 107 G. This field magnitude was\nchosen because it was estimated that the resulting\nneutron star would have a magnetic field of the order of 1012 G. Several initial angular velocities were\ntried in order to find the minimum amount of rotation required to produce an explosion. The minimum\nangular velocity was found to be 0.3 rad s\u22121 for this\nmagnetic field strength.\nThis angular velocity is rather high. Nevertheless\npreliminary axially-symmetric hydrodynamics calculations (Tipton 2004) of the collapse of a star with\n\u03c9 = 0.3 s\u22121 have found only a small distortion from\nsphericity for the first 0.2 s after bounce, though a\nvortex would form unless viscosity was included.\nAs noted above, this angular velocity leads to a\nrotation rate than is comparable to the shortest observed period pulsars and is near the maximum Keplerian limit on neutron-star spin and is somewhat\nlarger than the rotation rate observed in young pulsars (Manchester 2004). Nevertheless, massive stars\nare known (e.g. Penny, Sprague & Seago 2004) to\nhave high surface rotation velocities, typically \u223c 200\n7\n\n\fas has been employed for neutron-finger convection in\nthe Livermore supernova model (Wilson & Mathews\n2003). This allows an easy comparison with results\nfrom that mechanism.\nThe effect of the magnetic buoyancy and tension\ninstability is therefore modeled as follows. When the\nbuoyancy of the magnetic field is sufficient to overcome the positive entropy gradient then a magnetic\ndiffusion algorithm is initiated.\nThe problem of how the magnetic bubbles will rise\nand exchange energy, etc., with its surroundings is\nquite difficult to solve directly. To model the effect we\nuse the existing convection algorithm in the supernova\nmodels to transport energy, composition, and neutrinos. Dimensional analysis is used to set the size of\nan effective diffusion coefficient, i.e. the effective diffusion coefficient is taken as scaling with the product\nof a mixing length times the characteristic magnetic\nvelocity parameter.\ns\nl\nH2\n,\n(36)\nD=\n30 8\u03c0\u03c1\n\n20\nMagnetic Tension\nMatter Pressure\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10\nr (km)\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nwhere H is the maximum of the magnitude of the H\u03a6\nfield and\n\n18\n\nl\n\n= r\u03bd \u2212 r , r < rH\n= r\u03bd \u2212 rH , r \u2265 rH ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere rH is the radius at which the maximum of H\noccurs, and r\u03bd is the radius of the neutrino photosphere. The factor of 30 in the denominator was deliberately assumed to be large so as to be conservative\nin our estimate of the size and behavior of the magnetic convective cells. A smaller cell size implies a\nslower convective lifetime. It should be noted that\nour calculation is only good enough to show the scale\nof rotation and magnetic field that can initiate an explosion.\nAs in the case of the neutron-finger instability\n(Wilson & Mathews 2003), the magnetic convection\nbrings up proton-rich matter (compared to the deleptonized surface regions) as well as neutrinos towards\nthe surface of the proto-neutron star and results in an\nenhanced neutrino luminosity soon after bounce.\nFigures 3-6 show some of the details of the calculation with an initial field of 3.16 \u00d7 107 G and a\nrotation rate of 0.3 rad s\u22121 . In Figures 7-9 these are\ncompared to calculations with no convection and also\nthose with neutron finger convection.

Here it is apparent from the expanding radii and increasing entropies that a good explosion has resulted. When the entropy rises to about\n80 the heating by neutrino-electron scattering is equal\nto that of neutrino capture. Hence, even though the\nluminosities are falling the heating within the highentropy bubble will remain substantial.\nFigure 7 compares the electron neutrino luminosities as functions of time for three runs: no convection, neutron-finger convection, and magnetic-field\ndriven convection.

If correct, this may provide the long sought after insight as to how corecollapse supernovae become sufficiently heated behind\nthe shock to explode. An interesting possible side\neffect of the magnetic field generation that we studied is that an axial jet and/or a prolate bulge in the\nmass distribution should arise independently of how\nthe convection is driven. Such features, for example,\nmight be an explanation of the observation that most\nremnants emit polarized optical radiation.\nIt should be noted that both this magnetic turbulence effect and the magnetic bubble formation below\nthe proto-neutron star surface will act together with\nneutron-fingers to induce an explosion. Clearly, more\ndetailed work utilizing two and three dimensional\nMHD simulations is required to explore whether the\nmagnetic buoyancy effect described herein is sufficient to induce an explosion. This is, however, a difficult and time-consuming calculation. It is hoped\nthe present work will stimulate further effort to understand this possibly important contribution to the\ncomplex paradigm of core-collapse supernovae.\n\nBalbus, S. A. & Hawley, J.
