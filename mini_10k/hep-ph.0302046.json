J.\nJanuary 2003\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the most important goals in the scientific program of a future linear electron\u2013\npositron collider (LC) is to measure the properties of the Higgs boson precisely. Among\nthem, the parity plays a prominent role. Depending on the mass and the Higgs mechanism,\nthe Higgs parity can be measured by different means [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In some cases, it can be\nbest determined by investigating the properties of the Higgs boson decay into \u03c4 leptons [6,\n7]. In [8] we studied the possibility of distinguishing a scalar from a pseudoscalar coupling\nof a light boson to fermions using its decay to a pair of \u03c4 leptons and their subsequent\ndecays \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 (\u03bd\u03c4 ) and \u03c1\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 . This decay chain gives an independent test of\nmodel and production mechanism. In fact, we have found that the angular distributions of\nthe \u03c4 \u00b1 decay products, which clearly distinguish the different parity states, are measurable\nusing typical properties of a future detector at an e+ e\u2212 linear collider. A special Monte\nCarlo technique was developed for that purpose [9]. In the present paper we will extend\nthat analysis, using the information that can be obtained from the measurement of the \u03c4\nlepton impact parameter.\nIt turns out that the kinematic configuration of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events cannot be fully\ndetermined since the momenta of both \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 are unknown. The lost information can\nbe recovered partially by measuring energy and directions of all visible particles [10, 11].\nWhen both \u03c4 leptons decay hadronically and all hadron momenta are recovered, the\noriginal \u03c4 direction can be obtained up to a twofold ambiguity [10, 12]. In the method,\nthe requirement that the two \u03c4 leptons be essentially of equal energy and back to back\nin some known frame, is decisive. The measurement of the tracks of the hadrons, in\nparticular their relative impact parameters, allows us to resolve this twofold ambiguity,\nsee for instance [10, 11, 13].\nIn the case of linear colliders such as TESLA [14], a sufficiently precise reconstruction\nof the frame, where \u03c4 leptons are expected to be back to back turns out to be impossible,\nmainly due to beamstrahlung effect. This is a strong limitation for the Higgs boson parity\nmeasurement as proposed in Refs. [6,7]. A way around was found in Ref. [8]. Here, we will\ninvestigate if the measurement of the \u03c4 lepton impact parameter direction, with precision\nas expected for TESLA, can be used to optimize that method.\nThis work is organized as follows: in section 2 the geometry of \u03c4 production and decay\nis described, as well as our way to use the \u03c4 impact parameter in the measurement of the\nHiggs boson parity. In section 3 some details of the TAUOLA Monte Carlo simulation are\ngiven. Section 4 is devoted to the definitions used in our simulation of detector properties.\nIn section 5 definitions of our observable and numerical results are given. The summary,\nsection 6, closes the paper.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDescription of the method\n\nIn the decay of the \u03c4 lepton into one charged particle, the \u03c4 impact parameter can be\ndefined as the distance of closest approach (in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis)\nof the charged particle to a reference point, which is assumed to be the production point\nof the \u03c4 (see Fig. 1). A positive sign is given to this quantity if the track crosses the\n\u03c4 direction in the same hemisphere, relative to the \u03c4 production point, in which it lays,\nand negative otherwise. The production point is assumed to lie on the beam line. In our\nstudy we will exploit the possibility to determine the direction of the impact parameter,\nrather than the related distance. In fact we will be interested, where the \u03c4 production\npoint is localized with respect to the charged pion track.\nBefore we address the question of the information available from the impact parameter,\nlet us recall some details of the actual observable proposed in Ref. [8] for the Higgs boson\nparity measurement. The method relies on measuring the acoplanarity angle of the two\nplanes, spanned on \u03c1\u00b1 decay products and defined in the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair rest frame; some\nadditional selection cuts also need to be applied. Let us present the elements of the\nobservable as the following points.\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\nPCA\n\n\u03c1\n\nDP\n\n\u03c4\n\u03c0\n\nPP\n\nFigure 1: Schematic view of the \u03c4 decay to \u03c1 and \u03bd\u03c4 . P P is the \u03c4 production point, DP\nthe \u03c4 decay point, and P CA the point of closest approach. Directions and energies of \u03c0 \u00b1 ,\n\u03c0 0 , \u03c1\u00b1 are directly measurable, the energy of the \u03c4 \u00b1 can be reconstructed from the event\ntopology. The \u03c4 momentum must be placed on the cone (drawn on the plot) and the \u03c4\nimpact parameter can be used to determine the actual position.\n1. Acoplanarity of the \u03c1+ and \u03c1\u2212 decay planes:\n2\n\n\fA)\n\n\u03c0\n\nB)\n\nC)\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c0\nFigure 2: The circle of candidates for \u03c4 momentum. Depending on the possible geometrical\nconfiguration, three cases are possible: A) \u03c0 direction inside the circle: single candidate\nfor \u03c4 momentum. B) \u03c0 direction outside the circle: two candidates for \u03c4 momentum.\nC) \u03c0 direction outside the circle and no crossing of dashed line with the circle (due to\ndetection ambiguities of measured angles and energies). We take in this case the closest\npoint to the line. Effectively, we obtain a single solution.\n\u2022 The reconstructed four-momenta of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 0 are combined to yield the \u03c1+\nfour-momentum. The same is done for the \u03c1\u2212 .\n\u2022 All reconstructed four-momenta are boosted into the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 rest frame.\n\n\u2022 The angle \u03c6 between the planes of the \u03c1+ and \u03c1\u2212 decay products in this frame\nis the acoplanarity.\n2. Normalized energy differences:\nThe events are divided into two classes depending on the value of y1 y2 , where\ny1 =\n\nE\u03c0+ \u2212 E\u03c00\n;\nE\u03c0+ + E\u03c00\n\ny2 =\n\nE\u03c0\u2212 \u2212 E\u03c00\n.\nE\u03c0\u2212 + E\u03c00\n\n(1)\n\nThe energies of \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c0 0 are to be taken in the respective \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames.\n3. Replacement \u03c4 rest frame:\nIn Ref. [8] the method of reconstruction of replacement \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames was proposed.\nWe will use this method here as well, but we will omit the details. In fact they are\nrather unimportant. The energies of pions taken directly from the laboratory frame\ncan equally well be used in the above definitions of Eq. (1).\n4. Higgs rest frame:\nIf the information on the beam energies and the energies of all other observed\n3\n\n\fparticles is taken into consideration, the Higgs rest frame can be reconstructed,\nfor instance in the Higgsstrahlung production process, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ, when the Z\nboson decays either into a charged lepton pair or hadronically. We may define\nthe 'reconstructed' Higgs boson momentum as the difference of the sum of beam\nmomenta and momenta of all visible particles, i.e. decay products of Z and all\nradiative photons of | cos \u03b8| < 0.98.\n5. \u03c4 energy:\n\u2022 In the reconstructed Higgs boson rest frame, the \u03c4 four-momenta are estimated\nin a crude way by assuming the direction of the respective \u03c1's and an energy\nof mH /2.\n\u2022 The \u03c4 momenta are boosted back to the laboratory frame and their energies\nare taken to be the reconstructed energies of \u03c4 leptons.\n6. \u03c4 direction:\nThe \u03c4 direction in the laboratory system is constrained by two requirements:\n\u2022 It has to lie on a cone around the \u03c1 direction with opening angle \u03c8 defined as:\ncos \u03c8 =\n\n2E\u03c4 E\u03c1 \u2212 m2\u03c4 \u2212 m2\u03c1\n,\n2~p\u03c4 ~p\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E, ~p, m are the energy, momentum and mass, respectively. The fourmomentum of \u03c1 is measured as the sum of the four-momenta of its charged\nand neutral daughters.\n\u2022 It has to lie in the plane spanned by the vector pointing from P P to P CA and\nthe \u03c0 + momentum.\nThe intersection of the cone and the plane is calculated numerically. There are three\ncases:\n\u2022 One solution: the solution is taken as the \u03c4 direction (see Fig. 2 case A).\n\n\u2022 Two solutions: one of the two solutions (see Fig. 2 case B) is taken on a random\nbasis.\n\u2022 No solution: the direction on the cone closest to the P CA\u2013\u03c0 + momentum\nplane is taken (see Fig. 2 case C).\n\n4\n\n\f7. Impact parameter improved replacement \u03c4 -rest frame:\nWith the help of the \u03c4 energy and \u03c4 momentum defined in points 5 and 6 above,\na new impact parameter improved replacement \u03c4 rest frame can be defined. In this\nway we have an alternative way of estimating the difference of \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c0 0 energies see\nEq. (1) in \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames.\n\n3\n\nMonte Carlo set-up\n\nIn the following discussion all the Monte Carlo samples have been generated with the\nTAUOLA library [15,16,17]. For the production of \u03c4 lepton pairs, the Monte Carlo program\nPYTHIA 6.1 [18] was used1 . The production process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 (q q\u0304)H has been\nchosen, with a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV and a centre-of-mass energy of 350 GeV.\nThe effects of initial-state bremsstrahlung were included in the PYTHIA generation.\nFor the \u03c4 \u00b1 lepton pair decay (with full spin effects from the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 (\u03bd\u03c4 ),\n\u03c1\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 chain) the interface explained in Ref. [9] was used. It is an extended version\nof the interface of Refs. [20, 21].\n\n4\n\nDetection parameters\n\nTo test the feasibility of the measurement, some assumptions about the detector effects\nhave to be made. We include, as the most critical for our discussion, effects due to inaccuracies in the measurements of the \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c0 0 momenta and \u03c4 \u00b1 leptons impact parameters. We\nassume Gaussian spreads of the 'measured' quantities with respect to the generated ones,\nand we use the following algorithm to reconstruct the energies of \u03c0's in their respective\n\u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames.\n1. Charged-pion momentum: We assume a 0.1% spread on its energy and direction.\n2. Neutral-pion momentum: We assume an energy spread of \u221a 5%\n\nE[GeV]\n\n. For the\n\n2\u03c0\n. (These neutral pion resolutions can be\n\u03b8 and \u03c6 angular spread we assume 13 1800\nachieved with a 15% energy error and a 2\u03c0/1800 direction error in the gammas\nresulting from the \u03c0 0 decays.) These resolutions have been approximately verified\nwith a SIMDET [22], a parametric Monte Carlo program for a TESLA detector [23].\n1\n\nIt was shown that the interface can work in the same manner with the HERWIG [19] generator.\n\n5\n\n\fNevts\n\nNevts\n\nbin\n\nbin\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n0 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n0 :0\n\n3 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n3 :0\n\nFigure 3: The acoplanarity distribution angle \u03c6 of the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products in the rest\nframe of the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair.

The simulation is based on the anticipated performance of a 5-layer CCD vertex detector as described in [23].

We\nuse this resolution in our simulations.\n\n6\n\n\fNevts\n\nNevts\n\nbin\n\nbin\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n0 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n0 :0\n\n3 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n3 :0\n\nFigure 4: The acoplanarity distribution angle \u03c6 of the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products in the rest\nframe of the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair.

The usefulness of this acoplanarity distribution manifests itself\nonly after selection cuts are applied.\nIn Fig. 3, our \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products acoplanarity distribution angle \u03c6, defined in the\nrest frame of the reconstructed \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair is shown. Unobservable generator-level \u03c4 \u00b1 rest\nframes are used for the calculation of selection cuts (Eq. (1)). The two plots represent\nevents selected by the differences of \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 energies defined in these respective \u03c4 \u00b1 rest\nframes. On the left plot, the signs are required to be the same y1 y2 > 0, whereas on the\nright one, events are taken with y1 y2 < 0. This figure quantifies the size of the parity effect\nin an idealized condition, which we will attempt to approach with realistic ones. The size\nof the effect was substantially diminished when the detector set-up was included for \u03c4 \u00b1\nrest frames reconstruction as well, see Fig. 4, following exactly the method of Ref. [8].\n7\n\n\fNevts\n\nNevts\n\nbin\n\nbin\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n0 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n0 :0\n\n3 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n3 :0\n\nFigure 5: The \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products' acoplanarity distribution angle, \u03c6, in the rest frame\nof the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair. Full smearing is included. The \u03c4 lepton impact parameter is used in the\nreconstruction of the \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames. The thick line corresponds to a scalar Higgs boson,\nthe thin line to a pseudoscalar one. The left figure contains events with y1 y2 > 0, the right\nis for y1 y2 < 0.\nLet us use this result later, as a reference point to quantify the size of our improvements.\nIt turns out that a slight improvement is visible, when the impact parameter is taken\nfor the \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames determination, as explained in section 4. In fact, the maximum\nrelative difference between the scalar and pseudoscalar cases is larger by \u223c 12% (compare\nFigs. 4 and 5) if a Gaussian spread of the \u03c4 impact parameter \u03c3IP = 25\u25e6 is used. We\nhave also checked that the precision of the \u03c4 lepton impact parameter measurement is not\ncritical in this case. The twofold ambiguities as explained in Fig. 2 are the main reason\nfor the sensitivity to be much lower than in Fig. 3.\nAt the cost of introducing cuts and thus reducing the number of accepted events, we\ncan go one step further in the improvement of the method. We first start by requiring\nthat the signs of the energy differences y1 and y2 be the same with both methods (with\nand without \u03c4 lepton impact parameter). The result is depicted in Fig. 6. Only \u223c 52%\nof events are accepted, but the parity effect grows by \u223c 107% in comparison to Fig. 4.\nThe events can also be treated differently, according to the number of solutions; see\nFig. 2. If the same cut is imposed only for \u03c4 \u00b1 leptons with double solutions, while for\n8\n\n\fNevts\n\nNevts\n\nbin\n\nbin\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n0 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n0 :0\n\n3 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n3 :0\n\nFigure 6: The \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products' acoplanarity distribution angle, \u03c6, in the rest frame\nof the \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair. Only events where the signs of the energy differences y1 and y2 are the\nsame whether calculated using the method described in Ref. [8] or with the help of the \u03c4\nimpact parameter are taken. The thick line corresponds to a scalar Higgs boson, the thin\nline to a pseudoscalar one.\nsingle-solution events the \u03c4 \u00b1 rest frames obtained with the help of the impact parameter\nare used alone, the number of accepted events turns out to be \u223c 72%, but the parity\neffect is larger by only \u223c 67% than in Fig. 4. This result is depicted in Fig. 7.\nOther cuts are also envisageable, but the two proposed here are easy to implement and\nlead to an acceptable loss of statistics, together with a sizeable increase of parity effect so\nthat there is not much room for further improvements.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nWe have found that the measurement of the impact parameter can be helpful in the\ndetermination of the Higgs boson parity at a future linear collider, using the H/A \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ;\n\u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 (\u03bd\u03c4 ) cascade decay. Thanks to the improved method the effect of parity is\nenhanced by \u223c 107% at the cost of losing only \u223c 48% events, which represents a gain\nof a factor of \u223c 1.5 in sensitivity with respect to the analysis without impact parameter.\n9\n\n\fNevts\n\nNevts\n\nbin\n\nbin\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n2:5 \u0001 104\n\n0 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n0 :0\n\n3 :0\n\n0 :5\n\n1 :0\n\n1 :5\n\n'\n\n2 :0\n\n2 :5\n\n3 :0\n\nFigure 7: he \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 decay products' acoplanarity distribution angle, \u03c6, in the rest frame of\nthe \u03c1+ \u03c1\u2212 pair, with cuts depending on the position of the pion with respect to the \u03c4 cone.\nThe selection is as in Fig. 6, but in the case of single-solution events (Fig. 2 case A), the\nresult from the old method is ignored. The thick line corresponds to a scalar Higgs boson,\nthe thin line to a pseudoscalar one.\nThis correspond to \u223c 4.5\u03c3 separation between scalar and pseudoscalar for the 120 GeV\nStandard Model Higgs and other assumptions similar to the one taken in Ref. [8].\nWe have also checked, that reasonable variations in the assumptions of detection uncertainties in measurement of charged and neutral \u03c0's as well as of the \u03c4 + and \u03c4 \u2212 impact\nparameters, hardly change the sensitivity of our method at all. This is because the dominant uncertainty is saturated by the twofold ambiguity as explained in Fig. 2. We are\nafraid that a reconstruction of the Higgs boson momentum to precision better than the \u03c4\nmass would be needed to resolve the ambiguity. This seems unrealistic for several reasons,\ne.g. the beamstrahlung effect.\nProbably, a fit to the multidimensional distribution might be more efficient than the\nsimple cuts applied in this work. We believe, however, that such studies should be done\nonly when the detector properties have been understood better. Finally, we expect that\nfurther improvements, e.g. involving the \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 a\u00b1\n1 \u03bd\u03c4 decay mode, may turn out to be\nhelpful for the measurement of the Higgs boson parity.\n\n10\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis work is partly supported by the Polish State Committee for Scientific Research\n(KBN) grants Nos 5P03B09320, 2P03B00122 as well as the BMBF (WTZ) project number\nPOL 01/103 and by the DESY & INP Cracow collaboration grant TESLA.\nOne of the authors (M.W.) is grateful for the warm hospitality extended to her by\nthe FLC group at DESY in Hamburg.
