Introduction\nTop-quark measurements are of central importance to the LHC physics programme. The\nproduction of top-quark pairs in pp collisions is a process which is situated at the boundary between the Standard Model (SM) and what might lie beyond it. Within the SM, top\nquarks are predicted to almost always decay to a b-quark and a W -boson, that can further\ndecay leptonically or hadronically. The final states are thus characterised by the presence\nof two (dilepton), one (single lepton) or no leptons (all hadronic channel). With an integrated\nluminosity of 0.70 \u2212 1.08fb\u22121 of pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at\n\u221a\ns = 7 TeV in the first half of 2011 a variety of precision and new measurement have\nbeen obtained.\n2. Top quark pair production cross-section \u03c3tt\u0304\n\u221a\nWithin the SM the tt\u0304 production cross-section at s = 7 TeV is calculated to be 165+11\n\u221216 pb\nat approximate NNLO for a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV. A precise determination of\n\u03c3tt\u0304 tests these perturbative QCD predictions. First measurements of \u03c3tt\u0304 at the LHC have\nbeen reported by ATLAS and CMS with 3 pb\u22121 and 35 pb\u22121 . With approximately twenty\ntimes more data the single lepton, dilepton and lepton+\u03c4 channels have been measured.\nIn the single-lepton channel a multivariate likelihood discriminant is constructed using\ntemplate distributions of four variables [1]. Data are split according to lepton flavour and\n\u2217 ON\n\nBEHALF OF THE ATLAS COLLABORATION\n\n\u2020 cristinz@uni-bonn.de\n\n1\n\n\fMarkus Cristinziani\n\n3 Jets\n\n2000\n\nData 2011, \u221as = 7 TeV\ntt\nQCD Multijet\nW+Jets\nOther EW\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\u222bL dt = 0.70 fb\u20131\n\n1600\n\u03bc + Jets\n\n1200\n\n3 Jets\n\n4 Jets\n\n\u22655 Jets\n\ne + Jets\n4 Jets\n\nAll channels\nData\ntt\nZ/ \u03b3 *+jets\nFake leptons\nOther EW\n\n140 ATLAS Preliminary\n120\n\n\u222b\n\nData\nt t \u2192\u03bc\u03c4 +bb\nhad\nST, diboson\nZ + jet\nW + jet\n\n-1\n\nL dt = 1.08 fb\n\n100\n\nt t \u2192ll+bb\nt t \u2192l+jjbb\nuncertainty\n\n\u22655 Jets\n\n600\n\n400\nRatio Data/Fit\n\n\u222b L dt = 0.70 fb\n\n-1\n\n800\n\n800\n\n80\n60\n\nBDT j > 0.7\n\n400\n40\n\n1.5\n\n200\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n1000\n\nOS - SS Events\n\n2400\n\nEvents\n\nEvents\n\nnumber of jets. A profile likelihood technique is used to extract \u03c3tt\u0304 and constrain the systematic effects from data. The result is \u03c3tt\u0304 = 179.0 \u00b1 9.8 (stat.+syst.) \u00b1 6.6 (lumi.) pb,\nthe most precise measurement of \u03c3tt\u0304 at LHC to date. In the dilepton channel a cut-andcount method is employed [2]. The background contribution from Drell-Yan production\nmiss\nis suppressed by requiring for same-flavour events large ET\nand for e\u03bc events large\nHT , the scalar sum of jet and lepton transverse energies. Remaining Drell-Yan events and\nbackground from fake leptons are estimated with data-driven methods.

A\nsecond measurement requiring at least one b-jet yields a consistent result. A cross-section\nmeasurement is also performed in final states with an isolated muon and a hadronically\ndecaying \u03c4 -lepton [3]. At least two jets, one of them b-tagged, are required.

Single top-quark production\nSingle top-quark production has been explored in the three channels (t, W t and s). For\nthe t-channel measurement a cut-based analysis exploiting the two- and three-jet bins is\nperformed and exactly one b-tag is required [4]. An excess of top candidates is observed\nover antitop candidates. The measured cross-section is \u03c3tt\u2212chan = 90\u00b19 (stat.)+31\n\u221220 (syst.)\npb in agreement with the SM prediction and has been cross-checked with an analysis\nbased on neural networks. For the search for the associated production of a top quark and\na W -boson only the leptonic decays of the two W bosons are considered [5]. A simple\ncut-based approach is used to select the W t contribution. At the 95% C.L. \u03c3tWt\u2212chan <\n39(41) pb for the observed (expected) upper limit. For the search in the s-channel single\ntop-quark production two b-jets are required [6]. With a cut-based analysis an upper limit\nof \u03c3ts\u2212chan < 26.5(20.5) pb is obtained at 95% C.L.\n4. Top-quark properties\nThe top-quark mass (mtop ) has been measured using a two-dimensional template analysis in the single-lepton channel that determines mtop together with a global jet energy\nscale factor [7]. Combining the electron and muon channels and the results from the\n2010 ATLAS data, the top-quark mass is measured to be mtop = 175.9 \u00b1 0.9 (stat.) \u00b1\n2\n\n\fATLAS Preliminary\n2 jets 1 tag\n\n0.70 fb-1@7TeV\n\n100\n80\n\n600\n\n40\n\n200\n\n20\n\n100\nElectron +\n\nElectron -\n\nMuon -\n\nData\nWt\nFake leptons\nZ(\u2192 ee/\u03bc\u03bc)+jets\nZ(\u2192 \u03c4\u03c4)+jets\n\n-1\n\nDiboson\n\n60\n\nMuon +\n\nDilepton Combined\n\n\u222b L dt = 0.70 fb\n\n400\n300\n\n0\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n500\n\nCandidate Events\n\n120\n\nNumber of Events\n\nCandidate Events\n\nTop physics at ATLAS\n\n0 0\n\ntt\n\n0.70 fb-1 @ 7 TeV\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n2 jets 2-tag\n\n60\nATLAS data\nsingle-top s-channel\nsingle-top Wt\nsingle-top t-channel\ntop pairs\nW+heavy flavour\nW+light jets\nDiboson\nZ+jets\nMultijets\n\n40\n20\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nLepton flavour and charge\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n9\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nm top, b\u2212jet1 [GeV/c2]\n\nNumber of Jets\n\nFigure 2. Single top-quark production in the t-(left [4]), W t-(centre [5]), and\ns-channel (right [6]), respectively\n\n2.7 (syst.) GeV. The top-antitop charge asymmetry is measured in the single-lepton channel [8]. A kinematic likelihood is used to reconstruct the tt\u0304 event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The charge asymmetry observable AC is based on the difference of the absolute values of top and antitop rapidities, |Yt | \u2212 |Yt\u0304 |. It is measured to\nbe AC = \u22120.024 \u00b1 0.016 (stat.) \u00b1 0.023 (syst.), in agreement with the SM prediction of\nAC = 0.006. Spin correlation in tt\u0304 events are studied in the dilepton channel [9]. The spin\ninformation is accessed via the angular distributions of its decay products. The difference\nin azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons is compared to the expected distributions in the SM, and to the case where the top quarks are produced with uncorrelated\nspin. Using the helicity basis as the quantisation axis, the strength of the spin correlation\nbetween the top and antitop quark is measured to be Ahelicity = 0.34+0.15\n\u22120.11 , which is in\nagreement with the NLO SM prediction. Helicities of W -bosons in top-quark decays have\nbeen measured in the single- and di-lepton channels [10]. At least one of the jets in the\nsingle-lepton final state is required to be b-tagged. The results are in agreement with the\nSM. As the polarisation of the W -bosons in top-quark decays is sensitive to the structure\nof the W tb-vertex the measurements are used to set limits on anomalous contributions to\nthe W tb-vertex.\n\n0.8\n\n\u00d710\n\n3\n\n(Date: August 15, 2011)\n\n173.8 \u00b1 6.7 \u00b1 4.8\n\n2010 data \u03bc+jets prel.\n\n166.7 \u00b1 5.0 \u00b1 5.0\n\n2010 data l+jets prel.\n\n169.3 \u00b1 4.0 \u00b1 4.9\n\n2011 data e+jets prel.\n\n173.9 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 3.1\n\n2011 data \u03bc+jets prel.\n\n175.9 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 2.7\n\n2010+2011 data l+jets prel.\n\n175.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 2.7\n\nRun-I best (D0 l+jets)\n\n180.1 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b1 3.9\n\nRun-II best (CDF l+jets)\n\n173.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 1.1\n\nTevatron July 2011\n\n173.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.8\n\n25\n\nEvents\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n2010 data e+jets prel.\n\nEvents\n\n11\n\ne + \u2265 4 jets (b tag)\n\nATLAS Preliminary\n\n\u222b L = 0.70 fb\n\n20\n\n400\n\n300\n\n15\n\n180\n\nmtop [GeV]\n\n200\n\n\u222b\n\n100\n\n5\n\n0\n-3\n\nDilepton channel\ndata\nATLAS Preliminary\ntt\nt t (A=0)\n-1\nsingle top\nLdt = 0.70 fb\nDY+jets\ndiboson\nfake leptons\n\n200\n\n10\n\n0.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b1 0.0\n160\n\n500\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nYt - Yt\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\u2206\u03c6\n\nFigure 3.

A limit at\n95% C.L. is set excluding a cross-section times branching ratio of 1.1 pb for a top-partner\nmass of 420 GeV and a neutral particle mass less than 10 GeV. In a search for high\nmass tt\u0304 resonances in the dilepton channel [12] no excess above the SM expectation is\nobserved. Upper limits at the 95% C.L are set on the cross-section times branching ratio\nof the resonance decaying to tt\u0304 pairs as a function of the resonance pole mass. A lower\nmass limit of 0.84 TeV is set for the case of a Kaluza-Klein gluon resonance in the\nRandall-Sundrum Model.\n\nfb\n\u222bL dt=1.04\ns=7 TeV\n\n(\n150 m\n\nKK\n\n-1\n\n0.5\n\ng \u2192tt\nKK\n\ns = 7 TeV\n10\n\n100\n\nExpected Limit (\u00b11\u03c3)\n\n0\n\nObs.
