Contrary to\none's intuition, it is shown that the self-avoiding random walk, which has been verified as an optimal strategy\nfor searching on scale-free and small-world networks, is not the best strategy for the DAN in the thermodynamic\nlimit.\nPACS numbers: 89.75.Hc, 05.40.Fb, 89.75.Fb\n\nIn the past few years, much attention has been devoted to\nthe characterization and modelling of a wide range of complex\nsystems that can be described as networks [1, 2, 3]. The topological properties of real-world networks have been studied\nextensively. But an even more intriguing task, and a natural\nextension of these studies, is to understand how the topological structure of networks affects dynamics taking place on top\nof them [4]. Many dynamic processes have been studied on\ncomplex networks, such as epidemic spreading [5], percolation [6], and synchronization [7] et al. These researches show\nthat topologies of networks play a crucial role in determining\nthe system dynamical features.\nRandom walk has been used for modelling various dynamics in physical, biological, and social contexts [8]. It\ncould also be a mechanism of transport and search on network [9, 10, 11]. Thus, one interesting problem is to study the\ndynamical behavior of a random walker on networks with different topological properties. Much is known about random\nwalks on both regular and random networks [12, 13]. Recently, there have also been several studies of random walks\non small-world networks (SWNs) [14, 15, 16, 17] and on\nscale-free networks (SFNs) [9, 18, 19, 20]. The impacts of\nthe heterogeneous topological structures of the networks on\nthe nature of the diffusive and relaxation dynamics of the random walk were probed [9, 10, 21, 22]. Also, finding efficient\nalgorithms for searching on networks with different topological properties is an important issue related to random walks\n[9, 18, 20].\nIn this paper we investigate walking processes taking place\nupon the determinist Apollonian network (DAN) [23] and its\nvariation, the random Apollonian network (RAN) [24]. The\nDAN can be defined based of the ancient problem of filling\nspace with spheres, first tackled by the Greek mathematician\nApollonius of Perga [25]. That is, starting with an initial array\nof touching disks, which have curvilinear-triangle interstices,\ndisks are added inside each existed interstice in the present\nconfiguration, such that these disks touch each of the disks\n\n\u2217 For\n\ncorrespondence: yhwang@lzu.edu.cn\n\nbounding the curvilinear triangles. These added disks give\nrise to three smaller interstices, which will be filled in the\nnext generation. This process is then repeated for successive\ngenerations. The DAN is constructed based on this process\nby considering each disk as a node, and the disks in contact\nas the corresponding nodes connected. For each new node\nadded to a certain triangle (corresponding to the curvilineartriangle interstice), the three vertices are linked to, and three\nnew triangles are created in the network, into which nodes will\nbe inserted in the next generation. Different from recursive\nconstructing of the DAN [23], the RAN starts with a triangle\ncontaining three nodes. Then, at each time step, one triangle is randomly selected to add a new node [24]. Both networks are simultaneously scale-free, small-world, Euclidean,\nand space filling, and have attracted an increasing interest recently [26, 27, 28].\nWe carry out the random walk along the bonds of a given\nnetwork as follows: (i) There is only one walker on the network at a time; (ii) The random walker is injected onto a\nrandomly chosen node on the network, a new node for each\nwalker. We will call this node the \"origin\" of the walk; (iii) At\neach discrete time step t, the walker will jump to one nearest\nneighbor of its current node according to one certain strategy;\n(iv) We average over different random walkers and realizations of the network until the results converge.\nThe walk strategies adopted by the walker include the following: random walk (RW), no-back (NB) walk, no-triangleloop (NTL) walk, no-quadrangle-loop (NQL) walk, and selfavoiding (SA) random walk. For the RW, the walker may unrestrictedly jump to a neighbor node by randomly taking one\nof the links. It forgets all information about its past. The NB\nwalk implies that a random walker, if possible, will not return\nto the node it was situated at the previous step. Similarly, NTL\nand NQL random walks mean that the walker will try to avoid\nwalking in loops, with three or four edges, respectively, unless there is no other choice. We mention that the NQL walk\nalso includes the NTL, which means it eliminates quadrangle\nloops as well as triangle loops. Finally, the SA random walk\nimplies that the walker is the smarter. It tries to avoid revisiting the node that it has already visited in a run of the search.\nSurely, the SA walk also includes the NTL and NQL walks.\n\n\f2\n\nDAN\n\nMFPT\n\n104\n3\n\n10\n\n104\n-0.848(8)\n\nPc \u2248\nhLi\n\n-0.596(0)\n\n103\n102\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\nDAN\n\n104\nART\n\nTABLE I: The PSP threshold Pc and average path length hLi of the\nfour networks with size N = 9844.\n\nRAN\n\n103\n\nRAN\n\n-1.000(6)\n\n2\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n102\n\n101\n\n102\nk\n\nk\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The mean first passage times hTij i (upper\npanels) and the average return time hTii i (lower panels), both of\nwhich are average over the results of given k's, for DANs (left-hand)\nand RANs (right-hand). Fitted linear relations of average return time\n(solid lines) are obtained with a slope of \u22121 for both DANs and\nRANs.\n\nOne can imagine that an unrestricted RW walker may be\ntrapped into high-clustering regions and revisit nodes there\nfor a long time by reason of walking in loops. While a walker\nadopting other strategies like NB, NTL and NQL can escape\nfrom those regions easier, and therefore improve the search\nefficiency. Thus, different clustering properties of the underlying networks will induce different efficiencies of the above\nmentioned strategies. In return, the clustering effect of the\nnetworks could be reflected by the efficiencies of those search\nstrategies.\nIn the context of transport and search, the mean first passage\ntime (MFPT) and the average return time (ART) are important\ncharacteristics of the random walk. The average return time\ndenoted by hTii i is the average time needed for a walker to\nreturn to the origin i, which is a special case of MFPT from\ni to j denoted by hTij i. Noh and Rieger [18] have proved\nthat the MFPT is negatively correlated with Kj , and hTii i is\ndetermined only by the total number of links and the degree\nof the node i\nP\n\nhTii i = N /Ki\n\nRAN\n0.03\n5.40(9)\n\nBA\n0.3\n4.27(9)\n\nWS\n0.63\n8.61(9)\n\n102\n\n104\n103\n\n-1.000(9)\n\n10\n\n101\n\nDAN\n4/N\n4.06(5)\n\n(1)\n\nwith N =\nj Kj (j = 1, . . . , N ). Namely, nodes with\nhigher degrees are visited earlier and more frequently, and\ntherefore targets on these nodes are more easily found out than\non nodes with smaller degrees. In Fig. 1 we depict simulations\nof the MFPT (the upper panels) and ART (the lower panels)\nas a function of nodes degree for the DAN and RAN with size\nN = 9844. After averaging over the MFPT and ART for a\ngiven degree k, the linear property of the log-log plot of ART\n(the lower panels) is in excellent agreement with Eq. (1), and\nthe negative correlation between MFPT and k are also presented (the upper panels).\nIn the following, we will investigate walking processes\non DANs and RANs. The corresponding results on WattsStrogatz (WS) (K = 3, p0 = 0.1) [29] and Barab\u00e1si-Albert\n\n(BA) (m = m0 = 3) [30] networks are also presented for\ncomparison. Note that, the four networks have the same average degree hki = 6.\nFirstly, let us discuss the search efficiency of all the five\nwalk strategies mentioned above for the four networks. We\nsuppose at every step, the walker adopting various strategies\nonly know neighbors of its present node. So if the target is\nat one neighbor of the present node where the walker stays,\nthis round of search is over. The walks for the five strategies\nare performed and the search times (see Fig. 2) are averaged\nover 200 different couples of initial positions and targets of\nthe walker, and 50 realizations of the networks. One can find\nsome common properties from Fig. 2. For example, the approximate power-law relations hold for all search processes\nof RW, NB, NTL, NQL and SA walks. As another example,\nthe RW walk is the most inefficient search strategy for all the\nfour networks. Nevertheless, some obvious differences still\nexist among them. The search efficiencies of NB, NTL and\nNQL walks nearly collapse into one only for BA network (see\nFig. 2 (c), also in Ref. [20]). This can be understood by its\ncomparatively smallest clustering coefficient as to the other\nthree networks. In the weak clustering networks, the NB,\nNTL and NQL walkers, who adopt increasingly strict law to\navoid revisit, can not take their advantages and their search efficiencies keep very closely or even collapse into one. Hence,\nfor DANs and RANs, the efficiency-improvement of NTL and\nNQL walks as to the NB walk reflects the fact that high clustered nodes are popular on them.\nThe SA walk was proved to be generally the most efficient\nstrategy for searching on networks, whose small-world properties were considered to be the reason [20]. However, it is\ncounterexample for the DAN (see Fig. 2(b)). The DAN is one\nof typical regular networks which has deterministic size when\nthe number of the generations is certain [23, 26]. Its short\naverage length and high clustering coefficient indeed describe\na small-world scenario. Fig. 2(b) shows the average search\ntimes for DANs with 3 to 8 generations, corresponding to network sizes 16, 43, 124, 367, 1096, and 3283, respectively.\nContrast to the conclusions in Ref. [20], the SA walk does not\nreduce the search time and is even more inefficient than the\nNTL and NQL walks when N is large. We argue that what is\nimportant for the improvement of the search efficiency is not\ntaking more strict law to eliminate repeating visits, but considering the factual structure of the networks.\nAccording to the former analysis of MFPT, we know that\nthe high-degree nodes would be visited early, so as to be\navoided by SA walker preferentially. Thus, to some extent the\nSA search process can be considered as the question of intentional attack [31] or preferential site percolation (PSP) on networks. The intentional attack means the removal of nodes and\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n3\n10\n\n(b)\n\nRAN\n\nDAN\n2\n\n10\n\nRW\n\nt\n\nt\n\nRW\nNB\n\n2\n\n10\n\nNB\n\n1\n\n10\n\nNTL\nNQL\n\nNTL\nNQL\n\nSA\n\n2\n\nSA\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nN\n\n(c)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\nN\n\n(d)\n\nBA\nm=m0=3\n\nWS\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nK=3, p=0.1\n\nt\n\nRW\n\nt\n\n10\n\nRW\n\nNB\nNTL\nNQL\n\nNB\n\n2\n\n10\n\nNTL\nNQL\nSA\n\nSA\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nN\n\n3\n\nN\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Average search times of various search strategies for RANs (a), DANs (b), BA networks (c), and WS networks (d).\n\n2\n\n10\n\n102\n\n1\n\n10\n\nDAN\nRAN\n\nNcov\n\n2\n\n<R >\n\nslope=1\n\n101\n\nWS\n\nDAN\n\nBA\n\nRAN\n\n0\n\n10 0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nWS\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\nBA\n\n100 0\n10\n\n101\n\n102\n\nt\n\nFIG. 3: Mean-square distance hR2 i as a function of time for DANs,\nRANs, WS and BA networks with size N = 9844 and average degree hki = 6 fixed.

I for Pc ),\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Network coverage Ncov after t steps on (solid\nline from top to bottom) BA networks, DANs, RANs and WS networks with N = 9844 and hki = 6 fixed.\n\nbecause of the crucial importance of the high-degree nodes to\nthe network integrates [24]. When walking on networks, if the\nwalkers strictly avoid visiting these crucial high-degree nodes,\n\n\f4\nthey can hardly move from their current part of the network\nto other parts, as if the network was intentionally attacked\nand disintegrated into partes. However, as a search strategy,\nthe SA search processes on the original network are not totally the same as the intentional attacks, because SA walker\nat node i can revisit nodes, including these crucial nodes, although, with probability 1/ki only in condition that all the ki\nneighbors have already been visited. The compulsive revisits\ninsure that the targets in different parts of networks can finally\nbe found. Considering the similarity between SA search and\nintentional attack or PSP, we can conclude that the SA search\nstrategy, compared with other mentioned strategies, will improve the search efficiency to certain extent for the networks\nwith higher PSP threshold.\nNext, we will present our simulation results for two quantities, the mean-square displacement and the network coverage (the average number of distinct sites visited). The meansquare displacement hR2 (t)i of a particle diffusing in a given\nspace, which is a measure of the distance R covered by a typical RW walker after performing t steps, is one of the most\nbasic quantities in the random walk theory [16, 19]. In most\ncases, this quantity is described by an expression of the form\nhR2 (t)i \u223c ta . The value of the parameter a classifies the\ntype of diffusion into normal linear diffusion (a = 1), subdiffusion (a > 1), or superlinear diffusion (a < 1). When\nconsidering the unrestricted RW walk along the bonds of networks, the maximum value of a can be 2 [19]. To calculate\nhR2 (t)i we first, at each time step, find the minimal distance\nfrom the current position of the walker to the origin (i.e., the\nsmallest number of steps needed for the walker to reach the\norigin) using a breadth-first search method. Then we allow\nthe walker to move through the network until hR2 (t)i has saturated. Finally, the results are average over different initial\npositions of the walkers and realizations of the network. We\nsimulate hR2 (t)i for the DAN, RAN, WS and BA networks\nwith N = 9844, and report it as a function of time in Fig.\n3. One important feature is the fact that hR2 (t)i equilibrates\nafter a few steps to a constant displacement value. This is\na simple manifestation of the small diameter of these finite\n\nnetworks. Note also that, because of the differences of the\naverage path length hLi of these networks (see Table. I for\nhLi), the plateau values are also different. For the DANs and\nRANs, one can find that the slope of hR2 i in the early time is\nsmall, especially that of RANs. This can be explained as a result of their highly clustering effect which induces the walker\ninitially spends many time exploring the cluster it was created\nin and thus the distance to the origin increases slowly. After a few steps the walker escapes its initial territory and diffuses around the entire network. From the slope of hR2 i, we\nknow that diffusions both on DANs and RANs are sublinear,\nand diffusions both on BA and WS networks are superlinear.\nThe network coverage denoted by Ncov is defined as average\nnumber of distinct visited nodes of the RW walker. Results\nof Ncov on the four networks are presented in Fig. 4. The\nnumber of steps performed is nearly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the size of the networks, in order to decrease finite size effects. The clustering effects of DANs and RANs\nare reflected by their relatively low coverage compared to BA\nnetworks.\n\n[1] R. Albert and A.L. Barab\u00e1si, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74, 47 (2002).\n[2] S.N.

The\nefficiency of search strategies are simulated and the clustering\nand short path effects of networks to the dynamics are discussed. It is found that, for the DAN with large size, the best\nsearch strategy is no longer the self-avoiding random walk.\nThe importance of the high-degree nodes to the network integrates are suppose to be one reason. Thus the search strategy\non networks should be assigned closely based on the topological structure of the underlying networks, including the clustering, the average path length as well as the essentiality of\nthe high-degree nodes. Since search is a problem of extreme\nimportance for so many natural and artificial networks, this\nfinding may be valuable in practicability. Finally, the simulation results of mean-square displacement hR2 (t)i and network coverage Ncov also show the influences of the structure\nof networks to the dynamics of random walks.\n\n\f5\nPhys.
