Localizable charges generate internal (gauge) symmetry which is, in\nturn, intimately related to statistics. In space-time dimension D \u2265 3 + 1 this is accounted for,\nin the framework of the algebraic (local, relativistic) QFT [1], by the Doplicher-Roberts (DR)\ntheorem [2] implying that, typically, the full Hilbert space H of the theory decomposes in terms of\nthe superselection sectors Hp , inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables generated\nfrom the vacuum by (unobservable) charged fields, as\nM\nH=\nHp \u2297 Vp ,\ndp := dim Vp < \u221e ,\n(1.1)\np\n\nwhere Vp are (finite dimensional ) representations of a compact gauge group G whose action\nleaves the observables invariant. The exchange properties of the charged field generating a sector\nare characterized by a statistics parameter \u03bbp = \u00b1 d1p . If the statistics dimension dp is equal to 1,\nthe sign factor reflects the usual Bose-Fermi alternative. In general, higher dimensional representations of the permutation group are admitted which correspond to (Bose or Fermi) parastatistics;\nin this case, the integer dp is its order. As it follows from (1.1) and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of G, the statistics dimensions obey fusion rules of the type\nX\ndp1 dp2 =\n(1.2)\nNpp1 p2 \u2208 Z+ .\nNpp1 p2 dp ,\np\n\nFormula (1.1) is reminiscent of the classical Schur-Weyl duality, where the k-th tensor power\nof the defining representation of GL(N, C) (on which the permutation group Sk acts by exchanging the order of factors) decomposes in a sum, over the set of partitions P art(k, N ) of k\nin not more than N parts, of tensor products of irreps of GL(N, C) and Sk , the corresponding Young diagram of k boxes in r (\u2264 N ) rows labeling, in the first case, the highest weight:\n(CN )\u2297k \u2243 \u2295Y \u2208P art(k,N ) TY \u2297 VY . Thus, the endomorphisms coming from the one group centralize (the group algebra of) the other. Similar dualities exist for the symplectic and the orthogonal\ngroups, with the group algebra of the permutation group replaced by the corresponding Brauer algebra, and also for some q-deformations (with q generic) where this role is played by the Hecke\n(in the type A case), or Birman-Murakami-Wenzel (BMW) algebras, respectively, see e.g. [3].\nThe DR theorem establishes the equivalence of two different representation categories \u2013 the\none of charge endomorphisms of the algebra of local observables, and that of compact groups. (In\nparticular, the two sets of representations are identical and hence, can be parametrized by the same\nlabels.) The DR equivalence is considered as a non-commutative C \u2217 -algebraic generalization of\nthe Tannaka-Krein duality between compact groups and the category of their finite dimensional\nrepresentations which, in turn, generalizes the Pontryagin duality between abelian compact groups\nand their characters to the non-abelian case.\nFor D = 1 + 1 (and, in the case of non-localizable charges, also for D = 2 + 1), the more\ninvolved causal space-time structure leads to path depending exchange factors and, correspond-\n\n2\n\n\fingly, to braid group representations.1 This leads, in turn, to other drastic changes: the phase of\nthe statistics parameter \u03bbp may be non-trivial, and the statistics dimension dp \u2265 1 may take noninteger values [4]. The latter fact alone rules out the possibility of having a gauge symmetry of\ngroup type. This role is now taken by a \"quantum group\" (QG) [5], an algebra of Hopf type with\nsome additional structures. For a recent review of the achievements in classifying representations\nof local conformal nets of von Neumann factors, see e.g. [6].\nThe best studied class of two dimensional QFT is that of rational conformal field theories\n(RCFT) for which the category of representations of the vertex operator algebra (VOA; the analog\nof the algebra of observables) is semisimple, has finitely many simple objects (equivalence classes\nof irreducibles), and obeys certain non-degeneracy requirements i.e., is a modular tensor category\n(see the excellent book of B. Bakalov and A. Kirillov, Jr. [7]). It has been proven quite recently,\nsee [8, 9], that a finite semisimple tensor category is equivalent to the representation category of a\nweak Hopf algebra [10, 11] or, alternatively, of a related Ocneanu's double triangle algebra, see\ne.g. [12] and references therein.\nThe extension of the VOA-QG correspondence to finite but not necessarily semisimple categories is under intensive study, both by mathematicians and mathematical physicists, see [13]\nand [14]. Non-semisimple fusion algebras appear e.g. in logarithmic conformal theories (LCFT),\nin particular in some logarithmic extensions of minimal models that have been studied previously\nby H.G. Kausch, M.R. Gaberdiel, M. Flohr, etc. A general classification seems out of reach, so it\nis worth studying reasonable subclasses.\nD. Kazhdan and G. Lusztig (KL) have established, in the series of papers [15], the equivalence\n/ Q\u22650 with\nof certain tensor category of representations of the affine algebra \u011dh\u2212g\u2228 at height h \u2208\nthat of the finite dimensional modules of the quantum universal enveloping algebra (QUEA) Uq (g)\n\u03c0\nat q = ei mh (where m = 1 for simply laced g).2 Such a direct relation between the algebraic\nobjects \u011dk and Uq (g) (through their representation categories) is missing in the semisimple case\nof integrable \u011dk modules, for k \u2208 Z+ , where the equivalence is obtained only after taking the\nquotient with respect to an ideal of indecomposable modules of Uq (g).3\nIt has been shown recently, in another series of papers by B. Feigin et al. [16], that a KL\ncorrespondence exists between the VOA of a (p, p\u2032 ) LCFT model and certain (finite dimensional,\nfactorizable, ribbon) Hopf algebra, in the sense that the corresponding representation categories,\nfusion and modular properties are equivalent. In particular, a KL correspondence has been established, in the first paper of [16], between the (1, h) LCFT model (h \u2265 2) and the 2h3 -dimensional\ni\u03c0\nrestricted QUEA U q \u2261 U q sl(2) for q = e\u00b1 h . The latter is generated by E, F, q \u00b1H , satisfying\n1\n\nFollowing F. Wilczek, fields corresponding to 1-dimensional braid representations are called\n\"anyons\". Those obeying non-abelian braid statistics are sometimes referred to as \"plektons\",\nfrom the greek word for braid.\n2\nHere g \u2228 is the dual Coxeter number of the simple Lie algebra g. Note that h is allowed to\ntake negative rational values, h \u2208 Q<0 , when q is a root of unity and both categories are nonsemisimple.\n3\nCf. [17, 18]. The precise construction of the Uq (g) category uses the notion of tilting modules\n[19]. One of the proofs (see [7]) of its equivalence with the category of integrable \u011dh\u2212g\u2228 modules\nhas been given by M.

Here (B1 \u03bb\u03bc ) and (B2 \u03bb\u03bc ) , \u03bb , \u03bc = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1 are (lower and upper, respectively)\ntriangular p \u00d7 p matrices:\n\u0014 \u0015\n2\n\u03bb\np\u22121\u2212\u03bb \u03bb(\u03bc+1)\u2212 p 2\u22121 \u03bb\nq\nB1 \u03bc = (\u22121)\n= B2 p\u22121\u2212\u03bb\n(2.9)\np\u22121\u2212\u03bc .\n\u03bc\nDue to the fact that this set of solutions is well defined also beyond the integrability bound p =\nh \u2212 1 (where \"unitary\" bases become singular), it has been called in [24] \"the regular basis\".

Due to the special choice of the\nprefactor in (2.7), the rationality of w(p) (\u03b6, z) implies that f (p) (\u03be, \u03b7) is a polynomial (of order\nnot exceeding 4\u2206p ) also in \u03b7. The list of polynomial solutions of (2.6) reproduces, for I \u2264 k2\n(or, equivalently, p \u2264 h \u2212 1), the ADE classification of the local extensions of the sc\nu(2)k current\nalgebra [25].\n5\n\nThe actions of b1 and b3 coincide, so one deals, effectively, with the braid group B3 .\n\n5\n\n\f(2h\u22121)\n\nBraid invariant polynomial solutions fh\u22121\nhave been explicitly constructed later in [26]\nalso for p = 2h \u2212 1 (corresponding to isospin I = k + 1), for any non-negative integer level.\nThey do not obey the integrability condition, so the corresponding local primary field of integer\nconformal dimension \u22062h\u22121 = h\u22121 should give rise to a non-unitary representation of the sc\nu(2)k\ncurrent algebra. It has been noticed further by A. Nichols [27] that, in fact, for any p = 2(J +1)h\u2212\n(p)\n1 , J = 0, 21 , 1, . . . the (2J + 1)-dimensional subspace of Sp spanned by {fmh\u22121 }2J\nm=0 forms an\nirreducible representation of the braid group under the action defined in (2.8) (the invariant found\nin [26] corresponds to the singlet J = 0).\nWe shall display, as an example, the regular basis for h = 2 , p = 2h \u2212 1 = 3. The general\nformula in [26] for the polynomial invariant reduces in this case to\n(3)\n\nf1 (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7)(\u03b7(1 \u2212 2\u03be) \u2212 \u03be(\u03be \u2212 2)) ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhile the two other regular basis solutions of (2.6) are logarithmic:\n1 (3)\n(3)\nf0 (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u2212 (f1 (\u03be, \u03b7) ln \u03b7 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)2 (\u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03be 2 )) ,\n\u03c0\n(3)\n(3)\nf2 (\u03be, \u03b7) = f0 (1 \u2212 \u03be, 1 \u2212 \u03b7) .\n\u2212i \u03c0\nh\n\n=\nOne can easily check that (2.8) holds in this case with q = e\n(2.9),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0\n\u22121 0\nB1 = \uf8ed i 1 0 \uf8f8 , B2 = \uf8ed 0 1\n\u22121 0 \u22121\n0 0\n\n(2.13)\n\n\u2212i and matrices B1 , B2 as in\n\uf8f6\n\u22121\ni \uf8f8 .\n1\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe structure of the spaces Sp as braid group modules has been studied in full generality\nin [21] and is the following. Let 1 \u2264 r \u2264 h \u2212 1 and N \u2265 1 be both integer; then, all Sr as well\nas SN h are irreducible, while each SN h+r contains an N (h \u2212 r)-dimensional invariant irreducible\nsubmodule SN,h\u2212r such that the corresponding (N + 1)r-dimensional quotient S\u0303N +1,r is also\nirreducible. In other words, we have the following short exact sequence:\n0 \u2192 SN,h\u2212r \u2192 SN h+r \u2192 S\u0303N +1,r \u2192 0 .\n\n(2.15)\n\nHere the submodule is defined as\n\u22121\nSN,h\u2212r = Span { f\u03bc(N h+r) , \u03bc = nh + r , . . . , (n + 1)h \u2212 1 }N\nn=0\n\n(2.16)\n\n(Nichols' series corresponding to S2J+1,1 ), while the subquotient is\nS\u0303N +1,r \u2243 Span { f\u03bd(N h+r) , \u03bd = mh , . . . , mh + r \u2212 1 }N\nm=0 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThese results have been derived in cf. [21] by inspection of the explicit expressions (2.9) for the\nelements of the braid matrices, taking into account Lusztig's formula [28]\n\u0014 \u0015\u0012 \u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1\nM\nMh + \u03b1\n(M\u22121)N h+\u03b1N \u2212\u03b2M\n(2.18)\n= (\u22121)\n\u03b2\nN\nNh + \u03b2\n\u0010 \u0011\ni\u03c0\n\u2208 Z is an ordinary\nvalid for q = e\u00b1 h and M \u2208 Z , N \u2208 Z+ , 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 h \u2212 1, in which M\nN\nbinomial coefficient. As we shall show in the following section, quite a similar, but in a sense dual,\nstructure appears in the Fock space of the WZNW zero modes which can be naturally considered\nas a module over certain \"restricted\" version of Uq sl(2) for the same values of q.\n\n6\n\n\f3 The Fock space of WZNW zero modes as an Uq\nmodule\nThe braiding properties of the regular basis of KZ solutions look quite natural in the framework\nof the canonically quantized WZNW model, see [29, 30] where we have considered the case G =\nSU (n). The chiral WZNW field operator g(x) = {g\u03b1A (x)} can be then written as a sum of tensor\nproducts\nn\nX\ni\nuA\nA, i, \u03b1 = 1, . . . , n\n(3.19)\ng\u03b1A (x) =\ni (x) \u2297 a\u03b1 ,\ni=1\n\nof generalized elementary chiral vertex operators (CVO) and \"zero modes\", respectively. The\n\"full\" two-dimensional model is assumed to be defined on the conformal space-time manifold\nS1 \u00d7 R1 , so the observable 2D field is periodic in the space coordinate, while the chiral fields in\n(3.19) are only quasi-periodic in the corresponding light cone variable x. By construction, the field\ng has a general monodromy, g(x + 2\u03c0) = g(x)M , while the monodromy Mp of u is \"diagonal\";\nin the classical theory, M belongs to the (compact) group G, and Mp is restricted to a maximal\ntorus.\nIt looks now plausible to think of a field-theoretic representation of the operators (3.19) in a\nspace of the type (1.1), with p labeling in the same time the representations of the affine algebra b\ng\n(where g is the Lie algebra of G, in our case, su(n)) at the given level, and those of the corresponding QUEA Uq (g). The action of ui and ai on the corresponding spaces can be described as adding\na box to the i-th row of the Young diagram (the result being zero, if this does not produce another\nsu(n) Young diagram). For the zero modes, this formalism amounts to considering a Fock-type\nrepresentation of the quantum matrix algebra Aq generated by ai\u03b1 and by a commuttative set of\ni\ni\noperators q p\u0302jj+1 , j = 1, 2, . . . n \u2212 1 such that q p\u0302jj+1 ai\u03b1 = ai\u03b1 q p\u0302jj+1 +\u03b4j \u2212\u03b4j+1 , and assuming that\np\u0302jj+1 are diagonalized on Vp , with eigenvalues pjj+1 equal to the corresponding shifted highest\nweights (\u03bbj + 1, where \u03bbj are the Dynkin labels).\nThis idea does not work straightforwardly for the case of interest, when the level k is a non\u03c0\nnegative integer and, accordingly, q = e\u00b1i h , h = k + n is a root of unity. As one might expect,\nthe troubles come when approaching the integrability bound (of the sc\nu(n)k representations); for\nexample, the exchange of two generalized CVO u involves a dynamical R-matrix R(p\u0302) which may\nbe singular on Hp if p does not obey the condition p12 + * * * + pn\u22121n \u2264 h \u2212 1.\nRemarkably however, the exchange of two g is always well defined, being expressed in terms\nof a numerical (Drinfeld-Jimbo) R-matrix; the zero modes a accompanying the CVO \"regularize\"\nthe chiral field operator (3.19). For n = 2, where the label p = p12 takes all positive integer values,\nconstructing primary fields out of g(x), taken as elementary ones, could explain the existence of\nthe regular KZ solutions considered in the previous section.\nThe zero modes ai\u03b1 obey the quadratic exchange relations\nR12 (p\u0302)a2 a1 = a1 a2 R12\n\n(3.20)\n\n(from another point of view, the tensor square of the matrix a intertwines the exchange matrices\nof u(x) and g(x)). Eq. (3.20), together with the exchange relations between a and q p\u0302 and a\ndeterminant condition (det a = [p] in the case n = 2, to which we shall restrain in what follows),\ndefine the matrix algebra Aq . In its Fock representation, a2\u03b1 annihilate the vacuum vector |1, 0i,\n\n7\n\n\fso that the Fock space Fq is spanned by the set of vectors\n|p, mi := (a11 )m (a12 )p\u22121\u2212m |1, 0i\n\n( (q p\u0302 \u2212 q p )|p, mi = 0 ) ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere p = 1, 2, . . . and m = 0, . . . , p \u2212 1. The commutation relations for ai\u03b1 imply\na11 |p, mi = |p + 1, m + 1i ,\n\na12 |p, mi = q m |p + 1, mi ,\n\n1\n2\n\na21 |p, mi = \u2212q [p \u2212 m \u2212 1]|p \u2212 1, mi ,\n1\n\na22 |p, mi = q m\u2212p+ 2 [m]|p \u2212 1, m \u2212 1i .\n\n(3.22)\n\nThe exchange relations involving the Gauss components M\u00b1 of the monodromy M can be interpreted, following the prescriptions of [31], as defining relations for the QUEA Uq = Uq sl(2), so\nthat the entries of M can be expressed in terms of its generators. Further, the exchange relations\nbetween M\u00b1 and the zero modes endow a with the structure of a Uq -tensor operator, which allows\nto write down the relations defining the Uq representation in Fq (under the assumption that the\nvacuum is Uq invariant; \u03b5(X) below is the counit defined in (1.4)):\n(X \u2212 \u03b5(X))|1, 0i = 0 \u2200X \u2208 Uq ,\n\nq H |p, mi = q 2m\u2212p+1 |p, mi ,\n\nE|p, mi = [p \u2212 m \u2212 1] |p, m + 1i ,\n\nF |p, mi = [m] |p, m \u2212 1i .\n\n(3.23)\n\nAs it follows from its definition, the quantum matrix a intertwines the monodromy M and the\ndiagonal one, Mp a = aM . One can explicitly check that\n\u0012 \u2212p\u0302\n\u0013\u0012 1\n\u0013 \u0012 1\n\u0013\u0012 2\n\u0013\nq\n0\na1 a12\na1 a12\n\u03bb F E + q \u2212H\u22121 \u2212\u03bbF q H\u22121\nq\n=\na21 a22\na21 a22\n\u2212\u03bbE\nq H\u22121\n0\nq p\u0302\nwith \u03bb = q \u2212 q \u22121 holds indeed in the Fock space, by using (3.22) and (3.23).\nFor q generic, the subspaces Vp of Fq of vectors with fixed p form p-dimensional irreducible\n\u03c0\nrepresentations of Uq . For q =\u00b1i h , however, they turn into indecomposable, in general, modules of the restricted QUEA U q (1.3). The latter has 2h equivalence classes of r-dimensional\nirreducible representations, Vr\u00b1 for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 h [16], and Vp are partially characterized by the following formula (in which r = 0 is also allowed) which presents them as a sum of vector spaces,\n\u2212\u03b1(N )\n\nVN h+r = (N + 1)Vr\u03b1(N ) + N Vh\u2212r\n\nV0 = V0\u00b1 = {0}\n\n\u03b1(N ) = (\u22121)N ,\n\n,\n\n(3.24)\n\n(the structure extends to an additive Grothendieck group). More precisely, the N + 1 representa\u03b1(N )\ntions of type Vr\nare all submodules of VN h+r , and the N representations of opposite \"parity\"\nappear as subquotients in such a way that, in the natural ordering of the label m, each of them\nis placed between two representations of the first type. Introducing Lusztig's \"divided powers\"\nFs\nEs\n, F (s) = [s]!\n, s = 1, 2, . . . , one easily gets from (3.23)\nE (s) = [s]!\nE (s) |p, mi =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\np\u2212m\u22121\n|p, m + si ,\ns\n\nF (s) |p, mi =\n\nhmi\ns\n\n|p, m \u2212 si ,\n\n(3.25)\n\ndefining thus an extension \u0168q of U q , generated by E (h) and F (h) . As the latter move m by h, they\nconnect all the components of the same parity in (3.24). In effect, the structure of Vp as \u0168q modules becomes similar (not equivalent but, in a sense, dual) to that encountered in the braid group\n\n8\n\n\frepresentations in the previous section. Again, Vr for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 h, as well as VN h , are irreducible,\nbut now each VN h+r contains an (N + 1)r-dimensional invariant irreducible submodule VN +1,r\nsuch that the corresponding N (h \u2212 r)-dimensional quotient \u1e7cN,h\u2212r is also irreducible. This is\nexpressed by the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 VN +1,r \u2192 VN h+r \u2192 \u1e7cN,h\u2212r \u2192 0 ,\n\n(3.26)\n\nin which the subspaces forming submodules and subquotients exchange their places with respect\nto (2.15).\n\n4 Conclusions\nIt is clear that the observed duality of braid group and quantum group representations is not a\ncoincidence but rather an expected feature. However, a true understanding, in the spirit of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig duality, would require additional work (in particular, one has to identify the\nrelevant current algebra representations behind the regular basis of KZ solutions). It would be\ninteresting to study in this approach the \" transmutation\" of symmetry (from kernels to cohomologies of screenings, in the free field setting of [16, 32]) when going back, from the logarithmic\nextension of a known RCFT model, to the RCFT itself.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank I.
