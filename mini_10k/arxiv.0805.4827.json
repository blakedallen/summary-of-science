It exhibits a\nsmall wave vector divergence at the mode-coupling transition.\nPACS numbers: 64.70.pv, 05.70.Ln\n\nIntroduction - It has become clear over the past\ndecade that upon approaching the glass transition, the\nliquid's dynamics not only get slower but also become\nincreasingly heterogeneous [1]. Naturally, one of the very\nfirst questions that arose after the discovery of dynamic\nheterogeneities was that of their spatial extent. Indeed,\nsome of the very first simulational studies of dynamic\nheterogeneities tried to estimate their size and showed\nthat it increases upon cooling [2]. The discovery of growing dynamic heterogeneities posed a challenging problem\nfor the mode-coupling theory [3, 4] of the glass transition. First, according to the standard formulation of this\ntheory [3], the glass transition is supposed to be a small\nspatial scale phenomenon arising from a self-consistent\ncaging of individual particles in their first solvation shells.\nSecond, the mode-coupling theory relies upon a factorization approximation for a four-point dynamic density\ncorrelation function. Thus, it cannot even be expected\nto describe highly non-trivial spatiotemporal dependence\nof various four-point correlation functions that were introduced to monitor dynamic heterogeneities.\nThe above described problem was first addressed by\nBiroli and Bouchaud (BB) [5]. Inspired by an earlier\nstudy [6] of the so-called schematic mode-coupling equations, BB argued, using a field theoretical formulation of\nmany-particle dynamics, that the mode-coupling theory\nshould be understood as a saddle point approximation\nderived from an action functional. Furthermore, they argued that a four-point dynamic density correlation function could be calculated by inverting a second functional\nderivative of the same functional and that this procedure corresponds to a re-summation of ladder diagrams.\nThey analyzed the convergence of the diagrammatic series and showed that their four-point function diverges\nat the transition point of the mode-coupling theory. In\na very interesting later contribution Biroli, Bouchaud,\nMiyazaki and Reichman (BBMR) [7] used a more traditional, projection operator based [3] version of the mode-\n\ncoupling theory and showed that the matrix which determines the convergence of BB's four-point function is\nexactly the same as the matrix which describes long\nwavelength properties of a certain three-point dynamic\nsusceptibility describing the response of the intermediate scattering function to an external potential. Finally,\nin a pair of recent papers [8, 9] Berthier et al. used a\nfield theoretical approach to argue that the most divergent part of the four-point dynamic density correlation\nfunction is given by, roughly speaking, a product of two\nthree-point dynamic susceptibilities. According to Ref.\n[8] these three-point susceptibilities can be expressed in\nterms of ladder diagrams (in qualitative agreement with\nBBMR) and thus the most divergent part of the fourpoint function is represented by, roughly speaking, the\nsum of \"squared ladder\" diagrams [10].\nThe goal of this Letter is to analyze a four-point dynamic density correlation function of a glassy colloidal\nsuspension. The reason for considering a colloidal system is twofold. First, experiments provide a wealth of\ninformation about the motion of individual colloidal particles and thus enable detailed tests of various theoretical predictions. Second, the simplest model of a colloidal\nsuspension, a system of interacting Brownian particles, is\ntechnically simpler to study than a simple fluid. To analyze the four-point function we will use a recently derived\n[11] diagrammatic formulation of the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles. This formulation can use the\nsame tools, e.g. re-summations of classes of diagrams, as\na field theory based approach. It is, however, closer to\nthe standard, projection operator based derivation of the\nmode-coupling theory.\nIn contrast to BB, we focus on singly connected diagrams, i.e. diagrams which separate into two disconnected components upon cutting through a single propagator. We will show that a sum of such diagrams results\nin a contribution to the four-point correlation function\nthat diverges at the transition point of the mode-coupling\n\n\f2\ntheory. The structure of this contribution is very similar\nto the structure of the most divergent part of the fourpoint function obtained by Berthier et al. [8, 12].\nSince the derivation of the main result is rather tedious,\nwe will first define our four-point function and present the\nmain result. We will outline the derivation of this result\nin the latter part of this Letter.\nFour-point correlation function - A number of different functions have been introduced to monitor dynamic\nheterogeneities [13]. In particular, two recent studies [14,\n15, 16] used N e\u2212ik*(r1 (t)\u2212r1 ) eik*(r2 (t)\u2212r2 ) \u03b4(r \u2212 r12 ) ,\nwhere ri (t) denotes the position of particle i at time t,\nri (0) \u2261 ri , r12 = r1 \u2212r2 , and N is the number of particles.\nThis function quantifies correlations between evolutions\nof two particles that were initially separated by |r|. Its\nFourier transform with respect to r can be written as\nN e\u2212ik*(r1 (t)\u2212r2 (t)) ei(k\u2212q)*r12 . In this work, we consider\na collective version of the latter expression,\n1\nhn2 (k, \u2212k; t)n\u22172 (k \u2212 q, \u2212k + q)i ,\nN\n\nS4 (k; q; t) =\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n2 (k1 , k2 ; t) denotes a projected two-particle density [17],\nX\ne\u2212ik1 *ri (t)\u2212ik2 *rj (t) .\nn2 (k1 , k2 ; t) = (1 \u2212 P0 \u2212 P1 )\ni,j\n\n(2)\nIn Eq. (2), P0 and P1 are projection operators onto the\nzero-particle and one-particle density, respectively [11].\nIn the following, we will often use an abbreviated notation and, e.g., write n2 (k1 , k2 ; t) as n2 (1, 2; t) or as n2 (t);\nin addition, n2 (t = 0) \u2261 n2 .\nThe projection operators in Eq. (2) remove a nonzero average value and a non-vanishing projection onto\nthe one-particle density. The terms projected out do not\ncontribute to the divergent part of S4 . Moreover, consistent usage of projected many-particle densities analogous\nto n2 has important technical advantages [11, 18]. In particular, bare inter-particle interactions are automatically\nrenormalized by equilibrium correlation functions.\n\nt\n\nContribution to S4 due to singly connected diagrams\n- In this work we focus on the diagrams which separate\ninto two disconnected components upon cutting a single\nbond, with each component containing at least a single\nline of bonds from the initial time 0 to the final time t (the\nprecise correspondence between S4 and the diagrams will\nbe detailed below). The simplest diagram of this type\nis shown on the left in Fig. 1. In this diagram, bond\nrepresents a bare propagator and vertices , and\nrepresent the left and right vertices, respectively [11].\nUpon a re-summation, the bare singly connected diagram\non the left in Fig. 1 is replaced by the diagram on the\nright of this figure. The latter diagram involves two new\nfunctions, closely related to the three-point susceptibility\nof BBMR, which are represented by\nand\n,\n.\nand full propagator represented by\n\nFIG. 1: Upon re-summation the simplest bare singly connected diagram on the left is replaced by a renormalized diagram on the right.\n\nThe main result of this note is the following formula\nfor the part of S4 which becomes divergent at the modecoupling transition; this formula results from an approximate re-summation indicated in Fig. 1:\n2\nS4 (k; q; t) =\nnS(q)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 2\n\u03c7 (\u2212k; t; \u2212\u03c9)\n2\u03c0 \u2212q\n\n\u00d7G(q; \u03c9)\u03c71\u2212q (k; t; \u03c9)\n\nHere G(q; \u03c9)\nR is a Fourier transform of the full propagator,\nG(q; \u03c9) = dtei\u03c9t G(q; t), and G(k; t) is defined in terms\nof the intermediate scattering function F (k; t), G(k; t) =\n\u03b8(t)F (k; t)/S(k). Furthermore, in Eq. (3) \u03c71q (k; t; \u03c9) and\n\u03c72q (k; t; \u03c9) are three-point functions. They are related by\n\u03c72q (k; t; \u2212\u03c9) = e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c71q (k \u2212 q; t; \u03c9). Function \u03c71q (k; t; \u03c9)\nsatisfies the following equation of motion:\n\n\u0001 \u2202\u03c71q (k; t\u2032 ; \u03c9) D0 k 2 1\n+\n\u03c7 (k; t; \u03c9) +\n(k; t \u2212 t )\n\u2202t\u2032\nS(k) q\n\nt\n\ndk\u2032 nD0 k\n(2\u03c0)3 |k + q|\n0\n0\n\u2202F (|k + q|; t\u2032 )\n= Sq (k; t; \u03c9)\n\u00d7vk (k\u2032 , k \u2212 k\u2032 )\u03c71q (k\u2032 ; t \u2212 t\u2032 ; \u03c9)F (|k \u2212 k\u2032 |; t \u2212 t\u2032 )vk+q (k\u2032 + q, k \u2212 k\u2032 )\n\u2202t\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndt \u03b4(t \u2212 t ) + M\n\nirr\n\n\u2032\n\nIn Eq. (4), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of an isolated\nBrownian particle, S(k) denotes the structure factor, n is\nthe density and M irr (k; t) is the irreducible [19] memory\nfunction. Moreover, vk (k1 , k2 ) = k\u0302 * (c(k1 )k1 + c(k2 )k2 )\nwhere c(k) is the Fourier transform of the direct cor-\n\n(3)\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n(4)\n\nrelation function. The source term at the right-handside of Eq. (4), Sq (k; t; \u03c9), can be expressed in terms\nof the intermediate scattering function and equilibrium\ncorrelation functions. This term is regular and finite in\nthe q \u2192 0 and \u03c9 \u2192 0 limits, limq\u21920;\u03c9\u21920 Sq (k; t; \u03c9) =\n\n\f3\nnD0 S(0)k 2 c(k)F (k; t).\nAs explained below, the re-summation leading to Eqs.\n(3-4) involves an approximation which is similar to the\napproximation used in the diagrammatic derivation of\nthe mode-coupling theory [11]. Thus, to be consistent we replace the full G, F and M irr in Eqs. (3-4)\nby their approximate forms calculated using the modecoupling equations. Specifically, we assume the standard\nmode-coupling relation which expresses\nM irr in terms\nR\nirr\n\u2032\nof F 's, M (k; t) = (nD0 /2) (dk /(2\u03c0)3 )vk2 (k\u2032 , k \u2212\nk\u2032 )F (k \u2032 ; t)F (|k \u2212 k\u2032 |; t).\nAt this point we note that evolution operator on the\nleft-hand-side of Eq. (4) with the mode-coupling expression for M irr is exactly the same as the overdamped\nversion of the evolution operator derived by BBMR for\ntheir three-point susceptibility. Indeed, the only difference between Eq. (4) and the overdamped version of the\nequation of motion (2) of Ref. [7] is the source term.\nMoreover, BBMR emphasized that all of their qualitative conclusions are independent of the precise structure\nof the source term. Thus, we conjecture that our threepoint functions \u03c71q (k; t; \u03c9) and \u03c72q (k; t; \u03c9) have the same\nscaling behavior as \u03c7q (k; t) of Ref. [7]. In particular,\nthese functions exhibit a small wave vector divergence\nupon approaching the mode-coupling transition.\nFurthermore, we note that Eq. (3) has the same general structure as the formula derived by Berthier et al.\n(see Eq. (56) of Ref. [8]) [20]. Thus, we are lead to\nthe same conclusion: the divergence of the four-point\ndynamic density correlation function is intimately connected to and in fact driven by the divergence of the\nthree-point function.\nDerivation - We consider the time-dependent correlation function of the projected two-particle density,\nhn2 (1, 2; t)n\u22172 (3, 4)i. For a specific set of wave vectors this function is proportional to S4 : in the thermodynamic limit we get hn2 (k, \u2212k; t)n\u22172 (k \u2212 q, k\u2032 )i =\nn2 S4 (k; q; t)(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k + q \u2212 k\u2032 ).\nFollowing Ref. [11], it is possible to derive a hierarchy\nof equations describing the time evolution of hn2 (t)n\u22172 i.\nThis hierarchy can be rewritten as a hierarchy of integral\nequations which can be solved by iteration. The solution\ncan be represented in terms of diagrams consisting of\nthe bare propagator, G0 (k; t) = \u03b8(t) exp(\u2212D0 k 2 t/S(k)),\n, and three vertices, the left vertex,\nrepresented by\nV12 , represented by , the right vertex, V21 , represented\nby , and the four-leg vertex, V22 , represented by .\nThe vertices represent renormalized inter-particle interactions; they involve the direct correlation function and\nthe structure factor rather than a bare interaction potential (see Eqs.

Here,\nwe only consider singly connected diagrams. A singly\nconnected diagram is a connected diagram which sepa-\n\nk1\n\nk1\n\nk3\n+\n\nk2\n\nk4\n\nk1\n\nk3\n\nk3\n+ ...\n\n+\nk2\n\nk4\n\nk2\n\nk4\n\nFIG. 2: The first few diagrams in the diagrammatic series for\nhn2 (k1 , k2 ; t)n\u22172 (k3 , k4 )iscn .\n\nrates into two disconnected components upon cutting a\nsingle G0 bond, with each component containing at least\na single line of bonds from the initial time 0 to the final\ntime t. The first few such diagrams are shown in Fig. 2.\nIt is convenient to formulate the diagrammatic expansion for the singly connected part of hn2 (t)n\u22172 i divided by\nn2 S(3)S(4). For brevity, we will denote this function by\nhn2 (t)n\u22172 iscn . In the diagrams contributing to it, we refer\nto the leftmost and the rightmost bare propagators as\nthe left roots and the right roots, respectively, and to the\nother bare propagators as bonds. The roots are labeled\nby wave vectors and the bonds are unlabeled. It can be\nshowed that hn2 (t)n\u22172 iscn is the sum of all topologically\ndifferent [11], singly connected diagrams with two left\nroots, two right roots, G0 bonds, and V12 , V21 , and V22\nvertices. To evaluate a diagram one assigns wave vectors\nto bonds and integrates over these wave vectors (with a\n(2\u03c0)\u22123 factor for each integration), integrates over all intermediate times, and divides the result by a symmetry\nnumber [11] of the diagram; diagrams with odd and even\nnumbers of V22 vertices contribute with overall negative\nand positive sings, respectively.\nTo re-sum singly connected diagrams we first note that\nthe sum of all the \"connecting parts\" in diagrams in Fig.\n2 gives the full propagator G(q; t) [21]. The sums of the\ntwo remaining parts of singly connected diagrams are related to each other by a symmetry operation and thus\nwe have to evaluate only one of them.\nWe define X31 (k1 , q; k3 ; t, t\u2032 ) as the sum of all connected, topologically different diagrams with one left\nroot, one right root and one left side root (the left side\nroot originates from a left \"dangling\" end of the right\nvertex, V21 , or from a left \"dangling\" end of four-leg vertex, V22 ). The first few diagrams contributing to X31 are\nshown in Fig. 3.\nThe last step in the re-summation is the derivation\nof a self-consistent equation for function X31 shown in\nFig. 4. In this figure,\nrepresents function X31 , a\nrepresents the full propagator G(k; t)\nthick bond\nand\nrepresents the reducible memory matrix [11].\nHere, we will only argue that equation in Fig. 4 is plausible [21]. Re-summation of diagrams similar to the first\nand second diagrams in Fig. 3 results in first diagram at\nthe right-hand-side of diagrammatic equation in Fig. 4.\nRe-summation of diagrams similar to the third diagram\nin Fig. 3 results in the second diagram at the right-handside of Fig. 4.

Thus, the four-point correlation function of a glassy\ncolloidal suspension exhibits a small wave vector divergence. In addition, we have derived an explicit formula\nfor the dominant part of the four-point function.\n\nk2\n\n\u2212\n\n+\nq, t'\n\nq, t'\nk1\n\nk2\n\n\u2212\nq, t'\nk2\n\nk1\n+\nq, t'\n\nFIG. 4: Diagrammatic self-consistent equation for function\nX31 (k1 , q; k2 ; t, t\u2032 ).\n\nfourth diagram in Fig. 3 results in the third diagram\nat the right-hand-side of Fig. 4. Re-summations of diagrams similar to the fifth and sixth diagrams in Fig. 3\nresult in the fourth and fifth diagrams at the right-handside of Fig. 4, respectively. Diagrams similar to the\nseventh diagram in Fig. 3 are neglected. As mentioned\nabove, diagrams neglected in our re-summation resemble diagrams which are neglected in the approximation\nleading to the mode-coupling expression for M irr [11].\nParenthetically, diagrams resulting from the selfconsistent equation showed in Fig. 4 could be written as\nladder diagrams. However, these ladder diagrams would\nbe quite unusual in that their beams would correspond\nto time running in opposite directions.\nNext, we define three-point function \u03c71q (k; t; t\u2032 ) in\nterms of X31 : X31 (k, q; k\u2032 ; t, t\u2032 ) = \u03c71q (k; t; t\u2032 )(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k +\nq\u2212 k\u2032 )/S(k \u2032 ). We introduce its frequency dependent verRt\n\u2032\nsion \u03c71q (k; t; \u03c9) = 0 dt\u2032 ei\u03c9t \u03c71q (k; t; t\u2032 ). It can be showed\nthat the self-consistent equation for X31 showed in Fig.\n4 is equivalent to the equation of motion (4) for the frequency dependent function \u03c71q (k; t; \u03c9). A symmetry relation mentioned above results in the relation between\n\u03c71 and \u03c72 given below Eq. (3). Finally, we express the\nsum of singly connected diagrams in terms of G, \u03c71 and\n\u03c72 , and we get expression (3) for the part of S4 which ex-\n\n[1] For reviews of experimental evidence of dynamic heterogeneities see, e.g. M.
