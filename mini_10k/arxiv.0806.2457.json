Let R be the scalar curvature\nand let\nZ\n1\n(1.1)\nk(r, x) =\nR\nVx (r) Bx (r)\n1\n\nResearch partially supported by NSERC grant no. #327637-06.\nResearch partially supported by Earmarked Grant of Hong\n#CUHK403005.\n2\n\n1\n\nKong\n\n\f2\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nbe the average of the scalar curvature over the geodesic ball with radius\nr and center at x. In [11], [12] and [13] the authors obtained, among\nother things, the following uniformization results:\n(1) If k(r, x) \u2264 C/(1 + r 2 ) for some C for all r and x, then the\nuniversal cover of M is biholomorphic to Cn .\n(2) Under a weaker assumption that k(r, x) \u2264 C/(1 + r) for some C\nfor all r and x, the universal cover of M is homeomorphic to R2n and\nis biholomorphic a pseudoconvex domain in Cn .\nThe results support the following conjecture due to Yau [33]: If\n(M, g) has positive holomorphic bisectional curvature then M is biholomorphic to Cn .\nIn this paper we want to discuss the structure of M itself. In light of\nthe above results, a reasonable approach is as follows. First one studies\nmore closely the structure of the universal cover M\u0303 . Then one would\nlike to study properties of the first fundamental group, and hopefully\nthese together will provide information about the structure of M. As\nin the previous works, we will study the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow equation on\n(M, g):\n\u2202gi\uf6be\u0304\n= \u2212Ri\uf6be\u0304 .\n\u2202t\nBy the works [26] and [28] of Shi, the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow has a long time\nsolution g(t) with uniformly bounded curvature under assumption (2)\n(and hence (1)) above. By the splitting result of Cao [7], (M\u0303, e\ng (t)),\nthe pull back of g(t) to the universal cover M\u0303 , splits for all t > 0 as\nM\u0303 = Ck \u00d7 \u00d1 and e\ng (t) = ge \u00d7 h(t) where ge is the standard metric\nk\non C and h(t) has nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature and\npositive Ricci curvature. Hence we will begin our studies with long\ntime solutions (M, g(t)) to K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow where g(t) has uniformly\nbounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature and positive\nRicci curvature. We will prove that:\nIf at some point p \u2208 M, the eigenvalues of Ric(p, t) are uniformly\npinched (i.e. the smallest eigenvalue of Ric(p, t) is at least C times the\nlargest eigenvalue for some C > 0 independent of t), then M is simply\nconnected and is in fact biholomorphic to a pseudoconvex domain in\nCn .\nSee Theorems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. A particular case is when (M, g) has\naverage quadratic curvature decay and positive Ricci in which case it is\nshown in Corollary 2.1 that M is biholomrophic to Cn . This generalizes\nprevious results in [12] where the same result, in particular Corollary\n2.1, is proved assuming in addition either that (1.2) has an eternal\nsolution (i.e. g(t) exists for \u2212\u221e < t < \u221e) or that tR is uniformly\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n3\n\nbounded in spacetime. Note that either conditions will imply that\neigenvalues of Ric(p, t) are uniformly pinched, see [12] for example.\nMore generally, if we only assume the positive eigenvalues of Ric(p, t)\nare uniformly pinched, then using the above result on simple connectedness, we prove that:\nM is a holomorphic and Riemannian fiber bundle over Ck /\u0393 where\n\u0393 is a discrete subgroup of the holomorphic isometry group of Ck , with\nfiber either Cn\u2212k or a pseudoconvex domain in Cn\u2212k .\nSee Theorem 3.1. In particular, the fiber is Cn\u2212k when (M, g) has average quadratic curvature decay, which we show in Corollary 3.1. Similar results under different conditions have been obtained by Takayama\n[30], Ni-Tam and Zheng [25].\nOur results are related to the second part of Yau's conjecture in [33]:\nIf the holomorphic bisectional curvature is only non-negative then M\nis biholomorphic to a complex vector bundle over a compact Hermitian\nsymmetric space. In fact, we prove that if n \u2212 k = 1 in the above\nsituation, then M is actually a line bundle over Ck /\u0393. In order to\nprove this, we have to study more carefully about the isometry group\nof a complete noncompact K\u00e4hler manifold (M, g) with nonnegative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature and positive Ricci curvature. We\nprove that if there is a long time solution g(t) to K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\nwith uniformly bounded non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature and positive uniformly pinched Ricci curvature, then any finite set\nof isometries of M has a fixed point. Under the stronger assumption\nthat (1.2) has an eternal solution or tR(p, t) is uniformly bounded for\nall time, then one can prove the stronger result that there is a fixed\npoint for all isometries of (M, g). See Theorems 2.4 and 2.5. One\nmight want to compare this with a theorem of Cartan which says that\na compact subgroup of isometries of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold has\na fixed point.\nA special case of the above is when g(t) is actually a gradient K\u00e4hlerRicci soliton. Namely, there is a real valued function f with fij = 0\nsuch that Ri\uf6be\u0304 = fi\uf6be\u0304 (steady type) or after rescaling \u2212Ri\uf6be\u0304 + gi\uf6be\u0304 = fi\uf6be\u0304\n(expanding type). In the case of expanding type, it is known that M\nis biholomorphic to Cn by [10]. For the case of steady type, under\nan additional assumption that the scalar curvature attains its maximum at some point, we prove that in most cases, M is a holomorphic\nvector bundle or Ck /\u0393. More precisely, we prove that this is the case\nif the scalar curvature R is maximal at p \u2208 M say, and the positive\n\n\f4\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\neigenvalues \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbl of Ric at p satisfy the Diophantine condition\nl\nX\ni=1\n\nmi \u03bbi 6= \u03bbj\n\nP\nfor all j and for all nonnegative integers mi such that li=1 mi \u2265 2.\nSee Theorem 4.1. The proof relies on the result of Bryant [2] on the\nexistence of Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. This is related to a result of Yang\n[32]: Suppose M is a noncompact K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with nonnegative Ricci curvature such that its scalar curvature attains a positive\nmaximum at a compact complex submanifold K with codimension 1\nand the Ricci curvature is positive away from K, then M is a holomorphic line bundle over K. proves that\nWe now describe the organization of the paper. In \u00a72 we study long\ntime solutions to K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow with bounded non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature and positive Ricci curvature. We will\nprove the existence of gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton limits and consequences of this concerning the injectivity radius along the flow and the\nsimple connectedness of M. We will also prove results on the existence\nof fixed point of isometries. In \u00a73 will prove the fiber bundle structure\nand line bundle of M. Finally, in \u00a74 we prove vector bundle structure on gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci solitons. We will also prove a result on\nthe volume growth of expanding gradient Ricci solitons in this section\nwhich is related to the work of Ni [24] 1.\n2. long time solutions and local limits\nIn this section we study limits of long time solutions of the K\u00e4hlerRicci flow (2.1) on complete noncompact K\u00e4hler manifolds with uniformly bounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature and\npositive Ricci curvature. We will investigate when such a solution subconverges, after rescaling, to a gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton limit, and\nwe will derive a number of consequences from this. In Corollary 2.1\nwe treat the particular case of a complete non-compact K\u00e4hler manifold having bounded non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature\nand positive Ricci curvature which decays quadratically in the average\nsense. Our study of the limiting behavior of K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow in this\nsection can be viewed as an extension of that in [11] and [12].

Let (M, g) be a complete K\u00e4hler manifold. Let p \u2208 M\nand r0 > 0. Suppose |Rm(g)| + |\u2207Rm(g)| \u2264 c for some c on B(p, r0 ).\nThen there exist r > 0 and a constant C > 0 depending only on r0 , c\nand n, and a holomorphic map\n(2.5)\n\n\u03a6 : D(r) \u2192 M\n\nwith the following properties:\n(i) \u03a6 is a local biholomorphism from D(r) \u2282 Cn onto its image,\n(ii) \u03a6(0) = p,\n(iii) \u03a6\u2217 (g)(0) = ge ,\n(iv) C1 ge \u2264 \u03a6\u2217 (gi ) \u2264 Cge in D(r),\nwhere ge is the standard metric on Cn .\nWe may now state our first\nTheorem 2.1. Suppose that at some p \u2208 M we have Ric(p, t) \u2265\ncg(p, t) for all t for some c > 0. Then the following are true.\n(i) The injectivity radius of g(t) at p satisfies injt (p) \u2265 a for some\na > 0 for all t.\n(ii) M n is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space and is biholomorphic to a pseudoconvex domain in Cn .\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n7\n\n(iii) For any ti \u2192 \u221e we can find a subsequence tik such that (M, g(t+\ntik ), p) converges to a complete eternal solution (M\u221e , g\u221e (t), o)\nof (2.1) with positive Ricci curvature and bounded non-negative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature, and M\u221e is biholomorphic to\nCn .\n(iv) For any ti \u2192 \u221e, there exist a subsequence tik and sik \u2265 tik such\nthat (M, g(sik ), p) converges to a steady gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci\nsoliton with positive Ricci curvature and bounded nonnegative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature which is biholomprhic to Cn .\nProof. Assume (i) is true. Since the curvature, and its covariant derivatives, of g(t) are uniformly bounded by [28] for t \u2265 1, for each t \u2265 1\nthere is a biholomorphism \u03a6t from D(r) \u2192 M satisfying the conditions\nin Lemma 2.2 with r and C being independent of t. Since Ric > 0 for\nall t, it is easy to see that \u03a6t (D(r)) exhausts M as t \u2192 \u221e by the\neigenvalue inequality for Rc(t) in [13] (Theorem 6.1). Hence M is\nhomeomorphic to the Euclidean space by [1]. This proves the first part\nof (ii). The second part of (ii) then follows from Theorem 1.2 in [13].\n(iii) follows from (i), the standard result on compactness of solutions\nof Ricci flow [22] and Theorem 1.4 in [12].\n(iv) will follows from (i) and the content in the proof of (i).\nIt remains to prove (i). Suppose there exist ti \u2192 \u221e such that\nlimi\u2192\u221e injti (p) = 0. Since the curvature are uniformly bounded in\nspacetime, for any positive integer k \u2265 1 there is a positive constant\nC1 which is independent of i, but possibly depending on k, such that\n1\ng(t) \u2264 g(ti ) \u2264 C1 g(t)\nC1\nand for any t \u2208 [ti , ti + k]. By volume comparison and [17] on the\ninjectivity radius bound we have:\nlim\n\nsup\n\ni\u2192\u221e t\u2208[t ,t +k]\ni i\n\ninjt (p) = 0\n\nfor any k. On the other hand, since the scalar curvature of g(t) are\nuniformly bounded, for any i, there exists si \u2208 [ti , ti + k] such that the\n\u2202\nscalar curvature \u2202t\nR(p, t)|t=si \u2264 C2 /k where C2 = 2 supt R(p, t). By\npassing to a subsequence still denoted by ti , we can find ki \u2192 \u221e and\nsi \u2208 [ti , ti + ki ] such that\n\u2202\n(2.6)\nlim injsi (p) = 0, lim R(p, t)|t=si = 0.\ni\u2192\u221e\ni\u2192\u221e \u2202t\nBy Lemma 2.2, there is r > 0 and C3 > 0 independent of i such\nthat for each i, there exists a a holomorphic map \u03a6i : D(r) \u2192 M\ncorresponding to the metric g(si ) satisfying the conditions in the lemma\n\n\f8\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nwith C = C3 in property (iv) in the lemma. Now by considering\nthe sequence (D(r), gi (s) = \u03a6\u2217i g(si + s)), we may then obtain a local\nsubsequence limit solution (D(r), h(z, t)) to (2.1) on an eternal time\n\u2202\nRh (0, 0) = 0 where Rh is the scalar curvature\ninterval and satisfying \u2202t\nof h. By Theorem 2.1 in [12] we find that (D(r), h(0)) is a local steady\ngradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with positive Ricci curvature centered at\nthe origin. Namely, there is a real valued function f on D(r) such that\nRi\uf6be\u0304h = fi\uf6be\u0304 and fij = 0 in D(r), where Ri\uf6be\u0304h is the Ricci curvature of h(0).\nThus Z i = f i is a holomorphic vector field, and it can be shown that\nthe gradient of f is zero at the origin (see [12] for example), which is an\nisolated zero because fi\uf6be\u0304 = Ri\uf6be\u0304h > 0. In fact by its construction in [12,\n\u00a72] and [6], there exists 0 < r1 < r such that Z is the unique solution\nof the equation\n(2.7)\n\nR,i + Rij\u0304 Z j\u0304 = 0\n\nin D(r1 ) relative to the metric h(0).\nNote that (2.7) has a unique solution Z \u2208 T (0,1) on any K\u00e4hler\nmanifold having positive Ricci curvature. By our assumptions on the\npositivity of Ricci curvature, we may then let W (i) \u2208 T (0,1) M be the\nunique solutions to (2.7) on (M, g(si )) for any k. In particular, for\nany i as \u03a6i is a local biholomorphism, V (i) = (\u03a6i )\u2217 (W (i)) is a smooth\n(0, 1) vector field in D(r). By the definition of g(si ), V (i) is just the\nunique solution of (2.7) in D(r1 ) relative to the metric (\u03a6i )\u2217 (g(si )). By\nuniqueness and the fact that (\u03a6i )\u2217 (g(si )) \u2192 h, we conclude that:\nV (i) converges to Z uniformly on compact sets in D(r1 ) in the C \u221e\ntopology.\nIt is easy to see that the integral curves of \u2212Z in D(r) will converge\nto the origin. Since V (i) converge to Z, one expects the integral curves\nof V (i) have similar behaviors if i is large. In fact, In real coordinates\nx\u03b1 of D, the integral curves of \u2212Z are given by the following ODE\n(2.8)\n\nx\u2032\u03b1 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 x\u03b1 + F\u03b1 (x)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u03b1 \u2265 c > 0 are the positive eigenvalues of Ri\uf6be\u0304h at the origin,\n|F (x)| = (|x|2 ) and |dF (x)| = O(|x|). On the other hand, for any \u01eb > 0\nthere exists i0 and 0 < r1 < r such that the integral curves of V (i) for\ni \u2265 i0 is given by\n(2.9)\n\nx\u2032\u03b1 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 x\u03b1 + Gi\u03b1 (x)\n\n|Gi \u2212 F | + |dGi \u2212 dF | \u2264 \u01eb in D(r1 ).\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n9\n\nFix r1 > r2 > 0 and suppose x(\u03c4 ) is an integral curve of \u2212V (i) in\nD(r). Then\nd 2\n|x| \u2264 \u22122c|x|2 + |Gi (x)| |x|\nd\u03c4\n\u2264 \u22122c|x|2 + \u01eb|x| + C4 |x|3\n(2.10)\n3\n\u2264 \u2212 c|x|2 + \u01eb|x|\n2\nwhere C4 depends only on F , provided r2 < 2Cc 3 and |x| \u2264 r2 . Fix r2\nsatisfying these conditions. Then if r22 \u2264 |x| \u2264 r2 we have\n\n3\n2\u01eb\nd 2\n|x| \u2264 \u2212 c|x|2 + |x|2 < 0\nd\u03c4\n2\nr\nif \u01eb > 0 is small enough. Choose such an \u01eb. Hence for i \u2265 i0 large\nenough any integral curve of V (i) starting in D(r2 ) will stay inside\nD(r2 ).\nNow Let x(\u03c4 ) and y(\u03c4 ) be two integral curves of V (i) inside D(r2 ).\nThen\n(2.12)\nX\nX\n\u0001\nd\n|x \u2212 y|2 = \u22122\n\u03bb\u03b1 (x\u03b1 \u2212 y\u03b1 )2 +\nGi\u03b1 (x) \u2212 Gi\u03b1 (y) (x\u03b1 \u2212 y\u03b1 )\ndt\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nX\n2\ni\n\u2264 \u22122c|x \u2212 y| +\n||dG (z\u03b1 )|| (x\u03b1 \u2212 y\u03b1 )2\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u03b1\n\n2\n\n\u2264 \u22122c|x \u2212 y| + \u01eb|x \u2212 y|2 +\n\u2264 \u2212c|x \u2212 y|\n\n2\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n||dF (z\u03b1 )|| (x\u03b1 \u2212 y\u03b1 )2\n\nfor some z\u03b1 inside D(r2 ), provided r2 and \u01eb are sufficiently small, both\ndepending only on the constant c. Hence\n(2.13)\n\n|x \u2212 y|2 (\u03c4 ) \u2264 exp(\u2212c\u03c4 )|x \u2212 y|2(0) \u2264 4r 2 exp(\u2212c\u03c4 ).\n\nIn particular, if x(\u03c4 ) is an integral curve, and if \u03c42 > \u03c41 > 0, then\ny(\u03c4 ) = x(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c42 + \u03c4 ) is also an integral curve. Hence |x(\u03c41 ) \u2212 x(\u03c42 )|2 \u2264\n4r 2 exp(\u2212c\u03c41 ). Hence x(\u03c4 ) will converge to a point x0 \u2208 D(r2 ), and by\n(2.13), we see that any set in D(r2 ) will contract to x0 along integral\ncurves. In fact, x0 \u2208 D( r22 ) by (2.11). Moreover, x0 is a fixed point of\nV (i).\nWe now claim that \u03a6i is injective on D(r2 ) for i \u2265 i0 . Assume this\nis not the case and that for some z1 6= z2 \u2208 D(r2 ) we have \u03a6i (z1 ) =\n\u03a6i (z2 ) = q \u2208 M. Let \u03b31 and \u03b32 be two integral curves for V (i) starting\nat z1 and z2 respectively. Then by the construction of V (i), \u03a6i (\u03b31 )\n\n\f10\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nand \u03a6i (\u03b32 ) are integral curves for W (i) starting from q. Hence by the\nuniqueness of integral curves we must have \u03a6i (\u03b31 (\u03c4 )) = \u03a6i (\u03b32 (\u03c4 )) for\nall \u03c4 . On the other hand, for all \u03c4 , we have \u03b31 (\u03c4 ) 6= \u03b32 (\u03c4 ) also by\nuniqueness of integral curves. But \u03b31 (\u03c4 ) and \u03b32 (\u03c4 ) both converge to a\nx0 \u2208 D\u0304(r2 ). It is readily seen that these facts contradict the fact that\n\u03a6i is a biholomorphism in some neighborhood of x0 . Thus we have\nshown that \u03a6i is injective on D(r2 ) for all i \u2265 i0 .\nNow It is easy to see that \u03a6i (D(r2 )) is contained in some geodesic\nball Bsi (p, r3 ) for some r3 independent of i. Thus by the injectivity of\n\u03a6i shown above, and by the fact that \u03a6\u2217i (g(si )) is uniformly equivalent\nto the Euclidean metric by Lemma 2.2, it is easy to see that there exists\nb > 0 such that for i \u2265 i0 large enough Bsi (p, r3 ) has volume bounded\nbelow by b. By the result of Cheeger-Gromov-Taylor [17], injsi (p) must\nbe uniformly bounded away from zero. But this contradicts our assumption that injsi (p) \u2192 0. This completes the proof of the theorem\nby contradiction.\n\u0003\nNext we consider the case that tR(p, t) is uniformly bounded.\nTheorem 2.2. Suppose that at some p \u2208 M we have tR(p, t) \u2264 c for\nall t and some c > 0. Then the following are true.\n1\n\n(i) The injectivity radius of g(t) at p satisfies injt (p) \u2265 at 2 for\nsome a > 0 for all t.\n(ii) M n is biholomorphic to Cn .\n(iii) Let g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (s) = e\u2212s g(es ). Then for any si \u2192 \u221e we can find a subsequence sik such that (M, g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (sik ), p) converges to an expanding gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with positive Ricci curvature\nwhich is biholmorphic to Cn .\nWe will need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.3. With the same assumptions as in Theorem 2.2, for any\n\u03c1 > 0 and integer k \u2265 0, there is a constant C such that\n||\u2207k Rm(x, t)||2t \u2264\n\nC\n\nt2+k\n\u221a\nfor all x \u2208 Bt (p, \u03c1 t) and for all t > 0, where \u2207 and the norm are\ntaken with respect to g(t).\nProof. By the assumptions and Lemma 2.1, there exists a constant C1\nsuch that for all T > 0 and r > 0,\n(2.14)\n\nr2\nR(x, t)\n\u2264 C1 exp( )\nR(p, 3T )\n4\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n11\n\n\u221a\nfor all x \u2208 BT (p, r T ) and T \u2264 t \u2264 2T . Now consider the metrics\n\u011d(s) = T1 g(T + sT ). Then \u011d satisifies the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow equation\nwith nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature.

To prove (i), let g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 as in (iii). Then g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (s) solves\nthe normalized K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow equation:\n\n\u2202e\ngi\uf6be\u0304\nei\uf6be\u0304 \u2212 e\n= \u2212R\ngi\uf6be\u0304\n\u2202t\non M \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). By Lemma 2.3, the fact that g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 has positive Ricci\ncurvature, and the fact that the eigenvalues of Ric are nondecreasing by\nTheorem 6.1 in [13], we can proceed exactly as in the proof of Theorem\n2.1(i) to show that the injectivity radius of g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (s) at p is uniformly\nbounded below away from zero. Rescaling back to g(t), we see that (i)\nis true. Note that here we use the fact that if we take a limit along a\nsequence si as in the proof of Theorem 2.1(i), then in the limit metric,\nthe scalar curvature at the origin is constant in time.\n(2.17)\n\n\f12\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nUsing Lemma 2.3 and (i), the proof of Theorem 1.1 in [11] can be\ncarried over to prove that M is biholomorphic to Cn . 2\nSince g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (s) is decreasing, for any \u03c1 > 0 and s0 \u2265 0, the curvature\ntogether with its derivatives are uniformly bounded on Bs0 (p, \u03c1) for\nall s \u2265 s0 . Combining with (i), one can apply the proof of the local\nversion [19, Corollary 3.18] of compactness of solutions of Hamilton\n[22], to conclude that for any si \u2192 \u221e we can find a subsequence sik\nsuch that (M, g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (s + sik ), p) converges to a complete eternal solution\nof (2.17) which is in fact an expanding gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton\nwith positive Ricci curvature and nonnegative holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature. The fact that the limit solution is an expanding gradient\nK\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton can be proved as in [12, \u00a72]. The fact that the\nlimiting manifold is biholomorphic to Cn follows from [10, 2].\n\u0003\nRemark 2.1. Theorem 2.2 was proved by the authors in [12] under\nthe stronger assumption that tR(p, t) is uniformly bounded for all t \u2265\n0 independently of p. In particular, it was proved there that M is\nbiholomorphic to Cn . We point out that the injectivity radius bound\nin Theorem 2.2 (i) allows a direct application of the methods in [11],\nand thus a more direct proof of this result.\nBy the result of [4], if tR(p, t) is not bounded, then tR(p, t) \u2192 \u221e as\nt \u2192 \u221e. We consider this case in the next theorem.\nTheorem 2.3. Suppose that at some p \u2208 M, limt\u2192\u221e tR(p, t) = \u221e and\ninf t R(p, t) = 0.

To prove (i), since inf t R(p, t) = 0 and Ric > 0 for all t, we can\nfind Ti \u2192 \u221e such that ai = R(p, 3Ti ) = inf t\u2208[0,3Ti ] R(p, t). Then ai > 0\nand limi\u2192\u221e ai = 0. Now the metrics gi (t) = ai g(Ti + ati ) solve (2.1) for\n\u2212ai Ti \u2264 t < \u221e.

By the assumption that tR(p, t) \u2192 \u221e\nthat | \u2202t\nas t \u2192 \u221e, we conclude that limi\u2192\u221e ai Ti = \u221e and\n\u2202 (i)\nR (p, si ) = 0.\ni\u2192\u221e \u2202t\nWe now consider the sequence of metrics hi (t) = gi (si + t) which\nsolve (2.1) for \u2212ai Ti \u2212 si \u2264 t < \u221e. By Lemma 2.1 and the definition\nof ai , there is a constand C2 independent of i such that\n(2.18)\n\n(2.19)\n\nlim\n\nb(i) (x, t) \u2264 C2\nR\n\n\u221a\nb(i) (x, t) is the\nb (i) (p, ai Ti ) and 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 ai Ti , where R\nfor all x \u2208 B\n0\n2\nbt(i) is the geodesic ball with respect to\nscalar curvature of hi (t) and B\nh(i) .\nSince the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature of g(t) at p are uniformly\npinched, the Ricci curvature of hi (p, 0) is uniformly bounded from below. Noting that ai Ti \u2192 \u221e as i \u2192 \u221e, by (2.18) and (2.19), we can\nproceed as in the proof of Theorem 2.1(i) to show that the injectivity\nradius of hi (0) is uniformly bounded from below. Rescaling back to\ng(t), using the definition of ai we see that (i) is true.\nPart (ii) follows from part (i) as in the proof of Theorem 2.1.\nBy the above facts, in particular that (2.18) holds on a sequence\nof balls with radii going to \u221e, one can proceed as in the proof of\nTheorem 2.2 (iii) to conclude that (M, hi (0), p) converges a complete\nsteady gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with positive Ricci curvature and\nnonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature. Note that the gradient\nof the function defining the gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton has a unique\nzero by (2.18) and the fact that the Ricci curvature is positive. Hence\nthe gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton is biholomorphic to Cn by the results\nin [10, 2].\n\u0003\nThe methods of proof in the theorems above allow us to study the\nholomorphic isometries of (M, g(0)).\nTheorem 2.4. Let (M, g(t)) be as in the Basic Assumption 1. Suppose in addition that tR(p, t) \u2192 \u221e and the eigenvalues of the Rc(p, t)\nare uniformly pinched. Let \u0393 be a finite subset of the holomorphic isometry group of (M, g(0)). Then there exists q \u2208 M such that q is fixed\nby any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393.\n\n\f14\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nProof. By Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, we can find ti \u2192 \u221e and a bounded\nsequence ai > 0 such that (M, ai g(ti ), p) converge to a steady gradient\nK\u00e4hler-Ricci soltion with positive Ricci curvature. By the proof of\nTheorem 2.1, we conclude that there exists a > 0 such that \u2207i R(i) has\na unique zero at qi \u2208 Bi (p, a) which lies inside Bi (p, a3 ). Here Bi is\nthe geodesic ball, \u2207i is the covariant derivative and R(i) is the scalar\ncurvature with respect to ai g(ti ).\nWe claim that for any holomorphic isometry of (M, g(0)), there is i0\nsuch that \u03b3(qi ) = qi for all i \u2265 i0 . It is easy to see that the theorem\nfollows from this claim as \u0393 is finite.\nBy the uniqueness of K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow [18] (see also [21]), \u03b3 is also\nan isometry of g(t) and hence of ai g(ti ) for all i. So \u03b3(qi ) is also a zero\nof \u2207i R(i) . Since qi is the unique zero of \u2207i R(i) in Bi (p, a) it is easy to\nsee that the claim is true if \u03b3 fixes p.\nSuppose \u03b3(p) 6= p. Since for any \u01eb > 0, Bti (p, \u01eb) exhaust M, see [13],\nand since ai is uniformly bounded, we conclude that there exists i0 such\nthat if i \u2265 i0 , then \u03b3(p) \u2208 Bi (p, a3 ). Hence \u03b3(qi ) \u2208 Bi (p, a). Since qi is\nthe unique zero of \u2207i R(i) in Bi (p, a), we have \u03b3(qi ) = qi for i \u2265 i0 . \u0003\nIn case tR(p, t) is uniformly bounded in t or if g(t) is an eternal\nsolution, then we have the following much stronger result.\nTheorem 2.5. Let (M, g(t)) be as in the Basic Assumption 1. Suppose in addition that either (i) for some p \u2208 M, tR(p, t) is uniformly\nbounded in t, or (ii) g(t) is an eternal solution. Then there exists\nq \u2208 M such that q is fixed by any holomorphic isometry of (M, g(0)).\nProof. First consider the case that g(t) is an eternal solution. Then\nby the monotonicity of the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature in t [13]\n(Theorem 6.1), the Ricci curvature at p is uniformly bounded below\naway from zero for all t. On the other hand, by the LYH type differential inequality by Cao [6], we know that dtd R(p, t) \u2265 0. Hence\nas in [12], for any ti \u2192 \u221e, (M, g(ti ), p) will subconverge to a gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with positive Ricci curvature and nonnegative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature. Hence as in the proof of Theorem\n2.4, we can prove that there exist T > 0 and some a > 0 such that for\nt \u2265 T there exists q(t) \u2208 Bt (p, a) which is the unique point satisfying\n\u2207t R(q(t), t) = 0 in Bt (p, 3a).\nAlso as in the proof of Theorem 2.4, we can prove that for every\nholomorphic isometry \u03b3, there exists T\u03b3 such that \u03b3(q(t)) = q(t) for all\nt \u2265 T\u03b3 .\nWe want to prove that every isometry \u03b3 fixes q(T ). Suppose \u03b3(q(T )) 6=\nq(T ). Since dT (p, q(T )) < a by uniqueness of q(T ), we must have\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n15\n\ndT (\u03b3(q(T )), q(T )) \u2265 2a. On the other hand, we have\ndT\u03b3 (\u03b3(q(T\u03b3 )), q(T\u03b3 )) = 0\nand T < T\u03b3 by the choice of T\u03b3 . Now by uniqueness of q(t) and the\nfact that g(t) is a solution of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow equation, it is not\nhard to see that q(t) describes a continuous path on M with respect to\nt, and thus the same is true for \u03b3(q(t)). It follows then, that for some\nT < T0 < T\u03b3 we must have dT0 (\u03b3(q(T0 )), q(T0 )) = a. But this would\nviolate the fact that q(T0 ) is the unique zero of \u2207T0 R in BT0 (p, 3a).\nThis proves the case when g(t) is an eternal solution.\nThe case that t(R(p, t) is uniformly bounded in t can be proved\nsimilarly using Theorem 2.2.\n\u0003\nBy the results of Shi [28] (see also [12]), if (M, g) has bounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature with average quadratic curvature decay and positive Ricci somewhere on M, then there exists a\nlong time solution to K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow such that tR(p, t) is uniformly\nbounded independently of p. We thus have the following immediate\nCorollary of Theorem 2.2 and 2.5:\nCorollary 2.1. Let (M, g) be a complete non-compact K\u00e4hler manifold\nwith non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature. Suppose k(x, r) \u2264\nC/(1 + r 2 ) for some C and all r and x, and that Rc(p) > 0 for some\np \u2208 M. Then M is biholomorphic to Cn , and there exists q \u2208 M such\nthat q is fixed by any holomorphic isometry of (M, g).\n3. Fiber bundle structures\nIn this section we study structure of complete noncompact K\u00e4hler\nmanifold with nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature using the\nK\u00e4hler-Ricci flow. To motivate our discussion, let us consider an example. Take a complete noncompact K\u00e4hler metric h on Cn with positive holomorphic bisectional curvature which is U(n) invariant, see\n[5, 6, 31]. Let M\u0303 = Cl \u00d7 Cn (l \u2265 1 with metric ge = ge \u00d7 h where ge\nis the standard metric on Cl . Let k be a nonzero \u221areal number. Define\n\u03b3 : M\u0303 \u2192 M\u0303 as \u03b3(\u03b6, z) = (\u03b61 + k, \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6l , e2\u03c0k \u22121 z) where \u03b6 \u2208 Cl\nand z \u2208 Cn . Then \u03b3 is a holomorphic isometry of (M\u0303, e\ng ) and \u03b3 m has\nno fixed point unless m = 0. Let \u0393 be the cyclic group generated\nby \u03b3. Then (M, g) = (M\u0303, e\ng )/\u0393 is a complete noncompact manifold\nwith nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature, which is a vector\nbundle over Cl /\u0393\u2032 where \u0393\u2032 is the group generated by \u03b3 \u2032 which sends\n(\u03b61 , \u03b62, . . . , \u03b6l ) to (\u03b61 + k, \u03b62 , . . . , \u03b6l ).\n\n\f16\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nNow let (M, g(t)) be long time solution of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (2.1)\non complete noncompact K\u00e4hler manifold with bounded nonnegative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature yet without any assumption on the\npositivity of Ricci curvature. If (M\u0303 , g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (t)) is the universal cover of\nM with corresponding lift g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (t), then g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (t) is also such a solution\nto K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow . As mentioned in the introduction, (M\u0303 , g\u0303i\uf6be\u0304 (t))\nsplits for each t > 0 as (Ck \u00d7 N, ge \u00d7 h(t)) where ge is the standard\nEuclidean metric on Cn and h(t) solves (1.2) and has positive Ricci\ncurvature for t > 0. We will use our results from \u00a72, for the factor\n(N, h(t)), together with the arguments in [25, \u00a75] to provide a fiber\nbundle description of M. In Corollary 3.1 we treat the particular case of\nan initial complete non-compact K\u00e4hler manifold having bounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature which decays quadratically\nin the average sense.\nWe begin with the following\nBasic assumption 2: Let M n be a noncompact complex manifold\nand let (M n , g(t)) be a complete solution of the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow\n(3.1)\n\n\u2202gi\uf6be\u0304\n= \u2212Ri\uf6be\u0304\n\u2202t\n\non M \u00d7 [0, \u221e) with uniformly bounded nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature in spacetime, so that one of the following is true:\nCase 1: For some p \u2208 M (and hence for all point), tR(p, t) is uniformly\nbounded in t.\nCase 2: For some point p \u2208 M, limt\u2192\u221e tR(p, t) = \u221e and the positive\neigenvalues of Ric(t) at p are uniformly pinched for all t.\nTheorem 3.1. With the Basic Assumption 2, there is k \u2265 0 such\nthat for all t, (M, g(t)) is a holomorphic Riemannian fiber bundle over\nCk /\u0393 where \u0393 is a discrete subgroup of holomorphic isometries of Ck ,\nwith fiber being Cn\u2212k in Case 1 and a pseudoconvex domain in Cn\u2212k in\nCase 2. If in Case 2, g(t) is in fact an eternal solution, then the fiber\nis also Cn\u2212k .\nProof. Let M\u0303 be the universal cover of M. By the splitting result of\nCao [7] we have M\u0303 = Ck \u00d7 \u00d1 and e\ng (t) = g\u01eb (t) \u00d7 h\u0303(t) where g\u01eb (t) is flat\nand h\u0303(t) satisfies the Basic Assumption 1 of \u00a71 on \u00d1 . In particular,\nin Case 1 \u00d1 is biholomorphic to Cn\u2212k by Theorem 2.2, and in Case\n2 \u00d1 is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space and biholomorphic to a\npseudoconvex domain in Cn\u2212k by Theorem 2.1 and 2.3. Moreover, if in\nCase 2, g(t) and hence h\u0303(t) is in fact an eternal solution, then by [12]\n\u00d1 is biholomorphic to Cn .\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n17\n\nLet F \u2208 \u0393, the first fundamental group of M with respect to the\nmetric g(0). By the uniqueness of K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow (see [18, 21]), F is\nan holomorphic isometry with respect to g(t) for all t. As a mapping\non M\u0303 , F (x\u0303, \u1ef9) = (f1 (x\u0303, \u1ef9), f2 (x\u0303, \u1ef9)) where f1 : M\u0303 \u2192 Ck , f2 : M\u0303 \u2192 \u00d1,\nx\u0303 \u2208 Ck and \u1ef9 \u2208 \u00d1.\nThe following argument is basically as in [25, \u00a75], using the fact that\n\u00d1 is biholomorphic either to Cn\u2212k or a pseudoconvex domain in Cn\u2212k\nwhich is homeomorphic to R2(n\u2212k) .\nWe first prove f2 is independent of x\u0303. Suppose there is x\u03031 6= x\u03032\nand \u1ef9 such that f2 (x\u03031 , \u1ef9) 6= f2 (x\u03032 , \u1ef9). Let \u03b1 be a line passing through\nx\u03031 and x\u03032 in Ck . Then \u03b1(s) = (\u03b3(s), \u1ef9) is a line in M\u0303 . That is to\nsay, \u03b1 is a geodesic which is minimizing between any two points in \u03b1.\nHence F \u25e6\u03b1(s) is a line of M\u0303 too. So its projection onto \u00d1 is minimizing\nbetween any two end points as a curve in \u00d1 . But the projection is f2 \u25e6\u03b1,\nwhich is not a constant curve because f2 (x\u03031 , \u1ef9) 6= f2 (x\u03032 , \u1ef9). Hence it\nmust be a line in \u00d1 . But this implies a factor C is splitted from \u00d1 by\n[15]. This is impossible because \u00d1 has positive Ricci curvature. Thus\nthe claim is established.\nNext we want to prove that f1 is independent of \u1ef9. First note that\n\u22121\nF\n= (h1 , h2 ) with h2 independent of x\u0303. Hence f2 \u25e6 h2 is identity\nand h2 = f2\u22121 . On the other hand, since F is an isometry, f2 cannot\nincrease length. For if \u03b3(s) is a curve in \u00d1, then the length for the curve\n\u03b1(s) = (x\u0303, \u03b3(s)) and the length of F \u25e6 \u03b1(s) = (f1 (x\u0303, \u03b3(s)), f2(\u03b3(s)) are\nequal. But the length of \u03b1 is the same as the length of \u03b3. So the length\nf2 (\u03b3(s)) cannot be larger than the length of \u03b3. But this is also true for\nf2\u22121 . Hence f2 is an isometry. If this is the case, then f1 (x\u0303, \u03b3(s)) must\nbe a point. Hence f1 is independent to \u1ef9.\nLet \u039b1 = {f1 |(f1 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393 for some f2 }. Then \u039b1 is a subgroup of the\nholomorphic isometries of (Ck , g\u01eb (t)) for all t. We claim that \u039b1 is fixed\npoint free. Suppose there is F \u2032 = (f1\u2032 , f2\u2032 ) \u2208 \u0393 such that f1\u2032 (x\u03030 ) = x\u03030 for\nsome x\u03030 . Let\nG = {f2 \u2208 | F = (f1 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393 for some f1 with f1 (x\u03030 ) = x\u03030 }.\nThen G is a subgroup of the group of the holomorphic isometries of\n\u00d1. G acts on \u00d1 freely because \u0393 acts on M\u0303 freely. Now h\u0303 descends to\n\u00d1/G while still satisfying the Basic Assumption 1 in \u00a71, and thus\nmust be simply connected by Theorems 2.1,2.2 and 2.3 which leads to\na contradiction if G is not trivial. Thus f1\u2032 must be trivial and \u039b1 is\nfixed point free.\n\n\f18\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nLet \u03b2 be the homomorphism from \u0393 to \u039b1 defined by \u03b2(F ) = f1 ,\nfor F = (f1 , f2 ). Suppose F = (f1\u2032 , f2\u2032 ) \u2208 \u0393 and f1\u2032 is the identity map.\nThen by similar argument, we can prove that the group:\n{f2 | (f1\u2032 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393}\nis trivial. Hence \u03b2 is an isomorphism. Then \u039b1 acts on M\u0303 isometrically\nholomorphically and freely by f (x\u0303, \u1ef9) = (f (x\u0303), \u03c12 \u25e6 \u03b2 \u22121 (f )(\u1ef9)) where \u03c12\nis the homomorphism given by mapping F = (f1 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393 to f2 .\nHence as shown in [25, \u00a75], M is a Riemannian and holomorphic\nfiber bundle over Ck /\u039b1 with fiber \u00d1 . By the comments in the first\nparagraph of the proof, we see that this completes the proof of the\nTheorem.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.2. If n \u2212 k = 1 in the previous Theorem, then (M, g(t))\nis a holomorphic Riemannian line bundle over Ck /\u0393\nProof. Let \u0393 and \u00d1 as in the proof of previous theorem. Then \u00d1 is\nbihlomorphic to C and has a global holomorphic coordinate z. Thus\nfor any F \u2208 \u0393 with F = (f1 , f2 ), f2 (z) = az + b for some a 6= 0 and\nb \u2208 C. Now by Theorem 2.4, any f2 has a fixed point. It follows that\nany nontrivial f2 with F = (f1 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393, has a unique fixed point. By\nTheorem 2.4 again, we conclude that there is z0 \u2208 \u00d1 = C such that\nf2 (z0 ) = z0 for any holomorphic isometry f2 with F = (f1 , f2 ) \u2208 \u0393.\nWe see that we can choose a global holomorphic coordinate z\u0303 on \u00d1 =\nC such that in this coordinate, every such f2 has the form f2 (z\u0303) =\naz\u0303 for some complex constant a. Thus in this case, the fiber bundle\nstructure constructed in the proof of Theorem 3.1 is in fact a line bundle\nstructure. This completes the proof of the Theorem.\n\u0003\nBy the remarks preceding Corollary 2.1, we may have the following\nimmediate corollary to Theorems 3.1 and 3.2:\nCorollary 3.1. Let (M, g) be a complete non-compact K\u00e4hler manifold\nwith non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature. Suppose k(x, r) \u2264\nC/(1 + r 2 ) for some C and all r and x. Then there is k \u2265 0 such that\n(M, g) is a holomorphic Riemannian fiber bundle over Ck /\u0393 where \u0393\nis a discrete subgroup of holomorphic isometries of Ck , with fiber being\nCn\u2212k .\nMoreover, if n \u2212 k = 1 then the above fiber bundle is in fact a line\nbundle.\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n19\n\n4. Gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci Solitons\nIn this section we refine the results in the previous section in the case\nof a steady gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with bounded and nonnegative\nholomorphic bisectional curvature. We remark that in the case of an\nexpanding gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton satisfying the same curvature\nconditions, we have M biholomorphic to Cn by [10], see also [2].\nFirst let us fix some notations. Let (M n , g) be a complete steady gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci Ricci soliton with bounded and nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature. Namely, there is a real valued function\nf such that\n(4.1)\n\nfi\uf6be\u0304 = Ri\uf6be\u0304\nfij = 0.\n\nLet (M\u0303 , e\ng ) be the universal cover of (M n , g). By [7], M\u0303 = Ck \u00d7 \u00d1\nand e\ng = ge \u00d7 h\u0303, where ge is the standard metric and (\u00d1 , h\u0303) is a steady\ngradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with bounded nonnegative holomorphic\nbisectional curvature and with positive Ricci curvature. Hence there\nexists some smooth real valued function f satisfying (4.1) on \u00d1. Now\nlet us also assume that the scalar curvature of M attains its maximum\nat some point. Hence the same is true for \u00d1 . Then by [8] \u2207f (the\nreal gradient of f relative to h\u0303) has a unique zero at some p\u0303. Let\n\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbl > 0 be the eigenvalues of the Ricci curvature at p\u0303,\nwhere l = n \u2212 k. Recall that \u00d1 is biholomorpic to Cl by [10], [2]. Let\n\u0393 be the fundamental group of M. Then by the proof of Theorem 3.1,\neach F in \u0393 is of the form (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ) where \u03b31 is an holomorphic isometry\nof Ck and \u03b32 is a holomorphic isometry of (\u00d1, h\u0303). Let\n\u039b1 = {\u03b31| (\u03b31 , \u03b32) \u2208 \u0393 for some \u03b32 },\nand\n\u039b2 = {\u03b32| (\u03b31 , \u03b32) \u2208 \u0393 for some \u03b31 }.\n\nWe want to describe the holomorphic isometries in \u039b2 . In fact, we\nwant to describe any holomorphic isometry of \u00d1 in general. It was\nshown by Bryant [2] that there is a global holomorphic coordinates\nz i of \u00d1, ranging\nover Cl ,\u0001which linearize the holomorphic vector field\n\u221a\nZ = 21 \u2207f \u2212 \u22121J(\u2207f ) . That is to say,\nZ=\n\nl\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202z i\n\nSuch coordinates are called Poincar\u00e8 coordinates.\n\n\f20\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nRemark 4.1. We remark that in case of expanding gradient K\u00e4hlerRicci soliton with nonnegative Ricci curvature, Poincar\u00e9 coordinates\nalso exist. This is because in this case, the potential function f has a\nunique critical point and J(\u2207f ) is also a Killing vector field.\nNow let \u03c6 : (\u00d1 , h\u0303) \u2192 (\u00d1 , h\u0303) be a holomorphic isometry. Thus\n\u03c6 (h\u0303) = h\u0303.\n\u2217\n\nLemma 4.1. The following are true:\n(1) \u03c6\u2217 (f ) = f .\n(2) \u03c6\u2217 (Z) = Z.\nProof. Let f1 = \u03c6\u2217 (f ). Since \u03c6\u2217 (h\u0303) = h\u0303 we have \u22072 (f1 ) = \u03c6\u2217 (\u22072 f )\nand thus (f1 )i\uf6be\u0304 = Ri\uf6be\u0304 = fi\uf6be\u0304 . Hence \u2207f1 has a unique zero, which must\nbe at p\u0303. Hence \u03c6(p\u0303) = p\u0303. So f1 (p\u0303) = f (p\u0303). On the other hand, since\n\u2207f (p\u0303) = \u2207f1 (p\u0303) = 0 and \u22072 (f \u2212 f1 ) = 0, we conclude that (1) is true.\n(2) follows from the definition of Z, the fact that \u03c6\u2217 (h\u0303) = h\u0303 and from\n(1).\n\u0003\nLemma 4.2. Let \u03c6 be a holomorphic isometry of (\u00d1, h\u0303). Let \u03c6(z) = w\nin the Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. Then \u03c6 is an upper triangular polynomial\nmap in the sense that\nw = A(z) + G(z).\nwhere A(z) is a linear map and G = (G1 , . . . , Gl ) with Gi = Gi (z i+1 , . . . , z l ).\nIf in addition, for all j\nl\nX\nmi \u03bbi 6= \u03bbj\ni=1\n\nfor all nonnegative integers mi such that\nlinear map.\n\nPl\n\ni=1\n\nmi \u2265 2, then \u03c6 is a\n\nProof. This is basically a result in [2]. For the sake of completeness,\nwe sketch the proof here. Since \u03c6\u2217 (Z) = Z and we are using Poincar\u00e9\ncoordinates in the domain and target, for each i, we have\n(4.2)\n\ni\n\n\u03bbi w =\n\nl\nX\n\n\u03bbj z j\n\nj=1\n\ndw i\ndz j\n\neverywhere. On the other hand for each i, as a function of z we know\nthat w i has a global power series representation\n(4.3)\n\ni\n\nw =\n\n|\u03b1|=\u221e\n\nX\n\n|\u03b1|=1\n\nc\u03b1 (i)z \u03b1\n\n\fOn the simply connectedness of K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\n21\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a multi-index. The fact that there is no constant term in\n(4.3) follows from the the fact that by their definition, both z and w\nmust vanish at p\u0303 \u2208 \u00d1 . Now by substituting the power series in (4.3)\nand its derivative with respect to z for both sides of (4.2), equating\ncoefficients and using the fact that the \u03bbi 's are all positive, the result\nfollows.\n\u0003\nIn [32], Yang proves the following: Let M be a noncompact K\u00e4hlerRicci soliton with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Suppose its scalar curvature attains a positive maximum at a compact complex submanifold\nK with codimension 1 and the Ricci curvature is positive away from\nK. Then M is a holomorphic line bundle over K.\nIn case the holomorphic bisectional curvature is bounded and nonnegative, from the lemma, the proof of Theorem 3.1 and the discussion\nbefore Lemma 4.1, we have the following:\nTheorem 4.1. Let (M, g) be a steady gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton\nwith bounded non-negative holomorphic bisectional curvature such that\nthe scalar curvature is maximal at some p \u2208 M. Then assuming the\nabove notation, there exists global complex coordinates on \u00d1 such that\nM is a Riemannian and holomorphic fiber bundle over Ck /\u039b1 with fiber\nC n\u2212k such that each \u03b32 \u2208 \u039b2 is of upper triangular form.

The motivation is from the work of\nNi [24] where he proved that a complete noncompact K\u1e27aler manifold\nwith bounded and nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature and\nwith maximum volume growth must have quadratic curvature decay as\nin (1) in the Introduction.\nProposition 4.1. Suppose (M n , g) is a complete Riemannian manifold\nsuch that g is an expanding gradient Ricci soliton with nonnegative\nscalar curvature. Then for any o \u2208 M, there is a constant C > 0 such\nthat Vo (r) \u2265 Cr n for all r \u2265 1, where Vo (r) is the volume of geodesic\nball of radius r with center at o.\n\n\f22\n\nAlbert Chau and Luen-Fai Tam\n\nProof. Let f be such that fij = Rij + gij . By the proof in [23, \u00a720]\n(see also [19]), R + |\u2207f |2 \u2212 2f is a constant, where R is the scalar\ncurature. Modifying f by adding a constant to f , we may assume that\nR + |\u2207f |2 \u2212 2f = 0. Since R \u2265 0, we have f \u2265 0 and |\u2207f |2 \u2264 2f.\nFix o \u2208 M. For any x let \u03b3(s) be a minimal geodesic from o to x\nparametrized by arc length and let r = d(o, x). Then for any 0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 r\nd\nf (\u03b3(\u03c4 )) \u2264 |\u2207f |\nd\u03c4\n1\n\u2264 (2f ) 2 .\n\n(4.4)\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nHence f 2 (x) \u2264 \u221a12 r + f 2 (o). This implies that |\u2207f |(x) \u2264 r + (2f (o)) 2 .\nOn the other hand, \u2206f \u2265 n, where n is the dimension of M.
