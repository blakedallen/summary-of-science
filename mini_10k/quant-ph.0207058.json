This is an algebro-topological object (nontrivial only for mixed states) which captures the localisation of entanglement of the state. Particular examples of separability polytopes for\n3-partite systems are explicitly provided. It turns out that this characterisation of entanglement is associated with simulation of arbitrary\nunitary operations by 1- and 2-qubit gates. A topological description\nof how entanglement changes in course of such simulation is provided.\n\nIntroduction\nEntanglement in multipartite quantum system is now treated as a key resource in quantum information processing. That is why multiple efforts are\ndrawn to quantification of entanglement for quantum states.\nFor bipartite quantum systems all entanglement measures are essentially\nof numerical nature as a single real positive number is enough to quantify\nthe degree of entanglement. In the case of multipartite systems the situation\ndiffers drastically. It was observed that even pure states of a 3-particle system\ncan be entangled in different ways, which can not be interconverted by local\nunitary transformations.\n1\n\n\fIn this paper, starting from the classification of mixed bipartite states\n[8] I introduce a non-numerical, topological characterisation of mixed Npartite quantum states. It is known that, in contrast with the classical\ncase, a quantum state can be represented by different inequivalent ensembles\nof pure states. I consider equivalence classes of ensembles with respect to\ntheir localisation. With each state a polytope (a geometrical object in an\naffine space) is associated such that every maximal simplex of the polytope\nrepresents a class of equivalently localised ensembles.\nTo make the paper complete, all the necessary definitions are provided.\n\n1\n\nComposite systems and partitions\n\nLet S be a N-partite physical system. We may dwell on a less detailed\ndescription of multipartite nature of S, namely, grouping subsystems in their\nmost detailed setting and considering these groups as subsystems. Each\nsuch passage to a less detailed description of the composite structure of S we\nassociate with appropriate partition of the total set A of subsystems of S.\nDenote the collection of all partitions of A by \u03a0(A) or \u03a0(N) where N\nis the number of the subsystems. The first observation is that partitions\nare ordered. A partition \u03a3 is called finer than a partition \u03a3\u2032 (and \u03a3\u2032 is,\nrespectively, coarser than \u03a3 whenever any element of \u03a3\u2032 is a union of\nelements of the partition \u03a3. Denote it\n\u03a3\u2032 \u0016 \u03a3\n\n(1)\n\nThe order relation \u0016 on partitions is partial, that is, two partitions may\nbe incomparable. To elucidate it, consider an example.\nExample. Let S be a 4-partite system, enumerate its components by numbers A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Consider the following partitions \u03a3 = {12, 3, 4}, \u03a3\u2032 =\n{12, 34}, \u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {13, 24}, see figure 1.\nFor instance, we treat (S, \u03a3) as a tripartite system for which 1 and 2 together are treated as one subsystem while (S, \u03a3\u2032 ) is bipartite. Among these\npartitions \u03a3\u2032 \u0016 \u03a3, while \u03a3\u2032\u2032 is not comparable with any of \u03a3, \u03a3\u2032 .\nTo summarise, we observe that besides the initial, finest decomposition\nof the state space H of the composite system S we may consider coarser\n2\n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n; \u03a3\u2032 =\n\n\u03a3 =\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n; \u03a3\u2032\u2032 =\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 1: An example of different partitions of a 4-partite system.\ndecompositions each of which associated with certain partition of the set A\nof subsystems of S. Let us denote it as follows. The initial decomposition of\nH is\nH = \u2297i\u2208A Hi\nand each partition \u03a3 = {\u03c31 , . . . \u03c3M } (where \u03c31 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03c3M = A) gives rise to\nthe following decomposition of the overall state space H as:\nH = H\u03c31 \u2297 * * * \u2297 H\u03c3M\n\n1.1\n\n(2)\n\nProduct, separable and entangled states.\n\nGiven a state of a composite N-partite system S, denote its density matrix\nby \u03c1. A density matrix \u03c1 is called product if it can be represented as a\ntensor product of density matrices of subsystems\n\u03c1 = \u03c11 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1N\n\n(3)\n\nA state \u03c1 is separable if its density matrix is a convex combination of\nproduct ones.\nX\n\u03c1=\np\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b11 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1\u03b1N\n(4)\nP\nwith p\u03b1 \u2265 0 and\np\u03b1 = 1.\nThe states which are not separable are called entangled.\n\n3\n\n\f1.2\n\nThe relativity of multipartite entanglement\n\nNow let us weaken the condition for states of a composite system S to be\nproduct and separable. Namely, instead of requiring (3) for the tensor product\nH = H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 HN\nwe make this condition relative with respect to a partition \u03a3 of the set A of\nsubsystems of S, that is, with respect to the decomposition (2).\nGiven a partition \u03a3 = {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3M } of A and a a density matrix \u03c1 in the\nstate space of S, \u03c1 is called \u03a3-product whenever it can be represented as a\ntensor product\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c31 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1\u03c3M\nand \u03a3-separable if it is a convex combination of \u03a3-product states:\nX\n\u03c1=\np\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b1\u03c31 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1\u03b1\u03c3N\n\n(5)\n\nIn other words, (5) means that we can prepare \u03c1 as an ensemble of mixed\nstates located at sites \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3M .\nGiven a state \u03c1, we may now ask for each partition \u03a3 of the set A of\nsubsystems of S if \u03c1 is \u03a3-separable or not. As a result we obtain the set \u03a0(\u03c1)\nof partitions of A with respect to which \u03c1 is separable (5):\n\u03a3 \u2208 \u03a0(\u03c1)\n\n\u21d4\n\n\u03c1 is \u03a3-separable\n\nFor a given state \u03c1 the set \u03a0(\u03c1) has the following property [8]:\n\u001a\n\u03a3 \u2208 \u03a0(\u03c1)\n\u21d4 \u03a3\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0(\u03c1)\n\u2200\u03c1\n\u03a3\u2032 \u0016 \u03a3\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nCorollary. To specify \u03a0(\u03c1) we need to provide only maximal (with respect\nto the order (1), that is, finest) partitions \u03a3 such that \u03c1 is \u03a3-separable. This\nprovides us a natural geometrical picture which will be coined partition polytopes. For the sake of self-consistency, I first recall the necessary definitions.\n\n4\n\n\f1.3\n\nSimplices and polytopes\n\nSuppose we have a real affine space A of sufficiently high dimension, and\nthere are M + 1 independent points there. The convex hull of these points\nis called simplex of dimension M. For example:\nA cut\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\nis a 1-simplex.\n\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2709 \u2745\u2709\n\nA triangle\n\nis a 2-simplex.\n\n\u2709\n\u2701\n\u2701 \u2709\u2746\u2746\n\u2745\u2746\u2709\n\u2701\n\u2709 \u2745\n\nA tetrahedron\n\nis a 3-simplex.\n\nand so on. The points we have connected are called vertices of the simplex.\nThe convex hulls of K + 1 vertices in a simplex are called its faces. In\nparticular, 0-faces are vertices, 1-faces are called edges.\nA polytope is a collection {Si } of simplices in the space A having the\nfollowing property:\n\u0014\n\u2032\na face of both Si , Si\n\u2032\ni\ni\u2032\n\u2200 i, i\nS \u2229S =\n(8)\n\u2205\nThe vertices of a polytope is the set of all vertices of all its simplices,\ndenote it by V\nV = \u222ai V (Si )\nFor instance\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n,\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n,\n\n\u2709\n\nwhile\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\n,\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2709 \u2745\u2709\n\nare polytopes\n\nare not (provided dim A = 2)\n\nLet S, S\u2032 be two simplices in affine spaces A, A\u2032. An affine mapping\n\u03c6 : A \u2192 A\u2032 is called simplicial whenever the following conditions hold:\n5\n\n\f\u2022 Any vertex v of S is mapped onto a vertex of S\u2032 . This mapping is not\nnecessarily injective, different vertices may be mapped to one.\n\u2022 'Simplicial mappings do not brake skeletons': if {v1 , . . . , vK } is a face\nof S then its image is a face as well (of perhaps smaller dimensionality).\nBoth these conditions can be symbolically written down as:\n\u03c6(S) \u2286 S\u2032\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\nTopological expression of physical properties\n\nNow we have in our disposal all the necessary mathematics to express certain\nphysical properties of a state \u03c1 in a topological fashion. First I introduce the\nappropriate objects associated with states, namely, the separability polytopes\nand then provide some examples, both trivial and non-trivial.\n\n2.1\n\nSeparability polytopes\n\nLet us see how the introduced geometrical objects can represent relations\nbetween different partitions. With any partition \u03a3\u03b1 of the set A we associate\na simplex whose vertices are in 1\u20131 correspondence with the elements of the\npartition \u03a3 (= disjoint subsets of A).\nS\u03b1 = S(\u03a3\u03b1 )\nThe separability polytope of a state \u03c1 of S is built as follows:\n(i) Take all maximal partitions {\u03a31 , . . . , \u03a3K } with respect to which \u03c1 is\nseparable.\n(ii) Consider the set V whose elements are all elements of the partitions\n{\u03a31 , . . . , \u03a3K } (that is, subsets of A). Formally it is just:\nV = {\u03a31 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03a3K }\nand denote by D the cardinality of the set V .\n6\n\n\f(iii) Take an affine space A of sufficiently high dimension and place there\nD independent points corresponding to the elements of V . They will\nbe the vertices of the future separability polytope.\n(iv) For each partition \u03a3i form the convex hull of appropriate vertices.\nThe result we call the separability polytope of the state \u03c1, denote it\nK(\u03c1):\nK = \u222a{S(\u03a3i ) | \u03a3i \u2208 \u03a0(\u03c1)}\n\n(10)\n\nYet separability polytopes remain an abstract geometrical object for which\nphysical interpretation is to be provided. A quantum state in general does\nnot contain complete information about an ensemble which represents this\nstate (again, this is not the case for classical systems where the correspondence state\u2013ensemble is unique). What tells us the fact that a state \u03c1 is\nseparable with respect to a partition \u03a3 = {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3M }? This means that \u03c1\ncan be represented as a mixture of pure states of the form:\nX\n\u03c1=\np\u03b1| \u03a8\u03b1\u03c31 ih \u03a8\u03b1\u03c31 | \u2297 * * * \u2297 | \u03a8\u03b1\u03c3M ih \u03a8\u03b1\u03c3M |\nIf the partition \u03a3 is maximal, that means that each | \u03a8\u03b1\u03c3i i is entangled. So,\nthe simplex associated with a maximal partition shows us the 'localisation\nof entanglement' for ensembles representing the state \u03c1. If there are several\nmaximal partitions, each of these partitions is associated with a class of\nensembles which can represent \u03c1. Overlapping simplices indicate how similar\nare particular localizations of entanglement for different locally inequivalent\nensembles representing the same state \u03c1. Now consider some special cases,\nbeginning with trivial ones where separability polytopes degenerate.\n\n2.2\n\nTrivial cases\n\nBegin with pure states. If \u03c1 is a pure state, then its separability polytope\nK(\u03c1) is a simplex. Indeed, if \u03c1 is pure, then it is a projector on a pure state\n| \u03a8ii \u2208 H. Let \u03a3 = {\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3M } is such a partition of A that | \u03a8ii decomposes\ninto a product\n| \u03a8ii = | \u03a8\u03c31 i \u2297 * * * \u2297 | \u03a8\u03c3M i\n7\n\n(11)\n\n\fsuch that each | \u03a8\u03c3i i is entangled. Then suppose that there is another parti\u2032\ntion \u03a3\u2032 = {\u03c31\u2032 , . . . , \u03c3M\n} incomparable with \u03a3 in the sense (1). Then it turns\nout that | \u03a8ii has in addition to the decomposition (11) another one\n\u2032 i\n| \u03a8ii = | \u03a8\u03c31\u2032 i \u2297 * * * \u2297 | \u03a8\u03c3M\n\n(12)\n\nThen tracing out | \u03a8ii expressed as (11) with respect to a subsystem \u03c3i which\nis not in \u03a3\u2032 (it must exist as \u03a3, \u03a3\u2032 are incomparable) we get a pure state.\nOn the other hand, doing the same operation with | \u03a8ii expressed as (12) we\nget a mixed state. Therefore the conjectured \u03a3\u2032 does not exist, and we have\nthe only partition \u03a3 for the state \u03c1.\nThe separability simplex for a pure state is obtained as follows. We take\nthe simplex whose vertices are the subsystems of S and collapse the vertices\nwhich belong to the same element of the partition \u03a3. In particular, when\n\u03c1 is fully entangled, the polytope collapses to a single point. This shows\nthat the topological classification we provide is not complete with respect\nto LOCC (local operations + classical communications) applied to a single\ncopy of the system in question. It follows, for instance, from the existence of\nLOCC-inequivalent fully entangled tripartite mixed states [1, 7, 11].\nHowever, for the special case of pure states of multi-qubit systems a\nmore subtle classification exists based on the Carteret-Higuchi-Sudbery pure\nstates decomposition [6]. This classification starts from the same simplex of\nsubsystems but is more 'sparing' and does not collapse to the extent proposed\nhere. For further details the reader is referred to [10].\nThe next trivial case is that of bipartite systems. It is degenerate for the\nproposed construction as the variety of entanglement patterns is quite poor,\nthat is, a bipartite state can be either separable or entangled and there are\nno intermediate cases.\n\n2.3\n\nThree qubits.\n\nThree-qubit systems provide us first non-trivial examples of essentially different entanglement patterns for mixed states. Although the number of subsystem is still small to provide 'interesting' polytopes. Referring to the classification [8] of mixed 3-qubit states we have 5 different classes of states\ndisplayed in table 2.3\n\n8\n\n\fFully entangled states for which the separability polytope\nshrinks to a single point. An example of such state is, say\nGHZ state [9].\n\n\u2709\n\n1-qubit biseparable states which can be separated as \u03a3 =\n{A, BC} or \u03a3 = {B, AC} or \u03a3 = {C, AB}. For them the\nseparability polytopes are 1-simplices, that is, two points\nconnected by an edge (see section 1.3). An example of\nsuch state may be a product state of a pure 1-qubit state\nand fully entangled state of the remaining two qubits.\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\u2709\n\nAn interesting and slightly counterintuitive example [4]\nis that of 3-biseparable states which are separable with\nrespect to any bipartite split. For them the separability\npolytopes are disjoint unions of three 1-simplices.\n\n\u2709\n\u2745\n\u2709 \u2745\u2709\n\nFinally, separable states provide us one more trivial example - for them the separability polytopes are 2-simplices\n(that is, triangles).\n\n2-qubit\n\b biseparable states which can be separated as\n\u03a3 = {A, BC}, {B, AC} and similar ones where B, C\nare not separated out, respectively. The explicit examples\nof such states can be found in [8]. For them the separability polytopes are disjoint unions of two 1-simplices.\n\nTable 1: An exhaustive classification of entanglement patterns for the mixed\nstates of a 3-qubit system.\nRemark. In order to avoid confusion I emphasise that the lines drawn\nabove show that the appropriate parties are separable rather than entangled since usually, when entanglement pictures are drawn, the lines denote\nentangling interactions.\n\n2.4\n\nPhysical meaning of separability polytopes\n\nAny mixed state \u03c1 of an ensemble can be represented as a mixture of pure\nstates. For classical systems this representation is unique. In contrast, any\nmixed state of a quantum system can be represented as an ensemble of pure\n9\n\n\fstates in infinitely many inequivalent ways. When the system in question\nis composite, multipartite, for any given particular ensemble E representing\nthe state \u03c1 we may ask: 'is any of pure states forming E separable or not\nwith respect to this or that partition of the set of subsystems A of the system\nS' ? Or, in other words, we query if we can represent the density operator as\na mixture of appropriate product states. Separability polytopes are exactly\nthe objects which capture this property. They show how many inequivalent\n(from the point of view of localisation) ensembles can form a given state \u03c1.\n'Relatively local' transformations What can separability polytopes also\nserve for, is to broaden the group of unitary transformations with respect to\nwhich the entanglement picture of a multipartite state remains unchanged.\nWe can derive it using the fact that separability polytopes are not given ad\nhoc arbitrary ones. Their maximal simplices are associated with partitions.\nRecall that the collection of all possible partitions of a set A is partially\nordered by the relation (1). Moreover, the set of partitions has the structure\nof a lattice [5], that is, for any two partitions there exist their least upper\nbound and the greatest lower bound with respect to relation (1). This means,\nin turn, that we have a well defined operations of join \u2228 and meet \u2227 on\nsimplices:\nS1 \u2228 S2 = sup{S1 , S2 }\nS1 \u2227 S2 = inf{S1 , S2 }\nIn the sequel we shall be interested only in \u2228 operation. Let S = sup{Si } and\nconsider the class (a group, in fact) U\u03c1 of unitary transformation which are\nlocal with respect to the partition S which is the refinement of all maximal\nsimplices (=partitions) of the separability polytope K(\u03c1). Then any transformation from this group applied to \u03c1 keeps its separability polytope K(\u03c1)\nunchanged, however U\u03c1 is in general greater than the group of 'genuinely'\nlocal transformations.\n\n3\n\nImplementations of quantum gates from topological perspective\n\nIn this section I consider a register S of N, say, qubits (the number of individual degrees of freedom is not important) and stepwise implementation\n10\n\n\fof an arbitrary unitary transformation on it. By 'stepwise' I mean that at\neach time step only a 2-qubit transformation is carried out. Proceeding this\nway, one can implement, having a very limited scope of resources in disposal,\nan arbitrary unitary transformation on the whole system S up to any given\naccuracy [2].\nNow suppose we have a compound system S. In the sequel call it register,\nand call its subsystems qubits. Let us see what happens with the separability\npolytope of the state of the register in course of the stepwise execution of\nthis simulation. We start with a certain initial (in general, mixed) state \u03c10\nwith the separability polytope K(\u03c10 ). As it was claimed in section 2.4, K(\u03c10 )\nrepresents the equivalence classes of ensembles which can realise the state\n\u03c10 . At first step, when we pass from \u03c10 to \u03c11 = U0 \u03c10 U\u20200 we may view it\nas follows: pick an ensemble E of pure states associated with a particular\nmaximal simplex of K(\u03c10 ) and apply U0 to each pure state forming E.\nFor general U0 nothing certain can be said, but recall that we consider a\nspecial kind of transformations, namely, entangling at most two qubits. Let\nE be an ensemble representing \u03c1, associate with it a partition \u03a3 of S. The\naction of U0 may be either (i) entangling two qubits within one element of\nthe covering associated with the a partition or (ii) 'breaking the border', that\nis, entangling two qubits from different elements of the partition. Both these\noptions have direct topological interpretation.\nIn case (i) the appropriate partition remains intact, in case (ii) two elements of the partition merge. In terms of simplices option (ii) means that an\nedge of appropriate simplex collapses to a vertex. In both cases this transition\nis a simplicial mapping (see section 1.3). To see the real action of U0 we must\napply it to all non-equivalent ensembles (= maximal simplices of K(\u03c10 )). As\na result, the whole complex undergoes a simplicial contractin-some edges\nof K(\u03c10 ) may collapse to vertices.\nSince the vertices of K(\u03c10 ) are subsets of the set A of subsystems of S, it\nmay happen that the same subset will be obtained as different junctions. For\nexample, suppose we have the following edges (= pairs of disjoint subsets)\ne1 = {{1, 2}, {3}} ,\n\ne2 = {{1}, {2, 3}}\n\nand we see that they have no common vertices. When they both collapse,\nwe get\nU0 (e1 ) = {1, 2, 3} ,\n\nU0 (e2 ) = {1, 2, 3}\n11\n\n\fwhich means that in the resulting complex the two vertices U0 (e1 ), U0 (e2 )\nshould be identified. And again, this operation never 'breaks edges' that is\nwhy it is a simplicial mapping.\nSo, any two-qubit unitary transform on a composite system is associated\nwith a simplicial mapping of appropriate separability polytopes. But, as it\nwas mentioned above, any unitary transformation can be implemented as a\nsequence (in general infinite) of 2-qubit transformations.\nNow recall that we are dealing with finite-dimensional systems for which\nany set of states sharing the same entanglement pattern is of non-zero measure. That means that we can arrange the implementation in such a way\nthat after a finite number of steps the separability polytope of the state will\nnot change any longer. As a result, taking into account that compositions of\nsimplicial mappings are always simplicial, we can conclude that\nAny unitary transformation of any given state of a finite-dimensional\nmultipartite system can be associated with a simplicial mapping\nof their separability polytopes.\nRemark. Note that if we consider a unitary transformation per se, not\nimplemented as a sequence of at most 2-qubit operations, it has in general\nnothing to do with simplicial mappings. Therefore a particular simplicial\nmapping is associated with a realisation of the transformation rather than\nwith the transformation itself.\n\nConcluding remarks\nI have introduced an essentially non-numerical characterisation of mixed\nstates of multipartite quantum systems. With each state \u03c1 a polytope-\npurely topological object which can be realised as a polyhedron in a Euclidean\nspace - is associated. These polytopes capture the localisation properties of\npure states forming ensembles which can represent the state \u03c1. (by localisation of a pure state I mean with respect to which groups of subsystems it is\nentangled).\nIt turns out that the presented characterisation is related with the simulation of arbitrary unitary operations by 1- and 2-qubit gates. Namely, to\neach particular implementation of such kind a simplicial mapping-a well\nknown construction in algebraic topology-can be put into correspondence.\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgments.
