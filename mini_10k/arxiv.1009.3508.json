We report the first dynamic mass for an O-type supergiant, the interferometrically\nresolved SB2 system \u03b6 Ori A (O9.5Ib+B0/1). The separation of the system excludes any previous\nmass-transfer, ensuring that the derived masses can be compared to single star evolutionary\ntracks.\nKeywords. stars: binaries, stars: early-type, stars: fundamental parameters (masses)\n\n1. Introduction\nStellar masses in the upper HRD are notoriously hard to constrain. Very few masses\nare known independently from stellar evolution or wind models, mostly using eclipsing\nSB2 systems. For stars that have already evolved away from the main sequence, this is\na problematic technique, though: These are usually quite narrow short period systems,\nwhich means that the possibility of mass transfer via overflow having altered the evolutionary paths is high. Interferometry is in principle able to overcome this problem in\ncases where the orbit can be measured for an SB2.\nHummel et al. (2000) found the O9.5 Ib primary of \u03b6 Ori A to be a multiple star.\nIn addition to the well known B-component of spectral type B0 at V=3.77mag, several\narcseconds away, they found another companion (Ab) 40 mas away, about 2 mag fainter\nthan the primary (Aa), i.e. the magnitude of Ab is similar to that of component B.\n\n2. Observations\nAdditional Interferometric observations to complete the orbit coverage (Fig. 1, right).\nwere obtained at the NPOI in Flagstaff, Arizona. Spectroscopic observations were taken\nwith the echelle instruments HEROS and FEROS.\nIn the spectra all He i lines as well as He ii 4686 have a relatively narrow core with\nvarying RV in one sense, while the line wings are shifted in anti-phase wrt. the cores.\nThis is the signature of an SB2 binary. For some lines (almost) exclusive formation in the\nO9.5 component can be assumed. The best candidates are the He ii lines, typically not\nseen in B-type stars, except He ii 4686. The radial velocities of this line were measured\nwith Gaussian fits to the line center (Fig. 1, left). There are as well very weak and rather\nnarrow lines that are not expected in the O9 Ib star. These narrow lines are RV variable\nin the same sense as the cores of stronger lines, i.e. they belong to the companion and\nare indicative for an early type B star.\nIn addition to Gaussian fits, the RV curve was also measured by spectral disentangling\nwith VO-KOREL, a virtual observatory tool based on the KOREL code by Hadrava\n(1995).\n\u2020 Based on observations under ESO programs 076.C-0431, 080.A-9021, and 083.D-0589.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTh.

The 09.5 Ib star \u03b6 Ori Aa was found to have a mass of:\nM\u03b6 Ori Aa = 24.8 \u00b1 5.6 M\nWe as well give a mass for its early B-type companion Ab, which is 16.4 . This value is\nin reasonable agreement with the estimate of the companion to be a little evolved very\nearly B-type star. The mass of \u03b6 Ori Aa is also in good agreement with the theoretically\nexpected value for its spectral type, i.e. its track mass.\nWe stress that this is still a preliminary determination, based on only a few spectral\nlines and not yet using all available spectroscopic data. Taking advantage of the full\nwavelength range of the available echelle data, it will be possible to determine the radial\nvelocity curve of both components with much higher confidence.\nReferences\nHadrava 1995, A&AS 114, 393\nHummel, White, Elias, Hajian, Nordgren 2000 ApJ 540, L91\n\n\f"}
