R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\nAbstract. Semiclassical limits of generic multiparameter quantized coordinate\nrings A = Oq (k n ) of affine spaces are constructed and related to A, for k an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and q a multiplicatively antisymmetric\nmatrix whose entries generate a torsionfree subgroup of k \u00d7 . A semiclassical limit\nof A is a Poisson algebra structure on the corresponding classical coordinate ring\nR = O(k n ), and results of Oh, Park, Shin and the authors are used to construct\nhomeomorphisms from the Poisson prime and Poisson primitive spectra of R onto\nthe prime and primitive spectra of A. The Poisson primitive spectrum of R is then\nidentified with the space of symplectic cores in k n in the sense of Brown and Gordon, and an example is presented (over C) for which the Poisson primitive spectrum\nof R is not homeomorphic to the space of symplectic leaves in k n . Finally, these\nresults are extended from quantum affine spaces to quantum affine toric varieties.\n\n1. Introduction\nThis paper is a study of ideal theory in quantum affine n-space and, more generally, in quantum toric varieties. The focus is on the relationship between the prime\nand primitive spectra of these noncommutative algebras and the Poisson spectra of\ncorresponding commutative semiclassical limits.\n1.1. History and context. A basic principle of the orbit method is that given a\nnoncommutative algebra A, one should associate to A an algebraic variety V with a\nPoisson structure and should relate the primitive ideals of A to the symplectic leaves\nin V . This idea first arose in Lie theory, with the enveloping algebras A = U(g)\nof finite dimensional complex Lie algebras g providing fundamental examples. The\nsymmetric algebra S(g) has a Poisson bracket induced from the Lie bracket on g,\nand the identification of S(g) with the coordinate ring O(g\u2217 ) turns the affine space\ng\u2217 into a Poisson variety, equipped with the KKS Poisson structure. In this setting,\nthe Poisson algebra S(g) = O(g\u2217 ) is the semiclassical limit of U(g), because its\nPoisson bracket can be obtained from the identification of this algebra with the\nassociated graded algebra of U(g) (with respect to the standard filtration). (See 1.4\nbelow for the semiclassical limit process.) A famous theorem of Kirillov, Kostant, and\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 16W35; 16D60, 17B63, 20G42.\nResearch of the first author supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, and\nresearch of the second author by a grant from the National Security Agency. This research was also\npartially supported by Leverhulme Research Interchange Grant F/00158/X (UK).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nK. R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\nSouriau shows that the symplectic leaves in g\u2217 coincide with the coadjoint orbits of\nthe associated simply connected Lie group. If g is solvable and algebraic, the Dixmier\nmap gives a homeomorphism from the space of symplectic leaves of g\u2217 (equipped with\nthe quotient Zariski topology) onto the primitive ideal space Prim U(g).\nAnalogous patterns are posited for quantum groups (for which a variant of the\nsemiclassical limit is appropriate), particularly for quantized coordinate rings of algebraic varieties (e.g., [10, Introduction]). One quickly sees, via examples, that the best\nresults are to be expected in generic cases (meaning that appropriate parameters are\nnot roots of unity). Here a fundamental test case is Oq (G), the standard single parameter quantized coordinate ring of a complex semisimple algebraic group G. Hodges\nand Levasseur [10],[11], working with G = SLn (C), and Joseph [13],[14], extending\ntheir results to general G, constructed bijections from the space of symplectic leaves\nin G (relative to the semiclassical limit Poisson structure) onto the primitive ideal\nspace of Oq (G). It is an open problem (solved only in the easy case G = SL2 (C))\nwhether homeomorphisms can be constructed. The problem may be alternatively\nexpressed in terms of topological quotients. The results of Hodges-Levasseur and\nJoseph give surjections G \u2192 Prim Oq (G) whose fibers are the symplectic leaves in G,\nand the question becomes: Does there exist such a surjection for which Prim Oq (G)\nhas the quotient topology?\nThe present authors raised the corresponding problem for other quantized coordinate rings in the following form [6], [9]: If A is a generic quantized coordinate ring\nof an algebraic variety V , is Prim A a topological quotient of V , and is the prime\nspectrum Spec A a topological quotient of Spec O(V )? They proved that these indeed hold for quantum tori and quantum affine spaces [9]. (In fact, these results\nhold in non-generic cases as well, modulo a small technical assumption.) Later, Oh,\nPark, and Shin [17] showed that the maps constructed in [9] induce homeomorphisms\nfrom the spaces of Poisson primitive and Poisson prime ideals in coordinate rings of\ntori and affine spaces onto the primitive and prime spectra of corresponding generic\nquantized coordinate rings. However, the Poisson structures in these results were not\nexhibited as semiclassical limits.\n1.2. Results of this paper. Our purposes here are threefold. First, we construct a\nsemiclassical limit R = O(k n ) of the quantum coordinate ring A = Oq (k n ), when the\nquantizing parameters generate a torsionfree group, such that the above-cited results\nof Oh, Park and Shin can be applied to give homeomorphisms, respectively, from\nthe Poisson prime and Poisson primitive spectra of R onto the prime and primitive\nspectra of A. Furthermore, since our homeomorphisms occur in generic settings,\nthe explicit descriptions of the maps involved can be somewhat simplified, and we\ntake the opportunity to do so. Second, we show that the Poisson primitive ideals\noccurring in the coordinate rings O(k n ) here correspond to the Poisson cores in the\naffine space k n , in the sense of Brown and Gordon [5], and do not always correspond\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n3\n\nto symplectic leaves in general (over C). Finally, we extend the preceding results to\nquantum affine toric varieties, as we did for topological quotients in [6] and [9].\n1.3. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the semiclassical limit is constructed. In Section 3, the homeomorphisms are presented. Also in Section 3 is\nan example showing that primitive ideals and symplectic leaves do not necessarily\ncorrespond bijectively. In Section 4, the special case in which the qij are all powers\nof single parameter is considered. Section 5, finally, contains the generalizations to\nquantum affine toric varieties and related algebras.\n1.4. Recall that a Poisson algebra over a field k is a commutative k-algebra R\nequipped with a Poisson\nbracket, that is, a k-bilinear map {\u2212, \u2212} : R \u00d7 R \u2192 R\n\u0001\nsuch that R, {\u2212, \u2212} is a Lie algebra and such that {\u2212, \u2212} is a derivation in each\nvariable. These can arise as semiclassical limits in the following two ways.\nFirst, suppose that A is a nonnegatively filtered k-algebra whose associated graded\nring, R = gr A, is commutative. Given homogeneous elements r \u2208 gri A and s \u2208\ngrj A, choose representatives r\u0302 \u2208 Ai and \u015d \u2208 Aj . The commutativity of R implies\nthat [r\u0302, \u015d] \u2208 Ai+j\u22121 , and we set {r, s} equal to the coset of [r\u0302, \u015d] in gri+j\u22121 A. This\nprovides a well-defined Poisson bracket on R, and the resulting Poisson algebra is\ncalled the semiclassical limit of A.\nFor the second construction, suppose that A is a k-algebra and that h \u2208 A is a\ncentral non-zero-divisor such that R = A/hA is commutative. Given any r, s \u2208 R,\nchoose representatives r\u0302, \u015d \u2208 A. Then [r\u0302, \u015d] is uniquely divisible by h in A, and we\nset {r, s} equal to the coset h1 [r\u0302, \u015d] + hA in R. We again obtain a well-defined Poisson\nbracket on R, and this Poisson algebra is viewed as the semiclassical limit of A. The\nalgebra A may be thought of as a family of deformations of R, namely the algebras\nAq = A/(h \u2212 q)A for q \u2208 k. By abuse of terminology, R is also referred to as a\nsemiclassical limit of one of the algebras Aq , when q is suitably generic.\n2. Construction of the Semiclassical Limit\nSetup 2.1. Assume throughout the paper that:\n(i) k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero (with group of units k \u00d7 ).\n(ii) q 6= 0, 1 is an element of k.\n(iii) n is a positive integer, and q = (qij ) is a multiplicatively antisymmetric n\u00d7n\n\u22121\nmatrix over k (i.e., qii = 1 and qij = qji\n\u2208 k \u00d7 for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n).\n(iv) The multiplicative subgroup hqij i = hqij | 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 ni of k \u00d7 is torsion free.\n(Note that the rank of this free abelian group can be no larger than n(n \u2212 1)/2.)\n(v) A = Oq (k n ) is the k-algebra presented by generators x1 , . . . , xn and relations\nxi xj = qij xj xi , for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. This algebra is commonly referred to as a multiparameter quantum affine n-space over k.\n(vi) K = k[z]h(z\u22121)(z\u2212q)i is the localization of a polynomial ring k[z] at the semimaximal ideal h(z \u2212 1)(z \u2212 q)i. (If desired, K can be replaced by a finitely generated\n\n\f4\n\nK. R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\nsubalgebra, as noted in (2.6).) Write K \u00d7 for the group of units of K. Note that there\nare well-defined evaluation maps\n\u03b31 : K \u2192 k\n\nand\n\n\u03b3q : K \u2192 k,\n\ngiven by \u03b31 (f ) = f (1) and \u03b3q (f ) = f (q). Moreover, if f \u2208 K \u00d7 , then \u03b31 (f ), \u03b3q (f ) \u2208 k \u00d7 .\nOur goal is to realize Spec A via a suitable semiclassical limit. Our approach\ndepends essentially on [17], which in turn relied on [8],[9],[16].\n2.2. (Following [9, \u00a74] and [8, \u00a71]; cf. [4, \u00a74].)\n(i) Let \u0393 = Zn , with standard basis elements \u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebn . For s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) and\nt = (t1 , . . . , tn ) in \u0393, set\nn\nY\nst\nqiji j .\n\u03c3(s, t) =\ni,j=1\n\n\u00d7\n\nThen \u03c3 : \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192 k is an alternating bicharacter:\n\u03c3(s, s) = 1,\n\n\u03c3(s, t) = \u03c3(t, s)\u22121 ,\n\n\u03c3(s, t + u) = \u03c3(s, t)\u03c3(s, u),\n\nfor s, t, u \u2208 \u0393. Moreover, the subgroup him \u03c3i of k \u00d7 is equal to hqij i.\n(ii) Let \u0393+ denote the submonoid of \u0393 of n-tuples without negative entries. For\ns = (s1 , . . . , sn ) and t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) in \u0393+ , let xs denote the monomial\nxs11 * * * xsnn \u2208 A.\nNote, for all s, t \u2208 \u0393+ , that\nxs xt = \u03c3(s, t)xt xs .\nAlso note that qij = \u03c3(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ), for 1 \u2264 i, j, \u2264 n.\n2.3. Since hqij i is torsion free, \u22121 \u2208\n/ hqij i. Hence, it follows from [9, Lemma 4.2] that\nthere exists an alternating bicharacter c : \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192 k \u00d7 such that \u03c3(s, t) = c(s, t)2 , for\nall s, t \u2208 \u0393, and such that \u03c3(s, t) = 1 if and only if c(s, t) = 1. In the proof of [9,\nLemma 4.2], c is constructed so that the subgroup \u039b = him ci of k \u00d7 is contained in a\ndivisible hull of hqij i. Since hqij i is torsionfree, so is its divisible hull, and therefore\n\u039b is torsionfree.\n2.4. We now form the twisted monoid algebra k c \u0393+ , with k-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ },\nand with multiplication given via xs \u2217 xt = c(s, t)xs+t , for s, t \u2208 \u0393+ . (The notational\noverlap with (2.2ii) will be resolved momentarily.) Note that\nxs \u2217 xt = c(s, t)2 xt \u2217 xs = \u03c3(s, t)xt \u2217 xs\nfor s, t \u2208 \u0393+ . Hence, the assignment xi 7\u2192 x\u01ebi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, induces an isomorphism\nfrom A onto k c \u0393+ .\nHenceforth, we identify A with k c \u0393+ , via the above isomorphism. In particular,\nthe monomial xs of (2.2ii), for s \u2208 \u0393+ , is identified with the basis element xs of k c \u0393+ .\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n5\n\n2.5.

The rule \u03c8(f ) = f \u2032 (1) gives a well-defined injective group homomorphism\nf (z)7\u2192f \u2032 (1)\ne \u2212\u2212\n\u03c8:\u039b\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k + .\n\nProof. Observe that K is closed under formal differentiation, and so f \u2032 (1) is defined\ne to k. Now fi (1) = 1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m,\nfor f \u2208 K. Thus, \u03c8 is a well defined map from \u039b\ne Therefore, for all f, g \u2208 \u039b,\ne\nand so f (1) = 1 for all f \u2208 \u039b.\n\u03c8(f g) = f \u2032 (1)g(1) + f (1)g \u2032(1) = f \u2032 (1) + g \u2032(1) = \u03c8(f ) + \u03c8(g),\n\nproving that \u03c8 is a group homomorphism. Second, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m,\n\u03c8(fi ) = fi\u2032 (1) = \u03bci .\nSince \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcm are Z-linearly independent, we conclude that \u03c8 is injective.\n\n\u0003\n\ne = K c\u0303 \u0393+ , the twisted monoid K-algebra with K-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ }\n2.9. Now set R\nand multiplication given via xs \u2217 xt = c\u0303(s, t)xs+t , for s, t \u2208 \u0393+ . We again use xi to\ndenote x\u01ebi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nRecall that qij = \u03c3(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = c(\u01ebi , \u01ebj )2 , for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and set\nq\u0303ij = q\u0303ij (z) = c\u0303(\u01ebi , \u01ebj )2 \u2208 K \u00d7 .\nThen\n\ne = Khx1 , . . . , xn | xi \u2217 xj = q\u0303ij xj \u2217 xi for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 ni.\nR\nFor \u03bc \u2208 k \u00d7 , set\ne\nR\u03bc = R/hz\n\u2212 \u03bci.\n\u223c\nWe see that Rq = A, since\nq\u0303ij (q) = \u03b3q (q\u0303ij ) = \u03b3q c\u0303(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = c(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = qij\nfor all i, j, and we use this isomorphism to identify A with Rq . Under this identification, the cosets xi + hz \u2212 qi \u2208 Rq correspond to the elements xi \u2208 A.\n2.10. Next, consider the group homomorphism\nf (z)7\u2192f (1)\n\n\u03b31 : K \u00d7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k \u00d7 .\ne = 1 and, in particular, that \u03b31 (c\u0303(s, t)) = 1 for all s, t \u2208 \u0393.

We also identify R and R1 with the commutative monoid algebra k\u0393+ , with k-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ } and multiplication given\nby xs xt = xs+t for s, t \u2208 \u0393+ .\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n7\n\ne\ne\nSince R/hz\n\u2212 1i = R is commutative and z \u2212 1 is a central non-zero-divisor in R,\nthere is a Poisson bracket on R as in (1.4), and R becomes the semiclassical limit of\nA = Rq (or, more accurately, the semiclassical limit of the family of algebras R\u03bc ).\nThe Poisson bracket on R is given by\n{a, b} =\n\nab \u2212 ba\nz\u22121\n\nz=1\n\ne where a and b denote the cosets of a and b in R. In particular,\nfor all a, b \u2208 R,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\u0303ij (z) \u2212 1\n{xi , xj } =\nxi xj = q\u0303ij\u2032 (1)xi xj\nz \u2212 1 z=1\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. (The last equality holds because q\u0303ij (1) = \u03b31 (q\u0303ij ) = 1.)\nWe treat R as a Poisson algebra in this way, for the remainder of the paper. In\nthe notation of [17, 3.1], R = ku \u0393+ , where u : \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192 k is the alternating biadditive\nmap such that u(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = q\u0303ij\u2032 (1), for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. In this notation,\n{xs , xt } = u(s, t)xs xt\nfor s, t \u2208 \u0393+ .\n3. The Homeomorphisms\nRetain the notation of the previous section. In particular,\nA = Rq = khx1 , . . . , xn | xi xj = qij xj xi for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 ni\nis as in (2.9), with qij = q\u0303ij (q), and\nR = R1 = k[x1 , . . . , xn ]\nis the Poisson algebra with bracket\n{xi , xj } = q\u0303ij\u2032 (1)xi xj ,\nfollowing (2.10). In particular, R is a semiclassical limit of A.\n3.1. (Following [5],[7],[16],[17].) An ideal I of R is a Poisson ideal if {R, I} \u2286 I. We\nlet PSpec R denote the (Zariski) subspace of Spec R comprised of the prime Poisson\nideals. Each maximal ideal m of R contains a unique largest Poisson ideal P(m),\ncalled the Poisson core of m. The Poisson cores of the maximal ideals of R are\ntermed Poisson primitive ideals [5, 3.2] (or symplectic ideals [16, Definition 1.2]) and\nare prime ([5, 3.2] or [16, Lemma 1.3]). The subspace of PSpec R consisting of the\nPoisson primitive ideals will be denoted PPrim R. The Poisson center Zp (R) is the\nset of z \u2208 R such that {R, z} = 0.\nIn our main result, Theorem 3.6, we will describe a homeomorphism from PSpec R\nonto Spec A.\n\n\f8\n\nK. R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\n3.2. To proceed further, we need more of the notation of [17].\n(i) Let W denote the set of subsets of {1, . . . , n}, and let w \u2208 W .\n(ii) Let Iw denote the ideal of R generated by the xi for i \u2208 w, and let Yw denote\nthe multiplicatively closed subset of R/Iw generated by 1 and the cosets of the xj for\nj\u2208\n/ w. Let Rw denote the localization of R/Iw at Yw . We let each xi also denote its\nimage in Rw .\n(iii) Let \u0393w denote the subgroup of \u0393 generated by the basis elements \u01ebj for j \u2208\n/ w,\nand let cw denote the restriction of c, defined in (2.3), to \u0393w \u00d7 \u0393w .\n(iv) Identify Rw with the group algebra k\u0393w , via xj \u2194 x\u01ebj , for j \u2208\n/ w.\n(v) Set H = Hom(\u0393, k \u00d7 ), which is a group under pointwise multiplication, isomorphic to the algebraic torus (k \u00d7 )n . This group acts on R = k\u0393+ and on Rw = k\u0393w by\nk-algebra automorphisms such that\nh.xs = hh, sihs ,\nfor h \u2208 H and s \u2208 \u0393+ or s \u2208 \u0393w . Further, set\nSw = rad(cw ) = {s \u2208 \u0393w | cw (s, t) = 1 for all t \u2208 \u0393w },\nSw\u22a5 = {h \u2208 H | hh, si = 1 for all s \u2208 Sw }.\nThen Sw\u22a5 is a subgroup of H, and it acts on both R and Rw through the H-action.\nTo match the notation of [6, 3.4], let \u03c3w denote the restriction of \u03c3 = c2 to \u0393w .\nThe conditions on c in (2.3) then imply that\nSw = {s \u2208 \u0393w | \u03c3w (s, t) = 1 for all t \u2208 \u0393w } = rad(\u03c3w ).\n(vi) Let Specw R denote the set of prime ideals of R that contain xi for i \u2208 w\nbut do not contain xj for j \u2208\n/ w. Localization provides a natural homeomorphism\nbetween Specw R and Spec Rw , and this homeomorphism is H-equivariant.\n(vii) For P \u2208 Specw R, let (P : Sw\u22a5 ) denote the intersection of the prime ideals in\nthe Sw\u22a5 -orbit of P .\n3.3. Both R and A have k-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ }. We will use \u03a6 : A \u2192 R to denote the\nk-linear isomorphism such that \u03a6(xs ) = xs for all s \u2208 \u0393+ .\n3.4. (i) For w \u2208 W , set\nPSpecw R = PSpec R \u2229 Specw R\nPPrimw R = PPrim R \u2229 Specw R.\n(ii) The maps PSpec R \u2192 Spec A and PPrim R \u2192 Prim A used in [17, Theorem\n3.5] are defined by the formula\nP 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P : Sw\u22a5 ).\nfor w \u2208 W and P \u2208 PSpecw R. Moreover, as mentioned in the proof of [17, Proposition 3.4], (P : Sw\u22a5 ) = P for all P \u2208 PSpecw R under our present hypotheses, and so\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n9\n\nthe formula reduces to\nP 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P ).\nSince this key point is somewhat hidden in [17], we excerpt the result and its proof\nin the next lemma. Before doing so, however, we need one more ingredient:\n(iii) Recall the isomorphism \u03b3q of (2.7) and the homomorphism \u03c8 of (2.8). Let \u03c6\ndenote the composite homomorphism\n\u03b3q\u22121\n\nf 7\u2192f 2\n\n\u03c8\n\ne \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u039b\ne \u2212\u2212\u2192 k + ,\n\u039b \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u039b\n\nwhich is injective because \u03c6(\u03bbi ) = \u03c8(fi2 ) = 2\u03bci for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Recalling u from\n(2.10), observe that\n\u0001\n\u03c6(c(\u01ebi , \u01ebj )) = \u03c8 \u03b3q\u22121 (c(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ))2 = \u03c8\u03b3q\u22121 (qij ) = \u03c8(q\u0303ij ) = q\u0303ij\u2032 (1) = u(\u01ebi , \u01ebj )\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and so u = \u03c6c.\n\nLemma 3.5. [17] Let w \u2208 W , and let P be a Poisson prime ideal in Specw R. Then\nP is stable under the action of Sw\u22a5 . Consequently, P = (P : Sw\u22a5 ).\nProof. Let uw denote the restriction of u to \u0393w , and note that uw = \u03c6cw . The induced\nPoisson structure on the localization Rw = k\u0393w satisfies\n{xs , xt } = uw (s, t)xs xt\nfor s, t \u2208 \u0393+\nw , and so we have Rw = kuw \u0393.\nThe Poisson prime ideal P/Iw in R/Iw induces a Poisson prime ideal Q in Rw ,\nwhich contracts to a prime ideal Q\u2032 in the Poisson center Zp (Rw ). By [18, Lemma\n1.2] (which is valid over any base field of characteristic zero), Q is generated by Q\u2032 ,\nand Zp (Rw ) equals the group algebra of the radical of uw . However,\nrad(uw ) = {s \u2208 \u0393w | uw (s, t) = 0 for all t \u2208 \u0393w } = rad(cw ) = Sw ,\nbecause uw = \u03c6cw and \u03c6 is injective. Thus, Zp (Rw ) = kSw . By definition of Sw\u22a5 , this\ngroup acts trivially on kSw , and so it fixes Q\u2032 (pointwise). Therefore Sw\u22a5 stabilizes\nQ, hence also P/Iw , and finally P .\n\u0003\nWe now apply [17, Theorem 3.5]. Note that the following theorem asserts, in\nparticular, that the linear map \u03a6\u22121 : R \u2192 A sends Poisson prime ideals of R to\nprime ideals of A.\nTheorem 3.6. Let A = Oq (k n ), where k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and where q = (qij ) is a multiplicatively antisymmetric n \u00d7 n matrix\nover k such that the group hqij i \u2286 k \u00d7 is torsionfree. Let R = k[x1 , . . . , xn ], equipped\nwith the Poisson structure described in (2.10), and let \u03a6 : A \u2192 R be the k-linear\nisomorphism of (3.3). Then the rule P 7\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P ) determines a homeomorphism\nPSpec R \u2212\u2192 Spec A,\nwhich restricts to a homeomorphism\nPPrim R \u2212\u2192 Prim A.\n\n\f10\n\nK. R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\nProof. We have a homomorphism \u03c6, from (3.4iii), and an alternating biadditive map\nu, from (2.10), exactly as described in [17, 2.3]. We can identify R as a Poisson kalgebra with ku \u0393+ , following the notation of [17, 3.1]; see (2.10). Similarly, we have\nidentified A as a k-algebra with k c \u0393+ , also following the notation of [17, 3.1]; see\n(2.4). The theorem now follows directly from Lemma 3.5 and [17, Theorem 3.5]. \u0003\n3.7. (i) Identify the affine space k n with the maximal ideal space of R. The rule\nm 7\u2192 P(m) gives a surjective map k n \u2192 PPrim R, the fibers of which are called\nsymplectic cores [5, 3.3], and are algebraic analogs of symplectic leaves (cf. [5, 3.3,\n3.5, 3.7]). Specifically, the symplectic core containing a point m is the set\nC(m) = {m\u2032 \u2208 k n | P(m\u2032 ) = P(m)}.\n(ii) Let SympCr k n denote the set of symplectic cores in k n . The rule m 7\u2192 C(m)\ngives a surjective map k n \u2192 SympCr k n , and we give SympCr k n the quotient\n(Zariski) topology via this map. By the definition of symplectic cores, there is a\nbijection SympCr k n \u2192 PPrim R such that C(m) 7\u2192 P(m) for m \u2208 k n .\n(iii) It follows from [7, Theorem 4.1(b)] that the Zariski topology on PPrim R is\nthe quotient topology from the canonical map k n \u2192 PPrim R in (i). (To verify the\nhypotheses of [7, Theorem 4.1(b)], observe that the action of the torus H on R is a\nrational action by Poisson automorphisms, and observe that R has only finitely many\nH-stable prime Poisson ideals, namely the ideals Iw of (3.2ii).) Hence, the bijection\nSympCr k n \u2192 PPrim R of (ii) is a homeomorphism.\nCombining these observations with Theorem 3.6, we obtain\nCorollary 3.8. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 3.6, there is a homeomorphism\nSympCr k n \u2212\u2192 Prim A\ngiven by the rule C(m) 7\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P(m)).\nThe symplectic cores C(m), which make up the points of the space SympCr k n\nin Corollary 3.8, have good geometric structure themselves: they are homogeneous\nsmooth irreducible quasi-affine varieties, as the following corollary shows. In keeping\nwith the notation of (3.4i), set\nMaxw R = Max R \u2229 Specw R\nfor w \u2208 W . Since we have identified Max R with k n , the sets Maxw R partition k n .\nCorollary 3.9. Let w \u2208 W and m \u2208 Maxw R. Then the symplectic core C(m) is a\nsmooth irreducible locally closed subset of k n , and it equals the Sw\u22a5 -orbit of m in k n .\nProof. Irreducibility and local closedness will follow from [5, Lemma 3.3] once we\nknow that all Poisson primitive ideals of R are locally closed points in PSpec R. The\nlatter fact will follow from the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence of [7, Theorem\n4.3]. As we have already noted in (3.7iii), the torus H acts rationally on R by Poisson\nautomorphisms, and there are only finitely many H-stable Poisson prime ideals in R.\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n11\n\nHence, the hypotheses of [7, Theorem 4.3] are satisfied. Investing that theorem into\n[5, Lemma 3.3], we find that C(m) is locally closed and that its closure is the set\n{m\u2032 \u2208 Max R | m\u2032 \u2287 P(m)},\nwhich is irreducible because P(m) is a prime ideal. Therefore C(m) is irreducible. [5,\nLemma 3.3] also shows that C(m) is smooth in its closure. Smoothness in k n will\nfollow from the general theory of algebraic group actions (e.g., [2, Proposition 1.8]),\nonce we exhibit C(m) as an orbit of an algebraic group.\nThe Sw\u22a5 -orbit of m appears as the fiber of the quotient map Max R \u2192 Prim A in\n[9, Theorem 4.11]. Hence, we need to show that this quotient map, call it \u03bc, agrees\nwith the one obtained in our present setting, namely the map\n\u03c4 : k n \u2212\u2192 Prim A,\n\nm 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P(m)),\n\nwhich is the composition of the homeomorphism in Corollary 3.8 with the quotient\nmap k n \u2192 SympCr k n . By construction, the fibers of \u03c4 are the symplectic cores in\nkn.\nSince m \u2208 Maxw R, [17, Proposition 3.4] shows that (m : Sw\u22a5 ) = (P : Sw\u22a5 ) for some\nP \u2208 PSpecw R. But (P : Sw\u22a5 ) = P by Lemma 3.5, and so (m : Sw\u22a5 ) = P is a Poisson\nprimitive ideal. In particular, (m : Sw\u22a5 ) is a Poisson ideal contained in m, whence\n(m : Sw\u22a5 ) \u2286 P(m). On the other hand, the Poisson primitive ideal P(m) is Sw\u22a5 -stable\nby Lemma 3.5. Since it is contained in m, it must be contained in (m : Sw\u22a5 ). Therefore\nP(m) = (m : Sw\u22a5 ), and we conclude that\n\u03c4 (m) = \u03a6\u22121 (m : Sw\u22a5 ).\nThis shows that \u03c4 agrees with \u03bc, as desired. By [9, Theorem 4.11], the fibers of \u03bc\nover points in Primw A consist precisely of the Sw\u22a5 -orbits within k n . Therefore C(m)\nequals the Sw\u22a5 -orbit of m.\nNote from its definition that Sw\u22a5 is a closed subgroup of the torus H, so that it\nis an affine algebraic group. Since H acts rationally on R, its induced action on\nMax R = k n is morphic, as is the corresponding action of Sw\u22a5 . Standard results\n(e.g., [2, Proposition 1.8]) thus imply that the Sw\u22a5 -orbit C(m) is smooth (and locally\nclosed).\n\u0003\nWhen k = C, an affine variety equipped with a Poisson structure can also be\npartitioned into symplectic leaves (e.g., see [5, 3.5]), and it has been a goal of research\nin quantum groups to represent primitive spectra of quantized algebras as spaces\nof symplectic leaves. This correspondence between primitive ideals and symplectic\nleaves, however, can break down when the symplectic leaves are not algebraic (i.e., not\nlocally closed in the Zariski topology), as noted by Hodges-Levasseur-Toro [12, p. 52],\nVancliff [18, Theorem 3.8], and Brandl [3, Example 6.4]. The following provides an\nexplicit example of this phenomenon, in the form of a quantum affine 3-space.\nExample 3.10. (i) Let k = C, choose \u03b1 \u2208 R \\ Q, and choose q \u2208 C transcendental\nover the field Q(\u03b1). We would like to construct an example of the form Oq (C3 ), with\n\n\f12\n\nK. R.

To replace z \u03b1 , we use the\nfirst-order Taylor approximation 1 + \u03b1(z \u2212 1), and consequently we use 1 + \u03b1(q \u2212 1)\nin place of q \u03b1 in the defining relations for this example. Because q is transcendental\nover Q(\u03b1), the elements \u03bb1 = q and \u03bb2 = 1+\u03b1(q \u22121) generate a free abelian subgroup\nof C\u00d7 of rank 2.\nWe now take\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 \u03bb21 \u03bb22\n1 1\uf8fb\nq = \uf8f0\u03bb\u22122\n1\n\u22122\n\u03bb2\n1 1\nand form A = Oq (C3 ).\n(ii) The primitive spectrum of A is easily calculated by the methods of [8], as\nfollows. Let W denote the set of subsets of {1, 2, 3}, and for w \u2208 W set\nJw = hxi | i \u2208 wi \u2208 Spec A\nAw = (A/Jw )[x\u22121\n/ w]\nj | j \u2208\nPrimw A = {P \u2208 Prim A | P \u2229 {x1 , x2 , x3 } = {xi | i \u2208 w} }\nY\nSw = {a \u2208 Z3 | ai = 0 for i \u2208 w and\nqijai = 1 for all j \u2208\n/ w}.\ni\u2208w\n/\n\nThen Prim A is the disjoint union of the sets Primw A, and each Primw A is homeomorphic to Prim Aw via localization and contraction [8, Theorem 2.3]. Moreover,\nsince Aw is a quantum torus, Prim Aw consists precisely of the ideals induced from\nmaximal ideals of the center Z(Aw ) [8, Corollary 1.5], and Z(Aw ) is spanned by the\n(cosets of the) monomials xa for a \u2208 Sw (e.g., [8, Lemma 1.2]). In particular, when\nZ(Aw ) = C (equivalently, when Aw is simple), Primw A consists of just the ideal Jw .\nIn the present example, this occurs in the cases w = \u2205, {2}, {3}, {1, 2, 3}. Hence,\nPrim\u2205 A = {h0i}\nPrim{3} A = {hx3 i}\n\nPrim{2} A = {hx2 i}\nPrim{1,2,3} A = {hx1 , x2 , x3 i}.\n\nIn the remaining four cases, Aw is a commutative Laurent polynomial ring over C,\nand so we obtain\nPrim{1} A = {hx1 , x2 \u2212 b, x3 \u2212 ci | b, c \u2208 C\u00d7 }\nPrim{1,2} A = {hx1 , x2 , x3 \u2212 ci | c \u2208 C\u00d7 }\nPrim{1,3} A = {hx1 , x2 \u2212 b, x3 i | b \u2208 C\u00d7 }\nPrim{2,3} A = {hx1 \u2212 a, x2 , x3 i | a \u2208 C\u00d7 }.\nHence, Prim A may be pictured as follows:\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n13\n\n* * * hx1 \u2212a, x2 , x3 i * * * * * * hx1 , x2 \u2212b, x3 i * * * * * * hx1 , x2 , x3 \u2212ci * * * * * * hx1 , x2 \u2212b, x3 \u2212ci * * *\n(a \u2208 C) T\n(b \u2208 C)\n(c \u2208 C)\n(b, c \u2208 C\u00d7 )\n== TTT\n==\nj\nu\nTTTT\njjjj\n==\n==\nj\nuu\nj\nj\nT\nj\nTTTT\nuu\n==\n==jjj\nu\nTTTT jjjj =\n==\nuu\n==\nTjTjTT\nuu\n==\nj\nu\nj\n=\nj\nT\nu\nj\nTTTT\nuu\njjjj\nuu\nu\nhx2 i N\nhx3 i\nu\nuu\nNNN\nuu\nNNN\nu\nu\nNNN\nuu\nNNN\nuu\nu\nu\nNNN\nuu\nNN\nuu\n\nh0i\n\n(iii) In setting up the semiclassical limit, we may choose c as in (2.3) so that\nc(\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 ) = \u03bb1 ,\n\nc(\u01eb1 , \u01eb3 ) = \u03bb2 ,\n\nc(\u01eb2 , \u01eb3 ) = 1.\n\nIn view of (i), the group \u039b = him ci is free abelian with a basis \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 . Since \u03b1 is\nirrational, we may (and do) choose \u03bc1 = 1 and \u03bc2 = \u03b1. The polynomials fi of (2.6)\nare then given by\nf1 (z) = z,\n\nf2 (z) = 1 + \u03b1(z \u2212 1),\n\nwhence q\u030312 (z) = z 2 and q\u030313 (z) = (1 + \u03b1(z \u2212 1))2 , while q\u030323 (z) = 1. Consequently,\n\u2032\nq\u030312\n(1) = 2,\n\n\u2032\nq\u030313\n(1) = 2\u03b1,\n\n\u2032\nq\u030323\n(1) = 0.\n\n(iv) The semiclassical limit of A in this example is thus R = C[x1 , x2 , x3 ], equipped\nwith the Poisson structure such that\n{x1 , x2 } = 2x1 x2 ,\n\n{x1 , x3 } = 2\u03b1x1 x3 ,\n\n{x2 , x3 } = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic analog of the KKS Poisson structure on the dual of the standard\nexample of a non-algebraic solvable Lie algebra (eg., cf. [19, Example 2.43]).\nThe Poisson primitive ideals of R can be computed via the Poisson analog of the\nmethods of [8] \u2013 see [7, Theorems 4.2, 4.3]. These ideals are given by the same sets\nof generators as the primitive ideals of A described in (ii); in particular, the picture\nof Prim A obtained there serves also as a picture of PPrim R. From this picture, we\nread off that the symplectic cores in C3 for the Poisson structure under consideration\nare the following sets:\n\u2022 The individual points on the x1 -axis;\n\u2022 The individual points in the x2 x3 -plane;\n\u2022 The x1 x2 -plane with the x1 - and x2 -axes removed;\n\u2022 The x1 x3 -plane with the x1 - and x3 -axes removed;\n\u2022 The space C3 with the three coordinate planes removed.\n(v) Finally, we indicate how to find the symplectic leaves for this Poisson structure\non C3 . These are not all algebraic, just as in the case of the KKS Poisson structure on\nthe dual of a non-algebraic solvable Lie algebra (cf. [19, Example 2.43 and discussion\n\n\f14\n\nK. R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\non p. 67] and [5, Remark 1, p. 203]). We first recall from [5, Proposition 3.6(1)] that\neach symplectic core is a union of symplectic leaves. This immediately implies that\nthose individual points which are symplectic cores are also symplectic leaves. We\ndetermine the other leaves by considering Hamiltonian paths, as follows.\nIn full, the Poisson bracket on R is given by the formula\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n\u2202f \u2202g\n+ 2\u03b1x1 x3\n,\n\u2212\n\u2212\n{f, g} = 2x1 x2\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2 \u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\u2202x1 \u2202x3 \u2202x3 \u2202x1\nwhich also defines the unique extension of the bracket to the algebra S of smooth\ncomplex functions on C3 . For f \u2208 S, the derivation Hf = {f, \u2212} on S gives a smooth\nvector field on C3 , and the flows (integral curves) of such vector fields Hf are the\nHamiltonian paths for the given Poisson structure. (Specifically, a flow of Hf is a\npath c(t) = (x1 (t), x2 (t), x3 (t)) such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u010b(t) = Hf c(t) = \u22122x1 x2\n,\n\u2212 2\u03b1x1 x3\n, 2x1 x2\n, 2\u03b1x1 x3\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x1\nwhere the dot stands for d/dt.) By definition [20, p. 529], the symplectic leaves of\nC3 are the equivalence classes for the relation 'connected by piecewise Hamiltonian\npaths'.\nPaths of the form c(t) = (a, beat , ce\u03b1at ) with a, b, c \u2208 C are flows of Hx1 /2 , and paths\nc(t) = (aebt , b, c) with a, b, c \u2208 C are flows of H\u2212x2 /2 . It follows that the third and\nfourth of the symplectic cores listed in (iv) are connected with respect to piecewise\nHamiltonian paths, and hence these cores are also symplectic leaves. Moreover, each\nof the surfaces\n\u03a3d = {(a1 , a2 , a3 ) \u2208 (C\u00d7 )3 | a3 = da\u03b12 },\nfor d \u2208 C\u00d7 , is connected with respect to piecewise Hamiltonian paths. On the other\nhand, any Hamiltonian path within (C\u00d7 )3 must satisfy \u1e8b3 (t)/x3 (t) = \u03b1\u1e8b2 (t)/x2 (t)\nand so must be contained within one of the \u03a3d . Therefore the \u03a3d are the remaining\nsymplectic leaves of C3 . These form a one-parameter family of non-algebraic surfaces\nwhose union is a single symplectic core.\nWe conclude that while Prim A is homeomorphic to SympCr C3 (Corollary 3.8), it\nis not homeomorphic to the space of symplectic leaves in C3 . For instance, Prim A\nhas just one dense point, while the space of symplectic leaves in C3 (equipped with\nthe quotient Zariski topology) has uncountably many.\n4. Uniparameter Quantum Affine Spaces\nThe Poisson structure on k n in Theorem 3.6 can be given more explicitly in the\nuniparameter case, namely when the scalars qij are powers of a single scalar which is\nnot a root of unity. We treat this scalar as a square (as we may, since k is algebraically\nclosed), and write it in the form q 2 to match our existing notation.\n\n\fSEMICLASSICAL LIMITS OF QUANTUM AFFINE SPACES\n\n15\n\n4.1. (i) Assume that the scalar q \u2208 k \u00d7 is not a root of unity. Let r = (rij ) be an\nadditively antisymmetric n\u00d7n matrix over Z, and take qij = q 2rij for all i, j. Assume\nthat r 6= 0, so that at least one qij 6= 1.\n(ii) Under the present assumptions, the natural choice for the multiplicatively\nantisymmetric bicharacter c, as in (2.3), is to define it so that\nc(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = q rij\nfor all i, j. The group \u039b = him ci is then cyclic, of the form hq r i where r is the\ngreatest common divisor of the integers rij . Note that r 6= 0 because r 6= 0.\n(iii) Take \u03bb1 = q r as basis element for \u039b, and let l1 be the corresponding alternating\nbiadditive map on \u0393 as in (2.5), so that c(s, t) = q rl1 (s,t) for s, t \u2208 \u0393. Thus, l1 (\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) =\nrij /r for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\n(iv) Since r 6= 0, we may take \u03bc1 = r. It is most convenient to take a possibly nonquadratic choice for the polynomial f1 in (2.6), namely f1 (z) = z r . It is easily seen\nthat this satisfies the desired conditions:\nf1 (1) = 1,\n\nf1 (q) = \u03bb1 ,\n\nf1\u2032 (1) = \u03bc1 .\n\nDefine c\u0303 as in (2.6), and observe that\nc\u0303(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) = z rl1 (\u01ebi ,\u01ebj ) = z rij\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\n(v) Defining q\u0303ij as in (2.9), we have q\u0303ij (z) = c\u0303(\u01ebi , \u01ebj )2 = z 2rij for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\nConsequently,\nq\u0303ij\u2032 (1) = 2rij\nfor 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n.\nIn view of (4.1), the uniparameter cases of Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.8 can be\nstated as follows:\nTheorem 4.2. Let A = Oq (k n ), assuming that k is an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic zero and q = (q 2rij ), where q \u2208 k \u00d7 is not a root of unity and (rij )\nis a nonzero additively antisymmetric n \u00d7 n matrix over Z.

R. GOODEARL AND E. S. LETZTER\n\n5. Quantum Affine Toric Varieties\nWe extend our main results to quantizations of affine toric varieties and, somewhat\nmore generally, to certain cocycle twists of affine commutative algebras. By a quantum affine toric variety over k we mean, as in [15], an affine domain over k equipped\nwith a rational action of an algebraic torus H by k-algebra automorphisms, such that\nthe H-eigenspaces are 1-dimensional. Since a rational action of H is equivalent to a\ngrading by the character group of H (e.g., [4, Lemma II.2.11]), the quantum affine\ntoric varieties over k are also the affine domains over k, graded by free abelian groups\nof finite rank, with 1-dimensional homogeneous components. This second description\nis convenient for present purposes, as it allows us to define quantizations via cocycle\ntwists. As in [9, Section 6] and [6, Section 4], neither 1-dimensionality of homogeneous components nor absence of zero-divisors is needed in our proofs, and so we can\nwork with a more general class of twists of graded algebras.\n5.1. (i) Let R be a commutative affine k-algebra graded by an abelian group G, and\nlet c : G \u00d7 G \u2192 k \u00d7 be a 2-cocycle. The twist of R by c [1, Section 3] is a G-graded\nk-algebra R\u2032 , with a G-graded vector space isomorphism r 7\u2192 r \u2032 from R \u2192 R\u2032 (the\ntwist map), and multiplication given by r \u2032 s\u2032 = c(\u03b1, \u03b2)(rs)\u2032 for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 G and r \u2208 R\u03b1 ,\ns \u2208 R\u03b2 .\nIn [9, Theorem 6.3], topological quotient maps Spec R \u2192 Spec R\u2032 and max R \u2192\nPrim R\u2032 are constructed, under the assumptions that G is torsionfree and \u22121 \u2208\n/ him ci\n(or char k = 2). As discussed in [6, 4.3], the proof of [9, Theorem 6.3] provides an\nalternating bicharacter d on G such that R\u2032 is isomorphic to the twist of R by d, and\nafter replacing c by d, the torsionfreeness hypothesis on G is no longer needed.\nThus, we now assume that c is an alternating bicharacter on G. Moreover, we\nassume that the subgroup him ci \u2286 k \u00d7 is torsionfree. Set A = R\u2032 , and let \u03a6 : A \u2192 R\nbe the inverse of the twist map.\n(ii) Since R is affine, we can choose a finite set of homogeneous k-algebra generators\nfor R, say r1 , . . . , rn . Set \u03b4i = deg ri for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Define \u0393 and \u0393+ as in (2.2), let\n\u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 G be the group homomorphism such that \u03c1(\u01ebi ) = \u03b4i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and set\n\u0109 = c \u25e6 (\u03c1 \u00d7 \u03c1), which is an alternating bicharacter on \u0393. Also, set q\u0302ij = \u0109(\u01ebi , \u01ebj ) =\nb = (q\u0302ij ).\nc(\u03b4i , \u03b4j ) for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n and q\nn\nb = Oqb (k ) and identify A\nb with k\u0109 \u0393+ , with k-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ }. The\nNow set A\nb = k\u00fb \u0393+ , for\ncorresponding semiclassical limit, as in (2.10), is the Poisson algebra R\na suitable alternating biadditive map \u00fb = \u03c6\u0109 : \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 \u2192 k, where \u03c6 is an injective\nb with\ngroup homomorphism from hq\u0302ij i = him \u0109i to k + , as in (3.4iii). We also write R\nb:A\nb\u2192R\nb such that\nk-basis {xs | s \u2208 \u0393+ }. Hence, there is a k-linear isomorphism \u03a6\ns\ns\n+\nb ) = x for all s \u2208 \u0393 , as in (3.3).\n\u03a6(x\nb \u2192 A and \u03c0R : R\nb \u2192 R be the natural k-algebra quotient maps,\n(iii) Let \u03c0A : A\n\u2032\nsuch that \u03c0A (xi ) = ri and \u03c0R (xi ) = ri for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.

By Theorem 3.6, the rule P 7\u2192 \u03a6\nb \u2212\u2192 Spec A\nb\nPSpec R\n\nb \u2212\u2192 Prim A.\nb\nPPrim R\n\nand\n\nObserve that the first homeomorphism restricts to a homeomorphism \u03b7 : V \u2192 W\nwhere\nb | P \u2287 ker \u03c0R }\nV = {P \u2208 PSpec R\n\nand\n\nb | P \u2287 ker \u03c0A }.\nW = {P \u2208 Spec A\n\nThe quotient maps \u03c0R and \u03c0A induce homeomorphisms \u03c0R\u2217 : PSpec R \u2192 V and\n\u03c0A\u2217 : Spec A \u2192 W , which fit into the following commutative diagram:\nb\nPSpec\nR\nO\n\nb \u22121 (P )\nP 7\u2212\u2192\u03a6\n\nb\nSpec\nA\nO\n/\n\n\u2286\n\n\u2286\n\nVO\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2217\n\u03c0R\n\n/\n\nPSpec R\n\nWO\n\u2217\n\u03c0A\n\nP 7\u2212\u2192\u03a6\u22121 (P )\n\n/\n\nSpec A\n\nThus, we have the desired homeomorphism PSpec R \u2212\u2192 Spec A.\nThat P 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (P ) also determines a homeomorphism PPrim R \u2212\u2192 Prim A follows in the same manner, once one observes that \u03c0R\u2217 and \u03c0A\u2217 map PPrim R and Prim A\nb and W \u2229 Prim A,\nb respectively.\nhomeomorphically onto V \u2229 PPrim R\nThe final homeomorphism will follow from the results above in the same manner\nas Corollary 3.8 once we show that the Zariski topology on PPrim R is the quotient\ntopology induced by the Poisson core map P(\u2212) : Max R \u2192 PPrim R.

As in (3.7iii), it follows from [7, Theorem 4.1(b)] that\nb is the quotient topology from the top map in the diagram.\nthe topology on PPrim R\nIt follows that \u03b8 is a topological quotient map, and therefore so is the bottom map,\nas desired.\n\u0003\n5.3. The uniparameter case of Theorem 5.2 is the case in which c = q d where q \u2208 k \u00d7\nis not a root of unity and d : G \u00d7 G \u2192 k is an antisymmetric biadditive map. We\ncan then take \u03c6 : him ci \u2192 k to be the q-logarithm, so that \u03c6c(\u03b1, \u03b2) = d(\u03b1, \u03b2) for\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 G. The Poisson structure on R is then given by\n{a, b} = d(\u03b1, \u03b2)ab\nfor \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 G and a \u2208 R\u03b1 , b \u2208 R\u03b2 .\nReferences\n[1] M. Artin, W. Schelter, and J.
