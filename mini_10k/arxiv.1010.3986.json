Indeed we expect\nGR to break down as we approach the Planck scale where the quantum theory of gravity\n(whatever it is) will become dominant. In this sense GR is not a full physical theory, only\nan excellent approximation to some (presumably) complicated underlying theory, with the\napproximation getting better and better as the scales we consider are further and further\nfrom the Planck scale1 .\nOver the past century there have been many important theorems proved about the solutions and structure of GR and an important question is whether these theorems are also\nvalid in theories that deviate from GR at some scale. In this paper we will look in particular\nat two theorems, firstly the Lichnerowicz theorem [2], which tells us that the only static,\nasymptotically flat, geodesically complete, vacuum, solution to Einstein's equations is flat\nspace-time. We then consider the Israel theorem [3] which demonstrates that the only static,\nasymptotically flat, vacuum space-time, which contains past and future event horizons (that\nintersect on a surface that is topologically S 2 ) is given by the Schwarzschild metric2 . This\n'no-hair' theorem is a striking result in classical GR and extensions of it to more general\ngravity theories, in particular as we approach the scales on which GR is expected to be\nviolated, would provide us with insight into the transition from GR to full quantum gravity.\nThe action for GR is the well-known Einstein-Hilbert action which is linear in the Ricci\nscalar R (here for simplicity we neglect the cosmological constant). A natural extension of\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\nnelson@gravity.psu.edu\nIt is important to note that here the Planck scale can include both very small (UV) scales and very large\n(IR) scales (see for example[1]).\nThe Israel theorem also shows that the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metric must be the solution if the vacuum is\nreplaced by an electromagnetic field.\n\n\f2\nthis is to include terms of higher powers of curvature invariants to find,\nZ\n\u0001\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\u03b3\n,\nSGrav. = d4 x \u2212g 2 R \u2212 \u03b10 ~Rabcd Rabcd \u2212 \u03b1~Rab Rab + \u03b2~R2 + O R3\n\u03ba\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere we have written only terms that are only 2nd order in the curvature. Through-out\nwe will use Latin indices to label space-time components a, b, * * * = 0, . . . , 3, our signature\nis (\u2212, +, +, +) and our conventions for curvature are Rabcd = \u2202b \u0393dac + . . . and Rab = Rcacb .\nIn Eq. (1.1) the coefficients \u03b10 , \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are dimensionless number and \u03ba2 = 32\u03c0G,\nso GR is recovered simply by setting the coefficients of the higher order terms to zero\n(\u03b10 = \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0) and taking \u03b3 = 2. Also note that the presence of the ~ in Eq. (1.1) is only\ndue to dimensions i.e. this remains a classical theory. If these correction terms are motivated\nfrom some quantum gravity theory, then we may expect the coefficients \u03b10 , \u03b1 and \u03b2 to be\norder unity, however in general they can take any value.\nIn fact, in 4-dimensions, the Gauss-Bonnet combination of second order curvature invariants integrates to a topological invariant, i.e.\nRabcd Rabcd \u2212 4Rab Rab + R2 = total divergence ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhich we can use to eliminate the Rabcd Rabcd term from Eq. (1.1). Thus, up to second order\nin the curvature, the most general correction to GR comes from the action,\nZ\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\u03b3\nSGrav. = d4 x \u2212g 2 R \u2212 \u03b1~Rab Rab + \u03b2~R2 .\n(1.3)\n\u03ba\nThis is the theory that we will work with and in the following we refer to it as 4th order\ngravity, since the equations of motion involve, at most, 4th derivatives of the metric. Historically, theories of this type, with \u03b3 = 0 were considered for many reasons, not least because\nof their improved behaviour under renormalisation, however it was shown that without a\nterm linear in R, the theory (for \u03b1 = 0) does not couple to matter correctly [4]. The\ntheory, with general \u03b3 was first considered in [5] and later in [6], where a perturbative analysis around the Schwarzschild solution was performed, whilst the initial value formulation\nof the theory was given in [7]. The consequence for black holes in higher dimensions has\nbeen consider in [8] and the cosmological implications of 4th order gravity were investigated\nin [9\u201312], with the extension to include (tensor) perturbations appearing only recently [13].\nThe special case in which the correction terms are conformal (when \u03b1 = 3\u03b2, which gives\nthe Bach-Einstein equations) has received considerable attention (see for example [14]) and\nhas recently appeared in the context of non-commutative geometry [15], with much work\ngoing into restricting the parameters of this form of the theory via cosmological and astrophysical observations [16\u201320]. More generally, corrections to GR of this type are expected\nfrom String Theory (see for example [21]), renormalization group techniques [22] and Loop\nQuantum Gravity [23].\nIn addition there has been a great deal of phenomenological work on the cosmological consequences of higher order gravity theories, usually in the form of f (R) theories\n(see for example [24\u201326]). Despite this it is important to note that theories defined by\nEq. (1.3) cannot represent true physical theories for arbitrary coefficients due to the presence of ghosts [6, 27, 28]. Not only are ghost a problem for the quantisation of the theory,\nthey also lead to a break-down of causality at the classical level. Note however that with\n\n\f3\ncertain restrictions on the coefficients (e.g. \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 < 0), all the difficulties associated\nwith these ghosts can be eliminated. Here we will take the (conservative) view that, just as\nfor GR, 4th order gravity should be considered only as an approximation to the underlying,\nfull theory (which is presumable free of ghosts etc.).\nIn this paper we shall demonstrate three key results, the first two: an extension of the\nLichnerowicz (Section (III)) and Israel (Section (IV)) theorems to 4th order gravity (for\nspace-times satisfying some restriction on the magnitude of the spatial curvature) suffice to\ndemonstrate that Schwarzschild is the unique, spherically symmetric, static, asymptotically\nflat, vacuum solution to the theory3 . The final result (Section (V)) considers non-vacuum\nsolutions to the theory and demonstrates that for static, asymptotically flat space-times\nwith matter satisfying certain positivity requirements, it is only the vacuum solutions of GR\nand 4th order gravity that agree; all other solutions of GR fail to be solutions of 4th order\ngravity.\nII.\n\nSTATIC SOLUTIONS OF THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nVarying the action given in Eq.

(2.1), we give it explicitly here.\nTheorem II.1. If the space-time is static (Lt gab = 0) and Da R \u2192 0 sufficiently fast at\ninfinity, then (\u0003 \u2212 m2 ) R = 0, for m 6= 0 \u2208 R implies R = 0. If the space-time is static and\nR \u2192 0 sufficiently fast at infinity the equation \u0003R = 0 implies R = 0.\nProof. We decompose the metric into components parallel and perpendicular to the constant\ntime space-like hyper-surfaces S via gab = hab \u2212 \u03bb1 ta tb , where ta is the time-like Killing field,\nwhich has norm ta ta = \u2212\u03bb and hab is spatial metric on S. Note the following useful identities\nLt R = tb \u2207b R = 0 ,\n\u2207a tb =\n3\n\n1\n(tb \u2207a \u03bb \u2212 ta \u2207b \u03bb) ,\n2\u03bb\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nThis result holds for black-holes in which the spatial curvature outside the horizon is small relative to\nthe scale set between \u03b3\u03ba\u22122 and ~\u03b1. If these corrections come from some quantum gravity theory, this\nrestriction is essentially that the spatial curvature be small compared to the quantum gravity scale.\n\n\f4\nand\nta \u2207a \u03bb = 0 .\n\n(2.5)\n\nUsing these one can readily show that,\n\ng ab \u2207a \u2207b R \u2212 m2 R = D a Da R +\n\n1\n(D a \u03bb) (Da R) \u2212 m2 R = 0 ,\n2\u03bb\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere Da is the spatial covariant derivative compatible with hab . Multiplying this equation\nby \u03bb1/2 R and integrating it over the entire spatial slice, one finds\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221a\n1 \u22121/2\na\n2 1/2 2\n2\n1/2\na\n(2.7)\nR (D \u03bb) (Da R) \u2212 m \u03bb R = 0 .\nhd x \u03bb RD Da R + \u03bb\n2\nS\nIntegrating the first term by parts this becomes,\nZ \u221a\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\nhd3 x D a \u03bb1/2 RDa R \u2212 \u03bb1/2 (D a R) (Da R) \u2212 m2 \u03bb1/2 R2 = 0 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nS\n\nIf the spatial slice is asymptotically constant i.e. Da R \u2192 0 sufficiently fast at infinity, then\nthe boundary term vanishes. The second and third terms in the integrand of Eq. (2.8) are\nmanifestly negative definite and hence each term must vanish at every spatial point. If m 6= 0\nthis implies R = 0, for the case of m = 0 this gives Da R = 0 and hence we additionally\nrequire that R \u2192 0 at infinity in order to find R = 0.\nNote that here we require only that Da R \u2192 0 (or R \u2192 0) sufficiently fast at infinity,\nwhich is satisfied by asymptotically constant (or flat) space-times, but is in general a weaker\ncondition. In the following we will consider asymptotically constant (or flat) space-times\nsince they are of more interest, however all the results hold also for the weaker condition\ngiven above.\nThe basic method of this proof is the following. Decompose the metric onto (and perpendicular to) constant time space-like hyper-surfaces and use this to write the 4-dimensional\ncovariant derivatives as spatial, 3-dimensional covariant derivatives plus correction terms.\nMultiply the resulting equation by a suitable factor and integrate over the space-like hypersurface. Prove that, up to boundary terms, the integrand has a definite sign and hence\nvanishes at each spatial point. This is precisely the same method that we will use to prove\nthat, with some restrictions on the magnitude of the spatial curvature on S, there are no\nstatic, asymptotically constant solutions to the trace-free part of Eq. (2.1), which, using\ntheorem (II.1) can be written as,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b3\n1\ncd\ncd\n~\u03b1 \u0003Rab \u2212\nRab + gab R Rcd \u2212 2R Racbd = 0 ,\n(2.9)\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n2\nfor \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2 \u2265 0. Since Eq. (2.9) is rather more complicated than Eq. (2.2), we proceed by\nfirst proving a series of lemmas 4 .\nLemma II.2. If the space-time is static and asymptotically constant, then (\u0003 \u2212 m2 ) Rab = 0,\nfor m 6= 0 \u2208 R implies Rab = 0.

(2.24) explicitly removes the derivatives of \u03bb from the integrand\nand ensures that \u03bb only appears with positive powers. This will be crucial when we consider\nspace-times with (null) horizons.\nIn any case, asymptotic constancy i.e. Da Rcd \u2192 0 at infinity, ensures that the boundary\nterms in Eq. (2.24) vanish. All the remaining terms are negative definite and hence each\nterm must independently vanish at every spatial point. For m 6= 0 this implies (3) R = 0\nand R\u0304cd = 0, which together with theorem (II.1) and Eq. (2.18) implies Rab = 0. For the\n(3)\nm = 0 case we find that Da R = 0 and Da R\u0304cd = 0 and hence additional require asymptotic\nflatness in order to find Rab = 0.\nThis result is easily extended to include the third term in Eq. (2.9) by using the fact that,\nby Theorem (II.1) we can set R = 0.\nLemma II.3. If the space-time static and asymptotically constant, then the pair of equations\nR = 0 and (\u0003 \u2212 m21 ) Rab + m2 gab Rcd Rcd = 0, for m1 6= 0 \u2208 R and m2 \u2208 R imply Rab = 0,\nwhilst for m1 = 0, additionally requiring the space-time to be asymptotically flat implies\nRab = 0.\nProof. From the equation (\u0003 \u2212 m21 ) Rab + m22 gab Rcd Rcd = 0 it follows that,\n\u0002 1/2 cd a b\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\n\u03bb R\u0304 hc hd + \u03bb\u22121/2 (3) Rta tb\n\u0003 \u2212 m21 Rab + m22 gab Rcd Rcd = 0 .\n\n(2.26)\n\nRecalling that ta ta = \u2212\u03bb and noting that hab R\u0304ab =(3) R we see that Eq. (2.26) reduces to,\n\u0002 1/2 cd a b\n\u0003\n\u0001\n\u03bb R\u0304 hc hd + \u03bb\u22121/2 (3) Rta tb \u0003 \u2212 m21 Rab = 0 ,\n(2.27)\n\nwhich is independent of the value of m2 . By Lemma (II.2), for m1 6= 0, this implies Rab =\n0, provided the space-time is static and asymptotically constant, whilst for m1 = 0 and\nthe space-time being static and asymptotically flat implies Rab = 0. Indeed integrating\nEq. (2.27) over the spatial slice exactly gives Eq. (2.24).\nThe final step that is required in order to allow us to consider Eq. (2.9) is to extend the\nabove Lemmas to include a term of the form Rab Racbd . To do this note that by using the\ndefinition of the Riemann tensor,\n(\u2207a \u2207b \u2212 \u2207b \u2207a ) Rcd = Rabce Red + Rabde Rce ,\n\n(2.28)\n\nand the fact that the contracted Bianchi identity, for R = 0, gives,\n1\n\u2207c Rb c = \u2207b R = 0 ,\n2\n\n(2.29)\n\nRcd Racbd = \u2212\u2207c \u2207a Rb c + Rac Rb c .\n\n(2.30)\n\nwe can write (for R = 0),\n\nThus we see that this term is in fact closely related to \u0003Rab and can be dealt with in a\nsimilar manner.\n\n\f8\nLemma II.4.

In particular, in order to consider space-times with a (static) black-hole, we\n\n\f11\nneed to allow for a null, interior boundary to our space-time i.e. the equal time hyper-surfaces\nbecome null. At first sight the presence of boundary terms in Eq. (3.6) would appear to be a\nsignificant difficulty for such a space-time, however on the horizon, the normal to the spatial\nhyper-surface, na becomes null i.e. na na = \u03bb = 0 and hence the boundary terms vanish.\nThus, if the space-time is asymptotically constant (which ensures the boundary terms at\ninfinity also vanish) and all interior boundaries are null, the result of Section (III) will still\napply.\nTheorem IV.1. Consider a static space-time, in which the spatial curvature everywhere\nsatisfies the following two conditions:\n\u03b3\n,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\u03b3\n,\nR \u2265 \u2212\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\n(3)\n\nR \u2264\n\n(4.1)\n\nLet the space-time be asymptotically constant, unless both of the inequalities in Eq. (4.1)\nare saturated, in which case let the space-time be asymptotically flat. Let the spatial slice be\nbounded by a null surface that is topologically S2 . Then the only solution to 4th order gravity\n(with \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2 \u2265 0), in the region exterior to the null surface, is Rab = 0.\nProof. As in Theorem III.1, the equations of motion for 4th order gravity imply, (Eq. (3.6))\n(\nZ \u221a\nZ \u221a\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nhd3 x (I) =\nhd3 x D a \u03bb1/2 (3) RDa(3) R + R\u0304cd Da R\u0304cd \u2212 R\u0304ef De R\u0304af \u2212(3) RD b R\u0304ba\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212\u03bb1/2 D a R\u0304cd Da R\u0304cd \u2212 2\u03bb1/2 Da R\u0304bc D b R\u0304ac \u2212 \u03bb1/2 D a (3) R \u2212 2D c R\u0304ac Da(3) \u2212 2D b R\u0304ab\n)\nh\ni\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n=0.\n(4.2)\n\u2212\u03bb1/2 R\u0304cd R\u0304cd \u03b3\u03ba\u22122 \u03b1\u22121 + R + (3) R \u03b3\u03ba\u22122 \u03b1\u22121 \u2212(3) R\n\nAt infinity the boundary terms vanish because the spatial section is asymptotically constant, whilst on the interior boundary they vanish because \u03bb = 0. Thus, just as in Theorem (III.1), provided the 3-dimensional curvature satisfies the conditions\n\u03b3\n\u2212(3) R \u2265 0 ,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\u03b3\n+R \u2265 0 ,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\neach term in the integrand of Eq. (4.2) is negative definite and hence vanishes. If either of\nthese inequalities is not saturated everywhere, asymptotic constancy is sufficient to imply\nRab = 0, otherwise asymptotic flatness is required.\nSince 4th order gravity implies Rab = 0 (for asymptotically constant and static spacetimes), provided\n\u03b3\n,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\u03b3\nR \u2265 \u2212\n,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\n(3)\n\nR \u2264\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f12\neven in the presence of null boundaries, it follows that the only spherically symmetric solution\nis the (exterior of the) Schwarzschild metric.\nIt is important to note here that this result relies on the existence of a null boundary to\nthe equal time hyper-surfaces and the existence of a vacuum (Tab = 0) everywhere between\nthis horizon and infinity. This is true for a (static, vacuum) space-time containing an event\nhorizon, however the result cannot be applied to the exterior of a general spherical object that\ndoes not contain such a horizon. In particular this result to does not imply that the metric\noutside a spherically symmetric distribution of matter will be Schwarzschild, unless that\nmatter is entirely contained within the event horizon. This agrees with the (perturbative)\nresults of (for example) [6].\nV.\n\nNON-VACUUM SOLUTIONS\n\nIn Sections (III) and (IV) we showed that for Tab = 0, the static, asymptotically constant\nsolutions of GR are also solutions to 4th order gravity (with \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2 \u2265 0), at least\nin the case of space-times that have a spatial topology of R3 (Theorem (III.1)) or space-times\nthat have internal null boundaries (Theorem (IV.1)), and whose spatial curvature everywhere\nsatisfies Eq. (4.3). A natural question that one may ask is whether this connection between\nthe solutions of GR and 4th order gravity extends to the non-vacuum case i.e. Tab 6= 0. We\nwill now demonstrate that it does not. In fact below we show that for, static, asymptotically\nflat space-times containing a barotropic fluid with equation of state \u03c9 \u2265 \u22123\u22121/3 \u2248 \u22120.6933,\nonly the vacuum solutions of the two theories coincide, with all other solutions being distinct.\nTheorem V.1.

Consider a solution to the Einstein's equations:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u22122\nRab \u2212 gab R = Tab ,\n\u03b3\u03ba\n2\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nthat is static and asymptotically flat. Substituting this into the equations of motion for 4th\norder gravity, Eq. (2.1) we find,\n1\n(\u03b1 \u2212 4\u03b2) gab \u0003R + 2\u03b1Rcd Racbd\n2\n\u0001\n\u03b1Rcd Rcd \u2212 \u03b2R2 = 0 .\n\n(\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2) R;a;b \u2212 \u03b1\u0003Rab \u2212\n\n1\n\u22122\u03b2RRab \u2212 gab\n2\nThe trace of Eq. (5.3) is,\n\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2) \u0003R = 0 .\n\n(5.3)\n\n(5.4)\n\nThen by Theorem (II.1), for \u03b1 \u2212 3\u03b2 6= 0, this implies R = 0. Thus Eq.

(2.19) and Eq. (2.18)) and noting that R = 0. Thus each term in\nthe integrand of Eq. (5.6) is negative definite, and hence vanishes, provided,\nZ \u221a\nhd3 Rab Rbc Rca \u2265 0 .\n(5.9)\nUsing Eq. (5.2) and the fact that R = 0 for these solutions, this condition can be written as\nZ \u221a\nhd3 xT ab T bc T ca \u2265 0 .\n(5.10)\nThus, for matter satisfying Eq. (5.10), a static, asymptotically flat solution to GR is also\na solution to 4th order gravity iff Rab = 0, which, by Theorems (III.1) and (IV.1) corresponds\nto the (static, asymptotically flat) vacuum solutions in both GR and 4th order gravity. Thus,\nother than the vacuum, there are no static, asymptotically flat solutions to GR, with matter\nsatisfying Eq. (5.10), that are also solutions to 4th order gravity.\nIf we consider a perfect fluid the energy momentum tensor can be written as T ab =\n\u03c1u ub + P (\u03b4 ab + ua ub ), with ua a unit time-like vector tangent to the observer's world-line,\nP the fluid's pressure and \u03c1 its energy density. Eq. (5.10) then becomes,\nZ \u221a\n\u0001\nhd3 x \u03c13 + 3P 3 \u2265 0 ,\n(5.11)\na\n\nAssuming the strong energy condition holds, \u03c1 \u2265 0, then this condition is trivial for all\nmatter with positive pressure. If we consider a barotropic fluid with equation of state\n\n\f14\nparameter \u03c9 i.e. P = \u03c9\u03c1 then Eq. (5.10) reduces to,\nZ \u221a\n\u0001\nhd3 x 1 + 3\u03c9 3 \u2265 0 .\n\n(5.12)\n\nThis is, in particular, satisfied for \u03c9 \u2265 \u22123\u22121/3 \u2248 \u22120.6933 everywhere, and hence for dust\n(\u03c9 = 0) and radiation (\u03c9 = 1/3) fluids.\nThus for a static, asymptotically flat, space-time containing a single, barotropic fluid for\nwhich \u03c9 \u2265 \u22123\u22121/3 everywhere, no solutions to GR remain (static and asymptotically flat)\nsolutions to 4th order gravity.\nOne can also consider, for example, the energy-momentum tensor of a Maxwell field,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 a d e\na\na c\nTb=\nF cF b \u2212 g bF eF d ,\n(5.13)\n4\u03c0\n4\nwith Fab the electromagnetic field tensor. For such a field, one can directly check that\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n3\n1\n1\n2 3\n4\n2\n6\na b c\n(5.14)\nTrF \u2212\nTrF TrF \u2212 TrF \u2265 0 ,\nT bT cT a =\n64\u03c0 3 8\n4\n\nwhere the matrix F is given by F ab and hence is anti-symmetric and the final inequality\nfollows from direct computation, for a general anti-symmetric matrix.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the Sections (III) and (IV) we demonstrated that there are no, non-trivial, static,\nasymptotically constant solutions to 4th order gravity, provided the 3-dimensional curvature\nsatisfies the following two conditions:\n(3)\n\nR\u2264\n\n\u03b3\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\nand\n\nR\u2265\u2212\n\n\u03b3\n,\n~\u03b1\u03ba2\n\n(6.1)\n\neverywhere outside a null horizon. The meaning of these conditions is the following. We\nrequire that the 3-dimensional scalar curvature, measured by both (3) R and R, to be everywhere smaller in magnitude than the scale set by the ratio between \u03b3\u03ba\u22122 and ~\u03b1. This\nis exactly the scale at which corrections to General Relativity will become significant. If\nthese corrections are motivated by quantum corrections to general relativity then this will\nbe the quantum gravity scale. Thus our results can interpreted as follows: there are no,\nnon-trivial, static, asymptotically constant, vacuum solutions to 4th order gravity, so long\nas the 3-dimensional scalar curvature is everywhere less than the quantum gravity scale. In\nparticular for black holes, this implies that the Schwarzschild solution is the unique, spherically symmetric, static, asymptotically constant vacuum solution to 4th order gravity, unless\nthe 3-dimensional scalar curvature exceeds the quantum gravity scale outside the horizon, a\ncondition that is easily achieved for macroscopic black-holes.\nThis also demonstrates the fact that the 'no-hair' theorem applies to 4th order gravity\nprovided that the spatial curvature (outside the horizon) is everywhere less than the quantum\ngravity scale. Note however that the converse does not follow i.e. if the spatial curvature\noutside the horizon is greater than the quantum gravity scale, Theorem (IV.1) does not\n\n\f15\nimply that there are additional (static, asymptotically flat) solutions.\nFinally, in Section (V), we demonstrated that for matter satisfying the rather mild condition,\nZ \u221a\nhd3 xT ab T bc T ca \u2265 0 ,\n(6.2)\n\nexcept for the vacuum, none of the static, asymptotically flat solutions to GR are solutions to\n4th order gravity. In particular this includes space-times containing single, barotropic fluids\nwith equations of state everywhere satisfying, \u03c9 \u2265 \u22123\u22121/3 , such as relativistic and nonrelativistic Baryons and Fermions. A specific application of this is that the GR solutions\nfor (static, asymptotically flat) stars will fail to be solutions in 4th order gravity (for the\nsame matter distribution). This agrees with the results of [6], which gives the solutions\nto 4th order gravity for a particular, extended, spherically symmetric, system (calculated\nperturbatively and close to the origin) which is shown not to be Schwarzschild.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Abhay Ashtekar for extremely helpful discussions and for suggesting the topic.

(6.16) gives,\n1 ab\nh (\u2207a \u03bb) (\u2207b Rcd )\n2\u03bb\n\u0001\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n+ 3 tc ta (\u2207b \u03bb) \u2207b \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb (\u2207c \u03bb) (\u2207a \u03bb) Rad\n4\u03bb\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n1\n\u2212 2 [ta (\u2207d \u03bb) \u2212 td (\u2207a \u03bb)] tb (\u2207c \u03bb) \u2212 tc \u2207d \u03bb Rba\n2\u03bb\n\u0001\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n+ 3 ta td (\u2207b \u03bb) \u2207b \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb (\u2207a \u03bb) (\u2207d \u03bb) Rca \u2212 m2 Rcd = 0 ,\n4\u03bb\nhab \u2207a heb \u2207e Rcd +\n\nwhich is Eq. (2.16).\nFinally, we need to show that the terms given in Eq. (3.8) are positive i.e. that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nDa R\u0304bc D a R\u0304bc + 2 Da R\u0304bc D b R\u0304ac \u2265 0 .\n\n(6.20)\n\n(6.21)\n\nTo do this, consider an arbitary tensor Tabc that is symmetric in the final two indices i.e.\nTabc = Tacb . Now we use a tetrad basis, eia , that is othonormal i.e. eia eaj = \u03b4ji , to decompose\nthe (positive definite) metric as,\nhab = eia ejb \u03b4ij .\n(6.22)\nWith this one can write,\nT abc Tabc = had hde hcf Tabc Tdef = Tijk Tmnp \u03b4 im \u03b4 jn \u03b4 kp ,\nT abc Tbac = hae hbd hcf Tabc Tdef = Tijk Tmnp \u03b4 in \u03b4 jm \u03b4 kp .\n\n(6.23)\n\n\f18\nWe now form the combination,\nT abc Tabc + 2T abc Tbac ,\n\n(6.24)\n\nand expand out the Einstein summations. Since Tabc is a three index tensor, the three\npossibilities we need to consider are: the indices are the same, one is distinct and all are\ndistinct. The first possibility clearly involves only positive terms. In the orthonormal tetrad\nbasis given by Eq. (6.22) these are\nT abc Tabc + 2T abc Tbac = 3 (T111 T111 + T222 T222 + T333 T333 ) + . . . ,\n\n(6.25)\n\nwhere the dots remind us that there are other terms we need to account for. The terms in\nEq. (6.24) that arise from one index being distinct, with the other two being the same, can,\nby using Eq. (6.22), be grouped to give,\nX\nT abc Tabc + 2T abc Tbac =\n(2Tiij + Tijj ) (2Tiij + Tijj ) + . . . ,\n(6.26)\ni6=j\n\nwhere there is no implicit summation over repeated indices and again the dots indicate that\nthere we are considering only certain terms. Finally we need to account for the terms in\nEq. (6.24) for which all the indices are distinct, which are given by,\nX\n2 (Tijk + Tjik + Tkij ) (Tijk + Tjik + Tkij ) + . . . ,\n(6.27)\nT abc Tabc + 2T abc Tbac =\ni6=j6=k\n\nwhere again there is no implicit summation over repeated indices and the dots indicate that\nthere are additional terms. In Eq. (6.26) and Eq. (6.27), crucial use has been made of the\nfact that Tijk = Tikj . Finally, putting these together we find that, in this orthonormal tetrad\nbasis,\nX\nX\nT abc Tabc + 2T abc Tbac = 3\nTiii Tiii +\n(2Tiij + Tijj ) (2Tiij + Tijj )\ni\n\n+\n\nX\n\ni6=j\n\n2 (Tijk + Tjik + Tkij ) (Tijk + Tjik + Tkij ) ,\n\n(6.28)\n\ni6=j6=k\n\nwhere once again there is no implicit summation over repeated indices. Clearly each term\nin Eq. (6.28) is positive. It is worth noting here that this result hold in any number of\ndimensions, provided the metric, hab , is positive definite.\nOne may be concerned by the fact that if Tabc were also anti-symmetric in the first\ntwo indices, the combination given on the left-hand-side of Eq. (6.28), would appear to be\nnegative. However there are no three index tensors that are anti-symmetric in the first pair\nof indices and symmetric in the second pair, as can easily be checked,\nTabc = \u2212Tbac = \u2212Tbca = Tcba = Tcab = \u2212Tacb = \u2212Tabc .\n\n(6.29)\n\nEq. (6.28) holds for any three index tensor that is symmetric in its final pair of indices\nand in particular it holds for Tabc = Da R\u0304bc , thus,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nDa R\u0304bc D a R\u0304bc + 2 Da R\u0304bc D b R\u0304ac \u2265 0 ,\n(6.30)\n\n\f19\nas required.\n\n[1] A.
