Moreover, Nulsen et al. [3] and Wise et al. [4] detected a large-scale (\u223c 400 kpc)\nsurface brightness discontiunuity encircling the largest pair of cavities (Fig. 1, left\npanel). These authors interpreted the surface discontinuity as a shock caused by the same\nAGN outbreak that created the largest pair of X-ray cavities. However, the temperature\njump that should be associated with such a shock was not yet detected.\n\nObservations\nWe analyzed a new deep XMM-Newton observation of Hydra A, focusing on the\nlarge-scale shock described above (Simionescu et al. 6). The shock front can be seen,\nboth, in the pressure map and in temperature profiles (Fig. 1, right panel). Thus, we can\nconfirm the shock nature of the surface brightness discontinuity. The Mach number of\nthe shock inferred in several sectors is \u223c 1.3. The shape of the shock can be approximated with an ellipse centered \u223c 70 kpc towards the NE from the cluster center. In\naddition to this offset, the northern radio lobes appear larger than the southern ones.\n\n\fA. Simionescu et al.: The large-scale shock in the cluster of galaxies Hydra A\n\n725\n\nTable 1.

Cold front in a Virgo-like cluster: slice through the computational grid, color-coding shows\ntemperature (left) and unnormalised metal fraction (right).\n\nobviously merging clusters, another, somewhat weaker, variety has been detected to be\n\"wrapped\" around the cores of many otherwise relaxed and cool core clusters (Ghizzardi et al. 8, 9). The best-fit scenario available so far to explain these cold fronts is the\nidea of ICM sloshing, where a subcluster or, in best case, a dark matter only substructure passes near the cluster core, offsets the ICM, which then sloshes inside the cluster\npotential (Markevitch et al. 10, Ascasibar and Markevitch 11). Recently, also discontinuities in metalicity associated with such cold fronts have been observed (e.g. Fabian\net al. 12, Dupke et al. 13), providing additional constraints on models.\nWe have run high resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the sloshing scenario\n(Roediger et al. in prep.) which also trace the metal distribution in the ICM. These\nsimulations can produce both, temperature and metalicity discontinuities (Fig. 3). We\n\n\fFIGURE 4.

For this purpose, we model ICM sloshing in both, spherical and elliptical clusters,\nand study the influence of cluster shape on the structure of the cold fronts.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the support of the Priority Programme \"Witnesses of Cosmic History\"\nof the DFG (German Research Foundation) and the supercomputing grant NIC 2195 at\nthe John-Neumann Institut at the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich.
