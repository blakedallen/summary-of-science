We\napproach this problem by establishing the equivalence with the problem\nof the maximum monotone path in an arrangement of n lines. A related\nproblem on convex pseudo-discs is also discussed in the paper.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet P be a set of n points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. A\nsubset of P is called linearly separable if it is the intersection of P with a\nclosed half-plane. A k-set of P is a subset of k points from P which is linearly\nseparable. Let Ak = Ak (P ) denote the collection of all k-sets of P . It is a wellknown open problem to determine f (k), the maximum possible cardinality of\nAk , where P varies over all possible sets of n points in general position in\nthe plane. The \u221acurrent records are f (k) = O(nk 1/3 ) by Dey ([D98]) and\nf (\u230an/2\u230b) \u2265 ne\u03a9( log n) by T\u00f3th ([T01]).\nLet A = A(P ) = \u222ank=0 Ak be the family of all linearly separable subsets\nof P . The family A is partially ordered by inclusion. Clearly, each Ak is an\nanti-chain in A. The following problem was raised by Walter Morris in 2003\nin relation with the convex dimension of a point set (see [ES88]) and, as it\nturns out, it was independently raised by Alon Efrat 10 years before, in 1993:\nProblem 1. What is the maximum possible cardinality g(n) of an anti-chain\nin the poset A, over all sets P with n points?\n1\n\nThis research was supported by a Grant from the G.I.F., the German-Israeli Foundation\nfor Scientific Research and Development.\n\u2217\nMathematics Dept., Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.\nroom@math.technion.ac.il.\n\u2020\nInstitut f\u00fcr Informatik, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Takustr. 9, 14195 Berlin, Germany.\nrote@inf.fu-berlin.de\n\n1\n\n\fIn Section 2 we show that in fact g(n) can be very large, and in particular\nmuch larger than f (n).\nTheorem 1. g(n) = \u03a9(n\n\nd\n2\u2212 \u221alog\nn\n\n), for some absolute constant d > 0.\n\nIn an attempt to bound from above the function g(n) one can view linearly\nseparable sets as a special case of a slightly more general concept:\nDefinition 1. Let P be a set of n points in general position in the plane.\nA Family F of subsets of P is called a family of convex pseudo-discs if the\nfollowing two conditions are satisfied:\n1. Every set in F is the intersection of P with a convex set.\n2. If A and B are two different sets in F , then both sets conv(A) \\ conv(B)\nand conv(B) \\ conv(A) are connected (or empty).\nOne natural example for a family of convex pseudo-discs is the family\nA(P ), where P is a set of n points in general position in the plane. To\nsee this, observe that every linearly separable set is the intersection of P\nwith a convex set, namely, a half-plane. It is therefore left to verify that\nif A = P \u2229 HA and B = P \u2229 HB , where HA and HB are two half-planes,\nthen both conv(A) \\ conv(B) and conv(B) \\ conv(A) are connected. Let A\u2032 =\nA \\ HB = A \\ B = A \\ conv(B). Since conv(A\u2032 ) \u2229 conv(B) = \u2205, we have\nconv(A) \\ conv(B) \u2283 conv(A\u2032 ). For any x \u2208 conv(A) \\ conv(B), we claim that\nthere is a point a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 such that the line segment [x, a\u2032 ] is fully contained in\nconv(A)\\conv(B). This will clearly show that conv(A)\\conv(B) is connected.\nLet a1 , a2 , a3 be three points in A such that x is contained in the triangle\na1 a2 a3 . If each line segment [x, ai ], for i = 1, 2, 3, contains a point of conv(B),\nit follows that x \u2208 conv(B), contrary to our assumption. Thus there must be\na line segment [x, ai ] that is contained in A\u2032 = A \\ conv(B), and we are done.\nIn Section 3 we bound from above the maximum size of a family of convex\npseudo-discs of a set P of n points in the plane, assuming that this family of\nsubsets of P is by itself an anti-chain with respect to inclusion:\nTheorem 2. Let F be a family of convex pseudo-discs of a set P of n points\nin general position in the plane.\n\u0001 If no member of F is contained in another,\nn\nthen F consists of at most 4 2 + 1 members.\n\nClearly, in view of Theorem 1, the result in Theorem 2 is nearly best\npossible. We show by a simple construction that Theorem 2 is in fact tight,\napart from the constant multiplicative factor of n2 .\n\n2\n\nLarge anti-chains of linearly separable sets\n\nInstead of considering Problem 1 directly, we will consider a related problem.\n2\n\n\fDefinition 2. For a pair x, y of points and a pair l1 , l2 of non-vertical lines,\nwe say that x, y strongly separate l1 , l2 if x lies strictly above l1 and strictly\nbelow l2 , and y lies strictly above l2 and strictly below l1 .\nWe will also take the dual viewpoint and say that l1 , l2 strongly separate\nx, y. (In fact, this relation is invariant under the standard point-line duality.)\nIf we have a set L of lines, we say that the point pair x, y is strongly\nseparated by L, if L contains two lines l1 , l2 that strongly separate x, y.\nA pair of lines l1 , l2 is said to be strongly separated by a set P of points\nif there are two points x, y \u2208 P that strongly separate l1 and l2 .\nUsing the above terminology one can reduce Problem 1 to the following\nproblem:\nProblem 2. Let P be a set of n points in the plane. What is the maximum\npossible cardinality h(n) (taken over all possible sets P of n points) of a set\nof lines L in the plane such that for every two lines l1 , l2 \u2208 L, P strongly\nseparates l1 and l2 .\n\nFigure 1: Problem 2.\nTo see the equivalence of Problem 1 and Problem 2, let P be a set of n\npoints and L be a set of h(n) lines that answer Problem 2. We can assume\nthat none of the points lie on a line of L. Then with each of the lines l \u2208 L\nwe associate the subset of P which is the intersection of P with the half-plane\nbelow l. We thus obtain h(n) subsets of P each of which is a linearly separable\nsubset of P . Because of the condition on L and P , none of these linearly\nseparable sets may contain another. Therefore we obtain h(n) elements from\nA(P ) that form an anti-chain, hence g(n) \u2265 h(n).\nConversely, assume we have an anti-chain of size g(n) in A(P ) for a set P of\nn points. Each linearly separable set is the intersection of P with a half-plane,\n3\n\n\fwhich is bounded by some line l. We can assume without loss of generality\nthat none of these lines is vertical, and at least half of the half-spaces lie below\ntheir bounding lines. These lines form a set L of at least \u2308g(n)/2\u2309 lines, and\neach pair of lines is separated by two points from the n-point set P . Thus,\nh(n) \u2265 \u2308g(n)/2\u2309.\nBefore reducing Problem 2 to another problem, we need the following\nsimple lemma.\nLemma 1. Let l1 , . . . , ln be n non-vertical lines arranged in increasing order\nof slopes. Let P be a set of points. Assume that for every 1 \u2264 i < n, P\nstrongly separates li and li+1 . Then for every 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, P strongly\nseparates li and lj .\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on j \u2212 i. For j = i + 1 there is\nnothing to prove. Assume j \u2212 i \u2265 2. We first show the existence of a point\nx \u2208 P that lies above li and below lj . Let B denote the intersection point of\nli and lj . Let ri denote the ray whose apex is B, included in li , and points\nto the right. Similarly, let rj denote the ray whose apex is B, included in lj ,\nand points to the right.\nSince the slope of li+1 is between the slope of li and the slope of lj , li+1\nmust intersect either ri or rj (or both, in case it goes through B).\nCase 1. li+1 intersects ri . Then there is a point x \u2208 P that lies above li and\nbelow li+1 . This point x must also lie below lj .\nCase 2. li+1 intersects rj . Then, by the induction hypothesis, there is a point\nx \u2208 P that lies above li+1 and below lj . This point x must also lie above li .\nThe existence of a point y that lies above lj and below li is symmetric.\nBy Lemma 1, Problem 2 is equivalent to following problem.\nProblem 3. What is the maximum cardinality h(n) of a collection of lines\nL = {l1 , . . . , lh(n) } in the plane, indexed so that the slope of li is smaller than\nthe slope of lj whenever i < j, such that there exists a set P of n points that\nstrongly separates li and li+1 , for every 1 \u2264 i < h(n)?\nWe will consider the dual problem of Problem 3:\nProblem 4. What is the maximum cardinality h(n) of a set of points P =\n{p1 , . . . , ph(n) } in the plane, indexed so that the x-coordinate of pi is smaller\nthan the x-coordinate of pj , whenever i < j, such that there exists a set L of\nn lines that strongly separates pi+1 and pi , for every 1 \u2264 i < h(n)?\nWe will relate Problem 4 to another well-known problem: the question of\nthe longest monotone path in an arrangement of lines.\nConsider an x-monotone path in a line arrangement in the plane. The\nlength of such a path is the number of different line segments that constitute\nthe path, assuming that consecutive line segments on the path belong to\ndifferent lines in the arrangement. (In other words, if the path passes through\na vertex of the arrangement without making a turn, this does not count as a\nnew edge.)\n4\n\n\fProblem 5. What is the maximum possible length \u03bb(n) of an x-monotone\npath in an arrangement of n lines?\nA construction of [BRSSS04] gives a simple line arrangement in the plane\nwhich consists of n lines and which contains an x-monotone path of length\n2\u2212 \u221a\n\nd\n\nlog n ) for some absolute constant d > 0.\n\u03a9(n\nNo upper bound that is\nasymptotically better than the trivial bound of O(n2 ) is known.\nProblem 5 is closely related to Problem 4, and hence also to the other\nproblems:\n\nProposition 1.\n\u0018\n\n\u0019\n\u03bb(n) + 1\nh(n) \u2265\n,\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bb(n) \u2265 h(n) \u2212 2\n\n(2)\n\nProof. We first prove h(n) \u2265 \u2308(\u03bb(n) + 1)/2\u2309. Let L be a simple arrangement\nof n lines that admits an x-monotone path of length m = \u03bb(n). Denote by\nx0 , x1 , . . . , xm the vertices of a monotone path arranged in increasing order of\nx-coordinates. In this notation x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 are vertices of the line arrangement L, while x0 and xm are chosen arbitrarily on the corresponding two rays\nwhich constitute the first and last edges, respectively, of the path. For each\n1 \u2264 i < m let si denote the line that contains the segment xi\u22121 xi , and let ri\ndenote the line through the segment xi xi+1 .\nFor 1 \u2264 i < m, we say that the path bends downward at the vertex xi\nif the slope of si is greater than the slope of ri , and it bends upward if the\nslope of si is smaller than the slope of ri . Without loss of generality we may\nassume that at least half of the vertices x1 , . . . , xm\u22121 of the monotone path\nare downward bends.\n\np2\n\np1\n\nxi4\n\nxi2\nxi3\nxi1\np0\n\nxik\npk\n\np3\n\nFigure 2: Constructing a solution for Problem 4.\n\n5\n\n\fLet i1 < i2 < * * * < ik be all indices such that xij is a downward bend,\nwhere k \u2265 (m \u2212 1)/2. Observe that for every 1 \u2264 j < k, the monotone path\nbetween xij and xij+1 is an upward-bending convex polygonal path.\nWe will now define k + 1 points p0 , p1 , . . . , pk such that for every 0 \u2264 j < k\nthe x-coordinate of pj is smaller than the x-coordinate of pj+1 , and the line\nrij lies above pj and below pj+1 while the line sij lies below pj and above\npj+1 . This construction will thus show that h(n) \u2265 \u2308 \u03bb(n)+1\n\u2309.\n2\nFor every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k let Uj and Wj denote the left and respectively the\nright wedges delimited by rij and sij . That is, Uj is the set of all points that\nlie below rij and above sij . Similarly, Wj is the set of all points that lie above\nrij and below sij .\nClaim 1. For every 1 \u2264 j < k, Wj and Uj+1 have a nonempty intersection.\nProof. We consider two possible cases:\nCase 1. ij+1 = ij + 1. In this case rij = sij+1 . Therefore any point above the\nline segment [xij xij+1 ] that is close enough to that segment lies both below\nsij and below rij+1 and hence Wj \u2229 Uj+1 6= \u2205.\nCase 2. ij+1 \u2212 ij > 1. In this case, as we observed earlier, the monotone\npath between xij and xij+1 is a convex polygonal path. Therefore, rij and\nsij+1 are different lines that meet at a point B whose x-coordinate is between\nthe x-coordinates of xij and xij+1 . Any point that lies vertically above B and\nclose enough to B belongs to both Wj and Uj+1 .\nNow it is very easy to construct p0 , p1 , . . . , pk , see Figure 2. Simply take\np0 to be any point in U1 , and for every 1 \u2264 j < k let pj be any point in\nWj \u2229 Uj+1 . Finally, let pk be any point in Wk . It follows from the definition\nof U1 , . . . , Uk and W1 , . . . , Wk that for every 0 \u2264 j < k, rij+1 lies above pj and\nbelow pj+1 and the line sij+1 lies below pj and above pj+1 .\nWe now prove the opposite direction: \u03bb(n) \u2265 h(n) \u2212 2.\nAssume we are given h(n) points p1 , . . . , ph(n) sorted by x-coordinate and\na set of n lines L such that every pair pi , pi+1 is strongly separated by L.\nBy perturbing the lines if necessary, we can assume that none of the lines\ngoes through a point, and no three lines are concurrent. For 1 < i < h(n),\nlet fi be the face of the arrangement that contains pi , and let Ai and Bi be,\nrespectively, the left-most and right-most vertex in this face. (The faces fi\nare bounded, and therefore Ai and Bi are well-defined.) The monotone path\nwill follow the upper boundary of each face fi from Ai to Bi .\nWe have to show that we can connect Bi to Ai+1 by a monotone path.\nThis follows from the separation property of L. Let si , ri be a pair of lines\nthat strongly separates pi and pi+1 in such a way that ri lies above pi and\nbelow pi+1 and si lies below pi and above pi+1 . Since Bi lies on the boundary\nof the face fi that contains pi , Bi lies also between ri and si , including the\npossibility of lying on these lines. We can thus walk on the arrangement from\nBi to the right until we hit ri or si , and from there we proceed straight to the\nintersection point Qi of ri and si . Similarly, there is a path in the arrangement\n6\n\n\ffrom Ai+1 to the left that reaches Qi . and these two paths together link Bi\nwith Ai+1 .\nTo count the number of edges of this path, we claim that there must be at\nleast one bend between Bi and Ai+1 (including the boundary points Bi and\nAi+1 ). If there is no bend at Qi , the path must go straight through Qi , say,\non ri . But then the path must leave ri at some point when going to the right:\nif the path has not left ri by the time it reaches Ai+1 and Ai+1 lies on ri ,\nthen the path must bend upward at this point, since it proceeds on the upper\nboundary of the face fi+1 that lies above ri .\nThus, the path makes at least h(n) \u2212 3 bends (between Bi and Ai+1 , for\n1 < i < h(n) \u2212 1) and contains at least h(n) \u2212 2 edges.\nNow it is very easy to give a lower bound for g(n), and prove Theorem 1.\n2\u2212 \u221a\n\nd\n\nlog n ),\n\u2309 = \u03a9(n\nIndeed, this follows because g(n) \u2265 h(n) and h(n) \u2265 \u2308 \u03bb(n)+1\n2\nThe close relation between Problems 1 and 5 comes probably as no big\nsurprise if one considers the close connection between k-sets and levels in\narrangements of lines (see [E87, Section 3.2]). For a given set of n points\nP , the k-sets are in one-to-one correspondence with the faces of the dual\narrangements of lines which have k lines passing below them and n \u2212 k lines\npassing above them (or vice versa). The lower boundaries of these cells form\nthe k-th level in the arrangement, and the upper boundaries form the (k+1)-st\nlevel.\nOur chain of equivalence from Problem 1 to Problem 5 extends this relation\nbetween k-sets and levels in a way that is not entirely trivial: for example, establishing that we get sets that form an antichain requires some work, whereas\nfor k-sets this property is fulfilled automatically.\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 2\n\nThe heart of our argument uses a linear algebra approach first applied by\nTverberg [T82] in his elegant proof for a theorem of Graham and Pollak [GP72]\non decomposition of the complete graph into bipartite graphs.\nLet F be a collection of convex pseudo-discs of a set P of n points in\ngeneral position in the plane. We wish to bound from above the size of F\n\u2192\nassuming that no set in F contains another. For every directed line L = \u2212\nxy\npassing through two points x and y in P we denote by Lx the collection of\nall sets A \u2208 F that lie in the closed half-plane to the left of L such that L\ntouches conv(A) at the point x only. Similarly, let Ly be the collection of all\nsets A \u2208 F that lie in the closed half-plane to the left of L such that L touches\nconv(A) at the point y only. Finally, let Lxy be those sets A \u2208 F that lie in\nthe closed half-plane to the left of L such that L supports conv(A) at the edge\nxy.\nDefinition 3. Let A and B be two sets in F . Let L be a directed line through\ntwo points x and y in P . We say that L is a common tangent of the first kind\n7\n\n\fB\nA\n\nB\n\nL\n\nA\n\nL\n\nL\n\nFigure 3: The two cases of common tangents in Lemma 2\nwith respect the pair (A, B) if A \u2208 Lx and B \u2208 Ly .\nWe say that L is a common tangent of the second kind with respect to\n(A, B) if A \u2208 Lxy and B \u2208 Ly , or if A \u2208 Lx and B \u2208 Lxy .\nThe crucial observation about any two sets A and B in F is stated in the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 2. Let A and B be two sets in F . Then exactly one of the following\nconditions is true.\n1. There is precisely one common tangent of the first kind with respect to\n(A, B) and no common tangent of the second kind with respect to (A, B),\nor\n2. there is no common tangent of the first kind with respect to (A, B), and\nthere are precisely two common tangents of the second kind with respect\n(A, B).\nProof. The idea is that because A and B are two pseudo-discs and none of\nconv(A) and conv(B) contains the other, then as we roll a tangent around\nC = conv(A \u222a B), there is precisely one transition between A and B, and this\nis where the situation described in the lemma occurs (see Figure 3).\nFormally, by our assumption on F , none of A and B contains the other.\nAny directed line L that is a common tangent of the first or second kind with\nrespect to A and B must be a line supporting conv(A \u222a B) at an edge.\nLet x0 , . . . , xk\u22121 denote the vertices of C = conv(A \u222a B) arranged in counterclockwise order on the boundary of C. In what follows, arithmetic on\nindices is done modulo k.\nThere must be an index i such that xi \u2208 A \\ B, for otherwise every xi\nbelongs to B and therefore conv(B) = conv(A \u222a B) \u2283 conv(A) and therefore\nB \u2283 A (because both A and B are intersections of P with convex sets) in\ncontrast to our assumption. Similarly, there must be an index i such that\nxi \u2208 B \\ A.\n8\n\n\fLet IA be the set of all indices i such that xi \u2208 A \\ B, and let IB be the\nset of all indices i such that xi \u2208 B \\ A.\nWe claim that IA (and similarly IB ) is a set of consecutive indices. To\nsee this, assume to the contrary that there are indices i, j, i\u2032 , j \u2032 arranged in a\ncyclic order modulo k such that xi , xi\u2032 \u2208 A \\ B and xj , xj \u2032 \u2208 B. Then it is\neasy to see that conv(A) \\ conv(B) is not a connected set because xi and xi\u2032\nare in different connected components of this set.\nWe have therefore two disjoint intervals IA = {iA , iA + 1, . . . , jA } and\nIB = {iB , iB + 1, . . . , jB }. It is possible that iA = jA or iB = jB .\nObserve that xiA , xjA , xiB , xjB are arranged in this counterclockwise cyclic\norder on the boundary of C, and for every index i \u2208\n/ IA \u222a IB , xi \u2208 A \u2229 B.\nThe only candidates for common tangents of the first kind or of the second\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nkind with respect to A and B are of the form \u2212\nx\u2212\ni xi+1 , that is, they must pass\nthrough two consecutive vertices of C.\nWe distinguish two possible cases:\n1. iB = jA + 1. In this case the line through xjA and xiB is the only\ncommon tangent of the first kind with respect to (A, B) and there are\nno common tangents of the second kind with respect to (A, B).\n2. iB 6= jA + 1. In this case, there is no common tangent of the first kind\nwith respect to (A, B). The line through xiB \u22121 and xiB and the line\nthrough xjA and xjA +1 are the only common tangents of the second\nkind with respect to (A, B).\nThis completes the proof of the lemma.\nLet A1 , . . . , Am be all the sets in F , and for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m let zi be an\n\u2192 define the\nindeterminate associated with Ai . For each directed line L = \u2212\nxy,\nfollowing polynomial PL :\nPL (z1 , . . . , zm ) =\n\u0013 \u0012 X \u0013\u0012 X\n\u0012 X \u0013\u0012 X\n\u0013 \u0012 X \u0013\u0012 X\n\u0013\n1\n1\nzj +\nzi\nzj +\nzj\nzi\nzi\n2\n2\nAi \u2208Lx\n\nAj \u2208Ly\n\nAi \u2208Lx\n\nAj \u2208Lxy\n\nAi \u2208Ly\n\nAj \u2208Lxy\n\nThis polynomial contains a term zu zv whenever L is a tangent line for the\npair (Au , Av ) or for the pair (Av , Au ) (of the first or of the second kind, and\nwith coefficient 1 or 12 , accordingly). If we sum this equation over all directed\nlines L, it follows by Lemma 2 that every term zu zv with u 6= v appears with\ncoefficient 2:\nX\nX\n2\nPL (z1 , . . . , zm ) =\n2zu zv = (z1 + * * * + zm )2 \u2212 (z12 + * * * + zm\n) (3)\nL\n\nu<v\n\nP\nP\nConsider the system of linear equations Ai \u2208Lx zi = 0 and Ai \u2208Ly zi = 0,\n\u2192 varies over all directed lines determined by P . Add to this\nwhere L = \u2212\nxy\n9\n\n\f\u0001\nsystem the equation z\u00011 + * * * + zm = 0. There are 4 n2 + 1 equations in this\nsystem and if m > 4 n2 + 1, there must be a nontrivial solution. However, it is\neasily seen that a nontrivial solution (z1 , . . . , zm ) will result in a contradiction\nto (3). This is because the left-hand side of (3) vanishes, while the right-hand\n\u0001\n2 ) 6= 0. We conclude that |F | = m \u2264 4 n + 1.\nside equals \u2212(z12 + * * * + zm\n2\n\nWe now show by a simple construction that Theorem 2 is tight apart\nfrom the multiplicative constant factor of n2 . Fix three rays r1 , r2 , and r3\nemanating from the origin such that the angle between two rays is 120 degrees.\nFor each i = 1, 2, 3, let pi1 , . . . , pin be n points on ri , indexed according to their\nincreasing distance from the origin. Slightly perturb the points to get a set P\nof 3n points in general position in the plane. For every 1 \u2264 j, k, l \u2264 n define\nFjkl = {p11 , . . . , p1j } \u222a {p21 , . . . , p2k } \u222a {p31 , . . . , p3l }.\nIt can easily be checked that the collection of all Fjkl such that 1 \u2264 j, k, l \u2264 n\nand j + k + l = n + 2 is\u0001 an anti-chain of convex pseudo-discs of P . This\ncollection consists of n+1\nsets.\n2\n\nReferences\n[BRSSS04] J. Balogh, O. Regev, C. Smyth, W. Steiger, and M. Szegedy, Long\nmonotone paths in line arrangements. Discrete Comput.
