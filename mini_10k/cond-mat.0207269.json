Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that above a definite size of the studied systems the value of the integral defining the friction coefficient goes to a quasi\nconstant value (a plateau) when the upper bound on time increases. The\nminimal value of the system size where the integral exhibits this asymptotic\nbehavior, rises with the Brownian particle size. From the plateau, a reliable\nestimate of the friction coefficient is obtained.\n\nPACS numbers: 83.10.Mj, 83.10.Rs\n\nIn solutions, it is supposed that the large particles such as micelles or colloids which\ncoexist with the atoms, ions or small molecules of the solvent behave as Brownian particles. At low concentrations of the large particles, by using multi-scale analysis [1\u20134], this\nhypothesis has been justified in the limit where the ratio between the mass of the solvated\nparticles and that of the solvent molecules goes to \u221e. It has then been established that the\ndiffusion coefficient of Brownian particles can be computed in term of the friction coefficient\ncharacterizing the force exerted on them by the solvent. When the Brownian particles have\n1\n\n\fa quasi-macroscopic size, from hydrodynamic arguments the Stokes [5] law can be derived.\nIt gives an expression of the friction coefficient \u03be = CR\u03b7 where R is the size of the particles,\n\u03b7 the viscosity of the solvent and C a numerical coefficient depending on the possible choices\nof boundary conditions at the interface between solvated particles and solvent.\nHowever in many suspensions, such as ionic solutions, the values of ratios of masses and\nsizes between the solvated particles and solvent molecules are only of the order of 10 and\nthe possibility that the solvated particles can be considered as Brownian particles becomes\nquestionable. Several theoretical works [6,7] and works based on numerical simulations\n[8\u201311] have been devoted to this question. The main problem addressed in these works was\nthat of the determination of the lower bounds of the size and mass ratios above which, to a\ngood approximation, the motion of the solvated particles is Brownian. The criterion chosen\nto locate these bounds was that the diffusion coefficient of the solvated particles obeys\nto the relation between the diffusion coefficient D and friction coefficient \u03be strictly valid\nonly for brownian particles D = kB T /\u03be (kB is Boltzmann's constant, T the temperature\nof the solvent). The main concern, when the Stokes estimate of \u03be is used, is the choice\nof the hydrodynamic boundary condition between solvated particles and solvent which is\nwell defined only when the solvated particle has a macroscopic size. This last shortcoming\ncan be overcome by computing \u03be from its exact expression for a Brownian particle derived\nby Kirkwood [12] and later, more rigourously, from multi-scale analysis [2,13]. Obviously\nthis method seems the correct way to proceed in order to check the brownian behavior of a\nsolvated particle. However, as it was discussed in the literature [8,10,12,14\u201316], this method\nis not easy to use in simulations due to important finite size effects. This work is devoted\nto discuss this problem and to establish in what conditions, in a numerical simulation, the\nfriction coefficient of a solvated particle of large mass and size can be credibly determined.\nThe friction coefficient \u03be is given in terms of the integration on time t of the equilibrium autocorrelation function < F(0) . F(t) > of the instantaneous microscopic force F(t)\nexperienced by the Brownian particle :\n\n2\n\n\f\u03be=\n\n1\n3kB T\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n< F(0) . F(t) > dt .\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nThis expression of the friction coefficient has the same form as the Green-Kubo relations\nused to calculate the transport coefficients.\nFor finite size systems, the computation of \u03be from Eq. (1) and, more generally, that of\nthe transport coefficients from Green-Kubo relations are confronted with a problem that we\nillustrate for this specific case. From the momentum conservation, the force F(t) acting on\none Brownian particle in a solvent of N molecules is given by\nF(t) = \u2212\n\nN\nX\nd vi (t)\nd P(t)\n\u2261 \u2212\u1e56(t) = \u2212\n,\nm\ndt\ndt\ni=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the solvent molecules with velocities vi (t) (i = 1, ..., N) and \u03beN can\nbe written as\n\u03beN = lim \u03beN (t)\n\n(3)\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt\n1\nlim\n< F(0) .

(4) vanishes by symmetry on time and it is expected that, for\nt \u2192 \u221e, the first term also vanishes due to the loss of correlations between \u1e56(\u221e) and\nP(0), according to the ergodic postulate of the equilibrium statistical mechanics, with the\nfinal result that \u03beN should be zero. The well known way to overcome this paradox is that\nthe thermodynamic limit on N must be taken before that the limit t \u2192 \u221e is performed.\nThe argument can be summarized by guessing that at large values of t and N, \u03beN (t) can\nbe written in the form c g(at/N) where c and a are coefficients independent of N and\ng(at/N) is a decreasing function of t equal to 0 at t = \u221e and normalized to 1 at t = 0.\nBy perfoming the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e before the limit t \u2192 \u221e, \u03be is given by\nlimt\u2192\u221e {limN \u2192\u221e \u03beN (t)} = c and \u03be is now finite.\n3\n\n\fIf in simulations N is large enough, it can be expected, following the remark made by\nKirkwood in [12], that, in the range of values of t where \u03beN (t) reaches its asymptotic form \u2243\nc g(at/N), t is such as t << a/N. In this domain of t, \u03beN (t) is given by \u03beN (t) \u2243 c+acg \u2032 (0)t/N\nand presents a quasi plateau or a slow linear decay with t from which the value of \u03be in the\nthermodynamic limit can be estimated.\nAs it was proposed, for instance, in [6,10] it is possible to give a specific analytic form to\ng(at/N) by supposing that, following the Onsager's principle, the regression of the fluctuations of F(t) at large t is governed by the laws of the macroscopic hydrodynamics. According\nto these laws, the force exerted by the solvent on the Brownian particle is proportional to\nthe momentum P(t) carried by the solvent, i.e.\nF(t) =\n\n\u03beo\nP(t)\nNm\n\n(5)\n\na relation which implies that\n< P(t) . P(0) >N = 3NmkB T exp(\u2212\n\n\u03beo\nt)\nNm\n\n(6)\n\nand then\n\u03beN (t) = \u2212\n\n\u03beo\n< \u1e56(t) . P(0) >N\n= \u03beo exp(\u2212\nt).\n3kB T\nNm\n\n(7)\n\nAt large N and t such as t << \u03beo/Nm, an expansion of the exponential yields to a linear\nexpression, similar to that of \u03beN (t) given above, allowing to determine the friction coefficient\nas\n\u03beN (t) = \u03beo (1 \u2212\n\n\u03beo\nt + ... ) .\nNm\n\n(8)\n\nIn order to investigate the possibility of a computation of \u03be following the procedure\ndescribes above, we have realized a set of molecular-dynamics simulations with increasing\nvalues of N.\nThe studied systems are made of N molecules of solvent enclosed in a periodic cubic box\nof volume V . In this box, a particle is immersed and supposed to have a size and mass M\n4\n\n\flarge compared of those of the solvent molecules. Hence the mass of this particle satisfies\nto the condition required so that the relation between D and \u03be, given above, applies. When\nM is large, it is possible to consider that, in the time scale accessible in a simulation, the\nparticle is immobile.\nThe molecules and the fixed particle interact through a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential\nmodified with a cubic spline, as describe in a previous paper [11]. This potential has the\nform vij (r) = \u01ebij f (r/\u03c3ij ) where the indices i, j = 1 or 2 refer to the solvent and fixed\nparticle, respectively. The parameters \u03c3ij are such as \u03c312 = (\u03c311 + \u03c322 )/2, and \u01ebij are equal\n\u01eb12 = \u01eb22 = \u01eb11 . The unit of time is chosen equal to \u03c40 =\n\nq\n\n2\n(m\u03c311\n/\u01eb11 ) and that of energy,\n\nlength, and mass are chosen, respectively, equal to \u01eb11 , \u03c311 , and m. The values of the solvent\n3\ndensity and temperature are \u03c1\u2217 \u2261 N\u03c311\n/V \u2243 0.84 and T \u2217 \u2261 kB T /\u01eb11 = 1.0, thus specifying\n\na dense liquid state near the triple point of the LJ system. The simulations were realized\nat constant energy using the standard Verlet algorithm [17], with a time step \u2206t = 0.005 \u03c40.\nTypical simulation runs are carried out for 20000 equilibration time steps followed by 4 to 8\nmillions time steps. During the runs, the time autocorrelation function of F(t) is computed\nover a sequence of blocks of 4000\u2206t to allow an evaluation of statistical errors. We have\nconsidered two different sizes for the Brownian particle, namely \u03c322 = 4.0 and 7.0 and\nsystems of increasing values of N : 864, 1500, 5324, 12000, 32000 and 55296. In order to\nmaintain constant the value of the pressure, the volume of the simulation box was slightly\nincreased, when \u03c322 was varied from 4.0 to 7.0.\nWe first discuss the case of \u03c322 = 4.0. In Fig. 1, we show \u03beN (t) as a function of reduced\ntime t/\u03c40 . When N is increased from 864 to 32000, the behavior of \u03beN (t) changes drastically\nin the domain of t/\u03c40 > 5.0. For the low values of N, \u03beN (t) goes rapidly to zero and for\nthe two larger values of N, it is almost constant. Qualitatively, this behavior of \u03beN (t) at\nlarge time corresponds to that expected when N increases. In particular, if this behavior\nis described by Eq. (7), the results presented in Fig. 1 can be interpreted as the transition\nbetween the exponential decrease of \u03beN (t) given by Eq. (7) and the linear decrease, at large\nN, given by Eq. (8). Quantitatively, it should be possible to obtain the value of \u03be from the\n5\n\n\ffit of \u03beN (t), for t/\u03c40 between 12 and 20, to an exponential form when N is \u2243 1000 and a\nlinear form when N is \u2243 20000.\nHowever, the possibility that the values of \u03be, determined from the fits made at different\nvalues of N, coincide within the statistical uncertainties, supposes that finite size effects, in\nparticular those associated to the use of the periodic boundary conditions, do not affect the\nlong time behavior of \u03beN (t). From the fit of the multiplicative constant of the exponential\n(cf. Eq. (7)) the estimates of \u03be are : 219.4 (N = 864), 144.7 (N = 1500) and 122.9\n(N = 5324) and from that of the constant term in the linear form (cf. Eq. 8) they are :\n113.3 (N = 12000) and 110.7 (N = 32000). Clearly, for the two large systems these values of\n\u03be agree within the statistical error equal to 10-15%. But the factor of 2 between the values\nfound at N = 864 and N = 32000 must be attributed to finite size effects. The side lenghts\nL of the simulation cells being for these two values of N equal to \u223c 10 and \u223c 35, due to\nthe periodic boundary conditions the fixed particle is distant from these nearest replica by\nthe same lengths. The sound velocity cs of the solvent, for the considered thermodynamic\nstate, being in reduced units \u223c 6, gives typical times L/cs of 1.5 and 6 beyond of which\nthe finite size effects resulting from the mutual influence between the fixed particle and its\nreplicas can affect the correlation function. The magnitude of these effects on the value\nof \u03be is difficult to assess. It has been quantitatively discussed only for the bulk values of\nthe transport coefficients of diffusion or viscosity in dense fluids [18], corrections of about\n\u223c 10% have been found for systems of N \u223c 1000 molecules and they seem much larger on\n\u03be. Other estimates of \u03be are obtained from the fit of the coefficient of t in the exponential\n(Eq. (7)) or the linear approximation (Eq. (8)). For the small values N, we obtained 205.5\n(N = 864) and 143.3 (N = 1500), for the large values of N, 98.4 and 91.1. These results\nseem to confirm that the asymptotic behavior of \u03beN (t) is well described by Eq. (7) taking\ninto account the finite size effects.\n\n6\n\n\fFIGURES\n200\nN=864\nN=1500\nN=5324\nN=12000\nN=32000\n\n150\n\n110\n100\n90\n110\n100\n\n\u03be\u039d(t)\n\n90\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nt/\u03c40\n\n20\n\n\u03beN (t) for the fixed particle of size \u03c322 = 4.0 and increasing values of N .

The \u03beN (t) functions\nare plotted in Fig. 2. for N equal to 5324, 12000, 32000 and 55296. The behavior of \u03beN (t),\nwhen N increases, is similar to that obtained with the particle of size \u03c322 = 4.0, but it is only\nfor N \u2265 32000 that \u03beN (t) presents a slow linear decrease for t/\u03c40 > 10.0. For the particle\nof size \u03c322 = 4.0, we remark that this latter behavior is reached for systems smaller by a\nfactor \u223c 2 and, then, the size of the fixed particle has an important influence on the value\nof the system size where \u03beN (t) exhibits a slow linear decrease at large time. This remark is\nconfirmed by the results of the fits of \u03beN (t) by an exponential at N = 5324 and 12000 or a\nlinear function at N = 32000 and 55296. The values of \u03be are 217.0, 244.2, 209.3 and 207.5\nrespectively. We notice that, the linear behavior of \u03beN (t), at large t, corresponds obvioulsy\nto the fact that < F(0) . F(t) > decreases very slowly in the same domain of t. This point\nis illustrated in Fig. 3 where this behavior is clearly seen for N = 12000, 32000 and 55296\nwithin statistical errors.\n0\n\u2212100\n\n<F(t).F(0)>N\n\n\u2212200\n\u2212300\n\u2212400\n\u2212500\n\u2212600\n\u2212700\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nt/\u03c40\n\n15 0\n\n5\n\n10\nt/\u03c40\n\n15 0\n\n5\n\n10\nt/\u03c40\n\n15\n\nFIG. 3.

Solid lines : estimate of its almost constant value from its average for t/\u03c40 > 12.0 and < 20.0 : \u223c -12.6, -6.6 and -6.1.\n\nFrom the results of the present simulations it seems needed to adopt a critical point of\n\n8\n\n\fview on the previous works made in order to determine the friction coefficient of a brownian\nparticle and to check when a particle of large masses and sizes can be considered as a\nbrownian particle. The most important criticism is that, in these works the sizes of the\nsystem studied in the simulations were too small. This remark applies, for instance, to the\nsimulations presented in [6] where the friction coefficient of a fixed hard sphere of diameter\n4d in a solvent made of hard spheres of diameter d was computed at a density \u03c1d3 \u2243 0.471.\nSuch a computation corresponds closely to that made in this work for a fixed particle with\n\u03c322 = 4.0. In [6], the largest considered system had a size of N = 1500 which, as discussed\nabove, seems too small to obtain a good estimate of \u03be from an exponential fit of \u03beN (t) at\nlarge times and, then, to check the validity of Stokes estimate of \u03be. The system size used\nin [10] for the computation of the friction coefficient of a fixed particle in a LJ type system\nbeing of the order of N = 1000, finite size effects should also affect the simulation data.\nAs mentionned already, the asymptotic form of \u03beN (t) at large times has been discussed in\nmany works in the literature, for instance in [14], [15] and [16], in particular the question of\nthe occurence of a domain of time where the friction coefficient \u03beN (t) should exhibit a plateau.\nIt has been proposed in [8] to bypass the search of such a plateau in \u03beN (t) by computing\n\u03be from the integration of < F(0) . F(t) > from t = 0 to the value of t = t1 where, for the\nfirst times when t increases, < F(0) . F(t1 ) > becomes 0. In our simulations t1 /\u03c40 \u2243 0.5,\nclearly from the comparison between Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of \u03beN (t) and < F(0) . F(t) >N , such a\nmethod to estimate \u03be seems problematic since the value of \u03beN (t1 ) for instance at N = 55296\ndoes not agree with the value \u03be obtained from the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of\n\u03beN (t).\nSince the present simulations show that system sizes of N \u2243 20000 are needed to correctly\nestimated \u03be, it is expected that similar system sizes are needed to compute D in order to\navoid finite size effects. For instance in [11] for N = 5324, for a brownian particle with\n\u03c322 = 4.0 and M = 60 in a LJ solvent at a thermodynamic state identical to that considered\nhere, it was found D = 0.077. By using D = kB T /\u03be this value of D agrees well with that of\n\u03be \u2243 120 obtained in this work at N = 5324, but it differs by 10% from that, computed at\n9\n\n\fN = 32000, \u03be \u2243 110. A new determination of D at N = 32000 gives D = 0.095, which now\nagrees with our estimate of \u03be at the same value of N from the slow linear decay of \u03beN (t) for\nt/\u03c40 > 12.\nIn conclusion from our simulations realized for increasing system sizes from N \u223c 1000 to\n\u223c 56000, we have shown that the qualitative behavior of < F(0) . F(t) > and, consequently,\nthat of \u03beN (t) is in excellent agreement with that guessed by Kirwood [12] and in subsequent\nworks. [15,16]. For large times, the representation of \u03beN (t) by Eq. (7), derived from a simple\nargument based on Onsager principle, seems an adequate model of this asymptotic behavior.\nFrom a quantitative point of view, in spite of simulation runs totalizing 4 to 8 millions of\ntime steps the statistical uncertainties on the friction coefficient stay of the odrer of 15%, a\nreduction of this uncertainty by a order of magnitude seems beyond what it is possible to\nmake by using present standard computers. We stress that the aim of this work was the\ninvestigation of the variation of \u03beN (t) with N. In the thermodynamic limit, the asymptotic\nbehavior of \u03beN (t) should be an algebraic decay at very large time. It was not considered\nhere, in particular, because its amplitude is much smaller than the present uncertainties on\n\u03beN (t) in this domain of time [11,18].\n\n10\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] E.
