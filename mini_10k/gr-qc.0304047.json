This is partly due to the fact that\nthis system provides a tractable, yet non-trivial, reduction of full general relativity and hence is an ideal framework to explore several issues involved in the quantization of gravity. Some intriguing phenomena, related to\nthe existence of large quantum gravity effects, have been\ndiscussed by studying precisely this model [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nIt has also been argued that some manifestations of quantum gravity, such as the smearing of light cones are, indeed, present and can be understood in this simplified\nsetting [2].\nOne of the interesting points behind the obtained results is the realization of the fact that the physical Hamiltonian is a function of the free field Hamiltonian for\na 2+1 dimensional, axially symmetric, massless scalar\nfield evolving in an auxiliary Minkowski background\n[1, 10, 11]. As we show in the first section of the paper, this free Hamiltonian naturally appears when one\nlinearizes the system, thus suggesting that, in a precise\nsense, it can be considered as the free part of an interacting model. However the full interacting Hamiltonian\nis obtained by adding a very specific type of terms to the\nfree part, namely, just functions of it. Here we plan to\nexplore the consequences of this functional relation between the two physically relevant Hamiltonians for the\nsystem and explore how this affects the causal structure\nof quantum spacetime. To this end we will pay attention\nto the smearing of the light cones due to quantum gravity\neffects within the framework of linearly polarized cylindrical waves. Instead of considering the full information\nencoded in the metric tensor we will concentrate on the\ncausal structure provided by light cones. An interesting,\nalbeit somewhat indirect way, to look at this structure is\nto study the commutators of field operators at different\n\n\u2217 jfbarbero@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\u2020 mena@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\u2021 eduardo@imaff.cfmac.csic.es\n\nspacetime points. These are the basic objects to discuss\nthe commutativity of observables and the microcausality of the model; conventionally, a physical model should\nbe such that observables commute for space-like intervals. This has been discussed in the standard perturbative quantum field theory framework for simple examples\nsuch as scalar or fermion fields (see e.g. [12]). In fact,\nmicrocausality is one of the key conditions to prove such\nimportant results as the spin-statistics theorem [12, 13].\n\nHere we will use the commutator of the scalar field that\ndescribes linearly polarized cylindrical waves as a way to\nget information about the causal structure of quantum\nspacetime. As we show later it is possible to give exact\nexpressions for this commutator both for the evolution\nprovided by the free and the full physical Hamiltonians.\nWe will use these expressions to study in a quantitative way the smearing of the light cones as a function\nof the three-dimensional gravitational constant and explore some physical issues, in particular the appearance\nof singularities as a consequence of having a Hamiltonian\nbounded from above [14, 15].\n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sec.\nII we discuss how the free Hamiltonian is derived from\nthe linearized cylindrical wave model. Sec. III deals with\nthe classical and quantum dynamics of cylindrical gravitational waves under the evolution provided both by the\nfree Hamiltonian and the physical Hamiltonian. We will\npause here to discuss and compare on a familiar example\n(the harmonic oscillator) the main features of the time\nevolution defined by functionally related Hamiltonians,\nboth from the classical and the quantum points of view.\nThis will provide valuable insights for the problem considered in this work. Sec. IV is devoted to the study of\nmicrocausality. We will look at the main features of the\nfield commutators and study the smearing of the light\ncones due to quantum gravitational effects. We end the\npaper with a discussion of the main results and perspectives for future work.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nCYLINDRICAL WAVES IN LINEARIZED\nGRAVITY\n\nLinearly polarized cylindrical waves in general relativity can be described by the spacetime metric [2, 3]:\nds2 = e\u2212\u03c8 ds23 + e\u03c8 dZ 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Z \u2208 R is the coordinate of the symmetry axis and\nds23 is the three-metric\nds23 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + e\u03b3 (dR + N R dt)2 + r2 d\u03b82 .\n\n(2)\n\nFrom this three-dimensional point of view, R \u2208 R+ and\n\u03b8 \u2208 S 1 correspond to polar coordinates, N R is the radial\ncomponent of the shift vector and N is the lapse function.\nAll metric functions (\u03b3, r, N , and N R ) depend only on\nthe time and radial coordinates, t and R.\nUnless otherwise stated, we adopt a system of units\nsuch that c = ~ = 8G3 = 1, where c is the speed of\nlight, ~ is Planck constant, and G3 is the effective Newton\nconstant per unit length in the direction of the symmetry\naxis [3]. In these units, the gravitational action of the\nsystem has the form [8, 10]\n\u0015\nZ t2 \u0014Z \u221e\ndt\nS=\n(3)\ndR (p\u03b3 \u03b3 \u0307 + pr \u1e59 + p\u03c8 \u03c8\u0307) \u2212 H ,\nt1\n\n0\n\nwhere the dot denotes the derivative with respect to t, the\np's are the momenta canonically conjugate to the metric\nvariables and H is the total Hamiltonian\n\u0011 Z \u221e\n\u0010\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndR N C + N R C R .

The\ngauge freedom associated with these constraints can be\nremoved by imposing, respectively, the gauge fixing conditions [2, 3]\n\u03c7R := r \u2212 R = 0,\n\n\u03c7 := p\u03b3 = 0.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lagrangian form of the action\ncan be obtained from the relations between momenta and\ntime derivatives of the metric provided by the Hamilton\nequations,\np\u03b3 N = \u2212e\u03b3/2 \u1e59 + e\u2212\u03b3/2 N R r \u2032 ,\n\np\u03c8 N = e\u03b3/2 r \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b3/2 N R r \u03c8 \u2032 ,\n\u0011\u2032\n\u0010\npr N = \u2212e\u03b3/2 \u03b3\u0307 + 2 N R e\u2212\u03b3/2 .\n\nFrom a three-dimensional perspective, the system describes an axially symmetric model consisting of a scalar\nfield \u03c8 coupled to gravity [2], the line element being (2).\nA particular classical solution is a vanishing scalar field in\nthree-dimensional Minkowski spacetime or, equivalently,\nMinkowski spacetime in four dimensions. In this solution,\nN = 1 and r = R, whereas the rest of metric fields and\nmomenta vanish (i.e. \u03c8 = \u03b3 = N R = p\u03c8 = p\u03b3 = pr = 0).\nIn this section, we will consider this solution as a background and discuss first-order perturbations around it.\nIn other words, we will analyze the linearized theory of\ngravity around this Minkowski spacetime, as it is usually\ndone in the perturbative, quantum field theory approach\nto gravity. In order to expand the metric fields around\nthe classical solution, let us call\nr = R + r\u0304,\n\nN = 1 + N\u0304 .\n\nUp to first-order terms in the fields, the expression of the\nthree-metric becomes\nds\u030423 = \u2212(1 + 2N\u0304 )dt2 + 2N R dtdR + (1 + \u03b3)dR2\n+(R2 + 2Rr\u0304)d\u03b82 ,\nwhile the four-dimensional metric is given by\nds\u03042 = (1 \u2212 \u03c8)ds\u030423 + (1 + \u03c8)dZ 2 .\n\n(5)\n\nHere, it is understood that the product of \u03c8 with any\nother metric field vanishes in the perturbative order considered. On the other hand, regularity on the axis of\nsymmetry imposes the following conditions:\n\u03b3(R = 0) = 0,\nr\u0304(R = 0) = 0,\n\nN R (R = 0) = 0,\nr\u0304 \u2032 (R = 0) = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nIn order to discuss the linearized gravitational system,\nwe must keep up to quadratic terms in the fields in the\naction (3). A straightforward calculation leads to the\nresult\n\u0015\nZ t2 \u0014Z \u221e\ndt\ndR (p\u03b3 \u03b3 \u0307 + pr\u0304 r\u0304 \u0307 + p\u03c8 \u03c8\u0307) \u2212 H\u0304 ,\nS\u0304 =\nt1\n0\n#\n\"\nZ \u221e\np2\u03c8\nR (\u03c8 \u2032 )2\nR R\n+\n\u2212 p\u03b3 pr\u0304 + N\u0304 C\u0304 + N C\u0304\nH\u0304 =\ndR\n2R\n2\n0\n+(2 \u2212 \u03b3\u221e ) r\u0304 \u2032 (R \u2192 \u221e).\n\nHere, pr\u0304 := pr is the momentum canonically conjugate\nto r\u0304, and the linearized constraints are:\nC\u0304 = 2r\u0304 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 ,\n\nC\u0304 R = pr\u0304 \u2212 2p\u2032\u03b3 .\n\nThe diffeomorphisms gauge freedom can be fixed just\nlike in the cylindrical reduction of general relativity,\nnamely, by demanding that r = R + r\u0304 coincides with\nthe radial coordinate [3]. We thus impose the gauge fixing condition \u03c7\u0304R := r\u0304 = 0. It is easily checked that the\nPoisson brackets {\u03c7\u0304R , C\u0304 R } of this condition with the linearized constraint do not vanish, so that the gauge fixing\n\n\f3\nis admissible. Dynamical consistency of the gauge fixing\nprocedure requires, in addition,\n\u03c7\u0304 \u0307R = {\u03c7\u0304R , H\u0304} = N R \u2212 p\u03b3 = 0.\nHence, the shift must be chosen as N R = p\u03b3 . Finally,\nthe momentum conjugate to r\u0304 is fixed by solving the\ndiffeomorphisms constraint: pr\u0304 = 2p\u2032\u03b3 . In this way, the\ncanonical pair (r\u0304, pr\u0304 ) is removed from the set of degrees\nof freedom. The action of the resulting reduced model is\nZ t2 Z \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndt\ndR p\u03b3 \u03b3 \u0307 + p\u03c8 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 N\u0304 C\u03041\nS\u03041 =\n0\n\nt1\nt2\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt1\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndt H0 \u2212 p2\u03b3 (R \u2192 \u221e) + p2\u03b3 (R = 0) .\n\nHere, C\u03041 = \u2212\u03b3 \u2032 is the Hamiltonian constraint of the reduced linearized system, and\n\"\n#\nZ \u221e\np2\u03c8\nR (\u03c8 \u2032 )2\nH0 =\ndR\n.\n(7)\n+\n2R\n2\n0\nRemarkably, the condition employed to eliminate the\nHamiltonian gauge freedom in full cylindrical gravity [3]\ncan be used as well to fix the corresponding gauge in\nthe linearized theory. The gauge fixing \u03c7\u0304 := p\u03b3 = 0\nis acceptable, because the Poisson brackets of \u03c7\u0304 and C\u03041\ndiffer from zero. In addition, consistency of the chosen\ngauge demands the vanishing of\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ \u221e\n \u0307\n\u03c7\u0304 = \u03c7\u0304 , H0 +\ndR N\u0304 C\u03041 = \u2212N\u0304 \u2032 .\n0\n\nTherefore, N\u0304 has to be independent of the radial coordinate. Actually, we can set N\u0304 = 0 by demanding that the\ntotal lapse equals the unity at spatial infinity. On the\nother hand, taking into account the regularity condition\n(6), the solution to the Hamiltonian constraint is simply\n\u03b3 = 0. This allows us to remove the canonical pair (\u03b3, p\u03b3 )\nfrom the system and arrive at a constraint-free model in\nlinearized gravity.\nThe degrees of freedom of this system are the field \u03c8\nand its momentum. The reduced action is\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\nZ t2 \u0014\ndR p\u03c8 \u03c8\u0307 .\ndt \u2212H0 +\nS\u03042 =\nt1\n\n0\n\nNote that H0 , given in Eq. (7), is the Hamiltonian of\na massless scalar field with axial symmetry in threedimensions. Furthermore, in the gauge that we have\nselected, the three-dimensional metric of the linearized\ngravitational theory is exactly that of Minkowski spacetime and contains no physical degrees of freedom. The\nscalar field \u03c8 determines the norm of the Killing vector\n\u2202Z , and appears in the four-dimensional metric of the\ngauge-fixed, linearized model in the form (5), but with\nds\u030423 substituted by the flat metric\n\u0001\n(8)\nds\u030423 f := \u2212dT 2 + dR2 + R2 d\u03b82 ,\n\nwhere we have renamed T the time coordinate of the\nreduced system.\nSummarizing, the perturbative description provided in\nlinearized gravity for cylindrical waves with linear polarization around four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is\nequivalent to a massless scalar field with axial symmetry\nin a three-dimensional flat background. The dynamics of\nthis field is dictated by the free Hamiltonian H0 , which\ngenerates the evolution in the Minkowskian time T .\nIt is worth noticing that the action and metric of the\ngauge-fixed model in linearized gravity reproduce in fact\nthe results that one would obtain from the gauge-fixed\nmodel in full cylindrical gravity by working just in the\nfirst perturbative order, i.e., by keeping in the action and\nmetric, respectively, up to quadratic and linear terms in\nthe field \u03c8 and its momentum. In this sense, the gauge\nfixing and linearization procedures commute.\nIII.\n\nTIME COORDINATES AND EVOLUTION\nFOR CYLINDRICAL WAVES\nA.\n\nSystems with Functionally Related\nHamiltonians\n\nOne of the significant features of gravitational cylindrical waves is the existence of two distinct, physically\nrelevant Hamiltonians (or equivalently two distinct time\ncoordinates) to define both the classical and quantum\nevolution. One is the Hamiltonian H0 [given in Eq. (7)]\nthat generates the dynamics in the linearized gravitational theory; the other is the Hamiltonian H that provides the energy per unit length along the symmetry axis\nin general relativity [2, 14, 15]. In fact, they are functionally dependent, since H = 2(1 \u2212 e\u2212H0 /2 ). In order\nto gain insight into the relation that can be established\nbetween the dynamics associated with these two different Hamiltonians, we open this section by discussing a\nsimilar situation in a very simple example provided by\nthe harmonic oscillator.\nThe usual description of the harmonic oscillator in a\nphase space coordinatized by (x0 , p0 ) comes from its standard Hamiltonian h0 (x0 , p0 ) = (p20 + \u03c9 2 x20 )/2. The dynamics is given by the Hamilton equations\ndp0\ndx0\n= p0 ,\n= \u2212w2 x0 .\ndT\ndT\nThe general solution can be written as\n\u0001\n1\nx0 (T ) = \u221a\nae\u2212i\u03c9T + a\u2020 ei\u03c9T ,\n2\u03c9\n\u0001\n\u2212i\u03c9\nae\u2212i\u03c9T \u2212 a\u2020 ei\u03c9T ,\np0 (T ) = \u221a\n2\u03c9\n\nwhere a and its complex conjugate a\u2020 are fixed by the\ninitial conditions.\nConsider next a phase space (x, p) with Hamiltonian\nh = F (h0 ), i.e. a function of the standard Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator. For instance, the case\n\n\f4\nF (ho ) = h20 arises in the context of quantum optics, in\nrelation with the propagation of light in non-linear Kerr\nmedia [16]. The equations of motion now read\ndx\n= {x, F (h0 )} = F \u2032 (h0 )p ,\ndt\ndp\n= {p, F (h0 )} = \u2212\u03c9 2 F \u2032 (h0 )x ,\ndt\nwhere F \u2032 denotes the derivative of F with respect to its\nargument. These new equations can be easily solved by\nmeans of a change of time. Specifically, making use of the\ntime independence of the Hamiltonian h0 (h0 = wa\u2020 a on\nsolutions to the equations of motion), we can introduce\nthe new time parameter T (t) = F \u2032 (h0 )t. Then, the functions x(t) = x0 [T (t)], p(t) = p0 [T (t)] and the new time\nT serve us to transform the Hamilton equations into the\nstandard ones corresponding to the harmonic oscillator.\nSo, the classical solutions are\n1 h \u2212i\u03c9F \u2032 (\u03c9a\u2020a)t \u2020 i\u03c9F \u2032 (\u03c9a\u2020a)t i\n,\nae\n+a e\nx(t) = x0 [T (t)] = \u221a\n2\u03c9\ni\n\u2032\n\u2020\n\u2212i\u03c9 h \u2212i\u03c9F \u2032 (\u03c9a\u2020a)t\nae\n\u2212 a\u2020 ei\u03c9F (\u03c9a a)t .\np(t) = p0 [T (t)] = \u221a\n2\u03c9\nWhat we find is an energy dependent redefinition of time\nthat induces a different time change for each solution to\nthe equations of motion.\nThe situation in the quantum theory is quite different.\nThe reason lies on the fact than in quantum mechanics\na physical state does not need to have a definite energy.\nThen, a \"change of time\" of the form T\u0302 = F \u2032 (\u01250 )t has\nnon-trivial consequences for the dynamics.\nThe usual quantum theory for the harmonic oscillator\ncan be described by introducing a Fock space with cre\u2020\nation and annihilation operators\nPa , a. Every initial state\ncan be expressed as |\u03c6(0)i = \u221e\nn=0 cn |ni, where cn are\nFourier coefficients (with the convenient normalization)\nand |ni are energy eigenvectors (that is, \u01250 |ni = nw|ni).\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, evolving with \u01250 , we find\n|\u03c60 (T )i = e\u2212i\u01250 T |\u03c6(0)i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\ncn e\u2212inwT |ni .\n\nHowever, if the same state |\u03c6(0)i evolves in time according to the evolution generated by \u0125 = F (\u01250 ), we get1\n|\u03c6F (t)i = e\u2212i\u0125t |\u03c6(0)i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\ncn e\u2212iF (nw)t |ni .\n\nHence we do not recover an analogous situation to that\nfound in the classical system by replacing (formally) the\n\n1\n\nNotice that the operators \u01250 and \u0125 = F (\u01250 ) act on the same\nHilbert space. Moreover, if we demand the function F to have a\nunique absolute minimum at 0, the two Hamiltonians have also\nthe same vacuum.\n\ntime T in |\u03c60 (T )i with T\u0302 = F \u2032 (\u01250 )t, because |\u03c6F (t)i 6=\n|\u03c60 (T\u0302 (t))i except for linear homogeneous functions F .\nMoreover, the properties of the states |\u03c60 (T )i and |\u03c6F (t)i\nare quite different. For example, if we consider the\nbounded Hamiltonian \u0125 = F (\u01250 ) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u01250 it is obvious that the high energy contributions to |\u03c6F (t)i are\nessentially frozen in time with respect to the evolution of\nthe low energy ones, in the sense that the phase of the\nformer type of contributions remains practically coherent\nin time.\nB.\n\nFunctionally Related Hamiltonians and\nCylindrical Waves\n\nLet us turn now to the discussion of our gravitational\nsystem. We will deal with the Einstein-Rosen family of\nlinearly polarized gravitational waves [17]. These waves\ndisplay the so-called whole cylindrical symmetry [18],\nnamely, they correspond to topologically trivial spacetimes which possess two linearly independent, commuting, spacelike, and hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector\nfields. It is well known [8, 10] that these spacetimes admit coordinates (T, R, \u03b8, Z) such that the metric is given\nby\nds2 = e\u03b3\u2212\u03c8 (\u2212dT 2 + dR2 ) + e\u2212\u03c8 R2 d\u03b82 + e\u03c8 dZ 2 ,\nwhere \u03c8 and \u03b3 are functions of only R and T . When the\nEinstein equations are imposed, \u03c8 encodes the physical\ndegrees of freedom and satisfies the usual wave equation\nfor an axially symmetric massless scalar field in threedimensions:\n1\n2\n\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202R \u03c8 = 0 .\n\u2202T2 \u03c8 \u2212 \u2202R\nR\nThe metric function \u03b3 can be expressed in terms of this\nfield on the classical solutions [2, 3]. One gets\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 R\n\u03b3(R) =\ndR\u0304 R\u0304 (\u2202T \u03c8)2 + (\u2202R\u0304 \u03c8)2 ,\n2 0\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 \u221e\n\u03b3\u221e =\ndR R (\u2202T \u03c8)2 + (\u2202R \u03c8)2 .\n(9)\n2 0\n\nNote that \u03b3(R) and \u03b3\u221e are the energy of the scalar\nfield in a ball of radius R and in the whole of the twodimensional flat space, respectively. Furthermore, \u03b3\u221e\ncoincides with the Hamiltonian H0 given in Eq. (7) [2].\nNevertheless, to reach a unit asymptotic timelike\nKilling vector field in the actual four-dimensional spacetime, with respect to which one can truly introduce\na physical notion of energy (per unit length) [14, 15],\none must make use of a different system of coordinates,\nnamely (t, R, \u03b8, Z) where T = e\u2212\u03b3\u221e /2 t. In these new\ncoordinates the metric has the form\nds2 = e\u03b3\u2212\u03c8 (\u2212e\u2212\u03b3\u221e dt2 + dR2 ) + e\u2212\u03c8 R2 d\u03b82 + e\u03c8 dZ 2 .\nAssuming as a boundary condition that the metric function \u03c8 falls off sufficiently fast as R \u2192 \u221e, the above\n\n\f5\nmetric describes asymptotically flat spacetimes with a,\ngenerally non-zero, deficit angle. In this asymptotic region \u2202t is a unit timelike vector. The Einstein field equations can be obtained from a Hamiltonian action principle [8, 14, 15] where the on-shell Hamiltonian is given in\nterms of that for the free scalar field by\nH = E(H0 ) = 2(1 \u2212 e\u2212H0 /2 ).\n\n(10)\n\nOwing to these reasons, in the following we will refer to\nt as the physical time and to H as the physical Hamiltonian.\nWhen we use the T -time and impose regularity at the\norigin R = 0 [2], the classical solutions for the field \u03c8 can\nbe expanded in the form\nZ \u221e\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndk\n\u221a J0 (Rk) A(k)e\u2212ikT + A\u2020 (k)eikT .\n\u03c8(R, T ) =\n2\n0\n\nA(k) and A\u2020 (k) are fixed by the initial conditions and are\ncomplex conjugate to each other, because \u03c8 and J0 (the\nzeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind) are real.\nFrom Eq. (9), we then obtain\nZ \u221e\n\u03b3 \u221e = H0 =\ndk kA\u2020 (k)A(k).\n0\n\nUsing this formula, we can express the field in the t-frame\nas\n\u03c8E (R, t) =\nZ \u221e\ni\nh\n\u2212\u03b3\u221e /2\n\u2212\u03b3\u221e /2\ndk\n\u221a J0 (Rk) A(k)e\u2212ikte\n.\n+A\u2020 (k)eikte\n2\n0\nNotice that \u03c8(R, 0) = \u03c8E (R, 0).\nIn principle, the quantization of the field \u03c8 can be\ncarried out in a standard way. We can introduce a\nFock space in which \u03c8\u0302(R, 0), the quantum counterpart\nof \u03c8(R, 0), is an operator-valued distribution [19]. Its\naction is determined by those of \u00c2(k) and \u00c2\u2020 (k), the\nusual annihilation and creation operators, whose only\nnon-vanishing commutators are\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k1 ), \u00c2\u2020 (k2 ) = \u03b4(k1 , k2 ).\n(11)\nExplicitly,\n\nZ\n\u03c8\u0302(R, 0) = \u03c8\u0302E (R, 0) =\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nh\ni\ndk\n\u221a J0 (Rk) \u00c2(k)+ \u00c2\u2020 (k) . (12)\n2\n\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, operators do not evolve, and\nthe problem of the time evolution is transferred to the\nphysical states. We will return later to this issue. In the\nHeisenberg picture, on the contrary, operators change in\ntime and states remain fixed. In this case, the value of\nthe quantum field \u03c8\u0302 at any time can be obtained from\nits value at T = t = 0, evolving in one of the two times\nthat we have at hand. One is the physical time t, with\nassociated Hamiltonian H given in Eq. (10). The other is\n\nthe time T of the auxiliary three-dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime, its Hamiltonian being that of a massless scalar\nfield, H0 . From our discussion in Sec. II, this time can\nbe identified with the perturbative time (denoted also by\nT ) that arises in the study of the Einstein-Rosen waves\nin linearized gravity.\nIn the perturbative time T , the evolution is provided\nby the unitary operator \u00db0 (T ) = exp(\u2212iT \u01240 ) where\nZ \u221e\n\u01240 =\ndk k \u00c2\u2020 (k)\u00c2(k)\n(13)\n0\n\nis the quantum Hamiltonian of an axially symmetric\nscalar field in three dimensions. Then\n\u03c8\u0302(R, T )= \u00db0\u2020 (T )\u03a8(R, 0)\u00db0 (T )\nZ \u221e\ni\nh\ndk\n\u221a J0 (Rk) \u00c2(k)e\u2212ikT + \u00c2\u2020 (k)eikT . (14)\n=\n2\n0\nThe quantization procedure in this case is very simple:\nwe have substituted the initial conditions A(k) and A\u2020 (k)\nin the classical solution by the corresponding quantum\noperators.\nThe situation changes when we choose the physical\ntime t as the time parameter. The quantum Hamiltonian can be defined as \u0124 = E(\u01240 ) = 2(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u01240 /2 ).\nWe can then reach a unitary evolution by means of\n\u00db (t) = exp(\u2212it\u0124). This leads to the following time\nevolved operators\ni\nh\n\u00c2E (k, t) := \u00db \u2020 (t)\u00c2(k)\u00db (t) = exp \u2212itE(k)e\u2212\u01240 /2 \u00c2(k),\ni\nh\n(15)\n\u00c2\u2020E (k, t) = \u00c2\u2020 (k) exp itE(k)e\u2212\u01240 /2 ,\n\nwhere E(k) = 2(1 \u2212 e\u2212k/2 ). It is important to realize\nthat the quantum evolution in the physical t-frame is\nnot obtained by changing A(k), A\u2020 (k), and \u03b3\u221e by their\ndirect quantum counterparts. In fact, by restoring the\nvalue of the dimensionful constants ~ and G3 , we can\nwrite E(k) = (1 \u2212 e\u22124\u1e20k )/(4G3 ) with \u1e20 = ~G3 , so that\nt\nE(k) = tk + o(~),\n~\nand we can expand \u00c2E (k, t) and \u00c2\u2020E (k, t) in powers of ~,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u00c2E (k, t) = exp \u2212itke\u22124\u1e20\u01240 \u00c2(k) + o(~),\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u00c2\u2020E (k, t) = \u00c2\u2020 (k) exp itke\u22124\u1e20\u01240 + o(~).\n\n(Here, we have expressed \u01240 with dimensions of an inverse length)\nSetting again 8\u1e20 = 1, the expansion above clearly\nshows that the quantum evolution of the creation and\nannihilation variables in the physical time differs from\nthe \"classical evolution\" in higher-order quantum corrections.\nThis unusual behavior can be partially corrected in the\nsense that one can actually find an operator for H such\n\n\f6\nthat the quantum evolution in the t-time is similar to the\nclassical one. In fact, if one considers the normal ordered\nHamiltonian \u0124nor =: \u0124 : and its associated unitary evolution operator \u00dbnor = exp(\u2212it\u0124nor ), it is easy to prove\nthat\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00c2nor (k, t) = exp \u2212itk : e\u2212\u01240 /2 : \u00c2(k),\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00c2\u2020nor (k, t) = \u00c2\u2020 (k) exp itk : e\u01240 /2 : .\n\nTherefore, the quantum evolution in t given by \u0124nor parallels that encountered in the classical picture. Unfortunately, there is a severe problem with this quantum\ndynamics that renders it physically unacceptable: the\nHamiltonian \u0124nor is unbounded both from above and\nbelow [2].\nObviously, the different possibilities for the unitary\ntime evolution of the field \u03c8\u0302 considered here are closely\nrelated. Specifically, there exists a unitary mapping between both types of evolution. This is a consequence of\nthe fact that they are both unitary and coincide with\nthe identity in the same Hilbert space at T = t = 0.\nSo, if we denote the operators evolved from X\u0302(0) in\nthe times T and t by X\u0302(T ) = \u00db0\u2020 (T )X\u0302(0)\u00db0 (T ) and\nX\u0302E (t) = \u00db \u2020 (t)X\u0302(0)\u00db (t), respectively, we obtain\nX\u0302E (t) = \u00db \u2020 (t)\u00db0 (T )X\u0302(T )\u00db0\u2020 (T )\u00db (t) .\nThen, we can go from one evolution to the other by means\nof the unitary operator \u00db0\u2020 (T )\u00db (t).\nLet us close this section with a few comments about\nthe Fock space on which the field \u03c8\u0302 acts. In the Heisenberg picture the states do not depend on time. They\nare constructed by successive actions of the time independent creation operators on the vacuum of the theory.\nIt is important to point out that both \u01240 and \u0124 act on\nthe same Hilbert space and have the same vacuum, that\nwill be referred to as |0i. Explicitly, given any square integrable complex function \u03c6n (k1 , . . . , kn ) (with the convenient normalization) we can write a n-particle state in\nthe form\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n|\u03c6n i = dk1* * * dkn \u03c6n (k1 , . . . , kn )\u00c2\u2020 (k1 )* * * \u00c2\u2020 (kn )|0i.\n0\n\n0\n\nAccording to the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics, the measurable physical quantities correspond\nto expectation values of observables. We can go over to\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger picture by assigning the time evolution\nto the quantum states\nX(t; \u03c6) = h\u03c6(0)|\u00db \u2020(t)X\u0302(0)\u00db(t)|\u03c6(0)i =h\u03c6(t)|X\u0302 (0)|\u03c6(t)i.\nDefining |\u03c6E (t)i = \u00db (t)|\u03c6(0)i, |\u03c6(T )i = \u00db0 (T )|\u03c6(0)i,\nand noticing that the U -operators satisfy\ni\u2202t \u00db (t) = \u0124 \u00db (t),\n\ni\u2202T \u00db0 (T ) = \u01240 \u00db0 (T ) ,\n\nit is straightforward to see that the evolved states are\nsolutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equations\ni\u2202t |\u03c6E (t)i = \u0124|\u03c6E (t)i,\n\ni\u2202T |\u03c6(T )i = \u01240 |\u03c6(T )i .\n\nAs in the Heisenberg picture, the unitary operator\n\u00db (t)\u00db0\u2020 (T ) provides the bridge between the two kinds\nof quantum evolution,\n|\u03c6E (t)i = \u00db (t)\u00db0\u2020 (T )|\u03c6(T )i .\nParticularizing the above results to the case of n-particle\nstates we readily get that, for the T -time,\n|\u03c6n (T )i = \u00db0 (T )|\u03c6n i =\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndk1* * * dkn e\u2212iktot T\u03c6n (k1 , ..., kn )\u00c2\u2020(k1 )* * * \u00c2\u2020(kn )|0i\n0\n\n0\n\nPn\nwhere ktot = j=1 kj . Notice that |\u03c6n (T )i is a superposition of eigenvectors of \u01240 with eigenvalues equal to ktot .\nOn the other hand, if we evolve the states with \u00db (t), it\nis not difficult to check that\n|\u03c6E,n (t)i = \u00db (t)|\u03c6n i =\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\ndk1* * * dkn e\u2212iE(ktot )t \u03c6n (k1 , ..., kn )\u00c2\u2020(k1 )* * *\u00c2\u2020(kn )|0i.\n0\n\n0\n\nIn other words, |\u03c6E,n (t)i is a superposition of eigenvectors of \u0124, each of them with energy E(ktot ).

Some relevant information may be lost, but\nthe availability of explicit exact expressions for commutators [even under the evolution given by the Hamiltonian\n(10)] opens up the possibility of getting precise information about the quantum causal structure of spacetime. In\nparticular we will see how the light cones get smeared by\nquantum corrections in a precise and quantitative way.\nAs is well known, the study of causality in perturbative\nquantum field theory requires the consideration of measurements of observables at different spacetime points\nand their mutual influence. The key question is whether\nmeasurements taken at spatial separations commute or\n\n\f7\n\n[\u03c8\u0302(R1 , T1 ), \u03c8\u0302(R2 , T2 )] =\nZ \u221e\ndkJ0 (R1 k)J0 (R2 k) sin[(T2 \u2212 T1 )k]. (16)\ni\n0\n\nLet us discuss the main features of this commutation\nfunction, that we will refer to in the following as the\nH0 -commutator. To begin with we can easily see that,\nas it happens for the familiar free field theories, the commutator (16) is a c-number, i.e. it is proportional to the\nidentity in the Fock space. In addition, for R1 fixed, let\nus call regions I, II, and III the regions of the (R2 , T2 \u2212T1 )\nplane defined, respectively, by 0 < |T2 \u2212 T1 | < |R2 \u2212 R1 |,\n|R2 \u2212 R1 | < |T2 \u2212 T1 | < R2 + R1 , and R1 + R2 < |T2 \u2212 T1 |.\nThen, it can be shown that the H0 -commutator\nPSfragvanishes\nreplacements\nin region I, whereas in region II it can be written as [21]\n[\u03c8\u0302(R1 , T1 ), \u03c8\u0302(R2 , T2 )] =\n\uf8ebs\n\uf8f6\n2 \u2212(R \u2212R )2\n1\ni\n(T\n\u2212T\n)\n2\n1\n2\n1 \uf8f8\n\u221a\nK\uf8ed\n.\n\u03c0 R1 R2\n4R1 R2\n\nE(H0 ) singularity\n\nnot. The relevant commutators can be seen to be proT2 \u2212 T1\nportional to those of the quantum fields at two different\nspacetime points x and y. For a free massless scalar field\nH0 singularity\ndescribed by the standard Lagrangian, this commutator\nis a (c-number) function of x and y that is exactly zero\nwhen x\u2212y is space-like [12]. This means that observables\nIII\nat points separated by spatial intervals commute. Something similar happens for fermions described by the usual\nLagrangians if, instead of commutators, one takes anticommutators of the fields (observables for fermion fields\ncan be written as even powers of them and the relevant\ncommutators can be written in terms of anticommutators\nof the basic fields) [12].\nIn the case that we are considering in this work the\nonly physical local degree of freedom that we have\nis replacements\ngiven\nPSfrag\nby the scalar field \u03c8. What we will do in the following\nis discussing microcausality by considering the different\ntime evolutions introduced in the first part of the paper.\nI\nWe start by computing [\u03c8\u0302(R1 , T1 ), \u03c8\u0302(R2 , T2 )] for the\nfield operators (14) obtained in the Heisenberg picture\nby evolving the field at time T = 0 with the Hamiltonian\n\u01240 given in Eq.

Recall that the Hamiltonian \u01240 is given by Eq. (13), where we choose the normalization of the creation and annihilation operators so\nthat the commutation relation (11) is satisfied (with no\n~ in the r.h.s.). Notice that, with this convention, \u00c2(k),\n\u01240 , and \u0124 have formally the same dimensions as \u1e201/2 (or\nk \u22121/2 ), k, and G\u22121\n3 (or ~k), respectively. To distinguish\nthe field operators evolved with the new Hamiltonian \u0124,\nwe will denote them by \u03c8\u0302E (R, t). In order to compute\nthe commutator [\u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )], we make use of\nthe expressions (15) for the creation and annihilation operators evolved in t, which can also be written as\nh \u0010\n\u0011i\n\u00c2E (k, t) = \u00c2(k) exp it E(\u01240 \u2212 k) \u2212 E(\u01240 ) ,\nh \u0010\n\u0011i\n\u00c2\u2020E (k, t) = \u00c2\u2020 (k) exp it E(\u01240 + k) \u2212 E(\u01240 ) .

First we see that the singularity that originates in the axis in the H0 case is not present when the\nevolution is dictated by E(H0 ); this can be interpreted as\na blurring of the axis due to quantum corrections. Second we see that a completely different kind of singularity\npops up when the evolution is generated by E(H0 ). From\na mathematical point of view its origin is clearly related\nto the fact that the energy is bounded from above and,\nhence, for large values of k the integrand is just a product\nof two J0 Bessel functions (which give a divergent integral\nif their arguments coincide).

Note that, in contrast with\nthe evolution given by H0 , for which the commutation\nfunction is a c-number,\nthe situation now\n\u0003 is more com\u0002\nplicated because \u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 ) is an operator,\nas it happens in interacting theories. We will analyze two\ntypes of matrix elements for it, namely, the expectation\nvalue on the vacuum and on one-particle states. In addition, we will briefly comment on the expectation value\non coherent states.\n\u2022 Vacuum expectation value.\nh0| [\u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )] |0i =\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\nt2 \u2212 t1\ni8\u1e20 dk J0 (R1 k)J0 (R2 k) sin\n(1\u2212e\u22124\u1e20k ) . (19)\n4\u1e20\n0\nIn the following we will discuss the differences and similarities of this matrix element and the H0 -commutation\nfunction.\nWe point out that the factor sin[(T2 \u2212 T1 )k] that appears in the integrand of the H0 -commutator is substituted now by sin[(t2 \u2212 t1 )(1 \u2212 e\u22124\u1e20k )/(4\u1e20)]. They coincide for k \u2192 0, but the former of these functions oscillates\nfor all values of k whereas the latter approaches a constant value when k \u2192 \u221e. This changes the convergence\nproperties of the integral. In particular it is straightforward to see that the \u0002integral (19) diverges\nwhenever\n\u0003\nR1 = R2 (except if sin (t2 \u2212 t1 )/(4\u1e20) = 0) but converges otherwise. Therefore, the vacuum expectation\nvalue has a singularity structure that differs from the one\n\n\u22124\u1e20k\n\n)/(4\u1e20)\nand projecting onto \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )|0i. The eitj (1\u2212e\nfactor (for j = 1 or 2) goes to a phase that depends only\non tj as k \u2192 \u221e. So, if R1 = R2 , the coefficients of the\nlinear superposition defining, respectively, \u03c8\u0302E (R, t1 )|0i\nand \u03c8\u0302E (R, t2 )|0i differ only by a constant phase for large\nvalues of k. This means that, in the sector of large k,\nthese two states have coherent phases and therefore a\nconstructive interference. Since each of them has an infinite norm, their scalar product diverges. A similar effect can be found in the quantum dynamics of a free\nparticle with an energy given by a function E(k) with\ndE(k)/dk \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e.

(19) can be written explicitly as a\nconvergent series (when R1 6= R2 ) by expanding the sine\nfunction as a power series of e\u22124\u1e20k and computing the\nresulting integrals involving two Bessel functions and an\nexponential [21]\nh0| [\u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )] |0i =\n(\n\u221e\nX\ni8\u1e20\n(\u22121)n (\u2206t)2n\n\u221a\nsin(\u2206t)\nQ\u22121/2 [\u03c32n (R1 , R2 )]\n(2n)!\n\u03c0 R1 R2\nn=0\n)\n\u221e\nX\n(\u22121)n (\u2206t)2n+1\nQ\u22121/2 [\u03c32n+1 (R1 , R2 )] .

We choose t2 \u2212 t1\nsmall enough to guarantee the rapid convergence of the\nseries in Eq. (20) and leave a discussion of the behavior of the integral (19) when \u1e20 \u2192 0 for future work.\nAs we can see h0| [\u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )] |0i seems to approach [\u03c8\u0302(R1 , T1 = t1 ), \u03c8\u0302(R2 , T2 = t2 )] at least in a certain average sense when \u1e20 is sufficiently small (though\nnot vanishing). It falls off to zero quite quickly outside\nthe light cone defined by the free commutator and the\nauxiliary Minkowski metric, and displays an oscillatory\nbehavior within this light cone. The characteristic length\nof this oscillation decreases with \u1e20, as well as close to\nthe R1 = R2 singularity. The approximation obtained\nby truncating the series expansion (20), keeping a sufficiently large number of terms, compares well with the\nresults of numerically computing expression (19), at least\nfor low enough values of t2 \u2212 t1 .\n\u2022 Expectation value on one-particle states.\nWe consider now states of the form\nZ \u221e\ndk f (k)A\u2020 (k)|0i\n|\u03c1i =\n0\n\nwhere the function f = |f |ei\u03c6f satisfies\nWe then have\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\ndk|f (k)|2 = 1.\n\nh\u03c1|[\u03c8\u0302E (R1 , t1 ), \u03c8\u0302E (R2 , t2 )]|\u03c1i =\n\u001a\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u2212i8\u1e20 dk1 dk2 J0 (R1 k1 ) 2J0 (R2 k2 )|f (k1 )f (k2 )|\n0\n\u00020\n\u0003\n\u00d7 sin 2\u1e20(t1 \u2212 t2 )E(k1 )E(k2 ) cos [\u03a9f (k1 , k2 )]\ni\u001b\nh\n\u2212J0 (R2 k1 )|f (k2 )|2 sin (t2 \u2212 t1 )E(k1 )e\u22124\u1e20k2 , (21)\nwhere\n\u03a9f (k1 , k2 ) = 2\u1e20(t2 \u2212 t1 )E(k1 )E(k2 ) + t1 E(k1 )\n\u2212 t2 E(k2 ) \u2212 \u03c6f (k1 ) + \u03c6f (k2 ).\nA complete discussion of the meaning of the previous\nexpression is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, some features already present in the vacuum expectation value are also present here; in particular the\n\nR1 = R2 singularity. This can be seen by considering the\nlast term in Eq. (21): the integral in k2 is\nZ \u221e\ni\nh\ndk2 |f (k2 )|2 sin (t2 \u2212 t1 )E(k1 )e\u22124\u1e20k2 ,\n0\n\nwhich takes in general a non-vanishing constant value\n(depending on t2 \u2212 t1 and \u1e20) as k1 \u2192 \u221e, thus rendering\nthe remaining integral in k1 divergent. As the first term\nin Eq. (21) leads to a convergent integral, we conclude\nthat the expectation value is singular when R1 = R2 .\nIt is not difficult to obtain as well an explicit expression for the expectation value of the E(H0 )-commutator\non the coherent states of the field \u03c8. These diagonal\nmatrix elements are calculated in Appendix B. For our\ndiscussion in this work, let us only comment that the result is actually divergent when R1 = R2 . This supplies\nfurther support to the claim that the considered singularity is indeed a generic feature of the system.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nLinearly polarized cylindrical waves can be studied in\ngreat detail both from the classical and quantum points\nof view. As we have seen, there are two relevant Hamiltonians for the study of the system. We have shown that\nthe action and the metric of the gauge-fixed model in\nlinearized gravity reproduce the results obtained by considering full cylindrical gravity and working to the first\nperturbative order. We get in this way a free Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the\nfull system, on the other hand, is different from the free\none, but turns out to be a function of it and presents certain features with deep physical consequences, like e.g.\nthe existence of an upper bound.\nWe have studied the similarities and differences of\nthese two admissible kinds of evolution; in particular,\nwe have discussed how the emergence of an upper bound\nfor the energy affects the causal structure of the model\nand the spreading of the light cones. The field commutator for the free Hamiltonian is a c-number and shows\nthe typical light cone structure found in standard perturbative quantum field theories. The commutator for\nthe physical Hamiltonian, as it usually happens for interacting theories, is no longer a c-number, so one has\nto consider its matrix elements. By concentrating on the\nvacuum expectation value we have been able to see several interesting phenomena: a spreading of the light cone\nas a function of the gravitational constant, the disappearance of the singularity present in the free case due to the\nsmearing of the symmetry axis and the appearance of a\nnew type of singularity associated with the fact that the\nenergy is bounded from above. This new singularity is\nalso present in the other expectation values discussed in\nthe paper, namely for one-particle states and coherent\nstates, and appears to be a generic feature of the model.\nThere are several open questions that we plan to address in future work. In particular, it would be desirable\n\n\f11\nto reach a better understanding of the behavior of the\nfield commutator in the limit in which the length scale\nprovided by \u1e20 goes to zero. The expectation values of\nthe E(H0 )-commutator discussed here resemble those derived from the free Hamiltonian H0 at least in a certain\naverage sense. However it is not obvious how precisely\nand up to what extent they actually relate to each other.\nThis is partly so because of the different singularity structure found in both cases. Further research on this subject will concentrate on the properties of the model in the\nsemiclassical limit \u1e20 \u2192 0. We will also pay detailed attention to matrix elements of the field commutator other\nthan the vacuum expectation value, with the aim at discussing how the smearing of the light cones depends on\n\nthe energy.\n\nAPPENDIX A: USEFUL COMMUTATORS\n\nIn this appendix, we compute the commutators of\nthe creation and annihilation operators \u00c2E (k, t) and\n\u00c2\u2020E (k, t), obtained from the corresponding operators\n\u00c2(k) and \u00c2\u2020 (k) via Rthe unitary evolution generated by\n\u221e\nE(\u01240 ), where \u01240 = 0 dkk \u00c2\u2020 (k)\u00c2(k).
