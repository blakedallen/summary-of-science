INTRODUCTION\n\nLast decade, a possibility of a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior in two-dimensional (2D)\nsystems has been a subject of many theoretical investigations. This question is especially\ninteresting in connection with the high-temperature superconductors where many unconventional features, including pseudogap phenomena, are observed. Anderson [1] has put forward\nthe idea that a 2D system can demonstrate NFL behavior at arbitrary small interelectron\nrepulsion U owing to a finite phase shift at the Fermi energy. Even in the absence of such\neffects, a NFL state can occur at small U because of peculiarities of electron or spin and\ncharge fluctuation spectra.\nIn the usual 2D Fermi liquid the imaginary part of the self-energy (electron damping)\nhas the energy dependence Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d \u03b52 ln |\u03b5| [2,3], and the temperature behavior of\nresistivity is \u03c1 \u221d T 2 ln T [4]. However, these dependences do not describe experimental data\non high-Tc cooper-oxide compounds. To treat the anomalous behavior of these systems,\nVarma et al [5] proposed the phenomenological marginal Fermi-liquid (MFL) theory where\nIm\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d |\u03b5|. Then the electronic specific heat should demonstrate T ln T -dependence,\nand the resistivity the T -linear behavior. A similar behavior in a broad temperature region\ncan be obtained in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations for 2D and nested\n3D systems [6,7]. The linear energy dependence of the self-energy was also obtained within\nthe spin-fermion theory [8,9] which supposes that the magnetic correlation length of the\nsystem is large enough.\nAnother explanation of anomalous electron properties of 2D lattice systems can be found\nin the presence of the van Hove (VH) singularities [10]. In this case, the bare electron density\nof states is logarithmically divergent and to leading (second) order in U we have the behavior\nIm\u03a3(kV H , \u03b5) \u221d |\u03b5| ln |1/\u03b5| at |\u03b5| \u226b |\u03bc| (kV H is assumed to be VH point), which differs slightly\nfrom the linear dependence in the MFL theory. However, the important question occurs how\nthis behavior changes with taking into account higher-order terms. RPA calculations [11],\nnumerical calculations within the FLEX approximation [12] and analytical analysis [12] show\n2\n\n\fthat not too close to van Hove filling the (quasi-) linear energy dependence of the self-energy\ntakes place in a broad range of the energies.\nWithin the renormalization-group approach, the behavior of the self-energy was discussed\nin Refs. [13,14]. The conclusions of different approaches turned out to be contradictory: a\npossibility of a NFL state is discussed in Ref. [13], while a standard Fermi-liquid behavior\nwas found in Ref. [14]. It should be noted that in both the papers only part of all the\npossible interaction channels was taken into account. However, as it was discussed in Refs.\n[15,16], all the scattering channels are equally important, which can substantially change\nthe previous results.\nIn the present paper we consider the energy-dependence of the self-energy with account\nof all the scattering channels. We demonstrate that a violation of the Fermi-liquid picture\ntakes place provided that the system is close to quantum phase transition into a magnetically\nordered or superconducting state. Our approach can be considered as a generalization of\nthat of Ref. [17] to the case of a non-nested Fermi surface. Note that our RG analysis takes\ninto account the contribution of the vicinity of VH points only. For fillings close to VH\none, this contribution is most singular and vertices with the corresponding momenta are\nmost divergent. This can be checked by analysis of the results of complete RG approach\nwhich takes into account the contribution of entire Fermi surface [18]. Unlike this approach,\nhowever, present approach gives the possibility to take into account all channels of electron\nscattering, as discussed in details in Ref. [15]. Recent analysis [16] which permits to consider\nthe interplay of different channels gives the results close to that obtained earliar within twopatch and parquet equations approach [15]. Thus we can expect that the approach based on\nconsideration of the vicinities of VH singularities is reliable and gives qualitatively correct\nresults for fillings close to VH one. The behavior of some physical properties and application\nof the results obtained to cuprates is discussed in the Conclusion.\n\n3\n\n\fII. THE MODEL AND QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITIONS\n\nWe consider the t-t\u2032 Hubbard model on the square lattice:\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u03b5k c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + U\n\nX\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nk\n\nwith the electron spectrum\n\u03b5k = \u22122t(cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 4t\u2032 (cos kx cos ky + 1) \u2212 \u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nHereafter we assume t > 0, t\u2032 < 0 (which is the case for hole-doped systems), 0 \u2264 |t\u2032 /t| < 1/2.\nFor t\u2032 = 0 the Fermi surface is nested, which results in peculiarities of physical properties\n[17,7]. However, nesting is removed for t\u2032 /t 6= 0. For arbitrary t\u2032 /t, the spectrum (2) contains\nVH singularities connected with the points A = (\u03c0, 0), B = (0, \u03c0). The chemical potential\n\u03bc is determined by the electron concentration n and can be obtained from the condition\nn=\n\nX\n\nfk\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nwith fk = f (\u03b5k ) being the Fermi function, so that \u03bc = 0 corresponds to Van Hove filling.\nBeing expanded near the VH singularity points, the spectrum (2) takes the form\n2\n\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b5A\nk = \u22122t(sin \u03c6k x \u2212 cos \u03c6ky ) \u2212 \u03bc\n2\n\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b5B\nk = 2t(cos \u03c6kx \u2212 sin \u03c6k y ) \u2212 \u03bc\n\n(4a)\n(4b)\n\nwhere k x = \u03c0 \u2212 kx , k y = \u03c0 \u2212 ky , \u03c6 is the half of the angle between asymptotes at VH\nsingularity, 2\u03c6 = cos\u22121 (\u22122t\u2032 /t).\nWe have a set of quantum phase transitions (QPT's) for the model (1), see Ref. [15].\nWe restrict ourselves to the case of small enough U . 6t, so that we may neglect the\ncorrelation effects connected with Hubbard's subband formation (e.g., the Mott-Hubbard\nmetal-insulator transition). Provided that the electron concentration is not too close to its\nvan Hove value, i.e. the chemical potential satisfies |\u03bc| > \u03bcc , \u03bcc being the critical value, we\nhave the normal (paramagnetic and non-superconducting) phase. When approaching the\n4\n\n\fVH singularity, a QPT to antiferromagnetic, superconducting or ferromagnetic state occurs.\nThe type of the ground state depends on t\u2032 /t and U. In particular, for U = 4t we have the\nantiferromagnetic ground state at |t\u2032 /t| < 0.30 and ferromagnetic one for larger |t\u2032 /t| [15].\nThe critical electron concentrations for stability of these phases differ by several percents\nfrom van Hove filling.\n\nIII. ELECTRON SELF-ENERGY IN THE SECOND ORDER\n\nConsider first zero-temperature perturbative results. To second order the expression for\nthe electron self-energy has the form\n\u03a3(2) (k, \u03b5) = U 2\n\nX fp+q\u2212k (1 \u2212 fp \u2212 fq ) + fp fq\n\u03b5 + \u03b5p+q\u2212k \u2212 \u03b5p \u2212 \u03b5q\n\npq\n\n(5)\n\nThis contribution can be represented as a sum of three diagrams (Fig.2 a-c):\n\u03a3(2) (k, \u03b5) = \u03a31 (k, \u03b5) + \u03a32 (k, \u03b5) + \u03a33 (k, \u03b5)\n\n(6)\n\nB\nWhen picking out the singularities we can put \u03b5p = \u03b5A\np or \u03b5p = \u03b5p for p being close to A(B)\n\nvan Hove points. Note that the term \u03a31 was investigated earlier [13,14,22]. We restrict our\nconsideration to the VH points at the Fermi surface, kF = (0, \u03c0) or (\u03c0, 0).

(8), respectively,\n\u03b8(\u03b5) is the step function. At t\u2032 /t 6= 0 we have Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) 6= Im\u03a3(kF , \u2212\u03b5) because of the\nabsence of the particle-hole symmetry for the less singular terms \u03a32,3 (kF , \u03b5). This fact\nresults in an asymmetry of the electron density of states near the Fermi level and can be\nimportant for some physical properties, e.g., thermoelectric power. Unlike the real part of\nthe self-energy, the imaginary part changes its dependence to quadratic one at |\u03b5| \u226a |\u03bc|\ndemonstrating a conventional Fermi-liquid behavior in this region.\n\nIV. RENORMALIZATION\n\nBoth real and imaginary parts of the self-energy contain large logarithms at |\u03bc| \u226a |\u03b5| \u226a t.\nTherefore we can introduce the logarithmic variable \u03bb = ln(\u039b|t/\u03b5|1/2). Then the leading\nterms of the expansion in the powers of interaction strength can be written down as\n6\n\n\f\u03a3(\u03bb) = A\u03bbg02\u03b5(1 + C1 g0 \u03bb + D1 g02\u03bb + ...)\nTo perform the summation of leading logarithms in the self-energy, we introduce the vertices\n\u03b3i (\u03bb), i = 1, ...4 (Fig. 2), and consider the renormalization of \u03a3. As discussed in Refs.\n[23,24,15], \u03b3i (\u03bb) can be determined from the renormalization-group (RG) equations\n\u03b31\u2032 = 2d1 (\u03bb)\u03b31 (\u03b32 \u2212 \u03b31 ) + 2d2\u03b31 \u03b34 \u2212 2 d3 \u03b31 \u03b32\n\u03b32\u2032 = d1 (\u03bb)(\u03b322 + \u03b332 ) + 2d2 (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32 )\u03b34 \u2212 d3 (\u03b312 + \u03b322 )\n\u03b33\u2032 = \u22122d0 (\u03bb)\u03b33 \u03b34 + 2d1 (\u03bb)\u03b33 (2\u03b32 \u2212 \u03b31 )\n\u03b34\u2032 = \u2212d0 (\u03bb)(\u03b332 + \u03b342 ) + d2 (\u03b312 + 2\u03b31 \u03b32 \u2212 2\u03b322 + \u03b342 )\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b3i\u2032 \u2261 d\u03b3i /d\u03bb,\nd0 (\u03bb) = 2c0 \u03bb;\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03bb, \u03bb < 2zQ\nd1 (\u03bb) = 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 zQ , \u03bb > 2zQ\nd2 = 2z0 ; d3 = 2cQ\n\n(11)\n\nThe quantities\n\u221a\nz0 = c0 = 1/ sin(2\u03c6) = 1/ 1 \u2212 R2\nare the prelogarithmic factors in small-momentum particle-hole and particle-particle bubble,\nwhile\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 R2 )/R]\n\u221a\ncQ = tan\u22121 (R/ 1 \u2212 R2 )/R\n\nzQ = ln[(1 +\n\n(12)\n\nare the prelogarithmic factors in particle-hole and particle-particle bubble with momenta\nclose to Q = (\u03c0,\u03c0), R = \u22122t\u2032 /t. Equations (10) should be solved with the initial condition\n\u03b3i (0) = g0 . Because of the presence of double-logarithmic terms, the corresponding RG\nequations are only approximate. However, the comparison of the results of their solution\n7\n\n\f[15] with the parquet approach [15] and the RG approach which takes into account the contribution of the whole Fermi-surface [16] shows that they reproduce well the renormalization\nof the couplings.\nThe magnetic or superconducting instabilities manifest in the divergence of the vertices\n\u03b3i (\u03bb) at some critical scale \u03bbc . This is connected with the critical energy scales discussed in\nSect. II as \u03bcc \u223c Tc \u223c \u039b exp(\u22122\u03bbc ), for a detailed discussion see Ref. [15]. (In the absence\nof interlayer coupling the quantity Tc has the meaning of a temperature of crossover into\nthe state with pronounced short-range order (or pseudogap state) rather than of a phase\ntransition temperature.) For \u03bb close to \u03bbc the solution of the Eqs. (10) can be represented\nin the form\n\u03b3i =\n\n\u03b3ic\n\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb\n\n(13)\n\nThe corresponding correlation length is given by\n\u03be \u22122 = C\u03be |\u03bc|(\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb)/t\n\n(14)\n\nwhere C\u03be is the universal number. For T \u226a |\u03bc| we should stop the scaling at\n\u03bb\u2217 = ln[\u039bt1/2 / max(|\u03bc|, |\u03b5|)1/2]\n\n(15)\n\n\u03bb\u2217 = ln[\u039bt1/2 / max(T, |\u03b5|)1/2 ]\n\n(16)\n\nwhile T \u226b |\u03bc| at\n\nThe condition |\u03bc| > \u03bcc or T > Tc guarantees that \u03bb\u2217 < \u03bbc , i.e. the system is not ordered\nand RG approach is applicable.\nNow we consider the renormalization of the self-energy. We follow the method of Refs.\n[25\u201327]. Defining the scale-dependent quasiparticle residue\nZ(\u03bb) = Z1 (\u03bb)Z2 (\u03bb)Z3 (\u03bb)\nwhere Zi (i = 1, 2, 3) is the contribution of i-th diagram, we have the RG equations\n8\n\n\fd ln Z1 (\u03bb)\n= \u2212(8 ln 2)\u03bb\u03b342 / sin2 2\u03c6\nd\u03bb\nd ln Z2 (\u03bb)\n= \u2212D2 (\u03bb)(\u03b312 + \u03b322 \u2212 \u03b31 \u03b32 )/ sin2 2\u03c6\nd\u03bb\nd ln Z3 (\u03bb)\n= \u2212D3 (\u03bb)\u03b332 / sin2 2\u03c6\nd\u03bb\n\n(17)\n\nHere\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 4k2,3 \u03bb ln 2 \u03bb < (1/2) ln(1/ cos 2\u03c6)\nD2,3 (\u03bb) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 A2,3\n\u03bb > (1/2) ln(1/ cos 2\u03c6)\n\nand the summation over spin indices in vertices is performed. Then the real part of the\nself-energy can be found as\nRe\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) = \u03b5 ln Z(\u03bb\u2217 )\n\n(18)\n\n(see, e.g., Ref. [27]). After calculating Re\u03a3, the imaginary part of the self-energy can be\nobtained from the Kramers-Kronig relations.\n\nV. RESULTS OF CALCULATIONS\n\nFirst, we demonstrate our approach in a simple case with the only non-zero vertex,\n\u03b34 6= 0. As discussed in Ref. [15], this case corresponds to t\u2032 \u2192 \u2212t/2, the ground state at\nvan Hove filling being ferromagnetic (flat-band ferromagnetism). Then we have\n\u03b34 =\n\ng0\n1 + g0 (c0 \u03bb2 \u2212 2z0 \u03bb)\n\n(19)\n\nThe vertex (19) diverges in the critical point\n\u03bbc =\n\np\n1\n\u039b2 t\nln\n= 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1/(z0 g0 )\n2 max(\u03bc, T )\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we have put z0 = c0 in \u03bbc according to (12). From (17) we obtain Z2 = Z3 = 1 and\ng02\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1)\n4 ln 2\nZ1 = exp \u2212 2\nsin 2\u03c6 (1 \u2212 g 0 z0 ) (1 + g 0 z0 \u03bb2 \u2212 2g0 z0 \u03bb)\n\u0014\n\nFor \u03bb being close to \u03bbc we have\n9\n\n\u0015\n\n(21)\n\n\f\u03b34 \u223c \u03be 2 (T = 0) \u223c (\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121\n\n(22)\n\nAs well as in the nesting case (see, e.g., Ref. [17]), the quasiparticle weight Z vanishes\nexponentially in the QPT point. Note that this vanishing is much faster than the inverselogarithmic dependence\nZ\u223c\n\n1\n, q \u2243 0.35\nln (\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb)\nq\n\n(23)\n\nobtained in Ref. [13] where only one scattering channel was taken into account. Besides\nnearly-linear dependences in \u03b5 (with logarithmic corrections), both real and imaginary part\nof the self-energy contain large \u03b5-dependent factors of the order of 1/(\u03bbc \u2212\u03bb)2 \u221d \u03be 4 (0), which\noccur because of the divergence of the vertex (19) at \u03bb \u2192 \u03bbc .\nAs discussed in Ref. [15], for |t\u2032 /t| being not very close to 1/2 we have an interplay of\nall the scattering channels, so that we have to solve Eqs. (10), (17) numerically. We also\ncalculate the quasiparticle spectral weight in VH points of the Fermi surface,\nA(kV H , \u03b5) = \u2212\n\n1\nIm\u03a3(kV H , \u03b5)\n\u03c0 [\u03b5 + \u03bc \u2212 Re\u03a3(kV H , \u03b5)]2 + [Im\u03a3(kV H , \u03b5)]2\n\n(24)\n\nThe results of the calculations for t\u2032 = \u22120.45t, \u03bc/t = 0.3, T = 0 (nearly ferromagnetic\nground state, \u03bcc /t = 0.04) are shown in Fig. 3. As well as in the second order of the\nperturbation theory, at |\u03b5| \u226a |\u03bc| we have the 2D behavior of self-energy\nRe\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d \u03b5, Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d \u03b52 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhile |\u03bc| \u226a |\u03b5| \u226a t it changes to van Hove behavior,\nRe\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d \u03b5 ln2 (\u039bt/\u03b5), Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d |\u03b5| ln(\u039bt/\u03b5)\n\n(26)\n\nFinally, at \u03b5 = \u03b50 \u223c t the real part of self-energy has a maximum and then decreases with\nfarther increasing of \u03b5, while imaginary part is almost a constant at \u03b5 \u223c t. The slope of RG\nresults in the region |\u03bc| \u226a |\u03b5| \u226a t is substantially higher that the results of the second-order\nperturbation theory, the imaginary part of the self-energy at |\u03b5| \u2265 |\u03bc| also becomes large\nenough. The peak in the quasiparticle weight obtained within RG approach is more broad\n10\n\n\fthan in the second-order perturbation theory, which is the consequence of larger electron\ndamping in the letter case. With the increasing the chemical potential (so that the system is\nmoved away from QPT), the higher-order renormalizations become less important and the\nbehavior of the self-energy reproduces the result of the second-order perturbation theory.\nThe imaginary part of self-energy at finite temperature and \u03b5 = 0 (the inverse quasiparticle lifetime at the Fermi surface) can be obtained from the scaling arguments,\n\u03b3(T ) = \u2212[Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5)|T =0]\u03b5\u2192T\n\n(27)\n\nThus it is given by the same Figs. 3b with the replacement \u03b5 \u2192 T and also demonstrates\nthe linear behavior in some temperature region.\nIn the above consideration we neglected completely the damping of the particle-particle\nand particle-hole excitations as well as other non-singular contributions. These non-singular\nterms can be neglected provided that the condition\n\u03be \u22122 \u226b max(|\u03bc|, |\u03b5|)/t\n\n(28)\n\nis satisfied, i.e. not too close to quantum phase transition into the corresponding ordered\nstate and at not too high energies. Close to the quantum phase transition into the ordered\nstate, the peaks in the self-energy should become asymmetric, as discussed in Ref. [11], and\nthe pseudogap can be formed. On the other hand, in the limit of large enough |\u03bc|, i.e. at\nmax(|\u03b5|/t, \u03be \u22122) \u226a |\u03bc|/t\n\n(29)\n\nthe spin-fermion theory [9] is applicable.\n\nVI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present paper we have investigated within a scaling approach the energy dependence of the real and imaginary part of the electron self-energy in the presence of van Hove\nsingularities. We have restricted ourselves to the regions of the \u03bc \u2212 T phase diagram, where\nthe Fermi level is not too close to VH points (disordered ground state, \u03bcc < |\u03bc| \u226a t with\n11\n\n\f\u03bcc is the critical chemical potential) or temperature is above the critical value (T > Tc with\nTc \u223c \u03bcc ).\nProvided the system is not too close to QPT (at \u03bcc < |\u03bc| \u226a t), the imaginary part\nof the self-energy at VH points demonstrates in a broad energy region |\u03bc| \u226a |\u03b5| \u226a t a\nnearly-linear behavior, Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) \u221d |\u03b5| ln(t/|\u03b5|), which is close to that in the marginal\nFermi-liquid concept [5] (however, in MFL the linear behavior of Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) takes place for\narbitrary kF ). The real part of the self-energy behaves as \u03b5 ln2 (t/|\u03b5|). The linear energy\ndependence of the self-energy (26) and the behaviour of the slope with changing \u03bc are in\nagreement with the RG results of Ref. [19] which takes into account of the contribution of\nthe whole Fermi-surface. These dependences are also similar to those obtained within the\nspin-fermion model for a nearly antiferromagnetic state [8,9], although in our case they have\na different nature and are governed by van Hove singularities themselves rather than by\ncloseness to antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition. The role of a characteristic spinfluctuation frequency \u03c9sf , which separates the Fermi-liquid and MFL regimes, belongs in\nour case to the chemical potential |\u03bc| (\u03bc = 0 corresponds to VH filling). Another difference\nis that in the presence of VH singularities the linear dependence of self-energy takes place\nalready in the weak-coupling regime.\nNear QPT, the renormalizations become important because of the large ground-state\ncorrelation length which enters renormalized vertices. Therefore both real and imaginary\nparts of the self-energy increase considerably as \u03be 2 (T = 0). Such an anomalous behavior also\nimplies a strong violation of the Fermi-liquid and even MFL picture. Note that the anomalies\nunder consideration may induce the electron topological transition with the truncation of\nthe Fermi surface (see, e.g. Ref. [28]). The RG approach used is not able to describe the\nmagnetically ordered or superconducting state. By this reason, the renormalized-classical\nregime T < Tc , |\u03bc| < \u03bcc should be considered within other approaches, see, e.g., Ref. [29].\nIn 2D situation, the physical properities near QPT should demonstrate singularities\nwhich are stronger than those in the 3D case. The correction to the electron density of\nstates N(\u03b5) reads\n12\n\n\f\u03b4N(\u03b5) = \u2212\n\nX\u0014\nk\u03c3\n\n1\nRe\u03a3(k,\u03b5)\u03b4 (\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5k ) + Im\u03a3(k,\u03b5)/(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5k )2\n\u03c0\n\u2032\n\n\u0015\n\n(30)\n\nMain contribution to the integral comes from the vicinity of VH points where the bare\ndensity of states is logarithmically divergent. Taking into account that Re\u03a3(2) (k, \u03b5) \u221d\n\u03b5 ln2 max{|\u03b5|, |\u03b5k|}, we obtain for the first (coherent) term in the square brackets which\noriginates from renormalization of quasiparticle spectrum\n\u03b4Ncoh (\u03b5) \u221d ln3 (t/|\u03b5|), \u03b5 \u226b \u03bc.\n\n(31)\n\nThe calculation of the second (incoherent, non-quasiparticle) term requires the full form of\n\u03a3(2) (k,\u03b5), Eq.(5), and leads to the result\n\u03b4Nincoh (\u03b5) \u221d ln2 (t/|\u03b5 + \u03bc|).\n\n(32)\n\nAlthough this divergence is slightly weaker than of the coherent term, it is not cut at\n\u03b5 = \u2212\u03bc. Thereby the bare VH singularity becomes considerably enhanced. Note that the\ndivergence of the density of states together with its asymmetry in \u03b5 may lead to peculiarities\nof thermoelectric power owing to impurity scattering, cf. Ref. [7].\nTo leading (second) order the contribution to electronic specific heat owing to VH singularities has the form \u03b4C \u221d T ln3 (t/ max{|\u03bc|, T }). The resistivity (inverse transport relaxation time) should demonstrate at T > \u03bc the behavior \u03c1 \u221d T ln2 (t/T ). The calculations are\nsimilar to those of Ref. [7] for the antiferromagnetic state, extra logarithmic factors coming\nfrom VH singularities. The crossover from quadratic to nearly linear temperature dependence of resistivity is confirmed by experimental data for cuprates (see, e.g., the results of\nRef. [30] for the LaSrCuO system).\nThus the divergences in the many-electron system with VH singularities are stronger\nthan those in the MFL theory. Near QPT, we can expect that all the physical properties\nare strongly renormalized, the renormalizations being dependent on the type of the ordered\nphase. This problem will be considered elsewhere.\nFinally we consider the application of the results obtained to cuprate systems. A nearly\nlinear energy dependence of Im\u03a3(kF , \u03b5) at VH points, which is similar to our results, was\n13\n\n\fobserved for the system Bi2212 in ARPES experiments [31]. For the system La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\nwith the doping xc \u2243 0.2 (which is slightly larger than the optimal one) the Fermi surface\ncrosses VH points [32]. The density of states [33], specific heat coefficient and Pauli susceptibility [34] substantially grow near this doping. The mass enhancement factor m\u2217 /m\ndemonstrates a similar behavior. The additional experimental investigations of the selfenergy near (\u03c0, 0) point of La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 would be interesting in this respect.\n\nVII.
