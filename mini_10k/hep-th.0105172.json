When the vacuum expectation of the energy momentum tensor\nis zero, but the scalar current or pseudoscalar current gets an expectation,\nevaluation of the gravitino self energy using the supersymmetry current algebra shows that there is an induced gravitino mass term. The structure of\nthis term generalizes the supergravity action with cosmological constant to\ntheories with CP violation. When the vacuum expectation of the energy momentum tensor is nonzero, supersymmetry is broken; requiring cancellation\nof the cosmological constant gives the corresponding generalized gravitino\nmass formula.\n\n2\n\n\fSupersymmetry, to be relevant to physics, must be broken, and mechanisms for supersymmetry breaking have been intensively studied. In this essay, we shall analyze scenarios\nfor spontaneous symmetry breaking in locally supersymmetric theories by reference to the\nvacuum expectation values of the components of the current supermultiplet, through which\na generic supersymmetric matter theory couples to linearized supergravity.\nIn linearized general relativity, the spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd deviates from the Minkowski\nmetric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd by a small perturbation h\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + 2\u03bah\u03bc\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the proportionality constant \u03ba related to Newton's constant G and the Planck mass\nMPlanck by\n1\n\n\u22121\n\u03ba = (8\u03c0G) 2 = MPlanck\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nIn linearized supergravity, one adjoins to the spin 2 graviton field h\u03bc\u03bd a spin 3/2 RaritaSchwinger Majorana field \u03c8\u03bc , which describes the fermionic gravitino partner of the graviton.\nA gravity supermultiplet, for which the supersymmetry algebra closes without use of the\nequations of motion, is obtained by adding auxiliary fields, consisting [1] of an axial vector\nb\u03bc , a scalar M, and a pseudoscalar N.

(8) is invariant under\nthe supersymmetry transformation on the current supermultiplet given in Eq. (5).\nTo examine the implications of the above relations for spontaneous symmetry breaking, we take vacuum expectations (denoted by h\n\ni) of Eqs. (5) and (7). Because Lorentz\n(5)\n\ninvariance requires the vanishing of the vacuum expectations hj\u03bc i, hj\u03bc i, and hb\u03bc i, while\nh\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i can be proportional to the Minkowski metric \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , and so can be nonzero, Eq. (5) gives\nh\u03b4\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i =h\u03b4j\u03bc(5) i = h\u03b4P i = h\u03b4Qi = 0 ,\n1\nh\u03b4j\u03bc i =[2\u03b3 h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd (hP i + i\u03b35 hQi)]\u01eb ,\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\u03bd\n\nand Eq. (7) gives\n1\n1\nhMi = \u2212 \u03bahP i , hNi = \u2212 \u03bahQi .\n4\n4\n\n(11)\n\nSince hP i, hQi are coordinate independent by translation invariance, they do not contribute\nto the right hand side of Eq. (10). Hence Eq. (10) for h\u03b4j\u03bc i simplifies to\nh\u03b4j\u03bc i = 2\u03b3 \u03bd h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i\u01eb .\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fLet us first consider the case when h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i = 0. The set of expectations\nh\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i =hj\u03bc i = hj\u03bc(5) i = 0 ,\nhP i =\n6 0,\n\n(13)\n\nhQi =\n6 0 ,\n\nsatisfy Eqs. (10) if we take the supersymmetry variations of the expectations to be \u03b4hP i =\nh\u03b4P i = 0, \u03b4hQi = h\u03b4Qi = 0. Thus, the transformation properties of the supermultiplet of\ncurrents are preserved when the scalar current P and the pseudoscalar current Q develop\nnonzero vacuum expectations that are supersymmetry invariants.\nWhether P and/or Q have nonzero expectations is a matter of detailed dynamics. An\nimportant case where hP i =\n6 0, but supersymmetry remains unbroken, is supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory. In this theory P is related to the gaugino density through the scalar\ncomponent of the anomaly supermultiplet,\nP = g \u22121 \u03b2(g)\u03c7\u03c7 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwith g the Yang-Mills coupling, and hence P develops a nonzero expectation,\nhP i = g \u22121 \u03b2(g)h\u03c7\u03c7i ,\n\n(15)\n\nas a result of the formation [4] of a vacuum gaugino condensate.\nWhen P and/or Q has a nonzero expectation, Eq. (8) implies a nonzero vacuum\nenergy density (the negative of the vacuum action density) given by\n\u03c1VAC = \u2212\n\n\u03ba2\n(hP i2 + hQi2 ) .\n48\n\n(16)\n\nThere are two other places where effects arising from hP i and hQi appear. First, from\nEqs. (3) and (11), we see that the supersymmetry variation of the gravitino field receives a\ncontribution from hP i and hQi given by\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03bc =\n\n\u03ba\n\u03b3\u03bc (hP i + i\u03b35 hQi)\u01eb + ... ,\n12\n6\n\n(17)\n\n\fwith ... denoting terms with expectation zero.\nSecond, hP i and hQi contribute to the gravitino self energy. To order \u03ba2 , the gravitino\nself energy induced by matter couplings is given by the action addition\n\u03ba2\n\u2206S = i\n8\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\nd4 xd4 y\u03c8\u03bcA (x)hT (jA\u03bc (x)j B (y))i\u03c8\u03c1B (y) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwith A, B spinor indices. The action term involving no derivatives of the gravitino field is\nobtained by treating the gravitino field as a constant in Eq. (18), leading to\n\u03ba2\n\u2206S \u2243 i\n8\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\ni\u03c8\u03c1B (x) ,\nd4 x\u03c8 \u03bcA (x)hKAB\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\nwith the constant operator KAB\ndefined by\nR 4 R 4\n\u03c1\nd x d yT (jA\u03bc (x)j B (y))\n\u03bc\u03c1\nR\nKAB \u2261\nd4 x 1\n\n(19)\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\nTo evaluate KAB\n, we use current algebra methods, by expanding the identity\n\n0=\n\nZ\n\nd4 xd4 y\n\n\u2202 \u03bc\n\u03c1\n[x T (jA\u03b8 (x)j B (y))] ,\nx\u03b8\n\n(21)\n\ngiving\n\u03bc\u03c1\nKAB\n\nR\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u2212 d4 xd4 yx\u03bc [T (\u2202 * jA (x)j B (y)) + \u03b4(x0 \u2212 y 0 ){jA0 (x), j B (y)}]\nR\n=\nd4 x 1\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nUsing conservation of jA\u03b8 , together with the fact that jA0 is the supersymmetry generator\nobeying\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u01ebA {jA0 (x), j B (y)} = \u2212i\u03b4 3 (~x \u2212 ~y )\u03b4j B (y) ,\n\n(23)\n\nand using Eq. (5) to calculate the supersymmetry variation on the right hand side of Eq. (23),\nwe get\n\u03bc\u03c1\nKAB\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\nR\n\nd4 xd4 yx\u03bc \u03b4 4 (x \u2212 y)\n\ni \u03bc\u03c1\n= \u2212 \u03c3AB\n3\n\nR\n\n\u2212i\n3\n\nR\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c4\u03c1 \u2202\n\u03c3AB\n[P (y) + i\u03b35 Q(y)] + ...\ny\u03c4\n\nd4 x 1\n\nd4 x[P (x) + i\u03b35 Q(x)] + ...\nR\nd4 x 1\n7\n\n(24)\n.\n\n\fThe terms denoted by ... do not contribute to the expectation, and so Eq. (24) implies\ni \u03bc\u03c1\n\u03bc\u03c1\nhKAB\ni = \u2212 \u03c3AB\n(hP i + i\u03b35 hQi) ,\n3\n\n(25)\n\nwhich when substituted into Eq. (19) gives the gravitino mass term\n\u2206Smass\n\n\u03ba2\n=\n24\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\u03c8 \u03bc (x)(hP i + i\u03b35 hQi)\u03c3 \u03bc\u03c1 \u03c8\u03c1 (x) .\n\n(26)\n\nWhen the CP violating expectation hQi is zero, Eqs. (16), (17), and (26) are respectively the\nvacuum energy density, the modified gravitino variation, and the gravitino mass term that\nenter into the extension [5] of supergravity to accommodate a nonvanishing cosmological\nconstant, corresponding to supergravity in anti-de Sitter space [6]. When the expectation\nhQi is nonzero, these equations give a generalized supergravity with cosmological constant,\nin which there is also a CP violating gravitino mass term.\nThis generalized supergravity is supersymmetric even beyond the linearized approximation. To see this, we make the polar decomposition\n1\n\nhP i + i\u03b35 hQi = (hP i2 + hQi2 ) 2 ei\u03b1\u03b35 ,\n\n\u03b1 = arctan(hQi/hP i) .\n\n(27)\n\nand define new gamma matrices \u03b3\u0303\u03bc = \u03b3\u03bc exp(i\u03b1\u03b35 ) = exp(\u2212i\u03b1\u03b35 /2)\u03b3\u03bc exp(i\u03b1\u03b35 /2), which\nobey the same identities as the \u03b3\u03bc , as well as \u03b3\u0303\u03bc \u03b3\u0303\u03bd = \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3\u03bd . Since \u03c8 contains a factor \u03b3 0 , we\nsee that Eqs. (17) and (26) plus the gravitino kinetic term are equivalent to the theory with\n1\n\nhQi = 0, with hP i replaced by (hP i2 + hQi2 ) 2 , and with all \u03b3\u03bc replaced by the corresponding\n\u03b3\u0303\u03bc , to which the supersymmetry proofs of Refs. [5] apply.\nLet us turn now to the generic case, in which the expectations h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i, hP i, and hQi\nare all nonzero. Using h\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd i = h\u03b800 i\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , Eq. (12) can be rewritten as\nh\u03b4j\u03bc i = 2\u03b3\u03bc h\u03b800 i\u01eb .\n8\n\n(28)\n\n\fSince a nonzero value of hj\u03bc i implies that supersymmetry is broken, we recover the usual\ncriterion, that supersymmetry in the matter sector is broken if and only if the positive\nsemidefinite matter vacuum energy density h\u03b800 i is nonzero. Adding h\u03b800 i to Eq. (16), the\ntotal vacuum energy density becomes\n\u03c1VAC = h\u03b800 i \u2212\n\n\u03ba2\n(hP i2 + hQi2 ) .\n48\n\n(29)\n\nRewriting Eq. (26) as\nZ\nZ\n1\n1 \u2032\n4\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\u2206Smass = m d x\u03c8 \u03bc (x)\u03c3 \u03c8\u03c1 (x) + m\nd4 x\u03c8 \u03bc (x)i\u03b35 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03c1 \u03c8\u03c1 (x) ,\n2\n2\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba2\nm = hP i , m\u2032 = hQi ,\n12\n12\n\n(30)\n\nthe condition for the vacuum energy density \u03c1VAC of Eq. (29) to vanish by cancellation\nbetween the matter and supergravity contributions is\nh\u03b800 i\n\u03ba\n3\n\u0014\n\n\u0015 12\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n\u03ba2\n(hP i2 + hQi2 ) 2 = (m2 + m\u2032 2 ) 2\n12\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nWe thus obtain a new derivation (when hQi=m\u2032 = 0) of the Deser-Zumino [7] formula for\nthe gravitino mass, as well as its extension to the case when the CP violating expectation\nhQi is nonzero.\nTo conclude, we have shown that by using the transformation properties of the current supermultiplet, one can analyze possibilities for supersymmetry breaking when supersymmetric matter is coupled to linearized supergravity. Nonlinear supergravity corrections\nto our results appear only at higher orders in the expansion in powers of \u03ba. In addition to\ngiving a compact current-algebraic derivation of the action for supergravity with a cosmological constant, and of the gravitino mass formula, our method generalizes these results to\nthe case when the matter theory breaks CP invariance, allowing the expectation hQi to be\nnonzero.\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the Department of Energy under Grant #DE\u2013\nFG02\u201390ER40542.
