INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, the generic properties of many-body quantum systems are studied with a renewed interest. They are expressed mostly by their statistical properties, i.e. by comparing\ntheir level distributions with those following from random matrix ensembles. The generic\nproperties are, as a rule, well expressed in the center of the spectra where the level density\nis high. As an example, the statistical properties of the shell-model states of nuclei around\n24\nMg are studied a few years ago [1] by using two-body forces which are obtained by fitting\nthe low-lying states of different nuclei of the 2s \u2212 1d shell. In the center of the spectra, the\ngeneric properties are well expressed in spite of the two-body character of the forces used in\nthe calculations.\nA surprising result is obtained recently in performing shell-model calculations for the\nsame systems with random two-body forces. In spite of the random character of the forces,\nthe regular properties of the low-lying states are described quite well [2] in these calculations.\nFurther studies [3,4] proved the relevance of the results obtained and could explain in detail\neven the regular properties at the border of the spectra obtained from random two-body\nforces [5]. Thus, generic properties of the spectra may arise from two-body forces, while\nregular properties may be described by means of random forces. This contra-intuitive result\nis, at present, not fully understood.\nThe spectra of microwave cavities are not determined by two-body forces. Nevertheless,\nthe calculated spectra are similar to those from nuclear reactions [6]. They show deviations\nfrom the spectra obtained from random matrix theory as well as similarities with them.\nThe theoretical results obtained are confirmed by experimental studies [7]. Most interesting\n1\n\n\fare, however, the results of an analysis of the statistical properties of the city transport in\nCuernavaca (Mexico). It is shown in [8] that the subsequent bus arrivals display probability\ndistributions conforming to those given by the unitary ensemble of random matrices.\nBy all these studies, the question on the origin of the generic properties of many-body\nquantum systems, observed at high level density, is raised anew. As a result of these studies,\nneither two-body forces nor quantum effects are decisive. The study of the city transport\nin Mexico can be understood as an equilibrium state of an interacting one-dimensional gas\nunder the assumption that the information contained in the positions of the individual\ngas particles is minimized [8]. The minimum information is caused obviously by some\ninformation exchange with the environment.\nQuantum systems having discrete states seem to exist isolated from an environment.\nIt is therefore an interesting question whether or not some information exchange with the\nenvironment can, nevertheless, take place and provide a certain loss of information on the\nindividual properties of the states.\nThe effect of avoided level crossing (Landau-Zener effect) is known and studied theoretically as well as experimentally for many years. It is a quite general property of the\ndiscrete states of a quantum system whose energies will never cross when there is a certain\nnon-vanishing interaction between them. Instead, they avoid crossing in energy and their\nwave functions are exchanged when traced as a function of a certain tuning parameter. The\navoided level crossings are related to the existence of exceptional points [9]. The relation\nof these points to geometrical phases is studied experimentally [10] as well as theoretically\n[11,12] in a microwave resonator by deforming it cyclically. The results show non-trivial\nphase changes when degeneracies appear near to one another [12]. The influence of level\ncrossings in the complex plane onto the spectra of atoms is studied in [13]. In this case, the\ncrossings are called hidden crossings [14].\nUsually, it is assumed that avoided level crossings do not introduce any correlations\nbetween the wave functions of the states as long as the system parameter is different from\nthe critical one at which the two states avoided crossing. Counter-examples have been\nfound, however, in recent numerical studies of the spectra of microwave cavities [6,15]. The\nintroduced correlations are traced back to branch points in the complex plane [16] which are\nthe crossing points of the states when continued into the complex plane.\nIf it is really a general phenomenon that branch points in the complex plane introduce\ncorrelations between discrete states of a closed quantum system, then an information exchange with the environment would take place also in quantum systems. This fact could\nsupport the analogy of the statistical properties of the city transport to those of quantum\nsystems and, above all, the interpretation of the statistical properties given in [8].\nIt is the aim of the present paper to study in detail the correlations in a quantum system\nwhich are introduced by branch points in the complex plane. First, the properties of the\nstates of an open quantum system in the very neighbourhood of a branch point will be\nstudied. In such a case, the S matrix has a double pole and the interaction between the two\nstates is maximum. The double pole coincides with the branch point in the complex plane.\nIt is shown further, that the branch point influences the properties of the resonance states\nnot only when the physical conditions for a double pole of the S matrix are fulfilled but also\nwhen the states avoid crossing. This result corresponds to those obtained for the realistic\ncase of laser induced continuum structures in atoms [17]. The influence of the branch points\n2\n\n\fis accompanied, in any case, by an exchange of the wave functions of the states.\nThe properties of resonance states in the neighbourhood of an avoided crossing are traced\nin the further studies of the present paper. More exactly: starting from the branch point\nwhere two resonance states with given widths \u03b31cr and \u03b32cr cross, the properties of two other\nstates with \u03b3i smaller or larger \u03b3icr are studied. For these two states, the physical conditions\nfor the formation of a double pole of the S matrix are not fulfilled. Finally, the \u03b3i are chosen\nto be zero. This study allows to compare the properties of resonance states with finite\nlifetime with those of discrete states under the influence of a branch point in the complex\nplane. The results show how the branch points in the complex plane continue analytically\ninto the function space of discrete states.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the mathematical properties of branch\npoints in the complex plane and their relation to avoided level crossings are sketched. In\nsection 3, numerical results for states at a double pole of the S matrix as well as for states with\navoided crossing are given. The main point studied are the correlations of the wave functions\nintroduced by an avoided level crossing. The results are discussed in the last section. They\nshow that some information loss appears in quantum systems at high level density under\nthe influence of the branch points in the complex plane. The information contained in the\npositions and wave functions of the individual states of the system is minimized in a similar\nmanner as in the city transport in Mexico.\nII. BRANCH POINTS IN THE COMPLEX PLANE\n\nThe avoided crossing of discrete levels is related to the existence of branch points in the\ncomplex plane. In order to illustrate this relation, let us study the properties of the complex\ntwo-by-two Hamiltonian matrix\nH=\n\ne1 (a) 0\n0 e2 (a)\n\n!\n\ni\n\u03b3 (a)\n2 1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\ni\n\u03b3 (a)\n2 2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe unperturbed energies ei and widths \u03b3i (i = 1, 2) of the two states depend on the\nparameter a to be tuned in such a manner that the two states may cross in energy (and/or\nwidth) when \u03c9 = 0. The two states interact only via the non-diagonal matrix elements \u03c9\nwhich may be complex, in general. The imaginary part of \u03c9 arises from the residuum of the\nintegral describing the interaction via the continuum of decay channels, see e.g. [18,19]. The\nreal part contains both the direct interaction of the two states and the principal value integral\nwhich appears from the interaction via the continuum. In the following, we consider only\nreal \u03c9 (and \u03b3i independent of a) since we are interested in the influence of the branch points\nonto the avoided crossing of discrete states. The influence of complex \u03c9 on the crossing of\nresonance states will be considered in a forthcoming paper.\nThe eigenvalues of H are\ni\n\u01eb1 + \u01eb2 1 q\nE\u00b1 \u2261 E\u00b1 \u2212 \u0393\u00b1 =\n\u00b1\n(\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )2 + 4\u03c9 2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u01ebj \u2261 ej \u2212 2i \u03b3j (j = 1, 2). According to equation (2), two interacting discrete states\n(with \u03b3i = 0) avoid always crossing since \u03c9 is real in this case. It is, however, possible to find\n3\n\n\fthe corresponding crossing point in the complex plane by considering non-vanishing values\ngi instead of the \u03b3i . Both, the gi and the \u03b3i , are proportional to the spectroscopic factors\n[16]. The common energy dependent factor in the \u03b3i causes \u03b3i \u2192 0 in approaching the decay\nthreshold where the resonance states become discrete. The common energy dependent factor\nin the gi is different from zero also for discrete states. The gi describe the transfer probability\nbetween different states.\nIt can further be seen from equation (2) that these crossing points are branch points in\nthe complex plane. Equation (2) shows also that resonance states with non-vanishing widths\n\u03b3i avoid mostly crossing since F (a, \u03c9) \u2261 (\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )2 + 4\u03c9 2 is different from zero for all a, as a\nrule. Only when F (a, \u03c9) = 0 at a = acr (and \u03c9 = \u03c9 cr ), the states cross. In such a case, the\nS matrix has a double pole, see e.g. [20]. Note that the branch point is determined by the\nvalues (\u03c9)2 and (\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )2 but not by the signs of these values. According to equation (2),\nit lies at X \u2261 (1/2){\u01eb1 (acr ) + \u01eb2 (acr )}.\nThe left and right eigenfunctions, \u03a6lti and \u03a6rt\ni (i = \u00b1), of a non-Hermitian matrix are\ndifferent from one another. Since the matrix (1) is symmetrical, it follows\nh\u03a6\u2217i | H = h\u03a6\u2217i | Ei\n\nand\n\nH |\u03a6i i = Ei |\u03a6i i ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u2217\nsee e.g. [17,19,21]. Therefore, \u03a6lti = \u03a6rt\n\u2261 \u03a6\u2217i . The eigenfunctions of H can be orthonori\nmalized according to\n\u2217\nh\u03a6lti |\u03a6rt\nj i = h\u03a6i |\u03a6j i = \u03b4ij\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a6rt\nj \u2261 \u03a6j . Equation (4) provides the bi-orthogonality relations\nh\u03a6i |\u03a6i i = R(h\u03a6i |\u03a6i i) = h\u03a6j |\u03a6j i ; A \u2261 h\u03a6i |\u03a6i i \u2265 1\nh\u03a6i |\u03a6j6=i i = i I(h\u03a6i |\u03a6j6=i i) = \u2212h\u03a6j6=i |\u03a6i i ; B \u2261 |h\u03a6i |\u03a6j6=i i| \u2265 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nAt the double pole, |h\u03a6i |\u03a6i i| \u2192 \u221e and |h\u03a6i |\u03a6j6=i i| \u2192 \u221e but h\u03a6\u2217i |\u03a6j i = \u03b4ij according to\nequation (4). Numerical examples for the values h\u03a6i |\u03a6j i with i = j as well as with i 6= j\ncan be found in [19,21\u201323]. Further, at the double pole the two wave functions are related\nby \u03a6i = \u00b1 i \u03a6j6=i [17].\nThe eigenfunctions \u03a6i can be represented in the set of basic wave functions \u03a60i of the\nunperturbed matrix corresponding to \u03c9 = 0,\n\u03a6i =\n\nX\n\nbij \u03a60j .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the critical region of avoided crossing, the eigenfunctions are mixed: bii = bjj and bij =\n\u2212bji for i 6= j. The bij are normalized according to equation (4).\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe numerical results obtained by diagonalizing the matrix (1) are shown in figures 1 to\n6. In all cases e1 = 1 \u2212 a/2, e2 = a and \u03c9 = 0.05. The \u03b3i do not depend on the tuning\nparameter a. At a = acr = 2/3, the two levels cross when unperturbed (i.e. \u03c9 = 0) and avoid\ncrossing, as a rule, when perturbed by the interaction \u03c9. When \u03b31 /2 = \u03b31cr /2 = 1.0, \u03b32 /2 =\n4\n\n\f\u03b32cr /2 = 1.1, the S matrix has a double pole meaning that the two resonance states cross in\nspite of \u03c9 6= 0. According to equation (2), the double pole of the S matrix is a branch point\nin the complex plane.\nIn figure 1, the energies E\u00b1 , widths \u0393\u00b1 and wave functions bij of the two states are\nshown as a function of the parameter a in the very neighbourhood of the branch point.\nApproaching the branch point at acr , |R(bij )| \u2192 \u221e and |I(bij )| \u2192 \u221e. While R(bij ) does\nnot change its sign by crossing the critical value acr , the phase of I(bij ) jumps from \u00b1 to\n\u2213. The orthogonality relations (4) are fulfilled for all a including the critical value acr .\nFigure 2 shows the energies E\u00b1 and widths \u0393\u00b1 of the two states for values of \u03b3i just\nabove and below the critical ones \u03b3icr and for \u03b3i = 0, i.e. for discrete states. When \u03b3i > \u03b3icr ,\nthe widths of the two states approach each other near acr but the width of one of the states\nremains always larger than the width of the other one. The two states cross freely in energy,\nand the wave functions are not exchanged after crossing the critical value acr .\nThe situation is completely different when \u03b3i < \u03b3icr . In this case, the states avoid crossing\nin energy while their widths cross freely. After crossing the critical value acr , the wave\nfunctions of the two states are exchanged. An exchange of the wave functions takes place\nalso in the case of discrete states (\u03b3i = 0). This latter result is well known as Landau-Zener\neffect. It is directly related to the branch point in the complex plane at acr as can be seen\nfrom figure 2.\nThe wave functions bij are shown in figure 3. The states are mixed (i.e. |bii | =\n6 1 and\nbij6=i 6= 0) in all cases in the neighbourhood of acr . In the case without exchange of the wave\nfunctions, R(bij ) as well as I(bij ) behave smoothly at acr while this is true only for R(bij )\nin the case with exchange of the wave functions. In this case, I(bij ) jumps from a certain\nfinite value y to \u2212y at acr . The I(bij ) of discrete states are zero. Thus, a jump in the I(bij )\ncan not appear. The R(bij ), however, show a dependence on a which is very similar to that\nof resonance states with exchange of the wave functions (\u03b3i < \u03b3icr ).\nIn order to trace the influence of the branch point in the complex plane onto the correlations of discrete states, the differences \u03b4 = |bii |2 \u2212 |bij6=i |2 and the values |bij |2 are shown\nin figures 4 and 5 for different values \u03b3i from \u03b3i > \u03b3icr to \u03b3i = 0. Most interesting is the\nchange of the value \u03b4 from 1 to 0 at \u03b3icr . The relation |bii |2 = |bij6=i |2 at \u03b3 < \u03b3icr is the result\nfrom interference processes. It holds also at \u03b3i = 0, i.e. for discrete states. In this case,\n|bii |2 = |bij6=i |2 = 0.5 at acr .\nThe values A and B characterizing the bi-orthogonality of the two wave functions are\nshown in figure 6 for the same values of \u03b3i as in figures 4 and 5. The A and B are similar\nfor \u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3icr = \u00b1\u2206 as long as \u2206 is small. They approach A \u2192 1 and B \u2192 0 for \u03b3i \u2192 0.\nIn figure 7, the energies Ei and mixing coefficients |bij |2 are shown for illustration for\nfour discrete states with three neighboured avoided crossings as a function of a.

They are the result of complicated interference processes. This can\n5\n\n\fbe seen best by comparing the two pictures with four interacting states (top and middle in\nfigure 7) with those of only two interacting states (bottom of figure 7 and bottom right of\nfigure 5).

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS\n\nMost calculations represented in the present paper are performed for two states which\ncross or avoid crossing under the influence of an interaction \u03c9 which is real. A general\nfeature appearing in all the results is the repulsion of the levels in energy (except in the very\nneighbourhood of acr when \u03b3i \u2265 \u03b3icr ). This result follows analyically from the eigenvalue\nequation (2). It holds quite generally for real \u03c9 as discussed by means of the spectra of\nmicrowave cavities [6] and laser-induced continuum structures in atoms [17]. The level\nrepulsion in energy is accompanied by an approaching of the lifetimes (widths) of the states.\nThe value acr is determined by the free crossing in energy of the two non-interacting\nstates \u03a60i (corresponding to \u03c9 = 0) in the cases considered. The avoided level crossing at\nthe critical value acr can be seen clearly only when the interaction \u03c9 is small. For larger\n\u03c9, the avoided crossings are washed out and are difficult to identify without performing a\ndetailed analysis of the data. As a consequence, there are much more avoided level crossings\nin quantum systems at high level density than usually believed and the influence of the\nbranch points may be quite important. The last point does not coincide with any intuitive\nassumptions.\nThe value of the (real) interaction \u03c9 in relation to the value of the widths \u03b3i is decisive\nwhether or not the states will be exchanged at the critical value acr of the tuning parameter,\ni.e. whether or not the states avoid crossing. When \u03c9 is so small that the difference of\nthe widths \u0393+ \u2212 \u0393\u2212 is different from zero at acr then the states will not be exchanged.\nIf, however, \u0393+ = \u0393\u2212 at acr , the states will be exchanged. The exchange occurs due to\ninterferences between the different components of the wave functions. This can be seen best\nfor resonance states with \u03b3i 6= 0 where interferences between the real and imaginary parts\nof the wave functions play an important role (see figure 5).\nAt the double pole of the S matrix, not only \u0393+ = \u0393\u2212 but also E+ = E\u2212 for acr . Here,\nthe real and imaginary parts of all components of the wavefunctions increase boundless\nand \u03a6i \u2192 \u00b1 i \u03a6j6=i [17]. Avoided level crossings are characterized by E+ 6= E\u2212 at acr . In\nthese cases, the increase of the components of the wave functions at acr is reduced due to\ninterferences. The interferences can be seen, e.g., from the differences \u03b4 = |bii |2 \u2212 |bij6=i |2\nwhich jump from 1 to 0 at the branch point (see figure 4). This jump is related to the\nnormalization condition (4) which is fulfilled also at the double pole of the S matrix. The\njump makes possible the exchange of the wave functions. The value \u03b4 = 0 remains when\n(\u03b31 /2 \u2212 \u03b32 /2)2 < 4 \u03c9 2 , i.e. also for discrete states.\nThe bi-orthogonality (5) of the wave functions characterizes the avoided crossing of\nresonance states. It increases boundless at the double pole of the S matrix and vanishes in\nthe case of an avoided crossing of discrete states (figure 6).\n6\n\n\fThe results of all the calculations presented in the present paper show very clearly that,\nfrom a mathematical point of view, the branch points in the complex plane continue analytically into the function space of discrete states. Their influence on the properties of discrete\nstates cannot be neglected.\nAnother result of the present study is the influence of the branch points in the complex\nplane onto the purity of the wave functions \u03a6\u00b1 . At acr , the wave functions are not only\nexchanged but become mixed. The mixing occurs not only at the critical point acr but in a\ncertain region around acr when the crossing is avoided. This fact is important at high level\ndensity where, as a rule, an avoided crossing with another level appears before \u03a6i \u2192 \u03a60j is\nreached. As a result, all the wave functions of closely-lying states are strongly mixed, i.e.\nthe states are strongly correlated at high level density (see figure 7).\nThe strong mixing of the wave functions of a quantum system at high level density\nmeans that the information on the individual properties of the states \u03a60i is lost. While the\nexchange of the wave functions itself is of no interest for a statistical consideration of the\nstates, the accompanying correlation of the states is decisive for the statistics. This fact is\ndiscussed also in [24]. As shown in the present paper, the correlation of the states may be\ntraced back to the existence of branch points in the complex plane. The number of branch\npoints in the complex plane is large at high level density. Therefore, the discrete states of\nquantum systems at high level density lose any information on their individual properties.\nThat means, they contain minimum information.\nThus, there is an information exchange between a (closed) quantum system and the\ncontinuum due to the analyticity of the wave functions. The branch points in the complex\nplane are hidden crossings, indeed. They play an important role not only in atoms, as\nsupposed in [13,14], but determine the properties of all quantum systems at high level\ndensity.\nThe loss of information on the properties of discrete states of a quantum system under\nthe influence of branch points in the complex plane is in complete analogy to the conclusion\ndrawn from the statistical properties of the city transport in Cuernavaca (Mexico) [8]. Also\nin this case, an information exchange with the environment leads to an information loss in\nthe system.\nIt follows further that the statistical properties of quantum systems at high level density\nare different from those at low level density. States at the border of the spectrum are almost\nnot influenced by branch points in the complex plane since their number is small. There\nare almost no states which could cross or avoid crossing with others states. The properties\nof these states are expected therefore to show more individual features than those at high\nlevel density. In other words, the information on the individual properties of the states \u03a60i\nat the border of the spectrum is kept to a great deal in contrast to that on the states in the\ncenter of the spectrum.\nSummarizing the results, it can be stated the following. Branch points in the complex\nplane cause an exchange of the wave functions and, above all, create correlations between the\nstates of a quantum system at high level density even if the system is closed and the states\nare discrete. These correlations are equivalent to a loss of information on the individual\nbasic states. This result may explain the similarity between the statistical properties of the\n\n7\n\n\fcity transport in Cuernavaca (Mexico) and those of a quantum system at high level density.\nAcknowledgment: Valuable discussions with E.
