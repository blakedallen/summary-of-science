In particular, ultrafast nonlinear optical responses of\nsingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in suspensions and in films have been\ninvestigated intensively in recent years [12-17]. Transient photobleaching has been\nobserved with femtosecond laser pulses at photon energies of 0.8 ~ 1.1 eV (wavelength \u03bb\n= 1.1 to 1.5 \u03bcm), resonant with the lowest inter-band transitions of semiconducting\nSWCNTs. The imaginary part of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility, Im\u03c7(3), has been\ndetermined to be as large as 10-7 esu [16]. Saturable absorption has also been detected at\nphoton energies of ~ 1.47 eV (\u03bb ~ 843 nm), near the second lowest inter-band transitions\nof semiconducting electronic structure in SWCNTs [14]. In addition, transient\nphotoinduced absorption has been reported under off-resonant conditions. The resonant\nsaturable absorption is identified as a band-filling mechanism, while the off-resonant\nphotoinduced absorption is attributed to a global redshift of the \u03c0-plasmon resonance\n[14].\nNote that all the above-mentioned investigations focus on the imaginary part of\n\u03c7(3) and its picosecond (or subpicosecond) relaxation. It is known that the real part of the\nthird-order nonlinear susceptibility, Re\u03c7(3), is another key parameter if carbon nanotubes\nare to be used as ultrafast switching materials. It is generally accepted that multi-walled\ncarbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) behave like metals. We expect that the \u03c0-electrons should\nplay an important role in the electronic structures and optical properties of MWCNTs. In\nSWCNTs, the \u03c0-plasmon resonance is located at ~5 eV and spans the entire visible\nspectral region with a tail extending to near-infrared wavelengths [14]. The \u03c0-plasmon is\na collective excitation of the \u03c0 electrons. In a bulk medium, this resonance is not coupled\nto light. But, in the case of nanoscale objects, it changes into a surface plasmon. In\nmetallic nanoparticles like silver particles, it gives rise to large values of Im\u03c7(3) and\nRe\u03c7(3) [18]. We believe that similar nonlinear optical processes should occur in\nMWCNTs. Here we report the observation of negative absorptive and refractive\nnonlinearities in a film of MWCNTs under off-resonant conditions. These cubic\n\n\fnonlinearities also exhibit ultrafast relaxation. All these findings strongly suggest the\npotential of MWCNT films for all-optical switching.\nThe MWCNT film grown on quartz substrate was prepared by a method of\nplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The details of the preparation were reported\nelsewhere [19,20]. Figure 1(a) shows a high magnification scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) image on the side view of the film and substrate. It shows that the carbon\nnanotubes, like bushes, are grown mainly in the direction perpendicular to the surface of\nthe substrate, although some of the tubes are entangled with one another. The size\ndistribution of the as-grown sample is displayed in Fig. 1(b), showing an average\ndiameter of ~ 40 nm and an average length (or film thickness) of 1.3 \u03bcm. The linear and\nnonlinear optical properties of the MWCNT film were examined as the laser light\npropagates in the axis perpendicular to the quartz substrate (or normal incidence on the\nfilm) at room temperature. Figure 1(c) displays the absorption spectrum of the MWCNT\nfilm at photon energies between 1 and 6 eV. It clearly demonstrates that the optical\nproperty of the MWCNT film is dominated by an absorption resonance peaked at 5.4 eV.\nIt is assigned as the \u03c0-plasmon resonance, which is about 0.4 eV blue shifted in\ncomparison to that of SWCNTs measured by Lauret et al. [14]. The blue shift is\nanticipated since there are more \u03c0-electrons in MWCNTs than in SWCNTs.\nTo minimize average power and reduce accumulative thermal effects, we\nemployed 100-fs laser pulses at 1 kHz repetition rate. The laser pulses were generated by\na mode-locked Ti: Sapphire laser (Quantronix, IMRA), which seeded a Ti: Sapphire\nregenerative amplifier (Quantronix, Titan). The wavelengths were tunable as the laser\npulses passed through an optical parametric amplifier (Quantronix, TOPAS). The laser\npulses were focused onto the MWCNT film with a minimum beam waist of ~ 42 \u03bcm.\nThe incident and transmitted laser powers were monitored as the MWCNT film was\nmoved (or Z-scanned) along the propagation direction of the laser pulses. Figure 2\ndisplays typical open- and closed-aperture Z-scans, showing negative signs for the\nabsorptive and refractive nonlinearities. We assume that the observed absorptive and\nrefractive nonlinearities can be described by \u2206\u03b1 = \u03b12 I and \u2206n = n2 I , respectively; where\n\n\f\u03b12 is the nonlinear absorption coefficient, n2 is the nonlinear refractive index, and I is the\nlight irradiance. Both the \u03b12 and n2 values are extracted from the best fittings between the\ndata and the Z-scan theory [21]. We plot the extracted \u03b12 and n2 values as a function of\nthe maximum irradiance for each Z-scan. As shown in Fig. 3, it is evident that the \u03b12 and\nn2 parameters are independent of the irradiance, indicating a pure third-order nonlinear\noptical process in the irradiance regime up to 300 GW/cm2. No observation of saturation\nin \u03b12 and n2 clearly demonstrates that the underlying mechanism in MWCNTs is different\nfrom resonant saturable absorption in SWCNTs, in which the saturation in the inter-band\ntransitions of semiconducting electronic structures plays an important role [14,17].\nWithin our experimental errors, Fig. 2 shows little change in the magnitudes of the\nmeasured \u03b12 and n2, as the photon energies are tuned from 1.59 to 1.72 eV (780 to 720\nnm), indicating a nonresonant nature of our observed nonlinearities. This is consistent\nwith the absorption spectrum in Fig. 1(c), which shows that the probed wavelengths are\nin the tail of the \u03c0-plasmon resonance.\nAt 780 nm, we determine that \u03b12 = -29 cm/GW (or Im\u03c7 (3) = - 1.6 x 10-11 esu); and\nn2 = -3 x 10-4 cm2/GW (or Re \u03c7 (3) = -1.7 x 10-11 esu). Hence |\u03c7 (3)| = [(Im \u03c7 (3))2 +\n(Re \u03c7 (3))2]1/2 = 2.2 x 10-11 esu for the MWCNT film. By comparison, a value of 8.3 x 1013\n\nesu at 800 nm was observed for |\u03c7 (3)| in carbon nanoparticles embedded in sol-gel SiO2\n\nglass [22]. For a SWCNT solution at a concentration of 0.33 mg/mL, it was reported to\nbe 4 x 10-13 esu at 820 nm [12]. Our larger value of |\u03c7 (3)| is attributed to the high\nconcentration of MWCNTs packed in a 1.3 \u03bcm-thick layer. In our previously reported\nclosed-aperture Z-scans on solutions of MWCNT/polymer composites [11], a positive\nsign of n2 was detected in association with thermally originated nonlinear scattering for\noptical limiting. The negative sign of the measured n2 (or self-defocusing) implies that\nthermal effects are insignificant in the MWCNT film. In most of semiconductors,\nultrafast off-resonant nonlinearities are dominated by two-photon absorption and bound\nelectronic optical Kerr effect (or self-focusing effect). These nonlinear processes result in\npositive signs for the \u03b12 and n2 nonlinear parameters; and lead to laser-induced damage at\n\n\fhigh irradiances. On the contrary, the observed nonlinearities in the MWCNT film are\nnegative and, therefore, are desirable in optical applications.\nTo evaluate the relaxation time and to gain an insight of the underlying\nmechanism for the observed cubic nonlinearities, we conducted a degenerate pump-probe\nexperiment at 780 nm with the use of 250-fs laser pulses from a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire\nlaser (Spectro-Physics, Tsunami). Figure 4 illustrates the transient transmission signals\n(\u2206T/T) as a function of the delay time for three pump irradiances. With the film excited\nby the pump pulses, an optically induced transparency occurs. As the pump irradiance\nincreases, the signal increases. All these findings are consistent with our Z-scan\nmeasurements. The transient signals clearly shows there are two components. By using a\ntwo-exponential component model, the best fits (solid lines in Fig. 4) produce \u03c41 = ~ 250\nfs and \u03c42 = ~ 2 ps. We believe that \u03c41 is the autocorrelation of the laser pulses used. The\n\u03c42 component is the recovery time of the excited \u03c0-electrons in the MWCNT film. Its\ntime scale is comparable to the findings for carbon nanoparticles [22] and SWCNTs [1217]. The nature of this relaxation is unclear at present. The relaxation through charge\ntransfer via coherent tunneling processes to neighboring metallic tubes is possible [14]\nand such a relaxation has been observed in C60 fullerene films [23]. Further studies far\nbeyond the scope of this investigation are required to unambiguously identify the nature\nof the relaxation in the MWCNT film.\nIn summary, we have presented femtosecond Z-scan and pump-probe\nmeasurements on a 1.3-\u03bcm-thick MWCNT film, in which the nanotubes are aligned\nmainly in the propagation direction of the laser pulses. These measurements show the\nMWCNT film possesses cubic nonlinear absorption and refraction in the laser irradiance\nrange from a few to 300 GW/cm2. These nonresonant and negative nonlinearities exhibit\nmagnitudes of ~10-11 esu at 780 nm and a relaxation time of ~ 2 ps.\n\n\fReferences\n[1]. J.W. Mintmire, B.I. Dunlap, and C.T. White, Phys. Rev.

The solid lines are\nthe best-fit curves calculated by using the Z-scan theory reported in Ref. [21]. The\nfilled and open circles in (a) and (c) are the Z-scans without aperture, while the\nfilled and open circles in (b) and (d) are the Z-scans with aperture.\nFig. 3 Irradiance independence of (a) \u03b12 and (b) n2 values measured at 780 nm.\nFig. 4 Degenerate 250-fs time-resolved pump-probe measurements of the MWCNT film\npreformed at 780 nm with three different pump irradiances. The top and middle\ncurves are shifted vertically for clear presentation. The solid lines are twoexponential fitting curves with \u03c41 = 250 fs and \u03c42 = ~ 2 ps.\n\n\f(a)\n\nCounts (%)\n\n50\n\n(b)\n\n40\n\nMWCNTs\nLogNormal Fit\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nAbsorbance (a.u)\n\nDiameter (nm)\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n(C)\n\n\u03c0-plasmon\nresonance\nat \u03bb = ~229 nm\nMWCNTs\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nPhoton energy (eV)\nFig. 1.\n\n6\n\n\f1.20\n\n1.20\n\n(a)\n\nNormalized Transmittance\n\n(b)\n\n720 nm\n\n1.15\n\n2\n\nI =144 GW/cm\n\n1.10\n\n1.10\n\n1.05\n\n1.05\n\n1.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n\n-6\n1.20\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\n1.15\n\n4\n\n6\n\n780 nm\nI =101 GW/cm2\n\n1.10\n1.05\n1.00\n0.95\n0.90\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.90\n1.16\n1.14\n1.12\n1.10\n1.08\n1.06\n1.04\n1.02\n1.00\n0.98\n0.96\n0.94\n\nI =144 GW/cm2\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n(d)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n780 nm\nI =101 GW/cm2\n\n-6\n\nZ (cm)\n\nFig. 2.\n\n720 nm\n\n1.15\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\f\u03b12 (x 10 cm/GW)\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n-1\n\n\u03b12\n\n-1\n\n\u03bb = 780 nm\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n-1\n\nn2\n\u03bb = 780 nm\n\n-2\n\n-5\n300\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nIrradiance (GW/cm2)\nFig. 3.\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-5\n\nn2 (x 10-4 cm2/GW)\n\n0\n\n250\n\n-5\n300\n\n\f28\n2.65 G W /cm 2\n2.35 G W /cm 2\n1.75 G W /cm 2\n\n24\n\n\u2206T/T (a.u)\n\n20\n16\n12\n8\n4\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTim e Delay (ps)\nFigure 4.\n\n3\n\n\f"}
