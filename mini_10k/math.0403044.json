We obtain an embedding theorem for compact strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds which are bounadries of some complete Hermitian manifolds. We use this to compactify some negatively curved K\u00e4hler manifolds with compact strongly pseudoconvex boundary.\nAn embedding theorem for Sasakian manifolds is also derived.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nA natural question in the study of CR manifolds is the embeddability question: given a\nstrongly pseudoconvex CR manifold X , do there exist an integer N and a smooth embedding\nM \u0592\u2192 CN such that the CR structure on X is the one induced from the complex structure\non CN ? It is known that the embedability of X is equivalent to the fillability, that is the\nexistence of a compact complex manifold T with strongly pseudoconvex boundary, such\nthat \u2202T = X . Indeed, Harvey-Lawson's theorem [HL75] shows that X is fillable if it is\nembeddable. Conversely, if X is fillable and \u2202T = X , a theorem of Grauert [Gra62] shows\nthat T can be taken to be a Stein space with isolated singularities, and one can apply the\nembedding theorem of Remmert-Bishop-Narasimhan [Nar60].\nBy a theorem due to Boutet de Monvel [BdM75], any compact (2n \u2212 1)-dimensional\nstrongly pseudoconvex CR manifold is embeddable in some CN if its dimension is greater\nthan or equal to five (n > 3). On the other hand, there is a classical example of H. Rossi\n[Ros65] (see also [Bur79], [Fal92]) which shows that an arbitrarily small, real-analytic perturbation of the standard structure on the three-sphere may fail to be embeddable. There\nexists an extensive literature on the embeddability of deformations of CR structures, see e.g.\nJ. Bland and C. L. Epstein [BE96], D. M. Burns and C. L. Epstein [BE90], C. L. Epstein and\nG. M. Henkin [EH00], L. Lempert [Lem95].\nOur goal is to get embedding theorems for compact strongly pseudoconvex CR manifolds,\nwhich are already boundaries of non-compact strongly pseudoconvex complex manifolds\n(see Definition 3.1). The complex manifolds we consider are complete Hermitian manifolds\n \u0304 \u2217 acting on\nwith an additional assumption on the spectral properties of the operator \u2202+\u2202\nsquare integrable forms. Our main technical result is the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.1. Let M be a complex manifold with compact strongly pseudoconvex boundary\nand of complex dimension n > 2. Assume that Int M has a complete Hermitian metric such\n\u2217\nthat (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). Then there exists a CR embedding of the\nboundary \u2202M in CN for some integer N.\nWe then give two applications of this result. The first one concerns manifolds with pinched\nnegative curvature and compact strongly pseudoconvex boundary.\nDate: August 27, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 32V30, 32V15, 32Q05.\nThe second-named author has been (partially) supported by the European Commission through the Research\nTraining Network HPRN-CT-1999-00118 \"Geometric Analysis\".\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG. MARINESCU AND N. YEGANEFAR\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let M be a connected complex manifold with compact strongly pseudoconvex\nboundary and of complex dimension n > 2. Assume that Int M is endowed with a complete\nK\u00e4hler metric with pinched negative curvature, such that away from a neighborhood of \u2202M,\nthe volume of M is finite. Then\n(1) \u2202M is embeddable in some CN .\n(2) M can be compactified to a strongly pseudoconvex domain in a projective variety by\nadding an exceptional analytic set, that is, there exists a compact strongly pseudoconvex domain D in a smooth projective variety and an embedding h : M \u2192 D which\nis a biholomorphism between Int M and h(Int M), h(\u2202M) = \u2202D, and D r h(M) is an\nexceptional analytic set which can be blown down to a finite set.\nThis is a generalization of [SY82, Main Theorem] in the case when a strongly pseudoconvex end is allowed. The method follows [NR98] and consists in filling \u2202M with a Stein space\nS (this is granted by Theorem 1.1) and using a theorem of Lempert [Lem95, Theorem 1.2] to\nembed S in a projective variety X . The complement Y := X r S can be glued to the original\nb By using the results of\nmanifold M to construct a projective pseudoconcave manifold M.\nb\n[And63] we can compactify this manifold and by [SY82] or [MD02] the complement of M\nis an exceptional analytic set.\nAs a consequence we study some quotients of the unit complex ball B in Cn which where\nconsidered by Burns and Napier-Ramachandran [NR98, Theorem 4.2].\nCorollary 1.3. Let \u0393 be a torsion-free discrete group of automorphisms of the unit ball B\nin C2 and let M = B/\u0393. Assume that the limit set \u039b is a proper subset of \u2202B and that the\nquotient (\u2202B r \u039b)/\u0393 has a compact component A. Let E be the end of M corresponding\nto A and assume that M r E has finite volume. Then A is embeddable in some CN and M\ncan be compactified to a strongly pseudoconvex domain in a projective variety by adding an\nexceptional analytic set.\nIn [NR98] the case n > 3 is considered and it is shown that the volume of M r E is\nautomatically finite. Indeed, if n > 3, \u2202M is embeddable by [BdM75] and the method described above, combined with the holomorphic Morse inequalities of [NT88], show that\nvol(M r E) < \u221e. Napier and Ramachandran also remark [NR98, Remark, p. 392] that one\ncould prove an analogue of Corollary 1.3 in the case n > 3, by using the techniques of SiuYau [SY82].\nOur second application of Theorem 1.1 is an embedding result for Sasakian manifolds (the\ndefinition of this particular class of strongly pseudoconvex manifolds will be given in \u00a75).\nLet X be a Sasakian manifold. In [BH02], O. Biquard and M. Herzlich construct a K\u00e4hler\nmetric on the product (0, \u221e) \u00d7 X , called asymptotically complex hyperbolic. X can then be\nviewed as the pseudoconvex boundary of some K\u00e4hler manifold, and therefore our technique\ncan be applied to prove\nTheorem 1.4. Let X be a Sasakian manifold of dimension at least 3. Then there is a CR\nembedding of X in CN for some integer N.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we disscuss the Hodge decomposition for the\nspace of square integrable forms. In \u00a73-4, we prove Theorem 1.1 and 1.2. Finally in \u00a75, we\nreview some basic facts about Sasakian manifolds, explain the construction of asymptotically\nhyperbolic manifolds, and prove Theorem 1.4.\n2. H ODGE\n\nDECOMPOSITION\n\nLet (M, g) be a complex complete Hermitian manifold. For any integers p and q, we\np,q\ndenote by C0 (M) the space of smooth (p, q)-differential forms with compact support, and\n\n\fEMBEDDABILITY OF SOME STRONGLY PSEUDOCONVEX CR MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\u2217\n\np,q\n\nby L2 (M) the space of square integrable (p, q)-forms. Now consider the operator \u2202 + \u2202 ,\n\u2217\nwhere \u2202 acts as an unbounded operator on square integrable forms, and \u2202 is the Hilbert\n\u2217\nspace adjoint of \u2202. The L2 -kernel H p,q (M, g) of \u2202 + \u2202 is by definition the space of L2\nharmonic (p, q)\u2212forms. In order to solve the \u2202-equation, one is primarily interested to know\nwhether H p,q (M, g) is finite dimensional and \u2202 has a closed range as an unbounded operator\n\u2217\n\u2217\nacting on L2 -forms. For example, this is the case if \u2202 + \u2202 (or equivalently \u0003 := (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 ) is\nFredholm on its domain. It is well known that we he have the following characterization of\nFredholmness (see for example [Ang93]).\n\u2217\n\nProposition 2.1. The operator (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (p, q) if and only if we have\na Poincar\u00e9 inequality at infinity: there exist a compact subset K of M and a constant C > 0\nsuch that\n\u2217\n\np,q\n\n\u2200u \u2208 C0 (M r K), C||u||2L2 6 ||\u2202u||2L2 + ||\u2202 u||2L2 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nOur discussion applies to weighted spaces too. Namely, let \u03be : M \u2192 R be a smooth func\u2217,\u2217\ntion defined on M, and let L2,\u03be (M) be the Hilbert space completion of C0 (M) with respect\nto the weighted norm\nZ\nkuk2L2,\u03be =\n\nM\n\n|u|2e\u2212\u03be dvg ,\n\nwhere dvg is the Riemannian measure. The operator \u2202 acts as an unbounded operator on\n\u2217\nL2,\u03be (M), and its adjoint is denoted by \u2202\u03be ; we have\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2202\u03be = e\u03be \u2202 e\u2212\u03be .\n\u2217\n\nThe space of (\u2202 + \u2202\u03be )-harmonic (p, q) forms is\np,q\n\n\u2217\n\np,q\n\nH\u03be (M, g) = {u \u2208 L2,\u03be (M) : \u2202u = \u2202\u03be u = 0}.\nA key property of Fredholmness is the following:\n\u2217\n\nProposition 2.2. Let (M, g) be a complete Hermitian complex manifold. Assume that \u2202 + \u2202\u03be\np,q\nis Fredholm in bidegree (p, q). Then H\u03be (M, g) is finite dimensional, and we have the\nfollowing strong orthogonal Hodge decomposition\n(2.2)\n\np,q\n\np,q\u22121\n\np,q\n\nL2,\u03be = H\u03be (M, g) \u2295 Im(\u2202 : L2,\u03be\n\np,q\n\n\u2217\n\np,q+1\n\n\u2192 L2,\u03be ) \u2295 Im(\u2202\u03be : L2,\u03be\n\np,q\n\n\u2192 L2,\u03be ) .\n\nFor the proof of Theorem 1.2 we need the following example of manifolds for which the\n\u2217\noperator (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm at certain degrees.\nProposition 2.3 (Gromov). If (M, g) is a complete K\u00e4hler manifold whose fundamental form\nis d(bounded) (at least outside a compact subset) in the sense of Gromov, the operator (\u2202 +\n\u2217\n\u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (p, q), if p + q 6= dimC (M).\n\nRecall that the hypothesis means that for a bounded 1\u2212form \u03b7, the fundamental form \u03c9\nof the metric g satisfies \u03c9 = d\u03b7 outside a compact subset K. Then the method of proof of\n[Gro91, Theorem 1.4.A], using the Lefschetz decomposition theorem, shows that for some\nconstant C > 0 depending only on the dimension of M and the bound on the norm of \u03b7, we\nhave\np,q\n\n\u2200p + q 6= dimC (M), \u2200u \u2208 C0 (M r K), C||u||2L2 6 h\u2206u, uiL2 = 2h\u0003u, uiL2 .\n\nHere, the last equality is a consequence of the K\u00e4hler assumption, for we then have \u2206 = 2\u0003,\nand after integrating by parts, we get the estimates of (2.1).\n\n\f4\n\nG. MARINESCU AND N. YEGANEFAR\n\n3. E MBEDDING\n\nOF SOME STRONGLY PSEUDOCONVEX\n\nCR\n\nMANIFOLDS\n\nThe aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1.1. We first review the notion of CR structure\nand complex manifold with strongly pseudoconvex boundary. In Lemma 3.3, we construct\na complete metric and a suitable weight \u03be on a strongly pseudoconvex subdomain \u03a90 of M,\n\u2217\nsuch that the operator (\u2202 + \u2202\u03be )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). Then Lemma 3.4 provides\npeak holomorphic functions at \u2202\u03a90 . We use these peak functions in the proof of Theorem\n1.1 in order to fill \u2202\u03a90 and then \u2202M.\nLet \u03a9 be a strongly pseudoconvex domain in a complex manifold M. From the complex\nstructure of M, we can build on the boundary of \u03a9 a partial complex structure which is called\na Cauchy-Riemann or CR structure. More generally, let Y be a smooth orientable manifold of\n(real) dimension (2n \u22121). A CR structure on Y is an (n \u22121)-dimensional complex subbundle\nH(1,0)Y of the complexified tangent bundle TCY such that\nH(1,0)Y \u2229 H(1,0)Y = {0},\nand such that H(1,0) is integrable as a complex subbundle of TCY (i.e. if u and v are sections\nof H(1,0)Y , the Lie bracket [u, v] is still a section of H(1,0)Y ).\nIf Y is a CR manifold, then its Levi distribution H is the real subbundle of TY defined by\nH = Re{H(1,0)Y \u2295 H(1,0)Y }. There exists on H a complex structure J given by J(u + u) =\n\u221a\n\u22121(u \u2212 u), with u \u2208 H(1,0)Y . As Y is orientable, the real line bundle H \u22a5 \u2282 T \u2217Y admits\na global nonvanishing section \u03b8. The CR structure is said to be strongly pseudoconvex if\nd\u03b8(., J.) defines a positive definite metric on H. Notice that in this case, \u03b8 \u2227 (d\u03b8)n\u22121 6= 0,\nand \u03b8 defines a real contact structure on Y .\nWe need the notion of complex manifold with strongly pseudoconvex boundary.\nDefinition 3.1. A complex manifold M with strongly pseudoconvex boundary is a real manifold with boundary, of dimension 2n, satisfying the following conditions: (i) the interior\nInt M = M r \u2202M has an integrable complex structure and (ii) for each point x \u2208 \u2202M there exist a neighborhood U in M, a strongly pseudoconvex domain D \u2282 Cn with smooth boundary,\nand a diffeomorphism h from U onto a relatively open subset h(U ) such that h(\u2202U ) \u2282 \u2202D\nand h is biholomorphic from IntU to Int h(U ).\nFrom this definition we infer:\nConsequence 3.2. The complex structure induces an integrable Cauchy-Riemann structure\non the boundary \u2202M. Moreover, if \u2202M is compact, there exists a defining function \u03c6 : M \u2192\n(\u2212\u221e, c] such that \u2202M = {\u03c6 = c}, with the properties: (1) its Levi form is positive definite on\nthe holomorphic tangent space of \u2202M and (2) \u03c6 is strictly plurisubharmonic on {c0 < \u03c6 < c}.\nWe can assume that c0 < 0 < c and that 0 is a regular value of \u03c6 and consider the strongly\npseudoconvex domain \u03a90 = {\u03c6 < 0}.\n\nFor the lemmas leading to Theorem 1.1, we construct a smooth function \u03bb : (\u2212\u221e, 0) \u2192 R+\nsuch that \u03bb = 0 in a neighborhood of \u2212\u221e and \u03bb\u2032 > 0, \u03bb\u2032\u2032 > 0 in a neighborhood of 0. We\nwill impose two conditions on the growth of \u03bb near 0.

Assume that M can be endowed with a complete Hermitian metric such that\n\u2217\nthe operator (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). Then there exists on \u03a90 a complete\nHermitian metric (sending the boundary at infinity) for which the weight e\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6) is integrable\n\u2217\nnear the boundary and the operator (\u2202 + \u2202\u03bb(\u03c6) )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1).\nProof. Consider the complete metric g on \u03a90 obtained by gluing the original metric of M\nwith the K\u00e4hler metric defined near the boundary \u2202\u03a90 by the K\u00e4hler form\n\u221a\n\u03c9 = \u2212 \u22121 \u2202\u2202 log(\u2212\u03c6),\n\u221a\n\u2202\u2202\u03c6 \u221a\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2227 \u2202\u03c6\n= \u2212 \u22121\n+ \u22121\n.\n\u03c6\n\u03c62\nStrict plurisubharmonicity of \u03c6 ensures that \u03c9 is positive. Near the boundary, the volume\nof g behaves like O((\u2212\u03c6)\u2212(n+1) ) (see e.g. [Yeg04, Lemma 4.2]), so that e\u2212\u03c8 = (\u2212\u03c6)n+2\nis integrable around \u03c6 = 0. By (3.1), e\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6) 6 e\u2212\u03c8 , hence e\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6) is also integrable around\n\u03c6 = 0.\n\u2217\nWe now prove that the operator (\u2202 + \u2202\u03bb(\u03c6) )2 associated to this metric is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). We have to show that the estimates (2.1) hold for smooth (0, 1)-forms which are\ncompactly supported at infinity.\nIf we are sufficiently far from the boundary \u2202\u03a90 , then the new metric is equal to the\noriginal metric of M, and the weight e\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6) is identically one. Therefore, by assumption\nand by Proposition 2.1, these estimates are valid for forms with compact support in \u03a90 ,\nsufficiently far from the boundary \u2202\u03a90 .\nIt remains to prove (2.1) for a (0, 1)-form u with compact support near the boundary, i.e.\nin {\u03c6 > \u2212\u03b4}. We shall use the Bochner-Kodaira formula. We endow the trivial line bundle\nE = \u03a90 \u00d7 C with the Hermitian metric h = e\u2212\u03bb(\u03c6) . Consider the holomorphic vector bundle\ne u 7\u2192 ue the natural isometry\nEe = E \u2297 \u039bn T M.

This finishes the proof of the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nG. MARINESCU AND N. YEGANEFAR\n\nThe following result is the analog of [MD02, Corollary 2.6].\nLemma 3.4. Assume that M can be endowed with a complete Hermitian metric such that\n\u2217\nthe operator (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). Let p be a point of the boundary \u2202\u03a90 ,\nand f a holomorphic function defined in a neighborhood of p such that { f = 0} \u2229 \u03a90 = {p}.\nThen for any m big enough, there exist a function g \u2208 O (\u03a90) \u2229 C\u221e (\u03a90 r {p}), a smooth\nfunction \u03a6 on a neighborhood V of p, and constants a1 , . . . , am\u22121 such that\n1 + am\u22121 f + . . . + a1 f m\u22121\n+\u03a6\nfm\non V \u2229 \u03a90 . In particular, we have limz\u2192p |g(z)| = \u221e.\ng=\n\nProof. We follow the same line of reasoning as in [MD02, Corollary 2.6] with only minor\nchanges. For \u03b5 > 0, set\n\u03a9\u03b5 = {\u03c6 < \u03b5},\nand choose \u03b5 small enough so that \u03a9\u03b5 is strongly pseudoconvex. Replacing \u03a90 by \u03a9\u03b5 in\nLemma 3.3, we can find a complete metric g on \u03a9\u03b5 and a suitable function \u03be : \u03a9\u03b5 \u2192 R, of\nthe form \u03be = \u03bb(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03b5), with the properties stated in that lemma. By Proposition 2.2 we have\n(3.7)\n\n0,2\n0,1\n0,1\n0,0\nKer(\u2202 : L2,\u03be\n(\u03a9\u03b5 )) = H\u03be0,1 (\u03a9\u03b5 , g) \u2295 Im(\u2202 : L2,\u03be\n(\u03a9\u03b5 )),\n(\u03a9\u03b5 ) \u2192 L2,\u03be\n(\u03a9\u03b5 ) \u2192 L2,\u03be\n\nand\ndim(H\u03be0,1 (\u03a9\u03b5 , g)) < \u221e.\n\n(3.8)\n\nNow, let U be a small neighborhood of p where f is defined, and let \u03c8 be a smooth function\nwith compact support in U , such that \u03c8 = 1 in a neighborhood V of p. Set\nhm = \u03c8/ f m\n\non U and 0 on M rU\n\nand\n\nvm = 0 on V and \u2202hm on M rV .\nIf \u03b5 is sufficiently small, vm is smooth on \u03a9\u03b5 , with compact support (not disjoint from the\nboundary). In particular, as the weight e\u2212\u03be is assumed to be integrable near \u2202\u03a9\u03b5 , vm is in\n0,1\n(\u03a9\u03b5 ). Moreover, we have \u2202vm = 0 on \u03a9\u03b5 . By (3.7) and (3.8), the codimension of the\nL2,\u03be\n0,1\n0,2\n0,0\n0,1\n) in the kernel Ker(\u2202 : L2,\u03be\n) is finite, so that for every m big\n\u2192 L2,\u03be\n\u2192 L2,\u03be\nimage Im(\u2202 : L2,\u03be\nenough, there are constants a1 , . . . , am\u22121 such that v = vm + am\u22121 vm\u22121 + . . . + a1 v1 belongs\nto this image. Hence there is a function \u03a6\u2032 such that \u2202\u03a6\u2032 = \u2212v, and by elliptic regularity,\n\u03a6\u2032 is smooth on \u03a9\u03b5 . Set h = hm + am\u22121 hm\u22121 + . . . + a1 h1 and g = h + \u03a6\u2032 . Then \u2202g = 0 on\n\u03a9\u03b5 r { f = 0}, g \u2208 O (\u03a90) \u2229C\u221e (\u03a90 r {p}), and the function \u03a6 in the lemma is equal to \u03a6\u2032\non V .\n\u0003\n\nWe can now prove Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Let us consider a strictly plurisububharmonic function \u03c6 as in Consequence 3.2. Let \u03b5 \u2208 (0, c) be sufficiently small. By Lemma 3.4, we can construct peak holomorphic functions for each point of \u2202\u03a9\u03b5 = {\u03c6 = \u03b5}. Using this fact, it is shown in [MD02,\nProposition 3.1] that if \u03b4 > 0 is sufficiently small, the holomorphic functions on {\u03c6 < \u03b5}\nseparate points and give local coordinates on {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03c6 < \u03b5}. By the method of [AS70,\nProposition 3.2] (see also [MD02, \u00a73]) there exists a compact Stein space S with boundary\n(and with at most isolated singularities) and an embedding of {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03c6 < \u03b5} as an open\nset in S such that \u2202S = {\u03c6 = \u03b5}. By gluing {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03c6 < c} with S along {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03c6 < \u03b5}\nwe obtain a Stein space S\u2032 with boundary {\u03c6 = c}. Using [Heu86, Theorem 0.2] (see also\n\n\fEMBEDDABILITY OF SOME STRONGLY PSEUDOCONVEX CR MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nOhsawa [Ohs84]) the space S\u2032 can be embedded as a domain with boundary in a larger Stein\nspace S\u2032\u2032 such that \u2202S\u2032 is a hypersurface in S\u2032\u2032 . By the embedding theorem of RemmertBishop-Narasimhan [Nar60], S\u2032\u2032 admits a proper holomorphic embedding in CN for some\nN. Restricting this embedding to \u2202S\u2032 = {\u03c6 = c} = \u2202M we obtain the conclusion of the theorem.\n\u0003\n4. C OMPACTIFICATION\n\nOF MANIFOLDS WITH PINCHED NEGATIVE CURVATURE\n\nLet us first of all review some standard facts about manifolds with pinched negative curvature (see the works Eberlein [Ebe80] and Heintze-Im Hof [HIH77], or the book [BGS85]).\nThus, let (X , g) be any complete manifold with pinched negative sectional curvature \u03c3, that\nis, we assume that there are positive constants a and b such that\n\u2212b2 6 \u03c3 6 \u2212a2 < 0.\nFor a compact subset K of X , an unbounded connected component of X r K is called an\nend of X (with respect to K). If K1 \u2282 K2 are two compact subsets, the number of ends with\nrespect to K1 is at most the number of ends with respect to K2 , so that we can define the\nnumber of ends of X . Namely, X is said to have finitely many ends if for some integer k,\nand for any K \u2282 X , the number of ends with respect K is at most k. The smallest such k is\ncalled the number of ends of X , and then there exists K0 \u2282 X such that the number of ends\nwith respect to K0 is precisely the number of ends of X . If no such k exists, we say that X\nhas infinitely many ends.\nLet E be an end of X , and assume that E has finite volume. E is called a cusp and is\ndiffeomorphic to a product (0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03a3 where \u03a3 is a connected closed manifold. The slices\n{t} \u00d7 \u03a3 are the level sets of a Busemann function r associated to E. Moreover, the metric\nrestricted to E is given by\ng|E = dr2 + hr ,\nwhere hr is a family of metrics on \u03a3. Finally, standard Jacobi field estimates show that for\nall r, we have e\u2212br h0 6 hr 6 e\u2212ar h0 .\nProof of Theorem 1.2. For the proof of 1), we shall prove that the hypothesis of Theorem 1.1\nare fullfiled.\nLet U be a neigbourhood of \u2202M such that M r U has finite volume. Then M r U has\nfinitely many ends, each of them being a cusp.\nUsing the Busemann functions associated to each of these cusps, it is shown for example\nin [Yeg04, Lemma 3.2] that the K\u00e4hler form of the metric is d(bounded) on each cusp. Let\nus explain the details of the construction. Let E be a cusp of M, and let r be a Busemann\nfunction associated to E such that E is diffeomorphic to a product (0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03a3, with \u03a3 a closed\nconnected manifold. Let \u03c6t be the flow of the gradient \u2207r of r. If x = (s, y) is a point of\n(0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03a3, we simply have\n\u03c6t (s, y) = (s + t, y).\nThe properties of the differential of this flow are well understood. First, for x \u2208 E, we have\ndx \u03c6t (\u2207r(x)) = \u2207r(\u03c6t (x)). Let u be a tangent unitary vector at x, and orthogonal to \u2207r. Then\nt \u2192 dx \u03c6t (u) is a stable Jacobi field along the geodesic t \u2192 (s + t, y), orthogonal to \u2207r, and\nis equal to u at t = 0. As the sectional curvature is less than or equal to \u2212a2 , the classical\nestimates on Jacobi fields [HIH77] show that\n|dx \u03c6t (u)| 6 e\u2212at .\n\n\f8\n\nG. MARINESCU AND N. YEGANEFAR\n\nNow, if \u03c9 is the K\u00e4hler form of the metric, it is closed, so that by Cartan formula, we have\n\u03c6t\u2217 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 = d\n\nZ t\n0\n\n\u03c6\u2217s (i\u2207r \u03c9) ds.\n\nBy using the estimate of the differential of \u03c6t , we can take the limit as t goes to infinity and\nget that \u03c9 = d\u03b7 on the cusp E, with\n\u03b7=\u2212\n\nZ \u221e\n0\n\n\u03c6\u2217s (i\u2207r \u03c9) ds.\n\nThe same estimate imply that \u03b7 is bounded.\n\u2217\nFrom Proposition 2.3 it follows that (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 is Fredholm in bidegree (0, 1). By Theorem\n1.1 this achieves the proof of 1).\nWe consider conclusion 2). The first observation is that M can be compactified, which allows the use of the extension theorem of Kohn-Rossi. Indeed, let E1 , . . ., Em be the cusps of\nM rU . We fix some end E j and consider the associated Busemann function r : E j \u2192 (0, \u221e).\nIt follows from [SY82, Proposition 1] that \u2212r : E j \u2192 (\u2212\u221e, 0) is a strictly plurisubharmonic\nproper function (note that for the Busemann function, Siu and Yau use the opposite sign convention). From Lemma 3.4 for \u03a90 = {\u2212r < c}, c < 0, we infer as in the proof of Theorem\n1.1 that each strip {c < \u2212r < 0} can be compactified to a Stein space with isolated singularities S j,c. By the uniqueness of the Stein completion [AS70, Corollary 3.2] all spaces S j,c ,\nc < 0, are biholomorphic to a fixed Stein space S j . Letting c \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we see that E j is biholomorphic to an open set of S j . Therefore all ends of M rU , and together with them also M,\ncan be compactified.\nIn particular, the Kohn-Rossi theorem [KR65] shows that every holomorphic function\ndefined in a neighborhood of \u2202M extends to a holomorphic function on M. As a by-product\nwe obtain that \u2202M is connected.\nThe next step is to glue M to a pseudoconcave projective manifold. Since \u2202M is embeddable in CN we can apply [Lem95, Theorem 1.2] which allows to assume that the Stein space\nS\u2032\u2032 constructed in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is an open set in an affine algebraic variety, hence\nalso in a projective variety X . We use now the notations from the proof of Theorem 1.1. We\nset N = {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03c6 6 c} and glue the manifolds M and (X r S\u2032 ) \u222a N along N. The resulting\nb Hence M is a domain with compact strongly pseudoconvex\nmanifold will be denoted by M.\nb\nboundary in M.\nSince S\u2032\u2032 is an affine space in some CN , we can regard the embedding of N \u2032 = {\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b4 <\n\u03c6 < \u03b5} in X as a map with values in CN . Now M can be compactified to a compact strongly\npseudoconvex domain, so the extension theorem of Kohn-Rossi, applied to the components\nof this embedding, show that the embedding extends to a holomorphic map from M to CN \u2282\nPN .\nPulling back the hyperplane line bundle of PN through this map, we obtain a line bundle\nb which is semi-positive on M\nb and positive on (X r S\u2032 ) \u222a N.\nE \u2192M\nb which agrees with the\nA partition of unity argument delivers a Hermitian metric on M\noriginal metric \u03c9 of Int M on say {\u03c6 < \u03b5}. With respect to this metric the canonical bundle\nb for k sufficiently\nof M is positive on {\u03c6 < \u03b5}. Hence, the bundle L = E k \u2297KMb is positive on M\n\u221a\nlarge. Moreover, the curvature \u22121\u0398(L) of L dominates \u03c9 on {\u03c6 < \u03b5} and therefore \u0398(L)\nb The L2 estimates of H\u00f6rmander-Andreotti-Vesentini [Dem01]\nis a complete metric on M.\n0\nb\nproduce sections of \u2295\u03bd H (L\u03bd \u2297 KMb ) that separate points and give local coordinates on M.\nb is 1-concave in the sense of Andreotti-Grauert (we use\nOn the other hand the manifold M\nagain the plurisuperharmonicity of the Busemann function on each cusp). Therefore, the\nembedding theorem of Andreotti-Tomassini [AT70] implies that the ring \u2295\u03bd H 0 (L\u03bd \u2297 KMb )\n\n\fEMBEDDABILITY OF SOME STRONGLY PSEUDOCONVEX CR MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nb in some projective space PN .

Hence the universal covering of M is Stein. It is then shown\nin [SY82, \u00a7 4] (using the Schwarz-Pick Lemma of Yau) and in [MD02, Theorem 1.3] (using\ne r M is an exceptional analytic set in the sense of Grauert [Gra62,\nWermer's theorem) that M\nDefinition 3, p. 341].\ne r(X rS\u2032 )\nMore precisely, let us consider the compact strongly pseudoconvex domain V = M\nwhich compactifies M.

Here V \u2032 is a normal Stein space with at most\ne r M) = \u03c0(V r M) is a subset of SingV \u2032 and each point of\nisolated singularities. Then \u03c0(M\ne r M) compactifies one of the ends E1 , . . . , Em of M rU . Thus M\ne r M consists of those\n\u03c0(M\ne r M).\ncomponents of A obtained by blowing-up points in \u03c0(M\n\u0003\n\nProof of Corollary 1.3. As is well known, the limit set \u039b is the set of accumulation points\nof any orbit \u0393 * x, x \u2208 B, and is a closed \u0393-invariant subset of the sphere at infinity \u2202B. The\ncomplement \u2202B r \u039b is precisely the set of points at which \u0393 acts properly discontinuously,\nand the space M \u222a (\u2202B r \u039b)/\u0393 is a manifold with boundary (\u2202B r \u039b)/\u0393 (see for example\n[EO73, \u00a710]). A is a compact subset of this boundary, hence there is a neighborhood E\nof A in M which is diffeomorphic to the product A \u00d7 (0, 1). It follows that E is an end\nof M, because A is compact and connected. Actually, E is a strongly pseudoconvex end,\nin the sense that its boundary A at infinity is strictly pseudoconvex. Since M = B/\u0393 is a\ncomplete manifold with sectional curvature pinched between \u22124 and \u22121, Corollary 1.3 is an\nimmediate consequence of Theorem 1.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1. By [NR98, Theorem 4.2] the following holds:\nTheorem (Burns, Napier-Ramachandran). Let \u0393 be a torsion-free discrete group of automorphisms of the unit ball B in Cn with n > 3 and let M = B/\u0393. Assume that the limit set\n\u039b is a proper subset of \u2202B and that the quotient (\u2202B r \u039b)/\u0393 has a compact component A.\nThen M has only finitely many ends, all of which, except for the unique end corresponding to\nA, are cusps. In fact, M is diffeomorphic to a compact manifold with boundary and can be\ncompactified.\nThe proof is based on [NR98, Theorem 4.1] which shows that the finite volume hypothesis\nof Corollary 1.3 is automatically satisfied in the case n > 3. The presence of the strongly\npseudoconvex boundary forces the volume to be finite, since \u2202M is then embeddable by\n[BdM75], having real dimension at least 5.\nIf n = 2 we have to assume the volume to be finite in order to obtain the embedding of\nthe boundary. It is interesting to ask whether Burns' theorem holds also in dimension 2 or,\nequivalently, whether the compact strongly pseudoconvex component of a set (\u2202B r \u039b)/\u0393 is\nembeddable for all torsion-free discrete groups of automorphisms of the unit ball B in C2 .\n5. E MBEDDING\n\nOF\n\nS ASAKIAN 3\u2212MANIFOLDS\n\n5.1. Sasakian manifolds. In this section, we explain some well known facts about Sasakian\nmanifolds. Let X be a strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold, with compactible complex structure J, and compactible contact form \u03b8. This allows us to define a Riemannian metric g\u03b8 on\n\n\f10\n\nG. MARINESCU AND N. YEGANEFAR\n\nX given by\ng\u03b8 (., .) = d\u03b8(., J.) + \u03b8(.)\u03b8(.).\nLet R be the Reeb vector field associated to \u03b8, defined by\niR \u03b8 = 1, iR d\u03b8 = 0.\nAssociated to the data (X , \u03b8, R, J, g\u03b8), there is a canonical connection \u2207 on T X , called the\nWebster connection (see Tanaka [Tan75] and Webster [Web78]), which is the unique affine\nconnection on T X such that\n(1) \u2207g\u03b8 = 0, \u2207J = 0, \u2207\u03b8 = 0.\n(2) For any u, v in the Levi distribution H, the torsion T of \u2207 satisfies T (u, v) = d\u03b8(u, v)R\nand T (R, Ju) = JT (R, u)\nIn particular, the torsion of the Webster connection cannot vanish identically. However, we\nhave the following definition\nDefinition 5.1. A strictly pseudoconvex manifold is called a Sasakian manifold if the torsion\nof its Webster connection in the direction of the Reeb vector field vanishes, i.e. T (R, .) = 0\nwith the notations above.\nExamples of compact Sasakian manifolds are the unit sphere in Cn or the Heisenberg\nnilmanifold (see Urakawa [Ura93]). Sasakian 3-manifolds were classified up to diffeomorphism by H. Geiges [Gei97]. They were further studied by F. Belgun in [Bel01]: every\nSasakian 3\u2212manifold is obtained as a deformation of some standard model (see [Bel01] for\nmore details).\n5.2. Asymptotically complex hyperbolic manifolds. In [BH02], O. Biquard and M. Herzlich consider a class of manifolds which are modelled on the complex unit ball, and are thus\ncalled asymptotically complex hyperbolic. This construction will allow us to get an embedding theorem for Sasakian manifolds, but let us first recall what an asymptotically complex\nhyperbolic manifold is.\nLet X be a (2m \u2212 1)\u2212dimensional compact manifold, m > 2. We assume that X has a\nstrongly pseudoconvex CR-structure. Let \u03b8 be a compatible contact form, and J a compatible\nalmost complex structure. \u03b3(., .) := d\u03b8(., J.) is then a metric on the contact distribution.\nFollowing Biquard and Herzlich [BH02], we endow \u03a9 := (0, \u221e) \u00d7 X with the metric\n(5.1)\n\ng = dr2 + e\u22122r \u03b82 + e\u2212r \u03b3.\n\nActually, in [BH02], the authors consider the metric dr2 + e2r \u03b82 + er \u03b3 on \u03a9, but the reason\nfor our choice will become clear later.\nWe can extend the almost complex structure to act on the whole tangent bundle as follows.\nConsider the Reeb vector field R and define\nJ\u2202r = er R,\nwhere \u2202r is the unit vector field in the r direction. g is then a Hermitian metric with respect\nto J, i.e. J is an g\u2212isometry. The fundamental 2\u2212form associated to g is\n(5.2)\n\n\u03c9 = d(e\u2212r \u03b8).\n\nAlthough \u03c9 is a closed form, in this general setting, ((0, \u221e) \u00d7X , g) is not necessarily a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold, because J is not necessarily an integrable almost complex structure. Indeed, the\nproof of [BH02, Proposition 3.1] shows that J is integrable if and only if the torsion of the\nWebster connection of (X , \u03b8) in the direction of the Reeb vector field vanishes identically,\ni.e. if and only if X is a Sasakian manifold (see Definition 5.1).\n\n\fEMBEDDABILITY OF SOME STRONGLY PSEUDOCONVEX CR MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\nFrom now on, X will be a Sasakian manifold, so that (\u03a9, g) is a K\u00e4hler manifold. Note that\n\u03b7 := e\u2212r \u03b8 is a bounded 1\u2212form, hence the K\u00e4hler form (5.2) associated to g is d(bounded).\n\u2217\nIn particular, by Proposition 2.3, the operator (\u2202 + \u2202 )2 on (\u03a9, g) is Fredholm in bidegree\n(0, 1) if dimR X > 3. Moreover, we can also write\n\u221a\n\u03c9 = \u22122 \u22121\u2202\u2202r,\nso that \u03a9 has a stromgly pseudoconvex boundary {0} \u00d7 X (this explains the choice of sign\nof the r variable for g in (5.1): with our choice, \u03a9 has a strongly pseudoconvex boundary, whereas with the choice of [BH02] \u03a9 has a strongly pseudoconcave boundary). From\nTheorem 1.1 we can conclude:\n\nTheorem 5.2. Let X be a Sasakian manifold of dimension at least 3. Then there is a CR\nembedding of X in CN for some integer N.\nRemark. The function \u2212r : \u03a9 \u2192 (\u2212\u221e, 0) is a proper smooth strictly plurisubharmonic\nfunction. Therefore \u03a9 is a hyperconcave end, and our theorem is also a direct consequence\nof [MD02].\nR EFERENCES\n[And63] A.
