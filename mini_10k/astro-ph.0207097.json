Filippenko4\n\nABSTRACT\nWith a redshift of z \u2248 1.7, SN 1997ff is the most distant type Ia supernova discovered so far. This\nSN is close to several bright, z = 0.6 \u2212 0.9 galaxies, and we consider the effects of lensing by those\nobjects on the magnitude of SN 1997ff. We estimate their velocity dispersions using the Tully-Fisher\nand Faber-Jackson relations corrected for evolution effects, and calculate, applying the multiple-plane\nlensing formalism, that SN 1997ff is magnified by 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 mag. Due to the spatial configuration of\nthe foreground galaxies, the shear from individual lenses partially cancels out, and the total distortion\ninduced on the host galaxy is considerably smaller than that produced by a single lens having the same\nmagnification. After correction for lensing, the revised distance to SN 1997ff is m \u2212 M = 45.5 mag,\nwhich improves the agreement with the \u03a9M = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65 cosmology expected from lower-redshift\nSNe Ia, and is inconsistent at the \u223c 3\u03c3 confidence level with a uniform gray dust model or a simple\nevolution model.\nSubject headings: cosmology: observations - cosmology: cosmological parameters - gravitational\nlensing - supernovae: general - supernovae: individual (SN 1997ff)\nspiral galaxies (#709 and #720 in Table 1) which magnify\nSN 1997ff by only \u223c 0.2 mag, about half of the value estimated by Lewis & Ibata, and close to the upper limit\ninferred by R2001 for these two galaxies from the induced\nshear on the host-galaxy shape and orientation.\nM\u00f6rtsell, Gunnarsson, & Goobar (2001) also tackled this\nproblem using rest-frame B-band and ultraviolet luminosities to infer the masses of the lenses. After performing numerous ray-tracing simulations, they concluded that the\nrange of possible magnifications was too large to obtain a\nfirm value for the distance modulus of SN 1997ff based on\nour current knowledge of the lensing galaxies.\nHere we use the superb photometric and positional information provided by the HDFN to estimate velocity dispersions for the galaxies lensing SN 1997ff using the TullyFisher (TF) and Faber-Jackson relations, and correcting\nfor evolution effects. With this information, we calculate, using the multiple-plane lensing formalism (Schneider, Ehlers, & Falco 1992, hereafter SEF), the magnification of SN 1997ff and the shear induced on the host galaxy,\nwhich is fully compatible with its expected intrinsic shape.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the environment of SN 1997ff, and identifies the\nmain lensing foreground galaxies. The multiple-plane lens\nformalism is discussed in \u00a7 3, while \u00a7 4 presents our estimates of the magnification and shear. Section 5 summarizes our main results and conclusions.\n\n1. introduction\n\nOne of the strongest lines of evidence for an accelerating universe is the observation that z \u2248 0.5 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are \u223c 0.25 mag fainter than predicted by\nan \u03a9\u039b = 0 cosmology (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et\nal. 1999; Riess 2000). However, there are several effects\nsuch as gray dust (Aguirre 1999) or luminosity evolution\n(Drell, Loredo, & Wasserman 2000) that could mimic the\neffect of a cosmological constant.\nRiess et al. (2001, hereafter R2001) have recently concluded that SN 1997ff, one of the two SNe discovered by\nGilliland, Nugent, & Phillips (1999) in the Hubble Deep\nField North (HDFN; Williams et al. 1996), has a redshift\nof z \u2248 1.7, making it the highest redshift probable SN Ia\nidentified so far. (The SN Ia classification is based on the\nnature of the host galaxy, an evolved, red elliptical; also\nthe observed colors and temporal evolution of SN 1997ff\nare most consistent with those of SNe Ia.) This object\nis particularly interesting because at z > 1 the preceding epoch of deceleration causes objects to appear brighter\nthan a persistence of astrophysical effects invoked as alternative hypotheses to explain the SN Ia faintness at z \u2248 0.5.\nR2001 measured a distance modulus for SN 1997ff which is\nmore than a magnitude brighter (1.25 \u00b1 0.32 mag brighter\nassuming the spectroscopic indication of z = 1.755) than\nthe predictions from uniform gray dust or toy evolution\nmodels, disfavoring these alternatives to a cosmological\nconstant.\nLewis & Ibata (2001) stated that SN 1997ff could be\nmagnified by a factor of \u223c 1.4 by two \"elliptical systems\"\nclose to its line of sight. R2001 anticipated a magnification of 0.3 mag from these same sources, in good agreement\nwith Lewis & Ibata. As we see below, these are in fact two\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n2. the lenses\n\nFigure 1 shows the positions of the galaxies around\nSN 1997ff with I814W < 27 mag and r < 15\u2032\u2032 .\nThe coordinates, ID number, and I814W magnitudes\nare taken from the Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto, Lanzetta, &\nYahil (1999) catalog and photometric redshifts have\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, The Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N.

Table 1 lists the\ncharacteristics of the galaxies contributing significantly to\nthe magnification of SN 1997ff. The B and I absolute magnitudes MB and MI have been estimated from the I814W\nand HST/NICMOS F110W and F160W magnitudes, respectively. This was done by generating K-corrections\nbased on their spectral type, drawn from the 4 main Coleman, Wu, & Weedman (1980) galaxy types and two Kinney et al. (1996) starbursts; the K-corrections are . 0.4\nmag in the case of the four strongest lenses.\nThe circular velocities Vc for the late-type galaxies in Table 1 have been estimated using the recent results of Ziegler\net al. (2002), which measure the B-band TF slope and\nnormalization for R < 23 mag, 0.5 < z < 1 FORS deep\nfield galaxies - quite similar, in statistical terms, to our\nlens sample. We assume a relative error of \u03b4Vc /Vc \u2248 1/3\nestimated from the scatter around the best fit in Figure\n3 of Ziegler et al. (2002). These errors are propagated in\nthe calculation of the Einstein radius, etc., and account\nfor most of the uncertainty in the final value of the magnification. As a cross-check, we have also estimated the\nexpected values of Vc usingthe I-band TF relation, as determined by Giovanelli et al. (1997): the results are very\nsimilar to those of the Ziegler et al. (2002) B-band TF.\nTo determine their circular velocities with another\nmethod, we observed galaxies #709 and #720 on 2001\nMay 29 and 30 UT with the Echellette Spectrograph and\nImager (ESI; Sheinis et al. 2002) on the Keck-II 10-m\ntelescope. A slit width of 1\u2032\u2032 was chosen, which gave an\ninstrumental resolution of \u223c 70 km s\u22121 (based on fits to\nthe night-sky emission lines). The spectrum of galaxy\n#709 shows strong, single-component emission lines with\nFWHM = 78 km s\u22121 (corrected for the instrumental resolution). The spectrum of galaxy #720 exhibits doublepeaked emission-line profiles, with a peak-to-peak splitting of 200 km s\u22121 . After correcting for the assumed inclination angles (34\u25e6 for galaxy #709 and 69\u25e6 for galaxy\n#720), we derive circular velocities of 70 and 110 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively. In contrast, the respective circular velocities expected according to the TF relation are substantially higher, \u223c 136 \u00b1 48 and \u223c 175 \u00b1 60 km s\u22121 (Table 1). Although both values are marginally consistent at\nthe \u223c 1.25\u03c3 level, these results, especially in the case of\n#709, seem to support the conclusion of Gillespie & van\nZee (2002) that emission lines from the central regions of\nstar-forming galaxies can underestimate the total circular\nvelocity by a factor of \u223c 2. Hence, we consider the circular velocities derived from the Keck data to be lower\nlimits on the true quantities, and we use the TF estimates\nand their uncertainties in the calculations below. Taking\nthe spectroscopic results at their face value would yield\n\u2206\u03bc = 0.07 mag from the #709\u2013#720 pair alone, which\ncan be considered to be the lower limit on the magnification of SN 1997ff. Note also that this would make the total\nmagnification smaller (by \u223c 0.16 mag), and would further\nstrengthen our cosmological conclusions on gray dust or\nevolution models.\nFor the two early-type galaxies, #694 and #653, we\nuse the Faber-Jackson relation between the halo velocity dispersion and the BJ -band luminosity as defined by\nKochanek (1994, 1996), \u03c3DM = (225 \u00b1 22.5)(L/L\u2217)4 ,\n\nwhere L\u2217 corresponds to BJ = \u221219.9 + 5 log h mag (Efstathiou, Ellis, & Peterson 1988) and h = H0 /(100 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 ). Owing to the redshift of these galaxies, z \u2248 0.9,\nwe expect evolution effects to be considerable (e.g., Treu\net al. 2002; although see also Crampton et al. 2002).\nKeeton, Kochanek, & Falco (1998) studied the properties\nof a sample of 17 lensing galaxies with 0.1 < z < 1, and\nmeasured an evolution rate for the mass-to-light ratio of\nd log(M/LB )/dz \u2248 \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.1 for the cosmological model\nconsidered here. After accounting for this effect, the velocity dispersions of galaxies #694 and #653 become about\nhalf of their value in the absence of evolution.\n3. the lensing equations\n\nBecause of the configuration of the lenses, placed at different redshifts, it is necessary to use the multiple lensplane formalism (SEF) to estimate the magnification and\nshear on the SN 1997ff position. The magnification matrix\nfor N lenses at, in general, different positions and redshifts,\ncan be represented as\n\nA=I\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nAi ,\n\nAj = I \u2212\n\nj\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b2ij Ui Ai ,\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere A1 = I (the identity matrix), the coefficients \u03b2ij\nare distance ratios (\u03b2ij = 0 if all the galaxies are on the\nsample plane), and Ui can be represented as\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos 2\u03c6i\nsin 2\u03c6i\n.\nU i = \u03ba i I + \u03b3i\nsin 2\u03c6i \u2212 cos 2\u03c6i\nIn this equation \u03bai and \u03b3i correspond to the convergence\nand shear induced by each i-galaxy on the source in the\nabsence of other lenses. Assuming that the mass distribution of the galaxies can be well represented by a singular\nisothermal sphere, we have\n\u03bai =\n\n\u03b8ei\n,\n2\u03b8i\n\n\u03b3i = \u2212\n\n\u03b8ei i2\u03c6\ne .\n2\u03b8i\n\nThe Einstein radius \u03b8ei can be represented as \u03b8ei =\n4\u03c0(Vc /c)2 Dis /Ds (Bartelmann & Schneider 2001), where\nVc is the circular velocity, Dis the distance between the\ni-galaxy and the source, and Ds is the distance between\nthe source and the observer. Finally, if the matrix A is\nsymmetric, it can be represented in the usual way as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b31 \u2212\u03b32\nA=\n,\n\u2212\u03b32\n\u03ba\nwhere the total shear is \u03b3 = \u03b31 + i\u03b32 and the total magnification is \u03bc = [(1 \u2212 \u03ba)2 + \u03b3 2 ]\u22121 .\nTo describe the effects of lensing on the shape of a\ngalaxy, we can represent it with the complex ellipticity\n\u03c7 = [(1 \u2212 q 2 )/(1 + q 2 )]ei2\u03c6 , where q = a/b is the axis ratio, 0 < q < 1. Given a reduced shear g = \u03b3/(1 \u2212 \u03ba),\nthe intrinsic ellipticity of the source can be recovered as\n(Schneider & Seitz 1995)\n\u03c7s =\n\n2g + \u03c7 + g 2 \u03c7\u2217\n.\n1 + |g|2 + 2Re(g\u03c7\u2217 )\n\nThe above equations have been implemented as a Python\nmodule which can be obtained by contacting N.

The Magnification\nUsing the above expressions, we find that the lensing\ncorrection to the brightness of SN 1997ff is a magnification\nof \u2206m\u03bc = 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 mag, for an \u03a9M = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65\ncosmology and using the filled-beam approximation to the\nangular distance. Table 1 shows the Einstein radius and\nmagnification \u03bci induced on the position of SN 1997ff by\neach individual galaxy. If we naively multiply all these\nmagnifications, we arrive at a value of 2.5 log(\u03a0i \u03bci ) = 0.31,\nwhich represents only a 10% difference from the multiple\nlens-plane formalism result.\n4.2. The Host Ellipticity\nR2001 estimated that, from the ellipticity and orientation of the host galaxy, the probability of its being magnified by more than 0.34 mag by the galaxy pair #709\nand #720 (the two strongest lenses) is only 18%. Our\nnew result for the total shear is \u03b3 = 0.084, half of the\nvalue expected for an equivalent single isothermal sphere,\nand along the direction perpendicular to the #709 + #720\npair. Given this reduced shear, the host ellipticity is significantly less constraining in providing an upper limit to the\nmagnification; the 90% confidence limits for the magnification are (0.086, 1.37). The cause of this reduced leverage of\nthe distortion constraint is that the shear vectors from the\ngalaxies whose contribution was not considered in R2001\npartially cancel out. The result is that, unlike the magnification (\u223c 0.13 mag), the distortion they induce on the\nSN 1997ff host is very small, and slightly counteracts that\ncaused by the #709 + #720 pair, further reducing the\ntotal shear.\n4.3. Cosmological Constraints\nR2001 measured a distance modulus of m\u2212M = 45.15\u00b1\n0.32 mag, assuming zs = 1.755. After correction for lensing, the new value is m \u2212 M = 45.49 \u00b1 0.34 mag, in excellent agreement with the expected value of 45.68 mag for\nthe \u03a9M = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65 (h = 0.65) universe expected\nfrom the z \u2248 0.5 population of SNe Ia (Riess et al. 1998).\nUsing the preceding calculation to correct the SN 1997ff\ndistance modulus for lensing, we can compare the result to\ntoy models that invoke astrophysical sources of dimming\ninstead of a cosmological constant to match the observations of SNe Ia at z \u2248 0.5. Here we will assume the spectroscopic redshift measurement of z = 1.755 for SN 1997ff\nto simplify the evaluation of the astrophysical dimming\nexpected at a specific redshift. The astrophysical dimming described in R2001 would take the functional form\nof 0.3z mag relative to an empty Universe. At z = 1.755\nthis results in a predicted distance modulus of \u223c46.4 mag\n(h = 0.65). The lensing-corrected distance modulus of\nSN 1997ff is 45.49 mag, smaller (i.e., the SN is brighter)\nthan the astrophysical dimming model by 0.91 mag (reduced from 1.25 mag without the lensing correction). As\ndiscussed by R2001, the fit to the SN data yields nonGaussian and asymmetric uncertainties beyond the 2\u03c3 interval. Returning to the fit from R2001 to the SN data\n(corrected by the slight increase in the distance modulus\nerror due to the lensing uncertainty) yields confidence intervals in the direction of larger distances of +1\u03c3, +2\u03c3,\n\nand +3\u03c3 equal to 0.34, 0.67, and 0.90 mag, respectively.\nWe therefore conclude that the simplest alternatives to an\naccelerating universe appear to be inconsistent with SN\n1997ff at the 3\u03c3 confidence level. However, we caution that\nthe astrophysical model of dimming is naive and before\ntests of astrophysical sources can be considered robust, independent confirmation of this result will be required from\nadditional SNe Ia at z > 1.\nMannheim (2001) has shown that the observations of\nz < 1 SNe can be accommodated within a conformal gravity cosmological model (Mannheim 1992) with q0 = \u22120.37,\nwhich predicts a distance modulus of m \u2212 M = 46.11 at\nz = 1.755. This agrees within 1.8\u03c3 with our new result,\nimplying that more data are necessary to discriminate between this hypothesis and a cosmological constant.\n5. discussion\n\nThe magnification of SN 1997ff, \u03bc \u2248 1.4, is high but\ncompatible with the expectation from simulations. For instance, Barber et al. (2000) find \u03bc > 1.4 for 5% of the\nlines of sight to z = 2. However, we would not attribute\nsuch magnification to a selection effect; the dispersion of\nobserved magnitudes due to lensing is only \u223c0.2 mag, no\nlarger than the intrinsic dispersion of SNe Ia, and it has\nbeen shown to cause negligible selection bias (Riess et al.\n1998).\nIt is unlikely that lensing by large-scale structure could\nsignificantly affect our results. Dalal et al. (2002) show\nthat most of the scatter in the magnification comes from\nscales of less than 1\u2032 , corresponding to the range considered\nhere. The expected residual root-mean-square on larger\nscales is \u223c 0.07 mag, smaller than our uncertainty. It is\nnoteworthy that by combining an \"individual lenses\" approach like the one followed here, with a shear analysis\nwhich estimates the large-scale magnification as proposed\nby Dalal et al., it could be possible to significantly reduce the uncertainty in supernova distances due to lensing.\nDark haloes (without optically visible galaxies) may be a\npossible problem with this approach, but so far there is\nvery little, if any, evidence for their existence. The major\nsource of error in our calculations is the dispersion in the\nTF and Faber-Jackson relations at high redshift, but in\nthe future improved calibrations using near-infrared data\nshould reduce this scatter considerably.\nThe amount of magnification we expect for SN 1997ff is\nsimilar to the values determined by Lewis & Ibata (2001)\nand R2001, and roughly agrees with the results of M\u00f6rtsell\net al. (2001) for realistic values of their input parameters.\nHowever, our use of the multiple lens-plane formalism, individual galaxy K-corrections, and TF and Faber-Jackson\nrelationships, corrected for evolution, provides an estimate\nthat is more accurate and robust than previous work.\nIn summary, SN 1997ff, with z \u2248 1.7, is the highest redshift SN Ia discovered so far. It is shown here\nthat gravitational lensing by nearby foreground galaxies\nis likely to have magnified SN 1997ff by 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 mag.\nDue to the spatial configuration of the foreground galaxies, the shear from the individual lenses partially cancels\nout, and the total distortion induced on the host galaxy is\nless than half of that produced by a single lens with the\nsame magnification. After correcting for lensing, and assuming zs = 1.755, the distance modulus to SN 1997ff is\n\n\f4\ncontend with the effects of lensing.\n\nm \u2212 M = 45.49 \u00b1 0.34 mag, in better agreement with the\n\u03a9M = 0.35, \u03a9\u039b = 0.65 cosmology expected from lowerredshift SNe Ia, but inconsistent with uniform gray dust\nor simple evolution models as an explanation for the dimming of z < 1 SNe Ia at the 3\u03c3 confidence level. It is noteworthy that our new result also agrees within 1.8\u03c3 with\nthe predictions of conformal gravity cosmological models\n(Mannheim 2001).\nSince the study of high-z SNe Ia cannot avoid the effects\nof gravitational lensing, future use of SNe to constrain cosmological parameters will need to consider and ultimately\n\nThe authors thank John Blakeslee for useful comments\nand suggestions.
