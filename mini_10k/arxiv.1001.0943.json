The\nemergence of large-scale social and communication\nnetworks and more affordable long distance travel generated\nhighly complex connectivity patterns among individuals in\nlarge scale human populations. Although geographic\nproximity still dominates human activities, they can no\nlonger be characterised by local interactions only.

The\ndefinition and quantification of meaningful geographic\nborders is particularly difficult in this intermediate regime of\n\nwij and fi .\n\nstrong local and significant long distance interactions. Two\nplausible scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 1a, which shows the\nlong range traffic flux between large cities A, B and C and\nlocal traffic within their respective geographic\nneighbourhoods. Taking traffic intensity as a measure of\neffective proximity, then depending on the ratio of local vs.\nlong range traffic, two structurally different subdivisions\ncould be meaningful. If short range traffic outweighs the\nlong range traffic, local, spatially coherent subdivisions are\nmeaningful. If long-range traffic dominates, subdividing into\na single, spatially de-coherent urban community and three\ndisconnected suburban modules is appropriate and effective\ngeographic borders are difficult to define. Although previous\nstudies identified community structures in long range\nmobility networks based on topological connectivity\nalone20,21, this example illustrates that the precise interplay\nof mobility on all spatial scales as well as traffic intensity\nmust be taken into account.\n\n2/9\n\n\fFigure 2: Effective subdivisions and borders in the\nUnited States. a, Subdivisions determined by\nmaximising modularity Q yielding (top to bottom)\n\nQ = 0.6807, 0.6808 and 0.6804 and k = 14 (the\nsame for all three). b, Distribution of k\nand\nconditional distribution of Q for 1000 subdivisions\n(ensemble mean\n\nQ = 0.674 \u00b1 0.0026\n\nstandard\n\ndeviations here and throughout). c, Distribution of\nlinear extensions of states (mean 329 \u00b1 125 km)\nand effective subdivision sizes ( 644 \u00b1 215 km). d,\nEmergence of effective borders by linear\nsuperposition of all maps in the ensemble (blue\nlines).

We\nconstruct a proxy network for human mobility from the\nmovements of 8.97 million bank notes in the United States.\nMovement data was collected at the online bill-tracking\n\nsystem wheresgeorge.com. This dataset is more than an\norder of magnitude larger than one used in a previous\nstudy11. The network comprises 3,109 vertices representing\nthe individual counties of the continental United States, and\nspans distances from 50 km (approximate average size of a\ncounty) to 3,000 km (linear extension of the US). The\nnetwork is defined by the flux matrix W whose elements\n3/9\n\n\fwij \u2265 0 (link weights) quantify the number of bills exchanged\nbetween counties i and j per unit time. W is a symmetric\nweighted network. This strongly heterogeneous multi-scale\nmobility network is depicted in Fig. 1b showing that human\nmobility patterns are characterised by substantial short\ndistance and significant long distance travel.\nBased on the notion that two counties i and j are\neffectively proximal if wij is large, we can use networktheoretic techniques22 to identify a partition P of the nodes\ninto k modules M n such that the intra-connectivity of the\nmodules in the partition is high and inter-connectivity\nbetween them is low as compared to a random null model.\nA standard measure of the amount of community structure\ncaptured by a given partition P is the modularity Q(P)\ndefined\n\nas23,24\n\nQ = \u2211 \u0394Fn\n\n(1)\n\nn\n\nin which \u0394Fn = Fn \u2212 Fn0 is the difference between Fn , the\nfraction of total mobility within the module M n , and the\nexpected fraction Fn0 of a random network with an identical\nweight distribution p( f ) . Q cannot exceed unity; high\nvalues indicate that a partition successfully groups nodes\ninto modules, whereas random partitions yield Q \u2248 0 . For\nlarge networks maximising Q can only be performed\napproximately due to combinatorial explosion in the number\nof possible partitions. A variety of algorithms have been\n\ndeveloped to systematically explore and sample the space of\ndivisions in order to identify high-modularity partitions21.\nWe apply an approximate, stochastic Monte-Carlo method\n(see also Supplementary Information) to find the optimal\nmodular subdivision of the multi-scale mobility network by\nmaximising the modularity. It has been pointed out that\ninvestigating ensembles of high- Q subdivisions can convey\nbetter information of network structure, particularly for\nlarge networks where many different subdivisions exhibit\nsimilarly high values of Q . We therefore compute an\nensemble of 1,000 divisions P that all exhibit high\nmodularity (i.e. Q = 0.6744 \u00b1 0.0026 ). Fig. 2a depicts the\ngeographic representation of three sample partitions we find\n( Q = 0.6807, 0.6806 and 0.6804 ) all comprising k = 14\nmodules. Note that, although modularity only takes into\naccount the structure of the weight matrix W and is\nexplicitly blind to the geographic locations of nodes, the\neffective large-scale modules are spatially compact in every\nsolution. Consequently, although long distance mobility\nplays an important role, the massive traffic along short\ndistances generates spatial coherence of community patches\nof mean linear extension l = 633 \u00b1 250 km. Comparing these\nterritorial subdivisions we note that although the modules in\neach map are spatially compact, possess almost identical\nmodularity, and contain similar building blocks, they differ\nsubstantially in the set of modules they identify. It thus\nseems questionable to associate any quantitative meaning to\nindividual patches and their borders; rather, this observation\nindicates that modularity may not be a useful order\nparameter for weighted, multi-scale mobility networks.\nHowever, a linear superposition of the set of maps exposes a\n4/9\n\n\fFigure 3: Borders in long distance subnetwork and gravity\nmodel. a, A subnetwork without short distance mobility ( d < 400 km).\n33.2% of the links were removed equivalent to 78.2% of the entire\ntraffic. b, Gravity model network, generated according to Eq.

The superposition not only\n\ncomplex structure of spatially continuous borders that\nrepresent a structural property of the entire ensemble of\ndivisions (Fig. 2d). These borders are statistically significant\ntopological features of the underlying multi-scale mobility\nnetwork. Significance tests were performed using a null\nmodel generated by iterative local modifications of the\nborder network (see Supplementary Information) and in\ngeneral the border network significantly coincides with the\n\nidentifies the location of these borders but quantifies the\nfrequency with which individual borders appear in the set of\nsubdivisions. Note that these borders can effectively split\nstates into independent patches, as with Pennsylvania, where\nthe most significant border separates the state into\nPittsburgh and Philadelphia spheres of influence. Other\nexamples are Missouri, which is split into two halves, the\neastern part dominated by St. Louis (also taking a pieces of\nIllinois) and the western by Kansas City, and the southern\npart of Georgia, which is effectively allocated to Florida.\nAlso of note are the Appalachian mountains. Representing a\nreal geological barrier to most means of transportation, this\nmountain range only partially coincides with state borders,\nbut the effective mobility border is clearly correlated with it.\nFinally, note that effective patches are often centred around\nlarge metropolitan areas that represent hubs in the\n5/9\n\n\ftransportation network, for instance Atlanta, Minneapolis\nand Salt Lake City. We find that 44% of the administrative\nstate borders are also effective boundaries, while 64% of all\neffective boundaries do not coincide with state borders (cf.\nFig. 2d).\nIn order to test the degree to which short range connections\ndominate the structure of effective borders we generate an\nartificial network that lacks short range connections\n(Fig. 3a). Applying the same computational technique to\nlocate and quantify effective spatial subdivisions, we find\nthat removing short distance traffic has profound\nconsequences for the spatial structure and coherence of\ndivisions. We consistently find three independent modules\nthat latitudinally split the US. As these three modules\nremain largely spatially coherent, we conclude that\nintermediate traffic inherits the role of short range mobility\nin generating spatial coherence. Although the removal of\nshort links represents a substantial modification of the\nnetwork, bootstrapping the original network randomly by\nthe same amount (see Supplementary Information) has only\nlittle impact on the border structure depicted in Fig. 2d. We\nconclude that short distance mobility is a key factor in\nshaping effective borders.\nWe also investigate whether the observed pattern of borders\ncan be accounted for by the prominent class of gravity\nmodels 17 , frequently encountered in modelling spatial\ndisease dynamics19. In these phenomenological models one\nassumes that the interaction strength between a collection\nof sub-populations with geographic positions xi , sizes N i ,\nand distances dij =| xi \u2212 x j | is given by\n\nwij \u221d N \u03b1i N \u03b2j dij\u2212 (1+ \u03bc )\n\n(2)\n\nin which \u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03bc \u2265 0 are the parameters. Although their\nvalidity is still a matter of debate, gravity models are\ncommonly used if no direct data on mobility is available.\nThe key feature of a gravity model is that wij is entirely\ndetermined by the spatial distribution of sub-populations.\nWe therefore test whether the observed patterns of borders\n(Fig. 2d) are indeed determined by the existing multi-scale\nmobility network or rather by the underlying spatial\ndistribution of the population. Fig. 3e illustrates the borders\nwe find in a network that obeys equation (2). We generate\nthis network such that the first order statistical similarity to\nthe original networks is maximised, which sets the\np a r a m e te r s \u03b1 , \u03b2 = 1 a n d \u03bc = 0 ( s e e S u p p l e m e n t a r y\nInformation). Comparing this model network to the original\nmulti-scale network we see that their qualitative properties\nare similar, with strong short range connections as well as\nprominent long range links. However, maximal modularity\nmaps typically contain only five subdivisions with a mean\nmodularity of only Q = 0.3543 . Because borders determined\nfor the model system are strongly fluctuating (maps in Fig.\n3e), they yield much less coherent large scale patches.\nHowever, some specific borders, e.g. the Appalachian rim,\nare correctly reproduced in the model. Because the model\nsystem produces significantly different patterns (see\nSupplementary Information for statistics), we conclude that\nthe sharp definition of borders in the original multi-scale\nmobility network and the pronounced spatial coherence of\nthe building blocks are an intrinsic feature of the real multiscale mobility network.\nIn order to validate the structural stability of the observed\npatterns, we developed a new and efficient computational\n6/9\n\n\fFigure 4: Border identification from shortest-path tree clustering. a,\nComparison of borders from modularity maximisation (blue), SPT\nclustering (red) and their overlap (green).

Like\nstochastic modularity maximisation, this technique\nidentifies a structure of borders that encompass spatially\ncoherent regions (Fig. 4b), but unlike modularity this\nstructure is unique. The shortest path tree Ti rooted at\nvertex i is the union of all shortest paths originating at i\nand ending at other vertices. SPTs are determined by the\nstrength of connections in the network, and consequently\nare directly related to the dynamics that the network\nmeasures. The shortest path between two vertices is the\n\nSupplementary Information). This measure indicates the\namount of overlap taken in traveling from random locations\nin the network to the roots of the trees. Identical trees have\na dissimilarity of zero and completely different trees have\nz = N , the number of nodes. In our data the z values range\nfrom 2 to 240 (see Supplementary Information). We use a\nstandard technique known as hierarchical clustering to\ncompute a series of borders and consider a border more\nimportant if it appears earlier in the hierarchy. Unlike\nconventional clustering of the inverse weight matrix which\nrequires adding some noise and produces a hierarchical\nstructure that does not strongly correlate with the input, the\nset of borders computed by our method is an accurate\nrepresentation of the underlying data (see Supplementary\nInformation). In fact, although the method yields a unique\nsequence of topological segmentations, these geographic\nboundaries exhibit a strong correlation with those\ndetermined by modularity maximisation (Fig. 4a).\n7/9\n\n\fThe key advanta ge of this method is that it can\nsystematically extract properties of the network that match\nthe observed borders. A way to demonstrate this is to\nmeasure the frequency at which individual links appear in\nthe ensemble of all SPTs and to represent them as an\neffective network (Fig. 4b). Note that the prominence of\nlinks in this figure is not directly related to their traffic\nweight; instead, more prominent links are more likely to be\nused when traversing the network from one node to another\nby a hypothetical traveler. By virtue of the fact that the most\nfrequently shared links between SPTs are local, short-range\nconnections we see that the SPT boundaries enclose local\nneighbourhoods and that the boundaries fall along lines\nwhere SPTs do not share common features. Note that\neffective catchment areas around cities can be detected with\ngreater precision than modularity (Fig. 4c), although some\nstructures contain a single hub and some contain a 'dipole',\nand the west is detected as effectively a single community.\nBased on our analysis we conclude that considerable\ngeographic information is not only effectively encoded in\nhuman mobility networks, it can be quantified\nsystematically using the techniques presented here. The\nquantitative identification, in particular, of geographic\nborders, and a comprehensive assessment of their\nsignificance will be very important for understanding\ndynamic processes driven by human mobility. We believe\nthat because this general framework is suitable for a wide\nrange of multi-scale human interaction networks for which\nthe underlying effective borders are presently unknown, our\nresults and the present framework may open the door for\npromising, quantitative, comparative investigations of\nnumerous spatially distributed human activity patterns.\n\nBibliography\n1(\nNewman, D.
