In order to generate the vacuum densities we use the conformal relation between the Robertson\u2013Walker and Rindler spacetimes and the corresponding results for a plate moving by uniform proper acceleration through the Fulling\u2013Rindler\nvacuum. For the general case of the scale factor the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is\npresented as the sum of the boundary free and boundary induced parts.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe influence of boundaries on the vacuum state of a quantum field leads to interesting physical\nconsequences. Well known example is the Casimir effect [1, 2, 3, 4], when the modification\nof the zero-point fluctuations spectrum by the presence of boundaries induces vacuum forces\nacting on the boundaries. It may have important implications on all scales, from cosmological\nto subnuclear. The particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of\nthe quantum field, the type of spacetime manifold, the boundary geometries and the specific\nboundary conditions imposed on the field.\nThe Casimir effect can be viewed as a polarization of vacuum by boundary conditions. Another type of vacuum polarization arises in the case of an external gravitational field. In this\npaper, we study an exactly solvable problem with both types of sources for the polarization.\nNamely, we consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for both\nscalar and electromagnetic fields induced by a curved boundary in background of RobertsonWalker (RW) spacetime with negative spatial curvature. In order to generate the vacuum densities we use the well known relation between the vacuum expectation values in conformally related\nproblems (see, for instance, [5]) and the corresponding results for an infinite plane boundary\nmoving with uniform acceleration through the Fulling\u2013Rindler vacuum.\nThe latter problem for conformally coupled Dirichlet and Neumann massless scalar fields and\nfor the electromagnetic field in four dimensional Rindler spacetime was considered by Candelas\nand Deutsch [6]. These authors consider the region of the right Rindler wedge to the right of\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: saharian@ictp.it\nE-mail: rezakord@ipm.ir\n\n1\n\n\fthe barrier. In [7], we have investigated the Wightman function and the vacuum expectation\nvalues of the energy\u2013momentum tensor for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling\nparameter, satisfying the Robin boundary condition on the infinite plane in an arbitrary number\nof spacetime dimensions and for the electromagnetic field. We have considered both regions,\nincluding the one between the barrier and Rindler horizon. The corresponding surface densities\ninduced on the plate have been considered in [8]. The vacuum expectation values of the energy\u2013\nmomentum tensors for scalar and electromagnetic fields for the geometry of two parallel plates\nmoving by uniform acceleration are investigated in [9]. In particular, the vacuum forces acting\non the boundaries are evaluated. In [10] the Casimir energy is evaluated for massless scalar\nfields under Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, and for the electromagnetic field with\nperfect conductor boundary conditions on one and two infinite parallel plates moving by uniform\nproper acceleration through the Fulling\u2013Rindler vacuum in an arbitrary number of spacetime\ndimension.\nA closely related problem for the evaluation of the energy-momentum tensor of a Casimir\napparatus in a weak gravitational field recently has been considered in [11, 12]. In particular, it\nhas been shown that the Casimir energy for a configuration of parallel plates gravitates according to the equivalence principle. In [13] the conformal relation between de Sitter and Rindler\nspacetimes is used to generate the vacuum expectation values of the energy\u2013momentum tensor\nfor a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of a curved brane\non which the field obeys the Robin boundary condition with coordinate dependent coefficients.\nThe Casimir densities for spherical branes in Rindler-like spacetimes have been investigated in\n[14].\nThe organization of the present paper is as follows. In the next section we consider the\nconformal relation between the problems in the RW spacetime with negative spatial curvature\nand Rindler spacetime. The geometry of the boundary is specified. In section 3 the vacuum\nexpectation value of the energy-momentum tensor is investigated for a scalar filed with Robin\nboundary condition. The Casimir densities in the case of the electromagnetic field with perfect\nconductor boundary conditions on the plate are discussed in section 4. The main results are\nsummarized in section 5.\n\n2\n\nConformal relation between the problems in Robertson-Walker\nand Rindler spacetimes\n\nAs a background geometry we shall consider the k = \u22121 RW spacetime with the line element\nds2 = gik dxi dxk = a2 (\u03b7)(d\u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03b3 2 dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03a92D\u22121 ),\n\n(1)\n\nxi = (\u03b7, r, \u03b8, \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8D\u22122 , \u03c6) \u2192 x\u2032i = (\u03b7, \u03be, x\u2032 ),\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b3 = 1/ 1 + r 2 and d\u03a92D\u22121 is the line element on the (D \u2212 1)-dimensional unit sphere in\nEuclidean space.

For the case of the Neumann boundary condition in the RW bulk\n(A = 0) the corresponding problem in the Rindler spacetime is of the Robin type with bAR /BR =\n(D \u2212 1)/2.\nAs before, we shall present the corresponding components in coordinates xi in the form of\nthe sum of purely RW and boundary parts:\nh0RW |Tik [glm , \u03c6] |0RW i = h0\u0303RW |Tik [glm , \u03c6] |0\u0303RW i + hTik i(b) .\n\n(25)\n\nBy using the relations (8) for the purely RW part one finds (for the vacuum polarization in RW\nspacetimes see [5, 15, 16] and references therein)\nh0\u0303RW |Tik [glm , \u03c6] |0\u0303RW i =\n\n2aD [a(\u03b7)]\u2212D\u22121\ndiag (\u22121, 1/D, . . . , 1/D) + hTik [glm , \u03c6]i(an) .\nD/2\n(4\u03c0) \u0393(D/2)\n\n(26)\n\nIn particular, for D = 3 we have [5]\nhTik [glm , \u03c6]i(an) =\n\n(3) H k\ni\n\n\u2212(1) Hik /6\n,\n2880\u03c0 2\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the expressions for the tensors (j) Hik are given in [5]. Now it can be easily checked that\nfor the static case, a(\u03b7) = const, one has h0\u0303RW |Tik [glm , \u03c6] |0\u0303RW i = 0. In the special case of the\npower-law expansion, a(t) = \u03b1tc , with t being the synchronous time coordinate, we find\nh0\u0303RW |Tik [glm , \u03c6] |0\u0303RW i =\n\nc(c2 \u2212 6c + 3) (3c \u2212 4)\n3c\ndiag(\n, 1, 1, 1).\n2\n4\n2880\u03c0 t\n3c \u2212 4\n5\n\n(28)\n\n\f\u221a\nThe corresponding energy density is negative for |c \u2212 3| < 6.\nFor the boundary induced energy-momentum tensor in coordinates x\u2032i the spatial part is not\nisotropic and the corresponding part in coordinates xi is more complicated (no summation over\nl):\nl\nhTll i(b) = [\u03be/a(\u03b7)]D+1 hT(R)l\ni(b) , l = 0, 3, . . . , D,\nh\ni\nl\n1\n2\ni(b) + (\u22121)l \u03a92 sin2 \u03b8(hT(R)1\ni(b) \u2212 hT(R)2\ni(b) ) , l = 1, 2, (29)\nhTll i(b) = [\u03be/a(\u03b7)]D+1 hT(R)l\n\nhT12 i(b) = [\u03be/a(\u03b7)]D+1 \u03a92 sin \u03b8\n\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 r\u03b3\n2\n1\n(hT(R)2\ni(b) \u2212 hT(R)1\ni(b) ).\nr\n\nAs we see the resulting energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal. Note that for the case of the\npower-law expansion the ratio of the boundary induced and boundary free parts at a given spatial\npoint behaves as t4(1\u2212c) in the model with D = 3. Hence, at early stages of the cosmological\nexpansion the boundary induced part dominates for c > 1. In figure 1 we have plotted the\nboundary induced parts in the vacuum energy density (l = 0) and 33 -stress (l = 3) as functions\nof the ratio \u03be/b for D = 3 scalar field with Dirichlet boundary condition. The corresponding\nenergy density is positive in the region \u03be < b and negative for \u03be > b.

In particular, these include the vacuum expectation value of\nthe energy\u2013momentum tensor. In addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum\nfield at a given point, the energy\u2013momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the Einstein\nequations. It therefore plays an important role in modelling a self-consistent dynamics involving\nthe gravitational field.\nIn the present paper we have investigated the vacuum expectation value of the energymomentum tensor for scalar and electromagnetic fields induced by the boundary, defined by\nEq. (9), on background of RW spacetime with negative spatial curvature. For a scalar field the\nRobin boundary condition is imposed and for the electromagnetic field we have assumed that\nthe boundary is a perfect conductor. In order to obtain the vacuum expectation values we have\nused the corresponding results for a plate moving with constant proper acceleration through\nthe Fulling\u2013Rindler vacuum and the conformal relation between the k = \u22121 RW and Rindler\nspacetimes.\nFor the general case of the scale factor we have presented the vacuum energy-momentum\ntensor as the sum of the boundary free and boundary induced parts. The boundary free parts are\ngiven by the standard formulae (26), (27) for a scalar field and by (33) for the electromagnetic\nfield. In the special case of the power-law scale factor the corresponding expressions take the\nforms (28) and (34), respectively. The boundary induced part in the vacuum expectation value of\nk i(b)\nthe energy-momentum tensor is non-diagonal and is given by the expressions (29) with hT(R)i\ndefined by formulae (17) and (31) for scalar and electromagnetic fields in the region \u03be > b. The\ncorresponding formulae for the region \u03be < b are obtained by the replacements I\u03c9 \u21c4 K\u03c9 . In the\ncase of the electromagnetic field the boundary induced energy density is positive (negative) in the\nregion \u03be < b (\u03be > b). For the power-law expansion with a(t) \u221d tc , c > 1, at a given spatial point\nthe ratio of the boundary induced and boundary free parts in the vacuum energy-momentum\ntensor behaves as t4(1\u2212c) in the model with D = 3 and at early stages of the cosmological\nexpansion the boundary induced part dominates.\n\nAcknowledgments\nA.A.S. was supported by the Armenian Ministry of Education and Science Grant No. 119.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.
