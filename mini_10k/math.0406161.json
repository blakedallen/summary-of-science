The integrality obstruction. Let A\u2217 be an arbitrary 1-connected Poincar\u00e9\nduality Q-algebra, with formal dimension m. The smoothing problem we are going\nto look at is the following:\nis A\u2217 isomorphic to a graded algebra of the form H \u2217 (M m , Q), where\nM is a 1-connected closed smooth m-manifold?\nWe shall say that A is smoothable if the answer is yes.\nBy Q-surgery ([12], [2]), we know that A is smoothable, for m 6= 4k. Assume now\nthat m = 4k, and pick an orientation, \u03c9 \u2208 A4k \\ {0}. This gives rise (via Poincar\u00e9\nduality) to a symmetric inner product space over Q, denoted by (A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Q).\n(Here and in the sequel, W (R) denotes the Witt group of the ring R; see [8].) If A\nis smoothable, then clearly\n(1.4)\n\n(A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z),\n\nfor some orientation \u03c9 .\n\nIt turns out that the integrality obstruction from (1.4), for a fixed orientation \u03c9,\nis equivalent to the fact that the quadratic form on A2k associated to *\u03c9 is a sum of\nsigned squares, over Q; see [8, Corollary IV.2.6].\nWhen the signature is zero, the integrality condition is equivalent to (A2k , *) being\nsplit; see [8, I.6\u20137]. In this case, (1.4) is the only obstruction to smoothing; see [12]\nand [2], and also [10, Proposition 3.4]. In the non-zero signature case, additional\nobstructions may appear, see e.g. [10, \u00a74.5] for some simple examples, based on [2]\nand [3].\n1.3. Main results. The smoothing problem described above may be solved by\nusing fundamental Q\u2013surgery results due to D. Sullivan; see [12], [2]. This opens\nthe way for constructing closed manifolds with interesting geometric properties,\nstarting from Q\u2013P DA's (see [10] for applications to geodesics).\nThe difficulties of the smoothing problem stem from the fact that the obstructions\ninvolve, besides (1.4), delicate conditions on the signature. If A is an arbitrary\nW ACI, we point out a topological interpretation of the signature, in terms of the\ndefining relations of A, thus answering a question of S. Halperin from [5]. We do\nthis in Section 2, by using a basic result on finite map germs, due to D. Eisenbud\nand H. Levine [4].\nIn Section 3, we focus on the integrality obstruction. In Theorem 3.2, we show\nthat (1.4) is the only obstruction to smoothing, for arbitrary Q\u2013P DA's of formal\ndimension 4 or 8. This is no longer true in dimension 12; see Remark 3.3. In\ndimension 8, our proof requires a classical result on sums of four squares.\nAs far as condition (1.4) is concerned, it may be handled, for a fixed orientation,\nby using discriminants and local invariants of nondegenerate quadratic forms over\nQ; see [11]. We give a similar interpretation for (1.4), where A is an arbitrary\nQ\u2013P DA, in Theorem 3.5, by analysing changes of orientation. For odd rank, the\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\n3\n\nanswer depends only on local invariants. For even rank, both local invariants and\ndiscriminant are involved, in general; see Remark 3.6.\nThe results from Section 3 are applied in Section 4. Here, we construct 8\u2013\nmanifolds with interesting properties, starting from W ACI's which are homogeneous (that is, with wi = 2, for all i). The integrality test from Theorem 3.5 is\nillustrated on two families of examples: one with odd rank (see Example 4.4), and\nthe other with even rank (see Example 4.6). The even rank family has the remarkable property that the corresponding test, described in Theorem 3.5 (2), collapses\nto a single, simple, discriminant obstruction.\n2. Signature and degree\nThe signature plays an important role in the smoothing problem described in\n\u00a7 1.2, via the Hirzebruch formula; see [9], [12], [2].\nLet A = Q[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fn ) be an arbitrary W ACI, as defined in \u00a71.1.\nAmong other things, S. Halperin showed in [5, Theorem 3] that A\u2217 is a Poincar\u00e9\nduality algebra (1-connected and commutative), giving thus rise to (A, *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Q),\nfor any choice of orientation, \u03c9 \u2208 Am \\ {0}. At the end of section \u00a79 from [5], he\nraised the following question: is there an explicit way of computing the signature,\n\u03c3(A, *\u03c9 ), in terms of the defining relations of A?\nLet us consider the associated C \u221e map germ,\n(2.1)\n\nf : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rn , 0) ,\n\nhaving as components the defining polynomial relations of A. Since f \u22121 (0) = {0},\nthe degree at 0 of f , deg (f ), is defined, and may be computed in terms of regular\nvalues of f .\nUsing Theorem 1.2 from Eisenbud and Levine [4] (see also [1, p.103\u2013104] and [6]),\nwe may offer the following answer to the above signature problem.\nTheorem 2.1. Let A be an arbitrary W ACI. Let f : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rn , 0) be the C \u221e\nmap germ associated to a system of defining relations for A. Then:\n\u03c3(A, *\u03c9 ) = deg (f ) ,\nfor a good choice of orientation, \u03c9.\nProof. In [4], the authors give a concrete way to algebraically compute the degree\nof a finite map. Namely let us consider Q(f ) = C0\u221e (Rn )/(f1 , . . . , fn ), where C0\u221e (Rn )\nis the ring of germs at 0 of smooth real-valued functions. A map f = (f1 , . . . , fn ) :\n(Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rn , 0) is called finite exactly when the corresponding Q(f ) is a finite\ndimensional real vector space. Consequently 0 is isolated in f \u22121 (0) and this allows\none to consider the topological degree of f . In this set-up ([4, Theorem 1.2]) one\ncan compute the degree of f as the signature of a symmetric bilinear form on Q(f ).\nMore precisely, if we define \u03c9 to be the class of the Jacobian J = det (\u2202fi /\u2202xj ) in\n\n\f4\n\n\u015eTEFAN PAPADIMA AND LAUREN\u0162IU P\u0102UNESCU\n\nQ(f ), it follows from [4, Proposition 4.4(ii)] that \u03c9 6= 0. Pick any linear functional,\n\u03c6 : Q(f ) \u2192 R, such that \u03c6(\u03c9) > 0. A symmetric bilinear form on Q(f ) whose\nsignature gives the degree is given by the following formula:\n(2.2)\n\n< p, q >\u03c6 = \u03c6(pq) ,\n\nfor p, q \u2208 Q(f ) .\n\nThis result may be applied to the C \u221e map germ (2.1), in the following way.\nFirstly, note that the natural algebra map\n(2.3)\n\n\u03a6 : A \u2297 R = R[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2192 R[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(f1 , . . . , fn )\n\nis an isomorphism. Indeed, the surjectivity of \u03a6 easily follows from the fact that\n(x1 , . . . , xn )m+1 \u2282 (f1 , . . . , fn ) (guaranteed by A>m = 0), while injectivity may be\nchecked by a straightforward weight argument.\nWe may now use the isomorphism (2.3) to show that the natural algebra map\n(2.4)\n\n\u03a8 : A \u2297 R \u2192 Q(f )\n\nis an isomorphism as well (and consequently f is a finite map germ). To this end,\nconsider the algebra map\n\u03c4 : C0\u221e (Rn )/(f1 , . . . , fn ) \u2192 R[[x1 , . . . , xn ]]/(f1 , . . . , fn ) ,\ninduced by Taylor series expansion. Since \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03a8 = \u03a6, \u03a8 must be injective. The\nsurjectivity of \u03a8 follows from the well-known fact (see e.g. [7, p.2]) that the ideal\nof k-flat functions (i.e., germs in C0\u221e (Rn ) whose derivatives vanish at 0, up to order\nk) is contained in (x1 , . . . , xn )k+1 , for any k \u2265 0.\nWe infer from (1.3) and the isomorphism (2.4) that the class of J modulo I, \u03c9,\nbelongs to Am \\{0}. This is the desired orientation. Indeed, we may use \u03a8 to identify\nthe algebras A \u2297 R and Q(f ), and then define \u03c6 to be the linear projection from the\ngraded vector space A\u2217 \u2297 R to Am \u2297 R \u2261 R. Since \u03c6(\u03c9) = 1, the Eisenbud\u2013Levine\nformula applies.\nObviously, the bilinear form (2.2) on Q(f ) is identified with the Poincar\u00e9 inner\nproduct on A \u2297 R, *\u03c9 . Our signature formula follows.\n\u0003\n3. Smoothing in small dimensions, and the integrality condition\n3.1. Small dimensions. We begin by showing how the general smoothing problem\nbecomes simpler, in dimensions up to 11.\nTheorem 3.2. Let A be a 1-connected Poincar\u00e9 duality Q-algebra with formal dimension m (not necessarily a W ACI). Assume that m \u2264 11. Then: A is smoothable (in the sense explained in \u00a71.2) if and only if there is \u03c9 \u2208 A4k \\ {0} such that\n(A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z), when m = 4k, and A is always smoothable, otherwise.\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\n5\n\nProof. For m 6\u2261 0 (mod 4) arbitrary, smoothability follows from [12] and [2]. Assume\nthen that m = 4k, with k = 1 or 2.\nWe have to show that A is smoothable, as soon as property (1.4) from \u00a71.2 holds.\nPick an orientation \u03c9 such that \u03c3 := \u03c3(A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2265 0. We know that the Poincar\u00e9\nquadratic form on A2k is a sum of t squares, t \u2265 \u03c3, minus a sum of s squares.\nIf k = 1, then plainly A\u2217 = H \u2217 ((#t CP2 )#(#s CP2 ), Q), for t + s > 0, and A\u2217 =\n\u2217\nH (S 4 , Q), for t + s = 0.\nIf k = 2 and \u03c3 = 0, smoothability is guaranteed by (1.4); see \u00a71.2.\nAssume then that k = 2 and \u03c3 > 0. We claim that if the system\n(\na+b\n=\u03c3\nP\n(3.1)\n25a + 18b = ti=1 \u03b1i2\n\nhas integer solutions, then A is smoothable.\nIndeed,P\nwe may take the following algebraic Pontrjagin classes: q2 = (10a + 9b)\u03c9,\nand q1 = ti=1 \u03b1i xi , where {xi } is the canonical basis of the positive definite part of\nA4 . Set N 8 = a* CP4 + b* CP2 \u00d7CP2 . Using the second equation from (3.1), one may\neasily check that A and N have the same Pontrjagin numbers; see [9]. This implies,\nvia the first equation from (3.1), that the Hirzebruch signature formula holds for A,\nand we are done ([12], [2]).\nWe come back to the system (3.1). If t \u2265 4, the theorem of Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac\u2013\nLagrange [8, II.8] guarantees integer solutions.\nIn the remaining cases, \u03c3 must be 1, 2 or 3, and then (3.1) may be solved as\nfollows:\n\uf8f1\nfor \u03c3 = 1 ;\n\uf8f2 a = 1 , b = 0 and 25 = 52 ,\na = 0 , b = 2 and 36 = 62 ,\nfor \u03c3 = 2 ;\n\uf8f3\n2\n2\na = 1 , b = 2 and 61 = 5 + 6 , for \u03c3 = 3 .\nThis completes our proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.3. The range m \u2264 11 is the best one for which the integrality condition\nalone guarantees smoothability. Indeed, A = Q[x]/(x3 ), with | x |= 6 has the\nintegrality property, without being smoothable. See [10, \u00a74.5].\n3.4. An integrality test. In applications, we will need to check the integrality\ncondition (1.4). This is clearly related to the theory of nondegenerate quadratic\nforms over Q. We thus start by reviewing some relevant facts from [11].\nTo begin with, assume that A is an arbitrary Q\u2013P DA, with formal dimension 4k.\nSet r := dimQ A2k , and choose a Q\u2013basis of A2k . Pick any orientation, \u03c9 \u2208 A4k \\{0},\nand denote by A\u03c9 the matrix of *\u03c9 . Note that A\u03bb\u03c9 = \u03bb\u22121 * A\u03c9 , for any \u03bb \u2208 Q\u2217 . The\ncondition (A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z) translates to the fact that A\u03c9 is equivalent over Q (in\nthe classical sense, see [11, IV.1]) with a diagonal matrix of signs.\n\n\f6\n\n\u015eTEFAN PAPADIMA AND LAUREN\u0162IU P\u0102UNESCU\n\nBy a convenient choice of basis of A2k , we may suppose that A\u03c9 = diag(a1 , . . . , ar ).\nThen the discriminant of *\u03c9 is equal to a1 * * * ar (modulo Q\u22172 ). For each prime number\np, one also has a local invariant at p, denoted by\nY\n\u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) :=\n(ai , aj )p \u2208 {\u00b11} ,\n1\u2264i<j\u2264r\n\nwhere (*, *)p denotes the p\u2013adic Hilbert symbol. From the classification theory ([11,\nIV.3]), we infer that\n(3.2)\n\n(A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z)\u21d0\u21d2 | a1 * * * ar |\u2208 Q\u22172\n\nand \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(2) .\n\nOur next result translates in similar terms condition (1.4), by taking into account\nchanges of orientation.\nTheorem 3.5. Let A be an arbitrary Q\u2013P DA, of formal dimension 4k. Then:\n(1) Assume r \u2261 1(2). For any orientation \u03c9, there is \u03bb \u2208 Q\u2217 such that the\ndiscriminant of *\u03bb\u03c9 is 1 (modulo Q\u22172 ). Supposing that \u03c9 has the property\nthat a1 * * * ar \u2208 Q\u22172 , (1.4) is equivalent to\n\u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) = 1, \u2200 p \u2261 1(2) .\n(2) Assume r \u2261 0(2). Let \u03c9 be an arbitrary orientation. Set \u01eb := sgn(a1 * * * ar ).\nTwo cases may occur:\n(\u2022) r \u2261 0(4) and \u01eb = +1, or r \u2261 2(4) and \u01eb = \u22121. In this case, (1.4) is\nequivalent to\n| a1 * * * ar |\u2208 Q\u22172\n\nand \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(2) .\n\n(\u2022\u2022) r \u2261 0(4) and \u01eb = \u22121, or r \u2261 2(4) and \u01eb = +1. In this case, (1.4) is\nequivalent to\n| a1 * * * ar |\u2208 Q\u22172\n\nand \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(4) .\n\nProof. Part (1). The first assertion is easy: one may take for instance \u03bb = a1 * * * ar .\nAs for the second one, it will follow from (3.2), as soon as the following claim is\nproved: if (A2k , *\u03bb\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z), where \u03bb > 0, then (A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z). To verify\nthis claim, note that the first condition in (3.2) implies that necessarily \u03bb \u2208 Q\u22172 ;\nthis in turn ensures that \u03b5p (\u03bb\u22121 A\u03c9 ) = \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ), for all p (since Hilbert symbols are\nwell-defined modulo squares, see [11, III.1]), and we are done.\nPart (2). If r is even, it readily follows from (3.2) that (1.4) is equivalent to the\nfact that there is \u03bb \u2208 Q\u2217 , \u03bb > 0, having the property that\n(3.3)\n\n| a1 * * * ar |\u2208 Q\u22172\n\nand \u03b5p (\u03bbA\u03c9 ) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(2) .\n\nIt remains to compute the local invariants of \u03bb * A\u03c9 , at odd primes. This may be\ndone as follows. Firstly, one may use the bilinearity of Hilbert symbols ([11, III.1]),\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\n7\n\ntogether with the first property from (3.3), to see that\n(3.4)\n\nr(r\u22121)\n2\n\n\u03b5p (\u03bbA\u03c9 ) = \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) * (\u03bb, \u03bb)p\n\n* (\u03bb, \u01eb)p .\n\n(\u2022) In this case, elementary properties of Hilbert symbols ([11, III.1]) imply that\n(3.4) above reduces to\n(3.5)\n\n\u03b5p (\u03bbA\u03c9 ) = \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) ,\n\nand we are done.\n(\u2022\u2022) Similarly, in this case (3.4) becomes\n(3.6)\n\n\u03b5p (\u03bbA\u03c9 ) = \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) * (\u03bb, \u03bb)p .\n\nNote that (\u03bc\u03bd, \u03bc\u03bd)p = (\u03bc, \u03bc)p(\u03bd, \u03bd)p and (2, 2)p = 1 ([11, III.1]). It follows that we\nmay assume in (3.3) that \u03bb is a product of distinct odd primes, \u03bb = q1 * * * ql . Use [11,\nIII.1] to compute\n(\nl\nY\n1,\nfor p 6= q1 , . . . , ql ;\n(qi , qi )p =\n(3.7)\n(\u03bb, \u03bb)p =\n\u03b5(qj )\n(\u22121)\n, for p = qj ,\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b5(q) denotes the residue class modulo 2 of q\u22121\n, as in [11]. We infer from (3.3),\n2\n(3.6) and (3.7) that (1.4) implies the conditions from our statement.\nConversely, set\n(3.8)\n\n{p = odd | \u03b5p (A\u03c9 ) = \u22121} = {q1 , . . . , ql } .\n\nIf all primes qj appearing in (3.8) above are equal to 3 (modulo 4), then we may\ntake \u03bb = q1 * * * ql , and (1.4) follows, again from (3.3), (3.6), and (3.7). Our proof is\ncomplete.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.6. Let (V, *) be a symmetric inner product space over Q (alias, a nondegenerate quadratic Q\u2013form). For any k, (V, *) may obviously be realized as (A2k , *\u03c9 ),\nwhere the oriented Q\u2013P DA A\u2217 is Q * 1, in degree \u2217 = 0, V in degree \u2217 = 2k, Q * \u03c9\nin degree \u2217 = 4k, and 0 otherwise, with product given by *.\nNote first that the condition (A2k , *\u03bb\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z) may depend on \u03bb \u2208 Q\u2217 . For odd\nr, examples are easy to construct, using the discriminant obstruction from (3.2). For\nr = 2, for instance, a simple example is provided by the quadratic form with matrix\nA = diag(5, 5). Here, (A2k , *\u03c9 ) \u2208 W (Z), while (A2k , *3\u03c9 ) \u2208\n/ W (Z), even though the\ndiscriminant condition from (3.2) is verified.\nNote also that, in general, the local invariants show up in an essential way, in\nour integrality test from Theorem 3.5 Part (2). Indeed, consider the matrix A =\ndiag(1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 10). The associated Q\u2013P DA belongs to case (\u2022\u2022), and satisfies the\ndiscriminant condition therefrom. On the other hand, \u03b55 (A) = \u22121, as readily seen.\n\n\f8\n\n\u015eTEFAN PAPADIMA AND LAUREN\u0162IU P\u0102UNESCU\n\n4. Homogeneous complete intersections\nIn this section, we want to apply Theorem 3.2 to W ACI's, in the nontrivial\ncases, that is, when the formal dimension is 4 or 8. We will restrict our attention\nto homogeneous W ACI's, i.e., those with wi = 2 and | fi |= 2di \u2265 4, for all i.\nBoth conditions are very natural. The first one simply means that each fi is a\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree di . The restrictions di \u2265 2 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are\nimposed to avoid unnecessary redundancies, like Q[x]/(x) = Q.\nIt is straightforward to check that the formal dimension is equal to 4k, with\nk = 1 or 2, precisely in the cases listed below (where d denotes (d1 , . . . , dn ), and\nr := dimQ A2k ); see (1.3).\nFormal dimension 4:\n(I4 ) d = (2, 2) ; r = 2 .\nr = 1.\n(II4 ) d = (3) ;\nFormal dimension 8:\n(I8 )\nd = (2, 2, 2, 2) ; r = 6 .\nr = 4.\n(II8 ) d = (2, 2, 3) ;\n(III8 ) d = (2, 4) ;\nr = 2.\n(IV8 ) d = (3, 3) ;\nr = 3.\nr = 1.\n(V8 )\nd = (5) ;\nNote that, in the general homogeneous W ACI\nQ case, every degree vector, d, may\nbe realized by a smooth manifold. Indeed, H \u2217 ( ni=1 CPdi \u22121 , Q) = \u2297ni=1 Q[xi ]/(xdi i ),\nwith signature 1, when all di 's are odd, and 0, otherwise. One may ask whether\nmore interesting signatures may also arise from smooth manifolds. For instance,\nin case (I8 ) above, the possible (non-negative) values of the signature are 0, 2, 4, 6\n(since r = 6). Our last main result completely clarifies this question.\nTheorem 4.1. All possible values of d and of the signature of homogeneous W ACI's\nwith formal dimension m = 4 or 8 may be realized by smooth manifolds.\nThe rest of this section will be devoted to the proof of the above theorem. The\ncase m = 4 is easy.\nLemma 4.2. Theorem 4.1 is true for m = 4.\nProof. In case (I4 ), | \u03c3 |= 2 or 0, realized by H \u2217 (CP2 #CP2 , Q) = Q[x1 , x2 ]/(x21 \u2212\nx22 , x1 x2 ), and H \u2217 (CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , Q) = Q[x1 , x2 ]/(x21 , x22 ) respectively.\nIn case (II4 ), | \u03c3 |= 1, realized by H \u2217 (CP2 , Q) = Q[x]/(x3 ).\n\u0003\nWe move now to the case m = 8. In the next lemma, we take care of the\nsubcases where the desired manifold may be obtained from known examples, by\ntaking products and connected sums.\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\n9\n\nLemma 4.3. Theorem 4.1 is true for m = 8, in all cases different from (IV8 ),\n\u03c3 = 3, and (I8 ), \u03c3 = 2 or 6.\nProof. If \u03c3 = 0 or 1, one may use products of complex projective spaces, as explained\nbefore.\nCase (I8 ), \u03c3 = 4: H \u2217 ((CP2 #CP2 ) \u00d7 (CP2 #CP2 ), Q) is equal to\nQ[x1 , x2 , y1 , y2]/(x21 \u2212 x22 , x1 x2 , y12 \u2212 y22 , y1y2 ) .\nCase (II8 ), \u03c3 = 2: H \u2217 ((CP2 #CP2 ) \u00d7 CP2 , Q) = Q[x1 , x2 , x3 ]/(x21 \u2212 x22 , x1 x2 , x33 ).\nCase (II8 ), \u03c3 = 4: A = Q[x1 , x2 , x3 ]/(x21 \u2212 x23 , x22 \u2212 x23 , x1 x2 x3 ) is a smoothable\nhomogeneous W ACI, with signature 4; see [10, Proposition 4.6].\nCase (III8 ), \u03c3 = 2: H \u2217(CP4 #CP4 , Q) = Q[x1 , x2 ]/(x41 \u2212 x42 , x1 x2 ).\n\u0003\nTo check the remaining cases, we will use the integrality test from Theorem 3.5.\nCase (IV8 ) will follow from the analysis of the family below.\nExample 4.4. Let A(c), c \u2208 Q, be the graded algebra\nQ[x, y]/(f1 = x3 \u2212 xy 2 , f2 = y 3 \u2212 cx2 y) ,\nwith x and y of degree 2.\nIt is immediate to see that A(c) is a W ACI (homogeneous, belonging to case\n(IV8 )) precisely when {f1 = f2 = 0} = {0} (over C), that is, if and only if c 6= 1.\nThe next lemma completes the proof of Theorem 4.1, case (IV8 ), and illustrates\nthe arithmetic behind integrality condition (1.4).\nLemma 4.5. Let {A(c)}c6=1 be the above W ACI family. Then:\n(1) The absolute value of the signature of A(c) is 2 + \u01eb, where \u01eb = sgn(c \u2212 1).\n(2) A(c) is smoothable \u21d0\u21d2 | c \u2212 1 | is a sum of two rational squares.\nProof. Part (1). It is readily checked that the matrix of the Poincar\u00e9 quadratic form\non A4 (c), with respect to the basis {xy, x2, x2 \u2212y 2} and the orientation \u03c9 = (c\u22121)x4 ,\n1\n1\nis A(c) = diag( c\u22121\n, c\u22121\n, 1). Clearly, the signature of A(c) is as asserted.\nPart (2). To decide the smoothability of A(c), we will use Theorem 3.5(1). Obviously, the orientation \u03c9 satisfies the required discriminant property. Therefore,\n1\n1\nA(c) is smoothable if and only if ( c\u22121\n, c\u22121\n)p = 1, at all odd primes. This equivalent\n1\n1\n([11, III.1]) with ( \u01eb(c\u22121) , \u01eb(c\u22121) )p = 1, at all odd primes and also at \u221e. By Hilbert's\n1\n1\ntheorem (see [11, III.2]), this is further equivalent with ( \u01eb(c\u22121)\n, \u01eb(c\u22121)\n)p = 1, at all\nprimes and also at \u221e.\nThe definition of Hilbert symbols ([11, III.1]) and the Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem\n([11, IV.3]) together imply that this happens if and only if \u01eb(c \u2212 1) is a sum of two\nrational squares. The proof of Part (2) is complete.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\n\u015eTEFAN PAPADIMA AND LAUREN\u0162IU P\u0102UNESCU\n\nThe last case of Theorem 4.1 ((I8 ), \u03c3 = 2 or 6) will be covered by analysing a\nsecond family.\nExample 4.6. Let us consider the family of graded algebras {B(c)}c\u2208Q , with weight\n2 generators, {xi }1\u2264i\u22644 , and defining relations\n(\nx2i \u2212 x24 , for i \u2264 3 ,\nP\n(4.1)\n2\n1\u2264i<j\u22644 xi xj \u2212 cx4 .\n\nIt is easy to see that (4.1) defines a W ACI (homogeneous, belonging to case (I8 ))\nif and only if c 6= \u22122, 0, 6. For c = \u22121, (4.1) defines the signature 6 algebra from [4,\np.24] (which is not smoothable, by Lemma 4.7 below).\nThe next lemma completes the proof of Theorem 4.1. For its proof, we will resort to the integrality test from Theorem 3.5(2). At this point, it seems worthwhile\npointing out that Part (2) of the lemma provides an interesting family of examples,\nwhere property (1.4) may be decided using only the (simple) discriminant obstruction. This simple behaviour cannot be expected, in general; see Remark 3.6.\nLemma 4.7. Let {B(c)}c6=\u22122,0,6 be the above W ACI family. Then:\n(1) The signature of B(c) is 0, \u00b12 or \u00b16.\n(2) B(c) is smoothable if and only if | (c \u2212 6)(c + 2) |\u2208 Q\u22172 .\n(3) For c = \u22123, 2 and \u2212 52 , the algebra B(c) is smoothable, with signature 0, 2\nand 6 respectively.\n\nProof. Part (1). Our first task is to find a Q\u2013basis of B4 (c), and an orientation \u03c9,\nwith respect to which the matrix of the Poincar\u00e9 inner product is diagonal. We will\nbegin with the basis {xi xj }1\u2264i<j\u22644 . Set y := x2i \u2208 B4 (c), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4. We claim that\n(4.2)\n\nx1 x2 x3 x4 =\n\nc2 \u2212 4c \u2212 6 2\ny ,\n6\n\nand\n(4.3)\n\nc\nyxi xj = y 2 ,\n6\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4 ,\n\nso we may take \u03c9 = y 2. Indeed, we infer from (4.1) that\n(4.4)\n\ncyx1 x2 = cyx3 x4 = y 2 + y(x1 + x2 )(x3 + x4 ) + x1 x2 x3 x4 .\n\nAdding all relations of type (4.4), we get (4.2). Using (4.2), (4.3) follows from (4.4).\nConsider now the following basis in the middle dimension 4: e1 = x1 x2 \u2212x3 x4 , e2 =\nx1 x4 \u2212 x3 x2 , e3 = x1 x3 \u2212 x2 x4 , e4 = x1 x2 + x3 x4 , e5 = x1 x4 + x3 x2 , e6 = x1 x3 + x2 x4 ,\nand rescale the orientation to (6\u2212c)(c+2)\ny 2.\n3\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\nWith respect to these data, the intersection\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0\n\uf8ec0 1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 1\nB1 (c) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 0\n\uf8ed0 0 0\n0 0 0\n\n11\n\nform is given by the following matrix:\n\uf8f6\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\na b b\uf8f7\nb a b\uf8f8\nb b a\n\nc(c\u22124)\n2c\nwhere a = (6\u2212c)(c+2)\n, b = (6\u2212c)(c+2)\n; use (4.2) and (4.3).\nFirstly note that if c = 4 i.e. a = 0, the determinant of B1 is positive, so clearly\nthis case cannot produce \u03c3 = 4.\nLet us now consider the case c 6= 4, i.e. a 6= 0.\nConsidering a new basis: fi = ei , i \u2264 4, f5 = e5 \u2212 e6 , f6 = \u22122be4 + ae5 + ae6 , we\nobtain a new matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec0 1 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n\uf8ec0 0 1 0\n\uf8f7\nB2 (c) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\na\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed0 0 0 0 2(a \u2212 b)\n\uf8f8\n0\n0 0 0 0\n0\n2a(a \u2212 b)(a + 2b)\n\nRescaling our last basis to: gi =\nmatrix:\n\uf8eb\n1 0\n\uf8ec0 1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0\n\uf8ec\n(4.5)\nB3 (c) = \uf8ec0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0 0\n0 0\n\nfi , i \u2264 5, g6 =\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\nc(c\u22124)\n(6\u2212c)(c+2)\n\n0\n0\n\n(6\u2212c)(c+2)\nf6 ,\nc2\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22122c\nc+2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22122(c\u22124)\nc+2\n\nwe finally obtain the\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nOur assertion on signature from Part (1) easily follows by examining the distribution of signs on the diagonal of the matrix B3 (c).\nPart (3).

Solve for c and substitute in (4.6), to\nobtain the following values (modulo Q\u22172 ) for \u03bb1,2 :\n(\n\u03bb1 = 2\u01ebt2 \u2212 6s2 ,\n(4.8)\n\u03bb2 = 6\u01ebt2 \u2212 2s2 .\n\u01eb(6 \u2212 c) =\n\nWe are going to compute the Hilbert symbols appearing in (4.7), in terms of\nLegendre symbols; see [11, I.3 and Theorem III.1]. To do this, write\n(\n\u03bb 1 = p\u03b1 u ,\n(4.9)\n\u03bb 2 = p\u03b2 v ,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 N, u, v \u2208 Z, and u, v 6\u2261 0(p).\nTo finish our proof, we are going to show that \u03b5p (B) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(2) (when\n\u01eb = \u22121), and \u03b5p (B) = 1, \u2200p \u2261 1(4) (when \u01eb = +1).\nSeveral cases may appear in (4.9). If \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0, then plainly (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 )p =\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb1 )p = (\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 )p = 1, at all odd primes p. The case \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 cannot occur, since\nthis would imply (see (4.8)) that s \u2261 t \u2261 0(p). The remaining cases (\u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 > 0\nand \u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 = 0) may be settled as follows.\n\u0010 \u0011\u03b2\nFor \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 > 0, one knows ([11, Theorem III.1]) that (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 )p = \u03bbp1 . Since\n\n2s2 \u2261 6\u01ebt2 (p), \u03bb1 \u2261 \u221216\u01ebt2 (p). \u0010\nTherefore,\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 )p = (\u2212\u01eb)\u03b2\u03b5(p) . Similarly, for\n\u0011\u03b1\n\u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 = 0, one has (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 )p = \u03bbp2 , with \u03bb2 \u2261 16s2 (p), hence (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 )p = 1.\nBy (4.7), this completes our proof, when \u01eb = \u22121.\nAssume now \u01eb = +1. In this last case, we will also need (\u03bb1 , \u03bb1 )p = (\u22121)\u03b1\u03b5(p) ,\nand (\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 )p = (\u22121)\u03b2\u03b5(p) . When p \u2261 1(4), both (\u03bb1 , \u03bb1 )p and (\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 )p are 1, which\ncompletes our proof (see (4.7)).\n\u0003\n\n\fMANIFOLDS FROM COMPLETE INTERSECTIONS\n\n13\n\nReferences\n[1] Arnold, V.
