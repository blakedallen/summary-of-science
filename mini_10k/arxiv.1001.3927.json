In particular, the spectral approach which is deeply encoded\nin the notion of a spectral triple, is not only motivated by the algebra of quantum observables\nA acting on the Hilbert space H of physical states, but also by classical physics like general\nrelativity. For instance, a Riemannian compact spin manifold can be reconstructed only via\nproperties of a commutative spectral triple (A, H, D) [19] where the last piece D is a selfadjoint\noperator acting on H playing the role of a Dirac operator which can fluctuates: D is then\nreplaced by DA := D + A where A is a selfadjoint one-form.\nThe spectral action S of Chamseddine\u2013Connes [11] associated to a triple (A, H, D) is the trace\n2 /\u039b2 ) where \u03a6 is a positive function and \u039b plays the role of a cut-off. This can be written\nof \u03a6(DA\n(under some conditions on the spectrum) as a series of noncommutative integrals\nZ\nX\nS(DA , \u03a6, \u039b) =\n\u03a6k \u039bk \u2212 |DA |\u2212k + \u03a6(0) \u03b6DA (0) + O\u039b\u2192\u221e (\u039b\u22121 )\n(1)\nk\u2208Sd+\n\nR\u221e\npart of the dimension spectrum of\nwhere \u03a6k = 12 0 \u03a6(t) tk/2\u22121 dt, Sd+ is the strictly positive\nR\nthe spectral triple and the noncommutative\nintegral\nX\nfor\nX\nin the algebra \u03a8(A) of pseudod\u0001\nR\nifferential operators, is defined by X := Res Tr X|D|\u2212s .\ns=0\nR\nSince is a trace on \u03a8(A) (non necessarily positive), it coincides (up to a scalar) with the\nWodzicki residue [58, 59] in the case of a commutative geometry where A is the algebra of\nC \u221e functions on a manifold M without boundary: in a chosen coordinate system and local\ntrivialization (x, \u03be) of T \u2217 M , this residue is\nZ Z\n\u0001\nX\n(x, \u03be) b|d\u03be| |dx|,\nTr \u03c3\u2212d\nW res(X) :=\nM\n\nSx\u2217 M\n\nX is the symbol of the classical pseudodifferential operator X which is homogeneous of\nwhere \u03c3\u2212d\ndegree \u2212d := \u2212dim(M ), d\u03be is the normalized restriction of the volume form to the unit sphere\nSx\u2217 M \u2243 Sd\u22121 . The Dixmier's trace Tr\u03c9 [23] concerns compact\nP operators X with singular values\n{ \u03bck } satisfying supN \u2192\u221e aN < \u221e where aN = log(N )\u22121 N\nk=1 \u03bck and Tr\u03c9 (X) is defined after a\nchoice of\nan\naveraging\nprocedure\n\u03c9\nsuch\nthat\nTr\n(X)\n=\nlim\n\u03c9\nN aN when aN converges. As shown\nR\nin [18], coincides (still up to a universal scalar) with Tr\u03c9 when X has order \u2212d.\nWhen M has a boundary, the choice of an appropriate differential calculus is delicate. In the\nnoncommutative framework, the links between Boutet de Monvel's algebra, Wodzicki's residue,\nDixmier's trace or Kontsevich\u2013Vishik's trace [42] have been clarified [1,25,32,33,48,52] including\nthe case of log-polyhomogeneous symbols [45].\nFrom a physics point of view, applications of noncommutative\nintegrals on manifolds to classical\nR\ngravity has begun with Connes' remark that D \u22122 coincides in dimension 4 with Einstein\u2013\nHilbert action, a fact recovered in [40, 41]. Then, a generalization to manifolds with boundaries\nwas proposed in [53, 55\u201357]. From the quantum side, a noncommutative approach of the unit\ndisk is proposed in [10].\n\nNevertheless, a construction of spectral triples in presence of boundary is not an easy task,\nalthough a general approach of boundary spectral triples has been announced in [20].\nFirst examples appear with isolated conical singularity in [46], a work related to some extend\nto [44, 51] when the spectrum dimension is computed. The difficulty is to find an appropriate\n2\n\n\fboundary condition which preserves not only the selfadjointness of the realization of D but also\nthe ellipticity. A special case of boundary also appears in non-compact manifolds when one\nrestricts the operator D to a bounded closed region: for instance, this trick was used in [50, 60].\nThe choice of a chiral boundary condition, already considered in [8] for mathematical reasons,\nis preferred in [13] for physical reasons: firstly, it is consistent with a selfadjoint and elliptic\nrealization, and secondly, it is a local boundary condition contrary to the standard APS' one\nwhich is global [2]. Thirdly, it gives a similar ratio and signs for the second term of the spectral\naction (the first one being the cosmological constant), namely the scalar curvature of the manifold\nand the extrinsic curvature of the boundary, as in the Euclidean action used in gravitation [34].\nSince there are a lot of possible choices, this last consideration deserves attention.\nHere, we first show a construction for manifolds with boundary that actually produces a spectral\ntriple, and then give conditions on the algebra of functions on that manifold to get a regular triple\n(remark that the spectral action has only been computed, until now, for spectral triples which\nare regular). While in field theory, the one-loop calculation divergences, anomalies and different\nasymptotics of the effective action are directly obtained from the heat kernel method [26,27,54],\nwe try to avoid this perturbation approach already used in [39] to prove that there are no tadpoles\nR\nwhen a reality operator J exists. Tadpoles are the A-linear terms in (1), like for example AD \u22121 .\nIn quantum field theory, D \u22121 is the Feynman propagator and AD \u22121 is a one-loop graph with\nfermionic internal line and only one external bosonic line A looking like a tadpole.\nIn section 2, we derive a technical result on regularity of spectral triples which is sufficient to\navoid the use of Sobolev spaces of negative order. Then, we recall few basics on the realization of\nboundary pseudodifferential operators and their stability by powers using the Grubb's approach\n[30]. In section 4, we define an algebra APT compatible with the realization of an elliptic\npseudodifferential boundary system { P, T }. A condition on P is given which guarantees the\nregularity of the associated spectral triple. The motivating example of a classical Dirac operator\nis considered in section 4.2. Moreover, the construction of a spectral triple on the boundary is\nrevisited in section 4.3. Section 5 is devoted to a realityR operator J on a spectral triple with\nboundary and some consequences on the tadpoles like AD \u22121 which can appear in spectral\naction.\n\n2\n\nRegularity\n\nLet N be the non-negative integers and B(H) be the set of bounded operator on a separable\nHilbert space H.\nWe shall use the following definition of a spectral triple:\nDefinition 2.1. A spectral triple of dimension d is a triple (A, H, D) such that H is a Hilbert\nspace and\n- A is an involutive unital algebra faithfully represented in B(H),\n- D is a selfadjoint operator on H with compact resolvent and its singular values (\u03bcn (|D|))n\nare O(n1/d ),\n- for any a \u2208 A, a Dom D \u2286 Dom D and the commutator [D, a] (with domain Dom D) as an\nextension in B(H) denoted da.\nNote that Dom |D| = Dom D. We set \u03b4(T ) := [|D|, T ], where A is the closure of the operator A,\nwith domain\nDom \u03b4 := { T \u2208 B(H) : T Dom D \u2286 Dom D and [|D|, T ] has closure in B(H) }.\n3\n\n\fDefinition 2.2. A spectral triple (A, H, D) is said to be regular if A and dA are included in\n\u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4n .\nAs seen in next lemma, it is quite convenient to introduce the following\nDefinition 2.3. Given a selfadjoint operator P on a Hilbert space H, let\nHP\u221e := \u2229k\u22651 Dom |P |k = \u2229k\u22651 Dom P k .\nA linear map from HP\u221e into itself which is continuous for the topologies induced by H is said to\nbe HP\u221e -bounded.\nNote that HP\u221e is a core for any power of P or |P |. In particular it is a dense subset of H and\n|P | is the closure of the essentially selfadjoint operator |P ||H\u221e\n. Note also that for any k \u2208 N,\nP\n2\nk/2\nk\n(1 + P )\nis a bijection from Dom P onto H, and thus, (1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 is a bijection from H\nonto Dom P k . As a consequence, for any p \u2208 Z, the operators (1 + P 2 )p/2 send bijectively HP\u221e\nonto itself, and for any k \u2208 N, |P |k send HP\u221e into itself.\nGiven a selfadjoint P , let \u03b4\u2032 , \u03b41 be defined on operators by\n\u03b4\u2032 (T ) := [|P |, T ],\n\n\u03b41 (T ) := [P 2 , T ] (1 + P 2 )\u22121/2\n\nwith domains\n\u0001\nDom \u03b4\u2032 (resp. Dom \u03b41 ) := { T \u2208 HP\u221e -bounded operators : \u03b4\u2032 (T ) resp. \u03b41 (T ) is HP\u221e -bounded }.\n\nWe record the following lemma, proven by A. Connes:\n\nLemma 2.4. [19, Lemma 13.1 and 13.2].\n(i) If T \u2208 Dom \u03b4\u2032 , then the bounded closure T of T is in Dom \u03b4 and \u03b4(T ) = \u03b4\u2032 (T ).\nSo, by induction, if T \u2208 \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4\u2032 n then T \u2208 \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4n .\n(ii) Let T be a HP\u221e -bounded operator. If T \u2208 \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b41 n , then T \u2208 \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4\u2032 n .\nIn particular the bounded closure T of T belongs to \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4n .\nDefinition 2.5. Given a Hilbert space H and a selfadjoint (possibly unbounded) operator P , we\ncall Sobolev scale on N, a family (H k )k\u2208N of Hilbert spaces such that\n- H 0 = H,\n- H k+1 is continuously included in H k for any k \u2208 N,\n- for any k \u2208 N, Dom P k is a closed subset of H k .\nBy closed graph theorem, the last point implies that P k is continuous from Dom P k endowed\nwith the H k -topology into H.\nSimilar abstract Sobolev scales, defined as domains of the powers of an abstract differential\noperator, have been considered in [36]. A corresponding criterion for regularity has been obtained\nin [36, 4.26 Theorem]. The scale we consider here will correspond in section 4 to the Sobolev\nspaces (on the manifold with boundary) and not to the domains of the powers of the realization\nof a first order pseudodifferential operator. In the case without boundary, these scales coincide.\nWhen T is a HP\u221e -bounded operator, we shall denote T (k) := [P 2 , *]k (T ) for any k \u2208 N.\nLemma 2.6. Let P be a selfadjoint operator and T be a HP\u221e -bounded operator. Suppose that\nthere is a Sobolev scale (H k )k\u2208N such that for any k \u2208 N, T (k) is continuous from HP\u221e with the\nH k -topology into HP\u221e with the H-topology. Then T \u2208 \u2229n\u2208N Dom \u03b4n .\n4\n\n\f\u0001\nP\nProof. The operator (P \u2212 i)k = kj=0 kj (\u2212i)k\u2212j P j is continuous from Dom P k with the H k topology into H. Since P is selfadjoint, P \u2212 i is a bijection from Dom P onto H, and by\ncomposition, (P \u2212 i)k is a bijective map from Dom P k onto H. The inverse mapping theorem\nnow implies that (P \u2212 i)\u2212k is continuous from H onto Dom P k with the H k -topology. Moreover,\n(1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 = (P \u2212 i)\u2212k B where B := (P \u2212 i)k (1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 is, by spectral theory, a bijective\noperator in B(H). As a consequence, (1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 is continuous from H onto Dom P k with the\nH k -topology. In particular,(1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 is continuous from HP\u221e with the H-topology, into HP\u221e\nwith the H k -topology.\n\u0001k\nSo the hypothesis gives that T (k) (1 + P 2 )\u2212k/2 = [P 2 , *] (1 + P 2 )\u22121/2 (T ) = \u03b41k (T ) is a HP\u221e bounded operator. The result follows from Lemma 2.4.\nThe previous lemma essentially implies that, in order to prove the regularity of a spectral triple\n(A, H, D), it is sufficient to construct a Sobolev scale (H k )k\u2208N adapted to H and D, such that\nthe operators D k and T (k) behave respectively as operators of \"order\" k with respect to the\nSobolev scale, when T is any element of A \u222a dA.\nRemark 2.7. By Lemma 2.4, it is possible to obtain regularity without using Sobolev spaces\nof negative order, implicitly used for instance in [29, Theorem 11.1] which follows the original\nargument of [15]. This shall considerably simplify the proof of the regularity of the spectral triple\non manifolds with boundary, since the continuity of realizations of elliptic boundary differential\noperators is usually established on Sobolev spaces of positive order [5,6,9,30].

A commutative spectral triple (A, H, D) provided with a chirality operator \u03c7 (a\nZ/2 grading on H which anticommutes with D) is said to be real if there exists an antilinear\nisometry J on H such that JaJ \u22121 = a\u2217 for a \u2208 A, JD = \u01ebDJ, J\u03c7 = \u01eb\u2032 \u03c7J, and J 2 = \u01eb\u2032\u2032 where\n\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032\u2032 are signs given by the table quoted in [16, 17, 29].\nAs we shall see, it turns out that the existence of an operator J only satisfying JD = \u00b1DJ and\nJaJ \u22121 = a\u2217 is enough to impose vanishing tadpoles at any order. We thus introduce a weak\ndefinition of conjugation operator:\nDefinition 5.2. A conjugation operator on a commutative spectral triple (A, H, D) is an antilinear isometry J on H such that JaJ \u22121 = a\u2217 for any a \u2208 A and JD = \u03b5DJ with \u03b5 \u2208 { \u22121, 1 }.\nIn order to be able to compute\n\u0001 the spectral action and the corresponding tadpoles on the spectral triples APT , L2 (E), PT , we shall need the noncommutative integral and a characterization\nof the dimension spectrum. We first recall a few definitions of the Chamseddine\u2013Connes pseudodifferential calculus [12]. From now on, (A, H, D) is a regular commutative spectral triple of\ndimension d endowed with conjugation operator J.\nWe shall use the following convention: X \u2212s when R(s) > 0 actually means (X + P0 )\u2212s where\nP0 is the orthogonal projection on the kernel of X. Note that in our case, JAJ \u22121 = A, by\ndefinition of J.\nFor any \u03b1 \u2208 R, we define OP \u03b1 := { T : |D|\u2212\u03b1 T \u2208 \u2229k Dom \u03b4k }, where \u03b4 = [|D|, *] as defined in\nsection 2.\nLemma 5.3.

We use here the algebra of pseudodifferential operators defined by Chamseddine\u2013\nConnes in [12] and denoted \u03a81 (A) in [24,39]. This algebra does not a priori contain the operators\nof type |D|k or |D+A|k (A one-form) for k odd, contrarily to the larger algebra considered in [24].\nThe dimension spectrum Sd(A, H, D) of a spectral triple has initially been defined in [15, 22]\nand is adapted here to the definition of pseudodifferential operator.\nDefinition 5.6. A spectral\ntriple (A, H, D) is said to be simple if all generalized zeta functions\n\u0001\nP := s 7\u2192 Tr P |D|\u2212s , where P is any pseudodifferential operator in OP 0 , are meromorphic\n\u03b6D\non the complex plane with only simple poles.
