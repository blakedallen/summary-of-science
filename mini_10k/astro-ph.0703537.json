Estimating the luminosity function from magnitude limited samples is relatively straightforward, provided that the distances to the objects\nin the sample are known accurately; techniques for doing this have been available for\nabout thirty years. However, distances are usually known accurately for only a small\nsubset of the sample. This is true of the objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nand will be increasingly true of the next generation of deep multi-color photometric\nsurveys. Estimating the luminosity function when distances are only known approximately (e.g., photometric redshifts are available, but spectroscopic redshifts are not)\nis more difficult. I describe two algorithms which can handle this complication: one\nis a generalization of the Vmax algorithm, and the other is a maximum likelihood\napproach. Because these methods account for uncertainties in the distance estimate,\nthey impact a broader range of studies. For example, they are useful for studying the\nabundances of galaxies which are sufficiently nearby that the contribution of peculiar\nvelocity to the spectroscopic redshift is not negligible, so only a noisy estimate of the\ntrue distance is available. In this respect, peculiar velocities and photometric redshift\nerrors have similar effects. The methods developed here are also useful for estimating\nthe stellar luminosity function in samples where accurate parallax distances are not\navailable.\nKey words: methods: analytical - galaxies: formation - galaxies: haloes - dark matter\n- large scale structure of the universe\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEstimates of the distribution of distances to galaxies, and\nof the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution, provide\nuseful constraints on models of galaxy formation. Current\n(e.g. the SDSS, York et al. 2000, Combo-17, Wolf et al. 2003,\nMUSYC, Marchesini et al. 2007) and planned surveys (e.g.,\nDES, LSST) go considerably deeper in multicolor photometry than in spectroscopy, or are entirely photometric. For\nsuch surveys, reasonably accurate photometric redshift estimates (e.g. Hyper-z, Bolzonella et al. 2000, and ANNz,\nCollister & Lahav 2003) can or will be made. In the case\nof Luminous Red Galaxies (e.g. Eisenstein et al. 2001), the\nphotometric redshifts may actually be quite accurate (e.g.\nPadmanabhan et al. 2004; Weinstein et al. 2004; Collister\net al. 2006). The number of objects with photometric redshifts typically exceeds the number for which spectroscopic\nredshifts are available by more than an order of magnitude. This is also true of new quasar detection algorithms.\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: shethrk@physics.upenn.edu\n\nWhereas the SDSS will obtain spectra of about one hundred\nthousand quasars, the Non-parametric Bayesian Classification algorithm of Richards et al. (2004) has identified one\nmillion quasars using SDSS photometry. Large photometric\nsamples of galaxies and quasars offer the potential of studying cosmological evolution at a fraction of the cost of a full\nspectroscopic survey.\nBigger is not better only for studying the evolution of\nthe galaxy and quasar populations. In the case of galaxies, the larger number of LRGs with photometric redshifts,\nallowed new science: the detection of the integrated SachsWolfe effect (Fosalba et al. 2003; Scranton et al. 2003; Padmanabhan et al. 2005; Cabre et al. 2006) required the larger\nphotometric LRG catalog. In the case of quasars also, larger\nsample sizes allow one to address new science questions.\nFor example, the SDSS spectroscopic sample is barely large\nenough to measure the gravitational lensing magnification\nbias signal with high statistical significance: the larger photometric sample made the measurement possible (Scranton\net al. 2005).\nWith photometric redshift surveys becoming the norm,\n\n\f2\n\nR. K. Sheth\n\nit is timely to devise methods for estimating the distribution\nof comoving distances and the evolution of the luminosity\nfunction in such samples. Broadly speaking, techniques for\nestimating the luminosity function from a magnitude limited\ncatalog fall into two classes: one is based on the nonparametric Vmax method outlined by Schmidt (1968); the other\nis a maximum likelihood analysis which can provide parametric or nonparametric estimates of the luminosity function (Sandage, Tammann & Yahil 1979; Efstathiou, Ellis\n& Peterson 1988; Springel & White 1998). Both methods\nassume that the distances are known precisely and accurately. The main goal of the present work is to generalize\nboth types of methods to handle photometric redshifts. For\nreasons described below, the analysis which follows is bestsuited to studying objects where evolution and k-correction\nuncertainties are small. In practice, this means they are best\nsuited to catalogs which contain objects of one spectral type.\nRemoving this constraint is the subject of ongoing work.\nSection 2 discusses a deconvolution algorithm for estimating dN/dz and the luminosity function from photometric\nredshift samples. The estimator of the luminosity function\nis a generalization of the Vmax method (Schmidt 1968), and\nthe method uses the deconvolution algorithm described by\nLucy (1974). Section 3 discusses a maximum likelihood approach. Some applications are discussed in Section 4 and a\nfinal section summarizes.\n\n2\n\nC(ze ) = 1 \u2212\n\nThe redshift distribution: dN/dz\n\nLet dN/dz denote the number of objects which lie at redshift\nz (since peculiar velocities are unlikely to be larger than a\nfew thousand km/s, they do not make a significant change to\nthe redshift if z > 0.01). Let p(ze |z) denote the probability\nof estimating the redshift as ze when the true value is z.\nThen the distribution of estimated redshifts is\nZ\ndNe (ze )\ndN (z)\n= dz\np(ze |z).\n(1)\ndze\ndz\nTo get an idea of what this implies, suppose that p(ze |z)\nis sharply peaked around the true value z. Then define\n\u2206z \u2261 ze \u2212 z and expand dN/dz in a Taylor series around its\nvalue at ze . This yields an expansion in \u2206z. If the estimated\nredshift is unbiased in the mean, then h\u2206zi = 0 and the\nleading order contribution is of the form\n \u0328\n \u0328\ndNe (ze )\ndN (ze )\nh\u2206z 2 i \u2202 2 [dN (z)/dz]  \u0328\n\u2248\n+\n(2)\n \u0328\n \u0328\ndze\ndze\n2\n\u2202z 2\nze\n\nTypically, dN/dz is well approximated by a constant times\nz 2 exp[\u2212(z/zm )\u03b1 ], with \u03b1 \u2248 3/2 and zm set by the luminosity function and the limiting magnitude of the catalog (i.e.,\ndN/dz \u221d z 2 at z \u226a zm , and it drops rapidly for z \u226b zm ).\nIn this case,\n\u00bb\n\u2013\nh\u2206z 2 i\ndN (ze )\ndNe (ze )\n1+\n\u2248\nC(z\n)\n,\n(3)\ne\ndze\ndze\nze2\n\n3\u03b1\n2\n\n\u201e\n\nze\nz\u2217\n\n\u00ab\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b12\n2\n\n\u201e\n\nze\nz\u2217\n\n\u00ab\u03b1\n\n+\n\n\u03b12\n2\n\n\u201e\n\nze\nz\u2217\n\n\u00ab2\u03b1\n\n. (4)\n\nThe term in square brackets shows how the estimated distribution dNe differs from the true one dN . In particular,\nit shows that an accurate estimate of dN can be obtained\nby summing over all objects that have estimated redshift ze ,\nweighting each by the inverse of the term in square brackets\nin the expression above.\nThe general problem is to infer the shape of the intrinsic distribution dN/dz given the measured distribution\ndNe /dze , even if p(ze |z) is not sharply peaked. If p(ze |z) is\nknown, and dNe /dze is measured, then this is an integral\nequation of the first kind, which can be solved to obtain\nthe intrinsic dN/dz. This is possible even if p(ze |z) is fairly\nbroad. Padmanabhan et al. (2004) describe a method to do\nthis, but, for reasons made explicit in Lucy (1974), their\nmethod is not ideal. Before we describe our method, the\nfollowing section shows that estimating the intrinsic luminosity function from photometric redshift data is a similar\ndeconvolution problem.\n\n2.2\n\nTHE VMAX METHOD\n\nI first outline why the problems of estimating dN/dz and\n\u03c6(L) are both best thought of as deconvolution problems. I\nthen show that Lucy's deconvolution algorithm provides an\nefficient way of performing the deconvolution.\n2.1\n\nwhere\n\nThe luminosity distribution: \u03c6(L)\n\nLet \u03c6(M |z) denote the number density of galaxies with ab2\nsolute magnitudes M \u221d \u22122.5 log 10 L, where L = l 4\u03c0DL\n(z)\nis the luminosity, l is the apparent brightness, and DL (z) is\nthe luminosity distance at z. Assume for the moment that\nthere is no evolution (extending the analysis to include evolution is the subject of work in progress). Then \u03c6(M |z) is\nindependent of z.\nSimply adding up the total number of galaxies in a magnitude limited catalog which have luminosity L and dividing\nby the total volume of the survey is not a good estimator\nof \u03c6(L) itself. This is because the more luminous objects\nwill be visible to larger distances. Let Vmax (M ) denote the\nlargest comoving volume out to which an object of absolute magnitude M can be seen. If the catalog is limited at\nboth ends, then there is a minimum volume below which\nthe object would have been too bright to be included in the\ncatalog: call this Vmin (M ). The number of galaxies with absolute magnitude M in a catalog magnitude limited at both\nends is\nh\ni\nN (M ) = \u03c6(M ) Vmax (M ) \u2212 Vmin (M ) .\n\n(5)\n\nTherefore, if we sum over all the galaxies in a magnitude\nlimited catalog, and we weight each object by the inverse of\nVmax (M ) \u2212 Vmin (M ), then we will actually have estimated\nthe luminosity function. This is the basis of the 1/Vmax\nmethod (Schmidt 1968).\nIf the estimate ze of the true redshift z comes with a\nlarge uncertainty, this translates into an uncertainty in the\nluminosity (this assumes that the error in redshift determination does not affect the observed apparent magnitude).\nThe total number of objects with estimated absolute mag-\n\n\fPhoto-z redshift and luminosity distributions\nnitudes Me is\nNe (Me )\n\n=\n=\n\nZ\nZ\n\nmmax\n\ndm\nmmin\n\ndDL\n\nZ\n\ndVcom\ndDL\n\ndDL n(m, DL ) p(m \u2212 Me |DL , m)\nZ\n\nMmax (DL )\n\ndM \u03c6(M )\nMmin (DL )\n\n\u00d7\n=\n\nZ\n\ndM \u03c6(M )\n\nZ\n\np(M \u2212 Me |DL , M )\n\nDL (Mmax )\n\nDL (Mmin )\n\n\u00d7\n\ndDL\n\ndVcom (DL )\ndDL\n\np(M \u2212 Me |DL , M ),\n\nBefore moving on to the solution, note that the assumption that p(M \u2212 Me |DL , M ) does not depend explicitly on\nDL itself, is not crucial. I have mainly made the assumption here so that the form of the argument is clear. If it\ndoes depend on DL , then the weighting factor in the integrand is a more complicated function of M than simply\nN (M ) p(Me |M ).\n2.3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that 5 log10 De = m \u2212\nMe = 5 log10 DL + M \u2212 Me , so p(De |DL , m) dDe = p(M \u2212\nMe |DL , m) dMe . Note that if there is no error in the distance, then p(M \u2212 Me ) is a delta function centered on M ,\nand this expression reduces to equation (5).\nIf V(Vmax , Vmin , M ) denotes result of performing the integral over DL in the final expression above, then\nZ\nNe (Me ) = dM \u03c6(M ) V(Vmax , Vmin , M ).\n(7)\nSince Vmax and Vmin are known functions of M , V itself is\nreally just a complicated function of M . To get some feel for\nits form, suppose that the error in determining the redshift\ndoes not depend on apparent magnitude, and, in addition,\nthe error distribution is a function of the ratio De /DL only.\nThen p(M \u2212 Me |DL , M ) does not depend explicitly on DL\nitself, so it can be taken out of the integral over DL . In this\ncase,\nh\ni\nV = Vmax (M ) \u2212 Vmin (M ) p(Me |M ),\n(8)\nNow, \u03c6(M ) times the term in square brackets is the intrinsic\nN (M ) distribution (equation 5), so equation (7) becomes\nZ\nNe (Me ) = dM N (M ) p(Me |M ).\n(9)\nIn this case, the observed distribution of Me is the convolution, not just of the luminosity function \u03c6 with the error\ndistribution p, but of the product of \u03c6 and (Vmax \u2212 Vmin )\nwith p. The inclusion of this second term accounts for the\nfact that more objects are likely to scatter down from large\nz to small than the other way around, simply because there\nis a greater volume at larger z. The form of the expression\nabove shows clearly that one generically expects distance\nerrors to scatter objects from the peak of the N (M ) distribution to the tails. Unless it is corrected for, this will lead\none to overestimate the number density of low and high luminosity objects relative to the mean.\nWhen the distances are known accurately, one can simply use \u03c6 = N/V as a non-parametric estimate of the luminosity function. However, the expression above shows that\nthe relation between Ne (Me ) and \u03c6 is more complicated\nthan when the distance is not known precisely: determining\n\u03c6 requires solution of an integral equation. In this respect,\nthe problem is similar to that of determining dN/dz when\ndNe /dze and p(ze |z) are known. Once again, in the case of\nsmall errors, one can expand the integrand in a power series\nand then perform the integral to determine the correction\nfactor C(Me ) that is required if one wishes to weight galaxies by 1/[(1 + C)V ] and so estimate \u03c6 from the number of\nobserved Me . But the general case is more complicated.\n\n3\n\nNon-parametric deconvolution and the Vmax\nmethod\n\nSince Ne (Me ), p(Me |M ) and dVcom /dz are all known, the\nrelation to be solved for \u03c6(M ) is an integral equation of the\nfirst kind. Standard arguments show that it can be written\nas a matrix equation which can then be solved for \u03c6(M ).\nThe problem with this approach is how one accounts for the\nfact that the measured Ne (Me ) distribution may be noisy.\nIn particular, since Ne (Me ) is likely to be smoother than\nN (M ), if Ne contains sharp features, then the recovered N\nwill contain sharper features. If sharp features are expected\nto be unrealistic, and the measurement is noisy (this will always be true in the tails), then an exact inversion of the integral equation is clearly undesirable. An iterative algorithm\nwhich avoids this problem was proposed by Lucy (1974); it\nconverges rapidly and is simple to code (\u223c 20 lines of code),\nso it is the method of choice.\nFigure 1 shows how well this method works on mock\ndata. Mock galaxies were distributed in redshift as indicated\nby the filled circles in the right-hand panels of Figure 1.\nEstimated redshifts were assigned as shown in the bottom\nleft panel (the particular choice of p(ze |z) will be discussed\nshortly). Top left panel compares the estimated and true\nredshifts. The histograms in the panels on the right show the\ndistribution of estimated redshifts. Note how different they\nare from the true distribution: although dN/dz has a single\nwell-defined peak, dNe /dze is almost bimodal. Our choice of\np(ze |z) was chosen to produce just this effect: it mimics the\neffect on some photometric redshift estimators as, e.g., the\n4000\u00c5 break passes from one filter to another. The problem\nis to use the estimated histogram and the known shape of\np(ze |z) to infer that the true intrinsic distribution traces the\nlocus defined by the filled circles. The histogram was used\nas the starting guess for the deconvolution algorithm, after\nwhich the algorithm converged rapidly to the filled circles\n(four iterations are shown; they overlap one another closely).\nFigure 2 provides a more detailed comparison of how well\nthe recovered distribution resembles the true one, and how\ndifferent the photo-z distribution, which was used as the\nstarting guess, is from the true distribution.\nFigure 3 shows results for the luminosity function. The\npanel on the left shows the intrinsic N (M ) (solid circles) and\nestimated Ne (M ) (open circles) distributions in a mock catalog generated assuming the same flat cosmological model\nas before, but with the intrinsic distribution of luminosities\nand the apparent magnitude limits chosen to be those of\nthe galaxies in the SDSS survey (Blanton et al. 2003). The\nestimated redshifts were assumed to follow p(De |D)dDe =\n(dx/x)(\u03b3x)\u03b3 exp(\u2212\u03b3x)/\u0393(\u03b3), where x = De /D and \u03b3 = 5.\nThis distribution has hxi = 1, and \u03c3x2 = 1/\u03b3. With \u03b3 = 5,\nthis error distribution is substantially worse than typical\nphotometric redshift errors. Notice how N (Me ) is broader\nthan the true distribution: it has noticably more objects in\n\n\f4\n\nR. K. Sheth\n\nFigure 1. Example of the difference between the intrinsic redshift distribution (filled circles with error bars in panels on right) and\nthe photometric redshift distribution (histograms in panels on right). Panels on the left compare the intrinsic and estimated redshifts.\nJagged lines in panels on right show how successive iterations converge rapidly to the intrinsic distribution: the histogram was used as\nthe starting guess.\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of true intrinsic redshift distribution and\nthat recovered by the algorithm described in the text. Symbols\nwith error bars show one realization of the intrinsic distribution\n(the difference from unity is 'shot-noise' due to the finite size of\nthe sample). Histogram shows the associated photo-z distribution, and jagged curve shows the recovered distribution after four\niterations: the histogram was used as the starting guess.\n\nthe tails, and hence fewer near the peak. This is the generic\neffect we mentioned earlier.\nThe open circles in the panel on the right show the\nresult of converting from Ne (M ) to \u03c6(M ) using Schmidt's\nmethod with no correction for the photometric redshift error\ndistribution. This estimate has more luminous galaxies, and\na steeper faint-end slope, than the true distribution shown\nby the solid circles. For photo-z error distributions which are\napproximately symmetric, this sort of discrepancy is generic.\nThe solid lines in the panel on the left show successive iterations of the deconvolution algorithm, starting from\nthe open circles. Convergence to the correct distribution is\nclearly seen. The solid line in the panel on the left shows\nthe result of applying Schmidt's method to the estimate of\nN (M ) returned by the final iteration shown. It is an excellent approximation to the intrinsic distribution.\n\n\fPhoto-z redshift and luminosity distributions\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. Reconstruction of the intrinsic N (M ) distribution (filled circles) from the distribution of estimated redshifts when distance\nuncertainties are large (open circles). Error bars on the filled circles assume Poisson statistics. Different curves show how successive\niterations of the deconvolution algorithm approximate the intrinsic distribution increasingly well: the open circles were used as the\nstarting guess, and curves show results after iterations 1, 8, 15, and 22. Panel on the left shows the observed distribution, and panel on\nthe right shows the associated estimate of the luminosity function. Dashed curve shows the input luminosity function. The generic effect\nof photo-z errors, which the deconvolution algorithm rectifies (compare solid line with filled circles), is to enhance the large luminosity\ntail, and steepen the faint end slope (compare open with filled circles).\n\nTo illustrate that the generic effect of distance errors\nis to scatter objects from the peak of N (Me ) into the tails,\nthus increasing the expected number of high luminosity objects and increasing the slope at small luminosities, Figure 5\nshows a similar calculation, but now when the true intrinsic\nluminosity function is a Gaussian in absolute magnitude.\nThe precise parameter values were chosen to match those\nof early-type galaxies in the SDSS, and, once again, I have\nassumed photo-z error distributions (Gaussian with 1 mag\nrms) that are significantly broader than most photo-z algorithms return. Notice again how the algorithm rapidly converges from the observed counts (open circles) to the true\nones (filled circles).\n\n3\n\nTHE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD METHOD\n\nIn magnitude limited samples, an unbiased estimate of the\nluminosity function is obtained by maximizing the (log of\n\nthe) likelihood function\nY\npi , where\nL(a) =\ni\n\npi\n\n=\n\n\u03c6(Li |zi , a)\n\u03c6(Li |zi , a)\n=\nR Lmax (zi )\nS(zi , a)\ndL\n\u03c6(L|z\n,\na)\ni\nL\n(z )\nmin\n\n(10)\n\ni\n\n(Sandage, Tammann & Yahil 1979; Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson 1988). Here zi denotes the redshift of galaxy i,\n\u03c6(L|z, a) is the luminosity function at z, with shape specified\nby the parameters a, and Lmin (z) is the minimum luminosity which a galaxy at z must have to be observed in the\nflux limited catalog. That is to say, the parameters a which\nspecify the luminosity function are those for which\nX \u2202 ln pi\n\u2202 lnL\n=\n= 0.\n(11)\n\u2202a\n\u2202a\ni\nNote that our notation allows the model luminosity function\nto have a parametric form, in which case a denotes the free\nparameters of the model, or to be non-parametric, in which\ncase the luminosity function is represented as a sum over\n\n\f6\n\nR. K. Sheth\n\nbins in luminosity, and a denotes the parameters necessary\nto specify the bin shapes-the most popular shapes being\ntophats, or Gaussians, or concave polynomials with compact\nsupport.\nIf the redshift z is not known precisely, and if the inaccuracy in redshift does not affect the observed apparent\nmagnitude, then the method should be modified as follows.\nLet Li and zi denote the true luminosity and redshift of\ngalaxy i, which together determine li , the observed apparent brightness of the object. If \u03b6i denotes the estimated redshift, then this, with li , determines the estimated luminosity\nwhich we will denote \u03bbi .\nThe number of objects in a flux-limited catalog with estimated values \u03b6 and \u03bb depends on the true intrinsic distribution of L and z, and on the distribution of redshift errors.\nSince errors in redshift do not alter the observed apparent\nbrightness, the number distribution of estimated redshifts is\nexpected to be\nZ\nZ\ndVcom lmax\ndl 4\u03c0DL2 (z)\nN (\u03b6, a) =\ndz\ndz\nlmin\n \u0328 \"\n\"\n \u0328\n\u00d7 \u03c6 4\u03c0DL2 (z)l \u0328a p(\u03b6|z, l), (12)\n\nif the intrinsic distribution is parametrized by a. Here\np(\u03b6|z, l) represents the distribution of estimated redshifts\n\u03b6 given true z and l. Similarly, the joint distribution of estimated \u03bb and \u03b6 is\nZ\ndVcom\n\u03bb N (\u03bb, \u03b6, a) =\ndz\n4\u03c0DL2 (z)l\ndz\n \u0328 \"\n\"\n \u0328\n\u00d7 \u03c6 4\u03c0DL2 (z)l \u0328a p(\u03b6|z, l).\n(13)\n\nNotice that if the redshift-error distribution is independent\nof l, then\nZ\nN (\u03b6, a) =\ndz dVcom /dz S(z, a) p(\u03b6|z)\nZ\n\u2261\ndz N (z, a) p(\u03b6|z) :\n(14)\n\nthis is just the convolution of the intrinsic redshift distribution (in a flux-limited catalog) with the redshift-error distribution.\nBy analogy to when the distances are\nQ known accurately,\nthe likelihood to be maximized is L = i pi , where pi is the\nfraction of the number of objects expected to have estimated\nredshifts \u03b6i which also have estimated luminosity \u03bbi :\nL(a) =\n\nY\ni\n\npi ,\n\nwhere\n\npi =\n\nN (\u03bbi , \u03b6i , a)\n.\nN (\u03b6i , a)\n\n(15)\n\nThis expression for pi differs from that in the literature\n(Chen et al. 2003 is missing the factors of dVcom in the integrals which define the numerator and denominator).\nTo check that this expression is indeed the correct one,\nnote that maximizing\nthe (log of the) likelihood requires\nP\nevaluation of i \u2202 lnpi /\u2202a. This reduces to taking the difference of two terms, the first of which is\nZ\nZ\nX \u2202 lnNe (\u03bbi , \u03b6i , a)\nNt (\u03bb, \u03b6) \u2202Ne (\u03bb, \u03b6, a)\n\u2192 d\u03b6\nd\u03bb\n,\n\u2202a\nN\n\u2202a\ne (\u03bb, \u03b6, a)\ni\nwhere we have written the sum over objects as an integral\nover their estimated redshifts and luminosities. Similarly,\n\nthe second term is\nX \u2202 lnNe (\u03b6i , a)\n\u2202a\n\ni\n\n\u2192\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b6\n\nNt (\u03b6) \u2202Ne (\u03b6, a)\n.\nNe (\u03b6, a)\n\u2202a\n\nMaximizing the likelihood means that we vary a until both\nthese expressions are equal.\nSuppose that the true distribution would produce\nNt (\u03bb, \u03b6), and that this true distribution is well described\nby a particular choice of the parameters, say at . Then the\nquestion is, are the two expressions equal when a = at ? If\nnot, our definition of pi is incorrect, because the minimum\nwill occur at some other value of a. To see that it is the\ncorrect choice, note that when Ne (\u03bb, \u03b6, at ) = Nt (\u03bb, \u03b6), then\nthe first expression becomes\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2202Ne (\u03bb, \u03b6, at )\n\u2202Ne (\u03b6, at )\nd\u03b6\nd\u03bb\n= d\u03b6\n.\n\u2202a\n\u2202a\nAnd because\nNe (\u03b6, at ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb Ne (\u03bb, \u03b6, at ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb Nt (\u03bb, \u03b6) = Nt (\u03b6),\n\nR\nthe second expression also reduces to d\u03b6 \u2202Ne (\u03b6, a)/\u2202a.\nThus, both the sums over i reduce to the same quantity.\nHence, maximizing the expression for the likelihood given\nabove (equation 15) does indeed yield an accurate unbiased\nestimate of the luminosity function. This also demonstrates\nthat omission of the dVcom terms present in our expression\nfor pi would lead to a biased estimate of the shape of the\nluminosity function.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS\nGalaxies and QSOs: dN/dz and \u03c6(L)\n\nThe methods above allow one to reconstruct the intrinsic\ndN/dz and \u03c6(L) distributions of, e.g., QSOs, LRGs and\nother galaxy distributions in, e.g., the SDSS. These will be\nuseful for a number of clustering analyses, as well as for\nstudying galaxy evolution. As a proof of concept, Figure 4\nshows the result of running the dN/dz deconvolution algorithm on publically available data. The input QSO catalog\nis from application of the Non-parametric Bayesian Classification algorithm to the SDSS DR1: this produced a catalog of about 100,000 objects (Richards et al. 2004). For\neach object, photometric redshifts were determined following Weinstein et al. (2004). About 22,000 of these objects\nhave spectra from which a spectroscopic redshift estimate\nis available. For this subset of objects, the top left panel\ncompares zphot and zspec . The other panels show that the\ndistribution of p(zphot \u2212 zspec |zspec ) is rather complex. The\npanels on the right show the differences between the true(filled circles) and photo-z distributions (histograms), and\nthat the deconvolution algorithm (curve) does a reasonable\njob reconstructing the former from the latter.\n\n4.2\n\nPeculiar velocities\n\nIn peculiar velocity surveys such as SFI, ENEAR, EFAR\nand 6dF, the distance indicator (the Tully-Fisher, Dn \u2212\u03c3, or\nFundamental Plane relations) is noisy: typically this noise\nis approximately twenty percent of the distance, or about\n\n\fPhoto-z redshift and luminosity distributions\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Left: Distribution of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in the SDSS DR1 NBC QSO catalog. Right: Reconstruction\nof the intrinsic dN/dz distribution (filled circles) from that of the photometric redshifts (histogram) using the deconvolution algorithm\ndescribed previously (curve). The reconstruction is quite accurate, despite the complicated nature of the distance errors.\n\n0.4 mags. If uncorrected for, a generic effect of distance uncertainties is to inflate the estimated number of low (and\nhigh) luminosity galaxies. This is illustrated in Figure 5,\nwhere the error has been set to 1 mag so that the effect is\nmore clearly seen. Since the faint end of the luminosity function provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models, it is important that it be measured accurately. Therefore,\nit may be interesting to apply our methods to data from peculiar velocity surveys. In particular, such methods may be\nnecessary for estimating unbiased luminosity functions from\nHIPASS and ALFALFA.\n\n4.3\nFigure 5. Same as Figure 3, but now the underlying luminosity function is Lognormal (Gaussian in absolute magnitude), and\nthe errors in distance are also assumed to be Lognormal. Parameters were chosen to mimic early-type galaxies in the SDSS\n(from Bernardi et al. 2003), and distance errors were chosen to\nbe about a factor of two larger than in typical peculiar velocity\nsurveys. Notice how the raw photo-z estimate of N (M ) (open circles in panel on left) is broader than the true distribution (filled\ncircles), making the estimated luminosity function have a slight\nexcess of luminous galaxies, and a significantly larger excess of\nfaint galaxies (open circles in panel on right). Nevertheless, when\nstarted from the estimated distribution, our deconvolution algorithm quickly converges to the true distribution.\n\nThe stellar luminosity function\n\nDistances to stars are sometimes estimated by the method of\nphotometric parallax: essentially, this method uses the offset\nfrom a color magnitude-relation to infer a distance. Because\nthe color-magnitude relation almost certainly has intrinsic\nscatter (current estimates are about 0.5 mags), the associated distance estimate is noisy: this is entirely analogous to\nthe noise in distance estimates from peculiar velocity surveys. Determination of the stellar luminosity function is an\nimportant ingredient in understanding the IMF. Most current determinations are based on the method of Stobie et al.\n(1989) which assumes small errors in the distance estimate,\nand requires prior knowledge of the shape of the luminosity function. Since our non-parametric methods are accurate\n\n\f8\n\nR. K. Sheth\n\nFigure 6. Effect of distance errors on the estimated correlation between size and luminosity for early-type galaxies. Steeper\ndashed line shows the true h\u03c3|Li relation, and shallower line shows\na least squares fit to the dots which were obtained by using the\nphoto-z estimate of the distance to compute the sizes and absolute magnitudes.\n\neven when the noise on the distance estimate is large, it may\nbe interesting to apply our methods to this problem as well.\n\n4.4\n\nCorrelations between observables\n\nSo far, I have mainly discussed how to make accurate estimates of the true redshift and luminosity distributions when\nonly noisy distance estimates are available. However, noisy\ndistance estimates have another important effect for which it\nis possible to correct. Namely, galaxy observables are known\nto correlate with one-another: the most well-known of these\nis the correlation between luminosity L and circular velocity\nVc (the Tully-Fisher relation for spirals), or velocity dispersion \u03c3 (the Faber-Jackson relation for ellipticals), but physical size R and surface brightness I are also well-correlated\n(the Kormendy relation for ellipticals), and L also correlates\nwith size and color for both spirals and ellipticals. Every\none of these correlations has been used to constrain galaxy\nformation models, and, since one measures apparent magnitudes and angular sizes rather than absolute magnitudes\nand physical sizes, every one of these relations includes at\nleast one distance-dependent quantity.\nNoise in the distance estimate will lead to biased estimates of these correlations. To illustrate, Figure 6 shows the\ncorrelation between luminosity and size in a catalog which\nis constructed to mimic the SDSS early-type galaxy sample\n(Bernardi et al. 2003). The steeper dashed curve shows the\ntrue hR|Li relation. The dots show the result of assuming\nthat zphot = zspec + gaussian with rms 0.03 (this amount of\nscatter in the distance estimate is realistic), and then recomputing the absolute magnitude and size using zphot instead\n\nof zspec . The shallower dashed line shows hRphot |Lphot i: the\nchange in slope is dramatic.\nThe qualitative nature of the effect is easy to understand. Distance errors scatter objects towards the bright and\nfaint luminosity tails. This increases the spread along the absolute magnitude axis. If this were the only effect, then one\nmight expect the R \u2212 L relation to be shallower. However,\nthe distance error causes a correlated change to the size: assuming an object is closer than it really is makes one infer\na smaller luminosity and size than it really has. So the net\nmotion of each point is left-and-down, or right-and-up. If\nthese motions were parallel to the principal axis of the true\nrelation, the net effect would only be to change the scatter\nof the relation. In this case, they are not, so small distance\nerrors have a non-negligible effect.\nThis bias is simpler to correct-for when only one of the\nvariables is distance-dependent. For instance, in the case of\nthe L-color relation, it is only L which is affected by the\ndistance error (this is not quite true, because k-corrections\ndepend on wavelength-I am mainly using this to illustrate\nan argument). This suggests that if the distance indicator is\nunbiased in the mean, then the mean L as a function color\ncan be estimated directly. (The scatter around this mean\nrelation is interesting in its own right: it will, of course,\nbe affected by the noise in the distance estimate.) In practice, however, even this case is not entirely straightforward,\nbecause galaxy catalogs are almost always magnitude limited, and this introduces selection effects into the estimate\nof hL|colori; absent distance errors, it is hcolor|Li rather\nthan hL|colori which can be estimated free of selection effects! When accurate distances are known, these selection\neffects can be accounted for by using the quantity Vmax\nwhich played an important role in our discussion of the luminosity function. This suggests that the methods discussed\npreviously should allow one to estimate such correlations in\nphotometric galaxy catalogs. When the distance error appears in both variables, it is slightly harder to correct, but\na correction is still possible. Essentially, one simply needs to\nwrite the expressions given previously in matrix rather than\nscalar notation. Making this generalization correctly is the\nsubject of work in progress.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI presented two algorithms for estimating the intrinsic redshift and luminosity distributions from photo-z surveys.\nThese algorithms improve on previous work by Subbarao\net al. (1996) and Chen et al. (2003). Subbarao et al. concluded that numerical simulations were necessary to derive\naccurate estimates-my analysis shows that simulations can\nbe avoided. Chen et al. wrote down a maximum likelihood\nexpression which they then maximized-I find a different\nexpression for the likelihood, and provide an analytic calculation which shows that maximizing this expression does\nindeed lead to an unbiased estimate; maximizing their expression instead would return a biased answer.\nThe error in the photometric redshift gives rise to an\nerror in the estimated luminosity. Since measurement errors in the apparent magnitude also give rise to errors in\nthe estimated luminosity, it is tempting to treat the photoz errors similarly to how one treats the effects of errors in\n\n\fPhoto-z redshift and luminosity distributions\nthe photometry. However, the two errors are not equivalent\nfor the simple but important reason that the photo-z error,\nwhile affecting the estimated luminosity, leaves the observed\napparent magnitude unchanged. In this respect, it is more\naccurate to view the photo-z error as equivalent to a peculiar velocity. This motivates reanalysis of relatively shallow\ngalaxy surveys for which the peculiar velocity may be a substantial fraction of the observed redshift, e.g. faint, nearby,\nlow surface brightness galaxies, or galaxies in the 6dF survey\n(Jones et al. 2004). In this case, the error in the true distance comes from the thickness of the Fundamental Plane,\nor the Dn \u2212\u03c3 relation, and is typically on the order of twenty\npercent.\nThe fractional error on the distances to most stars in our\ngalaxy (those for which parallax measurements are not available) is relatively large. Stobie, Ishada & Peacock (1989)\ndiscuss a method for estimating the luminosity function in\nthe case of photometric parallaxes derived from the colormagnitude relation, but the approach is parametric (it requires an accurate guess of the intrinsic shape of the luminosity function), and it assumes that the distance errors\nare small. Our approach provides accurate non-parametric\nestimates which are valid even when the errors are large.\nWe intend to apply our methods to provide non-parametric\nestimates of the stellar luminosity function which are not\ncompromised by the noise in the distance estimator.\nBoth the maximum likelihood and the Vmax estimators\nI derived assume that galaxies do not evolve, so one must\nbreak the sample up into narrow redshift bins before analysis. This is risky in principle, because one wants a narrow\nbin in true redshift, but only photo-zs are available. In practice, photo-zs are sufficiently accurate that a narrow bin\nin photo-z is still quite narrow in true-z. The maximumlikelihood and Vmax estimators of the luminosity function\nhave another drawback: they ignore the fact that different\ngalaxy types require different k(z)-corrections, so one must\npreselect the sample to insure that it contains galaxies that\nare of the same type. Extending the analysis to allow for\nevolution and type is clearly desirable, and is the subject of\nwork in progress.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was completed while I was at the University of\nPittsburgh where L.
