Therefore, the study of these systems is\nvery important for the microscopic understanding of transport in nanoscaled\nelectronic devices.\n\u2217 Corresponding author\nEmail address: zahn@physik.uni-halle.de (Peter Zahn).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n9 May 2019\n\n\fClassical size effects in the conductivity as explained by the Fuchs-Sondheimer\ntheory occur if the slab thickness d is comparable to the bulk mean free path\n[1,2]. In the limit of small d compared to the mean free path this model predicts\na linear thickness dependence of the slab conductivity. The application of the\nmodel to this case is quite questionable, since a three-dimensional electron\nmotion is assumed. Nevertheless, this behaviour is confirmed by ultrathin film\nexperiments.\nWhen the thickness d approaches the Fermi wavelength \u03bbF quantum size effects (QSE) occur which cause oscillations in typical features of the electronic\nstructure, e.g. density of states at the Fermi level, as a function of slab thickness. Regarding the transport properties Trivedi and Ashcroft predicted a\nsaw-tooth like oscillation of the in-plane conductivity with thickness [3]. In\ntheir free-electron model the oscillation period is equal to half \u03bbF . In reality, the situation is more complicated because of the discrete increase of the\nfilm thickness as well as the change in the electronic structure during growth.\nThere are several interesting experiments which demonstrate QSE. For example, the observation of QSE in the dependence of the Hall coefficient and the\nspecific conductivity on the thickness of ultrathin Pb(111) films [4], the step\nheight oscillations during layer-by-layer growth of Pb on Ge(001) [5], and the\nmanifestation of quantum-well states in angle-resolved photoemission from Ag\nfilms [6] are worthy of mention.\nRecently, the conductivity of ultrathin Pb(111) films consisting of N = 1 . . .8\nmonolayers (ML) was studied by means of ab initio calculations using the fullpotential linearized augmented plane-wave method [7]. The results obtained\nare in a good agreement with the experiment [8], and showed a correlation\nbetween QSE oscillation in the conductivity and in the density of states at\nthe Fermi level.\nIn an earlier paper, we have investigated the evolution of the Co/Cu multilayer\nconductivity during growth using the Boltzmann equation in relaxation-time\napproximation [9]. The transport properties of Cu(001) films of 2 to 5 freestanding ML have already been studied. Now this technique is extended to Cu\nslabs in the thickness range between 1 and 32 ML. We propose a model for\nthe relaxation time of electrons caused by elastic impurity scattering in slabs\nwhich allows us to describe the conductivity in the limit of both very thin and\nvery thick films.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nThe electronic structure of the considered systems is calculated self-consistently\nusing a screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) method [10,11,12,13,14].\n2\n\n\fFor our calculations a screening potential with a barrier height of 4 Ry is\nused and the screened structure constants include coupling to the next four\nnearest neighbours. Spherical potentials in the atomic sphere approximation\n(ASA) are used. The calculations employ the exchange-correlation potential\nin the LDA of Vosko, Wilk, and Nusair [15]. An angular momentum cut-off\nat lmax = 3 is used for the Green's function, thus implying a cut-off for the\ncharge-density components at 2lmax = 6. Due to the slab geometry the states\nat the Fermi level are described by lines in the two-dimensional (2D) Brillouin\nzone (BZ). The Fermi surface integrals have to be replaced by line integrals\n[9]. In the considered geometry the irreducible part equals one eighth of the\n2D BZ and contains in our calculations about 28000 k|| -points to reach convergence. For comparison, the Fermi surface integration for the bulk Cu system\nis performed on about 350000 k-points in the irreducible part of the fcc BZ.\nWe neglect the lattice relaxations at the surfaces. The fcc lattice constant is\ntaken equal to A=6.76 a.u. [16].\nThe transport is treated quasiclassically by solving the linearized Boltzmann\nequation which in the anisotropic relaxation-time approximation gives the\nfollowing expression for the components of the conductivity tensor \u03c3\u0302 of a\ncrystal [17,18]\n2e2 X\n\u03c3ij =\n\u03b4(Ek \u2212 EF )vki vkj \u03c4k ,\n(1)\nV k\nwhere e is the electron charge, V is the system volume, EF the Fermi energy,\nvki the component of the group velocity with a Cartesian coordinate i of an\nelectron in the band n with crystal momentum vector k and relaxation time\n\u03c4k at the energy Ek (k is a shorthand notation for k and n). The factor 2 is\ndue to the spin degeneracy. For a cubic crystal and a 2D lattice with square\nsymmetry the transport properties are isotropic \u03c3ij = \u03c3\u03b4ij .\nIn the case of film geometry the relaxation time \u03c4f ilm has to be determined by\nthe scattering at impurities inside of the slab as well as on surface imperfections\n1\n\u03c4f ilm\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n+\n.\n\u03c4b \u03c4s\n\n(2)\n\nSince our calculations are performed at T = 0K, the inelastic scattering by\nphonons is neglected. First, we consider the scattering rate (\u03c4 b )\u22121 caused by\nbulk-like defects inside the slab. The microscopic transition probability for an\nelectron to be scattered from a state k into a state k \u2032 , is given by Fermi's\nGolden Rule [10,18]\nPkk\u2032 =\n\n2\u03c0\n|Tkk\u2032 |2 \u03b4(Ek \u2212 Ek\u2032 ) ,\n~\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the transition matrix Tkk\u2032 is defined by\nTkk\u2032 =< \u03a8\u030ak |\u2206V |\u03a8k\u2032 > .\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fHere \u2206V denotes the perturbation of the potential, \u03a8\u030ak and \u03a8k\u2032 are the unperturbed and perturbed Bloch states of the system, respectively. Within the\nassumption of \u03b4-scatterers [10] with the scattering strength tb at all impurity\nsites ri in the slab\n\u2206V (r) =\n\nMb\nX\n\ntb \u03b4(r \u2212 ri ) ,\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nthe relaxation time \u03c4kb is given by the expression [10]\nMb\nX\n1\n2\u03c0 2 X\n\u2032 =\nP\n|\u03a8\u030ak (ri )|2 n(ri , EF ) .\n=\nt\nkk\nb\n\u03c4kb\n~\n\u2032\ni=1\nk\n\n(6)\n\nThe number Mb denotes the number of bulk-like defects in the slab. Equation\n(6) includes the probability amplitude of a state k at the impurity position\n|\u03a8\u030ak (ri )|2 and the local density of states at Fermi level n(ri , EF ). Further simplifications can be achieved by averaging the scattering rate (6) over all states\nk at the Fermi energy EF and over the configurations of the impurity sites\nri . We assume the same probability amplitude of perturbed Bloch state at\nall impurity sites in the film. Introducing the bulk density \u033ab = Mb /Sd of\nscattering centres, with S the area of the film and d the slab thickness, the\naveraged relaxation time is given by\n1\n2\u03c0nf ilm (EF )t2b \u033ab\n=\n,\n\u03c4b\n~S0 d\n\n(7)\n\nwhere nf ilm (EF ) is the total film density of states at the Fermi level (per slab\nunit cell). The area of the film unit cell is given by the film area divided by\nthe number of unit cells in the slab S0 = S/Ncell .\nNow, to describe the second term in Eq.(2) we introduce the additional number\nMs of the surface imperfections on the slab surfaces with the surface density\n\u033as = Ms /S. Similar to the above derivation, an expression for \u03c4 s is obtained\n2\u03c0nsurf (EF )t2s \u033as\n1\n=\n.\n\u03c4s\n~S0 Ds d\n\n(8)\n\nHere nsurf (EF ) is the local density of states in the surface region at the Fermi\nlevel (per slab unit cell), ts is the parameter for the scattering strength of the\nsurface imperfections. Ds is the thickness of the surface region which contains\nthe surface defects.\nIntroducing the defects of scattering strength tb in a bulk material, the bulk\nscattering rate is obtained similar\n1\n\u03c4bulk\n\n=\n\n2\u03c0nbulk (EF )t2b \u033ab\n,\n~S0 D\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere nbulk (EF ) is the density of states at the Fermi level per bulk unit cell.\nThe volume of the bulk unit cell is expressed by S0 D with the interlayer\ndistance D = d/N, where N denotes the number of monolayers in the slab.\nNow, introducing the dimensionless function\n\u03b3(N) =\n\n\u03c4b N\nt2 \u033as nsurf (EF )N\n= 2s\n,\n\u03c4s\ntb \u033ab nf ilm (EF )Ds\n\n(10)\n\nand using equations (7), (8), and (9), the relaxation time in the slab is obtained\nby\nNnbulk (EF )\n\u03c4bulk\n\u03c4f ilm =\n*\n.\n(11)\nnf ilm (EF ) (1 + \u03b3(N)/N)\nThe function \u03b3(N) has a clear physical meaning. It defines the ratio between\nthe strength of the electron scattering at surface imperfections and at impurities inside of the slab. By virtue of the proportionality of nf ilm (EF ) to N the\nfunction \u03b3(N) is approximated in this work by a constant value \u03b3, even for the\ncase of small thicknesses. Moderate changes in \u03b3(N) for small thicknesses may\nchange the results quantitatively, but the general trend remains unchanged. In\nthe limit of large N \u226b \u03b3 the relaxation time in the film \u03c4f ilm reaches the bulk\nvalue \u03c4bulk . In the limit of very thin films the expression (11) is equivalent to\nthe one used in the ref.[7] and that derived from a free-electron model assuming elastic and diffuse surface scattering [19,20]. The authors of [7] considered\nultrathin Pb(111) films (N = 1 . . .8 ML) with only one adjustable parameter\nlike t2s \u033as in Eq.(8), and they obtained a linear dependence of the conductivity\non the slab thickness which is in a good agreement with the experiment [8] for\nthe considered thickness range. In addition, we have introduced t2b \u033ab to treat\nthicker slabs. Their conductivity is appreciably determined by the properties\nof the bulk region of the slab and does not exhibit the linear thickness dependence (see, e.g. [4]). Normalizing the film conductivity \u03c3f ilm to the bulk\nconductivity \u03c3bulk it is possible to keep one adjustable parameter \u03b3(N) only.\nFinally, performing the integration in Eq.(1) over the Fermi surface (for the\nslab - the Fermi lines) [21], we obtain in case of cubic symmetry\n\u03c3f ilm\n3\u03c0nbulk (EF ) n dln |vn (EF )|\n=\n,\nP R\n\u03c3bulk\nnf ilm (EF )D(1 + \u03b3(N)/N) n dSn |vn (EF )|\nP R\n\n(12)\n\nwhere dln and dSn are differential Fermi line and Fermi surface elements,\nrespectively.\nIn case of constant relaxation times \u03c4f ilm \u2261 \u03c4bulk for all slab thicknesses (like\nin ref.[9]) the ratio of the conductivities \u03c3f ilm /\u03c3bulk can be transformed to the\n5\n\n\f2\n2\nratio \u03c9P,f\nilm /\u03c9P,bulk\n\n\u03c9P,f ilm\n=\n\u03c9P,bulk\n\n3\u03c0 n dln |vn (EF )|\nP R\nND n dSn |vn (EF )|\nP R\n\n!1/2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c9P,f ilm and \u03c9P,bulk are the slab and the bulk Drude-type plasma frequencies [22], respectively. This ratio can be extracted from infrared transmission\nexperiments [23].\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nIn Fig.1 we show the total slab density of states at the Fermi level nf ilm (EF )\ndetermined from the one-particle energy spectrum En (k). In addition to the\npeak for films of 2 and 3 ML in thickness large densities at the Fermi level are\nobtained for the thicknesses of 9, 17, and 30 ML. In the asymptotic case of\nvery large N the oscillations in n(EF ) are governed by Fermi surface nesting\nvectors along the (001) direction, which are known to dominate the oscillations of interlayer exchange coupling [24]. In the investigated thickness range\nthe oscillations with a period of 2.6 ML could be identified by Fourier analysis. This oscillation corresponds to the short-period oscillation of interlayer\nexchange coupling [24].\nThe evolution of electrical conductivity with film thickness, Eq.(12), is presented in Fig.2 with different values of the parameter \u03b3 for the strength of\nthe surface scattering. In principle, it is possible to get the value of \u03b3 (or the\nfunctional dependence \u03b3(N)) from a comparison with experimental data. Unfortunately, experimental data concerning the conductivity during growth of\nvery thin Cu slabs are missing. The reason is the prefered initial growth mode\nof Cu on insulating substrates, which forms islands instead of a continous\nfilm [25]. Reasonable values of \u03b3 can roughly be estimated from a comparison\nwith the experimental data for the conductivity of Fe [22] and Pb [4] films.\nThe ratio \u03c3f ilm /\u03c3bulk is about 0.6 for an Fe(001) slab with 31 ML (\u2248 4.5 nm)\nthickness, and \u03c3f ilm /\u03c3bulk is about 0.3 for a Pb(111) film with 18 ML (\u2248 5.1\nnm) thickness, assuming a bulk Pb conductivity of 0.213 (\u03bc\u03a9cm)\u22121 [26]. Of\ncourse, these data show the strong dependence on the material. Nevertheless,\nthe range of \u03b3 should be between 10 and 100 to describe the existing experimental situations. In this range, strong QSE's can be recognized from Fig.2,\nwhich are clearly correlated to the behaviour of n(EF ) in Fig.1.\nFigure 3 shows the results for the ratio of plasma frequencies \u03c9P,f ilm /\u03c9P,bulk .\nFrom this picture a 1/N behaviour for large N is evident. In the framework of a\nmodel of free electrons in a box with the height d = ND and Fermi wave vector\nkF the asymptotic behaviour for large N is obtained as (\u03c9P,f ilm /\u03c9P,bulk )2 \u2248\n6\n\n\f1 \u2212 3\u03c0/4kF d \u2212 \u03c0 2 /4kF2 d2 . The same expression was found for the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the charge density in ref.[3], since \u03c9P2 is proportional to the charge\ndensity in the free-electron model.\nThe strong increase of \u03c9P,f ilm for small N is related to the increase of the\nFermi velocity caused by the large contribution of fast surface states. This is\ndemonstarted in Fig.4 presenting the Fermi velocity vF = h|vk (EF )|ik averaged over all states k. The ratio of vF for a 32 ML Cu(001) slab to the averaged\nFermi velocity of Cu bulk is about 0.766. It is obvious, that this ratio does\nnot reach one even for large N, since the Fermi velocity in the slab geometry\ncorresponds to the projection of the bulk Fermi velocity into a plane perpendicular to the slab growth direction. The free-electron model gives a ratio of\n\u03c0/4 \u2248 0.785. The strong similarities of our results calculated for Cu slabs\nwith those found from a free-electron model are direct consequences of the\nfree-electron character of the Cu Fermi surface [18].\nThe qualitative behaviour of the \u03c9P,f ilm /\u03c9P,bulk is very close to data obtained\nfrom infrared transmission spectroscopy performed during the evaporation of\nFe on MgO(001) in ultrahigh vacuum (see fig.5 in ref.[23]). Although we have\nto note, that in the experiment the strong increase of \u03c9P,f ilm for very thin slabs\ncan be due to a strong influence from the morphology and the large roughness\nof the films just above the percolation threshold. We should mention also, that\n\u03c9P,f ilm does not saturate to a constant value after 4-5 ML as we reported in\nan earlier paper [9]. This conclusion was drawn based on the results of Cu\nslabs with thickness of from 2 to 5 free-standing monolayers.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe present a model for the description of the transport properties of thin\nmetallic films based on the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation with\na quite simple and at the same time reasonable assumption for the relaxation\ntime. This approximation for the relaxation time derived from the microscopic\ntreatment of the scattering processes has only one adjustable parameter, and\nis valid in the limits of very thin as well as very thick films. The qualitative\nbehaviour of the slab conductivity found in this approach is close to the experimental data for thin metallic films. For very thin films we see a linear\ndependence of the conductivity on the thickness which was expected from the\nFuchs-Sondheimer theory. In addition, the influence of QSE's is superimposed\nand causes the dips on the otherwise monotonic curve. The calculated Drudetype plasma frequency shows the dominance of the surface electronic structure\nfor thicknesses smaller than 5 ML . So, both classical and quantum size effects,\nas well as surface states manifest in our results.\n7\n\n\fThe method applied in this paper can be used for metallic films with arbitrary\nthickness limited by the computer power only.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, and\nby INTAS (Grant No. 2001-0386).
