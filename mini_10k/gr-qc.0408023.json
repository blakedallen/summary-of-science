Introduction\nIn recent years there has been a renewed interest in reports about anomalies during\nsolar eclipses. Realizing that our understanding of gravity at galactic scales may be\ninsufficient (giving rise to theories like MOND [Mil83, SanM02]), the observation of an\nanomalous acceleration on spacecrafts in the solar system (the Pioneer Anomaly\n[AndL02]), anomalous velocity increases of spacecrafts during Earth flybys [AntG98,\nAndW00, NieT04] and even discussions about whether we understand gravity at\nlaboratory scale [MbeL02, Mel99, GerG02] may have contributed to this renewed\ninterest. Also the (unfinished) project by NASA [NASA99] in 1999 played a role as well\nas several publications which hypothesized conventional causes for the eclipse\nphenomena [UnnM01, FlaY03, RuyS03, YanW02].\nSince the 1950's there have been several reports on anomalous behaviour of various\nkinds of mechanical oscillators during solar eclipses. Replications of these experiments\nby others did not always confirm the existence of these effects. Concerning these\nreplications, it can be remarked, however, that most of these were modified versions of\nthe original experimental setups and that the conditions of various solar eclipses\n(elevation of the Sun during the eclipse, geographical latitude, speed of the shadow, etc.)\ndiffer remarkably from one to another. Little attention has been paid to these differences\nbecause often only simple classical mechanical mechanisms (e.g., Majorana shielding of\ngravity [Eck90, Edw02, Fla96, SliC65]) were considered.\nThe first publications, by Allais, were about measurements with so-called paraconical\npendula [All57, All59, All97]. These reports are still considered to be among the most\nreliable, not in the least because the results of measurements during two solar eclipses\n\n1/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\nwere qualitatively and quantitatively similar (see Figs. 1 and 2). Later, also reports about\nobservations with torsion pendula [SaxA71] and with Foucault pendula [MihM03] were\nadded to this. Several replications of these experiments yielded negative results [Kuu91,\nKuu92, JunJ91]. A re-analysis of the observations of Saxl and Allen during the 1970\nsolar eclipse in the USA is depicted in Fig. 3.\n\nLocal Time [h]\nFig. 1. Measurements during the June 30, 1954 solar eclipse with a paraconical pendulum by\nAllais [All59a, All97]. Vertical axis is the azimuth angle of the pendulum trajectory (in grades,\n100 grades=90o). Also a linear trend line is shown. Each point is the accumulated effect of 14\nmin of measurement, pendulum release is every 20 min.\n\nFig. 2. Measurements during the 2 October 1959 solar eclipse with a paraconical pendulum by\nAllais [All97]. Vertical axis is the azimuth angle of the pendulum trajectory (grades).\n\nLatham noticed that the anomalous deviations during the eclipse of the paraconical\npendulum of Allais had the same time behaviour as that of the torsion pendulum of Saxl\nand Allen (change in azimuth angle and change in oscillation period, respectively)\n[Lat80]. The quantity measured by Allais is actually an integral value, the action\nbuilding up during the 14 min of measurements. When one fits the Allais data with a\nsmooth curve and takes its derivative, a time behaviour like depicted in Fig. 4 becomes\nvisible. These time-patterns may be important in finding the cause(s) of the effects.\nRecently, some positive reports about observations with gravimeters during solar\neclipses by a Chinese team [WanY00, YanW02, TanW03] attracted attention.\n2/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\nDecreases in the gravitational acceleration up to ~7 mgal, just before 1st contact and\n\u22128\n\u22122\naround the 4th contact were measured (1 mgal = 10 ms ). These measurements were\nperformed after a positive result by Mishra and Rao during an eclipse in 1995 in India\n[MisR97], see Fig. 5. Measurements with gravimeters by others, however, were all\nnegative [DucS99, Meu00, Man01, Tom55]. These earlier negative results with\ngravimeters led to speculations that the effects were only observable with dynamical\nmeasurement devices like torsion pendula [SaxA71].\n\nFig. 3. A re-analysis of the Saxl and Allen data [Dui05]. All separate data points are used, Saxl\nand Allen combined 5 data points into one and used their standard deviation as value for the error\nbar. This has little influence on the fitted curve. EST (Eastern Standard Time) = UT \u2013 5 h, also\nsee [USNO]. First contact at 12:31 h, maximum 13:40 h, last contact 14:58 h. The totality at the\nobservation point was ~96.5%.\n\nFig. 4.

Maximum solar coverage between approx. 6:30 h and 7:00 h,\naccording to the authors.\n\n2. Conventional explanations of the observations\nExplanations for the anomalous instrument readings during eclipses, based on\nconventional physics, can be subdevided into 6 kinds, which will be treated\nsubsequently:\n1. Seismic disturbances due to increased human activity before and just after an\neclipse [UnnM01].\n2. Gravitational effects of an increased density air mass spot due to cooling of the\nupper atmosphere [FlaY03].\n3. Tilt due to temperature change of the soil and other atmospheric influences\n[YanW02, FlaY03].\n4. Tilt due to atmospheric loading.\n5. Influence of eclipse induced changes of the geomagnetic field.\n6. Instrumental errors [RuyS03].\n2.1. Increased seismic activity\nUnnikrishnan et al. [UnnM01] developed a model based on the speculation that the\ngravity anomaly as observed by Wang et al. [WanY00] might be due to seismic\ndisturbance caused by human activity. Preceding the first contact and after the last phase\nof the eclipse there will be increased traffic when people move into or out of the eclipse\nzone which causes the increase of seismic noise. In recent years, this hypothesis has\nbeen accepted a few times as a conventional explanation for the observations [e.g.,\nBerT02]. It is, however, highly unlikely to have been taken place during the\nmeasurements by Wang et al. Their measurements were performed in a geophysical\nobservation station in a remote area in the North of China where the nearest road is\nseveral kilometers away and the experimenters were situated at 200 m distance [Yan04].\nA survey of seismic data taken in Southern Belgium during the 1999 eclipse showed\nno sign at all of such an increased disturbance [Cam04]. Surely, if it was happening, it\nshould be visible in such a densely populated area. Nevertheless, it is highly advisable\nthat future measurements will be accompanied by the simultaneous measurement of\nseismic activity.\n\n4/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\n2.2. Gravitational effects of an increased density spot in the upper atmosphere due to\ncooling\nVan Flandern and Yang modeled a traveling atmospheric excess mass spot due to\ncooling during the eclipse of higher atmospheric layers (above cloud level) [FlaY03].\nCalculations show indeed that, when the density of the cooled spot of the upper\natmosphere increases by 0.1% over the whole area of the shadow spot, a moving excess\n10\n11\nmass of the order of 10 \u2013 10 kg is conceivable with its barycentre at an altitude of\nabout 10 km. Taking the maximum value, this would yield a maximal vertical\nacceleration of\nav =\n\nGm air\n\u2248 7 \u030110\u20138 ms\u20132,\n2\n(10km )\n\nindeed of the right magnitude. This model, however, presumes that air streams from\nthe surrounding with speeds of the order of several 100 m/s. More realistic air speeds\nwould imply that the \"mass concentration\" lags behind the shadow by at least 15 min\n(during which it will be already heated again, in thus way reducing the effect). The\nmagnitude of this effect may therfore also be determined by the velocity of the shadow\nrelative to the Earth surface. The magnitude of this varies from 0.5\u20131.0 km/s, depending\non the eclipse.\nThe amount of barometric pressure increase at sea level of 0.6% which Van Flandern\nand Yang cite [Geo99] is a rather extreme value, which is confirmed nowhere. Van\nRuymbeke et al. [RuyS03] report changes of the order of 0.5 hPa (~0.05%) in Vienna.\nFarges et al. [FarP03] report pressure changes due to the gravity waves1 generated by the\n5\neclipse of the order of 10 Pa at sea level (=10\u2013 effect). The observed pressure change at\nsea level should, actually, not be too important in the scenario described by Van\nFlandern and Yang. What is happening in this scenario is that the relation used for\ncorrection for atmospheric pressure change (the so-called admittance factor, e.g., \u20130.3\nmgal mbar-1 [DucS99, CroH02]) breaks down.2\nA problem is that little information is available about the behaviour of the\natmosphere during eclipses at the altitudes used in these calculations. Virtually all\npublications about atmospheric effects either concern those near ground level or at high\naltitudes (ionosphere). Balloon measurements of pressure and temperature during solar\neclipses at altitudes of the order of 10 km would therefore be very useful.\nAlso, in this model of Van Flandern and Yang, one would expect deviations of\nopposite sign around the observed deviations since there would necessarily be a\ndepletion zone around the increased density spot. This is not visible in the data\n([WanY00], Fig. 1) to a level \u2264 10% of the observed decreases in g.\nThough this model still seems to be a reasonable candidate to explain the anomalous\ngravimeter behaviour, it certainly cannot account for the effects observed with torsion,\nparaconical and Foucault pendula, despite the title of the publication by Van Flandern\nand Yang. These devices have little sensitivity for changes in the vertical component of\n1\n\nA wave disturbance in the atmosphere in which buoyancy (or reduced gravity) acts as the\nrestoring force on fluid parcels displaced from hydrostatic equilibrium. Not to confuse with\ngravitational waves as predicted by General Relativity.\n2\nGravimeter signals are often corrected for changes in atmospheric pressure [CroH02]. For the\nChinese data no correction was applied. A change in pressure of approx. 1.3 hPa was observed\nfor which the authors conclude that no correction was nescessary (effect << 1 mgal).\n5/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\ngravity. For changes of the magnitude of tidal forces (of the order of 100 mgal [Net76,\nDucS99]), Saxl and Allen determined the influence on the oscillation period of their\n5\ntorsion pendulum to be a factor of 10 to small to account for their observations\n[SaxA71].\n2.3. Tilt due to temperature change of the soil and other atmospheric influences\nCooling of the Earth crust due to the eclipse shadow has been mentioned a few times\nas being responsible for eclipse effects, e.g., by Yang and Wang, who also studied it\nexperimentally [YanW02]. They found a ground tilt < 10 mrad for a temperature drop of\n2 K, whereas a tilt of the order of 100 mrad would explain the decrease in g of Wang et\nal. [WanY00] quantitatively.\nOn the qualitative side, it must be remarked that measurements of soil temperatures\nshow that the drop in temperature due to an eclipse is only noticeable up to a dept of a\nfew cm and that it lags the shadow by about 30 min [L-HY00, EatH97, FokW01] on\nsunny days. Furthermore, the magnitude of tilt is mainly determined by the gradient in\ntemperature, which is usually not larger during an eclipse than during heating in the\nmorning or cooling at the end of a day.\nThe measurements by Allais were performed in a basement, those by Saxl and Allen\non a concrete floor which was attached to solid rock, which makes sensitivity due to\ntemperature changes of these magnitudes unlikely.\nVan Flandern and Yang [FlaY03] proposed that the setups of Allais and Saxl and\nAllen were sensitive to air currents due to pressure changes at the start of an eclipse.\nLiterature about atmospheric effects during eclipses show that these effects are lagging\nbehind the change of solar radiation and even that wind speed is reduced during eclipses\n[AndK75, FokW01, GirB01] and this conjecture is therefore not in occordance with the\nobservations.\n2.4. Tilt due to atmospheric loading\nIf a pressure increase occurs during the eclipse, as discussed in Section 2.2, this\nmight also induce a tilt due to deformation of the Earth's crust. According to Rabbel and\nZschau [RabZ85], maximum tilts of the order of 50 nrad are to be expected3, to small to\naccount for the observed effects (see also Section 3).\n2.5. Geomagnetic changes\n\nThere exist a number of reports about eclipse induced changes of the geomagnetic\nfield [Str01, BreL93, MalO00]. Athough this will be treated in more detail in the next\nversion of this paper, preliminary analysis show that it cannot explain the anomalous\neffects qualitatively. The reported magnitudes are at most 10 nT and therefore of the\nsame order as the diurnal changes of the geomagnetic field. Some articles even put\ngeomagnetic changes at the Earth's surface into question [KorL01].\nIt will be useful, however, to calculate the effect of 10 nT changes on the various\nequipment mentioned in this paper (see, e.g., [CheC93], pp. 45\u201348 for calculating\nmagnetic effects).\n\n3\n\nTilts due to tidal effects are of the order of 0.1 mrad.\n6/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\n2.6. Instrumental errors\nA lot of reports about eclipse anomalies either lack a statistical analysis and/or\nrecords of sufficient length in time. A preliminary analysis of the Saxl and Allen data\nshows that their effect is a 3s effect compared to normal daily changes in period\n[Dui05]. Also reports about measurements where no anomalous behaviour was found\nsometimes only show time windows which are barely larger than the eclipse event\n[Ruy03].\nThere are a multitude of causes which might seem to be able to explain disturbances\nof short duration, like one proposed by Van Ruymbeke et al.: \"An effect probably\ninduced by some electrical occurrence due to the special situation of night conditions\noccurring during the day\" [RuyS03]. Although the data of, e.g., Saxl and Allen\n[SaxA71] and Kuusela [Kuu92] also show some peaked deviations of many standard\ndeviations magnitude, it must be concluded that causes like those proposed by Van\nRuymbeke et al. cannot explain the general behaviour of the observations.\n\n3. Observations of tilt\nInteresting are observations of tilt during eclipses. Gu\u00e9rin and Gay [GueG99] already\nstressed the importance of these observations for resolving this enigma. Kuusela\nobserved changes in the angle of his pendulum in the direction approximately\nperpendicular to the path of the shadow (y-direction) with a maximum of 2 mrad which\nseem to be related to the eclipse [Kuu92], see Fig. 6. No such effect was observed in the\nx-direction.\nLatham describes measurements with a gyroscope during a solar eclipse in Western\nAustralia in 1974 [Lat80]. He did not observe any effect in the gyroscope output, but did\nobserve a tilt of the experimental platform in the E/W direction with a simultaneous\noperating tiltmeter of approx. 24 mrad. see Fig. 7. This is even an order of magnitude\nlarger than the value observed by Kuusela. It was rather puzzling that the gyroscope did\nnot show this rotation in its output. Latham also checked for changes in the value of g at\nthe time of the eclipse in the records of the observatory at Mundaring, Western\nAustralia, and found no indication of such an effect. It cannot be ruled out, however, that\nthe observation was due to an instrument error.\n\n7/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\nFig. 6. Deviations of the midpoint of the torsion balance of Kuusela during the 1991 eclipse in\nMexico [Kuu92]. Upper trace (red): y-direction, lower trace (black): x-direction. The y-direction\nis roughly in the direction of the path of the eclipse. The length of the pendulum wire was\n1.00 m. First contact at 11:54 h, maximum from 13:21-13:27 h, last contact at 14:47 h local time.\n\nAn explanation could be that an extra horizontal force is sometimes generated during\nan eclipse. Free hanging \"tilt meters\" like those of Latham and Kuusela are sensitive to\nsuch a force while most gravimeters are not (at least, not for forces of this magnitude).\nThis would also explain the lack of response of Latham's gyroscope, which was\nsufficiently sensitive to detect such a tilt [Lat80].\n\nFig. 7. Tilt as observed by R. Latham [Lat80] with a Talyval level during the June 20, 1974 solar\neclipse in Western Australia. Vertical axis is the tilt in the East-West directions in sec of arc.\nNote that subtracting a linear trendline and inverting gives the same shape as Figs. 3, 4 and 5.\n\nThe observations of Kuusela show that the occurrence of tilt does not necessarily\nhave an effect on the period of torsion pendulums. The Saxl and Allen pendulum had an\nother starting mechanism [SaxA80], however, so in principle it cannot be excluded that\nthis device did have such a sensitivity to tilt. Saxl et al. have examined the sensitivity of\ntheir torsion pendulum to tilt a few years after the eclipse observations. Their conclusion\nwas that horizontal movements of the pendulum disk of 0.1 mm would lead to a\n\n8/12\n\n\fC.P. Duif \u2013 gr-qc/0408023, v5\n\nmaximum change in period of 60 ms [SaxA80], while the observed changes during the\neclipse are two orders of magnitude larger. If we take the magnitude found by Latham\n(5\" \u2248 24 mrad), for the Saxl and Allen pendulum this would lead to a horizontal\ndisplacement of approx. 45 mm.\nGu\u00e9rin and Gay [GueG99] drew attention to the fact that the method of measurement\nof Allais with his paraconical pendulum4 is in principle sensitive to tilt. Savrov, who did\nnot observe anomalous behaviour with paraconical pendula5, used a method less\nsensitive to this error6 [Sav97]. The horizontal displacement for the Allais case will be at\nmost 20 mm, whereas Allais could read the position on the outer dial to a precision not\nbetter than 200 mm. This seems to rule out tilt of this magnitude as an explanation for\nthe observations of Allais.\n4. Conclusions and discussion\nAlthough, despite all proposed conventional explanations fail to explain the\nobservations either qualitatively or quantitatively, it is still possible that the reported\nanomalies will turn out to be due to a combination of some of these effects and\ninstrumental errors. And, of course, there may be yet unidentified conventional causes\nwhich play a role. The judgement of some of the experimental results is hampered by\nthe lack of a statistical analysis and/or data of sufficient length. Nevertheless, there exist\nsome strong data which cannot be easily explained away.\nTherefore, further experiments during a few solar eclipses are justified.\nMeasurements with a single device, however, seem to add little to the current situation.\nCombined measurements of several pendula and gravimeters together with monitoring\nof a variety of environmental parameters like seismic activity, ground tilt, atmospheric\npressure, temperature, ground water level, etc. are necessary. Also, more study of the\nsensitivity of these instruments to the environmental factors described above, will be\nuseful.\nIf an anomalous eclipse effect does exists, a clever combination of experiments and\ninput from theoretical models will be necessary to reveal its existence. It seems clear\nthat gravitational screening can be ruled out as theoretical explanation. Various studies\nhave set upperlimits on this mechanism which rule out effects of the order of the eclipse\nanomalies [UnnM01, Eck90, Edw02, Fla96, SliC65].\nThere seem to be no studies published which estimate the magnitude of generalrelativistic effects as possible cause for the observations. Comparison of, e.g., the\nmagnitude of gravitomagnetic effects [RugT02] with the magnitude of the eclipse\neffects make it unlikely that the eclipse effects can be explained within the framework of\nGeneral Relativity. Rather, it seems that one has to resort to gravitational theories which\ninclude preferred-location or preferred-frame effects (see, e.g., [Wil81], Section 6.3, for\nan account of these theories).\n\n4\n\nObserving the change in azimuth for 14 min and releasing the pendulum at the last observed\nangle.\n5\nFrom a recent article [Sav04], it can be inferred that he actually did observe an anomalous effect\nduring the 1991 eclipse in Mexico, but ascribed it to atmospheric effects without justification.\n6\nSavrov fitted the trajectory of the pendulum with an ellipse and measured the whole eclipse\n\"with one release\" of the pendulum.\n\n9/12\n\n\fC.P.
