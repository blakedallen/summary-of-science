Introduction\n1.1. This paper is a collaboration between a mathematician and a physicist. It is based on the observation\nthat renormalization of Feynman amplitudes in physics is closely related to the theory of limiting mixed\nHodge structures in mathematics. Whereas classical physical renormalization methods involve manipulations\nwith the integrand of a divergent integral, limiting Hodge theory involves moving the chain of integration so\nthe integral becomes convergent and studying the monodromy as the chain varies.\nEven methods like minimal subtraction in the contextRof dimensional or analytic regularization implicitly\nmodify the integrand through the definition of a measure dD k via analytic continuation. Still, as a regulator\ndimensional regularization is close to our approach in so far as it leaves the rational integrand assigned to a\ngraph unchanged. Minimal subtraction as a renormalization scheme differs though from the renormalization\nschemes which we consider -momentum subtractions essentially- by a finite renormalization. Many of the\nnice algebro-geometric structures developed below are not transparent in that scheme.\nThe advantages of the limiting Hodge method are firstly that it is linked to a very central and powerful\nprogram in mathematics: the study of Hodge structures and their variations. As a consequence, one gains\na number of tools, like weight, Hodge, and monodromy filtrations to study and classify the Feynman amplitudes. Secondly, the method depends on the integration chain, and hence on the graph, but it is in some\nsense independent of the integrand. For this reason it should adapt naturally e.g. to gauge theories where\nthe numerator of the integrand is complicated.\nAn important point is to analyse the nature of the poles. Limiting mixed Hodge structures demand that\nthe divergent subintegrals have at worst log poles. This does not imply that we can not apply our approach to\nperturbative amplitudes which have worse than logarithmic degree of divergence. It only means that we have\nto correctly isolate the polynomials in masses and external momenta which accompany those divergences such\nthat the corresponding integrands have singularities provided by log-poles. This is essentially automatic from\nthe notion of a residue available by our very methods. As a very pleasant byproduct, we learn that physical\nrenormalization schemes -on-shell subtractions, momentum subtractions, Weinberg's scheme,- belong to a\nclass of schemes for which this is indeed automatic.\nMoreover, for technical reasons, it is convenient to work with projective rather than affine integrals. One\nof the central physics results in this paper is that the renormalization problem can be reduced to the study\nof logarithmically divergent, projective integrals. This is again familiar from analytic regulators. The fact\nthat it can be achieved here by leaving the integrand completely intact will hopefully some fine day allow to\nunderstand the nature of the periods assigned to renormalized values in quantum field theory.\nA remark for Mathematicians: our focus in this paper has been renormalization, which is a problem\narising in physics. We suspect, however, that similar methods will apply more generally for example to\nperiod integrals whenever the domain of integration is contained in R+n and the integrand is a rational\nfunction with polar locus defined by a polynomial with non-negative real coefficients. The toric methods\nand the monodromy computations should go through in that generality.\nAcknowledgments.

This paper studies the renormalization problem in the context of parametric\nrepresentations, with an emphasis on algebro-geometric properties. We will not study the nature of the\n1\n\n\fperiods one obtains from renormalizable quantum field theories in an even dimension of space-time. Instead,\nwe provide the combinatorics of renormalization such that a future motivic analysis of renormalized amplitudes is feasible along the lines of [2]. Our result will in particular put renormalization in the framework\nof a limiting mixed Hodge structure, which hopefully provides a good starting point for an analysis of the\nperiods in renormalized amplitudes. That these amplitudes are provided by numbers which are periods (in\nthe sense of [11]) is an immediate consequence of the properties of parametric representations, and will also\nemerge naturally below (see Thm.(7.3)).\nThe main result of this paper is a careful study of the singularities of the first Kirchhoff\u2013Symanzik\npolynomial, which carries all the short-distance singularities of the theory. The study of this polynomial can\nproceed via an analysis with the help of projective integrals. Along the way, we will also give useful formulas\nfor parametric representations involving affine integrals, and clarify the role of the second Kirchhoff\u2013Symanzik\npolynomial for affine and projective integrals.\nOur methods are general, but in concrete examples we restrict ourselves to \u03c644 theory. Parametric representations are used which result from free-field propagators for propagation in flat space-time. In such\ncircumstances, the advantages of analytic regularizations are also available in our study of parametric representations as we will see. In particular, our use of projective integrals below combines such advantages\nwith the possibility to discuss renormalization on the level of the pairing between integration chains and de\nRham classes.\nIn examples, special emphasis is given to the study of particular renormalization schemes, the momentum\nscheme (MOM-scheme, Weinberg's scheme, on-shell subtractions).\nAlso, we often consider Green functions as functions of a single kinematical scale q 2 > 0. Green functions\nare defined throughout as the scalar coefficient functions (structure functions) for the radiative corrections\nto tree-level amplitudes r. They are to be regarded as scalar quantities of the form 1 + O(~). Renormalized\namplitudes are then, in finite order in perturbation theory, polynomial corrections in L = ln q 2 /\u03bc2 (\u03bc2 >\n0) without constant term, providing the quantum corrections to the tree-level amplitudes appearing as\nmonomials in a renormalizable Lagrangian [15]:\naug(\u0393)\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c6R (\u0393) =\n\nX\n\npj (\u0393)Lj .\n\nj=1\n\nCorrespondingly, Green functions become triangular series in two variables\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\ncrj (L)\u03b1j .\n\u03b3jr (\u03b1)Lj = 1 +\n(1.2)\nGr (\u03b1, L) = 1 +\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b3jr (\u03b1)\n\nThe series\nare related by the renormalization group which leaves only the \u03b31r (\u03b1) undetermined, while\nthe polynomials crj (L) are bounded in degree by j. The series \u03b31r fulfill ordinary differential equations driven\nby the primitive graphs of the theory [16].\nThe limiting Hodge structure A(\u0393) which we consider for each Feynman graph \u0393 provides contribution of\na graph \u0393 to the coefficients of \u03b31r in the limit. This limit is a period matrix (a column vector here) which\nhas, from top to bottom, the periods provided by a renormalized graph \u0393 as entries. The first entry is the\ncontribution to \u03b31r of a graph with res(\u0393) = r and the k-th is a rational multiple of the contribution to \u03b3kr . In\nsection 9.1 we determine the rational weights which connect these periods to the coefficients pj (\u0393) attributed\nto the renormalization of a graph \u0393.\nWe include a discussion of the structure of renormalization which comes from an analysis of the second\nKirchhoff\u2013Symanzik polynomial. While this polynomial does not provide short-distance singularities in its\nown right, it leads to integrals of the form\nZ\n(1.3)\n\u03c9 ln(f )\n\nfor a renormalized Feynman amplitude, with \u03c9 a de Rham class determined by the first Kirchhoff\u2013Symanzik\npolynomial, and f -congruent to one along any remaining exceptional divisor- determined by the second.\nWe do not actually do the monodromy calculation for integrals (1.3) involving a logarithm, but it will be\nsimilar to the calculation for (1.5) which we do. A full discussion of the Hodge structure of a Green function\nseems feasible but will be postponed to future work.\n2\n\n\fX\nL\n\nFigure 1. Picture of X and L\n1.3. Math Introduction. Let Pn\u22121 be the projective space of lines in Cn which we view as an algebraic\nvariety with homogeneous coordinates A1 , . . . , An . Let \u03c8(A1 , . . . , An ) be a homogeneous polynomial of some\ndegree d, and let X \u2282 Pn\u22121 be the hypersurface defined by \u03c8 = 0. We assume the coefficients of \u03c8 are all\nreal and \u2265 0. Let \u03c3 = {[a1 , . . . , an ] | ai \u2265 0, \u2200i} be the topological (n \u2212 1)-chain (simplex) in Pn\u22121 , where\n[. . .] refers to homogeneous coordinates. We will also use the notation \u03c3 = Pn\u22121 (R\u22650 ). Our assumption\nabout coefficients implies\n[\n(1.4)\n\u03c3\u2229X =\nL(R\u22650 ),\nL\u2282X\n\nwhere L runs through all coordinate coordinate linear spaces L : Ai1 = * * * = Aip = 0 contained in X (see\n(see Fig.1)). The genesis of the renormalization problem in physics is the need to assign values to integrals\nZ\n(1.5)\n\u03c9\n\u03c3\n\nn\u22121\n\nwhere \u03c9 is an algebraic (n\u22121)-form on P\nwith poles along X. The problem is an important one for physical\napplications, and there is an extensive literature (see, for example, [10, 22, 21]) focusing on practical formulae\nto reinterpret (1.5) in some consistent way as a polynomial in log t.R (Here t parametrizes a deformation of\n\u221e\nthe integration chain. As a first approximation, one can think of t \u03c9 when \u03c9 has a logarithmic pole at\nt = 0.)\nA similar problem arises in pure mathematics in the study of degenerating varieties, e.g. a family of elliptic\ncurves degenerating to a rational curve with a node. In the classical setup, one is given a family f : X \u2192 D,\nwhere D is a disk with parameter t. The map f is proper (so the fibres Xt are compact). X is assumed to\nbe non-singular, as are the fibres Xt , t 6= 0. X0 may be singular, though one commonly invokes resolution of\nsingularities to assume X0 \u2282 X is a normal crossing divisor. Choose a basis \u03c31,t , . . . , \u03c3r,t for the homology\nof the fibre Hp (Xt , Q) in some fixed degree p. By standard results in differential topology, the fibre space is\nlocally topologically trivial over D\u2217 = D \u2212 {0}, and we may choose the classes \u03c3i,t to be locally constant.\nIf we fix a smooth fibre t0 6= 0, the monodromy transformation m : Hp (Xt0 ) \u2192 Hp (Xt0 ) is obtained by\nwinding around t = 0. An important theorem ([7], III,2) says this transformation is quasi-unipotent, i.e.\nafter possibly introducing a root t\u2032 = t1/n (which has the effect of replacing m by mn ), m \u2212 id is nilpotent.\nThe matrix\nh\ni\n(1.6)\nN := log m = \u2212 (id \u2212 m) + (id \u2212 m)2 /2 + . . .\n3\n\n\fis thus also nilpotent. This is the mathematical equivalent of locality in physics. It insures that our\nrenormalization of (1.5) will be a polynomial in log t rather than an infinite series. We take a cohomology class\n[\u03c9t ] \u2208 H p (Xt , C) which varies algebraically. For example, in a family of elliptic curves y 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 t),\nthe holomorphic 1-form \u03c9t = dx/y is such a class. Note \u03c9t is single-valued over all of D\u2217 . It is not locally\nconstant. The expression\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ebR\n\u03c9\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u03c31,t t\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(1.7)\nexp \u2212 (N log t)/2\u03c0i \uf8ed ... \uf8f8 .\nR\n\u03c9\n\u03c3r,t t\n\nis then single-valued and analytic on D\u2217 . Suppose \u03c9t chosen such that the entries of the column vector in\n(1.7) grow at worst like powers of | log |t|| as |t| \u2192 0. A standard result in complex analysis then implies\nthat (1.7) is analytic at t = 0. We can write this\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ebR\n\u03c9\n\u03c31,t t\n\u0010\n\u0011 a1\n\uf8ec.\uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n(1.8)\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8 \u223c exp (N log t)/2\u03c0i \uf8ed .. \uf8f8 .\nR\nar\n\u03c3r,t \u03c9t\n\nHere the aj are constants which are periods of a limiting Hodge structure. The exponential on the right\nexpands as a matrix whose entries are polynomials in log t, and the equivalence relation \u223c means that the\ndifference between the two sides is a column vector of (multi-valued) analytic\nfunctions vanishing at t = 0.\nQn\nWe would like to apply this program to the integral (1.5). Let \u2206 : 1 Aj = 0 be the coordinate divisor\nin Pn\u22121 . Note that the chain \u03c3 has boundary in \u2206, so as a first attempt to interpret (1.5) as a period, we\nmight consider the pairing\n(1.9)\n\nH n\u22121 (Pn\u22121 \u2212 X, \u2206 \u2212 X \u2229 \u2206) \u00d7 Hn\u22121 (Pn\u22121 \u2212 X, \u2206 \u2212 X \u2229 \u2206) \u2192 C\n\nThe form \u03c9 is an algebraic (n \u2212 1)-form and it vanishes on \u2206 for degree reasons, so it does give a class in\nthe relative cohomology group appearing in (1.9) (see the discussion (9.8)-(9.10)). On the other hand, the\nchain \u03c3 meetsQX (1.4), so we do not get a class in homology. Instead we consider a family of coordinate\nn\ndivisors \u2206t : 1 Aj,t = 0 with \u22060 = \u2206. (For details, see section 6.) For t = \u03b5 > 0 there is Ra natural chain\n\u03c3\u03b5 which is what the physicists would call a cutoff. We have \u2202\u03c3\u03b5 \u2282 \u2206\u03b5 and \u03c3\u03b5 \u2229 X = \u2205, so \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c9 is defined.\nOne knows on abstract grounds that the monodromy of\nHn\u22121 (Pn\u22121 \u2212 X, \u2206t \u2212 X \u2229 \u2206t )\nis quasi-unipotent as above ([7], III,\u00a72). The main mathematical work in this paper will be to compute the\nmonodromy of \u03c3\u03b5 in the specific case of Feynman amplitudes in physics. More precisely, X will be a graph\nhypersurface X\u0393 associated to a graph \u0393 (section 5). We will write down chains \u03c4\u03b3\u03b5 , one for each flag of core\n(one particle irreducible in physics) subgraphs \u03b3 = {\u03931 ( * * * \u0393p(\u03b3) ( \u0393}, representing linearly independent\nhomology classes in Hn\u22121 (Pn\u22121 \u2212 X, \u2206\u03b5 \u2212 X \u2229 \u2206\u03b5 ). (The combinatorics here is similar to that found in [1],\n[18].) We will show the monodromy in our case is given by\nX\n(1.10)\nm(\u03c3\u03b5 ) = \u03c3\u03b5 +\n(\u22121)p(\u03b3) \u03c4\u03b3\u03b5 .\n\u03b3\n\nWe will then exhibit a nilpotent matrix N such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03c3\u03b5\nm(\u03c3\u03b5 )\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ec.\uf8f7\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(1.11)\n\uf8ecm(\u03c4\u03b3\u03b5 )\uf8f7 = exp(N ) \uf8ec\u03c4\u03b3\u03b5 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\nWith this in hand, renormalization is automatic for any physical theory for which \u0393 and its subgraphs are\nat worst logarithmically divergent after taking out suitable polynomials in masses and momenta. Namely,\n4\n\n\fsuch a physical theory gives a differential form \u03c9\u0393 as in (1.5) and we may repeat the above argument:\n\uf8ebR\n\uf8f6\n\u03c9\n\u03c3t\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n(1.12)\nexp(\u2212(N log t)/2\u03c0i) \uf8ecR \u03c9 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u03c4\u03b3t \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n..\n.\n\nis single-valued on the punctured disk. The hypothesis of log divergence at worst for subgraphs of \u0393 will\nimply that the integrals will grow at worst like a power of log as |t| \u2192 0,(lemma 9.2). Precisely as in (1.8),\none gets the renormalization\nZ\nr\nX\n\u03c9\u0393 =\nbk (log t)k + O(t),\n(1.13)\n\u03c3t\n\nk=0\n\nwhere O(t) denotes a (multi-valued) analytic function vanishing at t = 0. The renormalization schemes\nconsidered here can be characterized by the condition b0 = 0.\nOf course, the requirement that a physical theory have at worst log divergences is a very strong constraint.\nThe difficult computations in section 7 show how general divergences encountered in physics can be reduced\nto log divergences.\nRemarks 1.1. The renormalization scheme outlined above, and worked out in detail in the following sections, has a number of properties, some of which may seem strange to the physicist.\n(i) It does not work in renormalization schemes which demand counter-terms which are not defined by subtractions at fixed values of masses and momenta of the theory. So conditions on the regulator for example, as\nin minimal subtraction where one defines the counterterm by projection onto a pole part, are not considered.\nIn such schemes, and for graphs which are worse than log divergent, a topological procedure of the sort given\nhere can not work. It is necessary instead to modify the integrand \u03c9\u0393 in a non-canonical way.\n(ii) On the other hand, our approach is very canonical. It depends on the choice of a parameter t, as any\nrenormalization scheme must. Somewhat more subtle is the dependence on the monodromy associated to the\nchoice of a family \u2206t of coordinate divisors deforming the given \u2206 = \u22060 . We have taken the most evident\nsuch monodromy, moving all the vertices of the simplex. Note that this choice is stable in the sense that a\nsmall deformation leaves the monodromy unchanged.\n(iii) It would seem that our answer is much more complicated than need be, because \u0393 will in general\ncontain far more core subgraphs than divergent subgraphs. For example, in \u03c64 -theory, the \"dunce's cap\"\n(see Fig.2) has only one divergent subgraph, given in the picture by edges 1, 2. It has 3 core subgraphs\n(3, 4, 1), (3, 4, 2), (1, 2). RFrom the point of view of renormalization, this problem disappears. The \u03c4\u03b3\u03b5 are\ntubes, and the integral \u03c4 \u03b5 \u03c9\u0393 is basically a residue which will vanish unless \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 is a divergent subgraph.\n\u03b3\n\nIn (1.12), the column vector of integrals will consist mostly of 0's and the final regularization (1.13) will\ninvolve only divergent subgraphs.\n(iv) An important property of the theory is the presence of a limiting mixed Hodge structure. The constants\non the right hand side of (1.8) are periods of a mixed Hodge structure called the limiting MHS for the\ndegeneration. One may hope that the tendency for Feynman amplitudes to be multi-zeta numbers [4] will\nsome day be understood in terms of this Hodge structure. From the point of view of this paper, the vector\nspace W \u2282 Hn\u22121 (Pn\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 , \u2206t \u2212 X\u0393 \u2229 \u2206t ) spanned by \u03c3t and the \u03c4\u03b3t is invariant under the monodromy.\nOne may ask whether the image of W in the limiting MHS spans a sub-Hodge structure. If so, we would\nexpect that this HS would be linked to the multi-zeta numbers. Note that W is highly non-trivial even when\n\u0393 has no subdivergences. This W is an essentially new invariant which comes out of the monodromy. See\nsection (9.2) for a final discussion of our viewpoint.\n(v) There are a number of renormalization schemes in physics, some of which are not compatible with our\napproach. One general test is that our scheme depends only on the graph polynomials of \u0393. For example,\nsuppose \u0393 = \u03931 \u222a \u03932 where the \u0393i meet at a single vertex. Then the renormalization polynomial in log t our\ntheory yields for \u0393 will be the product of the renormalizations for the \u0393i .\n\nMost of the mathematical work involved concerns the calculation of monodromy for a particular topological\nR\u221e\nchain. It is perhaps worth taking a minute to discuss a toy model. Suppose one wants to calculate 0 \u03c9,\n5\n\n\f3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. Dunce's cap. Here and in following figures, external half-edges are often not\ndrawn and are determined by the requirement that all vertices are four-valent.\nR\u221e\ndz\n. The integral diverges, so instead we consider t \u03c9 as a function of t = \u03b5ei\u03b8 for 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0.\nwhere \u03c9 = (z\u2212i)z\nIf we take the path [t, \u221e] to be a great circle, then as t winds around 0, the path will get tangled in the\nsingularity of \u03c9 at z = i. Assuming we do not understand the singularities of our integral far from 0, this\ncould be a problem. Instead we chose our path to follow the small circle from \u03b5ei\u03b8 to \u03b5 and then the positive\nreal axis from \u03b5 to \u221e. The variation of monodromy is the difference in the paths for \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0.\nIn this case, it is the circle {|t| = \u03b5}. If we assume something (at worst superficial log divergence for the\ngiven graph and all subgraphs in the given physical theory) about the behavior of \u03c9 near the pole at 0, then\nthe behavior of our integral for |t| << 1 is determined by this monodromy, which is a topological invariant.\nThis is quite different from the usual approach in physics involving complicated algebraic manipulations\nwith \u03c9. A glance at fig.(10) suggests that our toy model is too simple. We have to work with two scales,\n\u03b5 << \u03b7 << 1. This is because in the more complicated situation, we have to deal with cylinders of small\nradius \u03b7, but then we have further to slightly deform the boundaries of the cylinder (cf. fig.(12)).\n1.4. Leitfaden. Section 2 is devoted to Hopf algebras of graphs and of trees. These have played a central\nrole in the combinatorics of renormalization. In particular, the insight afforded by passing from graphs\nto trees is important. Since the combinatorics of core subgraphs is even more complicated than that of\ndivergent subgraphs, it seemed worth going carefully through the construction. Section 3 studies the toric\nvariety we obtain from a graph \u0393 by blowing up certain coordinate linear spaces in the projective space with\nhomogeneous coordinates labeled by the edges of \u0393. The orbits of the torus action are related to flags of core\nsubgraphs of the given graph. In section 4, we use the R-structure on our toric variety to construct certain\ntopological chains which will be used to explicit the monodromy. Section 5 recalls the basic properties of\nthe graph polynomial \u03c8\u0393 \u2261 \u03c8(\u0393) and the graph hypersurface X\u0393 : \u03c8\u0393 = 0. The crucial point is corollary 5.3\nwhich says that the strict transform of X\u0393 on our toric blowup avoids points with coordinates \u2265 0. Any chain\nwe construct which stays close to the locus of such points necessarily is away from X\u0393 and hence also away\nfrom the polar locus of our integrand. Section 6 computes the monodromy of our chain. Section 7 considers\nhow to reduce Feynman amplitude calculations as they arise in physics, including masses and momenta as\nwell as divergences which are worse than logarithmic, to the basic situation where limiting methods can\napply. In section 8 we calculate the nilpotent matrix N which is the log of the monodromy transformation,\nand in section 9 we prove the main renormalization theorem in the log divergent case, to which we have\nreduced the theory.\n6\n\n\f2. Hopf algebras of trees and graphs\n2.1. Graphs. In this section we bring together material on graphs and the graph Hopf algebra which will\nbe used in the sequel. We also discuss Hopf algebras related to rooted trees and prove a result (proposition\n2.5) relating the Hopf algebra of core graphs to a suitable Hopf algebra of labeled trees. Strictly speaking\nthis is not used in the paper, but it provides the best way we know to understand flags of core subgraphs,\nand these play a central role in the monodromy computations. Trees labeled by divergent subgraphs have a\nlong history in renormalization theory [12], [13].\nA graph \u0393 is determined by giving a finite set HE(\u0393) of half-edges, together with two further sets E(\u0393)\n(edges) and V (\u0393) (vertices) and surjective maps\n(2.1)\n\npV : HE(\u0393) \u2192 V ;\n\npE : HE(\u0393) \u2192 E.\n\n(Note we do not allow isolated vertices.) In combinatorics, one typically assumes all fibres p\u22121\nE (e) consist of\nexactly two half-edges (e an internal edge), while in physics the calculus of path integrals and correlation\nfunctions dictates that one admit external edges e \u2208 E with #p\u22121\nE (e) = 1. If all internal edges of \u0393 are\nshrunk to 0, the resulting graph (with no internal edges) is called the residue res(\u0393). In certain theories, the\nvertices are decomposed into different types V = \u2210Vi , and the valence of the vertices in Vi , #p\u22121\nV (v), is fixed\nindependent of v \u2208 Vi .\nWe will typically work with labeled graphs which are triples (\u0393, A, \u03c6 : A \u223c\n= E(\u0393)). We refer to A as the\nset of edges.\nA graph is a topological space with Betti numbers |\u0393| = h1 (\u0393) = dim H1 (\u0393, Q) and h0 (\u0393). We say \u0393 is\nconnected if h0 = 1. Sometimes h1 is referred to as the loop number.\nA subgraph \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 is determined (for us) by a subset E(\u03b3) \u2282 E(\u0393). We write \u0393//\u03b3 for the quotient\ngraph obtained by contracting all edges of \u03b3 to points. If \u03b3 is not connected, \u0393//\u03b3 is different from the naive\nquotient \u0393/\u03b3. If \u03b3 = \u0393, we take \u0393//\u0393 = \u2205 to be the empty set. It will be convenient when we discuss Hopf\nalgebras below to have the empty set as a graph.\nAlso, for \u03b3 = e a single edge, we have the contraction \u0393//e = \u0393/e. In this case we also consider the cut\ngraph \u0393 \u2212 e obtained by removing e and also any remaining isolated vertex.\nA graph \u0393 is said to be core (1P I in physics terminology) if for any edge e we have |\u0393 \u2212 e| < |\u0393|.\nA cycle \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 is a core subgraph such that |\u03b3| = 1. If \u0393 is core, it can be written as a union of cycles (see\ne.g. the proof of lemma 7.4 in [2]).\n2.1.1. Self-energy graphs. Special care has to be taken when the residue res(\u03b3) of a connected component\n\u03b3 of some subgraph consists of two half-edges connected to a vertex, |res(\u03b3)| = 2. Such graphs are called\nself-energy graphs in physics. In such a situation, if the internal edges of \u03b3 contract to a point, we are left\nwith two edges in \u0393//\u03b3, which are connected at this point u . It might happen that the theory provides more\nthan one two-point vertex. In fact, for a massive theory, there are two two-point vertices provided by the\ntheory corresponding to the two monomials in the Lagrangian quadratic in the fields, we call them of mass\nand kinetic type. \u0393//\u03b3 represents then a sum over two graphs by summing over the two types of vertices for\nthat point u. (see Fig.(3) for an example).\nThe edges and vertices of various types have weights. We set the weight of an edge to be two, the weight\nof a vertex with valence greater than two is zero, the weight of a vertex of mass type is zero, the weight of\nthe kinetic type is +2.\nThen, the superficial degree of divergence sdd(\u0393) for a connected core graph \u0393 is\n(2.2)\n\nsdd(\u0393) = 4|\u0393| \u2212 2|\u0393[1] | + 2|\u0393[0],kin|,\n\nwhere \u0393[0],kin is the set of vertices of kinetic type, and \u0393[1] the set of internal edges. \u0393[0] , the set of interaction\nvertices (for which we assume we have only one type) does not show up as they have weight zero, nor does\n\u0393[0],mass . By | * * * | we denote the cardinality of these sets.\nNote that a graph \u0393//\u03b3 which has one two-point vertex labeled m2 (of mass type) which appears after\ncontracting a self-energy subgraph \u03b3 has an improved power-counting as its edge number is 2h1 (\u0393//\u03b3) + 1. If\nthe two-point vertex is labeled by \u0003 (kinetic type), it has not changed though: sdd(\u0393//\u03b3) = sdd(\u0393), as the\nweight of the two-point vertex compensates for the weight of the extra propagator. Quite often, in massless\ntheories, one then omits the use of these two-point vertices altogether.\n7\n\n\f6\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n6\n5\n\n2\n\nu\n\n3\n\nX\n\n4\n1\n\nFigure 3. This vertex graph has a propagator correction given by edges 4, 5, 6. The nontrivial part of the coproduct then delivers on the left the subgraph with internal edges 4, 5, 6\namongst other terms. The coproduct on the right has a co-graph on edges 1, 2, 3. There is\na two-point vertex u between edges 2, 3. Choosing two labels u = m2 or u = \u0003 allows to\ndistinguish between mass and wave-function renormalization. We remind the reader that\nthe corresponding monomials in the Lagrangian are m2 \u03c62 /2 and \u03c6\u0003\u03c6/2.\n2.2. Hopf algebras of graphs. Let P be a class of graphs. We assume \u2205 \u2208 P and that \u0393 \u2208 P and \u0393\u2032 \u223c\n=\u0393\nimplies \u0393\u2032 \u2208 P. We say P is closed under extension if given \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 we have\n(2.3)\n\n\u03b3, \u0393 \u2208 P \u21d4 \u03b3, \u0393//\u03b3 \u2208 P.\n\nEasy examples of such classes of graphs are P = core graphs, and P = log divergent graphs, where \u0393 is\nlog divergent (in \u03c644 theory) if it is core and if further #E(\u0393i ) = 2|\u0393i | for every connected component \u0393i \u2282 \u0393.\n(Both examples are closed under extension by virtue of the identity |\u03b3| + |\u0393//\u03b3| = |\u0393|.) Examples which arise\nin physical theories are more subtle. Verification of (2.3) requires an analysis of which graphs can arise from\na given Lagrangian. To verify P = {\u0393 | sdd(\u0393) \u2265 0} satisfies (2.3) one must consider self-energy graphs and\nthe role of vertices of kinetic type as discussed above.\nIn particular, in massless \u03c644 theory divergent graphs are closed under extension, and so is the class of\ngraphs for which 4|\u0393|\u22122|\u0393[1]|+2|\u0393[0],kin|+2|\u0393[0],mass | \u2265 0. Note that this may contain superficially convergent\ngraphs if there are sufficiently many two-point vertices of mass type. It pays to include them in the class of\ngraphs to be considered, which enables one to discuss the effect of mass in the renormalization group flow.\nAssociated to a class P which is closed under extension as above, we define a (commutative, but not\ncocommutative) Hopf algebra H = HP as follows. As a vector space, H is freely spanned by isomorphism\nclasses of graphs in P. (A number of variants are possible. One may work with oriented graphs, for\nexample. In this case, the theory of graph homology yields a (graded commutative) differential graded Hopf\nalgebra. One may also rigidify by working with disjoint unions of subgraphs of a given labeled graph.) H\nbecomes a commutative algebra with 1 = [\u2205] and product given by disjoint union. Define a comultiplication\n\u2206 : H \u2192 H \u2297 H:\nX\n(2.4)\n\u2206(\u0393) =\n\u03b3 \u2297 \u0393//\u03b3.\n\u03b3\u2282\u0393\n\u03b3\u2208P\n\nOne checks that (2.3) implies that (2.4) is coassociative. Since H is graded by loop numbers and each Hn\nis finite dimensional, the theory of Hopf algebras guarantees the existence of an antipode, so H is a Hopf\nalgebra.\n8\n\n\f3\n\n4\n6\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n\nFigure 4. In Eq.(2.6), we give the coproduct for this wheel with three spokes in the core\nHopf algebra.\n\nIf P \u2032 \u2282 P with Hopf algebras H \u2032 , H ( e.g. take P to be core graphs, and P \u2032 \u2282 P divergent core graphs) then\nthe map H \u0589 H \u2032 obtained by sending \u0393 7\u2192 0 if \u0393 6\u2208 P \u2032 is a homomorphism of Hopf algebras. For example, the\ndivergent Hopf algebra carries the information needed for renormalization [13], while the core Hopf algebra\nHC determines the monodromy. In terms of groupschemes, one has Spec (Hlog. div. ) \u0592\u2192 Spec (HC ) is a closed\nsubgroupscheme, and renormalization can be viewed as a morphism from the affine line with coordinate L\nto Spec (Hlog. div. ). Already here we use that for divergent graphs with sdd(\u0393) > 0, we can evaluate them\nas polynomials in masses and external momenta with coefficients determined from log divergent graphs, see\nbelow.\nLet \u0393i , i = 1, 2 be core graphs (a similar discussion will be valid for other classes of graphs) and let vi \u2208 \u0393i\nbe vertices. Let \u0393 = \u03931 \u222a \u03932 where the two graphs are joined by identifying v1 \u223c v2 . Then \u0393 is core (cf.\nproposition 3.2). Further, core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393 all arise as the image of \u0393\u20321 \u2210 \u0393\u20322 \u2192 \u0393 for \u0393\u2032i \u2282 \u0393i core.\nThus\n\u0010X\n\u0011\u0010 X\n\u0011\nX\n(2.5) \u2206(\u0393) =\n\u0393\u2032 \u2297 \u0393//\u0393\u2032 =\n\u0393\u20321 \u2297 \u03931 //\u0393\u20321\n\u0393\u20322 \u2297 \u03932 //\u0393\u20322 +\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nX\n\u0393\u2032 \u2297 \u0393//\u0393\u2032 \u2212 \u03931 //\u0393\u20321 * \u03932 //\u0393\u20322 .\n(\u0393\u2032 \u2212 \u0393\u20321 * \u0393\u20322 ) \u2297 (\u03931 //\u0393\u20321 * \u03932 //\u0393\u20322 ) +\nIt follows that the vector space I \u2282 HC spanned by elements \u0393 \u2212 \u03931 * \u03932 as above satisfies \u2206(I) \u2282 I \u2297 HC +\nHC \u2297 I. Since I is an ideal, we see that H C := HC /I is a commutative Hopf algebra. Roughly speaking, H C\nis obtained from HC by identifying one vertex reducible graphs with products of the component pieces.\nGeneralization to theories with more vertex and edge types are straightforward.\nFig.(4) gives the wheel with three spokes. This graph, which in \u03c64 theory (external edges to be added such\nthat each vertex is four-valent) has a residue 6\u03b6(3) for conceptual reasons [2], has a coproduct (we omit edge\nlabels and identify terms which are identical under this omission, which gives the indicated multiplicities)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(2.6)\n\n\uf8ec\n\u2206\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8=\n\n\u2297\n\nI\n\n+I \u2297\n\n+4\n\n\u2297\n\n+3\n\n\u2297\n\n6\n\n\u2297\n9\n\n.\n\n\fFor example, the three possible labelings for the four-edge cycle in the third line are 4523, 5631 and 6412.\nWhile the graph has a non-trivial coproduct in the core Hopf algebra, it is a primitive element in the\nrenormalization Hopf algebra. It is tempting to hope that the core coproduct relates to the Hodge structure\nunderlying the period which appears in the residue of this graph.\n2.3. Rooted tree Hopf algebras [12], [3]. We introduce the Hopf algebra of decorated non-planar rooted\ntrees HT using non-empty finite sets as decorations (decorations will be sets of edge labels of Feynman graphs\nbelow) to label the vertices of the rooted tree Hopf algebra HT (\u2205). Products in HT are disjoint unions of\ntrees (forests). We write the coproduct as\nX\n(2.7)\n\u2206(T ) = T \u2297 I + I \u2297 T +\nP C (T ) \u2297 RC (T ).\nadmissible cuts C\n\nEdges are oriented away from the root and a vertex which has no outgoing edge we call a foot. An admissible\ncut is a subset of edges of a tree such that no path from the root to any vertex of T traverses more than one\nelement of that subset. Such a cut C separates T into at least 2 components. The component containing\nthe root is denoted RC (T ), and the product of the other components is P C (T ).\nA ladder is a tree without side branching. Decorated ladders generate a sub-Hopf algebra LT \u2282 HT . A\ngeneral element in LT is a sum of bamboo forests, that is disjoint unions of ladders. Decorated ladders have\nan associative shuffle product\nX\nL(k)\n(2.8)\nL1 \u22c6 L2 :=\nk\u2208shuffle(l1 ,l2 )\n\nwhere li denotes the ordered set of decorations for Li and shuffle(l1 , l2 ) is the set of all ordered sets obtained\nby shuffling together l1 and l2 .\nLemma 2.1.

For a flag f let f (p) be the bottom p vertices with the given labeling, and let f(p) be the top n \u2212 p\nvertices with the quotient labeling gotten by contracting the core graph associated to the bottom p vertices.\nFor \u03b3 \u2282 \u0393 a core subgraph, define F (\u0393, \u03b3) := {f \u2208 F (\u0393) | \u03b3 \u2208 f }.

We can\nP write\n\u0393 = \u0393(j) in such a way that all the \u0393(j) are core and one vertex irreducible,\nand\nsuch\nthat\n|\u0393|\n=\n|\u0393(j) |.\nQ\n(j)\n(j)\nThis decomposition is unique. If it is nontrivial, we define T (f ) = T (f ) where f is the induced flag\nfrom f on \u0393(j) . We now may assume \u0393 is one vertex irreducible. If the \u0393i in our flag are all one vertex\nirreducible, we take T (f ) = L(f ) to be a ladder as above. Otherwise, let m < n be maximal such that\n\u0393m ( \u0393 is one vertex reducible. By induction, we have a forest T (f |\u0393m ). To define T (f ), we glue the foot\nof the ladder with decorations \u0393m+1 \u2212 \u0393m , . . . , \u0393 \u2212 \u0393n\u22121 to all the roots of T (f |\u0393m ). (For an example, see\nfigs.(6) and (7).)\nS\nP\nLemma 2.4. Let \u0393 = \u0393(j) where \u0393 and the \u0393(j) are core. Assume |\u0393| = j |\u0393(j) |. Then, viewing flags\nf \u2208 F (\u0393) as sets of core subgraphs, ordered by inclusion, there is a 1 \u2212 1 correspondence between F (\u0393) and\nshuffles of the F (\u0393(j) ).\nProof. One checks easily that the \u0393(j) can have no edges in common. Further, there is a 1 \u2212 1 correspondence\nbetween core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393 andScollections of core subgraphs \u0393(j)\u2032 \u2282 \u0393(j) .

The last tree represents a sum of two\nflags, 34 ( 3456 ( 123456 + 56 ( 3456 ( 123456, again indicating graphs by edge labels.\nHence that tree corresponds to a sum of two ladders, as it should.\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n5\n\n6\n\n1\nd or c\n\n12\n\n12\n\nc or d +\n\n56 +\n\n34\n\n1a2b\n\n34\n\nd or c\n\n12\n\nc or d +\n\n34 +\n\n56\n\n12ab\n\n56\n\n34\n\n12\n\n56\n\nFigure 7. The two graphs differ in how the subdivergences are inserted. a, c \u2208 3, 4, and\nb, d \u2208 5, 6, c 6= a, b 6= d. So there are eight such legal trees, plus the two which are\nidentical between the two graphs. Note the permutation of labels at the feet of the trees\nin \u03c1(\u0393): 1a2b \u2194 12ab. Keeping that order, we can uniquely reconstruct each graph from\nthe knowledge of the labels at the feet: 1a2b, 34, 56 and 12ab, 34, 56, which are the cycles in\neach graph. Note that in the difference of the two graphs, only the difference of those eight\ntrees remains, corresponding to a primitive element in the renormalization Hopf algebra.\nThe core Hopf algebra hence stores much more information than the renormalization Hopf\nalgebra, which we hope to use in the future to understand the periods assigned to Feynman\ngraphs by the Feynman rules.\nAs a consequence of lemma 2.4 we may partition the flags F (\u0393) associated to a core \u0393 as follows. Given\nf \u2208 F (\u0393), Let \u0393m \u2282 \u0393 be maximal in the flag f such that \u0393m is 1-vertex reducible. The flag f induces a\nS (j)\n(j)\n(j)\nflag fm on \u0393m , and we know that it is a shuffle of flags fm on \u0393m where \u0393m = \u0393m as in the lemma. We\nsay two flags are equivalent, f \u223c f \u2032 , if f and f \u2032 agree at \u0393m and above, and if they simply correspond to\n(j)\ntwo different shuffles of the flags fm . We now have\nX\n(2.33)\nT (f ) \u2261\nL(f \u2032 ) mod J .\nf \u2032 \u223cf\n\nl\nIndeed, T (f ) is obtained by successive B+\noperations applied to the forest T (f |\u0393m ). The latter, by remark\n2.2, coincides with the righthand side of (2.33). We conclude\n\nProposition 2.5.

We will barely use HT in the\nfollowing, and introduced it for completeness and the benefit of the reader used to it.\n2.4. Renormalization Hopf algebras. In a similar manner, one may define homomorphisms\n\u03c1 R : HR \u2192 H T\n\n(2.35)\n\nfor any one of the renormalization Hopf algebras obtained by imposing restrictions on external leg structure.\nFor a graph \u0393, let, as before, the residue of \u0393, res(\u0393), be the graph with no loops obtained by shrinking all\nits internal edges to a point. What remains are the external half edges connected to that point (cf. section\n2.1). Note that \"doubling\" an edge by putting a two-point vertex in it does not change the residue.\nIn \u03c644 theory for example, graphs have 2m external legs, with m \u2265 0. For a renormalizable theory, there\nis a finite set of external leg structures R such that we obtain a renormalization Hopf algebra for that set.\nFor example, for massive \u03c644 theory, there are three such structures: the four-point vertex, and two\ntwo-point vertices, of kinetic type and mass type.\nLet us now consider flags associated to core graphs. Such chains * * * \u0393i ( \u0393i+1 ( * * * ( \u0393 correspond to\ndecorated ladders, and the coproduct on the level of such ladders is a sum over all possibilities to cut an\nedge in such a ladder, splitting the chain\n[* * * ( \u0393i ] \u2297 [\u0393i+1 //\u0393i ( * * * ( \u0393//\u0393i ].\n\n(2.36)\n\nSo let us call such an admissible cut renormalization-admissible, if all core graphs \u0393i , \u0393//\u0393i obtained by\nthe cut have residues in R.\nThe set of renormalization-admissible cuts is a subset of the admissible cuts of a core graph, and the\ncoproduct respects this. Hence the renormalization Hopf algebra HR is a quotient Hopf algebra of the core\nHopf algebra.\nIf we enlarge the set R to include other local field operators appearing for example in an operator product\nexpansion we get quotient Hopf algebras between the core and the renormalization Hopf algebra.\n2.5. External leg structures. External edges are usually labeled by data which characterize the amplitude\nunder consideration. Let \u03c3 be such data. For graphs \u0393 with a given residue res(\u0393), there is a finite set\n\u03c4 \u2208 {\u03c3}res(\u0393) of possible data \u03c4 . A choice of such data determines a labeling of the corresponding vertex to\nwhich a subgraph shrinks. Let \u0393//\u03b3\u03c4 be that co-graph with the corresponding vertex labeling.\nOne gets a Hopf algebra\nstructure on pairs (\u0393, \u03c3) by using the renormalization coproduct \u2206(\u0393) = \u0393\u2032 \u2297 \u0393\u2032\u2032\nP\nby setting \u2206(\u0393, \u03c3) = \u03c4 \u2208{\u03c3}res(\u0393\u2032 ) (\u0393\u2032 , \u03c4 ) \u2297 (\u0393\u2032\u2032\u03c4 , \u03c3). We regard the decomposition into external leg structures\nas a partition of unity and write\nX\n(\u0393, \u03c4 ) = (\u0393, I).\n(2.37)\n\u03c4 \u2208{\u03c3}res(\u0393)\n\nIn our applications we only need this for (sub)graphs \u03b3 with |res(\u03b3)| = 2, and the use of these notions will\nbecome clear in the applications below.\n3. Combinatorics of blow-ups\nn\u22121\n\nWe consider P\nwith fixed homogeneous coordinates A := {A1 , . . . , An }. Suppose given a subset\nS \u2282 2A .

For \u03bc \u2208 S we write L\u03bc \u2282 Pn\u22121 for the coordinate linear space defined by Ai = 0, i \u2208 \u03bc. Write\nL(S) := {L\u03bc | \u03bc \u2208 S}.

(i) Elements in L(S)1 are all disjoint, so we may define P (S)1 to be the variety defined by\nblowing up elements in L(S)1 on Pn\u22121 . We do not need to specify an order in which to perform the blowups.\n(ii) More generally, the strict transforms of elements in L(S)i+1 to the space P (S)i obtained by successively\nblowing the strict transform of L(S)j , j = 1, . . . , i are disjoint, so we may inductively define P (S) to be the\nsuccessive blowup of the L(S)i .\n14\n\n\f(iii) Let Ei \u2282 P (S) correspond to the blowup of L\u03bci , i = 1, . . . , r. (Ei is the unique exceptional divisor\nwith image L\u03bci in P (S).)Then E1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Er 6= \u2205 if and only if after possibly reordering, we have inclusions\nL\u03bc1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 L\u03bcr .\n(iv) The total exceptional divisor E \u2282 P (S) is a normal crossings divisor.\n(v) Let M \u2282 Pn\u22121 be a coordinate linear space. Assume M 6\u2282 L for any L \u2208 L(S). Then M \u2229 L(S) :=\n{M \u2229 L | L \u2208 L(S)} satisfies (3.1). The strict transform of M in P (S) is obtained by blowing up elements\nof M \u2229 L(S) on M as in (i) and (ii) above.\nProof. If L1 6= L2 \u2208 L(S)i and L1 \u2229 L2 6= \u2205, then L1 \u2229 L2 \u2208 L(S)j for some j < i. This means that when we\nget to the i-th step,\nT L1 \u2229L2 has already been blown up, so the strict transforms of the Li are disjoint, proving\n(ii). For (iii), Ei 6= \u2205 \u21d0 L\u03bc1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 L\u03bcr follows from the above argument. Conversely, if we have strict\ninclusions among the L\u03bci , we may write (abusively) L\u03bci /L\u03bci\u22121 for the projective space with homogeneous\ncoordinates the homogeneous coordinates on L\u03bci vanishing on L\u03bci\u22121 .

Recall in 2.1 we defined the notion of core\ngraph.\nProposition 3.2. Let \u0393 be a graph, and let \u03931 , \u03932 \u2282 \u0393 be core subgraphs. Then the union \u03931 \u222a \u03932 is a core\nsubgraph.\nProof. Removing an edge increases the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 characteristic by 1. If h1 doesn't drop, then either\nh0 increases (the graph disconnects when e is removed) or e has a unary vertex so removing e drops the\nnumber of vertices. Suppose e is an edge of \u03931 (assumed core). Then e cannot have a unary vertex. If, on\nthe other hand, removing e disconnects \u03931 \u222a \u03932 , then since the \u0393i are core what must happen is that each\n\u0393i has precisely one vertex of e. But this would imply that \u03931 is not core, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nTo a graph \u0393 we may associate the projective space P(\u0393) with homogeneous coordinates Ae , e \u2208 E(\u0393)\nlabeled by the edges of \u0393. Let \u0393 be a core graph. A coordinate linear space L \u2282 P(\u0393) is a non-empty linear\nspace defined by some subset of the homogeneous coordinate functions, L : Ae1 = * * * = Aep = 0. Define\nL(\u0393) to be the set of coordinate linear spaces in P(\u0393) such that the corresponding set of edges ei1 , . . . , eip is\nthe edge set of a core subgraph \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393. It follows from proposition 3.2 that L(\u0393) satisfies condition (3.1), so\nthe iterated blowup\n\u03c0 : P (\u0393) \u2192 P(\u0393)\n\n(3.3)\n\nas in proposition 3.1 is defined.

Canonically, we may write T (\u0393) = ( e\u2208Edge(\u0393) Gm ) Gm .\nMore important for us:\nProposition 3.4. (i) P (\u0393) is a toric variety for T = T (\u0393).\n(ii) The orbits of T on P (\u0393) are in 1 \u2212 1 correspondence with pairs (F, \u0393p ( * * * ( \u03931 ( \u0393). Here F \u2282 \u0393 is\na (possibly empty) subforest (subgraph with h1 (F ) = 0) and the \u0393i are core subgraphs of \u0393. We require that\nthe image of Fi := F \u2229 \u0393i in \u0393i //\u0393i+1 be a subforest for each i. (cf. (3.2)). The orbit associated to such\na pair is canonically identified with the open orbit in the toric variety P(\u0393p //Fp ) \u00d7 P((\u0393p\u22121 //\u0393p )//Fp\u22121 ) \u00d7\n* * * \u00d7 P((\u0393//\u03931 )//F ).\nProof. A general reference for toric varieties is [9]. The fact (i) that P (\u0393) is a toric variety follows inductively\nfrom the fact that the blowup of an invariant ideal I in a toric variety is toric. Indeed, the torus acts on I\nand hence on the blowup Proj(I).\nWe recall some toric constructions. Let N = ZEdge(\u0393) /Z, and let M = hom(N, Z). We have canonically\nT = Spec Q[M ] where Q[M ] is the group ring of the lattice M . A fan (op. cit., 1.4, p. 20) F is a finite set\nof convex cones in NR = N \u2297 R satisfying certain simple axioms. To a cone C \u2282 NR one associates the dual\ncone (op. cit. p. 4)\n(3.8)\n\nC \u2228 = {m \u2208 MR | hm, ci \u2265 0, \u2200c \u2208 C}\n\n(resp. the semigroup CZ\u2228 = C \u2228 \u2229 M ). The toric variety V (F ) associated to the fan F is then a union of\nthe affine sets U (C) := Spec Q[CZ\u2228 ]. For example,\nour N has rank n \u2212 1. There are n evident elements e\nP\ndetermined by the n edges of \u0393. Let Ce = { e\u2032 6=e re\u2032 e\u2032 | re\u2032 \u2265 0} be the cone spanned by all edges except\ne. The spanning edges for Ce form a basis for N which implies that U (Ce ) \u223c\n= An\u22121 . Since all the coordinate\nrings lie in Q[M ] (i.e. T (\u0393) \u2282 U (Ce )), one is able to glue together the U (Ce ). The resulting toric variety\nassociated to the fan {Ce | e \u2208 Edge(E)} is canonically identified with P(\u0393).\nRemark 3.5. Our toric varieties will all be smooth (closures of orbits in smooth toric varieties are smooth),\nwhich is equivalent ([9], \u00a72) to the condition that cones in the fan are all generated by subsets of bases for\nthe lattice N . Faces of these cones are in 1 \u2212 1 correspondence with subsets of the generating set.\nIn general, the orbits of the torus action are in 1 \u2212 1 correspondence with the cones C in the fan (op. cit.\n3.1, p.51). The subgroup of N generated by C \u2229 N corresponds to the subgroup of T which acts trivially\non the orbit. For example, in the case of projective space Pn\u22121 , there are n cones Ce of dimension n \u2212 1\ncorresponding to the n fixed points (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) \u2208 Pn\u22121 . For any S ( Edge(\u0393), the cone C(S) spanned by\nthe edges of S corresponds to the orbit {(. . . , xe , . . .) | xe = 0 \u21d4 e \u2208 S} \u2282 Pn\u22121 . Let L : Ae = 0, e \u2208 \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393\nbe a coordinate linear space in P(\u0393) associated to a subgraph \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393. It follows from lemma 3.3 that the\nexceptional divisor EL \u2282 PL in the blowup of L can be identified with\n(3.9)\n\nEL = P(\u0393\u2032 ) \u00d7 P(\u0393//\u0393\u2032 ).\n\nP\n\u2032\n\u22650\nLet e(\u0393\u2032 ) =\n* e(\u0393\u2032 ). The subgroup Z * e(\u0393\u2032 ) \u2282 N determines a\ne\u2208\u0393\u2032 e \u2282 NR , and write \u03c4 (\u0393 ) = R\n\u2032\n1-parameter subgroup G(\u0393 ) \u2282 T = Spec Q[M ]. It follows from (3.9) that G(\u0393\u2032 ) acts trivially on EL . One\nhas \u03c4 (\u0393\u2032 ) \u2282 C \u2032 \u2282 Ce for all e 6\u2208 \u0393\u2032 , where C \u2032 is the cone generated by the edges of \u0393\u2032 . For all e\u2032 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 we\n16\n\n\fdefine a subcone Ce,e\u2032 \u2282 Ce to be spanned by \u03c4 (\u0393\u2032 ) together with all edges of \u0393 except e, e\u2032 . The fan for PL\nis then\n(3.10)\n\n{Ce , e \u2208 \u0393\u2032 } \u222a { Ce,e\u2032 , e 6\u2208 \u0393\u2032 , e\u2032 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 }.\n\nNote that Ce , e 6\u2208 \u0393\u2032 is not a cone in the fan for PL . More generally, let F be the fan for P (\u0393). Certainly,\nF will contain as cones the half-lines \u03c4 (\u0393\u2032 ) for all core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393 as well as the R\u22650 e, e \u2208 \u0393. but\nwe must make precise which subsets of this set of half-lines span higher dimensional cones in F . By general\ntheory, the cones correspond to the nonempty orbits. In other words,\n(3.11)\n\nR\u22650 e1 , . . . , R\u22650 ep , R\u22650 e(\u03931 ), . . . , R\u22650 e(\u0393q )\n\nspan a cone in F if and only if the intersection\n(3.12)\n\nE1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Eq \u2229 D1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Dp 6= \u2205,\n\nwhere Ei \u2282 P (\u0393) is the exceptional divisor corresponding to L(\u0393i ) and Dj \u2282 P (\u0393) is the strict transform of\nthe coordinate divisor Aei = 0 in P(\u0393). To understand (3.12), consider the simple case E1 \u2229 D1 . We have a\ncore subgraph \u03931 \u2282 \u0393, and an edge e1 of \u0393. We know by lemma 3.3 that E1 \u223c\n= P(\u03931 ) \u00d7 P(\u0393//\u03931 ). If e1 is an\nedge of \u03931 , then D1 \u2229 E1 = P(\u03931 //e1 ) \u00d7 P(\u0393//\u03931 ). Otherwise\nD1 \u2229 E1 = P(\u03931 ) \u00d7 P((\u0393//\u03931 )//e1 ).\nOne (degenerate) possibility is that e1 is an edge of \u03931 which forms a loop (tadpole). In this case, e1 is itself\na core subgraph of \u0393, and the divisor D1 should be treated as one of the exceptional divisors Ei . Thus, we\nomit this possibility. Another possibility is that e1 6\u2208 \u03931 , but that the image of e1 in \u0393//\u03931 forms a loop.\nIn this case, \u03932 := \u03931 \u222a e1 is a core subgraph, so the linear space L2 : Ae = 0, e \u2208 \u03932 gets blown up in\nthe process of constructing P (\u0393). But blowing L2 separates E1 and D1 , so the intersection of the strict\ntransforms of D1 and E1 in P (\u0393) is empty. The general argument to show that (3.12) is empty if and only\nif the conditions of (ii) in the proposition are fulfilled is similar and is left for the reader. Note that the case\nwhere there are no divisors Di follows from proposition 3.1(iii).\n\u0003\nWe are particularly interested in orbits corresponding to filtrations by core subgraphs \u0393p ( * * * ( \u03931 ( \u0393.\nLet V \u2282 P (\u0393) be the closure of this orbit. We want to exhibit a toric neighborhood of P\nV which retracts onto\nV as a vector bundle of rank p. As in the proof of proposition 3.4 we have e(\u0393i ) := e\u2208\u0393i e. The cone C\nspanned by the e(\u0393i ) lies in the fan F . For cones C \u2032 \u2208 F we write C \u2032 > C if C is a subcone of C \u2032 . By the\ngeneral theory, this will happen if and only if C \u2282 C \u2032 is a subcone which appears on the boundary of C \u2032 .\nThe orbit corresponding to C \u2032 will then appear in the closure of the orbit for C.\nProposition 3.6. With notation as above, Let FC \u2282 F be the subset of cones C \u2032 such that we have\nC \u2032 \u2264 C \u2032\u2032 \u2265 C for some C \u2032\u2032 \u2208 F . Write P 0 \u2282 P (\u0393) for the open toric subvariety corresponding to the subfan\nFC \u2282 F . We have V \u0592\u2192 P 0 \u2282 P (\u0393). Further there is a retraction \u03c0 : P 0 \u2192 V realizing P 0 as a rank p\nvector bundle over V which is equivariant for the action of the torus T .\nProof. One has the following functoriality for toric varieties [9], \u00a71.4. Suppose \u03c6 : N \u2032 \u2192 N \u2032\u2032 is a homomorphism of lattices (finitely generated free abelian groups). Let F \u2032 , F \u2032\u2032 be fans in NR\u2032 , NR\u2032\u2032 . Suppose for each\ncone \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 F \u2032 there exists a cone \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 F \u2032\u2032 such that \u03c6(\u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2282 \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 . Then there is an induced map on toric\nvarieties V (F \u2032 ) \u2192 V (F \u2032\u2032 ). Let N \u2032 = N = Zn /Z as above, and N \u2032\u2032 = N \u2032 /(Ze(\u03931 ) + * * * + Ze(\u0393p )). One has\nthe evident surjection \u03c6 : N \u2032 \u0589 N \u2032\u2032 . We take as fan F \u2032 = FC \u2282 F . The closure V of the orbit corresponds\nto the fan F \u2032\u2032 in NR\u2032\u2032 given by the images of all cones C \u2032\u2032 \u2265 C (op. cit. \u00a73.1). Such a C \u2032\u2032 is generated by\ne(\u03931 ), . . . , e(\u0393p ), f1 , . . . , fq , and there are no linear relations among these elements (remark 3.5). A subcone\nC \u2032 \u2264 C \u2032\u2032 is generated by a subset e(\u0393i1 ), . . . , e(\u0393ia ), f1 , . . . , fb . The image is simply the cone in NR\u2032\u2032 generated\nby the images of the f 's. If we have another cone C1\u2032 \u2264 C1\u2032\u2032 \u2265 C in F \u2032 with the same image in F \u2032\u2032 , it will\nhave generators say g1 , . . . , gb together with some of the e(\u0393i )'s. Reordering the g's, we find that there are\nrelations\nX\nX\n(3.13)\nfi +\naij e(\u0393j ) = gi +\nbij e(\u0393j )\n\nwith aij , bij \u2265 0. It follows that the cones in F spanned by fi , e(\u03931 ), . . . , e(\u0393p ) and gi , e(\u03931 ), . . . , e(\u0393p ) meet\nin a subset strictly larger that the cone spanned by the e(\u0393j ). By the fan axioms, the intersection of two\ncones in a fan is a common face of both, so these two cones coincide, which implies fi = gi . In particular,\n17\n\n\ffor each cone in F \u2032\u2032 , there is a unique minimal cone in F \u2032 lying over it. This is the hypothesis for [19], p. 58,\nproposition 1.33. One concludes that the map \u03c0 : P 0 \u2192 V induced by the map F \u2032 \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 is an equivariant\nfibration, with fibre the toric bundle associated to the fan generated by the e(\u0393i ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p. This toric\nvariety is just affine p-space, so we get an equivariant Ap -fibration over V . Any such fibration is necessarily\na vector bundle with structure group Gpm . Indeed, this amounts to saying that any automorphism of the\npolynomial ring k[x1 , . . . , xp ] which intertwines the diagonal action of Gpm is necessarily of the form xi 7\u2192 ci xi\nwith ci \u2208 k \u00d7 .\n\u0003\nRemark 3.7. We will need to understand how these constructions are compatible. Let V be a closed orbit\ncorresponding to a cone C as above, and let V1 \u2282 V be a smaller closed orbit corresponding to a larger cone\nC1 > C. (The correspondence between cones and orbits is inclusion-reversing.) As above we have a toric\nvariety V1 \u2282 P10 \u2282 P (\u0393) and a retraction \u03c01 : P10 \u2192 V1 . The fan F1\u2032 for P10 is given by the set of cones C1\u2032 in\nF such that\nC1\u2032 \u2264 C \u2032\u2032 \u2265 C1 (> C).\n\n(3.14)\n\nIt follows that F1\u2032 \u2282 F \u2032 = FC , so P10 \u2282 P 0 is an open subvariety. Let V 0 \u2282 V be the image of the composition\n\u03c0\nP10 \u2282 P 0 \u2212\n\u2192 V . Then V 0 is the open toric subvariety of V corresponding as above to the closed orbit V1 \u2282 V ,\n\u03c0V\nV1 .

Topological Chains on Toric Varieties\nOne can define the notion of non-negative real points V (R\u22650 ) and positive real points V (R>0 ). For a\ntorus T = Spec Q[N \u2228 ] for some N \u223c\n= Zg we take\nT (R>0 ) = {\u03c6 : Q[N \u2228 ] \u2192 R | \u03c6(n) > 0, \u2200n \u2208 N \u2228 }.\n`\nA toric variety V can be stratified as a disjoint union of tori V = T\u03b1 .

P (\u0393) and the real chain \u03c3P\u03b7,\u03b5(\u0393) .\n\nproposition 3.6. We write PV = L1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lp as a direct sum of line bundles, where each Li is equivariant\nfor T (V ). Let K(V ) \u223c\n= (S 1 )p \u2282 T (V )(C) be the maximal compact subgroup. Note that one has a canonical\nidentification T (V ) = Gpm associated to the 1-parameter subgroups of T (V ) generated by e(\u0393i ) \u2208 N . In\nparticular, the identification K(V ) = (S 1 )p is canonical as well. For all closed orbits V we may fix metrics\non the Li which are compatible under inclusions (3.16) and are (necessarily) invariant under the action of\nK(V ). We fix also a constant \u03b7 > 0. We can then define SV\u03b7 \u2282 PV to be the product of the circle bundles\nof radius \u03b7 embedded in the Li . SV\u03b7 becomes a principal bundle over V with structure group K(V ). Note\nthat SV\u03b7 \u2229 PV (R\u22650 ) contains a unique point in every fibre of SV\u03b7 over a point of V (R). Let 0 < \u03b5 << \u03b7 be\nanother constant. We need to define a chain \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 \u2282 V (R>0 ). We consider closures V1 \u2282 V of codimension\n1 orbits in V . For each such V1 we have an open P (V )1 \u2282 V and a retraction P (V )1 \u2192 V1 which is a line\nbundle with a metric. The fibres of P (V )1 (R>0 ) have a canonical coordinate r > 0. If V1 corresponds to an\nintersection of V = E1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Ep with another exceptional divisor Ep+1 , then we remove from each fibre of\nP (V )1 (R>0 ) over V1 (R>0 ) the locus where r < \u03b7. If, on the other hand V1 corresponds to an intersection\nof V with one of the Di (i.e. with a strict transform of one of the coordinate divisors), then we remove the\nlocus r < \u03b5. Repeating this process for each V1 (i.e. for each irreducible toric divisor in V ), we obtain a\ncompact \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 \u2282 V (R>0 ) which stays away from the boundary components. (Here \"boundary components\"\nare exceptional divisors together with strict transforms of coordinate divisors.)\nExample 4.1. Consider the case V = P (\u0393). Let \u03c0 : P (\u0393) \u2192 P(\u0393), and let\n\u03c3 = {(A1 , . . . , An ) | Ai \u2265 0} \u2282 P(\u0393)(R)\nbe the original integration chain. We have \u03c3P\u03b7,\u03b5(\u0393) \u2282 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c3) defined by excising away points within a distance\nof \u03b7 from an Ei or \u03b5 from the strict transform Dj of a coordinate divisor Aj = 0. (cf. fig.(8)). It is a manifold\nwith corners.\nDefine \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5 to be the inverse image of \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 in SV\u03b7 . The fibres of \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5 over \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 are products (S 1 )p with a\ncanonical origin at the point where this fibre meets PV (R\u22650 ). For an angle 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0, we can thus define\n\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 \u2282 \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5 to be swept out by the origin in each fibre under the action of [0, \u03b8]p \u2282 K(V ). The chains \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8\nhave R-dimension n \u2212 1 which is equal to the complex dimension of P(\u0393) and P (\u0393).\n19\n\n\fe2\n\ne1 + e2\n\nC2\n\ne1\n\nfig.\n\nFigure 9. Fan for Example 4.2.\nExample 4.2. Here is an example which is too simple to correspond to any graph, but is sufficient to clarify\nthe toric picture. Take\n(4.2)\n\nL1 : A1 = A2 = 0;\n\nL2 : A2 = 0\n\n\u03c0\n\nin P2 with coordinates A1 , A2 , A3 . Take P \u2212\n\u2192 P2 to be the blowup of L1 = (0, 0, 1). Let E1 \u2282 P be the\nexceptional divisor, and let E2 \u2282 P be the strict transform of L2 . Note that E2 is already a divisor so it is\nnot necessary to blow up again. Take V = E1 \u223c\n= P1 . The fan F for P is fig.(9). The cone C = R\u22650 * (e1 + e2 ),\n\u2032\nso the fan F = FC \u2282 F is the subset of cones lying in the first quadrant. The toric variety PV is A2\nwith (0, 0) blown up. It projects down onto V as a line bundle. SV\u03b7 \u2282 PV (C) is then a circle bundle over\nV (C). V has two suborbits V2 = E1 \u2229 E2 and V1 = E1 \u2229 D1 , where D1 is the strict transform of the divisor\nA1 = 0 in P2 . We may interpret z := A1 /A2 as a coordinate on V , so V1 : z = 0 and V2 : z = \u221e. We have\nP (V )1 = V \u2212 {z = \u221e} and P (V )2 = V \u2212 {z = 0}. The real chain \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 = {\u03b7 \u2264 z \u2264 1/\u03b5}, and \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5 is the\nS 1 -bundle of radius \u03b7 over \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5 . On the other hand, V2 corresponds to the cone labeled C2 in fig.(9), and\nthe fan FC2 is just C2 itself. The toric variety PV2 \u223c\n= A2 is a rank 2 vector bundle over the point V2 . We\n\u223c\nhave PV2 \u2282 PV . In this case \u03c3V\u03b7,\u03b5\nis\nsimply\nthe\npoint\nV2 , and \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5\n= S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2282 PV1 (C). In local coordinates\n2\n2\naround V1 given by eigenfunctions for the torus action we have\n(4.3)\n\n\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 = {(\u03b7ei\u03bc , z) | \u03b7 \u2264 z \u2264 1/\u03b5, 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03b8}\n\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8\n= {(\u03b7ei\u03bc , \u03b7ei\u03bd ) | 0 \u2264 \u03bc, \u03bd \u2264 \u03b8}\n1\n= {(\u03b7ei\u03bc , \u03b7) | 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03b8}.\n\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 \u2229 \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8\n1\n\nWe want now to establish a basic formula for the boundary of the chains \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 . Here V runs through the\nclosures of orbits in P (\u0393) associated to flags of core subgraphs (3.17). We include the big orbit V = P (\u0393).\nWe write |V | := codim(V /P (\u0393)). We may express the boundary chains \u2202\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 locally (in fact Zariski-locally)\nin coordinates which are eigenfunctions for the torus action. It is clear (cf. (4.3)) that boundary terms are\nobtained by setting a suitable one of these coordinates to be constant: either \u03b7ei\u03b8 or \u03b7 or \u03b5. (The presence\nof 1/\u03b5 in the first line of (4.3) simply means that the appropriate coordinate near that point is 1/z.)\nProposition 4.3.

The monodromy chain, with angular variable \u03b8.\nwill contain no chains with one coordinate constant = \u03b7.\nProof. (Cf. fig.(10) ). For a given boundary term, we can choose local eigenfunction coordinates x1 , . . . , xn\u22121\nsuch that be boundary term is given by x1 = \u03b7. We take the chains to be oriented in some consistant way\nby this ordering of coordinates. (Note that these coordinates are defined on a Zariski open set. The\nobstruction to choosing consistent orientations for various open sets is a class in the first Zariski cohomology\nof P (\u0393) with constant Z/2Z-coefficients. Since this cohomology group vanishes, we can choose such consistent\norientations.) If \u2202\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 contains a term with x1 = \u03b7, there are two possibilities. Either x1 is a real coordinate\non \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 or it is a circular coordinate. If x1 is a real coordinate, then the fact that x1 = \u03b7 appears in the\nboundary means that locally x1 = 0 defines a codimension 1 orbit closure V1 \u0592\u2192 V . In \u2202\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8\n, x1 will\n1\nappear as a circular coordinate. Since |V | = |V1 | + 1, the same chain x1 = \u03b7 will appear in \u2202\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 and in\nand will cancel in (4.4). If, on the other hand, x1 = \u03b7ei\u03b8 is a circular coordinate, then for suitable\n\u2202\u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8\n1\nordering of coordinates, the chain will be an (S 1 )p -bundle over a chain \u03c3 contained in the locus where certain\ncoordinates \u2265 0. But then (4.4) will contain another chain which is an (S 1 )p\u22121 -bundle over {x1 \u2265 \u03b7} \u00d7 \u03c3,\nand the boundary components involving x1 = \u03b7 will occur with opposite signs and will cancel.\n\u0003\nThe boundary chain (4.4) is an (n \u2212 2)-chain involving two scales 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b7. We want to construct an\n(n \u2212 1)-chain\n\u03be \u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 which amounts to a scaling \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b5. To do this, we construct a vector field v on P (\u0393). Let\nP\nE=\nEi be the exceptional divisor. v will be 0 outside a neighborhood N of E. Locally, at a point on N\nwhich is close to divisors E1 , . . . , Ep we have coordinates x1 , . . . , xp which are eigenfunctions for the torus\naction such that locally Ei : xi = 0. Locally we will take v to be radial and inward-pointing in each xi . We\nglue these local v's using a partition of unity. \"Flowing\" the (n \u2212 2)-chain (4.4) along this vector field yields\nan (n \u2212 1)-chain \u03be \u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 .

These assertions are straightforward from the results in [2], section 3. Note that (iv) justifies our\nstrategy of only blowing up core subgraphs.\n\u0003\nWe have seen (remark 3.4) that our blowup P (\u0393) is stratified as a union of tori indexed by pairs\n(5.2)\n\n(F, {\u0393p ( * * * ( \u03931 ( \u0393//\u03b3})\n\nwhere F \u2282 \u0393 is a suitable subforest and the \u0393i are core.\nProposition 5.2.

Let EL \u2282 PL be the exceptional divisor, and let YL \u2282 PL be the strict\ntransform of X\u0393 .

Since \u03c0 : P (\u0393) \u2212 E \u2212 Y\u0393 \u223c\n= P(\u0393) \u2212 X\u0393 , we have an\nisomorphism of topological pairs\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n(6.3)\nP (\u0393) \u2212 E \u2212 Y\u0393 , \u2206\u2032\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2212 \u2206\u2032\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2229 (E \u222a Y\u0393 ) \u223c\n= P(\u0393) \u2212 X\u0393 , \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2212 \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2229 X\u0393 .\n\nIn section 4 we have defined chains \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 , \u03be \u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 , c\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 on P (\u0393). These chains sit on (or, in the case of \u03be,\nwithin) various (S 1 )p -bundles over P (\u0393)(R\u22650 ) where the S 1 have radius \u03b7 with respect to a chosen metric.\nFrom corollary 5.3 it follows that for 0 < \u03b7 << 1, none of these chains meets Y\u0393 . By construction, these\nchains do not meet E, so they may be identified with chains on P(\u0393)\u2212X\u0393 . We claim that a small modification\nof the chains c\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 will represent the monodromy chains \u03c3\u03b5ei\u03b8 . The monodromy chains \u03c3\u03b5ei\u03b8 should have\nboundary on \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 . On the other hand, the chains c\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 were cut off so they had boundaries on tubes a\ndistance \u03b5 from the toric divisors Dj given by the strict transforms of the Aj = 0 (see fig.(12)). We must\n\"massage\" these brutal cutoffs to get them into \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 . Our chains \u03c4 sit on tubes or products of tubes or\nproducts of tubes of radius \u03b7 which we can think of as lying on Pn\u22121 \u2212 L. Since \u03b5 << \u03b7, when we deform\n\u2206 \u2192 \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 the homotopy type of the circles, or product of circles where these divisors intersect the tubes\ndoesn't change. This may seem strange because L \u2282 \u2206 while \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 is in general position with respect to\nL, but the intersections with a hollow tubular neighborhood of L are canonically homotopic. Indeed, we\nmay take \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 to correspond to a point in a small contractible disk in the moduli space for coordinate\nsimplices around the point corresponding to \u2206. The canonical path up to homotopy between the two points\nin moduli will induce the desired homotopy on the intersections. (See fig.(13). The two sets of four dots on\nthe circles are canonically homotopic.). In more detail, by corollary 5.3, the chains \u03c4 \u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 are bounded away\nfrom X\u0393 by a bound which is independent of \u03b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0. Outside of some tubular neighborhood N of X\u0393\nwe may find a space M disjoint from X\u0393 such that M contains open neighborhoods of both \u2206 \u2212 N \u2229 \u2206 and\n\u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2212N \u2229\u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 and such that we have deformation retractions M \u2192 \u2206\u2212N \u2229\u2206 and M \u2192 \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 \u2212N \u2229\u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 .\n24\n\n\fL\n\nL\n\nfig.8\nD\u0395ei\u0398\n\nD\n\nFigure 13. Homotopy invariance of \u2206t \u2229 tube over L.\nShrinking \u03b5, we may assume our \u03b5-cutoffs lie in M . We may then use the deformation retract to extend\nthe chain slightly to a chain \u03c4\u0303V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 which bounds on \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 . It remains to consider the chains \u03be \u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 . Recall\nP\nthese were obtained by flowing the chain \u2202 V (\u22121)|V | \u03c4V\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 inward toward the exceptional divisor E, so\n\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b5 (cf. fig.(10)). We are in a small neighborhood of E(R\u22650 ) hence by corollary 5.3 we are away from\nP\nX\u0393 . The point to be checked is that the term \u2202 V (\u22121)|V | \u03c4V\u03b5,\u03b5,\u03b8 is very close to \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 so by the same\ndeformation retraction argument as above we can extend the chain to bound on \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 . The subtlety is that\nwe are \u03b5-close to E as well, so we need the distance from \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 to be o(\u03b5). Recall (6.1) we have the vertices\nrk (\u03b5ei\u03b8 ) = [qk1 \u03b5ei\u03b8 , . . . , 1 + qkk \u03b5ei\u03b8 , . . . , qkn \u03b5ei\u03b8 ] \u2208 Pn\u22121 . The coordinate divisor \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 is determined by these\ni\u03b8\nprojective points. The projective point does not change if we scale\nPthe coordinates by e , so the image in\nn\u22121\nP\nof the affine simplex below, parametrized by \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4n \u2265 0,\n\u03c4j = 1, will have boundary in \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 :\n(6.4) ei\u03b8 \u03c41 (1 + \u03b5ei\u03b8 q11 , . . . , \u03b5ei\u03b8 q1n ) + * * *\n\n+ ei\u03b8 \u03c4p (\u03b5ei\u03b8 qp1 , . . . , 1 + \u03b5ei\u03b8 qpp , . . . , \u03b5ei\u03b8 qpn )\n+ \u03c4p+1 (\u03b5ei\u03b8 qp+1,1 , . . . , 1 + \u03b5ei\u03b8 qp+1,p+1 , . . . , \u03b5ei\u03b8 qp+1,n ) + * * *\n+ \u03c4n (\u03b5ei\u03b8 qn1 , . . . , \u03b5ei\u03b8 qnn + 1).\nConsider for example \u2202\u03c4V\u03b5,\u03b5,\u03b8 where V is the orbit closure corresponding to the blowup of A1 = * * * = Ap = 0.\nTake in (6.4) \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4p \u2264 \u03b5 so terms in \u03c4j \u03b5 may be neglected for j \u2264 p. Take uj := \u03c4j /\u03c4k where k > p is\nchosen so that (say) \u03c4k \u2265 1/n. As a consequence, u1 , . . . , up \u2264 n\u03b5. The corresponding projective point can\nthen be written\nh\n(6.5) ei\u03b8 (u1 + \u03b5) + O(\u03b52 ), . . . , ei\u03b8 (up + \u03b5) + O(\u03b52 ),\ni\nup+1 + ei\u03b8 \u03b5 + O(\u03b52 ), . . . , un + ei\u03b8 \u03b5 + O(\u03b52 ) .\n\nThe boundary is given by setting one or more of the uj = 0. Points in \u2202\u03c4V\u03b5,\u03b5,\u03b8 can be approximated by points\n(6.5) which then deform into \u2206\u03b5ei\u03b8 . To see this, note that since V is a codimension 1 orbit closure, there\nwill locally be one coordinate on P (\u0393) near V which takes the constant value \u03b5ei\u03b8 on \u2202\u03c4V\u03b5,\u03b5,\u03b8 (cf. fig.(10)).\nOn the other hand, (6.5) is in homogeneous coordinates on P(\u0393). To transform to P (\u0393) near a general point\nof V , one fixes l \u2264 p and looks at ratios\n(6.6)\n\nei\u03b8 (uj + \u03b5) + O(\u03b52 )\nei\u03b8 (ul + \u03b5) + O(\u03b52 )\n\nfor 1 \u2264 j 6= l \u2264 p. Clearly, at the boundary ul = 0 we will get p \u2212 1 coordinates uj /\u03b5 + O(\u03b5) which are close\nto R\u22650 , and one coordinate (corresponding to the local defining equation for V ) of the form \u03b5ei\u03b8 + O(\u03b52 ).\nThe remaining coordinates on V are ratios of the uj + \u03b5ei\u03b8 + O(\u03b52 ), j \u2265 p + 1. Since uk = 1, these ratios\nare again close to R\u22650 . The calculation for orbit closures V of codimension \u2265 2 in P (\u0393) is similar and is left\nfor the reader.

Also, Q(Ti ) is the sum of all\nexternal momenta attached to vertices covered by Ti . Note that \u03c6(\u0393) can be written as\nX\nRqi *qj .\n(7.3)\nkinetic invariants (qi * qj )\n\nHere, qi are external momenta attached to T1 and qj to T2 , and Rqi *qj are rational functions of the edge\nvariables only, and the sum is over independent such kinematical invariants where momentum conservation\nhas been taken into account.

If that edge belongs to \u0393//\u03b3, we get \u03c6(\u0393//\u03b3)\u03c8(\u03b3).\nIf it belongs to \u03b3, we get a monomial m with |m|\u03b3 > |\u03c8(\u03b3)|\u03b3 .\n\u0003\nNote that it might happen that \u03c6(\u0393//\u03b3) = 0, if the external momenta flows through subgraphs \u03b3 only. In\nsuch a case (which can lead to infrared divergences) one easily shows \u03c6\u0393,\u03b3 = \u03c8(\u0393//\u03b3)\u03c6(\u03b3).\n26\n\n\f7.2.

We often omit the A dependence and abbreviate P = {m}, {qi * qj } for all these\nexternal parameters of the integrand: \u03b9 = \u03b9(P ). The renormalization schemes we consider are determined\nby the condition that the Green function shall vanish at a particular renormalization point R, so that\nrenormalization becomes an iterated sequence of subtractions\n\u03b9\u2212 (P, R) := \u03b9(P ) \u2212 \u03b9(R).\n\n(7.8)\n\nWe let sdd(\u0393) be the superficial degree of divergence of a graph \u0393 given as (see also Eq.(2.2) for a refined\nversion)\nX\nX\n(7.9)\nsdd(\u0393) := D|\u0393| \u2212\nwe \u2212\nwv ,\nedges e\n\nvertices v\n\nwhere |\u0393| is the rank of the first Betti homology, D the dimension of spacetime which we keep as an integer,\nwe the weights of the propagator for edge e as prescribed by free field theory and wv the weight\nof theR vertex\nR\nas prescribed by the interaction Lagrangian. Note that we can set the width \u01eb to zero, >\u01eb dA\u0393 \u2192 >0 dA\u0393\nif the integrand \u03b9\u2212 (\u0393) is evaluated on a graph \u0393 which has no divergent subgraphs.\nThroughout, we assume that all all masses and external momenta are in general position so that there are\nno zeroes in the \u03c6-polynomial off the origin for positive values of the A variables. In particular, we assume\nthat the point P is chosen appropriately away from all mass-shell and kinematical singularities. We remind\nthe reader of the notation (\u0393, \u03c3) (section (2.5)) where \u03c3 stores all the necessary detail on how to evaluate\nthe graph \u0393.\nA special role is played by the evaluations (\u0393, \u03c3P =0 ). They set all internal masses and momenta to zero.\nNote that this leads immediately to infrared divergences: the Feynman integrands \u03b9(*)(P = 0) are missing\nthe exponential in the numerator, which provides a regulator at large values of the A variables, and hence an\ninfrared regulator. The ultraviolet singularities at small values of the A variables are taken into account by\nthe renormalization procedure itself, and hence by our limiting mixed Hodge structure. We will eliminate the\ncase P = 0 below using that \u03b9\u2212 evaluates to zero if there is no dependence on masses or external momenta.\n7.3. General remarks on renormalization and QFT. We now consider the renormalization Hopf algebra HR of 1PI Feynman graphs in section (2.4).

Here,\na forest [for] is a possibly empty collection of proper superficially divergent 1PI subgraphs \u03b3[for],j of \u0393 which\nare mutually disjoint or nested. We call a forest [for] maximal if \u0393//[for] is a primitive element of the Hopf\nalgebra.

The rational coefficient \u03c9II has log-poles only for all subgraphs including the ones with\nsdd = 2.\nThe terms III is considered in t, ai variables. We can integrate t as before. As the rational part of the\n[1]\nintegrand factorizes in \u0393\u20322 and \u0393\u2032\u2032 variables, we similarly decompose the former into s, bi , i \u2208 \u0393\u20322 , variables.\nWe note s only appears in the log (after the t integration) as a coefficient of \u03c6\u0393,\u0393\u20322 , using Lemma (7.1).\nPartial integration in s eliminates the log and delivers a top-degree form for the bi integration. These terms\nprecisely compensate against the constant terms mentioned above, as \u03c6\u0393,\u0393\u20322 = \u03c61 (\u0393\u20322 )\u03c61 (\u0393 \u2212 \u0393\u20322 ), using that\nres(\u0393\u20322 ) = 2.\nWe hence summarize\nTheorem 7.3.\n(7.58)\n\n\u03a6R (\u0393)(P ) = lim\n\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nX\n\u03b3\n\n\u03a6\nSR;\u01eb\n(\u03b3)\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\n\n\u03c9II (\u0393//\u03b3) ln\n\n\u03c6(\u0393//\u03b3)(P )\n.\n\u03c6(\u0393//\u03b3)(R)\n\nIt is understood that each counterterm is computed with a subtraction R as befits its argument \u03b3, and forms\n\u0393 are chosen in accordance with the previous derivations.

We have worked with choices of renormalizations for mass and wave functions, R \u2192 R\u0003 , Rm2 .\nOne can actually also define P \u2192 P\u0003 , Pm2 , and for example set masses to zero in all exponentials (\u03c6(*)(P ) \u2192\n\u03c6q2 (*)), that's essentially the Weinberg scheme if one then subtracts at q 2 = \u03bc2 .\nRemark 7.6. This all is Rnicely reflected in properties of analytic regulators. For example in dimensional\nregularization the identity dD k[k 2 ]\u03c1 = 0, \u2200\u03c1, leads to \u03a6(\u0393)(P = 0) = 0 immediately, where \u03a6 now indicates\nunrenormalized Feynman rules using that regulator.\nRemark 7.7. We are working so far with constant lower boundaries. The chains introduced in previous\nsections have moving lower boundaries which respect the hierarchy in each flag. We will study that difference\nin section (9.1).\n7.5. Specifics of the MOM-scheme. We define the MOM-scheme by setting all masses to zero in radiative\ncorrections and keeping a single kinematical invariant q 2 in the \u03c6-polynomial, P = {0}, {qi * qj \u223c q 2 },\n(7.60)\n\n\u03c6(\u0393) = q 2 Rq2 (\u0393).\n\nSuch a situation arises if we set masses to zero (possibly after factorization of a polynomial part from the\namplitude as in the Weinberg scheme), and for vertices if we consider the case of zero momentum transfers,\nor evaluate at a symmetric point qi2 = q 2 , where i denotes the external half-edges of \u0393. If we want to\nemphasize the q 2 dependence we write \u03c6q2 . Trivially, \u03c6q2 = q 2 \u03c61 . In the MOM-scheme, subtractions are\ndone at q 2 = \u03bc2 , which defines R for all graphs. Counter-terms in the MOM-scheme become very simple\nwhen expressed in parametric integrals thanks to the homogeneity of the \u03c6-polynomial. Note that we hence\nhave \u03c6(\u0393) = \u03c6(\u0393) as we have set all masses to zero.\nIn a MOM-scheme, renormalized diagrams are polynomials in ln q 2 /\u03bc2 :\nTheorem 7.8.

This is in one-to-one correspondence with some decorated\nrooted tree appearing in \u03c1R (\u0393) (2.35). Choose one edge ej \u2208 \u03b3j /\u03b3j\u22121 in each decoration and de-homogenize\nwith respect to that edge. We get a sequence of lower boundaries \u01eb, \u01eb/A2 , \u01eb/A2 /A3 , * * * . Use the affine representation and integrate to obtain the result.\n\u0003\n7.5.1. MOM scheme results from residues. In such a scheme, it is particularly useful to take a derivative\nwith respect to ln q 2 . We consider\n(7.62)\n\np1 (\u0393) := q 2 \u2202q2 \u03a6MOM (\u0393)(q 2 /\u03bc2 )|q2 =\u03bc2 ,\n\nwhere we evaluate at q 2 = \u03bc2 after taking the derivative. This number, which for a primitive element of\nthe renormalization Hopf algebra is the residue of that graph in the sense of [2], is our main concern for a\ngeneral graph. It will be obtained in the limit of the limiting mixed Hodge structure we construct.\n33\n\n\fRemark 7.9. It is not that this limit would not exist for general schemes. But the limit would be a complicated function of ratios of masses and kinematical invariants, which has a constant term given by the number\np1 (\u0393) and beyond that a dependence on these ratios which demands a much finer Hodge theoretic study than\nwe can offer here.\nBut first we need to remind ourselves how coefficients of higher powers of logarithms of complicated graphs\nrelated to coefficients of lower powers of sub- and co-graphs thanks to the renormalization group.\nPaug(\u0393)\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n7.5.2. The counterterm SMOM\n. For SMOM\n(\u0393) =:\nsj (\u0393) lnj \u03bc2 , we simply use the renormalization\nj=1\ngroup or the scattering type formula. In particular, we have\naug(\u0393)\n\u03a6\nSMOM\n(\u0393) =\n\n(7.63)\n\nX 1\n(\u22121)j [p1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 p1 ] \u2206j\u22121 (\u0393).\n{z\n}\n|\nj!\nj=1\njfactors\n\nThis is easily derived [6, 17] upon noting that p1 (\u0393) = \u03a6(S \u22c6 Y (\u0393)).\nNote that this determines counter-terms by iteration: for a k-loop graph, knowledge of all the lower order\ncounterterms suffices to determine all contributions to the k-loop counterterm but the lowest order coefficient\nof ln \u03bc2 . But then, that coefficient is given by the formula\ns1 (\u0393) = p1 (\u0393) ln \u03bc2 ,\n\n(7.64)\n\nwhich itself only involves counter-terms of less than k loops, by the structure of the bar operation.\n7.5.3. p1 (\u0393) from co-graphs. We can now summarize the consequences of the renormalization group and our\nprojective representations for parametric representations of Feynman integrals.

In that case,\nq 2 \u2202q2 ln \u03c6q2 (\u0393//\u03b3) = 1 and no logs in the numerator appear.\nRemark 7.11. Note that overlapping divergent graphs can force all edges to belong to divergent subgraphs,\ncf. Fig.(5).\nProof: If all edges carrying external momentum are in the complement to divergent subgraphs, we bring the\ncounter-terms under the integrand using the bar-operation. We can take the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 in the integrand for\nall edge variables belonging to subgraphs, and this limit commutes with the derivative with respect to ln q 2\nby assumption: each \u03c62q (\u0393//\u03b3) is a linear combination of terms Ae \u03c8e (\u0393//\u03b3), where e is in that complement\nC(\u0393) of subgraph edges, and \u03c8e (\u0393//\u03b3) = \u03c8(\u0393//\u03b3/e). Applying then the Chen-Wu theorem [21] with respect\nto the elements of C(\u0393) disentangles the q 2 dependence from the limit in \u01eb.\n\u0003\n34\n\n\f2\n3\n4\n1\n\n4\n123\n\n3\n+\n124\n\n12\n+\n4 or 3\n\n34\n\n34 or 12\n\n123 or 124\n\nFigure 14. The Dunce's cap, again. We label the edges 1, 2, 3, 4. Resolved in trees, we\nfind three trees in the core Hopf algebra. We label the vertices by edge labels of the\ngraph. The sets 123 and 124 correspond to a triangle graph as indicated, the sets 12 and\n34 are one-loop vertex graphs, and tadpoles appear in the coproduct on the rhs for edges\n3 or 4. The coproduct in the core Hopf algebra is, expressed in edge labels, \u2206\u2032 (1234) =\n123 \u2297 4 + 124 \u2297 3 + 34 \u2297 12. Only the last term appears in the renormalization Hopf algebra.\n\nRemark 7.12. Note that the discussion below with respect to the limiting Hodge structure assumes that we\nhave this situation of disentanglement of divergent subgraphs and edges carrying external momentum. We\nhence have no logarithms in the numerator. But note that the general case does no harm to the ensuing\ndiscussion: by Lemma (7.1), any logarithms in the numerator are congruent to one along any exceptional\ndivisor of X\u0393//[for] . Furthermore, when external momentum interferes with subgraphs, all logs can be turned\nto rational functions by a partial integration. The fact that the second Kirchhoff\u2013Symanzik polynomial is\na linear combination of \u03c8-polynomials, applied to graphs with an extra shrunken edge, in the MOM-case\nestablishes these rational functions\nR to have poles coming from our analysis of this \u03c8(\u0393) polynomial. A full\nmathematical discussion of this \" \u03c9 ln f \" situation should be subject to future work.\n7.5.4.

Consider the graph on the upper left in Fig.(7), and consider the finite\nln \u03c6/\u03c8-type contributions of the exponential integral to in the vicinity of the exceptional divisor for the\nsubspace A3 = A4 = 0.\nRouting an external momentum through edges 1,6, we have the following graph polynomials:\n(7.83)\n\n\u03c61 (\u0393) =\n\n(7.84)\n(7.85)\n\n\u03c61 (\u0393/34) =\n\u03c61 (34) =\n\n(7.86)\n(7.87)\n\n\u03c8(\u0393/34) =\n\u03c8(34) =\n\nA1 [A3 A4 (A5 + A6 ) + A5 A6 (A3 + A4 ) + A2 (A3 + A4 )(A5 + A6 )]\n+A6 A5 [(A1 + A2 )(A3 + A4 ) + A3 A4 ]\nA1 [A5 A6 + A2 (A5 + A6 )] + A5 A6 [(A1 + A2 )]\nA3 A4\n(A1 + A2 )(A5 + A6 ) + A5 A6\nA3 + A4 .\n\nWe have C(\u0393) = e1 , e6 , and \u222a\u03b3(\u0393,res(\u03b3)\u22650 \u03b3 [1] = e3 , e4 , e5 , e6 . The intersection is e6 .

It has to be: the forest\nwhere the subgraph 56 shrinks to a point looses the momentum flow through edge 6 and could not contribute\nany counterterm for a pole remaining in the terms discussed above.\nNote that in general higher powers of logarithms can appear in the numerator as subgraphs can have\nsubstructure. Lacking a handle to notate all the log-poles which do not cancel due to partial integration\nidentities known beyond mankind we consider it understood that all terms from the asymptotic expansion\nof the exponential integral up to constant terms (higher order terms in \u01eb are not needed as all poles are\nlogarithmic only) are kept without being shown explicitly in further notation. We emphasize though that\n\n(7.90)\n\n37\n\n\fall those logarithm terms in the numerator are congruent to one along log-poles -and deserve study in their\nown right elsewhere-, and hence thanks to Lemma (7.1) which guarantees indeed all necessary cancelations,\nwe have in all cases:\n(7.91)\n\np1 (\u0393) = lim \u2202ln q2 \u03a6\u0304\u01eb (\u0393)q2 =1 .\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nRemark 7.13. There is freedom in the choice of \u03c4 , a natural choice comes from the rooted tree representation\n\u03c1(\u0393) of the forest. Each forest is part of a legal tree t and any subgraph \u03b3 corresponds to a vertex v in that\ntree. If dv is the distance of v to the root of t, \u03c4 (\u01eb) = \u01ebdv +1 is a natural choice.\n8. N\n8.1. for physicists: The antipode as monodromy. Let us now come back to the core Hopf algebra and\nprepare for an analysis in terms of limiting mixed Hodge structures. This will be achieved in two steps: an\nanalysis of the structure of the antipode of the renormalization Hopf algebra, which will then allow to define\na matrix N for the monodromy in question such that S(\u0393) can be expressed in a particularly nice way. In\nfact, because of orientations, the N which arises in the monodromy calculation is the negative of the N\ncomputed in this section. We omit the minus sign to simplify the notation.\nLet us consider the antipode first.

Let us now label the edges of each t(\u0393) once and for all by 1, 2, * * * , |\u0393| \u2212 1.\nThen, we have |\u0393| \u2212 1 cuts C with |C| = 1, and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|\u0393| \u2212 1\n(8.2)\nj\ncuts of cardinality |C| = j.

The matrix N . Let M (0, 1) be the space of matrices with entries in the two point set {0, 1}.\nLet now m + 1 be the number of loops m = |\u0393| \u2212 1 in the graph and let us construct a nilpotent 2m \u00d7 2m\nsquare matrix N \u2261 N (m) , N m+1 = 0, in M (0, 1) as follows.\nConsider first the m + 1-th row of the Pascal triangle, for example for m = 3 it reads 1, 3, 3, 1. For this\nexample, we will then construct blocks of sizes 1 \u00d7 1, 1 \u00d7 3, 3 \u00d7 3, 3 \u00d7 1 and 1 \u00d7 1, all with entries either 0\nor 1.\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\nSo this gives us in general m+2 blocks Mj , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m+1, of matrices of size M0 : 1\u00d71, M1 : 1\u00d7m,\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\nM2 : m \u00d7 m(m \u2212 1)/2!, * * * , Mm : m \u00d7 1, Mm+1 : 1 \u00d7 1.\n(m)\nIn the block Mj , 0 \u2264 j < (m + 2)/2, fill the columns, from left to right, by never increasing sequences\nof binary numbers (read from top to bottom) where each such number contains j entries 1 for the block\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\nMj . Put M0 = (0) in the left upper corner and M1 to the left of it. For j \u2265 2, put the block Mj\n(m)\n\nbelow and to the right of the block Mj\u22121 , in N . All entries in N outside these blocks are zero.

Math:The Matrix N . In this section we compute the matrix N which gives the log of the monodromy.\nBecause of orientations, the answer we get is the negative of the physical N computed in the previous section.\nOur basic result gives the monodromy\nX\nX\n(8.17)\nm(\u03c31 ) =\n(\u22121)p \u03c4I = \u03c31 +\n(\u22121)p \u03c4I .\nI\n\nI, p\u22651\n\nHere we have changed notation. I = {i1 , . . . , ip } refers to a flag \u0393i1 ( * * * ( \u0393ip ( \u0393 of core subgraphs. More\ngenerally\nX\n(8.18)\nm(\u03c4I ) =\n(\u22121)q\u2212p \u03c4J .\nJ\u2283I\n\nHere J = {j1 , . . . , jq } \u2283 I. to verify (8.18), consider e.g. the case corresponding to \u03931 ( \u0393. We have\nseen (lemma 3.3) that the blowup of P(\u0393) along the linear space defined by the edge variables associated to\nedges of \u03931 yields as exceptional divisor E1 \u223c\n= P(\u03931 ) \u00d7 P(\u0393//\u03931 ). In fact, the strict transform of E1 in the\nfull blowup P (\u0393) can be identified with P (\u03931 ) \u00d7 P (\u0393//\u03931 ). To see this, note that by proposition 3.4, the\n40\n\n\fintersection in P (\u0393) of distinct exceptional divisors E1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Ep is non-empty if and only if after reordering,\nthe corresponding core subgraphs of \u0393 form a flag. This means, for example, that E1 \u2229 EI 6= \u2205 if and only if\nthe flag corresponding to I has a subflag of core subgraphs contained in \u03931 , and the remaining core subgraphs\nform a flag containing \u03931 . In this way, we blow up appropriate linear spaces in P(\u03931 ) and in P(\u0393/\u03931 ). the\nresult is P (\u03931 ) \u00d7 P (\u0393//\u03931 ) \u2282 P (\u0393). The chain \u03c41 is an S 1 -bundle over the chain \u03c3P(\u03931 ) \u00d7 \u03c3P(\u0393//\u03931 ) (slightly\nmodified along the boundaries as above), and the monodromy map is the product of the monodromies on\neach factor. (The monodromy takes place on P (\u03931 ) \u00d7 P (\u0393//\u03931 ). In the end, one takes the S 1 -bundle over\nm(\u03c3P(\u03931 ) \u00d7\u03c3P(\u0393//\u03931 ) ).) But this yields exactly (8.18). The result for a general m(\u03c4I ) is precisely analogous. To\ncompute N , suppose \u0393 has exactly k core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 ( \u0393. (This means that P (\u0393) will have k exceptional\ndivisors Ei .) Consider the commutative ring\n(8.19)\n\nR := Q[x1 , . . . , xk ]/(x21 , . . . , x2k , M1 , . . . , Mr ),\n\nwhere we think of the xi as corresponding to exceptional divisors Ei on P (\u0393), and the Mj are monomials\ncorresponding to empty intersections of the Ei . The notation means that we factor the polynomial ring\nin the xi by the ideal generated by the indicated elements. We may if we like drop the Mj from the\nideal. This will simply mean the column vector on which N acts will have many entries equal to 0. As\na vector\nQ space, we can identify R with the free vector space on \u03c31 and the \u03c4I by mapping \u03c31 7\u2192 1 and\n\u03c4I 7\u2192 i\u2208I xi . With this identification, the monodromy map m is given (compare (8.18)) by multiplication\nby (1 \u2212 x1 )(1 \u2212 x2 ) * * * (1 \u2212 xk ). But the map R \u2192 Endvec. sp. (R) given by multiplication is a homomorphism\nof rings, so log(m) is given by (note x2i = 0)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nxi .\n(8.20)\nlog (1 \u2212 x1 ) * * * (1 \u2212 xk ) = \u2212\nP\nThus N is the matrix for the map given by multiplication by \u2212 xi . If we ignore the relations Mj and\njust write the matrix for the action on Q[x1 , . . . , xk ]/(x21 , . . . , x2k ), it has size 2k \u00d7 2k and is strictly upper\ntriangular. For k = 3, the matrix is \u2212N (3) (8.11).\n9. Renormalization: the removal of log-poles\nRecall we have defined sdd(\u0393), the degree of superficial divergence of a graph with respect to a given\nphysical theory, (2.2). The choice of the theory determines a differential form \u03c9\u0393 associated to \u0393. We will\nbe interested in the logarithmic divergent case, when sdd(\u0393) \u2265 0, but \u03c9\u0393 has been chosen such that it only\nhas log-poles, see in particular section 7.4. The affine integral in this case will be overall logarithmically\ndivergent, but this overall divergence can be eliminated by passing to the associated projective integral. If,\nfor all core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393, we have sdd(\u0393\u2032 ) < 0, then the projective integral actually converges and we\nare done. If \u0393\u2032 > 0 for some subgraph, then one is obliged to manipulate the differential form as described in\nsection 7 above. To simplify notation, from now on we assume that all graphs and subgraphs have sdd \u2264 0,\nwhile all following lemmas hold similarly for higher degrees of divergence with the appropriate choice of \u03c9II .\nBelow, we spell all results out for the case \u03c9II = \u03a92n\u22121 /\u03c8\u03932 , and we set \u03c8\u0393 \u2261 \u03c8(\u0393).\nLemma 9.1. Let \u0393\u2032 ( \u0393 be core graphs and assume sdd(\u0393) = 0. Let L \u2282 X\u0393 \u2282 P(\u0393) be the coordinate\nlinear space defined by the edges occurring in \u0393\u2032 . Let \u03c0 : PL \u2192 P(\u0393) be the blowup of L. Then \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9\u0393 has a\nlogarithmic pole on E if and only if sdd(\u0393\u2032 ) = 0. Similarly, the pullback of \u03c9\u0393 to the full core blowup P (\u0393)\n(cf. formula (3.3)) has a log pole of order along the exceptional divisor E\u0393\u2032 associated to \u0393\u2032 if and only if\nsdd(\u0393\u2032 ) = 0.\nProof. We give the proof for \u03c64 -theory. Let the loop number |\u0393| = m so the graph has 2m edges (2.2). Let\nX\ndi \u2227 * * * \u2227 dA2m = A2m d(A1 /A2m ) \u2227 * * * \u2227 d(A2m\u22121 /A2m ).\n(9.1)\n\u03a92m\u22121 =\n(\u22121)i Ai dA1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dA\n2m\n\nThen\n(9.2)\n\n\u03c9\u0393 =\n\n\u03a92m\u22121\n.\n\u03c8\u03932\n\nSuppose L : A1 = * * * = Ap = 0. We can write the graph polynomial ([2], prop. 3.5)\n(9.3)\n\n\u03c8\u0393 = \u03c8\u0393\u2032 (A1 , . . . , Ap )\u03c8\u0393//\u0393\u2032 (Ap+1 , . . . , A2m ) + R\n41\n\n\fwhere the degree of R in A1 , . . . , Ap is strictly greater than deg \u03c8\u0393\u2032 = |\u0393\u2032 |. Let ai = Ai /A2m , and let\nbi = ai /ap , i < p. Locally on P we can take b1 , . . . , bp\u22121 , ap , ap+1 , . . . , A2m as local coordinates and write\n(9.4)\n\n\u2032\n\n|\n\u03c9\u0393 = \u00b1ap\u22122|\u0393\np\n\ndap db1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 da2m\u22121\n\u2227\n.\nap\nF2\n\nHere F is some polynomial in the ai 's and the bj 's which is not divisible by ap . The assertion for the blowup\nof L follows immediately. The assertion for P (\u0393) is also clear because we can find a non-empty open set on\nP(\u0393) meeting L such that the inverse images in P (\u0393) and in PL are isomorphic.\n\u0003\nWe want to state the basic renormalization result coming out of our monodromy method. For this, we\nrestrict to the case\nsdd(\u0393\u2032 ) \u2264 2, \u2200\u0393\u2032 \u2286 \u0393,\n\n(9.5)\n\nwith an understanding that appropriate forms \u03c9II (\u0393\u2032 ) have been chosen so that the differential forms has\nlog-poles only. The following lemma applies then to \u03c64 -theory. A physicist wishing to apply our results to\nanother theory needs only check the lemma holds with \u03c9\u0393 replaced by the integrand given by Feynman rules.\nLemma 9.2. Let \u03c4V\u03b5 be the chains on P(\u0393) constructed above (section 4) (including the case \u03c4P\u03b5 (\u0393) = \u03c3\u03b5 ).\nThen, assuming (9.5), we will have\nZ\n(9.6)\n\u03c9\u0393 = O(| log |\u03b5||k ), |\u03b5| \u2192 0\n\u03c4V\u03b5\n\nfor some k \u2265 0.\nProof. We first consider the integral for the chain \u03c3\u03b5 = \u03c4P\u03b5 (\u0393) . Locally on the blowup P (\u0393) the integrand will\nlook like (9.4) but there may be more than one log form; i.e. \u03c9\ne dap1 /ap1 \u2227* * *\u2227dapk /apk . An easy estimate for\nsuch an integral over a compact chain satisfying aj \u2265 \u03b5 gives C(| log \u03b5|)k . The integrals over \u03c4V\u03b5 , V ( P (\u0393)\ninvolve first integrating over one or more circles. Locally the chain is an (S 1 )p -bundle over an intersection\nx1 = * * * = xp = 0 in local coordinates. We may compute the integral by first taking residues. V will be the\nclosure of a torus orbit in P (\u0393) associated to a flag \u0393p ( * * * ( \u03931 ( \u0393 (proposition 3.4). We may assume\nxi is a local equation for the exceptional divisor in P (\u0393) associated to \u0393i \u2282 \u0393. By lemma 9.1, our integrand\nwill have a pole on xi = 0 if and only if sdd(\u0393i ) = 0. (Note that the integrand has no singularities on \u03c4V\u03b5 ,\nso we may integrate in any order.) The situation is confusing because sdd(\u0393i ) < 0 \u21d2 sdd(\u0393//\u0393i ) > 0 so\none might expect non-log growth in this case. The problem does not arise, because the residue will vanish.\nAssuming sdd(\u0393i ) = 0, \u2200i, the residue integral is\nZ\n\u03c9\u0393p \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c9\u0393//\u03931 .\n(9.7)\nQ\nj\n\n\u03b5\n\u03c4P\n(\u0393\n\nj //\u0393j+1 )\n\nSince sdd(\u0393i //\u0393i+1 ) = 0, we may simply write (9.7) as a product of integrals and argue as above.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe want now to apply the argument sketched in the introductionR to our situation. There is one mathematical point which must be dealt with first. We want to consider \u03c3t \u03c9\u0393 as a function of t. Here we must\nbe a bit careful. For t = \u03b5ei\u03b8 and |\u03b8| << 1 we are ok, but as \u03b8 grows, our chain may meet X\u0393 . Topologically,\nwe have (proposition 6.3) the chains c\u0303\u03b7,\u03b5,\u03b8 which miss X\u0393 and which represent the correct homology class in\nH\u2217 (P(\u0393) \u2212 X\u0393 , \u2206t \u2212 X\u0393 \u2229 \u2206t ), but one must show our integral depends only on the class in homology relative\nto \u2206t , i.e. \u03c9\u0393 integrates to zero over any chain on \u2206t \u2212 X\u0393 \u2229 \u2206t . Intuitively, this is because \u03c9\u0393 |\u2206t = 0, but,\nbecause \u2206t has singularities it is best to be more precise. Quite generally, assume U is a smooth variety of\ndimension r, and D \u2282 U is a normal crossings divisor (i.e. for any point u \u2208 U there exist local coordinates\nx1 , . . . , xr near u, and p \u2264 r such that D : x1 x2 * * * xp = 0 near u). One has sheaves\n(9.8)\n\n\u03a9qU (log D)(\u2212D) \u2282 \u03a9qU \u2282 \u03a9qU (log D)\n\nwhere \u03a9qU is the sheaf of algebraic (or complex analytic; in fact, either will work here) q-forms on X,\nand \u03a9qU (log D) is obtained by adjoining locally wedges of differential forms dxi /xi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p. Locally,\n\u03a9qU (log D)(\u2212D) := x1 x2 * * * xp \u03a9qU (log D). All three sheaves are easily seen to be stable under exterior\n42\n\n\fdifferential (for varying q). The resulting complexes calculate the de Rham cohomology for (U, D), U, (U \u2212D)\nrespectively, [7]. Note that in the top degree r = dim U we have\ndx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxp\n(9.9)\n\u03a9rU (log D)(\u2212D) = OU * x1 x2 * * * xp\ndxp+1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxr = \u03a9rU .\nx1 x2 * * * xp\nIt follows that we get a maps\n\u03a9rU [\u2212r] \u2192 \u03a9\u2217U (log D)(\u2212D);\n\nr\n\u0393(U, \u03a9rU ) \u2192 HDR\n(U, D).\nR\nIn particular, taking U = P(\u0393) \u2212 X\u0393 , we see that integrals ch.rel.\u2206t \u03c9\u0393 are well-defined.\n\n(9.10)\n\nTheorem 9.3. We suppose given a graph \u0393 such that all core subgraphs \u0393\u2032 \u2286 \u0393 have superficial divergence\nsdd(\u0393\u2032 ) \u2264 0 for a given physical theory. Let \u03c9\u0393 be the form associated to the given theory. Let N be the\nupper-triangular matrix of size K \u00d7 K described in the previous section, where K is the number of chains of\ncore subgraphs\n\u0393p ( * * * ( \u0393.\nThen the lefthand side of the expression below is single-valued and analytic for t in a disk about 0 so the\nlimit\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ebR\n\u03c9\u0393\nt\n\u03c4P\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec (\u0393)\na1\n..\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nlog t \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\uf8f7\n)\uf8ec R\n(9.11)\nlim exp(\u2212N\n\uf8f7 = \uf8ed .. \uf8f8\n2\u03c0i \uf8ec \u03c4 t \u03c9\u0393 \uf8f7\n|t|\u21920\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed V\nak\n..\n.\nexists.\n\nProof. The proof proceeds as outlined in section 1.3. N is chosen to be nilpotent and such that the lefthand\nside has no monodromy. The lemma 9.2 assures that terms have at worst log growth. Since they are\nsingle-valued on D\u2217 , they extend to the origin.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.4. It is time to compare what we are calculating here with what a physicist computes according\nto Thm.(7.3). The transition is understood upon noticing that in our constructions of chains, we pick up the\nresidue from each exceptional divisor by computing the monodromy. In physics we iterate those residues as\niterated integrals. Below the top entry a1 this gives different rational weights to them in according with the\nscattering type formula of [6]. We discuss this below in section (9.1).\nR\nDefinition 9.5. With notation as above, the renormalized value \u03c3 \u03c9\u0393 is the top entry in the column vector\n!\na1\nt\nexp(+N log\n)\n.. .\n2\u03c0i\n.\nR\nRemark 9.6. Note that the terms \u03c4 t \u03c9\u0393 on the lefthand side of (9.11) may be calculated recursively. As\nV\nin lemma 9.2 above, V corresponds to a flag of core subgraphs of \u0393. As in formula (9.7), the integral dies\nunless all the \u0393i //\u0393i+1 are log divergent. In this case, one gets\nYZ\n\u03c9\u0393i //\u0393i+1 .\n(9.12)\n(2\u03c0i)p\u22121\nt\n\u03c4P\n(\u0393\n\ni //\u0393i+1 )\n\nIf, in addition, the subquotients \u0393i //\u0393i+1 are primitive, i.e. they are log divergent but have no divergent\nsubgraphs, then the integrals in (9.12) will converge as |t| \u2192 0. Upto a term which is O(t) and can be\nignored in the limit, they may be replaced by their limits as t \u2192 0. These entries in (9.11) may then be\ntaken to be constant.\n\nExample 9.7.

Indeed, the flag\n(\n\n(9.22)\n\n(\n\ncorresponds to a tree with two edges. The term \u223c ln2 t comes from the cut C which corresponds to both of\nthese edges. The complement is the empty cut, whose tree factorial is 3! simply. As we took a derivative\nwith respect to ln t, we get a factor of aug(\u0393) = 3, which leaves us with a factor 3/3! = 1/2.\nFor\n\n, we note that the tree factorial is 3 instead of 3! (we have two flags instead of one), which\n\nleaves us with a factor 1.\n9.2. Limiting Mixed Hodge Structures. In this final paragraph at the suggestion of the referee we\noutline the structure of a limiting mixed Hodge structure associated to a variation of mixed Hodge structure\nand how it might apply to the Feynman graph amplitudes.\nLet \u0393 be a log divergent graph with n loops and 2n edges. The graph hypersurface X\u0393 : \u03c8\u0393 = 0 is a\nhypersurface in P2n\u22121 , and the Feynman integrand represents a cohomology class\nh\u03a9i\n\u2208 H 2n\u22121 (P2n\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 , C) = H 2n\u22121 (P2n\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 , Q) \u2297 C = HC = HQ \u2297 C.\n(9.23)\n\u03c8\u03932\nThe cohomology group has a mixed Hodge structure, which means there are defined two filtrations:\n(i) The weight filtration W\u2217 HQ which is defined over Q and increasing. It looks like\n(9.24)\n\n0 \u2282 W2n HQ \u2282 W2n+1 HQ \u2282 * * * \u2282 W4n\u22122 HQ = HQ .\n\nBlowing up on X\u0393 so it becomes a normal crossings divisor D\u2217 , there is a spectral sequence relating the\ngraded pieces W2n\u22121+i /W2n\u22121+i\u22121 to the Tate twist by \u2212i of the cohomology in degree 2n \u2212 1 \u2212\nSi of the\nW\ncodimension i \u2212 1 strata of D. (So, for example, gr2n\nis related to \u2295j H 2n\u22122 (Dj )(\u22121) where D = Dj .)\n(ii) The Hodge filtration F \u2217 HC which is defined over C and decreasing:\n(9.25)\n\n(0) \u2282 F 2n\u22121 \u2282 F 2n\u22122 \u2282 * * * \u2282 F 1 = HC .\n\nThe filtrations are subject to the compatibility condition that the filtration\n.\n(9.26)\nF p (grqW \u2297 C) := F p HC \u2229 Wq \u2297 C F p HC \u2229 Wq\u22121 \u2297 C\n\nis the Hodge filtration of a pure Hodge structure of weight q. (This is simply the condition that F \u2217 grqW \u2297 C\nq\u2212p+1\n\nbe q-opposite to its complex conjugate, i.e. that grqW \u2297 C = F p \u2295 F\nfor any p.)\np\np+1\nLet us say that a class \u03c9 \u2208 HC has Hodge level p if \u03c9 \u2208 F HC \u2212 F\nHC . An important problem is\nto determine the Hodge level of the Feynman form (9.23). One may speculate that the Hodge level of the\nFeynman form equals the transcendental weight of the period. (The transcendental weight of a multizeta\nnumber \u03b6(n1 , . . . , np ) is the sum of the ni .) For example, in [4] one finds many examples of Feynman\namplitudes of the form \u2217\u03b6(N ) where * is rational. In all known cases N = 2n \u2212 3. To estimate the Hodge\nlevel, one may use theS\npole order filtration [7], 3.12. One blows up on X\u0393 \u2282 P2n\u22121 to replace X by a normal\nr\ncrossings divisor D = i=1 Di . Let \u03c9 on P2n\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 be a (2n \u2212 1)-form and let I \u2282 {1, . . . , r} be the indices\ni such that \u03c9 has a pole along Di . Write pi + 1 for the order of this pole, with pi \u2265 0. Then the Hodge level\n45\n\n\fP\nof \u03c9 is \u2265 2n \u2212 1 \u2212 pi . (For a more precise statement, see op. cit.) For example, if X\u0393 is smooth (this\nhappens only when n = 1) one would get p1 = 1 so the Hodge level would be \u2265 2n \u2212 2.\nProposition 9.8. For the Feynman form, at least 2 of the pi \u2265 1. The pole order calculation thus suggests\nthe Hodge level of the Feynman form above is \u2264 2n \u2212 3.\nProof. The situation for n = 1 is trivial, so we assume n \u2265 2. The space of symmetric n \u00d7 n-matrices has\ndimension d := n(n+1)\n. Let Pd\u22121 be viewed as the projectivized space of such matrices, so a point corresponds\n2\nto a matrix upto scale. The determinant of the universal matrix defines a hypersurface X \u2282 Pd\u22121 . More\ngenerally, we define Xp \u2282 Pd\u22121 to be the locus where the rank of the corresponding symmetric matrix is\nin Pd\u22121 . Points in Xp will\n\u2264 n \u2212 p. We have X = X1 , and it is easy to see that Xp has codimension p(p+1)\n2\nhave multiplicity \u2265 p on X .\nThere is an inclusion \u03c1 : P2n\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Pd\u22121 such that X\u0393 = X \u2229 P2n\u22121 . Points of X2 \u2229 P2n\u22121 will have\nmultiplicity \u2265 2 in X\u0393 and codimension \u2264 3 in P2n\u22121 . This means that in the local ring on P2n\u22121 at a\ngeneral point of X2 \u2229 P2n\u22121 , there will be functions x1 , x2 , x3 which form part of a system of coordinates\non P2n\u22121 such that a local defining equation \u03c8 for X\u0393 lies in (x1 , x2 , x3 )2 . We may construct our normal\ncrossings divisor D as above by first blowing up X2 \u2229 P2n\u22121 in P2n\u22121 . Subsequent blowups will not affect\nthe pole order, which may be computed at the generic point of the exceptional divisor E. We have\n(9.27)\n\ndx1 dx2 dx3 * * *\nx2 dx1 d(x2 /x1 )d(x3 /x1 ) * * *\n= 14\n.\n2\n\u03c8\nx1 \u03c6(x1 , x2 /x1 , x3 /x1 , . . .)\n\nIt follows that the Feynman form has a double pole on E as well as a double pole on the strict transform of\nX\u0393 in the blowup.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.9. (i) To give a complete proof that the Hodge level is \u2264 2n \u2212 3 one would have to show the\ndouble order pole was not killed by an exact form.\n(ii) It would be exciting to be able to say something about the weight filtration on H 2n\u22121 (P2n\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 ).\n(iii) The data in [4] suggests that double zetas which occur will have transcendental weight 2n \u2212 4. For\nexample, the bipartite graph \u0393 consisting of the 12 edges joining sets of 3 and 4 vertices has Feynman\namplitude a rational multiple of \u03b6(3, 5). In general, a calculation as above shows X3 \u2229 P2n\u22121 has multiplicity\n\u2265 3 and codimension \u2264 6. If one could show that for the bipartite \u0393 that this codimension drops to 5, then\nthe same argument as above would yield 3 poles with pi \u2265 1, suggesting a Hodge level 2n \u2212 4.\nNext we should consider the mixed Hodge structure necessary for the relative period calculation. Recall\n(3.3) we work in a toric blowup P = P (\u0393) \u2192 P2n\u22121 . Let B \u2282 P be the complement of the big toric orbit in\nP . It is the union of the strict transform of the coordinate divisor \u2206 \u2282 P2n\u22121 and the exceptional divisors.\nLet Y \u2282 P be the strict transform of X\u0393 . The relevant cohomology group is the middle group in the sequence\n(9.28)\n\nH 2n\u22122 (B \u2212 Y \u2229 B; Q) \u2192 H 2n\u22121 (P \u2212 Y, B \u2212 Y \u2229 B; Q) \u2192 H 2n\u22121 (P \u2212 Y, Q).\n\nIf all the subgraphs \u0393\u2032 ( \u0393 have sdd(\u0393\u2032 ) < 0, then renormalization is unnecessary. The Feynman amplitude\nas we have defined it is simply a period of the mixed Hodge structure (9.28). The weight filtration for the\ngroup on the left involves the cohomology of the strata of the normal crossings divisor B. For example, we\nhave an exact sequence\n(9.29)\n\nH 0 (B(1) \u2212 Y \u2229 B(1) , Q) \u2192 H 0 (B(0) \u2212 Y \u2229 B(0) , Q) \u2192 W0 H 2n\u22122 (B \u2212 Y \u2229 B(0) , Q).\n\nHere we write B(i) for the disjoint union of the components of the strata of dimension i. We know from\ncorollary 5.3 that Y \u2229 B(0) = \u2205, and a bit of thought about the combinatorics of B(i) , i = 0, 1 reveals that\nW0 H 2n\u22122 (B \u2212 Y \u2229 B, Q) = Q(0). This gives a map of the trivial Hodge structure Q(0) to our period motive:\n(9.30)\n\nQ(0) \u2192 H 2n\u22121 (P \u2212 Y, B \u2212 Y \u2229 B; Q).\n\nWhen the period is a rational multiple of \u03b6(2n \u2212 3) we expect that there is a map of Hodge structures\nQ(3 \u2212 2n) \u2192 H 2n\u22121 (P2n\u22121 \u2212 X\u0393 , Q) and that the extension of Q(3 \u2212 2n) by Q(0) associated to \u03b6(2n \u2212 3) is\na subquotient of (9.28).\nFinally the main focus of this paper has been the renormalization case when one or more proper subgraphs\nof \u0393 has sdd = 0. In this case, the Feynman form will have a pole along one or more divisor in B, so (9.28)\nis no longer the relevant Hodge structure. In this case, we work with the limiting mixed Hodge structure\n46\n\n\f2n\u22121\nHlim associated to Ht := H 2n\u22121 (P\n\u2212 X\u0393 , \u2206t \u2212 \u2206t \u2229 X\u0393 ). Let D be a small disk around t = 0, and\nS\n\u2217\nlet D = D \u2212 {0}. Then HD\u2217 = t6=0 Ht becomes a local system on D\u2217 . Let HD\u2217 = HD\u2217 \u2297 OD\u2217 be the\ncorresponding analytic bundle. If we untwist by the monodromy, we get a trivial local system (h = dim Ht )\n\u223c exp(\u2212N log t)HD\u2217 \u2282 HD\u2217 .\n(9.31)\nCh \u2217 =\nD\n\nSince this local system is trivial, it extends (trivially) across t = 0. It also has a canonical Q-structure\ndefined from the Q-structure at any point t0 6= 0. The analytic bundle HD\u2217 has a Hodge filtration F \u2217 HD\u2217\ncoming from the Hodge filtrations on the Ht . (Note the Hodge filtration is not horizontal, so there is no\nHodge filtration on the local system HD\u2217 .) From (9.31) we get a canonical trivialization of the analytic\nh\nbundle HD\u2217 \u223c\n= OD\n\u2217 and hence a canonical extension across t = 0. One can show [5], 2.1(i) that the Hodge\nfiltration extends across t = 0 as well.\nThus, on the fibre H0 we have a Hodge filtration and a Q-structure. If you think in terms of periods,\n\u2228\ni.e. using the pairing H0,Q\n\u00d7 H0 \u2192 C, the above description of the Hodge filtration as a limit across t = 0\ncoincides with the computation (9.11). What we have not given is the weight filtration. This monodromy\nweight or limiting weight filtration is more subtle, essentially being determined by the endomorphism N\ntogether with the given weight filtrations on the fibres Ht . We hope that the computation of N in this\npaper will help to understand this structure, but at the moment the weight structures on the Ht are not\nwell enough understood to say more.
