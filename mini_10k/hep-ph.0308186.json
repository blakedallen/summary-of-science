Small corrections to the ILL spectra are considered.\n\nIntroduction\nIt has many times been underlined (see e.g. recent reviews [1, 2]) that it is\nimportant to have an exact knowledge of the reactor antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304e ) energy\nspectrum for planning and for analyzing the experiments on neutrino intrinsic\nproperties and on searches for New Physics at reactors.\nIn widely used Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR, VVER in Russian abbreviation) summed U and Pu isotope fission rate is \u223c 3.1 \u00d7 1019 /s per 1 GW\nthermal power. About N\u03bd \u2248 6.7 \u03bd\u0304e are emitted per one fission event. 75% of\nthem belong to the energy range E < 1.80 MeV, below the threshold of the\ninverse beta decay reaction on proton. Quantity N\u03bd receives contribution from\nsix sources:\nN\u03bd = F N + U N + \u03b4 F N\n(1)\n\u2217 kopeykin@polyn.kiae.su\n\u2020 mikaelyan@polyn.kiae.su\n\u2021 sinev@polyn.kiae.su\n\n1\n\n\fHere F N \u2248 5.5 \u03bd\u0304e /fission represents summed contribution from beta decays of\nfission fragments of four fissile isotopes 235 U, 239 Pu, 238 U and 241 Pu, undistorted\nby their interaction with reactor neutrons, U N \u2248 1.2 \u03bd\u0304e /fission comes from\nbeta decay of 239 U \u21d2 239 Np \u21d2 239 Pu chain produced via neutron radiative\ncapture in 238 U and \u03b4 F N < 0.03 \u03bd\u0304e /fission originate from neutron capture in\naccumulated fission fragments and give small but not negligible local distortions\nof the total energy spectrum of the reactor \u03bd\u0304e .\nPlan of this report is as follows:\nFirst, we present a short (and incomplete) overview of a half a century long\nhistory, which has led to the present understanding of the reactor antineutrinos.\nSecond, we give new results on the computed evolution of \u03bd\u0304e energy spectra\ncorresponding to four fissile isotopes vs fuel irradiation time and their decay\nafter the end of the irradiation; we compare all available data and estimate\nrelevant uncertainties.\nAfter these data are presented on antineutrinos due to neutron radiative\ncapture in 238 U and in accumulated fission fragments.\nFinally we consider small corrections to the ILL spectra.\n\n1\n\nShort history\n\nAlvarez (unpublished report, 1949 y) did historically the first estimation of the\nreactor \u03bd\u0304e spectrum using conception of fission radiation developed by K. Way\nand E. Wigner [3]. The next were Perkins and King in 1958 y [4]. These studies\nwere stimulated by B. Pontecorvo's proposal to look for Cl \u21d2 Ar transitions\nnear atomic reactor (1946 y) and by famous F. Reines \u2212 C. Cowan experiments.\nAt that time and many years after it was assumed that the only source of reactor\nantineutrinos is the decay of 235 U fission fragments.\nKurchatov Institute's Rovno group in 1974-77 yy noticed that in nuclear\nreactors fission of other heavy isotopes produces flux of comparable to that of\n235\nU and their energy spectra can be quite different from that of 235 U, which,\namong other effects, would cause time variation of the neutrino induced reaction\ncross sections (burn up effect) [5]. Calculated energy spectrum for \u03bd\u0304e emitted\nby 239 Pu fission fragments was first published in [6] and for each of four fissile\nisotopes was given in [7]. F. Avignone III et al. in 1980 y were the first to\npublish results on 238 U [8]. B. Davis, P. Vogel et al. in 1979 y [9] also calculated\nspectrum for 239 Pu and P. Vogel, G. Schenter et al. published results for four\nfissile isotopes in 1981 y [10]. In these publications mainly \"high\" energy parts\n(E > 1 \u2212 1.5 MeV) of the antineutrino spectra were presented.\nQuoted calculations done in 1976-1981 years [6-10] have confirmed the idea\nthat \u03bd\u0304e spectra associated with fission of different isotopes considerably differ\none from another. Thus, relative to \u03bd\u0304e spectrum generated in the decay of 235 U\nfission fragments, fission of 238 U gives much harder spectrum while 239 Pu fission\nproduces \u03bd\u0304e of lower energies. The absolute values of each of the four spectra was\nestablished, however, with large uncertainties associated with poor knowledge of\nthe decay schemes of short lived fission fragments, which significantly contribute\n\n2\n\n\fto the hard part of the \u03bd\u0304e spectra.\nAccurate knowledge of the \u03bd\u0304e spectra came from experiments in which relevant beta-electron spectra were measured. Electrons and \u03bd\u0304e come from the\nsame beta decay process and are closely related. This simple idea is used in the\nconversion method in which \u03bd\u0304e spectrum can be reconstructed (at least for not\ntoo low energies) if the spectrum of fission electrons is known. This idea was\nfirst proposed and used for 235 U by C. Muehlhause and S. Oleksa in 1957 [11]\nand by F. Reines group in 1959 y [12]. Later the correlation between calculated\nelectron and \u03bd\u0304e fission spectra was analyzed in 1979-1981 yy in already quoted\npapers [9, 10], by K. Schreckenbach et al. [13] in 1981 y and by the Rovno group\nin 1982 y [14]. First experiment in which 235 U and 239 Pu fission electron spectra\nhave been measured and their considerable difference observed was performed\nby Rovno group in 1980-1981 yy [15]. The best \u03bd\u0304e spectra for 235 U, 239 Pu and\n241\nPu thermal fission at the neutrino energies E \u2265 2.0 MeV have been found\nby the ILL group in a number of experiments carried out in 1981-1989 yy [16];\nthey accurately measured relevant electron spectra and effectively modified the\nconversion procedure. These ILL spectra above 2 MeV are commonly used now.\nFor 238 U is used spectrum calculated in [10].\nVoloshin, Vysotskii and L. Okun' [17], Akhmedov [18], Vogel and Engel\n[19] in 1986-1989 yy stimulated new efforts to search for anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the neutrino in \u03bd\u0304e , e scattering experiments at reactors and further\nstudies of the components of reactor \u03bd\u0304e spectrum. The Moscow MEPhI group\nin 1989 y calculated time-evolution of \u03bd\u0304e spectra emitted by U and Pu fission\nfragments [20].\nThe fifth component of the spectrum U N , which originates from 238 U(n,\u03b3)\nreaction, was \"discovered\" only in 1996 y [21]. The last component \u03b4 F N , which\ncomes from reactor neutron capture in fission fragments was estimated in [7]\nand considered in [21, 22].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nMain results\nFission antineutrinos from four fissile isotopes\n\nFor each of four fissile isotope we calculate the time evolution of the \u03bd\u0304e spectrum\nduring fuel irradiation time ton and its decay as a function of time tof f after the\nend of irradiation. Calculations involve summation of all beta branches of 571\nfission fragments. For fragments yields we use data compiled in [23]. For the\ndecay schemes is used information accumulated in our laboratory during past\n25 years. Our code evaluates the spectra in the energy range 0-10 MeV (200\npoints per 1 MeV) for ton and tof f intervals from 0.2 hour to infinity.\nTime evolution of the four spectra for \u03bd\u0304e energy below 3.5 MeV is presented\nin Tables 1 and 2. One can see that at 3.5 MeV full saturation is achieved\nalready in \u223c1 day time after the beginning of fission process, in 2-3 MeV energy\nrange \u223c 3% increase takes place at long irradiation times while low energies do\nnot reach equilibrium even in 2 years. (In typical PWR reactors 2 year is the\n\n3\n\n\faverage fuel irradiation time at the end of the operational run). In Table 3 one\ncan see that at ton = 2 y 50% of fission \u03bd\u0304e 's are emitted below (1.2-1.3) MeV\nand \u223c 30% of them have energy higher than 2.0 MeV.\nTable 1: Calculated \u03bd\u0304e -spectra (1/(MeV*fission) for 235 U and 239 Pu vs irradiation time ton\n235\n239\nIsotope\nU\nPu\nE,MeV\n1d\n30 d 100 d\n2y\n1d\n30 d 100 d\n2y\n0.05\n0.102 0.216 0.300 0.426 0.165 0.309 0.397 0.502\n0.1\n0.226 0.608 0.897 1.326 0.229 0.720 1.019 1.373\n0.718 1.719 2.007 2.322 0.722 2.013 2.402 2.710\n0.2\n0.3\n1.129 2.029 2.316 2.637 1.043 1.989 2.217 2.446\n1.587 2.184 2.353 2.413 1.475 2.141 2.284 2.331\n0.4\n0.5\n1.866 2.395 2.496 2.543 1.753 2.363 2.442 2.475\n0.6\n1.740 2.277 2.366 2.397 1.739 2.278 2.343 2.362\n1.847 2.366 2.459 2.495 1.854 2.336 2.398 2.420\n0.7\n0.8\n1.868 2.386 2.486 2.527 1.886 2.360 2.426 2.451\n0.9\n1.873 2.355 2.450 2.493 1.885 2.321 2.382 2.409\n1.812 2.137 2.203 2.247 1.798 2.093 2.132 2.160\n1.0\n1.2\n1.702 1.929 1.988 2.033 1.580 1.776 1.809 1.840\n1.541 1.621 1.661 1.702 1.399 1.461 1.482 1.513\n1.4\n1.6\n1.472 1.515 1.522 1.542 1.316 1.355 1.362 1.386\n1.8\n1.378 1.407 1.412 1.432 1.215 1.240 1.245 1.270\n2.0\n1.241 1.257 1.262 1.282 1.082 1.095 1.101 1.125\n2.25\n1.054 1.064 1.068 1.086 0.909 0.916 0.921 0.944\n2.5\n0.887 0.895 0.898 0.912 0.754 0.759 0.763 0.782\n0.768 0.772 0.775 0.785 0.647 0.650 0.653 0.668\n2.75\n3.0\n0.650 0.651 0.651 0.652 0.538 0.539 0.540 0.546\n0.553 0.554 0.554 0.554 0.445 0.445 0.446 0.450\n3.25\n3.5\n0.452 0.452 0.452 0.452 0.355 0.355 0.356 0.358\nFuel continues to emit \u03bd\u0304e after the irradiation is stopped (Table 4).

This process contributes U N \u223c 20% to\nthe total flux. The quantity U N is practically constant over reactor run and\nis known with an uncertainty of 5%. Note, that in reactors with fuel elements\nof natural uranium \u03bd\u0304e production rate in the channel considered is \u223c1.5 times\nhigher.\nNeutron capture in fission fragments can either increase or decrease intensity\ndepending on energy of \u03bd\u0304e (Fig. 2). The term \u03b4 F N (Eq.1) is negative for\nenergies below 0.9 MeV and positive for higher energies; it slowly changes along\nthe reactor run and its contribution to the total flux of \u03bd\u0304e does not exceed\n0.3%. The negative part of \u03b4 F N originates mainly from intensive absorption\nof neutrons in the fragment 135 Xe (T1/2 = 9.1 h, Emax = 0.91 MeV), which is\nproduced in reactor at a rate of \u223c0.07/fission.

These spectra do not contain time dependent\ncontributions due to decay of long-lived fission fragments (see Tables 1, 2) and\ndue to additional radiation associated with neutron capture (Fig. 2), which\naffect part of the \u03bd\u0304e spectra above 1.80 MeV, the threshold of the inverse beta\ndecay reaction on proton. We mention here this point because it may appear\nto be of some importance in searches of very small mixing angle oscillations at\nreactors, which have been discussed at this Conference.\n\nConclusions\nIn this report we have tried to give a short story of the long process of developments in understanding reactor antineutrino source and to outline present\nstatus of the problem. New efforts to improve the accuracy may be needed in\nthe future. So far, however, we do not feel challenges coming from current or\nplanned experiment, which could stimulate such efforts.\n\n6\n\n\fTable 4: Residual \u03bd\u0304e -emission: Ratios of the current 235 U and 239 Pu fission\nantineutrino spectra vs time after the end of fuel irradiation time tof f to that\nat the end of irradiation period ton = 2 years\n235\n239\nIsotope\nU\nPu\nE,MeV\n1d\n10 d\n30 d\n1y\n1d\n10 d\n30 d\n1y\n0.05\n0.762\n0.592\n0.495 6.2(-2)\n0.672\n0.487\n0.386 4.4(-2)\n0.1\n0.830\n0.651\n0.543 6.6(-2)\n0.834\n0.606\n0.478 5.1(-2)\n0.691\n0.395\n0.262 6.2(-2)\n0.734\n0.403\n0.259 4.2(-2)\n0.2\n0.3\n0.572\n0.358\n0.232 4.5(-2)\n0.574\n0.315\n0.188 3.4(-2)\n0.4\n0.343\n0.180 9.5(-2) 8.3(-3)\n0.367\n0.163 8.2(-2) 6.6(-3)\n0.266\n0.120 5.9(-2) 9.2(-3)\n0.292\n0.104 4.6(-2) 7.4(-3)\n0.5\n0.75\n0.261\n0.113 5.5(-2) 2.9(-3)\n0.232 8.4(-2) 3.7(-2) 3.1(-3)\n1.0\n0.194 8.1(-2) 4.9(-2) 4.2(-3)\n0.168 5.6(-2) 3.1(-2) 4.7(-3)\n0.130 7.5(-2) 5.2(-2) 5.9(-3)\n0.106 5.4(-2) 3.6(-2) 7.4(-3)\n1.25\n1.5\n6.8(-2) 4.1(-2) 3.3(-2) 7.6(-3) 6.1(-2) 3.6(-2) 2.9(-2) 1.0(-2)\n3.8(-2) 2.0(-2) 1.8(-2) 8.4(-3) 4.3(-2) 2.6(-2) 2.4(-2) 1.2(-2)\n1.75\n2.0\n3.2(-2) 2.2(-2) 2.0(-2) 9.2(-3) 3.8(-2) 2.9(-2) 2.7(-2) 1.3(-2)\n2.25\n3.0(-2) 2.2(-2) 2.1(-2) 9.6(-3) 3.7(-2) 3.1(-2) 3.0(-2) 1.5(-2)\n2.5\n2.8(-2) 2.1(-2) 2.0(-2) 8.8(-3) 3.6(-2) 3.1(-2) 2.9(-2) 1.4(-2)\n2.75\n2.2(-2) 1.8(-2) 1.7(-2) 7.5(-3) 3.2(-2) 2.8(-2) 2.7(-2) 1.3(-2)\n3.0\n2.0(-3) 1.1(-3) 1.1(-3) 5.8(-4) 1.6(-2) 1.5(-2) 1.4(-2) 7.5(-3)\n3.25\n1.6(-3) 8.7(-4) 8.4(-4) 4.5(-4) 1.3(-2) 1.2(-2) 1.1(-2) 6.0(-3)\n3.5\n1.2(-3) 6.0(-4) 5.8(-4) 3.1(-4) 8.9(-3) 8.2(-3) 7.9(-3) 4.2(-3)\n\nAknowledgements\nThis work is partially funded by grants 1246.2003.2 (Support of leading scientific\nschools) and 03-02-16055 (RFBR).\n\nReferences\n1.
