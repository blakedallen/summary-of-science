First, a large amount of work has been devoted to the structural characterization of real networks,\nthe main contribution being the discovery of their seemingly ubiquitous scale-free (SF) nature [2], characterized\nby a probability P (k) that an element in the network\n(a vertex ) is connected to other k elements (has degree\nk), scaling as a power-law, P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , with a certain\ndegree exponent \u03b3 usually in the range 2 < \u03b3 < 3 [2].\nOn the other hand, a great deal of attention has been\ndrawn by the profound effects that a heterogeneous SF\nconnectivity pattern can have on dynamical processes on\ncomplex networks. In particular, models exhibiting critical phase transitions such as ferromagnets [3], percolation\n[4] or epidemic models [5] have been studied on this class\nof networks. Present understanding of critical behavior\nin complex networks is essentially based on the application of mean-field (MF) techniques [6]. In the study of\ncritical phenomena on regular substrates (lattices), MF\ntheory plays a prominent role. Despite its simplicity,\nit describes qualitatively most phase transitions. Moreover, while in low spatial dimensions fluctuations cannot\nbe neglected, above the upper critical dimension MF is\neven quantitatively correct, providing exact expressions\nfor critical exponents. In the case of complex networks,\nsince they usually fulfill the so-called small-world (SW)\nproperty [7], such systems can be viewed as infinite dimensional, and therefore one can expect MF to provide\nan exact description of dynamical processes taking place\non networks, once degree heterogeneity has been taken\ninto account. Results obtained so far seem to validate\nthis idea, particularly for SF networks [8].\nIn this paper we show the inadequacy of MF theory to\ndescribe some dynamical processes on SF networks, by\nconsidering the absorbing-state phase transition of the\ncontact process (CP) [9]. We develop a MF theory for\n\nthe CP on generic networks, and solve it for SF networks, obtaining expressions for both infinite and finite\nnetworks. These expressions are compared with numerical simulations of the CP on SF networks, which are\nanalyzed applying a finite size scaling (FSS) theory [10].\nOur results show that the the critical exponents of CP\non SF networks cannot be accounted for by MF theory,\nand signal the presence of nontrivial fluctuation effects.\nWe consider the classical CP on generic networks, defined as follows [10]: An initial fraction \u03c10 of vertices is\nrandomly chosen and occupied by a particle. The time\nevolution of the process runs as follows: At each time\nstep t, a particle in a vertex vi is chosen at random.\nWith probability p, this particle disappears. With probability 1\u2212p, on the other hand, the particle may generate\nan offspring. To do so, a vertex vj , nearest neighbor of\nthe vertex vi , is randomly chosen. If vertex vj is occupied by a particle, nothing happens; if it is empty, a\nnew particle is created on vj . In any case, time is updated as t \u2192 t + 1/n(t), where n(t) is the number of\nparticles present at the beginning of the time step [10].\nIn Euclidean d-dimensional lattices, the CP undergoes a\ncontinuous transition at a critical point pc , separating an\nabsorbing phase from an active one [10]. This phase transition is characterized in terms of the order parameter \u03c1,\ndefined as the average density of particles in the steady\nstate. For p > pc , an absorbing phase with \u03c1 = 0 is observed. For p < pc the system sets in an active phase with\na nonzero order parameter, obeying \u03c1 \u223c \u2206\u03b2 for p \u2192 p\u2212\nc ,\nwhere \u2206 = pc \u2212p. Close to pc , the system is further characterized by diverging correlation length and time scales,\nnamely \u03be \u223c |\u2206|\u2212\u03bd\u22a5 and \u03c4 \u223c |\u2206|\u2212\u03bdk . The critical exponents \u03b2, \u03bd\u22a5 and \u03bdk provide a full characterization of the\nphase transition of CP in Euclidean lattices. Below the\ncritical dimension dc = 4, the exponents are nontrivial,\nand depend explicitly on d. For d > dc , the exponents\ntake the classical MF values \u03b2 = \u03bdk = 1, \u03bd\u22a5 = 1/2.\nIn order to gain analytical insight on the behavior of\n\n\f2\nthe CP on complex networks, we consider as usual a MF\nrate equation for the partial densities \u03c1k (t) of occupied\nvertices of degree k [5],\nP from which the total density is\nobtained as \u03c1(t) =\nk \u03c1k (t)P (k). The rate equation\nfor the partial densities in a network characterized by\na degree distribution P (k) and degree correlations given\nby the conditional probability P (k \u2032 |k) that a vertex of\ndegree k is connected to a vertex of degree k \u2032 [11] can be\nthus written as [12]\n\u2202t \u03c1k (t) = \u2212\u03c1k (t) + \u03bbk[1 \u2212 \u03c1k (t)]\n\nX P (k \u2032 |k)\u03c1k\u2032 (t)\nk\u2032\n\nk\u2032\n\n. (1)\n\nThe destruction term, due to the vanishing of particles-\nwith probability p-at vertices of degree k, is proportional to the density of occupied vertices of degree k,\n\u03c1k (t). The creation term, on the other hand, is due to the\ngeneration of offsprings from particles located at nearest\nneighbor vertices of empty vertices of degree k. Thus,\nit is proportional to the probability [1 \u2212 \u03c1k (t)] that a\nvertex of degree k is empty, that it is connected to a\nvertex of degree k \u2032 , P (k \u2032 |k), that this one is occupied,\n\u03c1k\u2032 (t), that it generates an offspring, 1 \u2212 p, and that this\nneighbor chooses to create the offspring on the vertex of\ndegree k under consideration, (1/k \u2032 ). In Eq. (1) we have\nperformed a rescaling of time, introducing the new parameter \u03bb = (1 \u2212 p)/p. For uncorrelated networks, where\nP (k \u2032 |k) = k \u2032 P (k \u2032 )/hki [11], the rate equations take the\nform\n\u2202t \u03c1k (t) = \u2212\u03c1k (t) + \u03bb\n\nk\n[1 \u2212 \u03c1k (t)]\u03c1(t).\nhki\n\n(2)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (2) depends on the nature of\nthe degree distribution. For homogeneous networks, in\nwhich P (k) decays exponentially for large degrees, all vertices are approximately equivalent. Therefore, we have\nk \u2243 hki and \u03c1k (t) \u2243 \u03c1(t), so that the rate equation reads\n \u0303\n \u0303 = \u03bb \u2212 1. This equa\u2202t \u03c1(t) = \u2212\u03bb\u03c12 (t) + \u2206\u03c1(t),\nwhere \u2206\ntion describes the behavior of the CP in an infinite dimensional system; the critical point \u03bbc = 1 (pc = 1/2)\nand the exponent \u03b2 = 1 are thus immediately found [10].\n \u0303\n \u0303 \u2212 e\u2212\u2206t\nMoreover, from the solution \u03c1(t) \u223c \u2206/\u03bb\n, we can\n\u22121\n \u0303\nidentify the relevant characteristic time \u03c4 \u223c \u2206\nand the\ncorresponding exponent \u03bdk = 1.\nFor heterogeneous networks, with a degree distribution\nexhibiting large fluctuations, the solution of Eq. (2) must\nconsider explicitly the k dependence of the partial densities. Information on the active phase is obtained by\nimposing the steady state condition, \u2202t \u03c1k (t) = 0, which\nyields the nonzero solutions\n\u03c1k =\n\n\u03bbk\u03c1/hki\n,\n1 + \u03bbk\u03c1/hki\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1k is now independent of time. In order to determine the critical behavior of the average density \u03c1 as\n\na function of the control parameter \u03bb we focus on the\nself-consistent equation for the order parameter \u03c1. By\ncombining Eq. (3) with the expression for \u03c1, one obtains\n\n\u03c1=\n\n\u03bb\u03c1 X\nkP (k)\n.\nhki\n1 + \u03bbk\u03c1/hki\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nThis equation depends on the full degree distribution. In\nthe case of SF networks, for which the degree distribution in the continuous degree approximation is given by\nP (k) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)m\u03b3\u22121 k \u2212\u03b3 , with m the minimum degree in\nthe network, the solution will depend on the degree exponent \u03b3. Substituting the summation by an integral in\nEq. (4), we obtain in the infinite network size limit (i.e.\nwhen the degree belongs to the range [m, \u221e]) the expression \u03c1 = F [1, \u03b3 \u2212 1, \u03b3, \u2212(\u03bb\u03c1m/hki)\u22121 ], where F [a, b, c, z]\nis the Gauss hyper-geometric function [13]. To evaluate\nthe critical behavior for small \u03c1, we invert this expression\nusing the asymptotic expansion of the hyper-geometric\nfunction for z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, obtaining [18] \u03c1(\u03bb) \u223c (\u03bb\u22121)1/(\u03b3\u22122)\nfor 2 < \u03b3 < 3 and \u03c1(\u03bb) \u223c \u03bb \u2212 1 for \u03b3 > 3. Hence the MF\nsolution in infinite networks gives the critical exponent\n\u03b2 MF = 1/(\u03b3 \u2212 2) for \u03b3 < 3, and \u03b2 MF = 1 for \u03b3 > 3,\nwhile the critical threshold is \u03bbMF\n= 1 (pMF\n= 1/2),\nc\nc\nindependent of the degree exponent.\nThe previous results, corresponding to networks of infinite size, are however strongly affected by finite size\neffects. The difference between an infinite SF network\nand one of finite size N is that the latter has a cut-off or\nmaximum degree kc , which is a function of the network\nsize [14], and that, for uncorrelated networks, scales as\nkc (N ) \u223c N 1/2 [15]. The presence of the cut-off restricts\nthe possible values of the degree to the range [m, kc ].\nFor finite networks, Eq. (4) yields, in the continuous degree approximation, \u03c1 = F [1, \u03b3 \u2212 1, \u03b3, \u2212(\u03bb\u03c1m/hki)\u22121 ] \u2212\n(kc /m)1\u2212\u03b3 F [1, \u03b3 \u2212 1, \u03b3, \u2212(\u03bb\u03c1kc /hki)\u22121 ]. To obtain the\nMF critical behavior for a finite network, we evaluate this\nexpression in the limit \u03c1 \u2192 0 for generic \u03c1kc , obtaining\n!\n \u0303 \u03b3\u22122\nhki\u2206k\nhki\nc\n,\n(5)\nf\n\u03c1=\n\u03bbkc\n\u03bbm\u03b3\u22121\nwhere f (x) is the inverse of the function g(x) = (F [1, \u03b3 \u2212\n1, \u03b3, \u22121/x] + \u0393(\u03b3)\u0393(2 \u2212 \u03b3)x\u03b3\u22121 )/x. For x \u226b 1, f (x)\ndiverges as x1/(\u03b3\u22122) , in agreement with the infinite size\n \u0303 \u03b2 MF . For small arguments, the function f (x)\nlimit \u03c1 \u223c \u2206\nvanishes for x \u2192 x+\n0 with x0 > 0. Therefore, for finite N ,\nif \u2206 is made smaller than a value proportional to kc2\u2212\u03b3 ,\nthen \u03c1 = 0. This indicates that the effective critical point\nis shifted in the active phase in finite networks and that\nthe convergence to the infinite network limit is slow, since\ncorrections vanish as N (2\u2212\u03b3)/2 , i.e., with an exponent\nsmaller than 1.\n\u00bfFrom Eq.

Compatibility with the theoretical behavior given in\nEq. (5) for x \u226b 1 requires that the exponents assume\nthe MF values \u03b2 = 1/(\u03b3 \u2212 2) and \u03bd\u22a5 = 2/(\u03b3 \u2212 2) in\nuncorrelated networks with cut-off scaling as N 1/2 . Thus,\nat pc the function \u03c1\u0304a is expected to decay as\n\u03c1\u0304a (0, N ) \u223c N \u2212\u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 .\n\n-2\n\np = 0.421\np = 0.4215\np = 0.422\n\n(7)\n\nThis fact can be used to estimate the critical point, as\nthe value of p yielding a power-law behavior for \u03c1\u0304a as\na function of N . MF theory predicts in this case an\nexponent \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 = 1/2.\nIn order to check these results, we have simulated numerically the CP on the uncorrelated configuration model\n(UCM) [17], which generates uncorrelated SF networks\nwith arbitrary degree exponent and cut-off kc (N ) \u223c\nN 1/2 . We consider the particular cases \u03b3 = 2.75, 2.5 and\n2.25. Simulations were performed with at least 100 runs\nof the CP for each realization of the network and no less\nthan 100 such realizations for each value of \u03b3 and N .\nWe focus first on the determination of the critical point\nand of the exponent ratio \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 via Eq. (7). In Fig. 1 we\ndisplay the density of active sites in surviving runs \u03c1\u0304a as\na function of the network size, for \u03b3 = 2.75 and several\nvalues of the control parameter p. The critical point is\nidentified as the value of p such that the decay of \u03c1\u0304a vs\nN is a pure power-law, which for this particular value\nof \u03b3 corresponds to pc = 0.4215. In Fig. 2 we show the\ndecay of \u03c1a vs N at criticality, for the three values of \u03b3\nconsidered. In all cases a very clear power-law behavior\nis identified, yielding the exponent ratios \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 = 0.63\nfor \u03b3 = 2.75, 0.70 for \u03b3 = 2.50, and 0.76 for \u03b3 = 2.25.\nNotice that these values are in strong disagreement with\nthe MF prediction \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 = 1/2.\nIn principle the exponent \u03b2 should be determined by\nthe way the steady state density of particles vanishes as a\nfunction of pc \u2212 p in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. However, it turns\n\n10\n\n\u03c1a(0,N)\n\n\u03c1\u0304a (\u2206, N ) = N \u2212\u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 f (\u2206N 1/\u03bd\u22a5 ),\n\n10\n\n\u03c1a(p,N)\n\neffects start to appear, so that one expects deviations\n \u0303 \u03b2 MF . In terms of the order pafrom the decay \u03c1 \u223c \u2206\nrameter this implies that finite size effects are negligible\nonly if \u03c1 \u226b \u03c1\u00d7 = hki/(\u03bbkc ). This condition introduces\nserious constraints on the precision of the numerical estimate of the critical point when performed by measuring\nthe dependence of the \u03c1 on p in the active phase.\nThis difficulty can be overcome by using the finite size\nscaling (FSS) technique [10, 16]. The FSS technique is\nbased on the observation that, even below the critical\npoint, the density of active sites in surviving runs \u03c1\u0304a\nreaches a quasi-steady state whose average is a decreasing\nfunction of the network size N [10].

The\ncritical points and exponents \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 obtained are reported in\nTable I. Solid lines are least squares fits.\n\nout that, even far from pc , it is numerically impossible to\nfulfill the condition \u03c1 \u226b \u03c1\u00d7 that guarantees the absence\nof finite size effects. This is apparent in the inset of Fig. 1,\nwhere one can see that even for p = 0.36 the value of \u03c1\u0304a\nslightly depends on N even for large sizes. This very slow\nconvergence hampers the determination of \u03b2 in the usual\nway.\nThe numerical value of \u03b2 and \u03bd\u22a5 can be however determined via the FSS analysis, by noticing that from Eq. (6)\nwe expect data for the surviving density to collapse onto\na universal function f (x) when plotting N \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 \u03c1\u0304a (\u2206, N )\nas a function of \u2206N 1/\u03bd\u22a5 . Using the values of \u03b2/\u03bd\u22a5 obtained from Fig. 1 we try the collapse for various values\nof \u03b2 (and, as a consequence, of \u03bd\u22a5 ). The best data collapses, shown in Fig. 3, are obtained for the values of \u03b2\nand \u03bd\u22a5 reported in Table I. The scaling function f (x)\nis expected to diverge as x\u03b2 for asymptotically large x.\nWe measure how the numerical scaling functions go for\n\u2032\nlarge x in Fig. 2, finding the effective behavior f (x) \u223c x\u03b2\nwith \u03b2 \u2032 = 1.43, 1.70, and 1.79.

The\nconclusion of this analysis is that the CP in SF networks exhibits an absorbing-state phase transition at a\nnon-zero critical point, whose exponents are not correctly\npredicted by MF theory [19]. This result is surprising: it\nis generally believed that dynamical models on SF networks find in this formalism a correct description, once\ndegree heterogeneity has been taken into account [5]. The\nresults presented here open two clear perspectives for future work. The first is the quest for a theory beyond MF\nfor the CP on heterogeneous networks. The second is the\ninvestigation of the limits of MF theory for generic dynamical processes on heterogeneous topologies. A useful\nindication along these lines is provided by Fig. 4, where\nwe plot the ratio of the standard deviation \u2206\u03c1k over the\nmean density \u03c1k restricted to vertices of degree k, at the\ncritical point. It turns out that the fluctuations are much\nlarger than the average except for the smallest k, all the\nmore so for increasing system size. Hence it is incorrect\nto assume (as MF theory does) that the mean \u03c1k provide all information about the distribution of densities\nfor vertices of a certain degree. The inclusion of these\nlarge fluctuations and the understanding of their role are\nthus key points to develop a theory beyond MF, able to\n\nTABLE I: Critical points and critical exponents for the CP\non UCM networks, compared with MF values.
