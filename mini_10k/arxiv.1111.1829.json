Very often the Equilibrium Principle is\nloosely referred to as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, thus creating a great confusion in the literature. So much that proposing to raise the Equilibrium Principle to the rank of one of the fundamental\nlaws of thermodynamic became necessary [1].

The Minus-First Law deals with a completely isolated system that begins\nin non-equilibrium and ends in equilibrium, following its spontaneous and autonomous evolution. In the\nSecond Law one considers a thermally (but not mechanically) isolated system that begins in equilibrium.\nA time-dependent mechanical action perturbs the initial equilibrium, the action is then turned off and a\nfinal equilibrium will be reached, corresponding to higher entropy.1 At variance with the Minus-First\nLaw, here the system does not evolve autonomously, but rather in response to a driving: we speak in this\ncase of nonautonomous evolution.\nThe use of the qualifiers \"autonomous\" and \"nonautonomous\" reflects here the fact that the set of\ndifferential equations describing the microscopic evolution of the system are autonomous (i.e. they do\nnot contain time explicitly) in cases of the type depicted in Fig. 1, top, and are nonautonomous (i.e.\nthey contain time explictely) in cases of the type depicted in Fig. 1, bottom. Accordingly the Hamilton\nfunction is time independent in the former cases and time dependent in the latter ones (see Sec. 2 below).\nIn order to illustrate the necessity of clearly distinguishing between the two prototypical evolutions\ndepicted in Fig. 1, let us analyze one statement which is often referred to as the second law: after the\n1\n\nThat such final equilibrium state exists is dictated by the Minus-First Law.

While, after the removal of the constraint the system evolves autonomously (hence, in\naccordance to the equilibrium principle will eventually reach a unique equilibrium state), it is often overlooked the fact that the overall process is nevertheless described by a set of nonautonomous differential\nequations (because the removal of the constraint is an instance of a external time-dependent mechanical\nintervention) with the constrained equilibrium as initial state. Then, in accordance with Clausius principle the final state is of higher or same entropy. Thus, this formulation of the second law can be seen as\na special case of Clausius formulation that considers only those external interventions which are called\nconstraint removals.\nBoth the Minus-First Law and the Second Law have to do with irreversibility and the arrow of time.\nWhile since the seminal works of Boltzmann, the main efforts of those working in the foundations of\nstatistical mechanics were directed to reconcile the Minus-First Law with the time-reversal symmetric\nmicroscopic dynamics, recent developments in the theory of fluctuation relations, have brought new and\ndeep insights into the microscopic foundations of the Second Law. As we shall see below, fluctuation\ntheorems highlight in a most clear way the fascinating fact that the Second Law is deeply rooted in the\ntime-reversal symmetric nature of the microscopic laws of microscopic dynamics [5,6].\nThis connection is best seen if one considers the Second Law in the formulation given by Kelvin,\nwhich is equivalent to Clausius formulation [7]:\nSecond Law (Kelvin) No work can be extracted from a closed equilibrium system during a cyclic variation of a parameter by an external source.\nThe field of fluctuation theorems has recently gained much attention. Many fluctuation theorems have\nbeen reported in the literature, referring to different scenarios. Fluctuation theorems exist for classical\ndynamics, stochastic dynamics, and for quantum dynamics; for transiently driven systems, as well as\nfor non equilibrium steady states; for systems prepared in canonical, micro-canonical, grand-canonical\nensembles, and even for systems initially in contact with \"finite heat baths\" [8]; they can refer to different quantities like work (different kinds), entropy production, exchanged heat, exchanged charge,\nand even information, depending on different set-ups. All these developments including discussions of\nthe experimental applications of fluctuation theorems, have been summarized in a number of reviews\n[5,6,9,10].\nIn Sec. 2 we will give a brief introduction to the classical work Fluctuation Theorem of Bochkov\nand Kuzovlev [11], which is the first fluctuation theorem reported in the literature. The discussion of\nthis theorem suffices for our purpose of highlighting the impact of fluctuation theory on dissipation (Sec.\n3) and on the arrow of time issue (Sec. 4). Remarks of the origin of time's arrow in this context are\ncollected in Sec.

As discussed in [5,16\u201318] yet another definition of work is possible, the so called\nR\n\"inclusive work\" W = \u2212 dt\u03bb\u0307t Qt , leading to a different and equally important fluctuation theorem\ninvolving free energy differences [5,19,20]. Without entering the question about the physical meaning of\nthe two quantities W and W0 , it suffices for the present propose to notice that for a cyclic transformation\nW0 = W .5 In the remaining of this section we will restrict our analysis to cyclic transformations\n(\u03bb0 = \u03bb\u03c4 ) in order to make contact with Kelvin postulate and to avoid any ambiguity regarding the\nusage of the word \"work\".\nJust like Eq. (3) constitutes a direct expression of the principle of microreversibility for autonomous\nsystems, so is Eq. (7) a direct expression of the more general principle of microreversibility for nonautonomous systems. Remarkably it expresses the second law in a most clear and refined way.\nIn order to see this it is important to realize that the work W0 is odd under time-reversal. This is so\nbecause W0 is linear in a quantity Q\u0307t , which is the time derivative of an even observable Q. The theorem\nsays that the probability to observe a trajectory corresponding to some work W0 > 0 under the driving\n\u03bb is exponentially larger than the probability to observe the reversed trajectory (corresponding to \u2212W0 )\ne This provides a statistical formulation of the second law\nunder the driving \u03bb.\n5\n\nFor a detailed discussion on the differences between the two work expressions we refer the readers to Sect.

This is the celebrated Kubo formula [13] relating the non equilibrium linear response of the quantity\nQ to the equilibrium correlation function \u03c6(s, \u03c4 ) = hQ\u03c4 Q\u0307s i. As Kubo showed it implies the fluctuationdissipation relation [21], linking, for example, the mobility of a Brownian particle to its diffusion coefficient [22], and the resistance of an electrical circuit to its thermal noise [23,24]\nThis classical derivation of Kubo's formula from the fluctuation theorem is a simplified version of the\nderivation given by Bochkov and Kuzovlev [11]. The corresponding quantum derivation was reported\nby Andrieux and Gaspard [15].\n\n186\n\n4.\n\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n\n187\n188\n189\n190\n\nImplications for the arrow of time question\n\nJarzynski has analyzed in a transparent way how the fluctuation theorem for the inclusive work, W ,\nmay be employed to make guesses about the direction of time's arrow [6]. Here we adapt his reasoning to\nthe case of the exclusive work, W0 , which appears in the fluctuation relation of Bochkov and Kuzovlev,\nEq. (7).\nJust imagine we are shown a movie of an experiment in which a system starting at temperature T =\n(kB \u03b2)\u22121 is driven by a protocol, and we are asked to guess whether the movie is displayed in the same\ndirection as it was filmed or in the backward direction, knowing that tossing of an unbiased coin decided\nthe direction of the movie. When the outcome is +(\u2212), the movie is shown in the same(opposite)\ndirection as it was filmed. Imagine next that we can infer from the analysis of each single frame t the\ninstantaneous values \u03bbt and Qt taken by the parameter and its conjugate observable, respectively. With\nthese we can evaluate the work W0 for the displayed process using Eq. (8). Envision that we find, for\nthe shown movie that \u03b2W0 \u001d 1. If the film was shown in the \"correct\" direction it means that a process\ncorresponding to \u03b2W0 \u001d 1 occurred. If the film was shown backward then it means that a process\ncorresponding to \u03b2W0 \u001c \u22121 occurred (recall that W0 is odd under time-reversal). The fluctuation\ntheorem tells us that the former case occurs with an overwhelmingly higher probability relative to the\n\n\f9 of 12\n\nVersion December 13, 2011 submitted to Entropy\n\nFigure 3. Degree of belief P (+|W0 ) that a movie showing the nonautonomous evolution of\na system is shown in the same temporal order as it was filmed, given that the work W0 was\nobserved and that the direction of the movie was decided by the tossing of an unbiased coin.\n1\n\nP (+|W0 )\n\n0.75\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\u221210\n\n\u22125\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nW0 [kB T ]\n\nprobability of the latter case. Then we can be very much confident that the film was running in the\ncorrect direction. Likewise if we observe \u03b2W0 \u001c \u22121, then we can say with very much confidence the\nthe film depicts the process in the opposite direction as it happened. Clearly when intermediate values\nof \u03b2W0 are observed we can still make well informed guesses about the direction of the movie, but with\nless confidence. The worst scenario arises when we observe W0 = 0, in which case we cannot make\nany reliable guess. The question then arises of how to quantify the confidence of our guesses. This is\na typical problem of Bayesian inference. Before we are shown the movie our degree of belief of the\noutcome +, is given by the prior, P (+) = 1/2 (likewise, P (\u2212) = 1 \u2212 P (+) = 1/2). After we have seen\nthe movie the prior is updated to the posterior, P (+|W0 ), which is the degree of belief that the outcome\n+ occurred, given the observed work W0 . Using Bayes theorem, the posterior is given by\nP (+|W0 ) =\n191\n192\n193\n194\n\nP (W0 |+)\nP (+)\nP (W0 )\n\nwhere P (W0 |+) is the conditional probability to observe W0 given that + occurred, and P (W0 ) is\nthe probability to observe W0 ; i.e., P (W0 ) = P (W0 |+)P (+) + P (W0 |\u2212)P (\u2212). According to the\nfluctuation theorem P (W0 |+)/P (\u2212W0 |+) = e\u03b2W0 and since W0 is odd under time reversal, P (W0 |\u2212) =\nP (\u2212W0 |+). Using these relations together with Eq. (18) one obtains:\nP (+|W0 ) =\n\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\n200\n201\n202\n203\n204\n\n(18)\n\n1\n\n(19)\ne\u2212\u03b2W0 + 1\nFigure 3 displays P (+|W0 ) as a function of W0 . As it should be P (+|W0 ) is larger than 1/2 for\npositive W0 , and vice versa, and is an increasing function of W0 . If W0 is large compared to \u03b2 \u22121 , then\nP (+|W0 ) ' 1, and we can be almost certain that the movie was shown in the forward direction. Vice\nversa, if \u03b2W0 \u001c \u22121, then we can say with almost certainty that the movie has been shown backward.\nThe transition to certainty of guess occurs quite rapidly (in fact exponentially) around |\u03b2W0 | ' 5. Note\nthat that for an autonomous system W0 = 0, implying P (+|W0 ) = P (\u2212|W0 ) = 1/2, meaning that,\nas we have elaborated above, there is no way to discern the direction of time's arrow in an autonomous\nsystem at equilibrium.\nSince the fluctuation theorem (7) holds as a general law regardless of the size of the system, it appears\nthat our ability to discern the direction of time's arrow does not depend on the system size. It is also\n\n\fVersion December 13, 2011 submitted to Entropy\n\n10 of 12\n\n206\n\nworth mentioning the role played by thermal fluctuations in shaping our guesses. Particularly, with a\ngiven observed value W0 , the lower the temperature, the higher is the confidence (and vice-versa).\n\n207\n\n5.\n\n205\n\n208\n209\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214\n215\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n\nRemarks\n\nIt emerges from our discussion regarding the arrow of time (Sec. 4), that the statistical character of\nthe Second Law becomes visible when the energies injected in a system, W0 , are of the same order of\nmagnitude as the thermal fluctuations, kB T , regardless of the system size. This means, that, in contrast to\nwhat is sometimes believed, work fluctuations happen and are experimentally observable in microscopic\nand macroscopic systems alike. As a matter of fact, experimental verifications of the fluctuation theorem\nhave been performed involving both microscopic systems, e.g. a single macromolecule [25,26], and\nmacroscopic systems, e.g., a torsional pendulum [27].\nAs we have mentioned in the introduction, traditionally the question of the emergence of the arrow of\ntime from microscopic dynamics have been addressed within the framework of the Minus-First Law. In\nall existing approaches the arrow of time emerges from the introduction of some extra ingredient which\nin turn then dictates the time direction. Typically, one resorts to a coarse-graining procedure of the\nmicroscopic phase space to describe some state variables. For example, this is so in the theory of Gibbs\nand related approaches, see, e.g., in Ref. [28]. The time arrow is then generated via the observation that\nsuch coarse grained quantities no longer obey time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonian dynamics. More\nfrequently, one resorts to additional assumptions which are of a probabilistic nature: Typical scenarios\nthat come to mind are (i) the use of Boltzmann Stossahlansatz in the celebrated Boltzmann kinetic theory,\n(ii) the assumption of initial molecular chaos in more general kinetic theories that are in the spirit of\nBogoliubov, or, likewise, with Fokker-Planck and master equation dynamics that no longer exhibit an\nexplicit time-reversal invariant structure [28,29]. All such additional elements then induce the result of\na direction in time with future not being equivalent with past any longer.\nHaving stressed the too often overlooked fact that the Second Law does not refer to the traditionally considered scenario of autonomously evolving systems, but rather to the case of nonautonomous\ndynamics, here we have focussed on the emergence of time's arrow in a driven system starting at equilibrium. Having based our derivation on the principle of nonautonomous microreversibility, Fig. 2, the\nquestion arises naturally regarding the origin of the time asymmetry in this case. It originates from\nthe combination of the following two elements: i) The introduction of an explicit time dependence of\nthe Hamiltonian, Eq. (4), ii) The particular shape of the initial equilibrium state, Eq. (5). The first\nbreaks time homogeneity thus determining the emergence of an arrow of time, while the second determines its direction. It is in particular the fact that the initial equilibrium is described by a probability\ndensity function which is a decreasing function of energy, that determines the \u2265 sign in Eq. (10). An\nincreasing probability density function would result in the opposite sign [7,30,31]. In regard to breaking\ntime homogeneity, it is worth commenting that the assumption of nonautonomous evolution has to be\nregarded itself as a convenient and often extremely good approximation in which the evolution \u03bb of the\nexternal parameter influences the system dynamics without being influenced minimally by the system.7\nThis indeed presupposes the intervention of a sort of Maxwell Demon (i.e., the experimentalist), who\n7\n\nIn principle, one should treat the external parameter itself as a dynamical coordinate, and consider the autonomous\nevolution of the extended system.\n\n\fVersion December 13, 2011 submitted to Entropy\n\n11 of 12\n\n245\n\npredisposes things in such a way that the wanted protocol actually occurs. This in turn evidences the\nphenomenological nature of the Second Law. It is not a law that dictates how things go by themselves,\nbut rather how they go in response to particular experimental investigations.\n\n246\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n243\n244\n\n248\n\nThis work was supported by the cluster of excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM) and the\nVolkswagen Foundation (project I/83902).\n\n249\n\nReferences\n\n247\n\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n266\n267\n268\n269\n270\n271\n272\n273\n274\n275\n276\n277\n278\n279\n\n1.
