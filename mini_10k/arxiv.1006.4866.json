A spectroscopic protocol which systematically characterizes both coherent and dissipative processes of\nthe probed chromophores is desired. Here, we show that a set\nof two-color photon-echo experiments performs quantum state\ntomography (QST) of the one-exciton manifold of a dimer by reconstructing its density matrix in real time. This possibility in\nturn allows for a complete description of excited state dynamics\nvia quantum process tomography (QPT). Simulations of a noisy\nQPT experiment for an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble\nof model excitonic dimers show that the protocol distills rich information about dissipative excitonic dynamics, which appears\nnontrivially hidden in the signal monitored in single realizations\nof four-wave mixing experiments.\nnonlinear spectroscopy\ntransfer\n\n|\n\nquantum information processing\n\n|\n\nexcitation energy\n\nthe system is \u03c1(T ) = TrB \u03c1total (T ), where the trace is over the\ndegrees of freedom of the bath. If the initial state is a product,\n\u03c1total (0) = \u03c1(0) \u2297 \u03c1B (0) (always with the same initial bath state\n\u03c1B (0)), then the evolution of the system may be expressed as a linear\ntransformation [13]:\n\u03c1ab (T ) =\n\nxcitonic systems and the processes triggered upon their interaction with electromagnetic radiation are of fundamental physical\nand chemical interest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In nonlinear optical spectroscopy (NLOS), a series of ultrafast femtosecond pulses induces\ncoherent vibrational and electronic dynamics in a molecule or nanomaterial, and the nonlinear polarization of the excitonic system is\nmonitored both in the time and frequency domains [7, 8]. To interpret\nthese experiments, theoretical modeling has proven essential, framed\nwithin the Liouville space formalism popularized by Mukamel [7].\nImplicit in these calculations is the evolution of the quantum state of\nthe dissipative system in the form of a density matrix. The detected\npolarization contains information of the time dependent density matrix of the system, although not in the most transparent way. An\nimportant problem is whether these experiments allow quantum state\ntomography (QST), that is, the determination of the density matrix\nof the probed system at different instants of time [9, 10]. A more\nambitious question is if a complete characterization of the quantum\ndynamics of the system can be performed via quantum process tomography (QPT) [11, 12], a protocol that we define in the next section. In this article, we show that both QST and QPT are possible for\nthe single-exciton manifold of a coupled dimer of chromophores with\na series of two-color photon echo (PE) experiments. We also present\nnumerical simulations on a model system and show that robust QST\nand QPT is achievable even in the presence of experimental noise as\nwell as inhomogeneous broadening.\nThis article provides a conceptual presentation, and interested\nreaders may find derivations and technical details in the Supporting\nInformation (SI).\n\n\u03c7abcd (T )\u03c1cd (0).\n\n[1]\n\ncd\n\nThe central object of this article is the process matrix \u03c7(T ), which is\nindependent of the initial state \u03c1(0). As opposed to master equations\nwhich are written in differential form, Eq. 1 can be regarded as an integrated equation of motion for every T . It holds both for Markovian\nand non-Markovian dynamics of the bath, and it always leads to positive density matrices. Note that \u03c7(T ) completely characterizes the\ndynamics of the system. Preserving Hermiticity, trace, and positivity\nof \u03c1(T ) imply, respectively, the relations (SI-I)\n\nAbbreviations: QPT, quantum process tomography; QST, quantum state tomography; PE, photon echo\n\nE\n\nX\n\n\u03c7abcd (T )\n\n=\n\n\u03c7\u2217badc (T ),\n\n[2]\n\n\u03c7aacd (T )\n\n=\n\n\u03b4cd ,\n\n[3]\n\n\u2217\nzac\n\u03c7abcd (T )zbd\n\n\u2265\n\n0,\n\n[4]\n\nX\na\n\nX\n\nabcd\n\nwhere z is any complex valued vector. Using Eqs. 2 and 3, for a system in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, \u03c7(T ) is determined by d4 \u2212 d2\nreal valued parameters [11]. Operationally, QPT can be defined as an\nexperimental protocol to obtain \u03c7(T ). Spectroscopically, \u03c7(T ) may\nbe reconstructed by measuring \u03c1(T ) (i.e., performing QST) given\nsome choice of initial state \u03c1(0), where the \u03c1(0) are chosen successively from a complete set of initial states [14, 15, 16, 17]. Since\nwe are interested in energy transfer dynamics, this procedure shall\nbe performed at several values of T . In this article, we show how to\nperform QPT for a model coupled excitonic dimer using two-color\nheterodyne photon-echo experiments.\n\nDescription of the system and its interaction with light\nConsider an excitonic dimer interacting with a bath of phonons.

E(t\u2032 ) is the\nslowly varying pulse envelope, which we choose to be Gaussian with\n\u20322\n2\nfixed width \u03c3 for all pulses, E(t\u2032 ) = e\u2212t /2\u03c3 . The polarization\ninduced by the pulses on the molecule located at position r is given\nby P (r, t\u2032 ) = Tr(\u03bc\u0302\u03c1(r, t\u2032 )). This quantity can be\nPFourier decomposed along different wavevectors as P (r, t\u2032 ) = s P s (t\u2032 )eiks *r ,\nwhere the ks are linear combinations of wavevectors of the incoming\nfields. Radiation is produced due to the polarization (proportional to\niP (r, t\u2032 )). We can choose to study a single component P s by detecting only the radiation moving in the direction ks . This is achieved\nby interfering the radiation with a fourth pulse moving in the direction ks , called the local oscillator (LO) [7]. In particular, we shall\nbe interested in the time-integrated signal in the photon-echo (PE)\ndirection, k4 = kP E = \u2212k1 + k2 + k3 .

The preparation of initial states is achieved using the\nfirst two pulses at t1 and t2 . Initial states spanning the single exciton manifold are produced by using the four possible combinations\nof two different carrier frequencies for the first two pulses. In the\nterminology of PE experiments, these pulses define the so-called coherence time interval \u03c4 = t2 \u2212 t1 . The time interval between the\nsecond and third pulses, called the waiting time T = t3 \u2212 t2 , defines\nthe quantum channel [11] which we want to characterize by QPT. Finally, we carry out QST of the output density matrix at the instant\nt3 . This task is indirectly performed by using the third pulse to selectively generate new dipole-active coherences, which are detected\nupon heterodyning with the fourth pulse at t4 , that is, after the echo\ntime t = t4 \u2212 t3 has elapsed. Varying the third and fourth pulse frequencies yields sufficient linear equations for QST. This procedure\nnaturally concludes the protocol of the desired QPT.\nResults\nFor purposes of the QPT protocol, we assume that the structural parameters \u03c9\u03b1g , \u03c9\u03b2g , \u03bc\u03b1g , \u03bc\u03b2g , \u03bcf \u03b1 , and \u03bcf \u03b2 are all known.

For purposes of our discussion, it is enough to consider the complex valued signal.\n\nFootline Author\n\n\fabsorption spectrum, whereas the dipoles can be extracted from xray crystallography [19]. As shown in recent work of our group, with\nenough data from the PE experiments, it is also possible to extract\nthese parameters self-consistently [20, 21]. We proceed to describe\nthe steps of the PE experiment on a coupled dimer that yield a QPT.\nInitial state preparation Before any electromagnetic perturbation,\n\nthe excitonic system is in the ground state \u03c1(\u2212\u221e) = |gihg|. After the first two pulses in the k1 , k2 directions act on the system, the\n,\u03c92\neffective density matrix \u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(0) (at T = 0) is created. This density\n2\nis second order in \u03bb and, combined with the third and fourth pulses,\ndirectly determines the signal. By applying second order perturbation\ntheory and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we can define an\neffective initial state (Fig. 2a\u2013d, SI-III):\nX\n,\u03c92\nC\u03c9p1 C\u03c9q 2 (\u03bcpg * e1 )(\u03bcqg * e2 )\n\u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(0) = \u2212\n2\npq\u2208{\u03b1,\u03b2}\n\n\u00d7Ggp (\u03c4 )(|qihp| \u2212 \u03b4pq |gihg|).\n\n[8]\n\nThis state evolves during the waiting time T to give\n,\u03c92\n\u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(T )\n2\n\n=\n\n1 ,\u03c92\n\u03c7(T )\u03c1\u0303\u03c9\ne1 ,e2 (0),\n\n[9]\n\nwhich holds for T & 3\u03c3, that is, after the action of the first two pulses\nhas effectively ended. Eq. 9 is of the form of Eq. 1, and therefore appealing for our QPT purposes. The purely imaginary coefficients C\u03c9pi\nfor p \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2} are proportional to the frequency components at \u03c9pg\nof the pulse which is centered at \u03c9i :\nC\u03c9pi = \u2212\n\n2\n2\n\u03bb\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2 e\u2212\u03c3 (\u03c9pg \u2212\u03c9i ) /2 ,\ni\n\n[ 10 ]\n\nand the propagator of the optical coherence |iihj| is\nGij (\u03c4 ) = \u0398(\u03c4 )e(\u2212i\u03c9ij \u2212\u0393ij )\u03c4 ,\n\n[ 11 ]\n\nwhich, for simplicity, has been taken to be the product of a coherent\noscillatory term beating at a frequency \u03c9ij and an exponential decay\nwith dephasing rate \u0393ij , assumed to be known. \u0398(\u03c4 ) is the Heaviside function, so the propagator is finite only for times \u03c4 \u2265 0. We\nhave kept only the \u2212k1 and +k2 components because those are the\nonly contributions to the signal at kP E .\nEq. (8) has a simple interpretation, and can be easily read off\nfrom the Feynman diagrams depicted in Fig. 2a\u2013d. Since we will be\nselecting only light in the kP E direction, we keep only the portion of\nthe first pulse proportional to ei\u03c91 (t\u2212t1 ) and only the portion of the\nsecond pulse proportional to e\u2212i\u03c92 (t\u2212t2 ) in Eq. 6. Then, since the\nstate before any perturbation is |gihg|, the first pulse can only resonantly excite the bra in the RWA [7], generating an optical coherence\n|gihp| (where p \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2}) with amplitude C\u03c9p1 . This coherence undergoes free evolution for time \u03c4 under Ggp (\u03c4 ) before the second\npulse perturbs the system. In the RWA, this second pulse can act on\nthe ket of |gihp| to yield |qihp| with amplitude C\u03c9q 2 and on the bra to\ncreate a hole \u2212|gihg| with amplitude C\u03c9p2 , producing Eq. 8. The amplitude of this prepared initial state is proportional to the alignment\nof the corresponding transition dipole moments with the polarization\nof the incoming fields. Once the initial state is prepared, it evolves\nvia \u03c7(T ), which is the object we want to characterize. A possible\nproblem is the contamination of the initial states by terms proportional to a hole\u2212|gihg| every time there is a single-exciton manifold\npopulation |pihp|. This is not a difficulty if we assume:\n\u03c7abgg (T ) = \u03b4ag \u03b4bg ,\n\n[ 12 ]\n\nthat is, if the ground state population does not transform into any\nother state via free evolution. This is reasonable since we may ignore\nprocesses where phonons can induce upward optical transitions. We\nFootline Author\n\nsimilarly neglect spontaneous excitation from the single to double\nexciton states.\nOne can see from Eq. 8 that a set of four linearly independent\ninitial states can be generated by manipulating the frequency components of the pulses through C\u03c9p1 and C\u03c9q 2 . It is sufficient to consider\na pulse toolbox of two waveforms which create |\u03b1i and |\u03b2i with different amplitudes. For instance, by centering one waveform at \u03c9+ in\nthe vicinity of \u03c9\u03b1g and the other at \u03c9\u2212 close to \u03c9\u03b2g , we can simultaneously have:\nC\u03c9\u03b1+\n\n=\n\nC\u03c9\u03b2\u2212 = C \u2032 ,\n\nC\u03c9\u03b2+\n\n=\n\nC\u03c9\u03b1\u2212 = C \u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\n[ 13 ]\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nfor purely imaginary numbers C 6= C . The conceptually simplest\nchoice, which we shall denote the maximum discrimination choice\n(MDC), and which is best for QPT purposes, is two waveforms each\nresonant with only one transition, so C \u2032 \u226b C \u2032\u2032 , and we can neglect C \u2032\u2032 . Four linearly independent initial states can be prepared by\nchoosing the waveform of each of the first two pulses from this pulse\ntoolbox.\nEvolution The system evolves during the waiting time T after the ini-\n\ntial state is prepared. Transfers between coherences and populations\n,\u03c92\nare systematically described by \u03c7(T ). The components of \u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n2\nevolve in time, described by \u03c7(T ), without assuming any particular model for the bath or system-bath interaction, other than Eq. 12.\n,\u03c92\nBy definition, the amplitude of the ij component of \u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(T ) is\n2\nproportional to \u03c7ijqp (T ), with the exception of the gg component,\nwhich is proportional to \u03c7ggpq (T ) + \u03b4pq due to the contamination\nof the hole in the initial state. We note that de-excitation transfers\nfrom the single-exciton manifold to elements involving the ground\nstate (gg, g\u03b1, g\u03b2) are expected to be small, since such processes are\nalso unlikely to occur on femtosecond timescales due to either the\nphonon or the photon bath. Detailed analysis shows that our protocol\ncan detect decay into gg but not into g\u03b1 or g\u03b2. We shall keep these\n\u03c7ggqp (T ) terms in our equations in order to monitor amplitude leakage errors from the single-exciton manifold, providing a consistency\ncheck for treating the single-exciton manifold as an effective TLS in\nthe timescale of interest.\nDetection The last two pulses provide an indirect QST of the state af-\n\nter the waiting time. The third perturbation along +k3 and centered\nat time t3 will selectively probe certain coherences and populations\n,\u03c92\nof \u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(T ). As an illustration (see Fig. 2e,f), the component of the\n2\npulse matching the transition energy \u03c9\u03b1g = \u03c9f \u03b2 and proportional\nto C\u03c9\u03b13 will, in the RWA, promote the resonant transitions |gi \u2192 |\u03b1i\nand |\u03b2i \u2192 |f i on the ket side, and the conjugate resonant transitions\nh\u03b1| \u2192 hg| and hf | \u2192 h\u03b2| on the bra side, the latter of which are\nirrelevant as we are ignoring transfers to the biexciton state during\nthe waiting time. These transitions will generate two sets of optically active coherences in the echo interval: \u03b1g, f \u03b2 which oscillate\nat frequency \u03c9\u03b1g , and \u03b2g, f \u03b1 which oscillate at \u03c9\u03b2g . These sets\ngenerate a polarization which interferes with the LO yielding signals proportional to C\u03c9\u03b14 and C\u03c9\u03b24 , respectively. The propagator for\nthe echo time is taken to be as in Eq. 11. A similar analysis can\nbe repeated for the C\u03c9\u03b23 term. Analogously to the preparation stage,\nthe same toolbox of two different waveforms for the third and the\n,\u03c92\nfourth pulses allows discrimination of all final states of \u03c1\u0303e\u03c911,e\n(T ).\n2\nFig. 2 depicts double-sided Feynman diagrams for all possible combinations of preparations and detections with four pulses each chosen\nfrom two waveforms, yielding sixteen experiments.

(13), with fixed polarizations ei , Eq. (14) can\nbe inverted to yield the elements of \u03c7(T ) associated with the singleexciton manifold of the dimer, hence accomplishing the desired QSTs\nand QPT at once (see Table 1). Notice that in principle, for a given\nvalue of waiting time T , the one-dimensional (1D) measurements associated with a single set of \u03c4, t values is enough for purposes of QPT\nof the single exciton manifold. In the most typical measurements, the\nsample has isotropically distributed chromophores, so Eq. 14 must\nbe modified to include isotropic averaging h*iiso (SI-VI). Since the\npresent QPT protocol does not rely on different polarization settings,\nwe will assume for simplicity that each of the sixteen experiments\nis carried out with (e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 ) = (z, z, z, z). Further technical\ndetails of the QPT protocol can be found in the next section as well\nas in SI-V\u2013XII.\nImportant observations (a) Difference between a standard PE experiment and QPT. In the current practice of NLOS, model Hamiltonians with free parameters for the excitonic system, the bath, and\nthe interaction between them are postulated, and the experimental\nspectra are fit to the model via calculation of response functions,\nfrom which structural and dynamical information is extracted [22]. In\nour language, such experiments involve fitting models to complicated\ncombinations of quantum processes associated with \u03c7(T ). QPT requires only a model for the excitonic system, but not for the bath\nor the system-bath coupling, making it suitable for probing systems\nwhere the bath dynamics are unknown. By definition, QPT extracts\nthe elements of \u03c7(T ), allowing a straightforward analysis of processes directly associated with the density matrix, such as dephasing\nand relaxation.\n(b) QPT can also be performed with control of time delays\n\u03c4 , t instead of frequency control.\nAlthough 1D measurements\nsuffice for QPT, suppose the signal is collected for many values of\n\u03c4 and t. Upon appropriately defined Fourier transformations of the\nsignal along these variables, a two-dimensional electronic spectrum\n(2D-ES) can be constructed where the coherence propagators of Eq.\n(11) manifest as four resonances about \u03c9\u03b1g and \u03c9\u03b2g along both axes\n4\n\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0709640104\n\n[8, 23, 20]. An important observation follows: the frequencies of the\ncoherent evolutions in the coherence and echo times are the same as\nthe frequencies of the first transition and the LO detection. By varying t and \u03c4 , a 2D-ES provides the frequency-controlled information\nof the first and fourth pulses. Hence, it is possible to make the first\nand fourth pulses sufficiently broadband that their frequency components at the \u03b1g and \u03b2g transitions are of similar magnitude. Then,\nthe sixteen 1D experiments can be replaced with four 2D-ES where\nthe second and third pulses are frequency controlled. A caveat in this\nidentification is the assumption that the optical coherences evolve in\na form like Eq. 11, without errors of coherence transfers (SI-VII,IX).\n(c) Extension to overlapping pulses. The discussion above\nassumed negligible pulse overlaps. Remarkably, Eqs. (14), (15) and\n(16) still hold in general for any \u03c4, t \u2265 0 and T > 3\u03c3, with the\nexception that C\u03c9r 3 C\u03c9s 4 in Eq. 14 must be replaced by\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ni(\u03c93 \u2212 \u03c9rg + \u03c94 \u2212 \u03c9sg )\u03c3\nt\n1\n+\n1 + Erf\nC\u03c9r 3 C\u03c9s 4\n2\n2\u03c3\n2\n[ 17 ]\nto account for the fact that the third pulse must act in the sample\nbefore the LO can detect the polarization (SI-IV-B). In the case of\nwell-separated pulses, t \u226b \u03c3, Eq. 17 reduces to C\u03c9r 3 C\u03c9s 4 .\nThe measurements of the real and imaginary part of the PE signal in the \u03c4, t = 0 limit are recognized with the names of transient\ndichroism (TD) and transient birefringence (TB), respectively [24],\nand are very interesting for QPT. For resonant TD/TB (\u03c93 + \u03c94 =\n\u03c9rs + \u03c9sg ), Eq. (17) reduces to 12 C\u03c9r 3 C\u03c9s 4 , which shows that the\nLO monitors only half of the original polarization since it interferes\nwith the polarization as it is generated. Consider such a resonant\nTD/TB experiment where, even though the pulses can achieve frequency selectivity, they are short in the sense that \u03c3 \u226a \u03bb1 , where \u03bb\nis a characteristic reorganization energy scale of the bath. In this situation, the bath state will not evolve during the action of the first\ntwo pulses, allowing unambiguous preparation of initial excitonic\nstates tensored with the same initial equilibrium bath configuration\n(SI-VIII), yielding a consistent QPT. Also, for \u03c4, t = 0, the free evolution of the optical coherences does not contribute to the signal, and\nthe short timescale \u03c3 does not allow for errors of population or coherence transfers to occur in the preparation or detection stages. Hence,\na highlight of the TD/TB signal is that it is determined exclusively\nby the dynamics of the single-exciton manifold. Scenarios where the\nTD/TB configuration is preferred compared to the PE are excitonic\nsystems coupled to highly non-Markovian baths [25, 26, 27, 28].\n(d) Numerical stability of QPT. An investigation of the stability properties of the matrices associated with the reconstruction of\n\u03c7(T ) from the sixteen enumerated experiments shows that our protocol is very robust upon the variation of the structural parameters of\nthe system, namely, the ratio between the two dipole norms dB /dA ,\nthe angle between the site dipoles \u03c6, and the mixing angle \u03b8. General exceptions occur at the vicinity of \u03b8 = 0, \u03c02 where the coupling\nJ vanishes, as well as for \u03b8 = \u03c04 , 3\u03c0\nand dB /dA = 1, that is, the\n4\nhomodimer case (SI-XI-A and B).\nNumerical example To test the extraction of \u03c7 from experimental\nspectra, we consider a dimer with Hamiltonian parameters that are on\nthe order of previously reported experiments consisting of light harvesting systems [29, 18] (\u03c9A = 12881 cm\u22121 , \u03c9B = 12719 cm\u22121 ,\nJ = 120 cm\u22121 , yielding \u03b8 = 0.49). We assume a toolbox of two\ncarrier frequencies \u03c9+ = 13480 cm\u22121 and \u03c9\u2212 = 12130 cm\u22121 ,\n\u03c9 ,\u03c9 ,\u03c9 ,\u03c9\n\n3\nBy comparing Eqs. 7 and 14, we notice that both [SP E ]e11,e22,e33,e44 (\u03c4, T, t) and\nP p,q,r,s\ne ,e ,e ,e (\u03c4, T, t) are related to iP P E via a real proportionality constant. Although\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nwe shall denote P p,q,r,s\ne1 ,e2 ,e3 ,e4 (\u03c4, T, t) loosely as a polarization, when referring to its real\nand imaginary parts, we must remember that they are proportional to the real and imaginary\n\u03c9 ,\u03c9 ,\u03c9 ,\u03c9\nparts of the signal [SP E ]e11,e22,e33,e44 (\u03c4, T, t), and to the imaginary and real parts of the\nactual polarization P P E , respectively.\n\nFootline Author\n\n\frespectively, so that \u03c9i \u2208 {\u03c9+ , \u03c9\u2212 } for all i, and the width of the\npulses to be F W HM = 28.3 fs in intensity, which corresponds to\n\u03c3 = 40 fs in amplitude. The parameters satisfy the MDC condition\nwith C \u2032 /C \u2032\u2032 = 20. The pulses are long enough to guarantee the selectivity of the produced exciton, but short enough to allow for the\nevolution of the bath induced excitonic dynamics to be monitored.\nWe choose dB /dA = 2 and \u03c6 = 0.3. We present simulations on\nthe QPT for this system, where each chromophore is linearly coupled to an independent Markovian bath of harmonic oscillators. The\ndissipative effects are modeled through a secular Redfield model at\ntemperature T = 273 K (SI-X).\nSince we are working in the MDC regime, the signals in Eq. 14\nare simply proportional to hP p,q,r,s\ne1 ,e2 ,e3 ,e4 (\u03c4, T, t)iiso . Fig. 3 plots\nthe sixteen real and imaginary parts of the hP p,q,r,s\nz,z,z,z (0, T, 0)iiso values, which can be regarded as signals from the TD/TB setting, or as\nPE signals with the coherence and echo time propagators factored\nout. They have been calculated via an isotropic average of Eqs. (15)\nand (16) (SI-VI,XI-B). In our simulations, we consider an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of 10,000 dimers with diagonal disorder. The site energies are drawn from Gaussian distributions centered about \u03c9A and \u03c9B , respectively, both with standard deviation of\n\u03c3inh = 40 cm\u22121 . For every waiting time T , the signal is calculated\nwith this fixed ensemble. After a normalization step, the signals are\nof O(1) or smaller. Additional noise simulating experimental errors\ndue to laser fluctuations is included. This consists of independent realizations at every waiting time T of Gaussian noise on the measured\nsignals with zero mean and \u03c3laser = 0.05 standard deviation.\nFig. 3 plots the ideal and inhomogeneously broadened, noisy signals as continuous and discrete points, respectively. The ideal signals\nare calculated from a single dimer with no disorder and without laser\nfluctuations. All plots start at T = 3\u03c3 = 51 fs, since for earlier\ntimes, the initial states are not yet effectively prepared. Errors in\np,q,r,s\nexperimental signals hP z,z,z,z\n(0, T, 0)iiso translate into errors of reconstructed \u03c7(T ). An estimate of the amplification of relative errors\nis set by the condition numbers of the matrices to be inverted, which\nis lower than \u03ba = 2.9 for our set of parameters dB /dA , \u03b8, \u03c6 (SI-XIB). Reconstruction of \u03c7 must respect the known symmetries, Eqs.\n2-4. Eqs. 2-3 are built into the corresponding matrix equations, but\nEq. (4) must be included by using a semidefinite programming routine. The latter is implemented using the open-source package CVX\n[30], and the result is Fig. 4, which shows the discrete points representing the reconstructed elements of \u03c7(T ) from noisy data on top\nof the ideal results plotted as continuous functions of T . The relative\nerror of the inverted \u03c7(T ) averages to 0.12. Notice that despite the\nsignificant inhomogeneous broadening and noise, there is remarkable\nagreement between the ideal and the reconstructed values. This finding is reminiscent of studies due to Humble and Cina [31].\nFig. 4 illustrates the final objective of a coupled dimer QPT,\nnamely, the process matrix \u03c7(T ). Each panel shows processes of\nthe density matrix as a function of T , conditional on the initial state\nbeing \u03b1\u03b1 (a), \u03b2\u03b2 (b), or \u03b1\u03b2 (c and d), with the ideal T -dependence.\nThe detailed balance condition in the Redfield model implies that\n\u03c7\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1 = \u03c7\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2 e\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 /kB T , which can be seen in panels (a) and\n(b). Also, note that due to the secular approximation, coherence-topopulation and the reverse processes are zero. Note that all the decoherence processes in our model occur within a timescale of hundreds\nof femtoseconds, with the \u03b1\u03b2 coherence evolving through about three\nperiods before practically vanishing (c and d).\nClearly, a more complex interplay of the excitonic system with\nthe phonon bath is possible [32], but this example illustrates the\nessence of the type of information which can be obtained through\nQPT.\nConclusions\nIn this article, we have introduced QPT as a powerful tool to systematically characterize the dynamics of excitonic systems in condensed\nphases. We identified the coherence, waiting, and echo intervals of\nthe PE experiment with the state preparation, free evolution, and deFootline Author\n\ntection stages of a QPT. In order to achieve selective state preparation\nand detection, we suggested frequency control through pulses of two\ndifferent colors, although scenarios with time delays and pulse polarizations as control knobs were also discussed here and elsewhere\n[33, 20]. By choosing between these colors for each of the four\npulses, sixteen experiments can be carried out, which yield all the\nelements of \u03c7(T ) related to the single-exciton manifold. An analysis of the reconstruction of \u03c7(T ) in the presence of inhomogeneous\nbroadening and experimental noise was provided, and the simulation\non a model system shows that QPT of an excitonic system in condensed phase is a very plausible goal.\nEquipped with \u03c7(T ), which completely characterizes the excitonic dynamics, a plethora of questions can be rigorously answered\nabout it. Some examples are: Can the bath be described as Markovian? If so, does the secular approximation hold, or can a population\nspontaneously be transferred to a coherence? [34] If not, what is its\ndegree of non-Markovianity? [35, 36] Does a given master equation accurately describe the dynamics of the system? What is the\ntimescale of each decoherence process? Are the baths coupled to\neach chromophore correlated? [37, 38] How much entanglement is\ninduced in the system upon photoexcitation? [39] Once these questions are answered, interesting questions of control [40] and manipulation of excitons can be asked.\nIn summary, a QIP approach to nonlinear spectroscopy via QPT\noffers novel insights on the ways to design experiments in order to\nextract information about the quantum state of the energy transfer\nsystem. We believe this work bridges a gap between theoretical and\nexperimental studies on excitation energy transfer from the QIP and\nphysical chemistry communities, respectively.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
