Several characteristic pattern\nstructures are distinguished depending on value of the evolution time. Transformation\nof Talbot \"collapse-revival\" behavior to Fraunhofer interference fringes is studied in\ndetail.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe interference measurements [1, 2] on two expanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\nhave created new important field of research where the density profile of gas, imaged after\nreleasing from the trap, provides important information about the phase of the groundstate wave function. Expansion of coherent arrays of BECs provides new opportunities\nto test the phase properties of the system [3]\u2013[6]. For example, Fraunhofer interference\npatterns observed in [4] demonstrate strong coherence of BECs confined in separate traps,\nand experiment [6] shows that this coherence can be manipulated by means of collapses and\nrevivals of wave functions due to nonlinear interaction of BECs in tightly confined states\nformed by three-dimensional periodic trapping potential.\nIt is well known (see, e.g., [7]) that mentioned above \"collapse-revival\" behavior of\nquantum-mechanical wave functions [8, 9] is a temporal counterpart of optical Talbot effect [10, 11] in which interference pattern behind the grating restores at distances multiple\nof the so-called Talbot distance d2 /\u03bb (d is the slit spacing in the grating and \u03bb is the wavelength of light). Similar Talbot effect was also observed in atom optics [12, 13]. Analogy\nbetween spatial Talbot effect and temporal collapse-revival behavior of wave functions suggests that such collapses-revivals should exist in interference of matter waves emitted from\n1\n\n\farrays of BECs provided evolution time is small enough, and indeed such effect was observed\nin [14]. In this connection it is natural to ask how this short-time Talbot behavior evolves\nfor finite array of condensates to long-time Fraunhofer behavior observed in [4]. This paper\nis devoted to consideration of this problem.\nIn Section 2 we present general formulas for the wave function produced by a linear\narray of BECs. We confine ourselves with one-dimensional theory under supposition that\ncondensate remains confined in radial direction after turning off a periodic optical potential\nand evolution takes place only along the axial direction of the BECs array. This formulas\npermit us to distinguish characteristic stages of evolution-short-time Talbot stage with\nrevivals of the wave function in the central part of the array, intermediate time stage when\nFraunhofer fringes already formed with Fresnel diffraction pattern inside each of them, and\nlong-time Fraunhofer stage with standard density distribution along fringes. These stages of\nevolution of the wave function are studied in detail in Section 3 (Talbot stage) and Section\n4 (transition to Fraunhofer stage). The last Section 5 is devoted to conclusions.\n\n2\n\nGeneral formulas\n\nAfter switching off the periodic optical potential the condensate density decreases and under\ncondition that the initial size \u223c \u03c3 of each BEC is much less than the spacing d between sites,\nthe interatomic interaction can be neglected during most time of the evolution and, hence,\nthe wave function obeys the linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ni~\u03c8t = \u2212\n\n~2\n\u03c8xx .\n2m\n\nIf the initial state is given by \u03c8(x, 0) = \u03c80 (x), then after time t it evolves into\nZ \u221e\n\u03c8(x, t) =\nG(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t)\u03c80 (x\u2032 )dx\u2032 ,\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere G(x \u2212 x\u2032 , t) is well-known Green function of Eq. (1) (see, e.g. [15]):\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\nm\nim(x \u2212 x\u2032 )2\n\u2032\nG(x \u2212 x , t) =\n.\nexp\n2\u03c0i~t\n2~t\n\n(3)\n\nTo simplify calculations, we suppose that the initial wave function of BEC in the site of the\narray with the coordinate kd can be approximated by a Gaussian function and, hence, we\nrepresent the initial state of BEC as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n1\n(x \u2212 kd)2\ni\u03c6k\n,\n(4)\n\u03c8(x, 0) = 1/4 \u221a\nAk e exp \u2212\n\u03c0\n\u03c3 k\n2\u03c3 2\nwhere Nk = |Ak |2 is equal to number of atoms in kth condensate (we suppose that \u03c3 \u226a d)\nand \u03c6k is its phase. Then Eq. (2) yields the solution\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n1\n(x \u2212 kd)2\ni\u03c6k\np\n\u03c8(x, t) =\nAk e exp \u2212 2\n.\n(5)\n2\u03c3 (1 + i~t/m\u03c3 2 )\n\u03c0 1/4 \u03c3(1 + i~t/m\u03c3 2 ) k\n2\n\n\fThis formula should be specified in accordance with the problem under consideration. In the\ncase of large number of condensates in the array confined in axial direction by a parabolic\npotential, the Thomas-Fermi approximation can be used for calculation of number of atoms\nin kth condensate which gives [4]:\n\u0012\n\u00132\nk2\n15N\n2\n1\u2212 2\n,\n(6)\nNk = Ak =\n16kM\nkM\nwhere\nkM =\n\ns\n\n2~\u03c9\u0304\nm\u03c9x2 d2\n\n\u0012\n\n15\na d\n\u221a N\n8 \u03c0 aho \u03c3\n\n\u00131/5\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nP\n2 1/3\nN =\nNk is the total number p\nof atoms, \u03c9\u0304 = (\u03c9x \u03c9\u22a5\n)\nis the geometric mean of the\nmagnetic trap frequencies, aho = ~/m\u03c9\u0304 is the corresponding oscillator length, and a > 0\nis the s-wave scattering length.\nIn the experiment [4] there was kM \u223c\n= 102 \u226b 1, and this large parameter suggests that\nthere are different stages of evolution.\nFor\nmd2\nt\u226a\n(8)\n~\neach condensate evolves independently of each other and there is no their interference effects.\nFor\nmd2\nmd2\nt\u223c\n\u226a kM *\n(9)\n~\n~\nwe have interference between condensates, but in the central part of the array the influence\nof its finite size is negligibly small and local interference pattern can be approximated by\nthat of an infinite periodic lattice of condensates which leads to temporal Talbot effect.\nFor\nmd2\nmd2\n2\nkM *\n\u226a t \u226a kM\n*\n(10)\n~\n~\nthe Fraunhofer fringes begin to form. Indeed, their positions are given by (see, e.g., [4])\n2\u03c0~\nt,\nxn (t) \u223c\n= \u00b1n\ndm\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n\n(11)\n\nand if t satisfies the condition (10), then distances between neighboring fringes \u223c 2\u03c0~t/md\nare much greater than the size of each fringe \u223c 2kM d (see below). At the same time, the\ninterference pattern inside each fringe is formed by only some part of the array and hence\nwe get Fresnel diffraction pattern along the fringe.\nAt last, for\nmd2\n2\nt \u226b kM\n*\n(12)\n~\nwe arrive at usual Fraunhofer diffraction when the whole array contributes into interference\npattern inside each fringe.\nTo illustrate these stages of evolution of the wave function, we have shown in Fig. 1 the\ndistributions of density \u03c1 = |\u03c8|2 calculated from formulas (5)\u2013(7) with \u03c6k = 0 (coherent condensates).

We see that at t equal\nto multiple of Talbot time tr , t = ntr , all phase factors in (25) become equal to unity and\n(25) reduces to the Fourier series for the initial periodic wave function (24). This method of\nderivation of time-periodicity of the wave function shows that periodic restoration of the initial state is not a specific feature of the initial state (24) built of Gaussian functions. Indeed,\nany periodic initial function can be expanded into Fourier series and harmonics cos(2\u03c0xk/d),\n2 ~t\nk = 1, 2, . . . , evolve with time according to factors exp(\u2212i 2\u03c0\nk 2 ) which become equal to\nmd2\nunity at t = ntr . Thus, any periodic initial wave function completely restores periodically\nits form. The described above picture of periodic in time changes of the interference pattern\nis shown in Fig. 2 where even for relatively small number of condensates first several revivals\nare clearly seen.\n6\n\n\fThe above theory can be generalized on non-zero phases in the initial state and hence in\nthe solution (2). For example, in the case of alternating phases of condensates,\nei\u03c6k = (\u22121)k ,\nthe wave function can be expressed in terms of \u03b84 -function [16],\nr\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx\n\u03c0 1/4 A 2\u03c3i\ni\u03c0x2\n1\n\u03c8(x, t) =\n\u03b84\n,\nexp \u2212 2\n,\u2212\nd\n\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\u03c4\nor, with the use of the transformation formula [16],\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u221a\ni\u03c0z 2\nz\n1\n\u03b84\n= \u2212i\u03c4 exp\n\u03b82 (z, \u03c4 ),\n,\u2212\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nin the form\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c0\u03c3 A \u0010 x \u0011\n\u03b82\n,\u03c4 .\n(29)\n\u03c0 1/4 d\nd\nThen the property \u03b82 (z, \u03c4 + 1) = exp(\u03c0i/4)\u03b82 (z, \u03c4 ) leads to restoration of the initial state\n(up to inessential constant phase factor) after revival time\n\u03c8(x, t) =\n\ntr =\n\nmd2\n1 2\u03c0~\n= *\n.\n2\u03c0~\n8 ER\n\n(30)\n\nLet us estimate an order of magnitude of the revival time for arrays of BECs. In the\ncase [6] of 87 Rb BECs array loaded into optical potential with light wavelength \u03bb = 838 nm\nformula (21) gives tr \u2243 75 \u03bcs. This is about one order of magnitude less than the revival time,\ncaused by nonlinear interaction, of single condensate in the experiment [6]. In this experiment\nabsorption images were taken after a time-of-flight period of 16 ms which is much greater\n(with factor \u223c 200) than our estimate of tr . For number of sites in 3D lattice \u223c 103 we have\nkM \u223c 10 and, hence, the observed interference patterns correspond to the Fraunhofer limit\n(12). In this case the difference of interference patterns was caused by difference in initial\nstates of condensates at different \"hold times\" of evolution of each condensate in strongly\nconfined states formed by 3D periodic trapping potential.\nIn the experiment [4] the revival time is tr \u2243 69 \u03bcs and a typical image was taken at\nt = 29 ms, that is for kM \u223c 100 again in the Fraunhofer limit (in accordance with the theory\ndeveloped in this paper).\n\n4\n\nTransition to Fraunhofer interference\n\nNow we shall turn to the regions (10) and (12). Effects of Fresnel diffraction can be noticed\nin Fig. 1 for t = 10tr . However, they are not expressed clearly enough because of smooth distribution (6) of density in the array used in our calculations. Therefore it is more instructive\nto consider finite array with equal amplitudes Ak = 1 of wave functions in each condensate\nand take \u03c6k = \u2206\u03c6 * k, that is with equal differences \u2206\u03c6 of phases between neighboring\ncondensates. Then Eq.

Thus,\nthe wave function in vicinity of the nth fringe is given by\n\"\nr\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n1\n2\u03c0 2 \u03c3 2\nm\u03c3 imx2\n\u2206\u03c6\n\u03c8n (x, t) = 1/4\n\u03a6(\u03b4, t),\n(35)\nn+\ne 2~t * exp \u2212 2\n\u03c0\ni~t\nd\n2\u03c0\nwhere \u03b4 = x \u2212 xn .

Formation of the\nFresnel pattern is clearly seen.\nThis formula reduces to Eq. (6) of Ref. [4] for \u2206\u03c6 = 0.\nDependence on \u03b4 determines fine interference pattern inside fringes. It is expressed by\nthe factor in curly brackets and demonstrates typical Fresnel form (see, e.g., [15], section\n3.3, or [19], section 8.7) of diffraction from a slit with width 2kM d equal to the whole array\nlength. Accuracy of this analytical description depends on the number of sites in the array\nand increases with growth of kM . In Fig. 3 it is shown how exact profile of density along\nthe fringe changes with increase of kM . Its transformation into Fresnel diffraction pattern is\nclearly seen. Small \"ripples\" are obviously caused by the discrete structure of the array.\nFor larger values of time (12) Fresnel structure evolves into usual form of density distribution in Fraunhofer diffraction from finite slit with width 2kM d.

It shows that the interference pattern exhibits\nquite complicated evolution with time from Talbot \"collapses and revivals\" of wave function\nthrough intermediate region of Fraunhofer fringes with Fresnel patterns inside them, and,\neventually, to standard Fraunhofer diffraction from finite grating. One may suppose that\ntechnique of density imaging will permit one to study experimentally all these stages.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by FAPESP (Brazil) and CNPq (Brazil).
