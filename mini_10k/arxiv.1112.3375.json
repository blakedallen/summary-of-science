Infrared divergences of massless gauge-theory scattering amplitudes\nThe problem of predicting the structure of infrared singularities of on-shell n-particles scattering amplitudes in massless QCD simplifies, if one realizes that they can be put in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with UV divergences of operators defined in soft-collinear effective field theory\n(SCET) [1, 2, 3].\nThis idea implies that infrared divergences can be studied by means of standard renormalizationgroup techniques. The IR divergences of n-point scattering amplitudes can be absorbed into a multiplicative renormalization factor Z, which is related to an anomalous dimension \u0393. The Z-factor\nand the anomalous dimension \u0393 are matrices in color space, i.e. they mix amplitudes with the same\nparticle content but different color structure.\nThe predictive power of this approach relies on the fact that the anomalous dimension \u0393 is\nstrictly constrained by the structure of the effective field theory, as well as by other elements, like\nthe non-abelian exponentiation theorem and the two parton collinear limit. In [1, 2, 3] a form of\nthe anomalous dimension \u0393 compatible with all these constraints has been derived, whose central\nfeature is that only pairwise correlations among charges and momenta of different partons are\nallowed. Using the color-space formalism it explicitly reads\n\u0393({p}, \u03bc ) =\n\nTi * T j\n\u03bc2\n(\n)\nln\n\u03b3\n\u03b1\n\u2211 2 cusp s \u2212si j + \u2211 \u03b3 i(\u03b1s ),\ni\n(i, j)\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere si j \u2261 2\u03c3i j pi * p j + i0, and the sign factor \u03c3i j = +1 if the momenta pi and p j are both incoming\nor outgoing, and \u03c3i j = \u22121 otherwise. The sum runs over the n external partons, and we refer to [3]\nfor further detail.\nOne of the major statements of [1, 2, 3] is that the conjecture (1.1) should hold to all orders\nin perturbation theory. If true, this is an intriguing result, because it implies a semi-classical origin\nof IR singularities, and it allows to shed new light on the deeper structure of the strong interaction.\nFor instance, an interesting consequence is the prediction that the cusp anomalous dimension of\nquarks and gluons should be equal to the quadratic Casimir operator CR in the fundamental or\nadjoint representation times a universal coefficients. In other words, the cusp anomalous dimension\nof quarks and gluons should obey Casimir scaling to all orders in perturbation theory. Such a\nprediction is highly non-trivial, because it is expected not to hold anymore at the non-perturbative\nlevel, which is supported by recent investigations based on the AdS/CFT correspondence [7, 8, 9].\nThe validity of (1.1) was studied explicitly to three-loop order by means of a diagrammatic\nanalysis, [3, 4]. It was found that only one new color structure can arise, at three loop, which has to\ndepend on the momenta of four external partons. In order to be consistent with all the constraints,\nhowever, the corresponding coefficient function, which encode the momentum dependence, must\nbe highly nontrivial, as it must vanish in all collinear limits. Explicitly the additional term reads\n\u2206\u0393({p}, \u03bc ) =\n\n\u2211\n\nf ade f bce T ai T bj T ck T dl F(\u03b2i jkl , \u03b2ikl j \u2212 \u03b2il jk ),\n\n(1.2)\n\n(i, j,k,l)\n(\u2212s )(\u2212s )\n\nwhere \u03b2ikl j = ln (\u2212siikj )(\u2212skljl ) is the logarithm of the conformal cross ratio. An example of such\na function [4] is F(x, y) = x3 (x2 \u2212 y2 ), but it was recently excluded using additional constraints\nobtained exploiting the high-energy Regge limit of the anomalous dimension \u0393 [5, 6].\n2\n\n\fAnomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators\n\nLeonardo Vernazza\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Gluon webs contributing to the soft anomalous dimension matrix at four loops.\n\nIn this talk we report about work in progress [15]. We extend the diagrammatic analysis [3]\nto four loops in perturbation theory, in order to look for new color structures which could arise and\nbreak the simple structure of the anomalous dimension (1.1). In particular, we look for new terms\nwhich could lead to a violation of the Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension of quarks\nand gluons. We refer to [15] for further details.\n\n2. Diagrammatic analysis at four loops\nThe correspondence between infrared singularities of gauge scattering amplitudes and UV\npoles of matrix elements of SCET operators can be seen by considering off-shell n-parton Green's\nfunction with large momentum transfer si j = (pi \u00b1 p j )2 and small off-shellness p2i \u226a si j . In the\neffective theory these Green's functions are represented by the matrix element of UV renormalized\nn-jet operators:\nren\nGn ({p}) = lim \u2211 Cn,i (\u03bc )hOn,i\n(\u03bc )i = lim \u2211 Cn,i (\u03bc )Zi j (\u03bc , \u03b5 )hOn,bare\nj (\u03b5 )i.\n\n\u03b5 \u21920 i\n\n\u03b5 \u21920 i, j\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn the second identity we have written explicitly the renormalization factor Z of the bare SCET\noperators. To obtain on-shell n-parton scattering amplitudes one takes the limit p2i \u2192 0. In this way,\non the one hand infrared divergences are introduced in the Green's function, which are regularized\nin d = 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 . On the other, the matrix elements of the bare operators become trivial, because\nthe collinear and soft scale are set to zero, and all loops integrals in the effective theory become\nscaleless and vanish. The n-parton scattering amplitude free of infrared divergences is therefore\nequal to the Wilson coefficient Cn ,\nCn,i ({p}, \u03bc ) = lim \u2211 Z \u22121\n\u03b5 \u21920 i, j\n\n\u0001\n\nij\n\nGn, j (\u03b5 {p}),\n\n(2.2)\n\ntimes trivial color and Dirac structures from the operator matrix element. The logarithm of the\nrenormalization factor Z is related via \u0393 = \u2212d ln Z/d ln \u03bc to the anomalous dimension matrix\n\u0393 governing the RG evolution equation of the n-jet SCET operators Onren . \u0393 = \u0393c+s is determined by the collinear and soft modes, and collinear-soft factorization assures that \u0393c+s = \u0393s +\n\u2211i \u0393ic . The collinear anomalous dimension is known, \u0393ic = \u2212\u0393icusp Li + \u03b3ci , where Li = ln \u03bc 2 /p2i is a\ncollinear logarithm, therefore the conjecture (1.1) becomes a prediction for \u0393s , with the constraint\n3\n\n\fAnomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators\n\nLeonardo Vernazza\n\n\u2202 \u0393s (\u03bc )/\u2202 Li = \u0393cusp\n. This important constraint originates from the requirement that collinear logi\narithms must cancel between \u0393s and \u2211i \u0393ic , in order to match the dependence on the hard scale\nalone in \u0393 = \u0393c+s . As a consequence, the conjecture (1.1) can be proven order by order based\non a diagrammatic analysis of the anomalous dimension of the soft function. The latter is given\nby the vacuum expectation value of n soft Wilson lines. The non-abelian exponentiation theorem\nguarantees that the corresponding anomalous dimension receives contributions only from singleconnected gluon webs attached to the n Wilson lines of the soft operator. An additional constraint\ncomes from the two-parton collinear limit: when two partons become collinear, a n-parton amplitude splits into a (n \u2212 1)-amplitude times a splitting function. One finds that the anomalous\ndimension of the splitting function can only depend on the color and momenta of the two collinear\npartons.\nUsing all these results, new structures contributing to the anomalous dimension can arise at\nfour loops, which are related to the webs in Fig. 1. The webs in (a) are proportional to higher\nCasimir invariants. The possibility of having new structures of this type, linear in the cusp angle,\n\u03b2i j \u2261 ln \u03bc 2 /p2i + ln \u03bc 2 /p2j \u2212 ln \u03bc 2 /(\u2212si j ), has been already excluded [3]. Here we focus on structures which have a different momentum dependence, such as a dependence on the logarithm of\nthe conformal cross ratio defined above. We find that the following structures are compatible with\nconstraints from the soft-collinear factorization:\n\u2206\u0393 =\n\n\u2211 [Dii j j g4 (\u03b1s ) + Diiii g5 (\u03b1s )] + \u2211\n\n(i, j)\n\nDi jkl G1 (\u03b2i jkl , \u03b2ikl j \u2212 \u03b2il jk ),\n\n(2.3)\n\n(i, j,k,l)\n\nwhere G1 (x, y) = G1 (\u2212x, y) has to be even in its first argument to match the symmetries of Di jkl =\n\u0001\ndFabcd T ai T bj T ck T dl + . Out of the terms proportional to g4 (\u03b1s ) and g5 (\u03b1s ), only the latter is compatible with the collinear constraint. However, since it does not have an explicit scale dependence,\nit would not affect the Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension. Considering then the\nterm proportional to G1 (x, y), we see that, similarly to the term proportional to F(x, y) in (1.2),\nits presence is compatible with the collinear limit only if G1 (x, y) vanishes in all two-particles\ncollinear limits. An explicit example is G1 (x, y) = x2 (x2 \u2212 y2 )2 , as found in [5] as well. However, we find that this example, too, is ruled out by the constraint from Reggeization. In the\nhigh energy limit, in fact, G1 (x, y) = x2 (x2 \u2212 y2 )2 contains terms proportional to ln(s/(\u2212t))4 . If\npresent, these leading logarithms (with the corresponding nontrivial color structure) would appear as an additional contribution to the Regge trajectories of gluons, which are known to NLL\n[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and those logarithms do not appear. Therefore, consistency with the Regge\nlimit rules out G1 (x, y) = x2 (x2 \u2212 y2 )2 . This of course does not exclude the existence of more\ncomplicated G1 (x, y), in which the leading and the next-to-leading logarithms cancel.\nThe webs in Fig.1(b) involve up to five external partons, and have the following color structure:\nTi jklm = \u2212T jilkm = \u2212Tkli jm = \u2212Tik jlm = \u2212Tl jkim = f adx f bcy f exy (T ai T bj T ck T dl T em )+ .\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe consider the contributions to the anomalous dimension compatible with the symmetries of this\nobject, and we look for those terms which satisfy soft-collinear factorization as well. We find:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2206\u0393 = \u2211 Tii jkk \u1e211 (\u03b1s ) \u03b2i j + \u1e212 (\u03b1s ) \u03b2 jk\n(i, j,k)\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nTi jklm G2 (\u03b2i jkm , \u03b2ikm j \u2212 \u03b2im jk , \u03b2i jml , \u03b2iml j \u2212 \u03b2il jm ) .\n\n(i, j,k,l,m)\n\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fAnomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators\n\nLeonardo Vernazza\n\nConsistency with the collinear limit eliminates the terms proportional to \u1e211 and \u1e212 . The last term\ninvolving a nontrivial function of the logarithms of the conformal cross ratios is possible only if the\nfunction G2 vanishes in all the collinear limits. Its presence would however not affect the Casimir\nscaling of the cusp anomalous dimension.\nIn conclusion, we have analyzed possible new contributions to the soft anomalous dimension\nof n-jet operators in SCET at four loop in perturbation theory. We find that the only new color\nstructures allowed would involve four partons, with momentum dependence encoded in functions\nof the logarithm of the conformal cross ratio. Those terms, however, would not affect the Casimir\nscaling of the cusp anomalous dimension of quarks and gluons.\nAknowledgments\nI thank the organizers of the conference for an exciting conference in a pleasant atmosphere,\nLi Lin Yang for comments on the manuscript and the Humboldt foundation for support.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
