We investigate the environment of the infrared dust bubble N65 and search for\nevidence of triggered star formation in its surroundings.\nMethods. We performed a multiwavelength study of the region around N65 with data\ntaken from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL,\nSCUBA, and GRS. We analyzed the distribution of the molecular gas and dust in the\nenvironment of N65 and performed infrared photometry and spectral analysis of point\nsources to search for young stellar objects and identify the ionizing star candidates.\nResults. We found a molecular cloud that appears to be fragmented into smaller clumps\nalong the N65 PDR. This indicates that the so-called collect and collapse process may\nbe occurring. Several young stellar objects are distributed among the molecular clumps.\nThey may represent a second generation of stars whose formation was triggered by the\nbubble expanding into the molecular gas. We identified O-type stars inside N65, which\nare the most reliable ionizing star candidates.\nKey words. ISM: HII regions \u2013 ISM: clouds \u2013 stars: formation\n\n1. Introduction\nSince the early work of Elmegreen & Lada (1977), it is known that during the supersonic\nexpansion of an HII region, a dense layer of material can be collected between the ionization\nand the shock fronts. This layer can be fragmented into massive condensations that may\nthen collapse to form new massive stars and/or clusters. Several observational studies have\ninferred that this process, known as \"collect and collapse\", triggers massive star formation\n(see e.g., Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009; Zavagno et al. 2007, and references therein). As Deharveng\net al. (2005) point out, only the presence of either a dense molecular shell surrounding the\nionized gas of an HII region or massive fragments regularly spaced along the ionization\nfront, can prove that we are dealing with the collect and collapse process.\nUsing Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) data,\nChurchwell et al. (2006, 2007) cataloged almost 600 infrared (IR) dust bubbles, full or\nSend offprint requests to: A. Petriella\n\nc ESO 2018\n\n\f2\n\nA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\npartial rings bordered by a photodissociation region (PDR) and detected mainly at 8 \u03bcm,\nwhich usually enclose ionized gas and hot dust observed at 24 \u03bcm. Most of these bubbles are\nHII regions and several have morphologies that are indicative of triggered star formation.\nOn the other hand, Cyganowski et al. (2008) also using GLIMPSE data, identified more\nthan 300 extended 4.5 \u03bcm sources, so-called \"extended green objects (EGOs)\", applying\nthe common coding of the [4.5] band as green in three-color composite Infrared Array\nCamera images. According to the authors, an EGO is probably a massive young stellar\nobject (MYSO) driving outflows. The extended emission in the 4.5 \u03bcm band is produced\nby H2 (\u03bd = 0\u20130, S(9,10,11)) lines and CO (\u03bd = 1 \u2212 0) band heads, which are excited by\nthe shock of the outflows propagating in the interstellar medium (ISM). The majority of\nEGOs are associated with infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and some lie over the border of\nIR dust bubbles.\nFrom the catalog of Churchwell et al. (2006), we select the IR dust bubble N65, which\nharbors the EGO G35.03+0.35 in one of its borders (indicative of active star formation),\nto study its environment.\nN65 is a complete (i.e., closed ring) IR dust bubble centered on \u03b12000 = 18h 54m02s ,\n\u03b42000 = +01\u25e6 59\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 (l = 35.\u25e6 000, b = +0.\u25e6 332) with a radius of about 2\u2032 .6 (Churchwell\net al. 2006). Close to N65, over one of its borders, centered on \u03b12000 = 18h 54m 04.2s ,\n\u03b42000 = +02\u25e601\u2032 33.9\u2032\u2032 (l = 35.\u25e6 035, b = +0.\u25e6 338) lies the IR source IRAS 18515+0157,\nwhere several molecular lines tracers of star formation were detected. Maser emission from\nH2 O and OH was detected by Forster & Caswell (1989), as well as methanol (Caswell\net al. 1995). Bronfman et al. (1996) and Jijina et al. (1999) also detected CS and NH3 ,\nrespectively. The detection of formaldehyde at vLSR \u223c 57 km s\u22121 was used by Watson\net al. (2003) to determine that this star-forming region lies at the kinematic distance of 10\nkpc, the farthest possible given the distance ambiguity of the first Galactic quadrant. On\nthe other hand, close to this region, at l = 35.\u25e6 015, b = +0.\u25e6 356 and also across the border\nof N65, Anderson et al. (2009) cataloged the UCHII region G35.02+0.35 with a velocity of\n\u223c 57.2 km s\u22121 , which they locate at the near distance of \u223c 3.6 kpc.\nIn this work, we present a molecular and IR study of the environment surrounding\nthe IR dust bubble N65 to explore its surrounding ISM and search for signatures of star\nformation. We describe the data used in Sect. 2, the results and the discussion of them are\npresented in Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 summarizes the results.\n\n2. Data\nWe analyzed data extracted from five large-scale surveys: the Two Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS)1 , Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE),\nMIPSGAL, GRS2 , and the SCUBA Legacy Catalogue. GLIMPSE is a mid-infrared survey\nof the inner Galaxy performed with the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\n3\n\nimages from GLIMPSE and the GLIMPSE Point-Source Catalog (GPSC) in the SpitzerIRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 \u03bcm). IRAC has an angular resolution of between 1.\u2032\u2032 5 and 1.\u2032\u2032 9\n(see Fazio et al. 2004 and Werner et al. 2004). MIPSGAL is a survey of the same region as\nGLIMPSE, using the MIPS instrument (24 and 70 \u03bcm) on Spitzer. The MIPSGAL resolution is 6\u2032\u2032 at 24 \u03bcm. The GRS is being performed by the Boston University and the Five\nCollege Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO). The survey maps the galactic Ring in\nthe 13 CO J=1\u20130 line with an angular and spectral resolution of 46\u2032\u2032 and 0.2 km s\u22121 , respectively (see Jackson et al. 2006). The observations were performed in both position-switching\nand on-the-fly mapping modes, achieving an angular sampling of 22\u2032\u2032 . The SCUBA Legacy\nCatalogues3 are two sets of continuum maps and catalogs using data at 450 and 850 \u03bcm\nobtained with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) with angular\nresolutions of 19\u2032\u2032 and 11\u2032\u2032 , respectively (Di Francesco et al. 2008).\n\n3. Results and discussion\nFigure 1 (left) shows a Spitzer-IRAC three color image of N65. The three IR bands are 3.6\n\u03bcm (in blue), 4.5 \u03bcm (in green), and 8 \u03bcm (in red). The location of the EGO G35.03+0.35\n(Cyganowski et al. 2008) is indicated. Figure 1 (right) displays a composite two-color image\ntowards N65. Red and green represent the Spitzer-IRAC emission at 8 \u03bcm and the SpitzerMIPSGAL emission at 24 \u03bcm, respectively. Both figures clearly show the PDR visible in the\n8 \u03bcm emission, which originates mainly in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\nThe PAH emission delineates the HII region boundaries because these large molecules are\ndestroyed inside the ionized region, but are excited in the PDR by the radiation leaking\nfrom the HII region (Pomar\u00e8s et al. 2009). The 24 \u03bcm emission, displayed in green in Fig.\n1 (right), corresponds to hot dust, distributed mainly towards the eastern border of N65\nthat coincides with the central position of IRAS 18515+0157.\n\nFig. 1.

Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\nFrom Fig. 1, a probably smaller IR dust bubble can be discerned in the southwest border\nof N65, centered on l = 34.\u25e6 96, b = +0.\u25e6 31, which is displayed in Fig. 2. The emission at\n8 \u03bcm (Fig. 2 left) shows an almost circular PDR, which encloses a region of about 18\u2032\u2032 in\ndiameter. At the center of the bubble, a source is visible with emission in the 3.5, 4.5, 8,\nand 24 \u03bcm bands, which is probably the exciting star of this structure surrounded by hot\ndust emitting at 24 \u03bcm (green in Fig. 2 right).\n\nFig. 2. Mid-IR emission of the possible smaller IR dust bubble that lies in the southwest border\nof N65.

Molecular and dust analysis\nWe inspected the molecular gas around N65 from the GRS data in the whole velocity range\nand found an interesting feature around v \u223c 50 km s\u22121 . Figure 3 shows the integrated\nvelocity maps of the\n\n13\n\nCO J=1-0 emission every 1.05 km s\u22121 between 47 and 56 km s\u22121 .\n\nThe circle shows the position and size of N65. A molecular cloud with an arc-like shape\nopen to the south is evident that encloses the IR bubble over one of its borders. The\nmolecular gas exhibits several clumps along the PDR. The distribution and morphology of\nthis material suggests that the collect and collapse process might be occurring.\nIn Fig. 4, we compare the\ns\n\n\u22121\n\n13\n\nCO emission integrated within the interval 47 and 55 km\n\nwith the continuum dust emission at 850 \u03bcm extracted from the SCUBA (in yellow\n\ncontours). In this figure, it is evident that the dust emission coincides with the brightest\nmolecular clump centered on l \u223c 35.\u25e6 02, b \u223c 0.\u25e6 35 and with the position of the EGO\nG35.03+0.35. The presence of the EGO together with all the previous results mentioned\nin Sect. 1 provide clear evidence that this region might be active in star formation.\nIf we assume that the molecular gas in the velocity range considered before is physically\nassociated with N65, we can adopt \u223c 50 km s\u22121 as the systemic velocity of the infrared dust\nbubble. According to the galactic rotation model of Fich et al. (1989) (with R\u2299 = 8.5 kpc\nand v\u2299 = 220 km s\u22121 ), we obtain kinematic distances of either 3.5 or 10.5 kpc. Considering\n\n\fA.

Thus, we assume a\ndistance of 3.5 kpc for N65, in coincidence with the UCHII region G35.02+0.35 cataloged\nby Anderson et al.

IR photometry\nWe analyze the distribution of IR point sources in the surroundings of N65 to search for\nsigns of star formation and try to identify the ionizing-star candidates. Figure 5 shows\nthe [5.8]-[8.0] versus [3.6]-[4.5] color-color (CC) diagram for the sources extracted from\nthe GLIMPSE Point Source Catalog in the Spitzer-IRAC bands within a circle of 8\u2032 in\nradius centered on l = 35.\u25e6 00, b = +0.\u25e6 32. The size of this region completely covers the\nextension of N65 and the surrounding molecular clumps, where stars may be forming. We\nonly consider sources with detection in the four bands. The regions in the figure indicate\n\n\fA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\n7\n\nthe stellar evolutionary stages based on the criteria of Allen et al. (2004): class I sources are\nprotostars with circumstellar envelopes, class II are disk-dominated objects, and class III\nare main sequence and giant stars. We search for ionizing star candidates among class III\nsources, while class I and II sources are chosen to be the YSO candidates. In the following\nsections, we report the results of these analyses.\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\nClass I\n\n[3.6]-[4.5]\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nClass II\n\nClass III\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n[5.8]-[8.0]\n\nFig. 5.

The regions indicate the stellar evolutionary stage as defined by Allen et al. (2004). Class\nI sources are protostar with circumstellar envelopes; class II are disk dominated objects; and class\nIII are main sequence and giant stars.\n\n3.3. Identifying the exciting star(s) of N65\nWe attempt identify or at least propose the possible exciting stars(s) of N65.\nAccording to Churchwell et al. (2006), IR dust bubbles may be produced by O- and/or\nB-type stars. Given that we do not find any cataloged massive star toward N65, we look\nfor the exciting star(s) among the class III sources because they include main sequence\nstars. The ionizing star(s) are not always located close to the geometrical center of the\nbubble because of their proper motion. However, we expect to find them inside the PDR\nas IR dust bubbles are young objects and the ionizing star(s) may not have enough time\nto overcome the shell. To perform near IR photometry using the 2MASS JHK bands, we\nselect class III objects within the N65 PDR that have detections in the aforementioned\nnear IR bands. Figure 6 shows the (H-K) versus (J-H) color-color (CC) diagram of the\n22 sources found using this criteria. Figure 7 shows the K versus (H-K) color-magnitude\n(CM) diagram. Finally, in Fig. 8 we show the location of these sources.\nTo identify possible exciting star(s) candidates among the 22 sources found, we select\nobjects that meet both of the following criteria simultaneously: (i) according to their posi-\n\n\f8\n\nA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\ntion in the CC diagram (Fig. 6), the sources may be main sequence stars and (ii) according\nto their position in the CM diagram (Fig. 7), the sources may be O- or B-type stars. These\nsources are indicated by red numbers in Figs. 6 and 7 and red crosses in Fig. 8.\n\n6\n\n5\n4\n2 17\n\n4\n\n19\n\n18\n\n3\n\n6\n\n7\n20\n\nJ-H\n\n13\n\n15\n\n22\n\n3\n1\n11\n\n2\n\nAv=20\n\n9\n21\n\n14\n\n8\n\n5\n10\n\n1\n\nAv=10\n\n16\n12\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nH-Ks\n\nFig. 6. (H-K) versus (J-H) color-color (CC) diagram of the class III objects within the N65 PDR.\nThe two solid curves represent the location of the main sequence (thin line) and the giant stars\n(thicker line) derived from Bessell & Brett (1988). The parallel dashed lines are reddening vectors.\nWe have assumed the interstellar reddening law of Rieke & Lebofsky (1985) (AJ /AV =0.282;\nAH /AV =0.175 and AK /AV =0.112). The sources with red numbers are the ones selected to be the\ncandidates for exciting stars of N65.\n\nAs an additional constraint of the ionizing star(s) candidate, we derive the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the selected sources by fitting the fluxes in the IRAC and\n2MASS bands with a Kurucz photospheric model using the tool developed by Robitaille\net al. (2007) and available online4 . The fitting tool requires a distance range and a range\nof visual extinction. We assume a distance of 3.5 kpc and derive the extinction for each\nsource from the 2MASS CC diagram (H-K) versus (J-H) presented in Fig. 6. Once the\nSED is obtained, we check whether the fitted effective temperature is consistent with the\ntemperature of an O- and B-type star. Our analysis is only qualitative because of the\nuncertainty in the determination of the spectral type from the CM diagram and because\nthe fitting photosphere model extends only to 50,000 K.\nThe fitted effective temperatures of stars 5, 10, and 16 obtained from the SED is \u223c\n6,000 K and for star 20 is \u223c 20,000 K. These values are too low for a O- or early B-type\nstar. For the remaining sources 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, and 21 the fitted temperature is \u223c\n50,000 K, which is in closer agreement with the effective temperature expected for an Otype star (see Schaerer & de Koter 1997). Thus, based on their position inside the bubble,\nwe suggest that sources 8, 12, and 15 are the most reliable ionizing-star candidates of N65.\n4\n\nhttp://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/protostars/\n\n\fA.

Star formation around N65\nFigure 9 shows the distribution of both class I (yellow crosses) and class II (magenta\ncrosses) point sources around N65. We note the presence of a group of these sources right\nupon the molecular clumps that surround the bubble above its PDR. As molecular clouds\nare star birth places, we expect some of these sources to be YSOs whose formation could\nhave been triggered by the expanding IR dust bubble.\nWe perform a fitting of the fluxes of YSO candidates in the IRAC and 2MASS bands, to\nderive their spectral energy distribution (SED) and constrain their evolutionary stage.

We show the distribution of class I (yellow\ncrosses) and class II (magenta crosses) sources around N65 derived from the CC diagram of Fig.\n5. We have labeled the sources located upon the molecular cloud and close to the PDR.\n\nlimit our study to the sources superimposed on the molecular cloud around N65 (see Fig.\n9). The SED was obtained using the tool developed by Robitaille et al. (2007) available\nonline5 . This tool consists of a grid of precomputed radiative transfer models with a fast\n\u03c72 minimization algorithm. We select the models that satisfied the condition\n\u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min < 2N,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c72min is the minimum value of the \u03c72 among all models, and N is the number of\ninput data fluxes (fluxes specified as upper limit do not contribute to N). Hereafter, we\nrefer to models satisfying Eq. (1) as \"selected models\".\nTo relate the SED to the evolutionary stage of the YSO, Robitaille et al. (2006) defined three different stages as a complementary classification of Allen's classes. The stage\nclassification is based on the values of the central source mass M\u22c6 , the disk mass Mdisk ,\nthe envelope mass Menv , and the envelope accretion rate \u1e40env of the YSO. Stage I YSOs\nare those that have \u1e40env /M\u22c6 > 10\u22126 yr\u22121 , i.e., protostars with large accretion envelopes;\nstage II are those with \u1e40disk /M\u22c6 > 10\u22126 yr\u22121 and \u1e40env /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 yr\u22121 , i.e., young\nobjects with prominent disks; and stage III are those with \u1e40disk /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 yr\u22121 and\n\u1e40env /M\u22c6 < 10\u22126 yr\u22121 , i.e., evolved sources where the flux is dominated by the central\nsource. The stage classification is based on the physical properties of the YSO, rather than\n5\n\nhttp://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/protostars/\n\n\fA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\n11\n\non the spectral index derived from the slope of its SED. However, as pointed by Robitaille\net al. (2006), the stage classification is equivalent to the class classification for a great number of models. Therefore, an easy way of identifying young objects is looking for sources\nthat can be fitted only by selected models with \u1e40env > 0. Sources that are fitted by models with zero and non-zero values of \u1e40env may be more evolved YSOs whose evolutionary\nstage is not constrained by the data (see Poulton et al. 2008).\nIn Table 1, we report the main results of the fitting output for class I and II sources\nprojected onto the molecular cloud. The YSO identification (Col. 1) is taken from Fig. 9. In\nCol. 2 and 3, we report the \u03c72 per data point of the best-fit model and the number on models\nsatisfying Eq. (1), respectively. The remaining columns report the physical parameters of\nthe source, specifying the range of values of the selected models: central source mass, disk\nmass, envelope mass, and envelope accretion rate, respectively. These results permit us to\nconfirm the presence of young objects in the vicinity of the IR dust bubble N65.\n\nTable 1.

These are presumably young objects embedded\nin prominent envelopes. In every case, the selected models are prevalently stage I with a\n\n\f12\n\nA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\nfew stage II. The only exception is source 13, which is fitted by both stage I and stage III\nmodels.\nSources 5, 15, and 20 appear to be the youngest YSOs. They may all be massive central\nsources (between 8 and 10 M\u2299 ) surrounded by envelopes of several solar masses. In the\ncase of 15 and 20, their ages are estimated to be \u223c 104 years. Regarding the source 5, its\nposition is coincident with the ultra-compact HII region G35.02+0.35 and its age is about\n103 years. This is a really young massive source and a clear sign that star formation is still\noccurring in the vicinity of N65.\nThe selected models (i.e., models satisfying Eq. 1) for sources 7, 10, 11, and 12 spread\nover a similar range of values among them. These YSOs contain a central source of mass\nless than 5 M\u2299 and ages between 104 and 105 years.\nFor source 19, we obtain a large number of selected models (85) because for this source\nwe only fitted the four IRAC fluxes. However, all of them are stage I so this source is\nprobably a young object. The large spread in the range of parameters does not allow us to\nconstraint its mass and age.\nProjected onto the molecular cloud, we also identify sources with zero and non-zero\nvalues for \u1e40env : sources 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 16, 21, and 22. The evolutionary stage of these\nsources cannot be assured without doubt because the parameters of the selected models\nare spread over a wide range. We should include fluxes measured at other wavelengths to\nreduce the number of models satisfying the condition defined in Eq. (1). However, we can\nidentify sources that are in their early stages of evolution (embedded or disk dominated)\nbecause the selected models are either stage I or II. This is the case for sources 1, 2, 4, 14,\nand 16. For the remaining sources, 3, 9, 16, and 22, the selected models are distributed\nbetween stages I, II, and III so their evolutionary stage cannot be established without\ncontroversy.\nWe note that source 21 is located at the center of the smaller IR bubble introduced in\nSect. 3 that lies right upon the PDR of N65 (see Fig. 2). We fitted the SED of the source\nand obtained more than 1600 models satisfying Eq. (1) and, consequently, a wide range of\nphysical parameters for the YSO, so we cannot establish its evolutionary stage. However,\nits location in the center of the smaller IR dust bubbles suggests that this source may be a\nsecond generation massive star blowing a stellar wind strong enough to evacuate a bubble\naround itself. More observations are needed to investigate this scenario.\nIn conclusion, the SED study confirms the existence of several YSOs possibly embedded\nin the molecular clumps that surround N65, which is indicative of the collect and collapse\nprocess occurring in this region.\n\n3.5. SED analysis of the EGO G35.03+0.35\nWe derive the SED for the EGO G35.05+0.35 using the fluxes in the Spitzer-IRAC 4.5,\n5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm bands (the GPSC reports no detection in the 3.6 \u03bcm band and the source\nis absent in the 2MASS catalog). We also use fluxes in the far IR of the SCUBA bands of\n450 and 850 \u03bcm and in the band of 1200 \u03bcm measured by the SIMBA bolometer at SEST\n(Hill et al. 2006). Both the SCUBA and SIMBA datasets have a lower angular resolution\n\n\fA.

For this reason, we perform a fitting of the SED by considering\ntwo different cases: a) assuming that the far IR data represent the flux emitted only by\nthe EGO, the SED of the best-fit model being shown in Fig. 10 (left); and b) using the\nfar IR data as an upper limit (i.e., assuming that the emission originates in the EGO and,\nprobably, other sources around it), the SED of the best-fit model in this case being shown\nin Fig. 10 (right). In Table 2, we report the physical parameters of the selected models,\nconsidering both SCUBA and SIMBA data as flux emitted only by the EGO (case a) and\nupper limits (case b).

Best-fit SED model for the EGO G35.05+0.35. The points in blue are the measured\nfluxes at the Spitzer-IRAC bands of 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm, the SCUBA bands of 450 and 850 \u03bcm,\nand the band of 1,200 \u03bcm measured with the SIMBA bolometer at SEST. Left: SCUBA and\nSIMBA data are assumed to represent flux emitted only by the EGO. The total flux (black line)\nis completely dominated by the flux from the envelope as would be expected in a young stellar\nobject at its earlier stages of evolution. Right: SCUBA and SIMBA data are taken to be an upper\nlimit. The total flux at the longer wavelengths is dominated by the envelope, while at the shorter\nwavelengths the main contributions originates in the disk (red line) and the central source (blue\nline).\n\nTable 2.

As pointed out by Robitaille et al. (2006), the envelope of sources with high\naccretion rates becomes optically thick. In our case of \u1e40env \u223c 10\u22123 M\u2299 /yr, radiation\nemitted by both the central source and the disk is probably absorbed and re-emitted by\n\n\f14\n\nA. Petriella et al.: The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65\n\nthe envelope of gas and dust. As can be seen in Table 2, the physical parameters of the EGO\nindicate that it is a massive central source surrounded by a massive envelope. According\nto Fig. 10 (right), if we take SCUBA and SIMBA measurements to be upper limits, the\ntotal flux of the best-fit model is still dominated by the envelope but only at the longer\nwavelengths. In the near and mid IR, the main contribution to the total flux comes from\nthe disk. The accretion rate values that we derived for the envelope are lower than those\nderived in the previous case (see Table 2). Thus, the envelope is expected to be more\ntransparent to radiation coming from the inner regions (disk and central source).\nBoth cases show that the fitted SED of the EGO is indicative of a massive central source\nsurrounded by a massive envelope. The age of the YSO is estimated in between 104 and\n105 years. From these results, we suggest that the EGO G35.05+0.35 is a candidate massive\nyoung stellar object at the earlier stages of evolution with outflowing activity, in agreement\nwith that proposed by Cyganowski et al. (2008). The presence of this object is a clear sign\nthat star formation is occurring in the vicinity of N65.\n\n4. Summary\nWe have conducted a study of the surroundings of the IR dust bubble N65 using largescale surveys and archival data in the radio and infrared bands. The main results can be\nsummarized as follows:\n1. We discovered the presence of a molecular cloud with an arc-like shape enclosing N65\nover its east, north and west borders and centered on a velocity of \u223c 50 km s\u22121 . The\ncloud appears to be fragmented into smaller molecular clumps that are seen right upon\nthe PDR. Based on the distribution and morphology of the molecular gas between 47\nand 55 km s\u22121 , we suggest that the collect and collapse process may be occurring.\n2. The EGO G35.05+0.35 lies in the most intense molecular clump, which belongs to the\ndiscovered molecular shell. From the\n\n13\n\nCO J=1\u20130 emission, we estimated its molecular\n\n3\n\nmass and density to be \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 and \u223c 104 cm\u22123 , respectively. We found that\nthe dust continuum emission, traced by the 850 \u03bcm band, also peaks in this region. We\nestimated a dust-to-gas ratio of \u223c 0.003 for this clump.\n3. From the analysis of the infrared photometry of point sources around N65, we identified\nthree O- or early B-type stars as the most probable candidates responsible for the\ncreation of N65. In addition, we found many YSOs distributed right upon the molecular\nclumps around N65. The analysis of the SED of these sources confirms that many of\nthem are in the embedded or disk-dominated stage. This suggests that the gas collected\ninto the molecular clumps may have collapsed to form a second generation of stars,\nshowing another galactic case of the collect and collapse process.\n4. The SED of EGO G35.05+0.35 as derived by fitting the fluxes at the mid and far IR,\nconfirms that it is a massive young stellar object.\n\nAcknowledgments\nA.P. is a doctoral fellow of CONICET, Argentina.
