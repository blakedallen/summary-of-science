This formalism arose as an extension of\nHasimoto's earlier work [3], which had established a connection between the\nequation of motion of a vortex filament regarded as a moving space curve,\nand the NLS. Since all soliton equations [2] possess similar characteristics\nsuch a Lax pair, solvability by the inverse scattering transform method and\nan infinite number of constants of motion, the above mapping to the NLS\nprovided a motivation for a general formulation to investigate the interesting\ncurve evolutions that get associated with soliton-supporting equations.\nCentral to the Lamb formulation is the introduction of the following complex function \u03c8, called the Hasimoto function, defined [3] as\n\u03c8(s, u) = K exp [i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 ds].\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere s is the arc length of the curve and u the time. K(s, u) and \u03c4 (s, u)\ndenote, respectively, the curvature and torsion of the moving curve. It is this\nfunction \u03c8 that satisfies various integrable equations in Lamb's work, and is\nused frequently in the study of various aspects of curve-dynamics [4].\nIt is clear that by comparing the functional form of \u03c8 (Eq. (1.1) with\na soliton solution of a given integrable equation for \u03c8, one can identify\nK and \u03c4 , and hence obtain the associated moving curve parameters that\ncorrespond to an integrable, shape-preserving curve motion. This in turn\n2\n\n\funravels a certain special geometric structure of the given soliton-bearing\nNLPDE. In this Letter, we show that two other complex functions defined\nby \u03a6(s, u) = \u03c4 exp [i Kds] and \u03c7 = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 ), also arise from the basic\nR\n\ncurve evolution equations, just as naturally as the Hasimoto function \u03c8 does.\nWe demonstrate that these can also satisfy various soliton equations. This in\nturn leads to the result that each such integrable equation is associated with\nnot just one, but three distinct classes of space curve motion, and therefore\nhas a much richer geometric structure than hitherto envisaged. We illustrate\nthis by using the NLS as an example.\n\n2\n\nMoving space curves\n\nA space curve embedded in three-dimensions may be described using the\nusual Frenet-Serret equations [5] for the orthonormal triad of unit vectors\nmade up of the tangent t, normal n and the binormal b :\nts = Kn ; ns = \u2212Kt + \u03c4 b ; bs = \u2212\u03c4 n.\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere, s stands for the arc length of the curve.The subscript s denotes (\u2202/\u2202s).\nK and \u03c4 are the curvature and torsion of the curve.\nIf the curve moves with time u, then all quantities in Eq. (2.1) become\nfunctions of both s and u. To describe the time evolution of the triad (t, n, b)\nwe write down the following set of equations [6]:\ntu = gn + hb;\n\nnu = \u2212gt + \u03c40 b;\n\nbu = \u2212ht \u2212 \u03c40 n.\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere, the subscript u denotes (\u2202/\u2202u). As is clear, the parametes g, h and \u03c40\nwhich determine the motion of the curve are also functions of both s and u.\nOn requiring the compatibility conditions\ntsu = tus ; nsu = nus\n3\n\n;\n\nbsu = bus ,\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fa short calculation using Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) leads to\nKu = (gs \u2212 \u03c4 h) ; \u03c4u = (\u03c40 )s + Kh ; hs = (K\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4 g).\n\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\nFormulation (I) using the Hasimoto function \u03c8.\n\nIn Lamb's formulation [1], which will be referred to hereafter as formulation\n(I), the second and third equations of the set (2.1) are combined to yield\n(n + ib)s + i\u03c4 (n + ib) = \u2212Kt.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis immediately suggests the definition of a certain complex vector\nN = (n + ib) exp [i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 ds].\n\n(3.2)\n\nDifferentiating Eq. (3.2) with respect to s and using Eq. (3.1), we get\nNs = \u2212K exp[i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 ds]t.\n\n(3.3)\n\nThus the Hasimoto function \u03c8 (Eq. (1.1)) appears in a natural fashion in\nthe above equation. Using the definitions of N and \u03c8 given in Eqs. (3.2) and\n(1.1) respectively, Eqs. (2.1) can be written in the form\nts =\n\n1 \u2217\n(\u03c8 N + \u03c8N\u2217 ) ;\n2\n\nNs = \u2212\u03c8t.\n\n(3.4)\n\nNext, Eqs. (2.2) take on the form\n1\ntu = \u2212 (\u03b31\u2217 N + \u03b31 N\u2217 ) ;\n2\n\nNu = iR1 N + \u03b31 t,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere\n\u03b31 = \u2212(g + ih)exp[i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 ds] ;\n\nR1 = (\n4\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4u ds \u2212 \u03c40 ) =\n\nZ\n\nKhds.\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fHere we have used the second equation in the set (2.4) to write the last\nequality in (3.6). We use the subscript 1 here, to denote formulation (I).\nFrom Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5), setting Nsu = Nus , and equating the coefficients\nof t and N, respectively, we get\n\u03c8u + \u03b31s \u2212 iR1 \u03c8 = 0;\n\n(3.7)\n\ni\n(\u03b31 \u03c8 \u2217 \u2212 \u03b31\u2217 \u03c8).\n(3.8)\n2\nInterestingly, as noted by Lamb [1], the structure of Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)\nR1s =\n\nwhich arose from compatibility conditions on curve evolution, suggests a\npossible relationship with soliton-bearing equations, via the Ablowitz-KaupNewell-Segur (AKNS) formalism [2] . This is seen as follows : It is well\nknown that for a class of soliton-bearing equations with a function q(s, u) as\nthe dependent variable, the Lax pair L and M in the AKNS formalism are\ngiven by :\nL y =\n\u2202y\ni\n=\n\u2202u\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u2212iq\ni \u2202s\n\u2202\n\u2212iq\u2217 \u2212i \u2202s\n\n\u0013\n\ny = \u03b6 y\n\nA(s, u, \u03b6)\nB(s, u, \u03b6)\ny = M y\n\u2217\n\u2212B (s, u, \u03b6) \u2212A(s, u, \u03b6)\n\u0013\n\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nHere, the eigenfunction y is the column vector (y1 y2 )T and \u03b6 is the eigenvalue\nparameter. Requiring ysu = yus , Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10) lead to the following\nAKNS compatibility conditions [2]:\nqu = 2Aq + Bs + 2i\u03b6B\n\n(3.11)\n\nAs = (Bq \u2217 \u2212 B \u2217 q)\n\n(3.12)\n\nEquations (3.11) and (3.12) are identical in form to Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)\nprovided the following identifications are made :\nq = \u03c8/2;\n\nA = iR1 ;\n\nB = \u2212\u03b31 /2;\n5\n\n\u03b6 = 0.\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fThus the curve evolution equations (2.1) and (2.2) imply AKNS equations,\nwith \u03b6 = 0. Now, \u03b31 and R1 are given in Eqs. (3.6). It was shown by Lamb\n[1] that for appropriate choices of \u03b31 as a function of \u03c8 and its derivatives, R1\ncan be found from Eq. (3.8), and substituted in Eq. (3.7) to yield integrable\nequations for \u03c8.\nAlternatively, once the quantities \u03b31 and R1 are identified so that Eqs.\n(3.7) and (3.8) take on the form of an integrable NLPDE for \u03c8, it is possible\nto find the corresponding Lax pair, by working directly with equations (3.4)\nfor ts and Ns , along with equations (3.5) for tu and Nu : This is done [1] by\nconsidering the constraint t2l + n2l + b2l = 1, where the subscript l = 1, 2, 3 is\nused to represent the three components of the vectors concerned. One then\ndefines a complex function\n(1)\n\nfl\n\n= (nl + ibl )/(1 \u2212 tl ) = (1 + tl )/(nl \u2212 ibl ),\n(2)\n\nalong with its two other counterparts fl\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3)\n\nand fl , obtained by cyclically\n\nchanging t, n and b in Eq. (3.14). It can then be shown that all the three func(\u03b1)\n\ntions fl , \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 satisfy appropriate Riccati equations. The correspond(\u03b1)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\ning Lax pair in each case can then be obtained by setting f (\u03b1) = y2 /y1 ,\nand identifying the corresponding eigenfunction to be the column vector\n(\u03b1)\n\n(y1\n\n(\u03b1)\n\ny2 )T . A short calculation shows that only one of the Lax pairs thus\n\nobtained has the AKNS form of Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10), with entries as in\n(3.13).\nWe paranthetically remark that it is possible to introduce a non-zero\neigenvalue parameter \u03b6 in this formalism, by means of a suitable gauge transformation of \u03c8 in Eq. (3.7). This in turn can be related to a certain gauge\nfreedom [7] in the choice of the orientation of the axes in the plane perpendicular to the tangent of the space curve. The details of this and its\n6\n\n\framifications will be reported when completed.\n\n4\n\nNew formulations (II) and (III) using functions \u03a6 and \u03c7\n\nAs already noted, in Lamb's formulation or formulation (I), one proceeds by\nfirst combining the second and third equations of the Frenet-Serret set of\nequations (2.1), leading to the appearance of \u03c8. In this section, we consider\nthe other two possibilities: Formulation (II), that combines the first and\nsecond equations of (2.1), and formulation (III) that combines the first and\nthird equations. As we shall see, these formulations lead to the appearance\nof two other complex functions \u03a6 and \u03c7 respectively, in a natural fashion.\nFormulation (II): Combining the first two equations in Eqs. (2.1), we get\n\n(n \u2212 it)s + iK(n \u2212 it) = \u03c4 b\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis suggests the definition of a second complex vector\nM = (n \u2212 it) exp[i\n\nZ\n\nKds]\n\n(4.2)\n\nDifferentiating Eq. (4.2) with respect to s and using Eq. (4.1), we get\nMs = \u03c4 exp[i Kds]b. Thus a second complex function\nR\n\n\u03a6(s, u) = \u03c4 exp [i\n\nZ\n\nKds]\n\n(4.3)\n\nappears in a natural fashion in this case. Using the definitions of M and\n\u03a6 given in Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) in the basic equations (2.1) and (2.2), and\nrepeating the steps of Sec.3 , we obtain the following counterparts of Eqs.\n(3.4),(3.5) and (3.6):\nMs = \u03a6b ;\n\n1\nbs = \u2212 (\u03a6\u2217 M + \u03a6M\u2217 ),\n2\n7\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fMu = iR2 M \u2212 \u03b32 b ;\n\nbu =\n\n1 \u2217\n(\u03b3 M + \u03b32 M\u2217 )\n2 2\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere\n\u03b32 = \u2212(\u03c40 \u2212 ih)exp[i\n\nZ\n\nKds] ;\n\nZ\n\nR2 = ( Ku ds \u2212 g) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 hds. (4.6)\n\nWe have used the first equation in the set (2.4) to write the last equality in\n(4.6). The subscript 2 is used on \u03b3 and R to indicate that these correspond\nto formulation (II). From Eqs.(4.4) and (4.5), setting Msu = Mus , and\nequating the coefficients of b and M, respectively, we get\n\u03a6u + \u03b32s \u2212 iR2 \u03a6 = 0;\n\n(4.7)\n\ni\n(\u03b32 \u03a6\u2217 \u2212 \u03b32\u2217 \u03a6).\n(4.8)\n2\nThe structure of Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8) is the same as that obtained in\nR2s =\n\nLamb's formulation (see Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)). Thus using the same steps as\nin the last section, these can also be cast in the form of AKNS compatibility\nconditions (3.11) and (3.12), with the following new identifications:\nq = \u03a6/2;\n\nA = iR2 ;\n\nB = \u2212\u03b32 /2;\n\n\u03b6 = 0.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThis shows that, just as one does in Lamb's formulation, here also we could\ntake choices of \u03b32 , as an appropriate function of \u03a6 and its derivatives, find\nR2 from (4.8), and substitute these expressions in Eq. (4.7) to obtain some\nof the well known integrable equations.\nFormulation (III): Combining the first and third equations of (2.1), we get\n\n(t + ib)s = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 )n\n\n(4.10)\n\nThis suggests the definition of a third complex vector\nP = (t + ib)\n8\n\n(4.11)\n\n\fThis leads to Ps = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 )n. Thus a third complex function\n\u03c7(s, u) = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 )\n\n(4.12)\n\nappears in this case. Using the above definitions of P and \u03c7 given above in\nthe basic equations (2.1) and (2.2), and proceeding the same way as in the\nprevious formulations, we get\nPs = \u03c7n ;\n\n1\nns = \u2212 (\u03c7\u2217 P + \u03c7P\u2217 ),\n2\n\nPu = iR3 P \u2212 \u03b33 n ;\n\nnu =\n\n(4.13)\n\n1 \u2217\n(\u03b33 P + \u03b33 P\u2217 )\n2\n\n(4.14)\n\nZ\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere\n\u03b33 = \u2212(g \u2212 i\u03c40 ) ;\n\nR3 = \u2212h = \u2212 (K\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4 g)ds.\n\nHere we have used the last equation in the set (2.4) to write the last equality\nabove, and the subscript 3 corresponds to formulation (III). \u00bfFrom Eqs.(4.13)\nand (4.14), setting Psu = Pus , and equating the coefficients of n and P,\nrespectively, we get\n\u03c7u + \u03b33s \u2212 iR3 \u03c7 = 0;\n(4.16)\ni\nR3s = (\u03b33 \u03c7\u2217 \u2212 \u03b33\u2217 \u03c7).\n(4.17)\n2\nOnce again, Eqs. (4.16) and (4.17) have the same form as Lamb's result\n(Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)), as well as the AKNS compatibility conditions (3.11)\nand (3.12). Here, the identifications are\nq = \u03c7/2;\n\nA = iR3 ;\n\nB = \u2212\u03b33 /2;\n\n\u03b6 = 0.\n\n(4.18)\n\nThus using the same reasoning as before, for suitable choices of \u03b33 as functions\nof \u03c7 and its derivatives, Eq. (4.16) for \u03c7 can take the form of known integrable\nequations.\n9\n\n\fNow, as is clearly seen from Eqs. (3.6), (4.6) and (4.15), the parameters \u03b3n , n = 1, 2, 3 that arise in the three formulations, correspond to three\ncomplex functions involving different combinations of the curve evolution\nparameters g, h and \u03c40 . Further, the corresponding complex functions \u03c8, \u03a6\nand \u03c7 that appear in the formulations are also different functions of K and\n\u03c4 . (See Eqs. (1.1), (4.3) and (4.12) respectively.) Thus it is clear that the\nthree formulations describe three distinct classes of curve motion. In the next\nsection, we discuss an application to show this explicitly.\n\n5\n\nAn illustrative example: The nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation\n\nNext, we consider the application of our results to the NLS. This example is appropriate not only because the NLS was one of the first integrable\nequations to appear in the context of curve motion [3], but also because it\nhas applications [2] in various fields such as vortex filament motion, optical\nsolitons, magnetic chain dynamics etc.\nFormulation (I): As Lamb has shown, the choice\n\n\u03b31 = \u2212i\u03c8s ,\n\n(5.1)\n\n1\nR1 = |\u03c8|2 .\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhen used in Eqs. (3.8) leads to\n\nSubstituting this in Eq(3.7) yields the NLS:\n1\ni\u03c8u + \u03c8ss + |\u03c8|2\u03c8 = 0.\n2\n\n(5.3)\n\nUsing Eq. (1.1) in Eq. (5.1) and equating the resulting expression to \u03b31\ndefined in (3.6), we get the following curve evolution parameters g, h and \u03c40\n10\n\n\ffor this case:\ng = \u2212K\u03c4 ; h = Ks ; \u03c40 = (hs + \u03c4 g)/K = (Kss /K)\u2212\u03c4 2 (5.4)\nOn the other hand, substituting the above expressions for g and h in the\nfirst equation of (2.2) leads to tu = gn + hb = \u2212K\u03c4 n + Ks b. By using\nEqs. (2.1) and (2.2), it can be easily verified that the above equation implies\ntu = t \u00d7 tss . This is identical in form to the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation\nSu = S \u00d7 Sss for the time evolution of the spin vector S in a continuous\nHeisenberg ferromagnetic spin chain. In this formulation, t, the tangent to\nthe space curve gets identified with S. The connection between the NLS and\nthe LL equation is well known [8] by now.\nFormulation (II): Here, the choice \u03b32 = \u2212i\u03a6s when used in Eqs.(4.8) leads\n\nto R2 = 12 |\u03a6|2 . Using this in Eq. (4.7) yields the following NLS for \u03a6:\n1\ni\u03a6u + \u03a6ss + |\u03a6|2 \u03a6 = 0,\n2\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhich is identical in form to Eq. (5.3) obtained in formulation (I). However,\n\u03a6 = \u03c4 exp[i Kds] here. Using this to find the above expression for \u03b32 ,\nR\n\nand equating it to the expression for \u03b32 defined in Eq. (4.6), we obtain the\nfollowing curve evolution parameters:\nh = \u2212\u03c4s ; \u03c40 = \u2212K \u03c4 ; g = (K \u03c40 \u2212hs )/\u03c4 = (\u03c4ss /\u03c4 )\u2212 K 2 . (5.6)\nThus the above parameters g, h and \u03c40 which describe the curve motion in this\nformulation are quite different from those of formulation (I) (See Eqs. (5.4)).\nIn addition, using the above expressions for h and \u03c40 in the third equation\nof Eqs. (2.2), a short calculation shows that for this curve, bu = \u2212b \u00d7 bss .\nThus, in contrast to formulation (I), it is the binormal of the moving curve\nthat satisfies the LL equation in this case.\n11\n\n\fFormulation (III): Proceeding as in the previous two cases, here the choice\n\nis \u03b33 = \u2212i\u03c7s , implying R3 = 21 |\u03c7|2 . This leads to\n1\ni\u03c7u + \u03c7ss + |\u03c7|2 \u03c7 = 0,\n2\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 ). (See Eq. (4.12)). The curve evolution in this case is\ndescribed by the three parameters\ng = \u03c4s\n\n;\n\nh = (1/2)(K 2 + \u03c4 2 ) ;\n\n\u03c40 =\n\n\u2212 Ks .\n\n(5.8)\n\nThus by direct comparison of Eqs. (5.8), (5.4) and (5.6), we see that\nthe above expressions for g, h and \u03c40 , which describe the geometry of curve\nevolution in this case, are quite different from those obtained in formulations\n(I) and (II). Further, using the parameters given in Eq. (5.8), it is possible to\nshow that the normal to this moving curve satisfies the LL equation in this\ncase, i.e., nu = \u2212n\u00d7nss . We paranthetically remark that the correspondence\nof this equation to the NLS equation has been noted by Hirota in a different\ncontext [10].\nTo demonstrate that the three formulations lead to three distinct space\ncurve evolutions, each with a different set K, \u03c4 , g, h and \u03c40 , we consider the\nsimple example of a one-soliton solution q of the NLS equation:\nq = a0 sech \u03be exp i Ve (s \u2212 Vc u)/2.\n\n(5.9)\n\nHere Ve and Vc denote, respectively, the envelope velocity and carrier\n1\n\nvelocity of the soliton. The amplitude a0 = [Ve (Ve \u2212 2Vc )] 2 and \u03be = (s \u2212\nVe u)(a0 /2). Also, Ve (Ve \u22122Vc ) \u2265 0. Note that any two of the three parameters\na0 , Ve and Vc can be taken to be independent. We have taken the case\nVc = 0 for illustration, and obtained the expressions for K and \u03c4 for this\n12\n\n\fsolution, in the three formulations, by using \u03c8, \u03a6 and \u03c7 defined in Eqs.\n(1.1), (4.3) and (4.12) respectively. These have been entered in Table 1.\nUsing these, the corresponding time-evolution parameters g, h and \u03c40 for the\nthree formulations are computed from Eqs. (5.4), (5.6) and (5.8) respectively.\nThese are given in Table 2.\nNew geometries associated with a soliton solution of NLS: We now\n\npresent the geometrical consequences that arise from the three formulations,\nat the curve level. Let the moving curve be described by the vector r(s, u).\nThus the tangent t appearing in the Frenet-Serret equations (2.1) is defined\nas t = rs (s, u). According to the fundamental theorem of curves [5], smooth\nfunctions K(> 0) and \u03c4 define a curve r(s, u) uniquely, modulo orientation\nin space. Now, from the expressions for K and \u03c4 given in Table 1, we see\nthat formulation (I) yields a moving space curve with constant torsion \u03c4 but\na space-time varying curvature K. On the other hand, the moving curve obtained using formulation (II) has a constant K but varying \u03c4 . In formulation\n(III), both K and \u03c4 are space-time dependent. Since the three moving curves\nhave different (K, \u03c4 ) parameters, our results explicitly illustrate that they are\nindeed geometrically distinct. Further, since they are all gauge equivalent to\nthe NLS, they correspond to integrable curve evolution.\nNow, any moving curve arising from formulation (I) is well known to be\nthe solution of the following \"localized induction (LI) equation\" [3] for a\nvortex filament: ru = rs \u00d7 rss . This is because the LI equation can be\neasily shown to imply the LL equation for the tangent t that appears in\nformulation (I). In contrast, in formulations (II) and (III), the LL equation\nis satisfied by b and n respectively, and hence the corresponding r(s, u) does\nnot obey the LI equation any more. Thus the curves arising from the two\nlatter formulations are distinct from that associated with the LI equation. It\n13\n\n\fis of course, not at all obvious whether analogs of the LI equation (i.e., a PDE\nat the curve level) can be written down for these two formulations. However,\nirrespective of this, it turns out that there is a procedure to construct the\ncorresponding moving curve r(s, u) itself, for each of these formulations. The\nresults of this lengthy calculation will be presented elsewhere.\nClearly, the dynamics of these new curves which get associated with the\nLL equations for n and b respectively, would also be form-preserving curves,\njust as Hasimoto's vortex filament was. These may find applications in fields\nother than fluid dynamics. For instance, a phenomenological modelling of the\nmotion of an interface (regarded as a curve) could be one possible application.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this Letter, we have found new connections between moving space curves\nand solitons using two natural extensions of Lamb's formulation. Our unified\nprocedure demonstrates that a specific evolution of an integrable equation\ncan actually be associated with three different classes of space curve motion,\nthe class discussed by Lamb being one of these. As described in Sec. 3, the\ncorresponding Lax pairs in the three cases can also be constructed. (See Eq.\n(3.14) and the discussion below it [9].)\nApplication to the NLS is discussed. Our analysis shows that the class\nof curves that are solutions of the well known \"localized induction equation\"\nfor a vortex filament is but one of the three classes of moving curves that can\nbe associated with the NLS, i.e., the class connected to Lamb's formulation.\nThere are (as we have shown in general) two more classes, and in order to\nunderstand these new geometric structures of the NLS more explicitly, we\nhave determined the various curve parameters for each of the three moving\n14\n\n\fcurves associated with a one-soliton solution (5.9) of the NLS and displayed\nthem in Tables 1 and 2. While the curve corresponding to Lamb's class has\na constant torsion but varying curvature, the second curve has a constant\ncurvature, but varying torsion. For the third curve, neither of these parameters is a constant. As this example shows, these three are clearly distinct\ncurves. It would indeed be instructive to apply our results to other integrable\nequations as well, and find the three associated geometric structures.\nWe conclude with a general remark on the possible connection between\na singularity in the \"velocities\" (i.e., the time evolution parameters) of the\ngeometric dynamics and that of the associated NLPDE. We have shown that\nthe three complex functions \u03c8 = K exp [i \u03c4 ds], \u03a6 = \u03c4 exp [i Kds] and\n1\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u03c7 = (K \u2212 i\u03c4 ) = (K 2 + \u03c4 2 ) 2 exp [i tan\u22121 (\u03c4 /K)ds], satisfy the same NLPDE,\nR\n\nand that three different moving curves get associated with it. Therefore if a\ncertain solution of the NLPDE has a singularity at a point, then it implies\nthat as the curve evolves, a corresponding singularity will appear in the\ncurvature K of the first moving curve, in the torsion \u03c4 of the second curve,\n1\n\nand in the quantity (K 2 + \u03c4 2 ) 2 for the third. Since these \"velocities\" g, h\nand \u03c40 will be certain functionals of K, \u03c4 and their derivatives for the three\ncurves, the corresponding singularity will be reflected in these velocities as\nwell, and can be studied case by case.\n\n15\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G.L.
