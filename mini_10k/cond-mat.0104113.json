Contrary to expectations, the penetration of\nmagnetic flux in such films is found dominated by large dendritic structures abruptly created when\nsmall fields are applied. The dendritic instability, observed below 10 K using magneto-optical imaging,\nhas a temperature dependent morphology ranging from quasi-1D dendrites to beautiful tree-like\nstructures. This behavior is responsible for the anomalous noise in magnetization curves, and strongly\nsuppresses the apparent critical current. Simulations of vortex dynamics incorporating local heating\neffect reproduce the observed dendritic scenario.\n\nfirst done by measuring the magnetization versus\napplied field (Fig. 1). The vertical width of such\nhysteresis loops represents the integral magnetic\nmoment of the shielding currents, and is to a good\napproximation proportional to the critical current\ndensity, Jc. The magnetization was measured at various\ntemperatures from 25 K and below, and as expected,\nthe loop becomes wider the lower the temperature.\nFurthermore, peaks are present around H = 0 implying\na substantial enhancement of Jc at low fields. At 10 K\nthe behavior evidently changes character as distinct\n\"noisy\" features start to appear in the central part of the\nmagnetization curves. The fluctuations are also\naccompanied by a cutoff of the central peak, thereby\ndecimating the favorable low-field value of Jc. The\namplitude of the fluctuations is found to be largest near\n10 K, while the central peak cutoff is more severe at\nlower temperatures. To reveal the details of this most\nunexpected behavior, found to be typical for such\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nM (emu)\n\nThe new superconductor, MgB2, discovered (1) in\nJanuary this year has already proved to be a promising\ncandidate for technological applications due to success\nin fabrication of thin films (2) and wires (3) with high\ncurrent carrying capabilities. At the same time, such\nfilms and wires, as well as polycrystalline MgB2 are\nreported to show exceptional magnetic behavior\ndisplaying numerous and \"noise-like\" jumps in the\nmagnetization as a function of applied field (3-5).\nMagnetization jumps in type-II superconductors are\nusually associated with a thermo-magnetic instability\nof the quantized flux lines (vortices) penetrating the\nmaterial. When the vortices move they leave a trail of\nelevated temperature facilitating motion of nearby\nvortices, which eventually leads to a large-scale\navalanche invasion of depinned flux lines (6). This\nthermal runaway, where the magnetic energy stored in\nthe superconductor suddenly converts to thermal\nenergy, can cause instability of the superconducting\nproperties and have catastrophic consequences for\npractical applications. To which extent the thermomagnetic instability will affect the technological\npotential of MgB2 is today a vitally important question.\nIn high temperature superconductors (HTSs) the flux\njumps occur only in bulk materials, the first one at\napplied fields of typically one Tesla and then nearly\nperiodically as the field increases. In MgB2 the jumps\nare omnipresent, with the first one occurring already at\na few milliTesla and subsequent jumps coming at\nrandom. Thus, MgB2 appears not only far more\nsusceptible to thermal runaways than HTSs, but the\nflux jumps exhibit also qualitatively new features. All\nthis motivated the present study of MgB2 films using\nmagneto-optical (MO) imaging to visualize and\ncharacterize the nature of the magnetic instability.\nThin films of MgB2 were fabricated on (1\uf8e5\n102) Al2O3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. An\namorphous B film was first deposited, and then\nsintered at high temperature in a Mg atmosphere.\nDetails of the preparation are reported elsewhere (2).\nTypical films had a sharp superconducting transition\n(\u2206Tc ~ 0.7 K) at Tc = 39 K, and a high degree of c-axis\nalignment perpendicular to the film plane.\nMagnetic characterization of the films was\n\n0.0\n5K\n10 K\n15 K\n20 K\n25 K\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n-300\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n\u03bc0H (mT)\n\nFig. 1. Magnetization hysteresis loops for a MgB2 thin film. The measurements were done at different temperatures between 25 and 5 K using a\nSQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS). Pronounced fluctuations in\nthe magnetization are evident at T = 10 and 5 K, while only regular behavior\nis seen at the higher temperatures. The fluctuations indicate that numerous\nflux jumps are taking place. Their magnitude as well as the accompanying\neffect of cutting off (flattening) the central peak vary with the temperature.\n\n\ffilms, we performed space-resolved magnetic\nmeasurements. A sample of thickness 400 nm and size\n5\u00d75 mm2 was chosen for MO-imaging studies.\nShown in Fig. 2 is a sequence of MO images\ntaken during a field cycle at 5 K. Immediately one sees\nthat the magnetic behavior of the MgB2 film differs\ntotally from the usual critical-state type of smooth flux\npenetration patterns. The images for increasing field\n(A)-(D), show that the flux instead penetrates in\ndendritic structures which, one after the other, invade\nthe entire film area. The dendrites nucleate at\nseemingly random places near the film edge, and grow\nto their final size in less than 1 ms (the time resolution\nof our CCD system). Moreover, it is found that once a\ndendrite is formed its size remains constant although\nthe applied field continues to increase. When the field\nis subsequently reduced (E,F), the flux redistributes in\nthe same abrupt manner leading to a remanent state\nwith an overlapping mixture of two types of dendrites \u2013\none containing trapped flux of initial polarity and one\nwith antiflux due to penetration of the reverse return\nfield of the trapped vortices. From these images, which\nmay be directly compared to the black curve in Fig. 1,\nit is clear that the irregular features in the\nmagnetization data stem from the formation of flux\ndendrites.\nA striking change in the morphology of the\nflux patterns was observed when MO-imaging was\ncarried out at different temperatures (Fig. 3 A-C). At\n\n1mm\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nFig. 2. MO images of flux penetration into the virgin state at 5 K (image\nbrightness represents the flux density). (A-D) Images taken at applied\nfields (perpendicular to the film) of 3.4, 8.5, 17, 60 mT, respectively.\n(E,F) Images taken at 21 and 0 mT during the subsequent field\nreduction. Except for an initial stage, the flux penetration is strongly\ndominated by the abrupt appearance of dendritic structures nucleating at\nseemingly random places at the sample edge. The behavior is\nessentially independent of the field sweep rate.\n\nthe lowest temperature of 3.3 K the number of\ndendrites is large, and each dendrite has only a few\nbranches. With increasing temperature the degree of\nbranching grows, as seen in the image taken at 9.9 K,\nwhere a large tree-like structure was formed in one\nsingle burst of flux motion. These results reveal why\nthe fluctuations in the magnetization data changed from\nnumerous small jumps at low temperatures to fewer but\nlarger jumps at 10 K. MO-imaging showed also that\nabove 10 K the dendrite formation never occurs and is\nreplaced by a regular behavior, also this fully\nconsistent with the magnetization data.\nThis remarkable complexity in the flux\ndynamics suggests that an instability is taking place in\nMgB2 films. The fact that unstable conditions exist\nonly at the lowest temperatures points towards one of\nthermo-magnetic origin. It is well known that the heat\nreleased by vortices in motion causes a local\ntemperature rise (large at low T since the specific heat\nis small), which facilitates further flux motion that in\nturn can trigger an avalanche-like invasion. We have\nused this mechanism as basis for vortex dynamics\nsimulations, where aspects particular for films in a\nperpendicular field are taken into account.\nFirst, in superconducting films where the\nthickness is of the order of the London penetration\ndepth, or smaller, the extreme demagnetization results\n\nA\n\n1 mm\n\nD\n\nB\n\nE\n\nC\n\nF\n\nFig. 3.

At low T the dendrites are numerous and with few\nbranches, while just below 10 K only large tree-like structures are formed.\nAbove 10 K the film behaves traditionally according to the critical-state\nmodel.

Also the rapid\ndynamics is there, since avalanches are triggered by a\nsmall incremental step in the applied field, and\nfollowed by a fast growth of the full dendrite. Shown\nred in (D) and (E) are the regions where the recent\nbursts of flux motion have increased the temperature.\nIn general, the most heated part is the core of a\ndendrite, reflecting large traffic of vortices. Due to high\ntemperature the vortices move hastily through this\nregion, and finally the core can end up empty of flux,\nsee Fig. 5. Remarkably, this prediction could be\nconfirmed experimentally, as our MO imaging was\nable to resolve several dendrite cores of low flux\ndensity.\nFigure 6 summarizes our results on flux\npenetration in MgB2 films. Dendritic flux structures\nappear only as the field exceeds a certain temperature\ndependent threshold value. The morphology of the\ndendrites is also changing with temperature.

For a thin rectangular film the Meissner\ncurrent flows (7) as shown by the stream lines in Fig.\n4A, and the Lorentz force FM from this current on a\nvortex is directed as indicated by the arrows. From the\noverall alignment of the dendrites seen in the MO\nimage (B), it is clear that the Meissner current is a\nmajor driving force in their formation. A second aspect\nincluded in the simulations is that in thin films the\nvortex-vortex repulsion Fij is long range (8), and we\nuse here the asymptotic rij-2 dependence.\nThe pinning of the vortices was accounted for\nby assuming a position-independent pinning\nenergy Upin. Uniform pinning was motivated by the\nobservation that when flux penetration experiments are\nrepeated the detailed dendrite pattern is never\nrecurring, i.e., the exact shape and number of dendrites\nvary at random, thus showing that this flux dynamics is\ninsensitive to local variations in the pinning. Finally, it\nis assumed that a trail of elevated temperature follows\nthe path of every moving vortex. More details of the\nsimulations are given in (9).\nSeen in Fig. 3 are the results of simulations\ncorresponding to three different temperatures.

The Bean-model result (7) for a thin strip in a\nperpendicular field was used.\n\n\fbehavior has been observed earlier in niobium films\n(10-12), and in YBa2Cu3O7 when triggered by a laser\npulse (13,14). Its understanding, however, was\nhindered because the existing theories for a thermomagnetic instability (6) were developed only for bulk\nsuperconductors, and considered only a coarse, nondendritic scenario. In thin films the scenario is totally\ndifferent as the flux pattern is strongly branched and\nthe threshold field much lower (15). The thermomagnetic origin of the dendritic instability is supported\nalso by simulations based on the Maxwell and heat\ndiffusion equations (17).\nA key question for technological applications\nof MgB2 is how common the flux jump instability is in\nthis material. From reports published so far the answer\nmay seem pessimistic. Dendritic flux penetration or\nmagnetization jumps have been observed in a large\nnumber of MgB2 samples: In the present high-quality\nfilms with Jc ~ 107 A/cm2, and thickness d = 100400 nm, see also (4), in polycrystalline samples (5)\nwith Jc ~ 105 A/cm2, d ~ 1 mm, and in iron-clad wire\n(3) with Jc ~ 105 A/cm2, d ~ 35 \u03bcm. This wide range of\nJc -values and sample types makes it clear that the flux\njump instability is a strong habit of MgB2 (18).\nHowever, the problem can be fought using methods\nalready developed for conventional (low-Tc)\nsuperconductors, i.e., by introducing thermal\nstabilization as done, e.g., for wires clad with normal\nmetal.\nThe benefits of avoiding the instability in\nMgB2 films can be illustrated by Fig. 7, showing Jc\nfrom 35 K and down to temperatures where dendrites\ndominate the magnetic behavior. This curve represents\nthe \"true\" low-field value of Jc, since the data were\nobtained from flux density profiles in MO images\ntaken before any flux jump was seen. In today's films\nmost global characteristics, such as magnetization, I-V\ncurve and AC losses are actually governed by a much\nlower Jc, here indicated by the dashed line. A challenge\nfor the future is to find practical ways to stabilize the\nmagnetic breakdown, and re-establish the very high\n\"true\" critical current density in MgB2 films.\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nJ.
