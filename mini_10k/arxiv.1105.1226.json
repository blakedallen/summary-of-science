Introduction\n\nThe design and development of English-Lithuanian-English (ELE) dictionary-lexicon\ntool and lexicon database management system (DMS) for MT is oriented to support two main\nrequirements: to be open to the user and to describe much more attributes of speech parts as\nregular dictionary that are required for the MT. Currently, the lexicon is designed to support\nall parts of speech for Lithuanian and English languages. It is possible to extend the same\ndatabase for other pairs of languages as well. Polysemy problem is overcome adding an\nadditional table between two tables linking different translations of the word in the target\nlanguage. The translations for the same words are enumerated in descending priority in both\ndirections. In this way it is possible to ensure that even if the translation won't be very exact,\nthe user will be able to choose the suitable words himself. The possibility to include\nadditional context attributes for the nouns is allowed. Thus the meaning of the word to be\ntranslated first will be chose according to the context and highest priority. The user friendly\ninterface is quite comfortable in that way that it is possible to see all generated forms and that\nis very efficient in the process of filling dictionary with new words. There is ambition to use\nsome additional interface features that might improve user work with MT system: such as\nother meaning choice or selection of words that are being translated and etc. So, if the\ntranslation won't be very exact, the user will be able to define the suitable words adequacy\nhimself. Java and database management system MySql is used to implement the design tool\n54\n\n\fand lexicon database respectively. This solution allows easily to be deployed the MT system\nin the Internet. The system is available to run on various OS such as: Windows, Linux, Mac\nand other OS where Java VM is supported. Currently, only one lexicographer can work on the\nsystem simultaneously, but the import (merging two dictionaries into one) function is under\nway. Since we are using modern DMS, it is not a problem accessing the same database for\nseveral users and mutual exclusion principle is handled by database managing system itself.\nThe Lithuanian Government approved to support this project according to the national\nprogram \"Lithuanian language in Information society for the years 2005-2006 for the\ndevelopment of the Lithuanian language technologies including computer-based translation\".\n2. The linguistic Databases and Electronic Dictionaries for MT: problems and solutions\nFor a long time there was only one bidirectional electronic dictionary WinLED in\nLithuania (VteX company http://www.led.lt/) for Lithuanian-English and Lithuanian-German\nlanguage pairs. The dictionary was comfortable to use, since it had a \u201ecopy and translate\"\nfunction, which allows automatically translate the text copied to the OS clipboard.\nNevertheless, WinLED has several disadvantages: the user interface is in English only, the\nwordlist is too short and misleading translation can be occurring.\nJust recently a new dictionary \u201eTild\u0003s biuras\" has been distributed (http://www.tilde.lt/\nbiuras). It also maintain bidirectional Lithuanian-English and Lithuanian-German\ndictionaries. English-Lithuanian dictionary contains 50000 words and phrases. The\ndictionary proposes not only the translations, but word pronunciation, part of speech and\nusage of the word. The Lithuanian user interface is quite important since a major part of\nLithuanian population is barred from e-content due the lack of good English skills.\n\nAn electronic version of B.Piesarskas \u201eDidysis angl\u0004-lietuvi\u0004 kalbos \u017eodynas\" (Great\ndictionary of English-Lithuanian languages) \u201eAlkonas\" (http://www.fotonija.lt) is more\ncomfortable than previous dictionaries, since it contains the book format and has a huge word\nlist (around 100000) with the words usage examples. The translation is bidirectional, but the\nproblem is that words are indexed only from English to Lithuanian language and Lithuanian\nword translation search is performed using the same index.\nAll these dictionaries are only alternatives for the paper dictionaries since they are more\ncomfortable and are possessed by faster search engine. Nevertheless, they have no additional\ndata that is required for the MT, such as declensions, conjugations and etc. These available\nelectronic dictionaries are generally different from those that are needed for the MT system.\nThe problem is concerned with the requirement to perform not only word-to-word translation\nbut to adjust the syntactic and semantic information as well as further processing of the target\ntext.\n\n55\n\n\fThe 100 million word text corpora for Lithuanian language (http://donelaitis.vdu.lt) is a\nvery important resource for building new lexicons for MT. There are still no operational\nparallel corpora for English and Lithuanian languages. Naturally, the building such corpora is\ntime and effort consuming, since its designing process is rather complex. As an alternative for\nparallel corpora could be comparable corpora. Such corpora should contain texts in both\nEnglish and Lithuanian languages and disseminated according to the topics of the texts.\nThe research on Computer-Based Translation (CBT) was initiated at KTU in 2001\n(Tamulynas 2004: 16\u201319). Several prototypes of CBT systems have been produced, but every\ntime the same problems have been encountered: they were robust and incomplete in terms of\nlexical data (Misevi\u0001ius et al. 2002: 38\u201345).\n3. Conceptual linguistic structure of lexicological database model\nLexicon for MT (Hutchins 1992) or (Trujillo 1999) is a main and most important part of\nthe system. Nevertheless there is no theoretical background what conceptual structure of\nlexicological database model should prevail (Melamed 1998). The fundamental requirements\nconnected with the functionality of CBT system are: flexibility, correctness, translation\nquality and etc.\nAccording to the Lithuanian grammar (Ambrazas et al 1997) it seems enough to keep\nthe word stem in the dictionary only. Actually, this information is not sufficient. We must\nkeep the conjugations, genders, declension, numbers and other attributes. Suitable forms of\nthe Lithuanian words can be generated according to the Lithuanian grammar rules. The stem\nthen is concatenated with the endings (sometimes the stem also has to be modified).\nPrepositions take a very important role in the text. They usually determine the case of\nthe word in the text. So, they must be stored with reference what case do they require. The\ntranslation of preposition combinations (phrases) will be incorporated into the phrase\ntranslation. The conceptual structure of ELE dictionary (lexicon) consists of:\n\u0014\n\nEnglish words with grammatical and semantic attributes as well as with\n\nadditional references to the roles they can perform in the sentence, when they belong to\none or another part of speech, e.g. the noun can be object, subject and etc.\n\u0014\n\ncorresponding Lithuanian words with all grammatical and semantic attributes.\n\nThe semantic information about the correspondence in English and Lithuanian\nlanguages should also be included and possible translation variations might be interpreted.\nThe semantic information consists of the rules or prescriptions how the words may be used in\ncertain context and etc.\n\n56\n\n\fPrevious CBT prototypes (Misevi\u0001ius et al. 2002: 38\u201345) didn't support all parts of\nspeech and was lacking some morphological forms of those parts of speech that have been\nimplemented. Noteworthy, that this new ELE version overtakes all English and Lithuanian\nparts of speech including noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, numeral etc. A large number of all\ngenerated morphological forms (see Table 12) are displayed in tables. In this case it is very\nconvenient to compare the complexity, variety and to check differences between languages.\nFor example, the variety (Ambrazas et al 1997) of Lithuanian regular noun has 14 forms,\nadjective 147 forms and verb over than 229 (around 400). To enter all those words manually,\nwould be time and effort consuming, so automating this process as much as possible is a fair\nsolution. The ending is the variable part of word, which shows the relation with other words\nin the sentence.\nTable 12 Some of Grammatical Categories of Lithuanian and English\n\nPart of\n\nEnglish\n\nLithuanian\n\nSpeech\nNoun\n\n\u0014 Feminine and masculine\ngenders.\n\u0014 Number: the singular,\nthe plural; singular nouns\n(milk), plural nouns\n(scissors).\n\u0014 The genitive case (boy \u2013\nboy's).\n\n\u0014 Feminine and masculine\ngenders.\n\u0014 Number: the singular, the\nplural; singular nouns (laim\u0001),\nplural nouns (\u017eirkl\u0001s, akiniai).\n\u0014 Case is of great importance:\nit indicates a relationship of a\nword with other words in a\ncollocation and the sentence.\nThere are 6 cases.\n\u0014 There are 5 declensions.\nVerb\n\u0014 Regular and irregular \u0014 Inflective by person.\nverbs\n\u0014 Possesses the category of\n\u0014 Conjugating an auxiliary mood (direct, subjunctive,\nverb+ standard form of the imperative).\nverb\n\u0014 4 tenses: present, 2 past,\nfuture.\n\u0014 Main categories of\ntenses are present, past\n\u0014 Characterized by number.\nand future tenses (there are \u0014 Forms, non-inflective by\n12 tenses overall)\nperson: the infinitive,\n\u0014 Modal and auxiliary\nparticiples.\nverbs.\nThe meaning of word is derived according to its possible usage, relation with other\nparts of speech and its place in the sentence, context and etc. The predicate (verb) is most\nimportant since it determines how other words are situated in the sentence and how can they\nbe linked (context dependency).\nThe structure of the dictionary is oriented to the objects. Thus ELE lexicon DB is open\nand operates virtually, i.e. there is a possibility to add new words, terms, phrases or\n57\n\n\fexpressions. This property greatly increases the translation quality. Word dissemination to\nnotional categories makes sentence analysis easier in case the word has several possible\ntranslations. It helps to choose one translation according to the meaning. On numerous\noccasions correct sentence translation is possible when the particular word meaning is\ndetermined by the grammar rules. The polysemy is realized to both translation directions\nusing an additional table which links two tables of different parts of speech.\nSince the system is planned to be developed further, it is desirable to have an additional\ninterface features that might improve user case with CBT. The user interface should be able to\nhelp the user to choose the translation alternatives for the possible translation list, as well as to\nuse the history of translation.\n4. Multilingual Lexicon design and database management tools\nWe have chosen very flexible way of implementing our lexicon (Barisevi\u0001ius,\n\nernys\n\n2004). Since we define our queries to the data using SQL (Standard Query Language), so the\nexact DMS is not essential (we use MySql). The usage of DMS make the lexicon easy to\nmodify: to add new attributes, delete them, or modify the names or types and etc. It is possible\nto extend the same database to other human languages as well. Since MySql can store up to\n2Gb of data we don't have to worry about the volumes anymore. The running test with\ndatabase of 20 million words and the retrieval of the first word took 0.03 seconds, which was\nlonger due to making the connection to the database. The retrieval time of the following\nsearches was less than 0.01 seconds.\nWe considered the domain possibility for the nouns, thus user can choose the priorities\nof finding words in certain domain. This way user can prioritize the word translation\naccording to his domain of interest.\nWhile Java programming language for implementation is used it is possible to make\nsystem available on-line. Naturally, there is a small disadvantage of Java that it is quite slow,\nbut the recent releases of Java Runtime Environment had improved their performance a lot.\nShrinking the compiled code is another option to increase the performance. As the names of\nvariables are shrunk to be minimal, the system operates with shorter names. Besides, the\nsystem is available on Windows, Linux, Mac and other OS where the Java Virtual Machine is\nsupported.\nThe user friendly interface is designed to optimize the work of the lexicographer, that he\ncould select the attributes of the word and generate all possible morphological forms. This\nfeature should save amounts of lexicographers work, since he won't have to enter each form\n\n58\n\n\findividually and besides will be able to see all generated forms in the screen in a very\ncompact way.\nAnother problem of filling is for the lexicographers to work simultaneously. This\nproblem can be easily solved if the system is running on-line. Since, we use state-of-art DMS,\nwe can access the data simultaneously. All the mutual exclusion problems are handled by the\ndatabase system and we don't have to worry about that. The database export and import\nfunctions are under way. Till the end of the year, we are planning to fill the dictionary with\naround 20,000 of words. That should be enough for primitive translation using the most\nfrequent words in the language.\n5. Conclusions\nEnglish-Lithuanian-English dictionary-lexicon tool and lexicon database management\nsystem for MT is oriented to support two main requirements: to be open to the user and to\ndescribe much more attributes of speech parts as a regular dictionary that are required for the\nMT. Programming language Java and database management system MySql is used to\nimplement the designing tool and lexicon database respectively. This solution allows easily\ndeploying this system in the Internet. The system is able to run on various OS where Java\nVirtual Machine is supported. Currently, only one lexicographer can work on the system\nsimultaneously, but the import (merging two dictionaries into one) function is under way. The\nresearch is performed according to the national program \"Lithuanian language in Information\nsociety for the years 2005-2006 for the development of the Lithuanian language technologies\nincluding computer-based translation\". The Tool was demonstrated in DWS (Dictionary\nWriting Systems workshop, Brno) in September 6-7, 2004, as well as in workshop took place\nin Vytautas Magnus University in October 26, 2004.\nReferences\nTamulynas, Bronius 2004.
