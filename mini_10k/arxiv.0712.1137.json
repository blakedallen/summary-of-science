For a matter\ndensity \u03c1 = 1 g cm\u22123 we have 2 GF nB = 7.6\u00d710\u221214 eV,\nyet this small energy shift is large enough to be of almost\nuniversal importance for neutrino oscillation physics.\nIn normal matter, \u03bc and \u03c4 leptons appear only as virtual states in radiative corrections to neutral-current\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\u221a\nand \u03bd\u03c4 scattering, causing a shift \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 = 2 GF Y\u03c4eff nB\nbetween \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 . It has the same effect on neutrino\ndispersion as real \u03c4 leptons with an abundance [2]\n\u221a\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012 2 \u0013\n3 2 GF m2\u03c4\nYn\nmW\n=\n\u22121+\n= 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nln\n(2\u03c0)2\nm2\u03c4\n3\n(1)\nwhere ne = np was assumed. For the neutron abundance\nwe have used Yn = nn /nB = 0.5, but it provides only\na 2.5% correction so that its exact value is irrelevant.\nA large nonstandard contribution to Y\u03c4eff can arise from\nradiative corrections in supersymmetric models [3], but\nwe will here focus on the standard-model effect alone.\nThis \"mu\u2013tau matter effect\" modifies oscillations if\n2\n\u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 >\n\u223c \u2206m /2E. For propagation through the Earth\n2\nand for \u2206matm = 2\u20133\u00d710\u22123 eV2 , this occurs for neutrino\nenergies E >\n\u223c 100 TeV. The oscillation length then far exceeds rEarth so that \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 is irrelevant for the high-energy\nneutrinos that are searched for by neutrino telescopes.\n\nY\u03c4eff\n\n\u2217 UMR\n\nParis)\n\n7164 (CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris 7, CEA, Observatoire de\n\nAlternatively, the mu\u2013tau matter effect can be important at the large densities encountered by neutrinos streaming off a supernova (SN) core [4]. For E =\n20 MeV the condition \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 = \u2206m2atm /2E implies \u03c1 \u2248\n3 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22123 . Numerical SN density profiles [5] reveal that this occurs far beyond the shock-wave radius\nduring the accretion phase, but retracts close to the neutrino sphere after the explosion has begun. To illustrate\nthis point we show in Fig. 1 the same matter density\nprofiles as in Ref. [5] at 1 ms post bounce (red line)\nand at 1 s post bounce (blue line). As a green horizontal band we indicate the condition \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 = \u2206m2atm /2E\nfor a typical range of SN neutrino energies, whereas the\nyellow and light-blue bands indicate the densities corresponding to the H-resonance (driven by \u2206m2atm ) and\nthe L-resonance (driven by \u2206m2sol ). The \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and\n\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 fluxes from a SN are virtually identical, leaving the\n\u03bc\u03c4 -resonance moot, whereas the H- and L-resonances\ncause well-understood consequences that are completely\ndescribed by the energy-dependent swapping probabilities for \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e with some combination \u03bdx of the \u03bc and\n\u03c4 flavor [6]. Therefore, the traditional view has been that\ngenuine three-flavor effects play no role for SN neutrino\noscillations unless mu and tau neutrinos are produced\nwith different fluxes [4].\nIn a recent series of papers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,\n14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] it was recognized,\nhowever, that the traditional picture was not complete:\nneutrino-neutrino interactions cause large collective flavor transformations in the SN region out to a few 100 km\n(gray shaded region in Fig. 1). With the exception\nof Refs. [21, 22], only two-flavor conversions driven by\n\u2206m2atm and the small \u039813 have thus far been studied.\nWe here extend our previous numerical solutions [17]\nto the case of three neutrino flavors. Our main results\ncan be summarized as follows: (i) A two-flavor treatment indeed captures the full effect if one ignores \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4\nand if the ordinary MSW resonances occur outside of the\n\n\f-1\n\nProfiles (km )\n\n2\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian is [23]\nZ 3\n\u221a\nd q\n(\u033aq \u2212 \u033a \u0304q ) (1\u2212vq *vp ) , (3)\nHp = \u03a9p +V+ 2 GF\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n1 ms\n\u03bc\u03c4\n1s\nrsyn\n\n10\n1\n-1\n\nH\n\n10\n-2\n\n10\n\nL\n\n-3\n\n10\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\nr (km)\nFIG. 1: Density profiles in terms of the weak potential \u2206V =\n\u221a\n2 GF ne at 1 ms and 1 s post bounce of the numerical SN\nmodels described in Ref.

As horizontal bands we indicate\nthe conditions \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 = \u2206m2atm /2E, \u2206V = \u2206m2atm /2E, and\n\u2206V = \u2206m2sol /2E for a typical range of SN neutrino energies.\nThe gray shaded range of radii corresponds to the region of\ncollective neutrino transformations. Within the radius rsyn\nthe collective oscillations are of the synchronized type.\n\ncollective neutrino region. (ii) Including \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 strongly\nmodifies the \u03bde or \u03bd\u0304e survival probabilities, influencing\nthe neutrino signal from the next galactic SN. (iii) The\neffect depends sensitively on a possible deviation from\nmaximal \u039823 . The purpose of our paper is to provide a\nfirst illustration of these findings that no doubt need to\nbe refined in future.\nOur work is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present\nthe equations of motion which are solved for the threeflavor neutrino fluxes in a simplified scenario for the SN\nenvironment. In Sec. III we consider the limit of a vanishing \u03bc\u03c4 matter effect, while our results when it is significant are described in Sec. IV. We conclude in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION\n\nMixed neutrinos are described by matrices of density\n\u03c1p and \u03c1\u0304p for each (anti)neutrino mode. The diagonal\nentries are the usual occupation numbers whereas the offdiagonal terms encode phase information. The equations\nof motion (EOMs) are\ni\u2202t \u033ap = [Hp , \u033ap ] ,\n\n(2)\n\nvp being the velocity. The matrix of vacuum oscillation\nfrequencies is \u03a9p = diag(m21 , m22 , m23 )/2|p| in the mass\nbasis. The matter effect \u221a\nis represented, in the weak interaction basis, by V = 2 GF nB diag(Ye , 0, Y\u03c4eff ). For\nantineutrinos the only difference is \u03a9p \u2192 \u2212\u03a9p .\nIn spherical symmetry the EOMs can be expressed as\na closed set of differential equations along the radial direction [17, 20]. We solve them numerically as previously\ndescribed [17], now using 3 \u00d7 3 matrices instead of polarization vectors. The factor (1 \u2212 vq * vp ) in the Hamiltonian implies \"multi-angle effects\" for neutrinos moving\non different trajectories [8, 9, 11]. However, for realistic\nSN conditions the modifications are small, allowing for a\nsingle-angle approximation. We implement this approximation by launching all neutrinos with 45\u25e6 relative to\nthe radial direction [17].\nAs a further simplification we use a monochromatic\nspectrum (E = 20 MeV), ignoring the \"spectral splits\"\ncaused by collective oscillation effects [11, 15, 16, 18, 20].\nOscillation effects require flavor-dependent flux differences. One expects F\u03bde > F\u03bd\u0304e > F\u03bd\u03bc = F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc = F\u03bd\u03c4 = F\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 .\nThe equal parts of the fluxes drop out of the EOMs, so\nas initial condition we use F\u03bd\u03bc ,\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ,\u03bd\u03c4 ,\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 = 0 and F\u03bde =\n(1 + \u01eb)F\u03bd\u0304e with \u01eb = 0.25.\nFor the neutrino parameters we use \u2206m212 = \u2206m2sol =\n7.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 , \u2206m213 = \u2206m2atm = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\nsin2 \u039812 = 0.32, sin2 \u039813 = 0.01, and a vanishing Dirac\nphase \u03b4 = 0, all consistent with measurements [24,\n25, 26]. We consider the entire allowed range 0.35 \u2264\nsin2 \u039823 \u2264 0.65 because our results depend sensitively on\n\u039823 .\nWe use a fixed matter profile of the form \u03c1 \u221d r\u22123 ,\nimplying a radial variation of the weak potential of\n\u0012 \u00133\nR\n\u2206V = Ye \u03bb0\n,\n(4)\nr\nwhere R = 10 km is our nominal neutrino-sphere radius\nand Ye = 0.5. In Fig. 1 we show this profile (dashed lines)\nfor two different values of \u03bb0 = 4 \u00d7 106 km\u22121 and \u03bb0 =\n5 \u00d7 109 km\u22121 . For the former case, the H-resonance is at\nrH = 1.9 \u00d7 103 km, the L-resonance at rL = 8.3 \u00d7 103 km,\nand the \u03bc\u03c4 -resonance at r\u03bc\u03c4 = 71 km. For the latter\nthey are at rH = 2.0 \u00d7 104 km, rL = 9.0 \u00d7 104 km, and\nr\u03bc\u03c4 = 760 km.1\nThe strength of the neutrino-neutrino interaction can\nbe parametrized by\n\u221a\n\u03bc0 = 2GF (F\u03bd\u0304Re \u2212 F\u03bd\u0304Rx ) ,\n(5)\n\n1\n\nWe loosely refer to the radius where \u2206m2atm /2E = \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 as the\n\u03bc\u03c4 resonance, although this would be correct only for a small\nvacuum mixing angle in the 23-subsystem.\n\n\f3\nwhere the fluxes are taken at the neutrino-sphere radius R. As in our previous work [17] we shall assume\n\u03bc0 = 7 \u00d7 105 km\u22121 . In the single-angle approximation where all neutrinos are launched with 45\u25e6 relative\nto the radial direction [17], the radial dependence of the\nneutrino-neutrino interaction strength can be explicitly\nwritten as\n\u03bc(r) = \u03bc0\n\nR4\n1\n.\nr4 2 \u2212 R2 /r2\n\n(6)\n\nWhile the r\u22124 scaling of \u03bc(r) for r \u226b R is generic, the\noverall strength \u03bc0 depends on the neutrino fluxes and\non their angular divergence, i.e., on the true radius of the\nneutrino sphere. Our R = 10 km is not meant to represent the physical neutrino sphere, it is only a nominal\nradius where we fix the inner boundary condition for our\ncalculation.\nThe collective neutrino oscillations are of the synchronized type within the \"synchronization radius.\" For our\nchosen \u03bc0 and for the assumed excess \u03bde flux of 25% we\nfind rsyn \u2243 100 km as indicated in Fig. 1. Collective flavor transformations occur at r > rsyn . Therefore, the \u03bc\u03c4\nmatter effect can be important only if it is sufficiently\nlarge for r > rsyn .\nFigure 1 illustrates that the region where the \u03bc\u03c4 resonance takes place depends on the time after bounce.\nFor realistic values of the matter density profile and\nneutrino-neutrino interaction, one expects r\u03bc\u03c4 to lie far\nbeyond the collective region at early times. This can be\ninferred from the relative position of rsyn and the intersection of the 1 ms profile and the green band. At later\ntimes though the proto neutron star contracts and r\u03bc\u03c4\nmoves to smaller radii. Eventually r\u03bc\u03c4 becomes smaller\nthan rsyn , at which point \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 becomes irrelevant.\nIn order to mimic these different situations we will us\na simple power-law matter profile of the form in Eq. (4).\nIn other words, we will use a mu-tau matter potential of\nthe form\n\u0012 \u00133\nR\neff\n\u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 = Y\u03c4 \u03bb0\n,\n(7)\nr\nwith a fixed Y\u03c4eff given by Eq. (1) and a variable coefficient \u03bb0 . Therefore early and late times can be reproduced by considering large and small values of \u03bb0 , respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 1. In other words, we\nwill always assume that the ordinary MSW resonances\nare far outside of the collective neutrino region, whereas\nthe \u03bc\u03c4 resonance can lie at smaller (vanishing \u03bc\u03c4 matter\neffect) or larger (large \u03bc\u03c4 matter effect) radii than rsyn .\nIII.\n\nVANISHING MU-TAU MATTER EFFECT\n\nAs a first case we consider the traditional assumption\nof a vanishing \u03bc\u03c4 matter effect, which we account for using a value of \u03bb0 = 4 \u00d7 106 . We assume an inverted\n\u2206m2atm and use a non-maximal value sin2 \u039823 = 0.4.\n\nOur numerical calculations for this case are shown in the\ntop row of Fig. 2. The first two panels correspond to\nthe radial evolution of the fluxes of the weak interaction\neigenstates of neutrinos and antineutrinos, respectively,\nwhereas in the last two panels we show the evolution of\nthe propagation eigenstates. These are the eigenstates\nof \u03a9p + V, i.e., of that part of the Hamiltonian Eq. (3)\nthat does not include the neutrino-neutrino interactions.\nIn the collective neutrino region, we observe the usual\npair conversion of the \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e fluxes into the \u03bc and \u03c4\nflavors. Had we chosen a maximal 23 mixing angle, the\nappearance curves for these flavors would be identical.\nFor larger distances the evolution consists of ordinary\nMSW transformations that are best pictured in the basis\nof instantaneous propagation eigenstates in matter (last\ntwo panels). Beyond the collective transformation region,\nall neutrinos and antineutrinos stay fixed in their propagation eigenstates. In the weak-interaction basis, on the\nother hand, this implies fast oscillations because we have\na fixed energy, preventing kinematical decoherence between different energy modes. In the panels for neutrino\nand antineutrino interaction states, for radii beyond the\ndense-neutrino region we show as thick lines the average\nevolution as well as the envelopes of the fast-oscillating\nflavor fluxes.\nAnother way of describing this evolution is by the level\ncrossing schemes of Fig. 3. The upper panel represents\nthe case of vanishing \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 , corresponding to Fig. 5d of\nRef. [6]. The central panel represents the case with large\n\u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 and a 23-mixing angle in the first octant and is\nsimilar to Fig. 2 of Ref. [4]. In such plots one shows\nthe neutrino energy levels as a function of the matter\ndensity. The continuation of this diagram to negative\ndensities gives us the energy levels of antineutrinos: the\nneutrino energy at a negative density really means the\nantineutrino energy at the corresponding positive density. For vanishing density (vacuum), we have the three\nvacuum mass eigenstates that are identical for neutrinos\nand antineutrinos. The upper (blue) line corresponds to\npropagation eigenstate 2, the middle (green) line to 1,\nand the bottom (red) line to 3, a scheme representing\nthe inverted hierarchy case. These lines represent the\npropagation eigenstates that are adiabatically connected\nfor different densities.\nWhile in vacuum the propagation eigenstates coincide\nwith the mass eigenstates, at large densities they correspond to weak interaction eigenstates. For vanishing\n\u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 and at the low energies relevant to our problem,\nthe \u03bc and \u03c4 flavor are not distinguishable so that any\nconvenient linear combination can be chosen as interaction eigenstates. It is convenient to introduce the states\n\u03bd\u03bc\u2032 and \u03bd\u03c4\u2032 that correspond to a vanishing 23-mixing angle,\ni.e., they diagonalize the 23-subsystem. If the small 13mixing angle were to vanish, the 3-mass eigenstate would\ncoincide with \u03bd\u03c4\u2032 . In the upper panel of Fig. 3 and using\nthe (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc\u2032 , \u03bd\u03c4\u2032 ) basis, the 2-state connects adiabatically\nto \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\u2032 , whereas the 3-state connects adiabatically\nto \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bd\u03c4\u2032 .\n\n\f4\n\n1.2\n\n6\n\n2\n\n\u03bb0=4x10 , sin \u03b823=0.4\n\n1.0\n\u03bdm3\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n\u03bde\n\n_\n\n0.2\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\n0.0\n1.2\n\n9\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n2\n\n\u03bb0=5x10 , sin \u03b823=0.4\n\n1.0\n\u03bdm1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n\u03bde\n\n_\n\n0.2\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\n0.0\n1.2\n\n9\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n2\n\n\u03bb0=5x10 , sin \u03b823=0.5\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03bde\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n_\n\n0.2\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\n0.0\n1.2\n\n9\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n2\n\n\u03bb0=5x10 , sin \u03b823=0.6\n\n1.0\n\u03bdm3\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm2\n\n\u03bde\n\n_\n\n0.2\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\n0.0\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n\u03bdm3\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n2\n\n_\n\n\u03bdm1\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\nr (km)\nFIG. 2: Radial evolution of the neutrino fluxes, normalized to the initial \u03bd\u0304e flux, for a fixed neutrino energy (E\u03bd = 20 MeV)\nand an inverted \u2206m2atm . From left to right: neutrino weak eigenstates, antineutrino weak eigenstates, neutrino propagation\neigenstates and antineutrino propagation eigenstates. In the first two columns, after bipolar conversions we show the average\nas thick lines and the envelopes of the fast-oscillating curves as thin lines. The top row shows the case of a vanishing \u03bc\u03c4 matter\neffect, while the three bottom rows use a large \u03bc\u03c4 effect with different values for the 23 mixing angle as indicated.\n\nAt the neutrino sphere, the fluxes are prepared in\n\u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e eigenstates, which in the case of inverted\nmass hierarchy coincide with the propagation (or matter) eigenstates \u03bd2m and \u03bd\u03043m , respectively. In the absence\nof neutrino-neutrino interactions, since the L-resonance\nis always adiabatic, the \u03bde 's leave the star as \u03bd2 . In the\n\ncase of \u03bd\u0304e the evolution depends on sin2 \u039813 [6]. For\nvalues larger than 10\u22123 they propagate also adiabatically (MSW transformation) and escape as \u03bd\u03043 , whereas\nfor values smaller than 10\u22125 the transition at the Hresonance is strongly non-adiabatic: there is a jump of\nmatter eigenstates from \u03bd\u03043m to \u03bd\u03041m and the \u03bd\u0304e 's leave the\n\n\f5\n\u03bde\n\nH\n\n_\n\n\u03bd'\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd2m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd2m\n\n_m\n\n\u03bd1\n\n\u03bd1\n\n_\n\n\u03bd3m\n\nL\n\n\u03bd\u03bc'\n\nm\n\nH\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03c4'\n\n\u03bd3m\n\n\u03bd\u03c4'\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\nne\n\n\u03bde\n\nH\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n_m\n\n\u03bd2\n\n\u03bd2m\n\n\u03bd1m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd1m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd3m\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\nL\n\u03bc\u03c4\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\nH\n\u03bd3m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\nne\n\n\u03bde\n\nH\n\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n_\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u03bc\u03c4\n\n_m\n\n\u03bd2\n\n\u03bd2m\n\n\u03bd1m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd1m\n\n_\n\n\u03bd3m\n\nH\n\u03bd3m\n\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\nL\n\n\u03bd\u03bc\n\n_\n\n\u03bde\n\nne\nFIG. 3: Level crossing scheme of neutrino conversion for the\ninverted hierarchy in a medium with a vanishing \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 (upper panel) and a large \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 with 23-mixing in the first octant\n(central panel) or the second octant (lower panel). The arrows\nindicate the transitions caused by collective flavor transformations.\n\nstar as \u03bd\u03041 . As a consequence, the survival probability is\nP (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) \u2248 sin2 \u039812 and P (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) \u2248 sin2 \u039813 or\ncos2 \u039812 for large and small \u039813 , respectively.\nIn the presence of neutrino-neutrino interactions, important collective effects take place in the inner SN layers,\nwhere the neutrino density is high. We observe in the first\n\ntwo panels of Fig. 2 that collective pair transformations\nconvert the \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e fluxes to \u03bd\u03c4\u2032 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4\u2032 as indicated by\nthe arrows in the upper panel of Fig. 3. The consequences\nfor the subsequent evolution are dramatic. In the case of\n\u03bde a fraction equal to \u01ebF\u03bd\u0304e stays in \u03bd2m and evolves as in\nthe absence of neutrino-neutrino interactions, while the\nrest of \u03bde are transformed to \u03bd3m . As a consequence, the\nfinal \u03bde flux, normalized to the initial \u03bd\u0304e one, is expected\nto be approximately \u01eb sin2 \u039812 \u2243 0.08, see thick line in\nthe upper left panel in Fig. 2. In the case of antineutrinos the effect of the collective pair conversion is to interchange the eigenstates in which \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4\u2032 arrive at the\nH-resonance. Now \u03bd\u0304e enters the resonance as \u03bd\u03041m instead\n\u22123\nof \u03bd\u03043m . Therefore, for sin2 \u039813 >\n\u223c 10 the resonance is\nadiabatic and the \u03bd\u0304e 's leave the star as \u03bd\u03041 , leading to a\nfinal normalized flux of approximately cos2 \u039812 \u2243 0.68,\nsee the thick line in the second panel in Fig. 2. Instead,\n\u22125\nagain there is a jump of matter eigenif sin2 \u039813 <\n\u223c 10\nm\nstates from \u03bd\u03041 to \u03bd\u03043m at the H-resonance. In this case\n\u03bd\u0304e leaves the star as \u03bd\u03043 , leading to a normalized \u03bd\u0304e flux\nequal to sin2 \u039813 .\nThe impact of collective effects is easier to understand\nif we follow the previous literature [10, 12] and observe\nthat, in a two-flavor system, the impact of ordinary matter can be transformed away by going into a rotating\nreference frame for the polarization vectors. Collective\nconversions proceed in the same way as they would in vacuum, except that the effective mixing angle is reduced.\nTherefore, assuming an inverted hierarchy (IH) for the\natmospheric mass splitting and a normal hierarchy (NH)\nfor the solar splitting, we should consider the level scheme\nas in the upper left panel of Fig. 4. The mass eigenstates\nnow approximately coincide with the interaction eigenstates because the 23-mixing angle was removed by going\nto the primed states, and the mixing angles involving \u03bde\nare effectively made small by the presence of matter. Of\ncourse, this level scheme does not adiabatically connect\nto the true vacuum situation.\nThe initial state consists of \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e and thus essentially of \u03bd1 and \u03bd\u03041 . Collective conversions driven by\n\u2206m2atm then transform \u03bd1 \u03bd\u03041 pairs to \u03bd3 \u03bd\u03043 pairs in the familiar two-flavor way. If both hierarchies are normal, we\nbegin in the lowest-lying state and nothing happens. In\nthe hypothetical case where both hierarchies are inverted\n(upper right panel in Fig. 4), we begin in the highest state\nand \u2206m2atm drives us directly to the lowest state. Finally,\nif the atmospheric hierarchy is normal and the solar one\nis inverted (lower right panel in Fig. 4), collective transformations driven by \u2206m2sol take us to the lowest state.\nWe have numerically solved the evolution of the threeflavor system with a realistic SN matter profile and found\nthat the results confirm this simple picture. In a twoflavor treatment, the much smaller \u2206m2sol leads to collective transformations at a much larger radius than \u2206m2atm .\nIn a three-flavor treatment, \u2206m2atm therefore acts first\nand takes us directly to the lowest-lying state if the atmospheric hierarchy is inverted. Otherwise only the hypothetical case of the lower-right panel in Fig. 4 is an exam-\n\n\f6\n\nsin2 \u03b823\n\nIH neutrinos\n\nNH neutrinos\n\n0.65\n\n0.65\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n0.45\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0.1\n\n5\n\nsin2 \u03b823\n\nple where \u2206m2sol plays any role. We have numerically verified that normal \u2206m2atm combined with inverted \u2206m2sol\nis the only case where \u2206m2sol drives collective transformations. Since \u2206m2sol is measured to be normal, the\nprevious two-flavor treatments based on \u2206m2atm and \u039813\nfortuitously capture the full effect.\nWe conclude that in the limit of a vanishing \u03bc\u03c4 effect\nthe collective flavor transformations and the subsequent\nMSW evolution factorize and that the collective effects\nare correctly treated in a two-flavor picture. Of course,\nthis situation may change if the matter profile is so shallow that the ordinary MSW effects occur in the same\nregion as the collective phenomena [21].\n\nIV.\n\nLARGE MU-TAU MATTER EFFECT\n\nNext we calculate the flavor evolution for the same\nmodel, now including a significant \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 , i.e. we assume\na large \u03bb0 . In this case the flavor content of the neutrino\nand antineutrino fluxes emerging from the SN surface\ndepend on the strength of \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 as well as the choice\nof \u039823 , as can be seen in the corresponding panels of\nFig. 2. This dependence is best illustrated with the help\nof the contour plot Fig. 5 where we show the \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e\nfluxes emerging from the SN, averaged over fast vacuum\noscillations.\nIf \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 is so large that the mu-tau effect is strong in\nthe region of collective neutrino oscillations, there are two\nstable limiting cases, depending on the 23 mixing angle.\nIf the mixing angle is sufficiently non-maximal and in\nthe first octant, the collective oscillations transform the\ninitially prepared \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e fluxes to the propagation\neigenstates as indicated by the arrows in the middle panel\nof Fig. 3, i.e., we observe pair transformations to \u03bd\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 .\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\nNH antineutrinos\n\nIH antineutrinos\n\nFIG. 4: Vacuum level diagram for all hypothetical combinations of atmospheric and solar mass hierarchies (normal or\ninverted).

All\nfluxes are normalized to the initial \u03bd\u0304e flux. We show values\naveraged over fast vacuum oscillations.\n\nThis behavior is understood if we assume that in the\n\u03bc\u03c4 system we can once more go to a rotating frame and\nnow simply imagine that the 23 mixing angle is effectively\nsmall by the impact of the \u03bc\u03c4 matter effect. In this case\n\u03bd3 \u2248 \u03bd\u03c4 . Since collective quasi-vacuum oscillations take\nus to the lowest-lying state, the \u03bd3 state in the inverted\nhierarchy, we are effectively taken to \u03bd\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 pairs. Instead,\nif the 23 mixing angle is in the second octant, \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4\nswitch roles, explaining that now \u03bd3 \u2248 \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03043 \u2248 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc .\nThese are only heuristic explanations. We expect that\nthey can be made precise in a true analytic three-flavor\ntreatment of collective neutrino oscillations along the\nlines of Ref. [22].\nFor intermediate values of \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 and for 23 mixing angles near maximal, the final fluxes depend sensitively on\nparameters. For intermediate values of \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 , there are\nalso nontrivial effects for the normal hierarchy. The collective effects do not place the ensemble into propagation eigenstates, preventing a simple interpretation. The\nsensitive dependence for intermediate \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 is also illustrated in Fig. 6 where we show the emerging average \u03bde\nand \u03bd\u0304e fluxes as functions of \u03bb0 for two values of \u039823 , one\nin the first and the other in the second octant.

These curves represent cuts through the inverted\nhierarchy contour plots of Fig. 5 at the indicated values of\nsin2 \u039823 .\n\ncorrections to the \u03bc\u03c4 resonance condition.\nThis dependence on the \u039823 octant leads to a clear\nimprint on the final survival probability. Let us first consider the first octant. In the case of \u03bde a fraction equal\nto \u01ebF\u03bd\u0304e stays in \u03bd2m . However the presence of the \u03bc\u03c4 resonance in the neutrino channel makes the rest of the\n\u03bde to be transformed to \u03bd1m . Their subsequent evolution\nwould depend on the adiabaticity of the \u03bc\u03c4 -resonance,\nbut it has been shown to be always adiabatic [4]. As a\nconsequence, the final \u03bde flux is expected to be approximately cos2 \u039812 + \u01eb sin2 \u039812 \u2243 0.76, see thick line in the\nleft panel of the second row in Fig. 2. In the case of antineutrinos the situation is completely analogous to the\ncase of vanishing \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 so that P (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) \u2248 cos2 \u039812 or\nsin2 \u039813 , depending on the value of \u039813 .\nIf \u039823 belongs to the second octant, then the \u03bc\u03c4 resonance lies in the antineutrino channel. The crucial\npoint is that now all \u03bd\u0304e are transformed to \u03bd\u0304\u03bc = \u03bd\u03042m before reaching the \u03bc\u03c4 -resonance, see the lower panel in\nFig. 3. Taking into account that \u03bd\u03042m does not encounter\nthe H-resonance, the survival probability will be always\nP (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) \u2248 sin2 \u039812 , independently of the value of\n\u039813 . On the other hand neutrinos do not feel the \u03bc\u03c4 resonance and therefore their propagation is the same as\nin the vanishing \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 case.\n\n0.5\nsin2\u03b823\n\n\u03bb0 [10 km ]\n\nFIG. 7: Fluxes of \u03bde (top) and \u03bd\u0304e (bottom), normalized to\nthe initial \u03bd\u0304e flux, emerging from the SN as a function of\nsin2 \u039823 for \u03bb0 = 1.85 \u00d7 109 km\u22121 .

One can see the importance of the presence of\ncollective neutrino effects, as well as the dependence on\nthe strength of the mu-tau matter effect.\nAnother interesting feature concerns the position of\nrsyn in the presence of a large \u03bc\u03c4 matter effect. As can\nbe seen comparing the first two rows of Fig. 2, the radius where collective neutrino transformations begin is\n\n\f8\nslightly larger (rsyn \u2243 115 km) when we include a significant \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 . We have checked that, while for a small\n\u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 the position of rsyn is independent of \u039823 , for a\nlarge \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 the onset of bipolar transformations is delayed for nonzero values of \u039823 . This effect is largest for\nmaximal mixing (\u039823 = \u03c0/4) and symmetric relative to\n\u039823 = \u03c0/4. A full understanding of this variation presumably requires an analytic three-flavor treatment in\nthe spirit of Ref. [22].\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nso shallow that the ordinary H- and L-resonances may\noccur within the collective neutrino region [21]. In this\ncase the effects discussed here are irrelevant because the\nmu-tau matter effect is negligible. Probably our effects\nare also negligible during the cooling phase of an ironcore SN. However, flavor oscillation effects are probably\nlargest during the accretion phase of an iron-core SN\nwhere the flavor dependence of the spectra and fluxes\nis more pronounced than during the cooling phase [28].\nWhen it is important, the mu-tau matter effect adds\none more layer of complication to the already vexed problem of collective SN neutrino oscillations. It was previously recognized that \"ordinary\" collective oscillations\nare almost completely insensitive to the smallness of \u039813\nas long as it is not exactly zero. Here we have found\nthe opposite for the large mixing angle \u039823 that is often assumed to be maximal. Even small deviations from\nmaximal 23-mixing can imprint themselves in the collective oscillation effect. Both results are counter-intuitive\nand opposite to ordinary flavor oscillations.\n\nAt the relatively low energies relevant for SN neutrinos, charged mu and tau leptons cannot be produced so\nthat mu- and tau-flavored neutrinos are not distinguishable in the SN or in detectors. (In the inner core of a\nSN the temperatures may be high enough to produce a\nsignificant thermal muon density, but this would not affect the emission from the neutrino sphere.) The impact\nof the small second-order difference between the \u03bd\u03bc and\n\u03bd\u03c4 refractive index does not produce observable effects\nas long as one only considers the traditional MSW flavor\nconversion [4].\nThe picture changes if one includes the unavoidable\neffect of collective neutrino transformations in the region above the neutrino sphere. If the matter density\nis large enough that \u2206V\u03bc\u03c4 is comparable to or larger\nthan \u2206m2atm /2E, the survival probability of \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e\ncan be completely modified and depends sensitively on\nthe mixing angle \u039823 . In future one should also include\nnon-monochromatic energy spectra, leading to spectral\nsplit phenomena that could be more complicated than\nthe previously studied two-flavor cases. One should also\nexplore the impact of realistic angular distributions and\nof a non-zero Dirac phase in the neutrino mixing matrix.\nLower-mass progenitors may collapse with a O-Ne-Mg\ncore and, on the computer, explode easily because there\nis very little mass in the envelope [27]. Even at core\nbounce and immediately afterward, the density profile is\n\nWe thank E. Akhmedov for an illuminating correspondence, A. Mirizzi for comments on the manuscript,\nand B. Dasgupta and A.
