That it has up to\nnow neither been suspected nor observed, and that it will hardly be observed in the\nfuture, is firstly due to its low probability and secondly due to its practically unobservable\ndecay products. The process would run via the emission of the virtual neutral\nintermediate Z0 boson that would in turn decay into the mixture of real neutrinoantineutrino pairs, of all flavors allowed by mass-energy conservation. We shall call this\nthe 2\u03bd decay. Its probability is intrinsically of the order of the probability for beta decays,\nor for the emission of the virtual charged W boson that subsequently decays into the real\nelectron-neutrino lepton pair. However, the 2\u03bd decay mode always competes with the\nmany orders of magnitude more probable electromagnetic decay modes, and is, minding\nthe difficulties with the detection of low energy neutrinos, practically unobservable even\nin highly forbidden isomeric transitions, where the electromagnetic modes are\nsuppressed. As an example we consider the decay of the 388 keV isomeric state in 87Sr,\nwhich is a well known case of the cascade of beta decays that compete successfully with\nthe electromagnetic decay (Fig.1) (see [1]). This succession of weak decays shares the\nsame initial and final states with the electromagnetic and 2\u03bd modes and effectively results\nin the emission of the electron neutrino-antineutrino pair, though it is realized via the two\ncharged current interactions through a real intermediate state, and not by a single neutral\ncurrent interaction, denoted by 2\u03bd and marked by the dashed arrow in the drawing. The\n2\u03bd mode should here have a practically unobservable branching ratio smaller than\n2.8h/4.75\u00d71010y, due to the spin difference which is necessarily higher than that for the\nalready highly forbidden beta decay of 87Rb, for which the log ft value equals 17.6. Since\nit is not very likely that the more favorable case is supplied by nature, the 2\u03bd decay mode\nis probably bound to remain just another curiosity in the nuclear zoo.\n1/2\u2212\n\n388 keV\n\n0.3% EC\n3/2\u2212\n\n2.8 h\n\n4.75\u00d71010y\n87\n\nRb\n\n100% \u03b2\u2212\nlog ft = 17.6\n\nM4\n\n2\u03bd\n\n9/2+\n87\n\nSr\n\nFig.1.
