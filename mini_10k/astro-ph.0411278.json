They\nappear to be more compact and with a more pronounced peak in the surface\nbrightness distribution than other types of HII regions. Regarding the properties of their stellar ionising populations, \u00c1lvarez-\u00c1lvarez, D\u00edaz & Castellanos (2003) needed a composite population with both a just-formed burst and\nan older one in the WR-phase in order to explain some emission-line ratios,\nWolf-Rayet features and blue colors. There is a coincidence in this point with\nsome recent results for HII galaxies (P\u00e9rez-Montero & D\u00edaz, 2004). Some\nof the properties of CNSFRs have been studied, analyzing a sample of them\nthrough spectrophotometrical observations, using diagnostic emission-line ratios involving oxygen and sulphur. The deduced properties have been compared with those of other families of objects and results from photo-ionisation\nmodels.\n\n\f2\n\n2.\n\nThe sample of studied objects\n\nWe have selected a sample of emission line-objects from the literature with\n[OII], [OIII], [SII] and [SIII] emission lines, thus obtaining different empirical\ncalibrators of the functional parameters, for different families of HII regions,\nincluding Giant extragalactic HII regions and HII galaxies. With the aim of\ncomparing these properties with those of CNSFRs, we have compiled data\nfrom P\u00e9rez-Olea (1996) with observations of CNSFRs in NGC2903, NGC3351\nand NGC3504, that include these lines as well. Data for other CNSFRs (M51;\nD\u00edaz et al. 1991, NGC 3310; Pastoriza et al. 1993 and NGC 7714; Gonz\u00e1lezDelgado et al. 1995) have been added too.\n\n3.\n\nFunctional parameters\n\nPhotoionisation equilibrium in HII regions is governed by three main parameters so-called functional: the metallicity, the ionisation parameter (i.e. the\nquotient of ionising photons to the density of particles) and the hardness of the\nincident continuum. In previous works it has been shown that the estimation\nof these parameters through the sulphur emission lines provide values of them\nwith a high level of confidence.\n\n9,5\n\n12+log(O/H)\n\n9,0\n\nGalaxy and MCs\nHII Galaxies\nGEHRs\nCNSFRs\n\n8,5\n\n8,0\n\n7,5\n\n7,0\n-2,0\n\n-1,5\n\n-1,0\n-0,5\nlog(S23/O23)\n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\nFigure 1.\nRelation between the metallicity, in terms of 12+log(O/H), and the S23/O23 parameter for different families of HII regions, including CNSFRS.\n\n\fIonising stellar populations incircumnuclear star-forming regions\n\n3\n\nMetallicity\nMany CNSFRs are objects with very large metallicites (Z \u2265 Z\u2299 ), and it\nis no possible to ascertain their oxygen abundances through the direct method\nand, therefore, it is compulsory to use empirical parameters. For this sample\nwe have used the parameter S23/O23 (D\u00edaz & P\u00e9rez-Montero, 2000), that leads\nto values of oxygen abundance at high metallicities with little uncertainty. For\nthe sample of CNSFRS from P\u00e9rez-Olea, , upper right corner in figure 1, we\nobtain values between 1.09 and 2.88 Z\u2299 . On the other hand, the CNSFRS with\nlow metallicities, for which it is possible to apply the direct method, present\nabundances between 0.22 and 0.55 Z\u2299 .\n\n9,5\n\n12+log(O/H)\n\n9,0\n\n8,5\n\n8,0\n\n7,5\n\n7,0\n-2,0\n\n-1,5\n\n-1,0\n\n-0,5\n0,0\nlog([SII]/[SIII])\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\nFigure 2. Relation between [SII]/[SIII] and the metallicity. For CNSFRS, this last obtained\nfrom the S23/O23 parameter.\n\nIonisation parameter\nIt gives an idea of the excitation degree inside the nebula. Although, the\n[OII]/[OIII] ratio has been used frequently to parametrise it, we have used\n[SII]/[SIII] (D\u00edaz et al., 1991), because this ratio has no dependence on effective temperature. This parameter, as we can see in figure 2, does not present\nany correlation with metallicity. CNSFRs, contrary to HII galaxies, tend to\npresent large values of [SII]/[SIII], what implies low degrees of excitation.\n\n\f4\n\nEffective temperature\nThe temperature of the field of radiation can be deduced from the parameter\n\u03b7 ' (V\u00edlchez & Pagel, 1988), that is defined as a function of the bright emission\nlines of oxygen and sulphur:\nlog \u03b7 \u2032 =\n\nlog([OII])/ log([OIII])\nlog([SII])/ log([SIII])\n\nAs we can see in figure 3, there seems to be a sequence defined by this temperature and the metallicity, represented by S23/O23 in this diagram, in such a way\nthat, for instance, low metallicities correspond to higher effective equivalent\ntemperatures. This is to be expected from stellar atmospheres theory. Nevertheless, CNSFRs are an exception because, independently of their oxygen\nabundance they present always very high effective temperatures.\n\n0,5\n\nlog (S23/O23)\n\n0,0\n\n-0,5\n\n-1,0\n\n-1,5\n-1,0\n\n-0,5\n\n0,0\nlog \u03b7'\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\nFigure 3.\nRelation between S23/O23 and the \u03b7' parameter. CNSFRS break the expected\nrelation between metallicity and effective equivalent temperature.\n\n4.\n\nPhoto-ionisation models\n\nThere are two main problems that we have tried to adress through the use\nof photo-ionisation models. Firstly, the searching for an explanation for the\nunexpected large effective temperatures found in CNSFRSs independently of\ntheir metallicites. Secondly, the fact that the ionising spectra corresponding to\n\n\f5\n\nIonising stellar populations incircumnuclear star-forming regions\n\n1,5\n\nlog([OII]/[OIII])\n\n1,0\n0,5\n0,0\n35 kK\n\n-0,5\n-1,0\n-1,5\n\nGEHR\nHII Galaxies\nOversolar GEHR\nCNSFR\n\n40 kK\n50 kK\n\n-2,0\n-1,0\n\n-0,5\n\n0,0\nlog([SII]/[SIII])\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\nFigure 4.\nThe \u03b7' diagram. The scale of equivalent effective temperatures, in solid lines, is\ncompared with observations and cluster model atmospheres in photo-ionisation models, represented by squares (see text for explanation).\n\nthe temperatures in these objects and in HII galaxies is harder than the hardest\navailable cluster theoretically predicted spectra. For this purpose we have used\nCLOUDY 96 (Ferland, 2002), with Starburst 99 spectral energy distributions\n(atmospheres from Pauldrach et al. (2001) for O and B stars and Hillier &\nMiller (1998) for WR).\nIn the \u03b7' diagram it is possible to scale Teff. with CoStar model stellar\natmospheres. These are represented as solid lines in figure 4. Both CNSFRs\nand HII galaxies show equivalent temperatures higher than 50 kK, even for\ndifferent excitation degrees and metallicites. Other types of objects lie between\n30 and 40 kK. Open squares represent clusters models with SB99 atmospheres\nat 1.0 Myr. The ionisation structure of the nebula is dominated by these very\nyoung bursts in objects showing high Teff.\nFor each ionisation parameter, different metallicites have been chosen in order to simulate the gas conditions. These models have plane-parallel geometry\nand a constant density of 100 cm\u22123 . They are summarized in table 1.\nAs SB99 models cannot reach the high effective temperatures deduced in\nCNSFRs and, to a lesser degree, in HII galaxies, we have tested to what extent\n\n\f6\nlog U\n-2.0\n-2.5\n-3.0\n-3.5\nTable 1.\n\nZ\n0.001, 0.004\n0.004, 0.008\n0.008, 0.020\n0.020, 0.040\n\nChosen metallicities for each ionisation parameters in the described models.\n\nthe presence of all dust grain physics affects the equivalent temperature in the\nnebula. The models including dust grains are represented by dotted squares in\nfigure 4. Although it is expected an increment of Teff at least at high metallicities, due to depletion factors and internal heating of the gas, there are only\nvariations in the excitation degree, and in non-significant quantities.\nFinally, the geometry of the gas can also affect the inner ionisation equilibrium and the functional parameters may vary their physical meaning. In the\nmodels represented by filled squares in figure 4 we have put the gas near to\nthe ionising source, resulting in a spherical geometry. At low values of the\nionisation parameter and high metallicities, that is the range of CNSFRs, the\neffective equivalent temperature is increased. Nevertheless, at high excitation\ndegrees and low metallicities, that is the range of HII galaxies, there are not\nsignificant variations.\nTherefore, although the mechanism of heating and ionisation of the gas in\nmassive HII regions with very young and efficient processes of star formation\nin all ranges of metallicity is far from being well understood, the properties of\nthe stellar ionising populations through direct observations in different bands\nand future more reallistic assumptions about the geometry of the gas will shed\nsome light on this issue.\n\nReferences\n\u00c1lvarez-\u00c1lvarez, M., D\u00edaz, A.I., & Castellanos, M. 2003, IAUS, 212, 537.\nD\u00edaz, A.I., Terlevich, E., V\u00edlchez, J.M., Pagel, B.E.J. & Edmunds, M.G. 1991.
