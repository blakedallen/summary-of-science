Let G be a reductive group, defined over the Galois field Fp with p being good for G.\nUsing support varieties and covering techniques based on Gr T -modules, we determine the position\nof simple modules and baby Verma modules within the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver \u0393s (Gr ) of\nthe r-th Frobenius kernel of G.

Introduction\nIn the representation theory of finite-dimensional self-injective algebras, the stable Auslander\u2013\nReiten quiver has proven to be an important homological invariant, which has been studied for group\nalgebras of finite groups, reduced enveloping algebras of restricted Lie algebras and distribution\nalgebras of infinitesimal group schemes. In the classical context of Frobenius kernels of reductive\ngroups, the relevant algebras are usually of wild representation type, rendering a classification of\ntheir indecomposable modules a hopeless task. This fact notwithstanding, one does have a fairly\ngood understanding of the connected components of the corresponding stable Auslander\u2013Reiten\nquiver. It is therefore of interest to relate this information to certain classes of indecomposable\nmodules, such as simple modules, Weyl modules or Verma modules, and to identify the position\nof the latter within the AR-quiver. The main problem in this undertaking is the lack of a suitable\npresentation of the underlying algebras, as required by the techniques of abstract representation\ntheory. On the other hand, the theory of rank varieties and support varieties has seen considerable\nprogress over the last years, so that one can hope to exploit these tools in the aforementioned\ncontext.\nIn continuation of work begun in [22], we study in this article those Auslander-Reiten components\nof the algebras Dist(Gr ) that contain simple modules or baby Verma modules. The underlying\nalgebra Dist(Gr ) consists of the distributions of the r-th Frobenius kernel of the smooth reductive\ngroup scheme G, defined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic p. The case\nr = 1, which pertains to restricted enveloping algebras of reductive Lie algebras, was settled in [22]\nby means of a detailed analysis of nilpotent orbits in rank varieties, leading to the consideration of\ngroups of types SL(2)1 \u00d7SL(2)1 , SL(3)1 and SO(5)1 . For r > 1, rank varieties are less tractable and\nthe structure of the cohomology rings defining support varieties is more complicated. We address\nthese problems by passage to Gr T -modules, as described below. With regard to Auslander-Reiten\ntheory, our main results can roughly be summarized as follows:\nTheorem. Let G be a smooth reductive group scheme, defined over Fp . Given a character \u03bb \u2208 X(T )\nand r \u2265 1, the following statements hold:\nDate: June 22, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 16G70, Secondary 17B50.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\n(1) The simple Gr -module Lr (\u03bb) is either projective or it belongs to an AR-component of tree\nclass \u00c312 or A\u221e . In the latter case, the middle term of the almost split sequence terminating in\nLr (\u03bb) is indecomposable.\n(2) The baby Verma module Zr (\u03bb) is either projective or it belongs to an AR-component of tree\nclass A\u221e , with the middle term of the almost split sequence terminating in Zr (\u03bb) being indecomposable.\nThe approach chosen in this article differs from that of [22] by the systematic use of Jantzen's\ncategory mod Gr T of Gr T -modules, which affords almost split sequences. Exploiting the natural\nordering on the weights X(T ), we first study AR-components for Gr T -modules, and then use\ncovering properties of the forgetful functor F : mod Gr T \u2212\u2192 mod Gr to obtain information on the\ncorresponding Gr -modules. The second major advantage of working in mod Gr T is its tractability\nwith respect to coverings G\u0303 \u2212\u2192 G, ultimately allowing us to bring Steinberg's tensor product\ntheorem to bear. Aside from these technical aspects, the highest weight category mod Gr T possesses\nthe much studied subcategory F(\u2206) of Zbr -filtered modules. According to Ringel's seminal work [46],\nthe corresponding categories of \u2206-good modules over finite-dimensional quasi-hereditary algebras\nafford relative almost split sequences. It turns out that in our context these are merely the ARsequences of the ambient Frobenius category mod Gr T .\nOur paper is organized as follows. After a preliminary section, we determine in Section 2 the\nlocation of the simple Gr -modules. For finite groups and restricted enveloping algebras the corresponding problems were studied in [36, 37, 38, 39] and [16], respectively. In fact, since the algebra\nDist(Gr ) is symmetric, Kawata's results [37], that were inspired by the modular representation\ntheory of finite groups, can be brought to bear. With the exception of simple modules belonging\nto blocks of tame representation type, the AR-components containing simple modules are of type\nZ[A\u221e ], with the simple vertex having only one predecessor (see part (1) of the above Theorem).\nIn Section 3 we recall basic results from [19] concerning the AR-Theory of the Frobenius category\nmod Gr T . As a first application, we exploit coverings G\u0303 \u2212\u2192 G to show that each AR-component of\nmod Gr contains at most one simple module. Using fundamental properties of the highest weight\ncategory mod Gr T , we verify in Section 4 the second part of the above Theorem (cf. [52, Thm. B]\nfor the corresponding result concerning trivial source modules over finite groups).\nSections 5 and 6 are concerned with filtrations and varieties of Verma modules. Motivated by\nJantzen's work on blocks of Dist(Gr ) [32], we subdivide the defining highest weights of Verma\nmodules according to their \"depth\". It turns out that questions concerning varieties and ARcomponents of Verma modules can often be reduced to the consideration of highest weights of\ndepth 1. Our method is based on an isomorphism\nVGr (M [d] \u2297k Std ) \u223c\n= VGr\u2212d (M ),\nrelating the variety of a Gr\u2212d -module M to that of the tensor product M [d] \u2297k Std of its d-th\nFrobenius twist M [d] \u2208 mod Gr with the d-th Steinberg module Std . When applied to baby Verma\nmodules, this yields explicit information on the varieties VGr (Zr (\u03bb)).\nOur final Section 7 illustrates the utility of our results and techniques by providing applications\nconcerning Verma modules of complexity at most 2. For instance, the supports of Verma modules\nof complexity 2 are shown to be equidimensional.\n1. Preliminaries\nThroughout, we will be working over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p \u2265 3. Unless\nmentioned otherwise, all algebras and modules are assumed to be finite-dimensional.\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n3\n\nLet G be a connected, reductive, smooth group scheme over k with maximal torus T and character\ngroup X(T ). We fix a Borel subgroup B = T U with unipotent radical U and denote the Lie algebra\nof U by u = Lie(U ). Moreover, we write \u03a8 = \u03a8(T ), \u03a8+ and \u03a3 for the set of roots of G relative to\nT , the sets of positive and simple roots of \u03a8 relative to B, respectively.\nFor \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) and r \u2208 N we put\n\u03a8r\u03bb := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8 | h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1\u2228 i \u2208 pr Z},\n\nP\nwhere \u03c1 := 12 \u03b1\u2208\u03a8+ \u03b1 denotes the half-sum of the positive roots. We say that \u03bb is pr -regular\n(relative to \u03a8) provided \u03a8r\u03bb = \u2205. For r = 1 we simply write \u03a8\u03bb = \u03a81\u03bb . The set of pr -restricted\nweights Xr (T ) of T is defined by\nXr (T ) := {\u03bb \u2208 X(T ) | 0 \u2264 h\u03bb, \u03b1\u2228 i < pr ; \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3}.\n\u223c Z and thus identify weights with integers in this case.\nFor G = SL(2) we have X(T ) =\nr\nGiven r \u2208 N, we let F : G \u2212\u2192 G(r) be the r-th Frobenius homomorphism of G, whose comorphism is\nr\nk[G](r) \u2212\u2192 k[G] ; x 7\u2192 xp .\nAs usual, k[G](r) denotes the k-algebra, whose underlying Z-algebra structure is that given by k[G],\n\u2212r\nwith k acting via \u03b1.x := \u03b1p x (cf. [35, (I.9)]). The infinitesimal algebraic k-group Gr := ker F r is\ncalled the r-th Frobenius kernel of G.\nFor a Gr -module M we define its cohomological support variety VGr (M ) as the variety of the\nkernel of the canonical homomorphism\nHev (Gr , k) \u2212\u2192 Extev\nGr (M, M ),\nr\n\nsee [51]. We consider the r-th Frobenius kernel Ga(r) := Speck (k[T ]/(T p )) of the additive group\nGa \u223c\n= Speck (k[T ]) and recall that\n\u223c k[X0 , . . . , Xr\u22121 ]/(X p , . . . , X p ),\nDist(Ga(r) ) =\n0\n\nwith Xi corresponding to the functional xi \u2208 Dist(Ga(r) ) = k[Ga(r)\n\nr\u22121\n\u2217\n] given\n\nby\n\npr\n\nxi (T j + (T )) = \u03b4pi j .\nIn particular, the algebra Dist(Ga(r) ) = k[x1 , . . . , xr ] is generated by the xi . Owing to [51, (6.8)],\nthe support variety of M is homeomorphic to the rank variety\nVr (G)M := {\u03c6 : Ga(r) \u2212\u2192 G | M |Ar is not projective}.\nHere M |Ar denotes the pull-back of the module structure of M along the restriction to Ar := k[xr\u22121 ]\nof the homomorphism Dist(Ga(r) ) \u2212\u2192 Dist(Gr ) corresponding to \u03c6. In [51] the authors consider\nthe support scheme Vr (G)M , whose k-rational points are our variety Vr (G)M .\nBy general theory, the category of mod Gr of Gr -modules is equivalent to the module category\nmod Dist(Gr ) of the Hopf algebra Dist(Gr ) of distributions of Gr , see [35, I, \u00a78]. According to [12,\n(II, \u00a77, 4.2)], the Hopf algebra Dist(G1 ) is isomorphic to the restricted enveloping algebra U0 (g) of\nthe restricted Lie algebra g = Lie(G) of G. This isomorphism induces an isomorphism between\nVG1 (M ) and the corresponding variety Vg(M ) of the g-module associated to M . We shall henceforth\nidentify these two varieties without further notice.\nAccording to [51, (5.4)], a closed embedding H \u0592\u2192 H \u2032 of infinitesimal group schemes gives rise\nto an embedding VH (k) \u0592\u2192 VH \u2032 (k) that maps VH (k) homeomorphically onto its image. We use this\nidentification and write\nVH (M ) = VH \u2032 (M ) \u2229 VH (k)\n\u2032\nfor an H -module M . For future reference we record the following well-known fact concerning\nvarieties of relatively projective modules, see for instance [41, (2.3.1)].\n\n\f4\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nProposition 1.1. Let H \u2286 H \u2032 be infinitesimal group schemes.\n(1) If M is a (Dist(H \u2032 ) : Dist(H))-projective H-module, then VH \u2032 (M ) = VH (M ).\n(2) If N is an H-module, then VH \u2032 (Dist(H \u2032 )\u2297Dist(H) N ) \u2286 VH (N ).\n(3) A Dist(H)-module M is projective if and only if VH (M ) = {0}.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe let\nX(T )+ := {\u03bb \u2208 X(T ) | h\u03bb, \u03b1\u2228 i \u2265 0 \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3}\nbe the set of dominant weights and recall that for every \u03bb \u2208 X(T )+ there exists a simple Gmodule L(\u03bb) of highest weight \u03bb. Moreover, the L(\u03bb) form a complete set of representatives for the\nisoclasses of the simple G-modules. Similarly, the simple Gr -modules are of the form Lr (\u03bb), with\n\u03bb belonging to a set of representatives for X(T )/pr X(T ) (cf. [35, (II.3.10)]). Finally, the simple\nbr (\u03bb), with \u03bb \u2208 X(T ). Note that L\nb r (\u03bb)|Gr \u223c\nGr T -modules are given by L\n= Lr (\u03bb) (see [35, (II.9.6)]).\nGiven \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) and r \u2208 N, we let\nZr (\u03bb) := Dist(Gr )\u2297Dist(Br ) k\u03bb\nbe the (baby) Verma module of Gr with highest weight \u03bb.1 For a Levi subgroup L \u2287 T of G we\ndefine the (baby) Verma module of Lr with highest weight \u03bb by\nZrL (\u03bb) := Dist(Lr )\u2297Dist((B\u2229L)r ) k\u03bb .\nWe record the following basic result concerning varieties (cf. [41, (2.3.1),(4.2.1)]):\n\nProposition 1.2. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ).

The \"dot\" action of w \u2208 Wp on X(T ) is defined as follows:\nw.\u03bb := w(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1.\nLet H be an infinitesimal group scheme, M be an H-module. By definition, the complexity cxH (M )\nof M is the polynomial rate of growth of a minimal projective resolution (Pi )i\u22650 of M , i.e.,\ncxH (M ) := min{n \u2208 N0 \u222a {\u221e} | \u2203 c > 0 dimk Pi \u2264 cin\u22121 for all i \u2265 1}.\nThe reader is referred to [4, (5.3)] for basic properties of this notion.\nLet h = h(G) denote the Coxeter number of G, that is, the maximum of the Coxeter numbers\nof the simple components of the derived group (G, G).\nRecall that a prime p is said to be good for G, provided it does not divide any of the coefficients\noccurring when expressing any root of G as a linear combination of simple roots.

In [35] our group B is denoted B + .\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n5\n\n2. Auslander-Reiten Components of Simple Gr -modules\nGiven a self-injective algebra \u039b, we denote by \u0393s (\u039b) the stable Auslander\u2013Reiten quiver of \u039b. By\ndefinition, the directed graph \u0393s (\u039b) has as vertices the non-projective indecomposable \u039b-modules\nand its arrows are defined via the so-called irreducible morphisms. We refer the interested reader to\n[2, Chap. VII] for further details. The AR-quiver is fitted with an automorphism \u03c4\u039b , the so-called\nAuslander\u2013Reiten translation. Since \u039b is self-injective, \u03c4\u039b coincides with the composite \u03a92\u039b \u25e6 \u03bd\u039b of\nthe square of the Heller translate \u03a9\u039b and the Nakayama functor \u03bd\u039b , cf. [2, (IV.3.7)].\nThe connected components of \u0393s (\u039b) are connected stable translation quivers. By work of Riedtmann [44, Struktursatz], the structure of such a quiver \u0398 is determined by a directed tree T\u0398 and\nan admissible group \u03a0 \u2286 Autk (Z[T\u0398 ]), giving rise to an isomorphism\n\u0398\u223c\n= Z[T\u0398 ]/\u03a0\nof stable translation quivers. The undirected tree T\u0304\u0398 of T\u0398 is uniquely determined by \u0398 and is\ncalled the tree class of \u0398. We refer the reader to [3, (4.15.6)] for further details. For group algebras\nof finite groups, the possible tree classes and admissible groups were first determined by Webb [55],\nwith refinements provided in [47, 42, 5, 6, 14].\nThroughout, G is assumed to be a connected smooth reductive algebraic group scheme. By work\nof Larson and Sweedler [40], every finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is a Frobenius algebra. Consequently, the algebra Dist(Gr ) is self-injective, so that the classes of projective and injective\nGr -modules coincide.\nFollowing Ringel [45], an indecomposable Gr -module M is called quasi-simple provided its isomorphism class [M ] lies at the end of a component of tree class A\u221e of the stable AR-quiver\n\u0393s (Gr ) associated to Dist(Gr ). Given \u03bb \u2208 X(T ), let Pr (\u03bb) denote the projective cover of the\nnon-projective simple Gr -module Lr (\u03bb) and let Htr (\u03bb) = Rad(Pr (\u03bb))/ Soc(Pr (\u03bb)) be its heart. We\nwrite Top(M ) := M/ Rad(M ) for the top of a Gr -module M .\nFor future reference we record the following basic property of the algebras of distributions (see\n[48, 30] for related work):\nLemma 2.1. The Hopf algebra Dist(Gr ) is symmetric.\nProof. According to [35, (I.9.7)], the smooth group scheme G acts on the space of right integrals\nr\nof Dist(Gr ) via the character g 7\u2192 det Ad(g)p \u22121 . Since G = (G, G)Z(G), cf. [31, (27.5)], this\ncharacter is trivial, proving that the modular function of the Hopf algebra Dist(Gr ) coincides with\nits counit. Consequently, Dist(Gr ) is symmetric, see [23, (1.5)] for more details.\n\u0003\nFor future reference, we reformulate parts of [17, (7.1)].\nLemma 2.2. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight. Then the following statements hold:\n(1) dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) 6= 1.\n(2) If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2, then the block B \u2286 Dist(Gr ) containing Lr (\u03bb) is Morita equivalent\nto a block of SL(2)r .\nProof. (1) This was shown in the second paragraph of [17, p.80].\n(2) This follows directly from [17, p.80].\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 2.3. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that Lr (\u03bb) is not projective.\n(1) If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) 6= 2, then Lr (\u03bb) is quasi-simple.\n(2) If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2, then either Lr (\u03bb) is quasi-simple or Lr (\u03bb) belongs to a component\nof type Z[\u00c312 ].\n\n\f6\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nProof. If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) \u2265 3, then, thanks to [18, (2.2)], the component \u0398 containing [Lr (\u03bb)] is\nisomorphic to Z[A\u221e ].\nAssuming \u0398 \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ], we show that the isoclass [Lr (\u03bb)] is located at an end of \u0398. Suppose\nthat Lr (\u03bb) is not quasi-simple. Since Dist(Gr ) is symmetric, [37, (1.5)] provides simple Dist(Gr )modules Lr (\u03bci ) 6\u223c\n= Lr (\u03bb) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n such that each projective cover Pr (\u03bci ) is uniserial, of length\nl(Pr (\u03bci )) = n + 2, with Top(Rad(Pr (\u03bci ))) \u223c\n= Lr (\u03bci\u22121 ), where \u03bc0 = \u03bb. By the same token, Lr (\u03bb)\nhas multiplicity 1 in Pr (\u03bci ) for each i.\nAssuming n \u2265 2, we thus have\ndimk Ext1Gr (Lr (\u03bc1 ), Lr (\u03bc2 )) = 0\n\nand\n\ndimk Ext1Gr (Lr (\u03bc2 ), Lr (\u03bc1 )) = 1,\n\nwhich contradicts [35, (II.9.19(2))]. Consequently, n = 1, so that l(Pr (\u03bc1 )) = 3. Owing to [35,\n(II.11.4)], the module Pr (\u03bc1 ) has a filtration by baby Verma modules. Since l(Pr (\u03bc1 )) = 3, one\nZr -filtration factor, Zr (\u03b3) say, is simple or projective. In view of [35, (II.11.8)], the factor Zr (\u03b3)\nis simple and projective, so that the block containing Lr (\u03bb) is simple and dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 0, a\ncontradiction.\nBy Lemma 2.2, the variety VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) is not one-dimensional and so the proof of part (1) is\ncomplete.\nSuppose that dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2 and that \u0398 \u223c\n6 Z[A\u221e ]. By Theorem 4.1 in [18] and [21], the\n=\ncomponent containing [Lr (\u03bb)] is of type Z[\u00c312 ].\n\u0003\n\nRemark. For r = 1, a simple Gr -module of complexity 2 belongs to a component of type Z[\u00c312 ], cf.\n[17, (5.2)]. By contrast, simple modules of complexity 2 may belong to components of type Z[A\u221e ],\nwhenever r \u2265 2 (cf. [21]).\nWe record an immediate consequence concerning the structure of the hearts of the principal indecomposable modules:\nCorollary 2.4. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that Lr (\u03bb) is not projective.\n(1) If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) 6= 2, then Htr (\u03bb) is indecomposable.\n(2) If dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2, then either Htr (\u03bb) is indecomposable or Htr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Lr (\u03bc) \u2295 Lr (\u03bc),\nwhere Lr (\u03bc) \u223c\n6 Lr (\u03bb).\n=\nProof. Owing to Lemma 2.1, the algebra Dist(Gr ) is symmetric, so that Soc(Pr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= Lr (\u03bb). Hence\n(0) \u2212\u2192 Rad(Pr (\u03bb)) \u2212\u2192 Pr (\u03bb) \u2295 Htr (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 Pr (\u03bb)/Lr (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 (0)\nis the standard almost split sequence originating in Rad(Pr (\u03bb)), see [2, (V.5.5)]. Since \u03a9Gr is\nan auto-equivalence of the stable module category of Dist(Gr ), [2, (IV.3.5)], it induces an automorphism of \u0393s (Gr ), [2, (X.1.9)]. Consequently, Lr (\u03bb) and Pr (\u03bb)/Lr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= \u03a9\u22121\nGr (Lr (\u03bb)) have the\nsame number of non-projective predecessors. If the component \u0398 containing Lr (\u03bb) is isomorphic to\nZ[A\u221e ], then the result thus follows from Theorem 2.3. Alternatively, dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2 and Lr (\u03bb)\nbelongs to a component of type Z[\u00c312 ]. Thus, [13, (IV.3.8.3)] implies that Htr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Lr (\u03bc) \u2295 Lr (\u03bc).\nThe assumption Lr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Lr (\u03bc) yields dimk Ext1Gr (Lr (\u03bb), Lr (\u03bb)) = 2. However, by Lemma 2.2, the\nblock containing Lr (\u03bb) is Morita equivalent to a block of Dist(SL(2)r ), and the simple modules of\nthe latter algebra are known to afford no non-trivial self-extensions (cf. [43, Thm.]).\n\u0003\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n7\n\nRemark. The exceptional case of decomposable hearts corresponds to those blocks Br (\u03bb) \u2286 Dist(Gr )\nthat have tame representation type. The reader is referred to [13, (I.4)] for background information\non representation type.\nSuppose that Htr (\u03bb) is decomposable. In light of [13, (IV.3.8.3)] and (2) of Corollary 2.4, the\nalgebra Br (\u03bb)/ Soc(Br (\u03bb)) is special biserial, and hence in particular tame or representation-finite\n(cf. [13, (II.3.1)]). Since Br (\u03bb) and Br (\u03bb)/ Soc(Br (\u03bb)) have the same non-projective indecomposable\nmodules, we conclude that Br (\u03bb) enjoys the same property. As dim VGr (Lr (\u03bb)) = 2, it follows that\nBr (\u03bb) is tame. Conversely, if Lr (\u03bb) belongs to a tame block Br (\u03bb) of Dist(Gr ), then Br (\u03bb) is Morita\nequivalent to a tame block of Dist(SL(2)1 ), [17, (7.1)]. Consequently, the component containing\nLr (\u03bb) is isomorphic to Z[\u00c312 ] and Htr (\u03bb) is decomposable.\nThe final result of this section shows that, provided G is defined over Fp , every AR-component\ncontains at most one simple module. The technical hypothesis on the derived subgroup (G, G) of\nG will later be removed by means of covering techniques, see Theorem 3.6. Since G is defined over\nFp , we have the Frobenius endomorphism F : G \u2212\u2192 G, and for every G-module M , there is the\nFrobenius twist M [1] , obtained by composing the representation afforded by M with F (see [35,\n(II.3.16)]). For future reference, we record the following:\nLemma 2.5. Let \u0398 \u2286 \u0393s (Gr ) be a component which is isomorphic to Z[\u00c312 ]. Then \u0398 contains\nexactly one simple module.\n\u223c\nProof. According to [55, Thm.A] the component \u03a9\u22121\nGr (\u0398) = \u0398 is attached to a principal indecomposable module. In view of [2, (V.5.5)] and Lemma 2.1, there thus exists a simple Gr -module S\n\u22121\nsuch that [\u03a9\u22121\nGr (S)] \u2208 \u03a9Gr (\u0398). As a result, [S] \u2208 \u0398.\nCorollary 2.4 in conjunction with [13, (IV.3.8.3)] implies that the block of Dist(Gr ) containing\nS possesses two simple modules S and T , with\n(0) \u2212\u2192 Rad(P (S)) \u2212\u2192 P (S) \u2295 T \u2295 T \u2212\u2192 P (S)/S \u2212\u2192 (0)\nbeing the almost split sequence involving the projective cover P (S) of S. In particular, T belongs\nto the component \u03a9\u22121\nGr (\u0398). By virtue of [13, (IV.3.8.3)], we have \u0398 6= \u03a9Gr (\u0398), so that S is the only\nsimple module belonging to \u0398.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.6. Suppose that G is defined over Fp and that the derived subgroup (G, G) of G is\nsimply connected. If S is a simple, non-projective Gr -module, then [S] is the only simple vertex in\nits stable AR-component.\nProof. Let \u0398 \u2286 \u0393s (Gr ) be the stable AR-component containing the vertex [S]. According to\nTheorem 2.3, the component \u0398 is of type Z[A\u221e ] or Z[\u00c312 ]. In the latter case, the assertion follows\nfrom Lemma 2.5.\nAssuming \u0398 \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ], we proceed by induction on r. If r = 1, then [16, (4.1)] proves our claim.\nNow assume that r \u2265 2 and let T \u223c\n6 S be another simple Gr -module which belongs to \u0398. According\n=\nto Theorem 2.3, S and T lie at the end of \u0398. Thanks to Lemma 2.1, the Auslander\u2013Reiten translate\nof \u0393s (Gr ) coincides with \u03a92Gr . Without loss of generality, there thus exists n \u2208 N with\n(2.7)\n\nT \u223c\n= \u03a92n\nGr (S).\n\nAs (G, G) is simply connected, each element \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) can be written as \u03bb = \u03bb0 + pr \u03bb1 , with\n\u03bb0 \u2208 Xr (T ) and \u03bb1 \u2208 X(T ) (cf. [35, (II.9.14)]). Consequently, Xr (T ) contains a complete set of\nrepresentatives for X(T )/pr X(T ), and there exist \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 Xr (T ) such that S = Lr (\u03bb), T = Lr (\u03bc),\nwith both modules being restrictions of simple G-modules, see [35, (II.3.15)]. By the same token,\n\n\f8\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nthere are decompositions \u03bc = \u03bc0 + p\u03bc1 and \u03bb = \u03bb0 + p\u03bb1 , where \u03bc0 , \u03bb0 \u2208 X1 (T ) and \u03bc1 , \u03bb1 \u2208\nXr\u22121 (T ). In view of [35, (II.3.16)], we thus have\nLr (\u03bc) \u223c\n= L1 (\u03bc0 )\u2297k Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )[1] and Lr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k Lr\u22121 (\u03bb1 )[1] ,\nso that\nLr (\u03bc)|G1 = m\u03bc L1 (\u03bc0 ) and Lr (\u03bb)|G1 = m\u03bb L1 (\u03bb0 ).\nIdentity (2.7) in conjunction with standard properties of the Heller operator now yields:\n(2.8)\nm\u03bc L1 (\u03bc0 ) \u223c\n= m\u03bb \u03a92n\nG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 )) \u2295 (proj.).\nIn particular, the indecomposable G1 -module \u03a92n\nG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 )) (cf. [29]) is a direct summand of L1 (\u03bc0 ).\nConsequently, [3, (2.5.4)] gives\ndimk Ext2n\nG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 ), L1 (\u03bb0 )) \u2264 dimk HomG1 (L1 (\u03bc0 ), L1 (\u03bb0 )) \u2264 1.\nOwing to [15, (2.1)], this implies cxG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 )) \u2264 1, which, in view of G being reductive, entails the\nprojectivity of L1 (\u03bb0 ), see [16, (3.1)]. By (2.8), the simple G1 -module L1 (\u03bc0 ) also has this property.\nLet eS , eT \u2208 Dist(G1 ) be the primitive central idempotents defining the simple blocks containing\nS|G1 and T |G1 , respectively. Since these are fixed by the adjoint representation of the connected\ngroup G, it follows that eS , eT are also central idempotents of Dist(Gr ) \u2287 Dist(G1 ) (see [35,\n(II.10.3)] for more details). As S and T belong to the same block of Dist(Gr ), the idempotents\neS and eT act via the identity on S and T . Consequently, eS = eT , so that the simple projective\nG1 -modules L1 (\u03bb0 ) and L1 (\u03bc0 ) belong to the same block, whence HomG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 ), L1 (\u03bc0 )) = k. Let\n\u03b3 \u2208 X(G) be the character giving the action of G on HomG1 (L1 (\u03bb0 ), L1 (\u03bc0 )). There results an\nisomorphism\nL1 (\u03bc0 ) \u223c\n= L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k k\u03b3\nof Gr -modules. As a result, we have\n\u223c L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )[1] \u2297k k\u2212\u03b3 .\nT =\nSince G1 \u2286 ker \u03b3, it follows that \u03b3 \u2208 pX(G) (cf. [35, (II.1.18,II.3.7)]), so that the last two tensor\nfactors are the Frobenius twist of Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )\u2297k k\u03c9 , for some \u03c9 \u2208 X(G).\nOwing to [35, (II.10.5)], the functor\nM 7\u2192 L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k M [1]\ninduces an equivalence between mod Gr\u22121 and the sum of those blocks of mod Gr given by eS . As\na result, the modules Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )\u2297kk\u03c9 and Lr\u22121 (\u03bb1 ) belong to the same component of \u0393s (Gr\u22121 ). The\ninductive hypothesis now provides an isomorphism Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )\u2297k k\u03c9 \u223c\n= Lr\u22121 (\u03bb1 ) of Gr\u22121 -modules, so\nthat\nT \u223c\n= S,\n= L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k Lr\u22121 (\u03bb1 )[1] \u223c\n= L1 (\u03bb0 )\u2297k (Lr\u22121 (\u03bc1 )\u2297k k\u03c9 )[1] \u223c\na contradiction.\n\u0003\n3. Auslander-Reiten Theory for mod Gr T\nLet G be a connected, reductive, smooth group scheme with maximal torus T and character group\nX(T ). Given \u03bb \u2208 X(T ), we denote by \u0398r (\u03bb) the connected component of the stable Auslander\u2013\nReiten quiver \u0393s (Gr ) of Dist(Gr ) containing the isoclass [Zr (\u03bb)]. Our main tool in this section is\ncovering theory, appearing in the guise of Jantzen's category mod Gr T of Gr T -modules (cf. [32,\n\u00a72]). It turns out that certain properties of \u0398r (\u03bb) can be effectively studied by first investigating the\ncorresponding properties for components of the stable Auslander\u2013Reiten quiver of the Frobenius\ncategory mod Gr T . In view of the conjugacy of maximal tori, our considerations do not depend\non the choice of T . The category mod Gr T is a highest weight category in the sense of [10], whose\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n9\n\nbr (\u03bb), where \u03bb \u2208 X(T ).

The T -action\nis induced by the adjoint action of T on Dist(Gr ) (cf. [35, \u00a7II.9]).\nWe shall consider the full subcategory F(\u2206) of mod Gr T of Zbr -filtered Gr T -modules. Given\nM \u2208 F(\u2206), its filtration multiplicities\n[M : Zbr (\u03bb)]\nare well-defined (cf. [35, (II.11.2)]). We define the \u2206-support of M \u2208 F(\u2206) via\nsupp\u2206 (M ) := {\u03bb \u2208 X(T ) | [M : Zbr (\u03bb)] 6= 0}.\n\nThe objects of F(\u2206) are usually referred to as \u2206-good modules.\n\nGiven \u03bb \u2208 X(T ), we write X(T )\u2265\u03bb := {\u03bc \u2208 X(T ) | \u03bc \u2265 \u03bb} as well as X(T )>\u03bb := {\u03bc \u2208 X(T ) | \u03bc >\n\u03bb}.\nb r (\u03bb) with projective cover\nRecall that for every \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) there exists a unique simple object L\nb\nPr (\u03bb), and that all simple and projective indecomposable objects are of this form (see [35, (II.9.6),\n(II.11.5.(3))]). In view of [35, (II.11.4)], the module Pbr (\u03bb) belongs to F(\u2206), with its filtration\nmultiplicities obeying the BGG reciprocity formula\nbr (\u03bb)].\n[Pbr (\u03bb) : Zbr (\u03bc)] = [Zbr (\u03bc) : L\n\nIn particular, the highest weights of the Zbr -filtration factors of Pbr (\u03bb) enjoy the following property:\nLemma 3.1. We have\nfor every \u03bb \u2208 X(T ).\n\nsupp\u2206 (Pbr (\u03bb)) \u2286 X(T )\u2265\u03bb\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the sequel, we shall study mod Gr T as well as mod(Gr \u22ca T ). The latter category coincides\nwith the category modX(T ) Dist(Gr ) of X(T )-graded Gr -modules and degree zero homomorphisms.\nWe identify X(T ) with the subgroup of those characters \u03bb \u2208 X(Gr \u22ca T ) that are trivial on Gr .\nThus, every \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) defines a one-dimensional (Gr \u22ca T )-module k\u03bb . It now follows directly\nfrom the definition that the shift functor M 7\u2192 M h\u03bbi of modX(T ) Dist(Gr ) corresponds to the\nauto-equivalence M 7\u2192 M \u2297k k\u03bb .\nSince Gr T \u223c\n= (Gr \u22ca T )/Tr , the shifts sending mod Gr T onto itself are given by those \u03bb \u2208 X(T )\nthat vanish on Tr .

Thus,\nmod Gr T is a Frobenius category (cf. [28, (I.2)]), and we can speak of the stable Auslander\u2013Reiten\nquiver \u0393s (Gr T ) of Gr T . In view of Lemma 3.2(3), the functor F commutes with the Auslander\u2013\nReiten translations \u03c4Gr T and \u03c4Gr of \u0393s (Gr T ) and \u0393s (Gr ), that is,\n\u03c4 Gr \u25e6 F = F \u25e6 \u03c4 Gr T .\nWe record the analogue of [19, (2.2)]:\nLemma 3.3. The following statements hold:\n(1) The canonical restriction functor F : mod Gr T \u2212\u2192 mod Gr induces a morphism F :\n\u0393s (Gr T ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393s (Gr ) of stable translation quivers that maps the set x+ of successors of an arbitrary vertex x \u2208 \u0393s (Gr T ) onto the set of successors F(x)+ of F(x).\n(2) If \u0398 \u2286 \u0393s (Gr T ) is a component, then F(\u0398) is a component of \u0393s (Gr ).\n\u0003\nBy work of Gordon and Green [27, \u00a71,\u00a73], the Auslander\u2013Reiten translation \u03c4Gr T = \u03c4Gr \u22caT |mod Gr T\nis given by\n\u03c4Gr T (M ) = Tr(M )\u2217 ,\nwhere Tr(M ) denotes the transpose of M (see [2, (IV.1)] for the definition). In view of mod Gr T\nbeing Frobenius, we have natural isomorphisms\nTr(M )\u2217 \u223c\n= N (\u03a92 (M )),\nGr T\n\n))\u2217\n\nwhere N = HomGr (\u2212, Dist(Gr\nis the Nakayama functor of mod Gr T . According to [35, (I.9.7)],\nr\nthe group G acts via the character g 7\u2192 det(Ad(g))p \u22121 on the space of left integrals of Dist(Gr ).\nThe reductivity of G implies that this character is trivial, and we obtain N \u223c\n= idmod Gr T , cf. [35,\n(I.8.12)] and [21]. As a result, we have\n\u03c4G T (M ) \u223c\n= \u03a92 (M )\nr\n\nGr T\n\nfor every Gr T -module M .\nReplacing U0 (g) by Dist(Gr ) in [19, (2.3)] while observing [18, (1.3)], one obtains:\nProposition 3.4.

Given a\nconnected smooth reductive group scheme G, a connected smooth reductive group scheme G\u0303 is\ncalled a covering of G if there exists a finite diagonalizable subgroup scheme Z\u0303 \u2286 G\u0303 such that\nG\u0303/Z\u0303 \u223c\n= G (cf.

Owing to [35, (II.9.7)], we have (G\u0303r T\u0303 )/Z\u0303 \u223c\n= Gr T . By rigidity of tori (cf. [53, (7.7)]), the\ngroup Z\u0303 belongs to the center of G\u0303. Thus, Z\u0303 acts on each module of a block of mod G\u0303r T\u0303 via the\nsame character (cf. [35, (II.7.1)]), and our assertion follows.\n\u0003\nRecall that an indecomposable module M of a self-injective algebra \u039b is periodic, if there exists\n\u223c\nm \u2208 N such that \u03a9m\n\u039b (M ) = M . Periodic modules have complexity 1. It thus follows from Lemma\n2.2 that the simple Gr -modules Lr (\u03bb) are not periodic.\nThe foregoing result enables us to generalize Theorem 2.6 to arbitrary reductive groups:\nTheorem 3.6. Suppose that G is defined over Fp and let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ).\nbr (\u03bb) is the\n(1) If the component \u0398 \u2286 \u0393s (Gr ) containing Lr (\u03bb) is isomorphic to Z[A\u221e ], then L\nonly simple vertex in its AR-component.\n(2) The module Lr (\u03bb) is the only simple vertex in its AR-component.\nProof. (1) General theory ensures the existence of a covering G\u0303 such that (G\u0303, G\u0303) is simply connected.\nIn view of Lemma 3.5, we may thus assume without loss of generality that the derived group (G, G)\nof G is simply connected.\nb r (\u03bb\u2032 ) also belongs to the component \u0398\nb of \u0393s (Gr T ) containing L\nbr (\u03bb).

Auslander-Reiten Components of Verma Modules\nGiven a component \u0398 \u2286 \u0393s (Gr ), we recall that any two vertices of \u0398 have the same rank variety\nVr (G)\u0398 (cf. [18, (1.1)]). The quiver \u0393s (Gr ) is known to satisfy an analogue of Webb's Theorem [55]\nfor finite groups, that is, the tree classes of the components of \u0393s (Gr ) are finite or infinite Dynkin\ndiagrams, or Euclidean diagrams (cf. [18, (1.3)]). Our next lemma further reduces the possibilities\nfor the components \u0398r (\u03bb) containing the isoclasses [Zr (\u03bb)].\nThe group G acts on Gr via conjugation. This action induces operations on Vr (G) and Dist(Gr ),\nwhere we denote the automorphism of Dist(Gr ) corresponding to g by Ad(g). Letting M (g) be the\npull-back of a Gr -module M along Ad(g)\u22121 , we obtain actions of G on mod Gr and \u0393s (Gr ) via\nauto-equivalences and isomorphisms of stable representation quivers, respectively. Note that\nVr (G)M (g) = g.Vr (G)M\n\n\u2200 g \u2208 G.\n\nSince G is connected, the isoclasses of the simple Gr -modules are fixed by the above action, so that\nthe rank varieties of these modules are G-stable subsets of Vr (G).\nA component of \u0393s (Gr ) is regular if it is not attached to a principal indecomposable module.\n\nLemma 4.1. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that Zr (\u03bb) is not projective. Then the following\nstatements hold:\n(1) The component \u0398r (\u03bb) is regular.\n(2) The isoclass [Zr (\u03bb)] is a vertex of \u0398r (\u03bb) of minimal dimension.\nn\n(3) If dim Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) = 1, then \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ]/(\u03c4 p ) for some n \u2208 {0, . . . , r \u2212 1}.\n(4) If dim Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) \u2265 2, then \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ], Z[D\u221e ], or Z[A\u221e\n\u221e ].\nProof. Thanks to [50, (1.5,1.14)] and [51, (5.2)], there is a commutative diagram\n\u03a8\n\nVr (U ) \u2212\u2212\u2212U\u2212\u2192 VUr (k)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03b9y\nresy\n\u03a8\n\nVr (G) \u2212\u2212\u2212G\u2212\u2192 VGr (k),\n\nwhere \u03b9 is injective and the horizontal arrows are homeomorphisms. Owing to Proposition 1.2 we\nhave VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u2286 im res. Thus, [51, (6.8)] gives Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) \u2286 Vr (U ).\nLet g0 \u2208 G be a representative of the longest element w0 of the Weyl group W of G, so that\ng0 U g0\u22121 = U \u2212 , cf. [35, (II.1.8)]. For any non-trivial element \u03c6 \u2208 Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) \u2286 Vr (U ), we have\ng0 .\u03c6 \u2208 Vr (U \u2212 ), so that g0 .\u03c6 6\u2208 Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) . Thus, Vr (G)\u0398r (\u03bb) is not G-invariant.\n(1) Since rank varieties of non-regular components are necessarily G-invariant (cf. [17, \u00a77]),\nassertion (1) follows.\n(2) This is a direct consequence of Theorem 3.7(3).\n(3) A consecutive application of [18, (2.1)] and [18, (4.1)] shows that \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ]/(\u03c4 m ) for\nsome m \u2208 N. According to Lemma 2.1, Dist(Gr ) is a symmetric algebra, so that \u03c4Gr = \u03a92Gr . The\nFriedlander-Suslin Theorem [25, (1.5)] shows that the even cohomology ring H\u2022 (Gr , k) is a finitely\ngenerated module of a graded subalgebra, whose generators have degree 2pi for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1.\nThanks to [4, (5.10.6)], the periods of the periodic modules are divisors of these numbers. This\nimplies our assertion concerning n.\n(4) Suppose that assertion (4) does not hold. The classification of AR-components (cf. [18, (4.1)])\nnow implies that \u0398r (\u03bb) is a Euclidean component. As such, it is not regular, contradicting part\n(1).\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G.

Aside from simple modules and baby Verma modules, the so-called Weyl modules V (\u03bb)\n(see [35, (II.2.13)]) and their duals form another important class of Gr -modules. For the group\nscheme SL(2)1 , these modules belong to components of type Z[\u00c312 ], cf. [20, (4.3.1)]. Since the\nsupport varieties of Weyl modules are G-invariant, they will in general have dimension \u2265 3, so that\n[18, (2.2)] ensures that Weyl modules usually belong to components of type Z[A\u221e ]. However, their\nposition within these components is not known.\n\n5. Varieties for Verma Modules\nWe begin by generalizing [22, (2.3)] to Verma modules of higher Frobenius kernels. Recall that\nh is the Coxeter number of the reductive group G. Unless mentioned otherwise, the prime p is\nassumed to be good for G.\nThe interested reader may compare the following result with [41, (4.1.2)]. Under the additional\nhypothesis of VUr (k) being irreducible, the implication (3) \u21d2 (1) provides the converse to part (b)\nof that result. Also note that the assumption p \u2265 h implies that VU1 (k) is irreducible.\nLemma 5.1. Suppose p \u2265 h and that VUr (k) is irreducible. Let r \u2264 s and \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight.\nThen the following statements are equivalent:\n(1) VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) = VUr (k).\n(2) cxGr (Zs (\u03bb)) = dim VUr (k).\n(3) \u03bb is p-regular.\nProof. (1) \u21d2 (2). Thanks to [25, (1.5.2)] the cohomology ring Hev (Gr , k) is finitely generated.\nThus, the arguments of [8, (2.3)] show that the complexity of the Gr -module Zs (\u03bb) coincides with\nthe dimension of VGr (Zs (\u03bb)).\n(2) \u21d2 (3). The Gr T -module Zbs (\u03bb) is Br\u2212 -projective, and [35, (II.11.2)] provides a Zbr -filtration\nof Zbs (\u03bb)|Gr T . Applying the exact functor F, we conclude that Zs (\u03bb)|Gr has a Zr -filtration, so that\nProposition 1.2 gives\nVGr (Zs (\u03bb)) \u2286 VUr (k)\nfor any \u03bb \u2208 X(T ). Since the variety VUr (k) is irreducible, (2) implies that the above inclusion is in\nfact an equality. In view of [41, (4.1.2)], we obtain the p-regularity of \u03bb.\n(3) \u21d2 (1). Following the proof of [22, (2.3)], we first consider the case where \u03bb = 0. The\naugmentation map \u03b5 : Dist(Gr ) \u2212\u2192 k furnishes a split surjective homomorphism\nf : Zs (0) \u2212\u2192 k ; u \u2297 \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03b5(u)\u03b1\nof Dist(Ur )-modules. Thus, k is a direct summand of Zs (0)|Ur , so that VUr (k) \u2286 VUr (Zs (0)). The\nforegoing observations now yield\nVGr (Zs (0)) = VUr (k).\n\n\f18\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nTo transfer this result to other p-regular weights, we shall use translation functors T\u03bb\u03bc , cf. [35,\n(II.9.22)]. Their definition in conjuction with [51, (7.2)], yields\nVGr (T\u03bb\u03bc (M )) \u2286 VGr (M ).\nNow let \u03bb be another weight in the standard alcove\nC0 := {\u03bb \u2208 X(T )\u2297Z R | 0 < h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1\u2228 i < p\n\n\u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8+ }\n\n(such weights are necessarily p-regular). The translation functor T0\u03bb provides a categorical equivalence between the blocks of Dist(Gr ) associated to \u03bb and 0 and sends Zs (0) onto Zs (\u03bb) (cf. [35,\n(II.9.22(1)-(3))]). Consequently, the Gr -support varieties of Zs (\u03bb) and Zs (0) are equal.\nBy the same token, VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) and VGr (Zs (\u03b3)) coincide, whenever \u03bb and \u03b3 are p-regular elements\nbelonging to the same alcove.\nLet C be an alcove such that VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) = VUr (k) for some (and hence every) p-regular element\n\u03bb \u2208 C. We choose an alcove D adjacent to C and let sF be the unique affine reflection relative\nto the adjoining wall F = C \u2229 D (facet of codimension 1). Note that sF .\u03bb \u2208 D is a p-regular\nelement. Next, we choose an element w \u2208 Wp such that w.C = C0 . Then w.D is adjacent to C0\nwith adjoining wall w.F and associated reflection s\u2032 = wsF w\u22121 . Observe that w\u22121 .s\u2032 .(w.\u03bb) = sF .\u03bb.\nNow let \u03bc \u2208 w.F be a weight on the wall w.F . Suppose that \u03bb < sF .\u03bb. An application of [35,\n(II.9.22(3))] provides an exact sequence\n(0) \u2212\u2192 Zs (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 T\u03bcw.\u03bb (Zs (w\u22121 .\u03bc)) \u2212\u2192 Zs (sF .\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 (0)\nof Gs -modules, so that\nVGr (Zs (\u03bb)) \u2286 VGr (T\u03bcw.\u03bb (Zs (w\u22121 .\u03bc))) \u222a VGr (Zs (sF .\u03bb)) \u2286 VGr (Zs (w\u22121 .\u03bc)) \u222a VGr (Zs (sF .\u03bb)).\nSince VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) = VUr (k) is irreducible and w\u22121 .\u03bc \u2208 w.F is not p-regular, we have VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) =\nVGr (Zs (sF .\u03bb)), cf. [41, (4.1.2)]. Therefore, VGr (Zs (\u03b3)) = VUr (k) for any p-regular element \u03b3 \u2208 D.\nThe case \u03bb > sF .\u03bb can be treated similarly.\nSince Wp acts transitively on the set of alcoves, we are done.\n\u0003\nWe shall use the foregoing result mainly for Levi subgroups defined by simple roots. The following\nexample provides another case, where VUr (k) is irreducible.\nExample. Suppose that p \u2265 3 and consider the group G = SL(3). We let U denote the unipotent\nsubgroup of upper triangular matrices. Then u := Lie(U ) is isomorphic to the 3-dimenisonal punipotent Heisenberg algebra with trivial p-map and multiplication relative to the standard basis\n{a, b, c} defined via\n[a, b] = c and [a, c] = 0 = [b, c].\nFor r \u2265 2 and any subspace v \u2286 u, we consider the commuting variety\nC r (v) := {(v0 , . . . , vr\u22121 ) \u2208 vr | [vi , vj ] = 0 for i 6= j}.\nWriting vj := xj a + yj b + zj c, we obtain\n(\u2217)\n\n[vi , vj ] = (xi yj \u2212 xj yi )c\n\nThus, for v := ka \u2295 kb, the variety C r (v) is defined by the determinantal ideal\nI2 (A) \u2286 k[X0 , . . . , Xr\u22121 , Y0 , . . . , Yr\u22121 ],\ngiven by the (2\u00d72)-minors of the (r\u00d7r)-matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX0 . . . Xr\u22121\nA :=\n.\nY0 . . . Yr\u22121\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n19\n\nThanks to [7, (7.3.1)], the determinantal variety C r (v) is irreducible.\nIn view of (\u2217), the isomorphism\nvr \u00d7 (kc)r \u2212\u2192 ur ; (v0 , . . . , vr\u22121 , w0 , . . . , wr\u22121 ) 7\u2192 (v0 + w0 , . . . , vr\u22121 + wr\u22121 )\nmaps the irreducible variety C r (v) \u00d7 (kc)r onto C r (u), so that C r (u) is also irreducible. By applying [50, (1.7),(1.8)] and [51, (5.2)] successively, we conclude that the support variety VUr (k) is\nirreducible. Owing to [7, (7.3.1)], we also have dim VUr (k) = 2r + 1.\nGiven a root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8, we let U\u03b1 \u2286 G denote the corresponding root subgroup, see [35, (II.1.2)].\nCorollary 5.2. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that \u03a8\u03bb 6= \u03a8. Given r \u2264 s, we have \u03a3\u2229(\u03a8\\\u03a8\u03bb ) 6= \u2205\nas well as\nV(U\u03b1 )r (k) \u2286 VGr (Zs (\u03bb))\n\u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 (\u03a8 \\ \u03a8\u03bb ).\nIn particular, cxGr (Zs (\u03bb)) \u2265 r.\nProof. Since \u03a8\u03bb \u2286 \u03a8 is a subsystem ([33, (2.7)]), there exists a simple root \u03b1 in \u03a8 \\ \u03a8\u03bb . Given\nsuch a root \u03b1, we let L \u2287 T be the Levi subgroup of G defined by \u03b1. Thanks to Proposition 1.2,\nthe variety VGs (Zs (\u03bb)) contains VLs (ZsL (\u03bb)), so that\nVLr (ZsL (\u03bb)) \u2286 VGr (Zs (\u03bb)).\nBy assumption, the weight \u03bb is p-regular on L. Observe that the root group U\u03b1 is the unipotent\nradical of the Borel subgroup B \u2229 L of L. Moreover, U\u03b1 is isomorphic to the additive group\nGa \u223c\n= Speck (k[T ]). Accordingly, we have (U\u03b1 )r \u223c\n= Ga(r) , whence\nV(U\u03b1 )r (k) \u223c\n= VGa(r) (k) \u223c\n= kr\nis irreducible, see [11, (4.1)]. Consequently, Lemma 5.1 yields VLr (ZsL (\u03bb)) = V(U\u03b1 )r (k), whence\nV(U\u03b1 )r (k) \u2286 VGr (Zs (\u03bb)) and cxGr (Zs (\u03bb)) \u2265 dim V(U\u03b1 )r (k) = r.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.3. Suppose that p \u2265 5. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that\n(a) \u03a8\u03bb 6= \u03a8, and\n(b) cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = r.\nThen there exists a simple root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3 such that VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = V(U\u03b1 )r (k) is irreducible.\nProof. According to Corollary 5.2, we can find a simple root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8 such that the r-dimensional\nirreducible variety V(U\u03b1 )r (k) is contained in VGr (Zr (\u03bb)). By the arguments of Lemma 4.1, this\nimplies\nVr (U\u03b1 ) \u2286 Vr (G)Zr (\u03bb) .\nIn view of (b), the rank variety Vr (U\u03b1 ) is an irreducible component of the B-invariant variety\nVr (G)Zr (\u03bb) . Thus, the stabilizer H \u2286 B of Vr (U\u03b1 ) is a closed subgroup of finite index, and the\nconnectedness of B gives H = B, so that the variety Vr (U\u03b1 ) is also B-invariant. In particular,\n\u223c\nthe B-orbit of the canonical isomorphism Ga(r) \u2212\u2192 (U\u03b1 )r is contained in Vr (U\u03b1 ), implying the\nB-invariance of (U\u03b1 )r \u2286 Br . Thus, g\u03b1 = Lie((U\u03b1 )r ) enjoys the same property, and the proof of [22,\n(3.3)] provides a decomposition G = SH of G as an almost direct product with\n(1) g\u03b1 \u2286 Lie(S), and\n(2) S is almost simple of type A1 , and\n(3) g = Lie(S) \u2295 Lie(H).\n\n\f20\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nIn view of (3), we have (S \u2229 H)1 \u2286 Cent(S)1 = ek , so that (S \u2229 H)r = ek . Thus, the canonical map\nS \u00d7 H \u2212\u2192 G induces a closed embedding Sr \u00d7 Hr \u0592\u2192 Gr .

Thanks to [35, (II.11.8)], this implies that Zr (\u03bb0 ) is a simple\nprojective module and Br (\u03bb0 ) = \u03bb0 + pr X(T ). Thus, Proposition 5.4 in conjunction with [35,\n(II.3.7.(9))] provides a filtration of Zs (\u03bb)|Gr with Zr (\u03bb0 ) being the only filtration factor.

If\nB is not a simple block, then [35, (II.11.16(b))] and [35, (II.11.10),(II.11.11)] in conjunction with\nSL(2)1 -theory imply that the dimensions of the principal indecomposable B-modules are even. As\ndimk ZsL (\u03bb) = ps , we have reached a contradiction.

Since \u03a8r\u03bb is a\nsubsystem of \u03a8 ([33, (2.7)]), we conclude that \u03a8 = \u03a8r\u03bb , as desired.\n\u0003\n\n6.

An application of the d-th power of the Frobenius endomorphism gives\n\u2212\nF d (x)S = F d (xS ) = F d (a)F d (b) = F d (b) \u2208 Ur\u2212d (S) \u2229 Br\u2212d\n(S) = {1}.\n\nIn view of [53, (15.6)], we also have F d (x) = 1, whence x \u2208 Ud (R). Thus, H \u2229 Ur \u2286 Ud implying\nVr (H \u2229 Ur )Z (\u03bb) \u2286 Vr (Ud )Z (\u03bb) \u2286 Vr (Gd )Z (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Vd (Gd )Z (\u03bb) ,\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nwhere the last isomorphism is obtained by restricting the canonical identification Vd (Gd ) \u2212\u2192\nVr (Gd ) ; \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u25e6 F r\u2212d . In view of Corollary 5.6, the right-hand variety is trivial, proving\nthat Vr (H)Zr (\u03bb) = Vr (H \u2229 Ur )Zr (\u03bb) = {0}. As a result, the module Zr (\u03bb)|H is projective.\nOwing to [35, (I.9.5)], the Frobenius homomorphism F d induces an isomorphism Gr T /Gd \u223c\n=\n\u2212\nGr\u2212d T . Consequently, M = N [d] for some Gr\u2212d T -module N . Moreover, N is a projective Br\u2212d\nmodule if and only if M is a projective H/Gd -module. By [35, (II.10.4)], the functor X 7\u2192 X\u2297k Std\ngives rise to an equivalence between mod Dist(H/Gd ) and mod Dist(H)ed , sending M to Zr (\u03bb).\n\u2212\n-projectivity of N . According to [35,\nSince Zr (\u03bb) is a projective H-module, we conclude the Br\u2212d\n(II.11.2)], the Gr\u2212d T -module N therefore affords a filtration by baby Verma modules. Thus, for\ndimension reasons, we have N \u223c\n= Zr\u2212d (\u03bd) for some \u03bd \u2208 X(T ).\nSince\nbr\u2212d (\u03bd)[d] )\u2297k F(Std ) \u223c\nF(Zbr\u2212d (\u03bd)[d] \u2297k Std ) \u223c\n= F(Z\n= Zr\u2212d (\u03bd)[d] \u2297k Std \u223c\n= Zr (\u03bb),\nit follows from [26, (4.1)] that there exists \u03b3 \u2208 X(T ) such that\nbr (\u03bb) \u223c\nbr\u2212d (\u03bd)[d] \u2297k Std \u2297k kpr \u03b3 \u223c\nbr\u2212d (\u03bd + pr\u2212d \u03b3)[d] \u2297k Std .\nZ\n=Z\n=Z\n\nA comparison of highest weight vectors gives \u03bb = pd \u03bd + pr \u03b3 + (pd \u2212 1)\u03c1.

This completes the proof of\n(a). Part (b) is now a direct consequence of Proposition 6.1.\n\u0003\n\nExample. We consider the semi-simple, simply connected group G = SL(2). If \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) is a weight\nwith dp(\u03bb) \u2264 r, then\nVSL(2) (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= kr+1\u2212dp(\u03bb) .\nr\n\nIf dp(\u03bb) = 1, then our assertion follows directly from Corollary 5.2. Alternatively, Theorem 6.2\nreduces us to this case.\n\nCorollary 6.3. Let p \u2265 h and suppose that G is semi-simple and simply connected. Let \u03bb \u2208\nX(T ) be a weight of depth dp(\u03bb) \u2264 r such that VUr+1\u2212dp(\u03bb) (k) is irreducible. Then VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n=\nVUr+1\u2212dp(\u03bb) (k) if and only if \u03bb is pdp(\u03bb) -regular.\nProof. Thanks to Theorem 6.2, there exists a weight \u03bc \u2208 X(T ) of depth 1 and isomorphisms\nZr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Zr\u2212d (\u03bc)[d] \u2297k Std and VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= VGr\u2212d (Zr\u2212d (\u03bc))\nof modules and varieties, respectively. According to Lemma 5.1, the condition VGr\u2212d (Zr\u2212d (\u03bc)) \u223c\n=\nVUr\u2212d (k) is equivalent to \u03bc being p-regular. Since \u03bb = pd \u03bc + (pd \u2212 1)\u03c1, this happens precisely when\n\u03bb is pdp(\u03bb) -regular.\n\u0003\n\nExample. Consider the semi-simple, simply connected group G = SL(3). If \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) has depth\ndp(\u03bb) \u2264 r and \u03bb is pdp(\u03bb) -regular, then the example following Lemma 5.1 in conjunction with\nCorollary 6.3 implies VSL(3)r (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= VUr+1\u2212dp(\u03bb) (k) as well as cxSL(3)r (Zr (\u03bb)) = 2(r \u2212 dp(\u03bb)) + 3.\n\nCorollary 6.4. Let p \u2265 h and suppose that G is semi-simple and simply connected. Let \u03bb \u2208 X(T )\nbe a weight of depth dp(\u03bb) = r. Then VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n\u0003\n= VU1 (k) if and only if \u03bb is pr -regular.\n\nCorollary 6.5. Suppose that G is semi-simple, simply connected and of characteristic p \u2265 5. Let\n\u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = r + 1 \u2212 dp(\u03bb). Then there exists a simple root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8\nsuch that VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= V(U\u03b1 )r+1\u2212dp(\u03bb) (k) is irreducible.\nProof. As before, we write dp(\u03bb) = d + 1. If dp(\u03bb) = 1, then the result follows directly from\nCorollary 5.3. Alternatively, Theorem 6.2(b) provides a weight \u03bc of depth 1 and an isomorphism\nVGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= VGr\u2212d (Zr\u2212d (\u03bc)), so that another application of Corollary 5.3 completes the proof. \u0003\nThe following result reduces questions concerning AR-components of Verma modules to those,\nwhose defining weights have depth 1.

In view of Corollary 5.2, our statement holds for d = 0. We therefore assume that d \u2265 1.\nProceeding in several steps, we first prove our result under the assumption:\n(i) G is semi-simple and simply connected.\nOwing to Theorem 6.2, there exists a weight \u03bc \u2208 X(T ) such that dp(\u03bc) = 1 and\nbr (\u03bb) \u223c\nbr\u2212d (\u03bc)[d] \u2297k Std .\nZ\n=Z\n\nLetting ed \u2208 Dist(Gd ) \u2286 Dist(Gr ) be the primitive idempotent belonging to Std , we denote by\nmod Gr T ed the full subcategory of mod Gr T , consisting of those Gr T -modules M satisfying ed M =\nM . In view of [35, (II.10.4)], mod Gr T ed is a sum of blocks of mod Gr T .\nSince the Frobenius endomorphism F d induces an isomorphism Gr T /Gd \u223c\n= Gr\u2212d T , an application\nof [35, (II.10.4/5)] shows that the restriction of the functor\n\u03a6 : mod Gr T \u2212\u2192 mod Gr\u2212d T ; M 7\u2192 HomGd (Std , M )[\u2212d]\nto mod Gr T ed is an equivalence of categories. As such, \u03a6 induces an isomorphism between the\nstable Auslander\u2013Reiten quivers \u0393s (mod Gr T ed ) and \u0393s (Gr\u2212d T ), sending the class of the module\nbr\u2212d (\u03bc). Since mod Gr T ed is a sum of blocks of mod Gr T , the\nZbr (\u03bb) \u2208 mod Gr T ed onto that of Z\nbr (\u03bb)] coincides with \u0398\nb r (\u03bb). Consequently, \u03a6(\u0398\nb r (\u03bb)) =\ncomponent of \u0393s (mod Gr T ed ) containing [Z\nb r\u2212d (\u03bc), so that (b) and (d) hold for G\u0303 := G.\n\u0398\nAnother application of [35, (II.10.4/5)] shows that the restriction of\n\u03a5 : mod Gr \u2212\u2192 mod Gr\u2212d ; M 7\u2192 HomGd (Std , M )[\u2212d] ,\n\nto mod Dist(Gr )ed is an equivalence of categories.

By Lemma 3.5,\nthe corresponding pull-back functor \u03c0 \u2217 : mod Gr T \u2212\u2192 mod G\u0303r T\u0303 allows us to view mod Gr T as the\nsum of those blocks of mod G\u0303r T\u0303 , whose modules have weights belonging to X(T ) \u2286 X(T\u0303 ).\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n27\n\nb\u0303 (\u03bb) of\nWe first show that the pull-back \u03c0 \u2217 (Zbr (\u03bb)) coincides with the baby Verma module Z\nr\nmod G\u0303r T\u0303 . Since G\u0303 is a covering, the map \u03c9 induces an isomorphism \u0168 \u2212 \u2212\u2192 U \u2212 , cf.

Thus, [35, (II.11.2)] provides a filtration of \u03c0 \u2217 (Zbr (\u03bb)) by baby\nb\u0303 (\u03bc). Since all weights of\nVerma modules, which, for dimension reasons, only has one constituent Z\nr\n\nb\u0303 (\u03bc) are \u2264 \u03bc, we obtain \u03bb = \u03bc.\nbr (\u03bb)) are \u2264 \u03bb, while all weights of Z\n\u03c0 \u2217 (Z\nr\nThe depth of \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) coincides with the depth of \u03bb, viewed as an element of X(T\u0303 ) (see [35,\n(II.1.17)]).

Then there exists a\ncovering group G\u0303 and a weight \u03bc \u2208 X(T\u0303 ) with the following properties.\n(a) There exists a surjective morphism \u03a5 : \u0398r (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 \u0398r\u2212d (\u03bc) of stable translation quivers such\nthat \u03a5(x+ ) = \u03a5(x)+ for all x \u2208 \u0398r (\u03bb).\n(b) If G is semi-simple and simply connected, then \u03a5 is an isomorphism.\nProof. According to Theorem 6.6, there exists a covering group G\u0303 and functors\n\u03a6 : mod Gr T \u2212\u2192 mod G\u0303r\u2212d T\u0303 and \u03a5 : mod Gr \u2212\u2192 mod G\u0303r\u2212d\ngiving rise to a commutative diagram\n\u03a6\n\nmod Gr T \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 mod G\u0303r\u2212d T\u0303\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nFy\nF\u0303y\n\u03a5\n\nmod G\u0303r\u2212d .\nmod Gr \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nIn addition, the functor \u03a6 induces an isomorphism\nb r (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 \u0398\nb r\u2212d (\u03bc) ; [M ] 7\u2192 [\u03a6(M )]\n\u0398\n\nfor a suitable weight \u03bc \u2208 X(T\u0303 ) of depth 1. In view of Lemma 3.3 and the above diagram, the map\n\u03a5 : \u0398r (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 \u0398r\u2212d (\u03bc) ; [M ] 7\u2192 [\u03a5(M )]\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n29\n\nis well-defined.\nb r (\u03bb) such that\nIf \u03b1 : x \u2192 y is an arrow in \u0398r (\u03bb), then there exists an arrow \u03b1\u0302 : x\u0302 \u2192 \u0177 in \u0398\nF(x\u0302) = x and F(\u0177) = y. Consequently, \u03a5(\u03b1) := F\u0303(\u0398(\u03b1\u0302)) is an arrow in \u0398r\u2212d (\u03bc) with starting\npoint F\u0303(\u03a6(x\u0302)) = \u03a5(F(x\u0302)) = \u03a5(x) and endpoint F\u0303(\u03a6(\u0177)) = \u03a5(y). With this definition, \u03a5 becomes\na morphism of quivers. Since F, \u03a6, and F\u0303 commute with translations, so does \u03a5. Finally, given\nx = F(x\u0302) \u2208 \u0398r (\u03bb), we obtain, observing Lemma 3.3,\n\u03a5(x+ ) = \u03a5(F(x\u0302+ )) = F\u0303(\u03a6(x\u0302+ )) = F\u0303(\u03a6(x\u0302)+ ) = (F\u0303 \u25e6 \u03a6)(x\u0302)+ = \u03a5(x)+ ,\nas desired.\nProperty (b) follows directly from step (i) of the proof of Theorem 6.6.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample. Let G = SL(2) and \u03bb = pr\u22121 a \u2212 1, a 6\u2208 pZ be a weight of depth r. If r \u2265 2, then Corollary\n6.7 implies \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= \u03981 (a \u2212 1). Since \u03981 (a \u2212 1) has a one-dimensional support variety, it is of the\nform Z[A\u221e ]/(\u03c4 ), with Z1 (a \u2212 1) having exactly one predecessor. Consequently, \u0398r (\u03bb) and Zr (\u03bb)\nhave the same properties.\n\n7. Verma Modules of Complexity at most 2\nThe purpose of this final section is to indicate the utility of the results and methods established\nso far. In particular, we show that questions concerning Verma modules of complexity at most 2\ncan be reduced to the case where the underlying groups are the first and second Frobenius kernels\nof SL(2). Throughout, G is assumed to be defined over Fp .\nWe begin with the following refinement of Lemma 4.1.\nLemma 7.1. Suppose that G is semi-simple, simply connected and that p is good for G. Let Zr (\u03bb)\nbe a Verma module of complexity 1. Then \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= Z[A\u221e ]/(\u03c4 ) is a homogeneous tube.\nProof. Writing d + 1 = dp(\u03bb), we obtain from Theorem 6.6 the identity r \u2212 d = 1. Thus, Corollary\n6.7 provides an isomorphism\n\u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= \u03981 (\u03bc)\nfor some weight \u03bc. In particular, the component \u03981 (\u03bc) consists of \u03c4 -periodic vertices, and [15,\n(2.5)] yields the result.\n\u0003\nAs a first Corollary, we show that Verma modules of complexity 2 possess equidimenisonal support\nvarieties:\nCorollary 7.2. Let G be semi-simple and simply connected. Suppose that p \u2265 7, and let \u03bb \u2208 X(T )\nbe a weight such that cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = 2. Then VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) is equidimensional.\nProof. In view of Theorem 6.2, we may assume that dp(\u03bb) = 1. Thanks to Corollary 5.2, we thus\nhave\n2 = cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u2265 r,\nand Corollary 6.5 yields the irreducibility of VGr (Zr (\u03bb)) in case r = 2. Alternatively, [22, (3.3)]\nimplies that the rank variety V1 (G)Z1 (\u03bb) is equidimenional. Owing to [24, (1.4)], the support variety\n\u0003\nVG1 (Z1 (\u03bb)) enjoys the same property.\n\n\f30\n\nR. FARNSTEINER and G. R\u00d6HRLE\n\nBy showing that Verma modules of complexity 2 over higher Frobenius kernels essentially only occur\nfor SL(2)2 , our next result extends [22, (3.5)]. We leave the modifications concerning modules of\ncomplexity 1 to the interested reader.\nProposition 7.3. Suppose r \u2265 2, p \u2265 7, and let \u03bb \u2208 X(T ) be a weight such that dp(\u03bb) = 1 and\ncxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u2264 2. Then the following statements hold:\n(1) r = 2 and Gr \u223c\n= Sr \u00d7 Hr , where S \u223c\n= SL(2) and H is reductive.\n(2) There is an isomorphism Zr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= ZrS (\u03bb)\u2297k ZrH (\u03bb), with cxSr (ZrS (\u03bb)) = cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)), and\nthe second factor being a simple projective Hr -module.\nProof. Since \u03a8\u03bb 6= \u03a8 and p is good, there exists a simple root \u03b1 in \u03a8 \\ \u03a8\u03bb . According to Corollary\n5.2, we have r = 2 as well as V(U\u03b1 )r (k) \u2286 VGr (Zr (\u03bb)). In view of [50, (1.14)] and [51, (5.2),(6.8)],\nwe obtain the same inclusion for the corresponding rank varieties:\nVr (U\u03b1 ) \u2286 Vr (G)Zr (\u03bb) .\n\u223c Vr (Ga ) \u223c\nThus, Vr (U\u03b1 ) =\n(cf. [50, (1.10)]) is an irreducible component of the B-invariant\n=\nvariety Vr (G)Zr (\u03bb) . Hence Vr (U\u03b1 ) is B-invariant, and the orbit B.\u03c6 of the canonical isomorphism\nkr\n\n\u03c6\n\nGa(r) \u2212\u2192 (U\u03b1 )r belongs to Vr (U\u03b1 ). This implies that (U\u03b1 )r is B-invariant, so that its Lie algebra\nLie((U\u03b1 )r ) = Lie(U\u03b1 ) = g\u03b1 enjoys the same property. An application of [22, (3.3)] (and its proof)\nnow implies that G = SH is an almost direct product with\n(a) e\u03b1 \u2208 Lie(S), and\n(b) S is almost simple of type A1 , and\n(c) Lie(G) = Lie(S) \u2295 Lie(H).\nOur assumption on p implies (S \u2229 H)1 \u2286 Cent(S)1 = ek , so that (S \u2229 H)r = ek . Thus, the canonical\nmap S \u00d7 H \u2212\u2192 G induces a closed embedding Sr \u00d7 Hr \u0592\u2192 Gr . Applying [35, (I.9.6)] several times\nwe obtain\ndimk k[Gr ] = pr dim G = pr(dim S+dim H) = dimk k[Sr ] dimk k[Hr ] = dimk k[Sr \u00d7 Hr ],\nso that the above map is in fact an isomorphism.\nIn view of [35, (I.7.9(3))], the arguments of [22, (1.1)] show that the decomposition Gr = Sr \u00d7 Hr\ninduces an isomorphism\nZr (\u03bb) \u223c\n= ZrS (\u03bb)\u2297k ZrH (\u03bb)\nbetween Zr (\u03bb) and the outer tensor product of the corresponding Verma modules of the factors.\nThus, [51, (7.2)] implies\nVGr (Zr (\u03bb)) \u223c\n= VSr (ZrS (\u03bb))\u00d7VHr (ZrH (\u03bb)).\nSince e\u03b1 \u2208 Lie(S), we see that \u03b1 is a root of S. Consequently, U\u03b1 \u2286 S, and another application\nof Corollary 5.2 implies that V(U\u03b1 )r (k) \u2286 VSr (ZrS (\u03bb)). In particular, 2 \u2264 dim VSr (ZrS (\u03bb)), so that\nZrH (\u03bb) is projective. It thus follows from a consecutive application of [35, (II.11.8)] and [35, (II.9.6e)]\nthat ZrH (\u03bb) is a simple projective Hr -module.\nIn view of [49, (7.2.4)], the group S is isomorphic to SL(2) or PSL(2). Since p 6= 2, the center\nof SL(2) is reduced, so that the canonical map SL(2) \u2212\u2192 PSL(2) induces an isomorphism of the\nFrobenius kernels of these groups.\n\u0003\nLet L \u2286 G be a Levi subgroup of G and S \u2286 L be its semi-simple part. Given \u03bb \u2208 X(T ), we denote\nby \u0398Sr (\u03bb) the connected component of \u0393s (Sr ) containing the Verma module ZrS (\u03bb|T \u2229S ).\nAccording to [35, (II.9.1(3), II.9.4, II.11.8)] a non-projective Verma module Zr (\u03bb) is defined by\na highest weight \u03bb of depth dp(\u03bb) \u2264 r. The following theorem reduces us to the case r \u2264 2.\n\n\fVARIETIES AND GOOD FILTRATIONS\n\n31\n\nTheorem 7.4. Let G be semi-simple and simply connected. Suppose that p \u2265 7, and let Zr (\u03bb) be\na Verma module of complexity cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = 2. Then we have r \u2032 := r \u2212 dp(\u03bb) + 1 \u2264 2, and there\nexist a group S \u223c\n= SL(2), SL(2) \u00d7 SL(2), SL(3), a weight \u03b3 of S of depth 1, and an isomorphism\n\u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= SL(2) for r \u2032 = 2.\n= \u0398r\u2032 (\u03b3) sending [Zr (\u03bb)] onto [Zr\u2032 (\u03b3)]. Moreover, we have S \u223c\nProof. We put dp(\u03bb) = d + 1, with d \u2265 0. Thanks to Theorem 6.6 and Corollary 6.7, there exists\na weight \u03bc of depth 1 and a quiver isomorphism \u0398r (\u03bb) \u223c\n= \u0398r\u2212d (\u03bc), sending [Zr (\u03bb)] onto [Zr\u2212d (\u03bc)].\nBy Theorem 6.6, we have\nr \u2032 := r \u2212 d \u2264 cxGr\u2212d (Zr\u2212d (\u03bc)) = cxGr (Zr (\u03bb)) = 2.\nIf r \u2032 = 1, then our result follows from [22, (3.5)]. Alternatively, Proposition 7.3 implies the existence\nof a decomposition Gr\u2032 = Sr\u2032 \u00d7Hr\u2032 with S \u223c\n= SL(2). By the same token, there is an isomorphism\nZr\u2032 (\u03bc) \u223c\n= Z S\u2032 (\u03bc)\u2297k Z H\u2032 (\u03bc),\nr\n\nwith\n\nZrH\u2032 (\u03bc)\n\nr\n\nbeing a simple projective H -module. By the arguments of [22, (3.5)], the functor\nr\u2032\n\nSr\u2032 -mod \u2212\u2192 Gr\u2032 -mod ; M 7\u2192 M \u2297k ZrH\u2032 (\u03bc)\ninduces a Morita equivalence between the blocks Br\u2032 (\u03bc|T \u2229S ) and Br\u2032 (\u03bc) sending ZrS\u2032 (\u03bc) onto Zr\u2032 (\u03bc).\nAs a result, we obtain a quiver isomorphism \u0398Sr\u2032 (\u03bc) \u223c\n= \u0398r\u2032 (\u03bc), which maps [ZrS\u2032 (\u03bc)] onto [Zr\u2032 (\u03bc)].\nOur assertion thus follows by composing the above isomorphisms of stable translation quivers. \u0003\nRemark. By the same line of arguments, a semi-simple, simply connected group G affords Verma\nmodules of complexity 2 only if it possesses almost simple factors of types A1 or A2 .\nAcknowledgements: This research was funded in part by EPSRC grant GR/R86546/01.
