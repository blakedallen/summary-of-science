Much of\nthis focuses on the behaviour of fermions and bosons at low temperatures, where the deviations in their behaviour arising from the distributions are significant and quantum effects\ndominate. The advent of comprehensive experimental techniques for lowering the temperature of systems to previously theoretical values over the last few decades has contributed\nsignificantly to this and revealed a wealth of unusual behaviour at extremely low temperatures, in particular the unusual phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation - a macroscopic\noccupation of the ground state of a gas of bosons at finite temperature.\nFor most of this time, however, there has been only a cursory and passing interest in lowdimensional Fermi and Bose systems. This has been mainly because they have been viewed\nas little more than abstract theoretical and mathematical constructs. Moreover, it was felt\nthat there was little behaviour of interest to be found in these lower dimensions. It is only\nover the last couple of decades that there has been a growing interest in the properties of\ngases obeying the Fermi and Bose distributions in lower dimensions. This has been driven\nby firstly, the growing practical importance of low-dimensional systems, such as for example\nin computers, as well as new experimental techniques (such as, for example, 2D adsorbed\nsystems, in particular, 2D adsorbed helium films3,4,5,6 ) that raise the possibility of being able\nto trap and study low-dimensional quantum systems. Typical systems being studied include\nsuperfluid and superconducting films, quantum Hall and related two-dimensional electron\ngases and low-dimensional trapped Bose gases. Further, the renewed theoretical interest in\nlow-dimensional physics over the last couple of decades has led to a growing realisation that\nthese systems possess equally fascinating and unique quantum behaviour of their own (see,\nfor example, Ref. 7). In particular, recent observations of exotic quantum behavior, such\nas Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)8,9,10 and Fermi degeneracy11 , in three-dimensional\nsystems have led to a growing interest in lower-dimensional systems.\nOne special theoretical interest in the 2D ideal gas is due to the fact that we can obtain\ncompletely analytic expressions for the chemical potential \u03bc and other thermodynamic properties. This arises, in part, from the energy-independence of the 2D density of states within\nthe semi-classical approximation. Furthermore, in two dimensions, there is an unusual cor2\n\n\frespondence between the Bose and Fermi cases, first noted by May12 and subsequently,\nexplored further in later papers13,14,15,16,17 .\nIn his seminal paper12 , May noted the unexpected result that the thermal capacities\nof the ideal 2D Bose and Fermi gases are identical in the thermodynamic limit, i.e. their\ninternal energies differ only by a constant temperature-independent amount. This only\nholds in the thermodynamic limit, or equivalently, the semi-classical approximation that\nthe energy level spacing is negligible compared with the temperature T, allowing us to\nreplace the discrete (quantum) structure by a continuum. Real-world systems, however, are\nalways finite, typically of the order of 103 \u2212 106 particles for trapped gases, and more for\nadsorbed systems. Moreover, as we shall see later, the chemical potential \u03bc has a logarithmic\ndependence on the total number of particles N in the system. Thus, the thermodynamic limit\nis never truly reached in two dimensions and is an abstract theoretical construct, making it\nessential to consider finite-size effects. These may be experimentally significant, and lead to\ndeviations from May's Theorem.\nIn the following sections, we shall consider the behaviour of the uniform 2D ideal Bose and\nFermi gases. In the next section, we shall briefly outline the gases in the thermodynamic\nlimit and derive May's Theorem before examining the Bose and Fermi gases for a finite\nnumber of particles in Section III. Though there is no BEC in the thermodynamic limit,\nwe will demonstrate that there is a pseudo-condensation at very low temperatures for the\nfinite 2D Bose gas. This is then used to show in Section IV that the finite-size effects lead to\ndiffering heat capacities for the Bose and Fermi gases, and a breakdown in May's Theorem\nfor gases with a finite number of particles. Further, the inadequacy of heat capacities as a\nmeans of determining phase transitions is discussed.\n\nII.\n\nTHE THERMODYNAMIC LIMIT\n\nAs the 2D ideal gas and May's Theorem have already been examined at length before in\nthe thermodynamic limit12,13,14,15,16,17 , we shall simply draw on earlier approaches to provide\na brief overview. Consider N free and identical particles of mass m in a 2D box of 'volume'A,\nwith rigid-box boundary conditions. The energy values for an arbitrary particle then are\n\u03b5i =\n\n~2 k 2\n,\n2m\n\nk2 =\n\n3\n\n\u0001\n\u03c02 2\nnx + n2y ,\nA\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere k is the momentum characterising the energy states \u03b5i , i, nx , ny = 1, 2, 3 . . . and\n(nx , ny ) are points in the positive quadrant of a unit square lattice. In the thermodynamic\nlimit, the ground state energy tends to 0. For a finite system, however, due to the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, this is always greater than 0, as (nx , ny ) = (1, 1). So, for simplicity,\nwe shift the energy scale, taking the ground state energy as 0,\n\u03b5i =\n\n\u0001\n\u03c0 2 ~2 2\n~2 k 2\nnx + n2y \u2212 2 .\n\u2212 \u03b50 =\n2m\n2mA\n\n(2)\n\nAssuming that the system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T and chemical potential\n\u03bc, then the mean number of particles n (\u03b5i ) at a given energy \u03b5i is given by\nn (\u03b5i ) =\n\n1\ne(\u03b5i\u2212\u03bc)/kB T\n\n\u00b11\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nHere and later, the upper (lower) signs are for fermions (bosons). The total number of\nparticles N and the internal energy E of the system are now given by\nN=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn (\u03b5i ) ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b5i n (\u03b5i ) .\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nE=\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=1\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the single particle energy states. In the semiclassical approximation, we assume that the spacing between the energy levels of the particle states is negligible.\nThis allows us to replace the sum with an integral over energy states using the density of\nstates g(\u03b5) and the spin degeneracy \u03b1,\nZ \u221e\nf =\u03b1\nf (\u03b5) g (\u03b5) n (\u03b5) d\u03b5,\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhere f (\u03b5) is a general single-particle function of energy. However, this approximation is\nonly exact in the thermodynamic limit when the system size is infinite, and at very high\ntemperatures T . As we shall see in Section III, for finite systems at low T, these assumptions\nare invalid and the discreteness of the energy levels cannot be ignored. In other words, we\nwill be at a temperature T below which the semiclassical approximation breaks down and\nmodifications need to be made. However, it may be possible to compensate by modifying\nthe semi-classical approximation to allow for finite-size effects.\nWe now evaluate the various thermodynamic quantities for arbitrary spin, i.e. arbitrary\n\u03b1, for both the 2D Fermi and Bose gases in the thermodynamic limit. In 2D, g(\u03b5) and\n4\n\n\fthereby, the Fermi energy \u03b5F are given by,\ng(\u03b5) =\n\nmA\n,\n2\u03c0~2\n\n\u03b5F =\n\n2\u03c0~2 N\n.\n\u03b1mA\n\n(7)\n\nFor comparison, we adopt \u03b5F as a characteristic energy \u03b5C for the Bose gas also, allowing\nus to express later results in a unified form. In 2D, as g(\u03b5) is a constant, we have a simple\nintegral for N,\n\u03b1mA\nN=\n2\u03c0~2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b5\ne(\u03b5\u2212\u03bc)/kB T\n\n0\n\n\u00b11\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThis may be expressed using the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein functions1,2 , f\u03bd (z) and g\u03bd (z)\nrespectively,\nZ \u221e \u03bd\u22121\nx dx\n1\nf\u03bd (z) =\n\u0393 (\u03bd) 0 z \u22121 ex + 1\nZ \u221e \u03bd\u22121\n1\nx dx\ng\u03bd (z) =\n,\n\u22121\n\u0393 (\u03bd) 0 z ex \u2212 1\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere \u0393 (\u03bd) is the Euler gamma function. These can also be expressed using the polylogarithmic functions Li\u03bd (z)18,19 ,\nf\u03bd (z) = \u2212Li\u03bd (\u2212z) ,\n\n(11)\n\ng\u03bd (z) = Li\u03bd (z) .\n\n(12)\n\nFor N above, \u03bd = 1 and z is the fugacity (z = e\u03bc/kB T ). Solving (8) in terms of \u03b5C and\nrearranging, we can now express the fugacity z and thereby, the chemical potential \u03bc as a\ncompletely analytic expression\n\u0001\nzF,B = e\u03bc/kB T = \u2213 1 \u2212 e\u00b1\u03b5C /kB T ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere zF (zB ) is the fugacity for the ideal Fermi (Bose) gas. As T \u2192 0, zB smoothly\napproaches 1. Denoting the fugacity zB by zB = e\u2212\u03b1 , as zB \u2192 1,\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng1 e\u2212\u03b1 = \u2212 ln 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u2212 ln \u03b1.\n\u03b1\u21920\n\n(14)\n\nN diverges logarithmically as \u03b1 \u2192 0. Thus, it has no upper bound, and there is no temperature below which the ground state can be said to be macroscopically occupied in comparison\nto the excited states. Thus, there is no BEC in the thermodynamic limit. This is a qualification of the oft-paraded statement that there is no BEC for D \u2264 2, where D is the number of\n5\n\n\fdimensions. However, as we shall see in Section III, the logarithmic divergence implies that\nat sufficiently low T, bosons still crowd into low-lying states to give a pseudo-condensate.\nThe internal energy may be similarly solved,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\nkB T\nf2 e\u03b5C /kB T \u2212 1 ,\nEF = NkB T\n\u03b5\n\u0012 C\u0013\n\u0001\nkB T\nEB = NkB T\ng2 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b5C /kB T .\n\u03b5C\n\nNow, using the following property of the dilogarithmic function12,19 Li2 (x),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2212 1 = g2 (1 \u2212 x) + (ln x)2 ,\nf2\nx\n2\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nwe can easily show\n1\nEF = EB + N\u03b5C .\n2\n\n(18)\n\ni.e. for all T , EB differs from EF by a constant temperature independent energy, which does\nnot contribute to the heat capacity. This gives May's Theorem12 , which states that the heat\ncapacities of the ideal 2D Fermi and Bose gases are identical at all T and N,\nCV,Bose =\n\n\u2202EF\n\u2202EB\n|V =\n| = CV,F ermi .\n\u2202T\n\u2202T V\n\n(19)\n\nThe above result indicates that the 2D ideal Bose gas does not undergo a phase transition,\nas any experimental measurement of the heat capacity would be the same as for a 2D Fermi\ngas, and would lack the characteristic bump that indicates the presence of BEC in the 3D\nBose gas. However, as we shall see, this is because we have failed to consider the finite\nnature of any real systems.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE FINITE GAS\n\nThe case of the finite ideal Bose gas in two dimensions has already been considered to\nvarying degrees in earlier papers20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28 , and more recently, by Pathria29 . Most\nhave commented that it may be possible to have a pseudo-condensation in the Bose gas\nin two dimensions, with the transition temperature typically going as TC \u223c 1/ ln N. Here,\nwe present a simpler and more comprehensive analysis of the problem that not only offers\nfar more insight into how the finite size of the system leads to the breakdown of May's\n6\n\n\fTheorem and a pseudo-condensation in the Bose gas, but further, in Section IV, discusses\nhow the heat capacities for the Fermi and Bose gases differ for finite systems, and how such\na pseudo-condensation may be experimentally measured.\nAt T = 0, the 2D Bose gas is in its ground state, and we have the trivial case of ground\nstate macroscopic occupation. Extrapolating, however, a range of finite temperatures must\nexist near T = 0, which may depend on N, where the number of particles in the ground\nstate is also of O (N) - a macroscopic occupation. At very low T , this can be a significant\nfraction of N, and the semi-classical approach is now flawed as N is no longer continuous.\nTaking macroscopic occupation of the ground state as the defining characteristic of BEC,\nwe consider the ground state separately analogous to standard treatments of the 3D Bose\ngas1,2 . For finite systems, the discrete level structure requires us to introduce a cutoff energy\nat the first excited level \u03b51 . The integral is now bounded and we can remove the logarithmic\ndivergence. Thus, we can have a pseudo-BEC in a finite two-dimensional system. This must\nbe associated with a breakdown of May's theorem at sufficiently low T for finite systems.\nWe thus write (8) for the Bose gas as\n\u03b1mA\nN = N0 +\n2\u03c0~2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03b51\n\nd\u03b5\ne(\u03b5\u2212\u03bc)/kB T\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\nIt should be noted that the above approximation is quite a simple and crude one, as it\nis only the leading term of the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it suits the\npurposes of our paper as our intention here is merely to highlight how even the simplest\napproximations show that there is a pseudo-condensation in the finite Bose gas. A more\ndetailed approximation will only lead to minor modifications to the core results presented\nin the rest of this paper. Further, the leading correction term to the integral above in the\n\u0001\u22121\nEuler-Maclaurin expansion is of the order of N1 = n (\u03b51 ) = e(\u03b51 \u2212\u03bc)/kB T\n. Taking the ratio\n\nN0 /N1 of the number of particles in the ground state to that in the first excited state, we\ncan see\n\u03b51 \u2212 \u03bc\nN0\n\u2248\nN1\n\u2212\u03bc\n\n(21)\n\nAs the chemical potential \u03bc for the 2D Bose gas is always negative and less than 0, the\nabove ration is always greater than 1. Further, as T \u2192 0, \u03bc \u2192 0 and the above expression\nclearly goes to \u221e. Further, a more detailed evaluation of (21) gives us\n2\u03c0~ 2 N\nN0\n3\u03c0 2 ~2 \u03b1mAk\nBT\n\u2248\ne\nN1\n2mAkB T\n\n7\n\n(22)\n\n\fThis clearly rapidly goes to infinity as both the temperature T as well as the number of\nparticles N increase. Moreover, for the regime in question, we are interested in very low\ntemperatures where from the above equation (22), the ratio N0 /N1 is clearly significantly\nlarge.\nThus, we are justified in making our crude approximation and denoting the number of\nparticles N by (20) above. Solving as before, we now have\n\u0011\n\u03b1mAkB T \u0010\n\u22123\u03c0 2 ~2 /2mAkB T\nN \u2212 N0 = \u2212\nln\n1\n\u2212\nz\ne\nB\n2\u03c0~2\n\n(23)\n\nand \u03b51 prevents the logarithmic divergence. This is because the excited states cannot accommodate all the particles at low T , and the excess are forced into the ground state, leading to\na pseudo-BEC. Equivalently, changing variables \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5 + \u03b51 and resetting the integral from\nzero, we may also express (20) in terms of the Bose-Einstein functions g\u03bd (z) as\n\u0011\n\u03b1mAkB T \u0010\n\u22123\u03c0 2 ~2 /2mAkB T\nN \u2212 N0 =\ng1 zB e\n.\n2\u03c0~2\n\n(24)\n\nThus, we now have an effective fugacity\n\nzB \u2212\u2192 zB\u2032 = zB e\u22123\u03c0\n\n2 ~2 /2mAk\n\nBT\n\n\u0001\n= e\u22123\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5C /4N kB T 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b5C /kB T .\n\n(25)\n\nwhere zB is as before. This summarizes the finite-size effects on the Bose gas. The extra\nterm is dependent on the system size and tends to 1 as N \u2192 \u221e. For finite N and low T , it\nis less than 1, and so, the fugacity is modified. Thus, there is a pseudo-BEC here but none\nin the thermodynamic limit. This macroscopic occupation is a purely boson phenomenon,\nand so, the behaviour will be markedly different from that of the two-dimensional Fermi\ngas.\nFor the Fermi gas, Pauli's principle forbids macroscopic occupation of any state. Thus,\nthe first term is not divergent. zF (Eq. (13)) still holds, and finite-size effects only appear for\nthe Bose gas, where the excited states take as many particles as possible at low T , with the\nexcess forced into the ground state. This occurs at the maximal value of the fugacity zB = 1.\nThus, we can define a characteristic temperature TC that marks the onset of condensation\nwhere N0 \u2248 0 and z \u2248 1,\n\u0011\n\u03b1mAkB TC \u0010\n\u22123\u03c0 2 ~2 /2mAkB TC\nln\n1\n\u2212\ne\nN\u223c\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0~2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nNkB TC\n4NkB TC\n\u2243\nln\n\u03b5C\n3\u03c0\u03b1\u03b5C\n8\n\n(26)\n\n\ffor very low T . We may solve (26) to give\nTC =\n\n\u03b5C\n1\n,\nkB W (4N /3\u03c0\u03b1)\n\n(27)\n\nwhere, W (x) is the Lambert function30 and is the principal solution for w in the equation x =\nwew . This is plotted in Fig. 1. It may be viewed as a generalisation to a logarithm. Thus, our\nresult (27) is a refinement of the earlier noted result that the transition temperature behaves\nlike TC \u223c 1/ ln N. As N \u2192 \u221e, the reduced characteristic temperature kB TC /\u03b5C \u2192 0. Thus,\nin the thermodynamic limit, we recover the conventional result that there is no BEC in two\ndimensions. The condensate fraction is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4NkB T\nN0 \u223c\nkB T\nln\n=1\u2212\nN\n\u03b5C\n3\u03c0\u03b1\u03b5C\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\nT\nk\nT\nT\nB\nC\n\u223c\n1+\nln\n.\n=1\u2212\nTC\n\u03b5C\nTC\n\n(28)\n\nThis only holds for very low temperatures T < TC . As can be seen in Fig. 2, the condensate\noccurs at lower and lower T as the system size N increases. In the thermodynamic limit,\nthere is no BEC at all.\nHaving shown the pseudo-condensation, we now move on to consider how the Fermi-Bose\ncorrespondence predicted by May is affected when the gases are assumed finite.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE FINITE GAS: INTERNAL ENERGY AND HEAT CAPACITY\n\nThe internal energies may be similarly found. The first term in (5) for the Bose gas is\ndivergent as it is the internal energy Egs associated with the anomalously large ground state.\nSeparating this out,\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nEB = Egs +\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b5i\n(\u03b5\n\u2212\u03bc)/k\nBT\ne i\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nAs we have set Egs as the zero-point energy, the first term is 0. Changing variables \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5+\u03b51 ,\nand converting to an integral,\nN\nEB =\n\u03b5C\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u03b5 + \u03b51\n(\u03b5+\u03b5\n\u2212\u03bc)/kB T\n1\ne\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03b5\n\n\u03b51\nN\n(kB T )2 g2 (zB\u2032 ) + NkB T g1 (zB\u2032 ) .\n\u03b5C\n\u03b5C\n\n(30)\n\nwhere zB\u2032 is defined by (25). We again have an effective fugacity zB\u2032 and additional terms,\nwhich are negligible in the thermodynamic limit. By contrast, for the finite Fermi gas, there\n9\n\n\fis no divergence in the ground state term, and we have the same expression for the fugacity\n(13) as before. The internal energies of the finite two-dimensional Fermi and Bose gases are\nthen given by\nEF\nEB\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0001\nkB T\n= NkB T\nf2 e\u03b5C /kB T \u2212 1\n\u03b5C\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 2\n3\u03c0\u03b1\nNkB T\ng2 (zB\u2032 ) \u2212\nkB T ln (1 \u2212 zB\u2032 )\n=\n\u03b5C\n4\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nEq. (18) is no longer true, as we cannot simply express EF in terms of EB as before. EB\nnow has additional T -dependent terms that lead to a differing heat capacity.\nMay's Theorem is thus a special limiting case for the 2D Bose and Fermi internal energies\nin the thermodynamic limit. Here, the additional factor e\u22123\u03c0\u03b1\u03b5C /4N kB T tends to unity in the\nthermodynamic limit, recovering May's Theorem. The same occurs in the high T limit for a\nfinite gas as above TC , there is no macroscopic ground state occupation. Thus, above TC , we\nmay approximate the internal energies by (15) and (16) with differences becoming marked\nonly at very low T and/or very small system size N.\nWe now calculate the Bose and Fermi heat capacities by using the following polylogarithmic identity2,18 ,\n1\nd\nLin+1 (z) = Lin (z)\ndz\nz\nThe heat capacity for the finite gas is then given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u0001\n\u03b52C\n1\nNkB\n\u2212\u03b5C /kB T\n2T g2 1 \u2212 e\n\u2212 2\nCV,F ermi =\n\u03b5C\nkB T e\u03b5C /kB T \u2212 1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\nNkB\n\u03b5C ln (1 \u2212 zB\u2032 )\n\u2032\nCV,Bose =\n2T g2 (zB ) +\n\u03b5C\nkB e\u03b5C /kB T \u2212 1\n\"\n#\n\u0001\n3\u03c0\u03b1kB \u03b5C 3\u03c0\u03b1zB\u2032 \u2212 4Ne\u2212\u03b5C /kB T \u22123\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5C /4N kB T\n+\n\u2212 8N ln (1 \u2212 zB\u2032 )\n16N\nkB T (1 \u2212 zB\u2032 )\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nThe Bose heat capacity CV,Bose now contains several terms dependent on both N and T . It\nshould also be noted that the last two terms in the heat capacity are very much smaller than\nthe first two terms and become increasingly negligible as the system size increases. At high\nT and/or very large N, the additional terms tend to zero, i.e. as N \u2192 \u221e and/or T \u2192 \u221e,\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03b5C /NkB T \u2192 0, and (35) reduces to the standard expression in the thermodynamic limit,\n\nCV,Bose \u2192\n\n2\n\u0001 N\u03b5C\n1\n2NkB\nT\ng2 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b5C /kB T \u2212\n= CV,F ermi .\n\u03b5\n/k\nT \u22121\nC\nB\n\u03b5C\nT e\n\n10\n\n(36)\n\n\fThis is one of the most important results of our paper, and shows clearly that May's theorem\narises as the thermodynamic limit of (34) and (35), when the heat capacities of the Bose\nand Fermi gases become equal. Nevertheless, for most real-world 2D systems, above the\ncharacteristic temperature TC , which marks the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in the\ntwo-dimensional ideal Bose gas, \u03c0\u03b1\u03b5C /NkB T is very small and so, even for finite gases,\nthe thermal capacities of the Bose and Fermi systems are approximately equal above the\ncondensation temperature.\nIn Fig. 3, we plot the reduced heat capacities (CV /NkB T \u2217 ) for the Fermi and Bose gases\nagainst the reduced temperature T \u2217 (where T \u2217 = kB T /\u03b5C ) for varying system size N, using\nthe full expression for both CV,Bose and CV,F ermi . As the heat capacity is approximately\nlinear close to T = 0 in the thermodynamic limit, we would expect the plots for the 2D\nFermi gas to tend to a horizontal line as T \u2192 0. This limiting value will be at the critical\nvalue when T \u2217 = 0, i.e.\nCV,F ermi\n\u03c02\n=\n2g\n(1)\n=\n2\u03b6\n(2)\n=\n.\n2\nNkB T \u2217\n3\n\n(37)\n\nIn contrast, for the finite 2D Bose gas, we expect to see a deviation from the above mentioned low-temperature behaviour. In particular, we expect that the reduced heat capacity\n(CV /NkB T \u2217 ) will fall to 0 following the formation of the condensate. Our plots indicate\ndistinct differences between the reduced heat capacities for the Bose and Fermi gases, particularly at very low T in the vicinity of and below the condensation temperature TC . Then,\nCV,Bose is less than CV,F ermi and starts to deviate significantly around TC , before rapidly\ngoing to zero as we approach T = 0. This is in marked contrast to the 3D Bose gas, where\nthe conventional heat capacity CV /NkB peaks at some finite T . In the two-dimensional\ncase, however, the heat capacity CV /NkB is a smooth function of T , in keeping with the\nsize-dependent nature of the condensation. Here, instead, we see a \"bump\"in the plot for\nthe reduced heat capacity CV /NkB T \u2217 of the 2D Bose gas, indicating the presence of a condensation. Further, as N increases, the behaviour tends to that of the 2D Fermi gas as the\ncondensation forms at lower temperatures, and consequently, the fall-off of the reduced heat\ncapacity occurs at lower temperatures. Indeed, with N = 500000, the two plots of the Fermi\nand Bose gases are virtually indistinguishable. This is significant as conventionally, the\nheat capacity CV /NkB is used experimentally to determine if a Bose-Einstein condensation\nhas occurred. However, as can be seen from above, the heat capacity does not necessarily\n11\n\n\fpeak for a weak transition which is dependent on the system size, and we have to examine\nalternate expressions to determine the presence of a condensation.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we set out to discuss the two-dimensional ideal Bose and Fermi gases in the\nabsence of any trapping potentials, and both in the thermodynamic limit and the finite case.\nIn particular, we were interested in May's Theorem, and its breakdown for finite systems.\nAs can be seen above in Sections III and IV, the 2D finite Fermi system displays the same\nbehaviour as in the thermodynamic limit but the Bose gas deviates significantly for a finite\nsystem and undergoes a pseudo-Bose-Einstein condensation. It is not a \"true\"condensation\nas for the 3D Bose gas, where there is a distinct phase transition in the thermodynamic limit\nand a peak in the heat capacity. Rather, here we have a characteristic condensation temperature TC that is dependent on the system size and tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit.\nMoreover, though these is no heat capacity peak here, it still deviates significantly from the\nFermi heat capacity below TC with the deviations tending to zero as the system size and/or\nthe temperature increase. In other words, we have a peak in the reduced heat capacity, as\nshown in Fig. 3. This raises the question of what exactly is defined as a phase transition.\nThe two-dimensional Bose gas undergoes a significant change at low temperatures but only\nin the finite case. Thus, it is not what may be termed a \"conventional\"phase transition\nas for the three-dimensional Bose gas, since it ceases to exist in the thermodynamic limit.\nHowever, from an experimental perspective, a system is never truly in the thermodynamic\nlimit, and so, what we have termed a \"pseudo-condensation\"is expected. This also, therefore, casts doubt on the use of the heat capacity as a means of identifying phase transitions,\nas discussed above.\nAs a final note, we would like to consider some of the outstanding problems. The above\nanalysis is a simple one and deals with only the ideal two-dimensional gas. There is still\nconsiderable debate whether such behaviour is to be found for an interacting two-dimensional\ngas. Some authors31 have claimed that there is a true condensation for the finite interacting\n2D system at sufficiently low temperatures as the coherence length becomes larger than the\ncondensate size. Others, however, have claimed that any phase transition would disappear\nin the presence of particle interactions32 , as predicted by the Hohenberg theorem. Clearly,\n12\n\n\fthe presence of interactions will modify our results greatly. As yet, however, there is no\nindication if there is any correspondence between the two-dimensional Fermi and Bose gases,\nwhen they are interacting, and further, if a pseudo-condensation is to be found for the finite\nBose gas. Further, similar analogues exist in other dimensions for ideal gases in a trapping\npotential32,33 . It would be interesting to debate whether there are deeper implications due\nto the Fermi-Bose correspondence, and where such an situation occurs, it is a special unique\ncase. This is an area of active work, with new experimental innovations making the resolution\nof the above problems and the elucidation of two-dimensional gases only a matter of time\nnow.\n\n\u2217\n\nEmail:amarendra.swarup@ic.ac.uk\n\n1\n\nK.
