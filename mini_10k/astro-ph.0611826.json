Understanding the formation sequence of the Galaxy is largely dependent upon accurately knowing the ages of\nits constituents. There are two main techniques for independently determining the ages of\nstellar populations: main sequence (MS) evolution theory (via cluster isochrones) and white\ndwarf (WD) cooling theory. Ages determined from the MS turnoff (MSTO) of globular clusters provide the most reliable age of the Galactic halo (e.g., Chaboyer et al. 1996), while\nWD cooling ages provide the most reliable age of the Galactic disk (Winget et al. 1987;\n1\n\nWIYN Open Cluster Study XXX\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nOswalt et al. 1996; Leggett et al. 1998; Knox et al. 1999). Before ages determined by these\ntwo techniques can be meaningfully compared, they must be calibrated to the same absolute\nscale. The best way to do this is to measure and compare WD ages and MSTO ages in\nseveral open clusters with a wide range of ages and metallicities.\nCluster WD ages are determined by observing the coolest WDs in the cluster. There is\na simple relationship between the cooling time (which is comparable to its total age for the\noldest WDs, given their short MS lifetimes) and the luminosity of a WD. Therefore, once the\ncoolest WDs are found, the age of the cluster can be determined. The first studies to apply\nthis technique in open clusters were done by Claver (1995) and von Hippel, Gilmore, & Jones\n(1995). Later studies (Richer et al. 1998; von Hippel & Gilmore 2000; von Hippel 2001;\nClaver et al. 2002) showed good agreement in WD ages and MS ages for clusters up to 4\nGyr. A summary of these studies and techniques has recently been presented by von Hippel\n(2005).\nThis current technique to derive open cluster ages using WDs is observationally challenging. The coolest WDs are intrinsically faint (MV \u2265 16), limiting observations to clusters\nwithin a few kiloparsecs, and space-based observations are required for the oldest clusters,\nparticularly to obtain morphological information to remove contaminating background galaxies. To obtain WD ages of more distant clusters (thus increasing the available sample for\nstudy), and to reduce the need for space-based observations, we have been motivated to explore new ways to obtain age information from the cluster WDs. One solution is to explore\nwhat age information, if any, is available in the brighter cluster WDs.\nIf successful, the payoff of a technique to derive ages based on only the bright WDs is\ngreat. Cluster WD ages will be obtained more routinely because the brighter WDs are easier\nto observe and deep ground-based data will often suffice. By relying less on space-based\ndata, we will be able to obtain ages for more clusters (as obtaining spaced-based data is very\ncompetitive) which will push our calibration of WD and MSTO ages further. Also, using the\nbright WDs means that we can observe clusters at greater distances, increasing the number of\nclusters available for study. This technique would allow WDs to be an increasingly powerful\nand effective tool for determining ages.\nFor reasons to be discussed in more detail in the following sections, ages we have derived\nusing the bright WDs are precise, relative ages, rather than accurate, absolute ages. Like\nother age indicators, we will need to perform extensive calibrations before this age indicator\ncan be used as an absolute chronometer.\nThis paper is organized as follows: we discuss the rationale behind and techniques used\nto explore the bright WD idea in Section 2. In Section 3 we present results obtained from our\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmodeling and Bayesian analysis, as well as present preliminary constraints on the precision\nand completeness required to obtain good ages. We end with concluding remarks in Section\n4.\n\n2.\n\nAges from the Bright Cluster WDs\n\nIn Figure 1 we present several color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for simulated clusters\nof varying ages, along with an expanded view of the region of the bright WDs. It is clear from\nthis figure that in the regime of the brighter WDs there are subtle differences in the slope\nand position relative to the MS of the WD cooling sequences for clusters of different ages.\nThese differences are what make it possible to extract age information without observing to\nthe WD terminus.\n\n2.1.\n\nRationale of the Bright WD Idea\n\nWhat is the physical reason for the slope differences of the WD cooling sequence in\nthe CMD? Assuming the mapping between a WD's mass and its MS counterpart's mass\nis universal and single-valued, younger clusters have higher mass TO stars, and therefore\nhigher mass bright WDs. The overall mass of a WD affects its position on the CMD; e.g.,\nhigher mass WDs have smaller radii and are therefore fainter.\nThis mapping between a WD's mass and its MS mass is known as the Initial-Final Mass\nRelation (IFMR). Ages determined using the traditional cool WD method, as described\nbriefly in Section 1, have little dependence on the IFMR. However, the IFMR greatly affects\nthe hot, bright WDs. The shape and position of the WD cooling sequence relative to the MS\nin the bright WD regime is a mass effect. Therefore, if there is significant cluster-to-cluster\nvariation in the IFMR, the bright WD technique breaks down. However, it is the general\nconsensus among researchers that the IFMR is single-valued and the same cluster-to-cluster\n(Weidemann 2000). Because of this dependence on the IFMR, this technique is a relative\nage indicator. Once the IFMR becomes convincingly single-valued and accurately calibrated,\nthis technique could yield absolute ages.\nIn Figure 2 we plot just the expanded WD region of Figure 1. Overlaid in this figure\nare cooling tracks of constant WD mass, i.e., the cooling track of an individual WD with\na given (fixed) mass, plotted here for several masses. As illustrated in the figure, the WD\nisochrones (represented here by various symbols) make a cut across a different combination\nof WD cooling tracks depending on the cluster's age, giving rise to differences in slope and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nposition relative to the MS. As age increases, WDs follow successively lower mass cooling\ntracks. These differences are what we exploit to derive ages from just the bright cluster\nWDs.\nTo state it another way, given a fixed magnitude range, the range of WD masses varies\ndepending on the cluster's age. In younger clusters, the mass range is much wider in the\nbright WD regime than it is in older clusters. This mass dependence is the cause of the\nobserved curvature in the WD cooling sequence. The effect is a direct consequence of the\nIFMR, the mass-radius relation for WDs, and the effect of the Stefan-Boltzmann law in the\nCMD.\n\n2.2.\n\nTesting the Bright WD Idea\n\nIn order to explore the age information available in the photometry of the bright cluster\nWDs, we simulated open cluster CMDs, removed the stars that have been traditionally used\nfor their age information, i.e., the turn off stars and the faintest WDs, and then analyzed the\nremaining, incomplete CMDs with a new Bayesian algorithm, currently under development\nby our group (von Hippel et al. 2006). This process is outlined in detail below.\nFirst, we simulated a cluster with a given age, metallicity, distance, and reddening. The\nsimulations incorporate a Miller & Scalo (1979) initial mass function (IMF), MS and giant\nbranch stellar evolution timescales of Girardi et al. (2000), the IFMR of Weidemann (2000),\nWD cooling timescales of Wood (1992), and WD atmospheres colors from Bergeron et al.\n(1995). It should be noted that other model ingredients could be used, e.g., a different IMF\nor a different WD cooling model, but our results would not change since the morphology\nof the bright WD region in the CMD would remain essentially the same. Additionally\nwe note that all simulated cluster WDs used here are hydrogen-rich, DA WDs. This is\nan adequate assumption; while 7% of the field WDs are DBs (Kleinman et al. 2004), no\nDBs have been found in open clusters to date (Kalirai et al. 2005). Although it should be\nnoted that Williams et al. (2006) have recently presented the discovery of a hot DQ (a WD\nwith a He-dominated atmosphere with opacity dominated by atomic carbon) in the open\ncluster M35. However, even with this discovery, DAs still overwhelmingly dominate nonDAs in open clusters, making our assumption to exclude non-DAs in our simulations a valid\napproximation.\nOur models do not include effects due to residual nuclear burning in the surface layers\nof the WD. Iben and MacDonald (1986) explored the effects of the mass of the hydrogen\nsurface layer on the luminosity of the WD. They found that the luminosity from nuclear\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nreactions (LCN + Lpp ) adds very little to the overall luminosity of the star. As the WD cools,\nthe effect is less than or of order 10%. Slight systematic changes to the shape of the WD\ncooling sequence due to this effect will be higher order for the relative ages we are deriving.\nAs we calibrate the bright WD method to obtain absolute ages, our observations of hot\ncluster WDs will help us further understand exactly how residual nuclear burning affects the\nshape of the WD cooling sequence.\nAdditionally, we have not included field stars in our simulations thus far. This is done\nmainly for simplicity in the early exploration of the new technique. As we continue to explore\nthe technique and further our simulations, we will incorporate field stars.\nAfter we simulated a cluster, we introduced observational scatter and CMD incompleteness into the simulated cluster. For a given limiting S/N, we calculated Gaussian photometric\nerrors for each star in the CMD. Various values for the S/N and lower MV (cutoff) were used\nto allow us to determine the sensitivity of the technique to photometric errors and the level\nof completeness required to still derive meaningful ages. We will discuss these results more\nextensively in Section 3. We also imposed an upper MV (cutoff) = 6 to ensure that our\nBayesian algorithm was not able to derive any age information from the MSTO.\nFinally, we applied our Bayesian technique to the simulated, scattered, and incomplete\nCMD. Based on this, MCMC sampled the posterior distribution of the age of the cluster\n(in log space), as well as the posterior distributions of other cluster parameters, namely\nmetallicity, distance, and reddening. Here, MCMC was set to run for 1,000,000 iterations.\nThe burn in period, that is, the time it takes MCMC to stabilize, was typically 20,000\niterations. Once the posterior distribution of the cluster's age was sufficiently sampled, we\ncalculated the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution and compared these\nstatistics with the known age from the original simulation. (All statistics were calculated\nusing values after the burn in period.)\nTo understand the dependence of this new technique on various factors (e.g., S/N requirements, CMD completeness requirements, number of WDs required), we ran tests for\nclusters of several different ages with different photometric precision, CMD completeness,\nvarying number of cluster members, etc. The simulated cluster ages ranging from log (age)\n= 8.3 to 9.5 (i.e., 0.2 Gyr to 3 Gyr); all clusters assumed no reddening (i.e., AV = 0), a\ndistance modulus of 0.02 , and solar metallicity. In the following section we describe each\npoint tested in detail.\n2\n\nThe distance modulus we chose to use is arbitrary since we apply photometric errors to stars as a function\nof their absolute magnitude. We chose (m-M) = 0.0 so we can consistently refer to absolute, rather than\napparent, magnitude.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nBecause we set the age of each simulated cluster, it is straightforward to compare the\nprecision of the MCMC output as a function of various parameters, including limiting S/N,\nnumber of WDs, and input precision of other cluster parameters. We discuss each of these\npoints individually below.\nNote that throughout we are discussing the precision of the ages obtained with the\nbright WDs rather than the accuracy. We utilize the morphology of the bright WDs relative\nto the MS, and as a result, we are not claiming absolute, externally accurate ages. Before\nthat is possible, a calibration of this technique with other techniques (e.g., MSTO ages) must\nbe performed.\n\n3.1.\n\nS/N Requirement\n\nWe performed tests of the bright WD idea with several limiting S/N levels. This was\ndone in order to understand the dependence of age precision on limiting S/N, and to test if\nit is possible to obtain acceptable age precision with realistically achievable S/N levels. For\nclusters of log (age) = 8.3, 8.6, 9.0, 9.3, and 9.5, and given input values of [Fe/H] = 0.0 \u00b1\n0.3 dex, AV = 0.0 to 0.2 magnitudes, (m \u2212 M) = 0.0 \u00b1 0.1 magnitudes, and an MV (cutoff)\n= 12, we test age precision versus S/N in Figure 3. The number of WDs in each cluster\nvaried due to the stochastic nature of the simulations.\nAs expected, precision in age results improved as the S/N increased. These results are\nencouraging, as it demonstrates that age precision of 20% can be achieved at even the lowest\nS/N we tested, here S/N = 15, and age precision of 10% is achievable by only modestly\nimproving the S/N to 30. Because achieving photometric S/N levels \u2265 100 are difficult, we\nlimited further testing to S/N levels from \u2248 30 to 703 .\n3\n\nBecause achieving photometric accuracy of better than 1\u20132% is very difficult, we discuss internal\nprecision only. The bright WD technique is constrained by the position of the WD sequence relative to\nthe MS; and because absolute photometric errors cause all stars within the CMD to suffer the same offset,\nthe relative position of the WD sequence and the MS will remain the same. Thus, the technique relies most\nheavily on internal precision rather than external accuracy. Nonetheless, we do not focus on precision better\nthan achievable accuracy levels.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.2.\n\nRequired Number of WDs\n\nHow many WDs are required for the bright WD technique to yield useful results? To\ntest the dependence of our new technique on the number of bright WDs, we simulated several\nclusters (all with an age of 1 Gyr and S/N = 45 at MV (cutoff) = 12) with a varying number\nof WDs populating the hot end of the WD cooling sequence. We present results of the\nprecision in age versus the number of WDs in Figure 4.\nAs evident in Figure 4, the greater the number of WDs, the better the age precision.\nThese results show that an age precision of 10% can be determined with as few as four WDs.\n\n3.3.\n\nCMD Completeness Requirement\n\nSo far we have tested the bright WD technique assuming MV (cutoff) = 12. However,\nwhen obtaining real data, the WD cooling sequence may be either more or less complete.\nWe therefore explore the dependence of age precision on CMD completeness. To test this,\nwe simulated several clusters of various ages, imposing incompleteness at MV = 11, 12, and\n13 with a photometric S/N of 45 at MV (cutoff). Again, the number of WDs in each cluster\nvaried based on the individual simulations.\nWe show the results in the top panel (A) of Figure 5. The plotted points represent\nthe averages of the results of many individual simulations in that particular location of\nparameter space; the error bars are the standard deviations of the results. As expected, as\nthe MV (cutoff) becomes fainter and more WDs are included, the age precision increases.\nFor clusters of 1 Gyr, MV (cutoff) = 12 (13) typically yields an age precision of \u2264 10% (5%).\nFor younger clusters good results can be achieved even at MV (cutoff) = 11, e.g., for log\n(age) = 8.6, the typical age precision is 10%.\n\n3.4.\n\nPrecision of [Fe/H] and Other Priors\n\nThe Bayesian technique requires prior information on inputs such as distance, metallicity, and reddening. How sensitive are the results to these priors? That is, how precisely\ndo we need to know cluster metallicity, distance, or reddening for the bright WD technique\nto be useful? In addition to age, the method recovers posterior distributions of metallicity, distance, and reddening. The widths of the posterior distributions of these quantities\nare substantially narrower than the priors, indicating that all the requisite information is\ncontained in the CMD.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFor example, we simulated clusters with an age of 1 Gyr and an MV (cutoff) = 12. We\nchose metallicity precisions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 dex. We display the relationship\nbetween age precision and precision of input metallicity in the middle panel (B) of Figure\n5. As in the top panel of the figure, the points represent the averages of age results from\nmany simulations with the standard deviations represented by the error bars. Results show\nlittle, if any, dependence between the prior precision on metallicity and the age determined\nfrom the bright WDs. This does not mean that cluster metallicities are unimportant in this\nwork. On the contrary, we hope to eventually test cluster MS ages versus cluster WD ages\nat a range of metallicities. Rather, good cluster metallicities are not required for a precise\nbright WD age.\n\n3.5.\n\nAge Range\n\nAs mentioned in Section 2.1, as a cluster ages, the slope of its WD cooling sequence\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from other old clusters. Because of this, we desired\nto understand how the precision of the bright WD age varied as a function of increasing age.\nWe show the results of this in panel C of Figure 5. We have not yet tested any ages older\nthan log (age) = 9.5 (i.e., 3 Gyr) due to limitations in our input models; however, as we\nincorporate more high mass WD cooling models, we will continue to push this technique to\ngreater ages.\nWe display the results in the bottom panel (C) of Figure 5. As usual, the points are the\naverages of several simulations with the standard deviations given by the error bars. Based\non this figure, we see that for the ages tested, the age precision of the bright WD technique\ndoes not significantly decrease with increasing age. Further testing will be done to determine\nthis effect for clusters of ages above 3 Gyr, placing an important constraint on the technique.\nAs the age of a cluster increases, two main factors contribute to the age precision. The\nfirst is that as the cluster becomes older, there are more WDs. As demonstrated in Section\n3.2 (particularly Figure 4), as the number of WDs increases, so does the age precision.\nCompeting with this effect is that as the cluster ages, the bright portion of its WD cooling\nsequence becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from other old clusters (see Figures 1\nand 2). It is possible that there exists a \"sweet spot,\" where these two effects complement\neach other and contribute to a very precise age. This may be the cause of the sudden\ntightness in age precision around log (age) = 9.3 in Figure 5. However, as a cluster increases\nin age, the number of WDs quickly begins to do little to improve age precision while the\nWD sequences become more and more degenerate. Further testing, particularly expanding\ntests out to older clusters, will more clearly help us understand this effect and constrain the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nbright WD technique.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nCurrent observational techniques to obtain ages from cluster WDs are challenging, due\nto the faintness of the coolest cluster WDs. We have shown that the bright WDs can be used\nto determine cluster ages. This is done by exploiting the differences in slope and position\nrelative to the MS of the WD cooling sequence in the regime of the bright WDs caused by\nvarying WD mass distributions. By employing a new Bayesian technique to fully extract all\nage information in the WD portion of the CMD, we have shown that there is sufficient age\ninformation in the bright WDs.\nWith the assumption of a single-valued IFMR, our studies show that we can achieve\nage precision of 10% with a S/N \u2265 30 at MV (cutoff) = 12, with as few as 4 WDs for\nlow reddening clusters. We find no dependence of age precision on the prior precision of\nmetallicity, distance, and reddening, nor on the age of the cluster, at least up to the oldest\nage (3 Gyr) tested in this study. Additional studies will be done to determine if this technique\nis feasible for even older ages, particularly ages comparable to those of the globular clusters.\nIf the bright WDs technique continues to be successful in determining precise cluster\nages, WD cosmochronometry can be applied to more distant and/or older clusters (where\nobserving to the WD terminus is especially challenging). This will increase the sample of\nobjects available for study, particularly allowing us to sample clusters in age-metallicity\nspace that would be otherwise too difficult using the current method of determining WD\nages. This technique will allow WDs to be an increasingly powerful and effective tool for\nstudying the ages of stellar populations.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration under Grant No. NAG5-13070 issued through the Office of Space Science,\nand by the National Science Foundation through Grant AST-0307315.\n\nREFERENCES\nBergeron, P., Wesemael, F., & Beauchamp, A. 1995, PASP, 107, 1047\nChaboyer, B., Demarque, P., & Sarajedini, A. 1996, ApJ, 459, 558\nClaver, C.
