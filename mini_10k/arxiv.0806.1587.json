'Continuous'\nmeans that the opinion is in its essence a vector of d \u2208 N real numbers. An example for a continuous opinion is a budget plan proposal, where a fixed amount\nof money is distributed to d departements. Other examples are prices for products or an estimate of an unknown fact, like the number of humans on earth in\n2050.\nConsider further on that the agents are willing to adjust their opinion towards the opinions of others. Adjustment of a continuous opinion can be well\ndescribed by computing a weighted arithmetic mean of other agent's opinions.\n\u2217 Email: post@janlo.de, present adress: ETH Z\u00fcrich, Chair of Systems Design, Kreuzplatz 5, 8032 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland\n\n1\n\n\fA process of continuous opinion dynamics can be seen as repeated averaging of\nopinions.\nIf the averaging weights are fixed (as in [8, 3, 4]) then the process can be\nmapped to x(t+1) = Ax(t) with x(0) being the n-dimensional vector of opinions\nand A being a row-stochastic matrix which represents the averaging weights for\neach agent in a row. The central research question was about conditions for\nreaching consensus.\nKrause [13] invented a nonlinear bounded confidence model based on this\nlinear model in 1997. Agents give positive weights to other agents only when\nthey are close in opinion to their own opinion. So, agents may change their\nweights dynamically. Analytical conditions for convergence to consensus are\nonly possible for very low number of agents [12], so in the next step extensive\ncomputer simulations have been done together with Hegselmann [11]. Then, the\nmodel got a lot of attention and is now mostly referenced as the HegselmannKrause model.\nIndependently, Deffuant and others invented a similar bounded confidence\nmodel working on a project [7, 6]about improving agri-environmental policies in\n2000. Partly inspired by Axelrod [1] and particle physics they proposed a model\nof random pairwise interaction, where agents compromise if their opinions differ\nnot too much.\nBoth models differ a lot in the detail (e.g. one is stochastic, one is deterministic) but are on the other hand similar in spirit, because they both make\na 'bounded confidence'-assumption for the agents. They can be represented as\nspecial cases in a general model [21]. For this general model it is possible to\nprove convergence to a limit opinion configuration [15]. But the proof does not\nuse the bounded confidence assumption and nothing has been said about the\nset of all possible limit opinion configurations. This paper is to show the set of\nfixed points for both models (Section 2). Although the answer is quite plausible\nthe proof for the Hegselmann-Krause model is not trivial.\nFurther on, both models have been redefined as density-based models. The\nidea goes back to Ben-Naim et al [2] in 2002 for the Deffuant-Weisbuch model\nand has been copied for the Hegselmann-Krause model [9]. Both can be approximated as state-discrete interactive Markov chains as done in [14, 16, 19]\ninspired by [5]. It has been seen in simulation that the density-based models\nalso converge to limit opinion formations. Both types of limit formations are of\nthe same heuristic type. But a proof of convergence is lacking.\nThis paper is furthermore to show the set of fixed points for the densitybased models in their approxiamtion as interactive Markov chain (Section 3).\nAgain the answer is quite plausible but the proof for the Hegselmann-Krause\nmodel is not trivial. The results for the fixed points of the interactive Markov\nchains are the central result of this paper.\nIn dynamical systems analysis it is natural to start finding the set of fixed\npoints. Fixed points are stable opinion configurations. We guess that the processes in the agent-based as well as density-based model converge to one point\nin their set of fixed points. There is strong evidence from simulation for this\nconjecture, but a proof is lacking for the density-based models. As a starting\n2\n\n\fpoint, we present a Lyapunov function which ensures that the density-based\ndynamics of the Deffuant-Weisbuch model can not have cycles.\nThe proofs for the fixed points of the interactive Markov chains rely on\ndefining the difference equation which serves as a sort of discrete master equation\nwhich give gain and loss terms for each opinion class.\n\n2\n\nAgent-based bounded confidence models\n\nLet us consider a set of n \u2208 N agents which hold continuous opinions. An\nopinion is a real number or respectively a vector of d \u2208 N real numbers. The\nopinion space is thus S \u2282 Rd . Usually S is compact and convex. The opinion of\nagent i \u2208 n at time t \u2208 N is xi (t) \u2208 S, and the vector x(t) \u2208 S n is the opinion\nprofile at time t. Notice that x(t) \u2208 (Rd )n is a vector of vectors for d > 1.\nFigure 1 shows visualisations for the dynamics in one time step of both\nprocesses in a two dimensional triangular opinion space1\n\nFigure 1: Visualisation for HK (left) and DW (right) dynamics in agent-based\nrepresentation.\n\n2.1\n\nAgent-based Hegselmann-Krause model\n\nLet there be n \u2208 N agents and an appropriate opinion space S \u2282 Rd .\nGiven an initial profile x(0) \u2208 S n , bound of confidence \u03b5 > 0 and a norm k*k\nwe define the HK process (x(t))t\u2208N recursively through\nx(t + 1) = A(x(t), \u03b5)x(t),\n\n(1)\n\nwith A(x, \u03b5) being the confidence matrix defined\n\u001a\n1\nif j \u2208 I\u03b5 (i, x)\n#I\u03b5 (i,x)\nAij (x, \u03b5) :=\n0\notherwise,\nwith I\u03b5 (i, x) := {j \u2208 n | xi \u2212 xj \u2264 \u03b5}.\n1 This opinion space could represent a simplex where opinions are proposals for the allocation of a fixed amount of money to three projects. See [17, 18] for simualtion results and the\nimpact of the dimension in simplex opinion space.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nAgent-based Deffuant-Weisbuch model\n\nLet there be n \u2208 N agents and an opinion space S \u2282 Rd convex. Given an initial\nprofile x(0) \u2208 S n , bound of confidence \u03b5 > 0, and a norm k*k we define the DW\nprocess as the random process (x(t))t\u2208N that chooses in each time step t \u2208 N\ntwo random agents i, j which perform the action\n\u001a 1 j\ni\ni\nj\n2 (x (t) + x (t)) if x (t) \u2212 x (t) \u2264 \u03b5\nxi (t + 1) =\ni\nx (t)\notherwise.\nThe same for xj (t + 1) with i and j interchanged.\n\n2.3\n\nThe set of fixed points in agent-based models\n\nWe call x\u2217 \u2208 (Rd )n a fixed point of the HK model if A(x\u2217 , \u03b5)x\u2217 = x\u2217 . We call\nx\u2217 \u2208 (Rd )n a fixed point of the DW model if for all choices i, j \u2208 n the profile\nx\u2217 does not change if agents i and j communicate. Further, F HK \u2282 (Rd )n and\nF DW \u2282 (Rd )n are the sets of fixed points of the corresponding models.\nIn the following we describe these sets and show that they are equal. The\nproof for the DW model is trivial while the proof for the HK model needs a\nlittle bit of care. It relies on the finiteness of the number of agents.\nThe following lemma will be helpful. Beforehand we define for an opinion\nprofile x \u2208 (Rd )n and two agents i, j \u2208 n as Hij \u2282 Rd the hyperplane that\n+\nis orthogonal to xj \u2212 xi which goes through xj , and Hij\n\u2282 Rd is the closed\nhalf-space defined by Hij which does not contain xi .\nLemma 1. Let x\u2217 \u2208 (Rd )n be a fixed point of the homogeneous HK model\nwith bound of confidence \u03b5 > 0. Let there be i, j \u2208 n with xi 6= xj such that\n+\n. Then there exists\ni \u2208 I\u03b5 (j, x) and let there be k \u2208 n such that xk 6\u2208 Hij\n+\nm\nm \u2208 I\u03b5 (j, x) different from i, j, k such that x \u2208 Hkj .\nProof. We abbreviate x := x\u2217 . Due to x being a fixed point it must hold that\nxj =\n\n1\n#I\u03b5 (j, x)\n\nX\n\nxs .\n\ns\u2208I\u03b5 (j,x)\n\nSo, xj is the barycenter of all the opinions in of agents in the confidence set\n+\n+\nI\u03b5 (j, x). By definition i \u2208 I\u03b5 (j, x). Due to the fact that k 6\u2208 Hij\nand that Hij\nis\n+\n\u03c0\ni\nj\nk\nj\nclosed, the angle between x \u2212 x and x \u2212 x is less then 2 and thus i 6\u2208 Hkj .\n(See Figure 2 for a visualisation.)\nThere must be at least one more agent in I\u03b5 (j, x) besides i and j, because\notherwise xj is not the barycenter of xi and xj . If all these other agents were\n+\nnot in Hjk\nthen xj would be an extreme point2 of the convex hull of the opinions\n+\nof the agents in I\u03b5 (j, x). Thus, there must be m \u2208 I\u03b5 (j, x) such that xm \u2208 Hjk\nand m 6= j.\n2 See\n\nRockafellar [20] for convex analysis.\n\n4\n\n\f+\n+\nFigure 2: Visualisation of Hij\nand Hkj\n.\n\nProposition 2. Let \u03b5 > 0 be a bound of confidence which defines the homogeneous HK model and the DW model on the opinion space (Rd )n . It holds\nthat\nF HK = F DW = {x \u2208 (Rd )n | \u2200i, j \u2208 n : xi \u2212 xj\n\np\n\n> \u03b5 or xi = xj }.\n\n(2)\n\nProof. If x is in the set as described in (2) each two agents either reached\nconsensus or are too far away from each other to interact. Thus, x is a fixed\npoint in the DW and in the HK model.\nLet x be not in the set as described in (2) then there are i, j \u2208 n such that\nxi \u2212 xj p \u2264 \u03b5 and xi 6= xj .\nThen x can not be a fixed point of the DW model, because if i, j are chosen\nas communication partners both agents will move towards each other.\nIt remains to show that x cannot be a fixed point of the HK model. We\nassume that x is a fixed point of the HK model and derive a contradiction.\n+\nwith\nDue to Lemma 1 there exists m0 \u2208 I\u03b5 (j, x) with xm0 \u2208 Hij\nxi \u2212 xm0\n\n2\n\n> xi \u2212 xj\n\n2\n\n(we set k in the lemma equal to i). Now we apply the lemma again for j \u2208\n+\n+\nI\u03b5 (m0 , x). Then obviously i 6\u2208 Hjm\n, and thus there is m1 \u2208 Him\nsuch that\n0\n0\nxi \u2212 xm1 2 > xi \u2212 xm0 2 . We can conclude like this to derive a sequence of\nagents m0 , m1 , m2 , . . . such that xi \u2212 xm0 2 < xi \u2212 xm1 2 < xi \u2212 xm2 2 <\n. . . . This is a contradiction to the finiteness of the number of agents.\nFigure 3 gives impressions how the set of fixed points F HK and F DW looks\nfor the opinion space [0, 1] \u2282 R (so d = 1), n = 2, 3 and \u03b5 = 0.3.\nFor higher n (but still d = 1) one can imagine this set like: Take the whole\nstate space Rn and remove successively points. First, take all subspaces where\nnumbers in two dimensions must be equal and remove the closed \u03b5-region around\nthis subspaces from the whole space but keep the subspaces itself. Then take\nfrom every of these subspaces all subspaces where either a third number must\nbe equal to the former two, or two other numbers must be equal and remove\ntheir \u03b5-region but keep the subspaces them self. Continuing like this spans a\n5\n\n\f\u03b5 = 0.3\n\n\u03b5 = 0.2\n\n1\n1\n\n0.8\n\nx3\n\nx2\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx2\n\nx1\n\n0 0\n\n0.5\nx1\n\nFigure 3: The set of fixed points F HK and F DW for the opinion space [0, 1] \u2282 R\n(so d = 1), n = 2, 3 and \u03b5 = 0.3. The red line represents all consensus points.\nThe blue patches all points where two agents found consensus, while the other\nis far enough away. The gray regions represent all fixed points where each\nagent has an individual opinion. The 'invisible' space are thus all points where\ndynamics happen.\nlattice of subspaces which is of the same kind as the lattice of partitions of the\nset {1, 2, . . . , n}. The number of subspaces to treat is much bigger than n it is\ndetermined by the Bell numbers.\n\n3\n\nDensity-based bounded confidence models\n\nIn the following we reformulate the Hegselmann-Krause model and DeffuantWeisbuch model for a one-dimensional opinion space as density-based models\nwith the same heuristics as in the agent-based model. We approximate densitybased dynamics as interactive Markov chains as first outlined in [14].\nInstead of concrete agents and their opinions we define the state of the system as a density function on the opinion space which evolves in time. As a\nsimplification we only regard a one-dimensional interval as opinion space and\ndiscretise it into n subintervals which serve as opinion classes. So, we switch\nfrom n agents with opinions in the opinion space to an idealized infinite population, which is divided to the opinion classes n = {1, . . . , n}.\nClass i contains a fraction of the total population pi . For convenience we\ndefine pi = 0 for all i \u2208\n/ n. A vector p(t) \u2208 Rn represents the opinion distribution\nat time t \u2208 N. Naturally, the fractions in the classes should sum up to one. So,\nn\u22121\nthe state\n= {p \u2208\nPn space in a density-based model is a simplex. We define \u25b3\nRn\u22650 | i=1 pi = 1}. One should think of an opinion distribution as a row vector.\nIf we define transition probabilities from one class to another we can represent the opinion dynamics process as an interactive Markov chain with transition\n\n6\n\n\fmatrix B(p(t)). It is called 'interactive' because the transition matrix depends\non the actual state of the system.\nLet n be a set of opinion classes and p(0) \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn be an initial opinion\ndistribution. A density-based process is defined as an interactive Markov chain\np(t + 1) = p(t)B(p(t))\n\n(3)\n\nwith the explicit definition of the transition matrix function. In the following\nwe give B HK (p(t)) for the HK model and B DW (p(t)) for the DW model.\n\n3.1\n\nDensity-based Hegselmann-Krause transition matrix\n\nWe need some preliminary definitions to define the transition matrix for the\ninteractive Markov chain with communication of repeated meetings like in the\nHegselmann-Krause model.\nLet I = {i, .+1\n. ., j} \u2282 n be a discrete interval and p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 be an opinion\ndistribution. We call\nX\nMI0 (p) :=\npk the I-mass (or 0th moment) of p,\nk\u2208I\n\nMI1 (p) :=\n\nX\n\nkpk the first I-moment of p and\n\nk\u2208I\n\nMIbary (p)\n\n:=\n\n(\n\nMI1 (p)\n,\nMI0 (p)\nmax I+min I\n,\n2\n\nif pI 6= 0,\nif pI = 0.\n\nthe I-barycenter of p.\n\nLet p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 be an opinion distribution and \u01eb \u2208 N be a discrete bound of\nconfidence. For i \u2208 n we abbreviate the \u01eb-local mean as\nbary\nMi := M{i\u2212\u01eb,\n(p)\n+1\n...,i+\u01eb}\n\nWe define the HK transition matrix as\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2308Mi \u2309 \u2212 Mi\nHK\nBij (p, \u01eb) :=\nM\n\uf8f4\ni \u2212 \u230aMi \u230b\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\nif j = Mi ,\nif j = \u230aMi \u230b, j 6= Mi ,\nif j = \u2308Mi \u2309, j =\n6 Mi ,\notherwise.\n\nEach row of the transition matrix B HK (p, \u01eb) contains only one or two adjacent positive entries. The population with opinion i goes completely to the\n\u01eb-local mean opinion if this is an integer. Otherwise they distribute to the two\nadjacent opinions. The fraction which goes to the lower (upper) opinion class\ndepends on how close the \u01eb-local mean lies to it. Thus, the heuristic of averaging all opinions in a local area is represented. Figure 4 may give a hint how\ndynamics work.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: Visualisation of dynamics in density-based models. HK right, DW\nleft\n\n3.2\n\nDensity-based Deffuant-Weisbuch transition matrix\n\nThe Deffuant-Weisbuch transition matrix for an opinion distribution p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 ,\na discrete bound of confidence \u01eb \u2208 N is defined by\n( i\ni\n\u03c02j\u2212i+1\n\u03c02j\u2212i\u22121\ni\n+\n\u03c0\n+\n, if i 6= j,\nDW\n2j\u2212i\n2\n2\nBij (p, \u01eb, \u03bc)\nqi ,\nif i = j.\nwith qi = 1 \u2212\n\nPn\n\nj6=i,j=1\n\nDW\nBij\n(p, \u01eb, \u03bc)ij and\ni\n\u03c0m\n\n:=\n\n\u001a\n\npm , if |i \u2212 m| \u2264 \u01eb\n0,\notherwise\n\nRemember that we defined pi = 0 for all i 6\u2208 n.\nWe briefly describe how the agent-based heuristics of the Deffuant-Weisbuch\nmodel governs the transition matrix of the interactive Markov chain. By the\nfounding idea of the model an agent with opinion i moves to the new opinion\nj if he compromises with an agent with opinion i + 2(j \u2212 i) = 2j \u2212 i. The\nprobability to communicate with an agent with opinion 2j \u2212 i is of course p2j\u2212i .\nThus, the heuristic of random pairwise interaction is represented. The terms\ni\n\u03c0i\n\u03c02j\u2212i\u22121\n, 2j\u2212i+1\n2\n2\n\nstand for the case when agents with opinion i communicate\nwith agents with opinion j, but the distance |i \u2212 j| is odd. In this case the\npopulation should go with probability 21 to one of the two possible opinion\ni+j\nclasses \u230a i+j\n2 \u230b, \u2308 2 \u2309. Figure 4 may give a hint how dynamics work.\n\n3.3\n\nThe set of fixed points in density based models\n\nHere, we will prove that the set of fixed points of the interactive Markov chains\np(t + 1) = p(t)B CR (p(t), \u01eb)\n\n(4)\n\nwith DW and HK transition matrix is\nGHK = GDW = {p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 | pk > 0 \u21d2 pm = 0 for all m \u2208 {k\u2212\u01eb, .+1\n. ., k\u22122, k+2, .+1\n. ., k+\u01eb}\u2229n}.\n(5)\nThe structure of the set of fixed points is thus: all opinion classes with\npositive mass lie in adjacent pairs or isolated. Pairs and isolated classes must\nhave a distance greater than \u01eb to each other. In an adjacent pair of classes in a\n8\n\n\ffixed point there are no further restrictions on the proportion of agents in the\ntwo classes. So, fixed points lie in certain lines in the simplex \u25b3n\u22121 .\nFurther on, we give a Lyapunov-function for the interactive Markov chain\nwith DW transition matrix which rules out cycles. Convergence to fixed point\nremains as conjecture for the DW as well as for the HK transition matrix.\nFor both interactive Markov chains it is useful to look at their difference\nequation, because it can play the role of a discrete master equation (see [10]),\nwhich displays gain and loss terms for the mass changes in one class at one time\nstep.\nLet\n\u2206p := pB CR (p, \u01eb) \u2212 p = p(B CR (p, \u01eb) \u2212 E),\n(6)\nthen the interactive Markov chain is a trajectory of the equation\np(t + 1) = p(t) + \u2206p(t) = p(t) + p(t)(B CR (p(t), \u01eb) \u2212 E).\nAn opinion distribution p\u2217 is a fixed point of the interactive Markov chain (4)\nif p\u2217 = p\u2217 B CR (p\u2217 , \u01eb). Obviously, this is equivalent to \u2206p\u2217 = 0.\n3.3.1\n\nThe Deffuant-Weisbuch model\n\nWe take a look at the difference \u2206p in detail. Simply calculating equation (6)\nwith B CR (p, \u01eb) := B DW (p, \u01eb) leads to the the following explanatory difference\nequation for all k \u2208 n.\n\n\u2206pk =\n\nX\n\npi pj +\n\ni+j\n2 =k,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n|\n\n1\npi pj \u2212\n2\ni+j\n1\n=k\u00b1\n,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n2\n2\n{z\n}\nX\n\nfraction joining state k\n\npk\n\nX\n\npj\n\n(7)\n\n2\u2264|j\u2212k|\u2264\u01eb\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\nfraction leaving state k\n\n(The first two sums go over all (i, j) \u2208 n \u00d7 n, the third over j \u2208 n, under\nrestriction of the equations below.) This is analog to a master equation in\nphysics determining the fraction leaving a state and the fraction joining a state,\nbut discrete in state and time.\nTheorem 3. An opinion distribution p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn is a fixed point of the\ninteractive Markov chain (4) with DW transition matrix and discrete bound of\nconfidence \u01eb \u2208 N if and only if it holds for all k \u2208 n that\npk > 0 \u21d2 pm = 0 for all m \u2208 {k \u2212 \u01eb, .+1\n. ., k \u2212 2, k + 2, .+1\n. ., k + \u01eb} \u2229 n.\n\n(8)\n\nProof. For the 'if'-part let us assume that p is a fixed point and show that (8)\nholds. If p is a fixed point it holds \u2206pk = 0 for all k \u2208 n.\nLet k \u2208 n be such that pk > 0. For an indirect proof let us assume that\nthere is m0 \u2208 {k \u2212 \u01eb, . . . , k \u2212 2, k + 2, . . . , k + \u01eb} \u2229 n such that pm0 > 0 and find\na contradiction.\n\n9\n\n\fWe can conclude from \u2206pk = 0 and equation (7) that it holds\npk\n|{z}\n\nX\n\npj\n\n=\ni+j\n2\n\n2\u2264|j\u2212k|\u2264\u01eb\n\n>0\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\nX\n\npi pj +\ni+j\n2\n\n=k,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\nX\n\n=k\u00b1 21 ,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n1\npi pj\n2\n\n>0 because it contains pm0\n\nThus, on the right hand side one addend pm1 pn1 must be positive. A careful\nlook at the summation index sets will help us to conclude further. If we assume\nwithout loss of generality m1 < n1 then we can conclude m1 < k.\nWe can conclude from \u2206p\u2217m1 = 0 and equation (7) that\np\u2217m\n|{z}1\n>0\n\nX\n\np\u2217j\n\n2\u2264|j\u2212m1 |\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\n=\ni+j\n2\n\nX\n\npi pj +\n\n=m1 ,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\nX\n\ni+j\n1\n2 =m1 \u00b1 2 ,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n1\npi pj\n2\n\n>0 because it contains p\u2217\nn1\n\nThus, on the right hand side one addend pm2 pn2 must be positive again and\nthere is m2 < m1 < k.\nWe conclude by induction until we reach an index mz < 1 for which pmz\nmust be positive \u2013 a contradiction.\nTo prove the 'only if'-part we assume that for all k \u2208 n it holds (8). We have\nto check that \u2206pk = 0 in equation (7) for all k \u2208 n. We see that every addend\n1\nin each equation is of the form pi pj with 2 \u2264 |j \u2212 l| \u2264 \u01eb and i+j\n2 \u2208 {k, k \u00b1 2 }.\nFrom (8) we know that in every case either pi or pj are zero.\nTheorem 4. For every p(0) \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn the interactive DW Markov chain\n(p(t))t\u2208N0 can not be periodic.\nProof. We define a Lyapunov function L : Sn \u2192 R which is continuous and\nstrictly decreasing on (p(t))t\u2208N0 for every initial distribution p(0) as long as we\ndo not reach a fixed point. Let\nL(p) :=\n\nn\nX\n\n2 i pi .\n\ni=1\n\nNow we have to show that for every p which is not a fixed point it holds that\nL(p) > L(pB(p, \u01eb)).\nBecause of the linearity of L we can transform the inequality such that we\nhave to show\n0 > L(pB(p, \u01eb) \u2212 p) = L(\u2206(p)).\nDue to (7) it holds\n\n10\n\n\fL(\u2206p) =\n\nX\n\nk\u2208n\n\n\uf8eb\n\n2k \uf8ed\n\ni+j\n2\n\nX\n\nX\n\npi pj +\n\ni+j\n1\n2 =k\u00b1 2 ,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n=k,2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n\u2212pk\n\nX\n\n2\u2264|j\u2212k|\u2264\u01eb\n\nX\n\n=\n\n(2\n\n\u230a i+j\n2 \u230b\n\n(2\n\n\u230a i+j\n2 \u230b\n\n+2\n\n\u2308 i+j\n2 \u2309\n\n+2\n\n\u2308 i+j\n2 \u2309\n\n)pi pj +\n\n2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1\npi pj\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\npj \uf8f8\n\n(2i + 2j )pi pj\n\n2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\ni\n\n\u2212 2 \u2212 2j )pi pj\n\n2\u2264|i\u2212j|\u2264\u01eb\ni+j\n\ni+j\n\nIt holds (2\u230a 2 \u230b + 2\u2308 2 \u2309 \u2212 2i \u2212 2j ) < 0 for all i, j with |i \u2212 j| \u2265 2 and thus\nit holds L(\u2206pi ) < 0.\nDue to the existence of the Lyapunov function it holds that (p(t))t\u2208N0 can\nnot have cycles. Because if weP\nconsider that there is a period T \u2208 N such that\n\u22121\np(t) = p(t + T ) then the sum t+T\nL(\u2206p(s)) would be negative, but on the\ns=t\nother hand it also holds\nt+T\nX\ns=t\n\nL(\u2206p(t)) =\n\nt+T\nX\n\nL(p(s + 1) \u2212 p(s)) =\n\ns=t\n\nt+T\nX\n\nL(p(s + 1)) \u2212 L(p(s)) = 0.\n\ns=t\n\nThus there is a contradiction to a periodic solution.\nIf one would define a Lyapunov function which is zero on every fixed point\none might prove convergence to a fixed point.\nConjecture. For every p(0) \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn the interactive DW Markov\nchain (p(t))t\u2208N0 converges to a fixed point.\nThere is evidence from simulation for this conjecture [19].\n3.3.2\n\nThe Hegselmann-Krause model\n\nHere we show that the fixed points of the interactive Markov chain (3) with HK\ntransition matrix are the same as for the DW transition matrix.\nWe start with a lemma on the I-barycenters.\nLemma 5. Let p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn be an opinion distribution and discrete intervals\nI0 = {i0 , .+1\n. ., j0 } \u2282 n and I1 = {i1 , .+1\n. ., j1 } \u2282 n. It holds\n(p),\n(p) \u2264 MIbary\n1. i0 \u2264 i1 and j0 \u2264 j1 =\u21d2 MIbary\n1\n0\n2. if i0 \u2264 i1 and j0 \u2264 j1\nMIbary\n(p) < MIbary\n(p) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203m \u2208 (I0 \u222a I1 ) \\ (I0 \u2229 I1 ) with pm > 0.\n0\n1\n\n11\n\n\fProof. In a first step we assume pI0 6= 0 and pI1 6= 0 Thus there is m0 \u2208 I0\nwith pm0 > 0 and one m1 \u2208 I1 with pm1 > 0 thus the following equation is well\ndefined:\nMIbary\n(p) =\n0\n\n=\n\nMI10 (p)\nMI10 (p)MI01 (p) bary\n=\nM\n(p)\nMI00 (p)\nMI00 (p)MI11 (p) I1\nP\nm0 p m0 p m1\n(m0 ,m1 )\u2208I0 \u00d7I1\n\nP\n\nm1 p m0 p m1\n\n(p)\nMIbary\n1\n\n(m0 ,m1 )\u2208I0 \u00d7I1\n\nTo prove (1) we have to show that the fraction in equation (9) is less or equal\nthan one.\nWe compare the summands in the numerator and the denominator. If\nm0 , m1 \u2208 I0 \u2229 I1 then the summands m0 pm0 pm1 and m1 pm0 pm1 appear in\nboth. In all other combination of indices it holds either (m0 , m1 ) \u2208 (I0 \\ I1 ) \u00d7 I1\nor (m0 , m1 ) \u2208 I0 \u00d7 (I1 \\ I0 ). Due to i0 \u2264 i1 and j0 \u2264 j1 it holds m0 < m1 and\nthus the numerator is less or equal to the denominator and the fraction is less\nor equal to one.\nTo prove (2) we have to show that fraction in (9) is strictly less then one.\nThis holds if there is a pair (m0 , m1 ) \u2208 (I0 \\ I1 ) \u00d7 I1 or (m0 , m1 ) \u2208 I0 \u00d7 (I1 \\ I0 )\nfor which pm0 > 0 and pm1 > 0. This is obviously the case due to the claim in\n(2) and the assumption pI0 6= 0 and pI1 6= 0.\nAt least we have to check the case, where pI0 = 0 or pI1 = 0. The same steps\nas in Equation (9) lead with the definition of the local mean to the equations\nP\n2 m\u2208I0 \\I1 mpm\nbc\nP\nM bc (p)\npI0 6= 0, pI1 = 0 \u21d2 MI0 (p) =\n(j1 + i1 ) m\u2208I0 \\I1 pm I1\nP\n(j0 + i0 ) m\u2208I1 \\I0 pm bc\nbc\nP\npI0 = 0, pI1 6= 0 \u21d2 MI0 (p) =\nMI1 (p)\n2 m\u2208I1 \\I0 mpm\npI0 = 0, pI1 = 0\n\n(p) =\n\u21d2 MIbc\n0\n\nj0 + i0 bc\nM (p)\nj1 + i1 I1\n\n(We can choose the summation index sets I0 \\ I1 instead of I0 in the upper\nequation, because all summands with indices out of I0 \u2229 I1 are obviously zero.\nAnalog for the middle equation.) For all three equations we can conclude like\nabove to get 1 and 2.\nFor an opinion distribution p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn and a discrete bound of confibary\ndence \u01eb \u2208 n we recall the abbreviation Mi := M{i\u2212\u01eb,\n(p).

Let p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn be a fixed point of the interactive HK\nMarkov chain (4) with HK transition matrix and let pi > 0 then it holds\neither\nor\nor\n\nMi = i and Ii = {i}\ni < Mi \u2264 Mi+1 < i + 1, pi+1 > 0 and Ii = {i, i + 1} = Ii+1 ,\ni \u2212 1 < Mi\u22121 \u2264 Mi < i, pi\u22121 > 0 and Ii = {i, i \u2212 1} = Ii\u22121\n\nProof. We define p = [p1 . . . pn ].\nIn a first step we will show that i \u2212 1 < Mi < i + 1. Let us assume for an\nindirect proof that Mi \u2265 i + 1.\nThe fact that p is a fixed point implies \u2206p = 0 and thus we can derive from\nEquation (10) that\nX\nX\nX\npj +\n(\u2308Mj \u2309 \u2212 Mj )pj\n(11)\npi =\n(Mj \u2212 \u230aMj \u230b)pj +\n\u2308*\u2309\n\nj\u2208Ii\n\nj\u2208Ii\u2217\n\n\u230a*\u230b\n\nj\u2208Ii\n\nDue to Mi \u2265 i + 1 it holds that i 6\u2208 Ii (the union of all index sets) and due\nto Lemma 5 it holds for j \u2208 Ii that j \u2264 i \u2212 1. Let i1 := max Ii . Thus it is clear\nthat i1 < i, pi1 > 0 and i1 < Mi1 .\nWe conclude further with Equation (10) that\nX\nX\nX\npi1 =\n(Mj \u2212 \u230aMj \u230b)pj +\npj +\n(\u2308Mj \u2309 \u2212 Mj )pj\n(12)\n\u2308*\u2309\n1\n\nj\u2208Ii\n\nj\u2208Ii\u2217\n\n1\n\n13\n\n\u230a*\u230b\n1\n\nj\u2208Ii\n\n\f\u2308*\u2309\n\nIt may i1 \u2208 Ii1 but it holds max Ii1 \u2264 i1 and due to (Mj \u2212 \u230aMj \u230b) < 1 it holds\nthat there must exist i2 := max Ii1 \\ {i1 } with pi2 > 0 and i2 < Mi2 .\nWe derive by induction further on the existence of a decreasing chain of\nindices i > i1 > i2 > . . . with pi > 0, pi1 > 0, pi2 > 0, . . . . Thus there must be\nz < 1 with pz > 0, a contradiction, thus Mi < i + 1.\nIf we assume Mi \u2264 i \u2212 1 we can derive analog that there must be z > n with\npz > 0. Thus we know i \u2212 1 < Mi < i + 1.\nIn the second step we show Mi > i \u21d2 Mi+1 < i + 1, pi+1 > 0. It is clear by\nLemma 5 that Mi+1 \u2265 Mi , lets assume Mi+1 \u2265 i + 1. Then we find (looking at\n\u230a*\u230b\nEquation (11)) that i \u2208 Ii and i + 1 6\u2208 Ii thus we can conclude in the same way\nas after Equation (12) that there exist z < 1 with pz > 0. Thus it follows by\nthis contradiction that Mi+1 < i + 1. Analog we derive Mi < i \u21d2 Mi\u22121 > i \u2212 1\nIn the third step we show that Mi > i implies Ii = {i, i + 1} = Ii+1 and\npi+1 > 0. From equation \u2206p = 0 and Equation (10) we can derive the two\nequations\nX\npositive terms\npi = (\u2308Mi \u2309 \u2212 Mi )pi + (\u2308Mi+1 \u2309 \u2212 Mi+1 )pi+1 +\nj\u2208Ii \\{i,i+1}\n\npi+1\n\n=\n\n(Mi \u2212 \u230aMi \u230b)pi + (Mi+1 \u2212 \u230aMi+1 \u230b)pi+1 +\n\nX\n\npositive terms\n\nj\u2208Ii+1 \\{i,i+1}\n\nIf we add both equations we get by calculation\nX\nX\npositive terms =\n0=\n\npositive terms\n\nj\u2208Ii+1 \\{i,i+1}\n\nj\u2208Ii \\{i,i+1}\n\nand thus Ii \\ {i, i + 1} and Ii+1 \\ {i, i + 1} must be empty. And due i + 1 \u2208 Ii\nit holds pi+1 > 0.\nAnalog, we prove that Mi < i implies Ii = {i\u22121, i} = Ii\u22121 and pi\u22121 > 0.\nSo, for the fixed point p and pi > 0 we know that either Ii = {i} or Ii =\n{i, i + 1} with pi+1 > 0 or Ii = {i \u2212 1, i} with pi\u22121 > 0. We define two new\ndiscrete intervals\nIi\u2212\u01eb := {(min Ii ) \u2212 \u01eb, .+1\n. ., (min Ii ) \u2212 1},\nIi+\u01eb := {(max Ii ) + 1, .+1\n. ., (max Ii ) + \u01eb}.\nThe discrete interval Ii\u2212\u01eb \u222a Ii \u222a Ii+\u01eb is the interval which contains all the classes\nwhere the imaginary agents in the classes of Ii interact with. The next proposition shows that the class(es) in Ii\u2212\u01eb and Ii+\u01eb can only both contain mass or\nboth contain no mass.\nProposition 7. Let p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn be a fixed point of the interactive HK\nMarkov chain (4) with HK transition matrix and let pi > 0 then it holds\npI \u2212\u01eb = 0 \u21d4 pI +\u01eb = 0.\ni\n\ni\n\n14\n\n\fProof. First we consider Ii = {i, i + 1}. Thus, due to Proposition 6 it holds\ni < Mi \u2264 Mi+1 < i + 1. It holds \u2206p = 0 because p is a fixed point. From (10)\nwe can thus derive\npi = (\u2308Mi \u2309 \u2212 Mi )pi + (\u2308Mi+1 \u2309 \u2212 Mi+1 )pi+1\nWith \u2308Mi \u2309 = \u2308Mi+1 \u2309 = i + 1 it follows\npi = ((i + 1) \u2212 Mi )pi + ((i + 1) \u2212 Mi+1 )pi+1 .\nThis can be transformed to\nMi pi + Mi+1 pi+1 = ipi + (i + 1)pi+1\n\n(13)\n\nNow, we assume for an indirect proof that pI \u2212\u01eb = 0 and pI +\u01eb 6= 0 and dei\n\ni\n\nbary\nand\nrive a contradiction. Due to this assumption it holds Mi = M{i,\n+1\n...,i+\u01eb}\nbary\nbary\n< Mi+1 and\nMi+1 = M{i,\n. Then it follows from lemma 5 that M{i,i+1}\n+1\n...,i+1+\u01eb}\nbary\nM{i,i+1}\n\u2264 Mi . Now, we conclude from (13) that\nbary\nbary\nM{i,i+1}\npi + M{i,i+1}\npi+1 < ipi + (i + 1)pi+1 .\n\nBoth sides divided by the positive term (pi + pi+1 ) delivers\nbary\nM{i,i+1}\n<\n\nipi + (i + 1)pi+1\nbary\n= M{i,i+1}\n.\npi + pi+1\n\nA similar contradiction can be derived for the assumption pI \u2212\u01eb 6= 0 and\ni\npI +\u01eb = 0. This proves pI \u2212\u01eb = 0 \u21d4 pI +\u01eb = 0.\ni\ni\ni\nFor Ii = {i \u2212 1, i} arguments are the same after renumbering i \u2192 i \u2212 1.\nFor Ii = {i} it holds Mi = i. Again, we assume for an indirect proof that\npI \u2212\u01eb = 0 and pI +\u01eb > 0 and derive a contradiction:\ni\n\ni\n\nbary\nbary\nMi = M{i,\n< M{i}\n= i = Mi .\n+1\n...,i+\u01eb}\n\nNow, we show that the set of fixed points of the interactive Markov chain\nwith HK transition matrix is the same as for the DW transition matrix.\nTheorem 8. An opinion distribution p \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn is a fixed point of the\ninteractive Markov chain (4) with HK transition matrix and discrete bound of\nconfidence \u01eb \u2208 N if and only if it holds for all k \u2208 n that\npk > 0 \u21d2 pm = 0 for all m \u2208 {k \u2212 \u01eb, . . . , k \u2212 2, k + 2, . . . , k + \u01eb} \u2229 n.\n\n15\n\n(14)\n\n\fProof. For the 'if'-part let us assume that p is a fixed point and show that (14)\nholds. For an indirect proof we assume that there are i, j \u2208 n such that i < j,\n2 \u2264 |i \u2212 j| \u2264 \u01eb and pi , pj > 0 and find a contradiction.\nFrom Proposition 6 we know that Ii and Ij are disjoint. From Proposition\n7 we know that there must exist m0 \u2208 N such that m0 < i, |i \u2212 m0 | \u2264 \u01eb,\npm0 > 0 and Im0 and Ii are disjoint. Comparing m0 and i we know with the\nsame arguments that there must exist m1 \u2208 N with m1 < m0 , |m0 \u2212 m1 | \u2264 \u01eb,\npm1 > 0 and Im1 and Im0 are disjoint. By induction we can construct a sequence\nof natural numbers m0 > m1 > m2 > . . . with pm0 , pm1 , pm2 , * * * > 0. Thus\nthere must exist z \u2208 N such that mz < 1 and pmz > 0, which is a contradiction.\nTo prove the 'only if'-part we assume that for all k \u2208 n it holds (14). We\nhave to check that \u2206pi = 0 in (10) for all i \u2208 n. We see that every addend in\n1\neach equation is of the form pi pj with 2 \u2264 |j \u2212 l| \u2264 \u01eb and i+j\n2 \u2208 {k, k \u00b1 2 }.\nFrom (14) we know that in every case either pi or pj are zero.\nThe convergence to a fixed point remains as a conjecture.\nConjecture. For every p(0) \u2208 \u25b3n\u22121 \u2282 Rn the interactive HK Markov chain\n(p(t))t\u2208N0 converges to a fixed point. Convergence occurs in finite time.\nThere is strong evidence from simulation for the conjecture [19].\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe characterised the set of fixed points for the agent-based DW and HK model.\nThey are identical. We did the same for their corresponding density-based model\nversions (in the approximation of an interactive Markov chain).\nThe proofs were not in every case trivial (especially in the density-based HK\nmodel) although the set of fixed-points is quite plausible on a first view. One\nreason for this is that there can be arbitrary long covergence times in the HK\nmodel (for examples see [19]).\nProofs of convergence for the interactive Markov chains are still lacking,\nalthough there is strong evidence from simulation for convergence to one point in\nthe set of fixed points. Further on, this is an interesting type of set convergence.\nThe processe processes show an interesting type of set-convergence. In contrast\nto many other models these models have a huge amount of fixed points and\nmore over they are not isolated but appear in lines, planes and hyperplanes. On\nthe other hands in contrast to other types of set-convergence the process always\nconverges to one of these fixed points and there are no limit cycles.\nA last question is about a class of models for which one can prove that they\nhave the presented sets of fixed points where both models appear as special\ncases. Here, proofs for both models have been derived seperately, although the\nmodels are similar in spirit.\n\n16\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Robert Axelrod.
