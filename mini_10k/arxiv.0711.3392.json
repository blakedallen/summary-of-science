This method allows us to determine the electronic\nand vibrational symmeties in play, and hence to obtain the so-called propensity rules for the studied\nsystems. We show that only a few scattering states - namely those belonging to the most transmitting eigenchannels - need to be considered for a complete description of the electron transport. We\napply the method on first-principles calculations of four different systems and obtain the propensity\nrules in each case.\n\nElectronic transport through atomic-size junctions is of\nimmense scientific and technological interest. The importance of inelastic effects in electronic currents have been\nrevealed in several ground-breaking experiments leading\nto the detection and identification of single molecules [1],\nchemical reactions [2, 3], the detection of vibrations in\natomic wires [4], the detection of inelastic effects by fluorescence [5], the modification of electron transport in\nnanotubes [6], the molecular motion induced by electronic currents [7], and the hydrogen detection in atomic\nwires [8], just to cite a few examples. Of particular importance due to its spreading use is the case of vibrational spectroscopy where the conductance changes due\nto phonon emission is measured [9, 10, 11]. This is often referred to as point contact spectroscopy or inelastic\nelectron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) [1], However, experiments alone are not able to give direct insight into the\nfundamental question on how the detailed atomic structure correlate with the electrical transport properties.\nThere is experimental evidence of approximate selection\nrules (propensity rules [12]) such that only a small number out of the many possible vibrational modes give an\ninelastic signal. These propensity rules yield clues to the\ngeometric and electronic structure of the junctions. It is\ntherefore of fundamental interest to compare the experimental results with first-principles calculations.\nExisting calculations of inelastic effects in electron\ntransport have been developed either for particular\ncases [12, 13, 14] or for simplified (one-level) models [15, 16]. First-principles methods capable of treating both weak and strong coupling to the electrodes has\nalso been developed [17, 18, 19]. However, the results of\nsuch detailed calculations involve many electronic states\nand vibrational modes. An advanced analysis is therefore\nneeded in order to provide insight into the propensity\nrules.\n\nIn this paper we propose a method for analysis of the\ninelastic transport based on just a few selected electronic\nscattering states, namely those belonging to the most\ntransmitting eigenchannels at the Fermi energy (\u03b5f ) [20].\nThese scattering states typically have the largest amplitude inside the junction and thus account for the majority of the electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. To illustrate\nour method of analysis and to develop an understanding\nof the propensity rules we consider four cases: (i) atomic\ngold-wires, and (ii) molecular junctions, as well as scanning tunneling microscope (STM) setups in the (iii) resonant, and (iv) non-resonant limits. The propensity rules\ncan in these cases be understood from e-ph induced transitions between scattering states of a few eigenchannels.\nInelastic scattering of electrons in a device under bias\ncan be modeled using nonequilibrium Green's functions\n(NEGF) [15, 16, 19]. In particular, the lowest order expansion (LOE) of the NEGF equations provides\na tractable description of phonon scattering in firstprinciples calculations [17]. This approximation assumes\na weak e-ph coupling (M) and that the electronic structure changes slowly over a phonon energy (~\u03c9). It is\ntherefore not applicable to strong e-ph coupling. In the\nzero-temperature limit, the conductance is\nGLOE = G0 \u03c4 +\n\nX\n\ne\u03b3\u03bbLOE \u03b8(|eV | \u2212 ~\u03c9\u03bb ) + G\u03bbAsym , (1)\n\n\u03bb\n\nwhich can be divided into the Landauer term, with the\ntransmission \u03c4 (at \u03b5f ) times the conductance quantum\nG0 , and inelastic corrections in the conductance from\neach vibrational mode. In this formulation we have separated the inelastic contribution in a symmetric term,\nwith respect to bias, from phonon absorption and emission processes, and an asymmetric term G\u03bbAsym . G\u03bbAsym\nis small in the cases studied here since it is (i) strictly\nzero for symmetric junctions and (ii) negligible in the\n\n\f2\nAtomic wires\n\nMolecular wires\n\nreplacements\n\n\u03b1 = \u0393R /\u0393L\n\n1\n\nIncrease\n(peak)\nOff resonance\nOn resonance\n\n0.5\n\nDecrease\n(dip)\n\nSTM\nMax transmission\n\n\u0393L\n\n0\n0\n\n[13, 15, 24]. In the case of low transmission, where only\nthe inelastic term needs to be considered, Troisi et al.\n[12] and Gagliardi et al. [14] have extensively discussed\nthe propensity rules.\nInstead of trying to understand the complex issues of\nthe competition between elastic and inelastic parts of the\nconductance, we have found that the phonon emission\nrate provides a simple way to obtain the IETS propensity\nrules. In the LOE approximation the power deposited\ninto the phonon system is given by [17]\n\n0.5\n\nTransmission \u03c4\n\n\u01eb0\n\nP LOE =\n\n\u0393R\n\nX (~\u03c9\u03bb )2 \b\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: Phase diagram for a one-level model (inset) illustrating the sign of the conductance change at the onset of\nphonon emission.

For these reasons we ignore G\u03bbAsym\nin the following discussion. Each mode thus gives a step\n\u03b8(|eV | \u2212 ~\u03c9\u03bb ) in the conductance at the phonon energy.\nThe magnitude and sign of this step is given by the scattering rate per excess bias\n\b\ne \u0002 \u2020\n\u03b3\u03bbLOE =\nTr G \u0393L G M\u03bb G\u0393R G\u2020 M\u03bb\n\u03c0~\n\u0001 \u0003\ni\n(2)\n+ \u0393R G\u2020 M\u03bb AM\u03bb \u2212 h.c. ,\n2\n\nwhere G is the retarded Green's function at \u03b5f , A =\ni(G \u2212 G\u2020 ) the spectral function, and \u0393L,R the couplings\nto the leads.\nIt is instructive to use a one-level model to get an understanding of the sign of the conductance step. The\none-level model couples a single electronic level to two\nelectronic leads and a localized vibration [17, 21]. A\nphase diagram is plotted in Fig. 1 for the ratio of the\ncoupling to the two leads \u03b1 = \u0393R /\u0393L and the transmission \u03c4 at \u03b5f . For this model the maximal transmission\nis \u03c4max = 4\u03b1/(1 + \u03b1)2 corresponding to the on-resonance\ncase. The crossover from a decrease to an increase in the\nconductance is given by the 1/2 rule [17, 22, 23], i.e., at\n\u03c4crossover = \u03c4max /2. Back-scattering dominates the hightransmission system leading to a decrease of the conductance while forward-scattering leads to an increase in the\nlow-transmitting case [24].\nThe scattering rate \u03b3 LOE may be interpreted as a\ncompetition between an inelastic process, first term of\nEq. (2), that increases the current and an elastic correction, second term of Eq. (2), that decreases the current\n\n(4)\nwhere AL,R = G\u0393L,R G\u2020 are the partial spectral functions from the two leads. To provide physical insights we\nrewrite the trace in terms of a complete set of scattering states |\u03a8l,r i from the left (right) leads. This gives\nEq. (4) in the form of the physically transparent Fermi's\ngolden rule (FGR). It is advantageous to choose the basis\nas eigenchannels [20], i.e., the scattering states belonging\nto the largest transmission. Since the e-ph coupling is essentially local in space, it is sufficient to evaluate Eq. (4)\nusing only a few of the most transmitting eigenchannels\nwhile the reflected scattering states can be ignored. For\nthe examples described below, only one to three scattering states are needed to account for over 90% of the\nphonon scattering.\nTo illustrate how the phonon emission rate leads to the\nIETS propensity rules we have performed calculations\non four experimentally realized systems which we believe\ncorresponds to the four 'corners' of the phase diagram,\nsee Fig. 1 and 2. The calculations were performed within\ndensity functional theory (DFT) [30] using our extension\nof TranSIESTA as described in Ref. [19]. Broadening by\ntemperature and lock-in modulation Vrms were included.\nThe IETS, defined as d2 I/dV 2 /(dI/dV ), is shown\nin Fig. 2 for: (a) Symmetric low-transmission case,\nan oligo-phenyl-ethylene (OPE) molecule symmetrically\nthiol-bonded to the hollow position on Au(111) leads.\nThe temperature and modulation voltage used in the\ncalculation were T = 4.2 K and Vrms = 8 meV. As we\nhave described previously [18], the calculated IETS compare qualitatively with measurements [9].

In case (c) the Fermi energy (\u03b5f ) as\nbeen shifted manually to match the experiment (dashed red\nline). The experimental data originates from Refs. [4, 9, 25,\n26]. For the STM configurations (c) and (d), the calculated\nIETS is compared with a rescaled d2 I/dV 2 .\n\nto Au(100) leads, T = 4.2 K, Vrms = 1 meV. There is\nquantitative agreement with experiments [4, 19]. (c) Onresonance STM configuration with an O2 molecule on\nAg(110) surface displaying a decrease in the conductance\nupon phonon emission [26]. The STM tip is modeled by\na single Ag atom on a Ag(110) lead laterally displaced by\n1.6 \u00c5 corresponding to the experimental situation [26],\nT = 13 K, Vrms = 7 meV. The IETS for O2 /Ag(110) is\nshown both for the self-consistent DFT calculation (solid\nblack) as well as with \u03b5f shifted manually by \u22120.6 eV\nwith respect to the DFT result (dashed red, low bias\nconductance 750 nA/V). (d) Off-resonance STM configuration with a CO molecule adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface [25]. The STM tip is modeled by a single Cu atom\npositioned on a Cu(111) lead, T = 5 K, Vrms = 2 meV.\nWe find that the size of the conductance drop given by\n\u03b3 LOE is well approximated with the phonon emission rate\n\u03b3 FGR . For the OPE and Au-wire cases, the first eigenchannel gives the majority of the phonon emission rate,\nsee Fig. 3. In this case the propensity rules follows from\nthe symmetry of the scattering states which are similar\nto the Bloch states of the corresponding periodic systems\n[20]. To illustrate this understanding of the IETS we have\npublished Mathematica notebooks showing the propensity rules for tight-binding models [21]. Before comparing\nthe theoretical STM-IETS to the experimental, we note\nthat the typical tip-sample distances of STM are much\nlarger than what is feasible computationally with a localized basis set. In practice, we work with a significantly\nsmaller tip-sample distances than in the experimental sit-\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n-1\n\n\u2206\u03b5f = \u22120.6 eV\n\nBias (mV)\n\nIETS\n|\u03b3LOE |\n|\u03b3FGR |\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n-40 -20\n\n(a) OPE/Au\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n(b) Au-wire\n\n10\n\n`\n \u0301\n\u2212\u03b3 1012 /(sV )\n\nreplacements\n\n(b) Au-wire\n\n(a) OPE/Au\nTheory\nExp.\n\nd2 I/dV 2 /(dI/dV ) (1/V )\n\nd2 I/dV 2 /(dI/dV ) (1/V )\n\n4\n\n`\n \u0301\n\u03b3 1011 /(sV )\n\n3\n\n20\n\nBias, ~\u03c9 (meV)\nFIG. 3: Comparison between the FGR scattering rate, calculated using only the single-most transmitting eigenchannel,\nwith the full LOE rate for (a) OPE molecule with Au(111)\nleads (zero-bias conductance of 1.0 \u00d7 1013 /(sV)), and (b) 7atom Au wire (4.8 \u00d7 1014 /(sV)). The sign of the FGR rate\nwas chosen to agree with the LOE rate.\n\nuation, while still being in the tunneling regime.\nResults for the O2 on Ag(110) system is shown in\nFig. 2(c). In this case our first-principles calculation fails\nto describe the conductance decreases observed experimentally [30]. The DFT-based energy spectrum does not\nhave a molecular resonance at \u03b5f , c.f., the on-resonance\ncase of Fig. 1. However, DFT predicts a \u03c0* resonance\n0.6 eV below \u03b5f [27]. By manually adjusting \u03b5f to this\nresonance we manage to capture some of the qualitative\nfeatures of the IETS. Although this result is suggestive,\nwe have no conclusive evidence that the experimental decrease is caused by this mechanism.\nThe results for CO/Cu(111) [30] is shown in Fig. 2(d)\nand Fig. 4. The height of the IETS peaks are qualitatively captured, we predict that 13 % of the transmitted electrons will emit a frustrated rotation phonon\ncompared to 8% found experimentally for CO/Cu(001)\n[28, 29]. The eigenchannels necessary to calculate the\ntransition rates \u03b3 FGR are shown in Fig. 4(a). We note\nthat the primary eigenchannel is of \u03c3-type, i.e., rotationally symmetric around the tip-molecule direction, while\nthe secondary and tertiary are of \u03c0-type. Comparing\nthe scattering states to the phonon modes, Fig. 4(b),\nthe propensity rules naturally follows from the symmetry.\nThe frustrated translation (FTx,y ) and frustrated rotation (FRx,y ) modes (in the surface xy-plane) can only\nscatter between a \u03c0- and a \u03c3-type eigenchannel, because\nthe modes have \u03c0-character with respect to the transport direction, i.e., s2 \u2194 t1 and s3 \u2194 t1. Note that\nthe s1 \u2194 t2, 3 transitions are less important due to the\nweight of the scattering states (Fig. 4). Similarly, the\n\u03c3-type FTz and CO stretch modes only scatter between\neigenchannels of the same type, e.g., s1 \u2194 t1.

The FGR rate Eq. (4) (using all eigenchannels) and the LOE rate Eq. (1) are given in units of\n1010 (sV )\u22121 (elastic transmission = 130 \u00d7 1010 (sV )\u22121 ). The\ndominating transitions between the eigenchannel scattering\nstates are indicated along with the fraction in which these\nprocesses contribute to the total FGR rate.\n\nconfirms these observations and gives a quantitative account of the e-ph scattering in the CO/Cu(111) system.\nIt shows that \u03b3 FGR closely approximates the \u03b3 LOE and\nthat the main part is given by the first three eigenchannels.\nWe have presented a method to analyze inelastic e-\n\nph scattering in terms of eigenchannel scattering states.\nThe main advance in the context of first-principles transport calculations is to bring the description into a natural\nframework where underlying symmetries of the propensity rules can be understood. Through four different examples corresponding to different transport regimes, we\ndemonstrated that the eigenchannel analysis addresses\nthe propensity rules in a unified way.\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: magnus.paulsson@hik.se\n[1] B.
