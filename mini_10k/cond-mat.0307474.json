Last two\ndecades, atomic scale friction has been attracted much attention for the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of\nmacroscopic friction and for many fields of high precision\nengineering such as nanomachine[1]. Frictional force microscope (FFM) has played an important role in study of\natomic scale friction[1, 2]. Behavior of frictional force in\nFFM experiments has been studied theoretically and numerically based on the model which consists of a single atom tip\nand the potential by a substrate surface[3, 4, 5, 6, 8]. The\nmagnitude of load in FFM experiments in layered materials, however, is much higher than that estimated numerically\nand theoretically[2, 7]. Some groups pointed out that a flake\ncleaved from the substrate plays a crucial role in FFM experiments in such systems[2, 4, 9, 10, 11]. It is not appropriate\nto discuss frictional phenomena with a flake by using the single atom tip model. We investigate in this letter atomic scale\nfriction between clean graphite surfaces by molecular dynamics (MD). The model employed here simulates friction in the\nFFM experiments on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate with a flake. The present work enables us to understand\nresults of the FFM experiments more deeply. Graphite is one\nof the most important solid lubricants. It turns out that the\nmicroscopic origin of lubrication property of graphite lies on\nthe honeycomb structure in each layer, not only on the weak\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kmatsu@issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\naddress: hm@phys.aoyama.ac.jp\n\u2021 Electronic address: naru@cello.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nFIG. 1: (a)The schematic illustration of the model and (b) the flake\nand the substrate in the present study.

Atoms in the flake obey the following\neqs. of motion,\n\u03b1\nmC \u1e8d\u03b1\ni = \u2212\u03b3 \u1e8bi \u2212\n\n\u2202VSub\n\u2202VI\nk\u03b1 \u03b1\n\u2212 \u03b1\u2212\n(x \u2212 x\u03b1\nB) .\n\u03b1\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi\nNf C\n\n(1)\n\nHere mC is the mass of the carbon atom, x\u03b1\ni , \u03b1 = x, y, z, are\ncomponents of the i-th atom position vector and a dot above\nx\u03b1\ni denotes the time derivative. The x and y-directions are\nshown in fig. 1(b) and the z-direction is normal to the surface\nplane of the substrate. Atoms in the substrate are fixed because their deformations are negligibly small in the present\nparameter range. The first term in the r. h. s. of eq. (1) is a\ndamping term proportional to the velocity, which reproduces\nthe energy dissipation to the substrate. We set a damping constant \u03b3 = 1.14 \u00d7 10\u22124 nNs/m.

The second term denotes the force coming from interatomic interactions between the flake and the\nsubstrate. VSub denotes the sum of pair atomic interaction potential between an atom in the flake and that in the substrate.\nWe employ the Lennard-Jones (12, 6) potential with a cut off\nlength R, outside of which the interatomic potential is negligible. We set Lennard-Jones parameters and the cut-off length\nas \u03b5 = 0.965 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV, \u03c3 = 0.340 nm and R = 2.0 nm.\nThe above values of \u03b5 and \u03c3 are often employed in the interlayer atomic potential in bulk graphite [12]. The third term\ndenotes the force by the intraflake atomic interactions. We\nemploy linear spring potentials for the bond length and the\nangle between bonds of nearest neighbor carbon atoms and\nz-displacement of an atom against nearest atoms. They are\nemployed in the study of lattice vibrations and specific heat of\ngraphite [13] and FFM images [5, 6]. The fourth term denotes\nthe force by the driving spring with the components of spring\nconstants, k\u03b1 , \u03b1 = x, y, z. The spring corresponds to a tip\n\u03b1\nand a cantilever in FFM. Nf , x\u03b1\nC and xB denote the number of\ncarbon atoms in the flake, \u03b1-components of a center position\nof the flake mass and a base position of the driving spring,\nrespectively. Here we set kx = ky = 1.5 eV/nm2 , kz = 5.0\neV/nm2 . Flake size is not known experimentally. The sizes of\nthe flake Nf in the present calculation are 6, 20, 42 and 110.\nThe results shown below are those for Nf = 110[14]. The\nshape of the flake is shown in fig. 1(b).

L and (VSx , VSy ) denote the loading force and the lateral\ndriving velocity, respectively. The values of these parameters\nare kept constant during driving.\nEquations of motion, (1) and (2) are solved numerically by\nusing the Runge-Kutta method. In the initial state the system\nis stable with the applied loading force L and no lateral expansions of the driving spring. The configuration corresponds\nto the AB stacking structure of bulk graphite as shown in\nfig. 1(b). The frictional force is defined as a driving direction\n\u03b1\ncomponent of the force of the driving spring, k\u03b1 (x\u03b1\nB \u2212 xC ).\nIt is to be noted that deformations of the flake are negligibly small in the present calculation. This is because that the\ninterlayer atomic interactions between the flake and the substrate under load are much weaker than the intralayer atomic\ninteractions in the flake. It is also to be noted that the rota~ C in the x-y plane is inhibited due to\ntion of the flake around x\nthe potential barrier against it. Due to these two features the\n~ C , governs the dydynamics of the center of the flake mass, x\nnamics of the system. At first we focus on the typical motions\n~ C . Figure 2 shows the driving direction component of the\nof x\ncenter of the flake mass, xC , as a function of that of the base\nposition of the driving spring, xB , for L = 100 nN, VS = 0.22\nm/s in the case driven along the x (a) and y (b) directions, re~ C are observed.

The unit of numbers on heavy dotted equipotential lines is\neV. The inset shows the configuration of the flake and the substrate\nwhich makes the AB stacking structure of bulk graphite.

The slips of x\npositions close to the substrate potential minimum, in which\nthe flake makes the AB stacking structure of the graphite, as\nshown in the inset of fig. 3. The atomic scale stick-slip motion\nresults from the binding of the flake close to the AB stacking\npositions of the graphite flake on the graphite substrate.\nFigure 4 shows the frictional force F as a function of xB\nfor VS = 0.22 m/s driven along the x (a) and y (b) directions,\nrespectively. F initially increases linearly with xB due to the\nelastic deformation of the driving spring. After F takes the\nmaximum value the curves exhibit periodic saw-tooth shapes,\nwhich are observed in experiments [2, 4, 15, 16], due to the\nperiodic stick-slip motions of the flake. The regions A, D and\nG as shown in the insets in fig. 4 (a,b) correspond to sticking\nstates around those in fig. 3, respectively.\nWe define the maximum static frictional force Fs and the\nkinetic frictional force Fk as the maximum frictional force\nduring driving and a time averaged value of the frictional force\nduring one cycle of the stick-slip motion, respectively. Figure 5 shows Fs and Fk as a function of the loading force, L,\ndriven along the x and y-directions. The dependence of Fs\nand Fk on VS is weak. This is because that even in the present\ncalculation the time scale of the driving is much longer than\n\nthat of atomic one. The values of the frictional force in fig. 5\nare obtained by extrapolating data for VS = 0.22, 0.44 and\n0.88 m/s to VS = 0 m/s for the comparison with experiments,\nin which the typical magnitude of VS is about 40 nm/s. Fs\nand Fk linearly depend on the loading force and have a finite\nadhesive term a, which is the frictional force at L = 0 nN.\nThe frictional coefficient \u03bc is defined as,\nF\u0303 = \u03bcL + a.\n\n(3)\n\nHere F\u0303 denotes Fs or Fk . The magnitude of the frictional\nforce in the range of the loading force in fig. 5 is very low\nwith the frictional coefficients \u03bcs = \u03bck = 0.013 driven along\nthe x-direction and \u03bcs = \u03bck = 0.0055 driven along the ydirections. Here \u03bcs and \u03bck denote the frictional coefficients\nof Fs and Fk , respectively. These values are close to those\nobserved in the experiment, \u03bc = 0.012 [2].\nHere we discuss the mechanism of the low frictional coefficients of graphite. It has been believed that the low frictional coefficient of macroscopic graphite surfaces or graphite\nsolid lubricants results from the weak interlayer interaction.\nWe obtain, however, the frictional coefficient \u03bc = 0.099 for\na single carbon atom tip on the graphite substrate for the\nsame pressure value with the case of the flake, which is much\nlarger than those in our simulation of the flake and that in the\nexperiment[2]. The difference of the frictional coefficients indicates an another mechanism of the low frictional coefficients\nbetween graphite surfaces. In the flake there are two kinds of\nlattice sites \u00c2 and B\u0302 catching different forces from the substrate as shown in fig. 6. The substrate potential for the flake\nVsub is the sum of the substrate potential for a single atom at\n\u00c2\nB\u0302\nthe sites \u00c2, Vsub\n, and that at the sites B\u0302, Vsub\n. That is, Vsub =\n\u00c2\nB\u0302\nN\u00c2 Vsub + NB\u0302 Vsub , where N\u00c2 and NB\u0302 denote the number of\nthe sites \u00c2 and B\u0302. In the flake N\u00c2 = NB\u0302 . Here we consider\n~ C moves straight between the nearest substrate\nthe case that x\npotential minimums A and C shown in fig. 3. The atoms at\nsites \u00c2 move from the potential minimum to the maximum\nand those at sites B\u0302 move from the maximum to the minimum\n1.5\n\nFk\nFs\nFk\nFs\n\n1.0\n\nx\nx\ny\ny\n\nF[nN]\n\n\u0083\u00ca=0.013\n\n0.5\n\n\u0083\u00ca=0.0055\n0.0\n0\n\nFIG. 4: The frictional force F as a function of xB for VS = 0.22 m/s\nand L = 1, 10, 50 and 100 nN and in the case driven along the (a) x\nand (b) y-directions.\n\n50\nL [nN]\n\n100\n\nFIG. 5: Fk and Fs , as a function of the loading force. x and y\nindicate the direction of the driving.\n\n\f4\n^\nB\n\n^\nA\n\n^\n\n^\nA\n\n^\n\n^\nA\n\nB\nB\n\n^\nB\n\n^B\n\n^\nA\n\n^\nB\n\n^A\n\n^\nA\n\nA\n\npotential for the flake Vsub does not vary in the route between\nthe nearest potential minimums. As a result the flat potential\nvalleys appears for the flake in the shaded region shown in\nfig. 3. The valleys enable the flake to move easily and yield\nlow frictional force. Due to this mechanism graphite becomes\na good lubricant with low frictional coefficient. On the other\nhand the single carbon atom above the graphite substrate has\nlarge frictional coefficient because of the absence of such cancellation mechanism of the substrate potential.\n\n^\nB\n\n^\nA\n\ny\n\n \u0308a\u0081 \u0081\nx\n\nC\n\nFIG. 6: The stacking structure of a flake on a substrate.

When the flake is large enough that the interaction beof x\ntween the flake and the substrate is so strong as to overcome\nthe stiffness of the driving spring, the dominant contribution\nto the acceleration of the flake is flake size independent value,\n\u00c2\nB\u0302\n(\u2202A Vsub\n+ \u2202B\u0302 Vsub\n)/2mC , for the same separation between\nthe flake and the substrate. Here \u2202\u00c2,B\u0302 denote the coordinate\nderivatives at the sites \u00c2 and B\u0302, respectively. Then because\nthe trajectory is independent of the flake size, the frictional\ncoefficient is also independent of the flake size. The flake in\nthis simulation is sufficiently large, so that the frictional coefficient is independent of the flake size. In fact the difference between the frictional coefficients for Nf = 42 and 110\nis much small as about 2 %.\n\nFIG. 7: The substrate potential during the motion of the flake A \u2192 C\nshown in fig. 3.

The former is due to\nthe binding of the flake close to the stacking configurations on\nthe substrate. The latter results from the cancellation of the\nforces coming from the substrate between two kinds of lattice\nsites in the flake, which is discovered in this letter for the first\ntime within our knowledge.\n\n\u00c2\nas shown in fig. 7.
