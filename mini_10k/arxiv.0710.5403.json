We can however construct the energy landscape only for systems\nof small size, because in general the phase-space volume grows exponentially as the system's\ndegrees of freedom increase. To tackle the restriction regarding the size of the phase space,\nwe can sustain the key information of the landscape, such as the energy minima (inherent\nstructure) and transition states between minima, and encode them into two kind of complex\nnetworks[11] that are known as connectivity and disconnectivity graphs. In a connectivity\nnetwork, each node represents a local minimum energy of the system while the links are\ntransition pathways connecting two neighboring minima. In a disconnectivity network, each\nnode represents a super basin with an energy of E. The super basin of energy E consists of\nat least two smaller super basins, which are separated by an energy barrier of the absolute\nheight E. In this way we can construct a hierarchical tree in which each super basin is\nconnected to its subset super basins. In such a tree, the root is the largest super basin that\nincludes all the states, and leafs are the local energy minima. The disconnectivity graph\nwas first introduced by Becker and Karplus to study peptide structure and kinetics[12].\nComplex networks have been frequently employed to analyze the energy landscapes of\ndifferent physical systems[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. This method also has been utilized in the\nconsideration of the energy landscape of the system of Lenard-Jones particles[13], the protein\nchains[18, 19] or spin-glasses[20].\nNetworks are usually categorized in terms of their degree distribution, i.e. the distribution of the number of links at each node in the network. A well studied kind of network in the literature is the scale-free network which has a power-law form for the degree\ndistribution[21]. The scale-free behavior has been observed in various systems such as friendship, the Internet[11]. The same also has been reported by Doye in the energy landscape of\na cluster of Lenard-Jones particles[13], in short peptide chains by Rao and Caflisch[18] and\nGfeller et all [19]. Burda et al also reported a power-law tail only for a spin-glass model embedded in a random graph[9], in other cases they showed that a one-dimensional spin-glass\nexhibits a normal or log-normal distribution of nodes' degree. It is still unclear if frustrated\nsystems with a very rough energy landscape are also a scale-free.\n3\n\n\f\u22122\n\u22124\n\u22126\n\u221210\n\n\u22128\n\nln [ P(E min )]\n\nenumeration\ntheory\n\n\u22120.9 \u22120.8 \u22120.7 \u22120.6 \u22120.5 \u22120.4 \u22120.3\n\nEmin /N\nFIG. 1: Comparison of the theoretical (line) and enumeration (disks) results. The line represents\nthe Eq. (4). The system size here is 27 spins and the PDF is averaged over 150 realizations.\n\nSpin-glasses in general are good prototype models to examine the rough energy landscape\nof frustrated systems. They represent a broad class of the complex systems. Many interesting problems are indeed analogous to spin-glasses, examples are the three satisfiability\nproblem[22] or the protein folding[23]. Setting aside the advantage of the Derrida's random\nenergy model (REM)[24] which simplifies the analytical studies of the spin-glass systems\nand, in part, defeat the purpose of such studies.\nThis article is organized in the following order: In Sec. II, we obtain an analytical estimate\nof the probability density of energy minima and degrees of nodes. In Sec. III, we state the\nenumeration method which includes helical boundary condition, multiple spins method with\nthe help of bit-wise operations (the most basic operators on a computer, e.g., AND and\nXOR) and a painting algorithm to label minima and their surrounding basins. Afterwards,\nin Sec. IV we discuss the enumeration results, and finally, we compare our results with\nother energy landscape networks and discuss the most relevant sources of differences, i.e.,\nthe presence of frustration and the energy density function. The concluding remarks are\npresented in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nMEAN FIELD CALCULATION\n\nWe consider a random Ising model on a 2D square lattice of N sites. We present the\nspin in the ith site by si . Every spin is either up (+1) or down (-1). We represent each\n\n4\n\n\fconfiguration of the system with a vector of spins denoted by s = (s0 , s1 , s2 , ..., si , ..., sN \u22121 ).\nThe phase-space thus consists of 2N such vectors.\nWe define a hamming distance between two configurations of the system in the phase\nspace, s and s\u2032 , as the number of their mismatched elements\n\nP\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4si ,s\u2032i ). If the distance\n\nbetween two configurations is one \u2013meaning that they differ only in one spin\u2013 we call them\nadjacent neighbors.\nWe will consider a spin-glass-dynamics such that spins interact only with their adjacent\nneighbors. So, each spin interacts with 4 of its neighbors. We consider further that the\ncoupling constant of the interactions, Jij , is either +J or \u2212J. Then the Hamiltonian follows\nH=\n\n1 X\nJij si sj ,\n2 <ij>\n\n(1)\n\nwhere summation is over the adjacent neighbors. We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as H =\nJ(n+ \u2212 n\u2212 ) where n\u2212 is the number of satisfied interactions while n+ is the number of\nfrustrated interactions. The sum of these two numbers is n+ + n\u2212 = 2N.\n\nRandom energy model[24] assumes that the energy density function is Gaussian.\nP (E) = (N\u03c0J 2 )\u22121/2 exp(\u2212E 2 /NJ 2 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwherein the energy of randomly chosen state of s is E.\nTo begin with, we would like to calculate the probability that a given configuration s is a\nlocal minimum. For doing so, we first review the properties of local minima. The energy of a\nlocal minimum by definition is lower than the energy of its neighbors. It's energy, therefore,\nincreases when we flip any of its spins. As a result, for a local minimum configuration, just\none of the four interactions of any site can be frustrated. In other words, there must not\nexist any frustrated pairs of interactions sharing one end (spin). Consequently, the odds for\na configuration to be a local minimum is the same as of a configuration wherein all frustrated\ninteractions are distinct (isolated from each other).\nThe probability to have a frustrated interaction surrounded by satisfied interactions is\nn\u2212\n\n( 2N )6 , where n\u2212 is the total number of satisfied interactions. The exponent of six is due\nto the number of the interactions which are connected to the frustrated interaction. Since\nwe have n+ unsatisfied (frustrated) interactions, the probability of having all the unsatisfied\n\u2212\n\n+\n\nn\n)6n . But here we have over counted some of the satisfied interacinteractions isolated is ( 2N\n\ntions. The over counting happens when a satisfied interaction has two frustrated interactions\n5\n\n\f+\n\nat its ends. Such cases approximately occur n\u2212 ( 3n\n)2 times; therefore, the final probability\n2N\n\u2212\n\nn\n)6n\nof having a local minimum with energy E is \u2248 ( 2N\n\nand\n\nE\nJ\n\n+\n+ \u2212n\u2212 9 ( n )2\n4 N\n\n. Recalling 2N = n+ + n\u2212\n\n= n+ \u2212 n\u2212 , we restate the probability in terms of E and N. This leads to\n\u0012\n\n1\nE\n\u2212\n2 4NJ\n\n3\n\u0013 32\n(4+E/N J)(10+(E/N J)2 )\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is the probability distribution function (PDF) of energy minima to be derived from:\n2\n\u00133\n\u0012\n2\n1\nE 32 (4+E/N J)(10+(E/N J) )\n1\n\u2212 E2\nNJ\n.\n(4)\nP (E) = \u221a\n\u2212\ne\n2 4NJ\nN\u03c0J 2\nHaving obtained the PDF of energy minima, it is easy to estimate the degree distribution.\n\nEach minimum is down in a basin. The volume of a basin is proportional to e\u2212E/J . The\nnumber of neighbors of a basin is proportional to its volume. Therefore, we can say that\nln k \u223c \u2212 EJ where k is the degree of the node. Thus, the probability distribution of the\ndegrees is approximated by:\n\n\u2212\n\nP (k) \u223c e\n\n1 ln(k)\n+\n2\n4N\n\nln(k)2\n\u2212ln(k)\nN\n\n!\n\n3\n(4\u2212ln(k)/N )\n32\n\n(10+ln(k)2 /N 2 )\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWe shall shortly see that Eq. (5) leads to a good approximation for the distribution. In\norder to further clarify the Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) we show that within some approximations\nthey reduce to familiar expressions. For small values of\n\u0012\n\nE\n1\n\u2212\n2 4NJ\n\n3\n\u0013 32\n(4+E/N J)(10+(E/N J)2 )\n\nE\nNJ\n\nwe can approximately write\n15\n\n15E\n\n\u2248 2\u2212 4 e\u2212 16NJ ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhose insertion into Eq.

We achieve this goal by first sweeping the energy landscape.\n6\n\n\f1 2\n4 5\n7 1\n4\n7\n\n1\n4\n7\n3\n6\n2\n5\n\n2\n5\n1\n4\n7\n3\n6\n\n3\n6\n2\n5\n1\n4\n7\n\n1\n4\n7\n3\n6\n2\n5\n\n2\n5\n1\n4\n7\n3\n6\n\n3\n6\n2 3\n5 6\n\nFIG. 2: Illustrating the helical boundary condition. The lattice has 7 sites, 2 sites less than a\ncomplete square 9. Nevertheless, the plane is covered by lattices consistently.\n\nWe generate all of 2N configurations before calculating the energy of each configuration.\nHaving computed the energy of all configurations, we then find the local minima with the\nhelp of a painting algorithm. Afterwards, we construct the adjacent network of the local\nminima. By employing the multiple spins method, we save CPU time and memory. This\nenables us to sweep the phase-space corresponding to systems of up to 27 spins, with an\nordinary PC (about 3GHz and 2GB). We utilize the helical boundary conditions to take\nadvantage of the periodic boundary conditions, and furthermore, to be able to study any\nnumber of spins, even though it is not a complete square[25].\nHelical boundary condition resembles the periodic boundary condition but sets the last\nspin of a row to be the neighbor of the first spin of the next row (FIG. 2). Helical boundary\ncondition, avoiding the constraint of the square number of the lattice sites, allows for an\narbitrary number of spins, including the integer numbers which are not a complete square.\nIn the multiple spins method, each spin is represented by one single low-level bit of\nthe computer memory: either 0, or 1. Therefore, a lattice configuration represented by\ns = (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) becomes a binary number 1001010, which is u = 74 in the decimal\nbase.\nWe can also treat the coupling constants in the same way. The only difference is that the\n\n7\n\n\fnumber of interactions are twice the number of spins.\nNow we can use bit-wise operations, exclusive or (xor) and bit rotation, to calculate\nenergy of a given state. First we calculate (u \u2295 R(u, 1)) \u2295 j , where \u2295 is xor operator and\nR(u, n) rotates u by n bits. We count the number of ones in the binary form of the results\nwhich gives us the energy of the horizontal interactions. In the same way, we calculate the\nenergy of vertical interactions. This time we have to rotate bits by the number of columns\nof the lattice nc , (u \u2295 R(u, nc )) \u2295 j| . Again, we count the number of ones in the binary form\nof the result. The sum of these two counts gives us the total energy.\nSince it is not very straightforward to deal with degenerate ground states in the painting algorithm, we used uniformly distributed coupling constants between \u00b11, to overcome\ndegeneracy[31].\nHaving the energy landscape, we use a painting algorithm to find minima. First we sort\nthe energies from low to high. We start from the bottom of the list and paint the first\nelement with a color. Then, we look at the next lowest energy state. If this state is a\nneighbor of the former state (It is different in only one spin), we paint it with the same\ncolor. If it is not a neighbor of any painted state, we associate a new color to that. As we go\nup the list, if we meet a state none of whose neighbors were painted before, it is a minimum.\nBut if it has painted neighbors, then we paint it with the same color so it will belong to\nthe same basin. In the case it has some neighbors which have been already painted with\ndifferent colors, this indicates a border. In this method, members of any basin are painted\nwith the same color and the border of colors show the transit states.\nBasins are characterized by the minimum energy, their size and their depth. We already\nknow the minimum energy of the basins. The size of a basin is the number of states which\nbelongs to that basin (The number of states with the same color). Defining the depth of a\nbasin is more tricky. Each basin has a border where the states over it might not have equal\nenergies. Therefore, knowing all of the states on the border, we have three choices to use in\ndefining the depth of a basin: the average energy on the border, the highest energy barrier\nand the lowest energy barrier. Subtracting the minimum energy from these values gives us\nmean depth, highest depth and the lowest depth, respectively.\nThe connectivity graph does not give us any information about the energy barriers; therefore, we use the information of energy barriers to construct the disconnectivity graph[12].\nThe disconnectivity graph is generated in the following way. Imagine that the energy land8\n\n\fscape is a real landscape consisting of mountains and valleys. Below this landscape, there is\nan underground sea. We start increasing the level of underground water. When the water\nlevel reaches to the deepest part of the landscape, a lake start to form. As we increase the\nlevel of underground water, more lakes (super basins) appear, and some times, lakes merge\nand give rise to larger lakes. Now in our graph, each node coresponds to a lake (super basin),\nand the links connect each lake to its ancestors \u2013lakes that created it by merging. In a given\nwater level a new lake can appear or a lake can shape from merging of other lakes; therefore,\nwe associate a water level (energy) to each node. It shows the water level (energy) in which\nthe lake (super basin) is created.\nSpin glasses are well known for frustration, so one can ask if frustration has any impact on\nthe network topology. We investigate this question by using coupling constants distributed\nbetween a \u2212 1 and a + 1 where a is constant. Here a = 0 means our frustrated spin glass\nmodel and a = \u22121 represents a ferromagnetic Ising model. Therefore, the parameter a\ncontrols the amount of frustration. We shall show that altering a changes the shape of the\ndegree distribution.\nWe are also interested in various statistical properties akin to that of the degree distribution of the underlying graphs, the histograms of minimum energies, basin sizes and depths.\nTo have good statistics for these PDFs , we ran the enumeration for different realizations of\nquenched random coupling constant and then we averaged the results. Our results will be\ndemonstrated in the next section.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nLooking at the probability density function of the energy of local minima (FIG. 1), shows\nthat it has a distorted Gaussian shape that follows Eq. (4). Such a PDF of minima is also\nseen in the case of LJ clusters[26, 27, 28].\nMoreover, we investigate a relation between degrees of basins and their minimum energy\n(FIG. 3). As one can see ln k \u223c \u2212 EJ relates the degree to energy. This is expected according\nto the argument in the analytical section of this article. But for minima with energies close\nto the global minimum, this relation does not hold any more. This might be due to the\nfinite size effect, as it is more visible in the smaller systems.\nHistogram of the numbers of the neighbors of a basin is the next quantity to study\n9\n\n\f16\n20\n27\n\nk\n\n100\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\nEmin /N\nFIG. 3: Degrees vs Energy of minima.

Histograms of minimum depths have\nalso an exponential PDF (FIG. 7) indicating many shallow basins (short energy barriers)\nbut very few deep basins (tall energy barriers).\n10\n\n\f0.1\n10\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\nPk\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n[-2,0]\n[-1,1]\n\n1\n\n10\n\nk\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 5: Frustration affects the probability density functions of degrees in the energy landscape\nnetworks. The results are for a 25-spin system. Disks shows the PDF for a model without frustration and triangles present PDF of the frustrated spin-glass model. The solid line has a slope of\n\u22123.46. This result suggest that absence of frustration may lead to something close to a power-law\ntail.\n\nWe obtained a log-Weibull behavior for the distribution of degrees for our spin system\n(FIG. 4) and a normal distribution for energy of minima (FIG. 1).The PDF of minimum\nenergies is scaled with the number of spins. For all system sizes, we have a peak at about\n0.5 J. Thus, for any system size, the distribution peak is considerably far from origin.\nAssuming that k \u223c e\u2212Emin , a log-normal behavior is expected for the PDF of degrees. This\nis in consonant with FIG. 3 of reference [16], for short chains of random polymers and with\nFIG. 9 of reference [9]. There are also contrasting reports of scale-free behavior for the\ntopology of the energy landscape in some other systems[13, 18].\nIt is important to know why there is such a difference. We note that these two systems\n\u2013spin-glass and LJ clusters\u2013 are both NP problems from the computational complexity point\nof view and at the same time, they are two standard models to study complex systems.\nThere are three main reasons for having different results for spin-glasses on one hand and\nfor proteins and cluster of LJ particle on the other hand: a spin-glass is a frustrated system\nwhereas the others are not. The energy density of different systems might be different from\nspin-glass and their data are to be interpreted in a different way.\nIn order to remove frustration from our model, it is enough to use a set of random coupling\nconstant J \u2208 [\u22122, 0]. This is the minimal change to our model that abolishes frustration,\nwhile keeping the quenched randomness. The PDF of degree distribution of representing\n11\n\n\fE=\u22129.70\n\nE=\u221218.49\n\nE=\u221221.58\n\nE=\u221239.89\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) The disconnectivity graph of frustrated spin-glass is on the left and the\none of unfrustrated spin-glass is on the right. The vertical direction represents the energy of the\nsuper basins, in a way that higher nodes have larger energies. The highest and the lowest energies\nare annotated. For a better understanding, we also showed the energies in colors: red shows the\nlowest energy and blue represents the highest energy. Here, the system size is 25 spins, and the\ncoupling constant of the unfrustrated spin-glass is produced by shifting the coupling constants of\nthe frustrated model by +1.\n\nenergy landscape network of this modified system is shown in FIG. 5. One can see that\nthis log-log plot of the PDF become similar to y = y0 \u2212 b|x \u2212 x0 |, in which the slope of\nthe power-law tail is \u22123.46. We already know that log-log plot of the same PDF for the\ncase of frustrated spin-glass is close to a parabola. Interestingly, the PDF in the absence\nof frustration is very similar to the case of proteins[18]. In addition to the PDF of the\nconnectivity graph, we can look at the disconnectivity graph to compare the frustrated and\nnone-frustrated models. In FIG. 6 one can see the disconnectivity graphs of a frustrated and\nunfrustrated system of 25 spins. The graph of frustrated system has more branches, which\nmeans the related landscape is rougher.\nReminding the mean field results, the log-Weibull shape of the histograms of the degrees\nis closely related to the Gaussian behavior of PDF of the energy minima. As it is shown in\nFIG. 3, the absolute value of minimum energy of a basin is proportional to the logarithm\nof the number of its neighboring basins. Then correlation between PDFs of degrees and\nminimum energies is a consequence of this logarithmic relation. Thus a power law distribution for degrees[13] is the result of an exponential distribution of energy minima. But\nthis possibility is ruled out because also in LJ clusters, energy minima follows a Gaussian\ndistribution[26, 30].\nAnother reason of the unlikeliness refers to different ways of interpreting the results.\n12\n\n\f0.5\n0.0005 0.005 0.05\n\nPDF of minimum depth\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nMinimum of depth\nFIG. 7: In this figure the PDF of minimum depths is demonstrated. Minimum depth is the\ndifference between the minimum energy of a basin and the lowest energy on the border of that\nbasin. It has an exponential distribution.\n\nUsually we have few samples to calculate the probability density function directly. One way\nto overcome this problem is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) instead of\nthe PDF, which gives us a plot with less noises. On the other hand, when we have data\nspanning only over a few orders of magnitude, by looking at the cumulative distributions,\nwe can hardly distinguish between log-normal, log-Weibull and power-law distributions.\nUsing a spin glass model, we have the ability to run the enumeration on different quenched\ncoupling constants which provides us with a rich statistics. Therefore, we can look at\nthe average distribution over many realizations of the system instead of their cumulative\ndistributions to dominate the noises. In this way, it is much easier to distinguish between\nthese two types of the functions of power-law or log-Weibull. Our results are averaged over\n150 realizations of 27-spin system and 750 when we had 25 spins.\nOne of our findings is the different behaviors of the minimum energies on the one hand\nand the minimum depth of the related basins on the other hand. As we mentioned before,\nminimum energies follow almost a Gaussian distribution whereas the minimum depths of\nthe related basins follow an exponentially decaying distribution (FIG. 7). This fact suggests\nthat we face a rough landscape. It means that we cannot define a large and smooth basin\nfor the minima. Indeed, they have a rough basin that is full of many shallow basins. Any\nof these small basins is asymmetric in a way that the difference between its minimum depth\nand maximum depth is considerable. This is in agreement with our general perspective of\n13\n\n\f0.0001\n\n0.01\n\nP(\u2206Esb)\n\n1\n\nfrustrated\nunfrustrated\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206 E sb\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 8: This figure shows the PDF of \u2206Esb which is the absolute value of the difference in the\nenergy of two connected nodes in the disconnectivity graph.

The same conclusion is reached via disconnectivity graphs FIG. 6 and\nFIG. 8.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this work we have shown that in the case of spin-glasses, the distribution of the energy\nminima is Gaussian and the associated network to the energy landscape has a log-Weibull\ndegree distribution. This is verified by both numerical and analytical results. The result\nis in contrast with the case of the Lennard-Jones clusters which has a scale-free topology.\nThis shows that the graph topology of an energy landscape is not universal and is highly\nrelated to physical properties of the model system. Our results show that the energy density\nfunction and frustration which are the most distinct differences between the two systems of\nspin-glasses and Lennard-Jones clusters are the most important factors.\nFrustration alters the probability density function of degrees in energy landscape network and changes the shape of the density function. In the absence of frustration, the\nprobability density function has a tail that can be perceived as a power-law[32]. This behavior of unfrustrated spinglass is similar to the behavior of proteins and Lennard-Jones\nclusters; therefore, one can consider the unfrustrated spin-glass as a better alternative to\nthe frustrated spin-glass in the study of such systems.\n\n14\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Paolo De Los Rios for suggesting the significance of frustration,\nMarcel Ausloos for bringing our attention to the Weibull-distribution, Qasem Exirifard for\ncareful reading the manuscript and Nima Hamedani Radja for valuable discussions.\n\n[1] David Wales.
