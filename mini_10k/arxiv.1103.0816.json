Denote\nZ\nm(A) =\nmax\nA(x) d\u03bd(x),\n\u03bd an invariant probability for T\n\nand, \u03bc\u221e,A , any probability which attains the maximum value. We will assume that the maximizing\nprobability \u03bc\u221e is unique and has support in a periodic orbit. We denote by T the left-shift acting on\nthe space of points (w, x) \u2208 {1, 2, 3, .., d}Z = \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 = \u03a3\u0302. For a given potential Holder A : \u03a3 \u2192 R, where\nA acts on the variable x, we say that a Holder continuous function W : \u03a3\u0302 \u2192 R is a involution kernel for\nA (where A\u2217 acts on the variable w), if there is a Holder function A\u2217 : \u03a3 \u2192 R, such that,\nA\u2217 (w) = A \u25e6 T\u22121 (w, x) + W \u25e6 T\u22121 (w, x) \u2212 W (w, x).\nA\u2217\n\nSuch\nand W exists when A is Holder. One can also consider V \u2217 the calibrated subaction for A\u2217 ,\nand, the maximizing probability \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 for A\u2217 .\nThe following result expression is known: for any given x \u2208 \u03a3, it is true the relation\nV (x) = sup [ (W (w, x) \u2212 I \u2217 (w)) \u2212 V \u2217 (w) ],\nw\u2208\u03a3\n\nwhere I \u2217 is non-negative lower semicontinuous function (it can attain the value \u221e in some points). In\nthis way V and V \u2217 form a dual pair. I \u2217 is a deviation function for a Large Deviation Principle.\nFor each x one can get one (or, more than one) wx such attains the supremum above. That is,\nsolutions of\nV (x) = W (wx , x) \u2212 V \u2217 (wx ) \u2212 I \u2217 (wx ) .\nA pair of the form (x, wx ) is called an optimal pair.\nUnder some technical assumptions, we show that generically on the potential A, the set of possible\noptimal wx , when x covers the all range of possible elements x in \u2208 \u03a3, is finite.\nAMS classification: 37A05, 37A35, 37A60, 37D35 - Key words - Ergodic Optimization, Subaction,\nMaximizing probability, Transport Theory, Twist condition, Generic Property\n\n1.

Any one of these probabilities \u03bc\u221e,A is\ncalled a maximizing probability for A.\nWe will assume here that the maximizing probability is unique and has support in a periodic orbit.\nAn important conjecture claims that this property is generic (see [16] for partial results).\nDate: October 26, 2018 - (*) CIMAT, Guanajuato, CP: 36240, Mexico (**) Instituto de Matem\u00e1tica, UFRGS, 91509-900\n- Porto Alegre, Brasil.

A generalization of such problems from the point of view of Ergodic Transport can be found\nin [32].\nWe denote the set of \u03b1-Holder potentials on \u03a3 by C \u03b1 (\u03a3, R).\nIf A is Holder, and, the maximizing probability for A is unique, then the probability \u03bc\u221e,A is the limit\nof the Gibbs states \u03bc\u03b2 A , for the potentials \u03b2A, when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e [16] [17]. Therefore, our analysis concerns\nGibbs probabilities at zero temperature (\u03b2 = 1/T ).\nThe metric d in \u03a3 is defined by\nd(\u03c9, \u03bd) := \u03bbN ,\n\nN := min{ k \u2208 N | \u03c9k 6= \u03bdk }.\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe norm we consider in the set C (\u03a3, R) of \u03b1-Holder potentials A is\n||A||\u03b1 =\n\n|A(x) \u2212 A(y)|\n+ sup |A(x)|.\nd(x, y)\u03b1\nx\u2208\u03a3\nd(x,y)<\u03b5\nsup\n\nWe denote \u03a3\u0302 = \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 = {1, 2, 3, .., d}Z, and, we use the notation x\u0304 = (...x\u22122 , x\u22121 | x0 , x1 , x2 , ..) \u2208\n\u03a3\u0302, w = (x0 , x1 , x2 , ..) \u2208 \u03a3, x = (x\u22121 , x\u22122 , ..) \u2208 \u03a3. Sometimes we denote x\u0304 = (w, x). We say w =\n(x0 , x1 , x2 , ..) are the future coordinates of x\u0304 and x = (x\u22121 , x\u22122 , ..) \u2208 \u03a3 are the past coordinates of x\u0304.\nWe also use the notation: \u03c3 is the shift acting in the past coordinates w and T is the shift acting in the\nfuture coordinates x. Moreover, T is the (right side)-shift on \u03a3\u0302, that is,\nT\u22121 (...x\u22122 , x\u22121 | x0 , x1 , x2 , ..) = (...x\u22122 , x\u22121 x0 | x1 , x2 , ..).\nAs we said before we denote the action of the shift in the coordinates x by T , that is,\nT (x\u22121 , x\u22122 , x\u22122 ..) = (x\u22122 , x\u22123 , x\u22124 ..).\nFor w = (x0 , x1 , x2 , ..) \u2208 \u03a3, x = (x\u22121 , x\u22122 , ..) \u2208 \u03a3, denote \u03c4w (x) = (x0 , x\u22121 , x\u22122 , ..).\nWe use sometimes the simplified notation \u03c4w = \u03c4x0 , because the dependence on w is just on the first\nsymbol x0 ,\nUsing the simplified notation x\u0304 = (w, x), we have\nT\u22121 (w, x) = ( \u03c3(w), \u03c4w (x) ).\nWe also define \u03c4k,a x = (ak , ak\u22121 , ..., a1 , x0 , x1 , x2 , ...), where x = (x0 , x1 , x2 , ...), a = (a1 , a2 , a3 , ...).\nBellow we consider that A acts on the past coordinate x and A\u2217 acts on the future coordinate w.\nDefinition 1.2. Consider A : \u03a3 \u2192 R Holder. We say that a Holder continuous function W : \u03a3\u0302 \u2192 R is\na involution kernel for A, if there is a Holder function A\u2217 : \u03a3 \u2192 R, such that,\nA\u2217 (w) = A \u25e6 T\u22121 (w, x) + W \u25e6 T\u22121 (w, x) \u2212 W (w, x).\nWe say that A\u2217 is a dual potential of A, or, that A and A\u2217 are in involution.\nThe above expression can be also written as\nA\u2217 (w) = A(\u03c4w (x)) + W ( \u03c3(w), \u03c4w (x) ) \u2212 W (w, x).\nTheorem 1.1. [2] Given A Holder there exist a Holder W which is an involution kernel for A.\nWe call \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 the maximizing probability for A\u2217 (it is unique if A has a unique maximizing \u03bc\u221e A , as\none can see in [2])\nTo consider a dual problem is quite natural in our setting. Note that m(A) = m(A\u2217 ) (see [2]).\nWe denote by K = K(\u03bc\u221e,A , \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 ) the set of probabilities \u03b7\u0302(w, x) on \u03a3\u0302, such that \u03c0x\u2217 (\u03b7\u0302) = \u03bc\u221e,A ,\nand also that \u03c0y\u2217 (\u03b7\u0302) = \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 .\nWe are interested in the solution \u03bc\u0302 of the Kantorovich Transport Problem for \u2212W , that is, the solution\nof\nZ Z\ninf\n\u2212W (w, x) d \u03b7\u0302.\n\u03b7\u0302\u2208K\n\n\fNote that in the definition of W we use the dynamics of T. Note also that if we consider a new cost\nof the form c(x, w) = \u2212W (x, w) + \u03c6(w), instead of \u2212W , where \u03c6 bounded and measurable, then we do\nnot change the original minimization problem.\nDefinition 1.3. A calibrated sub-action V : \u03a3 \u2192 R for the potential A, is a continuous function V such\nthat\nsup\n\n{ V (y) + A(y) \u2212 m(A) } = V (x).\n\ny such that T (y) = x\n\nWe denote by V \u2217 a calibrated subction for A\u2217 .\nIf V is calibrated it is true that for any z in the support of the maximizing probability V (z) + A(z) \u2212\nm(A) = V (T (z). Generically (on the Holder class) on A, one can show that this equality it true just on\nthe support of the maximizing probability. An important issue here is to know if this last property is\nalso true for the maximizing probability of A\u2217 . We address this question in the last sections.\nWe denote by \u03bc\u0302 the minimizing probability over \u03a3\u0302 = {1, 2, 3, .., d}Z for the natural Kantorovich\nTransport Problem associated to the \u2212W , where W is the involution kernel for A (see [2]).\nWe call \u03bc\u0302max the natural extension of \u03bc\u221e,A as described in [2] [38].\nIn [28] was shown (not assuming the maximizing probability is a periodic orbit) that:\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose the maximizing probability for A Holder is unique (not necessarily a periodic\norbit). Then, the minimizing Kantorovich probability \u03bc\u0302 on \u03a3\u0302 associated to \u2212W , where W is the involution\nkernel for A, is \u03bc\u0302max .\nMoreover, it was shown in [28]:\nTheorem 1.3. Suppose the maximizing probability is unique (not necessarily a periodic orbit). If V is\nthe calibrated subaction for A, and V \u2217 is the calibrated subaction for A\u2217 , then, the pair (\u2212V, \u2212V \u2217 ) is the\ndual (\u2212W )-Kantorovich pair of (\u03bc\u221e,A , \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 ).\nThe solution cames from the so called complementary slackness condition [8] [40] [41] which were\nobtained in proposition 10 (1) [2]. We can assume that \u03b3 in [2] is equal to zero.\nOne can consider in the Bernoulli space \u03a3 = {0, 1}N the lexicographic order. In this way, x < z, if\nand only if, the first element i such that, xj = zj for all j < i, and xi 6= zi , satisfies the property xi < zi .\nMoreover, (0, x1 , x2 , ...) < (1, x1 , x2 , ...).\nOne can also consider the more general case \u03a3 = {0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1}N, but in order to simplify the notation\nand to avoid technicalities, we consider only the case \u03a3 = {0, 1}N. We also suppose, from now on, that\n\u03a3\u0302 = \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3.\nDefinition 1.4. We say a continuous G : \u03a3\u0302 = \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 R satisfies the twist condition on \u03a3\u0302, if for any\n(a, b) \u2208 \u03a3\u0302 = \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 and (a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3, with a\u2032 > a, b\u2032 > b, we have\n(1)\n\nG(a, b) + G(a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) < G(a, b\u2032 ) + G(a\u2032 , b).\n\nDefinition 1.5. We say a continuous A : \u03a3 \u2192 R satisfies the twist condition, if its involution kernel W\nsatisfies the twist condition.\nExamples of twist potentials are presented in [28].\nOne of the main results in [28] is:\nTheorem 1.4. Suppose the maximizing probability is unique (not necessarily a periodic orbit) and W\nsatisfies the twist condition on \u03a3\u0302, then, the support of \u03bc\u0302max = \u03bc\u0302 on \u03a3\u0302 is a graph (up to one possible\norbit).\nGiven A : \u03a3 = P\n{1, 2, .., d}N \u2192 R Holder, the Ruelle operator LA : C 0 (\u03a3) \u2192 C 0 (\u03a3) is given by\nLA (\u03c6)(x) = \u03c8(x) = T (z)=x eA(z) \u03c6(z).\nWe also consider LA\u2217 acting on continuous functions in \u03a3 = {1, 2, .., d}N.\nWe also denote by \u03c6A and \u03c6A\u2217 the corresponding eigen-functions associated to the main common\neigenvalue \u03bb(A) of the operators LA and LA\u2217 (see [36]).\n\n\f\u03bdA , and, \u03bdA\u2217 are respectively the eigen-probabilities for the dual of the Ruelle operator LA and LA\u2217 .\nFinally, \u03bcA = \u03bdA \u03c6A = and \u03bcA\u2217 = \u03bdA\u2217 \u03c6A\u2217 are the invariant probabilities such that they are solution\nof the respective pressure problems for A and A\u2217 . The probability \u03bcA is called the Gibbs measure for\nthe potential A.\nIf the maximizing probability is unique, then, it is easy to see that considering for any real \u03b2 the\npotential \u03b2A and the corresponding \u03bc\u03b2 A , then, \u03bc\u03b2 A \u2192 \u03bc\u221e ,A , when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nIn the same way, if we take any real \u03b2, the potential \u03b2A\u2217 , and, the corresponding \u03bc\u03b2 A\u2217 , then \u03bc\u03b2 A\u2217 \u2192\n\u03bc\u221e ,A\u2217 , when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nIn Statistical Mechanics \u03b2 = T1 where T is temperature. Then, \u03bc\u221e,A is the version of the Gibbs\nprobability at temperature zero.\nOne can choose c (a normalization constant) such that\nZ Z\n\n(2)\n\neW (w,x)\u2212c d\u03bdA\u2217 (w) d\u03bdA (x) = 1,\n\nA calibrated sub-action V can obtained as the limit [16] [17]\n(3)\n\nV (x) = lim\n\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nlog \u03c6\u03b2A (x).\n\u03b2\n\nIn the same way we can get a calibrated sub-action V \u2217 for A\u2217 by taking\n1\n(4)\nV \u2217 (w) = lim\nlog \u03c6\u03b2A\u2217 (w) .\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u03b2\nMoreover, by [2]\n(5)\n\n\u03c6A\u2217 (w) =\n\nZ\n\ne WA (w,x)\u2212c d\u03bdA (x),\n\nand,\n(6)\n\n\u03c6A (x) =\n\nZ\n\ne WA (w,x)\u2212c d\u03bdA\u2217 (w) =\n\nZ\n\ne WA (w,x)\u2212c\n\n1\nd\u03bcA\u2217 (w).\n\u03c6A\u2217\n\nNote that if W and A\u2217 define an involution for A, then, given any real \u03b2, we have that \u03b2 W and \u03b2 A\u2217\ndefine an involution for the potential \u03b2 A. The normalizing constant c, of course, changes with \u03b2 (see\n[2]).\nWe say a family of probabilities \u03bc\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, satisfies a Large Deviation Principle, if there is function\nI : \u03a3 \u2192 R \u222a \u221e, which is non-negative, lower semi-continuous, and such that, for any cylinder K \u2282 \u03a3, we\nhave\n1\nlim\nlog(\u03bc\u03b2 (K)) = \u2212 inf I(z).\nz\u2208K\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u03b2\nIn this case we say the I is the deviation function. The function I can take the value \u221e in some points.\nIn [2] a Large Deviation Principle is described for the family \u03bc\u03b2 = \u03bc\u03b2A of equilibrium states for \u03b2A,\nunder the assumption that the maximizing probability for A is unique (see also [31] for a different case\nwhere it is not assumed uniqueness). The function I is zero on the support of the maximizing probability\nfor A. We point out that there are examples where I can be zero outside the support (even when the\nmaximizing probability is unique) as we will show bellow in an example due to R. Leplaideur.\nApplying the same to A\u2217 we get a deviation function I \u2217 : \u03a3 \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e}.\nThe function I \u2217 is defined by\nI \u2217 (w) =\n\nX\n\nn\u2265 0\n\nwhere V\n\n\u2217\n\nis a fixed calibrated subaction.\n\n\u0001\nV \u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 V \u2217 \u2212 A\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 n (w),\n\n\fWe point out that in fact the claim of theorem 1.3 should say more precisely that the pair (\u2212V, \u2212V \u2217 )\nis the dual (\u2212W + I \u2217 )-Kantorovich pair of (\u03bc\u221e,A , \u03bc\u221e,A\u2217 ).\nUsing the property (6) above, and, adapting Varadhan's Theorem [18] to the present setting, it is\nshown in [28], that given any x \u2208 \u03a3, then, it is true the relation\nV (x) = sup [ W (w, x) \u2212 V \u2217 (w) \u2212 I \u2217 (w) ].\nw\u2208\u03a3\n\nFor each x we get one (or, more than one) wx such attains the supremum above. Therefore,\nV (x) = W (wx , x) \u2212 V \u2217 (wx ) \u2212 I \u2217 (wx ) .\nA pair of the form (x, wx ) is called an optimal pair. We can also say that wx is optimal for x.\nGiven A the involution kernel W and the dual potential A\u2217 are not unique. But, the above maximization\nproblem is intrinsic on A. That is, if we take another A\u2217 and the corresponding W , there is some\ncanceling, and we get the same problem as above (given x the optimal wx does not change).\nIt is also true that (see [28]) there exists \u03b3 such that for any w\n\u03b3 + V \u2217 (w) = sup [ W (w, x) \u2212 V (x) \u2212 I(x) ].\nx\u2208\u03a3\n\nGiven w, a solution of the above maximization is denoted by xw . We denote the pair (xw , w) a\n\u2217-optimal pair.\nWe assume without lost of generality that \u03b3 = 0, by adding \u2212\u03b3 to the function W .\nDefinition 1.6. The set of all (x, wx ), is called the optimal set for A, and, denoted by O(A).\nRemark 1: Note that in [28] it was shown that, under the twist assumption, the support of the\noptimal transport periodic probability \u03bc\u0302A , for the cost \u2212W , is a graph, that is, for each x, there is only\none w such that (x, w) is in the support of \u03bc\u0302A . But, nothing is said about the graph property of the set\nO(A). Note that the support of \u03bc\u0302A is contained in O(A).\nRemark 2: Note also that the minimal transport problem for the cost \u2212W , or the cost \u2212W + I \u2217 is\nthe same (see [28]).\nOur main result is:\nTheorem 1.5. Generically, in the set of potentials Holder potentials A that satisfy\n(i) the twist condition,\n(ii) uniqueness of maximizing probability which is supported in a periodic orbit,\nthe set of possible optimal wx , when x covers the all range of possible elements x in \u2208 \u03a3, is finite.\nWe point out that this is a result for points outside the support of the maximizing probability.\nIn the first two sections we will show that under certain conditions the set of possible optimal wx is\nfinite, for any x. In section 3 and 4 we will show that these conditions are generic.\nIn [29] it is also considered the twist condition and results for the analytic setting are obtained.\n\n\f2. The twist property\nIn order to simplify the notation we assume that m(A) = m(A\u2217 ) = 0.\nGiven A, we denote\n\u2206(x, x\u2032 , y) =\n\nX\n\nA \u25e6 \u03c4y,n (x) \u2212 A \u25e6 \u03c4y,n (x\u2032 ).\n\nn\u22651\n\nThe involution kernel W can be computed for any (\u03c9, x) by W (\u03c9, x) = \u2206A (\u03c9, x, x), where we choose\na point x for good.\nIt is known the following relation: for any x, x\u2032 , w \u2208 \u03a3, we have that W (w, x) \u2212 W (w, x\u2032 ) = \u2206(w, x, x\u2032 )\n(see [2])\nWe assume from now on that A satisfies the twist condition. It is known in this case (see [5] [30]),\nthat x \u2192 wx (can be multivaluated) is monotonous decreasing.\nProposition 2.1. If A is twist, then x \u2192 wx is monotonous decreasing.\nProof: See [29] \u0004\nWe define R by the expression R(x) = V (\u03c3(x)) \u2212 V (x) \u2212 A(x) \u2265 0, and, we define R\u2217 by R\u2217 (w) =\nV (\u03c3(w)) \u2212 V \u2217 (w) \u2212 A\u2217 (w) \u2265 0.\nNote that given y, there is a preimage x of y, such that, R(x) = 0. The analogous property is true for\nR\u2217 .\nGiven A (and a certain choice of A\u2217 and W ) the next result (which does not assume the twist condition)\nclaims that the dual of R is R\u2217 , and the corresponding involution kernel is (V \u2217 + V \u2212 W ).\n\u2217\n\nProposition 2.2. (Fundamental Relation)(FR)\nR(\u03c4w x) = (V \u2217 + V \u2212 W )(x, w) \u2212 (V \u2217 + V \u2212 W )(\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)) + R\u2217 (w).\nProof: see [29] \u0004\nWe know that the calibrated subaction satisfies\nV (x) = max(\u2212V \u2217 \u2212 I \u2217 + W )(x, w).\nw\u2208\u03a3\n\nThen, we define\nb(x, w) = (V \u2217 + V + I \u2217 \u2212 W )(x, w) \u2265 0,\nand,\n\u0393V = {(x, w) \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3|V (x) = (\u2212V \u2217 \u2212 I \u2217 + W )(x, w)},\nwhich can be written in an equivalent form\n\u0393V = {(x, w) \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3 | b(x, w) = 0}.\nGiven x, this maximum at wx can not be realized where I \u2217 (w) is infinity.\nRemark 3: Note, that b(x, w) = 0, if and only if, (x, w) is an optimal pair. We are not\nsaying anything for \u2217-optimal pairs.\nIf we use R\u2217 (w) = I \u2217 (w) \u2212 I \u2217 (\u03c3w), the FR becomes\nR(\u03c4w x) = (V \u2217 + V \u2212 W )(x, w) \u2212 (V \u2217 + V \u2212 W )(\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)) + I \u2217 (w) \u2212 I \u2217 (\u03c3(w)),\nor\nR(\u03c4w x) = b(x, w) \u2212 b(\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w))\nFrom this main equation we get:\n\nFR1.\n\n\fLemma 2.1. If T\u22121 (x, w) = (\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)), then\na) b \u2212 b \u25e6 T\u22121 (x, w) = R(\u03c4w x);\nb) The function b it is not decreasing in the trajectories of T;\nc) \u0393V is backward invariant;\nd) when (x, w) is optimal then R(\u03c4w (x)) = 0.\nProof:\nThe first one its a trivial consequence of the definition of T\u22121 . The second one it is a consequence of\nR \u2265 0:\nb \u2212 b \u25e6 T\u22121 (x, w) = R(\u03c4w x) \u2265 0\nb(x, w) \u2265 b \u25e6 T\u22121 (x, w).\nIn order to see the third part we observe that\n(x, w) \u2208 \u0393V \u21d4 b(x, w) = 0\nSince\nb(x, w) \u2265 b \u25e6 T\u22121 (x, w) \u2265 0\nwe get b(\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)) = 0 thus (\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)) \u2208 \u0393V . \u0004\nFrom the above we get that in the case (x, w) is optimal, then, T\u22121 (x, w) is also optimal. Indeed, we\nhave that\nb(x, w) = 0 \u21d2 b(\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)) = 0.\nThis is equivalent to\nV (x) = \u2212V \u2217 (w) \u2212 I \u2217 (w) \u2212 W (x, w) \u21d2\nV (\u03c4w x) = \u2212V \u2217 (\u03c3(w)) \u2212 I \u2217 (\u03c3(w)) \u2212 W (\u03c4w x, \u03c3(w)).\nIn this way T\u2212n spread optimal pairs.\nWe denote by M the support of the maximizing probability periodic orbit.\nConsider the compact set of points P = {w \u2208 \u03a3, such that \u03c3(w) \u2208 M , and w is not on M }.\nDefinition 2.1. We say that A is good if, for each w \u2208 P , we have that R\u2217 (w) > 0.\nWe alternatively, say sometimes that R\u2217 is good for A\u2217 .\nWe point out that there are examples of potentials A\u2217 (with a unique maximizing probability) where\nthe corresponding R\u2217 is not good (see Example 1 in the end of the present section) .\nRemember that ,\nX\nX\n\u0001\nI \u2217 (w) =\nV \u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 V \u2217 \u2212 A\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 n (w) =\nR\u2217 (\u03c3 n (w)).\nn\u2265 0\n\nn\u2265 0\n\n\u2217\n\nIn [30] section 5 it is shown that if I (w) is finite, then\nn\u22121\n1X\n\u03b4\u03c3j (w) \u2192 \u03bc\u2217\u221e .\nn\u2192\u221e n\nj=0\n\nlim\n\nOne important assumption here is that R\u2217 is good. We will show later that this property is true for\ngeneric potentials A.\nProposition 2.3. Assume A is good. If I \u2217 (w) < \u221e, then, w is in the preimage of the maximizing\nprobability for A\u2217 .\nFor a proof see section 5 in [30]\n\n\fProposition 2.4. Suppose (x, wx ) is an optimal pair, and, A is good, then, there exists k, such that,\nw\u0303k = \u03c3 k (wx ) is in the support of the maximizing probability for A\u2217 . Moreover, for such k, we have that\nT\u2212k (x, wx ) is an optimal pair.\nProof:\nSuppose (x, wx ) is optimal. Therefore, I \u2217 (wx ) < \u221e. Then, by a previous proposition, wx is in the\npre-image of the maximizing probability for A\u2217 , that is, there exists k such that w\u0303 = \u03c3 k (wx ) is in the\nsupport of the maximizing probability for A\u2217 .\nMoreover, b(T\u2212k (x, wx )) = (xk , \u03c3 k (wx )) = (xk , w\u0303k ) is also optimal. \u0004\nProposition 2.5. Assume A is good, then, the set of w such that I \u2217 (w) < \u221e is countable.\nDefinition 2.2. We say a continuous A : \u03a3 \u2192 R satisfies the the countable condition, if there are a\ncountable number of possible optimal wx , when x ranges over the interval \u03a3.\nRemark: If A is good, then, it satisfies the countable condition.\nWe showed before that the twist property implies that for x < x\u2032 , if b(x, w) = 0 and b(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) = 0,\nthen w\u2032 < w, which means that the optimal sequences are monotonous not increasing. Thus, we define\nthe \"turning point c\" as being the maximum of the point x that has his optimal sequence starting in\n1:\nc = sup{x | b(x, w) = 0 \u21d2 w = (1 w1 w2 ...)}.\nThe main criteria is the following:\n\"If x \u2208 \u03c3 has the optimal sequence w = (w0 w1 w2 ...) then\n\u001a\n1, if x \u2208 [0\u221e , c]\nw0 =\n0, if x \u2208 (c, 1\u221e ]\"\nStarting from (x0 , w0 ) we can iterate FR1 by T\u2212n (x, w) = (xn , wn ) in order to obtain new points\nw1 , w2 ... \u2208 \u03a3. Unless the only possible optimal point wx , for all x, is a fixed point for \u03c3, then, 0 < c < 1.\nNote that for c there are two optimal pairs (c, w) and (c, w\u2032 ), where the first symbol of w is zero, and,\nthe first symbol of w\u2032 is one.\nWe denote\nB(w) = {x | b(x, w) = 0}.\nLemma 2.2. (Characterization of optimal change) Let c \u2208 (0\u221e , 1\u221e ) be the turning point then, for any\nx < x\u2032 and b(x, w) = 0 and b(x\u2032 , w\u2032 ) = 0, we have w 6= w\u2032 if, and only if, there exists n \u2265 0 such that\nT n (c) \u2208 [x, x\u2032 ]. Moreover, if x, x\u2032 are such that wx and wx\u2032 are identical until the n coordinate, then,\nT n (c) \u2208 (x, x\u2032 ).\nEach set B(w) = [a, b] is such that a = T n (c), or, a it is accumulated by a subsequence of T j (c) from\nthe left side. Similar property is true for b (accumulated by the right side).\nProof. Step 0\nIf x < x\u2032 \u2264 c then w0 = w0\u2032 = 1 else if c < x < x\u2032 then w0 = w0\u2032 = 0. Suppose w0 = w0\u2032 =\u2208 {0, 1} then\napplying FR1 we get \u03c4i x < \u03c4i x\u2032 and b(\u03c4i x, (w1 w2 ...)) = 0 and b(\u03c4i x\u2032 , (w1\u2032 w2\u2032 ...)) = 0.\nStep 1\nIf \u03c4i x < \u03c4i x\u2032 \u2264 c then w1 = w1\u2032 = 1 else if c < \u03c4i x < \u03c4i x\u2032 then w1 = w1\u2032 = 0. Otherwise if \u03c41 x < c < \u03c41 x\u2032\nwe can use the monotonicity of T in each branch in order to get x < T (c) < x\u2032 . Thus\nw1 6= w1\u2032 \u21d4 x < T (c) < x\u2032 .\nThe conclusion comes by iterating this algorithm.\nThe last claim is obvious from the above.\n\u0003\n\n\fA point x is called pre-periodic (or, eventually periodic) if there is n 6= m, such that, T n (x) = T m (x).\nWe denote [a, b], a, b \u2208 \u03a3, a \u2264 b, the set of all points w in \u03a3 such a \u2264 w \u2264 b. We call [a, b] the interval\ndetermined by a and b. Each interval [a, b], with a < b, is not countable\nLemma 2.3. The set\nB(w) = {x | b(x, w) = 0}\nis an interval (can eventually be a single point). More specifically, if B(w) = [a, b], then, a and b are\nadherence points of the orbit of c.\nIn particular, if c is pre-periodic, then, for any non-empty B(w), there exists n, m such that B(w) =\n[T n (c), T m (c)] (unless B(w) is of the form [0, b], or [a, 1].\nFor a proof see [29].\nLemma 2.4. Let c \u2208 \u03a3 be the turning point. Let us suppose the c is isolated from his orbit, which means\nthat, there is d, e, w\u2212 and w+ , such that, b(x, w\u2212 ) = 0, for any x \u2208 (d, c], and, b(x, w+ ) = 0, for any\nx \u2208 [c, e), then, there is no accumulation points of the orbit of c. In this case c is eventually periodic.\nFor a proof see [29].\nRemark 4: The main problem we have to face is the possibility that the orbit of c is dense in [0, 1].\nIf c is eventually periodic there exist just a finite number intervals B(w) with positive length. The\nother B(w) are reduced to points and they are also finite.\nLemma 2.5. Suppose A satisfies the twist and the countable condition. Then there is at least one B(w)\nwith positive length of the form (T n (c), T m (c)). Moreover, for each subinterval (a, b) there exists at least\none B(w) with positive length of the form (T n (c), T m (c)) contained on it. Therefore, there exists an\ninfinite number of such intervals.\nDenote the possible w, such that, I \u2217 (w) < \u221e, by wj , j \u2208 N.\nFor each wj , j \u2208 N, denote Ij = B(wj ), the maximal interval where for all x \u2208 Ij , we have that,\n(x, wj ) is an optimal pair. Some of these intervals could be eventually a point, but, an infinite number\nof them have positive length, because the set \u03a3 is not countable. We consider from now on just the ones\nwith positive length.\nNote that by the same reason, in each subinterval (e, u), there exists an infinite countable number of\nB(w) with positive length.\nWe suppose, by contradiction, that each interval B(w) = [a, b], with positive length is such that, each\nside is approximated by a sub-sequence of points T j (c).\nTake one interval (a1 , b1 ) with positive length inside \u03a3. There is another one (a2 , b2 ) inside (0\u221e , a1 ),\nand one more (a3 , b3 ) inside (b1 , 1\u221e ).\nIf we remove from the interval \u03a3 these three intervals we get four intervals. Using our hypothesis, we can\nfind new intervals with positive length inside each one of them. Then we do the same removal procedure\nas before. This procedure is similar to the construction of the Cantor set. If we proceed inductively on\nthis way, the set of points x which remains after infinite steps is not countable. An uncountable number\nof such x has a different wx . This is not possible because the optimal wx are countable.\nThen, the first claim of the lemma is true.\nGiven an interval (a, b) \u2282 \u03a3, we can do the same and use the fact that (a, b) is not countable.\n\u0004\nLemma 2.6. Under the twist and the countable condition the turning point c is eventually periodic.\nProof:\nDenote by wj , j \u2208 N, the countable set of pre-images of the periodic orbit maximizing A\u2217 .\nFor each wj , j \u2208 N, denote Ij = B(wj ), the maximal interval where for all x \u2208 Ij , we have that,\n(x, wj ) is an optimal pair. Some of these intervals could be, eventually, a point, but, an infinite number\nof them have positive length, because the set \u03a3 is not countable\n\n\fWe will suppose c is not eventually periodic, and, we will reach a contradiction. Therefore, if T n (c) =\nT (c), then m = n.\nFrom, now on we consider just j, such that, for the corresponding wj , the interval Ij has positive\nlength, and, it is of the form [T n (c), T m (c)], m, n \u2265 1. From last lemma there exist an infinite number of\nthem.\nDenote by Ij = [aj , bj ]. We denote I0 the interval of the form [0\u221e , b0 ], and, I1 the interval of the form\n[a0 , 1\u221e ]. From last lemma, for j 6= 0, 1, there is nj and mj , such that aj = T nj (c) and bj = T mj (c).\nConsider the inverse branch \u03c4ij , where ij1 = i1 is such that \u03c4i1 ((T nj )(c)) = T nj \u22121 (c). This i1 do not\n1\nhave to be the first symbol of the optimal w for T nj (c). Then, \u03c4i1 (Ij ) is another interval, which is\nstrictly inside a domain of injectivity of T , does not contain any forward image of c, and in its left side\nwe have the point T nj \u22121 (c).\nThen, repeating the same procedure inductively, we get i2 , such that \u03c4i2 ((T nj \u22121 )(c)) = T nj \u22122 (c),\ndetermining another interval which does not contain any forward image of c, and in his left side we have\nthe point T nj \u22122 (c). Repeating the reasoning over and over again, always taking the same inverse branch\nwhich contain T n (c), 0 \u2264 n \u2264 nj , after nj times we arrive in an interval of the form (c, rj ). Note that\neach inverse branch preserves order. It is not possible to have an iterate T k (c), k \u2208 N, inside this interval\n(c, rj ) (by the definition of Ij ). Then, the optimal w for x in this interval (c, rj ) is a certain w\u0303j which\ncan be different of \u03c3 nj (wj ).\nSuppose now that nj > mj . Using the analogous procedure we get that there exists rj , such that the\noptimal wx for x in the interval (rj , c) is \u03c3 nj (wj ).\nIf both cases happen, then c is eventually periodic.\nThe trouble happens when just one type of inequality is true. Suppose without lost of generality that\nwe have always nj < mj , for all possible j.\nLet's fix for good a certain j.\nTherefore, all we can get with the above procedure is that c is isolated by the right side\nIn the procedure of taking pre-image of T nj (c), always following the forward orbit T n (x), 0 \u2264 n \u2264 nj ,\nwe will get a sequence of i1 , i2 , ..., inj . In the first step we have two possibilities: \u03c4i1 (T m\u2212j (c)) = T mj \u22121 (c),\nor not.\nIf it happens the second case, we are done. Indeed, the interval \u03c4i1 [T nj (c), T mj (c))] does not contain\nforward images of c (otherwise [T nj (c)), T mj (c))] would also have). Now we follow the same procedure\nas before, but, this time following the branches which contains the orbit of T m (c), 0 \u2264 m \u2264 mj . In this\nway, we get that c is isolated by the left side.\nSuppose \u03c4i1 (T mj (c)) = T mj \u22121 (c). Consider the interval, [T nj \u22121 (c)), T mj \u22121 (c))], which do not contain\nforward images of c.\nNow, you can ask the same question: \u03c4i2 (T mj \u22121 (c)) = T mj \u22122 (c)? If this do not happen (called the\nsecond option), then, in the same way as before, we are done (c is also isolated by the right side). If the\nexpression is true, then, we proceed with the same reasoning as before.\nWe proceed in an inductive way until time nj . If in some time we have the second option, we are done,\notherwise, we show that any x \u2208 (c, T mj \u2212nj (c)) has a unique optimal wx (there is no forward image of c\ninside it).\nDenote k = mj \u2212 nj for the j we fixed.\nFrom the above we have that for any B(w), which is an interval of the form [T ni (c)), T mi (c))], for any\npossible i, it is true that mi \u2212 ni = k. There are an infinite number of intervals of this form.\nWe claim that the set of points x which are extreme points of any B(w\u0303), and, such that x can be\napproximated by the forward orbit of c is finite. Suppose without lost of generality that x is the right\npoint of a B(w) = (z, x).\nIf the above happens, then, by the last lemma, we have an infinite sequence of intervals of the form\n[T ni (c)), T ni +k (c))], such that T ni (c) \u2192 x, as ni \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, x is a periodic point of period k. There\nare a finite number of points of period k. This shows our main claim. Finally, c is eventually periodic.\n\u0004\nm\n\nDefinition 2.3. We denote by G the set of Holder potentials such that\n\n\f1) the maximizing probability is unique, and it is a periodic orbit;\n2) The potential A satisfies the twist condition;\n3) R\u2217 is good for A\u2217 .\nFrom the above one can get:\nTheorem 2.7. Suppose A is in G, then, for any x, there exists a finite number of possible wx such that\n(x, wx ) are optimal pairs. If we denote by Ij = (aj , bj ), j = 1, 2, .., n, the maximal open intervals where\nfor x \u2208 Ij the wx is constant, then, just on the points x = aj , or x = bj , we can get two different wx ,\nwhich define points (x, wx ) in the optimal set O(A).\nNote that if x is in the maximizing orbit for A \u2208 G, then, at least one of the optimal wx is in the\nsupport of the maximizing probability for A\u2217 . This point x can be eventually in the extreme of one of\nthis maximal intervals IJ . This do not contradicts the graph property\nDefinition 2.4. We denote by A the open set of Holder potentials such that\n1) the maximizing probability is unique, and it is a periodic orbit;\n2) The potential A satisfies the twist condition.\nThe next theorem shows the class we consider above is large.\nTheorem 2.8. The set G is generic in the open set A.\nThe proof of this result will be done in the next two sections (see Theorem 4.1 bellow).\nCorollary 2.9. For any A \u2208 G, the value c = cA is given by the expression\nc = inf{x | V (x) \u2212 V (\u03c41 x) \u2212 A(\u03c41 (x)) > 0},\nwhere V is any calibrated subaction for A. Moreover, cA is locally constant as a function of A.\nProof:\nThe first claim follows from the fact that we have to use 0 as first symbol of the optimal wx , when x\nis on the right of c.\nIf R\u2217 is good the point c is in the pre-image of the support of the maximizing probability (which is\nlocally constant by the continuous varying support property [16]). Therefore, the possible c are in a\ncountable set.\nNote that under the uniqueness hypothesis of the maximizing probability for A, the sub-action V = VA\ncan be chosen in a continuous fashion with A. From this follows the last claim of the corollary. \u0004\nNow we will provide a counterexample.\nExample 1. The following example is due to R. Leplaideur.\nWe will show an example on the shift where the maximizing probability for a certain Lipschitz potential A\u2217 : {0, 1}N \u2192 R is a unique periodic orbit \u03b3 of period two, denoted by p0 = (01010101...), p1 =\n(10101010...), but for a certain point, namely, w0 = (110101010..), which satisfies \u03c3(w0 ) = p1 , we have\nthat R\u2217 (w0 ) = 0.\nThe potential A\u2217 is given by A\u2217 (w) = \u2212d(w, \u03b3 \u222a \u0393), where d is the usual distance in the Bernoulli\nspace. The set \u0393 is described later.\nFor each integer n, we define a 2n + 3-periodic orbit zn , \u03c3(zn ), . . . , \u03c3 2n+2 (zn ) as follows:\nwe first set\nbn = (01010101\n|\n{z . . . 01} 1 01),\n2n\n\nand the point zn is the concatenation of the word bn : zn = (bn , bn , ...)\nThe main idea here is to get a sequence of periodic points which spin around the periodic orbit {p0 , p1 }\nduring the time 2 n, and then pass close by w0 (note that d(\u03c3 2 n (zn ), w0 ) = 2\u22122(n+1) ).\nDenote \u03b3n the periodic orbit \u03b3n = {zn , \u03c3(zn ), \u03c3 2 (zn ), ..., \u03c3 2n+2 (zn ) }.\n\n\fConsider the sequence of Lipschitz potentials A\u2217n (w) = \u2212d(w, \u03b3n \u222a \u03b3). The support of the maximizing\nprobability for A\u2217n is \u03b3n \u222a \u03b3. Moreover\nZ\n\u2217\n0 = m(An ) =\nmax\nA\u2217n (w) d\u03bd(w).\n\u03bd an invariant probability for \u03c3\n\nDenote by Vn\u2217 a Lipschitz calibrated subaction for A\u2217n such that Vn\u2217 (w0 ) = 0. In this way, for all w\nRn\u2217 (w) = (Vn\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 Vn\u2217 \u2212 A\u2217n ) (w) \u2265 0,\nand for w \u2208 \u03b3n \u222a \u03b3 we have that Rn\u2217 (w) = 0.\nWe know that Rn\u2217 is zero on the orbit \u03b3n , because \u03b3n is included in the Masur set.\nNote that we not necessarily have Rn\u2217 (w0 ) = 0.\nBy construction, the Lipschitz constant for A\u2217n is 1. This is also true for Vn\u2217 . Hence the family of\nsubactions (Vn\u2217 ) is a family of equicontinuous functions. Let us denote by V \u2217 any accumulation point for\n(Vn\u2217 ) for the C 0 -topology. Note that V \u2217 is also 1-Lipschitz continuous. For simplicity we set\nV \u2217 = lim Vn\u2217k .\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nWe denote by \u0393 the set which is the limit of the sets \u03b3n (using the Hausdorff distance). \u03b3 \u222a \u0393 is a\ncompact set. Note that \u0393 is not a compact set, but the set of accumulation points for \u0393 is the set \u03b3. We\nnow consider A\u2217 (w) = \u2212d(w, \u03b3 \u222a \u0393).\nAs any accumulation point of \u0393 is in \u03b3, any maximizing probability for the potential A\u2217 has support\nin \u03b3. On the contrary, the unique \u03c3-invariant measure with support in \u03b3 is maximizing for A\u2217 .\nRemember that for any n we have Vn\u2217 (w0 ) = 0.We also claim that we have A\u2217nk (w0 ) \u2192 0 and\n\u2217\nVnk (\u03c3(w0 )) \u2192 0, as k \u2192 \u221e.\nFor each fixed w we set\nRn\u2217 k (w) = (Vn\u2217k \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 Vn\u2217k \u2212 A\u2217nk ) (w) \u2265 0.\nThe right hand side terms converge (for the C 0 -topology) as k goes to +\u221e. Then Rn\u2217 k converge, and we\ndenote by R\u2217 its limit. Then for every w we have:\nR\u2217 (w) = (V \u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 V \u2217 \u2212 A\u2217 ) (w) \u2265 0.\nThis shows that V \u2217 is a subaction for A\u2217 . Note that R\u2217 (w0 ) = 0. From the uniqueness of the\nmaximizing probability for A\u2217 we know that there exists a unique calibrated subaction for A\u2217 (up to an\nadditive constant).\nConsider a fixed w and its two preimages wa and wb . For any given n, one of the two possibilities\noccur Rn\u2217 (wa ) = 0 or Rn\u2217 (wb ) = 0, because Vn\u2217 is calibrated for A\u2217n .\nTherefore, for an infinite number of values k either Rn\u2217 k (wa ) = 0 or Rn\u2217 k (wb ) = 0.\nIn this way the limit of Vn\u2217k is unique (independent of the convergent subsequence) and equal to V \u2217 ,\nthe calibrated subaction for A\u2217 (such that V \u2217 (w0 ) = 0).\nTherefore,\nR\u2217 (w0 ) = (V \u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212 V \u2217 \u2212 A\u2217 ) (w0 ) = 0,\nand V \u2217 is a calibrated subaction for A\u2217 (w) = d(w, \u03b3 \u222a \u0393).\n\n3. Generic continuity of the Aubry set.\nIn this section and in the next we will present the proof of the generic properties we mention before.\nIn order to do that we will need several general properties in Ergodic Optimization.\nRemember that we will denote the action of the shift in the points x by T , and, we leave \u03c3 for the\naction of the shift in the coordinates w.\nWe will present our main results in great generality.

By Arzel\u00e1-Ascoli theorem it is enough to prove that there is a unique\nF (x) = SA (x0 , x) which is the limit of any convergent subsequence of {Fn }. Since sup |An |\u03b1 < \u221e, by\ninequality (11), any such limit is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder. Since by lemma 3.4.(2), S(A) \u2229 [F (x0 ) = 0] = { F (x) =\nSA (x0 , x) }, it is enough to prove that any limit of a subsequence of {Fn } is a calibrated sub-action.

Let xn \u2208 Bn \u2192 A be such that xn \u2192 x0 . Let Fn \u2208 S(A) be such that IFn (xn ) = 0. Adding\na constant we can assume that Fn (x0 ) = 0 for all n. By (2), taking a subsequence we can assume that\n\u2203F = limn Fn in the C 0 topology. Then F is a C \u03b1 calibrated sub-action for A.
