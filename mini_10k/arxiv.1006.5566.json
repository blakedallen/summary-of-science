Introduction\nThe aim of this work is to elucidate at the Lagrangian level some unexpected indeterminacy in the motion\nof a geometric spinning particle model. The model was originally proposed in [1] and later rediscovered\nin quite a different context as the fundamental relativistic rotator [2]. We shall identify the cause of this\nindeterminacy and show that in the presence of external fields a constraint appears imposing unphysical\nlimitations on the motion and the freedom in choosing the initial conditions. To understand better this\nsingular behavior we found it instructive to contrast it with unique motion of other rotators from the family\nof relativistic rotators defined in [2] both in the presence and absence of interactions. First, we recall what\nrelativistic rotators are and discuss the distinguished role fundamental rotators play among them.\n1.1. Relativistic rotators\nThe underlying motivation behind Staruszkiewicz paper [2] was to design a mathematical mechanism\nsuitable for an ideal classical clock. This construction employed the notion of a rigid body of Hanson\nand Regge [3] \u2013 a rotating tetrad assigned to a worldline. A rotating tetrad can be realized as a continuous\naction of a proper ortochronous Lorentz operator on some initial tetrad. As observed in [2], such motion\ncan be equivalently described by specifying the motion of three distinct null directions. Recall, that a crossratio of four independent null directions is an invariant of homographic transformations (being in 2-to-1\ncorrespondence with the proper ortochronous Lorentz transformations [4]). Hence, the motion of the fourth\nnull direction forming the tetrad can be uniquely determined from the value of the cross-ratio. It is evident\nthat the number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f) is 9 (3 for position and 6 defining three null directions). A\nrotator in Newtonian physics has only five d.o.f. Accordingly, a relativistic counterpart of such a rotator is a\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n2\n\ndynamical system consisting of position and a single null direction. This particular example of a rigid body\nis called a relativistic rotator [2].\nThe canonical momenta of a rotating tetrad have too many d.o.f. This arbitrariness is characteristic of\nthe relativistic theory of spinning bodies [5]. To make the equations of motion determinate, it is customary\nto impose supplementary conditions reducing the number of d.o.f to the three rotational ones in the rest\nframe (the same as for the Eulerian rigid body). But there are interesting exceptions. Already a dynamical\nsystem described by a worldline and a single spinor of fixed magnitude has the correct number of d.o.f:\nthree for position, two for the spinor's direction and one for the spinor's phase associated with a rotation\nabout the spinor's direction. A general form of the Lagrangian for a single spinor can be found in [6]. In this\nframework, the Lagrangian of relativistic rotators can be alternatively arrived at by neglecting the spinor's\nmagnitude and its phase. Then one is left with the following Hamilton's action:\nZ\n\u221a\nk\u0307 k\u0307\nS = \u2212m d\u03c4 \u1e8b\u1e8bf (Q), Q \u2261 \u2212l2\nkk = 0, f \u2032 (Q) 6= 0, f (Q) > 0,\n(1.1)\n2,\n(k \u1e8b)\nthe same as originally defined in [2]. Here, a dot denotes differentiation with respect to an arbitrary worldline\nparameter \u03c4 . The physical configuration space is identical to R3 \u00d7 S2 . A point in R3 represents the actual\nposition whereas a point on the unit sphere S2 the actual direction in the physical space. By the symmetry\nargument, neither a particular initial position nor the direction can be distinguished. The same concerns the\nassociated initial velocities. The additional two auxiliary d.o.f present in the Lagrangian are gauge d.o.f of\nthe reparametrization and projection invariance, namely, the worldline parameter and the scale of the null\nvector. They do not alter the physical state and can be arbitrary functions.\nTo reduce the variety of Lagrangians possible in (1.1), it is postulated that both Casimir invariants of\nthe Poincar\u00e9 group should be fixed parameters rather than constants of motion [2]. This provides us with\ntwo distinct conditions which we shall call fundamental conditions:\n1\nP P = m2 ,\nW W = \u2212 m4 l 2 .\n(1.2)\n4\nHere, W \u03bc is the Pauli-Luba\u0144ski spin-pseudovector W \u03bc = \u2212 21 \u01eb\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 M\u03b1\u03b2 P\u03b3 , where P\u03bc and M\u03bc\u03bd are\nNoether constants of motion. Owing to property (1.2), a classical mechanical system can be identified by\nspecifying its invariant mass and spin. This feature can be regarded at the classical level as the counterpart\nof irreducibility characteristic of relativistic quantum states. By this analogy, relativistic dynamical systems\nfor which (1.2) hold are called fundamental dynamical systems and the other are called phenomenological\n[2]. It is a simple matter to demonstrate that there are only two relativistic rotators that are fundamental.\nTheir trajectories are extremals of the Hamilton's action (cf Appendix A):\nv\ns\nu\nZ\n\u221a u\nk\u0307 k\u0307\nt\n(1.3)\nS = \u2212m d\u03c4 \u1e8b\u1e8b 1 \u00b1 \u2212l2\n2.\n(k \u1e8b)\nThe existence of the two rotators is remarkable since there is no apparent reason for two differential\nequations for a single function f , originating from two distinct notions of mass and that of spin, to have\na common solution. Observe the exceptional fact that for the action of the form (1.1) the requirement that\nthe Casimir mass is a fixed parameter implies that the Casimir spin is also fixed, and vice versa (there is no\nsuch implication for more complicated dynamical systems, e.g. cf [7]).\nAs it happened many times in the history of science, quite unrelated motivations and various ways of\nthinking make people to come up, independently, with similar ideas. It should be mentioned that Lagrangian\n(1.3) was discovered before Staruszkiewicz by Kuzenko, Lyakhovich and Segal [1]. To find a unique\nLagrangian for their geometric model of a spinning particle, they also imposed the condition of constant\nmass and spin, which they called strong conservation.\nStaruszkiewicz suggested that a dynamical system like (1.3) is an ideal mathematical clock that could\nbe used in studying some difficult and not well-understood problems in special and general theory of\nrelativity [2]. The clocking mechanism is simple. The image of the spatial direction W \u03bc is represented\nby a fixed circle on the Riemann sphere of complex numbers, whereas the image of the null direction k \u03bc is\nrepresented by a point moving about that circle. The cycles of the clock are measured by means of counting\nthe number of times the phase assigned to the circular motion has been increased by 2\u03c0. Accordingly, the\nimages of W \u03bc and k \u03bc can be regarded as the clock's dial and the clock's hand, respectively.\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n3\n\n1.2. Outline of this work\nIt is important to exclude irregular Lagrangians on R3 \u00d7 S2 . To find such Lagrangians one simply has to\nrequire that a corresponding Hessian determinant must be vanishing. This condition will give rise to some\nsecond-order differential equation for function f present in (1.1). Surprisingly, it will also lead to the action\nfunctional (1.3). In this case only four equations of motion are independent. To identify the indeterminate\ndegree of freedom we construct in a covariant manner a parametric description of the most general solution.\nWe shall also examine the motion of relativistic rotators in the presence of the electromagnetic field.\nThis is done not without a reason. The customary form of the interaction assumed for charged particles\ncannot remove the Hessian singularity and a Hessian constraint appears closely linked with this singularity.\nIt constrains the evolution on R3 \u00d7 S2 and limits the freedom in choosing the initial data, breaking the\nsymmetry of R3 \u00d7 S2 and of the tangent space, even in the limit of infinitely weak fields. In finding\nconstraints of this kind the concept of the null space of a singular Hessian will show up useful. With this\nconstraint there is no reason to expect unique solutions for arbitrary fields. However, there are unique\nsolutions possible when stronger constraints compatible with the Hessian constraint are assumed, in which\ncase variations in the direction of the Hessian null space are excluded. All these observations will lead us to\nthe conclusion that relativistic rotators with identically fixed mass and spin are unphysical. In contrast, for\nregular Lagrangians on R3 \u00d7 S2 , the motion will turn out unique and not constrained, both in the presence\nand absence of fields.\nFollowing the Staruszkiewicz paper [2], there has been a growing interest in the fundamental relativistic\nrotator [8, 9]. However, the central deficiency of the Lagrangian, showing up in the Hessian singularity and\nthe associated indeterminacy of the equations of motion on R3 \u00d7S2 , has been unnoticed (except for in papers\n[6] and [7], where this singularity was already alluded to in the context of more general models, but compare\nalso the original unpublished paper [10] where the central results were found more than 2 years ago already\nand become the basis for this paper.\n1.3. Notations and conventions\nab stands for the scalar product of a and b: ab \u2261 a0 b0 \u2212 a1 b1 \u2212 a2 b2 \u2212 a3 b3 = a0 b0 \u2212 ab; \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is a\ncompletely antisymmetric pseudotensor for which \u01eb0123 = 1. This metric signature requires appropriate\nsign in the definition of canonical momenta, in particular, p\u03bc = \u2212\u2202\u1e8b\u03bc L.\n2. The Cauchy problem for the fundamental relativistic rotator\nWe started off with a relativistically invariant action integral (1.3). To enable a manifestly covariant\ndescription obeying the constraint kk = 0 we need seven d.o.f, whereas only five d.o.f uniquely define\nthe physical state of a rotator. It would be aesthetically compelling to retain a covariant description, but we\nwant to focus on another aspect of the model in which the auxiliary d.o.f are unnecessary. We can eliminate\nthe d.o.f at the cost of loosing covariance of the description at the level of the equations of motion, but we\nknow our description is still relativistic in content.\nFrom now on we shall be assuming that all of the auxiliary d.o.f have been already eliminated\nfrom the action. That means that we are using a quintuple of coordinates on the configuration space\nR3 \u00d7 S2 and a fixed time variable. It is convenient to introduce the natural coordinates on R3 \u00d7 S2 ,\nq \u2261 {q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , q 4 , q 5 } = {x1 , x2 , x2 , \u03b8, \u03c6} in the gauge \u03c4 \u2261 x0 and k 0 \u2261 1. In effect we obtain some\nLagrangian defined on R3 \u00d7 S2 with the time variable being set to be the Newtonian time. Let such reduced\nLagrangian be denoted by LN (v, q), where q stands for the set of d.o.f on R3 \u00d7 S2 , and v \u2261 q\u0307 for the\nassociated velocities. Now, we can apply the elementary Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalism avoiding\nthe issue of constraints that would be necessary had we retained the auxiliary variables. Yet there is one\nreservation left. The necessary condition for the elementary Hamiltonian formulation is that the set of\nN\nequations p(v, q) = \u2202L\n\u2202v (q, v) defining momenta p conjugated to q be a diffeomorphism of the space of\nmomenta p and that of velocities v for all q. In other words, the set of equations should be uniquely solvable\nfor the velocities, v = v(q, p). It will be possible, provided the Hessian determinant is nonzero:\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n\u2202 LN\n6= 0.\n(2.1)\ndet\n\u2202 q\u0307 i \u2202 q\u0307 j\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n4\n\nOtherwise, the Legendre transformation leading from the Lagrangian LN (v, q) to the Hamiltonian would\nnot be well defined in terms of q and p. Moreover, for the Lagrangian equations can be recast in a general\nform\n\u2202 2 LN j\nq\u0308 = Zi (q, q\u0307, t),\n\u2202 q\u0307 i \u2202 q\u0307 j\nwith some function Z, condition (2.1) is also necessary for a unique dependence of accelerations q\u0308 on\npositions q and velocities q\u0307. The vanishing of the Hessian determinant would not only mean that q\u0308 would be\nnon-unique, but also that the Lagrangian equations could not be reduced to the canonical form \u1e8f = F (y, t),\nwhere y = {q, q\u0307}, for which the textbook results on the existence and uniqueness are known for solutions\nof ordinary differential equations. In particular, the Lagrangian equations could not be solved directly by\nmeans of the Picard method or a numerical step by step integration. A similar viewpoint on the necessity of\n(2.1) for internal coordinates is presented for Lagrangian systems in [11]. With a singular Lagrangian there\nwould be a gauge freedom or constraints in the system. Both situations would be physically unacceptable\nfor rotators with Lagrangians already expressed in terms of the internal coordinates on R3 \u00d7 S2 and a fixed\ntime variable.\n2.1. Characterization of fundamental relativistic rotators by Hessian singularity\nIn the natural coordinates on R3 \u00d7 S2 the Lagrangian LN corresponding to (1.1) reads\n\u221a\n\u1e45\u1e45\nLN = \u2212m 1 \u2212 \u1e8b\u1e8b f (Q),\nQ = l2\n, f \u2032 (Q) 6= 0, f (Q) > 0,\n(2.2)\n(1 \u2212 n\u1e8b)2\nq\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , x2 ), n = (sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, cos \u03b8) and |\u1e45| = \u03b8\u03072 + \u03c6\u03072 sin2 \u03b8.\nBy a Hessian assigned to the Lagrangian LN we mean a square (symmetric) matrix of second partial\nderivatives of LN with respect to velocities {\u1e8b1 , \u1e8b2 , \u1e8b2 , \u03b8\u0307, \u03c6\u0307}.

It is an f -dependent\nLorentz scalar uniquely determined by the structure of the model. The omitted proportionality factor is not\nof interest and may change depending on the particular coordinates used on R3 \u00d7 S2 .\nIt follows\npthat the\u221aonly nontrivial function f (Q) for which the Hessian determinant is identically zero\nis f (Q) = c1 1 + c2 Q. Here, c1 and c2 are some integration constants and they can be absorbed by the\ndimensional parameters m and l of the model. This gives us\nq\np\nf (Q) = 1 \u00b1 Q.\nHence, there are only two physically distinct Lagrangians with singular Hessian. Again, we arrive at action\n(1.3) obtained in Appendix A from fundamental conditions (1.2).\n2.2.

The identity (2.6) states that the system of Lagrangian equations for the Lagrangian (2.4) is\nlinearly dependent and therefore under-determined. Only four among five equations are independent. As a\nconsequence, there will be a single arbitrary function of the time present in the general solution.\nAs follows from the calculation in Appendix C, the most general solution to the equations of free\nmotion of the fundamental relativistic rotator in the gauge p\u1e8b = m and pk = m, has the following covariant\nparametric description:\nx\u03bc (t) =\n\nl\nP\u03bc\nt + r\u03bc (t) + x\u03bc (0),\nm\n2\n\nand k \u03bc (t) =\n\nwhere\nr\u03bc (t) = N \u03bc sin \u03c6(t) +\n\nP\u03bc\n\u1e59\u03bc (t)\n+p\n,\nm\n\u2212\u1e59(t)\u1e59(t)\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 N\u03bd W\u03b1 P\u03b2\ncos \u03c6(t).\n1 3\n2m l\n\nConstant vectors P \u03bc , W \u03bc and N \u03bc satisfy the conditions\n1\nW P = 0, N N = \u22121, N W = 0, N P = 0.\nP P = m2 , W W = \u2212 m4 l 2 ,\n4\nP \u03bc is the (conserved) momentum defining the time axis of the center of momentum frame (CM), t is the\nproper time in that frame, and W \u03bc is the (conserved) intrinsic angular momentum. Being the elliptic angle\nof a Lorentz operator, \u03c6 is a Lorentz scalar (see Appendix C). It describes the angular position of the image\nof the null direction k \u03bc (t) on a large circle lying on the Riemann sphere in the CM frame. The velocity of\nrotation relative to CM frame can be determined from the hyperbolic angle \u03a8 between timelike vectors P \u03bc\nP\nand \u1e8b\u03bc , \u1e8bP = |\u1e8b||P | cosh \u03a8. Since \u1e8b = m\n+ 2l \u1e59 by (2.7), we get |\u1e8b| cosh \u03a8 = \u1e8bP\nm = 1. In addition,\n2\nl\nl\n2\n2\n2\n\u1e8b\u1e8b = 1 + 4 \u1e59 and \u1e59 = \u2212\u03c6\u0307 ; hence, |\u1e8b| sinh \u03a8 = 2 | \u03c6\u0307|, which gives us the actual frequency of rotation\n\u03c6\u0307(t) in the CM frame\n2\n|\u03c6\u0307(t)| = tanh \u03a8,\n(2.8)\nl\nnumerically equal to a Lorentz scalar \u03a8 (rapidity). The Hamilton action (1.3) evaluated for the general\nsolution (2.7) reads\nZ\nl\n|\u03c6\u0307(t)| dt.\nS(t) = S(0) \u2212 m t \u2212 m\n2\nThe first term is the ordinary contribution from the inertial motion of the CM frame, growing linearly with t.\nThe second term contains the angle variable \u03c6 conjugate to the spin 12 ml. It does not grow linearly with t; it\nis left completely undetermined and can be arbitrary function of the time, such that 2l |\u03c6\u0307(t)| < 1. This upper\nbound by the velocity of light appears naturally in the solution since tanh \u03a8 < 1. The sign of \u03c6\u0307(t) should\nbe constant during motion. Otherwise, there would be discontinuities in k \u03bc (t), whereas the evolution of a\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n6\n\ndynamical system should be continuous (the part of k \u03bc orthogonal to P \u03bc inverts its direction whenever \u03c6\u0307(t)\npasses through 0). This limitation, however, is not naturally implied by the solution and must be imposed by\nhands, which is another trace of defectiveness of the Lagrangian (2.4). Had the rotator been a well-behaved\ndynamical system with non-singular Hessian, the \u03c6(t) would be a linear function of t and the flops in the\ndirection of k \u03bc would be impossible. The point \u03c6\u0307 (t) = 0 is a singularity of the equations of motion. It\nseparates two qualitatively different regimes of the motion: the inertial free motion on a straight line with\n\u03c6\u0307(t) \u2261 0 and the free motion on a circle of fixed radius l/2 (as perceived in the CM frame).\n3. The Hessian singularity and the issue of interactions with external fields.\nThe irregular Lagrangian (1.3) could be supplemented with an additive interaction term in the hope of\nremoving the free motion indeterminacy. However, even when the interaction was suitable for removing\nthe Hessian singularity for nonzero fields, the problem of indeterminate free motion would reoccur after\nswitching off the fields. The situation gets even worse when the Hessian singularity persists in the fields.\nThis can be seen in the example of electrically charged fundamental relativistic rotator minimally interacting\nwith electromagnetism. Even though the model is unphysical, considering it is still pedagogically instructive\nwhen contrasted with the motion of relativistic rotators with regular Lagrangian on R3 \u00d7 S2 for which such\nform of interaction is quite permissible.\n3.1. Relativistic rotators minimally coupled to external electromagnetic field\nIf a relativistic rotator was to be treated as a structureless point particle with electric charge e, it could be\nminimally coupled with the electromagnetic field. In principle, the internal structure of the rotator should\nk\u03bc k\u0307\u03bd\nalso be taken into account (through non-minimal terms involving gauge-invariant scalars such as F\u03bc\u03bd (k\n,\n\u1e8b)2\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd k k\u1e8b\u1e8b , etc.). The minimal interaction gives us the action integral of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\ne A\u1e8b\ne\nS = S + SI = \u2212m d\u03c4 \u1e8b\u1e8b f (Q) + \u221a\n, f \u2032 (Q) 6= 0, f (Q) > 0.\n(3.1)\nm \u1e8b\u1e8b\nThe resulting evolution law for the kinematical part of momentum is \u1e57\u03bc = eF\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bd . When projected onto\nthe direction of p\u03bc , it gives us the evolution law for p\u03bc p\u03bc :\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne\ne\n|\u1e8b|\n1 d p\u03bc p\u03bc\n= 2 F\u03bc\u03bd p\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = \u22122 Qf \u2032 (Q) F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd .\n(3.2)\n2 d\u03c4\nm2\nm\nm\nk \u1e8b\n\nIn general, the scalar p\u03bc p\u03bc will be variable for phenomenological rotators. For example, this would occur in\nconstant magnetic field for initial conditions chosen so as the velocity vector \u1e8b was not coplanar with vectors\nB and k. In order to have invariable p\u03bc p\u03bc during motion, one could try to look for solutions obeying the\ncondition F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0, or alternatively, F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc p\u03bd = 0. For fundamental rotators, however, p\u03bc p\u03bc is by\nconstruction a fixed parameter. Then F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0 is not a possibility but a constraint, an integrability\ncondition that must be imposed always for all solutions for consistency with the equations of motion, if only\none wants Q 6\u2261 0. A similar derivation of this constraint was presented in [8].\nLater, in section 3.2, we shall derive constraint F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0 for fundamental rotators rigorously based\non non-triviality of the Hessian null space on R3 \u00d7 S2 . But already the following observation shows that\nthis constraint is closely related to the Hessian singularity and is absent when the Hessian is not singular.\nNamely, by making use of the identity p\u03bc p\u03bc \u2261 m2 f (Q) (f (Q) \u2212 4Qf \u2032 (Q)), equation (3.2) can be written\nin the form involving a term with which we are familiar from the Hessian (2.3)\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u2032\ndQ\n2Q\ne F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd\nf (Q) f \u2032\u2032 (Q)\n+ \u2032\n=\n*\n,\n(3.3)\n1+2Q\nf (Q)\nf (Q)\nds\nf (Q) m\nk \u1e8b\n\u221a\nwhere ds = \u1e8b\u1e8b d\u03c4 . It follows that function Q will be constant for phenomenological rotators when\nF\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0. In that case, the actual value of the rotation velocity relative to the instantaneous CM frame,\nnumerically equal to\ntanh \u03a8 =\n\n2 Qf \u2032 (Q)\n,\nf (Q) \u2212 2Qf \u2032 (Q)\n\nwhere cosh \u03a8 =\n\np \u1e8b\n,\n|p||\u1e8b|\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n7\n\nwill also be constant. In particular, this would be the case in free motion. For arbitrary field, equation (3.2)\ncan be viewed as the evolution law for the instantaneous frequency of rotation relative to the CM frame.\nHowever, the situation is qualitatively different when the Hessian determinant (2.3) is identically vanishing.\nIn that case, as we have already seen in section 2.2, the frequency of rotation is not constant in free motion;\nit is indeterminate and can be an arbitrary function of the time (cf (2.8)). That is consistent with (3.3).\nFurthermore, in the presence of the electromagnetic field, if one does not want to have always Q = 0 as for\na point charge, one has to impose on solutions the constraint F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0, since then the left-hand side in\nequation (3.3) vanishes identically. Then, instead of the evolution law for Q admitting all initial conditions\nfor rotators with regular Lagrangians on R3 \u00d7 S2 , one is left with a constraint both for the motion and for\nthe initial conditions.\n3.2. Hessian constraint in the presence of the electromagnetic field\nIn section 3.1 we derived the constraint F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0 from the equations of motion for rotators described\nby the free action part (1.3) and we have seen from (3.3) that the appearance of the constraint must be related\nto the identical vanishing of the Hessian determinant on R3 \u00d7 S2 . Now, we shall derive the constraint in a\nway directly referring to the algebraic properties of the singular Hessian, by making use of its nontrivial null\nspace.\nTo this end we may confine ourselves to considering the particular parametrization as in (2.4) assuming\nthe + sign (for the \u2212 sign the results will be analogous). We remind that the fundamental relativistic rotator\nis not structureless; however, similarly as in (3.1) we assume for pedagogical reasons the minimal interaction\nwith the electromagnetic field. Then the Lagrangian (2.4) should be supplemented with the interaction term\nLI = \u2212eA\u1e8b = e \u1e8bA(x, t) \u2212 e \u03a6(x, t),\nwhere \u03a6 and A form the electromagnetic potential. The Hessian matrix (B.1) is not altered by this\ninteraction; thus, the Hessian determinant is still vanishing and the kernel vector w remains the same as\nin (2.5). By taking into account identity (2.6) which holds for the free Lagrangian part, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4LI\n\u03b4LI\n\u03b4LI\nl\nl\n|\u1e45| (n \u2212 \u1e8b)\n+ \u03c1 \u03b8\u0307\n+ \u03c6\u0307\n= \u2212e |\u1e45| (n \u2212 \u1e8b) (E + \u1e8b \u00d7 H) ,\n2\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4\u03b8\n\u03b4\u03c6\n2\n|\n{z\n}\n=0\n\nwhich leads to the following Hessian constraint when |\u1e45| 6= 0:\n(n \u2212 \u1e8b) (E + \u1e8b \u00d7 H) = 0\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nn (E + \u1e8b \u00d7 H) = \u1e8bE.\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\nComing back to the covariant notation, we obtain F\u03bc\u03bd k \u1e8b = 0 which is familiar from the previous\nparagraph. In contrast, for a nonsingular Hessian on R3 \u00d7 S2 the Hessian null space is trivial and the\nsame reasoning gives the identity 0 = 0. In that case any nontrivial linear combination of the equations of\nmotion would always result in some identities like (3.3), which are not constraints.\n3.3. Occurrence of unique solutions in external fields for irregular Lagrangians\nFree motion of a dynamical system with singular Hessian can be non-unique, described by arbitrary\nfunctions of the time. The non-uniqueness we obtained for fundamental rotators is real, since on the one hand\n\u03a8, the rapidity, is an observable and, on the other hand, it behaves as a gauge variable. It must not be so for a\nwell behaved dynamical system whose physical state must be unique. When an interaction term is added and\nthe singularity is not removed, new constraints may appear. We called them Hessian constraints. Although\nconstraints impose additional limitations on solutions, they are not sufficient to render the motion unique for\nall field configurations and initial conditions. A possible criterion to decide if a constraint consistent with\nthe Hessian constraint leads to a unique solution is to check if it excludes variations of velocities in the null\ndirection of the Hessian.\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n8\n\n3.3.1. An example. For the purpose of illustration, it will be instructive to consider the following nonrelativistic model of a point particle. Let its intrinsic structure be described in cylindrical coordinates r, \u03c6,\nz by the Lagrangian\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\nLo = 21 m \u1e592 + r2 \u03c6\u03072 + \u017c 2 + 81 ml2 \u03c8\u0307 2 \u2212 12 ml |\u03c8\u0307| \u1e59 cos (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) + r\u03c6\u0307 sin (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) .\n\nThe fourth coordinate \u03c8 refers to some internal rotational degree of freedom of the particle. Alternatively,\none can regard this Lagrangian as describing a structureless point particle living in a four-dimensional\nhyper-cylinder R3 \u00d7 S1 with the fourth dimension \u03c8 being curled up into a tiny circle of radius 12 l,\nand moving in a complicated velocity-dependent field. The Hessian is singular. Its only kernel vector\nis w = r cos (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2202r + sin (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2202\u03c6 + 2r\u01eb\nl \u2202\u03c8 , \u01eb = sgn(\u03c8\u0307). The associated Hessian constraint is\no\nwi \u03b4L\n\u2261\n0.\nIt\nvanishes\nidentically\n(not\nonly\nfor solutions). Hence, the equations of motion are not\n\u03b4qi\nindependent, similarly as for the Lagrangian (2.4) and the motion is non-unique. In particular, there is a\nsolution r = 2l , \u03c6 = \u03bd(t), z = 0, \u03c8 = \u03bd(t) + \u01eb \u03c02 , with an arbitrary function \u03bd(t). Solutions with various \u03bd\nand satisfying the same initial conditions are indistinguishable based on the least action principle.\nWhat the presence of interactions would change? In the field of the electric type VE = Kz, the Hessian\nE\nconstraint is still trivial since wi \u03b4V\n\u03b4qi = 0 and \u03bd(t) is still non-unique, with the only difference that the center\n1\n2\nof mass accelerates along the z axis, z\u0308 = \u2212 K\nm . In the field of the magnetic type, V = 2 K\u0303r \u03c6\u0307, the Hessian\nconstraint is nontrivial for nonzero K\u0303 r\u03c6\u0307 cos (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u1e59 sin (\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) = 0. Here, we mention only some\nK\u0303R\nfixed frequency solutions that are unique: a) \u03c6 = \u03c9t, \u03c8 = \u03c9t \u2212 \u03c02 , \u03c9 = m(R+l/2)\nfor R > 0; b) \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c9t,\n\nK\u0303R\nK\u0303R\nfor R < l/2; and c) \u03c6 = \u03c9t, \u03c8 = \u03c9t + \u03c02 , \u03c9 = m(R\u2212l/2)\nfor R > l/2,\n\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c02 , \u03c9 = m(l/2\u2212R)\nwhere, for all these solutions, z = 0 and r = R > 0 (all constants assumed positive).\nIt is clear from this example that the addition interactions cannot restore uniqueness in all cases. To\nmake the motion always unique in an arbitrary field, the Hessian must be nonsingular \u2013 it would suffice to\nchange a little the 1/2 factor standing in front of the second term in the Lagrangian Lo to achieve this (then\nno Hessian constraint would appear).\n\n3.3.2. Occurrence of unique solutions for charged fundamental rotator. Uniform magnetic field. We have\nseen above that solutions may occasionally occur to be unique in the presence of external fields despite\nHessian singularity. A similar behavior should be expected for the fundamental rotator. An example of such\nmotion was found in the uniform magnetic field in [8] but the reason for its uniqueness was left unexplained,\nhowever. There is also an apparent contradiction that should be explained: these motions are unique for the\narbitrarily small magnetic field, whereas the free motion is not unique. Paradoxically, the Hessian singularity\nwill play a central role in understanding this uniqueness issue.\nIn free motion of the fundamental rotator, vectors n and \u1e8b are co-rotating in the CM frame, i.e.\nn \u00d7 \u1e8b = 0, and the motion is circular in that frame. Co-rotation is also trivially consistent with the\ncondition H (n \u00d7 \u1e8b) = 0 to which the Hessian constraint (3.4) reduces in the presence of pure magnetic\nfield in some reference frame. Recall, that the motion of a point charge is circular in the plane perpendicular\nto H, has fixed rotational frequency and becomes inertial in the limit |H| \u2192 0 when the frequency tends to\n0. By this analogy one can expect the frequency to be fixed also for the fundamental rotator in co-rotational\ncircular motion in the plane perpendicular to H.\nTo discuss the particular motions it will be useful to work in cylindrical coordinates with the z axis\ndirected along H: H = [0, 0, H], H > 0. For co-rotational motion with frequency \u03c6\u0307 about a circle of fixed\nradius R, \u1e8b = \u01eb R \u03c6\u0307 n, where \u01eb = \u00b11; hence, Hn = 0 since \u1e8bH = 0. Thus, the co-rotation ansatz is\na stronger limitation than the Hessian constraint alone, and it should not astonish that a solution obeying it\nmay turn out unique. In particular, for \u01eb = 1 and e > 0 we get a solution with |\u1e8b| < 1 when \u03c6\u0307 = \u03c6\u0307\u00b1 , where\nr\n\u0010 m \u00112\n2R\n2 \u22121\n1\u2213\n\u03bc\u00b1 = 1 +\n\u2212 1 > 0.\n\u03c6\u0307\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 ,\nl\neHR\nl\nThe corresponding Hessian kernel vector reads w =\nl\n2 |\u03c6\u0307|).\n\nl\n2\n\n|\u03c6\u0307 |(1 \u2212 R \u01eb \u03c6\u0307) n\u2202x \u2295 \u033a \u03c6\u0307 \u2202\u03c6 with \u033a =\n\n1\u2212R\u01eb\u03c6\u0307\n(1\n1+R\u01eb\u03c6\u0307\n\n+\n\nTo understand why the frequency is fixed, suppose that a variation \u03b4 q\u0307 could be made collinear with w\nfor the solutions (in which case arbitrary acceleration of the rotation frequency could be possible).

On the other hand,\nthe corresponding variation of the Hessian constraint H (n \u00d7 \u1e8b) = 0 gives H (\u2212\u1e8b \u00d7 \u03b4n + n \u00d7 \u03b4 \u1e8b) = 0,\ni.e., H (n \u00d7 \u03b4n) = 0 for co-rotation, or in coordinates and evaluated at the solutions, |H| \u03b4\u03c6 = 0. Hence,\n\u03b4\u03c6 = 0, which means that \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 = 0, a contradiction with the assumed collinearity of \u03b4 q\u0307 and w for \u03c6\u0307 6\u2261 0.\nThis means that the particular solutions must have fixed frequency, as expected. There is also another way\nof seeing why the frequency is fixed. Suppose that the frequency has been altered at some instant for a short\nperiod of time, \u03c6\u0307 \u2192 \u03c6\u0307 + \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307, without changing positions and other velocities. The corresponding change\nin the velocity would be \u03b4 \u1e8b = \u01eb R n \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 and the corresponding 'acceleration' \u03b4 q\u0307 would be proportional to\na = \u01ebR \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 n\u2202x \u2295 \u03b4 \u03c6\u0307 \u2202\u03c6 . Then, a and w could be collinear only when R = 2l and \u01eb = \u03c6\u0307/|\u03c6\u0307|, in which case\n\u1e8b = 2l |\u03c6\u0307|n \u2013 a condition satisfied in the free motion (compare with solution (2.7)). This cannot be satisfied\nwhen |H| 6= 0 which is evident from the explicit solutions. When l \u2192 0, \u03c6\u0307\u2212 reduces to the cyclotron\nfrequency and when H \u2192 \u221e the frequency tends to \u2212R\u22121 \u2013 a motion with the velocity of light. It is\nimportant to see that \u03c6\u0307\u2212 tends to 0 as H \u2192 0 (or e \u2192 0) in which limit one recovers the inertial motion,\nnot the rotational motion (2.7). Another solution for e > 0 has positive frequency (opposite to that expected\nfor a positive charge in this field) and the velocity lower than that of light: \u03c6\u0307 = \u03c6\u0307+ . In particular, these\nassumptions are not satisfied in a region containing l/2, making R = l/2 impossible. The indeterminate\nfrequency solution (2.7) is again not attainable in the limit H \u2192 0 (or e \u2192 0) even though the condition\n\u1e8bn = R |\u03c6\u0307| > 0 is now satisfied.\nIt should be stressed that the considered motion in uniform magnetic field is qualitatively different\nfrom the free motion (2.7). The free model is not a simple limit of the interacting model when e tends to\n0 \u2013 to connect both the situations in some abstract solution manifold one has to cross the inertial motion\nbarrier \u03c6\u0307 \u2261 0 which in a sense is singular. For example, there is a circular motion in magnetic field for\nwhich \u1e8bn = \u2212 2l |\u03c6\u0307| < 0 when R = 2l , while this inequality is impossible in free circular motion when\n\u1e8bn \u2261 + 2l |\u03c6\u0307| > 0.\n3.4. Remarks on physical inviability of the Hessian constraint F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0\nIn empty space there are two qualitatively different motions possible for the fundamental rotator: the inertial\nmotion (with zero frequency) and the rotational motion (with indeterminate frequency). The two situations\nare qualitatively distinct. Accordingly, in the presence of fields, one should expect two branches of solutions\nthat in the limit of vanishing fields pass over to two limiting solutions: one is the inertial motion and the\nother is the free indeterminate rotational motion (we observed this in our example 3.3.1).\nWe have seen already in section 3.3.1 that other models with similar Hessian singularity do have\nindeterminate solutions in the presence of external fields and that the Hessian constraint is not sufficient to\nmake those solutions unique at all. The same conclusion were arrived at in [12] where non-unique Hessian\nconstrained solutions were presented in the electromagnetic field for a possible Newtonian counterpart of the\nfundamental rotator. This nonuniqueness feature of singular Lagrangians is clear. Recall, that accelerations\nfor the internal d.o.f are not unique when the Hessian is singular. The higher derivatives are thus not uniquely\ndeterminable from the lower derivatives by the equations of motion and their derivatives, and additional\nconditions are required to remove this indeterminacy. The Hessian constraints (which play the role of\nintegrability condition of the equations) and their derivatives are not sufficient for entire removal of this\nindeterminacy, except for particular solutions with high symmetry.\nIt is justified to put forward a conjecture that also for the charged fundamental rotator the solutions\nobeying the Hessian constrained F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0 will not be unique for general fields. This could be proved by\ntrying to find some solutions by means of a series expansion method and to see that for generic fields not all\nexpansion coefficients could be determined from the permissible initial data. It is evident that the occurrence\nof unique solutions is not in contradiction with Hessian singularity. As we have seen in section 3.3.2, under\ncertain conditions velocities cannot be varied along the direction of the Hessian kernel vector. The presented\nsolutions in uniform magnetic field were found assuming co-rotational motion. Co-rotation is a trivial\nsolution of the Hessian constraint, nonetheless it turned out to be very restrictive. In conjunction with the\nplanar motion it allowed only for variations in the subspace orthogonal to the kernel of the singular Hessian.\nIn that case the permissible variations increase the value of the action functional so that the extremals on a\nconstraint surface become unique. Another possibility of showing that Hessian constrained solutions may\nbe non-unique would be to find an example of the indeterminate solution. Unfortunately, the constrained\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n10\n\nequations for the fundamental rotator in electromagnetic field are too complicated to explicitly show the\nbranch of non-unique solutions. Nevertheless, we could observe such solutions in a simpler setup in section\n3.3.1 and this should be convincing enough. Also in [11] a similar argumentation for non-uniqueness of\nsimilarly constrained solutions is presented that can be summarized as follows: constraints such as (3.4)\nare a limitation on the possible initial conditions, and a unique solution cannot be fixed in general, even\nby selecting initial data permissible by the constraints (this statement was also illustrated with the help of\nan example even simpler than that we presented in section 3.3.1). But this theoretical issue seems only\nsecondary in our context \u2013 there is more important argumentation addressing physical inviability of the\ncharged fundamental rotator.\nConstraint (3.4) requires that for consistency of the equations of motion with the Hessian singularity,\nthe vector n \u2212 \u1e8b must be always perpendicular to the actual direction of the Lorentz force. The magnitude\nof this force is completely irrelevant, it could be even infinitesimal. Thus, the constraint is not dynamical,\nand it is not a force. The constraint is in conflict with the symmetries of space \u2013 not all initial conditions\nadmissible for the rotator in free motion are allowed in the presence of electromagnetic field (for example,\nif initially \u1e8b = 0, then the initial direction n could not be chosen arbitrary but should be perpendicular to\nthe electric field, even for infinitesimally weak field). This never happens for known particles with spin for\nwhich the initial data such as the position, orientation in space and velocities, can be arbitrary both in the\npresence and absence of external fields. The limitation on velocities and positions persists for the charged\nfundamental rotator even in the presence of the infinitely weak field, whereas there is nothing preferable\nfor positions and directions in the configuration space R3 \u00d7 S2 and the corresponding tangent space which\nboth are totally symmetric. Furthermore, in order to satisfy constraint (3.4), the fundamental rotator should\nbe instantaneously following variations in the field irrespectively of its intensity and frequency, even for\narbitrarily large mass and spin of the rotator. Surely, the presence of the electromagnetic field cannot be\nblamed for these paradoxes \u2013 the motion of all other electrically charged rotators with regular Lagrangians\non R3 \u00d7 S2 is not constrained in the electromagnetic field and the initial conditions can be arbitrary, in\nagreement with the symmetries of R3 \u00d7 S2 (then the acceleration term is not removed from equations such\nas (3.2) and no constraint appears).\n4. Summary and concluding remarks\nAt a given instance of time in an inertial reference frame the physical state of a relativistic rotator is uniquely\ndefined by specifying position and the associated velocities in a five-dimensional physical configuration\nspace identical to R3 \u00d7 S2 . We found it essential that the Lagrangian expressed in terms of the d.o.f on\nR3 \u00d7 S2 should be regular, i.e. the associated Hessian should be nonsingular.\nOf particular interest is considering fundamental rotators. Their Casimir mass and spin are fixed\nparameters. There are two fundamental rotators. All the other rotators are called phenomenological and\ntheir mass is some function of the spin.\nThe main result of this work is to show that fundamental rotators can be characterized by singularity of\nthe Hessian. Despite fundamental rotators were extensively studied in the literature this serious defect has\nnot been recognized. On account of this singularity the accelerations cannot be uniquely determined from\nthe initial state, which results in some nonuniqueness in the motion. We have found in a covariant way the\ngeneral solution and identified the indeterminate degree of freedom. The associated velocity has the physical\ninterpretation of the frequency of a circular motion in the CM frame. It can be an arbitrary function of the\ntime \u2013 a property characteristic of systems with gauge freedom. A physical state cannot depend on gauge\nvariables. To remove this paradox we conclude that fundamental rotators interpreted as genuine rotators\nare defective as dynamical systems. In contrast, the equations of motion of phenomenological rotators are\ndeterminate.\nThe Hessian singularity of fundamental rotators says that the necessary condition for the invertibility\nof the equations defining momenta is broken and the Lagrangian description on R3 \u00d7 S2 cannot be\nunambiguously transformed to a Hamiltonian description with a definite dynamics on R3 \u00d7 S2 since there\nare no nontrivial constraints. The absence of constraints follows from our construction of the Hessian null\nspace. We showed that the system of equations of motion on R3 \u00d7 S2 is under-determinate, only four\nequations are linearly independent. This explains the presence of the arbitrary function of the time in the\ngeneral solution. Our analysis at the Lagrangian level has been recently confirmed at the Hamiltonian level\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n11\n\nin [12] where a minimal Hamiltonian was presented based on the Dirac formalism for the whole family of\nrelativistic rotators and where the Hamiltonian equations of motion were solved both for fundamental and\nphenomenological rotators. The Hamiltonian picture gives the same indeterminate motion for fundamental\nrotators. A comment on this is appropriate here. As already noted, fundamental rotators are equivalent at\nthe Lagrangian level to a geometric spinning particle model suggested in [1]. A Hamiltonian formulation\npresented therein become the basis for a quantization of this system. However, the authors did not refer\nto any nonuniqueness. As follows from [12] a unique motion at the Hamiltonian level is possible only for\nphenomenological rotators. To remove this discrepancy, recall that for a given initial data the mass and spin\nof phenomenological rotators are constants of motion \u2013 their Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian vanish\nand therefore the mass and spin can be regarded as fixed at the Hamiltonian level and effectively put as\nconstants into the Hamiltonian (although one should remember that then the mass is a function of the spin\nand both depend on the initial conditions). In this sense the Hamiltonian found in [1] should be reinterpreted\nas that for phenomenological rotators since it cannot be correct for fundamental rotators with indeterminate\nmotion at the Lagrangian level. To correctly describe a fundamental rotator at the Hamiltonian level, an\nadditional constraint should be included in the Hamiltonian that would commute with other constraints of\nreparametrization and projection invariance (the latter two are the only constraints assumed in [1]). Then\na non-unique solution could be obtained at the Hamiltonian level equivalent to that found for fundamental\nrotators at the Lagrangian level (and this program has been realized in [12]). The conclusion is that the\nquantum mechanics found in [1] is that for phenomenological rotators rather than that for fundamental\nrotators.\nOur results bring up an interesting general question about the existence of non-degenerate classical\nfundamental systems, that is, without the analogous Hessian singularity for the physical d.o.f. This offers\nus a new field of interesting investigations. The most important in this context is to construct a comparably\nsimple relativistic dynamical system which would be both fundamental and non-degenerate. Then one could\nfind unambiguously the equivalent Hamiltonian description with a definite dynamics and obtain its quantum\nmechanical version corresponding to the classical Lagrangian level.\nThe Hessian degeneracy of fundamental rotators could be removed by introducing an interaction term\nwith suitable nonlinearities in velocities. However, even then there would still persist the problem of nonuniqueness of free motion. We addressed the issue of interaction in a more detail. We showed that an\ninteraction term linear in the velocities cannot remove the Hessian degeneracy, in particular this degeneracy\nis not removed by the minimal coupling with the electromagnetic field. In general, when the singularity\nis not removed, Hessian constraints must appear which involve positions and velocities. The number of\nsuch constraints equals the dimensionality of the Hessian's null space. In particular, for the Lagrangian of\nfundamental rotators on R3 \u00d7 S2 a single constraint for admissible motions appears. In the free motion this\nconstraint is trivial showing linear dependence of the equations of free motion. For the minimal coupling of\nfundamental rotators with the electromagnetic field the constraint is nontrivial and reads F\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0. We\ngave arguments that this constraint is physically unviable. For the similar form of interaction no constraint\nis present for phenomenological rotators and their motion is unique.\nIt might be expected that the presence of a constraint could make solutions unique. This is not the\ncase. In a simple example of a point particle with singular Hessian we illustrated that there can be solutions\nwhich are still non-unique. Occasionally, unique motions are nevertheless possible in external fields. We\nillustrated the mechanism of appearance of such unique solutions by considering a co-rotational motion of\nthe fundamental relativistic rotator in the uniform magnetic field.\nIt is worth mentioning that the fundamental relativistic rotator is not an isolated example when imposing\nfundamental conditions goes hand by hand with the Hessian singularity. Recently, an extended class of\nrotators was studied in which fundamental systems also proved similarly defective [7]. One of the systems\nturned out equivalent to a universal spinning particle model considered many years ago by Lyakhovich,\nSegal and Sharapov [13].\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge Professor Andrzej Staruszkiewicz for his always invaluable and stimulating\ndiscussions.\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator.

The null space of the Hessian of the fundamental relativistic rotator\nLet denote a 5-component kernel vector from this space by w. Vector w can be regarded as a direct sum of\ntwo vectors of dimension 2 (associated with the angular variables) and of dimension 3 (associated with the\nposition variables). Since matrices A, B and C were constructed using vectors W , N and V , the vector w\ncan be supposed to be represented as a column vector, w = [\u03b1W T , \u03b2N T + \u03b3V T ]T , with unknowns \u03b1, \u03b2,\n\u03b3. This is an ansatz for the vector w. A kernel vector of the Hessian matrix (B.1) must satisfy two vector\nequations \u03b1AW + \u03b2BN + \u03b3BV = 0 and \u03b1B T W + \u03b2CN + \u03b3CV = 0.

Construction of solutions for the fundamental relativistic rotator\nIn this section we find a covariant form of solutions to the equations of motion resulting from the Hamilton\naction (1.3).

A convenient way\nof deriving the equation of motion for k \u03bc , without the need of introducing the internal coordinates on\nthe cone kk = 0, is to find a conditional extremum of functional (1.3) subject to the condition kk = 0.\nThis is a standard variational problem with subsidiary conditions [14] \u2013 the stationary value of functional\n(1.3)\nwith the condition kk = 0, can be found by supplementing the functional with an additional term\nR\nd\u03c4 (\u2212)\u039b(\u03c4 )kk, containing a Lagrange multiplier \u039b(\u03c4 ). By varying such extended action with respect to\n\u039b, one restores the condition kk = 0, whereas the variation with respect to vector k \u03bc , yields the following\nequation: \u03c0\u0307\u03bc + \u2202k\u03bc L \u2212 2\u039bk\u03bc = 0. By contracting it with vector p\u03bc , one finds the unknown function \u039b(\u03c4 ),\nand hence, the equation of motion for k\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u2202L\np\u03bd k\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03c0\u0307\u03bd + \u03bd\n= 0,\nkk = 0.\n(C.2)\n\u03b4 \u03bc\u2212\n\u2202k\npk\nThis equation can be recast in a form having \u0001a very clear geometrical meaning. Firstly, a null vector k \u03bc can\nalways be written as k \u03bc = h m\u22121 p\u03bc + n\u03bc , where n\u03bc is a unit space-like vector orthogonal to timelike\nvector p\u03bc , and h = m\u22121 p\u03bc k\u03bc . Secondly, for describing a space-like curve n\u03bc (\u03c4 ), it is more natural to\nregard its arc length\nZ\n\u221a\nnn = \u22121, np = 0,\n\u03c6 (\u03c4 ) = d\u03c4 \u2212\u1e45\u1e45,\n\nas the independent variable, rather than any other. Furthermore, the momentum p\u03bc is conserved, p\u03bc (\u03c4 ) =\nP \u03bc , where P \u03bc is a constant vector such that P P = m2 . Now, making use of these observations, equation\n(C.2) can be reduced (up to unimportant h-dependent factor) to the following equation for n\u03bc :\nd2 n\u03bc\n+ n\u03bc = 0,\nnn = \u22121, nP = 0.\n(C.3)\nd\u03c62\nThis is nothing but the equation for great circles on a unit sphere in the subspace orthogonal to P \u03bc (then\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) is the angle). Expressed in terms of n\u03bc (\u03c6), the Pauli-Luba\u0144ski spin-vector reads\nW\u03bc =\n\n1\ndn\u03b2\nml\u01eb\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 n\u03b1\nP\u03b3 .\n2\nd\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\nThis constant pseudo-vector is orthogonal to the plane spanned by n\u03bc and dn\nd\u03c6 ; thus, together with P , it\ncan be used to construct solutions.\nA parametric description of a specific circle from the family of solutions can be visualized as a\ncontinuous action of an elliptic Lorentz transformation upon some fixed unit spatial vector \u0010N \u03bc orthogonal\n\u0011\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nto W \u03bc and P \u03bc . Such a transformation must leave invariant two null directions K\u00b1\n= \u221a12 Pm \u00b1 1W\n.\n2\n2m l\n\u03bc\nParameterized by the elliptic angle \u03c6, the general solution for n (\u03c6) is thus easily found to be\n\nn\u03bc (\u03c6) = N \u03bc cos \u03c6 \u2212\n\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 N\u03bd W\u03b1 P\u03b2\nsin \u03c6,\n1 3\n2m l\n\nN N = \u22121,\n\nN W = 0,\n\nN P = 0.\n\nThis is indeed the general solution to equation (C.3). As was to be anticipated from the independence of\nHamilton's action (1.3) upon scaling of the null vector k by arbitrary function, there is no constraint imposed\non function h by the equations of motion, thus, without loss of generality, one may set h \u2261 1. Finally, the\ncorresponding null direction and spacetime position can be found from\nP\u03bc\n,\nm\n\n\u1e8b\u03bc\nP\u03bc\n\u221a\n=\n* cosh \u03a8 (\u03c4 ) + n\u03bc (\u03c6(\u03c4 )) * sinh \u03a8 (\u03c4 ).\n(C.4)\nm\n\u1e8b\u1e8b\nThe second equation in (C.4) comes from the Noether integral (C.1). Since the parameter \u03c4 is arbitrary, one\nmay fix it by requiring that \u1e45\u1e45 = \u22121, in which case \u03c6(\u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03c4 , or alternatively that P \u1e8b \u2261 m, in which case\n\u03c4 would be the proper time in the CM frame.\nFunction \u03a8 is a reparametrization invariant Lorentz scalar, e.g. tanh (\u03a8 (\u03c4 )) = \u2212m Pn\u1e8b\u1e8b . It can equally\nwell be regarded as a function of \u03c6 by fixing the arbitrary parameter \u03c4 , so as \u03c4 \u2261 \u03c6. The equations of motion,\nexpressed in terms of the independent variable \u03c6, are satisfied by any \u03a8(\u03c6). Then, as is seen from (C.4), k \u03bc\n\u03bc\nis a definite function of the angle \u03c6, whereas the 4-velocity u\u03bc = \u221a\u1e8b\u1e8b\u1e8b is not: un = \u2212 sinh (\u03a8 (\u03c6)). This\nk \u03bc = n\u03bc (\u03c6(\u03c4 )) +\n\n\f\u0141ukasz Bratek,\n\nFundamental Relativistic Rotator. Hessian singularity. . . (preprint)\n\n16\n\ncannot happen for a well-behaved dynamical system, in which situation, after fixing \u03c4 the same way, one\nwould expect to obtain a definite function \u03a8(\u03c6), being constant for a uniform rotation.\nIt is rather upsetting to find out that, after fixing the parametrization, say by requiring that P \u1e8b \u2261 m,\nsolution (C.4) remains completely undetermined by the initial conditions. This observation was the main\nmotivation for this paper as it shows that the fundamental relativistic rotator is defective as a dynamical\nsystem. The reason for this arbitrariness is explained in section 2.\nThe auxiliary function \u03a8 defined in (C.1) allows not only for concise notation, but it also has a\ndefinite meaning. Namely, \u03a8 is the hyperbolic angle between the momentum p\u03bc and the world-velocity\nu\u03bc , pu = m cosh \u03a8. It is related to the time dependence of rotation\nof the null direction in the CM frame.\n\u0001\nThe proper time in this frame increases by dt = m\u22121 P\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bc d\u03c4 with every infinitesimal displacement\n\u221a\ndx\u03bc = \u1e8b\u03bc d\u03c4 of the rotator. It follows from equation\n(C.4) that \u1e8b\u1e8b sinh \u03a8 = \u2212n\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bc and, in conjunction\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith the definition of \u03a8 in equation (C.1), 2 \u1e8b\u1e8b sinh \u03a8d\u03c4 = l \u2212\u1e45\u1e45 d\u03c4 \u2261 l |\u03c6\u0307| d\u03c4 , where \u03c6\u0307 d\u03c4 is the\ncorresponding change in the angular position of the null direction, observed in this frame. Hence, the\nangular speed of the null direction in the CM frame is\n2\nd\u03c6\n2\n2 n\u03bc u \u03bc\n= tanh \u03a8 <\n= \u2212 * P\u03bc\n\u03bc\ndt\nl\nl\nl\nmu\nin agrement with the relation between the frequency and the rotational speed (tanh \u03a8) on a circular orbit of\nradius l/2.\nd\n).\nTo solve equation (C.4) for x, we choose the arbitrary parameter\n\u03c4 so that \u03c4 \u2261 t (hereafter  \u0307 \u2261 dt\n\u0001 \u03bc\n\u22121\nNow, on account of the earlier definition of t, dt = m P\u03bc \u1e8b d\u03c4 , one has P \u1e8b \u2261 m, or equivalently,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22121/2\ncosh \u03a8 = (\u1e8b\u1e8b)\n. Hence, \u1e8b\u03bc dt = Pm dt + n\u03bc tanh \u03a8 dt = Pm dt + 2l n\u03bc d\u03c6, and finally, integration gives\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nx\u03bc (t).
