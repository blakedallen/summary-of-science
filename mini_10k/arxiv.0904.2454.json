Postal 508, 58051-900 Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil\n(Dated: November 2, 2018)\nProperties of random and fluctuating systems are often studied through the use of Gaussian\ndistributions. However, in a number of situations, rare events have drastic consequences, which\ncan not be explained by Gaussian statistics. Considerable efforts have thus been devoted to the\nstudy of non Gaussian fluctuations such as L\u00e9vy statistics, generalizing the standard description of\nrandom walks. Unfortunately only macroscopic signatures, obtained by averaging over many random\nsteps, are usually observed in physical systems. We present experimental results investigating the\nelementary process of anomalous diffusion of photons in hot atomic vapours. We measure the step\nsize distribution of the random walk and show that it follows a power law characteristic of L\u00e9vy\nflights.\n\nRandom walk of particles in a disordered or fluctuating\nmedium is often well described by a diffusion equation,\ncharacterized by a linear increase in time of the mean\nsquare displacement of the particles: < r2 >= Dt, with\nD the diffusion coefficient. One assumption for the diffusion equation to hold is that the size x of each step of\nthe random walk is given by a distribution P (x) with a\nfinite second moment < x2 >, allowing to apply the central limit theorem. When the step size distribution P (x)\nfollows an asymptotic power law P (x) \u223c 1/x\u03b1 , the moments of the distributions can however become infinite.\nIt has been long established that for \u03b1 < 3, the average square displacement is governed by rare but large\nsteps [1]. Such a class of random walk is called L\u00e9vy\nflights, corresponding to a superdiffusive behaviour where\n< r2 >= Dt\u03b3 , with \u03b3 > 1. The broad range of applications of L\u00e9vy flights includes biology, economics, finance,\ncatastrophe management and resonance fluorescence in\nastrophysical systems and atomic vapours [2, 3, 4, 5].\nLarge (non Gaussian) fluctuations also play a fundamental role in many physical situations, in particular around\nphase transitions, having triggered considerable efforts to\nunderstand universal features of such phenomena [6, 7].\nAnomalous transport of photons has been reported recently in engineered optical material [8]. Superdiffusive\nbehavior of light has also been known in the context of radiation trapping in hot atomic vapors. Because this phenomenon occurs in many different systems, ranging from\nstars [9] to dense atomic vapours [10] such as gas lasers,\ndischarges and hot plasmas, this field has been subject\nto intense studies for many decades, including seminal\nwork by Holstein [11]. It has been realized very early\n[12] that frequency redistribution has a profound impact\non the multiple scattering features of light. Whereas elastic scattering, which occurs in laser-cooled dilute atomic\nvapours [13, 14, 15], leads to normal diffusion with well\ndefined scattering mean free path and diffusion coeffi-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Robin.Kaiser@inln.cnrs.fr\n\ncient, inelastic scattering as in hot vapours can lead to\nsituations where the central limit theorem no longer applies and photon trajectories are expected to be L\u00e9vy\nflights. Unfortunately, in most systems where multiple\nscattering of light occurs, it is difficult to have direct experimental access to the single step size distribution at\nthe origin of the random walk and anomalous diffusion is\nusually inferred from macroscopic observations [8, 10].\nIn this Article we present experimental results investigating the microscopic ingredient leading to a regime\nof superdiffusion in the multiple scattering of light in\nhot vapours of rubidium atoms. We have used a specific geometrical arrangement to isolate a single step in\nthe multiple scattering sequence. We measure the single\nstep size distribution P (x), which follows a power law\nP (x) \u221d 1/x\u03b1 , with \u03b1 < 3. Therefore the photon trajectories are L\u00e9vy flights, with an infinite variance of P (x).\nThe random walk of light in atomic vapours is usually characterized by the various moments of the step\nsize distribution P (x).\nR \u221e One can define a mean free\npath by l = hxi = 0 xP (x)dx and a diffusion coefficient from the variance \u03c3x2 of the distribution. For photons at frequency \u03c9, this step size distribution P (x, \u03c9)\n(x,\u03c9)\n, where T is the\nis deduced from P (x, \u03c9) = \u2212 \u2202T \u2202x\nforward transmission given by the Beer-Lambert's law\nT (x, \u03c9) = e\u2212x/l(\u03c9) , with the frequency dependant mean\nfree path l(\u03c9). This results in an exponential distribution\nP (x, \u03c9) =\n\n1 \u2212x/l(\u03c9)\ne\n.\nl(\u03c9)\n\n(1)\n\nWhile these considerations give a good description for\natoms close to zero temperature [13, 14, 15], most samples in and outside laboratories present a Doppler broadening \u2206\u03c9D much larger than the natural linewidth \u0393 of\nthe optical transition. The normalized spectrum \u0398(\u03c9) of\nthe light in the multiple scattering regime then influences\nthe properties of its random walk [12]. For instance photons with a frequency in the wings of the absorption line\nwill travel over a much larger distance than photons at\nthe center of the absorption line. The step size distribution P (x) is obtained by a frequency average of P (x, \u03c9)\n\n\f2\n[Eq. (1)] weighted by the spectrum \u0398(\u03c9):\nZ +\u221e\n1 \u2212x/l(\u03c9)\n\u0398(\u03c9) \u00d7\nP (x) =\ne\nd\u03c9 .\nl(\u03c9)\n0\n\nSource cell\n\n(2)\n\nThe subsequent single step size distribution of light in an\natomic vapour can be numerically computed given the\nknowledge of the emission spectrum \u0398(\u03c9) and of the absorption spectrum 1/l(\u03c9) (see the Methods section). An\nanalytical expression can be obtained in some limiting\ncases. For instance, assuming that the emission and absorption spectra are purely Gaussian (as given by pure\nDoppler broadening and neglecting the atomic natural\nLorentzian absorption line), then the single step size distribution asymptotically follows [11, 16]:\nP (x) \u223c\n\nx2\n\n1\np\n,\nln(x/l0 )\n\nObservation cell\n\n(3)\n\nwhere l\u22121\n= nat \u03c30 with nat the atomic density and \u03c30\n0\nthe scattering cross section at the atomic resonance. This\nheavy tail distribution leads to L\u00e9vy flights of light. As\nexplained above, the underlying mechanism of this power\nlaw is a frequency average of the Beer-Lambert transmission, as different frequency components are not scattered\nafter the same distance.\nTo measure this step size distribution, we have used\na specific multicell arrangement as shown in Fig. 1. We\nimage on a cooled charge coupled camera (CCD) the fluorescence of a natural isotopic mixture of rubidium atoms\nin a long cylindrical observation cell, illuminated along\nits axis. We thus measure the probability of a photon\nto be scattered after a distance x along the cell axis, i.e.\nthe step size distribution P (x).\nAs a reference, we first measure P (x) in the case when\nthe observation cell is illuminated by a monochromatic\nincident laser, locked to the F = 3 \u2192 F \u2032 = 4 transition\nof the D2 line of rubidium 85. From the corresponding\nimage [Fig. 2(a)] we extract an exponential step size distribution as expected from Beer-Lambert's law [Eq. (1)\n& Fig. 3]. This preliminary measurement allows the calibration of the mean free path for resonant light and thus\nthe atomic density, which can be varied by adjusting the\ntemperature of the observation cell from 20\u25e6 C to about\n47\u25e6 C. The atomic density thus varies from 9 \u00d7 1015 to\n2 \u00d7 1017 m\u22123 , and the mean free path changes accordingly from 50 mm to 5 mm.\nTo measure L\u00e9vy flights of light we use a double cell\nconfiguration [Fig. 1]. Our 11 mW, 2 mm-waist laser\nbeam is incident on a first, small cylindrical cell of rubidium of optical thickness 0.2, where photons undergo\nat most one scattering event with a well defined position.\nA 2 mm-diameter pencil of diffused light propagating in\na direction orthogonal to the initial laser beam is then\nselected by two 12 cm-spaced diaphragms. This scheme\nproduces photons with a frequency spectrum \u0398(\u03c9) given\nby the Doppler broadening. If we neglect the finite but\nsmall width of the atomic transition, the absorption spectrum is also purely Doppler, and Eq. (3) holds. The scattered light then goes through the 7 cm-long observation\n\nLaser beam\n\nCCD\n\nFIG. 1: The experimental setup. A laser beam is incident on a so-called source cell filled with rubidium vapour.\nScattered light propagating at orthogonal direction is selected\nwith two diaphragms and illuminates a second, observation\ncell.

This fluorescence signal is proportional\nto the step size distribution function.\n\ncell, with an angle of about 10\u25e6 from the cell axis to avoid\nstray reflections at the center of the image. Raw images\nof the fluorescence signal are obtained after a 30 minutes\nexposure. Reproducible noise is then eliminated by subtracting a dark frame. The resulting image is shown in\nFig. 2(b). We extract the corresponding step size distribution P (x) (shown on a log-log scale in Fig. 3) by\ntaking longitudinal slices along the incident direction of\npropagation. This signal is integrated over 30 lines of\nthe CCD matrix (corresponding to 1.6 mm in the cell),\nthen smoothened over 30 pixels along the x direction to\nincrease the signal to noise ratio. In order to obtain the\ncorrect P (x) distribution, we need to correct the effect\nof multiple scattering on the signal. We thus subtract\nthe intensity measured along a slice slightly off the line\nof sight of the diaphragms, which is due only to multiple\nscattering, from the intensity measured on the central\nslice (see the Methods section). We clearly identify a\n\nFIG. 2: Fluorescence images Data are obtained after an\nexposure time of 30 minutes and dark frame subtraction, for\n(a) an incident laser beam at the atomic resonance frequency\nand (b) incident light provided by a first scattering cell.

We have also checked that varying the atomic density in the observation cell from 7 \u00d7 1016 to 2 \u00d7 1017 m\u22123\nhas no impact on the measured value of \u03b1.\nThis result calls for two important comments. First,\nthe exponent \u03b1 is smaller than 3. We can thus not ignore the heavy tails of the step size distribution. The\nvariance of P (x) is infinite, making this distribution characteristic of L\u00e9vy flights. Second, we measure an important difference compared to the prediction \u03b1 = 2 expected when the natural width \u0393 of the atomic transition is neglected [Eq. (3)]. Even though this width\n\u0393/2\u03c0 = 6 MHz is much smaller than the Doppler broadening \u2206\u03c9D /2\u03c0 \u223c 220 MHz, one cannot neglect the effect of the natural Lorentzian line shape on the atomic\nabsorption profile. In the opposite limit of negligible\nDoppler broadening (\u2206\u03c9D \u226a \u0393) one expects to recover\nthe cold-atom limit, where all momenta of the step size\ndistribution are finite. It is thus not surprising that the\nactual case of a finite natural width does increase the absolute value of the exponent from the ideal Doppler limit,\nwhere \u03b1 = 2. A power law fit to the step size distribution\n\nP (x) obtained by including this finite natural width in\nthe numerical integration of Eq. (2) yields an exponent\nof 2.3, close to the experimental value. We have also implemented a more refined model, taking into account all\nhyperfine levels of rubidium atoms including the hyperfine Raman transitions (see the Methods section). The\nresult of this numerical calculation is in excellent agreement with the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3.\nAlthough the finite natural line width is only a few percents of the Doppler width, it surprisingly changes the\npower law exponent by 15%. The measured difference to\n\u03b1 = 2 has a particular significance, as for \u03b1 \u2264 2, even the\nmean free path is no longer defined, in contrast to \u03b1 > 2\nwhere hxi is still finite.\nThe knowledge of the single step size distribution for\nphotons which have been scattered only once by hot\natoms is however not sufficient to describe the multiple\nscattering regime. Indeed, the spectral characteristics of\nthe photons depend on their previous history. For instance, at angles close to forward scattering, the Doppler\nbroadening is very small and the scattering can be considered to be almost elastic. This feature is described by\na partial frequency redistribution of the photons during\ntheir multiple scattering process [10] and can be understood as a memory effect in the random walk sequence.\nIn order to have experimental access to the step size distribution (and therefore to its exponent in case of power\nlaws) in a multiple scattering regime, it is important to\nextract the single step size distribution of a photon that\nhas been scattered several times by hot atoms.\nTo determine numerically the shape of the step size\ndistribution Pn for photons after n scattering events, we\ncompute the evolution of the spectrum \u0398n of scattered\nlight, taking into account Doppler broadening and averaging over the scattering angles [17]. Pn is then obtained\nby using Eq. (2) with \u0398n (see the Methods section).\nThe numerics show that Pn quickly converges towards a\npower law, which is independent of the initial frequency,\nand hence, that the step size distribution of light in the\nmultiple scattering regime is well defined. The corresponding power law exponent \u03b1(n) is reported on Fig.\n4.\nIn order to approach experimentally the situation of\nmultiple scattering, we have implemented a triple cell\ngeometry. In a first cell, with an on-resonance optical\nthickness on the order of 2, we prepare photons that have\nbeen scattered several times (n \u223c 4) when they leave the\ncell. Those photons have thus no memory of their initial direction and their properties are well described by\nan angular average of the fluorescence spectrum. These\nphotons are then sent towards the \"source cell\" of Fig.\n1, which still has a low optical thickness. Photons thus\nundergo one more scattering event with a well defined\nposition before they can arrive onto the observation cell.\nThis experimental protocol allows us to produce photons\nwhich have done multiple scattering and forgotten their\ninitial direction and frequency, as required for a steady\nstate situation. We then record the image of the fluores-\n\n\f4\n2.6\n\nP (x)\n\n2.5\n2.4\n\n\u03b1 (n)\n\nthat P (x) follows a power law with an exponent 1.5 leading to an infinite mean free path [16].

The\ndouble cell configuration (n = 1) [Fig. 1] yields at 90\u25e6 a\npure Doppler-broadened spectrum and the measured \u03b1 (red\ntriangle) is \u03b1 = 2.41 \u00b1 0.12. For the triple cell configuration,\nphotons are scattered about 5 times before entering the observation cell. The measured exponent is then \u03b1 = 2.09 \u00b1 0.15\n(blue triangle). The data and fit for this last configuration\nare shown in the inset. Vertical error bars represent the uncertainty of the power law fit. The blue dots are numerically\ncomputed with the real atomic structure and an angular average of the Doppler-broadened frequency spectrum. For comparison with the experiment, the open red circle is computed\nwithout angular average.\n\ncence on the CCD. The signal in this geometry is much\nweaker than in the previous double cell geometry and is\nlimited by photon shot noise and cosmic rays. From the\nmedian averaging of 6 images corresponding to an exposure time of 5 hours each, we are still able to extract\nthe step size distribution P (x) after multiple scattering\nand obtain a value \u03b1 = 2.09 \u00b1 0.15 [Fig. 4]. This value,\nclearly below 3, excludes a diffusion approach to be used\nfor multiple scattering of light in hot atomic vapours.\nThis experimental result is in good agreement with our\nnumerical estimation of the power law, taking into account all details of the atomic transition [Fig. 4].\nTo conclude, we have directly measured the step size\ndistribution of photons undergoing a random walk in hot\natomic vapours. Despite a memory effect due to partial frequency redistribution, the step size distribution\nof photons in hot atomic vapours converges after a few\nsteps to a power law with a diverging second moment.\nTherefore photon trajectories in such a system are L\u00e9vy\nflights. The experiments described in this article show\nhow it is possible to obtain direct information on the microscopic ingredient leading to superdiffusion of light in\nhot atomic vapours and open the path to study the role\nof other broadening mechanisms, such as pressure broadening or inelastic scattering at large intensities, where\nthe absorption cross sections still have Lorentzian wings,\nas for natural broadening. However, in these cases, the\nemission spectra are very different as one no longer has\ncoherent emission processes, and one expects in that case\n\nCorrection of multiply scattered light. The required\ndynamic to determine the asymptotic behavior of P (x) needs\na fine trade-off between the amount of single scattering and\nthe need to avoid multiple scattering in the observation\ncell. This is adjusted by the cell temperature and the\nsubsequent atomic density. At 41\u25e6 C, the temperature used\nfor our measurements, this density is about 7 \u00d7 1016 m\u22123 ,\nas deduced from the laser beam attenuation. The mean\nfree path for resonant photons is then \u223c 9 mm, and the\neffect of multiple scattering cannot be totally neglected. It\ncan however be corrected. The intensity measured along\nthe axis of the incident light beam can indeed be written\nI(x, 0) = I1 (x, 0) + In\u22652 (x, 0), where I1 is the intensity due\nto single scattering of ballistic photons, In\u22652 the one due\nto multiple scattering. Slightly off the axis, however, only\nIn\u22652 remains. Assuming a smooth variation of In\u22652 (x, d)\nat distances d much smaller than the mean free path of\nresonant light we use I2 (x, d) \u2243 I2 (x, 0) to subtract higher\norder scattering along the center of the cell. Hence, we get\nP (x) \u221d I1 (x, 0) \u221d I(x, 0) \u2212 I(x, d). Step size distribution\nmeasurements are thus obtained by subtracting intensity\nsignals observed on and off the ballistic beam axis. A Monte\nCarlo simulation, which can track the position of a photon\nemerging from the observation cell and register the number\nof scattering it has performed, confirmed that this procedure\nefficiently filters single scattering events in the observation\ncell.\nNumerical calculation of the step size distribution for\nreal atoms. The step size distribution is computed from Eq.\n(2) with the knowledge of the frequency-dependent mean-free\npath l(\u03c9) (the inverse of which is the absorption spectrum)\nand the emission spectrum \u0398(\u03c9). The mean free path at\nfrequency \u03c9 is given by\nZ +\u221e \"\nvx \"\n1\n= nat\n) PM,1 (vx )dvx ,\n(5)\n\u03c3 \u03c9(1 \u2212\nl(\u03c9)\nc\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere nat is the atomic density, PM,1 is the Maxwell distribution of atomic velocities vx along the direction of light propagation x in the observation cell, and \u03c3 is the atomic crosssection, taken at the Doppler-shifted frequency \u03c9(1 \u2212 vcx ).\nThe emission spectrum in the first cell is given by\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n\"\nvy \"\n\u03981 (\u03c9) \u221d\n)\ndvy \u03980 (\u03c9 \u2032 ) \u03c3 \u03c9 \u2032 (1 \u2212\nd\u03c9 \u2032\ndvx\nc\n\u2212\u221e\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n\"\n\"\nvy\nvx\n\u00d7 PM,2 (vx , vy ) \u03b4 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 (1 \u2212 )(1 +\n) ,\n(6)\nc\nc\nwhere \u03980 (\u03c9 \u2032 ) is the spectrum of the incident laser propagatv\ning along y, \u03c9at = \u03c9 \u2032 (1 \u2212 cy ) is the incident photon frequency\nin the atomic rest frame for atoms at velocity vy along y, and\n\u03c9at (1 + vcx ) is the frequency in the laboratory frame of the\nphoton emitted along x, towards the second cell. PM,2 is the\nMaxwell distribution of atomic velocities along two directions.\n\n\f5\nThe Dirac distribution inside the integral denotes the energy\nconservation during coherent scattering, the only change in\nfrequency coming from Doppler shifts. We take as the laser\nspectrum \u03980 a Lorentzian of width 0.6 MHz. With twolevel atoms, the cross-section \u03c3 is Lorentzian-shaped (natural\nwidth \u0393/2\u03c0 = 6.07 MHz) and we obtain the first order step\nsize distribution by reporting Eqs. (1,5,6) into Eq. (2). Taking into account all the levels of rubidium atoms is done by\nwriting the scattering cross-section as the sum of all the possible transitions weighted by their respective strength factors\nand with the hypothesis of an equipartition of atomic population among all possible states.\nThe multiple scattering regime is characterized by the nth\norder step size distribution function, which is computed by\n\nusing \u0398n (\u03c9) instead of \u0398(\u03c9) in Eq. (2). The evolution of\nthe spectrum, taking into account Doppler broadening and\naveraging over the scattering angles [17], is then given by\n\n[1] L\u00e9vy, P.
