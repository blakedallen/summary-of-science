The model\nsuggests explanations for considerable experimental work and offers a physical\nexplanation for the basis of the Uemura-Homes law.\n\n1\n\n\f1. Background.\nEarly work by one of us [2] emphasized the importance for the properties of the hole\nliquids flowing through initial antiferromagnetic assemblies of Cu spins in the normal\nstate of high Tc superconductors (SC). This proposal has been strongly supported by the\nrecent experimental study of Jin et. al. [3]. Subsequently, Egorov and March [1] used\nnormal state experimental values of electrical resistivities R and nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation time T1 at Cu sites in YBa2Cu4O6 to plot the product RT vs. temperature T . A\nlinear relationship between RT and T is in evidence over a temperature range from\n150 \uf02d 450K for this superconductor (see Fig 2 in [4b]). As the sample was further\ncooled, there was a minimum around 100K as the superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc was more closely approached, subsequently interpreted as due to an\nelectronic phase change resulting in preformed CPs (bound BKT vortices) above Tc .\nThis possibility had been predicted in the theoretical work of Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink\n[5] prior to the discovery of high- Tc superconductors. In their review on spin fluctuations\nand high Tc superconductivity, Motiya and Ueda [6] write that the relaxation\nrate 1 associated with Cu sites is quite different from the conventional Korringa\nT1\n\uf03d const . They conclude that this relaxation rate for\nrelaxation for metals, namely 1\nT1T\nhigh- Tc cuprates saturates at elevated temperatures so that 1\nbehaves similarly to the\nT1T\nCurie-Weiss law, a conclusion was already anticipated by Egorov and March [3].\nIt has been speculated by some [7] that details regarding the nature of the preformed CP\nin high- Tc models may not be necessary since the coherence length is comparatively small\nand therefore takes place in coordinate space. Indeed, progress has resulted by use of a\nvery general theory based on a \"hard core\" boson field \uf066 \uf028 r \uf029 , where the internal structure\nis completely ignored. A number of features can be understood with this approach, but a\nmore complete explanation of important features such as the itinerant (delocalized)\nCooper pairing mechanism, the pseudogap and the Nernst effect require a detailed\nstructure of the preformed Cooper pair. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the\nrelevance of the \"soft\" boson preformed pair which could have a more general\noccurrence.\nThe outline is as follows; first we summarize some experimental and theoretical\nboundaries a successful cuprate model must have in Section 2 along with our proposed\n\"soft\" boson model. Section 3 is a brief discussion of the BKT theory, the model basis,\nwhile section 4 offers an explanation of the SC dome and the pseudogap region of the\nphase diagram including the 2D to 3D transition. Comparison with other similar\nphenomena is contained Section 5, followed by a summary, conclusions, and proposals\nfor future study in Section 6. An Appendix discussing \"soft\" bosons follows.\n\n2\n\n\f2. Experimental and Theoretical Boundaries for Cuprate Model.\n2.1. Experiment. Jin et al [2] presents evidence relating an electron liquid flowing\nthrough an antiferromagnetic assembly discussed earlier. More specifically, in studies of\nelectron-doped cuprate SC's (no pseudogap), there is a linear dependence of the\nscattering rate on temperature that correlates with electron pairing above Tc and it\ncontinues to zero temperature. Additional confirmation of local electron pairing is also\nevident in the STM data of Kohsaka et al [8], providing data on cuprate SC in very low\ndoping conditions. Using quasi-particle interference (QPI) imaging that allows them to\ndetermining the material's electronic structure in k- and r- space simultaneously, they\nobserve the transfer of spectral weight to the higher energy r-space states which are\nlocalized Cooper pairs, breaking translational and rotational symmetries at the atomic\nscale. Delocalized Cooper pairs vanish as the Mott insulator is approached by removing\na few holes, leaving \"localized\" Cooper pairs. Additional STM studies by Pan et al [9]\nsuggest vortices in other HTSC materials (YBCO and BSCCO) as a common\nphenomenology. Lastly, a model needs to satisfy the empirical Uemura-Holmes laws\n[10, 11] which states that Tc is proportional to the superfluid density \uf072 s near T 0\nmultiplied by the electrical resistivity \uf072 dc just above Tc (see Section 4 for discussion).\n2.2. Theory. To focus only on crucial correlation terms in as rigorous a Hamiltonian\noperator as practical, we use an electron density form as formulated by Bohm and Pines\n[12], and Turlakov and Leggett [13], namely\np2 \u2020\n1\n(2.1)\nH\u02c6 \uf03d \uf0e5\nc p,\uf073 c p,\uf073 \uf02b\n\uf0e5Vq \uf0e9\uf0eb \uf072\u02c6q \uf072\u02c6\uf02dq \uf02d N \uf0f9\uf0fb \uf02b \uf06b\uf0e5\uf0b90 U\uf02d\uf06b \uf072\u02c6\uf06b\n2\uf057 q\np ,\uf073 2m\nwith\n\uf072\u02c6 q \uf03d \uf0e5 ck\u2020\uf02dq ,\uf073 ck ,\uf073 \uf03d \uf0e5 e\uf02diqri\n(2.2)\nk ,\uf073\n\n\u2020\nk ,\uf073 k ,\uf073\n\nThe c c\n\nri\n\nare the creation and annihilation operators, respectively, the total density\n\noperator is N , the number of electrons, \uf057 , the volume, and \uf072 k is the Fourier transform of\nthe density operator. The first and second terms are the kinetic and coulomb terms of\nonly the electrons; the last term is a lattice interaction where U \uf02d\uf06b is an Umklapp potential\ninteracting with electron density summed over reciprocal lattice wave vectors \uf06b . Within\nthe limits of the Hamiltonian above, there are at least two theoretical conditions which\nany proposed solution of the cuprate HTSC problem needs to address.\n1) Turlakov et al have used the above Hamiltonian to establish sum moment rules which\nrestrict the upper and lower bounds on electron Coulomb energy, thereby restricting the\npossible models for the cuprate superconductors. One possibility meeting this\nrequirement is a band in the mid-infrared (MIR) region of the spectrum; high Tc cuprates\nsatisfy this requirement by showing absorption from 40 to 200 meV (MIR region).\nWulin et al found this broad peak to be highly correlated with their interpretation that the\npseudogap results from preformed pairs. They conclude that their model is consistent\nwith the sum rules [14].\n\n3\n\n\f2) If a two dimensional solution is proposed, it needs to be local and then perhaps expand\ninto the third dimension for superconductivity to satisfy the Mermin-Wagner-HohenbergColeman (MWHC) theorem [15] which states that long range order is not possible in one\nor two dimensions.\n2.3 Proposed Model for a Preformed Cooper Pair.\nIt is well known that instability near the Fermi energy caused by an attraction affects both\nthe lattice and the electron gas. This attraction can be a fluctuation of the electron density\nthat under certain conditions undergoes a phase transition to a charge density wave\n(CDW) [16]. The result is a frozen lattice distortion in a macroscopically occupied\nphonon mode that can be described by an order parameter\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf044 ei\uf066 \uf03d g b2 kF \uf02b b\uf02d\u20202 kF\n\n\uf029\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe periodic boundary conditions can represent a circular system and the same equations\nobtain as in a typical linear CDW solution. The circular solution (circDW) can be viewed\nas a very weak pole in the density-density correlation function eq (2.1) and have some\nfeatures in common with rotons (see Section 5.1). After substitution in the Frohlich\nHamiltonian, some approximations, and diagonalization by a Bogoliubov-Valatin\ntransformation, the resulting binding energy of a circDW has the same form as a\nsuperconductor [16],\n\uf02d1\ng 2 n \uf028\uf065 F \uf029\n(2.4)\n\uf044 \uf03d 2\uf065 F e \uf06c\n\uf06c\uf03d\n\uf03d g ' n \uf028\uf065 F \uf029\n\n\uf0772k\n\nF\n\nwhere \uf06c is a dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant resulting in a correlation\nenergy of approximately\nn \uf028\uf065 F \uf029 2\nEcond Enorm \uf02d ECDW \uf03d\n\uf044\n(2.5)\n2\nA material containing circDW's could be an insulator if two circDW's are bound; on the\nother hand if they are not, they might be a significant factor in conductivity as other have\nsuggested previously [17]. Based on the STM evidence above, we view the circCDW as\na vortex and propose the Egorov-March phase change follows as the temperature is\nlowered where two vortices become paired following a modified BKT theory (Section 3).\nThis is a different notion of a Cooper pair with a \"d\" symmetry structure (see Section 5\nfor analogies) and a possibly larger energy/smaller size can result (see Appendix A). As\nmentioned, preformed pairs were predicted by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink [5], and\naugmented by Ohashi and Griffin [7c] to include two types of Cooper pairs, one pair\nlocalized and the other mobile. As the charge of the proposed vortex pair is now 2e, we\ncall this vortex pair a Circ2DW or a localized Cooper pair (LCP). Being boson-like in\nnature, the LCP/Circ2DW will suppress the single particle spectrum as observed in the\ncuprates.\n\n4\n\n\f3. Vortices.\n3.1.

The Transition from 2D to 3D\nThe transition to three dimensions of the \"soft\" boson model generates a rich phase\ndiagram reflecting at least five \"zones\" of order parameters as the SC dome is traversed\nwith increasing doping. Zone one and three begin and finish with a dominant order,\nrespectively, but zone two (the peak) has interactions which extend into zones four and\nfive in the pseudogap in our model. A qualitative description is first, followed by detail.\nAs expected, the local \"soft\" Cooper pairs (LCP's) play a significant role. First, the\nsingle-particle tunneling between nearby planes is strongly suppressed by the bosonic\nnature of the LCP's. Secondly, the characteristic energy scale is set by the phase stiffness\nat zero temperature as suggested earlier by Emery and Kivelson [30], which is physically\nexpressed in our model by the LCP's (eq 3.8). Lastly, the energy of the vortex seems to\ncontrol the superconducting Tc [31]. The impact of these statements begins as doping\n\n8\n\n\fincreases along with the superfluid density ns and Tc . Being bosonic in nature, all of the\nlocal CP's will be assumed to have the same wave function in their ground state at low\ntemperatures which decays outward from their core in all directions. They are very\nanisotropic as their x, y dimension is much larger than their z component. Hence, it\nshould be expected that their in-plane properties should reflect this in a \"2D SC\" (see\ndiscussion and figure in [32]). The z component coherent decay from bound vortices will\ncreate a finite superfluid density which may assist or interfere with any other coherent\ncomponents such as Josephson junctions. As the doping and the transition temperature\nrises, three factors contribute to the peak of the dome: 1) some bosons (LCP's) become\nexcited out of the ground state causing loss of phase coherence, 2) the density of bound\nvortices will lead to interaction between them, thereby losing their effectiveness and 3)\nthe paired vortices can dissociate into +/- \"component\" vortices. All of these effects lead\nto the peak in Tc . The dissociation of vortices results in zones four and five where the\ndynamic qualities of the adjacent portion of the pseudogap where the lower temperature\nportion of the pseudogap composed of LCP's and CircDW's initially balanced in +/vortices. The resulting dissipation could result in a net loss of the vortex balance in the\nelectron fluid creating a considerable viscosity. This event will take place over a larger\ntemperature range than the classical BKT universal jump (see below). As the\ntemperature is raised to the higher temperature portion of the pseudogap (zone five), it is\nsuggested that a different phase such as a linear CDW might prevail as certain\nexperiments reveal attributes of a \"superconductor\" persisting to high temperatures. The\npeak in Tc has multiple interactions; the predominant contribution to superconductivity in\nzone 2 is initially a superfluid which competes with resonance interaction as they both\nexclusively need the LCP to function. As the dome is traversed, the resonance interaction\nbecomes dominant, then collapses into zone 3 where a BCS-like SC prevails. More\ndetails follow.\n4.2.1. Zone 1 of the SC dome.\nThe density of bound vortices is too low for BEC. We propose fluctuational superfluid\npatches which control the superconducting transition temperature through \"long\" range\norder as a result of overlap with other bosons by phase locking in 3D patches of\nsuperfluidity; hence the superfluid density is small in the cuprates. To describe the\nsuperfluid density, we first want to examine the contrast with the BCS theory which has a\nfinite gap function 2 \uf044 everywhere, so the probability of exciting quasiparticles is quite\n\uf02d2 \uf044\n\nlow if kBT 2 \uf044 , since nn \uf028T \uf029 e kBT . But in a d-wave cuprate superconductor \uf044 \uf0ae 0\nat nodal points on the Fermi surface, so it is always possible to excite quasiparticles with\nthe result that nn \uf028T \uf029 T as experimentally verified [33], on the underdoped side of the\ndome. Thus, the nodal quasiparticles shown to lead to an initial linear relationship of the\nsuperfluid stiffness [34],\n(4.1)\nns \uf028T \uf029 \uf03d ns \uf028 0\uf029 \uf02d aT\nThis relationship can be compared with a corresponding boson relationship, namely\n\uf0e6 mk T \uf0f6\nns \uf028T \uf029 \uf03d ns \uf028 0 \uf029 \uf02d 2.612 \uf0e7 B 2 \uf0f7\n(4.2)\n\uf0e8 2\uf070 \uf0f8\n\n9\n\n\fAs is well known, a measurement of the London penetration depth as a function of\ntemperature \uf06c \uf028T \uf029 can be converted into the superfluid density as a function of\ntemperature ns \uf028T \uf029 using [10]\n1\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f6 2\nme\n(4.2)\n\uf06c \uf028T \uf029 \uf03d \uf0e7\uf0e7\n2 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0e8 \uf06d0 ns \uf028T \uf029 e \uf0f8\nAs doping increases, the transition temperature T increases until \"zone 2\" is reached.\n4.2.2 Zone 2: The boson density remains below the critical BEC level.\nThe density of superfluidity will drop for the reasons cited in Section 4.1 The transition\nbetween zones one and two will be smooth as the boson-fermion Hamiltonian can be\nrewritten [7a] so that only eigenstates with a macroscopic N 0 are relevant for T \uf03c Tc and\n1\n\napproximate b0 \uf0bb N 0 2 . The vortex pair remains intact and it now becomes a resonant\ninteraction center for spin wave order interacting with the vortex charge order for which\nwe can write an interaction H I eq (4.3) and add this term to eq (3.10) resulting in eq\n(4.4),\nN0\n(4.3)\nH I \uf03d gr\n\uf0e5[c\uf02d p,\uf073 cp\uf073\uf075 \uf028 p \uf029 \uf02b h.c.]\nV p ,\uf073\nH\nH\n1\n2\n\uf03d K \uf0f2 d 2 r \uf028 \uf0d1\uf066 \uf029 \uf02b vor \uf02b H int\n(4.4)\nk BT 2\nk BT\nEvidence for the complex comes from three independent sources: first is the work of Mei\nand Weng [35] who deduce the universal formula eq (4.5) from a spin-roton model of\nE\nk BTc \uf03d g\n(4.5)\n\uf06b\nclassical BKT theory where E g is the resonance energy in both inelastic neutron and\nelectronic Raman scattering experiments and \uf06b 6 . It can be shown that this\nrelationship also applies to our model. Second, we have followed the lead of McDonald\nand others [36] who found a mapping overlap of spin correlation, Cooper pair correlation,\nand incommensurability. We added an additional correlation with the checkerboard\npattern observed in STM experiments on cuprates and a \"d\" symmetry for a LCP. The\noverall result suggests that the interaction center described by eq (4.4) where a spin order\ninteracts with charge order with an offset of \uf070 in the phase as noted by McDonald can\n2\naccount for the charge-spin interaction as Gruner describes (also see fig 6.7, [17]). As\ndoping further increases, this interaction diminishes allowing BCS-like superconductivity\nto prevail. We discuss the pseudogap next.\n4.2.3 Superfluid Density Above Tc in the Presence of Disorder.\nRecent experiments on the cuprates including Nernst effect [38], finite frequency\nconductivity [39], and nonlinear magnetization [40], thought to be examples of BKT\n\n10\n\n\fphase fluctuations, have failed to find the superfluid density universal jump at TBKT .\nBenfatto and others suggest that the downturn is no longer universal, but occurs at a\ntemperature TD depending on the vortex energy, EV , which seems to depend on the SC\nmodel. This contrasts with the universal value for the previously discussed 2D XY\nmodel. Their renormalization study suggests that as soon as there is interlayer coupling,\nthe jump is removed and replaced by a downward bend in at TD \uf03e TBKT reflecting the\nvortex-core energy \uf06d which scales linearly with Tc [41, 42] (compare with eq 4.5)).\nSince it appears from experiment that the vortex core and the superfluid (phase) stiffness,\neq 3.8), are interacting, it seems that the previously assumed conserving approximation\n(gauge invariance) for the electromagnetic kernel K ab breaks down in the classical BKT\ntheory. The BCS approximation is not conserving, but in that theory phase fluctuations\nonly contribute to the longitudinal portion of K ab . This is no longer true in the presence\nof the disorder due to the formation of \"soft\" boson structures larger than the lattice\nspacing. The phase couples with both the transverse and longitudinal parts leading to the\ninteraction term above, eq (4.5), as evidence by the \uf070 term in the spin-charge\n2\ninteraction.\nThe 2D BKT-like transition at temperature TD combined with Nernst effect experiments\non hole-doped cuprates suggests zone four of the pseudogap seems to contain a large\nregion just above Tc where a vortex liquid exists even though the Meissner effect is absent.\nSome vortices survive above Tc where they dissociate into circCDW's. We can use\nprevious studies of vorticity to encompass the non-ideality present in the non-uniform\ndissociation. The region is dominated by entropy as previously indicated and seem to\nhave a relatively uniform distribution which can be described by\n\uf0e9 E\n\uf0f9\n\uf0e6 1\uf0f6\n(4.6)\nn pair \uf03d \uf0e7 2 \uf0f7 exp \uf0ea\uf02d c\n\uf028T \uf02d Tc \uf029\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0e8a \uf0f8\n\uf0eb\nExperimental evidence suggest the conductance is unusual and contain descriptions such\nas Orenstein and other's \"interpenetrating electrons and vortices\" [43], Anguilar and\nothers \"pair breaking and coherence peak\" in cuprate conductivity [44], Li and others\n\"diamagnetism and Cooper pairing above Tc \" [45], Anderson's \"incompressible vortex\"\nBose Fluid above Tc [46] and Dubroka's \"precursor superconductivity as high as 180K\"\n[47]. It appears that the experimental attributes of a \"superconductor\" could persist to\nhigh temperatures comprising zone 5.\nAn electrostatic description suggests that below TKT , the system has \"charge\nconfinement\"; it is an insulator. Above TKT , bound pairs dissociate and the system is a\nconductor, becoming a \"plasma\" of electrons and coherent vortices. In this regard the\nwork of S. Chakravarty and others [48] also merits further studies in the context of the\npseudogap phase of the hole-doped cuprates which is proposed to be characterized by a\nhidden broken symmetry of the d x2 \uf02d y2 \uf02d type . These workers argue that the transition to\n11\n\n\fthis state is \"rounded by disorder\", but in the limit of sufficiently small disorder the\npseudogap crossover should reveal itself to be such a transition. It is asserted that the\nordered state breaks time-reversal, translational, and rotational symmetries, but remains\ninvariant under the combination of any two. One interesting outcome is the prediction of\na metal-metal transition under the superconducting dome. The model presented breaks\ntranslational and rotational symmetry in the bound BKT state, and all three symmetries in\nthe proposed pseudogap state.\n\n4.2.4 Zone 3: The Fermi liquid returns and the interaction is BCS-like [7a].\nWith no interaction, there is a degenerate Fermi distribution and no bosons and the\nk2\n\uf03c \uf075 . If g \uf0b9 0 , H1 continuously extends into a BCS\nhighest Fermi energy is \uf065 F \uf03d F\n2m\ntype system with an attraction of initial fermion momenta k and \uf02dk inside the Fermi sea\nto p and \uf02d p outside and \uf075 \uf028 k \uf029 1 \uf075 \uf028 p \uf029 and the attractive interaction\n\ng2\n\uf03c0\n2 \uf028\uf065 k \uf02d \uf075 \uf029\n\uf02d\uf06c\n\n(4.7)\n\nresults in a BCS-like gap. Then, \uf044 ' \uf0b5 e g , so the phonon process is replaced by pair\ncreation and annihilation through the resonance boson state. As Tcdw \uf0ae 0 , both the\nBoson-induced superfluidity and the resonance boson state significantly diminish\nallowing BCS superconductivity to prevail.\n2\n\nUemura-Homes' law\nUemura's law [10], that the superfluid density \uf072 s of the SC cuprates linearly scales to\nTc at low doping was one of the first systematic trends in these new materials. Optimally\nand overdoped materials did not follow this relationship. Later, Homes and others [49]\ndeveloped a universal scaling relation that holds for a number of high-Tc SC's for the\nentire SC dome,\n\uf072s \uf03d A\uf073 \uf028Tc \uf029 Tc\nwhere A is a constant and \uf073 \uf028Tc \uf029 is the normal state conductivity at Tc . Using the\ninsightful description of Zaanen [50], we suggest connections of our proposal to Homes'\nlaw:\n1) Comparing Zaanen's formulas for superconducting and normal states, we have\n\n\uf072S :\n\n\uf072S \uf0572p,S \uf03d 4\uf070 nS e2 me\n\nsuperconducting\n\n\uf0572p, N \uf03d 4\uf070 nN e2 me\n\nnormal\n\n12\n\n\f\uf057 p ,S , \uf057 p, N are the plasma frequencies of the SC and normal states, and nS , nN are the SC\nand normal states mobile electron densities, respectively. We suggest the plasma\nfrequencies might relate to the BKT bound vortices (SC) and the CircDW (N) entities\nwhich might offer a method of calculating their strengths.\n2) \uf073 \uf028Tc \uf029 \uf03d \uf0572p, N\uf074 \uf028Tc \uf029 8\uf070 2 : As Zaanen states, the \"normal\" state just above Tc might be\nexpected to be viscous can be rationalized by the modified BKT bound vortices which are\n\"melting\" over an extended range to TD . Alternatively, Egorov and March's observation\n[1] supports the increase in viscosity as the LCP are formed just above Tc . When the\nbound vortices completely melt, a lack of balance in the +/- vortices could create another\nstage of a complex, viscous electronic liquid.\n3) The relationship between \uf072 s and Tc was discussed earlier.\n4.4 Comments about the Condensation Energy and a Suggested Gap Equation.\nOur first focus in this section is to try and identify the source of the energy of\ncondensation. Marel and others have stated that fluctuations must be counted when the\ncondensation energy is calculated [51]. The model we have presented suggests the\nexistence of several precursor and competing energy states: a LCP, a CircDW, a\ndelocalized CP ( CPdeloc ), and possibly a linear CDW at higher energies. This relationship\nis:\nLCP\n2circDW \uf02b\ncircDW \uf028 \uf02b \uf029 \uf02b circDW \uf028 \uf02d \uf029\n\uf02d\n2\uf02d\nCPdeloc\n2e\uf02d\nCircDW\nlinearDW(CDW )\nIt is not clear to us at this moment how to precisely evaluate the condensation energy.\nCertainly to make progress it seems apparent that the large entropy associated with the\ndissociation of a classical BKT bound vortex might offer a starting point [52].\n.\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\n5. Other Similar Quasi-particles [53].\n5.1 Helium. Following Landau [54] and Feynman [55], an important property of\nsuperfluid helium is that the only low energy excitations possible in superfluid helium are\ncollective density waves, the lack of low-lying single particle excitations occurs\nbecause 4 He is a boson and assuming we are below the Landau critical velocity. Then,\nthe phonons are dissipationless and the low energy excitations of these collective density\nwaves are minimized by a coherent distribution of momentum. If the exact ground state\nwave function is known, the density wave excited state variational wave function can be\nwritten as (at wave vector k ),\n\uf046k \uf03d 1\n\uf072\uf079\n(5.1)\nN k\nN being the number of particles and \uf072 k , the Fourier transform of the density operator\n\n13\n\n\f\uf072\u02c6 q \uf03d \uf0e5 ck\u2020\uf02dq ,\uf073 ck ,\uf073 \uf03d \uf0e5 e\uf02diqr\n\n(5.2)\n\ni\n\nk ,\uf073\n\nri\n\nand \uf072 k must have a significant density modulation at k resulting in the Bijl-Feynman\nequation [56]:\nf \uf028k \uf029\n(5.3)\n\uf044 \uf028k \uf029 \uf03d\ns \uf028k \uf029\nwith the norm of the excited state being\n\nf \uf028k \uf029 \uf03d\n\n\uf079 \uf072k\u2020 \uf028 H \uf02d E0 \uf029 \uf072k \uf079\n\n(5.4)\nN\n( H is the Hamiltonian and E0 ,the ground state).

Lower dimensions may not have as prominent a\nscattering, particularly if the numbers of these analogous structures is low (see [57] for an\ninteresting discussion). It appears as though this type of structure is observed\nexperimentally; Greytak et al [58] using Raman scattering found only a single peak near\ntwice the single roton energy. Zawadowski, Ruvalds and Solano (ZRS) [59] then\nassumed that the roton-roton interaction is attractive and suggested a bound state must\nexist below the two roton continuum at energy \uf065 \uf03d 2\uf0440 \uf02d Eb , Eb being the binding energy,\nanalogous to Cooper pair formation in BCS theory, i.e. a bound state will appear no\nmatter how small the attractive coupling with a binding energy. Greytak later confirmed\nthe binding energy and the d-type angular momentum of the bound state. Another\nconclusion of this study was the significant impact of the two-particle states on the oneparticle spectrum (illustrated in Fig 1a [59]). This feature involves considerable spectral\nweight transfer, a phenomenon also seen in the cuprates.\n5.2. Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). In the development of effective theories\nto describe the FQHE Girvin, MacDonald, and Platzman [60] modified Feynman's\nexcitation theory for helium superfluid to describe the collective excitation gap with the\nanalogy that the Hall resistance is almost dissipation-less. It proved especially interesting\nwhen Rezayi and Haldane found quantitative evidence for off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO) in Quantum Hall States [61].\n\n14\n\n\f5.3. BEC. In cold-atom BEC studies the roton arises through anisotropic dipole-dipole\ninteractions (density-density correlation) which are partially attractive and result in two\nrotons binding in with a \"d\" symmetry. These features are absent in repulsive shortranged s-wave interactions. O'Dell and others [62] have been able to drive the transition\nby laser intensity as illustrated by the BEC structure factor S \uf028 k \uf029 as further discussed by\nMinguzzi, March and Tosi [63]. This type of structure is particularly interesting to study\nas the roton minimum has been suggested to being very close to incipient crystallization\nas the ordering of atoms leads to a peak in S \uf028 k \uf029 and perhaps, ultimately, a solid-fluid\ntransition, as discussed by Nozieres [64].\n5.4. Comparison of KT and other similar quasi-particles.\nThere are other comparisons between these quasi-particles and the LCP-BKT model of\nsuperconductivity (see [53] for those not discussed here). It is plausible that the BKT\nCooper pair has a \"d\" symmetry, similar to the roton-roton interactions discussed above.\nSecondly, and more specifically, Magro and Ceperley [65] have noted that the 2D Bose\nCoulomb liquid (2DBCL) contains long range correlations similar to the bosonic\nrepresentation of Laughlin's wave function and identical to Girvin and MacDonald's\nalgebraic long-range order. It is a different matter at short range as Laughlin's wave\nfunction for two particles is classical in nature while quantum mechanical 2DBCL results\nin a depressed but finite probability for this comparison. Both Magro et al and Minguzzi\net al recognize that superfluidity can result even if there is no BEC.\nOther systems of interest include Fogler and Koulakov [66] who have compared the\nenergy of the Laughlin liquid and a charge density wave in a weak magnetic field. They\nconclude that after optimization of the CDW that it is lower in energy for Landau level\nnumbers N \uf0b3 2 at\uf06e N \uf03d 1 which agrees with experiment. Cox and others [67] have noted\n3\nthat a CDW coexisting with disorder may be important in manganite superstructures.\nCertainly the topological nature of QHE and the LCP-BKT bear closer scrutiny.\n6. Summary, Conclusions, and Proposals for Future Work.\n6.1 Summary. Based on earlier work, we have proposed a microscopic model for\ncuprate HTSC by relaxing the \"energy shell\" in Cooper's model ( \uf065 F \uf0b1 \uf077D ) [see\nAppendix]. This allows us to pursue a real space Cooper pair which we identify as the\n\"preformed pair.\" We suggest that these pairs form a BKT bound vortex which\ndissociates above Tc into circular CDW's. All of these structures are highly correlated.\nAs a function of temperature, doping and magnetic field strength, there seem to be at\nleast five distinct zones in the phase diagram. The model also offers an explanation of\nseveral disparate experimental observations \u2013 Nernst effect, bosons above Tc , electrons\nand vortices interacting, etc.\n\n15\n\n\f6.2 Conclusions. The model seems to have the ability to rationalize a number of widely\ndiffering experimental observations from STM and Nernst effects to \"local\nsuperconductivity persisting to zero temperature\" [8]. It also seems to have the ability to\npossibly explain several experimental and theoretical criteria that heretofore seemed\nbeyond reach such as the Uemura-Homes law and the density postulates of Turlakov and\nothers. Certainly a calculation of condensation energy would be helpful and with this\nmodel perhaps is can be calculated. It is intriguing that doping a LCP system, being a\nBKT vortex, is therefore a topological object; doping it leads to SC. Is this a general\nstatement?\nWhile the title refers solely to high Tc cuprates, there are relevant but limited comparisons\nwith (a) heavy-Fermion superconductors and (b) fullerides. The parallels of heavyFermion superconductor CeCoIn5 with high Tc cuprates are numerous: (i) the quasi-twodimensionality; (ii) the d-wave superconductivity; (iii) the appearance of\nsuperconductivity in the neighborhood of an antiferromagnetic state [68]. In the study of\nDora et. al. the large Nernst effect observed by R. Bel [69] above Tc 2.3K in CeCoIn5 is\ninterpreted in terms of an unconventional density wave (UDW) which is in evidence\naround T \uf03d 18K. Dora et al also offer an explanation of the temperature dependence of\nthe Seebeck coefficient below 18K in terms of a UDW.\nProposals for Future Work.\n1. The structures proposed can be readily solved numerically. It would be quite\ninteresting to insert some of these structures into one of the several sophisticated\nprograms to see if quantitative results can be obtained.\n2. It would be interesting to explore similar structure that appear in other materials which\nare not SC's; why?\n\nAppendix. \"Soft\" Cooper Pair Boson.\nOur initial notion of a CP was fixed by BCS theory approximations. A CP emerging\nfrom the continuum initially seemed to have a bit of mystery about its origin but bound\nstates emerging from the continuum have appeared elsewhere [59]) and there is a sound\nbasis [53].
