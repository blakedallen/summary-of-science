Ram pressure stripping principally effects the atomic gas in disk\ngalaxies, stripping away outer disk gas to a truncation radius. We demonstrate that the\ndrag force exerted on truncated gas disks is passed to the stellar disk, and surrounding\ndark matter through their mutual gravity. Using a toy model of ram pressure stripping,\nwe show that this can drag a stellar disk and dark matter cusp off centre within it's\ndark matter halo by several kiloparsecs. We present a simple analytical description of\nthis process that predicts the drag force strength and its dependency on ram pressures\nand disk galaxy properties to first order. The motion of the disk can result in temporary\ndeformation of the stellar disk. However we demonstrate that the key source of stellar\ndisk heating is the removal of the gas potential from within the disk. This can result\nin disk thickening by approximately a factor of two in gas-rich disks.\nKey words: methods: N-body simulations - galaxies: clusters: general - galaxies:\nevolution - galaxies: kinematics and dynamics - galaxies: intergalactic medium\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDynamical studies of the Virgo cluster reveal that it is\nfar from a relaxed structure, consisting of numerous subclouds apparently in the process of merging with each other\n(Gavazzi et al. 1999). As time evolves, clusters like Virgo\ngrow in mass by the accretion of field galaxies and galaxy\ngroups. Freshly accreted late-type disk galaxies face new environmental mechanisms, particular to the cluster environment, that can influence their evolution. The presence of a\nlow density, high temperature ionised gas, clearly visible in\nX-ray observations (Matsumoto et al. 2000), forms the basis of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Motion of a galaxy\nthrough this medium is thought to cause ram pressure stripping of a galaxy's atomic gas (Gunn & Gott 1972).\nStripping of atomic gas begins in a galaxy's outer disk,\nmigrates radially inwards, and only halts at a radius where\nthe galaxy's disk self-gravity is sufficient to maintain the disk\ngas against the ram pressure. This radius is often referred to\nas the 'truncation radius'. Observations of giant disk galaxies in the centre of the Virgo cluster support this notion,\nwith central disk galaxies displaying truncated atomic gas\n(HI) disks (Chung et al. 2008). Indeed, the degree by which\nthe disk is truncated is well correlated with the HI deficiency\nof the disk (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006) as would be expected\nin the ram pressure stripping scenario.\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:rsmith@astro-udec.cl\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nIn general, the influence of the intra-cluster medium is\nconsidered to primarily effect the diffuse, atomic gas component of late-type disk galaxies. The HI gas clouds have\na large enough cross-section to the ICM wind to be significantly effected by the ram pressure. Meanwhile, the cross\nsectional area of H2 clouds (Quilis et al. 2000) and stars are\nsimply too small to feel any signicant ram pressure directly\nfrom the ICM. The loss of the outer disk gas appears to halt\nstar formation at these radii - Koopmann et al. (2006) show\nthat galaxies that are deficient in HI, typically have smaller\nH\u03b1 disks. However the influence of ram pressure stripping\non the stellar dynamics of a disk galaxy is little discussed in\nthe literature.\nThe HI gas component of a disk galaxy must contribute\nto some degree to the potential of the disk. Therefore it's removal by ram pressure stripping might be expected to have\nsome influence on the stellar dynamics of the remaining stellar disk. However, typically the mass of a giant galaxy's gas\ndisk is a small fraction of their total disk mass, so stripping\nthe gas is not expected to strongly disturb the stellar disk.\nIn fact there have been few studies of the consequential\ninfluence of the ram pressure force on the other components\nof a galaxy. In the early ram pressure stripping simulations\nof Farouki & Shapiro (1980), the effect of removal of outer\ndisk gas on the stellar disk was considered. Here, the removal of the gas component from the outer disks of giant\nspirals resulted in mild thickening of the stellar disk as a\nresult of loss of disk potential. The effects were limited to\n\n\f2\n\nR.Smith et al\n\nthe outer disk as the surface density of these massive disk\ngalaxies prevented gas removal in their inner regions. Such\nmass-loss might be expected to cause disk expansion out of\nthe plane of the disk from both disk faces. This effect might\nbe expected to be stronger in lower mass late-type galaxies, who tend to contain much higher gas fractions within\ntheir disk. Lisker et al. (2007) also comments that 'signicant\nmass-loss due to stripping might effect the stellar configuration of galaxies'.\nSchulz & Struck (2001) reported a more uni-directional\neffect on the stellar disks of their model galaxies - the stellar\nand gas disk are reported to be dragged 2 kpc in the direction\nof the wind. They suggest that the off-centre position of their\ndisk places the gas disk under a compressive force, trapped\nbetween ram pressure on one side, and the restoring force of\nthe halo. This compressive force can result in the formation\nof flocculent spiral structure, and hence angular momentum\nloss, the net result of which can raise the gas density in\nthe inner disk, 'annealing' the galaxy to further stripping.\nSchulz & Struck (2001) focus primarily on the impact on the\ngas disk and little emphasis is placed on the impact on the\ndark matter component of their galaxy models.\nWe extend this study further, emphasising that not only\nthe stellar disk is dragged, but additionally the central dark\nmatter surrounding the disk also. Fujita (2006) note that\nif the gas disk is dragged, it is inevitable that this will be\ncommunicated to all components of the galaxy, by virtue of\ntheir mutual gravity.\nSchulz & Struck (2001) state that the stellar component\nof their models appears largely unaffected by being dragged\noff-centre. However we see evidence that the reduction in\ntotal disk mass by loss of the gas component results in disk\nthickening in our models. Furthermore, the motion of the\ndisk and central dark matter can temporarily disturb the\nstellar disk configuration causing a brief cone-like morphology.\nWe demonstrate that ram pressure dragging can result\nin significant displacement of the gas and stellar disk, and\ncentral dark matter during the infall of a galaxy into a cluster. We provide a simple analytical formulation of the force\nprovided by ram pressure dragging. We demonstrate that\nit predicts the drag force dependency on disk galaxy properties and ram pressures to first order by comparison with\nwind-tunnel tests.\nWe describe the numerical code, disk galaxy models,\nand ram pressure model in Section 2, we present our results\nfor a galaxy infall in Section 3.1, the analytical description\nand testing by wind-tunnel tests in Section 3.2, and impact\non stellar disk heating in Section 3.3, our discussion is in\nSection 4, and we draw conclusions in Section 5.\n\n2.1.1\n\nThe dark matter halo\n\nThe dark matter halos of all dwarf galaxy models presented\nin this work have an NFW density profile. The NFW profile\nhas the form:\n\u03c10\n\u03c1(R) = r\n(1)\n( rs )(1 + rrs )2\nwhere rs is a characteristic radial scale-length. The profile\nis truncated at the Virial radius, r200 = rs c. Here c is the\nconcentration parameter (Lokas & Mamon 2001). c is found\nto have a range of values in cosmological simulations, however there is a general trend for higher values in less massive\nsystems with some scatter - see Figure 8 in Navarro et al.\n(1996).\nPositions and velocities are assigned to the dark matter particles using the publically available algorithm mkhalo\nfrom the nemo repository (McMillan & Dehnen 2007). Dark\nmatter halos produced in this manner are evolved in isolation for 2.5 Gyr to test stability, and are found to be highly\nstable.\n\n2.1.2\n\nThe galaxy disks\n\nThe stellar and gas disk both have an exponential form\n\u03a3(R) = \u03a30 exp(R/Rd )\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the surface density, \u03a30 is central surface density,\nR is radius within the disk, and Rd is the scale-length of the\ndisk.\nThe size of the stellar scale-length of the disk is chosen\nfollowing the recipe of Mo et al. (1998). Here, the disk mass\nis a fixed fraction, md of the halo mass. Additionally we\nmust choose the spin parameter \u03bb. In the Mo et al. recipe,\nthis choice of parameters fully defines the scale-length of the\nstellar disk, Rd . For simplicity we assume the scale-length\nof the stellar disk and gas disk are equal.\nDisk particles are initially laid down in a plane in their\nexponential disk following Eq. 2. Real disks have finite thickness, but we cannot solve for this until we have defined the\nvelocity dispersion throughout the disk. A radially varying\nvelocity dispersion is chosen that ensures the disk is Toomre\nstable (Toomre 1964) at all radii . The Toomre stability criterion is defined as\n\u03ba\u03c3R\nQ\u2261\n>1\n(3)\n3.36G\u03a3\nwhere \u03a3 is the surface density, \u03c3R is the radial velocity dispersion, and \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency defined, using the\nepicyclic approximation (Springel & White 1999). Next we\nuse \u03c3\u03c62 =\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSETUP\nDisk galaxy models\n\nOur dwarf galaxy models consist of 3 components; an NFW\ndark matter halo (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996), an exponential disk of gas and one of stars. The methods used to\nform each component will be discussed briefly in the following sections. For a more in-depth description please see\nSmith et al. (2010).\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\u03c3R\n\u03b32\n\nwhere\n\u03b32 \u2261\n\n4 d\u03a6\n,\n\u03ba2 R dR\n\n(4)\n\nand \u03c6z = 0.6 * \u03c6R (Shlosman & Noguchi (1993)). This completely defines the minimum values of the necessary velocity dispersions throughout the disk. In practice, Q > 1.5\nis required throughout the stellar disk to ensure stability.\nThe gas disk has an intrinsic velocity dispersion, due to its\nisothermal nature, that automatically satisfies the Toomre\ncriteria at all radii.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\n2.2\n60\n\n-1\n\nCircular velocity (km s )\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\nTotal\nHalo only\nDisk only\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nRadius (kpc)\nFigure 1.

The value of the potential is calculated in thin spherical shells for the combined dark matter, stars and gas in\na one-off N-body calculation, including the effects of gravitational softening. This is necessary as the disks own selfgravity can influence the radial orbits of disk particles close\nto the centre of the halo. The gradient of the potential is\nthen used to calculate the circular velocity at each radius.\nAs a result inner disk particles have circular velocities raised\nbeyond that of the circular velocity of the halo alone at that\nradius.\n\n2.1.3\n\nSummary of disk galaxy parameters\n\nThe values of parameters defining our standard disk galaxy\nmodel can be summarised in the following; In all simulations our disk galaxy model has a dark matter halo mass of\n1010 M\u2299 , consisting of 100,000 dark matter particles, with\na concentration c = 20. Our standard model has md =0.05,\ntherefore has a total disk mass of 5.0\u00d7108 M\u2299 , and is formed\nfrom 50,000 equal mass particles. The stellar to gas ratio\nof the disk is unity unless otherwise specified. This creates\na gas-rich disk galaxy, although such a high gas fractions\nare not uncommon in low mass disk galaxies (Gavazzi et al.\n2008). We choose the spin parameter of our standard model\nas \u03bb=0.05 resulting in a stellar and gas disk scale length of\nRd = 0.73 kpc. The rotation curve of this galaxy is presented\nin Fig. 1.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n3\n\nThe Code\n\nIn this study we make use of 'gf' (Williams & Nelson\n2001,Williams 1998), which is a Tree code-SPH algorithm\nthat operates primarily using the techniques described in\nHernquist & Katz (1989). While the Tree code allows for\nrapid calculation of gravitational accelerations, the SPH\ncode allows us to include a HI gas component to our\ndwarf galaxy models. In all simulations, the gravitational\nsoftening length, \u01eb, is fixed for all particles at a value of\n100 pc, in common with the harassment simulations of\nMastropietro et al. (2005). Gravitational accelerations are\nevaluated to quadrupole order, using an opening angle\n\u03b8c =0.7. A second order individual particle time-step scheme\nwas utilised to improve efficiency following the methodology of Hernquist & Katz (1989). Each particle was assigned\na time-step that is a power of two division of the simulation block time-step, with a minimum time-step of \u223c5.0 yr.\nAssignment of time-steps for collisionless particles is controlled by the criteria of Katz (1991), whereas SPH particle\ntime-steps are assigned using the minimum of the gravitational time-step and the SPH Courant conditions with a\nCourant constant, C=0.1 (Hernquist & Katz 1989). As discussed in Williams et al. (2004), the kernel radius h of each\nSPH particle was allowed to vary such that at all times it\nmaintains between 30 and 40 neighbours within 2h. In order to realistically simulate shocks within the SPH model,\nthe artificial viscosity prescription of Gingold & Monaghan\n(1983) is used with viscosity parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (1,2). The\nequation of state for the gas component of the galaxies is\nisothermal with a bulk velocity dispersion of 8.0 km s\u22121 , in\nagreement with the measured velocity dispersion of molecular clouds in the local interstellar medium (Stark & Brand\n1989), and the observed HI velocity dispersion within a radius containing significant star formation in late-type disks\n(Tamburro et al. 2009). By choosing an isothermal equation of state, we are intrinsically assuming that stellar feedback processes are balanced by radiative cooling producing\na constant velocity dispersion. Such a model can be considered a first approximation to a detailed description of a\nmultiphase ISM that is unresolved in our models, and has\nbeen used previously in simulations of galaxy dynamics and\ngalaxy mergers (Theis & Hensler 1993, Mihos & Hernquist\n1994, Englmaier & Gerhard 1997). We do not include star\nformation in these models.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Ram Pressure Model\n\nThe Ram Pressure Stripping model is largely identical to\nthat presented in Vollmer et al. (2001). In this model, additional acceleration vectors are added to individual gas particles to mimic the ram pressure. A live ICM component is\nnot included. For an individual gas cloud, moving through\nthe ICM of density \u03c1ICM , with a velocity v, the pressure on\nits surface due to sweeping through the medium is assumed\nto be\nPram = \u03c1ICM v 2\n\n(7)\n\nIn order to calculate strength of the acceleration that\ngas clouds will feel as a result of ram pressure we follow\nVollmer et al. (2001). A constant column density is assumed\n\n\f4\n\nR.Smith et al\n\nfor each individual cloud. This has the advantage that the\nacceleration due to ram pressure is the same for all clouds,\ndisregarding their masses. A value of \u03a3cld = 7.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\nis used. This is comparable with measurements made by\nRots et al. (1990) and Crosthwaite et al. (2000) on nearby\nface-on galaxies. The acceleration due to ram pressure can\ntherefore be written as\n\naram =\n\nPram\nmH \u03a3cld\n\n(8)\n\nwhere mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom. In the galaxy\nmodel's frame of reference, the effect of its motion through\nthe ICM is that of a ICM wind of velocity v and density\n\u03c1ICM . aram therefore always acts in the direction of the velocity vector of the wind.\nOnce more following Vollmer et al. (2001), a shading\ncriteria is used to select gas particles that feel the influence of ram pressure, and gas particles that are shielded by\nother gas particles upstream in the wind. In the simulation,\ngas particles are point particles and therefore have no crosssection by which to shield other particles. However, we can\ncalculate a particles cloud radius rcld if we know its mass mp\nand once more assume it has the column density \u03a3cld . Then\nrcld = [mp /(\u03c0mH \u03a3cld )]0.5 . In practice, each particle extends\nan imaginary vector along the direction of motion of the\ngalaxy's disk and checks to see if any other particles cross2\nsections (\u03c0rcld\n) cross the vector. If there are none, then the\ngas particle is unshielded and will feel the acceleration aram .\nIn this case, an additional acceleration vector of magnitude\naram is added to the particle's equation of motion, in the\ndirection of the ICM wind.\nWe emphasise that this model should be regarded as\na toy model of ram pressure. Recent ram pressure stripping models discussed in the literature (see for example\nRoediger & Br\u00fcggen 2007) have advanced significantly beyond the simple ram pressure recipe of Vollmer et al. (2001).\nIncreasingly high resolution along the ISM-ICM boundary\nhas allowed quantification of additional stripping mechanisms such as Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities and KelvinHelmholtz (KH) stripping. The ICM gas is normally composed of a live gas component that can form a shock front\nwhen a galaxy reaches supersonic velocities. Typically these\nstudies concentrate on highest possible resolution of the gas\ncomponent of their disk galaxies, using analytical static potentials to treat the gravitational influence of the dark matter halo and stellar disk.\nOur toy model does not include a live ICM gas component, so physically does not include the effects of RT instabilities or KH stripping. However, the toy model presented is\nfast, enabling wider parameter searches to be conducted and\nallowing us to include a live dark matter halo and live stellar disk component in our galaxy models. We will show that\nthis is crucial to the results of this study. We demonstrate\nin the following section that despite it's simplicity, the toy\nmodel can reasonably reproduce the evolution of the HI disk\ntruncation radius in the same manner seen in significantly\nmore complex ram pressure simulations. This requirement\nis important to the conclusions of our study.\nFor reasons that will become clear in Section 3, we clarify that additional accelerations due to ram pressure are\napplied purely to the gas component of our galaxy models.\n\n2.3.1\n\nTesting the ram pressure model\n\nDespite the large variety of ram pressure stripping models previously implemented in the literature, it has frequently been found that the Gunn & Gott condition (Eq.\n9) can successfully predict the truncation radius Rtrc (the\nradius to which the gas disk is stripped) to first order\nas long as the disk is not close to an edge-on inclination to the wind (Abadi et al. 1999, Vollmer et al. 2002,\nMayer 2005, J\u00e1chym et al. 2007, Roediger & Br\u00fcggen 2007).\nWithin Rtrc , the self-gravity of the disk can overcome the\nram pressure force.\nThe Gunn & Gott condition is\n\u03c1ICM v 2 => 2\u03c0G\u03c3\u22c6 (r)\u03c3g (r),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere v is the galaxy's velocity through the ICM, \u03c3g is the\ngas surface density of the galaxy, and \u03c3\u22c6 is the stellar surface\ndensity of the galaxy. The left hand side of Eq. 9 represents\nthe removal force due to ram pressure stripping. The right\nhand side represents the restoring force of the disk's gravitational potential. Hence when the disk is close to face-on\ninclination to the wind, the self-restoring force of the disk\nhas vectors in the opposite direction from the removal force\nof ram pressure stripping, and the Gunn & Gott criteria is\nbest satisfied.\nAbadi et al. (1999) showed that the halo and bulge components of a galaxy may provide additional restoring force\non the gas disk of the galaxy. For the halo this was found to\nbe negligible, except in the outer disk. However, for galaxies with prominent bulges, the restoring force can be significantly enhanced in the central regions of disk. For our\nbulgeless disk galaxy models, we will demonstrate that Eq.\n9 is sufficient.\nUsing Eq. 9, the predicted truncation radius for a bulgeless galaxy with an exponential disk can be written:\n\nRtrc = \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\nR\u22c6\nRg\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nln\n\n\u0014\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1ICM v 2 Rg2 R\u22c62\nGm\u22c6 mg\n\n\u0015\n\n(10)\n\nwhere R\u22c6 and Rg are scalelengths of the stellar and gas disk\nrespectively, and m\u22c6 and mg are the total masses of the\nstellar and gas disk respectively.\nWe use the predicted Rtrc of the disk gas from Eq. 10 to\ntest our ram pressure model in face-on ram pressure stripping simulations. This is more easily accomplished by fixing\na constant velocity for the test galaxy and for the density of\nthe ICM it is moving through. We refer to such tests, whose\nram pressure is constant and unchanging as 'wind-tunnel'\ntests. It should be noted that this situation is artificial for\nreal galaxies whose infall into a cluster which are subjected\nto both changing wind velocities and densities (discussed\nfurther in Section 2.4).\nWe choose an arbitrary fixed ICM density of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\u22123\ncm , corresponding to an intermediate density in the Virgo\ncluster. For example, a galaxy would encounter such densities at \u223c 600 kpc from the cluster centre, assuming the\nreasonable \u03b2-model used for cluster infall tests in this study\n(described in full in Section 2.4). We subject our standard\ngalaxy model to an ICM wind of constant velocity v with a\nface-on inclination. v is varied from 300-4000 km s\u22121 where\ncomplete stripping is predicted at 3500 km s\u22121 . For a comc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\n\nfaces strong time-evolution of the ram pressure. The density of the ICM rises significantly with decreasing radius\nwithin the cluster. Additionally, the gravitational potential\nwell of the cluster causes a galaxy to have highest orbital\nvelocity through the densest ICM, when at the pericentre of\nthe orbit. Therefore ram pressure is expected to be strongly\npeaked close to pericentre. Hence the evolution of the ram\npressure depends on the shape of the ICM density profile,\nand the potential well of the cluster. Under the assumption\nthat the ICM gas is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well of the cluster, and the gas\nhas negligible contribution to the cluster potential well, the\nfollowing equation holds:\n\n2\n\nModel truncation radius (kpc)\n\n300\n\n500\n\n1.5\n\n750\n\n1\n1250 1000\n\n1500\n\n0.5\n2000\n\n0\n\n3500\n4000\n\n0\n\n1750\n\n2500 2250\n3000\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\na(r) = \u2212\n\n2\n\nPredicted truncation radius rtrc (kpc)\nFigure 2. Comparison between the analytically predicted gas\ndisk truncation radius using the Gunn & Gott Equation (x-axis),\nand the measured gas disk truncation radius of the model (yaxis). The dashed line marks a one-to-one agreement. In general\nthe agreement is reasonable. The numbers labelling each point\nrepresent the ICM wind velocity v used for that wind tunnel test.\nThe hatched area marks the region in which gravity is not fully\nresolved in the model.\n\nplete list of the wind-tunnel tests used with the standard\nmodel, see the upper entry of Tab. 1.\nThe model galaxy is subjected to the ICM wind for\n0.75 Gyr. This duration is chosen as it allows sufficient\ntime for gas that has been unbound to be accelerated away\nfrom the stellar disk, at which point the gas truncation\nradius is measured. The duration is also physically motivated. Trentham & Tully (2002) give the crossing time of\nthe Virgo cluster as one tenth of a Hubble time. Therefore\n0.75 Gyr represents a rough time-scale for which a Virgo\ncluster galaxy might experience significant ram pressures.\nA comparison between the analytical predicted Rtrc of\nEquation 10, and the measured gas truncation radius is\nshown in Fig. 2. The hatched area marks the region in which\ngravity is not fully resolved in the model. In general the\nmodel matches the predicted truncation radius reasonably\nwell, although there may be some over-stripping as we approach the resolution limit.\nWe see little indication of the under-stripping that\nmight be expected if the dark matter halo of our model\nwas substantially contributing to the restoring gravitational\nforce of the galaxy acting on the gas disk against ram pressure. This supports our use of Eqn. 10 to predict the gas\ntruncation radius.\n\n2.4\n\n5\n\nA cluster model\n\nFrom Eq. 7, the instantaneous ram pressure that a gas cloud\nfeels is a function of both the velocity of the cloud, and the\ndensity of the ICM it moves through at that instant. In\nSection 3, we refer to wind-tunnel tests. In these highly idealised tests, the ICM density \u03c1ICM , and ICM wind velocity v\nis fixed, producing a constant and unevolving ram pressure\non a galaxy model's disk of magnitude \u03c1ICM v 2 .\nInstead, a galaxy that orbits in a real galaxy cluster\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nkB T d\nln(\u03c1ICM )\n\u03bcmp dr\n\n(11)\n\nwhere a(r) is the acceleration due to the potential well\nat radius r, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the isothermal\ngas temperature, \u03bc is the mean molecular mass (assumed\nequal to 0.6), mp is the mass of a proton, and \u03c1ICM is the\ndensity profile of the ICM. For \u03c1ICM , we assume a \u03b2-profile:\n\u0012\n\u0013(\u22123/2)\u03b2\nr2\n\u03c1ICM (r) = \u03c10 1 + 2\nrICM\n\n(12)\n\nFollowing the cluster model C1 in Roediger & Br\u00fcggen\n(2007), we assume T = 4.7 \u00d7 107 K, \u03c10 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221226 g cm\u22123 ,\n\u03b2 = 0.5, and rICM is 50 kpc. As noted in the same Roediger & Bruggen paper, this is similar to the Virgo cluster\n(Matsumoto et al. 2000), but less centrally concentrated.\nThis fully defines the cluster model's gravitational potential well, and the radial dependence of ICM densities.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nA galaxy infall within the cluster\n\nAs previously discussed, the ram pressure experienced by a\ngalaxy infalling into a cluster is a strong function of time.\nWe model the changing ram pressure in the same manner\nas Vollmer et al. (2001).\nThe ram pressure wind is assumed to be monodirectional throughout the galaxy's orbit in the cluster. This\nis idealised, but for the plunging orbits we consider, the\ngalaxy trajectory near the cluster centre are quasi-linear,\nand for now we wish to restrict our study to purely face-on\nstripping (i.e. the wind is inclined orthogonal to the plane\nof the disk).\nUsing a single particle integrator, we calculate orbits\nwithin the cluster potential well. Initially the particle is positioned at 1.5 Mpc from the cluster centre, at an initial radius where the ICM density is very low resulting in initially\nnegligible ram pressure. We arbitarily choose the particle's\ninitial velocity vector such that it has a 400 km s\u22121 radially\ninwards component and a 150 km s\u22121 tangential component. This results in a plunging orbit. The evolution of ram\npressure, radius within the cluster, and orbital velocity that\nwould result from this orbit can be seen in Fig. 3.\nThe galaxy model is then located at the origin in simulation space, and is subjected to a time-evolving ram pressure\nmatching that of the upper panel in Fig. 3. We note that\n\n\f6\n\nR.Smith et al\n4e-10\n\nsiderably less gas-rich than the standard model, with a gas\nfraction matching massive late-type galaxies (Gavazzi et al.\n2008).\n\n-3\n\nRam Pressure (erg cm )\n\n3.5e-10\n3e-10\n2.5e-10\n2e-10\n1.5e-10\n1e-10\n5e-11\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nDistance to cluster centre (kpc)\n\nTime (Myr)\n\n1500\n\nThe key point to note is throughout the infall into the\ncluster the stellar disk and remaining gas disk of the galaxy\nis dragged away from it's original location in the direction\nof the wind (marked with a cross symbol in the panels of\nFig. 4). At 3.0 Gyr, the stellar disk has been shifted \u223c 4.5\nkpc. Comparing with the right column, it can be seen that\nthe central dark matter surrounding the stellar disk is also\nram pressure dragged. The central cusp of the dark matter\nhalo remains superimposed on the location of the stellar disk\nand remaining gas disk, but is also offset from it's original\nlocation by \u223c 4.5 kpc.\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nTime (Myr)\n\n3000\n\n2500\n-1\n\nOrbital velocity (km s )\n\nIn Fig. 4 we plot x-z projections of the evolution of the\nstellar and gas component; dark (black) and light (green)\nparticles respectively in left panel), and the dark matter\n(dark (black) particles in right panel). The ram pressure\nwind blows towards positive z in these figures. Initially ram\npressure is weak when the galaxy is at low velocities and in\nthe low density ICM regime. After 0.5 Gyr (the second row),\nthe gas disk is mildly truncated to \u223c 2 \u2212 3 kpc. Stripped gas\nis blown in the direction of the wind creating a conical tail of\nstripped gas. At 1.4 Gyr (the third row), the model is near\nto orbit pericentre and is moving rapidly through a dense\nICM. The gas disk is heavily truncated, with gas remaining\nin the inner \u223c 0.3 kpc only. After 3.0 Gyr the model has\neffectively passed orbit pericentre, is entirely stripped of its\ngas, and has returned to the outskirts of the cluster.\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\nDark matter in the outer halo appears largely unaffected and remains spherical, and centred on its original\nlocation. However the inner regions of the halo have been\ndragged off-centre with respect to the outer halo. In Fig. 5\nwe show a grey-scale surface-density plot of the dark matter halo at 3.0 Gyr (corresponding to snapshot in the bottom panel of Fig. 4). We overlay the grey-scale image with\nsurface-density contours (light/magenta curves) at 50, 10, 5,\n1, 0.3, and 0.1 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Centred on the original location\nof the halo, we additionally mark circles (black) with radii\nof 0.6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 kpc. This demonstrates the extent\nto which the originally spherical halo has been deformed.\nThe outer halo (r > 36 kpc) appears largely unaffected. At\nintermediate radius (r \u223c24 kpc) a halo deformation, in the\ndirection of the ram pressure wind (towards the top of the\nfigure), becomes apparent. The extent of the deformation\nincreases with decreasing radius, and is most apparent in\nthe inner 12 kpc of the halo.\n\nTime (Myr)\nFigure 3.

Comparing the final stellar disk to the initial stellar\ndesk in Figure 4, there is a hint of mild disk thickening, although in this case it is not significant. This indicates that\ndark matter potential well surrounding the disk has not been\nheavily altered, as the disk remains largely unaffected. In the\nfollowing section we concentrate on explaining and understanding the dragging of the stellar disk and surrounding\ndark matter by ram pressure. We return to the issue of stellar disk thickening in a later section.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nz (kpc)\n\nz (kpc)\n\n6\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n-6\n-9\n\n-5\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n-6\n-9\n\n9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nx (kpc)\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nz (kpc)\n\nz (kpc)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n0\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-5\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n-6\n-9\n\n9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nx (kpc)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (kpc)\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nz (kpc)\n\nz (kpc)\n\n0\n\n6\n\n5\n\n-2\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-6\n-9\n\n-6\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nx (kpc)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (kpc)\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nz (kpc)\n\nz (kpc)\n\n-1\n\nx (kpc)\n\n6\n\n-6\n-9\n\n7\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n-6\n-9\n\n-6\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (kpc)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx (kpc)\n\nFigure 4.

The outer halo remains largely unaffected.\nThis figure is 120 kpc on each side. A colour version is available\nonline.\n\n3.2\n\nA simple analytical description\n\nWe are not the first to note that ram pressure can result\nin dragging of the stellar disk of a galaxy undergoing ram\npressure. Schulz & Struck (2001) report that the stellar disk\nof their galaxy model is dragged by 2 kpc. Considering an\nannular region in the outer part of the disk, they suggest the\ngas disk in this annulus is analogous to a solar sail, which is\ndragging a payload - the stellar disk. We offer an alternative\nbut complimentary approach to an analytical understanding\nof ram pressure drag. As we will demonstrate, our approach\nprovides us with the drag force directly, and predicts it's\ndependency on ram pressure strength and disk properties.\nFirst let us assume a galaxy model containing a dark\nmatter halo, and exponential disk of gas and stars. The gas\ndisk has mass mg and scalelength Rg . The stellar disk has\nmass m\u22c6 and scalelength R\u22c6 . We now assume that the galaxy\nis in motion through an ICM of density \u03c1ICM , at a constant\nvelocity v.\nIn this scenario, according to the Gunn and Gott criteria the gas disk will be truncated to the truncation radius\nRtrc given by Eqn. 10. At this radius the self-restoring gravity of the galaxy is sufficient to maintain the gas against the\nram pressure.\nThe remaining gas disk is subjected to a continuous\nforce that is simply the product of the pressure of the wind\nwith the area of the disk: Fdrag = \u03c1ICM v 2 A where A is the\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\nR\u22c6\nRg\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nln\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1ICM v 2 Rg2 R\u22c62\nGm\u22c6 mg\n\n\u0013 \u00152\n\n.\n\n(13)\nTo stop the remaining gas disk accelerating away, the\ngalaxy must have sufficient self-gravity to overcome the ram\npressure. The central halo, stellar disk and remaining gas\ndisk of the galaxy provide sufficient gravitational force to\naccomplish this. However from Newton's third law, it is inevitable that in providing this restoring force, these components of the galaxy must also feel an equal and opposite\nforce in the direction of the wind.\nIn other words, the drag force on the truncated gas disk\ndoes not disappear, simply because the gas disk is held in\nplace by the self-gravity of the galaxy. Instead it is passed to\nall components of the galaxy through their mutual gravity.\nThe communication of the drag force to the stellar disk and\ndark matter of a galaxy is also discussed in Fujita (2006) if the gas disk is dragged, both the dark matter and stellar\ndisk will pull back.\nThe ram pressure drag effect could not have been seen\nin numerical models of ram pressure that assume a fixed,\nstatic analytical potential for the dark matter and stellar\ndisk component of their model disk galaxies. Ram pressure\ndrag of dark matter and stellar disks occurs because in a\nlive dark matter, the halo must respond to the applicaton of\nadditional forces. Given sufficient time, the continuous drag\nforce of ram pressure can cause sufficient acceleration of the\ncentral dark matter to pull it off centre as demonstrated in\nFig. 5.\nEq. 13 provides a simple quantification of the size of\nFdrag for an exponential disk of gas and stars. However the\nresulting response of the central dark matter to this forcing\nis difficult to predict using only simple analytical considerations. The degree of acceleration of the central cusp will\nlikely depend on the mass of dark matter that is effected by\nram pressure drag. Furthermore, an offcentre cusp within\nan unaffected outer halo must feel additional restoring forces\nfrom the outer halo. It's resulting motion to the ram pressure\ndrag force is unlikely to have a simple analytical solution.\nFor this reason, we rely on numerical simulations to quantify the effect of ram pressure drag on the stellar disk and\ncentral dark matter halo displacement.\nHowever, using the numerical simulations, we will\ndemonstrate how Eq. 13 appears to successfully predict, to\nfirst order, the drag force and its dependency on ram pressure strength and disk properties.\n\n3.3\n\nWind-tunnel tests on the standard model\n\nWe subject the standard model galaxy to wind-tunnel tests\nin the same manner as described in Section 2.3.1, and assuming the same moderate ICM density (5.0\u00d710\u22124 cm\u22123 ).\nThe dark matter, stellar disk and remaining gas disk\nare seen to always remain superimposed in our models (for\nexample, see Fig. 4). Therefore by measuring the location\nof the centre-of-mass of the stellar disk, we simultaneously\nmeasure the displacement by which the central halo dark\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\n\n5\n-1\n\n4.5\n\n300 km s\n-1\n750 km s\n-1\n1250 km s\n-1\n1750 km s\n-1\n3000 km s\n\nCusp displacement (kpc)\n\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nTime (Gyr)\nFigure 6. Time-evolution of the 'cusp displacement' - the position of the cusp, stellar disk and remaining gas disk with respect\nto their original position. Wind-tunnel ram pressure simulations\nare used with a range of wind-speeds (as indicated in the key). At\nlow and high ram pressures, the cusp and disk is less significantly\ndragged. There exists a range of ram pressures, at intermediate\nwind speeds, when cusp and disk dragging occurs the most.\n\nmatter and the stellar disk have been dragged away from\ntheir initial location at the centre of the dark matter halo.\nHerein, we shall refer to the size of this displacement as\nthe 'cusp displacement', although it should be remembered\nthat it is also the displacement of the stellar and remaining\ngas disk away from their original position.\nInitially the outer halo dark matter is unaffected by\ncusp dragging and remains spherically symmetric. Therefore\ncusp displacement can be regarded as the distance that the\ncentral dark matter cusp (and disk) moves off-centre with\nrespect to the outer halo.\nIn Fig. 6, we plot the time evolution of cusp displacement. Each curve represents a specified ICM wind velocity.\nAt 300 km s\u22121 , the cusp displacement slowly but steadily\ngrows with time. After 0.75 Gyr, the total cusp displacement\nis 1.25 kpc. At 750 km s\u22121 , cusp displacement occurs more\nrapidly, with a larger final cusp displacement. Peak displacement occurs between wind velocities \u223c1000-1500 km s\u22121 . At\nv=1250 km s\u22121 total cusp displacement is \u223c4.0 kpc after\n0.75 Gyr. As the wind velocity is increased further, the final\ncusp displacement does not increase further, and begins to\ndrop.\nAs we will show, our analytical expression for the drag\nforce shown in Eq. 13 qualitatively predicts this behaviour.\nFor clarity, we repeat that Fdrag = \u03c1ICM v 2 A where A is\nthe area of the disk. At sufficiently high ram pressures, it is\ntherefore inevitable that the area of the gas disk will become\nsufficiently small that the drag force upon it must decrease .\nAs an extreme case, a galaxy undergoing very high ram pressures that completely strip the gas, will no longer present\nany surface area to the wind. At this point Fdrag \u2192 0. It is\ntherefore predicted that the drag force on this disk will peak\nat some intermediate value of ram pressure; between a low\npressure that allows a large gas disk area but is too weak\nto result in strong dragging, and a high ram pressure that\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n9\n\nreduces the gas disk area so much, that there is in sufficent\narea on which the ram pressure can act.\nUsing Eq. 13, for the standard model we can calculate\nthe value of Fdrag for varying ram pressures (for the fixed\nICM density of the wind-tunnel tests, simply varying the\nICM wind speed, is equivalent to varying the ram pressure).\nThis is plotted as the solid line in Fig. 7.\nA peak in the drag force is predicted for wind velocities between \u223c1000-1500 km s\u22121 . At wind velocities smaller\nor larger than this value, the drag force is expected to decrease. As mentioned in the previous section, a knowledge\nof the drag force on central dark matter does not necessarily\ndirectly translate into predictions of how the cusp will move\nunder this forcing. However the cusp displacement indeed\npeaks near 1000 km s\u22121 where the drag force is predicted\nto peak. At velocities greater than 1750 km s\u22121 or lower\nthan 750 km s\u22121 , the cusp displacement lowers, in the same\nqualitative manner as the drag force is predicted to lower.\nIt is interesting to note the initial motion of the cusp\nat wind speeds significantly beyond the predicted peak drag\nforce. For example, see the v = 3000 km s\u22121 curve on Fig.\n6. Initially cusp motion is fast at high ram pressures, then\ntapers off. This behaviour is indicative of the finite time\nrequired for stripped gas to be accelerated away from the\nstellar disk in the galaxy models (see Roediger & Br\u00fcggen\n(2007) for a more complete discussion of this phonomena).\nThe standard Gunn and Gott stripping criteria assumes instantaneous stripping of any gas located at disk annuli where\nthe self-gravity of the disk weaker than the ram pressure.\nHowever, in reality this process is not instantaneous, and\nduring this period, the stellar disk and dark matter halo is\nsubjected to heightened drag forces until the gas disk has\nbeen stripped to it's final truncation radius. As our formulation of Fdrag in Eq. 13 is derived from the instantaneous\nGunn and Gott Equation, it does not account for this initial\nburst of strong dragging, that appears most significant at\nhigh ram pressures.\n\n3.4\n3.4.1\n\nDependency of dragging on disk galaxy\nproperties\nAnalytical predictions\n\nSo far we have only considered the effects of ram pressure\ndrag on a single fixed galaxy model. Now we consider alternative disk galaxy models. In all the following disk galaxy\nmodels, we restrict our study to that of a 1010 M\u2299 dark matter halo of equal mass to that of the standard model.\nWe first consider a 'heavy disk' model. For this model,\nthe disk matches that of the standard model except it's mass\nis doubled. Therefore in this model, the disk mass is 10% of\nthe dark matter halo mass.\nWe also consider a 'small disk' model. In this case, the\ndisk matches the standard model except it's exponential\nscalelength is reduced from 0.73 kpc to 0.56 kpc. In the\nMo et al. (1998), this is predicted if the spin parameter \u03bb is\nchosen to be 0.04. In cosmological simulations, \u03bb is found to\nhave a log-normal distribution that peaks near to 0.05 and\nhas a range varying from 0.02 to 0.08. Therefore our choice\nof \u03bb for the 'small disk' model is entirely reasonable.\nWe also consider two disk models that are identical to\nthe standard model except we vary the gas-to-stellar mass\n\n\f3.4.2\n\nWind tunnel tests\n\nHaving discussed the analytical predictions for drag forces\nfor each disk model, we now test the actual response of each\nmodel to ram pressure drag using the toy model of ram\npressure. We use wind tunnel tests matching those used in\nthe previous section, but this time applied to our new disk\nmodels. Once more, we measure the cusp displacement in\neach wind tunnel test over a period of 0.75 Gyr. We remind\nthe reader that the cusp displacement is the distance at\nwhich the dark matter halo cusp, stellar disk and remaining\ngas disk are dragged away from their original location.\nFor these tests we subject each galaxy to different wind\nspeeds; slow (1000 km s\u22121 ), medium (1500 km s\u22121 ), and\nfast (2000 km s\u22121 ). The results are presented in Fig. 8. We\nindicate the wind speed with a 'F' (fast),'M' (medium), or 'S'\n(slow) at the end of each curve on this figure. For reference,\na summary of all the wind tunnel tests conducted in this\npaper is provided in Tab. 1.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 8 shows the standard model\nversus the small disk, and reduced gas fraction models. It is\nanalytically predicted (see Fig. 7) that the small disk will\nsuffer similar drag forces as the standard model at the slow\n\nstandard model\nHeavy disk\nSmall disk\ng/s=0.3\ng/s=0.1\n\n0\n\n5e+10\n\n1e+11\n\n2 -2\n-1\n\nof their disks. Both are significantly less gas-rich than the\nstandard model which contains equal gas to stellar mass.\nThe 'g/s=0.3' model has a disk that is 76% stars and 24%\ngas. The 'g/s=0.1' model has a disk that is 90% stars and\n10% gas. Note that 'g/s' refers to the mass ratio of gas to\nstars in their disk. The 'g/s=0.1' model is identical to that\nused in the cluster infall simulation described in Section 2.4.\nFinally, we consider a 'low concentration' model, in\nwhich the model is identical to that of the standard model,\nexcept the dark matter halo is significantly less concentrated\nwith c = 5. The ranges of halo concentrations found in cosmological dark matter simulations are found to follow a scattered trend towards higher concentrations in lower mass halos (Lokas & Mamon 2001). A concentration of c = 5 is reasonable within the significant scatter observed in this trend.\nThe analytical prediction for the magnitude of the drag\nforce in each of these galaxy models, including the standard\nmodel is shown on Fig. 7, as indicated in the key. It should\nbe noted that the standard model and the low concentration\nmodel share the same curve, as their disk properties are identical. The heavy disk model is predicted to feel the strongest\ndrag force for the whole range of wind velocities considered.\nAdditionally, it's peak drag force occurs at much higher wind\nvelocity than the standard model. The small disk model has\na higher surface density than the standard model. At high\nwind velocities, this results in a prediction of stronger ram\npressure drag force than the standard model. However at\nwind velocities < 1000 km s\u22121 , their drag forces should be\ncomparable. As might be intuitively expected, lowering the\ngas fraction of this disk should result in weaker drag forces\n- the mass that tows the stellar disk and halo cusp has been\nreduced. The difference between predicted drag forces of the\nstandard model and the low gas fraction models becomes\nmore prominent at higher wind velocities. The lower the\ngas fraction, the more easily the disk is stripped to small\ntruncation radii (or altogether). This results in a peak drag\nforce that occurs at lower wind velocities with decreasing\ngas fraction.\n\n1.5e+11\n\nR.Smith et al\n\nDrag force Fdrag (Msol kpc km s )\n\n10\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n-1\n\nVelocity (km s )\nFigure 7.

The smaller disk model is\npredicted to have similar drag forces at low wind speeds, but increasingly stronger drag forces at higher wind speeds.

A complete list of all wind-tunnel tests conducted in\nthis study, and the model galaxies they were conducted on\n\nwind velocity. However as the wind velocity is increased beyond this, the small disk will suffer increasing larger drag\nforces than the standard model. To first order, the magnitude of cusp displacement appears to follow strength of the\npredicted drag force. There is similar cusp displacement at\nlow and medium wind velocities, but larger cusp displacement for the strong wind case. Comparing the low gas fraction models with the standard model, we see reduced cusp\nmotion with reducing gas fraction. This is also expected as\nreduced gas fraction results in reduced disk drag at all velocities.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 8 shows the standard model\nversus the heavy disk and low concentration model. We first\ndiscuss the comparison between the standard model and the\nheavy disk. It is analytically predicted (see Fig. 7) that the\nheavy disk suffers significantly stronger drag forces at all\nwind velocities.

Once more, a stronger predicted drag force\nresults in a relatively greater cusp displacement.\nIn the low concentration halo test, the reduced concentration of the halo reduces the mass of dark matter surrounding the disk. This effectively reduces the analogous\npayload that the gas disk must drag. This results in an initial motion of the cusp that moves more rapidly than the\nstandard model. For the fast wind, this results in a final\ncusp displacement that is greater than the standard model.\n\n3.4.3\n\nLimitations of the analytical treatment\n\nHowever, when the gas disk is not truncated in the manner\npredicted by the Gunn & Gott formula, an increase in predicted drag force does not always result in an increase in the\nactual cusp displacement meaured in the model.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\nFor example, we note that the heavy disk is predicted\nto suffer increasingly strong drag forces, in comparison to\nthe standard model, up to 2000 km s\u22121 and beyond. In the\nheavy disk simulation the fastest wind in fact causes the\nleast cusp displacement. Also in the low concentration test\nfor the medium and slow wind, the increased dragging due to\nreduced dark-matter mass about the disk is short-lived, and\nthe final cusp displacement is similar to that of the standard\nmodel.\nIn these cases, the true ram pressure drag force is likely\nto be less than the predicted analytical drag force. The ram\npressure drag force can become very sensitive to small deviations from the predicted truncation radius Rtrc when the\nreal truncation radius is small. For example, the standard\nmodel has a predicted Rtrc = 0.41 kpc for the strong wind.\nFig. 2 demonstrates that our simple ram pressure model can\nresult in a real truncation radius \u223c0.1 kpc smaller. As Fdrag\n2\nis proportional to the area of the truncated disk A= \u03c0Rtrc\n,\na reduction of only 0.1 kpc in the truncation of the gas disk\nresults in a drag force that is almost halved.\nFurthermore, the real response of the model's gas disk\nto strong forcing may not be as idealised an in the Gunn &\nGott formulation. Schulz & Struck (2001) note that while\nthe gas disk is dragging the stellar disk (and central dark\nmatter) it effectively feels an increased surface density. In\nthe simulations, we see that this can result in enhanced disk\nbarring. Bar enhancement occurs for all the disk models but\nis especially strong for the heavy disk and low concentration\nmodel. The bars are dense, and reduce the cross-sectional\narea of the disk to the wind. Therefore the analytically predicted drag force may be too small. Also the disk crosssectional area can become far from circular in shape once\nthe outer gas is stripped to the perimeter of the bar, whereas\na circular cross-section to the wind is intrinsically assumed\nin Eq. 13.\nThe extent to which barring occurs is expected to be\ndependent on the stability of a given model to Toomre instability. For example, the heavy disk model contains a gas\ndisk that is closer to being Toomre unstable due to the high\n\n\f12\n\nR.Smith et al\n0.6\n0.4\n\nz (kpc)\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nx (kpc)\n\n1\n0.8\n\nz (kpc)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nx (kpc)\n\n1.6\n1.4\n\nz (kpc)\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nx (kpc)\n\n2.2\n\nz (kpc)\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nx (kpc)\n\n3.4\n3.2\n\nz (kpc)\n\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nx (kpc)\n\nFigure 10. Snapshots of the dynamical influence of a ram pressure wind tunnel test (v=1750 km s\u22121 ) on the stellar disk of the standard\nmodel. For clarity, we do not include the gas particles in these panels, although in the simulation, gas is blown in a positive z-direction.\nAdditionally, we present only a 0.5 kpc wide cross section of the stellar disk to emphasise the disk shape. The length of the axes is equal\nin all snapshot. From top to bottom, instant of snapshot is 0, 100, 200, 300 and 700 Myr of the wind-tunnel conditions. At 100 Myr, a\nconical distortion can be seen. At 200 Myr, the disk has almost returned to a flat shape, although at 300 Myr it has slightly over-shot\nbeing flat, and a milder inverted cone is visible. By 700 Myr, the disk is fully restabilised. Comparing the 0 Myr and 700 Myr snap shot,\nthe final disk is clearly more thickened.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\nsurface density of the disk. A massive dark matter halo provides stability to a disk, increasing it's Toomre stability parameter. However in the reduced concentration model, the\ndisk is naturally closer to being Toomre unstable due to a\nreduced mass of dark matter surrounding the disk. Therefore the increased effective surface density that the gas disk\nexperiences during ram pressure could result in more significant barring, and it is understandable that this is strongest\nfor the heavy disk and low concetration model.\nSchulz & Struck (2001) use a more detailed treatment\nof the inter-stellar medium than our own, including a prescription for radiative cooling. They note that the increased\neffective surface density, that the gas disks of their models\nfeel, results in the development of flocculent spiral structure.\nThis spiral structure transfers angular momentum away\nfrom their disks, resulting in the gas disk being 'annealed' to\nfurther ram pressure stripping. Additionally they comment\nthat this behaviour requires a treatment of radiative cooling.\nWe are not confident that we can describe the detailed gas\ndynamics and bar formation sufficiently realistically to draw\nfirm conclusions using our simple isothermal model. We do\nnot observe the development of floculent spiral structure,\nthough Schulz & Struck (2001) state that this behaviour requires a treatment of radiative cooling. However we note\nthat the heavy barring observed in the heavy disk and small\ndisk model will induce angular momentum loss that could\nresult in a more compact disk.\nIn Figure 9 we plot the cusp displacement at 0.75 Myr\nof the wind tunnel tests. We include points for all simulations where the truncation radius was fully resolved (Rtrc >\n0.2 kpc). We see the trend that might be expected - with\nincreasing drag force there is increasing cusp displacement.\nHowever, the trend between dragging force and cusp\ndisplacement is not linear (note the logarithmic scale on the\nx-axis). As suspected, the resulting response of the central\ndark matter to this forcing cannot be calculated trivially.\nThe degree of acceleration of the central cusp must depend\non the mass of dark matter that is effected by ram pressure drag. Furthermore, an offcentre cusp within an unaffected outer halo must feel additional restoring forces from\nthe outer halo. Therefore numerical simulations remain required to measure the cusp displacement of the galaxy due\nto ram pressure drag.\nThere is also some scatter in the trend. We suspect this\nis largely due to the response of the disk to the ram pressure\nthat is not encapsulated in the Gunn and Gott Equation\n(Eq. 9). This includes not instantaneous stripping (resulting in a brief burst of enhanced ram pressure drag). We\nnote that this burst would not occur substantially for real\ngalaxies who feel a more gradual build-up of ram pressures.\nThis also includes barring of the gas disk - an effect that\nis most noteable in galaxy models experiencing the highest\ndrag forces.\nIn summary, we conclude that our simple anaytical\ntreatment is reasonably successful at predicting, to first order, the magnitude of the drag force, and it's dependencies\non disk properties and ram pressure. However the tests additionally highlight that the analytical predictions will fail\nif the gas disk of a model is not truncated in the idealised\nmanner described by the Gunn and Gott Equation (Eq. 9).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n3.5\n\n13\n\nStellar disk heating\n\nSo far, we have mainly considered the impact of ram pressure drag on the net displacement of the stellar disk and\nsurrounding dark matter. In this section we shall consider the influence of ram pressure on the internal dynamics of the stars within the disk. The previous study by\nSchulz & Struck (2001) states that the stellar disks of their\nmodels were largely unaffected internally, and were merely\ndisplaced.\nIn our simulations, we see indications of disturbances\nto the stellar disk. Stellar disks can pass through a brief\nperiod of morphological reshaping, appearing mildly conical\nin shape (for example, see Fig. 10). This reshaping occurs\nprimarily as the dark matter does not respond to a centrally\nlocated drag force as a solid body. Dark matter located directly by the truncated gas disk moves first, with a small lag\nbefore more distant dark matter responds. We note that the\ndistortion of the central dark matter must be fairly mild or\nthe stellar disk would not continue to appear disk like. However, the centre of the stellar disk may be displaced before\nthe outer stellar disk responds leaving a trailing outer disk,\nand resulting in the observed conical morphology.\nThe conical distortion is most significant when the central dark matter is accelerated most strongly. In the windtunnel tests this occurs most dramatically, as effectively an\ninitially isolated disk instantaneously meets the ICM wind.\nHowever, this situation is artificial as when a galaxy infalls\ninto a cluster, the ram pressure builds up more gradually.\nTo account for this, we repeat the cluster infall simulation\ndescribed in Section 3.1 but for the standard model, low\nconcentration, heavy disk, and small disk model, and for a\nvariety of orbits.\nWe do see a conical distortion in these simulations, as\nthe ram pressure is very peaked for this orbit causing a sudden acceleration of the central dark matter. However, the\noverall effect is far milder than presented in Fig. 10, due to\na more gradual build up of ram pressure. Although it should\nbe noted that the ICM may not be so smooth in real clusters\nas assumed in our cluster model. In particular, clusters that\nare still in the process of collapsing are very irregular (e.g.\nVirgo) and their ICM may be far from being isothermal, nor\nin hydrostatic equilibrium within the cluster potential well\n(Tecce et al. 2010).\nThe conical distortion is not long-lived in any of our\nsimulations, lasting <200 Myr at most (see, for example,\ntime-evolution in Fig. 10). Following the conical reshaping,\nstellar disks are seen to return to a flattened shape, but with\na thicker disk than prior to stripping. Disk thickening may\noccur as a result of the conical reshaping, and/or due to the\nremoval of a significant fraction of the total disk's mass, once\nthe gas component has been stripped. Here we analyse the\nrelative contribution of the conical distortion and the loss of\nthe gas potential to stellar disk thickening.\nTo quantify disk thickening, we measure the distance\nfrom the plane of the disk that contains half the total stellar mass.

Time-evolution of the effective disk thickness. Each panel is a different disk galaxy models (as indicated by the title of the\npanel). A dashed line represents the isolated/control model, and a dotted line represents the instantaneous gas removal model. Solid\nlines are wind-tunnel tests for a 2000 km s\u22121 fast wind (F), a 1500 km s\u22121 medium wind (M), and a 1000 km s\u22121 slow wind (S).\nWind-speed labels are indicated at the end of each solid-line. In most cases, disk thickening in wind-tunnel tests matches disk thickening\nin the instantaneous gas removal test, suggesting loss of the gas potential is the primary cause for disk thickening. Halo concentration is\nan additional parameter controlling the magnitude of disk thickening. The conical distortion can generally be seen as a temporary peak\nin effective disk thickness, typically lasting < 0.2 Gyr.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\ncentration, heavy disk, small disk and gas fraction models)\nare subjected to a high, medium, and low ram pressure in\nthese tests.\nThickening of the stellar disk occurs steadily with time,\neven in galaxy models that are evolved in isolation and are\nnot ram pressure stripped. As noted in Moore et al. (1999),\nthere are a number of artificial sources of disk heating due to\ndiscreteness including finite time-stepping, artificially large\ndark matter particles, and softened gravity. However, using\nan isolated galaxy model as a control, evolved over the same\ntime period, we can better understand the additional disk\nthickening that results from ram pressure stripping.\nIn order to quantify stellar disk heating that occurs\npurely from the reduction of the disk potential due to the\nremoval of the gas component, we additionally model the extreme case of instantaneous removal of the gas. At a chosen\ninstant, the gas component of our model vanishes instantaneously, and we meaure the resulting evolution of the effective disk thickness. These models are not subject to any stellar disk heating resulting from the conical distortion phase.\nBy comparison between evolution of the effective disk\nthickness in the control, the instantaneous gas removal, and\nthe wind tunnel tests, we can quantify and separate the individual role of the loss of the gas potential, and the conical\ndistortion to disk heating during ram pressure stripping. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 11.\nIn each panel, solid lines represent the evolution of the\neffective disk thickness for the wind-tunnel tests. There are\nthree solid lines for each model labelled to show the three\nwind speeds ('F' is fast, 'M' is medium, 'S' is slow) The\ndashed line is the isolated control galaxy model. The dotted\nline is instantaneous gas loss model. From left to right panel,\nstarting at the top row and moving down, we show results\nfor; the standard model, low concentration, heavy disk, small\ndisk, and reduced gas fraction models (g/s=0.3 and g/s=0.1)\nrespectively.\nIn each panel, the effective disk thickness can be seen to\njump upwards from the isolated control model (dashed line),\nwhile undergoing ram pressure stripping in the wind-tunnel\ntests (solid lines). The size of the increase varies considerably\nbetween the models (different panels).\nIn the wind tunnel tests (solid lines), disk heating could\npotentially result from both the conical distortion and the\nloss of the gas potential. However comparison with the instantaneous gas removal tests (dotted lines) reveals that the\nkey source of disk heating is actually from the removal of the\ngas. In most cases, the final stellar disks have an effective\nthickness roughly equal to that of the instantaneous removal\nmodels. This suggests that the removal of the gas potential\nis the primary cause of disk thickening.\nThe conical distortion can be seen to result in an apparent short duration spike of raised effective disk thickness.\nHowever this is primarily a result of the way that disk thickeness is measured, assuming a flattened disk (not accounting\nfor a conical distortion), and does not reflect a real spike in\ndisk thickness. However this does confirm the short duration\nof the conical distortion phase (<200 Myr for all models).\nIn the low concentration, small disk and heavy disk\nmodel, the disk thickening is milder with slow winds. In\nthese cases, the effective disk thickness has a value midway between the value for instantaneous gas removal and\nthe value of the control model. With slow winds, these disk\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n15\n\nmodels maintain a sizeable quantity of gas at inner radii,\nthat continues to provide a source of disk potential. In the\nouter disk, where the gas has been stripped, the stellar disk\nexpands but in the inner disk it cannot expand.\nWe conclude that the key source of stellar disk thickening, due to ram pressure stripping, is due to the loss of the\ngas potential and that the conical distortion has little impact. It is therefore intuitive that the degree of disk heating\nmust depend sensitively on the gas fraction of the original\ndisk.\nThis can indeed be seen when comparing the lower gas\nfraction models (lower two panels) and the standard model\n(upper left panel): The standard model has a gas to stellar\nmass ratio of 1 causing the effective disk thickness to increase\nby \u223c55% due to ram pressure stripping. For a gas to stellar\nmass ratio of 0.3, the disk thickness increases by \u223c 30%. For\na gas to stellar mass ratio of 0.1, the disk thickness increases\nby only \u223c 12%.\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of disk surface density on disk heating from gas removal. In principal a comparison of the standard model with the small and heavy disk\nmodel should enable this. The small disk model has a surface\ndensity \u223c70% larger than the standard model, and yet it too\nexpands by about the same factor (\u223c55%), suggesting disk\nsurface density is not a strong factor. The heavy disk model\ninitially expands to the value seen in the instantaneous gas\nloss simulation, but continues to thicken. At this point it has\nthickened by \u223c 55% - equal to the standard model. However\nthe gas disk in this model becomes heavily barred and the\nrotation of this non-axisymmetric gas distribution results in\na secondary source of stellar heating until the bar has been\nstripped (the final disk is 90% thicker than the control).\nDisk surface density does not appear to play a key role\nin determining disk heating unless it causes disk barring.\nIn this current study, we can not draw strong conclusion as noted previously, we cannot be confident that our simple\nisothermal treatment of the galaxy gas can realistically treat\nthe complex gas physics involved in bar formation.\nFinally, we do see a dependency of disk heating on the\nhalo concentration. Both the standard model (upper left\npanel) and the low concentration model (upper right panel)\nhave an equal gas-to-stellar mass ratio, yet the disk thickness increases by \u223c 80% in the low concentration model in\ncomparison to the \u223c 55% in the standard model. This indicates that, while the stellar disks of both models may have\ngained equal kinetic energy due to the removal of the gas potential, the low concentration model's shallower dark matter\nwell allows the stellar disk to expand to a greater degree.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe current state-of-art in ram pressure stripping modelling\ntypically place strong emphasis on providing the highest possible resolution to the gas disk component of a late-type\nspiral galaxy. This is indeed necessary to resolve the detailed hydrodynamical mechanisms occurring at the interstellar medium/intercluster medium interface. As a result,\nsuch studies (see for example Roediger & Br\u00fcggen 2007) use\nanalytical potentials to model the gravitational influence of\nthe stellar disk and dark matter halo on the gas dynamics.\nIn comparison our toy model of ram pressure stripping\n\n\f16\n\nR.Smith et al\n\nis hugely idealised and does not contain a live ICM gas component. However, its simplicity has enabled us to treat the\ndark matter halo and stellar disk with a live component that\ncan dynamically evolve during the ram pressure stripping\nprocess. This is clearly crucial to studying the dynamical\neffects of ram pressure on the stellar disk and dark matter\nhalo component of a galaxy.\nThe Gunn and Gott condition (see Eqn. 9) has frequently been shown to provide a reasonable first-order predictions of the extent to which a gas disk is truncated by ram\npressure. We demonstrate that if the Gunn and Gott condition is satisfied, the force upon the gas disk, and thereby the\nforce transmitted to the stellar disk and surrounding central\ndark matter, can be analytically calculated. Furthermore, it\ncan be calculated for varying ram pressures, and for disks\nwith a variety of properties.\nHowever, we note one nuance. We have so far assumed\nthat the force on the truncated gas disk is simply the area\nof the disk (measured to the truncation radius), with the\nproduct of the ram pressure (calculated using the product\nof density of the ICM with the wind velocity squared). This\nis valid if a galaxy is moving sub-sonically through the ICM.\nHowever Roediger & Hensler (2005) note that this may not\nbe the case once the galaxy moves supersonically through\nthe ICM, thereby generating a shock-wave infront of the\ndisk. While momentum density is conserved perpendicular\nto a shock front, the velocity v downstream of the shock is\nreduced while the density is increased. They state that in\nthis situation the ram pressure on the disk behind the shock\nfront is reduced by the same factor as v. In their simulations,\nv is reduced by a factor 0.6 and 0.36 for Mach numbers of\n1.42 and 2.53 respectively.\nOur toy model does not account for the reduction in ram\npressure due to shock fronts from supersonic motion. For\nthe cluster model used in Section 2.4, we note that, for the\nassumed isothermal gas temperature, the ICM sound speed\nis \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 . Therefore galaxies with velocities as high\nas \u223c2500 km s\u22121 may feel a ram pressure drag force \u223c 65%\nless strong. However this is less of an issue in the wind-tunnel\ntests, as we have chosen a fixed cluster ICM density and\nvaried only the galaxy velocity in order to produce a range of\nram pressures. For a more dense, but still entirely reasonable\nchoice of ICM wind density, an equal magnitude range of\nram pressures can be produced for sub-sonic velocities.\nSo far we have restricted our study of ram pressure drag\neffects to a single halo mass of galaxy (1010 M\u2299 ), perhaps\nconsistent with a medium-mass dwarf galaxy. It is interesting to note that the ram pressure drag force on a giant spiral\nmay be vastly larger. For example, consider a giant bulgeless disk galaxy with a stellar mass of 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , a gas\nfraction of 20%, and a disk scale-length of 2 kpc. Assuming it is moving through an ICM of density equal to that of\nthe wind-tunnel tests with a velocity of 1000 km s\u22121 , the\ndrag force upon its stellar and dark matter is a factor \u223c75\ntimes larger than for our standard model under the same\nram pressure. Drag forces are expected to be even stronger\nif the galaxy contains a significant bulge that increases the\nrestoring force on the gas disk even further. However, the\nstellar disk mass, and dark matter component that the gas\ndisk must drag is also significantly larger.\nAnother interesting consideration is the effects of ram\npressure drag acting on tidal dwarf galaxies. Such galaxies\n\nare believed to contain very little dark matter and be gas\nrich (Duc et al. 1998). If the disks of tidal dwarf galaxies are\nsufficiently high in surface density to maintain a truncated\ngas disk against ram pressure, their stellar disks might be\nheavily effected by ram pressure drag; with little or no dark\nmatter, the stellar disk, alone, would provide the analogous\npayload on the gas disk. Furthermore, their stellar component should respond far more significantly to the removal of\nthe gas potential than in dark matter dominated models.\nDisk thickening is currently the best observational\nprobe of the ram pressure drag effect. However, as disks are\nonly expected to expand by at maximum a factor of two,\nit may be a challenging effect to observe in dark matter\ndominated dwarfs. We note that, so far, we have only considered gas fractions as high as 50% (e.g. the standard and\nlow concentration model). Disk thickening may be stronger\nin more gas-rich dwarf galaxies, and higher gas fractions\nbecome increasingly common at lower galaxy luminosities\n(Gavazzi et al. 2008).\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS\n\nRam pressure stripping applies a drag force to a truncated\ngas disk of a spiral galaxy. Gas within the truncated disk\ncannot be stripped because the self-gravity of the galaxy\ncan overwhelm the ram pressure force. However, this does\nnot mean that the ram pressure drag force simply vanishes.\nWe demonstrate that from Newton's third law, it is inevitable that the drag force on the gas disk is transmitted to\nthe stellar disk and dark matter halo through their mutual\ngravitational attraction. Using this approach, we develop a\nsimple analytical equation, based on the Gunn and Gott\nstripping criteria, that predicts the magnitude of the drag\nforce on disk galaxies of varying properties.\nHowever the analytical formula cannot predict the response of the stellar disk and dark matter to this forcing.\nUsing a simple toy model of ram pressure, we study the dynamical response of the dark matter and stellar disk to this\ndrag force. We find that the stellar disk, and surrounding\ncentral dark matter, can be displaced by ram pressure drag.\nThe displacement is not negligible, and can be of order several kiloparsecs.\nWe find that our analytical formulation of the drag force\ncan be used to predict the actual drag force to first order\nfor a variety of ram pressures and disk galaxy models. However, it is intrinsically based on the Gunn & Gott stripping\ncriteria, and therefore may fail if the criteria fails.\nBeyond a pure displacement of the stellar and surrounding central dark matter, we find that ram pressure stripping\ncan influence the internal dynamics of the stellar disk. During gas stripping, the stellar disks of our models can develop\na slight conical appearance as they are towed along by an\ninner truncated gas disk.\nThis conical phase is brief (<200 Myr) and once it is\ncomplete, the final stellar disk appears largely unaffected.\nThis indicates that the potential well of the dark matter\nsurrounding the disk is only mildly and temporarily effected\nby ram pressure drag.\nHowever the final stellar disks of our models indicate\nthat disk thickening has occurred. We find this is predominantly due to reduction in the total disk potential as a result\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201317\n\n\fRam Pressure drag\nof the loss of the gas component. The expansion of the stellar disk is therefore strongly dependent on the gas fraction\nof the original disk. It is also more weakly dependent on\nthe concentration of the halo. For an initially gas rich disk,\nin a low concentration halo, the stellar disk thickness can\nincrease by close to a factor of two.\nOur key results may be summarised as follows.\n(i) The drag force exerted by ram pressure on a truncated gas disk can be transmitted to the stellar disk and\nsurrounding central dark matter of a disk galaxy.\n(ii) This can displace the stellar disk and central dark\nmatter by several kiloparsecs in the direction of the ram\npressure wind.\n(iii) The motion of the central dark matter can result in\na brief and mild conical-like distortion of the stellar disk,\nlasting no more than 200 Myr.\n(iv) Disk thickening as a result of ram pressure occurs\npredominantly due to the reduction in the total disk's potential as a result of gas loss. Disks can thicken by as much\nas a factor of two as a result of ram pressure in disks with a\ngas fraction of 50%.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nRS is funded through ESO's Comite Mixto.
