INTRODUCTION\n\nCurrently, several fundamental questions about the\nlow-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) require better\nobservational constraints. What fraction of the ordinary\nbaryonic matter in the universe is located in the IGM\nat the present epoch? What are the physical conditions\nof the intergalactic baryons? To what degree have intergalactic gas clouds been enriched with metals, and\nwhat are the physical processes that exchange matter\nand energy between galaxies and the IGM? Interest in\nthe properties of the low-redshift IGM is motivated by\nseveral broad issues in galaxy evolution and cosmology:\n1 Based on observations with (1) the NASA/ESA Hubble Space\nTelescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,\nwhich is operated by the Association of Universities for Research\nin Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555, and (2)\nthe NASA-CNES/ESA Far Ultraoviolet Spectroscopic Explorer\nmission, operated by Johns Hopkins University, supported by\nNASA contract NAS 5-32985.\n2 Department of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts,\n710 North Pleasant Street, Amherst, MA 01003-9305;\ntripp@fcrao1.astro.umass.edu\n3 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive,\nBaltimore, MD 21218\n4 Princeton University Observatory, Peyton Hall, Ivy Lane,\nPrinceton, NJ 08544\n5 Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin-Madison,\n475 North Charter Street, Madison, WI 53706\n6 Department of Physics, University of Notre Dame, 225 Nieuwland Science Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556\n7 Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam, Am Neuen Palais\n10, 14469 Potsdam, Germany\n\nFirst, theoretical studies indicate that the IGM is the\nprimary reservoir of baryons throughout the history of\nthe universe, but the IGM is predicted to change from\npredominantly cool, photoionized gas at high redshifts\nto a mixture of shock-heated gas, photoionized gas, and\ncondensed objects (stars) at low redshifts (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999,2001; Cen & Ostriker 2006).\nThe conversion of a substantial fraction of the IGM from\ncool gas into moderately hot gas could solve the longstanding \"missing baryons problem\", the fact that the\ninventory of readily-observed low-z baryonic matter (e.g.,\nPersic & Salucci 1992; Fukugita et al. 1998) falls far\nshort of the quantity expected based on big bang nucleosynthesis and deuterium measurements (e.g., O'Meara\net al. 2006) and cosmic microwave background observations (e.g., Spergel et al. 2006). As time passes, gas collects in deeper potential wells. Some of that gas cools and\nforms stars, but hydrodynamic simulations show that\nas gas accretes into the potential wells of galaxies and\ngroups/clusters, gravitational shock heating drives much\nof it into the 105 \u2212 107 K temperature range (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). The models indicate that\nthis shocked material is often located in modest overdensity regions outside of galaxies, and it is cooler and less\ndense than the X-ray emitting hot gas seen in galaxy\nclusters, hence it has been dubbed the \"warm-hot intergalactic medium\" (WHIM). Dav\u00e9 et al. (2001) have\nanalyzed a set of six hydrodynamic cosmological simulations with diverse computational characteristics (e.g.,\n\n\f2\n\nTripp et al.\n\ndifferent spatial resolutions and box sizes, different numerical methods, and different assumptions about and\ntreatments of physical processes), and they find that the\nsimulations all robustly predict that a substantial fraction of the baryons (30 \u2212 50% ) should be found in the\nWHIM at z \u2248 0 (see also Cen & Fang 2006). Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations are now being used for a\nwide variety of purposes, so it is important to test the\nrobust predictions from these simulations with observations. WHIM observations are also valuable for this purpose as well as for probing fundamental questions about\nthe physical conditions and distribution of the baryons.\nIn addition, more recent simulations suggest that WHIM\nmodels (and the very definition of the \"WHIM\") may require refinements. For example, while the original simulations placed the low\u2212z missing baryons in the 105 \u2212107\nK range, the simulations of Kang et al. (2005) indicate\nthat a significant portion of the WHIM is heated and\nionized by lower-velocity shocks and photoionization and\nhas T < 105 K. Obtaining good constraints on the properties of the WHIM is now a major observational goal of\nIGM studies.\nSecond, it is becoming increasingly evident that the\nprocesses that add or remove gas and energy from galaxies play an important role in galaxy evolution (e.g., Keres\net al. 2005; Veilleux et al. 2005; Voit 2005). However, most observational constraints on processes such as\ngas accretion and feedback via galactic winds are limited to regions relatively close to galaxies. Low-redshift\nabsorption systems in the spectra of quasi-stellar objects\n(QSOs) can provide detailed information about the physical conditions and chemical enrichment of intergalactic\ngas farther away from galaxies and thereby provide a\nmore complete view of how matter and energy are exchanged between galaxies and the IGM. For example, observations of nearby star-forming galaxies show a strong\nrelationship between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004) that has been suggested\nto be a result of galactic winds: in the deeper potential\nwells of more massive galaxies, supernova ejecta are retained, but lower-mass objects lose metals into the IGM\nby the action of Galactic winds (e.g., Mac Low & Ferrara\n1999). But how much impact does this \"feedback\" from\na lower-mass galaxy have on its environment? Escaping\noutflows can, in principle, travel substantial distances\nfrom the source galaxies. Direct evidence of winds has\nbeen found in the immediate vicinity of starbursting and\nultraluminous infrared galaxies (Veilleux et al. 2005, and\nreferences therein), but how large is the \"sphere of influence\" of such galaxies? Many commonly employed techniques for the study of galactic outflows, e.g., optical and\nX-ray emission observations, lose track of escaping material as it flows away from the source, and absorption spectroscopy of star clusters within the galaxies, while highly\nuseful, mainly probes the outflows within a few kpc of\nthe galaxies. QSO absorption lines provide a unique opportunity to probe the lower density material at larger\ndistances away from interesting foreground galaxies.\nMoreover, many recent papers have considered the possibility that galaxy evolution is affected by feedback from\nblack hole accretion-driven processes in QSOs and active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) such as QSO/AGN winds that\nmight develop when significant amounts of matter are\ndriven into the central regions of galaxies (e.g., Springel\n\net al. 2005a,b). The dramatic \"broad absorption line\"\n(BAL) QSOs (e.g., Turnshek 1988) provide evidence that\nsuch outflows exist, and with outflow velocities that often\nexceed 10,000 km s\u22121 , BAL QSOs could propel material\nto substantial distances and affect a large region surrounding a QSO. While it is not clear from observations\nhow much impact BAL QSOs really have on their surroundings, we do know that BALs are relatively common:\nbased on a large sample of QSOs from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS), Trump et al. (2006) report that 26%\nof a sample of QSOs at z \u2265 1.7 show broad C IV absorption features. Moreover, there is evidence that some narrow absorption lines arise in QSO outflows (see \u00a72.4.2),\nand lower-luminosity AGNs are also known to drive highvelocity flows (Crenshaw et al. 2003). These observations raise several questions: How many of the absorbers\nwith zabs \u226a zQSO arise in high-velocity QSO/AGN outflows? How do these outflows affect their surroundings?\nAre they important sources of feedback, and on what\nscales? When using QSOs to study the foreground \"ordinary\" IGM, we can also simultaneously search for any\nevidence of narrow absorption lines that arise in QSO\noutflows.\nFor the last several years, we have used high-resolution\nultraviolet QSO spectra to study the properties of the\nintergalactic medium in the nearby universe, galaxyabsorber connections, and the roles played by the IGM\nin galaxy evolution. We have provided complete surveys of all absorption lines detected on individual QSO\nsight lines (Sembach et al. 2001; Savage et al. 2002;\nJenkins et al. 2003; Richter et al. 2004; Sembach et al.\n2004; Lehner et al. 2006, 2007) as well as detailed studies of individual systems of interest (e.g., Tripp et al.\n2000,2001,2002,2005,2006a; Tripp & Savage 2000; Savage et al. 2005; Jenkins et al. 2005; Aracil et al. 2006).\nThe low\u2212z IGM has been extensively studied with highresolution spectra by other groups as well (e.g., Penton et\nal. 2000a,b; 2002; 2004; Chen & Prochaska 2000; Chen et\nal. 2005; Prochaska et al. 2004, 2006; Shull et al. 1998,\n2003; Stocke et al. 2004,2006; Danforth & Shull 2005;\nDanforth et al. 2006; Tumlinson et al. 2005; Cooksey\net al. 2007; Thom & Chen 2008). These studies have\nprovided clear observational evidence that a substantial\nfraction of the baryons are in the IGM at the present\nepoch, but many key questions remain open.\nIn this paper, we employ a larger sample in order to\ninvestigate the statistical properties and physical conditions of the low\u2212z IGM. For this purpose, we present a\nsurvey of low\u2212z O VI absorbers based on high-resolution\nultraviolet spectra of sixteen low-redshift QSOs observed\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Our observations were made with the E140M echelle mode of STIS,\nwhich provides excellent spectral resolution (7 km s\u22121\nFWHM). Moreover, these spectra have good sensitivity\nfor detection of weak absorption lines; the data are sufficient for detection of lines with rest-frame equivalent\nwidths Wr > 30 m\u00c5 over a substantial path length. Consequently, these sight lines provide a unique opportunity\nto obtain precise and deep measurements of low\u2212z QSO\nabsorbers. For seven of our sight lines, we supplement\nthe STIS observations with spectra obtained with the\nFar Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), which extend the spectral coverage farther into the far ultraviolet.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\nIn this paper, we present the first results from this survey: we report the measurements of all intervening and\nproximate O VI absorption-line systems in these spectra with a focus on the statistics and physical conditions\nof the absorbers. While our primary interest is in the\nIGM, to assess the issues discussed above, we also compare and contrast the intervening and proximate (i.e.,\nzabs \u2248 zQSO ) absorbers.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In \u00a72, we present\nthe ultraviolet spectra that we use for the survey, and\nwe discuss the data reduction (\u00a72.1), our procedures for\nline identifications and measurements (\u00a72.2 and 2.3, respectively), and our classification of the absorbers (\u00a72.4);\nwe describe in \u00a72.4.1 how we distinguish between apparently simple/single-phase absorbers and complex multiphase systems, and in \u00a72.4.2 we also separate the systems\ninto intervening absorbers or \"proximate\" (zabs \u2248 zQSO )\ncases. A variety of statistics of the intervening and proximate absorbers are reviewed in \u00a73 including the number\nof O VI absorbers detected per unit redshift (\u00a73.1), the\ncolumn density and Doppler parameter distributions of\nthe O VI lines (\u00a73.2), the correlation (or lack thereof)\nbetween the O VI column densities and Doppler parameters (\u00a73.3), a detailed comparison of the shapes of the\nO VI and H I lines and the fractions of the absorbers\nthat have well-aligned O VI and H I profiles (\u00a73.4),\nand the correlations of N (O VI) and N (H I)/N (O VI)\nwith N (H I) (\u00a73.5). We analyze the physical conditions of the intervening absorbers in \u00a74. In this section, we first derive constraints on the absorber plasma\ntemperatures for components with well-aligned O VI and\nH I profiles under the assumption that the good correspondence of the O VI and H I profile centroids indicates that the O VI and H I lines arise in the same gas\n(\u00a74.1.1). We then show that while purely collisionally\nionized models work poorly given the implied cool temperatures (\u00a74.1.2), models including photoionization are\nhighly consistent with the properties of the well-matched\nO VI and H I lines (\u00a74.1.3,\u00a74.1.4). In \u00a74.2 we demonstrate\nthat the complex multicomponent/multiphase O VI absorbers can accommodate warm-hot gas, but additional\ninformation is needed to constrain these complex systems. We also examine in \u00a74.2.1 whether the apparently\nsimple and cold O VI absorbers could actually be multiphase systems, including hot collisionally ionized gas, in\nwhich the broad H I absorption expected to go with the\nhot O VI phase is hidden in the noise. We find that this is\npossible if the O VI absorbers are essentially always multiphase systems with the O VI frequently located in a quiescent interface layer on the surface of a cooler phase. We\nclose with discussion of the implications of our measurements, including comments on the baryonic content of\nthe intervening absorbers and some suggestions for future\nobservations (\u00a75) before we summarize the paper in \u00a76.\nThe Appendix provides comments about individual absorption systems including line identification and problems caused by blending, hot pixels, and saturation. In\nthis work, we assume the solar oxygen and carbon abundances reported by Allende Prieto et al. (2001,2002):\n(O/H)\u2299 = 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 , (C/H)\u2299 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . We note\nthat these abundances are currently a topic of debate\n(e.g., Basu & Antia 2004; Bahcall et al. 2005a,b), and\nthe solar C and O abundances could be \u2248 0.2 dex higher.\nWhile important for some questions about low\u2212z O VI\n\n3\n\nabsorbers, this level of uncertainty does not significantly\nimpact the results presented in this paper. In this paper\nwe also assume H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n2. DATA\n2.1. Ultraviolet Spectroscopy\n\nOur survey of low-redshift O VI absorbers is based\nprimarily on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy of\nQSOs acquired with STIS. We only use data obtained\nwith the E140M echelle mode of STIS for two reasons:\n(1) this setup provides the best combination of spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio that can\nbe obtained in practical amounts of HST time, and (2)\nsingle exposures with this STIS mode cover a relatively\nlarge wavelength range. STIS E140M observations typically cover the 1150\u22121730 \u00c5 range with 7 km s\u22121 resolution (FWHM) with 2 pixels per resolution element.8\nThe E140M wavelength scale calibration is excellent: the\nSTIS Handbook (Kim Quijano et al. 2003) reports that\nthe relative wavelength scale is accurate to 0.25\u22120.5 pixels (\u223c 1\u22122 km s\u22121 ) across the full spectral range, and the\nabsolute wavelength calibration is accurate to 0.5 \u2212 1.0\npixels (\u223c 2 \u2212 4 km s\u22121 ). We have occasionally identified\nslightly larger relative wavelength scale errors (Tripp et\nal. 2005), but we generally find agreement with the STIS\nHandbook wavelength accuracies. We reduced the STIS\ndata using the STIS ID Team version of CALSTIS at the\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Our procedure for reduction of the STIS E140M data is described in Tripp et\nal. (2001,2005) and includes the two-dimensional echelle\nscattered light correction (Valenti et al. 2002) and the algorithm for automatic repair of hot pixels (Lindler 2003).\nWarm/hot pixels are a difficult problem suffered by the\nSTIS MAMA detector used in the E140M mode, and the\npossible effects of warm/hot pixels must always be borne\nin mind. The hot pixel problem often affects several adjacent pixels (see examples in \u00a72.4.1 and the Appendix),\nand thus hot pixel \"features\" can have a more severe impact than a single occasional bad pixel. In some cases,\nthe automatic hot pixel repair algorithm successfully corrects hot pixels by interpolation, but many warm/hot\npixels are not identified by the algorithm and are evident in the final spectra. Up until 2002 August, the\nposition of the spectrum on the E140M MAMA detector\nwas moved roughly monthly.9 This offsetting procedure\nprovides another means to identify and suppress hot pixels: when the STIS observations were obtained on multiple dates separated by more than a month (see Table 1),\nhot pixels will only be present in the extracted spectrum\nin observations obtained on a particular date (because\nthe spectrum was shifted to a different place on the detector on the other dates). By masking and rejecting\nthe pixels in the affected individual exposures obtained\nat the \"bad\" position, the hot pixels can be suppressed.\nOf course, this reduces the S/N ratio in the affected region because only a subset of the exposures are coadded\nin that region, but by judiciously masking a minimum\n8 The E140M spectral resolution is a factor of 3 (or more) higher\nthan any of the STIS first-order grating modes, and the wavelength\nrange is \u223c6 times larger.\n9 After 2002 August, this procedure was halted to enable a sensitivity correction that better accounts for the echelle blaze.\n\n\f4\n\nTripp et al.\n\nnumber of pixels in the vicinity of the hot pixel feature,\nthe impact of S/N loss is minimized. Hot pixels are often\nquite obvious, even in individual exposures. However,\nlow-level \"warm\" pixels can be difficult to recognize, and\nmany of the QSOs were observed on essentially a single\ndate (i.e., with the spectrum located at the same place\non the detector for all exposures) or were observed after\n2002 August, so unfortunately, in some cases we were\nunable to mitigate the effect of warm/hot pixel features.\nAn example of hot pixel supression and comments on\nhot pixel problems are provided in the Appendix. Further information on the design and performance of STIS\ncan be found in Kimble et al. (1998) and Woodgate et\nal. (1998).\nFor this survey, we used two simple criteria to select\nlow-redshift QSOs from the STIS E140M archive: (1)\nwe required the QSO redshift (zQSO ) to be greater than\n0.15 in order to provide a sufficiently large redshift range\nthat could be searched for the O VI \u03bb\u03bb 1031.93, 1037.62\ndoublet, and (2) the S/N had to be sufficient to detect\nlines with rest-frame equivalent width Wr > 30 m\u00c5 over\na substantial portion of the O VI redshift range. These\ncriteria resulted in a sample of 16 low-redshift QSOs.\nWe summarize in Table 1 some basic properties of the\n16 sight lines including zQSO , Galactic coordinates, and\ncolumn densities of the Galactic H I and H2 due to the\nforeground ISM in each direction.10 Table 1 also provides a log of the STIS E140M observations. Ten of the\ntargets are from our own HST programs that were explicitly designed to study low\u2212z O VI absorbers; the\nother 6 targets were not observed specifically to investigate the O VI systems but were generally selected to\nstudy various types of low\u2212z QSO absorbers. Because\nthe observations were obtained for different programs,\nsome used the 0.\u2032\u2032 06 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 2 aperture while others used the\n0.\u2032\u2032 2 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 2 slit as noted in Table 1. The spectroscopic linespread function has more prominent broad wings when\nthe 0.\u2032\u2032 2 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 2 is used (Kim Quijano et al. 2003), and we\ntake this into account when fitting Voigt profiles to the\nabsorption lines (see below). Most of the targets in our\nsample were observed to similar S/N ratios, but there\nis some S/N variation among the sight lines, and a few\nof the QSO spectra have better S/N (e.g., 3C 273.0 and\nH1821+643). For purposes of comparison, the final column in Table 1 lists the mean S/N ratio per resolution\nelement in a 2 \u00c5 continuum region11 at \u03bbob \u2248 1300 \u00c5.\nMany of the QSOs in our sample have also been observed with FUSE for various purposes (e.g., Savage et\nal. 2003; Sembach et al. 2003). The STIS E140M\nwavelength range covers O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93,1037.62 doublets with redshifts ranging from zabs & 0.12 out to the\nredshift of the QSO for all 16 QSOs.12 The FUSE spec10 Galactic ISM lines block portions of the spectrum and reduce\nthe effective path that can be searched for extragalactic lines of\ninterest; the H I and H2 column densities in Table 1 provide an\nindication of the degree of blocking and confusion caused by the\nISM.\n11 We used a 2 \u00c5 region centered on 1300 \u00c5 unless a line was\nfound in that region, in which case a small shift was applied so\nthat the S/N was calculated in a line-free continuum region.\n12 The STIS E140M sensitivity drops precipitously at \u03bb . 1175\n\u00c5; the S/N of the data and the lower redshift limit for which the\nSTIS data provide useful coverage of O VI vary from sightline to\nsightline depending on the flux of the QSO at \u03bb < 1200 \u00c5 and the\ntotal integration time.\n\ntrographs cover the 912 \u2212 1187 \u00c5 range, and therefore\nFUSE data can be used to extend the survey to cover\nall O VI absorbers with 0 \u2264 zabs \u2264 zQSO . However,\nthe FUSE bandpass has a high density of lines arising\nfrom the Milky Way ISM, particularly molecular hydrogen lines from various rotational levels (see, e.g., Wakker\n2006; Gillmon et al. 2006), as well as extragalactic Lyman series H I lines and a rich array of (sometimes unfamiliar) metal lines (Verner, Barthel, & Tytler 1994) that\nare redshifted into the FUSE bandpass for extragalactic absorbers. Consequently, one of the lines of the O VI\ndoublet is often blocked by some unrelated line and is unmeasureable. For this reason, extra caution is warranted\nwith the FUSE spectra because ISM and extragalactic\nlines can be incorrectly identified as redshifted O VI. We\nhave supplemented our STIS survey with FUSE observations, but only for the seven sight lines in the sample for\nwhich complete identifications of all lines in the FUSE\nbandpass have been published, including 3C 273.0 (Sembach et al. 2001), H1821+643 (Sembach et al. 2008),\nHE0226-4110 (Lehner et al. 2006), PG0953+415 (Savage et al. 2002), PG1116+215 (Sembach et al. 2004),\nPG1259+593 (Richter et al. 2004), and PHL1811 (Jenkins et al. 2003,2005). In addition, we have used FUSE\nspectra to measure higher Lyman series H I lines and\nC III \u03bb977.020 lines, when they can be securely identified, for other sightlines.\nWe acquired the FUSE spectra from the archive and\nreduced them following the method described in Tripp\net al. (2005). The FUSE spectral resolution is lower\nthan the STIS E140M resolution: the FUSE resolution\nis \u223c 20 \u2212 25 km s\u22121 (FWHM). The uncertainty in the\nFUSE wavelength-scale zero point is also larger. Moos\net al. (2002) report that the \u03bb zero point uncertainty is\ntypically \u00b130 km s\u22121 but can be as large as \u00b1100 km\ns\u22121 .13 However, we have bootstrap calibrated the FUSE\ndata by aligning well-detected lines in the FUSE spectra\nwith appropriate, comparable-strength lines in the corresponding STIS spectrum.14 The bootstrap calibration\nreduces the uncertainty in the FUSE wavelength-scale\nzero point to 5 \u2212 10 km s\u22121 . Additional information\nabout the design and on-orbit performance of FUSE can\nbe found in Moos et al. (2000,2002) and Sahnow et al.\n(2000).\n2.2. Absorption-Line Identification\nSeveral groups have studied the properties of low\u2212z\nQSO absorption lines (see \u00a71), and the various groups\nhave employed different methods and criteria for identifying lines and selecting samples. The differing methods\naffect the statistics and analysis outcomes and must be\nborne in mind when comparing results from different papers. We molded our line identification procedure based\n13 Improvements of the CALFUSE data reduction software implemented after the analysis of Moos et al. (2002) have improved\nthe FUSE wavelength-scale uncertainty; see Dixon et al. (2007)\nand Bowen et al. (2007) for details.\n14 For example, we always aligned the Milky Way Fe II \u03bb1144.94\nline (FUSE) with the Galactic Fe II \u03bb1608.45 line (STIS), and we\naligned Galactic C II \u03bb1036.34 (FUSE) with C II \u03bb1334.53 (STIS).\nThese strong ISM lines are always detected, and because they have\nsimilar f \u03bb values, the FUSE and STIS profiles have similar shapes\nand structure that can be used to accurately align the FUSE data\nwith the STIS data. The STIS data are binned to the resolution\nof the FUSE spectra before the lines are compared and aligned.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\non several issues that affect the identification of extragalactic O VI lines: (1) The first high-resolution studies\nof low\u2212z O VI absorbers showed that they have a wide\nrange of properties. For example, Tripp et al. (2000)\nfound that the N (O VI)/N (H I) ratio varies by a factor\nof \u226537 in the O VI systems observed toward H1821+643,\nand subsequent studies have confirmed that the O VI/H I\ncolumn density ratio is highly variable in these systems\n(e.g., Danforth & Shull 2005). Because the H I Ly\u03b1\nline can be quite weak in O VI systems, we cannot compile an unbiased sample by first selecting H I Ly\u03b1 lines\nand then searching for the corresponding O VI doublet;\nthis approach would miss O VI systems that have little\nor no detectable H I absorption (such systems do exist,\nas we show below). (2) Extragalactic O VI and affiliated lines can be partially or fully blocked (hidden) due\nto blending with unrelated absorption lines, either from\nthe foreground ISM or from absorption systems at other\nredshifts. (3) Emission features can partially or fully\ncontaminate absorption lines. In the STIS spectra, the\n\"emission\" features that cause contamination are mainly\nwarm/hot pixels, which can extend across several adjacent pixels and thereby fill in real absorption lines (see\n\u00a72.4.1 and Appendix). Some of the hot pixels can be assuaged by the procedures discussed above, but many of\nthe warm/hot pixels are not adequately removed in the\nfully reduced data. In the FUSE data, airglow emission\nlines from the Earth's atmosphere are present at various wavelengths (Feldman et al. 2001). Some of the the\nairglow lines are excited by sunlight and can be significantly suppressed by using FUSE data recorded on the\nnight side of the orbit only, but this reduces the total integration time and S/N of the final spectrum, and some\nresidual airglow emission features remain in the nightonly spectra. In this paper, we use all of the available\nFUSE data (day and night) in order to maximize the\ndata S/N.\nTo identify extragalactic O VI absorbers (and the ancillary lines in their absorption systems) in a way that\nconsiders these issues, we employed a two-pass search\nprocedure:\nIn the first pass, we searched each spectrum for lines\nthat have the relative wavelength separation and the relative line strengths of the redshifted O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93,\n1037.62 doublet. In order to be included in our samples\nthat are used for statistical measurements and physical\nconditions analyses in the rest of the paper, we required\nthat lines have measured rest-frame equivalent widths\n(Wr ) that are recorded at 3\u03c3 significance or better. However, for identification of doublets or H I Lyman series\nlines, it is useful to examine marginally detected lines as\nwell. For example, in several cases we detected the O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 line at the 4 \u2212 5\u03c3 level, and the weaker corresponding O VI \u03bb1037.62 line was found at \u2248 2\u03c3 significance. In these cases, the marginally detected \u03bb1037.62\nline bolsters the O VI identification, so we report the\nmarginal \u03bb1037.62 Wr measurement but mainly rely on\nthe well-detected line for subsequent analyses. Marginal\n(and undetected) lines such as higher H I Lyman series\nlines are also useful for establishing that the well-detected\nline measurements are not badly affected by unresolved\nsaturation. For example, if a moderately strong H I Ly\u03b1\nline is detected but the corresponding Ly\u03b2 line is not\npresent, this provides some assurance that the measure-\n\n5\n\nments based on Ly\u03b1 are not badly corrupted by saturation. When we identified an O VI doublet in this first\npass, we then searched for and identified all affiliated H I\nLyman series and metal lines (e.g., C III \u03bb977.020, C IV\n\u03bb\u03bb1548.20, 1550.78, and Si III \u03bb1206.50) at the same\nredshift. For a large fraction of our O VI absorbers,\nwe only detect O VI and H I lines, but we do detect\nC III and Si III in a useful number of absorbers, and\nwe occasionally find additional metal lines such as the\nC IV doublet, C II \u03bb1334.53, or the N V doublet. In\na few cases, a rich array of low-ionization lines are detected as well as O VI (e.g., Chen & Prochaska 2000;\nSembach et al. 2004; Savage et al. 2005; Ganguly et\nal. 2006). In this paper, we will concentrate on the implications of the H I, O VI, and C III measurements and\nlimits. Analyses of other detected extragalactic metals in\nthe 16 sight lines in this paper will be presented in subsequent papers or have already been published (Tripp\net al. 2000,2001,2002,2005,2006a; Tripp & Savage 2000;\nOegerle et al. 2000; Chen & Prochaska 2000; Sembach et\nal. 2001,2004; Savage et al. 2002,2005; Yuan et al. 2002;\nJenkins et al. 2003,2005; Prochaska et al. 2004,2006;\nRichter et al. 2004; Stocke et al. 2004; Bregman et al.\n2004; Narayanan et al. 2005; Aracil et al. 2006; Lehner\net al. 2006; Ganguly et al. 2006; Cooksey et al. 2007).\nIn the second pass, we identified absorption systems\nbased on other lines such as multiple H I Lyman series lines or H I + metals (but not O VI). With these\nidentifications in hand, we then searched for either the\nO VI \u03bb1031.93 or the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line at the same\nredshift determined from H I and metal lines. This\nsecond pass identified O VI lines not found in the first\npass for cases in which one of the members of the O VI\ndoublet is blocked by blending with an interloping line\nand cases in which the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected\nbut \u03bb1037.62 is lost in the noise. We have consistently\napplied this line-identification procedure to all of our\nsight lines. Other papers have employed different lineidentification and sample-selection procedures, and the\ndifferent methods can affect statistics such as dN/dz,\nthe number of absorbers per unit redshift. For example, Thom & Chen (2008) note some disagreements with\nour line identifications. These discrepancies partly arise\nbecause in cases where the targets were observed with\nboth STIS and FUSE, Thom & Chen use only the STIS\nobservations, while we use both the STIS and the FUSE\ndata. In the O VI redshift range where STIS and FUSE\ndata overlap, the FUSE spectra often have substantially\nbetter S/N ratios and hence reveal lines that are difficult to detect in the corresponding STIS spectra. We\nalso more comprehensively employ the information provided by the spectra in order to find O VI absorbers.\nDetailed comments about the system identifications, including discrepancies in comparisons with other papers,\nare provided in the Appendix. Of course, lines that are\nmarginally detected can be challenging to identify, and it\nwould be highly informative to obtain higher S/N spectra. Hopefully, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS,\nGreen et al. 1999) will be installed in HST in late 2008\nor early 2009. With this instrument, it will be possible\nto obtain significantly higher S/N UV spectra of low\u2212z\nQSOs.\n2.3. Absorption-Line Measurements\n\n\f6\n\nTripp et al.\n\n2.3.1. Equivalent Widths, Column Densities, Centroids, and\nb\u2212Values\n\nThe complete sample of O VI systems that we have\nidentified in the 16 sight lines is presented in Tables 2\nand 3. The median redshift of the intervening O VI\nsystems in this sample is 0.213, and the proximate absorber median redshift is 0.267. Many of the O VI absorbers show multiple components (see examples below),\nand the O VI lines can be offset in velocity from lowerionization transitions in the same absorber. In this paper, the \"system\" redshift is defined to be the redshift\nof the centroid of the strongest individual component detected in the O VI profiles. We use two complementary\nmethods to measure the absorption-line properties: (1)\ndirect apparent optical depth integration, and (2) Voigtprofile fitting. We employ both methods because they\neach have advantages and disadvantages, and comparison of measurements from each technique provides an\nindication of the uncertainty introduced by various systematics. Detailed notes on line identification issues as\nwell as comments and warnings regarding hot pixels, line\nblending, and line saturation in individual absorbers are\nprovided in the Appendix of this paper. For convenience,\nthe comments in the Appendix are cross-referenced to the\nentries in Table 3: the number listed in the final column\nof Table 3 corresponds to the comment number in the\nAppendix.\nTable 2 lists the rest-frame equivalent widths and column densities obtained from direct integration of the apparent optical depth of the O VI doublet lines and the\nH I Ly\u03b1 line along with the spectrograph that was used\nto make the measurement. Note that for H I, we mainly\nlist the directly integrated measurements of the Ly\u03b1 line\nin Table 2. Because it is the most frequently detected\ntransition in quasar spectra, the Ly\u03b1 equivalent width\nis often used as a fiducial measurement when comparing absorbers. However, the Ly\u03b1 line is often strong\nand saturated, and in that case, better measurements of\nthe H I column density are provided by the Voigt-profile\nfits to multiple H I Lyman series lines presented below.\nTo measure the directly integrated equivalent widths and\ncolumn densities, we use the methods of Sembach & Savage (1992) including their formalism for evaluating the\ncontribution from continuum placement uncertainty and\nflux zero level uncertainty in the overall error budget of\nthe measurements. Advantages of direct integration are\nthat the measurements are straightforward, easily implemented, and relatively objective; profile fitting, in contrast, can yield different results depending on the number\nof components that are fitted to the profiles of interest.\nDisadvantages of direct line integration are that it does\nnot disentangle significantly blended components, and if\na line is affected by saturation (which is sometimes unresolved), direct integration underestimates the line column density.\nHowever, we can check for unresolved saturation by\ncomparing the \"apparent\" column density profiles (Savage & Sembach 1991; Jenkins 1996) of two or more transitions of a species with significantly different f \u03bb values.\nTo construct an apparent column density profile, we first\ncalculate the apparent optical depth \u03c4a (v) in each pixel\n\nof an absorption profile as a function of velocity,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nIc (v)\n,\n\u03c4a (v) = ln\nIob (v)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ic (v) is the estimated continuum intensity in the\npixel at velocity v and Iob (v) is the observed intensity in\nthat same pixel. To estimate the continuum shape and\nintensity, we fit a low-order Legendre polynomial fitted\nto line-free regions of the spectrum in the \u00b11000 km s\u22121\ninterval centered on the absorption line of interest. The\napparent column density is then determined from the\napparent optical depth,\nme c \u03c4a (v)\n\u03c4a (v)\nNa (v) =\n= 3.768 \u00d7 1014\n,\n(2)\n\u03c0e2 f \u03bb\nf\u03bb\nwhere f is the oscillator strength and \u03bb is the wavelength\nof the transition, and the other symbols have their usual\nmeanings. The numerical coefficient in eqn. 2 requires a\nwavelength measured in \u00c5 and produces an Na (v) profile\nin atoms cm\u22122 (km s\u22121 )\u22121 . Na (v) is a representation of\nthe true column density profile broadened by the instrument line spread function. If the line is fully resolved\nby the instrument, then Na (v) can be integrated to determine the total column density. Even if the line is not\nwell-resolved, the total column can still be measured reliably provided that the profile is not significantly affected\nby unresolved saturation. If two or more lines with log f \u03bb\ndiffering by 0.3 dex or more are compared and the Na (v)\nprofiles are found to be in agreement, then the profiles are\nnot badly affected by saturation and can beRintegrated to\nmeasure the total column density, Ntotal = Na (v)dv. If,\nconversely, the Na (v) profiles are affected by saturation,\nthen weaker lines will indicate higher apparent columns\nthan their corresponding stronger lines in the velocity\nrange affected by saturation. Apparent column density\nprofiles have additional virtues as we will discuss in \u00a73.4.\nSince direct integration does not separate blended components, we list the total column densities, integrated\nacross all components within an absorption feature, in\nTable 2. For the measurements of individual component\nproperties, we employ the Voigt profile fitting code developed by Fitzpatrick & Spitzer (1997) with the STIS\nE140M line-spread functions from the STIS Handbook\n(Kim Quijano et al. 2003). We fit all transitions from a\nparticular species (e.g., the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62\ntransitions) simultaneously and obtain a single set of velocity centroids, column densities, and Doppler parameters for the components in the profiles of that species.\nDifferent species (e.g., H I vs. O VI or C III vs. O VI)\ncan exist in separate gas phases and therefore are fitted independently. Table 3 lists the velocity centroids,\nDoppler parameters (b\u2212values), and column densities of\nindividual components detected in each O VI absorption system (some O VI absorbers show only one component, but many of the systems have multiple components). For cross referencing with the profile-fitting\nresults, column 6 in Table 2 lists the number of components that are identified within each H I and O VI\nprofile and their velocity centroids. Voigt profile fitting\nis a valuable measurement technique, but it is important\nto recognize the limitations and systematic uncertainties inherent in the method. Components that are free\nfrom blending, or components that are within blends but\nhave a distinctive and well-constrained Gaussian shape\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n2.0\n\n7\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n1.5\n\nFlux (10\u221214 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121)\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\nPKS0312\u2212770\nzabs = 0.20266\n\n0.0\n1230\n\n8\n\n1235\n\n1240\n\n1245\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n\n1250\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1220\n\nPHL1811\nzabs = 0.19186\n1225\n\n1230\nObserved Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n1235\n\n1240\n\nFig. 1.- Examples of strong O VI absorbers detected in STIS E140M echelle spectra of low\u2212redshift QSOs.

Toward PKS0312-770, a strong\nO VI system is detected at zabs = 0.20266, and toward PHL1811 a multicomponent O VI absorber is found at zabs = 0.19186. The tick\nmarks also show the positions of the corresponding H I Ly\u03b2 absorption regardless of whether it is detected.\n\nin optical depth, are generally well-constrained by profile fitting. However, many components are revealed by\nwell-detected but strongly blended inflections and profile\nasymmetries, and extra components that fit profile inflections/asymmetries are sometimes required to obtain\nan acceptable fit. Profile-fitting results for such blended\ncomponents can be sensitive to the number of components selected to fit the profile. In these cases, the main\n(strongest) components are usually well-constrained, but\nthe parameters of the \"inflection\" components can be\nsensitive to the number of components chosen for the fit.\nComponents that are poorly constrained due to problems such as severe blending with adjacent components,\nsignificant saturation of all available lines, or low S/N\nare marked with a colon in Table 3. However, it is important to bear in mind that fitting results for complex\nmulticomponent profiles can change considerably if more\n(or fewer) components are used in the fit. As emphasized by Spitzer & Fitzpatrick (1995) and Fitzpatrick\n& Spitzer (1997), the parameter uncertainties estimated\nby this Voigt profile fitting code increase appropriately\nwhen components are strongly blended, but the code cannot fully account for typical sources of systematic error.\nIn our analyses below, we will consider how additional\n\nsystematic uncertainties could affect our results.\n2.3.2. Alignment of O VI and H I Components\n\nIn our previous papers on low\u2212z O VI absorbers, we\nhave found that some O VI and H I components are\nremarkably well-aligned, and in some cases the narrow\nwidth of the aligned H I indicates a surprisingly low\ntemperature (e.g., Tripp & Savage 2000; Lehner et al.\n2006; Tripp et al. 2006a). We will revisit this aspect\nof the O VI systems with the larger sample of this paper in \u00a74.1.1. We quantitatively identify aligned components based on the velocity difference between the\nO VI and H I component centroids, \u2206v(H I-O VI), and\nthe uncertainty in that velocity difference, \u03c3(\u2206v). We\ncalculate \u03c3(\u2206v) by combining the uncertainties in the\nO VI and H I component velocity centroids (from Table 3) in quadrature along with a term (\u03c3wavecal ) to account for the uncertainy\nin the wavelength scale calip\n2\n2\n2\nbration: \u03c3(\u2206v) = \u03c3O\nVI + \u03c3H I + \u03c3wavecal . As noted\nabove, the STIS and FUSE data have uncertainties in\nthe wavelength-scale zero points as well as the relative\nwavelength calibration across the wavelength range of the\nobservations. We bootstrap calibrated the FUSE data by\ncomparing similar lines in the FUSE and STIS spectra,\n\n\f8\n\nTripp et al.\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nPKS0312-770\nzabs = 0.20266\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\nPHL1811\nzabs = 0.19186\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\nx x x\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1.5\n\nx\n1\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nx\n1.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nC II \u03bb1036.34\n0\n\nC II \u03bb1334.53\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nSi II \u03bb1260.42\n0\n\nSi II \u03bb1260.42\n\n0.0\n\n0\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\n0.0\n\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nFig. 2.- Left: Examples of continuum-normalized absorption profiles detected in the intervening O VI absorber at zabs = 0.20266 in\nthe spectrum of PKS0312-770, including the H I Ly\u03b1, O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62, C II \u03bb1036.34, and Si II \u03bb1260.42 transitions, as labeled.\nUnrelated lines are marked with crosses.

When comparing O VI and H I\ncomponents from STIS data only, we adopt \u03c3wavecal =\n2 km s\u22121 (based on the relative wavelength accuracies\nfrom the STIS Handbook), and when comparing components measured from STIS and FUSE data, we use\n\u03c3wavecal = 5 km s\u22121 . If an O VI and H I component pair\nhave \u2206v(H I-O VI) < 2\u03c3(\u2206v), we consider the components to be aligned. In the majority of the absorbers, the\ncomponent matching is unambiguous: only one H I component is aligned with an O VI component within the\n2\u03c3 velocity difference uncertainty, or the H I and O VI\ncomponents are simply not aligned. However, in a very\nsmall number of cases, an O VI component is aligned\nwith two H I components to within the 2\u03c3 uncertainties.\nIn these cases, we use the components with the smallest\n\u2206v(H I-O VI) for our analysis, but we discuss how such\nambiguities could affect the results. In our analysis of\naligned O VI and H I components, we only use the measurements that are robust; we exclude the components\nthat are marked with a colon in Table 3 because those\nmeasurements suffer from large uncertainties for various\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\nreasons (see Appendix).\nFor convenience, we number the components in each\nabsorption system in column 8 of Table 3, and we indicate whether the O VI and H I components are aligned\nor offset from each other. If the components are aligned,\nwe give the H I and O VI components the same number,\nand if a component is offset, it is given a unique number.\nFor example, in the 3C 249.1 system at zabs = 0.24676,\nwe identify two H I components at v = \u221279 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121\n(component 1) and v = 0 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 (component 2), and\nwe find one O VI component at v = 0 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 . The\nO VI component is aligned with H I component 2, and\nthus the O VI component is also identified as component\n2. By using the same component numbers for aligned\nH I and O VI cases, the reader can easily identify which\ncomponents are matched together from Table 3.\n2.4. Absorber Classification\n2.4.1. Single-Phase/Simple vs. Multiphase/Complex\nAbsorbers\n\nIt is useful to classify the low\u2212z O VI absorbers in\nvarious ways. To motivate the classifications used in this\npaper, we begin with some examples of the absorptionline systems that demonstrate their diverse characteristics and categories. Two examples of strong O VI absorbers identified in our STIS spectra are shown in Figure 1. This figure shows small portions of the STIS spectra of PKS0312-770 and PHL1811 covering O VI systems\nat zabs = 0.20266 and 0.19186, respectively. The examples in Figure 1 demonstrate the tremendous diversity of\nlow\u2212z O VI absorbers: from Tables 2 and 3, we see that\nthe O VI column densities are similar in these PKS0312770 and PHL1811 systems, but the N (H I)/N (O VI)\nratio is ostensibly & 104 times larger in the PKS0312770 example. This can partially be seen by comparing\nthe paucity of H I Ly\u03b2 absorption in the PHL1811 case\nto the strongly saturated, multicomponent Ly\u03b2 profile\nin the PKS0312-770 system. There are several reasons\nthat O VI absorbers can show such a large range in the\nH I/O VI ratio. First, when good constraints are available, it has been shown that the metallicities15 of apparently intergalactic, low\u2212z QSO absorbers span a large\nrange from Z = 0.02 \u2212 0.06Z\u2299 (e.g., Tripp et al. 2002,\n2005) up to Z = 0.5 \u2212 1.0Z\u2299 (e.g., Savage et al. 2002;\nProchaska et al. 2004; Jenkins et al. 2005; Aracil et\nal. 2006). If the metallicity varies by a factor of 50, the\nH I/O VI ratio will vary by a similar ratio. Second, the\nH I/O VI ratio is very sensitive to the ionization conditions. As we will discuss in detail in \u00a74, in collisional ionization equilibrium, for example, relatively small changes\nin the gas temperature can lead to large changes in the\nH I/O VI ratio. Similarly, in photoionized gas, small\nchanges in the gas density, ionizing flux, or ionizing radiation field shape can lead to substantial changes in the\nH I/O VI ratio. Third, many of the O VI absorbers are\nmultiphase absorbers. Lower-ionization phases can substantially increase the H I absorption strength without\nincreasing the O VI strength at all.\nIndeed, looking more closely at the examples in Figure 1, we can find strong evidence that multiphase effects\n15\n\nIn this paper, we use the usual notation for logarithmic metallicity, i.e., [X/H] = log (X/Y) - log (X/Y)\u2299 , and we express linear\nmetallicities with the variable Z.\n\n9\n\ncontribute to the huge difference in the H I/O VI ratios\nin these particular cases. Figure 2 shows the continuumnormalized absorption profiles of selected H I, O VI, C II,\nand Si II transitions in the PKS0312-770 and PHL1811\nabsorbers. Strong, multicomponent C II and Si II absorption is clearly detected in the PKS0312-770 system,\nbut these low ions are not evident in the PHL1811 absorber. Moreover, the profiles of the C II and Si II lines\nin the PKS0312-770 case are quite similar to each other\nwith at least three distinct components, two of which are\nrelatively narrow. Figure 3 shows a closer look at some\nof the PKS0312-770 metal lines (over a smaller velocity\nrange). From this figure, we immediately see that the\nO VI component structure differs from the low-ion component structure. The O VI absorption extends over a\nsimilar velocity range but does not show the three distinct components seen in C II and Si II. This indicates\neither that the O VI lines originate in a different phase\nor that additional components are present in the O VI\nprofile that blend together and smear out the component\nstructure; either explanation requires at least some of the\nO VI absorption to arise in separate phases from the low\nions. The former explanation is more natural: if the O VI\nabsorption arises in hotter gas (as expected since it peaks\nin abundance at T \u2248 105.5 K in collisionally ionized\np gas),\nits Doppler parameter b will be broader (b = 2kT /m,\nwhere T is the temperature and m is the atomic mass)\nand the O VI components would hence be more blended\nas seen in Figure 3. It is worthwhile to note that some\nhigh-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the vicinity of the Milky\nWay have similar characteristics to the profiles shown in\nFigure 3, i.e., O VI and low-ion absorption spread over\nthe same velocity range but with somewhat different centroids and/or line widths (see, e.g., Sembach et al. 2003;\nTripp et al. 2003; Fox et al. 2004,2006; Ganguly et al.\n2005; Collins et al. 2007).\nIt is not surprising to conclude that O VI and lowion lines originate in different phases; this is expected\nintuitively because these species exist mainly in very different temperature ranges in collisionally ionized gas in\nequilibrium (e.g., Bryans et al. 2006).16 A more surprising result is that we also find that a substantial fraction\nof our O VI absorbers show similar O VI and H I profiles\nsuggestive of single-phase clouds. We show four examples of intervening O VI absorbers in Figure 4. In these\nfour examples, we detect both O VI and H I with good\nsignificance, and the O VI and H I lines are well-aligned\nand have similar shapes. In these aligned systems, the\nH I/O VI ratio varies significantly from one system to\nthe next (and the ratio even varies among components\nwithin a single absorber as, e.g., in the zabs = 0.31658\nsystem toward 3C 351.0), but it is critical to notice how\nthe O VI and H I centroids are well-aligned in velocity,\nand the profile shapes are quite similar (but are not identical). This suggests that the O VI and H I originate in a\nsingle gas phase in these cases and provides an important\nconstraint on the physical conditions of the gas (as we\nwill discuss further in \u00a74).\nMotivated by the mixture of evidence regarding the\nnumber of phases in the O VI absorbers, we have classi16 However, O VI and low-ion lines can arise in a single phase in\nnon-equilibrium collisional ionization (\u00a74.1.2 ) or photoionized gas\n(\u00a74.1.3) under the right conditions.\n\n\f10\n\nTripp et al.\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n(b)\n\n3C 273\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n3C 351.0\nzabs = 0.31658\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\nzabs = 0.12003\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\nx\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0.0\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\n1.0\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\n0.5\n\n0\n4\n\n0.0\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\n3\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nFig. 4.- Examples of continuum-normalized absorption profiles (black lines) of H I and O VI absorption lines detected in intervening\nabsorbers.

These classifications are listed in column 2 of Table 3. In a few absorbers, the primary components are\naligned in the O VI and H I profiles, but weak components are detected in H I that do not show corresponding\nO VI. An example of such a system is shown in Figure 5.\nIn this absorber in the spectrum of 3C 249.1, we see that\nthe main component at v = 0 km s\u22121 is well-aligned in\nH I and O VI, but an additional, rather weak H I component that shows no O VI is evident at v = \u221279 km\ns\u22121 . The H I Ly\u03b1 transition is very sensitive to lowdensity, low-N (H I) gas, and when N (H I) is very low,\nit is likely that any associated O VI absorption is simply\ntoo weak to be detected at the S/N level of our data.\nIn cases where the bulk of the H I and O VI absorption\n\nis aligned but weak H I components are present with no\ncorresponding O VI (as in Figure 5), we classify the absorber as a simple case, but we mark the system with\nan asterisk in Table 3 to note the presence of weak H I\nwithout corresponding O VI. In some instances, the H I\nprofiles and component centroids are poorly constrained,\ne.g., if the absorber is a black Lyman-limit system presenting only badly saturated Lyman series lines or if H I\nis not detected at all (as found in several systems near\nthe QSO redshifts); in these cases, we list the classification as uncertain. In the intervening absorber sample,\nwe classify 37% of the absorbers as simple (single-phase)\nsystems and 53% as complex (multiphase) systems (10%\nhave uncertain classifications).\nTo show the quantitative distinction between the simple (single-phase) and complex (multiphase) intervening absorbers, we show in Figure 6 the velocity offsets\nbetween H I and O VI components, \u2206v(H I - O VI)\n= vH I \u2212 vO VI .

From this figure, we\nsee that there is a clear kinematical distinction between\nsimple/single-phase and complex/multiphase absorbers:\nsome of our O VI absorbers are characterized by highlyaligned O VI and H I components, but an equally large\nfraction of the intervening systems have more complex\nrelationships between H I and O VI with significantly\ndifferent kinematics. We will return to this distinction\nbelow.\n2.4.2. Intervening vs. Proximate/Intrinsic Absorbers\n17 As we show in \u00a72.4.2, some of the proximate absorbers with\nzabs \u2248 zQSO are detected in the O VI doublet without any affiliated H I absorption. In contrast, in the intervening systems there\nare often clear velocity offsets between the O VI and H I absorption components, but we always find at least some significant H I\nabsorption within \u00b1100 km s\u22121 of the O VI.\n\nWe classify the absorbers a second way for an orthogonal purpose: we list in column 2 of Table 3 whether\nthe system is classified as an intervening absorber (Int)\nor a proximate absorber (Prox). It has long been recognized that some of the so-called \"associated\" absorption\nsystems (often called \"proximate\" absorbers in the recent literature) close to the redshift of the background\nQSO (zabs \u2248 zQSO ) have a fundamentally different nature from intervening absorbers that arise in the IGM or\nISM of foreground objects (e.g., Lynds 1967; Burbidge\n1970; Foltz et al. 1986). The \"broad-absorption line\"\n(BAL) QSOs are easily recognized by their dramatic P\nCygni-like absorption troughs with outflow velocities approaching a substantial fraction of the speed of light (see,\ne.g., Turnshek 1988), but apart from BAL QSOs, there\nis a statistical excess of metal-bearing absorbers within\n\u2248 5000 km s\u22121 of zQSO (Foltz et al. 1986) that in many\nregards look like the ordinary, narrow absorption lines\nthat arise in foreground galaxies and the IGM. However,\nevidence such as temporal variability (on timescales of a\nfew years) and/or incomplete covering of the background\nflux source indicates that at least some \"narrow\" absorption lines originate in material located quite close to the\n\n\f12\n\nTripp et al.\n1.5\n\n1\n\nNumber of Component Pairs\n\nWeak component\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3C 249.1\nzabs = 0.24676\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nx\nH I Ly\u03b2\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\nIntervening\nAbsorbers\n\nSimple\nComplex\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u221250\n\n0.0\n\n0\n50\nvH I \u2212 vO VI (km s\u22121)\n\nFig. 6.- Velocity offsets between H I and O VI components\nin intervening absorbers measured in simple (single-phase) systems (hatched thin line) and complex (multiphase) absorbers (thick\nline).

Apart from the labeled weak H I\ncomponent at v = \u221279 km s\u22121 , the O VI and H I profiles are\nquite similar. Given the range of H I/O VI ratios found in O VI\nsystems, any O VI associated with the weak component is likely\nto be undetectable at this signal-to-noise level. We classify this\nabsorber as \"simple*\" (\u00a72.4.1) to indicate that the majority of the\nO VI and H I profiles are well-aligned and can be analyzed as a\nsingle-phase system. As in Figure 4, the lowest panel compares the\nNa (v) profiles of the O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93,1037.62 lines, and unrelated\nlines from other redshifts are marked with an \u00d7.

(1979)\nand Foltz et al. (1986), narrow absorption lines found\nwithin 5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshift are usually classified as associated (proximate) absorbers, and we adhere to this standard definition in this paper (however,\nin some cases we show how the measurements change if\nwe change the velocity cutoff for the proximate absorber\nclassification). The velocity of displacement vdispl must\naccount for relativistic effects but can be easily determined from the QSO and absorber redshifts using the\n\nWe also distinguish between associated absorbers and\n\"mini-BAL\" systems. Mini-BALs show many of the characteristics of BALs but are spread over a smaller velocity\nrange (e.g., Barlow et al. 1997). One of our sight lines\n(3C 351.0) shows a clear example of a mini-BAL with\nstrong evidence that the absorption lines arise in intrinsic material close to the QSO. This is clearly a different\ntype of absorption system, and we do not include it in\nour samples. A full analysis of the 3C 351.0 mini-BAL\nhas been presented by Yuan et al. (2002).\nHowever, the 5000 km s\u22121 velocity interval used to define proximate absorbers corresponds to a relatively large\nHubble-flow distance, and it is inevitable that some truly\nintervening absorbers will be classified as associated just\nbecause they are located in the 5000 km s\u22121 region of\nspace near the QSO; indeed, Sembach et al. (2004) show\nexamples of this problem (see their \u00a710). On the other\nhand, compelling direct evidence of narrow absorption\nsystems associated with the QSO with vdispl \u226b 5000 km\ns\u22121 has been found at high redshifts; Hamann, Barlow,\n& Junkkarinen (1997) reported clear temporal variability\nand partial coverage of the flux source in an absorber displaced by \u224824,000 km s\u22121 from the emission redshift of\nQ2343+125 (zQSO = 2.24), for example. Based on statistical excesses of absorbers observed toward different\ntypes of QSOs, Richards et al. (1999,2001) have argued\nthat up to 36% of C IV absorbers at zabs \u223c 2.5 with\n5000 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 75,000 km s\u22121 arise in ejected material\nintrinsic to the background QSO. More recently, Misawa et al. (2007) have searched for partial coverage in\nnarrow metal-line absorbers detected in high-resolution\nKeck spectra of 37 high\u2212z QSOs, and they conclude that\n10 \u2212 17% of narrow C IV absorbers are intrinsic (associated with the QSO) in the 5000 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 75,000 km\ns\u22121 interval.\nEvidently, displacement velocity might not provide a\nstraightforward means of distinguishing between intervening and intrinsic absorbers.

To avoid the confusing connotations of the term \"associated\", in this paper\nwe will follow recent papers (e.g., Ellison et al. 2002;\nRussell et al. 2006; Hennawi & Prochaska 2007) and refer to any absorber with vdispl \u2264 5000 km s\u22121 as a \"proximate\" absorber regardless of its nature/origin, but we\nuse \"intrinsic\" to connote that the system is physically\nclose to the QSO. It is important to bear in mind the\npossible confusion that intrinsic systems could cause in\nsamples of intervening systems defined based on vdispl .\nBecause nearby galaxy redshifts are more straightforwardly measured, an advantage of low\u2212z samples is that\nif 10 \u2212 30% of the systems in the 5000 \u2212 75, 000 km s\u22121\ninterval are intrinsic/ejected, we should find that this\nfraction of the metal systems are randomly distributed\nwith respect to the foreground galaxies. Studies of correlations between metal systems and foreground galaxies so\nfar have not found any evidence of randomly distributed\nmetal systems; instead, the metal absorbers appear to\nbe clearly correlated with galaxies (e.g., Savage, Tripp,\n& Lu 1998; Tripp & Savage 2000; Savage et al. 2002;\n\nSembach et al. 2004; Tumlinson et al. 2005; Prochaska\net al. 2006; Stocke et al. 2006; Williger et al. 2006;\nAracil et al. 2006; Tripp et al. 2006a). We are currently\nexpanding the sample of sight lines for low\u2212z galaxyabsorber correlation analyses, but this investigation will\nbe presented in a separate paper. In this paper, however, we will search for any evidence that some of the\nO VI absorbers at 5000 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 75,000 km s\u22121 have\ncharacteristics that indicate an ejected/intrinsic origin.\nWe will find that in our sample, ejected/intrinsic systems appear to be predominantly confined to vdispl .\n2500 km s\u22121 (see \u00a73).\nFigure 7 shows several examples of the proximate O VI\nabsorbers that we have identified in the 16 sight lines\nstudied in this paper. This figure shows that some of\nthe proximate systems have characteristics that are quite\nsimilar to those of the intervening systems. For example,\nthe proximate absorbers of 3C 249.1 (at zabs = 0.30811)\nand PG0953+415 (zabs = 0.23351) have strong H I lines\nas well as O VI, and the H I and O VI lines are wellaligned.

The HS0624+6907\nand TON28 proximate systems in Figure 7 are two examples of proximate systems with very weak H I. In several cases, H I is not detected at all despite good S/N.\nAs noted in the previous section, some intervening systems show substantial velocity offsets between the H I\nand O VI absorption, but intervening systems almost\nalways show some detectable H I absorption in the vicinity of the O VI. As we will discuss further below, one\nunique characteristic of the proximate systems is that\nsome show no affiliated H I absorption whatsoever. Using the same classification criteria discussed above, we\ncategorize 21% of the proximate absorbers as \"simple\"\nsystems composed of O VI and H I components that\nare aligned, and 50% of the proximate systems are complex.18\n3. STATISTICS\n3.1. Number of O VI Absorbers per Unit Redshift\n18 The proximate absorber sample is smaller and a larger fraction\nof the proximate absorbers have uncertain classifications, hence a\nsubstantial portion of these absorbers (29% ) are not classified.\n\nWe now turn to the statistical properties of the intervening and proximate absorbers presented in Tables 2\nand 3. We begin with the number of O VI absorbers per\nunit redshift, dN/dz. This is a fundamental quantity\nthat characterizes the various types of QSO absorbers.\nMoreover, it is straightforward to use theoretical models and simulations to predict dN/dz for O VI absorbers\n(e.g., Cen et al. 2001; Fang & Bryan 2001; Chen et al.\n2003; Furlanetto et al. 2005; Tumlinson & Fang 2005;\nCen & Fang 2006), and measurement of dN/dz provides\nan important test of the validity of these large-scale cosmological models.\n3.1.1. dN/dz Measurement Method and Uncertainties\n\nTo estimate dN/dz for a sample of absorbers with\nequivalent widths greater than a specified limiting equivalent width Wlim , we simply tabulate the number of O VI\nsystems detected with Wr \u2265 Wlim and divide by the total\npath \u2206z over which we were able to search for the absorbers. However, there are a few minor complications\nin this simple calculation. First, the S/N ratios of our\nspectra are not completely uniform; some sight lines have\nhigher over S/N ratios than others, and even along a single sight line, some wavelength regions have higher S/N.\n\n\fFlux (10\u221214 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121)\n\nIGM O VI Statistics\n\n3C 249.1\n\nz = 0.24676\n\n6\n\nz = 0.30811\n\n4\n\nz = 0.31364\n2\n(Ly\u03b2 + O VI)\n\n0\n3.0\n\nlog [Limiting Wobs (m\u00c5)]\n\n15\n\n(Ly\u03b1 + N V)\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n1200\n\n1300\n\n1400\n1500\nObserved Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n1600\n\n1700\n\nFig. 8.- Example of the sensitivity of our STIS E140M data. The top panel shows the STIS E140M spectrum of 3C 249.1, binned to\n\u224835 km s\u22121 pixels to show the continuum shape and emission lines clearly. QSO broad emission lines are labeled in parentheses underneath\nthe spectrum. The bars and tickmarks show the locations of the intervening O VI absorbers at zabs = 0.23641 and 0.24676 as well as the\nproximate O VI systems at zabs = 0.30811 and 0.31364. For each system, the ticks indicate the redshifted wavelengths of the C III \u03bb977.02,\nH I Ly\u03b2, O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62, and H I Ly\u03b1 lines from left to right, respectively. The thick bars are the intervening cases; the thin bars\nmark the proximate systems. The lower panel shows the 3\u03c3 limiting equivalent width obtained by integrating the full-resolution data over\n15-pixel windows. The sawtooth pattern in the limiting equivalent width is due to the blaze function of the echelle grating, which causes\nthe S/N of the spectrum to vary significantly across a given echelle order. This is mitigated in some regions because adjacent echelle orders\noverlap, and coaddition of the overlapping regions offsets the lower S/N at the edges of the echelle orders. The large positive spikes are due\nto strong interstellar or intergalactic absorption lines, which block portions of the spectrum and prevent the detection of weak extragalactic\nlines within the wavelength range of the strong absorption profile. The measured equivalent widths of the detected O VI \u03bb1031.93 lines in\nthe intervening and proximate O VI systems are shown with filled circles and open squares, respectively, in the lower panel.\n\nSecond, some redshifts are blocked by strong Galactic\nISM lines or unrelated extragalactic lines. These blocked\nregions reduce the total \u2206z that is effectively searched\nfor absorption systems. The total \u2206z and number of absorbers in a given sample must carefully account for the\nvariable S/N and blocking of the spectra. For example,\nsuppose that a line with Wr = 150 m\u00c5 is detected in a\nspectral region with S/N that is only sufficient to detect\nlines with Wr \u2265 100 m\u00c5. That region would not be included in the total \u2206z for a sample with Wr \u2265 30 m\u00c5,\nand thus the 150 m\u00c5 line cannot be counted in a Wr \u2265 30\nm\u00c5 sample. However, this absorber would be included\nin a sample with Wr \u2265 100 m\u00c5or larger.\nTo account for the variable S/N of the data and blocking by unrelated lines, we calculate for each sight line the\nrest-frame 3\u03c3 limiting equivalent width at each observed\nwavelength \u03bb where O VI absorbers can be detected,\n3\u03c3W (\u03bb)\nWlim (\u03bb) =\n,\n(4)\n1 + zabs\nwhere \u03c3W (\u03bb) is the total uncertainty in an equivalent\nwidth integrated over some number of pixels. For a single\n\npixel i, the equivalent width uncertainty \u03c3W (i) is\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c3I(\u03bbi )\n,\n\u03c3W (i) = \u2206\u03bb(i)\nI(\u03bbi )\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bb(i) is the pixel width, I(\u03bbi ) is the flux in pixel i,\nand \u03c3I(\u03bbi ) is the 1\u03c3 flux uncertainty in pixel i. However,\nboth the STIS and FUSE data have at least two pixels\nper resolution element, and in fact, all of the clearly detected O VI lines are spread over at least several 2-pixel\nresolution elements. Therefore, to evaluate Wlim (\u03bb), we\nmust integrate over n pixels,\n2\n\u03c3W\n(\u03bb) =\n\nn\nX\n\n2\n\u03c3W\n(i) .\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nFor a given limiting equivalent width, we have empirically determined the number of pixels to integrate over\nbased on the detected O VI lines with measured equivalent widths close to the limiting equivalent width of interest (see further details below). After Wlim (\u03bb) has been\nevaluated over the full range of O VI coverage for all 16\n\n\fTripp et al.\n\nsight lines, we evaluate \u2206z for various samples of lines\nwith strengths greater than Wr by summing the total\nredshift path over which Wlim (\u03bb) \u2264 Wr . We first check\nfor detectability of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line when evaluating the total \u2206z. When O VI \u03bb1031.93 is redshifted into\na region blocked by a strong ISM or extragalactic line,\nour algorithm checks whether the corresponding O VI\n\u03bb1037.62 can be detected instead. O VI \u03bb1037.62 is\nredshifted to a different observed wavelength, and the\ndifferent observed \u03bb usually places \u03bb1037.62 outside of\nthe blocked region. However, because of its lower f \u03bb\nvalue, the O VI \u03bb1037.62 is expected to be a factor of\ntwo weaker than \u03bb1031.93, so when checking the corresponding \u03bb1037.62 region, we require Wlim (\u03bb) \u2264 0.5Wr\nin order to add to the total \u2206z (e.g., if we cannot detect\na 30 m\u00c5 O VI \u03bb1031.93 line, we have to be able to detect\na 15 m\u00c5 O VI \u03bb1037.62 line instead). In this way, we\nestimate the total path over which we can detect either\nO VI \u03bb1031.93 or O VI \u03bb1037.63. This approach also\naccounts for regions with steep S/N gradients (e.g., in\nthe vicinity of the broad QSO emission lines) that might\nmake one line of the doublet detectable while the other\nlines falls below the detection threshold.\nFigure 8 shows an example of the resulting limiting\nequivalent width calculated for equivalent widths greater\nthan 30 m\u00c5 for the STIS observations of 3C 249.1. The\ntop panel of Figure 8 shows the 3C 249.1 STIS spectrum (binned to \u2248 35 km s\u22121 pixels to more clearly\nshow the characteristics of the spectrum), and the lower\npanel shows the 3\u03c3 limiting equivalent width obtained\nby integrating over 15-pixel detection windows (15 fullresolution, unbinned pixels). Figure 8 shows several important characteristics of the data that deserve comment.\nFirst, the proper calculation of Wlim (\u03bb) automatically\ncorrects for portions of the spectra that are blocked by\nstrong interstellar or extragalactic lines. In these regions,\nthe S/N drops precipitously and Wlim (\u03bb) increases accordingly; if neither the \u03bb1031.93 line nor the \u03bb1037.62\nline falls in a region with sufficient sensitivity, then that\nredshift window does not contribute to the total \u2206z.\nIn addition, when moderate strength lines are present,\nWlim (\u03bb) increases, but these locations can add to \u2206z for\nsamples of stronger lines. For example, a contaminating\n150 m\u00c5 ISM line might effectively hide a 30 m\u00c5 extragalactic O VI line, but it would not hide a 300 m\u00c5 O VI\nline, and this is properly evaluated using this approach.\nSecond, the S/N and Wlim (\u03bb) are not uniform across a\nSTIS E140M spectrum for several reasons. The STIS\nE140M sensitivity peaks at \u03bbobs \u22481340 \u00c5 and decreases\nat shorter and longer wavelengths. However, superimposed on this broad and slowly-varying sensitivity is a\nsawtooth pattern due to the blaze function of the echelle\ngrating: within each echelle order, the S/N decreases significantly when moving away from the blaze peak. This\nis partly mitigated in regions where adjacent orders overlap; in these overlapping regions, coaddition of the two\norders recovers some of the lost signal-to-noise. Given\nthese various effects, it is clear that the limiting equivalent width is a complicated array that is not easily approximated by a simple function. However, our method\nfully accomodates the various sources of sensitivity variations.\nAs can be seen from Figures 1-7 and Tables 2-3, many\n\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\nTotal \u2206z\n\n16\n\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\nlimiting Wr (m\u00c5)\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFig. 9.- The total path (\u2206z) over which the 16 QSO sight lines\nhave sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to detect intervening O VI lines\nwith rest-frame equivalent width Wr \u2265 limiting Wr , calculated as\ndescribed in \u00a73.1. The total \u2206z was explicitly calculated at the\npoints indicated by filled circles, and the solid line shows a spline\nfit that is used to interpolate to find \u2206z at values between the filled\ncircles.\n\nof the O VI systems show multiple (often blended) components spread over 200\u2212500 km s\u22121 intervals. The\nway that the individual components within these blends\nare counted introduces another source of uncertainty in\ndN/dz measurements. For example, the O VI absorber\nat zabs = 0.31658 toward 3C 351.0 shows three blended\n(but clearly detected and distinct) components at vabs\n= \u221251, 0, and 70 km s\u22121 (see Figure 4). Does this case\ncount as one or three absorption systems? These velocity differences correspond to a substantial distance in a\npure Hubble flow, and it is conceivable that the three\ncomponents in this example arise in gas associated with\nthree discrete galaxies. But, the three components could\nalternatively be due to three clouds within the surroundings of a single galaxy. Published theoretical dN/dz\npredictions often do not specify how the absorbers how\ncounted, and indeed, the appropriate method likely depends on the purpose of the dN/dz measurement. This\nissue has greatest impact on our dN/dz measurements\nfor O VI absorbers with the largest equivalent widths;\nthese cases are rare and almost always show evidence\nmultiple components, so spliting the high-Wr cases into\nseveral lower-Wr cases reduces dN/dz for the highest Wr\nbins. To show how this issue affects our results, we report two separate dN/dz measurements. We estimate\ndN/dz for systems, in which we count multiple components that are contiguously connected with each other\nas a single O VI case, and we also determine dN/dz for\ncomponents where every identified individual component\nis counted as a separate case.\n3.1.2. dN/dz Results: Cumulative Distribution\n\nIn Table 4, we report our dN/dz measurements for intervening O VI absorbers for samples with Wr > 30, 70,\n100, 200, and 300 m\u00c5. To determine the limiting equivalent equivalent width and total \u2206z for these bins (as\ndescribed in \u00a73.1.1), we integrate over 15, 22, 30, 50,\nand 70 STIS pixels, respectively.19 For convenience, af19 The number of pixels that we integrate over is based on the\nnumber of pixels spanned by detected O VI features with equivalent\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\nter explicitly calculating \u2206z for these specific limiting Wr\nvalues, we fitted cubic spline functions to the \u2206z vs. limiting Wr data. The total \u2206z values and the cubic spline\nfit for the intervening absorbers are shown in Figure 9.\nFor each intervening sample, Table 4 lists the number of\nO VI systems identified, the total path \u2206z over which\nwe could detect an O VI \u03bb1031.93 line with Wr greater\nthan the limiting value of that sample, and the implied\ndN/dz found by counting either systems (column 4) or\ncomponents (column 5) as explained above.\nTable 5 lists the same quantities but for the proximate\nO VI absorbers. As discussed above, typically associated/proximate absorbers are defined in the literature\nto be any system with vdispl < 5000 km s\u22121 , so we derive dN/dz assuming this standard definition, and the\nresults are shown in the upper half of Table 5. However, we will show below that the excess of proximate\nO VI systems for our sight lines appears to be confined\nto the \u22121000 . vdispl . 2500 km s\u22121 interval, so we\nalso list in Table 5 the results that we obtain by alternatively defining proximate systems to be those found\nwith vdispl \u2264 2500 km s\u22121 . In Tables 4 and 5, we use\nthe Gehrels (1986) small-sample tables to estimate the\nstatistical uncertainties in dN/dz.\nWe now offer several comments on our dN/dz measurements; we compare these results to theoretical predictions in \u00a73.1.4. We begin by comparing our intervening absorber measurements to the O VI dN/dz results\nreported by Danforth & Shull (2005; see also Danforth\net al. 2006). Danforth & Shull (2005) have conducted\na search for O VI lines at zabs < 0.15 in the spectra of\n31 active galactic nuclei observed with FUSE. For their\ndN/dz calculation, Danforth & Shull (2005) count each\ncomponent as a separate case (see Table 3 in Danforth et\nal. 2006), so we should compare our component dN/dz\nresults to the Danforth & Shull (2005) measurements.\nComparing the numbers in column 5 of Table 4 to the\nanalogous quantities from Danforth & Shull's Table 1, we\nsee that the dN/dz measurements from the two papers\nagree within the reported 1 \u2212 2\u03c3 uncertainties. However,\nour dN/dz measurements are systematically higher than\nthose of Danforth & Shull (2005) by roughly 0.1 \u2212 0.3\ndex.\nWe can identify several reasons why we find systematically higher dN/dz values than Danforth & Shull (2005)\nfor intervening O VI systems including the following: (1)\nDanforth & Shull (2005) only searched for O VI affiliated\nwith absorption systems that have H I Ly\u03b1 lines with\nequivalent widths greater than 80 m\u00c5. In our sample, on\nthe other hand, we include all O VI absorbers regardless of the strength of the corresponding H I Ly\u03b1 line.\nFrom Table 2, we see that we do find O VI absorbers\nwith weak corresponding Ly\u03b1 lines with Wr (Ly\u03b1) <80\nm\u00c5. Our inclusion of these weak-Ly\u03b1 O VI absorbers\nincreases dN/dz compared to the results of Danforth &\nShull (2005). (2) We do not classify any absorbers within\n5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshift as an intervening absorber, while Danforth et al. (2006) use 1800 km s\u22121\nas the cutoff for intervening vs. proximate absorbers.\nThe Danforth & Shull proximate absorber definition results in a larger \u2206z searched for intervening O VI per\nsight line, and since we do not find many O VI lines in\nwidths comparable to the limiting equivalent width of interest.\n\n17\n\nthe 1800 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 5000 km s\u22121 interval (see below),\nthis has the net effect of increasing \u2206z palpably without increasing the total number of systems much. Using\nthe 1800 km s\u22121 cutoff therefore decreases dN/dz. If\nwe were to adopt the Danforth & Shull proximate absorber cutoff, our dN/dz measurements would decrease\nby 0.03 dex. (3) Danforth & Shull integrate over a single\nresolution element in order to determine their limiting\nequivalent width. Since very few (if any) of our detected\nO VI systems are completely unresolved and spread over\na single resolution element, we choose to integrate over\na larger number of pixels to determine Wlim as discussed\nabove. This results in higher Wlim in our sample and a\nlower total \u2206z over which our data have sufficient S/N\nto reveal an O VI system of a given strength. If we were\nto also integrate over a single resolution element, our \u2206z\nvalues would increase and our dN/dz numbers would decrease. This issue is most important for the samples that\ninclude the weakest lines (e.g., the Wr \u2265 30 m\u00c5 sample).\nIndividually, these three factors have small effects on the\nmeasured dN/dz, but they all change dN/dz in the same\ndirection when comparing our results to those of Danforth & Shull (2005). The combined effect of these three\nissues can easily account for the systematic difference between our findings and those of Danforth & Shull (2005).\nFigure 10 compares our O VI dN/dz measurements\nto analogous measurements for low\u2212z C IV absorbers\nfrom Frye et al. (2003) and low\u2212z Mg II systems from\nChurchill et al. (1999) and Narayanan et al. (2005).\nAll of the measurements in Figure 10 were derived from\nlow\u2212z samples (zabs < 0.6) except for the Mg II measurement from Churchill et al. (1999), which was derived\nfrom a sample extending to moderately higher redshifts\n(0.4 \u2264 zabs \u2264 1.4). O VI, C IV, and Mg II are the most\ncommonly studied metals in optically-thin QSO absorption systems, and we see from Figure 10 that O VI lines\nhave a substantially higher number per unit z at low\nredshifts than either the Mg II absorbers or the C IV\nsystems. This is not surprising in the case of Mg II;\nthis species is easily photoionized by the UV background\nfrom QSOs, and it is likely to be present only when an\nabsorber has a relatively high H I column density. However, it is interesting to note that dN/dz of O VI is substantially higher than dN/dz of C IV. Because C IV is\noften redshifted outside of the Ly\u03b1 forest, it is by far the\nmost studied metal in the high-redshift regime, and it\nwould be valuable to compare the low\u2212z C IV absorbers\nto their high\u2212z analogs. It is unfortunate that for our\nlow\u2212z O VI absorber sample, the C IV doublet is usually redshifted beyond the long-wavelength cutoff of our\nobservations. However, IGM ionization models can be\nconstrained by the different dN/dz trends for O VI and\nC IV shown in Figure 10.\nFrom Tables 4-5 and Figure 10, we also see that statistically, the O VI dN/dz increases substantially when\nthe absorber redshift range is close to the background\nQSO redshift (compare the open squares and filled circles in Figure 10). Using the standard vdisp < 5000 km\ns\u22121 definition of proximate absorbers, we find that there\nare 2\u22126 times more proximate O VI systems per unit z\nthan intervening O VI systems (we find similar results\ncomparing dN/dz of individual components instead of\ndN/dz of O VI systems). As we have already noted, the\n\n\fTripp et al.\n\n3.1.3. dN/dz Results: Differential Distribution\n\nIn the previous section we discussed the cumulative\ndN/dz distribution of O VI absorbers. We show the\ndifferential O VI dN/dz distribution for intervening\nand proximate absorbers in Figure 11 as a function of\nN (O VI) using 0.2 dex bins extending from log N (O VI)\n= 13.2 to 14.8. In Figure 11, we show the dN/dz that\nresults from counting individual components, and we exclude the marginal measurements (those marked with a\ncolon in Table 3). The total path (\u2206z) for each column\ndensity bin is from Figure 9. As discussed in \u00a73.1.1, we\ncalculate \u2206z as a function of limiting equivalent width.\nTo estimate \u2206z for a limiting column density, we con-\n\n2.0\n\nProximate:\nO VI\n(vdispl <\n2500 km s\u22121)\n\n1.5\nlog [dN/dz]\n\nexcess of O VI lines appears to be largely confined to a\nsmaller velocity interval (vdispl < 2500 km s\u22121 ) closer to\nthe QSO redshift than the standard 5000 km s\u22121 definition (see further discussion below). If we use the 2500 km\ns\u22121 velocity cutoff to define the proximate absorbers, we\nfind an even more dramatic excess: in this case, there are\n3 \u2212 10 times more proximate O VI systems per unit redshift than we find in the intervening sample. The magnitude of the proximate absorber excess depends on the\nsample limiting equivalent width, and it is worth noting\nthat the excess is greatest when comparing the stronger\nO VI lines.\nIt is of interest to assess whether a convenient function,\nsuch as a power law, can be fitted to the O VI dN/dz data\nshown in Figure 10. As shown in Figure 10, for the system dN/dz results, an inverse variance-weighted power\nlaw of the form log dN/dz = \u03b1 log Wlim + constant provides a satisfactory fit for both the intervening and proximate O VI measurements with \u03b1(intervening) = \u22121.00\nand \u03b1(proximate) = \u22120.69. However, we can also see\nfrom Figure 10 that for the intervening systems, the slope\nof the observed log dN/dz vs. log Wlim data appears to\nchange at Wlim < 70 m\u00c5. To show this, we also plot\nin Figure 10 the power law obtained by fitting only the\nbins with Wlim \u2265 70 m\u00c5. Exclusion of the 30 m\u00c5 bin\nresults in a steeper slope and clearly improves the fit to\nthe higher equivalent width bins. This type of turnover\nis sometimes interpreted as evidence of incompleteness,\ni.e., the measured dN/dz is lower than the true dN/dz\nbecause the data were inadequate to detect all of the\nabsorbers in the weakest Wr bin. We argue that this\nexplanation is unlikely to explain the change in slope apparent in our O VI measurements. We have corrected\nfor incompleteness by carefully calculating the total \u2206z\npath over which 30 m\u00c5 lines can be detected. In principle, we could have overestimated \u2206z, e.g., by integrating\nequation 6 over an insufficient number of pixels, which\nin turn would underestimate dN/dz. However, this is an\nunlikely explanation because we would have to overestimate \u2206z by an unreasonable amount to reconcile the intervening O VI data with the steeper power law shown in\nFigure 10. Figure 10 shows the results and fits for O VI\nsystems; as shown in Table 4, if we count components\ninstead of systems, the dN/dz vs. Wlim slope steepens\nsignificantly (single strong systems split up into multiple\nweaker components). Power-law fits to the component\ndN/dz measurements are acceptable for the proximate\nabsorbers, but we find that a single power law provides a\nrather poor description of the dN/dz measurements for\nthe intervening O VI components.\n\n1.0\nIntervening:\nO VI\nC IV\nMg II\n\n0.5\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n1.5\n\n2.0\n2.5\nlog [limiting Wr (m\u00c5)]\n\n3.0\n\nFig. 10.- Measurements of the cumulative number of QSO\nabsorbers per unit redshift (dN/dz) for O VI, C IV, and Mg II absorbers with 1\u03c3 statistical uncertainties.

Comparison with Theoretical dN/dz Predictions for\nIntervening Absorbers\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n20 However, one of the models reported by Chen et al. (2003)\npredicts dN/dz for O VI assuming that the IGM is uniformly enriched to Z = 1.0Z\u2299 . This particular model predicts vastly more\nO VI absorbers than observed, and we do not include this model\nin the range of Chen et al. models shown in Figure 12.\n\n2.0\n1.5\nlog [dN/dz]\n\nMost theoretical studies of the low\u2212z O VI absorbers\nhave made predictions regarding the cumulative dN/dz\ndistribution, so we focus on the cumulative distribution\nin our comparison to theoretical work. It is not clear\nif there is a physical motivation for fitting the dN/dz\ndata in Figure 10 with a power law. Some theoretical\npapers have argued that dN/dz vs. Wlim should turn\nover as Wlim decreases. For example, Tumlinson & Fang\n(2005) suggest that this turnover could be a result of the\nprocesses that transport metals out of galaxies. They\nargue that if galaxies can only pollute metals into limited\nvolumes in their immediate vicinities, then dN/dz should\nturnover as observed. In their recent survey of low\u2212z\nO VI absorber environments, Stocke et al. (2006) find no\nO VI systems in galaxy voids, which is consistent with\nthe Tumlinson & Fang (2005) hypothesis.\nCosmological simulations also predict a dN/dz\nturnover. Several papers have employed hydrodynamic\nsimulations of large-scale structure growth to predict the\nnumber of O VI absorbers per unit redshift for various\nsamples of intervening absorbers defined by the limiting equivalent width. We compare these theoretical predictions to our measurements in Figure 12. The earlier\npredictions of Cen et al. (2001) are superseded by the\nmore recent predictions of Cen & Fang (2006), so we do\nnot show the Cen et al. (2001) predictions in Figure 12.\nAlso, Chen et al. (2003) and Cen & Fang (2006) have presented predictions for multiple models that make different assumptions about, e.g., the processes that transport\nmetals out of galaxies, nonequilibrium ionization effects,\nand the overall level and scatter of the IGM metallicity.\nCurrent cosmological simulations have limited ability to\nfully model complicated processes such as metal transport, and it should be borne in mind that significantly\nuncertain assumptions are sometimes required to predict\nstatistics of metal absorption line systems from hydrodynamic simulations. For this reason, we do not show the\npredictions of individual models in Figure 12 but instead\nuse hatched regions to show the range of dN/dz predictions for intervening O VI systems from several theoretical papers, i.e., the lower envelope of the hatched\nregion shows the lowest prediction from the indicated\npaper, and the upper envelope indicates the highest prediction.20\nAs we have already noted, it is not always clear how\nthe O VI absorbers are counted in the cosmological simulation papers. Chen et al. (2003) note that they do\nnot attempt to deblend blended lines, so for comparison to their predictions, the system dN/dz measurements\nfrom column (4) of Table 4 should be employed. Other\nsimulation papers employ Voigt-profile fitting (e.g., Fang\n& Bryan 2001), so for those predictions, the component\ndN/dz should be used. In Figure 12, we show the measurements of the O VI redshift density counting systems\n(filled circles) and components (double squares). Overall,\nwe see broad but imperfect agreement between the simulation predictions and the observations. The simulations\npredict that the dN/dz distribution should turnover with\ndecreasing Wlim as observed. The Chen et al.

The observations are indicated by points with 1\u03c3 statistical error bars; filled circles show the\nresults obtained by counting blended components as a single \"system\", and double squares show the dN/dz measurements found\nby counting each component (including components that are close\nin velocity and blended) as a separate case. Chen et al. (2003)\nand Cen & Fang (2006) present a variety of models that vary the\nphysics implementations and assumptions. The hatched regions\nindicate the range of dN/dz predicted by their models.\n\nmodels predict too many O VI systems at Wlim . 70\nm\u00c5 but roughly agree with the observations at higher\nequivalent width limits. The Cen & Fang (2006) model\nthat results in the highest O VI redshift density (i.e.,\ntheir model that includes galactic superwinds but neglects nonequilibrium ionization effects) agrees with the\nmeasurements for weak O VI systems but underpredicts\nthe observed number of relatively strong O VI absorbers.\nIt is not surprising that the models and observations do\nnot agree in detail because the physical processes that\nare relevant (e.g., metal transport) are very challenging to model, and approximate assumptions are required.\nBearing this in mind, the rough agreement between the\nmodels and the observations is encouraging.\n3.2. Doppler Parameter and Column Density\n\nDistributions\nAre the physical conditions implied by the O VI observations consistent with the expectations from the cosmological simulations? To address this question, we now\nexamine the implications of the detailed O VI line measurements. We begin by comparing the Doppler parameter and column density distributions of the intervening and proximate absorber components. Our motivation for this comparison is twofold: First, considering\nthe findings and issues noted in \u00a72.4.2, we would like to\nsearch for differences in the properties of intervening and\nproximate absorbers that might be useful for recognizing\nejected/intrinsic absorbers at high displacement velocities. Second, the proximate absorbers are highly likely\nto be photoionized. Some proximate systems show evidence that they are located close to the QSO central engine (see \u00a72.4.2) where photoionization by the intense UV\n\n\fNumber of O VI Components\n\n20\n\nTripp et al.\n\n20\nIntervening\nProximate\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nO VI b-value (km s-1)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFig. 13.- The distribution of O VI b\u2212values measured in individual components from Voigt-profile fitting (see Table 3). The\nthick lines show the measurements in intervening systems, and\nthe thin lines show the proximate absorber measurements (with\nvdispl < 5000 km s\u22121 ). Marginal measurements (those flagged\nwith a colon in Table 3) are excluded from this plot. The b\u2212value\nfor O VI at T = 3 \u00d7 105 K (where O VI peaks in abundance in\nCIE) is 18 km s\u22121 .\n\nemission from the QSO is likely to be dominant. Even\nif the proximate absorbers arise in an entirely different\ngalaxy from the QSO host, they are still likely to be predominantly photoionized by the QSO light because the\nStromgren spheres of luminous QSOs can extend over\nlarge distances/redshift intervals (e.g., Zheng & Davidsen 1995; Smette et al. 2002). Therefore proximate absorbers provide a valuable photoionized control sample\nfor understanding the ionization of the intervening systems.\nWe have noted in Table 3 that some of the individual component measurements are more uncertain due to\nsystematic problems such as strong blending and line saturation. We evaluate the effects of including or excluding these uncertain cases by defining two samples. Our\n\"robust\" sample excludes the uncertain cases that are\nflagged with a colon in Table 3, and the \"full\" sample uses\nall of the measurements (including the highly uncertain\ncases). Table 6 summarizes some basic measurements for\nthese samples including the median and mean values of\nthe O VI column densities and b\u2212values and the number of components in each sample. Inspecting Table 6,\nwe see that the mean and median O VI column densities\nof the intervening and proximate absorbers are similar,\nwith the intervening absorbers having somewhat lower\ncolumns on average. Comparing the b\u2212values, we notice\nthat the proximate systems tend to be somewhat narrower than then intervening cases. To statistically test\nwhether the intervening and proximate absorbers have\ndifferent N (O VI) and b distributions, we have applied\nKolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. Table 6 lists the results of our KS tests comparing the column density and\nb\u2212value distributions of the proximate and intervening\nsamples. Comparing the column-density distributions of\nthe robust intervening and proximate absorbers with a\nKS test, we find the KS statistic D = 0.171 and the probability of the null hypothesis (i.e., that the intervening\nand proximate absorbers are drawn from the same parent\n\ndistribution) is 55.8% . Therefore we find no compelling\nevidence that the intervening and proximate absorbers\nhave different column density distributions. If we use\nthe full sample instead of the robust sample, we reach\nthe same conclusion.\nWe have also used a KS test to compare the differential dN/dz distribution of the intervening and proximate\nO VI components shown in Figure 11. By comparing the\ndifferential dN/dz distributions instead of the straight\ncolumn-density distributions, we account for possible differences in the sensitivity of the spectra used to search\nfor intervening vs. proximate absorbers. By definition,\nproximate absorbers are located near the peak of the Ly\u03b2\n+ O VI emission line of the background QSO, and consequently, the proximate absorbers are found in regions\nwhere the flux is elevated and the S/N ratio is higher.\nThus, the proximate absorber regions can reveal weaker\nlines than the regions probed for intervening systems.\nHowever, a KS test applied to the differential dN/dz distributions shown in Figure 11 indicates a 49.7% probability that the samples are drawn from the same parent\ndistribution, so there is no statistically significant difference between the intervening and proximate absorbers.\nThe mean and median b\u2212values of the proximate absorbers are lower than those of the intervening lines.\nThe proximate and intervening absorber b\u2212value distributions are compared in Figure 13. Applying the KS test\nto the robust intervening and proximate b\u2212value distributions, we find that the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution is 3.6%\n. This weakly suggests that the intervening and proximate absorbers have different b\u2212value distributions, but\nthe result is only marginally significant. The full sample\nyields a KS probability of 5.3 %, i.e., a similar result.\nHowever, as we have discussed, the vdispl < 5000 km\ns\u22121 definition of the proximate absorbers may be somewhat arbitrary, and the truly intrinsic absorbers might\nbe mostly confined to a smaller velocity interval closer to\nzQSO . In Table 6, we show the mean and median statistics obtained by defining proximate absorbers to be those\ncases with vdispl < 2500 km s\u22121 . We see that this alternative definition only results in a slightly lower median\nand mean column densities and b\u2212values. However, the\nprobability that the intervening and proximate b\u2212values\nhave the same distribution decreases if we use the vdispl <\n2500 km s\u22121 definition: the probability of the null hypothesis decreases to 1.6 \u2212 2.7%. Thus, we find a somewhat stronger indication that the proximate absorbers\nare statistically more narrow than the intervening lines\nwith the hypothesis that proximate/intrinsic systems are\npredominantly confined to vdispl < 2500 km s\u22121 .\nIs there any direct evidence that the absorber distributions and properties change at some value of vdispl ? Or,\nis there evidence that a substantial fraction of the proximate/intrinsic absorbers are dispersed to large displacement velocities and are intermingled with the intervening systems as suggested by some of the papers noted in\n\u00a72.4.2? In Figure 14, we show the O VI column densities\nand b\u2212values of the intervening absorbers (filled circles)\nand the proximate systems (open squares) as a function\nof vdispl . While some intrinsic systems with high vdispl\nhave been reported in the literature (\u00a72.4.2), the majority\nof the known intrinsic systems are found relatively close\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n15.0\nlog [N(O VI) (cm-2)]\n\n14.5\n14.0\n13.5\n13.0\n12.5\n\nb-value (km s-1)\n\nIntervening\nProximate\n\n40\n20\n0\n12\n\n14.0\n13.5\n13.0\n12.5\n\n80\n60\n\n14.5\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nDisplacement Velocity (104 km s-1)\n\nFig. 14.- Upper panel: Individual-component O VI column densities as a function of velocity of displacement from the QSO redshift, vdispl = c[(1+zQSO )2 \u2212(1+zabs )2 ]/[(1+zQSO )2 +(1+zabs )2 ],\nfor intervening components (red filled circles) and proximate systems within 5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshift (blue open squares).\nLower panel: O VI b\u2212values vs. displacement velocity for intervening and proximate absorbers.\n\nto redshift of the QSO. Therefore, we might expect the\nabsorber properties to change as vdispl approaches zero\n(i.e., as zabs approaches zQSO ) if there are a significant\nnumber of intrinsic systems at vdispl < 5000 km s\u22121 . This\nwould be manifested as a correlation between N (O VI)\nor b(O VI) and vdispl . However, we have used Spearman\ntests to evaluate this hypothesis, and we find that there\nare no statistically significant correlations of any combination of the data shown in Figure 14. Considering\nonly the intervening absorbers, we find that N (O VI)\nand b(O VI) are not correlated with vdispl . Likewise, the\nproximate absorbers show no significant correlations. Finally, combining the intervening and proximate systems\ninto a single sample, we find no compelling correlations.\nOstensibly, Figure 14 does show an apparent increase\nin the simple number of intervening O VI lines at vdispl .\n6 \u00d7 104 km s\u22121 . However, this is not a real effect. Because of the combination of QSO redshifts and the observed wavelength range of the various spectra, some of\nthe sight lines probe larger ranges of vdispl than others.\nAll of the sight lines cover the vdispl \u2248 0 km s\u22121 region, but the upper bound on the observed vdispl range\nvaries significantly among the sight lines. Consequently,\nthe number of lines detected thins out as vdispl increases\nbecause fewer sight lines cover the larger vdispl values.\nWe do notice, however, that the distribution of proximate absorber velocities is sharply peaked around\nvdispl \u2248 0 km s\u22121 . This is a real effect since all of the sight\n\nNumber of Components\n\nlog [N(O VI) (cm-2)]\n\n15.0\n\n21\n\n15\n\nIntervening\nProximate\nIntervening\nProximate\n\n10\n5\n0\n1.0\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0 -0.2\nDisplacement Velocity (104 km s-1)\n\nFig. 15.- Upper panel: Invidual-component O VI column densities vs. displacement velocity (as in Figure 14 but expanded\nto more clearly show the absorbers within 10,000 km s\u22121 of the\nQSO redshift).

The thick line shows\nthe systems formally classified as intervening, and the thin line\nshows the proximate systems. A substantial excess of absorption\nlines is clearly evident within \u22481000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshifts.\n\nlines fully cover the \u22122000 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 5000 km s\u22121 range.\nTo show this more clearly, we show in the lower panel of\nFigure 15 the number of O VI lines found in 500 km s\u22121\nbins in the \u22122000 \u2264 vdispl \u2264 10000 km s\u22121 range; the\nthick-line histogram shows the intervening systems, and\nthe thin-line histogram represents the proximate cases\n(assuming the vdispl \u2264 5000 km s\u22121 definition). For reference, the upper panel of Figure 15 shows the column\ndensities of the individual components that contribute to\neach bin in the lower panel. We see that for vdispl & 1500\nkm s\u22121 , all of the bins, intervening or proximate, have\n0 \u2212 3 counts. At vdispl < 1500 km s\u22121 , however, the number of counts in each bin increases dramatically with 15\ncomponents in the bin centered at vdispl = 0 km s\u22121 and\n4 \u2212 6 counts in the other three bins. There is clearly a\nsubstantial excess of O VI lines at vdispl < 1500 km s\u22121 .\nThe excess is also evident in the contrasting dN/dz measurements listed in Tables 4 and 5. This excess is similar\nto the excess of C IV absorption lines at vdispl \u2248 0 km s\u22121\nobserved at higher redshifts (e.g., Foltz et al. 1986). Apparently, the standard vdispl value used to classify proximate absorbers (i.e., vdispl < 5000 km s\u22121 ) could be too\nlarge; the majority of the truly intrinsic absorbers appear\nto be located at smaller displacement velocities. There\nare known proximate systems at zabs < 0.4 with intrinsic absorption lines identified at vdispl \u226b 1500 km s\u22121\n(e.g., Yuan et al. 2002; Ganguly et al. 2003), but those\n\n\f22\n\nTripp et al.\n\nsystems have the characteristics of \"mini-BAL\" systems.\n15.0\n\n3.3. Correlation of N (O VI) with b(O VI)\n\n21 Most of the problematic measurements in the full intervening\nsample are below the log N (O VI) = 13.6 cutoff, so we obtain\nnearly identical results for the intervening systems using either the\nrobust or the full sample.\n\n14.5\nlog [N(O VI) (cm\u22122)]\n\nSome theoretical studies have predicted that N (O VI)\nand b(O VI) should be highly correlated. Using the basic ideas and formalism of Edgar & Chevalier (1986),\nHeckman et al. (2002) have argued that a correlation\nof N (O VI) and b(O VI) is a natural consequence of radiative cooling in a wide variety of contexts, and they\npresent a heterogeneous sample of O VI measurements\nthat are consistent with the expected N \u2212 b correlation.\nHeckman et al. (2002) include in their sample a small\nnumber of extragalactic O VI systems as well as measurements in the Milky Way ISM, the Magellanic Clouds, and\nstarburst galaxies. Subsequently, Lehner et al. (2006)\nand Danforth et al. (2006) revisited the Heckman et\nal. model with more homogeneous samples that only\nincluded extragalactic O VI systems, and they report\nmixed results. Danforth et al. (2006) report that they\nfind no correlation between N (O VI) and b(O VI). Conversely, Lehner et al. (2006) present a sample of measurements that are generally consistent with the Heckman\net al. models, but they note that the models predict\nNe VIII columns that are too large compared to their\nobservations.\nUsing our sample of component measurements from\nTable 3, Figure 16 plots log N (O VI) vs. b(O VI). As\nin previous sections, we show both the intervening and\nproximate systems (with vdispl < 5000 km s\u22121 ) with filled\ncircles and open squares, respectively. The dashed line\nin Figure 16 indicates the locus of N (O VI) and b(O VI)\nvalues for a single Gaussian line with a central optical\ndepth of 10% . Lines that are broad and have a low column density are difficult or impossible to detect because\nthe optical depth in individual pixels in their absorption\nprofiles are comparable to (or less than) the noise in the\ncontinuum. Moreover, such lines are difficult to distinguish from undulations in the intrinsic continuum of the\nQSO. Consequently, this N \u2212b locus is effectively a detection threshold; lines below the dashed line in Figure 16\nare usually undetectable. Neglect of this factor can produce an artificial correlation, as can be seen from Figure 16. We have used Spearman tests to evaluate whether\nN (O VI) and b(O VI) measurements from this paper are\ncorrelated. To account for the detection threshold, we\nonly use lines with log N (O VI) \u2265 13.6 in the Spearman test; from Figure 16, we can see that we can detect\nlines with log N (O VI) \u2265 13.6 over the full range of measured b\u2212values. From Spearman tests, we find that the\nproximate absorbers are not significantly correlated using either the robust sample or the full sample. On the\nother hand, the Spearman test indicates that in the case\nof the intervening absorbers, N (O VI) and b(O VI) are\ncorrelated at the 2.7\u03c3 level.21\nWhile the correlation in the intervening sample is suggestive, its significance is insufficient to provide compelling support for the Heckman et al. (2002) model.\nMoreover, comparing our measurements to the predictions from Heckman et al. (see their Figure 1), we see\n\n14.0\n\n13.5\n\n13.0\n\nIntervening\nProximate\n\n12.5\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nDoppler Parameter (km s\u22121)\n\n80\n\nFig. 16.- The O VI column density and b\u2212value combinations\nmeasured in individual components using Voigt-profile fitting (see\nTable 3). Filled red circles show measurements of the column densities and b\u2212values of components in intervening systems, and open\nblue squares show the proximate absorber measurements. This figure shows all measurements reported in Table 3, but the measurements that are marginal (due to problems such as line saturation)\nare plotted with smaller symbols. The dashed line shows the locus of b\u2212value - N (O VI) combinations for a Gaussian line with\na central optical depth of 10% ; this is an approximate detection\nthreshold for the data used in this paper.\n\nthat the scatter in the intervening absorbers is substantially larger than the scatter expected in the radiative\ncooling model. This may not be surprising because the\nintervening sample contains absorbers that are quite possibly photoionized (see \u00a74) and would not be expected\nto have correlated values of N and b. However, if we\nomit the absorbers that appear to be photoionized, the\nsignificance of the correlation remains marginal (< 3\u03c3).\nThe intervening absorber sample considered here has a\nnarrower range of b and N than the sample studied by\nHeckman et al. (2002). Their sample contained much\nlarger columns and velocity widths since it included measurements of O VI absorption in starburst outflows. The\ncorrelation between N and b is strongest in these types of\nenvironments, and recent results seem to confirm that the\ntrend at the higher end of the N \u2212 b distribution persists\n(T. M. Heckman 2008, private communication). In such\nenvironments, collisional processes dominate, and radiative cooling is an important, perhaps dominant, process in establishing line profile shapes. While the simple Heckman et al. (2002) model may not reflect the\nO VI intervening absorber population characteristics in\nall cases, it is likely that radiative cooling contributes in\npart to the observed distribution of N and b values.\n3.4. Profile Shapes: O VI vs. H I\n\nThe detailed correspondence (or lack thereof) between\nO VI and H I provides useful insight on the physical conditions and nature of the absorbers, so we now present\ncomparisons of the O VI and H I profile shapes. In \u00a72.4.1,\nwe noted that some of the O VI absorbers are characterized by kinematical simplicity with all the O VI and H I\ncomponent velocity centroids aligned to within their 2\u03c3\nuncertainties (\u00a72.3.2), but other systems are more complex with velocity offsets between the nearest O VI and\nH I components that can exceed 50 km s\u22121 (see Figure 6).\nWhen the H I and O VI centroids in a component are\n\n\fNormalized Apparent Column Density\n\nIGM O VI Statistics\n\n1.2\n1.0\n\nb = 4 km s-1\n(marginally resolved)\n\nT = 3.0 x 105 K\nO VI\nHI\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n100\nVelocity (km s-1)\n\n200\n\nFig. 17.- Theoretical apparent column density profiles observed\nat the resolution of the STIS E140M echelle spectrograph (based on\nthe E140M line-spread functions from the STIS Handbook for the\n0.\u2032\u2032 060.\u2032\u2032 2 slit). All of the profiles are normalized so that the peak of\nthe profile = 1.0. The dashed line shows the profile of a marginally\nresolved line with b = 4 km s\u22121 . The solid line shows the predicted\nprofile for an O VI line broadened only by thermal motions and\narising in gas at T = 3.0 \u00d7 105 K, and the dotted line shows the\ncorresponding H I profile, i.e., an H I line that is only broadened\nby thermal motions at T = 3.0 \u00d7 105 K. At this temperature, O VI\nand H I lines are well-resolved with the E140M spectrograph and\nare expected to have dramatically different Na (v) profiles if they\nare predominantly thermally broadened.\n\nwell-aligned, the component can be modeled as a singlephase gas cloud (conversely, significant velocity offsets\npreclude single-phase models). Additional information\nsuch as the low-ion profiles presented in \u00a72.4.1 and Figure 3 (for the PKS0312-770 system at zabs = 0.20266)\ncan also establish that an absorber is a multiphase entity, and when available, we have used information on low\nions to evaluate whether a system is truly a multiphase\nabsorber.\nAs noted in \u00a72.4, we classify 37% of the intervening\nabsorbers as simple systems with all of their O VI and\nH I components aligned to within the measurement uncertainties. We can go beyond rough classifications and\ngain better insight by directly examining the O VI and\nH I profiles. To do this, we employ apparent column\ndensity [Na (v)] profiles as described in \u00a72.3. Na (v) profiles have a significant advantage for comparing different\nspecies: Na (v) profiles are linear functions, and they can\nbe simply scaled to compare the detailed correspondence\nof two species. When good detections of multiple transitions are available for a given species (e.g., the 1031.93\nand 1037.62 \u00c5 lines or multiple H I Lyman series lines),\nwe use the method of Jenkins & Peimbert (1997) to construct composite Na (v) profiles. These composite profiles\nhave better S/N ratios. More importantly, weak lines can\nbe used to constrain the Na (v) profile in high-column\ndensity regions where the strong lines are saturated, and\nconversely, strong lines can be employed to flesh out the\nprofile in the low-density regions where the weak lines\nare undetectable.\nTo guide the interpretation of the Na (v) profiles, we\nshow in Figure 17 several theoretical Na (v) profiles constructed using the STIS E140M line-spread function (using the LSF for the 0.\u2032\u2032 06 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 2 slit). The E140M mode\nhas excellent spectral resolution, and consequently, relatively narrow lines are resolved with this spectrograph.\n\n23\n\nThe dashed line in Figure 17 shows a marginally resolved,\nhypothetical line with b = 4 km s\u22121 ; the solid line shows\na thermally broadened O VI profile at T = 3.0 \u00d7 105\nK [i.e., close to the temperature where O VI peaks in\nabundance in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE)].\nWe can see that at this gas temperature, an O VI line is\nwell-resolved, and the apparent column density profile is\ntherefore a close approximation of the the true column\ndensity profile. The dotted line in Figure 17 shows the\nNa (v) profile of a thermally broadened H I line, also at\nT = 3.0 \u00d7 105 K, normalized to have the same peak value\nas the O VI line. Comparison of the O VI and H I profiles in Figure 17 makes an important point: because its\nmass is 16 times smaller, H I profiles should be four times\nbroader than O VI lines arising in the same gas if the lines\nare predominantly thermally broadened. At the resolution provided by our STIS data, detection of this effect\nis, in principle, trivial at the temperatures expected for\nthe WHIM gas. As we shall see, H I profiles that are significantly broader than the corresponding O VI profiles\n(like those shown in Figure 17) are relatively rare in the\nreal data of our sample. We note that the sensitivity of\nour STIS data is sufficient to detect H I with good significance at the temperatures where O VI peaks in CIE\n(see, e.g., Richter et al. 2006a,b). However, there are\nsome important caveats. As we will show in \u00a74.2.1, if the\ntemperature range is tuned to maximize the O VI/H I ratio or the absorber metallicity is intrinsically high, then a\nbroad H I component corresponding with hot O VI could\nbe quite difficult to detect. Also, in complex multicomponent systems, broad Ly\u03b1 components are often easily\nhidden (\u00a74.2).\nThe observed Na (v) profiles derived from the O VI and\nH I lines for all of the absorbers (intervening and proximate) are shown in Figure 18. The profiles are ordered\nalphabetically by sight line name and presented sequentially by redshift for a given sight line. Following the\nsight line name, the codes \"I\" and \"P\" indicate whether\nthe absorber is an intervening or proximate system, and\n\"S\" and \"C\" represent the simple and complex classifications. The black histograms show the O VI profiles\nand the large-dot histograms represent the H I profiles.\nThe H I profiles have been scaled to show their correspondence with the O VI data, and the H I scale factor\nis indicated in each panel of Figure 18. In some cases, a\nsecond scaling of the H I profile is shown with small-dot\nhistograms.\nInspection of Figure 18 reveals an interesting result:\nvery few of these absorption systems clearly have H I\nlines that are four times broader than the corresponding\nO VI lines. The H I lines are broader than the O VI\nlines, as expected if the lines arise in the same gas, but\nthey are not four times broader. This indicates that the\nabsorbers are not predominantly thermally broadened;\nnonthermally broadening is apparently important. Moreover, many of the H I lines in these cases are narrower\nthan expected in WHIM plasma. As we will show in\n\u00a74.1.1, these well-aligned H I and O VI components frequently indicate that T \u226a 105 K if the lines originate\nin the same plasma. As noted above, 37% of the intervening O VI absorbers have O VI and H I profiles that\nare well-aligned in velocity and are classified as singlephase systems. However, from Figure 18 we see that\neven in the complex absorbers there are velocity ranges\n\n\f24\n\nTripp et al.\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n1.5\n1.0\n\nx\n\n3C 249.1 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.24676\n\n1.5\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.25)\n\n1.0\n\n3C 249.1 (P-C)\nzabs = 0.30811\n\n3C 249.1 (P-S)\nzabs = 0.31364\n\nO VI\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nH I (x6.00)\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.30)\n\n3C 273.0 (I-C)\nzabs = 0.00334\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.17)\n\n3C 273.0 (I-C)\nzabs = 0.09022\n\nO VI\nH I (x1.00)\n\n3C 273.0 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.12003\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.90)\n\n3C 273.0 (P), zabs = 0.15779\nx\n\nO VI\nH I (x5.00)\n\nx\n\n3C 351.0 (I-C)\n\nO VI\n\nzabs = 0.21811\n\nH I (x2.00)\n\n3C 351.0 (I-C)\nzabs = 0.22111\n\n3C 351.0 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.31658\n\n1.5\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.60)\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.4)\n\n0.5\n0.0\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2.0\n\nH1821+643 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.02438\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.0\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n1\n0\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.8\n\nO VI\nH I (x1.00)\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.20)\n\n1.5\n\nH1821+643 (I-C)\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.15)\n\nzabs = 0.22496\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.04)\n\nH1821+643 (I-C)\n\nO VI\n\nzabs = 0.22638\n\nH I (x2.0)\n\nH1821+643 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.24531\n\nO VI\nH I (x4.0)\n\nH1821+643 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.26656\n\nH1821+643 (P-C)\nzabs = 0.29666\n\nO VI\nH I (x1.60)\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.13)\n\nHE0226-4110 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.01747\n\nO VI\nH I (x3.0)\n\nHE0226-4110 (I-C)\n\nO VI\n\nzabs = 0.20701\n\nH I (x0.20)\n\nHE0226-4110 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.34035\n\nHE0226-4110 (I-S)\nzabs = 0.35525\n\n1.0\n\nx\n\n-200\n\nH1821+643 (I-C)\nzabs = 0.21331\n\n0.4\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\n3\n\nzabs = 0.12143\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n0.0\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nH1821+643 (I-C)\n\nO VI\nH I (x3.0)\n\nO VI\nH I (x0.9)\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-100\n0\n100\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n200\n\n-200\n\n-100\n0\n100\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n200\n\nFig. 18.- Comparison of the O VI apparent column density profiles (black histograms) to the affiliated H I Na (v) profiles (red-dot\nhistograms) for all O VI absorbers reported in this paper. Each panel is labeled with the QSO sight line and the redshift of the system\nshown in that panel. Codes in parentheses denote whether the system is intervening (I) or proximate (P) and whether it is classified as\nsimple (S) or complex (C). The H I profiles have been scaled as indicated in each panel for comparison with the O VI profile (the H I scale\nfactors are not based on fits; these are just convenient scalings for purposes of comparison); in some cases a different scaling is shown with\na small black-dot histogram. Whenever possible, the profiles are weighted composite profiles derived from multiple transitions using the\nmethod of Jenkins & Peimbert (1997). By constructing composite profiles, weaker lines can be used to determine Na (v) in the line cores\nwhere the strong lines are saturated.

Intervening systems are\nshown with filled circles and proximate absorbers are plotted with\nopen squares with 1\u03c3 error bars. For several proximate absorbers,\nH I is not detected, and the plotted point marks the 3\u03c3 upper\nlimit on N (H I). In two cases, the O VI is saturated, and N (O VI)\nis indicated as a lower limit. Lower panel: The log [H I/O VI]\ncolumn density ratio vs. log N (H I) for the aligned components\nshown in the upper panel. The solid line shows the relation between\nN (H I)/N (O VI) and N (O VI) if N (O VI) is a constant equal to\nthe median of the robust intervening sample (see Table 6). The\nsolid line is plotted for illustration (see text) and is not a fit to the\ndata. The dash-dot line shows the O VI detection threshold. In\nthe lower panel, points in the upper-left region would have O VI\ncolumn densities below our detection threshold, and points in the\nlower right would require high metallicities. Thus, the correlation\nof H I/O VI with N (H I) can be largely due to selection effects.\n\nwhere the O VI and H I profiles are well-aligned. The\ngood velocity alignment of the O VI and H I profiles\ndoes not preclude warm-hot gas; this only indicates that\nnon-thermal broadening is important. However, as we\nwill show in \u00a74.1.1, the implied temperatures tend to be\nless than 105 K. Warm-hot gas is still possible in some of\nthese cases (\u00a74.2.1), but this requires that the warm-hot\nO VI is usually found in close proximity to cooler, lowionization gas. We shall consider these issues in detail in\n\u00a74.\n3.5. H I/O VI Column Density Ratios\n\nFinally, we consider the statistics of N (O VI) vs.\nN (H I) and the H I/O VI column density ratios in our\nO VI samples. These statistics can, in principle, provide\ninsight about the physical conditions of the absorbers.\nHowever, because these absorbers can have a multiphase\nnature with contributions to N (H I) from low-ionization\ngas as well as high-ionization phases (see, e.g., \u00a72.4.2;\nChen & Prochaska 2000; Tripp et al. 2000; Richter et al.\n\n27\n\n2004; Sembach et al. 2004; Tumlinson et al. 2005; Savage et al. 2005), the H I/O VI ratio should be interpreted\ncarefully. The H I in the PKS0312-770 absorber shown\nin Figures 2 and 3, for example, must include a substantial contribution from the low-ionization gas, and it is\nnot at all clear how much of the H I is affiliated with the\nO VI-bearing gas. Comparison of the total H I and O VI\ncolumn densities can introduce systematic errors because\nthis can mix in some H I gas that is known to be unrelated to the O VI into the measurements. To overcome\nthis problem, we strive to identify cases where the data\nindicate that the H I and O VI absorption lines are more\nlikely to arise in the same gas. To achieve this, we focus\nin this section on the components which have well-aligned\nO VI and H I absorption components. As discussed in\nthe previous section, Figure 18 shows that many of the\nO VI and H I profiles are well-aligned. This similarity is\nnot necessarily expected in multiphase entities; different\ntemperatures, turbulence, and/or bulk kinematics in the\ndifferent phases would likely lead to detailed differences\nin the profiles in the low-ionization and high-ionization\nphases. The remarkable alignment of some of the components strongly suggests that in these cases, the O VI\nand H I are strongly mixed in a single gas phase, hence\nwe concentrate on these aligned cases in this section. We\nnote that there are other components with clear velocity offsets between the O VI and H I (see Figure 6); we\ndiscuss these more complicated cases in \u00a74.2.\nFrom our robust samples of intervening and proximate\nabsorbers, we have selected all components whose O VI\nand H I velocity centroids are aligned to within their 2\u03c3\nvelocity-difference uncertainties. We employ these \"wellmatched\" O VI + H I components for several purposes\nin the rest of this paper, and various measurements for\nthe well-matched cases are plotted in Figures 19 - 32.\nSeveral useful properties of the well-aligned intervening\ncomponents are listed in Table 7 including constraints on\nthe plasma temperature and nonthermal broadening of\nthe lines (see \u00a74.1.1), measured H I/O VI and C III/O VI\ncolumn-density ratios (including upper limits), and the\nclassification (simple vs. complex) of the absorption system in which the particular component is found.22\nWe show N (O VI) vs. N (H I) for the well-matched, robust sample in the upper frame of Figure 19. Applying\na Spearman test to the intervening sample in Figure 19,\nwe find that the probability of the null hypothesis (i.e.,\nno correlation) is 2.7% . Thus, we find a weak indication\nthat N (O VI) and N (H I) are correlated in the intervening absorbers. Interpretation of the proximate system\ndata is complicated by the fact that H I is not detected\nat all in several proximate absorbers (see Figure 7), but\nSpearman tests nevertheless indicate that there is no significant evidence for any correlation of any combination\nof the proximate system H I and O VI column densities\nshown in the upper panel of Figure 19.\nIn the lower panel of Figure 19 we show the correlation\nbetween log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] and log N (H I) for the\nrobust well-matched sample. Danforth & Shull (2005)\nhave argued that this correlation is an important indi22 As can be seen from Table 3, there are well-aligned components located within complex, multicomponent absorbers that also\nshow clear offsets in other components; we include these aligned\ncomponents in this section and in Table 7, but we note that they\nare drawn from complex absorbers in column 11 of Table 7.\n\n\f28\n\nTripp et al.\n\nlog [N(H I)/N(O VI)]\n\n2\n1\n\u2193\n\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n12\n\nIntervening\nProximate\n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\u2193\u2193\n\u2193\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nDisplacement Velocity (104 km s\u22121)\n\nFig. 20.- The H I/O VI ratio vs. velocity of displacement from\nthe QSO redshift.

We find from a Spearman test applied to the\nwell-aligned sample in Figure 19 that the H I/O VI ratio\nis indeed highly correlated with H I, and we find that\nthe slope in Figure 19 is fully consistent with the slope\nreported by Danforth & Shull (2005). However, this correlation is automatic at some level since H I/O VI is\nbeing correlated with N (H I). The solid line in Figure 19\nshows the correlation that would result from a sample\nwith a single (constant) O VI column density equal to\nthe median N (O VI) that we measure from our robust\nintervening sample. The correlation in the lower panel\nof Figure 19 simply shows that N (O VI) is not strongly\ncorrelated with N (H I). Danforth & Shull (2005) argue\nthat N (O VI) should be directly proportional to N (H I)\nif the gas is photoionized. While N (O VI) and N (H I)\nmight be weakly correlated, Figure 19 clearly shows that\nN (O VI) is not linearly proportional to N (H I); there is\nsubstantial scatter in the data. However, the amount of\nO VI in an H I cloud depends on both the metallicity\nand the physical conditions of the gas, and it is not clear\nthat N (O VI) should be strictly proportional to N (H I)\nin photoionized gas. We will return to this issue in \u00a74.1.3,\nand we will show that the correlation in the lower panel\nof Figure 19 can arise naturally in photoionized gas.\nAlso, there are some important selection effects that\nshould be borne in mind when analyzing the lower panel\nof Figure 19. First, if the O VI column density is too\nlow, the line will be lost in the noise. In our sample, we\ndetect very few lines with log N (O VI) <13.1 (see Figure 16), and we take this as our O VI detection threshold. The dash-dot line in Figure 19 shows this detection\nthreshold. We can see that this threshold explains the\nabsence of points in the upper-left region of the lower\npanel of Figure 19; absorbers in that region would have\nundetectable O VI lines.23 We can detect absorbers that\n23\n\nAs we have shown in previous papers (e.g., Savage et al. 2002;\n\nwould populate the lower-right region of that plot, but\nany ionization mechanism would require a high metallicity to place points in that region. The lack of points in\nthe lower right likely indicates that the O VI absorbers\ndo not have such high metallicities.\nWe noted in \u00a72.4.2 that there is a notable difference between the intervening and proximate absorbers: some of\nthe proximate systems show no detectable, affiliated H I.\nFigure 19 shows that the majority of these H I-deficient\nproximate systems are located in a part of the N (O VI) N (H I) parameter space where no intervening absorbers\nare found. More measurements of proximate absorbers\nare needed to determine if low H I/O VI ratios are a distinguishing signature of intrinsic absorbers, but the lack\nof analogous low H I/O VI components in the intervening absorbers suggests that there is very little contamination of the intervening sample with intrinsic absorbers\nthat have been accelerated to high ejection velocities.\nFigure 20 shows the H I/O VI ratio of the matched intervening and proximate absorbers as a function of displacement velocity. We see that roughly one third of the\nof proximate systems have log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] < \u22121.\nIf, for example, up to a third of the intervening systems\nare high-velocity ejected systems (as suggested by some\npapers, see \u00a72.4.2), and one third of those ejected cases\nhave log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] < \u22121, then we would expect\nto find 4\u22125 absorbers in the intervening sample with similarly low H I/O VI ratios. This number of low H I/O VI\nsystems is clearly not present in the matched intervening\nsample (see Figure 20). It remains possible that some of\nthe intervening systems that are classified as multiphase\nabsorbers because of substantial differences between the\nH I and O VI profile shapes are the high-velocity ejected\nsystems, but at this juncture, we do not find any clear\nevidence that ejected, intrinsic absorbers are a significant\nsource of contamination of the intervening O VI sample\ndefined by vdispl > 5000 km s\u22121 .\n4. PHYSICAL CONDITIONS\n\nNext we consider the physical conditions implied by\nour O VI and H I measurements. We first derive quantitative constraints on the gas temperatures in the components with well-matched O VI and H I components\n(\u00a74.1.1), and then we discuss the implications of the\nwell-aligned absorber properties regarding the process by\nwhich the gas is ionized (\u00a7\u00a74.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4). We will\nfind that the simplest models favor an origin in cool, photoionized gas for a substantial fraction of the absorbers.\nHowever, in \u00a74.2 we point out some of the complexities\nencountered in multiphase systems and the implications\nregarding hot gas in such absorbers, and we examine\nwhether the broad Ly\u03b1 components associated with hot\nO VI could be hidden in the noise (\u00a74.2.1). In this section, we will focus primarily on the intervening absorbers,\nwhich are more pertinent to the primary goals of our survey, and we exclude the more uncertain measurements\nthat are flagged with a colon in Table 3.\nRichter et al. 2004; Sembach et al. 2004; Tripp et al. 2005;\nAracil et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2006, 2007), there are many Ly\u03b1\nabsorbers,including relatively high\u2212N (H I) systems, that show no\ncorresponding O VI absorption. Therefore, it is highly possible that\nsystems that populate the upper-left portion of the lower panel of\nFigure 19 exist but have not yet been identified due to the limited\nS/N of the currently available data.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n4.1. O VI Systems with Well-Aligned H I Components\n4.1.1. Temperature Constraints\n\nThe line width of an individual absorption component\nprovides a fundamental constraint on the temperature\nof the absorbing gas. If the line width is dominated by\nthermal motions, then the b\u2212value is directly related to\nthe gas temperature T and the mass m of the species,\n\u00132\n\u0012\nb\nmb2\n,\n(7)\n=A\nT =\n2k\n0.129\nwhere A is the atomic mass number and the numerical\ncoefficient assumes that b is in km s\u22121 and T is in K. In\nmany situations, however, other factors will contribute\nto the line broadening such as turbulence or multiple unresolved components. If other factors are likely to contribute to the line broadening, then equation 7 can still\nprovide a useful upper limit on T . However, if absorption\nlines from two or more species with significantly different masses are available (and are believed to arise in the\nsame gas), then b can be expresssed as a combination of\na thermal broadening term and a nonthermal broadening\nterm bnt ,\nT\nb2 = (0.129)2 + b2nt ,\n(8)\nA\nwhich can be solved for T and bnt , assuming the nonthermal motions are adequately characterized by a Gaussian profile. This equation can provide valuable insights\nabout the nature of the absorbers.\nOne of the main goals of this survey is to search for\nevidence of the shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic gas\nin order to understand the inventory of baryons in the\nuniverse (\u00a71). In most theoretical studies, the WHIM is\ndefined to have T \u2265 105 K (but see Kang et al. 2005 for\nevidence that a substantial portion of the WHIM could\nbe cooler). For O VI, T \u2265 105 K implies that b(O VI) \u2265\n10 km s\u22121 . From Table 3 and Figure 16, we see that the\nmajority of the intervening O VI absorption lines have\nsufficiently large b\u2212values to be consistent with a WHIM\norigin. This is a necessary but insufficient requirement\nto establish that these absorbers originate in the WHIM,\nhowever, because if bnt is substantial, T \u226a 105 remains\npossible. Much more stringent constraints can be derived\nfrom H I, which has b(H I) \u2265 41 km s\u22121 if T \u2265 105 K.\nTherefore, we next consider the temperatures implied\nby the well-matched sample of H I and O VI components\nthat are well-aligned in velocity.24 The good correspondence of many of the aligned O VI and H I profiles (see\nFigs. 4 and 18) suggests that these O VI and H I lines\narise in the same gas, and therefore we can employ the\ntwo versions of equation 8 for H I and O VI to solve\nfor T and bnt . Using the O VI and H I b\u2212values for the\naligned components and equations 7 and 8, we obtain the\ngas temperature constraints listed in Table 7. Columns\n4 and 5 in Table 7 list the constraints implied from the\nO VI b\u2212values only (eqn.7); column 4 gives the temperature implied by the best value of b(O VI) and column\n5 lists the 3\u03c3 upper limit implied by the uncertainties\n24 In principle, this technique can be applied to other combinations such as C III and O VI. However, these combinations usually\nare not particularly useful because of the similar masses of elements\nlike C and O combined with the measurement uncertainties in the\nb\u2212values.\n\n29\n\nin b(O VI). We treat these temperature constraints as\nupper limits because nonthermal broadening could be a\nsignificant source of line broadening. Columns 6 and 7\nlist the temperatures found by solving equation 8 with\nb(H I) and b(O VI); column 6 reports the best temperature and column 7 provides the 3\u03c3 upper limit found\nby propagating the b\u2212value uncertainties through equation 8.\nFrom equation 8, we see that at a constant temperature, the relationship between b(H I)2 and b(O VI)2 is\na straight line with unity slope. Therefore, by plotting\nb(H I)2 vs. b(O VI)2 , we can visually show where an\nH I + O VI absorber is located in (T, bnt ) space. We\nshow this visual representation of the b\u2212values of the\nwell-aligned absorbers in Figure 21. The advantage of\nthis presentation is that the combinations of T and bnt\ncan be quickly assessed by inspection. In addition, Figure 21 shows whether the lines are predominantly thermally broadened (or not) and whether the assertion that\nthe H I and O VI are mixed together is physically reasonable. There are two physical limits on allowed b(H I),\nb(O VI) combinations if the H I and O VI are mixed\ntogether. The dash-dot line shows the physical limit\nof b(H I) = b(O VI); b(H I) < b(O VI) is unphysical\nbut can arise from noise in the b\u2212value measurements if\nthe lines are mainly broadened by nonthermal motions\nand/or have large b\u2212value uncertainties. The dotted line\nindicates the other physical limit, b(H I) = 4b(O VI),\nwhich occurs if the lines are entirely thermally broadened. The solid lines are loci of constant temperature\nwith log T = 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5 (from bottom to top,\nrespectively). On each constant\u2212T locus, the tick marks\nindicate values of bnt starting from bnt = 0 km s\u22121 and\nincreasing in increments of 10 km s\u22121 from left to right\n(the bnt = 20, 40, and 60 km s\u22121 ticks are labeled).\nSeveral aspects of Figure 21 deserve comment. First,\nmost of the well-aligned intervening components are not\npredominantly thermally broadened. Relatively few of\nthe measurements are close to the b(H I) = 4b(O VI)\ndotted-line locus expected for predominantly thermally\nbroadened absorbers. Second, many of the points indicate temperatures well below the canonical 105 K lower\nlimit for WHIM plasma (see further comments below).\nThird, some points fall outside of the physically allowed\nregions. While some of these apparently unphysical combinations could be artifacts due to noise, we note that\nmany of these cases have complex multicomponent structure, and this can lead to ambiguity in the assignment\nof O VI components with H I components. It remains\npossible that broad H I components are present in these\nabsorbers, and the O VI has been inadvertently aligned\nwith a narrow H I line that happens to have a similar\nvelocity. We discuss this possibility in \u00a74.2. In most of\nthe aligned absorption lines, the H I \u2212 O VI matching\nis clear and unambiguous (see examples shown in Figure 4), but a broad H I component could still be hidden\nin the noise (see \u00a74.2.1).\nNevertheless, the simplest model is to assume that if\nthe H I and O VI line centroids are well-aligned and the\nprofiles have similar shapes, then the H I and O VI absorption lines arise in the same (single-phase) gas cloud.\nWe adopt this assumption for the rest of this section.

The measured points are shown by open squares\nwith 1\u03c3 error bars. For most of these aligned components, b(H I) > b(O VI), as expected if the H I and O VI are mixed together and arise\nin the same gas phase [the dash-dot line indicates the b(H I) = b(O VI) line of equality]. The dotted line shows the b(H I) = 4b(O VI) locus;\nthis is the relation for purely thermally broadened lines and represents the other boundary of physically possible measurements. Some of\nthe cases that are outside of the physically-allowed region can be attributed to measurement errors, but we show in \u00a74.2 that some of these\ncases could be due to multiphase media in which the O VI is close in velocity to narrow and broad H I components, and our algorithm\nhas incorrectly assigned the O VI to the narrow H I line. The solid lines show loci of constant-temperature for log T = 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and\n5.5 (from bottom to top, respectively), and the tick marks on each solid line indicate the values of bnt that produce the b(H I), b(O VI)\ncombination at the given temperature.

From these figures,\nwe see that the quantitative results derived in this section corroborate the qualitative conclusion reached from\ncomparison of the O VI and H I profiles in \u00a73.4: a large\nfraction of the well-matched components appear to be too\ncold to arise in WHIM gas (with the standard T > 105 K\nWHIM definition). Sixty-two percent of the Tbest values\nin column 6 of Table 7 are below 105 K.

As in Figure 23, all of the aligned\ncomponents from intervening systems are shown with an open histogram. The hatched histogram represents components from complex/multiphase systems only.\n\nwith collisional ionization at the standard temperatures\nwhere O VI is found in CIE, and most of these aligned\ncomponents are not consistent with the standard temperatures expected for WHIM gas. It is possible that most\nof the WHIM gas is located in the multiphase absorbers\n(as we discuss below), but in the simple absorbers we\nfind strong evidence that a substantial fraction of these\nsystems are either photoionized or arise in collisionally\nionized gas that is out of equilibrium.\nIt is interesting to examine the temperatures in Figures 22 and 23 more closely. While most of aligned\ncomponents imply temperatures lower than log T = 5.5,\nten of the aligned components (26% ) in Table 7 imply log T \u2265 4.6, which is warmer than the temperatures\nexpected in standard photoionization models (see, e.g.,\nthe photoionization models reported in Sembach et al.\n2004 and Lehner et al. 2006). These moderately warm\nsystems could arise in shock-heated gas that has cooled\nmore rapidly than it can recombine and thus is in an\noverionized, moderately warm condition. It is also interesting to note that aligned components that are found\nwithin multiphase systems (indicated with hatching in\nFigures 23 and 24) tend to indicate higher temperatures\nand greater amounts of nonthermal broadening. Multiphase absorption could be more likely to occur in gas\naccreting into deeper potential wells because such locations are likely sites for shock heating but could also be\nplaces where more gas cools quickly due to processes such\nas thermal instability (e.g., Maller & Bullock 2004). Motivated by this possibility, we consider whether available\nnon-equilibrium collisional ionization models agree with\nthese observations in the next section (\u00a74.1.2)\nWe have commented above on the fractions of the\naligned components that are relatively cool. While we\nhave not placed constraints on the temperatures of the\nnon-aligned O VI components (i.e., those with significant\nvelocity offsets between O VI and H I), we can nevertheless place a lower limit on the fraction of the O VI components that are relatively cold. There are 70 components\nin the robust intervening sample. From Table 7, we see\nthat there are 24 components with log Tbest < 5.0 in the\nsimplest model. This indicates that at least 34% of the\n\n\f32\n\nTripp et al.\n\nintervening components are cooler than the standard 105\nK WHIM cutoff. Conversely, at least 14% of the robust\nsample of intervening components has log Tbest > 4.6\n(hotter than expected in typical photoionization models).\n4.1.2. Collisional Ionization Models\n\nWe have presented strong evidence that many of the\nlow\u2212z O VI lines arise in cool gas. For many of the O VI\ncomponents, the temperature constraints in Table 7 preclude a WHIM origin at the collisional ionization equilibrium temperatures where O VI is expected to peak in\nabundance (e.g., Sutherland & Dopita 1993). But could\nthe absorption lines arise in collisionally ionized gas that\nis out of equilibrium?\nIn the context of the Milky Way ISM, the possibility\nthat high ions could be detectable in non-equilibrium,\noverionized gas has long been considered (e.g., Kafatos\n1973; Shapiro & Moore 1976; Edgar & Chevalier 1986;\nIndebetouw & Shull 2004; Gnat & Sternberg 2007). If\nshock-heated, highly ionized gas can cool more rapidly\nthan it recombines, then species like O VI might be\nfound in surprisingly cool material. ISM densities are\nsubstantially higher than IGM densities though, and in\nthe context of the IGM, it is sometimes argued that\nthis scenario is unlikely because the cooling timescale,\n\u03c4cool = 3kT /2n\u039b(T ), is quite long when the cooling function \u039b(T ) for low-metallicity material (e.g., Sutherland &\nDopita 1993; Gnat & Sternberg 2007) is combined with\nthe theoretically expected low densities of IGM gas. If\nwe use the parameters typically adopted for \u03c4cool calculations (e.g., the gas is initially heated to T > 106 K,\nn < 10\u22125 cm\u22123 , Z < 0.1Z\u2299 ), we do find that it will not\ncool in a Hubble time (e.g., Dopita & Sutherland 2003;\nShull et al. 2003). However, there are several factors that\ncould make \u03c4cool shorter: First, in low\u2212z IGM clouds\nwhere several metals are detected, studies have indicated\nmetallicities significantly greater than 0.1 Z\u2299 (e.g., Savage et al. 2002; Jenkins et al. 2005; Tumlinson et al.\n2005; Aracil et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2006). Higher\nmetallicity increases \u039b(T ) (see Figure 4 in Gnat & Sternberg 2007) and thus decreases \u03c4cool . On the other hand,\nsimilar studies of low\u2212z systems with well-constrained\nmetallicities have indicated Z < 0.1Z\u2299 (e.g., Tripp et al.\n2002,2005). There appears to be a very large range in\nthe metallicity of the low\u2212 IGM, and it is not clear what\nmetallicity should be assumed for a random IGM cloud,\nbut it has been shown that some clouds are significantly\nenriched and therefore could cool more quickly. Second,\nif the WHIM is heated by lower-velocity shocks, the initial temperature might be lower than usually assumed,\nwhich increases \u039b(T ). If the initial temperature is only\n105.5 K, for example, the gas will cool more rapidly (see\nFigure 4 in Gnat & Sternberg). Thirdly, the gas densities could be somewhat higher than 10\u22125 cm\u22123 . For the\nwell-aligned sample, log N (H I) ranges from \u2248 13.3 to\n14.5 (see Figure 19). The H I number density n(H I) =\n3.2 \u00d7 10\u221225 N (H I)/L, where L is the size of the cloud\nin Mpc. At log T = 5.5, the H I ion fraction is 10\u22125.9\n(Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Gnat & Sternberg 2007), so\nif L = 100 kpc and T = 105.5 K, the total H density in\nthe well-aligned absorbers ranges from \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123\nto \u2248 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 . The combination of higher densities, higher metallicities, and lower initial temperatures\n\nFig. 25.- Comparison of nonequilibrium ion fractions in isochoric radiatively cooling gas for O VI (thick solid lines), C IV\n(dashed lines), and C III (thin solid lines) calculated by Gnat &\nSternberg (2007) for logarithmic metallicities of [M/H] = 0 (blue\ncurves), [M/H] = \u22121 (black curves), and [M/H] = \u22122 (green\ncurves). The collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) ion fractions\nare also shown with red lines.\n\nthan usually assumed can lead to cooling times that are\nsignificantly shorter than the Hubble time.\nThe timescale to approach ionization equilibrium is ap\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n+ \u03c4rec\n] , where \u03c4rec is the\nproximately \u03c4ioneq = [\u03c4ion\nrecombination time scale and the \u03c4ion is the ionization\ntimescale. Considering estimates of \u03c4ion and \u03c4rec for\nO VI, O VII, and O VIII at WHIM temperatures and\ndensities (see, e.g., Figure 3 in Yoshikawa & Sasaki 2006),\nwe see that \u03c4ioneq \u226a \u03c4Hubble , and for many combinations\nof IGM physical conditions, \u03c4ioneq < \u03c4cool . Therefore\nCIE could be a good approximation for O VI, O VII, and\nO VIII in WHIM absorbers.\nSince these absorbers could be cooling rapidly, we will\nnow consider whether the observed properties of the O VI\nsystems could be consistent with predictions from radiatively cooling, overionized gas models. For this purpose,\nwe list in columns 9 and 10 of Table 7 two observables\nthat can be readily compared to nonequilibrium model\npredictions: the N (H I)/N (O VI) and N (C III)/N (O VI)\ncolumn density ratios measured in the well-matched components of intervening absorbers. In many of our systems, C III is not detected, so we provide 3\u03c3 limits based\non the measured upper limit on the C III rest-frame\nequivalent width assuming the linear portion of the curve\nof growth applies. In some cases, C III is detected but is\nstrong enough so that it could be underestimated due to\nsaturation (see, e.g., Savage et al. 2002); in these cases\nwe treat the measured N (C III) as a lower limit.\nGnat & Sternberg (2007) have recently modeled\nnonequilibrium radiatively cooling gas, and they provide\npredictions for these column density ratios as a function\nof gas temperature. They have modeled both isochoric\nand isobaric cooling gas, and they provide predictions\nfor models with a wide range of metallicities. In Figure 25, we compare the ion fractions of C III, C IV,\nand O VI predicted by Gnat & Sternberg (2007), for\nisochoric radiatively cooling gas, to the ion fractions for\nthese species from CIE. This figure demonstrates several\nimportant aspects of nonequilibrium radiatively cooling\nmodels when applied to extragalactic O VI absorbers.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n33\n\nlog [N(C III)/N(O VI)]\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u22121\n\n3.5\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n80\nH I b\u2212value (km s\u22121)\n\n100\n\nFig. 26.- Observed H I/O VI ratios vs. H I b\u2212values measured\nin the intervening absorber components that are aligned to within\ntheir 2\u03c3 component centroid uncertainties (filled circles; these are\nthe same data presented in Figure 19 but only for the intervening systems). The observations are compared to predictions from\nthe ionization models of Gnat & Sternberg (2007) for collisional\nionization equilibrium (CIE, dashed line) and for nonequilibrium,\nradiatively cooling models for gas with Z = 0.1Z\u2299 (purple lines),\nZ = 1.0Z\u2299 (red lines), and Z = 2.0Z\u2299 (black lines). For each\nmetallicity, the solid lines show the results for gas cooling isochorically (constant density), and the dotted lines show the isobaric\n(constant pressure) models. The models fail to explain the majority of the observed measurements. The models predict ion fractions\nas a function of gas temperature; we have converted the model temperatures to b\u2212values assuming pure thermal broadening of the\nlines. If non-thermal motions contribute to the line broadening,\nthe discrepancy between the models and the observations is even\nworse.\n\nFirst, nonequilibrium ionization effects depend on the\nmetallicity of the gas and become increasingly important as the metallicity increases. This is expected from\nthe timescale arguments: the cooling rate depends on\nmetallicity, so when the metallicity is low, \u03c4ioneq < \u03c4cool\nand CIE is a good approximation. However, the metallicity at which nonequilibrium effects set in depends on\nthe species. For example, if the overall metallcity [M/H]\n= \u22122, then the nonequilibrium O VI ion fraction is almost identical to the equilibrium ion fraction (compare\nthe thick green and red lines in Figure 25). In comparison, nonequilibrium effects are already significant for\nC III and C IV at [M/H] = \u22122. Even at [M/H] = \u22121,\nthe nonequilibrium O VI ion fraction is quite low at log\nT < 5. From Figure 25, it appears the nonequilibrium\neffects will lead to detectable O VI in cool gas only if the\nmetallicity is relatively high. Nevertheless, we inevitably\nmust compare O VI with other species to discriminate\nbewteen various ionization models, so nonequilbrium effects on other species can affect conclusions about O VI\nsystems.\nFigure 26 shows the observed H I/O VI ratios vs. the\nmeasured H I b\u2212values for the well-matched components\n(filled circles). These measurements are compared to\nthe predicted ratios from the Gnat & Sternberg (2007)\nisochoric models (solid lines) and isobaric models (dotted lines) for the three metallicities. For reference, the\ndashed line plots the CIE ratio from Gnat & Sternberg\n(2007).

The isobaric\nGnat & Sternberg (2007) models fit the observations even more\npoorly than the isochoric models.\n\nat that T for a purely thermally broadened line. We see\nfrom Figure 26 that none of these models agree with the\nbulk of the matched components. In general, at the temperature implied by the narrowness of the observed H I\nlines, the models predict H I/O VI ratios that are too\nhigh. A fraction of the matched absorbers are consistent\nwith the model predictions, but only if the metallicity is\nrelatively high.\nThe Gnat & Sternberg (2007) models have even greater\ndifficulty with the measured C III/O VI ratios and limits.\nFigure 27 compares the observed C III/O VI ratios and\nlimits to the predictions from the isochoric models of\nGnat & Sternberg (2007). In this figure we have retained\nthe temperatures from the model and we have plotted\nthe measured ratios vs. the observed temperatures and\nlimits from Table 7. For the majority of the matched\nintervening components, the models predict C III/O VI\nratios that are one to several orders of magnitude too\nhigh. The isobaric models are not shown in Figure 27,\nbut these models predict even higher C III/O VI ratios\nand thus fit the observed data even more poorly.\nWe conclude that the Gnat & Sternberg (2007)\nnonequilibrium models usually fail the match the observed column-density ratios in the well-aligned O VI\nabsorbers. One caveat, however, is that Gnat & Sternberg (2007) neglect photoionization in their calculations.\nGiven the low densities expected for IGM absorbers\n(see above), photoionization is likely to be important.\nThe combination of nonequilibrium collisional ionization\nplus additional photoionization from impinging UV light\ncould bring the models into better agreement with the\nobservations because photoionization could significantly\n\n\fTripp et al.\n\nreduce the H I and C III columns without reducing\nN (O VI) much, especially if the ionizing radiation is predominantly from stars (which do not emit many photons\nwith sufficient energy to ionize O V into O VI). Of course,\nhow photoionization affects species like C III depends\non the physical conditions of the gas. If the ionization\nparameter is low, photoionization could boost N (C III)\nthereby leading to greater discrepancy with the observations. New nonequilibrium models that include photoionization would be valuable. We will show in \u00a74.1.4\nthat simple models that include both photoionization\nand collisional ionization can satisfy the observational\nconstraints, but realistic modeling of time-dependent effects is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n14.5\nlog [N(O VI) (cm\u22122)]\n\n34\n\n[M/H] = \u22120.5, \u039312 = 0.100\n[M/H]\n[M/H]\n[M/H]\n[M/H] =====\n=\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u22120.5,\n\u0393\n\u0393\u0393\n\u0393\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u0393\n==\n=12\n=\n==0.025\n=\n0.025\n=\n0.025\n0.025\n=0.025\n==\n0.025\n=\n0.025\n0.025\n0.025\n0.025\n0.025\n0.025\n0.025\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n[M/H] = \u22121.0\n[M/H] = \u22121.5\n\n14.0\n\n13.5\n\n13.0\n2\n\nld\n\nsho\n\nlog [N(H I)/N(O VI)]\n\n4.1.3. Photoionization Models\n\nIs collisional ionization required at all in the intervening absorbers? Are the absorber properties consistent\nwith the expected characteristics of purely photoionized\ngas? We have evaluated the viability of pure photoionization as the ionization mechanism using the photoionization code CLOUDY (v96.01, Ferland et al. 1998).\nWe treat the absorbers as plane-parallel slabs photoionized by a background UV radiation field with a specified\nshape and intensity. Apart from the shape and intensity of the ionizing flux, the absorber model properties\ndepend primarily on the ionization parameter U of the\ngas (U \u2261 n\u03b3 /nH = ionizing photon density/total particle\ndensity), the metallicity, and the total hydrogen column\ndensity. We assume that background QSOs and AGNs\nprovide the bulk of the ionizing flux, and we use the\nHaardt & Madau (1996) QSO background but with the\nmodifications provided by Haardt (2006) [for motivation\nof the UV background update, see Madau et al. 1999;\nHaardt & Madau 2001; Shull et al. 1999; Scott et al.\n2004].\nUsually, photoionization models are constrained by requiring the models to fit the measured column densities\nof multiple detected metals such as Si III, C III, and\nC IV (in addition to O VI and H I). With measurements\nfrom multiple species, both the metallicity and the ionization parameter can be constrained by models (e.g.,\nTripp et al. 2002; Savage et al. 2002; Lehner et al.\n2006). Unfortunately, in the majority of our intervening\nO VI systems, we only detect O VI and H I (and occasionally C III). Nevertheless, we can certainly check to see if\nthe photoionization model predictions are consistent with\nthe measurements. In \u00a74.1.2, we showed that the Gnat\n& Sternberg (2007) nonequilibrium collisional ionization\nmodels are clearly not consistent with the observations;\nwill we find a similar result from photoionization models?\nThe ionization parameter depends on the gas density and the ionizing radiation density. To estimate\nthe gas density, we can invoke the arguments presented\nby Schaye (2001), who showed that if an intergalactic\nH I cloud is photoionized and in hydrostatic equilibrium,\nthen the characteristic size of the absorber will be the\nJeans length, and the total hydrogen number density nH\ncan be directly estimated from the H I column density:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\u00152/3\nN (H I)\nfg\n\u22125\n0.17 2/3\nnH \u2248 10\n, (9)\nT4 \u039312\n2.3 \u00d7 1013\n0.16\nwhere we have rearranged Schaye's equation 8 and T4 =\nT (K)/104, \u0393 is the hydrogen photoionization rate, \u039312 =\n\non\n\ncti\n\nte\nDe\n\n1\n\ne\nthr\n\n0\nAGN SED:\n[M/H] = \u22120.5, \u039312 = 0.100\n[M/H] = \u22120.5, \u039312 = 0.025\n\n\u22121\n\u22122\n13\n\n14\n15\nlog [N(H I) (cm\u22122)]\n\n16\n\nFig. 28.- Observed O VI and H I column densities for matched\ncomponents in intervening systems (filled circles); the multicolor\npoints represent components from complex/multiphase absorbers.\nAs in Figure 19, the upper panel shows log N (O VI) vs. log N (H I),\nand the lower panel plots log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] vs. log N (H I).\nThese observations are compared to the predicted column densities\nfrom six photoionization models that assume that the gas density\n(nH ) and the H I column density are related by equation 9 (see\nSchaye 2001) and that the gas is photoionized by the UV background light from QSOs/AGNs (Haardt & Madau 1996; Haardt\n2006). The solid lines represent models that assume that the H I\nphotoionization rate \u039312 = 0.025 (see text), and dashed lines assume \u039312 = 0.100. For each assumed value of \u039312 , models are\nshown with overall metallicities of [M/H] = \u22121.5 (thinnest lines),\n[M/H] = \u22121.0 (thicker lines), and [M/H] = \u22120.5 (thickest lines).\nIn the lower panel an additional two photoionization models that\nassume ionization by an AGN-dominated spectral energy distribution (using the shape from Mathews & Ferland 1987) are also\ncompared to the data (triple-dot-dash lines) for two values of \u039312 .\n\n\u0393(s\u22121 )/1 \u00d7 10\u221212 , and fg is the fraction of the total\nmass contributed by the baryonic gas. Within a reasonable range for gas temperatures of photoionized gas, the\nmodel predictions are not overly sensitive to T ; we assume T = 20,000 K for our calculations. We also assume\nthat fg is close to the \"universal\" value (i.e., \u03a9b /\u03a9m ),\nand following Schaye (2001) we use fg = 0.16. While\nSchaye (2001) derived equation 9 analytically, very similar results for photoionized gas have emerged from hydrodynamic simulations of the IGM (see, e.g. equation\n7 in Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999), and the relationship between\noverdensity and H I column in the simulations has been\ndiscussed in many papers. We will use the results from\nSchaye (2001) in the rest of this paper, but tests show\nthat we would reach similar conclusions if we used the\nrelationship from the simulations instead.\nThe hydrogen photoionization rate depends on the\nshape and intensity of the UV background.

(2001). Based on deep upper limits on H\u03b1 emission\nfrom the H I 1225+01 intergalactic cloud (Giovanelli &\nHaynes 1989), Weymann et al. derive upper limits on\nthe intensity of the UV background at 1 Rydberg, J\u03bd (1\nRyd). Their upper limit depends on the geometry of the\ncloud, and they derive limits ranging from J\u03bd (1 Ryd)\n< 0.96 \u00d7 10\u221223 to < 3.84 \u00d7 10\u221223 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121\nstr\u22121 . For the UV background from QSOs, these intensity limits imply photoionization rates ranging from\n\u039312 \u2248 0.025 to \u039312 \u2248 0.10. These limits are in good\nagreement with constraints obtained from other techniques (see \u00a75 in Dav\u00e9 & Tripp 2001). We will use these\ntwo values for \u039312 to investigate the viability of photoionization models applied to low\u2212z O VI systems. One\nappealing aspect of applying the Schaye arguments to\nphotoionization models is that this ensures that the absorber size is a physically reasonable size \u2013 the absorber\nsize is that which results from hydrostatic equilibrium.\nUsing Schaye's equation 12, we find that the absorber\nsizes are . 750 kpc (450 kpc) for log N (H I) > 13.0 and\n\u039312 = 0.025 (0.100). The corresponding Hubble width\ndue to Hubble broadening is bH \u2248 H(z)L/2 . 28 (17) km\ns\u22121 . This amount of Hubble broadening is quite reasonable compared to the nonthermal broadening estimated\nfor the aligned absorbers (see Table 7).\nUsing equation 9 to specify the gas density and using\nthe modified Haardt & Madau (1996) UV background\nfrom QSOs, Figure 28 compares the predicted O VI and\nH I column densities from several photoionization models to the observed column densities from the matched\nintervening sample (Table 7). In this figure, solid lines\nindicate models that assume \u039312 = 0.025, and dashed\nlines show models that adopt \u039312 = 0.100. For each\nof these \u0393 values, the thin, thicker, and thickest lines\nrepresent models with logarithmic metallicities [M/H] =\n\u22121.5, \u22121.0, and \u22120.5, respectively. In the lower panel of\nFigure 28, we also show the H I/O VI ratio from models\nthat are photoionized by an AGN spectral energy distribution (SED, triple-dot-dash lines), using the Mathews &\nFerland (1987) characterization of the shape of an AGN\nSED, with \u039312 = 0.025 and 0.100. The AGN SED model\nis provided to illustrate the effect of changing the shape\nof the ionizing flux field.\nWe have already noted that there is evidence of substantial metallicity variations in the IGM. It is also likely\nthat the shape as well as the intensity of the ionizing UV\nbackground varies significantly in the IGM. Regions that\nare closer to AGNs/QSOs could naturally be exposed to\na radiation field that is brighter but also has a different\nshape. The contribution from stellar flux escaping from\ngalaxies is uncertain but could also lead to ionizing radiation shape and intensity variations. Finally, the particle density can vary from place to place, which changes\nthe ionization parameter in photoionization models. Figure 28 shows that changes in these variables can lead to\nsignificant variations in the H I/O VI ratio even in simple photoionized models. We see that when the O VI\ndetection threshold is factored in, photoionization models for H I clouds in hydrostatic equilibrium can easily\nexplain the observed O VI and H I properties of many\nof the low\u2212z O VI absorbers. The models can produce\nthe observed column densities, and moreover, the weak\ncorrelation of N (O VI) with N (H I) is a natural result of\n\n2.0\n1.5\nlog [N(H I)/N(O VI)]\n\n36\n\nModels:\nPhotoionization by\nUV bkg. from QSOs/AGNs\n\n1.0\n0.5\nSchaye models\n[M/H] = \u22121.0\n\n0.0\n\u22120.5\n\n[M/H] = \u22120.7, N(H) = 1018.0\ncm\u22122\n[M/H] = \u22120.7, N(H) = 1018.5\ncm\u22122\n18.0\n[M/H] = \u22120.3, N(H) = 1019.0 cm\u22122\n[M/H] = \u22121.0, N(H) = 10 cm\u22122\n\n\u22121.0\n12.5\n\n13.0\n\n13.5\n\n14.0\n14.5\n15.0\nlog [N(H I) (cm\u22122)]\n\n15.5\n\n16.0\n\nFig. 30.- Comparison of the observed H I/O VI ratios in components of intervening systems (filled circles) to the H I/O VI ratios predicted by generic photoionization models (solid and dashed\nlines). The models assume photoionization by the UV background\nfrom quasars and AGNs according to the calculations of Haardt\n& Madau (1996). The variable parameters in the models shown\nare the metallicity, [M/H], the total (H I + H II) hydrogen column\ndensity N (H), and the ionization parameter. The [M/H] and N (H)\nassumed for each curve are indicated in the legend. Lower ionization parameters produce higher H I/O VI ratios. For comparison,\nthe photoionization models that result from invoking Schaye's arguments (i.e., using equation 9) with [M/H] = \u22121.0 are shown with\ndash-dot lines; the thick dash-dot line assumes \u039312 = 0.100, and\nthe thin dash-dot line assumes \u039312 = 0.025.\n\nthese models (as long as the UV background and IGM\nmetallicity are variable in the low-z Universe).\nThe points with the lowest H I/O VI ratios in Figure 28 are not expected in the models photoionized by\nthe Haardt & Madau (1996) UV background unless the\nmetallicity is quite high. However, these points can be\nexplained by models that have a similar metallicity to the\nrest of the sample but are photoionized by an AGN-like\nSED (such models are shown with the triple-dot-dash\nlines in the lower panel of Figure 28), i.e., a harder radiation field. One might wonder if these low H I/O VI\nratios could be measurement artifacts, so we show the\nabsorption profiles for these cases in Figure 29. From\nthis figure, we 4 out of 7 of the lowest-ratio cases are in\nsystems with simple component structure, and the lines\nare securely detected. Therefore, most of the low ratios\nare not simply due to measurement errors. It would be\ninteresting to test whether the low-ratio absorbers are\nfound in closer proximity to a source of harder ionizing\nflux. We do see that the intervening systems with the\nlowest H I/O VI ratios are close to the ratios seen in the\nlow-N (H I) proximate absorbers (see Figure 19). The\nproximate absorbers are close (in redshift) to the background QSO, so these cases are likely to be ionized by a\nradiation field with an AGN SED shape. The similarity\nof the proximate absorbers to the low-ratio intervening\nsystems is consistent with the conclusion that a nearby\nAGN could be dominating the radiation field in all of\nthese cases.\nIt is interesting to see that the physical framework of\nSchaye (2001) naturally explains the observed O VI and\nH I properties of the well-aligned components, but we\nnote that more generic photoionization models that do\nnot invoke equation 9 are also successful. We show several more generic photoionization models in Figure 30.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n13.5\n\n10 19.0\n\n13.0\n\n10 18.5\n\ncm \u22122\n10 18.0\n\n\u22122.0\n\n\u2193\n\n10 17.5\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u22121.0\n\n\u2193\u2193\u2193 \u2193\n\u2193 \u2193\u2193\u2193\n\u2193 \u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\nlog [N(C III)/N(O VI)]\n\nModels: UV bkg.\nphotoionization\n\n\u2193\n\n25 We have assumed a solar C/O ratio for these models, and\nmoreover, we have assumed that the relative abundance of C with\nrespect to O does not depend on the overall metallicity. Some\nstudies (e.g., Akerman et al. 2004) have indicated that C/O is\nnot constant as a function of metallicity and may even have a\nsomewhat complex dependence on metallicity. Accounting for this\ncomplication is beyond the scope of this paper. It would be useful\nto evaluate the impact of departures from solar relative abundances\nin future analyses.\n\n0.0\n\n\u2193\n\nIn these models we have again assumed the modified\nHaardt & Madau (1996) UV background, but we have\nselected various values of Ntotal (H) and [M/H] without requiring nH and N (H I) to be related by equation 9. For a given model, the ionization parameter decreases along the model curve from left to right in Figure 30. For purposes of illustration, in this figure we\nshow N (H I)/N (O VI) vs. N (H I) and we replot the\ntwo Schaye-based models from Figure 28 with [M/H] =\n\u22121.0 and \u039312 = 0.025,0.100. The generic photoionization\nmodels can also reproduce the observed O VI and H I column densities with reasonable values for Ntotal (H) and\n[M/H]. We do note that both the Schaye-based models\nand the generic models require relatively high metallicities (Z & 0.3Z\u2299 ) for some of the O VI systems, which\nmight be somewhat surprising. However, similar metallicities have been indicated by studies of comparable absorbers with detections of multiple metals (e.g., Savage\net al. 2002; Aracil et al. 2006; Lehner et al. 2006).\nEvidently, purely photoionized gas can produce the observed O VI and H I column densities. However, we can\nsee from Figures 28 and 30 that there are substantial degeneracies in the photoionization models when the only\nobservational constraints are from O VI and H I, and it\nwould be very helpful to include constraints from other\nmetals in the ionization analysis. Moreover, we found\nin \u00a74.1.2 that the nonequilibrium collisional ionization\nmodels were able to match some of the H I/O VI ratios but were much harder pressed to fit the C III/O VI\nconstraints. For both of these reasons, we now examine\nwhether our photoionization models are consistent with\nthe observed C III/O VI constraints from Table 7. In\nFigure 31 we compare the C III/O VI constraints to the\npredictions from the Schaye-based and generic photoionization models. In this plot, the model C III/O VI ratios\nare not dependent on metallicity because N (C III) and\nN (O VI) change homologously with metallicity.25 Figure 31 shows that the photoionization models are consistent with the constraints provided by the current observations for a large fraction of the well-aligned components. The generic photoionization models are consistent with all of the measurements provided that the\ntotal hydrogen column (H I + H II) ranges from 1017\nup to & 1019 cm\u22122 . We do notice that the models that\nemploy equation 9 with \u039312 = 0.025 or 0.100 appear\nto be most consistent with the higher N (H I) systems,\nand the Schaye-based models do not fit the four cases\nthat provide the best C III measurements. Since most of\nthe matched intervening O VI systems only provide upper limits on N (C III), the data remain consistent with\nthe Schaye-based models for most of the measurements,\nbut more sensitive measurements of (or upper limits on)\nthe C III column densities would provide a useful test of\nthe Schaye-based photoionization predictions (as shown\nin \u00a75.1.2, future C IV measurements would be similarly\n\n37\n\n14.0\n14.5\nlog [N(H I) (cm\u22122)]\n\n15.0\n\n15.5\n\nFig. 31.- Comparison of the observed C III/O VI ratios vs.\nlog N (H I) in components of intervening systems (with symbols\ncoded as in Figure 27) to the C III/O VI ratios as a function of log\nN (H I) predicted by generic photoionization models (solid lines).\nThe photoionization models assume the Haardt & Madau (1996)\nUV background from QSOs/AGNs. Four model curves are shown\ncorresponding to total (H I + H II) hydrogen columns of log N (H)\n= 17.5, 18.0, 18.5, and 19.0; each model is shown with a solid\ncurve labeled with its total H column [the line thickness increases\nwith N (H)]. The predicted C III/O VI ratios depend primarily on\nthe ionization parameter; increasing the ionization parameter decreases the C III/O VI column density ratio. Changing the overall\nmetallicity of the model does not move the curves in this plot because N (O VI) and N (C III) increase (or decrease) homologously\nwith increasing (or decreasing) metallicity. The gray dashed lines\nrepresent the photoionization models that result from the model of\nSchaye(2001) with \u039312 = 0.025 (thick dashed line) or \u039312 = 0.100\n(thin dashed line).\n\nuseful for testing these models). The Schaye models\nmove toward better agreement with those points if \u039312\nis reduced. Since the best observational constraints still\nprovide only upper limits on \u039312 , this solution remains\na possibility, but it appears that \u039312 must be reduced\nby a large amount. The Schaye-based models can also\nbe moved closer to the well-measured C III/O VI ratios by using a UV background radiation field that includes a greater contribution from stellar flux escaping\nfrom galaxies, but this would upset the agreement with\nthe H I/O VI models. The discrepancy with the best\nC III measurements in Figure 31 could be a symptom of\na serious problem with this model. This could indicate\nthat the clouds are not in hydrostatic equilibrium, for\nexample, or that multiphase models are required even\nfor the apparently simple cases. Future studies should\nrevisit the Schaye-based models with a larger sample of\nmore-sensitive C III and/or C IV measurements.\n4.1.4. Hybrid Models (Collisional and Photoionization)\n\nWe have shown that if the aligned O VI and H I\nlines are cospatial, then the available models in which\nthe gas is predominantly collisionally ionized to do not\nagree with the observed properties of the O VI absorbers\n(\u00a74.1.2). Predominantly photoionized models can explain most of the measurements but often require a relatively high metallicity (\u00a74.1.3). However, the best temperatures implied by the line widths (\u00a74.1.1), while too\ncool to produce O VI in collisional ionization equilibrium,\nare sometimes higher than the temperatures expected in\npredominantly photoionized gas. This raises the question\nof whether photoionization and collisional ionization are\n\n\f38\n\nTripp et al.\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\nlog [N(H I)/N(O VI)]\n\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\u2193\n\n2\n\n\u22121\nModels: collisional + photoionization\n\u22122\nlog U = \u22121.63, [M/H] = \u22121.0\nlog U = \u22121.38, [M/H] = \u22121.0\nlog U = \u22121.13, [M/H] = \u22121.0\nlog U = \u22121.38, [M/H] = 0.0\n\nlog [N(C III)/N(O VI)]\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193 \u2193\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\u2193 \u2193\u2193 \u2193\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n0\n\n4.2.

In some cases,\nthe models and measurements agree with [M/H] = \u22121.0.\nHowever, in the small number of cases where good C III\nmeasurements are available, close inspection shows that\nhigh metallicities are required in these hybrid models as\nwell. Changing the overall metallicity does not change\nthe C III/O VI ratio because both C III and O VI change\nby the same amount. However, the H I/O VI ratio is\ninversely proportional to the metallicity. We thus see\nfrom Figure 32 that in some cases, a better overall fit to\nthe O VI, C III, and H I columns can be obtained with\nhigher metallicities. As we discuss in \u00a75, in the future\nit will important to obtain good measurements of multiple metal species in order to constrain the ionization and\nmetallicity of as many specific systems as possible.\n\n5.5\n\nFig. 32.- Comparison of the observed H I/O VI ratios (upper\npanel) and the observed C III/O VI ratios (lower panel) to four\n\"hybrid\" ionization models that include both collisional ionization\nand photoionization. Both panels show the same ionization models,\nand the symbols have the same meaning as in Figure 27. Three\nof the models assume Z = 0.1Z\u2299 ([M/H] = -1.0) with ionization\nparameters fixed at log U = \u22121.63 (thick solid line), log U = \u22121.38\n(thin solid line), and log U = \u22121.13 (dashed line). The dash-dot\nline assumes Z = 1.0Z\u2299 and log U = \u22121.38. Changing the overall\nmetallicity affects the H I/O VI ratio but does not change the\nC III/O VI ratio. The parameters of the models in this plot were\nchosen for purposes of illustration; these are not fits to the data.\n\nboth important in these absorbers.\nWe can provide a simplified evaluation of whether \"hybrid\" ionization models (i.e., including important contributions from collisional and photoionization) are plausible using CLOUDY. By running CLOUDY with the\nplasma temperature locked at a specified input value and\nincluding photoionization from the UV background, we\ncan assess the effects of the combined ionization mechanisms. Such models solve for ionization equilibrium but\nare not in thermal equilbrium (heating does not balance cooling). In Figure 32 we show CLOUDY models at various fixed temperatures (shown on the x-axis)\nand photoionized by the Haardt & Madau (1996) QSO\nbackground flux. The models are compared to the observed H I/O VI and C III/O VI column-density ratios\nof the aligned components from Table 7. These calculations have three adjustable parameters: the temperature,\nmetallicity, and ionization parameter. The curves show\nmodels with [M/H] = \u22121 and [M/H] = 0 (Z = 0.1Z\u2299\nand 1.0Z\u2299 ) and three values for the ionization parameter. Our intention here is not to fit the ratios but\nto assess whether or not the models are plausible. We\nsee that with reasonable values for the temperature and\n\nSystems\nEvidently, many of the well-aligned systems show compelling indications of cool gas (T < 105 K), and among\ncurrently available models, these cool absorbers are best\nexplained as photoionized gas. Is there any observational\nevidence of the WHIM in the nearby universe then? Xray absorption lines (e.g., the O VII K\u03b1 transition) are\npotentially useful for finding WHIM gas because the Xray absorbers persist in hotter plasmas. X-ray spectroscopy has been used to search for the WHIM, and\nwhile some redshifted X-ray absorption lines have been\nreported (e.g., Fang et al. 2002; Mathur et al. 2003;\nNicastro et al. 2005), the reliability of the detections\nhas been debated (Kaastra et al. 2006; Rasmussen et al.\n2002,2007; Bregman 2007; but see also Fang et al. 2007;\nWilliams et al. 2007). X-ray absorption lines have been\nrobustly detected at zabs \u2248 0 (e.g., Nicastro et al. 2002;\nFang et al. 2006), but there is evidence that the zabs \u2248 0\nX-ray absorbers arise in gas clouds that are relatively\nclose to the Milky Way (Futamoto et al. 2004; Wang et\nal. 2005; Fang et al. 2006), perhaps even within a few\nkpc of the Milky Way disk (Yao & Wang 2005), and thus\nare more likely to be hot Galactic ISM gas than WHIM\nclouds.\nIn the ultraviolet bandpass, the strongest evidence\nof WHIM-temperature plasma is the 3.9\u03c3 detection of\nNe VIII reported by Savage et al. (2005) in the strong\nO VI absorber at zabs = 0.20701 toward HE0226-4110.\nIn this case, the Ne VIII column cannot be produced in\nplausible photoionization models, and the Ne VIII/O VI\nratio requires T = 5.4 \u00d7 105 K in collisional ionization\nequilibrium. It is interesting to note that this absorber is\na complex case with multiple components in the H I profiles and low-ion metals that trace cooler (probably photoionized) phases of the absorption system. Other multiphase, multicomponent O VI absorbers have similarly\nbeen argued to have characteristics of warm-hot collisionally ionized gas (e.g., Chen & Prochaska 2000; Tripp et\nal. 2000; Prochaska et al. 2004; Shull et al. 2003; Tumlinson et al. 2005). The fact that all of these systems\nthat present evidence of hot gas are multiphase absorbers\nraises a question: is the warm-hot gas primarily located\nin the complex multiphase absorbers? This is a crucial\nquestion for the inventory of baryons in the low\u2212z IGM\n(see \u00a75.1.1). We have classified roughly half of the intervening sample as multiphase absorbers (\u00a72.4.2).

In the second and third panels, the thin\nred line shows the three-component fit, and the thick dashed green\nline shows an alternative fit that uses only two components (the\nbottom panel shows the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line, which is fitted with\na single component). The top panel shows the difference between\nthe alternative fits to the H I profiles: the three-component fit\nuses two narrow components (shown with a thin-red line) to fit the\ninflections in the wings of the Ly\u03b1 profile, but the two component\nfit employs a single broad feature (shown with a thick green line)\nto fit these features. The H I Ly\u03b2 profile is partially affected by a\nblend with Milky Way H2 absorption (see Sembach et al. 2001).\nXs mark unrelated absorption.\n\nthey are intrinsically complex, multiphase O VI systems\noften require detailed analyses (e.g., Tripp et al. 2001;\nRichter et al. 2004; Sembach et al. 2004; Savage et al.\n2005; Tumlinson et al. 2005). Complete analysis of the\nfull sample of multiphase absorbers is beyond the goals\nof this paper. However, it is useful to present a few examples of how the WHIM can be difficult to identify in\nmultiphase absorbers.\nOne problem with multiphase absorbers arises from\nlimitations of Voigt-profile fitting when dealing with\ncomplex component structure (\u00a72.3). In moderate S/N\ndata, the appropriate number of components to fit to a\nmulticomponent profile can be ambiguous, and this can\nhave a substantial impact on the results for some of the\n\n39\n\ncomponents. Figure 33 shows the zabs = 0.00334 absorber toward 3C 273.0, which provides an example of\nthis problem. In this case, the Ly\u03b1 profile clearly shows\na significant but blended absorption feature at v \u2248 \u221250\nkm s\u22121 . This feature cannot be caused by the main H I\ncomponent at v = 0 km s\u22121 and this motivates a fit\nwith at least two components. However, the positivevelocity side of the Ly\u03b1 profile is also asymmetric with\na \"ledge\" of pixels at v \u2248 35 km s\u22121 (most easily seen in\nthe upper panel of Figure 33). This asymmetry suggests\nthe presence of a third component. But in these data,\nsystematic noise could be the origin of the ledge feature.\nThe second and third panels in Figure 33 compare the results from a two-component fit (dashed green line) to the\nthree-component fit (thin red line). The two-component\nfit provides a somewhat better reduced \u03c72\u03bd = 1.15 (compared to \u03c72\u03bd = 1.33 for the three-component model) and\nthus was favored in Table 3. However, the improvement\nin \u03c72\u03bd mainly results from a better fit to the Ly\u03b2 profile,\nwhich is confused by blending with Galactic H2 absorption, and the two models fit the Ly\u03b1 profile comparably\nwell. The main H I component does not change much\nin the two- vs. three-component fit, but as shown in the\ntop panel of Figure 33, the properties of the weaker component(s) are dramatically different in the two fits. The\ntwo-component fit requires a very broad H I component\nthat is aligned with the O VI absorption within the 1\u03c3\ncentroid uncertainties. The three-component fit, on the\nother hand, results in three narrow H I lines (the main\ncomponent plus the two weaker components shown with\na red line in the top panel of Figure 33), and while the\nO VI is still aligned with the main component, in this\ncase b(O VI) \u226b b(H I), which is unphysical. The O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 line is detected at the 4.5\u03c3 level in the FUSE\nspectrum of 3C 273.0, but the line is broad and shallow. It is possible that the O VI profile is composed of\nthree components that align with three H I components,\nbut we cannot discern the O VI components at the available resolution and S/N ratio. Thus, this system is difficult to interpret. To overcome these fitting problems\nrequires excellent data with high spectral resolution and\nhigh S/N.\nThis problem with identification of broad Ly\u03b1 components in multiphase systems is exacerbated by high H I\ncolumn densities. Consider the strong O VI absorber at\nzabs = 0.20266 toward PKS0312-770 (shown in Figures 2\nand 3). In this absorber, one or more of the components\nhave N (H I) & 1017 cm\u22122 , which produces a \"boxcar\"\nLy\u03b1 absorption profile with a black core over a large velocity range (see the upper left panel of Figure 2). In\nthis case, if there is a broad and relatively shallow H I\ncomponent that arises in the O VI-bearing gas, it would\nlikely be impossible to detect. Such a component would\nhave miniscule optical depth in higher Lyman series lines\nand thus would be undetectable at available S/N levels,\nand in the Ly\u03b1 profile, it would be hidden in the black\ncore of the boxcar profile.\nAnd, there is some evidence that broad shallow Ly\u03b1\ncomponents could be present in the the high\u2212N (H I),\nmultiphase absorbers. Figure 34 presents an example.\nThis figure shows the H1821+643 O VI absorbers at zabs\n= 0.22496 and 0.22638 (plotted in the zabs = 0.22638\nframe). Focusing first on the zabs = 0.22497 system, we\nsee that this is a multiphase metal system that is similar\n\n\f40\n\nTripp et al.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nH1821+643\nzabs = 0.22638\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nC III \u03bb977.02\n\n1\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n0\n\n0.0\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nSi III \u03bb1206.50\n0\n\nH1821+643\nzabs = 0.22638\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b3\n0\n\n0.0\n\nx\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u0398\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n-600\n\n-400\n-200\n0\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n200\n\n0.0\n\n-600\n\n-400\n-200\n0\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n200\n\nFig. 34.- Selected absorption profiles (histograms) of the complex, multiphase O VI absorbers at zabs = 0.22496 and 0.22638 in the\nspectrum of H1821+643 (plotted in the zabs = 0.22638 frame). Voigt-profile fits are overplotted with smooth lines in each panel, and the\nvertical lines indicate the v = 0 km s\u22121 points for zabs = 0.22496 and 0.22638 (i.e., the centroids of the O VI absorbers). As discussed in\nthe text, several aspects of these absorbers suggest the presence of hot gas. The H I panels show a comparison of two comparably good fits\nto the H I Lyman series lines in the complex, multiphase O VI absorber at zabs = 0.22496. The red line shows the fit reported in Table 3,\nand the dotted green line shows an alternative H I fit with the velocity centroid of one H I component locked to the centroid of the O VI\nlines. The column density and b\u2212value of the H I component with the locked velocity centroid are freely varied in the alternative fit (only\nthe centroid is locked). The locked component in the final fit is shown with a thick green line in the top-left panel. Unrelated absorption\nlines are denoted with Xs.\n\nto the PKS0312-770 absorber shown in Figure 2. Comparing the C III, Si III, and O VI lines, we see that the\nC III and Si III profiles show three narrow components\nthat are well-aligned. In contrast, the O VI profiles are\nsmoother and clearly have different component structure.\nThese profile differences are not due to thermal broadening and different species masses because carbon and\noxygen have similar masses. Rather, these differences\nare due to multiple phases in this absorber. Now, turning to the H I Lyman series lines, we see that the two\nmain, high\u2212N (H I) components are well-constrained by\nthe higher series lines. However, our original H I fit (in\nTable 3) did not result in any broad Ly\u03b1 components,\nnor did it indicate any components that are aligned with\nthe centroid of the O VI absorption. Following our usual\nprocedure, the original fit allowed all component parameters (v, b, and N ) to freely vary during the fitting process.\nInterestingly, if we lock the velocity centroid of only one\n\nof the components to equal the centroid of the strongest\nO VI component (and we allow all the other parameters to vary freely), we obtain a comparably good fit.\nHowever, the locked component results in a broad Ly\u03b1\n\u22121\ncomponent with b(H I) = 81+13\nand log N (H I)\n\u221211 km s\n= 13.80\u00b10.09 at the O VI velocity. The two fits to the\nH I lines are shown in Figure 34 with a red line and a\ndotted green line, and the broad Ly\u03b1 line resulting from\nthe locked\u2212v fit is indicated with a thick green line in the\nupper-left panel of Figure 34. We can see that the two\nfits are nearly indistinguishable, and the fits have nearly\nidentical goodness of fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.030 vs. \u03c72\u03bd = 1.031). Between the two fits, the main two components (i.e., the two\ncomponents evident in the higher Lyman series) change\nby tiny amounts; the changes occur in the weaker components required to fit the structure in the wings of the\nLy\u03b1 and \u03b2 profiles. However, these changes in the weak\noutlying components have major implications for the gas\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\nH1821+643, zabs = 0.22638\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1\n\n41\n\nH1821+643, zabs = 0.24531\n\n1\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\nPHL1811, zabs = 0.15786\n\n1\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\n1\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n\n1\n\n1\n[M/H] = \u22121.0\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\u2212300 \u2212150\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\n0\n\n150\n\nCIE log T:\n5.30\n5.48\n5.60\n5.70\n5.78\n5.84\n\nO I,\nzabs =\n0.08092\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n0\n300 \u2212300 \u2212150\n0\n150 300 \u2212300 \u2212150\nAbsorber Velocity (km s\u22121)\n\n0\n\n150\n\n300\n\nFig. 35.- Examples of the comparison of predicted H I Ly\u03b1 lines, assuming the O VI arises in equilibrium collisionally ionized gas with\nZ = 0.1Z\u2299 , to the observed Ly\u03b1 absorption profiles. The left and middle panels show the H1821+643 absorption systems at zabs = 0.22638\nand 0.24531, respectively, and the right panel shows the PHL1811 system at zabs = 0.15786. In each panel, the upper histogram indicates\nthe continuum-normalized O VI \u03bb1031.93 profile and the lower histogram is the Ly\u03b1 line. Note that the PHL1811 Ly\u03b1 line at zabs =\n0.15786 is blended with O I \u03bb1302.17 absorption from the Lyman-limit absorber at zabs = 0.08092 discussed by Jenkins et al. (2005); the\nnarrow core is due to the O I line. The smooth curve overplotted on the O VI line is the Voigt-profile fit from Table 3. Using the O VI\ncolumn density from the Voigt-profile fit, we have determined the corresponding column density and b\u2212value that the H I would have if\nit were in CIE with Z = 0.1Z\u2299 and log T = 5.30, 5.48, 5.60, 5.70, 5.78, and 5.84. The predicted Ly\u03b1 profiles for the different assumed\ntemperatures are represented by different line shades as indicated in the key in the middle panel. For purposes of discussion, we show the\nmodels for all of these temperatures in the middle panel, but we only plot the models with log T = 5.30, 5.48, and 5.60 in the left and\nright panels. In this figure, the data have been binned to 7 km s\u22121 pixels in order to better reveal any weak structure in the wings of the\nprofiles.\n\nconditions. If we use the H I b\u2212value from the locked fit\ntogether with the main-component O VI b\u2212value, these\nmeasurements imply that the temperature of the O VI\n-bearing gas is log T = 5.47. Assuming the H I and O VI\nion fractions from collisional ionization equilibrium at\nthis temperature, the measured column densities would\nthen imply an oxygen abundance of [O/H] = \u22121.4.\nThese examples show that broad H I components could\nbe present in the complex profiles, and in some cases,\nthe combination of broad H I and O VI is consistent\nwith WHIM temperatures and relatively low metallicities. These results are intriguing, but we must recognize that this only shows that hot gas is allowed by the\ndata; these analyses do not uniquely require the presence\nof WHIM material. Without additional information, it\ncan be difficult to discriminate between the fits shown in\nthese examples. As noted, high S/N and spectral resolution would be helpful for constraining the physical conditions in these absorbers. Also, ancillary species such as\nNe VIII can be immensely valuable for identification of\nhot gas (e.g., Savage et al. 2005). X-ray absorption lines\nwould also be useful, but the spectral resolution available\nin the X-ray bandpass is still quite limited.\n\n4.2.1. Hidden Broad H I Components?\n\nFigure 34 demonstrates another notable characteristic\nof multiphase absorbers. We have remarked above that\nmultiphase systems have larger velocity offsets between\nthe H I and O VI centroids (see Figure 6). The zabs\n= 0.22638 absorber in Figure 34 shows an example of\none of the largest velocity offsets between H I and O VI\nin an intervening absorber: in this system, the O VI is\ndetected v = 0 km s\u22121 while H I and weak C III are found\nat v = \u221254 km s\u22121 . Some H I absorption is present in\nthe velocity range where O VI is detected, but this could\nbe just the wing of the H I line at \u221254 km s\u22121 . Why does\nthis well-detected O VI absorber have so little affiliated\nH I? One possibility is that this absorber is similar to the\nproximate absorbers and has a very high metallicity so\nthat the affiliated H I column is too low to be detected.\nHowever, another possibility is that this particular\nO VI doublet arises in collisionally ionized hot plasma\nwith a temperature that makes the H I difficult to detect. The measured O VI b\u2212value is 16 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich is consistent with gas at T \u2248 105.5 . The left panel\nof Figure 35 shows theoretical H I Ly\u03b1 profiles that would\nbe expected to be affiliated with this O VI absorber in\ncollisionally ionized gas at log T = 5.30, 5.48, and 5.60\n\n\f42\n\nTripp et al.\n\nwith Z = 0.1Z\u2299 . These predicted H I profiles use the\nGnat & Sternberg (2007) CIE ion fractions to predict\nthe H I column density (based on the measured N (O VI)\nand assumed metallicity), and the line widths are for the\npurely thermally broadened case (nonthermal broadening can only make the H I lines broader). We see that\nwith log T = 5.30, a strong (and easily detected) H I\nline is expected (red line in Figure 35). The H I line is\nstrong because even though the H I ion fraction is low\nat this T , the O VI ion fraction drops very rapidly at log\nT < 5.5 (see Figure 25), and consequently, N (H I) has\nto be high in order to produce the observed N (O VI). Of\ncourse, N (O VI) can be increased by increasing Z and/or\nN (H I); an alternative solution is that Z \u226b 0.1Z\u2299 . However, we see from Figure 35 that if log T = 5.48 or 5.60,\nclose to the temperature of peak O VI abundance in CIE,\nthen the affiliated N (H I) is low enough so that the expected Ly\u03b1 profile (yellow or green lines in Figure 35)\nwould be difficult or impossible to detect at the current\nS/N levels. Thus, this system could be in the warm-hot\nrange with a realistic metallicity, and the expected broad\nH I would be hidden in the noise.\nThis raises a question: could similar \"hidden\" broad\ncomponents be present in the aligned components discussed in \u00a74.1.1? The middle panel of Figure 35 explores\nthis possibility. This panel shows the well-aligned H I\nand O VI absorption lines at zabs = 0.24531 in the spectrum of H1821+643 with theoretical Ly\u03b1 profiles, calculated as described in the previous paragraph, for log\nT = 5.30, 5.48, 5.60, 5.70, 5.78, and 5.84. We see that\nnone of these model Ly\u03b1 profiles fit the observed Ly\u03b1\nline very well. However, if this is a multiphase absorber\nwith a narrow core from a lower-ionization phase that\ndoes not contribute to the O VI absorption, then a broad\ncomponent would be allowed by the data as long as the\ntemperature is in a narrow range (or Z \u226b 0.1Z\u2299 ). We\nsee that as above, warm-hot gas with log T \u2248 5.30 or\nless is ruled out. Likewise, models with log T & 5.6 are\nruled out; these models lead to Ly\u03b1 profiles that are too\nstrong and too broad. We conclude that this aligned\nO VI \u2212 H I absorber could harbor a hidden broad Ly\u03b1\ncomponent arising in the hot O VI phase, but only if\nthe absorber is multiphase and the temperature is finetuned to a relatively narrow range near the O VI peak\ntemperature and/or the metallicity is relatively high.\nWe noted in \u00a74.1.1 that some of the aligned absorbers\nare outside of the physically allowed range of b(H I) and\nb(O VI). Occasionally, these unphysical cases could be\ndue to coincidental alignment with unrelated absorption\nlines. The right panel of Figure 35 shows an example\nof coincidental alignment with unrelated absorption in\nthe O VI absorber at zabs = 0.15786 toward PHL1811.\nIn this case, an apparently very narrow H I line seems\nto be aligned with the strongest component of a multicomponent O VI profile, and the candidate H I line is\ntoo narrow (compared to O VI) to be in the physically\nallowed regime. This unphysical combination is due to\ncoincidental alignment of the O VI with an unrelated\nline: the narrow component in this case is actually not\nH I but rather is the O I \u03bb1302.17 line from the Lyman\nlimit absorber at zabs = 0.08092 (see Jenkins et al. 2005).\nHowever, close inpection of the profile reveals weak absorption in the wings of the narrow O I feature. Those\nweak absorption wings do not appear to be due to O I\n\nbecause that component structure is not corroborated\nby stronger metal-line profiles of other low ions at the\nO I redshift. The weak components could be due to H I\nLy\u03b1 absorption at the O VI redshift. Interestingly, if the\ntwo O VI components at zabs = 0.15786 have log T =\n5.48 and Z \u2248 0.1Z\u2299 , then the two expected broad Ly\u03b1\ncomponents associated with the O VI would explain the\nweak components in the wings of the O I profile (see the\nyellow line in Figure 35).\nHidden broad Ly\u03b1 lines are allowed for most of the intervening O VI absorbers. As shown in columns 4 and\n5 of Table 7, the O VI line widths usually allow temperatures near the O VI peak (log T \u2248 5.5), and given\nthe typical N (O VI), at this temperature an affiliated\nbroad Ly\u03b1 component would usually be hidden in the\nnoise. This explanation requires that essentially all of\nthe intervening O VI absorbers are multiphase because\nanother (O VI-free) phase is required to explain the rest\nof the Ly\u03b1 absorption. For many of the absorbers, the\ntemperature or metallicity must be tuned to avoid producing overly strong broad Ly\u03b1. However, some of the\nstrong multiphase systems have broad features that could\nbe due to O VI at somewhat lower temperatures (e.g.,\nTripp et al. 2001). This scenario is similar to the favored models for the O VI HVCs seen in the vicinity of\nthe Milky Way (Sembach et al. 2003).\n4.2.2. O VI in Interface Layers?\n\nThe correlation of log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] with log\nN (H I) could be an indication that the O VI absorption\narises in some type of interface layer on the surface of a\nlower-ionization H I cloud. In this argument, the O VI\ncolumn density is determined by the interface physics\nand is independent of the H I column density of the interior cloud. This scenario is not required by the data: we\nhave shown in Figure 28 and \u00a74.1.3 that photoionization\nmodels can explain the correlation if the IGM metallicity and UV background shape and intensity are variable.\nHowever, we have also shown in the previous section that\nthe current data cannot rule out hidden broad Ly\u03b1 lines\nthat would indicate that the O VI arises in a hot phase\nthat is closely aligned in velocity with a cooler lowerionization phase that produces the bulk of the detected\nH I absorption.\nTo evaluate this hypothesis, it is useful to consider\nFUSE observations of O VI absorption detected in the\nvery local interstellar medium (LISM) within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun (Oegerle et al. 2005; Savage &\nLehner 2006). In these samples, the short pathlength\nto the background star (d \u2264 230 pc) precludes production of O VI by photoionization. In addition, the Sun is\nsurrounded by a bubble of hot, X-ray emitting gas with\nT \u2248 106 K (e.g., Smith et al. 2007), so this context provides observational information on the properties of O VI\nabsorption arising in interface layers.\nInterestingly, Savage & Lehner (2006) find that find\n\u224840% of the O VI absorption line velocity centroids in\nthe LISM are aligned with C II absorption centroids to\nwithin \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 (see their Figure 11). This supports\nthe hypothesis that O VI could originate in an interface\nwithout having different kinematics (velocity centroids)\ncompared to the low-ionization phase. However, Savage\n& Lehner also find that more than half of their local O VI\nlines show clear and significant velocity offsets. Overall,\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\nthe velocity offsets of the LISM O VI absorbers appear to\nbe similar to those observed in the extragalactic O VI systems of this paper. However, there is a significant difference between LISM O VI absorbers and the extragalactic\nsystems: the LISM O VI column densities are substantially lower. Savage & Lehner find 12.38 \u2264log N (O VI)\n\u2264 13.60 in the LISM with a median of log N (O VI) =\n13.10. These observed LISM columns are comparable to\nthe N (O VI) values theoretically predicted to be found\nin conductive interfaces between cool clouds and hot gas\n(e.g., Slavin 1989; Borkowski et al. 1990), but the extragalactic N (O VI) measurements are up to \u224850 times\nhigher. Therefore, many interfaces are required to explain the QSO O VI systems according to these interface\nmodels and LISM observations. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the extragalactic absorbers are\nlikely to have significantly lower metallicities than the\nLISM systems; lower metallicity will further reduce the\nN (O VI) expected in an interface. With the requirement\nof many interfaces to produce the observed N (O VI), we\nwould expect to find complexity in the absorption profiles (due to variations of the H I/O VI ratios and H I\nvs. O VI kinematics from one cloud to the next within\nthe multilayer system). Some of the QSO O VI profiles\nshow considerable complexity, but others appear to be\nrelatively simple. Given this problem, it is not clear if\ninterface models can fit the properties of the simple extragalactic systems.\nHowever, we note that other models of interstellar O VI\nproduction (see Table 1 in Indebetouw & Shull 2004),\nsuch as radiatively cooling clouds or bubbles blown by\nsupernovae/stellar winds, do predict O VI columns that\nare substantially higher. We also note that in a survey\nof 148 Milky Way stars, Bowen et al. (2007) find that\nthe scatter in N (O VI) does not decrease with increasing\nsight line pathlength, which indicates that the O VI absorption lines do not arise in clouds with a fixed size and\ndensity. These factors suggest that collisionally ionized\nhot O VI can originate in a variety of contexts with significant variations in cloud characteristics. The Milky Way\nO VI HVCs (Sembach et al. 2003; Wakker et al. 2003)\nsuffer a similar problem to the extragalactic systems: the\nO VI in Galactic HVCs is thought to arise in interfaces\n(e.g., Sembach et al. 2003; Ganguly et al. 2005), but the\nobserved HVC O VI columns tend to be substantially\ngreater than the expected N (O VI) in interfaces. We\nconclude that the interface physics may not yet be sufficiently well-understood or is oversimplified in available\nmodels. While there are some significant discrepancies,\nthe interface hypothesis for the origin for extragalactic\nO VI absorbers is viable and deserves further study.\n5. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE OBSERVATIONS\n5.1. Intervening Absorbers\n5.1.1. Baryonic Content and Missing Baryons\n\nWhat do these analyses imply about the baryonic content of the low\u2212z IGM and the missing baryons? Several\nprevious papers have shown that low-redshift O VI absorbers harbor roughly 5% of the baryons in the nearby\nUniverse (Tripp et al. 2000,2006b; Savage et al. 2002;\nSembach et al. 2004; Danforth & Shull 2005; Lehner et\nal. 2006). Most of these papers have assumed that the\nmean metallicity of the O VI systems is ZO VI = 0.1Z\u2299\n\n43\n\nand that the O VI ion fraction (fO VI = O VI/Ototal) is\nless than \u2248 0.2. The latter assumption is secure (see, e.g.,\nthe Appendix in Tripp & Savage 2000), but as noted by\nLehner et al. (2006) and as discussed above, many recent\nstudies have found Z > 0.1Z\u2299 in nearby IGM absorbers.\n\u22121\n\u22121\nThe absorber baryonic content \u03a9b (O VI) \u221d ZO\nVI fO VI ,\nso increased metallicity decreases the baryonic content\nby the same factor. The uncertain metallicity of the\nabsorbers is currently a large source of uncertainty in\n\u03a9b (O VI). New measurements of \u03a9b (O VI) should employ detailed metallicity constraints for each absorber in\nthe sample instead of assuming a mean ZO VI , or at least\nthe assumed value for ZO VI should be based on a sample of measured metallicities. Unfortunately, many of the\nO VI systems are only detected in O VI and H I. With\nonly these two species, the metallicity of the systems remains uncertain. Better constraints on \u03a9b (O VI) will\nrequire secure measurements of other metals in the O VI\nabsorbers.\nHowever, another problem with \u03a9b (O VI) estimates is\nthat most previous studies have included all intervening\nO VI absorption systems in the \u03a9b (O VI) measurement\nregardless of the physical conditions of the absorbers.\nThe contribution to the baryon budget from low\u2212z photoionized gas has been separately estimated from studies\nof Ly\u03b1 lines (e.g., Penton et al. 2004; Lehner et al. 2007)\nand is often included in baryon inventories (e.g., Fukugita\net al. 1998), so by including photoionized and collisionally ionized O VI systems together in a single estimate of\n\u03a9b (O VI), some double-counting of baryons could occur.\nTo avoid this double counting, \u03a9b\u2212Total (O VI) should\nbe split into \u03a9b\u2212WHIM (O VI) and \u03a9b\u2212Photo (O VI), the\nbaryonic content of WHIM and photoionized O VI systems. Our physical conditions analysis indicates that at\nleast 34% of the intervening O VI components present\ncompelling evidence of cool temperatures (log T < 5.0).\nHowever, we also found in \u00a74.1.1 that at least 14% of the\nO VI components have log T > 4.6, which is hotter than\nthe temperatures typically expected in photoionized intergalactic gas.\nThe intermediate-temperature cases with log T > 4.6\ncould arise in plasma that was initially shock-heated and\nis now rapidly radiatively cooling. Shock-heated gas with\nT < 105 K is predicted by some theoretical models,\nso these intermediate-temperature O VI systems could\nbe WHIM material. Kang et al. (2005) report that\nin their hydrodynamic models of cosmological structure\ngrowth, many sheet-like structures are shock-heated and\ncontain material that conceptually should be classified\nas \"WHIM\" plasma, but in their models, the shock velocities are lower, and they conclude that an important\nfraction of the baryons are in the shocked IGM but with\nT < 105 K, which they refer to as the \"low-temperature\"\nWHIM. Kang et al. (2005) analyze the physical conditions and ionization of the low-temperature WHIM, and\nthey find that this IGM phase is predominantly photoionized. Moreover, they note that \u2248 60% of the O VI absorbers originate in the low-temperature, photoionized\nWHIM in their simulations. The models of Kang et al.\n(2005) are consistent with the observational constraints\nthat we have derived in this paper.\nWe have also noted that the O VI absorbers that provide the strongest evidence of T > 105 K plasma tend\n\n\fTripp et al.\n\n5.1.2. Future Studies of Intervening Absorbers\n\nSeveral future observations would be valuable for gaining insight about the low\u2212z IGM. First, it will be important to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra. In addition to revealing weaker O VI and ancillary metal lines,\n\n0.0\n\nModels: UV bkg.\nphotoionization\n\n10 1\n\n9.0\n\n10 18\n.5\n\n\u22121.0\n\n10 18\n.0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n10 17\n.5\ncm \u2212\n2\n\nto be complex, multiphase absorbers with multiple H I\ncomponents (some of which do not have associated O VI)\nand (in some cases) clear absorption by low ionization\nstages. In these multicomponent, multiphase systems, it\nis easy to hide a broad H I component that would be\nassociated with hot O VI. We classify 53% of the intervening systems as complex/multiphase absorbers, and\nthese complex systems could be the primary harbor of\nthe T > 105 K plasma. In fact, some of the simulations show that T > 105 K plasma is often surrounded\nby cooler gas, and these simulations predict these \"embedded\" WHIM locations produce peaks in O VI density\nmaps (see, e.g., Figures 4-6 in Cen & Ostriker 2006). It\nseems likely that random sight lines through the cosmological simulations would often find that the WHIM is located in regions where cooler gas phases are also present,\nand consequently O VI from these regions will be affiliated with complex, multicomponent H I and lower-ion\nprofiles at similar velocities, like some of the observed\nmultiphase O VI systems. Theoretical predictions regarding the characteristics of O VI and H I profiles in\nvarious environments would be helpful for checking the\nconsistency of the models and the observations.\nIt should also be borne in mind that the detectability of O VI depends on the metallicity of the gas. If\nthe missing baryons are predominantly located in gas\nthat is shock-heated when it first accretes into galaxy potentials, then the WHIM plasma could have a relatively\nlow metallicity, and O VI could be difficult to detect in\nthe WHIM phase in currently available data. Instead\nof O VI, broad H I Ly\u03b1 lines (BLAs) can be used to\nsearch for the low\u2212z WHIM, and several studies have\nreported detections of BLA candidates at low redshifts\n(Tripp et al. 2001; Bowen et al. 2002; Richter et al.\n2004,2006a,b; Sembach et al. 2004; Lehner et al. 2007).\nOnly a small fraction of the reported BLAs are also detected in O VI (the O VI doublet is covered but not detected in most cases). We can show that the lack of affiliated O VI absorption is consistent with a WHIM origin\nfor the BLAs. The approximate carbon metallicity of the\nhigh-redshift IGM is [C/H] . \u22122.5 (Schaye et al. 2003).\nIf the low-redshift WHIM has a similar metallicity, then\nusing the O VI and H I ion fractions from Gnat & Sternberg (2007), we find that N (O VI)/N (H I) . 0.25. Since\nmost low\u2212z BLAs have N (H I) . 1014 cm\u22122 (Lehner\net al. 2007), in collisionally ionized plasma we predict\nthat the corresponding N (O VI) . 1013.4 cm\u22122 , which is\ncomparable to the lowest O VI columns that we are currently able to reliably detect. Since the WHIM metallicity could be substantially lower than \u22122.5, and because\nN (O VI)/N (H I) . 0.25 is derived at the peak of the\nO VI/H I vs. temperature curve, the O VI/H I ratios\ncould be substantially lower in BLAs. Thus, it may not\nbe surprising that O VI is not usually detected in the\nBLAs. In a recent study of the low\u2212z H I lines detected\nin STIS echelle spectra, Lehner et al. (2007) estimate\nthat at least \u2248 20% of baryons could be found in broad\nLy\u03b1 absorbers.\n\nlog [N(C IV)/N(O VI)]\n\n44\n\n\u22121.5\n13.0\n\n13.5\n\n14.0\n14.5\nlog [N(H I) (cm\u22122)]\n\n15.0\n\n15.5\n\nFig. 36.- Predicted C IV/O VI vs. N (H I) from the same\nphotoionization models presented in Figure 31 with the same line\ncodes.\n\nhigher S/N ratios will help to establish whether the BLAs\nare truly single-component, smooth and broad Gaussian\nfeatures. Current data often suggest that H I lines are\nBLAs, but due to modest S/N, it remains possible that\nthese BLA candidates are actually unrecognized blends\nof several adjacent components (see, e.g., Richter et al.\n2006b). With higher S/N, it will often be possible to recognize profile asymmetries that reflect multiple, blended\ncomponents. High S/N is also crucial for probing the\npresence of hidden broad Ly\u03b1 components that could be\nassociated with collisionally ionized O VI (\u00a74.2.1). Second, it will be useful to detect other species, including\nO III, O IV, and O V as well as ions of other elements, to\nenable more constrained modeling of the ionization and\nmetallicity of the absorbers. We have discussed the utility of C III in this regard. The Ne VIII \u03bb\u03bb770.41, 780.32\ndoublet is an important doublet for future studies since\nit probes plasma with T \u2248 6\u00d7105 K (Savage et al. 2005),\nbut with the HST bandpass, this will only be accessible in\nintermediate-redshift absorbers (zabs & 0.50). The C IV\n\u03bb\u03bb1548.21, 1550.78 doublet will be an important metal\nto search for in many O VI systems. Figure 36 shows the\nC IV/O VI ratios predicted by the various photoionization models considered in \u00a74.1.3. From this figure, we see\nthat the C IV/O VI ratio is usually significantly greater\nthan the corresponding C III/O VI ratio in photoionized O VI systems. The N V \u03bb\u03bb1238.82, 1242.80 doublet\nis also useful and has been occasionally detected (e.g.,\nSavage et al. 2002; Tumlinson et al. 2005). The N V\ndoublet is weaker and more difficult to detect, but this\ncan be overcome with high S/N observations. A greater\ndifficulty with nitrogen is that it can be underabundant\ndue to nucleosynthesis effects in low-metallicity gas (e.g.,\nHenry et al. 2000), which can cause confusion in ionization models. Bearing such effects in mind, with measurement of two or more metals as well as H I, it will\nbe possible to place specific, precise constraints on the\nphysical conditions and metal enrichment of the low\u2212z\nIGM.\nMore detailed comparisons between the observations\nand theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations would also be instructive. The Kang et al. simulations predict that a large fraction of the low\u2212z O VI\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n5.2. Proximate Absorbers\n5.2.1. Evidence of AGN Feedback?\n\nOne of the goals of our survey is to search for evidence\nof feedback from outflows driven by QSOs/AGNs (see\n\u00a71). Some papers have argued that a significant fraction of QSO absorption lines with vdispl > 5000 km s\u22121\nare actually intrinsic QSO absorption systems that have\nbeen ejected by the QSO/AGN and accelerated to dramatic outflow velocities (\u00a72.4.2). One of the QSOs in\nour sample (3C 351.0) does reveal a complex, multicomponent O VI system with 13 O VI components spread\nover \u2248 2800 km s\u22121 at zabs \u2248 zQSO (Yuan et al. 2002).\nThis complex proximate absorber, which does show evidence of partial covering of the QSO continuum and\nbroad emission line sources (see Yuan et al.), is probably\nbest described as a mini-BAL. Apart from this particular system, we do not find any evidence of high-speed\nQSO outflows in our sample. We do see some clear differences between O VI absorbers at vdispl < 5000 km s\u22121\nand those at vdispl \u226b 5000 km s\u22121 : (1) dN/dz for O VI\nincreases substantially as zabs approaches zQSO , (2) we\nfind a marginal indication, based on the proximate absorber b\u2212value distribution, that proximate O VI lines\ntend to be narrower than the intervening O VI lines, and\n(3) \u224840 % of the proximate O VI systems have much\nlower H I/O VI ratios than the intervening systems.\nThe lower H I/O VI ratios in proximate systems could\nbe due to ionization effects (due to proximity to the\nbright backgound QSO), higher metallicity, or both. Figure 37 shows the predicted N (O VI) from photoionized\nmodels with log N (H I) = 13.0, [M/H] = \u22121.0, and two\ndifferent ionizing radiation fields, the Mathews & Ferland (1987) approximate description of an AGN spectral energy distribution and the Haardt & Madau (1996)\nUV background that we have used previously. We see\nthat the Mathews & Ferland AGN SED does increase the\namount of O VI predicted from a low-N (H I) cloud com-\n\n14.5\nlog [N(O VI) (cm\u22122)]\n\nabsorbers should arise in relatively cool gas, but it should\nbe noted that other simulations have also indicated that\nsome fraction of the O VI absorption occurs in predominantly photoionized gas (e.g., Cen et al. 2001; Fang &\nBryan 2001; Chen et al. 2003). In the simulations, how\ndo the O VI and H I profiles compare in photoionized\nregions? Conversely, what are the characteristics of the\nO VI and H I profiles in the warm-hot, shocked regions in\nthe simulations? For example, is the WHIM expected to\nbe typically found in close proximity to cooler gas thereby\nresulting in complex, multiphase profiles? Another question is whether the similarity of many of the observed\nO VI and H I profiles could arise in multiphase gas in\nwhich the O VI traces a hotter phase and the H I arises\nin cooler gas. A wind-blown bubble-like feature might\nhave hot O VI in an interface just inside the bubble edge\nand cool H I around the outer periphery; could this configuration result in well-matched O VI and H I profiles?\nIntuitively, differences in factors such as temperature and\nturbulence in the hot vs. the cold gas would be expected\nto impart different kinematic characteristics to the O VI\nand H I in this situation. Detailed assessments of the\nO VI and H I characteristics in theoretical simulations\nwould provide valuable insight for interpreation of the\nO VI absorbers.\n\n14.0\n\n45\n\nProximate system models\nlog N(H I) = 13.0\n[M/H] = \u22121.0\nAGN SED\nQSO bkg.\n\n\u2191\n\n13.5\n13.0\n12.5\n12.0\n\u22120.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\nlog Ionization Parameter\n\n1.0\n\nFig. 37.- Photoionization models with low H I column densities and moderately low metallicities for two ionizing radiation\nfields: the approximate description of the spectral energy distribution of an AGN from Mathews & Ferland (1987) [solid line]\nand the QSO background from Haardt & Madau (2006) [dashed\nline]. These models have a fixed H I column density (log N (H I)\n= 13.0) and metallicity (Z = 0.1Z\u2299 ), and with these parameters,\nthe predicted O VI column is shown as a function of the ionization parameter. The open squares show the measured N (O VI)\nvalues for the eight proximate system components with log N (H I)\n. 13.1 (one of the components is shown as a lower limit because\nthe O VI column could be underestimated due to an uncertain\namount of line saturation). The open squares are arbitrarily plotted at the ionization parameter where N (O VI) peaks in the AGN\nSED model. Detections of other metals (apart from O VI) are required to constrain the appropriate ionization parameter for each\nobserved absorber. However, moving away from the peak ionization parameter increases the discrepancy between the observed and\npredicted O VI columns, which reinforces the conclusion that these\nabsorbers require [M/H] \u226b \u22121.0.\n\npared to the UV background expected in the intervening\nIGM. However, we also show the measured N (O VI) that\nwe find in eight proximate absorber components that\nhave log N (H I) . 13.0, and we see that even the Mathews & Ferland model falls short of the observed columns,\nin some cases by more than an order of magnitude. Realizing that most of the eight cases in Figure 37 provide only upper limits on N (H I), and realizing that the\nionization parameter does not necessarily have the value\nthat maximizes the predicted N (O VI), we conclude that\nthese proximate absorbers require metallicities that are\nmuch greater than 0.1 Z\u2299 .\nThus, for the subset of the proximate absorbers shown\nin Figure 37, we find possible evidence of feedback in\nthe form of metal enrichment. However, the location of\nthese absorbing clouds is not clear. If these clouds are\nlocated deep inside the QSO host galaxy close to the\nQSO central engine, then they would not have significant effects on galaxy evolution. Also, the high metallicities could simply reflect the high metallicity of a host\ngalaxy that is old enough to have significantly enriched\nits ISM. The distance of the proximate absorbers away\nfrom the QSO is a key uncertain parameter that limits\ninterpretation of these systems. Some previous studies\nhave presented evidence that proximate absorption systems can be several tens to several hundred kpc away\nfrom the QSO flux source (e.g., Morris et al. 1986; Tripp\net al. 1996; Hamann et al. 2001), but other studies\nhave revealed characteristics such as temporal variability\nand partial covering that place proximate absorbers quite\n\n\f46\n\nTripp et al.\n\nclose (d . 1 kpc) to the central engine (e.g., Hamann et\nal. 1997b; Narayanan et al. 2004).\n5.2.2. Future Studies of Proximate Absorbers\n\nSeveral future observations would help to elucidate the\nnature and significance of the proximate absorbers. Monitoring the absorbers for temporal variability would be\nvaluable to constrain the plasma densities and locations\nof the proximate systems. Searches for evidence of partial\ncovering would be similarly useful, but this would likely\nrequire high S/N spectra. However, high S/N observations would also be valuable for detecting weak H I and\nother metal lines, which would enable metallicity and\nphysical conditions estimates for specific systems. Finally, thanks to the huge number of quasars discovered\nby large-scale surveys such as SDSS, it has become possible use background QSOs to probe absorption from gas\naffiliated with a foreground, lower-redshift QSO (Bowen\net al. 2006; Hennawi et al. 2006). These QSOs behind\nQSOs are found at various impact parameters, and in\nprinciple, they can be used to test whether proximate\nabsorber properties depend on impact parameter and\nwhether sight lines directly to the QSOs have special\ncharacteristics. For example, are the low H I/O VI ratios\nalso observed in sight lines to QSOs behind QSOs, or are\nthese low ratios only found when the foreground QSO\nitself is the background light source? Observations of\nO VI in QSO-QSO pairs could provide insight, especially\nat low redshifts where O VI is not badly contaminated\nby Ly\u03b1 forest lines.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nTo study the physical conditions, chemical enrichment,\nand baryonic content of the low-redshift integalactic\nmedium, we have surveyed the O VI absorption lines of\n16 low\u2212z QSOs using high-resolution ultraviolet spectra.\nWe primarily use data obtained with the STIS E140M\nechelle mode at 7 km s\u22121 spectral resolution (FWHM),\nand we supplement the STIS sample with FUSE data\nrecorded at 20\u221225 km s\u22121 resolution. Signal-to-noise ratios (per resolution element) range from 10 to 33 at \u03bbobs\n= 1300 \u00c5. We have examined the properties of the intervening O VI absorbers with zabs \u226a zQSO as well as the\nproximate O VI absorption systems with zabs \u2248 zQSO .\nFrom these data, we obtain the following results:\n1. We identify 51 intervening (zabs \u226a zQSO ) O VI systems comprised of 77 individual components, and\nwe find 14 proximate systems (within 5000 km s\u22121\nof zQSO ) containing 34 components. The intervening absorber redshifts range from zabs = 0.00210\nto 0.49508, and the median redshift is 0.213. For\nproximate systems, the system redshifts range from\n0.15779 to 0.49246, and the median redshift is\n0.267.\n2. We report redshifts, column densities, b\u2212values,\nand component velocity centroids for all O VI and\nH I lines in the identified O VI absorbers. We\nalso present comparisons of the apparent column\ndensity profiles of O VI and H I in these systems.\nSome of the absorbers are characterized by complex kinematics, with comparison of the O VI and\nH I profiles revealing significantly different velocity centroids, line widths, and different numbers of\n\ncomponents within a system. However, some of\nthe systems are characterized by relatively simple\nprofile structures, and moreover, in these cases the\nO VI and H I profiles are often well-aligned in velocity.\n3. Based on the kinematics and ionization properties of the absorption profiles, we classify the absorbers as simple (likely single-phase) systems or\ncomplex/multiphase systems. The multiphase systems have a substantially greater spread in the distribution of velocity offsets between the H I and\nO VI centroids (i.e., vH I \u2212 vO VI ). Transitions of\nlow-ionization metals are detected in some of the\nmultiphase systems, and in some cases, comparison of the low-ion and high-ion component structure shows that the low ions and high ions arise in\nseparate gas phases.\n4. For intervening systems (components) with restframe equivalent width Wr > 30 m\u00c5, the number of\nO VI absorbers per unit redshift dN/dz = 15.6+2.9\n\u22122.4\n+1.0\n(21.0+3.2\n),\nand\nthis\ndecreases\nto\ndN/dz\n=\n0.9\n\u22122.8\n\u22120.5\n(0.3+0.7\n\u22120.3 ) for Wr > 300 m\u00c5. We also present the\ndifferential dN/dz distributions of the O VI components. We compare the O VI dN/dz measurements\nfor intervening absorbers to predictions from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and we find\nreasonable agreement.\n5. The number of O VI absorbers increases dramatically as zabs approaches zQSO ; we find that dN/dz\nis \u2248 3\u221210 times higher within 2500 km s\u22121 of zQSO .\nWhile there are known low\u2212z proximate absorbers\nwith vdispl > 2500 km s\u22121 that originate in highvelocity QSO outflows, we find little clear evidence\nof such AGN high-velocity outflows in this sample.\nThe radio-loud QSO 3C 351.0 has a mini-BAL outflow (Yuan et al. 2002), but apart from this sight\nline, most of the proximate/intrinsic absorbers are\nfound within 2500 km s\u22121 of zQSO .\n6. The column density and differential dN/dz distributions of the intervening and proximate O VI absorbers are statistically indistinguishable, but we\nfind a weak indication that the proximate absorbers\nare narrower (lower b\u2212values).\n7. A more distinguishing feature of the proximate absorbers is that a subset of these systems has very\nlow H I/O VI ratios. Many well-detected proximate O VI systems have little or no affiliated H I\nwith log N (H I) < 13.0, which is much lower than\nthe typical N (H I) detected in intervening O VI absorbers. We show that this could be partially due\nto ionization effects, but the proximate absorbers\nmust also have higher metallicities than intervening\nsystems.\n8. In the intervening systems, we use the well-aligned\nO VI and H I components to derive constraints\non the plasma temperatures and the non-thermal\nbroadening components of the absorbers. In many\ncases, the good alignment and similar shapes of\nthe O VI and H I lines suggests that the O VI\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\nand H I absorption arises in the same gas. Assuming that this is the case (but see summary point\n11 below), our analysis shows that the well-aligned\ncomponents are dominated by surprisingly cool gas\nclouds: 62% of the aligned components indicate\ntemperatures less than 105 K. Considering the entire robust intervening sample (including the O VI\ncomponents that are not aligned with H I components), we place a lower limit on the cold fraction:\nwe find that >30% of the intervening components\nhave log T < 5.0. These components are colder\nthan expected in the canonical WHIM models computed by hydrodynamic simulations but are consistent with temperatures predicted for O VI absorbers in some of the more recent simulations (e.g.,\nKang et al. 2005; Richter et al. 2006). However,\nwe also note that 26% of the well-aligned components (14% of the entire robust sample) imply log\nT > 4.6, which is hotter than expected in generic\nphotoionization models.\n9. Motivated by the relatively cool temperatures implied by the O VI and H I line widths, we compare\nphotoionization and nonequilibrium (radiatively\ncooling) collisional ionization models to the observations. We find that most of these cool intervening\nO VI absorbers are inconsistent with available equilibrium and non-equilibrium collisional ionization\nmodels but are easily understood if photoionized.\nPhotoionization can naturally explain the observed\ncorrelation between log [N (H I)/N (O VI)] and log\nN (O VI) as long as there is variability in the intensity and shape of the ionizing UV background and\nthe IGM metallicity.\n10. Noting that roughly half of the intervening systems\nshow evidence of multiple physical phases, often\nwith complex multicomponent profile structure, we\nshow that these multiphase systems can accommodate the warm-hot gas. However, while the data\nare consistent with the presence of hot gas, hot gas\nis not uniquely required by the data. In these complex systems, compelling identification of gas with\nT > 105 K requires high spectral resolution and\nhigh signal-to-noise data. Ancillary species such as\nO III, O IV, O V, C IV, and Ne VIII also provide\nvaluable insight on the physical conditions of these\nsystems.\n11. We show that the current data cannot rule out the\npossibility that there are broad Ly\u03b1 components\nhidden in the noise that are associated with O VI\nlines, but this requires that the O VI absorber temperatures are close to the temperature at which\nO VI peaks in abundance in CIE or that the metallicities are high (significantly lower or higher temperatures, or lower metallicities, would lead to detectable broad Ly\u03b1 components that are not consistent with the data). This hypothesis also requires\nthat the hot O VI phase is almost always affiliated\nwith a cooler low-ionization phase that is required\nto produce the bulk of the narrow H I absorption.\nThis situation could occur if the O VI originates\nin interfaces on the low-ionization cloud surfaces.\n\n47\n\nCurrent interface models have difficulting producing enough O VI to match the QSO absorbers, but\na variety of observations suggest that the physical\nprocesses in interfaces are not yet adequately understood.\n\nWe appreciate helpful discussions with Bart Wakker,\nJason X.

In this system, H I Ly\u03b2 is mildly blended with an unrelated line. However, most of\nthe Ly\u03b2 profile is free from the blend, and the unblended portion of Ly\u03b2 provides useful contraints and was included\nin the fit. Hot pixels are present in the STIS spectrum on both the blue and red sides of the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line (see\nFigure 5). The O VI identification is secure because the \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 profiles agree well in the regions that\nare not affected by hot pixels. However, the regions affected by hot pixels were excluded from the fit.\n(2.) 3C 249.1, zabs = 0.30811. Both lines of the O VI doublet are detected at high significance at this redshift (see\nFigure 7). However, the O VI profiles are strongly saturated in the component at v = 0 km s\u22121 . In addition, hot\npixels are present in the core of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line. Consequently, the line parameters are highly uncertain for the\nv = 0 km s\u22121 component.\n(3.) 3C 249.1, zabs = 0.31364. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line at this redshift is only detected at the 1.9\u03c3 level. However,\nthe strength of the 2\u03c3 feature is in good agreement with the expected strength implied by the well-detected O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 line. In addition, the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is well-aligned with the H I Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and Ly\u03b3 lines detected at\nthis redshift. The metal profiles marginally suggest the presence of a second component, but better S/N is required\nto verify and measure the second component.\n(4.) 3C 273.0, zabs = 0.00334. The blue side of the Ly\u03b2 profile is blended with a Galactic H2 absorption line (see\nSembach et al. 2001). Consequently, only the red side of the Ly\u03b2 line (which is free from blending) was used to\nconstrain the fit. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is severely blended with Galactic H2 absorption, so only the O VI \u03bb1031.93\nline can be measured. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is affiliated with a well-detected H I absorber at the same redshift\n(Sembach et al. 2001). This absorber clearly shows evidence of multiple components in the H I Ly\u03b1 profile (see\nFigure 33). The O VI profile, on the other hand, only shows one clear component. However, the O VI line is broad\nand shallow, and the breadth of the O VI feature is consistent with the velocity range spanned by the H I absorption.\nThe degree of velocity-centroid alignment of the O VI with H I is ambiguous: the O VI is aligned, to within the 2\u03c3\nuncertainty, with both H I components derived from profile fitting in Table 3. Following the conventions outlined in\n\u00a72.3.2, we assign the O VI to the broader H I component. In addition, as discussed in \u00a74.2, the breadth of the H I\ncomponent at v = \u22128 km s\u22121 depends critically on the number of components assumed for the fit.\n(5.) 3C 273.0, zabs = 0.12003. At this redshift, the O VI doublet is covered by both the STIS and the FUSE\nspectrum of 3C 273.0. Both lines of the O VI doublet are clearly detected in the FUSE spectrum of 3C 273.0 (see\nFigure 3 in Tripp et al. 2006b). In the STIS spectrum, the O VI lines are located in a region of rapidly decreasing\nsignal-to-noise. The STIS spectrum shows the O VI 1037.62 line at 4.0\u03c3 significance, but the significance of the 1031.93\nline is < 2\u03c3. Consequently, we base our fit on the FUSE data, but we note that fitting the STIS data yeilds consistent\n(but noisier) results.\n(6.) 3C 273.0, zabs = 0.15779. The O VI 1031.93 line is detected at 4.5\u03c3 significance, but the weaker O VI \u03bb1037.62\nline is not detected. The O VI identification is favored based on the precise alignment of O VI \u03bb1031.93 candidate\nwith an H I Ly\u03b1 line at the same redshift (see Figure 18).\n(7.) 3C 351.0, zabs = 0.21811. Figure 38 shows the H I Ly\u03b1 and O VI lines that we detect in this system; the upper\npanels show the absorption profiles and the lowest panel compares the O VI Na (v) profiles. The O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62\nlines are detected at the 5.5\u03c3 and 3.7\u03c3 levels, respectively, and the Na (v) profiles are in good agreement. The O VI\nprofiles are broad and shallow and hence are sensitive to continuum placement. Thom & Chen (2008) do not agree\nwith this system identification; the most likely source of this discrepancy is continuum placement, but differences in\ndata reduction procedures could play a role. Higher S/N observations with COS would be valuable for confirmation of\nbroad and shallow lines such as these. Similar component structure is evident in the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and O VI \u03bb1037.62\nprofiles, and the similarity of the component structure favors a multicomponent fit. However, the O VI profiles are\nmoderately noisy. We flag these measurements with a colon because while three components are suggested by the\nO VI data, better S/N is needed to robustly establish that three components are present. If we fit the O VI lines with\na single component instead of the three-component fit listed in Table 3, we obtain b(O VI) = 82\u00b113 km s\u22121 and log\nN (O VI) = 14.06\u00b10.05 for the single line.\n(8.) 3C 351.0, zabs = 0.22111. An archival FUSE spectrum of 3C 351.0 shows that this is an optically-thick Lyman\nlimit absorber with N (H I) > 1017 cm\u22122 . The Ly\u03b1 profile is strongly saturated but shows complex structure at\nthe edges of the profile. This structure could be partly due to damping wings, but this profile structure cannot be\nunambigously attributed to damping wings. Consequently, the H I column density is highly uncertain. The O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 line is severely blended with the Galactic Si II \u03bb1260.42 line, and consequently \u03bb1031.93 cannot be measured.\nHowever, many metal lines are detected at the redshift of this strong Lyman limit system including transitions of C II,\nN II, Si II, Si III, and Si IV. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is identified based on its alignment with the other metals at this\nredshift. All available H I lines are strongly saturated at the velocities of the metal lines, so the degree of alignment of\nthe O VI and H I lines cannot be evaluated. However, analysis of the low- and high-ionization metals lines indicates\nthe presence of multiple phases, so this system is classified as a complex absorber.\n(9.) H1821+643, zabs = 0.02438. H I Ly\u03b2 is mildly blended with a Galactic H2 absorption line (see Sembach et al.\n2008), but the Ly\u03b2 line is mostly free from the blend. The blended portion of Ly\u03b2 was excluded from the fit. O VI\n\u03bb1037.62 is lost in a blend with Milky Way Fe II and H2 absorption. The O VI identification is based on the precise\nalignment of O VI \u03bb1031.93 with Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 lines at the same redshift.\n\n\f50\n\nTripp et al.\n\n(10.) H1821+643, zabs = 0.12143. Thom & Chen (2008) challenge this O VI identification, noting that \"there is\nstrong absorption at the O VI 1037 position, but no O VI 1031, which should be easily detected, given the strength\nof the weaker supposed O VI 1037 line.\" However, as discussed in detail by Tripp et al. (2001), the O VI \u03bb1037.62\nline is significantly blended with strong H I Ly\u03b4 absorption from the absorber at zabs = 0.22496 (see Figure 2 in Tripp\net al. 2001), and it appears that Thom & Chen (2008) have not taken this serious blend into account. Moreover,\nThom & Chen base their conclusions on the STIS data only, which have S/N . 3 per pixel in this wavelength range,\nwhereas the FUSE observations we used have S/N & 13 per pixel here. When the FUSE data are employed and the\nLy\u03b4 blend is accounted for, we find compelling evidence supporting this system. Because of the strong blend, our O VI\nmeasurements are based on the 1031.93 line alone. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected at the 6.9\u03c3 level in our data.\nWhile the blend hampers confirmation based on the 1037.63 line, we note that there are no other clear identifications\nfor the 6.9\u03c3 line at the 1031.93 wavelength. This is not an H I Ly\u03b1 line because the redshift places the line blueward\nof the Ly\u03b1 region, nor is it a higher Lyman series H I line because corresponding strong H I lines would be obvious in\nthe STIS spectrum but are not evident.\n(11.) H1821+643, zabs = 0.21331. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is blended with weak, high-velocity S II \u03bb1259.52\nabsorption from Milky Way gas (see Savage et al. 1995 and Tripp et al. 2003 for information about the Galactic\nhigh-velocity gas toward H1821+643). Comparison of the Galactic S II \u03bb1259.52 and S II \u03bb1253.81 lines shows that\nthere is excess optical depth in the 1259.52 \u00c5 line, and the excess is consistent with the expected contribution from\nthe O VI \u03bb1037.62 line at zabs = 0.21331 (based on the strength of the unblended O VI \u03bb1031.93 line), which supports\nthe identification of O VI at this redshift. In addition, the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is aligned with H I Ly\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 lines\nat the same zabs .\n(12.) HE0226-4110, zabs = 0.01747. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is blended with O IV \u03bb787.71 at zabs = 0.34035 (see\nLehner et al. 2006 and Figure 29). The O VI identification is favored based on the precise alignment of O VI \u03bb1031.93\ncandidate with an H I Ly\u03b1 line at the same redshift. We note that the comparison of the Na profiles in Figure 18 does\nnot show the absorption in the wings of the Ly\u03b1 line very clearly; Figure 29 more clearly shows how the H I line is\nslightly broader than the O VI lines.\n(13.) HE0226-4110, zabs = 0.20701. Detailed analysis of this system has been presented by Savage et al. (2005).\nThe H I Ly\u03b3 line is recorded in both the STIS spectrum and the FUSE spectrum of HE0226-4110. The apparent\ncomponent structure in the STIS recording of the Ly\u03b3 line is incompatible with the FUSE recording of Ly\u03b3 and with\nthe other (higher) Lyman series lines (see Savage et al. 2005), and the STIS Ly\u03b3 line was excluded from the fit.\n(14.) HE0226-4110, zabs = 0.35525. A weaker line offset by +40 km s\u22121 is present next to the main component\nthat is clearly detected in the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and O VI \u03bb1037.62 profiles at this redshift. The +40 km s\u22121 feature does\nnot appear to be O VI because it is not confirmed by the \u03bb1037.62 line. However, the +40 km s\u22121 feature would be\nrelatively weak in the \u03bb1037.62 transition, and it could be hidden by noise. Following Lehner et al. (2006), we do not\ninclude the 40 km s\u22121 component in the O VI measurements; higher S/N data are needed to establish the identity of\nthis feature.\n(15.) HE0226-4110, zabs = 0.42670. At this redshift, the Ly\u03b1 is redshifted beyond the long-wavelength cutoff of\nour STIS spectrum, and Ly\u03b2 line is not detected. The O VI identification is based on the good agreement of the O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 profiles (see Lehner et al. 2006). The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is partially affected by hot pixels\nthat were excluded from the fit. We note that identification of this system depends critically on the STIS warm/hot\npixel correction algorithm. If we turn off the hot-pixel repair algorithm, we find that the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is largely\nfilled in by warm pixels. It is important to obtain future observations of this system with COS in order to test the\nreliability of the identification and to expand the utility of this system with additional information (e.g., better H I\nabsorption constraints).\n(16.) HE0226-4110, zabs = 0.49246. This complex, multispecies system has been analyzed in detail by Ganguly\net al. (2006). The O VI component at v = 0 km s\u22121 is uncertain due to substantial saturation. The O VI \u03bb1037.62\nline is partially blended with Galactic C IV (see Fox et al. 2005), but the distinctive component structure seen in the\nO VI \u03bb1031.93 profile can be clearly recognized in the in the \u03bb1037.62 profile as well (see Ganguly et al. 2006), so the\nidentification is secure, and the weaker O VI components are well-constrained by the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line.\n(17.) HS0624+6907, zabs = 0.33979. H I Ly\u03b2 is mildly blended with an unrelated line. However, most of the Ly\u03b2\nprofile is free from the blend, and the unblended portion of Ly\u03b2 was included in the fit. As shown in the left panel\nof Figure 39, hox pixel features are present within the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line and at the red edge of the O VI \u03bb1037.62\nprofile. Fortunately, in this case the QSO was observed on two different dates (in January 2002 and February 2002,\nsee Table 1), and the position of the spectrum on the detector was shifted between these two dates. Inspection of the\ndata reveals that the hot pixel features are only present in the February 2002 data. As shown in the right panel of\nFigure 39, by masking and rejecting the affected hot pixels in the February data, we can suppress this problem with\na minimal loss of the signal-to-noise.\n(18.) HS0624+6907, zabs = 0.37053. In this proximate absorber, H I Ly\u03b1 is not detected despite good signal-tonoise (see Figure 7). As shown in Figure 7, the O VI identification is quite secure; both lines of the O VI doublet show\nmultiple components and are in excellent agreement.\n(19.) PG0953+415, zabs = 0.06807. We have carried out extensive investigations of this absorber in previous papers\n(Savage et al. 2002; Tripp et al. 2006). Comparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 lines indicates moderate\nsaturation, and application of the method of Jenkins (1996) indicates that N (O VI) could be 0.25 dex higher.\n(20.)

The panels show\nthe regions of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line (top panels) and the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line (bottom panels) at zabs = 0.33979 in the spectrum of\nHS0624+6907. The left panels show the line profiles without any hot pixel alleviation; hot pixels are clearly evident near both profiles.\nThe HS0624+6907 observations were recorded in Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2002 (see Table 1), and the spectrum position on the detector was\nshifted between the two dates. Consequently, the hot pixels are only present in the February data and can be masked and rejected from\nthe final coadded spectrum as shown at right.\n\nThe blended part of the Ly\u03b2 line was not used in the fit. However, the Ly\u03b1 line has a complex profile with many\ncomponents (see Tripp & Savage 2000), and the unblended portion of the Ly\u03b2 line provides useful constraints for the\nfit.\n(21.) PG0953+415, zabs = 0.22974. In this proximate absorber of PG0953+415, H I Ly\u03b1 is not detected despite\ngood signal-to-noise. The O VI identification is based on the good agreement of the O VI lines over a large portion\nof both profiles: the \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 profiles agree well over \u2248 20 pixels between v = \u221230 km s\u22121 and v = 40\nkm s\u22121 . However, the O VI profiles are discrepant at v < \u221230 km s\u22121 . While this discrepancy has the appearance\nof a hot pixel feature, comparison of the data from 1998 December 4 and 1998 December 11 shows the same profile\nstructure. The location of the spectrum on the detector was shifted between 1998 December 4 and 1998 December 11,\nso this discrepancy cannot be due to hot pixels. We conclude that the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is blended with an unrelated\nLy\u03b1 line on the blue side of the profile. This part of the \u03bb1031.93 profile was excluded from the Voigt profile fit.\n(22.) PG0953+415, zabs = 0.23351. A Ly\u03b4 line with approximately correct strength is detected at this redshift but\nwas not used in the fit due to blending with Ly\u03b2 from the complex, multicomponent absorber at zabs = 0.14231.\n(23.) PG1116+215, zabs = 0.05927. Both lines of the O VI doublet are detected and in excellent agreement at v = 0\nkm s\u22121 (see Figure 29). The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is also detected at v = \u221284 km s\u22121 , but the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is not\nsignificantly detected at that velocity. A small portion of the detected O VI \u03bb1031.93 component at v = \u221284 km s\u22121 is\nblended with Galactic H2 (see Sembach et al. 2004). The v = \u221284 km s\u22121 component is also identified as O VI based\non the good agreement of the O VI and H I Ly\u03b1 line shapes at v = \u221284 km s\u22121 (not including the portion blended\nwith H2 , which was also excluded from the fit), as shown in Figure 18.\n(24.) PG1116+215, zabs = 0.13849. The O VI doublet at this redshift is detected with both FUSE and STIS (see\nSembach et al. 2004). The fit reported here is based on the STIS data. This system, which has a high H I column\nand is detected in many Lyman series lines, has been analyzed in detail by Sembach et al. (2004). The O VI lines\nare aligned with the H I lines, but analysis of the many low-ionization metal absorption lines detected in this system\nclearly establishes that this is a complex multiphase absorber (see Sembach et al. 2004).\n(25.) PG1116+215, zabs = 0.16553. The H I components at v = \u221212, 143, 170, and 342 km s\u22121 are well-constrained\nby the detected absorption lines. Additional absorption is clearly and significantly detected in other velocity ranges in\n\n\f52\n\nTripp et al.\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nPG1259+593\nzabs = 0.31972\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nPG1216+069\nzabs = 0.26768\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n0\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\nx\n1\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nO VI\nH I Ly\u03b2 (x0.3)\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nx\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n0\n4\n\n0.0\n\n3\n2\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nFig. 40.- Left panels: Continuum-normalized absorption profiles of the H I Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and O VI \u03bb1031.93 lines at zabs = 0.26768 in the\nspectrum of PG1216+069 (upper three panels), and comparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and Ly\u03b2 Na (v) profiles (lowest panel).

Right panels: Absorption\nprofiles of the H I and O VI lines detected at zabs = 0.31972 in the spectrum of PG1259+593. In this stack, the lowest panel compares the\nNa (v) profiles of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 lines. In this figure, the Na (v) profiles are binned to 7 km s\u22121 pixels.\n\nthe Ly\u03b1 profile, e.g., at v \u2248 70 km s\u22121 , and components were added to the fit to account for this additional absorption.\nHowever, these components are not well-constrained due to blending with the adjacent features.\n(26.) PG1116+215, zabs = 0.17340. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected at 5.8\u03c3 significance and is well-aligned with\nan H I line at the same redshift. In addition, the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is detected with the expected wavelength and\nrelative strength at 2.9\u03c3.\n(27.) PG1216+069, zabs = 0.12360. The Ly\u03b1 profile has good signal-to-noise and shows clear inflections and asymmetries that reveal the complicated component structure including at least eight components; four of the components\nare clearly evident in the Ly\u03b2 profile as well (see Figure 4). However, all of the components are either strong and\nsignificantly saturated (in both Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2) or are highly blended with adjacent strong components. Moreover,\nsome of the saturated components show that there are errors in the flux zero level of the Ly\u03b1 line, and the Ly\u03b2 line is\nrelatively noisy. Ly\u03b3 lines are also evident (see Tripp et al. 2005), but the Ly\u03b3 data are too noisy to usefully constrain\nthe fits. The H I component parameters are highly uncertain due to these combined problems. Both lines of the O VI\ndoublet are strong and are clearly detected with component structure similar to the Ly\u03b2 components. The apparent\ncolumn density profiles of the O VI doublet are in good agreement (see Figure 4), which suggests that the O VI lines\nare not badly saturated. However, the O VI profiles are also relatively noisy.\n(28.) PG1216+069, zabs = 0.26768. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line cannot be measured because it is lost in a blend with\na strongly saturated H I Ly\u03b2 absorption line from zabs = 0.28189. As shown in Figure 40, the O VI identification at\nzabs = 0.26768 is based on the alignment of O VI \u03bb1031.93 with Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 at the same redshift. At this redshift,\ninitial inspection indentified a candidate C III \u03bb977.02 line that is somewhat blended with N V \u03bb1238.82 absorption\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n53\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n1\nPG1444+407\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nPKS0312-770\nzabs = 0.15890\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n\nzabs = 0.22032\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nNormalized Flux\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1.5\n\nxx\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\nx\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n4\n\n0.0\n\n3\n2\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\nxx\n\nx\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0.0\n\n6\n4\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nFig. 41.- Left panels: Continuum-normalized absorption profiles of the H I Ly\u03b1 and O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62 lines at zabs = 0.22032\nin the spectrum of PG1444+407 (upper three panels), and comparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 Na (v) profiles (lowest panel).\nVoigt-profile fits (see Table 3) are overplotted with smooth lines. Unrelated lines are marked with an 'x'. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is blended\nwith Milky Way S II \u03bb1259.52 absorption, but excess absorption is present in the blend that cannot be attributed to S II. As shown, the\nexcess absorption is consistent with the expected strength of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line. Right panels: The same data for the O VI absorber\nat zabs = 0.15890 in the spectrum of PKS0312-770. In this figure, the Na (v) profiles are binned to 7 km s\u22121 pixels.\n\nfrom the Milky Way. The C III candidate cannot be a second component of Galactic N V absorption because it is not\nevident in the profile of the other line of the N V doublet. However, closer inspection reveals that this line is not C III\nbut rather is the H I Ly\u03b3 line from the strong H I system at zabs = 0.27353, so we can only place an upper limit on\nC III absorption at this redshift.\n(29.) PG1259+593, zabs = 0.04637. Only the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected at this redshift (O VI \u03bb1037.62 is\nredshifted into a relatively noisy region of the FUSE spectrum that is only recorded by the SiC channels). Nevertheless,\nthe identification is secure because the O VI \u03bb1031.93 profile has a distinctive two-component structure that matches\nthe component structure seen in the C III and C IV lines detected at the same redshift. An unrelated O IV \u03bb787.71\nline is located near the Ly\u03b3 profile; the region affected by the O IV feature was excluded from the fit.\n(30.) PG1259+593, zabs = 0.21949. Several components due to Galactic S II \u03bb1250.58 are located on the blue side\nof the Ly\u03b2 line (see Richter et al. 2004); the velocity range affected by the Milky Way S II absorption was excluded\nfrom the fit.\n(31.) PG1259+593, zabs = 0.31972. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is quite weak and mildly blended with high-velocity\nNi II absorption from the Milky Way (see Richter et al. 2004). As shown in the right panels of Figure 40, the O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 line is clearly detected, and an absorption feature with the right relative strength (compared to \u03bb1031.93) is\npresent at the expected wavelength of O VI \u03bb1037.62, but because it is weak and blended with Galactic Ni II, our fit\nis based on the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line only.\n(32.) PG1444+407, zabs = 0.22032. The H I Ly\u03b1 and O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62 lines for this absorption system\nare shown in the left panels of Figure 41. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line at zabs = 0.22032 is blended with the Galactic S II\n\u03bb1259.52 line. However, comparison of the Galactic S II 1253.81 and S II \u03bb1259.52 profiles shows a clear and significant\nexcess of absorption at the expected velocity of O VI \u03bb1031.93 at zabs = 0.22032. Moreover, the excess absorption has\nprecisely the expected strength compared to the (unblended) O VI \u03bb 1037.62 line, as can be seen in the comparison of\nthe O VI Na (v) profiles shown in Figure 41. Only the unblended portion of O VI \u03bb1031.93 was included in the fit.\n(33.) PG1444+407, zabs = 0.26738. The Ly\u03b2 line is slightly blended with an unrelated weak line; the region\naffected by the blend was excluded from the fit. More importantly, the Ly\u03b1 line is located at the peak of the broad\nLy\u03b1 emission line, and this introduces significant continuum placement uncertainty. We note that a broad and shallow\n\n\f54\n\nTripp et al.\n\nfeature is located just blueward of the Ly\u03b1 line. This feature could be due to additional weak H I absorption, but its\nsignificance is highly dependent on the uncertain continuum placement. Consequently, we did not include the broad,\nshallow feature in the fit.\n(34.) PHL1811, zabs = 0.07765. Only the stronger O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected at > 3\u03c3 significance. However,\nmany metals are detected at this redshift including C II \u03bb1334.53, Si II \u03bb1260.42, C III \u03bb977.02, C IV \u03bb1548.20,\n(marginal) Si IV \u03bb1393.76, and several H I Lyman series lines. The strongest C IV component shows a \u2248 \u221225 km s\u22121\noffset from the lower ionization metals, but the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is aligned with the C IV \u03bb1548.20 transition.\n(35.) PHL1811, zabs = 0.15786. The Ly\u03b1 profile at zabs = 0.15786 is blended with O I \u03bb1302.17 absorption from\nthe Lyman-limit system at zabs = 0.08092 (see Jenkins et al. 2005 and Figure 35). The narrow core in this blend is\npredominantly due to the Lyman-limit O I line. However, close inspection of this profile (see Figure 35) reveals weak\ncomponent absorption straddling the narrow core on the short- and long-wavelength sides. We cannot corroborate\nthat the weaker components are also O I; similar component structure is not clearly evident in the other profiles of\nlow-ionization metals in this Lyman-limit absorber, which suggests that these weaker components could be unrelated\nto the O I and could be Ly\u03b1 at zabs = 0.15786. However, better S/N data are needed to reliably determine the origin\nof the weak components and to accurately deblend and measure their parameters, so we flag this absorption with a\ncolon in Table 3 to reflect the substantial uncertainty of this Ly\u03b1 case.\n(36.) PHL1811, zabs = 0.17650. At this redshift, O VI \u03bb1031.93 falls in the saturated core of the Milky Way damped\nLy\u03b1 line. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is identified based on its alignment with multiple Lyman series lines, and this is\nsupported by the detection of C III \u03bb977.02 and Si III \u03bb1206.5 in this absorber. However, we note that the O VI is\noffset by \u223c \u221225 km s\u22121 compared to the C III and Si III lines.\n(37.) PKS0312-770, zabs = 0.15890. O VI \u03bb1031.93 is detected at 5.6\u03c3 significance, and the corresponding O VI\n\u03bb1037.62 line is also detected, but only at 2.4\u03c3 significance. As shown in Figure 41, the Na (v) profiles of the two\nlines of the O VI doublet are in good agreement, and the marginal detection of the \u03bb1037.62 line supports the O VI\nidentification. The O VI identification is also supported by the precise alignment of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line with H I\nLy\u03b1 at the same redshift.\n(38.) PKS0312-770, zabs = 0.19827. O VI \u03bb1031.93 is detected at 4.7\u03c3 significance, but the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is\nnot significantly detected in the data at full resolution. However, as shown in the left panels of Figure 42, if we mildly\nbin the data to 7 km s\u22121 pixels to improve the S/N, we find a feature in the spectrum at the expected wavelength of\nthe \u03bb1037.62 line that is fully consistent with the detected O VI \u03bb1031.93 line (compare the Na (v) profiles shown in\nthe lowest left-hand panel of Figure 42). The O VI identification is bolstered by the close alignment of O VI \u03bb1031.93\nwith Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 at the same redshift (see the left panels in Figure 42).\n(39.) PKS0312-770, zabs = 0.20266. All accessible H I lines in the STIS bandpass (Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, Ly\u03b3) are strong and\nhighly saturated. Moreover, the Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b3 profiles show complex component structure with at least five distinct\ncomponents. Since most of the H I components are black in the line cores, the H I profile parameters are poorly\nconstrained, and we have not attempted to fit the H I lines. Brief inspection of an archival FUSE spectrum reveals\nthat this is an optically thick Lyman limit absorber. While the H I component properties are poorly constrained,\ncomparison of the low- and high-ionization metal lines reveals that this is a complex multiphase system (see \u00a72.4.1 and\nFigure 3). In addition, the individual components are spread over a large velocity range with low- and high-ionization\ncomponents detected at velocities ranging from \u2212204 to +135 km s\u22121 .\n(40.) PKS0405-123, zabs = 0.16692. Many Lyman series lines are available for constraining the H I column density\nat this redshift, and the absence of strong Lyman limit absorption places a firm upper limit on the total H I column\ndensity (Prochaska et al. 2004). Nevertheless, the parameters of the individual H I components are highly uncertain\nin this system. The Lyman series lines clearly require a multicomponent fit, but the close spacing and blending of the\ncomponents causes the component parameter uncertainties to be substantial. Thus, the degree of alignment of the H I\nand O VI components is highly uncertain. Nevertheless, comparison on the low- and high-ionization metal lines shows\nthat this is a complex multiphase case (see Chen & Prochaska 2000).\n(41.) PKS0405-123, zabs = 0.36156. The H I Ly\u03b1 and O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62 absorption profiles and apparent\ncolumn densities are compared in the right-hand stack of Figure 42. The O VI Na (v) profiles are seen to be in\nreasonable agreement. We note that the O VI \u03bb1037.62 profile shows a small excess of absorption on the blue side\ncompared to the \u03bb1031.93 line; this could be due to blending with an unrelated line (several unrelated lines are readily\napparent in the vicinity of \u03bb1037.62), but this could also simply be a noise feature. An inflection is also evident in\nthe Ly\u03b1 profile at the velocity of the O VI lines. It is interesting to note that this system has a relatively high N (H I)\nand is detected in several Lyman series lines, but no O VI absorption is evident at the velocity of the main component\nwhere the strong H I lines are found (see Figure 42). Instead, the O VI is in the wing of the profile near the weak H I\ninflection component. Several other absorbers show similar offsets between the strong main H I absorption component\nand the O VI lines (see Figure 18).\n(42.) PKS0405-123, zabs = 0.36335. The O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is detected at the 4.5\u03c3 level, but O VI \u03bb1037.62\nis measured at only 1.7\u03c3 significance. However, the apparent column density profiles of the two O VI lines agree\nprecisely; the wavelength separation and relative strength of the lines makes the O VI identification compelling. The\ncorresponding H I absorption is relatively weak, and moreover, the H I Ly\u03b1 line is strongly blended with Galactic\nC I and C I* absorption lines from the C I \u03bb1656 multiplet. We can see that H I Ly\u03b1 absorption is present at this\nredshift because the Galactic C I* \u03bb1657.38 line is clearly too strong compared to other C I* lines in the PKS0405-123\nspectrum. However, the H I Ly\u03b1 line is difficult to measure reliably due to this strong blending with Galactic C I*\n\u03bb1657.38.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\ngap\n0.5\n\nPKS0312-770\nzabs = 0.19827\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n55\n\nH I Ly\u03b1\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nH I Ly\u03b2\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nPKS0405-123\nzabs = 36156\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\nNormalized Flux\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\nx\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\n0\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0.0\n\n1\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n0\n4\n\n0.0\n\n3\n2\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n1\n0\n-1\nO VI 1031.93\nLy\u03b1 (x2.00)\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n-400\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\n2\n\n-1\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\n-400\n\n-200\n0\n200\nAbsorber Velocity (km s-1)\n\n400\n\nFig. 42.- Left panels: Continuum-normalized absorption profiles of the H I Ly\u03b1, Ly\u03b2, and O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62 lines at zabs =\n0.19827 in the spectrum of PKS0312-770 (upper four panels), and comparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 Na (v) profiles (lowest\npanel).

In this stack, the lowest two panels show the comparison of the Na (v) profiles of the two lines of the O VI\ndoublet (second panel from bottom) and a comparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and H I Ly\u03b1 Na (v) profiles (lowest panel). Unrelated lines\nare marked with an 'x'. In this figure, the Na (v) profiles are binned to 7 km s\u22121 pixels.\n\n(43.) PKS0405-123, zabs = 0.49501. In this case, the H I Ly\u03b1 line is redshifted beyond the long wavelength cutoff of\nthe STIS spectrum, but Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b3 are detected at the 4.1\u03c3 and 2.0\u03c3 levels, respectively. This absorber is detected\nin a variety of metals (Prochaska et al. 2004), and many of the metal profiles, including the O VI lines, show evidence\nof multiple components. However, it should be noted that there is a discrepancy evident in one of the components\nof the O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93,1037.62 lines. To show this, we compare the apparent column density profiles of the O VI\n\u03bb\u03bb1031.93,1037.62 lines in Figure 43. We also compare the O VI \u03bb1031.93 Na (v) profile to those of C III \u03bb977.02, O IV\n\u03bb787.71, and O V \u03bb629.73 in Figure 43. The O VI The O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 profiles agree well in the stronger\ncomponent at v \u2248 0 km s\u22121 . Looking closely at the strongest component, we can see that the profile is asymmetric\nwith a sharp edge on the red side and a more gradually decreasing apparent column density on the blue side. This\nasymmetry suggests that the main feature is a blend of two components, and this is corroborated by the C III and\nO IV profiles, which also show an extra component on the blue side. A third component is evident at v \u2248 70 km s\u22121\nin the C III and O IV transitions. This component appears to be present in the O V and O VI profiles as well, but\nat a somewhat lower velocity (v = 57 km s\u22121 ). However, there is a 2 \u2212 3 pixel offset between the peak of the O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 and O VI \u03bb1037.62 profiles in the v = 57 km s\u22121 component (see Figure 43), in contrast to the v \u2248 0 km\ns\u22121 component in which the O VI profiles agree well. Initially, this offset appeared to be due to a hot pixel feature\nfalling in the middle of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line, but this cannot be the cause because the PKS0405-123 observations\nwere obtained on two separate occasions (see Table 1), and the spectrum detector position was shifted between the\ntwo visits. The same component structure is evident in the O VI profiles extracted separately from the two visits, so\n\n\f56\n\nTripp et al.\n\n8\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO VI \u03bb1037.62\n\nO VI \u03bb1031.93\nO IV \u03bb787.71\n\nO VI \u03bb1032.93\nC III \u03bb977.02\n(x8.0)\n\nO VI \u03bb1032.93\nO V \u03bb629.73\n\nPKS0405-123\nzabs = 0.49501\n\n6\n\nNa(v) [1012 atoms cm-2 (km/s)-1]\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150 -150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n-1\n\nAbsorber Velocity (km s )\nFig. 43.- Comparison of apparent column density profiles of several metals in the O VI absorption system at zabs = 0.49501 in the\nspectrum of PKS0405-123. Upper left: O VI \u03bb1031.93 (red large circles) vs. O VI \u03bb1037.62 (small black circles). The thick green line shows\nthe O VI profile implied by the Voigt-profile fit listed in Table 3. Upper right: O VI \u03bb1031.93 (red large circles) vs. O IV \u03bb787.71. Lower\nleft: O VI \u03bb1031.93 (red large circles) vs. C III \u03bb977.02. Lower right: O VI \u03bb1031.93 (red large circles) vs. O V \u03bb629.73. Several pixels are\nnot plotted in the core of the O V profile because it is saturated in that region. The O IV and O V profiles are from the FUSE observations\nreported by Prochaska et al. (2004), and the C III and O VI data are measured from the STIS E140M spectrum. Most of these profiles\nshow two weaker components flanking the deepest central component, but as discussed in the text, an offset is apparent between the peak\nof the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 lines in the reddest component.\n\nthis problem is not due to a hot-pixel feature. Apart from this small offset, the Na (v) profiles of the O VI lines at\nv = 57 km s\u22121 appear to be quite consistent: the relative strength and shape of the two lines are in agreement. This\nsuggests that the offset could be caused by an instrumental calibration problem. For example, the STIS geometric\ndistortion can cause offsets of this magnitude if not properly corrected (Walsh et al. 2001; Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz & \u00dabeda\n2004), and some problems with the distortion correction have been noted (Ma\u0131\u0301z-Apell\u00e1niz & \u00dabeda 2004). Evidence\nof wavelength calibration problems have also been noted when comparing lines that should have identical component\nstructure (e.g., Jenkins & Tripp 2001; Tripp et al. 2005). While we have found these problems to be relatively rare,\nthe stability of the STIS gemometric distortion correction has not been studied systematically, and it remains possible\nthat the discrepancy in the v = 57 km s\u22121 component is caused by a calibration problem such as this. Nevertheless,\nwe flag the O VI lines in the v = 57 km s\u22121 component with a colon in Table 3 because of this disagreement, and\nwe treat this component as an insecure identification. With the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, it will be possible\nto reobserve PKS0405-123 to determine if the offset is due to a STIS instrumental problem. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line\nat this redshift falls close to Galactic C IV \u03bb1550.78 (which is the source of the extra absorption evident at v < \u221240\nkm s\u22121 in Figure 43), but from the corresponding Galactic C IV \u03bb1548.20 line, we can see that the Milky Way C IV\nhas little impact on the redshifted O VI \u03bb1037.62 profile. We give this system an uncertain classification due to the\ninsecure identification of the O VI component at v = 57 km s\u22121 and the fact that the Ly\u03b1 profile, which is needed to\ndetect low-N (H I) components, has not been observed at high resolution.\n(44.) PKS1302-102, zabs = 0.19159. The profile fitting code obtains its best fit to the H I lines with a narrow and\ndeep component superimposed on a broad and shallow component at the same velocity. The absorption that requires\nthe broad component could be nearly as well-fit with multiple narrower components, and higher S/N is required to\nbreak this degeneracy. Only O VI \u03bb1031.93 is detected, but the O VI line is precisely aligned with the H I lines, and\nC III \u03bb977.02 and Si III \u03bb1206.50 are also detected with good significance at this redshift.\n(45.) PKS1302-102, zabs = 0.22563. Some parts of the Ly\u03b2 profile are affected by blends; those regions of Ly\u03b2 were\nexcluded from the fit. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 line is also located next to an unrelated strong line.

In addition, we can see from\nthis figure that the O VI lines are aligned with a clearly detected component in the corresponding H I Ly\u03b1 line.\n(47.) TON28, zabs = 0.27340. The H I Ly\u03b1 line is strongly blended with Milky Way C IV \u03bb1548.20. However, the\nH I at this redshift is securely identified and measured based on the well-detected Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b3 lines, and comparison\nof the Galactic C IV \u03bb1548.20 and \u03bb1550.78 apparent column density profiles verifies that substantial extra optical\ndepth (due to the blended Ly\u03b1 line) is present in the Galactic C IV \u03bb1548.20 profile.\nREFERENCES\nAkerman, C.

Target QSO, (2) absorber systemic redshift, which in this paper is defined by the centroid of the strongest component\ndetected in the O VI profiles, (3) species and transition used to measure the integrated equivalent width and column density in columns 4\nand 5, (4) rest-frame equivalent width (measurements of marginally detected lines listed in parentheses), (5) directly integrated apparent\ncolumn density, (6) velocity centroids of each component derived from Voigt-profile fitting (see Table 3), and (7) the spectrograph used\nto\nmake the measurement.\na\nDue to line saturation, direct integration of this line provides only a lower limit on the column density.\nb\nThe corresponding O VI \u03bb1031.93 line is affected by hot pixels in the line core, and this prevents an accurate line saturation assessment.\nIn this table we list the formal column density measurement and uncertainty, but we note that this column could be underestimated due\nto line saturation.\nc\nThis absorber is an optically thick Lyman limit absorber. All available Lyman series lines are strongly saturated and, consequently,\ncannot be used to derive reliable constraints on the H I component structure.\nd\nThe Ly\u03b1 profile has a deep core that approaches close to the zero-flux level. However, the good agreement of the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 apparent\ncolumn density profiles indicates that the Ly\u03b1 is not significantly affected by unresolved saturation.\ne\nAt this redshift, Ly\u03b1 is redshifted beyond the long-wavelength end of the STIS E140M spectrum. Ly\u03b2 is not detected, so no integrated\nquantities are listed in this table for H I.\nf\nThe O VI \u03bb1031.93 profile is affected by hot pixels on the red side of the profile (see Lehner et al. 2006), so integrated quantities must\nbe measured from the O VI \u03bb1037.62 line.\ng\nAt this redshift, Ly\u03b1 is redshifted beyond the long-wavelength end of the STIS E140M spectrum, but several higher Lyman series lines\nare detected (see Ganguly et al. 2006). Here we list the results from direct integration of the Ly\u03b2 profile instead Ly\u03b1.\nh\nO VI \u03bb1037.62 is blended with the Milky Way C IV 1548.20 profile. The O VI \u03bb1037.62 profile is generally consistent with that of O VI\n\u03bb1031.93 (see Ganguly et al. 2006), but the integrated quantities derived from \u03bb1037.62 are significantly contaminated and thus are not\nlisted here.\ni\nBoth the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and O VI \u03bb1037.62 profiles are affected by hot pixel features (see Figure 39). Fortunately, the position of the\nspectrum on the detector was shifted between the 2002 January and 2002 February observations, and the hot pixels are only present in\nthe 2002 February data. As demonstrated in Figure 39, we were able to suppress the hot pixels by rejecting the affected regions in the\n2002 February data.\nj\nThe O VI doublet at this redshift is clearly identified based on the good agreement of the apparent column density profiles. However,\nno H I lines are detected in this absorber despite good S/N in the region of the Ly\u03b1 transition.\nk\nThe O VI \u03bb1031.93 profile is blended with an unrelated Ly\u03b1 line on the blue side of the profile. This portion of the profile was excluded\nfrom the integration. The good agreement of the \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 Na (v) profiles at v > \u221230 km s\u22121 suggests that this blend does\nnot severely affect the \u03bb1031.93 line.\nl\nThe O VI \u03bb1031.93 profile is blended with a Galactic H2 line on the blue side of the profile. The velocity range affected by the H2 blend\nwas excluded from the integration; consequently, the equivalent width and column density from direct integration somewhat underestimate\nthe true quantities.\nm\nAt this redshift, Ly\u03b1 is strongly blended with O I \u03bb1302.17 absorption from the Lyman-limit absorber at zabs = 0.08092 (Jenkins et\nal. 2005). The Ly\u03b1 equivalent width listed in this table is the estimated value after removal of the O I contamination. This correction is\nhighly uncertain, and the remaining Ly\u03b1 absorption (after removal of the O I line) is weak, consequently we consider this measurement\nto be highly uncertain.\nn\nComparison of the O VI \u03bb1031.93 and \u03bb1037.62 apparent column density profiles indicates that the \u03bb1031.93 profile is affected by line\nsaturation. For the weaker \u03bb1037.62 line, we list the O VI column density and its uncertainty obtained from direct integration, but we\nrecognize that this measurement may underestimate the true column due to saturation.\no\nH I Ly\u03b1 absorption is weak but clearly present at this redshift (see further comments in the Appendix). Unfortunately, the Ly\u03b1 line\nparameters cannot be measured due to severe blending with C I* absorption from the Milky Way ISM.\nTABLE 3\nProfile-Fitting Parameters for Intervening and Proximate O

In this paper, we use the centroid of the strongest O VI component to define the systemic redshift of the\nabsorber. For reasons noted in the text, in this paper absorption systems detected within 5000 km s\u22121 of the QSO redshift are classified\nas \"proximate\" (Prox.) absorbers. Systems that displaced by more than 5000 km s\u22121 from zQSO are classified as \"intervening\" (Int.)\nsystems. We also sort the absorbers into three categories based on the correspondence of their O VI and H I profiles; systems in which all\nH I and O VI components are aligned (see \u00a72.3.2) are classified as \"simple\", while absorbers that show significant velocity offsets between\nH I and O VI components are classified as \"complex\". These absorber classifications are listed in parentheses below the absorber redshift\nin this column.\nb\nFor each component, we list the velocity centroid (v), Doppler parameter (b), and column density (N ) obtained from Voigt-profile\nfitting using the software of Fitzpatrick & Spitzer (1997). The listed parameter uncertainties primarily reflect the random noise in the\nmeasurements. In some cases, systematic uncertainties due to effects such as line saturation and blending can be larger than the formal\nuncertainties listed in the table. For these more uncertain measurements, we list the formal error bars indicated by the fitting, but we\nflag the measurements with a colon. Comments on the source of the additional systematic uncertainties are presented in the Appendix.\nc\nComments on line identification, hot pixels, blending, and saturation issues are provided for specfic systems in the Appendix. The\ncomments in the Appendix are numbered, and for cross-referencing convenience, the number in the notes column indicates the comment\nnumber in the Appendix.\n\n\fIGM O VI Statistics\n\n69\n\nTABLE 4\nIntervening O VI Absorbers: Number per Redshift Interval\nLimiting Wr\n(m\u00c5)\n(1)\n\nNumber of\nO VI Systems\n(2)\n\nTotal \u2206z\n(3)\n\ndN/dz\n(Systems)\n(4)\n\ndN/dz\n(Components)\n(5)\n\n30\n\n41\n\n2.623\n\n15.6+2.9\n\u22122.4\n\n21.0+3.2\n\u22122.8\n\n70\n\n27\n\n3.063\n\n8.8+2.1\n\u22121.7\n\n9.5+2.1\n\u22121.8\n\n100\n\n14\n\n3.121\n\n4.5+1.5\n\u22121.2\n\n4.2+1.5\n\u22121.2\n1.9+1.1\n\u22120.8\n0.3+0.7\n\u22120.3\n\n200\n\n6\n\n3.177\n\n2.2+1.2\n\u22120.8\n\n300\n\n3\n\n3.179\n\n0.9+1.0\n\u22120.5\n\nNote. - (1) Limiting rest-frame equivalent width of the sample (the\ncorresponding quantities listed in columns 2-4 are for all absorbers in\nthe 16 QSO sight lines with rest-frame equivalent width greater than\nthe limiting Wr ); (2) number of absorption systems in the sample (as\ndiscussed in the text, absorption \"systems\" can include multiple discrete\ncomponents); (3) total redshift path (summed over all 16 sight lines) over\nwhich the spectra have sufficient S/N and resolution to detect lines with\nequivalent width greater than the limiting Wr ; (4) number of O VI systems per unit redshift; (5) number of discrete O VI components per unit\nredshift.
