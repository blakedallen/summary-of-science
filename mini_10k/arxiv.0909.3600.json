Introduction\nWe present here a new theory of discrete analytic functions, generalising to\ndiscrete Riemann surfaces the notion introduced by Lelong-Ferrand [LF].\nAlthough the theory defined here may be applied wherever the usual Riemann Surfaces theory can, it was primarily designed with statistical mechanics,\nand particularly the Ising model, in mind [McCW,ID]. Most of the results can\n\n\f2\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nbe understood without any prior knowledge in statistical mechanics. The other\nobvious fields of application in two dimensions are electrical networks, elasticity\ntheory, thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, all fields in which continuous Riemann surfaces theory gives wonderful results. The relationship between the Ising\nmodel and holomorphy is almost as old as the theory itself. The key connection\nto the Dirac equation goes back to the work of Kaufman [K] and the results in\nthis paper should come as no surprise for workers in statistical mechanics; they\nknew or suspected them for a long time, in one form or another. The aim of\nthis paper is therefore, from the statistical mechanics point of view, to define a\ngeneral theory as close to the continuous theory as possible, in which claims as\n\"the Ising model near criticality converges to a theory of Dirac spinors\" are given\na precise meaning and a proof, keeping in mind that such meanings and proofs\nalready exist elsewhere in other forms. The main new result in this context is\nthat there exists a discrete Dirac spinor near criticality in the finite size Ising\nmodel, before the thermodynamic limit is taken. Self-duality, which enabled\nthe first evaluations of the critical temperature [KW,Ons,Wan50], is equivalent\nto criticality at finite size. It is given a meaning in terms of compatibility with\nholomorphy.\nThe first idea in order to discretise surfaces is to consider cellular decompositions. Equipping a cellular decomposition of a surface with a discrete metric,\nthat is giving each edge a length, is sufficient if one only wants to do discrete harmonic analysis. However it is not enough if one wants to define discrete analytic\ngeometry. The basic idea of this paper is to consider not just the cellular decomposition but rather what we call its double, i.e. the pair consisting of the cellular\ndecomposition together with its Poincar\u00e9 dual. A discrete conformal structure is\nthen a class of metrics on the double where we retain only the ratio of the lengths\nof dual edges1 . In Ising model terms, a discrete conformal structure is nothing\nmore than a set of interaction constants on each edge separating neighbouring\nspins in an Ising model of a given topology.\nA function of the vertices of the double is said to be discrete holomorphic if\nit satisfies the discrete Cauchy-Riemann equation, on two dual edges (x, x\u2032 ) and\n(y, y \u2032 ),\nf (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)\nf (y \u2032 ) \u2212 f (y)\n=\ni\n.\nl(y, y \u2032 )\nl(x, x\u2032 )\nThis definition gives rise to a theory which is analogous to the classical theory\nof Riemann surfaces. We define discrete differential forms on the double, a Hodge\nstar operator, discrete holomorphic forms, and prove analogues of the Hodge\ndecomposition and Weyl's lemma. We extend to our situation the notion of pole\nof order one and we prove existence theorems for meromorphic differentials with\nprescribed poles and holonomies. Similarly, we define a Green potential and a\nCauchy integral formula.\nUp to this point, the theory is purely combinatorial. In order to relate the\ndiscrete and continuous theories on a Riemann surface, we need to impose an\nextra condition on the discrete conformal structure to give its parameters a geometrical meaning. We call this semi-criticality in Sect. 3. The main result here is\n1 By definition, a discrete Riemann surface is a discrete surface equipped with a discrete\nconformal structure in this sense.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n3\n\ny\u2032\nl(y, y \u2032)\nx\n\n\u2032\nl(x, x\u2032 ) x\n\ny\nFig. 1: The discrete Cauchy-Riemann equation.\n\nthat the limit of a pointwise convergent sequence of discrete holomorphic functions, on a refining sequence of semi-critical cellular decompositions of the same\nRiemann surface, is a genuine holomorphic function on the Riemann surface. If\none imposes the stronger condition of criticality on the discrete conformal structure, one can define a wedge product between functions and 1-forms which is\ncompatible with holomorphy.\nFinally, for applications of this theory to statistical physics, one needs to\ndefine a discrete analogue of spinor fields on Riemann surfaces. In Sect. 4 we\nfirst define the notion of a discrete spin structure on a discrete surface. It sheds\nan interesting light onto the continuous notion, allowing us to redefine it in\nexplicit geometrical terms. In the case of a discrete Riemann surface we then\ndefine a discrete Dirac equation, generalising an equation appearing in the Ising\nmodel, and show that criticality of the discrete conformal structure is equivalent\nto the existence of a local massless Dirac spinor field.\nIn Sect. 2, we present definitions and properties of the theory which are purely\ncombinatorial. First, in the empty boundary case, we recall the definitions of dual\ncellular complexes, notions of deRham cohomology. We define the double \u039b, we\npresent the discrete Cauchy-Riemann equation, the discrete Hodge star on \u039b, the\nLaplacian and the Hodge decomposition. In Subsect. 2.2, we prove Dirichlet and\nNeumann theorems, the basic tools of discrete harmonic analysis. In Subsect. 2.3\nwe prove existence theorems for 1-forms with prescribed poles and holonomies.\nIn Subsect. 2.4, we deal with the basic difficulty of the theory: The Hodge star\nis defined on \u039b while the wedge product is on another complex, the diamond\n\u2666, obtained from \u0393 or \u0393 \u2217 by the procedure of tile centering [GS87]. We prove\nWeyl's lemma, Green's identity and Cauchy integral formulae.\nIn Sect. 3, we define semi-criticality and criticality and prove that it agrees\nwith the usual notion for the Ising model on the square and triangular lattices.\nWe present Vorono\u0131\u0308 and Delaunay semi-critical maps in order to give examples\nand we prove the continuous limit theorem. We prove that every Riemann surface\nadmits a critical map and give examples. On a critical map, the product between\n\n\f4\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nfunctions and 1-forms is compatible with holomorphy and yields a polynomial\nring, integration and derivation of functions. We give an example showing where\nthe problems are.\nIn Sect. 4, we set up the Dirac equation on discrete spin structures. We motivate the discrete universal spin structure by first showing the same construction\nin the continuous case. We show discrete holomorphy property for Dirac spinors,\nwe prove that criticality is equivalent to the existence of local Dirac spinors and\npresent a continuous limit theorem for Dirac spinors.\n2. Discrete Harmonic and Holomorphic Functions\nIn this section, we are interested in properties of combinatorial geometry. The\nconstructions are considered up to homeomorphisms, that is to say on a combinatorial surface, as opposed to Sect. 3 where criticality implies that the discrete\ngeometry is embedded in a genuine Riemann surface.\n2.1. First definitions. Let \u03a3 be an oriented surface without boundary. A cellular\ndecomposition \u0393 of \u03a3 is a partition of \u03a3 into disjoint connected sets, called cells,\nof three types: a discrete set of points, the vertices \u03930 ; a set of non intersecting\npaths between vertices, the edges \u03931 ; and a set of topological discs bounded by\na finite number of edges and vertices, the oriented faces \u03932 . A parametrisation\nof each cell is chosen, faces are mapped to standard polygons of the euclidean\nplane, and edges to the segment (0, 1); we recall particularly that for each edge,\none of its two possible orientations is chosen arbitrarily. We consider only locally\nfinite decompositions, i.e. any compact set intersects a finite number of cells. In\neach dimension, we define the space of chains C\u2022 (\u0393 ) as the Z-module generated\nby the cells. The boundary operator \u2202 : Ck (\u0393 ) \u2192 Ck\u22121 (\u0393 ) partially encodes the\nincidence relations between cells. It fulfills the boundary condition \u2202\u2202 = 0.\nWe now describe the dual cellular decomposition \u0393 \u2217 of a cellular decomposition \u0393 of a surface without boundary. We refer to [Veb] for the general\ndefinition. Though we formally use the parametrisation of each cell for the definition of the dual, its combinatorics is intrinsically well defined. To each face\nF \u2208 \u03932 we define the vertex F \u2217 \u2208 \u03930\u2217 inside the face F , the preimage of the origin of the euclidean plane by the parametrisation of the face. Each edge e \u2208 \u03931 ,\nseparates two faces, say F1 , F2 \u2208 \u03931 (which may coincide), hence is identified\nwith a segment on the boundary of the standard polygon corresponding to F1 ,\nrespectively F2 . We define the dual edge e\u2217 \u2208 \u03931\u2217 as the preimage of the two segments in these polygons, joining the origin to the point of the boundary mapped\nto the middle of e. It is a simple path lying in the faces F1 and F2 , drawn between the two vertices F1\u2217 and F2\u2217 (which may coincide), cutting no edge but e,\nonce and transversely. As the surface is oriented, to the oriented edge e we can\nassociate the oriented dual edge e\u2217 such that (e, e\u2217 ) is direct at their crossing\npoint. To each vertex v \u2208 \u03930 , with v1 , . . . , vn \u2208 \u03930 as neighbours, we define the\nface v \u2217 \u2208 \u03932\u2217 by its boundary \u2202v \u2217 = (v, v1 )\u2217 + . . . + (v, vk )\u2217 + . . . + (v, vn )\u2217 .\nRemark 1. \u0393 \u2217 is a cellular decomposition of \u03a3 [Veb]. If we choose a parametrisation of the cells of \u0393 \u2217 , we can consider its dual \u0393 \u2217\u2217 ; it is a cellular decomposition\nhomeomorphic to \u0393 but the orientation of the edges is reversed. The bidual of\ne \u2208 \u03931 is the reversed edge e\u2217\u2217 = \u2212e (see Fig. 2).\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n5\n\nvn\nv1\n\u2217\n\ne\n\nF\u2217\n\nv\n\ne\nv2\n\n0.

We will speak of a k-cell of \u039b as a k-cell of either \u0393 or\n\u0393 \u2217.\nA discrete metric l is an assignment of a positive number l(e) to each edge\ne \u2208 \u039b1 , its length. For convenience the edge with reversed orientation, \u2212e, will\nbe assigned the same length: l(\u2212e) := l(e). Two metrics l, l\u2032 : \u039b1 \u2192 (0, +\u221e)\nbelong to the same discrete conformal structure if the ratio of the lengths\n\u2217\nl\u2032 (e\u2217 )\n)\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c1(e) := l(e\nl(e) = l\u2032 (e) , on each pair of dual edges e \u2208 \u03931 , e \u2208 \u03931 are equal.\nA function f on \u039b is a function defined on the vertices of \u0393 and of \u0393 \u2217 . Such\na function is said to be holomorphic if, for every pair of dual edges (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03931\nand (y, y \u2032 ) = (x, x\u2032 )\u2217 \u2208 \u03931\u2217 , it fulfills\nf (y \u2032 ) \u2212 f (y)\nf (x\u2032 ) \u2212 f (x)\n=i\n.\n\u2032\nl(y, y )\nl(x, x\u2032 )\nIt is the naive discretisation of the Cauchy-Riemann equation for a function f ,\nwhich is, in local orthonormal coordinates (x, y):\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n=i .\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\nHere, we understand two dual edges as being orthogonal.\nThis equation, though simple, was never considered in such a generality. It\nwas introduced by Lelong-Ferrand [LF] for the decomposition of the plane by the\nstandard square lattice Z2 . It is also called monodiffric functions; for background\non this topic, see [Duf]. Polynomials of degree two, restricted to the square lattice,\ngive examples of monodiffric functions.

Harmonic 1-forms\nare also the sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic ones:\nKer \u2206 = Ker d\u2032 \u2295\u22a5 Ker d\u2032\u2032 .\nBeware that \u039b being disconnected, the space of locally constant functions is\n2-dimensional. The function \u03b5 which is +1 on \u0393 and \u22121 on \u0393 \u2217 is chosen as the\nsecond basis vector.\nThe proof is algebraic and the same as in the continuous case. As the Laplacian decomposes onto the two dual graphs, this result tells also that for any\nharmonic 1-form on \u0393 , there exists a unique harmonic 1-form on the dual graph\n\u0393 \u2217 such that the couple is a holomorphic 1-form on \u039b, it's simply \u03b1\u0393 \u2217 := i \u2217 \u03b1\u0393 .\nThese decompositions don't hold in the non-compact case; there exist non-closed\nand/or non-co-closed, harmonic 1-forms.\n\n\f8\n\nChristian Mercat\n\n2.2. Dirichlet and Neumann problems.\nProposition 2 (Dirichlet problem). Consider a finite connected graph \u0393 ,\nequipped with a function \u03c1 on the edges, and a certain non-empty set of points\nD marked as its boundary. For any boundary function f \u2202 : (\u2202\u0393 )0 \u2192 C, there\nexists a unique function f , harmonic on \u03930 \\ D such that f |\u2202\u0393 = f \u2202 .\nWe refer to the usual laplacian defined by Eq. 2.1.\nIf f \u2202 = 0, the solution is the null function. Otherwise, it is the minimum of\nthe strictly convex, positive functional f 7\u2192 (df, df ), proper on the non-empty\naffine subspace of functions which agree with f \u2202 on the boundary.\u0003\nDefinition 1. Given \u0393 a cellular decomposition of a compact surface with boundary \u03a3, define the double \u03a3 2 := \u03a3 \u222a \u03a3\u0304, union with the opposite oriented surface,\nalong their boundary. The double \u0393 2 is a cellular decomposition of the compact\nsurface \u03a3 2 . Consider its dual \u0393 2\u2217 and define \u0393 \u2217 := \u03a3 \u2229 \u0393 2\u2217 . We don't take into\naccount the faces of \u0393 2\u2217 which are not completely inside \u03a3 but we do consider\nthe half-edges dual to boundary edges of \u0393 as genuine edges noted (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )1 and\ndefine (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )0 := \u039312\u2217 \u2229 \u2202\u03a3 as the set of their boundary vertices.\nA function \u03c1 on the edges of \u0393 yields an extension to \u03931\u2217 by defining \u03c1(e\u2217 ) :=\n1\n\u03c1(e) .\nRemark 2. \u0393 \u2217 is not a cellular decomposition of the surface; the half-edges dual\nto boundary edges do not bound any face of \u0393 \u2217 .\nProposition 3 (Neumann problem). Consider \u0393 a cellular decomposition\nof a disk, equipped with a function \u03c1 on its edges. Choose a boundary vertex\ny0 \u2208 (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )0 , a value f0 \u2208 C, and on the set of boundary edges e \u2208 (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )1 , not\nincident to y0 , a 1-form \u03b1.\nThen there exists\na Runique function f , harmonic on \u0393 \u2217 \\ (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )0 such that\nR\nf (y0 ) = f0 and e df = e \u03b1 for all e \u2208 (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )1 not incident to y0 .\nIt is a dual problem. Let e\u22170 \u2208 (\u2202\u0393 \u2217 )1 , be the edge incident to y0 and e0 \u2208\n(\u2202\u0393 )1 its dual. Consider, on the set of boundary edges e \u2208 (\u2202\u0393 )1 different from\ne0 , the 1-form defined by i \u2217 \u03b1. Integrating it along the boundary, we get a\nfunction f \u2202 on (\u2202\u0393 )0 , well defined up to an additive constant. The Dirichlet\ntheorem gives us a function f harmonic on \u03930 \\ (\u2202\u0393 )0 corresponding to f \u2202 .\nIntegrating the closed 1-form i \u2217 df on \u0393 \u2217 yields the desired harmonic function\nf .\u0003\nRemark 3. The number of boundary points in \u0393 is the same as in \u0393 \u2217 , and as every\nharmonic function on \u0393 , when the surface is a disk, defines a harmonic function\non \u0393 \u2217 such that their couple is holomorphic, unique up to an additive constant,\nthe space of holomorphic functions, resp. 1-forms, on the double decomposition\nwith boundary \u039b is |(\u2202\u039b)0 |/2 + 1, resp. |(\u2202\u039b)0 |/2 \u2212 1 dimensional.\nThe theorem is true for more general surfaces than a disk but the proof is\ndifferent, see the author's PhD thesis [M]. There are l2 versions of these theorems\ntoo.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n9\n\n2.3. Existence theorems. We have very similar existence theorems to the ones in\nthe continuous case. We begin with the main difference:\nProposition 4. The space of discrete holomorphic 1-forms on a compact surface\nwithout boundary is of dimension twice the genus.\nThe Hodge theorem implies an isomorphism between the space of harmonic\nforms and the cohomology group of \u039b. It is the direct sum of the cohomology\ngroups of \u0393 and of \u0393 \u2217 and each is isomorphic to the cohomology group of the\nsurface which is 2g dimensional on a genus g surface. It splits in two isomorphic\nparts under the type (1, 0) and type (0, 1) sum. As any holomorphic form is\nharmonic, the dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms is 2g.\u0003\nWe can give explicit basis to this vector space as in the continuous case [Sie].\nTo construct them, we begin with meromorphic forms:\nProposition 5. Let \u03a3 be a compact surface with boundary. For each vertex\nx \u2208 \u039b0 \\ \u2202\u2666, and a simple path \u03bb on \u039b going from x to the boundary there exists\na pair of meromorphic 1-forms \u03b1x , \u03b2x with a single pole at x, with residue +1\nand which have pure imaginary, respectively real holonomies, along loops which\ndon't have any edge dual to an edge of \u03bb.\nProposition 6. Let \u03a3 be a compact surface. For each pair of vertices x, x\u2032 \u2208 \u039b0\nwith a simple path \u03bb on \u039b from x to x\u2032 , there exists a unique pair of meromorphic 1-forms \u03b1x,x\u2032 , \u03b2x,x\u2032 with only poles at x and x\u2032 , with residue +1 and \u22121\nrespectively, and which have pure imaginary, respectively real holonomies, along\nloops which don't have any edge dual to an edge of \u03bb.\nIn both cases, the forms are (Id + i\u2217)df with f a solution of a Dirichlet\nproblem at x (and x\u2032 ) for \u03b1 and of a Neumann problem on the surface split open\nalong the path \u03bb for \u03b2. The uniqueness in the second proposition is given by\nthe difference: the poles cancel out and yield a holomorphic 1-form with pure\nimaginary, resp. real holonomies, so its real part, resp. imaginary part, can be\nintegrated into a harmonic, hence constant function. So this part is in fact null.\nBeing a holomorphic 1-form, the other part is null too. We refer to the author's\nPhD thesis [M] for details.\u0003\nAs in the continuous case, it allows us to construct holomorphic forms with\n(no poles and) prescribed holonomies:\nCorollary 1 Let A, B \u2208 Z1 (\u039b) be two non-intersecting simple loops such that\nthere exists exactly one edge of A dual to an edge Rof B (dual loops). RThere exists\na unique holomorphic 1-form \u03a6AB such that Re( B \u03a6AB ) = 1 and \u03b3 \u03a6AB \u2208 iR\nfor every loop \u03b3 which doesn't have any edge dual to an edge of A.\nWe decompose A in two paths \u03bbyx and \u03bbxy . It gives us two 1-forms \u03b2x,y and\n\u03b2y,x , then\n\u03a6AB :=\nfulfills the conditions.\u0003\n\n1\n(\u03b2x,y + \u03b2y,x )\n2i\u03c0\n\n(2.2)\n\n\f10\n\nChristian Mercat\n\n2.4. The diamond \u2666 and its wedge product. Following [Whit], we define a wedge\nproduct, on another complex, the diamond \u2666, constructed out of the double \u039b:\nEach pair of dual edges, say (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03931 and (y, y \u2032 ) = (x, x\u2032 )\u2217 \u2208 \u03931\u2217 , defines (up\nto homeomorphisms) a four-sided polygon (x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) and all these constitute\nthe faces of a cellular complex called \u2666 (see Fig. 3).\n\ny\u2032\n\nx\n\nx\u2032\n\ny\nFig. 3: The diamond \u2666.\n\nOn the other hand, from any cellular decomposition \u2666 of a surface by foursided polygons one can reconstruct the double \u039b. A difference is that \u039b may\nnot be disconnected in two dual pieces \u0393 and \u0393 \u2217 , it is so if each loop in \u2666 is\nof even length; we will restrict ourselves to this simpler case. This is not very\nrestrictive because from a connected double, refining each quadrilateral in four\nsmaller quadrilaterals, one gets a double disconnected in two dual pieces.\n\nDefinition 2. A discrete surface with boundary is defined by a quadrilateral\ncellular decomposition \u2666 of an oriented surface with boundary such that its double\ncomplex \u039b is disconnected in two dual parts.\nThis definition is a generalisation of the more natural previous Definition 1.\nIt allows us to consider any subset of faces of \u2666 as a domain yielding a discrete\nsurface with boundary. While any edge of \u039b has a dual edge, a vertex of \u039b\nhas a dual face if and only if it is an inner vertex. Punctured surfaces can be\nunderstood in these terms too: An inner vertex v \u2208 \u039b0 is a puncture if it is\ndeclared as being on the boundary and its dual face v \u2217 removed from \u039b2 .\nWe construct a discrete wedge product, but while the Hodge star lives on the\ndouble \u039b, the wedge product is defined on the diamond \u2666: \u2227 : C k (\u2666) \u00d7 C l (\u2666) \u2192\nC k+l (\u2666).

We construct an averaging map A\nfrom C \u2022 (\u2666) to C \u2022 (\u039b).

With this definition, d\u039b A = Ad\u2666 , but\nthe map A is neither injective nor always surjective, so we can neither define a\nHodge star on \u2666 nor a wedge product on \u039b.

Criticality\nThe term criticality, as well as our motivation to investigate discrete holomorphic\nfunctions, comes from statistical mechanics, namely the Ising model. A critical\ntemperature is defined that restrains the interaction constants, interpreted here\nas lengths. We will see these geometrical constraints in Sect. 3.3.\nTechnically, as far as the continuous limit theorem is concerned, a weaker\nproperty, called semi-criticality is sufficient, it gives us a product between functions and forms. Moreover, at criticality, this product will be compatible with\nholomorphy.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n15\n\n3.1. Semi-criticality. Define C\u03b8 := {(r, t) : r \u2265 0, t \u2208 R/\u03b8Z}/(0, t) \u223c (0, t\u2032 ) with\nthe metric ds2 := dr2 + r2 dt2 as the standard cone of angle \u03b8 > 0 [Tro].\nThe cones can be realized by cutting and pasting paper, demonstrating their\nlocal isometry with the euclidean complex plane.\nLet \u03a3 be a compact Riemann surface and P \u2282 \u03a3 a discrete set of points. A\nflat Riemannian metric with P as conic singularities is an atlas {ZUx :\nUx \u2192 U \u2032 \u2282 C\u03b8x >}x\u2208P of open sets Ux \u2282 \u03a3, a neighbourhood of a singularity\nx \u2208 P , into open sets of a standard cone, such that the singularity is mapped\nto the vertex of the cone and the changes of coordinates CU,V : U \u2229 V \u2192 C are\neuclidean isometries.\nThere is a lot of freedom allowed in the choice of a flat metric for a given\nclosed Riemann surface \u03a3: Any finite set P P\nof points on \u03a3 with a set of angles\n\u03b8x > 0 for every x \u2208 P such that 2\u03c0\u03c7(\u03a3) = x\u2208P (2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8x ), defines uniquely a\nRiemannian flat metric on \u03a3 with these conic singularities and angles [Tro].\nConsider such a flat riemannian metric on a compact Riemann surface \u03a3 and\n(\u039b, l) a double cellular decomposition of \u03a3 as before.\nDefinition 3. (\u039b, l) is a semi-critical map for this flat metric if the conic\nsingularities are among the vertices of \u039b and \u2666 can be realized such that each face\n(x, y, x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 \u26662 is mapped, by a local isometry Z preserving the orientation, to a\nfour-sided polygon (Z(x), Z(y), Z(x\u2032 ), Z(y \u2032 )) of the euclidean plane, the segments\n[Z(x), Z(x\u2032 )] and [Z(y), Z(y \u2032 )] being of lengths l(x, x\u2032 ), l(y, y \u2032 ) respectively and\nforming a direct orthogonal basis. We name \u03b4(\u039b, l) the supremum of the lengths\nof the edges of \u2666.\n\nThe local isometric maps Z are discrete holomorphic.\nVorono\u0131\u0308 and Delaunay complexes [PS85] are interesting examples of\nsemi-critical dual complexes. Any discrete set of points Q on a flat Riemannian\nsurface, containing the conic singularities, defines such a pair:\nWe first define two partitions V and D of \u03a3 into sets of three types: 2-sets,\n1-sets and 0-sets, and then show that they are in fact dual cellular complexes.\nThey are defined by a real positive function mQ on the surface, the multiplicity.\nConsider a point x \u2208 \u03a3; as the set Q is discrete, the distance d(x, Q) is realized\nby geodesics of minimal length, generically a single one. Let mQ (x) \u2208 [1, \u221e) be\nthe number of such geodesics. If mQ (x) = 1, there exists a vertex \u03c0(x) \u2208 Q such\nthat the shortest geodesic from x to \u03c0(x) is the only geodesic from x to Q with\nsuch a small length.\nThe Vorono\u0131\u0308 2-set associated to a vertex v in Q, is \u03c0 \u22121 (v), that is to say the\nset of points of \u03a3 closer to this vertex than to any other vertex in Q. Each 2-set\n\u22121\nof V is a connected component of mQ\n(1).\nLikewise, the 1-sets are the connected components of m\u22121\nQ (2). They are associated to pairs of points in Q.\nThe 0-sets are the connected components of m\u22121\nQ ([3, +\u221e)). Generically, they\nare associated to three points in Q.\nV is a cellular complex (see below) and the complex D is its dual (generically\na triangulation), its vertices are the points in Q, its edges are segments (x, x\u2032 )\nfor x, x\u2032 \u2208 Q such that there exist points equidistant and closer to them.\nProposition 10. The Vorono\u0131\u0308 partition, on a closed Riemann surface with a\nflat metric with conic singularities, of a given discrete set of points Q containing\nthe conic singularities, is a cellular complex.\n\n\f16\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nWe have to prove that 2-sets are homeomorphic to discs, 1-sets are segments\nand 0-sets are points.\nFirst, 2-sets are star-shaped, for every point x closer to v \u2208 Q than to any\nother point in Q, along a unique portion of a geodesic, the whole segment [x, v]\nhas the same property.\n2-sets are open, if x is closer to v \u2208 Q than to any other point in Q, as it is\ndiscrete, d(x, Q \\ v) \u2212 d(x, v) > 0. By triangular inequality, every point in the\nopen ball of this radius centred at x is closer to v than to any other point in Q.\nSo 2-sets are homeomorphic to discs.\nLet x be a point in a 1-set. It is defined by exactly two portions of geodesics\nD, D\u2032 from x to y, y \u2032 \u2208 Q (they may coincide). By definition, the open sphere\ncentred at x containing D \u222a D\u2032 doesn't contain any point of Q so it can be lifted\nto the universal covering, where the usual rules of euclidean geometry tell us that\nthe set of points equidistant to y and y \u2032 around x is a submanifold of dimension\n1. As the surface is compact, if it is not a segment, it can only be a circle. Then,\nit's easy to see that the surface is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere and that y and\ny \u2032 are the only points in Q. But this is impossible because an euclidean metric\non a 2-sphere has at least three conic singularities [Tro].\nThe same type of arguments shows that 0-sets are isolated points.\u0003\n\nFig. 6: The Vorono\u0131\u0308/Delaunay decompositions associated to two points on a\ngenus two surface.\n\nProposition 11. Such Delaunay/Vorono\u0131\u0308 dual complexes are semi-critical maps\nof the surface. Hence any Riemann surface admits semi-critical maps.\nThe edge in V dual to (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 D1 is a segment of their mediatrix so is\northogonal to (x, x\u2032 ). Hence, equipped with the euclidean length on the edges,\n(V, D) is a semi-critical map.\u0003\nRemark 5. Apart from Vorono\u0131\u0308/Delaunay maps, circle packings [CdV90] give\nanother very large class of examples of interesting semi-critical decompositions\n(see Fig. 7).\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n17\n\nFig. 7: Circle packing, the dual vertex to a face.\nThe semi-criticality of a double map gives a coherent system of angles \u03c6 in\n(0, \u03c0) on the oriented edges of \u039b. An edge (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 \u039b1 is the diagonal of a certain\ndiamond; \u03c6(x, x\u2032 ) is the angle of that diamond at the vertex x. In particular,\n\u03c6(x, x\u2032 ) 6= \u03c6(x\u2032 , x) a priori. They verify that for every diamond, the sum of the\nangles on the four directions of the two dual diagonals is 2\u03c0 (see Fig. 8).

Continuous limit. We state the main theorem, a converging sequence of\ndiscrete holomorphic functions on a refining sequence of semi-critical maps of\nthe same Riemann surface, converges to a holomorphic function. Precisely:\nTheorem 3. Let \u03a3 be a Riemann surface and (k\u039b, lk )k\u2208N a sequence of semicritical maps on it, with respect to the same flat metric with conic singularities.\n\n\f18\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nAssume that the lengths \u03b4k = \u03b4(k\u039b) tend to zero and that the angles at the\nvertices of all the faces of the k\u2666 are in the interval [\u03b7, 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7] with \u03b7 > 0.\nLet (fk )k\u2208N be a sequence of discrete holomorphic functions fk \u2208 \u03a9(k\u039b), such\nthat there exists a function f on \u03a3 which verifies, for every\n\u0001\n\u0001 converging sequence\n(xk )k\u2208N of points of \u03a3 with each xk \u2208 k\u039b0 , f limk (xk ) = limk fk (xk ) , then\nthe function f is holomorphic on \u03a3.\nSuch a refining sequence is easy to produce (see Fig. 9) but the theorem\ntakes into account more general sequences. A more natural refining sequence,\nwhich mixes the two dual sequences is given by a series of tile centering procedures [GS87]: If one calls \u2666/2 the cellular decomposition constructed from \u2666 by\nreplacing each tile by four smaller ones of half its size, and \u0393 (\u2666/2), \u0393 \u2217(\u2666/2) the\ndouble cellular decomposition it defines, one has\n\u0393 (\u2666/2) = \u0393 (\u2666)\" \u222a \"\u0393 \u2217 (\u2666) and the interesting following sequence:\n\u0393 (\u2666) \u2192 \u2666 \u2192 \u0393 (\u2666/2) \u2192 \u2666/2 \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u2666/2n \u2192 . . .\n\u0580 \u0581\n\u0580\n\u0581\n\u0580\n\u0581\n.\n\u0393 \u2217 (\u2666)\n\u0393 \u2217 (\u2666/2)\n***\n***\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe horizontal arrows correspond to tile centering procedures, and the ascending,\nrespectively descending arrows, to tile centering, resp. edge centering procedures.\nThis sequence is not that exciting though since locally, the graph rapidly looks\nlike a rectangular lattice. More interesting inflation rules staying at criticality\ncan be considered too (see Fig. 21).\nThe demonstration of the continuous limit theorem needs three lemmas:\n\nFig. 9: Refining a semi-critical map.\n\nLemma 2. Let (fk )k\u2208N be a sequence of functions on an open set \u03a9 \u2282 C such\nthat there exists a function f on \u03a9\u0001 verifying, for every\nconverging sequence\n\u0001\n(xk )k\u2208N of points of \u03a9, f limk (xk ) = limk fk (xk ) . Then the function f is\ncontinuous and uniform limit of (fk ) on any compact.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n19\n\nTaking a constant sequence of points, we see that (fk ) converges to f pointwise. So with the notations of the theorem, (fk (xk )) converges to f (x) and\n(fl (xk ))l\u2208N to f (xk ). Combining the two, (f (xk )) converges to f (x) so f is continuous. If the convergence was not uniform on a compac sett, then there would\nexist a converging sequence (xk ) with (fk (xk ) \u2212 f (xk )) not converging to zero.\nBut f is continuous in x = lim(xk ) and (fk (xk )) converges to f (x), which,\ncombined, contradicts the hypotheses.\u0003\nLemma 3. Let (ABCD) be a four sided polygon of the Euclidean plane such\nthat its diagonals are orthogonal and the vertices angles are in [\u03b7, 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7] with\n\u03b7 > 0.

Let (\u039b, l) be any double cellular decomposition and \u03b1 \u2208 C 1 (\u2666) a\nclosed 1-form. The 1-form f * \u03b1 is closed for any holomorphic function f \u2208 \u03a9(\u039b)\nif and only if \u03b1 is holomorphic.\nJust check.\nProof 3. We interpolate each function fk from the discrete set of points k\u039b0\nto a function f \u0304k of the whole surface, linearly on the edges of k\u2666 and harmonicly\nin its faces.\nLet (\u03b6k ) be a converging sequence of points in \u03a3. Each \u03b6k is in the adherence\nof a face of k\u2666. Let xk , yk be the minimum and maximum of Re fk around the\nface. By the maximum principle for the harmonic function Re f \u0304k ,\nRe fk (xk ) \u2264 Re f \u0304k (\u03b6k ) \u2264 Re fk (yk ).\n\n\f20\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nMoreover, the distance between xk and \u03b6k is at most 2\u03b4k , as well as for yk . It\nimplies that (xk ) and (yk ) converge to x = lim(\u03b6k ), (fk (xk )) and (fk (yk )) to\nf (x), and (Re f \u0304k (\u03b6k )) to Re f (x); and similarly for its imaginary part. So, by\nLemma 2, the function f is continuous, and is the uniform limit of (f \u0304k ) on every\ncompact set. In particular, it is bounded on any compact.\nBy the theorem of inessential singularities, since f is continuous hence bounded\non any compact set, and that conic singularities form a discrete set in \u03a3, to show\nthat f is holomorphic, we can restrict ourselves to each element U \u2282 \u03a3 of a euclidean atlas of the punctured surface (without conic singularities). We have an\nexplicit coordinate z on U .\nLet \u03b3 beH a homotopically trivial loop in U of finite length l. We are going to\nprove that \u03b3 f dz = 0. The theorem of Morera then states that f is holomorphic.\nLet us fix the integer k. By application of Lemma 3 on every face of k\u2666 crossed\n4l\nby \u03b3, we construct a loop \u03b3k \u2208 C1 (k\u2666), homotopic to \u03b3, of length l(\u03b3k ) \u2264 sin\n\u03b7\nk\n(see Fig. 11). As the diameter of a face of \u2666 is at most 2\u03b4k , all these faces are\ncontained in the tubular neighbourhood of \u03b3 of diameter 4\u03b4k .

But as the diagonals of this parallelogram are orthogonal, it\nis a lozenge (or rhombus, or diamond).\nDefinition 4. A double (\u039b, l) of a Riemann surface \u03a3 is critical if it is semicritical and each face of \u26662 are lozenges. Let \u03b4(\u039b) be the common length of their\nsides.\nRemark 6. This has an intrinsic meaning on \u03a3, the faces of \u2666 are genuine\nlozenges on the surface and every edge of \u039b can be realized by segments of\nlength given by l, two dual edges being orthogonal segments.\n\n\f22\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nAnother equivalent way to look at criticality can be useful: a double (\u039b, l) is\n^\ncritical if there exists an application Z : \u03a3\n\\ P \u2192 C from the universal covering\nof the punctured surface \u03a3 \\ P for a finite set P \u2282 \u039b0 into C identified to the\noriented Euclidean plane R2 such that\n\u2013 the image of an edge a \u2208 \u039b\u03031 is a linear segment of length l(a),\n\u2013 two dual edges are mapped to a direct orthogonal basis,\n\u2013 Z is an embedding out of the vertices,\n\u2013 there exists a representation \u03c1 of the fundamental group \u03c01 (\u03a3 \\ P ) into the\ngroup of isometries of the plane respecting orientation such that,\n\u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (\u03a3 \\ P ), Z \u25e6 \u03b3 = \u03c1(\u03b3) \u25e6 Z,\n\u2013 and the lengths of all the segments corresponding to the edges of \u2666 are all\nequal to the same \u03b4 > 0.\nThe criticality of a double map gives a coherent system of angles \u03c6 in (0, \u03c0)\non the unoriented edges of \u039b, \u03c6(x, x\u2032 ) is the angle in the lozenge for which (x, x\u2032 )\nis a diagonal, at the vertex x (or x\u2032 ). They verify that for every lozenge, the sum\nof the angles on the dual diagonals is \u03c0. Then the conic angle at a vertex is given\nby the sum of the angles over the incident edges.\nEvery discrete conformal structure (\u039b, l) defines a conformal structure on\nthe associated topological surface by pasting lozenges together according to the\ncombinatorial data (though most of the vertices will be conic singularities). Conversely,\nTheorem 4. Every closed Riemann surface accepts a critical map.\nProof 4. We first produce critical maps for cylinders of any modulus: Consider\na row of n squares and glue back its ends to obtain a cylinder, its modulus, the\nratio of the square of the distance from top to bottom by its area is n1 .\nStacking m such rows upon each other, one gets a cylinder of modulus m\nn.\nSquares can be bent into lozenges yielding a continuous family of cylinders of\nmoduli ranging from zero to n2 (see Fig. 12). Hence we can get cylinders of any\nmodulus.\n\nFig. 12: Two bent rows.\n\nDehn twists can be performed on these critical cylinders, see Fig. 13.\nGluing three cylinders together along their bottom (n has to be even), one\ncan produce trinions of any modulus (see Fig. 14) and these trinions can be\nglued together according to any angle. Hence, every Riemann surface can be so\nproduced [Bus]. \u0003\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n23\n\n2\u03c0 cos \u03b8\nn\n\n\u03b8\n\u03c6\nFig. 13: Performing a Dehn twist.\n\nFig. 14: Gluing three cylinders into a trinion.\nRemark 7. An equilateral surface is a Riemann surface which can be triangulated\nby equilateral triangles with respect to a flat metric with conic singularities.\nEquilateral surfaces are the algebraic curves over Q\u0304 [VoSh] so are dense among\nthe Riemann surfaces. Cutting every equilateral triangle into nine, three times\nsmaller, triangles (see Fig. 15), one can couple these triangles by pairs so that\nthey form lozenges, hence a critical map.\nIn Figures 16\u201319 are some examples of critical decompositions of the plane.\nIn Fig. 20, a higher genus example, found in Coxeter [Cox1], of the cellular\ndecomposition of a collection of handlebodies (the genus depends on how the\nsides are glued pairwise) by ten regular pentagons, the centre is a branched\npoint of order three; together with its dual, they form a critical map. It is the\ncase for any cellular decomposition by just one regular tile when its vertices are\nco-cyclic. This decomposition gives rise to a critical sequence using the Penrose\ninflation rule [GS87]. Fig. 21 illustrates this inflation rule sequence on a simpler\ngenus two example where each outer side has to be glued with the other parallel\nside.\n3.4. Physical interpretation.\nTheorem 5.

We prove it by solving another problem which contains these two particular cases, namely the translationally invariant square lattice with period\ntwo [Yam]. At a particular vertex, the flat critical condition on the four conformal parameters is:\n4\nX\narctan \u03c1i = \u03c0,\ni=1\n\nwhich is obviously invariant by all the symmetries of the problem, including\nduality.

This theorem\nis important because it shows that statistical criticality is meaningful even at\nthe finite size level. It is well known [KW] that for lattices, it corresponds to\nself-duality, which has a meaning for finite systems; here we see that self-duality\ncorresponds to a compatibility with holomorphy. In a sense, our notion of criticality defines self-duality for more complex graphs than lattices. Furthermore,\nwe will see in Sect. 4 that criticality implies the existence of a discrete massless Dirac spinor, which is the core of the Ising model. Although we saw that\ncriticality implies a continuous limit theorem, the thermodynamic limit is not\nnecessary for criticality to be detected, and to have an interesting meaning.\nIt is easy to produce higher genus flat critical maps and compute their critical temperature, the examples in Figures 20-21 have four kinds of interactions\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n)\n\n27\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\nFig. 21: Sequence of critical maps of a genus two handlebody using Penrose\ninflation rule.\ncorresponding to the diagonals of the two kinds of quadrilateral tiles.

This creates two conic singularities where\nan extra curvature of \u22122\u03c0 is concentrated at each point, yielding a genus two\nhandlebody. Repeating the process, we may produce critical handlebodies of arbitrarily large genus if we start with a very fine mesh. One has to beware that\nour continuous limit theorem applies only to fixed genus, it cannot grow with\nthe refinement of the mesh. This explains why the union-jack lattice (the square\nlattice and its diagonals) or the three dimensional Ising model, which can be\nmodelled as a genus mnp surface for a 2m \u00d7 2n \u00d7 2p cubic network, are beyond\nthe scope of our technique as far as a continuous limit theorem is concerned.\nWith this restriction in mind, we see that both the existence and the value of\na critical temperature is essentially a local property and neither depends on the\ngenus nor on the modulus of the handlebody. It is not the case for more interesting quantities such as the partition function, which can be obtained in principle\nfrom the discrete Dirac spinor that criticality provides, defined in Sect. 4. But\nsuch a calculus is beyond the scope of this article.\nApart from the standard lattices, the critical temperature of other well known\ngraphs can be computed using our method, for example the labyrinth [BGB],\nwhose diamond is pictured in Fig. 22, has the topology of the square lattice but\nhas five different interactions strengths controlled by two binary words, labelling\nthe columns and rows by 0's and 1's. And also new ones such as the \"street\ngraph\" depicted in Fig. 23. Its double row transfer matrix appears to be the\nproduct of three commuting transfer matrices, two triangular and a square one.\nOther cases such as the Kagom\u00e9 [Syo] or more generally lattices of chequered\ntype [Uti] can be handled using a technique called electrical moves [CdV96]\n\n\f28\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nFig. 22: The diamond graph of a critical labyrinth lattice.\n\nFig. 23: The \"street\" lattice.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n29\n\nwhich enables us to move around, and causes appearing or disappearing conic\nsingularities of a flat metric. This will be the subject of a subsequent article,\nexplaining the relationship between discrete holomorphy, electrical moves and\nknots and links. These electrical moves act in the space of all the graphs with\ndiscrete conformal structures in a similar way to that of the Baxterisation processes in the spectral parameter space of an integrable model (see [AdABM]).\nWe are going to see that the link with statistical mechanics is even deeper than\nsimply pointing out a submanifold of critical systems inside the huge space of all\nIsing models, as the similarity with the continuous case extends to the existence\nof a discrete Dirac spinor near criticality.\n3.5.

Dirac Equation\nAlthough we believe our theory can be applied to a lot of different problems, our\nmotivation was to shed new light on statistical mechanics and the Ising model\nin particular. This statistical model has been linked with Dirac spinors since the\nwork of Kaufman [K] and Onsager and Kaufman [KO]. We refer among others\nto [McCW81,SMJ,KC]. Hence we are interested in setting up a Dirac equation in\nthe context of discrete holomorphy. To achieve this goal we first have to define\nthe discrete analogue of the fibre bundle on which spinors live. We therefore\nhave to define a discrete spin structure. Physics provides us with a geometric\ndefinition [KC] based on paths in a certain Z2 -homology, that we generalise to\nour need (higher genus, boundary, arbitrary topology). We begin by showing\nthat such an object in the continuum is indeed a spin structure, then define the\ndiscrete object. We then set up the Dirac equation for discrete spinors, show\nthat it implies holomorphy and that the existence of a solution is equivalent to\ncriticality. The Ising model gives us an object which satisfies the discrete Dirac\nequation, namely the fermion, \u03a8 = \u03c3\u03bc as defined in [KC], corresponding to a\nsimilar object defined previously by Kaufman [K]. It fulfills the Dirac equation\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n31\n\nat criticality, but also off criticality, corresponding to a massive Dirac spinor.\nWe will end this article by describing off-criticality, as defined by the author's\nPh.D. advisor, Daniel Bennequin.\n4.1. Universal spin structure. A spin structure [Mil] on a principal fibre bundle\n(E, B) over a manifold B, with SO(n) as a structural group, is a principal fibre\nbundle (E \u2032 , B), of structural group Spin(n), and a map f : E \u2032 \u2192 E such that\nthe following diagram is commutative:\nE \u2032 \u00d7 Spin(n) \u2192 E \u2032\n\u2193 f \u00d7\u03bb\n\n\u2193f\n\nE \u00d7 SO(n) \u2192 E\n\n\u0581\n\nB\n\n\u0580\n\nwhere \u03bb is the standard 2-fold covering homomorphism from Spin(n) to SO(n).\nIn this paper we consider only spin structures on the tangent bundle of a\nsurface. On a generic Riemann surface \u03a3, there is not a canonical spin structure.\nWe are going to describe a surface \u03a3\u0302, 22\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3) -fold covering of \u03a3, on which there\nexists a preferred spin structure. It allows us to define every spin structure on \u03a3\nas a quotient of this universal spin structure. We will treat the continuous case\nand then the discrete case.\nDefinition 7. Let \u03a3 be a differentiable surface with a base-point y 0 ; \u03a3\u0302 is the\nset of pairs (z, [\u03bb]2 ), where z \u2208 \u03a3 is a point and [\u03bb]2 the homology of a path \u03bb\nfrom y 0 to z considered in the relative homology H1 (\u03a3, {y 0 , z}) \u2297 Z2 .\n\u03a3\u0302 is the 22\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3) covering associated to the intersection H of the kernels of\nall the homomorphisms from \u03c01 (\u03a3) to Z2 , that is to say the quotient of the\nuniversal covering by the subgroup H \u2282 \u03c01 (\u03a3) of loops whose homology is null\nmodulo two.\nChoose v0 a tangent vector at y 0 . For each point z \u2208 \u03a3, define \u03a3z := \u03a3 \\\n{y 0 , z} \u2294 S1 \u2294 S1 , the blown up of \u03a3 at y 0 and z (add only one circle in the case\ny 0 = z). Consider the set of oriented paths in \u03a3z , from the point corresponding\nto the vector v0 at y 0 to the directions at z (the vector v0 is needed only when\nz = y 0 ). Define an equivalence relation \u223cz (see Fig. 25) on this set by stating\nthat two paths \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 are equivalent if and only if \u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2032 is a cycle and [\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2032 ]2 = 0\nin the homology H1 (\u03a3 \\ {z}, Z2 ).\nDefinition 8. The universal spin structure S of \u03a3 is the set of pairs (z, [\u03bb]\u223cz ),\nwith z \u2208 \u03a3 and [\u03bb]\u223cz the \u223cz -equivalence class of the path \u03bb from y 0 to z in \u03a3z .\nTheorem 7. S is a spin structure on \u03a3\u0302 and is the only one such that the action\nof the fundamental group \u03c01 (\u03a3) on \u03a3\u0302 can be lifted to. Moreover it is the pull-back\nof any spin structure on \u03a3.\nProof . The proof is in three steps, we check that S is a spin structure, we define\na spin structure S0 through group theory and we show that both are equal to a\nthird spin structure S1 .\n\n\f32\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nz\n\nz\nv0\n1. z 6= y 0\n\n2. z = y 0\n\nFig. 25: Paths of different classes with respect to \u223cz for z 6= y 0 and z = y 0 .\nThere is an obvious projection from S to \u03a3\u0302 defined by (z, [\u03bb]\u223cz ) 7\u2192 (z, [\u03bb]2 ).\nThe fibre of this projection at (z, [\u03bb]2 ) is the set of \u223cz -equivalence classes of\npaths from y 0 to the blown-up circle at z. To each class is associated the tangent\ndirection at z so Sz is a covering of STz (\u03a3\u0302). As H1 (\u03a3 \\ {z}, Z2) is 23\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3)\ndimensional (a loop around z is not homologically trivial), for each point in\nST (\u03a3\u0302), there are two different lifts. The path in Sz corresponding to turning\naround z once yields the Z2 -deck transformation. Hence S is a spin structure on\n\u03a3\u0302.\nLet G := \u03c01 (\u03a3) and G\u2032 := \u03c01 (ST \u03a3); the S1 -fibre bundle ST (\u03a3) \u2192 \u03a3 induces\na short exact sequence Z \u0592\u2192 G\u2032 \u2192\n\u2192G. Every double covering of ST \u03a3 is defined\nby the kernel S \u2032 of an homomorphism u from G\u2032 to Z/2, moreover, for S \u2032 to be\na spin structure, its intersection with the subgroup Z must be 2Z.\nLikewise, the fibration \u03a3\u0302 \u2192 \u03a3 implies that the fundamental group H \u2032 :=\n\u03c01 (ST \u03a3\u0302) of the directions bundle of \u03a3\u0302 is the subgroup of G\u2032 over H := \u03c01 (\u03a3\u0302),\nZ \u2192 H\u2032 \u2192 H\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193,\nZ \u2192 G\u2032 \u2192 G\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe intersection of the subgroups H \u2032 and S \u2032 is a well defined spin structure\nS0 on \u03a3\u0302: Indeed, consider another spin structure S \u2032\u2032 = Ker (v : G\u2032 \u2192 Z/2) on\n\u03a3, its intersection with Z is 2Z hence the kernel of u \u2212 v contains the whole\nsubgroup Z, that is to say u \u2212 v comes from a homomorphism of G to Z/2 and\nwe have S \u2032\u2032 \u2229 H \u2032 = S \u2032 \u2229 H \u2032 . In other words, S0 is the unique spin structure on\n\u03a3\u0302 which is the pull-back of a spin structure on \u03a3 and it is the pull-back of any\nspin structure.\nLet z \u2208 \u03a3 be a point, consider the set of paths in ST \u03a3 from the base point\n(y 0 , v 0 ) to any direction at z. Consider on this set the equivalence relation \u223c\u2032z\ndefined by fixed extremities Z/2-homology. The class [\u03bb]\u223c\u2032z of a path \u03bb from\n(y 0 , v 0 ) to (z, v) is its homology class in H1 (ST \u03a3, {(y 0, v 0 ), (z, v)}) \u2297 Z/2. The\nprojection ST \u03a3 \u2192\n\u2192\u03a3 splits H1 (ST \u03a3, {(y 0, v 0 ), (z, v)}) \u2297 Z/2 into\nZ/2 \u2192 H1 (ST \u03a3, {(y 0, v 0 ), (z, v)}) \u2297 Z/2 \u2192 H1 (\u03a3, {y 0 , z}) \u2297 Z/2,\n\n(4.2)\n\nhence the set S1 of pairs (z, [\u03bb]\u223c\u2032z ) for all points z \u2208 \u03a3 and all paths \u03bb, is a spin\nstructure on \u03a3\u0302.\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n33\n\nLet S \u2032 be a spin structure on \u03a3, it defines an element in Z/2 for each loop\nin ST \u03a3. So each path in ST \u03a3 beginning at (y 0 , v 0 ) defines, through the splitting 4.2, an element in S1 which is then the pull-back of S \u2032 to \u03a3\u0302, hence S0 = S1 .\nOn the other hand S = S1 because there is a continuous projection from S to\nS1 : For an element (z, [\u03bb]\u223cz ), consider a C 1 -path \u03bb \u2208 \u03a3 representing the class.\nLift it to a path in ST \u03a3 by the tangent direction at each point, its class [\u03bb]\u223c\u2032z\nonly depends on [\u03bb]\u223cz and gives us an element in S1 . \u0003\n4.2. Discrete spin structure.\nDefinition 9. Let \u03a5 be a cellular complex of dimension two, a spin structure\non \u03a5 is a graph \u03a5 \u2032 , double cover of the 1-skeleton of \u03a5 such that the lift of the\nboundary of every face is a non-trivial double cover. They are considered up to\nisomorphisms. Let SD be the set of such spin structures.\nA spinor \u03c8 on \u03a5 \u2032 is an equivariant complex function on \u03a5 \u2032 regarding the\n \u0304 = \u2212\u03c8(\u03be) if \u03be \u0304 represents the\naction of Z/2, that is to say, for all \u03be \u2208 \u03a50\u2032 , \u03c8(\u03be)\nother lift.\nRemark 8. Usually, a spinor field is a section of a spinor bundle, that is to say a\nsquare root of a tangent vector field. Here, we consider square roots of covectors;\nwe should say cospinors.\nA discrete spin structure is encoded by a representation of the cycles of \u03a5 ,\nZ1 (\u03a5 ) := Ker \u2202 \u2229 C1 (\u03a5 ), into Z/2 which associates to \u03b3 \u2208 Z1 (\u03a5 ), the value\n\u03bc(\u03b3) = 0 if it can be lifted in \u03a5 \u2032 to a cycle and \u03bc(\u03b3) = 1 if it can not. By\nconstruction, the value of the boundary of a face is 1 and the value of a cycle\nwhich is the boundary of a 2-chain of \u03a5 is the number of faces enclosed, modulo\ntwo.\nWe are going to show that this structure is indeed a good notion of discrete\nspin structure. First, there are as many discrete spin structures on a surface as\nthere are in the continuous case:\nProposition 14. On a closed connected oriented genus g surface \u03a3, the set SD\nof inequivalent discrete spin structures of a cellular decomposition \u03a5 is of cardinal\n22g . The space of representations of the fundamental group of the surface into\nZ/2 acts freely and transitively on SD .\nWe explicitly build discrete spin structures and count them: Let T be a maximal\ntree of \u03a5 , that is to say a sub-complex of dimension one containing all the vertices\nof \u03a5 and a maximal subset of its edges such that there is no cycle in T . Choose\n2g edges (ek )1\u2264k\u22642g in \u03a5 \\ T such that the 2g cycles (\u03b3k ) \u2208 Z1 (\u03a5 )2g extracted\nfrom (T \u222a ek )1\u2264k\u22642g form a basis of the fundamental group of \u03a3 (and \u03a5 ). Let\nT+ := T \u222ak ek and consider T \u2032 , the sub-complex of the dual \u03a5 \u2217 formed by all the\nedges in \u03a5 \u2217 not crossed by T+ . It is a maximal tree of \u03a5 \u2217 . Likewise we define\nT+\u2032 := T \u2032 \u222ak e\u2217k .\nWe construct inductively a spin structure \u03a5 \u2032 : its first elements are a double\ncopy of T and we add edges without any choice to make as we take leaves out of\nT+\u2032 . When only cycles are left, a choice concerning an edge ek has to be taken,\nopening a cycle in T+\u2032 . The process goes on until T+\u2032 is empty.\n\n\f34\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nThese choices are completely encoded by a representation \u03bc such as in the\nremark, and the 2g values (\u03bc(\u03b3k ))1\u2264k\u22642g determine the spin structure. On the\nother hand, this representation defines the spin structure and there are 22g such\ndifferent representations. Hence the choices of the maximal tree and the edges\nek are irrelevant.\nBecause a cycle in \u03a5 belongs to a class in the fundamental group of the\nsurface (up to a choice of a path to the base point, irrelevant for our matter),\nthe representations of the fundamental group into Z/2 obviously act on spin\nstructures: A representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (\u03a3) \u2192 Z/2 associates to a spin structure\ndefined by a representation \u03bc : Z1 (\u03a5 ) \u2192 Z/2, the spin structure defined by the\nrepresentation \u03c1(\u03bc) such that \u03c1(\u03bc)(\u03b3) := \u03bc(\u03b3) + \u03c1([\u03b3]), where [\u03b3] \u2208 \u03c01 (\u03a3) is the\nclass of the cycle \u03b3 in the fundamental group. This action is clearly free, and\ntransitive because the set of representations is of cardinal 22g . \u0003\nGiven \u039b = \u0393 \u2294 \u0393 \u2217 a double cellular decomposition, we introduce a cellular\ndecomposition which is the discretised version of the tangent directions bundle\nof both \u0393 and \u0393 \u2217 :\nDefinition 10. The triple graph \u03a5 is a cellular complex whose vertices are unoriented edges of \u2666, \u03a50 = {{x, y}/(x, y) \u2208 \u26661 }. Two vertices {x, y}, {x\u2032 , y \u2032 } \u2208 \u03a50\nare neighbours in \u03a5 iff the edges (x, y) and (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) are incident (that is to say\nx = x\u2032 or x = y \u2032 or y = x\u2032 or y = y \u2032 ), and they bound a common face of \u2666.\nThere are two edges in \u03a5 for each edge in \u039b. For this to be a cellular decomposition of the surface in the empty boundary case, one needs to add faces of three\ntypes, centred on vertices of \u0393 , of \u0393 \u2217 and on faces of \u2666 (see Fig. 26).\n\ny\n\nx\n\nx\u2032\n\ny\u2032\n\nFig. 26: The triple graph \u03a5 .\n\nRemark 9. The topology of the usual tangent directions bundle is not at all\nmimicked by the incidence relations of \u03a5 , the former is 3 dimensional and the\nlatter is a 2-cellular complex.\n\u03a3\u0302.\n\nLet (x0 , y 0 ) \u2208 \u26661 be a given edge. All the complexes \u0393, \u0393 \u2217 , \u2666, \u03a5 are lifted to\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n35\n\nDefinition 11. The discrete universal spin structure \u03a5\u0302 \u2032 is the following\n1-complex: Its vertices are of the form ((x, y), [\u03b3yy0 ]), where (x, y) \u2208 \u03a50 is a pair\nof neighbours in \u2666 and \u03b3yy0 is a path from y 0 to y on \u0393 \u2217 , avoiding the faces x\u2217\nand x0\u2217 . We are interested only in its relative homology class modulo two, that\nis to say [\u03b3yy0 ] \u2208 H1 (\u0393 \u2217 \\ x\u2217 , {y 0 , y}) \u2297 Z2 . We will denote a point by ((x, y), \u03b3yy0 )\nand identify it with ((x, y), \u03b3 \u2032 yy0 ) whenever \u03b3yy0 and \u03b3 \u2032 yy0 are homologous.\n0\n\nTwo points ((x, y), \u03b3yy0 ) and ((x\u2032 , y \u2032 ), \u03b3yy\u2032 ) are neighbours in \u03a5\u0302 \u2032 if\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2013 x = x\u2032 , (y, y \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03931\u2217 and \u03b3yy \u2212 \u03b3yy\u2032 + (y, y \u2032 ) is homologous to zero in H1 (\u0393 \u2217 \\\nx\u2217 ) \u2297 Z2 ,\n0\n0\n\u2013 y = y \u2032 , (x, x\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03931\u2217 and \u03b3yy \u2212 \u03b3yy\u2032 is homologous to zero in H1 (\u0393 \u2217 \\ x\u2217 ) \u2297 Z2 .\n\u03a5\u0302 \u2032 is a double covering of \u03a5\u0302 and it is connected around each face (see Fig. 27).\nIt is a discrete spin structure on \u03a5\u0302 in the sense defined above. Once a basis of the\nfundamental group \u03c01 (\u03a5 ) is chosen, every representation of the homology group\nof \u03a3 into Z2 allows us to quotient this universal spin structure into a double\ncovering of \u03a5 , yielding a usual spin structure \u03a5 \u2032 .\n\nFig. 27: Double covering around faces of \u03a5 .\n\n4.3. Dirac equation. A spinor changes sign between the two lifts in \u03a5 \u2032 of a\nvertex of \u03a5 , in other words it is multiplied by \u22121 when it turns around a\nface. The faces of \u03a5 which are centred on diamonds are four sided. We set\nup the spin symmetry equation for a function \u03b6 on \u03a50\u2032 , on a positively oriented face (\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 , \u03be4 ) \u2208 \u03a52 around a diamond, lifted to an 8-term cycle\n(\u03be1+ , \u03be2+ , \u03be3+ , \u03be4+ , \u03be1\u2212 , \u03be2\u2212 , \u03be3\u2212 , \u03be4\u2212 ) \u2208 Z1 (\u03a5 \u2032 ):\n\u03b6(\u03be3+ ) = i\u03b6(\u03be1+ ).\nIt implies obviously that \u03b6 is a spinor, that is to say \u03b6(\u03be\u2022\u2212 ) = \u2212\u03b6(\u03be\u2022+ ).\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f36\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nThe coherent system of angles \u03c6 given by a semi-critical structure locally\nprovides a spinor respecting the spin symmetry away from conic singularities:\nDefine half angles \u03b8 on oriented edges of \u03a5 in the following way: Each edge\n\u2032\n(\u03be, \u03be \u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a51 cuts an edge a \u2208 \u039b1 , set \u03b8(\u03be, \u03be \u2032 ) := \u00b1 \u03c6(a)\n2 whether (\u03be, \u03be ) turns in the\npositive or negative direction around the diamond. Choose a base point \u03be0 \u2208 \u03a50\u2032 ,\ndefine \u03b6 by \u03b6(\u03be0 ) = 1 and\nX\n\u03b6(\u03be) := exp i\n\u03b8(\u03bb)\n(4.4)\n\u03bb\u2208\u03b3\n\nfor any path \u03b3 from \u03be0 to \u03be. The sum of the half angles are equal to \u03c0 around the\nfaces of \u2666 and half the conic angle around a vertex, so if it is a regular flat point,\nwe get 2\u03c0\n2 = \u03c0 again, hence \u03b6 is a well defined spinor. As diagonals of the faces of\n\u2666 are orthogonal, \u03b6 fulfills the spin symmetry. Moreover, if the conic angles are\ncongruous to 2\u03c0 modulo 4\u03c0, \u03b6 can be extended to any simply connected region;\nif the fundamental group acts by translations, \u03b6 is defined on the whole \u03a5 \u2032 .\nWe are going to define a propagation equation which comes from the Ising\nmodel. It is fulfilled by the fermion defined by Kaufman [K] which is known to\nconverge to a Dirac spinor near criticality. We will use the definition \u03c8 = \u03c3\u03bc\ngiven by Kadanoff and Ceva [KC]. The Dirac equation has a long history in\nthe Ising model, beginning with the work of Kaufman [K] and Onsager and\nKaufman [KO], we refer among others to [McCW81,SMJ,KC]. The equation\nthat we need is defined explicitly in [DD], hence we will name it the Dotsenko\nequation, even though it might be found elsewhere in other forms. It is fulfilled\nby the fermion at criticality as well as off criticality. But this equation is only a\npart of the full Dirac equation.

Of course, d\u03b6\u0304\u03b6 \u2032 is anti-holomorphic. Conversely, if d\u03a5 \u03b6\u03b6 \u2032\nis holomorphic with \u03b6 a Dirac spinor, then \u03b6 \u2032 fulfills the Dotsenko equation.\nGiven\na holomorphic R1-form \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9 (1,0) (\u039b), define \u03b1\u03a5 on \u03a51 by the obvious\nR\nmap ({x,y},{y,x\u2032 }) \u03b1\u03a5 := (x,x\u2032 ) \u03b1. It is a closed 1-form on \u03a5 because \u03b1 is closed\non \u039b, so there exists a function a on any simply connected domain of \u03a50 , unique\nup to an additive constant, such that d\u03a5 a = \u03b1\u03a5 . A check shows that the only\nspinors \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 such that d\u03a5 \u03b6\u03b6 \u2032\u2032 = 0 on \u039b are the one proportional to \u03b6\u0304. It is consistent\nwith the fact that the Dirac spinor is of constant modulus (see Eq. (4.6)). Hence\nthe function \u03b6 \u2032 := a/\u03b6 on \u03a5 \u2032 is the unique spinor (up to a constant times 1/\u03b6 \u223c \u03b6\u0304)\nsuch that d\u03a5 \u03b6\u03b6 \u2032 = \u03b1.\u0003\nNotice that for \u03b6 a Dirac spinor, the holomorphic 1-form associated to it on\n\u039b is locally, for a given flat coordinate Z, d\u03a5 \u03b6\u03b6 = \u03bbdZ, with \u03bb \u2208 C a certain\nconstant.\n\n4.4. Existence of a Dirac spinor.\nTheorem 8. There exists a Dirac spinor on a double map iff it is critical for\na given flat metric with conic angles congruous to 2\u03c0 modulo 4\u03c0 and such that\nthe fundamental group acts by translations. The Dirac spinor is unique up to a\nmultiplicative constant.\nProof 8. Let \u03b6 be a non-zero Dirac spinor. Consider a positively oriented face\n(\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 , \u03be4 ) \u2208 \u03a52 around a diamond with diagonals a, a\u2217 as in Fig. 28, lifted to\nan 8-term cycle\n(\u03be1+ , \u03be2+ , \u03be3+ , \u03be4+ , \u03be1\u2212 , \u03be2\u2212 , \u03be3\u2212 , \u03be4\u2212 ) \u2208 C1 (\u03a5 \u2032 ). The equation\nei\n\n\u03c6(a)\n2\n\n\u03c1(a\u2217 ) + i\n= p\n1 + \u03c1(a\u2217 )2\n\ndefines an angle \u03c6(a) \u2208 (0, \u03c0) for every edge a \u2208 \u039b1 .\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n39\n\nThe Dotsenko and symmetry equations combine into\n\u03c1(a) + i\n\u03b6(\u03be1+ ).\n\u03b6(\u03be2+ ) = p\n1 + \u03c1(a)2\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe fact that \u03b6 is a spinor\nimplies that, summing the four angles around the dia\u2217\nmond, we get ei(\u03c6(a)+\u03c6(a )) = \u22121. As each angle is less than \u03c0, their sum is equal\n\u2032\nP\n)\nto \u03c0. The same consideration around a vertex x \u2208 \u039b0 , yields exp i (x,x\u2032 )\u2208\u039b1 \u03c6(x,x\n=\n2\n\u22121. So \u03c6 is a coherent system of angles and the map is critical with conic angles\ncongruous to 2\u03c0 modulo 4\u03c0.\nConversely, given \u03c6 a coherent system of angles with conic angles congruous\nto 2\u03c0 modulo 4\u03c0, the preceding construction described by Eq. (4.4) gives the\nonly Dirac spinor. \u0003\nIn this case, dZ is a well defined holomorphic 1-form on the whole surface.\nCorollary 9 Let (\u039b, \u03c1) be a discrete conformal structure and\nPP a set of vertices, containing among others the vertices v such that the sum e\u223cv Arctan\u03c1(e),\nsummed over all edges e incident to v, is greater than 2\u03c0. The discrete conformal\nstructure is critical with P as conic singularities if and only if there exist Dirac\nspinors on every simply connected domain containing no point of P .\nWe define in which sense a discrete spinor converges to a continuous spinor.\nWe don't define these spinors on specific spin structures but rather on the universal spin structure S.\nConsider a sequence of finer and finer critical maps such as in Theorem 3.\nChoose a converging sequence of base points (x0k , yk0 ) \u2208 k \u03a50 on each critical map\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\nx0 y 0\n\nsuch that the direction sequence ( d(xk0 ,yk0 ) ) converges to a tangent vector (x0 , v 0 ).\nk\n\nk\n\nConsider a sequence of points (xk , yk ) \u2208 k \u03a50 , defining a sequence of points\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\nx\u2212\nk yk\n.\n(xk ) converging to x in \u03a3 and a converging sequence of directions v = lim d(x\nk ,yk )\nBy compacity of the circle, there exist such sequences for every point x \u2208 \u03a3\nand the criticality implies that it is in at least three directions for flat points,\nseparated by angles less than \u03c0.\nThe different limits allow us to identify, after a certain rank, the relative\nhomology groups H1 (k \u0393 \u2217 \\ x\u2217k , {yk0 , yk })\u2297 Z2 with H1 (\u03a3x , {(x0 , v 0 ), (x, v)})\u2297 Z2 ,\nthe classes of paths in the blown-up of \u03a3 at x0 and x.\nDefinition 12. We will say that a sequence (\u03b6k )k\u2208N of\u0001 spinors converges if and\nonly if, for any converging sequences, (xk , yk ) \u2208 k \u03a50 k\u2208N defining a limit tangent vector, and ([\u03bbk ])k\u2208N of classes of paths in k \u0393 \u2217 from yk0 to y, avoiding the\nface x\u2217k , the sequence of values (\u03b6k (xk , [\u03bbk ])) converges.\nRemark 10. It defines a continuous limit spinor \u03b6 by equivariance: Let x \u2208 \u03a3\u0302,\nthe set Dx of directions in which there exist converging sequences of discrete\ndirections is by definition a closed set. Let u, v two boundary directions of Dx\nsuch that the entire arc A of directions between them is not in Dx . Consider\n[(x, [\u03bb]x ), (x, [\u03bb\u2032 ]x )] \u2282 S a lift of A. The circle S1 acts on the directions, hence on\nthe \u223cx -classes, let \u03c8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) the angle such that (x, ei\u03c8 [\u03bb]x ) = (x, [\u03bb\u2032 ]x ). Define\n\u03b6(x, ei\u03c6 [\u03bb]x ) := eiv(\u03c6) \u03b6(x, [\u03bb]x ),\nwhere v(\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c6 \u03b6(x,[\u03bb\u2032 ]x )\n\u03c8 \u03b6(x,[\u03bb]x )\n\n(v(\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c6\n2\n\nfor Dirac spinors).\n\n\f40\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nTheorem 10. Given a sequence of critical maps such as in Theorem 3 with\nDirac spinors on all of them, they can be normed so that they converge to the\nusual Dirac spinor on the Riemann surface.\nIn a local flat map Z, the square of the discrete Dirac spinor on k \u03a5\u0302 \u2032 is (up to\na multiplicative constant) the 1-form dZ evaluated on the edges. Hence their\nsequence converges.\n4.5. Massive Dirac equation, discrete fusion algebra and conclusions. For completeness and motivation, we describe below the situation off-criticality where\nelliptic integrals come into play, and investigate a form of the discrete fusion\nalgebra in the Ising model. This work was done by Daniel Bennequin and will\nbe the subject of a subsequent article.\nA massive system in the continuous theory is no longer conformal. In the\nsame fashion, Daniel Bennequin defined a massive discrete system of modulus k\nas a discrete double graph (\u039b, \u03c1) such that, for each pair (a, a\u2217 ) of dual edges,\n\u03c1(a)\u03c1(a\u2217 ) =\n\n1\n.\nk\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe massless case corresponds to k = 1. We showed that criticality was\nequivalent to a coherent system of angles \u03c6(a) such as shown in Fig. 8, defined\nby tan \u03c6(a)\n2 = \u03c1(a), and adding up to 2\u03c0 at each vertex of the double, except at\nconic singularities. The Dirac spinor was constructed using the half angles \u03c6(a)\n2 .\nSimilarly, for every edge, we define the massive \"half angle\" u(a) as the elliptic\nintegral\nZ \u03c6(a)\n2\nd\u03c6\nu(a) :=\n,\n(4.8)\n\u2206\u2032 (\u03c6)\n0\nwhere the measure is deformed by\n2\n\nk 2 + k \u2032 = 1,\nq\n\u2206(\u03c6) := 1 \u2212 k 2 sin2 \u03c6,\nq\n\u2206\u2032 (\u03c6) := 1 \u2212 k \u2032 2 sin2 \u03c6.\n\n(4.9)\n(4.10)\n(4.11)\n\nUsing these non-circular half angles, and the corresponding \"square angle\"\nR\u03c0\nIk\u2032 := 02 \u2206d\u03c6\n\u2032 (\u03c6) , one can construct a massive Dirac spinor wherever the following\n\"flatness\" condition is fulfilled:\nX\n(4.12)\n(Ik\u2032 \u2212 u(a)) = Ik\u2032 mod 4Ik\u2032 for each face F \u2208 \u039b2 ,\na\u2208\u2202F\n\nX\na\u220bv\n\n(u(a)) = Ik\u2032\n\nmod 4Ik\u2032 for each vertex v \u2208 \u039b0 .\n\n(4.13)\n\nDaniel Bennequin noticed that the fusion algebra of the Ising model could be\nunderstood at the finite level: Consider a trinion made of cylinders of a square\nlattice, of width m and n, glued into a cylinder of width m+n. It has been known\n\n\fDiscrete Riemann Surfaces\n\n41\n\nsince Kaufman [K] that, in the transfer matrix description of the Ising model,\nthe configuration space of the Ising model on each of the three boundaries is a\nrepresentation of spin groups spin(m), spin(n) and spin(m + n) respectively. If m\nis odd, there exists a unique irreducible representation \u2206 of spin(m) but when\nm is even, there are two irreducible representations, \u2206+ and \u2206\u2212 . A pair of pants\ngives us a map spin(m) \u00d7 spin(n) \u2192 spin(m + n), in the case of a pair of pants of\nheight zero, it's the inclusion given by the usual product. The representations of\nspin(m + n) induce representations of the product group that can be split into\nirreducible representations. If the three numbers are even,\n\u2206+ \u2192 \u2206+ \u2297 \u2206+ + \u2206\u2212 \u2297 \u2206\u2212 ,\n\u2206\u2212 \u2192 \u2206+ \u2297 \u2206\u2212 + \u2206\u2212 \u2297 \u2206+ ,\n\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n(4.16)\n\nwhile if only one of them is even,\n\u2206 \u2192 \u2206+ \u2297 \u2206 + \u2206\u2212 \u2297 \u2206,\n\n(4.17)\n(4.18)\n\nand if m and n are both odd,\n\u2206+ \u2192 \u2206 \u2297 \u2206,\n\u2206\u2212 \u2192 \u2206 \u2297 \u2206.\n\n(4.19)\n(4.20)\n\nLet us compile these data in an array and relabel \u2206 by \u03c3, \u2206+ by 1 and \u2206\u2212 by\n\u01eb:\n1 \u01eb \u03c3\n1 1 \u01eb \u03c3\n.\n(4.21)\n\u01eb \u01eb 1 \u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 1+\u01eb\nThis is read as follows, the 1 + \u01eb in the slot \u03c3 \u2297 \u03c3 for example, means that the\nrepresentation 1 and the representation \u01eb of spin(m + n) both induce a factor\n\u03c3 \u2297 \u03c3 in the representation in the product group spin(m) \u00d7 spin(n).\nWe get exactly the fusion rules of the Ising model. The only difference compared with the continuous case is that the algebra is not closed at a finite level.\nThe columns, rows and entries are not representations of the same group, rather\nwe have a product of representations of spin(n) and spin(m) as a factor of a\nrepresentation of spin(n + m).\nThese results provide evidence that a discrete conformal field theory might\nbe looked for: the discrete Dirac spinor at criticality is the discrete version of\nthe conformal block associated with the field \u03a8 and some sort of fusion algebra\ncan be identified at the finite level. The program we contemplate is, first to\ninvestigate other statistical models and see if there are such patterns. If that is\nthe case, we must then mimic in the discrete setup the vertex operator algebra\nof the continuous conformal theory. This can be attempted by defining a discrete\noperator algebra, in a similar fashion to Kadanoff and Ceva [KC], and splitting\nthis algebra according to its discrete holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts.\nThe hope is that some aspects of the powerful results and techniques defined by\nBelavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov [BPZ] will still hold. A very interesting\nissue would be, as we have done for the Ising model, to realize the fusion rules\nof a theory in the discrete setup, yielding its Verlinde algebra.\n\n\f42\n\nChristian Mercat\n\nAcknowledgements.
