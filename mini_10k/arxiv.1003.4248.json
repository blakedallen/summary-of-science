Thus, at least in the semiclassical limit, he proposes that the mathematical form of the\narea spectrum is\nAn = \u01eb~n,\n(1)\nwhere n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ~ stands for the reduced Planck constant, and \u01eb is a dimensionless parameter of order\n1. It is believed that a quantum theory of gravity allows us to determine the value of the parameter \u01eb (in the\ncase that the quantum theory confirms that the area spectrum of the black hole horizon takes the form (1)).\nAt present time we do not know a complete quantum theory of gravity. Nevertheless, supposing that the\narea spectrum is of the form (1) and using different semiclassical methods we can calculate the parameter \u01eb\n(see [5]\u2013[34] for some examples). In the previous references, for the parameter \u01eb often are found the values\n\u01eb = 8\u03c0 and \u01eb = 4 ln(j), with j = 2, 3, . . . .\nWe note that several methods used to calculate the area spectrum produce the value \u01eb = 8\u03c0 [1, 2, 13, 15],\n[17]\u2013[22] and for black hole horizons Medved proposes that this value for \u01eb is universal [16]. Nevertheless,\nassuming a strict statistical interpretation of the black hole entropy, Bekenstein and Mukhanov find that the\nparameter \u01eb must be equal to \u01eb = 4 ln(j) [5, 6]. In an interesting proposal Hod uses the Bohr correspondence\nprinciple and the real part of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies (QNF) to determine the value of the\ninteger j [7]. Briefly, Hod proposes that for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole the emission of a\nquantum produces a change in the black hole mass given by\n\u2206M = ~\u03c9R ,\n\u2217 alopezo@ipn.mx\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9R stands for the real part of the asymptotic QNF.1 From the known value of \u03c9R for the fourdimensional Schwarzschild black hole [35]\u2013[37] Hod finds j = 3 [7]. Based on these ideas, Kunstatter expounds\na different method to get equivalent results for the area quantum to those by Hod [8], at least for some\nspacetimes. For the results on the area spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole that produces the\noriginal Hod's conjecture see [10]\u2013[12].\nAlthough Hod's conjecture works for Schwarzschild black holes some difficulties arise when it is used in\nother black holes. For example, for the four-dimensional Kerr black hole it is expected a discrete and equally\nspaced area spectrum [1]\u2013[4], [38], however based on Hod's conjecture Setare and Vagenas find a discrete\nbut not equally spaced area spectrum [9]. Also it is known that the real part of the asymptotic QNF is not\nuniversal, that is, the real part of the asymptotic QNF may depend on the black hole type or even on the\nfield type [35]\u2013[37], [39, 40].\nSupposing that the quasinormal modes of a black hole can be described as the oscillations of a damped\noscillator and taking into account Hod's conjecture, Maggiore [19] proposes that in the semiclassical limit the\narea spectrum of the event horizon is determined by the asymptotic value of the so-called physical frequency\ndefined by\nq\n\u03c9p,k =\n\n2 + \u03c92,\n\u03c9R\nI\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c9I stands for the imaginary part of the asymptotic QNF. Making this change and using a similar\nmethod to that proposed by Hod [7], Maggiore finds that for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole\nits area spectrum takes the form (1) with \u01eb = 8\u03c0. This result for \u01eb coincides with the value calculated by\nother methods [15]\u2013[18].\nThe consequences of Maggiore's proposal have been studied in several spacetimes [20]\u2013[34]. Based on\nthe ideas by Hod, Kunstatter, and Maggiore, we calculate the area quantum of the d-dimensional ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit (d \u2265 4). We follow the methods already used for the slowly\nrotating four-dimensional Kerr black hole [21, 22]. Thus for the area spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole our calculation is an update of the results obtained with the original Hod's conjecture [10]\u2013[12].\nWe also extend the result to non extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we calculate the area quantum of the d-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black hole. Our main objective in Section 2 is to explain the methods that we shall use in the\nremainder of the paper. Using Hod-Maggiore and Kunstatter-Maggiore methods in Section 3 we calculate\nthe area quantum of the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit and then with\nother method we extend the results to the non extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. We also compare\nour results with those already published. Finally in Section 4 we summarize the obtained results.\n\n2\n\nArea spectrum of the Schwarzschild black hole\n\nUsing the ideas by Hod, Kunstatter, and Maggiore [7, 8, 19] in the following section we shall calculate\nthe quantum of area for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit. For\nillustrative purposes in this section we expound a similar calculation for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild\nblack hole. As far as we know this computation does not appear in the literature, but it follows from the\ncalculation for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in a straightforward way [19, 20].\nNotice that in this paper to calculate the area spectra we do not use the original Hod's conjecture [7]. Our\nmain motivation to use Maggiore's proposal are the examples of spacetimes whose QNF are purely imaginary\n[28] and therefore for their horizons Hod's conjecture predicts a continuous area spectrum. Thus our aim is\nto investigate the predictions for the area spectra of the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes\nthat produce the modifications proposed by Maggiore [19].\nThe d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole whose metric takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n2\u03bc\n2\u03bc\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a32d\u22122 ,\n(4)\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212 d\u22123 dt2 + 1 \u2212 d\u22123\nr\nr\n1 This\n\nproposal is usually known as Hod's conjecture.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere d\u03a32d\u22122 stands for the line element of the (d \u2212 2)-dimensional unit sphere, the parameter \u03bc is related\nto the mass M of the Schwarzschild black hole by (see Appendix A of [39])\nM=\n\n(d \u2212 2)\u03a9d\u22122\n\u03bc,\n8\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03a9d\u22122 denoting the area of an unit (d \u2212 2)-dimensional sphere\n\u03a9d\u22122 =\n\n2\u03c0 (d\u22121)/2\n.\n\u0393( d\u22121\n2 )\n\n(6)\n\nWe also note that for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole the area of its event horizon is given by\nd\u22122\nA = \u03a9d\u22122 r+\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere r+ is the radius of its event horizon, r+ = (2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123) .\nIn order to exploit the ideas by Hod, Kunstatter, and Maggiore to calculate the area and entropy quanta\nof the black hole under study, we need to know exactly the QNF or at least its asymptotic limit [7, 8, 19].\nFor the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole the asymptotic QNF of the gravitational perturbations are\nequal to [35, 36, 37, 39, 41]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u22123\n1\nd\u22123\n, k \u2208 N, k \u2192 \u221e.\n(8)\nln(3) + i\nk+\n\u03c9=\n2\n4\u03c0(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\nFrom the previous formula we get that for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole the physical frequency\n(3) is\nd\u22123\n\u03c9p,k =\nk.\n(9)\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\nWe shall use two methods to calculate the area quantum from the asymptotic QNF. The first method\nis based on the ideas by Hod [7] and Maggiore [19]. This method works as follows. Based on Hod's ideas,\nMaggiore proposes that the mass of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole changes in discrete steps\ndetermined by [19]\n\u2206M = ~\u2206\u03c9,\n(10)\nwhere \u2206\u03c9 is equal to\n\u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9p,k+1 \u2212 \u03c9p,k =\n\nd\u22123\n,\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\n\n(11)\n\nwith d = 4. We propose that formula (10) is valid for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and taking\ninto account formulas (5), (6), and (7) we find that a small change in the mass of the Schwarzschild black\nhole produces a change in its horizon area given by\n\u2206A =\n\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\n8\u03c0\u2206M.\nd\u22123\n\n(12)\n\nUsing formulas (10) and (11) we find that the area quantum of the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black\nhole is\n\u2206A = 8\u03c0~.\n(13)\nThus \u01eb = 8\u03c0 for this black hole and from the Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy relation [42] we obtain the\nentropy quantum\n\u2206S = 2\u03c0.\n(14)\nThe second method that we shall use to calculate the area quantum of the event horizon is based on the\nideas by Kunstatter [8] and Maggiore [19]. This method works as follows. First we note that for a system\nwith energy E and oscillation frequency \u03c9 the quantity\nZ\ndE\nI=\n(15)\n\u03c9\n3\n\n\fis an adiabatic invariant [8]. Furthermore we recall that in the semiclassical limit Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule states that the adiabatic invariant I has an equally spaced spectrum, thus I = n~, n \u2208 N [8]. From\nthese facts and taking into account the ideas by Kunstatter [8] and Maggiore [19], it is proposed that for\nthe calculation of the area spectrum the quantity \u2206\u03c9 of formula (11) is the appropriate oscillation frequency\n[21]. Thus for the Schwarzschild black hole we need to calculate the adiabatic invariant [8, 20, 21]\nZ\ndM\n.\n(16)\nI=\n\u2206\u03c9\nFor the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole we get\nI\n\n=\n\n(d\u22122)/(d\u22123)\n\u03a9d\u22122\nd\u22122 2\nd\u22123\n8\u03c0\n\nR\n\n\u03bc1/(d\u22123) d\u03bc =\n\nA\n8\u03c0 .\n\n(17)\n\nHence, Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule and the previous expression for I imply that in the semiclassical\nlimit the area spectrum of the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole takes the form\nAn = 8\u03c0~n.\n\n(18)\n\nFrom this expression for the area spectrum we find the area quantum \u2206A of formula (13) (and therefore the\nentropy quantum \u2206S of expression (14)). Thus for the Schwarzschild black hole the two methods produce\nidentical values for \u2206A and \u2206S.\nWe notice that expression (13) for the area quantum and formula (14) for the entropy quantum of\nthe d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole are equal to those previously obtained for the four-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black hole [19], [20]. Thus for the Schwarzschild black hole the area and entropy quanta are\nindependent of the spacetime dimension.\nAt this point we note that in the method based on Hod [7] and Maggiore [19] proposals the area spectrum\nof the event horizon has the mathematical form (1), that is, a discrete and equally spaced area spectrum is\nassumed and the method gives us the value of the area quantum. In contrast the method based on ideas by\nKunstatter [8] and Maggiore [19] produces a mathematical expression for the area spectrum and the value\nfor the area quantum is a by product.\n\n3\n\nArea spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\n\nIn this section we use Hod's conjecture [7] with the changes suggested by Maggiore [19] to calculate the\narea quantum of the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit and then with\na different method we extend these results to non extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. Hence for the\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole we revise and update some results obtained with the original Hod's proposal\n[10]\u2013[12]. Our calculation for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit is\nsimilar to that for the slowly rotating four-dimensional Kerr black hole [21, 22].\nThe d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole whose metric is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n2\u03bc\n2\u03bc\nq2\nq2\n2\n2\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a32d\u22122 ,\n(19)\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212 d\u22123 + 2(d\u22123) dt + 1 \u2212 d\u22123 + 2(d\u22123)\nr\nr\nr\nr\nwhere we define d\u03a32d\u22122 as in the previous section, the parameters \u03bc and q are related to the ADM mass M\nand electric charge Q of the black hole by the expressions [39]\n\u03bc=\n\n8\u03c0\nM,\n\u03a9d\u22122 (d \u2212 2)\n\nq2 =\n\n2\nQ2 ,\n(d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3)\n\n(20)\n\nwith \u03a9d\u22122 already defined in formula (6).\nFor the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the area of its event horizon A and its electrostatic\npotential at the horizon \u03a6+ are\nd\u22122\nA = \u03a9d\u22122 r+\n,\n\n\u03a6+ =\n\n4\n\n\u03a9d\u22122 Q\n,\nd\u22123\n4\u03c0(d \u2212 3)r+\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere r+ stands for the radius of the event horizon\nd\u22123\nr+\n= \u03bc+\n\np\n\u03bc2 \u2212 q 2 .\n\nWe note that the radius of the inner horizon is determined by\np\nd\u22123\nr\u2212\n= \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212 q 2 .\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nFirst we focus on the area quantum of the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small\ncharge limit, thus, we assume that q \u226a \u03bc. Our main reasons are\n1. It is believed that extreme and near extreme black holes are highly quantum objects [14, 15, 38, 43],\ntherefore we think that the semiclassical methods explained in the previous section are not useful for\nextreme or near extreme black holes.\n2. In the small charge limit there is an explicit formula for the asymptotic QNF of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole (see formula (3.20) of [44]). Generally the asymptotic QNF of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole are given implicitly [36, 37, 39, 44].\nFor the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit the asymptotic QNF of\nthe coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations reduce to [44]\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0001\ni(d\u22123)\nd\u22123\nd\u22123\n3 + 4 cos 2d\u22125\nk + 12 ,\n\u03c0 + 2(2\u03bc)\n(24)\n\u03c9 = 4\u03c0(2\u03bc)\n1/(d\u22123) ln\n1/(d\u22123)\n\nwith k \u2208 N, k \u2192 \u221e. It is convenient to comment that the asymptotic QNF (24) do not correspond to those\nfor the Schwarzschild black hole (8) as the electric charge goes to zero. In the zero charge limit the difference\nbetween (8) and (24) is in the logarithm term of the real part for the asymptotic QNF. For example, when\nd = 4 in the result for Schwarzschild appears the factor ln(3) while in the result for Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m the\ncorresponding factor is ln(5). In [44] it is shown that this fact is due to an discrete change in the topology\nof the Stokes lines used in the computation when the damping of the QNF for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole increases.\nFurthermore in [44] evidence is presented that for the asymptotic QNF of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole when we increase the damping there is a range such that the real part varies from the Schwarzschild\nvalue to near zero and then the real part goes to the value for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole given in\n(24). Since we only use the methods with the modifications proposed by Maggiore for our problem this fact\ndoes not change the analysis, because we must calculate the physical frequency in the limit k \u2192 \u221e and in\nthis case the real part of the asymptotic QNF becomes negligible and hence its variation does not change\nin an appreciable way the value of the physical frequency. Moreover notice that the imaginary part of the\nasymptotic QNF is continuous when we go from the asymptotic QNF for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\nto those for the Schwarzschild black hole.\nFrom the asymptotic QNF (24) we get the quantity \u2206\u03c9 corresponding to the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole in the small charge limit is\nd\u22123\n,\n(25)\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\nand as for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole we propose that formula (10) is valid for the ddimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole (for the four-dimensional Kerr black hole see [21, 22]). Hence\nfrom formulas (10) and (20) we find\n~(d \u2212 3)\n.\n(26)\n\u2206M =\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\nTaking into account the first formula of (21) we obtain that, in the small charge limit, a small variation\nin the mass produces a change in the horizon area of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole equal to\n1/(d\u22123)\n\u2206A \u2248 \u03a9d\u22122 d\u22122\n2\u2206\u03bc \u2248\nd\u22123 (2\u03bc)\n\n2(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123)\n8\u03c0\u2206M,\nd\u22123\n\n(27)\n\nand using formula (26) we get that the area quantum of the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in\nthe small charge limit is \u2206A = 8\u03c0~ (and hence \u01eb = 8\u03c0).\n5\n\n\fAlso, to calculate the area quantum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit we can\nuse the second method explained in the previous section. To leading order, that is, keeping terms of order\n(q/2\u03bc)2 in the calculation, we note that in the small charge limit the area of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m event\nhorizon is approximately\nA \u2248 \u03a9d\u22122 (2\u03bc)(d\u22122)/(d\u22123) \u2212 \u03a9d\u22122\n\nd\u22122\nq2\n.\n(d\u22124)/(d\u22123)\nd \u2212 3 (2\u03bc)\n\n(28)\n\nFollowing Vagenas [21] and Medved [22] we propose that for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the\nadiabatic invariant I of expression (16) transforms into\nZ\ndM \u2212 \u03a6+ dQ\n,\n(29)\nI=\n\u2206\u03c9\n(see also [9, 28, 34]). To leading order we find that for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge\nlimit the adiabatic invariant (29) becomes\nI\n\n=\n\n(d\u22122)\u03a9d\u22122\n4\u03c0(d\u22123)\n\n\u2248\n\nR\n\n(2\u03bc)1/(d\u22123) d\u03bc \u2212\n\n\u03a9d\u22122\n(d\u22122)/(d\u22123)\n8\u03c0 (2\u03bc)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03a9d\u22122 2(d\u22122)/(d\u22123)\n8\u03c0(d\u22123)2 \u03bc(d\u22124)/(d\u22123)\n2\n\nR\n\nQdQ\n\n\u03a9d\u22122 d\u22122\nq\n8\u03c0 d\u22123 (2\u03bc)(d\u22124)/(d\u22123) .\n\n(30)\n\nComparing formulas (28) and (30) we find that in the small charge limit\nI\u2248\n\nA\n,\n8\u03c0\n\n(31)\n\nand from Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule we get that for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole in the small charge limit its area spectrum to leading order is An \u2248 8\u03c0~n. Therefore, to leading order,\nthe area quantum that we get with the second method is identical to that previously calculated.\nAs we comment at the end of Section 2, the first method that we use previously gives the value for the\narea quantum, while the second method produces an expression for the area spectrum. Doubtless, in the\nframework of the Kunstatter method, it is convenient to find the expression of the area spectrum when we\nkept higher order terms in the expansion in (q/2\u03bc) already used. Keeping terms of order (q/2\u03bc)4 , we find\nthat for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit the area of its event horizon is (compare\nwith (28))\n2\n\nq\nA \u2248 \u03a9d\u22122 (2\u03bc)(d\u22122)/(d\u22123) \u2212 \u03a9d\u22122 d\u22122\nd\u22123 (2\u03bc)(d\u22124)/(d\u22123)\n4\n\nq\nd\u22122 2d\u22127\n\u2212 \u03a9d\u22122\n2 d\u22123 d\u22123 (2\u03bc)(3d\u221210)/(d\u22123) .\n\n(32)\n\nIn a similar way, to the same order in (q/2\u03bc), we get that the adiabatic invariant I (29) is\nI\n\n\u2248\n\n1\n(d\u22122)/(d\u22123)\n8\u03c0 \u03a9d\u22122 (2\u03bc)\n1\n\u2212 8\u03c0\n\n\u2212\n\nq2\n1\nd\u22122\n8\u03c0 \u03a9d\u22122 d\u22123 (2\u03bc)(d\u22124)/(d\u22123)\n\n\u03a9d\u22122 d\u22122\nq4\n2 d\u22123 (2\u03bc)(3d\u221210)/(d\u22123) .\n\n(33)\n\nFrom these expressions we obtain that to this order the area of the event horizon A and the adiabatic\ninvariant I do not satisfy (31). Thus to higher order and with the approximations that we use to find\nexpression (33), we get that Kunstatter-Maggiore method predicts that for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole in the small charge limit its area spectrum does not grow linearly. Hence to leading order it is true\nthat both methods give the same area quantum, but to higher order, Kunstatter method does not predict\nan equally space area spectrum and therefore the area quantum that it gives is different from that produces\nthe first method.2 For the already studied slowly rotating four dimensional Kerr black hole [21], [22], [33]\nwe guess that only to leading order the two methods used to calculate the area quantum produce the same\nvalue.\n2I\n\nthank to Referee for suggesting this analysis.\n\n6\n\n\fWe note that in the calculation of the expressions (32) and (33) for the area and the quantity I we expand\nto order (q/2\u03bc)4 the factor (1 \u2212 q 2 /\u03bc2 )1/2 , but we use the physical frequency given in formula (25). It is\nconvenient to calculate the corrections of the asymptotic QNF for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, and\nuse these to find a new expression for the adiabatic invariant I, in order to determine whether it satisfies\nrelation (31).\nThus, to leading order, for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit its\narea quantum is equal to that of the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. As for the Schwarzschild black\nhole, to leading order the Hod-Maggiore and Kunstatter-Maggiore methods yield that the area quantum of\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit does not depend on the spacetime dimension.\nMoreover, for these two black holes the two methods that we have used to calculate their area spectra to\nleading order produce identical results.\nFrom our results we point out that for the Schwarzschild black hole and the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole in the small charge limit, the area and entropy spectra are equally spaced to leading order, but we point\nout that there are black holes for which their entropy spectra are evenly spaced but not their area spectra\n[20, 26].\nNotice that when we use the first method (see formula (27)) we implicitly assume that the change in\nthe horizon area is determined by the change in the mass of the black hole, and thus we ignore the changes\nin the other parameters (and the changes that these produce in the horizon area). In particular for the\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole we assume that the electric charge does not change or its change is much\nsmaller than that of the mass.\nRecently Kwon and Nam propose that the appropriate adiabatic invariant to be quantized is similar to\nthat of the Schwarzschild black hole (see formula (16)), even for charged and rotating black holes, in contrast\nto the proposals by Vagenas [21], Medved [22], and of formula (29). For the three-dimensional spinning\nBTZ black hole they find that the addition and subtraction of the areas for the outer and inner horizons\nare quantized. Using the method described in [31], Kwon and Nam [45] analyze the case of the ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole and they obtain a result consistent with that presented above for the area quantum in\nthe small charge limit.\nIt is convenient to comment that in [45] are quantized the surface areas of the event and inner horizons for\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, similar to the proposal by Makela and Repo [46] and the results obtained\nwith the original Hod's conjecture [11], [12]. Furthermore we note that in the process of quantization, Kwon\nand Nam [45] propose that we must consider on equal basis the quasinormal modes, the total transmission\nmodes, and the total reflection modes, but in their calculation of the area spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole they only consider the total transmission modes and the total reflection modes, thus in their computation they do not take into account the QNM, because for the coupled electromagnetic and gravitational\nperturbations an explicit expression for the asymptotic QNF is not known (except in the small charge limit).\nNevertheless for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the asymptotic QNF of the uncharged massless Dirac\nfield can be determined in explicit form. For the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the asymptotic QNF of the Dirac field are calculated by Cho in [47] (see formula (55) of [47]). We note that in the\nd-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the Dirac equation simplifies to a pair of Schr\u00f6dinger type\nequations with effective potentials [48]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03bc\nq2\n1\n\u2212\n+\nV\u00b1 = \u2212\u03ba2\nr2\nrd\u22121\nr2d\u22124\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nq2\n\u03bc(d \u2212 1) q 2 (d \u2212 2)\n2\u03bc\n\u2212 2+\n,\n(34)\n\u2212\n\u2213 i\u03ba 1 \u2212 d\u22123 + 2d\u22126\nr\nr\nr\nrd\u22121\nr2d\u22124\nwhere \u03ba is related to the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on the (d\u22122)\u2212dimensional sphere. From expressions\n(34) for the effective potentials we get\nlim V\u00b1 = 0,\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nlim V\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1\n\nr\u21920\n\n\u03b1\nx1+(d\u22122)/(2d\u22125)\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwith \u03b1 a constant and x is the tortoise coordinate of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole.\nHence we can use the results of [36], [39] to find that in the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\n\n7\n\n\fthe asymptotic QNF of the Dirac field are determined by formula (3.20) of [39] with j = 1.3 Thus for d \u2265 4\nthe asymptotic QNF of the Dirac field are\n\u03c9 = i\u03ba+ k\n(36)\nwhere\nd\u22123\n\u03ba+ =\n2r+\n\n1\u2212\n\nd\u22123\nr\u2212\nd\u22123\nr+\n\n!\n\n(37)\n\nis the surface gravity of the event horizon for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. Notice that the asymptotic\nQNF (36) are purely imaginary and in contrast to QNF (24) these are not restricted to the small charge\nlimit.\nFrom (36) for the Dirac field we obtain that the step in the physical frequency is \u2206\u03c9 = \u03ba+ . Following\nKwon and Nam [31], [45], instead the adiabatic invariant (29) in what follows we consider the quantity\nZ\ndM\nIKN =\n.\n(38)\n\u2206\u03c9\np\nMaking the change of variable u = \u03bc + \u03bc2 \u2212 q 2 we find that the value of the previous integral is\nIKN =\n\nd\u22122\n\u03a9d\u22122 r+\nA\n=\n.\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n\n(39)\n\nAccording to the proposal by Kwon and Nam in the semiclassical limit IKN has an equally spaced spectrum\nof the form IKN = n~. Hence we obtain that for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole the area\nquantum of its event horizon is \u2206A = 8\u03c0~ which is consistent with that already obtained. It is convenient to\nremark that this result is valid for the non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes and it is not restricted\nto the small charge limit.\nNotice that Kwon and Nam state that IKN (38) is an action variable and therefore in the proposal by\nKunstatter and Maggiore it is the physical quantity that must be quantized. We believe that for the quantity\nIKN another interpretation is possible. The quantity IKN is quantized when we assume that the changes in\nthe charge or angular momentum of the black hole are neglected and hence only the changes in the mass are\nrelevant. From this viewpoint the previous result that we obtain for the Dirac field deserves additional study.\nBased on his conjecture [7], Hod studies the area spectrum of the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole [11, 12]. Taking into account the existence of two distinct families for the asymptotic QNF of the\ncharged Klein-Gordon field (see formulas (5) and (6) of [12]), he finds that a family of QNF leads to an area\nquantum equal to \u2206A = 4~ ln(2) for the surface area of the event horizon, whereas the second family of QNF\nleads to an area quantum equal to \u2206A = 4~ ln(3) for the total surface area (the area of the outer horizon\nplus the surface area of the inner horizon). The last result reminds us the proposal by Makela and Repo [46],\nwho suggest that for a multihorizon black hole the object that must be quantized in equal steps is the total\narea of the horizons.\nNotice that, in the small charge limit, formulas (5) and (6) of [12] lead to the same physical frequency\nand using the previous methods we get that, in the small charge limit, both families of asymptotic QNF lead\nto the same result for the area quantum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m event horizon in four dimensions.\nIt is convenient to comment that for the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole with d \u2265 4, the additional\ndimensions are included in the term d\u03a32d\u22122 of the metric (19) and we can expect that to leading order\nthe result for the area quantum does not depend on the dimension of the spacetime because the additional\ndimensions are \"hidden\". We believe that the problem is not straightforward, because the (t, r) sector of\nthe metric for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole depends on the dimension of the metric (for\nexample see the factor 2\u03bc/rd\u22123 ). Similar comments are valid for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole.\nIn [10], [14, 15, 17, 46] we find other results on the area spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\n(mainly in four dimensions). Setare [10] analyzes the four-dimensional extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole. Thus [10] and the present paper study different limits of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solution and it is not\npossible to compare the obtained results for the area quantum. Also in [10] it is not shown that the area of the\nextreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole behaves as an adiabatic invariant and it is expected that the extreme\n3 This\n\nparameter j is different from that used in Section 1.\n\n8\n\n\fReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole is a quantum object. Thus it is not straightforward that the Bekenstein and\nHod ideas can be used to calculate the area quantum of the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole.\nIn the small charge limit the area of the inner horizon is small and the total area is approximately the\narea of the event horizon, thus we may say that our results do not distinguish whether the total area or\nthe event horizon surface is quantized; nevertheless we note that in the second method, to leading order we\nidentify the area of the event horizon with the value of the integral for the adiabatic invariant I (29) of the\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole (see also (39)) and hence we implicitly quantize the area of the outer horizon,\nand not the total area.\nBased on reduced phase-space quantization Barvinsky, et al. [14] calculate the area spectrum of the\nd-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole (and other charged black holes). In [14] it is quantized the\nquantity AB = A \u2212 A0 , where A is the area of the event horizon, A0 is a function that depends on a positive\npower of the electric charge and is related to the horizon area of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black\nhole. In the small charge limit we can assume that A0 is small and hence AB \u2248 A. For the four-dimensional\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole they find the two parameter area spectrum [14] (a similar area spectrum is\nfound for the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole)\nAB = 4\u03c0~(2n + p + 1),\n\n(40)\n\u221a\nwhere n, p = 0, 1, 2, . . . , with p determining the charge spectrum Q = \u00b1 ~p. From formula (40), if Q is a\nconstant, then \u2206AB = 8\u03c0~, which is equal to our result. Thus in the small charge limit and for constant Q,\nour results to leading order are equal to those by Barvinsky, et al. [14]. Moreover the area quantum that we\nget with the Kwon and Nam proposal is identical to \u2206AB . In contrast to the method of Barvinsky, et al.\n[14] the methods that we use in this paper do not determine the charge spectrum of the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\nblack hole.\nA similar analysis to that of Barvinsky, et al. [14] is developed by Ropotenko [17] and Medved [15] for\nblack holes whose metric can be written in Schwarzschild like form. In particular, for the area spectrum of\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole they find An = 8\u03c0~n. To leading order our result for the area quantum\nin the small charge limit coincides with the value which is reported in [15, 17], and the area spectrum that\nwe get with the Kwon and Nam proposal is identical to that given in [15, 17].\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nFrom the results of [19]\u2013[22] and from those of the previous sections, (for the d-dimensional Schwarzschild\nblack hole, the d-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit (to leading order), and\nthe slowly rotating four-dimensional Kerr black hole) we obtain that their area quanta are equal to \u2206A = 8\u03c0~\nand coincide with the results for \u2206A already calculated [15]\u2013[18]. At least to leading order, notice that this\nvalue of the area quantum is independent of the black hole parameters, the spacetime dimension, and the\nfield parameters. We also note that for these three black holes, to leading order the two methods used in\n[19]\u2013[22] and in the previous sections give the same value for the area quantum.\nIn contrast to original Hod's conjecture [7], the previous results show that Hod's conjecture with the\nchanges suggested by Maggiore [19] is applicable to black holes with two horizons, at least far from the\nextremal limit (see the examples of the slowly rotating four-dimensional Kerr black hole [21], [22], the ddimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit to leading order and of the non extremal\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole). Thus for the black holes of Einstein-Maxwell theory, it is probable that\nfor the dimensionless parameter \u01eb of formula (1) the value \u01eb = 8\u03c0 is generic (at least in some limit) as is\nsuggested by Medved [16].\nHere for the non extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes we expand the analysis proposed by Kwon and\nNam. Furthermore with the methods of Hod-Maggiore and Kunstatter-Maggiore we analyze the ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m black hole in the small charge limit. A question that deserves further research is to study whether\nthe Hod-Maggiore and Kunstatter-Maggiore methods of the previous sections can be used when we eliminate\nthis restriction on the mass and charge, but the black hole is still far from extremality. Notice that for this\ncase in Kunstatter-Maggiore method the corrections of higher order must be considered.\n\n9\n\n\f5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by CONACYT M\u00e9xico, SNI M\u00e9xico, EDI-IPN, COFAA-IPN, and Research Projects\nSIP-20100777 and SIP-20100684.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bekenstein J D 1974 Lett.
