The advection of density\nfluctuations plays a central role, suppressing the caging of particles and speeding up structural\nrelaxation. A mode coupling approach is developed to explore these effects.\nPACS numbers: 82.70.Dd, 83.60.Df, 83.50.Ax, 64.70.Pf, 83.10.-y\n\nThe properties of dispersions under flow are central to\ntheir processing and technological use [1, 2]. But especially the non-linear rheology is not yet well understood.\nFor the simplest case of steady shearing, the low density\nbehavior is known [3], but upon increasing the density the\ngrowing importance of particle interactions requires theoretical approximation [4, 5], hinders simulations [6], and\ncalls for studies of model systems, e.g. [7, 8]. Of major\ninterest is the arrest of the structural relaxation when approaching solidification for higher densities, which raises\nthe question of how the imposition of steady shearing\nmight interfere with glass formation. The linear phenomenology is familiar: a colloidal fluid possesses a viscosity and flows, while a colloidal glass characterized by\nelastic constants, only distorts under strain [1, 2]. But\nthe nonlinear rheology of glassy colloids, which exhibit\na continuous slowing down of the structural relaxation\ndue to particle blocking (the \"cage effect\") [1], is less\nclear. While the mode coupling theory (MCT) recovers\nthe linear phenomenology of this fluid-to-glass transition\nfrom microscopic starting points [9], a nonlinear external driving introduces new time scales whose influence\non (non-)equilibration is not understood, and has been\naddressed only in minimal models [10] or mean-field approaches [11]. Moreover, as the true nature of the glass is\nstill uncertain, its behavior under shearing may provide\nbroader new insights (as suggested by recent simulation\nstudies [12, 13]).\nHere we develop a first-principles approach for the\nsimplest case of a disordered colloidal suspension under\nsteady imposed shear, neglecting both many-body hydrodynamics and the resulting velocity fluctuations. We\nfirst identify some generic features in the yield properties\nof glass; approximations suggested by the MCT are then\nintroduced in order to derive quantitative predictions.\nThe system consists of N spherical particles (diameter\nd) dispersed in a volume V of solvent with imposed flow\nprofile v(r) = \u03ba r, where for simple shear with velocity\nalong the x-axis and its gradient along the y-axis, the\nshear rate tensor is \u03baij = \u03b3\u0307 \u03b4ix \u03b4jy . The effect of the\nshear rate \u03b3\u0307 on the particle dynamics is measured by\nthe Peclet number [2], Pe0 = \u03b3\u0307d2 /D0 , formed with the\nbare diffusion coefficient D0 of a particle. Dimensionless\n\nunits are obtained by setting d = D0 = kB T = 1. The\nevolution of the distribution function \u03a8 of the particle\npositions, ri , i = 1, . . . N , under internal forces Fi and\nshearing, but neglecting hydrodynamic interactions, is\ngiven by the Smoluchowski equation [2, 14]:\n\u2202t \u03a8 = \u03a9(\u03b3\u0307) \u03a8 , where \u03a9(\u03b3\u0307) =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u2202i *(\u2202i \u2212Fi \u2212\u03ba ri ) . (1)\n\nThe system is taken to be in quiescent equilibrium\n(\u03b3\u0307 = 0) at t \u2264 0 when averages h. . .i(\u03b3\u0307=0) are the canonical equilibrium ones. Then at t = 0+ , the velocity profile\nis switched on instantaneously, so that the steady state\ndistribution function \u03a8s , which satisfies \u03a9(\u03b3\u0307) \u03a8s = 0, will\nbe approached at long times, t \u2192 \u221e. If \u03a8s was known\nthe steady state average \u03c3 = h\u03c3xy i(\u03b3\u0307) of the (thermodynamic) shear stress [15] could be found. From this the\nshear viscosity would follow as \u03b7(\u03b3\u0307) = \u03b7\u221e + \u03c3/\u03b3\u0307 (where\nthe solvent viscosity is denoted \u03b7\u221e ). But the rapid increase of \u03b7(0) close to the glass transition suggests that\n\u03a8s is sensitively dependent on shear rate, which makes a\ndirect calculation of it difficult.\nA more robust way to approximate steady-state quantities comes from the insight that the growth of \u03b7 at the\nglass transition arises by slowing down of structural relaxations [9], whose characteristic time \u03c4 in the quiescent\nstate defines a second, \"dressed\" Peclet (or Weissenberg\n[1]) number, Pe = \u03b3\u0307\u03c4 . This characterizes the influence\nof shear on structural relaxation and increases without\nbound at the glass transition, even while Pe0 \u226a 1. We argue that the competition of structural rearrangement and\nshearing that arises when Pe> 1 \u226bPe0 dominates the\nnon-linear rheology of colloids near the glass transition.\nTherefore steady state quantities shall be determined by\nconsidering the structural relaxation under shearing and\n\"integrating through the transient dynamics\". Because\nPe0 \u226a 1, we expect ordering or layering transitions to\nbe absent [7]; and as hydrodynamic interactions are presumed to play a subordinate role during the structural\nrelaxation [5] we neglect these too, focusing solely on the\nBrownian contribution to the transverse (shear) stress.\nWith t0 the time passed since the start of shearing, the\ncorrelation function of fluctuations in variables f and g\n\n\f2\nseparated by time t is given by:\nCf g (t, t0 ) = he\n\n(\u03b3\u0307)\n\u03a9B t0\n\nf\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\ne\n\n(\u03b3\u0307)\n\u03a9B\n\nt\n\n\u0011\n\ng i(0) ,\n\n(2)\n(\u03b3\u0307)\n\nwhere the backwards Smoluchowski operator \u03a9B arises\nP\n(\u03b3\u0307)\nfrom partial integrations: \u03a9B = i (\u2202i + Fi + ri \u03baT ) * \u2202i ,\nand t, t0 > 0. Steady state expectation values, hgi(\u03b3\u0307) =\nC1g (t, t0 \u2192 \u221e), and variances, hf \u2217 gi(\u03b3\u0307) = Cf g (t =\n0, t0 \u2192 \u221e) then follow.\nAn important property of the sheared system is translational invariance [16]. It leads to spatially independent averages, or, in Fourier space at wavevector q, to\nhfq i(\u03b3\u0307) = hf0 i(\u03b3\u0307) \u03b4q,0 . In the two-time correlation functions of Eq. (2), it leads to a coupling of fluctuations\nof wavevector q with later fluctuations of the advected\nwavevector q(t) = q + q\u03ba t, suggesting the definition:\nCfk gq (t, t0 ) = N Cf g;q (t, t0 ) \u03b4q(t),k . Figure 1 sketches\nthe advection of a fluctuation with initial wavelength\n\u03bbx to one with \u03bbx and \u03bby (t) = \u03bbx /(\u03b3\u0307t) at later time\nt. Brownian particle motions (assisted by the interaction\nforces) \"smear out\" the fluctuation with time and cause\nthe decay of the corresponding correlator. Because the\nwavenumber q(t) increases upon shearing, smaller and\nsmaller motions can cause the fluctuation to decay [16].\nEquation (2) is an exact consequence of Eq. (1) (for\nthe given shear flow); but to proceed further requires\nadditional approximations. With our assumption that\napplied shear interacts with slow structural rearrangements, we build on the description achieved by the MCT,\nand analyse the approach into the steadyPstate by moniN\ntoring the fluctuations of density (\u033aq = i=1 eiqri ) and\nof the \"pair density\" (the square of the density in real\nspace), aiming to establish nonlinear closed equations for\nthese. This entails elimination of forces Fi in favor of the\nquiescent-state structure factor Sq (taken to be known)\n\u2013 a near-equilibrium assumption (see below) that is formally uncontrolled but motivated, at least in part, by the\nsmallness of Pe0 .\nSteady state correlators are now approximated by projection onto the density modes, giving\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03b3\u0307 \u221e X kx ky (t)Sk(t) f g 2\nVk \u03a6k (t) ,\ndt\nhf \u2217 gi(\u03b3\u0307) \u2248 hf \u2217 gi(0) +\n2\n2 0\nk(t)N Sk(t)\nk\n(3)\nwith t now the time since switch-on, Sk\u2032 = \u2202Sk /\u2202k, and\nVkf g an easily found static overlap [17]. The transient\ndensity fluctuations are given by \u03a6q (t) = C\u033a\u033a;q (t, 0)/Sq ,\nand are normalized by Sq . They enter Eq. (3) via a\nfactorization\u2013approximation of the density pair\u221afluctuation functions. With the choice f = g = \u033aq / N , Eq.\n(3) gives the steady state structure factor under shear,\nwhereas f = 1 and g = \u03c3xy /V give the transverse stress,\nfor which Vkf g = (N kx ky /V k)Sk\u2032 .\nThe problem of calculating the steady state averages is\nthus \"reduced\" to first finding the transient density fluctuations \u03a6q (t), given by the structural rearrangements\n\nafter switching on the flow, and integrating these in Eq.\n(3). From Zwanzig-Mori (type) manipulations [18], one\nfinds the exact equation of motion:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ t\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a6\u0307q (t) + \u0393q (t) \u03a6q (t) + dt mq (t, t ) \u03a6\u0307q (t ) = 0 . (4)\n0\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0307q (t) = \u2202t \u03a6q (t), and the \"initial decay rate\" \u0393q (t)\nexhibits the familiar Taylor dispersion [14, 19]. It is not\nknown how to evaluate the microscopic expression for the\nmemory function mq (t, t\u2032 ) exactly. In the MCT spirit\nof our approach, this is approximated by projecting the\nfluctuating forces onto density pairs and factorizing the\nresulting pair-density correlation functions as\nmq (t, t\u2032 ) \u2248\n\n1 X (\u03b3\u0307)\nVq,k (t, t\u2032 ) \u03a6k (t\u2212t\u2032 ) \u03a6q\u2212k (t\u2212t\u2032 ) . (5)\n2N\nk\n\nThe vertex V (\u03b3\u0307) , whose lengthy formula will be published\nelsewhere, is evaluated in the limit Pe0 \u226a 1 (as argued\nabove) but for large times so that \u03b3\u0307t and \u03b3\u0307t\u2032 are finite.\nAs \u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0, it reduces to the standard MCT vertex [9] and\nlike the latter is uniquely determined by the equilibrium\nstructure factor, Sq . For long times, it vanishes as V (\u03b3\u0307) \u221d\n\u22122\nqy qx\u22123 \u03b3\u0307 \u22123 t\u2032 (t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u22121 for qx 6= 0.\nEquations (3) to (5) complete our derivation of closed,\nself-consistent equations for the steady state properties\nof dense sheared suspensions. They contain the bifurcation singularities which lie at the core of MCT. For\n\u03b3\u0307 = 0, upon smooth changes of the input equilibrium\nstate parameters, a fluid with \u03a6q (t \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 0 turns into\nan amorphous solid, \u03a6q (t \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 fq > 0. The fq are\ncalled glass form factors and describe the arrested structure. While transport coefficients of the fluid, like the\nviscosity, are connected to the longest relaxation time of\n\u03a6q (t), elastic constants of the solid, like the transverse\nelastic modulus G\u221e , are given by the fq [9].\nIn the limit of small shear rates, a stability analysis\nof the amorphous solid can be performed and leads to a\ngeneralization of the factorization theorem of MCT [20].\nClose to the bifurcation, the dynamics are governed by\n\u03a6q (t) = fqc + hq G(t), where the fqc describe the glassy\nstructure at the instability and the critical amplitude hq\nis connected to the cage-breaking particle motion; both\nretain their definition from the unsheared situation. Here\nG(t) contains the essential non-linearities of the bifurcation dynamics which arise from the physical feedback\nmechanism (the cage effect). It depends on a few material parameters only and, for |G(t)| \u226a 1, follows from:\nZ t\nd\ndt\u2032 G(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) G(t\u2032 ) . (6)\n\u03b5 \u2212 c(\u03b3\u0307) (\u03b3\u0307 t)2 + \u03bb G 2 (t) =\ndt 0\nHere, \u03b5 measures the distance to the transition and \u03bb is\nknown for some systems [9]. Monte Carlo estimations of\nthe microscopic expression for the (new) parameter c(\u03b3\u0307)\ngive c(\u03b3\u0307) \u2248 3 for hard spheres. Corrections of higher\n\n\f3\norder in the small quantities (\u03b5, \u03b3\u0307, G) are neglected; see\n[21] for background on Eq. (6) for \u03b3\u0307 = 0.\nEquation (6) is our central result. As expected, the\nsign of \u03b3\u0307 does not enter, although it affects the Taylor dispersion. Because (\u03b3\u0307t)2 dominates for\np long times, always\nG(t\u2192\u221e) \u2192 \u2212t/\u03c4 (\u03b3\u0307) , with \u03c4 (\u03b3\u0307) = (\u03bb \u2212 1/2)/c(\u03b3\u0307) /|\u03b3\u0307|.\nHence, under flow, density fluctuations always decay, as\nthis decrease of G(t) for long times initiates the final relaxation (where the corrections to Eq. (6) become important) of \u03a6q (t) to zero. Arbitrarily small shear rates \u03b3\u0307\nmelt the glass and so \"interrupt\" aging, as has also been\nfound for spin-glasses where shearing was mimicked by\nbreaking detailed balance [11]. This vindicates our decision to ignore aging and to proceed via Eq. (3) in order\nto obtain steady state properties.\nWhile the non-Newtonian fluid behavior (\u03b5 < 0) includes two slow time scales, the familiar \u03c4 and the shear\ninduced \u03c4 (\u03b3\u0307) , the rheology of glass (\u03b5 \u2265 0) is determined\nby \u03c4 (\u03b3\u0307) onlyp[22]. For \u03b5 \u2192 0+ and \u03b3\u0307 = 0, a fraction\nfq = fqc +hq \u03b5/(1 \u2212 \u03bb) of the density fluctuations would\nstay arrested, while with shear these decay at a rate set\n(\u03b3\u0307)\nby \u03b3\u0307: \u03a6q (t) \u2192 fq \u03a6+\n), where \u03a6+\nq (t/\u03c4\nq (x\u21920) \u2212 1 \u221d \u2212x,\nas follows from Eq. (6).\nFor \u03b5 \u2265 0 and \u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0, the time for the final decay\ncan become arbitrarily slow compared to the time char(\u03b3\u0307)\nacterizing the decay onto fq . Inserting \u03a6+\n) into\nq (t/\u03c4\nEq. (3), the long time contributions separate out, and\ndepend on time only via \u03b3\u0307t. Hence the glass has nontrivial shear-rate-independent limits for steady state values:\nhf \u2217 gi(\u03b3\u0307) \u2192 hf \u2217 gi(+) 6= hf \u2217 gi(0) for \u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0. The hf \u2217 gi(+)\n(\u03b3\u0307)\nare given by integrals over the \u03a6+\n) and quantify\nq (t/\u03c4\nthose fluctuations that require the presence of shearing\nto avoid their arrest. For the case of the shear stress, a\nfinite (dynamical) yield stress, \u03c3 + = lim\u03b3\u0307\u21920 h\u03c3xy i(\u03b3\u0307) for\n\u03b5 \u2265 0, is thereby found. Since the glass transition is often\nidentified by a divergence of viscosity (in terms of which\nwe have shear thinning: \u03b7(\u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0) \u221d \u03b3\u0307 \u2212m with m = 1)\nour prediction of a finite yield stress throughout the glass\nphase is far from trivial. It excludes e.g. power-law fluid\nbehavior (\u03c3 \u223c \u03b3\u0307 1\u2212m with 0 < m < 1; see [10]).\nThese results follow from the general stability analysis of Eq. (6) and are predicted to be universal, i.e. to\nhold for the Brownian contribution to the shear stress\nand viscosity close to the glass transition in any colloidal\ndispersion. But because (in contrast to aging approaches\n[23]) we approximate nonlinear couplings under shear using equilibrium averages, we require the system to remain\n\"close to equilibrium\" in some sense. The existence of a\nfinite yield stress \u03c3 + means that this is not guaranteed\neven as \u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0.\nInsight into an important mechanism of shearfluidization can be gained by considering transient density fluctuations with wavevector q perpendicular to the\nflow plane, q = q\u00eaz . Here V (\u03b3\u0307) simplifies to the standard\nMCT vertex with advected (time-dependent) wavevectors [24]. While for \u03b3\u0307 = 0 it exhibits the nonlinear cou-\n\npling of density correlators with wavelength equal to the\naverage particle distance, for \u03b3\u0307 6= 0, the (only) effect of\nshearing on this \"neutral\" direction consists in a shift of\nthe advected wavevectors to higher values, where the effective potential decreases. This decreases the memory\nfunction and thus speeds up structural rearrangements.\nIn this way the theory captures the faster decay of fluctuations caused by shear advection (cf Fig. 1).\nThe presence of shear advection in the neutral zdirection suggests an approximation that considers only\nthe resulting competition of caging and advectioninduced decay. In this \"isotropically sheared hard sphere\nmodel\" (ISHSM) [25], we neglect kinematic flow of particles so that all directions are treated as \"neutral\". The\nquiescent Sq depends only on the packing fraction \u03c6, and\nthe model's glass transition lies at \u03c6c = 0.51591 [21].\nFigure 2 shows the stress versus strain rate curves for \u03c6\nclose to the transition. In the fluid, \u03c6 < \u03c6c , a Newtonian regime (\u03c3 = \u03b7 \u03b3\u0307) is found for \u03b3\u0307 small enough that\nPe < 1. For Pe > 1 there is a broad crossover to the critical yield stress value, \u03c3c+ = \u03c3 + (\u03b5 \u2192 0+), from which \u03c3\nstarts to rise due to (non-universal) short-time effects for\nPe0 around 10\u22122 (where \u03b7\u221e will also contribute). In the\nglass, \u03c6 \u2265 \u03c6c , a yield stress plateau for \u03b3\u0307 \u2192 0 is obtained,\nand rises strongly with increasing packing fraction. We\nspeculate that the lack of a clear yield stress plateau at\nPe0 \u2265 10\u22123 (and likely hydrodynamic effects) explains\nshear-thinning exponents m < 1 seen in experiments [7].\nIn summary, we have presented a microscopic theory\nof the nonlinear rheology of colloidal fluids and glasses\nunder steady shear. It predicts a universal transition\nbetween shear-thinning fluid flow, with diverging viscosity upon increasing the interactions, and solid yielding,\nwith a yield stress that is finite at (and beyond) the glass\npoint. Besides its interest for dispersion flow, our work\nsuggests a further role of colloidal systems in elucidating glasses via the study of shear-melted states for small\nshear rates. This is of fundamental interest because, e.g.,\nmean-field driven spin-glass theories predict nothing like\na yield stress [11]. While comparison with measurements\nin colloids [6, 7, 8] and simulations of sheared atomic\nglasses [12, 13] is promising, our approach represents only\nthe first step toward rational prediction of the rheology\nof a glass; though physically motivated and in part inspired by the successful MCT description of the cageeffect, several of our approximations remain incompletely\njustified. Nor is it clear whether Eqs. (4,5) can exhibit\n\"jamming\" transitions [26] at finite shear rates, or how\nanisotropic [27] the fluctuations can become. Extension\nto time dependent shearing would be especially interesting because recent shear echo measurements [28] reveal\nintriguing glass-melting scenarios.\nWe thank J.-L. Barrat, J.
