We use cross ratios to describe second real continuous bounded\ncohomology for locally compact \u03c3-compact topological groups. We also investigate the second continuous bounded cohomology group of a closed subgroup\nof the isometry group Iso(X) of a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space X\nand derive some rigidity results for Iso(X)-valued cocycles.\n\n1. Introduction\nA geodesic metric space X is called \u03b4-hyperbolic for some \u03b4 > 0 if it satisfies the\n\u03b4-thin triangle condition: For every geodesic triangle in X with sides a, b, c the side\na is contained in the \u03b4-neighborhood of b \u222a c. If X is proper then X can naturally\nbe compactified by adding the Gromov boundary \u2202X. The isometry group Iso(X)\nof X, equipped with the compact open topology, is a locally compact \u03c3-compact\ntopological group which acts on X \u222a \u2202X as a group of homeomorphisms. The limit\nset of a closed subgroup G of Iso(X) is the set of accumulation points in \u2202X of an\norbit of the action of G on X; this limit set is a compact G-invariant subset of \u2202X.\nThe group G is called elementary if its limit set consists of at most two points.\nLet S be a standard Borel space and let \u03bc be a Borel probability measure on S.\nLet \u0393 be a countable group which admits a measure preserving ergodic action on\n(S, \u03bc). An Iso(X)-valued cocycle for this action is a measurable map \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 S \u2192\nIso(X) such that \u03b1(gh, x) = \u03b1(g, hx)\u03b1(h, x) for all g, h \u2208 \u0393 and \u03bc-almost every\nx \u2208 S. The cocycle \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle \u03b2 : \u0393 \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) if there\nis a measurable map \u03c6 : S \u2192 Iso(X) such that \u03c6(gx)\u03b1(g, x) = \u03b2(g, x)\u03c6(x) for all\ng \u2208 G, \u03bc-almost every x \u2208 S. Recall that a compact extension of a locally compact\ntopological group G is a locally compact topological group H which contains a\nnormal compact subgroup K such that G = H/K as topological groups. Extending\nearlier results of Monod and Shalom [14] we show in Section 4.\nTheorem A: Let G be a semi-simple Lie group with finite center, no compact\nfactors and of rank at least 2. Let \u0393 < G be an irreducible lattice which admits a\nmixing measure preserving action on a probability space (S, \u03bc). Let X be a proper\nhyperbolic geodesic metric space and let \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) be a cocycle; then one\nof the following two possibilities holds.\n(1) \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle into an elementary subgroup of Iso(X).\nDate: August 24, 2005.\nPartially supported by Sonderforschungsbereich 611.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\n(2) \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle into a subgroup H of Iso(X) which is a\ncompact extension of a simple Lie group L of rank one, and there is a\ncontinuous surjective homomorphism G \u2192 L.\n\nThe proof of this result uses second bounded cohomology for closed subgroups\nof the isometry group Iso(X) of X. Here the second bounded cohomology group\nof a locally compact topological group G with coeffients in a Banach module E for\nG, i.e. a Banach space E together with a continuous homomorphism of G into the\ngroup of linear isometries of E, is defined as follows. For every i \u2265 1, the group G\nnaturally acts on the vector space Cb (Gi , E) of continuous bounded maps Gi \u2192 E.\nIf we denote by Cb (Gi , E)G \u2282 Cb (Gi , E) the linear subspace of all G-invariant such\n2\nmaps, then the second continuous bounded cohomology group Hcb\n(G, E) of G with\ncoefficients E is defined as the second cohomology group of the complex\n(1)\n\nd\n\nd\n\n\u2192 ...\n\u2192 Cb (G2 , E)G \u2212\n0 \u2192 Cb (G, E)G \u2212\n\nwith the usual homogeneous coboundary operator d (see [13]). If G is a countable\n2\ngroup with the discrete topology then we write Hb2 (G, E) = Hcb\n(G, E). Of particular importance is the case that E = R with the trivial G-action which yields real\n2\ncontinuous second bounded cohomology. There is a natural map of Hcb\n(G, R) to\n2\nthe ordinary continuous second cohomology group Hc (G, R) of G which in general\nis neither injective nor surjective.\nIf G is a non-elementary closed subgroup of the isometry group of a proper\nhyperbolic geodesic metric space X with limit set \u039b \u2282 \u2202X which does not act\ntransitively on the complement of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b then the kernel of the\n2\nnatural map Hcb\n(G, R) \u2192 Hc2 (G, R) is infinite dimensional [9]. In contrast, we\nshow in Section 3.\n\nTheorem B: Let X be a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space and let G <\nIso(X) be a non-elementary closed subgroup with limit set \u039b. If G acts transitively\non the complement of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b then the kernel of the natural map\n2\n(G, R) \u2192 Hc2 (G, R) is trivial.\nHcb\n\nIn Section 2 we identify for an arbitrary locally compact \u03c3-compact topological\n2\ngroup G the group Hcb\n(G, R) with the vector space of measurable anti-symmetric\nG-cross ratios on a strong boundary for G. As an application we describe the\nkernel of the natural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u0393, R) for a lattice \u0393 in P SL(2, R).\nNamely, recall that \u0393 acts as a group of orientation preserving isometries on the\nhyperbolic plane H2 and hence it acts on the boundary S 1 = \u2202H2 of H2 preserving\nthe measure class of the Lebesgue measure \u03bb. We show that the kernel of the\nnatural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u0393, R) is naturally isomorphic to the vector space of\nall finite \u0393-invariant reflection-anti-invariant finitely additive signed measures \u03bc on\nthe complement of the diagonal in S 1 \u00d7 S 1 with the additional property that the\nmap (a, b, c, d) \u2208 S 1 \u2192 \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) is \u03bb-measurable.\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n3\n\n2. Cross-ratios and bounded cohomology\nLet X be an arbitrary set with infinitely many points. We define an antisymmetric cross ratio for X to be a bounded function [ ] on the space of quadruples\nof pairwise distinct points in X with the following additional properties.\ni) [\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ] = \u2212[\u03be \u2032 , \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ].\nii) [\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03be, \u03be \u2032 ] = \u2212[\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ].\niii) [\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ] + [\u03be \u2032 , \u03be \u2032\u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ] = [\u03be, \u03be \u2032\u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ].\nNote that [ ] can naturally be extended by 0 to the set of quadruples of points in\nX of the form (\u03be, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) where \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 are pairwise distinct.\nLet \u0393 be an arbitrary countable group which acts on X. We define a \u0393-cross\nratio on X to be an anti-symmetric cross ratio on X which is invariant under the\naction of \u0393. Let C(\u0393, X) be the vector space of all anti-symmetric \u0393-cross ratios on\nX, equipped with the supremums-norm k k. Thus we have k[ ]k = sup{[\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ] |\n\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2208 X are pairwise distinct}, and (C(\u0393, X), k k) is naturally a Banach space.\nThe second real bounded cohomology group Hb2 (\u0393, R) of \u0393 is a vector space of\nequivalence classes of bounded functions on \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 which are invariant under the\nfree left action of \u0393. It can be equipped with a natural pseudo-norm which assigns\nto a cohomology class the infimum of the supremums-norms of any representative\nof the class. For the second bounded cohomology, this pseudo-norm turns out to be\na norm which provides Hb2 (\u0393, R) with the structure of a Banach space. We have.\nProposition 2.1: There is a continuous linear map \u03a9 : C(\u0393, X) \u2192 Hb2 (\u0393, R).\nProof: Let [ ] \u2208 C(\u0393, X) and let (\u03be, \u03b6, \u03b7) be a triple of pairwise distinct points in\nX. Choose an arbitrary point \u03bd \u2208 X which is distinct from any of the points in the\ntriple and define\n\u0001\n1\n(2)\n\u03c6(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) = [\u03be, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd] + [\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd] + [\u03b7, \u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd] .\n2\nWe claim first that this does not depend on the choice of \u03bd. Namely, let \u03bd \u2032 \u2208\nX \u2212 {\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6} be arbitrary. We compute\n(3)\n\n[\u03be, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd] + [\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd]+[\u03b7, \u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd] \u2212 [\u03be, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd \u2032 ] \u2212 [\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd \u2032 ] \u2212 [\u03b7, \u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd \u2032 ]\n= [\u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03b7] + [\u03be, \u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd]+[\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03be] + [\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd] + [\u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03b6] + [\u03b7, \u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd]\n= [\u03be, \u03b6, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd]+[\u03b6, \u03b7, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd] + [\u03b7, \u03be, \u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd] = 0\n\nby the defining properties of an anti-symmetric cross ratio. This shows our claim.\nAs a consequence, the function \u03c6 is well defined, moreover it is invariant under\nthe action of the group \u0393. Its supremums norm is bounded in absolute value by\n3k[ ]k/2. We extend \u03c6 by 0 to the set of all triples of points in X for which at least\ntwo of the points coincide. Then \u03c6 induces a bounded function \u03bc on \u03933 which is\ninvariant under the free left action of \u0393 as follows. Choose any point \u03be \u2208 X and\ndefine \u03bc(\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 ) = \u03c6(\u03b31 \u03be, \u03b32 \u03be, \u03b33 \u03be).\n\n\f4\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\nWe next show that this function \u03bc is a cocycle, i.e. that it is alternating and\nits image under the natural coboundary map L\u221e (\u03933 , R) \u2192 L\u221e (\u03934 , R) vanishes.\nFor this it is enough to show the corresponding properties for the function \u03c6.\nNamely, observe that for a triple (a, b, c) of pairwise distinct points in X and any\nd \u2208 X \u2212 {a, b, c} we have\n(4)\n\n2(\u03c6(a, c, b) + \u03c6(a, b, c)) = [a, b, c, d] + [b, c, a, d] + [c, a, b, d]\n+[a, c, b, d]+[c, b, a, d] + [b, a, c, d] = 0 = 2(\u03c6(a, c, b) + \u03c6(c, a, b)).\n\nwhich shows that \u03c6 is alternating. Next we have to show that\n(5)\n\n\u03c6(b, c, d) \u2212 \u03c6(a, c, d) + \u03c6(a, b, d) \u2212 \u03c6(a, b, c) = 0\n\nfor any quadruple (a, b, c, d) of points in X. By our observation (4), equation (5) is\nvalid for every quadruple (a, b, c, d) of points in X for which at least 2 of the points\ncoincide. On the other hand, for every quadruple (a, b, c, d) of pairwise distinct\npoints in X we have\n(6)\n\n2(\u03c6(a, b, c) \u2212 \u03c6(b, c, d)) = [a, c, b, d] + [c, b, a, d] + [b, a, c, d]\n\u2212[b, d, c, a] \u2212 [d, c, b, a]\u2212[c, b, d, a] = 2[c, b, a, d]\n\nby the defining properties of an anti-symmetric cross ratio. Together with equation\n(4) we deduce with the same calculation as before that \u03c6(a, c, d) \u2212 \u03c6(a, b, d) =\n\u2212\u03c6(c, a, d) + \u03c6(a, d, b) = \u2212[d, a, c, b] = \u2212[c, b, a, d] and consequently \u03c6 satisfies the\ncocycle equation (5). Therefore the function \u03bc on \u0393 defines a bounded cocycle and\nhence a second bounded cohomology class \u03a9([ ]) \u2208 Hb2 (\u0393, R).\nWe next observe that the cohomology class \u03a9([ ]) does not depend on the choice\nof the point \u03be \u2208 X which we used to define the function \u03c6. Namely, let \u03b7 be a\ndifferent point in X and define \u03bc\u2032 (\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 ) = \u03c6(\u03b31 \u03b7, \u03b32 \u03b7, \u03b33 \u03b7). For \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 write\n\u03bd(\u03b3) = [\u03b3\u03be, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03b3\u03b7]. By equation (4),(6) we have \u03bd(\u03b3) = \u03c6(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b3\u03be) + \u03c6(\u03b3\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b3\u03b7)\nand consequently \u03bc(e, \u03b31 , \u03b32 )\u2212 \u03bc\u2032 (e, \u03b31 , \u03b32 )\u2212 \u03bd(\u03b31 )\u2212 \u03bd(\u03b31\u22121 \u03b32 )+ \u03bd(\u03b32 ) is the value of\n\u03c6 on the boundary of a singular polyhedron of dimension 3 whose vertices consist of\nthe points \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b31 \u03be, \u03b31 \u03b7, \u03b32 \u03be, \u03b32 \u03b7 and whose sides contain the simplices with vertices\n\u03be, \u03b31 \u03be, \u03b32 \u03be and \u03b7, \u03b31 \u03b7, \u03b32 \u03b7 as well as three quadrangles with the same set of vertices.\nSince \u03c6 is a cocycle, the evaluation of \u03c6 on this polyhedron vanishes and therefore\nthe function \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 is the image of a \u0393-invariant bounded function on \u03932 under the\ncoboundary map L\u221e (\u03932 ) \u2192 L\u221e (\u03933 ). As a consequence, for every [ ] \u2208 C(\u0393, X) the\nbounded cohomology class \u03a9([ ]) \u2208 Hb2 (\u0393, R) only depends on the cross ratio [ ] but\nnot on the choice of a point \u03be \u2208 X. The resulting map \u03a9 : C(\u0393, X) \u2192 Hb2 (\u0393, R) is\nclearly linear and continuous with respect to the supremums norm on C(\u0393, X) and\n\u0003\nthe Gromov norm on Hb2 (\u0393, R).\nFor a topological space X define a continuous anti-symmetric cross ratio to be\na continuous function [ ] on the space of quadruples of pairwise distinct points in\nX which is an anti-symmetric cross ratio in the sense of our definition. If G is\nany locally compact \u03c3-compact topological group which acts on a locally compact\n\u03c3-compact topological space X as a group of homeomorphisms, then we define a\ncontinuous anti-symmetric G-cross-ratio to be a continuous anti-symmetric cross\nratio on X which is invariant under the diagonal action of G.\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n5\n\nEvery locally compact \u03c3-compact group G acts freely on itself by left translations.\nThus we can use Proposition 2.1 for X = G to deduce that there is a continuous\nlinear map from the vector space of all continuous anti-symmetric G-cross ratios\n2\n(G, R). Namely, we have.\non G into Hcb\n2\nCorollary 2.2: Let G be a locally compact \u03c3-compact group; then Hcb\n(G, R) is\nthe quotient of the space of continuous anti-symmetric G-cross ratios on G under\nthe coboundary relation.\n\nProof: By Proposition 2.1 and its proof there is a linear map \u03a9 from the space\n2\nof all continuous anti-symmetric G-cross ratios on G into Hcb\n(G, R). We have to\nshow that \u03a9 is surjective. For this recall first that every second continuous bounded\ncohomology class for G is the class of a G-invariant continuous alternating function\n\u03c6 on G3 which satisfies the cocycle equation (5) (see [10, 13]). For such a function\n\u03c6 define [g, g \u2032 , h, h\u2032 ] = \u03c6(h, g \u2032 , g) \u2212 \u03c6(g \u2032 , g, h\u2032 ) as in the proof of Proposition 2.1.\nThen [ ] is continuous and G-invariant; we claim that it satisfies the requirements\nof an anti-symmetric G-cross ratio.\nNamely, first of all we have\n(7)\n\n[b, c, a, d] = \u03c6(a, c, b) \u2212 \u03c6(c, b, d) = \u2212\u03c6(a, b, c) + \u03c6(b, c, d) = \u2212[c, b, a, d]\n\nsince \u03c6 is alternating and similarly\n(8)\n\n[a, d, c, b] = \u03c6(c, d, a) \u2212 \u03c6(d, a, b) = \u2212\u03c6(a, b, d) + \u03c6(a, c, d) = \u2212[c, b, a, d].\n\nIn the same way we obtain from the cocycle equation (5) for \u03c6 that\n(9)\n\n[a, b, c, d] + [b, b\u2032 , c, d] = [a, b\u2032 , c, d]\n\nwhich shows that [ ] is indeed a G-invariant anti-symmetric cross ratio. By the\nproof of Proposition 2.1, the cohomology class of \u03c6 is just \u03a9([ ]). Thus the map \u03a9\nis surjective.\n\u0003\nA locally compact \u03c3-compact topological group G admits a strong boundary [11]\nwhich is a standard measure space (B, \u03bc) together with a measure class preserving\naction of G such that the following two conditions are satisfied.\n(1) The G-action on B is amenable.\n(2) For any separable Banach-G-module E, any measurable G-equivariant map\nB \u00d7 B \u2192 E is essentially constant.\nDefine a measurable anti-symmetric cross ratio on B to be a measurable essentially\nbounded G-invariant function on the space of quadruples of distinct points in B\nwhich satisfies almost everywhere the defining equation for a cross ratio. Our above\nconsiderations immediately imply.\n2\nLemma 2.3: Let (B, \u03bc) be a strong boundary for G; then Hcb\n(G, R) is naturally\nisomorphic to the space of G-invariant \u03bc-measurable anti-symmetric cross ratios\non B.\n\n\f6\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\nProof: Let G be a locally compact \u03c3-compact group and let (B, \u03bc) be a strong\nboundary for G. Denote for k \u2265 1 by L\u221e (B k , \u03bck ) the Banach space of essentially bounded \u03bck -measurable functions on B k ; it contains the closed subspace\nL\u221e (B k , \u03bck )G of all G-invariant such functions. By the results of Burger and Monod\n2\n[6], Hcb\n(G, R) coincides with the second bounded cohomology group of the resolution\n(10)\n\nR \u2192 L\u221e (B, \u03bc)G \u2192 L\u221e (B 2 , \u03bc2 )G \u2192 . . .\n\nwith the usual homogeneous coboundary operator [13]. By Proposition 2.1 and\nits proof, there is a natural bijection between the space of \u03bc4 -measurable essentially bounded anti-symmetric G-cross ratios on B and the space of \u03bc3 -measurable\nbounded cocycles on B, i.e. the space of alternating functions in L\u221e (B 3 , \u03bc3 )G\nwhich satisfy the cocycle equation. Any two such bounded cocycles are cohomologous if and only if they differ by the image under the coboundary operator of an\nelement of L\u221e (B 2 , \u03bc2 )G . However, by ergodicity of the measure class \u03bc2 under the\ndiagonal action of \u0393, the vector space L\u221e (B 2 , \u03bc2 )G only contains essentially constant functions. This means that the natural map which assigns to a \u03bc4 -measurable\nG-cross ratio its corresponding bounded cohomology class is injective.\n\u0003\nWe next look at a specific example. Namely, the ideal boundary of the oriented\nhyperbolic plane H2 can naturally be identified with the oriented circle S 1 . The\naction on S 1 of the group P SL(2, R) of orientation preserving isometries of H2 preserves the measure class of the Lebesgue measure \u03bb. Moreover, (S 1 , \u03bb) is a strong\nboundary for P SL(2, R). A triple (a, b, c) of pairwise distinct points in S 1 will\nbe called ordered if the point b is contained in the interior of the oriented subinterval (a, c) of S 1 . Similarly we define a quadruple (a, b, c, d) or pairwise distinct\npoints on S 1 to be ordered. Ordered quadruples define a P SL(2, R)-invariant subset of the space of quadruples of pairwise distinct points in S 1 . There is a unique\nantisymmetric cross ratio [ ]0 on S 1 with the following properties.\n(1) [a, b, c, d]0 = 0 if (a, b, c, d) is ordered.\n(2) [a, b, c, d]0 = 1 if (a, c, b, d) is ordered.\nClearly this cross ratio is measurable and invariant under the action of P SL(2, R).\nWe have.\nLemma 2.4:\n(1) Up to a constant, [ ]0 is the unique non-trivial antisymmetric cross ratio\non S 1 which is invariant under the full group P SL(2, R) of orientation\npreserving isometries of H2 .\n(2) If \u03bc is any Borel measure on S 1 without atoms and if [ ] is any \u03bc-measurable\nantisymmetric cross ratio on S 1 which satisfies [a, b, c, d] = 0 for \u03bc-almost\nevery ordered quadruple of pairwise distinct points in S 1 then [ ] is a multiple\nof [ ]0 .\nProof: If [ ] is any antisymmetric cross ratio which is invariant under the full\ngroup P SL(2, R) then the same is true for the induced function \u03c6 on the set of\ntriples of pairwise distinct points in S 1 . Recall that the group P SL(2, R) acts\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n7\n\ntransitively on the space of ordered triples of distinct points in S 1 and consequently\nwe have \u03c6(a, b, c) = \u03c6(b, c, d) for every ordered quadruple (a, b, c, d) of pairwise\ndistinct points in S 1 . Hence equation (6) in the proof of Proposition 2.1 implies\nthat [a, b, c, d] = 0 whenever the quadruple (a, b, c, d) of pairwise distinct points in\nS 1 is ordered. As a consequence, if [ ] 6\u2261 0 then after possibly multiplying [ ] with\na constant we conclude from the definition of an anti-symmetric cross ratio that\n(a, b, c, d) = 1 whenever (a, c, b, d) is ordered. In other words, up to a constant we\nhave [ ] = [ ]0 which shows the first part of the lemma.\nTo show the second part of the lemma, let \u03bc be a Borel measure on S 1 without\natoms and let [ ] be any \u03bc-measurable antisymmetric cross ratio on S 1 such that\n[a, b, c, d] = 0 for almost every ordered quadruple of pairwise distinct points in S 1 .\nLet (a, b, c, d) be a quadruple of pairwise distinct points in S 1 such that [a, b, c, d] 6=\n0. By the symmetry relation of an antisymmetric cross ratio we may assume that\n(a, c, b, d) is ordered. Thus the point b is contained in the oriented open subinterval\n(c, d) of S 1 . Now if b\u2032 \u2208 (c, d) is another such point then by the defining properties\nof an antisymmetric cross ratio we have [a, b, c, d] + [b, b\u2032 , c, d] = [a, b\u2032 , c, d]. Assume\nfirst that b\u2032 \u2208 (b, d); then the quadruple (b, b\u2032 , d, c) is ordered and consequently we\nhave [b, b\u2032 , c, d] = 0 by assumption and [a, b, c, d] = [a, b\u2032 , c, d]. Via exchanging b and\nb\u2032 we conclude that [a, b, c, d] does not depend on b \u2208 (c, d). Similarly we deduce\nthat in fact [a, b, c, d] only depends on the order of the points in the quadruple\n(a, b, c, d). In other words, [ ] is a multiple of [ ]0 .\n\u0003\nLemma 2.4 shows in particular that [ ]0 corresponds to a generator \u03b1 of the group\n2\n(P SL(2, R), R).\nHcb\nNow let \u0393 < P SL(2, R) be any finitely generated torsion free discrete group.\nThen \u0393 acts freely on the hyperbolic plane H2 as a properly discontinuous group\nof isometries, and S = H2 /\u0393 is an oriented surface. The unit circle S 1 = \u2202H2\nwith the \u0393-invariant measure class of the Lebesgue measure \u03bb is a strong boundary\nfor \u0393. If \u0393 is cocompact then we have H 2 (\u0393, R) = H 2 (M, R) = R and there is a\nnatural surjective restriction homomorphism Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u0393, R). The diagram\nHb2 (\u0393, R)\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nH 2 (\u0393, R)\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n2\nHcb\n(P SL(2, R), R) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Hc2 (P SL(2, R), R)\n\ncommutes and hence in our identification of Hb2 (\u0393, R) with the space of \u0393-invariant\nantisymmetric cross ratios on the unit circle S 1 , the P SL(2, R)-invariant cross\nratio [ ]0 from Lemma 2.4 maps to a multiple of the Euler class of the tangent\nbundle of S. An easy calculation shows that the multiplication factor is in fact\n1 (compare [4] for a detailed explanation of this fact). If \u0393 is not cocompact\nthen S is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact oriented surface \u015c whose\nboundary \u2202 \u015c is a finite union of circles. In particular, the fundamental group of\neach of the boundary circles is amenable. Now the bounded cohomology of any\ncountable cellular space X is naturally isomorphic to the bounded cohomology of\nits fundamental group \u03c01 (X) [10]. Thus Hb (\u2202 \u015c, R) = {0} and hence the relative\ngroup Hb2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) is isomorphic to Hb2 (\u015c, R) = Hb2 (\u0393, R). The image under the\n\n\f8\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\nnatural map \u03b9 : Hb2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) of the pull-back i\u2217 \u03b1 of \u03b1 under the\ninclusion i : \u0393 \u2192 P SL(2, R) is just the Euler class of the (bordered) surface \u015c. In\nother words, the evaluation of \u03b9(i\u2217 \u03b1) on the fundamental class of the pair (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c)\njust equals the Euler characteristic of S (we refer to [4] for a detailed discussion of\na slightly different viewpoint on these facts).\nTo describe the kernel Q of the natural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R), let \u2206\nbe the diagonal in S 1 \u00d7 S 1 and recall that a finitely additive signed measure on\nS 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2212 \u2206 is a function \u03bc which assigns to each oriented rectangle of the form\n[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) where a, b, c, d are pairwise distinct a number \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) \u2208 R such\nthat\n(11)\n\n\u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) + \u03bc[b, b\u2032 ) \u00d7 [c, d) = \u03bc[a, b\u2032 ) \u00d7 [c, d)\n\nwhenever [a, b\u2032 ) = [a, b) \u222a [b, b\u2032 ) is disjoint from [c, d). This measure is flip-antiinvariant if \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) = \u2212\u03bc[c, d) \u00d7 [a, b). Let \u03bb be the Lebesgue measure on S 1\nwhich defines the unique P SL(2, R)-invariant measure class. The collection of all\nfinitely additive flip-antiinvariant signed measures \u03bc on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 with the additional\nproperty that the function (a, b, c, d) \u2192 \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) is \u03bb-measurable is clearly a\nvector space; we call it the space of \u03bb-measurable flip-antiinvariant signed measures.\nWe have (compare Section 2 of [8]).\nCorollary 2.5: There is a linear isomorphism \u03a8 of the kernel of the map\nHb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) onto the vector space of all \u03bb-measurable finite flipantiinvariant \u0393-invariant finitely additive signed measures on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2212 \u2206.\nProof: Every \u0393-invariant \u03bb-measurable anti-symmetric cross ratio [ ] on S 1 defines\na finite finitely additive measurable signed measure \u03bc = \u03a8([ ]) by assigning to an\nordered quadruple (a, b, c, d) of pairwise distinct points in S 1 the value \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7\n[c, d) = [a, b, c, d]. The map \u03a8 : [ ] \u2192 \u03a8([ ]) is clearly linear, moreover by Lemma\n2.4 its kernel is spanned by the cross ratio [ ]0 which defines the Euler class of S\nviewed as a class in H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R). As as consequence, the restriction of the map \u03a8\nto the kernel Q of the natural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) is injective.\nNow let \u03bc be any \u03bb-measurable finitely additive \u0393-invariant flip anti-invariant\nsigned measure on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2212 \u2206. Define an antisymmetric cross ratio [ ] as follows.\nFirst, if (a, b, c, d) is ordered and if a, b, c, d are typical points for \u03bb such that \u03bc[a, b)\u00d7\n[c, d) is defined then we define [a, b, c, d] = \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d). This determines [a, b, c, d]\nwhenever (a, b, c, d) or (b, a, c, d) or (a, b, d, c) is ordered. Choose an arbitrary fixed\ntypical ordered quadruple (a, b, c, d) and define [a, c, b, d] = 0. As in the proof of\nLemma 2.4, if b\u2032 \u2208 (a, b) is arbitrary (and typical) then (c, a, b\u2032 , b) is ordered and\nwe define [a, c, b\u2032 , d] = [a, c, b\u2032 , b] + [a, c, b, d] = \u2212\u03bc[c, a) \u00d7 [b\u2032 , b). Similarly, for a\npoint b\u2032 \u2208 (a, b) and every a\u2032 \u2208 (d, a) define [a\u2032 , c, b\u2032 , d] = [a\u2032 , a, b\u2032 , d] + [a, c, b\u2032 , d] =\n\u03bc[a\u2032 , a)\u00d7[b\u2032 , d)+[a, c, b\u2032 , d]. Successively we can define in this way an anti-symmetric\nmeasurable \u0393-cross ratio on S 1 . As a consequence, the map \u03a8 is surjective. This\nshows the corollary.\n\u0003\nIt follows from our consideration that there is a direct decomposition Hb2 (\u0393, R) =\nQ \u2295 ker(\u03a8) where Q is the kernel of the natural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u015c, \u2202 \u015c, R) and\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n9\n\n\u03a8 is the map which associates to a \u03bb-measurable anti-symmetric \u0393-cross ratio [ ] its\ncorresponding finitely additive signed measure on S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u2212 \u2206.\nRemark: Let \u0393 be a cocompact torsion free lattice in P SL(2, R). Then S =\nH2 /\u0393 is a closed surface of genus g \u2265 2. The geodesic flow \u03a6t acts on the unit\ntangent bundle T 1 S of S. Call two H\u00f6lder continuous functions f, u : T 1 S \u2192\nR cohomologous if the integrals of f, u over every periodic orbit for \u03a6t coincide.\nThis defines an equivalence relation on the vector space of all H\u00f6lder function\non T 1 S. The flip v \u2192 \u2212v acts on T 1 M and induces a map on the space of\ncohomology classes. We showed in [8] that the space of cohomology classes of\nflip anti-invariant H\u00f6lder functions naturally embeds into Hb2 (\u0393, R). Our above\nconsideration yields another such embedding. Namely, every such function f admits\na unique Gibbs equilibrium state which defines a \u0393-invariant locally finite measure\n\u03bc on the complement of the diagonal in S 1 \u00d7 S 1 . The function (a, b, c, d) \u2192 \u03bc[a, b)\u00d7\n[c, d) is H\u00f6lder continuous. Since f is anti-invariant by assumption, the measure is\nnot invariant under the flip unless f is cohomologous to 0. In particular, the signed\nmeasure \u03bc\u0303 defined by \u03bc\u0303[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) = \u03bc[a, b) \u00d7 [c, d) \u2212 \u03bc[c, d) \u00d7 [a, b) is non-trivial,\nflip anti-invariant and H\u00f6lder continuous and hence by Corollary 2.5 it defines a\nnon-trivial class in the kernel of the natural map Hb2 (\u0393, R) \u2192 H 2 (\u0393, R). We do not\nknow whether the signed measures of this form are dense in the space of all finitely\nadditive \u03bb-measurable signed measures equipped with the supremums norm.\n3. Large groups of isometries of hyperbolic spaces\nIn this section we consider a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space X. The\nGromov boundary \u2202X of X is defined as follows. For a fixed point x \u2208 X, define\nthe Gromov product (y, z)x based at x of two points y, z \u2208 X by\n\u0001\n1\n(12)\n(y, z)x = d(y, x) + d(z, x) \u2212 d(y, z) .\n2\nCall two sequences (yi ), (zj ) \u2282 X equivalent if (yi , zi )x \u2192 \u221e (i \u2192 \u221e). By hyperbolicity of X, this notion of equivalence defines an equivalence relation for the\ncollection of all sequences (yi ) \u2282 X with the additional property that (yi , yj )x \u2192 \u221e\n(i, j \u2192 \u221e) [3]. The boundary \u2202X of X is the set of equivalence classes of this relation.\nThere is a natural topology on X \u222a \u2202X which restricts to the given topology on\nX. With respect to this topology, a sequence (yi ) \u2282 X converges to \u03be \u2208 \u2202X if and\nonly if we have (yi , yj )x \u2192 \u221e and the equivalence class of (yi ) defines \u03be. Since\nX is proper by assumption, the space X \u222a \u2202X is compact and metrizable. Every\nisometry of X acts naturally on X \u222a \u2202X as a homeomorphism. Moreover, for every\nx \u2208 X and every a \u2208 \u2202X there is a geodesic ray \u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X with \u03b3(0) = x and\nlimt\u2192\u221e \u03b3(t) = a.\nFor every proper metric space X the isometry group Iso(X) of X can be equipped\nwith a natural locally compact \u03c3-compact metrizable topology, the so-called compact open topology. With respect to this topology, a sequence (gi ) \u2282 Iso(X) converges to some isometry g if and only if gi \u2192 g uniformly on compact subsets of\nX. In this topology, a closed subset Y \u2282 Iso(X) is compact if and only if there is\n\n\f10\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\na compact subset K of X such that gK \u2229 K 6= \u2205 for all g \u2208 Y . In particular, the\naction of Iso(X) on X is proper. In the sequel we always assume that subgroups of\nIso(X) are equipped with the compact open topology.\nThe limit set \u039b of a subgroup G of the isometry group of a proper hyperbolic\ngeodesic metric space X is the set of accumulation points in \u2202X of one (and hence\nevery) orbit of the action of G on X. If G is non-compact then its limit set is a\ncompact non-empty G-invariant subset of \u2202X. The group G is called elementary if\nits limit set consists of at most two points. In particular, every compact subgroup\nof Iso(X) is elementary. If G is non-elementary then its limit set \u039b is uncountable\nwithout isolated points, and G acts as a group of homeomorphisms on \u039b. An\nelement g \u2208 Iso(X) is called hyperbolic if its action on \u2202X admits an attracting\nfixed point a \u2208 \u039b and a repelling fixed point b \u2208 \u039b \u2212 {a} and if it acts on \u039b with\nnorth-south-dynamics with respect to these fixed points.\nAssume that G < Iso(X) is a closed non-elementary subgroup of Iso(X) with\nlimit set \u039b \u2282 \u2202X. If the group G does not act transitively on the complement of\n2\nthe diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b then the kernel of the natural map Hcb\n(G, R) \u2192 Hc2 (G, R)\nis infinite dimensional [9]. Extending Lemma 6.1 of [5], we prove Theorem B from\nthe introduction and show that this is not true for groups G which act transitively\non the complement of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b.\n\nProposition 3.1: Let G < Iso(X) be a closed non-elementary subgroup with\nlimit set \u039b. If G acts transitively on the complement of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b then\n2\nthe kernel of the natural map Hcb\n(G, R) \u2192 Hc2 (G, R) is trivial.\nProof: Let G < Iso(X) be a closed non-elementary subgroup which acts transitively on the space A of pairs of distinct points in \u039b. Then for every fixed point\na \u2208 \u039b the stabilizer Ga of a acts transitively on \u039b \u2212 {a}.\n2\nFollowing [5], an element in the kernel Hcb\n(G, R) \u2192 Hc2 (G, R) can be represented\nby a continuous quasi-morphism, i.e. a continuous function q : G \u2192 R which\nsatisfies\n\n(13)\n\nsup |q(g) + q(h) \u2212 q(gh)| < \u221e.\ng,h\u2208G\n\nSuch a continuous quasi-morphism is bounded on every compact subset of G and\nis bounded on each fixed conjugacy class in G. The quasi-morphism q defines a\n2\nnon-trivial element of Hcb\n(G, R) only if q is unbounded.\nSince G is non-elementary by assumption, G contains a hyperbolic element g \u2208\nG. Let a \u2208 \u039b be the attracting fixed point of g and let b \u2208 \u039b \u2212 {a} be the\nrepelling fixed point. Then g preserves the set of geodesics connecting b to a; note\nthat such a geodesic exists since X is proper. For x, y \u2208 X and a geodesic ray\n\u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X connecting x to a write \u03b2(y, \u03b3) = lim supt\u2192\u221e (d(y, \u03b3(t)) \u2212 t) and\ndefine the Busemann function\n(14)\n\n\u03b2a (y, x) = sup{\u03b2(y, \u03b3) | \u03b3 is a geodesic ray connecting x to a}.\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n11\n\nThen we have |\u03b2a (y, x)| \u2264 d(y, x), moreover there is a number c > 0 only depending\non the hyperbolicity constant for X such that\n(15)\n\n|\u03b2a (*, y) \u2212 \u03b2a (*, x) + \u03b2a (y, x)| \u2264 c\n\nfor all x, y \u2208 X (Proposition 8.2 of [7]). Let \u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X be a geodesic ray\nconnecting x to a. By hyperbolicity, for every t > 0 every geodesic ray connecting\nx to a passes through a neighborhood of \u03b3(t) of uniformly bounded diameter and\ntherefore via possibly enlarging c we may assume that\n(16)\n\n|\u03b2a (\u03b3(t), x) + d(\u03b3(t), x)| \u2264 c\n\nindependent of x, \u03b3, t. Define the horosphere at a through x to be the set Ha (x) =\n\u03b2a (*, x)\u22121 (0). For all x, y \u2208 X the distance between the horospheres Ha (x), Ha (y)\nis not smaller than |\u03b2a (x, y)| \u2212 c. Moreover, the estimates (15),(16) show that for\nall x, y with \u03b2a (x, y) \u2264 0 the distance between y and Ha (x) is not bigger than\n|\u03b2a (x, y)| + 2c.\nLet W (a, b) \u2282 X be the closed non-empty subset of all points in X which lie on\na geodesic connecting b to a. The isometry g \u2208 G is hyperbolic with fixed points\na, b \u2208 \u039b and therefore it preserves W (a, b). If we denote by \u0393 the infinite cyclic\nsubgroup of G generated by g then W (a, b)/\u0393 is compact. As a consequence, there\nis a number \u03bd > 0 and for every x \u2208 W (a, b) and every t \u2208 R there is a number\nk(t) \u2208 Z with |\u03b2a (g k(t) x, x) \u2212 t| < \u03bd. It follows from this and (16) that for every\ny \u2208 X there is some k = k(y) \u2208 Z such that the distance between g k x and the\nhorosphere Ha (y) is at most \u03b40 = \u03bd + 2c.\nBy assumption, the stabilizer Ga < G of the point a \u2208 \u039b acts transitively on\n\u039b \u2212 {a}. Thus there is for every \u03b6 \u2208 \u039b \u2212 {a} an element h\u03b6 \u2208 Ga with h\u03b6 (b) = \u03b6.\nLet x \u2208 W (a, b); since h\u03b6 \u2208 Ga we have h\u03b6\u22121 (Ha (x)) = Ha (h\u22121\n\u03b6 (x)). By our\nabove consideration, there is a number l \u2208 Z such that the distance between g l (x)\nl\nand Ha (h\u22121\n\u03b6 (x)) is at most \u03b40 and therefore the distance between h\u03b6 \u25e6 g (x) and\nHa (x) is at most \u03b40 . Hence via replacing h\u03b6 by h\u03b6 \u25e6 g l \u2208 Ga we may assume\nthat the distance between h\u03b6 (x) and Ha (x) is at most \u03b40 . In particular, we have\n|\u03b2a (*, x) \u2212 \u03b2a (*, h\u03b6 (x))| \u2264 \u03b40 + c. Now h maps the geodesic \u03b3 connecting x to a to\na geodesic h\u03b3 connecting h\u03b6 x to a and hence by the definition of the Busemann\nfunctions, for every t \u2208 R the distance between h\u03b6 (\u03b3(t)) and Ha (\u03b3(t)) is bounded\nfrom above by \u03b40 + 3c. Since \u0393 preserves the set of geodesics connecting b to a we\nconclude that there is a universal constant \u03b41 > 0 such that for every l \u2265 0 the\ndistance between h\u03b6 (g l x) and Ha (g l (x)) is at most \u03b41 .\nFor x \u2208 X denote by Na,x \u2282 Ga the set of all elements h \u2208 Ga with the property\nthat the distance between Ha (x) and hx is at most \u03b40 . Our above consideration\nshows that for every x \u2208 W (a, b) and every \u03b6 \u2208 \u039b \u2212 {a} there is some h\u03b6 \u2208 Na,x\nwhich maps b to \u03b6. For every h \u2208 Na,x the sequence (g \u2212l \u25e6 h \u25e6 g l )l is contained in\nGa and by the above consideration, it maps x into the \u03b41 -neighborhood of Ha (x).\nMoreover, the sequence (g \u2212l \u25e6 h \u25e6 g l (b))l \u2282 \u039b converges as l \u2192 \u221e to b. This\nmeans that there is a number \u03b42 > \u03b41 such that for sufficiently large l the element\ng \u2212l \u25e6 h \u25e6 g l \u2208 Ga maps the point x into the closed \u03b42 -neighborhood Bx of x.\nThe group \u0393 acts on W (a, b) cocompactly and hence if C \u2282 W (a, b) is a compact\nfundamental domain for this action then B = \u222ax\u2208C Bx is compact, moreover for\n\n\f12\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\nevery x \u2208 W (a, b), every element h \u2208 Na,x is conjugate in G to an element in the\ncompact subset K = {u \u2208 G | uB \u2229 B 6= \u2205} of G. As a consequence, the restriction\nto Na,b = \u222ax\u2208W (a,b) Na,x of any continuous quasi-morphism q on G is uniformly\nbounded. By our assumption on G the sets Na,b ((a, b) \u2208 A) are pairwise conjugate\nin G and hence q is uniformly bounded on \u222a(a,b)\u2208A Na,b = N .\nNext we show that the restriction of a quasi-morphism q to the subgroup Ga,b of\nGa which stabilizes both points a, b \u2208 \u039b is bounded. For this consider an arbitrary\nelement u \u2208 Ga,b . Let x \u2208 W (a, b) and let \u03b2a (ux, x) = \u03c4 ; we may assume that\nu 6\u2208 Na,b and hence after possibly exchanging b and a that \u03c4 < 0. Since u preserves\nW (a, b), by (16) we have |d(ux, x) + \u03c4 | \u2264 c\u0303 where c\u0303 > 0 is a universal constant.\nChoose some h \u2208 G with h(a, b) = (b, a); then h preserves the set W (a, b). Let\ng \u2208 Ga,b be the fixed hyperbolic element as before. By our above consideration,\nvia composing h with g l for a number l \u2208 Z depending on h we may assume\nthat d(x, hx) \u2264 \u03b42 for a universal constant \u03b42 > 0. We have hux \u2208 W (a, b) and\n|\u03b2b (hux, x) \u2212 \u03b2a (ux, x)| \u2264 |\u03b2b (hux, hx) \u2212 \u03b2a (ux, x)| + d(hx, x) \u2264 \u03b42 . On the other\nhand, from another application of the estimate (16) we obtain the existence of a\nconstant \u03b43 > 0 such that |\u03b2b (z, y) \u2212 \u03b2a (y, z)| \u2264 \u03b43 for all y, z \u2208 W (a, b). But this\njust means that the distance between hux and u\u22121 x is uniformly bounded and hence\nthe distance between uhux and x is uniformly bounded as well. As a consequence,\nthe element uhu is contained in a fixed compact subset of G. As before, we conclude\nfrom this that |q(u)| is bounded from above by a universal constant not depending\non u and hence the restriction of q to Ga,b is uniformly bounded.\nNow let h \u2208 G be arbitrary and assume that ha = x, hb = y. We showed above\nthat there are hy \u2208 N \u2229 Gx , hx \u2208 N \u2229 Gb with hy (y) = b and hx (x) = a; then\nh\u2032 = hx hy h \u2208 Ga,b and |q(h\u2032 ) \u2212 q(h)| is uniformly bounded. As a consequence, q is\nbounded and hence it defines the trivial bounded cohomology class. This completes\nthe proof of the proposition.\n\u0003\nFrom now on we assume that X is of bounded growth which means that there is\na number b > 1 such that for every R > 1, every metric ball of radius R contains\nat most bebR disjoint metric balls of radius 1. Let G < Iso(X) be a closed nonelementary group with limit set \u039b. Let (B, \u03bc0 ) be a strong boundary for G. By\nLemma 2.2 of [9] there is a G-equivariant map \u03c6 : B \u2192 \u039b. The image \u03bc of \u03bc0 under\nthe map \u03c6 is a measure on \u039b whose measure class is invariant under the action of G\nand such that the diagonal action of G on \u039b \u00d7 \u039b is ergodic with respect to the class\nof \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bc. Since X is of bounded growth by assumption, the stabilizer in Iso(X) of\neach point in \u2202X is amenable and therefore the measure space (\u039b, \u03bc) is a strong\nboundary for G (compare the discussion in [1, 2, 11]). In particular, Corollary 2.3\n2\nimplies that Hcb\n(G, R) is isomorphic to the space of \u03bc-measurable anti-symmetric\nG-cross ratios on \u039b.\nNow assume that G acts transitively on the complement of the diagonal in \u039b\u00d7\u039b.\nThe stabilizer Ga,b of (a, b) acts on \u039b \u2212 {a, b} as a group of homeomorphisms.\nMoreover, there is some g \u2208 G which maps (a, b) to (b, a). Define the group G to be\ndirected if there is a Ga,b -invariant subset U (a, b) of \u039b \u2212 {a, b} of positive \u03bc-mass\nsuch that gU (a, b) \u2229 U (a, b) = \u2205. We have.\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n13\n\nLemma 3.2: Let G < Iso(X) be a closed subgroup with limit set \u039b. Assume that\n2\nG acts transitively on the complement A of the diagonal in \u039b\u00d7\u039b; if Hcb\n(G, R) 6= {0}\nthen G is directed.\nProof: Let G < Iso(X) be a closed subgroup with limit set \u039b which acts transi2\ntively on the complement A of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b. If Hcb\n(G, R) 6= 0 then there\nis some G-invariant measurable nontrivial alternating function \u03c6 on the space of\ntriples of pairwise distinct points in \u039b which satisfies the cocycle identity (4).\nLet \u03c6 be any G-invariant \u03bc-measurable alternating function on the space of\ntriples of pairwise distinct points in \u039b. Let (a, b) \u2208 A; since the action of G on\nA is transitive, there is a set U \u2282 \u039b of positive \u03bc-mass such that \u03c6(a, b, u) > 0\nfor every u \u2208 U . If v = hu for some h \u2208 Ga,b then \u03c6(a, b, u) = \u03c6(a, b, v). Let\ng \u2208 G be such that g(a, b) = (b, a). Then g \u22121 Ga,b g = Ga,b and if G is not directed\nthen for every Ga,b -invariant measurable subset U of \u039b \u2212 {a, b} with \u03bc(U ) > 0\nwe have \u03bc(U \u2229 gU ) > 0. Now for every c \u2208 R and every \u01eb > 0 the set Uc,\u01eb =\n{u | \u03c6(a, b, u) \u2208 (c \u2212 \u01eb, c + \u01eb)} is Ga,b -invariant. By assumption, if \u03bc(Uc,\u01eb ) > 0\nthen we have \u03bc(gUc,\u01eb \u2229 Uc,\u01eb ) > 0 as well and therefore there is some u \u2208 Uc,\u01eb\nwith |\u03c6(a, b, gu) \u2212 c| < \u01eb. Since \u03c6 is alternating we obtain that \u03c6(a, b, gu) =\n\u2212\u03c6(b, a, gu) = \u2212\u03c6(ga, gb, gu) = \u2212\u03c6(a, b, u) \u2208 (\u2212c \u2212 \u01eb, \u2212c + \u01eb) and consequently\n|c| < 2\u01eb. On the other hand, for \u03bc-almost every u \u2208 \u039b and every \u01eb > 0 we have\n\u03bc(U\u03c6(a,b,u),\u01eb ) > 0. From this we deduce that \u03c6 vanishes almost everywhere and\n2\n(G, R) = {0}.\n\u0003\nhence Hcb\nIn the case that G is a simple Lie group of non-compact type and rank 1 we have\nHcb (G, R) 6= {0} if and only if G = SU (n, 1) for some n \u2265 1. That this condition\nis necessary is immediate from Lemma 3.2 and the following observation.\nLemma 3.3: A simple Lie group G of non-compact type and rank one is directed\nonly if G = SU (n, 1) for some n \u2265 1.\nProof: Let G be a simple Lie group of non-compact type and rank one. Then G\nis the isometry group of a symmetric space X of non-compact type and negative\ncurvature with ideal boundary \u2202X. The action of G on \u2202X preserves the measure\nclass of the Lebesgue measure \u03bb and (\u2202X, \u03bb) is a strong boundary for G. The group\nG acts transitively on the space A of pairs of distinct points in \u2202X. If G = SO(n, 1)\nfor some n \u2265 3 then G acts transitively on the space of triples of pairwise distinct\npoints in \u2202X and hence by the above, G is not directed.\nNow let G = Sp(n, 1) for some n \u2265 1. Then for every pair (a, b) \u2208 A there is a\nunique totally geodesic embedded quaternionic line L \u2282 X of constant curvature\n\u22124 whose boundary \u2202L = S 3 \u2282 \u2202X contains a and b. The stabilizer Ga,b of (a, b)\nis contained in the stabilizer GL of L in G which is conjugate to the quotient of the\ngroup Sp(1, 1) \u00d7 Sp(n \u2212 1) < Sp(n, 1) by its center. Moreover, GL acts transitively\non the space of triples of pairwise distinct points in \u2202L. In particular, for every\nu \u2208 \u2202L and every g \u2208 G with g(a, b) = (b, a) the Ga,b -orbit of u coincides with\nthe Ga,b -orbit of gu. More generally, this is true for every point u \u2208 \u2202X \u2212 {a, b}.\nNamely, let P : \u2202X \u2192 L be the shortest distance projection. The subgroup G\u0303P u\nof GL which stabilizes P u is the quotient of the group Sp(1) \u00d7 Sp(n \u2212 1) by its\n\n\f14\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\ncenter. The factor subgroup Sp(n \u2212 1) acts transitively on P \u22121 (P u) while the orbit\nof P u under the group Ga,b consists of the set of all points in L whose distance\nto the geodesic connecting b to a coincides with the distance of P u. As above we\nconclude that for every u \u2208 \u2202X and every g \u2208 G with g(a, b) = (b, a) the Ga,b -orbit\nof u coincides with the Ga,b -orbit of gu. In other words, G is not directed. In the\n4\nsame way we obtain that the exceptional Lie group F20\nis not directed as well. \u0003\nNote that for every n \u2265 1 the group SU (n, 1) admits a non-trivial continuous\n2\nsecond bounded cohomology class \u03b1 \u2208 Hcb\n(SU (n, 1), R) induced by the K\u00e4hler\nform \u03c9 of the complex hyperbolic space X = SU (n, 1)/S(U (n)U (1)), and this class\n2\ngenerates Hcb\n(SU (n, 1), R). The anti-symmetric cross ratio [ ] on \u2202X defining the\nclass \u03b1 is a continuous function on \u2202X with values in [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. We have |[a, b, c, d]| =\n\u03c0 if and only if (a, c, b, d) or (c, a, d, b) is an ordered quadruple of points in the\nboundary of a complex line in X (for a discussion of this fact, references and\napplications to rigidity, see the recent preprint of Burger and Iozzi [4]).\n4. Rigidity of cocycles\nIn this section we consider as before a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space\n(X, d). We equip the isometry group Iso(X) with the compact open topology;\nwith respect to this topology, Iso(X) is a locally compact \u03c3-compact topological\ngroup. Let S be a standard Borel space and let \u03bc be a Borel probability measure\non S. Assume that G is a locally compact \u03c3-compact topological group which\nadmits a measure preserving ergodic action on a standard probability space (S, \u03bc).\nThis action then defines a natural continuous unitary representation of G into the\nHilbert space L2 (S, \u03bc) of square integrable functions on S. Let \u03b1 : G \u00d7 S \u2192\nIso(X) be a cocycle, i.e. \u03b1 : G \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) is a Borel map which satisfies\n\u03b1(gh, x) = \u03b1(g, hx)\u03b1(h, x) for all g, h \u2208 G and \u03bc-almost every x \u2208 S. The cocycle\nis cohomologous to a cocycle \u03b2 : G \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) if there is a measurable function\n\u03c8 : S \u2192 Iso(X) such that \u03c8(gx)\u03b1(g, x) = \u03b2(g, x)\u03c8(x) for all g \u2208 G and almost all\nx \u2208 S. We use Theorem 4.1 of [9] to show (compare [14], [12]).\nLemma 4.1: Let G be a locally compact \u03c3-compact group and let (S, \u03bc) be an\nergodic G-probability space.

Let H < Iso(X) be a closed subgroup with\nlimit set \u039b and assume that \u03b1(G \u00d7 S) \u2282 H but that \u03b1 is not cohomologous to a\n2\ncocycle into a proper subgroup of H. If Hcb\n(G, L2 (S, \u03bc)) is finite dimensional then\neither H is elementary or H acts transitively on the complement of the diagonal in\n\u039b \u00d7 \u039b.\nProof: Let G be a locally compact \u03c3-compact group which admits an ergodic\nmeasure preserving action on a standard Borel probability space (S, \u03bc). Let \u03b1 :\nG \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) be a cocycle and assume that \u03b1(G \u00d7 S) is contained in a closed\nsubgroup H of Iso(X) and that \u03b1 is not equivalent to a cocycle with values in a\nproper closed subgroup of H. Assume moreover that H is not elementary and does\nnot act transitively on the complement of the diagonal in \u039b \u00d7 \u039b. By Theorem 4.1\n2\nof [9], Hcb\n(H, R) is infinite dimensional. More precisely, if T \u2282 \u039b3 is the space of\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n15\n\ntriples of pairwise distinct points in \u039b then there is an infinite dimensional vector\nspace of continuous H-invariant cocycles on T , i.e. continuous H-invariant maps\nT \u2192 R which satisfy the cocycle equation (5).\nLet (B, \u03bd) be a strong boundary for G. By Lemma 2.2 of [9] there is an \u03b1equivariant measurable map \u03c6 : B \u00d7 S \u2192 \u039b. This means that for almost every\n(w, \u03c3) \u2208 B \u00d7 S and every g \u2208 G we have \u03c6(gw, g\u03c3) = \u03b1(g, \u03c3)\u03c6(w, \u03c3). We claim\nthat the image of \u03c6 is dense in \u039b. Namely, otherwise there is a proper closed subset\nA of \u039b which contains the image of \u03c6. Then for every g \u2208 G and almost every\nu \u2208 S the element \u03b1(g, u) \u2208 H stabilizes A, and \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle\nwith values in the intersection of H with the stabilizer of A. Since A is a closed\nproper subset of \u039b, the stabilizer of A intersects H in a closed subgroup H of infinite\nindex which contradicts our assumption on \u03b1.\nWe now follow Monod and Shalom [14]. Namely, choose a continuous H-invariant\nbounded cocycle \u03c9 : T \u2192 R. Define a measurable map \u03b7(\u03c9) from the space\nB\u0303 of triples of pairwise distinct points in B into L\u221e (S, \u03bc) by \u03b7(x1 , x2 , x3 )(z) =\n\u03c9(\u03c6(x1 , z), \u03c6(x2 , z), \u03c6(x3 , z)); then \u03b7 can be viewed as a measurable G-equivariant\nbounded cocycle with values in the Hilbert space of square integrable function on S.\nSince \u03c9 is continuous and \u03c6(B \u00d7 S) is dense in \u039b, this cocycle does not vanish identically. As a consequence, the space of G-equivariant measurable bounded cocycles\nB\u0303 \u2192 L2 (S, \u03bc) is infinite dimensional. On the other hand, B is a strong boundary\nfor G and therefore Hb2 (G, L2 (S, \u03bc)) is isomorphic to the space of measurable G2\n(G, L2 (S, \u03bc))\nequivariant bounded cocycles B\u0303 \u2192 L2 (S, \u03bc) [13]. In other words, Hcb\nis infinite dimensional. This shows the lemma.\n\u0003\nNow consider a semi-simple Lie group G with finite center and no compact\nfactors. Let \u0393 < G be an irreducible lattice in G, i.e. \u0393 is a discrete subgroup of\nG such that the volume of G/\u0393 is finite and that moroever if G = G1 \u00d7 G2 is a\nnon-trivial product then the projection of \u0393 to each factor group Gi (i = 1, 2) is\ndense. The group G acts on G/\u0393 preserving the projection of the Lebesgue measure\n\u03bb on G.\nLet (S, \u03bc) be a standard probability space with a measure preserving action of\n\u0393. Then \u0393 admits a measure preserving action on the product space G \u00d7 S. Since\n\u0393 < G is a lattice, the quotient space (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 can be viewed as a bundle over\nG/\u0393 with fibre S. If \u03a9 \u2282 G is a finite measure Borel fundamental domain for the\naction of \u0393 on G then \u03a9 \u00d7 S \u2282 G \u00d7 S is a finite measure Borel fundamental domain\nfor the action of \u0393 on G \u00d7 S and up to normalization, the product measure \u03bb \u00d7 \u03bc\nprojects to a finite measure \u03bd on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393. The action of G on G \u00d7 S by left\ntranslation commutes with the action of \u0393 and hence it projects to an action on\n(G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 preserving the measure \u03bd (see p.75 of [16]). We have.\nLemma 4.2: Let \u0393 be an irreducible lattice in a product G = G1 \u00d7 G2 of two\nsemi-simple non-compact Lie groups G1 , G2 . If the action of \u0393 on (S, \u03bc) is mixing\nthen the induced action of G1 on ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, \u03bd) is ergodic.\nProof: Let \u0393 be an irreducible lattice in a product G = G1 \u00d7 G2 of two semisimple non-compact Lie groups G1 , G2 with finite center. Let (S, \u03bc) be a mixing\n\n\f16\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\n\u0393-probability space. The induced action of G on (G\u00d7 S)/\u0393 preserves the measure \u03bd\nand restricts to an action of G1 . Since the measure \u03bd is finite, this action is ergodic\nif and only if every G1 -invariant function f \u2208 L2 ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, \u03bd) is constant.\nWe argue by contradiction\nR and we assume that there isR a G1 -invariant function\nf \u2208 L2 ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, \u03bd) with kf k2 d\u03bd = 1 and zero mean f d\u03bd = 0. Let f \u0303 be the\nlift of f to a \u0393-invariant function on G \u00d7 S; then f \u0303 is locally square integrable with\nrespect to the product measure \u03bb \u00d7 \u03bc. For x \u2208 G define a function \u03c6(x) on S by\n\u03c6(x)(y) = f \u0303(x, y); by Fubini's Rtheorem we have \u03c6(x) \u2208 L2 (S, \u03bc) for \u03bb-almost every\nx, moreover\nthe functionRx \u2192 S \u03c6(x)d\u03bc is measurable with respect to \u03bb. We claim\nR\nthat S \u03c6(x)d\u03bc = 0 and S |\u03c6(x)|2 d\u03bc = 1 for \u03bb-almost every x \u2208 G.\nR\nFor thisR recall that by definition of the action of G1 , the functions x \u2192 S \u03c6(x)d\u03bc\nand x \u2192 S |\u03c6(x)|2 d\u03bc are invariant under the action of G1 on G/\u0393 since the action\nof \u0393 on (S, \u03bc) is measure preserving. By Moore's ergodicity theorem the action of G1\non G/\u0393 is ergodic [16] and hence these functions are constant almost everywhere. If\n\u03a9 \u2282 G is a Borel-fundamental domain for the action of \u0393 on GRand\nR if the Lebesgue\nmeasure\n\u03bb\non\nG\nis\nnormalized\nin\nsuch\na\nway\nthat\n\u03bb(\u03a9)\n=\n1\nthen\n\u03a9 S \u03c6(x)d\u03bcd\u03bb = 0,\nR R\n2\n|\u03c6(x)|\nd\u03bcd\u03bb\n=\n1\nand\nhence\nthese\nconstants\nequal\n0,\n1.\nIn\nparticular, if we\n\u03a9 S\ndenote by V the orthogonal complement in L2 (S, \u03bc) of the constant functions then\nthe assignment x \u2192 \u03c6(x) is a V-valued measurable function on G/\u0393.\nLet L[1] (G, V)\u0393 be the space of all \u0393-invariant measurable maps h : G \u2192 V for\nwhich the function khk2 is locally integrable with respect to the Lebesgue measure\n\u03bb on G. Note that L[1] (G, V)\u0393 naturally has the structure of a separable Banach\nspace. The group G1 acts isometrically on L[1] (G, V)\u0393 by left translation. By\nour assumption, there is a non-zero G1 -invariant vector \u03c6 \u2208 L[1] (G, V)\u0393 . Then\n\u03c6 : G \u2192 V is measurable and essentially bounded. Thus the restriction of \u03c6 to\nsuitable compact sets of large measure is continuous; in particular, we can find a\ncompact set K = K1 \u00d7 K2 \u2282 G1 \u00d7 G2 of positive measure, Borel sets D, E \u2282 S of\npositive measure and a number \u01eb > 0 such that the following is satisfied.\n(1) \u03c6(z)(u) \u2265 \u01eb for every z \u2208 K, u \u2208 D.\n(2) \u03c6(z)(v) \u2264 0 for every z \u2208 K, v \u2208 E.\nSince \u03c6 is invariant under the left action of G1 , for any z0 \u2208 K1 , z2 \u2208 K2 and\nz1 \u2208 G1 , u \u2208 S we have \u03c6(z1 , z2 )(u) = \u03c6(z0 , z2 )(u). On the other hand, \u03c6 is also\ninvariant under the right action of \u0393 and hence \u03c6(z1 , z2 )(u) = \u03c6((z1 , z2 )\u03b7)(\u03b7u) for\nevery \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393. In particular, if (z1 , z2 )\u03b7 \u2208 K then we deduce that \u03bc(\u03b7D \u2229 E) = 0.\nThe right action of \u0393 on G1 \\G is ergodic and therefore there are infinitely many\nelements \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393 such that the measure of (G1 \u00d7 K2 )\u03b7 \u2229 K is positive. Moreover, the\naction of \u0393 on (S, \u03bc) is mixing by assumption and hence for every \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393 which is\nsufficiently far away from the identity the image of D under \u03b7 intersects E in a set of\npositive measure. In particular, there is some \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393 with \u03bb((G1 \u00d7K2 )\u03b7\u2229K) > 0 and\n\u03bc(\u03b7D \u2229 E) > 0 which contradicts the above consideration. Thus the vector space\nof G1 -invariant maps in L[1] (G, V)\u0393 is trivial and the action of G1 on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 is\nergodic.\n\u0003\n\n\fBOUNDED COHOMOLOGY, CROSS RATIOS AND COCYCLES\n\n17\n\nThe following corollary completes the proof of Theorem A from the introduction\nand follows as in [14] from Lemma 4.2, the rigidity results for bounded cohomology\nof Burger and Monod [5, 6] and the work of Zimmer [16].\nCorollary 4.3: Let G be a semi-simple Lie group with finite center, no compact\nfactors and of rank at least 2. Let \u0393 < G be an irreducible lattice and let (S, \u03bc)\nbe a mixing \u0393-space. Let X be a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space and let\n\u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X) be a cocycle; then either \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle into an\nelementary subgroup of Iso(X) or there is a closed subgroup H of Iso(X) which is\na compact extension of a simple Lie group L of rank one and there is a surjective\nhomomorphism G \u2192 L.\nProof: Let G be a semi-simple Lie group of non-compact type with finite center\nand of rank at least 2 and let \u0393 be an irreducible lattice in G. Let (S, \u03bc) be a\nmixing \u0393-space with invariant Borel probability measure \u03bc. Let \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 S \u2192 Iso(X)\nbe a cocycle into the isometry group of a proper hyperbolic geodesic metric space\nX. Let H < Iso(X) be a closed subgroup such that \u03b1 is cohomologous to an Hvalued cocycle but not to a cocycle with values in a proper subgroup of H. We\nmay assume that \u03b1(\u0393 \u00d7 S) \u2282 H. Assume that H is not elementary, with limit\nset \u039b. By Theorem A in [9], there is a continuous L2 (H)-valued bounded cocycle\n\u03c6 : \u039b3 \u2192 L2 (H).\nLet \u03a9 \u2282 G be a Borel fundamental domain for the action of \u0393 on G. Let \u03bd\nbe the G-invariant Borel probability measure on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 \u223c \u03a9 \u00d7 S. We obtain\na \u03bd-measurable function \u03b2 : G \u00d7 (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 \u2192 H as follows. For z \u2208 \u03a9 and\ng \u2208 G let \u03b7(g, z) \u2208 \u0393 be the unique element such that gz \u2208 \u03b7(g, z)\u03a9 and define\n\u03b2(g, (z, \u03c3)) = \u03b1(\u03b7(g, z), \u03c3). By construction, \u03b7 satisfies the cocycle equation for the\naction of G on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393. Let (B, \u03bc) be a strong boundary for G; we may assume\nthat B is also a strong boundary for \u0393. By Lemma 4.2 the action of G on (G\u00d7 S)/\u0393\nis ergodic and hence Lemma 2.2 of [9] show that we can find a measurable \u03b2equivariant F\u00fcrstenberg map \u03c80 : (G\u00d7S)/\u0393\u00d7B \u2192 \u039b and hence a \u03b2-equivariant map\n\u03c8 : (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 \u00d7 B 3 \u2192 \u039b3 defined by \u03c8(x, a, b, c) = (\u03c80 (x, a), \u03c80 (x, b), \u03c80 (x, c)) (x \u2208\n(G \u00d7 S)/\u0393). Let L[2] ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, L2 (H)) be the space of all measurable maps (G \u00d7\nS)/\u0393 \u2192 L2 (H) with the additional property that for each such map \u03c6 the function\nx \u2192 k\u03c6k is square integrable on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393. Then L[2] ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, L2 (H)) has a\nnatural structure of a separable Hilbert space, and the group G acts on L[2] ((G \u00d7\nS)/\u0393, L2 (H)) as a group of isometries. In other words, L[2] ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, L2 (H)) is\na Hilbert module for G and the cocycle \u03c6 can be composed with the map \u03c8 to a\n\u03b2-invariant measurable bounded map B 3 \u2192 L[2] ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, L2 (H))3 . Since B is a\nstrong boundary for G we conclude that this map defines a nontrivial cohomology\n2\nclass in Hcb\n(G, L[2] ((G \u00d7 S)/\u0393, L2 (H))).\nNow if G is simple then the results of Monod and Shalom [14] show that there\nis a \u03b2-equivariant map (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 \u2192 L2 (H). Since the action of G on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 is\nergodic, by the cocycle reduction lemma of Zimmer [16] the cocycle \u03b2 and hence \u03b1 is\ncohomologous to a cocycle into a compact subgroup of H which is a contradiction.\nOn the other hand, if G = G1 \u00d7 G2 for semi-simple Lie groups G1 , G2 with finite\ncenter and without compact factors, then the results of Burger and Monod [5, 6]\nshow that via possibly exchanging G1 and G2 we may assume that there is an\n\n\f18\n\nURSULA HAMENST\u00c4DT\n\nequivariant map (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 \u2192 L2 (H) for the restriction of \u03b2 to G1 \u00d7 (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393,\nviewed as a cocycle for G1 . By Lemma 4.2 the action of G1 on (G \u00d7 S)/\u0393 is ergodic\nand therefore the cocycle reduction lemma of Zimmer [16] shows that the restriction\nof \u03b2 to G1 is equivalent to a cocycle into a compact subgroup of H. We now follow\nthe proof of Theorem 1.2 of [14] and find a minimal such compact subgroup K of\nH. The cocycle \u03b2 and hence \u03b1 is cohomologous to a cocycle into the normalizer of\nK in H which then coincides with H by our assumption of H. Moreover, there is a\ncontinuous homomorphism of G onto H/K. Since G is connected, the image of G\nunder this homomorphism is connected as well and hence by Theorem A of [9], H/K\nis a simple Lie group of rank one. This completes the proof of the corollary.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] S.
