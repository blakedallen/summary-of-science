Each line has the same damping constant (and spectral width) \u03b3, where \u03b3 \u226a \u2206.\nClassically, one might expect these oscillators to correspond to the \"V\" configuration\nof atomic levels sketched in Fig. 1a), in which both higher levels can decay to the ground\nstate by emission of photons of frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 . However, quantum mechanics also\npermits the \"\u039b\" configuration sketched in Fig. 1b) in which the highest level can decay to\nthe ground state via emission of a photon of frequency \u03c91 as well as to the intermediate level\nvia emission at frequency \u03c92 .\n\nFigure 1: Two possible level diagrams for a three-level atomic system: a) the\n\"V\" configuration; b) the \"\u039b\" configuration.\nThe present problem is based on a \"\u039b\" configuration in which a laser of frequency \u03c92\npumps oscillator 2. But since the lower level of this oscillator is not the ground state, the\npumping does not result in an inverted population. The physics of this system can be fairly\nwell described by a classical model in which the damping constant of the second oscillator\nis taken to be negative: \u03b32 = \u2212\u03b3. The strengths of both oscillators are positive.\nDeduce an expression for the group velocity of a pulse of light centered on frequency \u03c90\nin this medium. Show also that frequencies very near \u03c90 propagate without attenuation.\nIn a recent experiment [1], the group velocity of light was reduced to 38 mph (17 m/s)\nby this technique in a sodium vapor of density N = 8 \u00d7 1013 atoms/cm3 using a pair of lines\nfor which \u2206/2\u03c0 \u2248 2 \u00d7 107 /s.\n\n2\n\nSolution\n\nIn a medium of index of refraction n(\u03c9), the dispersion relation can be written\n\u03c9n\nk=\n,\nc\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere k is the wave number and c is the speed of light. The group velocity is then given by\nvg =\n\nd\u03c9\n1\nc\n=\n=\ndn .\ndk\ndk/d\u03c9\nn + \u03c9 d\u03c9\n\n(2)\n\nWe next recall the classical oscillator model for the index of refraction. The index n is the\nsquare root of the dielectric constant \u01eb, which is in turn related to the atomic polarizability\n\u03b1 according to (in Gaussian units)\nD = \u01ebE = E + 4\u03c0P = E(1 + 4\u03c0N\u03b1),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D is the the electric displacement, E is the electric field, P is the polarization density,\nand N is the number density of atoms. Then,\n\u221a\nn = \u01eb \u2248 1 + 2\u03c0N\u03b1,\n(4)\nfor a dilute gas with index near 1.\nThe polarizability \u03b1 is obtained from the dipole moment p = ex = \u03b1E induced by electric\nfield E. In the case of a single spectral line of frequency \u03c90 , we say that the electron of charge\ne and mass m is bound to the (fixed) nucleus by a spring of constant K = m\u03c902 , and the\nmotion is subject to damping \u2212m\u03b3 \u1e8b where the dot indicates differentiation with respect to\ntime. The equation of motion in the presence of a wave of frequency \u03c9 is\n\u1e8d + \u03b3 \u1e8b + \u03c902 x =\n\neE\neE0 i\u03c9t\n=\ne .\nm\nm\n\n(5)\n\nHence,\nx=\n\neE\n1\neE \u03c902 \u2212 \u03c9 2 + i\u03b3\u03c9\n=\n,\nm \u03c902 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c9\nm (\u03c902 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\n\n(6)\n\ne2 \u03c902 \u2212 \u03c9 2 + i\u03b3\u03c9\n.\nm (\u03c902 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\n\n(7)\n\nand so the polarizability is\n\n\u03b1=\n\nIn the present problem, we have two spectral lines, \u03c91,2 = \u03c90 \u00b1\u2206/2, both of unit oscillator\nstrength, but line 2 is pumped so that \u03b32 = \u2212\u03b31 = \u2212\u03b3. In this case, the polarizability is\ngiven by\ne2 (\u03c90 + \u2206/2)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c9\ne2 (\u03c90 \u2212 \u2206/2)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 + i\u03b3\u03c9\n+\nm ((\u03c90 \u2212 \u2206/2)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2 m ((\u03c90 + \u2206/2)2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\ne2 \u03c902 \u2212 \u2206\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 2 + i\u03b3\u03c9\ne2 \u03c902 + \u2206\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c9\n\u2248\n+\n,\nm (\u03c902 \u2212 \u2206\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2 m (\u03c902 + \u2206\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )2 + \u03b3 2 \u03c9 2\n\n\u03b1 =\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the approximation is obtained by the neglect of terms in \u22062 compared to those in\n\u2206\u03c90 . The index of refraction (4) corresponding to polarizability (8) is shown in Fig. 2.\nWe next consider the issue of attenuation of a pulse of frequency \u03c9. Since k = \u03c9n/c \u2248\n\u03c9(1 + 2\u03c0N\u03b1)/c, the spatial dependence eikz of a pulse propagating in the z direction includes\nattenuation if the imaginary part of the index n is positive. However, the pumping described\nby \u03b32 = \u2212\u03b31 leads to Im[\u03b1(\u03c90 )] = 0. Hence, there is no attenuation of a probe pulse at\n2\n\n\f0.1\n\n0\nRe(n - 1)\nIm(n)\n-0.1\n\nfrequency\n\nFigure 2: The real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction corresponding to the polarizability (4) in a medium with one of a pair of spectral lines\npumped so as to produce a large rate of change of the index with nearby\nfrequency.\n\nfrequency \u03c90 . This phenomenon has been called electromagnetically induced transparency\n[2].\nSince \u03b1(\u03c90 ) = 0, we have n(\u03c90 ) = 1, and the phase velocity at \u03c90 is exactly c.\nTo obtain the group velocity at frequency \u03c90 , we need the derivative\ndRe(n)\nd\u03c9\n\n= 2\u03c0N\n\u03c90\n\ndRe(\u03b1)\nd\u03c9\n\n=\n\u03c90\n\n4\u03c0Ne2 (\u22062 \u2212 \u03b3 2 )\n4\u03c0Ne2\n\u2248\n,\nm\u03c90 (\u22062 + \u03b3 2 )2\nm\u03c90 \u22062\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the approximation holds when \u03b3 \u226a \u2206 as is the case here. For large density N, the\ngroup velocity (2) is given by\n\u22062\nvg \u2248\n,\n(10)\n4\u03c0Nr0 c\nwhere r0 = e2 /mc2 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm is the classical electron radius. The group velocity is\nlower in a denser medium.\nIn the experiment of Hau et al., the medium was sodium vapor, cooled to less than 100\nnK to increase the density. An additional increase in density by a factor of 16 was obtained\nwhen the vapor formed a Bose condensate. Plugging in the experimental parameters, N =\n8 \u00d7 1013 /cm3 and \u2206 \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 108 /s, we find vg \u2248 1700 cm/s as observed in the lab.\n\n3\n\nReferences\n\n[1] L.V.
