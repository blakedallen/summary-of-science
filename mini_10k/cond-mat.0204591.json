This paper presents a theoretical study of the structure and properties of the phase\ndiagram of these solutions. On the basis of simple phenomenological observations a schematic phase\ndiagram is constructed that allows a simple and explicit determination of the direction of the tie\nlines within the coexistence region. The actual shape of the coexistence boundary is determined by\nmeans of a model mean free energy functional that explicitly includes the possibility of association\nof both counterions and coions to the electrolyte. It is found that it is possible to redissolve the\nelectrolytes into conformations where the bare charge of the electrolyte is overcompensated by the\ncounterions but, due to the associated coions, can have either sign of total effective charge. When\ncoion association is possible, the redissolution approximately coincides with the reassociation of the\ncoions and counterions in the bulk of the solution.\n\nrions and monovalent coions is affected by the Bjerrum\nassociation15 where the ions of the salt within the solution become strongly correlated with each other. Thus,\nan scenario for the redissolution is that the multivalent\nions associated with the electrolyte prefer, without leaving the polymer, to be exposed to such environment.\nOn the other hand, it has been argued by the group of\nShklovskii13 that the main reason for the redissolution is\nthe decrease in energy available to the system by overcharging the electrolytes16 . Since the collapsed structure\nhas to be effectively neutral, the electrolytes redissolve\nso that more counter-ions can associate to them. Both\nthese ideas can be combined and the result provides an\ninteresting picture of different possible charged states for\nthe redissolved electrolyte.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nDilute solutions of strongly charged polymer electrolytes (polyelectrolytes) such as single and double\nstranded DNA1\u20135 , polystyrene sulphonate6 , and other biological and synthetic polymeric systems5,7 exhibit phase\nand/or structural transitions upon addition of multivalent salts to the solutions. First, the addition of multivalent salt causes a collapse of the extended structure\nof flexible polyelectrolytes or the bundling in mono- or\nmulti- molecular structures of semiflexible and rigid electrolytes that segregate into a dense phase, a phenomenon\nwhich in the case of DNA is also know as DNA condensation. Upon further addition of salt, the electrolytes\nredissolve acquiring again extended or unbundled states.\nThere are many different examples of this type of system and it is clear that while the strong charge of the\nelectrolytes is required for the transitions, the precise geometry of the polymers is not a crucial factor. The fact\nthat the transitions are driven only by a combination of\nelectrostatic interactions with entropic and steric effects\nhas been shown by many computer simulations.8\u201310\nThe first transition to a collapsed state is explained\nby the onset of attractive interactions between almost neutral structures formed by electrolytes whose\ncharge is almost compensated by associated multivalent\ncounterions.11\u201313 The redissolution transition indicates\nthat as the concentration of multivalent salt increases\nthe system finds more energetically favorable conformations without packaging its structure. The model presented in this paper emerges from two previously proposed ideas regarding the redissolution transition. In a\nprevious work14 it was argued that a determining factor\nfor the redissolution is the nature of the salty environment into which the electrolyte redissolves. In particular,\nit was emphasized that at large multivalent salt concentrations the thermodynamics of the multivalent counte-\n\nThe central point of this paper to exhibit, by means\nof a simple model, that for large amounts of multivalent\nand monovalent salt added to the system, the redissolution transition is marked by the onset of reassociation of\nthe multivalent salt ions on the bulk of the solvent. In its\nredissolved state the electrolyte acquires a large number\nof multivalent counter-ions that overcompensate its bare\ncharge but, also, associated with them, a large number\nof coions that form a second associated layer. Due to the\nlarge amount of screening of the electrostatic interaction\nnear redissolution conditions, the decrease in energy due\nto the reassociation of coions with the multivalent counterions at the electrolyte surface is of magnitude similar\n(but smaller) to the energy of reassociation in the bulk\nof the solution. Thus, this second layer of associated\ncoions can only exist if Bjerrum association is already\npresent in the bulk of the solution. This second layer\nenhances the decrease in energy of the electrolyte due to\nthe overcharging of the first layer. The presence of the\ncoions reduces the net charge of the region near the electrolyte and thus decreases the Coulombic barrier to multivalent ions overcharge. Furthermore, in such a state,\n1\n\n\fstruction of the phase diagram of the multi-species electrolyte system. While conditions for collapse or redissolution implicitly assume some form of phase transition\nits global structure has not been previously considered in\ndetail. This article proposes, on the basis of simple phenomenological observations, a construction of the structure of the phase diagram, the location of the coexisting\nphases, and the slopes of tie-lines.\nIn the rest of the paper, all free energies are measured\nin units of kT , with k the Boltzmann constant and T\nthe temperature. All concentrations are presented as\nnumber densities. Lengths are measured with respect\nto a microscopic length unit a that is the average size of\nmonomers of the polymer and ions, which are assumed\nto be of roughly the same size. The strength of the electrostatic interaction is quantified by the Bjerrum number\nB = e2 /\u03b5akT which is energy of interaction of two elementary charges at its nearest possible distance in water\n(or the medium considered).\n\nthere is a greater number of particles in strongly correlated states thus decreasing the energy per electrolyte\nand making its redissolution more favorable. The total charge of the near region of the electrolyte that contains all these associated charges can have either charge\nsign, but in all cases the charge from the multivalent\nions overcompensates the bare charge of the electrolyte.\nThis multiple-species association has been observed in\nrecent computer simulations by Tanaka and Grosberg17\nwhere the electrolyte is a small colloidal sphere and by\nHolm and Kremer18 where the electrolyte is a rigid rod18 .\nThe possibility of this second associated layer has been\nknown for long time19,20 but its implications for these\nphase transitions has not been fully explored. Figure 1\npresents an sketch of different possible charged states of\nthe near region of an electrolyte. Consider, for example, a section of electrolyte with total bare charge \u221212,\nand multivalent counter-ions of charge z = +3. At low\namounts of multivalent-salt the total charge of the system is negative, but partially compensated by (a) positive\nmonovalent or (b) multivalent ions. The collapsed state\n(c) is neutral with the electrolyte charge compensated\nby positive multivalent ions, where different electrolytes\nor sections of electrolytes share the positive charges. In\nthe redissolved state the charge of the electrolyte is overcompensated by multivalent ions but the total associated\ncharge can be (d) positive, (e) neutral, or (f) negative due\nto the association of a second layer of negative ions.\n\n+z\n\na\n\nd\n\n-1\n\nb\n\ne\n\nII. STRUCTURE OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM.\nA. Boundaries of the phase diagram\n\nThe basic components of the system are: a solvent,\na dilute polyelectrolyte with monomer concentration \u03c6,\nmonovalent salt s and a multivalent salt \u03c1. Since each of\nthese components dissociate into different ions, we actually start with six different ionic components in solution.\nTo reduce this number, it is possible to consider the case\nin which the charges of the ions are \u22121 for each monomer\nof the polymer, +1 for the original counterions of the\npolymer, \u22121 and +1 for the ions of the monovalent salt,\nand +z and \u22121 for the ions from the multivalent salt.\nIt is further assumed that all of the +1 ions are identical, and similarly for the \u22121 ions. Thus there are only\nfour components, besides the solvent: dissociated polymer at concentration p = \u03c6, positive multivalent ions\nm = \u03c1, positive monovalent ions t = \u03c6 + s, and negative monovalent ions u = zm + s. A further constraint is\nthat each phase formed has to be electroneutral so that\nthe condition \u2212p + zm + t \u2212 u = 0 is always satisfied.\nThese restrictions allow for a description of all the ionic\nspecies in terms of only three concentrations, either of\nsalts (\u03c6, \u03c1, s), or ions (p,m,t).\nThe allowed values of the concentrations of ions can\nbe described as follows. Each ionic particle density\nshould be non-negative, and in the reduced representation (p, m, t) the requirement u \u2265 0 becomes the constraint t \u2212 p + zm \u2265 0. Carrying this constraint to the\nsalt representation shows that (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) should satisfy\n\n+1\n\nc\n\nf\n\nFIG. 1. Sketch of different charge states of a rod-like\nelectrolyte with associated counterions and coions. At low\namounts of multivalent-salt the total charge of the system is\nnegative, but partially compensated by (a) positive monovalent or (b) multivalent ions. The collapsed state(c) is neutral\nwith the electrolyte charge compensated by positive multivalent ions. In the redissolved state, the total charge can be (d)\npositive, (e) neutral, or (f) negative.\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c6,\n0 \u2264 \u03c1,\n\u2212 min(z\u03c1, \u03c6) \u2264 s.\n\nA second goal of this article is to present a simple con2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\fThis last inequality has the following interpretation.\nConsider the case of a state with a small amount of solvent and a dense mixture of only polymer ions with multivalent ions, so that (p, m, t) = (x, \u2212x/z, 0) (and u = 0).\nThis state is physically realizable but its description in\nterms of the salt variables is (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) = (x, x/z, \u2212x). To\nobtain this state one can start with a mixture of polyelectrolyte and multivalent salt and then extract monovalent\nsalt, that is, extract both positive monovalent counterions (given by the polyelectrolyte), and negative monovalent ions (given by the salt). The boundaries of the\npossible states of the system in the salt variables representation are sketched in Figure 2.\n\ndense state, and a second polymer dilute point of the\nform (\u03c6 \u2212 x\u03a6, \u03c1 \u2212 x\u03a6/z, s + x\u03a6). The assumption that\nmost of the high polymer density points of the region of\ncoexistence lie in a very small region and are modeled as\none single point immediately gives rise to this specific decomposition, and it is clear that the slope of the tie-lines\nis always determined by this construction.\nTo summarize, the phenomenological observation that\nthe dense polymer phase is neutral with the polyelectrolyte charge neutralized by multivalent salts leads to\na phase diagram of the form shown in Figure 3 including the tie lines shown. (The choice of cross section for\ndifferent values of the t variable are meant to aid visualization of the diagram and do not reflect actual energetic\nconsiderations.

These diagrams show sections of the planes that\nbound the region of allowed states for the system in the\n(p, m, t), and (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) representations. As explained in the\ntext, the allowed states extend into negative values of the\nmonovalent salt variable s.\n\np\n\nB. Location of the dense phase\n\nExperiments have shown the phase segregation of neutral complexes with little amount of solvent from the bulk\nof the dilute polyelectrolyte solution. The precise location of this dense phase in the salt or ionic components diagram has not been precisely determined experimentally.\nHere it is only necessary for our purposes to assume that\nthis phase has zero or very small amount of monovalent\nions present and that is rich in polyelectrolyte neutralized\nwith multivalent ions with a very small amount of solvent. The dense phase is not a unique point in the phase\ndiagram, but it can be described as a region in the neighborhood of the point(p, m, t) = (\u03a6, \u03a6/z, 0),or (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) =\n(\u03a6, \u03a6/z, \u2212\u03a6),where \u03a6, is the (large) concentration of\nmonomers in this phase and, as explained above, the negative value of s reflects the depletion of monovalent ions\nfrom these states. To simplify the model, however, it\ncan be assumed that the dense phase consists of only one\npoint, namely (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) = (\u03a6, \u03a6/z, \u2212\u03a6).\n\nt\nFIG. 3. Scheme of the region of coexistence in the reduced\ndescription of the components of the system. It is assumed\nthat all tie lines connect points of the bounding surface of the\ncoexistence region with a single point (\u03a6, \u03a6/z, 0) at the one\nextreme of the coexistence region. Four tie lines are shown for\nthe points corresponding to a section defined by a constant\nvalue of the t component.\n\nIII. FREE ENERGY FUNCTIONAL\n\nTo be able to write down an effective free energy functional that describes the polyelectrolyte phase transition\nit is necessary to consider coherently but separately the\ncontributions to the free energy from three different regions. There is a dense precipitated phase that is relatively poor in solvent and rich in polymer and multivalent\nions. Within the dilute phase, there are two distinct regions: the one occupied by the polymer and its associated\ncharges, and the region away from the polymer occupied\nonly by solvent and ions.\nThere are many variants of the problem all of which\npresent similar behavior. The same type of phase diagram occurs for flexible and rigid polyelectrolytes of dif-\n\nC. The tie lines\n\nThe precipitation of the collapsed neutral structures\nfrom the dilute solution indicates that the system has\nentered into a coexisting phase. A point (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) inside the coexistence region decomposes into two coexisting points with compositions (\u03a6, \u03a6/z, \u2212\u03a6), namely the\n3\n\n\fpolymer from each of the ionic species is fm , fu , ft .\nThe average ionic concentrations in the bulk of the solution excluding regions occupied by polymer is then\n(m, t, u)ef f = (m \u2212 fm p/z, t \u2212 ft p, u \u2212 fu p).\nThe free energy density for the system polyelectrolyte\nplus solvent can be written as:\n\nferent lengths. It is simplest to write a model for a collection of rigid rods (say short or medium size DNA). In\nthis case the main barrier arising from the structure of\nthe polyelectrolyte to the formation of a collapsed state\nis purely entropic. If one considers very long semiflexible\nmolecules, the collapse is monomolecular and the barrier\nis of a elastic nature instead of entropic, and requires\nthe introduction of further parameters. The results are\nnevertheless similar.\n\nFt =\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ft is the total free energy density in the dilute\nphase, Fe is the energy per electrolyte monomer due to\nthe interactions between its own and associated charges,\nand Fs is the energy of the solvent an the ions in solution.\nThe values of the associated fractions fi are determined\nby minimization of this expression with respect to them.\nThe salty environment can be modeled as an ionic solution obeying a Debye-Huckel free energy where it is\nnecessary to consider not only the multivalent positive,\nmonovalent positive and negative ions but also an extra\nspecies, the reassociated ions. At the typical concentration at which the redissolution of the electrolyte takes\nplace, there are important corrections to the free energy\nof the solution due to this phenomenon. The simplest\nway to describe the association is to assume that a finite fraction fb of all the multivalent ions in solution are\nassociated with the same number of positive monovalent\nions thus forming a new species of reduced charge (z \u2212 1)\nwith concentration ma = fb mef f . While in general there\ncan be further reassociation to states of charge z \u2212 2 etc.,\nonly the first reassociation will be treated explicitly here.\nUpon reassociation, the magnitude of the energy of a pair\nof associated ions is gb . The new concentrations of non\nassociated ions are mn = mef f \u2212ma , and un = uef f \u2212ma .\nThe free energy for the solvent is then:\n\nA. Two States modeling\n\nWhile it is clear that the region of phase coexistence\ndoes not separate two topologically disconnected regions\nin the full phase diagram, it is nevertheless useful to write\ndown two separate free energy functionals for the states\nat the ends of a tie line. It is very hard to write down one\nsingle free energy functional that interpolates between\nthe dense and dilute phase, especially for flexible electrolytes. When using different functionals for each phase,\na phase transition can be properly determined only if\nboth functionals are good approximations of the absolute\nfree energy and refer to a same (arbitrary) zero energy\npoint. In this case this goal is achieved by using similar\napproximations in the calculation of the free energy in\nthe two states.\nB. The Dense Phase\n\nIn the dense phase, the charges are very close to each\nother although it is likely that they retain a large amount\nof water. This phase is electroneutral and effectively\nforms a bulk region where the all the charges are strongly\ncorrelated with their near neighbors. In previous work12\nit was argued that a suitable free energy per unit volume\nFd for this state, is given by:\nFd (\u03a6, \u03a6/z, \u2212\u03a6) = \u2212M \u03a6.\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nln\n+ \u03c6Fe + Fs ,\nN\nN\n\nFs =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8i ln \u03c8i \u2212\n\n1 3\n\u03ba \u2212 g b ma\n12\u03c0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the screening length of the system and is given\nby\nX\n4\u03c0zi2 \u03c8i ,\n(7)\n\u03ba2 =\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M in an effective Madelung constant that depends\non the specific geometry of the polymer and ions used but\nthat reflects the strongly correlated state of the charges\nin that phase.\n\ni\n\nwhere the ionic densities \u03c8i with charges zi are ma , mn ,\ntef f and un .\nThe free energy of the near region of the polyelectrolyte, per monomer of electrolyte can be expressed as\nan expansion up to quadratic order on the fractions of\nassociated charges. A good choice for this functional is\n\nC. The dilute region\n\nThe dilute phase is not homogeneous at a microscopic\nlevel. The charge distribution is very different near the\npolyelectrolyte compared to regions away from it. The\nfree energy of this phase can be approximated by separating a region near the polymer from the rest of the\nsolvent. Since the polymer concentration is very dilute, this region can be considered as a separate thermodynamic system in equilibrium with an ion reservoir.\nThe amount of charge per monomer associated to the\n\nFe =\n\nG2 2\nq \u2212 gm fm \u2212 gt ft \u2212 gu fu + gc fm fu .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nTo argue for such functional it is convenient to separate\nwithin the near region of the electrolyte, the contributions to the free energy coming from a small region near\neach positive multivalent or monovalent ion, and the interaction of between these ions with others further away.\n4\n\n\fwhere the effective chemical potential pre monomer for\nthe addition of a neutral electrolyte complex into the dilute region is\n\nThe long range screened interaction between charges\ngives rise to the quadratic contribution G2 q 2 /2, where\nthe effective charge per monomer is q = 1 \u2212 fm + fu \u2212 ft .\nThe coefficient of interaction depends on the geometry of\nthe system and for simplicity is chosen to have the form\nG2 = G1 B ln((1 + \u03ba)/\u03ba), where G1 is a geometric factor.\nFor large screening lengths \u03ba\u22121 \u226b 1, this term reflects\nthe interaction of each charge with the logarithmic field\nof a charged rod of length \u03ba\u22121 . At very small screening\nlengths \u03ba\u22121 < 1 the function goes to 0.\nWhen the effective electrolyte charge is near zero the\nlinear terms in the free energy reflect the correlation energy of each charge with its near neighbors. At zero effective charge, the amount of energy gained from the addition of a unit charge from a given ion is simply \u2212gm , \u2212gs ,\nor \u2212gt . The association of a positive monovalent charge\nhas as prerequisite the presence of multivalent negative\nions associated to the electrolyte, so that fu < fm . The\nreduction in energy for this association is required to be\ncomparable (but smaller) to the energy of association for\nthese pairs of ions in the bulk so that gu < gb the positive\ncharge is brought into contact with a positive associated\nion but it is also in the neighborhood of the negatively\ncharged polyelectrolyte.\nThe reassociation of the multivalent ions and negative\ncoions influences the strong correlations between associated multivalent ions. As a larger number of monovalent\nions enter the near region, the multivalent ions reduce\nits correlations since their repulsion is diminished by the\npresence of the negative ions associated with them. This\nelement is reflected in the correlation reduction term gc .\nMore such terms describing corrections to the correlations can be written but it turns out that the inclusion\nof just this one is sufficient to recover a phase diagram\nthat is similar to those observed in experiments. Omission of this term leads to much more extended regions of\ncoexistence.\n\n\u03bc = \u2202\u03c6 Ft + (1/z)\u2202\u03c1 Ft \u2212 \u2202s Ft .\n\n(11)\n\nOn the basis of the assumption made, the final condition for the determination of the coexistence boundary\ndoes not explicitly depend on the concentrations in the\ndense phase given by \u03a6, but only on the bulk energy per\nelectrolyte charge \u2212M and the slope of the tie-line. The\nspecific value of \u03a6 is, nevertheless, important to determine the condensed electrolyte fraction x.\n\nB. Collapse\n\nIn a typical experiment performed to study the phase\ntransitions of this type of system, the amount of multivalent salt present is changed from 0 to some maximum\nvalue in small increments. The first transition occurs (for\nlow monovalent salt) when the amount of charge provided\nby the multivalent salt is approximately the same as the\namount of polyelectrolyte. If there is a large amount of\nmonovalent salt, the transition requires a larger amount\nof multivalent salt. Thus, it is possible to approximate\nthe location of the transition as follows: the condition\nEq.9 is satisfied almost as soon as full charge compensation of the electrolyte by multivalent ions occur. The\nchemical potential \u03bcm of the ions in the solution, disregarding the Debye Huckel contribution, is ln(m \u2212 fm \u03c6)\nwith fm \u2248 1. Thus, for low monovalent salt concentrations the condition is simply that there must be enough\nions to compensate the bare charge of the electrolyte:\n\nIV. DETERMINATION OF COEXISTENCE\nREGIONS\n\nzm \u2248 \u03c6.\n\n(12)\n\nA. Equilibrium between phases\n\nAt larger monovalent salt concentrations, the multivalent\nions must first displace associated positive monovalent\nions from the electrolyte. The reduction in the energy\nfrom the association of the monovalent and multivalent\nions is, per charge, approximately the same and thus the\nchemical potential in the solvent for the multivalent ions\nshould be smaller than that of the monovalent ions. The\ncondition for the charging of the electrolyte with multivalent ions, and a first approximation to the collapse\ntransition condition is:\n\nA state with concentrations (p, m, t) decomposes into\ntwo states if the following free energy, for some value of\nx, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, is smaller than the total energy of that\nstate.\nFcomp = xFd + Ft (\u03c6 \u2212 x\u03a6, \u03c1 \u2212 x\u03a6/z, s + \u03a6) \u2264 Ft (\u03c6, \u03c1, s).\n(9)\nThe boundary of the coexistence region is determined by\npoints at which the condition above is an equality and\nthe required value of x is zero. Expansion of Fcomp with\nrespect to x leads to\n\u2212M \u2212\u03bc<0\n\n1\nln m \u2248 ln(s + \u03c6).\nz\n\n(10)\n5\n\n(13)\n\n\fC. Redissolution\n\nIn solutions where even at large salt concentrations the\nfree energy of the ions is dominated by their translational\nentropy and there is little correlation between charges,\nthe redissolution transition occurs when the decrease in\nenergy per electrolyte due to multivalent ions overcharge\nis larger than the bulk correlation energy of the dense\nphase. However, if many monovalent ions are present,\nthe onset of association of the positive monovalent with\nnegative multivalent ions marks a sharp decrease in the\nenergy of the electrolyte. Not only there is a decrease in\nthe energy of the positive charges but also it is possible\nto associate many more ions. The repulsive interaction\nis decreased as the near region can be near neutral while\nhaving acquired large number of positive ions.\nTo first approximation, the onset of the association of\npositive ions occurs when the magnitude of the translational entropy of the free monovalent ions is comparable\nto the energy of association gb . At larger monovalent ion\nconcentrations, the charging of the electrolyte by positive\nmultivalent ions together with monovalent coions occurs\nwhen the energy of association gb is capable of compensating the translational entropy of the monovalent ions.\nThus we have\nln u = ln(zm + s) \u2248 \u2212gb .\n\nFIG. 4. The three solid curves correspond to the coexistence region boundary for three sections of the phase diagram in the (\u03c6, \u03c1, s) presentation, for different amounts of\nmonovalent salt, details in text. The largest amount of salt\nproduces the smallest coexistence region. All states outside\nthe boundary for each section have a negative net charge. For\nthe case with largest amount of monovalent salt the dotted\ncurve marks the border of the region where the multivalent\nions overcompensate the bare charge of the electrolyte.\n\n(14)\n\nIn this example, at the boundary of the redissolved region for the different values of monovalent salt added, the\nstates d, e and f are all overcharged with positive multivalent ions but the net charge of all these states is negative. For the choice of parameters made, all states of the\nsystem that are not decomposed (lying outside the coexistence curve for fixed amount of monovalent salt) have a\ntotal negative charge. Different choices of parameters can\nlead to different charged states and, for example, in systems where the energy of reassociation of the multivalent\nsalt is very small, all the dissociated states should have a\npositive effective charge, and the phase diagram has the\nshape proposed in work of Nguyen an Shklovskii21 , where\nthe lines of redissolution and collapse do not join to form\na bounded coexistence region. The model presented here\nalso predicts that there is a maximum value of monovalent salt for which there is a coexistence region. As in the\nscheme of Figure 2, the coexistence region has a limited\nextent in the s, t or u axes.\nFor the case of largest amount of monovalent salt\nadded, (with coexistence curve containing the points\n(e, f )), the dotted line divides the region of states that,\nwhile effectively negative, have enough multivalent ions\nto overcompensate the electrolyte bare charge. Separating curves for other salt concentration show similar behavior, always originating near the \"tip\" of the diagram.\nThe coexistence region sections are closed regions but\ntheir \"left\" boundaries lie at very small concentrations\nthat are typically experimentally inaccessible, and are\n\nThis expression provides a rough approximation for the\nlocation of the second transition. For fixed amounts of\nadded monovalent salt, the transition location is approximately a horizontal line in the (p,m) or (\u03c6, \u03c1) plane.\n\nD. A numerical example.\n\nThe results of a numerical minimization of the model\nfree energy appear in Figure 3. There it is shown, for\ndifferent values of the monovalent salt concentration, the\npredicted regions of coexistence in the (\u03c6, \u03c1) plane. The\nparameters used for this example are B = 3.0, gm = 9.0,\ngu = 9.0, gt = 9.6, gb = 1.5, gc = 1.8, M = 9.05. The\ncurve containing points a, and b has the lowest amount of\nadded monovalent salt s = 1.8 10\u22125 (intended to represent a 0.01 M molar concentration), the other two curves\nare for concentrations s = 9.0 10\u22125, and s = 1.810\u22124\n(0.05 M, and 0.1 M). The largest salt concentration leads\nto smaller coexistence regions. The marked pairs of\npoints (a, b), (c, d), and (e, f ) correspond to the location of the pairs of collapse-redissolution transitions that\noccur when for fixed amounts of monovalent salts and\nfixed amounts of polymer, multivalent salt is added to\nthe system.\n6\n\n\fspecific ionic species with the parameters used. Finally,\nthe addition of further ingredients that can directly modify the chemical potential of the different charged species\nshould also induce dramatic changes in the location a of\nthe transitions. From the point of view of the approach\npresented here, these modifications would be reflected in\nchanges of the phenomenological parameters used in the\nmodel.\n\nnot shown in Figure 4.\nIn extremely dilute solutions there is no large difference\nbetween the original concentration of ions in the bulk of\nthe solution and the effective concentrations obtained by\nsubtracting the associated ions. As the amount of polymer increases, the depletion from the bulk reduces the\namount of available ions and states with similar amounts\nof associated ions appear only at higher multivalent salt\nconcentrations. This leads to an upward curving trend\nin the redissolution curves.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nThe author thanks many useful talks with Monica\nOlvera de la Cruz, Eric Raspaud, Boris Shklovskii, Toan\nNguyen, Motohito Tanaka, Mark Stevens, and John\nWidom.\n\nIt is still an important but unfinished problem to refine the description of the layer of associated ions by both\nproviding a concrete definition of the layer and by testing\npossible (mean field) models of the free energy contribution of the layer to the total energy of the system. In the\ncontext of integral equation approaches this goal can be\nachieved by locating specific properties of the ion distribution functions18 , but ideally such definition ought to\nbe model independent and experimentally useful. Nevertheless, even with arbitrary definitions of the layer, a free\nenergy expansion of the form Eq. 8 is a useful instrument\nfor the analysis of this type of system.\nOne would like to reduce the large number of parameters used in the present description of the system as\nmany properties of real systems cannot be precisely measured or have a poor experimental definition. To use the\nideas presented here in the context of the real system requires the collapse of information about the interaction\nbetween molecules and monomers into a few simple constants. These quantities reflect the average radii of ions\nand are supposed to include the steric effects of water as\nwell as the specific location of charges in the electrolytes.\nA careful parametrization of simulation results, on the\nbasis of the charge of the near region of an electrolyte\nwas, for example, presented in the work of Messina et\nal.22 . In model systems studied though simulations or integral equations is possible to reduce the number of these\nparameters and calculate them on the basis of simpler geometric parameters. For comparison with experimental\ndata it is, however, preferable to retain these constants\nas adjustable parameters.\nA couple experimental tasks are suggested by this work\nas important to improve our understanding of these systems: the presentation of the data available from the\npoint of view of phase separation of ionic species (instead of salts), a more systematic mapping of the effective charge of the electrolytes in the redissolved region of the phase diagram, and determination of the\nionic composition of the associated layer (in this respect\nthere has been progress by means of osmotic pressure\nmeasurements23\u201326 ).
