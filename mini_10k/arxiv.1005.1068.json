Taken together, these observations suggest that short GRB progenitors belong to an old stellar population with a wide age\ndistribution, and generally track stellar mass. These results are fully consistent with NS-NS binary mergers and rule out a dominant\npopulation of prompt magnetars. However, a partial contribution from delayed magnetar formation or accretion-induced collapse\nis also consistent with the data.\nKeywords: gamma-ray burst, progenitor, host galaxy, neutron star binary\n\n1. Introduction\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short, intense and nonrepeating flashes of \u03b3-ray radiation originating at cosmological distances. While GRBs exhibit a broad diversity in their\nprompt \u03b3-ray emission (e.g., duration, spectral shape, peak energy, brightness), they can still be divided into two basic categories: short-duration and long-duration with a separation at\nabout 2 sec (Kouveliotou et al., 1993). The short GRBs have\ndurations as short as \u223c 10 msec, while the long events extend\nto hundreds of seconds. In addition, short GRBs tend to exhibit\nharder \u03b3-ray spectra than the long-duration events, and generally have a lower fluences.\nThe basic bimodality of GRB durations provided an early\nclue that the progenitors of the two classes are likely to\nbe distinct. Within the broad range of possible scenarios,\ntwo popular models have emerged: The collapse of rapidlyrotating massive stars (\"collapsars\"; (MacFadyen and Woosley,\n1999)) in the case of long GRBs, and the coalescence of\ncompact object binaries (with neutron star and/or black hole\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor\n\nPreprint submitted to New Astronomy\n\nconstituents \u2013 NS-NS/NS-BH; (Eichler et al., 1989; Paczynski,\n1991; Narayan et al., 1992)) in the case of short GRBs. The key\nattractions of this mapping are the potential for a large energy\nrelease from both progenitor classes, and the expected typical\ntimescale for each progenitor: A free-fall timescale of t f f \u2248\n30 s (M/10 M\u2299)\u22121/2 (R/1010 cm)3/2 for collapsars, and a dynamical timescale of milliseconds for the compact merger remnants\nof neutron stars and black holes. However, other progenitor\nsystems have also been proposed for short GRBs, for example\nmagnetars, thought to be the power source behind soft \u03b3-ray repeaters (Thompson and Duncan, 1995), accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of neutron stars (Qin et al., 1998), and delayed\nmagnetar formation through binary white dwarf mergers or\nwhite dwarf AIC (Levan et al., 2006; Metzger et al., 2008).\nUntil a decade ago, the distances, energy scale, geometry, environments, and progenitors of GRBs, as well as the\nrelation between the two burst classes, remained uncertain\ndue to the lack of precise positions. The discovery of longwavelength, long-lived \"afterglows\" from long GRBs in 1997\nprovided the first glimpse at these properties (Costa et al., 1997;\nFrail et al., 1997; van Paradijs et al., 1997). Indeed, the subarcsecond positions enabled by long GRB afterglow detections\nMarch 1, 2018\n\n\fdemonstrated a cosmological origin (Metzger et al., 1997), an\nenergy scale of \u223c 1051 erg (Frail et al., 2001; Berger et al.,\n2003a,b; Bloom et al., 2003), significant collimation (\u223c 10\u25e6\njets; (Harrison et al., 1999; Stanek et al., 1999)), and direct evidence for relativistic expansion (Taylor et al., 2004). Intense\nafterglow and host galaxy observations also linked long GRBs\nwith the deaths of massive stars, mainly through their exclusive location in star forming galaxies (e.g., (Bloom et al., 1998;\nDjorgovski et al., 1998; Fruchter et al., 1999)), their strong correlation with the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) light of their hosts\n(Bloom et al., 2002; Fruchter et al., 2006), and their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (Hjorth et al., 2003;\nStanek et al., 2003).\nThe afterglows of short GRBs were discovered only in 2005.\nPrior to that point only a few afterglow searches were possible\ndue to the relative faintness of the \u03b3-ray emission, and hence a\nlow event rate and large and delayed error circles (Hurley et al.,\n2002). In retrospect, these searches were woefully inadequate,\nreaching only about 21 mag at \u03b4t \u2248 1 day in the optical and\n\u223c 0.5 mJy at \u03b4t \u2248 few days in the radio. The launch of NASA's\nSwift satellite in late 2004, provided the first chance for rapid\nand accurate positions for short GRBs, and indeed led to the\ndetection of the first X-ray (Gehrels et al., 2005; Bloom et al.,\n2006), optical (Fox et al., 2005; Hjorth et al., 2005), and radio\n(Berger et al., 2005) afterglows in 2005.\nAs in the case of long GRBs, the determination of accurate positions revolutionized the study of short GRBs. First,\nit led to an association with galaxies at cosmological distances\n(e.g., (Berger et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2005; Hjorth et al., 2005;\nBloom et al., 2006; Prochaska et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2007))\nand hence an energy scale of \u223c 1049 \u2212 1052 erg (assuming\nisotropy) (Berger, 2007; Nakar, 2007). Second, it led to the\nassociation of some events with elliptical galaxies pointing to\nan old progenitor population (Berger et al., 2005; Gehrels et al.,\n2005; Bloom et al., 2006). Third, it demonstrated that the afterglow emission is similar to that of long GRBs, albeit with a\ngenerally lower luminosity (Berger et al., 2005). Finally, it provided a rough estimate of the short GRB event rate (Nakar et al.,\n2006).\nDespite these fundamental results the progenitors of short\nGRBs remain unidentified at the present. The key observational\ntest of the NS-NS/NS-BH merger model, the detection of coincident gravitational waves, is at least several years away. Similarly, theoretical predictions of early optical/UV emission from\nan accompanying \"mini-supernova\" (Li and Paczy\u0144ski, 1998),\ncaused by the ejection of radioactive material from the merging system, are highly uncertain, and even the most optimistic\npredictions lead to a faint and rapidly-fading signal that may\nbe challenging to detect. Thus, the most promising avenue for\nprogress at the present comes from statistical studies of the environments of short GRBs, both on galactic and sub-galactic\nscales (e.g., (Prochaska et al., 2006; Berger, 2009; Fong et al.,\n2010)). These studies benefit from many of the same techniques\nthat linked long GRBs with the death of massive stars, and allow for comparison with theoretical predictions.\nIn this review, I present the current state of our knowledge\nabout the redshift distribution of short GRBs, the demographics\n\nand detailed properties of their host galaxies, and their locations\nwithin their hosts. The structure of this review is as follows. In\n\u00a72 I summarize the discovery of short GRB afterglows, and the\nsubsequent identifications of their host galaxies and redshifts;\nthe detailed properties of the hosts (luminosities, metallicities,\nstar formation rates, masses, stellar population ages) are discussed in \u00a73 and \u00a74; in \u00a75 I discuss the sub-galactic environments of short GRBs, utilizing mainly high-resolution Hubble\nSpace Telescope observations; I discuss the possibility of large\nprogenitor offsets (due to kicks or globular cluster origin) in \u00a76;\nand finally, in \u00a77 I use these results to place constraints on the\nprogenitor population.\n2. The Discovery of Short GRB Afterglows, Host Galaxies,\nand Redshifts\nThe discovery of short GRB afterglows starting in May 2005\nled to the first identifications of their host galaxies and hence\nto distance measurements. The first short GRB with an afterglow detection, GRB 050509B, was localized to a positional\naccuracy of about 5\u2032\u2032 with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT)\n(Gehrels et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2006). No optical or radio\nemission was detected. The X-ray error circle appeared to coincide with the outskirts of an elliptical galaxy at z = 0.226\n(Gehrels et al., 2005; Hjorth et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2006),\nwith a probability of chance coincidence of \u223c 10\u22123 . However,\nthe error circle contained additional fainter galaxies possibly at\nhigher redshift.\nOnly two months later, GRB 050709 was the first short burst\nlocalized to sub-arcsecond precision through the detection of\nX-ray (with Chandra) and optical emission (Fox et al., 2005;\nHjorth et al., 2005). The resulting afterglow position coincided with the outskirts of an irregular star forming galaxy at\nz = 0.161 (Fox et al., 2005; Covino et al., 2006). Despite the\non-going star formation activity within the host galaxy, the burst\nwas not accompanied by a supernova explosion, indicating that\nthe progenitor was not likely to be a massive star (Fox et al.,\n2005; Hjorth et al., 2005). However, due to the presence of\nactive star formation, an association with a young progenitor\nsystem such as a magnetar could not be excluded.\nMagellan/PANIC\n2005 July 25.01\n\n2005 July 27.15\n\nResidual\n\nN\n19.8 kpc\n5\"\n\nFigure 1: Discovery images of the near-infrared afterglow of GRB 050724 and\nits elliptical host galaxy.

At\nthe present, 16 redshifts have been measured between the two\nsamples (Figures 4 and 5).\nThe events with only X-ray positions have two shortcomings.\nFirst, the probability of chance coincidence for the typical host\nmagnitudes within the XRT error circles (\u223c 21 \u2212 26 mag) is\n\u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 1. Second, in some cases there is disagreement about\nthe position and radius of the XRT error circles between various\ngroups, leading to systematic uncertainties in host associations.\nLuckily, in the subsequent discussion of detailed host properties no substantial difference in the sample with and without\noptical afterglows is found, suggesting that any spurious galaxy\nassociations are at most a minor contaminant.\nUsing optical follow-up observations of nine short GRBs\nwith X-ray and/or optical afterglows (available by the end of\n2006), Berger et al. (2007) found that eight of the nine bursts\nwere likely associated with much fainter galaxies (R \u223c 23 \u2212 26\nmag) than the first few events. By comparison to this early\nsample (with R \u223c 17 \u2212 22 mag and z . 0.5), as well as\nthe hosts of long GRBs and large field galaxy samples, it was\ndemonstrated that these new host galaxies likely reside at z \u223c 1\nand beyond. A specific early case for a z & 1 origin was\nGRB 060121 based on afterglow photometric redshift estimates\n(de Ugarte Postigo et al., 2006; Levan et al., 2006). Spectroscopic redshifts for the four brightest galaxies in this expanded\nsample led to measurements of z \u2248 0.4 \u2212 1.1 (Berger et al.,\n2007); see Figure 4. Subsequent observations have con-\n\nThe combination of low redshifts (z \u223c 0.2) and the apparent dominance of elliptical galaxies in the first few short\nGRB hosts led to initial speculation of a particularly old progenitor population: \u03c4 & 4 Gyr (Nakar et al., 2006), \u03c4 & 7\nGyr (Zheng and Ramirez-Ruiz, 2007), and \u03c4 & several Gyr\n(Gal-Yam et al., 2008). Indeed, a possible inconsistency with\nthe expected merger time delay distribution of NS-NS binaries\nwas noted (Nakar et al., 2006), although subsequent population\nsynthesis models of NS-NS binary formation and mergers led to\nopposite claims (Belczynski et al., 2006). Clearly, the sample\nof short GRBs with afterglow detections available when these\nvarious claims were published was very small (GRBs 050509B,\n050709, 050724, and 051221A).\nFortunately, the continued detection of short GRBs (mainly,\nthough not exclusively by Swift), coupled with a communitywide concerted effort to discover and study their afterglows, led\nto a substantial increase in the sample of events over the past\n5 years (e.g., Figures 2 and 3). Studies of this sample have\nled to a re-evaluation of the host galaxy demographics and the\nredshift distribution (e.g., (Berger et al., 2007)). In particular,\nas of late 2010, the sample of short GRBs with X-ray detections\n(positions of \u223c 2 \u2212 5\u2032\u2032 radius) numbers about 40.

In Figure 6 I show the isotropic-equivalent afterglow Xray luminosities of short GRBs as a function of their isotropicequivalent \u03b3-ray energies. The former is a proxy for the afterglow kinetic energy (Kumar, 2000; Freedman and Waxman,\n2001; Berger et al., 2003a).

Due to\nthe general faintness of short GRB afterglows, strong evidence\nfor collimation exists in only one case (Soderberg et al., 2006;\nBurrows et al., 2006), but additional cases are possible (Berger,\n2007).\n\n7500\n\nFigure 4: Optical spectra of several short GRB host galaxies.

(2006); D'Avanzo et al.\n(2009).\nI use the standard metallicity diagnostics,\nR23 \u2261 [(F[OII]\u03bb3727 + F[OIII]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007 )/FH\u03b2 ] (Pagel et al.,\n1979; Kobulnicky and Kewley, 2004) and F[NII]\u03bb6584 /FH\u03b1 . The\nvalue of R23 depends on both the metallicity and ionization\nstate of the gas, which is determined using the ratio of oxygen\nlines, O32 \u2261 F[OIII]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007 /F[OII]\u03bb3727 . I note that the R23\ndiagnostic is double-valued with low and high metallicity\nbranches (e.g., (Kewley and Dopita, 2002)). This degeneracy\ncan be broken using the ratio [NII]/H\u03b1 when these lines are\naccessible. To facilitate a subsequent comparison with field\ngalaxy samples I use the R23 , O32 , and [NII]/H\u03b1 calibrations\nof Kobulnicky and Kewley (2004). The typical uncertainty\ninherent in the calibrations is about 0.1 dex.\nAdopting the solar metallicity from Asplund et al. (2005),\n12 + log(O/H) = 8.66 Berger (2009) find 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.6\nfor the upper R23 branch and \u2248 8.0 \u2212 8.5 for the lower branch\nfor the host of GRB 061006. For the host of GRB 070724 they\nfind 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.9 for the upper branch, and \u2248 7.6 \u2212 8.1\nfor the lower branch. A similar range of values is found for\nthe host of GRB 061210, but the ratio F[NII] /FH\u03b1 \u2248 0.2, indicates 12 + log(O/H) & 8.6, thereby breaking the degeneracy\nand leading to the upper branch solution, 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.9.\nFor the host of GRB 051221A (Soderberg et al., 2006), similar\nvalues to those for the host of GRB 070724 are inferred. Finally, for the host galaxy of GRB 050709, the [NII]/H\u03b1 ratio\nindicates 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.5. The dominant source of uncertainty in this measurement is the unknown value of O32 , but\nusing a spread of a full order of magnitude results in a metallicity uncertainty of 0.2 dex. For the hosts with double-valued\nmetallicities (GRBs 051221A, 061006, and 070724) I follow\nthe conclusion for field galaxies of similar luminosities and redshifts that the appropriate values are those for the R23 upper\nbranch (Kobulnicky and Kewley, 2004). This conclusions was\nadvocated by Kobulnicky and Kewley (2004) based on galaxies\nin their sample with measurements of both R23 and [NII]/H\u03b1.\nIt is similarly supported by our inference for the host galaxy of\nGRB 061210. Future near-IR spectroscopy covering the [NII]\nand H\u03b1 lines will test this hypothesis. The metallicities as a\nfunction of host luminosity are shown in Figure 8.\nTo place the host galaxies of short GRBs in a broader context I compare their properties with those of long GRB hosts\nand field star forming galaxies from the GOODS-N survey\n(Kobulnicky and Kewley, 2004). In terms of absolute magnitudes, the long GRB hosts range from MB \u2248 \u221216 to \u221222 mag,\nwith a median value of hMB i \u2248 \u221219.2 mag (hLB i \u2248 0.2 L\u2217 ;\n(Berger et al., 2007)). Thus, the long GRB hosts extend to\nlower luminosities than the short GRB hosts, with a median\nvalue that is about 1.1 mag fainter. A K-S test indicates that the\nprobability that the short and long GRB hosts are drawn from\n\nare undergoing active star formation (Figure 4; (Berger et al.,\n2007; D'Avanzo et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2009)). Indeed, in\nthe sample of short GRBs localized to better than a few arcseconds about 50% of the bursts occur in star forming galaxies\ncompared to only \u2248 10% in elliptical galaxies; the remaining\n\u2248 40% are currently unclassified due to their faintness, a lack of\nobvious spectroscopic features, or the absence of deep followup observations. This result raises the question of whether some\nshort GRBs are related to star formation activity rather than to\nan old stellar population, and if so, whether the star formation\nproperties are similar to those in long GRB host galaxies. The\nanswer will shed light on the diversity of short GRB progenitors.\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nSFR/L\n\n0.8\nCumulative\n\nSFR/LB (M0/yr LB*)\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0 0\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1\nRedshift\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFigure 7: Specific star formation rates as a function of redshift for the host\ngalaxies of short GRBs (black squares), long GRBs (blue circles) and field\ngalaxies from the GOODS-N survey (red crosses; (Kobulnicky and Kewley,\n2004)).

From Berger (2009).\n\nIn the following discussion, I compare several aspect of short\nand long GRB host galaxies: Luminosities, metallicities, and\nstar formation rates. A comparison of the masses and stellar population ages is carried out in the subsequent section.\nFor the current sample of short GRB hosts, the distribution\nof absolute rest-frame B-band magnitudes (MB ) ranges from\nabout 0.1 to a few L\u2217 (Berger, 2009; Prochaska et al., 2006).\nThe star formation rates (mostly inferred from the [OII]\u03bb3727\nline using the standard conversion (Kennicutt, 1998); Figure 4) range from about 0.1 to 10 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the star forming hosts (Berger, 2009; D'Avanzo et al., 2009). In the case\nof the elliptical hosts the upper limits are . 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n(Berger et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2006; Prochaska et al., 2006;\nBerger, 2009). Combined with the absolute magnitudes, the\nspecific star formation rates (SSFR) are SFR/LB \u2248 1 \u2212 10 M\u2299\n\u22121 \u22121\nyr\u22121 L\u22121\nL\u2217 for\n\u2217 for the star forming hosts, and . 0.03 M\u2299 yr\nthe elliptical hosts. The SSFR values as a function of redshift\nare shown in Figure 7.\n\n1 A sixth host, GRB 071227, has an inferred metallicity of about 0.4 \u2212 1\nZ\u2299 , but this was inferred in the absence of detected hydrogen Balmer lines\n(D'Avanzo et al., 2009), and the values are therefore prone to large systematic\nerrors.\n\n5\n\n\f2004; Tremonti et al., 2004)). The two hosts with MB \u2248 \u221218\nmag have 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.6, while those with MB \u2248 \u221220 to\n\u221221 mag have 12 + log(O/H) \u2248 8.8 \u2212 8.9, following the general\ntrend. On the other hand, the short GRB host metallicities are\nsystematically higher than those of long GRB hosts, which have\nbeen argued to have lower than expected values (Stanek et al.,\n2006). The median metallicity of short GRB hosts is about 0.6\ndex higher than for long GRB hosts, and there is essentially no\noverlap between the two host populations (Berger, 2009).\nTo conclude, the short GRB host sample is dominated by\nstar forming galaxies, but these galaxies have higher luminosities, lower star formation rates and specific star formation rates,\nand higher metallicities than the star forming host galaxies of\nlong GRBs. Instead, the short GRB host sample appears to be\ndrawn from the field galaxy population. These results suggest\nthat while short GRB hosts are mainly star forming galaxies, the\nprogenitors most likely trace stellar mass rather than the modest\non-going star formation activity.\n\n9.2\n9\n\n12+log(O/H)\n\n8.8\n8.6\n8.4\n8.2\nShort GRBs\nLong GRBs\n\n8\n\nz \u223c 0.3\u22121\n\n7.8\n\nSDSS\n\n\u221216\n\n\u221217\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221219\n\u221220\nM(B) (mag)\n\n\u221221\n\n\u221222\n\nFigure 8: Metallicity as a function of B-band absolute magnitude for the host\ngalaxies of short GRBs (black squares) and long GRBs (blue circles).

Both field samples exhibit a clear luminosity-metallicity relation. The\nlong GRB hosts tend to exhibit lower than expected metallicities (Stanek et al.,\n2006), while the hosts of short GRBs have higher metallicities by about 0.6\ndex, are moreover in excellent agreement with the luminosity-metallicity relation. From Berger (2009).\n\n4. Host Galaxy Stellar Masses and Ages\nTo more comprehensively address whether short GRBs trace\nstellar mass alone (as would be expected for an old progenitor population), it is essential to determine the stellar masses\nand population ages of short GRB host galaxies, primarily in\ncomparison to the general galaxy stellar mass function. This\nanalysis was recently carried out by Leibler and Berger (2010)\nusing multi-band optical and near-IR data for 19 short GRB\nhosts. The resulting spectral energy distributions were fit with\nthe Maraston (2005) stellar population models to extract two\ncrucial parameters: stellar mass (M\u2217 ) and population age (\u03c4).\nThe range of possible masses was assessed using three approaches. First, using single stellar population (SSP) fits, which\nprovide an adequate representation for the early-type hosts, but\ntend to under-estimate the total mass and population age of starforming hosts. At the other extreme, the near-IR data alone\nwere modeled with a stellar population matched to the age of\nthe universe at each host redshift. This approach uses the maximum possible mass-to-light ratio to extract a maximal mass for\neach host galaxy. Finally, as a more realistic estimate for the\nstar-forming hosts, hybrid young+old stellar populations were\nused. Examples of all three approaches are shown for the host\nof GRB 050709 in Figure 9.\nThe resulting mass distributions are shown in Figure 10. For\ncomparison I also present the mass distributions for long GRB\nhosts, which were analyzed with the same models for the purpose of a uniform comparison. The SSP masses span three orders of magnitude, MSSP \u2248 6 \u00d7 108 \u2212 4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , with a\nmedian value of hMSSP i \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . Dividing the sample into early- and late-type host galaxies, the former span the\nrange MSSP \u2248 (2 \u2212 40) \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , while the latter have much\nlower masses of MSSP \u2248 (0.06 \u2212 2) \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . The clear distinction between the two samples partially reflects the bias of\nsingle age SSP models, which for the late-type hosts are dominated by the young stellar population and hence under-estimate\nthe contribution of any older stellar populations. For the maximal masses the range is MMax \u2248 6 \u00d7 109 \u2212 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . The\n\nthe same underlying distribution is 0.1. On the other hand, a\ncomparison to the GOODS-N sample reveals a similar distribution, and the K-S probability that the short GRB hosts are\ndrawn from the field sample is 0.6 (Berger, 2009).\nA similar conclusion is reached based on a comparison of\nspecific star formation rates (Berger, 2009). For long GRB\nhosts the inferred star formation rates range from about 0.2 to\n50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , and their specific star formation rates are about\n\u22121\n3 \u2212 40 M\u2299 yr\u22121 L\u22121\n\u2217 , with a median value of about 10 M\u2299 yr\n\u22121\nL\u2217 (Christensen et al., 2004). As shown in Figure 7, the specific star formation rates of short GRB hosts are systematically\nbelow those of long GRB hosts, with a median value that is\nnearly an order of magnitude lower. Indeed, the K-S probability that the short and long GRB hosts are drawn from the same\nunderlying distribution is only 0.003 (Berger, 2009). This is\nclearly seen from the cumulative distributions of specific star\nformation rates for each sample (inset of Figure 7). On the\nother hand, a comparison to the specific star formation rates of\nthe GOODS-N field galaxies reveals excellent agreement (Figure 7). The K-S probability that the short GRB hosts are drawn\nfrom the field galaxy distribution is 0.6. Thus, short GRB hosts\nappear to be drawn from the normal population of star forming\ngalaxies at z . 1, in contrast to long GRB hosts, which have\nelevated specific star formation rates, likely as a result of preferentially young starburst populations (Christensen et al., 2004;\nSavaglio et al., 2008).\nFinally, the metallicities measured for short GRB hosts are in\nexcellent agreement with the luminosity-metallicity relation for\nfield galaxies at z \u223c 0.1 \u22121 (Figure 8; (Kobulnicky and Kewley,\n6\n\n\f050709\n\n050709\n\n050709\n\u221217\n\nYoung+Old\n\n\u221218\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nWavelength (Ang)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nMax\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\nF\u03bb (erg/cm /s/Ang)\n\n\u03bb\n\nF (erg/cm2/s/Ang)\n\n\u221217\n\n10\n\nSSP\n\nF\u03bb (erg/cm /s/Ang)\n\n\u221217\n\n10\n\n\u221218\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nWavelength (\u03bcm)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\u221218\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nWavelength (Ang)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 9: Optical and near-IR spectral energy distribution of GRB 050709 with the three models used to extract the stellar mass and population age.

Center: Young+Old SSP model (magenta=old;\ncyan=young) with the old population age fixed at the age of the universe at the redshift of the burst (z = 0.161 in this case). Right: Maximal mass model with the\npopulation age fixed at the age of the universe and using only the K-band photometry. The Young+Old model leads to total masses intermediate between the single\nage SSP and the maximal models, and has younger ages for the young population than the single age SSP model. From Leibler and Berger (2010).\n\nmedian mass is hMMax i \u2248 1\u00d71011 M\u2299 , about an order of magnitude larger than for the single age SSP masses, and only slightly\nlarger than the stellar mass of the Milky Way. As expected, the\nratios of maximal to SSP masses for the early-type hosts are\nmodest, MMax /MSSP \u2248 2 \u2212 8, since these hosts are already dominated by old stellar populations. However, for the late-type\nhosts the corrections are significant, MMax /MSSP \u2248 5 \u2212 60, with\na median ratio of about an order of magnitude. Finally, using\nthe young+old models for the late-type hosts, and the single\nage SSP values for the early-type hosts, the resulting masses\nare M \u2248 2 \u00d7 109 \u2212 4 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , with a median of hMi \u2248 5 \u00d7 1010\nM\u2299 .\nStellar population ages can only be inferred for the single\nage SSP models since for the maximal and young+old models\nthe inherent assumption is a population with the age of the universe at each host redshift. The distribution of ages is shown\nin Figure 11, with the values ranging from about 30 Myr to 4.4\nGyr. The median age is h\u03c4SSP i \u2248 0.3 Gyr for the full sample,\nwith h\u03c4SSP i \u2248 0.25 Gyr for the subset of late-type hosts and\nh\u03c4SSP i \u2248 3 Gyr for the subset of early-type hosts.\nThe long GRB hosts, on the other hand, have lower masses\nand younger population ages. For the SSP model the mass\nrange is MSSP \u2248 6 \u00d7 106 \u2212 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , with a median value\nof hMSSP i \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (Figure 10). The maximal masses\nspan MMax \u2248 9 \u00d7 107 \u2212 9 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , with a median value of\nhMMax i \u2248 4.0 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (Figure 10). The SSP stellar population ages span about 10 to 570 Myr, with a median value of\nh\u03c4SSP i \u2248 65 Myr.\n\nobtaining this ratio from an intrinsic one-to-one distribution is\nonly 0.04. The identity of the remaining 9 hosts is unclear at the\npresent due to their faintness or the lack of underlying galaxies\nat the burst positions. Still, unless nearly all of these bursts\nwere hosted by early-type galaxies, the resulting ratio appears\nto be skewed in favor of late-type host galaxies with on-going\nstar formation activity. The same result holds true even when\nconsidering the bursts with only X-ray afterglow positions and\nidentified hosts.\nThus, the host galaxy demographics suggest that short GRBs\ndo not track stellar mass alone, or phrased alternatively, they\ndo not have a delay time distribution that is skewed to old ages\nof \u223c few Gyr. It is possible, however, that this result is influenced by secondary factors such as the typical circumburst\ndensity or intrinsic differences in the energy scale and afterglow brightness as a function of galaxy type (possibly reminiscent of the differences in peak luminosity for Type Ia supernovae in early- and late-type galaxies; (Hamuy et al., 2000;\nMannucci et al., 2006)). If such differences lead to fainter afterglows (or prompt emission) for short GRBs in early-type galaxies, this would suppress the early-type fraction. Although the\nmodest size of the host sample, and the substantial fraction of\nshort GRBs with only \u03b3-ray positions (\u223c 1/3 of all events), prevent definitive conclusions, it does not appear that the optical\nafterglows of short GRBs in early- and late-type galaxies are\ndistinct (Berger, 2010); see \u00a76.\n\n4.1. Host Demographics\n\nI next turn to a comparison of the inferred stellar masses\nwith the galaxy mass function (Leibler and Berger, 2010). The\ncumulative distribution of stellar masses for the short GRB\nhosts is shown in Figure 12 with the range of possible masses\nbounded by the single age SSP and maximal values. I also\npresent a breakdown of the sample into early- and late-type\ngalaxies, each spanning the same range. For the late-type hosts,\nthe intermediate young+old values are also shown. To compare these distributions to the distribution of galaxy masses I\nalso plot the cumulative stellar mass function weighted by mass,\ni.e., the fraction of stellar mass in galaxies above some mass,\n\n4.2. Comparison to the Galaxy Mass Function\n\nIn the redshift range relevant for short GRBs (z \u223c 0.2 \u2212 1)\nroughly an equal fraction of the cosmic stellar mass budget resides in early- and late-type galaxies (e.g., (Ilbert et al., 2010)).\nTherefore, if short GRBs track stellar mass alone we expect\na roughly one-to-one ratio of galaxy types. This does not appear to be the case. For example, within the sample of short\nGRBs with optical afterglows (20 events), only 2 are unambiguously hosted by early-type galaxies (GRBs 050724 and\n100117; (Berger et al., 2005), Fong et al. in prep.), while 8 are\nunambiguously hosted by late-type galaxies; the probability of\n7\n\n\fNumber\n\n5\n\n9\n\n0.8\n\n8\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n4\n\nPKS\u2248 0.11\n\n7\n\nLong GRBs: SSP (\u22121.2)\n\n3\n\nKS\n\nPKS\u2248 0.006\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n6\n\n8 9 10 11 12\nlog [M/Msun]\n\n\u22124\n\nP \u2248 9\u00d710\n\n0.8\n\nShort GRBs: late (\u22120.6)\n\n7\n\nPKS\u2248 0.006\n\n1\n\nShort GRBs: SSP (\u22120.5)\nf(>age)\n\n6\n\n1\n\nNumber\n\nShort GRBs: SSP (10.1)\nShort GRBs: late (9.5)\nLong GRBs: SSP (9.1)\n\nf(>M)\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n0\nlog [age / Gyr]\n\n1\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n0\n6.5\n10\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n0\n\u22122.5\n\n9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5\nlog [M / Msun]\n\n1\n0.8\n\n8\n\n0.6\n\nf(>M)\n\n9\n\n7\nNumber\n\n7\n\n6\n\nShort GRBs: late (10.5)\nLong GRBs: Max (9.6)\n\u22126\n\n0\n\n5\n\nPKS\u2248 4\u00d710\n\n\u22125\n\nPKS\u2248 4\u00d710\n\n7\n\n8 9 10 11 12\nlog [M/M ]\n\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\nlog [age / Gyr]\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nsun\n\n4\n\nM\u2299 , \u03b1 = \u22121.16); the Bell et al.

Comparison to Long GRB Hosts\nDespite the possibility that some short GRB progenitors may\ntrack star formation activity, the inferred stellar masses and\npopulation ages of short GRB hosts are generally distinct from\nthose of long GRB hosts in both the single age SSP and maximal models (Leibler and Berger, 2010). Most importantly, this\nis true for the subset of late-type hosts. In the framework of the\nsingle age SSP model the K-S probability is only 0.006 that the\nlong and short GRB hosts are drawn from the same mass distribution. The probability is higher for the subset of late-type\nshort GRB hosts, P \u2248 0.1 (Figure 10). However, since the SSP\nvalues represent the mass of only the young stellar populations,\nthey are mostly reflective of the star formation activity rather\nthan the total stellar mass. Using instead the maximal masses,\nthe K-S probability that the long GRB hosts and late-type hosts\nof short GRBs are drawn from the same sample is negligible,\nP \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 (Figure 10), demonstrating that they are distinct\ngalaxy populations. A similar conclusion is apparent from a\ncomparison of the single age SSP population ages. The K-S\nprobability that the long GRB hosts and late-type hosts of short\nGRBs are drawn from the same distribution is only P \u2248 0.006.\nThus, the long GRB hosts have significantly lower stellar\nmasses than the subset of late-type short GRB hosts, and their\nyoung stellar population are significantly younger. Indeed,\na comparison of the long GRB host maximal masses to the\nIlbert et al. (2010) mass function of high-activity galaxies at\nz \u223c 0.7 (appropriate for the long GRB sample considered here)\nindicates a K-S probability of only 0.002 that the long GRB\nhosts are drawn from the galaxy mass function. This is consistent with our understanding that their massive star progenitors\nselect galaxies by star formation (and perhaps additional factors\nsuch as metallicity), but not by stellar mass.\nThe apparent distinction between long GRB hosts and the\nlate-type hosts of short GRBs in terms of their stellar masses\nand young population ages strengthens the conclusion in \u00a73\nbased on the star formation rates, specific star formation rates,\nluminosities, and metallicities (Berger, 2009). In essentially every property the late-type short GRB hosts point to a population\nof more quiescent, massive, and evolved galaxies than the hosts\nof long GRBs. I therefore conclude that this rules out the idea\nthat short GRB progenitors in late-type hosts are massive stars\nidentical to long GRB progenitors (Virgili et al., 2009), even if\nthe short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track star formation\nrather than stellar mass.\n\nBell et al. 2003 (late)\nIlbert et al. 2010 (quiescent)\nIlbert et al. 2010 (intermediate)\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\nf(>M)\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.2\n\nSSP (all)\nYoung+Old / SSP (all)\nMax (all)\n\n0.1\n\nCole et al. 2001/Panter et al. 2004 (all)\n\n0.3\n\n0\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\n\n9.5\n10\n10.5\nlog [M / Msun]\n\n11\n\n11.5\n\n12\n\nFigure 12: Cumulative distributions for the full sample of single age simple\nstellar population (SSP) masses, maximal masses, and combined young+old\nand SSP masses for the late- and early-type hosts, respectively (black; bottom\npanel). The upper panel shows a breakdown by galaxy type (late-type: blue;\nearly-type: red). The shaded regions represent the range of possible stellar\nmasses since the SSP masses, which are effectively light-weighted values, are\nmost likely an under-estimate, while the maximal masses make the extreme\nassumption that all hosts are dominated by populations with the age of the universe. For the late-type hosts the total masses from a young+old SSP fit are\nalso shown; these are more closely representative of the total mass. Also shown\nare the fractions of total stellar mass in galaxies with mass, > M, calculated\nfrom several published galaxy stellar mass functions at z \u223c 0 \u2212 2 (cyan and magenta lines; (Cole et al., 2001; Bell et al., 2003; Panter et al., 2004; Ilbert et al.,\n2010)); for the Ilbert et al. (2010) mass function the z \u223c 0.5 bin is used, appropriate for the short GRB sample, and separately plot the mass function for\nquiescent galaxies and for intermediate-activity galaxies, which resemble the\nintermediate star formation activity in short GRB hosts (Berger, 2009). The\ncomparison indicates that short GRBs trace galaxy mass only if the bulk of the\nlate-type hosts have close to maximal masses. The subset of early-type hosts\nappears to faithfully trace the mass function of galaxies for the SSP-derived\nmasses. From Leibler and Berger (2010).\n\nis marginally consistent (P \u2248 0.1).\nTo summarize, the distribution of short GRB host masses is\ncompatible with the overall mass distribution of galaxies only\nif their stellar masses are given by the SSP masses for the earlytype hosts and the maximal or young+old masses for the latetype hosts. Since the opposite scenario (maximal masses for\nthe early-type hosts and SSP masses for the late-type hosts)\nis unlikely, the existing sample of short GRB hosts is consistent with the galaxy mass function (Leibler and Berger, 2010).\nEquivalently, this means that short GRBs may indeed track stellar mass alone. However, I caution that the host demographics\nseem to be at odds with the expected equal fractions of total\nstellar mass in early- and late-type galaxies, unless nearly all\n\n4.4. The Delay Time Distribution\nA determination of the delay function from the derived stellar population ages is complicated by two primary factors. First,\nthey rely on the assumption that the short GRB progenitors in\neach host were formed within the inferred stellar population.\n9\n\n\fThis assumption is justified statistically both for an association\nof the progenitors with stellar mass and with star formation activity, as long as we can appropriately normalize the rates of\nshort GRBs. Second, while it is possible to determine single age\nSSP ages from the broad-band photometry, these data are not\nsufficient to provide an age breakdown (by mass) for multiple\nstellar components. Indeed, for the hybrid young+old model,\nthe age of the old population has to be fixed (to the age of the\nuniverse in the analysis of Leibler and Berger (2010)). Still, in\nthe young+old model, the bulk of the mass (\u2248 55 \u2212 99%) is\ncontained in the old stellar population, and so the progenitors\nwould have \"old\" ages (\u03c4 & \u03c4SSP ) if they tracked stellar mass.\nAs a result of these limitations it is only possible to explore\nthe implications of two main scenarios, namely that short GRBs\ntrack mass and/or star formation activity. In the context of the\nformer scenario I have shown in \u00a74.2 that the short GRBs in\nearly-type hosts trace stellar mass. Therefore, their SSP ages\ncan be used to provide a rough estimate of the progenitor ages,\n\u03c4 \u2248 0.8 \u2212 4.4 Gyr, with a median of about 3 Gyr. On the other\nhand, for the late-type hosts (for which no credible information\non the mass-weighted stellar population age can be extracted), it\nis possible to infer a typical delay relative to the most recent star\nformation episode under the assumption that these progenitors\ntrack star formation activity. I find SSP ages of \u03c4 \u2248 0.03 \u2212 0.5\nGyr, with a median of about 0.25 Gyr, or young+old ages of\nabout 0.01 \u2212 0.4 Gyr with a median of about 0.1 Gyr.\nThus, if short GRBs follow both stellar mass (in early-type\ngalaxies) and star formation activity (in late-type galaxies), the\ntypical delay times are about 3 and 0.2 Gyr, respectively.\n\nprecision, and of those, six are robustly associated with host\ngalaxies (for details see (Fong et al., 2010)). Illustrative examples of HST host images and morphological model fits are\nshown in Figure 13.\n\nFigure 13: Top-left: HST/WFPC2/F814W image of the host galaxy of\nGRB 051221A with a 5\u03c3 error circle representing the afterglow position.

Morphological Analysis\nThe two-dimensional surface brightness profiles were used\nto determine the hosts' effective radii and morphological properties such as the S\u00e9rsic n index. These quantities are crucial\nfor a comparison of the morphologies and sizes to those of long\nGRBs, as well as for normalization of the projected offsets relative to the galaxy size. Three hosts (GRBs 050709, 051221A,\nand 061006) are best modeled with n \u2248 1, corresponding to an\nexponential disk profile, while two hosts (GRBs 050509B and\n050724) are best modeled with n \u2248 3 and \u2248 5.6, respectively,\ntypical of elliptical galaxies. These classifications are in perfect\nagreement with their spectroscopic properties. The final three\nhosts in the sample (GRBs 051210, 060121, and 060313) are\nfaint, and as a results can be modeled with a wide range of n\nvalues, although n \u223c 1 is preferred in all three cases. Therefore,\nof the eight short GRB hosts only two can be robustly classified as elliptical galaxies based on their morphology. A similar\nfraction was determined independently from spectroscopic observations (\u00a73; (Berger, 2009)).\nThe morphological analysis also yields values of the galaxy\neffective radii, re . A range of \u2248 0.2 \u2212 5.8\u2032\u2032 is found, corresponding to physical scales2 of about 1.4 \u2212 21 kpc. The smallest\neffective radius is measured for the host of GRB 060313, while\nthe elliptical host of GRB 050509B has the largest effective radius. The median value for the sample is re \u2248 3.5 kpc. The\neffective radii as a function of n are shown in Figure 15. Also\n\n5. Offsets and the Sub-Galactic Environments\nI next turn from a galactic-scale investigation of short GRB\nhost environments to the sub-galactic scale. In general, the\nsub-galactic environments of cosmic explosions provide powerful insight into the nature of their progenitors. For example, in the case of long GRBs, the distribution of projected\nphysical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers\nmatched the expected distribution for massive stars in an exponential disk (Bloom et al., 2002). Moreover, long GRBs are\nspatially correlated with the brightest UV regions of their hosts\n(Fruchter et al., 2006). Both of these studies have relied on\nhigh angular resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations to spatially resolve the hosts and astrometrically locate\nthe GRB positions to pixel-scale accuracy. As a by-product,\nthese observations also provided detailed morphological information for the hosts (e.g., S\u00e9rsic index, effective radius; e.g.\n(Wainwright et al., 2007)).\nIndividual offsets have been measured for several short\nGRBs (e.g., (Berger et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2005; Bloom et al.,\n2006)), and a study relying on ground based data without a\ncomplete astrometric treatment was published by Troja et al.\n(2008). However, the first systematic study of short GRB offsets, as well as their galactic environments and host morphologies was recently published by Fong et al. (2010). The sample includes ten short GRBs (spanning May 2005 to December\n2006), of which seven have been localized to sub-arcsecond\n\n2 For the faint hosts without a known redshift (GRBs 051210, 060121,\n060313, and possibly 061201) it is assumed that z = 1 (Berger et al., 2007),\nand take advantage of the relative flatness of the angular diameter distance as a\nfunction of redshift beyond z \u223c 0.5.\n\n10\n\n\f21.5\n\n23\n\n22.5\n\n19\n\n20\n\n23\n\n22\n\nSurface Brightness (AB mag / arcsec2)\n\n18\n\n19.5\n\n22\n20\n\n24\n24 050509b\nACS/F814W\n\n26\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n050724\n21\nWFPC2/F450W\n\n24 050709\nACS/F814W\n\n24.5\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n25.5\n\n26\n23\n\n24\n051221\nWFPC2/F555W\n\nWFPC2/F675W\n\n0.1\n24\n24.5\n25\n25.5\n060313\n26 ACS/F775W\n\n1\n\n25\n0.1\n\n1.2\n\n25\n\n22.5\n\n24\n\n22 WFPC2/F814W\n0.1\n1\n\n24.5\n25.5\n\n23\n\n24.5 051210\n\n050724\n\n1\n\n26\n\n23.5 051221\n\n26.5 060121\n\nACS/F606W\n\nWFPC2/F814W\n\n24\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n060313\n\n0.8\n\n26.5 ACS/F475W\n0.1\n\n22.5\n22\n\n23\n23.5\n\n22.5\n\n24\n23\n\n24.5 061006\nWFPC2/F555W\n\n25\n0.1\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n1.4\n\n21.5\n22\n\n23.5\n\n21\n\n25\n\n22\n23\n\n0.1\n\n20\n\n20.5\n\n23.5\n\n050709\n25 WFPC2/F450W\n\nFraction\n\n22\n\nlog re (kpc)\n\n18\n\n061006\nACS/F814W\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n23.5\n1 0.1\n\n\u22120.2\n\nSemi\u2212major Axis (arcsec)\n\nShort GRBs\nLong GRBs\n\n\u22120.4\n\nFigure 14: One-dimensional radial surface brightness profiles for short GRB\nhost galaxies derived using the IRAF task ellipse.

Also shown are the data for long\nGRB hosts based on HST observations from the sample of Wainwright et al.\n(2007). The hosts of short GRBs 050509B and 050724 have n values typical of\nelliptical galaxies, but the remaining hosts have a similar distribution to that of\nlong GRBs (i.e., a median of n \u223c 1, or an exponential disk profile). On the other\nhand, the hosts of short GRBs are larger by about a factor of 2 than the hosts\nof long GRBs, in agreement with their higher luminosities. From Fong et al.\n(2010).\n\nshown are the re and n values for the hosts of long GRBs from\na similar analysis carried out by Wainwright et al. (2007).\nTwo clear trends emerge from the morphological comparison\nof short and long GRB hosts. First, all long GRB hosts have\nn . 2.5, and the median value for the population is hni \u2248 1.1\n(Wainwright et al., 2007). Thus, they are all morphologically\nclassified as exponential disk galaxies, while 2 of the 8 short\nGRB hosts exhibit de Vaucouleurs elliptical galaxy profiles.\nHowever, for the short GRB hosts with n . 2, the distribution of n values appears to be similar to that of long GRB hosts\n(Fong et al., 2010).\nSecond, the short GRB host galaxies have larger effective\nradii, with hre i \u2248 3.5 kpc, compared to hre i \u2248 1.7 kpc for long\nGRB hosts (Wainwright et al., 2007). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(K-S) test indicates that the probability that the short and long\nGRB hosts are drawn from the same underlying distribution\nof host galaxy effective radii is only 0.04. Thus, short GRB\nhost galaxies are systematically larger than long GRB hosts.\nThe larger sizes are expected in the context of the well-known\ngalaxy size-luminosity relation (e.g., (Freeman, 1970)) and the\nhigher luminosity of short GRB hosts (\u00a73; (Berger, 2009)).\nAn additional striking difference between the hosts of long\nand short GRBs is the apparent dearth of interacting or irregular galaxies in the short GRB sample. Of the eight short\nGRB host galaxies with HST observations only one exhibits\nan irregular morphology (GRB 050709) and none appear to be\nundergoing mergers. In contrast, the fraction of long GRB\nhosts with an irregular or merger/interaction morphology is\n\u223c 30\u221260% (Wainwright et al., 2007). The interpretation for the\nhigh merger/interaction fraction in the long GRB sample is that\nsuch galaxies represent sites of intense star formation activity\ntriggered by the merger/interaction process, and are therefore\nsuitable for the production of massive stars (Wainwright et al.,\n2007). The lack of morphological merger signatures in the\nshort GRB sample indicates that if any of the hosts have undergone significant mergers in the past, the delay time between\n\nthe merger and the occurrence of a short GRB is & 1 Gyr (e.g.,\n(Barnes and Hernquist, 1992)).\n5.2. The Offset Distribution\nThe location of each short GRB relative to its host galaxy\ncenter and its overall light distribution was determined through\ndifferential astrometry using optical and near-IR images of\nthe afterglows3 (Fong et al., 2010). With the exception of\nGRB 050709, whose afterglow is directly detected in HST\nobservations, ground-based afterglow images from Magellan,\nGemini, and the VLT were used. The resulting positional uncertainties include contributions from the ground-based to HST\nastrometric tie (\u03c3GB\u2192HST \u2248 10 \u2212 30 mas), the positional uncertainty of the afterglow (\u03c3\u03b8,GRB \u2248 1 \u2212 40 mas for optical afterglows and \u2248 1.7 \u2212 5.8 arcsec for X-ray afterglows), and the\nuncertainty in the centroid of the host galaxy (\u03c3\u03b8,gal \u2248 1 \u2212 20\nmas). The resulting combined offset uncertainties for the short\nGRBs with optical afterglows are . 60 mas, corresponding to\nphysical offset uncertainties of . 0.5 kpc; the best-measured\noffsets have uncertainties at the level of tens of pc. These offsets also correspond to about 1 HST pixel.\nBased on the resulting astrometric ties Fong et al. (2010) find\nthat the projected offsets of short GRBs relative to their host\ncenters range from about 0.12 to 17.7\u2032\u2032. The corresponding\nprojected physical offsets are about 1 \u2212 64 kpc, with a median\n3 Optical\n\n11\n\nafterglows have not been detected for GRBs 050509B and 051210.\n\n\fvalue of about 5 kpc. The largest offsets are measured for GRBs\n050509B and 051210, but those are based on Swift/XRT positions only, with statistical uncertainties of 12 and 18 kpc, respectively. considering only the bursts with sub-arcsecond afterglow positions, the largest offset is 3.7 kpc (GRB 050709),\nand the median offset for the 6 bursts is 2.2 kpc. In the case of\nGRB 061201 the host association remains ambiguous, but even\nfor the nearest detected galaxy the offset is about 14.2 kpc.\n\nwith galaxies (Piranomonte et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2009),\nbut their offsets have not been reported by the authors. Based\non the claimed coincidence a conservative estimate is . 0.5\u2032\u2032 ,\ncorresponding4 to . 4 kpc. For GRB 090426 an offset relative\nto one of the knots in the host galaxy complex was reported\n(Levesque et al., 2010), but not relative to the host center. Finally, four bursts (070809, 080503, 090305, 090515) do not\nhave coincident host galaxies to deep limits; these bursts are\ndiscussed in detail in \u00a76.\nIn addition to the bursts with sub-arcsecond positions, several\nhosts have been identified within XRT error circles in followup observations (GRBs 060801, 061210, 061217, 070429B,\n070729, and 080123; (Berger et al., 2007; Berger, 2009)).\nSince the putative hosts are located within the error circles, the\noffsets are consistent with zero or may be as large as \u223c 30 kpc\n(e.g., (Berger et al., 2007)). For example, the offsets for GRBs\n060801, 061210, and 070429B are 19 \u00b1 16 kpc, 11 \u00b1 10 kpc,\nand 40 \u00b1 48 kpc. I adopt 30 kpc as a typical upper limit on the\noffset for these 6 events. No follow-up observations are available in the literature for most short GRBs with X-ray positions\nfrom 2008-2010. Finally, about 1/4 \u2212 1/3 of all short GRBs\ndiscovered to date have only been detected in \u03b3-rays with positional accuracies of a few arcminutes, thereby precluding a\nunique host galaxy association and an offset measurement.\nThe cumulative distribution of projected physical offsets for\nthe GRBs with HST observations (Fong et al., 2010), supplemented by the bursts with offsets or limits based on optical afterglow positions (070707, 070714B, 070724, 070809, 071227,\n080503, and 090510) is shown in Figure 16. Also shown is the\ndifferential probability distribution, P(\u03b4r)d(\u03b4r), taking into account the non-Gaussian errors on the radial offsets (see discussion in Appendix B of (Bloom et al., 2002)). The median for\nthis sample is about 5 kpc (Fong et al., 2010).\nAs evident from the preceding discussion, this is not a complete offset distribution; roughly an equal number of short\nGRBs have only limits or undetermined offsets due to their detection in just the X-rays or \u03b3-rays5 . Taking these events into\naccount, our most robust inferences about the offset distribution\nof short GRBs are as follows:\n\n1\nShort GRBs\nLong GRBs\n\n0.9\nCumulative Fraction\n\n0.8\nBloom et al. 1999\nFryer et al. 1999\nBelczynski et al. 2006\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n1.2 0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nP(\u03b4r) d(\u03b4r)\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\nOffset (kpc)\n\nFigure 16: Projected physical offsets for short GRBs (black) and long GRBs\n(gray; (Bloom et al., 2002)). The top panel shows a cumulative distribution,\nwhile the bottom panel shows the differential distribution taking into account\nthe non-Gaussian errors on the offsets. The arrows in the bottom panel mark\nthe median value for each distribution. The median value for short GRBs, \u2248\n5 kpc, is about a factor of 5 times larger than for long GRBs. The arrows\nin the top panel mark the most robust constraints on the offset distribution,\ntaking into account the fraction of short GRBs with only \u03b3-ray positions, as well\nas short GRBs for which hosts have been identified within XRT error circles\n(thereby providing a typical range of \u223c 0\u221230 kpc). Also shown in the top panel\nare predicted offset distributions for NS-NS binary mergers in Milky Way type\ngalaxies based on population synthesis models. Good agreement between the\nobserved distribution and models, as well as between the robust constraints and\nmodels is found. From Fong et al. (2010).\n\n\u2022 At least 25% of all short GRBs have projected physical\noffsets of . 10 kpc.\n\u2022 At least 5% of all short GRBs have projected physical offsets of & 20 kpc.\n\nTo investigate the offset distribution in greater detail the\nHST sample was supplemented with offsets for GRBs 070724,\n071227, 080905A, and 090510 from ground-based observations (Berger et al., 2009; Rau et al., 2009; Rowlinson et al.,\n2010). These bursts have accurate positions from optical afterglow detections. In the case of GRBs 070724 and 071227\nthe optical afterglows coincide with the disks of edge-on spiral galaxies (Figure 2; (Berger et al., 2009; D'Avanzo et al.,\n2009)). The offsets of the three bursts are 4.8, 14.8, 18.5, and\n5.5 kpc, respectively.\nThere are 7 additional events with optical afterglow identifications. Of these, two bursts (070707 and 070714B) coincide\n\n\u2022 At least 50% of all short GRBs have projected physical\noffsets of . 30 kpc; this value includes the upper limits\nfor the hosts identified within XRT error circles.\nThese robust constraints are marked in Figure 16.\n4 GRB 070714B is located at z = 0.923, while the redshift of GRB 070707 is\nnot known. Based on the faintness of the host, R \u2248 27.3 mag, we assume z = 1\nto calculate the physical offset.\n5 I do not consider the bursts that lack host searches since there is no a priori\nreason that these events (mainly from 2008-2010) should have a different offset\ndistribution compared to the existing sample.\n\n12\n\n\fI next compare the short GRB offset distribution with the offsets of long GRBs from the sample of Bloom et al. (2002); see\nFigure 16. The offset distribution of long GRBs has been used\nto argue for a massive star progenitor population, and against\nNS-NS binaries (Bloom et al., 2002). The offset distribution of\nshort GRBs is clearly shifted to larger physical scales. In particular, the median offset for the long GRBs is 1.1 kpc, about a\nfactor of 5 times smaller than the median value for short GRBs.\nSimilarly, no long GRB offsets are larger than about 7 kpc,\nwhereas at least some short GRBs appear to have offsets in excess of 15 kpc. The significant difference between the offset\ndistributions indicates that short GRBs do not arise from the\nsame progenitor population as long GRBs.\nI further compare the observed distribution (and the robust constraints outlined above) with predicted distributions\nfor NS-NS binaries in Milky Way type galaxies (Bloom et al.,\n1999; Fryer et al., 1999; Belczynski et al., 2006), appropriate for the observed luminosities of short GRB host galaxies\n(Berger, 2009). There is good agreement between the observed\ndistribution and those predicted by Bloom et al. (1999) and\nBelczynski et al. (2006). The offset distribution of Fryer et al.\n(1999), with a median of about 7 kpc, predicts larger offsets\nand therefore provides a poorer fit to the observed distribution,\nwhich has a median of about 5 kpc. However, all three predicted\ndistributions accommodate the offset constraints. In particular,\nthey predict about 60 \u2212 75% of the offsets to be . 10 kpc, about\n80 \u2212 90% to be . 30 kpc, and about 10 \u2212 25% of the offsets\nto be & 20 kpc. Thus, the projected physical offsets of short\nGRBs are consistent with population synthesis predictions for\nNS-NS binaries. However, the observations are also consistent with partial contribution from other progenitor systems for\nwhich kicks are not expected (magnetars, WD-WD binaries,\naccreting NS).\n\n1\nShort GRBs (optical)\nShort GRBs (UV)\n\n0.9\n\nCumulative fraction\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\nLong GRBs\nC.C.

For each burst the fraction of host light in\npixels fainter than the GRB pixel location is measured. The shaded area is\ndefined by the results for the two available filters for each short GRB. Also\nshown are data for long GRBs (dark gray line) and for core-collapse and Type\nIa SNe (light gray lines) from Fruchter et al. (2006) and Kelly et al. (2008).\nThe dashed line marks the expected distribution for objects which track their\nhost light distribution. Short GRBs appear to under-represent their host light,\nwhile long GRBs tend to be concentrated in the brightest regions of their hosts\n(Fruchter et al., 2006). From Fong et al. (2010).\n\nshort GRB progenitors are likely to be associated with a relatively old stellar population, rather than a young and UV bright\npopulation.\nThe overall distribution has a median value of \u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.4\n(blue vs. red filters); namely, only in about one-quarter of the\ncases, 50% of the host light is in pixels fainter than at the GRB\nlocation. Thus, the overall distribution of short GRB locations\nunder-represents the host galaxies light distribution, but traces\nthe red light (old stars) more closely than the blue light (star\nformation). This is also true in comparison to the distribution\nfor core-collapse SNe, which appear to track their host light\n(Fruchter et al., 2006), and even Type Ia SNe, which have a median of about 0.4 (Kelly et al., 2008). Thus, the progenitors of\nshort GRBs appear to be more diffusely distributed than Type\nIa SN progenitors.\n\n5.3. Light Distribution Analysis\nIn addition to the offset analysis in the previous section,\nFong et al. (2010) studied the local environments of short GRBs\nusing a comparison of the host brightness at the GRB location\nto the overall host light distribution. This approach is advantageous because it is independent of galaxy morphology, and\ndoes not suffer from ambiguity in the definition of the host center (see (Fruchter et al., 2006)). I note that for the regular morphologies of most short GRB hosts (\u00a75.1), the definition of the\nhost center is generally robust, unlike in the case of long GRBs\n(Fruchter et al., 2006; Wainwright et al., 2007). On the other\nhand, this approach has the downside that it requires precise\npixel-scale positional accuracy. In the existing sample, this is\nonly available for 6 short bursts.\nThe fraction of total host light in pixels fainter than the afterglow pixel brightness for each host/filter combination is given\nin Fong et al. (2010). The cumulative light distribution histogram is shown in Figure 17. The shaded histogram represents\nthe range defined by the dual filters for 5 of the 6 bursts. The\nupper bound of the distribution is defined by the blue filters,\nindicating that short GRBs trace the rest-frame optical light of\ntheir hosts better than the rest-frame UV. This indicates that\n\nAn extensive analysis of the brightness distribution at the\nlocation of long GRBs has been carried out by Fruchter et al.\n(2006). These authors find that long GRBs are more concentrated on the brightest regions of their hosts than expected from\nthe light distribution of each host. In particular, they conclude that the probability distribution of long GRB positions is\nroughly proportional to the surface brightness squared. As can\nbe seen from Figure 17, short GRBs have a significantly more\ndiffuse distribution relative to the host light than long GRBs. In\nparticular, for the latter, the median light fraction is about 0.85\ncompared to about 0.25 \u00b1 0.15 for the short GRBs.\n13\n\n\fFigure 18: Images of the fields around the optical afterglow positions of short GRBs 061201, 070809, 080503, 090305A, and 090515 (top-left to bottom-right).\nThese are the 5 bursts in the current sample that have optical afterglow positions and no coincident hosts to limits of & 25.5 mag. From Berger (2010).\n\nspatially coincide with bright galaxy counterparts to assess the\npotential for a host with large offset. This is a particularly important test if combined with the afterglow properties of short\nGRBs with and without coincident hosts. In the current sample,\nthere are 5 cases of short GRBs with sub-arcsecond positions\nand no obvious bright hosts6 . Below, I assess the possibility of\nlarge offsets for these bursts, and compare this with alternative\nexplanations (e.g., a high redshift origin). The sample includes\n20 short GRBs with optical afterglows. Images of the fields\naround the 5 bursts with no coincident hosts are shown in Figure 18; hereafter, I denote these 5 bursts as Sample 2, with the\nremaining 15 bursts with coincident hosts designated as Sample 1. The afterglow positions, as well as nearby galaxies with\nvarying probabilities of chance coincidence are marked in Figure 18. The limits at the positions of the afterglows range from\n& 25.5 to & 26.5 mag (Berger, 2010).\nIn terms of the afterglow properties, the bursts in Sample 2\nhave a median optical brightness that is 1.4 mag fainter than the\nbursts in Sample 1 (Figure 19, and X-ray fluxes at 8 hours that\nare about a factor of 2 times smaller. Their \u03b3-ray fluences are\nsimilarly smaller, by about a factor of 5 (Berger, 2010). The\ndifferences in optical afterglow brightness can be due to lower\n\n6. Is There Evidence for Large Progenitor Kicks?\nOne of the predictions of the compact object coalescence\nmodel is that some binaries could merge at large separations\nfrom their host galaxies due to a combination of large kick\nvelocities and a long merger timescale (Bloom et al., 1999;\nFryer et al., 1999; Belczynski et al., 2006). With kicks of several hundred km s\u22121 and merger timescales of \u223c Gyr, such a\nbinary could travel several hundred kpc from its host, corresponding to \u223c 1\u2032 at z \u223c 1 and \u223c 10\u2032 at z \u223c 0.1. Such large\noffsets would not be expected in other progenitor scenarios. It\nis important to note, however, that if the typical kick velocities\nare . 102 km s\u22121 , an NS-NS/NS-BH system is likely to remain bound to its host regardless of the merger timescale, and\nhence to reside at offsets of . tens of kpc (as already inferred\nfor some short GRBs (Fong et al., 2010); Figure 16). Similarly,\nshort merger timescales (tens to hundreds of Myr) would also\nlead to relatively small offsets regardlss of the kick velocity.\nClearly, an observational demonstration of a large offset is\nnot trivial. Ideally, we would like to measure the redshift of\nthe burst directly through afterglow spectroscopy and then associate it with a galaxy at a large separation. However, to date,\nshort GRB redshifts have been measured through their host associations so this test is not possible.\nAt a more tentative level, we can also investigate the largescale environments around short GRBs that do not appear to\n\n6 I do not discuss cases with only XRT positions of a few arcsec radius since\nthose do not generally lead to significant offsets and furthermore nearly always\ncontain at least one possible host consistent with zero offset.\n\n14\n\n\f\u22121\n\n050709\n\nProbability, P(<\u03b4R)\n\n051210\n\n\u22122\n\n070714b\n\n070809\n060801\n\n100206\n060502b\n\n070429b\n091109b\n\n0\n\n080905\n\n071227\n080426\n090510\n070707\n050813\n061006\n\n10\n\n080503\n\n26\n\n050724\n\n060121\n061201\n\n060313\n051221\n\n061210\n070724\n081226\n\n090515\n\n25\n\n050509b\n\n23\n24\n\n\u22121\n\nt\n\n061217\n\n22\n\n090305\n\nOptical AB Magnitude\n\nSample 3\n\n100117\n\nSample 2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121/2\n\nt\n\n090426\n\nSample 1\n\n21\n\n1\n\n10\n10\nTime after the burst (hrs)\n\n090305\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n090515\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n\u03b4R = Distance from GRB (arcsec)\n\nFigure 20: Probability of chance coincidence as a function of distance from\na short GRB optical afterglow position for galaxies near the location of each\nburst. These are the galaxies marked in Figure 18. In each panel I mark the\ngalaxy with the lowest probability of chance detection with a circle. In 4 of\nthe 5 cases, the lowest probability is associated with galaxies that are offset by\n\u223c 5 \u2212 15\u2032\u2032 . Moreover, even the nearest galaxies are offset by \u2248 1.6 \u2212 5.8\u2032\u2032 . From\nBerger (2010).\n\nI find that for 4 of the 5 bursts, faint galaxies (\u223c 25 \u2212 26\nmag) can be identified within \u2248 1.6 \u2212 2\u2032\u2032 of the afterglow\npositions, with associated chance coincidence probabilities of\n\u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2; in the case of GRB 090515 I do not detect any\nsuch faint galaxies within \u2248 5\u2032\u2032 of the afterglow position. For\nGRB 080503 I also include the galaxy at an offset of 0.8\u2032\u2032 and\nmAB (F606W) = 27.3\u00b10.2 mag identified by Perley et al. (2009)\nbased on their deeper stack of HST observations. On the other\nhand, for 4 of the 5 bursts I find that the galaxies with the lowest\nprobability of chance coincidence, \u2248 0.03 \u2212 0.15, are brighter\nobjects with offsets of about 6 \u2212 16\u2032\u2032 from the burst positions;\nonly in the case of GRB 080503 the lowest chance coincidence\nis associated with the nearest galaxy (see (Perley et al., 2009)).\nThe use of a posteriori probabilities to assign unique galaxy\nassociations is fraught with difficulties. First, for a given apparent brightness, galaxies located further away from the GRB\nposition, potentially due to larger kicks and/or longer merger\ntimescales in the NS-NS merger framework, have higher probabilities of chance coincidence. Since no a priori modelindependent knowledge is available for the range of possible\nkicks and merger timescales, it is not possible to rule out galaxies at very large offsets for which P(< \u03b4R) \u223c 1. Indeed, a\nreasonable constraint of vkick . 103 km s\u22121 and \u03c4merger . 10\nGyr leads to only a weak constraint on the offset of . 10 Mpc.\nAt z = 0.1 (z = 1) this corresponds to about 1.5\u25e6 (0.3\u25e6 ), a pro-\n\n1\n\u00d7 100.33(m\u221224)\u22122.44 arcsec\u22122 , (3)\n0.33 \u00d7 ln(10)\n\nand the chance coincidence probability for a given separation,\nP(< \u03b4R), is then:\n2\n\n080503\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\ndensities or higher redshifts for Sample 2. Both of these scenarios would also explain the lack of bright coincident hosts, since\nlow densities may be indicative of large offsets and high redshifts will lead to fainter host galaxies. The difference in X-ray\nbrightness does not significantly constrain these two possibilities, while the fainter \u03b3-ray emission of the bursts in Sample\n2 points to high redshift as the likely explanation, since in the\ncontext of the standard GRB model the prompt emission fluence does not depend on the circumburst density.\nI next turn to an analysis of the large-scale environments of\nthe bursts in Sample 2, particularly in comparison to the hosts\nof bursts in Sample 1. None of the 5 bursts have coincident\nhosts to significantly deeper limits than the hosts in Sample 1.\nI therefore investigate the possibility of large offsets through\nthe calculation of chance coincidence probabilities for nearby\ngalaxies, as well as the possibility of a high redshift origin. The\nchance coincidence probability for nearby galaxies depends on\nboth their apparent magnitude and their distance from the optical afterglow position. The expected number density of galaxies brighter than a measured magnitude, m, is (Hogg et al., ????;\nBloom et al., 2002; Beckwith et al., 2006):\n\nP(< \u03b4R) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c0(\u03b4R) \u03c3(\u2264m) ,\n\n070809\n\n10\n0\n10\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nNumber\n\nFigure 19: Optical afterglow brightness on timescales of a few hours after the\nburst for short GRBs with detected afterglows (Sample 1: black squares; Sample 2: red squares) or upper limits (gray triangles). The lines at the top right\nindicate the fading tracks for afterglow decay rates of \u03b1 = \u22120.5 and \u22121. The\nright panel shows the projected histogram for the bursts with detected afterglows (hatched) and upper limits (open). The symbols mark the mean for each\nsample, and the vertical bar marks the standard deviation for Sample 1. From\nBerger (2010).\n\n\u03c3(\u2264 m) =\n\n061201\n\n10\n0\n10\n\n(4)\n\nwhere for offsets substantially larger than the galaxy size, \u03b4R is\nthe appropriate radius in Equation 4 (Bloom et al., 2002).\nThe resulting distributions for each field are shown in Figure 20; I include all galaxies that have probabilities of . 0.95.\n15\n\n\fjected distance at which nearly all galaxies will have a chance\ncoincidence probability of order unity. However, this fact only\nmeans that we cannot rule out offsets that are even larger than\ninferred from the most likely host association.\nA second difficulty is that I am using angular offsets, which\nignore the potential wide range of redshifts (and by extension\nalso luminosities) of the various galaxies. For example, if the\nfaint galaxies with small offsets are located at z & 1, the corresponding physical offsets are \u223c 15 kpc, while if the galaxies\nat \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 offsets are located at z \u223c 0.3, the offsets are only\nsomewhat larger, \u223c 30 kpc. A galaxy at an even lower redshift, z \u223c 0.1, with an offset of 50 kpc will be located about\n30\u2032\u2032 from the GRB position and incur a large penalty in terms\nof chance coincidence probability. It is important to note, however, that galaxies at lower redshift will generally have brighter\napparent magnitudes, partially compensating for the larger angular separations (Equations 3 and 4). In only a single case\n(GRB 070809) I find a galaxy with P(< \u03b4R) . 0.1 at \u03b4R & 1\u2032\n(which at z = 0.043 for this galaxy corresponds to a physical\noffset of about 100 kpc).\nA final complication, which is not unique to this subset of\nevents, is that only projected offsets can be measured, \u03b4R =\n\u03b4R3D \u00d7 cos(\u03b8). The measured offsets can be used as lower limits\non the actual offsets, while for the overall distribution it is possible to apply an average correction factor of \u03c0/2, based on the\nexpectation value for the projection factor, cos(\u03b8).\nDespite these caveats, it is possible to address the probability\nthat all of the associations are spurious. This joint probability is\nsimply the product of the individual probabilities (Bloom et al.,\n2002). For the faint galaxies at small angular separations the\nprobability that all are spurious is Pall \u2248 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 , while for\nthe galaxies with the lowest probability of chance coincidence\nthe joint probability is nearly 30 times lower, Pall \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nConversely, the probabilities that none of the associations are\nspurious are \u2248 0.42 and \u2248 0.59, respectively. These values indicate the some spurious coincidences may be present in Sample\n2. Indeed, the probabilities that 1, 2, or 3 associations are spurious are [0.40, 0.15, 0.027] and [0.34, 0.068, 0.006], respectively. These results indicate that for the faint galaxies it is not\nunlikely that 2 \u2212 3 associations (out of 5) are spurious, while for\nthe brighter galaxies 1 \u2212 2 associations may be spurious. This\nanalysis clearly demonstrates why a joint statistical study is superior to case-by-case attempts to associate short GRBs with\ngalaxies at substantial offsets.\nBased on the possibility of association with the galaxies at\nseparations of \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 , I obtained redshift for three of these\ngalaxies (Berger, 2010), leading to a star forming galaxy\nat z = 0.111 (GRB 061201), an early-type galaxy at z =\n0.473 (GRB 070809), and an early-type galaxy at z = 0.403\n(GRB 090515). The fainter host at separations of a few arcsec\nlikely reside at z & 1. The redshifts provide an indication of the\nphysical projected offsets (\u00a76.2).\n\nGRB 061201 was detected in the ultraviolet by the Swift/UVOT\nand it is therefore located at z . 1.7 (Roming et al., 2006). The\nremaining four bursts were detected in the optical g- or r-band,\nand can therefore be placed at z . 3 or . 4.3; see Berger (2010)\nfor details.\n\nNumber\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n0\n18\n\nSample 1\nSample 2 (limits)\n\nHost R\u2212band Magnitude\n\n19\n\nSample 2 (offsets)\n\n20\n\nLong GRBs\n\n21\n\n0.1\u22121 \u00d7 L*\n\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nRedshift\nFigure 21: Main Panel: Host galaxy optical magnitude as a function of redshift\nfor short GRB hosts (black squares), long GRB hosts (detections: gray circles;\nnon-detections or no redshifts: gray triangles), and galaxies with a luminosity\nof 0.1\u22121 L\u2217 (shaded region). The dashed lines mark the upper limits at the GRB\npositions for the short GRBs with no coincident hosts. The arrows mark the upper limits on the redshifts of three bursts in Sample 1 with faint hosts, based on\nthe detection of the afterglows in the optical band (i.e., lack of a strong Lyman\nbreak). If underlying host galaxies exist for Sample 2, their non-detection indicates z & 1.5 (for 0.1 L\u2217 ) or & 3 (for L\u2217 ). The alternative possibility that they\nare located at similar redshifts to the detected hosts, requires . 0.01 L\u2217 , but\nthis does not naturally explain their fainter afterglows. Upper Panel: Projected\nredshift histogram for Sample 1 (black) and Sample 2 (dashed red limits) under the assumption that the hosts are 0.1 L\u2217 galaxies (z \u223c 1.5) and L\u2217 galaxies\n(z \u223c 3). From Berger (2010).\n\nIt is possible to place additional constraints on the redshifts of\nany underlying hosts using the existing sample short GRB host\ngalaxies. In Figure 21 I plot the r-band magnitudes as a function of redshift for all available short GRB hosts from Sample\n1. For the faint hosts without known redshifts (GRBs 060121,\n060313, and 070707), I place upper limits on the redshift using optical detections of the afterglows. A wide range of host\nmagnitudes, rAB \u223c 16.5 \u2212 27.5 mag, is apparent. I also plot the\nr-band magnitudes of long GRB hosts (Savaglio et al., 2009),\nas well as the r \u2212 z phase space that is traced by galaxies with\nluminosities of L = 0.1 \u2212 1 L\u2217 . I find excellent correspondence\nbetween the hosts of long and short GRBs, and the phase-space\ntraced by 0.1 \u2212 1 L\u2217 galaxies, at least to z \u223c 4. In the context\nof these distributions, the available limits for the short GRBs\nin Sample 2 translate to redshifts of z & 1.5 if they are 0.1 L\u2217\ngalaxies, or z & 3 if they are L\u2217 galaxies. The latter lower\nlimits are comparable to the redshift upper limits inferred from\n\n6.1. Undetected Faint Hosts at High Redshift?\nThe redshifts of the GRBs in Sample 2 can be constrained\nbased on their detections in the optical band (i.e., the lack\nof strong suppression by the Ly\u03b1 forest). The afterglow of\n16\n\n\fthe afterglow detections. I note that for GRB 080503, the limits of & 28.5 mag and z . 3 from the afterglow (Perley et al.,\n2009) place even more stringent limits on the luminosity of an\nunderlying galaxy of . 0.1 L\u2217 galaxy.\nThe possibility that the five bursts originated at z & 3 leads\nto a bimodal redshift distribution (Figure 21). Nearly all of the\nbursts in Sample 1 with a known redshift (9/10) have z \u2248 0.2\u22121,\nwith a median of hzi \u2248 0.5; the sole exception is GRB 090426\nat z = 2.61 (Antonelli et al., 2009; Levesque et al., 2010). The\nthree bursts with faint coincident hosts have upper limits of z .\n4 from afterglow detections, while lower limit of z & 1.5\u22122 can\nbe placed on these hosts if they have L & 0.1 L\u2217 . Adding the\nSample 2 bursts with the assumption that they have z & 3 will\nfurthermore result in a population of short GRBs with a median\nof z \u223c 3, and leave a substantial gap at z \u223c 1 \u2212 2 (Figure 21). If\nthe 5 bursts are instead hosted by 0.1 L\u2217 galaxies, the inferred\nlower limits on the redshifts (z & 1.5) lead to a potentially more\nuniform redshift distribution.\nIt is difficult to explain a bimodal redshift distribution with\na single progenitor population such as NS-NS binaries, without appealing to, for example, a bimodal distribution of merger\ntimescales. Another possibility is two distinct progenitor populations, producing bursts of similar observed properties but with\ndistinct redshift ranges. While these possibilities are difficult to\nexclude, they do not provide a natural explanation for the short\nGRB population.\nA final alternative explanation is that any underlying hosts\nreside at similar redshifts to the known hosts in Sample 1\n(z \u223c 0.5), but have significantly lower luminosities of . 0.01\nL\u2217 . This scenario would not naturally explain why the bursts in\nSample 2 have fainter optical and X-ray afterglows, as well as\nlower \u03b3-ray fluences. I therefore do not consider this possibility\nto be the likely explanation.\n\n4\n3.5\n\nSample 1\nSample 2 (z \u223c 0.3)\nSample 2 (z \u223c 1)\n\n3\n\nNumber\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n1\nlog [\u03b4R] (kpc)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nSample 1\nSample 2 (z \u223c 0.3)\nSample 2 (z \u223c 1)\n\nNumber\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6.2. Large Offsets?\nWhile higher redshifts may explain the lack of detected hosts,\nthe fainter afterglows, and the smaller \u03b3-ray fluences of the\nbursts in Sample 2, this scenario suffers from several difficulties\noutlined above. The alternative explanation is that the bursts occurred at significant offsets relative to their hosts, and hence in\nlower density environments that would explain the faint afterglow emission (though possibly not the lower \u03b3-ray fluences).\nAs demonstrated in the chance coincidence analysis, the offsets may be \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 15 kpc) if the bursts originated in the faint\ngalaxies at the smallest angular separations, or \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 30\u221275\nkpc) if they originated in the brighter galaxies with the lowest\nprobability of chance coincidence (Figure 20).\nThe projected physical offsets for Sample 1 and Sample 2\nare shown in Figure 22. The mean and standard deviation for\nSample 1 are \u03b4R = 4.2 \u00b1 3.8 kpc, and a log-normal fit results\nin a mean of log(\u03b4R) \u2248 0.5 and a width of \u03c3log(\u03b4R) \u2248 0.3. On\nthe other hand, the bursts in Sample 2 have a mean offset of\nabout 19 kpc if they arise in the faint galaxies with small angular\nseparation, or about 40 kpc if they arise in the brighter galaxies,\npointing to distinct distributions.\nA similar result is obtained when considering the offset normalized by each host's effective radius, Re (as advocated by\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\nlog [\u03b4R / Re]\n\n1\n\nFigure 22: Top: Histogram of projected physical offsets relative to the host\ngalaxy center for short GRBs with coincident hosts (hatched black), and bursts\nwith no coincident hosts if the galaxies with lowest chance coincidence probability are the hosts (hatched red), or if the faint galaxies with smallest angular\nseparation are hosts (open red); see Figure 20. The dashed line is a log-normal\nfit to the bursts with coincident hosts. Bottom: Same, but for offsets normalized\nrelative to the host effective radii, Re . The dashed line is a log-normal fit to the\nbursts with coincident hosts. From Berger (2010).\n\nFong et al. (2010)). This quantity takes into account the varying sizes of the hosts due to both intrinsic size variations and\nredshift effects. It also gives a better indication of whether the\nburst coincides with the host light or is significantly offset. As\nshown in Figure 22, the host-normalized offsets of Sample 1\nhave a mean and standard deviation of about 1 \u00b1 0.6 Re , and a\nrange of about 0.2 \u2212 2 Re . A log-normal fit results in a mean of\nlog(\u03b4R/Re) \u2248 0 and a width of \u03c3log(\u03b4R/Re ) \u2248 0.2. The bursts\nin Sample 2 have much larger host-normalized offsets, with\n(\u03b4R/Re) = 7.3 \u00b1 2.3 if they originated in the galaxies with the\nlowest chance coincidence probability. Even if I associate the\nbursts with the nearest faint hosts, the distribution has a mean\nof about 4 Re , reflecting the fact that the effective radii of the\nfaint galaxies are smaller than those of the brighter ones.\n17\n\n\f7.1.

Only if all the unidentified hosts are early-type galaxies,\nwould we have a ratio of 1:1. The putative hosts identified in coincidence with XRT error circles exhibit a similar ratio of about\n4:1. This result is also supported by the morphological analysis of short GRB hosts observed with HST (Fong et al., 2010),\nwhich indicates that the ratio of hosts with an exponential disk\nprofile versus a de Vaucouleurs profile is 4:1. Thus, I conclude\nthat the most conservative estimate of the ratio of star forming\nto elliptical hosts is about 1:1, but that if the well-studied (i.e.,\nbrighter) hosts are representative of the whole sample, than the\nratio is about 4:1. A ratio of about 1:1 is expected if short GRBs\nselect galaxies by stellar mass alone. Thus, the existing demographics cannot rule out this scenario, but do appear to point to\nan over-abundance of short GRBs in late-type galaxies, possibly indicative of a short GRB rate that partially depends on star\nformation activity.\nAlthough star forming hosts appear to dominate the host\npopulation, it is clear from a comparison of their luminosities,\nmetallicities, stellar masses, population ages, sizes, and star formation rates that they are distinct from the hosts of long GRBs.\nNamely, they exhibit lower star formation activity and appear\nto be larger, more massive, and dominated by more evolved\nstellar populations. This indicates that the short GRB progenitors are mostly related to the old stellar populations within their\nhosts, and perhaps only partially to the modest level of on-going\nstar formation activity. This is further supported by the dearth\nof morphological galaxy merger signatures, which point to delays of & 1 Gyr relative to any merger-triggered star formation\nepisodes. These conclusions are in direct contrast to the massive star progenitors of long GRBs, which select galaxies by\nstar formation (and perhaps metallicity). While the relation to\nold stellar populations does not rule out models such as WDWD mergers or WD/NS AIC, it does disfavor young magnetars.\nAs an aside, I note that this result demonstrates that caution\nshould be taken with the proposed re-classification of short and\nlong GRBs into Type I and II events, marking old and young\nprogenitors, respectively (Zhang et al., 2007, 2009). Such a\nnew bimodal classification may lead to the erroneous conclusion that short GRBs in late-type galaxies (even if they track\nthe on-going star formation activity) share the same progenitors as long GRBs (e.g., (Virgili et al., 2009)) since both would\nbe classified as Type II. At the very least, such a new classification scheme may require a further breakdown of the Type\nII events into those that result from massive stars versus those\nthat simply track star formation activity with a modest delay,\ne.g., Type IIa and IIb. Clearly, this is beyond the scope of the\ncurrent short GRB sample.\nIn the context of the NS-NS/NS-BH merger models, the\nhost demographics, coupled with the redshift distribution,\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nNS\u2212NS: Bloom et al. 1999\nNS\u2212NS: Fryer et al. 1999\nNS\u2212NS: Belczynski et al. 2006\nGCs: Salvaterra et al. 2010\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\u03b4R (kpc)\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFigure 23: Cumulative distributions of projected physical offsets for short\nGRBs with coincident hosts (black line), and combined with offsets for the\nhosts with the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence (thick red line) or the\nfaint hosts with smallest angular offsets (thin red line). Also shown are predicted distributions for NS-NS kicks from several models (Bloom et al., 1999;\nFryer et al., 1999; Belczynski et al., 2006), and for dynamically-formed NS-NS\nbinaries from globular clusters (shaded region marks a range of predictions for\nhost galaxy masses of 5\u00d71010 \u22121012 M\u2299 ; (Salvaterra et al., 2010)). The models\nwith kick velocities are in good agreement with the measured offset distribution\nfor either set of galaxy associations, while the globular clusters model provides\na poor match to the data. From Berger (2010).\n\nThus, the distributions of physical, host-normalized, and angular offsets exhibit a clear bimodality when associating the\nbursts in Sample 2 with the galaxies at z \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.5. The\neffect is still apparent, though less pronounced in the case of\nassociation with the faint galaxies at z & 1. Thus, if the offset\nscenario is correct, the resulting distributions point to a possible bimodality rather than a single continuous distribution of\noffsets.\nThe cumulative distributions of physical offsets for Sample 1\nalone, and in conjunction with the two possible offset groups for\nSample 2 are shown in Figure 23. The combined distributions\nhave a median of about 4 kpc, driven by the bursts with coincident hosts. However, there is a clear extension to larger physical\noffsets in the case of association with the brighter galaxies, with\nabout 20% of all objects having \u03b4R & 30 kpc. The cumulative\ndistributions are particularly useful for comparison with NS-NS\nmerger models since predictions exist for both the kick scenario\nand the globular cluster origin model.\n\n7. Implications for the Progenitors\nThe extensive analysis of host galaxy properties and the subgalactic environments of short GRBs presented above provides\nimportant insight into the nature of the progenitors. I address in\nparticular the popular NS-NS merger model, as well as delayed\nmagnetar formation via WD-WD mergers or WD accretioninduced collapse (Metzger et al., 2008).\n18\n\n\fprovide a rough constraint on the typical merger time delay (Guetta and Piran, 2006; Nakar et al., 2006; Berger et al.,\n2007; Zheng and Ramirez-Ruiz, 2007). In the formulation of\nZheng and Ramirez-Ruiz (2007), with a merger timescale probability distribution of P(\u03c4) \u221d \u03c4n , the dominance of star forming\nhosts with a ratio of about 4:1 indicates n . \u22121. I note that\nthis is only a rough estimate since the calculation is appropriate for z \u223c 0, while the host redshift distribution extends at\nleast to z \u223c 1. Similarly, a comparison of the observed redshift distribution (with a range of z \u223c 0.2 \u2212 2 and a median\nof \u223c 0.7) to the models of Nakar et al. (2006) (their Figure 2),\nindicates a typical progenitor merger timescale of about 3 Gyr\n(for a log-normal merger timescale distribution). A comparison to the models of Guetta and Piran (2006) (their Figure 4),\nindicates a value of n \u223c \u22121 (for a power law merger timescale\ndistribution), in good agreement with the results from host demographics.\nThus, I conclude that based on the nature of short GRB host\ngalaxies and their redshift distribution, the merger timescale\ndistribution for the NS-NS/NS-BH coalescence models can be\ncharacterized by a power law index of \u223c \u22121 (power law model)\nor a typical value of \u223c 3 Gyr (log-normal model). If the subset\nof short GRBs in late-type galaxies tend to track star formation activity, their typical progenitor ages are instead \u223c 0.2 Gyr\n(Leibler and Berger, 2010). It should be noted that the merger\ntimescale distribution for the admittedly small sample of Galactic NS-NS binaries has been claimed to be \u223c \u22121 (Piran, 1992;\nChampion et al., 2004).\n\nyoung magnetar flares, cannot be ruled out. The existence of\nmodest (\u223c 10 kpc) and perhaps large (\u223c 50 kpc) offsets in the\nsample suggests that these latter models are not likely to account for all short GRBs.\nIn the context of implications for the progenitor population,\nthe study of short GRB physical offsets by Troja et al. (2008)\nled to the claim that short GRBs with extended X-ray emission have systematically smaller offsets than those with only\na prompt spike, possibly due to a systematic difference in the\nprogenitors. The HST sample of Fong et al. (2010) includes\nthree short GRBs with significant extended emission (050709,\n050724, and 061006), and one burst (060121) with possible\nextended emission (4.5\u03c3 significance; (Donaghy et al., 2006)).\nThe physical offsets of these bursts are about 3.7, 2.7, 1.3, and 1\nkpc, respectively, leading to a mean offset of about 2.2 kpc. The\nphysical offsets of the bursts without extended emission, but\nwith precise afterglow positions (051221, 060313, and 061201)\nare 2.0, 2.3, and 14.2 or 32.5 kpc, respectively. The two events\nwith no extended emission and with XRT positions (050509B\nand 051210) have offsets of about 54 \u00b1 12 and 28 \u00b1 23 kpc,\nrespectively. Including the ground-based sample with optical\nafterglow positions, the bursts with apparent extended emission (070714B, 071227, 080513, and 090510; (Barbier et al.,\n2007; Sakamoto et al., 2007; Ukwatta et al., 2009; Perley et al.,\n2009)) have offsets of . 4, 14.8, \u223c 20, and \u223c 5.5 kpc, while the\nbursts without extended emission (070724 and 070809) have\noffsets of 4.8 and \u223c 6.5 kpc. Thus, in the sample of events\nwith sub-arcsecond positions, 6/8 bursts with extended emission have offsets of . 5 kpc and 2/8 have likely offsets of\n\u223c 15 \u2212 20 kpc. In the sample without extended emission, 4/5\nhave offsets of . 6 kpc and 1/5 has a likely offset of \u223c 14 \u2212 32\nkpc. Thus, at the present it does not appear that there is a significant difference in the two offset distributions.\nThe inclusion of events with only XRT positions does not alter this conclusion. In particular, of the subset with no extended\nemission only GRB 050509B is likely to have a significant offset, while GRBs 051210, 060801, and 070429B have offsets\n(28 \u00b1 23, 19 \u00b1 16, and 40 \u00b1 48 kpc, respectively) that are consistent with zero. Similarly, GRB 061210 with extended emission has an offset of 11 \u00b1 10 kpc. A continued investigation of\nthe difference between short GRBs with and without extended\nemission will greatly benefit from the use of host-normalized\noffsets, which take into account the individual hosts' effective\nradii.\n\n7.2. Short GRB Offsets\nThe differential offsets measured from the HST observations\nprovide the most precise values to date for short GRBs, with a\ntotal uncertainty of only \u223c 10 \u221260 mas (. 1 pixel), corresponding to \u223c 30 \u2212 500 pc. None of the offsets are smaller than \u223c 1\nkpc, while this is the median offset for long GRBs. On the other\nhand, a substantial fraction of the offsets are only a few kpc, indicating that at least some short GRBs explode within the stellar component of their hosts (rather than their extended halos).\nThe median offset from the HST observations supplemented by\nground-based data is about 5 kpc (Figure 16), roughly 5 times\nlarger than for long GRBs.\nAs discussed above, the observed offset distribution is incomplete since about 1/4 \u2212 1/3 of all short GRBs have only\n\u03b3-ray positions (\u223c 1 \u2212 3\u2032 ), and a similar fraction have only XRT\npositions, which generally lead to a range of \u223c 0 \u2212 30 kpc.\nTaking these limitations into account I find that the most robust\nconstraints on the offset distribution are that & 25% of all short\nGRBs have offsets of . 10 kpc, and that & 5% have offsets\nof & 20 kpc. In addition, for the current sample of of short\nGRBs with sub-arcsecond afterglow positions and no coincident bright hosts, I find evidence for offsets of \u223c 50 kpc (\u00a76).\nBoth the observed offset distribution and the various constraints are in good agreement with predictions for the offset distribution of NS-NS binaries in Milky Way type galaxies\n(Bloom et al., 1999; Fryer et al., 1999; Belczynski et al., 2006).\nHowever, at the present a partial contribution from other progenitor systems, such as delayed magnetar formation and even\n\n7.3. Large Offsets?\nThe sample of short GRBs with optical afterglows represents\nabout 1/3 of all short bursts, and may thus not be fully representative. One often-discussed bias is that the bursts with optical afterglows require a high circumburst density, and therefore have negligible offsets. However, from the analysis in \u00a76\n(Berger, 2010) it is clear that one explanation for the lack of coincident hosts for the bursts in Sample 2 is indeed large offsets,\ndespite their detection in the optical band.\nAs shown in Figure 23, the NS-NS merger model predictions\nhave a median of about 6 kpc, compared to about 4 kpc for\nthe observed sample. On the other hand, the models predict\n19\n\n\f10 \u2212 20% of offsets to be & 30 kpc, in good agreement with\nthe observed distribution in both the \u223c 15 kpc and \u223c 40 kpc\nscenarios (\u00a76). I note that the overall smaller offsets measured\nfrom the data may be due to projections effects. Indeed, the\nmean correction factor of \u03c0/2 nicely reconciles the theoretical\nand observed distributions.\nIn \u00a76 I noted a bimodality in the physical and hostnormalized offsets for Sample 1 and Sample 2 (Figure 22). In\nthe framework of NS-NS binary kicks this bimodality may indicate that the binaries generally remain bound to their host galaxies, thereby spending most of their time at the maximal distance\ndefined by dmax = 2GMhost /v2kick (i.e., with their kinetic energy\nstored as potential energy; (Bloom et al., 2007)). This would\nrequire typical kick velocities of less than a few hundred km\ns\u22121 .\nI further compare the observed offset distribution to predictions for dynamically formed NS-NS binaries in globular clusters, with a range of host galaxy virial masses of 5 \u00d7 1010 \u2212 1012\nM\u2299 (Salvaterra et al., 2010). These models predict a range of\nonly \u2248 5 \u2212 40% of all NS-NS mergers to occur within 10 kpc\nof the host center, in contrast to the observed distribution with\nabout 70% with \u03b4R . 10 kpc. I stress that this result is independent of what offsets are assigned to the bursts in Sample 2 since\nthey account for only 1/4 of the bursts with optical afterglows.\nOn the other hand, the globular cluster origin may account for\nthe bimodality in the physical and host-normalized offsets (Figure 22), with the objects in Sample 2 arising in globular clusters\nand the objects with coincident hosts arising from primordial\nNS-NS binaries. This possibility also agrees with the predicted\nfraction of dynamically-formed NS-NS binaries of \u223c 10 \u2212 30%\n(Grindlay et al., 2006). The cumulative offset distributions for\nSample 2 alone (assuming the hosts are the galaxies with the\nlowest probability of chance coincidence) is well-matched by\nthe range of predictions for dynamically-formed NS-NS binaries in globular clusters (Figure 23). In this scenario, however,\nthe implication is that short GRBs outside of globular clusters\ndo not experience kicks as expected for NS-NS binaries since\nthe largest measured offset is only 15 kpc.\nUnless the populations of short GRBs with only X-ray or \u03b3ray positions have fundamentally different offset distributions,\nI conclude that the measured offsets of short GRBs and the predicted offsets for NS-NS kicks are in good agreement, if when\ntreating all short GRBs with optical afterglows as a single population. Alternatively, it is possible that the bimodal distributions of physical and host-normalized offsets point to a progenitor bimodality, with the bursts in Sample 2 originating in globular clusters.\n\nhosts' rest-frame optical light than UV light. This result indicates that short GRBs arise in locations within their hosts that\ntrace the distribution of older stellar populations, and clearly do\nnot trace the sites of active star formation. This result provides\nstrong support to the claim that although most short GRB hosts\nare star forming galaxies, the bursts themselves are not related\nto the star formation activity (\u00a73).\nAt the present, the sample of events with sufficiently precise\nastrometry to determine the burst locations at the level of . 1\nHST pixel is very small (6 events). It is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about the fraction of short GRBs that\nare associated with old stellar populations as opposed to young\npopulations (as expected for young magnetars). Luckily, there\nare at least 10 additional events for which these measurements\ncan be made with future HST observations. At the present, I\nconclude that the stronger correlation of short GRBs with the\nrest-frame optical light than UV light of their hosts is indicative\nof a dominant old progenitor population.\n\n8. Conclusions\nWhile the sample of short GRBs with afterglow positions\nis still significantly smaller than that of long GRBs, we have\nmade significant progress in understanding their galactic and\nsub-galactic environments. The results of host galaxy imaging and spectroscopy, including high-resolution imaging with\nHST, point to an association of short GRBs with old stellar\npopulations within a range of normal star forming and elliptical\ngalaxies. In nearly every respect (star formation rates, metallicities, sizes, offsets, light distribution) the environments of\nshort GRBs are distinct from those of long GRBs, indicating\nthat their progenitors are not related to a young progenitor population.\nAs I showed through the study of short GRB offsets, host\ngalaxy demographics, and the redshift distribution, the current\nobservations are fully consistent with NS-NS/NS-BH binary\nmergers. However, a partial contribution from other (mainly\nold) progenitor channels (e.g., WD-WD mergers leading to\nmagnetar formation, WD/NS AIC) cannot be ruled out at the\npresent. Currently, we do not have conclusive evidence for significant progenitor kicks, which are only expected in the coalescence model. Still, a few events with sub-arcsecond optical\npositions do not directly coincide with bright host galaxies, and\nyet reside within tens of kpc from bright, low-redshift galaxies.\nThis may be suggestive of progenitor kicks, but it is also possible that these bursts are associated with fainter hosts (likely at\nhigher redshift) with marginal offsets.\nWith continued vigilance, and a short GRB discovery rate\nof about 1 event per month, we are likely to gain further insight into the nature of short GRB progenitors in the next few\nyears, possibly with the first detections (or significant limits) of\ngravitational waves. As argued in this review, host galaxy observations of existing and future events will play a central role\nin our on-going quest to determine the identity of short GRB\nprogenitors.\n\n7.4. Relation to the Host Galaxy Light Distribution\nIn addition to the projected offsets relative to their host centers, it is apparent that short GRBs are more diffusely distributed relative to their host light than long GRBs. In particular, the locations of short GRBs under-represent their overall host light distributions, even in comparison to core-collapse\nand Type Ia SNe. On the other hand, it appears from the current small sample that short GRBs are better tracers of their\n20\n\n\f9. Acknowledgements\n\nM. R. Metzger, S. G. Djorgovski, S. R. Kulkarni, C. C.
