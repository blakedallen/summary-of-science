[1], the binding potential depends only on\nthe long-range part of the atom-atom interaction, and the\ninternuclear distance is always large compared with ordinary chemical bond lengths. Theoretical description of\nthese molecules involves only the leading C3 /R3 terms of\nthe electric dipole-dipole interaction and the fine structure inside each atom. These well-known interactions\nallow precise calculation of potential wells and rovibrational energies. Previous experimental studies of such\nspectra in alkali atoms have utilized the technique of\nlaser-induced photoassociation (PA) in a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT) [2, 3]. In addition to testing calculations of\nmolecular structure, that work has produced precise measurements of excited-state lifetimes [4, 5, 6, 7] and has led\nto accurate determinations of s-wave scattering lengths\nfor alkali systems, which are of interest for studies of Bose\nEinstein condensates (BECs)[8, 9].\nThis letter reports novel spectroscopic measurements\nand calculations for extraordinarily long-range molecules\nthat are produced when two 4 He atoms in the metastable\n23 S1 state absorb laser light tuned close to the 23 S1 \u2212\n23 P0 (D0 ) atomic line at \u03bb = 1083 nm. As compared\nwith the alkali dimers considered previously, the potential wells are shallower, and molecules are much more\ntenuous, with an internuclear distance reaching values\nas large as 1150 a0 (a0 \u2243 0.53\u00c5, the Bohr radius). At\nsuch large distances, retardation clearly influences the\ndipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, these purely longrange molecular states of metastable helium are distinctive in that each atom carries a high internal energy (the\n23 S1 state lies 20 eV above the ground state).

The 5 \u03a3+\ng potential is taken\nfrom [21]. The excited potentials are calculated as described in the\ntext and are the only experimentally accessible potentials linked to\nthe 23 S1 + 23 P0 asymptote. Five bound states (v=0 to 4) lie in the\n0+\nu well. Their inner turning points are around 150 a0 , and their\nouter turning points range from 250 a0 (v=0) to 1150 a0 (v=4).\n\nThe present experiment differs significantly from reported PA measurements with 4 He in a MOT [11]. Our\natomic cloud is confined in a magnetic trap and cooled\nnearly to the BEC transition [12, 13]. The phase space\ndensity is typically six orders of magnitude higher than\nin a MOT, so the PA process is much more efficient [14].\n\n\fIn addition, our magnetically trapped atoms are spinpolarized in a single Zeeman sublevel of the 23 S1 state, so\nthe initial quasi-molecular state is 5 \u03a3+\ng . Therefore, only\nungerade excited states are accessible. Finally, whereas\nprevious PA experiments have monitored only ions or\ntrap losses, we use absorption imaging to detect heating\neffects in the atomic cloud. Molecular resonances that\nproduce no ions or very little trap loss can still be detected with our method.\nFig. 1 shows the only two potentials that can be excited in our experiment in the vicinity of the D0 atomic\nline. The photoassociation experiment consists in driving the transition from free pairs of 23 S1 atoms to bound\nstates in the purely long-range 0+\nu well connected to the\n23 S1 + 23 P0 asymptote. Measurements of the boundstate spectrum proceed as follows. About 109 atoms are\ntrapped in a MOT before being transferred into an IoffePritchard magnetostatic trap. An evaporative cooling sequence that utilizes RF-induced spin flips cools the atoms\nto 2-30 \u03bcK. The critical temperature for Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is in the range 1 to 4 \u03bcK, depending on the\ndensity [12, 23].\n\nNormalized Peak Optical Density\n\n2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\nv=0\n\nv=1\nv=2\n\n0.2\n\nv=3\nv=4\n\n0.0\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n-0.5\nPA Detuning (GHz)\n\n0.0\n\nFIG. 3: Experimental data.

We have subtracted a Lorentzian-shaped\nbackground loss due to atomic absorption and divided by a signal\nproportional to the number of atoms in the trap, yielding a \"normalized\" peak optical density signal. Each line has been probed\nseparately with different laser intensities and exposure time ranging from (0.1 \u03bcW; 20 ms) to (100 \u03bcW; 200 ms). Therefore the\nrelative depths of the five lines are not relevant.\n\n3) Probe\nGlass Cell\n\n1)\nAtomic\nBeam\n\nMagnetic trap\ncoils\n\n2) PA Laser\n\nCCD\nCamera\n\nFIG. 2:\n\nExperimental setup. 1) Metastable helium atoms are\ntrapped and evaporated down to a few \u03bcK and a peak density of\norder 1013 cm\u22123 . 2) The cloud is illuminated inside the magnetic\ntrap by the photoassociation (PA) laser for a few ms. 3) The cloud\nis released and imaged on a CCD camera after ballistic expansion.\n\nAfter cooling, the cloud is illuminated for a few ms by\nlight from a \"PA laser\" beam containing all polarization\ncomponents relative to the magnetic field axis. Just after\nthis PA pulse, the cloud is released and then detected by\nmeans of destructive absorption imaging after ballistic\nexpansion. The number of atoms, the peak optical density, and the temperature are thereby measured as functions of the PA laser frequency. Fig. 3 shows the optical\ndensity after contributions from atomic (D0 ) absorption\nhave been subtracted. For this broad scan, the PA laser is\na temperature-controlled diode laser with a 3-MHz spectral width. A Fabry-Perot cavity is used to measure the\nfrequency relative to a reference laser frequency locked\nto the 23 S1 \u2212 23 P2 atomic line. The accuracy of the PA\nfrequency in this case is 10 MHz.\n\nMore accurate spectroscopy is performed with a PA\nbeam derived from a cavity-stabilized laser (width 0.3\nMHz) locked to the D0 line. The PA beam is tuned\nto the molecular lines by acousto-optic modulators. Its\nintensity is set between 0.01 and 1 mW/cm2 , and the exposure time between 0.1 and 10 ms. With this technique\nwe can reach and zoom in on the four highest (v=1 to\nv=4) lines in the 0+\nu well. Fig. 4 shows typical experimental data for the line v=4. Figs. 4a) and 4b) demonstrate that the peak optical density drops significantly\nwhen the PA beam is resonant with a molecular line,\neven if trap loss is weak. This situation is explained by\nthe strong heating indicated in Fig. 4c. The temperature increase provides a very sensitive diagnostic for resonances that produce little loss. Assuming that the heat\ndeposited in the cloud is proportional to the number of\nmolecules produced, we fit the frequency dependence of\nthe temperature to a Lorentzian curve. The FWHM of\nthe molecular lines is measured at low intensities to be\n3.0(3) MHZ, within the expected range for the molecular\nradiative width (\u0393mol 6 2\u0393).\nThe heating mechanism that produces our signals can\nbe roughly understood as follows. After absorbing a photon near the outer turning point, the molecular system\ncan decay radiatively into two fast metastable atoms,\neach with a non-zero probability of being in the trapped\nstate. Since the trap depth is 15 mK, fast atoms can\nremain trapped and heat up the whole cloud. This reasoning is supported by the fact that we can convert the\nheating into trap loss if, during a 10 ms thermalization\ntime after the PA pulse, we apply an RF \"knife\" that removes fast atoms from the trap. The simultaneous measurement of small trap loss and significant temperature\nincrease suggests that each molecular excitation heats the\n\n\fTemp. [\u03bcK]\n\nAtom # /106\n\nPeak Opt.

The curve in graph c) is a Lorentzian fit to the data.\n\nsample considerably. This is the reason why the temperature probe is so sensitive.\nWe measure the detuning \u03b4 < 0 of the PA laser relative to the D0 atomic line. The initial 23 S1 pair undergoes an inhomogeneous Zeeman effect due to the trapping potential. Additionally, the relative kinetic energy\nof the pair is characterized by a non-zero temperature\nT . Each of these effects contributes a 32 kB T Boltzmann\nterm to the initial average energy of a pair. Hence, the\nbinding energy hb < 0 of a given vibrational state is\nhb = h\u03b4 + 2\u03bcB0 + 3kB T , where 2\u03bcB0 > 0 is the Zeeman\nshift for a 23 S1 pair at the center of the trap. Additional\nrecoil and mean-field shifts of order 10 kHz are neglected\nbecause they are much smaller than our experimental uncertainty. Each line is probed in different conditions of\nT (2 - 30 \u03bcK), B0 (300 mG - 10 G) and density (1012 5 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123 ). Within the accuracy of our experiment\nwe finally find no density or magnetic-field dependence\nof the binding energies, and for each line we estimate an\nuncertainty of \u00b10.5 MHz. Given this uncertainty and\nthe range of magnetic field explored, we can infer an upper limit for the 0+\nu magnetic moment of \u223c 0.04 Bohr\nmagnetons [24].\nIn order to interpret the experimental frequency spectrum quantitatively, we calculate the coupling between\nthe atomic orbitals of one atom in the 23 S1 state and another in the 23 PJ=0,1,2 state, which involves 54 molecular\npotentials. This coupling is constructed as a perturbative Hamiltonian in the basis of fine-structure-free atomic\nstates. At large internuclear distances R, the lowestorder term of the electromagnetic interaction is the retarded dipole-dipole interaction [15, 16], which is fully\ndetermined by the coefficient C3 = (3/4)~\u0393/k 3, where\n\n\u0393 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 1.6248 MHz [17] is the atomic linewidth, and\nk = 2\u03c0/\u03bb is the wave number. This interaction includes\nno coupling between electronic orbital and spin angular\n~ and S)\n~ and is diagonal in the molecular\nmomenta (L\nHund's case (a) basis.\n~ S\n~ coupling, the potential curves reIn the absence of Lsulting from dipole-dipole interaction are purely attractive or repulsive and have a single asymptote. When we\ninclude the atomic fine structure in the Hamiltonian [18],\nthe coupling gives rise to three distinct asymptotes and\nto anti-crossings between attractive and repulsive curves,\nleading to purely long-range potential wells [25]. We\nconstruct the fine-structure coupling phenomenologically\nfrom 23 P splittings that have been measured accurately\n[19, 20]. If there is no rotation, only the projection \u03a9 of\nthe total electronic angular momentum on the molecular\naxis remains a good quantum number. Our experiment\nprobes the 0+\nu purely long-range well plotted in Fig. 1.\nWe also consider how the rotation of the molecule can\ncouple electronic states (\u2206\u03a9 = 0, \u00b11), an effect that will\nleave \u03a9 = 0 and 0+\nu as only approximate labels. Ultimately, only the total angular momentum J remains a\ngood quantum number. Our final addition to the Hamil~ L\u2212\n~ S\n~\ntonian is the operator ~l 2 /(2\u03bcR2 ) [22], where ~\nl = J\u2212\nis the nuclear angular momentum operator. In the s-wave\nscattering regime, the initial (23 S1 + 23 S1 ) pair exists\nonly in the J = 2 state. Elementary group theory and\nBose-Einstein statistics for the nuclei [22] dictate that J\nin the excited state must be odd, namely 1 or 3. What is\nmore, the Condon radius at which the transition occurs\nis so large that the excited molecule is in almost the same\nquantum state as a non-interacting pair of atoms in the\n23 S1 + 23 P0 state (Hund's case (c)). Therefore J = 1 is\ndominant.\nThe Hamiltonian including retarded dipole-dipole interaction, fine structure, and nuclear rotation is diagonalized numerically. The 0+\nu well cited above is found\nto remain almost pure; that is, the couplings to other\n\u03a9 subspaces are very small. It is 2 GHz deep and contains 5 bound states (see Fig. 1). The inner turning\npoints of these bound states are around 150 a0 and the\nouter turning point is as large as 1150 a0 for the v=4\nvibrational state. From the discussion above, it is clear\nthat even the repulsive, inner part of the potential has\npurely long-range character; this fact distinguishes these\ndimers from those bound by usual chemical interactions.\nThe large internuclear distance is also the reason why the\nnext-order term in C6 /R6 of the electromagnetic interaction is negligible [26]. More detail about the theoretical\napproach will be given in a forthcoming paper [27].\nMeasured and calculated binding energies in the 0+\nu\nwell are presented in Table I. The measured spectrum\nagrees very well with the predicted J=1 progression, except for v=1, for which the 2 MHz discrepancy remains\nunexplained. Although it is too weak to be observed,\nthe J = 3 progression has been calculated to illustrate\nthe expected rotational splitting. Finally, comparison\nwith calculated results for a non-retarded dipole-dipole\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Measured and calculated binding energies in the 0+\nu\nwell. The first column gives the experimental results. Vibrational\nstates v=1 to v=4 are measured with a 0.5 MHz uncertainty, v=0\nwith a 10 MHz uncertainty. The next two columns give calculations following the model described in the text for J = 1 with and\nwithout including retardation effects.

Finally, this\nletter provides a foundation for a two-color, stimulated\nRaman experiment that would prepare molecules in the\nmost weakly bound state of the 5 \u03a3+\ng potential shown\n+\nin Fig. 1, with the 0u , v=0 state as an intermediate\nstate. The corresponding Franck-Condon factor of \u223c 0.1\nsuggests that the transition rate should be high. The\nlifetime of these atypical dimers formed from two 23 S1\nmetastable atoms is unknown. Moreover, an accurate\nmeasurement of the s-wave elastic scattering length of\n23 S1 helium should follow directly from the measured\nbinding energy [8].\n\nwhile neglecting retardation effects\n\ninteraction demonstrates the significant influence of retardation. We note that our measurement confirms the\nassumed value of C3 to within 0.3%.\nIn related work, we have measured other molecular\nlines, not belonging to purely long-range potentials, to\nthe red of 23 S1 + 23 P2 . Their identification is under way.\nAdditionally, an accurate measurement of the heat deposited in the cloud by decaying long-range molecules\nis in development; this could lead to a quantitative\n\n[1] W.C.
