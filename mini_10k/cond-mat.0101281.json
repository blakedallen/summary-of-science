INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently the interest in the thermo-statistical behaviour of non-extensive many-body systems,\nlike atomic nuclei, atomic clusters, soft-matter, biological systems - and also self-gravitating astrophysical systems lead to consider thermo-statistics without using the thermodynamic limit. This\nis most safely done by going back to Boltzmann.\nEinstein calls Boltzmann's definition of entropy as e.g. written on his famous epitaph\nS=k*lnW\n\n(1)\n\nas Boltzmann's principle [4] from which Boltzmann was able to deduce thermodynamics. Here W\nis the number of micro-states at given energy E of the N -body system in the spatial volume V :\nW (E, N, V ) = tr[\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N )]\n\u0012\n\u0013N\nZ\n1 d3 q d3 p\n\u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N ),\ntr[\u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N )] =\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n{q\u2282V } N !\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\u01eb0 is a suitable energy constant to make W dimensionless, \u0124N is the N -particle Hamilton-function\nand the N positions q are restricted to the volume V , whereas the momenta p are unresticted. In\n\n1\n\n\fwhat follows, we remain on the level of classical mechanics. The only reminders of the underlying\nquantum mechanics are the measure of the phase space in units of 2\u03c0h\u0304 and the factor 1/N ! which\nrespects the indistinguishability of the particles (Gibbs paradoxon). In contrast to Boltzmann [5,6]\nwho used the principle only for dilute gases and to Schr\u00f6dinger [7], who thought equation (1) is\nuseless otherwise, I take the principle as the fundamental, generic definition of entropy. In a recent\nbook [1] cf. also [2,3] I demonstrated that this definition of thermo-statistics works well especially\nalso at higher densities and at phase transitions without invoking the thermodynamic limit.\nBefore we proceed we must comment on Einstein's attitude to the principle [8]): Originally,\nBoltzmann called W the \"Wahrscheinlichkeit\" (probability), i.e. the relative time a system spends\n(along a time-dependent path) in a given region of 6N -dim. phase space. Our interpretation of\nW to be the number of \"complexions\" (Boltzmann's second interpretation) or quantum states\n(trace) with the same energy was criticized by Einstein [4] as artificial. It is exactly that criticized\ninterpretation of W which I use here and which works so excellently [1]. In section III I will come\nback to this fundamental point.\nAfter succeeding to deduce equilibrium statistics including all phenomena of phase transitions\nfrom Boltzmann's principle even for \"Small\" systems, i.e. non-extensive many-body systems, it is\nchallenging to explore how far this \"most conservative and restrictive way to thermodynamics\" [9]\nis able to describe also the approach of (eventially \"Small\") systems to equilibrium and the Second\nLaw of Thermodynamics.\nThermodynamics describes the development of macroscopic features of many-body systems without specifying them microscopically in all details. Before we address the Second Law, we have to\nclarify what we mean with the label \"macroscopic observable\".\nII. MEASURING A MACROSCOPIC OBSERVABLE, THE \" EPS-FORMULATION \"\n\nA single point {qi (t), pi (t)}i=1***N in the N -body phase space corresponds to a detailed specification of the system with all degrees of freedom (d.o.f) completely fixed at time t (microscopic\ndetermination). Fixing only the total energy E of an N -body system leaves the other (6N \u2212 1)degrees of freedom unspecified. A second system with the same energy is most likely not in the\nsame microscopic state as the first, it will be at another point in phase space, the other d.o.f. will\nbe different. I.e. the measurement of the total energy \u0124N , or any other macroscopic observable\nM\u0302 , determines a (6N \u2212 1)-dimensional sub-manifold E or M in phase space. All points in N -body\nphase space consistent with the given value of E and volume V , i.e. all points in the (6N \u2212 1)dimensional sub-manifold E(N, V ) of phase space are equally consistent with this measurement.\nE(N, V ) is the microcanonical ensemble. This example tells us that any macroscopic measurement\nis incomplete and defines a sub-manifold of points in phase space not a single point. An additional\nmeasurement of another macroscopic quantity B\u0302{q, p} reduces E further to the cross-section E \u2229 B,\na (6N \u2212 2)-dimensional subset of points in E with the volume:\nZ \u0012 3 3 \u0013N\nd qd p\n1\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N {q, p}) \u03b4(B \u2212 B\u0302{q, p})\n(4)\nW (B, E, N, V ) =\nN!\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\nIf \u0124N {q, p} as also B\u0302{q, p} are continuous differentiable functions of their arguments, what we\nassume in the following, E \u2229 B is closed. In the following we use W for the Riemann or Liouville\nvolume of a many-fold.\nMicrocanonical thermostatics gives the probability P (B, E, N, V ) to find the N -body system in\nthe sub-manifold E \u2229 B(E, N, V ):\nP (B, E, N, V ) =\n\nW (B, E, N, V )\n= eln[W (B,E,N,V )]\u2212S(E,N,V )\nW (E, N, V )\n\n(5)\n\nThis is what Krylov seems to have had in mind [10] and what I will call the \"ensemble probabilistic\nformulation of statistical mechanics (EP S) \".\nSimilarly thermodynamics describes the development of some macroscopic observable B\u0302{qt , pt }\nin time of a system which was specified at an earlier time t0 by another macroscopic measurement\n\u00c2{q0 , p0 }. It is related to the volume of the sub-manifold M(t) = A(t0 ) \u2229 B(t) \u2229 E:\n2\n\n\f1\nW (A, B, E, t) =\nN!\n\nZ \u0012\n\nd3 qt d3 pt\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n\n\u0013N\n\n\u03b4(B \u2212 B\u0302{qt , pt }) \u03b4(A \u2212 \u00c2{q0 , p0 }) \u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124{qt , pt }), (6)\n\nwhere {qt {q0 , p0 }, pt {q0 , p0 }} is the set of trajectories solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations\nq\u0307i =\n\n\u2202 \u0124\n,\n\u2202pi\n\n\u1e57i = \u2212\n\n\u2202 \u0124\n,\n\u2202qi\n\ni = 1***N\n\n(7)\n\nwith the initial conditions {q(t = t0 ) = q0 ; p(t = t0 ) = p0 }. For a very large system with N \u223c 1023\nthe probability to find a given value B(T ), P (B(t)), is usually sharply peaked as function of B.\nOrdinary thermodynamics treats systems in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e and gives only\n< B(t) >. However, here we are interested to formulate the Second Law for \"Small\" systems\ni.e. we are interested in the whole distribution P (B(t)) not only in its mean value < B(t) >.\nThermodynamics does not describe the temporal development of a single system (single point in\nthe 6N -dim phase space).\nThere is an important property of macroscopic measurements: Whereas the macroscopic constraint \u00c2{q0 , p0 } determines (usually) a compact region A(t0 ) in {q0 , p0 } this does not need to be\nthe case at later times t \u226b t0 : A(t) defined by A{q0 {qt , pt }, p0 {qt , pt }} might become a fractal i.e.\n\"spaghetti-like\" manifold as a function of {qt , pt } in E at t \u2192 \u221e and loose compactness.\nThis can be expressed in mathematical terms: There exist series of points {an } \u2208 A(t) which\nconverge to a point a\u221e which is not in A(t). E.g. such points a\u221e may have intruded from\nthe phase space complimentary to A(t0 ). Illustrative examples for this evolution of an initially\ncompact sub-manifold into a fractal set are the baker transformation discussed in this context by\nref. [11,12]. Then no macroscopic (incomplete) measurement at time t can resolve a\u221e from its\nimmediate neighbors an in phase space with distances |an \u2212 a\u221e | less then any arbitrary small \u03b4. In\nother words, at the time t \u226b t0 no macroscopic measurement with its incomplete information about\n{qt , pt } can decide whether {q0 {qt , pt }, p0 {qt , pt }} \u2208 A(t0 ) or not. I.e. any macroscopic theory like\nthermodynamics can only deal with the closure of A(t). If necessary, the sub-manifold A(t) must\nbe artificially closed to A(t) as developed further in section IV. Clearly, in this approach this is\nthe physical origin of irreversibility. We come back to this in section IV.\n\nIII. ON EINSTEIN'S OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE EPS-PROBABILITY\n\nAccording to Abraham Pais: \"Subtle is the Lord\" [8], Einstein was critical with regard to the\ndefinition of relative probabilities by eq.5, Boltzmann's counting of \"complexions\". He considered\nit as artificial and not corresponding to the immediate picture of probability used in the actual\nproblem: \"The word probability is used in a sense that does not conform to its definition as given\nin the theory of probability. In particular, cases of equal probability are often hypothetically\ndefined in instances where the theoretical pictures used are sufficiently definite to give a deduction\nrather than a hypothetical assertion\" [4]. He preferred to define probability by the relative time\na system (a trajectory of a single point moving with time in the N -body phase space) spends in\na subset of the phase space. However, is this really the immediate picture of probability used in\nstatistical mechanics? This definition demands the ergodicity of the trajectory in phase space.\nAs we discussed above, thermodynamics as any other macroscopic theory handles incomplete,\nmacroscopic informations of the N -body system. It handles, consequently, the temporal evolution\nof finite sized sub-manifolds - ensembles - not single points in phase space. The typical outcomes\nof macroscopic measurements are calculated. Nobody waits in a macroscopic measurement, e.g.\nof the temperature, long enough that an atom can cross the whole system.\nIn this respect, I think the EPS version of statistical mechanics is closer to the experimental\nsituation than the duration-time of a single trajectory. Moreover, in an experiment on a small\nsystem like a nucleus, the excited nucleus, which then may fragment statistically later on, is\nproduced by a multiple repetition of scattering events and statistical averages are taken. No\nergodic covering of the whole phase space by a single trajectory in time is demanded. At the\nhigh excitations of the nuclei in the fragmentation region their life-time would bo too short for\nthat. This is analogous to the statistics of a falling ball on a Galton's nail-board where also a\n3\n\n\fsingle trajectory is not touching all nails but is random. Only after many repetitions the smooth\nbinomial distribution is established. As I am discussing here the Second Law in finite systems, this\nis the correct scenario, not the time average over a single ergodic trajectory.\nIV. FRACTAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN PHASE SPACE, SECOND LAW\n\nHere we will first describe a simple working-scheme (i.e. a sufficient method) which allows to\ndeduce mathematically the Second Law. Later, we will show how this method is necessarily implied\nby the reduced information obtainable by macroscopic measurements.\nLet us examine the following Gedanken experiment: Suppose the probability to find our system\nat points {qt , pt }N\n1 in phase space is uniformly distributed for times t < t0 over the sub-manifold\nE(N, V1 ) of the N -body phase space at energy E and spatial volume V1 . At time t > t0 we allow\nthe system to spread over the larger volume V2 > V1 without changing its energy. If the system\nis dynamically mixing, the majority of trajectories {qt , pt }N\n1 in phase space starting from points\n{q0 , p0 } with q0 \u2282 V1 at t0 will now spread over the larger volume V2 . Of course the Liouvillean\nmeasure of the distribution M{qt , pt } in phase space at t > t0 will remain the same (= tr[E(N, V1 )])\n[13]. (The label {q0 \u2282 V1 } of the integral means that the positions {q0 }N\n1 are restricted to the\nvolume V1 , the momenta {p0 }N\n1 are unrestricted.)\n\u0012\n\u0013N\nZ\n1 d3 qt d3 pt\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N {qt , pt })\ntr[M{qt {q0 , p0 }, pt {q0 , p0 }}]|{q0 \u2282V1 } =\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n{q0 {qt ,pt }\u2282V1 } N !\n\u0012\n\u0013N\nZ\n1 d3 q0 d3 p0\n=\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N {q0 , p0 }),\n(8)\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n{q0 \u2282V1 } N !\nbecause of:\n\n\u2202{qt , pt }\n= 1.\n\u2202{q0 , p0 }\n\n(9)\n\nBut as already argued by Gibbs the distribution M{qt , pt } will be filamented like ink in water and\nwill approach any point of E(N, V2 ) arbitrarily close. M{qt , pt } becomes dense in the new, larger\nE(N, V2 ) for times sufficiently larger than t0 . The closure M becomes equal to E(N, V2 ). This is\nclearly expressed by Lebowitz [14,15].\nIn order to express this fact mathematically, we have to redefine Boltzmann's definition of entropy\neq.(1) and introduce the following fractal \"measure\" for integrals like (3) or (4):\n\u0013N\n\u0012 3\nZ\nd qt d3 pt\n1\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N {qt , pt })\n(10)\nW (E, N, t \u226b t0 ) =\nN ! {q0 {qt ,pt }\u2282V1 }\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\nWith the transformation:\nZ\nZ\n\u0001N\nd\u03c31 * * * d\u03c36N * * *\nd3 qt d3 pt * * * =\nd\u03c36N :=\n\n1\n\nX\n\n(11)\n\n\u2202 \u0124\n\u2202 \u0124\ndqi +\ndpi\n\u2202qi\n\u2202pi\n\n!\n\n1\n\ndE\n||\u2207\u0124|| i\n||\u2207\u0124||\nv\n!\n!\nu\nuX \u2202 \u0124 2 X \u2202 \u0124 2\nt\n+\n||\u2207\u0124|| =\n\u2202qi\n\u2202pi\ni\ni\nZ\n1\n\u01eb0\n,\nW (E, N, t \u226b t0 ) =\nd\u03c31 * * * d\u03c36N \u22121\n3N\nN !(2\u03c0h\u0304)\n||\u2207\u0124||\n{q0 {qt ,pt }\u2282V1 }\n=\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nwe replace M by its closure M and define now:\nW (E, N, t \u226b t0 ) \u2192 M (E, N, t \u226b t0 ) :=< G(E(N, V2 )) > \u2217volbox [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )],\nwhere < G(E(N, V2 )) > is the average of\n\n\u01eb0\nN !(2\u03c0h\u0304)3N ||\u2207\u0124||\n\n(15)\n\nover the (larger) manifold E(N, V2 ), and\n\nvolbox [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )] is the box-counting volume of M(E, N, t \u226b t0 ) which the same as the\nvolume of M, see below.\n4\n\n\fTo obtain volbox [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )] we cover the d-dim. sub-manifold M(t), here with d =\n(6N \u2212 1), of the phase space by a grid with spacing \u03b4 and count the number N\u03b4 \u221d \u03b4 \u2212d of boxes of\nsize \u03b4 6N , which contain points of M. Then we determine\nvolbox [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )] := lim\u03b4\u21920 \u03b4 d N\u03b4 [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )]\nwith lim \u2217 = inf[lim \u2217] or symbolically:\n\u0012\n\u0013N\nZ\n1 d3 qt d3 pt\nM (E, N, t \u226b t0 ) =: Bd\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N )\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n{q0 {qt ,pt }\u2282V1 } N !\n\u0013N\n\u0012 3\nZ\nd qt d3 pt\n1\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N {qt , pt })\n\u2192\nN ! {qt \u2282V2 }\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\n= W (E, N, V2 ) \u2265 W (E, N, V1 ),\n(18)\nZ\nwhere Bd means that this integral should be evaluated via the box-counting volume (16) here with\nd = 6N \u2212 1.\nThis is illustrated by the following figure\nVa\n\nVb\n\nVa + Vb\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nt < t0\n\nt > t0\n\nFIG. 1. The compact set M(t0 ), left side, develops into an increasingly folded \"spaghetti\"-like distribution in phase-space with rising time t. This figure shows only the early form of the distribution. At\nmuch larger times it will become more and more fractal and finally dense in the new phase space. The\ngrid illustrates the boxes of the box-counting method.All boxes which overlap with M(t) are counted in\nN\u03b4 in eq.(16)\n\nWith this extension of eq.(3) Boltzmann's entropy (1) is at time t \u226b t0 equal to the logarithm\nof the larger phase space W (E, N, V2 ). This is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The boxcounting is also used in the definition of the Kolmogorov entropy, the average rate of entropy gain\n[16,17]. Of course still at t0 M(t0 ) = M(t0 ) = E(N, V1 ):\n\u0013N\nd3 q0 d3 p0\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N )\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n\u0012\n\u0013N\n1 d3 q0 d3 p0\n\u01eb0 \u03b4(E \u2212 \u0124N )\nN!\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)3\n\n1\n{q0 \u2282V1 } N !\n\nZ\nM (E, N, t0 ) =: Bd\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\n{q0 \u2282V1 }\n\n\u0012\n\n= W (E, N, V1 ).\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThe box-counting volume is analogous to the standard method to determine the fractal dimension\nof a set of points [16] by the box-counting dimension:\n\n5\n\n\fdimbox [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )] := lim\u03b4\u21920\n\nln N\u03b4 [M(E, N, t \u226b t0 )]\n\u2212 ln \u03b4\n\n(21)\n\nLike the box-counting dimension, volbox has the peculiarity that it is equal to the volume of\nthe smallest closed covering set. E.g.: The box-counting volume of the set of rational numbers\n{Q} between 0 and 1, is volbox {Q} = 1, and thus equal to the measure of the real numbers ,\nc.f. Falconer [16] section 3.1. This is the reason why volbox is not a measure in its mathematical\ndefinition because then we should have\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX\nX\nvolbox [Mi ] = 0,\n(22)\n(Mi )\uf8fb =\nvolbox \uf8f0\ni\u2282{Q}\n\ni\u2282{Q}\n\ntherefore the quotation marks for the box-counting \"measure\".\nComing back to the the end of section (II), the volume W (A, B, * * * , t) of the relevant ensemble,\nthe closure M(t) must be Z\n\"measured\" by something like the box-counting \"measure\" (16,17) with\nthe box-counting integral Bd, which must replace the integral in eq.(3). Due to the fact that the\n\nbox-counting volume is equal to the volume of the smallest closed covering set, the new, extended,\ndefinition of the phase-space integral eq.(17) is for compact sets like the equilibrium distribution\nE identical to the old one eq.(3) and nothing changes for equilibrium statistics. Therefore, one\ncan simply replace the old Boltzmann-definition of the number of complexions and with it of the\nentropy by the new one (17).\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nMacroscopic measurements M\u0302 determine only a very few of all 6N d.o.f. Any macroscopic\ntheory like thermodynamics deals with the volumes M of the corresponding closed sub-manifolds\nM in the 6N -dim. phase space not with single points. The averaging over ensembles or finite\nsub-manifolds in phase space becomes especially important for the microcanonical ensemble of a\nfinite system.\nBecause of this necessarily coarsed information, macroscopic measurements, and with it also\nmacroscopic theories are unable to distinguish fractal sets M from their closures M. Therefore, I\nmake the conjecture: the proper manifolds determined by a macroscopic theory like thermodynamics are the closed M. However, an initially closed subset of points at time t0 does not necessarily\nevolve again into a closed subset at t \u226b t0 . I.e. the closure operation and the t \u2192 \u221e limit do not\ncommute, and the macroscopic dynamics becomes irreversible.\nHere is the origin of the misunderstanding by the famous reversibility paradoxes which were\ninvented by Loschmidt [18] and Zermelo [19,20] and which bothered Boltzmann so much [21,22].\nThese paradoxes address to trajectories of single points in the N -body phase space which must\nreturn after Poincarre's recurrence time or which must run backwards if all momenta are exactly\nreversed. Therefore, Loschmidt and Zermelo concluded that the entropy should decrease as well\nas it was increasing before. The specification of a single point demands of course a microscopic\nexact specification of all 6N degrees of freedom not a determination of a few macroscopic degrees\nof freedom only. No entropy is defined for a single point.\nThis way various non-trivial limiting processes can be avoided. Neither does one invoke the\nthermodynamic limit of a homogeneous system with infinitely many particles nor does one rely\non the ergodic hypothesis of the equivalence of (very long) time averages and ensemble averages.\nThe use of ensemble averages is justified directly by the very nature of macroscopic (incomplete)\nmeasurements. Coarse-graining appears as natural consequence of this. The box-counting method\nmirrors the averaging over the overwhelming number of non-determined degrees of freedom. Of\ncourse, a fully consistent theory must use this averaging explicitly. Then one would not depend\non the order of the limits lim\u03b4\u21920 limt\u2192\u221e as it was tacitly assumed here. Presumably, the rise\nof the entropy can then be already seen at finite times when the fractality of the distribution\nin phase space is not yet fully developed. The coarse-graining is no more any mathematical ad\nhoc assumption. Moreover the Second Law is in the EPS-formulation of statistical mechanics not\nlinked to the thermodynamic limit as was thought up to now [14,15].\n6\n\n\fVI. ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThanks to A.Ecker for mathematical advises. I am especially grateful to E.G.D.Cohen for his\ninterest and his constructive criticism of the ideas developed here. He turned my attention to the\nfundamental discussions in Pais' book about Einsteins view of statistical mechanics. It was through\nthe many letters exchanged with Cohen that I realized how much my way to statistical mechanics\nwas not so self-evident as I thought and departs from the main stream founded by Boltzmann and\nEinstein. He convinced me to express the fundamental ideas in detail. I hope this paper serves this\npurpose.
