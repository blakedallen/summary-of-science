We present a brief introduction to quantum sheaf cohomology,\na generalization of quantum cohomology based on the physics of the (0,2)\nnonlinear sigma model.\n\nThis paper is based on a talk given on 13 December, 2010 during the Second Latin\nCongress on Symmetries in Geometry and Physics at the Universidade Federal\ndo Paran\u00e1 in Curitiba, Brazil. Throughout, we will consider X to be a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold of complex dimension n. In addition, we will consider E \u2192 X to be a\ncomplex Hermitian vector bundle of rank k satisfying\n(i) c2 (E) = c2 (TX ),\n(ii) det E \u2228 \u223c\n= \u03c9X .\nAs these conditions imply the usual Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation conditions, we will call such a bundle omalous 1. One may consider (ii) to be an analogue\nof the usual condition for existence of the B-model. A bundle satisfying these conditions may be obtained by, for example, selecting a deformation of the tangent\nbundle when X is a projective toric variety.\n\nQuantum Cohomology\nOrdinary cohomology. We now give some elementary facts about the cohomology of X, stated in a way that will facilitate our point of view on quantum sheaf\ncohomology. Since X is K\u00e4hler, there is a Hodge decomposition on H \u2022 (X, C),\nM\nVq \u2228\nH \u2022 (X, C) \u223c\n).\nH p (X, TX\n=\np,q\n\nBy a slight abuse\nVq \u2228of language, we will refer to \u2022elements of the sheaf cohomology\ngroups H p (X, TX\n) as (p, q)-forms \u2013 clearly H (X, C) possesses a basis consisting\nof such forms.

The relationship between ordinary cohomology and quantum cohomology may be elucidated by appealing to physics \u2013 in particular to a topologicallytwisted (2,2) nonlinear sigma model of maps P1 \u2192 X. Of the many intriguing aspects of this quantum field theory, we will be most interested in its algebra of massless supersymmetric operators2. Using elementary physics arguments, one identifies\na basis for the set of such operators that may be set into one-to-one correspondence\nwith (p, q)-forms on X.\nThe (2,2) supersymmetry of the model forces the product of two massless supersymmetric operators to be massless and supersymmetric. The particular form of\nthe product obtains by considering three-point correlation functions in the quantum\nfield theory: the quantum product of two massless operators O1 and O2 is defined\nto be the unique operator (O1 \u2217 O2 ) such that for all massless operators O3 ,\n(1)\n\nh1(O1 \u2217 O2 )O3 i = hO1 O2 O3 i .\n\nV0 \u2228\n). Such a correlation\nHere, 1 denotes the operator corresponding to 1 \u2208 H 0 (X, TX\nfunction is computed using the instanton expansion\nX\nhO1 O2 O3 i\u03b2 q \u03b2 .\n(2)\nhO1 O2 O3 i =\n\u03b2\u2208H2 (X,Z)\n\nAlthough they have intrinsic meaning in physics, we will consider the expressions\nq \u03b2 to comprise a set of formal variables endowed with the structure of a monoid\nvia the product q \u03b1 q \u03b2 = q \u03b1+\u03b2 . We denote by CJqK the ring of formal power series\nwith complex coefficients in these variables \u2013 one sometimes insists on convergence\nor other properties, but such subtleties are beyond the scope of this review.\nMathematically, one defines the expression hO1 O2 O3 i\u03b2 as the Gromov-Witten invariant3 hI0,3,\u03b2 i(\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 ), where \u03c9i are the forms corresponding to the operator\nOi . Physically, one says that hO1 O2 O3 i\u03b2 q \u03b2 denotes the contribution of instantons\nof degree \u03b2 to the correlation function hO1 O2 O3 i. This expression is morally the\nintegral of induced forms on some compactification M (X, \u03b2) of the moduli space of\nholomorphic maps f : P1 \u2192 X of class \u03b2 = f\u2217 [P1 ].

The quantum cohomology of X is the Frobenius algebra\nM\nV \u2228\nQH \u2022 (X) :=\nH p (X, q TX\n)JqK,\np,q\n\nwith the product and bilinear pairing induced by (2,2) three-point functions.\nHere, the (2,2) correlation functions are defined either via Gromov-Witten invariants or as correlation functions in the quantum field theory, depending on whether\nyour tastes tend to the mathematical or to the physical.\nExample 2. The \"classical sector\" is the set of maps homotopic to a point, \u03b2 = 0,\nand the moduli space of such maps is simply X itself. Thus, in this sector, the\nquantum product reduces to the wedge product on forms; ordinary cohomology is\nthe \"classical limit\" of quantum cohomology. This sector may be isolated by setting\nq = 0. For example, the ordinary and quantum cohomology of Pn are respectively\nC[H]\n,\nhH n+1 i\n\u223c C[H]JqK .\nQH \u2022 (Pn ) =\nhH n+1 \u2212 qi\n\nH \u2022 (Pn , C) \u223c\n=\n\nHere H denotes the hyperplane class.

In\nVk\nparticular, one uses the existence of an isomorphism \u03c8 : H n (X, E) \u2192 H n (X, \u03c9X )\nto define, for a basis element \u03c9,\n\uf8f1Z\n\uf8f2 \u03c8(\u03c9) \u03c9 \u2208 H n (X, Vk E \u2228 )\n(6)\ntr(\u03c9) =\n\uf8f3 X\n0\notherwise.\nVq \u2228\nL\np\nE )\nThe pairing (\u03b1, \u03b2) 7\u2192 tr(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) induced by this trace endows\np,q H (X,\nwith the structure of a bigraded Frobenius algebra.\nPhysics. To understand the relationship between sheaf cohomology and quantum sheaf cohomology we again appeal to physics \u2013 in particular a topologicallytwisted (0,2) nonlinear sigma model of maps P1 \u2192 X. A recent physics review of\nthis and related models may be found in [McO10]. We will again be most interested in its algebra of massless supersymmetric operators4. The same elementary\nphysics arguments used for the (2,2) theory identify a basis for this set of operators\nthat may be placed into one-to-one correspondence with (p, q)-forms (that is, elements of (5)), and the quantum product of two massless operators is defined using\nthree-point correlation functions of the (0,2) in analogy to (1). Unlike the (2,2)\ncase, however, there is no mathematical definition of hO1 O2 O3 i\u03b2 in a (0,2) theory\nso the following definition is purely physical.\nDefinition 3. The quantum sheaf cohomology of an omalous bundle E \u2192 X is\nthe Frobenius algebra\nM\nVq\nQH \u2022 (X, E) :=\nH p (X, E \u2228 ) \u2297 CJqK\np,q\n\nwith the product and bilinear pairing induced by (0,2) three-point functions.\n\nAs in the case of ordinary quantum cohomology, the classical limit of quantum\nsheaf cohomology is precisely the ordinary sheaf cohomology with the Frobenius\nstructure induced by (6). Unlike the case in (2,2) theories, (0,2) supersymmetry is\nnot enough to guarantee that the product of massless operators is massless: one\nneeds to work harder to show that the algebra closes in the set of all operators.\nExistence. The (modern) history of quantum sheaf cohomology begins with\nthe observation in [ABS04] of an analogue of QH \u2022 (X) for (0, 2) theories. Therein,\nthe quantum sheaf cohomology of a one-parameter family of deformations of the\ntangent bundle of P1 \u00d7 P1 was computed using a conjectured form of mirror symmetry for (0, 2) models. Their calculations were confirmed in a sheaf-cohomologybased computation by Katz and Sharpe [KS06]. Inspired by these results, Adams,\n4As explained in [ADE06], we are actually interested in local, scalar, supersymmetric operators with vanishing holomorphic conformal weight, but for continuity we will refer to them as\nmassless supersymmetric or simply massless.\n\n\fQUANTUM SHEAF COHOMOLOGY, A PR\u00c9CIS\n\n5\n\nDistler, and Ernebjerg [ADE06] gave a physics definition of quantum sheaf cohomology and found a physics proof of two sufficient conditions for its existence. We\nrestate these conditions here as conjectures.\nConjecture 4. Let E and E \u2032 be omalous elements of a family of bundles U . Let\n\u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 U continuous with \u03b3(0) = E, \u03b3(1) = E \u2032 , \u03b3(t) omalous for all t \u2208 [0, 1].\nThen QH \u2022 (X, E) exists iff QH \u2022 (X, E \u2032 ) exists.\nConjecture 5. If E \u2192 X is omalous and rk E < 8, then QH \u2022 (X, E) exists.\nSince QH \u2022 (X, TX ) = QH \u2022 (X), the former condition implies the existence of quantum sheaf cohomology for all omalous one-parameter families of tangent-bundle\ndeformations. The latter is likely an artefact of the technique used in the physics\nproof \u2013 there are no known examples of omalous bundles of rank eight or higher for\nwhich the massless operators fail to close under the quantum product, and there\nare no physical reasons to expect such a bundle to exist.\nComputation example. Although there is no definition for the invariants\nhO1 O2 O3 i\u03b2 , a number of physics-inspired techniques exist to compute them when\nthe omalous bundle is a deformation of the tangent bundle of a toric variety\n[KS06, GK07, MM08] or a complete intersection therein[MM09]. One of the\nadvantages of using a toric variety X is that deformations of TX are easily obtained\nby deforming the Euler exact sequence:\nr\nOX\n\n0\n\nE0 M\n\nOX (D\u03c1 )\n\n0.\n\nTX\n\n\u03c1\u2208\u2206\n\nHere, r is the rank of the Picard group, \u2206 denotes the set of torus-invariant divisors\ncorresponding to one-cones in the fan of X, and E0 is a collection of sections of\nOX (D\u03c1 ), which are toric analogues of OPn (1). Taking X = P1 \u00d7 P1 , for example,\nthe sequence becomes\n0\nwhere the map is\n\n2\nOX\n\nE0\n\nOX (1, 0)2 \u2295 OX (0, 1)2\n\uf8eb\n\nx0\n\uf8ecx1\nE0 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n0\n\nTX\n\n0,\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\nx2 \uf8f8\nx3\n\nA deformation of TX may be obtained by choosing a different collection of sections\nfor the map.

Note\nthat as \u01ebi , \u03b3i \u2192 0, the quantum sheaf cohomology in (8) limits to the ordinary\nquantum cohomology of P1 \u00d7 P1 in (4).\n\nThis material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under\nDMS grant no. 0636606.\nReferences\n[ABS04] Allan Adams, Anirban Basu, and Savdeep Sethi.
