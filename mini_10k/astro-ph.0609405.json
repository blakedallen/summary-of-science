The first successful models of the explosion process invoked parameterized one-dimensional (1D) flame fronts propagating outward\nfrom the center of the star as a subsonic deflagration (Nomoto et al. 1984). However, the\nexplosion process is fundamentally three-dimensional (3D) in nature as the propagation of a\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ndeflagration front is marked by large-scale fluid motions and mixing due to Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstabilities. Recent 3D pure deflagration models are not as successful at reproducing the\nobservations because the simulated explosions are underluminous, underenergetic, inefficient\nin burning the available fuel, and result in ejecta that are too well-mixed (Reinecke et al.\n2002; Gamezo et al. 2003; Kozma et al. 2005).\nSome modelers interpret these results as requiring the burning front to make a transition\nfrom a subsonic deflagration to a supersonic detonation as it becomes turbulent (Khokhlov\n1991), though the details of how this might happen are unclear (Hillebrandt & Niemeyer\n2000). Simulations, such as those of Gamezo et al. (2005), demonstrate that models with\ndifferent prescriptions for the evolution of the burning front produce quite different ejecta\nstructures. Observational probes of the geometry and structure of the ejecta are therefore\nnecessary in light of the lack of an a priori theoretical understanding of the explosion.\nThe deviations from spherical symmetry seen in the simulations discussed above are a\nresult of the ignition process and the random physics of turbulent flame propagation. More\nsystematic departures from sphericity could be a signature of the progenitor systems, which\nare largely unknown (Branch et al. 1995; Livio 2001; Nomoto et al. 2003), or their environments. Rotational flattening of the progenitor white dwarf, interaction with circumstellar\nmaterial, or the process of merging two white dwarfs could lead to SNe Ia with large-scale\nasphericities (Howell et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2003).\nSpectropolarimetry provides a unique opportunity to probe the geometry of SNe Ia.\nOutward streaming radiation in a supernova atmosphere acquires a polarization when it\nis scattered by electrons. Distant supernovae are unresolved by the observer, so the net\npolarization of the received light represents an integration of emitted flux over the visible\nsurface of the object. In the case of a spherical supernova, symmetry demands that the total\npolarization be zero. Non-zero net polarization is therefore a sign of some deviation from\nspherical symmetry in the system (Shapiro & Sutherland 1982).\nGlobal asphericities of the photosphere, such as ellipsoidal deformations, are manifested\nas net continuum polarization (Jeffery 1991; H\u00f6flich 1991). Past investigations of SNe Ia\nhave found typical intrinsic polarizations of order a few tenths of a percent in the continuum. The object with the highest measured intrinsic continuum polarization percentage is\nstill the subluminous SN 1999by (Howell et al. 2001), which showed at least 0.7% polarization. Howell et al. (2001) found that the spectropolarimetric data could be modeled by an\noblate spheroid with an axial length ratio of 1.17, seen nearly equator-on. The lower continuum polarizations measured in the half-dozen other SNe Ia with good data are consistent\nwith global asphericities at the \u223c10% level (Wang et al. 2003, 2006; Leonard et al. 2005;\nChornock et al. 2006).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nLine polarization allows other approaches to the study of asphericity. Polarization modulations and angle rotations across a spectral feature could be a sign of an aspherical distribution of that ionic species. Leonard et al. (2005) found that the angle rotations seen in\nspectral features of some SNe Ia could be due to clumps or ionization asymmetries in the\nejecta. Even if the ejecta lack such compositional inhomogeneities, line polarization can give\ninsight into the global asphericity of the ejecta. Photons scattered in a line are generally depolarized (H\u00f6flich et al. 1996), but in a purely ellipsoidal geometry we should expect strong,\nisolated lines to be associated with \"inverted\" P-Cygni polarization line profiles (Jeffery\n1989). The effect of many overlapping lines is to produce a decrease in the polarization at\nthe same angle as the continuum, as was seen in SN 1999by (Howell et al. 2001). These signatures of asphericity are largely independent of the uncertainties in the removal of interstellar\npolarization (ISP) that plague estimates of the continuum polarization.\nOne exciting recent development in SN Ia research is the association of \"high-velocity\"\n(HV) features in the flux spectra with strong spectropolarimetric features. These HV features are so-named because they are signatures of a separate line-formation region at higher\nvelocities than the normal photospheric component. Separate HV material was first noticed\nin the Fe II lines of SN 1994D by Hatano et al. (1999), but it may be ubiquitous in SNe Ia.\nEvery object in the sample of Mazzali et al. (2005b) showed evidence of HV absorption in\nthe Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet if the spectra were taken at sufficiently early epochs.\nThe HV Ca II NIR triplet feature in the otherwise-normal SN 2001el was responsible for a 0.7% spectropolarimetric feature that was rotated with respect to the continuum\n(Wang et al. 2003; Kasen et al. 2003). This feature was modeled as forming in a spatially separate region that did not share an axis of symmetry with the continuum (Kasen et al. 2003).\nSubsequent observations of the SNe Ia 2004dt and 2002bf (Leonard et al. 2005; Wang et al.\n2006) also showed strong polarization modulations across the HV lines. The composition\nand origin of this HV material remain mysterious. Suggestions in the literature have included clumps of material newly synthesized in the explosion (Wang et al. 2003), signatures\nof a gravitationally confined detonation (Kasen & Plewa 2005), and interaction with circumstellar material (Wang et al. 2003; Gerardy et al. 2004; Mazzali et al. 2005a). In all cases,\nviable models for the origin of the HV material must recognize its intrinsically 3D nature,\nas revealed by the spectropolarimetric line features and angle rotations.\nInverting the observed polarization data for one object to construct a model is highly\nunderconstrained. A more fruitful approach is to collect data for a sample of objects to see\nwhich, if any, model can best match the range of observed polarimetric behaviors. Though\nobservations are still sparse, Leonard et al. (2005) have shown that SNe Ia exhibit diverse\npolarimetric characteristics that may correlate with other photometric and spectroscopic\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nproperties. For example, the two SNe Ia with the highest observed intrinsic continuum polarizations are both subluminous, and the objects with HV features have shown the largest\nline polarizations. In addition, Wang, Baade, & Patat (2007) have claimed to find a correlation between the strength of the spectropolarimetric modulation across the Si II \u03bb6355\nfeature and the light-curve shape (a luminosity indicator) for a sample of SNe Ia.\nIn this paper we add to the small sample of SNe Ia observed spectropolarimetrically\nand present a single epoch of high signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) observations of SN 2004S, a\nSN Ia with HV features that is a virtual twin of SN 2001el. The data were taken 9 d after\nmaximum light and the observed continuum polarization provides evidence for asphericity\nin the ejecta. Deviations from axisymmetry, seen as spectropolarimetric modulations across\nprominent spectral lines, are the main result and focus of the discussion below.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nSN 2004S in MCG \u221205\u201316\u2013021 was discovered by R. Martin on 2004 February 3.542 (UT\ndates are used throughout this paper; Martin & Briggs 2004) and spectroscopically identified\nas a SN Ia by Suntzeff et al. (2004). Optical photometry of SN 2004S has been published\nby both Misra et al. (2005) and Krisciunas et al. (2007), with the latter authors adding a\nsignificant near-IR light curve. They both find SN 2004S to be photometrically normal\nand we adopt a date for B-band maximum light of February 4.37 \u00b1 0.25 (Krisciunas et al.\n2007). Krisciunas et al. (2007) emphasize that SN 2004S and SN 2001el were found to be\nphotometric twins. In addition, the spectra were very similar, with both objects showing a\nstrong HV component to the Ca II NIR triplet lines at early times.\nWe observed SN 2004S on 2004 February 13.34 (+9 d after maximum light) for a total of\n3600 s using the polarimeter unit1 of the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke\net al. 1995) on the Keck I 10-m telescope. The D560 dichroic beamsplitter sent blue light to\na 400/3400 grism and transmitted red light to the 400/8500 grating. The 1.5\u2032\u2032 -wide slit gave\na spectral resolution of about 9 \u00c5 over the full observed wavelength range of 3040\u20139250 \u00c5.\nThe slit was aligned at 180\u25e6, which was near the parallactic angle for the first observation.\nConditions were good and the seeing was \u223c0.9\u2032\u2032 during these observations.\nStandard two-dimensional (2D) image-processing tasks were performed using the pack1\n\nSee http://alamoana.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/lris/polarimeter/manual/pol_v3.ps for the online\npolarimeter manual by M. Cohen (2005).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nages in IRAF2 , as were the optimal extraction of spectra and wavelength calibration. We\nused our own routines for flux calibration and atmospheric absorption correction of the 1D\nspectra (Matheson et al. 2000). The high airmass (\u223c1.6) and fixed position angle of the\nslit combined to make the effects of atmospheric dispersion (Filippenko 1982) apparent in\nour data. As the first observation was taken close to the parallactic angle, we adjusted the\ncontinuum slope of the combined flux spectrum to that of the first observation by dividing\nthe total spectrum by a low-order spline fit to the ratio of the two spectra.\nThe spectropolarimetric reductions followed the standard procedure outlined by Miller et al.\n(1988) and implemented by Leonard et al. (2001). The zero point of the waveplate was\ndetermined by setting the observed position angle of the polarization standard star BD\n+59 389 to the catalogued value of 98.09\u25e6 (Schmidt et al. 1992). As a check on the polarization angle, we also observed a lower-quality polarization standard, HD 127769. The\nliterature measurements for the polarization vary somewhat, and the published angles are\n54.0\u25e6 and 52.7\u25e6 (Clemens & Tapia 1990; Mathewson & Ford 1970). We measured an angle\nof 52.5\u25e6 , which allows us to conclude that our observation of BD +59 389 gave a reliable zero\npoint. Two null polarization standards, HD 109055 and HD 57702 (Berdyugin et al. 1995;\nClemens & Tapia 1990; Mathewson & Ford 1970), were also observed and had negligible\npolarization (P < 0.07%).\nDichroic absorption by interstellar dust along the line of sight polarizes light from the\nsupernova. We selected two stars, CD \u221231 3659 and HD 48649, to act as probes of the\nGalactic contribution to the total ISP and observed them immediately after the supernova.\nBoth are A-type stars more than 150 pc above the Galactic plane and within 0.6\u25e6 of SN\n2004S; they can be regarded as intrinsically unpolarized probes that are distant enough\nto sample almost all of the dust along that line of sight out of our Galaxy, following the\nsuggestion of Tran (1995).\nThe same dust that polarizes also reddens the light, which allows us to anticipate\nthe magnitude of the effect of ISP. The Galactic extinction along the line of sight has\nE(B \u2212V ) = 0.101 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998). Empirically, dust in our Galaxy shows a\npolarization efficiency (PM AX / E(B \u2212V )) of typically 3% mag\u22121 , with a maximum value\nof 9% mag\u22121 (Serkowski et al. 1975), so we should expect the polarization to be \u223c0.3%\nif the line of sight is typical, up to a maximum of 0.9%. We integrated the flux-weighted\nStokes parameters over 5050\u20135950 \u00c5 to approximate the V -band polarization (qV ,uV ) and\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO), which is operated by the\nAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmeasured (0.03, 0.49) and (0.11, 0.30), respectively, for the two probe stars. The two stars\nhave somewhat different polarization, so we averaged their Stokes parameters to form our\nestimate of the Galactic ISP. Smoothed versions of q and u were then subtracted from the\nSN 2004S observations. Uncertainties in the determination of the Galactic ISP are absorbed\ninto the determination of the host-galaxy contribution to ISP below.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nTotal-Flux Spectrum\n\nThe high S/N total-flux spectrum is presented in Figure 1 along with a spectrum of the\nprototypical normal Type Ia SN 1989B (Wells et al. 1994). We have removed a radial velocity\nfor the host galaxy of SN 2004S of 2808 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 (determined from 21-cm observations by\nTheureau et al. (2005)) from all plots in this paper. The SN 1989B spectrum is from 8 d after\nB-band maximum light and is very similar to our SN 2004S spectrum, confirming that the\nage inferred from the photometry is accurate. Wells et al. (1994) measured the photometric\ndecline-rate parameter (Phillips 1993) for SN 1989B to be \u2206m15 (B) = 1.31 \u00b1 0.07 mag,\ncompared to the value of 1.14 \u00b1 0.01 mag reported by Krisciunas et al. (2007) for SN 2004S.\nWe shall use the fiducial SN 1989B spectrum as a reference to better understand\nSN 2004S. The most obvious difference between the two spectra is that the absorptions\ndue to Ca II are significantly deeper in SN 2004S and extend to much higher velocities.\nSN 2004S otherwise appears to be spectroscopically quite normal for a SN Ia (Filippenko\n1997). A more complete spectroscopic sequence is presented in Krisciunas et al. (2007),\nalong with comparisons to a suite of SNe Ia.\nFigure 2 shows a closer view of the spectral features due to Ca II and Si II. The Si II\n\u03bb6355 line in particular is the hallmark of SNe Ia and is frequently used to measure the\nphotospheric velocity (e.g., Branch et al. 1988). As shown in the middle panel of Figure 2,\nthe absorption minimum of the Si II line in SN 1989B is at \u223c10,000 km s\u22121 , a typical value\nfor a SN Ia. The Si II feature in SN 2004S is noticeably weaker and the minimum is at\nonly 8900 km s\u22121 , compared to the figure of 9300 km s\u22121 reported by Suntzeff et al. (2004)\nnear B-band maximum light. This velocity is actually quite low for a normal SN Ia at this\nepoch and is comparable to the lowest-velocity objects in the sample of Benetti et al. (2005).\nOnly peculiar subluminous objects such as SNe 1991bg and 2002cx have shown lower Si II\nvelocities at a similar age (Leibundgut et al. 1993; Li et al. 2003).\nBy contrast, Figure 2 shows that the Ca II spectral features in SN 2004S were formed\nat higher velocities than in SN 1989B. The Ca II H&K \u03bb\u03bb3934, 3968 absorption feature in\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSN 1989B has a minimum at 3795 \u00c5 (11,600 km s\u22121 ) and a rather flat-bottomed absorption\nwith the blue wing rising to a flux maximum at 3675 \u00c5 (21,200 km s\u22121 ), where the velocities\nreported here are relative to the gf -weighted line wavelength of 3945 \u00c5. In SN 2004S, the\nabsorption is much deeper and the flux minimum is much bluer, at 3710 \u00c5 (18,400 km s\u22121 ),\nwith absorption extending outward to 3600 \u00c5 (27,400 km s\u22121 ).\nThe profile of the Ca II NIR triplet shown in Figure 2 is more complicated than the\nother two lines, with at least three distinct flux minima present near 8080, 8230, and 8385\n\u00c5. Two effects contribute to the complexity of this line profile. The first is that the feature is intrinsically formed by a triplet and the wavelength separation of the components is\nrelatively large. The minima at 8385 and 8230 \u00c5 can then be identified with Ca II \u03bb8662\nand \u03bb\u03bb8498, 8542, respectively, with a blueshift of 10,000\u201311,000 km s\u22121 . Absorption minima at similar velocities can be be seen in the reference spectrum of SN 1989B. SN 2004S\nshows an additional flux minimum near 18,000 km s\u22121 with no corresponding feature in\nSN 1989B, which we identify as the counterpart of the high-velocity absorption seen in Ca II\nH&K. There are therefore two Ca II line-forming regions in SN 2004S, one at the photosphere and a second one separated from the photosphere by 8,000 km s\u22121 . No photospheric\ncomponent is visible in the H&K feature, which is dominated by the HV component. The\nspectral sequence of SN 2004S presented by Krisciunas et al. (2007) shows the evolution of\nthe Ca II NIR triplet absorption profile from being dominated by HV material at early times\nto photospheric velocities at late times.\nThe exact velocity range of this HV absorption is difficult to determine directly from\nthe spectrum because of confusion caused by line blending. If the minimum at 8080 \u00c5 is\nidentified with \u03bb8542, then the apparent velocity is 16,700 km s\u22121 , but at that velocity the\n\u03bb8662 line would produce an absorption at 8190 \u00c5, which is close a local maximum in the\nline profile. It is likely that the HV material is at slightly higher velocity (such as 18,000\nkm s\u22121 ), but with a velocity spread sufficient to blend the two components of the line profile\ntogether. A spectral synthesis calculation is necessary to make a more quantitative estimate\nof the velocity spread of the HV material. The maximum velocity of the absorbing material\nis easier to isolate, as the blue edge of the feature is at 7880 \u00c5 (24,000 km s\u22121 if identified\nwith \u03bb8542).\nAs with all supernova spectral features, blends with other lines due to the large Doppler\nshifts may affect the strength and apparent wavelength of any given spectral feature. In\nparticular, Si II \u03bb3858 and O I \u03bb8446 are candidates for making a potential contribution\nto the H&K and NIR triplet features, respectively. We do feel confident in identifying the\npresence of a high-velocity absorption component in Ca II, especially with the simultaneous\ndetection of a feature at a similar velocity in both the H&K and NIR triplet features. We\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nnote that no HV component is obvious in the profile of the Si II \u03bb6355 line. There are\nnotches in the blue wing, but these are the early signs of incipient iron lines that strengthen\nwith time, not HV features (see the spectral sequence in Krisciunas et al. 2007).\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectropolarimetry\n\nThe last step of preparation before we can begin analysis of the spectropolarimetry is\nto correct the data for ISP in the host galaxy. Normal SNe Ia have well-defined colors as a\nfunction of age, so Misra et al. (2005) were able to estimate a total E(B \u2212V ) to SN 2004S\nof 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 mag by comparison with templates. The numbers given above imply that the\nhost galaxy contributes E(B \u2212V ) \u2248 0.08 mag of reddening, so we expect a typical host ISP\nof \u223c0.24% (Serkowski et al. 1975). Krisciunas et al. (2007) used the long baseline of their\noptical through NIR observations to set a tighter constraint on the extinction. They derive\na host extinction of AV = 0.071 \u00b1 0.043 mag, which would imply a host ISP of 0.07% for\ntypical dust, up to a maximum of 0.21%. Unlike the Galactic ISP, we have no method to\ndirectly measure the host contribution, so we will have to appeal to some interpretation of\nthe SN polarimetry itself to make an ISP estimate. This ISP estimate will not be unique\nbecause different assumptions about the intrinsic SN polarization can lead to different ISP\nestimates.\nSome of the SN 2004S spectropolarimetry data are plotted in the Stokes q \u2212 u plane\nin Figure 3. Each circle represents a wavelength bin 50 observed \u00c5 wide and the size of\neach is proportional to the wavelength of the bin it represents, so larger circles are from\nlonger wavelengths. Anticipating the results below, we only plot data points from sections\nof the spectrum that we believe are free from strong line polarization features. The exact\nwavelength choices for these \"continuum\" data points are marked in the middle panel of\nFigure 4. The wavelength dependence of ISP is sufficiently weak at optical wavelengths\n(Serkowski et al. 1975) that the effect of subtracting a small ISP is similar to choosing a\nnew origin for the data in the q \u2212 u plane. The distribution of plotted wavelength bins is\nelongated, with a clear spread of at least 0.4% in polarization between the blue end of the\nspectrum (smaller points) and the red end (larger points), which must be due to intrinsic\nSN polarization. The dotted circle in Figure 3 has a radius of 0.21%, corresponding to the\nmaximum expected host ISP.\nThe line plotted in Figure 3 is a fit to the data points. The simplest decomposition\nof the polarization is to choose an ISP vector that lies on the line and to assign the remaining polarization to intrinsic SN polarization that varies in amplitude as a function of\nwavelength, with most of the variation occurring along the axis defined by the line. The\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndirection indicated by the line could then represent the symmetry axis of the SN continuum\nas projected onto the sky (Wang et al. 2001). This argument does not give a unique value\nfor the ISP, so we will appeal to SN Ia theory and spectral modeling calculations to assume\nthat the intrinsic polarization at blue wavelengths must be small. As Howell et al. (2001)\nhave argued, many overlapping lines of iron-peak elements are the dominant form of opacity\nin SNe Ia at wavelengths below 6000 \u00c5. The opacity from these lines should destroy any\npolarization caused by electron scattering in an aspherical SN atmosphere. Howell et al.\n(2001) then chose an ISP vector to make the polarization zero at the blue end of their data.\nOther authors (Leonard et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2006; Chornock et al. 2006) have chosen\nISP vectors to make the intrinsic polarization of certain blue emission features zero.\nFor this work, we will select an ISP vector (qISP ,uISP ) that lies on the line in Figure 3.\nThe exact point along this line is arbitrary, but we chose the point (\u22120.040, \u22120.159), which\nwe have marked with a square, in order to make the polarization small at blue wavelengths. A\nhost ISP of this magnitude is consistent with the reddening constraints mentioned above. We\nsubtracted an ISP with the wavelength dependence of Serkowski et al. (1975) and assumed\nRV = AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1.\n1\n\nThe formal polarization [P = (q 2 + u2 ) 2 ] is positive-definite and is therefore biased high\nfor low values of the polarization. We can avoid this bias by continuing to represent the data\nby two Stokes parameters, but we are free to choose a more convenient parameterization\nof rotated Stokes parameters (RSP; Trammell et al. 1993). In this case, we will rotate the\nISP-subtracted data to align one Stokes parameter (called qRSP ) with the obvious axis seen\nin the continuum data in Figure 3 and marked by the line. This coordinate system is similar\nto the decomposition of polarization into a dominant and orthogonal axis by Wang et al.\n(2003), except that we have explicitly excluded wavelengths of strong line polarization from\nthe fit.\nThe rotated SN 2004S spectropolarimetry is plotted in Figure 4. After the rotation, most\nof the continuum polarization is in the qRSP Stokes parameter. The polarization rises from\nnear zero at 4000 \u00c5 to a maximum of 0.4% at 6800 \u00c5 before declining at longer wavelengths.\nSeveral broad undulations in the continuum polarization are apparent as well as narrower\nfeatures associated with spectral lines seen in the flux spectrum. Five of these narrower\nfeatures are also visible as strong negative departures from the continuum in the uRSP\nparameter and hence as rotations in \u03b8. Spectral windows away from these narrower features\nare mostly flat and near zero in uRSP despite the broad undulations in qRSP , justifying our\ndecomposition of the polarization into these Stokes parameters. We now consider the line\nfeatures in more detail.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.2.1. Silicon\nWe will first examine the polarization of the Si II \u03bb6355 line because it is the most\nisolated and can be used as a reference to understand the other spectropolarimetric features.\nAs noted above, the continuum polarization of SN 2004S is confined to qRSP , while Figure 4\nshows that the Si II line has excursions away from the continuum polarization in both qRSP\nand uRSP . We can immediately conclude that the Si II line-formation region does not share\nan axis of symmetry with the continuum.\nThis point is reinforced in the upper-left panel of Figure 5, where data points from\nboth the continuum and the line are plotted in the q \u2212 u plane. The continuum points are\nthe same as in Figure 3, but rotated into the new coordinate system and shown in gray.\nThe elongation of the continuum points along a line in the q \u2212 u plane was argued above\nto be representative of scattering in a geometry with a single well-defined axis. The data\npoints in black with error bars are 50 \u00c5 bins between wavelengths of 5900 and 6400 \u00c5.\nThese line polarization points clearly do not share the same distribution in the q \u2212 u plane\nas the continuum. They are arranged along a linear axis that is rotated with respect to, and\nintersects the major axis of, the spread of continuum points.\nAnother view of the same data can be seen in the leftmost panels of Figure 6, where the\nStokes parameters are plotted as a function of velocity in the line in 20 \u00c5 bins. The Si II\n\u03bb6355 line is located in the middle of a broad depression in qRSP , which has local maxima\nnear 5700 and 6800 \u00c5. There is a narrower, sharp feature in qRSP located just blueward of\nthe minimum of the line in the flux spectrum. This feature is at a similar velocity as the\nlargest negative depression in uRSP . The flux minimum of the line is at 8900 km s\u22121 and\nthe greatest deviation of the line polarization from the continuum is in the narrow range of\napproximately 9,000-11,000 km s\u22121 , just above the photosphere.\nInterestingly, as one moves to redder wavelengths from the flux minimum of the \u03bb6355\nline, uRSP increases from its minimum, crosses zero near 6350 \u00c5 (\u223c0 km s\u22121 ), and rises to a\npeak in the red wing of the emission component of the line. This positive excursion in uRSP\nreturns to zero (the continuum value) near 6700 \u00c5, corresponding to a redshift of \u223c16,000\nkm s\u22121 , which may be a spectropolarimetric indication of Si II forming in the far side of the\nejecta almost as far out as the expansion velocity derived above for the HV line-formation\nregion.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.2.2. Calcium\nThe next ionic species we examine is Ca II. The analysis of the flux spectrum above\npresented evidence for two Ca II line-formation regions, at 10,000 and 18,000 km s\u22121 , making\nthe shape of the NIR triplet in the flux spectrum complicated. The polarization profile of\nthe NIR triplet shown in Figure 4 is also complex. Two separate polarization features are\nseen in both qRSP and uRSP near 8165 and 8345 \u00c5.\nThe presence of two line-formation regions makes interpretation of the polarimetric\nfeatures ambiguous, but the rightmost panels of Figure 6 can clarify the situation. The three\nlines labeled \"HV\" in the top right panel mark the expected location of features associated\nwith the three components of the triplet, blueshifted by the 18,000 km s\u22121 velocity of the HV\nline-formation region seen in the total-flux spectrum. The stronger of the two polarimetric\nfeatures is at the same velocity as the expected \u03bb8662 line, but no feature is seen at the\nexpected position of the other two lines. A much more natural identification of the lines\ncan be seen in the lower-right panel. The lines labeled \"PV\" mark the expected location of\nfeatures associated with the NIR triplet if they occur at the same velocity (10,000 km s\u22121 )\nas the strongest polarization feature in the Si II line. The redder of the two polarization\nfeatures is formed over a velocity range of 9,500\u221212,500 km s\u22121 if it is identified as Ca II\n\u03bb8662. The bluer of the two features is then a blend of \u03bb8498 and \u03bb8542 forming at similar\nvelocities. In this interpretation, the two polarimetric features are formed at velocities just\nabove the local minima in the total-flux spectrum (\u223c11,000 km s\u22121 ), similar to the behavior\nof the Si II \u03bb6355 line discussed in the previous section.\nThe data points plotted in the q \u2212 u plane in the lower-left panel of Figure 5 are 50 \u00c5\nbins between 8050 and 8300 \u00c5 and correspond to the polarization feature we associated with\n\u03bb\u03bb8498, 8542. Data points from the \u03bb8662 feature, spanning 8300 to 8500 \u00c5, are plotted in\nthe lower-right panel. In each panel the data points are connected in order of wavelength by a\nline. The location of these two features in the q\u2212u plane reveals complex spectropolarimetric\nbehavior. Not only do these Ca II \u03bb\u03bb8498, 8542 data points show a spread of 0.4% in each\nStokes parameter, which is itself indicative of deviations from simple axisymmetry, but the\nline connecting the data points shows that the path in the q \u2212 u plane is ordered in the form\nof a loop. This is in contrast with the Si II data, which form a linear feature. The \u03bb8662\nfeature shows a similar 2D spread with a suggestion of a loop, though with lower statistical\nsignificance.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.2.3. Iron\nNext we will consider the two features visible in Figure 4 as deviations from the continuum in both uRSP and \u03b8 near 4800 \u00c5. The spectra of SNe Ia in this wavelength region\nare formed by a complicated blend of lines (mostly Fe II, S II, and Si II), so the identity\nof any given spectral feature is ambiguous. The wavelengths of the strongest rotations in\nthese features are at about 4745 and 4832 \u00c5. We first assume that the spectropolarimetric\nfeatures are formed in a similar manner to the Si II line analyzed above. The narrow core\nof the polarization feature in the Si II line was centered at an expansion velocity of \u223c10,000\nkm s\u22121 . De-blueshifting the unknown features by this velocity implies rest wavelengths of\n4906 and 4996 \u00c5 for our mystery lines. The Ca II NIR triplet polarization feature was formed\nat a velocity of 11,000 km s\u22121 , which would imply rest wavelengths of 4922 and 5013 \u00c5 for\nthese lines.\nOne reasonable identification is with Fe II \u03bb\u03bb4924, 5018 if those lines are blueshifted\nby \u223c11,000 km s\u22121 . There are two major complications for this interpretation. The first\nis that those Fe II lines form a triplet with \u03bb5169. All three lines share the same lower\natomic level, so they should all be present if one of them is. With this identification, the\nstronger spectropolarimetric feature is associated with \u03bb4924, the weaker one with \u03bb5018,\nand \u03bb5169 lacks a counterpart. This ordering by strength of spectropolarimetric features is\nthe reverse of the ordering by weighted oscillator strengths (gf ). Naively, one might expect\nthe strongest line to produce the strongest polarimetric feature, much as the strongest of the\nthree lines produces the strongest feature in the flux spectrum.\nThe second complication can be seen in the flux spectrum in Figure 1. A series of\nflux minima at 4698, 4772, and 4885 \u00c5 are labeled as Fe II. If this identification is correct,\nthe three components of the triplet are blueshifted by 14,000, 15,000, and 17,000 km s\u22121 ,\nrespectively. These velocities are much greater than the photospheric velocity measured from\nthe Si II line, similar to the HV Ca II features discussed above, and thus raise the specter of\nmultiple Fe II line-forming regions, one at photospheric velocity and one at high velocity. HV\nFe II was first invoked by Hatano et al. (1999) to model the early-time spectra of SN 1994D\nand has since been used by several authors to explain spectra of SNe Ia before and near\nmaximum light (e.g., Stehle et al. 2005). Branch et al. (2006) found that their spectral fits\nto a number of SNe Ia were improved with the addition of HV Fe II. Suggestively, they also\nfound that the object in their sample whose fit required the highest optical depth in HV Fe II\nwas SN 2001el, which also had strong HV Ca II absorption. Spectral fits that lack HV Fe II\nhave difficulty producing alternative identifications for these absorption minima in SNe Ia.\nThese difficulties with the Fe II interpretation lead to the natural question of whether\nany other ionic species could be responsible. The first alternative identifications we consider\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nare Si II and Ca II because these species are known to produce polarized spectral features\nat other wavelengths in this object. Ca II has no strong spectral features in this wavelength\nregion, but the Si II \u03bb5051 blend is a plausible candidate for creating a spectropolarimetric\nfeature. Wang et al. (2006) identified a feature from this line in SN 2004dt, but in SN 2004S\nthis single line would have to explain two polarimetric features. These features would be at\nexpansion velocities of 18,700 and 13,300 km s\u22121 , significantly different from the polarimetric\nbehavior of the strong Si II line (\u03bb6355), so we reject the Si II interpretation.\nThe most plausible remaining candidate ion is S II, which has a large number of transitions in the optical. Blends of these lines, particularly between 4500 and 5700 \u00c5, make a\ncontribution to the spectra of SNe Ia. The strongest spectroscopic feature in the flux spectrum attributed to S II in SNe Ia is the \"W\"-shaped absorption near 5300 \u00c5 (see Figure 1).\nNo strong spectropolarimetric feature is visible in Figure 4 near this wavelength. An identification of the polarimetric features with S II would have to explain why the weaker lines\nleave a polarimetric signature and the stronger ones do not.\nWe will adopt the identification of these lines with Fe II for the rest of the paper, noting\nthe caveats above. Data points from these two lines (50 \u00c5 bins between 4650 and 5000 \u00c5)\nare plotted in the upper-right panel of Figure 5. The distribution of points in the q \u2212 u plane\nis elongated in a linear manner along a direction roughly parallel to the linear feature seen in\nSi II, possibly indicating a common origin for the spectropolarimetric features. The middle\npanels of Figure 6 show the same data in velocity space. The expected locations of the\nthree members of the triplet if they were present at the 15,000 km s\u22121 velocity inferred from\nthe flux spectrum are marked in the qRSP panel, while the uRSP panel shows the expected\nposition of features at 10,000 km s\u22121 as measured from the Si II polarization feature. The\npolarimetric line features do not fall at the same position as the HV notches in the flux\nspectrum, but they do correspond to the positions of two of the three lines at photospheric\nvelocities.\nOne possible explanation for the lack of a polarimetric counterpart to \u03bb5169 is to rely\non the observed narrowness of the sharp spectropolarimetric feature seen in the core of the\nSi II line and at the photospheric velocity in the Ca II NIR triplet. Perhaps whatever\nnon-axisymmetric asphericity (e.g., clumping) is the cause of the spectropolarimetric line\nfeatures and rotations in the other species is narrowly confined in the ejecta. Stronger\nlines are optically thick through more of the ejecta, possibly including the less dense spaces\nbetween clumps. If the \u03bb5169 line (with the largest gf -value) is optically thick over more of\nthe ejecta than the other Fe II lines, then the signature of the asphericity could be hidden.\nAnother possibility is that blending with another line (Si II \u03bb5051 at photospheric velocities\nis a possible candidate) destroys the polarization signature.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n3.2.4. Non-detections\nIt is also worth considering which line features do not show spectropolarimetric features,\nas well as those that do. The S/N of our observations degrades rapidly blueward of 4000\n\u00c5 due to declining efficiency of the spectrograph and increasing atmospheric absorption.\nDespite these mitigating effects, we are confident that Figure 4 shows no sign of strong\nspectropolarimetric features associated with the Ca II H&K lines of the sort seen in the NIR\ntriplet lines of the same species. One potential explanation is that, if our choice of ISP is\ncorrect, the continuum at such short wavelengths has negligible polarization due to the high\nopacity in lines from iron-peak elements. The additional opacity of the strong H&K lines\nthen results in little additional depolarization.\nTwo of the more interesting ionic species that lack strong polarimetric signatures are\nO I and S II. Oxygen in the ejecta of SNe Ia could either be unprocessed material from the\nprogenitor white dwarf or the result of incomplete carbon burning. In either case the oxygen\nshould not share the same spatial distribution as the silicon. SN 2004dt (Leonard et al. 2005;\nWang et al. 2006) showed the combination of strong polarization in the HV Si II line features\nand a lack of a feature at the O I line, which Wang et al. (2006) interpreted to be a result\nof turbulent burning processes leaving clumpy intrusions of silicon in an oxygen-dominated\nsubstrate. The O I \u03bb7773 line in SN 2004S is of normal strength (see Figure 1), with a flux\nminimum near a radial velocity of 9,000 km s\u22121 . No strong polarization feature is visible in\nFigure 4 in uRSP , and there is marginal evidence for an increase in qRSP . Unfortunately, this\nline falls near the strongest atmospheric absorption at optical wavelengths (the A band) and\nso the S/N is somewhat degraded.\nSulfur, however, should have a spatial distribution similar to that of silicon, as both\nelements are formed by similar burning processes. S II is responsible for the characteristic\n\"W\"-shaped feature near 5300 \u00c5 in SNe Ia before maximum light, as well as more minor\nfeatures just blueward of that. At this late epoch, the \"W\"-shaped feature has started to\nfade and the redder absorption is being dominated by the increased effect of iron on the\nspectrum at these wavelengths. We see no strong modulation in qRSP at the position of the\nS II features and uRSP definitely lacks the strong feature seen in the Si II line. Differences\nin polarization behavior between the two species despite similar spatial distributions could\nbe a result of different optical depths in the lines, or the underlying continuum polarization\ncould be modified differently by the blends of lines from iron-peak elements.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe most basic question to be answered by spectropolarimetry is whether or not an\nobject is spherically symmetric. The strong wavelength dependence of the polarimetric data\nshown above is convincing evidence of intrinsic polarization and hence of deviations from\nspherical symmetry in the ejecta of SN 2004S.\nWith the set of Stokes parameters that we have chosen to present the data, qRSP would\nbe an estimator of the total polarization if the system had a well-defined symmetry axis. The\nneed for a second variable to describe the data, here the Stokes parameter uRSP , is indicative\nof deviations from axisymmetry. The second parameter is significantly non-zero only for\nwavelength regions near certain spectral features. Equivalently, the scatter of the continuum\ndata points about the best-fit line in Figure 3 is similar to that expected from the errors.\nThis means the SN ejecta can be approximated as having a global, axisymmetric asphericity\nwith deviations caused by a non-axisymmetric distribution of certain ionic species.\nPolarization in a SN atmosphere is induced by light scattering off of electrons. Thomson\nscattering is a wavelength-independent process, but our estimator of the total polarization,\nqRSP , shows a number of broad undulations with wavelength and a general decrease in\nthe polarization level toward the blue end of the spectrum. This is due to the nature of\nthe opacity in SNe Ia, which is dominated by a large number of bound-bound transitions,\nprimarily of iron-peak elements (Pinto & Eastman 2000). These transitions act to depolarize\nthe emergent radiation (H\u00f6flich et al. 1996), so the gradient of polarization percentage from\nred to blue reflects the increasing number of such depolarizing transitions in the blue and\nultraviolet portion of the spectrum (Howell et al. 2001). Note that this interpretation does\ndepend on our choice for the ISP, which we will revisit at the end of this section.\nThe detailed form of the undulations seen in qRSP is therefore a direct probe of the\nline opacity in the continuum-formation region of SNe Ia, as wavelengths of greater line\nopacity should show more depolarization. Inspection of plots of the expansion opacity given\nin Pinto & Eastman (2000) and Kasen (2006) shows a local maximum in the line opacity\nnear 5300 \u00c5 and a minimum near 4600 \u00c5, similar to the wavelengths of local minima and\nmaxima, respectively, in the polarization data shown in Figure 4. This correspondence may\nonly be suggestive, but can be verified by modern 3D radiative transfer calculations of the\ntype described by Kasen et al. (2006).\nThe amplitude of continuum polarization gives information about the global degree of\nasphericity of the SN atmosphere (Shapiro & Sutherland 1982; Jeffery 1991; H\u00f6flich 1991).\nSN 1999by was the first SN Ia with a firm detection of intrinsic polarization, at least 0.7%\n(Howell et al. 2001). The best-fit model of Howell et al. (2001) explained the polarization\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nas being due to an oblate ellipsoid with the major axis 17% longer than the minor axis\nand viewed nearly equator-on. Despite the sometimes large line polarizations, subsequent\nobservations of SNe Ia have yielded detections of intrinsic continuum polarization that are\nsmaller than in SN 1999by, with values of 0.3\u20130.4% being typical (Wang et al. 2003, 2006;\nLeonard et al. 2005; Chornock et al. 2006). Converting the continuum polarization to a\ngeometry is model-dependent (e.g., H\u00f6flich 1991), but the lower polarizations of most SNe Ia\nmay be due to objects with asphericities closer to 10% (Wang et al. 2003). SN 2004S is no\nexception, with a minimum of 0.4% intrinsic continuum polarization.\nThe polarization angle rotations described above in line features of Si II, Ca II, and Fe II\nare evidence that the geometric distribution of these ionic species within the ejecta differs\nfrom the geometry of the continuum-emitting SN atmosphere. The pure ellipsoidal models\nof SN 1999by explored by Howell et al. (2001) had only radial variations in composition, but\nthey were able to successfully model the spectropolarimetric feature associated with Si II\npresent in their data. The additional opacity present in the strong line relative to nearby\nwavelengths resulted in additional depolarization at a constant polarization angle. Such a\nmodel for SN 2004S could possibly explain the dip in qRSP seen in our data centered on the\nSi II line, but not the feature in uRSP . In particular, the loop in the q \u2212 u plane for the\nfeature associated with the Ca II NIR triplet cannot be formed in a simple axisymmetric\nmodel for the ejecta.\nThe HV material in SN 2001el also showed such a q \u2212 u loop (Wang et al. 2003;\nKasen et al. 2003). Kasen et al. (2003) explored several different geometries for the HV\nejecta and found that q \u2212 u loops were a generic consequence of systems whose components\nhad different axes of symmetry. For example, they found that an ellipsoidal shell whose axis\nof symmetry was misaligned with respect to an ellipsoidal continuum region produced such a\nloop. They also found that models invoking clumps in the ejecta could produce q \u2212 u loops.\nClumps can produce polarimetric signatures by selectively blocking and depolarizing part\nof the light from the underlying polarized continuum. These clumps might not be oriented\nalong the symmetry axis of the system, and hence produce polarimetric angle rotations.\nIn SN 2004S, however, the main line-polarization features are being formed at photospheric velocities. This can be seen most clearly in the Si II panels of Figure 6. While\nmodulations of the polarization exist at all wavelengths, the wavelength bins with the greatest polarization deviations from that of the continuum are located just blueward of the\nP-Cygni absorption minimum. The main source of polarization could be clumps of Si IIabsorbing material selectively blocking portions of the polarized photosphere and confined\nrather narrowly in velocity space above the photospheric velocity. Support for this picture\ncomes from the two separate polarimetric features seen in the Ca II NIR triplet. Explana-\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ntions for the line polarization must prevent the polarization feature associated with \u03bb8662\nfrom blending with the polarization feature formed by \u03bb\u03bb8498, 8542, just 4000 km s\u22121 to\nthe blue. Depolarizing clumps in the ejecta confined to velocities less than \u223c13,000 km s\u22121\ncould be responsible.\nLeonard et al. (2005) described spectropolarimetric angle rotations in line features of\nSi II and Ca II in SN 2003du that are at least broadly similar to these results. They ascribed\nthe rotations to either clumps in the ejecta or ionization asymmetries of the sort invoked by\nChugai (1992) to explain observations of SN 1987A. Clumps of radioactive 56 Ni formed in\nthe explosion could produce local variations in ionization and electron density that would\nbe manifested as polarization features. In addition, Wang et al. (2003) describe a potential\n\"skin effect\" as 56 Ni clumps produce a tangential component to the radiation field whose\neffects would vary as a function of wavelength due to the wavelength dependence of the\nphotospheric radius. However, any clumps of 56 Ni would only have a modest effect on the\nionization state of SN Ia ejecta and the significant path length of gamma rays in the ejecta\nwould tend to smooth out the effects of clumpy energy deposition from radioactive elements.\nTherefore, we do not favor the interpretation where polarimetric effects are directly due\nto the clumpy distribution of 56 Ni instead of the clumpy distribution of those ions directly\nresponsible for the polarimetric features.\nClumps of intermediate-mass elements could be detectable by other means. Thomas et al.\n(2002) examined the consequences of clumping on variation in line profiles. In their parameterized models, the observed homogeneity of Si II line profiles in SNe Ia meant that the\ncharacteristic size scale of perturbations in composition must be of order 1% of the size of\nphotosphere or smaller. Larger perturbations would result in variations of the line profile\nwhen observed from different orientations that are larger than the observed variation in normal SNe Ia, though we note that in this particular object the Si II line is somewhat weaker\nthan normal (\u00a73.1; Krisciunas et al. 2007). A single clump in front of the SN photosphere\ncan result in large observed polarizations (Kasen et al. 2003), so perhaps the small value of\nthe polarization modulations in the lines is a result of many small clumps, consistent with\nthe Thomas et al. (2002) results. Future numerical work will make possible quantitative\ncalculations of the effects of clumps of different size scales on the polarization spectrum\n(Kasen et al. 2006).\nNext we turn our attention to the HV lines. The evidence presented above shows that\nthe line-polarization features in SN 2004S are associated with material near the photospheric\nvelocity, not the HV line-forming region. A small polarization modulation is visible in uRSP\nin the blue wing of the HV Ca II NIR triplet feature. A formal integration over 7875\u20138075\n\u00c5 (blueshifts of 17,000\u201324,000 km s\u22121 relative to \u03bb8542) gives a non-zero measurement of\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nuRSP = 0.103\u00b1 0.025%, which is significantly smaller than the photospheric feature. Naively,\nthis is somewhat unexpected as SNe 2001el, 2002bf, and 2004dt all showed strong (0.7%\n< P < 2.5%) polarization features in their HV features (Wang et al. 2003; Leonard et al.\n2005; Wang et al. 2006). The answer may be that we caught SN 2004S at a special epoch,\nwhen the HV material had sufficient optical depth (or a large enough photospheric covering\nfraction) to imprint an absorption feature on the spectrum, but not enough to result in a\nsignificant polarization feature.\nThe time series of spectropolarimetry presented in Wang et al. (2003) showed that the\nHV polarization feature in SN 2001el was strong at early times and disappeared after maximum light as the feature in the flux spectrum also faded. Our data are most closely comparable in time to their 2001 October 9 epoch (+10 d after maximum light), in which\nthe HV flux feature was still present, but fading, and the polarization feature was mostly\ngone. SN 2003du provides another example of this phenomenon. Gerardy et al. (2004) presented spectra at early times that showed a strong HV feature, but the data analyzed by\nLeonard et al. (2005), taken 18 d after maximum light, show no HV absorption or associated\npolarization feature.\nA comparison between the polarimetry of SNe 2001el and 2004S is very interesting.\nLeonard et al. (2005) found that the spectropolarimetric properties of SNe Ia were diverse,\nbut may be correlated with the photometric and spectroscopic properties. In this case,\nKrisciunas et al. (2007) demonstrated that these two supernovae have almost identical light\ncurves and spectra, so we would like to know whether the similarities extend to the polarimetry as well. Fortuitously, our single set of spectropolarimetry is at almost the same epoch\n(+9 d) as one of the observations of SN 2001el presented by Wang et al. (2003) (+10 d),\nthough we do not have a corresponding time series of data. Wang et al. (2003) used a different method to determine the ISP (see below) so our results are not directly comparable,\nbut we can make qualitative comparisons to the data presented in their Figures 9, 10, and\n11.\nThe continuum polarization of SN 2001el has a maximum amplitude of 0.3% and it\ndecreases rather sharply by a few tenths of a percent blueward of \u223c5400 \u00c5, which is where\nSN 2004S also shows a change in continuum polarization. At earlier epochs, the Si II \u03bb6355\nline in SN 2001el shows deviations from axisymmetry in the form of a q \u2212 u loop with\nan amplitude of 0.5%, similar to what we see in our SN 2004S data, though the feature\nin SN 2001el mostly faded by +10 d to the \u223c0.1% level. Some difference in the silicon\ndistribution between the two SNe should be expected from the slightly weaker and redder\nSi II line in the flux spectrum of SN 2004S (Krisciunas et al. 2007).\nAs noted above, the HV Ca II NIR triplet polarization feature in SN 2001el largely\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\ndisappeared between maximum light and +10 d. The photospheric component of the NIR\ntriplet in SN 2001el has a few tenths of a percent polarization at +10 d, although it lacks the\ntwo separate features seen in SN 2004S. SN 2001el also shows no obvious sign of the q\u2212u loop\nat photospheric velocities apparent in the Ca II feature of SN 2004S. A polarization feature\n(0.2% in each Stokes parameter) in SN 2001el near 4800 \u00c5 on day +10 is not mentioned by\nWang et al. (2003), but appears to correspond to the features in SN 2004S which we have\nassociated with Fe II. In summary, SN 2001el has slightly less continuum polarization than\nSN 2004S and weaker line-polarization features at the epoch most comparable to our data,\nthough the Si II line in SN 2001el at earlier epochs is similar to our data for SN 2004S.\nThe interpretation of the results presented in this paper is affected by uncertainty in the\ndetermination of the ISP. Our choice of ISP has been guided by the belief that the intrinsic\npolarization at wavelengths less than 5000 \u00c5 should be minimal, as detailed by Howell et al.\n(2001). Another plausible method for estimating the ISP is to obtain observations at a\nvery late epoch, when the electron scattering optical depth should be negligible and any\nmeasured polarization can be ascribed to ISP. Wang et al. (2003) obtained such observations\nfor SN 2001el and determined a different value for the ISP than was measured from the first\nmethod (Kasen et al. 2003), with no obvious way to reconcile the two possibilities. We lack\nlate-time observations of SN 2004S, so we cannot perform this test.\nIn this work we have chosen the first ISP method due to the simplicity of interpretation\nand the lack of a compelling argument for another ISP choice, but for the rest of this section\nwe will examine the consequences of relaxing our assumptions. If we do not choose an\nISP along the main axis shown by the continuum data points in Figure 3, then the angle of\npolarization of the continuum will vary with wavelength. One possible alternative ISP would\nbe near the point (qRSP ,uRSP ) of (0.0,\u22120.3) in Figure 5, chosen to minimize the polarization\nangle rotation through the Si II line as well as the magnitude of the polarization at the\nminimum of the P-Cygni absorption, but this ISP vector creates problems of interpretation\nas well. No choice for the ISP can eliminate the q \u2212 u loop shown by the Ca II NIR triplet.\nIf we know polarization angle rotations must occur across a feature due to one intermediatemass element, then perhaps we should expect them in others as well. In addition, the\ntotal host-galaxy ISP correction would be uncomfortably large given the low host-galaxy\nreddening.\nPotential ISP vectors other than our chosen one necessarily lead to non-zero polarization\nat wavelengths below 4000 \u00c5, which would be an important result. Implicit in our discussion\nof the continuum polarization is a construction whereby continuum radiation is polarized by\nelectron scattering and then subsequently depolarized by bound-bound line-transport processes in the outer part of the SN atmosphere. This picture is backed by detailed numerical\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nsimulations of radiation transport in SNe Ia. Pauldrach et al. (1996) analyzed the 1D deflagration model W7 (Nomoto et al. 1984) and found that at maximum light the optical\ndepth to electron scattering was of order unity near a velocity of 5000 km s\u22121 . The apparent\n\"photospheric\" velocities measured from the minima of P-Cygni line features are closer to\n10,000 km s\u22121 due the effects of pseudo-continuous opacity from many weak lines of iron-peak\nelements.\nAt the later epoch of our SN 2004S observations (+9 d), the surface of optical depth\nunity to electron scattering should have receded even more deeply into the ejecta. In reality,\nthe competition between polarizing electron scattering and depolarizing lines occurs over\nan extended range of radii. The predominance of line opacity over Thomson scattering\n(Pinto & Eastman 2000) means that at wavelengths of high line opacity, the last scattering\nof photons occurs at larger radii in the ejecta (e.g., H\u00f6flich et al. 1998), which limits the\nopportunity for those photons to be subsequently scattered by electrons and polarized as\nthey exit the SN atmosphere.\nThese arguments are based on 1D properties of SN Ia simulations. Non-zero polarization\nat wavelengths of high line opacity could be a sign of clumps of 56 Ni mixed out into the\nejecta. Such clumps could result in local enhancements of ionization and hence electrons\nthat could produce polarization at larger radii than expected. Significant outward mixing\nof 56 Ni would be an interesting constraint on explosion models and would also have effects\non the photometric rise time and overall light-curve shape. Choosing an ISP vector away\nfrom the line in Figure 3 also produces a slow rotation of the continuum polarization angle\nwith wavelength that is hard to understand, though Wang et al. (2003) posit a potential\n\"skin effect\". The time dependence of the polarization effects due to these hypothetical 56 Ni\nclumps is unclear, though obviously our single epoch of observations cannot provide any\nconstraints by itself.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have presented a single epoch of high S/N spectropolarimetry of the Type Ia\nSN 2004S, which had an intrinsic continuum polarization of 0.4%. This observation adds to\na growing body of evidence that normal SNe Ia have global asphericities of order 10\u201320%.\nThe data points from the continuum are consistent with an axisymmetric geometry such as\nan ellipsoid. Polarization angle modulations across spectral features due to Si II, Ca II, and\nFe II are evidence that the distributions of some elements within the supernova ejecta differ\nfrom that of the continuum. One natural interpretation of these data is that we are seeing\nevidence for clumps of newly synthesized elements. These clumps could be a diagnostic of\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nturbulent burning during the explosion process (e.g., Gamezo et al. 2005). Previous work\nhas shown non-axisymmetric structures in HV material (Kasen et al. 2003), but here the\ndeviations from axisymmetry are present close to the photosphere.\nWe argued that the clumps in the ejecta are sufficiently narrowly confined in velocity\nspace to prevent the Ca II NIR triplet polarization features from being blended together. This\nconclusion could be tested with a time series of spectropolarimetric observations of a future\nSN Ia starting well before maximum light. At early times these clumps might be hidden\nbecause the lines are optically thick at higher velocities. As the absorption minima in the flux\nspectra recede through the ejecta, the clumps could become visible polarimetrically at later\ntimes. In particular, the spectroscopic sequence of SN 2004S presented by Krisciunas et al.\n(2007) shows that at early times the flux minimum of the Ca II NIR triplet line was at\nhigher velocity than the polarimetric features we see at this later epoch. Spectropolarimetric\ndata of the similar SN 2001el before maximum light (Wang et al. 2003) show no features at\nphotospheric velocities in the Ca II NIR triplet (which has a strong HV component), even\nthough photospheric polarimetric features are visible in the Si II \u03bb6355 line (which does not).\nA time series of spectropolarimetric data would also be useful in understanding the HV\nmaterial. SN 2004S is the first SN Ia observed polarimetrically with prominent HV features\nin the total-flux spectrum that lacked counterparts in the polarization. We argued above\nthat this was likely a consequence of the timing of our observations, as the HV polarization\nfeatures in the similar SN 2001el also disappeared a couple of weeks after maximum light\n(Wang et al. 2003). The HV material must decrease in optical depth as it expands, so\ndetermining the epoch at which its effects disappear in both the total-flux spectrum and\nthe polarization data has the potential to constrain the optical depth or covering fraction of\nthe HV material, key parameters in any model. Alternatively, we could be viewing the HV\nmaterial from a special orientation, such as along an axis of symmetry.\nThe deviations from axisymmetry in SN 2004S are responsible for subtle variations in\nthe polarization across the profiles of some spectral lines and would have been unobservable\nat lower S/N. Spectropolarimetric observations have the potential to be a powerful probe\nof SN Ia explosion models; however, quantitative conclusions will have to wait for detailed\nradiative transfer calculations of current 3D explosion models (e.g., Kasen et al. 2006). In\naddition, interpretation of the continuum observations is hampered by uncertainties in the\nremoval of ISP, even for objects like SN 2004S suffering small extinction. Progress can be\nmade with observations of a larger set of objects, preferably behind minimal dust columns.\nWe are grateful to R. J. Foley for assistance with the observations and K.

The numbers in parentheses are ages relative to B-band\nmaximum light. Some lines of polarimetric interest are labeled. The major difference between\nthe two spectra is that SN 2004S clearly shows an extra high-velocity (HV) absorption\ncomponent in both of the spectral features due to Ca II. See Figure 2 for details of these\nline features. The locations of the members of the Fe II triplet are marked at a blueshifted\nvelocity of 16,000 km s\u22121 .\n\n\ff\u03bb\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n5\n\nCa II H&K\nSN 2004S\nSN 1989B\n\nf\u03bb\n\n4\n3\n2\n\nSi II\n\n2.0\nCa II IR triplet\n\nf\u03bb\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n\u22121\nVelocity (1000 km s )\n\n10\n\nFig. 2.- Prominent absorption lines in SN 2004S (solid) and SN 1989B (dashed). The\nvelocity axis in each panel is computed relative to the gf -weighted line centroid for each\nblend (3945 \u00c5, 6355 \u00c5, and 8579 \u00c5, respectively). A separate multiplicative factor has been\napplied to the flux scale of the spectra in each panel to match the flux peaks of the two\nobjects in order to facilitate comparison of the absorption features. In SN 1989B, all three\nlines have flux minima at similar velocities (10,000\u201312,000 km s\u22121 ), while in SN 2004S an\nadditional absorption component is visible in both of the Ca II features at 18,000 km s\u22121 ,\nwell above the photospheric velocity defined by the Si II line.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\n\nu (%)\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.2\n\n0.0\n0.2\nq (%)\n\n0.4\n\nFig. 3.- Continuum polarization data for SN 2004S in the q \u2212 u plane. The data have\nbeen corrected for the Galactic component of ISP, as determined from probe stars. Each\ncircle represents a bin of width 50 observed \u00c5 selected from wavelength regions free of strong\nline polarization. See Figure 4 for the definition of these regions. The size of the circles\nis proportional to wavelength, so a gradient in polarization is evident between the shorter\nand longer wavelengths. The distribution of points is consistent with a single dominant axis\nof symmetry for the continuum. The line is a fit to the data points and the box marks a\npoint along the line chosen to represent the host-galaxy contribution to the ISP. The dotted\ncircle has a radius of the maximum expected ISP from host reddening arguments. After\nsubtracting the chosen ISP vector, the data were rotated to align the new Stokes parameter\nqRSP with the axis of symmetry represented by the line. The cross at (0.35, \u22120.2) shows the\nmedian statistical error bars of the points in the plot.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\nqRSP (%)\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n\u03b8 (rotated)\n\nuRSP (%)\n\n\u22120.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.4\n40\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\n\u221280\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n7000\n8000\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n9000\n\nFig. 4.- Spectropolarimetry of SN 2004S. The polarization data plotted here have been\ncorrected for ISP and binned to 50 observed \u00c5 per bin for display purposes. In addition, the\nStokes parameters have been rotated to a new coordinate system (qRSP , uRSP ), as described\nin the text. The total-flux spectrum is plotted in the background of the top panel to guide\nthe eye. Rotations due to line features of Fe II, Si II, and Ca II are visible in uRSP and \u03b8. The\nhorizontal lines overplotted in the middle panel represent sections of the spectrum that are\nfree from strong line polarization features and are used to define \"continuum\" polarization\ndata points in Figures 3 and 5. Note that the angle is ill-defined for wavelengths less than\n4200 \u00c5 due to the polarization data points being close to the origin of this coordinate system.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\nuRSP (%)\n\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\nSi II \u03bb6355\n\nFe II \u03bb\u03bb4924,5018\n\nCa II \u03bb\u03bb8498,8542\n\nCa II \u03bb8662\n\nuRSP (%)\n\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\nqRSP (%)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\nqRSP (%)\n\nFig. 5.- Polarization of various spectral features in the q \u2212 u plane. The gray circles in the\nbackground of each panel represent the same wavelength bins from the continuum windows\nmarked on Figure 4 and shown in Figure 3, but rotated to the new coordinate system. The\ncontinuum points are clearly extended along a single line in the q \u2212 u plane, indicative of a\nsingle axis of symmetry. The points representing wavelength bins associated with spectral\nfeatures due to each ion (shown in black with error bars) fall outside the spread of continuum\npoints, implying that the lines do not have the same spatial distribution as the continuum.\nThe Si II and Fe II features show similar polarization behavior that may reflect a common\nspatial origin. The Ca II data points are inconsistent with a simple single-axis symmetry\nbecause they show a spread in both qRSP and uRSP . The feature associated with Ca II\n\u03bb\u03bb8498, 8542 appears to form a loop in the q \u2212 u plane.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nuRSP (%)\n\nqRSP (%)\n\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n6000\n6400\n6800 4500\n5000\n\nHV\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\u22120.1\n0.4\n\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n8000 8400 8800\n\nHV\n\nPV\n\nPV\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\nSi II\n\nFe II\n\nCa II\n\n\u221220 \u221210 0\n10 20 \u221240 \u221230 \u221220 \u221210 0 \u221230 \u221220 \u221210 0\n10\nVelocity (1000 km/sec) Velocity (1000 km/sec) Velocity (1000 km/sec)\nFig. 6.- Stokes parameters versus velocity for three species. The total-flux spectrum is\noverplotted in each panel to guide the eye. The line velocities used for the coordinates are\nrelative to the gf -weighted line wavelength for each ionic blend. Si II \u03bb6355 shows a broad\npolarization depression with a superposed narrow feature, present in both qRSP and uRSP ,\nand centered at 10,000 km s\u22121 , just blueward of the photosphere. To aid in the identification\nof spectropolarimetric features, overplotted on the Fe II and Ca II panels are the expected\nwavelengths of each member of the respective triplets, blueshifted both by the photosphericvelocity (PV) and the high-velocity (HV) line-formation region for each ion. The polarimetric\nfeatures are clearly associated with the PV for both ions, except for the lack of a feature\nassociated with Fe II \u03bb5169. There are no strong polarimetric features associated with the\nHV line-formation region. See text for details.\n\n\f"}
