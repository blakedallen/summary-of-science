Introduction\nHayabusa (formerly known as MUSES-C) is a Japanese space mission designed to\ncollect a sample of surface material from the near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa (1998 SF36) and\nreturn the sample to Earth. The spacecraft was launched on 9 May 2003 and arrived at Itokawa\non 12 September 2005. After arrival, remote sensing observations were carried out for 2 months\nto select landing sites and study the asteroid itself (Saito et al., 2006; Fujiwara et al., 2006). In\nNovember 2005, Hayabusa landed on Itokawa to collect samples (Yano et al., 2006). It is\nthought that fine particles were swirled into the sampling capsule (Fujiwara et al. 2006).\nHayabusa will return to Earth in June 2010.\n\nDuring the rendezvous phase with Itokawa, Hayabusa was designed to find its position\nrelative to the asteroid autonomously using optical navigation cameras (ONC) and range data\nbased on light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology (Hashimoto et al., 2003; Kubota et al.\n2005). The ONC-T, a refractive telescope camera head, is referred to as the Asteroid Multiband\nImaging Camera (AMICA) when used for scientific observations. Prior to \"touch-and-go\nsampling,\" Itokawa was mapped by AMICA to select sampling sites free of serious obstacles\nsuch as meter-sized boulders and craters (Hirata et al. 2009; Michikami et al. 2009). Assessing\nthe performance and determining the calibration of AMICA are pivotal to the analysis of these\n\n5\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\ndata.\nThe main goal of this study is to derive the flux calibration parameters for the AMICA\nin-flight data. We describe the design of AMICA flight model (hereafter AMICA) in Section 2\nand the in-flight operations in Section 3. The performance and the calibration method are\ndetailed in Section 4. We compared the calibrated AMICA flux data with those of the\nground-based observations. We summarize the paper in Section 5.\n\nNote and Limitation\nThe current AMICA science team was reconstructed in April 2002, about one year\nbefore the launch of Hayabusa spacecraft, taking over the former AMICA team. Note that\npreflight information about the transmittance of the optics was obtained on the basis of\ndocuments and e-mails received by the handover process. Since the measurement accuracy of the\nfilter's transmittance and the other optical system was not examined, we cannot disclose the\ndigitized data for the avoidance of misunderstanding. The AMICA data user should not use the\ntransmittance in Figure 3 for the radiometric calibration. Instead, we recommend using the\nconversion factors determined by the in-flight operations (see Table 9). In addition, we do not\ndeal here with wide-band because it was installed for the engineering purpose (not for the\nscientific purpose).\n\n6\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n2. AMICA Design\n\nAMICA is one of the optical navigation cameras (ONC) comprised of three units: three\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) camera heads (ONC-T, ONC-W1, and ONC-W2), an analog\nsignal processing unit (ONC-AE), and a digital signal processing unit (ONC-E). AMICA\n(ONC-T) and two wide-angle navigation cameras (ONC-W1 and ONC-W2) are controlled\nthrough ONC-E and ONC-AE, and the signals obtained are converted from analog to digital in\nONC-AE. The digitized images are numerically processed by the ONC-E. The design of the\nAMICA camera head flight model is essentially the same as that of its prototype model\n(Nakamura et al., 2002). It is a CCD camera with a refractor telescope consisting of cosmic\nradiation-resistant and antireflection-coated lenses. The CCD device was configured in a\nframe-transfer architecture with an image area and a frame storage area. The depth of field (the\ndistance between the camera and objects that are observed in focus) was designed to be 75 m - !.\nAMICA was installed in the bottom panel of the spacecraft, with its optical axis boresighted with\nthose of the near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS, Abe et al. 2006a, 2007) and the LIDAR (Mukai et\nal., 2002, 2006; Abe et al., 2006b) (Fig. 1). A cylindrical stray light baffle, attached in front of\nAMICA, reduced light from sources outside the field-of-view (FOV). Because AMICA was\n\n7\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\ninstalled close to the asteroid-sampling device, it was essential to obtain calibration data before\ntouchdown, to avoid the significant degradation by contaminants associated with surface\nsampling. Table 1 summarizes the AMICA specifications.\n\n[Figure 1]\n\n[Table 1]\n\nThe effective FOV was 5.83\u00b0!5.69\u00b0, which is covered by 1024!1000 pixels, so that the\ninstantaneous FOV (IFOV) corresponded to 20.490\"/pixel. This pixel resolution corresponds to\n~70 cm from Itokawa's surface at home position (nominal distance of 7 km from Itokawa's\nsurface). The data for each image were stored in a 1024x1024 array, with two 12-column-wide\nmasked areas on the right and left edges of the array to monitor the zero-signal level (Fig. 2). The\nadopted CCD was a back-illuminated Multi-Pinned Phase (MPP)-type. This type of CCD has\ntwo main advantages: the dark current is lower than that of non-MPP type CCDs, and it has a\n\n8\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nhighly uniform subpixel scale response. The inflight temperature of the CCD (between -18 and\n-30oC) was low enough such that there was no appreciable dark as a function of integration time.\nThe subpixel response uniformity made geometric and photometric calibrations from stellar\nobservations simpler (see subpixel nonuniformities of NEAR/MSI, Murchie et al., 1999).\n\n[Figure 2]\n\nThe exposure time was controlled electronically. AMICA has no mechanical shutter.\nWe can designate any of 30 different exposure times, ranging from 5.44 ms to 178 s, plus a\nzero-second exposure (more precisely, less than 1 \u03bcs). The wide exposure time is required to\nimage both the bright asteroid and the dim stars.\n\nThe ONC-E enables numerical operations from data in up to 16-frame buffers from\nmultiple images in arbitrary combinations. In a nominal imaging sequence, we took a pair of\n\n9\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nimages in a short time interval (typically 15 s) and then used the ONC-E to subtract the latter\nframe (smear frame, 0-s exposure) from the former frame (\" 5.44-ms exposure). This procedure\nsimultaneously corrected for smear, dark current, and bias. We assumed the dark current was\nconstant during the time interval between the two exposures. To reduce the total amount of data\ndownlinked to Earth stations, we occasionally performed binning, extraction of partial areas of\ninterest, and reversible or irreversible data compressions before sending the data to the onboard\ndata recorder from the ONC-E buffer. Binning mode generated the 'average' of pixel values\nwithin the boxed area.\n\nAMICA has an eight-filter system, seven of which are compatible with the Eight Color\nAsteroid Survey (ECAS), the standard for ground-based asteroid taxonomy (Zellner et al., 1985).\nThe ECAS comprehensive database is available via the Internet on the NASA Planetary Data\nSystem (PDS) server (http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov). In addition, a neutral density (ND) filter was\nattached because the target was changed from a low-albedo asteroid to a high-albedo asteroid.\nThe original mission target was 4660 Nereus (whose albedo was considered to be 0.05, Ishibashi\net al. 2000). Due to scheduling delays, the mission target was changed twice, to 1989 ML and\nthen to Itokawa (Yoshikawa et al. 2000). The large discrepancy in albedo between Nereus and\nItokawa caused us modify the optical transmittance. The transmittance of the ND filter is 3.7% at\n\n10\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n550 nm. The transmittance of each of the seven filters, the ND filter, and the other optics were\nmeasured in a pre-flight standalone experiment. The effective wavelengths of AMICA's seven\nband filters were computed as follows:\n\n\"eff =\n\n$ \"# (\")S(\")d\"\n$ # ( \" ) d\" $ S ( \" ) d\"\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n!\nwhere !(\") = TFIL(\") x TND4%(\") x TOPT(\") x QE(\") is the system spectral efficiency; TFIL(\"),\nTND4%(\") and TOPT(\") are the transmissions of each of the seven filters, the ND filter, and the\nother optical systems, respectively, measured in pre-flight standalone experiments; QE(\") is the\nnominal quantum efficiency of the CCD provided by the manufacturer; and S(\") represents the\nspectrum of the light source. The effective wavelengths were calculated for sunlight, and the\nresult is shown in Table 2. AMICA's effective wavelengths were within ~10 nm of standard\nECAS in the b-, v-, w-, x- and p-bands, but diverged from the standard ECAS (Tedesco et al,\n1982) in the ul- and zs-bands. An additional wide-band (clear) filter was installed in the filter\nwheel for faint-object detection (e.g., satellite survey, Fuse et al., 2007), and four polarizers were\nattached to the upper left edge of the CCD chip (Fig. 2). Figure 3 provides the AMICA filter\ntransmittance and the system spectral efficiency. The ul-filter exhibited a weak leak at longer\n\n11\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nwavelengths (> 830 nm) and the intensity contribution of solar-colored objects was estimated to\nincrease the signal by 1.4% over the signal in the designed wavelength (310\u2013410 nm). Table 2\ncompares the effective wavelengths and widths of the AMICA filters to those of the ECAS\nstandard system (Tedesco et al, 1982).\n\n[Figure 3]\n\n[Table 2]\n\nFigure 4 shows a front view of AMICA. The large cylinder at the center of the image is\nthe filter wheel casing, and the small cylinder at the bottom is the entrance to the optics. The two\nprotrusions located in front of the optics are small lamps that irradiate the optics. They are\nreferred to as FF-lamps, and are used for degradation monitoring in sensitivity degradation (see\nSection 4.2.2).\n\n12\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n[Figure 4]\n\n3. AMICA Operation Summary\n\nThe in-flight operation phases are conventionally referred to as the Initial Operation\nPhase (IOP), Cruise Phase (CP), Approach Phase (AP), and Mission Phase (MP). In this section,\nwe summarize the AMICA operations during each phase.\n\nDuring the IOP, instrument functioning was tested. Following launch on 9 May 2003,\nwe checked the device functioning. AMICA took FF-lamp images to investigate whether any\ncontamination had adhered to the camera. On 23 May 2003, we took stellar images of the area\naround the head of Scorpius.\n\nThe CP was the period during which the spacecraft was driven by the ion engine. We\nobserved stars during breaks in ion engine operation. \" Sco was imaged again on 1 June 2004 to\nmonitor the degradation in sensitivity because \" Sco is not likely to be a variable star. The\nHayabusa spacecraft encountered Earth on 19 May 2004, receiving a gravity assist toward\n\n13\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nItokawa's orbit. During the Earth swing-by, we took a sequence of Earth and Moon images. On\n26 April 2005, we imaged a portion of sky in Taurus with the wide-band filter for geometric\ncalibration. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the images with the other seven filters for the\ngeometric calibration because of the limited observation time.\n\nDuring the AP, the spacecraft approached Itokawa using chemical engines, approaching\nto within ~10,000 km of Itokawa. On 22 August 2005, we obtained the first image of Itokawa\nfrom AMICA. After that, we observed brightness variations in Itokawa for comparison with\nground-based lightcurves. On 29 August, # Leo was included in images of Itokawa. On 1\nSeptember, Itokawa's Hill Sphere was surveyed for possible satellites through the wide-band\nfilter (Fuse et al., 2007). The Hayabusa spacecraft arrived at Itokawa at 01:00 UTC, 12\nSeptember 2005.\n\nDuring the MP, the spacecraft did not orbit Itokawa, but remained in a station-keeping\nheliocentric orbit. Hayabusa initially observed the asteroid's surface from a distance of ~20 km\nin the Gate Position (GP), a region roughly on a line connecting Earth to the asteroid on the\nsunward side. Global color mapping (Ishiguro et al., 2007) and shape modeling (Demura et al.,\n2006; Gaskell et al., 2008) were also performed. On 27 September, a polarimetric observation\n\n14\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nwas conducted at a 10\u00b0 phase angle. Higher-resolution imaging was performed from a distance\nof about 7 km (Home Position, hereafter HP). AMICA covered the whole surface of Itokawa in\nboth the GP and HP. On 3 October 2005, Hayabusa lost the use of the YSC-axis reaction wheel\n(see Fig. 1), and thereafter used one reaction wheel and two chemical thrusters to maintain\nattitude control. This malfunction made it difficult to obtain polarimetric data at larger solar\nphase angles, and the Hayabusa project team decided to cancel the high solar phase angle\nobservations (~90\u00b0). These were replaced by Tour observations, in which the spacecraft moved\nto various attitudes and solar phase angles (Sun-Itokawa-AMICA angle, <35\u00b0) to access the\npolar region and make high-resolution topographic images under different lighting conditions\n(Fujiwara et al., 2006). Using the observations in the GP, HP, and Tour sub-phases, a surface\nsampling location on a smooth area called Muses-C Regio was selected.\n\nDuring the MP, the spacecraft moved close to the surface on 4 and 12 November for\ntouchdown rehearsals. First and second touchdowns were made on 19 and 25 November. During\nthe descending and ascending periods, AMICA took close-up images of Itokawa (Yano et al.\n2006; Miyamoto et al. 2007; Nakamura et al. 2007; Noguchi et al. 2009). In addition, AMICA\nobtained a set of stellar images and FF-lamp images for the purpose of the calibration.\n\n15\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n4. Inflight calibrations\n\nAMICA raw data (Level 1) are archived on the Internet servers at ISAS\n(http://darts.isas.jaxa.jp/planet/hayabusa/), and will be archived by the NASA/Planetary Data\nSystem (PDS, http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/). All calibration data obtained during in-flight operation\nare summarized in Table 3. In this section, we review AMICA performance based on these data\nsets.\n\n[Table 3]\n\n4-1. Geometric calibrations\n\n4-1-1. Co-alignment with NIRS and LIDAR\n\nThe optical axis of AMICA was designed to be boresighted with NIRS and LIDAR.\nAccurate knowledge of the NIRS and LIDAR pointing directions in AMICA coordinates was\nrequired to extend the NIRS spectral range to the visible wavelength using the AMICA filter set,\n\n16\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nand improve the measurement accuracy of the distance between the spacecraft and the LIDAR\nfootprint. The AMICA NIR bands were essential to characterize the mafic absorption band\naround 1 \u03bcm because in conjunction with the NIRS (Abe et al., 2005, 2006a). Since the w-band\nwas designed to match the peak of the continuum for an S-type asteroids (Tedesco et al., 1982),\nAMICA complemented the spectrum of the shorter wavelength of NIRS. Knowing the distance\nto the LIDAR footprint improved the knowledge of the position of the Hayabusa spacecraft\nrelative to Itokawa's mass center, using AMICA data, LIDAR measurements, and the Itokawa\nshape model (Gaskell et al., 2008; Abe et al., 2006b).\n\nWe attempted to observe # Sco with both AMICA and NIRS in the IOP. During the\nlong (134-s) AMICA exposure, a portion of sky in the vicinity of # Sco was scanned with NIRS\nto check its geometric calibration. The boresight of NIRS was centered on pixel (493, 510) in the\nAMICA frame. The alignment between NIRS and LIDAR was adjusted as accurately as possible\non the ground prior to the launch. Because LIDAR (a 0.04\u00b0x0.97\u00b0 ellipse) spectra reflected by\nItokawa were detected by NIRS (0.1\u00b0x 0.1\u00b0 squared), the alignment accuracy was better than the\nfield-of-view of NIRS, i.e., ~0.1\u00b0 (Abe et al. 2006b).\n\n17\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n4-1-2. Focal length and distortion\n\nWide-band images of a portion of sky in Taurus were analyzed to determine the focal\nlength f (mm) and distortion (parameterized by K1). A long-exposure image (178 s) was taken on\n26 April 2005. Due to limited observation time, we could not acquire long-exposure images\nusing the other seven filters. In this image, we identified 69 stars listed in the Hipparcos and\nTycho catalogs, with negligibly small position errors. The position of each star in AMICA\ncoordinates (H(i),V(i)) was obtained by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian function. The position\naccuracy, which depends on the ratio of the star signal to the background noise, was equivalent\nto 0.1\u20130.3 pixels.\n\nThe position of the i-th star in the catalogs (#(i),$(i)) can be converted into AMICA CCD\ncoordinates (X(i)star, Y(i)star) in mm as follows:\n\n(i) %\n\" X star\nL\n$ (i) ' = C PIX\n( PIX\n# Ystar &\n\n\"\n%\ncos + (i) sin(, (i) * , 0 )\n*\n$\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\n\" cos) *sin ) % cos+ cos+ cos(, * , ) + sin + sin + '\n0\n0\n0\n' ,\n$\n'$\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nsin\n+\ncos\n+\ncos(\n,\n*\n,\n)\n*\ncos\n+\n# sin ) cos) & $ *\n0\n0\n0 sin + '\n$\n(i)\n(i)\n(i) '\n# cos+0 cos+ cos(, * , 0 ) + sin +0 sin + &\n\n!\n\n18\n\n(2)\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nwhere C = 648000/$ arcsec; #0 and $0 are the right ascension and declination of the center of the\nAMICA image (H=512, V=512) in zero-based coordinates; and % is the angle of rotation around\nthe optical axis of AMICA using the right-hand rule. We assumed the optical axis of AMICA\nwas co-incident with the center of the AMICA image and perpendicular to the CCD plane. %PIX\nand LPIX (=1.2x10-2 mm pixel-1) are the pixel angular resolution in arcsec pixel-1 and the size of a\npixel in mm pixel-1, respectively. The distortion parameter K1 follows the scheme of Davies et al.\n(1994) and Klaasen et al. (1997), as follows:\n\n# x (i) = LPIX (H (i) \" 512)\n$ (i)\n(i)\n% y = LPIX (V \" 512)\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\n(3)\n\nR(i)2 = x (i)2 + y (i)2\n\n\" xC(i) = x (i) (1+ K1R(i)2 )\n,\n# (i)\n(i)\n(i)2\n$ yC = y (1+ K1R )\n\nwhere x(i)C and y(i)C are the observed star offsets from the image center, corrected for radial\ndistortion. The observed stellar positions (x(i)C, y(i)C) in the focal plane were compared with those\nof catalog stars (X(i)star, Y(i)star) in Eq. (2). A least-squares algorithm was solved for pixel size,\ncamera orientation, and the distortion coefficient. The results are summarized in Table 4. The\n\n19\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nbest-fit focal length was 120.71 \u00b1 0.03 mm and the best-fit distortion coefficient K1 was\n\u20132.8x10-5 mm-2. The mean residual for the best solution was 3.6x10\u20133 mm, or 0.3 pixels. When\nwe ignored the distortion term (i.e. K1=0 in Eq. (3)), the resulting pixel scale was 20.490 \u00b1 0.005\narcsec and the effective focal length was 120.80 \u00b1 0.03 mm. The resultant focal length was\nslightly longer than the designed value of 120 mm, but consistent with results obtained from\npre-launch laboratory data (~120.6 mm).\n\n[Table 4]\n\nNote that the focal length and distortion were examined in only wide-band filter. The\nmain engine of the spacecraft, ion engine had always disturbed the attitude of the spacecraft,\nwhich made us difficult to take images during MP. As the result, we could not examine the\ndistortion and the focal length in the other seven filters.\n\n4-1-3. Alignment to the spacecraft\n\nHere we examine the alignment of AMICA with respect to the spacecraft. We used the\nresults of star identification in nine images from the 2005 August and 2005 September runs to\n\n20\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nderive the relative alignment of the boresight of AMICA to the spacecraft. The rotation angles\nwere estimated to adjust the observed position of stars to those of catalog stars. A set of rotation\nangles about the X- and Y-axes and a rotation angle about the Z-axis, which is identical to % in\nEq. (2), were adjusted separately but iteratively. The root-mean square (RMS) residual errors of\nthe star positions in a single image were less than 0.51 pixels or 0.003\u00b0. The best estimates of the\nrotation angles from the AMICA coordinate to the spacecraft coordinate were -0.124\u00b0 \u00b1 0.011\u00b0,\n-0.087\u00b0 \u00b1 0.005\u00b0, and 0.380\u00b0 \u00b1 0.015\u00b0 about the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, respectively. The estimated\nalignment includes errors from the spacecraft attitude determination, expected to be below 0.02\u00b0.\nBecause the discrepancies among individual results from each star image are comparable to the\nuncertainty in spacecraft attitude, we conclude that most of the alignment errors arise from the\nuncertainty in spacecraft attitude measurements. All of the geometric information will be made\navailable as a NAIF/SPICE (spacecraft position, planet/satellite position, instrument alignment,\ncamera/scan platform instrument and spacecraft pointing, and events) instrumental kernel (Acton,\n1996) in both the ISAS and PDS archives.\n\n4-2. Radiometric calibrations\n\n21\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nIn this section, we describe the processes used to remove the instrumental effects and\nconvert the observed raw Digital Numbers (DNs) into radiance units using mainly in-flight test\ndata. The number of photons detected by AMICA CCD is converted to the number of electrons\nby the photon gain and the electrons are converted to DN by the electronic gain (17 e-/DN for\nAMICA). Figure 5 provides a schematic illustration of the AMICA calibration pipeline. The\npipeline converts raw DN unit into the physical units. As described below, we deduced the\nconversion factor in radiance units for v-band and the conversion factor in reflectance for ul-, b-,\nv-, w-, x-, p-, and zs-bands based on the inflight data (see Note and Limitation in Section 1.\nIntroduction)\n\n[Figure 5]\n\n4-2-1. Bias and Dark Subtraction\n\nThe optical sky background signal level is a combination of an electronic offset that\ndefines the \"zero\" level of the analog-to-digital converter (bias) and any additional signal due to\n\n22\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nthermal electrons (i.e., dark current). Because AMICA comprises two different areas (the\nimaging section and the store section), the dark current is the sum of these two components. A\npre-flight dark current model was developed by fitting empirical forms using data from dark\nframes taken at multiple temperatures (-30 ~ +40\u00b0C). The dark current accumulation rate Id,IM\n(H,V,TCCD) [DN s-1] for each pixel can be expressed as follows:\n\nId, IM ( H,V,TCCD ) = d0,IM ( H,V ) exp[ d1,IM ( H,V )TCCD ],\n\n\" 30 # TCCD # +40 ,\n\n(4)\n\n!\n\nwhere d0, IM and d 1, IM are dark model parameters in the image section. Figure 6(a) shows the\nCCD temperature dependence of average dark current of all unmasked pixels (1000 columns x\n1024 rows). To derive the dark current model in the store section, we use 1-\u03bcs exposure dark\nimages. Because the readout time depends on CCD position (16 ms at (H,V)=(0,0) and 391 ms at\n(1024,1024)), the dark current in the store section generated a smooth brightness gradient across\nthe 1-\u03bcs exposure frames. By fitting this gradient, we obtained the average value of dark\naccumulation rate in the store section as follows:\n\nId, ST (TCCD ) = d0,ST exp( d1,ST TCCD ),\n\n\" 30 # TCCD # +40\n\n!\n23\n\n(5)\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nwhere d0, ST and d 1, ST are dark model parameters in the store section. In Table 5, we summarize\nthe pre-flight dark model parameters for average Id,IM(TCCD) and Id,ST (TCCD).\n\n[Figure 6a]\n[Figure 6b]\n\n[Table 5]\n\nAfter launch, we could not update our dark model using in-flight data because the CCD\ntemperature was too low to detect dark current. Figure 7 shows the history of TCCD after the\nlaunch. It was kept between -18\u00b0C (the descending and ascending period) and \u201330\u00b0C. Using Eq.\n(4) and (5), the dark accumulation rate averaged over the frame was estimated to be 0.16 and\n0.15\n\n[DN s-1] at TCCD = -18\u00b0C and TCCD = -30\u00b0C, respectively. Therefore, any in-flight dark\n\ncurrent was buried in the readout noise (60e- or ~4DN for AMICA). In the Itokawa observations,\nthe exposure time was <<1 s, while Itokawa's intensity was 1000\u20133000 DN. Therefore, we\nconclude that dark current was negligible in the Itokawa images.\n\n24\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n[Figure 7]\n\nDuring flight, the CCD was exposed to severe radiation, and the damage from\ncosmic-ray irradiation resulted in an increase in the number of pixels with a larger than normal\ndark current, or \"hot\" pixels (Sirianni et al., 2005). Figure 8 shows a histogram of dark sky taken\non 22 May 2003, 13 January 2004 and 22 August 2005. The histogram shows that the number of\nhot pixels increased during the mission. These hot pixels make accurate measurements of\nintensities of faint objects (e.g., stars) difficult. Hot pixels were also observed in the Itokawa\nimages using less-sensitive filters (ul and zs-bands). We identified hot pixels using the optical\nnavigation images taken during the AP and subtracting them from the Itokawa images in which\nthe dark signal was large (i.e., IDARK(H,V) ! tEXP > 30 DN). For reference, Table 6 shows the\npositions and dark currents of the top five hot pixels.\n\n[Figure 8]\n\n[Table 6]\n\n25\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nHere we investigated the background zero level (i.e. bias). The bias level generally\ndepends on the electronics temperature (Bell et al. 2003, 2006) and CCD temperature. From\npre-flight standalone experiments, we found empirically that the bias level increased when the\nanalog electronics (ONC-AE) temperature decreased. However, we could not establish the bias\nmodel as a function of temperature because ONC-AE was not equipped with a temperature\nsensor. Figure 9 shows the bias level history, obtained from blank sky data. It is clear that the\nbias level showed secular variation, and thus we fit the bias level as a function of time, as\nfollows:\n\nIBIAS ( DAY ) = B0 + B1DAY + B2 DAY 2 ,\n\n(6)\n\n!\n\nwhere DAY is the number of days after the launch, and B0, B1, and B2 are in-flight bias model\nparameters. The best-fit parameters are given in Table 7. Reproducible error in the bias level was\n# 5 DN (1&). We emphasize that the bias uncertainty can be corrected eventually in most of the\n\n26\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nItokawa frames by adjusting the sky level to zero DN, because almost all Itokawa images (except\nclose-up images) include the dark sky area.\n\n[Figure 9]\n\n[Table 7]\n\n4-2-2. Response Uniformity and Temporal Variation\n\nFlat-field images in all bands were acquired on the ground to correct pixel-to-pixel\nvariation in CCD response and vignetting (reduction of image brightness at the periphery\ncompared to the center). Standalone flat-field data were obtained twice in each filter using an\nintegrating sphere at NEC Toshiba Space Systems Ltd. (NT Space) at room temperature (around\n30\u00b0C). AMICA was pointed into the integrating sphere to acquire images of a field known to be\nspatially uniform to an accuracy of ~2%. A low spatial frequency responsivity variation with\namplitudes of 4% was found, as well as pixel-to-pixel responsivity variation with amplitudes of\n\n27\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n0.5% or less and 1\u201310 pixel-scale dark spots. The low spatial frequency component can be\ninterpreted as vignetting: a decrease in detected image intensity with increasing distance from the\nimage center. The highest spatial frequency (pixel-to-pixel) components represent nonuniformity\nin pixel sensitivity. Dark spots with several-pixel scale are attributed to dust on the light path or\ndefective pixels. In addition, we found a doughnut-shaped pattern in the NT Space integrating\nsphere of amplitude 3% or less (Fig. 10). We considered that the doughnut-shaped pattern was\ncaused by the dark spot in the integrating sphere. Because the uneven pattern appeared at\ndifferent CCD positions in each test, we masked the pattern and added two images, excluding the\nmasked region. Furthermore, we developed a small integrating sphere, which could be used in\nthe synthesis test (Sogame et al. 2005). The spatial uniformity of the small integrating sphere\nmatched the former integrating sphere to an accuracy of 1%, except the doughnut-shaped pattern.\nWe obtained flat images of the portable integrating sphere in w- and p-band filters during a\nfunctional test of the spacecraft. The archived flat-field images are derived from the NT Space\nintegrating sphere data for ul-, b-, v-, x-, zs-, and wide-band filters, and from the portable\nintegrating sphere for w- and p-band filters.\n\n[Figure 10]\n\n28\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nPost-launch, no photometrically flat objects were available in space to use in assessing\nongoing variation in the flat-field calibration. To check the temporal variation in responsivity,\ntwo small lamps (commonly called FF-lamp A and B) were attached in front of the objective on\nAMICA (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). By activating these FF-lamps in high- or low-voltage mode, we\nobtained images of defocused light to check the camera conditions. Figures 11(a) and (b) are\nw-band images taken by the integrating sphere and FF-lamps. All of the dark spots in the\nflat-field image in Figure 11(a) appeared in the FF-lamps image shown in Figure 11(b), although\ndifferences in shapes and absorption rates are apparent. In the FF-lamps images, we found\ntwinned dark spots aligned on the lines parallel to the FF-lamp A and B line connection; these\nspots are not visible in the pre-flight flat-field images. Although their cause has not been\nextensively investigated, they are probably of FF-lamp origin.\nFigures 11(c) and (d) are FF-lamp images taken during in-flight operations. We show\nFigures 11(c)\u2013(e) to trace the time variation in the FF-lamp image data. Figure 11(e) is the ratio\nof (c) to (b), and Fig. 11(f) is the ration of (d) to (c). Each contour level corresponds to a 1%\nvariation. In Figure 11(e), intensities of some pixels varied by up to \u00b13% due to temporal\nvariation in the twinned spots. The change can be explained by the attachment and removal of\n\n29\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\ndust particles or the evaporation of contaminants during the launch phase. The variation in\nFF-lamp images do not necessarily indicate that the flat-fielding varied by up to 3% because the\ntwinned spots were not obvious in the flat-field image. Many circular spots were generated in the\nCP (see Fig. 11(f)), but the variation in intensity was ' 1%. FF-lamp images were obtained\nduring the MP. However, one of the FF-lamps did not turn on because of a breakdown. Further\ncomparative studies would be needed to convert the FF-lamp images into a flat-field image if\none consider the pixel-to-pixel responsivity less than ~3%. AMICA data users should pay\nparticular attention to pixel values around (380, 450), (390, 510), (730, 390), (830, 920), and\n(850, 510), where temporal variation in the FF-lamp images are larger than 2% (Fig. 11(e)).\n\n[Figure 11]\n\nThe lamps had high- and low-voltage modes; we used the low-voltage mode for the\nlonger wavelength bands (x, p, zs) to avoid saturation. Figure 12 shows the temporal variation in\nthe raw AMICA output (average in the H = 462-561 and V = 462-561 square) during both the\nCP and MP. The x-, p-, and zs-band data output (dashed lines in Fig. 12) exhibited large\n\n30\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nvariation, possibly attributable to the instability of lamp brightness in the low-voltage mode. In\ncontrast, the ul-, b-, v-, and w-band data showed little variation (solid lines in Fig. 12). Applying\nthe smear correction, the mean intensity of the v- and w-band showed no change to an accuracy\nof 1%, but the mean values of the b-band decreased slightly (~3%). This tendency met\nmanufacturer expectancy that degradation was insignificant at (>390 nm. In addition, the result\nof the degradation estimated by the FF-lamp is consistent with that calculated from observations\nof \" Sco (the responsivity in b-band was estimated to be down by ~5% by stellar photometry).\nTherefore, we conclude that the calibration factors in v-band determined by stellar observations\nduring CP are applicable to Itokawa data. We deduced the conversion factors in the other six\nchannels (ul-, b-, v-, w-, x-, p-, and zs-bands) by the observations of Itokawa itself to avoid the\neffect of degradation. Although FF-lamps were not originally designed for radiometric\ncalibration, we eventually found that they were useful in checking the degradation.\n\n[Figure 12]\n\n4-2-3. Readout Smear\n\n31\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nAs we mentioned in Section 2, AMICA is shuttered electronically. Observed images are\nexposed for the designated exposure time and the vertical charge-transfer period (tVCT =\n12\u03bcs!1024 = 12.288 ms). The finite duration of frame transfer produces a streak (readout smear)\nparallel to the direction of frame transfer (along the V-direction). The middle image in Figure\n13b shows an example image before smear subtraction. The readout smear is obvious in images\nwith exposure times shorter than ~100 \u03bcs.\nIn a nominal imaging sequence, we planned to take a pair of images over a short time\ninterval (typically 15 s) and subtract the latter frame (smear frame, 0 s exposure) from the former\nframe (\" 5.44-ms exposure) on the ONC-E. After an anomaly in the YSC\u2013reaction wheel on 2\nOctober 2005, the spacecraft attitude could not be adequately controlled, which caused a\nmismatch in pointing between Itokawa and smear image pairs (Fig. 13(a)). Because of the\npointing mismatch, this image pair subtraction technique could no longer be used to remove the\nstreaks on the observed images. As a result, the following smear model was developed and used\nto remove smear from images taken during the descending and ascending period.\nThe readout smear brightness ISMEAR(H) can be modeled from the observed images in a\nway similar to Murchie et al. (1999) and Bell et al. (2006), as follows:\n\n32\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nN V \"1\n\nISMEAR (H) =\n\n#t\n\nH=0\n\nt VCT\nIRAW (H,V ) \" ISKY (H,V )\n,\nNV\nVCT + t EXP\n\n(7)\n\n!\n\nwhere IRAW(H,V) is the intensity of the raw data taken with the designated exposure time tEXP;\nNV=1024 is the pixel number along the V-direction; and ISKY(H,V)~300 DN is the sum of the\nbias and dark current (mainly in the store section of the CCD). In the right-hand images of Figure\n13a, corrected by the smear model, the readout smear has been subtracted from the original\nimage with a residual of less than 1 DN.\n\n[Figure 13(a)]\n\n[Figure 13(b)]\n\n4-2-4. Linearity\n\nDN values stored in raw images are approximately proportional to the number of\nphotons detected in each CCD pixel during the exposure time. Linearity, the degree to which the\n\n33\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nCCD response is proportional to the incident flux, was tested during the pre-flight testing and the\nMP. The pre-flight linearity was examined by taking a spectralon plate illuminated by a halogen\nlamp at room temperature. We compared the DN values taken at different exposure times and\nfound that intensity was linear with an incident flux between 1000 DN and 3500 DN (Fig. 14).\nBy fitting the pre-flight data, we obtained the following:\n\n\"\nIoutput = Iinput\n+ L0 Iinput exp(L1Iinput ) ,\n\n(8)\n\n!\n\nwhere Iinput and Ioutput are the intensity of the spectralon and the observed intensity; & =1-5.0x10-8\nis the power index of the output signal; L0 = -4.87x10-11; and L1 = 5.09x10-3 in the second term\ncorrects the nonlinearity around the saturation limit (Iinput > 3800 DN).\n\n[Figure 14]\n\nThe in-flight linearity was investigated in the MP by imaging Itokawa through the\nv-band filter at exposure times of <1 \u03bcs (smear), 10.9 ms, 21.8 ms, 43.5 ms, 65.5 ms, 87.0 ms,\n131.0 ms and 174.0 ms. For each image in the sequence, the observed flux was measured by\n\n34\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\naveraging over 20-pixel by 20-pixel boxes centered on brighter terrain and darker terrain. The\nresults are shown in Figure 15(a). The obtained flux was linear with exposure times less than\n131.0 ms in the darker terrain, but was not linear beyond 131.0 ms in the brighter terrain. The\nobtained data were corrected for readout smear and background level, and converted into\naccumulation rates per unit of time (DN ms-1) for more precise investigations. The dark\naccumulation rate was constant to an accuracy of 0.3% when the signal level ranged between 780\nDN and 3230 DN (Fig. 15(b), 10.9- to 131-ms exposures in the darker area), and dropped by 2%\nat a signal level of 3840 DN (131-ms exposure in the brighter area in Fig. 15(b)). This result was\nconsistent with pre-flight investigations. Therefore, we applied Eq. (8) to the Itokawa linearity\ncorrection.\n\n[Figure 15(a)]\n[Figure 15(b)]\n\n4-2-5. Radiometric Responsivity\n\n35\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nDue to the finite width of the AMICA filters, calibration factors were affected by\ninstrumental system efficiency (Fig. 3) and by the spectrum of the incident light sources. The\nbest approach for determining the radiometric calibration coefficients is to use objects whose\ncolors are similar to Itokawa. Stars listed in ECAS standard star catalog meet this criterion not\nonly because their magnitudes and color indices are well known, but also because their spectra\nare similar to those of solar system objects. However, the installation of the ND filter made it\ndifficult to use ECAS standard stars with magnitudes fainter than 5.96. # Crv (F0), which was\nobserved by AMICA in the MP, is a good AMICA calibration star candidate. Because the\nmagnitude and color indices of # Crv are unknown, we are planning to observe it through ECAS\nfilters from a ground-based observatory. In this paper, we determined the calibration coefficient\nfrom DN to the radiance for v-band stellar magnitudes.\n\n[Table 8]\n\nWe observed nine stars in the AMICA v-band filter. In Table 8, we summarize the\nspectral type, observed date, and Johnson system's V-band magnitudes. In addition, we list the\nmaximum and minimum magnitude if the stars appeared in the variable star catalogs (General\ncatalogue of Variable Stars, GCVS, Samus' et al., 2002 and catalogue of suspected variable stars,\n\n36\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nKazarovets et al., 1998). Because the magnitude of # Ori changes significantly, we removed it\nfrom the reference stars list. We include variable stars other than # Ori whose amplitudes seem\nto be less than \u00b1 0.05 mag. (5%). Figure 16 shows the relationship between Johnson system's\ncatalog magnitude Vcat (error bars denote variable star amplitudes) and the AMICA instrumental\nmagnitude vinst defined as follows:\n\n#I &\nv inst = \"2.5log%% star (( ,\n$ t exp '\n\n(9)\n\n!\n\nwhere Istar is the observed v-band intensity (DN s-1 ). The v-band instrumental magnitude showed\ngood correlation with the V-band catalog magnitude and the deviations from the fit-line are\nindependent of the spectra of the observed nine stars. This result was expected, as the\ntransmittance of the AMICA v-band filter was designed to match that of the Johnson V-band\nfilter. From the linear fit, we obtained the magnitude zero point 7.55 \u00b1 0.03. To convert the\nmagnitude into flux, the absolute flux of Vega (Bohlin and Gilliland, 2004) was weighted by the\nAMICA system efficiency (Fig. 3(b)), and the effective flux of a zero-magnitude star was\ncalculated as 3.53x10-8 W m-2 \u03bcm-1 in AMICA v-band. This calculated flux is comparable to\n3.61x10-8 W m-2 \u03bcm-1 (Bessel 1979) in the Johnson V-band to the accuracy of ~2%. Applying the\n\n37\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\ncalculated values, we obtained an AMICA v-band calibration factor of (3.42 \u00b1 0.10)x10-3 [(W\nm-2 \u03bcm-1 sr-1) / (DN s-1)].\n\n[Figure 16]\n\nThe color indices of Itokawa at a phase angle (Sun-Itokawa-AMICA angle) of 21\u00b0 were\nobtained using the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope (UH88) by David J. Tholen to an\naccuracy of <1%. He could not obtain the data in z-band due to the faintness. Using his\nobservational data, it was possible to determine the conversion factor for filters other than v-band,\nto match the AMICA measurements to the ground-based observations. However, it is important\nto note that the color indices are phase angle-dependent. We used the disk-integrated Itokawa\ndata on 11 October 2005, at a solar phase angle of ~21\u00b0. By comparing the disk-integrated\nItokawa DN with ground-based data, we deduced the conversion factor from DN to reflectance\nrelative to the v-band (Table 9). Figure 17 shows the comparison between spectra taken at\ndifferent rotational phase (a) and different times of day (b). Although there are small time\nfluctuations in the AMICA spectra up to ~1%, they are eventually in excellent agreement with\n\n38\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nthose obtained by the ground-based observatories, i.e., the Palomar Observatory (<0.55\u03bcm,\nLowry et al. 200) and the Kitt Peak and IRTF observatories (Binzel et al. 2001).\n\n[Table 9]\n\n[Figure 17]\n\n4-3. Scattered Light and Point-Spread Functions (PSFs)\n\nThe point-spread function (PSF) describes the response of an imaging system to a point\nsource (see e.g. Klaasen et al. 1997). It may be affected by optical system aberrations (including\nlenses, filters and the CCD surface), and therefore the PSF is likely to be wavelength-dependent.\nWe examined the pixel-scale PSF (less than 10 pixels) using bright point sources (# Sco, ) Sco,\n\" Sco, # Aur, # Ori, ) Tau in the CP; Itokawa in the AP; and # Vir in the MP) in various\npositions on the CCD chip (0\u00b0\u20132.3\u00b0 away from the image center). Figure 18 shows the PSFs\nobtained in the AP as well as the CP. The object centers are computed by fitting a Gaussian to\nthe marginal profiles in x and y using non-linear least-squares techniques. The PSFs were\n\n39\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nindependent of CCD chip position and observation time, but showed a weak dependency on filter\ntype.\n\n[Figure 18]\n\nIn addition to the pixel-scale PSF, a low-intensity light component was observed in\nimages of the Moon and Itokawa in which the PSF extent was greater than 10 pixels. During the\nEarth swing-by in May 2004, we found a dim halo around the Moon. This feature was observed\nmost clearly next to bright light sources, and as discussed in previous studies (e.g., Gaddis et al.,\n1995; Murchie et al., 2002), may have originated from light scattered inside the camera and stray\nlight outside the camera FOV. The intensities of halos were wavelength-dependent, with brighter\nhalos observed in zs-band and darker halos in b-, v-, and w-bands (Fig. 19). Because no\npre-flight data of scattered light were acquired to correct the scattered light and stray light, we\nplan to examine the PSFs using the Moon and Itokawa images and correct for them using the\nimage deconvolution method (see Gaddis et al., 1995).\n\n40\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\n[Figure 19]\n\nIn this paper, we focus on improvements in resolution using the pixel-scale PSFs shown\nin Figure 18. All observed images were blurred due to the PSFs. In general, image-restoration\ntechniques provide modest gains in resolution, remove scattered light and stray light, and\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio. Several image deconvolution algorithms are available, such as\nthe Richardson\u2013Lucy algorithm, the Wiener filter, and the s-CLERAN algorithm. We applied the\nRichardson\u2013Lucy algorithm (hereafter, RL algorithm; Richardson 1972; Lucy 1974, see also\nWhite 1994), which converges to the maximum likelihood solution for Poisson statistics in the\ndata. The noiseless blurred image can be written as follows:\n\nIk (i) = \" Pk (i | j ) Ok ( j ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nj\n\n!\n\nwhere Pk(i | j) denotes the PSF at a given filter k, that is, the fraction of light from the true\nlocation j that is scattered into observed pixel i; and O is the unblurred object. The RL algorithm\ntakes the image estimates and improves them using the following iteration equation:\n\n41\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nDk (i) + R 2 /g\n2\n/g\nk,n\n\n\" P (i | j ) I (i ) + R\n( j)\n\" P (i | j )\nk\n\nOk,n +1 ( j ) = Ok,n\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nk\n\ni\n\n!\n\nwhere D(i) is the observed image; In is the n-th estimate of the blurred image; and R and g are the\nread-out noise and gain (number of electrons per DN), respectively. After preparing the images\nby correcting hot pixels using the in-flight hot pixel table and the axisymmetric PSFs shown in\nFig. 18 plus the read-out noise model (Table 1), iteration of Eq. (8) generated the restored images.\nFigure 20 shows an example resultant image.\n\n[Figure 20]\n\nThe image restoration algorithm yielded good results, improving the image resolution in\nall AMICA channels.\n\n4-4. Stray light\n\n42\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nThe dark level was monitored in-flight during star observations; that is, the backgrounds\nof the star images were regarded as the dark level, composed of dark current and bias. The\nbrightness of the natural sky background in the AMICA viewing direction (2x10-6 W m-2 str \u03bcm\nat 0.55 \u03bcm, Leinert et al., 1998) is too faint to be detected with AMICA (estimated intensity\n~1x10-3 DN s-1). Nevertheless, the background sky level of several observations was higher than\nexpected, although the CCD temperature stayed within a small temperature range (-29 to -26oC).\nThese higher levels were probably due to light from the off-optical axis, incompletely blocked by\nthe AMICA baffle.\n\nIn the nominal attitude of the spacecraft, the Sun shines on +ZSC and +XSC panels, while\nAMICA is attached on the \u2013ZSC panel near the \u2013XSC plane (Fig. 21). We found that data with\nhigher dark levels were obtained when the Sun illuminated \u00b1YSC panels. In this tilted position,\nthe Sun could illuminate the sampler horn, which is located close to AMICA. We examined the\nlight rate [DN s-1] as a function of an azimuth angle !, the angle between the +XSC direction of\nthe spacecraft and the Sun-pointing vector projected on the spacecraft XSC\u2013YSC plane (see Fig.\n21). The tilt angle of the ZSC\u2013YSC plane, %, was limited to within 10 \u030a. Figure 22 supports the\nconjecture that the light rate varies with varying !. This limitation of % ensured that the stray\nlight contribution would be less than ~0.1 DN for Itokawa observations because the asteroid\n\n43\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nobservation exposures would be approximately 0.1 s or less. Therefore, we ignored off-axis stray\nlight from the Sun in Itokawa images.\n\n[Figure 21]\n\n[Figure 22]\n\n5. Summary\n\nIn this paper, we outlined the design, in-flight operation, performance, and calibration of\nAMICA. Key in-flight calibration results include:\n\n(1) The AMICA signal is linear with respect to input signal to an accuracy of <<\n1% when the signal level is < 3800 DN.\n(2) The AMICA v-band (0.55 \u03bcm) absolute radiance calibration is accurate to\nwithin 4% or less.\n(3) The pixel-to-pixel precision of the calibrated relative reflectance data is less\n\n44\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nthan 3%.\n(4) The accuracy of the disk-integrated spectra with respect to the AMICA v-band\nis 1% or less.\n(5) The background zero level uncertainty is # 5 DN.\n(6) Both dark current and stray light from outside the FOV are negligibly small in\nthe Itokawa images.\n(7) The focal length is 120.80 \u00b1 0.03 mm (distortion parameter ignored), yielding a\n5.83\u00b0!5.69\u00b0 FOV.\nThe calibration provided a geometric albedo for Itokawa of 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 (Ishiguro et al,\nin preparation), in good agreement with that obtained from ground-based observations\n(Thomas-Osip et al., 2008). The calibrated AMICA spectra are also well-matched the spectra\ntaken by the ground-based observatories. Scattered light inside the optics, most obvious in the p\nand zs-bands, was identified, but not yet quantified to permit removal from image data. We plan\nto improve the point-spread function to subtract the components by image deconvolution.\n\n45\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nAppendix. ONC File Naming Conventions\n\nThe file naming convention for ONC images is {T}{C}{nnnnnnnnnn}_{filter}.fits, where: {T}\nindicates the type of data (\"S\" for scientific data or \"N\" for navigation data), {C} identifies the\nname of the instrument (T, W1, and W2 for ONC-T (i.e. AMICA), ONC-W1, and ONC-W2,\nrespectively); {nnnnnnnnnn} is the mission elapsed time when the images is generated in\nONC-E; {filter} is the name of the filter (ul, b, v, w, x, p, and zs, respectively).\n\n46\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe detailed inflight testing of the AMICA was made possible by the dedication and hard work\nof many members of the Hayabusa Mission teams.

The azimuth angle, !, is the angle between the\n+XSC direction of the spacecraft and the Sun-pointing vector projected on the spacecraft XSC\u2013YSC\nplane. % is the tilt angle of the ZSC\u2013YSC plane. The tilt angle was limited to within 10 \u030a.\n\nFigure 22.\nStray light (sky flux \u2013 dark current) rate versus spacecraft azimuth angle !. The nominal\nattitude of Hayabusa corresponds to the zero azimuth angle, where the Sun illuminates only the\n+X panel. The large azimuth angle possibly allows for stray light from the direct illumination of\nthe nearby sampler horn.\n\n76\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 1\n\n77\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 2.\n\n78\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 3\n79\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 4.\n\n80\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 5.\n\n81\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 6 (a).\n\n82\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 6 (b).\n\n83\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 7.\n\nTemperature history.\n\n84\n\n\fAccepted for the publication of Icarus\n\nFigure 8.
