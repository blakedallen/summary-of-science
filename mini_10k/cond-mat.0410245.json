INTRODUCTION\n\nThe purpose of this contribution is to introduce a simple model of charge and/or magnetic\norder formation generated by an on-site, spin-dependent interaction of itinerant electrons\nwith localized ones, and to provide a preliminary analysis of that model. The model is\nable to capture many essential aspects of magnetism of both the localized and itinerant\nelectrons. It is based on the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM), which was originally proposed\nas a model of metal-insulator transitions in mixed-valence compounds1 . Later on the FKM\nappeared to be suitable for studying some other phenomena as well, as e.g. a tendency\nfor charge-density-wave formation in interacting fermion systems2\u2013 4 . Actually, in most of\napplications studied so far the spinless version of the model was explored. As far as we\nknow, spin degrees of freedom were taken into account only in a few papers5\u201311 , but in all\nof them the interactions between electrons were spin-independent.\nHowever, many experiments show that a charge superstructure often occurs together\nwith a magnetic order12\u201314 . In order to describe both within a single model we proposed\na generalization of the FKM with an anisotropic, spin-dependent local interaction. These\nideas have also been applied to the Hubbard model15 , but that work has been performed\nonly in the limit of a large spin coupling constant; the authors named this model the \"2-band\nIsing-Hubbard model\". Hence we call our model the Ising-Falicov-Kimball model.\nThe model Hamiltonian is\nH=\n\nP\n\nP\n\n<m,n> \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\n(t \u2212 \u03bcd \u03b4nm )d+\nm,\u03c3 dn,\u03c3 + (Ef \u2212 \u03bcf )\n\nP P\n\nm \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\nm \u03b7=\u2191,\u2193\n\n+\nfm,\u03b7\nfm,\u03b7\n\n+\nd+\nm,\u03c3 dm,\u03c3 fm,\u03b7 fm,\u03b7\nm \u03c3,\u03b7=\u2191,\u2193\n+\n+\n+\n(d+\nm,\u03c3 dm,\u03c3 fm,\u2212\u03c3 fm,\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 dm,\u03c3 dm,\u03c3 fm,\u03c3 fm,\u03c3 ),\n\n+U\n\n+J\n\nP P\n\nP\n\nP\n\n(1)\n\nwhere < m, n > means the nearest neighbor lattice sites m and n, \u03c3 and \u03b7 are spin \u2212 1/2\n+\nindices, dm,\u03c3 (fm,\u03c3 ) and d+\nm,\u03c3 (fm,\u03c3 ) are annihilation and creation operators of itinerant\n(localized) electrons, respectively. The on-site interaction between localized and itinerant\nelectrons is represented by two coupling constants: U, which is spin-independent Coulombtype and J, which is spin-dependent Ising-type. The later reflects the Hund's rule force.\nThe other parameters of the model are: the hopping amplitude t (we will set it equal to one\nfor our energy scale), the energy level of localized electrons Ef and the chemical potentials of\nitinerant \u03bcd and localized \u03bcf electrons, respectively. Here Ef and \u03bcf are given as independent\nparameters, but physical properties of the system depend only on the difference \u03bcf \u2212 Ef .\nTaking into consideration that fact, the ground canonical phase diagram was chosen to\nbe displayed in the variables \u03bcd and \u03bcf , as if Ef would be equal to 0. However, it is\nequivalent to another representation with \u03bc and \u03bc \u2212 Ef as independent parameters (if one\nputs \u03bcd = \u03bcf = \u03bc).\nDouble occupancy of the localized electrons is forbidden, implying the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion Uf f between two f \u2212 electrons is infinite. Consequently, at a given site the\nf \u2212electron occupancy is assumed to be nf = nf,\u2191 + nf,\u2193 \u2264 1 and the d \u2212electron occupancy\nto be nd = nd,\u2191 +nd,\u2193 \u2264 2. So there are 3 states per site allowed for the f \u2212electrons (nf = 0;\nnf,\u2191 = 1 and nf,\u2193 = 0; nf,\u2191 = 0 and nf,\u2193 = 1) and 4 states per site allowed for the d\u2212electrons\n(nd = 0; nd,\u2191 = 1 and nd,\u2193 = 0; nd,\u2191 = 0 and nd,\u2193 = 1; nd = 2).\n2\n\n\fThe first three terms of the Hamiltonian (1) form the multicomponent FKM studied\nrecently in the 2D case10 and in the limit of infinite dimensions8,9 . The last term of (1)\ndescribes a simplified interaction that couples spins of an itinerant and localized electron\noccupying the same site. The inclusion of this interaction enables one to describe magnetic\nstructures (in addition to charged ones) produced by localized electrons and, at the same\ntime, the band magnetism of itinerant electrons.\nAll single-ion interactions included in (1) preserve states of the localized electrons, i.e.\nthe itinerant electrons traveling through the lattice change neither occupation numbers nor\nspins of the localized ones. In other words, [H, fi\u03b7+ fi\u03b7 ] = 0 for all i and \u03b7, so the local\noccupation number is unchanged. This is a characteristic feature of the Falicov-Kimball\nbased models, which makes them tractable in a controllable way.\nThe localized electrons play the role of an external, charge and spin dependent potential\nfor the itinerant electrons. This external potential is \"adjusted\" by annealing, so the total\nenergy of the system attains its minimum. So there is a feedback between the subsystems\nof localized and itinerant electrons, and this is the feedback that is responsible for the longrange ordered arrangements of the localized ones, and consequently for the formation of\nvarious charge and/or spin distributions in low temperatures.\nOn the other hand, if the total magnetization of the localized electrons is non-zero, the\npotential experienced by the itinerant spin-up electrons differs from that of spin-down ones.\nAs a result, the spins of the itinerant electrons become partially polarized, so we also have\nunsaturated band magnetism.\nSo far it was a common practice to investigate the isotropic, Heisenberg-type interaction between spins of localized and itinerant electrons (e.g. within a framework of the s-d\nmodel16 ). Here, instead, we propose an Ising-type coupling between the spins (see also\nRef.15 ). An advantage of the latter approach is that the model can be treated rigorously.\nHowever, one can also provide a plausible physical background that justifies the assumption\nthat the spin-flip processes generated by S + S \u2212 and S \u2212 S + operators, which are characteristic for the Heisenberg-type interaction, can be neglected in a first approximation. The\nreasoning comes from a simple notice that magnetic structures observed in many materials\nare stable. So, presumably, electrons moving through a crystal preserve their spins over\nmany lattice sites. Besides, the Ising type coupling between itinerant electrons was already\nstudied in the framework of the s \u2212 d model17 .\nHere we show that the model (1) captures driving mechanismes of formation of stripe\nphases and other charge and/or magnetically ordered superstructures. The class of materials\nfitting this picture is quite big and encompasses conductors that are magnetically ordered\nin low temperatures, but with no sign of the Kondo effect (as the latter implies the spin-flip\nprocess). There is a huge number of such systems, including many compounds of lanthanides\nand actinides, where various complicated magnetic structures were detected18 . However, the\nmodel we propose is primarily aimed to desrcibe systems that display both a charge and\nmagnetic order. In particular, we expect that dopped systems with a large crystal field effect\nwould be the best candidates. The dopped systems, as they are usually composed of ions\nwith different occupancies of localized electrons (a mixed-valency regime) and because they\nusually contain band electrons. This category includes materials, where stripe phases were\nrecently detected as e.g. La1.6 Nd0.4 Srx CuO419 , Y Ba2 Cu3 O6+x 12 , Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 14 or\nLa1.5 Sr0.5 NiO4 20 . The behaviour of systems like those was already analyzed theoretically\n3\n\n\fon a basis of the extended Hubbard model21,22 and the t \u2212 J model23 .\nOn the other hand, a strong crystal field makes a flip of magnetic moment of an ion\ndifficult. Consequently, a process of a simultaneous flip of spins of a localized and an\nitinerant electron becomes rare. This is another justification of taking into account only the\nIsing-type, instead of isotropic Heisenberg-type coupling in the model.\nA major interaction omitted in the Hamiltonian (1) is the Hubbard-type interaction between spin-up and spin-down electrons. An inclusion of that term would make it intractable\nrigorously for arbitrary values of the coupling constants, but once again, one can imagine\na simple justification for the omission. Namely, it is assumed here that the strength of the\non-site interactions between two particles abides by the following hierarchy: a) the largest\none - when the both particles are localized, b) an intermediate one - if one of the particles is\nlocalized and the other is itinerant, c) a negligible one - when the both particles are itinerant. This hierarchy may be summarized by a rather natural rule: the longer time particles\noccupy the same site, the more important becomes interaction between them. We point out\nhere that the cases a) and b) are treated exactly within the model we propose. Obviously,\nthere are no obstacles to include various interactions neglected in the Hamiltonian (1) as\nperturbations. On the other hand, the simplicity of the model (1) makes it attractive for\nstudies using various techniques, both analytical and numerical.\nAn influence of the Hubbard interaction Udd between spin-up and spin-down itinerant\nelectrons on an arrangement of the localized electrons is not known in a general case, but\nfor Udd small we don't expect any dramatic changes of the phase diagram. However, if Udd is\nlarge, the situation may be different. For example, for half-filling (one itinerant electron per\nsite) the itinerant electrons are ordered aniferromagnetically in the large Udd limit and they\nimpose the same simple type of order to the localized electrons. Then, if there is one localized\nelectron per site, the configuration of the localized electrons will be antiferromagnetic, i.e.\nthe same as in the case studied in the current paper. If, however, the density of localized\nelectrons is equal to 1/2, the ground-state configuration D3 (see Fig. 2c) of the model (1)\nwill have higher energy than the phase corresponding to the configuration b displayed in\nFig. 2a. So, if the Hubbard interaction is taken into account transformations of groundstate configurations of localized electrons are expected for some pairs of densities of electrons\n(\u03c1d , \u03c1f ) but not for the whole range of their values.\nIn the current paper we study the ground-state phase diagrams of the model (1) on\nthe square lattice. However, the method we use can be applied to various types of onetwo- or three \u2212 dimensional lattices. The studies are based on the method of restricted\nphase diagrams3 constructed in the grand canonical ensemble (in the plane (\u03bcd , \u03bcf ) - see\nFig. 1a) and then translated into a canonical ensemble diagram (in the plane (\u03c1d , \u03c1f ) - see\nFig. 1b). Working within the framework of a grand canonical ensemble first assures the\nthermodynamic stability conditions are fulfilled (see Ref.24 ).\nAnother important reason for using the chemical potentials \u03bcd and \u03bcf in the model\n(1) is a possibility of changing and adjusting the electron's occupation numbers. Then,\nalthough the model does not contain a hybridization term, suitable changes of the chemical\npotentials or the position of the Ef level can produce appropriate changes of the occupation\nnumbers. In particular, fixing a total number of electrons enables us to study classical\nintermediate valence states, where some localized electrons change their occupancy to move\ninto the delocalized states, conserving the total number of electrons. Of course, a change of\n4\n\n\fthe chemical potentials or Ef cannot evoke a change of the electron states but only their\noccupation numbers.\nPrevious work on the spinless FKM has revealed a rich structure of the phase diagrams3,4 .\nA number of charge ordered superstructures has been found, including stripe and nonstripe\nphases. However, so far little is known about magnetic structures accompanying those of\ncharge ones, except for the limit of large J, where the ferromagnetic order was proven to\nexist for \u03c1d < \u03c1f \u2264 115 . As far as we know, the present study represents the first analysis of\nboth charge and magnetic ordering in the framework of a generalized Falicov-Kimball based\nmodel for finite U and J values.\nIn the next section we explain how the calculations were carried out. The restricted\nphase diagrams are presented and described in the section III. The last section contains\nsummary and conclusions.\nII. METHOD OF CALCULATION\n\nHere we consider all possible configurations of the localized f \u2212 electrons (including\ntheir spins), for which the number of sites per unit cell N0 is less or equal to Nc = 4.\nTaking into account all allowable sizes and shapes of the unit cells, as well as all relevant\ntranslational vectors, we found 47 distinct configurations. Some of them, representing phases\nwith the smallest periods (up to 2 sites in an unit cell) and those with higher periods that\nare analyzed in this paper, are displayed in Fig. 2. The presentation of the configurations is\nchosen in such a way that make an easy observation of their transformations, starting from\nthe ferromagnetic phase (F) and ending either at the antiferromagnetic one (AF) (Confs.\n1\u20134), or at the \"empty\" one (E) (Confs. D1\u2013D5), in accordance with the diagrams given in\nFig. 1.\nFor each periodic configuration in our trial set we performed the Fourier transformation\nof the Hamiltonian (1) and determined the electronic band structure for the conduction\nelectrons. In other words, we solved the eigenvalue problem and found the eigenvalues E\u03bd\u03c3k ,\nwith branch index \u03bd = 1, 2, ..., N0, spin index \u03c3 and the Bloch wavevector k = (kx , ky ) (for\nmore details see Refs.3,4 ). This required us to diagonalize up to 4 \u00d7 4 matrices and resulted\nin analytical formulae for at most 4 different energy bands, separately for spin-up and spindown electrons. (It is the main reason why the maximum size of the unit cell is limited to\nNc = 4 only, as the analytical formulae for phases with larger unit cells are not known in the\ngeneral case.) In the simplest cases, related to 6 configurations with unit cells containing 1\nor 2 sites (Confs. E, F, AF, a, b \u2013 see Fig. 2a and Conf. 3 \u2013 see Fig. 2b), the eigenvalues\nare given in the Appendix. For the remaining configurations, with unit cells containing 3 or\n4 sites, the analytical formulae are quite long and for that reason are not displayed here.\nHaving exact formulae for the energy spectra E\u03bd\u03c3k all quantities of interest can be calculated from the densities of states of spin-up and spin-down electrons\nZ\u03c3 (E) =\n\nXZ\n\u03bd\n\nBZ\n\ndk\u03b4(E \u2212 E\u03bd\u03c3k ).\n\n(2)\n\nIn particular, the electron densities\n\u03c1d\u03c3 (\u03bcd ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bcd\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n5\n\nZ\u03c3 (E)dE\n\n(3)\n\n\fand the total electronic energy per site\nEtot (\u03bcd ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bcd\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nE(Z\u2191 (E) + Z\u2193 (E))dE\n\n(4)\n\nas a function of the chemical potential (the Fermi energy) \u03bcd . The energy per site in the\nground canonical ensemble (the Gibbs thermodynamical potential) is defined as\nEgc = Etot \u2212 \u03bcd (\u03c1d\u2191 + \u03c1d\u2193 ) \u2212 \u03bcf (\u03c1f \u2191 + \u03c1f \u2193 ).\n\n(5)\n\nFor the simplest configurations E, F and AF the quantities can be obtained analytically, but\nthe expressions are rather complicated (they are given in terms of special functions). This\nis way in our calculations we employ a Brillouin zone grid of 100 \u00d7 100 momentum points\nfor each bandstructure. At each discrete momentum point of the Brillouin zone we get at\nmost 4 eigenvalues. Then the eigenvalues of the bandstructure are summed to determine the\nground-state energy for each number of conduction electrons. The Gibbs thermodynamical\npotential is calculated for all possible values of the chemical potentials of the conduction\nand localized electrons through the formula\nEgc ({wi }) =\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\n(\n\nX\n1\n\u01ebj\u03c3 ({wi }) \u2212 \u03bcd \u03c1d\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bcf \u03c1f \u03c3 ),\n10000N0 \u01ebj\u03c3 <\u03bcd\n\n(6)\n\nwhere wi = 0 or \u2191 or \u2193 characterizes the localized electron state at site i, and the symbol\n\u01ebj\u03c3 ({wi }) denotes the energy eigenvalues of the bandstructure for the given configuration of\nlocalized electrons {wi }. The ground canonical phase diagram is constructed in the plane\nof (\u03bcd , \u03bcf ). We directly compare the ground state energies of all phases from the trial set,\nand select the lowest one. Finally, the grand-canonical diagram is translated to a canonical\nphase diagram for arbitrary densities \u03c1f = \u03c1f \u2191 + \u03c1f \u2193 and \u03c1d = \u03c1d\u2191 + \u03c1d\u2193 of the f \u2212 and\nd \u2212 electrons, respectively. This procedure assures thermodynamical stability of all phases\n(both periodic and their mixtures) present in the resulting canonical phase diagrams24 .\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe grand canonical phase diagrams plot phase boundaries, which divide the plane of\nchemical potentials into domains, in each of which a single localized electron configuration\nforms the ground state. The general structure of the diagrams (Fig. 1a) is similar to that\nfound for the spinless FKM3 . It is relatively simple for large U and more complex for small U.\nHowever, since the spin degeneracy is now lifted, new domains related to various magnetic\narrangements having the same distribution of localized particles appear. In particular, the\nupper region corresponding to the full configuration in the spinless case is now split into\na set of phases, ranging from F, through ferri- and various complex antiferromagnetic to\nthe simplest AF phase; see Figs. 1, 2a,b. The lower region corresponds to the empty\nconfiguration (E \u2013 see Fig. 2a), and the largest of the remaining regions is the diluted\nantiferromagnetic phase (D3 \u2013 see Fig. 2c).\nIn the case of U = 8, J = 0.5 the central portion of the diagram is divided into diagonal\nstripes in which various periodic configurations of localized electrons are ground states. The\nsequence of the localized electron densities, reading from the left to right at fixed \u03bcf is 3/4,\n6\n\n\f2/3, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4 (Confs. D1\u2013D5, see Fig. 2c), the \u03c1f = 1/2 phase (D3) being the\nlargest region.\nIn the corresponding canonical diagram (in the plane (\u03c1d , \u03c1f ) ) given in Fig. 1b all these\nphases are situated along the line \u03c1f + \u03c1d /2 = 1. Movement along that line (starting from\nF) corresponds to a dilution of the ferromagnetic state by a gradual replacement of the\nlocalized electrons by itinerant ones in such a way, that each localized electron is replaced\nby two itinerant ones. This is different from the spinless case, where periodic phases are\nlocated along the line \u03c1f + \u03c1d = 1. The difference is related to the fact, that now both spin\nup and spin down itinerant electrons can independently occupy each site, so the total density\n\u03c1d can take any value between 0 and 2.\nThe analysis of the canonical phase diagram displayed in Fig.1b shows a strong tendency\nto antiferromagnetic order in the region of densities \u03c1d around 1 (half-filling) and to the\nferromagnetic order outside that region. Indeed, both the phases D2 and D3 (see Fig. 2c)\nsituated along the line \u03c1f + \u03c1d /2 = 1 and those represented by the configurations no. 3, 4\nand AF (see Figs. 2a,b) situated along the line \u03c1f = 1 are ordered antiferromagnetically.\nFor intermediate values of the density \u03c1d and \u03c1f = 1 both antiferro- and ferrimagnetically\nordered phases are found (Conf. 1 and 2 \u2013 see Fig. 2b). These phases represent consecutive\nstages of a reconstruction process when F transforms into the simplest AF with an increase\nof \u03c1d .\nOn the other hand, only ferro- (F, D1, D4, D5 \u2013 see Figs. 2a,c) and antiferro- (D2,\nD3 \u2013 see Fig. 2c), but not ferrimagnetically ordered phases were found along the line\n\u03c1f + \u03c1d /2 = 1. Moving along that line (in Fig. 1b) from the left-upper corner (\u03c1d = 0,\u03c1f = 1)\nto right-lower one (\u03c1d = 2,\u03c1f = 0) one can notice that the process of dissolution of the full\nferromagnetic phase overlaps with the tendency to antiferromagnetism inside a region around\nhalf-filling.\nThe picture becomes more complicated as U is reduced. An example is the case of U = 2\nand J = 0.5 (not displayed here), where complex structures of the diagrams are found both\nin the plane of chemical potentials (\u03bcd , \u03bcf ) and densities (\u03c1d , \u03c1f ). First of all, more phases\nappear in the diagrams (20, versus 12 in the case of U = 8) and the domains occupied by\nthe phases in the central region are no longer diagonal stripes parallel to each other, but\nhave a less regular structure.\nThe phases from the central region are distributed in different sectors of the plane (\u03c1d , \u03c1f )\nin the corresponding canonical phase diagram. Only three periodic phases are found along\nthe line \u03c1f + \u03c1d /2 = 1: D3, D5 and D1a \u2013 see Figs. 2c,d. Two of them (D3 and D5)\nalready appeared in the U = 8 case, but the ferrimagnetically polarized D1a phase replaces\nthe ferromagnetic D1 (compare Figs. 2c,d). This fact illustrates a possibility of phase\ntransitions from one magnetic structure to another with a change of U.\nAnother characteristic feature of the periodic phases found in the U = 2 diagram is their\nstability with respect to finite intervals of the density \u03c1d . This means that the Fermi level\nof the corresponding phase lies inside its energy band, so those phases are conducting. This\nis just the opposite to the situation found in the U = 8 diagram (Fig.1b), where the phases\nD1\u2013D5 are ground states for fixed values of itinerant electron densities \u03c1d , corresponding to\ninsulating states (the Fermi levels are situated inside their energy gaps).\nPresumably, if we increase the maximum size of unit cells Nc , then phases with larger\nperiods will enter the phase diagram in such a way, that intrevals of the density \u03c1d where\n7\n\n\flow-period phases are stable will decrease. It is not clear from our studies if the intervals\nshrink to single values or to finite intervals of the density in the full phase diagram. Perhaps\nthe first scenario occurs for some phases and the other for the rest.\nA common feature of the canonical diagrams for U = 8 and U = 2 is that in both\ncases the fully occupied phases with \u03c1f = 1 (Confs. F, 1\u20134, AF) are the same and have\nidentical positions. It appears that a distribution of these phases is symmetric with respect\nto half-filling \u03c1f = 1 and it does not depend on U, but merely on J.\nPhases with \u03c1f = 1 that appear in the diagrams shown in Fig. 1 seem to be stable\nwithin finite intervals of \u03c1d . This means that their ground states can be conducting. In\nparticular, antiferromagnetic conductors appear to be possible ground states for certain\nelectron concentrations off of half-filling. However, this is probably an artifact due to the\nrestriction imposed by the maximum period of configuration in the trial set. If one takes\ninto account configurations with larger periods then, presumably, some of them will enter\nthe phase diagrams in such a way, that more and more phases will be stable merely within\nenergy intervals lying inside one of their energy gaps. Therefore, one expects that the full\nphase diagram will contain many periodic phases in the insulating states, and only a part of\nthem, especially those having gapless energy spectra, as e.g. those represented by the Conf.\nE and F, will be conducting.\nA similar situation was observed for the spinless FKM, where large period phases occupy regions of the phase diagram located outside of the energy gaps of phases having low\nperiods2,3 .\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA simple model capable of describing both charge and magnetic structures of localized\nelectrons, as well as itinerant band magnetism, was introduced and investigated on a square\nlattice. Restricted ground state phase diagrams were constructed for intermediate values\nof the coupling parameters. Various types of charge and magnetically ordered phases were\ndetected for a range of band fillings, illustrating e.g. consecutive stages of transformation of\nF to AF with an increase of the band filling.\nIt is remarkable, that the results presented here are consistent with those found for the\nHubbard model in the large U limit25 and also with those obtained in Ref.15 , where - in\nturn - the limit of large J was investigated, as in all these cases one gets the simplest AF\nat half-filling and F far away from that limit. However, according to Ref.15 and Ref.25 the\nferromagnetic ground state extends to all band fillings but half-filling, which is consistent\nwith the Nagaoka theorem26 . This, of course, is a consequence of investigation of the large\nU or J limit.\nHere, instead, we provide results that give an opportunity to determine the upper limit\nfor the density of itinerant electrons below which F can be stable for finite U and J. Indeed,\na direct comparison of energies of phases from the restricted set (they were calculated rigorously by using the exact analytical formulae for their energy spectra) shows that F can be\nstable for \u03c1d \u2264 0.131 (or \u03c1d \u2265 2 \u2212 0.131) if J = 0.5 and for \u03c1d \u2264 0.233 (or \u03c1d \u2265 2 \u2212 0.233)\nif J = 1. These results complete those given in Ref.15 , where no critical value for \u03c1d below\nwhich F is stable was reported. From the theorems provided in Ref.15 it may be merely\nconcluded, that F is stable for any 0 < \u03c1d < \u03c1f if \u03c1f = 1 and J is large enough.\n8\n\n\fSince no restrictions were here imposed on values of U or J, it was not a great surprise\nthat other ordered phases than just the simplest AF and F have been detected for intermediate electron concentrations. In particular, various magnetically ordered phases were found\nfor \u03c1f = 1 (when charge is distributed uniformly) and intermediate U and J, illustrating a\ntransformation of F to AF with an increase of band filling.\nBut what are the physical reasons and what are the driving forces that lead to the complex\ncharge and/or magnetic arrangements? If one attempts to describe such behavior in terms\nof two-body forces, then interactions between more distantt than the nearest neighboring\nlattice sites needs to be exploited. The double exchange27 and RKKY interactions, derived\nfrom the correlated electron models by using perturbative methods, are prominent examples\nof such approaches.\nOn a basis of the present studies we conclude that the phenomenon of charge and/or\nmagnetic ordering can be explained by a mutual adjustment of the distributions of the\ncharges and spins of the itinerant and localized electrons. This idea is not new, since it\nconstitutes a background for the famous density functional theory. The difference is that\nwe already start from an effective Hamiltonian (represented here by (1)) and consider many\nlattice sites instead of focusing on the details of a charge distribution around a single site,\nas is commonly practiced in the ab initio calculations. This allows us to take into account\nthe kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons and to extract the most essential information\nabout the system under investigation.\nIndeed, one needs to investigate large enough areas accessible for itinerant electrons, as\ntheir total energy depends on the distribution of the localized ones over many lattice sites. If\nthe latter forms a charge and/or magnetically ordered structure, then the mean values of the\ncharge density distribution and/or the spin polarization of the moving electrons also adopts a\nsuitable structure. It is clear that in the simplest case of a ferromagnetic metal, the densities\nof itinerant spin-up and -down electrons spread out uniformly over the whole lattice, but\ntheir values on each site are different, i.e. the moving electrons are polarized. But in the\ngeneral case the distributions of itinerant spin-up and -down electrons are inhomogeneous\nand they may differ one from another.\nSuch an inhomogeneous distribution means that the itinerant electrons have some more\npreferable routes of travelling though the crystal (the routes may be different for the spin-up\nand -down electrons). So one can notice here something like a traffic self-regulation, where\nthe system of localized electrons orders in such a way that the itinerant electrons would have\nas much freedom to move as possible. This of course is governed by the quantum mechanical\nlaws through a minimization procedure of the total energy, which depends not only on the\ncoupling constants, but also on the densities of the electrons.\nIt is interesting that many of the stable structures are axial (the lines of equivalent sites\nare parallel to the lattice axis) or diagonal (the corresponding lines are oriented along the\n(1,1) direction) stripes. Axial stripes are predominant for rather small band fillings, i.e.\nfor small densities of itinerant electrons, and the diagonal stripes are found close to the\nhalf-filling. The same picture was already observed for the spinless FKM4 .\nThis stripe-type ordering means that the itinerant electrons prefer to move along simple,\none-dimensional channels. Has this observation anything to do with, or can it shed light on\na mechanism of the high \u2212 Tc superconductivity? It is too early to answer this question, but\nthe fact is that the stripe ordered phases have been detected in many high \u2212 Tc materials.\n9\n\n\fSo further studies along the lines indicated here will be interesting.\nAnother point is that the detection of charge and magnetic phases other than F or AF\nprovides an opportunity to describe various structures observed in many systems. Indeed,\nfor many years various complex magnetic structures were observed in materials containing\ntransition metals, rare-earths or actinides. Recently, thanks to new precise experimental\ntechniques, stable charge superstructures have been also found in a number of compounds\n(see e.g.12 and the references given there). The model proposed here is capable to describe\nsuch structures in a simplified way but, of course, this work is merely the first step towards a\ncomplete analysis of the apparently very complicated processes occurring in real materials.\nIt is worthwhile to notice, that even though only the restricted phase diagrams were\nanalyzed here, the conclusions are expected to also hold for the complete phase diagrams.\nThis conjecture comes from the fact that the reported results are consistent with those\nobtained exactly in limiting cases and from a comparison with the data found previously for\nthe spinless FKM, where an increase in the size of the allowed unit cells does not produce\nsignificant qualitative change in the phase diagram.\nIn closing we admit that it is clear that the simple effective model presented in this paper\ncannot describe many interesting phenomena observed in solids, like the Kondo effect or the\nsuperconductivity. However, since it is already a non-trivial model that can describe some\nof the phenomena, it can serve as a reference system for studies of more elaborate models\nof correlated electron systems.\n\n10\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI would like to thank Prof. G.

Panel (c), the configurations D1\u2013D5 with\n\u03c1f < 1, which are found in the restricted phase diagrams for U = 8 and J = 0.5 between the F and\nE phases; on the canonical phase diagram (Fig. 1b) they appear along the diagonal \u03c1f + \u03c1d /2 = 1.\nPanel (d), the configurations with \u03c1f = 1 (Confs. 1a, 5), that are found between the F and AF\nphases in the restricted phase diagrams for U = 8 and J = 1.0, but are not found on the diagrams\nfor U = 8 and J = 0.5: Conf. 1a replaces Conf. 1, whereas Conf. 5 appears between Conf. 4 and\nAF. The configuration D1a with \u03c1f = 0.75 is found on the restricted phase diagrams for U = 2\nand J = 0.5 instead of D1 (see Fig. 2b).\n\n13\n\n\f\u0005f\n\n\u0006a \u0007\n\n14\n\n1 2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nAF\n\n12\n\nF\nD4 D5\n10\n8\n\nE\n\nD3\nD1 D2\n\n6\n4\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\u0004d\n\n\u0002b \u0003\n\nf\n\nF 1 2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAF\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2 1 F\n\n1\n\nD1\n0.75\n\nD2\nD3\n0.5\n\nD4\nD5\n0.25\n\nE\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u0001d\n\n\fE\n\nF\n\nAF\n\na\n\nb\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\fD1\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\nD2\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\nD3\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\nD5\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\nD4\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\f1a\n\n5\n\nD1a\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2191\n\n\u2193\n\n\f"}
