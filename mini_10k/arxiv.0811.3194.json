The\nmeasured density imbalance between the two valleys, which is a measure of the valley susceptibility\nwith respect to parallel magnetic field, is enhanced compared to the predictions of non-interacting\ncalculations, reflecting the role of electron-electron interaction.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe physics governing the valley splitting in multivalley two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs), such as\nin Si field-effect-transistors, has been of interest for some\ntime [1, 2]. It is attracting renewed attention in 2DESs\nin Si, AlAs, and graphene [3, 4], both as a fundamental\nproblem, and also because of the possibility that manipulating the electron valley degree of freedom might lead\nto novel (\"valleytronics\") devices [5, 6, 7]. Traditionally,\nthe valley energies have been controlled via strain, confinement and electric field [1, 2, 8, 9]. In this Letter we\ndemonstrate how a magnetic field (Bk ) applied parallel\nto the 2D plane can also break the valley degeneracy\nand shift the valley energies of a 2DES with finite layer\nthickness. In such a system, Bk couples to the electron\norbital motion and deforms the electron wave function\nin the confinement direction. To first order, this deformation increases the valley energies (diamagnetic shift)\nand, to second order, it increases the effective mass in\nthe direction perpendicular to Bk [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nIn our AlAs samples, where two valleys with anisotropic\nFermi contours are occupied, when Bk is applied along\nthe major axis of one the valleys and perpendicular to\nthe other valleys' major axis, it shifts the valleys' energies by different amounts. Remarkably, the measured\nenergy shift and the resulting valley density imbalance\nare much larger than simple calculations would predict,\nsignaling a clear enhancement of the Bk -induced valley\nspitting, likely due to electron-electron interaction. (The\nparameter rs , defined as the average inter-electron spacing measured in units of the effective Bohr radius, ranges\nfrom 6.4 to 9.8 for our samples.)\nFigure 1 summarizes our experimental setup and measurements. We studied four samples; here we focus on\ntwo samples where the 2DES is confined to either an\n11 nm-wide or a 15 nm-wide AlAs quantum well (QW),\ngrown using molecular beam epitaxy on a semi-insulating\nGaAs (001) substrate. The AlAs well is flanked by AlGaAs barriers and is modulation-doped with Si [15]. In\nthese samples the electrons occupy two conduction-band\nvalleys with elliptical Fermi contours as shown in Fig.\n1(b) [16], each centered at an X point of the Brillouin\nzone, and with an anisotropic effective mass (longitudi-\n\n(a)\n[010]\n\n(b) k y\n[010]\n\n\u03b8\n\nB\n\nsample\npiezo\n\n[100]\n\nstrain\ngauge\n\n\u2212\n\nB||=0\n\n[010]\nB||\n\n(f)\n[100]\n\n(c)\nB|| ||x\nkx\n\nkx\n\n[100]\n(d)\n\nky\n\n+\n\nB||\n\nDOS\n\n(e)\nE\n\nDOS\n\n(g)\nEF\n\nE\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic diagrams showing: (a) Experimental setup; (b) and (c) Valley occupations at zero (light\ngreen) and finite (dark green) parallel magnetic fields; (d) and\n(f) Fermi contour distortions due to parallel magnetic field\nfor the [100] and [010] valleys; (e) and (g) Density-of-states\n(DOS) for the [100] and [010] valleys before (light green) and\nafter (dark green) the application of parallel magnetic field.\n\nnal mass ml = 1.05 and transverse mass mt = 0.20, in\nunits of free electron mass, me ) [5]. We denote these two\nvalleys according to the direction of their major axis:\n[100] and [010] (Fig. 1(b)). In our experiments Bk is\napplied along [100] as schematically shown in Fig. 1(a).\nSince the two valleys have different orientations with respect to Bk , the diamagnetic shift and the effective mass\nenhancement are different for the two valleys, as illustrated in Figs. 1(d-g), causing an electron transfer from\nthe [100] to the [010] valley (see Fig. 1(c)). This density\nimbalance (\u2206n) caused by Bk can be countered by applying symmetry-breaking strain \u01eb = \u01eb[100] \u2212 \u01eb[010] , where\n\u01eb[100] and \u01eb[010] are the strain values along the [100] and\n[010] directions. In our study, we monitored the sample\nresistance vs. \u01eb at different values of Bk to determine\n\u2206n as a function of Bk . In order to apply tunable strain\n\n\f2\nour samples were glued to a piezoelectric stack actuator\nas shown in Fig. 1(a) [16, 17]. The measurements were\nperformed in a 3 He cryostat with a base temperature of\n0.3 K. The system was equipped with a tilting stage, allowing the angle \u03b8 between the sample normal and the\nmagnetic field to be varied in situ.\nBefore presenting the experimental data, we will first\noutline the theoretical formalism that describes this valley splitting. Using the same approach as in Refs. [10]\nand [11], we start with a simple, single-particle effective\nmass Hamiltonian in three-dimensions:\n(py + qBk z)2\np2\np2x\n+\n+ z + V (z)\n2mx\n2my\n2mz\n\n(1)\n\nwhere px , py , pz are momentum operators, mx , my , mz\nare effective masses in x, y, z directions, q is the electron\ncharge and V (z) is the confinement potential in the z\ndirection which is assumed to be a QW with 210 meV\nbarrier heights and 11 nm or 15 nm of well width for\n~ =\nour two sample structures [16]. We use the gauge A\n(0, Bk z, 0). Solutions to the above Hamiltonian are plane\nwaves in x and y directions. Substituting the plane wave\nsolutions leads to the one-dimensional Hamiltonian:\n2h\u0304ky qBk z + (qBk z)2\np2\n(2)\nH1D = z + V (z) +\n2mz\n2my\nwhere the last two terms containing Bk can be described\nas perturbations to the Hamiltonian H0 = p2z /2mz +\nV (z). To first order, the ground state energy is shifted to\nhigher values because of the second perturbation term,\n(qBk z)2 /2my . To second order, the effective mass in the\ny direction (h\u03042 /(d2 E/dky2 )) becomes enhanced since the\nfirst perturbation term (h\u0304ky qBk z/my ) is linear with ky .\nEventually, the total energy for the ground state can be\nwritten as follows:\nE=\n\nh\u03042 ky2\nh\u03042 kx2\n+\n+ E0 + \u2206E0\n2mx\n2m\u2032y\n\n(3)\n\nwhere E0 is the ground state energy of H0 , \u2206E0 is the\n\u2032\nground state energy shift, and my is the enhanced effective mass in the y direction.\nInitially, the two valleys have the same solutions to\nH0 because of their same mass in the z direction. The\ncrucial observation is that the perturbation terms in Eq.\n(2) depend on my which is different for the two valleys.\nThe [100] valley has a smaller mass in the y direction and\ntherefore feels a stronger perturbation at a given Bk . Its\nenergy is shifted more compared to the [010] valley, causing a splitting with Bk . The quantity we measure experimentally is \u2206n caused by Bk , and contains two terms:\none, the difference in the ground state energies and the\nother, the difference in the density-of-states caused by\nthe mass enhancement. To second order in perturbation,\n\u2206n can be written as:\n\u221a\nml mt\n1\n2\u03c0h\u03042 n\n1\n\u2212\n)(1 \u2212\n)\n(4)\n\u2206n = \u03b1(\n\u221a\nml\nmt\n(E1 \u2212 E0 ) ml mt 2\u03c0h\u03042\n\nenergy\n\n4\n3\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n00]\n\n[1\n\n1\n\n[010\n\n(b)\n\n]\n\n200\n\nn = 2.52x1011 cm-2\n\n(a)\n\n100\nB || =3.4T\n\n0\n\nR (\u03a9 )\n\nH3D =\n\n4\n\no\n\n\u03b8=44.3\n\n200\nB || =9.23T\no\n\n\u03b8=69.4\n\n0\n200\n\nB || =14.4T\no\n\n0\n\n\u03b8=76.4\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n-4\n\ne (10 )\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Resistance vs. strain traces for\nan 11 nm-wide AlAs QW taken at \u03bd = 3 for different parallel magnetic fields.

Although second order perturbation theory gives analytic answers, in our calculations\nwe numerically solved the Schrodinger's equation using\na finite difference method; i.e., the values we report are\nnumerically exact solutions to H1D in Eq. (2).\nExperimentally, we determine \u2206n vs. Bk by monitoring the sample resistance (R) as a function of \u01eb in\ntilted magnetic fields. Examples of such piezo-resistance\ntraces are shown in Fig. 2(a). Each trace was taken at a\nfixed \u03b8 and magnetic field so that the 2DES remains at\na fixed Landau level (LL) filling factor (\u03bd=3 in the case\nof Fig. 2(a) data). With applied \u01eb, the LLs for the [100]\nand [010] valleys cross each other, as the fan diagram in\nFig. 2(b) indicates. R exhibits minima as the Fermi energy (EF ) passes through consecutive energy gaps, and\nmaxima as it coincides with the LL crossings. The fan\ndiagram in Fig. 2(b) is drawn for a fully spin polarized\nsystem; this is indeed the case for the traces shown in\nFig. 2(a) because of the large Zeeman splitting due to\nthe high magnetic field. From the piezo-resistance traces,\nthe \"balanced point,\" i.e., the strain at which the valleys\nare equally occupied at a given Bk can be measured by\nfollowing the resistance peaks indicated by closed circles.\n(The balanced point at Bk = 0, which corresponds to\n\u01eb = 0, is determined experimentally from R vs. \u01eb sweeps\nat even fillings as has been detailed in Ref. [17].) The\ndata of Fig. 2 clearly show that the valley energies are\n\n\f3\n1.0\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nPV ; \u2206n/n\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n100\n2\n\nn = 3.72x1011 cm-2\n\n\u2206 n (10 11cm -2 )\n\n0.8\n\n(c)\n\n200\n2\n\nB || (T )\n\n\u03bd=4\n\u03bd=5\n\u03bd=6\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\nenergy\n\n-0.2\n0]\n[10\n[01\n0]\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n200\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\u03bd=6\n\n100\n0\n\nR (\u03a9 )\n\nsplit with the application of Bk .\nIn Fig. 3(a) we show a set of R vs. \u01eb traces taken at\na fixed \u03b8 for \u03bd = 4, 5 and 6. Again, in all these traces,\nthe 2DES is fully spin polarized because of the very large\nBk . The traces are periodic in \u01eb, implying that they\nare consistent with a simple, linear LL fan diagram, an\nexample of which is shown in Fig. 6(b) for \u03bd = 6. By\nassociating the R maxima with the LL coincidences, we\ncan determine the valley polarization, PV , defined as the\ndifference between the [010] and [100] valley populations\ndivided by the total 2DES density (i.e., \u2206n/n), at each\ncoincidence. We therefore obtain a direct measure of PV\nvs. \u01eb which we plot, for \u03bd = 6, as black squares in Fig.\n3(c); note that PV is equal to -1/6, 1/6, 3/6 and 5/6 for\n\u03bd = 6 coincidences from left to right. The lines in Fig.\n3(c) provide two pieces of useful information. First, their\nintercepts with the PV axis provide direct measures of\nPV , or equivalently, \u2206n, for given values of Bk . In the\ninset to Fig. 3(c), we show a plot of \u2206n vs. Bk2 . Note that\nthe plot is approximately linear, consistent with what we\nexpect from Eq. (4). Second, the slopes of the lines in\nFig. 3(c) give a measure of the valley susceptibility with\nrespect to strain [17], i.e., the rate of change of \u2206n with\n\u01eb; note that the slopes are independent of \u03bd for a fixed\ndensity, consistent with the measurements of [17] which\nwere done in the absence of parallel field.\nTo summarize our results, in Figs. 4(a) and (b) we\nplot the measured \u2206n vs. \u01eb and vs. Bk2 , respectively,\nfor the 11 nm-wide AlAs QW at three different densities.\nThe data in Fig. 4(a) were obtained from lines such as\nthose shown in Fig. 3 (c), but after subtracting their intercepts with the \u2206n axis. Figure 4(a) data essentially\nrepresent \u2206n vs. \u01eb in the absence of Bk ; this can be\nverified from comparison of the data with measurements\nreported in Ref. [17] which were done at \u03b8 = 0. In Fig.\n4(a) we also include a plot of \u2206n vs. \u01eb expected based on\nthe band parameters, i.e., ignoring electron-electron interaction and using the simple relation \u2206n = \u01ebE2 m/2\u03c0h\u03042\n\u221a\nwhere m = ml mt = 0.46 and E2 =5.8 eV is the deformation potential for the AlAs X-point conduction band\nminimum [16]. In Fig. 4(a), it is clear that the response\nof the system to strain is two to three times enhanced\ncompared to what the non-interacting (band) parameters\npredict, and that the enhancement is stronger at lower\ndensities (larger rs ). This observation confirms the enhancement of valley susceptibility with respect to strain\n(\u03c7\u01eb ), defined as the rate of change of \u2206n with \u01eb, originally\nreported in Ref. [17]; it is similar to the enhancement of\nthe spin susceptibility observed in similar samples and reflects the role of electron-electron interaction [17, 18, 19].\nOur measured \u2206n caused by Bk are plotted in Fig.\n4(b) vs. Bk2 for the same three densities as in Fig. 4(a).\nAgain, for comparison, we also show the results of the calculations based on the non-interacting picture, i.e., using\nEq. (4). As can be seen in Eq. (4), there is a slight dependence of \u2206n on n and this is why there are three lines\n\n100\n\n9.25 T\n\n\u03bd=5\n11.10 T\n\n0\n\u03bd=4\n\n100\n0\n\nB|| =13.87 T\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n-4\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\ne (10 )\nFIG. 3: (Color online) (a) Resistance vs. strain traces for the\nsame sample as in Fig. 2 but at a higher density, taken at\ndifferent fillings for a fixed tilt angle, \u03b8 = 74.5\u25e6 .

Similar to the strain case of Fig. 4(a), the system's response to Bk2 is about two to three times stronger\nthan the non-interacting calculations predict. This is a\nnoteworthy result as it demonstrates that the interacting\n2DES responds to two very different stimuli (strain and\nBk ) in a very similar fashion. Defining a new quantity,\n\u03c7Bk , as the valley susceptibility with respect to Bk2 , we\nsee from the inset to Fig. 4(b) that \u03c7\u01eb and \u03c7Bk have very\nsimilar magnitudes [21].\nIn Fig. 4(c) we show the summary of Bk -induced \u2206n\nfor a second sample, a 2DES confined to a 15 nm-wide\nAlAs QW.

Insets\nshow the valley susceptibilities, normalized to their band values, with respect to two variables, \u01eb and Bk2 .\n\nwide sample predicts a larger \u2206n for this sample (at a\ngiven density) because of a larger spread of the wave function in the z direction (see Eq. (2)). The deduced, normalized susceptibilities plotted in Fig. 4(c) inset, however, appear to be slightly smaller than those for the 11\nnm-wide sample. It is likely that this is also related to the\nlarger electron layer thickness: Although there have been\nno systematic and detailed studies of the dependence of\n\u03c7\u01eb enhancement on electron layer thickness, it has been\nreported that the spin susceptibility of a thicker electron\nsystem is less enhanced compared to a thinner system\nwith otherwise the same parameters [19, 22].\nOur results demonstrate that a magnetic field applied\nparallel to an AlAs 2DES with finite layer thickness can\nsplit the energies of the two in-plane valleys. The splitting originates from the coupling of the parallel field to\nthe orbital motion of the electrons. Our measurements of\nthe density imbalance due to strain and parallel magnetic\nfield show similar enhancements of the splitting compared to calculations which are based on non-interacting\nelectrons with band parameters. These enhancements\nare more pronounced at lower densities (larger rs ). The\nresults suggest that in an interacting 2DES, the valley\nsplitting is enhanced by interaction, independent of the\nphysical parameter that induces the splitting.\nWe thank the NSF for support, and R.

For example, for the 11 nm-wide\n\nsample, the diamagnetic shift and the mass enhancement\nlead to \u2206n of 5.79 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 and \u22120.88 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 ,\nrespectively at n = 5.12 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 and Bk = 18T.
