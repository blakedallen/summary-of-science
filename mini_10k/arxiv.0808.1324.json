Plasmonic nanofocusing has been predicted2 and experimentally achieved.3,4,5 Nanoconcentration of optical energy at nanoplasmonic probes made possible optical ultramicroscopy with nanometer-scale resolution6,7,8 and ultrasensitive Raman spectroscopy.9\nIt will be very beneficial for the fundamental science, engineering, environmental, and defense applications to be able to nano-concentrate terahertz radiation (frequency 1 \u2212 10 THz or vacuum wavelength \u03bb0 = 300 \u2212 30 \u03bcm). This will allow for the nanoscale spatial resolution for THz imaging10\nand introduce the THz spectroscopy on the nanoscale, taking full advantage of the rich THz spectra and submicron to nanoscale structures of many engineering, physical, and biological objects\nof wide interest: electronic components (integrated circuits, etc.), bacteria, their spores, viruses,\nmacromolecules, carbon clusters and nanotubes, etc. In this Letter we establish the principal limits\nfor the nanoconcentration of the THz radiation in metal/dielectric waveguides and determine their\noptimum shapes required for this nanoconcentration We predict that the adiabatic compression of\nTHz radiation from the initial spot size of R0 \u223c \u03bb0 to the final size of R = 100 \u2212 250 nm can be\nachieved with the THz radiation intensity increased by a factor of \u00d710 to \u00d7250. This THz energy\nnanoconcentration will not only improve the spatial resolution and increase the signal/noise ratio\nfor the THz imaging and spectroscopy, but in combination with the recently developed sources of\npowerful THz pulses11 will allow the observation of nonlinear THz effects and a carrying out a\nvariety of nonlinear spectroscopies (such as two-dimensional spectroscopy), which are highly informative. This will find a wide spectrum of applications in science, engineering, biomedical research,\nenvironmental monitoring, and defense.\n\nThere are existing approaches to deep subwavelength THz imaging and probing based on sharp tips\nirradiated by a THz source,12 adiabatically-tapered\nmetal-dielectric waveguides13 similar to optical adiabatic concentrators,2,3,4,5 and nonlinear microscopic THz\nsources.14 For the development of the THz nanotechnology, it is extremely important to understand spatial limits to which the THz radiation energy can be concentrated (nanofocused).\nA major challenge for the nanoconcentration of the\nelectromagnetic energy in the THz region is the large radiation wavelength in vacuum or conventional dielectrics,\n\u03bb0 = 30 \u03bcm \u2212 300 \u03bcm, where the THz radiation can\nonly be focused to the relatively very large regions of\nsize \u223c \u03bb0 /2. The developed field of optical energy concentration, which is based on surface plasmon polaritons\n(SPPs), suggests that one of the ways to solving this\nproblem is to employ the surface electromagnetic waves\n(SEWs). In the far infrared (ir), the dielectric permittivity of metals has large imaginary part which dominates over its negative real part.15 This implies that\nSEWs propagating along a metal-dielectric flat interface\nin this frequency range, known as Sommerfeld-Zenneck\nwaves,16,17 are weakly bound to the surface18 and can\nhardly be used for the confinement of THz radiation.\nIt has been suggested that periodically perforating flat\nsurfaces of ideal metals with grooves or holes leads to the\nappearance of SEWs, which mimic (\"spoof\") SPPs to be\n\nstronger bound to the surfaces19,20,21 permitting a better\ncontrol over the THz fields. It has been predicted that\nSPPs on an array of parallel grooves cut on the surface\nof a perfect conductor wire can be localized by adiabatic\ndeepening of the grooves.22 At a point, where grooves are\napproximately a quarter of wavelength of light, the highest concentration is achieved to be on the order of tens\nof micrometers. This method restricts the localization\npoint to a particular frequency, making the concentration\nvery narrow-band. Also, the depth of a groove should be\n\u2248 \u03bb0 /4, i.e., in the tens to hundred micron range, which\nprecludes completely nanoscale devices.\nIt is well known from microwave technology that the\nideal-metal waveguides with smooth surfaces support\nTEM waves, where the electric field lines are either infinitely extended or terminate at the metal surfaces normally to them. The latter case requires the waveguide\ncross-section topology to be more than single-connected;\nan example may be a coaxial waveguide (\"coax\"). Such\nwaveguides possess are very wide-band in frequency. The\nTHz waveguides can be adiabatically tapered to concentrate energy. The idea of adiabatic energy concentration\ncomes from ultramicroscopy23,24,25 and nanoplasmonics,2\nwhere it has been developed both theoretically and\nexperimentally3,4,5 and used in ultrasensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.9 Employing these ideas of\nthe adiabatic concentration and using a tapered metaldielectric waveguide, the THz spatial resolution achieved\n\n\f2\nis \u223c 20 \u03bcm across the entire THz spectrum.13\nIn this Letter, for the first time, we establish the\nfundamental limits and find the principles of designing\nthe optimum and efficient metal/dielectric waveguides\nsuitable for the THz nanofocusing. The specific examples are for the wide-band concentrators: a plasmonic\nmetal wedge cavity and tapered coax waveguides, which\nare terminated by funnel-type adiabatic tapers. Such\nnano-concentrators along with the advent of high-power\nsources11,26 and sensitive detectors27 of THz radiation,\nwill open up an extremely wide range of possible THz\napplications, in particular, in material diagnostics, probe\nnanoimaging, biomedical applications etc. \u2013 cf. Refs.\n28,29,30.\nNote that an alternative approach to the THz energy\nconcentration using doped semiconductor tapers has also\nbeen proposed.31 However, the required heavy doping of\nthe semiconductors may cause fast electron relaxation\ndue to the collisions with the inflicted lattice defects and\nbring about high losses. Therefore, in this Letter we\nwill pursue the adiabatic nanoconcentration of the THz\nradiation using metal/dielectric structures.\nConventionally for THz and microwave regions, the\nmetals are considered as ideal which \u221a\nis equivalent to neglecting their skin depth ls = \u03bb0 /Re \u2212\u03b5m , where \u03b5m is\nthe permittivity of the metal (we take into accoint that\nin the THz region |\u03b5m | \u226b 1), and \u03bb0 = c/\u03c9 is the reduced\nwavelength in vacuum. It is true that in the THz region\nls = 30 \u2212 60 nm. i.e., ls \u226a \u03bb0 . However, as we show\nbelow in this Letter, it is the finite skin depth, though\nas small as it is, that principally limits the ultimum localization size of the THz fields. For larger waveguides,\nthe THz wave energy is localized mostly in the vacuum\n(dielectric) and its losses, which occur in the metal's skin\nlayer, are correspondingly small. The effective quality\nfactor (or, figure of merit) of the waveguide, which shows\nhow many periods the wave can propagate without significantly loosing its energy, can be estimated as\nQ \u223c 2a/ls ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a is the characteristic minimum size of the waveguide; this estimate becomes a good approximation for a\nmetal-dielectric-metal planar waveguide [see below Eq.\n(2)]. When the waveguide size reduces to become on the\norder of the skin depth, a . ls , the THz field is pushed\ninto the metal, and the quality factor reduces to Q . 1,\nwhich implies strong losses. Qualitatively, this establishes the limit to the nanoconcentration: for upper THz\nregion a & ls \u2248 30 nm, while for the 1 THz frequency\na & ls \u2248 60 nm. These are the practical limits of the THz\nnanoconcentration for the noble metals (silver, gold, and\nplatinum) and for aluminum.\nIf one pursues the goal of creating enhanced local fields\nin a small region, but not necessarily to efficiently transfer the THz energy from the far field to the near field,\nthen the apertureless SNOM approach, where a sharp\nmetal or dielectric tip is irradiated by THz radiation, can,\nin principle, achieve even higher resolution.32 However,\n\nFIG. 1: Geometry and properties of the THz TM mode in\na parallel metal-slab waveguide. (a) Schematic of the waveguide. The width of the dielectric gap a and the skin depth ls\nare indicated. (b) An instantaneous distribution of the longitudinal electric field Ey along the propagation coordinate y\nfor a = 10 \u03bcm and frequency 1 THz in a silver-vacuum-silver\nwaveguide. (c) The same as in panel (b) but for a = 200\nnm. (d) Modal refraction index n = k/k0 (Re n is denoted by\nthe red line and Im n by the blue line) as a function of the\nwaveguide width a. Dashed green line indicates the value of\nn for the perfect conductor. Skin-depth value is shown by the\nvertical dashed line.\n\nthe efficiency of utilizing the THz energy of the source in\nthis case will be extremely low; the stray, far-field THz\nenergy may create a significant parasitic background.\nHere and below in this Letter, we consider examples\nof the THz adiabatic nanoconcentration quantitatively,\nwhere the effect of the specific geometry will become apparent. Consider first a parallel plate waveguide that\nconsists of a dielectric slab of thickness a with dielectric permittivity \u03b5d sandwiched between two thick metal\nplates (with thickness of at least a few ls , i.e., greater\nthan 200 nm in practical terms) [see Fig.1(a)]. The permittivity of the metal \u03b5m in the THz region has a very\nlarge (& 106 ) imaginary part that defines the very small\nskin depth ls . 100 nm, which justifies the usual consideration of the metals as perfect conductors.15 However,\nas we have already mentioned, for our purposes of the\nTHz nanoconcentration, we need to take into account\nthe field penetration into the metal, which makes the\nproblem plasmonic. In this case, the propagating modes\nof the system are SPPs, which are TM modes characterized by the symmetry with respect to the reflection in\nthe center plane. We will orient the coordinate system\nwith its z axis normal to the plane and the y axis in the\ndirection of propagation. The symmetric (even) modes\nhave even field components Hx and Ez and odd Ey ; the\nparity of the antisymmetric (odd) modes is opposite.\nFrom plasmonics it is known that the even modes have\na larger fraction of their energy localized in the dielec-\n\n\f3\ntric and the odd modes in the metal. Therefore, the\neven modes have much smaller damping and are, therefore, most suitable for the THz energy concentrations.\nThe dispersion relation for the even modes is given in\nthe Methods section as Eq. (5). This equation can be\nmuch simplified and solved in a closed analytical form\ntaking into account that we are interested in the subwavelength focusing, i.e., a . \u03bb, where \u03bb = \u03bb0 /\u03b5d is the\nreduced wavelength in the dielectric; also, in the entire\nTHz region ls \u226a \u03bb. This shows that there exists a small\nparameter in the problem ls a/\u03bb2 \u226a 1 [see also Eq. (6)],\nwhich allows one to solve analytically the dispersion relation (5) obtaining the modal refraction index n = k/k0 ,\nwhere k is the THz wavevector, and k0 = 1/\u03bb0 ,\n\u00131/2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\nls (1 + i)\nls\n, (2)\n\u2248 \u03b5d 1 + i\nn = \u03b5d 1 +\na\n2a\nwhere the approximate equality is valid for not too tight\nnanofocusing, i.e., for ls \u226a a. From this, we can obtain\nthe quality factor of the waveguide Q = Re n/Im n =\n2a/ls , giving a quantitative meaning to the estimate (1).\nPlasmonic effects (i.e. those of the finite skin depth)\nare illustrated in Fig. 1 for silver-vacuum-silver waveguide and frequency of 1 THz. Panels (b) and (c) display\nthe longitudinal electric field Ey obtained by the exact\nsolution of the Maxwell equations. Note that this field\ncomponent is absent for the ideal conductor; here it is\nrelatively small: on the order of 10\u22123 of the transverse\nfield. Panel (b) illustrates the case of a relatively wide\nwaveguide (a = 10 \u03bcm), where it is evident that the electric field is localized mostly in the dielectric region of the\nwaveguide, and the extinction of the wave is small. In a\nsharp contrast, for a nanoscopic waveguide (a = 200 nm)\nin panel (c), the electric field significantly penetrates the\nmetal. In accord with our arguments, there is a very\nsignificant extinction of the fields as they propagate; the\nretardation effects are also evident: the lines of equal\namplitude are at an angle relative to the normal (z) direction. The dependence of the modal refraction index\non the thickness a of the waveguide obtained from Eq.\n(2) is plotted in Fig. 1 (d). This index increases as a becomes comparable with the skin depth. While Re n and\nIm n increase by the same absolute amount, the quality\nfactor Q, obviously, greatly decreases with decrease of a.\nThe mode described above can be used for broadband\nenergy concentration of THz waves.\nTo introduce the THz nanoconcentration, consider a\nmetal-dielectric-metal waveguide that is slowly (adiabatically) tapered off as a wedge, as illustrated in Fig. 2\n(a). Because of the adiabatic change of the parameters,\na wave propagating in such a waveguide will adjust to\nit without reflection or scattering, just as it takes place\nin nanoplasmonic waveguides.2 As a result, propagating\nit will concentrate its energy, conforming to the tapering of the waveguide. The corresponding solution can be\nobtained from the Maxwell equations using the WentzelKramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, similarly to\nthe nanoplasmonic case in the visible,2 as described in\n\nthe Methods section. The WKB approximation is applicable under the conditions that\n\u0001\n(3)\n\u03b4 = d Rek \u22121 /dy \u226a 1 , |da/dy| \u226a 1 ,\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the well-known adiabatic parameter describing\nhow slowly the modal wavelength changes on a distance\nof its own, and |da/dy| is a parameter describing how\nadiabatically the transverse size of the confined mode\nchanges along the propagation coordinate.\nIn the WKB approximation, the behavior of the dominating transverse field component Ez as a function of the\ncoordinate y along the propagation direction is shown for\nthe last 6 \u03bcm of the propagation toward the edge in Fig.\n2 (b). There is a clearly seen spatial concentration of the\nenergy and increase of the field as the wave is guided into\nthe taper. The predicted behavior of the two components\nof electric field and the magnetic field for the last micron\nof the propagation is shown in panels (c)-(e). It apparently indicates the adiabatic concentration, without an\nappreciable loss of the intensity. The THz wave follows\nthe waveguide up to the nanometric size.\nThe red line in Fig. 2 (f) indicates that the local intensity I as the function of the thickness a of the waveguide\nfor a < 4 \u03bcm increases significantly with 1/a, in qualitative accord with the behavior expected for the negligibly low losses. This intensity reaches its maximum\nfor a = 1.6 \u03bcm and then starts to decrease as the losses\novercome the adiabatic concentration. At smaller thicknesses, a . 400 nm, the intensity in Fig. 2 (f) starts\nto increase again, which is unphysical. The reason is\nrevealed by the behavior of the adiabatic parameter \u03b4\nshown by the blue line: for a . 400 nm, \u03b4 becomes relatively large (comparable with 1), i.e., the adiabaticity\nis violated. This is due to the fact that the fraction of\nthe THz field energy propagating in the metal is dramatically increased for a . 400 nm due to the constricted\ntransverse extension of the dielectric in the waveguide.\nThis causes a significant loss per wavelength \u03bb, leading\nto a rapid change of the wave vector k, breaking down\nthe adiabaticity. This constitutes a fundamental difference from the nanoplasmonic adiabatic concentration in\nthe optical region where the adiabatic parameter is constant, and the adiabaticity holds everywhere including\nthe vicinity of the tip.2\nTo provide for the optimum guiding of the THz wave\nand its concentration on the nanoscale, the terminating (nanoscopic) part of the waveguide should be tapered slower, in a funnel-like manner. That is, one\nneeds to decrease the grading da/dy of the waveguide\nnear the edge in order\nto keep the adiabaticity parame\u0001\nter \u03b4 = d Rek \u22121 /da \u00d7 da/dy approximately constant\nand small enough to prevent the back-reflection. Because for \u0001the adiabatic grading (tapering), the derivative\nd Rek \u22121 /da does not depend on the grading (it is the\nsame as for the plane waveguide) and is only a function\nof a, the equation \u03b4 = \u03b4(y) is a differential equation for\nthe shape of the waveguide that can be easily integrated.\nThis results in the dependence of the thickness a on the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: Adiabatic concentration of THz field energy in a\ngraded waveguide, where a dielectric wedge is surrounded by\nthe thick silver layer.

The blue curve displays the dependence on a of the\nadiabatic parameter \u03b4, scaled by a factor of 5.

The units for\nthe fields are arbitrary but consistent between the panels. (d)\nThe THz field intensity I (relative to the intensity I0 at the\nentrance of the waveguide) as a function of the dielectric gap\nthickness a is shown by the red line. The adiabatic parameter scaled by a factor of 10 as a function of a is indicated by\nthe blue line. The values of a indicated at the horizontal axis\nticks correspond to the values of y at the ticks of panels (a)(f).\n\nThe geometry of an adiabatically-tapered end of the\nsilver/vacuum waveguide found from Eq. (4) and satisfying Eq. (3) and the corresponding WKB solutions for\nthe 1 THz fields are shown in Fig. 3 (a)-(c). The optimum shape of the waveguide in this case is funnel-like,\ngreatly elongated toward the edge. The nanoconcentration of the field is evident on panels (a)-(c), as well as\nits penetration into the metal for a . 100 nm. As these\npanels show quantitatively and the red curve on panel\n(d) qualitatively, the field intensity reaches its maximum\nat a \u2248 300 nm where it is enhanced with respect to the\nfield at the entrance to the funnel waveguide by a modest\nfactor of 1.2. At the same time, the adiabatic parameter\n\u03b4 decreases toward the tip from 0.07 to 0.05, indicated\nthe applicability of the WKB approximation everywhere.\nNote that the this funnel-shaped wedge, indeed, continues the linearly-graded wedge waveguide shown in Fig. 2,\nwhich yields the enhancement factor of \u2248 8 at a = 2 \u03bcm.\nSequentially, these two waveguides provide the intensity\nenhancement by approximately \u00d710 while compressing\nthe THz wave to the thickness of a = 300 nm and the\nenhancement by a factor of 3 for a = 100 nm.\nThus, true nanolocalization of THz radiation in one\ndimension (1d) is possible. The minimum transverse size\nof this nanolocalization is determined by the skin depth,\n\n\f5\nas we have already discussed qualitatively in the introductory part of this Letter. The obtained 1d beam of the\nnanoconcentrated THz radiation may be used for different purposes, in particular as a source for the diffraction\nelements including the nanofocusing zone plates of the\ntype introduced in Ref. 33.\nThe two-dimensional (2d) concentration of the THz radiation can be achieved by using an adiabatically-tapered\nconical coax waveguide, whose geometry is illustrated in\nFig. 4 (a). The central metal wire of radius r is surrounded by a dielectric gap of the radial thickness a,\nwhich is enclosed by a thick (\u223c 200 nm or thicker) outer\nmetal shell. Both r and a are smooth functions of the\nlongitudinal coordinate y, which describes the tapering\nof the coax toward the apex (tip) at y = 0. The THz\nwaves propagate from the wide end of the coax toward\nthe apex, adiabatically following the tapering. In the\nspirit of WKB, for any particular y the wave behavior\nfor the tapered coax is the same as for a cylindrical coax\nwith the values of r and a equal to the local values r(y)\nand a(y).\nThe dispersion relation for the coax waveguide that\ntakes into account the plasmonic effects (i.e., the penetration of radiation into the metal and the concurrent\nlosses) is obtained in the Methods section as Eq. (9).\nCalculated from this expression, the dependence of the\nmodal refractive index n = k(a, r)/k0 on the dielectric\ngap a is displayed in Fig. 4 (b) for the frequency of 1\nTHz, silver as a metal, and vacuum in the dielectric gap.\nThe results are shown for two values of the radius of the\ncentral wire: r = 10 \u03bcm and r = 60 nm. As one can\nsee, the real part of the modal index practically does not\ndepend on r; it starts growing when a decreases. The\nimaginary part of the index n increases when the central\nwire thickness r decreases, but this dependence is very\nweak. Both Re n and Im n grow dramatically for r . ls .\nThis is due to the penetration of the THz field into the\nmetal, i.e., it is a plasmonic effect.\nThe WKB solution for the radial field E\u03c1 in the cross\nsection of this coax waveguide is shown for the last 3 \u03bcm\nof the propagation toward the tip in Fig. 4 (c). The adiabatic following and energy concentration are evident in\nthis panel. The penetration into the metal of the tangential (to the metal surface) field components Ey and\nH\u03c6 is noticeable in Figs. 4 (d) and (e). The intensity I\nof the THz field (relative to the intensity I0 at the entrance of the waveguide) as a function of the waveguide\nouter radius R = r + a is shown by the red line in Fig. 4\n(f). Dramatically, it shows the adiabatic nanoconcentration and the intensity increase by more than two orders\nof magnitude for the nanoconcentration from the waveguide radius R = 300 \u03bcm, where the THz radiation can\nbe focused, toward R = 300 nm. However, the dramatic\nincrease of the adiabatic parameter \u03b4 [plotted by the blue\nline in Fig. 4 (f)] for R . 1 \u03bcm shows that these results\ncan only be trusted for R & 1 \u03bcm.\nFor the true 2d nanoconcentration of the THz radiation below this micron-scale radius, similar to the 1d case\n\nFIG. 4: Geometry, modal index of refraction, and THz energy\nconcentration in conically-tapered metal-dielectric waveguide.\n(a) Schematic of geometry and energy concentration. The\ncentral wire and the coax shell are shown along with the\nschematic of the THz energy concentration. (b) Dependence\nof modal refraction index n in coaxial waveguide on the dielectric gap width a for two central wire radii: r = 10 \u03bcm\nand r = 60 nm. The color coding of the lines is indicated.\nThe dielectric in the gap is vacuum. (c) Instantaneous distribution of the radial THz electric field amplitude E\u03c1 in the\ncross section of the coax for the last 3 mm of the propagation\ntoward the tip. The amplitude of the field is color coded by\nthe bar at the top of the panel. (d) Instantaneous distribution of the longitudinal THz electric field amplitude Ey on the\ncoordinate y for the last 620 \u03bcm of the propagation. (e) The\nsame as (d) but for the transverse magnetic field H\u03c6 . The\nunits of these field components are arbitrary but consistent\nbetween the panels. (f) Dependence of THz field intensity in\nthe middle of waveguide gap on the waveguide outer radius\nR = r + a is shown in red. The blue curve displays the adiabatic parameter \u03b4 as a function of R, scaled by a factor of\n102 . The values of R indicated at the successive horizontal\naxis ticks differ by a factor of 10\u22121/2 , i.e., by 5 dB.\n\nof the wedge, to preserve the adiabaticity, a funnel-like\ntapering is necessary. Generally, the tapering of the central wire and that of the outer metal shell do not need\nto be the same. However, we found that better results\nare obtained when it is the case, i.e., the waveguide is\ntapered-off self-similarly. In specific calculations, as everywhere in this Letter, we assume that the metal of\nthe waveguide is silver, the dielectric is vacuum, and the\nfrequency is 1 THz. Doing so, we have found the cor-\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: Adiabatic terahertz energy concentration in a selfsimilarly curved, funnel-shaped coaxial waveguide, where the\nmetal is silver, and the dielectric in the gap is vacuum. The\ndielectric gap is between the pair of the neighboring curved\nlines, and the metal is everywhere else. (a) Instantaneous\ndistribution of the radial (transverse) component E\u03c1 of the\nelectric field of the guided THz wave as a function of the\npropagation coordinate along the wedge y for the last 600 \u03bcm\nof the propagation. (b) The same for the longitudinal electric\nfield component Ey . (c) The same for transverse magnetic\nfield H\u03c6 , whose lines form circles around the central metal\nwire. The units of these field components are arbitrary but\nconsistent between the panels. (d) The THz intensity I as a\nfunction of the waveguide radius R, displayed relative to the\nintensity I0 at the beginning of the waveguide (red line). Adiabatic parameter \u03b4 multiplied by a factor of 10 as a function\nof R (blue line). The values of the radius R shown at the ticks\ncorrespond to those of y shown in panels (a)-(c).\n\nresponding grading of the waveguide using Eq. (4) and\nsetting \u03b4 = 0.05, which is small enough to satisfy the\nadiabaticity very well. In this case, indeed, we have used\nthe corresponding dispersion relation (9). The obtained\nshape of the waveguide is a strongly-elongated funnel, as\nshown in Fig. 5 (a)-(c). These figures display the THz\nfields that we have calculated in the WKB approximation\nfor this waveguide. As one can see from these figures,\nwithin the last half micron of the propagation, the electric and magnetic fields of the THz wave efficiently follow the adiabatically curved waveguide. The penetration\ninto the metal of the tangential (to the metal-dielectric\ninterfaces) field components for y < 400 \u03bcm is evident in\npanels (b) and (c). The longitudinal electric field component Ey is significantly localized in the central metal\nwire [panel(b)], which is a plasmonic effect.\nThe dependence of the THz field intensity in the gap\n(relative to the intensity I0 at the entrance of this funnel) on the total radius of the waveguide R is shown in\nFig. 5 (d) by the red line. In this case, the adiabatic\nconcentration is very efficient. The intensity of the THz\nradiation increases by a factor of \u00d75 when it is compressed from the initial radius of R = 1 \u03bcm to the radius\n\nR \u2248 250 nm. The penetration of the fields into the metal\nfor smaller values of the radius R (tighter confinement)\ncauses losses that dominate over the effect of the concentration. Again, we remind that this funnel waveguide is\na continuation and termination for the straigt cone that\nyields the field enhancement by \u00d750 for R = 1 \u03bcm [see\nFig. 4 (f)]. Consecutively, these two waveguides (the initial cone continued and terminated by the funnel) are\nvery efficient, adiabatically compressing the THz radiation from the initial radius R = 300 \u03bcm to the radius\nR = 250 nm increasing its intensity by a factor \u00d7250.\nEven for the final radius R = 100 nm, the total THz\nintensity is increased by a factor of \u00d710 (which is the\nproducts of factors \u00d750 for the cone part and \u00d70.2 for\nthe funnel. Thus, the optimally graded plasmonic-metal\n2d waveguide is very efficient in the concentration and\nguidance of the THz fields with the transverse radius of\nconfinement R . 100 nm.\nTo discuss the results, we have shown that the THz radiation can be concentrated to the \u223c 100 nm transverse\nsize in adiabatically graded plasmonic (metal/dielectric)\nwaveguides. In the optimum adiabatically-graded, coaxial waveguide, which consists of the initial cone terminated with a funnel, the radiation of a 1 THz frequency\nwhose wavelength is 300 \u03bcm, can be compressed to a\nspot of 250 nm radius, where its intensity increases by a\nfactor of \u00d7250. Even in the case of the extreme compression to a spot of the 100 nm radius, the THz intensity is\nenhanced by one order of magnitude with respect to the\ninitial intensity of the 300 \u03bcm spot at the entrance of the\nwaveguide. The physical process that limits the extent of\nthis spatial concentration is the skin effect, i.e., penetration of the radiation into the metal that causes the losses:\nthe THz field penetrates the depth of ls = 30 \u2212 60 nm of\nthe metal, which by the order of magnitude determines\nthe ultimum localization radius.\nThe THz nanoconcentration predicted in this Letter for optimally-graded adiabatic plasmonic waveguides\nprovides unique opportunities for THz science and technology, of which we will mention below just a few. The\nnanoconcentration of the THz radiation will provide the\nTHz ultramicroscopy with a THz source of unprecedented spatial resolution and brightness. The increase\nof the THz intensity by two orders of magnitude along\nwith the novel high-power THz sources11 would allow\nthe observation of a wide range of electronic and vibrational nonlinear effects in metal, semiconductors, insulators, and molecules.\nThese nonlinear THz phenomena can be used to investigate behavior of various materials in ultrastrong fields,\nfor nonlinear spectroscopy (including the multidimensional spectroscopy), and for monitoring and detection of\nvarious environmental, biological, and chemical objects\nand threats such as single bacterial spores and viruses.\nSuch applications will certainly be helped by very large\nabsorption cross sections of various materials in the THz\nregion. A distinct and significant advantage of the adiabatic nanofocusing is that the THz energy is mostly con-\n\n\f7\ncentrated in the hollow region of the waveguide, whose\nsize can be made comparable with the size of the objects\nof interest: in the range from 1 micron to 70 nm, which is\na typical range for bacteria and their spores, and viruses.\nThis will assure high sensitivity and low background for\nthe objects that are confined inside these waveguides.\nConsider as a specific example the spectroscopy or detection of single particles, such as, e.g., anthrax spores, in\nthe air. A sample containing the suspected nanoparticles\nin a gas, which can be air for the frequencies in the transparency windows, can be pumped through a THz waveguide, and the detection can be made for each particle in\nthe gas separately on the basis of the two-dimensional\nnonlinear THz spectra that are expected to be highly informative for the detection and elimination of the falsepositive alarms. Likewise, many other scientific, technological, environmental, and defense applications may\nbecome possible.\nI.\nA.\n\nMETHODS\n\nTerahertz TM Wave in Finite-Conductivity\nParallel Plate Waveguide\n\nA parallel plate waveguide supports an even TM mode\nwith wavenumber k, which satisfies the dispersion relation\n\u0010\u03ba a\u0011\n\u03b5 d \u03bam\nd\ntanh\n=\u2212\n(5)\n2\n\u03b5 m \u03bad\n\u00011/2\n\u00011/2\n.
