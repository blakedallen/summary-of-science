It would also enable more direct comparisons between solar and stellar soft X-ray\nspectra, a waveband in which (unusually) we currently have much better stellar data than we do\nof the Sun.\n1.\n\nThe Promise of X-Ray Microcalorimeters in Solar Physics\n\nCoronal heating has been the central problem of the solar outer atmosphere for over half\na century (e.g. Klimchuk 2006). The advent of high quality imaging data in the last 15 years\n(SOHO, TRACE, STEREO, Hinode, and now SDO) has forced the realization that the solar\natmosphere is significantly more dynamic and turbulent than had been previously appreciated.\nSince much of this behavior occurs on few seconds to minutes timescales, comparable to the integration time to record a spectrum or to scan a raster to make an image with grating instruments,\nwhat is ideally needed is an instrument capable of imaging spectroscopy, with high throughput,\nand high spatial and spectral resolution. In this respect, recent advances in microcalorimeter arrays for solar X-ray observations have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of coronal\nplasmas, specifically with regard to the non-equilibrium plasma dynamics of solar flares and active regions. The microcalorimeter is well-matched to the parameters of interest for detailed studies of the fundamental plasma physics in the Sun's atmosphere, with excellent spectral (<2 eV),\nspatial (~arcsec) and temporal (millisecond) scales and broad spectral coverage from 0.2 to 10\nkeV. Such an instrument will be able to:\n1.

Determine the abundances of elements from carbon to nickel relative to hydrogen\nThe simultaneous combination of high resolution spectroscopic imaging observations across\nthis entire energy range is new and tremendously powerful. Solar microcalorimeters will allow\nall of this information to be obtained simultaneously on time scales that allow us to follow the\nevolution of the radiative emission during the impulsive phase of flares. This is in contrast to the\nseveral minute cadence of previous instruments that sample only a narrow part of the spectrum\nand require rastering to build up images. The unique capabilities of these detectors will allow\nus to study how magnetic energy is released in magnetic reconnection events such as nano-flare\nheating in active regions, solar flares and, with different optics, coronal mass ejections with unprecedented spectral resolution.\nWith a 1-2 cm2 mirror and a thin Be filter, a typical active region or C flare region can be observed at full resolution. Gradual spectral resolution degradation will occur at increased incident\nflux.

Following Parker's (1988) initial suggestion, the idea that the corona is\nheated by short intense releases of energy, commonly known as \"nanoflares\" or \"microflares\" has\ngained currency. A number of indirect observations support this scenario. The scale heights of\ncoronal loops are clearly incompatible with static models. Recent models of the FIP effect1 where\nthe ponderomotive force from Alfv\u00e9n waves drives the fractionation (Laming 2004b; 2009) also\nstrongly suggest a coronal source for these waves, again more compatible with impulsive rather\nthan quasi-static coronal heating. Amidst this, the classical \"smoking gun\", the direct detection\nof hot plasma (with a low emission measure) signalling the location(s) of the heating event, has\nremained elusive.\nTantalizing hints are seen when the solar corona is imaged with Bragg Crystal SpectromThe coronal enhancement in abundance of elements with First Ionization Potential (FIP) less than about 10\neV, i.e. Mg, Si, Fe, over their photospheric values, while elements with higher FIP remain essentially unchanged.\n1\n\nScience with a X-ray Microcalorimeter White Paper\n\n3\n\n2010 Heliophysics Decadal Review\n\n\f105\n\nX-class Flare\n\nFe XXV\n1s2-1s2p\n\nFe XXV\n1s2-1s3p\n\nPhotons (counts/bin)\n\n104\n\n103\n\nFe XXIV\n3p sat.\nFe XXVI\n1s-2p\n\nNi XXVII\n+ sats.\n\n1 cm2, 3 sec, 1 eV bins\n1000 \uf06dm Be filter\nkT=2.32 keV\n\nFe XXV Fe XXV\n1s2-1s4p 1s2-1s5p\nFe XXIV Fe XXIV\n4p sat. 5p sat.\nFe XXV\n1s2-1s6p\n7p\n8p\n9p\n\n102\n\n101\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n8.0\nEnergy (keV)\n\n8.5\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Left: Theoretical solar flare spectrum, showing the Fe (6.7 keV) and Fe/Ni (8 keV) spectrum at\na few eV resolution.

On the other hand Warren et al. (2010)\nstudy the Hinode/EIS spectrum from the core of a solar active region and find no evidence for\nvery hot plasma which presents a challenge to the theory of nanoflares. The observational evidence to date all suffers from the use of either filter ratios with a broad band telescope, where\nlow temperature emission has to be corrected for, or the observation of an intrinsically weak\nsignal at low spatial resolution. The imaging capabilities of a microcalorimeter array, combined\nwith its broad bandpass and dynamic range, will allow detection of small admixtures of recentlyheated plasma in a region otherwise dominated by cooler material.\nFig. 1 shows two views of a simulated single pixel calorimeter spectrum of a solar active\nregion. The imaged emission measure is 4\u00d71038 cm\u22123 at 2\u00d7106K, with a small contribution 4\u00d71036\ncm\u22123 at 107 K, to model the anticipated nanoflare component. The left panel shows the broad\nband 0.5-1.3 keV region. The right panel shows a blow-up of the 0.95-1.15 keV region, and the\nnumber of hot lines (Fe XVII, XVIII, XX, XXI, XXIII) that immediately become visible. Outside this region the Mg XII 8.42\u00c5 Lyman \u03b1 transition already used (Zhitnik et al. 2006, Urnov et\nal. 2007) becomes available, along with other He- and H-like systems.\nThe microcalorimeter resolution < 2 eV means that Lyman \u03b1 from H-like ions Mg XII and up\nwill be resolved, and the intensity ratio between the two components will be measurable. Several of these ratios varying from 2:1 have been previously detected by instruments on solar flare\n2\nLines from hot plasma also appear in the EUV, but are weak and difficult to isolate from other emission from\nlower temperatures.\n\nScience with a X-ray Microcalorimeter White Paper\n\n4\n\n2010 Heliophysics Decadal Review\n\n\fmissions (P78-1, Solar Maximum Mission, Hinotori, all without any imaging or other context\ninstrumentation), and generally interpreted as due to effects of radiation transfer in an asymmetrical plasma, such that lines with higher opacity escape preferentially in one direction; we\nnote this is easily tested with a calorimeter via observations of higher Lyman series lines. Laming (1990) suggested that an alternative explanation could lie with directed electrons, presumably\naccelerated along the magnetic field direction, which impart some polarization to the levels they\nexcite. Upon radiative decay, the polarized light is naturally emitted in an anisotropic fashion,\ngiving rise to different Lyman \u03b1 intensity ratio for different angles of observation with respect\nto the \"beam\" axis. The relaxation time of ~keV electrons in coronal plasma is sufficiently short\nto make this unlikely in the case of a flare produced electron beam; the suprathermal electrons\nwould have to be continuously replenished, however a nanoflare model of coronal heating might\nbe expected to yield just such a signature, especially if the heating events are associated with\nsmall scale magnetic reconnection.\nAccompanying the energy release in the corona by nanoflares should be episodes of evaporation from the chromosphere, following heat conduction downwards. This upflow is predicted to\nbe 50-100 km s\u22121, i.e. detectable with the microcalorimeter. To date, such upflows have generally\nonly been convincingly detected during the impulsive phase of solar flares (e.g. Milligan et al.\n2006ab) as a \"shoulder\" on the blue wing of an otherwise stationary line profile.

(1999) see an upflow of 50 km s\u22121 during the late gradual flare phase, through the shift of the\nentire line profile.\n3.\n\nSOLAR FLARES\n\nSolar flares have traditionally been observed with Bragg Crystal Spectrometers flown on\nmissions at solar maximum around 1980 (P78-1, Solar Maximum Mission, Hinotori) and again\naround 1991 (Yohkoh). The microcalorimeter brings all of the attributes of these missions together with broad bandpass and X-ray imaging. The higher throughput compared to earlier missions\nwill allow observations of the early and preflare stage of the event, before the hard X-ray burst.\nBattaglia et al. (2009) argue that this early emission stems from conduction-driven chromospheric evaporation following heating in the corona. With a spectral resolution of < 2 eV, the thermal\nDoppler widths of Fe lines in evaporating plasma would be easily resolved; most likely there is\nalways also a \"non-thermal\" or turbulent component to the line width but it appears to be < 2 eV,\nfrom SMM BCS spectra of the main phase of flares (it is much larger at the flare impulsive stage,\ne.g. Alexander et al. 1998).\nDuring this phase it would also be key to look for non-ionization equilibrium effects through\nline ratios in particularly the 6.7 keV Fe line complex which is made up of He-like Fe (Fe XXV)\nlines (resonance, intercombination, forbidden) and Fe XXIV and lower ionization stage dielectronic satellites. Intensity ratios of satellites formed by dielectronic recombination and the resonance line give electron temperature, those formed by inner-shell excitation give the Li-like/\nHe-like Fe ion abundance ratio. If there is ionization equilibrium, the temperatures from the two\nratios should be equal but non-equality would indicate either an ionizing or recombining plasma.\nFig. 2 shows a simulated spectrum from one calorimeter pixel of a C class flare, obtained in 3 sec\nintegration.\nThe 6.7 keV \"Fe line\" complex consists of many closely spaced lines. However, the higherexcitation 8 keV \"Fe/Ni line\" feature (see Phillips 2004), consisting mostly of Fe XXV 1s2 \u2212\n1snp lines (n = 3,4,5...) and satellites which crowd together to form single spectral features, is\nScience with a X-ray Microcalorimeter White Paper\n\n5\n\n2010 Heliophysics Decadal Review\n\n\feasier to resolve, and would therefore be sensitive to lower upflow velocities. This feature has\nbeen observed with solid-state detectors (e.g. on the NEAR spacecraft, resolution ~600 eV) and\nwith RHESSI (1 keV resolution) but never with crystal spectrometers, in space or in the laboratory. The left panel of Fig. 3 shows a simulation of this spectral region. Ratios of satellites/parent\n(Fe XXV) lines give electron temperatures and possibly departures from thermal distributions.\nEvidence exists for high (approaching 1012\u20131013 cm-3) electron densities in solar flares (Phillips et\nal. 1996), using diagnostic line ratios in Fe XXI and Fe XXII observed with crystal spectrometers\non SMM. The microcalorimeter would provide similar spectral resolution, but with significantly\nhigher bandpass, throughput and spatial resolution. Hence the spatial variation of several different density diagnostic line ratios could be evaluated, with potentially important consequences for\nour understanding of the physics of solar flares.\n4.\n\nOff-Limb Observations of CMEs and the Solar Wind\n\nOff-limb solar observations will be perhaps where the combination of microcalorimeter attributes finds its optimum application. Observations of disk flares have revealed large blue shifts\nat onset in 107 K plasma (Innes et al. 2001, Innes et al. 2003), reaching as high as 650 - 1000\nkm s\u22121. These velocities are similar to the Alfv\u00e9n speed expected, and so could be the Alfv\u00e9nic\noutflow from the reconnection region, or due to turbulence. Off limb current sheets have been\nimaged with Hinode/XRT (Savage et al. 2010), and modeled (Reeves et al. 2010). Abundances\nhave been previously measured in CME current sheets (Ciaravella et al. 2002, Ko et al. 2003),\nwith the result that the FIP effect is present and strong. Microcalorimeter observations should\nmake substantial progress on outstanding unsolved issues surrounding magnetic reconnection;\nthe partitioning of energy between thermal energies of electrons and ions, bulk kinetic energy\nand turbulence.\nEvidence is also mounting that CMEs must be heated as they erupt, and that this heating represents a significant fraction of the CME energy budget. Analyses of ion charge states detected in\nsitu (Rakowski et al. 2007), and of remotely sensed UV emission (Akmal et al. 2001; Ciaravella\net al. 2001; Lee et al. 2009; Landi et al. 2010) reveal that previously cold (i.e. ~106 K coronal\nmaterial or cooler) is heated to temperatures approaching 107 K as the filament erupts, and microcalorimeter observations ought to be able to detect such hot emission.\nThe shock wave driven ahead of the CME would also make an interesting target. Spectroscopic diagnostics exist within the calorimeter bandpass for the measurement of postshock\nelectron temperature (the \"G\" ratio of He-like C V, N VI, O VII, etc). Ion temperatures can be\nmeasured from the line broadening, especially for shocks approaching 1000 km s\u22121. The derived\nelectron and ion internal energies should add up to the total shock energy (derived from kinematics), unless significant energy is being lost to the acceleration of solar energetic particles.\nThere is also evidence that the fast solar wind is heated in the region between about 1.5 and\n5 R\uf0a4 heliocentric distance where it is accelerated, from analyses of ion charge states collected\nin situ (Laming 2004a, Laming & Lepri 2007) and the observations of optical and near IR lines\nfrom different Fe charge states during eclipses (Habbal et al. 2007; 2010). A microcalorimeter\nshould be able to detect C V, VI, N VI, VII, and O VII, VIII in this region as confirmation of\nthese inferences, and to compare with in situ observations. Although the electron temperature in\nthis region may be as high as a few \u00d7106 K, Fe charges remain those of M-shell ions, because\nionization equilibrium is rapidly lost in the low-density solar wind plasma.\nScience with a X-ray Microcalorimeter White Paper\n\n6\n\n2010 Heliophysics Decadal Review\n\n\f5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWhile great progress has been made from X-ray imaging and UV and EUV imaging/spectroscopy, in the next decade we should return to the natural spectral band - the X-ray band -\nfor studying high energy coronal phenomena in detail. This offers potentially decisive contributions to the emerging nanoflare model of coronal heating, through the detection of hot plasma\nassociated with the heating. The microcalorimeter is also ideally suited to observations off-limb,\nand appears poised to advance this new field as well. The combination of spectral, spatial and\ntemporal resolution over a broad spectral band afforded simultaneously by the microcalorimeter\noffers a major advance in diagnostic capability. Current instruments generally give either spatial or temporal resolution, and then over a relatively narrow spectral bandpass if high spectral\nresolution is required. The broad bandpass will also allow the acquisition of solar spectra that are\nmuch more comparable to stellar X-ray spectra returned by instruments on satellites like Chandra\nand XMM-Newton. Currently, we are in the unusual situation of having better stellar spectra in\nthis spectral region than we do of the Sun (Osten 2010); a microcalorimeter will redress this mismatch, enabling direct comparisons with stellar observations in addition to addressing the issues\nin solar physics discussed above.\n\n6.\n\nReferences\n\n[19] Landi, E., Raymond, J.
