Observations of Type Ic supernovae in association with long GRBs provide a direct confirmation\n1\n\nPrinceton University Observatory, Peyton Hall, Ivy Lane, Princeton, NJ 08544\n\n2\n\nObservatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 813 Santa Barbara Street, Pasadena, CA 91101\n\n3\n\nHubble Fellow\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nthat they arise from the death of massive stars (Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek et al. 2003). Short\nGRBs, on the other hand, have long been suspected to arise from the merger of neutron star\nand/or black hole binaries (NS-NS, NS-BH; e.g., Eichler et al. 1989; Narayan et al. 1992;\nRosswog & Ramirez-Ruiz 2002; Aloy et al. 2005). During the last year, follow-up observations of Swift and HETE-2 short GRBs have provided initial confirmation to this idea, based\nin particular on the localization of some short GRBs to elliptical galaxies (Berger et al. 2005;\nGehrels et al. 2005; Bloom et al. 2006a), their lack of association with bright supernovae\n(Fox et al. 2005; Hjorth et al. 2005; Soderberg et al. 2006), and their lower energy release\nand wider beaming angles compared to long GRBs (Burrows et al. 2006; Soderberg et al.\n2006).\nDespite this observational progress we are still missing a clear understanding of the\nprogenitor population, due to the lack of direct observations (circumburst chemical abundances, gravitational waves, or a sub-relativistic, radioactive component: Li & Paczy\u0144ski\n1998; Kulkarni 2005). Thus, statistical studies of the burst properties can be highly effective in understanding their progenitor population(s) (e.g., Gal-Yam et al. 2005; Nakar et al.\n2005; Guetta & Piran 2006). Recently, Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006) investigated the ratio\nof short GRBs in early- and late-type galaxies as a constraint on the age distribution of\nthe progenitors. Their analysis combines the global star formation rate in each galaxy type\nwith a local galaxy stellar mass function, assuming the formation process of short GRB\nprogenitors does not depend on any other physical parameters. Since each galaxy type has\nexperienced a globally different star formation history, the ratio of bursts in each type is\npredicted to vary as a function of the progenitor age distribution.\nA complementary way to constrain the progenitor age distribution is to use the rates of\nshort GRBs in clusters and the field (Berger et al. 2006b; hereafter Paper I). This approach\ntakes advantage of the following differences between cluster and field environment. First, the\ngalaxy stellar mass function of clusters is more heavily dominated by massive galaxies than in\nthe field (Croton et al. 2005; Baldry et al. 2006). Since the star formation history is mainly\ndetermined by galaxy mass, the overall growth of stellar mass is in turn affected by the largescale environment. Second, the fraction of early-type galaxies is larger in clusters than in\nthe field (Dressler 1980; Whitmore et al. 1993; Baldry et al. 2006). Finally, there appears to\nbe a systematic offset in the star formation histories of cluster and field early-type galaxies\nof \u223c 1 \u2212 3 Gyr (e.g., Bernardi et al. 1998; Kuntschner et al. 2002; Thomas et al. 2005).\nThese effects lead to an overall difference in cluster and field star formation histories, which\ncombined with the progenitor age distribution, is expected to affect the relative fraction of\nshort GRBs in each environment.\nIn this paper we quantify these effects and show how the ratio of short GRBs in cluster\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand field early-type galaxies can be used to understand the age distribution of the progenitors.\nThis is part of our on-going systematic study of galaxy clusters hosting short GRBs, using\nmulti-slit optical spectroscopy and X-ray observations (Paper I). We find that the current\nobservations, albeit with a small number of events, favor P (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 n with n \u223c 0 \u2212 1. Finally,\nwe provide a comparison of the systematic effects in this approach and the approach of\nZheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006).\n\n2.\n\nThe Rate of Short Bursts in Clusters and the Field\n\nThe approach used by Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006) can be generalized to formulate\nthe short GRB rate per unit volume in cluster and field early-type galaxies at z \u223c 0, using\nthe star formation history function, SFH(\u03c4 ) instead of a star formation rate function:\nRi = C\n\nZ\n\nt(z=\u221e)\n\nSFHi (\u03c4 ) P (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4.\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nHere \u03c4 is both the look-back time and the time delay of a short GRB progenitor, and i\ndesignates a cluster or field environment. P (\u03c4 ) represents the time delay probability distribution of the progenitors with a normalization constant C. In the context of NS-NS or\nNS-BH mergers we adopt the standard power-law form, P (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 n . We note that NS-NS\nbinaries in the Milky Way appear to follow P (\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 \u22121 (Champion et al. 2004). It is thus\nthe convolution of P (\u03c4 ) with SFH(\u03c4 ) that determines the relative rate of short GRBs in\ncluster and field early-type galaxies.\nSince the star formation history of early-type galaxies is determined by both the mass\nand environment of a galaxy, the total star formation history of each environment can be\ndescribed in the following manner:\nZ Mu\nSFHi (\u03c4 ) =\n\u03c6i (M) SFHgal,i (\u03c4, M) dM,\n(2)\nMl\n\nwhere \u03c6i (M) is the galaxy number density function, SFHgal,i (\u03c4, M) is the star formation\nhistory function of a single galaxy that has a stellar mass, M, and Mu and Ml are the\nappropriate upper and lower mass integration limits (see \u00a73).\nFrom SDSS observations, it has been determined that the galaxy number density is well\ndescribed by a double Schechter function (Baldry et al. 2006):\n\u03c6(M)dM = e\u2212M/M [\u03c6\u22171 (M/M \u2217 )\u03b11 + \u03c6\u22172 (M/M \u2217 )\u03b12 ]\n\u2217\n\ndM\n,\nM\u2217\n\n(3)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwhere the parameters log M \u2217 , \u03c6\u22171 , \u03b11 , \u03c6\u22172 and \u03b12 for a cluster environment (log \u03a3 \u223c 1.3) are\n11.06, 0.74, \u22121.09, 0.07, and \u22121.5, and for a field environment (log \u03a3 \u223c \u22120.9) they are 10.44,\n2.7, \u22120.2, 0.8, and \u22121.5 (Baldry et al. 2006). Here, \u03a3 is the projected density of neighboring\ngalaxies, and the specific values are determined from a sample of \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 105 galaxies in the\nredshift range 0.01 \u2212 0.085 in the SDSS Data Release Four (Baldry et al. 2006).\nWe are here only interested in the rates of short GRBs in early-type galaxies, whose\nstar formation history is better understood than those of late-type galaxies, and in order to\navoid any systematic differences between progenitors in late- and early-type host galaxies.\nWe therefore need to modify \u03c6(M) by the fraction of early-type galaxies in each environment\n(Baldry et al. 2006):\nfr,i (\u03a3, M) = 1 \u2212 exp{\u2212[(\u03a3/b1 )b2 + (M/b3 )b4 ]},\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the values of the parameters b1 , b2 , b3 , and b4 are 100.91 Mpc\u22122 , 0.69, 1010.72 M\u2299 ,\nand 0.59. Thus, \u03c6i (M) = \u03c6(M)fr,i (\u03a3, M). In a cluster environment, with a higher \u03a3\nand systematically larger masses, the early-type fraction is larger than in the field. A plot\nof fr \u03c6(M) for cluster and field environments is shown in Figure 1a. Clearly, the most\nmassive galaxies reside preferentially in clusters, while the bulk of the mass in galaxies with\nM . 1010.5 is in the field.\nFinally, we turn to the star formation history function, SFHgal (\u03c4, M). Early-type galaxies in different environments show different star formation histories for a given galaxy mass\n(Kuntschner et al. 2002; Thomas et al. 2005; De Lucia et al. 2006; Schawinski et al. 2006).\nMoreover, the star formation history is also determined by the galaxy mass. Following\nThomas et al. (2005), we use a Gaussian form for the star formation history:\nSFHgal (\u03c4, M) = \u221a\n\nM\n(\u03c4 \u2212 tpeak )2\n],\nexp[\u2212\n2(\u2206t)2\n2\u03c0\u2206t\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the peak of the star formation history function, tpeak , is determined by both the\nmass of a galaxy and its environment (Equations 2 and 3 of Thomas et al. 2005), and \u2206t is\ndetermined by the mass of a galaxy. Here, we assume that the low-density environment of\nThomas et al. (2005) corresponds to the field, while clusters correspond to the high-density\nenvironment1 . The overall trend is that less massive galaxies form their stars later (i.e.,\nsmaller tpeak ) and over a wider timescale (i.e., larger \u2206t). In addition, tpeak in clusters is\nsystematically larger than in the field. These effects are shown in Figure 1b, where we plot\nthe star formation histories of galaxies with 108 , 109 , 1010 , and 1011 M\u2299 in both environments.\n1\n\nFollowing Thomas et al. (2005) we adopt the following cosmological parameters: \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7,\nand H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe final ingredient is the overall normalization of Equation 3. In its current form this\nequation was normalized to a total mass of 1010 M\u2299 for each environment by Baldry et al.\n(2006). Since we are interested in the overall rate per unit volume, we therefore need to know\nwhat fraction of the stellar mass is in clusters versus the field at z \u223c 0. From the study of\nBaldry et al. (2006), as well as Fukugita et al. (1998) and Eke et al. (2005), it appears that\nabout 20% of the total stellar mass is included in cluster environments2 , which we adopt\nhere.\n\n3.\n\nConstraints on the Age Distribution of Short GRB Progenitors\n\nTo illustrate the combined effect of the trends discussed in the previous section we begin\nby making the simplified assumption that there is a single typical galaxy mass, Mtyp , for\neach environment. This typical mass in turn determines the typical star formation history\nof each environment. In this scenario, Equation 2 can be simplified as:\nSFHi (\u03c4 ) = \u03c6i (Mtyp ) \u00d7 SFHgal,i (\u03c4, Mtyp ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhile Mtyp is determined by (Baldry et al. 2006):\nlog (Mtyp ) = 10.73 + 0.15log \u03a3.\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore, Mtyp is \u223c 1010.6 M\u2299 and \u223c 1010.9 M\u2299 for field and cluster environments, respectively.\nWe are now in a position to use Equations 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to predict the relative rate\nof short GRBs in cluster and field early-type galaxies. The result as a function of the power\nlaw index n is shown in Figure 2. We note that the absolute scale in this plot is irrelevant\nsince we did not integrate over the full mass function, but it provides insight into the overall\ntrend. Namely, as n increases, i.e., as the distribution is more heavily weighted to older\nprogenitors, the fraction of short GRBs in clusters increases. This can be understood as the\ncombined effect of a systematically earlier star formation episode and a higher typical mass\nin clusters.\nA quantitative determination of the relative rates requires a full integration of Equation 2. The results of this integration are shown in Figure 3. Overall, the dependence of the\nratio of short GRBs in clusters and the field on n is similar to the one found in the simple\n2\n\nThis corresponds to the assumption that cluster environments can be described by log \u03a3 & 0.5; see\nAppendix A of Baldry et al. (2006) for details.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ncase. However, the integration over the full mass function of each environment brings out\nadditional trends. For a low mass cutoff smaller than 1010 M\u2299 , there is sharp downturn in\nthe ratio for n . \u22121. This can be understood from the plots of SFHgal (\u03c4 ) \u00d7 P (\u03c4 ) shown in\nFigures 1c and 1d. In particular, for n = \u22122 the short GRB rate in the field is larger than in\nclusters since the field has a higher abundance of low mass (. 1010 M\u2299 ) early-type galaxies\n(Figure 1a), which have young or intermediate stellar populations. For such low values of n\nthe ratio is sensitive primarily to recent star formation. We note that the same effect is seen\nin the analysis of Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006) for the ratio of early- to late-type hosts.\nIn this context (n . \u22121) the lower mass cutoff in Equation 2 plays an important role.\nIn Figure 3 we show the effect of setting Ml = 108 , 109 , and 1010 M\u2299 . As noted above, for\nMl = 1010 M\u2299 we do not see an obvious downturn because galaxies above this limit do not\nexhibit any obvious recent star formation activity. For the lower values of Ml , we find that\nthe largest downturn is for Ml = 109 M\u2299 . The reason for this is evident in Figure 1a, which\nshows that the largest difference between the field and cluster mass functions is at M & 109\nM\u2299 . At lower masses the mass functions converge, leading to a ratio that is \u223c 1.\nFor n & \u22121, on the other hand, the rate is dominated by the oldest, and hence most\nmassive galaxies (Figure 1d). In this case the ratio does not depend on Ml , and the predominance of massive galaxies in clusters, along with the systematically earlier star formation\nepisodes, results in an increased fraction of short GRBs in clusters for larger n. In fact, for\nn = 2, we find that there are three times as many short GRBs in cluster early-type galaxies\nas there are in field early-type galaxies.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe now turn to a comparison of our model with observation of short GRBs. To date\ntwo short bursts have been localized to clusters at z \u223c 0.2: GRB 050509b (Gehrels et al.\n2005; Bloom et al. 2006a) and GRB 050911 (Paper1). We note that in the latter case the\nlarge error circle prevents an association with a specific cluster galaxy, but the large earlytype fraction of 80% (Berger et al. 2006b) suggests that the burst was likely hosted by an\nearly-type galaxy. On the other hand, only one short GRB has been localized to a field\nearly-type galaxy, GRB 050724 (Berger et al. 2005). We do not consider GRB 050813, which\nwas hosted by a cluster at a much higher redshift (z \u223c 1.8; Berger 2006a), and GRB 060502b,\nwhich may be hosted by an early-type galaxy (Bloom et al. 2006b), but whose large-scale\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nenvironment has not been fully explored yet3 . Thus, the current ratio of short GRBs in\ncluster versus field early-type galaxies is about 2 : 1, with a large uncertainty due to the\nsmall number of events. From Figure 3, we find that this ratio corresponds to n \u223c 0 \u2212 1.\nThis value is lower than n & 3/2 claimed by Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006), but is in rough\nagreement with \u22121 . n . 0 found by Berger et al. (2006c) based on their revised redshift\ndistribution with 1/4 \u2212 2/3 of all short GRBs at z & 1.\nClearly, in both methods of estimating the age of short GRB progenitors the uncertainty\nin the inferred value of n is currently dominated by the small number of bursts with a known\nredshift, host galaxy, and large-scale environment type. Since this uncertainty will eventually\ndiminish with a larger sample of events, it is interesting to consider systematic uncertainties\nin both theoretical approaches. Our analysis suffers from the somewhat poor definition of\ncluster and field environments. We have used an overall cluster mass fraction of 20%, as\nindicated by several researchers, but this number may range from 10 to 30%. Second, we\nhave used the simplified bimodal star formation history model of Thomas et al. (2005), but\nthese authors do not use the same quantitative definition of galaxy environment that was\nused for the mass functions by Baldry et al. (2006). Since we have used representative mass\nfunctions, and then scaled the results by the overall mass fraction in clusters and the field,\nthis effect should not be significant. Third, the uncertainty in the definition of field galaxy\nenvironment leads to an overall uncertainty of about 20% in our calculated ratio. Finally,\nsince for n . \u22121 the ratio depends on Ml , it is essential to understand the appropriate low\nmass limit for early-type galaxies. With the current inferred value of n \u223c 0 \u2212 1, however,\nthis may not be a relevant issue for short GRBs.\nSimilarly, the analysis of the short GRB rate in early- and late-type galaxies performed\nby Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz (2006) also suffers from systematic effects. First, the ratio is\naffected by the uncertain star formation history at high redshift when early-type galaxies\nformed most of their stars. Second, their estimation of star formation rate does not consider\nenvironmental effects that appear to be important in current observations from SDSS and\n2dF, and which we have accounted for here. Finally, as noted by Zheng & Ramirez-Ruiz\n(2006), it is possible that late-type galaxies have an altogether different age distribution of\nshort GRB progenitors than early-type galaxies. This problem is overcome by our method\nsince it considers only early-type host galaxies. We note that if both derivations are in fact\ncorrect, then the estimated values of n can be used to assess any systematic differences of\nshort GRB progenitors in early- and late-type galaxies, as suspected to exist for type Ia\n3\n\nThe limit on the X-ray luminosity at the redshift of the putative host galaxy, LX . 6 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ,\nis lower by a factor of eight than that of the cluster hosting GRB 050509b, but it is somewhat higher than\nthat of the cluster hosting GRB 050911 (Paper I).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsupernovae (Sullivan et al. 2006).\nFuture applications of our approach will include the effect of globular clusters, which\nare thought to provide an efficient environment for the production of NS-NS binaries, and\nmay account for a substantial fraction of all short GRB progenitors (Grindlay et al. 2006;\nHopman et al. 2006). We expect that since the specific frequency of globular clusters increases significantly with galaxy mass (Harris 1991), an association with globular clusters\nwill increase the fraction of short GRBs in galaxy clusters compared to the trend shown in\nFigure 3. Similarly, our approach can be extended to higher redshift to investigate the evolution in the fraction of short GRBs in clusters. We expect that the lack of strong evolution\nin the last several Gyr likely makes our analysis applicable out to z \u223c 1. However, if some\nshort GRBs are in fact associated with clusters at z \u223c 2, this presents an opportunity to\nassess any systematic changes in the value of n with redshift.\nWe end with the following conclusion. If our current estimate of n & 0 continues to be\nsupported by future observations, then this implies that the majority of short GRBs in earlytype galaxies will occur in clusters. This therefore suggests that short GRBs can provide an\nefficient tool for finding forming galaxy clusters at high redshift, as already appears to be the\ncase for GRB 050813 (Berger 2006a). Continued near-IR imaging and optical spectroscopic\nobservations of short GRB fields may therefore provide an efficient method for finding the\nhighest redshift clusters.\nWe thank I. K.
