We fit isothermal modified black bodies to the spectral energy distribution (SED) to extract the dust temperature of sources with\ncounterparts in Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) or SDSS surveys with either a spectroscopic or a photometric redshift. For a subsample of\n330 sources detected in at least three FIR bands with a significance greater than 3\u03c3, we find an average dust temperature of (28 \u00b1 8)K. For sources\nwith no known redshift, we populate the colour-colour diagram with a large number of SEDs generated with a broad range of dust temperatures\nand emissivity parameters, and compare to colours of observed sources to establish the redshift distribution of this sample. For another subsample\nof 1686 sources with fluxes above 35 mJy at 350 \u03bcm and detected at 250 and 500 \u03bcm with a significance greater than 3\u03c3, we find an average\nredshift of 2.2 \u00b1 0.6.\nKey words. submillimeter: galaxies - Galaxies: evolution - Galaxies: high-redshift\n\n1. Introduction\nThe total intensity of the extragalactic background light at farinfrared (FIR) wavelengths has been measured with absolute\nphotometry (Puget et al. 1996; Fixsen et al. 1998; Dwek et al.\n1998). Deep surveys are now starting to resolve the cosmic FIR\nbackground into discrete sources with the fraction resolved varying with wavelength (see reviews in Blain et al. 2002; Hauser &\nDwek 2001; Lagache et al. 2005, Dye et al. 2009). Despite some\nsuccesses, there are still large uncertainties about the nature and\nevolution of the submillimetre (submm) galaxy population, including their redshift distribution.\nThe Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey\n(H-ATLAS) is an open-time key program of the Herschel\nObservatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010) that will survey roughly 550\ndeg2 of sky over 600 hours of observations (Eales et al. 2010).\nTo cover the widest possible area, H-ATLAS uses the maximum\npossible scan rate for the telescope at 60 arcsec sec\u22121 in the parallel mode of PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010) and SPIRE (Griffin\net al. 2010). The observations cover five photometric bands with\n100 and 160 \u03bcm data from PACS, and 250, 350, and 500 \u03bcm data\nfrom SPIRE. The H-ATLAS fields include 1 field close to the\nnorthern Galactic pole (150 deg2 ), 3 fields (each 36 deg2 ) coin\u22c6\n\nHerschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments\nprovided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.\n\nciding with the GAMA redshift survey fields (Driver et al. 2009),\nand 2 fields (total area of 250 deg2 ) near the southern Galactic\npole.\nDuring the Science Demonstration Phase (SDP), H-ATLAS\nobserved 14.4 deg2 in the GAMA-9 hour field near the ecliptic\nplane to a 5\u03c3 depths of 35-90 mJy. In this Letter we present the\ncolour-colour diagrams derived from the five bands from 100 to\n500 \u03bcm for the H-ATLAS sources that are cross-identified in at\nleast 3 of the SPIRE and PACS bands. We then discuss the dust\ntemperature and redshift distributions based on certain assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) and subject to\nselection effects associated with the sample selection.\n\n2. Colour-colour diagrams\nWe use source catalogues generated for the H-ATLAS consortium by Rigby et al. (2010, in prep.), derived from SPIRE and\nPACS maps presented in Pascale et al. (2010, in prep.) and\nIbar et al. (2010, in prep.), respectively. The source catalogues\nare supplemented with cross-identification information from the\nGAMA survey (Driver et al. 2009) and SDSS DR-7 (Abazajian\net al. 2009) as described in Smith et al. (2010, in prep.). For\nthe sources for which spectroscopic redshifts from GAMA or\nSDSS are not available, we use photometric redshifts generated using the ANNz neural network code (Collister & Lahav\n2004), trained with photometry from SDSS and UKIDSS LAS\n\n\f2\n\nA.

Dust temperature as a function of redshift for 330 HATLAS sources reliably identified with GAMA and SDSS DR7 galaxies having a known spectroscopic (black filled triangle)\nor a photometric (black empty triangle) redshift. The selected\nsources are > 5\u03c3 detections in at least one band of either PACS\nor SPIRE with 3\u03c3 flux measurements in at least 2 more bands.\nThe isothermal spectral fits assume \u03b2 = 1.5. For other data plotted, see Section 3.\n\nFig. 1. Colour-colour diagram of SPIRE and PACS sources.\nThe coloured background indicates the average redshift in these\ncolour-colour spaces of our 106 randomly generated model\nSEDs. In (a) points plotted represent a sample of 1686 galaxies detected in all three SPIRE bands with a significance greater\nthan 5 \u03c3 at 350 \u03bcm (S > 35mJy) and greater than 3\u03c3 at 250 and\n500 \u03bcm (corresponding to flux limits of roughly 21 and 27 mJy,\nrespectively). In (b) we show a sample of 402 galaxies detected\nat 160, 250, and 350 \u03bcm and in (c) we show a sample of 158\ngalaxies detected at 100, 160, and 250 \u03bcm. As in (a), in both (b)\nand (c) we also select sources by imposing a 5\u03c3 cut in the central wavelength of the colour plot and greater than 3\u03c3 at other\nwavelengths.\n\n(Lawrence et al. 2007), and spectra from the GAMA spectroscopic survey (Driver et al 2009), DEEP2 (Davis et al. 2007),\n\nFig. 3. Dust temperature as a function of the FIR luminosity\nfor 330 H-ATLAS sources reliably identified with GAMA and\nSDSS DR-7 galaxies with a known spectroscopic (black filled\ntriangle) or a photometric (black empty triangle) redshift. The\nFIR luminosity is obtained by fitting the PACS and SPIRE measurements with a modified black body (parameters are the dust\ntemperature and the luminosity density, \u03b2 is fixed to 1.5) and this\nmodel SED is integrated between 8 and 1100 \u03bcm. We also indicate BLAST and H-ATLAS best-fit T d \u2212 log(LFIR ) relation with\na dashed blue line (from Dye et al. 2009) and a dashed red line,\nrespectively.\n\nzCOSMOS (Lilly et al. 2007), and the 2SLAQ-LRG (Cannon et\nal. 2006) survey.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the colour-colour plots of the H-ATLAS\nsources. We divide these plots in terms of colours based on either\nSPIRE only or SPIRE and PACS data. Our flux selection results\nin selecting 1686, 402, and 158 sources, from top to bottom of\n\n\fA. Amblard et al.: Colour-colour diagrams of Herschel-ATLAS sources\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. For reference, the total ATLAS catalogue for this field\ncontains \u223c 6600 sources (Rigby et al. 2010, in prep.).\nThe colour-colour plots are filled with 106 black-body spectra at a single dust temperature, T d , modified by a frequencydependent emissivity function \u01eb\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 , where the flux density f\u03bd\nis\n\u0012 h\u03bd \u0013\nf\u03bd = \u01eb\u03bd B\u03bd \u221d \u03bd3+\u03b2 /[exp\n\u2212 1].\n(1)\nkT d\nIn generating these models, we consider uniform ranges of dust\ntemperature from 10 to 60 K, emissivity parameter \u03b2 from 0 to\n2, and redshift from 0 to 5. The choice of 0 < \u03b2 < 2 compared to\n1 < \u03b2 < 2 makes a minor difference since we also broaden the\nSED tracks in the colour diagram by adding an extra Gaussian\nstandard deviation of 10% to the fluxes used to compute the\nmodel colour. This scatter accounts for the broadening of data in\nthe colour-colour plane caused by flux uncertainties. As shown\nin Fig. 1, we find that the colour diagram of sources with fluxes\nonly from SPIRE are well within the limits defined by the models we have considered. When we examine PACS colours, we\nfind that some points lie outside the same set of tracks as used\nfor the SPIRE-only colour diagram. While some of these outlier\npoints may be cause by either the fractionally larger flux errors\nof PACS or contamination from a neighboring source, it is possible that some of these sources are not accurately described by\nour simple isothermal SED model, requiring for instance a second dust component (Dunne & Eales 2001) or a more complex\nSED model.\nWhen fitting a simple modified black-body model to the data,\nwe must keep in mind that there is a partial degeneracy between\n\u03b2 and T d and, more importantly, a perfect degeneracy between\nT d and z. The peak of the SED is determined by the \u03bd/T d term in\nthe exponential, so that a measurement of the colours alone constrains only the ratio (1 + z)/T d . However, assuming reasonable\npriors on the free parameters of the SED model (in our case,\n\u03b2 and T d ) it is still possible to estimate a qualitative redshift\ndistribution for our sample of sources. Alternatively, if secure\nredshifts are known from optical cross-identifications, we can\ndetermine the dust temperatures.\n\n3. Dust temperature distribution\nWe consider the H-ATLAS source sample with detections at 3\u03c3\nin at least two bands and at 5\u03c3 in one band of either PACS and\nSPIRE that have been robustly (reliability parameter RLR > 0.9,\nSmith et al. 2010, in prep.) identified with GAMA or SDSS DR7 galaxies. We also require that there is a known spectroscopic\nredshift from either GAMA or SDSS, or from the photometric\nredshift catalog (with (1 + z)/\u03c3z > 5 and z/\u03c3z > 1) that was\ngenerated for this field and cross-identified with ATLAS sources\n(Smith et al. 2010, in prep.). We select 330 sources, which correspond to the low redshift subsample of the galaxies selected in\nthe colour-colour diagrams. For each galaxy, we perform a single temperature fit from the above equation assuming \u03b2 = 1.5.\nWe found that an isothermal SED model generally is a good fit to\nthe 330 galaxies. Fitting a two-component SED model does not,\non average, seem to provide a closer fit. The relatively good fit\nprovided by the isothermal SED model is probably due to most\nof our sample consisting of low redshift galaxies and therefore\nthat we do not probe much of the Wien part of the galaxy SED.\nIn Fig. 2, we summarize our results and compare the HATLAS dust temperatures with dust temperatures in the literature for a variety of sub-mm bright galaxies. These samples\nare: (i) the sources in BLAST detected above 5\u03c3 in at least\n\nFig. 4. Normalized redshift distribution (black thick solid line)\nof SPIRE sources in the colour-colour diagram of Fig. 1(a), selected to satisfy the following criteria: S 350 > 35mJy and at least\n3\u03c3 detections at 250 and 500 \u03bcm. The dashed line and dotteddash line represent Negrello et al. (2007) and Lagache et al.\n(2004) models for the same flux selection. Both model curves\nhave similar but not identical distributions, although Lagache\nmodel predicts a larger number of high-redshift galaxies. In addition, we show N(z) for the same subsample using a colour-cut\nof S 500 /S 250 < 0.75 (blue thin solid line), and > 0.75 (red thin\ndotted line). The distribution shown here is for 1686 sources, a\nsubset of about 6600 H-ATLAS sources in the SDP field.\none of the BLAST bands with either a COMBO-17 (Wolf et al.\n2004) or a SWIRE photometric redshift (Rowan-Robinson et al.\n2008) and Spitzer-MIPS 70 and 160 \u03bcm fluxes (Dye et al. 2009;\n\u03b2 = 1.5 fixed); (ii) local ULIRGS observed with SCUBA at 450\nand 850 \u03bcm and complemented with IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm fluxes\n(Clements et al. 2010; \u03b2 varied); (iii) SCUBA sub-mm galaxies\ndetected at better than 3\u03c3 at 850 \u03bcm and having redshifts determined from Keck-I spectroscopy (Chapman et al. 2005; \u03b2 = 1.5\nfixed); and (iv) local IRAS-selected galaxies with 60 and 100 \u03bcm\nfluxes complemented with SCUBA 850 \u03bcm (Dunne et al. 2000;\n\u03b2 varied).\nIn Table 1, we list average dust temperatures as a function\nof redshift for several bins in redshift for both H-ATLAS only\nand all of the combined sub-mm galaxy samples, including HATLAS, plotted in Fig. 2. We do not find any evolution in the HATLAS dust temperature with redshift, though some evolution\nis inferred by BLAST measurements (Dye et al. 2009; Pascale\net al. 2009), where sources at higher redshift had higher temperature in agreement with the radio-identified submillimeterselected galaxies (SMGs) found with SCUBA (Chapman et al.\n2005; Ivison et al. 2010; Kovacs et al. 2006; Coppin et al. 2008).\nWhile we find remarkable consistency between the average dust\ntemperatures for our H-ATLAS sample as a function of redshift,\nthese average values are not necessarily in agreement with other\nsub-mm galaxy subsamples in the literature, mostly due to selection effects. For example, the SCUBA ULIRGS have an average temperature of (43 \u00b1 7)K. These sources were selected using IRAS 60 \u03bcm data and IRAS selected sources are known to\nbe biased towards higher temperatures. Optically-selected lowredshift sub-mm galaxies are known to have colder temperatures\nconsistent with our findings (e.g., Willmer et al. 2009; Vlahakis\net al. 2005). The large expected sample of sources from the 550\ndeg.2 of H-ATLAS will enable more detailed studies in the future, without the biases associated with selections of various subsamples, including our own. While we show results here with\n\n\f4\n\nA. Amblard et al.: Colour-colour diagrams of Herschel-ATLAS sources\n\nTable 1.

(2000).\nIn Fig. 3, we plot the dust temperature versus FIR luminosity by integrating model SEDs between 8 and 1100 \u03bcm for\nthe H-ATLAS subsample. Luminosities for other samples are\nfrom the literature. Fitting for a relation of the form T d =\nT 0 + \u03b1 log(LFIR /L\u2299 ), we find T 0 = \u221220.5K and \u03b1 = 4.4 (see,\nFig. 4). The value of log(LFIR /L\u2299 ) is on average 10.9\u00b10.8 for our\nsample. This relation is consistent with the BLAST data (Dye et\nal. 2009).\n\n4. Redshift distribution\nSince most of our sources lack redshifts, we consider another\nexample application of our colour diagram and infer the statistical redshift distribution N(z) for the source samples plotted in\nFig. 1. We do this by first gridding the colour-colour plane along\nthe SED tracks into redshift bins. We then convert the number\nof sources within a grid region of colours to a binned redshift\ndistribution (Hughes et al. 2002). This method is equivalent to\nextracting the redshift probability distribution function for the\nwhole sample if we had simply fitted SEDs to individual fluxes\nand taken the sum of the redshift probabilities of each source.\nWhile the redshift for an individual galaxy is largely uncertain,\nand sensitive to the SEDs used, the statistical redshift distribution we extract should be a reasonable estimate of the true distribution of the source sample.\nFigure 4 shows the redshift distribution for SPIRE sources\ndetected in all 3 bands (Fig. 1(a)). For the sample of 1686\nsources with flux densities above 35 mJy at 350 \u03bcm and above\n3\u03c3 at 250 and 500 \u03bcm, we find the average redshift to be 2.2\u00b10.6.\nThis is consistent with the average redshift of 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 for the\nradio-identified sub-mm galaxies with SCUBA at 850 \u03bcm followed up spectroscopically at Keck (Chapman et al. 2005), the\ninterquartile redshift range of 1.8 to 3.1 for sources in SCUBA\nHalf Degree Extragalactic Survey determined photometrically\n(Aretxaga et al. 2007), and a median redshift of greater than 1\nfor a subsample of 250 \u03bcm sources as faint as 35 mJy (Dunlop\net al. 2009). Our distribution, however, has an average redshift\nthat is higher than that of a larger sample of BLAST sources\n(Dye et al. 2009). This difference is not unexpected given the\ndifferences in the sample selection. We emphasize again that\nthe distribution shown in Fig. 4 is for a subset of about 25%\nof the whole catalog with specific selection criteria that tend to\nfavour the high redshift-end of the distribution. Based on crossidentifications with SDSS and GAMA, we find that 30% of the\nH-ATLAS sources are at z < 0.5 in the SDP field (Smith et al.\n2010, in prep.).\nIn addition to the total sample, we also make a colour-cut\nwith S 500 /S 250 > 0.75 and < 0.75, in addition to the flux cut of\n35 mJy at 350\u03bcm. By imposing this colour-cut, we distinguish a\n\nhigh redshift population with redder colours from a low redshift\npopulation. We find average redshifts of 2.6\u00b10.3 and 1.8\u00b10.4 for\nsources with S 500 /S 250 > 0.75 and < 0.75, respectively. While\nwe do not show the redshift distributions separately for the samples in Figs. 1(b) and (c), the average redshift in these cases is\nz = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 for sources detected in 160, 250, and 350 \u03bcm with\na flux cut of 35 mJy at 250 \u03bcm, and z = 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 for sources\ndetected in 100, 160, and 250 \u03bcm with a flux cut of \u2243 100 mJy\nat 160 \u03bcm. As is clear from Fig. 1, we find that lower redshift\nsources are more likely to be detected at shorter wavelengths,\nwhile bright sources seen in longer SPIRE bands are likely to be\non average at high redshifts. Some of the bright 500 \u03bcm sources\nthat we detect, especially with a colour selection selecting red\ngalaxies in the sub-mm, may also have their fluxes magnified\nby lensing and will be among the results forthcoming from HATLAS (Negrello et al. 2010, in prep.).\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have discussed the spectral energy distribution of sub-mm\ngalaxies in a 14 deg.2 , subset of the full H-ATLAS survey. We\nhave used the colours in 5 bands to measure the dust temperature for the sub-sample of sources with known redshifts. We\nhave also derived a qualitative estimate of the statistical redshift\ndistribution of bright 350 \u03bcm selected galaxies assuming broad\npriors in temperature and the dust emissivity. We found that the\naverage dust temperature of H-ATLAS sources is 28 \u00b1 8K, while\n350 \u03bcm sources with fluxes above 35 mJy have an average redshift of 2.2 \u00b1 0.6.\nAcknowledgements.
