Besides,\ncombined with radial velocity measurements, it allows a precise measurement of the companion mass, and therefore, its mean density. This observational data are fundamental for\nthe development of models. New samples of transiting hot Jupiters should become available\nsoon (see, for example, Bord\u00e9 et al. 2003 (COROT); Alonso et al. 2004 and O'Donovan et al.\n2006a (TrES); Bakos et al. 2004 (HAT); Fischer et al. 2005 (N2K); Pollacco et al. 2006\n(WASP); McCullough et al. 2005 (XO); Aigrain et al. 2006 and Irwin et al. 2006 (Monitor);\nHolman et al. 2006 (TLC); Sahu et al. 2006 (SWEEPS)) but up to now the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) has provided the largest number of transiting candidates\n(Udalski et al. 2002a,b,c, 2003). In particular, Udalski et al. (2002b) discovered transits in\nthe I = 14.42 magnitude star OGLE-TR-113, located in the Carina region of the Milky\nWay disk, at RA(2000) = 10h 52m 24\u2032\u2032 .40, DEC(2000) = \u221261\u25e6 26\u2032 48\u2032\u2032 .5. They monitored 10\nindividual transits, measuring an amplitude \u2206I = 0.030 mag, and a period P = 1.43250\ndays.\nThe planetary nature of the transiting candidate OGLE-TR-113b was confirmed by\nBouchy et al. (2004) and Konacki et al. (2004) using high precision radial velocities measurements. The results are shown in Table 1 and confirm that OGLE-TR-113b can be classified as\na Very Hot Jupiter. Recently, Gillon et al. (2006) and Snellen & Covino (2006) presented R\nand K-band transit photometry, respectively. They obtain parameters in excellent agreement\nwith previous works. Additionally, Snellen & Covino (2006) report a tentative detection of\nemission from the planet.\n1\n\nBased on observations collected with the Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory (JMF and DM\nvisiting observers), and at the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla Observatory (SR, FP and DM\nvisiting observers) for the ESO Programmes 075.C-0427, 075.B-0414, and 076.C-0122.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThere are many difficulties to confirm real planets among the low amplitude transit\nobjects discovered by photometric transit searches. Most of the candidates turn out to\nbe grazing binaries, low mass stars, triples or blends (see, for example, Torres et al. 2005;\nPont et al. 2005; Mandushev et al. 2005; O'Donovan et al. 2006b). Furthermore, the red\nnoise sometimes causes false detections (Pont et al. 2006b). Therefore, real planets must\nbe confirmed with accurate radial velocities, which in the case of the OGLE candidates is\ndifficult because their magnitudes range from V = 15 to 18 and they are located in very\ncrowded fields.\nAnother test to check the real planetary nature of low amplitude transiting objects is to\nobserve their transits in different wavelengths. To first order, ignoring stellar limb darkening,\nthe transit amplitudes should be achromatic, i.e. they should be similar in the V, I, and\nKs -bands. Large amplitude differences would be indicative of blends.\nA triple system where a low mass star transits in front of a solar type star that is blended\nwith a foreground red star would give larger amplitudes in the Ks -band. On the other hand,\nif the blend is with an early type star in the foreground, the amplitudes would be larger\nin the V-band. Unfortunately, blends with foreground stars of similar color as the eclipsed\nstar would yield similar transit depths in all bands. In this sense, while multicolor transit\nphotometry can help to discriminate most impostors, it cannot be regarded as final proof of\nthe true nature of the planetary companion (see Moutou et al. 2005).\nTo second order, the multiple wavelength observations allow to test limb darkening\ncoefficients. This is so because the shapes of the transit light curves vary with wavelength\ndue to stellar limb darkening and to a possible planetary atmosphere (Burrows et al. 2000).\nWe have undertaken an observational project at the ESO telescopes at La Silla and\nParanal Observatories, to measure transit depths in the Ks and V-bands, to compare with\nthe OGLE I-band observations. In the first paper we presented optical photometry of the\nplanetary transit candidate OGLE-TR-109b (Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006, hereafter Paper I) .\nOther papers in the series discuss OGLE-TR-111 (Minniti et al. 2007) and OGLE-TR-82\n(Hoyer et al. 2007).\nIn this work we present new photometry covering a transit of OGLE-TR-113b in the Vband with the ESO VLT, and another transit in the Ks -band with the ESO NTT, improving\nthe measurements of the planetary parameters. The present observations allow to check\nindependently and to refine the ephemeris and amplitudes, and to determine variations on\nthe radius measurement using different photometric filters.\nThere is a fundamental difference in our observations with respect to OGLE. The OGLE\ncandidates have light curves made of several transits. While there are relatively few OGLE\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nI-band points per transit, the final phased light curves are very clean, and representative\nof an average transit. Our data show single transits but very well sampled. As such, they\ncould in principle be sensitive to large planetary satellites, for example (Charbonneau et al.\n2000a).\nThis paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present the infrared and optical\nobservations and photometry, respectively. Section 4 discusses the parameters of the target\nderived from the present observations. Finally, the conclusions are outlined in Section 5.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nIR Observations and Photometry\nIR Observations and Data Reduction\n\nOGLE-TR-113 was observed during the nights of May 4 and 5, 2005, using the SOFI\nIR camera and spectrograph at the ESO NTT. SOFI is equipped with a Hawaii HgCdTe\ndetector of 1024\u00d71024 pixels, characterized by a 5.4 e/ADU gain, a readout noise of 2.1\nADU and a dark current of less than 0.1 e/sec. We used it in the Large Field camera mode,\ngiving a 4.9 \u00d7 4.9 arcmin2 field. All measurements were made through the Ks -band filter\n(\u03bb0 = 2.162 \u03bcm and \u2206\u03bb = 0.275 \u03bcm). In Figure 1 we show a 12 \u00d7 12 arcsec2 portion of an\nimage acquired with SOFI.\nWe monitored several OGLE candidates (OGLE-TR-108, OGLE-TR-109, OGLE-TR113, OGLE-TR-170, and OGLE-TR-171), being in some cases limited by the weather (high\nwind and clouds). The telescope was slightly defocussed to avoid saturation of the detector\nfor the brightest stars. This does not affect the differential aperture photometry nor our\nfinal results.\nThe reductions were made using IRAF tasks 2 . First of all, the crosstalk correction was\napplied, taking into account the detectors sensitivity difference between the upper and lower\nhalf. Then the sky substraction was applied. The whole dataset was acquired using \"dither5\" around two offset positions that included the target. These contiguous sky images were\nused to generate local skies close in time for each of the offset images. Then the appropriately\nscaled skies were substracted from the images. Finally, we applied flat-field corrections to\nall images and aligned them. For the flat-fields, we used the correction images provided by\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Observatories, operated by Universities for Research in\nAstronomy, Inc.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe NTT SciOps team3 , and the alignment was done with lintran and imshift.\nThe calibration of the IR photometry was made using 2MASS. There were a dozen\nstars in common located in the OGLE-TR-113 field (not including this star because it is\nnot listed as a 2MASS source). Discarding outliers, we selected the 10 most isolated stars\nwith 12 < Ks < 14.5, obtaining RMSK = 0.03. The zero point of the Ks -band photometry\nshould be good to 0.1 mag, which is accurate enough for our purposes. We also checked this\ncalibration against the DENIS sources in the field, finding excellent agreement. Finally, we\nfind Ks = 13.0 \u00b1 0.1 and V \u2212 Ks = 3.5 \u00b1 0.1 for this star. The resulting light curve is shown\nin Figure 2.\n\n2.2.\n\nIR photometry\n\nStellar parameters\nBased on the high dispersion spectroscopy, Konacki et al. (2004) classify OGLE-TR-113\nas a K-type main sequence star with Teff = 4800\u00b1150 K, gravity log g = 4.5, and metallicity\n[Fe/H] = +0.0 dex. They estimate the star is located at a distance of about 600 pc. They\nadopt for this star a mass of M\u2217 = 0.79 \u00b1 0.06 M\u2299 , and a radius R\u2217 = 0.78 \u00b1 0.06 R\u2299 , very\nsimilar to the more recent values presented by Gillon et al. (2006), who used spectroscopic\nmeasurements to obtain the primary mass (M\u2217 = 0.78\u00b10.02 M\u2299 ), and R-band high precision\ntransit photometry to obtain the stellar radius (R\u2217 = 0.77\u00b10.02 R\u2299 ). Recently, Santos et al.\n(2006) derived similar stellar parameters for OGLE-TR-113: temperature Teff = 4804 \u00b1\n106 K, gravity log g = 4.52 \u00b1 0.26, metallicity [Fe/H] = +0.15 \u00b1 0.10 dex, based on high\ndispersion spectroscopy. They also derived the distance d = 553 pc, and an absorption\nAV = 0.42 based on the OGLE photometry. The values from these two independent studies\nagree within the uncertainties.\nWith the present optical and IR photometry we can confirm independently some of\nthese parameters: the spectral type, luminosity, mass, radius and distance.\nIn a previous work, we have used optical and infrared photometry to characterize OGLE\nextrasolar planetary companions using surface brightness analysis (Gallardo et al. 2005).\nUnfortunately, at the time we did not have Ks -band photometry of OGLE-TR-113. Following\nthe analysis described in that work, we obtained from the IR photometry surface brightness\nthe following stellar parameters: temperature Teff = 4396 \u00b1 50 K, radius R\u2217 = 0.81 \u00b1 0.05\n3\n\nwww.ls.eso.org/lasilla/sciops/ntt/sofi/reduction/flat fielding.html\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nR\u2299 , distance d = 550 \u00b1 30 pc, and reddening E(B\u2212V) = 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 mag (see Figure 3). In\nspite of the lower temperature, the distance and reddening are similar to those measured by\nSantos et al. (2006), and the radius is similar to that of Gillon et al. (2006). The determined\ndistance of 550 pc is consistent with the Ks -band photometry, making this the nearest known\nOGLE planet. This is also the smallest OGLE star with a confirmed planet.\nFigure 4 shows the optical and IR CMDs for the stars in a 1\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 field centered on\nOGLE-TR-113. The filled red square represents the extrasolar host star OGLE-TR-113.\nAdditionally, we show isochrones for solar age and metallicity for three different distances,\ncalculated using the value for colour excess and extinction determined above (J. Gallardo,\nprivate communication). The disk main sequence is very well defined, and the position of\nthe target star is consistent with a dwarf star, despite being apparently located away from\nthe main sequence, indicating that either this is a nearby K-dwarf, or a subgiant located\nfarther than the majority of the stars in this field. We prefer the first option based on the\nindependent evidence from the spectroscopy. For example, a K0V star has MKs = 3.9, and\na K5V star has MKs = 4.7 (Cox 2000). These give Ks = 12.8 and 13.6 for a distance of 600\npc, neglecting interstellar dust extinction.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nOptical Observations and Photometry\nOptical Observations and data reduction\n\nThe observations and photometry are described in detail in Paper I. Photometric observations were taken with VIMOS at the Unit Telescope 4 (UT4) of the European Southern\nObservatory Very Large Telescope (ESO VLT) at Paranal Observatory during the nights of\nApril 9 to 12, 2005. The VIMOS field of view consists of four CCDs, each covering 7\u00d78\narcmin, with a separation gap of 2 arcmin, and a pixel scale of 0.205 arcsec/pixel. Since the\nscope of the observations is to detect new transit candidates, we monitored four different\nfields. A number of OGLE transit candidates located in the observed fields were monitored\nsimultaneously. OGLE-TR-113 happened to have a transit towards the end of the second\nnight of our run.\nClearly, there exists a compromise between the temporal resolution of the observations\nand the number of fields monitored. The observations presented here were carried out alternating between two different fields, observing three 15 sec exposures on each one. For\nthis program we managed to reduce the observation overheads for telescope presets, instrument setups, and the telescope active optics configuration to an absolute minimum. This\nensured adequate sampling of the transit providing at the same time > 10000 stars with\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n15 < V < 19 for which lightcurves can be obtained. If individual candidates are to be\nobserved a much better temporal resolution can be achieved using other telescopes or instruments (see Gillon et al. (2006) for an example of high-temporal resolution observations\nwith NTT/SUSI and Pont et al. (2006a) for observations of OGLE-TR-10 and OGLE-TR-56\nacquired with VLT/FORS.) We obtained 150 points in the field of OGLE-TR-113 during\nthe second night. The observations lasted for about 9.5 hours, until the field went below 3\nairmasses.\nWe used the Bessell V filter of VIMOS, with \u03bb0 = 5460 \u00c5, FWHM = 890 \u00c5. The V-band\nwas chosen in order to complement the OGLE light curves which are made with the I-band\nfilter. In addition, the V-band is more sensitive to the effects of limb darkening during the\ntransit, and is adequate for the modeling of the transit parameters.\nFigure 5 shows a 12 \u00d7 12 arcsec2 portion of a 0.6 arcsec seeing image, illustrating that\nthe candidate star is unblended. There are a V = 16.0 mag star 2 arcsec East and a V = 17.5\nstar 2 arcsec West of our target. These do not affect our photometry.\n\n3.2.\n\nV-band transit photometry\n\nIn order to reduce the analysis time of the vast dataset acquired with VIMOS, the images\nof OGLE-TR-113 analyzed here are 400\u00d7400 pix, or 80 arcsec on a side. Each of these small\nimages contains about 500 stars with 15 < V < 24 that can be used by the software ISIS\nfor the differential photometry, and in the light curve analysis. The best seeing images\n(FWHM = 0.6 arcsec) taken near the zenith were selected, and a master image was made\nin order to serve as reference for the difference image analysis (see Alard & Lupton 1998;\nAlard 2000).\nThe seeing, position of the stars, peak counts, and sky counts were monitored. The individual light curves were checked against these parameters in search for systematic effects.\nExtensive tests with the difference image photometry were performed, varying different photometric parameters and choosing different sets of reference stars. The software gives relative\nfluxes that are dependent on the reference stars used, so that the final amplitude was measured using aperture photometry in the individual images. To do this we selected three\nimages centered on the transit and three images before the transit acquired with similar\nseeing but different airmass. Following this procedure we believe that the measurement of\nthe transit amplitude is reliable.\nThe photometry of OGLE-TR-113, with mean V = 16.08 gives RMSV = 0.0015 to\n0.0024 mag throughout the second night of the run. This quantity is found to correlate\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nmostly with the sizes of the point sources, given by a combination of seeing and airmass.\nTherefore, the photometric scatter increased for the end of the night, when the transit\noccurred (see Figure 6).\nFigure 7 shows the full light curve for the second night of observations, when the OGLETR-113 transit was monitored. For comparison we also show the phased light curve of the\nOGLE I-band photometry (in a similar scale) in the same Figure. The transit is well sampled\nin the V-band, and the scatter is smaller. There are Nt = 30 points in our single transit,\nshown in Figure 8. The minimum is well sampled, allowing us to measure an accurate\namplitude. In the case of OGLE, the significance of the transits is \u2013in part\u2013 judged by the\nnumber of transits detected. In the case of the present study, we compute the signal-to-noise\nof the single, well sampled transit. For a given photometric precision of a single measurement\nof \u03c3p and a transit depth \u2206V, this signal-to-noise transit is S/N = Nt 1/2 \u2206V/\u03c3p (Gaudi 2005).\nFor OGLE-TR-113 we find the S/N of this transit to be S/N \u2248 76 using \u2206V = 0.025 and\n\u03c3p = 0.0018.\nThe resulting light curve was corrected for a linear trend and phased adopting a period\nof P = 1.4324758 days from Konacki et al. (2004). The curve was fitted using transit curves\ncomputed with the algorithms of Mandel & Agol (2002). The curves depend on the ratio\nbetween the planetary and the stellar radii, the ratio between orbit radius and stellar radius,\nthe inclination angle and the coefficients of the limb darkening model chosen. All parameters\nwere fitted simultaneously, with a quadratic model for the limb darkening. We found that\nwithin the errors the limb darkening coefficients remain the same as those presented by\nClaret (2000) (u1 = 0.73, u2 = 0.092) for the stellar parameters, which were also employed\nby Gillon et al. (2006): Teff = 4750K, metallicity [M/H] = 0.0, surface gravity log g = 4.5\nand microturbulence velocity \u03bet = 1.0 km/s. Therefore, the coefficients were fixed at those\nvalues in order to minimize computation time. The best fit to the transit is shown in Figure 8\nas a solid line.\nThe uncertainties of the fit parameters were estimated from the \u03c72 hypersurface. In the\ncase of non-linear model fitting like this it is customary to obtain the parameters errors from\nthe intersection of the \u03c72 hypersurface with a constant hyperplane defined by \u03c72 = \u03c7bf + 1,\nwhere \u03c7bf is the value of \u03c72 associated with the best fit. However, as shown by Pont et al.\n(2006b), the existence of correlation between the observations produces a low-frequency noise\nwhich must be considered to obtain a realistic estimation of the uncertainties. To model the\ncovariance we followed Gillon et al. (2006) and obtained an estimate of the systematic errors\nin our observations from the residuals of the light curve. The amplitude of the white (\u03c3w )\nand red (\u03c3r ) noise can be obtained by solving the following system of equations:\n\u03c312 = \u03c3w2 + \u03c3r2\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\u03c382 =\n\n\u03c3w2\n+ \u03c3r2 ,\n8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c31 is the standard deviation taken over single residual points and \u03c38 is the standard\ndeviation taken over a sliding average over eight points. We estimated the white noise\namplitude, \u03c3w = 2.1 mmag, and the low-frequency red noise amplitude, \u03c3r = 0.2 mmag.\nThen, we assume that the 1-\u03c3 uncertainty intervals are determined by the surface defined\nby the equation (see Gillon et al. 2006, Eq. 7):\n\u03c72 = \u03c7bf + \u2206\u03c72 = \u03c7bf + 1 + Nt\n\n\u03c3r2\n,\n\u03c3w2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Nt is the number of points in the transit. Using the value for \u03c3r , \u03c3w , and Nt mentioned\nabove, we obtained \u2206\u03c72 = 1.25. The projections of this surface are shown in Figure 9. The\nparameters and uncertainty intervals obtained with this method are:\na/R\u2217 = 6.48 \u00b1 0.90\nRp /R\u2217 = 0.1455 \u00b1 0.0083\n\n(4)\n\ni = 86.66 \u00b1 3.34 ,\nwhere a is the orbit radius, Rp and R\u2217 are the planetary and stellar radius, respectively and\ni is the orbital inclination angle.\nWe also fitted the lightcurve to obtain a refined ephemeris for the transit times. The\nparameters obtained above were held fixed and the time at mean transit was fitted alone.\nUsing the ephemeris presented by Konacki et al. (2004) we also measure a refined period.\nOur refined ephemeris for the mean transit times of OGLE-TR113b is:\nHJD(middle of transit) = 2453471.77836(34) + 1.4324752(15) \u00d7 E ,\nwhere the numbers given in parentheses are the uncertainties in the last digits, about 30\nseconds for the central time and 0.2 seconds for the period. The obtained ephemeris agrees\nwith those from previous works (Konacki et al. 2004; Gillon et al. 2006; Snellen & Covino\n2006).\n\n4.\n\nThe Radius and other parameters of OGLE-TR-113-b\n\nThere are 20 giant planets with well measured radii to date (November 2006). These\nare the Solar system planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, plus the extrasolar planets OGLE-TR-10 (Konacki et al. 2005), OGLE-TR-56 (Konacki et al. 2003), OGLE-TR111 (Pont et al. 2004), OGLE-TR-113 (Bouchy et al. 2004; Konacki et al. 2004; Gillon et al.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n2006, and this work), OGLE-TR-132 (Bouchy et al. 2004), HD209458 (Charbonneau et al.\n2000b; Henry et al. 2000), HD189733 (Bouchy et al. 2005), HD149026 (Sato et al. 2005),\nTrES-1 (Alonso et al. 2004), TrES-2 (O'Donovan et al. 2006a), X0-1 (McCullough et al.\n2006), HAT-P-1 (Bakos et al. 2006), WASP-1 and WASP-2 (Collier Cameron et al. 2006).\nFinally, two more hot Jupiter planets out of 16 bonafide transiting candidates named SWEEPS4 and SWEEPS-11 have been discovered by Sahu et al. (2006) in the Galactic bulge.\nOur temporal resolution is not enough to obtain an accurate solution for all the parameters of the system. In particular, the sampling of the ingress and egress is not high enough\nto allow the breaking of the degeneracy between stellar radius and orbital inclination. Indeed, assuming a stellar mass of M\u2217 = (0.78 \u00b1 0.02) M\u2299 , the error on the primary radius\nobtained from our lightcurve using Kepler's third law is around 15% (R\u2217 = (0.76\u00b10.12) R\u2299 ).\nTherefore, to obtain the planetary parameters from the V-band fit parameters (see Equations 4) we relied on the accurate value for stellar radius given by Gillon et al. (2006):\nR\u2217 = (0.77 \u00b1 0.02) R\u2299 . The obtained parameters are shown in Table 1, together with those\nobtained in previous works. Note that due to our poorer temporal resolution the uncertainty\nintervals are larger than those presented in previous studies. Nevertheless, there exists an\nexcellent agreement with all previous works.\nIn order to measure the radius accurately, we rely on the optical photometry. Obviously,\nthe Ks -band photometry shows larger scatter, and even though we see the whole transit,\nthere is not enough baseline covered. Using the IR transit, it is possible to derive parameters\nfor the planetary companion to check for consistency only. We fit two lines, one for the outtransit data and another for the in-transit one, keeping zero the slope of the curve. The\ndifference between the intercepts of each straight line equals the depth of the transit. For\nOGLE-TR-113 we obtained \u2206KS = 0.035 \u00b1 0.009, from which we derive Rp = 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 RJ .\nClearly the error is large, but we find a value consistent with the more accurate V-band\nobservations. The transits in the I, V and Ks band are shown together for comparison in\nFigure 10.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe studied the OGLE-TR-113 star-planet system using optical and IR photometry.\nWe have produced an independent confirmation of the dwarf nature of OGLE-TR-113 by\nstudying the IR and optical CMDs in the observed fields.\nWe observed two transits of planet OGLE-TR-113-b. The first was observed in the Vband with VIMOS at the ESO VLT and the second in the Ks -band with SOFI at the ESO\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nNTT. There are 30 and 40 points per transit respectively. The quality of the photometry\nobtained with VIMOS is superb, with dispersion comparable to photon noise. Therefore,\nprocessing the complete VIMOS dataset should provide an interesting opportunity to identify\nnew transit candidates around 2 magnitudes fainter than those from the OGLE survey.\nWe compared our observations with those from previous works (Udalski et al. 2003;\nGillon et al. 2006), and confirmed that the transit amplitudes in the V, I, and R-bands are\nsimilar, consistent with the planetary nature of the transiting companion. The Ks -band\nphotometry also shows clearly the transit, although with a large scatter and insufficient\nbaseline. Within the larger errors, the parameters are consistent with the more accurate\nV-band observations.\nWe checked the limb darkening coefficients using the V-band photometry and found the\nvalues presented by Claret (2000) were adequate. However, we were not able to put strong\nconstraints to the coefficients in the Ks -band, since our light curve is not accurate enough.\nFinally, the planetary parameters obtained from the V-band photometry with assumed\nstellar radius R\u2217 = 0.77 R\u2299 are in excellent agreement with those presented in the cited\nworks (Konacki et al. 2004; Bouchy et al. 2004; Gillon et al. 2006). We measured the orbit\nradius a = (0.0232 \u00b1 0.0038) AU, the orbital period P = (1.4324752 \u00b1 0.0000015) days, the\ninclination angle i = (86.66 \u00b1 3.34) degrees and the planetary radius Rp = (1.09 \u00b1 0.09) RJ ,\nwhich for Mp = (1.32 \u00b1 0.19) MJ , gives the planet mean density \u03c1 = (1.26 \u00b1 0.50) g cm\u22123 .\nDM, JMF, GP, MZ, MTR, WG are supported by Fondap Center for Astrophysics No.\n15010003.
