Given a finitely generated module M over a local ring A of characteristic p with pd M < \u221e, we study the asymptotic intersection multiplicity\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x), where x = (x1 , . . . , xr ) is a system of parameters for M . We\nshow that there exists a system of parameters such that \u03c7\u221e is positive if and\nonly if dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r, where d = dim A and r = dim M . We use this\nto prove several results relating to the Grade Conjecture, which states that\ngrade M + dim M = dim A for any module M with pd M < \u221e.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn 1965, Serre [20] proved the following theorem about intersection multiplicities:\nTheorem 1.1 (Serre). Let A be a regular local ring either containing a field or\nunramified over a discrete valuation ring, and let M and N be finitely generated\nA-modules with l(M \u2297 N ) < \u221e. Then, writing\n\u03c7(M, N ) =\n\ndim\nXA\n\n(\u22121)i l(Tori (M, N )),\n\ni=0\n\nwe have\n(1) dim M + dim N \u2264 dim A\n(2) \u03c7(M, N ) \u2265 0\n(3) \u03c7(M, N ) = 0 if and only if dim M + dim N < dim A.\nHe also proved (1) for an arbitrary regular local ring, and conjectured that (2)\nand (3) hold as well. These statements can be further generalized to an arbitrary\nlocal ring when one of the modules has finite projective dimension, and they are\nknown as:\nThe Dimension Inequality. dim M + dim N \u2264 dim A;\nNon-negativity. \u03c7(M, N ) \u2265 0;\nVanishing. \u03c7(M, N ) = 0 if dim M + dim N < dim A; and\nPositivity. \u03c7(M, N ) > 0 if dim M + dim N = dim A.\nWhen A is regular local, nonnegativity was proved by Gabber [7], and vanishing\nwas proved by Roberts [16] and Gillet-Soul\u00e9 [8] independently; positivity is still open\nwhen A is a ramified regular local ring. When A is not regular, these conjectures\nare mostly open. Nonnegativity is false in general [5].\nPositivity is even unknown in the following special case: if pd M < \u221e and\nx1 , . . . , xr is a system of parameters for M , is \u03c7(M, A/x) > 0?\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\nIn 1982, Dutta [2] introduced an asymptotic multiplicity \u03c7\u221e , defined in Section 1.1, to investigate vanishing and positivity over a local ring of characteristic p.\nIn particular, he showed that \u03c7\u221e (M, N ) = 0 if dim M + dim N < dim A, and that\n\u03c7\u221e (M, N ) > 0 if dim M + dim N = dim A and M is Cohen-Macaulay.\nHowever, given a module M of finite projective dimension, and x1 , . . . , xr a\nsystem of parameters for M that is also an A-sequence, it is unknown whether\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0; in this case, we do know that \u03c7(M, A/x) > 0, due to Serre [20]\nand Lichtenbaum [12].\nWe will consider \u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) when x1 , . . . , xr is a system of parameters for M .\nWe prove the following:\nTheorem 2.6. Suppose pd M < \u221e, where d = dim A and r = dim M . Then there\nis a system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M , that is part of a system of parameters\nfor A, such that\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0 if and only if dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r.\nWe will also show a special case of asymptotic positivity:\nTheorem 2.8. Let d = dim A and r = dim M , and suppose that pd M = d \u2212 r.\nThen any system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M is part of a system of parameters\nfor A, and\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0.\nThe equivalence in Theorem 2.6 suggests that we investigate the condition\ndim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r,\nand in Section 3 this will lead us to study the following conjecture of Peskine and\nSzpiro [14, Conjecture (f) of Chapter II]:\nThe Grade Conjecture. Suppose that pd M < \u221e. Then\ngrade M + dim M = dim A.\nThe Grade Conjecture is known in some specific cases: when M is perfect or A is\nCohen-Macaulay\n(these are due to Peskine and Szpiro [14]); and\nL\nL in the graded case,\nwhen M =\nMi is a graded module over a graded ring A =\nAi with A0 artinian\n(this is also due to Peskine and Szpiro [15]). Foxby [6] showed that the Grade\nConjecture holds if A is complete and equidimensional in the equicharacteristic\ncase, and Roberts [18] showed this is true in arbitrary characteristic.\nIn Section 3, we will work toward a connection between the Grade Conjecture\nand \u03c7\u221e , and along the way we will prove Roberts' Theorem. We will then prove\nthe following:\nTheorem 3.8. Let A be a local ring in characteristic p, and suppose that pd M <\n\u221e. Assume the Grade Conjecture holds for M . Then there is a system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M , that is part of a system of parameters for A, such that\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0.\nThis connection gives us a few new cases in which dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r in\ncharacteristic p (recall d = dim A and r = dim M ): when pd M = d \u2212 r, and when\ndim M = 1 (Theorem 3.9 and Corollary 3.10).\nFinally, in Section 4, we use theorems of Hochster and Kurano to translate these\ncharacteristic p results to equicharacteristic zero.\n\n\fTHE GRADE CONJECTURE AND ASYMPTOTIC INTERSECTION MULTIPLICITY\n\n3\n\n1.1. Notation. Unless otherwise specified, all modules are finitely generated. All\nTor and Ext modules are computed over A unless otherwise specified.\nIf M is an A-module and x1 , . . . , xr elements of A, then write e(x; M ) for the\nmultiplicity of M with respect to x1 , . . . , xr . Depending on the context, we write\nx for either the sequence x1 , . . . , xr or the ideal generated by that sequence.\nWhen A is of prime characteristic p, we let f : A \u2192 A be the Frobenius map,\nn\nx 7\u2192 xp , and let f n be its nth iteration. We write f A for the bialgebra A with the\naction on the left by f n and the right by the identity. If M is an A-module, then\nn\nwe write F n (M ) = M \u2297 f A [14].\nWhen the limits exist, we define [2]\n\u03c7(F n (M ), N )\nn\u2192\u221e\npn codim M\n\n\u03c7\u221e (M, N ) = lim\nand\n\ne(x; F n (M ))\n,\nn\u2192\u221e pn codim M\n\ne\u221e (x; M ) = lim\nwhere codim M = dim A \u2212 dim M .\nIf M is an A-module, then\n\ngrade M = depth ann M\nis the length of the longest A-sequence contained in ann M . We say M is perfect if\npd M = grade M .\n2. Ext and Asymptotic Limits\nThroughout this section, we suppose A is complete and has characteristic p, and\nlet d = dim A.\nWe first need some facts about asymptotic limits [19, Proposition 1].\nLemma 2.1 (Seibert). Let L\u2022 be a complex of finitely generated free modules with\nhomologies of finite length. For each i \u2265 0, the limit\nl(Hi (F n (L\u2022 )))\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\npnd\nexists, and if H0 (L\u2022 ) 6= 0, then\nl(H0 (F n (L\u2022 )))\n\u2265 1.\nn\u2192\u221e\npnd\nlim\n\nWe now prove an equivalence we will use several times.\nProposition 2.2. Suppose pd M < \u221e, and set r = dim M . Then\ndim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r\n\nif and only if there is a prime p \u2208 Ass M with dim A/p = r and ht p = d \u2212 r.\n\nProof. If dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r, then there is some prime\n\np \u2208 Supp Extd\u2212r (M, A) \u2286 Supp M\n\nwith dim A/p = r. Such a prime is necessarily minimal over ann M , so it is in\nAss M . Furthermore, pd Mp \u2265 d \u2212 r (since Extd\u2212r\nAp (Mp , Ap ) 6= 0), so\nht p = dim Ap \u2265 depth Ap \u2265 pd Mp \u2265 d \u2212 r\n\nby Auslander-Buchsbaum. Since ht p certainly cannot be larger, ht p = d \u2212 r.\n\n\f4\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\nConversely, suppose that p \u2208 Ass M with dim A/p = r and ht p = d \u2212 r. Then\nMp is of finite length and finite projective dimension, so by Lemma 3.4, Mp is\nperfect of projective dimension d \u2212 r over Ap , and hence\nExtd\u2212r (M, A)p 6= 0,\n\nso dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r (the dimension clearly cannot be larger than r).\nd\u2212r\n\nUsing Proposition 2.2, we can relate e\u221e to the dimension of Ext\n\n\u0003\n\n(M, A).\n\nTheorem 2.3. Suppose pd M < \u221e, and set r = dim M . Then\ndim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r\n\nif and only if e\u221e (x; M ) > 0 for some (= every) system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr\nfor M that is part of a system of parameters for A.\nProof. We have [13, Theorem 14.7]\ne(x; F n (M )) =\n\nX\n\ne(x; A/p)l(F n (M )p ),\n\np\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all primes p \u2208 Supp M with dim A/p = r. Now, due\nto the associativity of the tensor product, it follows [14] that\nl(FAn (M )p ) = l(FAnp (Mp )).\nBy Proposition 2.2, dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r if and only if there is a prime p \u2208 Supp M\nwith dim A/p = r and ht p = d \u2212 r; which, using Lemma 2.1 on each l(FAnp (Mp ))\n\u0003\nin the above formula, happens if and only if e\u221e (x; M ) > 0.\nRemark 2.4. If the Dimension Inequality is true, then it implies that any system of\nparameters for M is part of a system of parameters for A, so the last assumption\nin the above theorem would be superfluous.\nWe will now relate e\u221e to \u03c7\u221e for a suitably chosen system of parameters:\nProposition 2.5. Suppose pd M < \u221e and dim M < dim A. Then there is a\nsystem of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M , that is part of a system of parameters for\nA, such that\ne(x; M ) = \u03c7(M, A/x).\nProof. We first claim that we can choose a system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M\nthat is part of a system of parameters for A, such that the higher Koszul homologies\nhave finite length, i.e.,\nl(Hi (x; A)) < \u221e for all i \u2265 1.\n\nTo do so, choose xi+1 \u2208 m\n(1) a parameter on M/(x1 , . . . , xi )M\n(2) a parameter on A/(x1 , . . . , xi )A\n(3) not in any prime p 6= m in Ass(A/(x1 , . . . , xi )A)\nThen, if we localize the Koszul complex K\u2022 (x; A) at any nonmaximal prime, all the\nxi will be either units or nonzerodivisors mod x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 , so the higher homologies\nwill vanish, and hence they all have finite length.\nNow, let D\u2022\u2022 be the double complex from tensoring K\u2022 (x; A) with a free resolution L\u2022 for M . There are two associated spectral sequences, both converging to\nH \u2217 (Tot(D\u2022\u2022 )):\n\n\fTHE GRADE CONJECTURE AND ASYMPTOTIC INTERSECTION MULTIPLICITY\n\n5\n\n(1) I E2s,t = Ht (x; M ) when s = 0, and zero otherwise\n(2) II E2s,t = Tors (M, Ht (x; A))\nSince all the above E2 terms have finite length, and there are only finitely many of\nthem (they vanish for s > pd M and t > r), the Euler characteristics of the two E2\nterms are equal, so we have\nX\nX\n(\u22121)s+t l(Tors (M, Ht (x; A))).\n(\u22121)t l(Ht (x; M )) =\ns,t\n\nt\n\nThe left-hand side is just e(x; M ) (see, e.g., [20, Theorem 1 of Chapter IV]), and\nthe right side is just\nX\n(\u22121)t \u03c7(M, Ht (x; A)).\nt\n\nFor t \u2265 1, the Ht (x; A) have finite length, by the choice of x above; since dim M <\ndim A, we have \u03c7(M, Ht (x; A)) = 0 for t \u2265 1. Thus\ne(x; M ) = \u03c7(M, H0 (x; A)) = \u03c7(M, A/x),\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nNote that the choice of x1 , . . . , xr depends only on Supp M , so the same system\nof parameters can be used for F n (M ) for all n. We can therefore use Proposition\n2.5 to translate Theorem 2.3 to \u03c7\u221e :\nTheorem 2.6. Suppose pd M < \u221e, and set d = dim A and r = dim M . Then there\nis a system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M , that is part of a system of parameters\nfor A, such that\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0 if and only if dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r.\nFor the proof of the next theorem, we need the following two results. First, the\nfollowing theorem of Dutta's [4]:\nTheorem 2.7 (Dutta). Let F\u2022 be a complex of finitely-generated free modules with\nhomologies of finite length. Let N be a finitely generated module. Let Wjn denote\nthe jth homology of Hom(F n (F\u2022 ), N ), and write\nd\n\u00d1 = Hom(Hm\n(N ), E),\n\nwhere E = E(k) is the injective hull of k.\nWe have the following:\n(1) If dim N < dim A, then lim l(Wjn )/pnd = 0.\n(2) If dim N = dim A, and\n(a) j < d, then lim l(Wjn )/pnd = 0;\n(b) j = d, then lim l(Wjn )/pnd = lim l(F n (H0 (F\u2022 )) \u2297 \u00d1 )/pnd , which is\npositive;\n(c) j > d, then lim l(Wjn )/pnd = lim l(Hj\u2212d (F n (F\u2022 )) \u2297 \u00d1 )/pnd .\nWe will also use Peskine and Szpiro's Intersection Theorem:\nThe Intersection Theorem. Suppose that pd M < \u221e, and let N be another\nfinitely generated A-module such that l(M \u2297 N ) < \u221e. Then\ndim N \u2264 pd M.\n\n\f6\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\nPeskine and Szpiro [14] first proved this when A has characteristic p, and in\nmany equicharacteristic cases; Hochster [9] proved the equicharacteristic case; and\nRoberts [17] proved the mixed characteristic case.\nWe will now show a special case of asymptotic positivity:\nTheorem 2.8. Let d = dim A and r = dim M , and suppose that pd M = d \u2212 r.\nThen any system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M is part of a system of parameters\nfor A, and\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0.\nProof. We write B = A/x. By the Intersection Theorem,\ndim B \u2264 pd M = d \u2212 r,\nand so we can choose y1 , . . . , yd\u2212r such that l(B/yB) < \u221e. Since d = dim A, it\nfollows that x1 , . . . , xr , y1 , . . . , yd\u2212r is a system of parameters for A, proving the\nfirst claim.\nNow we let L\u2022 be a free resolution for M over A, and let F\u2022 = Hom(L\u2022 , B). We\nwill apply Theorem 2.7 to F\u2022 over the ring B, with N = B. We note that\nWjn = Tord\u2212r\u2212j (F n (M ), B),\nsince the length of the complex L\u2022 is pd M = d \u2212 r (we are flipping the indices for\nF\u2022 ; that is, Fi = Hom(Ld\u2212r\u2212i , B)). By Theorem 2.7,\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all j < d \u2212 r, which means that\n\nl(Wjn )\n= 0,\npn(d\u2212r)\n\nl(F n (M ) \u2297 B)\n>0\nn\u2192\u221e\npn(d\u2212r)\n\n\u03c7\u221e (M, B) = lim\nby Lemma 2.1, proving the theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. The Grade Conjecture\nIn this section, A is an arbitrary local ring, unless otherwise specified.\nWe begin with a result of Peskine and Szpiro's [14, Lemma 4.8]:\nLemma 3.1 (Peskine-Szpiro). Let M be a finite A-module. Then\ndepth A \u2264 grade M + dim M \u2264 dim A.\nThis immediately implies the grade conjecture when A is Cohen-Macaulay:\nCorollary 3.2. Suppose A is Cohen-Macaulay. Then\ngrade M + dim M = dim A\nfor all finitely generated modules M .\nWhen M is perfect, the grade conjecture follows immediately from the Intersection Theorem:\nCorollary 3.3 (Peskine-Szpiro). Suppose pd M < \u221e and M is perfect. Then\ngrade M + dim M = dim A.\n\n\fTHE GRADE CONJECTURE AND ASYMPTOTIC INTERSECTION MULTIPLICITY\n\n7\n\nProof. Let x1 , . . . , xr be a system of parameters for M . By the Intersection Theorem (and since M is perfect),\ndim A/x \u2264 pd M = grade M.\n\nUsing dim A/x \u2265 dim A \u2212 dim M gives dim A \u2264 grade M + dim M ; and the reverse\ninequality follows from Lemma 3.1.\n\u0003\nNext, we have some basic results about the annihilator of modules with finite\nprojective dimension.\nLemma 3.4. Suppose pd M < \u221e and dim M = 0. Then M is perfect and A is\nCohen-Macaulay.\nProof. Since dim M = 0, ann M is m-primary, so grade M = depth A. By AuslanderBuchsbaum,\npd M + depth M = depth A,\nand so depth M = 0 implies pd M = grade M , i.e., M is perfect; and by Corollary\n3.3, A is Cohen-Macaulay.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.5. Suppose pd M < \u221e. Then ht ann M = grade M .\nProof. Let x1 , . . . , xg be a maximal A-sequence contained in I = ann M (so g =\ngrade M ). Then\nHom(M, A/x) = Extg (M, A) 6= 0.\nChoose a minimal prime p in Supp M \u2229 Ass A/x. Then\nHom(Mp , Ap /xAp ) 6= 0,\n\nso grade Mp = grade M = g and ht p \u2265 ht I.\nSince p \u2208 Ass A/x, depth Ap = g; by Auslander-Buchsbaum,\ndepth Mp + pd Mp = g;\n\nand hence pd Mp = g = grade Mp , i.e., Mp is perfect over Ap . Corollary 3.3 then\nimplies that\ngrade Mp + dim Mp = dim Ap .\nNow we choose a prime q with I \u2286 q \u2286 p, minimal over I, with dim Ap /qAp =\ndim Mp . We also note that dim Aq \u2265 depth Aq \u2265 g.\nWe now have\ndim Ap\n\n\u2265 dim Ap /qAp + dim Aq\n= dim Mp + dim Aq\n\u2265 dim Mp + g\n= dim Ap ,\n\nwhich implies that the above inequalities are equalities; in particular, dim Aq = g,\nwhich means that ht I \u2264 ht q = g = grade M . Since the reverse inequality is always\ntrue, we have equality.\n\u0003\nFrom this, we get a special case of the grade conjecture [18]:\nTheorem 3.6 (Roberts). Suppose that A is complete and equidimensional and\npd M < \u221e. Then\ngrade M + dim M = dim A.\n\n\f8\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\nProof. We will show that grade M + dim M \u2265 dim A; equality then holds because\nthe reverse inequality is just Lemma 3.1.\nWe choose a prime p \u2208 Supp M with ht p = ht ann M , and then choose a minimal\nprime q \u2286 p with ht p/q = ht p. We then have\ndim A =\n\ndim A/q\n\n=\n=\n\ndim A/p + ht p/q\ndim A/p + ht p\n\n=\n\u2264\n\ndim A/p + grade M\ndim M + grade M\n\nwhere the first equality follows because A is equidimensional; the second because\nA is complete, and hence catenary; and the fourth from Lemma 3.5. Finally, the\ninequality holds since dim A/p \u2264 dim M always.\n\u0003\nWe will now prove a connection between the Grade Conjecture and \u03c7\u221e .\nCorollary 3.7. Suppose pd M < \u221e and that grade M + dim M = dim A (i.e., the\ngrade conjecture holds for M ). Let d = dim A and r = dim M . Then\ndim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r.\nProof. Let p \u2208 Supp M with dim A/p = r. Then l(Mp ) < \u221e, so by Lemma 3.4,\nMp is perfect over the Cohen-Macaulay ring Ap . We then have\nd \u2212 r = grade M \u2264 grade Mp = dim Ap = ht p,\nso we are done by Proposition 2.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Theorem 2.6, this implies:\nTheorem 3.8. Let A be a local ring in characteristic p, and suppose that pd M <\n\u221e. Assume the Grade Conjecture holds for M . Then there is a system of parameters x1 , . . . , xr for M , that is part of a system of parameters for A, such that\n\u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0.\nWe also can use \u03c7\u221e to show special cases for which dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r.\nTheorem 3.9. Let A be a local ring in characteristic p, and let d = dim A and\nr = dim M . Suppose that pd M = d \u2212 r. Then dim Extd\u2212r (M, A) = r.\nProof. Choose x1 , . . . , xr as in Proposition 2.5. We then have\ne\u221e (x; M ) = \u03c7\u221e (M, A/x) > 0,\nby Theorem 2.8, so the theorem follows from Theorem 2.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.10. Let A be a local ring in characteristic p of dimension d, and\nsuppose pd M < \u221e and dim M = 1. Then dim Extd\u22121 (M, A) = 1.\nProof. By the Intersection Theorem, either pd M = d \u2212 1 or pd M = d.\nIn the former case, the result follows from Theorem 3.9. In the latter case, A\nis Cohen-Macaulay, so the grade conjecture holds (Corollary 3.2) and the result\nfollows from Corollary 3.7.\n\u0003\n\n\fTHE GRADE CONJECTURE AND ASYMPTOTIC INTERSECTION MULTIPLICITY\n\n9\n\n4. The Equicharacteristic Zero Case\nOne can show Theorem 3.9 and Corollary 3.10 in equicharacteristic zero by\nusing standard techniques to reduce to characteristic p. We will sketch the proof\nfor Theorem 3.9, and the same techniques can be used for Corollary 3.10, as well\nas the Grade Conjecture itself.\nIn this section, if f1 , . . . , fN \u2208 Z[X1 , . . . , Xm ], and x1 , . . . , xm are elements of\nsome ring R, then we say that x is a solution of f1 , . . . , fN if\nf1 (x) = 0, . . . , fN (x) = 0.\nThe basis for the reduction is Hochster's \"metatheorem\":\nTheorem 4.1 (Hochster). Let\nf1 , . . . , fN \u2208 Z[X1 , . . . , Xd , U1 , . . . , Ut ],\nwhere Xi and Ui are indeterminates. If f1 , . . . , fN have a solution (x, u) in a local\nring A of equicharacteristic zero, with x1 , . . . , xd forming a system of parameters\nfor A, then f1 , . . . , fN have a solution (x\u2032 , u\u2032 ) in a local ring A\u2032 of characteristic p,\nwith x\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032d forming a system of parameters for A\u2032 .\nWe will use a more generalized version [11]:\nTheorem 4.2 (Kurano). Let\nf1 , . . . , fN \u2208 Z[Y1 , . . . , Yn , X1 , . . . , Xd , G1 , . . . , Gl , U1 , . . . , Ut ],\nwhere Xi , Yi , Gi , and Ui are indeterminates. If f1 , . . . , fN have a solution (y, x, g, u)\nin a regular local ring R of equicharacteristic zero, with y1 , . . . , yn forming a regular system of parameters for R, and x1 , . . . , xd forming a system of parameters\nfor R/g, then f1 , . . . , fN have a solution (y \u2032 , x\u2032 , g\u2032 , u\u2032 ) in a regular local ring R\u2032 of\ncharacteristic p, with y1\u2032 , . . . , yn\u2032 forming a regular system of parameters for R\u2032 , and\nx\u20321 , . . . , x\u2032d forming a system of parameters for R\u2032 /g\u2032 .\nThe goal, then, is to find equations that preserve the particular properties that\nwe're interested in. The main result we need is that we can preserve the dimension\nof homology modules in the following sense.\nLemma 4.3. Let R be a regular local ring, and let A = R/(g1 , . . . , gl ) be a quotient.\nSuppose that\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\n\nAa \u2212\u2192 Ab \u2212\u2192 Ac\n\nis a complex of free A-modules with homology of dimension h (where we set h = \u2212\u221e\nif the complex is exact). We choose matrices (r ij ) and (sij ) that represent the maps\n\u03c6 and \u03c8, with rij , sij \u2208 R. Then there are polynomials f1 , . . . , fN with coefficients\nin Z in indeterminates\n(1) Y1 , . . . , Yn\n(2) G1 , . . . , Gl\n(3) Uij and Vij , corresponding to the matrices rij and sij\n(4) W1 , . . . , Wt (for some sufficiently large t)\nsuch that\n(1) There are y and w in R such that (y, g, (rij ), (sij ), w) is a solution of\nf1 , . . . , fN , and y1 , . . . , yn forms a regular system of parameters for R.\n\n\f10\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\u2032\n), (s\u2032ij ), w \u2032 ) is a solution of f1 , . . . , fN in a regular local ring R\u2032\n(2) If (y \u2032 , g\u2032 , (rij\n\u2032\nwith y1 , . . . , yn\u2032 forming a regular system of parameters for R\u2032 , then, setting\nA\u2032 = R\u2032 /g\u2032 , and letting \u03c6\u2032 and \u03c8 \u2032 be maps corresponding to the matrices\n(r \u2032ij ) and (s\u2032ij ,\n\u03c6\u2032\n\n\u03c8\u2032\n\nA\u2032a \u2212\u2192 A\u2032b \u2212\u2192 A\u2032c\n\nis a complex of free A\u2032 modules with homology of dimension h.\nThe proof is very similar to the proof of [11, Lemma 3.11]. We will give an\noutline.\nProof. (Sketch) Let K\u03c6 , I\u03c6 , C\u03c6 ; K\u03c8 , I\u03c8 , C\u03c8 be the kernel, image, and cokernel of \u03c6\nand \u03c8, respectively. Let K\u03c6\u2022 , I\u03c6\u2022 , C\u03c6\u2022 , K\u03c8\u2022 , I\u03c8\u2022 , C\u03c8\u2022 be minimal free resolutions\nfor each over R. This gives us exact sequences of acyclic complexes of free Rmodules\n0 \u2192 K\u03c6\u2022 \u2192 F\u2022 \u2192 I\u03c6\u2022 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 I\u03c6\u2022 \u2192 F\u2032\u2022 \u2192 C\u03c6\u2022 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 K\u03c8\u2022 \u2192 F\u2032\u2032\u2022 \u2192 I\u03c8\u2022 \u2192 0\n0 \u2192 I\u03c8\u2022 \u2192 F\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u2192 C\u03c8\u2022 \u2192 0\n\u2022\nc\nwhere F\u2022 is a finite free resolution of Aa , F\u2032\u2022 and F\u2032\u2032\u2022 are of Ab , and F\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u2022 is of A .\nWe can similarly write down exact sequences of complexes relating the finite free\nresolutions F\u2022 , etc., with a minimal free resolution of A (summed a, b, or c times,\nas appropriate).\nNext, we consider the exact sequence\n\n0 \u2192 I\u03c6 \u2192 K\u03c8 \u2192 H \u2192 0\nwhere H is the homology of the original sequence. We extend the map I\u03c6 \u2192 K\u03c8 to\na map on the complexes I\u03c6\u2022 \u2192 K\u03c8\u2022 . This allows us to construct a free resolution\nfor H that ends with\n(1)\n\n(I\u03c6 )0 \u2295 (K\u03c8 )1 \u2192 (K\u03c8 )0 \u2192 H \u2192 0.\n\nNow, we would like to find equations to preserve the exactness of all the complexes above, and also the dimension of the cokernel H of the map in (1).\nTo preserve the exactness of a finite complex of free R-modules, e.g.,\nd\n\ndh\u22121\n\nd\n\nd\n\n1\n2\nh\nF0 ,\nF1 \u2212\u2192\nF\u2022 : 0 \u2192 Fh \u2212\u2192\nFh\u22121 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192\n\nwe first choose matrices (ckij ) to represent the maps dk , and choose corresponding\nk\nvariables Cij\n. From each pairwise composition dk+1 dk = 0, we get a system of\nk\nequations on the Cij\ns that preserves the fact that F\u2022 is a complex.\nTo preserve the fact that F\u2022 is acyclic, we use the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud criteria\nfor exactness [1]:\nPh\na) To ensure the rank of each dk is at least rk = i=k (\u22121)i rank Fi , we add\nk\nequations so rk + 1 minors of the matrices Cij\nvanish.\nb) To ensure that the grade (= height, since R is regular local) of the determinental ideal Irk (dk ) is at least k, we first add n \u2212 ht I elements of R to I\nto reduce\n\u221a to the case where I is m-primary, and then write equations such\nthat I = m = (y1 , . . . , yn ).\n\n\fTHE GRADE CONJECTURE AND ASYMPTOTIC INTERSECTION MULTIPLICITY\n\n11\n\nFinally, preserving the dimension of the cokernel of a map of free R-modules is\nsimilar (this is preserving the height of an ideal, which is a bit more work than\nabove, where we prevent the height from decreasing), which allows us to preserve\nthe dimension of the homology H.\n\u0003\nThis allows us to preserve many properties of modules. In particular:\nLemma 4.4. Let R be a regular local ring, let A = R/(g1 , . . . , gl ) be a quotient,\nand let M be an A-module of finite projective dimension.

This preserves the projective resolution of M , as well as dim M .\nNow, taking Hom(\u2212, A) of the free resolution for M , for each pair of maps\n\u03c6k\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6k+1\n\n\u2217\n\nAbk\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Abk \u2212\u2192 Abk+1 ,\n\nwe choose equations as in Lemma 4.3, using the same variables for the dual of\na map as we used for the map itself. This preserves dim ExtkA (M, A) (including\nwhether ExtkA (M, A) = 0), and so it also preserves grade M . Combining these sets\nof equations, we can preserve all the numerical data, as desired.\n\u0003\nPutting this together with Theorem 4.2, we can now extend Theorem 3.9 to\nequicharacteristic:\n\n\f12\n\nJESSE BEDER\n\nTheorem 4.5.

Without loss of generality, we can\nassume that A is complete, so A is the quotient of a regular local ring. By Lemma\n4.4, we can find equations that preserve the pd M , dim M , and dim Extd\u2212r (M, A).\nBy Theorem 4.2, there is a local ring of characteristic p that satisfies those equations, which produces a counterexample in characteristic p as well, contradicting\nTheorem 3.9.\n\u0003\nSimilar arguments can be used to extend Corollary 3.10 to equicharacteristic, and\nto reduce the Grade Conjecture from equicharacteristic zero to characteristic p:\nCorollary 4.6.
