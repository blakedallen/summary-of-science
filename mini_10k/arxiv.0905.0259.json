The AMANDA experiment [4] at the south pole, which came to the\nend of its mission in 2006, has set the following bound on the diffuse flux of neutrinos\nE\u03bd2\n\ndF\u03bd\n\u2264 8.2\ndE\u03bd\n\nGeV cm\u22122 sr\u22121 yr\u22121 .\n\n(1)\n\nA km3 -scale neutrino telescope named ICECUBE is under construction which encompasses\nAMANDA. If the bound in (1) is saturated, the completed ICECUBE can collect \u223c 4000\ncosmic neutrino signal each year [5]. Notice that this bound is on the sum of the neutrino\nfluxes from sources at cosmological distances. In principle, core collapse supernova explosions\nleading to an intense neutrino flux detectable at km3 -scale neutrino telescopes can also take\nplace in the close-by galaxies located at a distance of . 10 Mpc [6, 7]. If such an explosion is\nregistered during the time that the ICECUBE is in full swing, ICECUBE can record about\na few hundred neutrino events from a single explosion [7]. In addition to ICECUBE in the\nsouth pole, three neutrino telescopes NEMO [8], ANTARES [9] and NESTOR [10] are being\nconstructed in the Mediterranean sea. Moreover, the so-called KM3NET neutrino telescope\n[11] is planned to be constructed in the Mediterranean sea.\nIn view of this prospect, extensive studies have been performed on the possibility of\nderiving information on the mixing parameters of neutrinos by studying the flavor ratio of\nthe neutrinos at the detector [12, 13, 14]. The method is based on the following argument.\nSuppose the flavor ratio at the source was F\u03bde + F\u03bd\u0304e : F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc : F\u03bd\u03c4 + F\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 = we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 .\nAfter propagating the distance between the source and the detector, the flavor ratio will\nbecome\nF\u03bde + F\u03bd\u0304e : F\u03bd\u03bc + F\u03bd\u0304\u03bc : F\u03bd\u03c4 + F\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 =\n\nX\n\nw\u03b10 P\u03b1e :\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nw\u03b10 P\u03b1\u03bc :\n\nX\n\nw\u03b10 P\u03b1\u03c4 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere P\u03b1\u03b2 is the probability of \u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 . Considering the very long distance between the\nsource and the Earth (i.e., \u2206m2ij L/(2E\u03bd ) \u226b 1), the oscillatory terms in P\u03b1\u03b2 average out 3 :\nX\nP\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 P (\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = P (\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03b2 ) =\n|U\u03b1i |2 |U\u03b2i |2 ,\n(3)\ni\n\n3\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the loss of coherence, see [19].\n\n2\n\n\fwhere U\u03b1i are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix. Notice that P\u03b1\u03b2 is independent\nof the neutrino energy E\u03bd , distance L and the mass square differences \u2206m2ij .\nIn a wide range of models that lead to detectable cosmic neutrino flux, the neutrino\n(\u2212)\n\nproduction takes place through \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc and subsequently \u03bc \u2192 e\u03bde \u03bd\u03bc . The flavor\nratios at the source are therefore predicted to be we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0. Thus, by\nmeasuring the flavor ratio at Earth, one can in principle derive the absolute values of the\nmixing matrix elements which yield information on the yet-unknown neutrino parameters\n\u03b813 and \u03b4 as well as the deviation of \u03b823 from \u03c0/4 [12, 13, 14, 15]. It is also suggested to\nemploy cosmic neutrinos to discriminate between the standard oscillation scenario and more\nexotic possibilities [17, 18].\nThe flavor identification power of ICECUBE and other neutrino telescopes is limited.\nIn fact, in the energy range of interest (100 GeV < E\u03bd < 100 TeV), ICECUBE can only\ndistinguish between shower-like events and the \u03bc-track events. Each of these two types of\nevents can receive contributions from different flavors. As discussed in the next section,\nseveral input and assumptions go into derivation of the flavor composition from the ratio of\nthe shower-like events to the \u03bc-track events. Lack of knowledge or uncertainty on these input\nparameters will lead to uncertainty in derivation of \u03b813 and \u03b4 from the cosmic neutrinos. To\nderive information on the unknown mixing parameters (\u03b813 and/or \u03b4) from the ratio, one\nshould also consider the effect of the uncertainty on the known neutrino mixing parameters,\n\u03b823 and \u03b812 . A complete treatment of all these effects is missing in the literature. In the first\npart of this paper, we study the possibility of deriving \u03b813 and \u03b4 from the ratio of shower-like\nevents to \u03bc-track events. We take into account the uncertainty of the aforementioned inputs\nas well as the possible uncertainty in the measurement of the ratio itself. In our analysis, we\ninclude contributions to the shower-like and \u03bc-track events whose effects can be larger than\nthe effect of \u03b4 and \u03b813 but their effects have been overlooked in the literature. We discuss\nhow much the precision of various input parameters has to be improved in order to make\nthe measurement of \u03b813 or \u03b4 by neutrino telescopes a reality.\nVarious effects can cause a substantial deviation of the flavor ratio from we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 =\n1 : 2 : 0. In the second part of the paper, considering the realistic uncertainties in the input,\nwe discuss to what extent the ratio at the source can be determined under the assumption\nthat propagation of neutrinos from the source to detector is simply governed by the standard\noscillation formula in Eqs. (2,3).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the mechanism for flavor identification\n3\n\n\fat neutrino telescopes is described. In Sect. 3, the features of the cosmic neutrino fluxes\npredicted by the mainstream models are discussed. In Sect. 4, assuming CP conservation,\nthe effects of possible sources of uncertainties on the derivation of s13 are studied. An analysis\nof derivation of \u03b4 in the presence of uncertainties is performed in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 is devoted\nto discussing various possible mechanisms through which the initial ratios can deviate from\n1 : 2 : 0. We discuss whether by measuring the flavor ratio on Earth, it will be possible to\ndifferentiate between models. A summary of the conclusions is provided in Sect. 7.\n\n2\n\nFlavor identification\n\nICECUBE and its Mediterranean counterparts can basically distinguish only two types of\nevents: 1) shower-like events; 2) \u03bc-track events. As shown in the seminal work by Beacom\net al. [20], one can derive information on the flavor composition by studying the ratio of the\n\u03bc-track events to shower-like events. Let us define\nR=\n\nNumber of Muon-track events\n.\nNumber of Shower-like events\n\n(4)\n\nThere is a threshold energy, Eth below which the neutrino cannot be detected by a neutrino\ntelescope. The value of Eth depends on the structure of the detector and the type of the\nevent (shower-like versus \u03bc-track). Since the detection of neutrinos coming from above suffers\nfrom the large background from cosmic rays, the neutrino telescopes mainly focus on upward\ngoing neutrinos; i.e., neutrinos that pass through the Earth before reaching the detector (see\nhowever, [21]). The Earth is opaque for neutrinos with energies higher than \u223c 100 TeV [22].\nIn sum, the neutrino telescopes mainly study the muon neutrinos in the range Eth \u223c 100 GeV\nand E\u03bdcut \u223c 100 TeV. In calculating the fluxes we set the upper limit of the integration equal\nto E\u03bdcut = 100 TeV. By using this value for the upper limit, we can neglect the attenuation\nof the neutrino flux crossing the Earth which depends on the direction of the neutrino [23].\nTwo sources contribute to the \u03bc-track events: (i) Charged Current (CC) interaction of \u03bd\u03bc\nor \u03bd\u0304\u03bc producing \u03bc or \u03bc\u0304; (ii) CC interaction of \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 producing \u03c4 or \u03c4\u0304 and the subsequent\ndecay of \u03c4 and \u03c4\u0304 into \u03bc and \u03bc\u0304. In the literature, the contribution of \u03bd\u03c4 (via \u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc)\nto \u03bc-track events has been overlooked but to study the effect of \u03b813 , one should take into\naccount such sub-dominant effects.\n\n4\n\n\fThe contribution of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc to the \u03bc-track events can be estimated as\nZZ\nCC\n\u03bc dF\u03bd\u03bc d\u03c3\ndE\u03bc dE\u03bd\u03bc + [particle \u2192 antiparticle],\n\u03c1ANA\nR\u03bc (E\u03bc , Eth\n)\ndE\u03bd\u03bc dE\u03bc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c1, A and NA are respectively the density of the medium (ice/water), the effective\narea of the detector and the Avogadro number. R\u03bc (E1 , E2 ) is the muon range which is the\ndistance traveled in the medium by a muon with energy E1 before its energy drops below\nE2 . The muon range in ice is given by [24]\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2 + 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123E1\n,\n(6)\nR\u03bc (E1 , E2 ) = (2.6 Km) ln\n2 + 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123E2\nwhere both E1 and E2 are in GeV. Finally, dF\u03bd\u03bc /dE\u03bd\u03bc and \u03c3 CC are respectively the neutrino\nflux spectral function at the detector and the cross section of the CC interactions of \u03bd\u03bc .\nThe contributions from \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 to \u03bc-track events can be estimated as\nZ Ecut Z Z\ndF\u03bd\u03c4 d\u03c3 CC\n\u03bc\nB\u03c1ANA\nf (E\u03c4 , E\u03bc ) R\u03bc (E\u03bc , Eth\n)dE\u03bc dE\u03c4 dE\u03bd\u03c4 + (\u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) ,\n\u03bc dE\ndE\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\u03c4\nEth\n\n(7)\n\nwhere B \u2261 Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03bd\u03c4 ) = 17.8%. The function f (E\u03c4 , E\u03bc ) in the above equation is the\nprobability density of the production of a muon with energy E\u03bc in the decay of a \u03c4 lepton\nwith energy E\u03c4 .

(5,7)]. This is because muons can emit\nCherenkov light and trigger the detector even if they are produced outside the detector but\nwithin the range R\u03bc . In other words, for the muon detection, the effective volume is larger\nthan the geometrical volume.\nTo write down the above formulas, several simplifications have been made:\n\u2022 Obviously, neutrinos entering the detector through different zenith angles have propagated different lengths inside the earth so the amount of attenuation is different for\nthem. In other words, to be precise, the zenith angle dependence of E\u03bdcut has to be\ntaken into account.\n\u2022 The energy threshold for detecting the neutrino also depends on the direction. For the\n\u03bc\nvertically propagating muon at ICECUBE, Eth\nis about 20 GeV; that is while, for the\n\u03bc\nmuons propagating horizontally, Eth is about 100 GeV [25].\n\n\u2022 For the high energy muons with E\u03bc > 1 TeV, the muon ranges both in the ice and rock\nexceed 1 km, (see Eq. (6) and Ref. [24]). The depth of the ice at the site of ICECUBE\nis about 2810 m; so a considerable number of muons reaching the ICECUBE would be\nproduced in the rock beneath the ice where the density is quite different.\n\u2022 As mentioned before, for neutrinos with energies higher than 100 TeV the Earth is\nopaque. For very high energies, \u03bd\u03c4 can however be regenerated through \u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2192\n\u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 ... \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 . As a result, \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 with E\u03bd \u226b 100 TeV can give a contribution to\nthe upward-going neutrino flux with E < 100 TeV. The neutrino flux at high energies\nis expected to be suppressed. Thus, such a contribution is expected to be negligible\n[26]. This assumption can in principle be tested by measuring the downward-going\nshower-like events (which have not traversed the Earth).\nThroughout the present analysis, we use the approximate formulae (5,7,9,10,11). We determine how much the uncertainties in various inputs have to be improved in order not to be an\n6\n\n\fobstacle for determination of \u03b4 and s13 . As we shall see, our conclusion is that even without\nthe above subtleties, the required precision in certain input parameters is so fine that seems\nbeyond reach in the foreseeable future. Taking into account the above uncertainties not only\nwill not change our conclusion but will further confirm it.\n\n3\n\nThe standard picture\n\nTo evaluate R, several input parameters have to be known: i) the energy spectrum of the\nincoming neutrinos; ii) the ratio of the neutrino flux to the anti-neutrino flux; iii) the initial\nratio we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 . We rely on the predictions of the models for such input parameters.\nAlthough the models differ in details, they share some common features. From now on,\nwe call these features the \"standard picture.\" The features of the standard picture are\nenumerated below.\n\u2022 In the standard picture neutrinos are produced in the following chain of processes.\nFirst, the energetic protons in jets collide on \u03b3 or on the background protons and\nproduce \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 . Then,\n\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc\n\u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03bde\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n.\n\u03bc\u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u0304e\n\n(12)\n\nThus, we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0.\n\u2022 The energy spectra of the neutrinos follow power law distributions:\ndF\u03bd\u03b2\n= N\u03b2 E\u03bd\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b2\ndE\u03bd\u03b2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N\u03b2 is the normalization factor for each neutrino and anti-neutrino flavor. \u03b1 is\nthe spectral index. In the standard picture where the initial protons are accelerated to\nhigh energies via Fermi acceleration mechanism, the spectral index is expected to be\nequal to 2 [27] .\n\u2022 Regardless of the relative amount of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , we expect N\u03bd\u03bc = N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc . However,\nN\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde depends on the initial composition of \u03c0 + to \u03c0 \u2212 which in turn depends on the\ndetails of the model.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nUncertainties and their impact on \u03b813 measurement\n\nOur knowledge of the sources of the cosmic neutrinos is quite limited and mostly speculative.\nA myriad of known and un-known effects can cause deviation of the initial flux from the\nstandard picture that was described in the previous section. In this section, we compare\nthe effect of a deviation from the standard picture on R with the effect of a nonzero s13 .\nHere, we assume that the neutrino mass matrix conserves CP. A discussion of CP-violation\nis given in sect. 5.\nLet us fix our convention for the mixing angles. Here, we use the standard parametrization\nof PDG [28] for the neutrino mixing matrix with [29]\n\u03c0\n0 \u2264 \u03b813 < 0.2 <\nand 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 2\u03c0 .\n2\nThe sensitivity of P\u03b1\u03b2 on the phase \u03b4 is through sin \u03b813 cos \u03b4; so the CP-conserving cases with\n\u03b4 = 0 and \u03b4 = \u03c0 will have distinct effects. We will consider both cases. Throughout this\nsection we take we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0.\nIn sect. 4.1, we discuss the effect of the variation of the spectrum on ratio R. In sect. 4.2,\nwe discuss the dependence of R on N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde . Sect. 4.3 gives a brief discussion of the neutrino\nnucleon uncertainty and its effects.\n\n4.1\n\nEnergy spectrum of incoming flux\n\nAs mentioned before, in the standard picture, the neutrino flux follows a power-law spectrum\nof form Eq. (13) with \u03b1 = 2. However, more careful considerations of the details of the Fermi\nacceleration and the properties of the target particles show that \u03b1 can deviate from 2 and\ntake any value in the range (1,3) [16, 30, 31].\nThe energies of the muons and showers entering a neutrino telescope can be measured.\nHowever, extracting the energy of the incoming neutrinos that induce such events is not\nstraightforward. In the case of \u03bc-track events, the muon can lose a substantial part of its\nenergy before entering the detector. On the other hand, limiting the analysis to the muons\nproduced inside the detector will reduce the statistics. In the case of the shower-like events\noriginating from the NC interaction of neutrinos, the energy of the shower does not give the\nenergy of the initial neutrino because a part of the energy is carried away by the final neutrino\nwhich escapes detection. Nevertheless, it is shown in [20] that for E\u03bd2 dF\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 0.25 GeV\ncm\u22122 sr\u22121 yr\u22121 after one year of data-taking, \u03b1 can be determined with 10 % uncertainty.\n8\n\n\f3.1\n\n\u03b1=1.8\n3 \u03b1=2.0\n\u03b1=2.2\n\n2.9\n2.8\nR\n2.7\n2.6\n2.5\n2.4\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\nSin2\u03b813\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nFigure 1: The dependence of R on sin2 \u03b813 for different values of the spectral index, \u03b1. The\nthicker lines correspond to \u03b4 = \u03c0 and the thinner ones correspond to \u03b4 = 0. We have used\nthe central values for the neutrino-nucleon cross section [22] and have set N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde = 0.5 and\n(N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc + N\u03bd\u03bc )/(N\u03bd\u0304e + N\u03bde ) = 2. The input for \u03b812 and \u03b823 are set equal to the best fit in [29]. The\nvertical line at 0.041 shows the present bound at 3\u03c3 [29].\n\nFig. 1 shows R versus sin2 \u03b813 for cos \u03b4 = \u00b11 and various values of \u03b1. As seen from the\nfigure when \u03b4 = 0, the sensitivity of R to s213 is very mild and less than 2 %. That is while\nfor cos \u03b4 = \u22121, the sensitivity to s213 is about 10 %. The disparity between cos \u03b4 = +1 and\ncos \u03b4 = \u22121 means that for s213 \u223c 0.04, the contributions from s13 cos \u03b4 and s213 are comparable.\nIn fact, expanding R in powers of s13 confirms this claim:\nR \u2243 r1 + r2 s13 cos \u03b4 + r3 s213 cos2 \u03b4,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere for the central curve with \u03b1 = 2.0, r1 \u2243 2.55, r2 \u2243 \u22120.66 and r3 \u2243 2.65. If \u03b823 deviates\nfrom \u03c0/4, in addition to the s213 cos2 \u03b4 term, a term proportional to s213 has to be added to\nEq. (14).\nAs seen from the figure, even for cos \u03b4 = \u22121, the sensitivity to s213 can be obscured by\nthe 10 % uncertainty in \u03b1. However, for s213 > 0.02, the bands between \u03b1 = 2.2 and 1.8 for\ncos \u03b4 = 1 and cos \u03b4 = \u22121 have no overlap. This means that for s213 > 0.02, 10 % precision in\n\u03b1 is enough to distinguish cos \u03b4 = 1 from cos \u03b4 = \u22121.\n9\n\n\fNotice that the curve with \u03b1 = 2 is closer to that with \u03b1 = 2.2 than that with \u03b1 = 1.8.\nThis means that the effect of the uncertainty decreases by increasing the value of \u03b1.\n3.1\np=1.0\np=0.5\np=0.3\np=0.1\np=0.0\n\n3\n2.9\n2.8\nR\n2.7\n2.6\n2.5\n2.4\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\nSin \u03b813\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n2\n\nFigure 2: The dependence of R on sin2 \u03b813 for different values of the p parameter defined in Eq.

The vertical line\nat 0.041 shows the present bound at 3\u03c3 [29].\n\nConsidering the unknown nature of the production mechanism, it is not dismissed that\nthe energy spectrum of neutrinos does not follow a simple power-law form. For example\nthe spectrum can be a sum of two power-law functions each originating from a separate\nmechanism (i.e., aE \u2212\u03b11 + bE \u2212\u03b12 ). We study such a possibility in Fig. 2, where we have taken\nthe shape of the spectrum to be of the form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE \u22121\n\u22122\nE +p\n,\n(15)\n100 TeV\nwhere p is a dimensionless parameter that determines the magnitude of the second term.\nBoth terms can originate from the Fermi acceleration mechanism [32]. Notice that the second\nterm is subdominant. The curves from up to down respectively correspond to p = 1, 0.5,\n0.3, 0.1 and 0. As seen from the figure, the uncertainty on p obscures the extraction of the\nmixing angle \u03b813 .\n\n10\n\n\f4.2\n\nUncertainty in N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde\n\nSince the source is made of matter rather than anti-matter, we in general expect \u03c0 + to\ndominate over \u03c0 \u2212 and therefore 0 < N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde < 1. There is not any established or proposed method for determining N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde in the neutrino telescopes in the energy interval\n(100 GeV, 100 TeV). As a result, this ratio appears as a source of uncertainty in determination of R. Curves in the Fig. 3 show the dependence of R on sin2 \u03b813 for two extreme values\n\u03bb \u2261 N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde = 0 and \u03bb = 1. For \u03b4 = \u03c0, the variation of N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde in the interval [0, 1] causes\na change in R of about 5 % which can obscure the determination of s13 . Notice that for\ns213 > 0.005 the bands between \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = 0 for \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b4 = \u03c0 are separate, so the\nuncertainty in \u03bb will not cause a problem for discriminating between cos \u03b4 = \u00b11.\n3\n2.9\n\n\u03bb=0\n\u03bb=1\n\n2.8\nR\n\n2.7\n2.6\n2.5\n2.4\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\nSin \u03b813\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n2\n\nFigure 3: The dependence of R on sin2 \u03b813 for different values of the parameters \u03bb \u2261 N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde .\nThe thicker lines correspond to \u03b4 = \u03c0 and the thinner ones correspond to \u03b4 = 0. The spectral index\nhas been set equal to 2. The rest of the input parameters are the same as in Fig. (1).\n\n4.3\n\nUncertainties in cross sections\n\nTo calculate the cross section, information on the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of\nthe nucleon is needed. The center of mass energy of a system composed of a neutrino with\nenergy E\u03bd \u223c 100 TeV incident on a proton at rest is (2E\u03bd mp )1/2 = 450 GeV. The center\n11\n\n\fof mass energy of the e \u2212 p HERA collider is about 320 GeV. Thus, to calculate \u03c3\u03bdN in\nthe energy range relevant for this study (i.e., 100 GeV . E\u03bd . 100 TeV) the results of the\nHERA experiment can be employed. The current uncertainty on the PDFs is about 3 %\n[33]. LHC can further improve the precision of the PDFs.\nThe uncertainty in the cross section of all types of neutrinos (each flavor of neutrino and\nanti-neutrino) originates from the same uncertainties in the PDFs. As a result, the resultant\nuncertainty in the numerator and denominator of R cancel each other so the certainty in the\ncross section will not be a limiting factor for determining \u03b813 (or \u03b4) from the cosmic neutrino\nflavor composition.\n\n5\n\nDetermination of \u03b4\n\nIn the literature it is suggested to derive the Dirac CP-violating phase (\u03b4) by studying the\nflavor composition of the cosmic neutrinos [12, 13, 14]. Considering the expenses and challenges before measuring this phase through the more conventional proposals (i.e., neutrino\nfactory or superbeam methods), it is worth giving this possibility a thorough consideration.\nHowever, in the literature the flavor identification power of the detector has not been realistically treated. To be specific, the quantities that have been previously analyzed in the\ncontext of deriving \u03b4 are ratios such as R\u2032 \u2261 F\u03bd\u03bc /(F\u03bde + F\u03bd\u03c4 ) [12, 13, 14] which cannot be\ndirectly derived at neutrino telescopes. In this section, we assess the possibility of measuring\n\u03b4 considering realistic flavor identification power of neutrino telescopes (i.e., studying ratio\nR) and taking into account various sources of uncertainty for the first time.\nBy the time a statistically significant number of cosmic neutrino events is collected, we\nexpect noticeable improvement in determination of the input parameters. In particular, in\nthe case that the parameters are in favorable range, we expect progress in the following\nmeasurements:\n\u2022 If sin2 \u03b813 is close to the present bound, the forthcoming experiments can measure its\nvalue with a precision of \u2206 sin2 \u03b813 :\nsin2 \u03b813 = sin2 \u03b8\u030413 (1 \u00b1 \u2206sin2 \u03b813 / sin2 \u03b8\u030413 ).\nIn fact, for relatively large values of sin2 \u03b813 , the uncertainty \u2206sin2 \u03b813 / sin2 \u03b8\u030413 can be\nreduced to as small as 5 % [34, 35].\n12\n\n\f\u2022 In case that statistically significant number of cosmic neutrinos are collected, R can\nbe measured with an uncertainty of \u2206R:\nR = R\u0304(1 \u00b1 \u2206R/R\u0304).\nAs shown in [20], a precision of \u2206R/R\u0304 \u2243 7% can be obtained provided that the\nnumber of events exceeds \u223c 300. This would be achieved with a neutrino flux of\nE\u03bd2 dF\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 0.25 GeV cm\u22122 sr\u22121 yr\u22121 after a couple of years of data-taking.\n\u2022 The forthcoming long-baseline [36] and reactor neutrino [37] experiments can respectively measure the solar and atmospheric mixing angles by a precision of \u223c 6 %. That\nis\nsin2 \u03b812 = sin2 \u03b8\u030412 (1 \u00b1 6%),\nsin2 \u03b823 = sin2 \u03b8\u030423 (1 \u00b1 6%).\nThe present best-fit values are sin2 \u03b8\u030412 = 0.32 and sin2 \u03b8\u030423 = 0.5.\nRemember that the ratio N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde cannot be measured. Since the initial jets creating\nthe charged pions (and subsequently the neutrinos) are mainly made of protons rather than\nanti-protons, we expect N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde \u2264 1. Considering all these uncertainties, the question is\nwhether it will be possible to extract the value of \u03b4.\nFig. 4 addresses this question. Drawing the plot, we have assumed that R\u0304 will be found to\nhave a typical value of 2.53 with an uncertainty of \u2206R/R\u0304. This value of R\u0304 can be obtained\nby taking maximal CP-violation (\u03b4 = \u03c0/2), sin2 \u03b813 = 0.03, we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0,\n\u03b1 = 2 and N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde = 0.5 . We have looked for solutions in the \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b1 plane for which\nR = 2.53(1 \u00b1 \u2206R/R\u0304), varying the rest of the relevant parameters in the ranges indicated in\nthe caption of Fig. 4. The regions covered with dots, little triangles and crosses respectively\ncorrespond to 7%, 1.5% and 1% precision in the measurement of R. Notice that the figure is\nsymmetric under \u03b4 \u2192 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4. The symmetry originates from the fact that the dependence\nof R on \u03b4 is through cos \u03b4. As mentioned earlier, \u03b1 can be independently determined by\nthe measurement of the energy spectrum with about 10% precision. (For \u03b1 = 2, the direct\nmeasurement of the energy spectrum can restrict the value of \u03b1 to the region between the\nvertical lines at \u03b1 = 1.8 and 2.2.) As seen from the figure, with \u2206R/R\u0304 = 7%, \u03b4 cannot\nbe constrained. In fact, any point between the vertical lines can be a solution. The figure\nshows that reducing \u2206R/R\u0304 to 1 % (but keeping the rest of the uncertainties as before), some\nparts of the solutions can be excluded. In particular, the region around \u03b4 = \u03c0 will not be a\n13\n\n\f2\u03c0\n7%\n1.5%\n1%\n3\u03c0/2\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n0\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\nFigure 4: Points in the (\u03b1, \u03b4) space consistent with R = 2.53\u00b1\u2206R.

Notice that along with \u03b4 = \u03c0/2, \u03b4 = 0 is also a solution. This means that\ndespite maximal CP-violation, the CP-violation cannot still be established. We examined\nthe robustness of this result. We found that reducing the uncertainties in the mixing angles\n(even in \u03b813 ) will not noticeably change the overall conclusion. However, the sensitivity to\n\u2206R/R\u0304 seems to be high. Notice that with a precision of \u2206R/R\u0304 = 1.5%, there are some\nregions of solutions (covered by the triangles) that can be excluded if the uncertainty is\nreduced to 1% (i.e., they are not covered with crosses). As we will see below, the sensitivity\nto power index is also high.\nDrawing Figs. (5-a,5-b), we have respectively taken R\u0304 = 3.3 (corresponding to \u03b1 = 1)\nand R\u0304 = 3.59 (corresponding to \u03b1 = 3). The rest of the input is the same as Fig. (4).\nFrom Fig. (5-b) we observe that for \u03b1 = 3, the measurement of R with 7% uncertainty\ndetermines \u03b1 with better than 6 % precision which will probably be more accurate than the\ndirect determination of \u03b1 from the energy spectrum measurement. Notice that when \u03b1 = 1\nor 3, even a precision of \u2206R/R\u0304 = 1% will not be enough to constrain \u03b4. However, from\nFig. (5-a) we observe that in case of \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b4 = \u03c0/2, if the error in direct measurement\n14\n\n\f2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n7%\n1%\n\n7%\n1%\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n\u03b4\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3\n\u03b1\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5: The same as Fig. 4 except that in figure (a), we have taken R\u0304 = 3.30 (corresponding to\n\u03b1 = 1) and in figure (b), we have taken R\u0304 = 3.59 (corresponding to \u03b1 = 3).

In fact, the\npresent uncertainty (i.e., sin2 \u03b823 = 0.50+0.18\n\u22120.16 at 3\u03c3 c.l. [29]) leads to a sizeable uncertainty\nof \u223c 20 % in R. As mentioned earlier the forthcoming experiments [37] can improve the\nprecision of sin2 \u03b823 to 6 %. A variation of 6% in sin2 \u03b823 leads to a \u223c 4 % change in R\nwhich is comparable to the effect of cos \u03b4 for sin2 \u03b813 = 0.03. To pinpoint the effect of the\nuncertainty of \u03b823 on R, we have presented Fig. 6. The input of Fig. 6 is similar to Fig. 4\nbut to study the effect of \u03b823 , we have fixed N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde , \u03b812 and \u03b813 to their central values.\nComparing Figs. 4 and 6, we find that improving the precision of sin2 \u03b823 from 6% to 1% can\nhelp us to remove a substantial part of the spurious solutions. Especially for \u2206R/R\u0304 = 1%\nsolutions with 3\u03c0/4 < \u03b4 < 5\u03c0/4 can be removed by reducing the uncertainty of sin2 \u03b823 to\n1 %.\n\n15\n\n\f2\u03c0\n7%\n1%\n3\u03c0/2\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\n2.2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 6: Points in the (\u03b1, \u03b4) space consistent with R = 2.53 \u00b1 \u2206R.

To draw this figure we have fixed sin2 \u03b813 = 0.0301, sin2 \u03b812 = 0.32,\nN\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde = 0.5 and varied sin2 \u03b823 in 0.5(1 \u00b1 1%).\n\n6\n\nInitial flavor composition\n\nIn the previous sections, in accordance with the \"standard picture\", we had assumed that\nwe0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0. Various mechanisms can intervene to cause a deviation from this\nsimple prediction. For example, in the so-called stopped muon scenario, the muon production\ntakes place inside a high magnetic field so the muons come to rest before decay. As a result,\nthe neutrinos produced from the decay of the muon would be below the detection energy\nthreshold. This effectively leads to we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0 : 1 : 0 [30]. On the other hand, a\ncontribution from neutron decay, n \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e pe\u2212 , would increase we0 /w\u03bc0 . Even in the standard\npicture, along with the production of \u03c0 \u00b1 , charged Kaons can also be produced in the jets.\nLike the case of the charged pions, the main decay mode of charged Kaon is K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc , so\nneglecting the subdominant modes Br(K \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ) = 3.3% and Br(K \u2192 \u03c0 0 e\u03bde ) = 5% [28],\nwe would naively expect that flavor composition of the neutrinos from the Kaon chain also\nfollow the standard picture (i.e., we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 \u2243 1 : 2 : 0) but there is a subtlety here. In the\nchain process, \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc \u2192 \u03bde \u03bd\u03bc e, the average energy of each of the produced neutrinos in\n16\n\n\fthe rest frame of the pion is about m\u03c0 /4. That is while in the case of Kaon decay, the average\nenergies of the neutrinos are different: The energy of \u03bd\u03bc produced directly from the Kaon\ndecay in the Kaon rest frame is (m2K \u2212 m2\u03bc )/(2mK ) \u2243 236 MeV; that is while, the average\nenergies of the neutrinos from the secondary muon are [(m2K + m2\u03bc )/(2mK )]/3 \u2243 86 MeV.\nAs a result, limiting the detection to an energy range (e.g., (100 GeV,100TeV)) the ratio\nRE\nRE\nwe0 : w\u03bc0 (i.e., Ethcut (dF\u03bd0e /dE + dF\u03bd\u03040e /dE)dE : Ethcut (dF\u03bd0\u03bc /dE + dF\u03bd\u03040\u03bc /dE)dE) will deviate\nfrom 1:2. In fact, the ratio we0 : w\u03bc0 would depend on the energy spectrum of the initial\ncharged Kaon.\nThe mechanisms that we pointed out above are all processes that expected to exist and\nplay at least a subdominant role within the framework of the mainstream models. None\nof these mechanisms creates \u03c4 neutrino or anti-neutrino at the sources (i.e., they all yield\nwe0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = we0 : w\u03bc0 : 0). However, more exotic mechanisms can be at work to create \u03bd\u03c4 or\n\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 at source: In principle, the collision of pp or p\u03b3 at the source can create D meson whose\ndecay can produce \u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . According to [38], the contribution of the D meson to the\nneutrino flux becomes important only for E\u03bd > 105 TeV. For lower values of energy in which\nwe are interested in, the contribution is about three orders of magnitude below the present\nbound. To our best knowledge, within the Standard Model (SM) of particles, in the energy\nrange 100 GeV-100 TeV, w\u03c40 remains much smaller than w\u03bc0 and we0 . However, if neutrinos\nhave some yet unexplored properties beyond SM, tau neutrinos or anti-neutrinos can be\nproduced at the source. For example, suppose neutrinos posses tiny transition magnetic\nmoments of form\n\u03bc\u03c4 e F\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bdeT C\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03bd\u03c4\n\nand/or \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc F\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bd\u03bcT C\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03bd\u03c4 .\n\n(16)\n\nThere are strong bounds on the transition moments, |\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 |, from different terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations [28, 39]:\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2 < 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 \u03bcB ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. The magnetic field inside the source can be so large that\neven a transition moment as tiny as 10\u221213 \u03bcB can lead to a sizeable production of tau neutrino\nand anti-neutrino at the source [40]. In fact according to the models [41], it is possible to\nhave\n\n\u0012\n\nB\n109 Gauss\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nL\n108 cm\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\n10\u221213 \u03bcB\n\n\u0013\n\n&1\n\n(18)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field and L is the linear size of the volume in which the magnetic\nfield is as large as B. If condition (18) is fulfilled, the flavor composition at source will\n17\n\n\fconsiderably deviate from the standard 1 : 2 : 0. Let us normalize the initial flavor ratio\nsuch that w\u03bc0 = 1:\nwe0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = we0 : 1 : w\u03c40 .\nIn this section, we discuss whether by merely studying R and without theoretical prejudice,\none can extract we0 and w\u03c40 . Actually, the possibility of deriving information on we0 and w\u03c40\nfrom the measurement of the flavor ratio at the detector has been discussed in the literature\n[42]. Like the case of measurement of neutrino parameters, the flavor identification power\nof the neutrino telescopes has not been realistically treated in the previous studies. Here\nwe investigate this possibility considering realistic flavor identification power of neutrino\ntelescopes (i.e., studying ratio R) and taking into account various sources of uncertainty for\nthe first time.\nThere is a subtle point here. If within the lifetime of the ICECUBE (or a more advanced\nneutrino telescope) neutrino flux from a GRB in a close-by galaxy (a \u223c 5 Mpc far away\ngalaxy) is detected, the statistics will be high enough to extract information on the flavor\ncomposition of the flux from this individual source. For sources located at cosmological\ndistances (& 100 Mpc), the best can be done is to combine the information from different\nsources. Each source may be different and emit neutrino flux with a different flavor composition. From the \"average\" R, only \"average\" values of we0 and w\u03c40 over these sources can be\nderived.\nTaking into account the relevant uncertainties in the input parameters, we look for values\nof we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 that are consistent with R = R\u0304 \u00b1 \u2206R. To perform this analysis, we take\n\u03b813 = 0. For any other value of \u03b813 , the same analysis can be repeated. The results are robust\nagainst the variation of \u03b813 within the present bound. If \u03b813 = 0, by the time that enough\ncosmic neutrinos are collected, the Daya-Bay [43] and Double-Chooz [35] experiments can\nset the bound sin2 \u03b813 < 0.003. We vary sin2 \u03b813 between zero and 0.003. In this case, there\nis no hope of measuring \u03b4 so we allow \u03b4 to vary between 0 and 2\u03c0. We take the energy\nspectrum to be of form E \u22122 and assume that its power-law behavior will be established and\nthe spectral index will be measured with 10 % precision. Again, we vary N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde within\n[0,1].\nIn Fig. (7), we consider two possibilities: (i) the standard case with we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0.5 :\n1 : 0 leading to R\u0304 = 2.53 (see Fig. 7-a); (ii) the case of stopped muons with we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 =\n0 : 1 : 0 yielding R\u0304 = 3.20 (see Fig. 7-b). From these figures we observe that with a precision\nof \u2206R/R\u0304 = 7%, these two scenarios can be easily discriminated. These two can also be\n18\n\n\f4\n\n4\n\n7%\n3.5 1%\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n0\nw\u03c4\n\n7%\n1%\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n0\nw\u03c4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n\u2605\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n0\nwe\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\u2605\n0\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n0\nwe\n\n(a)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Points in the (we0 , w\u03c40 ) plane consistent with R = R\u0304 \u00b1 \u2206R.

Drawing Fig. (a), we\nhave taken R\u0304 = 2.53 which corresponds to the standard picture with we0 = 1/2 and w\u03c40 = 0. In case\nFig. (b), we have set R\u0304 = 3.2 which corresponds to the stopped muon scenario with we0 = w\u03c40 = 0.\n4\n7%\n3.5 1%\n3\n2.5\nw0\u03c4\n\n2\n1.5\n\n\u2605\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nw0e\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFigure 8: The same as Fig. 7 except that R\u0304 is set equal to 1.96, which corresponds to we0 : w\u03bc0 :\nw\u03c40 = 4 : 1 : 1.\n\n19\n\n\fdiscriminated from the scenario in which the neutrino production mechanism is n \u2192 pe\u03bd\u0304e\n(i.e., we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 0 : 0). When we restrict the analysis to w\u03c40 = 0 (i.e., the case\nwithout exotic neutrino properties) from these figures we observe that the measurement of\nR stringently constrains we0 : w\u03c40 which in turn sheds light on the production mechanism.\nHowever, once the assumption of w\u03c40 is relaxed, a wide range of we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 can be a\nsolution. For example, the exotic case of we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0 : 0 : 1 leads to the same value of\nR\u0304 as the stopped muon scenario.\nThe input for Fig. 8 is the same as that for Fig. 7 except that in Fig. 8 we0 : w\u03bc0 :\nw\u03c40 = 4 : 1 : 1 . For this flavor ratio, the central value of R is R\u0304 = 1.96 . Notice that with\n\u2206R/R\u0304, this exotic flavor ratio can be discriminated from the two standard cases that we\nhave mentioned. That is we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0.5 : 1 : 0 or we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0 : 1 : 0 are not\nsolutions for R = 1.96(1 \u00b1 7%) .\n\n7\n\nConclusions and Discussions\n\nUnder the assumption that the initial flavor ratios at the source were we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0,\nwe have studied the possibility of deriving \u03b813 and/or \u03b4 from cosmic neutrinos taking into\naccount various uncertainties.\nICECUBE and other neutrino telescopes that are going to collect neutrino events in the\nenergy range 100 GeV < E\u03bd < 100 TeV will be sensitive only to two types of events; i.e.,\nshower-like and \u03bc-track events. The ratio of these two, R, yields only one piece of information\non the mixing parameters. Under the assumption of CP conservation, cos \u03b4 = \u00b11, we have\ndiscussed the possibility of extracting s13 from the measurement of R. We have found that\nfor cos \u03b4 = 1, the sensitivity of R to s213 is very mild. For cos \u03b4 = 1, the derivation of s13\nfrom R would require measurement of R with a precision better than 2 % which does not\nseem achievable. In the case of cos \u03b4 = \u22121, as s213 varies between zero and the present upper\nbound, R changes by 10 % which is in principle resolvable by ICECUBE [20].\nWe have found that a 10 % uncertainty in the energy spectrum (to be precise, 10 %\nuncertainty in the spectral index in Eq. (13)) is a major source of error in the derivation\nof s13 . However, for s213 > 0.02, the solutions with cos \u03b4 = 1 and cos \u03b4 = \u22121 can be\ndistinguished despite a 10 % uncertainty in the spectral index. We have also studied the\neffect of a deviation from the power-law spectrum. Our conclusion is that in order to derive\n\n20\n\n\fs13 from R, a precision better than 5 % in the measurement of the energy spectrum is\nrequired.\nWe have also studied the effects of the variation of the neutrino to anti-neutrino ratio\non R. We have found that when N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde (see Eq. (13) for the definition) varies between 0\nand 1, R changes by 5 % which is comparable to the effect of s13 . Unfortunately with the\ncurrent techniques, it is not possible to measure N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde in the energy range 100 GeV <\nE\u03bd < 100 TeV so this source of uncertainty cannot be eliminated by measurement and one\nshould rely on the models to predict the value of N\u03bd\u0304e /N\u03bde .\nThe uncertainty in the neutrino nucleon cross section, \u03c3\u03bdN , induces relatively large uncertainty in the evaluation of the shower-like and \u03bc-track events. However, when we take their\nratio, the uncertainties cancel each other out so the derivation of the neutrino parameters\nfrom R does not suffer from the uncertainty in \u03c3\u03bdN .\nWe have then studied the possibility of deriving \u03b4 from the cosmic neutrino flavor composition assuming that s13 will be measured by other experiments with a reasonable precision.\nSince the dependence of the oscillation probabilities of the cosmic neutrinos on \u03b4 is through\ncos \u03b4, there is a symmetry under \u03b4 \u2192 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the\nCP-odd combination P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) \u2212 P (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) (which is proposed to be measured by neutrino factory or superbeam facilities) to \u03b4 is through sin \u03b4 and would therefore suffer from\na degeneracy under \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4. To resolve the latter degeneracy, it is suggested to employ\nvarious baselines [44] and/or study the energy dependence of the oscillation probability [45].\nDerivation of cos \u03b4 from the cosmic neutrino flavor composition can be considered as an\nalternative method to solve this degeneracy. We have studied the effects induced by the\nerror in the mixing angles (\u03b812 , \u03b823 and \u03b813 ) and the measurement of R as well as by the\nuncertainties in neutrino-antineutrino ratio and the energy spectra. We have found that\neven with a precision of 1% in R, CP cannot be established. That is even for the maximal\nCP-violation (\u03b4 = \u03c0/2), \u03b4 = 0 cannot be ruled out. However, in this case, \u03b4 = \u03c0 can be\nexcluded provided that \u2206R/R\u0304 is reduced to less than 1%.\nWithin the SM of the particles, various mechanisms can deviate w\u03bc0 /we0 from 2 but within\nthe energy range 100 GeV < E\u03bd < 100 TeV, w\u03c40 still remains much smaller than we0 and\nw\u03bc0 . The conditions in the source of cosmic neutrinos are so extreme that the beyond SM\nproperties of neutrinos can play a role to significantly distort the initial flavor ratio of the\ncosmic neutrinos. In particular, a nonzero \u03bc\u03c4 e or \u03bc\u03c4 \u03bc transition moment close to the present\nbound can lead to w\u03c40 \u223c w\u03bc0 \u223c we0 . In the second part of the paper, we have relaxed the\n21\n\n\fassumption we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0 and have studied the possibility of extracting the\ninitial we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 from the cosmic neutrino data. We have found that with a precision of\n\u2206R/R\u0304 = 7%, one can discriminate between the standard picture with we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 1 : 2 : 0\nand the stopped muon scenario with we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 = 0 : 1 : 0. When based on theoretical\nprejudice, we restrict the analysis to w\u03c40 = 0, we find that w\u03bc0 /we0 can be constrained with\nreasonable accuracy but relaxing w\u03c40 = 0 will open up the possibility of different solutions.\nWe have also enumerated a number of other effects that can be comparable to that of\nnonzero s13 but have been overlooked in the literature. Calculating these effects requires the\nknowledge of details of the detector and the shape of the neutrino spectrum. Uncertainty\nin this knowledge will lead further uncertainty in the determination of \u03b4 and \u03b813 . As we\ndemonstrated in the present paper, even in the absence of these effects, the uncertainties are\ntoo large to allow for the determination of \u03b4 and \u03b813 . Potential uncertainties in these effects\nwill further confirm this conclusion. For the purpose of establishing substantial deviation\nof we0 : w\u03bc0 : w\u03c40 from 1 : 2 : 0, these effects have to be taken into account however the\nuncertainties in the evaluation of these effects are not expected to be so large to change\nour positive conclusion in the second part of this paper. Throughout this paper, we have\nassumed that the propagation of the cosmic neutrinos from the source to the detector is\ngoverned by the standard oscillation formula. The effects of a deviation from the standard\noscillation probability will be presented elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors are grateful to R. Gandhi, M. H. Reno, M. M Sheikh-Jabbari and A.

In the rest frame of \u03c4 , the partial decay rate of an unpolarized\n\n22\n\n\f\u03c4 is given by the following well-known formula (see [46])\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4E\u03bc\u2032\n12\n1 d 2 \u0393\u2032\n1\u2212\nE\u03bc\u20322 ,\n=\n\u0393\u2032 dE\u03bc\u2032 d\u03a9\u2032\n\u03c0m3\u03c4\n3m\u03c4\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the effects of m2\u03bc /m2\u03c4 \u226a 1 are neglected. Quantities in the rest frame of the decaying\n\u03c4 lepton are denoted by a prime. In the rest frame of the \u03c4 lepton, 0 < E\u03bc\u2032 < m\u03c4 /2. The\nnumber of emitted muons in certain direction within the solid angle d\u03a9\u2032 and with energy in\nthe interval [E\u03bc\u2032 , E\u03bc\u2032 + dE\u03bc\u2032 ] is a Lorentz invariant quantity:\n1 d 2 \u0393\u2032\n1 d2 \u0393\ndE\u03bc d\u03a9 = \u2032\ndE\u03bc\u2032 d\u03a9\u2032 .\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u0393 dE\u03bc d\u03a9\n\u0393 dE\u03bc d\u03a9\n\n(20)\n\nFrom this equality, we obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 d2 \u0393\n4\n12\n1\u2212\n\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)E\u03bc \u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)E\u03bc2 dE\u03bc sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6, (21)\ndE\u03bc d\u03a9 =\n\u0393 dE\u03bc d\u03a9\n\u03c0m3\u03c4\n3m\u03c4\np\nwhere \u03b3 = E\u03c4 /m\u03c4 and \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 1/\u03b3 2 . The z-axis is taken along the direction of motion of\n\u03c4 . The quantities E\u03bc , \u03b8 and \u03c6 take values in the following intervals\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0,\nwhere\n\u03b8max\n\n0 < E\u03bc <\n\nE\u03c4\n(1 + \u03b2),\n2\n\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8max\n\n(22)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\u0015\n1\nm\u03c4\n= arccos max\n1\u2212\n, \u22121 .\n\u03b2\n2\u03b3E\u03bc\n\n(23)\n\nBy integrating over \u03b8 and \u03c6 in Eq.
