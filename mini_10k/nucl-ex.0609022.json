Recent data from the NA45, NA49 and NA57 collaborations are\ndiscussed and compared to earlier measurements by WA98 and NA45 at the same\ncenter-of-mass energies, as well as to measurements at the higher energies by the\nRHIC experiments. The observables include new p+p, A+A spectra, nuclear modification factors (RAA , RCP ), two particle azimuthal correlations, and baryon to\nmeson ratios at moderately high pt . Generally, the interpretation of the SPS data\nsuffers from the lack of reliable baseline measurements (p+p and p+A). However,\nthe overall picture that is emerging suggests that already at SPS energies medium\neffects similar to those observed at RHIC are present.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt RHIC energies a strong suppression of high pt hadron production in nucleus\u2013\nnucleus collisions relative to p+p collisions has been observed [1,2], which is\nusually attributed to the energy loss that the parent partons experience when\ntransversing the color deconfined medium present in these collisions [3]. Also,\ntwo particle correlations at high pt indicate a strong effect of the produced\nmedium on the hadron emission pattern. At the lower SPS energies on the\nother hand, the experimental situation was rather unclear and even contradictory. While, e.g. the energy density derived from the measured Et distributions, as well as the fact that the chemical freeze-out occurs very close to the\ntheoretically expected phase boundary, suggest that a quark gluon plasma is\nalready formed at top SPS energies [4], there was so far no indication of any\nhigh pt suppression at these energies. In fact, the WA98 data on the nuclear\nmodification factor RAA of neutral pions rather exhibited a Cronin\u2013type of\nenhancement [5]. However, a reassessment of the p+p baseline [6] allowed the\nconclusion that the data on pion production in central A+A reactions are consistent with the expectation in a jet quenching scenario with gluon densities of\ndNg /dy = 400 \u2212 600 [7], more in line with the measured hadron multiplicities.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n5 February 2018\n\n\f3\n\nEd \u03c3(p(d)+A)/dp\nA Ed3\u03c3(p+p)/dp3\n\np(d) + A \u2192 \u03c0\u00b1 / \u03c00 + X\np \u2248 1.5 GeV/c\nt\np \u2248 3.0 GeV/c\nt\np \u2248 4.6 GeV/c\nt\np \u2248 6.2 GeV/c\n\n3\n\n10\n\nt\n\nRpA =\n\n3\n\nRpA =\n\ns = 12GeV, p+Pb \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X Abramov 81\ns = 19GeV, p+W \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X Antreasyan 79\ns = 24GeV, p+W \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X Antreasyan 79\ns = 27GeV, p+W \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X Antreasyan 79\ns = 32GeV, p+Cu \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X Apanasevich 05\ns = 39GeV, p+Cu \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X Apanasevich 05\ns = 200GeV, d+Au \u2192 \u03c0 0 + X Adler 03\ns = 200GeV, d+Au \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X Adams 05\n\n3\n\nEd \u03c3(p(d)+A)/dp\nA Ed3\u03c3(p+p)/dp3\n\n102\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\npt (GeV/c)\n\n102\ns (GeV)\n\nFig. 1.

Right: RpA at\n\u221a\ndifferent fixed momenta as a function of sNN . The grey band indicates the SPS\ncenter-of-mass energy.\n\nA first study of two particle azimuthal correlations for pt > 1.2 GeV/c by the\nNA45 experiment [8], showed a structure that could be interpreted as a correlation of semi-hard particles on top of a collective flow component. Similar to\nwhat has been seen at RHIC, the away-side peaks broadens with centrality,\nwhich might be attributed to in-medium effects. Recently, new data on RCP\nfor identified particles have been presented by the NA49 and NA57 experiment\n[9,10]. Additionally, the NA45 collaboration has done a refined analysis of two\nparticle azimuthal correlations at high pt [11]. These data help to clarify the\ncurrent situation and shall be discussed in the following.\n\n2\n\nBaseline measurements in p+p and p+A\n\nIn order to establish whether any kind of modification in the high pt region\nis present in A+A collisions, reference data from p+p and p+A collisions\nare\n\u221a of high importance. Unfortunately, there are no p+p(A) data available at\ns = 17.3 GeV that cover the interesting pt -region for A+A studies above\n2 GeV/c. Recently, the NA49 experiment has published charged pion spectra\nmeasured at this center-of-mass energy [12], but the statistics limits the pt reach to 2.1 GeV/c. Several attempts have been made to replace the missing\ndata by an interpolation from lower and higher beam energies [5,6]. In [6]\nthe parametrization suggested by Blattnig et al. [13] was used to construct a\np+p baseline for neutral pions. This parametrization also agrees\n\u221a to the charge\naveraged pion spectra in the region measured by NA49 at s = 17.3 GeV.\n2\n\n\fRAA\n\n3\nPb+Pb(Au) @ s = 17.3 GeV\nNA49: (\u03c0++\u03c0-)/2 (5%)\nWA98: \u03c00 (11%)\n2\n\nNA45: (\u03c0++\u03c0-)/2 (5%)\n+\n\np+W \u2192 (\u03c0 +\u03c0-)/2\n\n1\n\nGLV, dNg/dy = 400 - 600\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\npt (GeV/c)\nFig. 2. The nuclear modification factor RAA as a function of pt for neutral and averaged charged pions [5,20,9]. The hatched box represents the typical normalization\nerror from the hNcoll i determination. The lower hatched band is a theory prediction\nincluding energy loss, Cronin effect and nuclear shadowing [7]. The upper dashed\n\u221a\nband shows RpA as measured in p+W at sNN = 19.4 GeV/c [16].\n\nHowever, one should keep in mind that at the center-of-mass energies under\ndiscussion here, the spectral shape in the higher pt region (i.e. above pt =\n2 GeV/c) changes drastically with energy since the kinematic limit becomes\nimportant here (see e.g. [14]). Therefore, any parametrization introduces a\nlarge systematic error. A specific problem in the interpretation of the SPS\ndata arises from the fact that the typical pt -reach is in the region below 4\u2013\n5 GeV/c. This region is governed by an interplay of the Cronin effect, which\ncauses an enhancement in p+A collisions relative to p+p, and a potential\nsuppression due to jet quenching. A proper understanding of the p+A data is\ntherefore indispensable. This is illustrated by Fig. 1 that shows the existing\ndata on the nuclear modification factor RpA at different center-of-mass energies\n[15,16,17,18,19]. RpA increases by approximately a factor 2 when going from\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV down to sNN = 19.4 GeV at pt \u2248 4.6 GeV/c. This is not\nunexpected since due to the steeper spectral shape at lower energies RpA is\nmore sensitive to pt broadening effects. According to the data from Serpukhov\n\u221a\nat sNN = 11.5 GeV [15], RpA increases towards lower energies even more\nrapidly, making interpolations very difficult.\n\n3\n\nNuclear modification factors in A+A\n\nFigure 2 displays the nuclear modification factor RAA for pions based on central A+A data measured by WA98, NA45, NA49 [5,20,9].

RCP\nfor charged pions, charged kaons, and protons measured by NA49 [9]. The dashed\n(dotted) curves are calculations with parton energy loss for pions (kaons) [21].\n\nready suggested in [6]. A new feature in this figure are the recent NA49 data\nthat extend the pt -reach up to 4.5 GeV/c. Bearing in mind all the caveats described in the previous section, the shown RAA values are consistent with the\ntheoretical expectation for an energy loss scenario at realistic gluon densities\nof dNg /dy = 400 \u2212 600 [7]. They are clearly below the RpA values measured\n\u221a\nat slighly higher sNN , which should provide a lower bound on the expected\nRpA at SPS.\nThe problem of the missing p+p baseline measurement can to a certain extent\nbe circumvented by using peripheral A+A collisions as a reference instead.\nFigure 3 shows the RCP for K0s by NA57 (data is also available for h\u2212 , \u039b,\nand \u039b\u0304[10]) and the RCP for pions, kaons, and protons by NA49 [9]. A comparison of the data to calculations including parton energy loss [21,22] shows\nthat the measured RCP values are in line with a quenching scenario. When\nconsidering all systematic errors introduced by different methods of centrality\ndetermination and the estimation of hNcoll i, the results of NA49, NA57, and\nWA98 are found to be consistent with each other. The energy dependence\nof RCP at intermediate pt , which is summarized in the left panel of Fig. 4,\n\u221a\n\u221a\napparantly is strongest between sNN = 17.3 GeV and sNN = 62 GeV. An\ninteresting question is whether this is just a reflection of a similar energy dependence of the Cronin effect or due to a dramatic increase of the parton\n\u221a\nenergy loss. Data on p(d)+A at sNN = 62 GeV would be needed to provide\nan answer. As already visible in Fig. 3, there is a clear mass dependence of\nRCP : RCP (p,\u039b) > RCP (K) \u2265 RCP (\u03c0). This effect is quite similar at SPS and\nRHIC (see right panel of Fig. 4), even though the overall scale is naturally\nlower at higher energies. However, the same mass dependence is present in\n4\n\n\fRCP(p \u2248 3 GeV/c)\n\nNA49 \u03c0 \u00b1 (0-5%)/(34-80%)\n-\n\nNA57 h (0-5%)/(40-55%)\nWA98 \u03c0 0 (0-11%)/(41-57%)\n\n2\n\n-\n\nPHENIX h , \u03c0 0, \u03c0 \u00b1 (0-10%)/(60-92%)\nSTAR h\u00b1, \u03c0 \u00b1 (0-5%)/(40-60%)\n-\n\nt\n\nPHOBOS h (0-6%)/(45-50%)\n\nt\n\nRCP (p \u2248 3 GeV/c)\n\n2.5\n\nBRAHMS h\u00b1 (0-10%)/(40-60%)\n\n1.5\n\np(d)+A \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1, \u03c0 0\n\n3\n\n\u03c00 \u03c0 \u00b1\n\nK\u00b1 Ks\n0\n\n\u039b\n\np\n\nNA49 (0-5%)/(34-80%)\nNA57 (0-5%)/(40-55%)\nWA98 (0-11%)/(41-57%)\n\np+W\ns = 19.4GeV\n\nPHENIX (0-10%)/(60-92%)\nSTAR (0-5%)/(60-80%)\n\n2\n\n1\n1\n-\n\n\u00b1\n\nh, h\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c0 0, \u03c0 \u00b1\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nMass (GeV/c2)\n\ns (GeV)\n\nFig. 4.

Right: The dependence of RCP on\n\u221a\nthe particle mass for SPS ( sNN = 17.3 GeV, filled symbols) [5,9,10] and RHIC\n\u221a\n( sNN = 200 GeV, open symbols) [30,31]. The dark grey band represents RpA from\n\u221a\np+W data at sNN = 19.4 GeV [16], while the hatched band displays the same\nvalues scaled by 0.5.\n\n\u221a\nRpA at sNN = 19.4 GeV. Scaled down by a factor 0.5 it nicely matches the\n\u221a\ndata for A+A at sNN = 17.3 GeV, while the corresponding factor is 0.2 at\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV.\n\n4\n\nHigh pt correlations\n\nFigure 5 shows the two particle correlation functions C(\u2206\u03c6), as well as the\nconditional yields of the jet associated hadrons measurend by NA45 [11] at\n\u221a\nsNN = 17.3 GeV. The method and the choice of the pt -ranges (2.5 GeV/c <\ntrigger\npt\n< 4.0 GeV/c and 1.0 GeV/c < passoc.\n< 2.5 GeV/c) are identical to an\nt\n\u221a\nanalysis performed by the PHENIX collaboration at sNN = 200 GeV [34].\nThe away side structure observed at SPS is clearly broader than a p+p like dijet expectation, as e.g. predicted by PYTHIA, and the width does not depend\nsignificantly on centrality. However, an indication for a modification of its\nshape with centrality is observed: The away-side structure seems to develop\na flat top for central events. Even though this modification of the shape is\nmuch stronger at RHIC, this observations are qualitatively similar at both\nenergies and might in both case be indicative for partonic interaction with the\nproduced medium.\n5\n\n\fC( \u2206\u03c6)\n\nPreliminary\n\n1.02\n\n1\n\n0.98\n\n0.98\n\n0.98\n\nPreliminary\n\n0.1\n\nPreliminary\n\n0\n0\n\n1/N\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n2.5\n3\n\u2206\u03c6 (radians)\n\n0.1\n\nPreliminary\n\nPreliminary\n\ntrig\n\n0.1\n\ndN AB/d( \u2206\u03c6)\n\n1\n\ndN AB/d( \u2206\u03c6)\n\n1\n\n1/N\n\n1/N\n\n1.02\n\ntrig\n\nC( \u2206\u03c6)\n\nPreliminary\n\ntrig\n\ndN AB/d( \u2206\u03c6)\n\n1.02\n\n\u03c3/ \u03c3geom : 10.0 - 20.0 %\nC( \u2206\u03c6)\n\n\u03c3/ \u03c3geom : 5.0 - 10.0 %\n\n\u03c3 / \u03c3 geom : 0.0 - 5.0 %\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n2.5\n3\n\u2206\u03c6 (radians)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n2.5\n3\n\u2206\u03c6 (radians)\n\n\u221a\nFig. 5.

The upper panels of Fig. 6 show the p/\u03c0 + , p\u0304/\u03c0 \u2212 ,\nand \u039b/K0s ratios as measured by NA49, together with the corresponding re\u221a\nsults from STAR [33] and PHENIX [34] at sNN = 200 GeV. Generally, the\nhigher net-baryon density at SPS energies manifests itself in the differences\nin the overall scale of the ratios. What is remarkable though is the fact that\nshape of the pt -dependence is identical to the one observed at RHIC. The\nlower panels of Fig. 6 show the double ratios which do not exhibit a significant pt -dependence. A similar observation has been made in the double ratios\nof RCP by the NA57 collaboration [35]. This would indicate that a possible\ntransition from a hydrodynamical hadronization picture to quark coalescence\nwould happen in the same pt -region at SPS and RHIC.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nNew data on high pt hadron production at the CERN SPS were reviewed.

The baryon/meson ratios as measured by NA49 at sNN = 17.3 GeV [32],\n\u221a\ncompared to results from RHIC at sNN = 200 GeV [33,34]. Please note the different\nscales of the plots.\n\nfrom the lack of reliable p+p and p+A baseline measurements in the relevant\npt -range. This is particularly important here, since the spectral shape changes\ndrastically with energy in the SPS region. Nevertheless, the general picture\nthat emerges from the new data by NA45, NA49, and NA57, as well as from a\nreassessment of older data (WA98, NA45), is that also at SPS parton energy\nloss may be present. The RCP values show no sign of Cronin enhancement\nbut rather indicate that the Cronin effect is counterbalanced by jet quenching. Also, two-particle azimuthal correlations exhibit a qualitatively similar\nbehaviour at SPS than at RHIC and might indicate a partonic interaction\nwith the medium. The new SPS data on intermediate pt baryon/meson ratios\nmight help to understand the underlying hadronization mechanisms.\nThe author would like to thank the organisers of Hard Probes 2006 for the\ninvitation to the conference.
