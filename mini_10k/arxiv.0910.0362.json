While the field of quantum information processing is still open for new ideas, solid\u2013state\nbased realizations, such as semiconductor quantum\u2013dot\nsystems and Josephson\u2013junction based quantum gates,\nhave emerged as major candidates. Appealing features\nare the high levels of technological abilities regarding design and fabrication of these systems, as well as their\nscalability into large arrays.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 Current drawbacks are isolation problems of solid\u2013state quantum systems from their environment on time\u2013scales where external control can be administered, the complexity of controlled fabrication of these artificially grown structures,\nas well as the generation and precise application of sufficiently strong control fields. Since quantum interference, generally, is a frail effect on a mesoscopic length\nscale, it stands to reason to apply optimal control theory to maximize ones ability to steer nanostructures in\nquantum\u2013coherent fashion. In this article we shall review recent progress in this direction, focusing on recent\nprogress within our group.\nOptimal control theory (OCT) generally concerns itself\nwith algorithms for finding control fields which minimize\nor maximize a given performance index, often called cost\nfunctional. As such, OCT represents an example for an\ninverse problem. The fundamental prerequisite to formulate and apply OCT is the ability to express the control objective, as a quantitative mathematical criterion,\ni.e., in form of a cost functional. Typical is also the\npresence of additional constraints. In fact, there is an\nenormous number of problems for which the latter can\nbe formulated in form of differential equations. Probably the most famous example in physics is provided by\nclassical mechanics, however, this type of problem can be\nfound throughout quantitative science.\nThe basic mathematical description for an optimal\ncontrol problem can be given as follows.10 Suppose we\nhave a set M and a functional J(v), with v \u2208 M. M corresponds to the space of solutions and v is an arbitrary particular solution to the problem. The functional J maps M\nonto the set of Real numbers, i.e., J : M \u2192 R, and characterizes the quality of v so that if solution v1 is better than\nv2 , then J(v1 ) < J(v2 ). The best, and therefore called\noptimal solution is defined as v \u2217 = arg minv\u2208M J(v). The\npair (M, J) is a mathematical model of our control problem. Much of this work deals with proper modeling of\ndynamical processes. Here, the cost functional J usually\ndepends on a set of state variables, whose dynamics is\ngoverned by (integro\u2013) differential equations. By proper\ntuning of the controls it is possible to alter the evolution\nof these state variables and to find an extremum of the\ncost functional.\nOCT has its origins in the calculus of variations, especially in curve minimization problems to which considerable attention has been paid at the end of the 17th\ncentury.11 Since then, there has been an ongoing advancement in the field of optimization which culminated in the\n\nwork of Pontryagin and Bellman in the 1950s. Nowadays\nOCT is used in many different areas including engineering, finance, economics and physics. Below, we shall take\na closer look on the latter, namely optimal control of dissipative or open quantum systems with a particular focus\non quantum information processing (QIP). We start out\nin Sec. I B with a brief review of standard optimal control\ntheory in the presence of constraints in form of differential equations (kinetic equations), associated numerical\napproaches, the dynamics of open quantum systems, and\nmodels for dissipation and decoherence. Sec. II gives\na brief account of quantum subsystems. The main part\nof the paper discusses state\u2013selective optimal control for\nMarkovian and non\u2013Markovian quantum systems in Sec.\nIII, and state\u2013independent optimal control in Sec. IV.\nRelevant physical examples are given in the respective\nchapters. Sec. V gives a summary and an outlook.\n\nB.\n\nThe optimality system\n\nWe confine ourselves to a brief introduction to standard optimization theory for continuous systems. Detailed expositions may be found in the literature.10,12\n\n1.\n\nThe cost functional\n\nWe consider a continuous system and denote its state\nvector by x(t) and the control by \u03b5(t). In general, both,\nstate vector and the control, will be multi\u2013dimensional.\nThe former is an element of a linear vector space. The\nmost general case of dynamics of the state vector x(t)\nwe are considering is described by an integro\u2013differential\nequation,\nd\nx(t) =\ndt\n\nZt\n\ndt0 f (x(t0 ), \u03b5(t0 ), t, t0 ),\n\n(1)\n\nt0\n\nwhich may be nonlinear in x. The integral kernel\nf (x(t0 ), \u03b5(t0 ), t, t0 ) depends on two times: the current\ntime t and a time t0 accounting for the past t0 < t. The\ncost functional can be written as,12,13\nZtf\nJ[x, \u03b5](x0 , t0 , tf ) =\n\ndtL(x(t), \u03b5(t), t) + \u03a6(x(tf ), tf ),\nt0\n\n(2)\nwhere L(x(t), \u03b5(t), t) is often called the running cost or\nthe Lagrangean and \u03a6(x(tf ), tf ) is the terminal cost.\nEq. (2) is referred to as Bolza type, whereas cost functionals containing only the terminal or running penalty\nare called Mayer or Lagrange type, respectively.13,14\nThe choice of the particular form of the cost functional reflects the desired objective to be achieved. If\nwe want to steer our system into a given final state\nxf , the straightforward choice is to set L = 0 and\n\n\f3\n\u03a6(x(tf ), tf ) = \u2212 hx(tf ), xf i, where h., .i denotes a real\u2013\nvalued scalar product defined in the linear state\u2013vector\nspace. Another common choice for the Lagrangean is,\nL(x(t), \u03b5(t), t) = \u2212 hxD (t), x(t)i. Here we want the system's state variable to follow a given desired trajectory\nxD (t). If we set xD (t) = xD = const., the system,\nwhen subjected to the corresponding optimal solution,\napproaches the desired state xD as fast as possible and\ntries to stay in that state, which is often called \"state\ntrapping\".\nThe dependence of the Lagrangean on \u03b5 and \u03b5\u0307 (the latter was not explicitly included above) allows the implementation of additional constraints on the control, such\nas shape, duration rate of change, or intensity. Due to\nphysical considerations it is sometimes reasonable to include a constraint imposed on the control intensities, i.e.\nto choose a Lagrangean of the form L(x(t), \u03b5(t), t) =\n2\nL0 (x(t), t) + \u03b1 |\u03b5(t)| , which penalizes large control field\nintensities, where \u03b1 characterizes the degree of penalty.\nIn fact, such a constraint may be mandatory to render the\noptimization problem well\u2013defined mathematically. (See\nSec. III and Ref. 10). If one desires control fields which\nvanish at t0 and tf it is convenient to use a penalty function which depends on time, i.e., \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1(t) and which\ntakes on large values near initial and final time. The\ntime derivative \u03b5\u0307(t) can be included in the Lagrangean\nto introduce a means for suppressing unphysically rapid\nvariations in the control field in the cost functional explicitly, as well as to preserve an analogy to the formalism\nof classical mechanics in form of a velocity\u2013dependent\nLagrangean.\n\n2.\n\nOptimality conditions\n\nThe optimal control field is defined by,\n\u03b5\u2217 (x0 , t0 , tf ) = arg min {J[x, \u03b5](x0 , t0 , tf )} .\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b5\u2208L2 [t0 ,tf ]\n\nA necessary condition for an optimal point is,\n\u03b4J\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\n= 0,\n\u03b5\u2217\n\nZtf\n\n\u0014\u001c\ndt\n\n\u03b4J\n=\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\n\u001c\n\n\u03b4\u03a6(x(t), tf ) \u03b4x(t)\n,\n\u03b4x(t)\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\n\u03b4L(x, \u03b5, t) \u03b4x\n,\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\n\u001d\n\n\u001d\n\n\u0015\n\u03b4L(x, \u03b5(t), t)\n+\n.\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\n+\nt=tf\n\n(4)\n\nt0\n\nHowever, at least for analytical investigations of the optimality system, Eq. (4) is not very useful because x(t) depends implicitly on \u03b5(t). The variation of x with respect\nto \u03b5, \u03b4x\n\u03b4\u03b5 , may be complicated (nonlocal in time). Most\nformulations of the optimality system which circumvent\nthis problem are based on Lagrangean multipliers. The\nnext subsections will consider the formulation of such an\napproach for Markovian systems. Application to non\u2013\nMarkovian quantum systems will be given in Sec. III B.\n\n3.\n\nMarkovian kinetic equation\n\nIf the Kernel f is local in time, Eq. (1) reduces from\nan integro\u2013differential equation to a differential equation.\nThen, adjoining the system differential equations by the\nuse of Lagrangean multipliers \u03bb(t), often called co\u2013state,\none may formulate a new cost functional,\nJ\u02c6 =\n\nZtf\ndt {L(x, \u03b5, t) + h\u03bb(t), \u1e8b(t) \u2212 f (x, \u03b5, t)i}\nt0\n\n+\u03a6(x(tf ), tf ).\n\n(5)\n\nNow the differential equation constraint has been incorporated. By proper choice of the multipliers \u03bb(t), (see\n\u02c6\nEq. (7)), we can eliminate the dependence of \u03b4\u03b4\u03b5J on \u03b4x\n\u03b4\u03b5 .\nIf we define the Hamiltonian,\nH(x, \u03b5, \u03bb, t) = L(x, \u03b5, t) + h\u03bb, f (x, \u03b5, t)i ,\n\n(6)\n\nand apply the calculus of variations, the necessary conditions for an optimal point can be derived (see Ref. 12),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\n\u2202L\n\u2202\n\u2202H\n= \u2212 \u03bb(t) =\n+\nhf , \u03bbi ,\n(7)\n\u2202x\ndt\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u03bb(tf ) =\n,\n\u2202x t=tf\nd\n\u2202H\n=\nx(t) = f (x, \u03b5, t),\n\u2202\u03bb\ndt \u0012\n\u001c\n\u001d\u0013\n\u2202H\n\u2202L\n\u2202\n= 0=\n+ \u03bb(t), f (x, \u03b5, t)\n.\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202\u03b5\nThese equations take the form of Hamilton's equations of\nmotion of classical mechanics and are referred to as Pontryagin's minimum principle. They are simultaneously\nsatisfied for an optimal trajectory.10,15\nOne of the first applications of OCT to quantum systems has been the theoretical examination of how to control the final state of a diatomic molecule.16 A similar approach based on a variational principle has been used to\nmaximize the probability of a certain pathway in a chemical reaction by using coherent two\u2013photon processes.17\nThe use of Lagrangean multipliers and the similar Krotov method is quite common.18,19 These techniques have\nbeen applied to a broad range of quantum mechanical problems.20,21,22,23,24,25 A comparison between the\nKrotov method and gradient methods can be found in\nRef. 18.\nWhen OCT is applied to quantum mechanics, typical\nexamples for state vectors x(t) are wave wave functionsfunctions |\u03c8(t)i22,26 or density matrices \u03c1(t).24,25,27,28\nIn the quantum computation context, the elements of\nthe unitary time evolution operators U (t) are a common\nchoice for x because initial\u2013state\u2013independent optimization schemes are necessary in order to optimize quantum\ngates.19,20,21,29 Recently, time\u2013evolution superoperator\u2013\nbased formulations have been proposed.30,31,32\n\n\f4\nC.\n\nNumerical aspects\n\nThe variational calculus provides the necessary conditions for an extremum of J in form of gradients which\nmay be used as input to a broad range of numerical\nschemes which search for minima of a function for which\nboth function and gradients are available analytically.33\nHowever, deriving the co\u2013state equations for an open\nquantum system often is a tedious task and one may\nwant to use a solely numerical method to compute the\ngradients. One possibility is to discretize the control field\n\u03b5(t) in time,\nt \u2192 tn = nh, with n \u2208 [0, N ], tf = N h + t0 ,\n\u03b5(t) \u2192 \u03b5n = \u03b5(tn ),\nh ... grid spacing,\nand to compute the gradient of the cost functional directly via finite differences,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4J \u03b4J\n\u03b4J\n\u03b4J\n\u2192\n,\n, ...,\n,\n\u03b4\u03b5\n\u03b4\u03b50 \u03b4\u03b51\n\u03b4\u03b5N\n\u03b4J\nJ (\u03b50 , ..., \u03b5n + \u2206\u03b5n , ...) \u2212 J (\u03b50 , ..., \u03b5n , ...)\n=\n.\n\u03b4\u03b5n\n\u2206\u03b5n\nThe price paid when using finite differences is a significant loss in numerical stability relative to the indirect\nvariational method introducing a co\u2013state and care must\nbe taken in identifying the parameter range over which\nmeaningful results are obtained so that convergence can\nbe reached.25 Usually, the extra effort spent in deriving\nand evaluating co\u2013state equations pays dividends when\nperforming the optimization numerically.\nUsing the gradient \u03b4J\n\u03b4\u03b5 , one can utilize e.g. a conjugate gradient method to search for a minimum of the\ncost functional.33 However, such a method is prone to get\nstuck in local minima and convergence may be slow when\nthe initial guess is poor. Instead one can use global search\nalgorithms, the most prominent being stochastic function minimizers, like genetic and differential evolution\nalgorithms or simulated annealing.21,34,35,36,37,38 These\nmethods have the advantage that no calculation of the\ngradient is needed and that it is more likely to find a\nglobal minimum of the cost functional. On the other\nhand, these algorithms usually need lots of cost functional evaluations which may be computationally expensive.\nFor all numerical implementations the control scheme\nhas to be executed on a time grid. The upper limit in grid\nsize is usually determined by the numerical requirements\nposed by the differential equations for state and co\u2013state.\nIn principle one may discretize the control using the same\ngrid.38 This quickly leads to a control field vector of high\ndimension and an according number of field gradients\nwhich makes computation time\u2013consuming. Frequently\nit is advantageous when physical intuition or experimental limitations narrow down the solution space. In particular, parameterising the control has been shown to\n\nprovide significant speedup and reduction in numerical\ncomplexity.\n\nII. APPLICATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL\nTHEORY TO QUANTUM INFORMATION\nPROCESSING\nA.\n\nIntroduction to quantum information processing\n\nIn 1982 Feynman published a paper in which he discusses the question of whether it is possible to simulate\nquantum mechanics effectively using a classical (probabilistic) computer.39 \"Effective\" here means that the\ncomputational resources, (i.e., computation time and\nmemory) scale polynomially, as opposed to exponentially,\nwith the size of the physical system to be simulated. He\nalso introduced the concept of a quantum computer as\na universal quantum simulator which uses \"quantum elements\" in order to simulate another quantum system.\nFor a quantum computer, such a \"quantum element\" is\nthe quantum bit or qubit, which can be seen as the quantum mechanical analogue to the classical bit. The difference with respect to the classical bit, which is either in\nthe state 0 or 1, is that a qubit can be in a superposition\nstate . If we denote the computational basis states of\nthe quantum two level system by |0i and |1i, the pure\n2\n2\nstate c0 |0i + c1 |1i, with ci \u2208 C and |c0 | + |c1 | = 1, is\nalso a valid qubit state. Another difference arises if we\nexamine n\u2013partite systems, e.g. a two\u2013partite system.\nFor a classical 2\u2013bit system it is always possible to assign\na definite state to each of it is components whereas for\na two\u2013qubit system this is not always possible. If two\nqubits are entangled, e.g. if they are in the pure state\n\u221a1 ( |00i + |11i), only the composite system is in a defi2\nnite state.\nIn addition to pure states, a quantum system can also\nbe in a mixed state represented by a density operator \u03c1.40\nTo visualize the state of a single qubit one often uses the\nso called Bloch sphere and Bloch vector. Any qubit state\n\u03c1, pure or mixed, can be written as,\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n~ * ~\u03c3 ),\n(1 + R\n2\n\n(8)\n\n~ = (x, y, z) is the real Bloch vector, |R|\n~ \u2264 1,\nwhere R\nand ~\u03c3 is the spin\u2013vector, containing the Pauli\u2013matrices\n\u03c3i , i = x, y, z. By rewriting the pure state of a qubit,\n|\u03c8i = c0 |0i + c1 |1i into |\u03c8i = sin \u03b82 |0i + ei\u03c6 cos \u03b82 |1i,\nwe may use the angles \u03b8, \u03c6 to represent |\u03c8i by a vector\n(the Bloch vector), with length 1 for pure states, which\npoints to a specific point on the surface of a unit sphere\n(the Bloch sphere), see Fig. 1.\nWithin the circuit model of quantum computing, every\nquantum algorithm can be decomposed into elementary\noperations which correspond to unitary transformations\non the qubits, see Fig. 2.41,42 In analogy to classical computing one can identify universal quantum gates. It has\n\n\f5\n\nz\n\n|1\u00f1\n\nB.\n1.\n\nq\nf\n\nDynamics of quantum systems\n\nUnitary and non\u2013unitary time\u2013evolution\n\nWhen a quantum system is perfectly isolated from its\nenvironment the dynamics is governed by the unitary\ntime\u2013evolution operator, U (t) \u2261 U (t, 0),\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2 i Zt\n\uf8fd\nU (t) = T exp \u2212\nH(t0 )dt0 ,\n(9)\n\uf8f3 ~\n\uf8fe\n\ny\n\nx\n\n0\n\n|0\u00f1\n\nwith the system Hamiltonian,\nH(t) = H0 + Hc (t),\n\nFIG. 1: Bloch sphere and Bloch vector.\n\n(10)\n\nwhere H0 denotes the Hamiltonian of the intrinsic quantum system and Hc the control part. The wave function\nevolves accordingly,\nbeen shown that one\u2013qubit operations together with the\nso called controlled NOT (CNOT) gate, which is a operation on two qubits, is universal for quantum computing.43 However, the particular choice of the CNOT gate\nis not mandatory. It has been proven that almost every\ngate that operates on two or more qubits represents an\nuniversal gate.44\n\nOutput: M bits, xM\n\nNAND\n\nAND\n\nInput: |y\nin\u00f1\n\ntime\n\nU1\nU1\n\nOutput: |y\nout\u00f1\n\nxM = f(xN)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nOR\n\nInput: N bits, xN\n\ntime\n\n|y\n= U|y\nout\u00f1\nin\u00f1\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Decomposition of a classical algorithm into elementary gates.

Universal gates: e.g. one qubit\noperations, U1 , together with the controlled NOT (CNOT).\n\n|\u03c8(t)i = U (t) |\u03c8(0)i .\n\n(11)\n\nThe basic equation of motion for an isolated quantum\nsystem in a mixed state \u03c1 is the von Neumann equation,40\ni\nd\n\u03c1(t) = \u2212 [H(t), \u03c1(t)] .\ndt\n~\n\n(12)\n\nIf we are dealing with open quantum systems, e.g.,\na system S which is in contact with an environment\nB, the resulting time\u2013evolution for subsystem S is non\u2013\nunitary in general. This means a description based upon\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger or von Neumann equation is no longer\nappropriate for S. In order to compute the dynamics of open quantum systems one can use a stochastic\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.45 However, the general approach\nto deal with the non\u2013unitary time evolution of a subsystem is to start from a suitably enlarged composite\nquantum system which obeys the von Neumann equation Eq. (12), followed by a reduction to the degrees of\nfreedom of the subsystem. The form of the composite\nsystem (system S and bath B) Hamiltonian is,\nH(t) = HS (t) \u2297 11B + 11S \u2297 HB + HSB ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere HS , HB and HSB denote the Hamiltonians of system, environment and the interaction between system\nand environment, respectively. By tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom in Eq. (12), one can deduce\nthe differential equation for the density matrix of subsystem S,\nd\ni\n\u03c1S (t) = \u2212 trB {[H(t), \u03c1(t)]} .\ndt\n~\n\n(14)\n\nCalculation of the dynamics of the reduced system is,\nexcept for very few simple examples, a demanding task.\nDespite its simple appearance, it is, in fact, often difficult to cast the above equation in a form in which\nnumerical evaluation is tractable. For Markovian processes one may employ the Lindblad master equation\n\n\f6\napproach which will be described in the next section.\nTo obtain kinetic equations within microscopic quantum\nmechanical models one can use a perturbative expansion\nin the system\u2013environment coupling, non\u2013perturbative\nresummation techniques, or projection operator techniques. For a detailed description of common methods\nsee Ref. 46.\nState superposition and entanglement are key\u2013\ningredients for quantum information processing. Making\nthe qubit to perform a specific unitary transformation\nis done by proper tuning of external controls interacting\nwith the dynamics of the quantum system. However, via\nthe same channels by which one couples to the qubit, as\nwell as by additional sources (\"the environment\") over\nwhich one has no direct control, noise can enter the system. These unwanted perturbations, in general, lead to\ndecoherence (destruction of state\u2013superposition and entanglement) and/or dissipation (i.e., state relaxation),\nboth being detrimental for quantum computation, see\nFig. 3.\n|1\u00f1\n?\n|0\u00f1\n|1\u00f1\n\n|1\u00f1\n\nT1\n\nenvironment\n|1\u00f1\n\n|0\u00f1\n\n|0\u00f1\n\nthe dimensionless operators L\u03bc contained in the dissipator describe the different decay and decoherence channels\nof the quantum system which are opened by its interaction with the environment. The quantities \u03b3\u03bc are effective relaxation rates which may be set phenomenologically or be computed on basis of a microscopic model.\nSince the Lindblad structure is the most general of a\nMarkovian master equation for \u03c1S , it serves as reference for Markovian master equations which are derived\nfrom microscopic models within approximations. Optimal control schemes have been used to optimize the\ndynamics of quantum systems which are described by a\nLindblad equation.25,28,32,47,48 The use of Lindblad operators with constant \u03b3\u03bc 's is phenomenological and lacks\ndetails about the quantum mechanical interaction between sub\u2013system and environment. Therefore, controllability of the system is usually poor when this model is\nappropriate.\nAmong the elementary microscopical models for a\nsystem\u2013bath interaction the most prominent example is\nprobably the spin\u2013boson model.49,50 . In its basic form,\na spin 21 \u2013particle couples linearly to the oscillator bath\npolarization. The Hamiltonian for bath and system\u2013bath\ninteraction, respectively, are usually written as,\nX\nHB =\n~\u03c9k b\u2020k bk ,\nk\n\n|0\u00f1\n\n|1\u00f1\n\nqubit\n\n|1\u00f1\n\nHSB = \u015c \u2297 \u0393, \u0393 = ~\n\nT2\n\nX\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ngk bk + b\u2020k ,\n\n(17)\n\nk\n|0\u00f1\n\n(\u2020)\n\n|0\u00f1\n\n|0\u00f1\n+\n|1\u00f1\n?\n|0\u00f1\n\u00e1\n0|+|1\u00f1\n\u00e1\n1|\n\nFIG. 3: Relaxation and dephasing (i.e., decoherence) due to\nunwanted environmental interactions within the Bloch sphere\npicture.

It can be viewed as a Markovian extension of the von Neumann equation to open quantum\nsystems by adding a dissipator to the equation. In its\ngeneral form,46\ni~\u03c1 \u0307S = [HS (t), \u03c1S ] + D[\u03c1S ],\n\n\u03c1S (0) = \u03c10 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith\nD[\u03c1S ] = i~\n\n2\nNX\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\u03b3\u03bc L\u03bc \u03c1S L\u2020\u03bc \u2212\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n\u0013\n1 \u2020\n1\n\u2020\nL L\u03bc \u03c1S \u2212 \u03c1S L\u03bc L\u03bc ,\n2 \u03bc\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere bk is the bosonic (creation) annihilation operator for mode \u03c9k and gk is the effective coupling strength\nof the kth mode to the spin \u015c \u2208 {Sx , Sy , Sz }. \u0393 denotes the bath polarization. In QIP one focuses mainly\non the case of weak coupling of the bath to the two level\nsystem (interpreted as the qubit). For this case perturbative methods, such as the Born approximation and the\nBloch\u2013Redfield approach, are best suited to describe the\nreduced dynamics of the system.46,51 If one is interested\nin the strong coupling regime, techniques like the polaron\ntransformation52 or path\u2013integral approaches [e.g. the\nnon\u2013interacting blip approximation (NIBA)] are available. For a method which deals with both regimes see\nRef. 53. In general, the validity of each of the mentioned\napproximation schemes also depends on the bath temperature and/or on other bath\u2013spectral\u2013density specific\ncharacteristics (e.g. the cutoff frequency).53,54,55 Optimal control of a qubit system subjected to a polaron\ntransformation and a subsequent approximation by a second order expansion in the tunneling parameter \u2206 [which\nis equivalent to the NIBA approximation, see Ref. 56]\nhas been performed in Refs. 24,38. For longitudinal couplings, i.e., S = Sz , and HS \u221d Sz analytical solutions\nare available.52,57 Because control within HS is restricted\nwithin these cases due to lack of control with respect to\northogonal directions, they are of minor importance for\nQIP applications.\nAnother microscopic model which has been employed\n\n\f7\n(a) State\u2013selective transformation\n\nto take into account the effects of an environment is the\nspin bath. For a review see Ref. 58. In Ref. 21, optimal\ncontrol techniques have been applied in order to obtain\nhigh\u2013fidelity one\u2013 and two\u2013qubit gates in the presence of\ncoupling to \"environmental\" two level systems, which can\nbe interpreted as spin\u2013 21 particles. The Hamiltonian for\nm qubits and N spin\u2013 12 particles is of Heisenberg form,\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c9i Sz,i \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nm\nX\n\n\u03bci C(t)Sx,i +\n\ni=1\n\nN\n\u22121 X\nN\nX\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03b3ij Si * Sj ,\n\ni=1 j>i\n\n(18)\nwhere {Si = (Sx,i , Sy,i , Sz,i )} denotes the (pseudo) spin\u2013\noperator and \u03c9i the (pseudo) Zeeman splitting for particle i. Here it is assumed that it is possible to locally\napply a control field C(t) via coupling to dipole moments\n\u03bci . The strength of the Heisenberg exchange interaction\nbetween the spins is given by \u03b3ij .\n\n(b) State\u2013independent transformation\n\n\u21d2\nC.\n\nState\u2013selective versus state\u2013independent\noptimal control\n\nWhen we apply OCT to QIP systems, we often have\nto change our focus from optimization of state\u2013to\u2013state\ntransitions (e.g. |\u03c8i i \u2192 |\u03c8f i) to an optimization of\nquantum dynamical mappings, see Fig. 4. This means\nthat for quantum computation it is not sufficient to find\na control field which manages to steer a quantum system starting from a particular initial state to a predetermined final state. This form of control is usually\ntermed \"state\u2013dependent\". A quantum gate has to perform the corresponding desired transformation O regardless of the initial state. In fact, the initial state often is unknown. This form of optimization is usually\ntermed \"state\u2013independent\". If we are dealing with unitary time evolution, described by a Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nd\ndt |\u03c8(t)i = \u2212i/~HS (t) |\u03c8(t)i, state\u2013independent optimization is conveniently implemented by optimizing the\ntime propagator US (t), with U\u0307S (t) = \u2212i/~HS (t)US (t)\nand US (0) = 11. Essentially, one minimizes a cost func2\ntional of the form J = ||US (tf ) \u2212 O|| or similar.19,20\nThe task of state\u2013independent optimization is especially interesting for noisy quantum gates. In general,\na superoperator X (t) defines the time evolution of the\nsystem for the interval [0, t], i.e.,\n\u03c1S (t) = X (t)\u03c1S (0),\n\nX (0) = 1,\n\nX\n\n\u2020\nKmn (t)\u03c1S (0)Kmn\n(t),\n\nm,n\n\nKmn (t) = (hn| \u03c1B (0) |ni)\n\n1/2\n\nhm| U (t) |ni ,\n\nwhere U (t) denotes the unitary time\u2013evolution operator\nof the composite system. \u03c1B denotes the density operator of the bath. { |ni} is a complete set of bath modes\nso that hn| \u03c1B (0) |n0 i = \u03b4n,n0 hn| \u03c1B (0) |n0 i. Given a microscopic model, it is, in general, not possible to find\nanalytic expressions for the Kraus operators in terms of\nthe Hamiltonian of the composite system. In fact, even\nan exact numerical treatment may be intractable. However, one can find equations of motion for the superoperator, which can be approximated. One possibility is to\nswitch to a Liouville space description.59 Optimal control\nschemes which are based upon such a description can be\nfound in Ref. 9 and Ref. 60.\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03c1S (t) denotes the subsystem's density matrix at\ntime t. The most general form of such an admissible superoperator is given in terms of Kraus operators\nKmn (t),41\n\u03c1S (t) =\n\nFIG. 4: (a) \"State\u2013selective\" corresponds to a transformation of a predetermined initial state (denoted by a red Bloch\nvector) to a particular given final state (blue Bloch vector).\n(b) \"State\u2013independent\" means that we want to perform a\ndesired mapping, irrespective of the initial state of our qubit.\nFor unitary operations, as common in the QIP context, this\ncorresponds to a rigid rotation of the Bloch sphere.\n\n(20)\n\nIII.\n\nSTATE\u2013SELECTIVE OPTIMAL CONTROL\nOF OPEN QUANTUM SYSTEMS\n\nEarly applications of optimal control to quantum systems have been formulated mostly for state\u2013dependent\ncost functionals for closed quantum systems based on\npure states within the time\u2013dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, with applications mostly in quantum chemistry.61,62\nThen, mixed\u2013state optimal control, formulated within\n\n\f8\nthe von Neumann equation and, finally, within optimum control for open quantum systems has followed.\nState\u2013dependent optimal control has applications in\nmany aspects of quantum physics. Originally, it was\nmotivated for driving a quantum systems, such as a\nmolecule, from an initial state, usually the ground\nstate, into a certain final state, for example, a particular fragmented state of the molecule. Later, combination with coherent control, exploiting quantum interference, has been proposed and executed in semiconductor\nnanostructures.63,64,65,66,67,68,69\nIn this section, we review several cases for state\u2013\ndependent optimal control. Rather than specifying particular physical realizations, we keep the presentation\ngeneral and distinguish between Markovian and non\u2013\nMarkovian quantum systems, i.e., the nature of their\ndissipator. The motivation for this study is the use of\nquantum interference between competing interactions as\na principle of operation for electronic and electro\u2013optic\nnanoscale devices. Particularly in a solid\u2013state environment, electronics\u2013 and spin\u2013based quantum interference\neffects are difficult to establish and to maintain.46 One\nof the potential solutions is to steer the quantum systems along a suitable quantum trajectory so that one\neliminates or minimizes the system\u2013environment interaction by destructive quantum interference. This naturally leads to an optimization problem (inverse problem)\nwhere one seeks optimal control fields which stabilize coherence of a quantum system or maximize induced quantum interference effects.\nFor the remainder of the paper we shall denote the\nquantum subsystem \"system\" and the reduced subsystem\ndensity operator \u03c1S by \u03c1, and US (t) by U (t), for brevity.\nFurthermore, the subsystem Hamiltonian Eq. (10) will\ngenerally be denoted by H(t), except when stated otherwise.\n\nA.\n\nMarkovian kinetic equations\n\nThe Lindblad equation Eq. (16) captures the dynamics of a quantum system in the Markovian regime, i.e., on\na time\u2013scale of the quantum system which is large compared to the memory\u2013loss time of the environment.46 On\nthis time\u2013scale, the damage to coherent dynamics of a\nquantum system caused by its environment partially has\nbecome irreparable, however, limited reduction of coherence loss has been shown to be possible, particularly, if\nthe effective rates \u03b3\u03bc in Eq. (16) feature a dependence\nupon the adjustable control fields. We shall first consider\nthe situation of constant \u03b3\u03bc 's. In this case, the optimal\ncontrol problem of a dissipative qubit may be solved analytically by direct inversion, as is shown in the following\nsubsection. In the second part of this section we briefly\ndiscuss the case of control\u2013field dependent effective rates\n\u03b3\u03bc which allow for greater control potential.\n\n1.\n\nDirect inversion\n\nFor direct inversion of the Lindblad equation one first\nselects a physically allowed trajectory \u03c1(t) which is compatible with a specified initial and final state \u03c1(0) and\n\u03c1(tf ), from which a suitable Hamiltonian H(t) is extracted,28,70,71,72\nH(t)\n\n\u03c1(0) \u2212\u2192 \u03c1(tf ) \u21d2 H(t).\n\n(21)\n\nThe main problem lies in the existence and identification\nof such a trajectory. The problem is even more complicated in open quantum systems than it is for pure coherent dynamics under unitary time\u2013evolution.73 In this\ncase, there is a trajectory and a solution to the problem\nif the eigenvalues of \u03c1(0) and \u03c1(tf ) are identical. Unfortunately such a simple criterion cannot be formulated\nfor open quantum systems. In fact there are several open\nquestions for open quantum systems : How does one determine or even prove the existence of an allowed trajectory? Which role does the kinetic equation play on the\nexistence? The procedure (21) may lead to non\u2013local\nsolutions for H(t). Hence, the question arises, what conditions have to be met in order to derive experimentally\nfeasible solution to such inversion problems. Finally, if\na solution has been identified, is it unique or are there\nequivalent solutions which may be better suited for physical realization? Obviously, the difficulties in answering\nthese questions increase rapidly with the dimension of\nthe Hilbert space and the complexity of the dissipator.\nNevertheless, some nontrivial and interesting results on\ndissipative two\u2013level systems have been found, where the\nsystem is described by a Lindblad equation. The reader\ncan find a detailed discussion of this topic in Ref. 28.\nHere we give a brief overview to demonstrate possibilities and difficulties associated with the direct inversion\nstrategy using a two\u2013level system.\n\n2.\n\nChoice of the trajectory: decoherence free subspace\n\nIn many OCT problems the decoherence free subspace\n(DFS) plays a central role. Using the kinetic equation\nEq. (15), the latter is defined as the set of states \u03c1DF\nfulfilling,74,75,76\nD[\u03c1DF ] = 0.\n\n(22)\n\nDepending on the nature of the dissipator, Eq. (22) defines a subspace of density operators, which interesting\nfor OCT because within the DFS the system dynamics is completely coherent. In many systems, the DFS\nis constructed by dynamic decoupling processes, such as\nan application of control pulses known as \"bang\u2013bang\"\ncontrol.77,78,79,80 To study such methods, the spin\u2013boson\nmodel again is well suited, since it explicitly displays\nthe influence of the external control on the system\u2013\nenvironment interaction.24 If a state \u03c1DF exists and is\n\n\f9\nknown and if the system allows complete control, the optimal trajectory is given by,\n\u03c1(0) \u2192 \u03c1DF \u2192 \u03c1(tf ),\n\n(23)\n\nwhereby the switching into and out of \u03c1DF has to be executed rapidly. Using inversion formulas one can evaluate\nEq. (23) to obtain an optimal control Hamiltonian. We\nremark that in such cases it is sufficient to consider the\ninversion of the von Neumann equation because one can\nminimize environment\u2013induced dissipation by \"instantaneous\" switching in Eq. (23) in principle.123 Recently we\nhave extended the concept of the DFS from states to evolution superoperators. This strategy can be applied for\nboth state\u2013dependent and state\u2013independent OCT.30\n\ndissipation\u2013less system, Eq. (30) represents conservation\nof purity, i.e., constant length of the Bloch vector. If the\ndissipation is described by fixed rates, this relation is independent of the control, which means that there is no\nHamiltonian which allows independent control of all matrix elements of the density matrix. Eq. (28), Eq. (29)\nand Eq. (30) are the basis for the solution of the inversion problem. One can see that Eq. (30) defines a\ncondition which in simple cases is a differential equation.\nDepending on the dissipator, more complicated integro\u2013\ndifferential equations may occur.\n\n4.\n\nExample\n\nWe consider a simple model, given by the Hamiltonian,\n3.\n\nTwo\u2013level system\n\nH(t) = \u03b5(t)\u03c3x ,\n\nThe kinetic equation for the density matrix \u03c1(t) (quantum trajectory) is given by Eq. (15). Considering the inverse problem, we begin with the selection of a quantum\ntrajectory \u03c1(t) for a specified time interval t \u2208 [0, tf ]. We\nset,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c111 (t)\na(t) + ib(t)\n\u03c1(t) =\n.\n(24)\na(t) \u2212 ib(t) 1 \u2212 \u03c111 (t)\nHere \u03c111 (t), a(t), b(t) are real valued functions. To solve\nthe inversion problem we put the dissipation part on the\nleft\u2013hand side of Eq. (15) and subtract it from \u03c1\u0307(t). In\nparticular we set,\n1\n\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 11 (t) \u2261 \u03c1\u030711 (t) \u2212 (D[\u03c1(t)])11 ,\ni~\n\n(25)\n\n1\n \u0307\n\u00e3(t)\n\u2261 \u0227(t) \u2212 Im(D[\u03c1(t)])12 ,\n~\n\n(26)\n\n1\n \u0307\nb\u0303(t) \u2261 \u1e03(t) + Re(D[\u03c1(t)])12 .\n~\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the control \u03b5(t) is a real\u2013valued function (here Ho\nin Eq. (10) is chosen zero). For the Lindblad operators\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwe choose, L1 = \u03b31 |0ih1|, L2 = \u03b32 |1ih0|. For simplicity we set \u03b31 = \u03b32 \u2261 \u03b3. In this case, there is restricted\ncontrol over the system only, i.e., the Bloch vector can\nbe rotated around the x\u2013axis only (see Fig. 1). We consider the case where we seek to manipulate the population \u03c111 (t). By inversion of the Lindblad equation one\nobtains,\n\u03b5(t) = ~\n\n\u1e03(t) + 4\u03b3b(t)\n.\n\u22121 + 2\u03c111 (t)\n\n(32)\n\nHere b(t) is given by,\n\u0012\nZ tn\n0\n\u22124\u03b3t\nb(t) = e\nb(0)2 +\ne8\u03b3t [1 \u2212 2\u03c111 (t0 )]\u00d7\n0\n\nInsertion of Eq. (24) into Eq. (15) leads to,\n~\u00e3 \u0307 = bu + w(1 \u2212 2\u03c111 ),\n\n(28)\n\n \u0307\n\u2212 ~b\u0303 = au + v(1 \u2212 2\u03c111 ).\n\n(29)\n\nHere we set u \u2261 H11 \u2212 H22 and v \u2261 Re(H12 ), w \u2261\nIm(H12 ) as our unknowns. Note that \u03c111 (t), a(t) and\nb(t) in Eq. (24) depend on each other via the condition,\n\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 11\n \u0307\n \u0307 + b\u0303b\n\u00e3a\n=\n(1 \u2212 2\u03c111 ),\n2\n\n(31)\n\n(30)\n\nwhich follows from Eq. (15) and links the variables \u03c111 (t),\na(t) and b(t). This relation must hold for any allowed\ntrajectory of the dissipative quantum system, independent of the structure of D[\u03c1(t)]. We remark that for a\n\no \u0011 12\n[\u03c1\u030711 (t0 ) + 8\u03b3\u03c111 (t0 ) \u2212 4\u03b3] dt0 ,\n\n(33)\n\nas follows from Eq. (30). We require a real Hamiltonian,\nwhich leads to a(t) = a(0)e\u22124\u03b3t . So one has the choice\nof \u03c111 (t) as only remaining freedom. The other variable\nb(t) and the control \u03b5(t) are deduced quantities. For a\nspecific example, we wish to maintain Rabi oscillations\nin presence of dissipation and set,\n\u03c111 (t) = (1 \u2212 2A) cos2 (\u03a9t) + A,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere A \u2265 0 is a constant. Induction and maintenance\nof Rabi oscillations in a realization of a two\u2013level system\nis generally viewed as a test for its qubit potential.\nThe field for the special case \u03b3 = 0 is,\n\u221a\n2(1 \u2212 2A) sin(2\u03a9t)\n\u03b5(t) = ~\u03a9 p 2\n.\n(35)\n8b0 + (1 \u2212 2A)2 [1 \u2212 cos(4\u03a9t)]\nFor b(0) \u2261 b0 = 0 this expression reduces to a constant\nfield \u03b5 = ~\u03a9. The expression for \u03b3 6= 0 is also available in\nanalytical form, but is a quite lengthy expression. Fig. 5\n\n\f10\nshows a numerical example. Part (a) shows the field for\nEq. (35) (dotted line) and the field with \u03b3 6= 0 (solid\nline). Part (b) shows \u03c111 (t), when the respective fields\nare used to drive the system. As the figure shows, a complete restoration of the prescribed trajectory, Eq. (34), is\npossible. Further inspection of the field shows, however,\nthat this complete restoration is possible only for a limited time; for how long , depends on the parameters A,\nb0 , and the damping constant \u03b3. One can compute this\ntime numerically using Eq. (32).\nDissipative N \u2013level systems have also been modeled\nfully numerically within the Lindblad equation accounting for population and polarization decay, based on constant decay rates.25 The problem addressed was population transfer from a non-degenerate stable ground state\nto an unstable target state at tf , using weak electric\nfields whenever possible. Work concentrated on a ladder\u2013\ntype N \u2013level system for which an electric field can induce\ndipole transitions between adjacent energy levels, as typical for systems with inversion symmetry, and schemes\nas used in stimulated\u2013Raman\u2013adiabatic\u2013passage (STIRAP) experiments. For all systems studied, i.e., two\u2013,\nthree\u2013, and four\u2013level systems, it was found that the\nweak\u2013dissipation limit which is relevant for atomic and\nmany molecular systems, poses no serious threat to success. However, as dissipative effects increase in strength,\nso do the electric fields which are necessary for reaching the selected target state. In addition, their onset is\ndelayed closer and closer to target time. Clearly, with\nincreasing complexity of the system, such as the number\nof unstable levels and decay channels, the degree of success decreases. Since purity decay cannot be controlled\ndirectly by the external control for constant Lindblad\ndecay rates, \"last\u2013minute transfer\" from a stable state\nremains to be the only solution for a complete transfer\ninto an unstable target state when there is no control\nover decay rates.\n\n5.\n\nState\u2013dependent optimization within the spin\u2013boson\nmodel\n\nDissipative two\u2013level systems naturally are treated\nwithin the spin\u2013boson model introduced in Sec. II B 2.\nIn spite of it's simplicity, it allows coverage of a large\nspectrum of physical effects by proper mapping of more\ncomplex quantum systems and appropriate choice for the\nspectral function. Unfortunately analytic solutions are\nnot available, in general. In Ref. 24 the Bloch\u2013Redfield\napproach was used to derive Markovian kinetic equations for the spin\u2013boson model in the strong electron\u2013\nboson coupling limit. Using the polaron transformation, kinetic equations for the Bloch vector with an effective coupling within the spin system are obtained.\nThis coupling is renormalized by the spin\u2013boson interaction and displays a retarded control\u2013field dependence\nwhich arises from interference between the system\u2013bath\nand system\u2013control field interaction. Several physical\n\nsituations of spin flips have been investigated numerically to demonstrate quantum\u2013interference\u2013based optimal control of this model for an open quantum system.\nUsing simple analytical forms for the control fields it was\nshown at the example of this model how external control\nof quantum interference can be used to control the effective system\u2013bath interaction for minimization or maximization of the coherence loss. In the following section,\nwe outline the generalization to non\u2013Markovian kinetic\nequations.\n\nB.\n\nNon\u2013Markovian kinetic equation\n\nThe study of control\u2013field dependent system\u2013bath interactions has recently been extended to a study of optimal control of qubit realizations with non\u2013Markovian\ndynamics which captures and clearly demonstrates the\nrole and potential of quantum interference effects in the\ncontrol of effective system\u2013bath interaction.47,81 The basic idea is that, when the system\u2013bath interaction is either treated theoretically or can be addressed experimentally on a quantum\u2013mechanical level, quantum interference effects can be utilized to control the effective\ncoupling strength.82 Needless to say, this requires microscopic models for open quantum systems, on the theoretical side, and poses considerable challenges for experimentalists regarding precision, strength, and time\u2013scales\nfor the control to be administered.\nIt appears that, until recently, classical and quantum\nmechanics applications of optimal control have concerned\nthemselves with mostly, if not exclusively, Markovian systems, i.e., systems for which knowledge of the state of the\nsystem at any given time is sufficient to uniquely specify\ntheir past and future. However, when one studies the\ndynamics of a subsystem, non\u2013Markovian kinetic equations arise naturally when the degrees of freedom of the\nenvironment are integrated out. This has become of particular importance to the study and control of quantum\nsubsystems (\"realizations of quantum systems\") in the\ncontext of implementation of quantum algorithms into\nreal systems. If one can address and control a system in\nits quantum regime, quantum interference leads to new\npathways (\"control knobs\") for steering the system and\nfor controlling dissipation. Put simply, in the classical\nregime only the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix (in a suitable basis) can be manipulated,\nwhile in the quantum regime all matrix elements are\navailable for manipulation.68 Simple decay rates become\ntime\u2013 and control\u2013dependent greatly enhancing control\nover the system.\nWithin quantum mechanics, the emergence of nonlocality with respect to time is most directly seen within\nthe projection operator method whereby the bath (environment) degrees of freedom are projected out formally\nby a suitable projector Q, such that, in the simplest case\nwhen using the identity representation 1 = P + Q, one\nobtains two coupled sets of kinetic equations of first order\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 5: (a) The control fields versus time. Dashed line: solution in absence of dissipation, given by Eq. (35). Red solid line:\ncontrol field which corrects for dissipation. (b) Trajectory \u03c111 (t) versus time. Dashed line: uncorrected, damped trajectory,\nobtained with the dissipation\u2013less solution. Red, solid line: corrected trajectory as prescribed by Eq. (34). Parameters:\n\u03b3/\u03a9 = 0.0071. A = 0.3, b0 = 0.2.\n\nin time, one each for P \u03c1 and one for Q\u03c1 = (1 \u2212 P )\u03c1. Formally integrating the kinetic equation for Q\u03c1 = (1 \u2212 P )\u03c1\nand inserting the result into the one for P \u03c1, the latter\nbecomes a non\u2013Markovian differential equation for P \u03c1.46\nSimilarly, non\u2013Markovian equations are obtained readily\nwithin the density matrix approach when truncating the\nBBGKY\u2013type hierarchy of higher correlation functions.83\nIn many cases, non\u2013Markovian kinetic equations can be\napproximated or even exactly be replaced by an enlarged\nnumber of Markovian equations.46,84\nWe consider for the quantum subsystem a nonMarkovian time\u2013evolution of the general form,38,85,86\nZ\n\u03c1\u0307(t) =\n\nt\n\ndt0 K(t, t0 ; \u03b5, \u03c1), for \u03c1(0) = \u03c1o .\n\n(36)\n\n0\n\nThe integral kernel K(t, t0 ; \u03b5, \u03c1) is given by the following\nform. It depends on two times: the current time t and a\ntime t0 accounting for the past t0 < t. Furthermore, the\nkernel functionally depends on the control field \u03b5(t00 ), for\nt00 < t such that causality is fulfilled, as well as on \u03c1(t0 ) for\nt0 \u2264 t. In general, it is a non\u2013linear super\u2013operator which\nmaps \u03c1(t0 ), t0 \u2264 t onto a linear operator of trace zero.\nThe latter is needed to ensure trace preservation for \u03c1(t).\nMoreover, the memory kernel K(t, t0 ; \u03b5, \u03c1) must preserve\npositivity of \u03c1(t) at any time 0 \u2264 t \u2264 tf . It is assumed\nthat Eq. (36) is integrable, i.e., there exists at least one\nsolution to any given control field \u03b5(t), t \u2208 [0, tf ] which\nitself is square-integrable and bounded over the interval\n[0, tf ]. In other words, the constraint is holonomic. These\nconditions are equivalent to the assumption of the existence of a Kraus representation for the time\u2013evolution\noperator defined by Eq. (36).124\nIn what follows we shall review and extend a recent generalization of optimal control problems to non\u2013\nMarkovian constraints.85 For didactic reasons we present\nthis approach pointing out analogies to classical mechanics. Referring to Sec. I B we make the following assign-\n\nments. The state vector x is interpreted as the density operator of the subsystem \u03c1(t) and the scalar product hx, yi between two vectors x and y is interpreted\nas the Froboenius product between operators X and Y ,\nTr{X \u2020 Y }.25\nThe objective is formulated by means of a cost functional for which we choose the general form,\nJ(\u03b5, tf ) = Tr {\u03a6o (\u03c1(tf )), \u03c1\u0307(tf )}\nZ tf\n+\nTr {\u03a6(\u03c1(t), \u03b5(t), \u03c1\u0307(t), \u03b5\u0307(t), t)} dt.(37)\n0\n\nThe time derivatives (\"generalized velocities\") \u03c1\u0307(t) and\n\u03b5\u0307(t) are included to preserve the analogy to the formalism\nof classical mechanics, as well as to allow for conditions on\nthe rate of change of the state of the system and a means\nfor suppressing unphysically rapid variations of the control field in the cost functional explicitly. The real\u2013valued\nfunctionals \u03a6o (\u03c1(tf ), \u03c1\u0307(tf )) and \u03a6(\u03c1(t), \u03b5(t), \u03c1\u0307(t), \u03b5\u0307(t), t)\nare bounded from below and continuously differentiable\nwith respect to their arguments. They account for the\nspecific physical objective at target time tf and intermediate times t \u2208 [0, tf ). The target time itself, in general,\nis variable in the optimization process.12 The dependence\nof \u03a6 on \u03b5(t) and \u03b5\u0307(t) allows the implementation of additional constraints on the control, such as shape, duration,\nrate of change, or intensity. This may be essential to arrive at solutions which are experimentally feasible. The\n(indirect) dependence of J on \u03c1\u0307 is included mostly for\nanalogy to classical mechanics. In principle, specification\nof the rate of change of \u03c1 may be useful. For example,\nstate trapping can be treated by implementation of the\ncondition \u03c1\u0307(t) = 0, t \u2208 [0, tf ]. However, for a quantum\nsubsystem the state of the system is fully determined by\n\u03c1 and its kinetic equation is of first order in time. In\ncontrast, for classical mechanics the state of the system\nis specified by generalized coordinates and velocities and\nthe kinetic equations for the coordinates are of second\n\n\f12\norder in time. Hence, simultaneous specification of \u03c1 and\n\u03c1\u0307 may over\u2013determine the system of equations.\nAn optimum control field is one which minimizes the\ncost functional under the constraint that \u03c1(t) obeys the\nkinetic equation. Thus the control field \u03b5(t) represents\nindependent variables and the density matrix elements\n\n(\u0014\n\nplay the role of dependent variables. In the following we\nwill formulate the necessary conditions using an indirect\nmethod which provides the gradient of the cost functional\nwith respect to control field and target time.\nThe total differential of the cost functional is given by,\n\n)\n\u03b4\u03a6\nd\u03c1\u0307(tf ) +\nd\u03b5(tf )\ndJ(\u03b5, tf ) = Tr\n\u03b4 \u03b5\u0307 tf\ntf\ntf\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03b4\u03a6\n\u03b4\u03a6o\n\u03b4\u03a6\n\u03b4\u03a6\ndtf \u2212\nd\u03b5(0)\n+ Tr\n+ \u03a6(\u03c1, \u03b5, \u03c1\u0307, \u03b5\u0307, t) \u2212\n\u03c1\u0307 \u2212\n\u03b5\u0307\n\u03b4t\n\u03b4 \u03c1\u0307\n\u03b4 \u03b5\u0307\n\u03b4 \u03b5\u0307 0\ntf\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0015\n\u0013 \u0015\nZ tf\nd \u03b4\u03a6\n\u03b4\u03a6\nd \u03b4\u03a6\n\u03b4\u03a6\n\u03b4\u03c1(t) \u2212\n\u03b4\u03c1(t) +\n\u2212\n\u03b4\u03b5(t) .\n+\ndtTr\n\u03b4\u03c1 t\ndt \u03b4 \u03c1\u0307 t\n\u03b4\u03b5 t\ndt \u03b4 \u03b5\u0307 t\n0\n\u03b4\u03a6o\n\u03b4\u03a6\n+\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4 \u03c1\u0307\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03b4\u03a6o\nd\u03c1(tf ) +\n\u03b4 \u03c1\u0307\n\nHere the variation \u03b4\u03c1(t) is dependent upon the variation\nof \u03b5(t0 ), for t0 < t via the kinetic equation Eq. (36). \u03b5\u0307 =\nd\u03c1\nd\u03b5\ndt and \u03c1\u0307 = dt .\nSince it is assumed that the constraint is holonomic,\none may use either the general method of Lagrangean\nmultipliers or Hamilton's variation principle to derive\nthe necessary conditions for an extremum of the cost\nfunctional.15 In the first derivation given below, the dependence of \u03c1(t) on \u03b5(t) is incorporated by a Lagrangean\nmultiplier which, in this context, is termed co-state or\nadjoint state. The variation is made with respect to\nthe generalized coordinates \u03c1 and \u03b5 and the associated\nvelocities \u03c1\u0307 and \u03b5\u0307. The second, equivalent formulation\noffered here is based on Hamilton's variational principle which uses both \u03b5(t) and \u03c1(t) and their canonically\nconjugated variables (\"canonical momenta\") as variation\nparameters. In optimization theory, the latter method is\nknown as Pontryagin's minimum principle.87\n\n1.\n\nMinimality conditions via the Lagrangean multiplier\ntechnique\n\nThe Lagrangean multiplier method is a powerful tool\nfor incorporation of general constraints, holonomic or\nnon\u2013holonomic, into an extremum problem.15 In order\nto establish a tractable relation between the variation\nof the control \u03b5(t0 ) and the density operator \u03c1(t) a Lagrangean multiplier \u03bb(t) is introduced to implement the\nkinetic equations into the variation of the cost functional.\nFor each constraint a Lagrangean multiplier is introduced\n\nd\ndt\n\n(38)\n\nand an extended cost functional is constructed,\n\u02c6 tf ) \u2261 J(\u03b5, tf )\nJ\u02c6 = J(\u03b5,\n(39)\n\u0014Z t\n\u0015\nZ tf\n+\ndtTr{\u03bb(t)\ndt0 K(t, t0 ; \u03b5, \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1\u0307(t) }.\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03bb(t) is a linear operator in the Hilbert space of the system\nbut it does not have the properties of a density operator.

This implementation has first been proposed by Loss and DiVincenzo.1 Quantum dots can be\nrealized, for example, by means of surface gates on top\nof a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure which holds a two\ndimensional electron gas. Controlling and monitoring\nthe number of conducting electrons in each dot is possible by means of well\u2013established experimental methods.92 In a system consisting of two neighboring quantum dots, each populated by one excess electron, exchange interaction results in a Heisenberg\u2013like Hamil(12)\n~1 * S\n~2 , if the dots are coupled\ntonian, HS\n= J(t)S\nvia a tunable tunneling barrier.1,2 Two\u2013qubit arrays of\nquantum dots are realized by extending heterostructures\nas described above with additional gate electrodes, thus\ndefining an appropriate electric potential to trap several\nelectrons at different sites.92\nIn this section, we first define the Hamilton operators\nfor the double quantum dot, the environment, and the\ninteractions between spin and bath. To describe the dynamics of electron spins in the double dot, a Markovian\nquantum master equation approach is used.46,51,93\nWe examine two conduction electrons, each sitting in\nits own quantum dot, where each is described by a Hamiltonian of the form,\n(i)\n\ne\ng\u2217\nSz Bz(i) (t) = \u2212 \u03bcB Bz(i) (t)\u03c3z(i)\n2me\n2\n(i)\n(i)\n\u2261 \u2212~B\u0303z (t)\u03c3z , i = 1, 2\n(60)\n~ (i)\n(61)\n= ~\u03c3 .\n2\n\nHS (t) = \u2212g \u2217\n\n~ (i)\nS\n\nFIG. 15: Control of the inhomogeneous part of the kinetic\nequations Eq.

The function g(t)\nprovides a vanishing control field for t = 0, as well as\nsmooth increase of \u03b5(t) for t > 0. As optimization procedure we choose a constrained, parallelized differential\nevolution algorithm with 230 individuals and 2000 generations.99 The results are given in Fig. 16 and Tab. I.\nThe desired final entangled state |\u03c8 + i can be realized with high accuracy (J [\u03b5\u2217 ] \u2248 10\u22127 ). As can be\nseen in Fig. 16(d), the differential evolution algorithm\nconverges to a control field with large negative constant\nvalue (J \u2248 \u22121 meV), which corresponds to the maximal allowed magnitude of the Heisenberg qubit\u2013qubit\ncoupling for the present double\u2013quantum\u2013dot system.\nQubit\u2013qubit couplings of several 100 \u03bc eV have been reported in Ref. 92. A large negative value of J(t) makes\nthe desired entangled state |\u03c8 + i to the approximate non\u2013\ndegenerate ground\u2013state of the system. States with an\naccumulated\nphase \u0001with respect to |\u03c8 + i, i.e.,\n\u221a relative i\u03c6\n|\u03c8i = 1/ 2 |10i + e |01i , become energetically well\nseparated from |\u03c8 + i and, hence, transitions to these are\nsuppressed. From a different point of view, decoherence\nhelps to relax the system from |\u03c8I i into the new ground\nstate. The stronger the environmental coupling the faster\nthe system is able to relax.

Among these, one selects the one which can\nmost easily be realized in experiment, for example, re-\n\ngarding intensity and temporal behavior. Ideal quantum\ngates should be perfectly shielded from the environment\nyet, upon demand, couple strongly to the control. This\nclearly constitutes contradicting requirements which can\nbe alleviated by a compromise developed within an optimal control scheme.\n\nIV.\n\nSTATE-INDEPENDENT OPTIMAL\nCONTROL\n\nAs outlined in the introductory part of this review, state\u2013independent optimal control plays an important tool for the identification of the most efficient quantum gate realizations. Indeed, the control\nof quantum subsystems using external forces is the basis for many recent experiments on Bose condensates,\nqubits and quantum gates, molecules, and nanostructures.63,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109 For most applications seeking the observation or utilization of quantum\ninterference effects, a minimization of the interaction between the quantum system and its environment is required. For most efficient cooling of a quantum system,\nhowever, maximizing the latter is desirable.110 In this\nsection, we shall briefly review three new approaches to\nstate\u2013independent optimal control for open quantum systems and applications to physical qubit and quantum\ngate implementations.\n\n\f20\nA.\n\nidentification of optimized control fields consists of three\ncontributions,\n\nPerturbative approach\n\nHere we discuss a general approach for state\u2013\nindependent optimal control for weakly dissipative quantum systems. The task posed is the execution of a unitary operation O within the dissipative quantum system\nas perfectly as possible in spite of the presence of an environment and independent of the (unknown) initial state\nof the system.\nThis approach differs from earlier work in several major and nontrivial aspects: The cost functional for state\u2013\nindependent optimized control of inherently dissipative\nquantum systems avoids the need for repeated solution of\nthe kinetic equation of the quantum subsystem's density\noperator during the optimization process and the need\nfor a co\u2013state altogether, in contrast to mainstream optimal control for quantum systems discussed in previous\nchapters which is based on cost functionals constrained\nby the system's kinetic equations.10,12 .\nLet us consider the general kinetic equation Eq. (15)\nfor the density operator \u03c1(t) of a quantum subsystem\nwith a contribution from the time evolution under the\nHamiltonian H(t) containing the external control fields\nand the dissipator D[\u03c1]. The latter may be quite general\nbut is assumed to be small in the sense of time\u2013dependent\nperturbation theory. In particular, it may be of Markovian (Lindblad) or non-Markovian form, see Eqs. (16)\nand (36).24,38,86,111 The objective is to find an optimal\ncontrol to realize a specified unitary operation O which\nis to be executed within a prescribed time interval [0, tf ].\nThe basic idea here is to seek a control which minimizes\nthe effect of the dissipator while, at the same time, executing O as perfectly as possible. In order to motivate\nthe cost functional selected below, Eq. (15) is written in\nthe interaction picture,\n\u03c1\u0303(t) = U \u2020 (t)\u03c1(t)U (t),\nwhere U (t) is the time\u2013evolution operator for H(t).\nEq. (15) takes the form,\ni~\u03c1\u0303 \u0307 = U \u2020 (t)D[U (t)\u03c1\u0303(t)U \u2020 (t)]U (t),\n\n(73)\n\nand describes the action of the dissipator for given control Hamiltonian and initial state. In the absence of the\ndissipator, \u03c1\u0303(t) = \u03c1(0) and the time\u2013evolution is perfectly unitary. Confining ourselves to the case of weak\ndissipation Eq. (73) is solved iteratively. Replacing, on\nthe r.h.s. of Eq. (73), \u03c1\u0303(t0 ) by \u03c1(0) gives the solution\nwithin first\u2013order perturbation theory,\nZ\n1 t \u2020 0\n\u03c1\u0303(t) \u2212 \u03c10 \u2248\nU (t )D[U (t0 )\u03c1(0)U \u2020 (t0 )]U (t0 )dt0 .\ni~ 0\n(74)\nThe optimization approach uses two different cost\nfunctionals: an auxiliary cost functional J to determine\nthe optimal solution, and a second one, JZ , is used to\ntest the quality of the solution for a set of Z randomly\nselected initial states. The auxiliary cost functional J for\n\nJ = JO + JD + J\u03b5 .\n\n(75)\n\nThe contribution JO enforces completion of the desired\noperation O (up to a phase) at time tf . Possible choices\nare,21\nJO = N 2 \u2212 |Tr{O\u2020 U (tf , 0)}|2 ,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere N is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the\nquantum system,\n2\n\n0\nJO\n= Tr{O\u2020 U (tf , 0) \u2212 11} ,\n\n(77)\n\n\u00012\n\u00012\nRe Tr{O\u2020 U (tf , 0) \u2212 11} .\nIm Tr{O\u2020 U (tf , 0)} , or\nThe second contribution, JD , seeks to minimize the\nundesirable action of the dissipator at final time tf and\nis written,\nJD = sD hhTr[(\u03c1\u0303(tf ) \u2212 \u03c1(0))2 ]ii,\n\n(78)\n\nwhere Tr and hh...ii, respectively, denote the trace and\nan average over all (pure or mixed) possible initial states.\nsD is a real\u2013valued weight factor to guide convergence.\nThe distribution of initial states is chosen according to\nthe specific physical system.\nThe third contribution controls shape and intensity of\nthe control,\nZ tf\n2\nJ\u03b5 =\ns(t) |\u03b5(t)| dt,\n(79)\n0\n\nwhere \u03b5(t) is the vector containing the external control\nfields. s(t) is a weight factor, as used before. Note that\nthis cost functional J avoids the use of the dependent\nvariable \u03c1(t), thus avoiding a co\u2013state. The control may,\nin general, enter J\u03b5 in the propagator U (t, 0) and the\ndissipator explicitly. Therefore, there is no need to evaluate the full kinetic equation Eq. (15). Evaluation of\nJ during the optimization process requires calculation\nof U (t, 0), t \u2208 (0, tf ]. This is done best by solving the\nSchroedinger equation for H(t) as an initial value problem with U (0, 0) = 11, or by using a discretized version of\nthe formal time\u2013ordered solution Eq. (9).\nAn arbitrary minimization algorithm can be employed.\nFor algorithms requiring cost functional and gradients as\nan input, variations of J with respect to the control \u03b5(t)\ncan be computed directly by using,\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\u2206t \u03b4H(tk )\n\u03b4U (t, 0)\n= lim U (t, tk+1 ) \u2212\nU (tk\u22121 , 0).\nM \u2192\u221e\n\u03b4\u03b5(tk )\n~ \u03b4\u03b5(tk )\n(80)\nThis works also for Hamiltonians in which the field enters nonlinearly, as long as its dependence remains local\nin time. For complicated dissipators with retarded dependence upon the control fields this provides a significant reduction in computational effort.47 For microscopic\nmodels of dissipation, the computation of the retarded\n\n\f21\ndissipation kernel is by far the most time\u2013consuming part\nin the optimization loop. It should also be emphasized\nthat the present approach, apart from being designed for\nweak dissipation in a perturbative sense, per se does not\nprovide a novel physical mechanism for optimization nor\ndoes it introduce a bias regarding the selected optimization solutions. As will be shown in the simple examples\nbelow, there is a multitude of practically equivalent solutions whose selection is mainly determined by the initial\nguess and the form of J\u03b5 . By the nature of the problem, all these optimal solutions are also good solutions\nfor vanishing dissipator.\nVerification of the quality of a solution is performed\nby computation of a test functional JZ which is averaged\nover a set of Z initial states \u03c1j ,\nJZ =\n\nZ\n1 X\nTr[(\u03c1j (tf ) \u2212 O\u03c1j O\u2020 )2 ].\nZ j=1\n\n(81)\n\nThe initial states \u03c1j are distributed randomly according\nto their likelihood of occurrence, consistent with the state\naverage in JD . \u03c1j (tf ) are the density operators obtained\nfrom the kinetic equation Eq. (15) using the optimized\ncontrol fields. Note that merely this performance test\nrequires repeated evaluation of the full kinetic equations.\nMoreover, it does not resort to a perturbative account of\ndissipation.\nThis approach was originally applied to a dissipative\nqubit, with basis states | 0i and | 1i, treated within the\nLindblad equation.48 Numerical examples will be published elsewhere.48 A general result, however, should be\nmentioned here also. We find that for the weak dissipation limit and where (local) optimal minima exist, there\nis a large number of equivalent solutions. This is similar to the case of unitary systems.112 As a consequence\nthere is considerable freedom regarding the shape of the\ncontrol fields which thus can be used to aid experimental\nimplementation.\nThis approach has recently been applied to a study\nof the upper limit for the fidelity of single\u2013qubit gate fidelities within currently available technology for Josephson charge qubit realizations. Josephson\u2013junction\u2013based\nqubits, such as flux and charge qubits, have become systems of significant attention due to their potential for\nscalable qubit and quantum gate realizations.3,4,5,6,7,8,9\nTypical for qubit realizations they suffer from two shortcomings: they are quantum two\u2013level systems merely\nwithin approximation and their dynamics is influenced,\napart from the externally applied control, by an undesirable coupling to the environment. This leads to state\nleakage from the two\u2013dimensional computational Hilbert\nspace of the ideal qubit, as well as undesirable decoherence.29 Both effects need to be suppressed before scaling\nto larger numbers of qubits becomes meaningful. Tackled\nwith the perturbative approach outlined above, among\nthe infinitely many equivalent control fields which execute the operation for the ideal qubit exactly one has to\nselect and optimize these which minimize state leakage\n\nand dissipation.\nIn a Josephson charge qubit, (see Fig. 17), the qubit\nis encoded in the number of additional Cooper pairs on\na superconducting island (none |0i and one |1i).3\nreservoir\n\nJosephson junction\n\nf\n0\n\na... superconducting\ntop electrode\n\n0\n\nEJ ,CJ\n\nEJ ,CJ\n\nb... superconducting\nbottom electrode\n\n--\n\n--\n\nisland\n\nCg\n\nb\n\nc\n\na\n\nVg\n\nc... tunnel oxyde\nlayer\n\nFIG. 17: A superconducting ring is divided by an oxide layer\n(c) into a superconducting reservoir and an island.

For a detailed description see Ref. 3\n\nThe two control fields ultimately consist of a gate voltage Vg which determines the equilibrium charge state\nof the island and a magnetic flux \u03c6 which controls the\nJosephson energy.

EC denotes the single electron charging energy of the island and EJ = EJ (\u03c6) is the\nJosephson coupling energy, which depends on the exterCg Vg\n, with Cg denally applied magnetic flux \u03c6; ng = 2e\nnoting the gate capacitance. It is believed that the dominant dephasing mechanism is due to background charge\nfluctuations in the vicinity of the gate electrodes.113,114\nTwo Lindblad operators i = x, z capturing dephasing\nand population decay were identified as,\np\nLi = \u03b3i (t)Hi ,\nwith,\n2\n\u03b3i (t) \u2261 2\n~\n\nZ\n0\n\nt\n\ndt0 ci (t, t0 ),\n\n\f22\nHere L(t) is the usual Liouville\u2013superoperator, whereas\nD(t) represents the dissipator.

Thus, fluctuations\nin the gate voltage (\u221d Lz ) lead to dephasing and fluctuations in the magnetic flux and/or Ej0 (\u221d Lx ) lead to\ncombined population decay and dephasing. The former\ntypically occur on a significantly shorter time\u2013scale than\nthe latter.\nIn addition to the optimization scheme outlined above,\nthe superoperator\u2013based scheme introduced in the following chapter was used to optimize Hadamard gate operation. This study has revealed that leakage from the\ncomputational subspace can be largely suppressed, but\ndissipative effects, predominantly due to dephasing due\nto fluctuations in the charging energy, lead to noticeable\nreduction in fidelity below 100 percent. While the latter\nis readily achievable in the sole presence of state leakage,\nfor switching times of about 0.5 ns and typical system\nparameters taken from experiment, the predicted optimal fidelity is about 98 percent in presence of both state\nleakage and dephasing. Effects from fluctuations in the\nJosephson energy are found to be negligible. These results are in qualitative agreement with a superoperator\noptimization scheme based on a spin\u2013boson model for\nnoise in the leaky qubit.31\n\nB.\n\nEq.

The Liouville\u2013superoperator L(t) depends on the time\u2013dependent system Hamiltonian H(t).\nThe elements are given by,\nLijmn (t) = Him (t)\u03b4nj \u2212 Hnj (t)\u03b4im .\n\nFor a dissipator in Lindblad form, DL , we have the expression,\nL\nDijmn\n= i~\n\nXn\n(L\u03bc )im (L\u2020\u03bc )nj\n\u03bc\n\no\n1\n1\n\u2212 (L\u2020\u03bc L\u03bc )im \u03b4jn \u2212 (L\u2020\u03bc L\u03bc )nj \u03b4im .

As a consequence the initial state is detached from the time evolution. We give an overview of the theory, using a simple\nexample, where dissipation is described by a Lindblad\ndissipator. A more elaborate discussion is given in Ref.30\nwhere we consider a microscopic dissipator based on the\nspin\u2013boson model and various control Hamiltonians.\n\nKinetic equations\n\nWe start with the kinetic equation for the reduced density matrix of the open quantum system, \u03c1(t), Eq. (15).\nThe Hamiltonian of the system, H(t), contains the unperturbed system Hamiltonian H0 and the external control\nHc (t), see Eq. (10). At this point the dissipator D[\u03c1]\ncan be quite general.19,24,28,38,61,115,116,117,118 We rewrite\nEq. (15) using superoperators,\ni~\u03c1\u0307(t) = [L(t) + D(t)]\u03c1(t).\n\n(85)\n\nHere L\u03bc are Lindblad\u2013operators, describing the structure\nof the dissipator. For completeness we give also Eq. (83)\nin components,\n\nSuperoperator formulation of\nstate\u2013independent control\n\n1.\n\n(84)\n\n(83)\n\n(87)\n\nFor the evolution superoperator X (t) we have the equations,\nL\ni~\u1e8aijrs (t) = [Lijmn (t) + Dijmn\n]Xmnrs (t),\n\n(88)\n\nwith Xijrs (0) = \u03b4ir \u03b4js and the state\u2013evolution of an initial state \u03c1(0) is given by,\n\u03c1ij (t) = Xijrs (t)\u03c1rs (0).\n\n(89)\n\nWhen we compare Eq. (87) with Eq. (88) we can see that\nthe only, but in practice relevant difference of both is the\nnumber of differential equations. In Eq. (87) this number\ngrows as N 2 , whereas in Eq. (88) it grows as N 4 ,where\nN is the dimension of the Hilbert space. This makes\nthe OCT problem for state independent control including dissipation numerically more expensive.\nL\nFor dissipation\u2013less systems, Dijmn\n\u2261 0 in Eq. (88),\none can express the evolution superoperator components\nXijrs (t), using the usual time\u2013evolution operator U (t),\n\u2020\nXijrs (t) = Uir (t)Usj\n(t).\n\n(90)\n\n\f23\n3.\n\nCost functional\n\nWe formulate in this section the cost functional and\nthe optimization problem. Let O the target operation,\nunique defined up to a physical irrelevant global phase.\nWe consider first the transformation of a state, represented by a initial density operator \u03c1(0). In the ideal\ncase the final state is,\n\u03c1(tf ) = O\u03c1(0)O\u2020 ,\n\n(91)\n\nfor any \u03c1(0). Considering a pure coherent dynamic we\nobtain the target superoperator XT ,\n\u2020\n\u2020\nXijrs (tf ) = Uir (tf )Usj\n(tf ) \u2192 Oir Osj\n= (XT )ijrs .

(10), which enters in Eq. (88), defines the task of\nstate independent optimal control of dissipative quantum\nsystems. One can solve this mathematical problem using\ndifferent methods.12 We remark that Eq. (93) applied to\na dissipation\u2013less system takes the form Eq. (76).\n4.\n\n6.\n\nWe consider a simplified model for a Josephson two\u2013\nqubit system and apply the theory presented before to\nthe CNOT gate.41,119 The example is chosen in order to\ndemonstrate the strategy. To describe the system we use\nthe product states of the computational basis, |0i|0i \u2261\n|1i, |0i|1i \u2261 |2i, |1i|0i \u2261 |3i, |1i|1i \u2261 |4i.

To proceed, we need to specify the Lindblad\noperators L\u03bc . As we consider two identical qubits, which\nwithout coupling, H 12 (t) = 0, should evolve independently, the Lindblad operators must have a tensor product structure. For each qubit we use two Lindblad operators to describe transitions between the two basis states\n|0i and |1i. In particular we set for the four Lindblad\noperators,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(97)\nL1 = \u03b31 |0ih1| \u2297 1 = \u03b31 (|1ih3| + |2ih4|),\nL2 =\nL3 =\nL4 =\n\nAn example: The CNOT gate\n\n5.\n\nWe note that this structure of the qubit\u2013qubit interaction\nrecently was studied for dissipation\u2013less systems, where\na minimization of a cost functional of the type Eq.

The con(i)\ntrol fields are \u03b5x,z (t). For the qubit\u2013qubit interaction\n12\nH (t) we set (with C a constant),\n12\n\nH (t) =\n\nC\u03b51x (t)\u03b52x (t)\u03c3y\n\n\u2297 \u03c3y .\n\nT2 =\n\n\u03b31 (|1ih2| + |3ih4|),\n\n(99)\n\n\u03b32 (|2ih1| + |4ih3|).\n\n(100)\n\n2\n,\n\u03b31 + \u03b32\n\nT1 =\n\n1\n.\n\u03b31 + \u03b32\n\n(101)\n\nIn our model the unbiased single qubit, \u03b5x (t) = 0, relaxes\nto the equilibrium state,\n!\n\u03b31\n0\n(1)\n\u03b31 +\u03b32\n\u03c1eq =\n.\n(102)\n\u03b32\n0\n\u03b31 +\u03b32\nWe note that only for \u03b31 = 0 or \u03b32 = 0 this is a pure\nstate, in general hoverer, Eq. (102) describes a mixed\nstate. The equilibrium state of the two\u2013qubit\u2013system is\n(1)\n(2)\nthe product state, \u03c1eq = \u03c1eq \u2297 \u03c1eq .\n7.\n\nNumerical study\n\nIn order to obtain further results we have to compute\nthe kinetic equation Eq. (88) numerically. We assume\ngiven rates \u03b31,2 . To solve the optimization problem, we\nset up the fields by a Fourier series,\n\u03b5(t) =\n\n(96)\n\n(98)\n\nFor simplicity we use the same rates \u03b31,2 for both qubits.\nDephasing and relaxation in the one\u2013qubit system occurs\nduring the times,\n\nJosephson charge qubits are optimal controllable quantum systems. Control of the wave function can be achieve\nby tuning gate voltages and magnetic fluxes.3 The single\nqubit Hamiltonians (i = 1, 2),\n(i)\nH (i) (t) = \u03b5(i)\nx (t)\u03c3x + \u03b5z (t)\u03c3z .\n\n\u03b32 (|3ih1| + |4ih2|),\n\nF\nX\nk=1\n\nak sin(\u03c9k t) ,\n\n\u03c9k =\n\nk\u03c0\n.\ntf\n\n(103)\n\n\f24\nAll four control fields are expressed by such a decomposition, with a priori unknown coefficients. Whit this\nAnsatz we have for F \u2192 \u221e a complete function system\nand we have incorporated also boundary conditions, in\nour example, \u03b5(0) = \u03b5(tf ) = 0. When the coefficients are\nknown, we can compute the evolution superoperator using the kinetic equation, Eq. (88) and the cost functional\nEq. (93). We start with a set of guess coefficients and\nminimize Eq. (93) using standard line search routines.\nWe set F = 8 coefficients for each control field. Decay rates are chosen as \u03b31 tf = \u03b32 tf = 0.1, the constant\nC = tf /~. The cost functional is in the unitary case of\nthe order J \u2248 10\u22127 and with dissipation is J = 0.1678.\nResults are shown in Fig. 18. The optimal control fields\nare plotted in (a) and (b). The lower part of the figure\nshows the absolute values of the superoperator elements.\nThe bars in (c) represent the ideal values and in (d) we\nplot the values obtained by using the fields shown in (a)\nand (b). The norm of \u03c7 decreases from k\u03c7(0)k2 = 16 to\nk\u03c7(tf )k2 = 13.15. In order to demonstrate the action of\nthe dissipator we choose very strong decay rates. After\none gate operation the norm of \u03c7 lose about 20% of its\ninitial value.\n\nC.\n\nOptimal control within the Kraus operator\nrepresentation\n\nRecently, a theoretical study of the Josephson charge\nqubit was performed to identify its performance limits within current experimental means.31 It accounts for\nstate leakage, dissipation and decoherence and is based\non a Kraus representation of the time\u2013evolution superoperator, see Sec. II C. The Hilbert space of the system is\ndivided into the computational subspace C over which the\ndesired quantum operation is defined, and the remaining\nspace L is spanned by potential \"leakage\" states. The full\nHilbert space (without environment) is the direct sum,\nC \u2295 L.\nState\u2013independent optimization is performed as follows. One considers a map, \u03c1(0) 7\u2192 \u03c1(t) = Et {\u03c1(0)},\nfor which the superoperator Et is functionally dependent\nupon the control field \u03b5(t), i.e., Et = Et [\u03b5]. Since positivity of the density operator \u03c1(t) must be conserved,\nthe map E has to be completely positive and thus can be\nrepresented by Kraus operators Km ,41,120\nX\n\u2020\n\u03c1(t) =\nKm [\u03b5](t)\u03c1(0)Km\n[\u03b5](t).\n(104)\nm\n\nThe optimal control field \u03b5\u2217 (t) is selected such that, at\nsome final time tf , Etf [\u03b5\u2217 ] approaches the desired mapping E O as closely as possible. For given quantum gate\noperations,\nE O {.} = O (.) O\u2020 ,\n\n(105)\n\nwhere O denotes the desired unitary operation. For\nquantum information theory it is useful to formulate\n\nthe cost functional within the language of process tomography (see e.g. Refs. 121,122). The mapping E\ncan be expressed\nby expanding the Kraus operators,\nP\nKm (t) =\nn \u03b1mn K\u0303n , with \u03b1mn \u2208 C and K\u0303n \u2208 A,\nwhere A denotes a complete basis set of M \u00d7 M matrices.121 M = MC + ML , where MC and ML correspond\nto the number of (orthonormal) computational and leakage basis states, respectively. The state of the quantum system at tf and starting out in \u03c1(0) now reads,\nP\n\u2020\n\u03c1(tf ) = Etf {\u03c1(0)} =\nm,n K\u0303m \u03c1(0)K\u0303n \u03c7mn (tf ), with\nP\n\u2217\n\u03c7mn =\nk \u03b1km \u03b1kn . For evaluation of the process tomography matrix \u03c7, one chooses a fixed set of operators\n{\u03c3j } = B (for simplicity we choose B = A) and determine\nthe time\u2013evolution of these operators\nP with respect to the\nmapping E, \u03c3j (tf ) \u2261 Etf {\u03c3j } = k cjk \u03c3k . Eq. (104) is\na linear mapping and one can obtain \u03c7 by computing the\ntime evolution of the set B to fully characterize the quantum operation performed. However, calculating the time\nevolution using Eq. (104) is often intractable. Hence, one\nmay want to approximate the dynamics of the system by\nemploying e.g. perturbative methods. A short description of appropriate techniques for the spin\u2013boson model\nis given in Sec.

In its beginning\nit dealt with state\u2013dependent control of unitary systems\nwithin the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Nowadays, one deals\nwith open quantum systems obeying more or less complex master equations to study dissipative effects in quantum systems, such as quantum gate realizations or Bose\ncondensates.\nIn this article we have presented recent progress in optimal control theory applied to the dynamics of open dissipative quantum systems. While we have exclusively\npresented our own results, we have tried to reference relevant work and alternative approaches which are available\nin the literature. Special focus was given to approaches\nwhich allow external control of the effective system\u2013bath\ninteraction. The motivation for investigating this aspect\nin particular lies in the recognition that most effective\n\n\f25\n\nFIG. 18: CNOT gate: (a), (b) shows the control fields of both qubits respectively in units of ~/tf . In (c) are shown the 16 \u00d7 16\nelements of the target superoperator, which must be compared to the result of numerical optimization (d).\n\ncontrol of the system\u2013bath interaction has to be administered at the quantum level, i.e., on a time scale for\nwhich the system\u2013bath interaction reveals its quantum\nnature.\nThe presented work covers two main tasks: statedependent control and state\u2013independent control. The\nfirst task is important when one wishes to prepare a\nquantum system in a specific state, starting from a predetermined initial state, usually its ground state. For\nthis case, we reviewed standard optimal control theory\nand an extension to non\u2013Markovian systems. The latter\napproach has been applied to a model system to demonstrate quantum interference effects in the control of the\neffective system\u2013bath interaction (dissipation). Furthermore, we reviewed analytic solutions for dissipative two\u2013\nlevel systems which solve the optimization problem by\ndirect inversion. As an example, optimal control fields\nfor inducing Rabi oscillations in a dissipative two\u2013level\nsystem have been derived. While direct inversion is limited to simple models, it allows the derivation of absolute\nbounds for controllability. In general, numerical methods provide local minima only. This holds particularly\nfor conjugate\u2013gradient methods. Global minima can be\nfound, in principle, by evolutionary algorithms, however,\nat the expense of a large number of evaluations of the\ncost functional.\nThree recently developed approaches to state\u2013\nindependent optimal control were presented. A first\u2013\norder perturbative approach of the system\u2013bath interaction was formulated which determines optimal con-\n\ntrol fields using an auxiliary cost functional consisting\nof three parts which, respectively, enforce execution of\nthe quantum operation, minimization (maximization) of\nthe system\u2013bath interaction, and the desired shape of\nthe control. Application to SQUID\u2013based qubit realization was reviewed. A completely general approach based\non the time\u2013superoperator representation was presented.\nIt provides the most general possible representation of\nstate\u2013independent optimal control for open quantum systems. A third related approach based on the Kraus operator representation of the time\u2013evolution superoperator and a formulation of the cost functional within process tomography we specially developed for application\nto quantum\u2013information processing.\nAn attempt was made to render the presentation\nwidely applicable throughout quantum physics. Our\nphysical examples, however, were restricted to solid\u2013state\nrealizations, in particular quantum dots and SQUIDS.\nThe need for a microscopic description to fully exploit\nthe potential of control of quantum systems naturally\nleads to numerical complexity limiting such models to elementary quantum systems at present. Moreover, quantum information processing will require studies regarding scaling behavior of dissipative effects with quantum\ngate array size. It is therefore important to reduce complicated many\u2013body systems to simple effective models,\nwhenever possible. Several such models were reviewed:\nthe Lindblad equation, the spin\u2013boson model and the\nspin\u2013bath model.\nWhile this article has discussed optimal control from\n\n\f26\na theoretical point of view, it can also be executed in\nconjunction with experiment. For example, using feedback control, optimal control fields can be determined\nin a learning cycle. Pulse shaping in ultra\u2013fast laser\nspectroscopy is a representative example for this strategy. Clearly, interplay between theory and experiment\nwill be beneficial and is inevitable for modeling experimental setups.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nElectronic address: robert.roloff@uni-graz.at\nElectronic address: markus.wenin@uni-graz.at\nElectronic address: walter.poetz@uni-graz.at\nD.
