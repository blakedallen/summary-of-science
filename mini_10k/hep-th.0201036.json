't Hooft, L. Susskind,\nJ. Maldacena, et al.), quantum gravity and string theory on certain manifolds with\nboundary can be studied in terms of a conformal field theory on the boundary. Only\na few mathematically exact results corroborating this exciting program are known.\nIn this paper we interpret from this perspective several constructions which arose\ninitially in the arithmetic geometry of algebraic curves. We show that the relation\nbetween hyperbolic geometry and Arakelov geometry at arithmetic infinity involves\nexactly the same geometric data as the Euclidean AdS3 holography of black holes.\nMoreover, in the case of Euclidean AdS2 holography, we present some results on\nbulk/boundary correspondence where the boundary is a non\u2013commutative space.\n\u00a70. Introduction\n0.1. Holography principle. Consider a manifold M d+1 (\"bulk space\") with\nboundary N d . The holography principle postulates the existence of strong ties\nbetween certain field theories on M and N respectively. For example, in the actively\ndiscussed Maldacena's conjecture ([Mal], [Wi]), M d+1 is the anti de Sitter space\nAdSd+1 (or AdSd+1 \u00d7 S d+1 ), N d its conformal boundary. On the boundary one\nconsiders the large N limit of a conformally invariant theory in d dimensions, and\non the bulk space supergravity and string theory (cf. e.g. [AhGuMOO], [Mal],\n[Suss], ['tH], [Wi], [WiY]).\nThe holography principle was originally suggested by 't Hooft in order to reconcile unitarity with gravitational collapse. In this case M is a black hole and N is the\nevent horizon. Thus the bulk space should be imagined as (a part of) space\u2013time.\nThere are other models where the boundary can play the role of space\u2013time\n(Plato's cave picture), with the bulk space involving an extra dimension (e. g. the\nrenormalization group scale) and a Kaluza\u2013Klein type reduction [AlGo], and \"brane\nworld scenarios\" where one models our universe as a brane in higher dimensional\nspace\u2013time, with gravity confined to the brane.\nIn this paper we consider first of all a class of Euclidean AdS3 bulk spaces\nwhich are quotients of the real hyperbolic 3\u2013space H3 by a Schottky group. The\nboundary (at infinity) of such a space is a compact oriented surface with conformal\nstructure, which is the same as a compact complex algebraic curve. Such spaces\nare analytic continuations of known (generally rotating) Lorentzian signature black\n1\n\n\f2\n\nhole solutions, and they were recently studied from this perspective by K. Krasnov\n(cf. [Kr1]\u2013[Kr4].)\n0.2. Arithmetic geometry at infinity. Consider a projective algebraic curve\nX defined, say, over the field of rational numbers Q. It can be given by equations\nwith integer coefficients which defines a scheme XZ , \"arithmetical surface\". X itself\nis the generic fiber of the projection XZ \u2192 Spec Z. Finite points of the \"arithmetic\ncurve\" Spec Z are primes p, and the closed fibers of XZ at finite distance are the\nreductions XZ mod p. One can also consider infinitesimal neighborhoods of p and\nthe respective fibers which are simply reductions of XZ modulo powers pn . The\nlimit of such reductions as n \u2192 \u221e can be thought of as a p\u2013adic completion of XZ .\n\nA geometric analog of this picture is an algebraic surface fibered over an affine\nline (replacing Spec Z.) We can complete the affine line to the projective one by\nadding a point at infinity, and extend the fibered surface by adding a closed fiber at\ninfinity. If we want to imitate this in the arithmetic case, we should add somehow\n\"the arithmetic infinity\" to Spec Z and enhance the geometry of X by appropriate\nstructures.\n\nIt was long known that the arithmetic infinity itself is represented by the embedding Q \u2192 C and considering the complex absolute value on an equal footing\nwith p\u2013adic valuations. In his paper [Ar] S. Arakelov demonstrated that Hermitian\ngeometry of XC constitutes an analog of p\u2013adic completions of XZ . In particular,\nGreen's functions for appropriate metrics provide intersection indices of arithmetic\ncurves at the infinite fiber. Arakelov's arithmetic geometry was since then tremendously developed and generalized to arbitrary dimensions.\nOne aspect of p\u2013adic geometry was, however, missing in Arakelov's theory of\narithmetical infinity: namely, an analog of the closed fiber XZ mod p and the related\npicture of reductions modulo powers of p approximating the p\u2013adic limit.\nIn Manin's paper [Man2] it was suggested that this missing structure can be\nmodeled by choosing a Schottky uniformization of X(C) and treating this Riemann\nsurface as the conformal boundary of the respective handlebody obtained by factoring out H3 with respect to the Schottky group. Comparing this structure with the\np\u2013adic case, one should keep in mind that only curves with maximally degenerate\nreduction (all components of genus zero) admit a p\u2013adic Schottky uniformization\n(Mumford's theory). Thus we imagine \"the reduction modulo arithmetic infinity\"\nto be maximally degenerate: a viewpoint which is supported by other evidence as\nwell.\nWe see thus that the \u221e\u2013adic geometry at arithmetic infinity, developed in\n[Man2], involves exactly the same geometric data bulk space/boundary as the Euclidean AdS3 holography of black holes. Moreover, Arakelov's intersection indices\nare built from Green's functions, which form the basic building blocks for Polyakov\n\n\f3\n\nmeasures as well as the correlation functions of bosonic and fermionic field theories\non X (see [ABMNV], [Man1], [Fay], [FeSo].)\nIn the first section of this paper we demonstrate that the expressions for these\nGreen functions in terms of the geodesic configurations in the handlebody given in\n[Man2] can be nicely interpreted in the spirit of the holography principle.\nA recent attempt to generalize [Man2] to higher dimensions is due to A. Werner\n([We]). It would be interesting to discuss her construction as a case of holography.\n0.3. Modular curves and non\u2013commutative boundary. The second section is dedicated to the holography in 1+1 dimensions which we recognize in the\napproach to the theory of modular curves developed, in particular, in [ManMar]. In\nthis case H3 is replaced by the upper complex half\u2013plane H2 , and a Schottky group\nby a subgroup G of the modular group. The most interesting new feature is that\nthe boundary of the quotient space considered in [ManMar] is a non\u2013commutative\nspace: it is the quotient G\\P1 (R) treated as a crossed product in the style of\nConnes. This might be of interest, because non\u2013commutative boundaries of moduli spaces (e. g. that of instantons) play an increasingly important role in physics\nconsiderations.\nIn particular, we argue that one reason why little is known on AdS1+1 holography, unlike the much better understood case of AdS2+1 , is that a treatment of\nholography for AdS1+1 and its Euclidean counterpart H2 should take into account\nthe presence of non\u2013commutative geometry at the boundary.\n0.4.

We\nalso thank Kirill Krasnov for several useful and encouraging comments.\n\u00a71. Handlebodies as holograms\nIn this section we review the basic notions of the boundary and bulk geometry\nand function theory in the context of Schottky uniformization. Then we state and\ninterpret the main formulas of [Man2] in the light of the holography principle.\n1.1. Green's functions on Riemann surfaces. Consider\nP a compact non\u2013\nsingular complex Riemann surface X and a divisor A =\nx mx (x) on it with\nsupport |A|. If we choose a positive real\u2013analytic 2\u2013form d\u03bc on X, we can define\nthe Green function g\u03bc,A = gA as a real analytic function on on X \\|A|. It is uniquely\ndetermined by the following conditions.\n(i) Laplace equation:\n\u2202 \u2202 \u0304 gA = \u03c0i (deg(A) d\u03bc \u2212 \u03b4A )\nP\nwhere \u03b4A is the standard \u03b4\u2013current \u03c6 7\u2192 x mx \u03c6(x).\n\n\f4\n\n(ii) Singularities: if z is a local parameter in a neighborhood of x, then gA \u2212\nmx log |z| is locally real analytic.\nR\n(iii) Normalization: X gA d\u03bc = 0.\nP\nLet now B =\ny ny (y) be another divisor, |A| \u2229 |B| = \u2205. Put g\u03bc (A, B) :=\nP\ny ny g\u03bc,A (y). This is a number, symmetric and biadditive in A, B.\n\nGenerally, g\u03bc depends on \u03bc. However, if deg A = deg B = 0, g\u03bc,A,B depends\nonly on A, B. Notice that, as a particular case of the general K\u00e4hler formalism,\nto choose d\u03bc is the same as to choose a real analytic Riemannian metric on X\ncompatible with the complex structure. This means that g\u03bc (A, B) = g(A, B) are\nconformal invariants when both divisors are of degree zero. If moreover A is the\ndivisor of a meromorphic function wA , then\ng(A, B) = log\n\nY\n\ny\u2208|B|\n\n|wA (y)|\n\nny\n\n= Re\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3B\n\ndwA\nwA\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3B is a 1\u2013chain with boundary B. This is directly applicable to divisors of\ndegree zero on the Riemann sphere P1 (C).\nThis formula admits also a generalization to arbitrary A, B of degree zero on a\nRiemann surface of arbitrary genus. The logarithmic differential dwA /wA must be\nreplaced by the differential of the third kind \u03c9A with pure imaginary periods and\nresidues mx at x. Then\nZ\ng(A, B) = Re\n\n\u03c9A .\n\n(1.2)\n\n\u03b3B\n\nIf we drop the degree zero restriction, we can write an explicit formula for the basic\nGreen's function g\u03bc,x (y) via theta functions in the case when \u03bc is the Arakelov\nmetric constructed with the help of an orthonormal basis of the differentials of the\nfirst kind. For a characterization of Arakelov's metric in a physical context, see\n[ABMNV], pp. 520\u2013521.\n1.1.1. Field theories on a Riemann surface X. Green's functions appear\nin explicit formulas for correlators of various field theories, insertion formulas, and\nPolyakov string measure. In [ABMNV] they are used in order to establish the\ncoincidence of certain correlators calculated for fermionic, resp. bosonic fields on\nX (bosonization phenomenon.) See [Fay] for a thorough mathematical treatment.\n1.2. Green's functions and bulk geometry: genus zero case. In this subsection X is the Riemann sphere P1 (C). It is convenient to start with a coordinate\u2013\nfree description of all basic objects.\nChoose a two\u2013dimensional complex vector space V and define X = XV as the\nspace of one\u2013dimensional vector subspaces in V . Define the respective bulk space\n\n\f5\n\nas a three\u2013dimensional real manifold H3 = HV whose points are classes [h] of\nhermitian metrics h on V modulo dilations: h \u223c\n= h\u2032 iff h = \u03c1h\u2032 for some \u03c1 > 0.\nClearly, P GL(V ) acts on HV and XV . The stabilizer of any [h] is isomorphic to\nSU (2). Any point [h] defines a unique K\u00e4hler metric on XV which is stabilized by\nthe same subgroup as [h] and in which the diameter of XV equals one. This metric,\nin turn, determines a volume form d\u03bc = d\u03bc[h] on XV .\nThe bulk space HV has a natural metric: the distance between [h] and [h\u2032 ] is\nthe logarithm of the quotient of volumes of unit balls for h and h\u2032 , if one ball\nis contained in the other and their boundaries touch. In fact, HV becomes the\nhyperbolic three\u2013space of constant curvature \u22121. Its conformal infinity XV can\nbe invariantly described as the space of (classes of) unbounded ends of oriented\ngeodesics.\nWe will now give a bulk space interpretation of two basic Green's functions\ng((a) \u2212 (b), (c) \u2212 (d)) and g\u03bc (z, w), where d\u03bc corresponds to a point u \u2208 HV as\nexplained above. To this end, introduce the following notation from [Man2]. If\na, b \u2208 HV \u222a XV , {a, b} denotes the geodesic joining a to b and oriented in this\ndirection. For a geodesic \u03b3 and a point a, a \u2217 \u03b3 is the point on \u03b3 at which \u03b3 is\nintersected by the geodesic \u03b4 passing through a and orthogonal to \u03b3. In particular,\nthe distance from a to \u03b3 is the distance from a to a \u2217 \u03b3. If two points p, q lie on\nan oriented geodesic \u03b3, we denote by ordist (p, q), or else l\u03b3 (p, q), the respective\noriented distance.\n1.2.1. Lemma. We have\ng((a) \u2212 (b), (c) \u2212 (d)) = \u2212ordist (a \u2217 {c, d}, b \u2217 {c, d}) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\n1/2\n\ng\u03bc (p, q) = log\n\ne\n.\ncosh dist (u, {p, q})\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe following Fig.1 illustrates the configurations of geodesics involved.\n\nx\n\nd\n\nb*{c,d}\na\n\ny\nb\na*{c,d}\n\nu\n\nc\n\nFig. 1\n\n\f6\n\nWe invite the reader to compare these configurations to the Feynman diagrams\nin [Wi] illustrating propagation between boundary and/or interior points.\nTo check, say, (1.3), it is convenient to introduce the standard coordinates (z, y)\nidentifying H with C \u00d7 R+ . Both sides of (1.3) are P GL(V )\u2013invariant. Hence it\nsuffices to consider the case when (a, b, c, d) = (z, 1, 0, \u221e) in P1 (C). Then {c, d} =\n{0, \u221e} is the vertical coordinate semi\u2013axis, and generally in (z, y) coordinates of\nH3 we have\na \u2217 {c, d} = (0, |z|), b \u2217 {c, d} = (0, 1),\nordist ((0, |z|), (0, 1)) = \u2212log |z|.\nOn the other hand, using the notation of (1.1), we obtain\ng((a) \u2212 (b), (c) \u2212 (d)) = log\n\n|w(a)\u2212(b) (c)|\n= log |z|.\n|w(a)\u2212(b) (d)|\n\nThe middle term of this formula involves the classical cross\u2013ratio of four points on\na projective line, for which it is convenient to have a special notation:\nha, b, c, di :=\n\nw(a)\u2212(b) (c)\n.\nw(a)\u2212(b) (d)\n\n(1.5)\n\nIt is interesting to notice that not only the absolute value, but the argument of\nthe cross\u2013ratio (1.5) as well admits a bulk space interpretation:\narg\n\nw(a)\u2212(b) (c)\n= \u2212\u03c8{c,d} (a, b) ,\nw(a)\u2212(b) (d)\n\n(1.6)\n\nHere we denote by \u03c8\u03b3 (a, b) the oriented angle between the geodesics joining a \u2217 \u03b3\nto a and b \u2217 \u03b3 to b, which can be measured after the parallel translation to, say, a.\nFor a proof of this and other details we refer to [Man2], Prop. 2.2.\nThis expression is relevant in at least two contexts. First, it shows how the\ncharacteristics of rotating black holes are encoded in the complex geometry of the\nboundary (cf. (1.8) below for the genus 1 case). Second, it demonstrates that our\nformulas for the Green functions g(A, B) given below can be refined to provide\nthe bulk space avatars of the complex analytic expressions such that exp g(A, B)\nis the modulus squared of such expression. This is the well known phenomenon of\nholomorphic factorization.\nWe will now introduce a Schottky group \u0393 acting upon H3 \u222a P1 (C) and consider\nthe respective quotient spaces. The boundary will become a complex Riemann\nsurface X(C), whose genus equals to number of generators of \u0393, and the bulk space\nturns into a handlebody \u0393\\H3 \"filling\" this surface.\n\n\f7\n\nThe boundary/bulk expressions for degree zero Green's functions and related\nquantities will be obtained from (1.3) with the help of an appropriate averaging\nover \u0393. The geodesic configuration involved in the right hand side of (1.3) will have\nto be supplemented by its \u0393\u2013shifts and then projected into the handlebody. After\nsuch a projection, however, an expression like a \u2217 \u03b3 will have to be replaced by an\ninfinite sum over all geodesics starting, say, at a boundary point a and crossing\n\u03b3 orthogonally. Interpreting distances between such points involved in (1.3) also\nbecomes a trickier business: the geodesic along which we measure this distance has\nto be made explicit. We will provide the details for the genus one case in 1.3 below.\nAfter gaining some experience, we can restrict ourselves to working in the covering\nbulk space H3 : it is well known that the geometry of non\u2013simply connected spaces is\nbest described in terms of the universal cover and its group of deck transformations.\nIn 1.4 we explain this geometry for genus \u2265 2 case.\n1.3. Genus 1 case and Euclidean BTZ black holes. Ba\u00f1ados\u2013Teitelboim\u2013\nZanelli black holes ([BTZ]) are asymptotically AdS space\u2013times which are obtained\nby global identifications of AdS2+1 by a discrete group of isometries \u0393 generated\nby a single loxodromic element.\nThe group of isometries of AdS2+1 is SO(2, 2) as can be seen by considering the\nhyperboloid model of anti de Sitter space \u2212t2 \u2212 u2 + x2 + y 2 = \u22121 in R2,2 .\nThe non\u2013rotating case (see [ABBHP], [Kr1]) corresponds to the case where the\ngroup \u0393 lies in a diagonal SO(2, 1) \u223c\n= P SL(2, R) in SO(2, 2). In this case, there\nis a surface of time symmetry. This t = 0 slice is a two\u2013dimensional Euclidean\nsignature space with constant negative curvature, hence it has the geometry of the\nreal hyperbolic plane H2 . The fundamental domain for the action of \u0393 on the t = 0\nslice is given by a region in H2 bounded by two non\u2013intersecting infinite geodesics,\nand the group \u0393 is generated by the element of P SL(2, R) that identifies the two\nnon\u2013intersecting geodesics in the boundary of the fundamental domain, creating\na surface with the topology of S 1 \u00d7 R. The BTZ black hole is then obtained\nby evolving this t = 0 surface in the time direction in AdS2+1 , until it develops\nsingularities at past and future infinity. The time evolution of the two geodesics in\nthe boundary of the fundamental domain gives geodesic surfaces that are joined at\nthe past and future singularities. The geodesic arc realizing the path of minimal\nlength between the two non\u2013intersecting geodesics is the event horizon of the BTZ\nblack hole (see [ABBHP], [BTZ], [Kr1] for further details).\nThe Euclidean analog of the BTZ black hole is given by realizing the H2 slice as\na hyperplane in H3 and \"evolving\" it by continuing the geodesics in H2 to geodesic\nsurfaces in H3 . This produces a fundamental domain of the form illustrated in the\nFig 2.\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 2\nThe group \u0393 \u223c\n= q Z is a Schottky group of rank one in P SL(2, C), generated by\nthe choice of an element q \u2208 C\u2217 , |q| < 1. It acts on H3 by\n\u0012 1/2\n\u0013\nq\n0\n(z, y) = (qz, |q|y).\n(1.7)\n0\nq \u22121/2\nThe quotient Xq = H3 /(q Z ) is a solid torus with a hyperbolic structure and with\nthe Jacobi uniformized elliptic curve Xq (C) = C\u2217 /(q Z ) as its boundary at infinity.\nThe fundamental domain depicted on Fig. 2 is |q|2 < |z| \u2264 1, |q|2 < |z|2 + y 2 \u2264 1.\nThe physical meaning of q is clarified by the following expression:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0(i|r\u2212 | \u2212 r+ )\n,\n(1.8)\nq = exp\nl\nwhere the parameters r\u00b1 depend on mass M and angular momentum J of the black\nhole,\n\u0011\np\n1\u0010\n2\nM l \u00b1 M 2 l2 + J ,\nr\u00b1\n=\n2\nand l determines the cosmological constant \u039b = \u22121/l2 and normalizes the metric\nas\nl2\n2\nds = 2 (|dz|2 + dy 2 ).\ny\nThis can be seen by writing the coordinates in the upper half space model of H3\nin terms of Schwarzschild coordinates (r, \u03c4, \u03c6) with Euclidean time \u03c4 ,\nz=\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nr 2 \u2212 r+\n2\nr 2 \u2212 r\u2212\n\n\u00131/2\n\nexp\n\n\u0012\u0012\n\n|r\u2212 |\nr+\n\u03c6\u2212 2 \u03c4\nl\nl\n\n\u0013\n\n+i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0013\n|r\u2212 |\nr+\n\u03c4+\n\u03c6\n,\nl2\nl\n\n\f9\n\ny=\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n2\nr+\n\u2212 r\u2212\n2\nr 2 \u2212 r\u2212\n\n\u00131/2\n\nexp\n\n\u0012\n\n|r\u2212 |\nr+\n\u03c6\u2212 2 \u03c4\nl\nl\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThe transformation (1.6) can then be written as\n(z, y) 7\u2192 (e2\u03c0(i|r\u2212 |\u2212r+ )/l z, e\u22122\u03c0r+ /l y).\nThis was already observed in [BKSW]. For r\u2212 6= 0, that is, not purely real q,\nthe quotient space Xq (C) represents a spinning black hole. We normalized our\ncoordinates so that l = 1.\n1.3.1. Determinant of the Dirac operator and Green's function. There\nare explicit formulas in terms of theta functions for the determinant of the Dirac\noperator twisted with a flat bundle on an elliptic curve. For a parameterized family\nof Dirac operators DP , with P a Poincar\u00e9 line bundle, whose restriction to a fiber\nXq over L \u2208 P ic0 (Xq ) is isomorphic to L, it is proved in [RS] that, up to a constant\nphase, we have\ndet DP (q; u, v) = q\n\nB2 (v)\n2\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nn=1\n\n1 \u2212 q n\u2212v e2\u03c0iu\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 q n+v\u22121 e\u22122\u03c0iu ,\n\n(1.9)\n\nwith B2 (v) = v 2 \u2212 v + 1/6 the second Bernoulli polynomial. It is shown in [AMV]\nthat (1.9) is the operator product expansion of the path integral for fermions on\nthe elliptic curve Xq .\nOn the other hand, the Arakelov Green function on Xq is essentially the logarithm of the absolute value of this expression:\n!\n\u221e\nY\n|1 \u2212 q n z| |1 \u2212 q n z \u22121 |\n(1.10)\ng(z, 1) = log |q|B2 (log |z|/ log |q|)/2 |1 \u2212 z|\nn=1\n\n(see [Man2], (4.6)).\nTo interpret various terms of (1.10) via geodesic configurations, we use (1.3)\nand (1.5) for various choices of the cross\u2013ratio, for example, |x| = |hx, 1, 0, \u221ei|,\n|1 \u2212 x| = |hx, 0, 1, \u221ei|. More precisely, we introduce the following notation:\n\u2022 {0, \u221e} in H3 becomes the closed geodesic \u03b30 in the solid torus Xq . Its length\nis l(\u03b30 ) = \u2212log |q| (cf. (1.6).)\n\u2022 Choose a point x on the elliptic curve Xq and denote by the same letter x its\nunique lift to C satisfying |q| < |x| \u2264 1. In particular, 1 denotes both the number\nand the identity point of Xq .\n\u2022 Denote by x\u0304 the point x \u2217 {0, \u221e} and also its image in \u03b30 . Similarly, denote\nby 1\u0304 = 1 \u2217 {0, \u221e} = (0, 1) \u2208 H3 and the respective point in \u03b30 .\nFig. 3a depicts the relevant configurations:\n\n\f10\n\noo\n\nH\n\n3\nX\n\nq\n\n1\nx\n\nx\n\n1\n\n1\n\nx\n\n0\n1\n\nx\n\nFig. 3a\n\u2022 Denote the image of {1, \u221e} by \u03b31 .

We leave this as\nan exercise for the reader.\n1.4. Genus \u2265 2 case and Krasnov's Euclidean black holes. The construction of the BTZ black hole with Lorentzian signature can be generalized to other\nasymptotically AdS2+1 solutions, by prescribing global identifications on the t = 0\nslice H2 of AdS2+1 , obtained by the action of a discrete subgroup of P SL(2, R).\nSolutions of this type are described in [ABBHP]. They admit a Euclidean version\nwhich is a global quotient of H3 by the action of a discrete group of isometries \u0393.\nWe are especially interested in the case where \u0393 \u2282 P SL(2, C) is a geometrically\nfinite Schottky group. Such solutions were studied by Krasnov [Kr1], [Kr4], so we\nrefer to them as Krasnov black holes. For this class of space\u2013times, in the Euclidean\ncase, the bulk space is a hyperbolic handlebody of genus g \u2265 2, and the surface\nat infinity is a compact Riemann surface of genus g, with the complex structure\ndetermined by the Schottky uniformization.\n\n1.4.1. Schottky groups and handlebodies. (i) Loxodromic elements. As in\n1.2, we choose a 2\u2013dimensional complex vector space V and study the group P GL(2)\nand various spaces upon which it acts. A loxodromic element g \u2208 P GL(2, V ), by\ndefinition, has two different fixed points in P (V ) = P1 (C), the attracting one z + (g)\nand the repelling one z \u2212 (g). The eigenvalue q(g) of g on the complex tangent space\nto z + (g) is called the multiplier of g. We have |q(g)| < 1.\n\n(ii) Schottky groups. A Schottky group is a finitely generated discrete subgroup\n\u0393 \u2282 P GL(V ) consisting of loxodromic elements and identity. It is always free; its\nminimal number of generators p is called genus. Each Schottky group of genus p\nadmits a marking. By definition, this is a family of 2p open connected domains\nD1 , . . . , D2p in P (V ) and a family of generators g1 , . . . , gp \u2208 \u0393 with the following\n\n\f12\n\nproperties. The boundary Ci of Di is a Jordan curve homeomorphic to S 1 , closures\nof Di are pairwise disjoint; moreover, gk (Ck ) \u2282 Cp+k , and gk (Dk ) \u2282 P (V ) \\ Dp+k .\nA marking is called classical, if all Di are circles. Every Schottky group admits a\nmarking, but there are groups for which no classical marking exists.\n(iii) \u0393\u2013invariant sets and their quotients. Any Schottky group \u0393 of genus p acts\non HV faithfully and discretely. The quotient X\u0393 := \u0393 \u2282 HV is (the interior of) a\nhandlebody of genus p.\nChoose a marking and put\nX0,\u0393 := P (V ) \\ \u222apk=1 (Dk \u222a Dk+p ), \u03a9\u0393 := \u222ag\u2208\u0393 g(X0,\u0393).\n\u0393 acts on \u03a9\u0393 faithfully and discretely, X0,\u0393 is a fundamental domain for this action,\nand the quotient \u0393 \\ \u03a9\u0393 is a complex Riemann surface of genus p. Every Riemann\nsurface admits infinitely many different Schottky covers.\nIn the representation above, \u0393 acts upon \u03a9\u0393 as on the boundary of a tubular\nneighborhood of a Cayley graph of \u0393 associated with generators gk . Since they are\nfree, the Cayley graph is an infinite tree each vertex of which has multiplicity 2p:\ncf. Fig. 4 illustrating this for the case p = 2.\n\nFig. 4\n\n\f13\n\nAs above, X\u0393 can be identified with the boundary at infinity of X\u0393 : the set\nof equivalence classes of unbounded ends of geodesics in X\u0393 modulo the relation\n\"distance = 0.\"\nA marking of \u0393 induces a marking of the 1\u2013homology group H1 (X\u0393 , Z). Concretely, denote by ak the class of the image of Cp+k (with its natural orientation.)\nChoose some points xk \u2208 Ck , k = 1, . . . , p, and pairwise disjoint oriented paths\nfrom xk to gk (xk ) lying in X0,\u0393 . Denote by bk their classes in H1 (X\u0393 , Z). Clearly,\n{ak , bl } form a basis of this group, satisfying (ak , al ) = (bk , bl ) = 0, (ak , bl ) = \u03b4kl .\nMoreover, ak generate the kernel of the map H1 (X\u0393 , Z) \u2192 H1 (X \u0393 , Z) induced by\nthe inclusion of the boundary.\nThe complement \u039b\u0393 := P (V ) \\ \u03a9\u0393 is the minimal non\u2013empty \u0393\u2013invariant set.\nEquivalently, it is the closure of the set of all fixed points z \u00b1 (g), g \u2208 \u0393, g 6= id, or\nelse the set of limit points of any orbit \u0393z0 , z0 \u2208 HV \u222a P (V ).\nIf g = 1, \u039b\u0393 consists of two points which can be chosen as 0, \u221e. For g \u2265 2, \u039b\u0393\ngenerally is an uncountable Cantor set (fractal). This is the main source of complications (and interesting developments). Denote by a(\u0393) the Hausdorff dimension\nof \u039b(\u0393). It can be characterized as the convergence abscissa of any Poincar\u00e9 series\nX dg(z)\ndz\n\ns\n\ng\u2208\u0393\n\nwhere z is any coordinate function on P (V ) with a zero and a pole in \u03a9\u0393 . Generally\n0 < a(\u0393) < 2. Convergence of our holography formulas below will hold only for\na(\u0393) < 1. For other characterizations of a(\u0393), see [Man2], p. 236, and the references\ntherein.\nGeodesics in the bulk space HV with ends on \u039b\u0393 become exactly all bounded\ngeodesics in the quotient X\u0393 . Their convex hull C\u0393 is called the convex core of X\u0393 .\nThe group \u0393 is geometrically finite if the convex core C\u0393 is of finite volume. In this\ncase, the core C\u0393 is a compact 3\u2013manifold with boundary, which is homeomorphic\nto and a strong deformation retract of X\u0393 .\n1.4.2. AdS and Euclidean black holes. Consider a Fuchsian Schottky group\n\u0393 acting on H2 . The resulting quotient space is a non\u2013compact Riemann surface\nwith a certain number of infinite ends. The genus of the surface and the number\nof ends depend on the Schottky group, for instance, both topologies shown in the\nFig. 5 arise as quotients of H2 by a Schottky group with two generators.\n\n\f14\n\nFig. 5\nAn asymptotically AdS non\u2013spinning black hole is obtained by extending these\nidentifications globally to AdS2+1 , or, in other words, by evolving the t = 0 slice\nforward and backward in time. The geodesic surfaces extending the geodesics in\nthe boundary of the fundamental domain in the t = 0 slice develop singularities in\nboth forward and backward direction (see [ABBHP], [Kr1]) as illustrated in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6\nThe procedure used by Krasnov [Kr1] to construct the Euclidean version of these\nblack holes follows the same line as in the case of the BTZ black hole, namely, the\nt = 0 slice is identified with a hyperplane in H3 and the geodesics in this hyperplane\nare continued to geodesic surfaces in H3 . The resulting quotients are special cases\n(non\u2013rotating black holes) of the handlebodies X\u0393 constructed above in 1.4.1, in\nthe case of real Schottky parameters. The general case of 1.4.1 includes also the\nmore general case of spinning black holes considered by Krasnov in [Kr4].\nSince Fuchsian Schottky groups are classical Schottky groups, the black holes\nobtained by the construction of Krasnov as Euclidean versions of the AdS black\nholes of [ABBHP] are quotients of H3 by a classical Schottky group on p generators,\nand the fundamental domain is a region in H3 delimited by 2p pairwise disjoint\ngeodesic half spheres.\nAs observed in [BKSW], the kinematic part of the Maldacena correspondence for\nspacetimes that are global quotients of H3 by a geometrically finite discrete group\nof isometries is provided by the correspondence between hyperbolic structures on\n\n\f15\n\nthe bulk space and conformal structures on the boundary at infinity, [Sul]. (cf. also\n[Kh] on the correspondence between hyperbolic and conformal geometry viewed\nin the light of holography.) Below we will complement this by providing some\ndynamical content for the case of the Krasnov black holes.\n1.5. Abelian differentials and Green functions on Schottky covers. In\nthis subsection, we will calculate Green's functions of the form (1.2) for curves with\na Schottky cover. The differentials of the third kind which can be obtained by a\ndirect averaging of simple functions do not necessarily have pure imaginary periods.\nTo remedy this, we will have to subtract from them some differentials of the first\nkind. Therefore we will start with the latter.\n1.5.1. Differentials of the first kind. In the genus one case, if z is the\nprojective coordinate whose divisor consists of the attractive and repelling point of\na generator of \u0393, a differential of the first kind can be written as\nw(0)\u2212(\u221e) (z)\n= d log h0, \u221e, z, z0 i\nw(0)\u2212(\u221e) (z0 )\n\n\u03c9 = d log z = d log\n\nwhere z0 is any point 6= 0, \u221e. Generally, an appropriate averaging of this formula\nproduces a differential of the first kind \u03c9g for any g \u2208 \u0393. In the following we assume\nthat a marking of \u0393 is chosen. Denote by C(|g) a set of representatives of \u0393/(g Z ),\nby C(h|g) a similar set for (hZ ) \\ \u0393/(g Z ), and by S(g) the conjugacy class of g in\n\u0393. Then we have for any z0 \u2208 \u03a9\u0393 :\n1.5.2. Proposition. (a) If a(\u0393) < 1, the following series converges absolutely\nfor z \u2208 \u03a9\u0393 and determines (the lift to \u03a9\u0393 of ) a differential of the first kind on X\u0393 :\n\u03c9g =\n\nX\n\nh\u2208C(|g)\n\ndz log hhz + (g), hz \u2212 (g), z, z0 i .\n\n(1.12)\n\nThis differential does not depend on z0 , and depends on g additively.\nIf the class of g is primitive (i. e. non\u2013divisible in H), \u03c9g can be rewritten as\n\u03c9g =\n\nX\n\nh\u2208S(g)\n\ndz log hz + (h), z \u2212 (h), z, z0 i .\n\n(1.13)\n\n(b) If gk form a part of the marking of \u0393, and ak are the homology classes\ndescribed in 1.4.1 (iii), we have\nZ\n\nak\n\n\u03c9gl = 2\u03c0i \u03b4kl .\n\n(1.14)\n\n\f16\n\nIt follows that the map g mod [\u0393, \u0393] 7\u2192 \u03c9g embeds H := \u0393/[\u0393, \u0393] as a sublattice in\nthe space of all differentials of the first kind.\n(c) Denote by {bl } the complementary set of homology classes in H1 (X\u0393 , Z) as\nin 1.4.1. Then we have for k 6= l, with an appropriate choice of logarithm branches:\n\u03c4kl :=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9g l =\nbk\n\nX\n\nh\u2208C(gk |gl )\n\nlog hz + (gk ), z \u2212 (gk ), hz + (gl ), hz \u2212 (gl )i .\n\n(1.15)\n\nFinally\n\u03c4kk = log q(gk ) +\n\nX\n\nh\u2208C0 (gk |gk )\n\nlog hz + (gk ), z \u2212 (gk ), hz + (gk ), hz \u2212 (gk )i .\n\n(1.16)\n\nwhere in C0 (gk |gk ) is C(gk |gk ) without the identity class.\nFor proofs, see [Man2], \u00a78, and [ManD]. Notice that our notation here slightly\ndiffers from [Man2]; in particular, \u03c4kl here corresponds to 2\u03c0i\u03c4kl of [Man2].\nIn the holography formulas below we will use (1.15) and (1.16) in order to calculate Re \u03c4kl . The ambiguity of phases can then be discarded, and the cross\u2013ratios\nmust be replaced by their absolute values. Each resulting term can then be interpreted via a configuration of geodesics in the bulk spaces H3 and X\u0393 , similar to\nthose displayed in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b.\n1.5.3. Differentials of the third kind and Green's functions. Let now\na, b \u2208 \u03a9\u0393 . Again assuming a(\u0393) < 1, we see that the series\n\u03bd(a)\u2212(b) :=\n\nX\n\nh\u2208\u0393\n\ndz log ha, b, hz, hz0 i\n\n(1.17)\n\nabsolutely converges and represents the lift to \u03a9\u0393 of a differential of the third kind\nwith residues \u00b11 at the images of P\na, b. Moreover, its ak periods vanish. Therefore,\nany linear combination \u03bd(a)\u2212(b) \u2212 l Xl (a, b)\u03c9gl with real coefficients Xl will have\npure imaginary ak \u2013periods in view of (1.14).\nP If we find Xl so that the real parts\nof the bk \u2013periods of \u03c9(a)\u2212(b) := \u03bd(a)\u2212(b) \u2212 l Xl (a, b)\u03c9gl vanish, we will be able to\nuse this differential in order to calculate conformally invariant Green's functions.\nHence our final formulas look as follows.\nEquations for calculating Xl (a, b):\np\nX\nl=1\n\nXl (a, b) Re \u03c4kl = Re\n\nZ\n\nbk\n\n\u03bd(a)\u2212(b) =\n\nX\n\nh\u2208S(gk )\n\nlog |ha, b, z + (h), z \u2212 (h)i| .\n\n(1.18)\n\n\f17\n\nHere k runs over 1, . . . , p, Re \u03c4kl are calculated by means of (1.15) and (1.16), and\nbk \u2013periods of \u03bd(a)\u2212(b) are given in \u00a78 of [Man2].\nMoreover,\n\nRe\n\nZ\n\nc\n\n\u03bd(a)\u2212(b) =\n\nd\n\nRe\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nlog |ha, b, hc, hdi| ,\n\n(1.19)\n\nlog |hz + (h), z \u2212 (h), c, di| ,\n\n(1.20)\n\nh\u2208\u0393\n\nc\n\n\u03c9g l =\nd\n\nX\n\nh\u2208S(gl )\n\nHence finally\ng((a) \u2212 (b), (c) \u2212 (d)) =\nX\n\nh\u2208\u0393\n\nlog |ha, b, hc, hdi| \u2212\n\np\nX\nl=1\n\nXl (a, b)\n\nX\n\nh\u2208S(gl )\n\nlog |hz + (h), z \u2212 (h), c, di| .\n\n(1.20)\n\nHere we have to thank Annette Werner for correcting the last formula in [Man2].\n1.6. Discussion. (i) The most straightforward way to interpret formulas (1.3),\n(1.4), (1.11), (1.20) is to appeal to the picture of holographic particle detection of\n[BR]. In this picture, Green functions on the boundary detect geodesic movement\nand collisions of massive particles in the bulk space. Particles, being local objects,\nexist in the semiclassical limit.\nMore precisely, consider in the bulk space the theory of a scalar field of mass m.\nThe propagator, in the notation of [BR] p.7, is\nG(B(z), B(\u2212z)) =\n\nZ\n\nDP ei\u2206l(P ) ,\n\n(1.21)\n\n\u221a\nwhere l(P ) is the length of the path P ,\u2206 = 1 + 1 + m2 , and the points B(\u00b1z) in\nthe bulk space correspond to some parameterized curve b(\u00b1z) on the boundary at\ninfinity, in the sense that the B(\u00b1z) lie on a hypersurface obtained by introducing\na cutoff on the bulk space.\nIn the semiclassical WKB approximation, the right hand side of (1.21) localizes\nat the critical points of action. Thus, it becomes a sum over geodesics connecting\nthe points B(\u00b1z),\nX\nG(B(z), B(\u2212z)) =\ne\u2212\u2206l(\u03b3) .\n(1.22)\n\u03b3\n\nThis has a logarithmic divergence when the cutoff \u01eb \u2192 0, that is, when the points\nB(\u00b1z) approach the corresponding points on the boundary at infinity.\n\n\f18\n\nOn the other hand, for the CFT on the boundary (in the case where the bulk\nspace is just AdS3 ), the boundary propagator is taken in the form in the form (pp.\n6\u20137 of [BR])\n1\n.\nhO(x), O(x\u2032 )i =\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |2\u2206\nIn the case where the bulk space is globally AdS3 , there is an identification of the\npropagators as the cutoff parameter \u01eb \u2192 0\nT (z) \u2261 log G(B(z), B(\u2212z)),\nafter removing the logarithmic divergence, where\nT (z) = loghO(b(z)), O(b(\u2212z))i.\nThe appearance of the geodesic propagator (1.21) in the bulk space, written in the\nform (1.22) is somewhat similar to our exact formulas written in terms of geodesic\nconfigurations.\nMoreover, passing to the Euclidean case, and reading our formula (1.3) for the\ngenus zero case in this context provides a neater way of identifying propagators on\nbulk and boundary which does not require any cutoff. For assigned points on the\nboundary P1 (C), instead of choosing corresponding points in the bulk space B(\u00b1z)\nwith the help of a cutoff function and then comparing propagators in the limit, any\nchoice of a divisor (a) \u2212 (b) determines the points in the bulk space a \u2217 {c, d} and\nb \u2217 {c, d} in H3 , for boundary points c, d \u2208 P1 (C), and a corresponding exact\nidentification of the propagators.\nIf we then let a \u2192 c and b \u2192 d, in (1.3) both the Green function and the\ngeodesic length have a logarithmic divergence, as the points a \u2217 {c, d} and b \u2217 {c, d}\nalso tend to the boundary points c and d, and this recovers the identification of\nthe propagators used by the physicists as a limit case of formula (1.3), without any\nneed to introduce cutoff functions.\nNotice, moreover, that the procedure of \u00a71.5.3, and in particular our (1.18) to\ncompute the coefficients Xl (a, b) is analogous to the derivation of the bosonic field\npropagator for algebraic curves in [FeSo], with the sole difference that, in the linear\ncombination\nX\n\u03c9(a)\u2212(b) := \u03bd(a)\u2212(b) \u2212\nXl (a, b)\u03c9gl ,\nl\n\ncf. equation (3.6) of [FeSo], the differentials of the third kind \u03bd(a)\u2212(b) are determined\nin our (1.17) by the data of the Schottky uniformization, while, in the case considered in [FeSo], they are obtained by describing the algebraic curve as a branched\ncover of P1 (C). Then our (1.18) corresponds to (3.9) of [FeSo], and Proposition\n\n\f19\n\n1.5.2 shows that the bosonic field propagator on the algebraic curve X(C), described by the Green function, can be expressed in terms of geodesics in the bulk\nspace.\n(ii) K. Krasnov in [Kr1] (cf. also [Kr2]\u2013[Kr4]) establishes another holography\ncorrespondence which involves CFT interpreted as geometry of the Teichm\u00fcller or\nSchottky moduli space rather than that of an individual Riemann surface and its\nbulk handlebody. In his picture, the relevant CFT theory is the Liouville theory\n(existence of which is not yet fully established). An appropriate action for Liouville\ntheory in terms of the Schottky uniformization was suggested L. Takhtajan and\nP. Zograf in [TaZo]. Krasnov identifies the value of this action at the stationary\n(\"uniformizing\") point with the regularized volume of the respective Euclidean\nbulk space. According to [TaZo], this value provides the K\u00e4hler potential for the\nWeil\u2013Petersson metric on the moduli space.\nIt would be interesting to clarify the geometric meaning of Krasnov's regularized\nvolume. Can it be calculated through the volume of the convex core of the bulk\nspace? In the genus one case the answer is positive: both quantities are proportional\nto the length of the closed geodesic.\nA recent preprint of J. Brock [Br1] establishes an approximate relationship between the Weil\u2013Petersson metric and volumes of convex cores in a different, but\nrelated situation. Namely, instead of giving a local formula for the WP\u2013distance\n\"at a point\" X, it provides an approximate formula for this distance between two\nRiemann surfaces X, Y which are far apart. The handlebody X filling X is replaced\nby the quasi\u2013Fuchsian hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold Q(X, Y ) arising in the Bers simultaneous uniformization picture ([Be]) and having X \u222a Y as its conformal boundary\nat infinity. It turns out that at large distances lW P (X, Y ) is comparable with the\nvolume of core Q(X, Y ).\nWe expect that an exact formula relating these two quantities exists and might\nbe derived using a version of Krasnov's arguments.\nIn fact, the Krasnov black holes also have a description in terms of Bers simultaneous uniformization. By the results of Bowen [Bow], a collection C0 of pairwise\ndisjoint rectificable arcs in X0,\u0393 with ends at xk \u2208 Ck and gk (xk ), as described\nin \u00a71.4.1(iii), determine a quasi\u2013circle C = \u222a\u03b3\u2208\u0393 \u03b3C0 . The quotient (C \u2229 \u03a9\u0393 )/\u0393\nconsists of a collection of closed curves in X\u0393 whose homology classes give the bk of\n\u00a71.4.1(iii). The quasi\u2013circle C divides P1 (C) into two domains of Bers simultaneous\nuniformization, with the handlebody X\u0393 (topologically a product of a non\u2013compact\nRiemann surface and an interval) in the role of Q(X, Y ). This fits in with the results of Krasnov on the generally rotating case of Krasnov black holes discussed in\n[Kr4].\n\n\f20\n\n1.7. Non\u2013archimedean holography. According to various speculations,\nspace\u2013time at the Planck scale should be enriched with non\u2013archimedean geometry, possibly in ad\u00e8lic form, so that space\u2013time can be seen simultaneously at\nall non\u2013archimedean and archimedean places. From this perspective, it is worth\nobserving that the holography correspondence described in \u00a71 admits a natural extension to the non\u2013archimedean setting. In fact, the results of [Man2] on the Green\nfunctions on Riemann surfaces with Schottky uniformization and configurations of\ngeodesics in the bulk space were motivated by the theory of p\u2013adic Schottky groups\nand Mumford curves: cf. [Mum], [ManD], [GvP].\nIn the non\u2013archimedean setting, we consider a finite extension K of Qp . Anti\nde Sitter space, or rather its Euclidean analog H3 , is replaced by the Bruhat\u2013Tits\ntree T with the set of vertices\nT 0 = {A\u2013lattices of rank 2 in a 2\u2013dim K\u2013space V }/K \u2217\n\n(1.22)\n\nwhere A is the ring of integers of K. Vertices have valence |P1 (A/m)|, where m is\nthe maximal ideal, and the length of each edge connecting two nearby vertices is\nlog |A/m|. The set of ends of the tree T can be identified with P1 (K): this is the\nanalog of the conformal boundary.\nThe analog in [ManD] of the formulas of Lemma 1.1.3, gives a quantitative\nformulation of the holographic correspondence in this non\u2013archimedean setting,\nwith the basic Green function on T given by\nG\u03bc(u) (x, y) = distT (u, {x, y}),\n\n(1.23)\n\nwhere the metric on the Bruhat\u2013Tits tree T is defined by assigning the length\nlog |A/m| to each edge, so that (1.23) computes the length of the shortest chain of\nedges connecting the vertex u to the doubly infinite path in the tree containing the\nvertices x, y.\nA triple of points in P1 (K) determines a unique vertex v \u2208 T 0 where the three\nends connecting v to the given points in P1 (K) start along different edges. This\nconfiguration of edges is called a \"cross\u2013roads\" in [Man2]. It provides an analog of\nthe Feynman diagram of \u00a72.4 of [Wi], where currents are inserted at points on the\nboundary and the interaction takes place in the interior, with half infinite paths in\nthe Bruhat\u2013Tits tree acting as the gluon propagators. Such propagators admit a\nnice arithmetic description in terms of reduction modulo the maximal ideal m.\nFor a subgraph of T given by the half infinite path starting at a given vertex\nv \u2208 T 0 with end x \u2208 P1 (K), let {v0 = v, v1 , . . . , vn . . . } be the sequence of vertices\nalong this path. We can define a 'non\u2013archimedean gluon propagator' as such\na graph together with the maps that assign to each finite path {v0 , . . . , vn } the\nreduction of x modulo mn .\n\n\f21\n\nConsider the example of the elliptic curve with the Jacobi\u2013Tate uniformization\nK /(q Z ), with q \u2208 K \u2217 , |q| < 1. The group q Z acts on T like the cyclic group\ngenerated by an arbitrary hyperbolic element \u03b3 \u2208 P GL(2, K). The unique doubly\ninfinite path in T with ends at the pair of fixed points x\u00b1 of \u03b3 in P1 (K) gives rise\nto a closed ring in the quotient T /\u0393.\n\u2217\n\nThe quotient space T /\u0393 is the non\u2013archimedean version of the BTZ black hole,\nand this closed ring is the event horizon. From the vertices of this closed ring\ninfinite ends depart, which correspond to the reduction map X(K) \u2192 X(A/m).\n\nSubgraphs of the graph T /\u0393 correspond to all possible Feynman diagrams of\npropagation between boundary sources on the Tate elliptic curve X(K) and interior\nvertices on the closed ring.\nIn the case of higher genus, the Schottky group \u0393 is a purely loxodromic free\ndiscrete subgroup of P SL(2, K) of rank g \u2265 2. The doubly infinite paths in T with\nends at the pairs of fixed points x\u00b1 (\u03b3) of the elements \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 realize T\u0393 as a subtree\nof T . This is the analog of realizing the union of fundamental domains \u222a\u03b3 \u03b3(F ) as\na tubular neighborhood of the Cayley graph of \u0393 in the archimedeam case. The\nends of the subtree T\u0393 constitute the limit set \u039b\u0393 \u2282 P1 (K). The complement\n\u03a9\u0393 = P1 (K) r \u039b\u0393 gives the uniformization of the Mumford curve X(K) \u2243 \u03a9\u0393 /\u0393.\nThis, in turn, can be identified with the ends of the quotient graph T /\u0393.\nThe quotients X\u0393 = T /\u0393 are non\u2013archimedean Krasnov black holes, with boundary at infinity the Mumford curve X(K). Currents at points in X(K) propagate\nalong the half infinite paths in the black hole that reaches a vertex on T\u0393 /\u0393. Propagation between interior points happen along edges of T\u0393 /\u0393, and loops in this graph\ngive rise to quantum corrections to the correlation functions of currents in the\nboundary field theory, as happens with the Feynman diagrams of [Wi].\n\n1.8. Holography and arithmetic topology. We have seen that, for an\narithmetic surface XZ \u2192 Spec Z, it is possible to relate the geometry at arithmetic\ninfinity to the physical principle of holography. Over a prime p, in the case of curves\nwith maximally degenerate reduction, it is also possible to interpret the resulting\nMumford theory of p\u2013adic Schottky uniformization in terms of an arithmetic version\nof the holography principle. One can therefore formulate the question of whether\nsome other arithmetic analog of holography persists for closed fibers XZ mod p.\nA very different picture of the connection between 3\u2013manifolds and arithmetics\nexists in the context of arithmetic topology, a term introduced by Reznikov [Rez] to\ncharacterize a dictionary of analogies between number fields and 3\u2013manifolds. See\nalso a nice overview by McMullen [Mc].\nAccording to this dictionary, if L is a number field and OL its ring of algebraic\nintegers, then B = Spec OL is an analog of a 3\u2013manifold, with primes representing\n\n\f22\n\nloops (knots in a 3\u2013manifold). In our case, with B = Spec Z, the local fundametal\ngroup Gal(F\u0304p /Fp ) \u223c\n= \u1e90 is generated by the Frobenius \u03c3p : x 7\u2192 xp acting on F\u0304p .\nThe fiber of X over a prime p, in the dictionary of arithmetic topology, may\nbe regarded as a 3\u2013manifold that fibers over a circle. In fact, for a fixed prime\nl, let S be the union of l and the set of primes where X has bad reduction. Let\nB = Spec S \u22121 Z. This satisfies \u03c0\u03021 (B) = Gal(Q\u0304S /Q). For p \u2208\n/ S, the l\u2013adic Galois\nrepresentation\n\u03c1\u0302l : Gal(Q\u0304S /Q) \u2192 AutH1 (X, Zl ) = GL(2g, Zl)\ngives an arithmetic version of the monodromy, see [Mc], with the Frobenius \u03c3p that\nlifts to an element of Gal(Q\u0304S /Q). In the arithmetic topology dictionary, a prime p\ncorresponds to a \"loop\" in the \"3\u2013manifold\" B, hence the fiber XZ mod p together\nwith the Frobenius element \u03c3p can be regarded as the data of a 3\u2013manifold that\nfibers over the \"circle\" p.\nThe question of a holographic correspondence for these arithmetic analogs of\nmapping tori may be related to results of J.Brock [Br2] on 3\u2013manifolds that fiber\nover the circle, where the hyperbolic volume is related to the translation length of\nthe monodromy, in the same way that relates the hyperbolic volume of the convex\ncore to the Weil\u2013Petersson distance of the surfaces at infinity in the case of Bers'\nsimultaneous uniformization in the main result of [Br1].\nIn our perspective, this result of [Br2] can be regarded as an extension of a\nform of holographic correspondence from the case of hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds with\ninfinite ends and asymptotic boundary surfaces, to the case of a compact hyperbolic\n3\u2013manifolds which fibers over the circle, with the information previously carried by\nthe boundary at infinity now residing in the fiber and monodromy. Thus, it is\npossible to ask whether, under the dictionary of arithmetic topology, a similar\nform of holographic correspondence exists for the fibers XZ mod p regarded as\narithmetic analogs of a 3\u2013manifold fibering over the circle with monodromy \u03c3p . It\nis possible that such correspondence may be related to another analogy of arithmetic\ntopology, which interprets the quantity |T r(\u03c3p )| as a measure of the \"hyperbolic\nlength\" of the loop representing the prime p (cf. [Mc] Remark on p.134).\n\u00a72. Modular curves as holograms\nIn this section we suggest a different type of holography correspondence, this\ntime related to AdS1+1 and its Euclidean version H2 .\nIn the case we consider, the bulk spaces will be modular curves. They are global\nquotients of the hyperbolic plane H2 by a finite index subgroup G of P SL(2, Z).\nWe identify H2 with the upper complex half\u2013plane endowed with the metric dx2 /y 2\nof curvature \u22121. Its boundary at infinity is then P1 (R).\n\n\f23\n\nModular curves have a very rich arithmetic structure, forming the essential part\nof the moduli stack of elliptic curves. In this classical setting, the modular curves\nhave a natural algebro\u2013geometric compactification, which consists of adding finitely\nmany points at infinity, the cusps G\\P1 (Q). Cusps are the only boundary points\nat which G acts discretely (with stabilizers of finite index). The remaining part\nof the conformal boundary (after factorization) is not visible in algebraic (or for\nthat matter analytic or C \u221e ) geometry, because irrational orbits of G in P1 (R) are\ndense.\nIn [ManMar] and [Mar] some aspects of the classical geometry and arithmetics\nof modular curves, such as modular symbols, the modular complex, and certain\nclasses of modular forms, are recovered in terms of the non\u2013commutative boundary\nG\\P1 (R) which is a non\u2013commutative space in the sense of Connes, that is, a C \u2217 \u2013\nalgebra Morita equivalent to the crossed product of G acting on some function ring\nof P1 (R). This way, the full geometric boundary of P1 (R) of H2 is considered as\npart of the compactification, instead of just P1 (Q). We argue here that this is the\nright notion of boundary to consider in order to have a holography correspondence\nfor this class of bulk spaces. In particular, since we strive to establish that the\nbulk spaces and their boundaries carry essentially the same information, we call\nthe quotients G\\P1 (R) non\u2013commutative modular curves.\n2.1. Non\u2013commutative modular curves. In the following \u0393 = P SL(2, Z)\nand G is a finite index subgroup of \u0393. Denoting by P the coset space P = \u0393/G, we\ncan represent the modular curve XG := G\\H2 as the quotient\nXG = \u0393\\(H2 \u00d7 P),\n\n(2.1)\n\nand its non\u2013commutative boundary as the C \u2217 \u2013algebra\nC(P1 (R) \u00d7 P) \u22ca \u0393\n\n(2.2)\n\nMorita equivalent to C(P1 (R)) \u22ca G.\nThere is a dynamical system associated to the equivalence relation defined by\nthe action of a Fuchsian group of the first kind on its limit set, as in the case of our\nG\\P1 (R). The dynamical system can be described as a Markov map TG : S 1 \u2192 S 1\nas in [BowSer].\nIn [ManMar] we gave a different formulation in terms of a dynamical system\nrelated to the action of \u0393 on P1 (R) \u00d7 P. This dynamical system generalizes the\nclassical shift of the continued fraction expansion in the form\nT : [0, 1] \u00d7 P \u2192 [0, 1] \u00d7 P\n\u0013 \u0013\n\u0014 \u0015 \u0012\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u2212[1/x] 1\n,\n*t .\n\u2212\nT (x, t) =\n1\n0\nx\nx\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f24\n\nSome aspects of the non\u2013commutative geometry at the boundary of modular curves\ncan be derived from an analysis of the ergodic theory of this dynamical system,\ncf. [ManMar], [Mar].\n2.2. Holography. The 1 + 1\u2013dimensional Anti de Sitter space\u2013time AdS1+1\nhas SL(2, R) as group of isometries. Passing to Euclidean signature, AdS1+1 is\nreplaced by H2 , so that we can regard the modular curves XG as Euclidean versions\nof space\u2013times obtained as global quotients of AdS1+1 by a discrete subgroup of\nisometries. Notice that, unlike the case of spacetimes with AdS2+1 geometry, the\ncase of AdS1+1 space\u2013times is relatively little understood, though some results on\nAdS1+1 holography are formulated in [MMS], [Str]. We argue that one reason for\nthis is that a picture of holography for AdS1+1 space\u2013times should take into account\nthe possible presence of non\u2013commutative geometry at the boundary.\nThere are three types of results from [ManMar] that can be regarded as manifestations of the holography principle. On the bulk space, these results can be\nformulated in terms of the Selberg zeta function, of certain classes of modular\nforms of weight two, and of modular symbols, respectively.\n2.2.1. Selberg zeta function. In order to formulate our first results, we\nconsider the Ruelle transfer operator for the shift (2.3),\n(Ls f )(x, t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\n1\nf\n(x + k)2s\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n,\nx+k\n\n\u0012\n\n0 1\n1 k\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n*t .\n\n(2.4)\n\nOn a suitable Banach space of functions (cf. [May], [ManMar]), the operator Ls\nis nuclear of order zero for Re(s) > 1/2, hence it has a Fredholm determinant\ndet(1 \u2212 Ls ) = exp \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\nTrLl\n\ns\n\nl=1\n\nl\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe Selberg zeta function for the modular curve XG encodes the length spectrum\nof the geodesic flow. Via the Selberg trace formula, this function also encodes\ninformation on the spectral properties of the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator. In terms\nof closed geodesics, we have\nZG (s) =\n\nY\n\n\u221e \u0010\nY\n\n\u03b3\u2208Prim m=0\n\n\u0011\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(s+m) length(\u03b3) ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere Prim is the set of primitive closed geodesics in XG . We have the following\nresult [ManMar] (see also [ChMay], [LewZa1], [LewZa2], [May]).\n\n\f25\n\n2.2.2. Proposition. Consider a finite index subgroup G \u2282 \u0393, with \u0393 = P SL(2, Z)\nor P GL(2, Z). In the case \u0393 = P GL(2, Z) we have\nZG (s) = det(1 \u2212 Ls ),\n\n(2.7)\n\nand in the case \u0393 = P SL(2, Z) we have\nZG (s) = det(1 \u2212 L2s ).\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe can interpret this statement as an instance of holography correspondence,\nif we regard the left hand side of (2.7) and (2.8) as a partition function on the\nbulk space, and the right hand side as the corresponding boundary field theory.\nMore precisely, the results of [Lew], [LewZa1], [LewZa2] provide an explicit correspondence between eigenfunctions of the transfer operator Ls and eigenfunctions\nof the Laplacian (Maass wave forms). This explicit transformation provides a kind\nof holography correspondence between fields on the bulk space and a theory on the\nboundary, which can be interpreted as a lattice spin system with the shift operator\n(2.3).\nTo make a connection to the point of view of Arakelov geometry considered in \u00a71,\nit is known that the Arakelov Green function evaluated at two different cusps can\nbe estimated in terms of the constant term of the Laurent expansion around 1 of the\nlogarithmic derivative of the Selberg zeta function, e.g. in the case of G = \u03930 (N ).\nThis means that, by Proposition 2.2.1, such estimates can be given in terms of the\ntransfer operator Ls , which only depends on the boundary (2.2) of XG .\n2.2.3. Modular symbols. In the classical theory of modular curves, modular\nsymbols are the homology classes\n\u03c6(s) = {g(0), g(i\u221e)}G \u2208 H1 (XG , cusps, Z)\n\n(2.9)\n\nwith gG = s \u2208 P, determined by the image in XG of geodesics in H with ends at\npoints of P1 (Q).\nIn [ManMar] we have shown that the homology H1 (XG , cusps, Z) can be described canonically in terms of the boundary (2.2) in the following way.\n2.2.4. Proposition. In the case \u0393 = P SL(2, Z) = Z/2 \u2217 Z/3, the Pimsner six\nterm exact sequence ([Pim]) for the K\u2013theory of the crossed product C \u2217 \u2013algebra\n(2.2) gives a map\n\u03b1 : K0 (C(P1 (R) \u00d7 P)) \u2192 K0 (C(P1 (R) \u00d7 P) \u22ca Z/2) \u2295 K0 (C(P1 (R) \u00d7 P) \u22ca Z/3).\nThe kernel of this map satisfies\nKer(\u03b1) \u223c\n= H1 (XG , cusps, Z).\n\n(2.10)\n\n\f26\n\nIn particular, the modular symbols (2.9) are identified with elements in Ker(\u03b1):\n{g(0), g(i\u221e)}G \u2194 \u03b4s \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3(s) ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03b4s is the projector in C(P1 (R) \u00d7 P) given by the function equal to one on\nthe sheet P1 (R) \u00d7 {s} and zero elsewhere.\nVia the six terms exact sequence, the elements of Ker(\u03b1) can be identified with\n(the image of) elements in K0 (C(P1 (R) \u00d7 P) \u22ca \u0393). Thus, modular symbols, that is,\nhomology classes of certain geodesics in the bulk space correspond to (differences\nof) projectors in the algebra of observables on the boundary space.\n2.2.5. Modular forms. Finally, we discuss from this perspective some results of [ManMar], [Mar], which give a correspondence between certain classes of\nfunctions on the bulk space and on the boundary.\nAs the class of functions on the boundary, we consider functions\nl(f, \u03b2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nf (qk (\u03b2), qk\u22121 (\u03b2)).\n\n(2.12)\n\nk=1\n\nHere f is a complex valued function defined on pairs of coprime integers (q, q \u2032 ) with\nq \u2265 q \u2032 \u2265 1 and with f (q, q \u2032 ) = O(q \u2212\u01eb ) for some \u01eb > 0, and qk (\u03b2) are the successive\ndenominators of the continued fraction expansion of \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1]. The summing over\npairs of successive denominators is what replaces modularity, when \"pushed to the\nboundary\".\nWe consider the case of G = \u03930 (N ), and the function\nZ\nq + q\u2032\n\u2032\nf (q, q ) = 1+t n \u2032 o\n\u03c9,\n(2.13)\nq\n0, qq\n\u03930 (N )\n\n\u2217\nwith \u03c9 such that the pullback \u03c0G\n(\u03c9)/dz is an eigenform for all Hecke operators.\nConsider the corresponding l(f, \u03b2) defined as in (2.12). We have the following\nresult.\n\n2.2.6. Proposition. For almost all \u03b2, the series (2.12) for the function (2.13)\nconverges absolutely. Moreover, we have\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u221e\nX\nqn+1 (\u03b2) + qn (\u03b2)\nqn (\u03b2)\n(2.14)\nC(f, \u03b2) :=\n0,\n1+t\nq\n(\u03b2)\nq\n(\u03b2)\nn+1\nn+1\n\u0393\n(N)\n0\nn=1\nwhich defines, for almost all \u03b2 a homology class in H1 (XG , cusps, R) satisfying\nZ\nl(f, \u03b2) =\n\u03c9\n(2.15)\nC(f,\u03b2)\n\n\f27\n\nwith integral average\nZ\n\n[0,1]\n\n(N)\n\nl(f, \u03b2) d\u03b2 =\n\n\u03b6(1 + t)\nL\u03c9 (2 + t)\n\u2212 (N)\n\u03b6(2 + t) \u03b6 (2 + t)2\n\n!Z\n\ni\u221e\n\n\u03a6(z)dz,\n\n(2.16)\n\n0\n\n(N)\n\nwith L\u03c9 the Mellin transform of \u03a6 with omitted Euler N \u2013factor, and \u03b6(s) the\nRiemann zeta, with corresponding \u03b6 (N) .\nResults of this type can be regarded, on the one hand, as an explicit correspondence between a certain class of fields on the bulk space (Mellin transforms of\nmodular forms of weight two), and the class of fields (2.12) on the boundary. It\nalso provides classes (2.14) which correspond to certain configurations of geodesics\nin the bulk space. These can be interpreted completely in terms of the boundary.\nIn fact the results of Proposition 2.2.4 can be rephrased also in terms of cyclic\ncohomology (cf. [ManMar], [Nis]), so that the classes (2.14) in H1 (XG , cusps, R)\ncan be regarded as elements in the cyclic cohomology of the algebra (2.2). Thus,\nexpressions such as the right hand side of (2.16), which express arithmetic properties of the modular curve can be recast entirely in terms of a suitable field theory\non the boundary (2.2).\nReferences\n[AhGuMOO] O.
