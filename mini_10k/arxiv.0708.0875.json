Curioni, B. T. Fleming and M. Soderberg\nYale University\nAbstract. In this paper we give a concise description of a liquid argon time projection chamber\n(LAr TPC) developed at Yale, and present results from its first calibration run with cosmic rays.\nKeywords: liquid argon, TPC, neutrinos\nPACS: 13.15.+g, 29.40-n, 07.20.Mc\n\nINTRODUCTION\nLiquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPC) are nearly optimal detectors for\nneutrino experiments looking for \u03bde appearance on a \u03bd\u03bc beam in the energy range 0.5\n\u2013 5 GeV. The LAr TPC technology has been proposed for the measurement of \u03b813 , CP\nviolation in the neutrino sector and determination of the mass hierarchy (e.g. [1, 2, 3]),\nand to study the MiniBooNE low energy anomaly [4, 5]. The technique is equally\npromising for proton decay searches [6]. A LAr TPC for neutrino physics was first\nproposed in 1977 by Carlo Rubbia and a vigorous R&D program was then established,\nwhich produced decisive steps in defining the technology and its applicability to particle\nphysics (e.g. [7, 8, 9, 10]). Very remarkably, images taken in a LAr TPC are comparable\nin quality with pictures from bubble chambers. As for bubble chambers, events can\nbe analyzed reconstructing 3-momentum and particle type for each track in the event\nimage, down to low energy (few MeV for electrons, few tens of MeV for protons);\nthe calorimetric performance ranges from good to excellent, depending on event energy\nand topology. Equally important, the LAr TPC technology is suitable for very massive\n(several 10 ktons) detectors, as required in most contemporary neutrino physics. A very\nactive R&D program is on going in the U.S.; as part of this larger effort, a LAr TPC has\nbeen developed at Yale starting in 2005. The detector has been commissioned in early\n2007, and cosmic ray tracks have been imaged. Preliminary results are presented here.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DETECTOR\n1. Cryogenics: the LAr TPC is housed in a cylindrical stainless steel vessel of total\nvolume 500 l. The inside walls are electropolished. The vessel is evacuated to few\n10\u22126 mbar (at LAr temperature, 87 K) prior to filling with ultra pure LAr. The\nvessel is cooled to LAr temperature by an open bath filled with commercial, nonpurified LAr. It takes about five hours to cool down the system and fill it until the\nTPC is fully covered (about 250 l of ultra-pure LAr). The total LAr consumption is\n\u223c 1,000 l for a 24 hr long experiment. The top flange of the TPC vessel (Fig. 1-le f t)\nhouses several ports: feedthroughs for the TPC high-voltage, signal cables, test\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Left: the top flange, described in the text; Right: the TPC, fully cabled, hanging from the\ntop flange.\n\npulse and capacitive level meter, high voltage feedthrough and optical feedthrough\nfor a purity monitor mounted inside the vessel, pumping line, filling line, relief\nvalve, pressure gauges, and a window. All the seals are CF or VCR. The top flange\nitself is sealed using a Viton O-ring, therefore the system is not designed to be\nvacuum-tight at LAr temperature in steady state. The adopted filling procedure is\nto break the vacuum using ultra-pure cold Ar gas while the LAr open bath is about\nhalf full. In steady state the system runs at an overpressure of 0.3 atm. The relief\nvalve has been provided by H. Jostlein of FNAL.\n2. Liquid Ar purification: the necessity to drift free electrons in LAr for O(1 millisecond) or longer sets very stringent requirements on the purity of LAr, at the level of\nseveral tens of parts per trillion of O2 -equivalent contamination (cf. few parts per\nmillion in commercially available LAr). The filters to purify LAr have been developed and built at FNAL and are described in [11]; a detailed paper is in preparation.\nThe filter itself is made of a copper alumina catalyst 1 , packaged in a CF nipple with\nsinterized steel caps. The filter is regenerated in place at Yale. Commercial grade\nLAr is purified with a single pass through the filter, without any additional molecular sieve, at a rate of \u223c60 l/hr. To measure the electron lifetime independently of the\nTPC operation, a purity monitor (see [10], and provided by the FNAL group) was\nmounted underneath the TPC. A loss of drifting charge due to attachment to impurities of less than 10% over a drift time of 0.5 ms has been repeatedly measured in\nthe TPC vessel, stable over a period of 24 hours without recirculation.\n3. TPC and Electronics: the fiducial volume of the LAr TPC (Fig. 1-right) is a\ncylinder of 33 cm diameter and 17 cm tall. The field cage is made of 6 hollow\nstainless steel rings, separated by Teflon spacers, and connected through a chain of\n100 M\u03a9 resistors. There are two parallel readout wire planes, with 50 wires each\n1\n\nEngelhard Copper Alumina catalyst CU-0226S\n\n\fand a wire pitch of 5 mm. Flat cables are soldered to the wire planes and reach the\nreadout electronics through a signal feedthrough (INFN-Padova / ICARUS), which\nholds 512 channels. The readout electronics is the same as the ICARUS one and\nhas been provided by the INFN-Padova / ICARUS group [10].\n\nRESULTS\nThe LAr TPC has been tested on the readily available cosmic rays. During data taking\nthe electric field in the drift region was 100 V/cm, and 250 V/cm between the induction\nand the collection planes. The signals from the induction plane were rather noisy due to\ncapacitive coupling with the high voltage in the drift region, and are not presented here.\nThe data acquisition was triggered on the sum coincidence of one board (25 channels) of\nthe collection plane. Some events recorded during a cosmic ray run are shown in Fig. 2\nand 3. The signal is well visible over noise on each of the hit wires. The drift velocity in\nLAr at 100 V/cm is 0.5 mm/\u03bc s, with a maximum drift time of 340 \u03bc s.\n\nFIGURE 2. Two raw images of muons crossing the TPC, displayed as wire number vs. drift time\n[0.4 \u03bc s]. In both cases the zoomed image is also shown; the superimposed squares show the hit position\ndetermined by an automated fit of the waveform. The bottom panels show two waveforms, with the fit\nsuperimposed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA prototype LAr TPC has been designed, built and tested at Yale over a period of\ntwo years. It has been developed as a handy R&D tool for the university setting, with\nthe possibility of repeated runs over a short period of time. The LAr purification is a\nrecent development, applied for the first time to a working imaging instrument, while\nthe readout electronics has been provided by the ICARUS collaboration. The success in\n\n\fFIGURE 3.\n\nRaw image of an e.m. shower, displayed as drift time [0.4 \u03bc s] vs. wire number.\n\nimaging cosmic rays marks an important milestone in terms of technology transfer for\nthe US LAr TPC effort.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank all the people who contributed to this project.
