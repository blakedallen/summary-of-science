Nicastro1,2,3 , Y. Krongold4 , D. Fields5 , M.L. Conciatore3 , L. Zappacosta3 , M. Elvis3 , S.\nMathur6 , I. Papadakis7\nABSTRACT\nWe present a possible OVIII X-ray absorption line at z = 0.117 \u00b1 0.001\nwhich, if confirmed, will be the first one associated with a broad HI Ly\u03b2 (BLB:\n\u22121\nFWHM=160+50\n\u221230 km s ) absorber. The absorber lies along the line of sight to\nthe nearby (z = 0.1372) Seyfert 1 galaxy PKS 0558-504, consistent with being a\nWHIM filament. The X-ray absorber is marginally detected in two independent\nXMM-Newton spectra of PKS 0558-504, a long \u223c 600 ks Guest-Observer observation and a shorter, \u223c 300 ks total, calibration observation, with a combined\nsingle line statistical significance of 2.8\u03c3 (2.7\u03c3 and 1.2\u03c3 in the two spectra, respectively). When fitted with our self-consistent hybrid-photoionization WHIM\nmodels, the combined XMM-Newton spectrum is consistent with the presence\nof OVIII K\u03b1 at z = (0.117 \u00b1 0.001). This model gives best fitting temperature and equivalent H column density of the absorber of logT = 6.56+0.19\n\u22120.17 K,\n\u22121\n\u22122\nand logNH = (21.5 \u00b1 0.3)(Z/Z0.01\u2299) cm , and predicts the marginal contribution of only two more lines within the XMM-Newton RGS band pass, NeIX K\u03b1\n(\u03bb = 13.45 \u00c5) and FeXVII L (\u03bb = 15.02 \u00c5), both with equivalent widths well\nwithin the 1\u03c3 sensitivity of the combined XMM-Newton spectrum of PKS 0558504 (EW1\u03c3 < 3 m\u00c5). The lack of detection of associated OVI in the archival\nFUSE spectrum of PKS 0558-504, allows us to infer a tighter lower limit on the\ntemperature, of logT > 6.52 K (at 1\u03c3).\n1\n\nOsservatorio Astronomico di Roma - INAF, Via di Frascati 33, 00040, Monte Porzio Catone, RM, Italy\n\n2\n\nIESL, Foundation for Research and Technology, 711 10, Heraklion, Crete (Greece)\n\n3\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden st., Cambridge, MA 02138, USA\n\n4\n\nInstituto de Astronomia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City (Mexico)\n\n5\n\nL.A.

Box 2208, GR-710 03 Heraklion, Crete (Greece)\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nThe statistical sigificance of this single X-ray detection is increased by the\ndetection of broad and complex HI Ly\u03b2 absorption in archival FUSE spectra\nof PKS 0558-504, at redshifts z = 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001 consistent with the bestfitting redshift of the X-ray absorber. The FUSE spectrum shows a broad\n\u22121\n(FWHM= 160+50\n\u221230 km s ) absorption complex, which we identify as HI Ly\u03b2\nzBLB = (0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001). The single line statistical significance of this line is\n4.1\u03c3 (3.7\u03c3 if systematics are considered). A possible HI Ly\u03b1 is marginally hinted\nin an archival low-resolution (\u2206\u03bb \u223c 6 \u00c5) IUE spectrum of PKS 0558-504, at a\nredshift of z = (0.119 \u00b1 0.001) and with single line significance of 1.7\u03c3. Thus, the\ncombined significance of the three (XMM-Newton, FUSE, and IUE) independent\ntenative detections, is 5.2\u03c3 (5.0\u03c3 if the HI Ly\u03b1 is not considered, and 4.6\u03c3 if the\nsystematics in FUSE are considered).\nThe detection of both metal and H lines at a consistent redshift, in this hot\nabsorbing system, allows us to speculate on its metallicity. By associating the\nbulk of the X-ray absorber with the BLB line detected in the FUSE spectrum at\nzBLB = 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001, we obtain a metallicity of 1-4% Solar.\nAlthough the absorber is only blueshifted by \u223c \u22126000 km s\u22121 from the systemic redshift of PKS 0558-504, the identification of the absorbing gas with a\nhigh velocity nuclear ionized outflow, is unlikely. The physical, chemical and\ndynamical properties of the detected absorber are all quite different from those\ntypically found in the Warm Absorber (WA) outflows, commonly detected in\nSeyferts and higher luminosity quasars. WA outflow velocities typically span a\nrange of few hundreds to \u223c 1 \u2212 2 thousands km s\u22121 ; WA metallicities, when\nmeasured, are typically found to be at least Solar; high-ionization WAs are virtually always found to co-exist with lower-ionization X-ray and UV phases. All\nthis strongly suggests that the absorber, if confirmed, is an intervening WHIM\nsystem.\nSubject headings: WHIM, Absorption Lines\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the present epoch (z< 1 \u2212 2), over half (54 %, Fukugita, 2003) of the baryons are\nmissing. They are predicted by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (e.g. Kirkman et al., 2003),\ninferred by density fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwawe Background (e.g. Bennet et al.,\n2003; Spergel et al., 2007), and seen at z \u223c 3 in the \"Ly\u03b1 Forest\" (e.g. Rauch, 1998; Weinberg\net al., 1997), but by z < 2 they are unaccounted for in detected stars and gas (Fukugita,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2003). According to hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of structures in a \u039b-CDM\nUniverse (e.g. Cen & Ostriker, 2006), most, if not all, of these missing baryons should be\nin a barely visible \"warm-hot\" phase of the filamentary intergalactic medium (the WHIM).\nThe WHIM was shock-heated to temperatures of 105 \u2212107 K during the continued process of\ncollapse and structure formation, and enriched up to ZW HIM = 0.1 \u2212 1 Z\u2299 by galaxy superwinds (GSW, Cen & Ostriker, 2006). These GSWs efficiently removed metals from the cool\nand dense ISM phase in galaxies and spread them into the tenuous (ne \u223c 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22124 cm\u22123 ,\ni.e. overdensities \u03b4 \u223c 5\u2212500 compared to the average density of the Universe) WHIM phase,\nenriching the gas to few percent, and up to tens of percent, of the solar metallicity values\n(e.g. Cen & Ostriker, 2006). WHIM filaments are too tenuous to be detected through their\nbremsstrahlung and line emission with current X-ray instruments (e.g. Yoshikawa et al.,\n2003). However, integrated column densities of high-ionization metal ions along a random\nsection of one of these filaments could reach values as high as \u223c 1016 cm\u22122 (OVII in the soft\nX-Rays) and \u223c 1014 cm\u22122 (OVI in the Far-Ultraviolet: FUV), imprinting metal absorption\nlines in the FUV and soft X-ray spectra of background sources with equivalent width ranging\nbetween EW \u223c 1\u221220 m\u00c5 (the OVII K\u03b1 in the X-rays) and EW\u223c 10\u2212100 m\u00c5 (the \u03bb \u2243 1032\n\u00c5 transition, inthe FUV).\nThe most intense of these absorption lines are the OVI1s2 2s\u21921s2 2p doublet in the UV\n(\u03bb = 1031.926, 1037.617 \u00c5), and the CV K\u03b1(r) (\u03bb = 40.268 \u00c5), OVII K\u03b1(r) (\u03bb = 21.602 \u00c5),\nCVI Ly\u03b1 (\u03bb = 33.74 \u00c5) and OVIII Ly\u03b1 (\u03bb = 18.97 \u00c5), in the X-ray band. Which of these\nlines dominates, depends on the ionization state of the gas, that is mainly on its temperature\n(and at a second order on the gas volume density). Dav\u00e9 and collaborators (2001) showed\nthat the baryon temperature distribution in the intergalactic space, peaks at logT \u223c 6.6 K,\nand is strongly skewed toward low temperatures: 50% of the baryon in the WHIM are found\nbetween logT = 5.6 K and logT = 6.7 K at a weighted average temperature of logT = 5.9\nK, while the low (logT = (5 \u2212 5.6) K) and high (logT= (6.6 \u2212 7) K) temperature tails of\nthe WHIM temperature distribution, contain 27% and 23% of the gaseous baryons in the\nUniverse, respectively, around weighted average teperatures of logT = 5.4 K and logT = 6.7\n(Conciatore et al., in preparation). So, while the vast majority (73%) of the baryons in\nthe WHIM should absorb and emit in the X-rays at the wavelengths of the He-like (50%)\nand/or H-like (23%) ions of C and O, a substantial fraction of the WHIM (27%) should be\ndetectable in the FUV, through Li-like C and O transitions.\nThese theoretical predictions have been confirmed by FUV observations (e.g. Danforth\n& Shull, 2005, 2008; Tripp et al., 2008; Richther, 2006). Danforth & Shull (2005) analyzed\nFUSE data of 31 AGNs with z < 0.15 to search for OVI absorption counterparts to 129\nknown Ly\u03b1 absorbers. They found 40 such systems, deriving a dNOV I /dz(\u2265 EWT hresh )\nthat agrees strikingly with the latest predictions by Cen & Fang (2006; see their Fig. 2).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nHowever, as pointed out recently by Tripp et al. (2008), the vast majority of the associated\nHI Ly\u03b1 absorption lines are too narrow to be produced in gas with typical WHIM temperatures. Danforth & Shull (2008) proposed that low-ionization metals and narrow HI Ly\u03b1\ntrace mildly photoionized medium (the low-z Ly\u03b1 Forest: \u223c 30% of the baryons), while\nnarrow-HI/OVI/NV associations trace a multiphase intergalactic medium, with a photoionized portion of the intervening filament imprinting the narrow-HI absorption and a shockheated part (WHIM) imprinting the OVI/NV on the UV spectra (\u223c 10% of the baryons).\nI\n\u22122\nDanforth & Shull (2008) estimate \u03a9OV\nW HIM = 0.34 % (down to logNOV I > 13.4 cm ). This\nis \u223c 15 % of the \"missing mass\" (strictly speaking, only a lower limit, given the large uncertainties in the ionization correction for the OVI-bearing gas), in good agreement with\nthe WHIM baryon fraction predicted to reside in the low-temperature tail of the WHIM\nmass-temperature distribution.\nDetecting the bulk of the 'Missing Baryons' in the \"X-Ray Forest\", instead, has proven\nto be extremely difficult. This is because of the unfortunate combination of (a) the still\nlimited resolution (R \u223c 400 at \u03bb = 21.6 \u00c5) and the low throughput (AEf f \u223c 20 \u2212 40 cm2 )\nof the current high-resolution X-ray spectrometers [the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating\nSpectrometer (RGS, den Herder, et al. 2001) and the Chandra Low Energy Transmission\nGrating (LETG: Brinkman et al., 2000)]; (b) the lack of bright (f0.5\u22122keV \u2265 10\u221211 erg s\u22121\ncm\u22122 ) extragalactic point-like targets (e.g. Conciatore et al., in preparation); and, (c) the\ndramatic steepening (\u2206\u03b1 >\u223c 1.5) of the predicted number density of metal WHIM filaments\nper unit redshift at ion column densities >\u223c 1015 cm\u22122 .\nCurrent evidence is still limited, and highly controversial: in 2005, Nicastro et al.\n(2005a,b) reported the first two \u2265 3\u03c3 detections of absorption systems identifiable with\nWHIM filaments, at z = 0.011 and z = 0.027, towards the blazar Mkn 421, which was in\noutburst. One of these two systems is at a redshift consistent with that of a known intervening HI Ly\u03b1 absorber (Shull, Stocke & Penton, 1996) that line, however, is too narrow, and so\nthe absorbing gas too cold, to be physically associated with the X-ray metal filament. This\nclaim has been questioned in two subsequent papers by Kaastra et al. (2006) and Rasmussen\net al. (2007), based on: (a) apparent wavelength inconsistencies for some of the lines, which\ncalled into question their association with a given WHIM system; (b) statistical arguments\nfor a significantly lower detection significance for the WHIM identifications than originally\nreported by Nicastro et al. (2005a,b); and (c) the lack of detection of these two systems in\nXMM-Newton RGS calibration spectra of Mkn 421 (but see also Nicastro, Mathur & Elvis,\n2008, for rebuttal arguments). Fang, Canizares & Yao (2007) proposed the detection of an\nOVIII WHIM filament along the line of sight to the blazar PKS 2155-304, once again near\nthe redshift of a known narrow HI Ly\u03b1 absorber not due to the same gas as the putative\nX-ray filament, because of the line width. The above reported pieces of evidence for the exis-\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntence of an \"X-ray Forest\" at low redshift, have been gathered by exploiting the technique of\nobserving random lines of sight toward the brightest possible X-ray sources, with exposures\nlong enough to reach extremely high S/N spectra. This technique has the advantage of not\nbeing biased toward the strongest WHIM systems, and so allows probes of the bulk of the\nWHIM mass distribution. However, the WHIM is predicted, and in the FUV has most likely\nbeen found (e.g. Stocke et al., 2006b), to correlate strongly with galaxy concentrations in\nthe Universe: the densest of such concentrations are also supposed to host the nodes, and\nso the densest and hottest parts, of the WHIM network.\nAn alternative technique, therefore, is to target the WHIM search in the X-rays along\nthose lines of sight toward bright background X-ray sources that intercept large scale structure concentrations. By exploiting this technique Buote et al. (2009), reported a \u223c 3\u03c3\ndetection of a high column density (NOV II \u2265 1016 cm\u22122 ) OVII K\u03b1 absorption line, along the\nline of sight to the blazar H 2356-309, at the redshift of a very large concentration of galaxies in the Sculptor Wall. This technique has the disadvantage of probing only the extreme\nhigh-temperature/density and low-mass fraction ends (\u223c 23%) of the WHIM distribution.\nAll the above proposed WHIM detections so far, suffer the serious handicap of lacking\nthe detection of a clearly associated HI counterpart. The detection of broad HI Lyman lines\n(mostly Ly\u03b1 at \u03bb = 1215.67 \u00c5 - BLA - and Ly\u03b2 at \u03bb = 1025.72 \u00c5 - BLB) is vital for a\nproper assessment of the WHIM metallicity and mass, and require the use of both X-ray and\nFUV facilities. Without HI, metallicity cannot be determined and so a cosmological mass\nHIM\ndensity \u03a9W\ncannot be derived.\nb\nThe expected thermal FWHM of an absortion line \u221a\nimprinted from a gas of particles of mass\nm at the equilibrium temperature T , is given by 2 2ln2 times\nvariance of the velocity\n\u221a the p\ndistribution (the Doppler parameter b), that is FWHM= 2 2ln2 kT /m. For HI, this\nimplies a broadening of FWHM\u223c 380 km s\u22121 at logT = 6.5 1 .\nThe HI fraction, relative to the total H, in gas with temperatures in the logT = (5.8 \u2212 6.3)\nrange (where 50% of the WHIM should be, e.g. Dav\u00e9 et al., 2001), spans the interval\n10\u22126.2 \u2212 10\u22127.2 . Thus only very shallow (EW(Ly\u03b1 \u2243 8 \u2212 80 m\u00c5) and broad HI absorption\nlines are expected to be imprinted onto FUV spectra by WHIM filaments, requiring spectra\nwith S/N\u2243 10 \u2212 100 per resolution element to make them detectable.\nHere we present the first tentative detection of a hot (X-ray) WHIM filament along the\nline of sight to the z = 0.1372 Seyfert galaxy PKS 0558-504, that is physically associated with\n1\n\nFor heavier elements, the width scales with the inverse of the root square of the atomic weight. So, for\nexample, for O, Ne and Fe, at logT = 6.5, FWHM=95, 85 and 51 km s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\na BLA HI absorber. A full band analysis of the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of PKS 0558504, is deferred to a companion paper (Papadakis et al., 2009, submitted). In \u00a72 we present\nthe XMM-Newton, FUSE and IUE data that we use in our analysis. \u00a73 and 4 are dedicated\nto the X-ray and FUV data reduction and analysis. In \u00a75 we critically discuss our findings,\nand in \u00a76 we summarize our conclusions.\n2.\n\nXMM-Newton, FUSE and IUE Data of PKS 0558-504\n\nBetween February 2000 and October 2001, PKS 0558-504 was the subject of an extensive\ncalibration campaign with XMM-Newton, with a total expsoure of 312 ksec (hereinafter 'CAL\nspectrum'). More recently, in September 2008, PKS 0558-504 was re-observed by the XMMNewton for 618 ksec, as part of an approved cycle 8 Guest Observer program (PI. S. Papdakis;\nhereinafter 'GO spectrum'). In this work we make use of the RGS spectra extracted from\nboth data sets. We focus mostly on the analysis of the longer and much higher S/N 2008 (16\nvs 9, at 25 \u00c5) GO spectrum. We use the lower S/N 2000-2001 CAL spectrum for consistency\nchecks.\nPKS 0558-504 was observed by the FUSE satellite twice: on 1999, December 10 and\n2001, November 7, with net exposure times of 47.2 ksec and 48.3 ksec, respectively. In our\nanalysis we co-add the two spectra from the Lif2A channel (with the highest efficiency in the\n1100-1200 \u00c5 interval) to maximize the S/N and perform our search for intervening BLAs\nand BLBs in this co-added FUSE spectrum 2 .\nFinally, PKS 0558-504 has been observed three times with the 'Short-Wavelength' spectrometer of the IUE satellites (the only one covering the wavelength range of interest), on\n1987, September 22, and 1989, November 14-15. In our analysis we use the highest S/N of\nthe three spectra (with a net exposure time of 16.2 ksec), the one taken on 1989, November\n15, and check the other two spectra for consistency.\nTable 1 lists the journal of the XMM-Newton, FUSE and IUE observations used in this\nwork. For all our spectral fitting we use the fitting package Sherpa, of the Chandra Interactive\nAnalysis of Observation (Ciao) software (v. 4.1.2; Freeman, Doe & Siemiginowska, 2001).\n2\n\nWe also reduced and analyzed the sum of the two spectra from the Lif1B channel, which is sensitive\n(though with about half of the effective area of the Lif2A channel) in a wavelength interval similar to that\nof the Lif2A. However, the Lif1B channel is unreliable at >\n\u223c 1140 \u00c5 (The FUSE Data Handbook, Chapter 7,\n\u00a77.3.2, http://archive.stsci.edu/fuse/DH Final/Factors Affecting FUSE Data.html), which is the region of\ninterest for our analysis. Therefore we decided to consider only the Lif2A channel in our analysis (but see\nalso footnote 9, \u00a74).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nThe RGS Spectrum of PKS 0558-504\nRGS Data Reduction and Analysis\n\nThe 2008 GO RGS data of PKS 0558-504 were reduced as in Papadakis et al. (2009),\nand the same standard reduction procedure was applied to the 2000-2001 calibration observations of this target. The data were cleaned for periods of high background activity, by\nexcluding events taken within time-intervals where the background deviated positively by its\naverage level by more than 2\u03c3. Finally RGS1 and RGS2 spectra and responses of the single\nobservations of the two datasets (CAL and GO) were co-added and averaged by using the\nrgscombine tool. This produced total net exposures of 480 ksec (RGS1) and 466 ksec (RGS2),\nfor the GO dataset, and 309 ksec (RGS1) and 283 ksec (RGS2) for the CAL dataset. Despite\na 30% higher average flux level of PKS 0558-504 during the CAL observations, compared\nto the GO observations, and a relatively small difference of only 65% in the net exposure\ntimes of the two datasets, the S/N of the GO spectra is significantly (factor of \u223c 2) higher\nthan that of the CAL spectra. In half RGS resolution element (30 m\u00c5), at 0.5 keV the\nco-added RGS1 CAL spectrum has S/N=9, compared with S/N=16 for the GO spectrum.\nThis difference in S/N is due to the much higher (more than an order of magnitude) level\nof the average background during all individual CAL observations, compared with the GO\nobservations. This is clearly seen in Figure 1, where we plot the combined GO RGS1 20-24\n\u00c5 background-subtracted source (green filled circles and errorbars) and background (blue\nfilled circles and errorbars) spectra of PKS 0558-504, together with the combined CAL RGS1\n20-24 \u00c5 background-subtracted source (black empty squares and errorbars) and background\n(red empty squares and errorbars) spectra of PKS 0558-504. We therefore decided not to\nfurther combine the RGS spectra of the two datasets, and to analyze them separately and\nsimultaneously.\nIn our spectral analysis we bin the RGS spectra two 45 m\u00c5 bin (about half the nominal\nFWHM resolution of the RGSs).\n\n3.2.\n\nX-Ray Spectral Fitting\n\nIn our companion paper (Papadakis et al., 2009), we present the broad-band 0.4-2 keV\nspectral analysis of the 2008 RGS spectra of PKS 0558-504, and show that the soft X-ray\ncontinuum of PKS 0558-504 is well modeled by a broken power law with a break energy\nof Ebrk \u223c 1.5 keV, attenuated by Galactic ISM absorption. More importantly we exclude\nthe presence of a Warm Absorber with typical column densities and ionization parameters\n(Papdakis et al., 2009). This is consistent with the absence of associated, intrinsic, Narrow\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nAbsorption Lines (NALs) in the Far Ultraviolet spectrum of PKS 0558-504 (Dunn et al.,\n2007). However, Papadakis et al. (2009) also note that weak absorption line-like features\nare detected in the spectrum of PKS 0558-504, in the narrow 20-24 \u00c5 spectral interval. These\nthree lines, and in particular the line at \u03bb = 21.18 \u00c5 are the subject of this study.\nWe first explored the 20-24 \u00c5 region of the GO and CAL RGS1 spectra of PKS 0558-504\n(the RGS2 is blind in this wavelength range, due to the lack of a read-out CCD chip). We\nfitted the data simultaneously, with two local continuum models, each including a power law\nattenuated by neutral absorption with the metallicity set to Anders & Grevesse (1989). While\nsuch a model gives a statistically acceptable fit for the GO spectrum of PKS 0558-504, it\nleaves broad and systematic residuals in the CAL spectrum. This is because the rgscombineaveraged CAL response matrix fails to properly reproduce the depth of the several effective\narea features present in this portion of the RGS1 spectrum. We therefore added a number of\nFWHM\u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 \u00c5 broad emission and absorption gaussians to the best fitting continuum\nmodel of the CAL spectrum of PKS 0558-504, until we reached a statistically acceptable\nfit. Three narrow regions with a deficit of counts are left in the GO and CAL residuals to\nthe best fitting continuum models, at \u03bb \u223c 23.5 \u00c5, \u03bb \u223c 21.6 \u00c5 and \u03bb \u223c 21.2 \u00c5. To model\nthese residuals we added three Gaussians to our best-fitting continuum models and refitted\nthe data leaving all Gaussians parameters free to vary independently in the fit to the GO\nspectrum, but linking the line energies and Gaussian widths in fitting the CAL spectrum to\nthose of the corresponding parameters of the fitting model of the GO spectrum. The first\nthree rows of Table 2 show the best fitting parameters of these three absorption lines. Errors\non wavelengths and redshifts are assumed to be equal to 1 bin-size, 30 m\u00c5, if unresolved by\nthe fitting routine). Figure 2 shows the 20-24 \u00c5 RGS1 CAL and GO data of PKS 0558-504,\nwith their best-fitting models superimposed. The first two of these lines, at \u03bb = 23.52 \u00b1 0.03\n\u00c5 and \u03bb = 21.61\u00b10.03 \u00c5, are easily identified with the K\u03b1 inner shell transition from atomic\nOI in the Interstellar Medium of the Galaxy, and the K\u03b1 He-like transition from OVII either\nin our Galaxy halo or in the Local group (e.g. Bregman et al., 2007 and references therein).\nThe third line, at \u03bb = 21.17 \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5, appears marginally resolved (but still consistent with\nan unresolved Gaussian at a 1\u03c3 confidence level 3 ) in the RGS1 (FWHM <\u223c 1200 km s\u22121 :\nTable 2) and has no obvious identification with transitions at z \u2243 0. If red-shifted to the\nsystemic redshift of PKS 0558-504 (z = 0.1372, REFs), this line would have a rest-frame\nwavelength of \u03bb = 18.62 \u00c5, close to the rest-frame wavelength of the OVII K\u03b2 transition.\n3\n\nthe projection routine in Sherpa, which we use here to compute uncertainties and upper limits, finds only\nan upper limit for the line FWHM, at a 1\u03c3 confidence level. This is because of the high non-gaussianeity\nof the RGS Line Spread Function (e.g. Williams et al., 2005), which makes the effective LSF FWHM\nsignificantly broader than the nominal Gaussian equivalent LSF FWHM of 60 m\u00c5(corresponding to \u223c 900\nkm s\u22121 at 21.2 \u00c5).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nHowever, in this case, a much stronger (factor \u223c 6.4) OVII K\u03b1 line 4 with EW\u223c 60 m\u00c5\nshould be visible at \u03bb = 24.55 \u00c5. Such a line is not seen in the data (see also Papadakis et\nal., 2009) at a 3\u03c3 limit of EW< 18 m\u00c55 . Moreover, the absence of intrinsic OVI absoprtion\nin the FUSE data of PKS 0558-504 (Dunn et al., 2007), makes this interpretation less likely.\nThe next possible identification is with an intervening absorber, between the redshift of\nPKS 0558-504 and us. This imposes the condition that the line has a rest-frame wavelength\nin the 18.6-21.2 \u00c5 spectral interval. The strongest resonant absorption line expected in\nthis spectral range is the OVIII Ly\u03b1 transition, with an unresolved doublet at an oscillator\nstrength weighted average wavelength < \u03bb >= 18.97 \u00c5. This would give a redshift of z =\n0.116 \u00b1 0.002 for the intervening absorber.\n3.3.\n\nConsistency Test with a Self-Consistent WHIM Spectral Model\n\nTo check whether the presence of an OVIIIK\u03b1 WHIM filament at z = 0.116 \u00b1 0.002\nalong the line of sight to PKS 0558-504, is consistent with the full band XMM-Newton RGS\nspectra of this target, we used our hybrid ionization (collisional + photoionization by the\nmeta-galactic UV and X-ray background at a given redshift) WHIM spectral models (an evolution of our PHotoinized Absorber Spectral Engine - \"PHASE\" -, Krongold et al., 2003), to\nsimultaneously fit the RGS1 and RGS2 Cal and GO data of PKS 0558-504. The fitting model\nincludes our best-fitting continuum model (a combination of power-laws and broad gaussians\nto cure residual calibration uncertainties), two negative gaussians to model the OIK\u03b1 and\nOVIIK\u03b1 absorptions at z \u2243 0, and a WHIM model. In the X-ray band alone one cannot\nconstrain the absolute metallicity of the absorber (for which detection of HI is needed), since\nthe ionization balance of an hybridly ionized cloud of gas (i.e. the fractional ion abundances),\nparameterized by the temperature of the absorber, at equilibrium, is virtually independent\non metallicity (see also \u00a75.2). Thus, for fitting purposes only, we froze the WHIM metallicity\nto Solar. The turbulent velocity of the absorber was frozen to 400 km s\u22121 (about 1/2 of\nthe RGS FWHM resolution at 22 \u00c5). In a hybrid-ionization WHIM model, photoionization\nby the meta-galactic UV and X-ray photon field, is only a secondary ionization mechanism,\nand its realtive importance, compared to the collisional shock mechanism, depends only on\n4\n5\n\ntogether with several other strong lines from He- and H-like ions of C, N and Ne\n\nwe also caution, however, that although the RGS1 spectra of PKS 0558-504 are free of instrumental\nfeature at, exactly, 24.55 \u00c5, this spectral region of the RGS1 contains several instrumental features, which\nmight reduce, due to calibration uncertainties, the true sensitivity of the RGS1 spectrum at 24.55 \u00c5. See\nalso \u00a75.2\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nthe volume density of the WHIM filament: the lower the density the more important the\nphotoionization contribution. In such models the absorber density is thus highly degenerate with the absorber temperature and equivalent H column density, and so is difficult to\nconstrain. We therefore froze the density of the absorbing gas to a typical expected WHIM\nvalue of nb = 10\u22125 cm\u22123 (overdensity \u03b4 \u2243 50 compared to the average baryon density in the\nUniverse), corresponding to an ionization parameter (the ratio between the photon density\nat the surface of the absorbing cloud and the baryon density in the cloud) of logU = \u22121.9\nat z = 0.1. At such densities (and higher), the photoionization contribution is essentially\nnegligible, and the model reduces to a pure collisional ionization model. The remaining\nWHIM parameters, namely the gas temperature and equivalent hydrogen column density,\nand the redshift of the WHIM filament, were left free to vary in the fit. The best-fitting\nWHIM model (Fig. 3, black curve) has logT = 6.56+0.19\n\u22120.17 , logNH = 19.5 \u00b1 0.3 (for Z = Z\u2299 )\nand z = 0.117 \u00b1 0.001. This model fits the most prominent OVIII K\u03b1 line at z = 0.117, and\npredicts only two additional weak absorption lines (EW <\u223c 1 mA): the NeX K\u03b1, at \u03bb = 15.02\n\u00c5 (WHIM filament frame) and a strong (oscillator strength 2.95) FeXVII L line at \u03bb = 16.77\n\u00c5(Fig. 3, black curve).\nFigure 4, 5 and 6 shows the two portions of the RGS CAL and GO spectra of PKS 0558504, in which the lines predicted by the best-fitting WHIM model lie. The superimposed\nred curve is the best fitting WHIM model convolved with the instrumental responses. The\nOVIII K\u03b1 line is detected both in the CAL and GO spectra (Fig. 4). The position of the\npredicted NeIX K\u03b1 and FeXVII L lines is marked in Fig. 5 (RGS1 and RGS2 GO spectra of\nPKS 0558-504) and Fig. 6 (RGS1 ands RGS2 CAL spectra of PKS 0558-504): the strength\nof these lines is < 1/3 the minimum detectable 1\u03c3 EW in the combined CAL+GO spectrum\n(Table 2). We note the hint of the presence of the FeXVII L line at 16.77 \u00c5 in both the RGS1\nGO (Fig. 5, top panel) and RGS2 CAL (Fig. 6, bottom panel) spectra of PKS 0558-504.\nIn Figure 3 we plot the best fitting WHIM model (central, black curve) together with its\nnegative (lower, red curve) and positive (upper, blue curve) 1\u03c3 temperatures. Both lower and\nupper limits on the temperature are weak. The strongest X-ray lower limit diagnostics in the\nmodel is the increasing strength of OVII K series absorption lines. However, the sensitivity\nof the RGS1 GO and CAL spectra of PKS 0558-504 at the wavelength of the strongest line\nof this series (the OVII K\u03b1 line) is dramatically reduced by the presence of an instrumental\nfeature due to a bad pixel in the read out dispersion detectors. On the other end, at higher\ntemperature, the limit is set by the decrease of opacity at the wavelengths of the OVIII\nK\u03b1 transitions, which is only detected at a combined single-line significance level of 2.8\u03c3 in\nthe data. This can be also seen in Figure 7, where we show the 68%, 90% and 95% logT\n- logNH contours of the best-fitting WHIM model. The parameters are clearly correlated\nand the temperature poorly constrained both at low and high temperatures. However, low\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ntemperatures and high column densities are excluded at high confidence levels.\n\n4.\n\nThe FUSE and IUE Spectra of PKS 0558-504\n\nWe searched the The Multimission Archive at STscI (MAST) archive 6 for FAR-UV\ndata of PKS 0558-504 and found several data sets, taken with FUSE, HST and IUE satellites\n(Table 1). Our main goal was to search for HI (Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2) and OVI absorption either\nat or near the systemic redshift of PKS 0558-504, or at a redshift consistent with that of\nthe putative X-ray WHIM filament, tentatively detected in the RGS spectrum of PKS 0558504. The available archival HST spectrum of PKS 0558-504 was taken with the STIS-G230\ngratings, and so covers a wavelength interval (\u03bb = 2760 \u2212 2910 \u00c5) not relevant to this\nanalysis. The FUSE and IUE spectra, instead, cover two important regions: (a) the HI Ly\u03b2\nand OVI regions (FUSE) and (b) the HI Ly\u03b1 region (IUE). We retrieved these data sets\nfrom the MAST archive, and analyzed them to search for a secure identification of the X-ray\nabsorber.\nFUSE observed PKS 0558-504 twice, in two different programs (P101, Sembach 1999,\nand C149, Prochaska 2002). All FUSE observations after the end of operations were rereduced using the final version of the CalFUSE pipeline (v3.2.3, Dixon et al., 2007), and we\nused the resultant science calibrated files. We used specific IRAF scripts 7 to co-add the\ndata from the Lif 2A channel, which covers the wavelength range 1087-1181 \u00c5, with a total\nexposure time of 90.3 ks. The spectrum was then binned to two different resolutions: the\nnatural resolution of FUSE (3 bins; 11 km/s) and a poorer resolution (20 bins; 70 km/sec)\nwith higher S/N per bin, specifically to search for broad, shallow absorption features.\nWe use the fitting package Sherpa in Ciao (v. 4.1.2; Freeman, Doe & Siemiginowska,\n2001), to search the FUSE spectrum for: (a) AGN intrinsic absorption between -1000 and\n+1000 km s\u22121 of the systemic redshift of PKS 0558-504; (b) intervening absorption at a\nredshift consistent with that of the putative X-ray WHIM filament. Specifically, for each\nof the two possible systems, we searched for absorption lines from: (1) the NIII triplet at\n\u03bb = 989.80 \u00c5, \u03bb = 991.51 \u00c5, and \u03bb = 991.57 \u00c5; (2) the OVI doublet at \u03bb = 1031.93 \u00c5\nand \u03bb = 1037.62 \u00c5; and (3) the HI Ly\u03b2, at \u03bb = 1025.72 \u00c5. We confirm the non-detection\nof intrinsic (i.e. nuclear) ionized or neutral absorption, down to EW <\u223c 30 m\u00c5 (3\u03c3) of Dunn\net al. (2007). However, we do detect several absorption lines in the wavelength range 11376\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/index.html\n\n7\n\nhttp://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/IRAF scripts.html\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n1155 \u00c5 (Figure 8). The strongest of these lines are easily identified as Galactic FeII, PII and\npossibly H2 transitions. These lines are all relatively narrow , with typical FWHM\u2243 50 \u2212 70\nkm s\u22121 8 , and exhibit two velocity components at v1 \u2243 0 and v2 \u2243 +200 km s\u22121 (for the\nlow-ionization atomic transitions) 9 , and v1 \u2243 0 and v2 \u2243 +70 km s\u22121 (for the molecular\ntransition: Wakker, 2006): Figure 8.\nHowever, we also detect a broader absorption complex at the centroid wavelength of\n\u03bb = 1147.1 \u00c5, and at single-line statistical significances of 4.1\u03c3 (Figure 8) 10 . We model\nthis absorber with a negative Gaussian, and list its best-fitting parameters and equivalent\nwidth in Table 1 11 .\n\u22121\nThis absorption line is broad (FWHM= 160+50\n\u221230 km s ) and cannot be identified with\nany strong Galactic transition. We identify this absorber as a broad HI Ly\u03b2 (BLB) at\nzBLB = (0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001). The X-ray redshift of the OVIII K\u03b1 absorber is consistent with\nzBLB . At the best fitting X-ray temperature of logT=6.56 K, the thermal speed of protons\n\u221a\nis 2b = 250 km s\u22121 and so the expected broadening of HI absorption lines is FWHM\u2243 400\nkm s\u22121 . The width of the zBLB HI absorber is marginally consistent, at a 2.5\u03c3 level, with\nthe expected broadening (Fig. 9). Here we therefore assume that the HI BLB is associated\nwith the bulk of the X-ray OVIII absorber.\n\nThere is no detectable OVI or NIII absorption associated with the zBLB HI absorber.\nThe non-detection of OVI puts a much more stringent lower limit on the temperature of the\ndetected WHIM filament. At the best fitting X-ray temperature the relative fraction of OVI,\n+40.6\n\u22124\n\u03beOV I = 2.0+9.0\n1.8 \u00d7 10 , predicts (for unsaturated lines) EW(OVI)= 7.6\u22126.8 m\u00c5. From the\n8\n\nWith the exception of the high velocity component of the FeII(\u03bb1144.94) absorber, at \u03bb = 1145.7 \u00c5, for\nwhich we measure FWHM= (100 \u00b1 40). This absorber could be at least partly contaminated by intervening\nHI Lybeta absorption at z = (0.1170 \u00b1 0.0001), i.e. still consistent with the X-ray redshift of the putative\nOVIII intervening absorber, and so possibly representing a second HI component associated with this hot\nintervening WHIM filament.\n9\n\nThere are also two known velocity components in high-ionization OVI Galactic (or Galactic halo) absorption, along the line of sight to PKS 0558-504, in the velocity ranges \u2212115 \u2013 +135 km s\u22121 (Savage, 2003)\nand +210 \u2013 +315 km s\u22121 (Sembach et al., 2003).\n10\n\nThe associated 1\u03c3 error here, and anywhere else in the paper, is only statistical. By taking into account\nthe vagaries of continuum placement and fixed-pattern noise in the Lif2A FUSE spectrum of PKS 0558-504,\nwe estimate an additional 14% systematic 1\u03c3 uncertainty. This would reduce the significance of the broad\nline at \u03bb = 1147.1 \u00c5, from 4.1\u03c3 to 3.7\u03c3.\n11\n\nWe note that we this line is also clearly visible in the co-added Lif1B spectrum, with a slightly larger,\nbut consistent, EW. However, due to the unreliability of the LIf1B channel at \u03bb >\n\u223c 1140 \u00c5 (see footnote 1,\n\u00a72), we conservatively decided not to consider this as a supporting evidence.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nFUSE data we have EW(OVI)z=0.118 <\u223c 12 m\u00c5 at a 1\u03c3 confidence level (Table 2). By linearly\ninterpolating between expected OVI fractions and EWs, we derive the 1\u03c3 upper limit on\nthe fraction of OVI corresponding to the measured EW(OVI) upper limit, and from this\nthe 1\u03c3 lower limit on the temperature of the absorber. This gives: logT> 6.52. Thus by\ncombining the UV and X-ray constraints on the temperature of the WHIM filament, one\ngets logT= 6.56+0.17\n\u22120.04 (Table 3).\nThe IUE satellite observed PKS 0558-504 twice with the 'Short Wavelength Primary'\n(SWP), low-resolution (\u2206\u03bb = 6 \u00c5) spectrometer, on 1987 September 22, and 1989, November\n14-15. We retrieved the data products of these three observations from the MAST archive 12\n, and analyzed them with Sherpa (v. 4.1.2 13 ; Freeman, Doe & Siemiginowska, 2001). The\nthree SWP Low-Resolution spectra (LR) of PKS 0558-504, are dominated by the intrinsic\nnuclear AGN continuum and emission line spectrum. However, the two spectra with highest\nS/N (obsid 37589 and 37604; Table 1) show also marginal evidence for a narrow absorption\nfeature imprinted on the blue wing of the HI Ly\u03b1 broad emission line of PKS 0558-504, at\n\u03bb \u223c 1360 \u00c5 (Figure 10). We fitted the three spectra simultaneously with a model, consisting\nof a powerlaw plus narrow and broad components of the HI Ly\u03b1 and NV AGN emission lines\nand a negative absorption line to model the absorption feature at \u03bb \u2243 1360 \u00c5. The best-fitting\nparameters for this absorption line are listed in Table 2. We tentatively identify this lowsignificance (1.7\u03c3) absorber as an intervening broad HI Ly\u03b1 (BLA) at zBLA = 0.119 \u00b1 0.001,\na redshift consistent with that of the zBLB HI absorber detected by FUSE. Figure 10 shows\na portion of the highest S/N 1989 IUE-SWP LR (obsid 37604) spectrum of PKS 0558504, with our best-fitting superimposed, and the residuals after subtracting the Gaussian at\n\u03bb = 1360 \u00b1 1 \u00c5.\n4.1.\n\nSummary of the Observational Evidence\n\nThe Far-UV and X-ray spectra of PKS 0558-504 show evidence for complex absoprtion,\nwhich is unlikely to be intrinsic to the AGN itself (\u00a75.1). Figure 11 summarizes these\nconclusions, by showing the residuals (in \u03c3), in velocity space, to the best fitting continuum\nmodels to the FUSE (top panel), IUE-SWP LR (1989; second panel from the top) and\nXMM-Newton (GO: 3rd and 5th panels from the top; CAL: 4th panel from the top) spectra\nof PKS 0558-504. The residuals are centered around the absorption lines that we identify as\nHI Ly\u03b2, HI Ly\u03b1, OVIII Ly\u03b1 and FeXVII L (\u03bb = 15.015 \u00c5, rest frame), at a mean common\n12\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/index.html\n\n13\n\nhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/index.html\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nredshift of z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001 (all lines are consistent with this redshift). The red arrows in\nthe figures indicate the best-fitting centroid of each line in their respective spectra.\nThe FeXVII L \u03bb = 15.015 \u00c5) line (bottom panel) is only seen at 1.5\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 in the\nRGS1 GO and RGS2 CAL spectra (Figs. 5 and 6), and is not visible in either the RGS2\nGO or in the RGS1 CAL spectra, although all data are consistent with the presence of\nthis line at the strength predicted by the best-fitting WHIM model. The OVIII K\u03b1 line is\npresent both in the GO (3rd panel from the top) and CAL (4th panel from the top) RGS1\nspectra (the RGS2 is blind in this spectral region). Finally, possible HI lines are seen both in\nthe FUSE (top panel) and IUE-SWP LR spectra: a BLB is detected in the high resolution\nFUSE spectra, at redshifts zBLB = (0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001), and an unresolved BLA is hinted in\nthe IUE spectra at zBLA = (0.119 \u00b1 0.001). Both redshifts are consistent with that of the\nX-ray absorbers, within their 1\u03c3 uncertainties. Finally we note that the measured ratio\nEWBLA /EWBLB = (15 \u00b1 10), between the equivalent width of the low-significance BLA line\n(IUE) and the BLB line (FUSE) is consistent, within the large statistical errors, with the\npredicted value of (EWHI )Ly\u03b1 /(EWHI )Ly\u03b2 \u2243 7.4, for unsaturated lines 14 .\nThe combined statistical significance of this detection is 5.2\u03c3 (4.6\u03c3 if systematics are\nconsidered, and the small conribution from the putative HI BLA is not included).\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRuling Out Intrinsic Absorption\n\nThe Far-UV and X-ray absorber along the line of sight to PKS 0558-504, is only \u223c \u22126000\nkm s\u22121 from the systemic redshift of PKS 0558-504. In principle, then, it could be identified\nwith a high-velocity outflow ejected from the Seyfert's nuclear region in the direction of\nour line of sight. Such phenomena are common in AGNs, and are known with the name\nof \"Warm Absorbers (WAs, in X-rays: e.g. George et al. 1998; Piconcelli et al., 2005)\nor \"Narrow Absorption Line\" absorbers (NALs, in the UV: e.g. Crenshaw, Kraemer &\nGeorge, 2003). However, we note that, the physical, chemical and dynamical properties of\nthe detected absorber are all quite different from those typically found in WAs and NALs,\ncommonly detected in Seyferts and higher luminosity quasars.\n14\n\nFor unsaturated lines, the equivalent width ratio of two electronic transitions 1 and 2 from the same\nseries of the same ion X i , is linearly related to the product between their oscillator strength (f ) ratio times\nthe square of their rest-frame wavelength (\u03bb) ratio: i.e. (EWX i )1 /(EWX i )2 \u2243 (fX i )1 /(fX i )2 \u00d7 (\u03bb1 /\u03bb2 )2 .\nThus, for the Ly\u03b1 and Lybeta transitions of HI, one expects: (EWHI )Ly\u03b1 /(EWHI )Ly\u03b2 \u2243 7.4.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nWA/NAL outflow velocities typically span a range of few hundreds to few thousand km\ns\u22121, with >\u223c 80% of the objects having vout <\u223c 1500 km s\u22121 (e.g. Blustin et al., 2005 for WAs\nin X-rays, and Kriss, 2002 Crenshaw, Kraemer & George, 2003 for NALs in the UV) and are\nnormally found to be present in several physical (temperature, and densities) and velocity\ncomponents in a single object both in X-rays (e.g. Krongold et al., 2003, 2005, 2009) and in\nthe UV (e.g. Kriss, 2002; Crenshaw, Kraemer & George, 2003). Here we measure an extreme\nvelocity outflow of \u22126000 km s\u22121 and do not detect any other X-ray or FUV systems at lower\nvelocity. The existence of very high ionization (FeXXV and FeXXVI) X-ray outflows, with\nsub-relativistic (i.e. \u223c 0.1c) outflow velocities has been recently proposed for few objects\n(Reeves et al., 2009, and reference therein), but the existence and identification of these\nfeatures are still highly debated (e.g. Uttley, 2009). In all such proposed cases, however,\nthe high-ionization absorber has very high equivalent hydrogen column density (f ew \u00d7 1023\ncm\u22122 ), is seen often together with other lower velocity, lower ionization components, and in\nsome cases requires super-solar Fe abundance (Reeves et al., 2009 and references therein). We\nchecked the high S/N XMM-Newton GO EPIC spectrum of PKS 0558-504 for the presence\nof blue-shifted He- or H-like Fe absorption, and did not find any down to an equivalent\nhydrogen column densities of >\u223c 1021 cm\u22122 .\nWA metallicities, when measured, are typically found to be at least Solar (e.g. Fields\net al., 2005, 2007), in sharp contrast with the 1-5% Solar value we measure for this absorber. We stress that our metallicity estimate for the z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001 absorber is virtually\nmodel-independent. The HI fractions in purely photoionized or collisionally ionized clouds\nof gas that best-fit the RGS spectra of PKS 0558-504, are almost indistinguishable from\nthe HI fraction that we derive from our best-fitting hybrid-ionization WHIM models. So,\nthe metallicity-correction needed to reconcile the HI BLB (FUSE) and BLA (IUE) column\ndensity measurements with the X-ray equivalent hydrogen column density estimate, is independent on the model used to fit the X-ray data.\nFinally we stress that high-ionization WAs are virtually always found to co-exist with\nlower-ionization phases (e.g. HIP and LIP, Krongold et al., 2003, Andrade-Velasquez et al.,\n2009), which in turn are often one to one associated with NAL components in the UV. In\nthe case of PKS 0558-504 we do not detect any intrinsic OVI or CIV absorption (see also\nDunn et al., 2007). All this makes the identification of the detected absorber with a high\nvelocity nuclear ionized outflow, unlikely.\nA WA with unprecedented velocity, metallicity and ionization phases, appears to us to\nbe less likely than the well-predicted WHIM possibility. We therefore tentatively identify\nthis complex absorber with an intervening WHIM filament at the mean common redshift\nof z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001, and in the following discussion associate the X-ray absorber with the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFar-UV BLB and BLA detected in the FUSE and IUE spectra.\n\n5.2.\n\nMetallicity and Thickness of the WHIM Filament\n\nIn principle, the detection of clearly associated metal and HI transitions from the same\nWHIM filament, allows one to measure the the metallicity of the absorber. In our case,\nthe spectral resolution of the X-ray data is much poorer than that of the superior quality\nFUSE data, and the best-fitting width of the HI BLB absorber tentatively identified at a\n\u22121\nredshift consistent with that of the X-ray absorber (FWHM=160+50\n\u221230 km s ) , is narrower\nthan the expected HI BLB thermal width in gas with the temperature inferred from teh\nX-ray data. Thus a direct association between the HI BLB and the OVIII absorbers cannot\nbe clearly established, based on these data. However, both the redshifts of the HI BLB and\nthe OVIII absorbers, and the thermal width of the HI BLB lines, are consistent, within the\nlarge uncertainties (e.g. Fig. 9), with the hypothesis that the bulk of the HI and the OVIII\nabsorbers are imprinted by the same gas. Under this assumption, we then estimate the\nmetallicity of the putative WHIM filament, and note that this estimate would translate in a\nlower limit if the BLB and the metal absorbers were structured or not one-to-one associated.\nFrom the measured temperature, logT= 6.56+0.19\n\u22120.04 we derive the relative fraction of HI\n\u22128\ncompared to total H: \u03beHI = (5.4+0.5\n)\n\u00d7\n10\n.\nAs\nalready mentioned in /S 3.3, the best\u22122.0\nfitting temperature of the absorber is virtually independent on metallicity. We checked this\nby building two additional grids of models (other the one with Z = Z\u2299 used to fit the\nX-ray data) with metallicity of Z = 0.1Z\u2299 and Z = 0.01Z\u2299 . Figure 12 shows the OVIII\nto HI fractional abundance ratio as a function of the temperature of the gas, for Z = Z\u2299\n(black, solid curve), Z = 0.1Z\u2299 (red, solid curve)and Z = 0.01Z\u2299 (green, dashed curve).\nThe ionization balance of the gas, at equilibrium, is virtually independent on the value of\n\u22128\nZ. From the metal-independent ionization correction value (i.e. \u03beHI = (5.4+0.5\n\u22122.0 ) \u00d7 10 ),\nand the intrinsic (i.e. at z= 0.1183) HI column of NHI = (9 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 (infered\n\u22121\nfrom the measured EW(BLB)= 66 \u00b1 16 m\u00c5 and FWHM(BLB)= 160+50\n\u221230 km s ), we can\nthus derive the expected equivalent H column density of the absorber, which turns out\n21\ncm\u22122 (Table 3). Our best fitting WHIM model measures\nto be: NH = (1.7+0.7\n\u22120.4 ) \u00d7 10\n19\n\u22121\nNH = (3.2+3.1\ncm\u22122 . This gives Z/Z\u2299 = 0.02+0.02\n\u22121.6 ) \u00d7 10 (Z/Z\u2299 )\n\u22120.01 , or Z = (1 \u2212 4)% Z\u2299\n(Table 3).\nWith an estimate of the equivalent hydrogen column density of the absorber in hand, we\ncan estimate the thickness of the absorber along the line of sight. This is given, assuming homogeneity by the ratio between the column and the volume baryon densities of the absorber:\nD =Nb /nb . The value of nb is not constrained by the XMM-Newton data of PKS 0558-504.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nHowever, hydrodynamical simulations that include feedback from galaxy super-winds predict\nthat nb in the WHIM correlates with temperature (e.g. Figure 3 in Cen & Ostriker, 2006),\nand that for a given temperature, lower metalicities are normally found in higher density\nenvironments (e.g. Figure 14 in Cen & Ostriker, 2006) 15 . From Fig. 14 of Cen & Ostriker\n(2006), at T \u223c 5\u00d7106 K, metalicites of the order of log(Z/Z\u2299) \u2243 \u22121.5 are reached at overdensities, compared to the average density of the Universe (< nb >= 2\u00d710\u22127 (1+z)3 (\u03a9b h2 /0.02))\nof \u03b4 = nb / < nb >\u2243 300 16 . At z = 0.118 and assuming h = 0.7, and \u03a9b = 0.046, this gives\n\u22121\nnb \u2243 10\u22124 cm\u22123 . This implies D \u2243 5+2\nMpc.\n\u22121 \u00d7 (nb / < nb >)\nTable 3 summarize the physical and geometrical parameters of the WHIM filament at\nz = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001, along the line of sight to PKS 0558-504.\n5.3.\n\nNumber Density and Cosmological Mass Density of WHIM\n\nA tentative OVIII detection along a single line of sight cannot be used to measure the\nnumber density of OVIII filaments and the cosmological mass density in the WHIM. However,\nwe think that, in this particular case, this exercise is instructive, because it clearly shows the\nserendipitous nature of the detection, and its bias toward dense (i.e. high equivalent width)\nand rare absorbers.\nHIM\nWe estimate the number density of OVIII WHIM filaments, dNOV III /dz and \u03a9W\n,\nb\nby taking into account the large Poissonian errors associated with small number statistics\nW HIM\n(Gehrels, 1986) 17 . We get: dNOV III /dz = 7.3+21.1\n= 0.18+0.54\n\u22126.6 and \u03a9b\n\u22120.16 (90% significance). These numbers should be compared to the expected number density of WHIM\nfilaments along a random line of sight, and to the total number of baryons as inferred by both\nmicrowave background anysotropies (\u03a9b = 0.046 \u00b1 0.002, Bennett et al., 2003; Spergel et al.,\n2003) and by the standard \"big-bang nucleosynthesis\" when combined with light-element\n\n15\n\nThis is because super-winds are very efficient in metal-polluting the IGM in the proximity of the host\ngalaxy, but can only spread a finite amount of metals in a finite volume. Therefore IGM regions with lower\nprimordial baryon densities will increase their gas metal content more than regions with initially higher\nbaryon densities.\n16\n\nThis is consistent with our a-priory assumption of freezing the value of the baryon density to nb = 10\u22125\ncm in our fit to the X-ray data, since at nb \u2265 10\u22125 cm\u22123 the contribution of photoionization is negligible,\nand the best-fitting temperature and column densities are not affected by the exact value of this paremeter.\n\u22123\n\n17\n\nWe do not try to include systematics here, because of the aready big (and probably domaniting) statistical\nuncertainties associated with a single detection, which allow for the estimate to be consistent with all possible\ntheoretical predictions.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nratios (\u03a9b = 0.044 \u00b1 0.004, Kirkman et al., 2003). From Cen & Fang (2006; their Figure\n4), we derive dNOV III /dz(EW > 9 m\u00c5) \u2243 0.8. This is consistent with the 90% significance\nHIM\nlower limit of our estimate. Similarly, our estimate of \u03a9W\n/\u03a9b = 3.9+11.7\n\u22123.5 greatly exceeds\nb\nthe expected value of about 40-50 % at z \u223c 0 (e.g. CO06), but is consistent within the\nlarge 90% uncertainities. This is not surprising, since the WHIM detection we report is a\nserendipitous discovery in the spectrum of a target whose observations were not planned with\nthis aim, and as such is biased toward dense (i.e. high equivalent width) and rare absorbers.\n\n5.4.\n\nCaveats and their Solutions\n\nAlthough the association between UV and X-ray absorbers reported here, makes this\ndetection of a probable WHIM filament the first for which a metallicity measure is possible,\nwe caution that, due to instrumental limitations and uncertainties, a definitive identification\nof this absorber with an intervening WHIM filament, is not possible with the current data.\nFirst, the absorption that we identify here in X-ray as an OVIII Ly\u03b1 at z = 0.117\u00b10.001,\ncould also, in principle be identified as OVII K\u03b2 near the systemic redshift of PKS 0558-504.\nWe reject this interpretation based on the non-detection of associated OVII K\u03b1 absorption\nwith the predicted strength ( >\u223c 6 times stronger than the detected line) - together with several\nother strong lines that should be detectable in the X-ray spectrum (CVI, NVI, NVII, NeIX,\netc.) - and the lack of intrinsic OVI absorption in the RGS and FUSE spectra of PKS 0558504, respectively. Moreover, the absorption seen both in FUSE and IUE and here identified\nas HI absorption cannot plausibly be identified with any transition at or near the systemic\nredshift of the target. Unfortunately, however, the OVII K\u03b1 transition which would be\nassociated with OVII K\u03b2 at z \u2243 zsou , falls close to a strong RGS instrumental feature, which\nmakes the source-frame absorption hypothesis difficult to reject with high confidence. The\nidentification of the reported X-ray absorber with intrinsic nuclear OVII K\u03b2 is thus unlikely,\nbut not impossible based on the current X-ray data only. The only way of confirming\nthe intervening origin of the X-ray absorber would be to clearly detect the other two lines\npredicted by the best-fitting WHIM model (one of which already hinted in the GO RGS1\nand CAL RGS2 spectra of PKS 0558-504): i.e. FeXVII L(\u03bb = 15.015 \u00c5) and NeIX K\u03b1,\nwhich fall at \u03bb = 15.02 and \u03bb = 16.77 \u00c5. This is a task that only the Chandra LETG grating\ncould accomplish, thanks to its 40 cm2 effective area at this energies (vs \u223c 50 cm2 for the\nRGS2 and \u223c 15 cm2 for the Chandra MEG), and factor of \u223c 2.5 better spectral resolution,\ncompared to the RGS.\nSecond, while our identification of the absorber as a system at z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001 is\nthe most probable with the currently available data, its origin might not be intervening.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThe absorber could also be intrinsic to the nucelar Seyfert environment, outflowing from\nthe nucleus of PKS 0558-504. We discuss this possibility in \u00a75.1, and conclude that the\nphysical parameters inferred for this absorber, make this interpretation unlikely. A way to\ndefinitely exclude this possibility, is to look for variability of the X-ray and far-UV features\nreported here. Observations with the HST-COS of the far-UV spectrum of PKS 0558504, would not only definitely confirm or rule out the existence of Ly\u03b1-\u03b2 absorption at\nz = 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001 (the redshift in FUSE), but would also test for opacity (i.e. ionization\nstate and/or column density) variability of this absorber, which, if detected, would make\nthe WHIM identification impossible. Analogously, new high S/N X-ray (Chandra) highresolution spectra of PKS 0558-504 would allow one to check for variability of the X-ray\nabsorber.\nA third observation that can help sheding light on the true identification of this absorber, by either strongly supporting or weakening the support for its intervening nature,\nis a measure of the galaxy density in the region surrounding the putative WHIM filament\nat z = 0.118. WHIM filaments are supposed to correlate strongly with concentrations of\ngalaxies and with Large Scale Structure (e.g. Stocke et al., 2006b). Unfortunately, the line\nof sight to PKS 0558-504 lies in the Southern sky, at a location which is currently poorly\ninvestigated: none of the major galaxy surveys or deep surveys (e.g. 2dF 18 , 6dF 19 , SDSS\n20\n), covers this region of the sky. Wide-field, multi-band observations, centered on the line\nof sight to PKS 0558-504, and sensitive down to a fraction of L\u2217 at z = 0.118, would allow\nphotometric redshifts of the galaxies in the field to be determined with sufficient accuracy to\nexclude foreground and background objects. Spectroscopic follow-ups would then allow one\nto precisely estimate the galaxy density at z = 0.118 in a surrounding area around the line\nof sight to PKS 0558-504, to investigate on the association of WHIM filaments and LLSs.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe reported on the first combined and possibly associated Far-UV and X-ray tentative\ndetection of a WHIM filament at a mean common redshift of z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001, along the\nline of sight to the Seyfert PKS 0558-504. Our main findings are:\n\u2022 OVIII Ly\u03b1 absorption is tentatively identified at z = 0.117 \u00b1 0.001 in two independent\n18\n\nhttp://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/\n\n19\n\nhttp://www.aao.gov.au/local/www/6df/\n\n20\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nXMM-Newton RGS1 spectra of the Seyfert galaxy PKS 0558-504: a high S/N 480 ks\nnet GO spectrum taken in 2008, and the sum of a number of much lower S/N spectra\ntaken between 2000-2001 as part of an XMM-Newton calibration campaign, with a total\nnet expsoure of 309 ks. The combined, single-line significance of these two detections\nis 2.8\u03c3.\n\u2022 When fitted with a model including proper parameterizations of the continua together\nwith our hybrid (collisional ionization plus photoionization) WHIM absorption model,\nthe two ful-band RGS1 and RGS2 spectra are consistent with the presence of a WHIM\n+3.1\n19\n\u22121\nfilament at z = 0.117 \u00b1 0.001 with logT= 6.56+0.19\n\u22120.17 and NH = (3.2\u22121,6 ) \u00d7 10 (Z/Z\u2299 )\ncm\u22122 . Based on X-ray data only, the parameters of this model are poorly constrained\nand both represent only lower limits at a 3\u03c3 statistical confidence level.\n\u2022 Archival FUSE data of PKS 0558-504 show the presence of a broad absorption complex at \u03bb = 1147.1 \u00b1 0.1, with single-line statistical significance of 4.1\u03c3 (3.7\u03c3 when\nsystematics are included). This line can be identified as broad HI Ly\u03b2 at zBLB =\n(0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001), consistent with the redshift of the putative X-ray OVIII Ly\u03b1, within\nthe large X-ray uncertainties. The width of this BLB absorber is marginally consistent, at a 2.5\u03c3 level, with the thermal width of HI ions in gas with logT= 6.56+0.19\n\u22120.17\n(the best-fit temperature derived from the X-ray data).\n\u2022 Archival IUE-SWP, low-resolution, spectra of PKS 0558-504 taken in 1987 and 1989,\nalso hint to the presence of an unresolved intervening HI Ly\u03b1 at zBLA = 0.119 \u00b1 0.001,\nwith a single-line statistical significance of only 1.7\u03c3. The redshift of this absorber\nis consistent, within their relative 1\u03c3 uncertainties, with the redshift zBLB of the HI\nabsorber detected with FUSE. The BLA (IUE) to BLB (FUSE) equivalent width ratio\nof these two lines, is consistent with the expected unsaturated value.\n\u2022 We tentatively associate the OVIII Ly\u03b1 X-ray absorber at z = 0.117 \u00b1 0.001, with\nthe far-UV BLB and BLA absorbers at zBLB = (0.1183 \u00b1 0.0001) and zBLA = 0.119 \u00b1\n0.001, respectively, and identify them with an intervening WHIM filament at the mean\ncommon redshift of z = 0.118 \u00b1 0.001. The combined significance of this detection is\n5.2\u03c3 (4.6\u03c3 if systematics in the FUSE continuum modeling are taken into account and\nthe IUE HI BLA line is not considered).\n\u2022 The above identification allows us to estimate for the first time the equivalent hydrogen\ncolumn density of the absorber and so its metallicity under the assumption that the\nbulk of the HI BLB and the OVIII absorbers are physically associated. These turn out\n21\nto be: NH = (1.5+0.7\ncm\u22122 and Z = (1 \u2212 4)%Z\u2299 . If the HI BLB and the OVIII\n\u22120.4 ) \u00d7 10\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nabsorbers are not directly associated or are structured, the above estimate represent\nupper and lower limits, respectively.\n\u2022 The non-detection of associated OVI absorption in the FUSE spectrum of PKS 0558504, allows us to put a stringent lower limit on the temperature of the absorber: by\ncombining X-ray and FUSE data we obtain: logT= (6.56+0.19\n\u22120.04 ) K.\n\u2022 From the theoretical correlation between the temperature of WHIM filaments and\ntheir overdensity (relative to the average density in the Universe) and the expected 3D\nmetallicity-temperature-overdensity relationship, we derive an overdensity of \u03b4 \u223c 300\nfor our system, and therefore a thickness along the line of sight of 5+2\n\u22121 Mpc.\n\u2022 Finally from this single detection we extrapolate the number density of OVIII Ly\u03b1\nWHIM absorbers, and the cosmological mass density of WHIM. Both are consistent,\nwithin their large 1\u03c3 uncertainties due to the low-number statistics, with the expected\nvalues, but their central-values are significantly higher due to the natural bias toward\ndense (i.e. high equivalent width) and rare absorbers associated with serendipitous\nWHIM detections.\n\nFN, LZ and MLC acknowledge support from the LTSA grant NNG04GD49G.

The ionization\nbalance of the gas, at equilibrium, is virtually independent on the value of Z, and so is the\nionization correction.\n\n\f"}
