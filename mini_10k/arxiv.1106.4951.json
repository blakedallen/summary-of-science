Experimental facts demonstrate that defects, like\nvacancies, without or with the presence of non-magnetic\nad-atoms, play a main role in triggering magnetic order\nin these systems. Recently, room temperature ferromagnetism was reported in Cu-doped ZnO films, investigated\nby soft x-ray magnetic circular dichroism [19]. The results of this study strengthens the existence of the DIM\nphenomenon in general and in ZnO in particular.\nZnO is a wide band gap semiconductor, which crystallizes in the hexagonal wurtzite, zincblende and rocksalt\nstructures. However, hexagonal wurtzite is the most intensively studied crystal structure of ZnO because of its\npotential applications in the field of spintronics, transparent electronics, piezoelectricity, optoelectronics, etc.\nHydrogen is one of the most abundant and unavoidable\nimpurities in ZnO. The presence of hydrogen can influence the electrical and the magnetic properties of ZnO.\nThe role of hydrogen in enhancing the ferromagnetism in\n3d-transition metal-doped ZnO was recently studied experimentally [20] and theoretically[21]. On the other side\nthere are theoretical studies reporting on the possibility\nof room temperature ferromagnetism due to hydrogen\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: m.khalid@physik.uni-leipzig.de\n\nadsorption at the surface of ZnO[22, 23]. We note however that there is a lack of experimental and theoretical\nstudies on the possibility of hydrogen-induced magnetic\norder inside the crystalline structure of pure ZnO.\nIn this work we are interested on DIM in ZnO crystals triggered through the implantation of hydrogen at\nlow energies and its influence on the magnetotransport.\nWe report on a detailed experimental study that demonstrates how the intentional doping of hydrogen in the\npercent range and at low-enough energies influences substantially the electrical, magnetic and magnetotransport\nproperties of ZnO single crystals. In particular, we show\nin this report a hydrogen-induced anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) as well as the anomalous Hall effect\n(AHE) in H-ZnO single crystals. Therefore, the existence\nof hydrogen-induced ferromagnetism in H-ZnO samples\nis supported not only by the usual magnetization data\ntaken with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)[24] but also from magnetotransport measurements.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nHydrothermally grown ZnO (0001) single crystals of dimensions (6\u00d76\u00d70.5) mm3 with both sides polished were\nsupplied by CrysTec GmbH. The ZnO samples were exposed to remote hydrogen dc plasma for different time intervals in a parallel-plate system. The voltage difference\nbetween the two plates was kept at 1 kV. The samples\nwere mounted on a heater block held at a fixed temperature of 400 \u25e6C and they were placed \u223c 100 mm down\nstream from the plasma with a bias voltage of \u223c -330 V. A\nbias current of \u223c 50 \u03bcA was measured during the plasma\ntreatment. The pressure in the chamber during the process was maintained around 1 mbar. Three samples H-1,\n\n\f2\nH-2 and H-3 for time intervals 30, 60 and 90 min, respectively, were treated in the H-plasma chamber. The\nimplantation depth (for the chosen energy) as well as for\nthe concentration characterization analysis (see below)\nwere estimated using SRIM[25]. From this Monte Carlo\nsimulation program we estimate a penetration depth of\n20 nm for the implanted hydrogen atoms. As experimentally shown in Ref.[24] the main ferromagnetic signal\ncomes from this near surface region, in agreement with\nthe estimates.\nNuclear reaction analysis (NRA) was used to determine the hydrogen concentration in ZnO crystals before\nand after hydrogen plasma treatment [26]. The NRA\nhas a depth resolution of \u223c 5 nm with an average error\nin the concentration of 0.02%. The hydrogen concentration in ZnO crystals measured by NRA before and after\nremote hydrogen treatment was found to be 0.14\u00b10.03\nand 0.64\u00b10.07 at.% in the first 200 nm from the surface, respectively[27]. From this concentration analysis\nwe conclude that the first 20 nm near surface region\nshould have a hydrogen concentration of the order of\n\u223c 3 at.% for sample H-3. The hydrogen concentrations\nfor samples H-1 and H-2 are \u223c 1 at.% and \u223c 1.8 at.%,\nrespectively.\nWe performed Particle Induced X-ray Emission\n(PIXE) measurements to analyze the concentration of\nmagnetic impurities in the H-ZnO samples. There was no\nsignificant difference in the Fe concentration (< 60 ppm)\nbefore and after H-plasma treatment.\nThe magnetization of the ZnO single crystals before\nand after the plasma treatment was determined with a\nSQUID. The magnetotransport measurements were performed in an Oxford cryostat with a magnetic field up to\n8 T and a rotating sample holder allowing us to measure\nthe resistance at different angles between magnetic field\nand the input current. The electrical contacts on the\nsamples were prepared using silver paste in a Van der\nPauw configuration. The I/V characteristics were measured to check for deviations from the ohmic behavior.\nAll the transport data presented in this paper were taken\nin a linear, ohmic regime. The resistance was measured\nwith an ac resistance bridge with a relative resolution of\n0.01%.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nand the measured signal is given by the addition of the\ndiamagnetic plus the ferromagnetic one of the near surface region. After subtraction of the diamagnetic contribution the magnetization coming from the ferromagnetic part was calculated assuming a ferromagnetic mass\nhomogeneously located at the first 20 nm near surface\nregion[24], see Fig. 1(b). We see that the magnetization\nincreases with H-implantation as reported in Ref. 24 and\nalso decreasing temperature, compare the results of sample H-3 in Fig. 1(b) with those in the inset of Fig. 1(a).\nThe ferromagnetic magnetization per total volume of a\nvirgin, untreated ZnO crystal of the same type as used\nhere, is of the order of 10\u22124 emu/g[8]. For comparison\nand taking into account that a similar near surface region in nonmagnetic oxide crystals could be the source\nfor the ferromagnetic signals[8], the untreated ZnO crystal would have a saturation ferromagnetic magnetization\nhalf of that of sample H-1.\nAll samples exhibit a coercivity of 18-20 mT at room\ntemperature. The saturation magnetization increases by\nincreasing the H-concentration and reaches \u2243 4 emu/g\nfor sample H-3. The ferromagnetic magnetization at 5 K\nincreases by \u223c 50% of its value at room temperature\n(see inset in Fig. 1(a)). From the measurement of the\nferromagnetic remanent magnetic moment we estimate a\nCurie temperature of 450 \u00b1 25 K [24].\nRecently, N. Sanchez et al.[22] have theoretically\nshown that atomic hydrogen adsorbed on the Zn-ZnO\n(0001) surface can form strong H-Zn bonds and lead to\na metallic surface with a net magnetic moment of 0.5 \u03bcB\nper H-atom. The obtained magnetization values indicate\nthat our H-3 sample, for example, would have a net magnetic moment of 0.2 \u03bcB per hydrogen atom. This estimate is obtained taking into account the amount of H implanted. The difference between the two estimates may\nindicate that the assumed ferromagnetic mass is larger\nthan the true one. This appears plausible because the\nhydrogen atoms are not necessarily homogeneously distributed inside its penetration depth. We believe that in\nthe first 20 nm depth we have regions where the magnetic\norder is less developed and therefore one tends to overestimate the ferromagnetic mass. This picture of a rather\ninhomogeneous mixture of magnetic and non-magnetic\nregions is of importance to interpret the transport data,\nas we shall discuss below.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nMagnetization Measurements\n\nFigure 1(a) shows the magnetic moment after subtraction of the linear diamagnetic contribution vs. applied\nfield measured at 5 K for all three samples with the\nSQUID. This signal is composed by two contributions.\nThe main one is paramagnetic and follows the usual Brillouin or Langevin function. If one subtracts it from the\ndata a small ferromagnetic contribution still remains, as\ncan be seen in the inset of Figure 1(a) for sample H-3.\nAt 300 K the paramagnetic contribution is negligible\n\nB.\n\nResistivity Measurements\n\nWe measured the temperature dependence of the resistance of the three H-ZnO samples from 10 K to\n270 K, see Fig. 2. The resistance decreases increasing Hconcentration, therefore it is reasonable to assume that\nthe resistivity of the implanted part is much smaller than\nthe resistivity from the rest of the single crystal, as has\nbeen already reported [28]. This assumption is supported\nby the direct comparison of the estimated values of the\nresistivity \u2013 assuming conduction within the 20 nm im-\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\nH-2\n\n-4\n\n4\n0\n-4\n\n-1.0\n\n5 K\n\n247 K\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n100\n\n1.00\n\n(T=270K)\n\n0.98\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n10\n\n11\n\n-8\n\n-8\n\n241 K\n1.02\n\n-5\n\nH-3\n\nH-3\n225 K\n\n1.04\n\n(10\n\nM (emu/g)\n\n(10\n\n8\n\n0\n\n110\n\n(T)/\n\nResistance (\n\n)\n\n4\n\n-5\n\nemu)\n\nH-3\n\ndia\n\nm-m\n\nH-1\n\n1.06\n\nH-2\n\ncm )\n\nH-1\n\n8\n\n1.0\nH-1\n\nApplied Field (T)\n\nH-2\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nH-3\n\n0\n\n4\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nH-1\nH-2\n\nM (emu/g)\n\nH-3\n\n2\n\n0\n300 K\n\n-2\n\n-4\n(b)\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nApplied Magnetic Field\n\n2\n\n4\n\nH (T)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Magnetic moment of the three H-ZnO crystals as\na function of magnetic field at 5 K.

A diamagnetic slope\nwas subtracted from the data. Note that the magnetization\nof H-ZnO crystals increases with H-concentration.\n\nplanted thickness, right y\u2212axis in Fig. 2 \u2013 with the resistivity of the virgin ZnO single crystal, which is already at\nroom temperature several orders of magnitude larger[29].\nBefore discussing in detail the observed behavior of\nthe resistivity, we would like to describe shortly what is\nknown about the hydrogen contribution to the formation\nand/or modification of the electronic band structure\nin ZnO. Hydrogen forms shallow donor states in bulk\nZnO and is regarded as a source for n-type conductivity.\nThese shallow donor states are formed approximately\n30-60 meV below the conduction band. Upon doping\nlevel the donor energy states can be dispersed into an\nimpurity band because of the Coulomb fields arising\nfrom the compensating acceptors and ionized donors[30].\nThis impurity band could further split into two bands,\ni.e. a lower band I and an upper band I\u2212 , which are\nformed with single charged donors and neutral donors,\nrespectively[31, 32].\nAs we have already noted in section 3A, we assume that the implanted H+ -ions are not homogeneously\ndistributed in H-ZnO samples. Then, we may have\n\nFIG. 2: Resistance of the three H-ZnO samples as a function\nof temperature at a zero applied field. At the right y\u2212axis\nwe show the resistivity estimated taken into account 20 nm\nimplanted thickness of the single crystal. The inset blows out\nthe high temperature part where the resistance shows a qualitative change in its temperature dependence. The observed\nminimum shifts to the low temperatures by increasing the hydrogen concentration. The red solid lines show the fits of the\ndata to Eq. (2). The obtained values for R1 , R2 and R3 are\n(0.022, 0.014, 0.015) \u03a9, (0.587, 0.612, 0.365) \u03a9 and (197, 143,\n169) \u03a9 for samples (H-1, H-2, H-3), respectively. The rest\nresistance for all samples is R0 \u2264 10\u2212 6 \u03a9.\n\nhydrogen-rich metallic regions with resistance Rm (T ) =\nR0 + R1 T , embedded in a doped semiconducting matrix\nwith resistance Rs (T ) = R2 exp(\u2206E/2kB T ) (kB is the\nBoltzmann constant). R0 , R1 , R2 are free parameters as\nwell as the activation energy \u2206E which will be obtained\nby fitting the experimental data. Note that we consider a\nlinear T dependence for the metallic part in all the temperature range. The metallic region contributes mainly\nat high enough temperatures, see inset in Fig. 2, and\ntherefore it is unnecessary to assume a more complicated\nT \u2212dependence that may be applicable at temperatures\nT < 100 K. We consider that these two contributions,\nthe metallic- and semiconducting-like are in series. Due\nto the implantation distribution curve [24], it is clear that\nbelow \u223c 20 nm a third intermediate region should exist\nthat contributes with a resistance Rh (T ) in parallel to the\nother two.The best fits have been achieved by assuming\na variable range hopping (VRH)-like mechanism as:\nRh = R3 exp\n\n\u0012\n\nEnn\nT\n\n\u00131/5\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nWhere R3 is a free parameter and Enn is a hopping energy. The total resistance will be given then by\ni\u22121\nh\n\u22121\n\u22121\nR(T ) = (Rh (T )) + (Rm (T ) + Rs (T ))\n.\n\n(2)\n\nOne can also take into account a fourth parallel resistance contribution arising from the pure ZnO single\n\n\f4\n\nC.\n\nCharge Carriers\n\nWe performed Hall measurements in a Van der Pauw\nconfiguration in order to obtain the charge carriers density of our H-ZnO samples. Our Hall measurements confirm that the conductivity in H-ZnO single crystals is ntype. We note that the estimated carrier concentration\nis an effective one obtained using the simplest expression\nn = 1/RH e, where RH is the Hall resistance, assuming\nthat only the sample volume of the first 20 nm H-rich\nsurface layer of the ZnO single crystals contributes. In\ncase electrons and holes would contribute with different\ndensities and scattering rates then the two-band model\nis necessary to obtain the carrier densities. The use of\nits equations, however, implies the introduction of free,\nunknown parameters, like the scattering rates. In order\nto facilitate the comparison of our data with literature\nvalues we prefer to discuss the carrier density from the\nHall data stressing that the measurable quantity is RH .\nThe temperature dependent of the carrier density nH is\nshown in Fig. 3.\n\nH-1\n\n10\n\nH-2\n\n3\n\n/cm )\n\nH-3\n\n20\n\nFit\n\n(10\nH\n\nn\n\ncrystal below a \u223c 100 nm thick layer. However, the resistance of such pure ZnO crystal at all temperatures is\nin the range of M\u03a9 and therefore its contribution to the\ntotal resistance is negligible. The fittings to the data of\nthe three crystals are reasonably good as we can see in\nFig. 2. The activation energy obtained from the fittings\nfor the three H-ZnO single crystals is 60\u00b12 meV.\nQualitatively the observed temperature dependence of\nthe resistivity is rather simple to understand. At temperatures below 50 K, the resistance of the semiconducting\ncontribution Rs is larger than the resistance Rh (T ), becoming this last the dominant transport mechanism[33]\nbecause the thermal energy is not enough to excite the\nelectrons from the upper impurity band I\u2212 to the conduction band. The hopping energy obtained from the fitting\nof the experimental data is Enn \u2243 3 \u00b1 0.5 meV. As the\ntemperature increases the resistance of the H-ZnO samples decreases following a semiconducting behavior with\nen effective activation energy \u2206E \u2243 60 meV. The larger\nthe hydrogen doping the lower is Rm (T ) and therefore\nthe lower is the temperature of the minimum, see inset\nin Fig. 2. Although with this simple model we can understand qualitatively the behavior measured in the resistance as a function of temperature and hydrogen concentration, it does not provide us with a clear hint about\nthe regions that contribute to the magnetic signal. If the\nmagnetic order is confined mostly within the first 20 nm\nsurface region[24] we expect then that either the metallic\nor the semiconducting regions or even an intermediate\nregion between these two and the VRH part, contributes\nto the ferromagnetic signal. As the semiconducting contribution overwhelms in a wide temperature range the\nmetallic one, it appears plausible that this one may be\nresponsible for the magnetoresistance behavior we have\nobserved in H-ZnO single crystals.\n\n1\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Carrier density of the three H-ZnO single crystals\nas a function of temperature. The carrier density shows an\nanomalous behavior around \u223c 50 K. The solid lines are fit to\nthe expression given in Eq.( 3).\n\nThe carrier concentration of samples H-1, H-2 and\nH-3 at room temperature are 6.72 \u00d71020 cm\u22123 , 8.56\n\u00d71020 cm\u22123 and 1.27 \u00d71021 cm\u22123 . These values are comparable to those found in, e.g., Ga-doped ZnO system[34].\nAbove T \u223c 50 K the carrier density increases with temperature following the equation:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206E\n,\n(3)\nnH = a + b exp\n2kB T\nwhere a, b are free parameters. The activation energy obtained from the fits is \u2206E = 60\u00b12 meV, in agreement to\nthe activation energy values obtained from the resistivity\nmeasurements, see Fig. 2. As expected, the carrier concentration increases with hydrogen concentration. The\nincrease in nH between the samples agrees roughly with\nthe estimated increase in the hydrogen concentration.\nAt temperatures T . 50 K, nH increases with a decrease in temperature, see Fig. 3. This is an anomalous\nbehavior that appears to be related to the change of the\nmain contribution to the measured resistance, i.e. from\nthe semiconducting region above 50 K to the VRH one\nbelow it, see Fig. 2. In this case it might be that the\nsimple relation to estimate nH (T < 50K) from the Hall\nresistance is not adequate and a more complicated equation for the Hall signal of a material with two contributions in parallel should be used[35]. We note that the\nanomaly at T \u223c 50 K is observed in all the magnetotransport properties we have measured, as we will show\nin the following sections.\nD.\n\nMagnetoresistance Measurements\n\nApart from the magnetization measurements a further\nand important way to check for the existence of magnetic order is through the measurement of the magnetotransport properties.

A clear correlation between magnetoresistance and\nH-concentration is observed. The magnetoresistance increases\nwith H-concentration.\n\ntive to magnetic impurities, in case they remain below\n\u223c 0.1%, and in general they reflect intrinsic characteristics of the sample. In this section we discuss the longitudinal magnetoresistance of H-ZnO where the magnetic\nfield is applied parallel to the input current as well as to\nthe sample main plane. The longitudinal magnetoresistance for the three H-ZnO samples measured up to 8 T\nat 10 K and 250 K is shown in Fig. 4. The magnetoresistance is defined as [[R(H) \u2212 R(0)]/R(0)] where R(H)\nand R(0) are the resistances with and without an applied\nmagnetic field, respectively.\nAll samples show a negative magnetoresistance at all\ntemperatures and magnetic fields applied parallel to the\nmain plane of the samples. The negative magnetoresistance has been observed in several other ZnO systems\nthat show some kind of magnetic order[36, 37].\nFigure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the\nmagnetoresistance for the H-1 sample. Similar temperature dependent magnetoresistance is observed for the\nother two samples. It is clear from Fig. 5 that the magnetoresistace of H-ZnO decreases in general with temperature. However, its field curvature at T \u223c 50 K changes\nand from 50 K to 75 K the magnetoresistance increases\nwith temperature. The decrease in the magnetoresistance with temperature is expected because the magnetization at saturation of these samples also decreases\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nApplied Magnetic Field\n\n4\n\n8\n\nH (T)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 5: Magnetoresistance of sample H-1 (the other two samples show a similar dependence) as a function of applied magnetic field measured at several temperatures. The magnetoresistance shows a negative temperature dependence but with\nan anomaly around 50 K. The solid (red) lines through the\ndata points are fits to Eq. (4).\n\nwith temperature, see Fig. 1. As we have observed in\nthe carrier concentration, the anomalous behavior in the\nmagnetoresistance around 50 K might be related to the\nchange of the main contribution to the resistance. Taking into account that the main contribution to the magnetic signal comes from the 20 nm surface contribution,\nthe variable range hopping part and the magnetic semiconducting part might have a common interface, which\nshows magnetic order and contributes to the magnetoresistance at low temperatures.\nTo elucidate our experimental results for the magnetoresistance we use a model proposed by Khosla and\nFischer[38] that combines negative and positive magnetoresistances in semiconductors taking into account a\nthird-order expansion of the s \u2212 d exchange Hamiltonian.\nThe semiempirical formula is:\nc2 B 2\n\u2206\u03c1\n= \u2212a2 ln(1 + b2 B 2 ) +\n,\n\u03c10\n1 + d2 B 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c and d depend on the conductivity and the carrier mobility, respectively.

These results strongly suggest the contribution of s-d interaction\nin the H-ZnO system.\n\nH-1\n\n2.0\n\nH-2\n\n1.1\n\nH-3\n\n1.6\n\nLinear Fit\n\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n250\n\n0.02\n\nTemperature T (K)\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n1/T\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\n0.12\n\n-1\n\n(K )\n\n1.6\n1.2\n\nd (T\n\nc (T\n\n0.8\n\nH-1\nH-2\n\n1.0\n\nE.\n\nH-3\n\n-1\n\nH-3\n\n)\n\nH-2\n\n-1\n\n)\n\nH-1\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\nTemperature T (K)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature T (K)\n\nFIG. 6: Temperature dependence of the fitting parameters a,\nb, c and d of three H-ZnO samples.\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n2 2\n\nb = 1 + 4S \u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nAnisotropic Magnetoresistance\n\n0.6\n\n2J\u03c1F\ng\n\n\u00134 #\n\ng 2 \u03bc2\n,\n(\u03b1kT )2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mobility, g is the Land\u00e9 g-factor, \u03b1 is\na numerical constant. The fitting parameters a and b in\nEq. (4) depend on several factors such as a spin scattering amplitude A1 , the exchange integral J, the density\nof states at the Fermi energy \u03c1F , the spin of the localized magnetic moments S and the average magnetization square hM 2 i. The negative first term in Eq. (4) is\nattributed to a spin dependent scattering in third order\ns \u2212 d exchange Hamiltonian while the positive part (second term in the expression of Eq. (4)) takes into account\nfield induced changes due to the two, s and d, conduction\nbands with different conductivities.\nThe fits of the experimental data to Eq. (4) are shown\nin Fig. 5. The data can be well fitted with this model\nat all measured temperatures. All four fitting parameters show different temperature dependence (see Fig.6).\nNote that the positive magnetoresistance in our samples\nis compensated by the large negative magnetoresistance\ncontribution. Therefore, the uncertainty of the parameters c and d is rather large because they are not independent of the fitting procedure. Therefore, we concentrate on the negative scattering contributions a and\nb. The fitting parameter b for the three H-ZnO samples are plotted as a function of inverse temperature in\nFig. 6. The parameter b shows a linear dependence in\ngood agreement with theory. We found that the parameter a is almost temperature independent and increases\nwith H-concentration in the temperature range 50 K \u2265\nT \u2265 100 K indicating that the sample with higher Hconcentration (H-3) is more magnetic, in agreement with\nthe SQUID data shown in Fig. 1.\nParameters a and b defined in Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) respectively, are used in order to obtain the values of J\u03c1F\nand A1 . The values of J\u03c1F and A1 obtained from the\nexperimental data are 0.56 and 0.14 for S = 1/2 and \u03bc\n\nThere are two other magnetotransport effects, which\nare observed in our H-ZnO crystals and are worth mentioning. One of them is the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. This effect represents the change in\nthe resistance of a ferromagnetic material with the angle\nbetween the input current and applied field in plane. It\nis commonly associated with the presence of a spin splitting of the electronic band at the Fermi level and a finite\nspin-orbit (L \u2212 S) coupling. The AMR arises in second\norder in the L \u2212 S coupling, in contrast to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In ferromagnetic materials with\ns\u2212 and d\u2212bands the AMR is understood arguing that\nthe spin-orbit scattering increases the resistance by allowing a spin-flip and through this the occupation of free\nd\u2212states in the corresponding spin dependent band. In\ngeneral it is expected that the resistance is larger when\nthe applied field is parallel to the current. We define the\nAMR amplitude as\n\u2206R/Ravg =\n\n|R(Hk ) \u2212 R(H\u22a5 )|\n.\n(R(Hk ) + R(H\u22a5 ))/2\n\n(7)\n\nFor polycrystalline ferromagnetic samples the change of\nthe resistance due to the AMR has the following angle\ndependence:\n\u2206R\n= A cos2 \u03b8 ,\nR(H = 0)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the current I and the applied\nfield or magnetization direction (in saturation) and A is\na constant that depends on the density of d-states at the\nFermi level, on the magnetization as well as on the sample\nquality.\nFigure 7 shows the field dependence of the magnetoresistance for \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 and 90 \u25e6 at 10 K for the three HZnO samples. The angle \u03b8 is the angle between the applied current and the magnetic field. We observe a clear\nAMR effect in the three H-ZnO samples. We note that\nthe AMR effect was already measured in ZnO but doped\nwith Co[39]. Our results show clearly that a fundamental property of ferromagnetic materials as the AMR can\nalso be obtained by DIM in an oxide. The AMR effect\nin H-ZnO single crystals increases with H-concentration,\nsee Fig. 7.\nHowever, for ferromagnetic single crystalline systems\nsome influence from the lattice anisotropy can be expected in the AMR and in this case the angulardependent magnetoresistance is described by a Fourier\n\n\f7\n0\n\n10 K\n\n-1\n\n[R(H)-R(0)]/R(0) (%)\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\nH-1 H // I\nH-1 H\n\n-6\n\nI\n\nH-2 H // I\nH-2 H\n\nI\n\nH-3 H // I\n\n-7\n\nH-3 H\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nApplied Magnetic Field\n\n8\n\nH (T)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 7: Magnetoresistance of the H-ZnO samples at 10 K for\ntwo configurations of angles between current and the applied\nmagnetic field.

The variation\nof the angle between the magnetic field and the current\nranges from \u221250\u25e6 to 140\u25e6 . This range of angle is necessary because we expect a 180 \u25e6 periodicity. There are\nseveral distinct features in the experimental data shown\nin Fig. 8. (a) At T < 50 K the AMR is higher at \u03b8 =\n0 \u25e6 (field and current parallel to each other) than at \u03b8\n= 90 \u25e6 , in agreement with the usual behavior. (b) At\ntemperatures T > 50 K the AMR changes sign (or it\nshows a 90\u25e6 shift in the angle dependence), see Fig. 8.\n(c) Figure 9 shows the AMR amplitude, see Eq.(7), as\na function of temperature for the three samples. There\nis a clear anomalous increase with temperature between\n50 K and 100 K, in spite of the fact the the magnetization\nat saturation decreases monotonously in all the temperature range according to the SQUID measurements (not\nshown). Note that the magnitude of the AMR in our\nH-ZnO samples at 250 K is \u223c 0.4 %, a value comparable to the AMR observed in, e.g., Co films[40] or Co:Cu\nmultilayered nanowires[41]. (d) The measured angle dependence does not follow Eq. (8) applicable for polycrystalline materials and indicates that the magnetic contribution in our H-ZnO single crystals comes from a single\ncrystalline phase after H-plasma treatment. The AMR\ncurves obtained for all three H-ZnO samples are fitted\nby Eq. (9) and the results of these fits are shown in\nFig. 8 as (red) solid lines. The experimental data can\nbe fitted quite well at all temperatures after expanding\nEq. (9) up to eighth order. The coefficients sn and cn are\nrelated to the antisymmetric (Hall) and symmetric (magnetoresistance) contributions of the sample. The values\nof the coefficients sn obtained from the fits are negligibly small and therefore only the coefficients cn are shown\nin Fig. 10. The major contributions to the AMR come\nfrom the terms with n = 2, 4, 6 and 8 indicating that the\naction of the Lorentz force on the mobile charges is not\nthe source for the observed AMR in H-ZnO samples.\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\nAngle\n\n100\n\n150\n\n6.336\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n(deg.)\n\nFIG. 8: Angular magnetoresistance of sample H-1 at a constant field of 5 T at several temperatures.

X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements are necessary to obtain the required\ninformation on the elements (and bands) contributions to\nthe observed magnetic order. In particular the origin of\nthe clear anomalous behavior at 50 K . T . 100 K with\nthe unexpected change of sign of the AMR effect (factor\nC2, see Fig.10) requires further studies that go beyond\na magnetotransport characterization. We note, however,\nthat a change of sign of the AMR (and the thermopower\nS) at T \u223c 50 K has been observed for particular field directions in U3 As4 and U3 P4 ferromagnetic single crystals\n[43]. The author interpreted the abrupt change and sign\ninversion of AMR (and S) in the frame of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a large sensitivity in energy of the spin\ndensity of states at the Fermi-level due to a spontaneous\ntrigonal distortion in magnetically ordered state.\n\n\f8\n2.4\n\n6\n\nH1\n\n)\n\n40 K\n\n3\n\n(10\n\n-1\n\nH3\n\n0\n\nAHE\n\n1.6\n\nR\n\nR/R\n\nave\n\n(%)\n\n2.0\n\n10 K\n20 K\n\nH2\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n-3\n\n-6\n2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n75 K\n\n100 K\n\n125 K\n\n150 K\n\n200 K\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\nR\n\nTemperature T (K)\n\nAHE\n\n0\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.0\n\n60 K\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 9: Temperature dependence of the absolute value of the\nAMR defined in Eq.

The Hall resistance in ferromagnetic materials consists of two contributions which are\nthe ordinary Hall resistance (due to Lorentz force) and\nthe anomalous Hall resistance (due to an asymmetric\nscattering in the presence of magnetic order) and can\nbe expressed by the following equation\nRHall = RH (H) + RAHE (M ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere RH and the RAHE are the ordinary and anomalous Hall resistances and M is the magnetization. The\n\nFIG. 11: Anomalous Hall resistance of the H-2 sample as\na function of a magnetic field at several temperatures. The\nlinear background from the conventional Hall effect was subtracted from the measured curves. Note that AHE shows\nan anomalous change of field curvature above 50 K and it is\nnearly temperature independent above 225 K.\n\ndominant feature of the Hall data in our H-ZnO samples is a linear dependence of RHall with magnetic field\nwith a negative slope due to the ordinary contribution\nRH . After subtracting RH (H) from the measured data,\nan anomalous Hall effect contribution is obtained for all\nthree H-ZnO samples, as shown in Fig. 11 for sample\nH-2. Clear s\u2212like loops with very weak hysteresis are\nobserved in RAHE (H) up to 300 K. The shape of the\nloops at temperatures T < 50 K indicates that the hydrogen related paramagnetic centers dominate, in agreement with SQUID results, see Fig. 1(a). At intermediate\ntemperatures 50 . T . 150 K the behavior of RAHE (H)\nis anomalous in the sense that it has a different field\ncurvature without saturation at large fields. Note that\nin the same temperature range the carrier concentration,\nmagnetoresistance and anisotropic magnetoresistance behave also anomalously. At temperatures above 150 K the\nRAHE (H) curves follow the expected behavior for a ferromagnet, see Fig. 11.\nIn order to further investigate whether the anomalous Hall effect is mainly affected by the magnetization\n\n\f9\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\nR\n\nAHE\n\n(10\n\n-3\n\n1\n\n1\n\nHALL data\n\n0\nSQUID data\n\n0\n\n-1\n-1\n\nM (emu/g)\n\n)\n\n2\n\n-2\n300 K\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nSample H-2\n\n-3\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nApplied Magnetic Field\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nH (T)\n\n0\n\nFIG. 12: A comparison of the SQUID and the anomalous Hall\nresistance data at 300 K.\n\nresponse of the samples we compared the SQUID and\nRAHE (H) results.

Both curves are very similar,\nwhich indicate that the AHE originates from the intrinsic\nferromagnetism of the H-ZnO samples.\nIV.\n\ncrystals and in the available temperature and magnetic\nfield range. The magnitude of the magnetoresistance increases with H-concentration. We observed the anomalous Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the\nH-ZnO single crystals. The magnitude of anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance was found to be 0.4 % at 250 K, a\nvalue comparable to polycrystalline cobalt. The anomalous Hall effect data showed a quantitative agreement\nto the SQUID data for all three H-ZnO single crystals, a\nfact that excludes impurities as the origin of the observed\nferromagnetism. The observation of anisotropic magnetoresistance up to room temperature strongly suggests\nthe presence of a spin-splitted band with a non-zero spinorbit coupling in H-ZnO single crystals. At temperatures\nbelow 100 K, anomalous behaviors in the magnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and carrier density\nwere observed that are apparently related to the change\nof the main contribution to the measured resistance, i.e\nfrom semiconducting to VRH-like transport. We believe\nthat our findings would be useful for further understanding of defect induced magnetism in ZnO as well as other\noxide systems and could be the starting point towards\nan efficient and reproducible way of inducing ferromagnetism in ZnO systems.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe have studied the magnetic and magnetotransport\nproperties of H-implanted ZnO single crystals with different hydrogen concentrations in the atomic percent range.\nClear ferromagnetic-like loops were observed in all three\nH-ZnO samples at room temperature with a magnetization at saturation up to 4 emu/g. The Hall measurements confirmed the n-type transport mechanism in HZnO. We observed a negative magnetoresistance in all\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Prof. J.
