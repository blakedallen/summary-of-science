Introduction\nWKB method was first invented by Jeffreys1 and was applied to solve Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation by Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin2 . It is a powerful tool and has\nmany applications, e. g. , waves in a inhomogeneous plasma3 . Consider a\nsecond order ordinary differential equation:\n\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x) + k 2 (x)\u03c8(x) = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere prime denotes differentiation with respect to argument. The function\nk 2 may be negative for some x. In this case, we define \u03ba2 (x) \u2261 \u2212k 2 (x). WKB\nmethod approximates solutions of (1) by combinations of\n\u0012\n\nexp \u00b1i\n\nZ\n\nx\n\nk(y) dy\n\n\u0013\u001e q\n\nk(x) ,\n\n(2)\n\nprovided that\nk \u2032 /k 2 \u226a 1\n\n(3)\n\nis satisfied. If (3) is not satisfied over a range (or at a point), then we need\nto connect WKB solutions of both sides appropriately by some connection\nrelations. One common situation where (3) breaks down is that k 2 \u2248 0 near\na turning point.\nIn a recent paper4 , a quantum mechanical tunneling example is considered. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation in this one dimensional problem can be\n\n2\n\n\frepresented by (1) with\n2\n\nk (x) =\nwhere b =\n\n(\n\nE \u2212 \u03b1x2 for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 b\nE\notherwise,\n\n(4)\n\nq\n\nEb /\u03b1 and E, Eb and \u03b1 are constants. E may be assigned\n\nthe physical meaning of energy. It was shown that, for E < Eb , the true\n(numerical) tunneling probabilities Tn (see Appendix for numerical method)\nare roughly twice as large as the well known WKB tunneling factor:\n\u22122\n\nTw = e\nwhere a =\n\nq\n\nRb\na\n\nE/\u03b1 and \u03b2 =\n\n\u03ba(x) dx\n\n=e\n\nE\n\u221a\n\u03b1\n\nn\n\nln[\u03b2+\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b2 2 \u22121]\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u221a\n\no\n\n\u03b2 2 \u22121\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nq\n\nEb /E. Values of Tw and Tn for different E are\n\nshown in Table I and Table II.\nThis result was unexpected to us at first. After a little survey over some\nstandard textbooks, it was found that two books did warn about such an\nerror5,6 , although without elaborations. Another book did an example with\ncorrect connection relation7 , but did not give general discussions. Two other\nbooks used the standard tunneling factor without warning8,9 , although one\nof them indicated that it is just a rough approximation9 . In this case, we\nhave reasons to assume that the restrictions in applying the standard WKB\nformula are not very well known to students. Therefore, we would like to\nshow how to apply WKB method to solve a tunneling problem more carefully.\nIn section II, we briefly review the derivation of the standard WKB tunneling factor using standard connection relations, which are also useful for\n3\n\n\four discussions later, over a typical turning point. In section III, the tunneling factor is corrected when one turning point is a sharp edge. In section\nIV, further correction is made when the tunneling probability is not small.\nSection V considers the case that E \u2192 0. Section VI deals with the case\nthat E \u2248 Eb . Finally section VII treats the case that E > Eb . It will be\nshown that WKB method does give good approximation to the tunneling\nprobability if we use different connection relations for different energy range\nappropriately.\n\nII. Standard WKB tunneling formula\nConsider (1) with x near a turning point x = 0. Assume that k 2 (x) can be\napproximated by:\nk 2 (x) \u2248\n\ndk 2\ndx\n\nx.\n\n(6)\n\nx=0\n\nLet (dk 2 /dx)0 > 0 for the time being. Solutions of (1) with k 2 given by (6)\ncan be written as combinations of Airy's functions10 Ai(\u2212\u03bbx) and Bi(\u2212\u03bbx)\n1/3\n\nwith \u03bb \u2261 |(dk 2 /dx)0 |\n\n. Then the asymptotic behaviors of Ai and Bi give\n\nthe standard WKB connection relations10 :\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n\u221a\ne\u2212\n2 \u03ba\n\nR0\nx\n\nR0\n\n\u221a1 e\n\u03ba\n\nx\n\n\u2190\u2212\n\u03ba dy\n\n\u03ba dy\n\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\nx\nq\n\nq\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c0\nAi(\u2212\u03bbx)\n\u03bb\n\u03c0\nBi(\u2212\u03bbx)\n\u03bb\n\n4\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u221e\n\u221a1\nk\n\u221a1\nk\n\nsin(\ncos(\n\nRx\n0\n\nRx\n0\n\nk dy + \u03c04 )\nk dy + \u03c04 ).\n\n(7)\n\n\fFor (dk 2 /dx)0 < 0, we only need to change \u03bb to \u2212\u03bb in (7), interchange\nthe limits of integrations and interchange left and right hand sides. These\nstandard connection relations are valid only if the turning point is smooth\nenough, i.e., we require (6) to be valid up to some x where (3) is also satisfied.\nThis is not always possible3 .\nConsider a barrier with k 2 > 0 for x \u2264 a and x \u2265 b, k 2 < 0 for a \u2264 x \u2264 b\nand that WKB condition (3) is valid over the whole range of x except near the\ntwo smooth turning points a and b. Then for a incident wave from x = \u2212\u221e\ndirection, we have only outgoing wave for x > b:\n1 Rx\n\u03c8 = \u221a ei b k dy .\nk\n\n(8)\n\nBy (7), \u03c8 connects to:\n\"\n\n#\n\n1 R b \u03ba dy\ni \u2212 R b \u03ba dy \u2212i\u03c0/4\nx\n\u03c8= \u221a e\ne\n+ \u221a e x\n\u03ba\n2 \u03ba\n\n(9)\n\nfor a < x < b. Then for x close to a,\neI \u2212 R x \u03ba dy\u2212i\u03c0/4\n,\n\u03c8\u2248\u221a e a\n\u03ba\nwhere I \u2261\n\nRb\na\n\n(10)\n\n\u03ba dy and is assumed large. By (7) again, \u03c8 connects to\neI\u2212i\u03c0/4\n\u03c8=2 \u221a\nsin\nk\n\n\u0012Z\n\na\nx\n\nk dy + \u03c0/4\n\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n\nfor x \u2264 a. Since the sine term is just a combination of incoming and reflected\nwave with equal intensity, we have reflection coefficient Rw \u2248 1 and tunneling\nprobability Tw = e\u22122I . This is how (5) come from.\n5\n\n\fFrom the above derivation, we see that in order to apply the standard\nWKB tunneling factor (5), three conditions must be satisfied :\n(i)\n\nthere are two and only two turning points;\n\n(ii)\n\n(3) is valid except near the two turning points where k 2 can be approximated by (6); and\n\n(iii) Tw \u226a 1 .\nWe immediately see that the potential given by (4) does not satisfy (ii) since\nk 2 is discontinuous at x = b. This is the main reason for the factor of two\nerror. Also, for larger E, Tw is not very small, (iii) is also violated.\n\nIII. Sharp turning point correction\nLet us now consider k 2 with a discontinuity at x = b, so that k 2 = \u2212\u03ba2b < 0\nat b\u22120+ and k 2 = kb2 > 0 at b+ 0+ . We still assume that the WKB condition\n(3) remains valid except at b and near the smooth turning point x = a. For\nx > b, there is only outgoing wave (8). It connects to\n\uf8f1\uf8ee\n\ns\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\ns\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fc\n\ns\ns\nkb \uf8fb R b \u03ba dy \uf8f0 \u03bab\nkb \uf8fb \u2212 R b \u03ba dy \uf8fd\n1 \uf8f2\uf8f0 \u03bab\n\u03c8= \u221a\n\u2212i\n+i\nex\ne x\n+\n\uf8fe\n2 \u03ba\uf8f3\nkb\n\u03bab\nkb\n\u03bab\n\n(12)\n\nfor a < x \u2264 b. We can check whether (12) is correct by substituting x = b\ninto (8) and (12). We should see that \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 are indeed continuous. Similar\nto steps (9) to (11) and still assuming I to be large, the corrected tunneling\n6\n\n\fprobability can be found as:\nT1 =\n\n4\u03bab kb\nTw .\n\u03ba2b + kb2\n\n(13)\n\nFor k 2 given by (4),\nT1 =\n\nq\n\n4 Eb /E \u2212 1\nEb /E\n\nTw .\n\n(14)\n\nIt can be easily shown by (13) that T1 \u2264 2Tw . The equal sign holds for\nkb = \u03bab . This explains the factor of two found by ref. 4, Some values of\nTw and T1 are shown in Table I to compare with true (numerical) tunneling\nprobabilities Tn . Parameters \u03b1 = 0.040965, Eb = 1.2776 were chosen so that\nwe may compare with Table I of ref. 4. We see that T1 is much closer to Tn\nfrom E \u2248 0.2 to E \u2248 0.6 while Tw is nearly a factor of two smaller. However,\nfor large E when Tw lager than 0.2, T1 also fails since we assumed Tw to be\nsmall in the above derivation. This error will be corrected in next section.\n\nIV. Finite Tw correction\nFirst, let us consider the correction of Tw itself. If we keep both terms in (9),\nthen \u03c8 will connects to\n1\ni\n\u03c8=\u221a\n2 sin(\u03b8) + Tw cos(\u03b8) e\u2212i\u03c0/4\n2\nkTw\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nfor x < a where \u03b8 \u2261\n\nRa\nx\n\n(15)\n\nk dy+\u03c0/4. Then by finding the coefficient of incoming\n\nterm, the corrected tunneling probability can be found as:\nTw2 = Tw / (1 + Tw /4)2 .\n7\n\n(16)\n\n\fSimilarly, keeping both terms in (12) gives correction of T1 :\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nT2 = T1 / 1 + T1 /2 + Tw2 /4 .\n\n(17)\n\nSome values of T2 are also shown in Table I and Table II. We see that T2 \u2192 T1\nas Tw \u2192 0. But for large Tw , T2 differs from T1 quite a lot and gives better\napproximation to Tn up to E \u2248 1, or Tw \u2248 0.65, which is quite large.\nHowever, for E \u2192 Eb , T2 also fails. For example, for E = Eb , both T1 and\nT2 equal to zero while Tn is actually quite large. The reason for this error is\nthat we assumed that WKB condition (3) is satisfied up to x = b. This is\nnot true for E \u2192 Eb , since \u03ba is small, even for x = b, while \u03ba\u2032 is not small.\nSo we cannot use (13) or (17) for E close to Eb . Another way to apply WKB\nmethod for this case is discussed in section VI.\nIn the other extreme, the fact that for E \u2192 0, Tw \u2192finite value while\nTn \u2192 0, is another limitation of the standard WKB tunneling factor4 . Although T1 and T2 give the right value, i.e. zero, at E = 0 as shown in Table\nI, the dependence of E is wrong as we can see from Table II. We see that\n\u221a\nTn \u221d E as E \u2192 0 while T2 \u2248 T1 \u221d E. So, there are extremely large error\nbetween Tn with T1 or T2 . We will discuss this case in the next section.\n\n8\n\n\fV. For E \u2192 0\nConsider the general case first. Let k 2 = E \u2192 0 for x \u2264 a. By (12) and\nconnection formula (7), we know\n\uf8ees\n\ns\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1\n\u03bab\nkb \uf8fb\n\u03c8\u2248\u221a \uf8f0\n\u2212i\nkb\n\u03bab\nTw\n\nr\n\n\u03c0\nAi(\u03bbx)\n\u03bb\n\n(18)\n\nfor x \u2192 a+ , where \u03bb3 \u2261 \u2212 (dk 2 /dx)x=a . Again, Tw small was assumed,\nalthough this assumption can be removed if higher accuracy is desired. Now\nassume\n\u03c8 = Cei\n\n\u221a\n\nEx\n\n+ De\u2212i\n\n\u221a\n\nEx\n\n(19)\n\nfor x < a \u2192 0, where C and D are constants. Matching (18) and (19) at\nx = 0 and using the fact that E \u2192 0, we got the tunneling probability:\n\u221a\nE\n1\n\u221a =\nT =\n(20)\n2 T1 .\n2\n|C| E\n\u03c0\u03bb [Ai\u2032 (0)]\nNote that power series expansions for Airy's functions are10 :\nAi(z) =\n\nc1 f (z)\n\u2212 c2 g(z),\n\u221a\n3[c1 f (z) + c2 g(z)],\nBi(z) =\n\n(21)\n\nwhere\nz3\nz3\nz3\n1+\n1+\n(1 + * * *) ,\nf (z) = 1 +\n2*3\n5*6\n8*9\n(\n\"\n#)!\nz3\nz3\nz3\ng(z) = z * 1 +\n1+\n1+\n(1 + * * *)\n,\n3*4\n6*7\n9 * 10\n(\n\n\"\n\nc1 = 0.355028,\n\nc2 = 0.258819.\n9\n\n#)\n\n\fSo, Ai\u2032 (0) = \u2212c2 . In the derivation of (20), we assumed \u03bb finite and k 2\nsmooth enough near x = a. However, for k 2 given by (4), \u03bb = (4\u03b1E)1/6 \u2192 0.\nThis means that T \u221d E 5/6 . This is not correct since Tn \u221d E. The reason\nis that as E \u2192 0, (dk 2 /dx)a \u2192 0 while (d2 k 2 /dx2 )a = \u22122\u03b1 is constant.\nThis means that (6) is not valid and we cannot approximate solutions by\nAiry's functions. In order to correct this, we need to consider specifically the\npotential given by (4). Now, as E \u2192 0, k 2 \u2192 \u2212\u03b1x2 for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 b. Use a\nchange of variable y = \u03b11/4 x, (1) becomes:\n\u03c8yy \u2212 y 2 \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(22)\n\nThis equation can be solved by so called parabolic cylinder functions10 . Actually, we may use these functions to solve (1) with k 2 given by (4) exactly\nand write the tunneling probability in closed form. This is out of the scope\nof this paper. So let us assume that we do not know these functions. We\nwill see that we do not need to solve (22) exactly. Instead, we may study it\nby WKB method! First, note that (dy/dy) /y 2 = 1/y 2 \u226a 1 as y \u2192 \u221e, i.e.\nthe WKB condition (3) is satisfied asymptotically. So (22) has asymptotic\nsolutions given by (2) with k 2 = \u2212y 2 . Let us define two solutions of (22) by\ntheir asymptotic behaviors as y \u2192 \u221e :\nAj(y) \u2192\n\n\u2212\n\u221a1 e\ny\n\nBj(y) \u2192\n\n\u221a1 e\ny\n\nRy\n0\n\nRy\n0\n\nz 2 dz\n\nz 2 dz\n\n10\n\n=\n\n2\n\u221a1 e\u2212y /2 ,\ny\n\n=\n\n2\n\u221a1 ey /2 .\ny\n\n(23)\n\n\fThen we may write the solution for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 b as\n\u03c8 = [Bj\u2032 (\u03b7)Aj(y) \u2212 Aj\u2032 (\u03b7)Bj(y)] /2 ,\nwhere \u03b7 \u2261 \u03b11/4 b, in order to match with an outgoing solution ei\n\n(24)\n\u221a\n\nEx\n\n\u21921\n\nfor x \u2265 b. Note that we have used the fact that the Wronskian W = AjBj\u2032 \u2212\nAj\u2032 Bj = 2 and that E \u2192 0. Using similar steps as (19) to (20) and neglecting\nAj\u2032 (\u03b7) as compared with Bj\u2032 (\u03b7), the tunneling probability can be found as:\nT0 = 16E\n\n.n\n\n\u03b11/2 [Aj\u2032 (0)Bj\u2032 (\u03b7)]\n\n2\n\no\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nThis gives the correct E dependence since \u03b1 and b are independent of E. To\nfind Bj\u2032 (\u03b7), we may use (23) as a first approximation:\nBj\u2032 (y) \u2248\n\n\u221a\n\nyey\n\n2 /2\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nSo,\nT0 =\n\n16E\n1/2\n\u03b11/4 Eb\n\n2\n\n[Aj\u2032 (0)]\n\nTw .\n\n(27)\n\nThis gives the dependence on E, \u03b1 and Eb since Aj\u2032 (0) is only a constant.\nIn order to compare T0 with Tn numerically, we need to know Aj\u2032 (0), which\ncan be found by numerical integration of (22). I found11 Aj\u2032 (0) \u2248 \u22120.9777.\nUsing this, some values of T0 are shown in Table II. We can see that they are\nquite close, although there are more than 10% difference. The main error\ncan be shown to be due to the approximation in (26). To see this, we note\nthat the factor before the exponential function in (23) should actually be an\n11\n\n\fasymptotic series10 . The series of Bj can be found by requiring cancellations\nbetween terms when it is put into (22):\n2\n\n5*7\n9 * 11\ney /2\n3\n1+\n1+\n(1 + * * *)\nBj(y) \u2212\u2192 \u221a\n1+\n2\n2\ny\n4 * 4y\n8 * 4y\n12 * 4y 2\n(\n\n\"\n\n#)!\n\n. (28)\n\nThis series can be evaluated numerically up to a term with smallest magnitude. This brought a factor of 1.133 to T0 in Table II, e.g. T0 changed from\n5.97 \u00d7 10\u221210 to 6.76 \u00d7 10\u221210 for E = 10\u22128 . This is very close to Tn which is\n6.78 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\nThe dependence of \u03b1 and Eb in (27) were also be verified numerically by\nchoosing different \u03b1 and Eb . In general, as \u03b1 decreases or Eb increases, i.e.\nTw \u2192 0, the difference between T0 and Tn decreases. The fact that we can\nfind out the dependence of the tunneling probability on E, \u03b1 and Eb by using\nWKB idea without solving (22) shows how powerful WKB method may be\nif applied correctly.\n\nVI. For E \u2248 Eb\nFor E \u2248 Eb , (14) and (17) no longer give values close to Tn as we can see from\nTable I. However, we still can calculate the tunneling probability by WKB\nmethod. Now, b \u2212 a is small, we may approximate (4) by k 2 \u2248 \u2212\u03bb3 (x \u2212 a) for\nx in a region near a, including b, where \u03bb3 = 2(\u03b1E)1/2 . Then for this region,\n\n12\n\n\fthe solution is given by:\n\u221a\ni Eb\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c0e\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u001b\ni\u221a\ni\u221a\n\u2032\nEBi(\u03be) Ai (z) + \u2212Ai (\u03be) +\nEAi(\u03be) Bi (z) ,\nBi (\u03be) \u2212\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n(29)\n\u2032\n\nwhere z \u2261 \u03bb(x\u2212a), \u03be \u2261 \u03bb(b\u2212a), in order to match with an outgoing solution\nei\n\n\u221a\n\nEx\n\nfor x \u2265 b. Using standard connection formula (7), we may connect it\n\nto WKB type solutions (2) for x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Then, by grouping the coefficient\nof the incoming terms, we found the tunneling probability:\n\u221a\n4\u03bb E/\u03c0\n\nTb = h\ni2 h\ni2 .\n\u221a\n\u221a\nBi(\u03be) E \u2212 \u03bbAi\u2032 (\u03be) + Ai(\u03be) E + \u03bbBi\u2032 (\u03be)\n\n(30)\n\nThe Airy's functions can be evaluated by power series expansions (21). Some\nvalues of Tb are shown in Table I for E \u2264 Eb and in Table III for E > Eb .\nWe see that Tb gives a quite good approximation to Tn for |E \u2212 Eb | < 0.7.\nThe range of validity for this approximation is surprisingly large at first\nsight. However, if we remember that the potential is proportional to x2 so\nthat although |E \u2212 Eb | is not small, |a \u2212 b| may be small enough for the\napproximation to work.\n\nVII. For E > Eb\nFor the case that E larger than Eb , Tw = 1 while the true \"tunneling probability\"(it may be better to call it transmission coefficient now) may differ\nfrom 1 quite a lot. However, WKB method still gives a good approximation.\n13\n\n\fWe now assume that WKB condition (3) is satisfied for x \u2264 b all the way\nto \u2212\u221e. Then, we only need to match the outgoing solution ei\n\n\u221a\n\nEx\n\nfor x \u2265 b\n\nwith WKB type solutions (2) for x \u2264 b. Find the coefficient of the incoming\nterm. Then the transmission coefficient can be found\nT\u221e\n\nq\n\n4 E(E \u2212 Eb )\n= h\u221a\n\u221a i2 .\nE \u2212 Eb + E\n\n(31)\n\nSome values of T\u221e are shown in Table III. Since both T\u221e and Tn \u2192 1 as E \u2192\n\u221e. It is more appropriate to compare reflection coefficients R\u221e \u2261 1 \u2212 T\u221e\nand Rn \u2261 1 \u2212 Tn . We see that R\u221e gives a very good approximation to Rn\nfor large E. For E close to Eb , T\u221e fails and we need to use Tb instead.\n\nVIII. Conclusions\nFrom the above discussions, we see that the standard WKB tunneling factor\nTw fails badly for E \u2192 0, E \u2248 Eb and may have error up to factor of two in\nbetween. However, WKB approximation not necessarily fail provided that\nwe use appropriate connection relations. For the example that k 2 given by\n(4), WKB approximation works for almost entire energy range from E = 0\nto E \u2192 \u221e if we use different connection relations for different ranges of\nenergy. Our conclusion is that when we use the standard WKB formula Tw ,\nwe need to be very careful. If higher accuracy is desired, we need to consider\nconnection relations case by case.\n\n14\n\n\fAppendix:Numerical calculation of Tn\nAlthough a numerical method to find Tn was described in ref. 4, a different\nmethod was used in this paper.
