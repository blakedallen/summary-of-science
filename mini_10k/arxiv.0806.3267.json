INTRODUCTION\n\nThe discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) has led to an\nexplosion of interest in the underlying physics responsible for\nthis acceleration. A favored model characterizes the acceleration by an unknown energy density component, dubbed\nthe dark energy. While there exist a variety of probes to explore the nature of this dark energy, one of the most compelling entails the use of type Ia supernovae (SNe henceforth) to map the expansion history of the universe. Several present and future SN surveys are aimed at constraining the dark energy equation-of-state (EOS) to better than\n10%. With increasing sample sizes, SN distances can potentially provide multiple independent estimates of the EOS of\ndark energy when binned in redshift (Huterer & Cooray 2005;\nSullivan, Cooray, & Holz 2007; Sarkar et al. 2008a). Given\nthe importance of dark energy measurements, it is then useful to quantify various systematics that impact SN cosmology\n(Hui & Greene 2006; Cooray & Caldwell 2006; Cooray et al.\n2006; Sarkar et al. 2008b).\nRecently, suggestions have been made that the SN population consists of two components, with a \"prompt\" component proportional to the instantaneous host galaxy star formation rate, and a \"delayed\" (or \"extended\") component\nthat is delayed by several Gyrs (Hamuy et al. 1995; Livio\n2000; Scannapieco and Bildsten 2005; Mannucci et al. 2006;\nSullivan et al. 2006; Strovink 2007). The former is expected\nto be more luminous, and thus, prompt SN lightcurves are\nbroader than those of the delayed population. By classifying\nSNe by host galaxy type, Howell et al. (2007) found a precalibration intrinsic luminosity difference of \u223c (12 \u00b1 4)% be1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Irvine,\nCA 92697\n2 Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM\n87545\n3 Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics and Department of Astronomy\nand Astrophysics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637\n\ntween the two components, based on a difference of (8.1 \u00b1\n2.7)% in the width of lightcurves. Since the SN lightcurves\nare used to calibrate the intrinsic luminosity (Phillips 1993;\nRiess et al. 1996; Perlmutter et al. 1997; Tonry et al. 2003;\nPrieto et al. 2006; Guy et al. 2007; Jha et al. 2007), a systematic difference in intrinsic luminosity could conceivably be\ncalibrated out, if the SN lightcurve calibration relation is the\nsame for both populations.\nHowever, it is unclear whether the full intrinsic difference\nin luminosity between the two populations is captured by a\ncalibratable difference in the lightcurves. A residual in the\ncalibrated luminosity could potentially remain, leading to a\nredshift-dependent shift in the Hubble diagram, and systematic errors in the best-fit cosmological parameters. For example, it is likely that the intrinsic colors of Type Ia SNe are\nnot uniquely determined by light-curve shape (Conley et al.\n2008). Even if this is not the case, differences in intrinsic color between the populations might introduce systematic differences in post-calibration luminosity (e.g., through\ndifferences in the extinction corrections). We model the\ntwo-population systematic, constraining the magnitude of the\neffect with current data. With large SN samples it may\nbe possible to estimate the magnitude of the systematic directly from the data (e.g., by correlating observed SN brightnesses with properties of the host galaxies (Hamuy et al.\n1996b; Riess et al. 1999; Sullivan et al. 2006; Jha et al. 2007;\nGallagher et al. 2008)). We quantify the level of calibration\nrequired to avoid significantly degrading the determination of\nthe dark energy EOS.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in \u00a72 we discuss a model\nfor incorporating a two-population systematic residual luminosity into the Hubble diagram. In \u00a73 we investigate the possibility of detecting this systematic from both current and future\nSN data, and the impact on dark energy parameter estimation.\n2. TWO SN POPULATIONS AND THE HUBBLE DIAGRAM\n\nThe use of SNe as standardizable candles to constrain the\ndark energy EOS is based on the fundamental assumption that\n\n\f2\n\nTWO SN POPULATIONS & COSMOLOGY\n\nF IG . 1.- Left panel: Correlation between \u03b4D and w, corresponding to a wCDM model, for the 192 SN dataset discussed in the text. There is a strong degeneracy\nbetween the two-population systematic, \u03b4D , and the dark energy EOS, w. This leads to a potential bias in the measurement of the EOS, and increased errors when\nthe fits are marginalized over \u03b4D . Right panel: Histograms showing the distributions of the best-fit w, from 200 mock data sets with an inherent \u03b4D = 0.025,\nafter marginalizing over the WMAP wCDM 5-Year priors. The shaded histogram represents the case where \u03b4D is allowed to vary freely, while for the hatched\nhistogram the two-population systematic is ignored (\u03b4D = 0). The dot-dashed line corresponds to the case where the data is fit assuming a \u03b4D = 0.025 \u00b1 0.025\nprior. For clarity we omit the underlying histogram.\n\nthe lightcurves of all individual SNe can be calibrated. The\nlightcurve shape-intrinsic luminosity relation is derived using low-z samples of SNe, and it is assumed that this relation\nis applicable to the higher-z population. However, if the SN\npopulation is non-uniform with redshift, the potential for systematics must be considered (Howell 2001; Mannucci et al.\n2006; Scannapieco and Bildsten 2005; Sullivan et al. 2006).\nAccording\nto\nthe\ntwo-population\nmodel\nof\nScannapieco and Bildsten (2005) (henceforth SB), the\nprompt SNe track the instantaneous star formation rate,\n\u1e40\u2217 (t), and dominate the total SN rate at early times (high\nredshifts) when star formation is more active. The rate of\nthe delayed component scales proportionally to the total\nstellar mass at a given instant, M\u2217 (t), and thus delayed SNe\ndominate at late times (low redshifts). The total SN rate can\nbe written as\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nM\u2217 (t)\n\u1e40\u2217 (t)\nSNRIa (t)\n(1)\n+\nB\n=\nA\n(100 yr)\u22121\n1010 M\u2299\n1010 M\u2299 Gyr\u22121\nwhere A and B are dimensionless constants. We take the\nstar formation rate proportional to e\u2212t/(2Gyr) (Mannucci et al.\n2006). This model is likely to be a simple approximation to a true, smooth underlying distribution of delay\ntimes (Totani et al. 2008; Greggio et al. 2008; Pritchet et al.\n2008). For simplicity we restrict ourselves to the twopopulation model, although in \u00a73.2 we discuss sensitivity to\nthis assumption.\nWe allow for a redshift-independent residual difference\n(\u2206L) in the calibrated absolute luminosities of the prompt\n(LP ) and delayed (LD ) SNe: LP = LD + \u2206L. We take the delayed and prompt fractions of the total SN population to be\nfD (z) and fP (z), respectively ( fD (z) + fP (z) = 1).\nThe average of the distance moduli of all the SNe in a given\nredshift bin can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001c\n\u0013\u001d\n\u0012\nL\ndL\n+ 25 \u2212 2.5 log10\n, (2)\nh(m \u2212 M)i = 5 log10\nMpc\nLre f\nwhere Lre f is the reference luminosity corresponding to the\nreference absolute magnitude Mre f given by Mre f = f \u0304D MD +\nf \u0304P MP , where f \u0304i is the redshift-average of fi (z) over the low\n\nredshift range where the calibration is done. The residual\nsystematic correction to h(m \u2212 M)i can be expressed as h(m \u2212\nM)ires = \u03b4D fD (z) \u2212 2.5 log10 (LP /Lre f ), where \u03b4D = 1.086 ln(1 +\n\u2206L/LD ) is the two-population bias. Note that one can also\nexpress h(m \u2212 M)ires relative to the prompt component, using\n\u03b4P instead of \u03b4D , and fP instead of fD . This involves an overall\nsign change, but the final results are unaltered.\nUsing the \u03c72 -statistic, we fit the Hubble diagram with a\nmodified form of the distance modulus which includes a possible residual:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndL (z)\nfid\n+ 25 + M + \u03b4D fD (z). (3)\n(m \u2212 M) (z) = 5 log10\nMpc\nWe have absorbed the redshift-independent term in h(m \u2212\nM)ires into the \"nuisance parameter\", M. Note that H0 is\nincorporated into dL instead of M. The redshift-dependent\nfactor fD (z) can be determined based on our knowledge of the\nstar-formation history, and \u03b4D must be estimated directly from\nthe SN data. This residual systematic must now be marginalized over, and will affect cosmological parameter estimates.\n3. RESIDUAL SYSTEMATIC AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION\n3.1. Existing data\n\nTo study the extent to which existing data may be affected\nby a residual systematic in the luminosity difference between\nprompt and delayed SNe, we model fit a combined data\nset of 192 SNe (Davis et al. 2007; Wood-Vasey et al. 2007;\nRiess et al. 2007; Astier et al. 2006; Hamuy et al. 1996a;\nRiess et al. 1999; Jha et al. 2006). We also include two baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) distance estimates at z = 0.2 and\nz = 0.35 (Percival et al. 2007), and the dimensionless distance to the surface of last scattering R = 1.710 \u00b1 0.019\n(Komatsu et al. 2008). We take a flat \u039bCDM cosmological model and marginalize over M, with WMAP priors of\nH0 = 71.9 \u00b1 2.6 and \u03a9m h2 = 0.1326 \u00b1 0.0063 (Komatsu et al.\n2008). These priors are independent of the SN data. For simplicity we do not incorporate the correlation between \u03a9m h2\nand H0 . Such a correlation will not qualitatively alter our results, but will need to be taken into account once precision\ndata becomes available.\n\n\fSARKAR ET AL.\n\n3\n\nF IG . 2.- Left panel: The fraction of the delayed component, fD , as a function of redshift. The solid line corresponds to the fiducial A and B values\nfrom SB (Scannapieco and Bildsten 2005) that are used to generate the mock catalogs. The dashed and dot-dashed lines correspond to {A \u2212 \u2206A, B + \u2206B} and\n{A + \u2206A, B \u2212 \u2206B}, respectively, where \u2206A and \u2206B are the 1\u03c3 uncertainties on A and B from SB. The triple-dot-dashed line depicts the recent estimate of fD from\nAubourg et al. (2007). Right panel: Histograms showing the best-fit values for the dark energy EOS parameter, w, for 200 mock SN datasets with \u03b4D = 0.025.\nThe solid curve shows the Gaussian fit to P(w) for the case where we use the same fD (z) to generate the mock catalogs and fit the data. The other Gaussian\ncurves correspond to the best-fit values of w when we fit the mock data with the wrong functional form for fD (z). The mocks are generated with the fiducial\nmodel, and the line-types represent the model used in the fit, in accordance with the left panel. For clarity we only show two underlying histograms, for the cases\n{A \u2212 \u2206A, B + \u2206B} (shaded) and {A + \u2206A, B \u2212 \u2206B} (hatched). A \u223c 30% shift in fD (left panel) corresponds to a percent-level bias in w (right panel). The extreme\nmodel of Aubourg et al. (2007) corresponds to an almost redshift-independent fD (see left panel), and thus the bias is similar to that in the \u03b4D = 0 case.\n\nThe distribution function for \u03b4D from existing data has a\npositive mean value (\u03b4D = 0.049), implying that the postcalibration luminosity of the delayed population is dimmer\nthan the prompt population by \u223c5%. The standard deviation\nof this \u03b4D is \u03c3 = 0.097, which suggests that current SN data\nis consistent with the absence of a two-population bias. The\nHowell et al. (2007) result of \u223c (12 \u00b1 4)% difference in the\nintrinsic luminosity is a pre-calibration difference. We find a\n\u223c (5 \u00b1 9)% difference in the post-calibration luminosity between the two types of SNe. While this uncertainty is larger\nthan the pre-calibration value, it is estimated directly from the\nHubble diagram, and is independent of the empirical stretchluminosity relation. This important consistency check will\nimprove as the SN sample sizes increase.\nTo study the impact of a potential luminosity difference on the measurement of the dark energy EOS, we\nalso fit the same data (SN+BAO+CMB) assuming a wCDM\nmodel, and take the corresponding WMAP+HST priors H0 =\n72.1 \u00b1 7.5 and \u03a9m h2 = 0.1329 \u00b1 0.0066 (Komatsu et al. 2008;\nFreedman et al. 2001). We first consider two extreme cases:\nignoring the two-population systematic (\u03b4D = 0), and allowing for a completely unconstrained systematic (\u03b4D with no\npriors). With \u03b4D free, our analysis yields a best-fit timeindependent EOS parameter w = \u22120.986 \u00b1 0.180, with a bestfit \u03b4D = 0.040 \u00b1 0.279. If we set \u03b4D = 0, the same data provides a constraint of w = \u22120.960 \u00b1 0.066. By incorporating a\ntwo-population effect in the fit, the errors on the best-fit EOS\ndegrade by a factor of \u223c 3. In addition, we note a shift in the\nbest-fit value of w between the two cases. The evolution in\nthe ratio between prompt and delayed SNe, as a function of\nredshift, can mimic dark energy. If there is a residual difference in the calibrated luminosity, ignoring \u03b4D might bias the\ndark energy estimate. As we show in the left panel of Figure 1, the increase in the error of the best-fit EOS is due to the\ndegeneracy between dark energy (w) and the two-population\nsystematic (\u03b4D ).\nFollowing Howell et al. (2007), it may be possible to calibrate out the luminosity difference between the two compo-\n\nnents with large samples of SNe (e.g., by looking for characteristic properties in the SN spectra, or by correlating SN\nluminosities with host galaxy types). This will lead to a\nprior constraint on \u03b4D , although uncertainties will still remain\non the redshift evolution (as estimated by fD (z)). Assuming\nthe two-population fraction, and its redshift evolution, is perfectly known, we analyze the same SN data assuming a Gaussian prior on \u03b4D . Taking this prior to have zero mean and\n\u03c3 = (0.25, 0.1, 0.05), the errors on w are (0.130, 0.086, 0.072),\nwith the best-fit value of w being approximately the same as\nwas found for the \u03b4D = 0 case. Thus, by including a twopopulation systematic in the fit, with a prior on \u03b4D centered at\n0 with a 0.05 mag dispersion, we recover the same best-fit w,\nbut with \u223c 10% degradation in the error bars.\n3.2. Future data\n\nWe now turn to proposed SN surveys, and investigate how\nuncertainties in a possible two-population systematic impact\nmeasurements of w. We generate mock SN catalogs with 300\nSNe uniformly distributed at z < 0.1, and 2000 SNe in the\nrange 0.1 \u2264 z \u2264 1.7, similar to a JDEM-like survey (Kim et al.\n2004). We incorporate an intrinsic Gaussian scatter of 0.1\nmag for each SN, and take the relative fraction of delayed\nand prompt SNe, fD (z), given by Eq. 1 with SB values of A =\n4.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 and B = 2.6. We assume different values (0.025,\n0.05, 0.1 mag) for the underlying two-population bias (\u03b4D ).\nWe fit each mock data set of 2300 SNe, along with the 2 existing BAO measurements, to a wCDM model, with the corresponding wCDM WMAP+HST priors as before. When fitting the data we consider two extreme cases: \u03b4D = 0, and \u03b4D\ncompletely unconstrained. Our results for \u03b4D = 0.025, from\n200 separate mocks, are summarized in the right panel of Figure 1. The hatched histogram, which peaks at -0.974, depicts\nthe case where \u03b4D = 0 was assumed in the fit. This corresponds to a systematic being present in the data, but ignored\nin the fit. With an average error on the EOS of 0.029 from\nMCMC, the resulting bias in the best-fit EOS value is \u223c 1\u03c3\nfrom the underlying value (w = \u22121).\n\n\f4\n\nTWO SN POPULATIONS & COSMOLOGY\n\nThe shaded histogram in the right panel of Figure 1, having\na peak at -0.991 with a 1\u03c3 width of 0.071, shows the distribution of the best-fit w with 200 mocks, where we let \u03b4D\nvary freely while fitting the data to Eq. 3. In this case we\nfind no significant bias (w = \u22121 is recovered within < 0.1\u03c3),\nbut the width of the distribution and MCMC results for each\nmock sample show that the errors in the best-fit w increase\nby a factor of \u223c 2.5. When the underlying two-population\nbias is \u03b4D = 0.05 mag, we find w = \u22120.955 \u00b1 0.030 (assuming\n\u03b4D = 0 in the fit) and w = \u22120.986 \u00b1 0.067 (assuming \u03b4D unconstrained) based on 50 Monte-Carlo realizations. Generating\ndata with \u03b4D = 0.1, and neglecting the systematic in the fit, we\nfind w = \u22120.925 \u00b1 0.029 (50 realizations). As a rough rule, if\nthe two-population systematic is neglected, the resulting bias\nin the best-fit w is on the order of the magnitude of the underlying \u03b4D .\nThus far we have assumed no prior knowledge on the values of \u03b4D , although it may be possible to adduce a priori constraints on \u03b4D through SN population statistics combined with\ncorrelations to galaxy properties. We model-fit 200 separate\nSN mocks (with intrinsic \u03b4D = 0.025 mag) with two different priors: \u03b4D = 0.025 \u00b1 0.025 and \u03b4D = 0 \u00b1 0.025 mag. The\nformer case represents knowledge of the true underlying systematic (with a 1\u03c3 uncertainty of 0.025 mag), while for the\nlatter case the central value is incorrectly assumed to be zero\n(with a 0.025 mag uncertainty). With the \u03b4D prior peaked on\nthe correct value (0.025), the distribution of w peaks at \u22120.993\nwith a 1\u03c3 width of 0.034 (the Gaussian with dot-dashed line\nin the right panel of Figure 1). With the prior centered on\nthe wrong value (0 instead of 0.025), the distribution peaks at\nw = \u22120.977 (showing a small bias of \u223c 0.6\u03c3), with the same\n1\u03c3 uncertainty of 0.034. In both cases the errors in w increase\nby \u223c 30%, when compared to the equivalent dataset with no\ntwo-population effect in either the mock data or the fit.\n\nThus far we have assumed that we know fD (z) perfectly.\nEven if the two-population model is correct, uncertainties in\nA and B, or equivalently uncertainties in the star-formation\nhistory, lead to a redshift-dependent uncertainty in fD (z). To\ntest the effect of these uncertainties on parameter estimation,\nwe generate mock data sets with \u03b4D = 0.025, and fD (z) taken\nto be the canonical two-parameter form given in Eq. 1. We\nthen fit these data assuming different forms for fD (z) obtained\nby accounting for uncertainties in A and B from SB. We also\nconsider an estimate of fD from Aubourg et al. (2007). The\nresulting fD curves are shown in the left panel of Figure 2.\nIn the right panel we show the resulting bias in dark energy\nEOS measurements, as a result of the uncertainty in fD . The\nuncertainties in the population fraction lead to biases in the\nresulting EOS parameters. To control this bias to the percent\nlevel, the underlying distribution must be characterized to .\n20%.\nIn summary, we have found that a post-calibration shift in\nthe standard-candle brightness between delayed and prompt\nSNe can introduce bias in the best-fit dark energy parameters.\nBy controlling the magnitude of any resulting two-population\ndifference to better than 0.025 mag, the bias can be kept under\n1\u03c3 for a JDEM-like survey without significantly degrading\nthe accuracy of the dark energy measurements.\nWe thank Henry Ferguson, Saurabh Jha, Mario Livio,\nAdam Riess, Mark Sullivan, and Michael Wood-Vasey for\nuseful discussions.
