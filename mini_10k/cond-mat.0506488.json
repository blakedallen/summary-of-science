Indeed, strongly enhanced quantum spin fluctuations associated with the\nmagnetic instability may account for the absence of longrange magnetic order in the nearly isotropic organic antiferromagnet \u03ba \u2212 (BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 Cu2 (CN)3 , as inferred\nfrom recent 1 H NMR and static susceptibility measurements down to 32 mK, well below the estimated exchange constant J \u223c 250 K, suggesting the realization\nof a quantum spin-liquid state.10 The realization of a\nnon-magnetic insulator at intermediate U is also interesting as it allows, with decreasing U , for a Mott-type\nmetal-insulator transition not accompanied by any magnetic symmetry breaking, as seen in the layered system\n\u03ba \u2212 (BEDT \u2212 TTF)2 Cu[N(CN)2 ]Cl,11 and currently of\nmuch theoretical interest.12,13\nRecently, self-energy corrections due to multiple\nmagnon processes in the AF state of the frustrated\nsquare-lattice t \u2212 t\u2032 -Hubbard model were evaluated using a fluctuation approach.14 Quasiparticle dispersion\n\nobtained with the same set of Hubbard model cuprate\nparameters as obtained from a recent magnon spectrum\nfit15 was found to yield excellent agreement with ARPES\ndata for Sr2 CuO2 Cl2 ,14 thus providing a unified description of magnetic and electronic excitations in cuprates.\nIt is therefore interesting to examine and contrast selfenergy corrections and quasiparticle behaviour in the\n120\u25e6 ordered AF state of the triangular-lattice Hubbard\nmodel which involves non-collinear ordering, intrinsic geometric frustration, and also finite U -induced competing\ninteractions and frustration. Indeed, we find that longwavelength magnon modes yield finite contribution to the\nfermion-magnon scattering process, unlike the squarelattice case where this contribution was negligible.14\nFrustration and spin fluctuations are involved in an\ninteresting interplay with respect to quasiparticle behaviour. As neighbouring spins are not antiparallel in\ntriangular-lattice and frustrated square-lattice AF states,\nfrustration results in an O(t) or O(t\u2032 ) direct hopping\nin addition to the O(J) virtual hopping. Competition between the two dispersions results in band broadening/narrowing, which has a dramatic effect on selfenergy corrections due to significantly different density\nof fermion scattering states. Competition also results in\na reduced band gap, thus bringing the system closer to\na metal-insulator (MI) transition. The t \u2212 J model calculations do not involve this competition as the virtual\nhopping term is absent.\nIn this paper, we examine the hole and electron spectral functions in terms of self-energy corrections in the\n120\u25e6 ordered AF state of the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. Hole and electron dynamics in an antiferromagnetic background is associated with multiple\nmagnon emission and absorption processes corresponding to broken AF bonds, string states, and scrambling of\nthe AF spin ordering. The fluctuation approach adopted\nin this paper in terms of a diagrammatical expansion provides a physically transparent picture in which the hole\n\n\f2\nmotion is renormalized due to the fluctuating transverse\nfield associated with spin fluctuations. This fluctuation\nperspective is physically relevant in view of the substantial ordered-moment reduction, which approaches 59% in\nthe strong-coupling (Heisenberg) limit.16\nSingle-particle dynamics in the AF state of the\ntriangular-lattice t \u2212 J model has been studied in the\nself-consistent Born approximation (SCBA),17,18,19 exact\ndiagonalization,17 and projection techniques.20,21 Oneelectron density of states has been examined using the\nquantum Monte Carlo method,22 showing a pseudogap\ndevelopment for intermediate U .\nWe consider the Hubbard model\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nai\u2191 ai\u2191 a\u2020i\u2193 ai\u2193\n(1)\nH = \u2212t\nai,\u03c3 ai+\u03b4,\u03c3 + U\ni\n\ni\u03b4\u03c3\n\nwith nearest-neighbour (NN) hopping on a triangular lattice. The model has particle-hole symmetry under the\ntransformation t \u2192 \u2212t. In this paper we consider the\ncase of positive t and hole (electron) doping in the lower\n(upper) band; same result holds for negative t and electron (hole) doping in the upper (lower) band. In the\nfollowing we set the hopping energy t = 1.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. The threesublattice basis is briefly reviewed in section II to introduce the notation and key features of the classical-level\nfermion dispersion. Transverse spin fluctuations are introduced in section III in terms of magnon amplitudes\nand energies. Intraband self-energy corrections due to\nmulti-magnon processes are studied in section IV in the\nnon-crossing approximation. Hole and electron spectral\nfunctions for the lower and upper bands are discussed in\nsection V and conclusions are presented in section VI.\nII.\n\nTHREE-SUBLATTICE REPRESENTATION\n\nWhile the spiral-state description applies only to Bravais lattices, the sublattice-basis description applies to\nKagom\u00e9 type non-Bravais lattices as well.

The mean field \u2206\nand magnetization m are related to U through the selfconsistency condition.9\nTypical of the AF state, upper band states yield a\nnegative contribution to spin densities due to the negative sign of \u03b1+\nk . Consequently, when the two bands\nstart overlapping on decreasing U , partial occupation of\nthe upper band has an amplified effect on reduction of\nmagnetic order - reduced sublattice magnetization due\nto band overlap decreases the mean-field \u2206, which further increases the overlap. Typically, the magnetic order\ntherefore falls very rapidly after band overlap sets in.\nThe density of states (DOS) corresponding to the full\nHF (classical) dispersion in Eq. (10), shown in Fig. 2 for\nboth positive and negative t, exhibits a key competition\nbetween the two dispersion terms associatedpwith direct\nhopping (\u03b7k ) of order t and virtual hopping ( \u22062 + \u03bek2 \u2212\n\u2206), which is of order J in the strong-coupling limit.

Analysis of the fermion-magnon\nmatrix element M in the strong-coupling limit and comparison with earlier results for the t\u2212J model is discussed\nin the Appendix.\nIt is important to note here that long-wavelength\nmagnon modes yield finite contribution to the fermionmagnon scattering process in the triangular-lattice AF,\nunlike the square-lattice case where this contribution is\nnegligible.14 For the square-lattice AF, the small-q contribution was suppressed because the fermion-magnon\nmatrix element M 2 \u223c q due to destructive interference\nwithin sublattice summation.

All branches are\ndegenerate at K, second and third branches at M , first\nand second branches at \u0393, while at N = (2\u03c0/5, 0) all\nbranches are non-degenerate, exactly as at the HF level.\nThe states K, \u0393, and N , which are well inside the\nband, are strongly damped and yield dominantly incoherent spectral functions, along with small quasiparticle\npeaks at nearly same frequency \u03c9 \u2248 2 (Fig. 10). It is\nthe strong negative peak in the self energy at \u03c9 \u2248 2 (Fig.\n8) which leads to nearly same quasiparticle energy for all\nk points, resulting in drastically reduced quasiparticle\nbandwidth (Fig. 9) and enhanced effective mass. Figure 11 shows that the well-defined quasiparticle peak at\nM rapidly diminishes in intensity and disappears as one\nmoves along the M \u2212\u0393 direction. However, in the M \u2212K\ndirection, the quasiparticle peak is discernible in the full\nk range.

With decreasing interaction\nstrength, besides the explicit reduction in the fermionmagnon scattering matrix element due to U in Eq. (25),\nthe classical-level fermion and magnon dispersions are\nalso significantly modified. Due to enhanced virtual hopping and competition with the direct hopping term the\nsharp peak in the upper band DOS (Fig. 2) shifts towards\nhigher energy. Also, the magnon energy \u03c9M at momentum Q/2 decreases rapidly and vanishes at \u2206 = 2.9.9\nFig. 13 shows the modifications in the upper band DOS\ndue to these intermediate-U effects.\n\nVI.\n\nthe characteristic signature of multi-magnon processes is\ndominant for the upper band corresponding to the narrow sharp peak at the classical level. As expected within\nthe many-body expansion, the string-state signature of\nmulti-magnon processes is more prominent for higher U .\nThe renormalized gap vanishes for U \u2248 7, whereas the\nHF band gap 2(\u2206\u22122) vanishes at U \u2248 5. The band gap is\n\n0\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the hole and electron\ndynamics in the 120\u25e6 ordered AF state of the Hubbard\nmodel on a triangular lattice using a physically transparent fluctuation approach involving the dynamical spin\nfluctuations, which interpolates between the weak and\nstrong coupling limits. Finite-U , double occupancy ef-\n\n\f9\nfects, neglected in earlier t \u2212 J model studies, have been\nincorporated naturally in terms of classical level fermion\nand spin dynamics. Intrinsic features of the frustrationinduced direct hopping dispersion associated with the\n120\u25e6 ordering - the broad flat band and the narrow sharp\npeak in the fermion DOS corresponding to lowest-energy\nhole and electron states - are characteristics of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering, respectively. The\nqualitatively different self-energy corrections for hole and\nelectron can therefore be conveniently visualized in terms\nof hole (electron) motion in an effective ferromagnetic\n(antiferromagnetic) spin background projected out of the\n120\u25e6 spin ordering.\nFor an added hole in the broad lower band, the reduced density of scattering states suppresses the fermionmagnon interaction resulting in nearly coherent quasiparticle peak for all k states. No signature of string states in\nthe spectral function reflects an effective F background\nseen by holes near the top of the lower band. Quasiparticle dispersion shows a nearly momentum-independent\nshift of hole energies, implying no mass renormalization.\nFor an electron in the lowest-energy branch l = 0 of\nthe upper band, quasiparticle peak is observed only near\nthe MBZ boundary (M \u2212 K), and rapidly vanishes away\nfrom it. Strong incoherent behaviour and clear signature of string states in the spectral function is a consequence of an effective AF background seen by electrons\nnear the bottom of the upper band. The strong and\nnearly momentum-independent peak in the self energy\nleads to nearly same quasiparticle energy for all k points,\nresulting in drastically reduced bandwidth and enhanced\neffective mass.\nThe renormalized band gap was found to vanish for\nU \u2248 7, yielding a first-order M-I transition, as also obtained earlier for the frustrated square-lattice AF.14 On\nthe other hand, for the unfrustrated AF the band gap\nnever vanishes for any finite U . The vanishing of band\ngap at moderate U for both frustrated antiferromagnets\ndue to frustration-induced band broadening thus highlights the role of frustration in M-I transition.\nFinally, frustration and spin fluctuations are involved\nin an interesting interplay with respect to stability of\nthe insulating state. Frustration generally enhances spin\nfluctuations and magnetic disordering. It will therefore be interesting to also examine the interband selfenergy contribution which reduces magnetic order due\nto interband spectral weight transfer, and also widens\nthe band gap and thereby stabilizes the insulating state.\nThe first-order interband contribution exactly cancels for\nnegligible AF bandwidth, as for the unfrustrated AF in\nthe strong-coupling limit,14 but will survive for finite\nfrustration-induced bandwidth, thus highlighting the interplay between frustration and spin fluctuations, and\nproviding deeper insight into the nature of the Mott insulator.\n\nAPPENDIX: FERMION-MAGNON MATRIX\nELEMENT IN THE STRONG-COUPLING LIMIT\n\nWe show that to leading order in the U/t \u2192 \u221e limit,\nthe intraband fermion matrix elements reduce to order\nt/\u2206, and the fermion-magnon matrix element explicitly\nreduces to order t, as within the t \u2212 J model.\nFor the magnon energy and magnon amplitudes in the\ny \u2032 and z \u2032 directions we have\n\u03c9q = 3JS[(1 \u2212 \u03b3q )(1 + 2\u03b3q )]1/2\n3JS\nYq2 =\n(1 + 2\u03b3q )\n4\u03c9q\n3JS\nZq2 =\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3q )\n4\u03c9q\n\"\n#\n\u221a\nqx\n1\n3\ncos qx + 2 cos\ncos\nqy .\nwhere \u03b3q =\n3\n2\n2\n\n(A.1)\n\nFor the lower (\u2212) and upper (+) bands, the fermion\namplitudes given in Eq.
