The resulting state of matter has been a\nlongstanding puzzle. Until recently it was believed to be an amorphous state in\nwhich the crystal would break into \"crystallites\"2. But a different theory3 predicts\nthe existence of a novel phase of matter: the so-called Bragg glass, which is a\nglass and yet nearly as ordered as a perfect crystal. The 'lattice' of vortices that\ncan contain magnetic flux in type II superconductors provide a good system to\ninvestigate these ideas4. Here we show that neutron diffraction data of the vortex\nlattice in type II superconductors provides unambiguous evidence for a weak,\npower-law decay of the crystalline order characteristic of a Bragg glass. The\ntheory\n\nalso\n\npredicts\n\naccurately\n\nthe\n\nelectrical\n\ntransport\n\nproperties\n\nof\n\nsuperconductors; it naturally explains the observed phase transitions4,5,6 and the\ndramatic jumps in the critical current7,8 associated with the melting of the Bragg\n\n\f2\n\nglass. Moreover the model explains experiments as diverse as X-ray scattering in\ndisordered liquid crystals9,10 and conductivity of electronic crystals11,12.\nAfter the Bragg glass was first proposed3 its existence was supported by further\nanalytical13,14,15 and numerical16,17 calculations. However, up to now experimental\nevidence for this phase has been indirect. For instance, the presence of a Bragg glass\nexisting as a stable thermodynamic phase is expected to impose a universal phase\ndiagram for type II superconductors3,18,19 - and similar experimental phase diagrams have\nindeed been observed in a large variety of compounds4,5,6. Moreover, recent transport\nmeasurements in BiSrCaCuO20 are consistent with the Bragg glass predictions21,3. But\ngiven the complexity of these materials it is quite difficult to rule out other\ninterpretations of the data. To decide unambiguously on the nature of the vortex solid, it\nis necessary to use an imaging technique able to probe directly the topology of the\nsystem. Even if decoration and imaging experiments show large regions free of\ndislocations22 or well ordered structures when the lattice is set into motion23,24, these\nregions are still too small to provide an unambiguous signature of the Bragg glass: the\nexpected power law divergence of the Bragg peaks. Diffraction experiments such as\nSmall Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS)\n\n25,26,27,28\n\ncan be performed at larger magnetic\n\nfields, and can thus bring the scale at which disorder becomes relevant down to the\nexperimental resolution. When properly analyzed SANS experiments are thus an ideal\nmethod for deciding on this issue.\nThe experiments we report here were performed on a large single phased\n(K,Ba)BiO3 crystal (mass a 300mg, T c a 23K). This compound has the advantage of\nbeing totally isotropic enabling us to avoid complications due to anisotropy such as a\npossible 3D-2D crossover. Our experiments were performed on the D11 line at the\nInstitut Laue Langevin - Grenoble. Neutrons are coherently diffracted by the flux lines\nwhen the Bragg condition is fulfilled. In order to study the positional order of the vortex\nlattice, it is necessary to measure the correlation functions perpendicular to the vortices\n\n\f3\n\n(that is in the detector plane). However, the poor experimental in-plane resolution (a\nfew lattice constants) does not allow to probe these correlations directly. The solution is\nto measure the correlations along the vortex lines which can, on the contrary, be probed\nwith good accuracy and are directly related to the in-plane correlations through the\nelastic constants. The sample is thus rocked through the Bragg angle (by an angle w) and\nthe diffracted intensity is integrated in the detector plane, giving the so-called rocking\ncurve. The scattering geometry is shown in the top panel of Fig.1. In the vicinity of a\nwavevector K0 the integrated intensity is then related to the structure factor S(q)\nthrough : I(w) = F2\u00da dqx \u00da dqy S(qx,qy,K0w) where F is the standard form factor of a single\nvortex29. The rocking curves obtained at 2K for K0 a 31/2/2.2p/a0, where a0 is the vortex\nlattice spacing are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1. The most direct way to check for\nthe existence of the Bragg glass would be to deconvolute the experimental resolution and\ndirectly check the predicted3 power law decrease of S(q). In superconductors, the\nintensity in the rocking curve tails is too weak to do this reliably. Fortunately as we will\nshow, this power law decay can also be obtained from the magnetic field dependence of\nthe rocking curves which turns out to provides an unambiguous evidence for the\nexistence of the Bragg glass.\nAs shown in Fig.1, I/F2a0 is field independent below a magnetic field H*~ 0.7T\nbut rapidly collapses at higher fields. However, despite this strong reduction of the\nintensity at the Bragg angle (i.e. of S(qz=0)) the half width at half maximum of the\nrocking curves s remains magnetic field independent ~ 0.18\u00b0; this value is close to the\nexperimental resolution and remains constant up the highest magnetic field. This is a\nvery striking result because the London theory predicts that the area under the rocking\ncurve (Fig. 1) should remain roughly constant. A similar decrease of the diffracted\nintensity without any broadening of the rocking curve was also observed25 in\nBiSrCaCuO and attributed to a 3D-2D crossover. This explanation however cannot hold\nin the perfectly isotropic (K,Ba)BiO3 system.\n\n\f4\n\nHow can this unusual behavior be understood? Let us first recall that for a\nperfect crystal, the finite experimental resolution (in momentum Dq~ 1/x) would\ntransform the ideal delta-function peak of the structure factor at K0 into a broadened\npeak of height xd and half width 1/x, (where d is the spatial dimension). If the positional\norder in the system is not perfect but decays over the characteristic length scale Ra (for\nwhich displacements are of the order of the lattice spacing (that is u(Ra)~a0)) the\nobserved Bragg peak remains determined by the experimental resolution as long as x <\nRa. However, the structure factor will become dependent on the decay of the\ntranslational order in the system for x > Ra. This will then allow us to distinguish\nbetween an amorphous system full of dislocations and the Bragg glass. In the first case,\nthe translational order decays very rapidly beyond Ra (for example exponentially with\nthe distance) leading to a peak of height Rad and half width in momentum 1/Ra (the\ninfluence of the experimental resolution is negligible in this case); a decrease in Ra will\nthus lead to a decrease of the height of the peak and a broadening of the peak. The\nsituation is very different in the Bragg glass. Indeed, in this case the positional order\ndecays only weakly beyond Ra (as a power-law of the distance with an exponent h ~ 1).\nThe same power law decay is predicted3 perpendicularly and parallel to the vortices and\nthe corresponding characteristic lengths R az and Raxy are connected through\nRaz = Raxy c44 / c 66 (where the cii are elastics constants). In the absence of any\nexperimental limitation this would lead3 to power-law divergent Bragg peaks for qAE0 :\nS(q) ~ 1/qd-h. In a real experiment however, x suppresses this divergence and the shape\nof the peak is then controlled both by Ra (in the appropriate direction) and x.\nOur calculation shows that, for x > Ra, the structure factor (and hence the\nrocking curve) has the form shown in Fig. 2. The most important point is that, for d \u2265 h,\nthe width at half maximum of the peak remains entirely given by the experimental\nresolution 1/x for both Ra > x and Ra < x whereas the height of the peak S(qz=0) is\nproportional to Rah for Ra < x. In the Bragg glass, a decrease in Ra thus leads to a\n\n\f5\n\ndecrease of the diffraction peak without any broadening . As shown in Fig.1, this\nbehavior is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for H > H* ~ 0.7T (for H <\nH* Ra > x and the intensity remains constant). We note that such an unusual collapse of\nthe rocking curve is intrinsically related to the power law behavior of S(q) and could not\nbe observed for any faster decay of the positional order. Moreover, because the rocking\ncurves measure the diffraction along the z direction, one has to set d=1 in the above\nexpressions and this behavior thus imposes that h \u2248 1 = d (the half width at half\nmaximum s is again expected to increase as a0/ Ra for (h-d) log(x/ Ra) > 1) in excellent\nagreement with the Bragg glass model3 (h ~ 1-1.2) as well as numerical simulations17.\nThe collapse of the rocking curve without any broadening is thus direct proof of the\nexistence of the Bragg glass.\nIn order to further test the consistency of this explanation, we have extracted the\npositional correlation length R az from the data, using the Bragg glass formula for the\nintensity (I(w=0)/F2 ~ Raz). The unknown overall normalization of the intensity is fixed\nby the condition that Raz ~ x = 1/(K0 s) ~ 50 a0 when the intensity starts to depend on\nthe magnetic field. The field dependence of R az is plotted in Fig. 3. Because, for H >>\nHc1 (where Hc1 is the lower critical field) increasing the field is equivalent to increase the\neffective disorder in the system, the observed decrease of I(w=0)/F2 is in good agreement\nwith the expected decrease of Raz. The solid line in Fig. 3 corresponds to a 1/B3/2\nvariation for Raz, which is consistent with the calculated dependence of R az on the\nmagnetic field B using a simple elastic description for the vortex lattice19. The intensity\nfinally drops rapidly towards zero at a field Bm lying close to the onset of the second\npeak in magnetization measurements, thus confirming the theoretical interpretation of\nthe second peak in terms of Bragg glass 'melting'. Moreover, neutron data give a very\nreasonable value for the positional correlation length at the transition : R az (here of the\norder of Raxy) ~ 20 a0. As shown on Fig.3, this interpretation can also be applied to\nBiSrCaCuO. Indeed, similar behavior is observed in the two systems provided that the\n\n\f6\n\nfield axis is renormalized by the field for which the diffracted intensity vanishes (this\nmoreover shows that there is only one relevant parameter: Bm, which is directly related\nto Ra(0) that is the residual amount of disorder in the system).\nThe Bragg glass theory also explains the puzzling behavior of the measured\ntemperature dependence of the intensity I (Fig. 4). As shown, the 1/l4 dependence of\nthe intensity expected in the standard London model (I ~ F2) only provides a very poor\nagreement with the experimental data using a classical two-fluid model for temperature\ndependence of the magnetic penetration length l(T) (dotted line). This discrepancy was\nalso pointed out in YbaCuO (ref 26) and remained unexplained. The neutron data can be\nfitted by introducing a phenomenological modification of the temperature dependence of\nthe penetration length. However, such a strong deviation from the classical model has\nnot been observed in the l(T) deduced from muon spin resonance relaxation data26. This\nshows that besides being an ad hoc fit to the data, such a modification of l(T) does not\nin fact contain any physical meaning. As muons are mostly sensitive to the behavior of\nindividual vortices, the deviation observed in neutron data can be directly related to the\nlong range correlation in the vortex lattice.\nIndeed, in the Bragg glass model, an additional temperature dependence arises\nfrom Ra(T) which is expected to vary as (Lc/x02)3 in the elastic theory (where x0 is the\nsuperconducting coherence length and Lc the collective pinning length which describes\nthe strength of pinning). Assuming that pinning is related to fluctuations in the critical\ntemperature (the so-called d-Tc pinning model) Lc \u03bc x02/3 and the resulting temperature\ndependence is plotted on Fig. 4 (dashed line). As shown, this yields very reasonable\nagreement with the experimental data without any adjustable parameter.\n\n\f7\n\n1\n\nLarkin, A. I.

Data were taken at 2K for different magnetic fields. The\nneutron beam (of wavelength 10A) was approximately parallel to the [111] direction of\nthe crystal. The sample has been cooled in a slightly oscillating field (of the order of 5 %\nof the dc field) in order to obtain a good in plane orientational order. w is the angle by\nwhich the sample is rocked away from the Bragg angle qB (q being the angle between the\nneutron beam and the magnetic field \u2013upper panel for the scattering geometry). The\nsolid lines are Lorentzian distribution fits to the data with constant width at half\nmaximum s ~ 0.18\u00b0 (similar fits can be obtained using Gaussian distributions). Those\ndata show that the diffracted intensity (rocking curves) collapse without any broadening\nabove ~0.7T.\n\n\f11\n\nS(q) a I/F 2\nRahxd-h\nRad\n\n-1/Ra\n\n-1/x\n\n1/x\n\n1/Ra\n\nq z = K 0w\n\nFigure 2: Bragg glass predictions for the angular dependence of the neutron diffracted\nintensity. In this phase the positional order is expected to decay with an exponent h\nbeyond some characteristic length scale Ra. x is the experimental resolution. The arrows\nindicate the values of S(q) for q =0 and 1/Ra respectively. If the disorder increases (Ra\ndecreases), the height of the peak decreases as Rah but the peak does not broaden since\nthe half width at half maximum is always given by the experimental resolution 1/x and\nnot 1/Ra. Such behavior can only be observed if h ~ d (the dimensionality of the system)\nand is thus intrinsically related to the weak decay of the correlation functions. The\nheight of the peaks gives a direct measure of the characteristic length Ra. To make the\nconnection with Fig 1, one should set d=1 due to the integration of the diffracted\nintensity in the detector plane and q should be replaced by qz. As done in Fig 1, because\nqz=K0w an extra normalization factor a0 is necessary to ensure that K0\u222bI(w)dw=\u222bS(q)dq\n(note that the experimental resolution is constant in angle).\n\n\fI(q=0)K /F ~ R /a (a.u.)\n\n12\n\n0\n\n2\n\naz\n\n0\n\nexperimental resolution\nRa z ~ x\n\n(K,Ba)BiO\n\n3\n\nBiSrCaCuO\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nH/Hm\n\nFigure 3: Magnetic field dependence of the positional length R az for (K,Ba)BiO3 and\nBiSrCaCuO (ref 24) crystals. In the Bragg glass model R az is directly related the\nmaximum of the diffracted intensity (intensity at the Bragg angle): Ra ~ I(w =0)/F2. The\nx axis has been renormalized to the field Hm above which the diffracted intensity\ndisappears. The solid line corresponds to a 1/B2 dependence for R az as expected from a\nclassical elastic theory. The horizontal dotted line is the limit above which R az becomes\nlarger than the experimental resolution x ~ 50a0 in (K,Ba)BiO3. The intensity drops\nrapidly towards zero at Hm probably reflecting the proliferation of dislocations at the\norder-disorder transition\n\n\f13\n\n1\n\nI(T)/I(0)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nT(K)\n\nT\n\n25\nm\n\nFigure 4: Temperature dependence of the maximum of the neutron diffracted intensity in\na (K,Ba)BiO3 crystal. The intensity (I) at the Bragg angle has been normalized to its\nvalue at T=0K. The dotted line is the 1/l4 dependence expected in the London theory.\nAs shown the data rapidly deviate from this simple dependence. The dashed line is the\nBragg glass prediction (for Ra < x) for which I is expected to be proportional to\nRa(T)/l4(T). The order-disorder transition temperature can be obtained at 0.4T as I\ntends towards zero at Tm ~ 20K (arrow).\n\n\f"}
