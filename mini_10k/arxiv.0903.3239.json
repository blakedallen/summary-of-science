INTRODUCTION\n\nA significant fraction of baryons in the universe\nare expected to be in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic\nMedium (WHIM). Numerical cosmological simulations\n(e.g., Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001; Cen & Ostriker 1999) predict\nthat somewhere around 30-40% of all baryons exist in\nthis phase, characterized by electron temperatures between 105 and 107 K. This shock-heated gas primarily is\nlocated in large-scale filaments and sheets in the cosmic\nweb, strung between clusters of galaxies. Observations\nof this gas (if collisional ionization is the correct interpretation) have been made in Ly\u03b1 and OVI absorption\n(Tripp et al. 2008; Danforth & Shull 2005, 2008), and\nalso are likely detectable in UV absorption lines and Xray lines of OVII and OVIII (Nicastro et al. 2005). Detection of these so-called \"missing baryons\" is critical to\nunderstanding the matter content of the universe.\nRecently it has been suggested that the WHIM\ngas may be detectable using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich\nEffect (SZE) (Hern\u00e1ndez-Monteagudo et al. 2006;\nHallman et al. 2007; Afshordi et al. 2007). The SZE is\na consequence of cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nphotons being inverse Compton scattered to higher\nenergy by hot electrons. This upscattering creates a low\n1 National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics\nPostdoctoral Fellow\n2 Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy, Department of\nAstrophysics and Planetary Sciences, University of Colorado at\nBoulder, Boulder, CO 80309; hallman, burns@casa.colorado.edu\n3 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI; oshea@msu.edu\n4 Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, University\nof California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093; mnorman@cosmos.ucsd.edu\n\nfrequency decrement in the CMB, and a corresponding higher frequency increment (for review, see e.g.,\nRephaeli 1995; Birkinshaw 1999; Carlstrom et al. 2002).\nThe SZE is most typically discussed as it relates to\nobservations of clusters of galaxies, since the very hot\n(\u223c 108 K) gas there is an effective source of high velocity\nscattering electrons. Detections and analysis of known\ngalaxy clusters have been made by SZE telescopes\n(e.g., LaRoque et al. 2006; Halverson et al. 2008) and\na recent blind search using the South Pole Telescope\n(SPT) has detected previously unknown galaxy clusters\n(Staniszewski et al. 2008).\nInvestigators have attempted to estimate the SZE signature of galaxy groups\n(Moodley et al. 2008) and have made weak detections\nof supercluster gas in Corona Borealis (Battistelli et al.\n2006; G\u00e9nova-Santos et al. 2005). In addition, much\nwork has been done to study the possibility of using\nthe kinematic SZE to determine both cluster peculiar\nvelocities (Rephaeli & Lahav 1991; Haehnelt & Tegmark\n1996; Aghanim et al. 2001) and the overall bulk velocity\nfield (e.g., Kashlinsky & Atrio-Barandela 2000).\nRecent work suggests that filaments in large-scale\nstructure, because of their long path lengths and correlated velocities, may have a unique angular power signature in the SZE (Atrio-Barandela et al. 2008). In this\npaper, we show that the SZE may contribute a detectable\nsignal from the WHIM gas, observable with extensions\nto the sensitivity of current and upcoming surveys (e.g.,\nSPT, Planck Surveyor) over relatively small angular areas. We examine the contribution of the filamentary\nWHIM to the angular power spectrum of both the kinematic and the thermal SZE.\n\n\f2\n1.1. The Relative Strengths of Thermal and Kinematic\n\nSZE\nThe SZE can be separated into two spectrally distinct\neffects, one which results from the scattering of the CMB\nby the electrons at the thermal velocity in the gas, and\nthe other resulting from the bulk line-of-sight velocity of\nthe gas (kinematic SZE). Typically for the purposes of\nclusters of galaxies, the kinematic SZE (kSZE) can be\nconsidered a small perturbation on the full SZE signal.\nHowever, in the cooler WHIM gas the relative strength of\nthe kSZE increases, becoming comparable to the thermal\nSZE (tSZE). The reason for this is the different dependency of the kSZE and tSZE on the physical properties of\nthe gas. Indeed, the effects should be comparable when\nthe bulk radial velocity of the gas is roughly equal to\nthe average thermal velocity of the electrons in the gas.\nThe thermal SZE signal, characterized by the Compton\ny parameter\nZ\n\u03c3T kB\nne Te dl\n(1)\ny=\nme c2\ndepends linearly on ne and Te (i.e., is proportional to the\nthermal pressure), while the kinematic SZE, characterized by\nZ\n\u03c3T\nb=\nvr ne dl\n(2)\nc\ndepends linearly on electron density and the line-of-sight\npeculiar (radial) velocity of the gas. For the kSZE, a\nnegative radial velocity (toward the observer) results in a\npositive \u2206T/T. For the purposes of this work, we study\nthe SZE signals at 150 GHz (2.1 mm), the frequency\nwhere the thermal SZE signal has its maximum decrement against the CMB. For the kSZE, the relative temperature shift, \u2206T /T , is independent of frequency, and\nis equal to the value of b. The tSZE value for \u2206T /T is\n\u0012 x\n\u0013\ne +1\n(\u2206T /T )tsze = y x x\n\u22124 ,\n(3)\ne \u22121\nwhich at 150 GHz is equal to \u2212y. Here x = h\u03bd/kT .\nThe thermal SZE is subject to relativistic corrections,\nwhich can be important for very hot (> 10keV ) clusters\n(Itoh & Nozawa 2004).\nIf we take the ratio of b/y, the relative strength of the\nSZE temperature perturbations at 150 GHz, for a given\nparcel of gas we get\nb\nme c vr\n.\n=\ny\nkB Te\n\n(4)\n\nThis expression can be written as\nvr /(100km/s)\nb\n= 0.197\n.\ny\nTe /(107 K)\n\n(5)\n\nA similar calculation is shown in Birkinshaw (1999). For\na radial velocity of 100 km/s, and a gas temperature of\n5 \u00d7 107 K (a temperature typical of clusters), this ratio\nis around 4 percent. But in a gas having the same radial velocity but a reduced temperature, say a value of\nT = 106 K, the ratio is roughly 2. Therefore, for million\ndegree gas with a bulk velocity of 100 km/s along the\nline of sight, the magnitude of the kSZE component is\ntwice as large as the tSZE. One caveat is that kSZE can\n\nFig. 1.- Light cone projection for the low-density WHIM (LDW)\nfor the thermal SZE. LDW is defined as 105 < T < 107 K and\n0 < \u03b4 < 50. Field spans 10x10 degrees.\n\nbe either positive or negative, thus could cancel out the\ntSZE in some instances. It is possible for the kSZE to be\nzero when the gas has no peculiar line-of-sight velocity.\nIn addition, gas in cosmological filaments is of relatively\nlow density. However, this gas tends to be more spatially\nextended, thus there can be very long path lengths, creating a stronger SZE signal. We should note that \u2206T /T\nfor the tSZE is frequency dependent, and on the decrement side at 30 GHz (where interferometers like CARMA\noperate), \u2206T /T is twice the value of y, while the kSZE\nhas no frequency dependence. Thus at lower frequencies,\nthe ratio of \u2206T /T between kSZE and tSZE is a factor of\n2 lower than the b/y indicated above.\nIt is also perhaps important to note that calculations\nby Fox & Loeb (1997) and Yoshida et al. (2005) for example, show that in hot gas, the electron temperature\nmay have a non-negligible equilibration time with the\n(hotter) temperature of the ions in the post-shock regions\nin filaments. A systematically low electron temperature\nimpacts the thermal SZE signal directly, as it is linear\nwith Te . The kSZE is unaffected, as it is independent of\nTe .\nIn any case, it is intriguing that the kSZE may serve to\nboost the tSZE signal of the WHIM gas significantly, perhaps aiding in its detection in a statistical sense through\nall-sky surveys at the SZE decrement maximum. While\nit is sometimes advantageous to separate the kSZE and\nthe tSZE by their spectral signatures in order to measure\neach effect individually, here we also attempt to take advantage of their (sometimes) additive effect in order to\naid in the statistical detection of the WHIM gas.\n2. SIMULATIONS\n\nThe main results shown in this work are from analysis\nof the Santa Fe Lightcone, described in Hallman et al.\n(2007). Briefly, this N-body/hydro cosmological simula-\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2.- Light cone projection for the LDW for the kinematic\nSZE.

The calculation is initialized at z=99 using a\nEisenstein & Hu (1999) power spectrum with n = 1.\nThe cosmological parameters are \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9b = 0.04,\n\u03a9CDM = 0.26, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7, and \u03c38 = 0.9. We\nsimulated a cubic volume of dimension 512h\u22121 comoving\nMpc with a root grid of 5123 computational zones and\nseven levels of adaptive refinement using the criteria of\nbaryon and dark matter density. We use 5123 dark matter particles, resulting in a dark matter mass resolution\nof \u22487.3\u00d71010M\u2299 .\nThe light cones are made by stacking 27 slices of the\nsimulation data, correcting for their angular scale as a\nfunction of their physical size, and taking random projection axis selections and projection translations to get\nmultiple realizations of the light cone for the given cosmology. These slices are projections at various redshifts\nspanning the range 3.0 > z > 0. For this work we use\n100 realizations of the light cone with random projection\naxes and shifts. The final light cone images for this work\nhave image resolution of 40962 for an effective resolution of 8.8\u2032\u2032 per pixel. From our previous work, we have\nshown that this simulation effectively resolves the halo\nmass function down to roughly 5\u00d71013M\u2299 . For more\ndetails see Hallman et al. (2007).\n2.1. Low-Density WHIM Projections\n\nFor this particular work, we have used projections of\nthe thermal and kinematic SZE. We have made light\ncones from projections of the kSZE and tSZE from\ngas within the WHIM temperature range (105 \u2212 107 K),\nand also limit the gas overdensity to the regime from\n0< \u03b4 <50 (where \u03b4 indicates the overdensity (gas +\ndark matter) ratio with respect to \u03c1c ).

In\na \u039bCDM cosmology with the currently favored parameter values, this is more than a factor of 3 below the\nvirial overdensity. Therefore the gas we are probing is\ndefinitely in the filaments and sheets (and even voids).\nIn our tests of overdensity threshold, we find very weak\ndependence of the result when changing the overdensity\ncutoff by a factor of a few. We hereafter refer to this gas\nas the low-density WHIM (LDW). The LDW light cone\nprojections for the thermal and kinematic SZE are shown\nin Figures 1 and 2. One reason for the safety factor in\nselected overdensity is that in any simulation, we have a\nfinite mass resolution, which means that low mass halos\nare unresolved gravitationally. Therefore the overdensity\nachieved in the unresolved halos is likely lower than the\ntypical virial value. The main purpose for our choice of\nlimits, therefore, is to ensure that we are fully in the filamentary WHIM regime. Figure 3 shows a projection of\na low redshift slice made with the gas properties defined\nin this way, illustrating how this regime of temperature\nand density captures the filamentary gas.\n3. DETECTING THE SIGNATURE OF THE WHIM WITH\nPLANCK AND SPT\n\nWe first investigate the contribution of the WHIM gas\nto the SZE signal in a sky survey. The image histograms\nfor the LDW SZE projections are shown in Figure 4.\nThese histograms are from the raw light cone images,\nwhich have a native angular resolution of 8.8\u2032\u2032 . It is clear\nthat the addition of the kSZE creates a strong increase\nin the number of pixels above a given flux decrement.\nThe analogous plot for the full SZE projections (for all\ngas in the simulations) is shown in Figure 5. In this case,\nthe total SZE is dominated by the tSZE, and the kSZE\nis a small perturbation on that signal. These figures illustrate the argument in Section 1.1 very nicely, i.e. the\nkSZE is a much more important contributor in the lower\ndensity, cooler gas than it is in the hotter cluster gas.\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 4.- Histogram of one of the LDW light cone images in\nCompton y and/or b parameter. Red line indicates the thermal\nSZE, blue is for the kinematic SZE, black is the total of the two,\nan indicator of the total value of \u2206T /T at the thermal decrement\nmaximum (\u2248 2.1mm/150GHz).\n\nFig. 5.- Same as Figure 4, but for the full light cone image\nincluding clusters. Red is thermal SZE, black total combined signature, and blue is kinematic SZE. Note the relative lack of importance of the kSZE at the high decrement end. This tail is from\nclusters, where the kSZE is relatively unimportant.\n\nNext, we add the tSZE and kSZE maps, and smooth\nthe light cone maps with a Gaussian kernel where the\nfull width half maximum is equal to the beam size at\nthe thermal SZE decrement maximum for both Planck\nSurveyor and the South Pole Telescope. We can add the\ntwo effects for these purposes (adding y and b) since the\nrelative \u2206T /T at the tSZE maximum decrement is equal\nto the value of \u2212y, and the relative temperature shift\ndue to the kSZE is independent of frequency. Under the\nassumption that our observation would be made at 150\nGHz, this argument is valid.\nFinally, we add a white noise component with the rms\nequal to the expected sensitivity of the two surveys, make\na histogram of image values, and attempt to fit a Gaussian to the histogram. If the signal is below the sensitivity of the survey, the fit to a Gaussian should be excellent.\nIf the fit is poor, then a signal has been detected. Figure 6 shows the mean \u03c72 values for the Gaussian fitting\nfor 100 realizations of the LDW-only light cone. It is\nclear that for a four-fold increase in sensitivity in SPT's\nsurvey, the LDW makes a real contribution to the sky\nsignal, and at even a factor of 2 increase (to 5\u03bcK rms\n\nFig. 6.- The mean value of \u03c72 from a Gaussian fit to the image\nhistograms for 100 light cone realizations with error bars indicating\nthe range for 90% of the realizations plotted against the factor by\nwhich sensitivity has been increased (i.e. noise rms reduced) over\nthe expected value for each survey. A \u03c72 value greater than 1\nis indicative of a poor fit to a Gaussian, and that the filaments\ncontribute signal to the maps. Blue is for Planck, black for SPT.\n\nper beam), there might be a marginal detection. Figure 7 shows the result of increasing sensitivity (reducing\nnoise) in the full (10 x 10 degree) images using the SPT\nbeam size. A sample image histogram for SPT is shown\nin Figure 8.\nFor Planck, non-Gaussianity appears marginally at a\nfactor of 8 increase in sensitivity (0.75 \u03bcK per beam),\nand is clearly there at a factor of 10 increase. The difference between these two surveys which favors SPT is the\nangular scale of the beam. SPT has about an arcminute\nbeam at this frequency, while Planck's is 7.1\u2032 . The scale\nof the filaments (of order Mpc), which is similar to the\ncluster scale, is a better match to the SPT beam size for\nmost redshifts. A sample image histogram from an image smoothed to Planck resolution with its Gaussian fit\noverlaid is shown in Figure 9.\nWe again note that our simulations assume temperature equilibrium between the ions and electrons, which\nis probably not achieved on short timescales in this gas.\nThis result should reduce the thermal SZE signature by\nsome amount which is uncertain. A survey would have\nto be at least as sensitive as what we have described in\norder to have WHIM contribution to the tSZE signal.\n3.1. Methods for Detecting WHIM Gas in SZE Sky\n\nSurveys\nWhile it appears clear that at a given survey sensitivity the WHIM gas in filaments (LDW) contributes signal\nabove the noise, it is not initially obvious how such a measurement would be made. In the real universe, we do not\nhave maps of the filaments only, and the lack of redshift\ndiminution in the SZE results in a significant amount of\nconfusion in the survey fields. Therefore, separating the\ncontribution of WHIM from that of clusters and groups\nof galaxies may seem an insurmountable challenge.\nHowever, it is possible that filaments have a unique angular power signature, such that their contribution could\nbe identified separate from clusters. There are significant\ndifficulties with this approach, as illustrated in Figures\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 9.- Gaussian fit to the image histogram for WHIM light\ncone with Planck beam and a factor of 8 increase in sensitivity\nover that expected in Planck's large survey. This is equivalent\nto a \u2206T rms of 0.75 \u03bcK per beam.\n\nFig. 7.- Four images of the full 10x10 degree field of the LDWonly light cones in total \u2206T /T smoothed with a 1\u2032 Gaussian to simulate SPT's beam. Upper left: Image with 10\u03bcK rms white noise\nUpper right:image with 5\u03bcK rms, lower left: image with 2.5\u03bcK\nrms, lower right: 1.25\u03bcK rms.\n\nFig. 8.- Gaussian fit to the image histogram for WHIM light\ncone with SPT beam and a factor of 4 increase in sensitivity\nover that expected in SPT's large survey. This is equivalent to\na \u2206T rms of 2.5\u03bcK per beam.\n\n10 and 11. These figures show the relative power for a\nfull simulated sky map and for the low-density WHIM\nonly projections. Figure 10 shows this difference for the\ntSZE, Figure 11 for the kSZE. While there is a significant\namount of gas in the WHIM phase in simulations, they\ncontribute very little to the angular power spectrum, particularly in the tSZE. The angular power at the peak is\n\u223c3 orders of magnitude lower in the WHIM for the tSZE,\nand more than a full decade lower for the kSZE. More\ntroublesome is that the shapes of the power spectra are\nvery similar. We should note that for the kSZE, some\n\nsmall changes in the stacking algorithm must be made\n(compared to Hallman et al. (2007)) in order to maintain continuity of structures along the projection depth.\nThis means that no shifting in light cone stacking takes\nplace unless the depth in projection is equal to the depth\nof the full simulation box.\nIndeed, at these large angular scales the SZE is\nswamped by the primordial CMB anisotropies, and the\nWHIM contributes a very tiny fraction to the power at\nthese multipoles. What is important to note in these\nplots is that the prediction of previous investigators of\na bump in the angular power spectrum of the kSZE\nat l \u2248 400 (Atrio-Barandela et al. 2008) as a result\nof filaments in the low redshift universe is apparently\nabsent from our result. This is unfortunate, as this\nbump would create a unique angular signature which\none could use to identify the WHIM in filaments. The\nAtrio-Barandela et al. (2008) work uses an analytic formalism to describe the distribution of gas in filaments,\nand the distribution of the filaments themselves. It is\nnot clear which assumptions of their model are not reproduced in our simulations, and could account for the\ndiscrepancy. We will explore this further in later sections.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that the relative\npower in the kSZE and tSZE as a function of gas phase\nvaries dramatically. Figure 12 shows the power spectra\nfor the full light cone maps with tSZE in black and kSZE\nin blue. Figure 13 shows the same plot for the LDW gas.\nIn this gas, the kSZE dominates at the peak and at most\nscales. This result meshes nicely with the description of\nthe kSZE/tSZE ratio in Section 1.1.\n3.2. Effect of the Low-Density WHIM on the Power\n\nSpectrum\nAside from the obvious question of whether the filamentary LDW can be directly detected in SZE surveys,\nthere is the related key issue of the WHIM filaments\ncreating a contaminating signal that might be misinterpreted. For instance, shifts in the SZE angular power\nspectrum might result in shifts in fitted cosmological parameters (e.g., the value of \u03c38 ). Therefore, it is important to understand the WHIM contribution to the power\n\n\f10-11\n\n10-11\n\n10-12\n\n10-12\n\n10-13\n\n10-13\n\nl(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0\n\nl(l+1)Cl/2\u03c0\n\n6\n\n10-14\n\n10-14\n\n10-15\n\n10-15\n\n10-16\n\n10-16\n\n10-17\n\n10-17\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100\n\nl\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nl\n\nFig. 10.- Angular power spectra of the thermal SZE from 100\nlight cone realizations with ranges (dotted) within which 90% of\nour realizations fall.

Note that the kSZE has more angular power than the\ntSZE for the gas in the LDW phase.\n\nspectra.\nTo investigate this question, we have taken a ratio of\nour full simulation light cone projection power spectra to\npower spectra of images where the projection of the LDW\nSZE has been removed. In all cases we have smoothed the\nimage with a 1\u2032 Gaussian to represent the beam of SPT\nat 150 GHz. We have again done this for 100 light cone\nrealizations, and plotted the 90% cosmic variance scatter\nin the following figures. Figure 14 shows this ratio as a\nfunction of multipole number for the thermal SZE. While\nthere is significant cosmic variance at large scales, the\nmean value (solid line) is a change of order 3% maximum.\nAt high l, the ratio is of order 1%. For the kSZE, the\neffect is more important. The lines on Figure 15 show\nthe mean and 90% scatter of the power spectra ratios.\nThe removal of the WHIM lowers the overall power in\nthe map by as much as \u22488% at l \u2248 100 \u2212 400. Though\ndeclining in contribution to higher l, at l = 1000 the\neffect is still roughly 5%.\n\n3.3. WHIM Power in the kSZE\n\nWhile this effect is not obvious when looking at the\nWHIM and total power spectra of the images separately, the range of l where the LDW contributes to\nthe power spectrum is broadly consistent with the results of Atrio-Barandela et al. (2008). Though the cosmic variance using different light cones is quite large,\nwith a large sky area one should see the effect. In\nAtrio-Barandela et al. (2008), they find a filamentary\ncontribution which moves to lower l as z decreases, as is\nexpected due to the reduced angular diameter distance.\nOur lowest z defined in these light cones is 0.05, where\nthe filamentary contribution in Atrio-Barandela et al.\n(2008) appears to peak between 1500 < l <2000. We\nsee the change at lower l, where they see the contribution coming from z < 0.05. We address this issue further\nbelow.\nWe predict a filamentary WHIM angular power signature consistent with Atrio-Barandela et al.

The removal\nof the LDW results in a reduction of the power at low multipoles.\nThe effect has a maximum of \u2248 8% at l \u2248 100 \u2212 400.\n\nThere are some differences in the two types of analyses\nwhich may be important. First, Atrio-Barandela et al.\n(2008) integrate the SZE signature of their filamentary\nmodels up to relatively high overdensity (300-500), which\nin our simulation is outside the filamentary regime. In\naddition, our light cones calculate the SZE signature\nusing a stack of simulation boxes in which the smallest redshift we use is z=0.05. That limit means that\nlow redshift filaments, which are largest on the sky, are\nnot represented fully by our method. In their model,\nthe contribution of filaments is a strong function of redshift, low z being most important. Also, in contrast to\nAtrio-Barandela et al. (2008) we represent a 10x10 degree patch of sky, while their prediction is for an all sky\nsignature.\nTo explore the potential contribution of foreground filaments, we have added to our light cones a set of 5 images\n\nspanning the redshifts from 0.05 to 0.00 with a \u03b4z of 0.01\n(simulating the work of Atrio-Barandela et al. (2008)).\nFor this we have used a smaller simulation of a cubic volume of dimension 128h\u22121Mpc with 2563 root grid zones\nand 5 levels of dynamic refinement with refinement criteria similar to those used in the original simulation. This\nadditional simulation is necessary since we have much\nfiner \u03b4z spacing, and can then simulate the contribution\nof low redshift filaments to the kSZ images. For these\nlow redshift slices this volume is more than sufficient,\nsince very little volume is actually sampled in a fixed angular area of 100 square degrees at z < 0.05. We have\ngenerated 5 fully independent realizations of the slices at\nthe lowest z range described above, and added them to\nimages analyzed in earlier sections. We then repeat the\nanalysis of taking a ratio of power spectra with and without the LDW filaments. The result is shown in Figure\n16, and it shows that the addition of low z filaments does\nnot substantively change the results. They simply do not\ncontribute significant power to the overall sky signature\nin the kSZE.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile it appears clear that the LDW gas in filaments\ncontributes a real signal to the thermal and kinematic\nSZE above a certain survey sensitivity, it is unclear how\none can take advantage of this effect to \"detect\" the\nWHIM gas. The signal associated with the WHIM in\nthe SZE is washed out by the dominant contributions of\nthe hotter, denser gas in clusters and groups, and lies\nin a wavenumber regime dominated by primary CMB\nanisotropies. The unique angular signature that the filaments contribute may make their detection in the power\n\n\f8\nspectrum possible. The WHIM filaments also make a\ncontribution to the kSZE power spectrum that could result in contamination to studies that look to constrain\ncosmology by the kSZE.\nAdditionally, it is possible that higher order moments,\nsuch as the angular bispectrum or trispectrum (spherical\ntransform of the three- and four-point correlation functions)(e.g., Kogo & Komatsu 2006) of the images, may\nbe more promising measurements of filamentary SZE signatures. If the combined SZE signal of filaments is nonGaussian (e.g., Yoshida et al. 2001), a three or four-point\ncorrelation may show a unique signature of filaments. We\nleave this analysis to later work.\nThis simulation has only adiabatic physics and shocks;\nno non-gravitational physics has been included. However, in this density and temperature regime, cooling\ntimes are typically quite long compared to the Hubble time. Also, what are usually considered to be the\nprimary non-gravitational heating mechanisms (stars,\nAGN) in the universe are found preferentially in high\ndensity regions. Therefore, the adiabatic approximation is accurate for this particular problem. However,\nif episodes of galaxy outflow heating have taken place\nin this low density gas (as may be indicated by its nonnegligible metallicity), then corrections may have to be\nmade. Additionally, the spatial resolution in the low density gas in this particular simulation is not very high.\nOur root grid simulation zones have spatial extent of 1\nMpc, and gas at between overdensity of 1 and 50 has\nspatial resolution of between 250 and 500 kpc per zone.\nAlso important is our mass resolution, which means that\nlow mass (under 5 \u00d71013 M\u2299 ) clusters are gravitationally under-resolved. Therefore, gas which is in filaments\nin our simulation may properly belong in collapsed structures like galaxies. It is not immediately clear which direction these effects would push the results, since higher\nspatial resolution of the filaments would result in higher\ndensity, increasing the WHIM SZE signal, and higher\nmass resolution should result in less gas in the WHIM\nphase overall. We will study these questions in later papers.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nLow-density WHIM gas in filaments contributes signal\nto 100+ square degree sky surveys if the sensitivity is\nsufficiently high. This contribution becomes important\nfor an SPT-like telescope survey when the sensitivity is\nincreased by as little as a factor of 2-4x. In the filaments,\n\nthe kinematic SZE becomes quite important relative to\nthe thermal SZE, particularly in the frequency regime of\nmaximum thermal SZE decrement (150 GHz) where SZE\nsurveys are being performed. In some phases of the gas,\nthe kSZE can be the dominant contributor to the SZE\nsignal at that wavelength.\nThe presence of WHIM gas in filaments modifies the\nkinematic SZE angular power spectrum by \u22488% at l >\n100 \u2212 400. Our results are broadly consistent with the\nprediction of Atrio-Barandela et al. (2008) of the l \u2248 400\nbump in the kSZE angular power spectrum due to filaments. The thermal SZE is less affected by the presence of filaments. The modification of the kSZE angular\npower spectrum could be a source of error in cosmological parameters derived from the kSZE. It is likely that\nthis bias can be corrected using numerical simulations\nlike those described in this work. The unique angular\nsignature of the WHIM filaments in the kSZE may allow\nfor WHIM detection using kSZE surveys provided systematic effects can be accounted for with high accuracy,\nand a clever method of isolating the effect from that due\nto clusters can be devised.\n\nBWO and MLN have been supported in part by NASA\ngrant NAG5-12140 and NSF grant AST-0307690.
