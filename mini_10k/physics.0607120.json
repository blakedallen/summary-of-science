A. Gonoskov* and I. A. Gonoskov**\nInstitute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Nizhny Novgorod 603950, Russia\nWe present an approach to numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation and other\nparabolic equations by the split-step technique with fast Fourier transform, which suppresses the\nbackreflection of waves from the grid boundaries with any specified accuracy. Most importantly, all known\nmethods work well only for a narrow region of incident waves spectrum, and the proposed method provides\nabsorption of any wave whose length is large enough in comparison with the size of absorption region.\nPACS number(s): 02.70.-c\n\n*\n\nElectronic address: argon1@mail.ru\nElectronic address: gonoskov@ufp.appl.sci-nnov.ru\n\n**\n\nFor a number of reasons, the split-step technique with fast\nFourier transform (FFT) is often most efficient for numerically\nsolving the parabolic equations and the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, as a special case. Here the multidimensional grid appears to be closed. In a 2D case, for example,\nwe have a toroidal topology. This means that if some wave packet\ncomes to the grid boundary it will pass through and appear at the\nopposite side. However, when solving a physical problem, one\noften deals with a part of infinite space. This raises the problem of\nabsorbing the backreflection of all waves from the grid\nboundaries. Traditionally, this problem is solved by using an\nimaginary potential in some absorption region at the grid\nboundary (see, for example, [2]). Parameters of the imaginary\npotential are chosen experimentally, depending on which waves\nshould be absorbed. Recent paper [3] has reported some\nmodification of this method, which, however, does not make it\nfree from a significant drawback. It appears that this method\nprovides relatively good results only for a narrow region of\nincident waves spectrum. Short waves pass through the absorption\nregion, whereas long waves are reflected. Here the size of the\nabsorption region should considerably exceed the absorbed\nwavelength. In addition, parameters of the imaginary potential\nneed to be re-chosen for each new problem. In this paper, we\npropose a technique that provides absorption of any wave whose\nlength is large enough in comparison with the size of the\nabsorption region. In the multidimensional case it means that one\ncan use this method to absorb waves with different angles of\nincidence. The analogous problem for electromagnetic waves has\nbeen already solved with perfectly matched layer (PML) technique\n[5]. Most importantly, in the proposed method it is possible to\nderive a precise formula for calculating errors and to determine the\napplicability domain.\nFor simplicity, we will consider a one-dimensional case. Let\nus assume a one-dimensional grid, on which we solve the timedependent dimensionless Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u2202\u03c8 (x, t )\n1 \u22022\n=\u2212\n\u03c8 (x, t ) + U (x, t )\u03c8 (x, t ) .\n\u2202t\n2 \u2202x 2\nThe calculations are made using the split-step technique [1]:\n\nIf we use in this grid an imaginary potential in the form, e.g.,\n\uf8eb x\u2212 X0 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7 , then we obtain an absorption\nU ap (x ) = i \u22c5 m \u22c5 cos 2 \uf8ec\uf8ec \u03c0\nL0 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nof incoming wave packet [2]. It appears, however, that by\nchoosing parameter m , we can have satisfactory absorption\nonly for a narrow band of the wave packet spectrum,\ncorresponding to waves with a wavelength exceeding L0 . Short\nwaves pass through the absorption region, whereas long waves\nare reflected. This gives rise to an idea of a method in which the\nabsorption coefficient m is dependent on the wavelength. Let\nus\nexpand\nthe\nwave\nfunction\nin\nthe\nregion\nL0\nL0 \uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef X 0 \u2212 2 ; X 0 + 2 \uf8fa in a Fourier integral:\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nL0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u222bC\n\n\u03c8 ( x, t ) =\n\u2212\n\nL0\n\nk\n\n(t )e ik (x\u2212 X 0 )dk .\n\n(3)\n\n2\u03c0\n\nSince equation (1) is linear, the absorption should also be linear.\nIn a general case, it may be described by the following formula:\n1 \u2202C k\n=S k ,\n(4)\nC k \u2202t\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\nwhere S k\n\nis a function that determines the suppression\n\nmethod. However, we will consider a specific case with the\nfollowing considerations. The propagation velocity of waves\nwith a wave number k is proportional to k . The wave packet\nwhich has the mean velocity k will pass through the absorption\nregion in time proportional to k \u22121 and according to (4) its\namplitude will exponentially decrease while it passes through\nthe region. If we want to affect equally all wave packets we\nshould choose the rate of amplitude decreasing proportional to\nk . Therefore, the absorption rate of C k should be proportional\n\n(1)\n\nto k . Thus we obtain the following form of the equation\ndescribing the absorption:\n1 \u2202C k\n(5)\n= \u2212\u03b2 k ,\nC k \u2202t\n\n\uf8eb \u2212ik 2 \u2206t \uf8eb \u2212iU ( x ,t ) \u2206t\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\u02c6\uf8ece\n2 F\n2 \u03c8 (x, t )\uf8f7 \uf8f7 + O \u2206t 3 ,\n\u00d7 F\u02c6 \u22121 \uf8ec e\n(2)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nwhere F\u0302 is the Fourier transform operator. All waves traveling to\nthe boundary of the grid should be absorbed and, besides, the\nwave function should be affected only in a small region. Let us\nconsider a region of length L0 with the center at point X 0 , at\nwhich incoming broad-spectrum wave packet has to be absorbed.\n\nwhere \u03b2 is an absorption rate coefficient. In this approach,\nhowever, we will have a sharp jump because of the\ndisagreement between wave function values at points at the\nabsorption region boundaries, resulting in the formation of a\nbroad spectrum of wave packet, although in the whole space the\nwave packet traveling to the absorption region may have a\nnarrow spectrum. Thus, the spectrum will contain harmonics of\nthe waves non-existent in the whole space. It is clear, that the\nsuppression of a wave may be interpreted as a generation of the\n\ni\n\n\u03c8 (x, t + \u2206t ) = e\n\n\u2212iU ( x ,t + \u2206t )\n\n\u2206t\n2\n\n( )\n\n\fsame wave with the opposite phase. Thus, absorption of nonexistent waves will efficiently lead to waves generation and,\nconsequently, to weak absorption, as we observed in numerical\nexperiment. To avoid this, it is reasonable to affect only a part of\nthe wave function by using a \"mask\" evenly smoothing the edges\nto zero:\n\u03c8 (x, t ) = \u03c8 (x, t ) \u22c5 (1 \u2212 f (x )) +\u03c8 (x, t ) f (x ) ,\n(6)\nwhere function f (x ) (mask) should smoothly decay from unity to\nzero at the boundaries of the absorption region. The suppression\ntechnique should be used for Fourier expansion coefficients of the\nfunction \u03a6(x, t ) = \u03c8 (x, t ) f (x ) . For best results, the function f (x )\nshould have as narrow spectrum as possible. This condition is\n\uf8eb x\u2212 X0 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7 . Now it is obvious that if\nfulfilled for function cos 2 \uf8ec\uf8ec \u03c0\nL0 \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n1 \u2202C k\n= \u2212 m instead of equation (5), we will\nwe use equation\nC k \u2202t\n\nobtain the imaginary potential method. The only parameter \u03b2 in\nequation (5) is responsible for the wave damping factor. The\nintegration of (5) gives:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \uf8ec \u03c8i \uf8f7\n\u03b2~\nln\uf8ec\n,\n(7)\nL0 \uf8ec \u03c8 f \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nwhere \u03c8 i and \u03c8 f are amplitudes of wave packet before and after\npassing through the absorption region. Thus, the parameter \u03b2\nshould be chosen based on the required accuracy of calculations. It\nwas found in numerical experiments (Fig. 1) that the absorption\nresult is well described by formula (7) for absorbed wavelengths\nnot exceeding a certain value that decreases with the parameter\n\u03b2.\nFurther we will describe in brief the algorithm scheme. During\neach iteration, in addition to the step operation of the split-step\nmethod, the following procedures should be performed:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nPresent the wave function \u03c8 (x, t ) as a sum of two parts by\napplying the mask in the absorption region:\n\u03c8 ( x, t ) = \u03a8 ( x, t ) + \u03a6 ( x, t ) ,\nwhere:\n\u03a8 (x, t ) = \u03c8 (x, t )(1 \u2212 f (x )) ,\n\u03a6 ( x , t ) = \u03c8 ( x, t ) f ( x ) .\nFind Fourier coefficients using FFT for \u03a6(x, t ) in the\nabsorption region:\n\u03a6 ( x, t ) =\n\nn= N\n\n2\n\n\u2211\n\nCn (t )e\n\nin\n\n2\u03c0\n(x \u2212 X 0 )\nL0\n\nthe absorption region for different wavelengths. So, we need to\ngenerate the test wave with different values of the wavelength.\nBelow we discuss how to solve this problem. The problem\nof wave generation is equal to the absorption problem. The wave\nfunction should be affected in some region (\"generation\" region)\nby using the absorption method for difference between the wave\nfunction and the analytically described test wave. For this\npurpose, during each iteration, the following procedures should\nbe performed:\n1.\n\nIn the wave generation region, determine the difference\nbetween the wave function and the analytically described\ntest wave:\nikx \u2212 i\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nk2\n\nt\n\n2 ,\nG (x, t ) = \u03c8 (x, t ) \u2212 Ae\nwhere A and k are parameters of the test wave that\ncorresponds to the dispersion relation for equation (1) in\nfree space.\nApply the absorption method in the generation region for\nG ( x, t ) :\n\nG (x, t ) \uf8e7absorption\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\u2192 G (x, t ) .\nObtain the wave function in the generation region after\ngeneration:\nikx \u2212 i\n\nk2\n\nt\n\n2 .\n\u03c8 (x, t ) = G (x, t ) + Ae\nIt is clear, that in the generation region these procedures make\nthe wave function close to the test wave. As the test wave\ncorresponds to the dispersion relation for equation (1) in free\nspace, the test wave goes out of the generation region. So we get\nthe wave generation. These procedures also provide absorption\nof all other waves which come to the generation region.\nBelow we will present the results of comparison of this\nmethod with the imaginary potential method. To compare the\nmethods, the test wave was generated using the imaginary\npotential method. Some time after the start of generation, a\npicture was set in, where the transmitted and reflected waves\ncould be distinguished. Below we plot (Fig. 1) the dependences\nof the sum of squares of reflection and transmission coefficients\nof the test wave (T and D) on the log of the ratio of the\nabsorption region length L0 to the wavelength \u03bb for the both\nmethods (the imaginary potential method with three different\nvalues of the parameter m and the proposed method with\ncoefficients \u03b2 = 0.48 and \u03b2 = 0.69 ).\n\n.\n\nn = \u2212 N +1\n2\n\n3.\n\nPerform one iteration for coefficients Cn :\n\n4.\n\nCn (t + \u2206t ) = Cn (t ) \u22c5 e\nPerform the inverse FFT:\n\u03a6 ( x, t ) =\n\nn= N\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n2\u03c0\nn \u2206t\nL0\n\n2\n\n\u2211 Cn (t + \u2206t )e\n\nin\n\n.\n\n2\u03c0\n(x \u2212 X 0 )\nL0\n\n.\n\nn = \u2212 N +1\n2\n\n5.\n\nObtain the wave function in the absorption region after\nabsorption:\n\n\u03c8 ( x, t ) = \u03a8 ( x , t ) + \u03a6 ( x, t ) .\n\nNote that due to the FFT the speed of this procedure, as well as the\nwhole split-step method with FFT, is proportional to V log 2 (V ) ,\nwhere V is the number of matrix elements.\nSince the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the absorption methods\nare linear, for comparison it is enough to determine the\ncoefficients of reflection and transmission of a test wave through\n\nFIG. 1.

Note that the\nimaginary potential method works very poorly for high and low\nfrequencies with the exception of the narrow region centered at the\ndefinite value of L0 \u03bb , depending on amplitude m , whereas the\nproposed method is free of this feature and in the high-frequency\nregion it provides stable absorption of waves, corresponding to\nformula (7). This stable absorption begins already for wavelengths\nthat only 1.3 \u2013 1.5 times exceed the length of the absorption region\n(for \u03b2 = 0.48 ).\nThe comparison with the approach proposed in [3] (referred\nbelow as \"filtered\") is shown in Fig. 2. Here a is a filter\nabsorption coefficient, b is an imaginary potential coefficient. It\ncan be also seen that the proposed method, by appropriate choice\nof the parameter \u03b2 , can be made better than the filtered method\nfor all wavelengths.\n\nFIG. 2.

Filtered method \u2013 dotted lines; proposed method \u2013\nfull lines.\nLet us now discuss additional possibilities provided by the\nproposed method for solving the scattering problem. The method\ncan be easily generalized for a multi-dimensional case. For this we\nshould use the one-dimensional procedure independently for every\nline, column, etc., for each dimension. However, when\nnumerically solving the scattering problem, one can significantly\nimprove the results by further modifying the proposed technique.\nThe scattering problem is put as follows. For simplicity, we\nwill consider a 2D case. We assume that there is a 2D grid with a\ncertain distribution of potential that comes to a constant value at\nthe grid boundary. In the example given below, the potential has\nr\n1\nthe form U (r ) = r . An incident wave, corresponding to the\nr\ndispersion relation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nr\nr\nr r\n1\n\u2202\u03c8 (r , t )\n(8)\ni\n= \u2212 \u2207 2\u03c8 (r , t ) + U (r )\u03c8 (r , t )\n2\n\u2202t\nin free space, hits the potential from the left. When numerically\nsolving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (8), it is required to calculate in\nthe whole space the wave function of the electron scattered by the\npotential.\nThe numerical experiment can be arranged as follows.\nInitially, the wave function of the electron is zero on the grid. At\nthe grid boundary, this function is affected by using the above-\n\ndescribed method for the difference between the wave function\nof the electron and the analytically described plane wave, which\nwe want to make the incident wave. As a result, we will get a\ngeneration of the incident wave at the left boundary. It is clear\nthat first the incident wave front will enter the grid and then it\nwill be changed when passing the potential. Some time later, the\nfronts of transmitted and reflected waves will reach the grid\nboundary and the probability distribution will become static.\nThe time dependence will persist only as a phase change.\n\nFIG. 3. Probability distribution in 2D scattering problem. (a)\n\u2013 the imaginary potential method; (b) \u2013 the proposed method.\nThe result of the numerical experiment conducted using the\nimaginary potential technique is shown in Fig. 3(a). One can see\ndark regions at the upper and lower boundaries, which get wider\nto the right boundary. These perturbations occurring above and\nbelow correspond to reflections from the upper and lower\nboundaries. This is due to the following fact. Far away from the\ncenter of the potential, the analytic solution for the scattering\nproblem is the sum of two parts, a scattered wave and the\nincident plane wave. If the potential decays insufficiently fast,\nthe incident plane wave has an additive to the phase, which is\nr\nproportional to log of r (for Coulomb potential, see [4]) even\nfar away from the center of the potential. As a result, at the\nupper and lower boundaries we suppress a wave that differs\nfrom a required one only by phase. This corresponds to\ngeneration of one more wave that differs only by phase. As a\nresult of the interference of these waves, we obtain the\ndistribution shown in Fig. 3(a). To avoid this, it is possible, for\nexample, not to absorb a wave traveling along the upper and\nlower boundaries, i.e., to absorb only a scattered wave. This\nmeans that in the proposed method waves that are long in the\ntransverse direction should not be absorbed. To achieve this, one\nshould use expression:\n\n\f\uf8f1\uf8f4 k , k > 1\n1 \u2202C k\n= \u2212\u03b2 \uf8f2\nC k \u2202t\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 0, k \u2264 1\n\n(9)\n\nrather than the expression (5), thereby performing absorption with\nwavelength discrimination. Thus there will be no absorption for\ncoefficients C k with k lower or equal to unity which correspond\nto waves that are the longest in the transverse direction. The\ndistribution provided by this modification is shown in Fig. 3(b).\nWe can see that there are no dark regions, which were in Fig. 3(a).\nThe figure shows that the area of the grid where the wave function\nis free of parasitical distortions is about two times larger than in\nthe case of imaginary potential method Fig. 3(a). That means that\nthe use of this modification of the proposed method instead of the\nimaginary potential method for the 2D scattering problem allows\nto get the same results on two times smaller grid. Moreover, in the\n3D scattering problem this modification allows to use four times\nsmaller grid.\n\n[1] M. D. Feit, J. A. Fleck, and A. Steiger, J. Comput. Phys. 47,\n412 (1982).\n[2] J. L.

It is important that after\nappropriated choosing of the parameters it works better than\nwell-known imaginary potential method for any wave packets\nwhich should be absorbed. Also this method allows to\nselectively affect the different harmonics of the wave packet.\nThis feature can be very useful for some physical problems.\nBesides, the proposed method is very good for waves\ngeneration. In general, the proposed technique allows not only to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the absorption region, but to\nresearch some new problems when numerically solving the\nparabolic equations.\nAuthors would like to thank M.
