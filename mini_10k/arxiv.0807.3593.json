We compare it to the known outer\nbounds and show that the outer bound presented is at least as\ntight as the existing bounds.\n\nProof: The inequalities follows immediately from Fano's\ninequality and the following identifications:\n\u01741i = Y1i\u22121\n\u01742i = Y2n i+1\nU = M1\nV = M2 .\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThere has been a series of outer bounds presented to the\ncapacity region of the broadcast channel [2], [3], [4]. All\nthe bounds follow from the use of Fano's inequality and the\nCsiszar sum lemma[1]. In this note, we present another outer\nbound along these lines that is at least as tight as the known\nbounds.\n\nII. T WO RECEIVER\n\nWe then set W1 = (\u01741 , Q), W2 = (\u01742 , Q), where Q is\nan independent random variable chosen uniformly at random\nfrom the interval {1, ..., n}.\nThe last four equalities are a direct application of the\nCsiszar sum lemma [1] and the proof is omitted. The first two\nequalities follow from Fano's inequality and the independence\nof M1 and M2 ; and the proof is again omitted. The third\nequality follows as follows:\n\nBROADCAST CHANNEL WITH PRIVATE\nMESSAGES ONLY\n\nThe following lemma presents an outer bound for the capacity region of the two receiver discrete memoryless broadcast\nchannels.\nLemma 1: Consider the set of all random variables\nU, V, W1 , W2 such that (U, V, W1 , W2 ) \u2192 X \u2192 (Y1 , Y2 ) for a\nMarkov chain. Further assume that U and V are independent;\nand the distribution (U, V, W1 , W2 , X, Y1 , Y2 ) satisfies the\nfollowing equalities:\nI(U ; Y1 |W1 ) = I(U ; Y1 |V, W1 )\nI(V ; Y2 |W2 ) = I(V ; Y2 |U, W2 )\nI(U ; V |W1 , W2 , Y1 ) = I(U ; V |W1 , W2 , Y2 )\nI(W2 ; Y1 |W1 ) = I(W1 ; Y2 |W2 )\nI(W2 ; Y1 |U, W1 ) = I(W1 ; Y2 |U, W2 )\nI(W2 ; Y1 |V, W1 ) = I(W1 ; Y2 |V, W2 )\n\n(1)\n\nI(W2 ; Y1 |U, V, W1 ) = I(W1 ; Y2 |U, V, W2 ).\nThen the set of rate pairs R1 , R2 satisfying\nR1 \u2264 I(U ; Y1 |W1 )\nR2 \u2264 I(V ; Y2 |W2 )\nconstitutes an outer bound to the capacity region of the discrete\nmemoryless broadcast channel.\n\nI(U ; V |W1 , W2 , Y1 ) \u2212 I(U ; V |W1 , W2 , Y2 )\nn\n1X\nI(M1 ; M2 |Y1i , Y2ni+1 ) \u2212 I(M1 ; M2 |Y1i\u22121 , Y2ni )\n= lim\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=1\n\n1\n= lim\n(I(M1 ; M2 |Y1n ) \u2212 I(M1 ; M2 |Y2n ))\nn\u2192\u221e n\n=0\nThe last step follows from Fano's inequality.\nRemark 1: We note the following divergence from the\nnormal presentation of the outer bounds: the absence of a\nsum rate constraint, as well as the presence of a number of\nequalities.\nWe will compare this bound to the following existing\nbound1 for the same setting.\nBound 1: The union of rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) that satisfy the\nfollowing inequalities\nR1 \u2264 I(U, W ; Y1 )\nR2 \u2264 I(V, W ; Y2 )\nR1 + R2 \u2264 min{I(W ; Y1 ), I(W ; Y2 )} + I(U ; Y1 |W )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |U, W )\nR1 + R2 \u2264 min{I(W ; Y1 ), I(W ; Y2 )} + I(U ; Y1 |V, W )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |W ).\n1 The equivalence of the bounds can be observed from the fact that for the\nidentifications in [2] I(U ; V |W, Y1 ) = I(U ; V |W, Y2 ), and this implies the\nbound presented in [3].\n\n\f2\n\nover all p(u)p(v)p(w|u, v)p(x|u, v, w)p(y1 , y2 |x) forms an\nouter bound to the capacity region.\nClaim 1: The region specified by the lemma 1 is at least\nas tight as the region specified by Bound 1.\nProof: We need to show that any (R1 , R2 ) satisfying the\nconstraints of Lemma 1 is contained in the region described\nby Bound 1. To show the inclusion, we set W = (W1 , W2 ).\nObserve that\n\nR2 \u2264 I(V ; Y2 |W )\nR0 + R1 \u2264 I(T, U ; Y1 |W1 )\n\nR0 + R2 \u2264 I(V ; Y2 |T, W1 , W2 ) + I(T, W2 ; Y1 |W1 )\nR0 + R1 + R2 \u2264 I(U ; Y1 |T, V, W1 , W2 ) + I(T, V, W1 ; Y2 |W2 )\n\nUsing the equality\nI(V ; U |W1 , W2 , Y2 ) = I(V ; U |W1 , W2 , Y1 )\n\nR0 + R1 + R2 \u2264 I(V ; Y2 |T, U, W1 , W2 ) + I(T, U, W2 ; Y1 |W1 )\nR0 + R1 + R2 \u2264 I(U ; Y1 |T, V, W1 , W2 ) + I(T, W1 , W2 ; Y1 )\n\nit is easy to see that\n\n(2)\n\nTherefore the two sum rate constraints in Lemma 1 are\nidentical.\nHence it suffices to prove that\nI(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(V ; Y2 |W2 )\n\u2264 I(W1 , W2 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 , W2 )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |U, W1 , W2 ).\n(The other one obtained by replacing I(W1 , W2 ; Y1 ) with\nI(W1 , W2 ; Y2 ) follows similarly. To get the symmetric expression, just use (2).)\nObserve that\nI(U, W1 , W2 ; Y1 ) + I(V ; Y2 |U, W1 , W2 )\n= I(W1 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(W2 ; Y1 |U, W1 )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |U, W1 , W2 )\n= I(W1 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(W1 ; Y2 |U, W2 )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |U, W1 , W2 )\n= I(W1 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(V, W1 ; Y2 |U, W2 )\n= I(W1 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(W1 ; Y2 |U, V, W2 )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |U, W2 )\n(a)\n\n= I(W1 ; Y1 ) + I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(W1 ; Y2 |U, V, W2 )\n+ I(V ; Y2 |W2 )\n\n\u2265 I(U ; Y1 |W1 ) + I(V ; Y2 |W2 ),\nwhere (a) follows from the following:\nI(V ; Y2 |U, W2 ) = I(V ; Y2 |W2 ).\n\nIII.

Further assume that\nT ,U , and V are independent; and the distribution\n(U, V, W1 , W2 , X, Y1 , Y2 ) satisfies the following equalities:\nI(T ; Y1 |W1 ) = I(T ; Y2 |W2 )\nI(T ; Y1 |W1 ) = I(T ; Y1 |V, W1 ) = I(T ; Y1 |U, W1 )\n= I(T ; Y1 |U, V, W1 )\nI(T ; Y2 |W2 ) = I(T ; Y2 |V, W2 ) = I(T ; Y2 |U, W2 )\n= I(T ; Y2 |U, V, W2 )\n\n(3)\n\nI(U ; Y1 |W1 ) = I(U ; Y1 |V, W1 ) = I(U ; Y1 |T, W1 )\n= I(U ; Y1 |T, V, W1 )\nI(V ; Y2 |W2 ) = I(V ; Y2 |U, W2 ) = I(V ; Y2 |T, W2 )\n= I(V ; Y2 |T, U, W2 ),\nI(B1 ; B2 |A, W1 , W2 , Y1 ) = I(B1 ; B2 |A, W1 , W2 , Y2 )\n\n(4)\n\nholds for all A \u2286 {T, U, V }, B1 \u2286 {T, U }, B2 \u2286 {T, V }, and\nI(W2 ; Y1 |A, W1 ) = I(W1 ; Y2 |A, W2 )\n\n(5)\n\nholds for all A \u2286 {T, U, V }.\nThen the set of rate tuples (R0 , R1 , R2 ) satisfying\nR0 \u2264 min{I(T ; Y1 |W1 ), I(T ; Y2 |W2 )}\nR1 \u2264 I(U ; Y1 |W1 )\nR2 \u2264 I(V ; Y2 |W2 )\nconstitutes an outer bound to the capacity region of the discrete\nmemoryless broadcast channel.\n\n\f3\n\nFurther, just as in Lemma 2 one can restrict X to be a\ndeterministic function of (u, v, t, w1 , w2 ) and also assume that\nthe marginals of U, V, T are uniform.\nProof: T = M0 is the only new identification as\ncompared to Lemma 1. The arguments for this lemma are\nsimilar to those of Lemma 1 and are omitted.\nClaim 2: The region presented by Lemma 2 is at least as\ntight as the New-Jersey outer bound.\nProof: Again the arguments are similar to those of Claim\n1 and are omitted.\nIV.
