This paper proposes a method for constructing an experimental power beam pattern (PB) of RATAN600 based on the sample of NVSS sources observed in the process of a deep sky survey near local zenith. The\ndata obtained from observations of radio sources at \u03bb7.6 cm in nine bands of the survey (the 2002 and 2003 sets)\nare used to construct vertical PB of the telescope at rather large offsets from the central horizontal section of\nthe PB (\u00b136\u2032 ). The experimental PBs obtained using different methods are compared and the root-mean-square\ndeviations of the experimental PB from the corresponding computed PB are determined. The stability of the\npower beam pattern in its central part (\u00b16\u2032 ) during the RATAN-600 Zenith Field (RZF) survey (1998\u20132003) and\nthe accuracies of the fluxes of the sources observed within the framework of this survey and included into the\nRZF catalog are estimated [1].\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis paper continues a series of works dedicated to the\nstudy of the power beam pattern of the radio telescope RATAN-600. The PB was analyzed numerically\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], using methods of optical modeling\n[10, 11, 12], and also by observing bright cosmic sources\n[13, 14, 15]. These studies give a comprehensive understanding of the PB in terms of intensity and polarization.\nThe final reconciliation of the computed and observed PBs\nwas carried out in our papers [9, 15]. We showed that the\nadditional allowance for diffraction effects in the aperture\nof the primary mirror and for the finite vertical size of\nits reflective elements [9] brings about a good agreement\nbetween the computed and measured PB within a large\nsolid angle down to a level of 0.5% of the maximum beam\nintensity [15]. We perform numerical simulations to study\nthe effect of the error distribution in the settings of the\nreflective elements of the primary mirror on the structure\nof the PB in distant sections. These computations were\nexperimentally corroborated in a series of observations of\nreference sources in 2001 and 2002 [15].\nThe power beam pattern of RATAN-600 requires such\na detailed study because of its complex structure and because the shape of the PB depends significantly on the elevation of the source observed. In observations performed\nwith a single sector of the antenna the PB varies from\nthe knife-edge beam (in observations at the horizon) to\nSend offprint requests to: E.K.Majorova, e-mail: len@sao.ru\n\na virtually pencil beam - in observations of near-zenith\nsources. Near the local zenith the power beam pattern has\na narrow beam whose half-power beam width (HPBW) is\ndetermined by the horizontal aperture of the sector, and\nextended scattered background whose intensity decreases\nas 1/y in the vertical plane. The extent of this background\nin the vertical plane depends on the vertical size of the reflective panel and may be as large as 100 HPBW. This\nscattered background is concentrated in the sky in two\nsectors located symmetrically with respect to the central\nsection with the summits at the maximum of the PB and\nwith angular sizes of 90o . This \"fan\" of scattered background of the PB gradually \"shrinks\" (the angular size of\nthe sectors decreases) with decreasing elevation at which\nthe antenna is focused (the elevation H of the source observed) and at low elevations it transforms into a narrow structure extended in the vertical direction - the PB\ntransform into knife-edge beam.\nTemirova [13, 14] and Majorova and Trushkin [15]\nstudied experimentally the PB of RATAN-600 using the\nradio-astronomical method described by Kuz'min and\nSolomonovich [18]. This method consists in measuring\nthe antenna temperatures of a cosmic source as it passes\nthrough different sections of the PB. The so-called \"point\"\nsources are measured whose angular sizes are much smaller\nthan the width of the PB. In this case, the response of the\nantenna at the output of the radiometer coincides with the\nPB in the given horizontal direction up to a constant factor. During observations the transit curves of the source\n\n\f2\n\nMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\nare recorded while passing through various horizontal sections of the PB shifted by dH in declination with respect\nto the central section. The PB is normalized to the maximum of the antenna temperature of the source in the\ncentral section (dH = 0). The dependences of the normalized antenna temperature of the source on dH give the\nvertical power patterns Fv of the radiotelescope.\nThis method allows the two-dimensional PB to be\nmeasured with high accuracy. However, to measure the\npower pattern within a sufficiently large solid angle, one\nhas to observe many transits of a bright cosmic source\nacross a fixed PB. The time required to perform such a\nstudy increases with the degree of detail the power pattern\nis to be measured. Therefore such measurements of the PB\ncannot be made too often. At the same time, the deep sky\nsurveys performed with RATAN-600 over many years require good knowledge of the PB within large solid angles.\nThe more sensitive is the survey, the more reliable must\nbe the information about the state of the beam pattern\nthe time the observations are performed. Good knowledge\nof the shape of the power beam pattern in distant sections and of the vertical PB of the telescope are needed\nto determine the fluxes from the sources and estimate the\ndeclinations of the latter. In addition, information on the\nstability of the PB in time is of great importance.\nNote that the fluxes of individual sources crossing the\ncentral section of the PB are determined using the \"reference\" sources with well-known fluxes and with declinations close to that of the source studied. The information\non the central section of the PB is quite sufficient when\nperforming observations in this mode. When performing\ndeep sky surveys one has to know the PB at least within\nthe declination band of the survey.\nThe power beam pattern can be computed using the\navailable codes [9] or based on the results of experimental studies performed in 2001 \u2013 2002 [15]. However, the\nFv (dH) dependences can also be inferred from the observational data of the survey proper. In this paper we propose to use to this end the transit curves of the sources\nof the RZF survey with known fluxes whose declinations\ndiffer from that of the central sky section of the survey.\nOne can select a sufficient number of \"point\" sources with\nwell-known coordinates and fluxes from a single 24-hour\nsky section with more than 30000 radio sources passing\nwithin the envelope of the reflective panel when observed\nat \u03bb7.6 cm to construct the two-dimensional power beam\npattern of the radio telescope [16, 17].\nThis method of the PB measurement may be less accurate compared to the technique described by Kuz'min\nand Solomonovivh [18], because it requires a good knowledge of the fluxes of the calibration sources. However, it\nallows one to estimate the state of the power pattern at\nthe time of survey observations and does not require additional antenna time. Moreover, a comparison of the PB\nso measured with the power beam determined using other\nmethods allows one to estimate the measurement errors\nat the survey time.\n\nIn this paper we analyze the PB at the time of the\ndeep zenith sky survey performed with RATAN-600 [1].\nWe chose most of our reference sources among those steepspectrum sources from the NVSS catalog that fall within\nthe sky region of the survey.\n\n2. OBSERVATIONS\nThe RZF survey was carried out within the framework of\nthe program \"The Genetic Code of the Universe\" aimed\nat the study of spatial variations of cosmic background\nradiation and weak radio sources within the band of\nthe [19, 20] survey. Observations were performed from\n1998 through 2003 in the Northern sector of RATAN600 at the elevation of 384 (H = 87o 41\u2032 ) in the wavelength interval \u03bb = 1.0 \u00f7 55 cm. The measurement\nequipment employed consisted of the radiometric complex of antenna feed No.1. A total of eight observing\nsets were run. During the (1998.10\u20131999.02), (1999.03),\n(1999.10\u20131999.11), (1999.12\u20132000.03), and (2001.01\u201303,\n2001.10\u201311) sets observations were made in the 0h \u2264\nR.A. < 24h survey band at the declination of 384\n(Dec2000 = 41o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 ), and during the (2001.12 \u2013 2002.03)\nand (2002.12\u20132003.03) sets, in nine sections 12\u2032 apart so\nthat the total band of the \u03bb7.6-cm survey was 0h \u2264\nR.A.2000.0 < 24h , Dec2000.0 = 41o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 60\u2032 .\nIn this paper we focus on the study of the power beam\npattern at \u03bb7.6 cm. The sensitivity of the receiver is maximal at this wavelength and amounts to 2.5 mK. Of greatest interest from the viewpoint of studying the PB are the\nresults of observations made during the last two sets. For\nthe sake of brevity we refer to them as the 2002 (2001.12\u2013\n2002.03) and 2003 (2002.12\u20132003.03) sets. Observational\ndata obtained in nine sections (survey bands) \u2206\u03b4 = 12\u2032\napart in declination allow the vertical power pattern to be\nconstructed over a wide range of dH. The long time span\n(from 1998 to 2003) of the survey allows information to be\nobtained about the stability of the power beam pattern in\ntime.\nTo construct the PB, we selected from the NVSS\ncatalog mostly sources with steep spectra and \u03bb 21-cm\nfluxes exceeding 16 mJy. We converted the \u03bb 21-cm fluxes\ninto the corresponding \u03bb 7.6-cm fluxes using all the available data on the fluxes of these sources at other wavelengths as adopted from the CATS database [21, 22]. The\n\u03bb 7.6-cm fluxes of the selected sources proved to be no\nlower than 5 mJy. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio,\nwe averaged the records obtained both over individual\nsets and over groups of sets. The number of averaged\nsingle-source records in the central section of the survey\nDec2000 = 41o30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 (\u2206\u03b4 = 0) varied from 15 to 60 depending on the set. The number of averaged records did\nnot exceed five in sections \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b112\u2032 n (n=1,2,3,4) apart\nfrom the central section.\n\n\fMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\n3. REDUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF\nTHE POWER BEAM PATTERN\nWhen an unpolarized \"point\" source crosses the central\nsection of the PB its antenna temperature at the radiometer output and spectral flux density are linked by the following relation:\nP/Ta = 2k/Sef f ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant; Sef f is the effective\narea of the antenna of the radio telescope (1000 m2 ); Ta\nis the antenna temperature (K), and P is the source flux\n(W/m2 Hz).\nWhen the source crosses a section that is dH apart\nfrom the central section in declination its antenna temperature should decrease in accordance with the variation\nof the vertical power pattern Fv (dH). If the PB is measured using a single source crossing different sections of\nthe power beam, its value in a section dH apart from the\ncentral section can be computed by the following formula:\nFv (dH) =\n\n(P/Ta )dH=0\n(Ta )dH\n=\n,\n(P/Ta )dH\n(Ta )dH=0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere (Ta )dH=0 and (Ta )dH are the antenna temperatures\nof the source in the central section and in the section dH\napart from the central section, respectively.\nIf the power beam is measured using a set of sources\ncrossing different sections of the PB then to compute\nthe vertical power pattern in the dH section, one has to\nknow not only the antenna temperatures of the sources\n(Ta i )dH=0 , (Ta j )dH , but also their fluxes Pi , Pj . In this\ncase, the formula for Fv (dH) acquires the following form:\n(Pi /Ta i )dH=0\nFv (dH) =\n.\n(Pj /Ta j )dH\n\n(3)\n\nIn the observations performed in nine survey bands\nduring the 2002 and 2003 sets the antenna of the radio\ntelescope was focused on the elevations corresponding to\nthe following declinations:\nDecn = Dec3C84 \u00b1 12\u2032 n, (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\nWe estimated the dH offset for the source with declination Deci observed in nth band of the survey from the\ncentral section of this band as:\ndH = Deci \u2212 Dec3C84 \u00b1 12\u2032 n, (n = 1, 2, 3, 4).\nSufficiently bright sources were observed in several\nbands of the survey.\nTo construct the power beam pattern, we selected\nfrom all nine bands of the survey of about 140 sources\nfrom NVSS catalog with the \u03bb7.6-cm fluxes no lower than\n80 mJy, except for three sources. A total of about 35 and\n20 records for each of these sources were averaged in the\n2002 and 2003 sets, respectively.\nAfter determining the fluxes and antenna temperatures of the sources for each observing set we constructed\nthe corresponding P/Ta = f (dH) dependences. The filled\nsquares in Fig. 1 show the P/Ta ratios for the sources of\nthe sample studied located within dH = \u22124\u2032 \u00f7 4\u2032 ((a) and\n\n3\n\n(b) correspond to the 2002 and 2003 sets, respectively)\nfrom the central section. We then use the least squares\nmethod to fit the approximating curves (two- and fourdegree polynomials) to the data points obtained. These\ncurves allowed us to determine the average (P/Ta )dH=0\nratios in the central section of the power beam pattern.\nThe approximating curves are shown by the solid lines in\nFig. 1. The approximating curves yielded a (P/Ta )dH=0\nratio of 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 and 2.2 \u00b1 0.3 for the 2002 and 2003\nsets, respectively. Given the (P/Ta )dH=0 ratio, one can\nuse formula (1) to estimate the effective area of the antenna of the radio telescope during the observing period\nconsidered. The effective area at \u03bb7.6 cm with the antenna\npointed to the elevation of 384 (H = 87o 41\u2032 ) was equal to\nSef f = 1200 \u00b1 130 and Sef f = 1250 \u00b1 130 m2 during the\n2002 and 2003 sets, respectively.\nTo construct\nthe vertical PB,\nwe used the\n(P/Ta )dH=0 ratios determined from the approximating\ncurves and also the antenna temperatures (Ta i )dH and\nfluxes Pi of the sources. We computed the Fv (dH) values by formula (3). The relative standard error of the\nantenna temperatures determined from the entire sample of sources considered is equal to \u03c3Ta = 0.10 \u00b1 0.08;\nthe standard error of the inferred source fluxes is equal to\n\u03c3P = 0.16 \u00b1 0.06, and the total standard error of measurements is equal to \u03c3\u03a3 = 0.19 \u00b1 0.10. The total error\nis determined by the contributions of three components:\nerrors of interpolation of the spectra to the wavelength of\n\u03bb7.6 cm based on the results of other observations; the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and the stability of the parameters\nof the antenna system of RATAN-600.\n\n4. RESULTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF\nTHE EXPERIMENTAL POWER BEAM\nPATTERN\nThe filled squares in Fig. 2, 3 show the experimental vertical power patterns constructed based on the results of\nobservations of the sources during the 2002 and 2003 sets\nin each of the nine bands of the survey: in the central band\n(\u2206\u03b4 = 0) and in the bands \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b112\u2032 , \u00b124\u2032, \u00b136\u2032 , \u00b148\u2032\napart from the central band. The solid lines show the computed power beam patterns. Figures 4 and 5 show the halfwidths of the power beams (HP BW ) plotted versus dH\nfor the 2002 and 2003 sets, respectively (the filled squares\nand solid lines show the experimental HP BW values and\ntheoretical HP BW (dH) curves, respectively). As is evident from the plots shown, experimental data points are,\non the whole, close to the computed curves. Note that the\npoints corresponding to the experimental half-widths of\nthe PB fit the theoretical curves better than the experimental data points of the vertical power patterns (Fv ).\nThis is most likely due to the errors of the determination\nof the fluxes of the sources studied and also to the variations of the effective antenna area during observations.\nNote also that the deviation of experimental PB from the\ncorresponding theoretical one differs in different survey\nbands.

(The 2002 observing set).\nFv exceed the corresponding computed values in the domain of positive dH.\nWe used the fact that the shape of the power beam\npattern at the \u03bb7.6 cm wavelength remains virtually unchanged within the 1\u25e6 interval of source elevation to con-\n\nstruct the dependences Fv (dH) and HP BW (dH) common for all bands. The filled squares in Fig. 6 show the experimental vertical power beam Fv (dH) obtained from observations of sources out of all the nine bands of the survey\nand the solid lines show the computed PB ((a) the 2002 set\n\n\fMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\n5\n\nFig. 3. Same as Fig. 2, but for the 2003 observing set.\nand (b) the 2003 set). When constructing the power beam\nwe set the (P/Ta )dH=0 ratios equal to 2.3 and 2.17 for the\n2002 and 2003 sets, respectively. Figure 8 shows the experimental HP BW (dH) dependences obtained from the\nresults of observations of sources in all the nine survey\nbands (filled squares). The solid lines show the computed\nHP BW (dH) dependences.\nA rather large scatter of experimental PB data points\nis immediately evident from a comparison of the experimental and theoretical Fv (dH) dependences shown in\nFig. 6. Moreover, both sets exhibit somewhat asymmetric power beam. The standard error of the deviations of\nthe experimental PB from the computed PB determined\nover the entire sample of observed sources is equal to\n\u03c3 = 0.071 \u00b1 0.005 and \u03c3 = 0.068 \u00b1 0.005 for the 2002\nand 2003 sets, respectively. As for the HP BW (dH) dependences shown in Fig. 8, experimental data points of\nthe 2002 set agree very well with the theoretical curves\nthroughout the entire interval of dH values, whereas the\nexperimental data for the 2003 set agree with the theoretical curves only in the \u221210\u2032 < dH < 15\u2032 interval. To\ncompare the experimental and computed PB half-widths,\nwe compute the coefficients KHP BW that are equal to the\nratio of the experimental-to-computed power beam halfwidths. The mean coefficients KHP BW averaged over the\n\nentire sample of observed sources are equal to 1.00 \u00b1 0.08\nand 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 for the 2002 and 2003 sets, respectively.\nNote that the main contributors to the experimental\nPBs shown in Fig. 6 are the sources observed in side bands\nof the survey where measurements were much less sensitive than in the central band. These very sources provide\nthe greatest scatter of data points on the experimental\npower beam. Recall that no more than 3 \u00f7 5 records from\neach source were averaged in the bands with \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b112\u2032 n\n(n = 1, 2, 3, 4), whereas 20 \u00f7 35 records were averaged for\neach source in the central band (\u2206\u03b4 = 0). We therefore\nconstructed, in addition to the common PBs for the nine\nbands, the experimental vertical PBs constructed using\nobservations made in side bands of the survey exclusively.\nTo reduce the scatter of data points, we applied the socalled point \"densification\" procedure: we averaged the Fv\nvalues over some dH interval. The power beam patterns\nso constructed are shown in Fig. 7 by filled squares ((a) -\nthe 2002 set and (b) - the 2003 set). The standard error\nof the deviations of the experimental power beam obtained\nfrom the results of observations made in side bands of the\nsurvey with averaging over 1\u2032 -wide dH intervals is equal to\n\u03c3 = 0.030 \u00b1 0.005 and \u03c3 = 0.035 \u00b1 0.006 for the 2002 and\n2003 sets, respectively. These values proved to be close to\nthe standard error of the deviations of the power beam\n\n\f6\n\nMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\nFig. 4.

To the latter, we applied the procedure of \"densification\" of experimental points. The solid lines in the\nfigures show the computed PBs. For better visualization,\nwe plot the power beams in the same dH intervals. It is\nevident from the plots shown in Figs. 7 and 10 that the\nexperimental PSs obtained in both sets agree well with\nthe corresponding theoretical curves over the entire range\nof dH values except for the dH = 3\u2032 \u00f7 5\u2032 interval, where\nthe experimental PB runs somewhat above the computed\nPB. The results of measurements in the central band of the\nsurvey show similar deviations (Fig. 9). These distortions\nof the power beam pattern may be due to a systematic error in the elevation-angle setting of the reflective elements\nof the primary mirror and to large errors (\"outliers\") of\n\nzero settings in the elevation coordinate for a number of\nreflective panels. Such errors appeared because of the wear\nof the reflective panel mechanisms and had the same sign.\nSee [15] for a description of their effect on the power beam\npattern.\n\n5. RESULTS OF THE POWER BEAM PATTERN\nMEASUREMENTS FROM 384 SOURCE\nWe measured the vertical power patterns of the telescope\nindependently of the data for the 2002 and 2003 sets using\nthe bright \"point\" source 384 and the technique described\nin [15, 18]. This source was observed in all nine bands of\nthe survey. We normalized the curves of its transits across\nthe sections with \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b112\u2032 n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to the\nantenna temperature of the source in the central section\nof the survey (\u2206\u03b4 = 0). We computed the vertical power\npattern values by formula (2). Figure 11 shows the results\nof the measurements of the vertical power beam. Figure 12\nshows how the half-widths of the PBs depend on dH.

COMPARISON OF EXPERIMENTAL POWER\nBEAM PATTERNS OBTAINED IN THE\n1998\u20132003 OBSERVING SETS\nDuring the 2002 and 2003 sets observations were made in\nnine survey bands shifted by \u2206\u03b4 = 12\u2032 with respect to each\nother that alow the experimental BP to be constructed in\nthe interval \u221236\u2032 < dH < 36\u2032 . During the 1998 (1998.10\n\u2013 1999.02) and 2000 (1999.12 \u2013 2000.03) sets the sources\nwere observed only in the central band of the survey at\nthe declination of 384 (Dec2000 = 41o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 ). To compare\nthe experimental power beam patterns obtained in these\nobservations, we used a sample of NVSS sources (about\n80 objects) with \u03bb7.6-cm fluxes greater than 5 mJy. The\nnumber of records averaged for each source was equal to\nabout 60 for the 1998 and 2000 observations; about 40\nrecords for the 2002 observations, and about 20 for the\n2003 observations. The dH values for this sample lied in\nthe interval \u22126\u2032 < dH < 6\u2032 , i.e., we studied mostly the\ncentral part of the power beam pattern (main beam).\nWe used the technique described in Section 3 of this\npaper to construct the vertical power beams. The filled\nsquares in Fig. 15 show the experimental vertical PB\nobtained from the results of observations made in 1998,\n2000, 2002, and 2003, and the solid lines show the computed PBs. The standard error of the deviations of the\nexperimental PB from the computed PB is equal to\n\u03c3 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.02, \u03c3 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.01, \u03c3 = 0.16 \u00b1 0.02, and\n\u03c3 = 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 for the 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003 sets, respectively. The procedure of \"densification\" of data points\nreduced the standard error down to \u03c3 = 0.06 \u00b1 0.02,\n\u03c3 = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, \u03c3 = 0.06 \u00b1 0.02, and \u03c3 = 0.04 \u00b1 0.01\nfor the 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003 sets, respectively.The\nfilled squares in Fig. 16 show the experimental vertical\nPBs obtained after applying the procedure of \"densification\".\nFigure 17 shows the experimental vertical power beam\npatterns obtained from observations of 13 bright \"point\"\nsources from the NVSS catalog with the \u03bb7.6-cm fluxes\ngreater than 150 mJy. The standard error of the deviations\nof the experimental PB based on these bright sources from\nthe computed PB is equal to \u03c3 = 0.06 \u00b1 0.02 for the 1998,\n2000, and 2002 sets and \u03c3 = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 for the 2003 set.\nThese values virtually coincide with the standard errors of\nthe deviations of the experimental PBs constructed using\nthe entire sample of sources with subsequent \"densification\" of data points. Note that to construct these PBs,\nwe used sources more than half of which had fluxes in the\n5 mJy\u00a1P\u00a150 mJy interval. It follows from this that given a\nlarge number of relatively weak sources one can achieve\nthe same accuracy for the constructed experimental PB\nas in the case of using a few strong sources. However, the\nweaker are the sources, the bigger must be the sample and\nthe more records are to be averaged for each source.\n\nWe constructed the Kv (dH) dependences for the experimental PB obtained from the entire sample of sources.\nWe fit approximating lines to the resulting families of data\npoints. The entire sample yields the following values for\nthe slope of the approximating line: b = 0.021, b = 0.023,\nb = 0.012, and b = 0.006 for the 1998, 2000, 2002, and\n2003 sets, respectively. These values are close to those obtained from the results of observations of 384 and sources\nin the side bands of the survey. The coefficient that characterizes the slope of the approximating line for the dependences Kv (dH) based on observations of 13 bright sources\nis close to zero.\nTo compare the vertical PBs obtained for observations\nmade in different sets, we plot least-square-fit Gaussians\napproximating the experimental power beam patterns\nshown in Figs. 15, 16, and 17. We compare the half-widths\nof the Gaussians, G0.5 , and the parameters \u2206max characterizing the shift of the summit of the Gaussian along the\ndH-axis with respect to the coordinate origin (dH = 0).\nParameter \u2206max characterizes the shift of the maximum\nof the vertical PB with respect to the central section. We\nfound the parameters G0.5 and \u2206max to remain unchanged\nfrom on set to another: G0.5 = 4.06\u2032 \u00b1 0.10 and \u2206max =\n\u22120.024\u2032 \u00b1 0.005 irrespectively of whether we fitted the\nGaussians to the experimental power beams obtained from\nthe entire sample of sources or to those constructed using\nthe sample of bright sources exclusively. Fitting Gaussians\nto the computed PBs yielded the same G0.5 and \u2206max values - G0.5 = 4.06\u2032 \u00b1 0.10 and \u2206max = \u22120.024\u2032 \u00b1 0.005\n- thereby confirming the good agreement between experimental and computed power beam patterns.\nGiven that the standard errors of the deviations of the\nexperimental PBs from the corresponding computed PBs\nobtained from either the bright sources or from the entire\nsample virtually coincide for different observing sets, we\ncan conclude that the experimental power beam pattern\nwas sufficiently stable during the RZF survey (1998\u20132003)\nand agreed well with the computed power beam pattern\nin its central part (\u00b16\u2032 ).\n\n7. ESTIMATING THE MEASUREMENT\nERRORS OF SOURCE FLUXES IN THE RZF\nSURVEY\nThe data obtained when constructing the experimental\nPBs for the 1998\u20132003 observing sets can be used to estimate the measurement errors for the fluxes of the sources\nthat were observed during the RZF survey at 7.6 cm and\nwere included into the RZF catalog [1].\nGiven the antenna temperature of a source crossing the\nsection that is dH apart from the central section, one can\nconvert the antenna temperature of the source to its value\nin the central section. We can then use formula (1), where\nk/Sef f = (P/Ta )dH=0 , to determine the \u03bb7.6-cm source\nflux and interpolate (or extrapolate) it to \u03bb21. The source\nfluxes so determined can be compared to the fluxes given\nby the NVSS catalog. It is evident that this chain is the\ninverse of the one used to construct the experimental PB\n\n\fMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\n11\n\nFig. 13.

The ratio\nof the flux of a source with given dH (or declination) given\nin the NVSS catalog to the observed flux is equal to the\nratio of the experimental PB obtained from the results of\nobservations of this source to the computed PB in the dH\nsection crossed by the source. The standard errors of the\ndetermination of the source fluxes in the sample considered are equal to the standard errors of the deviation of\nKv from the mean value averaged over the same sample\nof sources.\nWe computed the ratios Kv both for the sample of\nsources observed in nine survey bands during the 2002\nand 2003 sets and for the sample of sources observed in\nthe central band of the survey during the 1998\u2013 2003 sets.\nThe standard errors \u03c3Kv of the deviation of Kv from its\nmean value computed from observations of sources in nine\nsurvey bands are equal to \u03c3Kv = 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 and \u03c3Kv =\n0.26 \u00b1 0.03 for the 2002 and 2003 sets, respectively. These\nstandard errors are computed for a sample of 140 NVSS\nsources with the 7.6-cm fluxes exceeding 80 mJy. We did\nnot \"densify\" the data points of the experimental PB.\nRemoving the bias in the distribution of Kv (dH) due to\nthe turn of the experimental PB relative to the computed\none reduces the standard error down to \u03c3Kv = 0.24 \u00b1\n0.02 and \u03c3Kv = 0.25 \u00b1 0.02 for the 2002 and 2003 sets,\nrespectively.\n\nThe standard error for the sample of 80 sources observed in the central survey band during the 1998\u20132003\nsets is equal to \u03c3Kv = 0.23 \u00b1 0.03 for the 1998 and\n2000 sets and \u03c3Kv = 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 for the 2002 and 2003\nsets. The 7.6-cm fluxes of these sources were no lower\nthan 5 mJy. Restricting the sample exclusively to objects\nwith fluxes above 100 mJy results in a standard error of\n\u03c3Kv = 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 for the 1998 and 2000 sets and \u03c3Kv =\n0.23 \u00b1 0.05, for the 2002 and 2003 sets. The standard error\nfor the sample of 13 bright sources is \u03c3Kv = 0.15 \u00b1 0.04,\n\u03c3Kv = 0.14\u00b10.04, \u03c3Kv = 0.16\u00b10.04, and \u03c3Kv = 0.18\u00b10.04\nfor the 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003 sets, respectively.\nThe standard errors for the observations of sources\nwhose declinations lie in the Dec2000.0 = 41o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 2\u2032\n(the band of the RZF catalog) interval are equal to\n0.15 \u00f7 0.24. They virtually agree with the source flux estimates obtained by Bursov et al. [1].\nTo sum up the results obtained, it can be concluded\nthat the standard error of the fluxes of sources observed\nduring the RZF survey at 7.6 cm lies in the (0.15 \u00f7 0.27) \u00b1\n0.05 interval and depends both on the brightness of the\nsource and on its distance from the central section of the\npower beam pattern.\n\n\f12\n\nMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\nFig. 15.

CONCLUSIONS\nWe propose a method for constructing the experimental\npower beam pattern for RATAN-600 radio telescope using\nNVSS sources with well-known coordinates and fluxes that\ncross various sections of the power beam during the deep\nsky survey.\nDuring the 2002 and 2003 observational sets the RZF\nsurvey was conducted in nine survey bands \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b112\u2032\napart. We used a rather preliminary sample consisting of\n140 sources observed during these sets to construct the experimental and vertical PBs of the radio telescope, which\nwe then compared to the experimental PBs obtained from\nobservations of 384 using the traditional method [18]. The\nstandard error of the deviations of the experimental PB\nfrom the computed one for the entire sample of observed\nsources is equal to 0.070 \u00b1 0.005. The application of the\nprocedure of \"densification\" of data points (averaging the\nFv values in a 1\u2032 interval of dH values) reduced the standard error of the deviations of the experimental PB from\nthe computed one down to 0.033 \u00b1 0.006. For sources observed in the central band of the survey, where the sensitivity of measurements was much higher than in the\nside bands of the survey, the standard error is equal to\n0.033 \u00b1 0.007 for the 2002 set and 0.050 \u00b1 0.009, for the\n2003 set (without \"densification \").\nA comparison of the experimental and computed\npower beams showed that experimental values exceed the\ncomputed ones in the dH = 3\u2032 \u00f7 5\u2032 interval for both sets.\n\nBesides, a turn of the experimental PB relative to the\ncomputed PB takes place. These distortions of the PB\nmay be due to a systematic error of the elevation setting\nof the reflective elements of the primary mirror and to\nlarge deviations \"outliers\" of the zero points in a number of reflective panels. These \"outliers\" in the elevation\ncoordinate had the same sign and were due to the wear\nof the moving mechanisms of the reflective panels during\nobservations.\nA comparison of the power beam constructed using observations of the sample consisting of NVSS sources with\nthe experimental power beam obtained from observations\nof 384 in the same sections of the survey shows that the accuracy of the proposed method is at least three times lower\nthan the accuracy of measuring the PB from observations\nof 384. However, although the two methods have different\naccuracy of measurement of the vertical PB, the estimated\nturns of the experimental PB relative to the computed\none agree well with each other. Moreover, the two methods yield virtually coincident average ratios of half-widths\nof the experimental and computed PBs obtained from the\nentire sample of sources (KHP BW = 1.03 \u00b1 0.06) and from\n384 (KHP BW = 1.02\u00b10.10). The latter fact indicates that\nthe error of the determination of the fluxes of the observed\nsources is dominant when constructing the experimental\nPB using the method considered.\nWe studied the stability of the PB during the zenith\nfield survey using a sample of 80 NVSS sources observed\nin the central band of the survey during the 1998, 2000,\n\n\fMajorova et al.: Study of the Power Beam Pattern of RATAN-600\n\n13\n\nFig. 16. Same as Fig. 15, but with subsequent \"densification\" of data points.\n2002, and 2003 sets. The parameters of the experimental\nPBs consructed using this sample of sources proved to remain virtually unchanged throughout the sets considered.\nThus the half-width G0.5 of the Gaussian fitted to the experimental PB and the parameter \u2206max that characterizes\nthe shift of the maximum of the experimental PB relative\nto the central section do not change from one set to another and are equal to the G0.5 and \u2206max values for the\nGaussian fitted to the computed PBs (G0.5 = 4.06\u2032 \u00b1 0.10\nand \u2206max = \u22120.024\u2032 \u00b1 0.005). Moreover, the standard errors of the deviations of the experimental PBs from the\ncomputed ones proved to be very accurately the same for\nall observational sets. The mean standard deviation averaged over all sets is \u03c3 = 0.055 \u00b1 0.020. The differences\nbetween the \u03c3 values for different sets are within the corresponding measurement errors. We can thus conclude that\nthe experimental PB of RATAN-600 was sufficiently stable\nduring the RZF survey and agreed well with the computed\nPB in its central part (\u00b16\u2032 ).\nWe use the data obtained when constructing the experimental PB for the 1998\u20132003 sets to estimate the flux\nmeasurement errors for the sources that were observed at\n7.6 cm during the zenith field survey and were included\ninto the RZF catalog [1]. The standard error of the measured fluxes for the entire sample of sources considered\nvaries in the interval (0.15 \u00f7 0.27) \u00b1 0.05 depending on\nhow bright is the source and how far it is from the central section of the PB. The RZF catalog includes only\nobjects located within \u22122\u2032 < dH < 2\u2032 from the central section of the survey. The estimate of the flux error\n(\u00b115% \u00f7 \u00b125%) obtained by Bursov et al. [1] agrees with\n\nthe results of this study implying flux errors of 0.15 \u00f7 0.24\nin the \u22122\u2032 < dH < 2\u2032 interval.\nThe foregoing leads us to the following conclusion.\nDespite the possibly large scatter of data points on the experimental PBs constructed using the technique proposed\nin this paper, these power beam patterns, if subjected to\nthe procedure of \"densification\", fully reproduce the features of the PB measured using the more accurate radioastronomical method [18]. Our technique can be used not\nonly to measure the power beams in the process of the\nsurvey, but also to draw sufficiently reliable conclusions\nconcerning the state of the antenna of the radio telescope\nand the measurement errors of the survey proper.\nThe data on the two-dimensional power beam pattern of RATAN-600 are already used to interpret the\ntwo-dimensional sky survey in the declination band \u00b11\u25e6 :\n40o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 < Dec2000 < 42o 30\u2032 42\u2032\u2032 , 0h \u2264 R.A. < 24h and\nfor deeper \"cleaning\" of discrete radio sources located far\nfrom the axis of the PB.\nAcknowledgements.
