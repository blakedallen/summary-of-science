The experimentally observed multiplet structure of the Standard Model, as well as other qualitative indications, strongly\nfavor the embedding of the Standard Model in larger unifying groups. This embedding can be realized either at the level of an effective field theory below the Planck\nscale, or directly in a heterotic\u2013string realization, formulated as a model of perturbative quantum gravity at the Planck scale.\nA general consequence of the Standard Model multiplet unification is that the\nunification scale is separated from the electroweak scale by fifteen orders of magnitude. This arises from the fact that the multiplet unification of the Standard model\nspectrum results in proton decay mediating operators. Compatibility of this hypothesis with the measured gauge parameters at the electroweak scale and the observed\nsuppression of the left\u2013handed neutrino masses then provide further strong support\nfor the validity of the grand unification scenario. The unification hypothesis substantially reduces the number of free parameters of the Standard Model and is hence also\nwell motivated from the perspective of reducing some of the arbitrariness found in\nthe Standard Model. String theory then provides a consistent framework for quantum gravity unification, in the context of which all the Standard Model parameters\nshould, in principle, be calculable from a minimal set of fundamental parameters.\nAn important augmentation to the unification program is that of space\u2013time\nsupersymmetry. While not yet substantiated experimentally, supersymmetry is supported by several observations, including the consistency of a large top quark mass\nwith the supersymmetric radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. However, proton\nlongevity is more problematic in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model\n[1], which admit dimension four and five baryon and lepton number violating operators [2]. In the MSSM one imposes a global symmetry, R\u2212parity (Rp ), which forbids\nthe dangerous dimension four operators, while the difficulty with the dimension five\noperators can only be circumvented if one further assumes that the relevant Yukawa\ncouplings are sufficiently suppressed. The proton lifetime problem becomes especially\nacute in the context of heterotic\u2013string unification, in which all operators that are\ncompatible with the local gauge symmetries are expected to arise from nonrenormalizable terms. Indeed this issue has been examined in the past by a number of authors\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The avenues explored range from the existence of matter parity at special points in the moduli space of particular models to the emergence of non\u2013Abelian\ncustodial symmetries in specific compactifications [5].\nThe most realistic heterotic\u2013string models constructed to date are the models\nconstructed in the free fermionic formulation [8]. This has given rise to a large set of\nsemi\u2013realistic models [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 5, 14, 15], which differ in their detailed phenomenological characteristics and share an underlying Z2 \u00d7Z2 orbifold structure [16].\n2\n\n\fPast investigations examined several possibilities to explain the proton longevity. For\nexample, ref. [17] stipulated the possibility that the U(1)Z \u2032 , which is embedded in\nSO(10), remains unbroken down to the TeV scale and suppresses the problematic\ndimension 4 operators. In ref. [5] it was shown that the free fermionic string models\noccasionally give rise to non\u2013Abelian custodial symmetries, which forbid proton decay mediating operators to all orders of non\u2013renormalizable terms. These proposals,\nhowever, fall short of providing a satisfactory solution, as they are, in general, exclusive to the generation of light neutrino masses through a see\u2013saw mechanism. For\nexample, the absence of the SO(10) 126 representation in string models [18] necessitates that the SO(10) U(1)Z \u2032 be broken at a high scale, rather than at a low scale.\nSimilarly, to date, the existence of the custodial non\u2013Abelian symmetries seems to\nbe exclusive to the generation of a see\u2013saw mass matrix.\nRefs. [6, 7] proposed that heterotic\u2013string unification necessitates the existence of\nan additional U(1) symmetry, beyond the Standard Model, which remains unbroken\ndown to low or intermediate energy. Invariance under the extra U(1) forbids the\nproton decay mediating operators, which can be generated only after U(1)Z \u2032 breaking.\nThe magnitude of the proton decay mediating operators is therefore proportional to\nthe U(1)Z \u2032 breaking scale, \u039bZ \u2032 , which is in turn constrained by the proton lifetime\nlimit, and other phenomenological constraints. On the other hand the additional\nU(1) should not forbid quark, lepton and seesaw mass terms. It was argued [6, 7]\nthat the required U(1) symmetry is not of the type that arises in SO(10) or E6\nGUTs. Rather, it should arise from the U(1) symmetries in the string models that\nare external to the GUT symmetries.\nBy studying the spectrum and symmetries of the string model of ref. [12] Pati\nshowed [6] that U(1) symmetries with the required properties do indeed exist in the\nstring models, and arise from combinations of the flavor symmetries. In ref. [7] it was\nshown that the required symmetries can in fact remain unbroken by the choices of\nsupersymmetric flat directions in the string vacuum. In the present paper we continue\nto explore these ideas. The basic approach that we pursue is to develop field theory\nmodels that are inspired from the string models. By this we aim to confront the\nstring features with the experimental data. Our main goal in the present paper is\nto examine whether the string symmetries that are used to guarantee the proton\nlongevity can indeed at the same time allow for adequate suppression of the neutrino\nmasses. That this is a nontrivial requirement can be seen from the fact that if we\ninsisted on gauged B \u2212 L as the proton protector, it would imply a neutrino in the\nMeV range [20].\nWe note that the possibility of utilizing U(1) gauge symmetry to insure proton\nlongevity has also been discussed in the context of purely field theory models [21].\nThe novelty here is the consideration of U(1) symmetries that arise in the context the\nrealistic free fermionic string models. From the string models we extract the charges\nof the Standard Model fields under the various U(1) symmetries. We examine which\ncombinations of the U(1) symmetries forbid the dangerous baryon and lepton number\n\n3\n\n\fviolating operators while still allowing for the see\u2013saw mass terms. We then assume\nthat all but two of the additional U(1)s are broken in the string vacuum by the\nchoices of supersymmetric flat directions. The first one being the U(1)Z \u2032 which is\nembedded in SO(10), and the second being the additional unbroken U(1) that arises\nfrom the flavor symmetries of the string model. We proceed to construct the see\u2013\nsaw mass matrix by postulating additional Higgs spectrum and comment how it may\narise from the string models. We then demonstrate that such additional stringy U(1)\nsymmetries can indeed guarantee proton longevity and viable phenomenology in the\nneutrino sector, as well as in the quark and charged lepton sectors.\n\n2\n\nGauge symmetries in free fermionic models\n\nIn this section we discuss the general structure of the realistic free fermionic\nmodels, and of the additional U(1) symmetries that arise in these models. The\nfree fermionic heterotic\u2013string formulation yields a large number of three generation\nmodels, which possess an underlying Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orbifold structure [16], and differ in\ntheir detailed phenomenological characteristics. We emphasize the features of the\nmodels that are common to this large class of realistic models.\nThe free fermionic models are constructed by specifying a set of boundary conditions basis vectors and the one\u2013loop GSO projection coefficients [8]. The physical\nmassless states are obtained by acting on the vacuum with bosonic and fermionic operators and by applying the generalized GSO projections. The U(1) charges, Q(f ),\nwith respect to the unbroken Cartan generators of the four dimensional gauge group,\nwhich are in one to one correspondence with the U(1) currents f \u2217 f for each complex\nfermion f , are given by:\n1\nQ(f ) = \u03b1(f ) + F (f ),\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03b1(f ) is the boundary condition of the world\u2013sheet fermion f in the sector \u03b1,\nand F\u03b1 (f ) is a fermion number operator.\nThe four dimensional gauge group in the three generation free fermionic models\narises as follows. The models can in general be regarded as constructed in two\nstages. The first stage consists of the NAHE set, {1, S, b1 , b2 , b3 } [13]. The gauge\ngroup after imposing the GSO projections induced by the NAHE set basis vectors is\nSO(10)\u00d7SO(6)3 \u00d7E8 with N = 1 supersymmetry. The space\u2013time vector bosons that\ngenerate the gauge group arise from the Neveu\u2013Schwarz sector and from the sector\n1 + b1 + b2 + b3 . The Neveu\u2013Schwarz sector produces the generators of SO(10) \u00d7\nSO(6)3 \u00d7 SO(16). The sector \u03b6 \u2261 1 + b1 + b2 + b3 produces the spinorial 128 of\nSO(16) and completes the hidden gauge group to E8 . At the level of the NAHE set\nthe sectors b1 , b2 and b3 produce 48 multiplets, 16 from each, in the 16 representation\nof SO(10). The states from the sectors bj are singlets of the hidden E8 gauge group\nand transform under the horizontal SO(6)j (j = 1, 2, 3) symmetries. This structure\n4\n\n\fis common to all the realistic free fermionic models. At this stage we anticipate that\nthe SO(10) group gives rise to the Standard Model group factors, whereas the SO(6)3\ngroups may produce additional symmetries that can play a role in safeguarding the\nproton lifetime.\nThe second stage of the free fermionic basis construction consists of adding to the\nNAHE set three (or four) additional boundary condition basis vectors. These additional basis vectors reduce the number of generations to three chiral generations, one\nfrom each of the sectors b1 , b2 and b3 , and simultaneously break the four dimensional\ngauge group. The SO(10) symmetry is broken to one of its subgroups SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)\n[9], SO(6) \u00d7 SO(4) [11], SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)2 \u00d7 U(1) [15] or SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)2\n[10, 12, 14]. Similarly, the hidden E8 symmetry is broken to one of its subgroups by\nthe basis vectors which extend the NAHE set. This hidden E8 subgroup may, or may\nnot, contain U(1) factors which are not enhanced to a non\u2013Abelian symmetry. As\nthe Standard Model states are not charged with respect to these U(1) symmetries,\nthey cannot play a role in suppressing the proton decay mediating operators, and\nare therefore not discussed further here. On the other hand, the flavor SO(6)3 symmetries in the NAHE\u2013based models are always broken to flavor U(1) symmetries, as\nthe breaking of these symmetries is correlated with the number of chiral generations.\nThree such U(1)j symmetries are always obtained in the NAHE based free fermionic\nmodels, from the subgroup of the observable E8 , which is orthogonal to SO(10).\nThese are produced by the world\u2013sheet currents \u03b7\u0304 \u03b7\u0304 \u2217 (j = 1, 2, 3), which are part of\nthe Cartan sub\u2013algebra of the observable E8 . Additional unbroken U(1) symmetries,\ndenoted typically by U(1)j (j = 4, 5, ...), arise by pairing two real fermions from the\nsets {\u0233 3,***,6 }, {\u0233 1,2, \u03c9\u0304 5,6 } and {\u03c9\u0304 1,***,4 }. The final observable gauge group depends on\nthe number of such pairings.\nSubsequent to constructing the basis vectors and extracting the massless spectrum\nthe analysis of the free fermionic models proceeds by calculating the superpotential.\nThe cubic and higher-order terms in the superpotential are obtained by evaluating\nthe correlators\n(2.2)\nAN \u223c hV1f V2f V3b * * * VNb i,\n\nwhere Vif (Vib ) are the fermionic (scalar) components of the vertex operators, using\nthe rules given in [19]. Typically, one of the U(1) factors in the free-fermion models\nis anomalous, and generates a Fayet\u2013Ilioupolos term which breaks supersymmetry\nat the Planck scale. The anomalous U(1) is broken, and supersymmetry is restored,\nby a non\u2013trivial VEV for some scalar field that is charged under the anomalous\nU(1). Since this field is in general also charged with respect to the other anomalyfree U(1) factors, some non-trivial set of other fields must also get non\u2013vanishing\nVEVs V to ensure a supersymmetric vacuum. Some of these fields will appear in\nthe nonrenormalizable terms (2.2), leading to effective operators of lower dimension.\nTheir coefficients contain factors of order V/M \u223c 1/10. Typically the solution of the\nD\u2013 and F\u2013flatness constraints break most or all of the horizontal U(1) symmetries.\nThe question is whether there exist string symmetries, which are beyond the GUT\n5\n\n\fsymmetries and can provide an appealing explanation for the proton lifetime. In a\nbeautifully insightful paper [6] Pati studied this question in the model of ref [12], and\nshowed that such symmetries indeed exist in the string models. In ref. [7] it was\nshown that the required symmetries can in fact remain unbroken below the string\nscale, and hence provide the needed suppression. However, as emphasized above, an\nimportant question is whether the additional symmetry that suppresses the baryon\nand lepton number violating operators, still allows at the same time the generation\nof a neutrino seesaw mass matrix and hence an acceptable neutrino mass spectrum.\nIn this paper we address this question.\n\nProton decay and superstring Z \u2032\n\n3\n\nFor concreteness we focus on the string model of ref. [12], giving rise to the\nobservable gauge symmetry\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)C \u00d7 U(1)L \u00d7 U(1)1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 U(1)6 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nU(1)C and U(1)L will, apart from the SM's hypercharge, produce one of the additional\ngauge bosons which appears in the string models, and constrain the proton decay\nmediating operators. The charges of the Standard Model states under U(1)L and\nU(1)C are fixed in the string model, as are the charges of U(1)1,...,6. We further\nassume that the low energy spectrum contains two light Higgs representations, which\nare the h\u03041 and h45 of [12], with\nH U = h1 = [(1, 0); (2, 1)]0,\u22121,0,0,0,0 ,\nH D = h45 = [(1, 0); (2, \u22121)]\u2212 1 ,\u2212 1 ,0,0,0,0.\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n2\n\nPrior to rotating the anomaly into a single U(1)6\u2032 , all of the U(1)1,***,6 are anomalous:\nTrU1 = TrU2 = TrU3 = 24, TrU4 = TrU5 = TrU6 = \u221212.

The gauge group is SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7\n7\n\n\fU(1)Y . a, b are SU(2)\u2013indices (taking on the values 1, 2), x, y, z are SU(3)\u2013indices\n(taking on the values 1, 2, 3), i, j, k are generational indices, taking on the values\n1, 2, 3; the heaviest generation is labeled by 1, which is not the same convention as\ne.g. in some papers on R\n6 p ; concerning \u039b\u2032ijk , note that we work with the operator QLD\nrather than LQD. Summation over repeated indices is implied; \u03b4 ... is the Kronecker\nsymbol, \u03b5... symbolizes any tensor that is totally antisymmetric with respect to the\nexchange of two indices, with \u03b512... = 1. All other symbols are coupling constants. The\nright blocks of (3.7) contain right\u2013handed neutrinos, the left ones do not; the upper\nblocks contain Rp \u2013conserving terms, the lower ones do not. Thus the superpotential\nof the MSSM is given by the upper left block.\nThe unbroken new symmetries U(1)1\u2032 ,***,6\u2032 strongly reduce the number of renormalizable operators in the low-energy superpotential of the MSSM+N +6Rp : Imposing\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)...\u2032 on (3.7) gives that\n(U )\n\n(N )\n\n(D)\n\n(D)\n\n(U )\n\n(N )\n\n(D)\n\n(E)\n\n(U )\n\n(N )\n\n(D)\n\n(E)\n\n(E)\n\n(E)\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)1\u2032\n\nallows G22 , G22 , G12 , G21 , G33 , G12 , G21 , G33 ,\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)3\u2032\n\nallows Gii , Gii\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)4\u2032\n\nallows\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)5\u2032\n\nallows\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)2\u2032\n\nallows Gij , Gij , Gij , Gij for i, j = 1, 2,\n\nU(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)6\u2032\n\nallows\n\nfor i = 1, 2, 3;\n\n(D)\n(D)\n(D)\n(E)\n(E)\n(E)\nG12 , G21 , G33 , G12 , G21 , G33 , \u03bc,\n(N )\n(U )\nGii , Gii for i, j = 1, 2, 3;\n(U )\n(U )\n(N )\n(N )\nG21 , G12 , G21 , G12 ; \u03bc.\n(U )\n(N )\nGij , Gij for i, j = 1, 2, 3,\n(U )\n(N )\nGij , Gij for i, j = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(3.8)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nIf U(1)Z \u2032 and all U(1)...\u2032 were exact, only the two terms Q2 H U U and L2 H U N\nin (3.7) would be allowed. Thus we assume that all but one, labeled U(1)?\u2032 , get\nbroken near the heterotic\u2013string scale MS \u223c 1018 GeV. Hence the gauge group at\nhigh energies below the Planck\u2013scale is given by\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)?\u2032 .\ni\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe assume that the N do not get a VEV. Thus to break the U(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)?\u2032 gauge\nsymmetries we add the left\u2013handed SM\u2013singlet fields A, B and R, S, T to the fields of\nthe MSSM+N. The underlying SO(10) structure of the model demands A, B to be\na vector\u2013like couple with respect to U(1)Z \u2032 , with A having the charge of the right\u2013\nhanded neutrino N . We take A, B to be uncharged with respect to U(1)?\u2032 , as we\nrequire that the VEVs of A, B do not break U(1)?\u2032 because we assume the breaking\nscale of U(1)Z \u2032 to be much higher than the breaking scale of U(1)?\u2032 . The phenomenological constraints that we discuss below imply that \u039b?\u2032 has to be considerably above\nthe electroweak scale. The stringy background of the model requires R, S, T to be\nuncharged under U(1)Z \u2032 . Fixing their U(1)?\u2032 \u2013charges basically is the only freedom\n8\n\n\fin our string\u2013inspired model. The choices we make here aim at generating a simple\nsee\u2013saw matrix. In the string models the additional Higgs spectrum may arise from\nfundamental states in the massless string spectrum, or from product of fields that\nproduce these effective quantum numbers [22].\nFrom (3.8) we see that U(1)4\u2032 , U(1)5\u2032 , U(1)6\u2032 are too restrictive, and U(1)1\u2032\nstill allows too few entries in G(U ) , G(N ) to be U(1)?\u2032 . U(1)2\u2032 and U(1)3\u2032 look more\npromising, and we study both cases. U(1)2\u2032 leads to a model with no mass\u2013scale, as\nit forbids the \u03bc\u2013term. If U(1)2\u2032 suppresses, or forbids, the proton decay mediating\noperators, while still allowing the see\u2013saw mass terms, and setting\nthe order of the \u03bc\u2013parameter by its breaking scale, then U(1)2\u2032 yields an example\nof a U(1) symmetry that, provided that it remains unbroken down to a sufficiently\nlow scale, can address the proton lifetime and neutrino mass issues, as well as provide\na solution to the \u03bc\u2013problem. However, U(1)2\u2032 also forbids the mass terms for one\ngeneration, which are therefore suppressed by \u039b2\u2032 /MS . One could contemplate the\npossibility that this deficit is cured by radiative corrections. U(1)3\u2032 allows both masses\nfor all generations and also a \u03bc\u2013term. In this case therefore we have to ascertain\nthat the additional Higgs VEVs do not generate a large \u03bc\u2013term. However, unlike\nU(1)2\u2032 , U(1)3\u2032 does not forbid the proton\u2013destabilizing dimension five operators, and\nin particular, the operators Q3 Q3 Q3 L3 and U 3 U 3 D 3 E 3 . Therefore in the case of\nU(1)3\u2032 additional suppression of the dimension five operators is required. In the\ncontext of the string models such suppression is anticipated due to the additional\nU(1) symmetries that are broken by the choices of supersymmetric flat directions at\nthe string scale.\n3.1\n\nThe case of U(1)3\u2032\nWe first focus on the case of U(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)3\u2032 .

In order to avoid D\u2013term SUSY\u2013breaking contributions that are larger than 1 TeV we impose hRi2 \u2212 hSi2 \u2264 1 (TeV)2 and\nhAi2 \u2212 hBi2 \u2264 1 (TeV)2 .

On the other hand the proton longevity severely constrains the possible extensions of the Standard Model and serves as a useful guide in\nattempts to understand the origin of the Standard Model gauge and matter spectrum.\nThe realistic free fermionic heterotic\u2013string models reproduce the grand unification\nstructures that are suggested by the Standard Model and represent the most realistic\nstring models constructed to date. As such the realistic free fermionic models serve as\na useful probe to the fundamental characteristics of the possibly true string vacuum,\nas well as to various properties that the string vacuum should possess in order to\nsatisfy various phenomenological constraints. It was proposed previously that proton\nstability necessitates the existence of an additional U(1) symmetry, which remains\nunbroken down to intermediate or low energies. Furthermore, the required symmetry\nis not of the type that arises in Grand Unified Theories, but is of intrinsic string\norigin. The realistic free fermionic models do indeed give rise to U(1) symmetries,\nwhich are external to the GUT symmetries, and forbid the proton decay mediating\noperators.\n\u2020\u2020\n\nHowever, MA should be sufficiently large so that the two particles with mass \u223c MA would not\nhave been detected\n\u2021\u2021\nWe note again that in our convention '1' labels the heaviest generation; we also work with QLD\ninstead of LQD.\n\n17\n\n\fOne of the vital issues in heterotic\u2013string Grand Unification is whether it is possible to adequately suppress the proton decay mediating operators, and at the same\ntime insure that the left\u2013handed neutrino masses are sufficiently small. That this is\na non\u2013trivial task is seen, for example, from the fact that a VEV of the neutral component in the 16 and 16 of SO(10), which is used in the string models to generate the\nrequired large see\u2013saw mass scale, at the same time can induce the dangerous proton\ndecay mediating operators from non\u2013renormalizable terms. The solution pursued\nhere therefore advocates the existence of an additional U(1) symmetry, which forbids\nthe proton decay mediating operators, while it permits the neutrino seesaw\u2013matrix\nmass terms, as well as those of the quarks and charged\u2013leptons. Thus, provided that\nthe additional U(1) is broken at a sufficiently low scale, the proton decay mediating\noperators will be adequately suppressed. In this paper we demonstrated that indeed\nthe symmetries that appear in the string models can guarantee proton longevity and\nsimultaneously suppress the left\u2013handed neutrino masses. We achieved this by assuming additional Higgs spectrum that is needed to break the U(1)Z \u2032 \u00d7 U(1)?\u2032 and\nby detailed construction of the neutrino see\u2013saw mass matrix. Such additional Higgs\nspectrum arises in the string models from fundamental states or from product of\nstates that produce the effective quantum number of the states that we assumed\nhere. We then analyzed the neutrino see\u2013saw mass matrix and showed that the resulting neutrino mass spectrum is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally\nobserved values.\nIt is interesting to note that among the semi\u2013realistic orbifold models constructed\nto date the free fermionic models are unique in the sense that they are the only ones\nthat have been shown to admit the SO(10) embedding of the Standard Model spectrum. This is true of the Z3 heterotic string models [28] as well as the type I string\nmodels, which do not admit the chiral 16 of SO(10) in the perturbative massless spectrum. This in particular means that these models do not admit the canonical SO(10)\nembedding of the weak\u2013hypercharge. In these models the weak\u2013hypercharge arises\nfrom a non\u2013minimal combination of the world\u2013sheet U(1) currents, which correctly\nreproduces the Standard Model hypercharge assignments. Therefore, the models do\ncontain a number of U(1) symmetries that may suppress the proton decay mediating operators, and the suppression depends on the U(1)Z \u2032 symmetry breaking scale.\nHowever, the non\u2013canonical embedding of the weak hypercharge typically results in\nexotic states which cannot be decoupled from the massless spectrum. As regard the\nissue of neutrino masses, the non\u2013standard embedding of the weak\u2013hypercharge implies that this issue can only be studied on a case by case basis, and general patterns\nare more difficult to decipher. The case of type I constructions presents additional\nnovelties. In this case the Standard Model gauge group typically arises from a product of U(n) groups. Therefore, embedding of the Standard Model gauge group in an\nenlarged gauge structure is not obtained in type I string models. Consequently, one\nthen often finds a gauged U(1)B in these models, which guarantees proton longevity.\nThe suppression of neutrino masses in this context still remains an open issue that\n\n18\n\n\fcan only be addressed on a case by case basis. However, due to the non\u2013standard\nembedding of the weak\u2013hypercharge, these models have typically been considered\nin the context of low scale gravity models [29]. In which case the suppression of of\nleft\u2013handed neutrino masses may arise from the large volume of the extra dimensions\n[30].\nTo conclude, the Standard Model multiplet structure, augmented with the right\u2013\nhanded neutrinos, strongly indicates the realization of an underlying SO(10) structure\nin nature. Preservations of the SO(10) embedding in the context of string unification\nhas proven to be a highly non\u2013trivial task. In fact, among the semi\u2013realistic orbifold\nmodels, only the free fermionic models are known to reproduce this desired structure. However, the problems of proton longevity and the simultaneous suppression\nof the left\u2013handed neutrino masses, still pose an extremely severe challenge to Grand\nUnified, and heterotic\u2013string, models. It has been proposed that these challenges necessitate the existence of an extra non\u2013GUT U(1) symmetry, broken at low energies,\nand that the required symmetries do arise in the free fermionic heterotic\u2013string models. In this paper by constructing detailed string inspired models, we showed that the\nadditional stringy U(1) symmetries can indeed perform their designated task. The\nrelative simplicity of the additional Higgs spectrum that we assumed here, suggests\nthat further more detailed models might be able to fully reproduce the observed\nquark and lepton mass spectrum, as well as safeguarding the proton lifetime.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Sacha Davidson and Athanasios Dedes for useful discussions and the CERN theory group for hospitality.
