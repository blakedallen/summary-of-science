Motivation\nThe PIENU experiment at TRIUMF [1] is aiming at a measurement of the branching ratio R =\n\u0393(\u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd + \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd + \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b3) with\nprecision <0.1%. The principal instrument used\nto measure positron energies from \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd decays (Ee+ = 70 MeV) and \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd followed by\n\u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03bd decays (Ee+ = 0 \u2212 53 MeV) is a large\nsingle crystal NaI(Tl) detector [2]. Detailed knowledge of the crystal response is essential to reaching high precision, especially for determining the\nlow energy tail response below 60 MeV [3]. In the\nfollowing, results of measurements of the response\nof the NaI(Tl) crystal to mono-energetic positron\nbeams are presented along with Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations including photonuclear reactions.\n2. Experiment Setup\nThe 48 cm diameter, 48 cm long NaI(Tl) crystal [2] under study was surrounded by two adjacent\nrings of 97 pure CsI crystals [4]. Each ring was\ncomprised of two layers of 8.5 cm thick, 25 cm long\n\ncrystals. Positrons from the M13 beamline at TRIUMF [5] were injected into the NaI(Tl) crystal to\nstudy its response. The positrons were produced\nby 500 MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron\nstriking a 1 cm thick beryllium target. After defining the beam momentum at the first focus, the M13\nbeam line is equipped with two more dipole magnets and two foci with slits before the final focus at\nthe detector. The vacuum window was a 0.13 mm\nthick, 15 cm diameter Mylar foil. With this geometry, slit scattering and the effect of the vacuum window were expected to have negligible effect on the\nlow energy tail. The incoming beam was measured\nwith a telescope (see fig. 1) consisting of 6 planes\nof wire chambers arranged in the orientation of XU-V-X-U-V, where U(V) was at 60\u25e6 (\u221260\u25e6 ) to the\nvertical direction, a plastic scintillator (5\u00d75 cm2\narea, 3.2 mm thickness), and the NaI(Tl) calorimeter. The beam momentum width and horizontal\n(vertical) size and divergence were 1.5% in FWHM,\n2cm (1cm) and \u00b150mrad (\u00b190mrad), respectively.\nThe beam composition was 63% \u03c0 + , 11% \u03bc+ and\n26% e+ .\n3.

The beam\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n\fsuppressed slit scattering, no effect on the positron\nenergy spectrum was found including the relative\nintensity of the peaks. Also, different tunes of the\nbeamline (e.g. different focusing) did not change\nthe measured energy spectrum. The beam momentum was varied in order to observe the corresponding position of the peaks. Fig. 2 also shows the\nspectra for 60 and 80 MeV/c beam momenta shifted\nand plotted on top of the reference histogram at the\nnominal momentum of 70 MeV/c. Signals from the\nCsI crystals were used to suppress the low energy\ntail due to shower leakage to enhance the second\nand third peaks. For all three beam momenta, the\nrelative positions of the low energy peaks remained\nunchanged. The beam position dependence of the\nNaI(Tl) spectrum was also tested using wire chamber information, without finding any effect. Based\non these tests, it is unlikely that there is an influence of the beam settings in the appearance of the\nadditional structures in the energy spectrum.\nIn fig. 3 (top), the deposited energy in the\nNaI(Tl) crystal is shown as a function of the CsI hit\ntime. The horizontal band at the beam energy corresponds to accidental events, while the coincident\nones from shower leakage are concentrated around\n0 ns. There are delayed events in the low energy region that correspond to the second and third peaks.\nIf delayed events between the vertical lines are selected, the shaded spectrum in fig. 3 (bottom) is obtained. The first peak (at approximately 70 MeV)\nis consistent with accidental coincidences. The second and the third peaks were enhanced after the\ndelayed coincidence requirement. These results are\nconsistent with the hypothesis of neutrons escaping the NaI(Tl) and giving a delayed signal in the\nCsI. Moreover, the energy deficits of the second and\nthird peaks are consistent with the separation energies for one (En = 9.14 MeV) and two neutrons\n(E2n = 16.3 MeV) emitted from 127 I. Since only the\nfirst hit is plotted in fig. 3, the observed secondary\npeaks are not due to the slow component of the CsI\npulse.\nThe yield of the second peak is consistent with\nthe 30% solid angle and estimated 10% detection\nefficiency of the CsI calorimeter for neutron capture. A delay of 100 ns is also consistent with the\nTOF of < 1 MeV neutrons.\nTo estimate the number of neutrons involved in\nthe second and third peaks, two Gaussian functions on a background with an exponential shape\nwere fitted to both histograms in fig. 3 (bottom).\nThe ratio N2 (N3 ) of the number of events in\n\nCsI Crystals\nScintillator\nMylar Foil\nBeam pipe\n\nPositron Beam\nWire Chambers\n\nNaI(Tl)\n\nFigure 1: Schematic description of the experimental setup\n(not to scale). The beam comes from the right and impinges\non the NaI(Tl) crystal surrounded by two rings of 97 CsI\ncrystals. In front of the NaI(Tl), there are 6 planes of wire\nchambers and a plastic scintillator.\n\ntiming with respect to the 23 MHz cyclotron radio frequency provided particle identification based\non time-of-flight (TOF) together with the energy\nloss in the beam scintillator, allowing selection of\npositrons for studying the crystal response function. Events due to positrons from decays of muons\npreviously stopped in the NaI(Tl) crystal were suppressed by requiring wire chamber hits, and using\nTOF and pileup cuts. Pion and muon contamination was reduced in the data to the 0.08% level.\nThe CsI crystals were used in veto mode to select events without shower leakage from the NaI(Tl)\nas well as for tagging events with delayed particle\nemission. Leakage from the NaI(Tl)'s downstream\nface was not detected but minimized by the 19 radiation length thickness of the crystal.\nThe resulting positron energy spectrum is shown\nin fig. 2 (dark shaded histogram). The main peak at\n70 MeV has an asymmetrical shape due primarily to\nshower leakage with a width of 2.7% (FWHM). Subtracting the calculated beam momentum width in\nquadrature gave a NaI(Tl) crystal resolution of approximately 2.2% (FWHM). Besides the main peak\nat 70 MeV, there are two additional structures at\n62 and 54 MeV.\nStudies were made to determine whether the additional peaks had either instrumental or physical\norigin.

Histograms are scaled differently for easier comparison.\n\n10\n1\n0\n\nthe second (third) peak before and after the delayed coincidence requirement is proportional to the\nproduct of the neutron detection efficiency and the\nnumber of neutrons involved, n2 (n3 ). The quantity N = N3 /N2 = n3 /n2 indicates the ratio of\nthe neutron multiplicities, which was found to be\nN = 2.1 \u00b1 0.2. Assuming that one neutron is involved in the second peak, this result suggests that\nthe third peak arises when two neutrons escape\nfrom the crystal.\nThe previous branching ratio experiment [3] was\nnot able to detect these peaks because of the poorer\nenergy resolution of the NaI(Tl) crystal (3 \u2212 4%\nFWHM) employed.\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nDeposited Energy in NaI(Tl) (MeV)\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFigure 3: (Top) Deposited energy versus CsI hit timing.\n(Bottom) The shaded histogram represents events selected\nby the timing cut (between the lines) shown on the top figure.\n\nthat photonuclear reactions followed by neutron escape from the crystal are indeed responsible for the\nadditional peak structures. Positrons entering the\ncrystal produce an electromagnetic shower. One\nor more photons of the shower can be captured by\n127\nI nuclei. In the MC simulation, nuclear photoabsorption is generally followed by emission of\nneutrons (94%), protons (4%) or \u03b1-particles (2%).\nThe kinetic energy and the separation energy of the\nneutron are not observed by the NaI(Tl) crystal if\nthe neutron escapes. The second peak in the deposited energy spectrum starts at E1n below the\nbeam energy, where this reaction channel opens.\nAccording to the MC, the origin of the third peak\nin the spectrum is due to emission and escape of\ntwo neutrons. The neutrons can come from a single nucleus or from two separate ones (due to more\nphoto-absorptions in the same shower). Both cases\ncontribute to the third peak which starts at an energy consistent with either the energy threshold of\ntwo neutron emission or twice the single separation\nenergy E1n .\nThe distribution of the kinetic energy for escaping neutrons is shown in fig. 5. The dashed his-\n\n4. Simulation\nA MC simulation was developed, including all\nphysics effects available in the GEANT4 package\n[6, 7]. In particular, photonuclear reactions with\nneutron(s) emission, scattering and absorption were\ntaken into account using the QGSP BERT physics\nprocesses list. In fig. 4, the spectra obtained with\nthe same detector setting with a monochromatic\nbeam is shown. If in the simulation only electromagnetic interactions were considered (dark shaded\nhistogram), the low energy tail shows no structure.\nIf hadronic interactions were included, additional\nstructures appear (light shaded histogram), which\nare similar to those observed in the data (filled circles). A closer look at the simulated data shows\n3\n\n\f103\n\n10\u22121\n\n102\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22123\n\n10\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22125\n40\n\n1\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nDeposited Energy (MeV)\n\nNeutron Kinetic Energy (MeV)\n\nFigure 4: Comparison between data (filled circles with error\nbars) and simulation.

The difference between the two\nspectra is due to elastic and inelastic scattering reactions in the NaI(Tl) crystal.\nIn fig. 6, the correlation between the number\nof elastic scatterings and the neutron kinetic energy at production is shown. Figs. 5 and 6 suggest\nthat, although the primary source of the second and\nthird peaks is low energy neutron emission from\nphotonuclear reactions, many neutron elastic scatterings significantly lower the escaping neutron kinetic energy, returning \"lost\" energy to the NaI(Tl)\ncrystal.\nThe agreement between simulation and experiment is not perfect. Given the high number of interactions which a neutron can experience in a large\ncrystal, a small error in the models for elastic and\ninelastic scattering can be amplified.
