The solution is an extension of the well-known interior solution with a parabolic distribution of mass\ndensity and describes more compact astrophysical objects such as neutron and hyperon stars. It is shown that a\nbehaviour of the new mass density distribution near the stellar centre can be described as a cusp catastrophe.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe problem of finding exact solutions of Einstein's\nequations is connected, above all, with their nonlinearity. Therefore every new exact solution always calls\ncertain interest, both from the point of view of a physical interpretation and from the point of view of the\nmethod of its derivation.\nSchwarzschild's known interior solution (see [1]) is an\nexact interior solution of the Einstein's equations with\na homogeneous distribution of a Pascal neutral perfect\nfluid. This solution describes the interior field of a static\nstar. The main shortcoming of this solution is that the\nvelocity of sound exceeds the velocity of light. The mass\ndensity is constant in the whole volume of the astrophysical object and has a finite jump on the stellar surface.\nAnother exact interior solution [2],[3] is free of the\nabove shortcoming. The solution describes a fluid ball\nwith the parabolic law of mass density decrease from\nthe centre to the surface. However, both solutions near\nthe stellar centre behave almost equally with rrespect\nto Petrov's algebraic type. The Schwarzschild interior\nsolution has the algebraic type 0. The second solution,\nin a small neighbourhood of the ball centre, has approximately the same algebraic type 0.\nIn the present article, the problem of generalization\nof the solution with a parabolic distribution of the mass\ndensity for a neutral Pascal fluid is considered.\n\n2.\n\nMetric and gravitational equations\n\nThe Einstein equations with the static metric\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nds = G (x)d\u03c4 + 2L(x)d\u03c4 dx \u2212 x (d\u03b8 + sin\u03b8 d\u03c6 ) (1)\nand the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect Pascal\nfluid\nT\u03b1 \u03b2 = (\u03bc + p) u\u03b1 u\u03b2 \u2212 p g\u03b1 \u03b2\n(2)\n1 e-mail:\n\nalex m bar@mail.ru\n\nare considered. Thr function \u03bc is the mass density and\np is the pressure; u\u03b1 = dx\u03b1 /ds is the fluid 4D velocity;\n\u03b1 , \u03b2 = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nThese equations can be reduced to the nonlinear\nequation of spatial oscillations\nG\u2032\u2032\u03b6\u03b6 + \u03a92 (\u03b6(x))G = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is the new variable\n\u221a\nd\u03b6 = dy/ \u03b5,\n2\n\n(4)\n\n2\n\nwith \u03b5 = G /L ; \u03c4 = t/R and x = r/R are dimensionless variables; 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1; t, r are the time and\nradial coordinates, y = x2 , 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1, and R is the\nstellar radius. The vacuum velocity of light is chosen to\nbe equal to unity.\nWe can write \u03a92 in a more convenient form:\n\u03a92 = \u2212d(\u03a6/y)dy\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u03c7\n\u03a6=1\u2212\u03b5= \u221a\n2 y\n\nZ\n\n\u03c7\n\u221a\n\u03bc(y) ydy =\nx\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc(x)x2 dx (6)\n\nplays the role of the Newton gravitational potential inside the ball; \u03c7 = \u03ba R2 .\nWhen \u03a92 equals zero, we have the Schwarzschild\ninterior solution. For \u03a92 \u2261 \u03a920 = const, Eq.(3) is\nG\u2032\u2032\u03b6\u03b6 + \u03a920 G = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nand we have the known exact static solution [2], [3]\n\u221a\nG = g00 = G0 cos(\u03a90 \u03b6(x) + \u03b1)\n(8)\nwith \u03a90 = \u03c7 \u03bc0 a/5 and the parabolic distribution of the\nmass density\n\u03bc = \u03bc0 (1 \u2212 a x2 ) = \u03bc0 (1 \u2212 a y),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere a = (\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bcR )/\u03bc0 \u2264 1; \u03bc0 = \u03bc(x = 0); \u03bcR =\n\u03bc(x = 1).\nThis solution describes compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars.\n\n\f314\n\n3.\n\nA.M.Baranov\n\nDarboux's method and an extension of the solution\n\nAccording to Darboux's method [4], an extension of this\nsolution is connected with the choice\n\u03a92 (\u03b6) = \u03a920 + w(\u03b6),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u1ef8 is a particular solution of the equation of a\nlinear spatial oscillator (7) with \u03a9\u030320 = b2 = const. Here\nwe select the function \u1ef8 = cos(b \u03b6).\nSo we have the extension of Eq.(7)\nG\u2032\u2032\u03b6\u03b6 + [\u03a920 \u2212 2b2 sec(b \u03b6)] G = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nThe new function \u03a6\u0303(y) is written as a quadrature:\nZ\n\u03a6\u0303(y) = (\u03c7 \u03bc0 /3)y \u2212 \u03a920 y 2 + b2 y sec2 (b \u03c7(y))dy. (14)\nWith the aid of this function we easily find the new mass\ndensity distribution\nZ\n\u03c7\u03bc\u0303(y) = \u03c7\u03bc0 \u2212 5\u03a920 y + 6b2 sec2 (b \u03b6(y))dy+\n4b2 ysec2 (b \u03b6(y)),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303(0) = \u03bc0 .\nNow the new variable \u03b6 is the quadrature\nZ\n1\ndy\nq\n\u03b6(y) =\n=\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03a6\u0303(y)\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u22122b y\n\nsec\n\n\u0010b Z\n2\n\n#\u22121/2\ndy \u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 ...\n\nSummary\n\nApplication of Darboux's method to a known exact\nstatic interior solution of the gravitational equations\nwith a parabolic mass density distribution makes it\npossible to obtain a new interior solution with a new\nmass density distribution law. The extension of solution\ncan be used for simulation of more compact astrophysical objects: neutron stars and, probably, hyperon stars.\nAnother feature of the new solution is that near the stellar centre the mass density behaviour is described by a\ncusp catastrophe, and, for some values of the parameters included in the expression for the mass density, the\nstability of the star breaks down.\n\nReferences\n\n[4] G.Darboux \"Lecons sur la Theorie Generale des Surfaces. \u2013 Deuxieme Partie \u2013 Livre IV\", Gauthier-Villars\net C \u00ee e, Editeurs, Paris, 1915.\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b70 = 2m/R is the compactness for the model\nwith a parabolic distribution of mass density; m is the\nintegral mass of ball.\nThe expression for the new mass density near the\nstellar centre can be rewritten as\n\u03bc\u0303\n125\u03c302 \u2212 784b2 2 3b2 6\n=1\u2212\nx +\nx =\n\u03bc0\n\u03c30\n2\u03c30\n\n4.\n\n[3] A.M.Baranov, Vestnik of Krasnoyarsk State University.Phys.
