If the state is\nnoisy then in some cases it is possible to run an entanglement distillation process [3] which may be interpreted as\nquantum privacy amplification [4]. Since the final output\nis maximally entangled, it may be used directly for secret\nkey generation. The efficiency of this procedure is quantified with distillable entanglement ED , which defines how\nmany singlet states can be obtained in the asymptotic\nregime per one input.\nStill it was known that certain states which cannot be\nprepared by local operations and classical communication\n(LOCC) are not distillable, exhibiting the phenomenon\nof bound entanglement [5]. For a long time bound entanglement was believed to be useless for cryptography,\nbut several years ago it was shown [6, 7], that at least\nsome bound entangled states may be useful in quantum\ncryptography. This is one extreme instance of the general fact that the amount of distillable secure key KD\nmay exceed the amount of distillable singlets ED . The\nlatter effect has been verified in a recent experiment [8].\nThe key ingredient in the complete theory of distilling\na secret key from quantum states [6, 7] is the notion of\na private bit, p-bit - or more generally a private dit, pdit - which is a delocalized maximally entangled state\nthat still retains some entanglement monogamy result. A\nquantum p-dit is composed from a d\u2297d key part AB, and\nthe shield part A\u2032 B \u2032 , shared between Alice (subsystems\n\nAA\u2032 ) and Bob (subsystems BB \u2032 ) in such a way that the\nlocal von Neumann measurements on the key part in a\nparticular basis will make its results completely statistically uncorrelated from the results of any measurement\nof an eavesdropper Eve on her subsystem E, which is\na part of the purification |\u03a8iABA\u2032 B \u2032 E of the p-dit state\n\u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 . There is a nice explanation how the shield part\nprotects the statistics of the measurement on A and B to\nbe correlated to Eve: it just makes it impossible to distinguish the results of the measurement by an external\nobserver.\nAn obvious way to determine privacy properties is\nto reconstruct tomographically the complete p-dit state\n\u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 . This however is a very time consuming process, especially if the system under investigation is highdimensional. The aim of the present paper is to give\nbounds on the distillable secure key based just on few\nobservables. This advances further the study presented\nin Ref. [9], where it was proposed to carry out a tomography of the so-called privacy-squeezed state of the state\nof merit. We demonstrate that a single observable suffices to provide a nontrivial bound. We also provide more\naccurate estimates based on two observables. These results provide tools for application-specific detection of\nentanglement, refining the fundamental concept of the\nentanglement witness proposed in [10] and [11] that can\nbe also subjected to optimization with respect to local\nmeasurements [12, 13] and used to quantify the amount\nof entanglement [14, 15].\nThe present results can be viewed as an outcome of a\nmore general research program: experimentally friendly\ndetection/estimation of task-dedicated quantum entangle-\n\n\f2\nment and/or correlations. In fact it is quite usual that\nwe are interested in that aspect of entanglement which is\nuseful for specific quantum information task. The quantity characterizing this aspect may be a monotone but\nwe believe that it need not to be in general. For instance it is known that there are cases when specific Bell\ninequalities which are important for device independent\ncryptography are better violated by nonmaximally entangled states. In this context we believe that the present\nparadigm will lead to systematic development of experimentally friendly detection/estimation of resources for\nquantum information tasks.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we elaborate on lower bounds on distillable entanglement and\ndistillable key. In Sec. III we present a lower bound on\ndistillable key in terms of single parameter, i.e. single privacy witness. An approximate version of this bound is\npresented in Appendix. In Sec. IV we discuss how to infer privacy of a noisy state from the expectation values\nof two observables. Finally, Sec. V concludes the paper.\nII.\n\nKEY BOUNDS\n\nLet us start by reviewing how an individual observable\ncan be used to estimate distillable entanglement ED . The\nmost natural observable in this context is a projector\n\u0174ent = |\u03a8max i h\u03a8max |\n\n(1)\n\nonto a\n1 Pd\n\nmaximally entangled state |\u03a8max i\n=\ni=1 |\u03c6i iA \u2297 |\u03c8i iB of two d-level systems, where\nd\n{|\u03c6i iA } and {|\u03c8i iB } are any two orthonormal bases.\nFollowing the idea of Ref. [3] dealing with the case\nd = 2, there is a protocol for an arbitrary d such that\nif F (\u02c6\n\u033aAB ) = Tr(\u0174ent \u033a\u02c6AB ) = h\u03a8max |\u02c6\n\u033aAB |\u03a8max i satisfies\nF (\u02c6\n\u033aAB ) > d1 then the state \u033a\u02c6AB is distillable [16].\nThe corresponding rate of the distillation protocol can\nbe easily estimated from below by the hashing protocol\n[17, 18] which gives an estimate for the distillable entanglement as\n\u221a\n\nutilizing selected random Pauli operations that brings the\nstate to a form diagonal in the Bell basis:\n\u033a\u02c6Bell\nAB =\n\n4\nX\n\npi |\u03a8i i h\u03a8i |\n\nwhere |\u03a8i i are Bell states. Applying the hashing protocol\nto \u033a\u02c6Bell\nAB leads to:\nED (\u02c6\n\u033aAB ) \u2265 1 \u2212 H(p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 ).\n\n\u2192\n(\u02c6\n\u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 ).\nKD (\u02c6\n\u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 ) \u2265 KDW\n\n(6)\n\nThe Devetak-Winter function is given explicitly by the\ndifference of two Holevo quantities \u03c7AB and \u03c7AE which\ncharacterize the amount of information that can be recovered respectively by Bob and Eve from subsystems B\nand E after Alice carried out a von Neumann measurement of the subsystem A in the secure basis {|iiA }:\n\u2192\n\u02c6cqq\n(\u02c6\n\u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 ) = \u03c7AB (TrE \u033a\u02c6cqq\nKDW\nABE ) \u2212 \u03c7AE (TrB \u033a\nABE ) .\n(7)\nThe state \u033a\u02c6cqq\nABE is given by:\n\n\u033a\u02c6cqq\nABE = TrA\u2032 B \u2032\n\n(2)\n\nwhere S(*) denotes the von Neumann entropy.\nSince an application of the so-called U \u2297 U \u2217 twirling\n[16] can only decrease distillable entanglement ED we\nmay twirl the state \u033a\u02c6AB in order to bring it to a highly\nsymmetric form and then apply the hashing inequality\n(2) which eventually gives:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\u2212F\n1\u2212F\n, (3)\n, ..., 2\nED (\u02c6\n\u033aAB ) \u2265 log2 d \u2212 H F, 2\nd \u22121\nd \u22121\nP\nwhere F = F (\u02c6\n\u033aAB ) and H({pi }) = \u2212 i pi log2 pi is the\nShannon entropy.\nThe above formula is valid for any bipartite quantum\nstate \u033a\u02c6AB . There are more sophisticated twirling protocols. For instance for two qubits there is a protocol [19]\n\n(5)\n\nEqs. (3) and (5) provide bounds on the key rate for \u033a\u02c6AB ,\nas distilled singlet states can be used for the standard\nEkert protocol. In general however, this may be not the\nmost efficient way to generate the key.\nAs pointed out in the introduction, a straighforward\nway to verify that we have a p-bit or a state close to\np-dit enough that the secret key may be distilled. It is\nbased on the so-called quantum state tomography which\nallows to calculate specific entropic functions that can\nbe used to estimate the amount of the secret key from\nbelow.

Sometimes\nthe parameter w may give exactly the value of p1 \u2212 p2 .\nWe will give an instance of that at the end of this section. Let us also stress that the witness itself (14) is an\nobservable which must be measured on the original state\n(9).\nQuantitative estimation of the distillable key will be\nbased on the following inequality\n\u0001\nH(p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 ) \u2264 H p1 , p2 , 12 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 ), 12 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 )\n(16)\napplied to Eq. (13), which yields:\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 h(p1 + p2 )\n\u0001\n\u2212 H p1 , p2 , 12 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 ), 21 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 ) .\n\n(17)\n\nAs we are interested in the most pessimistic scenario, we\nneed to minimize the right hand side over pairs (p1 , p2 )\nthat satisfy all the constraints. This gives the central\nformula:\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212\n\nIII.\n\n1\n2 ||\u00c200,11\n\nsup\np1 \u2212p2 \u2265w\np1 ,p2 \u22650,p1 +p2 \u22641\n\n\u0002\n\nh(p1 + p2 )\n\n\u0001\u0003\n+ H p1 , p2 , 12 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 ), 12 (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 )\n\n(18)\n\nWe found numerically the boundary value w\u2217 at which\nthe above bound becomes strictly positive, i.e. the witness condition w = |h\u0174key i| > w\u2217 , to be equal to\nw\u2217 \u2248 0.907.\nWe can simplify the optimization in Eq. (18) by introducing a new pair of variables p+ = p1 + p2 and\n\u03be+ = p1 /(p1 + p2 ). A straightforward calculation shows\n\n\f4\nthat the bound for the key expressed in the new variables\ntakes the form:\n\u0001\np+ \u2212 2h(p+ ) \u2212 p+ h(\u03be+ ) .

Consequently, the minimization in Eq. (19) needs to be carried out over a single\nparameter p+ :\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\nKD \u2265 inf\np+ \u2212 2h(p+ )\u2212 p+ h (w + p+ )/2p+ . (20)\nw\u2264p+ \u22641\n\nThe absolute minimum of this expression is analyzed in\nAppendix. However we can simplify the bound in two\nways leading to weaker but more compact formulas:\nWeaker bound 1: Suppose that w \u2265 (1 \u2212 w)/3 which\nis equivalent to w \u2265 1/4. Then we have the following\nestimate:\n\u0001\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 h(w) \u2212 H w, 31 (1 \u2212 w), 31 (1 \u2212 w), 31 (1 \u2212 w)\n(21)\nIn the last inequality we have used the fact that both\np1 + p2 \u2265 w and p1 \u2265 w.\nWeaker bound 2: There is a possibility of having another bound with help of subadditivity of the entropy\nH[p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 ] \u2264 h(p1 + p2 ) + h(p1 + p3 ).\n\u0001\n(22)\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 2h(w) \u2212 h 12 (1 + w)\nFor a graphic comparison of the derived formulas see\nFig. 1.\n1.0\n\nIV.\n\nTWO-OBSERVABLE PRIVACY\nESTIMATION\n\nIn this section we will show how to characterize the\nprivacy properties of a noisy entangled state from expectation values of two observables. The first one, given by\nz\nz\n\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n\u2297 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 , characterizes correlations between measurements performed on the subsystems A and B in the\nkey basis. The security of the key will be inferred using\nx\nx\nthe expectation value of an observable \u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n\u2297 \u00dbA\u2032 B \u2032 .\nIn the further discussion it will be convenient to use\nthe following parameterization of \u03c3\u0302AB :\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n0\np+ (\u03be+ \u2212 12 )\n2 p+\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\np\u2212 (\u03be\u2212 \u2212 21 )\n0\n\uf8f7.\n2 p\u2212\n\u03c3\u0302AB = \uf8ec\n1\n1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\np\n0\n0\np\u2212 (\u03be\u2212 \u2212 2 )\n2 \u2212\n1\n0\n0\np\np+ (\u03be+ \u2212 21 )\n2 +\n(23)\nThe nonnegative parameters p+ = p1 + p2 and p\u2212 =\n1 \u2212 p+ = p3 + p4 can be interpreted as occupation probabilities of the correlated and the anticorrelated subspaces,\nspanned respectively by pairs or vectors |00iAB , |11iAB\nand |01iAB , |10iAB . The other two parameters, given\nexplicitly by \u03be+ = p1 /p+ and \u03be\u2212 = p3 /p\u2212 , characterize the off-diagonal elements of \u03c3\u0302AB respectively in the\ncorrelated and the anticorrelated sectors and therefore\ncontain information about the privacy properties. Because the off-diagonal elements of \u03c3\u0302AB are nonnegative\ndue to the definition given in Eq. (11) and must ensure\npositive definiteness of \u03c3\u0302AB , the parameters \u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ satisfy the inequality:\n1\n\u2264 \u03be+ , \u03be\u2212 \u2264 1,\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0.85\n\n0.90\n\n0.95\n\n1.00\n\n-0.5\n\nFIG. 1: Graphs of lower bounds on the distillable key as a\nfunction of w = |h\u0174priv i| derived in Eqs. (18) (solid line),\n(21) (dashed line), and (22) (dotted line).\n\nThe above considerations are based on the ccq scenario, when Alice and Bob measure their qubits in\nthe secure key basis |0i, |1i. However if the shield\npart is not affected by local unitary the optimal \u00db remains unchanged. For instance, in the case of the\nfour-qubit state whose approximate version was realized\nexperimentally in Ref. [8], a two-qubit swap operator\nV\u0302A\u2032 B \u2032 = 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 \u2212 2|\u03a8\u2212 i A\u2032 B \u2032 h\u03a8\u2212 | used in the privacy witness would give exactly the value |h\u0174priv i| = p1 \u2212 p2 .\nNote also that if \u00db were not hermitian, we could decompose \u00db = \u00dbR + i\u00dbI and measure two observables\nR\nI\n\u0174key\n= (|11iAB h00| + |00iAB h11|) \u2297 \u00dbR and \u0174key\n=\n(|11iAB h00| + |00iAB h11|) \u2297 \u00dbI .\n\n(24)\n\ni.e. the relevant region for pairs (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) has the shape of\na square.\nIn the new parameterization, the lower bound on the\nkey takes the following form:\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 2h(p+ ) \u2212 p+ h(\u03be+ ) \u2212 p\u2212 h(\u03be\u2212 ).\n\n(25)\n\nBecause the binary entropies h(\u03be+ ) and h(\u03be\u2212 ) are nonnegative, a necessary condition for this bound to be nontrivial is h(p+ ) < 21 , otherwise the right hand side is\nnot positive. This means that p+ must satisfy either\n0 \u2264 p+ < 1 \u2212 p\u2217 or p\u2217 < p+ \u2264 1, where p\u2217 \u2248 0.89 is\nthe bigger of two solutions of a transcedental equation\nh(p\u2217 ) = 21 on the interval 0 \u2264 p\u2217 \u2264 1. We will restrict\nour further discussion only to the case p\u2217 < p+ \u2264 1,\nas the analysis of the second case 0 \u2264 p+ < 1 \u2212 p\u2217 is\ncompletely analogous.\nLet us now discuss how the parameters of \u03c3\u0302AB are\nrelated to measured observables. The parameters p\u00b1 can\nbe evaluated directly from the measured\nobservables as\n\u0001\nz\nz\np\u00b1 = 21 1 \u00b1 h\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n\u2297 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 i . Following discussion\nafter Eq. (25), we will be interested in the regime when\np+ > p\u2217 . Considering the other regime when p+ < 1 \u2212\np\u2217 effectively boils down to swapping the roles of the\n\n\f5\n\n(26)\n\nfollows from a straightforward fact that the expression\n1\u22122h(p+)\u2212p+ is nonpositive for p\u2217 < p+ \u2264 1. Therefore\nno point with \u03be+ = 21 should satisfy Eq. (31). Because\nthe slope of the line (34) is negative, it is sufficient to\nrequire that the point (\u03be\u2212 = 1, \u03be+ = 21 ) is outside the\nallowed region. This is equivalent to the inequality:\n\n(27)\n\nwx + wz > 1.\n\ncorrelated and the anticorrelated subspaces. These two\npossibilities can be analyzed jointly by defining\nz\nz\nwz := h\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n\u2297 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 i\n\nand using in further discussion\np\u00b1 =\n\n1\n(1 \u00b1 wz ).\n2\n\nThe condition p+ > p\u2217 can be equivalently written as\nwz > 2p\u2217 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.78\n\n(28)\n\nwhich defines the minimum value of wz above which the\nbound on the key can become nontrivial.\nThe second quantity we will use in our analysis will be\nx\nx\nwx := h\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n\u2297 \u00dbA\u2032 B \u2032 i .\n\n(29)\n\nIt allows us to bound the parameters \u03be\u2212 and \u03be+ according\nto the following inequality which will be at the heart of\nour reasoning:\nwx = Tr[\u00db (\u00c200,11 + \u00c201,10 + \u00c210,01 + \u00c211,00 )]\n\u2264 ||\u00c200,11 + \u00c211,00 || + ||\u00c201,10 + \u00c210,01 ||\n= p+ (2\u03be+ \u2212 1) + p\u2212 (2\u03be\u2212 \u2212 1).\n\n(30)\n\nFor fixed p\u00b1 , this inequality determines the allowed region of (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) in the square defined by Eq. (24) as\np\u2212 \u03be\u2212 + p+ \u03be+ \u2265 21 (1 + wx ).\n\n(31)\n\nWhen evaluating the lower bound on the key rate KD\naccording to Eq. (25) we are interested in the worst case\nscenario that is consistent with the measurement results.\nTherefore our task is to minimize the right hand side of\nEq. (25) under constraints given by Eqs. (24) and (31).\nThis is equivalent to maximizing under the same constraints a concave function\nf (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) = p\u2212 h(\u03be\u2212 ) + p+ h(\u03be+ ).\n\n(32)\n\nThe lower bound on the key can be written as\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 2h(p+ ) \u2212 f max ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere f max is the maximum of f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) over the allowed region of parameters. It is useful to note that because f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) is a convex linear combination of binary\nentropies h(\u03be\u2212 ) and h(\u03be+ ), within the square given by\nEq. (24) decreasing either of the arguments \u03be\u2212 or \u03be+ will\nalways increase the value of f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ). This in turn implies that f max is reached on the line\np\u2212 \u03be\u2212 + p+ \u03be+ = 21 (1 + wx ).\n\n(34)\n\nTo proceed with the maximization, let us start from\nan observation that if \u03be+ = 12 , i.e. the correlated sector\nof the density matrix has zero off-diagonal elements, no\npositive key rate can be guaranteed by Eq. (25). This\n\n(35)\n\nFurther analysis depends on whether the point (\u03be\u2212 =\n1\n2 , \u03be+ = 1) is located within the allowed region of parameters. It is easy to verify that this is determined by the\nrelation between p+ and wx . If p+ > wx , this point satisfies Eq. (31) and the allowed region of parameters has\nthe shape of a trapezoid, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Consequently, all values 21 \u2264 \u03be\u2212 \u2264 1 are allowed. On the other\nhand, when p+ \u2264 wx , the allowed region is a triangle, as\ndepicted in Fig. 2(b). The minimum allowed value of \u03be\u2212\nis then (wx \u2212 wz )/(1 \u2212 wz ). We can combine these two\ncases by defining\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1 wx \u2212 wz\nmin\n(36)\n,\n\u03be\u2212 = max\n2 1 \u2212 wz\nThe maximization of f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) over the line defined in\nEq. (34) can now be written as a supremum over a single\nparameter:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 wz\n1 + wx\n(37)\n\u2212\u03be\nf max = sup f \u03be,\n1 + wz\n1 + wz\nmin \u2264\u03be\u22641\n\u03be\u2212\nwhich inserted into Eq. (33) yields the final form of the\nbound:\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 2h(p+ )\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 + wx\n1 \u2212 wz\n(1 \u2212 p+ )h(\u03be) + p+ h\n\u2212 sup\n\u2212\u03be\n1 + wz\n1 + wz\nmin \u2264\u03be\u22641\n\u03be\u2212\n\n(38)\n\nwhere p+ = (1 + wz )/2. The results of a numerical evaluation of the supremum are shown in Fig. 3(a).\nIt is also possible to derive a slightly weaker bound\nthat requires no numerical maximization, which we will\ndenote as f \u0303max . Because the function f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) is monotonic in each one of its two arguments, as discussed after\nEq. (33), we have\nmin min\nf max \u2264 f \u0303max = f (\u03be\u2212\n, \u03be+ ).\n\n(39)\n\nmin\nmin\nwhere \u03be\u2212\nand \u03be+\nare the smallest possible values of\n\u03be\u2212 and \u03be+ within the allowed region defined by Eqs. (24)\nmin\nand (31). The value \u03be\u2212\nhas been given explicitly in\nEq. (36), while it is easy to verify that\nmin\n\u03be+\n=\n\nwx + wz\n.\n1 + wz\n\n(40)\n\nThe simplified bound therefore takes the following explicit form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\nwx + wz\nmin\n\u2212 p+ h\nKD \u2265 1 \u2212 2h(p+ ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 p+ )h \u03be\u2212\n1 + wz\n(41)\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 2: The permitted region of the parameters (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) used\nto maximize the function f (\u03be\u2212 , \u03be+ ) defined in Eq. (32).\n\nFIG. 4: The lower bound on the key given in Eq. (43) obtained\nfrom observables w and wz . The physical region is restricted\nto points (w, wz ) satisfying the condition (1 + wz )/2 \u2265 w.\nThe coding of the bound value is the same as in Fig. 3.\n\nwhich is shown in Fig. 3(b).\nFinally, let us note that the observable w defined in\nEq. (15) can be combined with wz to yield a stronger\nbound on the distillable key. To derive this bound, let us\nreturn to Eq. (25) and estimate the last two terms on the\nright hand side. The inequality shown in Eq. (15) rewritten in the new parametization provides a lower bound on\n\u03be+ :\n\u03be+ \u2265\n\n1\nw\n.\n+\n2 2p+\n\n(42)\n\nBecause the right hand side is greater or equal 1/2, we\nhave h(\u03be+ ) \u2264 h(1/2 + w/2p+ ). Further, we obviously\nhave h(\u03be\u2212 ) \u2264 1. This yields:\nKD \u2265 p+ [1 \u2212 h (1/2 + w/2p+ )] \u2212 2h (p+ ) .\n\n(43)\n\nLet us note that physical values of w and wz must satisfy\nthe condition (1 + wz )/2 \u2265 w, otherwise we would have\np1 +p2 = p+ = (1+wz )/2 < w \u2264 p1 \u2212p2 and consequently\np2 < 0. In Fig. 4 we depict the bound (43) in the physical\nregion of w and wz .\nV.\n\nFIG. 3: The lower bound on the key as a function of wx and\nwz obtained from (a) full optimization over the free parameters specified in Eq. (38) and (b) a weaker estimate according\nto Eq. (41). The bound is positive in the shaded area, with\nsolid contours drawn at steps 0.1 starting from 0.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have introduced a privacy witness, i.e.\nan observable, whose mean value allows one to estimate\nnontrivially from below the amount of secret key, even in\nthe case when the resulting state exhibits the separation\nof the secret key and the distillable entanglement. In fact\nthis separation may be quite drastic while the witness is\nworking perfectly. To see this let us take A\u2032 B \u2032 being\n\n\f7\nd \u2297 d-level systems and consider a p-bit state \u033aABA\u2032 B \u2032 in\nthe form [6]\n\u033a\u02c6ABA\u2032 B \u2032 =\n\n1 \u0002\n(|00i AB h00| + |11i AB h11|) \u2297 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032\n2d2\ni\n\n+ (|00iAB h11| + |11iAB h00|) \u2297 V\u0302A\u2032 B \u2032\n\n(44)\n\nwhere 1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 and V\u0302A\u2032 B \u2032 stand respectively for bipartite\nidentity and swap operator on the subsystems A\u2032 B \u2032 .\nIn the limit of large d the distillable entanglement is\nbounded by vanishing log-negativity ED \u2264 log2 (1+ d1 ) \u2192\ny\ny\nx\nx\n0, while the privacy witness W = (\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n+ \u03c3\u0302A\n\u2297 \u03c3\u0302B\n)\u2297\n\u2032\n\u2032\nV\u0302A B gives us the value of lower bound KD \u2265 1 since\nw = T r(\u0174 \u033a\u02c6ABA\u2032 B \u2032 ) = 1 and then just either of the\nweaker bounds given in Eqs. (21) or (22) does the job.\nNote in particular that since the key part AB is a two\nqubit part the above estimate gives the maximum possible value of the secret key KD = log2 2 = 1 despite\nthe fact that the distillable entanglement of the state is\nalmost zero!\nIn general the complexity of measuring the privacy witness is related to the Hilbert-Schmidt decomposition of\nthe hermitian operator \u00db used to construct the witness\n[12]. In the case of the four qubit state that was studied in the experiment reported in Ref. [8] the operator in\nquestion is the swap operator which is composed of three\nterms involving products of Pauli matrices:\nV\u0302A\u2032 B \u2032 =\n\n1\ny\ny\nx\nx\nz\nz\n(1\u03021A\u2032 B \u2032 +\u03c3\u0302A\n\u2032 \u2297\u03c3\u0302B \u2032 +\u03c3\u0302A\u2032 \u2297\u03c3\u0302B \u2032 +\u03c3\u0302A\u2032 \u2297\u03c3\u0302B \u2032 ). (45)\n2\n\nTaking into account the necessary measurements on the\nkey part this gives in total 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 observables to be\nmeasured, each formed by a product of four Pauli matrices. This is dramatically less then the full tomography\nwhich requires 81 products of four Pauli matrices. Note\nthat in some cases, like the p-bit state discussed above,\nsuch an apparently poor measurement has no problem\nin reporting the key value that lies above the distillable\nentanglement, which is bounded for our example by the\nlog negativity value ED (\u033a) \u2264 log2 (1 + 12 ) \u2248 0.585.\nThe above approach may be extended to higher dimensions and other twirling techniques may be applied. It\nmay be especially useful when the experimentalist has a\ngood guess about the expected p-bit he state in the laboratory then he or she may estimate the high key contents\nalmost perfectly even if there is virtually no distillable\nentanglement in the system. Finally let us note that\nthe very difficult problem is to find the nonlinear entanglement witness that would capture collective behavior\nrevealing the key in all the cases when any single-copy\nentropic fuction based on a one-way protocol fails. It\nseems that for this one needs quantum secrecy distillation protocols of new generation.\nWe believe that the present approach will lead to\ngeneral and systematic development of experimentally\nfriendly methods for detection and estimation of taskdedicated quantum entanglement and other resources.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by 7th Framework Programme Future and Emerging Technologies projects\nCORNER (no. 213681) and Q-ESSENCE (no. 248095).\nK.H. is supported by grant BW no. 538-5300-0637-1,\nP.H. is supported by NN 202-261-938.

This is a\ncubic equation which can be solved exactly, but a simplified formula can be found by substituting p+ = w +\u03b4 and\nassuming that \u03b4 \u226a 1\u2212w which is motivated by numerical\nanalysis. This yields \u03b4 \u2248 (1 \u2212 w)4 /2w3 and consequently\nthe bound on the key in the approximate form\nKD\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 \u2212 w)4\n.\n\u2265\u03ba w+\n2w3\n\n(A3)\n\nThis approximate expression turns out to reproduce the\noriginal bound quite tightly, as evidenced in Fig. 5 depicting the difference between Eq.
