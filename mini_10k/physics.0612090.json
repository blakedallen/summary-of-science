The vanishing of the four-divergence of the current density is thus not an\n1\n\n\fordinary conservation law (i.e., a 'weak' conservation law subject to the field\nequations being satisfied) but an identity (i.e., a so-called strong conservation law)\nwhich has to be satisfied even if J\u03bc is a distribution rather than a smooth function. This conclusion is absolutely general and should therefore be true for an\narbitrarily moving relativistic point-charge, that is for the charge-current density\nof the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert field, which turns out not to be the case for the customary\nformulation of this field.\nIn this letter we show that if the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert charge-current density\nis properly calculated, which implies that the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert field-strength\nmust be supplemented by an additional \u03b4-function-like field, local charge-current\nconservation is restored. This conclusion is obtained by using only well known\nphysical concepts, and a few basic results of distribution theory, but at the expense\nof some lengthy calculations whose details are given in another paper [1], to which\nwe refer for all results presented here.\n\n2\n\nDefinitions\n\nLet Z\u03bc be the four-position of an arbitrarily moving relativistic point-charge, and\nX\u03bc a point of observation. At the point X\u03bc the four-potential A\u03bc , field F\u03bc\u03bd , and\nfour-current density J\u03bc are functions of the null interval R\u03bc between X\u03bc and Z\u03bc ,\ni.e.,\nR\u03bc := X\u03bc \u2212 Z\u03bc ,\n\nsuch that\n\nR\u03bc R\u03bc = 0,\n\n(2.1)\n\n...\nas well as of the four-velocity Z \u0307\u03bc , four-acceleration Z \u0308\u03bc , and four-biacceleration\nZ\n... \u03bc\nof the charge, to which three invariants are associated: \u017b\u03bc R\u03bc , Z\u0308\u03bc R\u03bc , and Z \u03bc R\u03bc .\nThe first one is called the retarded distance,\n\u03be := \u017b\u03bc R\u03bc ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich enables to introduce a 'unit' null four-vector K\u03bc defined as\nK\u03bc (\u03b8, \u03c6) := R\u03bc /\u03be,\nand the so-called acceleration and biacceleration invariants defined as\n...\n\u03ba := Z\u0308\u03bc K \u03bc ,\nand\n\u03c7 := Z \u03bc K \u03bc .\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe derivations of F\u03bc\u03bd from the four-potential, i.e.,\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ,\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fand of J\u03bc according to (1.2), require that the partial derivatives are calculated at\nthe the position X\u03bc under the condition R\u03bc R\u03bc = 0, which insures causality. For\nan expression E = E(X\u03bc , \u03c4 ), where the argument X\u03bc corresponds to an explicit\ndependence on X\u03bc , and \u03c4 to the proper time, this condition leads to the covariant\ndifferentiation rule\n\u2202\u03bc E(X\u03bc , \u03c4 ) = \u2202\u03bc E(X\u03bc ) + K\u03bc \u0116(\u03c4 )\n\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn this equation the condition \u03c4 = \u03c4r implies that all quantities are evaluated at\nthe retarded proper time \u03c4r . In the following, for simplicity, this condition will be\nspecified explicitly only for the main equations.\n\n3\n\nThe customary formulation\n\nThe potential of the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert field field can be obtained by a number\nof methods that are explained in many text books, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Most\nfrequently it is obtained by working in the Lorentz gauge, and by means of a\nGreen's function assuming that the point-charge can be represented by a threedimensional \u03b4-function. In the covariant notation of this letter this source chargecurrent density can be written in the following form\nJ\u03bcS =\n\ne\n1\n\u017b\u03bc 2 \u03b4(\u03be),\n4\u03c0 \u03be\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhose normalization corresponds to the global (or integral) form of charge conservation, i.e.,\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c6\nd\u03b8 sin \u03b8\nd\u03be \u03be 2 J\u03bc = e\u017b\u03bc .\n(3.2)\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThe resulting potential has the remarkable simple form\nALW\n\u03bc = e\n\n\u017b\u03bc\n\u03be\n\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n,\n\nfrom which, applying the rule (2.6), it is easily found that\ni\nh K Z\u0308\nK\u03bc \u017b\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\nLW\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03be) 2 \u2212 {\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd}\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n=e\n,\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere {\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd} means two more terms with \u03bc and \u03bd interchanged. Using again\nthe rule (2.6) the corresponding charge-current density calculated according to\n(1.2) is then\nZ\u0308\u03bc \u2212 \u03ba\u017b\u03bc i\ne h \u017b\u03bc\nLW\n.\n(3.5)\n\u03b4(\u03be)\n+2\nJ\u03bc =\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n4\u03c0 \u03be 2\n\u03be\n3\n\n\fThis current differs from (3.1) by the presence of two additional terms which\ndepend on the acceleration. However, when integrated over the whole three-space\nas in (3.2), J\u03bcLW yields the same total current e\u017b\u03bc as J\u03bcS , because after multiplication\nby the volume element these acceleration dependent terms do not contribute to the\nradial integral since \u03be\u03b4(\u03be) = 0. Therefore, as distributions, the current densities\n(3.1) and (3.5) are equivalent.\nUnfortunately, if one tries to verify that the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert field chargecurrent density J\u03bcLW is locally conserved, and consistently uses again the differentiation rule (2.6), one finds\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bcLW =\n\ne\n1\n2\u03ba 2 \u03b4(\u03be) 6= 0.\n4\u03c0 \u03be\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis result is not identically zero as it should be according\nto (1.1). Also it is\nR\n2 \u03bc LW\ndistributionally non-zero and well-defined because d\u03be \u03be \u2202 J\u03bc is finite. The\ncurrent density J LW is therefore not locally conserved. Moreover, if instead of\nJ\u03bcLW one tries to verify local conservation for J\u03bcS defined by (3.1) one also finds\nthat it is not locally conserved, i.e.,\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bcS = \u2212\n\ne\n1\n2\u03ba 2 \u03b4(\u03be) 6= 0.\n4\u03c0 \u03be\n\n(3.7)\n\nTherefore, even if the additional term in J\u03bcLW is discarded to get J\u03bcS , what is the\nusual practice in distribution theory, the divergence is still non-zero. Only when\n\u03ba = 0, i.e., for non-accelerated motion, are these two current densities locally\nconserved. This means that something is wrong in the customary formulation of\nthe electrodynamics of an arbitrarily moving point-charge, or else that something\nis mathematically inconsistent and needs to be clarified.\n\n4\n\nThe locally conserved current\n\nBefore explaining the reasons of the non local-conservation of the current J\u03bcLW , let\nus find out under which conditions the potential (3.3) leads to a locally conserved\ncurrent. In view of this we remark that any current distribution of the general form\nJ\u03bc (X) =\n\n\u0011\ne \u0010 \u017b\u03bc S\u03bc\n+\n+\nT\n\u03bc \u03b4(\u03be),\n4\u03c0 \u03be 2\n\u03be\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere S\u03bc and T\u03bc are any smooth four-vector functions, will satisfy global charge\nconservation because of the distributional identity \u03be\u03b4(\u03be) = 0. We therefore\nsuppose that the origin of the absence of local current conservation could be\ndue to an incorrect handling of the singularity at \u03be = 0, which should in fact lead\nto a current having a more complicated form than (3.1) or (3.5).\n4\n\n\fTo proceed step by step and be fully general, we begin by replacing the 1/\u03be\nfactor in the potential (3.3) by a function \u03c6(\u03be) that is finite and differentiable a\nsufficient number of times n, except possibly at \u03be = 0, i.e.,\nA\u03bc := e\u017b\u03bc (\u03c4 )\u03c6(\u03be)\n\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n,\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 C n , \u2200\u03be 6= 0.\n\n(4.2)\n\nMoreover, in order to make gauge invariance explicit, we write the equation for\nthe current density J\u03bc directly in terms of A\u03bc , i.e.,\n4\u03c0J\u03bc = \u2202\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c8,\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c8 = \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bd ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nis the invariant scalar which is set equal to zero in the Lorentz gauge. After a long\nbut elementary calculation we find\n1\n\u03c61 := \u03c6\u2032 + \u03c6,\n\u03be\n1\n\u2202\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc = e2Z\u0308\u03bc \u03c61 (\u03be) \u2212 e(1 \u2212 2\u03ba\u03be)\u017b\u03bc (\u03c6\u20321 + \u03c61 ),\n\u03be\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 = e(Z\u0308\u03bc + \u03be\u03c7K\u03bc )\u03c61 (\u03be) + e\u03ba\u03be (1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03be)K\u03bc + \u017b\u03bc \u03c6\u20321 (\u03be).\n\u03c8 = e\u03ba\u03be\u03c61 (\u03be),\n\nwhere\n\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nBy a tedious calculation we can then explicitly verify that \u2202 \u03bc J\u03bc \u2261 0 when Z\u03bc (\u03c4 )\nand \u03c6(\u03be) are any three times differentiable functions, provided \u03be 6= 0.\nThe next step is then to take for \u03c6(\u03be) a distribution rather than a C n function,\nand to require that the current density J\u03bc must still be locally conserved, even if\n\u03be = 0. Specifically, we consider \u03c6 = 1/\u03be for which\n\u2200\u03be > 0,\n\n\u03c61 (\u03be) = \u2212\n\n1\n1\n+ 2 = 0,\n2\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\n(4.7)\n\nso that that equations (4.4) to (4.6) are all zero when \u03be 6= 0. The current density\nJ\u03bc is thus everywhere zero, except at \u03be = 0 where it is undefined. We therefore\ninterpret \u03c61 (\u03be) as a distribution, and use the theorem stating that a distribution\nwhich has its support only in one point, say the origin, is a linear combination of\nthe \u03b4-function and its derivatives up to a certain order [7, p 784]. Thus\n1\n\u2200\u03be > 0,\n\u03c61 (\u03be) = \u03b4(\u03be),\n(4.8)\n\u03be\nwhich because of dimensionality comprises a single \u03b4-function, and whose normalization will turn out to be consistent with (3.2). It remains to substitute this\nexpression in (4.5) and (4.6), and the locally conserved current-density (4.3) is\nfinally found to be\n\u0011\ne \u0010 \u017b\u03bc Z\u0308\u03bc + 2\u03baK\u03bc\n2\nJ\u03bc =\n+\n\u2212 (2\u03ba + \u03c7)K\u03bc \u03b4(\u03be)\n.\n(4.9)\n4\u03c0 \u03be 2\n\u03be\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\nThis leads to several observations:\n5\n\n\f1. The structure of the current density J\u03bc is much more complicated than that\nof the customary current (3.1). J\u03bc depends directly on the three invariants\n\u03be, \u03ba, and \u03c7, as well\n... as on the two four-vectors \u017b\u03bc and Z\u0308\u03bc ; indirectly on\nthe biacceleration Z \u03bc through the invariant \u03c7; and, finally, on the angular\nvariables through the null four-vector K\u03bc (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n2. The dependence on the third derivative of Z\u03bc is consistent with the LorentzDirac\nequation and with the Schott expression of the self-force, in which\n...\nalso\nappears, because the self-interaction force involves a product of J\u03bc\nZ\u03bc\nwith the self-field.\n3. Equation (4.9) has the most general distributional form of (4.1), in accord\nwith the theorem cited above (4.8).\n4. The equation \u03c61 (\u03be) = \u03c6\u2032 + \u03c6/\u03be = 0, \u2200\u03be 6= 0, has only one solution: 1/\u03be.\nThis singles out the corresponding potential as being the only one such that\nthe current density of a point-charge is conserved and thus given by (4.9).\n\n5\n\nStraightforward derivation\n\nWhile the derivation made in the previous section is rigorous, it is indirect in\nthe sense that it gives no explanation for the origin of the \u03b4-functions, which\nlike any distribution must by Schwarz's structure theorem come from the partial\ndifferentiation of some continuous function. In fact, this generating function is\neasily found because in three-dimensional notation the retarded distance (2.2)\nreads\n~\n\u03be = |~x \u2212 ~z |\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03c1~ * \u03b2),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03c1~ is the unit vector in the direction of ~x \u2212 ~z. The retarded distance is\ntherefore proportional to an absolute value, and for that reason has a discontinuous\nderivative when ~x \u2192 ~z , i.e., at \u03be = 0 where a second partial differentiation leads\nto a \u03b4-function.\nConsequently, as a direct generalization of the case of a point-charge at rest,\nwhich is discussed in details in [8, 9, 10], the potential of an arbitrarily moving\naccelerated point-charge can be written\nA\u03bc = e\n\n\u017b\u03bc\n\u03a5(\u03be)\n\u03be\n\n6\n\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n,\n\n(5.2)\n\n\fwhere \u03a5(\u03be) is the generalized function defined as1\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2undefined r < 0,\n\u03a5(r) := 0\nand\nr = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n+1\nr > 0,\n\nd\n\u03a5(r) = \u03b4(r),\ndr\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhich explicitly specifies how to consistently differentiate at \u03be = 0.\nWhen the definition (2.5) and the causal differentiation rule (2.6) are now used\nto calculate the field strength starting from the potential (5.2), the corresponding\ncurrent-density (1.2) is directly found to be the conserved one, i.e., (4.9). However,\ninstead of the customary Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert field (3.4), the field strength is now\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 K Z\u0308\nK\u03bc \u017b\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03be) 2 \u2212 {\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd} \u03a5(\u03be)\n=e\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\u0011\n\u0010\nK\u03bc \u017b\u03bd\n,\n\u2212 {\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd} \u03b4(\u03be)\n\u2212 e (1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03be)\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\u03be\n\n(5.4)\n\u03c4 =\u03c4r\n\n(5.5)\n\nLW\nwhich apart from the presence of the \u03a5-function multiplying F\u03bc\u03bd\non the first\nline, has an additional \u03b4-like contribution on the second line. This field is the\nproper relativistic generalization of the Coulomb-Tangherlini field of a pointcharge [8, 9, 10]. Since both the \u03a5-factor and the \u03b4-like contribution are necessary\nto obtain the current density satisfying the local conservation identity (1.1), it\nLW\nbecomes clear why the customary F\u03bc\u03bd\ncannot lead to such a current. In fact, it is\nby calculating the current density immediately from the potential as in (4.3) - that\nis by ignoring that the field could be different from the customary one - that after\nmany unsuccessful attempts the author discovered the conserved current-density\nin July 2003.\nThe implication of the necessity of the \u03b4-like contribution (5.5) to get an\nidentically conserved charge-current density is that the field (5.4\u20135.5) cannot be\ninterpreted as a distribution in which (5.5) can be ignored if the field is twice\ndifferentiated to calculate the divergence (1.1). The reason is that every successive\ndifferentiation introduces new terms which must be retained in order to get a result\nthat is identically zero.2 The field (5.4\u20135.5) and the current density (4.9) must\ntherefore be interpreted as nonlinear generalized function, such as Colombeau\nfunctions [9], in which all terms can be or can become significative in further\ncalculations, even though none of the nonlinear properties of such functions are\nused in the present letter.\n1\n\nIntuitively, \u03a5(r) can be seen as equivalent to the sign function sgn(r) for r \u2265 0.\nThis can be illustrated by the following example: the function f (\u03be) = \u03be \u22121 \u03b4(\u03be) yields zero\nwhen evaluated on any test function T (\u03be) in R3 . On the other hand, f \u2032 (\u03be) = \u22122\u03be \u22122 \u03b4(\u03be) yields\n\u22122T (0) 6= 0 so that differentiation and evaluation on test functions do not commute in general.\n2\n\n7\n\n\f6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this letter we have derived the proper formulation of the potential of an arbitrarily moving point-charge (5.2), which leads to the conserved current-density\n(4.9), which, most probably, has never been published. This means that there is\nan apparent contradiction between this new result and the fact that the customary Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert formulation is an agreement with so many applications of\nclassical electrodynamics.\nThere is however no contradiction, since, on the contrary, the results of this\nletter are in full agreement with the fundamental principles of electrodynamics\nand mechanics. For instance, if the conserved current (4.9) is introduced in an\naction integral as a scalar product J\u03bc A\u03bcext with the potential of an external field\nA\u03bcext \u2208 C \u221e (R4 ), the differences between that current and the simple current J\u03bcS\ndefined by (3.1) have in general no influence since they disappear upon integration\nover the whole space. The same is true for the calculation (which also involves\nan integration) of the Li\u00e9nard-Wiechert potential, i.e., (3.2) or (5.2), by means of\na Green's function.\nThus, the principles of physics imply that the position Z\u03bc and velocity \u017b\u03bc of a\npoint-charge are sufficient to determine the potential of its field, while the precise\nformulation of that potential given by (5.2) is necessary to determine the complete\nfield...and conserved current-density, which include terms that are function of Z\u0308\u03bc\nand Z \u03bc . In other words, while J\u03bcS is sufficient as a source to determine uniquely the\npotential of an arbitrarily moving point-charge, the conserved current J\u03bc deriving\nfrom this potential can be very different from J\u03bcS . Indeed, without the factor e, J\u03bcS\nis merely a velocity distribution associated to the world-line of the point-charge.\nIn conclusion, the formulation presented in this letter will make little difference\nin most engineering-type applications of classical electrodynamics. Indeed, as can\nbe seen by studying a number of examples, the instances in which the full details\nof the current density (4.9) are strictly necessary, and the additional contribution\n(5.5) to the field is essential, include fundamental problems like calculating the interaction of a point-charge with itself [10], and similar problems in which classical\nelectrodynamics is apparently not consistent. For example, the self-force on an\narbitrarily moving point-charge is given by F\u03bc\u03bd J \u03bd where F\u03bc\u03bd is given by (5.4\u20135.5)\nand J \u03bd is the full conserved current density (4.9), i.e., such that \u2202 \u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd = \u22124\u03c0J\u03bc ,\nnot the customary charge-current density (3.1): a frequent confusion which is a\ncause of known difficulties. The resolution of such internal contradictions is the\nsubject of several forthcoming publications [11, 12].\n\n8\n\n\f7\n\nReferences\n1. A.
