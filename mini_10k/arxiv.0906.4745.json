This direct Potts segmentation technique is demonstrated on photographic,\nmedical, and acoustic images.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSegmenting digital images into regions of distinct types\nhas applications in a great many fields, e.g. medical\nimaging [1\u20134], surveillance by synthetic aperture radar\n[6] and satellite, and underwater acoustic imaging (.e.g.\nsee Ref. 7), to name a few. In general, image segmentation is performed by classifying image regions by color,\nintensity, and texture. Of course, only the latter two are\nconsidered in grayscale segmentation, which is the subject we consider in this article. While classification by\nintensity is a straightforward assessment of the brightness/darkness of an image pixel or group of pixels (as\nwith histogram segmentation methods [1]), texture classification is much more complex [1, 8]. Although it is difficult to define image texture precisely, we can say that it\nis the spatial relationship of the intensities (i.e. \"graininess\") of an image region. Clearly, there are indeed a\nlarge number of possible texture types in digital images.\nA grayscale digital image may be represented as a matrix of numerical values, as in Fig. 1, which indicate the\nintensity or brightness (gray level) of the corresponding\nimage pixel. Techniques for image segmentation (such as\nthresholding and histogram methods) that focus solely\non intensity are the most computationally efficient since\nthey generally require just one or two passes through the\nintensity matrix. Identifying regions of different texture,\nhowever, tend to be relatively expensive in terms of computation time [8]. Here I describe four types of magnetism using the Ising model [9] and show how its gener-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Present\n\naddress: frank.bentrem@nrlssc.navy.mil\naddress\n\nalization, the Q-Ising (or Potts) model [10], can be used\nanalogously to segment grayscale images into four categories [11]. The common approach (e.g. see [3, 6, 12, 13])\nto segmentation using the Potts model applies the Potts\nmodel to the categorizing labels, i.e., the segmented image. (A similar approach is also used for more general\ndata clustering [14, 15].) The optimal segmentation is\noften found using a Monte Carlo approach, which processes in exponential time (time for computer processing\nincreases exponentially with the number of pixels contained in the digital image [12]). Use of the Bethe approximation [12, 16] allows an optimal segmentation to\nbe obtained in power-law time. However, the direct Potts\nsegmentation method presented in this article, which\nutilizes both intensity and texture, processes in linear\ntime\u2013among the fastest methods currently used. (Other\nunrelated linear-time or nearly linear-time segmentation\nmethods are described in [17\u201319], though, these contain\nundesirable feature for many applications. For example,\ngraph partitioning methods [18, 19] cannot relate disjoint\nsets with equivalent textures and require training sets.)\nThis computational speedup arises from applying the\nPotts model directly to the original image itself rather\nthan to the segmented representation. The speedup is\nimportant for high-data-volume/high-resolution applications where time is constrained.\n\nII.\n\nISING MODEL\n\nIn 1925, Ernst Ising proposed the model [9, 20, 21],\nwhich now bears his name, as a means to study phase\ntransitions in magnetism. Ising solved the original Ising\nmodel (only two states\u2013namely 1, or spin up, and -1,\nor spin down) in one dimension. However, the one-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: On left, a grayscale image varies from black to white\nin going from top to bottom. The image is represented as a\nmatrix of intensity values as illustrated on the right.\n\ndimensional Ising model did not exhibit a phase transition, and the two-dimensional Ising model was not solved\nuntil 1944. At that time Onsager [22] demonstrated that\nthe two-dimensional Ising model did, in fact, exhibit an\norder/disorder phase transition. The Ising model and related models have been widely used to study magnetism\nand other order/disorder phenomena in physical systems.\nThe two-dimensional model is described here, and it will\nbe used to define four classes of magnetism. The image\ntexture analogs will be presented in a subsequent section.\nIn the Ising model, given a two-dimensional lattice of\nmagnetic spins oriented either up or down as in Fig. 2\n(numerically represented as a matrix of 1's and \u22121's),\nthe total energy E associated with the lattice is\nE = \u2212\u03bcH\n\nX\ni\n\nsi \u2212 J\n\nX\n\nsi sj ,\n\n(1)\n\nij, nn\n\nwhere i represents a magnetic element, si is the value\nof the magnetic spin of i (1 or \u22121), \u03bc is the magnetic\nmoment of the element, H is the external magnetic field,\nand J is the interaction coupling constant. The sum\nP over\nall nearest-neighbors pairs i,j is represented by ij, nn .\nNearest neighbors are considered to be the elements directly above, below, left, and right of a given element.\nIf no coupling interaction is present (J = 0) then \u03bc > 0\ncreates an energetically favorable condition for the spins\nto align in the direction of the external field H, whereas\n\u03bc < 0 leads to spins aligned in the direction opposite of\nH. (See Fig. 3.)\nIII.\n\nFOUR CLASSES OF MAGNETISM\n\nIn common language, magnetism usually refers to the\nbehavior of magnets that attract iron (known as ferromagnets). Other materials, however, reveal different\nmagnetic behavior. These behaviors may be classified\ninto the following four groups:\n1. Ferromagnetism is exhibited by materials for\nwhich, even in the absence of an external magnetic\n\nFIG. 2: A spin matrix is shown on the left with arrows indicating elements whose magnetic states are either spin-up\nand spin-down. The matrix on the right represents the same\nmatrix with the arrows exchanged for 1's and (-1)'s. In the\nabsence of an external magnetic field (H = 0), a ferromagnet's spins will spontaneously align as depicted in the top half\nof the matrices, while the spins for antiferromagnets will oppositely align (alternate in opposite directions) as depicted in\nthe bottom half of the matrices.\n\nFIG. 3: Magnetic spins are aligned with (left, top) and against\n(left, bottom) the magnetic field H. These regions are associated with paramagnetism and diamagnetism, respectively.\n\nfield, a net magnetization is present with north and\nsouth poles. A ferromagnet will both attract and\nrepel another ferromagnet depending on the alignment of their poles.\n2. Antiferromagnetism is displayed by materials\nwhich do not form magnetic poles even with a modest external magnetic field present. An antiferromagnet will neither attract nor repel another antiferromagnet. Likewise an antiferromagnet will have\nno magnetic interaction with a ferromagnet.\n3. Paramagnetism shows no spin ordering in the absence of an external field, although the paramagnet's spins align in the same direction of an external field when present. A paramagnet will neither\nattract nor repel another paramagnet, but will be\nattracted to a ferromagnet\n4. Diamagnetism also shows no ordering in the absence of an external field; however, the diamagnet's\nspins will align in the opposite direction of any external field. A diamagnet will neither attract nor\n\n\f3\nrepel another diamagnet and will be repelled by a\nferromagnet.\nIV.\n\nspins that may or may not belong to A\u03b1. Then the total\nenergy E is simply the sum over all regions,\nE=\n\nQ-ISING MODEL\n\nX\n\nE\u03b1 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1\n\nThis section describes the Q-Ising model, also known\nas the Potts model, which will be used to analyze\ngrayscale images where the pixel intensities are considered in place of the magnetic \"spin\" values. The Potts\nmodel generalizes the (2-state) Ising model into a Q-state\nmodel by replacing the 1's and -1's with the numbers\n0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , Q \u2212 1 (the pixel intensities in a grayscale\nimage). According to this model, the total energy associated with the system is\nX\n\nE = \u2212\u03bcH\n\nX\n\n(si \u2212 st ) \u2212 J\n\n\u03b4(si , sj )\n\n(2)\n\nij, nn\n\ni\n\nwhere st is the spin threshold (separating light from dark\nwith 0 < st < Q \u2212 1) and the kronecker delta function\n\u03b4 (1 if the elements are equal, 0 otherwise) replaces the\nsummand for the second summation in Eq. 1. Now lets\nsuppose that a magnetic spin matrix represents the intensities in a grayscale image and that a uniform external\nmagnetic field, H = 1, is applied to the system. We wish\nto find a set of pairs (\u03bc\u03b1 , J\u03b1 ) for Eq. 2 which characterizes the regions \u03b1 in the spin matrix. Then each spin in\nthe matrix will be associated with a particular parameter\npair. The \"optimal characterization\" is taken to be the\npartitioning of the spin matrix in such a way that the total energy of the matrix is minimized. Minimizing Eq. 2\nrequires the set of four parameter pairs (\u03bc > 0, J > 0),\n(\u03bc > 0, J < 0), (\u03bc < 0, J > 0), and (\u03bc < 0, J < 0). For\nconvenience, and without loss of generality, we simply use\n(\u03bc1 = 1, J1 = 1), (\u03bc2 = 1, J2 = \u22121), (\u03bc3 = \u22121, J3 = 1),\nand (\u03bc4 = \u22121, J4 = \u22121) for what we will call regions\n\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. The energies for the regions\ncan be written as\nE1 = \u2212\n\nE2 = \u2212\n\nX\n\n(si \u2212 st ) \u2212\n\ni\u2208A1\n\ni\u2208A1,j\u2208nn\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(si \u2212 st ) +\n\ni\u2208A2\n\nE3 =\n\nE4 =\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(si \u2212 st ) \u2212\n\nX\ni\u2208A3,j\u2208nn\n\nX\n\nX\n\ni\u2208A4\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b4(si , sj ),\n\n(4)\n\ni\u2208A2,j\u2208nn\n\ni\u2208A3\n\n(si \u2212 st ) +\n\n\u03b4(si , sj ),\n\n\u03b4(si , sj ),\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the region segments assigned to\ncategories 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. These energies correspond to regions which are 1) paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, 2) paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic, 3)\ndiamagnetic and ferromagnetic, and 4) diamagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic. Minimizing the total energy (Eq. 7)\neffectively partitions the spin matrix into regions corresponding to these four classes of magnetism. Reverting\nback to the grayscale image, these categories correspond\nto image regions which are 1) bright and smooth, 2)\nbright and \"grainy\", 3) dark and smooth, and 4) dark and\n\"grainy\". The direct Potts segmentation process requires\nthe matrix to be separated into regions of these four types\nin such a way as to minimize the total energy. An example image with four distinct intensity and texture regions\nis depicted in Fig. 4a and the result from the direct Potts\nsegmentation is shown in Fig. 4b. The parameters used\nin this example are Q = 16 and st = 7.5, and the segmented image is shown with four shades of gray representing the four texture categories. The segmented image\nis filtered using the ImageMagick[28] despeckle algorithm\nand is shown in Fig. 4c. For comparison, a segmented image using a simple four-level histogram method is shown\nin Fig. 4d. The four-level histogram method performs\npoorly in distinguishing the image texture regions.\n\nV.\n\nALGORITHM\n\nTo segment a digital grayscale image, we first transform the image into a matrix of intensity values si,j\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. Since it is common for 8bit digital grayscale images to contain 256 gray levels\n(0 \u2264 si,j \u2264 255), reducing the gray levels to 16 \u2264 Q \u2264 64\nusually helps in identifying visual textures. Next we must\nspecify an intensity threshold st , which separates bright\npixels from dark pixels. For each of the examples in this\narticle, the threshold is simply st = (Q \u2212 1)/2, or halfway\nbetween maximum and minimum intensity. (If texture\nidentification at a certain scale is desired, one may rescale\nthe image.) Then to perform the energy minimization described above, we follow these two steps for each of the\nimage pixels (i, j):\n\n(5)\n1. If si,j > st then (i, j) is assigned either texture category 1 or category 2. Otherwise, (i, j) is assigned\ntexture category 3 or 4.\n\n\u03b4(si , sj ),\n\n(6)\n\ni\u2208A4,j\u2208nn\n\nwhere A\u03b1 is the set of all spins i labeled with category\n\u03b1. The j's in the interaction terms are nearest-neighbor\n\n2. Check the nearest-neighbor values (i.e., the pixels\ndirectly above, below, left, and right) of pixel (i, j).\nIf one or more nearest-neighbor values are equal to\nsi,j , then pixel (i, j) is assigned texture category\n\n\f4\ncal noise in the image.\n\nVI.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 4: Sample grayscale image (a) with regions of visibly\ndistinct intensity and texture. Upper right (b) is the segmented image using the direct Potts method with Q = 16\nand st = 7.5. At lower left (c), the segmented image from\n(a) is filtered with a despeckle algorithm to reveal four distinct texture categories. The categories are bright and smooth\n(white), bright and grainy (light gray), dark and grainy (dark\ngray), and dark and smooth (black).

Otherwise, (i, j) is assigned either texture\ncategory 2 or category 4).\nThis algorithm guarentees that the total energy defined\nby Eq. 7 is minimized and processes in linear time since\neach pixel requires only a fixed number of computations.\nOnly a single comparison and assignment required in\nStep 1, and a maximum of four comparisons (nearest\nneighbors) and assignment required in Step 2. Note that\nsince the energy associated with each pixel is independent\nof the labeling of its neighbors, choosing an energy minimum for every pixel guarantees a total energy minimum\n(Eq. 7) for the entire image. Finally, the segmented image is smoothed by applying the ImageMagick despeckle\nalgorithm. This serves to eliminate much of the statisti-\n\nRESULTS\n\nThree examples using the direct Potts segmentation\nwill now be discussed using a photographic image, a medical image, and an acoustic seafloor image. Each segmentation result is compared to a histogram segmentation\ntechnique in which the image is partitioned into four uniformly distributed intensity ranges. The four-level histogram method is a very efficient, linear-time process but\ndoes not distinguish grainy regions from smooth regions.\nThe photographic image in Fig. 5a[29] contains depictions of water, sky, vegetation, and rocks. Using step 1\nof the direct Potts segmentation method as described in\nthe previous section (with Q = 16 and st = 7.5), sky and\nrock are distinguished from water and vegetation according to pixel intensities. The sky and rock are represented\nas lighter shades, while water and vegetation are depicted\nas darker shades of gray in Figs. 5b and 5c. To further\nseparate the shades of gray, step 2 in the previous section\neffectively identifies regions of different texture (smooth\nor grainy). The full (steps one and two) direct Potts segmentation result is shown in Fig. 5b. After filtering by\nusing the despeckle algorithm, we see in Fig. 5c that the\nsky (white, bright/smooth texture) is distinguished from\nthe rock regions (light gray, bright/grainy), and water\n(dark gray, dark/smooth) is distinguished from the vegetation (black, dark/grainy). Segmenting the image by intensity using the four-level histogram produces the image\nin Fig. 5d. The histogram approach does not distinguish\nsky from rock (both are light gray) and does comparatively less well in distinguishing vegetation (lower left of\nimage) from the background. A comparison of Figs. 5c\nand 5d underscores the importance of considering both\nintensity and texture in image segmentation.\nFigure 6a[30] shows an MRI image of a brain with a\ntumor in the upper left quadrant. The segmented image\nusing the direct Potts segmentation method with Q = 64\nand st = 31.5 is shown in Fig. 6b. After filtering, we obtain the the image in Fig. 6c. Here, the white regions may\nbe interpreted as possible tumorous tissue, light gray corresponds to matter at the periphery of the tumor, dark\ngray represents cerebrum, and black is other brain matter. Automated screening for tumors may be performed\nby finding white regions of significant size. Although,\nthe four-level histogram method (Fig. 6d) also identifies\na similar tumor region, the cerebrum is not distinguished\nfrom other brain matter. The affect of the chosen value\nfor Q is demonstrated in Fig. 7. Larger values of Q result in more of the image being categorized as textured\n(represented as light and dark gray). Finally, acoustic\nseafloor images may be analyzed in real-time with the\ndirect Potts segmentation method as demonstrated in\nFig. 8. Here sand ripples are identified (in green) as a\ngrainy texture and is separated from the remainder of\nthe image.

The Potts model\nis applied to the grayscale image itself rather than its\nmore common application to the segmented image.

A tumor\nis seen as the bright spot in the upper left region of the MRI.\nThis image is from the Iowa Neuroradiology Library. Image at upper right (b) is the direct Potts segmentation with\nQ = 64, st = 31.5. Lower left (c) is the direct Potts segmentation that has been despeckled. The clearly visible white\nsegment identifies the tumor. A tumor is clearly visible as\nthe bright spot in the upper left region. The periphery of the\ntumor is shown in light gray, while cerebrum is represented\nas dark gray. Other brain matter is shown in black. For comparison, lower right (d) is the despeckled four-level histogram\nsegmentation, which identifies the tumor region, but cannot\ndistinguish cerebrum from other brain matter.\n\near time instead of the exponential or power-law time\nrequired with conventional Potts segmentation methods.\nThis increase in computational efficiency is vital for realtime, high data volume, and high resolution applications. The method is analogous to minimizing the total\nenergy in a two-dimensional magnetic spin glass where\nthe energy is calculated according to four Potts models. Each of the four Potts models corresponds to a distinct type of magnetism, so the direct Potts segmentation method effectively distinguishes regions in the spin\nglass that most closely adhere to the properties of four\nclasses of magnetism, namely ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and diamagnetism.

Results are shown for Q = 16 (a), Q = 32 (b), and Q = 128.\nIn each case, the intensity threshold is st = (Q \u2212 1)/2. For\nhigher values of Q, more of the image is categorized as textured (light and dark gray).\n\ntal image segmentation, pixel intensities are substituted\nfor the magnetic spins in the spin glass. The astute reader\nwill note that no mention has been made of the physical\nbasis for the coupling constants J\u03b1 for the regions in the\nsegmented image. The origins of the image pixels' couplings may, in fact, be complicated or unknown. Branching of plants give a textured appearance in Fig. 5a, while\nthe distribution of blood vessels and other brain material\nlikely gives the textured appearance to Fig. 6a. Underwater sand ripples may arise from the fluid dynamics and\nsaltation [26, 27] at the seafloor. The direct Potts segmentation has the advantages of being unsupervised (no\ntraining sets needed), very efficient (linear-time, only a\nfew operation per pixel), and effective for texture identification. For many image segmentation applications in\nwhich texture is important, this direct Potts method may\nbe expected to produce better results than other lineartime methods.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFIG. 8: Acoustic image of the seafloor formed using a sidescan\nsonar system, which creates an image going out on either side\nvia an acoustic time series.
