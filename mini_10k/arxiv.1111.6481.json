The work is expected, among other possible applications, to allow for the metric representation of Lorentzian spin foam models in\nthe context of quantum gravity.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, in the context of 3d quantum gravity models, the so-called group Fourier transform\nwas introduced [1, 2], which provides a unitary map from functions on SO(3) to functions on a\ndual non-commutative space, analogous to the usual Fourier transform for functions on Rd . It was\nfurther generalized to the case of SU (2) in [3, 4] in two different ways. (See also [5, 6].) In [7] the\ntransform was used to formulate a non-commutative metric representation for Loop Quantum Gravity\nquantum states, dual to the usual group representation, and similarly in [8] a metric formulation\nof the Boulatov model for 3d Euclidean quantum gravity was derived using the transform. The\nmetric variables obtained through the transform clarify the geometric content of these models, and\nin [9] this proved to be advantageous in writing down the action of diffeomorphisms for the Boulatov\nmodel. Furthermore, in [10] the transform was applied to write down a first order phase space path\nintegral for quantum mechanics on SO(3), which was checked to agree with the well-established\nresults obtained by more conventional methods. Here, we generalize the formalism of group Fourier\ntransform to an arbitrary finite dimensional Lie group G, and give a dual representation of quantum\nmechanics on G in terms of non-commutative variables. We further derive the first order phase space\npath integral for a quantum system on G.\nII.\n\nGROUP FOURIER TRANSFORM\n\nLet G be a finite dimensional Lie group and g\u2217 the dual of the Lie algebra g of G. The cotangent\nbundle T \u2217 G of G is globally trivial, T \u2217 G = G \u00d7 g\u2217 , due to the automorphisms of G given by the group\nmultiplication. The general idea behind the group Fourier transform [1\u20134, 10] is the following.\nDefinition 1. The non-commutative plane wave is a function E : T \u2217 G = G \u00d7 g\u2217 \u2192 C, (g, X) 7\u2192\nEg (X), from the cotangent bundle T \u2217 G of G to C in terms of which the delta distribution \u03b4e at the\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: matti.raasakka@aei.mpg.de\n\n\f2\nidentity e \u2208 G can be decomposed as\n\u03b4e (g) =\n\nZ\n\ng\u2217\n\ndX\nEg (X) ,\n(2\u03c0)d\n\n(1)\n\nwhere dX is the Lebesgue measure on g\u2217 and d := dim G.\nNow, we want to introduce a \u22c6-product associated to the non-commutative plane wave E, which\nreflects the group structure. In general, it is a deformation of the usual point-wise product of functions\non g\u2217 . This will later give rise to the non-commutative structure of the dual space of functions on\ng\u2217 by linearity.\nDefinition 2. The \u22c6-product associated to E for functions on g\u2217 is such that\nEg (X) \u22c6 Eh (X) = Egh (X) .\n\n(2)\n\nProposition 1. The \u22c6-product is associative, but not commutative, in general. The constant unit\nfunction 1 is the unity with respect to the \u22c6-product, if Ee (X) = 1.\nProof. The associativity and commutativity properties of the \u22c6-product follow directly from the\ngroup structure, which the \u22c6-product reflects. Moreover,\n1 \u22c6 Eg (X) = Ee (X) \u22c6 Eg (X) = Eeg (X) = Eg (X) ,\n\n(3)\n\nand similarly for Eg (X) \u22c6 1 = Eg (X).\nFrom hereon we will assume that Ee (X) = 1.\nDefinition 3. The group Fourier transform \u03c6\u0303 \u2208 L2\u22c6 (g\u2217 , dX) of a function \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (G, dg) is\nZ\ndg Eg\u22121 (X)\u03c6(g) ,\n\u03c6\u0303(X) :=\n\n(4)\n\nG\n\nwhere dg denotes the left-invariant Haar measure on G, and the \u22c6-product is extended to L2\u22c6 (g\u2217 , dX)\nby linearity.\nHere, the function space L2\u22c6 (g\u2217 , dX) is defined as the image of L2 (G, dg) under the transform,\nequipped with the norm\nZ\ndX\n\u2032\nh\u03c6\u0303|\u03c6\u0303 i :=\n\u03c6\u0303(X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303\u2032 (X) .\n(5)\nd\n(2\u03c0)\n\u2217\ng\nProposition 2. The inverse transform is obtained as\nZ\ndX\n\u03c6(g) =\nEg (X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303(X) .\nd\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\n\n(6)\n\nProof. We have\nZ\nZ\ndX\ndX\ndh\nEg (X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303(X) =\nEg (X) \u22c6 Eh\u22121 (X)\u03c6(h)\nd\nd\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\nG\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\nZ\nZ\nZ\ndX\ndh \u03b4g (h)\u03c6(h) = \u03c6(g) ,\nEgh\u22121 (X)\u03c6(h) =\ndh\n=\nd\nG\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\nG\nZ\n\nwhere we used the properties (1) and (2).\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nProposition 3.

It follows that Eg (X) = exp(iZ(g) * X).\nIn fact, if G contains compact subgroups, we have to exclude a set of measure zero, the non-unital\ninvolutive elements, i.e., g \u2208 G such that g\u22121 = g, g 6= e, from the range of the coordinates Z i on G\ndue to Z i (g\u22121 ) = \u2212Z i (g) following from the requirement of unitarity for the transform. However, this\nis fine, since we only need (2) to be well-defined under integration for the group Fourier transform.\nDenote H := G\\{g \u2208 G | g\u22121 = g, g 6= e}. Then we may write for \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (G, dg)\nZ\nZ\ndg Eg\u22121 (X)\u03c6(g)\ndg Eg\u22121 (X)\u03c6(g) =\n\u03c6\u0303(X) \u2261\nH\nZG\n\u03c9(Z)dZ eiZ(g)*X \u03c6\u0302(Z) ,\n(12)\n=\nR\n\nwhere R \u2286 Rdim G is the range of the coordinates (Z i ) on H, \u03c9(Z)dZ is the left-invariant Haar\nmeasure in terms of the Lebesgue measure dZ on R, and \u03c6\u0302 := \u03c6 \u25e6 Z \u22121 , Z \u22121 : R \u2192 H being the\ninverse of the coordinates (Z i ) : H \u2192 R \u2286 Rdim G .\nThe linearity properties also imply that Eg (X) is the generating function for polynomials in the\ncoordinates. In particular,\n(\u2212i)n Li1 Li2 * * * Lin Ee (X) = (\u2212i)n Li1 Ee (X) \u22c6 Li2 Ee (X) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 Lin Ee (X)\n= Xi1 \u22c6 Xi2 \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 Xin ,\n1\n\n(13)\n\nThe spinorial non-commutative plane waves for the group Fourier transform on SU (2) used in [4] do not satisfy the\nsecond one of these properties, and therefore it seems not possible in that case to find a simple differential group\nelement operator in the dual representation as below.\n\n\f4\nand so we have [Xi , Xj ]\u22c6 := Xi \u22c6 Xj \u2212 Xj \u22c6 Xi = \u2212icij k Xk , where cij k are the structure constants of\ng. Accordingly, the non-commutative \u22c6-product structure reflects the structure of the Lie algebra of\nG.\nProposition 4. Let \u03c6\u0303, \u03c6\u0303\u2032 \u2208 L2\u22c6 (g\u2217 , dX), and \u03c9(Z)dZ be the Haar measure dg on H \u2286 G in terms of\nthe Lebesgue measure dZ on R \u2286 Rdim G .

If Z(hgh\u22121 ) * X = Z(g) * Adh X, we have\nEg (X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303(X) \u22c6 Eg\u22121 (X) = \u03c6\u0303(Adg X) .\n\n(16)\n\nProof.

Also, using this property, it is easy to show\nthat\nZ\nZ\ndX\ndX\n\u03c6\u03031 (X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u03032 (X) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303n (X) =\n\u03c6\u03032 (X) \u22c6 * * * \u22c6 \u03c6\u0303n (X) \u22c6 \u03c6\u03031 (X) ,\n(18)\nd\nd\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\ng\u2217 (2\u03c0)\ni.e., an integral over g\u2217 is invariant under a cyclic permutation of the \u22c6-product factors of its integrand.\nThe choice for the explicit form of the non-commutative plane waves Eg (X) is not completely\nobvious. It dictates the explicit form of the \u22c6-product, and is thus connected to the issue of operator\nordering in the quantization map, which the \u22c6-product reflects from the deformation quantization\npoint of view [11]. The canonical choice for coordinate functions Z i on the identity component of\nG, when the exponential map is surjective, is obtained from the inverse of the exponential map\nexp : g \u2243 Rd \u2192 G, Z 7\u2192 exp Z, for a portion of g containing the origin, where the exponential\nmap is one-to-one. With this choice we have the natural inner product * : g \u00d7 g\u2217 \u2192 R to use for\nthe plane waves Eg (X) = exp(iZ(g) * X).2 These coordinates satisfy all the above requirements.\nHowever, mainly other choices for the coordinates have been considered in the literature in the cases\nof the groups SO(3) and SU (2) [1\u20134, 7\u201310, 12]. In particular, [1, 2, 8, 10] use the coordinates\nZ i (g) = \u2212 2i tr(g\u03c3 i ) for SO(3), where the trace is taken in the fundamental spin- 12 -representation and\n2\n\nIn the case of several components or non-compact Lie groups for which the exponential map is not surjective, we\nmay generalize to several coordinate patches as in [3], using coordinates Zh (g) \u2208 g such that g \u2261 heZh (g) for different\norigins h \u2208 G for the coordinate patches.\n\n\f5\n\u03c3 i are the Pauli matrices. They satisfy all the above assumptions for Z i . These coordinates may\nbe more convenient from the calculational point of view, but are not generalizable to arbitrary Lie\ngroups.\nLet us summarize the properties of the non-commutative plane wave, i.e., the function E : T \u2217 G \u2192\nC we will use in the following. In short, we assume\nEg (X) \u2261 exp(iZ(g) * X) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere Z i (g) are coordinates on G\\{g \u2208 G | g \u22121 = g, g 6= e} such that\n1. Z i (g\u22121 ) = \u2212Z i (g)\n2. Li Z j (e) = \u03b4ij\n3. Z(hgh\u22121 ) * X = Z(g) * Adh X.\nWith these assumptions the above construction for the group Fourier transform applies.\nIII.\n\nDUAL REPRESENTATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ON G\n\nTo describe a quantum system with G as its configuration space, we start as usual with the Hilbert\nspace L2 (G, dg) of wave functions on G. Employing the Dirac notation, a basis {|gi | g \u2208 G} is given\nby delta distributions hh|gi := \u03b4g (h). We may understand |gi as eigenstates of the group element\noperator \u011d in the abstract sense \u03c6(\u011d)|gi \u2261 \u03c6(g)|gi, where \u03c6 is a function on G. In particular, we\ndenote \u1e90 i := Z i (\u011d). We may define operators X\u0302i := \u2212iLi , which are conjugate to \u1e90 i in the sense of\n[X\u0302i , \u1e90 j ]|ei = \u2212i\u03b4ij |ei, i.e., they satisfy the canonical commutation relations at the unit element (but\nreceive non-linear corrections away from the unity).3 These commutators reproduce the canonical\nPoisson algebra of the cotangent bundle4 T \u2217 G \u2243 G \u00d7 g\u2217 of G, given by the Poisson bracket\nj\ni\ni\ni\nF )(\u2202X\nG) ,\n{F, G}P B = (\u2202X\nF )(Li G) \u2212 (\u2202X\nG)(Li F ) + cij k Xk (\u2202X\n\n(20)\n\n\\\nin the appropriate way, namely, {F,\nG}P B = i[F\u0302 , \u011c] for the canonical operators.\nNow, we may consider another set of state vectors {|Xi | X \u2208 g\u2217 }, defined via hg|Xi := Eg (X).\nThese states also form a basis of the Hilbert space in the sense of the \u22c6-product,\nZ\ndX\n|Xi \u22c6 hX| \u2261 1\u0302 ,\nhY |Xi \u2261 \u03b4\u22c6 (X \u2212 Y ) and\n(21)\nd\n(2\u03c0)\ng\u2217\nand therefore we obtain a dual representation of the quantum system in terms of X \u2208 g\u2217 :\nZ\ndg hX|gihg|\u03c6i .\nhX|\u03c6i =\n\n(22)\n\nG\n\nThe canonical operators are given in this basis by\ni\n\u1e90 i |Xi = \u2212i\u2202X\n|Xi\n\nand X\u0302i |Xi = |Xi \u22c6 Xi .\n\n(23)\n\n\u0001\ni ) |Xi, where g(Z i ) is the inverse of the coordinates (Z i (g)).5\nThen, we also have \u03c6(\u011d)|Xi = \u03c6 g(\u2212i\u2202X\n3\n4\n5\n\nWe have set ~ = 1.\nThe classical Poisson algebra follows unambiguously from the canonical symplectic structure of T \u2217 G.\nHere we must again note that, strictly speaking, (Z i (g)) is not invertible for a set of measure zero in G. However,\napart from the abstract Dirac notation, we will only need to assume these relations to be defined under integration\nover G, since this is how the dual representation is defined to begin with.\n\n\f6\nIV.\n\nPHASE SPACE PATH INTEGRAL\n\nNow, taking advantage of the dual representation for the Hilbert space introduced in the previous\nsection, we may write down the first order phase space path integral for a quantum system with G as\nthe configuration space. As usual, we have a Hamiltonian operator \u0124 generating the time-evolution\nof the system. Then, the propagator for the quantum system in G-basis reads\n\u2032\n\nhg\u2032 , t\u2032 |g, ti := hg \u2032 |e\u2212i(t \u2212t)\u0124 |gi .\n\n(24)\n\nIntroducing time-splitting (t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2261 \u01ebN and inserting resolutions of identity\nR dX\n1\u0302 \u2261 g\u2217 (2\u03c0)\nd |Xi \u22c6 hX| for each timestep yields\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nhg , t |g, ti =\n\n\"N \u22121 Z\nY\nk=1\n\ndgk\n\nG\n\n# \"N \u22121 Z\nY\nk=0\n\ng\u2217\n\ndXk\n(2\u03c0)d\n\n1\u0302 \u2261\n\nR\n\nG\n\ndg |gihg| and\n\n# \"N \u22121\n#\nY\n\u2212i\u01eb\u0124\nhgk+1 |Xk i \u22c6 hXk |e\n|gk i .\n\n(25)\n\nk=0\n\nTo obtain the path integral, we take the limits \u01eb \u2192 0, N \u2192 \u221e, while \u01ebN = (t\u2032 \u2212 t). For the path\nintegral to satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, only the linear order in \u01eb must be taken into account\n[13], and we may approximate\n\u0001\nhXk |e\u2212i\u01eb\u0124 |gk i \u2248 1 \u2212 i\u01ebH\u22c6 (gk , Xk ) \u22c6 hXk |gk i \u2248 e\u2212i\u01ebH\u22c6 (gk ,Xk ) \u22c6 hXk |gk i ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere hg|\u0124|Xi =: hg|Xi \u22c6 H\u22c6 (g, X). Further, using (14) and (18), we arrive at the discrete timestep\nexpression for the path integral\n#\n# \"N \u22121 Z\n\"N \u22121 Z\nY\nY\ndXk\n\u2032 \u2032\ndgk\nhg , t |g, ti = lim\nd\n\u01eb\u21920\n\u2217 (2\u03c0)\nk=0 g\nN \u2192\u221e k=1 G\n( N \u22121 \u0012\n\u0013)\nX\n1\n\u22121\n,\n(27)\nZ(gk gk+1 ) * Xk \u2212 Hq (gk , Xk )\n\u00d7 exp i\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\nk=0\n\ni )H (g, X) is the quantum corrected Hamiltonian for the system.

In [10] the stationary\nphase approximation to (28) was studied for SO(3) with coordinates Z i (g) = \u2212(i/2)tr(g\u03c3 i ) and\nfound to yield the correct classical equations of motion. Also, it was shown that for the case of a\nfree particle on SO(3) the quantum corrections agree with the well-established results [11, 13, 14]\nobtained by more conventional methods.\n\n\f7\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION & COMMENTS\n\nWe have formulated a notion of group Fourier transform for a finite dimensional Lie group G,\nand used it to write down the phase space path integral for a quantum system on G. The main\nadvantages of the approach to quantum systems on Lie groups presented here are:\n1. The non-commutative dual variables are analogous to the classical commutative ones, so their\nphysical meaning is intuitive.\n2. There is no need to resort to the representation theory of Lie groups and special functions,\nwhich often are rather involved.\nThe price to pay for these simplifications is, of course, the non-commutativity of the dual space,\nand depending on the system in case one may prefer one approach over the other. However, the\nclear physical interpretation of the non-commutative dual variables has already proven itself useful\nin the case of quantum gravity models in shedding light on their geometrical content [7\u20139, 12]. The\ngeneralization of the group Fourier transform to an arbitrary Lie group removes the restriction of\nthese considerations to the case of products of SO(3) or SU (2). In particular, from the point of view\nof quantum gravity, the possibility to formulate the metric representation for 4d quantum gravity\nmodels using the transform for the Lorentz group is important. Considering the second point, also\nthe study of the semi-classical limit of the quantum system is greatly facilitated by not having to\ndeal with special functions [10], and therefore we expect non-commutative methods to be useful also\nin studying the asymptotics of quantum gravity models.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author wishes to thank Daniele Oriti for his encouragement to write this paper, and Carlos\nGuedes for many useful discussions on the subject.\n\n[1] Freidel L., Livine E., Class.
