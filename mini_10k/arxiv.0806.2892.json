However, microscopic calculations for a large spin with uniaxial anisotropy, coupled to the lattice via\nthe simplest generic mechanism, show that the results of the conventional theory are not reproduced in the limit S \u2192 \u221e. In particular, the prefactor \u03930 in the Arrhenius escape rate over\nthe barrier \u0393 = \u03930 exp [\u2212\u2206U/ (kB T )] has an anomalously large sensitivity to symmetry-breaking\ninteractions such as transverse field.\n\nFerromagnetic particles of a sufficiently small size (e.g.,\nmagnetic nanoparticles) are in a single-domain magnetic\nstate, atomic spins being kept collinear by a strong exchange interaction. The resulting giant spin of a magnetic particle shows a bistability in the case of uniaxial\nanisotropy that creates two energy minima and a barrier\nbetween them [1, 2]. At thermal equilibrium, there is a\ndistribution over directions of particles' spins similar to\nthat of paramagnets. Since total spins of magnetic particles are very large, this kind of paramagnetism is called\n\"superparamagnetism\".\n\ndirectly as a stochastic differential equation [11, 12], also\nfor the model with a variable spin length near the Curie\ntemperature [13]. For a model of many classical atomic\nspins forming a nanoparticle, direct solution of a system\nof Landau-Lifshitz-Langevin (LLL) equations is the only\nworking numerical method [14].\n\nWith increasing the size of a magnetic particle, noncollinearities due to the surface anisotropy proliferate and\nthe single-domain state is gradually destroyed. Small\nnoncollinearities result in an additional cubic anisotropy\nfor particle's global magnetization [15\u201317] that is secondN\u00e9el suggested a model of relaxation of ensembles of order in the surface-anisotropy constant and scales as the\nmagnetic particles in which spins are hopping between the particle's volume. Another interesting effect is relaxation\ntwo energy minima [3]. Modern approach to superpara- via internal spin waves [18, 19] that should add up with\nmagnetic dynamics is based on the Landau-Lifshitz equa- the relaxation due to the environment.\ntion [4] for classical spins of fixed length augmented by the\nExperimentally, only recent successes in fabrication of\nstochastic Langevin field simulating the environment [5] nanoparticles with well-controlled parameters allowed to\nthat is equivalent to the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) obtain the famous Stoner-Wohlfarth astroid and check\nfor classical spins.

However, this model\np-1\n\n\fD. A. Garanin\ncontradicts the time-reversal symmetry. Deformations of\nthe lattice due to thermal fluctuations cannot produce\nany fluctuating effective magnetic field (i.e., terms in the\nHamiltonian linear in spin components). It rather produces a fluctuating anisotropy, i.e., stochastic terms even\nin components of the spin S. The corresponding analysis has been done in Ref. [33] where it was shown how\nthe symmetry and strength of the relaxation term in\nthe Landau-Lifshitz equation follows from those of the\nstochastic terms. However, this model for classical spins\nwas never used because it can include too many difficultto-define coupling and damping constants.\nOn the other hand, all microscopic quantum-mechanical\nmodels of spin-lattice relaxation employ spin-lattice couplings that do not violate basic symmetries. Until recently, however, these calculations suffered from too many\nunknown coupling constants that allowed only order-ofmagnitude estimations. Discovery of the universal mechanism of spin relaxation via distortionless rotation of the\ncrystal field by transverse phonons [34,35] changed the situation. Within this mechanism, spin-lattice coupling can\nbe expressed through the parameters of the crystal field\nthat can be easily measured. Implementing this mechanism in the stochastic formalism for classical spins of\nRef. [33] would allow to rewrite the theory of superparamagnetism in a more satisfactory form.\nThe less ambitious aim of this Letter is, however, just\nto demonstrate that relaxation of large spins of magnetic\nparticles cannot be described by the conventional classical approach. The point is that the most important\nquantum-mechanical relaxation processes such as emission/absorption of phonons are sensitive to the energy\nlevels of the spin. Since in the existing LLL formalism\nthe information of the energy levels is lost, there is no\nconnection to the underlying quantum mechanics and the\nensuing results are questionable.\nOne can argue that giant spins of magnetic particles,\nS \u226b 1, are classical to a high degree of precision. This is\nnot true, however, since even the relaxation in the bulk is\ngoverned by quantum mechanics. Of course, equilibrium\nproperties of superparamagnets are classical since one has\nthe Langevin function instead of the Brillouin function\nfor the field-dependent magnetization. The relaxation remains non-classical, however, whatever large is the particle. Indeed, quantum effects in magnetic particles have\nbeen recently observed and discussed in Ref. [36].\nTo understand the importance of quantum effects in\nmagnetic particles, one has to realize the difference between the classical-spin limit and the large-spin limit. The\nclassical-spin limit is a theoretical trick to simplify calculations by eliminating quantum effects. The large-spin limit,\nto the contrary, is the real situation.\nFor instance, for a system of N atomic spins s with\nthe easy-axis Hamiltonian \u0124 = \u2212ds2z , held together by a\nstrong exchange, the total spin is S = N s \u226b 1. Within\nthe classical-spin limit, the effective classical Hamiltonian\nof the system would be H = \u2212DSz2 with D = d/N 2\n\nto preserve the energy barrier \u2206U = ds2 = DS 2 . With\nthe energy levels of the spin S given by \u03b5m = \u2212Dm2 ,\nthe transition frequency \u03c9S\u22121,S = \u03b5S\u22121 \u2212 \u03b5S between the\nground and first excited states of the effective spin becomes ~\u03c9S,S\u22121 = (2S \u2212 1) D \u223c\n= 2sd/N , disappearing in\nthe limit N \u2192 \u221e. Accordingly, the direct phonon processes die out for large N, so that the only relaxation\nprocesses due to phonons become the two-phonon Raman\nprocesses that become insensitive to the energy levels for\nsmall transition frequencies.\nIn the realistic large-spin limit, the transition frequency\n\u03c9S,S\u22121 is preserved, because this is the frequency of the\nsmall-amplitude spin precession in the anisotropy field.\nThus the effective anisotropy constant D scales according to ~\u03c9S,S\u22121 = (2S \u2212 1) D \u223c\n= 2SD = 2N sD = 2sd =\nconst, hence D = d/N. In this case the energy barrier is\n\u2206U = DS 2 = N ds2 \u221d N, the size of the particle, as it\nshould be. One can see that direct spin-phonon processes\nsurvive in the large-spin limit. This makes the situation\ncompletely different from the classical-spin limit, regarding the relaxation.\nOn the other hand, the transition frequencies between\nthe levels near the top of the barrier, m \u223c 1, are of order\n~\u03c9m,m\u22121 = (2m \u2212 1) D \u223c D \u221d 1/N and they vanish in\nthe large-spin limit. This means that direct phonon processes between the adjacent evergy levels, having the rate\n(1)\n2\n\u0393m.m\u22121 \u221d \u03c9m,m\u22121\nfor ~\u03c9m,m\u22121 \u226a kB T, die out near the\ntop of the barrier that becomes a bottleneck for the thermal activation process. In this region, diffusion of spin\npopulations over the stairway of adjacent levels is effectuated by much weaker Raman processes that leads to\nsmall escape prefactors \u03930 with essential temperature dependence [37].\nTransverse magnetic field H\u22a5 or transverse anisotropy\ncreate saddles in the potential landscape of the effective\nspin that strongly change dynamics of thermal activation.\nA \"phase diagram\" of different regimes, such as uniaxial,\nhigh-, intermediate-, and low-damping regimes, created\nby the transverse field, has been obtained in Ref. [38].\nEspecially in the low-damping (LD) case, transverse field\nresults in a strong increase of the escape rate \u0393. As can\nbe seen from the comparison of the LD and HD cases in\nFig. 3 of Ref. [38], the main effect is the increase of the\nprefactor \u03930 , while lowering the barrier \u2206U (equal in the\nLD and HD cases) plays a secondary role.\nFor a quantum large spin, the effect of transverse field\nH\u22a5 should be even greater, since for H\u22a5 = 0 the prefactor \u03930 is anomalously small. For H\u22a5 6= 0, the states\n|mi are no longer eigenvalues of the spin Hamiltonian H,\nand spin hopping is no longer restricted to ajacent levels.\nThus transverse field should resolve the bottleneck near\nthe top of the barrier, leading to a huge increase of the\nescape prefactor \u03930 . The aim of the present work is to describe this effect by solving the density matrix equation\n(DME) that is a quantum counterpart of the FPE. The\nuniversal mechanism of spin-lattice relaxation [34, 35] has\nbeen recently incorporated into the DME [39]. Here it\n\np-2\n\n\fAre superparamagnetic spins classical?\ncoefficients and it is entirely represented by the crystal\nfield \u0124A . To describe the two-phonon (Raman) processes,\none has to expand \u0124s\u2212ph up to the second order in \u03b4\u03c6\n[39, 40]. Relaxation rates due to Raman processes are\ngenerally much smaller than those due to the direct processes since they are the next order in the spin-phonon\ninteraction. However, the rates of direct processes can\nbe small for special reasons, then Raman processes become important. Here it happens indeed near the top of\nthe barrier in zero transverse field, where the transition\nfrequencies between adjacent levels become small. This\nsituation has been studied in detail in Ref. [37], however.\n\u0124S = \u0124A + \u0124Z ,\n(1) So we will neglect Raman proceses here and concentrate\non the effect of the transverse field that change transition\nwhere \u0124A is the crystal-field (anisotropy) Hamitonian and frequencies and drastically increase the escape rate.\n\u0124Z is the Zeeman Hamiltonian,\nWe use the canonical quantization of the lattice displacement\nu that yields\n2\n\u0124Z = gmB (Hz Sz + Hx Sx ) .\n(2)\n\u0124A = \u2212DSz ,\nr\n\u0011\n~ X [ik \u00d7 ek\u03bb ] eik*r \u0010\n1\nThe classical energy barrier \u2206U has particular forms\nak\u03bb + a\u2020\u2212k\u03bb .

Indeed, in the natural basis the spin-phonon\ntransition rate between two adacent levels is proportional\n2\nto l\u0304m,m\u00b11\n[42], where l\u0304m,m\u00b11 \u2261 lm,m\u00b11 (2m \u00b1 1) and\np\nS(S + 1) \u2212 m(m \u00b1 1). In \u0393S,S\u22121 the factor\nlm,m\u00b11 =\n2\nl\u0304m,m\u00b11\nyields S while for a typical value of m in the interval \u2212S \u2264 m \u2264 S it yields S 2 . This is the origin of an\nadditional S in Eq. (13).\nIn the comparizon between different values of S shown\nin Fig. 2 the product SD is kept constant, as it should\nbe for the effective anisotropy of magnetic particles. In\nnumerical calculations D/kB = 6.5/S K is used and the\ntemperature kB T = SD = const. Fig. 2 (a) shows that\ncurves \u03930 /\u0393\u0303 scale for large S in a wide range of hx , that\nmeans \u03930 \u221d S 2 . Calculations use custom-precision matrix\nalgebra within Wolfram Mathematica and become slow for\nspins as large as S = 80. One can see that in the largespin limit \u03930 becomes small if hx \u2192 0 and hx \u2192 1. In\nparticular, for hx \u2192 0 the apparent behavior is \u03930 \u221d h2x .\nThe behavior of \u03930 at small transverse fields is elucidated in Fig. 2 (b). Here one has to use a slightly different normalization of \u03930 to make curves collapse in a\nwide range of hx , yielding \u03930 \u221d S 3/2 h2x . In the uniaxial\nlimit hx \u2192 0 the curves for different S diverge. Here the\nescape prefactor is given by the transition rate between\nthe ajacent levels near the top of the barrier \u0393m,m\u00b11 with\nm \u2243 1. Using Eq. (A9) of Ref. [35] for \u0393m,m\u00b11 [multiplied\nby n\u03c9m,m\u00b11 \u223c\n= kB T /(~\u03c9m,m\u00b11) to account for a nonzero\ntemperature], one obtains \u03930 \u221d S \u22122 . This is the top-ofthe-barrier bottleneck mentioned in the introduction. In\nthe representation of Fig. 2 (b) one has \u03930 /S 3/2 \u221d S \u22127/2 .\nOne can see that doubling S results in the drop by a factor\n27/2 \u2243 11 in the asymptotic hx \u2192 0 values in Fig. 2 (b).\nThe anomalously small rate in the uniaxial limit above\nis in part due to the factor 2m\u00b11 discussed below Eq. (13).\nIn the zero-bias case the top of the barrier corresponds to\nm \u223c 1 that results in additional smallness. In the case of\na strong enough bias one has 2m \u00b1 1 \u223c S near the top\nof the barrier, so that the anomalously small escape rate\nsolely results from small \u03c9m,m\u00b11 . The results of numerical\ncalculations for the bias hx \u2248 0.5, adjusted to the middle\nbetween two tunneling resonances are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe curves for \u03930 in a broad range of hx in Fig. 3 (a) look\ncomplicated for moderate S but still collapse for large S.\nThe decrease of \u03930 at hx \u2192 0 is indeed weaker than in the\nunbiased case above. The results at small hx in Fig. 3 (b)\nshow a dependence \u03930 \u221d S 3/2 h0.85\nx , where the exponent\n0.85 cannot be easily explained. For hx = 0 Eq. (A9)\nof Ref. [35] yields \u03930 \u221d S 0 in the biased case, also much\nsmaller than \u03930 \u221d S 2 for hx \u223c 1.\nIt should be noted that the secular approximation leading to Eq. (10) relies on the smallness of the relaxation\nterms in the DME in comparison to the dissipationless\nterms for the nondiagonal elements of the density matrix [39]. Then slow diagonal elements \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 = n\u03b1 dynamically decouple from the fast nondiagonal terms \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 .

In the LD limit the energy of the particle or spin is nearly conserved, so that the\nfast motion over constant-energy trajectories averages out\nand what is left is the slow energy diffusion (see, e.g., Eqs.\n(15) and (16) of Ref. [38]). Similarly, Eq. (10) describe a\nslow hopping over the quantum energy levels of the spin.\nOne can ask whether the richness of damping regimes\nthat exist in the classical-spin model [38] can be realized\nfor a realistic large quantum spin of a magnetic particle.\nFor instance, the intermediate-to-large damping (IHD)\ncase requires that the gyroscopic and relaxation terms in\nthe FPE be comparable. This means that the dissipationless and relaxation terms in the DME be comparable as\nwell. Of course, for S \u226b 1 nondiagonal elements \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 close\nto diagonal become slow as \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 . However, the relaxation\n2\nrate \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 between the states \u03b1 and \u03b2 scales as \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2\nfor |\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 | \u226a T and decreases faster than \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 in the quasiclassical limit S \u226b 1.\nWhat can change the situation is Raman processes that\nbecome independent of \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 for small \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 . Incorporating\nRaman processes requires generalization of the results of\nRef. [37] for a nonzero transverse field that is a nontrivial\ntask. As Raman processes are much weaker than direct\nprocesses, crossover to a Raman-dominated behavior requires very large S. Although a general nonsecular DME\n\np-5\n\n\fD. A. Garanin\ncan be solved as described in Ref. [39], calculations are\nmuch slower than those of Eq. (10) and become prohibitive\nfor the required very large S. For this reason, Raman processes cannot be adequately treated within this Letter and\nshould be considered elsewhere.\nIn all cases, even with account of Raman processes,\nthere should be a bottleneck for spin diffusion near the\ntop of the barrier in the case of nearly uniaxial magnetic\nparticles. Transverse magnetic field gradually resolves the\nbottleneck and leads to a huge increase of the escape-rate\nprefactor \u03930 that is more important than the barrier lowering. This is the main finding of this work. Thermal\nactivation rates of nearly-uniaxial magnetic particles are\nvery sensitive to any deviations from the axial magnetic\nsymmetry, e.g., due to surface anisotropy [15\u201317]. Robust\nresults require a strong enough transverse field.\nWhether for large spins the classical stochastic approach could be modified to embrace the spacing between\nquantum-mechanical levels that has been shown to be important, remains an open question.\nThis work has been supported by the Cottrell College\nScience Award of the Research Corporation.\nReferences\n[1] Stoner E.
