We determine the rational integers x, y, z such that x3 + y 9 = z 2\nand gcd(x, y, z) = 1. First we determine a finite set of curves of genus 10\nsuch that any primitive solution to x3 + y 9 = z 2 corresponds to a rational\npoint on one of those curves. We observe that each of these genus 10 curves\ncovers an elliptic curve over some extension of Q. We use this cover to apply\na Chabauty-like method to an embedding of the curve in the Weil restriction\nof the elliptic curve. This enables us to find all rational points and therefore\ndeduce the primitive solutions to the original equation.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this article, we consider a special instance of the equation Axr + By s = Cz t .\nOne of the most important results for this equation is a theorem by Darmon and\nGranville ([7]), which for fixed, nonzero A, B, C and fixed r, s, t satisfying 1/r +\n1/s + 1/t < 1, relates primitive solutions x, y, z (solutions with x, y, z \u2208 Z and\ngcd(x, y, z) = 1) to rational points on finitely many algebraic curves of general\ntype. It follows by Faltings' theorem that only finitely many primitive solutions\nexist. Unfortunately, their proof does not provide a recipe to produce the relevant\ncurves.\nAs Tijdeman shows in [12], the ABC-conjecture implies that if one leaves A, B, C\nfixed, but allows r, s, t to vary subject to 1/r + 1/s + 1/t < 1, then the number for\nprimitive solutions to Axr + By s = Cz t is still finite.\nThe case A = B = C = 1 has received most attention. An extensive computer\nsearch performed by Beukers and Zagier (see [1]) showed there are some surprisingly\nlarge primitive solutions to xr + y s = z t for\n(1)\n\n{r, s, t} \u2208 {{2, 3, 7}, {2, 3, 8}, {2, 3, 9}, {2, 4, 5}}.\n\nWe call a solution trivial if one of x, y, z is equal to \u00b11. Note that this includes\n23 + 1r = 32 and, for primitive solutions, also any solution satisfying xyz = 0. With\nthis definition, the only equations xr + y s = z t with 1/r + 1/s + 1/t < 1 for which\nnon-trivial primitive solutions are known, are the ones satisfying (1).\nIt was noted by Tijdeman and Zagier that the known non-trivial primitive solutions of xr + y s = z t all have min(r, s, t) \u2264 2. They conjectured that for r, s, t \u2265 3\nonly trivial primitive solutions exist. The resolution of this conjecture has even\nattracted a monetary prize (see [9]).\nDate: October 31, 2003.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Because the equations satisfying\n(1) have known non-trivial primitive solutions, the question whether they have any\nothers appears natural. In his thesis ([4], [5] and [3]), the author resolved the cases\n{r, s, t} \u2208 {{2, 3, 8}, {2, 4, 5}}. Recently Poonen, Schaefer and Stoll have made\nexcellent progress on x2 + y 3 = z 7 . In this paper we deal with the one remaining\ncase:\nTheorem 1.1. The primitive solutions to the equation x3 + y 9 = z 2 are\n(x, y, z) \u2208 {(1, 1, 0), (0, 1, \u00b11), (1, 0, \u00b11), (2, 1, \u00b13), (\u22127, 2, \u00b113)}.\n2. Parametrising curves for x3 + y 9 = z 2\nWe note that the perfect 9th powers form a subset of the perfect cubes, so any\nprimitive solution (x, y, z) to x3 + y 9 = z 2 gives rise to a primitive solution (x, v, z)\nof x3 + v 3 = z 2 by putting v = y 3 . The solutions of the latter equation can be\nclassified by the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.1 (Mordell, [10, Chapter 25]). If x, v, z \u2208 Z with x3 + v 3 = z 2 and\ngcd(x, v, z) = 1, then there are s, t \u2208 Z[ 12 , 31 ] and (s, t) 6= (0, 0) mod p for any\nprime p \u2224 6, such one of the following holds.\nx or v\nv or x\nz\n\n= s4 + 6s2 t2 \u2212 3t4\n= \u2212s4 + 6s2 t2 + 3t4\n= \u00b16st(s4 + 3t4 )\n\nx or v =\nv or x =\nz =\nx or v =\nv or x =\nz =\n\n1 4\n2 2\n4\n4 (s + 6s t \u2212 3t )\n1\n4\n2 2\n4\n4 (\u2212s + 6s t + 3t )\n3\n4\n4\n\u00b1 4 st(s + 3t )\n3\n3\n\ns(s + 8t )\n4t(t3 \u2212 s3 )\n\u00b1s6 \u2212 20s3 t3 \u2212 8t6\n\nIt follows that in order to find all primitive solutions to x3 + y 9 = z 2 , it suffices\nto find all solutions y, s, t with y \u2208 Z and s, t \u2208 Z[ 12 , 13 ] with s, t not both divisible\nby any prime p not dividing 6, to the following equations:\n1:\n2:\n3:\n4:\n5:\n6:\n\ny3\ny3\ny3\ny3\ny3\ny3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ns4 + 6s2 t2 \u2212 3t4\n\u2212s4 + 6s2 t2 + 3t4\n1 4\n2 2\n4\n4 (s + 6s t \u2212 3t )\n1\n4\n2 2\n4\n4 (\u2212s + 6s t + 3t )\n3\n3\ns(s + 8t )\n4t(t3 \u2212 s3 ).\n\nThis leads us to a generalisation of the concept of primitive solution. Let S =\n{p1 , . . . , ps } be a finite set of primes. We write\nZS = Z[1/p1 , . . . , 1/ps ].\nA tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 ZS is called S-primitive if the ideal (x1 , . . . , xn )ZS equals ZS .\nEquivalently, it means that no prime outside S divides all xi . In order to determine\nthe primitive solutions of x3 + y 9 = z 2 , it suffices to determine the S-primitive\nsolutions to the equations above.\nObviously, if (s, t, y) is a solution to one of these equations, then so is an entire\nclass of weighted homogeneously equivalent solutions of the form (\u03bb3 s, \u03bb3 t, \u03bb4 y).\n\n\fTHE PRIMITIVE SOLUTIONS TO x3 + y 9 = z 2\n\n3\n\nFurthermore, a solution (s, t, y) to one of the equations 1 or 2 gives rise to a solution\n( 21 s, 12 t, 14 y) of equations 3 or 4 respectively. Note that the quantity (s : t) is\ninvariant under either transformation. Since a solution can be easily reconstructed\n(up to equivalence), it is sufficient to determine the values of s/t that can occur for\n{2, 3}-primitive solutions of the equations 1, 2, 5 and 6.\nFollowing [7], the equivalence classes under homogeneous equivalence of {2, 3}primitive solutions to each of these equations correspond to the rational points on\na finite collection of algebraic curves. We construct these curves explicitly (see also\n[5]). We introduce some notation.\nLet K be a number field and let S be a finite set of rational primes. For a prime\np of K we write p \u2224 S if vp (q) = 0 for all q \u2208 S. Following [11], for any rational\nprime p we define the following subgroup of K \u2217 /K \u2217p :\nK(p, S) = {a \u2208 K \u2217 : vp (a) \u2261 0 (mod r) for all primes p \u2224 S}/K \u2217p.\nThis is a finite group. We will identify it with a set of representatives in K \u2217 .\nLet f \u2208 K[x] be a square-free polynomial and let A := K[x]/(f ). The algebra A\nis isomorphic to a direct sum of number fields K1 , . . . , Kr and A\u2217 = K1\u2217 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Kr\u2217 .\nWe generalise the notation above by defining\nA(p, S) := K1 (p, S) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Kr (p, S) \u2282 A\u2217 /A\u2217p .\nWe identify the elements of this finite group with a set of representatives in A\u2217 .\nLemma 2.2. Let f (s, t) \u2208 Z[s, t] be a square-free homogeneous form of degree 4. Let\nS = {p prime : p | 3Disc(f )}. Solutions of y 3 = f (s, t) with y, s, t \u2208 Q, s, t integral\noutside S and (s, t) mod p 6= (0, 0) for any p \u2208\n/ S correspond, up to weighted\nprojective equivalence, to rational points on finitely many explicitly constructible\nsmooth projective curves of the form\nQ2,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 ) =\nQ3,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 ) =\n\n0\n0,\n\nindexed by \u03b4 \u2208 A(3, S) for some explicit semisimple algebra A. For each of these\ncurves, the ratio s/t can be explicitly expressed as a function\nQ0,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\ns\n=\u2212\n.\nt\nQ1,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\nProof. Using an SL2 (Z) transformation on s, t if necessary, we can assume that f\nis of degree 4 in s. We form the algebra A = Q[\u03b8] = Q[x]/f (x, 1). Let C be the\nleading coefficient of f (x, 1). Then we have f = CNA[s,t]/Q[s,t] (s \u2212 \u03b8t), so having a\nsolution would amount to the existence of y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 \u2208 Q and \u03b4 \u2208 A\u2217 such that\n(s \u2212 \u03b8t) =\ny\n\n=\n\n\u03b4(y0 + \u03b8y1 + \u03b82 y2 + \u03b83 y3 )3\nq\n3\nC NA/Q (\u03b4) NA[s,t]/Q[s,t] (y0 + \u03b8y1 + \u03b82 y2 + \u03b83 y3 ).\n\nIt follows immediately that C NA/Q (\u03b4) should be a perfect cube and that the value\nof \u03b4 is only relevant modulo cubes.\nThe fact that s, t are coprime implies that \u03b4 can be chosen from a finite set\nof representatives. From, for instance, [4, Lemma 2.2.1] it follows that if s, t are\nintegral and coprime outside of S, then \u03b4 \u2208 A(3, S).\n\n\f4\n\nNILS BRUIN\n\nGiven \u03b4 \u2208 A(3, S) with N (\u03b4) \u2208 Q\u22173 , there are unique cubic forms Q0,\u03b4 , . . . , Q3,\u03b4 \u2208\nQ[y0 , * * * , y3 ] such that\n\u03b4(y0 + \u03b8y1 + \u03b82 y2 + \u03b83 y3 )3 = Q0,\u03b4 + Q1,\u03b4 \u03b8 + Q2,\u03b4 \u03b82 + Q3,\u03b4 \u03b83\nSolving s, t from the equations above, we obtain\ns\nt\n0\n0\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nQ0,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\n\u2212Q1,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\nQ2,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\nQ3,\u03b4 (y0 , y1 , y2 , y3 )\n\nThe latter two equations define a smooth projective curve of genus 10 (see [4]) and\nthe first two equations show that s/t is a rational function on that curve.\n\u0003\n3. Rational points on the parametrising curves\nWe now proceed to apply this procedure to each of the equations mentioned\nabove and then determine the finite set of values that s/t attains for the {2, 3}primitive solutions. Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3 both require standard but elaborate and\ntedious computations. These are easily executed by a computer algebra system,\nbut are too bulky to reproduce completely on paper. We only give the basic data\nto check these computations. For the interested reader, we have made available a\ncomplete electronic transcript [2] of the computations in MAGMA [8].\nLemma 3.1. The {2, 3}-primitive solutions of the equation\ny 3 = s(s3 + 8t3 )\nhave\n\ns\n\u2208 {\u22122, 0, 1, 2, 4, \u221e}.\nt\nProof. We use the construction in the proof of Lemma 2.2. In our case, A = Q[\u03b8],\nwhere \u03b8(\u03b8 + 2)(\u03b82 \u2212 2\u03b8 + 4) = 0 and S = {2, 3}. The subgroup of A(3, S) of elements\nof cubic norm is spanned by\n\u22121/8\u03b83 \u2212 1/4\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b8 + 1,\n\u22121/24\u03b83 \u2212 1/6\u03b82 \u2212 2/3\u03b8 + 1,\n1/24\u03b83 + 1/6\u03b82 + 1/6\u03b8 + 1,\n5/24\u03b83 \u2212 5/12\u03b82 \u2212 2/3\u03b8 + 3,\n1/8\u03b83 \u2212 1/4\u03b82 \u2212 1/2\u03b8 + 2.\nFor each of the 35 possible values of \u03b4 in that group, we can write down the curve\nQ2,\u03b4 = Q3,\u03b4 = 0 as outlined in the proof of Lemma 2.2 and test the curve for local\nsolubility over Q3 . Only 22 values for \u03b4 pass this test.\nFrom the factorisation of f it follows that there are two homomorphisms m1 , m2 :\nA \u2192 Q, defined by m1 (\u03b8) = 0 and m2 (\u03b8) = \u22122. For a fixed value of \u03b4, the curve\nQ2,\u03b4 = Q3,\u03b4 = 0 covers two curves of genus 1:\nE1,\u03b4\n\n:\n\nE2,\u03b4\n\n:\n\nN (\u03b4) 3\nm1 (\u03b4) u1\nN (\u03b4) 3\nm2 (\u03b4) u2\n\n=\n\ns3 \u2212 8t3\n\n= s(s2 \u2212 2st + 4t2 )\n\nNote that (s : t : u1 ) = (2 : 1 : 0) \u2208 E1,\u03b4 (Q) and (s, t, u2 ) = (0 : 1 : 0) \u2208 E2,\u03b4 (Q), so\nboth curves are isomorphic to elliptic curves and hence their rational points have\nthe structure of a finitely generated group. For the 22 values of \u03b4, we obtain the\nresults in Table 1. For each of the values of \u03b4 at least one of E1,\u03b4 (Q) and E2,\u03b4 (Q)\n\n\fTHE PRIMITIVE SOLUTIONS TO x3 + y 9 = z 2\n\n\u03b4\n1\n\u2212 38 \u03b83 + 12 \u03b82 \u2212 23 \u03b8 + 1\n1 3\n\u03b8 \u2212 3\u03b8 + 1\n8\n1 3\n\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b8 + 1\n8\n1 3\n\u03b8 + 16 \u03b82 + 61 \u03b8 + 1\n24\n\u2212 38 \u03b83 + 34 \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b8 + 1\n\u2212 78 \u03b83 + \u03b82 \u2212 3\u03b8 + 1\n1 3\n\u03b8 \u2212 6\u03b8 + 1\n8\n\u2212 18 \u03b83 + 12 \u03b82 + 21 \u03b8 + 1\n1 3\n\u2212 24\n\u03b8 + 13 \u03b82 + 31 \u03b8 + 1\n15 3\n\u2212 8 \u03b8 + 2\u03b82 \u2212 6\u03b8 + 1\n1 3\n\u2212 12\n\u03b8 + 23 \u03b82 \u2212 34 \u03b8 + 3\n23 3\n\u2212 24\n\u03b8 + 83 \u03b82 \u2212 22\n\u03b8+3\n3\n1 3\n11 2\n4\n\u03b8\n+\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n+3\n24\n12\n3\n1 2\n5 3\n\u03b8\n+\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n2\u03b8\n+\n9\n8\n4\n\u2212 38 \u03b83 + 34 \u03b82 \u2212 21 \u03b8 + 2\n7 3\n5 2\n\u03b8 + 12\n\u03b8 \u2212 11\n\u03b8+6\n24\n6\n1 2\n5\n13 3\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n+ 18\n8\n4\n2\n3 2\n7\n5 3\n\u03b8\n+\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n+4\n8\n4\n2\n7 3\n7 2\n\u03b8 \u2212 12\n\u03b8 \u2212 65 \u03b8 + 4\n24\n23 3\n1 2\n\u03b8 + 12\n\u03b8 \u2212 13\n\u03b8 + 12\n24\n6\n5 2\n7\n29 3\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n+ 36\n8\n4\n2\n\nN (\u03b4)/m1 (\u03b4)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n9\n9\n9\n3\n4\n36\n12\n2\n2\n18\n6\n\nN (\u03b4)/m2 (\u03b4)\n1\n3\n36\n2\n1\n3\n12\n18\n9\n4\n6\n3\n6\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n1\n3\n3\n\nrkE1,\u03b4 (Q)\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n5\n\nrkE2,\u03b4 (Q)\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\nTable 1. Ranks of Ei,\u03b4 (Q) related to y 3 = s(s3 + 8t3 )\n\nis of rank 0. Hence, any {2, 3}-primitive solution must have s/t corresponding to a\ntorsion point on one of E1,\u03b4 (Q) and E2,\u03b4 (Q).\nThe group E1,\u03b4 (Q)tors is Z/3Z for N (\u03b4)/m1 (\u03b4) = 1 and Z/2Z for N (\u03b4)/m1 (\u03b4) =\n2. For other values there is no torsion. The non-trivial 3-torsion points are (s : t :\nu1 ) = (1 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2). The non-trivial 2-torsion point is (s : t : u1 ) = (2 : 1 : 8).\nThe group E2,\u03b4 (Q)tors is Z/3Z for N (\u03b4)/m1 (\u03b4) = 3 and Z/2Z for N (\u03b4)/m1 (\u03b4) =\n6.

Again we follow the procedure outlined in Lemma 2.2. For both equations,\nthe algebra A is isomorphic to the number field K(\u03b1) := Q[x]/(x4 \u2212 2x3 \u2212 2x + 1).\nIn each case, we are left with 4 values of \u03b4 for which the curve C\u03b4 : Q\u03b4,2 = Q\u03b4,3 = 0\nhas points over Q3 . Each of those curves actually has a rational point. Over K, it\ncovers the genus 1 curve\nN (\u03b4) 3 N (s \u2212 \u03b8t)\nu =\n\u03b4\ns \u2212 \u03b8t\nThe existence of a Q-rational point on C\u03b4 implies that there is a K-rational point\non E\u03b4 , which makes E\u03b4 isomorphic to an elliptic curve.

The method requires generators of a subgroup of E(K) of maximal rank.\nTable 2 lists such generators for the six elliptic curves that are encountered. A 2descent shows that these points generate a subgroup of finite index prime to 2 and\na simple check for 3-divisibility of all relevant linear combinations of these points\nthat the index is also prime to 3. We will need this later on. For the first equation,\nusing \u03b8 = \u03b12 \u2212 2\u03b1, we find that C\u03b4 (Q3 ) 6= \u2205 for the 4 values of \u03b4 listed in Table 3.\nWe also list the value of st at a point p0 \u2208 C\u03b4 (Q) and we list i such that E\u03b4 is\n\n\fTHE PRIMITIVE SOLUTIONS TO x3 + y 9 = z 2\ns\n(p0 )\nt\n\n\u03b4\n1\n\u03b13 \u2212 2\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 3\n\u22123\u03b13 + 5\u03b12 + 2\u03b1 + 7\n7\u03b13 \u2212 11\u03b12 \u2212 5\u03b1 \u2212 16\n\u03b8 = \u03b12 \u2212 2\u03b1\n\n\u221e\n0\n1\n\u22121\n\ni\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\ns\n\u03b4\n(p0 )\nt\n1\n\u221e\n\u22124\u03b13 + 8\u03b12 + 4\u03b1 + 11\n0\n1\n\u03b12 + \u03b1 + 1\n\u03b13 + \u03b12 + \u03b1\n\u22121\n\u03b8 = \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 2\n\n7\n\ni\n2\n1\n6\n5\n\nTable 3. E\u03b4 , st (p0 ) and isomorphic Ei\n\nisomorphic to Ei in Table 2. For the second equation, using \u03b8 = \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 2,\nwe find a similar set of values. Note that all the eight smooth plane cubics E\u03b4 have\na K-rational point of inflection. Thus, the isomorphism between E\u03b4 and Ei can\nbe realised by a linear change of variables. As an example, we give some data for\n\u03b4 = \u22124\u03b13 + 8\u03b12 + 4\u03b1 + 11. The point (u : s : t) = (0 : \u2212\u03b13 + \u03b12 + \u03b1 + 2 : 1) is a\npoint of inflection. If we map this point to the origin on E1 , then the function st\non E1 can be expressed as\ns\n(\u2212\u03b13 + \u03b12 + \u03b1 + 2)y + (\u2212\u03b13 + 2\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b1 + 2)\n=\n,\nt\ny + (3\u03b13 \u2212 6\u03b12 \u2212 3\u03b1 \u2212 8)\nwhere y is a coordinate of the Weierstrass model of E1 as mentioned in Table 2.\nWe find st ({g1 , \u2212g2 , \u2212g1 +g2 }) = {0, \u22123, 3}. Via a Chabauty-like argument using\nthe primes of K over 11 (see [5]), we find that these are all points in E1 (K) that\nhave values in Q under st .\nFor the other curves we can use the same method. Either the primes over 11 or\nover 31 yield sufficient information to conclude that there is only one point with a\nQ-rational value of st . This is the value listed in the tables above.\n\u0003\n4. Proof of Theorem 1.1\nGiven Lemmas 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, the proof of Theorem 1.1 is reduced to filling in\npairs of s, t giving rise to the values st listed in those lemmas in the corresponding\nparametrisations listed in Theorem 2.1. We then check if the resulting solution to\nx3 + v 3 = z 2 is weighted homogeneously equivalent with a primitive solution to\nx3 + y 9 = z 2 .\nSince the Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 give values of st for wich the first or the second\npolynomial of the third parametrization in Theorem 2.1 may be a cube, we try all\nof the values and see what we get.\ns\n\u22122\n0\n1\n1\n2\n4\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\nt\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\nsolution\n03 + 363 = 2162\n03 + 43 = (\u22128)2\n93 + 03 = (\u221227)2\n13 + 03 = 13\n3\n32 \u2212 283 = (\u2212104)2\n2883 \u2212 2523 = 28082\n\u221273 + 83 = 132\n\u2212633 + 723 = (\u2212351)2\n\nIt is easily checked that all solutions are equivalent to one occurring in the list in the\ntheorem. Note that the first four entries correspond to values of st that occur in both\n\n\f8\n\nNILS BRUIN\n\nLemma 3.1 and 3.2. Correspondingly, both cubes are ninth powers, up to {2, 3}units. The latter four values occur in only one of the lemmas and correspondingly\nhave primes different from 2, 3 dividing one of the cubes to a power not divisible\nby 9.\nFor the values of st listed in Theorem 3.3 we proceed similarly.\ns\n1\n0\n\u00b11\n\u00b13\n\nt\nsolution\n0\n13 \u2212 13 = 02\n1\n\u221233 + 33 = 02\n3\n1\n4 + 83 = (\u00b124)2\n1 1323 \u2212 243 = (\u00b11512)2\n\nThe last two solutions are interesting. The penultimate solution is obviously equivalent to 13 + 23 = 32 and, since 1 is indeed a cube, this yields a solution. The\nlast one is equivalent to 333 \u2212 63 = 1892 . Indeed, this is equivalent to the solution\n(22 * 33 * 11)3 \u2212 (2 * 3)9 = (23 * 36 * 7)2 , which is a {2, 3}-primitive solution. It is clear,\nhowever, that it is not equivalent to a truly primitive one.\n5.
