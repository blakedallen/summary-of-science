Although\nseveral options can be considered, like an anomalously long initial period or the presence of a\nfossil disc, our results indicate that SXP 1062 may host a neutron star born with a large initial\nmagnetic field, typically in excess of \u223c 1014 G, which then decayed to \u223c 1013 G.\nKey words: stars: neutron \u2013 X-rays: binaries: SXP 1062.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nBe/X-ray binaries (or BeXBs for short) form a subclass of the highmass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in which the neutron star (NS) companion is a Be star, a spectral class B giant/subgiant with emission\nlines and large IR flux. These peculiar properties are explained in\nterms of an equatorial disc, formed by matter lost by the rapidly\nrotating Be star. X-ray emission is believed to be powered by accretion of material in the equatorial disc onto the NS (see e.g. Reig\n2011, for a recent review).\nBeXBs are both transient and persistent X-ray sources. Transient systems are characterized by type I-II outbursts during which\ntheir flux increases by a factor 10\u2013104 over the quiescent level.\nThey typically contain a not-too-slow NS (P . 100 s) on a moderately eccentric orbit, Porb . 100 d, e & 0.2. On the other hand,\npersistent BeXBs exhibit a rather flat lightcurve, lower X-ray luminosity (L \u2248 1034 \u20131035 erg s\u22121 ), longer spin and orbital periods\n(P & 200 s, Porb & 200 d; see again Reig 2011).\nThere are presently about 30 well-established BeXBs in the\nGalaxy, plus \u223c 40 candidates. In addition, \u223c 50 sources (plus \u223c 20\ncandidates) are known in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)1 .\nVery recently H\u00e9nault-Brunet et al. (2012) reported the discovery of a new BeXB in the Wing of the SMC. The new source\n(SXP 1062) has the typical properties of a persistent BeXB: a B0-\n\n0.5(III)e+ donor, L \u223c 6 \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 , P \u223c 1062 s, and an\norbital period Porb \u223c 300 d, as estimated from the Corbet diagram (Corbet et al. 2009). What makes SXP 1062 to stand out\namongst its kinship is its (likely) association with a supernova remnant (SNR). BeXB-SNR associations have been already reported\n(again in the SMC) but in all previous cases they appear uncertain\n(Hughes & Smith 1994; Coe, Haigh & Reig 2000). In the case of\nSXP 1062 the association looks robust and allows for the first time\nto estimate the NS age in a BeXB from that of the parent SNR,\n\u03c4 \u223c 2\u20134 \u00d7 104 yr (H\u00e9nault-Brunet et al. 2012). The suggested\nassociation of SXP 1062 with a SNR has been further strengthened by a reanalysis of the same XMM-Newton datasets, supplemented with optical and radio observations, by Haberl et al. (2012).\nTheir estimate for the SNR age, 1.6 \u00d7 104 yr, is even shorter\nthan, albeit fully compatible with, that of H\u00e9nault-Brunet et al.\n(2012). Haberl et al. (2012) were also able to measure the source\nperiod evolution, which results in a positive (i.e. spin-down) rate\n\u1e56 \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 s s\u22121 \u223c 95 s yr\u22121 .\nThe long spin periods (P & 1000 s) of some persistent BeXBs\nhave been for a long time a major issue. According to the standard picture, there are four stages in the spin evolution of a neutron star embedded in a medium: ejector, propeller, accretor and\ngeorotator2 (e.g. Lipunov 1992). Once the NS entered the accretor stage after a short propeller phase, its spin period quickly settles at an equilibrium value, Peq . In the conventional model, based\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: sergepolar@gmail.com\nFigures from Reig (2011) and the BeXB online catalogue at\nhttp://xray.sai.msu.ru/ \u0303 raguzova/BeXcat; see also Raguzova & Popov\n(2005).\n1\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\n2 The last one is of no concern here, since it occurs under specific conditions, hardly met in HMXBs.\n\n\f2\n\nS.B. Popov & R. Turolla\n\non Davies & Pringle (1981) results, the star dipole field should be\nB & 1014 G to have Peq > 103 s, unless the accretion rate is orders of magnitude below what needed to account for the observed\nX-ray luminosity. Since observations support the presence of a NS\nwith standard magnetic field (at least in some BeXBs), the subsonic propeller stage, which can delay the onset of accretion until a\nmuch longer period is reached (Ikhsanov 2007), has been invoked\nto explain ultra-slow BeXBs (see Reig 2011). More recent investigations of wind-fed accretion onto magnetized NSs indicate, however, that the equilibrium period can be as high as \u223c 1000 s even\nfor B \u2248 1012 \u20131013 G and \u1e40 \u2248 1016 g s\u22121 , as expected in BeXBs\n(Shakura et al. 2012).\nWhatever the details of the braking torques, the previous argument implicitly relies on the assumption that the present age\nof the source is long enough for the NS to have entered the propeller stage. Unless the accretion rate is way above typical, a NS\nin a BeXB with B & 1012 G starts its evolution in the ejector (or pulsar) phase. Its duration can be roughly estimated as\n\u03c4ej & 106 (B/1012 G)\u22121 (\u1e40 /1015 g s\u22121 )\u22121/2 yr (see Section 2).\nThis is comfortably below (by a factor \u2248 10) the lifetime of the\nBe companion, so there is ample room for the binary to start an\naccretion-powered X-ray stage. In the case of SXP 1062, however,\nit would be impossible for the NS to enter the propeller stage (and\nhence to become an accretor) in a time as short as a few \u00d7104 yr,\nthe estimated SNR age, for typical values of B and \u1e40 . The accretion rate in SXP 1062 is \u1e40 = L/\u03b7c2 \u223c 6 \u00d7 1015 g s\u22121 for an\nefficiency \u03b7 = 0.1, so this points to a highly magnetized NS, with\nan initial magnetic field substantially above 1012 G.\n\n2 SPIN EVOLUTION IN SXP 1062\n2.1 Spin-down torques\nIn the standard picture of NS spin evolution (see e.g. Lipunov\n1992), the transitions among the different stages are regulated\nby the relative values of some characteristic radii. In the ejector\nphase the light cylinder radius, Rl = cP/2\u03c0 \u223c 5 \u00d7 109 P cm,\nis typically smaller than the gravitational capture radius, RG =\n\u22122\ncm, where V is the velocity (and \u03c1 the\n2GM/V 2 \u223c 4 \u00d7 1011 V300\ndensity) of matter far from the star3 . A NS with MNS = 1.4 M\u2299 ,\nRNS = 10 km and moment of inertia I = 1045 g cm2 is assumed\nhenceforth. The transition to the propeller stage occurs when the\nram pressure, Pdyn = \u03c1V 2 /2, balances the outgoing flux of electromagnetic waves and relativistic particles, PP SR = \u0116/(4\u03c0R2 c),\nat RG (\u0116 is the rotational energy loss rate of the pulsar). Once matter crosses RG it is gravitationally captured and quickly reaches the\nlight cylinder radius switching off pulsar emission, since the dynamical pressure (assuming a nearly spherical flow) rises as R\u22125/2 ,\nwhile the relativistic momentum flux goes like R\u22122 .\nThe critical period for the transition follows by requiring that\nPdyn (RG ) = PP SR (RG ) together with the standard expression\n6\nfor magneto-dipole losses, \u0116 = 8\u03c0 4 B 2 RNS\nsin2 \u03b1/(3c3 P 4 ) and\n2\nmass conservation, 4\u03c0RG \u03c1V = \u1e40 ,\n\nPej = 2\u03c0\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n6\n4 B 2 RNS\n3 \u1e40 V c4\n\n\u00131/4\n\n\u22121/4\n\n\u22121/4\n\n\u223c 0.31 V300 \u1e4016\n\n1/2\n\nB12 s; (1)\n\nHereafter V300 \u2261 (V /300 km s\u22121 ), Porb 300 \u2261 (Porb /300 d),\nP1000 \u2261 (P/1000 s) and NX is used for the quantity N in units of\n10X cgs.\n\nsince the NS is not accreting, here \u1e40 is more properly defined as\nthe matter flow rate in the surrounding medium and we assumed\na nearly orthogonal rotator (sin \u03b1 \u223c 1). From the magneto-dipole\nformula, assuming constant B and very short initial period, the time\nit takes the NS to spin down to Pej , i.e. the duration of the ejector\nstage, can be evaluated\n\n\u03c4ej =\n\n2\n3Ic3 Pej\n\u22121/2 \u22121/2 \u22121\nMyr.\n\u223c 1.5 \u1e4016 V300 B12\n6\n2\n2\n16\u03c0 B RNS\n\n(2)\n\nThe dipole field in a wind-fed NS has been estimated by\nShakura et al. (2012) under the assumption that the star is spinning\nat the equilibrium period (see also Postnov et al. 2011),\n\n1/3\n\n\u221211/3\n\nB12 \u223c 8.1 \u1e4016 V300\n\n\u0012\n\nP1000\nPorb 300\n\n\u001311/12\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThe previous expressions give \u03c4ej \u223c 0.2 Myr for SXP 1062, about\nan order of magnitude larger than the estimated SNR age. Our reference value, V \u223c 300 km s\u22121 , is a conservative estimate for the\ntypical velocity of matter ejected from hot stars in binaries (see\nRaguzova & Lipunov 1998). Actually, since Eq. (3) depends rather\nstrongly on V , higher velocities would result in a lower magnetic\nfield and longer \u03c4ej .\nWithin this framework, an obvious possibility to shorten the\nejector phase in SXP 1062 is to invoke a higher dipole field. However, if the present field is that given by Eq. (3) this implies that\nB must have been stronger in the past and then decayed to its\npresent value. The issue of magnetic field evolution in isolated NSs\nand its observable consequences has been recently addressed in detail, especially in connection with strongly magnetized objects, or\nmagnetars (e.g. Pons, Miralles & Geppert 2009; Popov et al. 2010;\nTurolla et al. 2011, and references therein). In these studies it is\nassumed that magnetic field decay takes place in the stellar crust\nand is driven by Hall/Ohmic diffusion. Both processes are strongly\ndensity- and temperature- dependent, so magnetic and thermal evolution are necessary coupled, and a multidimensional numerical approach is needed (Pons, Miralles & Geppert 2009).\nSince we are interested in tracing the spin evolution of SXP\n1062 prior it entered the accretor stage, we can treat the NS as isolated for the sake of magnetic evolution. In order to avoid complex numerical simulations, we adopt the simplified approach of\nAguilera et al. (2008) in which the dipole magnetic field decay is\ndescribed by the analytical law\nB(t) =\n\nB0 exp (\u2212t/\u03c4O )\n+ Bf in ,\n1 + (\u03c4O /\u03c4H )[1 \u2212 exp (\u2212t/\u03c4O )]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B0 is the initial field, Bf in is the relic field, \u03c4O and \u03c4H are\nthe characteristic timescales of Ohmic and Hall decay, respectively.\nThe period evolution in the ejector stage is given by the (generalized) magneto-dipole formula\n\n\u1e56 =\n\n6\n8\u03c0 2 B 2 RNS\n(1 + sin2 \u03b1)\n3Ic3 P\n\n(5)\n\n(Spitkovsky 2006), where B is given by Eq. (4).\nThe NS enters the propeller phase as soon as the dynamical\npressure exerted by the incoming material overwhelms the pulsar\nmomentum flux at the gravitational radius, as discussed above. If\nno stable equilibrium exists, matter will reach the light cylinder radius on a free-fall timescale, and proceed inwards if the ram pressure overcomes the magnetic pressure of the dipole field, Pmag =\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20135\n\n\fNeutron star spin evolution in the Be/X-ray binary SXP 1062\nB 2 /8\u03c0. Ek\u015fi & Alpar (2005) have shown that stable matter configurations can be present even if the inner boundary of the flow,\nRin , is outside Rl . This occurs when Rin < Rcrit = F (\u03b1)RA ,\nwith F (\u03b1) > 1 a function of the magnetic tilt angle and4 RA =\n12/7\n(1/2)B 4/7 RNS /(8GMNS \u1e40 2 )1/7 . For Rl < Rin < Rcrit , the\npulsar is still active and the star is spun down by magneto-dipole\ntorque. Under these conditions Ek\u015fi & Alpar (2005) provide an expression for Rin in terms of \u03b1 and RA . When Rin < Rl , instead,\nthe flow is truncated at the Alfv\u00e9n radius, where Pdyn = Pmag , the\npulsar is turned off and only propeller torques act.\nThe propeller physics is very complicated and no unanimous\nconsensus exists about the form of the torque. However, since spindown is expected to be very efficient in the propeller phase, its duration is quite short. The period rapidly increases and the corotation\nradius, Rco = [GMNS /(4\u03c0 2 )]1/3 P 2/3 , moves quickly outwards\nuntil it matches the Alfv\u00e9n radius, at which point accretion begins\nand the period freezes at the equilibrium value. While the latter depends on the propeller/accretion mechanisms, and several options\nhave been discussed (see Sec. 1), the duration of the ejector phase\ndoes not. For this reason we consider here only the \"maximally\nefficient torque\" (see e.g. Francischelli & Wijers 2002), as an illustrative example:\n2\n\u1e56 = \u2212\u1e40 Rin\n[\u03a9K (Rin ) \u2212 2\u03c0/P ]\n\nP2\n\u03c0I\n\n(7)\n\n\u22124 \u22121\nPorb 300 , C \u223c\nHere A \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 1032 K1 (B12 RNS 6 )1/11 V300\n31\n13/11 \u22121\n5.4 \u00d7 10 K1 (B12 RNS 6 )\nP1000 (both in cgs units); the constant K1 and the index n were fixed to 40 and 2, respectively.

[5], [6], [7]) starting from t0 = 0.01 yr with an\ninitial period P0 = 0.01 s. The accretion rate was fixed to the value\nderived from current observations, \u1e40 = 6 \u00d7 1015 g/s, together\nwith Porb = 300 d, V = 300 km s\u22121 , \u03c4O = 106 yr and Bf in =\n8\u00d71012 G. Several cases were then computed varying the magnetic\ndipole angle \u03b1, the Hall timescale \u03c4H and especially the initial field\nB0 . Figure 1 illustrates the results for \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 , \u03c4H = 103 yr and\nB0 = 4\u00d71014 , 1014 , 7\u00d71013 , 4\u00d71013 , 1013 G. A common feature\nto all evolutionary tracks is a very rapid propeller stage which is\nfollowed by an even more rapid spin-down phase as the NS enters\nthe accretion regime. The period then saturates at its equilibrium\nvalue. The decrease in P seen at later times for the larger fields is\ndue to the dependence of Peq on B and to the fact that the field\n4\n\nAlthough RA formally coincides with the Alfv\u00e9n radius, we remark\nthat the latter exists only inside the light cylinder radius. Nonetheless, the\npresent definition is correct, provided that RA is not associated to the equilibrium of dynamical and magnetic pressure.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20135\n\nFigure 1.

The time variation of B is also\nresponsible for the deviations of P (t) from a power-law in the later\nejector phase, which are, again, more prominent for large B.\nThe main information Figure 1 conveys is that a quite large\ninitial field is required in order for SXP 1062 to enter the propeller phase (and quickly start accreting) in a time as short as a few\n\u00d7104 yr. For the case shown here it has to be B0 & 1014 G for this\nto occur. This result is not very sensitive to the actual choice of \u03b1\nand \u03c4H . Both increasing \u03b1 and decreasing \u03c4H results in a somehow\nhigher value of the minimum initial field, which is however in all\ncases in the range \u223c 1014 \u2013 4 \u00d7 1014 G. The conclusion that SXP\n1062 harbours an initially strongly magnetized NS seems therefore\nquite robust.\nWe stress that our main goal is not to reproduce within the current model the observed value of P at the present age. Although, for\ncompleteness, we followed the spin evolution also in the propeller\nand accretor stages, the treatment we employed is necessary approximated and contains some degrees of arbitrariness in the choice\nof the propeller/accretor torques. Our computed evolution past the\nejector phase has mainly an illustrative purpose and has to be taken\nwith caution.\n\n3 DISCUSSION\nThe quite short age implied by the association of the newly\ndiscovered BeXB in the SMC SXP 1062 with a SNR\n(H\u00e9nault-Brunet et al. 2012; Haberl et al. 2012) raises a number\nof questions about the properties of the neutron star and its evolutionary status. Normally, one expects that accreting X-ray pulsars spin close to their equilibrium period. However, for a such a\nyoung system this appears far from granted. Haberl et al. (2012)\nreported a large spin-down rate for SXP 1062, which may suggest\nthat Peq has not been reached yet. According to the standard evolutionary scenario (Lipunov 1992), the (maximum) spin-down rate\n6\nin the accretor stage is \u1e56 \u223c 2\u03c0B 2 RNS\n/(GM I) which implies\n14\n\u22121\nB \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 G for \u1e56 \u2248 100 s yr . On the other hand, if Eq.\n\n\f4\n\nS.B. Popov & R. Turolla\n\n(7) is used to estimate the magnetic field, a much lower value is\nobtained, B \u2248 1013 G, very close to what is predicted assuming\nthat the source spins at the equilibrium period (see Eq. [3]). This\nsupports a picture in which the NS actually rotates close to Peq .\nA further argument in favor of this is the very short duration of\nthe spin-down phase in the accretor stage, P/\u1e56 . 100 yr, which\nmakes it very unlikely to catch the source in this state. Our conclusion is that both the young age and the large spin-down rate of\nSXP 1062 argue in favor of an initially highly magnetic NS which\nexperienced field decay.\nDetails of evolution past the ejector stage are uncertain, so a\nfine tuning of the model discussed in Sec. 2 is entirely premature.\nStill, some general considerations can be made. The main one is\nthat the timescale required for reaching Peq after the NS left the\nejector stage is very short. A further point to be stressed is that the\nzero, or negative, period derivative at P = Peq (see Figure 1) does\nnot account for variations in \u1e40 due to orbital motion in the BeXB\nand irregularities in the wind. This can result in quite large values of\n\u1e56 and rapid changes in the period derivative which are indeed measured in wind-fed X-ray binaries (see e.g. Bildstein et al. 1997). In\nthis respect the spin-down rate in SXP 1062 is large but not exceptionally so. For example, GX 301-2 is known to have a larger value\nof \u1e56 (Koh et al. 1997). Haberl et al. (2012) measured the average\nperiod derivative over a time-span less than a month, \u223c one tenth\nof the orbital period. Fluctuations in \u1e56 can occur on a timescale of\ndays, so a more complete dataset is definitely needed to assess the\nreal nature of the period variation.\nAlternative scenarios to explain the long period and short age\nof SXP 1062 can be envisaged. For instance, Haberl et al. (2012)\nsuggested that the NS could have been born with an initial period\nmuch longer than \u223c 0.01 s. The value of P0 can be evaluated by\nrequiring that the transition period given by Eq. (1) is reached in\nless than the source age, and it turns out to be \u223c 1 s for the B-field\ncorresponding to Peq [Eq. (3)]. If this is the case no field decay is\nrequired. Although possible, no compelling observational evidence\nfor such long initial periods in NSs exists. There are hints that some\ncentral compact objects (CCOs) in SNRs may have a current period very close to the initial one, P0 \u2248 0.1 s. These sources, however, are suspected to host weakly magnetized NSs (B \u2248 1011 G;\ne.g. Gotthelf & Halpern 2010). Whether the low field and the long\nperiod are related, depending on the conditions under which the\nNS formed, is still unclear. Still, the estimated value of B in SXP\n1062 is much higher and the initial period required in the present\ncase is more than one order of magnitude longer. Very recently\nKnigge, Coe & Podsiadlowski (2012) presented evidence that the\npopulation of BeBXs is bimodal, with the two sub-populations having distinct typical spin and orbital periods, and eccentricities. They\nsuggest that the NSs in the two groups are produced through different channels, iron-core-collapse and electron capture supernovae,\nwith the long spin period sources associated to the former channel.\nWhether this may result in a population of long P0 NSs is a still\nopen question.\nAnother possibility is that the NS in SXP 1062 could, at least\nin the early stages following its formation, have been surrounded\nby a debris (or fossil) disc, left by the parent supernova explosion.\nThe existence of such a disc could also lead to rapid spin-down\nand large period. This, in addition to a super-strong field, was suggested to explain the ultra-long period (\u223c 6.67 hr) in the enigmatic\nsource RCW 103 (De Luca et al. 2006; Li 2007). Although this remains a possibility worth of further investigations, preliminary calculations, based on the model by Li (2007, see also Esposito et al.\n2011), indicate that a large initial field (B & 1014 G) is still re-\n\nquired, unless the disc is quite massive. For Mdisc (0) \u223c 10\u22122 M\u2299 ,\nthe NS can enter the propeller stage earlier than \u223c 104 yr also for\nB \u223c 1013 G.\nIf SXP 1062 indeed contains an initially strongly magnetized\nneutron star, then studies of this system can shed light on the origin of magnetars. In the standard scenario (Duncan & Thompson\n1992) super-strong fields are generated via dynamo processes. This\nrequires rapid rotation of the proto neutron star. Primary components in high-mass binary systems are not expected to form rapidly\nrotating cores at the end of their lives (Popov & Prokhorov 2006;\nBogomazov & Popov 2009). Up to now no strongly magnetized\ncompact objects have been identified in binary systems with certainty. Chashkina & Popov (2012) have recently derived estimates\nof the B-field in HMXBs using Shakura et al. (2012) formula\nand no evidence of ultra-high fields was found. It has been suggested that supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs, see e.g. Sidoli\n2011, for a review) may host a magnetar (Bozzo, Falanga & Stella\n2008). More recently, Torres et al. (2012) reported magnetar-like\nbehaviour from the peculiar binary LS I +61 303. However, no definite confirmation has been given yet, and, in this respect, SXP 1062\nmay be a unique example. The existence of a (evolved) magnetar in\na high-mass binary system will pose new challenges on the origin\nof such neutron stars.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSBP gratefully acknowledges a Visiting Scientist grant from the\nUniversity of Padova and the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Padova for the hospitality during the period this investigation was carried out.
