In fact these considerations are often generalized to configurations which are not exact solutions of the field equations but close to them and\nwhich we will name quasi-classical field configurations.\nFamous examples of non-trivial solutions of classical equations of motion are\ninstantons [1, 2]. Quasi-classical solutions considered in instanton liquid models [3, 4] provide a successful connection between the instanton zero modes and\nthe QCD chiral symmetry breaking (See ref. [5] for a good review on the subject).\n1\n\nUnit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche du CNRS - UMR 8627\n\n1\n\n\fMore recently, it has been proven in ref. [6] that instanton model predictions\nfor quark-quark interaction agree with non-perturbative QCD lattice results better than those from Schwinger-Dyson (SD) models with a perturbative structure of the QCD interaction (vector quark-gluon coupling parametrization). In\ngeneral, a dominance of instanton-induced effects on the dynamics of the QCD\nlight-quark sector seems to emerge, although it is not excluded that SD models\nwith pseudo-scalar and scalar quark-gluon couplings might capture this emerging\ninstanton physics. On the other hand, despite instantons have been first considered as a possible explanation of confinement [7], it is now generally accepted\nthat they do not generate the area law for Wilson loops 2 .\nWe have recently argued [8] that instantons, or instanton-like structures, have\ndramatic effects on the low momentum Green function in Yang-Mills theories and\nthat they can explain the observed \u221d k 4 behaviour of the non-perturbative MOM\nQCD coupling constant computed on the lattice. Notice that this remark, not\nonly advocates in favor of the presence of these quasi-classical structures in the\nlattice gauge configurations, but also indicates that the quantum fluctuations do\nnot contribute significantly to the Green functions in this momentum regime. In\nthe present paper we try a low momentum description of two- and three-gluon\nGreen functions through Instanton liquid model (ILM).\nThe succesful description of the MOM QCD coupling constant in the lowmomentum regime is based on the sum-ansatz approach, that builds the classical\nsolution as a linear combination of modified instantons. Although instanton\nprofile modifications play no role in obtaining the coupling constant, at least in\nthe first approximation, any description of two- and three-gluon Green functions\nmakes mandatory to further elaborate on the nature of this modifications. To\nthis goal we will follow the Diakonov & Petrov (DP) sum-ansatz approach [4]. As\nwill be discussed later, different aspects of this approach have been criticised by\nShuryak and Verbaarshot, but it provides us with a framework able to estimate\ninstanton effects through analytical or semi-analytical computations which seem\nto work reasonably well. This is the \"phenomenological\" point of view which\nwe adopt in this paper to extract some understanding of the low-momentum\nbehaviour of lattice Green functions.\nThe paper is organized in six sections. In section 2 we discuss the pattern of\nthe running with momenta of the QCD coupling constant. Section 3 is devoted\nto study the instanton profile modification within the DP approach. In section\n4, we show that the low momentum behaviour of lattice gluon Green functions is\nrather well described by ILM only after including instanton profile modifications\nand discuss how the large instanton density obtained from the fits is expected\nto be reduced by light dynamical quarks in full QCD. In section 5, the effect of\ninstanton radius distribution is discussed. We finally conclude in section 6.\n2\n\nAnother set of solutions of classical field equations, merons [9], has been recently reexamined\nas candidates to explain confinement [10].\n\n2\n\n\fAt the end of the day, of course, rather important questions still remain open:\nwhy do quantum effects appear to be suppressed in this low momentum range ?\nHas this some connection with confinement ?\n\n2\n\nThe QCD coupling constant: four regimes\n\nWe have presented in Ref. [8] a preliminary claim of instanton dominance at\nlow energy by analyzing in Landau gauge the following ratio of pure Yang-Mills\nGreen functions:\n\u00012\n\u0012\n\u00132\nk 6 G(3) (k 2 , k 2 , k 2 )\n1 G(3) (k 2 , k 2 , k 2 ) 3/2\n2\n2\n=\nZMOM (k )\n,\n(1)\n\u03b1s (k ) =\n3\n4\u03c0\n(G(2) (k 2 ))3\n4\u03c0\n(G(2) (k 2 ))\nwhich is a non-perturbative MOM definition of the coupling constant, where\nG(n) is the gluon n-point correlation function and ZMOM = k 2 G(2) is the gluon\npropagator renormalization constant in MOM scheme 3 .\nIn Fig. 1 we show on a log-log plot, that a roughly-k 4 power law is satisfied\nby the lattice evaluations of \u03b1s (k 2 ), eq. (1), up to 0.8-0.9 GeV, for three different\nlattices, strongly supporting a quasi-classical description [8].\nA very striking feature of the results shown in Fig. 1, obtained with a low\nstatistics of 20 configurations, is that there is a rather sharp transition at \u223c 1GeV\nbetween two regimes: below this scale \u03b1s (k 2 ) does not seem to fluctuate much, it\nagrees well, with a small \u03c72 , with the expected k 4 linear behaviour in spite of the\nsmall statistics and it complies with an instanton-like picture, while above that\nscale the data suddenly deviate from the k 4 law and become apparently fuzzier 4 ,\na fuzziness which is confirmed by the larger \u03c72 which affects any smooth fit. A\ntempting interpretation is that this fuzziness has to do with a strong influence of\nquantum fluctuations which increase suddenly above 1 GeV. We may understand\nthis as follows: for a given profile and a given instanton radius, the ILM predicts\nno statistical fluctuation of the Green functions. The average over the instantons\nlocations and their color orientation does not create any noise on Green functions\nwhich are translational and color rotation invariant. Only the dispersion (to be\nstudied at length in this paper) of the instanton radius as well as varying effects of\nthe neighbouring instantons produces some statistical noise. On the contrary the\nquantum contributions to Green function are generated by statistical fluctuations\nof the gauge fields around zero and Green functions appear as correlations in this\nstatistical system. Some confirmation of this interpretation results of the analysis\nof the same gluon Green functions after applying a cooling procedure that kills\nshort-distance (quantum) correlations [11].\nAltogether we may distinguish four regimes:\n3\n\nWe keep the name \"coupling constant\" for this well defined quantity although it could be\nargued that this name is not really appropriate in the low momentum regime.\n4\nThe smooth curve shown in fig 1(b) in [8] has been reached with 1000 configurations.\n\n3\n\n\f\u2022 Above 2.6 GeV we have shown [12, 13] that the lattice data were dominated by perturbative QCD with a significant non-perturbative correction\ndescribable via OPE by the expectation value of A2 . This means clearly a\ndominance of quantum fluctuations with small corrections from the A2 condensate which may be generated by the quasi-classical solutions. Indeed the\nquasi-classical solutions, being large structures, are seen by the hard propagating gluons as an effectively translational invariant background. It is then\neasy to show that their dominant effect is amenable to an OPE treatment\nof the lowest dimension operator: A2 [14].\n\u2022 Between \u223c 0.4 and \u223c 0.9 GeV the quasi-classical contributions dominate\nand the quantum effects are strongly depressed.\n\u2022 The 1.0 to 2.6 GeV region shows a strong quantum effect. However, it is\nnot at all describable in terms of perturbation theory. A description in\nterms of quantum fluctuations in a quasi-classical background should be\ntried. The latter background can no longer be treated as simply as in the\nlarge momentum regime. Other non-perturbative effects may also play a\nrole, for example related to confinement.\n\u2022 The very low momentum region below \u223c 0.4 GeV is still \"terra incognita\" and, being of the order of 2\u03c0/L, (L being the lattice length) possibly\nstrongly sensitive to finite volume artifacts.\n\n3\n\nA modified profile for the instanton-liquid model\n\nIn the following, we will try to describe the Green functions assuming that the relevant quasi-classical solutions are instanton liquids. Let us compute the quantity\nin eq. (1). We describe gluon fields in the low energy regime as a superposition\nof modified instantons, a quasi-classical background dominance being assumed.\nIn this framework, the gauge field in Landau gauge will be given by:\n\ng\n\nB\u03bca (x)\n\n=2\n\nX\ni\n\na\u03b1\nR(i)\n\n\u2212 z\u03bdi )\n\u03c6\n(x \u2212 z i )2\n\n(x\u03bd\n\u03b7 \u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\n|x \u2212 z i |\n\u03c1i\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere z i (\u03c1i ) are the center (radius) of the instantons, \u03b7\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd is known as 't Hooft\na\u03b1\nsymbol, R(i)\nare color rotations embedding the canonical SU(2) instanton into\nthe SU(3) gauge group, \u03b1 = 1, 3 (a = 1, 8) is an SU(2) (SU(3)) color index, and\nthe sum is extended over instantons and anti-instantons.\nThe classical solution for an isolated instanton is the standard BPST one,\n\u03c6(\u03be) = 1/(\u03be 2 + 1) [1]. Nevertheless, the superposition (2) with a BPST profile\nis not a solution of Yang-Mills equations (since they are not linear).

The factor g n for n-points Green\nfunctions in l.h.s. of eq. (3) comes from the factor g in the l.h.s. of eq. (2).\n5\nThe function \u03c6 in eq. (2) is related to the function P in eq. (6) of ref. [8] by the relation\nP (\u03be 2 ) = 2\u03c6(\u03be)/\u03be 2 .\n6\nThis means that we neglect the color correlation which might exist, for example, between\nneighbouring instantons, an assumption which is usually done and which amounts to consider\nthis instanton liquid as not being ordered.\n\n5\n\n\fThen, from Eq. (1) we get:\n\u03b1s (I) (k) =\n\nk 4 < \u03c19 I(k\u03c1)3 >2\n.\n18\u03c0n < \u03c16 I(k\u03c1)2 >3\n\n(5)\n\nAs a first approximation, if we consider all instantons to have the same radius,\nwe obviously obtain:\n< \u03c19 I(k\u03c1)3 >2\n= 1,\n< \u03c16 I(k\u03c1)2 >3\n\n(6)\n\nand recover an exact k 4 -power law for any instanton profile.\nIn (6) the influence of the profile will only appear as a sub-leading contribution, that will also depend on the instanton radius distribution (See section 5.),\nwhile in (3) the leading contributions to the Green functions depend on the profile\nand will therefore be used by us to gain some understanding about the instanton\nradial shape and radii. Indeed, it will be manifest (see fig. 3) that the BPST\nprofile cannot account for the low momentum behaviour of Green functions.\nThe variational Diakonov & Petrov equation.\nIf the QCD vacuum can be understood as an instanton liquid of finite density\n(See [5], for example), the BPST profile will no longer be valid (it is only a zero\ndensity limit) especially at large distance from the instanton center where the\noverlap of neighboring instantons becomes important. Being interested in the\nlow momentum regime we cannot neglect these effects.\nA possible method to include the effect of instanton interactions, is to study\nthe profile that minimizes the action of the instanton ensemble. Such a procedure\nwas used in [4], where, through the Feynman variational principle, the equation\n\u0013\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\nx2 \u03b4CNC\n\u03b1DP\nx2\n2\n3\n2 d\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n3\u03c6\n+\n2\u03c6\n+\n=0,\n\u2212 x\n\u03c6\n+\n1\n+\ndx2\n4\n6\u03b2(\u03c1) \u03b4\u03c6\n(7)\nwas obtained for the best profile, \u03c6, eq. (6.7) in [4] 7 . In the last term \u03b2(\u03c1) =\n8\u03c0 2 /g 2 (\u03c1) where g(\u03c1) is the running coupling constant evaluated at the instanton\nradius scale and CNC is a factor containing the quantum corrections that multiply\nthe instanton liquid partition function and are basically defined by the functional\ndeterminants in eq. (2.19) of [4].The value of \u03b1DP which represents an average\nclassical effect of the other instantons on one of them is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\n4 2 \u03b2(\u03c1)\nx\n2\n2 2\n\u03b1DP = \u03b30 n\n> .\n(8)\n<\ndx \u03c6\n3\n\u03b2(\u03c1)\n\u03c1\n0\n7\n\nWe correct for a factor x2 in the last term which misprinted in the quoted paper. The same\nfor the square of the function \u03c6 in eq. (8).\n\n6\n\n\fwhere the parameter \u03b30 is related to the instanton interaction strength,\n\u03b302 =\n\n27Nc \u03c0 2\n.\n4(Nc2 \u2212 1)\n\n(9)\n\nThus, if we assume the same radius for all the instantons, this equation reduces\nto\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\n9Nc \u03c0 2\nx\n2\n2 2\n\u03b1DP \u2243 2\n.\n(10)\nn\ndx \u03c6\nNc \u2212 1 0\n\u03c1\nThe last term in eq. (7), involving a functional derivative of the functional\ndeterminants, is hard to compute and explicitely violates scale invariance (in the\nsense that \u03c6( xa ) is still a solution if n is divided by a4 ). Let us remark that this\nis true only if we do not take into account the \u03c1 dependance of \u03b1DP due to \u03b2(\u03c1).\nNow assuming that \u03b1DP is approximately constant, it is argued in [4] (discussion before eq. (6.1)) that one can neglect this term to get a scale invariant\nequation governing the large distance shape of the profile function assumed to\nbe dominated by classical interaction. Of course, we should borrow from the neglected term some scale invariance breaking to fix the instanton size and match\nto the BPST solution at small distances. This can be done e.g. by explicitely\nwriting the profile as a function of |x|/\u03c1, \u03c1 defining the instanton size through\nthe condition \u03c6(1) = 1/2.\nThe term in \u03b1DP enforces a squeezing of the instantons and therefore controls\nthe large x behaviour of \u03c6(x). For |x| \u226b \u03c1 we can neglect in Eq. (7) the non\nlinear terms obtaining the following Bessel equation:\n\u001a\n\n\u0001\nd\nd2\n2\n2\n+\n|x|\n\u2212\n4\n+\n\u03b1\nx\nx\nDP\nd|x|2\nd|x|\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n|x|\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n= 0.\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore we have:\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n|x|\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\u03b1DP |x|\n\u223c c K2 (\u03b1DP |x|) \u223c c e p\n,\n|x|\nx\u226b\u03c1\n\n(12)\n\nwhere c is an unknown coefficient which could be determined from the scale\ninvariance breaking condition. Let us make further remarks about Eq. (7) after\nneglecting the CNC term: the authors of [4] claim that at small x the term\n2\nproportional to \u03b1DP\nx2 becomes small and therefore can be neglected, recovering\nthe instanton equation. This term is nevertheless not negligeable wih respect to\n\u03c6 \u2212 3\u03c62 + 2\u03c63 which tends to 0 when x \u2192 0. Furthermore this equation has no\nsolution going to 0 at infinity and to 1 at x = 0 because a singularity emerges at\nsome small finite value of x.\n7\n\n\fFor the above reasons, we prefere to use in the next sections instead of direct\nsolutions of eq. (11) the following parametrization:\n\u0012\n\n|x|\n\u03c6\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n(\u03b1DP \u03c1)2\n=\n2\n\nK2 (\u03b1DP x)\n,\n(\u03b1DP \u03c1)2\nK2 (\u03b1DP x)\n1+\n2\n\nthat behaves as K2 (\u03b1DP |x|) at x \u226b \u03c1\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\n|x|\n\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n8\n\n(13)\n\nand at short distances as:\n\n\u03c12\n= 2\n+ O(\u03b1DP x) ,\n\u03c1 + x2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere for \u03b1DP x \u226a 1 we indeed recover the BPST instanton. Remember that\nthe zero \u03b1DP limit is also, from eq. (10), the zero density limit. Notice that\nthe imposed constraint, expressed by eq. (14), of a behaviour a la BPST at\n\u03b1DP x \u226a 1 is de facto the scale invariance breaking condition in our approach. It\ndiffers slightly from DP's proposal \u03c6(1) = 1/2 since \u03c6(1) = 1/2 \u2212 (\u03b1DP \u03c1)2 /16 +\nO((\u03b1DP \u03c1)4). For the values of \u03b1DP and \u03c1 which we will use to fit the lattice\ndata both are in practice equivalent. We show in fig. 2 a plot of this profile for\nx/\u03c1 > 1/2 compared to a numerical solution of Eq. (7) equal to 1/2 at x/\u03c1 = 1\nand going to 0 at infinity (for \u03b1DP \u03c1 = 0.675). In the following, we will consider\neq. (13) as our optimal choice for the profile function.\n\n4\n\nGreen functions\n\nThe goal of this section is to apply the parameterization in eq. (13) to fit our\nnumerical results, obtaining thus \u03c1, \u03b1DP and the instanton density. We start by\nwriting the gauge field as the addition of a classical part, B\u03bca (x), and a quantum\none, QB (x), depending in general on the classical background:\nAa\u03bc (x) = B\u03bca (x) + (QB )a\u03bc (x) ,\n\n(15)\n\nthen, for the two-point gluon Green function, we can write 9 :\nhAa\u03bc (0)Ab\u03bd (x)i = hB\u03bca (0)B\u03bdb (x)i + h(QB )a\u03bc (0)(QB )b\u03bd (x)i ,\n8\n\n(16)\n\nIn ref. [15], in the context of a constrained instanton model, the authors propose Ans\u00e4tze\nto account for large-scale vacuum field fluctuations also by matching similarly large and short\ndistances limits of their constrained instanton equation. They also obtain solutions decaying\nexponentially at large distances.\n9\nCrossed terms vanish if the background corresponds to a local minimum of the action i.e.\nto a classical solution.\n\n8\n\n\fExact solution\nOur parametrization\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\u03c6(x)\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nx/\u03c1\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: Comparison between our parametrization of the profile function wit \u03b1DP \u03c1 =\n0.68 and the exact solution of the Diakonov and Petrov equation.\n\nor after Fourier transformation,\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nGlattice (k 2 ) = G(I) (k 2 ) + GQ (k 2 ) .\n\n(17)\n\nThe working hypothesis we derive from the interpretation of fig. 1, is that in\na certain region of momenta, say below \u223c 1 GeV, quantum effects are strongly\nsuppressed and only classical properties are seen. Of course, we introduce this\nhypothesis based on a phenomenological observation, but it is not unconceivable\nthat an intrinsically non-perturbative phenomenon like confinement could cause\nthe disappearance of quantum correlations at distances larger than the confining\nscale.\n\n4.1\n\nEstimated corrections to the instanton liquid model\n\nFrom our data we have been led to fit the bare Green functions to the r.h.s of\neq. (3) in a range kmin < k < kmax without any correction. It is far from obvious\nthat we can neglect either quantum corrections or lattice truncations of the quasiclassical model. This subsection is devoted to justify our choice. For the sake of\nclarity, we will pay the price of anticipating on the results of some fits which will\nbe later detailed.\n(i) The Green functions G(n) estimated from three different lattice spacings\nmatch reasonably to each other, after a mere rescaling to a common value for\n9\n\n\f4\n\n30\n\nDPm\n2\n\u03b2=5.6 (24 )\n\nDPm (global)\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03b2=5.6 (24 )\n\n2\n\n\u03b2=5.7 (32 )\n\n2\n\nn(5.6)/n(\u03b2) k Gb (k ,\u03b2 )\n\n\u03b2=5.8 (24 )\nBPST\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03b2=5.8 (24 )\nDPm (best fit)\n\n(3)\n\n20\n\n2\n\n6\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nn(5.6)/n(\u03b2) k Gb (k ,\u03b2 )\n\n\u03b2=5.7 (32 )\n\n3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n0.5\n\n0\n0,5\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\nk (GeV)\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\nk (GeV)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: (a) We plot the gluon propagator, k2 G(2) , for the three lattices after a\nrescaling that matches data from \u03b2 = 5.7 and \u03b2 = 5.8 to those from \u03b2 = 5.6. The dotted\nline is obtained from the BPST profile with \u03c1 = 0.3 fm and the solid line is the best fit\nusing our profile parameterization for the gluon propagator. BPST cannot manifestly\ndescribe lattice data. (b) The points are lattice evaluations of symmetric vertex, k6 G(3) .\nThe solid line is the best fit for the vertex with our profile parameterization, the density\nbeing required to be the same for both propagator and vertex, and the dotted is the best\nfit with a free density in the fitting.\n\nsome kmax of the order of 1 GeV (see Fig. 3). These matching coefficients are\nclose to 1, approximately in the ratios 0.95 / 1.0/ 1.05 for \u03b2 = 5.6, 5.7, 5.8.\n(ii) It is difficult to know precisely which mechanism drives these matching\ncoefficients slightly away from 1: quantum corrections, ultraviolet/infrared\ncutoffs on quasi-classical solutions. It is also impossible to know if these corrections are multiplicative, additive or of a more complex nature. The main\nlesson is that these corrections are small, and we decide for convenience to\ndescribe them by a multiplicative rescaling factor.\n(iii) This factor is defined as\n(m)\n\n\u0393(m) (k 2 , a\u22121 ) =\n\nGlattice (k 2 , a\u22121 )\n(m)\n\nG(I) (k 2 )\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere a\u22121 is the regularization scale i.e. the inverse lattice spacing and\n(m)\nG(I) (k 2 ), m = 2, 3 are given in eq. (3). The functions \u0393(m) (k 2 , a\u22121 ) n \u03b2/6 10 ,\nn being the instanton density, are plotted up to an unknown global constant\n(2)\nin fig. 4(a). G(I) (k 2 ) is here the best fit to be discussed later. These plots\nshow the good matching of different lattice spacings after performing a\n10\n\nThe factor \u03b2/6 \u2261 1/g 2 comes from the factor g 2 in eq. (3).\n\n10\n\n\fconstant multiplicative rescaling (fig 4(b) shows the result of this rescaling).\nThey show a wide parabola having its minimum around k = 0.65 GeV, this\nminimum is around 7 to 8 which corresponds to the order of magnitude of\nthe instanton density we will derive (the other factors being close to 1).\nOne possible explanation of this parabolic behaviour is an expected increase\nof quantum corrections towards larger k and, towards lower k, a relative\nincrease of the ratio due to the fast decrease of the denominator in eq. (18):\nfor example the fast increase at low k might be due to additive quantum\ncorrections which are only visible when the quasi-classical background is\nvery small. Additive corrections are anyhow necessary at k = 0 since the\nlattice data are non vanishing while the denominator of eq. (18) is zero.\nWhether this non vanishing of the lattice propagator at k = 0 is a finite\nvolume effect violating Zwanziger's theorem [17], will not be discussed in\nthis paper since, as already mentioned, we restrain from discussing the\nfinite-volume sensitive region below \u223c 0.4 GeV.\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n8\n\n7\n\n7\n6\n\n0,4\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n1\n\n0,4\n\n(a)\n\n0,5\n\n0,7\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n0,9\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: (a) We plot the ratios n \u0393(2) (k2 , a\u22122 )\u03b2/6 where n is the instanton density\nand \u0393(2) defined in eq. (18), for the three lattices, the squares, triangles and circles\ncorresponding respectiveley to \u03b2 = 5.8, \u03b2 = 5.7 and \u03b2 = 5.6. The horizontal axis\nrepresents the momentum in GeV. (b) The same points as in (a) but with the multiplicative rescaling performed. Different \u03b2 \u2032 s coincide quite well, all show a parabolic\ntype dependence in k.\n\n(iv) If we stick to the momentum range plotted in fig. 4(b) these ratios do not\ndeviate from a constant by more than a few percent. We will therefore perform our fits only in this range kmin \u2212 kmax 11 and approximate \u0393(2) (k 2 , a\u22121 )\n11\n\nTo be precise our fits use the window kmin = 0.44 and kmax = 0.89.\n\n11\n\n\fby a constant:\n\u0393(2) (k 2 , a\u22121 )\n\n\u223c\n\u0393(2) (a\u22121 ) ,\n2 < 2< 2\nkmin\n\u223ck \u223ckmax\n\n(19)\n\n(v) Since from fig. 4(a) the different \u0393(2) (a\u22121 ) differ also by no more than a\nfew percent we decide to take from now on all these \u0393(2) (a\u22121 )'s as equal at\nthe cost of an expected discrepancy between the fitted densities of a few\npercent. We take\n\u0001\n\u2200a\u22121 , \u0393(2) (a\u22121 ) = \u0393(2) a\u22121 (5.6) .\n(20)\nwhere a\u22121 (5.6) is the inverse lattice spacing for \u03b2 = 5.6.\n\n(vi) We now wonder if the hypothesis eq.(20) can be extended to the coefficients\n\u0393(3) (a\u22121 ). The small dependence on k and on a\u22121 can be seen, although\nwith larger errors, in fig. 3(b) where the different lattice data seem to fit\none common solid curve representing the model. The next question is the\nvalidity of the hypothesis\n\u0393(3) (a\u22121 ) = \u0393(2) (a\u22121 ).\n\n(21)\n\nTo test the hypothesis \u0393(3) \u223c \u0393(2) we can look at fig. 5. The vertical\naxis corresponds to the ratio \u0393(3) (a\u22121 (5.6)/\u0393(2) (a\u22121 (5.6)) or equivalently\nto n(3) /n(2) where we define n(m) \u2261 n\u0393(m) (a\u22121 (5.6)), n being the instanton\ndensity. The horizontal axis corresponds to the instanton radius \u03c1, supposed\nto be the same for all instantons. For that instanton radius a best fit of the\nbare Green functions is performed according to the formula:\n(m)\n\n(m)\n\nGlattice (k 2 , a\u22121 ) = G(I) (k 2 ) \u0393(m) (a\u22121 (5.6))\n\n(22)\n\n(m)\n\nwith G(I) (k 2 ) given by eq. (3). The plot 5 shows for each \u03c1 an agreement between different \u03b2's which is a surprise: it tells that the ratio\n\u0393(3) (a\u22121 )/\u0393(2) (a\u22121 ) is almost independent of the lattice spacing even though\nit does strongly depend on \u03c1. The dotted curve shows the \u03c72 of the\ncommon fit to G(2) and G(3) . The smallest \u03c72 corresponds to a ratio\n\u0393(3) (a\u22121 )/\u0393(2) (a\u22121 ) ranging from 0.8 to 0.9, i.e. close to 1. This also corresponds to a value of the radius around 0.3 fm which is the one favored by\nphenomenology. This leads us to consider eq. (21) as quite reasonable.\n(vii) All the arguments up to now have shown an approximate equality to a few\npercent of all \u0393(m) (a\u22121 )'s. We are left with an unknown global constant.\nThe fact that these factors are so close to each other suggests that the\ncorrections to the instantonic contribution (whatever their origin may be)\n12\n\n\fare small. It is then natural to expect that these correction factors are also\nclose to 1. This is confirmed by a result which will be detailed at the end of\nthis paper via the following argument: if we initially take \u0393(2,3) 6= 1, apply\nMOM renormalisation and then eq. (1), we obtain:\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u00012\n(3)\n2 \u22121\n6 GLatt (k , aLatt )\n\u0393(3) (a\u22121\n)\nk\nLatt\n(23)\n\u03b1Latt (k) =\n\u0010\n\u00013 \u03b1(I) (k)\n\u00113 =\n\u22121\n(2)\n4\u03c0\n(2)\n\u22121\n\u0393\n(a\n)\n2\nGLatt (k , aLatt )\n|\n{zLatt }\nwhere the term above the curly bracket in the r.h.s. introduces a supposedto-be-sub-leading correction, depending on the regularization parameter,\nthat we neglect in our analysis for the present work (and did the same\nin [8]). Let us anticipate some of our next results: the reasonable agreement\nbetween the instanton density obtained from the coupling constant \u03b1Latt (k)\nin table 3 with the one in table 1 implies a ratio (\u0393(3) )2 /(\u0393(2) )3 close to\n1. The latter, combined with \u0393(2) /\u0393(3) \u223c 1 presented in the preceding\nitem, ends up with an approximate justification of our hypothesis that all\n\u0393(n) (a\u22121 ), n = 2, 3 \u223c 1 for all \u03b2's in the range considered here.\n\nThus, our final working hypothesis is:\n\u0393(m) (k 2 , a\u22121 ) = 1 for m = 2, 3 and kmin < k < kmax .\n\n(24)\n\nwith kmin = 0.44 GeV and kmax = 0.89 GeV.\n\n4.2\n\nNumerical results.\n\nThe numerical data that we shall exploit systematicaly all over the paper result\nfrom two simulations on a 244 lattice with bare coupling constants given by\n\u03b2 = 5.6 and \u03b2 = 5.8, and a simulation on a 324 lattice for \u03b2 = 5.712 , in the\nLandau gauge. The gluon correlations functions are obtained from only 20 field\nconfigurations, that are enough to manifest the classical background effects we\nsearch for. However, more field configurations are available for some of the lattices\nand we used them to check that those exploited are not particularly biased13 . We\ncalibrate all these simulations with the ratios of lattice spacings for different \u03b2's\ngiven in ref. [18] and a\u22121\nLatt (\u03b2 = 6.0) = 1.97 GeV (this last value was used in\nref. [19] consistently with the very precise measurement of the lattice spacing\nresulting from a non-perturbatively improved action in ref. [20]).\nCoefficients in [18] are fitted for \u03b2 = 6/g 2 \u2265 6. In this work, we make use\nof rather low values \u03b2 < 6.0, in order to have larger volumes. These low values\n12\n\nWith the two lattices for \u03b2 = 5.6, 5.7 we simulate practically the same physical volume and\nare thus in position to check lattice spacing artifacts.\n13\nOur Jacknife errors estimate also the dependence on the set of configurations.\n\n13\n\n\f(2)\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\u03c7 /d.o.f.\n\nn /n\n\n2\n\u03b2=5.6\n\u03b2=5.7\n\u03b2=5.8\n\n10\n\n1,5\n\n1\n5\n\n0,5\n\n2\n\nglobal \u03c7 /d.o.f.\n0\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n\u03c1 (fm)\n\n0,4\n\n0\n0,5\n\nFigure 5: We plot the ratios n(3) /n(2) where we define n(m) \u2261 n\u0393(m) (a\u22121 (5.6), n being\nthe instanton density.

The two- and threepoint Green functions are fitted simultaneously with the some instanton density. Note\nthat the stated errors are only statistical.\n\nWe collect the results of our fits for several fixed instanton radii in tab. 1. An\ninstanton density, although the same for both Green functions 14 , is independently\n14\nNotice the difference with the fits presented in fig. 5 where different densities are assumed\nfor G(2) and G(3) .\n\n14\n\n\ffitted for each particular lattice spacing. We look thus for a remnant of a subleading dependence on the regularization parameter. The careful reader may\nhave noticed that the relative density splitting between different \u03b2's is slightly\nsmaller (3 % for \u03b4\u03b2 = 0.1) than the splitting between the linear fits in fig. 4 (4.5\n%). This is due the factor g 2 in eq. (3) (about 1.5 %).\nCrudeness of our quasi-classical approximation.\nIt is worth to insist that our fit rely on the crude approximation given by eq.\n(24) which is not valid beyond a few percents as discussed at length in subsection\n4.1. This is the origin of the difference between the densities in tab. 1. This\nis also the reason why the minimal \u03c72 /d.o.f. in table 1 is of the order of two\nbecause we force the overall factor to be the same in fits for both two- and threepoint Green functions. This tells about the crudeness of completely neglecting\nthe sub-leading contributions from quantum fluctuations and lattice truncation\nof the classical solutions. Much better matchings might have been obtained had\nwe relaxed the constraint eq. (24). We refrained from doing so because it would\nhave needed additional input about quantum fluctuations and lattice truncation\nof classical solutions which would have been mere guesses and would not have\nyielded any stronger evidence.\nAt the present stage of the work, the best we can do is to assume eq. (24) and\nget what we believe to be a fairly coherent description of our whole set of lattice\ndata. The best-fit parameterization in Tab. 1 is the best we can achieve, and\nit is not that bad, although we know that the density obtained there is affected\nroughly by a 20% of systematic uncertainty15 .\n\n4.3\n\nQCD versus pure gluon-dynamics\n\nOur measured densities in tab. 2, while in the ballpark of lattice estimations,\ngive a contribution to the gluon condensate g 2 Ga\u03bc\u03bd 2 \u223c 4GeV4 \u223c (1400 MeV)4\nfor n \u223c 8 fm\u22124 , significantly larger than other estimates, based on QCD sum\nrules [30], g 2Ga\u03bc\u03bd 2 \u223c 0.5 GeV4 \u223c (840MeV)4 , or more recently [31], g 2 Ga\u03bc\u03bd 2 \u223c\n0.9GeV4 \u223c (970MeV)4 . A significant difference between the pure Yang-Mills condensate and the one from QCD sum rules is however expected: in ref. [32] (see\neq. (106) ) it is argued that light dynamical quarks might reduce the G2 condensate by a factor 2 to 3. In fact, it can be argued that the low eigenvalues of the\nfermion determinant reduce the instanton contribution from the action and hence\nthe resulting instanton density. In addition, some re-shaping of instanton profiles\nfor a strongly correlated vacuum populated by fermions cannot be discarded. As\na result, estimates in pure gluon-dynamics should differ substantially from those\n15\n\nThis uncertainty is estimated from the n(3) /n(2) ratio at the minimum \u03c72 in fig. 5, ranging\naround 0.8\u20130.9 instead of 1.\n\n15\n\n\fin QCD and only the analysis of unquenched (Nf 6= 0) lattices simulations of\ngauge fields could help us to quantify this discrepancy.\nNot only the same analysis of this paper for unquenched simulations could\nquantify the discrepancy, but we may also appeal to the connection of A2 condensate and the ILM approach: the gluon condensate of dimension two can\nbe computed by extracting the momentum power OPE correction to the perturbative formula of Landau-gauge Green functions from their lattice estimates\nabove \u223c 2.6 GeV (see discusion in section 2) [12]. This condensate is to be\ncomputed at a given renormalization point, \u03bc0 , lying on the momentun range of\nOPE-dominance.\nNow, if we run the renormalization point \u03bc0 of the A2 -condensate down to\nsome instanton scale, \u03bcI , with the help of the one-loop renormalisation goup\nequations (RGE), we obtain [14]:\n\nhA2inst i\n\n2\n\n\u2261 12\u03c0\u03c1 n \u2243\n\nhA2R,\u03bcI i\n\n\u2243\n\nhA2R,\u03bc0 i\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n35 ln (\u03bcI /\u03bc0 )\n;\n1+\n44 ln (\u03bc0 /\u039bQCD )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we match the OPE+RGE estimate to an ILM semiclassical one. Of course,\nthe latter is a purely semiclassical estimate deprived of the UV-fluctuations\naround the classical minima which we assume to be subleading at the appropriated instanton scales (see again the discussion in section 2). Thus, the instanton\ndensity can be roughly estimated from the dimension-two gluon-condensate.\nAlthough the gluon condensate for quenched simulations has been largely\nstudied [12] in literature, unfortunatly only a very preliminar analysis of the\nMOM QCD coupling constant from a lattice simulation with two dynamical-quark\nflavours is available [13]. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for such high\nquark masses that no effect of instanton suppression is to be expected and indeed\nno significant effect has yet been seen. Progress in the unquenched determination\nof the gluon condensate will be, of course, welcome.\nMoreover, the QCD sum rules are not so accurate and neither are our density estimates which, for instance, would be modified by the presence of other\n\"instanton-like structures\" or instantons deformations.\nAltogether our density estimate is close to the maximum acceptable: with a\ndensity of 8 per fm4 the average distance between two neighbouring instanton\ncenters is of the order of 0.6 fm i.e. twice the average radius, a really dense\npacking.\n\n5\n\nThe effect of the instanton radius dispersion\n\nWe have performed satisfactory and independent fits for the three different lattices from \u03b1s to the k 4 -formula, eqs. (5, 6), and obtain the estimates for the\ninstanton density shown in the second column of Tab. 2. They differ by about a\n16\n\n\f30 % from the profile dependent ones obtained from G(m) and presented in table\n1. The fit of \u03b1s is done on a rather firm ground since, contrarily to the fits of\nG(m) , the prediction does not at all depend on the profile neither on the radius\nbut only on eq.(6), of course on the hypothesis that the radius distribution is a\ndelta function i.e. that all the radii are equal. \u03b1s is therefore the best quantity\nto estimate the corrections to this rather drastic hypothesis. If the k 4 law does\nnot depend on the instanton profiles but only on the \u03b4-function distribution, the\ncorrections do 16 .\nFirst, we face the problem of computing the corrections to the previous \u03b4function result from a more general optics: we just consider some small width for\nthe distribution, \u03b4\u03c1, and compute in perturbations of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 around the average\nradius, \u03c1. We can write:\n< \u03c13m I m (k\u03c1) > = I m (k\u03c1) < \u03c13m > +\n+\n\nd m\nI (k\u03c1) < \u03c13m (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1) >\nd\u03c1\n\n1 d2 m\nI (k\u03c1) < \u03c13m (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1)2 > + . . . .\n2 d\u03c12\n\n(26)\n\nwe take \u03c1 = \u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1 , assume the distribution to be symmetric (at least for small\nperturbations) around the peak, i.e. < \u03b4\u03c1 >= 0 and then obtain:\n\u0012\n\u0012 4 \u0013\u0013\nn(n \u2212 1) \u03b4\u03c12\n\u03b4\u03c1\n< (\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1) > = \u03c1 1 +\n,\n2 +O\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c14\n\u0012 4\u0013\n2\n\u03b4\u03c1\nn\nn+1 \u03b4\u03c1\n< (\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1) \u03b4\u03c1 > = n\u03c1\n,\n2 +O\n\u03c1\n\u03c14\n\u0012 4\u0013\n2\n\u03b4\u03c1\nn\n2\nn+2 \u03b4\u03c1\n.\n< (\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1) \u03b4\u03c1 > = \u03c1\n2 +O\n\u03c1\n\u03c14\nn\n\nn\n\n(27)\n\nThus, we derive for the QCD MOM coupling constant defined in eq.

The same is obtained\nby applying the DP-inspired profile parametrization defined in eq. (13) (where\nwe take \u03b1\u03c1 = 0.68 from the previous section) to eq. (29) and, as can be seen\nin plot 6, the functions f obtained from both profiles evolve rather close to each\nother for all k\u03c1. This suggests a pattern that eq. (28) obeys in rather general\nmanner17 : the k 4 -power law is corrected by a positive k\u03c1-independent term and\nby a negative one depending on k\u03c1; the first one gives some pre-factor larger than\n1 to the k 4 formula and the second can be numerically simulated rather well over\nthe window (0.4 \u2212 0.9) GeV by reducing18 the power on k,\n\u03b1(k) \u2243\n\nc\n4\u2212\u03b5\n.\n4 (k\u03c1)\n18\u03c0n\u03c1\n\n(31)\n\nThis last result, eq. (31), altogether with the constraints c > 1 and \u03b5 > 0, are\nthe main and more general result of the section. The values of \u03b5 and c depend\non the particular profile and on the width of the radii distribution, as given by\neqs. (28,29) in the small width limit.\nWe will now proceed as follows. We will first estimate the parameter \u03b5 by\nfitting our lattice data for MOM QCD coupling constant to the formula eq. (31),\nwhere n/c is to be taken as a free parameter to be tuned. Then, we will estimate\nthe width and the instanton density, n, with the help of eqs. (28,29), i.e. in the\nsmall width approximation. Finally, the consequences of employing more realistic\nradii distributions will be preliminarily discussed, details being in appendix B.\nLattice results\nIn this subsection, we first collected in tab. 2 the results for the density obtained\nthrough the fit of the MOM QCD coupling constant defined in eq. (1) to the\nk 4 -power law in eqs. (5,6), for our three lattice data set.\nThen, we include in tab. 3 the results for the best fits of the same QCD coupling\nconstant lattice data to the power law formula of eq. (31).\nWe use for both the same fitting window, 0.44 < k < 0.89, used in section 4\nto obtain the best profile parameterization. The \u03c72 /d.o.f.'s in tab. 3 are tiny.\n17\n\nsee appendix A.\nIt is in fact a matter of power reduction because k\u03c1 > 1 in the most and more numerically\nrelevant part of the fitting interval, for \u03c1 = 1.5 GeV\u22121 .\n18\n\n18\n\n\f\u03c1f(k\u03c1)\n\n0\nDPm\nBPST\n\n-0,5\n\n-1\n\n-1,5\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nk\u03c1\n\nFigure 6: The function \u03c1f (k\u03c1) defined in the text in terms of k\u03c1 for both DP-inspired\nand BPST profiles.\n\nLattice\n5.6(244)\n5.7(324)\n5.8(324)\n\nn (fm\u22124 )\n5.2(6)\n6.7(4)\n6(1)\n\nTable 2: Results for the density obtained from fitting lattice coupling constant to eqs.\n(5,6) i.e. assuming a k4 behavior.

A global fit for the whole set seems thus to\nbe appropriate. The resulting power deduced from a global fit is:\n3.91 \u00b1 0.45 ,\n19\n\n(32)\n\nStill, our jackknife estimate of the statistical error is reliable because, if the global average\nfor the different momenta are correlated, the averages for different sets of gauge configurations\nare not.\n20\nAs expected since we found the sub-leading lattice-spacing dependent corrections to be\nsmall in eq.

The fitted powers are then lower than 4 but the errors\nshow that the power 4 is not excluded by our fits.\n\nwhich is compatible with both the general constraint \u03b5 > 0 and also with a k 4 -power\nlaw. The \u03c72 /d.o.f. is 0.39 for this global fit. In ref. [8], the same global fit was\nperformed using also a few other lattices (we added estimates of \u03b1s over smaller\nvolumes and larger \u03b2's: 5.7(244 ), 5.9(244), 6.0(244,164 ); these, having only one\npoint inside the fitting window, have been discarded from the present work. The\nresult of the latter analysis was 3.82(8) for the fitted power. The error was there\nclearly underestimated21 but the evaluations of the coupling constant from larger\n\u03b2's do not practically affect the central value. This fact indicates that exploiting\nthe small \u03b2's used in the present work does not seem to introduce any sizable\nbias, at least over the low-momentum region, on the determination of \u03b1s .\nInstanton density in the small width approximation\nThe global fit for the whole set of lattice data yields \u03b5 \u2243 0.1 for the central\nvalue estimate of that parameter. If we apply the exact result for f in eq. (29)\nto eq. (28) and use the latter to estimate \u03b4\u03c1 through its best numerical matching\nto the power formula eq. (31) with \u03b5 = 0.1, we will obtain:\n\u03b4\u03c12\n\u2243 0.01 .\n\u03c12\n\n(33)\n\nThis results implies that\n\nc \u2243 1 + 12\n\n\u03b4\u03c12\n\u2243 1.12 .\n\u03c12\n\n(34)\n\nThus, densities obtained from tab. 3 will be about 10 % larger than those in tab.\n2 because of the factor c in front of the power of k. If we compute numerically the\nfunction f for the DP-inspired profile and follow the same procedure to estimate\nthe width, the parameter c and hence the corrections to the instanton density\n21\n\nWe used the criterium of assuming one standard deviation as \u03c72 = \u03c72min + 1, which is biased\nby the strong correlations between data for different momenta as just discussed.\n\n20\n\n\festimates from the k 4 -law in tab. 2, we will obtain roughly the same results. This\ncould be expected after checking the rather similar behaviours of the function f\nobtained from both profiles in plot 6. This means consequently that, once some\nsmall width distribution is assumed and practically not regarding to the profile,\nthe estimated instanton density is n \u223c 6 \u2212 8 fm\u22124 .\nAll these estimates are anyhow in the right ballpark as far as different arguments [16] seem to point towards an instanton density of a few fm\u22124 's.\nDiscussing about realistic distributions.\nAfter estimating the effects of a small width distribution, we will discuss the\nconsequences of some instanton distributions proposed in the literature.\nIt is well known that the one-loop tunneling amplitude of classical minima\nin gauge theories gives the standard growth \u03bc(\u03c1) \u223c \u03c16 for instanton radii distribution [2]. The classical interaction of instantons in the background is thought\nto introduce small-distance repulsion that strongly suppress large instantons and\nleads to a well-behaved partition function [5]. Applying the Feynman variational\nprinciple to a liquid of BPST instantons, Diakonov & Petrov found indeed that\nthis infrared growth is balanced as follows [4]:\n\n\u03bc(\u03c1) = 2\n\n\u0010\n\n2 2\n\u03c1\n7\n\n\u0011\u22127/2\n\n\u03b3(7/2)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n7\u03c12\n\u03c1 exp \u2212\n,\n2\u03c12\n6\n\n(35)\n\nR\u221e\nR\u221e\nwhere \u03c12 = 0 d\u03c1\u03c12 \u03bc(\u03c1) and \u03b3(n) = 0 dte\u2212t tn\u22121 is the standar Euler's gamma\nfunction and\n\u0010 \u00112\n\u03c12\n=\n\n7\n2n\u03b302 \u03b2(\u03c1)\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nA very important remark is that eqs. (8), particularized for BPST profile22 and\nusing \u03b2(\u03c1) \u2243 \u03b2(\u03c1), combined with eq. (36), leads to avoid the dependence on the\ndensity and to derive a prediction for the previously fitted parameter \u03b1DP \u03c1,\ns\nq\n14\n\u2243 0.6\n\u03b1DP \u03c12 =\n3\u03b2(\u03c1)\n\n(37)\n\nwhere we use \u03b2(\u03c1) \u2243 15 as in [4]. The agreement of such a prediction with our\nlattice estimate is remarkably encouraging since, for our non-BPST profile, this\nrelation has been numerically checked and remain approximately valid.\nThe goal of this section is anyhow to analyze the impact of the corrections\nto the equal radii approximation that we use to describe the low momentum\n22\n\nIn the BPST limit eq. (8) becomes eq. (10) where\n\n21\n\nR\n\ndx2 \u03c62 = \u03c12 .\n\n\fbehaviour of our lattice Green functions. For this purpose, we remark that the\ndistribution given by\nq eq.

This is why we compute in appendix B the\nGreen functions and the MOM QCD coupling constant on the background of an\ninstanton liquid with radii distribution given by eq. (35) and fit the latter to the\npower formula given by eq. (31). We do it for BPST and DP-inspired profiles\nand collect the results in tab. 4. As can be learned from the table, the main\nconclusions of the small width analysis remain unchanged except for the fact\nthat the estimate of the density increases up to \u223c 7 \u2212 10 fm\u22124 as a consequence\nof the values of the parameter c.\nProfile\nDPm\nBPST\n\nc\n1.55\n1.52\n\n\u03b5\n0.17\n0.25\n\nTable 4: Values of the parameters c and \u03b5 in eq.

(39): (i)\nthe distribution concerns the radius, \u03c1, of one particular instanton immersed in\nsome \"bath\" of instantons with average radius, \u03c1; how does one combine the two\nscales in the game, \u03c1 and \u03c1, to define the instanton scale for \u03b2 ? Why, for instance,\n22\n\n\fuse \u03b2(\u03c1) instead of \u03b2((\u03c1\u03c1)1/2 ) ? (ii) Such an instanton scale is furthermore of the\norder of 0.3 fm and hence the coupling g in \u03b2 is to be computed out of the\nperturbative regime!\nAny detailed evaluation of the impact of the \"fremon\" distribution implies\nanswering these questions, in particular knowing the behaviour on \u03c1 of \u03b2(\u03c1) and\nhow it modifies the gaussian in eq. (35). However, this is out of the scope of\nthe present work. We adopt here a \"phenomenological\" point of view: the DP\nformalism offers a large-distance damping for the profile that properly corrects\nthe low momentum behaviour of Green functions and leads to a satisfactory\ndescription of our lattice data. The large-distance behaviour of the profile is\ngoverned by the parameter \u03b1DP \u03c1 which is rather well estimated when we put\n\u03b2(\u03c1) \u2243 15 in eq. (37) according to [4]. Moreover, had we assumed \u03b2(\u03c1) \u2243 \u03b2(\u03c1)\nand \u0393(\u03c1) \u2243 1 (this is strictely true for the BPST profile) we would recover the\ndistribution in eq. (35).\nAs a final remark, if we try to compute the instanton density through any of\nthe two eqs. (10,36) by employing our best-fit parameters in the previous section, we will obtain \u223c 2 fm\u22124 . Is something still missing in the DP approach?\nAs a matter of fact, the third main aspect criticised by the authors above mentioned [3, 22, 21] is the too strong instanton interaction strength resulting from\nthe DP formalism and it should be noted that a reduction of \u03b302 by a factor three\nor four would allow all the pieces of the puzzle to match. Thus, our analysis\ndetects somehow this effect pointed out in the above references regarding the\ninstanton-antiinstanton interaction. It remains to investigate whether our results\nare compatible with those, for instance in [21], where the Stream-line approach\nis used (the author found that \u03b302 is about one order of magnitude smaller than\nthe one from DP).\nWe should recall however our \"phenomenological\" point of view: does the\nsum-ansatz of Diakonov & Petrov, after profile variation, take into account the\neffects included in the Stream-line analysis, except for some effective rescaling of\n\u03b30 ? A preliminar analysis of this question is avanced in appendix C, where we\nshow how one can build the gauge field through the Shuryak's ratio-ansatz [22],\nthat gives an approximative solution to the Stream-line equation, and match the\nsum-ansatz with our DP-inspired instanton profile in both near the center of any\nof the instantons and far from all them. This could explain why the independentpseudoparticle approach given by the sum-ansatz accounts for the low momentum\nbehaviour of the MOM QCD coupling constant and Green functions. This point,\nof course, deserves further attention.\nIn summary, we dedicated this section to analyze the effects of radius dispersion\non the k 4 power-law that the instanton approach predicts for the MOM QCD\ncoupling constant. Within the small width approximation we establish that the\ntwo main effects of radius dispersion appears in our fitting window as a reduction\n\n23\n\n\fof the power of k and as an overall pre-factor larger than 1. In particular, the prefactor does not depend on the particular profile function and corrects the estimate\nof the instanton density from the MOM QCD coupling constant that becomes\nthen compatible with those directly obtained from Green functions in the previous\nsection, \u223c 8 fm\u22124 . In fact, this instanton-density estimate is rather general and,\nas far as the low momentum behaviour of Green functions is dominated by the\ngauge field at large distances, is not only independent of the profile function\nbut neither is affected by the sum-ansatz approach we used. Nothing seems to\nchange by the use of realistic distributions. Futhermore, the analysis of radius\ndispersion in terms of realistic distributions\ngives us the possibility of connecting\nq\nthe \"dynamical\" parameter \u03b1DP \u03c12 with only the instanton coupling throug \u03b2\nand leads to an estimate of \u2243 0.6 for the former, in remarkable agreement with\nour fits.\n\n6\n\nDiscussions and Conclusions\n\nIn a previous paper [8], we had shown a k 4 dependence of the coupling constant\nin MOM scheme, which gave us a rather clean indication of the dominance of\nsemiclassical solutions over low energy QCD dynamics, and some indication that\nthese solutions might be instantons.\nIn order to go further in the understanding of this very remarkable feature,\nwe tried here a direct description of gluon Green functions in this framework. In\norder to achieve this, contrarily to what happens for the MOM coupling constant,\nthe knowledge of the instanton profile is mandatory. The single-instanton BPST\nprofile clearly fails to describe the low momentum behavior since it predicts a divergent gluon propagator for k \u2192 0 in full contradiction with the lattice results.\nThis is understood as an effect of the deformation of instantons far from their\ncenters due to the influence of other instantons. Indeed, the BPST singularity of\nthe gluon propagator is corrected when effects of instanton interactions are taken\ninto account through a parameterization of the profile derived from variational\nmethods [4], and it leads to a successful description of the low momentum behavior of lattice two- and three-point Green functions (see fig. 3). At this point,\nwe cannot exclude other \"instanton-like structures\" as, for example, a significant\namount of merons [9, 10] which would of course modify our density estimates.\nWe fit our lattice data for the Green functions in an instanton liquid model\n(ILM), below energies of \u223c 0.9 GeV, and above \u2243 0.4 GeV. Below \u2243 0.4 GeV we\nhave too few lattice data and furthermore the lattice computed gluon propagator\ngives a non null value for the k \u2192 0 limit, in contradiction with the expectation\nof an ILM:\n(2)\nG(I)\n\n\u223c\n\n\u001a\n\nk \u22122 for BPST\nk 2 for DP\n24\n\n(40)\n\n\fFuthermore, the quantum corrections to the semiclassical solutions should be\nmore visible when the latter vanish 23 . In fact, a signal that instanton approach\ncould be missing some mechanism in the very low momentum regime is the fact\nthat a very recent analysis within the SD approach leads to24\n(2)\n\nGSD \u223c k 2\n\n\u00012\u03ba\u22121\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nwith \u03ba \u2243 0.595 [24]. An also recent SD-motivated work, based on rather general\narguments, points towards \u03ba = 1/2 [25]. Last but not least, this region is expected\nto be strongly finite-volume sensitive and deserves a special study.\nWe have discussed the effect of the instanton radius dispersion. We find a\nsubdominant but non negligible influence of the radius dispersion on the coupling\nconstant: We find that a coherent description of both two- and three-point Green\nfunctions only emerges when the instanton radius reaches the vicinity of 1/3 fm,\nthat is the value derived from phenomenological arguments. Furthermore, after\ninvoking a radius distribution obtained from DP's variational methods[4], we\ncorrect the previously predicted k 4 -power followed by \u03b1s (k) by a slight reduction\nof the power (\u223c k 3.83 ) and a 40 % increase of the prefactor. The fits of all our\nlattice data to a free-power law on k always produces a best-fit exponent lower\nthan 4 but statistically compatible with 4 (We obtain 3.91(45) from a global fit\ncombining all our lattice data sets). This seems to confirm the trend predicted\nfrom radius distribution, but the small number of points in the region of interest\nand the big errors lead to a large uncertainty that prevents us from a more\nconclusive statement. Once this radius dispersion is considered we get a good\nagreement of the density derived directly from a fit of the two- and three-point\nGreen functions and from a fit to \u03b1s (k).\nThe lattice spacings used in this study have been chosen rather large since we\nwished to reach low momenta with a not too large number of lattice points. It\nmight be feared that these values are too far from the continuum limit, too much\nin the strong coupling regime, to be reliable. We did not see any sign of a nonsmooth dependence of any quantity on the lattice spacing. However, for safety,\nit is advisable (and under progress) to follow-on these studies at, say, \u03b2 = 6.0\nwith as large a physical volume as used here. Larger statistics and larger physical\nvolumes at a given lattice spacing are also needed.\nThe lattice gluon propagator at k \u2192 0, has also open problems, for example in relation to the Zwanziger problem [17] and critical exponent in relation\nto instantons. Other theoretical questions are pending such as the reason why\n23\n\nIn ref. [23], the authors discuss about the impact of quantum effects on the large distance\nregime of instanton solutions.\n24\nIt is possible to find in the literature previous estimates for the critical exponenent, \u03ba,\nunder different approximations' schemas as, for instance, \u03ba \u2243 0.92 [26, 27], \u03ba \u2243 0.77 [28] or\n\u03ba = 1 [29].\n\n25\n\n\fquantum fluctuations only play a sub-leading role in this momentum range\n\n25\n\n.\n\nTo briefly conclude, ILM can describe the low-momentum behaviour of gluon\nGreen functions after modelling the instanton profile within the DP approach.\nThree are the parameters playing the game: \u03b1, the instanton radius and density. The first one can be satisfactorily computed within the DP framework, the\nphenomelogical estimate of instanton radius leads to the best fits to lattice data\nand only the fitted density is much higher than its phenomenological estimate\n(although in agreement with another lattice estimates). Such a high instanton\ndensity leads to a large instanton packing fraction that makes hard a simple semiclassical approach to the gluon dynamics. However, instanton density should be\nreduced by including light dynamical quarks and it can not be then excluded that\nthe semiclassical mechanism we use here might give account of the phenomenological value. Our large packing fraction do not rule out a semiclassical approach\nto the full-QCD dynamics.\nStill we believe that we have given a series of rather convincing evidences\nof the influence of instanton-like structures on the low-energy QCD and more\nprecisely on the low-momentum behavior of gluon Green functions.\n\nA\n\nSmall and large momentum regimes of f\n\nThe goal of this appendix is to perform the analysis, based on rather general\ngrounds, of the small and large momentum regimes of the function f defined\nabove in eq. (29). We will assume both regimes to be controlled by the Bessel\nfunction, J2 (k\u03c1z), in the profile integral in that equation.\nFor the small momentum case, the Taylor's series of the Bessel functions\nimplies the following analytical expansion on k\u03c1,\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0001\nzdzJ2 (k\u03c1z)\u03c6(z) \u221d (k\u03c1)2 1 + \u03bbp (k\u03c1)2 + . . . ,\n\n(42)\n\nand we will then obtain\nk4\n\u03b1(k) =\n18\u03c0n\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4\u03c12\n1 + 2\n\u03c1\n\n2 2\n\n4 4\n\n48 + 48\u03bbp k \u03c1 + O k \u03c1\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\n+ O\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4\u03c14\n\u03c14\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n, (43)\n\nwhere, up to that order, only the coefficient \u03bbp keeps the profile function information. That coefficient is furthermore a negative one because of the alternance\nof signs in the Taylor expansion of J2 ,\n25\n\nIf we naively add quantum and classical contributions to the gluon propagator (Eq. (16)),\nthe perturbative quantum contribution would diverge.\n\n26\n\n\fJ2 (x) \u2243\n\nx2 x4\n\u2212\n+ ... ,\n8\n16\n\n(44)\n\nand the correction to the k 4 -power law is hence negative. However, this result\nis only general provided the analyticity for the k\u03c1 expansion in eq. (42) and,\nfor instance, the BPST profile disregards this condition as can be seen by just\nexpanding eq. (30) on k\u03c1,\n\n\u03c1f (k\u03c1) =\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 + 2\u0393E + ln\n8\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nk\u03c1\n2\n\n\u0013\u001b\n\nk 2 \u03c12 + . . . ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhich is clearly non analytical in k\u03c1 = 0. Nevertheless, we show in plot 6 that\nf (k\u03c1) is negative for all k\u03c1 and the correction to the k 4 -power law in eq. (28)\nobeys to the same pattern as the one in eq. (43) with negative \u03bbp . The reason\nfor this behaviour of f can be mainly found in the large momentum limit.\nFor the large momentum case, the oscillating nature of J2 leads the asymptotical behaviour of the profile integral in eq. (42) to be dominated by the condition\n\u03c6(0) = 1 and hence by\nlim\n\na\u21920\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nzdzJ2 (k\u03c1z) e\u2212az =\n0\n\n2\n.\n(k\u03c1)2\n\n(46)\n\nThus, for k\u03c1 >> 1,\nd\n\u03c1f (k\u03c1) = \u03c1 2 ln\nd\u03c1\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n(k\u03c1)2\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u22122 .\n\n(47)\n\n\u03c1=\u03c1\n\nAs can be seen in plot 6, \u03c1f for both BPST and DP-inspired profile joins the\nhorizontal asymptote \u22122 as soon as k\u03c1 \u223c 7.\nOf course, this is not a rigorous proof of that corrections to the k 4 -power\nlaw should be negative for any instanton profile (our fitting window is around\nk\u03c1 \u2243 1), but leads us to reasonably assume that this is the case for most of the\nwell-behaved profiles.\n\nB\n\nSome results for DP distribution of BPST instantons\n\nThis appendix is devoted to present particular results for Green functions and\nfor the MOM QCD coupling constant by employing the distribution for BPST\ninstantons given in eq. (35). We will give results for both BPST and DP-inspired\nprofile functions.\n27\n\n\fThe BPST profile.\nThe use of BPST solution, \u03c6(|x|/\u03c1) = \u03c12 /(x2 +\u03c12 ), implies neglecting the effect\nof neighbouring instanton's classical interaction.

(2) with the instanton profile eq. (13). The role of the coefficient C in\neq. (55) is played by \u03b1DP \u03c1, and the minimization of the action per particle in [22]\nleading to the determination of C is acomplished by eq. (37) resulting from the\nDP variational procedure. Of course, we do not claim that the sum-ansatz with\nthe profile eq. (13) leads to exactly the same results as the ratio-ansatz approach\nbecause the latter would imply that distances other than low and large ones\nhave no influence on the Green functions. However, since the low momentum\nFourier transform of the gauge field is dominated by large distances, at least the\nlow-momentum behaviour of Green functions can be effectively described by the\nindependent-pseudoparticle sum-ansatz approach.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
