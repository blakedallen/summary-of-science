Phys. G: Nucl. Phys.\n\n1. Introduction\nA useful probe of the dense nuclear matter created in collisions of heavy nuclei\nat the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) is one that is sensitive to dynamical\nscales and can be both cleanly measured experimentally and reliably calculated\ntheoretically [1]. Because of color confinement, only hard probes, i.e. those with\nlarge momentum transfers, can be reliably calculated in the perturbation theory of\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Experimental measurements of inclusive particle\nsuppression are now able to test jet quenching theory out to transverse momenta as\nlarge as pT \u223c 20 GeV [2]. On the other hand, typical dynamical scales of the nuclear\nmatter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions are on the order of hundreds of\nMeV, which is both much smaller than the scale of a hard probe and non-perturbative.\nTherefore, an ideal probe should be not only \"hard\" but also sensitive to this \"soft\"\nphysics. Open charm production has a potential to satisfy these criteria because of the\n\u00a7 E-mail address: ivitev@lanl.gov\n\n\f2\ntwo distinctive scales of the open charm meson: the charm quark mass, mc \u223c 1.5 GeV,\na relatively hard scale, and the binding energy, \u223c MD \u2212 mc \u223c hundreds MeV, which\nmay be relevant to the fragmentation and dissociation of D mesons.\nWith this in mind, we present a baseline study of heavy quark production and the\nfirst results on heavy-quark-triggered large-angle correlations in elementary nucleonnucleon reactions [1]. Next, we investigate the many-body QCD effects in singleand double-inclusive open charm production. Because of the quantitative importance\nof multiple scattering for inferring properties of the nuclear matter, the models of\nin-medium interactions should be subjected to experimental verification for heavyflavor production. One may begin to gain confidence by applying the theoretical\ndescription of such effects to heavy ion collisions in simpler situations, such as protonnucleus (p+A) scattering. In this case, plasma properties are not an issue and the\nmain medium effect is, therefore, due to the multiple interactions in cold nuclei. The\nmedium effects that we plan to investigate are also present in nucleus-nucleus (A+A)\nreactions during the interaction time \u03c4int. = 2RA /\u03b3 \u226a \u03c4eq. \u226a \u03c4QGP and cannot be\nneglected. Here RA is the nuclear radius, \u03b3 is the Lorentz gamma factor of the nucleus,\n\u03c4eq. is the equilibration time and \u03c4QGP is the lifetime of the plasma.\nWe note that full technical details for the results presented in these proceedings\nare given in our complete manuscript [1].\n2. D meson production and correlations in lowest order PQCD\nA formal expansion for the differential cross section of heavy quark production can be\nwritten as follows:\n\u221e\nX\n\u0001\nd\u03c3\n2\n3\n2\nai (\u03b1s ln \u03bc/m)i\n=\n\u03b1\nA(m,\np\n)\n+\n\u03b1\nB(m,\np\n)\n+\n*\n*\n*\n+\n\u03b1\nT\nT\ns\ns\ns\ndyd2 pT\ni=2\n!\n\u221e\nX\nbi (\u03b1s ln \u03bc/m)i + * * * G(m, pT ) + * * * ,\n(1)\n+\u03b13s\ni=1\n\nwhere G(m, pT ) \u2192 1 when m/pT \u2192 0, and power suppressed terms \u223c (m/pT )n are\nnot shown. In Eq. (1) A, B, ai , bi are coefficient functions and logarithms arise due\nto the new mass scale, m. These are known to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), but\nnumerically, their contribution to the cross section is small up to pT \u223c 50 GeV [3].\nExisting calculations of charm and bottom production [3] treat quarks as heavy,\nassuming \u03c6c,b/N (x, \u03bcf ) \u2261 0. We here evaluate the differential cross sections for\nopen charm production and open-charm-triggered di-hadron correlations in the Born\napproximation. We include the charm contribution from the nucleon wave-function\nexplicitly [1], since this approach leads to a faster convergence of the perturbation\nseries [4] and correspondingly smaller next-to-leading (NLO) order K-factors.\nThere is a direct relation between the absolute normalization of the cross section\nand the hardness of the non-perturbative D meson fragmentation. We compare in the\n0\n+\nleft\n\u221a panel of Fig. 1 the calculated D and D cross sections to the Tevatron Run II\ns = 1.96 TeV data [5]. We find that three different combinations (KN LO = 1.5,\nr = 0.1), (KN LO = 2, r = 0.2) and (KN LO = 3, r = 0.4) yield little difference in\nthe single inclusive charm meson spectrum. We note that for the same choice of the\nfragmentation parameter r = 0.1, a LO calculation with standard \u03c6c/N (x, \u03bcf ) 6= 0\ngives open charm cross sections similar to the ones from a NLO calculation that treats\nflavor as \"heavy\".\n\n\f3\n2.5\nD trigger\n\n4\n\n/ d\u03c3\n\nAnti-D meson\n\n/ d\u03c3\n\nmc = 1.3 GeV\n2\n\n10\n\nTevatron II\n= 1.96 TeV\n\nd\u03c3\n\ns\n\n1/2\n\n2\n\n+\n\nr = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4\n\n1\n\nLight h\n\n, d\u03c3\n\n3\n\n10\n\n-\n\n0\n\nD +D (c)\n\n1.5\n\ntotal\n\n-1\n\nd\u03c3/dpT1 [nb.GeV ]\n\n0\n\nD\n+\nD\nr = 0.1, KNLO = 1.5\nr = 0.2, KNLO = 2.0\nr = 0.4, KNLO = 3.0\n\n+\n\nh +h (q,g)\n\n1000\n\nD(z)\n\ntotal\n\n10\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nz\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ntotal\n\nd\u03c3\n\n1\n1/2\n\ns\n\n0.5\n\ny1 = y2 = 0\n\nAnti-D mesons\n\npT1 = 5 GeV\n\n|y| < 1\n\n= 200 GeV\n\nLight hadrons\n\n1\n\n10 5\n\n10\n\n15\npT1 [GeV]\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\npT2 [GeV]\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFigure 1. Left panel from [1]: cross section\nfor D 0 and D + charm meson\n\u221a\nproduction to LO in perturbative QCD at s = 1.96 TeV. Data is from CDF [5].\nRight panel from [1]: contribution of light hadrons and anticharm mesons to the\nfractional production cross section for pT1 = 5 GeV D 0 + D + meson-triggered\naway-side correlations for y1 = y2 = 0. The insert illustrates the difference in the\nfragmentation of light quarks and gluons into hadrons versus that for the c quark\ninto charm mesons.\n\nBesides the inclusive spectra, we show our first results on charm meson-triggered\naway-side di-hadrons. The expectation for non-trivial pT2 dependence of such largeangle correlations is based on the very different behavior with respect to z =\nphadron /pparton of the fragmentation functions of partons into light hadrons compared\nto those of heavy quarks into charm and beauty meson [1]. The insert in the right\npanel of Fig. 1 shows that while light hadrons favor soft decays of their parent partons,\nheavy quark fragmentation is very hard. For z \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.9 there is more than an order\nof magnitude\nP enhancement in the decay probabilities DD0 /c (z) + DD+ /c (z) relative\nto (1/N ) i=1,N (D\u03c0\u00b1 /i + DK \u00b1 /i + Dp(p\u0304)/i ), where i runs over the light and charm\nquarks, antiquarks and the gluon.\nTriggering on a D meson fixes the momentum of the charm quark much more\nreliably than does triggering on a light hadron [6] in studying away-side correlations.\nThe non-perturbative fragmentation, therefore, controls the yields of di-hadrons versus\nthe associated momentum pT2 and the abundances of the different particle species.\nThe right panel of Fig. 1 shows our prediction for the hadronic composition of the\nD0 + D+ -triggered away-side jet. At transverse momenta significantly smaller than\nthe trigger transverse momentum, pT2 \u226a pT1 , the away-side jet is dominated by pions,\nkaons and protons. At transverse momenta pT1 \u2243 pT2 , the away-side jet is expected to\nbe dominated almost completely by D\u03040 and D\u2212 mesons. Since there is little sensitivity\nto the choice of r, our prediction is robust and can be used as a test of the production\nmechanism of heavy quarks.\n3. Resummed QCD power corrections to open charm production\nIn the case of hadronic collisions there is indeed similarity with the DIS dynamics in\nthe final-state rescattering of the struck, small xb , parton from the nucleus, as shown\nin the left panel of Fig. 2. Such nuclear-enhanced power corrections are equivalent\n\n\f4\nto dynamical mass for the interacting quark, similar to the generation of dynamical\nelectron mass in a strong magnetic field,\n1\n3\u03c0\u03b1s\nlim xG(x) .\n(2)\nm2dyn = \u03be 2 A1/3 = A1/3\n8 r02 x\u21920 2\nThey lead to suppression of the single- and double-inclusive hadron production cross\nsections in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) [7] and forward rapidity p+A reactions [6],\nas long as the minimum coherence criterion x < 0.1 is satisfied.\nThe mechanism behind the reduction of the deep inelastic inclusive scattering\ncross section and the differential hadron production cross sections is illustrated\nschematically in the right panel of Fig. 2. PDFs are falling functions of the momentum\nfraction x. The evaluation of the parton distribution function at an effectively larger\nvalue of x leads to a reduction of the cross section. From our theory we can easily\nderive a hierarchy of dynamical high-twist shadowing,\nS(x, Q2 ) =\n\n\u2212\u2206\u03c3(x, Q2 )\n\u03c3(x, Q2 )\n\n,\n\nSv (x, Q2 ) < Ss (x, Q2 ) < Sg (x, Q2 ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nfor cross sections with multiple scattering dominated by valence quarks, sea quarks or\ngluons, respectively.\nIn [1], we completed the summation of all-twist, nuclear-enhanced power\ncorrections for massive-quark final states. In hadronic collisions, we identify the\nfunction that contains the small xb dependence Fab\u2192cd (xb ) = \u03c6b/N (xb )|Mab\u2192cd |2 /xb .\nImplementing the normalization to no nuclear effect on a single nucleon as follows,\nA1/3 \u2192 A1/3 \u2212 1, and having allowed for both massless and massive partons (quarks\nor gluons) we find [1]\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u03be 2 (A1/3 \u2212 1)\n.\n(4)\nFab\u2192cd (xb ) \u21d2 Fab\u2192cd xb 1 + Cd\n\u2212t\u0302 + m2d\n\nIn Eq.

The mass here reduces the effect of power corrections at \u2212t\u0302 \u2243 m2d .\nWhile we have focused in detail on the power corrections in the t-channel, it\nshould be noted that the coherent initial- and final-state interactions of the incoming\nparton from the proton have also been calculated [1]. The results, that we present\nhere, are analogous to Eq.

(4), (5)\nand (6) it is easy to see that in the forward rapidity region |t\u0302| \u226a |\u015d|, |\u00fb| only DIS-like\ndynamical shadowing corrections are important.\nIn processes with no strong final-state interactions, such as the Drell-Yan,\ncoherent multiple initial-state scattering can give only enhancement of the cross\nsection, as shown in Eq. (5), because of the rescaling of xb to smaller versus larger\nvalues. Thus, initial-state multiple soft interactions without energy loss always lead\nto a Cronin effect, independently of whether they are treated as coherent or not. The\nderivations, summarized here, are critical to elucidating the dynamical origin of nuclear\neffects in high energy hadronic reactions.

Therefore, these\nare not factorizable as a part of the parton distribution functions and fragmentation\nfunctions.\n4. Energy loss in cold nuclear matter\nIn the presence of a nucleus, final-state rescattering of the struck small-x parton\nwith its remnants exhausts the similarity between hadronic collisions, such as p+A\nand A+A, and DIS [6]. In l + A (DIS), the multiple interactions of the incoming\nleptons are suppressed by powers of \u03b1em /\u03b1s relative to the struck parton scattering.\nIn contrast, in p+A and A+A the initial- and final-state scattering of the incoming\nquarks and gluons are equally strong. Nuclear modification, in particular jet energy\nloss associated with the suppression of particle production, cannot be neglected.\nTo illustrate the importance of energy loss, we study the nuclear modification\nof hadron production over a large range of center of mass energies and momentum\nfractions xb . We implement the presently well known incoherent limit of energy loss\nfor asymptotic t = \u2212\u221e on-shell partons first derived in [8]. The double differential\ngluon intensity spectrum per scattering and the fractional energy loss \u01eb read:\n(1)\n\n\u03c9dNg\nq2\n\u03b1s\n,\n\u221d 2 2\n2\nd\u03c9d k\n\u03c0 k (k \u2212 q)2\n\n\u01eb=\n\n\u2206E\nL\n\u221d = \u03baA1/3 ,\nE\n\u03bb\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k is the transverse momentum of the radiative gluon, q is the transverse\nmomentum transfer from the medium and \u03c9 is the gluon energy. In Eq. (7) L/\u03bb\nis the number of interactions and \u03ba = 0.0175 for minimum bias reactions implies that\nan average parton loses \u223c 10% of its energy in a large nucleus such as Au or Pb.\nWe first examine the results obtained by the CERN NA35 fixed target experiment\n\u221a\nwith ycm = 3.

The left panel of Fig. 3 shows this forward\nrapidity suppression of negative hadrons relative to the baseline y \u2212 ycm \u2248 \u22121.5\nproduction cross section. Dynamical shadowing calculations [6] give < 5% effect at\nthis energy in this rapidity range. Conversely, the implementation of energy loss in cold\nnuclear matter leads to much larger suppression at forward rapidity and significant\nimprovement in the theoretical\u221adescription of the data in Fig. 3.\nIn the other extreme, at s = 200 GeV d+Au collisions at RHIC, the STAR\ncollaboration observed a factor of 3 suppression of \u03c0 0 production at rapidity y = 4 [11].\nThe right panel of Fig. 3 shows that dynamical high-twist shadowing, constrained\nby the DIS data down to values of Bjorken xB \u223c 10\u22124 , underpredicts the nuclear\nattenuation by a factor of 2. Incorporating the same energy loss that we identified at\nmuch smaller center of mass energies, we observe very good agreement between theory\nand the data [1].\n5. Numerical results\nTo illustrate the similarities and differences between massless and massive final-state\npartons, we carry out a comparative study of the effect of power corrections on single\nand double inclusive \u03c0 0 and D meson production. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows\nthe suppression of the low and moderate pT1 neutral pion cross section from hightwist shadowing relative to the binary scaled p+p result. The nuclear modification\nfactor is shown for two different forward rapidities, y1 \u221a\n= 1.25, 2.5, and three different\ncentralities, b = 3 fm, bmin.bias = 5.6 fm, b = 6.8 fm, in s = 200 GeV d+Au collisions\nat RHIC. At transverse momenta pT1 = 1.5 GeV the suppression can be substantial,\nbut disappears toward higher pT1 due to the power law nature of the effect.

Theory does not include energy\nloss. Right panel from [1]: the same calculation with cold nuclear matter energy\nloss of the Brtsch-Gunion type [8] included. Data is from PHENIX [12, 13].\nBottom panels show impact parameter dependence of the calculated nuclear\nmodification for central, b = 3 fm, minimum bias, bmin.bias = 5.6 fm and\nperipheral, b = 6.8 fm, collisions.\n\nPHENIX experiment [12] and the discrepancy becomes larger at higher transverse\nmomenta. The calculated suppression of D0 + D+ mesons (and equivalently, D\u03040 + D\u2212\nmesons), in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC is also shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. It\nshould be noted that the nuclear modification is very similar to or slightly larger than\nthat for \u03c0 0 . The reason for this similarity is that in both cases the dominant channel\nof hadron production is via quarks scattering on gluons, which have the same (large)\ncolor singlet coupling to the medium, Cd = 9/4 in Eq. (4). In addition, the typical\nmomentum fraction, z1 , which enters in the determination of the hard scale, t\u0302 \u221d 1/z1 ,\nis slightly larger for the D mesons. Preliminary PHENIX data on the modification of\n\u03bc\u2212 coming from the decay of heavy flavor at y = 1.6 in cold nuclear matter is provided\nas a reference [13]. Although the error bars are large, D mesons seem to be suppressed\nas much as light hadrons.\nHaving investigated the largest dynamic range of measurements in proton(deuteron)nucleus reactions accessible to perturbative QCD calculations in the previous section,\nwe return to D meson production and correlations at RHIC. We use the same fractional energy loss \u01eb = \u2206E/E as in Fig. 3. Single inclusive \u03c0 0 and D0 +D+ suppression\nat rapidities y1 = 1.25, 2.5 and minimum bias, central and peripheral d+Au collisions\nat RHIC are shown in the right panel of Fig. 4. In this case, very good agreement\nbetween the QCD theory incorporating cold nuclear matter effects and the PHENIX\nmeasurement of muons coming from the decay of light hadrons [12] is achieved. We\nfind that the magnitude of the D meson suppression is similar to that of pions. It is\nalso comparable with the first forward rapidity results on heavy quark nuclear modification in d+Au reactions at RHIC [13]. Nuclear modification of inclusive two particle\nproduction is seen to follow closely that of single inclusive hadrons [1].\nThere are similarities between the calculations that only include resummed\n\n\f8\nnuclear-enhanced power corrections, left panel of Fig. 4, and the calculations that do\nnot neglect energy loss in cold nuclear matter, right panel of Fig. 4. Both effects are\ngenerated through multiple parton scattering in the medium and lead to suppression\nof the rate of hard scattering [1]. In both cases single inclusive particle production\nand large angle di-hadron correlations are similarly attenuated. Like all nuclear many\nbody effects, these increase with the centrality of the collision. The difference in the\nresulting nuclear modification is that high-twist shadowing arises from the coherent\nfinal-state scattering of the struck small-xb parton of the nucleus [7] and disappears\nas a function of the transverse momentum [6]. The energy loss considered here arises\nfrom the initial-state inelastic scattering of the incoming large-xa parton from the\nproton(deuteron) [8] and leads to a suppression which is much more pT independent,\nsimilar to final state energy loss applications [2].\n6. Conclusions\nIn these proceedings, we summarized the results of the first perturbative QCD\ncalculation of heavy meson triggered large-angle di-hadron yields [1] and showed how\nsuch measurements can provide information on the D meson production mechanism\nand the non-perturbative fragmentation of heavy quarks. We identified multiple\nscattering effects that drive the cold nuclear matter attenuation of D meson and\nlight hadron production at forward rapidities, namely, high twist shadowing [6, 7]\nand parton energy loss [8, 9].\nOur work demonstrates [1] how such effects\ncan be independently constrained by DIS data (shadowing) and low energy p+A\nmeasurements [10] where coherent power corrections are not important (energy loss).\nIn the framework of the established QCD collinear factorization, our approach of\nincorporating dynamically generated and process-dependent nuclear effects is expected\nto give a more reliable description of particle production [11, 12, 13] in p+A collisions.\nThis work also provides the baseline for precision QGP tomography using heavy quarks\nas probes of the plasma away from midrapidity [1] where new experimental capabilities\nat RHIC and the LHC are expected to become available.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank my collaborators Terry Goldman, Mikkel\nJohnson and Jianwei Qiu for useful comments.
