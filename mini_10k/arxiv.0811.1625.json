Hardy's thought experiment [1] is a typical\nexample in which we encounter such a difficulty. Figure 1(a) shows a photonic version\nof the experiment, which was demonstrated by Irvine et al. recently [2]. The scheme\nconsists of two Mach-Zehnder interferometers MZ1 and MZ2 with their inner arms\n(O1 , O2 ) overlapping on each other at the 50:50 beam splitter BS3. If photons 1 and\n2 simultaneously arrive at BS3, due to a two-photon interference effect, they always\nemerge at the same port. This corresponds to the positron-electron annihilation in the\noriginal thought experiment [1]. The path lengths of MZ1 are adjusted so that photon 1\nshould never appear at C1 by destructive interference, when photon 2 passes the outer\narm NO2 and thus has no disturbance on MZ1. The path lengths of MZ2 are adjusted\nsimilarly. Then, a coincidence detection at C1 and C2 gives a paradoxical statement on\nwhich paths the detected photons have taken. The detection at C1 (C2 ) implies that\nMZ1 (MZ2) has been disturbed by photon 2 (1) travelling along O2 (O1 ). We may thus\ninfer that the conditional probabilities satisfy\nP (O1|C1 C2 ) = P (O2 |C1 C2 ) = 1.\n\n(1)\n\nOn the other hand, if both photons had taken the inner arms, the coincidence detection\nwould have never happened due to the two photon interference. Hence we infer that\nP (O1O2 |C1 C2 ) = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nThe two inferred statements are apparently contradictory to each other, which is the\nwell-known Hardy's paradox.\nOne may argue that we should abandon the attempt to address the question itself,\non the ground that the trajectory of photons cannot be measured without utterly\nchanging the time evolution. But this reasoning is not necessarily true if we are\nallowed to repeat the same experiment many times. Aharonov et al. has proposed\nweak measurement [3, 4], in which a measurement apparatus (meter) interacts with\nthe system to be measured so weakly that the state of the system is not significantly\ndisturbed. The readout of the meter from a single run of experiment may be subtle\nand noisy, but by taking the average over many runs we can correctly estimate the\nexpectation value of the measured observable, h\u03c8 |\u00c2| \u03c8i, when the initial state of the\nmeasured system is | \u03c8i. In this setup, we may ask what is the averaged readout over\nthe runs in which the system is finally found to be in a state | \u03c6i. In the limit of no\ndisturbance, this gives an operational way of defining what is the value of \u00c2 at the\nmiddle of a time evolution from | \u03c8i to | \u03c6i, and is found to be given by the real part of\nthe following expression\n\u00c2w \u2261 h\u03c6|\u00c2|\u03c8i/h\u03c6|\u03c8i,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is called the weak value of \u00c2. So far, related interesting features were discussed\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and experimental observations of weak values were reported\n[12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\n\n\fLD2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nIF\n\nHWP\n\nC2\n\nNO2\nC2\n\nNO2\n\nBS4\n\nBS6\nMZ2\n\nC1\n\nO2\n\nPBS\n\nBS6\n\nP2\n\nBS4\n\nC1\nIF\n\nO2\n\nMZ2\n\nPBS\n\nO1\nBS2\n\nBS7\n\nBS3\nMZ1\n\n2\n\nPD2\n\nHWP4\n\nBS2\n\nHWP2\n1\n\nBS1\n\nHWP\n\nLD1\n\nO1\n\nNO1\nBS3\n\nHWP5\n\nBS7\n\nQuartz plates\n\nBS5\n\nMZ1\n\n2\n\nNO1\n\nWeak Measurement\nHWP1\n\nBS1\n\nBS5\n\n1\n\nUV\n\nP1\n\nQuartz\n\nBBO\n\nPD1\n\nHWP3\n\nFigure 1. Experimental setup for Hardy's paradox. (a) The photonic version of\nHardy's thought experiment. Each of the MZ interferometers MZ1 and MZ2 is\ncomposed of four 50:50 beam splitters (BS). (b) The schematics of the experiment\nwith joint weak measurement. Entangled photon pairs are generated via spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion from a pair of type I phase matched 2mm thick BBO\ncrystal [17] pumped by a UV pulse (a central wave length 395nm and an average\npower 180mW). The UV pulse is taken from the frequency doubled Ti:sapphire laser\n(wavelength, 790nm; pulse width, 140fs; repetition rate, 76MHz). Quartz crystals are\nused to compensate the group velocity mismatch and adjust the relative phase between\nhorizontal and vertical polarization state. Polarization dependent phase shifts in MZs\nare compensated by quartz plates in the MZs so that MZs give the same phase shifts\nto any polarization state. Extra laser diodes (LDs) and photo diodes (PDs) are used\nfor adjusting and stabilizing the optical lengths of MZs via piezo stage (Ps). The\nphotons are detected by photon detectors (Cs). The observed visibility of two photon\ninterference at BS3 was 97.8 \u00b1 0.3% for horizontally polarized photons.\n\nSuppose that weak measurements of trajectories are applied to Hardy's experiment\nat the shaded regions in Fig. 1(a). The state of the photons entering these regions\n\u221a\nis |\u03c8i = (|NO1 i|O2i + |O1i|NO2 i + |NO1 i|NO2 i)/ 3, and the coincidence detection\nretrodicts the state leaving the regions to be |\u03c6i = (|NO1 i \u2212 |O1i)(|NO2 i \u2212 |O2i)/2 [8].\nThen the weak values can be calculated to be\n|O1, O2 ihO1 , O2|w = 0, |NO1 , NO2 ihNO1 , NO2 |w = \u22121,\n|O1, NO2 ihO1, NO2 |w = 1, |NO1 , O2 ihNO1 , O2 |w = 1.\n\n(4)\n\nThe first equation implies Eq. (2) holds. We also see that Eq. (1) holds since, for\ninstance, |O1 ihO1 |w = |O1, O2 ihO1, O2 |w +|O1, NO2 ihO1 , NO2 |w = 1. Hence the readout\nof the meter is indeed consistent with both of the naively inferred conditions (1) and (2).\nThe reason why these two contradictory conditions are satisfied at the same time can\nnow be ascribed to the appearance of a negative value, |NO1 , NO2 ihNO1 , NO2 |w = \u22121.\nIt implies that the average readout over post-selected events falls on a value that never\nappears if no post-selection is involved.\nIn this paper, we report an experimental demonstration of weak measurements\napplied to Hardy's experiment. Since the observables to be measured are of path\n\n\fcorrelations between the two photons, we need to implement a joint weak measurement\nthat can extract such correlations. Although a number of schemes for joint weak\nmeasurement have been proposed [18, 19], here we propose the most intuitive approach\nusing meter qubits initially prepared in an entangled state. We conducted measurements\nwith varied strength, and confirmed that it works properly when each photon is injected\nto a fixed arm. We also measured the visibility of the interferometers to verify that the\ndisturbance vanishes in the limit of weak measurement. Then we conducted Hardy's\nexperiments and observed that, as the measurement became weaker, three readouts\nmoved toward the conditions (1) and (2) while another readout went to negative.\nLet us first introduce our scheme of joint weak measurement for two qubits in a\ngeneral setting. Let {| 0i, | 1i} be the standard basis of a qubit. For weak measurement\nof the observable | 0ih0 | of a qubit, one can prepare another qubit in a suitable state\nand apply a controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate between the two qubits [14]. Here we want\nto carry out weak measurements of observables | klis1 s2 hkl | (k, l = 0, 1) for the two\nsignal qubits, s1 and s2 , and we may use two meter qubits, m1 and m2 , and apply two\nC-NOT gates in parallel. The signal (meter) qubit corresponds to the control (target)\nqubit and the meter qubit is flipped when the signal qubit is in |1i. Note that in our\nimplementation of Hardy's experiment, the photon path corresponds to the signal qubit\nand its polarization to the meter qubit. We found that the desired weak measurements\nare achieved by a simple choice of the initial state of the meter qubits,\n|\u03beim = \u03b4|00im1 m2 + \u03b5(|01im1m2 + |10im1m2 + |11im1 m2 )\nX\n= (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)|00im1 m2 + \u03b5\n|klim1 m2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nkl\n\n2\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03b4 + 3\u03b5 = 1 and \u03b4 \u2265 \u03b5 \u2265 0. When the signal qubits are in |\u03c8is =\nthe application of the parallel C-NOT operation Usm results in\n\nP\n\nij\n\ncij |ijis1 s2 ,\n\nUsm |\u03c8is |\u03beim\nX\nX\n=\ncij |ijis1 s2 [(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)|ijim1 m2 + \u03b5\n|klim1 m2 ]\nij\n\nkl\n\nX\n=\n[(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)|klis1 s2 hkl| + \u03b5]|\u03c8is |klim1 m2 .\n\n(6)\n\nkl\n\nThe meter qubits will then be measured in the basis {| klim1 m2 } to produce an outcome\n(k, l). If the signal qubits are in state |ijis1 s2 initially, the probability Pm (k, l) of outcome\n(k, l) becomes\n(\n\u03b4 2 ((k, l) = (i, j))\nPm (k, l) =\n(7)\n\u03b52 ((k, l) 6= (i, j)).\nWe see that the outcome (i, j), corresponding to the state of the signal, has a larger\nprobability than the others. The contrast \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 will be regarded as the measurement\nstrength. When \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 = 1 (\u03b4 = 1, \u03b5 = 0), this scheme gives a projection measurement\n(strong measurement) on the signal qubits. Decreasing \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 makes the measurement\nweaker, and at \u03b4 2 \u2212\u03b52 = 0 (\u03b4 = \u03b5 = 1/2), the operation of Usm introduces no disturbance\n\n\fon the signal qubits (Appendix A). Let us introduce a normalized readout R(k, l) by\nR(k, l) \u2261 [Pm (k, l) \u2212 \u03b52 ]/(\u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 ).\n\n(8)\n\nThen, regardless of the value of \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 > 0, we have R(k, l) = 1 for (k, l) = (i, j) and\nP\nR(k, l) = 0 otherwise. When the initial state of the signal qubits is | \u03c8is = ij cij |ijis1 s2 ,\nthe normalized readout becomes R(k, l) = |ck,l |2 , which coincides with the expectation\nvalue h| klis1s2 hkl |i. Of course, for the estimation of R(k, l) and hence of Pm (k, l), we\nneed to repeat the preparation of the initial state | \u03c8is and the measurement many\ntimes.\nNow in a situation like Hardy's experiment, we are interested in the readout of the\nmeter on condition that the signal qubits are finally measured to be in state | \u03c6is. From\nthe definition (3), we have\n=\n\ns h\u03c6|Usm |\u03c8is |\u03beim\n\nX\n[(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)|klis1 s2 hkl|w + \u03b5]s h\u03c6|\u03c8is|klim .\n\n(9)\n\nkl\n\nThe conditional probability of the outcome (k, l) is then given by\nPm (k, l|\u03c6) = |(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)|klis1 s2 hkl|w + \u03b5|2 /[1 \u2212 (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)2 \u03b6]\nP\nwith \u03b6 \u2261 1 \u2212 ij ||ijis1 s2 hij|w |2 . The normalized readout is found to be\n\nR(k, l|\u03c6) \u2261 [Pm (k, l|\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b52 ]/(\u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 )\n2\u03b5(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)Re[|klis1 s2 hkl|w ] + (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)2 [||klis1s2 hkl|w |2 + \u03b52 \u03b6]\n=\n(\u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 )[1 \u2212 (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5)2 \u03b6]\n\u2192 Re[|klis1 s2 hkl|w ] (\u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2192 0).\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nWe see that the normalized readout in the limit of no disturbance coincides with the\nreal part of the weak value.\nIn our experiment, the signal qubit corresponds to the paths taken by the photon\nas | 0i = | NOi and | 1i = | Oi, whereas the meter qubit is assigned to the polarization\n\u221a\nof the same photon as | 0i = | +i and | 1i = | \u2212i, where |\u00b1i \u2261 (|Hi \u00b1 |V i)/ 2 and H/V\nis the horizontal/vertical polarization. The interferometers in Fig. 1(a) are constructed\nso that there is no polarization dependence, except for the shaded region where wave\nplates are placed to realize Usm . The polarization dependence of the coincidence events\nis then analyzed to determine Pm (k, l|\u03c6).\nThe detail of the setup is shown in Fig. 1(b). We generate the photon pairs in a\nnonmaximally entangled state \u03b7|HHi12 + \u03b7\u0304|V V i12 from PDC, where \u03b7 2 + \u03b7\u0304 2 = 1 and\n\u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 are properly adjusted to be real numbers. The coefficients \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304, which\ncan be tuned by HWP3, are determined by the ratio between the coincidence counts\nof |HHi and |V V i. The state is transformed into |\u03beim by rotating the polarization\nof two photons by half wave plates HWP1 and HWP2. The measurement strength is\nsimply calculated by the measured \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 and the angle of HWP1 and HWP2. After\nthe photons pass through BS1, BS2 and BS3, the two-photon state is represented as\n|\u03c8is |\u03beim .

The polarization basis (| +i, | \u2212i) for the meter measurement is selected\nby HWP and PBS just before detectors C1 and C2 . The coincidence counts, typically\na few thousands, are accumulated over 5-12 min per basis to determine each R(k, l|\u03c6).\nAll error bars assume the Poisson statistics of the counts.\nFirst we show the observed trade-off between the measurement strength and the\nvisibilities of interference at MZ1 and MZ2. The measurements were done as follows:\nWe blocked the arm O2 (O1 ) and recorded the coincidence detection at C1 and C2 by\nchanging the path length via piezo stage P1 (P2 ). In order to measure the polarizationindependent visibilities, we measured the interference fringes in the states | + +i, | + \u2212i,\n| \u2212+i, and | \u2212\u2212i independently and calculated the average visibility. The visibilities for\nvarious measurement strengths are shown in Fig. 2. We can clearly see that weakening\nthe measurement makes the visibility larger (Appendix B).\nWe also show that our measurement gives proper values of the readouts R(k, l|\u03c6)\nwhen the photons travel the fixed arms |O1 , NO2 i, |NO1 , O2 i, and |NO1 , NO2 i. We\nblocked the arms of no interest and determined R(k, l|\u03c6) from the coincidence detection\non the basis { | + +i, | + \u2212i, | \u2212 +i, | \u2212 \u2212i } . The experimental results are plotted\nin Fig. 3. In any measurement strength, the corresponding readout for the signal state\nis close to 1 and the other readouts are close to 0. This clearly shows the apparatus\nproperly measures the trajectories of the photons. The systematic deviation from the\nexpected values at small values of \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 is believed to be the results of very tiny\nmisalignments of the axes of the wave plates. Such an enhancement is a feature of weak\nmeasurement and can be used for super-sensitive measurements as shown in [16].\nWith this meter, we performed measurements of the trajectories of the photons in\nHardy's thought experiment. The observed readouts are shown in Fig. 4. Let us see\nthe results around 0.3 measurement strength.

Observed readouts in Hardy's experiment. The curves that roughly fit the\ndata points are of a simple model of imperfections, and are only shown to guide the\neye.\n\nsmall at this strength. For each of the photons, the readouts suggest a high probability\nof taking the overlapped arm: R(O1 |\u03c6) \u2261 R(O1 , NO2 |\u03c6)+R(O1, O2|\u03c6) = 0.72\u00b10.09 and\nR(O2 |\u03c6) = 0.53 \u00b1 0.09. Nonetheless, the readout for the joint probability is around zero,\nnamely, R(O1 , O2|\u03c6) = \u22120.18 \u00b1 0.05. We also see that R(NO1 , NO2 |\u03c6) = \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.04\ntakes a large negative value, which cannot be interpreted as a probability. Although\nthe statistical and systematic errors are large around zero measurement strength, we\nsee that R(O1 , NO2 |\u03c6), R(NO1 , O2|\u03c6), R(O1 , O2|\u03c6), and R(NO1 , NO2 |\u03c6) approach the\nexpected weak values in Eq. (4) when the measurement strength goes to 0.\nLet us emphasize here that our experimental results by themselves can elucidate\nthe paradoxical nature of Hardy's experiment, without any reference to the theory\nexplaining how our measurement works. From the results in Fig. 3, we see that our\nmeasurement apparatus should properly give the probabilities on the trajectories of the\nphotons, if such quantities ever exist. Then, in Hardy's setup, the same measurement\npresents a contradictory statement in Fig. 4 that the probability of finding a photon\nin arm O1 approaches 1 and so does the probability for arm O2 , whereas the joint\n\n\fprobability of photons being in both of the arms stays at about 0. Moreover, the readout\npoints to a negative value for the joint probability for arms NO1 and NO2 . Unlike\nHardy's original argument, our demonstration reveals the paradox by observation, rather\nthan inference.\nWe have experimentally demonstrated a joint weak measurement with an entangled\nphoton pair and directly observed paradoxical results in Hardy's thought experiment.\nOur demonstration clearly reproduces Hardy's paradox in an experimentally accessible\nmanner. Weak measurements have attracted attention due to the possibility of achieving\nsmall-backaction and high-sensitivity measurements by simple optical setups. We believe\nthe demonstrated joint weak measurement is useful not only for exploiting fundamental\nquantum physics, but also for various applications such as quantum metrology and\nquantum information technology.\nNote added. During the preparation of this manuscript, we came to know of a\nwork by Lundeen and Steinberg [20], which has demonstrated similar results by using,\ninterestingly, different methods for joint weak measurement and for constructing Hardy's\ninterferometer.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was partially supported by the JSPS (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research\n(C) number 20540389) and by the MEXT (Grant- in-Aid for Scientific Research on\nInnovative Areas number 20104003, Global COE Program and Young Scientists(B)\nnumber 20740232).\nAppendix A.\nThe positive operator valued measure (POVM) for the measurement on the signal qubits\nis given by\nX\n\u03a0\u0302kl = \u03b4 2 |klis1 s2 hkl| + \u03b52\n|ijis1 s2 hij|\nij6=kl\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5 )|klis1 s2 hkl| + \u03b52 .\n\n(A.1)\n\nThe same POVM can be realized also by a nonentangled initial state of the meter qubits,\n\u03b4 2 |00im1 m2 h00| + \u03b52(|01im1 m2 h01| + |10im1m2 h10| + |11im1m2 h11|). This separable state of\nthe meter qubits, however, fails to derive a joint weak value, because the signal qubits\nare utterly disturbed even if \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52 = 0.\nAppendix B.\nA general relation between the visibility V and the measurement strength was discussed\nin [21]. It was shown that V 2 + K 2 \u2264 1 holds, where K \u2261 1 \u2212 2perr stands for\nthe measurement strength defined in terms of the error probability perr in the whichpath measurement. In our case, the initial marginal state of the meter qubit m1 is\n\n\fa mixed state, which is, from Eq. (5), calculated to be a mixture of state | \u03c60 im1 \u2261\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(\u03b4| 0im1 + \u03b5| 1im1 )/ p0 with probability p0 \u2261 \u03b4 2 + \u03b52 and | \u03c61im1 \u2261 (| 0im1 + | 1im1 )/ 2\nwith p1 \u2261 2\u03b52 . Thep\nstate | \u03c60 im1 leads to a measurement strength K0 = (\u03b4 2 \u2212\u03b52 )/(\u03b4 2 +\u03b52)\nand visibility V0 = 1 \u2212 K02 = 2\u03b5\u03b4/(\u03b4 2 +\u03b52 ), whereas | \u03c61 im1 leads to K1 = 0 and V1 = 1.\nHence, on average, the measurement strength becomes Kave \u2261 p0 K0 + p1 K1 = \u03b4 2 \u2212 \u03b52\nand Vave \u2261 p0 V0 + p1 V1 = 2\u03b5(\u03b4 + \u03b5), which is shown as the solid curve in Fig. 3. Due\nto the mixture, the averaged values Kave and Vave do not saturate the general bound\n2\n2\nVave\n+ Kave\n\u2264 1.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nL.
