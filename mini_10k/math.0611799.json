In [4\u2104 Drinfel'd introdu ed the lassi al double of a\nLie bialgebra (g, g\u2217 ), whi h ombines g and g\u2217 into a single Lie algebra g \u22b2\u22b3 g\u2217 whi h en odes\nfully the relations between g and g\u2217 . (We do not onsider quantum doubles in this paper.)\nIn ategori al language the word `double' des ribes an obje t of type X in the ategory\nof all obje ts X . Thus a `double ve tor bundle' is a ve tor bundle D \u2192 A in whi h both\nthe total spa e and base spa e are obje ts in the ategory of ve tor bundles, say D \u2192 B and\nA \u2192 M ; the maps de\u001cning the stru ture of D \u2192 A must be morphisms in the ategory of\nve tor bundles. (More detail is given below and in \u009f1.) The notion of a double ategory, the\nfundamental prototype of this on ept of double, was introdu ed and developed by Ehresmann\n[6\u2104. Double ategories should be distinguished from the more re ent notions of 2\u0015 ategory and\nbi ategory.\nWe show in this paper that the Drinfel'd double of a Lie bialgebra may be regarded as a\ndouble in the Ehresmann sense. Further, we show that the otangent of (either bundle in) a\nLie bialgebroid is a double in the Ehresmann sense, and that this onstru tion redu es to the\nDrinfel'd double when the Lie bialgebroid is a Lie bialgebra.\nThe ru ial step is to de\u001cne a on ept of double in the Ehresmann sense for Lie algebroids.\nThe de\u001cnition annot be pre isely of the type des ribed above sin e the bra ket of a Lie\nalgebroid is not a map in the ategory of ve tor bundles. We use an indire t approa h\n(De\u001cnition 3.1) and show, in \u009f6, that this is an in\u001cnitesimal form of doubles of Ehresmann\ntype.\nA double Lie algebroid is \u001crst of all a double ve tor bundle as in Figure 1(a); that is, D\n\nD\n\n/B\n\nTA\n\n/ TM\n\nT \u2217A\n\n/ A\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n( )\n\nFigure 1.\nhas two ve tor bundle stru tures, on bases A and B , ea h of whi h is itself a ve tor bundle on\nbase M , su h that for ea h stru ture on D , the stru ture maps (proje tion, addition, s alar\nmultipli ation) are ve tor bundle morphisms with respe t to the other stru ture, and the\nombination of the two proje tions, D \u2192 A \u00d7M B , is a surje tive submersion (see \u009f1 for more\ndetail). Two examples to keep in mind are the tangent prolongation of an ordinary ve tor\nbundle as in Figure 1(b) (see [1\u2104 for a lassi al treatment), and the otangent double ve tor\nbundle as in Figure 1( ) (see [26\u2104).\nNow suppose that all four sides of Figure 1(a) have Lie algebroid stru tures. The problem is\nto de\u001cne ompatibility between the bra ket stru tures on D , bearing in mind that the bra kets\nare on di\u001berent modules of se tions. The key is the duality for double ve tor bundles des ribed\nin \u009f1. Although our ompatibility ondition annot (as far as we know) be interpreted as a\nondition of the form `either bra ket stru ture on (se tions of) D is a morphism with respe t\n2\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nto the other', we show in Theorem 6.2 that this on ept of double Lie algebroid in ludes the\nin\u001cnitesimal invariants of double Lie groupoids, whi h are de\u001cned by su h onditions. We\ntherefore feel justi\u001ced in referring to it as a double of Ehresmannian type, or a ategori al\ndouble.\nIn \u009f4 we de\u001cne a notion of double for Lie bialgebroids. A Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ) on\nbase M [26\u2104 onsists of Lie algebroid stru tures on a ve tor bundle and its dual, subje t to a\nompatibility ondition whi h an be most su in tly expressed by saying that the di\u001berential\nof ea h Lie algebroid a ts as a derivation on the S houten (or Gerstenhaber) algebra asso iated\nwith the other [9\u2104.\nGiven a Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ), the Lie algebroid stru ture on A indu es a Poisson stru ture on A\u2217 by an extension [3\u2104 of the duality between Lie algebras and linear Poisson stru tures on ve tor spa es. This Poisson stru ture in turn indu es a Lie algebroid stru ture on\nT \u2217 A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 , de\u001cned in terms of the Poisson bra ket of 1\u0015forms. Likewise, the Lie algebroid\nstru ture on A\u2217 indu es a Lie algebroid stru ture on T \u2217 A \u2192 A. Using the anoni al di\u001beomorphism T \u2217 A\u2217 \u2192 T \u2217 A [26\u2104 we now have Lie algebroid stru tures on ea h of the four sides of\nFigure 1( ). This is a double Lie algebroid as de\u001cned in \u009f3, the otangent double of (A, A\u2217 ).\nSuppose now that we have Lie algebroid stru tures on A and A\u2217 with no further assumption. As above, the Poisson stru tures on A\u2217 and A indu e Lie algebroid stru tures on\nT \u2217 A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 and T \u2217 A \u2192 A and we prove in \u009f4 that if these onstitute a double Lie algebroid\nstru ture on T \u2217 A, then (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid.\nWhen M is a point, so that A = g and A\u2217 are Lie algebras, the otangent manifold T \u2217 g\nis g \u00d7 g\u2217 . The Lie algebroid stru ture on g \u00d7 g\u2217 \u2192 g is the a tion, or transformation, Lie\nalgebroid de\u001cned by the oadjoint a tion of g\u2217 on g; likewise the oadjoint a tion of g on g\u2217\nde\u001cnes the Lie algebroid stru ture on g \u00d7 g\u2217 \u2192 g\u2217 . These stru tures have not been mu h used,\nsin e g \u00d7 g\u2217 has the lassi al Drinfel'd double stru ture g \u22b2\u22b3 g\u2217 , as a Lie algebra.\nFor an arbitrary Lie bialgebroid (A, A\u2217 ) there is no known Lie algebroid stru ture on\nT \u2217 A \u2192 M (and indeed there is no natural ve tor bundle stru ture) whi h redu es to g \u22b2\u22b3 g\u2217\nin the bialgebra ase. Consequently there is no dire t analogue for T \u2217 A of the Manin triple\ntheorem (as in [14\u2104) whi h, for a pair of Lie algebra stru tures on dual ve tor spa es, gives a\nriterion for them to form a Lie bialgebra. Nonetheless Theorem 4.1 provides a riterion for\na pair of Lie algebroid stru tures on dual ve tor bundles to form a Lie bialgebroid.\nA Manin triple theorem for Lie bialgebroids whi h dire tly generalizes the Lie bialgebra\nresult, was given by Liu, Weinstein, and Xu [11\u2104, whose notion of double is a Courant algebroid\nstru ture on the dire t sum A \u2295 A\u2217 . Some omments on the di\u001beren es between the two\napproa hes are given at the end of \u009f4.\nThe la k of a stru ture on T \u2217 A \u2192 M is an inherent feature of the otangent. A otangent\ndouble ve tor bundle T \u2217 A is lo ally isomorphi to A \u00d7M A\u2217 \u00d7M T \u2217 M and is of the form\nA \u00d7M A\u2217 if and only if M is 0\u0015dimensional.\nWe all a double Lie algebroid (D; A, B; M ) va ant if D is isomorphi to A \u00d7M B as a\ndouble ve tor bundle. We prove in \u009f5 that in this ase there are indu ed a tions \u03c1 of A on B\nand \u03c3 of B on A, and these satisfy the equations\n\n\u03c1X ([Y1 , Y2 ]) = [\u03c1X (Y1 ), Y2 ] + [Y1 , \u03c1X (Y2 )] + \u03c1\u03c3Y2 (X) (Y1 ) \u2212 \u03c1\u03c3Y1 (X) (Y2 ),\n\u03c3Y ([X1 , X2 ]) = [\u03c3Y (X1 ), X2 ] + [X1 , \u03c3Y (X2 )] + \u03c3\u03c1X2 (Y ) (X1 ) \u2212 \u03c3\u03c1X1 (Y ) (X2 ),\na(\u03c3Y (X)) \u2212 b(\u03c1X (Y )) = [b(Y ), a(X)],\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fK.

Conversely, given su h\na pair of a tions, A \u00d7M B has a double Lie algebroid stru ture.\nA pair of a tions satisfying (1) is alled a mat hed pair stru ture for A and B [31\u2104. This notion of mat hed pair extends the on ept introdu ed into geometry by Kosmann\u0015S hwarzba h\nand Magri [10\u2104 under the name extension bi rois\u00e9e or twilled extension, by Lu and Weinstein\n[14\u2104 as a double Lie algebra, and by Majid [28\u2104, with the term mat hed pair whi h we use.

As in the\nase of Lie algebras, given a mat hed pair stru ture for Lie algebroids A and B , the dire t\nsum bundle A \u2295 B has a Lie algebroid stru ture A \u22b2\u22b3 B for whi h A \u2295 0 and 0 \u2295 B are Lie\nsubalgebroids, and the onverse is also true [31\u2104.\nWe note here that Lu [12\u2104 showed that any Poisson a tion of a Poisson Lie group G on\na Poisson manifold P gives rise to a mat hed pair of Lie algebroids, and the orresponding\ndiagonal stru ture T \u2217 P \u22b2\u22b3 (P \u00d7 g\u2217 ) arries Drinfel'd's lassi\u001c ation of Poisson homogeneous\nspa es [5\u2104. In a future paper we will show that the orresponding onstru tion for an a tion\nof a general Poisson groupoid gives rise to a double Lie algebroid whi h is not va ant, and so\ndoes not orrespond to a mat hed pair.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThere are two further points to be made about the on ept of double Lie algebroid. Firstly,\na natural global analogue is provided by the on ept of double Lie groupoid [16\u2104: we show in\n\u009f6 that applying a se ond\u0015order version of the Lie fun tor to a double Lie groupoid yields a\ndouble Lie algebroid. This subsumes various known di\u001berentiation results and raises a general\nintegrability problem.\nIt is well known that Lie bialgebroids are the in\u001cnitesimal form of Poisson groupoids [36\u2104,\n[27\u2104. In the ase of Lie bialgebras a further step was a hieved by Lu and Weinstein [13\u2104 who\nproved the existen e of a symple ti double Lie groupoid integrating a Poisson Lie group.\nThe double Lie algebroid of this symple ti double Lie groupoid is the otangent double Lie\nalgebroid des ribed above.\nFor mat hed pairs of Lie algebras the global on ept of mat hed pair of Lie groups was\nintrodu ed into geometry at the same time [28\u2104, [14\u2104. The global on ept of a mat hed pair\nof Lie groupoids was given in [16\u2104. In the Lie algebra ase, various integrability results were\ngiven in the same papers, but little is known about the integrability of mat hed pairs of Lie\nalgebroids [24\u2104. As [13\u2104 shows, a mat hed pair of Lie algebras may fail to integrate to a\nmat hed pair of Lie groups, but nonetheless integrate to a double Lie groupoid.\nThe se ond point to be made is that the on ept of double Lie algebroid o\u001bers, at least\nin some situations, a means of bypassing the problems aused by the la k of pullba ks in\nthe Poisson ategory. It is well\u0015known that the a tion groupoid arising from the a tion of a\nPoisson Lie group G on a Poisson manifold P is not a Poisson groupoid. It was shown in [22\u2104\nthat the indu ed a tion of T \u2217 G \u21d2 g\u2217 on the dual p : T \u2217 P \u2192 g\u2217 of the in\u001cnitesimal a tion,\nalled the pith in [22\u2104, gives rise to a groupoid obje t in the ategory of Lie algebroids whi h\ndi\u001berentiates to Lu's mat hed pair of Lie algebroids. In the group ase one may work dire tly\nwith the mat hed pair but, as mentioned above, for a Poisson a tion of a Poisson groupoid,\nthe orresponding stru ture is a double Lie algebroid whi h does not redu e to a mat hed\npair.\nSin e the mid 1990s several authors have worked to provide a hara terization of the\notangent double of a Lie bialgebroid in terms of super geometry [34\u2104, [33\u2104. This has now\n4\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nbeen a hieved by Ted Voronov [35\u2104 who further gives a formulation of the general on ept of\ndouble Lie algebroid presented here in terms of super geometry. Independently, Mehta [30\u2104\nhas found a super formulation of the related notion of L A \u0015groupoid.\nOn a spe ulative level, one may ask what relation, if any, exists between this theory and\nthe weak multiple ategory theory that is used in some approa hes to \u001celd theory. The di\u001beren es between double Lie groupoid theory [16\u2104, [20\u2104 and the various notions of weak 2\u0015 ategory\nor bi ategory, are very onsiderable and it may be that there is no simple relationship. The\nexpe tation that a link may exist is perhaps based on the fa t that the notion of ordinary\nLie groupoid in ludes both the frame groupoids of di\u001berential geometry and the fundamental\ngroupoid of a manifold, and thus has both a di\u001berential geometri and a topologi al signi\u001c an e. However, this may be misleading as regards multiple stru tures: the homotopy\nproperties of double Lie groupoids present onsiderable problems, and the notion of weak\n2\u0015 ategory does not seem to readily a ept a smooth stru ture. Perhaps these matters an\nbe resolved, but in any ase the results of this paper, parti ularly in the light of \u009f6, appear to\nshow that multiple Lie groupoid theory is well suited to \u001cnite\u0015dimensional smooth di\u001berential\ngeometry.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAn announ ement of some of the main results of this paper was published in [17\u2104, and an\nearly version was arXived in [21\u2104. Amongst the many hanges between [21\u2104 and the urrent\npaper, the most striking is perhaps the simpli\u001c ation of the de\u001cnition 3.1 of a double Lie\nalgebroid, following the observation of Ted Voronov that in his super formulation [35\u2104, the\nanalogue of Condition II in [21\u2104 follows from Conditions I and III. This has enabled many\narguments to be onsiderably shortened.\nWe do not in lude oordinate representations in this paper. The use of intrinsi formulations keeps lear the nature of ea h stru ture and makes the lifting of results and de\u001cnitions\nfrom one level to another mu h easier. For example, most of the anoni al isomorphisms used\nin the paper have been introdu ed for manifolds or ve tor bundles, and are then lifted to\nvarious multiple stru tures. The fun torial nature of these pro esses is less lear in oordinate\nformulations. However, a oordinate\u0015based approa h is in luded in [35\u2104.\nThe material of this paper has developed over a onsiderable number of years and I\nhave bene\u001cted greatly from many onversations with Yvette Kosmann\u0015S hwarzba h, Alan\nWeinstein, and Ping Xu over this time. Conversations with Ted Voronov at the XXVth\nWorkshop on Geometry and Mathemati al Physi s at Biaaowie\u00bba in 2006 provided a ru ial\nstimulus for this revision and I am very grateful to him, and to the organizers of the Biaaowie\u00bba\nworkshop for providing, inter alia, the opportunity for extended onversations. I also wish to\nthank the organizers of the programme on Gerbes, Groupoids and Quantum Field Theory at\nthe ESI in 2006, where important parts of this revision were written.\n\n5\n\n\fK. C. H. Ma kenzie\n\n\u009f 1 DOUBLE VECTOR BUNDLES AND THEIR DUALITY\nWe begin by re alling the duality of double ve tor bundles whi h was introdu ed in [18\u2104, [8\u2104\nusing the duality whi h Pradines [32\u2104 had introdu ed for ve tor bundle obje ts in the ategory\nof Lie groupoids. See [15\u2104 for a fuller a ount.\nThe de\u001cnition of double ve tor bundle given in the Introdu tion (see Figure 1(a)) is omD : D \u2192 A and\nplete but needs elaboration. We denote the proje tions in Figure 1(a) by qA\nD\nqB : D \u2192 B ; these are ve tor bundle morphisms over the proje tions qB : B \u2192 M and\nD (d) = a and q D (d) = b, and q (a) = m, then we\nqA : A \u2192 M respe tively. If d \u2208 D has qA\nA\nB\nsay that d has outline (d; a, b; m).\nConsider four elements d1 , . . . , d4 of D with proje tions a1 , . . . , a4 in A and b1 , . . . , b4\nin B su h that a1 = a2 , a3 = a4 , b1 = b3 and b2 = b4 . Then the ondition that ea h\nbundle proje tion from D is a morphism of ve tor bundles with respe t to the other stru ture\nguarantees that both sides of\n\n(d1 +\nd2 ) +\n(d3 +\nd4 ) = (d1 +\nd3 ) +\n(d2 +\nd4 )\nA\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\n\n(2)\n\nare de\u001cned. Here +\ndenotes the addition in D \u2192 A and +\nthe addition in D \u2192 B . The\nA\nB\nondition that ea h addition be a ve tor bundle morphism with respe t to the other stru ture\nthen implies equality in (2). There are orresponding equations involving s alar multipli ation.\nEquation (2) is the inter hange law for addition.\n0a . Similarly the zero of D \u2192 B\nGiven a \u2208 A we denote the zero of D \u2192 A above a by e\nB\n0b . The zeros in A \u2192 M and B \u2192 M are denoted 0A\nabove b \u2208 B is denoted e\nm and 0m . The\n00A\n00B\nfor D \u2192 A and the zero e\nfor D \u2192 B are equal;\ninter hange law implies that the zero e\nm\nm\nthis is denoted \u2299m .\nThe interse tion of the kernels of the two proje tions de\u001cned on D is alled the ore of the\ndouble ve tor bundle D and denoted C . The ve tor bundle stru tures on D indu e a ommon\nD : D \u2192 B is the pullba k q ! C of\nve tor bundle stru ture on C with base M . The kernel of qB\nA\nD : D \u2192 A is q ! C . In pra ti e ores are\nthis ve tor bundle C a ross qA , and the kernel of qA\nB\noften identi\u001ced with stru tures whi h are not stri tly subsets of D and in su h ases we write\nc for the element of D whi h orresponds to a c \u2208 C .\nA morphism of double ve tor bundles from (D; A, B; M ) to (D \u2032 ; A\u2032 , B \u2032 ; M \u2032 ) is a quadruple\nof maps \u03c6 : D \u2192 D \u2032 , \u03c6A : A \u2192 A\u2032 , \u03c6B : B \u2192 B \u2032 and \u03c6M : M \u2192 M \u2032 su h that (\u03c6, \u03c6A ),\n(\u03c6, \u03c6B ), (\u03c6A , \u03c6M ) and (\u03c6B , \u03c6M ) are morphisms of ve tor bundles. A morphism of double\nve tor bundles indu es a morphism of the ores \u03c6C : C \u2192 C \u2032 by restri tion.\nRegarding D as an ordinary ve tor bundle over A, we denote the dual bundle by D B A.\n(This notation avoids problems with multiple subs ripts later.) In addition to its standard\nstru ture on base A, this has a ve tor bundle stru ture on base C \u2217 , the proje tion of whi h,\nA , is de\u001cned by\ndenoted \u03b3C\n\u2217\nh\u03b3CA\u2217 (\u03a6), ci = h\u03a6, e\n(3)\n0a + ci\nB\n\nD )\u22121 (a) \u2192 R, a \u2208 A , and c \u2208 C .

A proof is in [15, Chap. 9\u2104.\n\nTheorem 1.1 ([18, 3.1\u2104, [8, Thm. 16\u2104) There is a natural (up to sign) nondegenerate pairing between D B A \u2192 C \u2217 and D B B \u2192 C \u2217 given by\n\u03a6, \u03a8 = h\u03a6, di \u2212 hd, \u03a8i\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 D B A, \u03a8 \u2208 D B B have \u03b3CA\u2217 (\u03a6) = \u03b3CB\u2217 (\u03a8) and d is any element of D with\nD (d) = \u03b3 A (\u03a6) and q D (d) = \u03b3 B (\u03a8).\nqA\nA\nB\nB\nThe pairing on the LHS of (7) is over C \u2217 , whereas the pairings on the RHS are over A\nand B respe tively. The pairing indu es isomorphisms of double ve tor bundles\n\nZA : D B A \u2192 D B B B C \u2217 ,\nZB : D B B \u2192 D B A B C \u2217 ,\n\nhZA (\u03a6), \u03a8i = \u03a6, \u03a8 ,\n\n(8)\n\nhZB (\u03a8), \u03a6i = \u03a6, \u03a8\n\n(9)\n\nwith (ZA ) BC \u2217 = ZB . Note that ZB indu es the identity on both side bundles C \u2217 and B and\nis \u2212id on the ores A\u2217 , whereas ZA indu es the identity on the side bundles C \u2217 and the ores\nB \u2217 but is \u2212id on the side bundles A.\nThe example whi h follows is needed for \u009f4.\n\nExample 1.2\n\nGiven an ordinary ve tor bundle (A, q, M ) there is the tangent double ve tor\nbundle of Figure 1(b). This example was used as early as the 1960s to provide an e\u001e ient\nformalism for onne tion theory in A; see [1\u2104.

Dualizing the\nstru ture T A \u2192 T M gives a double ve tor bundle whi h we denote (T \u2022 A; A\u2217 , T M ; M ); this\nis anoni ally isomorphi to (T (A\u2217 ); A\u2217 , T M ; M ) under an isomorphism IA : T (A\u2217 ) \u2192 T \u2022 A\ngiven by\nhIA (X ), \u03bei = hhX , \u03beii\n(10)\nwhere X \u2208 T (A\u2217 ) and \u03be \u2208 T A have T (q\u2217 )(X ) = T (q)(\u03be), and hh , ii is the tangent pairing of\nT (A\u2217 ) and T A over T M de\u001cned by\n\nhhX , \u03beii =\n\nd\ndt h\u03c6t , at i 0 ,\n\nd\nd\n\u03c6t 0 and \u03be = dt\nat 0 .\nfor X = dt\nApplying 1.1 to D = T A thus indu es a pairing of T \u2217 A and T (A\u2217 ) over A\u2217 given by\n\n\u03a6, X = hhX , \u03beii \u2212 h\u03a6, \u03bei\nwhere \u03a6 \u2208 T \u2217 A and X \u2208 T (A\u2217 ) have r(\u03a6) = pA\u2217 (X ), and \u03be \u2208 T A is hosen so that T (q)(\u03be) =\nT (q\u2217 )(X ) and pA (\u03be) = cA (\u03a6). (Here cA is the proje tion of the standard otangent bundle\nand r : T \u2217 A \u2192 A\u2217 is a parti ular ase of (3).)

This R\npreserves the side bundles A and A\u2217 but indu es \u2212id : T \u2217 M \u2192 T \u2217 M as the map of ores. It\nis an antisymple tomorphism with respe t to the exa t symple ti stru tures.

These two double\notangents \u001ct together into a triple stru ture as in Figure 3(a). This stru ture is a triple\nve tor bundle in an obvious sense: ea h fa e is a double ve tor bundle and for ea h ve tor\nbundle stru ture on T \u2217 D , the maps de\u001cning the stru ture are morphisms of double ve tor\nbundles. The left and rear fa es of Figure 3(a) are the two otangent doubles of the two\nstru tures on D and the top fa e may be regarded as the otangent double of either of the\ntwo duals of D . (In all su h triple diagrams, we take the oblique arrows to be oming out of\nthe page.)\nFigure 3(a) is, in a sense made pre ise in [23\u2104, the verti al dual of the tangent prolongation\nof D as given in Figure 3(b). Five of the six fa es in 3(a) are double ve tor bundles of types\nonsidered already; it is only ne essary to verify that the top fa e is a double ve tor bundle.\nThe ores of the same \u001cve fa es are known, and we take the ore of the top fa e to be T \u2217 C .\nTaking these ores in opposite pairs, together with a parallel edge, then gives three double\nve tor bundles: the left and the right ores form (T \u2217 A; A, A\u2217 ; M ), the ba k and the front\nores form (T \u2217 B; B, B \u2217 ; M ) and the up and the down ores form (T \u2217 C; C, C \u2217 ; M ).

In the ase where D is the tangent of an ordinary ve tor\nbundle A, as in Figure 1(b), this is the orresponden e between linear ve tor \u001celds on A and\nlinear ve tor \u001celds on A\u2217 (see [15, \u009f3.4\u2104).\nNext, for any c \u2208 \u0393C , de\u001cne a ore se tion c \u2208 \u0393A D by\n\nProposition 2.2\n\ne\nc(a) = c(m) +\n0a .\nB\n\nThe verti al linear se tions (\u03be, X) and the ore se tions c for c \u2208 \u0393C ,\ngenerate \u0393A D as a C \u221e (A)\u0015module.\nProof.\n\nFirstly, given any X \u2208 \u0393B , there is a linear se tion (\u03be, X).

See [15, \u009f10.3\u2104. We need\nto prove orresponding equations with respe t to the bundle stru ture over C \u2217 . The fun tions\nD B A \u2192 R whi h are linear with respe t to the bundle stru ture over C \u2217 are determined by\narbitrary se tions of D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 . As in Proposition 2.2, these are of two types.\nFirstly, if X , Y \u2208 \u0393C \u2217 (D B A B C \u2217 ) are linear se tions, then X = \u03be \u2293 and Y = \u03b7 \u2293 for\nlinear se tions (\u03be, x), (\u03b7, y) \u2208 \u0393A D.\n\nLemma 2.5\n\nIf (\u03be, x) and (\u03b7, y) are linear se tions of D , then ([\u03be, \u03b7], [x, y]) is also.\n\nD to a se tion x, de\u001cne a se tion \u03be \u2295 \u03be of\nFor a se tion \u03be whi h proje ts under qB\nD \u2295B D \u2192 A \u2295M A by (\u03be \u2295 \u03be)(a1 \u2295 a2 ) = \u03be(a1 ) \u2295 \u03be(a2 ).

A derivation on\nE \u2192 M is a linear di\u001berential operator \u039b of order 6 1 for whi h there is a ve tor \u001celd X ,\ndepending on \u039b, su h that \u039b(f \u03bc) = f \u039b(\u03bc) + X(f )\u03bc for all f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and all se tions \u03bc\nof E . For any ve tor bundle E there is a ve tor bundle D(E) the se tions of whi h are the\nderivations, and with the an hor de\u001cned by \u039b 7\u2192 X and the usual bra ket, D(E) is a Lie\nalgebroid.

This de\u001cnes an automorphism D \u2192 D over A \u2192 A and therefore indu es a map of se tions tB : \u0393A D \u2192 \u0393A D ; the\nLie algebroid ondition then ensures that [tB (\u03be), tB (\u03b7)] = tB ([\u03be, \u03b7]) for all \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393A D .

Before giving the de\u001cnition, we\nneed some preliminaries.\nAgain onsider a double ve tor bundle as in Figure 1(a). We now assume that there are Lie\nalgebroid stru tures on all four sides and that ea h pair of parallel sides forms an L A \u0015ve tor\nbundle.\nDenote the four an hors by \u2206A : D \u2192 T A, \u2206B : D \u2192 T B, and b : B \u2192 T M, a : A \u2192\nT M . As usual we denote all four bra kets by [ , ]; the notation for elements will make lear\nwhi h stru ture we are using.\nThe an hors thus give morphisms of double ve tor bundles\n\n(\u2206A ; id, b; id) : (D; A, B; M ) \u2192 (T A; A, T M ; M ),\n(\u2206B ; a, id; id) : (D; A, B; M ) \u2192 (T B; T M, B; M )\nand so de\u001cne morphisms of their ores; denote these by \u2202A : C \u2192 A and \u2202B : C \u2192 B .\nFrom \u009f2 we know that D B A B C \u2217 is a Lie algebroid over C \u2217 . Likewise, the Lie algebroid\nstru ture on D \u2192 B indu es a Poisson stru ture on D BB whi h is linear over C \u2217 and therefore\nindu es a Lie algebroid stru ture on D B B B C \u2217 with base C \u2217 .\nThe bundles D B A B C \u2217 and D B B B C \u2217 are dual over C \u2217 under the pairing:\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(X ), Y i.\n(Y )i = hZB\n8X , Y 8 = hX , ZA\n\nDe\u001cnition 3.1 A double Lie algebroid is a double ve tor bundle as in Figure 1(a), equipped\nwith Lie algebroid stru tures on all four sides su h that ea h pair of parallel sides forms an\nL A \u0015ve tor bundle, and su h that the Lie algebroid stru tures on D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 and\nD B B B C \u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 form a Lie bialgebroid.\nIn pra ti e we will use ZA or ZB to transfer the Lie algebroid stru ture from, for example,\nD B B B C \u2217 to D B A.\nWe re all the notion of Lie bialgebroid, whi h was introdu ed in [26\u2104 as an abstra tion of\nthe in\u001cnitesimal stru ture of a Poisson groupoid [36\u2104. The onventions used here follow [15\u2104.\n\nDe\u001cnition 3.2\n\nLet A be a Lie algebroid on base M and suppose that A\u2217 is also equipped with\na stru ture of Lie algebroid. These stru tures onstitute a Lie bialgebroid if\nd\u2217 [X, Y ] = [d\u2217 X, Y ] + [X, d\u2217 Y ]\n\n(20)\n\nfor all X, Y \u2208 \u0393A.\nIn this de\u001cnition d\u2217 is the oboundary operator for A\u2217 and [ , ] is the S houten bra ket\nof multise tions of A. See [15\u2104, for example.\nA Lie bialgebra is a Lie bialgebroid for whi h M is a single point. For a Poisson manifold\nM , the otangent Lie algebroid stru ture on T \u2217 M makes (T \u2217 M, T M ) a Lie bialgebroid. The\nfollowing material, whi h is needed below, an be found in [26\u2104 and [15, Chapter 12\u2104.\n14\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nSuppose that (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid on base M and denote the an hors by a and a\u2217 .\n#\nThen we take the Poisson stru ture on M to be \u03c0M = a\u2217 \u25e6 a\u2217 . It follows that a is a Poisson\nmap (to the tangent lift Poisson stru ture on T M ; see below) and a\u2217 is anti\u0015Poisson.\nThe on ept of Lie bialgebroid is self\u0015dual: if (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid, then (A\u2217 , A) is\nalso ([26, 3.10\u2104, [9\u2104, or see [15\u2104). However (A\u2217 , A) will indu e on M the opposite of the Poisson\nstru ture indu ed by (A, A\u2217 ).\nIn this se tion we need the following morphism riterion for a Lie bialgebroid ([26, 6.2\u2104,\nor see [15, \u009f12.2\u2104).\n\nTheorem 3.3\n\nLet A be a Lie algebroid on M su h that its dual ve tor bundle A\u2217 also has a\nLie algebroid stru ture. Denote their an hors by a and a\u2217 .

For any Poisson manifold P there is a tangent lift Poisson stru ture on\nT P for whi h the an hor is given by\n\n\u03c0T#P = JP \u25e6 T (\u03c0P# ) \u25e6 \u0398\u22121\nP\n\n(22)\n\nwhere JP : T 2 P \u2192 T 2 P is the anoni al involution for the manifold P and \u0398P : T (T \u2217 P ) \u2192\nT \u2217 (T P ) was named the Tul zyjew di\u001beomorphism of P in [15, p.395\u2104 (\u0398 was denoted J \u2032 in\n[26\u2104).

The an hor is JM \u25e6T (a). See [26, 5.6\u2104 or [15, 10.3.14,\n9.7.1\u2104.\nWith these preliminaries established, onsider a double Lie algebroid (D; A, B; M ). We\nuse ZA to transfer the Lie algebroid stru ture from D BB BC \u2217 to D BA. From the morphism\nriterion, we know that\n\n\u03c0 #A \u25e6 R : T \u2217 (D B A B C \u2217 ) \u2192 T (D B A)\nis a morphism of Lie algebroids over e : D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 T C \u2217 . As with any Lie bialgebroid, it\nis also a morphism of double ve tor bundles, with the other side morphism being the identity\nof D B A and the ore morphism being e\u2217 : T \u2217 C \u2217 \u2192 D B A.\nFrom \u009f2 we know that e is a morphism of double ve tor bundles, namely of the two\nright\u0015hand fa es in Figure 4, over C \u2217 and b : B \u2192 T M .\n\nLemma 3.4\n\n\u2217 : A\u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 .\nThe ore of e : D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 T C \u2217 is \u2212\u2202A\n\n15\n\n\fK.

In the dualization pro ess, the two triple ve tor\nbundles in Figure 4 are inter hanged, but the positioning of the sides and ores is permuted.\nIn parti ular, the ores of the right\u0015hand fa es and of the front fa es are ex hanged. The map\nof the front ores indu ed by \u03c0 #A is \u2202A , by de\u001cnition.\n2\nProof.\n\nThe pro ess of dualizing a triple stru ture is overed in [23\u2104. Lemma 3.4 an also be proved\nby using (19).\nDualizing e over C \u2217 it follows that e\u2217 is a morphism of double ve tor bundles over C \u2217 and\n\u2212\u2202A , with ore morphism b\u2217 : T \u2217 M \u2192 B \u2217 .\nThe Poisson stru ture indu ed on C \u2217 by the Lie bialgebroid (D B A B C \u2217 , D B A) has\nasso iated an hor\n#\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u03c0C\n\u2217 = e\u2217 \u25e6 e : T C \u2192 T C,\nwhere e\u2217 : D BA \u2192 T C \u2217 is the an hor of D BA \u2192 C \u2217 . Denoting the an hor of D BB BC \u2217 \u2192 C \u2217\nby f , we have e\u2217 = f \u25e6 ZA . The arguments applied above to e apply equally to f and so\nf : D B B B C \u2217 \u2192 T C \u2217 is a morphism of double ve tor bundles over C \u2217 and \u2212a, with ore\n\u2217 . Thus \u03c0 # is a morphism of double ve tor bundles and therefore indu es on\nmorphism \u2212\u2202B\nC\u2217\nC the stru ture of a Lie algebroid, for whi h the an hor is the side morphism (\u2212a) \u25e6 (\u2212\u2202A ).\n#\n\u2217\n\u2217\nThe ore morphism for \u03c0C\n\u2217 is (\u2212\u2202B ) \u25e6 b . The skew\u0015symmetry of a Poisson an hor implies\nthat its ore morphism is the negative dual of its non\u0015identity side morphism, and so we have\na \u25e6 \u2202A = b \u25e6 \u2202B .\n\nProposition 3.5\n\nThe maps \u2202A : C \u2192 A and \u2202B : C \u2192 B are Lie algebroid morphisms.\n\nWe need two preparatory lemmas. The \u001crst is from [15, 10.3.6\u2104 and is proved by the same\nmethod as the se ond.\n\nLemma 3.6\n\nFor any Lie algebroid V on M, the bundle proje tion T \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 V is a morphism\nof Lie algebroids over the bundle proje tion V \u2217 \u2192 M.\n\nLemma 3.7\n\nThe proje tions D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 B and D B B B C \u2217 \u2192 A are morphisms of Lie\nalgebroids over the bundle proje tion C \u2217 \u2192 M .\nDenote the proje tions by Q : D B A B C \u2217 \u2192 C \u2217 and q : C \u2217 \u2192 M . The an hor\nondition b \u25e6 Q = T (q) \u25e6 f follows from the fa t that the Poisson an hor for D B A, namely\nT \u2217 (D B A) \u2192 T (D B A), is not only a morphism of double ve tor bundles, but a morphism of\ntriple ve tor bundles.\nSin e q is a surje tive submersion and Q is \u001cbrewise surje tive, it is su\u001e ient to he k that\nif X proje ts to x and Y proje ts to y , then [X , Y ] proje ts to [x, y]. By 2.2, it is su\u001e ient\nto onsider the ases of linear se tions and ore se tions.\nFor two linear se tions (\u03be, x) and (\u03b7, y) of D \u2192 A we have from the proof of Theorem 2.4\nthat [\u03be, \u03b7] is linear over [x, y] and [\u03be \u2293 , \u03b7 \u2293 ] = [\u03be, \u03b7]\u2293 . Likewise, for \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393A\u2217 , the ore se tions\nproje t to zero and [\u03c6, \u03c8] = 0 does also.\nLastly, for a linear se tion (\u03be, x) and \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393A\u2217 , we have from (19) that [\u03be \u2293 , \u03c6] is the ore\nse tion \u039b\u03be (\u03c6), and this proje ts to zero.\nThe result for D B B B C \u2217 \u2192 A is proved in the same way.\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nB\nProof of 3.5: As noted above, e : T C \u2192 D\nA is a morphism of double ve tor bundles\nProof.\n\nover C \u2217 and \u2212\u2202A : C \u2192 A. As for any Lie bialgebroid, e\u2217 is also a morphism of Lie algebroids\n16\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nover C \u2217 . Now the proje tion T \u2217 C \u2217 \u2192 C is a morphism of Lie algebroids, and the proje tion\nD BA \u2192 A is an anti\u0015morphism of Lie algebroids (be ause ZA is \u2212id on A). Both proje tions\nare surje tive submersions and so determine the Lie algebroid stru tures on their targets. It\nfollows that \u2212\u2202A is an anti\u0015morphism of Lie algebroids.\n2\nThe general pro ess used here, of quotienting a known morphism of Lie algebroids, is\nbased on the following result. A \u001cbration of Lie algebroids is a morphism \u03bd : A \u2192 A\u2032 over\np : M \u2192 M \u2032 su h that p is a surje tive submersion and \u03bd is \u001cbrewise surje tive.\n\nProposition 3.8\n\nConsider Lie algebroids A, A\u2032 and B on bases M, M \u2032 and N , and let\n\u03c6: A \u2192\n\u03c8 : A\u2032 \u2192 B and \u03bd : A \u2192 A\u2032 be morphisms of ve tor bundles over f, g and p,\nwith \u03c6 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03bd .\nIf \u03c6 is a morphism of Lie algebroids and \u03bd is a \u001cbration of Lie algebroids, then \u03c8 is a\nmorphism of Lie algebroids.\nA\u2032 ,\n\nThis follows from the general theory of quotients of Lie algebroids [15, \u009f4.4\u2104, but is easy\nto prove dire tly.\nObserve that Proposition 3.5 annot be proved by mapping se tions of C to ore se tions\nof D \u2192 A. In the ase of an L A \u0015ve tor bundle there is a simple relation (equation (18)),\nbut this does not hold for a general double Lie algebroid. This may be seen by onsidering\nthe iterated tangent bundle T 2 M = T (T M ) of any manifold; the bra ket of two verti al lift\nve tor \u001celds (whi h are the ore se tions in this ase) is always zero.\nThe next result, that the an hors \u2206A and \u2206B are morphisms of Lie algebroids with respe t\nto both stru tures, was taken as part of the de\u001cnition of a double Lie algebroid in [21\u2104. I am\ngrateful to Ted Voronov for having shown [35\u2104, using super methods, that it is a onsequen e\nof the other onditions in the de\u001cnition.

Next, v and T (\u03bd \u2032 )\nare \u001cbrations of Lie algebroids. That \u03bd \u2032 : D BA \u2192 A is a morphism over q\u2217 : C \u2217 \u2192 M follows\nfrom Lemma 3.7, and so its tangent prolongation is also. That \u03bd is a \u001cbration follows from\n3.6 by using D B A B C \u2217 \u223c\n= D B B and taking V = D \u2192 B .\nThe result now follows by Proposition 3.8.\n2\nIn the se tions whi h follow we onsider three lasses of examples of double Lie algebroids.\n\n\u009f 4 THE COTANGENT DOUBLE OF A LIE BIALGEBROID\nThe notion of Lie bialgebroid is re alled in the previous se tion.\nConsider a Lie algebroid A on M together with a Lie algebroid stru ture on the dual, not\na priori related to that on A. The stru ture on A\u2217 indu es a Poisson stru ture on A, and this\ngives rise to a otangent Lie algebroid T \u2217 A \u2192 A. Equally, the Lie algebroid stru ture on A\nindu es a Poisson stru ture on A\u2217 and this gives rise to a otangent Lie algebroid T \u2217 A\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 .\nWe transfer this latter stru ture to T \u2217 A \u2192 A\u2217 via R. There are now Lie algebroid stru tures\non ea h of the four sides of the double ve tor bundle D = T \u2217 A of Figure 6(a).\n\nTheorem 4.1\n\nLet A be a Lie algebroid on M su h that its dual ve tor bundle A\u2217 also has a\nLie algebroid stru ture. Then (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid if and only if D = T \u2217 A, with the\nstru tures just des ribed, is a double Lie algebroid.\nFirst assume merely that A\u2217 is a Lie algebroid. Consider Figure 1( ) with the\norresponding Lie algebroid stru tures on the horizontal sides.\n\nProof.\n\nLemma 4.2\nbundle.\n\nFigure 1( ) with the Lie algebroid stru tures just des ribed, is an L A \u0015ve tor\n\nIt must be proved that the ve tor bundle operations are Lie algebroid morphisms.\nThat the bundle proje tion T \u2217 A \u2192 A\u2217 is a Lie algebroid morphism follows from Lemma 3.6.\nThat the addition map is a Lie algebroid morphism follows from the fa t that \u03b4l\u03c6 +\n\u03b4l\u03c8 =\nA\n\u03b4l\u03c6+\u03c8 for \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393A\u2217 . The other onditions are similar.\n2\nProof.\n\nNow assume that (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid. The verti al stru ture on D is the otangent\nLie algebroid stru ture for the Poisson stru ture on A. Dualizing over A we have Figure 6(b)\nand the Poisson stru ture on T A is the tangent lift of the Poisson stru ture on A. By \u009f2 this\nPoisson stru ture is also linear over T M . The dual D BA BT M is shown in Figure 6( ). The\nmap IA : T (A\u2217 ) \u2192 T \u2022 A des ribed in Example 1.2 is an isomorphism of double ve tor bundles\nto (T (A\u2217 ); A\u2217 , T M ; M ) and by [15, 10.3.14\u2104 it is an isomorphism of Lie algebroids over T M\nto the tangent prolongation of A\u2217 \u2192 M .\nNow onsider the horizontal Lie algebroid stru ture in Figure 6(a). This was transported\nvia R from the otangent Lie algebroid of A\u2217 . By the same argument as in the verti al ase,\nthe indu ed Lie algebroid stru ture on D BA\u2217 BT M \u223c\n= T A \u2192 T M is isomorphi to the tangent\nprolongation Lie algebroid of A \u2192 M .\nWe must now prove that :\n\nProposition 4.3\n\npair\n\n(T A, T \u2022 A)\n\nFor (A, A\u2217 ) a Lie bialgebroid on M , and the stru tures just des ribed, the\nis a Lie bialgebroid on T M .\n18\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nT \u2217A\n\n/ A\u2217\n\nTA\n\n/ TM\n\nT \u2022A\n\n/ TM\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nA\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n( )\n\nFigure 6.\nProof.\n\nWe use the morphism riterion 3.3.

C. H. Ma kenzie\n\nThis result provided a hara terization of the notion of Lie bialgebra in terms of a single\nLie algebra stru ture on d, the onditions being expressed in terms of the simple notion of\npairing. It also demonstrated, as a simple onsequen e, that the notion of Lie bialgebra is\nself\u0015dual: (g, g\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebra if and only if (g\u2217 , g) is so.\nFor Lie bialgebroids, Kosmann\u0015S hwarzba h [9\u2104 gave an elegant proof of self\u0015duality, in\nterms of her riterion that (A, A\u2217 ) is a Lie bialgebroid if and only if the oboundary of one\nstru ture is a derivation of the S houten bra ket of the other.\nFor a Lie bialgebra (g, g\u2217 ), the stru ture of the otangent double Lie algebroid T \u2217 g \u223c\n= g\u00d7g\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nequips T g with Lie algebroid stru tures on bases g and g . These are the a tion Lie algebroids\nde\u001cned by the oadjoint a tions of g and g\u2217 on ea h other. We show in \u009f5 that a double Lie\nalgebroid (D; A, B.M ) for whi h the ore is trivial \u0016 as is the ase for D = T \u2217 g \u0016 has a\nthird Lie algebroid stru ture, on base M . In the ase of T \u2217 g, M is a point and this third\nstru ture is the Drinfel'd double Lie algebra.\nDespite the di\u001beren es, it seems legitimate to regard Theorem 4.1 as a generalization of\nthe Manin triple theorem, sin e it provides a riterion, in terms of a notion of double, for Lie\nalgebroid stru tures on a pair of dual bundles to onstitute a Lie bialgebroid.\nIn [11\u2104, Liu, Weinstein and Xu pla e a bra ket stru ture on A \u2295 A\u2217 , where (A, A\u2217 ) is a\nLie bialgebroid, whi h is a dire t generalization of the Lie algebra stru ture of the Drinfel'd\ndouble, and they prove a dire t generalization of the Manin triple theorem. This is not a\nLie algebroid stru ture, but a Courant algebroid, a ve tor bundle with a bra ket stru ture in\nwhi h the Ja obi and Leibniz identities do not ne essarily hold. Whereas the otangent double\nhas two simple stru tures whi h intera t in a nontrivial way, the single bra ket stru ture on\nA \u2295 A\u2217 of [11\u2104 is less well\u0015behaved but embodies the whole stru ture.\nThe notion of Courant algebroid has been developed in work on Dira stru tures and\ngeneralized omplex geometry. On the other hand, the notion of double Lie algebroid abstra ts\niterated and se ond\u0015order onstru tions in di\u001berential geometry (see parti ularly \u009f6), and\nprovides a general setting for duality phenomena. In parti ular, there is a lear global form\nof the notion of double Lie algebroid.\nAnother important property of the lassi al Drinfel'd double is that g \u22b2\u22b3 g\u2217 itself has a\nnatural stru ture of Lie bialgebra. A double form of this result will be given in [25\u2104.\n\n\u009f 5 MATCHED PAIRS AND VACANT DOUBLE LIE ALGEBROIDS\nA brief history of mat hed pairs of Lie algebras was given in the Introdu tion. The orresponding on ept of a mat hed pair of Lie groups [14\u2104, [28\u2104 was extended to Lie groupoids\nin [16\u2104. In [31\u2104, Mokri di\u001berentiated the twisted automorphism equations of [16\u2104 to obtain\nonditions on a pair of Lie algebroid representations, of A on B and of B on A, whi h ensure\nthat the dire t sum ve tor bundle A \u2295 B has a Lie algebroid stru ture with A and B as\nsubalgebroids.

This is a dire t analogue of the de\u001cnition of\nB\nva an y for double Lie groupoids and for L A \u0015groupoids [16, 2.11, 4.10\u2104.\nConsider a va ant double Lie algebroid (D; A, B; M ). Note that D \u2192 A and D \u2192 B are\n! B and q ! A. The dual D B A \u2192 C \u2217 is the Whitney sum A \u2295 B \u2217 .

Namely, ea h se tion Y of B indu es the pullba k se tion 1 \u2297 Y of qA\nindu es a ve tor \u001celd \u03b7(Y ) = \u2206A (1 \u2297 Y ) on A, where \u2206A : D \u2192 T A is the an hor of the\nverti al stru ture. Sin e the an hor is a morphism of double ve tor bundles, \u03b7(Y ) is linear\nover the ve tor \u001celd b(Y ) on M , in the sense of [15, \u009f3.4\u2104; that is, \u03b7(Y ) is a ve tor bundle\n(\u2217)\nmorphism A \u2192 T A over b(Y ) : M \u2192 T M . It follows that \u03b7(Y ) de\u001cnes derivations \u03c3Y on\nA\u2217 and \u03c3Y on A by\n\n\u03b7(Y )(l\u03c6 ) = l\u03c3(\u2217) (\u03c6) ,\nY\n\n(\u2217)\n\nh\u03c6, \u03c3Y (X)i = b(Y )h\u03c6, Xi \u2212 h\u03c3Y (\u03c6), Xi\n\n(28)\n\nD\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393A\u2217 , X \u2208 \u0393A, and l\u03c6 denotes the fun tion A \u2192 R, X 7\u2192 h\u03c6(qA X), Xi. Sin e qA\nis a Lie algebroid morphism, it follows that \u03c3 is a representation of B on the ve tor bundle\nA, with ontragredient representation \u03c3 (\u2217) . We will use both \u03c3 and \u03c3 (\u2217) in what follows.\nD is a morphism of Lie algebroids over q and for ea h X \u2208 \u0393A we obtain a\nLikewise, qA\nB\n(\u2217)\nlinear ve tor \u001celd \u03be(X) \u2208 X (B) over a(X). We de\u001cne derivations \u03c1X on B \u2217 and \u03c1X on B by\n\n\u03be(X)(l\u03c8 ) = l\u03c1(\u2217) (\u03c8) ,\nX\n\n(\u2217)\n\nh\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y )i = a(X)h\u03c8, Y i \u2212 h\u03c1X (\u03c8), Y i.\n\n(29)\n\nAgain, \u03c1(\u2217) and \u03c1 are representations of A.\nThe two Lie algebroid stru tures on D are a tion Lie algebroids determined by the a tions\nY 7\u2192 \u03b7(Y ) and X 7\u2192 \u03be(X) [15, \u009f4.1\u2104. It therefore follows that the dual Poisson stru tures are\nsemi\u0015dire t, but we need to prove this dire tly.

It follows from (19) that\n[\u03c61 \u2295 0, \u03c62 \u2295 0] = 0 \u2295 0.\nThe se ond equation in (19) is [\u03be \u2293 , \u03c6] = \u039b\u03be (\u03c6). Comparing (17) with (28), we have\n(\u2217)\n\u039b = \u03c3 (\u2217) . So [0 \u2295 Y, \u03c6 \u2295 0] = \u03c3Y (\u03c6) \u2295 0 and this ompletes the proof of (30).\nFor (31) apply (19) to D BB BC \u2217 = A \u2295 B \u2217 and transport the stru ture to D BA = A \u2295 B \u2217\nby ZA (X, \u03c8) = (\u2212X, \u03c8).\n2\nThus A\u2217 \u2295 B is the semi\u0015dire t produ t A\u2217 \u22ca B of B with the ve tor bundle A\u2217 with\nrespe t to \u03c3 (\u2217) . (This is the simple semi\u0015dire t produ t of two Lie algebroids on the same\nbase, as in [15, p.270\u2104.) We denote the stru ture on A \u2295 B \u2217 by Aop \u22c9 B \u2217 .\n\nTheorem 5.5 Let (D; A, B; M ) be a va ant double Lie algebroid. Then the two Lie algebroid\nstru tures on D are a tion Lie algebroids orresponding to a tions whi h de\u001cne representations\n\u03c1, of A on B , and \u03c3 , of B on A, with respe t to whi h A and B form a mat hed pair.\nConversely, let A and B be a mat hed pair of Lie algebroids with respe t to representations\n\u03c1 and \u03c3 . Then the a tion of A on qB indu ed by \u03c1 and the a tion of B on qA indu ed by \u03c3\nde\u001cne Lie algebroid stru tures on D = A \u00d7M B with respe t to whi h (D; A, B; M ) is a va ant\ndouble Lie algebroid.\nWe \u001crst need to prove the three equations (1). We start by applying the bialgebroid\nondition to E = A\u2217 \u22ca B and E \u2217 = Aop \u22c9 B \u2217 . We use the dual form of (20), whi h in this\nase is :\n\nProof.\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\ndE [\u03c61 \u2295 Y1 , \u03c62 \u2295 Y2 ] = [dE (\u03c61 \u2295 Y1 ), \u03c62 \u2295 Y2 ] + [\u03c61 \u2295 Y1 , dE\u2217 (\u03c62 \u2295 Y2 )]\n\n(32)\n\nfor all \u03c61 \u2295 Y1 , \u03c62 \u2295 Y2 \u2208 \u0393E . By repla ing \u03c62 \u2295 Y2 by f \u03c62 \u2295 f Y2 , for f \u2208 C \u221e (M ), and\nexpanding out, we \u001cnd, as in [15, p.449\u2104, that\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\ndE [\u03c6 \u2295 Y, f ] = [dE (\u03c6 \u2295 Y ), f ] + [\u03c6 \u2295 Y, dE\u2217 (f )].\n\n(33)\n(\u2217)\n\nNow dE\u2217 (f ) = \u2212dA f \u2295 0. So, for the last term, we have [\u03c6 \u2295 Y, dE\u2217 (f )] = \u2212\u03c3Y (dA f ) \u2295 0,\nand pairing this with any X \u2295 \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393E \u2217 . we have\n\nh[\u03c6 \u2295 Y, dE\u2217 (f )], X \u2295 \u03c8i = a(\u03c3Y (X))(f ) \u2212 b(Y )(a(X)(f )).\n24\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nOn the LHS, [\u03c6 \u2295 Y, f ] = e(\u03c6 \u2295 Y )(f ) = b(Y )(f ) and so, pairing with X \u2295 \u03c8 gives\n\u2217\n\nhdE (b(Y )(f )), X \u2295 \u03c8i = e\u2217 (X \u2295 \u03c8)(b(Y )(f )) = \u2212a(X)(b(Y )(f )).\nConsider the \u001crst term on the RHS of (33). For any \u03be \u2208 \u0393\u039b2 (E) we have [\u03be, f ] = \u2212\u03b9df (\u03be),\n[15, 12.1.4\u2104, so pairing with X \u2295 \u03c8 gives\n\nh[\u03be, f ], X \u2295 \u03c8i = \u2212\u03be(df, X \u2295 \u03c8).\nWe need the following lemma, whi h is a straightforward al ulation.\n\nLemma 5.6\n\u2217\n\ndE (\u03c6 \u2295 Y )(X1 \u2295 \u03c81 , X2 \u2295 \u03c82 ) = \u2212(dA \u03c6)(X1 , X2 ) + h\u03c81 , \u03c1X2 (Y )i \u2212 h\u03c82 , \u03c1X1 (Y )i.\n2\nFor the \u001crst term on the RHS of (33). we therefore have\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nh[dE (\u03c6 \u2295 Y ), f ], X \u2295 \u03c8i = \u2212dE (\u03c6 \u2295 Y )(dE f, X \u2295 \u03c8) =\n\u2212 hdB f, \u03c1X (Y )i = \u2212b(\u03c1X (Y ))(f ).\nusing dE f = 0 \u2295 dB f. Putting these together, (33) be omes\n\n\u2212a(X)(b(Y )(f )) = \u2212b(\u03c1X (Y ))(f ) + a(\u03c3Y (X))(f ) \u2212 b(Y )(a(X)(f )),\nwhi h proves the third equation in (1).\nNow return to the bialgebroid equation (32). Set \u03c61 = \u03c62 = 0, so that we have\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\ndE [0 \u2295 Y1 , 0 \u2295 Y2 ] = [dE (0 \u2295 Y1 ), 0 \u2295 Y2 ] + [0 \u2295 Y1 , dE\u2217 (0 \u2295 Y2 )]\n\n(34)\n\nand evaluate this at (0 \u2295 \u03c8) \u2227 (X \u2295 0). The LHS of (34) is easily seen to be h\u03c8, \u03c1X [Y2 , Y1 ]i.\nOn the RHS, onsider the se ond term \u001crst. Writing the bra ket as the Lie derivative of\n\u2217\nthe multise tion dE (0 \u2295 Y2 ) with respe t to 0 \u2295 Y1 , we have\n\u2217\n\nhL0\u2295Y1 (dE (0 \u2295 Y2 )), (0 \u2295 \u03c8) \u2227 (X \u2295 0)i\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n= L0\u2295Y1 hdE (0 \u2295 Y2 ), (0 \u2295 \u03c8) \u2227 (X \u2295 0)i \u2212 hdE (0 \u2295 Y2 ), L0\u2295Y1 ((0 \u2295 \u03c8) \u2227 (X \u2295 0))i\n\n(35)\n\n\u2217\n\nIn the \u001crst term, dE (0 \u2295 Y2 )(0 \u2295 \u03c8, X \u2295 0) = h\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y2 )i, and e(0 \u2295 Y1 ) = b(Y1 ), so we have\nb(Y1 )h\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y2 )i.\nFor the se ond term, note \u001crst that L0\u2295Y (0\u2295\u03c8) = 0\u2295LY (\u03c8) and L0\u2295Y (X\u22950) = \u03c3Y (X)\u22950.\nUsing these, the se ond term on the RHS of (35) is\n\nhLY1 (\u03c8), \u03c1X (Y2 )i + h\u03c8, \u03c1\u03c3Y1 (X) (Y2 )i.\nCal ulating the \u001crst term on the RHS of (34) in the same way, we have\n\nh\u03c8, \u03c1X [Y2 , Y1 ]i = \u2212b(Y2 )h\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y1 )i + hLY2 (\u03c8), \u03c1X (Y1 )i + h\u03c8, \u03c1\u03c3Y2 (X) (Y1 )i\n+ b(Y1 )h\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y2 )i \u2212 hLY1 (\u03c8), \u03c1X (Y2 )i \u2212 h\u03c8, \u03c1\u03c3Y1 (X) (Y2 )i.\n25\n\n\fK. C. H. Ma kenzie\n\nFinally, b(Y1 )h\u03c8, \u03c1X (Y2 )i \u2212 hLY1 (\u03c8), \u03c1X (Y2 )i = h\u03c8, [Y1 , \u03c1X (Y2 )]i and we have the \u001crst equation of (1). The se ond equation is proved in the same way.\nNow onsider the se ond part of 5.5. It is straightforward to prove that (A\u00d7M B; A, B; M ),\nwith the a tion Lie algebroid stru tures on A\u00d7M B , is an L A \u0015ve tor bundle both horizontally\nand verti ally. We must verify the bialgebroid ondition (32).\nFirstly, (34) at (0 \u2295 \u03c8) \u2227 (X \u2295 0) an be proved by reversing the argument above. The ase\nof any (X1 \u2295\u03c81 , X2 \u2295\u03c82 ) = (X1 \u22950, 0\u2295\u03c82 )+(0\u2295\u03c81 , X2 \u22950) follows from the skew\u0015symmetry\nof all the terms. Thus (34) holds.\nFor (32) with Y1 = Y2 = 0 and any arguments, it is straightforward to see that all terms\nare identi ally zero. It remains to onsider (32) with \u03c61 = 0, Y2 = 0. For the LHS we have\n(\u2217)\n\n\u2217\n\ndE [0 \u2295 Y, \u03c6 \u2295 0] = \u2212dA (\u03c3Y (\u03c6)) \u2295 0.\n(\u2217)\n\nExpanding out \u2212dA (\u03c3Y (\u03c6))(X1 , X2 ) we have\n\n\u2212 a(X1 )b(Y )h\u03c6, X2 i + a(X1 )h\u03c6, \u03c3Y (X2 )i + a(X2 )b(Y )h\u03c6, X1 i\n\u2212 a(X2 )h\u03c6, \u03c3Y (X1 )i + b(Y )h\u03c6, [X1 , X2 ]i \u2212 h\u03c6, \u03c3Y ([X1 , X2 ])i. (36)\n(\u2217)\n\n\u2217\n\nOn the RHS the se ond term is [0\u2295Y, dE (\u03c6\u22950)] = [0\u2295Y, \u2212dA \u03c6\u22950] = \u2212\u03c3Y (dA \u03c6)\u22950, using\n(\u2217)\n(\u2217)\n5.6 and (30), and extending \u03c3Y to the exterior square. Expanding out h\u2212\u03c3Y (dA \u03c6), X1 \u2227X2 i,\nwe have\n\n\u2212 b(Y )a(X1 )h\u03c6, X2 i + b(Y )a(X2 )h\u03c6, X1 i + b(Y )h\u03c6, [X1 , X2 ]i\n+ a(\u03c3Y (X1 ))h\u03c6, X2 i \u2212 a(X2 )h\u03c6, \u03c3Y (X1 )i \u2212 h\u03c6, [\u03c3Y (X1 ), X2 ]i\n+ a(X1 )h\u03c6, \u03c3Y (X2 )i \u2212 a(\u03c3Y (X2 ))h\u03c6, X1 i \u2212 h\u03c6, [X1 , \u03c3Y (X2 )]i. (37)\nThe \u001crst term on the RHS, evaluated at F1 \u2227 F2 \u2208 \u0393\u039b2 (E \u2217 ), is\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nh[dE (0 \u2295 Y ), \u03c6 \u2295 0], F1 \u2227 F2 i = h\u2212L\u03c6\u22950 (dE (0 \u2295 Y )), F1 \u2227 F2 i\n\u2217\n\n= hdE (0 \u2295 Y ), L\u03c6\u22950 (F1 \u2227 F2 )i,\n\n(38)\n\nsin e e(\u03c6 \u2295 0) = 0. Now L\u03c6\u22950 (X \u2295 \u03c8) = 0 \u2295 \u03b8\u03c6,X where \u03b8\u03c6,X \u2208 B \u2217 is the element su h that\n(\u2217)\n\nhZ, \u03b8\u03c6,X i = h\u03c3Z (\u03c6), Xi\nfor all Z \u2208 B. Put Fi = Xi \u2295 \u03c8i in (38) and write \u03b8i = \u03b8\u03c6,Xi .

The proof of\nTheorem 5.5 is omplete.\n2\nIn the pro ess we have also proved the following result.\n26\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nCorollary 5.7\n\nLet A and B be Lie algebroids on the same base M , and let \u03c1 : A \u2192 D(B)\nand \u03c3 : B \u2192 D(A) be representations on the ve tor bundles underlying B and A.\nThen A, B , \u03c1, \u03c3 form a mat hed pair if and only if (A\u2217 \u22ca B, Aop \u22c9 B \u2217 ), with the Lie\nalgebroid stru tures des ribed in 5.4, is a Lie bialgebroid.\nThus the three mat hed pair equations in (1) are embodied in the bialgebroid equation\n(32). Theorem 5.5 a tually shows the equivalen e of three formulations: a va ant double Lie\nalgebroid stru ture with sides A and B is equivalent to a mat hed pair stru ture on (A, B),\nwhi h in turn is equivalent to a Lie bialgebroid stru ture on (A\u2217 \u22ca B, Aop \u22c9 B \u2217 ) of the type\nin 5.4. We thus have a diagrammati hara terization of mat hed pairs of Lie algebroids:\nre all that the hara terization 3.3 of a Lie bialgebroid is formulated entirely in terms of the\nPoisson tensor and the anoni al isomorphism R. Thus 5.5 provides a de\u001cnition of mat hed\npair whi h an be formulated more generally in a ategory possessing pullba ks and suitable\nadditive stru ture. The orresponding hara terization of mat hed pairs of Lie groupoids in\nterms of va ant double Lie groupoids is in [16, \u009f2\u2104.\nGiven a va ant double Lie algebroid (D; A, B; M ) the Lie algebroid stru ture A \u22b2\u22b3 B on\nD \u2192 M may be alled a diagonal stru ture by analogy with the groupoid ase.\nForms of Corollary 5.7 in the Lie algebra ase have been found by Majid [29, \u009f8.3\u2104 and in\nthe setting of Lie\u0015Rinehart algebras by Huebs hmann [7\u2104.\nIn the ase of a Lie bialgebra (g, g\u2217 ), the Lie bialgebroid asso iated to the va ant double\nLie algebroid is (g \u2295 g0 , g\u2217 \u2295 g\u22170 ) where the subs ripts denote the abelianizations. This is of\nourse onsistent with 4.1 in the bialgebra ase \u0016 whi h is both a bialgebroid and a mat hed\npair.\n\n\u009f 6 THE DOUBLE LIE ALGEBROID OF A DOUBLE LIE GROUPOID\nDe\u001cnition 3.1 of a double Lie algebroid arose from work on the double Lie algebroid of a\ndouble Lie groupoid, as onstru ted in [16\u2104, [20\u2104. Some of what is required in order to verify\nthat the double Lie algebroid of a double Lie groupoid does satisfy 3.1 has been given in [18\u2104,\nand we re all the details brie\u001dy.\nFirst we re all the notion of double Lie groupoid (see [16\u2104 and referen es given there).\nA double Lie groupoid onsists of a manifold S equipped with two Lie groupoid stru tures\non bases H and V , ea h of whi h is a Lie groupoid on base M , su h that the stru ture\nmaps (sour e, target, multipli ation, identity, inversion) of ea h groupoid stru ture on S\nare morphisms with respe t to the other, and su h that the double sour e map \u03b12 : S \u2192\nH \u00d7M V, s 7\u2192 (e\n\u03b1V (s), \u03b1\neH (s)) is a surje tive submersion; see Figure 7(a). One should think\nof elements of S as squares, the horizontal edges of whi h ome from H , the verti al edges\nfrom V , and the orner points from M .\nConsider a double Lie groupoid (S; H, V ; M ) as in Figure 7(a). Applying the Lie fun tor\nto the verti al stru ture S \u21d2 H gives a Lie algebroid AV S \u2192 H whi h also has a groupoid\nstru ture over AV obtained by applying the Lie fun tor to the stru ture maps of S \u21d2 V ;\nthis is the verti al L A \u0015groupoid of S [16, \u009f4\u2104, as in Figure 7(b). We re all the notion of\nL A \u0015groupoid from [16\u2104.\n\nDe\u001cnition 6.1\n\nAn L A \u0015groupoid is a manifold \u03a9 equipped with a Lie groupoid stru ture on\na base A, whi h is a Lie algebroid on a base M , and a Lie algebroid stru ture on a base G,\n27\n\n\fK.

Reversing the order of these operations, one de\u001cnes \u001crst the horizontal\nL A \u0015groupoid (AH S; AH, V ; M ) and then takes the Lie algebroid A2 S = A(AH S). The\nanoni al involution JS : T 2 S \u2192 T 2 S then restri ts to an isomorphism of double ve tor bundles JeS : A2 S \u2192 A2 S and allows the Lie algebroid stru ture on A2 S \u2192 AV to be transported\nto A2 S \u2192 AV . Thus A2 S is a double ve tor bundle equipped with four Lie algebroid stru tures; in [20\u2104 we alled this the double Lie algebroid of S . The ore of both double ve tor\nbundles A2 S and A2 S is AK , the Lie algebroid of the ore groupoid K \u21d2 M of S [20, 1.6\u2104.\n\nTheorem 6.2\n\nWith the stru tures just de\u001cned, (A2 S; AH, AV ; M ) is a double Lie algebroid.\n\nProof. Write D = A2 S . The stru ture maps for the horizontal ve tor bundle A2 S \u2192 AV are\nobtained by applying the Lie fun tor to the stru ture maps of AH S \u2192 V and are therefore Lie\nalgebroid morphisms with respe t to the verti al Lie algebroid stru tures. The orresponding\nstatement is true for the verti al ve tor bundle A2 S \u2192 AH and this is transported by JeS to\nA2 S \u2192 AH . Thus the \u001crst ondition of 3.1 is satis\u001ced.\nNow onsider the bialgebroid ondition. We \u001crst need to identify the Lie algebroid stru tures on A2 S B AH B A\u2217 K and A2 S B AV B A\u2217 K . From [18\u2104 we know that A\u2217V S \u21d2 A\u2217 K is\na Poisson groupoid, and therefore (A(A\u2217V S), A\u2217 (A\u2217V S)) is a Lie bialgebroid. To relate these\nstru tures, we need to re all the duality of V B \u0015groupoids.\nConsider any V B \u0015groupoid as in Figure 8(a), with ore ve tor bundle L \u2192 M . Taking the\ndual in the sense of V B \u0015groupoids [32\u2104, [15, \u009f11.2\u2104, we have the V B \u0015groupoid (\u03a9\u2217 ; G, L\u2217 ; M )\nas in Figure 8(b).\nThe pairing of \u03a9 and \u03a9\u2217 is a Lie groupoid morphism \u03a9\u00d7G \u03a9\u2217 \u2192 R and the indu ed pairing\nhh , ii = A(h , i) of the Lie algebroids is also non\u0015degenerate and respe ts the double ve tor\nbundle stru tures [15, \u009f11.5\u2104. It therefore indu es an isomorphism of double ve tor bundles\n\nI\u03a9 : A(\u03a9\u2217 ) \u2192 A\u03a9 B AG\nwhi h preserves both side bundles and the ore. Write IeV and IeH for this map when \u03a9 = AV S\nand \u03a9 = AH S. Composing the inverse of JeS B AH with IeV gives an isomorphism\n\ne H = (JeS B AH)\u22121 \u25e6 IeV : A(A\u2217V S) \u2192 A2 S B AH.\n\u0398\n28\n\n(39)\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\n\u03a9\n\n// A\n\n\u03a9\u2217\n\n// L \u2217\n\nA(\u03a9\u2217 )\n\n/ L\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n// M\n\nG\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n// M\n\nAG\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/M\n\nG\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n( )\n\nFigure 8.\n\ne H BA\u2217 K : A2 S BAH BA\u2217 K \u2192 A\u2217 (A\u2217 S) and to prove that\nDualizing this over A\u2217 K we get \u0398\nV\ne H is a Poisson map.\nthis is an isomorphism of Lie algebroids it it su\u001e ient to prove that \u0398\nOn the other hand, onsider IeH : A(A\u2217H S) \u2192 A2 S B AV .

However the Poisson stru ture on A2 S BAV is the dual of the Lie algebroid\nstru ture on A2 S \u2192 AH and this is obtained from the Lie algebroid stru ture on A2 S \u2192 AH ,\ne V , de\u001cned by\ntransported by JeS .

We re all the\nde\u001cnition.\nThe otangent groupoid of the groupoid S \u21d2 H is T \u2217 S \u21d2 A\u2217V S . This is a symple ti\ngroupoid and so the indu ed map (\u03b4\u03bd)# : T \u2217 T \u2217 S \u2192 T T \u2217 S is an isomorphism of Lie groupoids\nas shown in Figure 10(b), where a\u2217 denotes the an hor for the Lie algebroid stru ture on\nA\u2217V T \u2217 S \u2192 A\u2217V S.\n\nA\u2217V T \u2217 S\n\n\u000f\n\n// A\u2217 T \u2217 K\n\nT A\u2217V S\n\n\u000f\n\nA\u2217V S\n\n//\n\nA\u2217V S\n\nA\u2217 K\n\n\u000f\n\n// T A\u2217 K\n\nA\u2217V T S\n\n\u000f\n\nA\u2217V S\n\n//\n\n(a)\n\nA\u2217 K\n\n(b)\n\n//\n\n\u000f\n\nA\u2217 T K\n\n//\n\n\u000f\n\nA\u2217 K\n\n( )\n\nFigure 11.\nThis a\u2217 is itself a morphism of double stru tures (indeed, of triple stru tures); the domain\nand target are shown in Figures 11(a) and (b). The V B \u0015groupoid (a) arises by taking the\nverti al Lie algebroid of the double Lie groupoid (T \u2217 S; A\u2217V S, A\u2217H S; A\u2217 K) and then dualizing;\nit has ore A\u2217 (A\u2217H S). The V B \u0015groupoid (b) is the tangent of A\u2217V S \u21d2 A\u2217 K and so has ore\nA(A\u2217V S). We de\u001cne \u039bH to be the ore map of a\u2217 . The de\u001cnition of \u039bV is similar.\nBoth RT S and \u0398S are also groupoid morphisms. For any V B \u0015groupoid (\u03a9; G, A; M ), R\u03a9\nis a groupoid morphism over R\u03a9 : A\u2217 \u03a9\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 \u03a9 [15, 11.5.14\u2104. In parti ular, RT S is a Lie\ngroupoid morphism over RT S/T H : A\u2217V T \u2217 S \u2192 A\u2217V T S where the subs ript indi ates that R\nrefers to the V B \u0015groupoid (T S; T H, S; H).\nSimilarly, \u0398S is a groupoid morphism over \u03b8S/H : T A\u2217V S \u2192 A\u2217V T S [15, 11.5.11\u2104. From\nthe ommutativity of Figure 10(a), it follows that\n\n\u03b8S/H \u25e6 a\u2217 = RT S/T H .\n30\n\n\fEhresmann doubles and Drinfel'd doubles\n\nIt further follows that the ore maps of \u03b8S/H , a\u2217 and RT S/T H ommute. The ore map of a\u2217\nis \u039bH by de\u001cnition. To see the ore of Figure 11( ), onsider the triple stru ture in Figure\n12(a). The ore of the top fa e here is AV AH S = A2 S and the ore of the bottom fa e is AH .\nTaking the dual of AV T S over T H produ es the triple stru ture shown in Figure 12(b). The\nbundle A2 S \u2192 AH of the top and bottom ores of (a) is parallel to the axis of dualization and\nso the bundle of top and bottom ores of (b) is A2 S B AH \u2192 AH . The pro ess of dualizing\na triple ve tor bundle is des ribed in detail in [23\u2104 and the modi\u001c ations to take a ount of\ngroupoid stru tures are straightforward.\n\nAV T SK\n\nKKK\nKK%\n\n//\n\n\u000f\n\nT H LL\nLLL\nLL& \u000f\nH\n\nIII\nIII\nI$\n\nHH\nHH\nH$\n//\nAV\n\nAV S\n\n//\n\nA\u2217V T S\n\nAT VH\n\n\u000f\n// T M J\nJJJ\nJJ \u000f\n$\n// M\n\nIII\nIII\nI$\n// A\u2217 K\n\nA\u2217V S\n\n\u000f\n\n//\n\nT H KK\n\nKKK\nKKK\n% \u000f\n\nH\n\n(a)\n\nA\u2217 T KI\n\n\u000f\n\nT M KK\n\nKKK\nKKK\n% \u000f\n// M\n\n(b)\nFigure 12.\n\neH and the ore map of \u03b8S/H is\nIt is routine to verify that the ore map of RT S/T H is R\ne H . This proves the ommutativity of the upper triangle in Figure 9(a). The proof for (b) is\n\u0398\nsimilar.\nNow RT S : T \u2217 T \u2217 S \u2192 T \u2217 T S is an antisymple tomorphism and so RT S/T H is anti\u0015Poisson\n[15, 11.5.16\u2104. Likewise (\u03b4\u03bd)# : T \u2217 T \u2217 S \u2192 T T \u2217 S is an antisymple tomorphism and so \u03b8S/H\nis anti\u0015Poisson. It follows that the ore maps are also anti\u0015Poisson, and so \u0398H is a Poisson\nmap. The ase of \u0398V follows in the same way. This on ludes the proof of Proposition 6.3\nand with it the proof of Theorem 6.2.\n2\nIt is also possible to prove that for any L A \u0015groupoid (\u03a9; G, A; M ) applying the Lie\nfun tor yields a double Lie algebroid (A\u03a9; AG, A; M ). In this ase there is no version of the\nanoni al involution J and it is ne essary to work with prolonged Lie algebroid stru tures;\nsee [20, 3.3\u2104.\nSeveral examples of the double Lie algebroid of spe i\u001c double Lie groupoids are given in\n[20, \u009f4\u2104. We on lude by noting three other examples.\n\nExample 6.4\n\nTake S to be the double groupoid (M 4 ; M \u00d7M, M \u00d7M ; M ) in whi h a quadruple of points is regarded as de\u001cning a square by its four verti es. Then A2 S is the double tane H redu es to \u0398M . The asso iated Lie bialgebroid is (T \u2217 T \u2217 M, T T \u2217 M )\ngent bundle T 2 M and \u0398\n\u2217\non base T M with its standard symple ti stru ture.\n\nExample 6.5\n\nAn a\u001enoid W [37\u2104 on a manifold M may be regarded as a va ant double Lie\nsubgroupoid of M 4 in the previous example, su h that both side groupoids H and V are the\ngraphs of simple foliations de\u001cned by surje tive submersions \u03c01 : M \u2192 Q1 and \u03c02 : M \u2192 Q2\n31\n\n\fK. C. H. Ma kenzie\n\n[16, \u009f3\u2104. The orresponding double Lie algebroid was al ulated dire tly in [19\u2104 to be a double\nLie subalgebroid (A2 W ; T \u03c01 M, T \u03c02 M ; M ) of T 2 M with bra kets de\u001cned by a pair of onjugate\n\u001dat partial onne tions on M adapted to the two foliations. The Lie bialgebroid in this ase\nis (T \u03c01 M \u22c9 (T \u03c02 M )\u2217 , (T \u03c01 M )\u2217 \u22ca T \u03c02 M ) where the semi\u0015dire t stru tures are also de\u001cned by\nthe onne tions.\n\nExample 6.6\n\nLet (S; H, V ; M ) be a double Lie groupoid and write D = A2 S . Consider the\notangent double groupoid (T \u2217 S; A\u2217V S, A\u2217H S; A\u2217 K).
