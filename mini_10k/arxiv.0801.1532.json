The first results of this kind were obtained in [ABK]. This type\nof problem arises naturally in frame theory and in sampling theory [ABK]. More\ngenerally matrices with certain decay far from the diagonal have been extensively\nstudied over the last 20 years (see for instance [Bas, J, FGL1, FGL2, S1]). It has\napplications in various fields of analysis, such as pseudo-differential operators [Sj,\nG4], numerical analysis [CS, S2, S3], wavelet analysis [J], time-frequency analysis\n[G1, G2, G3], sampling [ABK, CG, G3]), and Gabor frames [BCHL, CG, Sj].\n\n1.1\n\nLeft-invertibility of thin-sparse operators\n\nRecall that a discrete metric space X is called doubling with doubling constant\nD if for all r > 0 and x \u2208 X\nV (x, 2r) \u2264 DV (x, r),\nwhere V (x, r) denotes the cardinality of the closed ball of radius r. Examples\nof doubling metric spaces are Zn , and more generally groups with polynomial\ngrowth. Recall that a countable group G has polynomial growth if for every\nfinite subset U \u2282 G, there exists C = C(U) and d = d(U) such that |U n | \u2264 Cnd .\nBy a deep theorem of Gromov [Gro1], a finitely generated group G has polynomial\ngrowth if and only if has a nilpotent normal subgroup of finite index. It then\nfollows from [Gui] that there exists an integer d = d(G) such that for all finite\nsymmetric generating subset U of G, there exists C = C(U) such that\nC \u22121 nd \u2264 |U n | \u2264 Cnd .\nAs a result, the group G, equipped with the word metric dU (g, h) = inf{n \u2208\nN, g \u22121h \u2208 U n } is a doubling metric space.\nGiven a doubling metric space X and a countable set Y , we consider an\noperator A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X , bounded on l2 , whose rows are supported in balls\nof bounded radius (i.e. are thin), and whose columns have only a bounded number\nof non-zero entries (i.e. are sparse): we call such a matrix thin-sparse.\nOur first main result states that if A is bounded below in lp for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264\n\u221e, then, B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 defines a left-inverse for A, which is uniformly bounded\non lq for q \u2208 [1, \u221e].\nTheorem 1.1. Let X be a doubling metric space and let A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X be\nthin-sparse matrix with bounded coefficients. Then,\n\u2022 either\n\n\u03bbp (A) = 0\n\nfor all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n2\n\n\f\u2022 or there exists C < \u221e, such that B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 satisfies\nkBkp\u2192p \u2264 C,\nfor all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, and hence defines a left-inverse for A.\nRemark 1.2. Note that for a matrix A whose rows have bounded support, a\nuniform bound on the coefficients is equivalent to the fact that A is bounded in\nl\u221e . So, if A is bounded in lp for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, as in particular its coefficients\nare bounded, it is also bounded in l\u221e . Hence by interpolation, it is bounded for\nall p \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e.\nWe shall discuss the optimality of this result latter in subsection 1.4. One\ncan actually drop the assumption of sparseness on the columns of A, and obtain\nthe following stronger statement (indeed Theorem 1.1 follows by taking p < 1 in\nthe following theorem). Say that a matrix (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X is thin-\u00d8 if rows are\nthin, i.e. supported on balls of bounded radius (and no assumption is made on\ncolumns).\nTheorem 1.3. Let A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X be a thin-\u00d8 matrix. Assume moreover\nthat A is bounded as an operator lp (X) \u2192 lp (Y ) for some 0 < p < \u221e (equivalently bounded on lq for all p \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e). Then,\n\u2022 either\n\nkAf kq\n=0\nf 6=0 kf kq\n\n\u03bbq (A) := inf\n\nwhenever p < q \u2264 \u221e and q \u2265 1;\n\u2022 or there exists c > 0, such that\n\n\u03bbq (A) \u2265 c,\nif max(p, 1) \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e. In the latter case, if p \u2264 2, then B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217\ndefines a left-inverse for A, which is uniformly bounded on lq for\nmax(p, 1) \u2264 q \u2264 p/(max(p, 1) \u2212 1).\nThe conclusion of Theorem 1.3 is optimal as one can easily construct for every\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e a matrix A = (ay,x )y,x\u2208N with one non-zero coefficient in each row\nand such that\n\u2022 A is bounded in lq , for q \u2265 p,\n\u2022 \u03bbp (A) > 0,\n3\n\n\f\u2022 \u03bbq (A) = 0 for all p < q \u2264 \u221e.\nTo see this, consider a matrix such that the n'th column contains exactly n nonzero coefficients equal to n\u22121/p , such that the columns are piecewise orthogonal\n(i.e. have disjoint supports).\nRemark 1.4. Theorem 1.1 has been proved recently [ABK] for slanted matrices:\nlet \u03b1 \u2208 R\u2217 , a matrix (ay,z )y,z\u2208Zd is called \u03b1-slanted if its support in Zd \u00d7Zd lies at\nbounded distance from the subspace of Rd \u00d7Rd defined by {(x, y) \u2208 Rd \u00d7Rd , y =\n\u03b1z}.\nAlthough our proof is clearly different from the one of [ABK], both approaches\nshare an important idea which consists in restricting A to functions supported in\nballs of radius L. This reduces the problem to dimension . Ld , which enables us\nto use quantitative comparisons between lp -norms, before letting L go to infinity.\nPrecisely, we prove the following fact which might be of independent interest (see\nTheorem 4.1 for a more general statement).\nTheorem 1.5. Let X be a doubling metric space, and let A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X be\na thin-\u00d8 matrix. Assume that the matrix |A| = (|ay,x |)y\u2208Y,x\u2208X defines a bounded\noperator lp (X) \u2192 lp (Y ), for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Then, there exist C1 and C2 such\nthat for all L \u2265 1, there is a non-zero function h supported in a ball of radius L\nsuch that for all p \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e,\nC2\nkAhkq\n\u2264 C1 \u03bbq (A) +\n.\nkhkq\nL\n(C1 only depends on the space X, and for X = Z, we can take C1 = 6. But C2\nalso depends on k|A|kp\u2192p).\nThe estimate in O(1/L) for the error term is optimal as one can easily check\nwith A = 1 \u2212 P , where P is1 the convolution by the normalized characteristic\nfunction of {\u22121, 1}, acting on lp (Z).\n\n1.2\n\nApplication to Schur operators\n\nWe are able (see Theorem 6.2) to extend Theorem 1.1 in a way to include all\nmatrices which can be approximated in a suitable sense by thin-sparse matrices.\nHere, we only focus on a special case, i.e. where X = Y and where the matrices\ncan be approximated by banded ones.\nWe will say that a matrix (ax,y ) indexed by a metric space X is N-banded (or\nhas propagation \u2264 N) if ax,y = 0 as soon as d(x, y) > N.\n1\n\nNote that P is the diffusion operator associated with the simple random walk on Z.\n\n4\n\n\fWe will denote by A the algebra of Schur operators. Recall a Schur operator\non l2 is an operator which is bounded both on l1 and on l\u221e , its Schur norm being\nP\nP\ndefined as kAkA = kAk1\u21921 + kAk\u221e\u2192\u221e = supi j |ai,j | + supj i |ai,j |.\nTheorem 1.6. Let X be a doubling metric space, and let A = (ax,y ) be a Schur\nmatrix indexed by X such that there exists a sequence of r-banded matrices Ar\nsuch that\nr\u2192\u221e\nr t * kA \u2212 Ar kA \u2212\u2192 0,\nfor some t > 0. Then the following are equivalent\n\u2022 A is bounded below for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n\u2022 A is bounded below for all such p,\n\u2022 B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 defines a left-inverse of A lying in A.\nThe first notion of weighted Schur algebra has been introduced in [GL], and\nthen generalized in [Su]. Following [Su, Section 2.2], if X is a metric space and\n\u03c9 : X \u00d7 X \u2192 [1, \u221e) is an admissible weight in the sense of [GL] or of [Su], then\nwe can define the weighted Schur algebra A\u03c9 (X) as the space of operators which\nare bounded for the norm\nX\nX\n\u03c9(x, y)|ax,y |.\n\u03c9(x, y)|ax,y | + sup\nkAkA,\u03c9 = sup\nx\n\ny\n\ny\n\nx\n\nTypical admissible weights are\n\u03c9(x, y) = 1 + d(x, y)\u03b1,\nfor \u03b1 \u2265 0, and\n\n\u03c9(x, y) = exp(Cd(x, y)\u03b4 ),\n\nfor some C > 0, and 0 < \u03b4 < 1. Since the notion of admissible weight is very\ntechnical, and will never be used here, we will not recall it (or else, we suggest the\nreader to consider the two previous typical examples as a definition of admissible\nweights since they both satisfy the conditions of [GL] and of [Su]).\nCorollary 1.7. Let X be a doubling metric space, and let \u03c9 be an admissible\nweight such that \u03c9(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y)\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0. Then the following are\nequivalent\n\u2022 A is bounded below for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n\u2022 A is bounded below for all such p,\n5\n\n\f\u2022 B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 defines a left-inverse of A lying in A\u03c9 (X).\nProof: First an easy observation shows that the matrices AN obtained na\u0131\u0308vely\nby replacing all coefficients ax,y , where d(x, y) > N by zeros satisfy the hypothesis\nof Theorem 1.6. The last statement follows from Theorem 1.6, together with the\nfacts that A\u03c9 (X) is an involutive algebra, and is spectral (or inverse-closed),\nwhich are both proved in [GL, Su] (for different types of weights). Namely, since\nA\u03c9 (X) is involutive, A\u2217 \u2208 A\u03c9 (X), as it is an algebra, A\u2217 A \u2208 A\u03c9 (X), since it\nis spectral, (A\u2217 A)\u22121 \u2208 A\u03c9 (X), and finally, we conclude using that A\u03c9 (X) is an\nalgebra. \u0004\n\n1.3\n\nApplication to the class of convolution-dominated operators\n\nLet G be a discrete group. Recall the Gohberg-Baskakov-Sj\u00f6strand class [Su]\n(also called the convolution dominated operators class [FGL2]) C(G) is the set of\nall operators on l2 (G) which are bounded for the following norm\nX\nkAkC(G) =\nsup |ag,h |.\nk\u2208G g\n\n\u22121 h=k\n\nLet \u03c9 be an admissible weight. We shall also suppose that \u03c9 is left-invariant, i.e.\nsatisfies2 \u03c9(gk, gh) = \u03c9(k, h) for all g, h, k \u2208 G. Following [FGL2], one can define\nthe weighted convolution dominated algebra, comprising all matrices A which are\nbounded for the following norm\nX\nkAkC\u03c9 (G) =\nsup \u03c9(g, h)|ag,h|.\nk\u2208G g\n\n\u22121 h=k\n\nTheorem 1.8. Let G be a group with polynomial growth, and let \u03c9 be an admissible left-invariant weight such that \u03c9(g, h) \u2265 d(g, h)\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent\n\u2022 A is bounded below for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n\u2022 A is bounded below for all such p,\n\u2022 B = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 defines a left-inverse of A lying in C\u03c9 (G).\n2\nObserve that the two typical classes of weights defined at the previous subsection are indeed\nleft-invariant, when defined with a left-invariant metric.\n\n6\n\n\fThe proof is completely similar to that of Theorem 1.7 using the fact, proved\nin [FGL2] (see also [Su] for a weaker statement) that C\u03c9 (G) is a spectral involutive\nalgebra for all admissible weight.\nIt turns out that our condition on the weight is not optimal. Indeed, in a\nvery recent paper, Shin and Sun managed to prove the above theorem for any\nadmissible weight when G = Zn [ShS]. We believe that their proof should also\nwork for a group with polynomial growth, although this remains to be checked\ncarefully.\nFinally, let us mention that even in the context of convolution operators on\na group of polynomial growth, the above theorem is new, and has the following\napplication. In view of [Ch, Theorem 4.3], we obtain\nCorollary 1.9. Let G be a group with polynomial group, and suppose that an\nelement A \u2208 CG is bounded below in lp for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, then A is invertible\nin B(lq (G)) for all 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e. \u0004\n\n1.4\n\nOptimality of the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 and\nCorollary 1.7\n\nThere are two natural questions arising from Corollary 1.7. Namely, can we relax,\nor simply drop one of the two main assumptions: the doubling condition on the\nspace X, and the strict polynomial decay of the coefficients?\nFirst, Corollary 1.7 cannot be extended to the unweighted Schur algebra A\nsince we exhibited in [T] a matrix in A which is bounded below in l2 but not\nin l\u221e . As Nigel Kalton pointed to me, this fact is actually well-known amongst\ninterpolation theoretists. An easy example is A = I \u2212 D, where D is the dilation\noperator on l2 (N), i.e.\nD(a0 , a1 , . . .) = (a0 /2, a0 /2, a1 /2, a1 /2, . . .).\nNote that the operator A\u2217 = 1 \u2212 D \u2217 is invertible in l2 but not left-invertible in\nl1 . Indeed, the sequence of normalized characteristic functions \u03c6n = 1[0,n\u22121] /n\nsatisfies kA\u2217 \u03c6n k1 \u2192 0. One can extend this idea to get examples which are not\n\u221a\nleft-invertible in lp for 1 < p < 2, by replacing D by \u03bbD, where 1 < \u03bb < 2.\nNote that these examples do not exhibit any decay at infinity. On the other\nhand, the example given in [T] is a banded matrix3 indexed by the vertex set\nof the 3-regular tree T . Therefore it belongs to A\u03c9 (T ) for any weight \u03c9 on T .\nHence, it gives a partial answer to the question of whether the metric space is\n3\n\nIndeed, the operator considered in [T] is a symmetric element of the group algebra of the\nfree group with two generators F2 seen as a convolution operator on lp (F2 ).\n\n7\n\n\frequired to be doubling or not. Actually, it is easy to see that T has exponential\ngrowth, and therefore does not satisfy the doubling condition. Moreover, as we\nwill see below, T is a key example among those spaces4 . Note that a matrix\nindexed by T can be easily \"extended\" to a matrix indexed by X still satisfying\nthe properties we are interested in. This provides a wide class of examples of\nmetric spaces for which Corollary 1.7 (and actually even Theorem 1.1 for banded\nmatrices) fails to be true. For instance, this excludes any metric space which is the\nvertex set of some non-amenable k-regular graphs. Those are graphs satisfying\nan isoperimetric inequality\n|\u2202A| \u2265 c|A|,\nfor every finite subset A of vertices of the graph, where c is some positive constant.\nThe boundary \u2202A denotes the set of edges joining vertices of A to its complement.\nIndeed, by the main result of [BS], such a graph admits a bi-Lipschitz embedded\n3-regular tree. Most known finitely generated groups have exponential growth,\nand among them, a large class have been shown to admit a Lipschitz embedded\ncopy of T : this comprises by the previously mentioned result the huge class\nof non-amenable groups, while for instance Rosenblatt [R] proved it for nonvirtually nilpotent solvable groups, which form a large class of amenable groups\nwith exponential growth.\nHowever, there is still an interesting question which remains open: sticking\nto matrices indexed by Z for instance, does the conclusion of Corollary 1.7 hold\nfor \u2013say\u2013 logarithmic decay?\n\n1.5\n\nAbout the proofs\n\nThe proofs of Theorem 1.1 and of its variants split into two main parts. First,\nwe need to show that if A is bounded below for some p, then it is uniformly\nbounded below in lq for all q's. The second part of the proof consists in showing\nthat the left-inverse exists and is uniformly bounded in lp for all p's. Let us now\nexplain how the second part follows from the first one. We will deduce it from\nthe following elementary observation.\nProposition 1.10. Let X and Y be two sets, and let A be an operator l2 (X) \u2192\nl2 (Y ) such that A and A\u2217 are uniformly bounded in lp for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. We\nhave\n\u2022 \u03bb2 (A\u2217 A) = \u03bb2 (A)2 ,\n4\n\nIndeed, it is an open question whether a discrete metric space X with exponential growth\nadmits a Lipschitz embedded copy of T .\n\n8\n\n\f\u2022 if A is self-adjoint and \u03bbp (A) > 0, for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, then A is invertible\nin lp , and kA\u22121 kp = 1/\u03bbp (A).\nProof: The first statement simply follows from\n\u03bb2 (A\u2217 A) = inf hA\u2217 Af, f i = inf kAf k22 = \u03bb2 (A)2 .\nkf k2 =1\n\nkf k2 =1\n\nTo show the second statement, observe that since A is self-adjoint, \u03bb2 (A) > 0\nimplies that A is invertible in l2 . Hence, A\u22121 is defined on lp (Y ) \u2229 l2 (Y ) which\nis dense in lp (Y ) for all p. But then\nkAf kp\nf \u2208lp (Y )\u2229l2 (Y ) kf kp\nkf kp\n=\ninf 2\np\nf \u2208l (Y )\u2229l (Y ) kA\u22121 f kp\n= 1/kA\u22121 kp\u2192p .\n\n\u03bbp (A) =\n\ninf\n\nSo the proposition is proved. \u0004\nTo fix the ideas, let us focus on the second statement of Theorem 1.1, assuming\nthe first statement. If \u03bbp (A) \u2265 c > 0 for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, then in particular, this\nis true for p = 2. So \u03bb2 (A\u2217 A) \u2265 c2 , which implies that A\u2217 A is invertible. But\n\u03bb2 (A\u2217 A) > c2 , and by Proposition 3.2, A\u2217 A is banded. So by the first statement\nof Theorem 1.1 applied to A\u2217 A, there exists c\u2032 > 0 such that \u03bbp (A\u2217 A) \u2265 c\u2032 for\nall 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Finally as k(A\u2217 A)\u22121 kp = 1/\u03bbp (A\u2217 A) \u2264 1/c\u2032 , we conclude that\nB = (A\u2217 A)\u22121 A\u2217 satisfies\nkBkp \u2264 kA\u2217 kp /c\u2032 ,\nwhich is bounded independently of p.\nRemark 1.11. Note that the fact that the left-inverse A\u2217 (A\u2217 A)\u22121 is uniformly\nbounded in lp for all p is also an immediate consequence of the fact that (A\u2217 A)\u22121\nlies in the Schur algebra [GL, Su].\nLet us now summarize the first part of the proof of Theorems 1.1, 1.3. Let us\nassume that \u03bbp0 > 0 for some 1 \u2264 p0 \u2264 \u221e. In views of Proposition 1.10, we only\nneed to show that \u03bbp > 0 for all p.\n1. The first step, Theorem 1.5, is the central part of this paper (see Section 4).\nWe show that the doubling property can be used to approximate the lp norm of a function f by taking the norm of its projection over a subset\nconsisting of a union of distant balls of fixed radius. However, the naive\nidea consisting in applying A directly to this projection would only yield\n9\n\n\fan error term in L1/p , which would not enable us to deduce anything from\nthe statement that \u03bb\u221e (A) > 0 (but would work for any p < \u221e). Instead,\nwe multiply f by a certain Lipchitz function which is also supported on a\nunion of distant balls.\n2. To obtain the uniform lower bound for \u03bbq (A), using Theorem 1.5 is quite\ntechnical but the general idea is easy to understand: Theorem 1.5 says\nq\n, where h are\nthat we can approximate \u03bbq (A) by quotients of the form kAhk\nkhkq\nsupported in balls of radius L (hence, restricting to subspaces of dimension\n\u2248 v(L) which is roughly less than Ld for some d), and the error that we\nmake is roughly in 1/L. Comparing these quotients for different values of q\n(and the same function h), we multiply our error term by Ld|1/p\u22121/q| . The\nresulting error term will therefore go to zero if p and q are close enough,\nnamely if d|1/p \u2212 1/q| < 1. Then, we just need to \"propagate\" the comparison that we get between \u03bbp (A) and \u03bbq (A) to obtain a uniform lower\nbound. Note that similar ideas are used in [ABK, ShS].\n3. Then, we extend Theorem 1.1 to operators that are somehow \"polynomially\napproximated\" by thin-sparse operators: we call them almost thin-sparse\noperators (see Section 6). The idea of the proof is very similar to step 2\n(see Lemma 6.4).\n4. The proof of Theorem 1.3 essentially consists in showing that a thin-\u00d8\noperator which is bounded in lp , is almost thin-sparse in lq for all q > p,\nwhich is easily checked.\nAcknowledgments.

However,\nin the definition of thin-sparse operators, only X needs a structure of metric\nspace (Y can be any set).\n\n10\n\n\fLet Cc (X) be the space of finitely supported real-valued functions on X. Let\nA be a linear map from Cc (X) to RY . The kernel (also called the matrix) of A,\n(ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X is defined by the relation\nX\nAf (y) =\nay,x f (x),\nx\u2208X\n\nfor every f \u2208 Cc (X). Conversely a matrix, i.e. a family of reals (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X\ndefines a linear morphism by the same formula.\nThe row of index y \u2208 Y of A is the vector (ay,x )x\u2208X of RX . The column of\nindex x \u2208 X of A is the vector (ay,x )y\u2208Y of RY . The support of A is the subset\nof Y \u00d7 X on which ay,x 6= 0. We define similarly the support of a row or of a\ncolumn of A.\n\nNotation 2.1. If the rows of a matrix A = (ay,x )y\u2208Y satisfy some property \"P\",\nand if its columns satisfy some property \"Q\", we will say that \"A is P-Q\". If we\nmake no assumption on the columns, we will say that A is P-\u00d8, and so on. We\nwill consider two properties for the rows or the columns:\n\u2022 We say that the rows (or the column) of A are thin, of thickness at most r\nif their support are contained in balls of radius r.\n\u2022 We say that the rows (or the columns) are sparse, of sparseness at most v\nif their support has cardinality at most v.\n\u2022 We denote by T S(X, Y ) (resp. ST (X, Y ), T (X, Y ), \u00d8T (X, Y ) and T \u00d8(X, Y ))\nthe space of thin-sparse (resp. sparse-thin, thin-thin, \u00d8-thin and thin-\u00d8)\noperators.\nAs the spaces have bounded geometry, sparse is a weaker condition than thin.\nHence sparse-sparse is weaker than thin-sparse, which is weaker than thin-thin,\netc.\nRemark 2.2. A particular case of thin-thin matrices (when X = Y ) are matrices\nfor which the support is contained in {(y, x) \u2208 X 2 , d(x, y) \u2264 r} for some r > 0.\nSuch matrices are sometimes called banded, or with finite propagation.\nNotation 2.3.\n\u2022 For all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the norm of an operator A : lp (X) \u2192 lp (Y ) is called\nthe lp -norm of A and is denoted by kAkp\u2192p .\n\u2022 Let A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X . The absolute value of A is operator |A| = (|ay,x |)(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X .\n\u2022 We say that A is absolutely uniformly bounded if\nsup k|A|kp\u2192p < \u221e.\n\n1\u2264p\u2264\u221e\n\n11\n\n\f3\n\nPreliminary remarks about thin-sparse operators\n\n3.1\n\nCombinatorial properties\n\nThe following easy fact is a crucial property of TS operators. We say that two\nsubsets U and V of a metric space are t-disjoint if d(x, y) > t for all (x, y) \u2208 U \u00d7V .\nProposition 3.1. Let X be a metric space, and Y be a set. Let A be a thin-\u00d8\noperator of thickness r and let v and u be two functions on X whose supports are\n2r-disjoint. Then, Au and Av (which are well defined functions) have disjoint\nsupport.\nProof: We just have to consider a row L of A and to prove that hL, ui =\n6 0\nimplies hL, vi = 0. But this is a trivial consequence of the fact that L is supported\nin a ball of radius r, which has diameter \u2264 2r, and that the supports of u and v\nare at distance > 2r. \u0004\nThe following proposition is straightforward and left as an exercise.\nProposition 3.2. Let X be a metric space and let Y be a set. If A \u2208 T \u00d8(X, Y )\nthen A\u2217 A (when it exists) is banded. \u0004\n\n3.2\n\nNorms of sparse-sparse operators are equivalent\n\nProposition 3.3. A sparse-sparse operator A is absolutely uniformly bounded, if\nand only if it is bounded in lp for some 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, if and only if it has bounded\ncoefficients.\nProof: Let X and Y be two sets and let A = (ay,x )(x,y)\u2208X\u00d7Y be a sparse-sparse\noperator of sparseness v. Note that the norm kAk\u221e = sup(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X |a(y, x)| is\ntrivially less than all operator norms. Hence it is enough to prove that for every\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, kAkp\u2192p \u2264 CkAk\u221e for some C depending only on v. Fix y \u2208 Y , and\nlet Sy be the support of the corresponding row (ay,x )x\u2208X . For every f \u2208 Cc (X),\n|Af (y)| =\n\nX\n\nx\u2208X\n\nay,x f (x) \u2264 kAk\u221e\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Sy\n\n|f (x)|.\n\nHence, using H\u00f6lder's inequality and the majoration |Sy | \u2264 v for all y \u2208 Y , we\n\n12\n\n\fobtain\nkAf kpp \u2264 kAkp\u221e\n\u2264 kAkp\u221e\n\nX\ny\u2208Y\n\nX\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Sy\n\nv p\u22121\n\ny\u2208Y\n\n\uf8f6p\n\n|f (x)|\uf8f8\n\nX\n\nx\u2208Sy\n\n|f (x)|p\n\nNow, note that for every x \u2208 X and every k \u2208 N, f (x) appears k times in the sum\nabove if there are k distinct elements of Y , y1 , . . . , yk such that x \u2208 Sy1 \u2229. . . \u2229Syk ,\nhence if y1 , . . . , yk lie in the support of the column (ay,x )y\u2208Y . But as the sparseness\nof A is at most v, this implies that k \u2264 v.

Assume that X is a doubling metric space and let A \u2208 T \u00d8(X, Y )\nof thickness r, such that k|A|kp\u2192p \u2264 1 for some 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. There exists C such\nthat for every f \u2208 Lp (X), and every L \u2265 r, there exists a function h \u2208 Lp (X)\nsupported in a ball of radius 2L such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\nkAf kp\nkAhkp\n,\n\u2264C\n+\nkhkp\nkf kp\nL\nwhere, the quantity C only depends on the doubling constant of X.\n\n4.1\n\nColoring of a family of balls\n\nRecall that a d-coloring of a set P of subsets of X is a map\nj : P \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , d + 1}\nsuch that every two elements in P with the same color (i.e. same image by j) are\ndisjoint.\n13\n\n\fAlso classical is the notion of coloring of a graph: a d-coloring of a graph G\nis a map\nj : V (G) \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , d + 1},\nwhere V (G) is the vertex set of G, such that any two adjacent vertices have\ndistinct colors. A classical result of graph theory, known as Brooks' theorem says\nthat any graph of degree at most d admits a d-coloring.\nIt tuns out that these two definitions of coloring are related via the notion\nof dual graph. Recall that the dual graph G of P is defined as follows: the set\nof vertices V (G) is P, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they have a\nnon-empty intersection. Clearly, a d-coloring of G yields a d-coloring of P and\nconversely.\nWe will need the following lemma.\nLemma 4.2. Let X be a doubling metric space and let \u03b1 \u2265 1. There exists an\ninteger d such that for every L > 0, there exists a covering of X by balls of radius\nL admitting a d-coloring such that the centers of two balls of same color are at\ndistance \u2265 \u03b1L from one another.\nProof: Consider a minimal covering B = (B(xi , L))i of X (which exists since\nX is doubling). By minimality, the balls B(xi , L/4) are piecewise disjoint.\nNow, consider the covering B\u2032 = (B(xi , \u03b1L))i . It is easy to see that the\ndoubling property implies that the dual graph of B\u2032 has degree less than a certain\nconstant d. Indeed, for every i, let di be degree at the vertex i of the dual graph. In\nother words, di is the number of balls B(xj , \u03b1L) with j 6= i, intersecting B(xi , \u03b1L).\nLet Ji be the set of such indices. Note that the disjoint union \u222aj\u2208Ji B(xj , L/4)\nis contained in B(xi , 4\u03b1L). On the other hand, by the doubling property, there\nexits c > 0 only depending on \u03b1 such that inf j\u2208Ji V (xj , L/4)/V (xi , 4\u03b1L) \u2265 c. But\nsince\ndi inf V (xj , L/4) \u2264 V (xi , 4\u03b1L),\nj\u2208Ji\n\nwe deduce that di \u2264 1/c, so that we can set d = [1/c].\nHence, by Brooks' theorem, this graph admits a d-coloring, which means that\n\u2032\nB has a d-coloring. Inducing this coloring to B yields the desired d-coloring. \u0004\n\n4.2\n\nApproximating a function by a function supported by\na disjoint union of balls of fixed radius.\n\nIn the following lemma we characterize the doubling condition in terms of approximation of functions by functions supported by disjoint unions of balls of\nfixed radius.\n14\n\n\fFor every subset \u03a9 of a metric space X and every L > 0, we denote\n[\u03a9]L = {x \u2208 X, d(x, \u03a9) \u2264 L}.\nWe also denote the characteristic function of a subset \u03a9 by 1\u03a9 . Finally, a Kseparated subset of X is a subset whose elements are pairwise at distance at least\nK.\nLemma 4.3. A metric space X is doubling if and only if for every \u03b1 \u2265 1, there\nexists a constant c > 0 such that for every 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, every f \u2208 lp (X) and\nevery L > 0, one can find an \u03b1L-separated subset P of X such that\nk1[P ]L f kp \u2265 ckf kp .\nProof: Consider the covering B of the previous lemma and for every 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 d + 1, let Pk be the set of centers of balls of B with same color k. Since\nS\nX = d+1\nk=1 [Pk ]L , we have\nX\nX\nkf kp \u2264 k\n1[Pk ]L |f |kp \u2264\nk1[Pk ]L f kp \u2264 (d + 1) max k1[Pk ]L f kp .\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nSo Lemma 4.3 follows taking P = Pk with a k for which the max is attained. The\nconverse follows by taking f to be the characteristic function of a ball of radius\n2L and \u03b1 \u2265 6, so that the intersection between [P ]L and our ball of radius 2L is\ncontained in a single ball of radius L. \u0004\nIn the sequel, we fix \u03b1 = 6.\nThe following lemma is trivial and left to the reader.\nLemma 4.4. For each P like in the previous lemma, the function \u2206P , defined\nby\n\u2206P (x) = max{0, 1 \u2212 d(x, P )/(2L)},\nsatisfies\n1. \u2206P = 0 outside of [P ]2L\n2. \u2206P \u2265 1/2 on [P ]L .\n3. \u2206P is 1/(2L)-Lipschitz.\n4. 0 \u2264 \u2206P \u2264 1.\n\u0004\n\n15\n\n\fRemark 4.5. Keeping the notation of the previous lemmas, the function g = \u2206P f\nsatisfies, thanks to the second property of \u2206P and to Lemma 4.3,\nkgkp \u2265 ckf kp .\nOn the other hand, the support of g is contained in a union of 4L-disjoint balls\nP\nof radius 2L. Write g = i gi , where each gi is supported in one of those balls.\nAssume that 4L \u2265 2r. Then by Proposition 3.1,\nX\nkAgkpp =\nkAgi kpp .\ni\n\nSo we have\ninf\ni\n\nkAgkp\nkAgi kp\n\u2264\n.\nkgi kp\nkgkp\n\nProof of Theorem 4.1.\nThanks to the previous remark, we just need to\nprove a weaker version of the theorem where in the conclusion, the function h is\nreplaced by a function g supported in a union of 2r-disjoint balls of radius 2L.\nWe consider g = \u2206P f , which has this property since L \u2265 r. Let us start with a\npointwise estimate. Fix some y0 \u2208 Y . For every x, z \u2208 X,\ng(x) = \u2206P (x)f (x) = \u2206P (z)f (x) + (\u2206P (x) \u2212 \u2206P (z))f (x).\nWe now specify z = x0 , such that the support of the row (ay0 ,x )x is contained in\nB(x0 , r). We have\nX\nX\nay0 ,x (\u2206P (x) \u2212 \u2206P (x0 ))f (x).\nAg(y0 ) = \u2206P (x0 )\nay0 ,x f (x) +\nx\n\nx\n\nSo by Property (4) of \u2206P ,\n|Ag(y0)| \u2264 |Af (y0 )| +\n\nX\nx\n\n|ay0 ,x ||\u2206P (x) \u2212 \u2206P (x0 )||f (x)|.\n\nBy Property (3) of \u2206P ,\n|Ag(y0)| \u2264 |Af (y0)| +\n\nr|A||f |(y0)\n.\nL\n\nNow, taking the lp norm and applying the triangular inequality, we obtain\nkAgkp \u2264 kAf kp +\n\nrk|A||f |kp\n.\nL\n\nWe finally divide by kgkp, and conclude thanks to the inequality kgkp \u2265 ckf kp . \u0004\n16\n\n\fRemark 4.6. For X = Z, we have v(k) = 2k + 1, and the doubling constant is less\nthan 2. Note that we can take P = {x0 + 6kL, k \u2208 Z} for some x0 . Moreover,\none checks easily that a good choice of x0 gives\nk1P f kp \u2265 kf kp /3.\nNow assume that A is thin-thin of thickness \u2264 r. By the proof of Proposition 3.3,\nwe have k|A|k \u2264 v(r)kAk\u221e. Hence, we obtain that there exists a function h\nsupported on a ball of radius r such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nkAf kp 3r 2 kAk\u221e\nkAhkp\n.\n\u22643\n+\nkhkp\nkf kp\nL\n\n5\n\nlp-stability of thin-sparse operators\n\nHere is a more general version of Theorems 1.1, with some precisions that we\nomitted in the introduction.\nTheorem 5.1. Let X be a metric space of doubling constant D < \u221e and let\nY be any set. Fix some r, v > 0. Let A \u2208 T S(X, Y ) be of thickness at most r,\nsparseness at most v. Assume moreover that k|A|kp\u2192p \u2264 1 for all 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.\nThen there exist c = c(r, v, D) > 0 and \u03b4 = \u03b4(D) > 0 for all 1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 \u221e,\n\u03bbp (A) \u2265 c\u03bbq (A)\u03b4 .\nIn Section 6, we prove that the conclusion Theorem 5.1 is true for more general\noperators which are \"well\" approximated by thin-sparse and thin-\u00d8 operators\nrespectively.\nTheorem 5.1 (and the remark following Theorem 7.1) result from the following\nmore precise results. Let\n\u03bb = inf \u03bbp (A),\np0 \u2264p\u2264\u221e\n\nand let pm be such that \u03bbpm \u2265 \u03bb/2.

Let A \u2208 T S(X, Y ) of thickness r, sparseness v and such that\nk|A|kp\u2192p \u2264 1 for all p0 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.

Indeed, if p \u2264 q, then we obtain (i) applying the left inequality\nof (5.1) to Ah (where the support of Ah does not play any role) and the right\ninequality to h, whose support has cardinality at most KLd . So take C \u2032 = CK.\nIf p \u2265 q, then we apply the right inequality of (5.1) to Ah for which we control\nthe support thanks to the sparseness of A's columns. Namely, the cardinality of\nthe support of Ah is at most v times the cardinality of h's support. This explains\nthe corresponding power of v in (ii). \u0004\nLemma 5.5.

To prove (i), we just have to\nnote that the vanishing of \u03bbp (A) \"propagates\" thanks to Lemma 5.4: \u03bbp (A) =\n0 \u21d2 \u03bbq (A) = 0 if | dq \u2212 dp | \u2264 1/2 (let L \u2192 \u221e). \u0004\nProof: To show Theorems 5.2 and 5.3. we \"propagate\" the inequalities (ii) of\nLemmas 5.5 and 5.6. As the proofs are the same for both theorems, let us focus\non the first one. If dp \u2212 dq \u2264 1/2, the inequality (ii) of Lemma 5.6 yields\n\u03bbp (A) \u2264 C(v, r, d)\u03bbq (A)2 .\nNow, as pdm \u2212\ntheorem. \u0004\n\nd\npM\n\n\u2264 d, we just need to iterate this 2d times, which gives the\n\nRemark 5.7. Here, assume that X = Y = Z, and that A is thin-thin of thickness\nr. Instead of assuming that k|A|k = 1, we prefer to write Lemma 5.6 with respect\nto kAk\u221e (which is easier to compute in general): a consequence is that we have to\nreplace r by 3r 3kAk\u221e . From Remark 4.6 that we can take C \u2032 = 9 in Lemma 5.4\n(as v(r) \u2264 3r). Hence we can take K = 18.

Before proving the theorem, we point out that one cannot improve\nthe theorem to have p0 = p1 . Indeed, in the spirit of the example explained in the\nintroduction, for r = 1 and X = Y = Z, we can find a sequence of thin-sparse\noperators An = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X of thickness 1, sparseness n, and such that\n\u2022 kAn kp0 \u2192p0 = \u03bbp0 (An ) = 1 for all n \u2208 N,\n\u2022 and \u03bbp (An ) \u2192 0 when n \u2192 0 for all p > p0 .\nOn the other hand, it is interesting to note that (in virtue of Theorem 5.3) there\nexists c\u2032 = c(r, D) > 0 and \u03b4 \u2032 = \u03b4 \u2032 (D) > 0 such that for all p0 \u2264 p \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e\n\u2032\n\n\u03bbp (A) \u2265 c\u2032 \u03bbq (A)\u03b4 .\nTheorem 7.1 results from Theorem 6.3 and from the fact that thin-\u00d8 operators\nthat are bounded in lp are (1, 1/p \u2212 1/q)-almost thin-sparse in lq for all q > p.\nThis is a consequence of the following proposition.\nProposition 7.3. Let X = (X, d) be a metric space such that balls of radius\nr have cardinality at most v(r), and let Y be a set. Fix some \u03b5 > 0 and some\nr \u2265 1. Let A = (ay,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X be a thin-\u00d8 operator of thickness \u2264 r such that\nkAkp\u2192p = 1 for some 0 < p < \u221e. Then, there is C = C(\u03b5) such that for every\nq \u2265 p + \u03b5 and every m \u2208 N, there exists a thin-sparse operator Am of thickness\n\u2264 r, sparseness \u2264 m such that\nk|A \u2212 Am |kq\u2192q \u2264\n\nCv(r)1\u22121/q\n.\nm1/p\u22121/q\n\nProof: First, let us prove the following lemma.\nLemma 7.4. Let n be a positive integer, and 0 < an \u2264 . . . \u2264 a1 such that\nPn p\ni=1 ai = 1, then for all 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, and q \u2265 p,\n!1/q\nn\nX\n(p/q)1/q (1 \u2212 p/q)1/p\u22121/q\naqi\n.\n(7.1)\n\u2264\nm1/p\u22121/q\ni=m+1\n21\n\n\fIn particular, for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists C = C(\u03b5) such that for all q \u2265 p + \u03b5,\n!1/q\nn\nX\nC\naqi\n\u2264 1/p\u22121/q .\nm\ni=m+1\nProof of the lemma. Let us find the maximum of the function\n\u03b8m,q (a1 , . . . , an ) =\n\nn\nX\n\naqi ,\n\nm+1\n\nunder the conditions\n\nn\nX\n\napi = 1,\n\ni=1\n\nand for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1,\n\nai+1 \u2212 ai \u2264 0.\n\nClaim 7.5. The maximum of \u03b8m,q is attained at (a1 , . . . , an ) such that ai = 0 for\ni \u2265 k and ai = 1/k 1/p for i < k, where k is an integer \u2265 m + 1.\nProof of the claim. First, note that since (ai ) is non-increasing, the maximum\nwill be attained when ai = aj for all i \u2264 j \u2264 m.\nOn the other hand, a straightforward application of Lagrange multipliers\nshows that \u03b8m,q cannot reach its maximum at a point (a1 , . . . , an ) such that\n0 < ai+1 < ai for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. Hence, if ai+1 < ai , then ai+1 = 0. There\nexists therefore only one such i. Let k := i + 1. Note that \u03b8m,q is not identically\nzero: hence, since the sequence (aj ) corresponds to a maximum of \u03b8m,q , k has to\nbe \u2265 m + 1. Summarizing this discussion, there exists k \u2265 m + 1 such that the\nsequence ai = 0 for i \u2265 k and ai = 1/k 1/p for i < k. \u0004\nWith the notation of the claim, we have\nmax \u03b8m,q =\n\nk\u2212m\n.\nk q/p\n\n(7.2)\n\nTo finish the proof of the Lemma, note that the derivative of k\u2212m\nwith respect to\nk q/p\nk vanishes exactly at the value m/(1 \u2212 p/q), which corresponds to a maximum.\nReplacing k by this value in (7.2) yields (7.1). \u0004\nNow, let us prove the proposition. As kAkp\u2192p = 1, for every x \u2208 X, the\ncolumn Cx = (ay,x )y\u2208Y has lp -norm at most 1. By Lemma 7.4, there exists a\nsubset Sx of Y of cardinality \u2264 m such that\nX\n|ay,x |q \u2264 C q /mq/p\u22121 .\ny\u2208Y rSx\n\n22\n\n\fNow, we define Am from A by replacing the coefficient ay,x by 0 whenever y \u2208\nY r Sx . By construction, Am is thin-sparse of thickness \u2264 r and sparseness \u2264 m.\nLet f \u2208 lq (X). Denote by Cm = |A \u2212 Am | = (cy,x )(y,x)\u2208Y \u00d7X .
