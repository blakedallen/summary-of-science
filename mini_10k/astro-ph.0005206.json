Suppose that a fraction, 1 \u2212 y, of the CDM\nparticles will decay by z = 0. Since the proposed decay\nlifetime \u03c4 is greater than t0 (the current age of the universe) and the orbital periods of particles inside r200 for\nhalos of interest, one may assume that the change in the\npotential of the halo due to CDM decay is gradual resulting\nin an adiabatic expansion of the halo. For this illustrative\nexample we also assume that the halo maintains the NFW\nprofile during expansion. We identify the \"initial\" (subscript \"i\") halo configuration with the halo configuration\nat z = 0 in the canonical \u039bCDM model, where CDM particles would have been stable, and the \"final\" (subscript \"f\")\nhalo configuration with the halo configuration at z = 0 in\nthe \u039bDCDM model. Using virial theorem it can be shown\nthat a particle at initial radius ri will move out to rf :\nrf = ri /y. The final \"core\" radius is therefore\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nWhile the canonical \u039bCDM model is remarkably successful in many ways (Ostriker & Steinhardt 1995; Bahcall\net al. 1999), there is now some tentative evidence that it\nmay have too much power on small scales (l \u223c 1\u2212100 kpc)\ntoday. Evidence includes a large excess of dwarf galaxies (Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al. 1999), the overconcentration of dark matter in dwarf galaxies (Moore\n1994; Flores & Primack 1994; Burkert 1995; McGaugh\n& de Blok 1998; Moore et al. 1999) as well as in large\ngalaxies (Navarro & Steinmetz 2000). Without impairing\nthe many notable virtues of the \u039bCDM model, in this Letter we suggest a \u039bCDM model in which one half of the\nCDM particles decay into relativistic particles by z = 0.\nDecaying CDM was suggested before in attempts to save\nthe CDM model in an Einstein-de Sitter universe (Turner,\nSteigman, & Krauss 1984; Doroshkevich & Khlopov 1984;\nOlive, Seckel, & Vishniac 1985). Suggestions were also\nmade in the context of neutrino models for similar rescue\nmissions (Davis et al. 1981; Hut & White 1984).\n\nrc,f = rc,i /y.\n\nThe mass inside r200,i /y is yM200,i by z = 0, where M200,i\nis the initial mass within r200,i , and the final density within\nr200,i /y is y 4 \u03c1200 . Defining \u2212\u03b1 as the effective slope of the\ndensity profile at \u223c r200 , we obtain r200 approximately\n\n2. DECAYING COLD DARK MATTER MODEL\n\nTo illustrate the effect of CDM decay let us examine\nhow the profile of a halo would be altered. Suppose a\npure CDM halo, formed at some high redshift zhalo , has\nan NFW (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1997) density profile\n\u03c1(r)\n\u03b4c\n=\n,\n\u03c1crit\n(r/rc )(1 + r/rc )2\n\nr200,f \u2248 y 4/\u03b1\u22121 r200,i .\n\n(1)\n\n(3)\n\nAnother way to obtain r200,f is to use equation (1) directly to solve for r\u2032 within which the initial density is\n200y \u22124\u03c1crit . The resulting equation is w(1 + ci w)2 =\ny 4 (1+ci )2 , where w = r\u2032 /r200,i . Using y = 0.5 and ci = 30\n\nwith an initial concentration parameter ci \u2261 r200,i /rc,i ,\nwhere r200 is the radius within which the mean density is\n1 Princeton\n\n(2)\n\nUniversity Observatory, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544; cen@astro.princeton.edu\n\n1\n\n\f2\none obtains w = 0.384, resulting in the final virial radius\nr200,f = 0.384y \u22121r200,i = 0.77r200,i (for y = 0.5), which\nis what equation (3) gives with \u03b1 = 2.9 (consistent with\nthe known slope of halos near r200 ). For our present purpose, we will simply adopt \u03b1 = 3 and use the analytic\nform of equation (3) for subsequent analyses. Combining\nequations (2,3) yields,\ncf = y 4/\u03b1 ci .\n\n(4)\n\nFor y = 0.5, it says ci /cf = 2.5. The circular velocity due\nto the CDM halo is (Navarro et al. 1997)\n\u0014\n\nVc (r)\nV200\n\n\u00152\n\n=\n\n1 ln(1 + cx) \u2212 (cx)/(1 + cx)\n,\nx ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere x \u2261 r/r200 = r/crc . V200,f and V200,i are related:\nV200,f = y 4/\u03b1\u22121 V200,i\n\n(6)\n\nFigure (1) shows rotation curves and mass profiles for the\ninitial and final halos (with y = 0.5). The reduction in\nVmax , c and mass of the halo, and the increase in rmax\nin the \u039bDCDM model should alleviate the density profile/concentration crisis. For example, the CDM mass\nwithin the solar circle (\u223c 0.1r200 ) will be reduced by a factor about 3.5, as seen in Figure 1. But for Milky Way like\ngalaxies where CDM mass is not dominant today within\nthe relevant radius, the reduction should be smaller, likely\nin the range 2 \u2212 3, which will bring the model into agreement with observations (Navarro & Steinmetz 2000). Detailed simulations including other important effects such\nas mergers and tidal fields should provide a more precise\nanwser. The effect of the decay of CDM particles on the\nabundance of small dwarf galaxies is also favorable. This,\nand additional attractive features as well as potential tests\nof the model, will be discussed in the next section.\n3. DISCUSSION\n\n3.1. A Fiducial \u039bDCDM Model\nLet us construct a fiducial \u039bDCDM model with the following parameters: \u03a90,CDM = 0.234 (CDM density at\nz = 0), \u03bb0 = 0.60, \u03a90,b = 0.044 (baryonic density at\nz = 0), \u03a90,r = 0.122 (relativistic matter density at z = 0)\nand h \u2261 H0 /100km/sec/Mpc= 0.60. The assumption that\none half of the CDM particles decay by z = 0 translates\ninto an exponential decay lifetime \u03c4 \u223c 1.44t0 , where t0 =\n0.84H0\u22121 is the current age of the universe (equal to 13.9\nGyrs for h = 0.60). At z >> 1 the total non-relativistic\nmatter density is \u03c1i,N R = (\u03a90,b + 2\u03a90,CDM )(1 + z)3 \u03c1crit =\n0.512(1 + z)3 \u03c1crit , where \u03c1crit is the critical density at\nz = 0. Eke et al. (1996) cluster normalization requires\n\u22120.52+0.13\u03a90,N R\nfor \u03bb0 + \u03a90,M = 1,\n\u03c38 = (0.52 \u00b1 0.04)\u03a90,N R\nwhich gives \u03c38 = 1.01 \u00b1 0.08. Strictly speaking this fitting formula does not apply to \u039bDCDM models. But we\nexpect the difference is smaller than the error bar. We\nhave amended the CMBFAST code of Seljak & Zaldarriaga to compute \u03c38 for \u039bDCDM models with Bunn &\nWhite's (1997) COBE normalization and find \u03c38 = 1.06\nfor a spectral index n = 1.\nInitially, \u0393 \u2261 \u03a9M h = 0.31, which is consistent at \u223c 1.0\u03c3\nwith the value of \u0393 = 0.24 \u00b1 0.06 derived from large-scale\n\nstructure observations (Feldman, Kaiser, & Peacock 1994).\nDue to the late decay of density fluctuations, power will\nbe transferred from small scales to large scales. This effect\nmay render an effective \u0393 at z = 0 smaller than its initial\nvalue, more consistent with observations. The universal\ndeceleration parameter q0 is found to be \u22120.38 (compared\nto \u22120.40 in the corresponding \u039b model), which is consistent with the observations of high-z SNe (Schmidt et al.\n1998). The essential parameters of the model are summarized in Table (1), where we also list a high \u03a9b model.\n3.2. More On Small Scales \u2013 Dwarf Galaxies, Low\nSurface Brightness Galaxies, Dark Galaxies\nIn the \u039bDCDM model CDM halos become less concentrated only at low redshift. It is tempting to conjecture that CDM dominated galaxies (mostly dwarf galaxies) at moderate redshift become the low surface brightness\ngalaxies in the local universe (LSBGs; Bothun et al. 1987;\nMcGaugh 1992). We suggest that the moderate-redshift\nfaint blue compact objects (FBOs; Koo 1986; Tyson 1988;\nCowie et al. 1988) are CDM dominated dwarf galaxies undergoing initial starbursts at z \u223c 1.0, and subsequently expand to become the LSBGs seen today. There are several\npieces of observational data that together provide evidence\nconsistent with this scenario. First, the number density of\nFBOs is consistent with local LSBGs (Babul & Ferguson\n1996). Second, the surface brightness of the LSBGs is\nroughly about 1.4 magnitude (i.e., a factor of 4.4) dimmer\nthan high surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs; McGaugh\n1994), which is consistent with the expectation that FBOs\nhave high surface brightness, and the expansion of size by a\nfactor of \u223c 2 just gives the indicated magnitude difference.\nThird, the LSBGs are weakly clustered (Mo, McGaugh, &\nBothun 1994), in agreement with FBOs (Efstathiou et al.\n1991); since galaxy clustering is not expected to involve\nrapidly from z = 1 to z = 0 (Katz, Hernquist, & Weinberg\n1999; Cen & Ostriker 2000), the comparison between objects at z \u223c 1 (FBOs) and at z = 0 (LSBGs) is indicative.\nWhile the connection between FBOs and LSBGs was\npreviously made by McGaugh (1994), there is a major difference between his proposal and ours. While he argues\nthat FBOs are LSBGs at high z, we require that FBOs\nbe HSBGs at high z, which subsequently evolve to LSBGs. There is some indication that our picture is in better agreement with recent HST observations (Glazebrook\net al. 2000). Furthermore, our picture of moderate-redshift\nFBOs being HSBGs would naturally enable FBOs to experience necessary initial starbursts (Lacey & Silk 1991;\nBabul & Rees 1992; Gardner et al. 1993; Lacey et al. 1993;\nKauffmann et al. 1994); local LSBGs are not starburst\ngalaxies. Babul & Ferguson (1996) have also made the\nconnection between FBOs and LSBGs based on detailed\nmodeling of the star formation history of FBOs. The major difference between our model and theirs is that we do\nnot require gas to be expelled from FBOs. It is noted that\nLSBGs are rather gas rich, not gas poor, and many LSBGs\nare fairly massive systems, for which it seems unlikely that\ngas can be easily driven out (Mac Low and Ferrara 1999).\nWe would go further to propose that there exist two\nadditional classes of some more numerous, (on average)\nlower mass CDM halos: ultra-low surface brightness galaxies (ULSBGs; Impey & Bothun 1997), and \"dark\" galaxies\n(DGs). ULSBGs have lower star formation rate than LS-\n\n\f3\nBGs, whereas DGs were never given a chance to form a\nsignificant amount of stars and were expanded away to\nremain dark. The existence of a sharp drop-off of star\nformation rate below a cut-off density (Kennicutt 1998)\nbodes well for this picture. Most of the excess number of\ndwarf halos found in N-body simulations of the \u039bCDM\nmodel will now be ULSBGs and DGs in the \u039bDCDM\nmodel. ULSBGs and DGs as well as LSBGs should be\nlow in metallicity and rich in gas.\nPeebles (1999) has repeatedly reminded us of a potential problem with CDM based models: Why are there not\nmany dwarf galaxies with escape velocities greater than\n\u223c 20km/sec in the voids, which are expected to form from\nlow \u03c3 density peaks at low redshift? One answer born\nout in our picture is that the universe today may be filled\nwith numerous LSBGs, ULSBGs, and DGs in voids (as\nwell as in some other regions). The fact that low \u03c3 smallscale density peaks are more affected by the modulation by\nlarge-scale waves, which determine the large-scale structures such as voids and clusters, implies that low \u03c3 peaks\nvirialize later in the voids than their counterparts in higher\ndensity environments; it may be that FBOs were never\nformed in voids because of halo expansion. This effect may\nhave left the voids filled with only ULSBGs and DGs, as\nobservations do not seem to find any significant excess of\nLSBGs in voids (Schombert, Pildis, & Eder 1997).\n3.3. Other Implications of the \u039bDCDM Model\n1. The fact that the \u039bDCDM model has a lower nonrelativistic matter density at z = 0 dictates a higher \u03c38\ncompared to the canonical \u039bCDM model, when both are\nnormalized to the abundance of local clusters of galaxies.\nThe shape of the power spectrum of the \u039bDCDM model is\nsimilar to that of the canonical \u039bCDM model. This, combined with a slower linear growth factor, a higher effective\n\u0393 (\u2261 \u03a9M h) and a higher non-relativistic matter density at\nhigh redshift says that \u039bDCDM model has more power on\nall scales at high redshift compared to the corresponding\n\u039bCDM model. This may prove to be attractive in light of\nthe discovery of very high redshift, very luminous quasars\n(Fan et al. 2000). On larger scales, it appears that the\ncanonical \u039bCDM model underpredicts the abundance of\nhigh temperature clusters at z \u223c 0.83 by a factor of about\nten (see Figure 1 of Bahcall & Fan 1998). The \u039bDCDM\nshould have more high-z clusters but detailed simulations\nare needed to quantify this.\n2. Galaxies at high redshift (z \u2265 1.0 \u2212 2.0) is expected\nto be smaller, on average, than local ones. In particular, there should be an excess number of small galaxies at\nz \u2265 1.0 \u2212 2.0, which may have already been seen in the\nHubble Deep Field (e.g., Giallongo et al. 2000).\n3. The comoving distance to any redshift is shorter\nin the \u039bDCDM model than in the corresponding \u039bCDM\nmodel, which lessens the constraint on \u03bb0 imposed by gravitational lensing of galaxies (Kochanek 1996).\n4. ULSBGs and DGs may make a sizable contribution to\nthe number of Lyman alpha clouds and Lyman limit systems at low redshift and they are likely to cluster around\nlarge galaxies. They could provide the source of the \"Type\n1\" population of Lyman alpha clouds at low redshift as\nproposed by Bahcall et al. (1996).\n5. It is interesting to see whether the decay of CDM particles has consequences on the dynamics of stars in our own\n\nGalaxy. A star at a galacto-centric distance r will have an\nr dM\nextra outward velocity vr = M\ndt (this is called \"K-term\"\nin galactic dynamics), which gives vr = 0.4(r/10 kpc)km/s\nfor \u03c4 = 1.44t0 (assuming CDM and baryonic mass are\nequal within the relevant radius), not inconsistent with\nobservations (e.g., Ovenden & Byl 1976).\nWe do not attempt to identify a particle physics model\nfor the decaying CDM with the designed properties, but\npossible candidates for them are heavy neutrinos that decay to light neutrinos plus majoron (Gelmini, Schramm,\n& Valle 1984), or supersymmetric models involving the\nnonradiative decay of the gravitino (Olive, Schramm, &\nSrednicki 1984). Finally, CDM decay epoch appears to\npresent another cosmic coincidence, as does the cosmological constant. We would conjecture, as the risk of being\noverly speculative, that the two parameters may be related\nat a more fundamental level.\n3.4. Tests of the \u039bDCDM Model\nOne clean test that could either falsify or confirm the\n\u039bDCDM model will come from measuring the ratio of\ngas to total mass in clusters of galaxies, Mgas /Mtot . We\npredict that Mgas /Mtot should display a trend: lower at\nhigher redshift. The ratio should be lower by 31% at z = 1\nthan at z = 0. This is a potentially observable signature by X-ray observations (e.g., Jones & Forman 1992) or\nobservations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect (e.g.,\nCarlstrom, Joy, & Grego 1996).\nSimilarly, the mass-to-light ratio for galaxies, particularly dwarf galaxies, should show a trend of increasing with\nredshift. However, complications are expected in this regard due to much more involved astrophysical processes\nconcerning star-formation. Nevertheless, attempts to try\nto detect this trend are worthwhile.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that, by allowing for one half of the\nCDM particles to decay by z = 0 into relativistic particles, the problem of excess small-scale power in the \u039bCDM\nmodel is remedied. In essence, the decay of CDM particles results in reduction of CDM mass and expansion of the\nhalo, and lowers the concentration of CDM in the inner region to brings the model into agreement with observations\nof dwarf galaxies. The problem of excess number of dwarf\ngalaxies in the \u039bCDM is solved by the same mechanism\nbut manifested in a quite different way: instead of suppressing the number of predicted dwarf halos, we argue\nthat these dwarf halos failed to form a sufficient amount\nof stars to be identified as dwarf galaxies even in our local\nneighborhood. It is important to search for these gas-rich\n(not necessarilly neutral gas-rich) dark galaxies in the Local Group. The model is consistent with COBE, the local\nabundance of rich clusters of galaxies, the age constraint\nand q0 from high-z SNe.\nA test of the model will be provided by measuring the\nevolution of gas fraction in clusters. The prediction is\nthat the gas fraction should decrease with redshift and is\nsmaller by 31% at z = 1 than at z = 0. X-ray and SZ\neffect observations should provide such a test.\nI thank Matias Zaldarriaga for help on CMBFAST\ncode, Jerry Ostriker, David Spergel, Paul Steinhardt and\n\n\f4\nMichael Strauss for very useful discussions and comments,\nJim Peebles for encouragement, Vijay Narayanan for a\nvery careful reading of the manuscript.
