We explain why this is true and\nwhat consequences this has on an abstract theory of Weyl groups in groups\nof finite Morley rank.\n\nThe only known infinite simple groups of finite Morley rank are the simple\nalgebraic groups over algebraically closed fields and this is a motivation, among\nmany others, for a classification project of these groups. It borrows ideas and\ntechniques from the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups but at the same\ntime it may provide, sometimes, a kind of simplified version of the finite case.\nThis is mostly due to the existence of well-behaved notions of genericity and connectivity in the infinite case, which unfortunately have no direct finite analogs.\nThe present note deals with a very specific and technical topic concerning\nsuch arguments based on genericity in the case of infinite groups of finite Morley rank, which serve here to bypass allegro potential complications of various\nnature, including finite combinatorics. As a result, we show similarities with\nalgebraic groups in any case as far as a theory of Weyl groups is concerned, and\nnaturally this applies also to non-algebraic configurations which are encountered\nthroughout much of the current work in the area.\nIn a connected reductive algebraic group, maximal (algebraic) tori are conjugate and cover the group generically, with the Weyl group governing essentially\nthe structure of the entire group. In the abstract context, we use the term \"generous\" to speak of a subset \"whose union of conjugates is generic in the group\",\nthe typical property of tori in the classical algebraic case. There are at least\ntwo abstract versions of tori in groups of finite Morley rank, which coincide at\nleast in the case of a reductive algebraic group, decent tori on the one hand and\nCarter subgroups on the other. The main caveat with these two more abstract\nnotions for a seemingly complete analogy with algebraic groups is in both cases\nan unknown existence, more precisely the existence of a nontrivial decent torus\non the one hand and the existence of a generous Carter subgroup on the other.\nAnyway, here we follow an approach resolutely adapted to the second notion.\nWith both notions there are conjugacy theorems, the conjugacy of maximal\ndecent tori [Che05] and of generous Carter subgroups [Jal06]. This gives a\nnatural notion of Weyl group in each case, N (T )/C \u25e6 (T ) for some maximal\n1\n\n\fdecent torus T or N (Q)/Q for some generous Carter subgroup Q. In any case\nand whatever the Weyl group is, it is finite and, as with classical Weyl groups\nand algebraic tori in algebraic groups, its determination and its action on the\nunderlying subgroup is fundamental in the abstract context.\nAs an element of the Weyl group is a coset in the ambient group, it is then\nuseful to get a description of such cosets, even though recovering from such\na description the structure and the action of the Weyl group is in general a\nparticularly delicate task. This is mostly due to the fact that, in practice, one\ncan only get a generic, and thus weak, description of the coset. In [CJ04] such\narguments were however developed intensively, and this was highly influenced\nby one of the most critical aspects of the early work, notably by Nesin, on the socalled \"bad\" groups of finite Morley rank ([BN94, Theorem 13.3]). In this paper,\na pathological coset, whose representative is typically a Weyl element which\nshould not exist, is usually shown to be both generous and nongenerous, and\nthen the coset does not exist. This is the main protocol, sometimes refered to as\n\"coset arguments\", for the limitation of the size of the Weyl group. Generosity\nis usually obtained by unexpected commutations between the Weyl elements\nand the underlying subgroup, and in general this may depend on the specific\nconfiguration considered. It is certainly the pathological property in any case,\nand we shall prove here at a reasonable level of generality that the existing\ncosets should be nongenerous.\nIn particular, we rearrange as follows the protocol of [CJ04] in the light of\nfurther developments of [Jal06] concerning generosity.\nTheorem 1 (Generix and the Cosets) Let G be a connected group of finite\nMorley rank in which, generically, elements belong to connected nilpotent subgroups. Then the coset wH is not generous for any definable subgroup H and\nany element w normalizing H but not in H.\nThe assumption on the generic elements of G in Theorem 1 can take several\nforms, and we will explain this shortly. The most typical case where Theorem 1\napplies is however the case in which H = Q is a generous Carter subgroup of G.\nIn particular, the present paper is also an appendix of [Jal06] on the structure\nof groups of finite Morley rank with such a generous Carter subgroup, and more\nprecisely a follow-up to Section 3.3 in that paper.\nThe general idea of the protocol of [CJ04] has been used repeatedly in various\ncontexts, most notably to get a fine description of p-torsion in terms of connected\nnilpotent subgroups of bounded exponent and of decent tori [BC07]. Applied\nto the most natural kind of Weyl groups, the protocol shows that centralizers of\ndecent tori are connected in any connected group, implying in particular that\nthe Weyl group N (T )/C \u25e6 (T ) attached to a decent torus T acts faithfully on T .\nThis corresponds to the most typical and smooth applications of the protocol\nin [CJ04], generally a lemma expedited at the early stage of the analysis of each\nconfiguration considered there. With [Che05] and [Jal06], and eventually the\nfiniteness of conjugacy classes of uniformly definable families of decent tori of\n[FJ08, Theorem 6.4], it became clear that, for that specific lemma, the protocol\n2\n\n\fhad implementations autonomous from these specific configurations. Proofs\nmay have appeared in [AB08, Fre07b], with a conceptually better and more\ngeneral implementation in the second case but, regrettably, with no connection\nat all to [CJ04] in both cases.\nA much more delicate use of the protocol can be found in [CJ04, Proposition\n6.17]. It is proved there, still in a specific configuration, that the centralizer of\na certain finite subgroup of a decent torus is connected, with then a much more\nrestrictive faithful action of the Weyl group. As this special application of the\nprotocol contains the main difficulty possibly inherent to the subject, we mostly\nrefer to this example. As we will see below, the key point is that generosity is\nin general related to a finiteness property, as opposed to a uniqueness property,\na delicate aspect treated \"by hand\" in [CJ04, Proposition 6.17] and much more\nconceptually here.\nTheorem 1 has general consequences on the action of the Weyl group on the\nunderlying subgroup, again whatever these are. Back to the concrete example\nof a reductive algebraic group, the maximal algebraic torus is a divisible abelian\nsubgroup, and the Weyl group acts faithfully on it. The main corollary of\nTheorem 1 is a general form of this in the abstract context of groups of finite\nMorley rank.\nCorollary 2 Let G be a connected group of finite Morley rank in which, generically, elements belong to connected nilpotent subgroups. Suppose that H is a\ndefinable connected generous subgroup, that w is an element normalizing H but\nnot in H, of finite order n modulo H, and that {hn | h \u2208 H} is generic in H.\nThen CH (w) < H.\nIn the case of a connected reductive algebraic group, the subgroup H in\nCorollary 2 is typically the maximal torus T and w a representative of a nontrivial element of order n of the Weyl group. In the finite Morley rank case,\nH may typically be a generous n-divisible Carter subgroup Q, and w a representative of a nontrivial element of order n of the Weyl group N (Q)/Q. One\ngets then, for instance if Q is a divisible abelian generous Carter subgroup as in\nCorollary 14 below, consequences qualitatively similar in the finite Morley rank\ncase.\nAs for Theorem 1, the statement adopted in Corollary 2 is far more general\nthan what it says about this typical case. Less typical applications can be\nfound in [DJ07, \u00a74.2] in the context of connected locally\u25e6 solvable\u25e6 groups, the\nsmallest class of groups of finite Morley rank containing connected solvable\ngroups and Chevalley groups of type PSL 2 and SL 2 over algebraically closed\nfields. Besides, the reader can find there a form of Theorem 1, actually weaker,\nbut which reformats uniformly and in a hopefully informative way the original\narguments of [CJ04] in this context of \"small\" groups.\n\n3\n\n\f1\n\nTechnicalities and environment\n\nBefore passing to the proofs, we review briefly the background needed, or surrounding.\nGroups of finite Morley rank are equipped with a rudimentary notion of finite\ndimension on their definable sets, satisfying as axioms a few basic properties of\nthe natural dimension of varieties in algebraic geometry over algebraically closed\nfields. By definable we mean definable by a first-order logic formula, possibly\nwith parameters and possibly in quotients by definable equivalence relations.\nThe dimension, or \"rank\", of a definable set A is denoted by rk (A).\nThe finiteness of the rank implies the descending chain condition on definable\nsubgroups, and this naturally gives abstract versions of classical notions of the\ntheory of algebraic groups:\n\u2022 The definable hull of an arbitrary subset of the ambient group is the smallest definable subgroup containing that set. It is contained in the Zariski\nclosure in the case of an algebraic group.\n\u2022 The connected component G\u25e6 of a group G of finite Morley rank is the\nsmallest (normal) definable subgroup of finite index of G, and G is connected when G = G\u25e6 .\nA fundamental property of a connected group of finite Morley rank is that\nit cannot be partitioned into two definable generic subsets, that is two subsets\nof maximal rank [Che79]. Our arguments make full use of the following simpler\nproperties.\nFact 3\n(1) A connected group of finite Morley rank acting definably on a finite set\nmust fix it pointwise.\n(2) A connected group of finite Morley rank acting definably on a group H of\nfinite Morley rank induces a trivial action on H/H \u25e6 .\nProof. The first item is a well known application of connectedness: as elements\nof the base set have finite orbits, their (definable) stabilizers are of finite index,\nand hence cannot be proper. The second item is a special case of the first which\ndoes not seem to be specifically mentioned in the literature: as H \u25e6 is definably\ncharacteristic in H, the acting group induces an action on H/H \u25e6 , and we are\nthen in presence of the action of a connected group on a finite set.\n\u0003\nFollowing [Jal06], we say that a definable subset of a group G of finite Morley\nrank is generous in G when the union of its G-conjugates is generic in G. In\nour proof of Theorem 1, we are essentially going to reuse lines of arguments of\n[Jal06] for dealing with generosity, both for characterizing it and for applying\nit. When working with generosity in very general contexts, one has to inspect\nclosely each conjugacy class of each individual element of the set considered.\n4\n\n\fThe reader can find in [Jal06, \u00a72.2] such an analysis, done there for definable\nconnected subgroups. Another approach for this analysis was mentioned to\nthe author by Cherlin, with a more conceptual geometric proof, duale in some\nsense, giving also a few more rank equalities. We take here the opportunity\nto recast these computations in terms of permutation groups, not only because\nit generalizes naturally, but also as it certainly might be useful in this more\ngeneral context.\nGiven a permutation group (G, \u03a9) and a subset H of \u03a9, we denote by N (H)\nand by C(H) the setwise and the pointwise stabilizer of H respectively, that is\nG{H} and G(H) in a usual permutation group theory notation. We also denote\nby H G the set {hg | (h, g) \u2208 H \u00d7 G}, where hg denotes the image of h under\nthe action of g, as in the case of an action by conjugation. Subsets of the form\nH g for some g in G are also called G-conjugates of H. Notice that the set H G\ncan be seen, alternatively, as the union of G-orbits of elements of H, or also\nas the union of G-conjugates of H. When considering the action of a group on\nitself by conjugation, as we will do below, all these terminologies and notations\nare the usual ones, with N (H) and C(H) the normalizer and the centralizer of\nH respectively.\nWe note that in this paper we work only with \"exact\" normalizers N (H) =\n{g \u2208 G | H g = H}, or \"stabilizers\", as opposed to \"generic stabilizers\", where\nthe equality H g = H is understood up to a symmetric difference of lower rank.\nFact 4 [Jal06, Proposition 2.9] Let (G, \u03a9) be a ranked permutation group,\nH a definable subset of \u03a9, and assume that for r between 0 and rk (G/N (H))\nthe definable subset Hr of H, consisting of those elements of H belonging to a\nset of G-conjugates of H of rank exactly r, is nonempty. Then\nrk (Hr G ) = rk (G) + rk (Hr ) \u2212 rk (N (H)) \u2212 r.\nProof. One may proceed exactly as in the geometric proof of [Jal06, Proposition\n2.9]. In the natural geometry associated to this computation, points are the\nelements of \u03a9 which are G-conjugate to those of H and lines are the G-conjugates\nof H. The set of flags is the set of couples (point,line) where the point belongs to\nthe line, and one considers the subflag naturally associated to Hr . Projecting on\nthe set of points one gets rk (Hr G ) + r for the rank of this subflag, and similarly\nrk (G/N (H)) + rk (Hr ) by projecting on the set of lines. The equality follows.\nIn this proof we use essentially only two properties of the rank. The first\none is a guarantee that the sets Hr considered are definable. The second one\nis a guarantee of the two formulas as above for the rank of a set, as the sum\nof the rank of its image by a definable function and of the rank of the fibers of\nthat function, when constant. These two properties correspond respectively to\nthe definability and the additivity of the rank in the Borovik-Poizat axioms for\nranked structures [BN94, \u00a74].\n\u0003\nIn the context of a permutation group as in Fact 4, we may naturally say that\nthe definable subset H of \u03a9 is generous when the subset H G of \u03a9 is generic in \u03a9.\n5\n\n\fOf course, this matches with the usual definition in the case of the action of a\ngroup on itself by conjugation. Continuing in the general context of permutation\ngroups, Fact 4 has the following corollary characterizing generosity.\nCorollary 5 Assume furthermore rk (G) = rk (\u03a9) and rk (H) \u2264 rk (N (H)) in\nFact 4. Then H G is generic in \u03a9 if and only if rk (H0 ) = rk (N (H)). In this\ncase rk (H0 ) = rk (H) = rk (N (H)), a generic element of \u03a9 lies in only finitely\nmany conjugates of H, and the same applies to a generic element of H.\nProof. If H G is generic in \u03a9, then one has for some r as in Fact 4 that Hr G is\ngeneric in \u03a9, and then\n0 \u2264 r = rk (Hr ) \u2212 rk (N (H)) \u2264 rk (H) \u2212 rk (N (H)) \u2264 0,\nshowing that all these quantities are equal to 0. In particular r = 0, and\nrk (H0 ) = rk (N (H)). Conversely, if rk (H0 ) = rk (N (H)), then rk (H0 G ) =\nrk (G) = rk (\u03a9) by Fact 4.\nFor our last statement, we also see with the above inequalities that rk (H) =\nrk (N (H)), and as H0 and N (H) have the same rank it follows that rk (H0 ) =\nrk (H) = rk (N (H)). In particular the definable subset H0 of H is generic in H,\nand together with the genericity of H0 G in \u03a9 this is exactly the meaning of our\ntwo last claims.\n\u0003\nWe stress the fact that, under the circumptances of Corollary 5, the generosity of H is equivalent to the genericity of the definable sets H0 and H0 G\nin H and \u03a9 respectively, so that working with these definable sets avoids troublesome saturation issues. At this point, it is also worth mentioning that there\nare uniform bounds on finite sets throughout. This is one of the Borovik-Poizat\naxioms, usually called elimination of infinite quantifiers, which gives uniform\nbounds on the cardinals of finite sets in uniformly definable families of sets.\nThis is used on rather rare occasions, and could also be used here to see the\ndefinability of sets like H0 in Fact 4 and Corollary 5: H0 is exactly the set of\nelements of H contained in at most m distinct conjugates of H, for some fixed\nfinite m. We will not use it as the definability of the rank amply suffices here,\nbut this aspect can of course be kept in mind.\nA typical case in which Fact 4 and Corollary 5 apply is the case in which the\npermutation group (G, \u03a9) is interpretable in a group G of finite Morley rank.\nIn the rest of this paper we are only going to consider the action of a group of\nfinite Morley rank on itself by conjugation, so Fact 4 and Corollary 5 will be\napplied freely.\nAs G and \u03a9 are the same is this case, the extra assumption rk (G) = rk (\u03a9)\nis then automatically satisfied in the characteristion of generosity of Corollary\n5. The second assumption rk (H) \u2264 rk (N (H)) is not satisfied in general, but\nan interesting case in which it holds is the case in which H has the form x\u0393,\nwhere \u0393 is a definable subgroup of G and x is an element of G normalizing \u0393: in\nthis case \u0393 \u2264 N (x\u0393), and thus rk (x\u0393) = rk (\u0393) \u2264 rk (N (x\u0393)). In fact, one sees\n6\n\n\fin this case that N (x\u0393) is exactly the preimage in N (\u0393) of CN (\u0393)/\u0393 (x mod \u0393).\nAll cosets considered in this paper are of this type, and we will make full use\nof Corollary 5 when considering the generosity of such cosets in the rest of the\npaper.\nWe insist again on the fact that the characterisation of Corollary 5 is in this\ncase essentially the genericity of H0 in H (in addition to rk (H) = rk (N (H))),\nand thus the fact that only finitely many conjugates of H pass through a generic\nelement of H. In general, and we would like to say with probability almost one,\nthere is not uniqueness. It may be seen by considering the generic element g of\na connected reductive algebraic group. It lies in a maximal torus T , which lies\nin a generous Borel subgroup B; T is the unique of its conjugates containing g\n([Jal06, Corollary 3.8]), but there are several conjugates of B containing g (and\npermuted by the Weyl group N (T )/T ).\nThat's all about the background we will use. We do not use decent tori\nand Carter subgroups in the present work, Theorem 1 and Corollary 2, but,\nas they correspond so closely to its most typical applications, it may be useful\nto recall their definitions and to place more precisely our results in context.\nA decent torus T of a group of finite Morley rank is a definable (connected)\ndivisible abelian subgroup which coincides with the definable hull of its (divisible\nabelian) torsion subgroup, and a Carter subgroup Q is a definable connected\nnilpotent subgroup of finite index in its normalizer (and in particular it satisfies\nQ = N \u25e6 (Q)). Both types of subgroups exist in any group of finite Morley rank,\nwhich is trivial in the first case and follows in the second case from a graduated\nnotion of unipotence on certain connected nilpotent subgroups, for which decent\ntori are precisely the first stones [FJ08, \u00a73.1]. By [Che05], maximal decent tori\nare conjugate in any group of finite Morley rank, which indeed follows from the\nfact that C \u25e6 (T ) is generous for any such decent torus T . By [Jal06], generous\nCarter subgroups are conjugate in any group of finite Morley rank.\nWe take this opportunity to mention the following corelation between decent\ntori and generous Carter subgroups.\nFact 6 If Q is a generous Carter subgroup of a group of finite Morley rank, then\nT \u2264 Q \u2264 C \u25e6 (T ) for some maximal decent torus T , and N (T ) = C \u25e6 (T ) * N (Q).\nActually, we will prove something slightly more general than Fact 6, expanding a bit the existing theory of generous subgroups in passing.\nRecall first that the existence of a generous Carter subgroup is, maybe, the\nmain open question at the moment concerning groups of finite Morley rank. It is\nequivalent to the question to know whether any connected group of finite Morley\nrank containing no proper definable connected generous subgroup is nilpotent\n(see [Jal06, Genericity Conjecture 4.1 b\u2013\u03b2]). As in [Jal06, \u00a74.2], a minimal\ncounterexample to the question of existence of a generous Carter subgroup in\nconnected groups has tendency to be semisimple, i.e., with all its normal solvable\nsubgroups trivial, and has no proper definable connected generous subgroups.\nFact 7 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank.\n\n7\n\n\f(1) If Q is a definable nilpotent subgroup of G, then any definable subgroup of\nQ generous in G is of finite index in Q.\n(2) If Q and H are definable subgroups of G\u25e6 generous in G, with Q nilpotent,\nthen Q\u25e6 \u2264 H \u25e6 up to conjugacy.\n(3) If Q is a generous Carter subgroup of G, then Q is, up to conjugacy, the\nunique minimal definable subgroup of G\u25e6 generous in G.\nProof. (1). Assume H is a definable subgroup of Q, generous in G. Then H\nmust be of finite index in its normalizer, by [Jal06, Lemma 2.2] or more generally\nCorollary 5. Now by normalizer condition in infinite nilpotent groups of finite\nMorley rank, H is of finite index in Q.\n(2). By Corollary 5 and connectedness of G\u25e6 , a generic element of G\u25e6 , say g,\nis in conjugates of Q and H, say Q and H, and in only finitely many such conjugates. Now by [Jal06, Fundamental Lemma 3.3], N \u25e6 (Q\u2229H) \u2264 N \u25e6 (Q) \u2229 N \u25e6 (H),\nand as N \u25e6 (Q) = Q\u25e6 and N \u25e6 (H) = H \u25e6 by generosity of Q and H (using again\n[Jal06, Lemma 2.2] or Corollary 5), we get N \u25e6 (Q \u2229H) \u2264 (Q \u2229H)\u25e6 . In particular\nQ \u2229 H has finite index in its normalizer in Q, and is thus of finite index in Q\nby normalizer condition in infinite nilpotent groups of finite Morley rank. In\nparticular, Q\u25e6 \u2264 H \u25e6 .\n(3). By (1) and connectedness of Q, Q is minimal for the generosity of\ndefinable subgroups of G\u25e6 . By (2), any definable generous subgroup H of G\u25e6\ncontains a conjugate of Q, i.e., Q \u2264 H \u25e6 up to conjugacy. Hence item (3) follows\nfrom the conjugacy of generous Carter subgroups of [Jal06].\n\u0003\nThe core of the proof of Fact 7 (2) may seem to be somehow hidden in the\nuse of [Jal06, Fundamental Lemma 3.3], which essentially relies on Fact 3 (1).\nFortunately, our proof of Theorem 1 below will reproduce the content of that\nlemma, with cosets instead of subgroups.\nFact 7 (3) provides a way to see generous Carter subgroups in the ostensibly\nwider class of minimal definable generous subgroups, where the problem of\nexistence somehow shifts to the problem of conjugacy.\nWe now add decent tori into the picture.\nFact 8 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank.\n(1) If H is a definable generous subgroup of G\u25e6 , then H \u25e6 contains a maximal\ndecent torus T of G.\n(2) If H is a definable connected generous subgroup of G, minimal with respect\nto this property, and T is a maximal decent torus of G in H, then T \u2264\nZ(H).\n(3) If T is a maximal decent torus and C \u25e6 (T ) contains a unique minimal\ndefinable generous subgroup up to conjugacy, say H, then N (T ) = C \u25e6 (T ) *\nN (H).\n8\n\n\fProof. (1). By [Che05], C \u25e6 (T ) is generous for any decent torus T of G. Arguing\nas in the proof of Fact 7 (2), one finds a generic element in C \u25e6 (T ) \u2229 H and one\ndeduces similarly that N \u25e6 (C \u25e6 (T ) \u2229 H) \u2264 N \u25e6 (C \u25e6 (T )) \u2229 N \u25e6 (H) = C \u25e6 (T ) \u2229 H \u25e6 .\nAs T is central in C \u25e6 (T ), this implies in particular that T \u2264 H \u25e6 .\n\u25e6\n(2). By [Che05], CH\n(T ) is generous in H. By transitivity of the generosity of\n\u25e6\ndefinable subgroups [Jal06, Lemma 3.9 a], one deduces that CH\n(T ) is generous\n\u25e6\nin G, and the minimality of H forces CH (T ) = H, i.e., T \u2264 Z(H).\n(3). We have T \u2264 NC\u25e6 \u25e6 (T ) (H) = H \u25e6 by generosity of H in C \u25e6 (T ), and thus\nT \u2264 Z(H). In particular, N (H) \u2264 N (T ). Now a Frattini Argument gives\nthe desired decomposition: if w \u2208 N (T ), then H and H w are two minimal\ndefinable generous subgroups of C \u25e6 (T ), H w = H \u03b1 for some \u03b1 in C \u25e6 (T ), and\nw = w\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1 \u2208 N (H) * C \u25e6 (T ). Notice that C \u25e6 (T ) is normal in N (T ).\n\u0003\nFact 6 follows from Facts 7 and 8, together with the remark that the generous\nCarter subgroup Q of G, containing the maximal decent torus T , must also be\ngenerous in C \u25e6 (T ) (by [Jal06, Lemma 2.3] or Corollary 5).\nIn presence of a nontrivial maximal decent torus T , the Weyl group of an\narbitrary group of finite Morley rank is naturally defined as in [CJ04, Theorem\n1.8] as N (T )/C \u25e6 (T ), and in presence of a generous Carter subgroup Q, it is\ndefined as in [Jal06, \u00a73.3] as N (Q)/Q. In the first case the original definition\nrelied on a particular decent subtorus related to the prime p = 2, but since the\nfull proof of conjugacy of maximal decent tori of [Che05] it naturally takes this\nform. We also mention that the term \"Weyl group\" made his first appearance,\nbeyond the classical algebraic case, in [Nes89] in the context of \"bad\" groups of\nMorley rank 3, with all possible definitions equivalent in this case.\nIn Fact 6, we see that both notions of Weyl group essentially match, with\nhowever\nN (T )/C \u25e6 (T ) \u2243 (N (Q)/Q)/(NC \u25e6 (T ) (Q)/Q)\nisomorphic to a possibly proper quotient of N (Q)/Q, and thus a sharper notion\nwith the second definition. Hence when both definitions are possible we prefer\nthe second one, though the question of equality in general is an interesting issue.\nWe note that everything said here with a decent torus T can be stated\nsimilarly with a pseudo-torus T , a slightly more general notion of torus with\npractically the same properties [Fre07b].\nBesides, we note that [Fr\u00e907a] provides an analysis of non-generous Carter\nsubgroups in very specific inductive contexts for groups of finite Morley rank.\nThis yields the conjugacy of such non-generous Carter subgroups, and eventually\ngives in these specific cases the full conjugacy of Carter subgroups, in the nongenerous case as well as in the generous case. In particular, this gives a notion\nof Weyl group in the most pathological situation in which all Carter subgroups\nwould be non-generous, the line antipodal to the one pursed in [Jal06] and,\nseemingly, here.\nIn Theorem 1 we assume that, generically, elements of the ambient group\nhave a prescribed property: to be in a connected nilpotent subgroup. As this\nproperty has no first-order character, this can be interpreted in two possible\n9\n\n\fways. It means either that the group is saturated and that realizations of\nthe generic type have that property, or, more strongly but with no saturation\nassumption, that the ambient group has a definable generic subset, all of whose\nelements have the property. This \"generic property\" is known to be true, in this\nsecond form, in the specific case of connected locally\u25e6 solvable of finite Morley\nrank, the smallest class containing connected solvable groups of finite Morley\nrank and Chevalley groups of type PSL 2 over algebraically closed fields (see\n[BBC07, Proposition 8.1], and [DJ07, \u00a75.3] for an account on this and related\ntopics). In any case, the assumption in Theorem 1 is much weaker than that\nof the existence of a generous Carter subgroup, and as the former is known in\ncontexts where the latter is not known, it seems relevant at present to state\nTheorem 1, and its consequences, under this weak assumption.\n\n2\n\nCosets and generosity\n\nIn the present section we pass to the proof of the technical Theorem 1 on\ngenerous cosets, and in the next we will see its main corollary on Weyl groups.\nIn most applications of the general protocol for computing Weyl groups in\ngroups of finite Morley rank, there is a uniqueness property, and then rank computations for generosity, or non-generosity, follow more or less immediately from\nthe presence of disjoint unions. We refer for example to [CJ04, 3.3-3.4], which\nwas essentially extracted from the original works on bad groups [BN94, Theorem\n13.3, Claim (d)]. In general, one can use only finiteness instead of uniqueness\nfor generosity, as explained and illustrated abundantly after Corollary 5. The\nreader can find in [CJ04, Proposition 6.17] a concrete application of the protocol for Weyl groups which uses finiteness only (see actually the preparatory\nsequence 6.13-6.16, and more specifically 3.16, in that paper), and we give here\na much more conceptual treatment of this aspect via Corollary 5.\nRecall that G is a connected group of finite Morley rank in which, generically, elements belong to connected nilpotent subgroups, that H is a definable\nsubgroup of G and w is an element in N (H) \\ H, and we want to show that wH\nis not generous in G.\nProof of Theorem 1. Assume towards a contradiction wH generous in G.\nWe may freely apply Corollary 5 to the coset wH, as remarked after that\ncorollary. It follows that rk (wH) = rk (N (wH)) on the one hand, and, on the\nother hand, that wH has a definable generic subset, generous in G, all of whose\nelements can lie in only finitely many conjugates of wH. In this sense, a generic\nelement g of G is, up to conjugacy, a generic element of wH, and contained\nin only finitely many conjugates of wH. Of course, N (wH) \u2264 N (H), and in\nfact N (wH) is the preimage in N (H) of CN (H)/H (w mod H). As H, wH, and\nN (wH) have the same rank,\nN \u25e6 (wH) = H \u25e6 .\nIn particular one sees also that w has finite order modulo H.\n10\n\n\fBy assumption, a generic element g of G also belongs to a connected nilpotent subgroup Q and, as taking definable hulls does not affect connectedness\nand nilpotence of subgroups in group of finite Morley rank, we may assume Q\ndefinable. (We note here that the generic property in G holds either for the\nrealizations of the generic type in case of saturation of G, or on all elements of\na definable generic subset of G, if such a subset exists.)\nUsing the connectedness of G, one concludes from the two preceding paragraphs that a generic element g of G is, on the one hand, in wH (up to conjugacy) and in only finitely many of its conjugates, and, on the other hand, in\na definable connected nilpotent subgroup Q. We will get a contradiction from\nthis position of tightrope walker of g.\nAs g \u2208 wH \u2229 Q, we may also assume w in Q, replacing the original representative w of the coset wH by a representative in Q in necessary. This is possible\nas we may take g. Then\nwH \u2229 Q = w(H \u2229 Q).\nNotice that w still has finite order modulo H \u2229 Q, as the original w had that\nproperty modulo H. The group hwi(H \u2229 Q) is in particular definable, and\n(H \u2229 Q)\u25e6 is exactly its connected component. From now on we concentrate on\nthe definable subgroup hwi(H \u2229 Q) of Q, and to its normalizer in Q.\n\u25e6\nNQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) acts by conjugation on the definable subgroup hwi(H \u2229 Q).\nBy Fact 3 (2), it induces a trivial action on this group modulo its connected\ncomponent, that is (H \u2229 Q)\u25e6 . This means that it normalizes each coset of\n\u25e6\n(H \u2229Q)\u25e6 in hwi(H \u2229Q). In particular, NQ\n(hwi(H \u2229Q)) normalizes the (possibly\nlarger) coset w(H \u2229 Q).\nAt this point we use an argument similar to the one used in [Jal06, Fundamental Lemma 3.3]. We denote by X the set of elements of w(H \u2229 Q) contained\nin only finitely many conjugates of wH. We note that the set X is not empty,\nas it contains the generic element g. We also note that the subset X of wH\ncan be contained in only finitely many conjugates of wH, as it contains the\n\u25e6\nelement g which has this property. As NQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) normalizes w(H \u2229 Q), it\nalso normalizes X, and thus it permutes by conjugation the conjugates of wH\ncontaining X. We are now in presence of the definable action of a connected\ngroup on a finite set, and it follows from Fact 3 (1) that it has a trivial action,\n\u25e6\nor in other words that NQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) normalizes each of these finitely many\nconjugates of wH containing X. In particular, it normalizes wH.\nHence\n\u25e6\nNQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) \u2264 N \u25e6 (wH) = H \u25e6 ,\n\u25e6\nas noticed earlier, and the definable connected subgroup NQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) of Q\nthen satisfies\n\u25e6\nNQ\n(hwi(H \u2229 Q)) \u2264 (H \u25e6 \u2229 Q)\u25e6 \u2264 (H \u2229 Q)\u25e6 .\n\nBut as (H \u2229Q)\u25e6 is exactly the connected component of hwi(H \u2229Q), this inclusion\nshows that hwi(H \u2229 Q) has finite index in its normalizer in Q. Now definable\nsubgroups of infinite index of nilpotent groups of finite Morley rank are of infinite\n11\n\n\findex in their normalizers, by the classical finite Morley rank version of the\nnormalizer condition in finite nilpotent groups. On finds thus that hwi(H \u2229 Q)\nhas finite index in Q, and by connectedness of the latter one gets\nQ = hwi(H \u2229 Q).\nAs (H \u2229 Q) now has finite index in Q, one gets similarly\nQ = (H \u2229 Q).\nAt this point one gets a contradiction, either by noticing that w has been\npushed inside H, or that g has been pushed outside Q.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1 has the following slightly more general form, where the connectedness of the ambient group is dropped and the possibly insinuated saturation\nassumption is slightly weakened. We note that in this corollary we do not require\nthe elementary extension to be saturated itself, but simply that it is satisfies\nthe same assumption as in Theorem 1.\nCorollary 9 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank having an elementary extension G\u2217 in which, generically, elements belong to connected nilpotent subgroups.\nThen the coset wH is not generous in G for any definable subgroup H of G\u25e6\nand any element w in NG\u25e6 (H) \\ H.\nProof. Assume towards a contradiction wH generous in G. As G is a finite\nunion of translates of G\u25e6 , wH is generous in G\u25e6 . As the rank can only go\nup when passing to an elementary extension, one then sees that the canonical\nextension [wH]\u2217 of wH, in [G\u2217 ]\u25e6 = [G\u25e6 ]\u2217 , is generous in [G\u2217 ]\u25e6 . Now one can\napply Theorem 1 in [G\u2217 ]\u25e6 .\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 1 also has the following desirable application.\nCorollary 10 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank as in Corollary 9 and let\nH be a definable subgroup of G\u25e6 . Then H \\ H \u25e6 is not generous in G and, if H is\ngenerous in G, then H \u25e6 is generous in G, and in fact in any definable subgroup\ncontaining it.\nProof. As H \\ H \u25e6 is a finite union of cosets of H \u25e6 normalizing H \u25e6 , the first\nclaim follows from Corollary 9. Now H \u25e6 must be generous in G whenever H is,\nand our last claim is [Jal06, Lemma 3.9] or Corollary 5.\n\u0003\n\nIn particular, when Corollary 10 applies in a connected group of finite Morley\nrank, then the notion of minimal definable generous subgroup, as in Facts 7 or\n8, is the same as the notion of minimal definable connected generous subgroup.\n\n12\n\n\f3\n\nCosets and action\n\nAs stressed in the introduction, recovering the action of a Weyl group on its\nunderlying subgroup from weak information on the elements of the corresponding cosets is a particularly delicate task. Corollary 2 is however a general result\nof faithfulness following merely from the nongenerosity provided by Theorem 1.\nThe rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of Corollary 2, or rather of what\nwe see as the most interesting intermediary steps.\nThe most general situation is that of a definable connected generous subgroup H, and we want to examine the action of N (H)/H on H, and much\nmore generally the action on H of elements w in N (H). Typically, H may be a\ngenerous Carter subgroup, with then N (H)/H the natural Weyl group, and w\na representative of any coset of H in N (H).\nWe note that a definable generous subgroup H always satisfies\nN \u25e6 (H) = H \u25e6\nby Corollary 5, and is in particular of finite index in its normalizer. We note\nalso that there is a basic result of lifting of torsion in groups of finite Morley\nrank, implying in particular that any element of finite order of N (H)/H lifts\nto an element of N (H) of finite order (and where the primes involved in both\nprimary decompositions are the same). In particular, choosing an element w of\nfinite order, for example as in Corollary 2, is always a low cost possibility.\nThe following lemma is the natural continuation of [CJ04, Lemma 3.4] with\nthe present much better understanding of generosity as a finiteness property\nas opposed to a uniqueness property. It is the finest corelation one can get\nbetween generic elements of the coset wH and generic elements of H in the\ntypical situation where the conclusion of Theorem 1 holds. It shows, we think,\nthe real power of the method.\nLemma 11 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank, H a definable generous\nsubgroup of G, and w an element in N (H) \\ H such that hwiH \\ H is not\ngenerous. Then\n(1) The coset wH has a definable subset [wH]gen , whose complement is nongeneric in wH, and all of whose elements are in infinitely many conjugates\nof wH.\n(2) The subgroup H has a definable generic subset Hgen such that, for any x\nin [wH]gen , the subgroup of hwiH containing x and defined as\n\\\n[hwiH]g\ng\u2208G, x\u2208[wH]g\n\nhas an empty intersection with (Hgen )G .\nProof. As N \u25e6 (H) = H \u25e6 by generosity of H and Corollary 5, rk (wH) =\nrk (N (wH)), and the first claim follows from the nongenerosity of wH by Corollary 5. Again we remark that the sets provided by Corollary 5 are definable.\n13\n\n\fNow one can apply Corollary 5 to hwiH also. The generosity of hwiH\n(following that of H) then gives a definable subset [hwiH]0 , generic in hwiH,\nand all of whose elements can lie in only finitely many conjugates of hwiH. If\nthat set had a nongeneric intersection with H, then it would have a generic\nintersection with one of the proper cosets of H in hwiH, say w\u2032 H. As all\nelements lying in this intersection would be contained in only finitely many\nconjugates of w\u2032 H, as contained in only finitely many conjugates of hwiH and\nall normalizers are finite modulo H \u25e6 , Corollary 5 would give the generosity of\nw\u2032 H, a contradiction to the assumption that hwiH \\ H is not generous. One\nmay thus consider a generic element of H as an element of Hgen := H \u2229 [hwiH]0 ,\nand thus with the property that it is in only finitely many conjugates of hwiH.\nConsider now x generic in wH in the sense of the first claim, i.e., such\nthat x is in infinitely many conjugates of wH. The intersection of subgroups\nconsidered in our second claim is a subgroup of hwiH. It is contained in infinitely\nmany conjugates hwiH, again as all normalizers are finite modulo H \u25e6 . Hence it\ncontains no conjugates of an element in Hgen , as such an element is contained\nin only finitely many conjugates of hwiH.\n\u0003\n\nWe mention, parenthetically, that the subgroup as in Lemma 11 (2) containing the element x of wH is normalized by C(x). It is definable by descending\nchain condition on definable subgroups, and in particular it contains the definable hull of x as a (possibly smaller) subgroup.\nIn general, an element x of a coset wH has the form x = wh for some h in\nH and taking powers one gets\n(wh)n = wn hw\n\nn\u22121\n\nhw\n\nn\u22122\n\n***h\n\nfor any natural number n (some useful formulas when considering torsion [CJ04,\n\u00a73.3]). Assuming additionally that the element w of N (H) has finite order n\nmodulo H, which can be done in a general way as explained above, one has\n(wh)n = wn hn\nin the easiest case in which w and h commute, with wn in H. This corelation\nbetween the element wh of the coset wH and the n-th power of the element h of\nH will be combined to the full force of the pure genericity argument of Lemma\n11 in our proof of Corollary 2.\nTo this end, our next main step is as follows.\nLemma 12 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank, H a definable connected\ngenerous subgroup, and w an element in N (H) such that hwiH \\ H is not generous in G. Then\nn\u22121\nn\u22122\n{hw hw\n* * * h | h \u2208 H}\nis not generic in H for any multiple n of the (necessarily finite) order of w\nmodulo H.\n14\n\n\fProof. Assume towards a contradiction {hw hw\n* * * h | h \u2208 H} generic in\nH. Let \u03c6 : wh 7\u2192 (wh)n denotes the definable map, from wH to H, consisting\nof taking n-powers. As\nn\u22121\n\n\u03c6(wH) = wn * {hw\n\nn\u22121\n\nhw\n\nn\u22122\n\nn\u22122\n\n* * * h | h \u2208 H},\n\nour contradictory assumption forces that \u03c6(wH) must be generic in H.\nLet Hgen denote the definable generic subset of H provided by Lemma 11\n(2). By connectedness of H, one gets that Hgen \u2229 \u03c6(wH) must be generic in\nH as well. In particular, \u03c6\u22121 (Hgen \u2229 \u03c6(wH)) must be generic in the coset wH,\nand one finds an element x in this preimage and in the subset [wH]gen provided\nby Lemma 11 (1).\nNow \u03c6(x) \u2208 Hgen , but as \u03c6(x) = xn , one gets\nxn \u2208 Hgen \u2229 hxi,\na contradiction to Lemma 11 (2), as hxi is obviously a subgroup of the subgroup\nconsidered in Lemma 11 (2).\n\u0003\nCombined with Theorem 1, one gets the following.\nCorollary 13 Let G be a group of finite Morley rank as in Corollary 9, H a\ndefinable connected generous subgroup of G, and w an element of G\u25e6 in N (H) \\\nH. Then\nn\u22121\nn\u22122\n{hw hw\n* * * h | h \u2208 H}\nis not generic in H for any multiple n of the (necessarily finite) order of w\nmodulo H.\nProof. As usual, H is of finite index in its normalizer by Corollary 5. By\nTheorem 1, or rather its slightly more general form, Corollary 9, Lemma 12\napplies.\n\u0003\nIf w turned out to centralize H in Lemma 12, then one would get\n{hw\n\nn\u22121\n\nhw\n\nn\u22122\n\n* * * h | h \u2208 H} = {hn | h \u2208 H}\n\nand thus Corollary 2 follows similarly from Theorem 1 and Lemma 12. Again,\nCorollary 2 could be stated identically in the slightly more general context of\ngroups as in Corollary 9, taking just care to pick up the element w in G\u25e6 as in\nCorollary 13.\n\u0003\nNot to come to an abrupt end, we mention the following special case of\nCorollary 2, much typical of a connected reductive algebraic group, where the\nmaximal torus corresponds to our abelian generous Carter subgroup. In this\nmere application, we do not conclude much more than the faithfulness of the\naction of the Weyl group, but state it in a form emphasizing various subgroups\nreminiscent of the BN -pair structure of a reductive algebraic group.\n15\n\n\fCorollary 14 Let G be a connected group of finite Morley rank with an abelian\ngenerous Carter subgroup Q, and assume Q p-divisible for any prime p dividing\nthe order of N (Q)/Q. Then Q has (finitely many) proper definable subgroups,\ncorresponding to all subgroups of the form CQ (w) for w varying in N (Q) \\ Q,\nand with a canonical definition as the centers of proper cyclic extensions of Q\nin N (Q). In particular, N (Q)/Q acts faithfully on Q.\nProof. Let w in N (Q) \\ Q, of finite order n modulo Q. As Q is p-divisible for\nall primes p dividing the order of N (Q)/Q, its is n-divisible, and in particular\nQn = Q. Now CQ (w) < Q by Corollary 2. We have shown that CQ (w) < Q for\nany element w in N (Q) \\ Q.\nThe fact that there are finitely many possibilities for such subgroups CQ (w)\nfollows from their alternative definitions as\nCQ (w) = Z(hwiQ)\nand from the fact that N (Q)/Q is finite. For a canonical definition of such\nsubgroups, one may then take Z(hwiQ), with w varying in N (Q) \\ Q.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgments.
