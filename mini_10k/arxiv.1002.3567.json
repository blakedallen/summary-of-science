In this\npaper, a variant of the Hill cipher is introduced that\nmakes the Hill cipher secure while it retains the\nefficiency.

It is\na famous polygram and a classical symmetric cipher\nbased on matrix transformation but it succumbs to the\nknown-plaintext attack [2]. Although its vulnerability to\ncryptanalysis has rendered it unusable in practice, it still\nserves an important pedagogical role in both cryptology\nand linear algebra. The Hill cipher is a block cipher that\nhas several advantages such as disguising letter\nfrequencies of the plaintext, its simplicity because of\nusing matrix multiplication and inversion for encryption\nand decryption, and its high speed and high throughput\n[3].\nSeveral researches have been done to improve the\nsecurity of the Hill cipher. Yeh et al. [4] used two coprime base numbers that are securely shared between the\nparticipants. Although their scheme thwarts the knownplaintext attack, it is so time-consuming, requires many\nmathematical manipulations, and is not efficient\nespecially when dealing with a bulk of data. Saeednia [5]\ntried to make the Hill cipher secure using some random\npermutations of columns and rows of the key matrix but it\nis proved that his cryptosystem is vulnerable to the\nknown-plaintext attack [6], the same vulnerability of the\noriginal Hill cipher. Lin et al. [6] tried to improve the\nsecurity of the Hill cipher using several random numbers\ngenerated in a hash chain but their scheme is not efficient.\nIsmail et al. [3] used an initial vector that multiplies\nsuccessively by some orders of the key matrix to produce\n\n\u2020\n\nAbolfazl Falahati\n\nthe corresponding key of each block but it has several\nsecurity problems [7].\nIn this paper, a secure cryptosystem is introduced that\novercomes all the security drawbacks of the Hill cipher.\nThe proposed scheme includes an encryption algorithm\nthat is a variant of the Affine Hill cipher for which a\nsecure cryptographic protocol is introduced. The\nencryption core of the proposed scheme has the same\nstructure of the Affine Hill cipher but its internal\nmanipulations are different from the previously proposed\ncryptosystems. The rest of this paper is organized as\nfollows. Section 2 briefly introduces the Hill cipher. Our\nproposed scheme is introduced and its computational\ncosts are evaluated in Section 3, and Section 4 concludes\nthe paper.\n\n2. The Hill Cipher\nIn the Hill cipher, the ciphertext is obtained from the\nplaintext by means of a linear transformation. The\nplaintext row vector X is encrypted as Y \uf03d XK (mod m)\nin which Y is the ciphertext row vector, K is an n \uf0b4 n key\nmatrix where k ij \uf0ce \uf05a m in which \uf05a m is ring of integers\nmodulo m where m is a natural number that is greater than\none. The encryption procedure proceeds by encoding the\nresulted ciphertext row vector into alphabets of the main\nplaintext. The value of the modulus m in the original Hill\ncipher was 26 but its value can be optionally selected.\nThe key matrix K is supposed to be securely shared\nbetween the participants. The ciphertext Y is decrypted as\nX \uf03d YK \uf02d1 (mod m) . All operations are performed over\n\uf05am .\nFor decryption to be possible, the key matrix K should\nbe invertible or equivalently, it should satisfy\ngcd (det K (mod m), m) \uf03d 1 [2]. However, many of square\nmatrices are not invertible over \uf05a m . The risk of\ndeterminant having common factors with the modulus can\nbe reduced by taking a prime number as the modulus.\nSuch selection also increases the keyspace of the\ncryptosystem [8].\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 IEEE.

When n\nis unknown and the modulus m is not too large, the\nopponent could simply try successive values of n until he\nfounds the key. If the guessed value of n was incorrect,\nthe obtained key matrix would be disagreed with further\nplaintext-ciphertext pairs. The most important security\nflaw of the Hill cipher is regarded to its vulnerability to\nthe known-plaintext attack. It can be broken by taking\njust n distinct pairs of plaintext and ciphertext [2]. In this\nkind of attack, the cryptanalyst possesses the plaintext of\nsome messages and the corresponding ciphertext of those\nmessages. He will try to deduce the key or an algorithm to\ndecrypt any new messages encrypted with the same key.\nThe Affine Hill cipher extends the concept of Hill\ncipher by mixing it with a nonlinear affine transformation\n[2] so the encryption expression will have the form of\nY \uf03d XK \uf02b V (mod m) . In this paper, we extend such\nconcept to introduce a secure variant of the Hill cipher.\n\n3. The Proposed Scheme\nThe proposed cryptosystem includes a ciphering core that\nis depicted in Figure 1, and a one-pass protocol which is\nshown in Figure 2. The encryption core has the same\nstructure of the Affine Hill cipher but in order to give\nmore randomization to the introduced scheme and to\nstrengthen it against the common attacks, each block of\ndata is encrypted using a random number. For avoiding\nmultiple random number generations, only one random\nnumber is generated at the beginning of encryption and\nthe corresponding random number of the following data\nblocks is recursively generated using a one-way hash\nfunction in a hash chain, as it is depicted in Figure 1. The\nbasic random number that is generated prior to the\nencryption should be securely shared between the\nparticipants. This can be done using the introduced onepass protocol that is depicted in Figure 2 where the\nencryption and decryption procedures should be followed\nfrom Figure 1. The steps will be:\n1. Alice secretly selects random integers a0 and b\nwhere 0 \uf03c a0 \uf03c p \uf02d 1 and 1 \uf03c b \uf03c n 2 in which n is\nthe rank of the key matrix. She computes\nr \uf03d a0 kij (mod p)\nwhere\ni \uf03d \uf0e9b n \uf0f9\nand\nj \uf03d b \uf02d n(i \uf02d 1) in which \uf0e9\uf0f9\n. denotes the ceiling.\nShe encodes the plaintext\nmessage\ninto\nsome\nrow\nvectors X \uf03d [ x1 x2 ... xn ] . For\nthe tth block of data to be encrypted ( t \uf03d 1,2,... ), she\ncomputes at with a recursive expression as\n\nFigure 1. Ciphering core of the proposed scheme\n\nFigure 2. A protocol for the proposed scheme\nat \uf03d H (at \uf02d1 ) in which H(.) denotes the one-way\n\nhash function. If at is invertible mod p, i.e.\nat \uf0ba\uf02f 0(mod p) ,\nshe\nputs\nv0 \uf03d at (mod p) .\nOtherwise, she puts v0 \uf03d 1 . She produces the\nrow vector V \uf03d [v1 v2 ... vn ] with the\nrecursive expression as vi \uf03d kij \uf02b v~i \uf02d1at (mod p) for\ni \uf03d 1,..., n and j \uf03d (v mod n) \uf02b 1 , in which v~ is\ni \uf02d1\n\ni \uf02d1\n\ndefined as v~i \uf02d1 \uf03d 2 \uf0e9\uf067 / 2 \uf0f9 \uf02b (vi \uf02d1 mod 2 \uf0e9\uf067 / 2 \uf0f9 )\n\nwhere\n\uf067 \uf03d \uf0eblog 2 vi \uf02d1 \uf0fb \uf02b 1 denotes the bit-length of vi \uf02d1\nand \uf0eb\uf0fb\n. indicates the floor. She then encrypts all the\nplaintext vectors as Y \uf03d v0 XK \uf02b V (mod p) . She\nrepeats the procedure until all blocks of plaintext\nbecome encrypted.\n\n2. Bob\n\ncomputes\n\n\uf02d1\n\nu \uf03d kij (mod p )\n\nand\n\na0 \uf03d ru (mod p)\nin which\ni \uf03d \uf0e9b n \uf0f9\nand\nj \uf03d b \uf02d n(i \uf02d 1) . He uses a0 for decrypting the\n\nciphertext as X \uf03d v0\uf02d1 (Y \uf02d V )K \uf02d1 (mod p ) , as it is\ndepicted in Figure 1.\nThe introduced protocol is a one-pass protocol that is\ndesigned for the proposed cryptosystem. As a one-pass\nprotocol, it does not have any explicit authentication step\nbut it is secure, and does not reveal any secret\ninformation. It is so suitable for situations where both of\nparticipants are not online.\n\n\fThe introduced expression for generating the elements\nof vector V as vi \uf03d kij \uf02b v~i \uf02d1at (mod p) and defining v~i \uf02d1 as\nv~i \uf02d1 \uf03d 2 \uf0e9\uf067 / 2 \uf0f9 \uf02b (vi \uf02d1 mod 2 \uf0e9\uf067 / 2 \uf0f9 ) takes advantages of ideas\nbehind the MQV key-exchange protocols [9]. v~ is\ni \uf02d1\n\nsimply computed by taking the least significant half in\nbinary representation of vi \uf02d1 and such definition will\ndecrease the computational costs and consequently,\nincreases the efficiency [9].\nThe proposed cryptosystem neutralizes all the security\ndrawbacks of the Hill cipher. It thwarts the knownplaintext attack since n equations cannot be used for\nsolving an unknown n \uf0b4 n matrix and 2n unknown\nparameters. Choosing a large prime number p as the\nmodulus extremely enhances the keyspace so the bruteforce or equivalently, the ciphertext-only attack does not\nhave any benefit for the attacker. The random number\nafter a secure transmission is recursively encoded with the\none-way hash function so it differs for each block of\nplaintext. The chosen-ciphertext and chosen-plaintext\nattacks are also thwarted since the random number a0\nthat its knowledge is essential for such attacks, is\nexchanged through a secure protocol.\n\n3.1. Computational Costs\nLet TEnc and TDec denote the running time for encryption\nand decryption of each block of data respectively. By\nneglecting the computational costs of the introduced\nprotocol and the required computations of computing the\ninverse key matrix that is used for decryption, we have:\nTEnc ~\n\uf03d (n 2 \uf02b 2n)TMul \uf02b (n 2 \uf02b n \uf02b 1)TAdd \uf02b THash\n\n(1)\n\nTDec ~\n\uf03d (n 2 \uf02b 2n)TMul \uf02b (n 2 \uf02b n \uf02b 1)TAdd \uf02b THash \uf02b TInv\n\n(2)\n\nin which THash is the running time for the hash\ncalculations, and TMul , TAdd and TInv are the time needed\nfor the scalar modular multiplication, addition, and\ninverse calculations respectively. Total required number\nof operations for computing SHA-1 and MD5 hash\nfunctions are calculated as 1110 and 744 operations\nrespectively [10]. Each of TMul , TAdd and TInv requires\ndifferent number of operations. Let \uf07a \uf03d \uf0eblog 2 p \uf0fb \uf02b 1\ndenotes the bit-length of modulus p. Using the\nconventional methods, the running time for calculating a\nmodular addition, modular multiplication, and modular\ninverse will be of [11]:\nTAdd \uf03d O(\uf07a )\n\n(3)\n\nTMul \uf03d O(\uf07a 2 )\n\n(4)\n\nTInv \uf03d O(\uf07a 3 )\n\n(5)\n\nThere are also many fast algorithms for the\ncomputations [12] but we consider the time complexity of\nconventional methods since it corresponds with the worst\nsituation and anyone can decrease the required number of\noperations by deploying faster algorithms. The\ncomputational complexity of the proposed scheme for\nencrypting and decrypting each block of data can be\nsimply estimated by substituting expressions (3-5) into\n(1) and (2). The running time for encryption and\ndecryption of each block of data explicitly depends on\n\uf07a (the bit-length of modulus p) and n (the rank of the key\nmatrix). The size of modulus p depends on the number of\ndeployed alphabets in the plaintext.\nLet L denotes the number of letters in the plaintext.\nTotal processing time for enciphering the whole blocks of\nplaintext is:\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf0e9L\uf0f9\nTTotal _ Enc ~\n\uf03d \uf0ea \uf0fa ( n 2 \uf02b 2 n )TMul \uf02b ( n 2 \uf02b n \uf02b 1)TAdd \uf02b THash\n\uf0ean\uf0fa\n(6)\n\nwhile the running time for decrypting the whole\nciphertext is:\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf0e9L\uf0f9\nTTotal _ Dec ~\n\uf03d \uf0ea \uf0fa ( n 2 \uf02b 2 n )TMul \uf02b ( n 2 \uf02b n \uf02b 1)T Add \uf02b THash \uf02b TInv\n\uf0ean\uf0fa\n\n\uf029\n\n(7)\nThe computational costs of the proposed scheme for\nencryption/decryption of all blocks of data can be simply\ncalculated by substituting expressions (3-5) into (6) and\n(7). Figure 3 depicts the effects of rank value of the key\nmatrix on the total number of operations for encipherment\n/decipherment of the whole plaintext/ciphertext that is\nobtained using (6) and (7) for L \uf03d 1000 and p \uf03d 257 .\nThe size effects of the modulus p on the total number of\noperations for encipherment/decipherment of the whole\nplaintext/ciphertext is also depicted in Figure 4 that is\nobtained using (6) and (7) for L \uf03d 1000 and n \uf03d 4 . It is\nnoteworthy that the waves in Figure 3 are according to\nthe introduced ceiling function in (6) and (7) while the\nsteps in Figure 4 are due to logarithmic relationship\nbetween the modulus p and its bit-length \uf07a . Table 1\ngives a comparison between the required number of\noperations for encrypting/decrypting each block of data in\nthe proposed scheme and those of the other schemes. It\nshows that the computational cost of the proposed scheme\nis slightly more than that of the Affine Hill cipher so it is\ncomputationally efficient while it thwarts the security\nvulnerabilities of the Hill cipher.\n\n\f4. Conclusions\nIn this paper, a symmetric cryptosystem is introduced that\nis actually a secure variant of the Affine Hill cipher. It\nincludes a ciphering core for which a one-pass\ncryptographic protocol is introduced. The outer structure\nof the ciphering core is similar to the Affine Hill cipher\nbut its inner manipulations are different. Each block of\ndata is encrypted using a different random number that is\ngenerated using a chained hash function. The proposed\ncryptosystem thwarts the known-plaintext, chosenciphertext, and chosen-plaintext attacks. Since the\nmodulus is a prime number, the keyspace is greatly\nincreased and the ciphertext-only attack is also thwarted.\nFigure 3.
