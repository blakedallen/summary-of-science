Introduction\nLet X be a projective scheme over an algebraically closed field. Given a vector bundle E on X, we can\nconsider various notions of positivity for E , such as ample, nef and big. As a particular example, consider\na smooth projective variety X and its cotangent bundle \u03a9X . When \u03a9X is ample, X has some very nice\nproperties. For example, all subvarieties of X are of general type and X is algebraically hyperbolic, so in\nparticular, X does not contain rational or elliptic curves, there do not exist non-constant maps f : A \u2192 X,\nwhere A is an abelian variety, and X is Kobayashi hyperbolic, [3]. Requiring that the cotangent bundle be\nample is certainly a very strong property, and for a long time there were very few examples of such varieties,\nalthough they were expected to be reasonably abundant. One such example was constructed by Michael\nSchneider.\nTheorem 1.1. [17] Let f : X \u2192 Y be a smooth projective nonisotrivial morphism, where X and Y are\nsmooth projective varieties over C, of dimensions 2 and 1, respectively. Suppose for all y \u2208 Y , the KodairaSpencer map \u03c1f,y : TY,y \u2192 H 1 (Xy , TXy ) is non-zero, then \u03a9X is ample.\nNote that certain Kodaira surfaces satisfy the condition above. In this paper, we generalize Theorem 1.1\nto varieties of higher dimensions. To do so, we will introduce a slightly weaker notion of ampleness, which we\nwill call \"quasi-ample\" and \"quasi-ample with respect to an open subset U \" (see Definitions 1.9 and 1.13).\nUsing this notion we extend Schneider's result to varieties of higher dimension.\nTheorem 1.2. Let\nXn\n\nfn\n\n/ X n\u22121\n\nfn\u22121\n\n/ X n\u22122\n\nfn\u22122\n\n/ ******\n\nf3\n\n/ X2\n\nf2\n\n/ X1\n\nwhere each X i is a smooth projective variety over C of dimension i, and each fi : X i \u2192 X i\u22121 is a smooth,\nprojective morphism with Var(fi ) = i \u2212 1. Then, \u03a9X n is nef and quasi-ample with respect to an open Un\n(precisely defined below in Theorem 2.11) and OP(\u03a9X n ) (1) is a big line bundle on P(\u03a9X n ).\nWe also extend this result to towers of varieties\nXn\n\nfn\n\n/ X n\u22121\n\nfn\u22121\n\n/ X n\u22122\n\nfn\u22122\n\n/ ******\n\nf3\n\n/ X2\n\nf2\n\n/ X1\n\nwhere the fi are not necessarily smooth (Theorem 2.16), and show that \u03a91X n (log D) is quasi-ample with\nrespect to an open set, where D is a suitable divisor taking in account the singularities of the given morphisms.\nIn Section 3 we construct a tower of varieties satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.12 using a construction\ndue to Kodaira which for any n produces a g for which Mg contains a complete n-dimensional subvariety.\nAcknowledgments.

Recall that a vector bundle E on a proper scheme X is ample if for\nevery coherent sheaf F , there is an integer m0 > 0, such that for every m \u2265 m0 , the sheaf F \u2297 Symm E is\ngenerated as an OX -module by its global sections. Equivalently, E is ample if the tautological line bundle\nOP(E ) (1) on P(E ) is ample.\nDate: November 3, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 14J10.\n1\n\n\fA vector bundle E on a proper scheme X is nef (or semipositive) if for every complete nonsingular curve\nC and map \u03b3 : C \u2192 X, every quotient bundle Q of \u03b3 \u2217 E has degree at least zero. Equivalently, E is nef if\nthe tautological line bundle OP(E ) (1) on P(E ) is nef.\nAmple, respectively nef, vector bundles, have many nice properties. For example, quotients of ample\n(respectively nef) vector bundles are ample (respectively nef) and extensions of ample (respectively nef)\nvector bundles are ample (respectively nef). For more properties see [8] or [15, Sec 6.1A and 6.1B].\nLet E be a vector bundle of rank r on an irreducible projective variety X of dimension n. Following the\nwork of Fulton and Lazarsfeld [5] we can introduce a type of numerical positivity. More precisely, starting\nwith a weighted homogeneous polynomial P \u2208 Q[c1 , . . . , cr ], we get a Chern number\nZ\nZ\nP (c(E )) :=\nP (c1 (E ), . . . , cr (E )).\nX\n\nX\n\nDefinition 1.3. Let \u039b(n, r) be the set of all partitions of n by non-negative integers less than or equal to r.\nThen for every \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) \u2208 \u039b(n, r) we can form the Schur polynomial, s\u03bb \u2208 Q[c1 , . . . , cr ], of weighted\ndegree n, which is the determinant of the n \u00d7 n matrix:\nc\u03bb1\nc\u03bb2 \u22121\n..\n.\n\nc\u03bb1 +1\nc\u03bb2\n..\n.\n\n. . . c\u03bb1 +n\u22121\n. . . c\u03bb2 +n\u22122\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\nc\u03bbn \u2212n\n\nc\u03bbn \u2212n+1\n\n...\n\nc\u03bbn\n\nwhere c0 = 1 and ci = 0 if i \u2208\n/ [0, r].\nIn Rparticular, if P is a positive linear combination of Schur polynomials and E is ample (respectively nef),\nthen X P (c(E )) > 0 (respectively \u2265).\nWe next generalize the notion of big for vector bundles. Recall that a divisor D is big if there exists\na c > 0, such that h0 (X, OX (mD)) > cmn for m \u226b 1. Generalizing this notion to vector bundles is not\nconsistent in the literature. As a first definition, we generalize the notion as we did with ample and nef.\nThis is the definition given for example in [15] and [2].\nDefinition 1.4. [15, 6.1.23] . Let E be a vector bundle on X, then E is L-big if OP(E ) (1) is a big line bundle\non P(E ). (Here, L-big is used instead of big to avoid confusion with the second definition given below.)\nExample 1.5. As an example, consider the rank 2 vector bundle E = OP1 \u2295 OP1 (1) on P1 . Since a direct\nsum of line bundles is L-big if and only if some N\u2212linear combination of the direct summands is a big line\nbundle [15, 2.3.2(iv)], we see that E is L-big. Note in this example E is L-big but it has a quotient OP1 ,\nwhich is not big.\nIt is also useful to see that OP(E ) (1) is big in a slightly different way (which we will refer to in Example\n1.7). First note that P(E ) \u2243 P(E \u2032 ) where E \u2032 := E \u2297 OP1 (\u22121) \u2243 OP1 \u2295 OP1 (\u22121). Fix a section C0 of\nX = P(E \u2032 ) with OX (C0 ) \u2243 OP(E \u2032 ) (1), and let f be a fiber. Then OP(E ) (1) corresponds to a section C1 , which\nis linearly equivalent to C0 + f . Given A = aC0 + bf ample, then a > 0 and b > a [10, V.2.18], so that\nbC1 \u2212 A = (b \u2212 a)C0 is effective, and hence OP(E ) (1) is big.\nWe next turn to a different generalization of big to vector bundles introduced by Viehweg. To do so, we\nfirst need a generalization of nef.\nDefinition 1.6. [19] Let E be vector bundle on a projective variety X and let H be an ample line bundle.\n(1) E is weakly positive over an open U if for every a > 0, there exists b > 0 such that Symab (E ) \u2297 H b\nis globally generated over U , that is H 0 (X, Symab (E ) \u2297 H b ) \u2297 OX \u2192 Symab (E ) \u2297 H b is surjective\nover U .\n(2) E is V-big (or ample with respect to U ) if there exists an open dense U in X and c > 0 such that\nSymc E \u2297 H \u22121 is weakly positive over U .\nEquivalently, a vector bundle E is ample with respect to U if and only if the tautological bundle OP(E ) (1)\nis ample with respect to \u03c0 \u22121 (U ) (where \u03c0 : P(E ) \u2192 X), [21, 3.4]. At first glance it seems that these two\ngeneralizations of big to vector bundles may be equivalent, however the second notion of big, V-big, is strictly\nstronger than L-big.\n2\n\n\fExample 1.7. Consider the above Example 1.5, where we view OP(E ) (1) as C1 = C0 + f . Then C1 is\nample with respect to V = X \u2212 C0 . But \u03c0(V ) = P1 , so there is no open U \u2282 P1 with \u03c0 \u22121 (U ) = V . Thus\nE = OP1 \u2295 OP1 (1) is L-big but not V-big.\nIn general, we have that if E \u2192 Q is surjective over an open set U and E is ample with respect to U , then\nQ is also ample with respect to U [21, 3.30]. As noted in Example 1.5, L-big does not have this property, so\nthis again shows that the V-big is stronger than L-big.\nExample 1.8. As a second example, let C be a curve of genus greater than one and let X = C \u00d7 C, with\nprojections p1 and p2 . In this case, the cotangent bundle \u03a9X is L-big, that is O P(\u03a9X ) (1) is a big line bundle\non P(\u03a9X ), but since \u03a9X surjects onto p\u22171 \u03c9C , we see that \u03a9X is not V-big. Similarly, we can see that the two\ndefinitions of big are not equivalent for the tangent bundle. Consider the smooth quadric surface Q, then\nTQ is L-big, but TQ surjects onto p\u22171 \u03c9P\u22121\n1 , so it is not V-big.\nIn view of these different definitions we will avoid saying that a vector bundle E on X is \"big\" and instead\nsay that either OP(E ) (1) is a big line bundle or E is ample with respect to some open set U .\nWe next define a new notion of positivity that is slightly weaker than ample, but stronger than nef.\nDefinition 1.9. A vector bundle E on X is quasi-ample if for every non-constant morphism \u03b3 : C \u2192 X\nfrom a complete nonsingular curve C, \u03b3 \u2217 E is ample on C.\nIn the case where E is a line bundle, the terminology strictly nef has been used [18]. Many properties of\nample vector bundles carry over to quasi-ample vector bundles. For example,\nTheorem 1.10. [11, 4.3] Let E and E \u2032 be a vector bundles on X\n(1) If E is quasi-ample then any quotient of E is quasi-ample.\n(2) If Symm E is quasi-ample for some m, then E is quasi-ample.\n(3) If E is quasi-ample, then Symm E and E m are quasi-ample for every m > 0, and \u039bm E is quasi-ample\nfor m = 1, 2, . . . , r, where r is the rank of E .\n(4) If E and E \u2032 are quasi-ample, then E \u2297 E \u2032 is quasi-ample.\n(5) Let\n0 \u2192 E \u2032 \u2192 E \u2192 E \u2032\u2032 \u2192 0\nbe an exact sequence of vector bundles on X. If E \u2032 and E \u2032\u2032 are quasi-ample, then E is quasi-ample.\n(6) Let E be quasi-ample, and let Y be a subscheme of X. Then E |Y is quasi-ample on Y .\nProof. We give the proof of (1); the others follow similarly. Let E be a quasi-ample vector bundle on X and\nQ a quotient of E . If \u03b3 : C \u2192 X is any non-constant morphism from a complete non-singular curve, then\n\u03b3 \u2217 E is an ample vector bundle with quotient \u03b3 \u2217 Q, so \u03b3 \u2217 Q is also ample. Hence Q is quasi-ample.\n\u0003\nWe also have the following criteria for when a quasi-ample bundle is ample, originally due to Gieseker, see\n[15, 6.1.7], for Gieseker's original statement and proof or [11, 4.7].\nTheorem 1.11. Let E be a vector bundle on X, where X is proper over a field k. Then E is ample if and\nonly if the two following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) There exists an m0 > 0 such that Symm E is generated by global sections for all m \u2265 m0 , and\n(2) E is quasi-ample.\nCorollary 1.12. Let X be a complex projective variety with at most canonical singularities. If \u03c9X is quasiample and big, then \u03c9X is ample.\nProof. Let KX be a canonical divisor corresponding to \u03c9X . Since KX is quasi-ample, it is nef. Thus\n2KX \u2212 KX = KX is nef and big, so by the Base Point Free Theorem, [13, 3.3], |bKX | has no base points for\nb\nis generated by global sections, so by (1.11) \u03c9X is ample.\n\u0003\nb \u226b 0. Thus \u03c9X\nIn general, quasi-ample does not imply ample. Mumford constructs an example of a quasi-ample vector\nbundle that is not ample, see [9, Example 10.6]. Namely, he starts with a curve of genus greater than two\nand a rank two vector bundle E of degree zero such that Symm (E ) is stable for all m \u2265 0. Then OP(E ) (1)\nis a quasi-ample line bundle that is not big, hence can not be ample. Ramanujam extends this example to\nproduce a quasi-ample and big line bundle which is not ample, see [9, Example 10.8].\n3\n\n\fHowever, in certain cases quasi-ample implies ample. For example, it is not difficult to see that for the\ntangent bundle of a projective variety, TX being quasi-ample implies that TX is ample, and hence X \u2243 Pn .\nIn the case of the cotangent bundle, it is unknown if \u03a9X being quasi-ample implies that \u03a9X is ample. It\nalso is unknown whether \u03a9X quasi-ample with OP(\u03a9X ) (1) big implies that \u03a9X is ample with respect to an\nopen set (note in Example 1.8 where, X = C \u00d7 C, \u03a9X is not quasi-ample).\nWe can weaken the condition of quasi-ample as follows\nDefinition 1.13. If U \u2286 X is an open set, E quasi-ample with respect to U if for every non-constant\nmorphism \u03b3 : C \u2192 X from a complete nonsingular curve C, where \u03b3(C) \u2229 U 6= \u2205, \u03b3 \u2217 E is ample on C.\nWe end this section by recalling the notions of isotriviality and maximum variation.\nDefinition 1.14. A morphism X \u2192 S, where S is a complete nonsingular curve, is isotrivial if Xs \u2243 Xt ,\nfor general s, t \u2208 S.\nNote that if X \u2192 S is smooth projective isotrivial morphism then there exists an \u00e9tale cover S \u2032 \u2192 S such\nthat X \u00d7S S \u2032 \u2192 S \u2032 is trivial. If f : X \u2192 S is nonisotrivial, then for general t \u2208 S, the Kodaira-Spencer map\nat t, \u03c1f,t : TS,t \u2192 H 1 (Xt , TXt ), is nonzero.\nMore generally, let f : X \u2192 Y be a surjective morphism between smooth projective varieties, then\nVar(f ) denotes the number of effective parameters of the birational equivalence classes of the fibers. For\nthe rigorous definition of Var(f ), see [12, 2.8] or [19, pg. 329]. If Var(f ) = 0 then Xy \u2243 Xt for general\ny, t \u2208 Y . If Var(f ) = dim Y , we say that f has maximum variation. If f is smooth and if for all y \u2208 Y the\nset {p \u2208 Y |Xp \u2243 Xy } is finite, then Var(f ) = dim Y . Conversely, if f is smooth and Var(f ) = dim Y , then\nthere exists a moduli space for the fibers of f , and hence there exists an open set U \u2286 Y such that for all\ny \u2208 U , the set {p \u2208 U |Xp \u2243 Xy } is finite. In the case where a moduli space exists for the fibers of f , the\nvariation of f is equal to the rank of the Kodaira-Spencer map at a general point of Y , so in particular, if\nVar(f ) = dim Y , then the Kodaira-Spencer map at a general point of Y is injective.\n2. Positivity of Cotangent Bundles\nIf X is a complex smooth projective variety, we can consider the case where the cotangent bundle \u03a9X is\nample. In this case, X is both algebraically and Kobayashi hyperbolic [3], so in particular, X contains no\nrational or elliptic curves and any map from an abelian variety to X is constant. If we consider the weaker\ncase of \u03a9X being only quasi-ample, X still has some nice properties.\nLemma 2.1. Let X be a smooth projective variety with quasi-ample cotangent bundle \u03a9X . Then\n(1) If Y \u2282 X is a nonsingular subvariety, then Y has a quasi-ample cotangent bundle \u03a9Y .\n(2) If f : Y \u2192 X is any morphism where Y is an abelian variety or P1 , then f is constant.\nProof. Let i : Y \u0592\u2192 X, where X has a quasi-ample cotangent bundle. If I denotes the ideal sheaf of Y ,\nthen we have the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 I /I 2 \u2192 \u03a9X |Y \u2192 \u03a9Y \u2192 0.\nSince \u03a9X is quasi-ample, \u03a9X |Y is quasi-ample and hence so is \u03a9Y .\nSuppose f : Y \u2192 X is a non-constant morphism from an abelian variety Y to a smooth projective variety\nX, with \u03a9X quasi-ample. Let C be a complete nonsingular curve and let \u03b3 : C \u2192 Y be a non-constant\nmorphism such that f \u03b3 : C \u2192 X is also non-constant. Then we get the following commutative diagram\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03a9X\n\n/ \u03a9C\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\u03b2\u2032\n/ \u03a9C\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y\n\u2032\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u2217\nwith \u03b2 and \u03b2 nonzero. Hence \u03b1 : \u03b3 f \u03a9X \u2192 \u03b3 \u03a9Y must also be nonzero. Since \u03a9X is quasi-ample,\nHom(\u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03a9X , OC ) = 0, and since Y is an abelian variety, \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y \u2243 OC\u2295d , where d is the dimension of Y .\nThus Hom(\u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03a9X , \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9Y ) = 0 forcing \u03b1 to be zero, which is a contradiction, so f : Y \u2192 X must be\nconstant. If f : P1 \u2192 X is non-constant, then we get a non-constant map \u03c3 : f \u2217 \u03a9X \u2192 \u03a9P1 . Let E be the\nimage of \u03c3, then E is ample since it is a quotient of f \u2217 \u03a9X . But then, since TP1 surjects onto E \u2228 , E \u2228 is also\nample, which leads to a contradiction. Thus any f : P1 \u2192 X must be constant.\n\u0003\n4\n\n\fWe now begin our generalization of Theorem 1.1.\n2.1. Smooth Towers of Smooth Projective Varieties.\nTheorem 2.2. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a smooth projective morphism, where dim X = dim Y + 1 and Var(f ) =\ndim Y . Then, for all y \u2208 Y , Xy is a curve of genus at least 2, and if dim Y = 1, the genus of Y is also at\nleast 2. In particular \u03c9Xy is an ample line bundle on Xy for all y \u2208 Y .\nProof. Suppose first dim Y = 1, so dim X = 2. Then, by [1, III.15.4], g(Y ) \u2265 2. Since f is flat, the genus of\nthe fibers is constant. If the genus is zero, then all the fibers are isomorphic to P1 , hence f is isotrivial. By\nthe existence of the J-fibration, the genus of the fibers can not be one [1, Ch V, Sections 9 and 14]. Thus\nthe genus of the fibers is at least 2. If dim Y = n, for n > 1, let S be a general curve in Y . Restricting f to\nf \u22121 (S), we are in the previous case, so Xy must have genus at least 2.\n\u0003\nGiven a surjective map of smooth projective varieties, f : X \u2192 Y , of relative dimension k, we will use\nm\nthe positivity of f\u2217 \u03c9X/Y\nand, more generally, f\u2217 \u03a9kX/Y (log \u2206)m , where \u2206 is a normal crossing divisor on X.\nThese deep results are found in the work of Viehweg and Koll\u00e1r (cf. [20], [12]). In particular, we will use\nthe following formulation\nTheorem 2.3. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a surjective map of smooth projective varieties of relative dimension k,\nwith Var(f ) = dim Y .\nm\n(1) [24, 3.4] If f : X \u2192 Y is smooth and \u03c9X/Y is f -ample, then f\u2217 \u03c9X/Y\nis ample with respect to an\nm\nopen dense V \u2282 Y for all m > 1, where f\u2217 \u03c9X/Y 6= 0. Furthermore, we can take V to be the open set\nwhere the moduli map \u03b7 : V \u2192 Mh is quasi-finite over it's image.\n(2) [24, 3.6] Let S \u2282 Y be a reduced normal crossing divisor containing the discriminant locus and let\n\u2206 := f \u2217 S be a normal crossing divisor. Let V := Y \u2212 S and U := X \u2212 \u2206, so we have a smooth\nfamily U \u2192 V . Suppose that \u03c9U/V is f \u2212semi-ample, the smooth fibers of f are canonically polarized\nand that the moduli map \u03b7 : V \u2192 Mh is quasi-finite over it's image. Then for m sufficiently large\nand divisible, f\u2217 \u03a9kX/Y (log \u2206)m is ample with respect to V .\nTheorem 2.4. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a surjective nonisotrivial morphism of smooth projective varieties, with\ndim Y = 1 and \u03c9Xy an ample line bundle for all y \u2208 Y . Then \u03c9X/Y is an ample line bundle.\nm\nis ample for some m > 0, [20],\nProof. The proof follows exactly as in [14, 2.5], once we know that f\u2217 \u03c9X/Y\n[12].\n\u0003\n\nThe following is due to Gieseker\nLemma 2.5. [6, Proposition 2.2] Let C be a nonsingular curve and suppose F is ample on C and we have\na non-trivial extension\n0 \u2192 OC \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 0.\nThen E is ample.\nWe first consider Schneider's original set-up, that is a nonisotrivial smooth projective morphism from a\nsurface to a curve.\nLemma 2.6. Let X and Y be smooth projective varieties, with dim Y = 1, and let f : X \u2192 Y be a smooth\nprojective nonisotrivial morphism. Let B := {p \u2208 Y |\u03b1 : H 0 (Xp , f \u2217 TY |Xp ) \u2192 H 1 (Xp , TXp ) is not injective}.\nThen for any y \u2208 Y \u2212 B, the short exact sequence,\n0 \u2192 f \u2217 \u03a9Y |Xy \u2192 \u03a9X |Xy \u2192 \u03a9X/Y |Xy \u2192 0\n\n(1)\ndoes not split.\n\nProof. Let y \u2208 Y \u2212 B, then \u03b1 : H 0 (Xp , f \u2217 TY |Xp ) \u2192 H 1 (Xp , TXp ) is injective. To show that (1) does not\nsplit, it suffices to show that\n(2)\n\n0 \u2192 TXy \u2192 TX |Xy \u2192 f \u2217 TY |Xy \u2192 0\n\ndoes not split. Taking cohomology, we get\n* * * \u2192 H 0 (Xy , TX |Xy ) \u2192 H 0 (Xy , f \u2217 TY |Xy ) \u2192 H 1 (Xy , TXy ) \u2192 H 1 (Xy , TX |Xy ) \u2192 * * *\n5\n\n\fIf (2) splits, then H 0 (Xy , TX |Xy ) \u2192 H 0 (Xy , f \u2217 TY |Xy ) is surjective, and so the image of \u03b1 : H 0 (Xy , f \u2217 TY |Xy ) \u2192\nH 1 (Xy , TXy ) is zero. Thus im(\u03b1) = ker(\u03b1) = 0, so H 0 (Xy , f \u2217 TY |Xy ) = 0, a contradiction. Therefore (1)\nmust not split.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.7. Let X and Y be smooth projective varieties over C of dimensions 2 and 1, respectively,\nand let f : X \u2192 Y be a smooth projective nonisotrivial morphism. Suppose \u03b3 : C \u2192 X is a non-constant\nmorphism from a complete nonsingular curve, with \u03b3(C) contained in a fiber of f , say Xy . Moreover, suppose\n\u03b1 : H 0 (Xy , f \u2217 TY |Xy ) \u2192 H 1 (Xy , TXy ) is injective. Then \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9X is an ample vector bundle on C.\nProof. Suppose \u03b3(C) \u2286 Xy , for some y \u2208 Y . Since \u03b3 : C \u2192 Xy is finite and the pull-back of an ample line\nbundle by a finite map is ample, it suffices to show that \u03a9X |Xy is ample. By (2.6)\n0 \u2192 f \u2217 \u03a9Y |Xy \u2192 \u03a9X |Xy \u2192 \u03a9X/Y |Xy \u2192 0\ndoes not split. Since f \u2217 \u03a9Y |Xy \u2243 OXy and \u03a9X/Y |Xy \u2243 \u03c9Xy is ample by (2.2), \u03a9X |Xy is ample by (2.5).\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 2.8. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a smooth, projective, nonisotrivial morphism, with X and Y projective\nvarieties over C, of dimensions 2 and 1, respectively. Let B := {p \u2208 Y |\u03b1 : H 0 (Xp , f \u2217 TY |Xp ) \u2192 H 1 (Xp , TXp )\nis not injective}. Then, \u03a9X is quasi-ample\nwith respect to U := f \u22121 (Y \u2212 B) and for all \u03bb \u2208 \u039b(2, 2), the\nR\nSchur polynomial is positive, that is X s\u03bb (\u03a9X ) > 0. In particular, OP(\u03a9X ) (1) is big.\n\nProof. We will first show that \u03a9X is quasi-ample with respect to U . Let \u03b3 : C \u2192 X be a non-constant\nmorphism from a complete nonsingular curve C, such that \u03b3(C) \u2229 U 6= \u2205. If \u03b3(C) is in a fiber of f , then by\n(2.7), \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9X is ample.\nNow suppose \u03b3(C) is not in a fiber of f , so f \u25e6 \u03b3 : C \u2192 Y is non-constant. We have the following short\nexact sequence:\n0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03c9Y \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9X \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c9X/Y \u2192 0.\nSince \u03c9Y is ample, \u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03c9Y is ample on C. By (2.4), \u03c9X/Y is ample on X, hence \u03b3 \u2217 \u03c9X/Y is ample on C.\nThus, \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9X is ample. Therefore, \u03a9X is quasi-ample with respect to U . Note also that \u03a9X is an extension\nof two nef line bundles, namely f \u2217 \u03c9Y and \u03c9X/Y , so \u03a9X is nef.\nWe now will show that the Schur polynomials are positive. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u039b(2, 2), then \u03bb = (1, 1) or \u03bb = (2, 0),\nand by definition,\ns(1,1) (\u03a9X ) = c1 (\u03a9X )2 \u2212 c2 (\u03a9X ) and s(2,0) (\u03a9X ) = c2 (\u03a9X ).\nUsing the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 f \u2217 \u03c9Y \u2192 \u03a9X \u2192 \u03c9X/Y \u2192 0,\nwe see that,\nc1 (\u03a9X ) = c1 (f \u2217 \u03c9Y ) + c1 (\u03c9X/Y ) and c2 (\u03a9X ) = c1 (f \u2217 \u03c9Y ) * c1 (\u03c9X/Y ).\nThus,\ns(1,1) (\u03a9X ) = c1 (\u03a9X )2 \u2212 c2 (\u03a9X ) = c1 (f \u2217 \u03c9Y ) * c1 (\u03c9X/Y ) + c1 (\u03c9X/Y )2\nand\ns(2,0) (\u03a9X ) = c1 (f \u2217 \u03c9Y ) * c1 (\u03c9X/Y ).\nP\nP\nSince \u03c9Y is ample,\nc1 (\u03c9Y ) =\nmi [yi ], where yi \u2208 X are points and\nmi > 0. Since f is flat, c1 (f \u2217 \u03c9Y ) =\nP\nf \u2217 c1 (\u03c9Y ) =\nni [Xyi ]. Now, \u03c9X/Y |Xy = \u03c9Xy is ample for all y \u2208 Y and deg(\u03c9Xy ) = 2g(Xy ) \u2212 2 \u2265 2 is\nconstant for all y \u2208 Y .

We will prove this by induction on n. By (2.8), the statement is true for n = 2, and we assume it\nholds for n \u2212 1.

By (2.14), \u03a91Y (log \u22061,2 ) \u2243 \u03c9Y \u2297 OY (\u22061,2 ) is an ample line bundle on Y .\nLet \u03b3 : C \u2192 X be a non-constant morphism from a complete nonsingular curve C, such that \u03b3(C) \u2229 (X \u2212\n\u22062,1 \u2212 f \u22121 (B)) 6= \u2205. Suppose first that \u03b3(C) is contained in a fiber of f , say \u03b3(C) \u2286 Xy . Since \u03b3 : C \u2192 Xy\n/ \u22061,2 and hence Xy \u2229 \u22062,1 = \u2205. Since y \u2208\n/ B,\nis finite, it suffices to show that \u03a9X |Xy is ample. Note that y \u2208\nthe same argument as in (2.7) shows that the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 TX/Y |Xy \u2192 TX |Xy \u2192 f \u2217 TY |Xy \u2192 0\ndoes not split. Hence,\n0 \u2192 f \u2217 \u03a91Y (log \u22061,2 )|Xy \u2192 \u03a91X (log \u22062,1 )|Xy \u2192 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 )|Xy \u2192 0\n/ \u22061,2 .\ndoes not split. Now, f \u2217 \u03a91Y (log \u22061,2 )|Xy \u2243 OXy , and \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 )|Xy \u2243 \u03c9Xy is ample, since y \u2208\nThus, by (2.5), \u03a9X |Xy is an ample vector bundle on Xy .\nNext suppose that \u03b3(C) is not contained in a fiber of f , so f \u03b3 : C \u2192 Y is non-constant. Since \u03c9Y \u2297\nOY (\u22061,2 ) is ample, \u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 (\u03c9Y \u2297 OY (\u22061,2 )) is also ample. To show that \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X (log \u22062,1 ) is ample, it suffices to\nshow that \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 ) is ample. We have a smooth family X \u2212 \u22062,1 \u2212 f \u22121 B \u2192 Y \u2212 \u22061,2 \u2212 B which\n11\n\n\fsatisfies the conditions of (2.3(2)), thus for m sufficiently large and divisible f\u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 + f \u22121 B)m is\nample with respect to Y \u2212 \u22061,2 \u2212 B. Furthermore, for m sufficiently large\nf \u2217 f\u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 + f \u22121 B)m \u2192 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 + f \u22121 B)m\nis surjective over X \u2212 \u22062,1 \u2212 f \u22121 B. Since \u03b3(C) \u2229 (X \u2212 \u22062,1 \u2212 f \u22121 (B)) 6= \u2205, we find that \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 +\nf \u22121 B)m is ample with respect to a dense open set of the curve C, and hence that \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 + f \u22121 B)\nis an ample line bundle on C. Since f \u22121 B is reduced, \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 + f \u22121 B) \u2243 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 ) is also\nample.\nThus, we have the following short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 f \u2217 \u03a91Y (log \u22061,2 ) \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X (log \u22062,1 ) \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X/Y (log \u22062,1 ) \u2192 0,\nwith the outer terms ample, so \u03b3 \u2217 \u03a91X (log \u22062,1 ) is ample. Therefore, \u03a91X (log \u22062,1 ) is quasi-ample with respect\nto X \u2212 \u22062,1 \u2212 f \u22121 (B).\n\u0003\nWe now prove the general case\nTheorem 2.16.

We will prove this by induction on n. By (2.15), the theorem is true for n = 2. Suppose it is true for\nn \u2212 1.

We must show that \u03a9X (log \u2206n,n\u22121 )|Xy is ample. Note, that y \u2208\nXy \u2229 \u2206n,n\u22121 = \u2205.\nNote, \u2206i,1 \u2286 \u2206i,i\u22121 for all i, since if t \u2208 \u22061,i , then fi\u22121 * * * f2\u22121 (t) is singular, hence there exists y \u2208 Xtj\nfor some 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i \u2212 1, such that Xyj+1 is singular, that is y \u2208 \u2206j,j+1 . Thus, \u2206i,1 \u2286 fi\u2217 \u2206i\u22121 = \u2206i,i\u22121 . So if\nwe define s := f2 f3 * * * fn\u22121 (y) \u2208 X 1 , then s \u2208\n/ \u2206i,1 for all i \u2264 n, so each Xsi is a smooth projective variety\nover C of dimension i \u2212 1.

Constructing Towers of Smooth Projective Varieties\nIn this section we construct a tower of smooth projective varieties over the complex numbers and smooth\nmorphisms between them of maximal variation. We first recall a construction of Kodaira, which for any n\nproduces a g for which Mg contains a complete n-dimensional subvariety, see [7], [16].\nLemma 3.1. [16] Let K be a field, D a curve over K of genus g(D) \u2265 2, and Q \u2208 D(K). Suppose\nchar(K) 6= 2, 3. Then there exists a finite extension K \u2282 L and a covering C \u2192 D of degree 3 defined over\nL, totally ramified in C \u220b P 7\u2192 Q \u2208 D, and unramified elsewhere.\n13\n\n\fBy keeping D fixed, and letting the point Q vary we construct a family of non-singular projective curves\nparametrized by a covering D\u2032 of D and its image is a complete curve in Mg(C) , where g(C) = 3g(D) \u2212 1.\nIterating this construction, that is, considering all covers of degree three of curves in the family {C\u03bb } ramified\nat one point, we get a complete 2-dimensional family of curves of genus 9g(D) \u2212 4. In general, we obtain a\ncomplete n-dimensional family of curves of genus 3n g(D) \u2212 (3n \u2212 1)/2.\nWe now work over C and fix a curve C0 of genus two. Consider {C\u03bb } the set of degree three covers of\nC0 ramified in one point. These are parametrized by some curve B0 , a cover of C0 . Thus we get a map\ng \u2032 : {C\u03bb } \u2192 B0 with fibers C\u03bb for \u03bb \u2208 B0 . Now, {[C\u03bb ]}, the image of {C\u03bb } in M5 is a complete curve, hence\ng \u2032 must be nonisotrivial.\nFor each \u03bb \u2208 B0 , we can iterate this construction. For a fixed \u03bb0 \u2208 B0 , consider {C\u03bb0 ,\u03bc }, the set of degree\nthree covers of C\u03bb0 ramified in one point, paramatrized by some curve B\u03bb0 . For this fixed \u03bb0 , {[C\u03bb0 ,\u03bc ]} is a\ncomplete curve in M14 , so f\u03bb0 : {C\u03bb0 ,\u03bc } \u2192 B\u03bb0 is nonisotrivial. Letting \u03bb vary, we get a smooth projective\nmorphism f : X \u2192 Y where X = {C\u03bb,\u03bc } and Y = {B\u03bb } are projective varieties of dimension 3 and 2,\nrespectively. I claim that for any p \u2208 Y , the set {q \u2208 Y |Xp \u2243 Xq } is finite, so in particular Var f = 2.\nIndeed, if p, q \u2208 B\u03bb0 for some \u03bb0 , then since f\u03bb0 is nonisotrivial, Xp is not isomorphic to Xq . Next suppose\nF1 is any fiber of f with F1 \u2208 C\u03bb1 ,\u03bc , then, in particular, F1 is a covering of C\u03bb1 . But F1 can only cover\nfinitely many curves, hence F1 can be isomorphic to at most finitely many other fibers Fi \u2208 C\u03bbi ,\u03bc . Thus any\nfiber of f is isomorphic to finitely many other fibers, and hence for any p \u2208 Y , the set {q \u2208 Y |Xp \u2243 Xq } is\nfinite.\nLet g : Y \u2192 B0 be the composition Y = {B\u03bb } \u2192 {C\u03bb } \u2192 B0 . If B\u03bb \u2243 B\u03bb\u2032 for general \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 \u2208 B0 , then\neither C\u03bb \u2243 C\u03bb\u2032 for general \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 \u2208 B0 or B\u03bb covers infinitely many non-isomorphic curves, both of which\nlead to a contradiction. Hence g : Y \u2192 B0 is nonisotrivial. Thus we have the tower\nX\n\nf\n\n/Y\n\ng\n\n/ B0\n\nof smooth projective varieties with dim X = 3, dim Y = 2, dim B0 = 1, and smooth morphisms of maximal\nvariation.
