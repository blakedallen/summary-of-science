In order to be au-\n\ntonomi ally managed, a lega y appli ation, for example a J2EE appli ation server, must be\nwrapped inside a Fra tal\n\nomponent. Thus, a\n\nommon interfa e is provided to manage these\n\nlega y appli ations from the Jade framework [2, 3\u2104. Jade deploys the modules that\n\nonstitute\n\nthe ar hite ture of the wrapped lega y appli ation and mirrors this ar hite ture in order to\nfurther monitor it. As Jade needs to deploy and remove lega y modules, appli ations have\nto be deployed as bundles on OSGi platforms. The Jade system itself is deployed as OSGi\nbundles. Thus, this requires the previous deployment of OSGi gateways. The\nsupport for Jade is Os ar,\n\nhttp://os ar.obje tweb.org an open sour\n\nOSGi. Indeed, the use of OSGi permits very easily the autonomi\nated) modules in\n\nurrently used\n\ne implementation of\n\n(re)deployment of (repli-\n\nase of failure or poor performan es, by simply uploading OSGi bundles\n\non available OSGi gateways already running the Jade system.\nEnabling Jade to apply its autonomi\njust a\n\n\u0088\n\nmanagement strategies at a grid level instead of\n\nluster of ma hines has the following underlying aims:\nto give better performan e s alability of the deployed lega y appli ation, as the number\nof repli a\n\nan be in reased as will (not taking into\n\nonsideration other aspe ts su h as\n\ndatabase repli ation whi h may not well apply at a grid s ale \u0015 this is an other matter,\nalso studied in Automan),\n\n\u0088\n\nto in rease \u001dexibility, as all repli a are not\nluster and\n\nonstrained to be lo ated on the same\n\nan be migrated or restarted on other ma hines to e.g. better balan e the\n\noverall load of the\n\nlusters or desktop ma hines forming the grid.\n\nThese aims pose requirements on the management system, i.e. Jade:\n\n\u0088\n\napability to deploy itself and the appli ative modules on any\n\nomputing environment.\n\nFor this, the ProA tive grid middleware developed within the OASIS team [1, 4\u2104\nbe relevant as it supports a\n\non\u001cgurable deployment model: through\n\nXML-based deployment des riptors, the user\n\nan abstra t away proto ols, job submis-\n\nsion systems, and laun h or get a\n\nRR\n\nan\n\nompletely open,\n\nn\u00b0 6340\n\ness to a pro ess (a native pro ess or a JVM).\n\n\fRuz & Baude & Legrand-Contes\n\n4\n\n\u0088\n\napability to enable Jade-level and appli ation-level\nti ipating entity, whatever its lo ation.\nrelevant.\n\nommuni ation between any par-\n\nHere again, the use of ProA tive\n\nould be\n\nBoth inter ProA tive runtimes and ProA tive a tive obje ts or software\n\nomponents\n\nommuni ations take grid\n\nonstraints into\n\nonsideration (laten y hiding\n\nthrough asyn hronous with future remote single or multipoint method invo ation,\non-demand se urisation of\ntion).\n\nThe\n\nommuni ations \u0015 authenti ation, non repudiation, en ryp-\n\nonstraints in order to get immediate advantage of su h properties (at\n\nleast within Jade itself ) would be to rely on ProA tive instead of Fra tal RMI for the\nintera tions between the Fra tal Jade\n\n\u0088\n\nomponents.\n\napability to share and distribute the management related operations and asso iated\nmessaging a\n\nording to the way the managed system is deployed (amount and lo ation\n\nof the repli as).\nThis means that the ar hite ture of the Jade system itself must be \u001dexible enough, to\nbe repli ated at a grid s ale. [2\u2104 previously devised a repli ated version of the Jade arhite ture for the purpose of making Jade itself a self-repairing system. Consequently,\nthe e\u001bort was put on the needed proto ols for the various Jade repli ated modules\n(Manager\n\nomponent) to always maintain a\n\noherent\n\nopy of the global state of the\n\nmanaged system and globally syn hronize their operations. Here, our aim is di\u001berent\nbe ause we aim at proposing a more s alable and grid-enabled version of the Jade\nar hite ture to better adhere to the e\u001be tive deployment of the managed appli ation.\nIndeed, Jade may be in\ntities or\n\nharge of a big number of widely distributed appli ative en-\n\nomponents at on e. So, the Jade monitoring operations (get sensed data,\n\ntrigger a tions, ...) must also be s alable and grid aware. This is why we \u001crst studied\nthe state of the art about grid monitoring: with the aim to get insight on how a monitoring system should be designed and operate onto either the set of grid resour es or\nthe set of appli ations deployed on this set.\nThis report \u001crst presents a short state of the art we\n\nolle ted about Grid Monitoring, with\n\nthe intention to get insight onto how to make Jade more grid-aware, i.e., more s alable. The\nfollowing se tions show some issues about the ar hite ture of Jade, des ribes how ProA tive\nan be used to deploy it on a grid, and \u001cnally suggests a hierar hi al organisation of Jade\nfor it to better suit s alability requirements.\n\nINRIA\n\n\fTowards Grid monitoring and deployment in Jade, using ProA tive\n2\n\n5\n\nState of the art on Grid monitoring\n\nIn this se tion, we brie\u001dy present and analyse some of the relevant works regarding ar hite tures for providing s alable and e\u001e ient Grid Monitoring.\n\n2.1\n\nGrid Information Servi es for Distributed Resour es Sharing\n\n2.1.1\n\nPaper referen e\n\nK.Czajkowski, S.Fitzgerald, I.Foster, C.Kesselman, Grid Information Servi es for Distributed\nResour es Sharing, 10th IEEE Int.
