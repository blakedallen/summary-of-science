The latter has the advantage of preserving all relevant symmetries whereas the former is usually regarded as breaking\nPoincare invariance through an explicit choice of a 'time' coordinate. However, as shown by Witten and Zuckerman [1, 2], the canonical formalism can\nalso be developed in a way that preserves all its relevant symmetries including Poincare invariance. This approach will be adopted to formulate a theory\nof classical and quantum systems with a new postulated symmetry between\ncoordinates and momenta.\nIn Hamiltonian mechanics the generalized coordinates qi and pi are accorded equal status and their Lagrange and Poisson brackets are canonical\ninvariants. This symmetry between the coordinates and momenta is lost\nwhen the particles are coupled to fields like the electromagnetic potential\nA\u03bc because the canonical four-momentum p\u03bc of a charged particle is then\nreplaced by the 'kinetic momentum' \u03c0\u03bc = p\u03bc \u2212 (e/c)A\u03bc whereas its canonical\ncoordinates q\u03bc remain unchanged [3]. The aim of this paper is to see under\nwhat conditions the symmetry between the coordinates and momenta can be\nrestored in this case, and to explore its consequences in quantum mechanics.\nThe starting point is the classical phase space defined as the space of\nsolutions of the classical equations. One can always, if one wishes, choose a\ncoordinate system with a time coordinate and identify the classical solutions\nwith the initial data in that coordinate system, but there is no necessity to\nmake such a non-covariant choice. The notion of a 'symplectic structure on\nphase space' is a more intrinsic concept than the idea of choosing coordinates\nqi and pi [2].\n\n2\n\nDifferential Geometric Preliminaries\n\nDifferential geometry has played a very useful role in the formulation of physical theories. Since certain basic concepts of differential geometry underlie the\nformulation of the present paper, it will be helpful to start by recapitulating\nthem and developing them with a view to apply them to the problem at hand.\nConsider the configuration space of a classical system which is generally a\nmanifold M with local charts (U, x), x(m, m \u2208 U) = q = (q1 , q2 , * * * , qn ) \u2208\nRn . One can define the tangent vectors Xiq = \u2202/\u2202q i , q \u2208 Rn and via the in2\n\n\fverse mapping x\u22121 the tangent vectors Xim = \u2202/\u2202xi , m \u2208 U. These tangent\nvectors span the tangent space at the point m \u2208 U and are fibres on M. The\nfibres on all points on M together with M constitute the tangent bundle\nT M. The dual to the tangent bundle is called the cotangent bundle T \u2217 M\nwith \u03c0 : T \u2217 M \u2192 M the projection. One can define a canonical one-form \u03b8\non T \u2217 M by [4]\n\u03b8(\u03b1)w = \u03b1.T \u03c0(w)\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 T \u2217 M and w \u2208 T\u03b1 (T \u2217 M). The canonical two-form is defined by\n\u03c9 = \u2212d\u03b8, d\u03c9 = 0. This is a reflection of the fact that T \u2217 M is a symplectic\nmanifold. If M is finite P\ndimensional, the formula for \u03b8 in a local chart (U, x)\nmay be written as \u03b8 = i pi dq i where the exterior derivatives dq i span the\ncotangent space and are dual to Xiq : hdq i , Xjq i = \u03b4ji . The pi are the\nP momenta\nconjugate to the coordinates qi . The two-form \u03c9(q, p) = \u2212d\u03b8 = i dq i \u2227 dpi\nand it is closed, i.e., d\u03c9 = 0. It is well-known that one can always associate\na Poisson manifold (T \u2217 M, {, }) with the sympletic manifold T \u2217 M. The\nfundamental Poisson brackets of qi and pj in a chart (U, x) are\n{qi , pj } = \u03b4ij .\n\n(2)\n\nT \u2217 M can be regarded as a 2n dimensional manifold called 'phase space' with\ncoordinates (q1 , * * * , qn , p1 , * * * , pn ) \u2208 U rather than a bundle.\nSimilarly, for infinite dimensional systems like fields one considers the\nmanifold B of potentials B\u03bc . The corresponding phase space is then the\ncotangent bundle T \u2217 B with the canonical symplectic structure. Since the\nLagrangian can be written as\nL=\u2212\n\n1\nFB\u03bc\u03bd FB\u03bc\u03bd ,\n4\u03c7\n\n(3)\n\nthe canonical momentum is \u03c0B\u03bc = (1/c \u03c7)FB\u03bc0 d3 x = (1/c \u03c7)FB\u03bc\u03bb \u03b7 \u03bb d3 x with\n\u03b7 \u03bb \u03b7\u03bb = \u22121. The canonical symplectic structure \u03c9 on T \u2217 B is\nZ\n\u03c9 ((B1 , \u03c0B1 ), (B2 , \u03c0B2 )) =\n(\u03c0B2 .B1 \u2212 \u03c0B1 .B2 )d3 x,\n(4)\nR3\n\nand the associated fundamental Poisson bracket is\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n\u03b4F \u03b4H\n\u03b4F \u03b4H\n\u2212\n.\nd3 x\n.\n{F, H}(B, \u03c0B ) =\n\u03b4B \u03b4\u03c0B\n\u03b4\u03c0B \u03b4B\nR3\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fTm\u2217 M\n\nd\u03c6\u2217m\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03c4m\n\nTm\u2217 \u2032 M\n\u03c4m\u2032\n\n\u2744\n\nTm M\n\n\u2732 \u2744\n\nTm\u2032 M\n\nd\u03c6m\n\nFigure 1: The commutative diagram illustrating the pull-back map d\u03c6\u2217m\nwhere \u03b4F/\u03b4B is the vector field defined by\nZ\n\u03b4F\n\u2032\n.

For further details, see [4].\nIf a manifold M is 'curved', the tangent spaces Tm M and Tm\u2032 M at two\ninfinitesimally separated neighbouring points m, m\u2032 \u2208 M are disjoint. The\nconnection is a mapping of these tangent spaces. Let \u03c6 : m \u2192 m\u2032 be a map.\nThen d\u03c6m : Tm M \u2192 T\u03c6(m) M, i.e., the tangent vectors to M at m are mapped\nto the tangent vectors to M at m\u2032 by the differential or covariant derivative\nd\u03c6m which consists of the ordinary partial derivative plus the connection.\nThis is the connection map d\u03c6m (Fig. 1). Let \u03c4m : Tm\u2217 M \u2192 Tm M and\n\u03c4m\u2032 : Tm\u2217 \u2032 M \u2192 Tm\u2032 M. Then d\u03c6\u2217m : Tm\u2217 M \u2192 Tm\u2217 \u2032 M is the pullback map. In\nterms of local charts on the manifold let the map\np\u2192\u03c0 =p\u2212\n\n2m\nB\nc\n\n(7)\n\ncorrespond to the pullback map d\u03c6\u2217m , and let the coordinates of the Tm\u2217 M\nbundle be (Q, \u03c0). Since (q, p) and (B, \u03c0B ) are canonical pairs, we have\nQ=q\u2212\n\nc\n\u03c0B .\n2m\n\n(8)\n\nOne can regard (q, Q) \u2208 V \u00d7 V where V is a vector space and (p \u2297 \u03c0) \u2208\nV \u00d7V . Then one has a nondegenerate symplectic two-form on V \u00d7V \u00d7V \u00d7V\ngiven by\n\u03c9 ((q, Q)1 , (p \u2297 \u03c0)1 , (q, Q)2 , (p \u2297 \u03c0)2 ) = (p1 \u2297 \u03c01 )(q1 , Q1 ) \u2212 (p2 \u2297 \u03c02 )(q2 , Q2 )\n= \u03c01 (q1 ) . p1 (Q1 ) \u2212 \u03c02 (q2 ) . p2(Q2 ). (9)\n4\n\n\fConsider the phase spaces (Q, p) \u2208 VQ \u00d7 VQ\u2217 and (q, \u03c0) \u2208 Vq \u00d7 Vq\u2217 . The total\nspace is VT = VQ \u00d7 VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq \u00d7 Vq\u2217 . Now consider the projections P1 VT =\nVQ \u00d7 VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq\u2217 \u2261 V \u2032 and P2 V \u2032 = VQ \u00d7 Vq\u2217 . Then P2 P1 VT = VQ \u00d7 Vq\u2217 , and\n(Q, \u03c0) \u2208 VQ \u00d7 Vq\u2217 . This shows that the space Q-\u03c0 is a projection of the\nhigher dimensional phase space VT that allows Hamiltonian flows. Similarly,\nconsider the projections P3 VT = VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq \u00d7 Vq\u2217 \u2261 V \u2032\u2032 and P4 V \u2032\u2032 = VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq .\nThen P4 P3 VT = VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq , and (p, q) \u2208 VQ\u2217 \u00d7 Vq , which shows that the space\np-q is another projection of VT whose dual is the space Q-\u03c0.\n\n3\n\nClassical Theory\n\nWith this differential geometric background let us consider the phase space\nof a relativistic particle coupled to a gauge field B. Let QI , I = 1, 2, ..., 2N\nwith Qi = \u03c0 i for i \u2264 P\nN = 4 and Qi = q i\u2212N for i > N. Then the closed\ntwo-form is \u03c9(q, \u03c0) = i dq i \u2227 d\u03c0i and the 2N \u00d7 2N antisymmetric matrix\n\u03c9IJ whose non-zero matrix elements are \u03c9i, i+N = \u2212\u03c9i+N, i = 1 is invertible.\nOne can define the Poisson bracket of any two functions F (QI ) and G(QI )\nby\n[F, G] = \u03c9 IJ\n\n\u2202F \u2202G\n\u2202QI \u2202QJ\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c9 IJ is the inverted matrix [2]. Corresponding definitions can be given\nfor the field B following the previous section.\nLet the 'kinetic' momentum of the particle be\n2m\nB\u03bc\n(11)\nc\nwhere 2m is the \"charge\" of the particle. Following the arguments of the\nprevious section (Eqns. (7) and (8)), let us define the new variable Q, the\n'kinetic coordinate', by\n\u03c0 \u03bc = p\u03bc \u2212\n\nQ\u03bc = q \u03bc \u2212\n\nc \u03bc\n\u03c0 .\n2m B\n\n(12)\n\nUsing the canonical Poisson brackets\n{q \u03bc , p\u03bd } = g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n{q \u03bc , \u03c0 \u03bd } = g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n{B \u03bc , \u03c0B\u03bd } = g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n5\n\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n\n\fone obtains\n{Q\u03bc , Q\u03bd } = 0,\n{Q\u03bc , \u03c0 \u03bd } = {q \u03bc , p\u03bd } +\n\n{\u03c0B\u03bc , B \u03bd }\n\n(16)\n= g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(17)\n\nand\n{Q\u03bc , p\u03bd } = {q \u03bc , p\u03bd } \u2212 {\n\nc \u03bc \u03bd\n\u03c0B , p } = g \u03bc\u03bd .\n2m\n\n(18)\n\nIt follows from these results that in addition to (q, \u03c0) one can also choose\n(Q, p) as a canonical pair.\nAs explained in the previous section, Eqn. (11) is the momentum space\nrepresentation (or pullback map) of the covariant derivative d\u03c6m which takes\nthe coordinate form\ni\nB\u03bc.\n(19)\nD\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u2212\n2m\u03c7\nwith B as the connection. \u03c0B connects the two coordinates q and Q (Eqn.\n12) just as B connects the two momenta p and \u03c0 (Eqn. 11). Just as \u03c0 is the\nkinematic momentum of the particle conjugate to its canonical position q,\nthe Poisson bracket (18) implies that Q is the kinematic position conjugate\nto the canonical momentum p. Q and \u03c0 carry global information about\nthe configuration manifold of the particle through the connection B and its\nconjugate \u03c0B .\nAn important and well-known property of covariant derivatives is that\nthey do not commute,\n[D \u03bc , D \u03bd ] = \u2212\n\ni\nF \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2m\u03c7 B\n\n(20)\n\nthe commutator being the curvature FB\u03bc\u03bd of the connection. This noncommutativity of the covariant derivatives is a classical (i.e., non-quantum\ntheoretic) result following from the geometrical fact that parallel transporting a vector around a closed loop on a curved manifold results in a different\nvector. This failure to return to the initial vector is known as holonomy.\nThus, the covariant derivatives carry global information about the manifold.\nThus, the postulated symmetry between the 'kinematic' momenta and\ncoordinates of the particle requires the connection B to be dynamical (Eqn.\n15) and the space-time manifold to be non-flat (Eqn. 20). However, the local\ncharts on which the equations are written are all flat.\n6\n\n\fThe total Hamiltonian of the interacting system is therefore\nH = HP (p \u2212 (2m/c)Ag = \u03c0) + HGEM (Ag , \u03c0g \u2212 (2m/c)q = \u2212(2m/c)Q). (21)\nThe equations of motion for the particle in terms of the variables (Q, p) are\nthen\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\nQ\u0307\u03bc = {Q\u03bc , H}(Q,p) = \u03bc , \u1e57\u03bc = {p\u03bc , H}(Q,p) = \u2212 \u03bc ,\n(22)\n\u2202p\n\u2202Q\nand in terms of the variables (q, \u03c0), they are\nq \u0307\u03bc = {q\u03bc , H}(q,\u03c0) =\n\n\u2202H\n,\n\u2202\u03c0 \u03bc\n\n\u03c0\u0307\u03bc = {\u03c0\u03bc , H}(q,\u03c0) = \u2212\n\n\u2202H\n.\n\u2202q \u03bc\n\n(23)\n\nThese equations show that (q, p) act as the fundamental canonical variables\nensuring Hamiltonian flows underlying the evolution of the kinematic variables (Q, \u03c0). The Q-\u03c0 space of the particle is a projection of a higher dimensional phase space VT -it is dual to the canonical phase space p-q (see\nptevious section).\n\n4\n\nQuantum Theory\n\nIt is now straightforward to construct the quantum theory of the system by\nadopting the standard canonical procedure of replacing the classical Poisson\nbrackets (13) through (18) by commutators. One gets\n[q \u03bc , \u03c0\u0302 \u03bd ] = [q \u03bc , p\u0302\u03bd ] = i~ g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(24)\n\n[B \u03bc , \u03c0\u0302B\u03bd ] = i~ g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(25)\n\n[Q\u0302\u03bc , \u03c0\u0302 \u03bd ] = [q \u03bc , p\u0302\u03bd ] + [\u03c0\u0302B\u03bc , B \u03bd ] = 0,\n\n(26)\n\n[Q\u0302\u03bc , p\u0302\u03bd ] = i~ g \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(27)\n\u03c0\u0302B\u03bc (=\n\nIt follows from these commutators that p\u0302\u03bc (= \u2212i~\u2202 \u03bc ),\n\u2212i~\u03b4/\u03b4B\u03bc ), q \u03bc ,\nQ\u0302\u03bc and \u03c0\u0302 \u03bc are all hermitian. Hence, \u03c0\u0302 \u03bc = \u2212i~\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 (2m/c)B \u03bc and therefore\n[\u03c0\u0302 \u03bc , \u03c0\u0302 \u03bd ] =\n\n2im~ \u03bc\u03bd\nFB\nc\n\n(28)\n\nbut\n[Q\u0302\u03bc , Q\u0302\u03bd ] = 0.\n7\n\n(29)\n\n\fA comparison of (20) and (28) shows that the latter is a consequence of\nthe curvature and holonomy of the connection B. Thus, this commutator\ncarries global information about the configuration manifold. For example, it\nvanishes in flat space-time regions where FB\u03bc\u03bd = 0 but B \u03bc 6= 0 and ~ 6= 0.\nAs in the classical theory, Q\u0302 and \u03c0\u0302 are the 'kinematic' coordinate and momentum operators respectively of the interacting particle which carry global\ninformation about the manifold, whereas p\u0302 and q\u0302 are the local canonical\nmomentum and coordinate operators respectively that enable underlying\nHamiltonian (or Schr\u00f6dinger) evolutions to occur. Significantly, Q\u0302 and \u03c0\u0302\nhave simultaneous eigenvalues because of (26). This implies that quantum\ntheory admits 'trajectories' of the particle in the Q-\u03c0 space. One can define\nthe density operator\nX\nX\npj = 1\n(30)\npj |\u03c8j ih\u03c8j |,\npj \u2265 0,\n\u03c1\u0302 =\nj\n\nj\n\nwith |\u03c8j i forming a complete set of states that are simultaneous eigenstates\nof Q\u0302 and \u03c0\u0302. It satisfies the evolution equation\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0302\n= [H, \u03c1\u0302].\n\u2202t\nHence, one can define the density function of the trajectories as\ni~\n\nG(Q, \u03c0, t) = hQ, \u03c0|\u03c1\u0302(t)|Q, \u03c0i\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nwith\n\u03c1\u0302(t) = U(t)\u03c1\u0302(0)U \u2020 (t),\n\nU(t) = e\u2212iHt/~.\n\n(33)\n\nIt is important to point out here that despite the existence of 'trajectories'\nin the theory, there are important differences from the Bohm theory [5]. The\nBohm theory imposes an additional condition, namely the guidance condition on standard quantum mechanics to define trajectories in configuration\nspace (the \"hidden variables\"). The trajectories in the Q-\u03c0 space are, on the\nother hand, consequences of the postulated new symmetry. Furthermore, the\n'guidance condition' in the Bohm theory results in trajectories in configuration space whose initial distribution must be chosen to be identical with the\nquantum mechanical distribution (the \"quantum equilibrium hypothesis\").\nThe continuity equation then ensures that this identity is preserved in time.\nThe trajectories in Q-\u03c0 space, on the other hand, are consequences of the\ncommutation relations (26) which are preserved in time, and the distribution\nof the trajectories is automatically determined by the theory for all times.\n8\n\n\fThe Measurement Problem\nThe postulated new symmetry as well as gauge covariance imply that\nQ\u0302 and \u03c0\u0302 rather than q\u0302 and p\u0302 must be regarded as the 'observables' for the\nparticle. It follows from this that the trajectories of the particles in Q \u2212 \u03c0\nspace can account for the occurrence of individual stochastic events in spacetime. There is no need therefore for any additional hypothesis like an external\nobserver or 'collapse/reduction' of the state vector. The theory is thus free\nof the so called 'measurement problem' in a manner analogous to Bohm's\ntheory [6].\nOne might suspect that the trajectories imply conflict with the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. This is not the case for the following reason. The\nstandard commutation relations from which the uncertainty relations are believed to follow still hold for the canonical position q and momentum p of\nthe particle (24) and also for q and \u03c0 (24) and Q and p (27). Although there\nis no such restriction on Q and \u03c0 (26) and a particle can have simultaneous sharp values of these variables, actual measurements of Q and \u03c0 over\nan ensemble of trajectories will nevertheless exhibit the statistical 'scatter\nrelation' \u2206Q \u2206\u03c0 \u2265 ~/2 because the trajectory distribution in the ensemble\nis determined by the density function (32) at all times [8].\n\n5\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have seen that the postulated new symmetry between the coordinates\nand momenta of particles coupled to an Abelian gauge field requires the field\nto be a dynamical connection in a non-flat space-time manifold. An attractive feature of this new symmetry is the natural occurrence of trajectories\nin Q-\u03c0 space in the quantum theory, which frees the theory of the measurement problem characteristic of quantum mechanics in flat space-time. Since\nnon-flat space-time is characteristic of gravity, it is tempting to speculate\nthat a possible physical interpretation of the gauge potential B is gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) in which the canonical momentum of a particle is\ngiven by the relation (11) with 2m as the \"gravitational charge\" and \u03c7 = G,\nthe Newtonian gravitational constant. As shown by several authors, GEM\nis a consequence of splitting the general relativistic space-time manifold into\nspace and time locally [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. If this interpretation is indeed\npossible, it would be indicative of a deep connection between quantum theory and gravity, at least in its post-Newtonian linearized form. However, it\n9\n\n\fis premature to draw any conclusion about full quantum gravity from these\nconsiderations.\nThis paper is a sequel to \"A Relativistic Particle and Gravitoelectromagnetism\" and is an alternative approach to it in which the role of gravitomagnetism is subsidiary to the postulated new symmetry.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
