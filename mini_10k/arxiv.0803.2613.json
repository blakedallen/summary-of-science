The standard lore\nis related to the modification of right hand side of the Einstein equations supplementing the stress energy tensor by\na dark energy component[1]. Recently, serious attempts\nhave been made to modify the geometry itself or the original Einstein-Hilbert action. A large number of papers\nare currently devoted to the investigations of f (R) gravities(see review[2] and references therein). These theories\nare motivated by phenomenological considerations. The\nproblems faced by these theories can be circumvented\nin specific models[3]. It is really interesting that these\nmodels do not reduce to cosmological constant \u039b in the\nlow curvature regime and thus can be distinguished from\nthe latter. However, in any proposal on modification of\ngravity at large scales, it becomes mandatory to check\nwhether the local gravity constraints are satisfied. The\nlatter can be achieved for specific f (R) gravity models\nprovided one invokes the chameleon scenario[3, 4] a la\nGreek epicycle.\nIt is also of crucial importance to explore the possibility of obtaining late time acceleration from a fundamental\ntheory. Thus the string curvature corrections to gravity\nand their cosmological relevance is a subject of current\ninterest. Attempts have recently been made to derive\ncurrent acceleration using the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term\nand higher order curvature invariants coupled to a dynamically evolving scalar field [5]. The model with GB\ninvariant exhibits a remarkable property that it does not\ndisturb the scaling regime and can give rise to late time\ntransition from matter regime to late time acceleration\n(see Ref.[6]and references therein). Unfortunately, the\n\ncoupling of GB term to scalar field gets large at late\ntimes; the nucleosynthesis also imposes stringent constraints on these models. Inclusion of higher order corrections introduces further technical complications [7].\nMost of the proposals aimed to describe the late time\ncosmic evolution are faced with one or the other problem. Recently, an interesting idea of using non-locally\ncorrected Einstein theory was put forward in [8, 9]. These\ncorrections typically involve combinations of inverse of\nd'Alembertian of the Ricci scalar and might be induced\nby quantum loops and (or) stringy considerations. Being non-local in character, these extra terms added to\nEinstein-Hilbert action can lead to late time acceleration as a time delayed effect avoiding the fine tuning\nproblem[8]. The non-local dynamics can be cast in a\nlocal form by introducing a number of auxiliary fields[9].\nIn this paper, we consider the simplest form of nonlocal corrections to gravity and investigate the underlying\ncosmological dynamics in details. We explore the possibility of a matter like regime which can finally mimic\n(phantom) dark energy and in particular the de Sitter\nsolution, at late times. The entropy of de Sitter space in\nnon-local gravity is also briefly discussed.\n\nII.\n\nNON-LOCAL COSMOLOGY AND ITS LATE\nTIME ATTRACTORS\n\nIn what follows we consider the local form of nonlocally corrected gravity. Let us consider the following\nsimple example of the non-local action [8]\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd x \u2212g\n4\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0001\nR\n1 + f (\u0003\u22121 R) + Lmatter\n2\n2\u03ba\n\n\u001b\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere f is some function of d'Alembertian and denoted\nby \u0003. The action would lead to non-local equations of\nmotion which are difficult to investigate. The above action can be cast into local form by introducing two scalar\nfields \u03c6 and \u03be[9]\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n4 \u221a\n{R (1 + f (\u03c6)) + \u03be (\u0003\u03c6 \u2212 R)}\nS =\nd x \u2212g\n2\u03ba2\ni\n+Lmatter\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n=\nd4 x \u2212g\n{R (1 + f (\u03c6)) \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03be\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u03beR}\n2\u03ba2\ni\n(2)\n+Lmatter .\n\nThe equivalence of actions (1) and (2) can easily be\nchecked. Indeed, by varying the action over \u03be, we obtain\n\u0003\u03c6 = R or \u03c6 = \u0003\u22121 R,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich after substitution into (2), gives the original action\n(1).\nThe local equations of motion can now be derived by\nvarying with respect to the metric and the auxiliary fields\n\u03c6 and \u03be. Variation of (2) with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd gives\n1\n0 = g\u03bc\u03bd {R (1 + f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) \u2212 \u2202\u03c1 \u03be\u2202 \u03c1 \u03c6}\n2\n1\n\u2212R\u03bc\u03bd (1 + f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) + (\u2202\u03bc \u03be\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03be)\n2\n\u2212 (g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd ) (f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) + \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd .\n(4)\nThe variation with respect to \u03c6 leads to\n0 = \u0003\u03be + f \u2032 (\u03c6)R .\n\n(5)\n\nFor obvious reason, we shall specialize to FRW background with the metric\nX\n\u00012\n(6)\ndxi ,\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2\ni=1,2,3\n\nin which case the scalar fields \u03c6 and \u03be are functions of\ntime alone. In the FRW background, the time-time and\nthe space-space components of Eq.(4) yield the modified\nHubble equation and equation for acceleration\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 = \u22123H 2 (1 + f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) \u2212 3H f \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 \u03be \u0307\n1\n+ \u03be \u0307\u03c6\u0307 + \u03ba2 \u03c1 ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n0 = 2\u1e22 + 3H 2 (1 + f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) + \u03be \u0307\u03c6\u0307\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nd\nd\n(f (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be) + \u03ba2 p .\n+ 2H\n+\ndt2\ndt\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c1 and p refer to the energy density and pressure\nof the background fluid and satisfy the usual continuity\nequation\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H(1 + w)\u03c1 = 0\n\n(9)\n\nwith w being the equation of state parameter of the background matter. The scalar field equations assume the\nfollowing form\n0 = \u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + 6\u1e22 + 12H 2 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 = \u03be\u0308 + 3H \u03be\u0307 \u2212 6\u1e22 + 12H 2 f \u2032 (\u03c6) .\n\n(10)\n\nf (\u03c6) = f0 e\u03b1\u03c6 ,\n\n(12)\n\n(11)\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we shall use the exponential\nform of f (\u03c6)\n\nwhere f0 and \u03b1 are constants. We shall now cast the\nunderlying dynamical equations in the autonomous form\nand look for dark energy solution as stable fixed points\nof the dynamics. We use the following notations (henceforth, we use the unit \u03ba2 = 1)\nN = ln a , x =\n\n\u03be \u0307\n\u03ba2 \u03c1\n\u03c6\u0307\n, y=\n, z= 2\n.

The stability of the critical points\ncan easily be analyzed. The eigenvalues of the stability\nmatrix for the autonomous system corresponding to the\nfirst critical point (xc , yc ) = (0, 0) are given by, {\u22121, \u22121}\nmaking it a stable node.

The phase space splits into two disjoint regions:\nall the trajectories starting from y > 3 converge to de Sitter\nwhere as they approach (0,0) for y < 3 and x > \u22124.\n\nIn this case, the eigenvalues of the stability matrix are\ngiven by, (3\u03b1 \u2212 2)/(3\u03b1 \u2212 1), (3\u03b1 \u2212 2)/(3\u03b1 \u2212 1). Thus the\nfixed point is stable provided that 1/3 < \u03b1 < 2/3 leading\nto dark energy solutions, \u2212\u221e < weff < \u22121/3; the stable\nde Sitter solution is obtained for \u03b1 = 1/2, see Fig.1. In\nFig.2, we have plotted the phase portrait demonstrating\nthe stability of both the critical points. Without the loss\nof generality, we have assumed both \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0307 to be negative which corresponds to a particular type of boundary\ncondition in Eq.(3)[8].

The above discussion of non-local cosmology is based upon the simplest version of non-locality.\nIndeed, we could start from a general non-local action:\nZ\n\u221a \u0002\nS =\nd4 x \u2212g F R, \u0003R, \u00032 R, * * * , \u0003m R, \u0003\u22121 R,\n\u0003\n\u0001\n(28)\n\u0003\u22122 R, * * * , \u0003\u2212n R + Lmatter .\n\u03c1 = \u2212\n\n-2\n\nxc = \u22124 ,\n\n\u03be = 1 + 3f0 e\u22122H0 t +\n\n(22)\n\nwith a restriction that \u03b1 = 3 (1 + w) /4. In this case, the\nfixed point is stable provided that w < 0.\n\nwith m and n being the positive integers. By introducing\nscalar fields A, B, \u03c7k , \u03b7k , (k = 1, 2, * * * , m), and \u03bel , \u03c6l ,\n(l = 1, 2, * * * , n), we may rewrite the action (28) in the\nfollowing form:\nZ\n\u221a\nS =\nd4 x \u2212g [BR \u2212 BA + F (A, \u03b71 , \u03b72 , * * * , \u03b7m ,\n\u03c61 , \u03c62 , * * * , \u03c6n ) + \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2202 \u03bc A +\n+\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03bel \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6l +\n\nl=1\n\n+Lmatter ] .\n\nm\nX\n\nk=1\n\nm\nX\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c7k \u2202 \u03bc \u03b7k\u22121\n\nk=2\n\n\u03c71 \u03b71 + A\u03be1 +\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bel \u03c6l\u22121\n\nl=2\n\n(29)\n\nThe variations over A, B \u03c7k , \u03bel leads to the following\nequations\n0 = R \u2212 A = \u03b71 \u2212 \u0003A = \u03b7k \u2212 \u0003\u03b7k\u22121 = \u0003\u03c61 \u2212 A\n= \u0003\u03c6l \u2212 \u03c6l\u22121 (k = 2, * * * , m, l = 2, * * * , n) . (30)\n\n\f4\nwhich gives \u03b7k = \u0003k R and \u0003l \u03c6l = R and we find that\nthe actions (29) and (28) are equivalent.\nLet us now consider a scale transformation given by\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192\n\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd .\n2B\n\n(31)\n\nThen the action (29) is transformed into the action in\nthe Einstein frame:\n\u0014\nZ\nR\n3\n4 \u221a\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03bc B\u2202 \u03bc B\nS = d x \u2212g\n2\n2B 2\n!\nm\nn\nX\nX\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n+\n\u2202\u03bc \u03bel \u2202 \u03c6l\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2202 A +\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c7k \u2202 \u03b7k\u22121 +\n2B\nk=2\n\nl=1\n\n1\n+ 2 (\u2212BA + F (A, \u03b71 , * * * , \u03b7m , \u03c61 , * * * , \u03c6n )\n4B\n#\n!\nn\nm\nX\nX\nA\n\u03bel \u03c6l\u22121 + Lmatter .\n\u03c71 \u03b71 + A\u03be1 +\n+\n\n(32)\n\nl=2\n\nk=1\n\nHere\ncan be obtained by scale transforming of\nthe metric tensor in Lmatter by (31). The above action\ncan be regarded as a non-linear \u03c3 model with potential\ncoupled to gravity. Action (1) can be thought as a particular case of the general non-local action. In this case,\nhowever, the continuity equation (9) is no longer valid;\nadditional terms on the right hand side of this equation\nare generated and are responsible for inducing interaction\nof matter with background [4]. This aspect is crucial for\nthe discussion of local gravity constraints on the models\nbased on the modified theories of gravity.\nTHE ENTROPY OF DE SITTER SPACE\n\nIn this Section, we shall investigate the de Sitter space\nentropy properties in non-local modified gravity with the\ncosmological constant and matter.\nThe starting point is the trace of equation of motion of\nthe non-local model, which reads, for a constant curvature solution and in the presence of a cosmological constant \u039b and matter, as\n(f (\u03c6) + 1 \u2212 \u03be) R = 4\u039b \u2212 \u03ba2 T\n+6f \u2032 (\u03c6)R + 3f \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6)\u2202\u03c1 \u03c6\u2202 \u03c1 \u03c6 + \u2202\u03c1 \u03be\u2202 \u03c1 \u03c6 ,\n\n(33)\n\nwith T the stress tensor trace. Let us suppose that\nspherically-symmetric, static, constant curvature solution exists\nds2 = \u2212A(r)dt2s + A(r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 d\u03a32 .\n\n(34)\n\nThere is a horizon if A(rH ) = 0 with A\u2032 (rH ) 6= 0 and\nrH > 0. Then there is also an entropy associated with\nthis horizon, entropy that may be evaluated using Wald's\nmethod. For the local action, one has\nSBH =\n\nAH\n[1 \u2212 \u03be + f (\u03c6)]rH ,\n4G\n\n\u0001\n\u2202t2s \u03c6\n1\n+ 2 \u2202r r2 A\u2202r \u03c6 = R ,\nA\nr\n\u0001\n\u22022 \u03be\n1\n\u2212 ts + 2 \u2202r r2 A\u2202r \u03be = \u2212f \u2032 (\u03c6)R .\nA\nr\n\n\u2212\n\n(36)\n\nOne may look for the solution of the first equation in the\nform \u03c6 = \u22124H0 ts \u2212 2 ln A(r). As a result, it follows that\nde Sitter space AdS (r) = 1 \u2212 Rr2 /12 is a solution. Then,\nit is easy to show that the solution for \u03be reads\n\u03be(r, ts ) = B +\n\n3f0\n(1 \u2212 H02 r2 )\u22122\u03b1 e\u22124\u03b1H0 ts .\n(4\u03b1 \u2212 3)\n\n(37)\n\nAs a result, the entropy factor becomes\n\nLA\nmatter\n\nIII.\n\nwith all the fields being evaluated on the horizon and\n2\n. Thus, in general, there is a violation of the\nAH = 4\u03c0rH\n\"Area Law\".\nWithin the above black hole like metric, Eq. \u0003\u03c6 =\nR and Eq. for the field \u03be read for time dependent and\nspherically symmetric fields as\n\n(35)\n\n(4\u03b1 \u2212 6)f0\n(1 \u2212 H02 r2 )\u22122\u03b1 e\u22124\u03b1H0 ts .\n(4\u03b1 \u2212 3)\n(38)\nAs a consequence, for \u03b1 > 0, the field \u03be and the entropy\nare, in general, divergent on the horizon, while, as soon\nas \u03b1 < 0, the \u03be field and the de Sitter entropy are finite\nand independent on the time ts on the horizon. However,\nthere exists a positive value, namely \u03b1 = 3/2, which renders the de Sitter entropy finite. We will see the physical\nsignificance of these two choices later.\nFurthermore, in order to satisfy Einstein equations, the\nchoice made for f (\u03c6) has to satisfy the trace constraint\n(33), where the stress tensor of the matter and cosmological constant contribution are present. A direct computation shows that the trace constraint is satisfied as soon as\n1\u2212B = \u039b/3H02 , and the stress tensor trace is not zero and\nis given by T = T0 AdS (r)\u22122\u03b1 e\u22124H0 \u03b1ts , where T0 depends\non \u03b1. Again, this trace diverges on the horizon as soon as\n\u03b1 > 0. Note that in the case \u03b1 = 23 , the entropy\n\u0001 of the de\nSitter solution reads SdS = (AH /4G) \u039b/3H02 . For vanishing cosmological constant we have found a de Sitter\nsolution with finite entropy which is vanishing! However,\nrecall the Wald method gives the entropy modulo a constant.\nIn the FRW space-time, the solutions we have obtained\nlead to\n1 \u2212 \u03be + f (\u03c6) = 1 \u2212 B +\n\n1 \u2212 \u03be + f (\u03c6) =\n\n\u039b\n\u03ba2 (1 \u2212 w)\u03c10 \u22123H0 (1+w)t\n+\ne\n, (39)\n2\n3H0 3H02 w(1 + 3w)\n\nwhile equation of motion for \u03be gives\n1 \u2212 \u03be + f (\u03c6) = 1 \u2212 B + f0\nA comparison with w 6= 1 gives\n1\u2212B =\n\n4\u03b1 \u2212 6 \u22124\u03b1H0 t\ne\n.\n4\u03b1 \u2212 3\n\n(40)\n\n\u039b\nk 2 \u03c10\n, 4\u03b1 = 3(1 + w) , f0 = \u2212\n,\n2\n2\n3H0\n3H0 (1 + 3w)\n(41)\n\n\f5\nwhile if w = 1, we have f0 undetermined. As a check, we\nmay pass to the static de Sitter patch by transforming\nthe time coordinate t = ts + (1/2H0) ln(1 \u2212 H02 r2 ), and\nnote that one gets equation (38) again.\nThus, the existence conditions found for the de Sitter entropy require a non vanishing positive cosmological\nconstant and matter and, in general, this matter, in order to have finite entropy, should be \"phantom\"matter,\nsince the condition \u03b1 < 0 is equivalent to 1 + w < 0.\nHowever, as already noted in the static patch, if we have\nmatter such as w = 1, namely stiff matter p = \u03c1, important in the early universe, the time dependence of\nthe entropy drops out, in agreement with the result obtained in the static gauge. One can also see that entropy\ndivergences in the static gauge correspond to the (nonphysical) time-dependence of entropy in the cosmological\ngauge and thus this situation seems problematic. This\nconsideration indicates that perhaps even the definition\nof entropy for non-local gravity should be reconsidered.\nIt is also interesting that AdS black hole solution for the\ntheory under consideration does not exist, while de Sitter\nsolution exists.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the cosmological\nrelevance of non-local corrections to gravity of the type\nf (\u0003\u22121 R) \u223c exp(\u03b1\u0003\u22121 R) which can be motivated by\nnon-perturbative quantum effects. Casting the equations\nin local form we analyzed the underlying dynamics and\nexplored the possibility of finding stable dark energy solutions. We have shown that the system might mimic\nthe matter dominated regime for a long time and ultimately switches over to dark energy solutions at late\ntimes thereby alleviating the fine tuning problem. The\nclass of the dark energy solutions is parameterized by \u03b1\nwhich ranges as 1/3 < \u03b1 < 2/3. The corresponding effective EoS parameter varies as, \u2212\u221e < weff < \u22121/3. In\ncase of \u03b1 > 1/2, we have non-phantom dark energy; the\nde Sitter solution is obtained for \u03b1 = 1/2. It is remarkable that there exists a range of the parameter, namely,\n1/3 < \u03b1 < 1/2 for which the model leads to phantom\n\n[1] V. Sahni and A. A. Starobinsky, Int. J. Mod. Phys.

Secondly,\nthe model under consideration does not involve negative\nkinetic energy fields. Unlike standard phantom theories\ngiving rise to transient phantom phase, the non-locally\ncorrected gravity leads to a class of phantom energy solutions which are the late time attractors of the dynamics.\nIt is also important to note that even if more precise observational data defines the EoS parameter to be\nslightly different from \u22121, there exists a possibility of realizing such scenario a in non-local gravity as the effective\nquintessence or phantom cosmology.\nInterestingly, the existence of de Sitter entropy in the\nnon-local model requires a non vanishing positive cosmological constant and phantom matter.\nLast but not the least, we should remember that the\nlow energy modifications of gravity crucially differ from\nthe corresponding local versions. In general, any large\nscale modification of gravity faces two major challenges:\nThe first is related to the presence of either the ghost or\nthe tachyon modes in these models; secondly, the solar\nphysics imposes stringent constraints on these models.\nThus it would be interesting to carry out these investigations for non-local theories, as discussed in this paper;\nwe defer this analysis to our future work. It would also\nbe interesting to investigate the complicated versions of\nnon-local gravity mentioned at the end of section II.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank V. Sahni and S.
