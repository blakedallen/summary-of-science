K.\nSchool of Studies in Physics, Pt. Ravishankar Shukla University, Raipur - 492010, India\n\nHD 52452 (V369 Gem, SAO 78998; V = 8.05, B \u2212 V = 0.67; G5 V) is one of the\nshortest period (0.d 42304) non-eclipsing chromospherically active binary star discovered\nso far. Its X-ray properties were discovered in the ROSAT all sky survey program and it\nis one among 383 relatively bright X-ray sources cataloged by Pounds et al. (1993). The\nstar HD 52452 is an optical counterpart of the EUV bright source RE J70222+255054\n(Mason et al. 1995) and its photometric and spectroscopic observations aimed at the\nclassification of EUV stellar sources detected by EXOSAT and ROSAT were carried by\nCutispoto et al. (1999, 2000). Furthermore, HD 52452 is also listed in the 2RE source\ncatalogue published by Pye et al. (1995). Messina et al. (2001) reported that HD 52452\nis a triple system consisting of a tidally coupled G4 V + late-G SB1 (responsible for\nthe most of the observed optical variability) and a G5 V companion. Their photometric\nobservations reveal that the observed photometric variability is due to the presence of\ncool spots on the photospheres of both component of the SB1 system. In this paper we\nreport the multi-band BVRI photometry of HD 52452.\nThe BVRI photoelectric photometric observations of HD 52452 were carried out during\ntwo observing runs - one during February 17 - March 23, 2000 for 8 nights and another one\nduring February 20 - February 26, 2001 for 6 nights. For the first observing run we have\na total of 158 data points and have 93 data points for the next one. The 40-cm SchmidtCassegrain LX 200 Meade telescope equipped with SSP-3A photoelectric photometer and\nJohnson standard broad-band BVRI filters were used for the observation. The telescope\nis situated on the campus of the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics\n(IUCAA) in Pune, India. The detector used in the SSP-3A photometer is a silicon PNphotodiode which is not cooled. The response function of the B, V, R and I filters with\nthe detector closely match those of the Johnson standard filters. In order to obtain\naccurate differential photometry, we used two nearby stars HD 52071 (K2 III, V = 7.11,\nB \u2212 V = 1.27) as comparison star and HD 50692 (G0 V, V = 5.76, B \u2212 V = 0.56) as\ncheck star. The mean of four to five independent differential magnitudes per observation in\neach band were corrected for atmospheric extinction and transformed into BVRI standard\nsystem. No significant light variation was detected for the differential magnitudes of the\ncomparison and check star \u2206Vc , which is a good measure of the quality of our observation.\nThe uncertainties in \u2206V , \u2206(B \u2212 V ), \u2206(V \u2212 R) and \u2206(V \u2212 I) are 0.015, 0.02, 0.017 and\n0.02 magnitudes, respectively.\nThe combined data for both 2000 and 2001 were analyzed to obtain the photometric period using a Scargle-Press period search routine (Scargle 1982, Horne & Baliunas\n\n\fIBVS 5553\n\n2\n\nTable 1: Photometric periods for HD 52452\n\nData set\nPeriod\nFAP (%)\n2000+Messina et al.

Photometric periods with error and false-alarm- probability\n(FAP in %) are listed in Table 1. To cross check our period search routine we also\nderived photometric period from Messina et al. (2001) data and a photometric period\n0.d 42309\u00b10.00017 with FAP 8.61 % was found which agrees well with the period (0.d 42304)\nreported by Messina et al. (2001). The slightly larger period for the epoch 2001 with\nMessina et al. (2001) data as compared to the other epoch may be due to the scatter in\nthe data covering long period.\nObserved data points have been folded in to a phase using the photometric ephemeris\nHJD = 2449672.0 + 0.d 42261 \u00d7 E. We divided our photometric data points into four\nsubsets (two for each epoch) and phase diagram for these subsets and associated colors\n(B \u2212 V ), (V \u2212 R) and (V \u2212 I) are shown in Figure 1 and 2 for the V band. The differential\nmagnitudes of the check star with respect to the comparison star Vc are shown in the\nsame diagrams. We have also shown the complete light curve for epoch 2000 and 2001\nin the panel (c) of Figure 1 and 2 respectively. Table 2 gives the epoch, JD interval, the\nminimum phase and maximum amplitude for observed data points.\nA significant variation in the light curve within the first year and between the two\nseasons from the phase diagrams is seen (Fig. 1 & 2). Small variations are observed for\nthe epoch 2000.132 but the data points are very scattered. Visual inspection of light curve\nfor the star HD 52452 reveals the existence of two minima separated from each other by\nabout half period in phase. This behavior is possibly due to the existence of two spots\non the stellar surface. The amplitude of light variation is \u223c0.24 magnitude in V band for\n2000.193, which is large compared to the \u223c0.16 magnitude in V band reported by Messina\net al. (2001). He also observed peaked light curve separated by 0.4 in phase. For the\nnext observing epochs 2001.140 and 2001.147 the amplitude of light variation decreases\nto \u223c0.14 and \u223c0.16 magnitude in V band respectively.\nThe (V \u2212 I) color curve for the epoch 2000.193 reveal the variation of \u223c0.7 magnitude\nbut except this, in general there are no significant variation for the (B \u2212 V ), (V \u2212 R) and\n(V \u2212 I) color indices. The observed variation in (V \u2212 I) color index can be attributed to\nthe lower spot temperature relative to the photosphere than in other cases. The present\nobservations clearly suggests that the optical variability in the star HD 52452 is due to\n\n\fIBVS 5553\n\n3\n\nthe presence of cool spots on the stellar surface.\nThe comparison of our data with previous observations reported by Messina et al.\n(2001) shows that there is a variation in amplitude, but the phases of the two minima,\nthus the positions of the spot, are quite stable during our observations. The very short\nphotometric period makes this star very interesting for studying the evolution of spots on\nstellar surface in terms of spot parameters over a longer time period.\n\nFigure 1.
