It could be used\nas an alternate way of showing how the value of e is obtained. No attempt is made to show the\nexistence of the limit in the definition of e that appears in the final equation.\n\n1. Introduction.\nTraditionally the value of e has been obtained, for instance, by taking the limit of ever-decreasing\ninterest intervals in the compound interest formula (see Greenleaf [1]) or linear interpolation (see\nFlanders and Price [2]). We describe an alternate technique of obtaining e that should have pedagogic value. In this section we give an approximation of e using this technique and generalize it\nin the next section.\nIf f \u2032 (x), the derivative of f (x), exists at point x, and you start at point x and move a distance \u2206x,\nthe value at the point x + \u2206 is given by\nf (x + \u2206x) \u223c\n= f (x) + f \u2032 (x) * \u2206x\n\n(1)\n\nWe want to find a constant, let's call it e, such that when it's raised to the power x obtaining the\nfunction ex , the function's derivative is also ex\u2021 .\nSince f \u2032 (x) equals f (x), we rewrite equation (1) as\nf (x + \u2206x) \u223c\n= f (x)(1 + \u2206x)\n\n(2)\n\nWe will analyse this in the interval [1,2]. Let's take x = 1 and \u2206x = 0.1. So x + \u2206x is 1.1. Equation\n(2) gives\nf (1.1) \u223c\n= f (1)(1 + 0.1)\n\n(3)\n\ne1.1 \u223c\n= 1.1e\n\n(4)\n\nor\n\n.\n\u2217\n\nThe initial version of this paper was submitted for publication on July12, 2009\nemail: marateck@courant.nyu.edu\n\u2021\nOur analysis also holds if f (x) = Cex where C is a constant.\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fNow take x = 1.1 and use the same value of \u2206x, i.e., 0.1. We will be using the same increment in\nx in this and all subsequent steps since eventually we will let \u2206x approach zero. Continuing in this\nway\nf (1.1 + 0.1) \u223c\n= 1.1f (1.1)\n\n(5)\n\ne1.2 \u223c\n= (1.1)2 e\n\n(6)\n\nSo f (1.2) \u223c\n= 1.1e1.1 . Or\n\nEventually we will get e2 on the left side of the equation, so we can solve for e. So let's compute\ne1.3 . We get e1.3 \u223c\n= 1.1e1.2 But this equals (1.1)3 e. If we extrapolate to x = 1.8, we see that\ne1.9 \u223c\n= (1.1)9 e\n\n(7)\n\ne2 \u223c\n= (1.1)10 e\n\n(8)\n\nand finally that\n\nSolving for e we get e \u223c\n= (1.1)10 or e equals 2.59 to three digits, where the 10 corresponds to dividing\n1 by 0.1. Equation (1) presupposes that \u2206x approaches zero. If we let \u2206x = .00000001, or 10\u22128 ,\nwe raise (1 + .00000001) to 108 . The answer for e is 2.71828 to five significan figures.\n2. Generalization.\nWe now sketch the steps that describe the preceding method in general. Using equation (2), and\nsetting x = 1, we write\ne1+\u2206x \u223c\n= e(1 + \u2206x)\n\n(9)\n\nWe continue, letting x = x + \u2206x and keeping \u2206x the same, and write\ne1+\u2206x+\u2206x \u223c\n= e1+\u2206x (1 + \u2206x)\n\n(10)\n\ne1+2\u2206x \u223c\n= e(1 + \u2206x)2\n\n(11)\n\nor\n\nWe have to add \u2206x to x 1/\u2206x times to get e2 on the left side of these equations. So we get\ne1+(1/\u2206x)*\u2206x \u223c\n= e(1 + \u2206x)1/\u2206x\n\n(12)\n\ne2 = e(1 + \u2206x)1/\u2206x\n\n(13)\n\nor\n\n2\n\n\fSolve for e and since the definition of the derivative in equation (1) lets \u2206x \u2192 0, take the same\nlimit here. We get\ne = lim (1 + \u2206x)1/\u2206x\n\u2206x\u21920\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is one of the definitions of e.\n3. References.\n[1] Greenleaf, Fredrick E..
