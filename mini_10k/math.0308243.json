W. Fulton\u2013R. MacPherson [15] found a Sullivan dg-algebra model for the space\nof n-configurations of a smooth compact complex algebraic variety X. I. K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [16] gave a\nsimpler model, En (H), depending only on the cohomology ring, H := H \u2217 X.\nWe construct an even simpler and smaller model, Jn (H). We then define another new\no\no\ndg-algebra, En (H), and use Jn (H) to prove that En (H) is a model of the space of no\nconfigurations of the non-compact punctured manifold X, when X is 1-connected. Following\nan idea of V.G. Drinfel'd [10], we put a simplicial bigraded differential algebra structure\no\non {En (H)}n\u22650 .\n\n1. Introduction and the main results\nLet X be a connected space. The topology of ordered configuration spaces\nF (X, n) := {(x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 X \u00d7n ; xi 6= xj if i 6= j}\nof n distinct labeled points in X has attracted a considerable attention, over the years.\nThe cohomology rings H \u2217 F (R2 , n) have been described by Arnold [1]. In his 1972 thesis,\nF. Cohen extended Arnold's computations to all Euclidean spaces; see [7]. For X an ldimensional real oriented manifold, the Leray spectral sequence of the inclusion F (X, n) \u0592\u2192\nX \u00d7n has been described by Cohen-Taylor [8] and further analyzed by Totaro [21]. With\nfield coefficients K, the above Cohen-Taylor spectral sequence converges multiplicatively\nto H \u2217 (F (X, n); K); it has the property that E2 = El , and the differential graded algebra\n(El , dl ) depends only on n and the cohomology algebra H \u2217 (X; K). See [8], [21]. If X is a\nsmooth projective complex m-variety, Totaro [21] showed, over Q, that E2m+1 = E\u221e , and\nH \u2217 (F (X, n); Q) = E2m+1 , as graded algebras.\nFor a compact oriented real l-manifold X, it is convenient to view F (X, n) as X \u00d7n \\ D n X,\nwhere D n X denotes the fat diagonal. Using Lefschetz duality, one may thus replace the\nBetti numbers of F (X, n) by those of the pair (X \u00d7n , D n X), modulo suitable regrading.\nIn this way, Brown and White [6] were able to compute the Betti numbers of F (X, n) in\nterms of the cohomology algebra of X, for n \u2264 3. For arbitrary n, Bendersky and Gitler\nhave constructed in [4] another spectral sequence, converging additively to H \u2217 (F (X, n); K),\nregraded via Lefschetz duality. They have also proved that E2 = E\u221e in their spectral\nThe second author supported by an EURROMMAT Invited Lecturer Fellowship (Contract ICA1\u2013CT\u2013\n2000\u201370022) and by the grant GA AV \u010cR 201/02/1390.

PAPADIMA\n\nsequence over Q, when X is rationally formal, in the sense of Sullivan [20] (for instance,\nwhen X is compact K\u00e4hler manifold, see [9]).\nAs it turns out, there is an additive isomorphism between the Bendersky-Gitler E2 -term\nand the Cohen-Taylor El+1-term, after regrading (this was proved independently in [17,\nTheorem 29], and in [13, Theorem 1]). Therefore, the additive part of Totaro's collapsing\nresult actually holds for Q-formal closed oriented manifolds. Nevertheless, the above spectral\nsequences for F (X, 4) do not collapse in general, as follows from the example given by F\u00e9lix\nand Thomas [13], where X is the sphere tangent bundle of S 2 \u00d7 S 2 .\nOur aim in this paper is to go beyond Betti numbers and cohomology algebras. We\nwill describe two new differential graded algebra (DGA) models, for K-homotopy types in\no\ncharacteristic zero (in the sense of Sullivan [20]) of configuration spaces, F (X, n) and F (X, n).\no\nHere X is a smooth compact complex algebraic m-variety, and X := X \\ pt denotes the\npunctured manifold.\nLet Y be a smooth complex algebraic variety. It is known that Y has a convenient compactification. That is, Y = Ye \\ D, where Ye is smooth compact, and D \u2282 Ye is a divisor with\nnormal crossings. A basic result of Morgan [18, Theorem 9.6 and Corollary 9.7] says then\nthat the C-homotopy type of Y is naturally determined by the C-cohomology algebras of\nthe various intersections of components of D, together with the restriction and Gysin maps\nbetween them. The same holds true (non-naturally) over Q ; see [18, Theorem 10.1].\nConsider now Y = F (X, n), where X is a smooth compact complex algebraic variety. In a\nseminal paper, Fulton and MacPherson [15] constructed a particularly nice compactification\nYe of this space, in the above sense. Applying Morgan's theory, they succeeded to describe\na DGA model for the Q-homotopy type of F (X, n), depending on n, H \u2217 (X; Q), and the\nChern classes of X. This model was algebraically simplified by K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [16], whose Q-model for\nF (X, n) depends only on n and the algebra H \u2217 (X; Q). To describe our models, we begin by\nintroducing a construction which abstracts the key features of the K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e model.\nLet A be a unital graded commutative algebra over a field K, m \u2265 1 a fixed number and\n\u2207 \u2208 A \u2297 A a degree 2m class which is graded symmetric:\n(1)\n\nT (\u2207) = \u2207,\n\nwhere T (a \u2297 b) := (\u22121)deg(a) deg(b) (b \u2297 a) is the graded flip, and which is 'diagonal' in the\nsense that\n(2)\n\n(a \u2297 1)\u2207 = (1 \u2297 a)\u2207,\n\nfor any a \u2208 A. For example, if A = H \u2217 (X; K), where X is an oriented 2m-dimensional real\nmanifold, then the diagonal class \u2207 \u2208 H 2m (X \u00d7 X; K) will satisfy (1) and (2) above. Given\na subset {i1 < . . . < ik } \u2282 {1, . . . , n}, denote by\n\u03b9i1 ,...,ik : A\u2297k \u0592\u2192 A\u2297n\nthe obvious inclusion that puts the s-th factor of A\u2297k into the is -th slot of A\u2297n . More\ngenerally, for an arbitrary, not necessarily linearly ordered subset {j1 , . . . , jk } \u2282 {1, . . . , n},\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n3\n\nthere is a unique permutation \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3k such that is := j\u03c3\u22121 (s) , 1 \u2264 s \u2264 k, is linearly ordered.\nWe will put\n\u03b9j1 ,...,jk := \u03b9i1 ,...,ik \u25e6 T\u03c3 ,\nwhere T\u03c3 : A\u2297k \u2192 A\u2297k is the canonical automorphism induced by \u03c3. Later in the paper we\nwill also need\n(3)\n\n\u03b9\u03c6 := \u03b9\u03c6(1),...,\u03c6(k) : A\u2297k \u0592\u2192 A\u2297n ,\n\nwhere \u03c6 : {1, . . . , k} \u2192 {1, . . . , n} is an injective map. Set \u2207ij := \u03b9ij (\u2207) \u2208 A\u2297n , for\n1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 n.\nDefinition 1. Let En (A, \u2207) be the free graded commutative A\u2297n -algebra A\u2297n [Gij ] with degree\n2m \u2212 1 exterior generators Gij , n \u2265 i > j \u2265 1, modulo the following relations:\n(4)\n(5)\n\nGij Gik = Gjk (Gik \u2212 Gij ), for n \u2265 i > j > k \u2265 1, and\n\u03b9i (x)Gij = \u03b9j (x)Gij , for x \u2208 A, n \u2265 i > j \u2265 1,\n\nwith the differential d given by d(\u03b9i (x)) := 0 for n \u2265 i \u2265 1 and dGij := \u2207ij for n \u2265 i > j \u2265 1.\nWe leave to the reader to verify that symmetry (1) guarantees the compatibility of d with\nrelations (4), while (2) is necessary for d to be compatible with (5).\nFrom now on, H will denote an arbitrary 2m-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 duality algebra over a\nfield K, with a distinguished orientation class \u03c9 \u2208 H 2m \\ {0}. Let \u2206 \u2208 H \u22972 be the class of\nthe diagonal,\nX\n\u2206 :=\n(\u22121)deg(h\u03b1 ) h\u03b1 \u2297 h\u2217\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\n\nwhere {h\u03b1 } is a homogeneous K-basis of H \u2217 , comprising 1, and {h\u2217\u03b1 } is the Poincar\u00e9 dual\nbasis with respect to \u03c9. The couple (H, \u2206) then clearly fulfills both (1) and (2). The K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017emodel En (H) is defined by En (H) := En (H, \u2206). When H = H \u2217 (X; K), where X is a closed\noriented real 2m-manifold, note also that (En (H), d) coincides with the DGA (E2m , d2m )\ncoming from the Cohen-Taylor spectral sequence for F (X, n); see [21].\nTheorem 2 (Fulton-MacPherson [15], K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e [16]). Let X be a smooth compact complex algebraic variety and H = H \u2217 (X; Q). Then the DGA (En (H), d) is a rational model, in the\nsense of Sullivan, of the configuration space F (X, n).\nLet (\u2206\n\u2206 n ) := (\u22062,1 , \u22063,1 , . . . , \u2206n,1 ) denote the ideal generated in H \u2297n by the diagonals\n\u22062,1 , \u22063,1 , . . . , \u2206n,1 . Let \u03c0 : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n ) be the projection and \uf6bei : H \u2192 H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n)\nthe composition \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b9i , n \u2265 i \u2265 1. Our first DGA model, Jn (H), is basically the K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model\nEn (H) with H \u2297n replaced by H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n ) and n \u2212 1 generators, Gn1 , Gn\u22121,1, . . . , G21 , missing:\nDefinition 3. The model Jn (H) is defined to be the free graded commutative H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n )algebra H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n )[Gij ] with degree 2m \u2212 1 exterior generators Gij , n \u2265 i > j \u2265 2, modulo\nthe relations:\nGij Gik = Gjk (Gik \u2212 Gij ), n \u2265 i > j > k \u2265 2, and\n\uf6bei (x)Gij = \uf6bej (x)Gij , for x \u2208 H, n \u2265 i > j \u2265 2.\n\n\f4\n\nB. BERCEANU, M. MARKL, AND \u015e. PAPADIMA\n\nThe differential is determined by d(\uf6bei (x)) := 0 for n \u2265 i \u2265 1 and dGij := \u03c0(\u2206ij ) for\nn \u2265 i > j \u2265 2.\nObserve that Jn (H) is not of the form En (A, \u2207), but it is very close to it. Though the\n'coefficients' H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n ) of Jn (H) seem more complicated than the coefficients H \u2297n of the\nK\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model, we will see, in Proposition 11, that the structure of H \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n ) is actually very\nsimple. The projection \u03c0 clearly generates an epimorphism \u03a8 : En (H) \u2192 Jn (H) of DGalgebras with \u03a8(Gij ) := Gij if n \u2265 i > j \u2265 2 and \u03a8(Gj1 ) := 0, n \u2265 j \u2265 2. Our first main\nresult in this paper, whose proof we postpone to Section 3, reads:\nTheorem 4. The natural map \u03a8 : En (H) \u2192 Jn (H) induces a cohomology isomorphism,\nfor an arbitrary even-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 duality algebra H. Therefore, Jn (H) is also a\nDGA model, in the sense of Sullivan, of the configuration space F (X, n), for X and H as in\nTheorem 2.\nLet H be an arbitrary even-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 duality algebra, as before. We are going\no\no\nto consider another associated DGA, to be denoted by En (H). To begin with, let H be the\no\nquotient algebra, H := H/K * \u03c9, that is,\n\u001a i\noi\nH , for 0 \u2264 i < 2m , and\nH =\n0,\nfor i \u2265 2m ,\nwith multiplication induced from H. Notice that, when H = H \u2217 (X; K), with X a closed\no\noriented real 2m-manifold, H is nothing else but the cohomology algebra of the non-compact\no\no\no \u22972\npunctured manifold X = X \\ pt. Denote by \u2206 the image of \u2206 in H . Plainly, conditions\no o\n(1) and (2) are satisfied by (H, \u2206).\nDefinition 5. The punctured K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model is the differential graded commutative algebra\no\no o\no\nEn (H) := En (H, \u2206), with differential denoted by d.\nThere is a very intimate relation between the J-model from Definition 3 and the punctured\nK\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model, which can be described as follows. Observe first that H is naturally augmented,\nvia an augmentation \u01eb : H \u2192 K, which makes K a right H-module. Observe also that\nthe map \u03b91 : H \u2192 H \u2297n induces a left differential (H, 0)-module structure on Jn (H). The\nfollowing useful fact will be proved in Section 3:\nProposition 6. For any n \u2265 1, there is an isomorphism of differential graded commutative\nalgebras\no\no\n(En\u22121 (H), d) \u223c\n= K \u2297(H,0) (Jn (H), d) .\nIn Section 4, we will derive from Theorem 4 and Proposition 6 the second main result of our\npaper, which may be viewed as an analog of the fundamental Theorem 2 in a non-compact\nsituation.\nTheorem 7. Let X be a 1-connected smooth compact complex algebraic variety. Set H =\no\no\nH \u2217 (X; C). Then the differential graded algebra (En (H), d) is a C-model, in the sense of\nSullivan, of the configuration space F (X \\ pt, n).\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n5\n\nOur proof entails a careful analysis of the natural fibration\no\n\np\n\nF (X, n \u2212 1) \u0592\u2192 F (X, n) \u2212\u2192 X \u220b pt.\nHere p is the projection onto the first coordinate, which is induced by an algebraic map\ndefined on the Fulton-MacPherson compactification of F (X, n), see [15]. A key step involves\nnaturality properties from Morgan's theory [18], which explains our need to use C instead\nof Q coefficients.\nThe strength of Theorem 7 is illustrated by Example 18: in the simplest case, corresponding\nto X = CP1 , we very easily recover the formality of the classifying space F (R2 , n) of the\npure braid group, as well as Arnold's description of its cohomology.\nThe rich geometry of configuration spaces of manifolds has a natural algebraic analogue,\nat the level of E-models. We will illustrate this principle in \u00a7 5. In Proposition 35, we endow\no\nthe collection {En (H)}n\u22650 with a simplicial structure, in the category of bigraded differential\nalgebras (DBGA's); this is based on Drinfel'd's [10] cosimplicial group structure on Artin\npure braid groups, and on the doubling operations on chord diagrams from the theory of\nVassiliev invariants of links [3]. We also define a coaction map, relating the cohomology of\no\nlittle cubes to {En (H)}n\u22650 , in Proposition 37. It should be pointed out that both abovementioned extra structures on DGA models exist only for punctured models; see Remarks 36\nand 38.\n2. Hints for applications\nThe algebra En (A, \u2207) introduced in Definition 1 is not free as a graded commutative\nalgebra, but it can be presented as a direct sum of free A\u2297n\u2212k -modules, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1. To\nformulate this statement more precisely, we need the following notation.\nFor a sequence 1 \u2264 i1 < * * * < ik \u2264 n, let 1 \u2264 h1 < * * * < hn\u2212k \u2264 n be its 'complement',\nthat is, a sequence such that {i1 , . . . , ik , h1 , . . . , hn\u2212k } = {1, . . . , n}. Set\n\u03b9ci1 ,...,ik := \u0131h1 ,...,hn\u2212k : A\u2297n\u2212k \u2192 A\u2297n .\nThe following statement is Proposition 2.1 of [5].\nProposition 8 (Bezrukavnikov [5]). The linear map\nM M\nA\u2297n\u2212k * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk \u2212\u2192 En (A),\n(6)\n\u039e:\n0\u2264k\u2264n\u22121 Ik\n\nwhere Ik := {2 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < ik \u2264 n, i1 > j1 \u2265 1, . . . , ik > jk \u2265 1}, given by\n\u039e(h * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk ) := \u03b9ci1 ,...,ik (h) * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk ,\nis an isomorphism of graded vector spaces.\nLet now H be an even-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 duality algebra over a field K. The direct\nsum (6) with the induced differential can be therefore understood as an alternative descripo\no o\ntion of En (H) or En (H) (depending on whether (A, \u2207) is (H, \u2206) or (H, \u2206)), accessible by\nmethods of linear algebra.\n\n\f6\n\nB.

The linear map\nM M\nH \u2297n\u2212k /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u2212k ) * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk \u2212\u2192 Jn (H),\n(7)\n\u03a5:\n0\u2264k\u2264n\u22122 Jk\n\nwhere Jk := {3 \u2264 i1 < i2 < * * * < ik \u2264 n, i1 > j1 \u2265 2, . . . , ik > jk \u2265 2}, given by\n\u03a5(h * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk ) := \uf6beci1 ,...,ik (h) * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gik jk\nis an isomorphism of graded vector spaces. In the above display, \uf6beci1 ,...,ik : H \u2297n\u2212k /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u2212k ) \u2192\nH \u2297n /(\u2206\n\u2206 n ) is the map induced by \u03b9ci1 ,...,ik .\nThe left hand side of (7) provides an alternative description of Jn (H) as a direct sum of\nfree H \u2297n\u2212k /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u2212k )-modules. From this perspective, the following proposition (to be proved\nin Section 3) is very useful.\nProposition 11. The composition\no\n\n\u03c0\n\nH \u2297 H \u2297l \u2212 1 \u0592\u2192 H \u2297l \u2192 H \u2297l /(\u2206\n\u2206 l)\ninduces, for any l \u2265 2, an isomorphism of graded left H-modules, where H acts on the first\no\nposition on both H \u2297 H \u2297l \u2212 1 and H \u2297l .\no\n\nRemark 12. Note that all three models, En (H), En (H) and Jn (H), are actually bigraded\ndifferential algebras (DBGA's). The second (exterior ) degree is given by the number of\nGij -factors, and the differentials are homogeneous, of bidegree (+1, \u22121). In particular,\nM\nH \u2217 F (X, n) =\nH p,q F (X, n) ,\np,q\u22650\n\nwhere p denotes the usual degree and q is the exterior degree (when Theorem 4 applies),\no\nand similarly for X (when Theorem 7 applies). We can thus define the bigraded Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial\nX\nPF (X,n) (s, t) :=\ndim H p,q F (X, n)sq tp .\np,q\u22650\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n7\n\nThe ordinary Poincar\u00e9 polynomial is then the specialization PF (X,n) (t) := PF (X,n) (1, t), and\no\nlikewise for X.\nIn Examples 13\u201317, X is as in Theorem 4, and H = H \u2217 (X; Q).\nExample 13. Let us begin with the simple case of two points (where various methods can\nbe used). Here J2 (H) is just H \u22972/(\u2206) with trivial differential, therefore F (X, 2) is a formal\nspace, and\nH \u2217 (F (X, 2); Q) = H \u22972 /(\u2206).\nBy Proposition 11, the algebras in the above display are isomorphic, as graded veco\ntor spaces, to H \u2297 H, therefore the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PF (X,2) (s, t) of F (X, 2) equals\nPX (t)(PX (t) \u2212 t2m ).\nExample 14. For three points, the model J3 (H) reduces to the 2-term complex\nd\n\nH \u22973 /(\u220631 , \u220621 ) \u2190\u2212 \u21912m\u22121 H \u22972 /(\u220621 ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u21912m\u22121 denotes the suspension iterated 2m \u2212 1 times and the differential d is given by\nd(h1 \u2297 h2 ) = (\u22121)deg(h1 )+deg(h2 ) (h1 \u2297 h2 \u2297 1) * \u220632 , for h1 \u2297 h2 \u2208 H \u22972 .\nThis economical description should be compared with the full K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model for F (X, 3) described in Example 9. Using Proposition 11, we can simplify this complex further to\no\n\nd\n\no\n\nH \u2297 H \u22972 \u2190\u2212 \u21912m\u22121 H \u2297 H,\nwhere d is now given by\nd(h \u2297 l) = (\u22121)deg(h)+deg(l) [(h \u2297 l \u2297 1)\u220632 \u2212 (h \u2297 1 \u2297 l)\u220621 \u2212(\u22121)deg(h) deg(l) (1 \u2297 l \u2297 h)\u220631 ],\no\n\no\n\nfor h \u2297 l \u2208 H \u2297 H. As an exercise, check that d(h \u2297 l) indeed belongs to H \u2297 H \u22972 . Notice\nalso that the complex (8) can be used to compute the full ring structure of the cohomology\nof F (X, 3), not only its Betti numbers.\nExample 15. Let a, b, c and d be generators of degree 1 and V a two-dimensional graded\nvector space concentrated in degree 2 considered as a non-unital algebra with trivial multiplication. Let \u2227(\u2212) denote the free graded commutative associative algebra functor. Then\nthe rational cohomology algebra of the configuration space F (T, 3) of three points in the\ntwo-dimensional torus T is isomorphic to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2227(a, b, c, d)\n\u2295 V \u2297 H \u2217 (T ; Q).\n(ab = cd = 0, ac = bd)\nThe bigraded Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PF (T,3) (s, t) is\n(1 + 4t + 3t2 + 2st2 ) * PT (t) = 1 + 6t + (12 + 2s)t2 + (10 + 4s)t3 + (3 + 2s)t4\nand the ordinary Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PF (T,3) (t) equals\n(1 + 4t + 5t2 ) * PT (t) = 1 + 6t + 14t2 + 14t3 + 5t4 .\n\n\f8\n\nB.

One may use the J-model to compute the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of F (S 2 , n),\n\u22122\u03c9\nfor arbitrary n, in the following simple way. Start with n = 3, J3 (H) : H \u2190\u2212 \u2191 H to obtain\nH \u2217 (F (S 2 , 3)) = \u2227(x3 ), where x3 is a degree 3 generator, with bigraded Poincar\u00e9 polynomial\nPF (S 2 ,3) (s, t) = 1 + st3 .

The induction is based on the following easy argument. Filter Jn (H) by F0 = Jn\u22121 (H), F1 = Jn (H);\nin the corresponding spectral sequence E = (En , dn ) we obtain\n(E0 , d0) = (Jn\u22121 (H), d) \u2297 (Span Q (1, Gn2, . . . , Gn,n\u22121), 0) ,\n(E1 , d1) = (H \u2217 (Jn\u22121 ) \u2297 (Span Q (1, Gn2, . . . , Gn,n\u22121)), 0) ,\nand then E collapses, due to an obvious degree argument.\nIn Examples 18-21, X is as in Theorem 7, and H = H \u2217 (X; C).\no\n\no\n\nExample 18. Applying Theorem 7 to X = CP1 , for which H = C * 1, and d = 0, we\nrecover another classical result: the pure braid space F (R2 , n) is formal, with cohomology\nring described by the Arnold relations (4), and bigraded Poincar\u00e9 polynomial given by\nPF (R2 ,n) (s, t) = (1 + st)(1 + 2st) * * * [1 + (n \u2212 1)st],\nfor all n; see [1], and also [19].\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n9\n\no\n\nExample 19.

By construction, the differential tensor product K \u2297(H,0) (Jn (H), d)\nis obtained from the DGA (En (H), d), by first killing Gi1 and dGi1 = \u2206i1 , for n \u2265 i > 1,\nand then also killing \u03b91 (h), for h \u2208 H + . It is now easy to check that one obtains in this way\no\no\na DGA isomorphic to (En\u22121 (H), d).\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 11. Let us show first that the composition\n(12)\n\no\n\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\nH \u2297 H \u2297l \u2212 1 \u0592\u2192 H \u2297l \u2212\u2192 H \u2297l /(\u2206\n\u2206 l)\no\n\nis an epimorphism. To this end, define the filtration {Fk := H \u2297k \u2297 H \u2297l \u2212 k }1\u2264k\u2264l of H \u2297l and\nprove, by induction on k, that Im(\u03c0i) contains \u03c0(Fk ) for each 1 \u2264 k \u2264 l. Because Fl = H \u2297l ,\nthis would imply the statement.\nBecause F1 = Im(i), Im(\u03c0i) contains \u03c0(F1 ). Suppose that we have already proved that\nIm(\u03c0i) \u2283 \u03c0(Fk\u22121 ), for some 2 \u2264 k < l, and let h \u2208 Fk \\ Fk\u22121 . We may clearly assume,\nwithout loss of generality, that\n(13)\n\nh = h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hk\u22121 \u2297 \u03c9 \u2297 hk+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hl .\n\nNote then that\n(14)\n\nh\u2032 := h \u2212 \u2206k1 (h1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 hl ) \u2208 Fk\u22121 .\n\nSince by definition \u03c0(h) = \u03c0(h\u2032 ), the induction gives \u03c0(h) \u2208 Im(\u03c0i), therefore Im(\u03c0i) \u2283\n\u03c0(Fk ).\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n11\n\nLet us prove that the composition (12) is monic. Suppose therefore that h \u2208 Ker(\u03c0i),\nthat is\nX\nh=\nh1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 hl \u2208 F1 \u2229 (\u2206\n\u2206 l ) = Im(i) \u2229 (\u2206\n\u2206 l)\nand prove that then h actually equals 0. Clearly h must be of the form\nX (s)\nX\n(s)\n(15)\nh=\n\u2206s1 * (\n\u03c61 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6l ) ,\n1<s\u2264l\n\nP\n\n(s)\n\u03c61\n\n(s)\n\nfor some \u03a6(s) :=\n\u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6l \u2208 H \u2297l . We infer from (13) and (14) that \u2206s1 * Fk \u2282\n\u2206s1 * Fk\u22121 + \u2206k1 * Fk , whenever l \u2265 k > s > 1, thus we can assume that \u03a6(s) \u2208 Fs for\n1 < s \u2264 l.\nThe last possibly nonzero term of (15), say \u2206q1 *\u03a6(q) , equals, by property (2) of the diagonal,\n(16)\n\n\u2206q1 * (\n\nX\n\n(q)\n\n(q)\n\n(q)\n\n(q)\n\n\u01eb * \u03c61 \u03c6(q)\nq \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6q\u22121 \u2297 1 \u2297 \u03c6q+1 . . . \u2297 \u03c6l ),\n\nwhere \u01eb is an appropriate sign, and it is zero mod Fq\u22121 , by assumption. At the same time,\nP\n(q) (q)\n(q)\nthe sum from (16) equals, mod Fq\u22121 ,\n\u01eb * \u03c61 \u03c6q \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c9 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6l , since \u03a6(q) \u2208 Fq .\nP\n(q) (q)\n(q)\nWe conclude that\n\u01eb * \u03c61 \u03c6q \u2297 . . . \u2297 1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c6l = 0, which implies \u2206q1 * \u03a6(q) = 0. The\nproposition is proved.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 4. We will work with the K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model presented as the direct sum in (6).\nThe main trick is to write En (H) as a bicomplex. Put\nM\nn\nEpq\n:=\nH \u2297n\u2212(p+q) * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gip+q jp+q ,\n\nwith the sum running over i1 , j1 , . . . , ip+q , jp+q \u2208 Ip+q as in (6) such that card{s; js = 1} = q.\nThen\nM\nn\nEn (H) =\nEpq\n0\u2264p+q\u2264n\u22121\n\nand the differential d clearly splits as d = d1 + d2 , where\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd1 : Epq\n\u2192 Ep,q\u22121\nand d2 : Epq\n\u2192 Ep\u22121,q\n.\n\nLet us agree for the rest of this proof to understand by degree the bicomplex degree, that is,\nn\nelements of Epq\nhave degree p + q.\nExample 22. The K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e-model E3 (H) for three points, described explicitly in Example 9,\ncan be organized into a bicomplex whose nontrivial part is:\nd2\n\nH * G21 G31 \u271b\nd1\n\nd1\n\n\u2744\n\nd2\n\nH \u22972 * G21 \u2295 H \u22972 * G31 \u271b\nd1\n\u2744\n\nH \u22973\n\n0\n\u2744\n\nH * G21 G32\nd1\n\n\u271b\n\nd2\n\n\u2744\n\nH \u22972 * G32\n\n\f12\n\nB. BERCEANU, M. MARKL, AND \u015e. PAPADIMA\n\nTheorem 4 will follow from the following statement.\nn\nLemma 23. The columns of the bicomplex (Epq\n, d) are acyclic in positive q-degrees. The only\nnontrivial homology of the p-th column is\nM\nn\nH \u2297n\u2212p /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u2212p ) * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gip jp ,\n(17)\nH0 (Ep\u2217\n, d1 ) \u223c\n=\nJp\n\nwhere Jp was introduced in Proposition 10.\nAssuming Lemma 23, Theorem 4 immediately follows from the observation that Jn (H) in\npresentation (7) is the second term of the obvious spectral sequence related to the bicomplex\nn\n(Epq\n, d1 + d2 ) and that this sequence is concentrated on the line q = 0. It remains to prove\nLemma 23.\nSince formula (17) for the 0-th homology is obvious, we need only to prove the acyclicity\nin positive degrees. This will be done in two steps.\nn\nn\nStep (1) Let T\u2217n be the extreme left column E0\u2217\nof E\u2217\u2217\n. We show that all remaining\nn\ns\ncolumns Ep\u2217 , p \u2265 1, are combinations of complexes T\u2217 with s < n. So it is enough to prove\nonly the acyclicity of T\u2217n , for all n \u2265 1.\n\nStep (2) To prove the acyclicity of T\u2217n , we observe that T\u2217n decomposes into the direct\nsum of two copies of T\u2217n\u22121 . Using this we reduce the proof of the acyclicity of T\u2217n to the\nverification that a certain very explicit map is monic.\nLet us start with Step (1). For n \u2265 1 we denote\nn\n(T\u2217n , d) := (E0\u2217\n, d1).\nn\nClaim 24. For any p \u2265 1, the column (Ep\u2217\n, d1 ) decomposes as\nM\nM n\u2212p\nn\n(T\u2217n\u2212p , d),\n(E0\u2217 * Gi1 j1 Gi2 j2 * * * Gip jp , d1 ) \u223c\n(Ep\u2217\n, d1 ) =\n= \u2191p(2m\u22121)\nJp\n\nJp\n\nwhere Jp was defined in Proposition 10.\nThe claim is obvious, because the differential d1 by definition does not affect generators\nGij with j \u2265 2.\nExample 25. The complex (T\u22171 , d) is just H with trivial differential. The complex (T\u22172 , d) is\nd\n\nH \u22972 \u2190\u2212 H * G21 ,\nwith d given by the multiplication with \u220621 . We see that the right column of the bicomplex\n3\nE\u2217\u2217\ndescribed in Example 22 is isomorphic to\n(T\u22172 , d) * G32 \u223c\n= \u21912m\u22121 (T\u22172 , d),\nas predicted by Claim 24.\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n13\n\nLet us move to Step (2), that is, prove that the complexes (T\u2217n , d), n \u2265 1, are acyclic in\npositive degrees. It follows from the definition that, for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1,\nM\nTkn =\nH \u2297n\u2212k * Gi1 1 Gi2 1 * * * Gik 1 ,\n\nwhere the summation runs over all i1 , . . . , ik with 2 \u2264 i1 < i2 * * * < ik \u2264 n.\nn\nn\nn\nn \u223c\n\u2295 T1\u2217\n, with T0q\nconsisting of\nClearly T\u2217n splits into a two-column bicomplex T\u2217\u2217\n= T0\u2217\nsummands\nH \u2297n\u2212q * Gi1 1 Gi2 1 * * * Giq 1\nn\nwith iq < n and T1q\nconsisting of summands\n\nH \u2297n\u2212(q+1) * Gi1 1 Gi2 1 * * * Giq+1 1\nn\nof T1+q\nwith iq+1 = n. The differential d obviously decomposes as d = d1 + d2 , where\nn\nn\nn\nn\nd1 : Tpq\n\u2192 Tp,q\u22121\nand d2 : Tpq\n\u2192 Tp\u22121,q\n.\n\nThe following claim is evident, see also Example 27.\nClaim 26. One has the following isomorphisms of complexes:\nn\nn\n, d1 ) \u223c\n(T0\u2217\n, d1 ) \u223c\n= \u21912m\u22121 (T\u2217n\u22121, d).\n= (T\u2217n\u22121, d) \u2297 (H, d = 0) and (T1\u2217\n\nExample 27.

The right column is T\u22173 * G41 , that is, \u21912m\u22121 T\u22173 . These observations\nare in a perfect harmony with Claim 26.\nAssuming inductively that (T\u2217n\u22121 , d) is acyclic in positive dimensions, the cohomology of\n(T\u2217n , d) reduces to the cohomology of a two-term complex\nH0 (T\u2217n\u22121 , d) \u2297 H \u2190\u2212 \u21912m\u22121 H0 (T\u2217n\u22121 , d)\nwith the differential induced by d2 . The above map can be easily identified with\nH \u2297n\u22121 /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 ) \u2297 H \u2190\u2212 \u21912m\u22121 H \u2297n\u22121 /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 )\nwhere the differential is given by the multiplication with \u2206n1 .

The map\nH \u2297n\u22121/(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 H \u2297n\u22121 /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 ) \u2297 H\nsending [\u03b1] \u2208 H \u2297n\u22121 /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 ) to (\u03c0 \u2297 id)((\u03b1 \u2297 1)\u2206n1 ) \u2208 H \u2297n\u22121 /(\u2206\n\u2206 n\u22121 ) \u2297 H is a monomorphism.\nThe proof of the claim is simple. Suppose that \u03b1 is homogeneous of degree s. The only\nterm in (\u03b1 \u2297 1)\u2206n1 of bidegree (s, 2m) is \u03b1 \u2297 \u03c9, where \u03c9 \u2208 H 2m is the fundamental class.\nTherefore (\u03c0 \u2297id)((\u03b1\u22971)\u2206n1 ) = 0 if and only if [\u03b1] = 0. This finishes the proof of Lemma 23\nand thus also the proof of Theorem 4.\n\u0003\n4. Configuration spaces of punctured manifolds\nThis section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 7. The bridge between topology and algebra\nis provided by the natural fibration\n(18)\n\no\n\np\n\nF (X, n \u2212 1) \u0592\u2192 F (X, n) \u2212\u2192 X \u220b pt,\n\nwhere p is the projection onto the first coordinate. When X is as in our theorem, (18) above\nis a fibration of connected spaces, having a 1-connected base with finite Betti numbers.\nTherefore, the approach initiated by J.C. Moore, to get cochain algebra models for the fiber\nvia differential homological algebra, may be used, in the particularly convenient form of the\nso-called semifree resolutions introduced by F\u00e9lix-Halperin-Thomas in [12].\nParts of the theory used below work for arbitrary field coefficients (e.g., the connection\nbetween semifree resolutions and fibrations), some other parts (e.g., the theory of Sullivan\nrelative models for fibrations) require characteristic zero field coefficients, while Morgan's theory of bigraded models for smooth complex varieties from [18, Section 9] needs C-coefficients.\nTo simplify matters, we will thus work over C, throughout this section.\n4.1. Semifree resolutions, relative models, and fibrations. We start by recalling some\nrelevant facts from [12]. From now on, all DGA's (A, dA ) will be tacitly assumed to be\nf\nhomologically connected, that is, H 0 (A, dA ) = C. Given a DGA map, (B, dB ) \u2212\u2192 (E, dE ),\nwe will assume in \u00a7 4.1 that H 1 f is monic. The examples we have in mind are\n(19)\n\n\u03a9\u2217 (p)\n\ndR\n\u03a9\u2217dR (F (X, n)),\n\u03a9\u2217dR (X) \u2212\u2192\n\ncoming from the basic fibration (18), via the C \u221e de Rham DGA functor with complex\ncoefficients, \u03a9\u2217dR (*). The following definition is taken from [12, \u00a7 6].\nDefinition 29. A DGA (B, dB ) is called semifree over (B, dB ) if there exists a graded vector\nspace Z \u2217 with the following properties:\n(i) B\u2217 = B \u2217 \u2297 Z \u2217 , as graded vector spaces,\nL\n(ii) the graded vector space Z \u2217 admits a second grading, Z \u2217 = k\u22650 Zk\u2217 , such that Z0\u2217 = C\nand (B \u2297 Z0 , dB ) = (B, dB ) as DGA's,\n(iii) the product of B satisfies b \u2297 z = (b \u2297 1) * (1 \u2297 z), for b \u2208 B and z \u2208 Z,\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n15\n\n(iv) all subspaces B \u2297 Z\u2264k are dB -invariant, and, finally\n(v) for k > 0, the quotient cochain complexes are of the form\n(B \u2297 Z\u2264k /B \u2297 Z<k , dB ) = (B, dB ) \u2297 (Zk , 0) .\n\u03c1\n\nA DGA map (B, dB ) \u2212\u2192 (E, dE ), is said to be a semifree resolution of f : (B, dB ) \u2192 (E, dE )\nif (B, dB ) is semifree over (B, dB ), the restriction of \u03c1 to (B \u2297 Z0 , dB ) \u2261 (B, dB ) equals f ,\nand H \u2217 \u03c1 is an isomorphism.\nThe main source of semifree resolutions is provided by Sullivan relative models of f . That\nL\nk\nis, by DGA's of the form (B, dB ) = (B \u2297 \u2227W \u2217 , dB ), where W \u2217 =\nk>0 W , and the dif\u03c1\nferential dB satisfies a certain nilpotence condition, together with a DGA map, (B, dB ) \u2212\u2192\n(E, dE ), which restricts to f on B and induces a homology isomorphism. If H 1 f is monic,\nthen f has such a relative model, which is a semifree resolution, in the sense of Definition 29.\nSee [12, Proposition 14.3 and Lemma 14.1].\nAssume now that B is augmented, by a DGA map \u03b5 : (B, dB ) \u2192 C. In the geometric\ncase from (19), B \u2217 = \u03a9\u2217dR (X) and the augmentation comes from the inclusion, pt \u0592\u2192 X, via\n\u03a9\u2217dR (*). Moore's basic result which relates topology to algebra says that the DGA\n(20)\n\n(\u2227W, d) := C \u2297(B,dB ) (B, dB )\no\n\nis a Sullivan model of the fiber, F (X, n \u2212 1), for any relative model, (B, dB ), of the DGA\nmap \u03a9\u2217dR (p) from (19). Here, C is to be considered as a right (B, dB )-module, via \u03b5, and\n(B, dB ) as a left (B, dB )-module, via the inclusion (B, dB ) \u0592\u2192 (B, dB ). See [12, Theorem 15.3\nand Theorem 7.10]. Note also that this is the only place where we need the 1-connectivity\nassumption on X.\n4.2. Algebraic weak homotopy type and homotopy fiber. Our strategy for proving\nTheorem 7 is to use the differential tensor product construction from (20) to arrive at the\no\nDGA model of F (X, n\u22121) from our theorem. We are thus led to study how this construction\ndepends on its input, that is, on the DGA map \u03a9\u2217dR (p). The next definition comes in\nnaturally.\nDefinition 30. Let f : B \u2192 E and f \u2032 : B \u2032 \u2192 E \u2032 be DGA maps, with B and B \u2032 augmented.\nAn elementary weak equivalence, f \u2192 f \u2032 , consists of a DGA map, \u03a6 : E \u2192 E \u2032 , and an\naugmented DGA map, \u03c6 : B \u2192 B \u2032 , such that both H \u2217 \u03a6 and H \u2217 \u03c6 are isomorphisms, and\nsuch that \u03a6f and f \u2032 \u03c6 are Sullivan homotopic DGA maps (notation: \u03a6f \u2243 f \u2032 \u03c6):\n\u03a6\n\u2732 E\u2032\nE\nf\n\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\nf\u2032\n\nH\n\u2732\n\nB\n\u2769\n\u2769\n\u03b5\u2769\n7\n\u2769\n\n\u03c6\nC\n\n\u271a\n\u271a\u2032\n\u03b5\n\u271a\n\u2742\n\u271a\n\nB\u2032\n\n\f16\n\nB.

PAPADIMA\n\nWe say that f and f \u2032 have the same weak homotopy type (notation: f \u223c\n= f \u2032 ) if there\nis a chain of DGA maps, {fi : Bi \u2192 Ei }0\u2264i\u2264l , as above, together with elementary weak\nequivalences, fi \u2192 fi+1 or fi \u2190 fi+1 , such that f0 = f and fl = f \u2032 .\nLemma 31. Assume f \u223c\n= f \u2032 , in the sense of the above definition, where H 1 f (and consequently also H 1 f \u2032 ) are monic. Let \u03c1 : B = (B\u2297\u2227W, dB ) \u2192 E and \u03c1\u2032 : B\u2032 = (B \u2032 \u2297\u2227W \u2032 , dB\u2032 ) \u2192\nE \u2032 be arbitrary relative models, for f and f \u2032 respectively. Then the DGA's C \u2297(B,dB ) (B, dB )\nand C \u2297(B\u2032 ,dB\u2032 ) (B\u2032 , dB\u2032 ) have the same Sullivan minimal model.\nProof. Plainly, it is enough to treat the case of an elementary weak equivalence, say, f \u2192\nf \u2032 . Suppose first that it is strict , that is, \u03a6f = f \u2032 \u03c6 (not only equality up to algebraic\nhomotopy). Consider the pushout construction from [12, \u00a7 14(a)]. It provides a DGA map,\n\u03c6 \u2297 id : B = (B \u2297 \u2227W, dB ) \u2192 (B \u2032 \u2297 \u2227W, d\u2032\u2032 ) =: \u03c6\u2217 B, extending \u03c6 and inducing a homology\nisomorphism; see [12, Lemma 14.2].\nDefine a DGA map, \u03c6\u2217 \u03c1 : \u03c6\u2217 B \u2192 E \u2032 , which extends f \u2032 , by setting \u03c6\u2217 \u03c1 := \u03a6\u03c1, on W . By\nconstruction, \u03c6\u2217 \u03c1 is a relative model of f \u2032 (see [12, \u00a7 14(a)]). By [12, Theorem 6.10(ii)], C\u2297B B\nand C \u2297B\u2032 \u03c6\u2217 B have the same minimal model. At the same time ([12, Proposition 14.6]),\nthere is a DGA map, \u03a8 : B\u2032 \u2192 \u03c6\u2217 B, extending the identity on B \u2032 and such that \u03c6\u2217 \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03a8 \u2243 \u03c1\u2032 .\nIt follows that \u03a8 induces an isomorphism on homology; hence, by [12, Proposition 6.7(ii)],\nC \u2297B\u2032 B\u2032 and C \u2297B\u2032 \u03c6\u2217 B have the same minimal model. This settles the strict case.\nIn the general case, the property \u03a6f \u2243 f \u2032 \u03c6 means the existence of a DGA map, H : B \u2192\nE \u2032 \u2297 \u2227(t, dt), such that e0 H = \u03a6f and e1 H = f \u2032 \u03c6, where ei : E \u2032 \u2297 \u2227(t, dt) \u2192 E \u2032 are the\nDGA maps extending idE \u2032 , which send t to i and dt to 0, for i = 0, 1.\nPick a relative model of H, \u03b7 : C = (B \u2297 \u2227T, dC ) \u2192 E \u2032 \u2297 \u2227(t, dt). Since both e0 and e1\ninduce homology isomorphisms [12, Lemma 12.5], e0 \u03b7 is a relative model of \u03a6f , and e1 \u03b7 is\na relative model of f \u2032 \u03c6. We may now use the strict case to infer that C \u2297B B, C \u2297B\u2032 B\u2032 and\nC \u2297B C have the same minimal model.\n\u0003\nWe may rephrase Lemma 31 in the following way. Given a DGA map, f : B \u2192 E, with\nH 1 f monic, we may define its homotopy fiber, F (f ), to be the minimal model of C \u2297B B,\nwhere B is any relative model of f . If f \u223c\n= f \u2032 , then F (f ) = F (f \u2032 ). In particular, if \u03a9\u2217dR (p)\nfrom (19) has the same weak homotopy type as f , then C \u2297B B will be a (not necessarily\no\nminimal) model of F (X, n \u2212 1), according to our discussion from the end of \u00a7 4.1. Recall\nthat H denotes the cohomology algebra H \u2217 (X; C).\nLemma 32. Let \u03b91 : (E1 (H), d) = (H, 0) \u2192 (En (H), d) be the DGA map induced by the map\n\u03b91 : H \u2192 H \u2297n described in Section 1, canonically augmented by \u03b5(h) = 0, for h \u2208 H + , and\no\no\n\u03b5(1) = 1. Then F (\u03b91 ) is the minimal model of (En\u22121 (H), d).\nProof. According to Theorem 4 and Lemma 31, F (\u03b91 ) = F (\u03a8 \u25e6 \u03b91 ). We claim now that\n(Jn (H), d) is (H, 0)-semifree. Indeed, Propositions 10 and 11 together imply that we may\ntake\nM o \u2297n\u2212k\u22121\nH\n* G i1 j 1 * * * G ik j k ,\nZk+1 :=\nJk\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n17\n\no \u2297n\u22121\n\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 2, Z1 := (H\n)+ and Z0 := C * 1. To check the last semifreeness condition\nfrom Definition 29, it suffices to recall from Remark 12 that d is homogeneous of degree \u22121,\nwith respect to exterior degree.\nLet \u03c1 : B \u2192 Jn (H) be a relative model of \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03b91 . It follows that both \u03c1 : B \u2192 Jn (H) and\nidJn (H) are semifree resolutions of \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03b91 . Therefore, C \u2297H B and C \u2297H Jn (H) have the same\nminimal model, by [12, Proposition 6.7(ii)]. To finish the proof of our lemma, it is enough\no\nto recall from Proposition 6 that the DGA C \u2297H Jn (H) is isomorphic to En\u22121 (H).\n\u0003\n4.3. Replacing forms by E-models. Let X be a smooth compact, complex algebraic\nvariety. Set H = H \u2217 (X; C). We know, from [18] and [15, 16] respectively, that (H, 0)\nmodels \u03a9\u2217dR (X) (the formality property), and (En (H), d) models the de Rham DG-algebra\n\u03a9\u2217dR (F (X, n)). The next proposition links these two things, into the form of a statement\nabout DGA maps. By Lemma 32 and the discussion preceding it, this statement implies\nTheorem 7.\nProposition 33. The DGA map \u03a9\u2217dR (p) : \u03a9\u2217dR (X) \u2192 \u03a9\u2217dR (F (X, n)) has the same weak\nhomotopy type as \u03b91 : E1 (H) \u2192 En (H).\nThe main step in the proof uses Morgan's results from [18], so we recall his basic constructions. For Y = Ye \\ D, a complement of a divisor with normal crossings in a smooth\ncompact complex algebraic variety, Morgan introduced a filtered model, MY (denoted by\nEC \u221e (Y )C in [18, \u00a72]), a DG-algebra of global sections of a sheaf related to D. If Y = Ye ,\nMY = \u03a9\u2217dR (Y ). In general, there is a DGA map,\n\u03a8\n\nY\nMY ,\n\u03a9\u2217dR (Y ) \u2190\u2212\n\ninducing an isomorphism in homology; see [18, \u00a7 \u00a7 2-3].\nMoreover, MY is provided with an increasing filtration W\u2217 induced by the stratification of\nD, and also with the associated increasing filtration, Dec W\u2217 , defined in [18, \u00a71]. Morgan's\nsecond construction is the bigraded minimal model, NY , of the filtered model MY . There is\na DGA map,\nM\n\u03a6Y\nNY =\nN n \u2212\u2192\nMY ,\nn\u22650\n\ninducing an isomorphism in homology. Moreover, each homogeneous component is bigraded:\nL\nN n = r,s\u2208N N n;r,s, N 0 = N 0;0,0 = C * 1; the differential and the multiplication are homogeneous, of bidegree (0, 0), with respect to the above extra bigrading of NY . Finally, the\nbigrading of NY and the filtration of MY are related by:\n(21)\n\n\u03a6(N n;r,s) \u2282 Dec Wr+s (Mn )\n\n(see [18, \u00a7 6], in particular (6.0) and Theorem 6.6).\nUsing mixed Hodge diagrams [18, Definition 3.5] and mixed Hodge homotopies [18, \u00a7 6.1],\nMorgan proved the naturality of these two constructions.

See Definitions 3.5 and 3.7, and Propositions 3.6 and 3.9 of [18], for the left square from (22); to construct the right square from (22),\nuse Theorem 6.7 and Corollary 6.8 of [18].\nBy construction, MY is a Sullivan model of Y . Let us now consider the decreasing DGA\nfiltration of MY , W \u2217 := W\u2212\u2217 , and the associated spectral sequence of DGA's,\n( W E\u2217r (MY ), dr )r\u22650 =\u21d2 H \u2217 (MY ) .\nA basic result in Morgan's theory ([18, Theorem 9.6]) says that the DGA ( W E1 (MY ), d1 )\nis also a model of Y . We need the following relative version of this result, where W E1 (Mf )\ndenotes the DGA map between W E1 \u2013terms induced by the filtered DGA map Mf .\ne Z) is an algebraic map, then the DGA map\nProposition 34.

Define decreasing DGA filtrations, on both (NY , d) and (NZ , d), by : W k (N n ) :=\nL\nn;r,s\n.

Directly\nfrom Definition 30, we deduce from the above diagram elementary weak equivalences,\nM f \u2190 Nf \u2261\n\nW E1 (Nf )\n\n\u2192\n\nW E1 (Mf ) ,\n\nand we are done.\nGoing back to our commutativity claim, let us start by noting that K is a filtered DGA\nmap; see (23). We thus get an induced DGA map,\nW E0 (K)\n\n: ( W E0 (NZ ), d0 ) \u2192 ( W E0 (MY \u2297 \u2227(t, dt)), d0) \u2261 ( W E0 (MY ), d0 ) \u2297 \u2227(t, dt).\n\nWe thus obtain from the second square of (22) a homotopy commutative DGA square (the\nleft diagram of the following display), and, for the next level of spectral sequences, a strictly\ncommutative one (the right diagram below):\nW E0 (\u03a6Y\n\n( W E0 (NY ), d0 )\nW E0 (Nf )\n\n\u273b\n\n)\n\n\u2732 ( W E0 (MY ), d0 )\n\nW E0 (K)\n\n( W E0 (NZ ), d0 )\n\n\u273b\n\nW E0 (Mf )\n\n\u2732 ( W E0 (MZ ), d0 )\n\nW E1 (\u03a6Y\n\n( W E1 (NY ), d1 )\nW E1 (Nf )\n\n)\n\n\u2732 ( W E1 (MY ), d1 )\n\n\u273b\n\n( W E1 (NZ ), d1 )\n\nW E0 (\u03a6Z )\n\n\u273b\n\nW E1 (Mf )\n\n\u2732 ( W E1 (MZ ), d1 )\nW E1 (\u03a6Z )\n\nThis verifies our claim and thus ends the proof of Proposition 34.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Proposition 33. We put together a sequence of elementary weak equivalences coming\nfrom [18], [15], and [16].\nApplying (22) (the left square) and Proposition 34 to the projection onto the first coordinate p : (X[n], F (X, n)) \u2192 (X, X) (where X[n] is the compactification in [15]), we obtain a\nweak homotopy equivalence \u03a9\u2217dR (p) \u223c\n= W E1 (Mp ).\nThe last two elementary equivalences are described in the next diagram:\n\n\f20\n\nB.

The DGA isomorphism \u03bcn is constructed in [15, \u00a76]. The DGA's A\u2217 (X, 1)C and\n\u2217\nW E1 (MX ) are both equal to (H, 0), and \u03bc1 = id. The DGA A (X, n)C is a quotient of\na certain free graded H \u2297n -algebra, and the DGA map \u03b9A\n1 between A-models is induced by\n\u2297n\n\u03b91 : H \u2192 H , like in the case of E-models. An easy analysis of the construction of \u03bcn shows\nthat the above left DGA square is commutative, and therefore provides an elementary weak\nequivalence, W E1 (Mp ) \u2192 \u03b9A\n1.\nThe DGA map \u03ban , constructed by K\u0159\u0131\u0301\u017e in [16, \u00a73], induces an isomorphism in homology;\nsee [16, \u00a74]. By construction, \u03ban is H \u2297n -linear. Consequently, the above right DGA square\nis commutative, and gives the last needed weak equivalence, \u03b9A\n1 \u2190 \u03b91 .\nThus, Proposition 33 is proved, and the proof of Theorem 7 is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\n5. A panorama of natural structures on punctured manifolds\nIn this section, we will define various additional structures on E-models, with emphasis on\nthe punctured case. They seem to be both highly natural, and potentially useful for further\napplications.\nOur starting point is like in Section 1: a Poincar\u00e9 duality algebra, H, over a field K,\ntogether with an orientation class, \u03c9 \u2208 H 2m \\ {0}. As noted in Remark 12, the associated\no\nmodels, En (H) and En (H), are bigraded differential algebras (DBGA's).\no\n\n5.1. Symmetry. The symmetric group \u03a3n acts (on the left) on both En (H) and En (H),\no\nby DBGA maps, and the canonical projection, En (H) \u2192 En (H), is a \u03a3n -equivariant DBGA\no\nmap. Geometrically, the above projection corresponds to the natural inclusion, F (X, n) \u0592\u2192\nF (X, n), which is equivariant with respect to the natural \u03a3n -actions on n-configurations.\nAlgebraically, the action of \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3n on the algebra generators is defined as follows.

By construction, all maps are multiplicative and bihomogeneous, on H\no \u2297n\n\n[Gij ] and\n\nH [Gij ] respectively. Starting from definitions (24)-(25), it is straightforward to check that\no\no\none has induced DBGA maps, {Sk : En (H) \u2192 En+1 (H)}0\u2264k\u2264n , as asserted. Similarly, for\nD0 and Dn+1 .\nLet us prove this now for Dk , with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Consider first the quotient algebra,\n\u2227(Gij ; n + 1 \u2265 i > j \u2265 1), modulo the Arnold relations (4). After uniform rescaling\nof degrees (that is, putting all Gij 's in degree 1, instead of 2m \u2212 1), this graded algebra\nbecomes isomorphic to H \u2217 F (R2 , n + 1). Moreover, the generator Gij is dual to tij , where\ntij \u2208 H1 F (R2 , n + 1) is the homology class of the standard generator \u03c3 ij \u2208 \u03c01 F (R2 , n + 1)\nfrom [3, Proposition 3.6]. See also [19]. With these identifications, our formulae (30),\ndefining Dk on the generators Gij , become dual to those from [3, Definition 2.9], which\nexpress the doubling operations on H1 F (R2 , n) in terms of the generators tij . (See [3,\n\u00a7 \u00a74.4-4.5] for the importance of doubling, viewed in the framework of chord diagrams from\nthe theory of finite type invariants of links.) In this way, Dk is identified with H \u2217 \u03b4k (where\n\u03b4k : F (R2 , n) \u2192 F (R2 , n + 1) is the geometric doubling), on the exterior generators; in\nparticular, Dk preserves relations (4). The preservation of relations (5) follows immediately\nfrom definitions (29)-(30), as well as the commutation relations,\n(31)\n\no\n\no\n\nDk dGij = dDk Gij ,\n\nP\no\nin the first two cases from (30). Finally, Dk dGk+1,k = \u03b1 (\u22121)deg(h\u03b1 ) \u03b9k (h\u03b1 * h\u2217\u03b1 ), according\nto the definitions. This sum equals zero, as asserted, since h\u03b1 * h\u2217\u03b1 = \u03c9, for all \u03b1, and \u03c9 = 0\no\nin H.\nTo finish the proof of our Proposition, it is enough to check the simplicial identities on\nthe algebra generators. On the exterior part, we have identified Dk with H \u2217 \u03b4k , for 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 n. Formulae (27)-(28) readily imply the identifications D0 \u2261 H \u2217 L and Dn+1 \u2261 H \u2217 R\n\n\fMULTIPLICATIVE MODELS FOR CONFIGURATION SPACES\n\n23\n\nrespectively. It is equally easy to check that Sk \u2261 H \u2217 (prk+1), for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, starting from\ndefinition (25). Therefore, it is enough to check the cosimplicial identities, for the continuous\nmaps {sk := prk+1 }0\u2264k\u2264n , and {\u2202 k := \u03b4k }1\u2264k\u2264n \u222a {\u2202 0 := L, \u2202 n+1 := R}, which is routine.\no\n\nSimilarly, one may check the simplicial identities also on generators coming from H, by\ncompletely straightforward dual calculations.\n\u0003\nRemarks 36. Formulae (24)-(30) make sense also for {En (H)}n . While {Sk }k induce\nDBGA maps, {Sk : En (H) \u2192 En+1 (H)}k , the others don't, in general. Indeed, for instance Dn+1 dGn+1,n = \u03b9n \u03c9 6= 0, while dDn+1 Gn+1,n = 0. This is related to the fact that, for\na closed manifold X, prn+1 : F (X, n + 1) \u2192 F (X, n) does not need to have a section.\nSimilarly, Dn dGn+1,n = e(H) * \u03b9n \u03c9, while dDn Gn+1,n = 0. Thus, Dn d 6= dDn , when the\ncharacteristic of K does not divide the Euler characteristic e(H). The topological counterpart\nof the potential failure of type (31) relations, in the closed case, is the fact that the doubling\noperations, {\u03b4k : F (X, n) \u2192 F (X, n + 1)}k , have no natural definition, when X does not\nadmit a nowhere zero vector field.\n5.3.

There is a natural topological action,\n(32)\n\no\n\n\u03b1\n\no\n\nT\nF (X, n0 ) \u00d7 F (R2m , n1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 F (R2m , nr ) \u2212\u2192\nF (X, n0 + n1 + * * * + nr ) ,\n\nfor any partition T of n := n0 + n1 + * * * + nr . Here, T := {Tj }0\u2264j\u2264r , {1, . . . , n} =\n` ` `\nT0 T1 * * * Tr , and nj := |Tj |, for j = 0, . . . , r. For each j, denote by \u03c6j the (unique)\n\u223c\norder-preserving bijection, \u03c6j : {1, . . . , nj } \u2192 Tj . To define the above action map, \u03b1T ,\no\no\nstart by viewing X from F (X, n0 ) as X \\ C, where C is a 2m-cube. Divide C into two\no\no\ncubes, C = C \u2032 \u222a C \u2032\u2032 , and view X from F (X, n) as X \\ C \u2032\u2032 . Next, subdivide C \u2032 into r\no\ncubes, C \u2032 = C1\u2032 \u222a * * * \u222a Cr\u2032 . Now, let x0 be an n0 -configuration in X, and let xj be given\nnj -configurations in R2m , for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 r. Define \u03b1T (x0 , x1 , . . . , xr ) to be the n-configuration\no\nin X obtained by putting the coordinates of x0 in X \\ C, on the positions prescribed by \u03c60 ,\nand those of xj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 r), suitably rescaled, in int(Cj\u2032 ), according to \u03c6j -prescriptions.\nNote that all spaces F (Cm , k) are formal, as follows from work by S. Yuzvinsky in [22].\nTheir cohomology algebras were computed by F.R. Cohen (see [7]); they have exterior generators {Gij ; k \u2265 i > j \u2265 1}, in degree 2m \u2212 1, and defining relations (4).\nWith these preliminaries, we may now define the algebraic analog of (32), that is, a DBGA\nmap,\nr\no\no O O \u2217\no\no\n(33)\nqT : (En (H), d) \u2192 (En0 (H), d)\n(\nH F (R2m , nj ), 0),\nj=1\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere the bigrading on \u2297j H F (R\n(2m \u2212 1, 1), as usual.\n\n2m\n\n, nj ) comes from putting all G-type generators in bidegree\n\nLet us define qT on algebra generators.

The compatibility of qT with the Arnold relations (4) from En (H) follows from an easy\nanalysis of the definition given in (34). Likewise, (5)-compatibility is an easy consequence\nof (34)-(35). Finally, we have to check the commutation of qT with differentials, on all\ngenerators Gij , n \u2265 i 6= j \u2265 1. In the second case from (34), as well as in the first case\no\n(subcase k > 0), this amounts to verifying that qT \u2206ij = 0. This in turn follows from the\nremark that, in all these cases, either i \u2208\n/ T0 or j \u2208\n/ T0 . This implies, via (35), that qT sends\no\no\no\no\n\u2206ij to zero, since obviously (\u03b5 \u2297 id)( \u2206) = (id \u2297 \u03b5)( \u2206) = (\u03b5 \u2297 \u03b5)( \u2206) = 0; see Definition 5.\no\no\no\nIn the remaining case, (34)-(35) readily imply that dqT (Gij ) = qT d(Gij ) = \u2206i\u2032 j \u2032 .\n\u0003\nRemark 38. Again, the existence of the natural topological action (32) is a peculiarity\nof the punctured case. This phenomenon is also reflected by algebra. For example, take\nT = {T0 , T1 }, with T0 = {1, . . . , n} and T1 = {n + 1}. Compare (26) and (28) with (34)\nand (35) to infer that, for this choice of T , qT = Dn+1 from \u00a7 5.2. As noted in Remarks 36,\nthe definition of qT would make sense also in the closed manifold case, but in that case qT\nwould not commute with d.\n5.4. Connected sum. We first recall the algebraic analog of the connected sum operation. Let (H, \u03c9H ) and (K, \u03c9K ) be two oriented K-Poincar\u00e9 duality algebras, of the same\nformal dimension, 2m. Define the underlying graded vector space of their connected sum by\no+\no+\nH K := K*1\u2295 H \u2295 K \u2295K*\u03c9, with \u03c9 in degree 2m. Extend the multiplications of H and\no+\no+\nK by setting h * k = 0, for h \u2208 H and k \u2208 K . In this way, (H K, \u03c9) becomes a Poincar\u00e9\no\nduality algebra, endowed with two (multiplicative) canonical projections, \u03c0H : H K \u2192 H,\no\nand \u03c0K : H K \u2192 K.\nThe connected sum operation for oriented manifolds provides a natural map,\no\n\no\n\nF (X, r) \u00d7 F ( Y , s) \u2192 F (X\n\nY, r + s),\n\nwhich sends ((x1 , . . . , xr ), (y1 , . . . , ys )) to (x1 , . . . , xr , y1 , . . . , ys ).
