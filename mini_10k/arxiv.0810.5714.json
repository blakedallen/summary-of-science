The sample includes 44 low redshift\nAGN with low or moderate obscuration (NH < 1023 cm\u22122 ) as indicated by X-rays and SED modeling.\nThe obscuration of the AGN allows us to see weaker emission components (host galaxy emission, AGN\nscattered light) which are usually outshone by the AGN. The first four eigenvectors explain 70% of\nthe variance in the sample. Eigenvector 1 (33% variance in the sample) correlates with the ratios\nof the intrinsic X-ray flux to the observed optical/IR fluxes and the F(2\u221210keV)/F([O III]) ratio.\nWe suggest that it is primarily driven by the L/LEdd ratio and strengthened by intrinsic absorption\n(both circumnuclear and galactic). Eigenvector 2 (18% of variance) correlates with optical/IR colors\n(B\u2212KS , B\u2212R, J\u2212KS ) and optical spectral type and depends on the contribution of the host galaxy\nrelative to the observed AGN emission. Eigenvector 3 (12% of variance) correlates with reddening\nindicators obtained from the X-rays (hardness ratio, spectral index, NH ) and the narrow H\u03b1/H\u03b2\nemission line ratio. Their relation suggests a common absorber for the optical/X-rays lying outside\nthe narrow-line region (NLR), possibly in a moderately inclined host galaxy. Eigenvector 4 (8% of\nvariance) correlates with the degree of polarization and the broad H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio, indicating that dust\nwhich scatters the nuclear emission (continuum and the broad-line region emission) also reddens the\nbroad-lines. Our analysis shows that, although as suggested by unification schemes, the inclination\ndependent obscuration (circumnuclear and the host galaxy) is important in determining the AGN\nSEDs, the L/LEdd ratio is the most important factor, followed by host galaxy emission.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - quasars: general\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical tool used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset\nwithout losing information. It transforms the old coordinate system where variables correlate among each\nother into a new coordinate system defined by a smaller\nnumber of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first principal component accounts for the\nmost variance in the data, and the successive principal\ncomponents explain as much of the remaining variance\nin the data as possible (see e.g. an introduction to PCA\nby Francis & Wills 1999 or Murtagh & Heck 1987).\nSince QSOs show a plethora of emission line and\ncontinuum properties, PCA is ideal for studying their\nproperties and understanding which are most important.\nPCA was first introduced to the AGN world by Boroson\n& Green (1992; hereafter BG92) who analyzed the optical emission line and continuum properties of a complete,\nlow redshift, Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) sample. It\nwas found that the primary eigenvector (EV1) is anticorrelated with Fe II \u03bb4570 strength (equivalent width and\nFe II/H\u03b2 ratio), correlated with [O III] \u03bb5007 strength\n(luminosity and peak) and H\u03b2 FWHM, and anticorrelated with the blue asymmetry of the H\u03b2 line. Hence\nBG92 concluded that EV1 is driven by a physical parameter that \"... balances Fe II excitation against illumi1 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge,\nMA 02138\n2 Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721\n3 IPAC, Caltech, MS 100-22, Pasadena, CA 91125\n4 Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, Poland\n\nnation of the narrow line region\". The BG92 EV1 was\nalso found to correlate with the soft X-ray properties:\nluminosity and spectral index (Boroson & Green 1992;\nCorbin 1993; Laor et al. 1994, 1997, Wang et al. 1996,\nBrandt & Boller 1998) and the correlations were found\nto be stronger than with the individual emission line parameters (Brandt & Boller 1998). This implied that EV1\nhas a more fundamental physical meaning. Physical parameters that have been suggested to drive EV1 include:\nthe L/LEdd ratio, orientation, and black hole spin. Since\nEV1 is correlated with [O III] emission, thought to be\nan isotropic property, BG92 concluded that EV1 is not\ndriven by orientation. Although the isotropy of the [O III]\nemission has since been called into question (Jackson &\nBrowne 1990, Di Serego Alighieri et al. 1997, Tadhunter\net al. 1998) the correlation of EV1 with the inclination\nindependent [O II] \u03bb3727 emission, originating at larger\ndistances from the nucleus than [O III], strongly supports\nthe EV1 orientation independence (Kuraszkiewicz et al.\n2000), at least for the radio-quiet subsample of the BQS.\nBG92 suggest that the L/LEdd ratio is the primary driver\nof EV1.\nBG92 EV1 was also found to correlate with the UV\nemission line properties: CIII] width, SiIII]/CIII] ratio,\nCIV and NV strength, CIV line shift (Wills et al. 1999,\nWills, Shang, & Yuan 2000, Sulentic et al. 2000), suggesting that EV1 is also linked to the physics of fueling\nand outflow and that higher accretion rates are linked to\ndenser gas and possibly higher nuclear starburst activity\n(Wang et al. 2006).\nBy combining observational data together with numer-\n\n\f2\n\nKuraszkiewicz et al.\n\nical simulations, Marziani et al. (2001) and Sulentic et al.\n(2000) were able to reproduce the correlations between\noptical emission line properties found in EV1 and confirm that EV1 is related to L/LEdd, but suggest that, in\ntheir sample, orientation is also important. Their sample includes both the BQS quasars from BG92 (face-on,\nlow obscuration), and inclined/reddened sources of intermediate type and Type 2 AGN that have FOS/HST\nspectra.\nA different way to approach the analysis of AGN properties is spectral PCA first applied by Francis et al.\n(1992) to the analysis of more than 200 spectra from\nthe Large Bright QSO Survey (LBQS; redshift range:\n0.2 \u2264 z < 3.4) or by Shang et al. (2003) to the spectra\nof PG QSOs. Their analysis is superseded by Yip et al.\n(2004) who analyze spectra of more than 16,000 QSOs\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with a wider\nrange of redshifts (0 < z < 5.4), inclinations and/or reddening values. Their spectral PCA found the following\nprincipal components: mean spectrum, host galaxy component, UV\u2013optical continuum slope, and correlations of\nBalmer emission lines. Although the results obtained\nfrom spectral PCA and emission line+SED PCA are difficult to compare, it is interesting to invoke them here\nfor comparison with our results.\nIn this paper we analyze a sample of red (J\u2212KS\n> 2) low-redshift 2MASS AGN with moderate absorp23\ntion NH <\ncm\u22122 . Their SEDs were analyzed in detail\n\u223c 10\nin Kuraszkiewicz et al. (2008; hereafter Paper I) and the\nemission line properties are presented in Kuraszkiewicz\net al. (2008 in preparation; hereafter Paper II). In this\npaper we run PCA on the SED and optical emission line\ncorrelation matrix and present our interpretation of the\neigenvectors in this moderately absorbed 2MASS AGN\nsample. It is important to state here that the results\nof the PCA analysis are dependent on the selection of\nthe sample and chosen properties. We do not expect the\nsame eigenvectors in the analysis of the 2MASS AGN\nsample as those found by BG92 in the unobscured, faceon PG QSO sample. The PG QSOs' first two eigenvectors were dominated by the parameters of the central engine (L/LEdd and accretion rate \u2013 Boroson 2002), while\nour 2MASS AGN sample, due to AGN obscuration, is\nwell suited for studies of weaker components such as the\nhost galaxy emission and intrinsic absorption.\n2. THE SAMPLE AND ITS PROPERTIES\n\nThe sample includes 44 red (J\u2212KS > 2) 2MASS AGN\nselected to have B\u2212KS > 4.3, and KS < 13.8, and\nobserved by Chandra (see Paper I for more details).\nThe sources have K band luminosities comparable to\nthose of quasars (Cutri et al. 2002) and lie at low redshift (z < 0.37). The sample shows a wide range of\n<\n\u03b1KX <\nobserved KS -band-to-X-ray(1keV) slopes (1.1 \u223c\n\u223c 2;\nWilkes et al. 2002), and a broad range of observed polarization fraction at R band (0% < P < 13%; Smith\net al. 2002, 2003). As found in Paper I the sample's median SED is redder than that of the blue optically/radio\nselected QSOs (Elvis et al. 1994) or the hard\u2013X\u2013ray selected AGN (Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2003), showing little\nor no big blue bump and implying that near-IR color selection isolates the reddest subset of AGN that can be\nclassified optically. Modeling of the near-IR/optical colors and X-ray spectral analysis in Paper I implies mod-\n\nerate amounts of reddening (NH < f ew \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ).\nThe more highly obscured AGN in this sample are most\nlikely viewed at intermediate angles, where the central\nengine is obscured from our view by either circumnuclear dust or dust lying further out in the host galaxy\ninclined to our line of sight. The obscuration allows us\nto see/study the contributions of weaker emission components such as host galaxy emission or AGN scattered\nlight emission which are normally outshone by the bright\nAGN. The sample includes: 7 Type 1 AGN with optical\nspectra resembling NLS1 or BALQSOs, 11 Type 2s with\nlow (for a Type 2) NH \u223c 1022 cm\u22122 , and 26 intermediate\ntype sources. Many of the 2MASS AGN studied here\nalso show high optical polarization (P > 4%).\n3. PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nIn order to investigate the relative importance of various parameters in determining the SED shapes and\nemission\u2013line properties in the red 2MASS sources, we\nanalyze the relations between the continuum parameters and emission-line parameters by running principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) on the correlation matrix.\nThe first PCA run included all continuum properties\nanalyzed in Paper I (Sections 4,5,6): optical and nearIR colors (B\u2212R, B\u2212KS , J\u2212KS ), optical type, optical\nslope, \u03b1opt , from optical spectra, degree of polarization, redshift, X-ray slope, intrinsic absorption NH , Xray hardness ratio, X-ray (1keV) luminosity (all from\nChandra spectral fitting), bolometric luminosity from\nSEDs, various IR/optical/X-ray flux or luminosity ratios5 , and the emission\u2013line parameters from Paper II:\nW\u03bb , FWHM, shift from systemic redshift of: H\u03b2 (broad\nand narrow components), H\u03b1 (broad and narrow components), [O III], [O II], optical Fe II, and the following line\nratios: [O II]/[O III], H\u03b2 broad /[O III] , H\u03b2 narrow /[O III],\nH\u03b1narrow /H\u03b2 narrow , H\u03b1broad /H\u03b2 broad , Fe II/H\u03b2 broad ,\nFe II/H\u03b2 narrow , Fe II/[O III]. A total of 56 parameters\nwere analyzed. The EW, FWHM, line shifts, most line\nratios, and optical\u2013to\u2013IR and IR\u2013to\u2013IR luminosity ratios did not contribute to the first few eigenvectors and\nrunning PCA with or without them gave similar results\n(i.e. nearly identical eigenvectors). To simplify the analysis these parameters were omitted from the final PCA\nrun. The final set of parameters is shown in the first column of Table 1. Columns 2\u20135 show their relation with\nthe first four eigenvectors (bold font denoting parameters\nthat dominate the eigenvector) and quote in percentages\nhow much variance they explain. Together the first four\neigenvectors explain 70.3% of the variance in the sample.\nTheir interpretation is presented below.\n3.1. Eigenvector 1\n\nMost of the variance (32.9%) in the sample is due to\nthe correlations between the ratios of the intrinsic 1 keV\nX-ray flux to the observed optical/IR flux: F (1keV )/FB ,\nF (1keV )/FR , F (1keV )/FI , F (1keV )/FJ , F (1keV )/FK\n(see Fig. 1). We choose to use the observed optical and IR\n5 Flux/luminosity ratios included: F(1keV)/F , F(1keV)/F ,\nB\nR\nF(1keV)/FI ,\nF(1keV)/FK ,\nL(0.2-0.4\u03bcm)/L(0.4-0.8\u03bcm),\nL(0.2-0.4\u03bcm)/L(0.8-1.6\u03bcm),\nL(0.4-0.8\u03bcm)/L(0.8-1.6\u03bcm),\nL(1-10\u03bcm)/L(10-100\u03bcm),\nL(3-60)\u03bcm)/L(60-100\u03bcm),\nL(0.81.6\u03bcm)/L(1-100\u03bcm),\nL(0.8-1.6\u03bcm)/L(60-100\u03bcm),\nL(0.81.6\u03bcm)/L(3-60\u03bcm)\n\n\fPCA of the SED and Emission Line Properties of Red 2MASS AGN\nfluxes since, in this moderately obscured/inclined sample, these fluxes depend on intrinsic reddening and host\ngalaxy emission, which are a priori unknown and hence\ndifficult to subtract. The X-ray fluxes, on the other\nhand, are corrected for intrinsic absorption, which was\nestimated from the Chandra X-ray spectral fitting in the\nfollowing way: the higher ( >\n\u223c 80) count sources were fit\nwith a power-law and rest-frame absorption with both\nparameters free (hereafter referred to as the \"C\" fits),\nthe medium (\u223c 30 \u2212 80) count sources, were fit with\na fixed power-law with an X-ray photon index \u0393 = 2\nand NH free (\"B\" fits). For the lowest count sources\n(<\n\u223c 30 counts; \"A\" fits), fits were made using a powerlaw with fixed \u0393 = 2 and NH = 7.6 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (the\nmedian absorption from the C fits). The importance of\nthe optical/X-ray flux ratio can be understood, for example, in the disk-wind model paradigm (Murray & Chiang\n1990, Proga et al. 2005, and references therein), which\npredict coupling between processes producing X-ray and\noptical/UV photons. EV 1 is also strongly anticorrelated\nwith the F ([O III])/F (2 \u2212 10keV ) ratio (see Fig. 2).\nTo understand the meaning of EV1 we need to take a\ncloser look at the objects with extreme values of EV1.\nTheir SEDs and optical spectra are presented in Figures 3 and 4, and their properties are summarized in\nTable 2. We find that the most negative EV1 sources\n(Fig. 3) with lowest F (1keV )/FB,R,I,J,K and highest\nF([O III])/F(2\u221210keV), are Type 1\u20131.5 with blue optical\nspectra dominated by strong Fe II and weak (relatively to\nH\u03b2) [O III] emission, that resemble the spectra of NLS1s\nand BALQSOs. Although their low S/N X-ray spectra\n(A fits) do not yield an estimate for NH , modeling of\nB\u2212R and J\u2212KS colors in Paper I (Section 5) gave low\n21\nNH <\ncm\u22122 (hence their X-ray fluxes are likely\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\noverestimated since NH = 7.6 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 was assumed\nfor these A fits during spectral fitting) and shows that\nthe SEDs at optical wavelengths are dominated by AGN\nemission (>94% of total observed flux at R band is due\nto the AGN in these sources).\nThe most positive EV1 sources (Fig. 4) with highest\nF (1keV )/FB,R,I,J,K and lowest F([O III])/F(2\u221210keV),\nare Type 1.9\u20132, with red spectra showing strong [O III]\nand [O II] emission, and weak Fe II and H\u03b2 emission and\nstrong galactic features. X-ray spectral fitting gives NH\n\u223c 1022 cm\u22122 consistent with reddening obtained from\nthe modeling of B\u2212R and J\u2212KS colors in Paper I (Section 5), that also shows high host galaxy contribution at\noptical wavelengths (>61% of the total observed flux at\nR band is due to host galaxy).\nThe luminosity of the [O III] \u03bb5007 emission line, originating from the narrow-line region (NLR), has been suggested as an indicator of the intrinsic nuclear luminosity\nof the AGN due to the similarity of the [O III]-to-hardX-ray flux ratio between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies (Mulchaey et al. 1994, Alonso-Herrero et al. 1997,\nTurner et al. 1997). As presented in Fig. 2 the most\nnegative EV1 sources do not follow the [O III] to hardX-ray relation showing higher F([O III])/F(2\u221210keV) ratios. This indicates that in these sources the intrinsic\nX-rays are weak. The most positive EV1 sources, on the\nother hand, have lower F([O III])/F(2\u221210keV) indicating\nstrong intrinsic X-rays.\nThe differences in X-ray output relative to optical/UV\n\n3\n\nmay be explained for example by an accretion disk and\ncorona model of Witt, Czerny, & \u017bycki (1997). In this\nmodel both the accretion disk and corona accrete and\ngenerate energy through viscosity, and division of the\nflow into optically thin (corona) and optically thick (disk)\nregions results from the cooling instability discussed by\nKrolik, McKee and Tarter (1981). The model is defined\nby 3 parameters: the mass of the central black hole,\nthe ratio of the luminosity to the Eddington luminosity L/LEdd (or the accretion rate \u1e40), and the viscosity\nparameter (\u03b1vis ) assumed to be the same in both the disk\nand the corona. The model predicts a systematic change\nin the opt/UV/X-ray SED as a function of L/LEdd. For\nhigh L/LEdd, the big blue bump is stronger both in luminosity and relative to the X-rays so the F (1keV )/FB\nratio is low (as in low EV1 sources). For low L/LEdd\nthe big blue bump is weaker and the F (1keV )/FB ratio\nbecomes high (as in high EV1 sources; see Fig. 5). Since\nthe accretion disk and corona model predictions match\nthose with EV1, they suggest that EV1 is fundamentally\nrelated (i.e. anti-correlated) to the L/LEdd ratio. This\nis further strengthened by the fact that the most negative EV1 sources (with lowest F (1keV )/FB ) show optical\nspectra that characterize NLS1s and BALQSOs (strong\nFe II and weak [O III] emission) that are thought to have\nhigh L/LEdd (e.g. Pounds, Done & Osborne 1995, Boller,\nBrandt, Fink 1996, Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2000).\nFrom Table 1 and Fig. 1c,d we see that the correlation between EV1 and the F(1keV)/FB ratio is stronger\nthan the correlation between EV1 and F(1keV)/FK . The\noptical/IR fluxes used to calculate these flux ratios are\nobserved, not intrinsic, so they are affected by dust reddening (and to a lesser extent also by host galaxy emission). Fluxes at optical wavelengths will be more affected\nthan those at near-IR wavelengths. Since EV1 shows\nstronger correlation with the F (1keV )/FB ratio, which\ndepends both on the L/LEdd and reddening, and shows\nmore scatter with the F (1keV )/FK ratio, which depends\nmostly on the L/LEdd, and less on reddening, we conclude that EV1 is dominated by L/LEdd. However, dust\nobscuration also contributes as it stretches the underlying L/LEdd driven correlation, at optical wavelengths, in\nthese moderately obscured 2MASS sources. If dust obscuration is inclination dependent then this result is consistent with Marziani et al. (2001) who suggest that their\nEV1 found for a heterogeneous sample of mixed type (1,\n2 and intermediate) AGN, is related to the L/LEdd ratio\nconvolved with orientation.\n3.2. Eigenvector 2\n\nEigenvector 2 (hereafter EV2), which explains 17.8%\nof the variance in the sample, is dominated by the observed optical/IR colors (in order of importance): B\u2212KS ,\nB\u2212R, J\u2212KS , and optical spectral type (see Table 1). In\nPaper I we found that the optical B\u2212R color, and to\na lesser extent the near-IR J\u2212KS color in the 2MASS\nAGN sample, are affected by reddening and host galaxy\nemission (and in a few, highly polarized objects, also\nby scattered AGN light). We recall the results of the\noptical/IR color modeling from Paper I in Fig. 6. The\ncolors of a pure reddened AGN (median QSO SED from\nElvis et al. 1994 reddened by Milky Way dust; long-dash\u2013\nshort-dash line) are modified by host galaxy emission\n\n\f4\n\nKuraszkiewicz et al.\n\n(Buzzoni 2005 templates), where a range of host galaxy\nstrengths relative to the intrinsic, unreddened AGN at\nR band was assumed (intrinsic AGN/host galaxy ratio\n= 5\u221240). For AV <\n\u223c 3 the optical/near\u2013IR colors are dominated by the AGN. At higher AV the B\u2212R colors become bluer and more consistent with the host galaxy colors (represented by thick solid lines). The J\u2212KS colors\nare much less dependent on reddening and host galaxy,\nonly visible if their contribution is strong i.e. AV > 10\nand AGN/host galaxy ratio low (compare for example\n(Sd05;5) and (Sd05;40) curves that have a high and low\nhost galaxy contribution respectively).\nIn Table 2 we summarize the properties of extreme\nEV 2 objects. We find that the most positive EV2 objects\nare the bluest in B\u2212R, implying a strong big blue bump.\nThey also have the bluest B\u2212KS colors in sample. They\nare Type 1s, with optical spectra showing strong Fe II and\nweak [O III] emission, resembling spectra of NLS1 and\nBALQSO. Column densities derived from X-ray spectral\n21\nfitting are low ( <\ncm\u22122 ), and the optical/IR\n\u223c 1.5\u00d710\ncolors are modeled with a pure, unreddened AGN with\nno host galaxy contribution.\nThe most negative EV2 objects are red in B\u2212KS , B\u2212R\nand J\u2212KS color. The red optical/IR colors are modeled\nwith an AGN reddened by dust with AV =10\u201311 mag.\nSuch reddening is sufficient to fully obscure the AGN\nat optical wavelengths, giving way to a large (98% at\nR band) contribution from the host galaxy. At near-IR\nwavelengths the reddened AGN colors still dominate in\nthese sources. The red J\u2212KS > 3 color can only be\nproduced by a reddened AGN and not the host galaxy\nwhich has bluer colors: J\u2212KS = 0.8\u22121 (see Fig. 6).\nIn Fig. 7 we divide the sources according to the amount\nof host galaxy contribution relative to the total emission\nat R band obtained from the optical/IR color modeling\n(numbers are from Table 7 in Paper I). We find that\nthe amount of host galaxy contribution relative to the\nreddened AGN decreases with increasing EV2 values.\nThis implies that EV2 depends on the amount of host\ngalaxy contribution, relative to the observed/reddened\nAGN, where at one (negative) end of EV2 reside pure,\nunreddened AGN dominating the output at optical/nearIR wavelengths, and on the other (positive) end reside\nreddened AGN whose output at optical wavelengths is\ndominated by host galaxy emission. A stronger correlation of EV2 with the B\u2212R color than the J\u2212KS color\ndemonstrates that the B\u2212R color is much more sensitive\nto host galaxy contamination than the J\u2212KS color, as\nshown by the color-color modeling (see Fig. 6 or detailed\ndiscussion in Paper I). Yip et al. (2004), who analyze\nthe SDSS QSO spectra (sample with a wide range of\nredshifts, inclination angles and reddening values) using\nspectral PCA, also find that their second principle component is related to the host galaxy.\n3.3. Eigenvector 3\n\nEigenvector 3 (hereafter EV3; 11.6% of the variance)\nis dominated (in order of importance) by: X-ray hardness ratio, X-ray spectral index \u0393X , column density NH\n(measured only in the high and medium S/N Chandra\nspectra i.e. in the C and B fits) and the narrow H\u03b1/H\u03b2\nemission line ratio. In Fig. 8 we show two representative correlations between EV3 and the X-ray hardness\nratio and the narrow H\u03b1/H\u03b2 emission line ratio. All of\n\nthese parameters are related to the amount of obscuration in X-rays or optical. Their relation implies a common absorber for the optical and X-rays, lying outside\nthe NLR, possibly in a host galaxy inclined to our line\nof sight (as in Polletta et al. 2008, Deo et al. 2007). This\nfinding is supported by the HST/WFPC2 I-band images\nof the 2MASS AGN, which show that these sources reside mostly in host galaxies with inclination angles of\ni = 50 \u2212 75o (mean i=67o ; Marble et al. 2003). We\nconclude that EV 3 is likely dominated by host galaxy\nabsorption.\nThe presence of redshift as a component of EV3 (Table 1) is secondary to the presence of NH , for which measurements become less sensitive as redshift increases and\nthe absorption is shifted out of the soft X-ray band. The\ncorrelation coefficient reduces significantly if NH is corrected for redshift (assuming it is intrinsic).\n3.4. Eigenvector 4\nEigenvector 4 (hereafter EV4; 8.0% of the variance) is\ndominated by the degree of optical polarization, broad\nH\u03b1/H\u03b2 emission line ratio and redshift. The relation\nbetween the polarization and the broad H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio\nimplies that the same dust scatters the intrinsic continuum+broad lines and reddens the broad emission lines.\nSince there is no dependence on the narrow H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio\nin this eigenvector, this dust must lie outside the BLR\nbut not outside the NLR, i.e., either on the BLR/NLR\nborder, or within the NLR. This is consistent with the\nconclusions reached by Smith et al. (2003) based on spectropolarimetry of the 2MASS AGN. The correlation between EV4 and redshift is due to a correlation between\nredshift and polarization (chance probability \u223c 2%; there\nis no correlation with the broad H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio - chance\nprobability >60%). This may be a selection effect as\nhigher redshift sources will have a higher measured degree of polarization due to the wavelength dependence\nof dust scattering and lower host galaxy dilution as one\nmoves into restframe UV where the stellar contribution\ndecreases.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nPCA analysis of the SED and emission line parameters\nof a sample of 44 red J\u2212KS > 2, moderately obscured\n(NH < 1023 cm\u22122 ) 2MASS AGN shows that 70% of the\nvariance in the sample is explained by four eigenvectors,\neach having a physical explanation:\n\u2022 Eigenvector 1 (33% of variance in sample) correlates with the intrinsic X-ray to observed optical,\nIR and [O III] flux ratios, and is strongly related to\nthe L/LEdd ratio, as shown by disk-corona models,\nand strengthed by intrinsic reddening.\n\u2022 Eigenvector 2 (18% of variance) correlates with optical/IR colors and optical type, and, as shown\nby the optical/IR color modeling, is related to\nthe relative strength of the host galaxy to the observed/reddened AGN.\n\u2022 Eigenvector 3 (12% of variance) correlates with reddening indicators obtained from X-rays and narrow\nemission lines, indicating a common absorber that\naffects both the X-rays and narrow emission lines\n\n\fPCA of the SED and Emission Line Properties of Red 2MASS AGN\nand probably lies in a moderately inclined host\ngalaxy.\n\u2022 Eigenvector 4 (8% of variance) correlates with the\ndegree of polarization and broad H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio implying the presence of dust (different from the host\ngalaxy absorber in EV3) that scatters both the\nBLR and the continuum emission and reddens the\nbroad lines.\nPCA analysis of the SED and/or emission line properties of unobscured (BG92) and moderately obscured\nAGN (Marziani et al. 2001, red 2MASS sample presented\nhere) points to the L/LEdd ratio as the most important parameter in determining the SED and emission\nline properties in AGN. Since the red 2MASS sample\nhas moderate obscuration, EV1 is also slightly effected\nby reddening, as is the EV1 found by Marziani et al.\n(2001) in their heterogeneous sample of moderately obscured AGN. Successive eigenvectors pick up components\ndepending on the sample chosen: unobscured AGN samples (BG92) probe the properties of the bright central\nengine (BG92 EV2 is related to accretion rate - see Boroson 2002). Moderately obscured samples, such as the red\n2MASS AGN, pick up weaker components, like the host\ngalaxy emission, which become important as the reddening obscures the AGN emission. Spectral PCA of the\nmoderately obscured SDSS QSOs (Yip et al. 2004) also\nfinds its EV2 to be related to the host galaxy. Succes-\n\n5\n\nsive eigenvectors in the red 2MASS sample are related\nto dust obscuration, separated into circumnuclear and\nhost galaxy absorption. Our analysis is consistent with\nthe orientation-dependent unification scheme for AGN,\nwhere a range of inclination dependent obscuration and\nhost galaxy contribution (as suggested by Haas et al.\n2008) and most importantly L/LEdd ratios (as suggested\nby our PCA) can explain the properties of an AGN.\n\nWe wish to thank the referee, Gordon Richards, for\ncomments that helped improve the paper and Martin\nGaskell for useful discussions.

Inserts show examples\nof red 2MASS AGN SEDs with high and low Eigenvector 1 values.\n\n\fPCA of the SED and Emission Line Properties of Red 2MASS AGN\n\n11\n\nFig. 6.- Colors of a reddened AGN combined with contributions from a host galaxy. Long-dash-short-dash curve shows colors of a pure\nreddened AGN (Elvis et al. 1994 median QSO SED reddened by Milky Way dust). Dotted (green) lines represent AGN colors modified by\nemission from an elliptical host with a 15\u2013Gyr stellar population (E15; reddest in B\u2212R). Solid (blue) lines represent an AGN + Sd host\nand 5\u2013Gyr stellar population (Sd05; bluest in B\u2212R). Short-dashed (red) line: AGN + Sa host galaxy (B\u2212R colors intermediate between\nE15 and Sd05). Each curve starts at the colors of an unreddened (AV =0) AGN + host galaxy (bluest optical/IR colors) and extends to\nthe reddened (AV =10) AGN + host galaxy in steps of 1 mag. denoted by small triangles on the curves (curve (Sd05;5) has been extended\nto AV =20). Numbers in parenthesis give the host galaxy type and age of stars followed by the intrinsic, unreddened AGN/host galaxy flux\nratio at R band (e.g. (E15;10): elliptical host, 15\u2013Gyr stars, intrinsic AGN/host = 10). Thick solid curves indicate pure host galaxy (E\nand Sd) colors changing with star age (from 1 to 15\u2013Gyr). Overplotted are the observed colors of the red 2MASS AGN, divided according\nto the amount of host galaxy contribution at R band obtained from color-color modeling: where \u2264 20% (filled circles), 20-60% (squares),\nand > 60% (stars) of the total observed flux at R band is due to host galaxy emission.\n\n\f12\n\nKuraszkiewicz et al.\n\nFig. 7.- Correlations between Eigenvector 2 and the B\u2212KS and J\u2212KS colors.
