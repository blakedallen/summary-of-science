We show that even if a system is sufficiently close to be\nintegrable, global diffusion occurs on a set with peculiar topology, the so\u2013called Arnold web, and is\nqualitatively different from Chirikov diffusion, occurring in more perturbed systems.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe characterization of mechanisms for diffusion of orbits in quasi\u2013integrable Hamiltonian systems and\nsymplectic maps is a relevant topic for many fields of physics, such as celestial mechanics, dynamical\nastronomy, statistical physics, plasma physics and particle accelerators. Any dynamical state of an integrable system can be characterized with a set of action\u2013angle conjugate variables (I1 , . . . , In , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ),\nwhere the actions Ij are constants of motion, while the angles \u03c6j simply change linearly with time. The\nproperties of the system which are relevant for the stability are determined by the actions.\nSmall perturbations of integrable systems can produce a slow drift of the initial value of the actions,\nand after certain time these drifts can cumulate in such a way to drive the system into very different\nphysical state. By global drift we mean that orbits explore macroscopic regions of the action\u2013space. If\nthe drift behaves as a diffusion process (precisely, we mean that the numerically computed mean squared\ndistance of I1 , . . . , In with respect to their initial values grows, on average, linearly with time), we will\nrefer to it as global diffusion.\nIn 1979 Chirikov [1] described a possible model for global drift valid when the perturbation is greater\nthan some critical value. Chirikov's model has so far been successfully used to describe diffusion in\nsystems from different fields of physics (see, for example, [2]). One of the reasons of the broad detection\nof the Chirikov's diffusion is that its typical times fall within the simulation abilities of modern computers\nas far back as the seventies.\nFor smaller perturbations the systems fall within the range of celebrated perturbation theories such as\nKAM [3,4,5] and Nekhoroshev theorems [6], which leave the possibility for global drift only on a subset\nof the possible dynamical states with peculiar topology, the so\u2013called Arnold web, and force diffusion\ntimes to be at least exponentially long with an inverse power of the norm of the perturbation. The\ntheoretical possibility of global drift in quasi\u2013integrable systems has been first shown in 1964 by Arnold\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nDipartimento di Matematica Pura ed Applicata, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, via Belzoni 7, 35131 Padova, Italy.\nObservatoire de Nice, Bv. de l'Observatoire, B.P. 4229, 06304 Nice cedex 4, France.\n\n1\n\n\f[7] for a specific system, and is commonly called Arnold diffusion. Recently, Arnold's result has been\nmuch generalized [8]. Being interested to applications to specific systems, and in particular to systems\nof interest for physics, we use a numerical approach which, avoiding theoretical difficulties, measures\ndirectly the quantitative features of eventual long term diffusion. In 2003 we numerically detected a\nvery slow local diffusion confined to the Arnold web [9] in a model perturbed system. In this paper\nwe provide numerical evidence both on quasi\u2013integrable Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps of a\nrelevant phenomenon of global diffusion of orbits occurring on the Arnold web. More precisely, we show\nthat a set of well chosen initial conditions practically explores the whole web and the process behaves as\na global diffusion.\nIn section 2 we will describe the Arnold web of quasi\u2013integrable Hamiltonian systems and symplectic\nmaps and in section 3 we will describe the numerical methods used to detect the Arnold web and the\nglobal diffusion on it.\n\n2 Arnold web of quasi\u2013integrable systems\nFor definiteness, we refer to the Hamiltonian system with Hamilton function:\nH\u01eb =\n\nI12 I22\n+\n+ I3 + \u01eb f\n2\n2\n\n,\n\nf =\n\n1\n,\ncos(\u03c61 ) + cos(\u03c62 ) + cos(\u03c63 ) + 3 + c\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a small parameter and c > 0, so that the equations of motion for I1 , I2 , I3 \u2208 R and \u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 \u2208\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\nS1 are: I \u0307i = \u2212 \u2202H\nand \u03c6\u0307i = \u2202H\nfor any i = 1, 2, 3. In the integrable case (when \u01eb = 0) the actions\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\u2202Ii\nare constants of motion while the angles \u03c61 (t) = \u03c61 (0) + I1 t, \u03c62 (t) = \u03c62 (0) + I2 t, \u03c63 (t) = \u03c63 (0) + t\nrotate with frequencies \u03c91 = I1 , \u03c92 = I2 , \u03c93 = 1. Therefore, each couple of actions I1 , I2 characterizes\nan invariant torus T3 . For any small \u01eb different from zero, H\u01eb is not expected to be integrable. However,\nif \u01eb is sufficiently small, the KAM theorem applies ( H\u01eb is real analytic and H0 is isoenergetically non\u2013\ndegenerate): for any invariant torus of the original system with Diophantine non\u2013resonant frequencies1\nthere exists an invariant torus in the perturbed system which is a small deformation of the unperturbed\none. The complement of the set made of these invariant tori is called Arnold web, and in such a set, in\nprinciple, the motions can exhibit chaotic diffusion. Because Nekhoroshev theorem also applies to the\nsystem, any eventual chaotic diffusion will occur on very long times that grow at least exponentially with\nan inverse power of \u01eb. Precisely, because H0 is quasi\u2013convex, the following estimates apply: |I(t) \u2212\nI(0)| \u2264 a\u01eb1/6 , for any |t| \u2264 b exp(\u01eb0 /\u01eb)1/6 with a, b suitable positive constants (see [10] and also [16]).\nTo describe the topology of the Arnold web, it is convenient to refer to the subset of the phase space\ndetermined by the section S = {(I1 , I2 ) \u2208 R2 , \u03c6i = 0, i = 1, 2, 3}. From the KAM theorem, it follows\nthat any invariant torus cuts the section S in only one point (I1 , I2 ). Moreover, the Diophantine condition\non the frequencies implies that these points are outside a neighborhood of lines k1 I1 + k2 I2 + k3 = 0\nproportional to \u03b3/|k|\u03c4 , for any k = (k1 , k2, k3 ) \u2208 Z3 \\0. Therefore, the intersection between the Arnold\nweb and the section S consists of all these straight lines with a neighborhood which decreases as |k|\nincreases. Any of these straight lines is called resonance, and the integer |k| is called resonance order.\nThe Arnold web is open, dense, and has a small relative measure (proportional to \u03b3).\nThe case of quasi\u2013integrable symplectic maps is analogous. In this paper we consider the following\nquasi\u2013integrable symplectic map:\n\u03c6\u20321 = \u03c61 + I1\n\n,\n\n\u03c6\u20322 = \u03c62 + I2\n\nP\nP\n\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 are Diophantine if there exist positive constants \u03b3, \u03c4 such that | i ki \u03c9i | > \u03b3/|k|\u03c4 , with |k| = i |ki |, for all\nk = (k1 , k2 , k3 ) \u2208 Z3 \\0. The Diophantine condition considered in KAM theorem requires \u03c4 > 2 (for 3 degrees of freedom\nsystems) and \u03b3 which suitably rescales with \u01eb.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fI1\u2032 = I1 + \u01eb\n\n\u2202f\n(\u03c61 + I1 , \u03c62 + I2 )\n\u2202\u03c61\n\n,\n\nI2\u2032 = I2 + \u01eb\n\n\u2202f\n(\u03c61 + I1 , \u03c62 + I2 )\n\u2202\u03c62\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f = 1/(cos(\u03c61 ) + cos(\u03c62 ) + 2 + c), with c > 0. At small \u01eb, the KAM and Nekhoroshev theorems\n([11],[12],[13]) apply to this kind of maps. The resonances of this system are defined by the straight\nlines k1 I1 + k2 I2 + 2\u03c0k3 = 0, with k1 , k2 , k3 \u2208 Z\\0, and the topology of the Arnold web on the section\nS = {(I1 , I2 ) \u2208 R2 , \u03c6i = 0, i = 1, 2} is that described for Hamiltonian system (1).\n\n3 Global Arnold diffusion: numerical results\nA precise numerical detection of the Arnold web is possible with the so-called Fast Lyapunov Indicator\n(hereafter, FLI) method [14]. In [15] we showed that the Arnold web of system (1) indeed corresponds\nto the above theoretical description. In this paper, we are able to choose initial conditions which are\ngood candidates to diffuse thanks to the accurate detection of the web provided in [15]. In fact, within\nresonances, both chaotic and regular motions are observed. Of course, regular motions do not diffuse,\nand therefore diffusive orbits must be chosen in the small subset of the Arnold web made of chaotic\nmotions. But even within chaotic motions, to have the chance to observe the phenomenon one has to\nrestrict the choice of initial conditions to the single order resonances, i.e. to the portion of resonant lines\nwhich are far from the main crossing between\n\u221a resonances. The reason is that stability times are expected\nto be much longer at a distance of order \u01eb from these crossings (see, for example, [16]). With this\nselection of initial conditions, we have been able in [9] to show that indeed after times that increase\nfaster than power law, initial conditions diffuse along the chaotic border of resonant lines. Though the\ncomputational time used in [9] was already quite long, due to the slowness of Arnold diffusion, it was\nnot sufficient to evidence a global diffusion, i.e. the wandering of motions from one resonance to the\nothers. In this paper we provide numerical experiments that thanks to a much longer computational time,\nand proper choice of model parameters, display for the first time such global diffusion.\nThe crucial parameters to set in the models are \u01eb and the value ofRconstant c appearing\nin the deP\nnominator of the perturbation. In fact, any Fourier harmonic \u01ebfk = \u01eb f (\u03c6) exp(\u2212i i ki \u03c6)d\u03c6Pof the\nperturbing function f is proportional to \u01eb and decreases (asymptotically) exponentially with c i |ki |.\nThe values of the two parameters must be balanced so that \u01eb is smaller than the critical value for Chirikov\ndiffusion (determined with numerical\nmethods, see [15], [17]) and the value of c is not too large so that\nP\nharmonics with large order i |ki | produce measurable effects on the finite time scale of our numerical computations. We found suitable values for our experiments \u01eb = 0.6, c = 2 for the map (2), and\n\u01eb = 0.01, c = 1 for the Hamiltonian system (1). The Arnold webs detected with the FLI method corresponding to these values are shown in figures 1,2. In the figures, for each point of the action plane (I1 , I2 )\nwe plot a color corresponding to the FLI value according to the color scale reported below the figure.\nThe intermediate value of the FLI (orange in the color scale) corresponds to KAM tori. Darker regions\ncorrespond to initial conditions (I1 , I2 ) on the section S which produce resonant regular motions, while\nyellow regions correspond to initial conditions which produce chaotic motions. Each resonance appears\nas a darker orange region with a yellow border, or as a single yellow line (depending on the resonance\nand on the value of the angles chosen to define the section S; see [15] for more details). Therefore, the\nyellow region on the FLI map corresponds to the chaotic subset of the Arnold web, where an eventual\nArnold diffusion should be confined.\nFollowing the explained criterion of choosing initial conditions within resonant chaotic motions far\nfrom the crossings of resonances we have chosen ten initial conditions near (I1 , I2 ) = (0.316, 0.146) for\nthe Hamiltonian case (see figure 2a), and twenty initial conditions near (I1 , I2 ) = (1.71, 0.81) for the\nsymplectic map (see figure 1a). Then, we computed numerically the map up to 1011 iterations, and we\n3\n\n\fintegrated numerically with a symplectic integrator the Hamiltonian system up to a t \u223c 1011 time units.\nThe results are reported in figures 1 and 2: on the FLI map of the action plane (I1 , I2 ) we plotted as black\ndots all points of the orbits which have returned after some time on the section S. Of course, because\ncomputed orbits are discrete we represented points on the double section |\u03c61 | \u2264 0.005, |\u03c62 | \u2264 0.005\nfor both cases, and moreover \u03c63 = 0 for the Hamiltonian system; reducing the tolerance 0.005 reduces\nonly the number of points on the section, but does not change their diffusion properties. Figures 1a,2a\nshow only the location of initial conditions (inside the circles), and figures 1b,2b show the result after\nthe intermediate times 2.109 (109 for figure 2b). Figures 1c,2c,1d,2d show the result after much longer\ntimes. To properly display such long term evolutions we needed to use a zoomed out map of the action\nplane.\nIn both cases, the orbits filled a macroscopic region of the action plane whose structure is clearly that\nof the Arnold web. The orbits have moved along the single resonances, and avoided the center of the\nmain resonance crossings, in agreement with the theoretical results which predict longer stability times\nfor motions in these regions. The larger resonances (which correspond to the smallest orders |k|) are\npractically all visited, while this is not the case for the thinest ones (which correspond to the highest\norders |k|). This is in agreement with the theoretical results of [18], which predict that the speed of\ndiffusion on each resonance becomes smaller for resonances of high order. Therefore, the possibility of\nvisiting all possible resonances is necessarily limited by finite computational time.\nOn average, the drift behaves as a diffusion process. In fact, in the case of the map, the average\nevolution of the squared distance of (I1 , I2 ) from the initial datum, reported in fig. 3, increases almost\nlinearly with time, so that we can measure a diffusion coefficient (the average slope of the plot) D \u223c\n1.7 10\u221210 (we do not report the computation of the diffusion coefficient in the Hamiltonian case, which\nwould require a longer computation time to explore a broader region of action space).\nWe remark that this diffusion coefficient characterizes the global diffusion process, while diffusion\ncoefficients measured in [9] characterized local diffusion along a specific resonance.\n\n4 Conclusions\nIn this paper we detect a macroscopic diffusion of orbits on the Arnold web of quasi\u2013integrable Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps. The described diffusion phenomenon is very different from Chirikov\ndiffusion, where the overlapping of resonances allows diffusion in macroscopic regions of phase space in\nrelatively short time scales and without apparent peculiar topological properties of the stochastic region.\nThe study of the long\u2013term evolution in quasi\u2013integrable systems, especially the set up of statistical\nmethods, must therefore take into account that, at small perturbations, in a subset of phase space of\npeculiar structure there is an important phenomenon of diffusion of orbits. Indeed, it concerns various problems going from the old question of stability of the Solar System to the modern burden of the\nconfinement of particles in accelerators.\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: The four panels correspond to the FLI map of the action plane (I1 , I2 ) for the map (2), with\ninitial condition on the section S (see [15]), with different magnifications. The yellow region corresponds\nto the chaotic part of the Arnold web. Moreover, on panel (a) we mark with a circle the location of the\ntwenty initial conditions; on panel (b,c,d) we mark with a black dot all points of the twenty orbits\nwhich have returned after some time on the section S. We consider 2 109 iterations for panel (b); 2 1010\niterations for panel (c) and 1011 iterations for panel (d).\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: The four panels correspond to the FLI map of the action plane (I1 , I2 ) for the Hamiltonian\nsystem (1), with initial condition on the section S (see [15]), with different magnifications.

The total computation time t = 1011 iterations has been\ndivided in 103 intervals. For each initial condition, and for each interval [(n \u2212 1)108 , n108 ], we have\ncomputed the average of the squared distance of (I1 , I2 ) from the initial datum, taking into account only\npoints that in the interval [(n \u2212 1)108 , n108 ] are on the section S. Then, we averaged over all particles.\nReferences\n[1] B.V. Chirikov. An universal instability of many dimensional oscillator system. Phys. Rep., 52:263\u2013\n379, (1979).\n[2] A. Morbidelli.
