The PQCD calculation is reliable\nonly when the involved energy scale is hard enough, i.e. in the large recoil regions. Due to\nthe restriction to the \u03c0 energies smaller than the inverse lattice spacing, the lattice QCD\ncalculation becomes more difficult in the large recoil regions and at the present, the lattice\nQCD results of the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor are available only for soft regions, i.e.\n\nq 2 > 15GeV 2 . The lattice QCD results can be extrapolated to small q 2 regions, and the\n\ndifferent extrapolation methods might cause uncertainties about 5%[2]. While, the QCD\nLCSRs can involve both the hard and the soft contributions below q 2 < 18GeV 2 [4] and can\nbe extrapolated to higher q 2 regions[5, 6, 7]. Therefore, the results from the PQCD approach,\nthe lattice QCD approach and the QCD LCSRs are complementary to each other, and by\ncombining the results from these three methods, one may obtain a full understanding of the\nB \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in its physical region, 0 \u2264 q 2 \u2264 (MB \u2212 M\u03c0 )2 \u2243 25GeV 2 .\nCertain exclusive process involving hadrons can be described by PQCD if the momentum\ntransfer is sufficiently large. The amplitude can be factorized into the convolution of the nonperturbative wavefunction for each of the hadrons with a PQCD calculable hard-scattering\namplitude. The PQCD factorization theorem has been worked out in Refs.[14, 15] based\non the earlier works on the applications of PQCD to hard exclusive processes [16]. In the\npresent paper, we shall use the PQCD approach to calculate the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form\nfactor in the large recoil regions.\nIn the PQCD approach based on collinear factorization theorem, a direct calculation of\nthe one-gluon-exchange diagram for the B meson transition form factor suffers singularities\nfrom the endpoint region of a momentum fraction x \u2192 0. Because of these singularities,\nit was claimed that B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor is dominated by soft dynamics and not\ncalculable in PQCD[17]. In fact, in the endpoint region the parton transverse momenta k\u22a5\nare not negligible. After including the parton transverse momenta, large double logarithmic\ncorrections \u03b1s ln2 k\u22a5 appear in higher order radiative corrections and must be summed to\nall orders. In addition, there are also large logarithms \u03b1s ln2 x which should also be summed\n(threshold resummation[18]). The relevant Sudakov form factors from both k\u22a5 and the\n2\n\n\fthreshold resummation can cure the endpoint singularity which makes the calculation of the\nhard amplitudes infrared safe, and then the main contribution comes from the perturbative\nregions.\nAn important issue for calculating the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor is whether we need\nto take both the two wavefunctions \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B into consideration or simply \u03a8B is enough?\nIn literature, many authors (see Refs.[9, 10, 11]) did the phenomenological analysis with only\n\u03a8B , setting \u03a8\u0304B = 0 (or strictly speaking, ignoring the contributions from \u03a8\u0304B ). However, As\nhas been argued in Refs.[19, 20], one may observe that the distribution amplitudes (DAs)\nof those two wavefunctions have a quite different endpoint behavior, such difference may be\nstrongly enhanced by the hard scattering kernel. Even though \u03a8\u0304B (with the definition in\nRef.[13]) is of subleading order contribution, there is no convincing motivation for setting\n\u03a8\u0304B = 0. In the present paper, we shall keep both the two wavefunctions \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B to\ndo our calculations and show to what extent the \u03a8\u0304B can affect the final results. Another\nissue we need to be more careful is about the pionic twist-3 contributions. Based on the\nasymptotic behavior of the twist-3 DAs, especially \u03c6as\np (x) \u2261 1, most of the people pointed\nout a large twist-3 contribution[12, 21] to the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor, i.e. bigger\nthan that of the leading twist in almost all of the energy regions. In Ref.[22], the authors\nhave made a detailed analysis on the model dependence of the twist-3 contributions to the\npion electro-magnetic form factor, and have raised a new twist-3 wavefunction with a better\nendpoint behavior for \u03a8p , which is derived from the QCD sum rule moment calculation[23].\nAnd their results show that with such new form for \u03a8p , the twist-3 contributions to the\npion electro-magnetic form factor are power suppressed in comparison to the leading twist\ncontributions. According to the power counting rules in Ref.[21], the pionic twist-2 and\ntwist-3 contributions should be of the same order for the case of the B meson decays. With\nthe new form for \u03a8p [22], we show that for the case of the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor, even\nthough the twist-3 contributions are of the same order of the leading twist contributions, its\nvalues are less than the leading twist contribution.\nThe purpose of the paper is to examine the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in the PQCD\napproach, and to show how the PQCD results can match with the QCD LCSR results and the\nextrapolated lattice QCD results. In the PQCD approach, the full transverse momentum\ndependence (kT -dependence) for both the hard scattering part and the non-perturbative\nwavefunction, the Sudakov effects and the threshold effects are included to cure the endpoint\n3\n\n\fsingularity. In section II, based on the kT factorization formulism, we give the PQCD\nformulae for the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in the large recoil regions. In section III, we\ngive our numerical results and carefully study the contributions from \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B , and those\nB\u03c0\n2\nfrom the different pionic twist structures. The slope of the obtained form factors F+,\n0 (q ) in\n\nthe large recoil regions can match with those obtained from other approaches. Conclusion\nand a brief summary are presented in the final section.\n\nB \u2192 \u03c0 TRANSITION FORM FACTOR IN THE LARGE RECOIL REGIONS\n\nII.\n\nFirst, we give our convention on the kinematics. For convenience, all the momenta are\ndescribed in terms of the light cone (LC) variables. In the LC coordinate, the momentum\n+\n\nk\nk\nis described in the form, k = ( \u221a\n,\u221a\n, k\u22a5 ), with k \u00b1 = k 0 \u00b1 k 3 and k\u22a5 = (k 1 , k 2 ). The scalar\n2\n2\n\u2212\n\nproduct of two arbitrary vectors A and B is, A * B =\n\nA+ B \u2212 +A\u2212 B +\n2\n\n\u2212 A\u22a5 * B\u22a5 . The pion mass\n\nis neglected and its momentum is chosen to be in the minus direction.

The upper edge of the\nintegration |k\u22a5 | < 1/b is necessary to ensure that the wave function is soft enough[26].\nIn summary, we compare the results in Eqs.(4,5) with those in Refs.[12, 13, 20, 21]. In\nRef.[20], only leading twist (\u03a8\u03c0 ) of the pion is discussed. Setting the twist-3 terms to zero,\nthe two formulae in Eqs.(4,5) and Ref.[20] are in agreement. In Ref.[21], the single B meson\nwave function \u03a8B is assumed and the terms of \u03a8\u0304B and \u2206 are neglected. And in Ref.[13],\nwith a new definition for \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B , i.e.\n+\n\u2212\n\u03a8B = \u03a8+\nB , \u03a8\u0304B = (\u03a8B \u2212 \u03a8B ),\n\n(13)\n\nboth contributions from \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B are taken into consideration, with only the terms of \u2206\nare neglected. The momentum projector used in [13, 21] for the pion is different from the\n7\n\n\fpresent projector in Eq.(2), i.e. there is no term proportional to \u03a8\u03c3 in Refs.[13, 21]. Except\nfor these differences1 , the formulae in [13, 21] are consistent with ours. Our results agree\nwith Ref.[12], except for several minus errors that should be corrected there.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL CALCULATIONS\n\nIn the numerical calculations, we use\n\u039b(nf =4) = 250MeV, f\u03c0 = 131MeV, fB = 190MeV, mp0 = 1.30GeV.\nMS\n\n(14)\n\nB\nThe wavefunctions in the compact parameter b-space, \u03a8B\n+ (\u03be, bB ), \u03a8\u2212 (\u03be, bB ), \u03a8\u03c0 (x, b\u03c0 ),\n\n\u03a8p (x, b\u03c0 ) and \u03a8\u03c3 (x, b\u03c0 ) can be found in the appendix.\n\nThe kT -dependence has been\n\nkept in both the B meson and the pion wavefunctions. As has been argued in several\npapers[22, 27, 28, 29], the intrinsic kT -dependence of the wave function is important and the\nresults will be overestimated without including this effect, so it is necessary to include the\ntransverse momentum dependence into the wave functions not only for the B meson but also\nfor the pion. As has been argued in Ref.[22], we take mp0 = 1.30GeV for latter discussions,\nwhich is a little below the value given by the chiral perturbation theory[30].\nThe two wavefunctions \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B of the B meson shown in the appendix depend only\non the effective mass (\u039b\u0304 = MB \u2212 mb ) of the B meson. An estimate of \u039b\u0304 using QCD sum\nrule approach gives \u039b\u0304 = 0.57 \u00b1 0.07GeV [31]. In Fig.(2), we show the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form\nfactor with different value of \u039b\u0304, where the shaded band is drawn with a broader range for\n\u039b\u0304, i.e. \u039b\u0304 \u2208 (0.4GeV, 0.7GeV ). And for comparison, we show the QCD LCSR result [5] in\nsolid line and its theoretical error (\u00b110%) by a fuscous shaded band in Fig.(2). The results\nshow that the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor will decrease with the increment of \u039b\u0304. When\n\u039b\u0304 \u2208 (0.5GeV, 0.6GeV ), one may observe that the present results agree well with the QCD\n\nLCSR results[4, 5] up to q 2 \u223c 14GeV 2 . In Fig.(2), for simplicity, only the QCD LCSR results\nof Ref.[5] are shown. The LCSR results in Refs.[4, 5] are in agreement with each other even\n\nthough they have taken different ways to improve the QCD LCSR calculation precision, i.e.\nin Ref.[4], an alternative way to do the QCD LCSR calculation is adopted in which the\npionic twist-3 contributions are avoided by calculating the correlator with a proper chiral\n1\n\nAccording to the power counting rules in Ref.[21], the terms that do not existent in Ref.[21] are defined\nas sub-leading terms in 1/MB and are neglected accordingly.

The dashed line stands for \u039b\u0304 = 0.5GeV , the dotted line stands for\n\u039b\u0304 = 0.6GeV , the upper edge of the shaded band corresponds to \u039b\u0304 = 0.40GeV and the lower edge\nof the band corresponds to \u039b\u0304 = 0.70GeV . For comparison, the solid line comes from the QCD\nLCSR[4, 5] and the fuscous shaded band shows its theoretical error \u00b110%.\n\ncurrent and then the leading twist contributions are calculated up to next-to-leading order;\nwhile in Ref.[5], the usual QCD LCSR approach is adopted and both the twist-2 and twist-3\ncontributions are calculated up to next-to-leading order. In Ref.[13], \u039b\u0304 is treated as a free\nparameter and a bigger value is adopted there, i.e. \u039b\u0304 = (0.70 \u00b1 0.05)GeV . The main reason\nis that in the present paper, we have used an improved form (with better endpoint behavior\nthan that of the asymptotic one) for the pionic twist-3 wavefunction \u03a8p , while in Ref.[13],\nthey took \u03c6p in Ref.[7] (with an endpoint behavior even worse than the asymptotic one)\nother than \u03a8p to do the calculations, so the value of \u039b\u0304 in Ref.[13] must be big enough to\nsuppress the endpoint singularity coming from the hard kernel. For clarity, if not specially\nstated, we shall fix \u039b\u0304 to be 0.5GeV in the following discussions.\nSecond, to get a deep understanding of the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor, we discuss the\ncontributions from different parts of the B meson wavefunction or the pion wave function,\ncorrespondingly. Here we take F+B\u03c0 (q 2 ) to do our discussions and the case of F0B\u03c0 (q 2 ) can\nbe done in a similar way. In Fig.(3a), we show the contributions from the different twist\nstructures of the pion wave function, i.e. \u03a8\u03c0 , \u03a8p and \u03a8\u03c3 (the contributions from the terms\ninvolving \u03a8\u2032\u03c3 are included in \u03a8\u03c3 ), respectively.

The right diagram is for the\ndifferent B meson structures, \u03a8B , \u03a8\u0304B and \u2206, where \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B are defined in Eq.(8).\n\ncontribution from \u03a8\u03c0 is the biggest, then comes that of \u03a8p and \u03a8\u03c3 . And the ratio between\nall the twist-3 contributions and the leading twist contribution is \u223c 70% in the large recoil\nregions. This behavior is quite different from the conclusion that has been drawn in Refs.[12,\n21], in which they concluded that the twist-3 contribution is bigger than that of twist-2\ncontribution, especially in Ref.[12], it claimed that the twist-3 contribution is about three\ntimes bigger than that of twist-2 at q 2 = 0. Such kind of big twist-3 contributions are due to\nthe fact that they only took the pion distribution amplitudes into consideration (or simply\nadding a harmonic transverse momentum dependence for the pion wavefunctions), and then\nthe endpoint singularity coming from the hard kernel can not be effectively suppressed,\nespecially for \u03a8p whose DA's asymptotic behavior is \u03c6p \u2261 1. In Ref.[22], the authors have\nmade a detailed analysis on the model dependence of the twist-3 contributions to the pion\nelectro-magnetic form factor, and have raised a new twist-3 wavefunction (as is shown in\nthe appendix) with a better endpoint behavior for \u03a8p , which is inspired from QCD sum rule\nmoment calculation. With this model wave function for \u03a8p , Ref.[22] shows that the twist-3\ncontributions of the pion electro-magnetic form factor agree well with the power counting\nrule, i.e. the twist-3 contribution drops fast and it becomes less than the twist-2 contribution\nat Q2 \u223c 10GeV 2 .

Fig.(3b) presents the\ncontributions from \u03a8B , \u03a8\u0304B and \u2206 respectively, where \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B are defined in Eq.(8).\nFrom Fig.(3b), one may observe that the contribution from \u2206 is quite small and can be\nsafely neglected as has been done in most of the calculations. However the contribution from\n\u03a8\u0304B is quite large, i.e. at q 2 = 0, the ratio between the contributions of \u03a8\u0304B and \u03a8B is about\n(\u221270%), which roughly agrees with the observation in Ref.[12]. So the negative contribution\nfrom \u03a8\u0304B can not be neglected, and it is necessary to suppress the big positive contribution\nfrom \u03a8B so as to get a more reasonable total contributions from both \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B . The above\nresults of Fig.(3b) is obtained by using the definition Eq.(8). A new definition (13) for \u03a8B\nand \u03a8\u0304B has been raised in Ref.[13] and the contributions from the \u03a8B , \u03a8\u0304B and \u2206 with such\na new definition (13) are shown in Fig.(4a).

The solid, dashed and dotted lines are the results obtained in Ref.[21]\nand are for \u03c9B = 0.36GeV, 0.40GeV and 0.44GeV respectively. The shaded band are our present\nresults with the upper edge for \u039b\u0304 = 0.50GeV and the lower edge for \u039b\u0304 = 0.60GeV , respectively.\nFor comparison, the dash-dot line stands from the QCD LCSR result[4, 5].\n\nthe new definition (13) for \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B , the contribution from \u03a8\u0304B is not small (\u223c 25 \u2212 40%)\nand it can not be safely neglected. Thus both \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B should be kept in the calculation\nfor giving a better understanding of the B decays.\nB\u03c0 2\nFinally, we make a comparison of the present results for F+,0\n(q ) with those obtained in\n\nRef.[21] in Fig.(5). In Ref.[21], \u03a8\u0304B has been neglected and \u03a8B takes the form\n\"\n\n1 xMB\n\u03a8B (x, bB ) = NB x (1 \u2212 x) exp \u2212\n2 \u03c9B\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03c9 2 b2\n\u2212 B B ,\n2\n#\n\n(15)\n\nwhere NB is the normalization factor and \u03c9B is taken to be (0.40 \u00b1 0.04)GeV . In Fig.(5),\nwe show their results for \u03c9B = 0.36GeV, 0.40GeV and 0.44GeV and our present results\nwith \u039b\u0304 \u2208 (0.5GeV, 0.6GeV ), respectively. The two results in the large recoil regions q 2 \u223c 0\nare consistent with each other, however one may observe that the fast rise in Ref.[21] has\nbeen suppressed in our present results and the slope of the present obtained form factors\nB\u03c0\n2\nF+,\n0 (q ) are more consistent with the QCD LCSR results in Ref.[4, 5]. The main reason\n\nfor the differences between our present results and those in Ref.[21] is that we have used a\nbetter endpoint behavior wavefunction for \u03a8p [22]. With this new form for \u03a8p , we find that\nthe total twist-3 contributions are in fact less than (\u223c 70%) the leading twist contribution\n12\n\n\fin the large recoil regions. While in Ref.[21], the twist-3 contributions are about two times\nbigger than that of the leading twist, especially for the bigger q 2 regions, and then the total\ncontributions will give a fast rise in shape.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n\nIn the present paper, we have examined the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in the PQCD\napproach, where the transverse momentum dependence for the wavefunction, the Sudakov\neffects and the threshold effects are included to regulate the endpoint singularity and to\nderive a more reasonable result. We emphasize that the transverse momentum dependence\nfor both the B meson and the pion is important to give a better understanding of the B \u2192 \u03c0\ntransition form factor. The pionic twist-3 contributions to the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor\nare carefully studied with a better endpoint behavior wavefunction for \u03a8p , and Fig.(3)\nshows that the twist-3 contributions are of the same order of the leading twist contribution,\nhowever its values are less than that of the leading twist. This observation improves the\nresults obtained in Refs.[12, 21], in which the asymptotic behavior for \u03c6p was used and they\nclaimed a large twist-3 contributions to the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor, i.e. bigger than\nthat of the leading twist. Fig.(3b) and Fig.(4) show that both \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B are important, no\nmatter what definition (Eq.(8) or Eq.(13)) is chosen. Under the definition (8), the negative\ncontribution from \u03a8\u0304B is necessary to suppress the big contribution from \u03a8B and to obtain\na reasonable total contributions. While under the definition Eq.(13), the contribution from\n\u03a8\u0304B is power suppressed to that of \u03a8B , however it still can contribute 25 \u2212 40% to the total\nB\u03c0\n2\ncontributions. As is shown in Fig.(5), a comparison of our present results for F+,\n0 (q ) with\n\nthose in Ref.[21] shows that a better PQCD result (with its slope closes to the QCD LCSR\nresults) can be obtained by carefully considering both the pionic twist-3 contributions and\nthe contributions from the two wavefunctions \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B of the B meson.\nIn the literature, the values of the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factors F+B\u03c0 (0) and F0B\u03c0 (0)\n\nB\u03c0\nare determined around 0.3. With \u039b\u0304 \u2208 (0.50GeV, 0.60GeV ), we obtain F+,0\n(0) = 0.265 \u00b1\n\nB\u03c0\n0.032. This result is consistent with the extrapolated lattice QCD result F+,0\n(0) = 0.27 \u00b1\nB\u03c0\n0.11[1] and the newly obtained QCD LCSR result F+,0\n(0) = 0.258 \u00b1 0.031[5]. The PQCD\n\ncalculation are reliable only when the involved energy scale is hard enough. The lattice QCD\ncalculations which presently are available only for the soft regions, i.e. q 2 > 15GeV 2 .

The\nshaded band are our present results with the upper edge for \u039b\u0304 = 0.50GeV and the lower edge for\n\u039b\u0304 = 0.60GeV , respectively. The dashed and dotted lines stand for the QCD LCSR result Eq.(16)\nand the fits to the lattice QCD results with errors[3], respectively.\n2\nQCD LCSR can treat both hard and soft contributions with q 2 \u227a\n\u223c 18GeV [4, 5] on the same\n\nfooting. Therefore, the results from the PQCD approach, the lattice QCD approach and the\nQCD LCSRs are complementary to each other and by combining the results of those three\napproaches, one may obtain an understanding of the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in the\n\nwhole physical regions. The B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factors F+B\u03c0 (q 2 ) and F0B\u03c0 (q 2 ) derived\nfrom QCD LCSRs can be written in the following parameterization [5]:\nF+B\u03c0 (q 2 ) =\n\nr2\nr1\n,\n+\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 q /m1 1 \u2212 q 2 /m2fit\n\nF0B\u03c0 (q 2 ) =\n\nr3\n,\n1 \u2212 q 2 /m20fit\n\n(16)\n\nwhere r1 , r2 , r3 , m1 , mfit and m0fit are fitted parameters and can be taken as[5], r1 = 0.744,\nr2 = \u22120.486, r3 = 0.258, m1 = 5.32GeV , m2fit = 40.73GeV 2 and m20fit = 33.81GeV 2 .\nWith the parameterization Eq.(16), the QCD LCSR results can be extrapolated up to the\nupper limit of q 2 , i.e. q 2 \u223c 25GeV 2 , and then it can be treated as a bridge to connect\nboth the PQCD results and the lattice QCD results. In Fig.(6), we show the results of\nthe PQCD approach, the lattice QCD approach and the extrapolated QCD LCSR results\ndefined in Eq.(16), respectively. Our present PQCD results with \u039b\u0304 \u2208 (0.5GeV, 0.6GeV ) are\nin agreement and can match with the QCD LCSR results and the lattice QCD calculations,\nwhich are shown in Fig.(6).\n14\n\n\fIn summary, we have shown that the PQCD approach can be applied to calculate the\nB \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor in the large recoil regions. The twist-3 contributions are less\nthan the leading twist contribution with a better endpoint behavior twist-3 wavefunctions\nand both of the two wavefunctions \u03a8B and \u03a8\u0304B of the B meson are necessary to give a deep\nunderstanding of the B decays, e.g. B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form factor. Combining the PQCD\nresults with the QCD LCSR and the lattice QCD calculations, the B \u2192 \u03c0 transition form\nfactor can be determined in the whole kinematic regions.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank H.N.
