In confined systems like quantum dots with a discrete level spectrum an initial electron\nspin polarization will not decay exponentially, unless the\nspins are coupled to extra degrees of freedom like phonons\nor nuclear spins.1,2 For larger or open systems, where the\nenergy spectrum can be considered continuous, exponential decay is possible by purely elastic scattering which is\nthen the dominant process at low enough temperatures.\nIn this article we reconsider spin-relaxation in a twodimensional electron gas confined to a narrow channel,\nconcentrating on elastic scattering processes. Our study\nhas been motivated by a recent experiment, where the\nsize dependence of the spin relaxation time of an nInGaAs wire has been measured via Faraday rotation\nspectroscopy.3 The size dependence sets in when the\nwire width is of the order of several bulk spin relaxation lengths. The observed behavior is non-monotonic\nwith an initial increase followed by a sharp decrease at\nthe smallest wire widths. The maximum spin relaxation\ntime occurs when the width is of the order of the bulk\nspin relaxation length. Remarkably, while the tendency\nto suppress spin-relaxation in confined systems has been\npredicted in a number of theoretical works,4,5,6,7,8,9 there\nhas been no anticipation of the increase of the spin relaxation observed at the smallest widths. In this article\nwe show that spin active boundaries, not considered in\nthe previous theoretical analysis, dramatically change the\nsize dependence of the spin relaxation time in the small\nwidth limit and provide a useful point of view as far as\nthe interpretation of the experiment is concerned.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sec.\nII we recall the method of quasiclassical Green functions\nand point out when a diffusion equation approach is possible. In Sec. III we consider the spin dynamics in the\nbulk, whereas in Sec. IV we turn to spin relaxation in\nfinite systems. A summary is given in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE BASIC EQUATIONS\n\nWe start from the Hamiltonian of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas\nH=\n\np2\n+ b * \u03c3 + V (x),\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere b is the internal magnetic field due to the spinorbit coupling, \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices and\nV (x) is a delta-correlated random potential due to impurity scattering. For the internal field we concentrate\non the Rashba model, b = \u03b1 p \u00d7 ez , where the spinorbit field arises due to a structural inversion asymmetry. However, our treatment can be applied also to\nthe case of bulk inversion asymmetry, where there is\nin addition the Dresselhaus term10 which contributes\nto the two-dimensional effective Hamiltonian with b =\n\u03b2(px , \u2212py ) + \u03b3(px p2y , \u2212py p2x ), or to the case of a twodimensional hole gas, where the Rashba spin-orbit field\nhas a cubic dependence on momentum.11\nTo study the spin dynamics we rely on the method of\nthe quasiclassical Green function.12,13 The latter solves\nthe Eilenberger equation (~ = 1),\n1\n\u2202t g + vF * \u2207g + i[b * \u03c3, g] = \u2212 (g \u2212 hgi) ,\n\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the elastic scattering time, arising by the\nadoption of the standard self-consistent Born approximation for elastic impurity scattering. vF is the Fermi\nvelocity and h. . . i denotes the angular average over the\nFermi surface. Eq. (2) is valid in the limit when both\nthe spin-orbit energy and \u03c4 \u22121 are small compared to\nthe Fermi energy.14 Besides the space and time dependence implied by Eq. (2), the quasiclassical Green function g = gss\u2032 (\u01eb, v\u0302F ; x, t) is a matrix in spin space and\nis a function of energy \u01eb (measured with respect to the\nFermi surface) and direction on the Fermi surface, v\u0302F .15\nIn the absence of external potentials and magnetic fields\nthe particle and spin density are obtained by summing\n\n\f2\nover energy, angle and spin\nZ\nX\n1\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u2212 N0 d\u01eb\nhgss (\u01eb, v\u0302F ; x, t)i,\n(3)\n4\ns\nZ\nX1\n1\n\u03c3 ss\u2032 hgs\u2032 s (\u01eb, v\u0302F , x, t)i. (4)\ns(x, t) = \u2212 N0 d\u01eb\n4\n2\n\u2032\n\nwith L = 1 + \u03c4 \u2202t and a = 2\u03b1pF \u03c4 . Apparently the\nfull description of the spin dynamics now requires three\ntime constants for each component. The slowest decaying\ncomponent goes as si (t) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b3i t) with\n\u03b3x,y = 1/\u03c4s\n(a \u226a 1)\n\u03b3x,y = 1/2\u03c4\n(a \u226b 1)\n1\n1p\n\u03b3z =\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 4a2 ,\n2\u03c4\n2\u03c4\n\nss\n\nWhen the spin-orbit energy is small compared to the\nscattering rate the spin-dynamics becomes diffusive in\nthe low frequency, long wavelength limit. In this limit,\nall the harmonics characterizing the angle dependence of\ng can be expressed conveniently in terms of the s-wave\ncomponent. As a result the problem simplifies considerably and one obtains, for the angle averaged Green function, hgi, a diffusion equation, which, in the presence of\na general spin-orbit field, acquires the form given, for\ninstance, in Ref. 18. For the Rashba Hamiltonian in particular the equations read\n\u0001\n(5)\n\u2202t \u2212 D\u2202x2 \u03c1 = 0\n\u0001\n1\n(6)\n\u2202t \u2212 D\u2202x2 sx = \u2212 sx + 2C\u2202x sz\n\u03c4s\n\u0001\n1\n\u2202t \u2212 D\u2202x2 sy = \u2212 sy + 2C\u2202y sz\n(7)\n\u03c4s\n\u0001\n2\n\u2202t \u2212 D\u2202x2 sz = \u2212 sz \u2212 2C\u2202x sx \u2212 2C\u2202y sy , (8)\n\u03c4s\n\nwith D = 12 vF2 \u03c4 , \u03c4s = \u03c4 /[2(\u03b1pF \u03c4 )2 ], and C = vF \u03b1pF \u03c4 .\nSince here we focus on the spin dynamics, we limit ourselves to terms to leading order in the parameter \u03b1/vF ,\ntherefore neglecting spin-charge coupling14,16,17,18 .\nIII.\n\nSPIN DYNAMICS IN THE BULK\n\nThe spin-dynamics is particularly simple for a spatially\nhomogeneous spin density. From the diffusion equation\none observes that the different spin directions decouple\nand the spin polarization along the ex,y or ez axis relaxes with the time constant \u03c4s or \u03c4s /2, respectively. This\ntype of spin relaxation, known as the D'yakonov-Perel'\nmechanism,21 is easily understood: the electron spin precesses around the internal field b. Scattering from an\nimpurity changes the direction of the internal field, and\nthus randomizes the spin precession. If the precession\nangle, \u03b4\u03a6 \u223c |b|\u03c4 , between collisions is small, the spin\ndynamics resembles a diffusion. The total precession\nan\u221a\ngle after N scattering events is of the order N \u03b4\u03a6, from\nwhich the spin relaxation rate is estimated of the order\n\u03c4s \u223c \u03c4 /\u03b4\u03a62 \u223c \u03c4 /(\u03b1pF \u03c4 )2 .\nIn general we cannot rely on the diffusion equation but\nhave to solve Eq. (2). In the spatially homogeneous case\nthe task simplifies, since again different spin directions do\nnot couple. As a result, the spin dynamics is described\nby14\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nL(L2 + a2 ) \u2212 L2 \u2212 a2 sx,y = 0\n(9)\n2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(10)\nL(L2 + a2 ) \u2212 L2 sz = 0\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\ni.e. for a clean system all components decay on the time\nscale of the scattering time \u03c4 .\nFor conventional diffusion the mode with the longest\nlifetime is homogeneous in space. Here we encounter a\ndifferent situation, due to the coupling of the various spin\ncomponents. From the diffusion equation, for instance,\nthe modes with the longest lifetime are found to form an\nelliptically modulated spin spiral,\ns(x, t) \u221d [eq cos(q * x) + Aez sin(q * x)] exp(\u2212\u03b30 t), (14)\n2\nwhere the vector\n\u221a q lives in the x-y-plane with Dq =\n15/16\u03c4s, A = 3/ 15, and \u03b30 = 7/16\u03c4s . These long-living\nmodes have been investigated in [19] and in [20].\n\nIV.\n\nSPIN DYNAMICS IN FINITE SYSTEMS\n\nFor finite systems the equations have to be supplemented by boundary conditions.22,23,24 For specular scattering where an in-going trajectory is scattered into one\noutgoing direction the boundary condition for the Eilenberger equation reads24\nX\nout\ngss\nSss1 gsin1 s\u20321 Ss+\u2032 s\u2032 .\n(15)\n\u2032 =\n1\n\ns1 s\u20321\n\nThe unitary matrix S describes the surface scattering.\nBy decomposing the Green function in charge and spin\ncomponents, gss\u2032 = g0 \u03b4ss\u2032 + g * \u03c3 ss\u2032 , the boundary condition is equivalently expressed as\ng0out = g0in ,\n\ngout = R gin\n\n(16)\n\nwith an orthogonal matrix R that rotates the spin at\nthe surface. Charge conservation implies that no current\nflows through the boundary,\nhn * vF g0 i \u221d n * jc = 0,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere n is a vector normal to the boundary. For a spin\nconserving boundary (R = 1) also all components \u03b1 of\nthe spin current perpendicular to the surface are zero,\nhn * vF g\u03b1 i \u221d n * j\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nFor the general case, R 6= 1, Eq. (18) is not valid.\nIn the following we consider two types of boundary\nconditions. First we consider a spin-conserving boundary, where\n|kin si \u2192 |kout si,\n\n(19)\n\n\fsuch that S and R are unit matrices. As a second example we will consider a boundary that scatters adiabatically, i.e., an incoming wave in an eigenstate |kin \u00b1i of the\nHamiltonian (1) \u2013 not including disorder \u2013 is scattered\ninto the same band,\n(20)\n\nas it is expected for a smooth confining potential.25,26\nSince the eigenstates in the presence of the field b are\nspin-polarized parallel to b, the adiabatic boundary implies a rotation of the spin polarization, S = ei\u03c3z \u03c6 , where\n\u03c6 is the angle between the electron momentum and the\nnormal of the interface.\nBefore presenting our numerical results for the spin relaxation obtained by solving Eq. (2), it is useful to derive\nthe boundary conditions in the diffusive regime. The idea\nis to solve the Eilenberger equation near the boundary assuming that the angular average of g varies only slowly\non the scale of the mean free path, l. This is justified\nwhen the spin relaxation length Ls is much longer than\nl.

Recall that the smallest\neigenvalue for a bulk system is \u03b30 = 7/16\u03c4s . The modes\nwith smaller decay rate have a complex wave vector and\nare thus localized near the edges of the wire.

In the presence of both a Rashba and a\nDresselhaus term, the spin is still conserved for one direction which depends on the relative strength of the two\nterms: Perpendicular to the boundary when the Rashba\nterm dominates, parallel to the boundary when the Dresselhaus term is larger, and somewhere in between (but always in-plane) when both terms are comparable in size.\nThe above results change considerably when different\nboundary conditions are applied. Fig. 3 shows the time\nevolution of a spin polarization using adiabatic boundary\nconditions, Eq. (26). Here the spin has been prepared in\nx-direction, i.e. perpendicular to the boundary. In this\ncase the boundary mode is absent, and the asymptotic\ndecay of the spin polarization is ruled by an inhomogeneous, but extended mode. The spectrum of the spin\ndiffusion operator is shown in Fig. 4. The boundary condition implies that the eigenmodes are sx,y \u221d sin(qx),\nsz \u221d cos(qx) with q = n\u03c0/L; the eigenvalues are given\nby\n\u03b3(q) = Dq 2 +\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n(31)\n\nwhich allows to reproduce the spin diffusion equation,\nEqs.

For a quantum dot, i.e. a system that is confined in all spatial directions, the vanishing of the spin\ncurrent through the boundaries then implies immediately\nthat \u2202t s = 0. For a narrow wire the situation becomes\nslightly more complicated since only currents flowing into\nthe boundary are zero, which after some algebra leads to\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03b2 \u03b1\u03b2\n0\nsx\n1 1 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed sy \uf8f8 .\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b12\n0\n\u2202t s = \u2212\n\u03c4s \u03b12\nsz\n0 0 \u03b12 + \u03b2 2\n\n0.1\n\n\u03b3\u03c4s\n\nj\u03b1\u03b2\n\n1\n\n|sx |\n\nThis effect can be traced back to the specific form of\nthe spin-orbit field in the Rashba Hamiltonian \u2013 being\nproportional to the velocity.6 Here we formulate the argument for a system including Rashba and also linear\nDresselhaus term within the spin-diffusion equation approach.

In contrast to the previous case of\na spin-conserving boundary, here all the diffusion modes\nshow an increasing spin relaxation rate at the smallest\nwire widths. In particular, all the modes show a non\nmonotonous behavior as a function\nof the wire width with\n\u221a\na minimum at L/Ls = (4\u03c0/ 15) n \u2248 3 n, where n is the\nmode index. For width L < Ls all spin diffusion modes\nrelax fast.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMotivated by a recent experiment3 we studied spin relaxation in narrow wires with spin-orbit coupling. To\nthis end we have solved the Eilenberger equation and\nthe spin diffusion equation in the presence of spin-orbit\ninteraction14 supplemented by boundary conditions for\nboth charge and spin degrees of freedom assuming translational invariance along the wire.\nThe spin diffusion equation has extra, off-diagonal gradient terms that couple the different spin directions. Due\nto these terms there exist inhomogeneous spin-profiles,\ntypically spin-spirals, that decay slower than a homogeneous spin configuration and that show up close to the\nedges of the wire. Therefore there is a tendency for the\n\n\f5\nspin relaxation to slow down, the stronger the influence\nof the boundary becomes, i.e. when decreasing the width\nof the wire.\nFor very narrow wires, i.e. narrower than the spin relaxation length, the spin relaxation rate depends crucially\non the boundary condition and on the form of the spinorbit coupling. For models with linear-in-momentum\nspin orbit field and spin-conserving boundaries the spin\nrelaxation rate goes to zero with the system size.
