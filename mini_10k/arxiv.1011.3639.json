In\nthis work, direct coupling between the motional\ndipoles of separately trapped ions is achieved over\na distance of 54 \u03bcm, using the dipole-dipole interaction as a quantum-mechanical transmission\nline[11]. This interaction is small between single trapped ions, but the coupling is amplified by\nusing additional trapped ions as antennae.

The dipole-dipole interaction offers a link between separate quantum systems\nwithout the need to shuttle particles between sites.

As the dipole-dipole\ninteraction decreases rapidly with trap separation, it is\nadvantageous to bring the trapping wells as close together\nas possible. However, the generation of small inter-well\ndistances requires similarly small distances, d, between\nthe ions and the trap electrodes. This requirement runs\ncounter to the effort to keep a larger ion-electrode separation in order to reduce \"anomalous heating\"[13, 14] with\nits d\u22124 scaling, and also the effects of technical noise of\nthe applied voltages[15]. Various routes may be taken to\nbalance these competing requirements. In one approach,\nthe heating rate may be reduced through the use of cryogenic temperatures[16]. Here, another approach is taken\nthat uses more ions in the individual traps and enables interaction over larger distances. The additional ions work\nas \"antennae\" that increase the motional dipole moment\nat the respective trapping site.\nGiven longitudinal alignment of the traps with one par-\n\n\f2\nticle in each well, the dipole-dipole interaction (Eq. 1) is:\n10\n\n(2)\n\n8\n\n\u3008n1\u3009\n\nUdd\n\nq1 q2 \u2206z1 \u2206z2\n=\u2212\n2\u03c0\u000f0\nr3\n\u03a9c\n= \u2212~ (a1 + a\u20201 )(a2 + a\u20202 )\n2\n\u0011\n\u03a9c \u0010\n\u2248 \u2212~\na1 a\u20202 + a\u20201 a2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwith\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nq1 q2\n1\n\u03a9c =\n.\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u000f0 m1 m2 \u03c91 \u03c92 r3\n\n(4)\n\nHere qi and q\nmi refer to the charge and mass of the particles, \u2206zi = (2m~i \u03c9i ) (ai +a\u2020i ) denotes the vibrational amplitude of the motion of ion i. The quantum-mechanical\ncreation and annihilation operators, ai and a\u2020i act on\nthe individual harmonic oscillators with frequencies \u03c9i .\nRapidly oscillating terms have been neglected in Eq. 3.\nAt resonance, i. e. for \u03c91 = \u03c92 , the coupling described\nby Eq. (3) leads to a complete exchange of motional states\nbetween the two ions after time Tswap = \u03c0/\u03a9c . This is\nanalogous to two coupled pendula connected by a (massless) spring. If one pendulum initially oscillates while\nthe other is at rest, the motion is periodically exchanged\nbetween them. The first pendulum comes to a complete\nstop after a characteristic time, Tswap , proportional to\nthe associated spring constant. A quantum-mechanical\ndescription may be given using the vibrational quanta,\nni , often labelled \"phonons\", in the individual wells. Under the dipole-dipole interaction an initial motional state\n|n1 , n2 i becomes entangled with all other motional states\n|n01 , n02 i respecting n01 + n02 = n1 + n2 . Only at odd (even)\nmultiples of Tswap is the swapped (original) basis state recovered. Notably, the initial\n\u221a state |0, 1i evolves into the\nBell-state (|0, 1i + |1, 0i)/ 2 after time Tswap /2, yielding\na maximally entangled state of motion. This motional entanglement can be mapped on to the internal electronic\nstate of the ions[17].\nIn the experiment presented the coherent energy exchange is demonstrated between singly charged 40 Ca+\nions. They are held in an ion trap with gold-on-alumina\nelectrodes arranged in a two-layer geometry (cf. Fig. 1)\nsimilar to the one described in Ref. 18. Applying DC\nvoltages of up to 110 V to seven adjacent electrode pairs,\na double-well potential with a trap separation of 54 \u03bcm\nand trap frequencies of 537 kHz is created (see Methods). The ions are Doppler-cooled on the S1/2 -P1/2 transition at 397 nm using a single, elliptically shaped laser\nbeam, and detected by collecting the fluorescence light\non an EM-CCD camera and on a photo-multiplier tube.\nTwo 729 nm laser beams, individually focused on the\ntwo trapping sites, are used to perform sideband cooling on the S1/2 -D5/2 transition and to map out the sideband spectrum[19]. During the 4 ms period of sideband\ncooling the 729 nm beam is alternated between the two\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\u03c4 (ms)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2. Energy exchange between two trapped ions over a\ndistance of 54 \u03bcm. The data show the average number of\nphonons in the first trapping well, hn1 i, after sideband cooling and a variable waiting time, \u03c4 . The sequence for sideband\ncooling has been arranged to yield different phonon numbers\nin the two wells, revealing the state exchange as an oscillation\nof phonon numbers at the level of a few quanta. The observed\ntime for a complete exchange is Tswap = 222(10) \u03bcs, indicating a mode splitting of \u03a9c \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 2.25(4) kHz. A damping\nconstant \u03c4damp =3(2) ms and a constant background heating\nof 1.3(7) quanta per millisecond are inferred from the fit to\nthe data. The error bars indicate one standard deviation as\ninferred from Monte Carlo simulations. Lateral deviations\nof the data from the fit are attributed to small drifts in the\nresonance condition which modify the exchange rate.\n\ntrapping sites at the approximate rate of the energy exchange, leading to an imbalance of phonon population\nbetween the traps. Immediately following the cooling\ncycle a mean phonon number hn1 i = 3.9(4) is observed\nin the first well, by comparing Rabi-flops on the redand blue-sideband[19]. Fig. 2 shows the oscillatory behaviour of the phonon number in this well as a function of waiting time. The theoretical fit to the data indicates an exchange within Tswap = 222(10) \u03bcs and an\ninitial phonon population of hn2 i = 9(1) in the second\nwell. Currently, the ions experience a heating rate of\n1.3(7) quanta per millisecond, which is comparable to\nother room-temperature traps[20].\nIdeally, the exchange rate would be significantly larger\nthan the average heating rate. To enhance the exchange\nrate strings of several ions can be used in the trapping wells. Approximating the individual ion strings\nas point-like objects with appropriately increased charge\nand mass, the resulting dipoles scale with the square root\nof the number of ions (see Eq. 4), leading to an overall\nincrease of the interaction rate proportional to the total\nnumber of ions. Using lighter ion species for antennae\nwould enhance the coupling even more.\nThis increase is demonstrated by mapping out the ions'\nexcitation spectrum as the trapping frequencies of the\nindividual sites are scanned through the resonance con-\n\n\f3\n490\n\n(a)\n\n550\nf0\n\n(b)\n\n525\n550\n\n470\n\n(b)\n\nf\n\n0\n\n460\n\n525\n\n450\n\n500\n\nfax (kHz)\n\nf\n\nax\n\n(kHz)\n\n480\n\n(a)\n\n440\n\u221250\n\n\u221225\n\n0\nUax (mV)\n\n25\n\n50 0\n\n0.5\nexcitation\n\n1\n\n475\n\n450\n\nFIG. 3.

The dipole-dipole coupling manifests as an avoided\ncrossing, separating the mode frequencies by \u03a9c . Close to\nresonance, the motion of the ion strings is strongly coupled, and the oscillation can be excited with 729 nm light\non either of the two trapping sites[19]. Fig. 3 (a) shows\nan example of this avoided crossing measured with two\nions in each well while Fig. 3 (b) represents an individual\nsideband spectrum. The motional spectra of five ion configurations have been analyzed, using up to three ions in\neach well. The configurations and corresponding mode\nspectra are displayed in Fig. 4. The curves present calculations using a common set of fit parameters for the\npotential and for the action of the control voltage Uax\n(see Methods). For the configuration with one ion per\nwell, the observed splitting of 1.9 kHz agrees within one\nstandard deviation with the energy-exchange rate from\nFig. 2, which was measured with the same trap parameters. The data further show that the splitting is increased\nfrom 1.9(3) kHz to 14(1) kHz by using up to three ions in\neach well, without any modification of the external potential. The seven-fold increase of the coupling is beyond the\nfactor three that is expected from a simple point-charge\nmodel and is due to the anharmonicity of the individual\npotential wells: as the outer potential walls are steeper\nthan the inner ones, the ion-strings' centers of mass get\ncloser as more ions are added. At the same time, the average oscillation frequency is reduced. Both of these effects\nlead to an increase in the coupling strength (see Eq. 4).\nThe extent of the ion strings provides an additional increase when it becomes non-negligible with respect to the\ninter-well distance.\nThe demonstrated coupling[21] can be used in diverse\nschemes to create entanglement or to perform gates.

The lines represent predictions from numerical calculations and fit all data simultaneously. A small drift in the control voltage of 7 mV over one\nhour has been taken into account, aligning the spectra on top\nof one another. By the use of three ions in each potential\nwell the coupling is increased from 1.9(3) kHz to 14(1) kHz\n(see text). The vertical elongation of the ion pictures is due\nto abberations, arising from an off-axis position of the ions\nrelative to the imaging axis.\n\nground state cooling of the ions. One route to perform\na thermally robust quantum gate has been described by\nCirac et al.[11], however it requires a state-dependent\npushing force by an appropriate laser. It should be noted\nthat a fast variant[22] of the thermally robust M\u00f8lmerS\u00f8rensen gate[23] which uses bichromatic laser beams can\nalso be implemented in a dipole-dipole coupled system\nbetween different trapping sites. If the laser frequencies\nare tuned to the mid-points of the red and blue sideband\npairs, a gate can be performed within Tgate = 4\u03c0/\u03a9c .\nThe new coupling scheme also has a great impact on\npossible architectures for quantum computation. It is\nstraight forward to imagine a linear array of ion traps,\neach holding a string of ions. Moreover, the coupling\nof parallel dipoles differs from longitudinal coupling by\nonly a factor of p\n\u22121/2, while under the quadrupole angle\nof \u03b8q = arccos( 1/3) the coupling vanishes. Considering oscillations along the trap axis, a two-dimensional\narray of traps may thus be realized, where unwanted\ncoupling to nearest diagonal neighbours is suppressed.\nBringing rows of traps pairwise into resonance allows the\n\n\f4\ncreation of linear cluster states within two steps. A twodimensional cluster state would only require two further\nsteps by pairwise coupling of columns[24].\nThe amplification of the dipole-dipole interaction is not\nlimited to ions. The presented technique may be directly transferred to the coupling of trapped Rydberg\natoms[25]. Furthermore, atomic and ionic systems may\nbe combined. Neutral atoms have already been brought\nclose to ions[26, 27]. When the ions' oscillation frequency\nis tuned into resonance with adjacent levels of a Rydberg\natom, coupling between ions and Rydberg atoms may\nbecome achievable.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Hartmut H\u00e4ffner for fruitful discussions at an\nearly state of the project.

The outermost electrode pairs are used to compensate for the asymmetry\ninduced by the taper zone. The control voltage, Uax , is\nadditionally applied to the leftmost electrode pair, creating a nearly-homogeneous electric field in the center region. This shifts the trap frequencies of the two wells in\nopposite directions and is used to tune the wells into and\nout of resonance. In the region of interest the double-well\npotential is well described by a fourth-order polynomial,\nwhere the 0th order term does not influence the dynamics and the third-order coefficient has been eliminated by\nappropriate choice of origin:\nUpot (z) = \u03b11 * z + \u03b12 * z 2 + \u03b14 * z 4 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe polynomial coefficients \u03b12 and \u03b14 determine both\nthe uncoupled trap frequency, \u03c90 , and the inter-well separation, r, at the symmetry point[28] (\u03b11 = 0). For the\ntheoretical calculations, the action of the tuning voltage\nis modelled as a linear contribution to the coefficients\n\u03b11 = 4.61 \u00d7 10\u221224 m\u22121 and \u03b12 = 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221220 m\u22122 .
