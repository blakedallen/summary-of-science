It has therefore been suggested that \u03b2 Cep and SPB\nstars should be rare in the Magellanic Clouds which have lower metallicities than the\nsolar neighborhood. To test this prediction we have observed the open SMC cluster\nNGC 371 for 12 nights in order to search for \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars. Surprisingly, we\nfind 29 short-period B-type variables in the upper part of the main sequence, many\nof which are probably SPB stars. This result indicates that pulsation is still driven\nby the \u03ba mechanism even in low metallicity environments. All the identified variables\nhave periods longer than the fundamental radial period which means that they cannot\nbe \u03b2 Cep stars. Within an amplitude detection limit of 5 mmag no stars in the top\nof the HR-diagram show variability with periods shorter than the fundamental radial\nperiod. So if \u03b2 Cep stars are present in the cluster they oscillate with amplitudes below\n5 mmag, which is significantly lower than the mean amplitude of \u03b2 Cep stars in the\nGalaxy. We see evidence that multimode pulsation is more common in the upper part\nof the main sequence than in the lower. We have also identified 5 eclipsing binaries\nand 3 periodic pulsating Be stars in the cluster field.\nKey words: star: early-type - stars: oscillations (including pulsations) - galaxies:\nMagellanic Clouds\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\u03b2 Cep and slowly pulsating B stars (SPB) pulsate due\nto the \u03ba-mechanism activated by the metal opacity bump\n(Cox et al. 1992). This give rise to p-mode pulsation in \u03b2\nCep stars and g-mode pulsation in SPB stars. However the\ntheoretical standard models do not predict the presence of\npulsation in \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars in low-metallicity environments such as the Magellanic Clouds.\nAnalysis of OGLE data have indeed shown that\n\u03b2 Cep and SPB stars exist in the Magellanic Clouds\n(Pigulski & Kolaczkowski 2002; Kolaczkowski et al. 2004,\n2006) though it is not clear if the rate of \u03b2 Cep and SPB\nstars is lower than or equal to the rate in the Galaxy. We\nhave therefore observed the open SMC cluster NGC 371 for\n12 nights in order to search for \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars. Observing a single cluster instead of the the entire SMC has\na number of advantages, \u2013 e.g. the age and metallicity of\nthe cluster can be constrained from fitting isochrones to the\nHR-diagram.\nThe metallicity of the SMC has been measured to be-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: karoff@phys.au.dk\n\ntween Z = 0.001 and Z = 0.004 (see Maeder et al. 1999,\nand references therein), while Miglio et al. (2007a,b) have\ncalculated instability domains of \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars using improved opacities and metal abundances which do not\npredict pulsation in \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars for Z < 0.005. We\nshould therefore not expect to find any \u03b2 Cep or SPB stars\nin the SMC.\nIn order to test this prediction we have chosen to observe the cluster NGC 371 as this cluster has been observed\nbefore by Kjeldsen & Baade (1994) who saw some signs of\nvariability, though no clear evidence of pulsation was seen.\nThe observations presented in this paper have been\nmade with a single telescope. This means that clear mode\nand frequency determination can not be obtained and the\nfrequencies can not be used for modeling. Instead this work\npresents a number of candidate SPB stars for followup observations with at least dual-side photometry and with spectroscopy.\nThe paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 presents\nthe cluster. Section 3 describes how we obtained, reduced\nand analyzed the data. The identified eclipsing binaries are\npresented in Section 4, the Be stars in Section 5 and the\npulsating stars in the upper part of the main sequence in\n\n\f2\n\nKaroff et al.\n\nFigure 2. Light curves of one of the bright stars in NGC 371\nshowing the precision level and data sampling.\n\nFigure 1. DFOSC image of NGC371, with the variables marked.\n\nSection 6. A summary and concluding remarks are found in\nSection 7.\n\n2\n\nTHE TARGET CLUSTER: NGC 371\n\nNGC 371 (\u03b12000 , \u03b42000 = 11h 03m 25.s 0,\u221272\u25e6 04\u2032 40.\u2032\u2032 0) is a\nyoung open cluster in the SMC. Wisniewski & Bjorkman\n(2006) estimated a log(age) of 6.7 based on isochrone fitting\nto OGLE data assuming a metallicity of Z = 0.002. As there\nare no high-resolution spectra available for NGC 371 it has\nnot been possible to estimate the metallicity autonomously.\nThe field of the cluster is shown in Fig. 1 with the identified variable stars marked.\n\n3\n\nBIAS and the flat-fields were indeed stable over the length\nof the observing run.\nThe photometric reductions were done using the software package MOMF (Kjeldsen & Frandsen 1992). MOMF\napplies a very robust algorithm combining PSF and aperture\nphotometry in semi-crowded fields.\nSome of the light curves showed residuals of systematic\ntrends caused by, e.g., air mass, cloud cover, and temperature variations (these residuals are sometimes referred to as\n\"red noise\"). We therefore applied the algorithm introduced\nby Tamuz et al. (2005) in order to correct for systematic effects. This clearly improved the rms noise level, in particular\nin the brightest stars.\nThe resulting light curves had rms noise levels over the\nwhole observing run ranging from a few mmag in the bright\nend and up to 50 mmag in the faint end. Some of the light\ncurves showed night-to-night drifts, which means that the\nrms noise level in the individual nights was lower than over\nthe whole observing run. Fig. 2 shows the precision in a\ntypical bright star.\n\nTHE DATA AND THE DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations were obtained with the DFOSC instrument at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at ESO, La Silla during\n12 nights in August and September 2005. 763 frames were\ncollected in I and 623 in B. The same pointing was maintained during the observations, i.e., the stars were kept at\nfixed positions on the CCD (within a few pixels) during the\nobserving run. Because of the crowding in the field the observations were always made in focus and the exposure times\nwere then adjusted according to the seeing so that only the\nbrightest 5 % of the stars were saturated. This resulted in\nexposure times of approximately 20 s in I and 60 s in B. In\nFig. 2 all the data are shown for one of the bright stars in\nNGC 371, illustrating the time distribution of the data set.\nThe CCD images were calibrated using standard procedures, i.e. a master BIAS was subtracted from each frame\nbefore the frames were divided by a master sky-flat in each\nfilter. The master BIAS was obtained from a large number of frames from the whole observing run and the master\nsky-flats were obtained as the median of a large number of\nevening and morning sky-flats. We checked that both the\n\n3.1\n\nAnalysis of differential light curves\n\nWe obtained differential light curves of 6842 stars in the 13.5'\n\u00d7 13.5' FOV and we searched for variability in all these light\ncurves. The light curves were kept in the instrumental system, but calibrated U BV I photometry was obtained from\nZaritsky et al. (2002).\nWe used two complementary algorithms to search\nfor variability; the analysis of variance periodograms\n(Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996) and simultaneous iterative\nsine wave fitting (Frandsen et al. 1995) based on the Lomb\nperiodogram (Lomb 1976). We searched for variability both\nwith and without using statistical weights (Frandsen et al.\n1995). The statistical weights were assigned as the standard\ndeviation of all data points separated by less than 15 minutes from a given data point. For the analysis of variance\napproach we made visual examination of all light curves\nwhich had fit qualities better than 0.9 and for the Lomb\nperiodogram approach we made visual examination of all\nlight curves where the same peak in the periodogram was\npresent in both B and I with a S/N higher than 4 in ampli-\n\n\fSPB stars in NGC 371\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Phase light curves of the 5 eclipsing binaries identified\nin NGC 371\n\ntude (Breger et al. 1993). In total we ended up with a list\nof a little over a hundred stars that were selected for further\nanalysis.\nIn the visual examination, stars were rejected mainly\nbecause of one of the following three causes: stars were\nplaced outside the cluster region, stars were placed close\nto a hot pixel or a bad column, or the variability was not\nthe same in the two filters. This gave us the list of the 37\nstars presented in this paper. Light curves of all the variable\nstars will be added to CDS.\nIt is not possible to determine if a star is a true cluster member or not, as we only have two dimensional images\navailable. To determine if a star is likely to be a true cluster member in three dimension a spectroscopic analysis is\nneeded. Therefore we can not give a reliable estimate of the\nnumber of cluster members and some of the identified variable stars could turn out not to be clusters members.\n\nID\n\nID II\n\nV6\nV7\nV8\n\nWBBe 43\nWBBe 110\nWBBe 18\n\n\u03b12000\n\n\u03b42000\n\nB\n\nB\u2013I\n\n01 03 34.5\n01 03 30.5\n01 03 52.6\n\n-72 06 42\n-72 03 46\n-72 05 39\n\n16.65\n17.99\n15.73\n\n0.35\n-0.34\n0.21\n\nECLIPSING BINARIES\n\nWe have detected 5 eclipsing binaries (phased light curves\nare shown in Fig. 3). V1, V2 and V3 are located on the\nedge of the cluster, which means that they might not be\ncluster members. V4 and V5 are located safely inside the\ncluster and these stars could be important in determining\nthe precise distance and age of the cluster. This information\nwill again be important when trying to model the excitation\nmechanisms of \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars based on data from this\ncluster.\nV2 also shows some signs of pulsation with a frequency\nof 6.2 c/d, which suggest that this could be a binary system with one of the members being a pulsating star. But\nmore photometry will be needed in order to evaluate the\nphenomenon properly, \u2013 i.e removing the eclipse from the\nlight curve before analyzing the pulsation.\n\n5\n\nBE STARS\n\nThree of the detected variable stars match with the stars\nidentified as Be stars by Wisniewski & Bjorkman (2006).\nThey have identified 118 Be stars and 11 candidate Be stars\nin NGC371 based on two-color diagrams of B, V , R and H\u03b1\nphotometry. Though the nature of the variability of Be stars\nis believed to be transient, Be stars might also exhibit g- or\np-mode pulsation. It is therefore clear that these three stars\ncan be used to gain understanding of the relation between\ng- and p-mode pulsation and the variability of Be stars in\nlow-metallically environments. The amplitude spectra of the\nthree Be stars are shown in Fig. 4. The light curves of the\nthree Be stars all show coherent variability, which indicate\nthat the variability originates from pulsation and not from\ntransient events like activity.\n\n\f4\n\nKaroff et al.\n\nFigure 4. Amplitude spectra for 3 Be stars in NGC371. Note\nthat the scale on the y-axis is different for the three stars.\n\n6\n\nFigure 5. Amplitude spectra for three pulsating stars in the\nupper part of the main sequence of NGC 371\n\nPULSATING STARS IN THE UPPER PART\nOF THE MAIN SEQUENCE\n\nThe frequency analysis of the variable stars in the upper\npart of the main sequence followed Arentoft et al. (2007).\nThis means that we made a simultaneous least-squares fit\nto all the frequencies with a S/N higher than 4 in the amplitude spectra of both the I and the B filter data. For\neach frequency we manually inspected the amplitude spectra, in order to find the frequency value that best described\nthe variation in both filters. This step could not be made\ncompletely objective as daily aliases were present in the amplitude spectra because the observations were made from a\nsingle site. Therefore some of the detected frequencies might\nbe shifted 1\u20132 c/d from the true oscillation frequencies. The\nuncertainties on the amplitudes and phases were calculated\nbased on the error matrix in the least-squares fitting procedure, though we also used Monte Carlo simulations to check\nthe consistency of these uncertainties [this was done with\nthe use of Period04 (Lenz & Breger 2005)]. This procedure\nfor calculating the uncertainties assumes that we know the\nfrequencies, \u2013 i.e. that we know which peak reflect the oscillation mode. The calculated uncertainties does therefore not\nreflect the uncertainty originating from mismatch between\nthe true oscillation mode and the daily aliases.\nAll the detected frequencies for the pulsating stars are\ngiven in Table 3 together with color, amplitude and phase\ninformation, three examples of amplitude spectra of pulsating stars are shown in Fig. 5 and phased light curves are\nshown in Fig. 6.\n\nFigure 6.

(2002) to\nmake a B versus B \u2212 I color-magnitude-diagram of NGC\n371 as shown in Fig. 7. The center of the cluster was placed\non \u03b12000 , \u03b42000 = 11h 03m 25.s 0,\u221272\u25e6 04\u2032 40.\u2032\u2032 0 and the size was\nselected as a circle with a radius of 5'. The color-magnitudediagram shows the upper part of the main sequence, which\nis almost vertical, and the giant branch. All the identified\nvariable stars which are not eclipsing binaries or Be stars\nare located on the upper part of the main sequence, which\nis also where the instability strips for \u03b2 Cep and SPB stars\nwould be located if the metallicity of the cluster had been\nlarger. Instability analysis of models of hot main sequence\nstars of solar metallicity show a group of mostly p-mode\npulsators where the longest period is the fundamental radial\nmode and a second group of cooler stars with mostly gmodes and longer periods. The first group can be identified\nwith the classical \u03b2 Cep stars (early B-type stars) while the\nsecond group can be identified with the SPB stars (mid B-\n\ntype stars). Models based on revised solar metal abundances\nand different opacities show that the hot boundary of the\nSPB instability strip overlaps with the \u03b2 Cep instability\nstrip (Miglio et al. 2007a,b). At the metallicity of NGC 371,\nhowever, no pulsations are excited in the models as already\nmentioned. Therefore theory cannot be used as a guide in\nclassification. We will come back to this in the next section.\nWe have used the Padova evolutionary code described\nin Marigo et al. (2007) to calculate an isochrone for the\ncolor-magnitude-diagram of the cluster. The model used solar heavy elements mixture. We adopted a metalicity of\nZ=0.002 and a log(age) of 6.7 from Wisniewski & Bjorkman\n(2006). The distance modulus was chosen to 18.7 from\nCrowl et al. (2001) and the reddening to E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.085\n(Larsen et al. 2000).\nThe isochrone is plotted on top of the color-magnitudediagram in Fig. 7. Here it is seen that the isochrone generally\nfits the data nicely.\n\n\f6\n\nKaroff et al.\n\nFigure 7. Color-magnitude-diagram of NGC 371 with the identified SPB candidates marked. The solid line shows a isochrone\nfit to the observations.\n\n6.2\n\nFigure 8. Magnitude-period relation for the candidate SPB\nstars stars together with the fundamental radial period from the\nisochrone. The mode with the longest period in each star is plotted with large crosses, while the secondary modes with shorter\nperiods is plotted with small diamonds.\n\nPeriod distribution in NGC 371\n\nIn the Galaxy, \u03b2 Cephei stars have periods which are consistent with mostly p-mode pulsations. The longest period\nis that of the fundamental radial mode for which the pulsation constant Q \u2248 0.033 d\u22121 (Stankov & Handler 2005). To\nclassify stars in NGC 371 we need an estimate of Q for each\nstar:\nlog Q = log P + 1/2 log(M/M\u2299 ) \u2212 3/4 log(L/L\u2299 )\n+3 log(T /T\u2299 ).\nwhere P is the period in days, M the mass, L the luminosity and T the effective temperature. Since we do not have\ndata to estimate the masses, luminosities and effective temperatures for individual stars, we use these values of the\nisochrone shown in Fig. 7. The result is shown in Fig. 8\ntogether with all the identified periods as a function of B\nmagnitude. There the mode with the longest period in each\nstar is plotted with large crosses, while the secondary modes\nwith shorter periods are plotted with small diamonds.\nIn Fig. 8 it is seen that all stars have periods that are\nlonger than the fundamental radial periods. We therefore\nidentify all the stars as candidate SPB stars. Classification\nof the stars as bona fide SPB stars would require more time\nseries observations to ensure that the periods are correct and\nexclude other sources of variability, such as close binaries.\nIf there are \u03b2 Cep stars in the cluster then we can\nassume two things about them; That they are generally\nbrighter than the SPB stars and that they have periods\nshorter than the fundamental radial period. We do not detect any pulsating stars in this domain than fulfill the detection criteria given in Section 3.1 and therefore we do not\ndetect any candidate \u03b2 Cep stars in NGC 371.\nIn order to constrain an upper detection limit of \u03b2 Cep\nstars in the cluster we measured the highest peak in the\namplitude spectrum between 8 and 20 c/d for all the stars\nbrighter than 15.8 in B. A frequency range from 8 to 20\nc/d is in agreement with the frequency range in which the\n\u03b2 Cep stars are expected for this cluster (see Fig. 8). For\nthe brightest stars we could also have included periods up\nto 0.4 day, but this gave problems with the 1/f noise in the\namplitude spectra of some of the stars.\nIn Fig. 9 we have plotted the amplitude of the high-\n\nest peaks as a function of magnitude together with the\nmean V oscillation amplitude of galactic \u03b2 Cep stars from\nStankov & Handler (2005). It is seen that our detection limit\nis significantly lower than the mean V oscillation amplitude\nof galactic \u03b2 Cep. If \u03b2 Cep stars are present in the cluster\nthey have oscillation amplitudes significantly lower than the\ngalactic \u03b2 Cep stars.\nThough we do not detect any candidate \u03b2 Cep stars\nsome of the stars do show variability between 8 and 20 c/d,\nbut not with a S/N higher than 4 in both filters. In Fig. 9 we\nhave marked the peaks which have S/N higher than 3.5 in\nB and in Fig. 10 we have plotted the amplitude spectrum of\none of them. The detection criteria of S/N higher than 4 in\nboth filters is generally conservative and for longer regularly\nsampled data sets it is too high as the observations in the\ntwo filters are independent. But for the present data set it\nseems as a good indication of pulsation. More photometric\ndata is needed in order to classify these stars as candidate \u03b2\nCep stars. On the other hand if these stars are \u03b2 Cep stars\nthey would be very interesting targets as they would have\nshorter periods and lower oscillation amplitudes compared\nto the galactic \u03b2 Cep stars.\nThough periods below 0.1 day are not common in \u03b2 Cep\nstars they have been seen in the very young cluster NGC\n6231 (Balona & Shobbrook 1983; Arentoft et al. 2001).\n6.3\n\nAmplitude ratio and phase difference\n\nWe have also calculated and plotted the amplitude ratios\nand phase difference between the B and I filters (Fig. 11) in\norder to identify any systematic effects that could be compared with theoretical models as in Arentoft et al. (2007)\nor used for mode identification (Heynderickx et al. 1994).\nThough we do not find any systematic effects in phase\ndifference versus amplitude ratio within the uncertainties\n(Fig. 11) we do see that the main part of the observed frequencies cluster around an amplitude ratio between 0.5 and\n1.0 which is expected for oscillations in \u03b2 Cep stars with\ndegrees between 0 and 2 (Heynderickx et al. 1994).\nThe I/B amplitude ratio can also be used to exclude\nother causes of the variability than pulsation (e.g. ellipsoidal\n\n\fSPB stars in NGC 371\n\nFigure 9. Amplitudes of the highest peak as a function of magnitude for the stars brighter than the identified candidate SPB\nstars. The diamonds mark the peaks with a S/N higher than 3.5.\nThe horizontal line at 17 mmag shows the mean oscillation amplitude of \u03b2 Cep stars in the Galaxy inV . The arrow marks the\nstar plotted in Fig. 10.\n\nvariables) as the I/B amplitude ratios are general below\nunity (see, e.g., Arentoft et al. 2007, and references therein).\n6.4\n\nFigure 10. Amplitude spectrum in B of one of the stars showing\nsigns of \u03b2 Cep variability between 8 and 20 c/d with a S/N below\n4.\n\nwere previously identified as Be stars. These stars can used\nto study the relation between the Be phenomenon and \u03b2\nCep and SPB stars in low-metallicity environments.\nThe results presented here strongly confirm and increase\nour interest in NGC 371 as an excellent laboratory for \u03b2 Cep\nand SPB stars.\n\nMultimode pulsation\n\nThe last thing to note about the frequencies is that all the\nmultimode pulsators are found among the pulsating stars\nin the upper part of the main sequence (except for one).\nOne reason for this could be that these stars are brighter,\nwhich in general gives a higher S/N, but some of the frequencies that we detect in the stars in the lower part of the\nmain sequence have such a high amplitude that multimode\npulsation should have been discovered if it was present (see\nTable 3).\n\n7\n\n7\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have identified 5 eclipsing binaries, 3 periodic Be stars\nand 29 candidate SPB stars in NGC371.\nThe results indicates that excitation of oscillations in\nSPB stars is more common in low metallicity environments\nsuch as the SMC than predicted by standard stellar models. As a possible extension to the standard stellar models\nto account for this discrepancy could be to include local\niron enhancement by diffusion and radiative accelerations\n(Miglio et al. 2007c).\nIf there are \u03b2 Cep stars in the cluster they would generally be brighter than the SPB stars and have periods shorter\nthan the fundamental radial period and we do not detect\npulsation in any stars in this domain with an upper limit on\nthe oscillation amplitudes of 5 mmag.\nThough it is not possible to calculate a reliable number for the fraction of SPB stars in NGC 371 the absolute\nnumber of pulsating stars seems to be high compared to\nthe fraction obtained for the Galaxy by Stankov & Handler\n(2005).\nWe see evidence that multimode pulsation is more common in upper part of the main sequence than in the lower.\nWe have also identified periodic pulsation in 3 stars that\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the referee Luis Balona for suggesting that we examined the fundamental radial periods of the stars, which\nhelped to improve the paper significantly.
