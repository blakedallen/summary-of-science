So far, red giant oscillations have been studied from radial velocity and/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of the\noscillation modes. To characterise radial and non-radial oscillations, line profile variations are a valuable diagnostic. Here we present for the\nfirst time a line profile analysis of pulsating red giants, taking into account the small line profile variations and the predicted short damping and\nre-excitation times. We do so by modelling the time variations in the cross correlation profiles in terms of oscillation theory.\nAims. The performance of existing diagnostics for mode identification is investigated for known oscillating giants which have very small line\nprofile variations. We modify these diagnostics, perform simulations, and characterise the radial and non-radial modes detected in the cross\ncorrelation profiles.\nMethods. Moments and line bisectors are computed and analysed for four giants. The robustness of the discriminant of the moments against\nsmall oscillations with finite lifetimes is investigated. In addition, line profiles are simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and\ntheir line shapes are compared with the observations.\nResults. For three stars, we find evidence for the presence of non-radial pulsation modes, while for \u03be Hydrae perhaps only radial modes are\npresent. Furthermore the line bisectors are not able to distinguish between different pulsation modes and are an insufficient diagnostic to\ndiscriminate small line profile variations due to oscillations from exoplanet motion.\n\nKey words. stars: oscillations \u2013 stars: individual: \u01eb Ophiuchi, \u03b7 Serpentis, \u03be Hydrae, \u03b4 Eridani \u2013 Techniques: spectroscopic \u2013 Line: profiles\n\n1. Introduction\nTechniques to perform very accurate radial velocity observations are refined during the last decade. Observations with\nan accuracy of a few m s\u22121 are obtained regularly (see e.g.\nMarcy & Butler (2000), Queloz et al. (2001b)) and detections\nof amplitudes of 1 m s\u22121 are nowadays possible with e.g.\nHARPS (Pepe et al. 2003). This refinement not only forced a\nbreakthrough in the detection of extra solar planets but also in\nthe observation of solar like oscillations in distant stars. Solar\nlike oscillations are excited by turbulent convection near the\nsurface of cool stars of spectral type F, G, K or M and show\nradial velocity variations with amplitudes of typically a few\ncm s\u22121 to a few m s\u22121 , and with periods ranging from a few\nminutes for main sequence stars to about half an hour for subgiants and a couple of hours for giants.\nSend offprint requests to: S. Hekker,\nemail: saskia@strw.leidenuniv.nl\n\nFor several stars on or close to the main sequence, solar like\noscillations were detected for a decade (see e.g. Kjeldsen et al.\n(1995), Bouchy & Carrier (2001), Bouchy & Carrier (2003),\nBedding & Kjeldsen (2003)). More recently, such type of\noscillations has also been firmly established in several\nred (sub)giant stars. Frandsen et al. (2002), De Ridder et al.\n(2006b), Carrier et al. (2006), (see also Barban et al. (2004))\nand Carrier et al. (2003) used the CORALIE and ELODIE\nspectrographs to obtain long term high resolution time series\nof the three red giants \u03be Hydrae, \u01eb Ophiuchi and \u03b7 Serpentis\nand of the subgiant \u03b4 Eridani, respectively. They unravelled a\nlarge frequency separation in the radial velocity Fourier transform, with a typical value expected for solar like oscillations\nin the respective type of star (a few \u03bcHz for giants and a\nfew tens \u03bcHz for subgiants), according to theoretical predictions (e.g. Dziembowski et al. (2001)). It was already predicted\nby Dziembowski (1971) that non-radial oscillations are highly\ndamped in evolved stars, and that, most likely, any detectable\noscillations will be radial modes.\n\n\f2\n\nS. Hekker et al.: Pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants\n\nSo far, red (sub)giant oscillations have only been studied from radial velocity or light variations. Line profile variations are a very valuable diagnostic to detect both radial and non-radial heat driven coherent oscillations (e.g.\nAerts & De Cat (2003) and references therein), and to characterise the wavenumbers (l, m) of such self-excited oscillations. It is therefore worthwhile to try and detect them for red\n(sub)giants with confirmed oscillations and, if successful, to\nuse them for empirical mode identification. This would provide an independent test for the theoretical modelling of the\nfrequency spectrum.\nIt is also interesting to compare the line profile diagnostics\nused for stellar oscillation analysis with those usually adopted\nto discriminate oscillations from exoplanet signatures, such\nas the line bisector and its derived quantities. Recently, Gray\n(2005) pointed out that the wide range of bisector shapes he\nfound must contain information about the velocity fields in the\natmospheres of cool stars, but that the extraction of information\nabout the velocity variations requires detailed modelling. Here\nwe perform such modelling in terms of non-radial oscillation\ntheory. We do so by considering different types of line characteristics derived from cross correlation profiles. Dall et al.\n(2006) already concluded that bisectors are not suitable to analyse solar like oscillations. We confirm this finding and propose\nmuch more suitable diagnostics. We nevertheless investigate\nhow line bisector quantities behave for confirmed oscillators, in\norder to help future planet hunters in discriminating the cause\nof small line profile variations in their data.\nThe main problems in characterising the oscillation modes\nof red (sub)giants are, first, the low amplitudes of the velocity variations, which results in very small changes in the\nline profile. Secondly, the damping and re-excitation times\nare predicted to be very short. Indeed, Stello et al. (2004) derived an oscillation mode lifetime in \u03be Hydrae of only approximately two days. In general, mode lifetimes are difficult to compute for different stellar parameters from current\navailable theory, cf. Houdek et al. (1999) versus Stello et al.\n(2004). Stello et al. (2006) derived the observed mode lifetime\nof \u03be Hydrae from extensive simulations and find a large difference with theoretical predictions. The known mode identification methods from line profile variations all use an infinite mode lifetime so far. Here, we provide line profile variations simulated for stochastically excited modes, and investigate how the damping affects the behaviour of the diagnostics in this case. We apply our methodology to the four\ncase studies of \u03be Hydrae (HD100407, G7III), \u01eb Ophiuchi\n(HD146791, G9.5III), \u03b7 Serpentis (HD168723, K0III) and \u03b4\nEridani (HD23249, K0IV). Some basic properties of these stars\nare listed in Table 1.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 the data set\nat our disposal and different observational diagnostics are described. In Sect. 3 the diagnostics for mode identification are\ndescribed, while in Sect. 4 the damping and re-excitation effects in theoretically generated spectral lines are investigated.\nIn Sect. 5 the results obtained from the simulations and observations are compared and in Sect. 6 some conclusions are\ndrawn.\n\nFig. 1. Power spectrum of \u01eb Ophiuchi. The lower black one is\nobtained by De Ridder et al. (2006b), the grey one in the middle is obtained from hvi and the top one is obtained from the\nbisector velocity span. For clarity the latter two are shifted.\n\n2. Observational diagnostics\n\n2.1. Spectra\nFor all four stars we have spectra at our disposal obtained with\nthe fibre fed \u00e9chelle spectrograph CORALIE mounted on the\nSwiss 1.2 m Euler telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). The observations for \u03be Hydrae were made during one full month (2002\nFebruary 18 - March 18). This is the same dataset as used by\nFrandsen et al. (2002) for the detection of the solar like oscillations. For \u01eb Ophiuchi and \u03b7 Serpentis the solar like observations described by De Ridder et al. (2006b) and Carrier et al.\n(2006) are obtained from a bi-site campaign, using CORALIE\nand ELODIE (the fibre fed \u00e9chelle spectrograph mounted on\nthe French 1.93 m telescope at the Observatoire the HauteProvence) during the summer of 2003. The observations of\n\u03b4 Eridani are obtained with CORALIE during a twelve day\ncampaign in November 2001. For the line profile analysis, described in this paper, only the data obtained with CORALIE are\nused. These spectra range in wavelength from 387.5 nm to 682\nnm and the observation times were adjusted to reach a signal to\nnoise ratio of at least 100 at 550 nm (60-120 for \u03b4 Eridani) without averaging out a too large fraction of the pulsation phase.\nMore details about the observation strategy is available in the\npublications describing the first detections of the solar like oscillations of the respective stars.\n\n2.2. Cross correlation profiles\nThe line profile variations of the four pulsating red (sub)giants\nare analysed with moments (Aerts et al. 1992) and with the line\nbisector (Gray 2005). The moments are often used to analyse\nstellar oscillations excited by a heat mechanism, while the line\nbisector is usually adopted to discover planet signatures. Both\nmethods can be applied to one single spectral line, but also to a\n\n\fS. Hekker et al.: Pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

(2001) already\nperformed a line profile analysis on cross correlation profiles for a \u03b4 Scuti star using moments (Aerts et al. 1992).\nCompared to the analysis of a single spectral line this only\nintroduces some additional terms in the moments for which\ncan be corrected. Furthermore, the line bisector analysis is\nwidely used on cross correlation profiles (see e.g. Queloz et al.\n(2001a), Setiawan et al. (2003), Mart\u0131\u0301nez Fiorenzano et al.\n(2005), Dall et al. (2006)). Dall et al. (2006) showed that the\ncross correlation bisector contains the same information as single line bisectors.\n\nFig. 3. Power spectrum of \u03be Hydrae. The lower black one is obtained by Frandsen et al. (2002), the grey one is obtained from\nhvi. The two top power spectra are obtained from the bisector velocity span. The top one is the original, while the lower\none is corrected for the 1 c d\u22121 (11.57\u03bcHz) frequency due to\nthe diurnal cycle. For clarity the latter three power spectra are\nshifted.\n\nFig. 4. Power spectrum of \u03b4 Eridani. The lower black one is\nobtained by Carrier et al.

Hekker et al.: Pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants\n\nThe red (sub)giants analysed in the present work show low\namplitude radial velocity variations, which result in very small\nline profile variations. The INTER-TACOS (INTERpreter\nfor the Treatment, the Analysis and the COrrelation of\nSpectra) software package developed at Geneva Observatory\n(Baranne et al. 1996), was used to cross correlate the observed\nspectrum with a mask containing atmospheric lines of red\n(sub)giants with a resolution of 100 m s\u22121 . On top of that we\ninterpolated to a resolution of 10 m s\u22121 to reach the highest\npossible precision in the computation of the moments.\n\n2.3. Frequency analysis\nIn order to see whether the line moments and line bisector are\nsensitive enough to determine the very small line profile variations present in pulsating red (sub)giants, a frequency analysis is performed and compared with the frequencies obtained\npreviously. Frandsen et al. (2002), De Ridder et al. (2006b),\nCarrier et al. (2006) and Carrier et al. (2003) used radial velocity variations, obtained with the optimum weight method described by Bouchy et al. (2001), for their frequency analysis.\n\n2.3.1. Moments\nA line profile can be described by its moments (Aerts et al.\n1992). The first moment hvi represents the centroid velocity\nof the line profile, the second moment hv2 i the width of the\nline profile and the third moment hv3 i the skewness of the line\nprofile. The quantity hvi is thus a particular measure of the\nradial velocity and should therefore show similar frequency\nbehaviour. We expect it to perform less well than the radial\nvelocity measure derived from the optimum weight method\n(Bouchy et al. 2001) (see below), but hvi is a mode identification diagnostic (Aerts et al. 1992), while other radial velocity\nmeasures are not. This is why we re-compute and re-analyse\nthe radial velocity from hvi here.\nFrequencies are determined with the conventional method\nof iterative sinewave fitting ('prewhitening'). A Scargle periodogram (Scargle 1982) is used with frequencies between 0\nand 15 cycles per day (c d\u22121 ) (173.6 \u03bcHz) and with a frequency step of 0.0001 c d\u22121 (0.001 \u03bcHz) for the red giants.\nFor the subgiant frequencies between 0 and 150 c d\u22121 and a\nfrequency step of 0.001 c d\u22121 are used. The significance of\nthe frequencies is calculated with respect to the average amplitude of the periodogram after prewhitening as described in\nKuschnig et al. (1997). The errors in the frequency are obtained\nwith the method described by Breger et al. (1999) and have typical values of 10\u22124 c d\u22121 (10\u22129 \u03bcHz) for the giants and 10\u22123 c d\u22121\n(10\u22128 \u03bcHz) for the subgiant.\nThe frequencies of hvi are compared to the frequencies obtained from radial velocities derived from the optimum weight\nmethod, mentioned in earlier publications. In Figs 1, 2, 3 and\n4 the power spectra of \u01eb Ophiuchi, \u03b7 Serpentis, \u03be Hydrae and \u03b4\nEridani are shown, respectively. The lower black power spectra\nare the ones obtained by De Ridder et al. (2006b), Carrier et al.\n(2006), Frandsen et al. (2002) and Carrier et al. (2003), while\n\nthe grey ones in the middle are obtained from hvi in the present\nwork.\nAlthough the same data is used, a comparison is made between power spectra of two different representations of the radial velocity variations, computed with different methods. The\nradial velocity derived from the optimum weight method is intrinsically more precise than the one from hvi of the cross correlation. It not only uses the full spectrum instead of a box shaped\nmask, but also relies on weights of the individual spectra. These\ndifferences influence the noise and the amplitudes in the power\nspectra. On top of that the reference point of each night is determined by the observation with the highest signal to noise ratio\nin case of the optimum weight method and by the average of\nthe night in case hvi is used. As nightly reference points are\neffectively a high pass filter, different filters induce differences\nat low frequencies in the power spectra.\nDespite these differences the comparison between the\npower spectra in the literature and obtained from hvi is very\ngood, especially for \u01eb Ophiuchi and \u03b4 Eridani. For \u03b7 Serpentis,\nthe dominant frequencies obtained by Carrier et al. (2006) are\nslightly different. This is mainly due to the additional ELODIE\ndata, which contains a substantial number of observations and\ntherefore alters the time sampling of the data. In case only the\nCORALIE data are taken into account, the dominant frequencies match very well. For \u03be Hydrae the dominant frequencies\nobtained by Frandsen et al. (2002) are more distinct than those\nobtained from hvi. This is due to the low amplitude of this star,\nwhich implies a larger relative difference between the different computations of the radial velocity than for the other two\ngiants. Nevertheless, the overall shape of the power spectra obtained from the radial velocity and from hvi is comparable. The\nfact that hvi shows the same behaviour as the radial velocity\nobtained with the method described by Bouchy et al. (2001),\nindicates that this moment diagnostic is able to detect low amplitude oscillations of red (sub)giants.\nThe behaviour of hv2 i obtained from a cross correlation is\nnot exactly the same as for a single spectral line. Chadid et al.\n(2001) show that the constant of a sinusoidal fit through hv2 i\nis different in case of a cross correlation compared to a single\nspectral line. Furthermore, a fit through hv3 i obtained from a\ncross correlation contains a non zero constant, which is not the\ncase for a single spectral line. This indicates that we should\nbe very cautious in interpreting the constants of the moments.\nChadid et al. (2001) attribute the different behaviour of hv2 i\nand hv3 i obtained from cross correlation to the influence of\npossible blending with very faint lines which alters the absolute values of hv2 i and hv3 i, but not their variation.\nFor the observed red giants, hv2 i shows variations in the\naverage value per night, which is probably caused by changing instrumental conditions. Although a correction for this behaviour is applied by shifting the values of each night to the\naverage value of all observations, hv2 i does not behave as predicted from theory. Frequencies for hv2 i are expected to be:\n\u03bdi , \u03bdi + \u03bd j or \u03bdi \u2212 \u03bd j , with \u03bdi, j the frequencies obtained in hvi\n(Mathias et al. 1994), but are not found in the observations. For\nall four stars, the frequencies obtained for hv3 i are the same as\nfor hvi, which is as expected.\n\n\fS. Hekker et al.: Pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants\n\n2.3.2. Line Bisector\nThe line bisector is a measure of the displacement of the centre\nof the red and blue wing from the core of the spectral line at\neach residual flux. The line bisector is often characterised by\nthe bisector velocity span, which is defined as the horizontal\ndistance between the bisector positions at fractional flux levels\nin the top and bottom part of the spectral line, see for instance\nBrown et al. (1998). The bisector velocity span is supposed to\nremain constant over time in case of substellar companions.\nThe bisector velocity span is calculated in this work as the\ndifference between the bisector at a fractional flux level of 0.80\nand 0.20. The frequencies of the bisector velocity span are determined in the same way as the frequencies of the moments.\nBisector velocity spans are calculated for simulated spectral\nlines of stars pulsating with different modes, using \u01eb Ophiuchi's\namplitude. In case of noiseless line profiles and infinite mode\nlifetimes, the dominant frequency of modes with m = 0 is 2\u03bd,\nwith \u03bd the dominant frequency obtained for hvi. In case m , 0,\n\u03bd is obtained as the dominant frequency. For infinite mode lifetimes the dominant frequency obtained for modes with m = 0 is\nlow, but at 2\u03bd the power spectrum also shows a clear excess. For\nmodes with m , 0 we obtained \u03bd as the dominant frequency.\nThis is completely in line with the behaviour expected for hv2 i\n(Aerts et al. 1992).\nTo give an estimate of the minimum signal to noise ratio\nneeded to detect a dominant frequency, with the amplitude detected for \u01eb Ophiuchi in the bisector velocity span, we added\nwhite noise to the simulated spectral lines. These simulations\nreveal that for pulsations with infinite as well as finite mode\nlifetimes with m = 0, a signal to noise ratio of 100 000 is\nnot enough to reveal a frequency in the bisector velocity span,\nwhile a signal to noise ratio of order a few 10 000 would suffice\nfor modes with m , 0. The signal to noise ratio of the cross\ncorrelation profiles of our targets does not exceed a few 1 000\n(see Equation 1). This signal to noise level is much less than\nthe minimum value needed to detect the oscillations.\nThe top graphs in Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the power spectra of the bisector velocity span for \u01eb Ophiuchi, \u03b7 Serpentis, \u03be\nHydrae and \u03b4 Eridani, respectively. The bisector velocity spans\nfor \u01eb Ophiuchi and \u03b7 Serpentis do not show any dominant frequency. The power spectrum of the bisector velocity span of\n\u03be Hydrae shows peaks at 1 c d\u22121 (11.57\u03bcHz) and at its 1 day\naliases (Fig. 3 top). The aliases are due to the diurnal cycle and\nin case these are removed no dominant frequencies in the bisector velocity span can be seen (Fig. 3 second power spectrum\nfrom the top). For \u03b4 Eridani the bisector velocity span shows\nsome peaks at low frequencies, but from asteroseismological\nconsiderations solar like pulsations can not occur at these low\nfrequencies in subgiants. These peaks are probably caused by\ninstrumental effects. From the present test case, one can thus\nconclude that, at least for low amplitude oscillations, discrimination between exoplanet companions and pulsations is not\npossible with the bisector velocity span on data with realistic\nsignal to noise ratio. This result is consistent with Dall et al.\n(2006).\n\n5\n\n3. Theoretical mode diagnostics\nIn order to characterise wavenumbers (l, m) for the modes\npresent in the red (sub)giants, the mathematical description\nof the line bisector (Brown et al. 1998) and of the moments\n(Aerts et al. 1992) are investigated.\nBrown et al. (1998) introduced a mathematical description\nfor the line bisector in terms of orthogonal Hermite functions. The Hermite coefficients hi describe the line shapes.\nInformation on the oscillation mode, inclination and velocity\nparameters of the star was obtained by Brown et al. (1998)\nfrom a comparison with theoretically generated line profile\nvariations during a pulsation cycle, assuming infinite mode\nlifetimes. To obtain the wavenumbers of the oscillations, the\nHermite coefficients or bisector velocity span obtained from\nobservations are compared with the ones calculated for the simulated line profiles. The main drawback of this description in\nHermite functions is the lack of a pulsation theory directly coupled to the Hermite coefficients or bisector velocity span. For\nthis reason we do not use it here.\nThe variations in the observed moments of the line profiles are compared with their theoretical expectations derived\nfrom oscillation theory (Aerts et al. 1992). The moments are a\nfunction of wavenumbers l, m, inclination i, pulsation velocity\namplitude \u03c5 p , projected rotational velocity \u03c5 sin i and intrinsic\nwidth of the line profile \u03c3. The comparison is performed objectively with a discriminant (Aerts et al. (1992), Aerts (1996),\nBriquet & Aerts (2003)) which selects the most likely set of parameters (l, m, i, \u03c5 p, \u03c5 sin i, \u03c3). Due to the fact that several combinations of the wavenumbers and velocity parameters result in\nalmost the same line profile variation, the \"few\" best solutions\nresulting from the discriminant should be investigated carefully\nbefore drawing conclusions about the mode identity.\nThe fact that hvi and hv3 i are sensitive to the very small\nline profile variations and the direct connection between the\nmoments and pulsation theory makes moments, in principle,\nsuitable for the analysis of pulsating red (sub)giants, provided\nthat we test its robustness against small amplitudes and the finite lifetimes of the modes. This is what we have done in the\npresent work.\n\n3.1. Discriminant\nIn the present analysis the discriminant is determined for l =\n0, 1, 2, inclination angles ranging from 5\u25e6 until 85\u25e6 with steps\nof 1\u25e6 , projected rotational velocity \u03c5 sin i and intrinsic width\nof the line profile \u03c3 between 0 and 5 km s\u22121 with steps of 0.5\nkm s\u22121 . Furthermore a limbdarkening coefficient u(\u03bb) of 0.5 is\nused (van Hamme 1993).\nDue to the fact that the red (sub)giants show low amplitude variations, the discriminant might give inclination angles\nclose to an inclination angle of complete cancellation (IACC)\n(Chadid et al. 2001). Complete cancellation occurs when the\nstar is looked upon in such way that the contribution to hvi of\neach point on the stellar disk exactly cancels out the contribution of another point on the stellar disk. Therefore the angles\nclose to 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 are not taken into account, as well as solutions close to the IACC at i = 54.7\u25e6 for l = 2, m = 0.\n\n\f6\n\nS. Hekker et al.: Pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants\n\nAs the discriminant is designed for oscillations inducing\nmoment variations larger than the equivalent width of the line\n(moment of order zero), a check needs to be performed whether\nthis technique is applicable in the present work. Therefore three\nseries of spectral line profiles with infinite lifetimes and different pulsation velocity amplitudes are generated using the 628\nobservation times of \u01eb Ophiuchi. The dominant frequency of \u01eb\nOphiuchi, 5.03 c d\u22121 (58.2 \u03bcHz), is used as an input parameter\nat an inclination of i = 35\u25e6 for wavenumbers l = 0, 1, 2 with\npositive m values, a projected rotational velocity \u03c5 sin i = 3.5\nkm s\u22121 and an intrinsic width \u03c3 = 4 km s\u22121 . Furthermore, the\nequivalent width of the spectral lines is taken to be 10 km s\u22121 ,\nwhile the minimum amplitude of the pulsation velocity (\u03c5 p )\nis 0.04 km s\u22121 and increases with a factor of 10 for the different series. For these series the moments are calculated as\nwell as the discriminant. For a pulsation velocity amplitude\nof 0.04 km s\u22121 , which resembles the data best, hv2 i of modes\nwith m = 0 all show the expected harmonic of the frequency\n(Mathias et al. 1994), but with a different constant. The discriminant values only differ by an order of 0.01 km s\u22121 . This is\nalso the case for a pulsation velocity amplitude of 0.4 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich indicates that the discriminant is not suitable for the\nanalysis of small line profile variations with an amplitude below 1 km s\u22121 . For a pulsation velocity amplitude of 4.0 km s\u22121\nthe difference between the discriminant values increases and\nthe correct mode is present among the best options. This indicates that the discriminant is a useful analysis tool for spectral\nline variations with amplitude larger than about half the equivalent width of the spectral line, but not for red (sub)giants.\n\nTable 2.

Amplitude and phase distribution\nAs the discriminant is not useful in the present analysis, the\nspectral lines are investigated by comparing the amplitude and\nphase across the line profile with the ones obtained from simulations. This is the same procedure as used by Telting et al.\n(1997) for \u03b2 Cephei and by De Cat et al. (2005) for the complex line profile behaviour due to the multi periodic gravity\nmode oscillations in slowly pulsating B stars. The amplitude\nand phase for each velocity in the cross correlation profile are\ndetermined by fitting a harmonic function, with the dominant\nfrequencies of hvi, to the flux values at each velocity pixel of\nthe time series of spectra (Schrijvers et al. 1997). The amplitudes and phases as function of velocity determined from simulated line profiles with l = 0, 1, 2, and positive m values are\nshown in Fig. 5, assuming infinite lifetimes.

Our interpretation will therefore mainly be based on the amplitude\ndistribution which represents an average amplitude across the\nwhole lineforming region considered in the cross correlation\nfunction.\n\n\f8\n\nS.

Damping and re-excitation equations\nA damped and re-excited oscillation mode is damped by a factor e\u2212\u03b7t , with \u03b7 the damping rate, and re-excited before it is\nable to damp out. As a consequence both the amplitude and the\nphase of the oscillation are time dependent:\nf (t) = A(t) sin(2\u03c0\u03bdt + \u03c8(t)).\n\n(2)\n\nTo simulate such an oscillator we follow the description of\nDe Ridder et al. (2006a), and we compute\nf (t) = B(t) sin(2\u03c0\u03bdt) + C(t) cos(2\u03c0\u03bdt),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we let the amplitudes B and C vary with a first order\nautoregressive process in a discrete time domain with time step\n\u2206t:\nBn = e\u2212\u03b7\u2206t Bn\u22121 + \u03b5n+1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5n+1 is a Gaussian distributed excitation kick. For more\ndetails we refer to De Ridder et al. (2006a). The above is applied to the equations for the pulsation velocity which are obtained by taking the time derivative of the displacement components mentioned in Section 3.2, Eq.(2) of De Ridder et al.\n(2002).

Rather than fitting a Lorenz profile to the power spectrum, we simply used the highest peak\nto obtain the oscillation frequency. This implies that the obtained frequencies differ slightly from the input frequency as\npredicted by the Lorenzian probability distribution. The frequencies obtained from hv3 i are the same as the ones obtained\nfor hvi, which is as expected from theory and also seen in the\nobservations of the four red (sub)giants. None of the modes reveal a relation between the frequencies obtained from hvi and\nhv2 i, which is due to the small amplitudes as described in section 2.3.1.\n\n\f10\n\nS.

Amplitude and phase distribution\nThe amplitude and phase distribution as a function of the velocity across the line profiles are investigated for the simulated\nspectral lines. The profiles for the cases with l = 0, 1, 2 and\npositive m values, with a damping time of \u03b7 = 2 days, are\nshown in Fig. 10. The dominant frequency obtained from hvi\nis used for the harmonic fits. This frequency is different for\neach realisation due to the stochastic nature of the forcing. For\neach mode ten realisations are shown in grey, with the average shown in black. The shape of the amplitude of axisymmetric and tesseral modes do not change, although the amplitudes\nper velocity pixel can have different values for different realisations. The drop to zero amplitude in the centre of the line is\nvery characteristic for all the amplitude distributions. However,\nfor the sectoral modes, the shape and value of the amplitudes\nmay be different for different realisations and the amplitude distribution does not necessarily drop in the centre of the line for\nsuch modes. The behaviour does not change significantly with\ninclination.\n\n5. Interpretation\nThe amplitude distribution across the line profile is used for\nmode identification, as in Telting et al. (1997) and De Cat et al.\n(2005). For each star we find different distributions for different\ndominant mode frequencies. This clearly indicates that modes\nwith different wavenumbers (l, m) must be present in the data.\nThus, we detect non-radial modes in the observed cross correlation profiles. In order to identify the wavenumbers of the individual modes, observed amplitude distributions are compared\nwith simulated ones, as is commonly done for mode identifica-\n\ntion. Only very recently, Zima (2006) implemented a statistical\nmeasure to quantify the identification of (l, m) as a function of\namplitude across the profile for modes with infinite lifetime.\nA similar quantitative measure in the case of damped oscillations is not yet available, but visual inspection of amplitude\ndiagrams allows a clear discrimination between axisymmetric\nand non-axisymmetric modes which is what we do here, based\non simulations. The averaged amplitudes over different realisations (indicated in black in Fig. 10) are used for this comparison, keeping in mind that the observations are single realisations. Due to the fact that single realisations of different modes\nare in some cases comparable, different sets of wavenumbers\nare occasionally likely for observed modes.\nFor \u01eb Ophiuchi the amplitude of the first frequency \u03bd = 5.03\nc d\u22121 (58.2\u03bcHz) resembles the one of modes with l = 2, m =\n2 mode. The mode with frequency \u03bd = 5.46 c d\u22121 (63.2\u03bcHz)\nresembles an m = 1 mode, although it does not exclude an m =\n0 mode. The mode with \u03bd = 5.83 c d\u22121 (67.5\u03bcHz) resembles an\nl = 2, m = 2 mode.\nThe modes with frequency \u03bd = 11.17 c d\u22121 (129.3\u03bcHz) and\n\u03bd = 11.71 c d\u22121 (135.5\u03bcHz) obtained for \u03b7 Serpentis resembles\na realisation of the l = 2, m = 2 mode, while the mode with the\nthird frequency (\u03bd = 10.38 c d\u22121 (102.2\u03bcHz)) is likely to have\nm = 0.\nFor \u03be Hydrae the most dominant frequency \u03bd = 8.42 c d\u22121\n(97.5\u03bcHz) reveals a mode with either m = 0 or m = 1.\nFor \u03b4 Eridani the dominant mode (\u03bd = 59.40 c d\u22121\n(687.5\u03bcHz)) resembles an m = 1, while the second one (\u03bd =\n61.08 c d\u22121 (706.9\u03bcHz)) is characteristic for an m = 0 mode.\nThe third mode (\u03bd = 52.68 c d\u22121 (609.7\u03bcHz)) shows an addi-\n\n\fS.

This result is robust against a change in the value of the\ninclination angle for the simulations.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Discussion and conclusions\n\nReferences\n\nWe have implemented a line profile generation code for\ndamped and re-excited solar like oscillations. We found that the\nquantities hvi, hv3 i and amplitude across the profile are good\nline diagnostics to characterise these oscillations. Our simulations were made for a single lineforming region while we compared them with cross correlation profiles based on a mask. For\nthis reason, the phase variations across the profile are difficult\nto interpret, since they are an average over the depth in the atmosphere, and this average depends on the shape of the eigenfunctions. Moreover, we learned from our simulations that the\nphase behaviour can be quite different for realisations, as illustrated in Fig. 10. More extensive simulations across the depth\nwould be needed to interpret the observed phase behaviour in\ndetail. In order to do so, we would need to know the shape of\nthe excited eigenmodes as a function of depth in the outer regions of the star.\nFrom the frequency analysis performed on the bisector velocity span, it becomes clear that it is not a good diagnostic to\nunravel solar like oscillations.\nIndividual mode identification is not yet possible with the\nmethod used in the present work. This is not surprising because we did a first exploration of how well-working methods\nfor modes with infinite lifetimes could be adapted for damped\noscillations. The discriminant of the moments is not useful at\nthe low amplitudes present in the sub(giants) investigated in\nthe present work. Nevertheless, from the resemblance between\nthe observed amplitude distribution with the simulated ones,\nand comparison between different modes of the same star, we\npresented clear observational evidence for modes with different m-values in the same star for three of our four examples,\ni.e. non-radial modes are present in red (sub)giants. The amplitudes for \u03be Hydrae are too low to make firm conclusions, and\nsince we see only one frequency in the line profile variations, a\ncomparison of the amplitude shapes for different modes is not\npossible. Therefore we can not exclude that this star has only\nradial modes as proposed by Frandsen et al. (2002).\nDziembowski et al. (2001) and Houdek & Gough (2002)\nshow theoretically that stochastically excited radial pulsation\nmodes are most likely to be observed in red giants. They predict that, for non-radial modes, damping effects will have influence in the p-mode cavity as well as in the g-mode cavity,\nwhile for radial modes only damping in the p-mode cavity is\npresent. Therefore, according to this theory, radial modes are\nless severely influenced by damping than non-radial modes.\nOur result pointing towards the presence of non-radial modes,\ncalls for a re-evaluation of the theoretical predictions.\n\nAerts, C. 1996, A&A, 314, 115\nAerts, C. & De Cat, P. 2003, Space Science Reviews, 105, 453\nAerts, C., De Pauw, M., & Waelkens, C. 1992, A&A, 266, 294\nBaranne, A., Queloz, D., Mayor, M., et al. 1996, A&AS, 119,\n373\nBarban, C., De Ridder, J., Mazumdar, A., et al. 2004, in ESA\nSP-559: SOHO 14 Helio- and Asteroseismology: Towards a\nGolden Future, 113\nBedding, T.
