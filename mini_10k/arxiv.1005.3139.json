This occurred\nas a local manifestation of a global transition of the intergalactic\nmedium in the whole universe referred to as Cosmic Reionization,\ncaused by the radiation from the first galaxies. This process converted the intergalactic medium from neutral and cold gas during\nthe Cosmic Dark Ages before any galaxies existed, into a hot, ionized plasma.\nThe absorption spectra of QSOs from redshift 0 to about 6\nshow that the intergalactic medium has been almost fully ionized for most of the lifetime of the Universe. On the other hand,\nthe recent data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP) satellite yielded a rather large optical depth for scattering the Cosmic Microwave Background photons on free electrons.\nThis strongly suggests that the reionization epoch started well be\u22c6\n\ne-mail: I.T.Iliev@sussex.ac.uk\n\nfore redshift 10 and therefore was fairly extended in time. It also\nconfirmed independently the existence of a reionization epoch, required by this additional optical depth. The process of reionization\nhad far-reaching consequences for subsequent galaxy formation.\nThe photoionization heating which accompanies reionization increased the gas temperature from the very low one, of order a few K\nor less, during the Cosmic Dark Ages before the first stars formed,\nto \u223c 104 K or more. This in turn increased the corresponding Jeans\nmass, the mass above which gas pressure cannot sucessfully counteract gravity, by about 5 orders of magnitude. This strongly suppressed the formation of low-mass galaxies and cut off the star formation in previously-formed ones, and thereby should have significantly influenced the early population of dwarf satellite galaxies.\nFor this reason, reionization is often invoked as a plausible explanation for the observed lack of galaxy satellites compared to the\nnumbers predicted by pure dark matter simulations (Bullock et al.\n2000; Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2009; Macci\u00f2 et al. 2010; Busha et al. 2010).\nThe same ionization and heating process also changed significantly\nthe character of star formation, as stars whose formation starts out\nfrom hot, ionized gas, even those with a primordial element abun-\n\n\f2\n\nI. T. Iliev, et al.\n\ndance, are different from the ones forming out of initially cold gas\n(e.g. Mackey et al. 2003).\nIn recent years a variety of theoretical and numerical modelling work has shown that reionization was highly patchy in nature, with a very large variations in the times at which different\nregions become reionized (e.g. Iliev et al. 2006, 2007; Zahn et al.\n2007). Many of the effects of reionization on the later structure\nformation are highly dependent on the stage at which the forming\nstructures are at the time when they become reionized. Therefore,\nit is important to follow the reionization history of different patches\nin detail and to compare the timing of reionization with the stage\nof formation of the local structures.\nWeinmann et al. (2007) used large-scale reionization simulations to study the reionization history of galaxies of a variety of\npresent-day types: field galaxies, cD central cluster galaxies, L\u2217\ngalaxies and Local Group-like systems. In particular, they focused\non the question which galaxies are reionized internally (i.e. by\ntheir own progenitors) vs. externally (i.e. before sigificant fraction\nof their mass is in collapsed objects). For most galaxy types the\nanswer is statistical, with certain probabilities for each outcome.\nThey found that there is a halo mass scale, of order 1012 M \u2299,\nwhich divides the massive galaxies which are predominantly internally reionized and lower-mass ones for which the opposite is true.\nMore recently, Alvarez et al. (2009) studied the same problem using larger-scale, coarsely-resolved semi-analytical reionization calculations. They achieved better statistics for the larger halos, from\nMilky Way-sized up to galaxy clusters, as a consequence of the\nlarger volume their calculation followed and reached very similar\nconclusions to Weinmann et al. (2007).\nHowever, these previous studies are statistical and therefore\ncan only yield a certain probability for a given type of system to be\nexternally or internally reionized. In contrast, the answer for a specific system, like our own Local Group of galaxies, consisting of\nthe Milky Way, Andromeda, M33 and their satellite galaxies, will\ndepend on the details of its and its neighbouring systems' formation, the timing of that formation, and the relative positions in space\nof their projenitors at the relevant epochs. This kind of detailed information can only be obtained through numerical simulations with\nconstrained initial conditions.\nConstrained simulations aim to reproduce the spatial and velocity structure of our Local Group and its neighbourhood at\npresent (redshift z = 0). In this work we combine the most advanced constrained realizations of the Local Group available at\npresent with an accurate treatment of the radiative transfer during\ncosmic reionization. This allowed us for the first time to calculate\nthe specific reionization history of all Local Group progenitors, as\nwell as those of the nearby structures like the Virgo and Fornax\nclusters of galaxies.\n\n2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Constrained simulations of the local universe\nThe optimal way of constructing a numerical simulation that\nclosely reproduces our local cosmological neighborhood is provided by the Hoffman & Ribak (1991) algorithm for making a constrained realizations of Gaussian random field. Given our ability\nto extract observational data that can be imposed as linear constraints on the primordial perturbation field, this method can be\nused to construct initial conditions that obey these constraints. Here\nwe follow Klypin et al. (2003) and impose two types of data on\n\nFigure 1. Collapsed fraction in high-mass (M > 109 M\u2299 ; red, solid) and\nlow-mass sources (M < 109 M\u2299 ; blue, dashed) (insets show the same in\nlog scale) vs. cosmic redshift for WMAP5 (left) and WMAP3 (right) cases.\n\nthe simulation. The first data set consists of peculiar velocities of\ngalaxies, drawn from the MARK III (Willick et al. 1997), surface\nbrightness fluctuations (Tonry et al. 2001) catalogues and the Catalog of Nearby Galaxies (Karachentsev et al. 2004). The other data\nset is obtained from the catalog of nearby X-ray selected clusters\nof galaxies (Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer 2002). The main obstacle faced\nhere is how to translate the present epoch observables into quantities that are linear in the primordial perturbation fields. Peculiar\nvelocities evolve more slowly than the density field and are assumed here to be linear. The present epoch virial parameters of\nthe clusters are processed by the spherical top-hat model to produce their linear overdensity. The data used here and its associated\nobservational errors effectively constrain the LSS on scales larger\nthan \u2248 5 h\u22121 Mpc (cf. Klypin et al. 2003). The simulation used\nhere is designed to reproduce the Local Supercluster, harbouring\na Virgo-like cluster. Such a configuration is easily reproduced by\nthe constrained simulations. Local Group (LG) like objects, on the\nother hand, are randomly emerging in the simulations. The simulations used here were each selected out of a few to have a LG-like\nobject, similar to the observed one. They are described in more detail in Gottloeber et al. (2010).\nStarting from the above constrained initial conditions, the\nGADGET-2 code (Springel 2005) was used to follow the dark matter in a L = 64 h\u22121 Mpc computational box, spanned by 10243\nparticles, starting at redshift z = 100. The cosmological parameters given by the WMAP 3-year data have been adopted (\u03a9M =\n0.24, \u03a9\u039b = 0.76, h = 0.73, \u03a9b = 0.0418, \u03c38 = 0.75, n = 0.95),\ngiving a particle mass of mDM = 1.63 \u00d7 107 h\u22121 M\u2299 . (A more\ndetailed description is provided in Zavala et al. (2009)).\nIn order to check the robustness of our results with respect to\nthe particular realization of the constrained simulation, we also performed a second simulation with an independent underlying random realization. This second simulation implements the same constraints on the local structures at the present time. The simulation\nvolume and number of particles are the same as above, while the\nbackground cosmology is now based on the WMAP 5-year data,\ncombined with the available constraints from the large-scale structure (BAO) and supernovae (\u03a9M = 0.279, \u03a9\u039b = 0.721, h =\n0.73, \u03a9b = 0.046, \u03c38 = 0.817, n = 0.96). In this case we include in the analysis not just the Local Group and Virgo, but also\nour other nearby galaxy cluster, Fornax. In Figure 2 we show the\nlocal density distribution at redshift z = 9 within a slice of comoving 30h\u22121 Mpc \u00d7 30h\u22121 Mpc and 7h\u22121 Mpc depth which contains the projenitors of the objects of interest, Virgo, Fornax, M31\nand Milky Way. The slice is situated in the supergalactic YZ-plane.\nThe main progenitors of these objects have at redshift z = 9 masses\n\n\fReionization of the Local Group\n\nFigure 2.

The circles with\ndecreasing radius according to the decreasing mass of the objects denote the\nregions where the progenitors of Virgo, Fornax, M31 and MW are situated.\nThe slice is situated in the supergalactic YZ-plane.\n\nof 1.2 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 , 6.6 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 , 3.8 \u00d7 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 ,\nand 3.4 \u00d7 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 , respectively. The marked Virgo (Fornax)\nregions are populated with about 2000 (700) cluster progenitors,\neach with a mass larger than 4 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 . This leads to a total\nprogenitor mass of 2.4 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (0.9 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 ). One\ncan clearly see the low density regions between the progenitors of\nthe clusters and the progenitors of the Local Group. There are a\nfew other objects next to the Local Group but with much smaller\nmasses than that concentrated in the proto-cluster regions.\nAll our simulations were performed within the CLUES (Constrained Local UniversE Simulations) project1 .\n\n2.2 Radiative transfer simulations\nThe radiative transfer simulations were performed using a radiative transfer and non-equilibrium chemistry code called C2 Ray (Mellema et al. 2006a), tested in detail as discussed in\nMellema et al. (2006a), Iliev & et al. (2006) and Iliev et al. (2009).\nOur simulation methodology was presented in Iliev et al. (2006);\nMellema et al. (2006b) and Iliev et al. (2007). The underlying Nbody structure formation simulations discussed in the previous section provide a time sequence of density distributions and catalogues\nof identified halos. Gas is assumed to follow the dark matter distribution, which at these scales (0.25 h\u22121 Mpc\u221264 h\u22121 Mpc) is a very\ngood approximation. We have produced 53 density slices and halo\ncatalogues roughly equally spaced in time between the redshifts 20\nand 6, every \u223c 14.5 Myr. All halos are assumed to host galaxies\nand thus to be potential sources of ionizing radiation. Each is assigned an ionizing luminosity proportional to its mass. Low-mass\nsources, with total mass below 109 M\u2299 , are assumed to be active\nin the neutral regions, but to be suppressed in the ionized regions.\n1\n\nhttp://clues-project.org\n\n3\n\nTherefore, once their cell is ionized their emissivity is set to zero.\nThese assumptions are based on the fact that the Jeans mass rises\nsignificantly when a region is ionized and heated, which thereby\nlimits the fresh gas infall onto halos and supresses the future formation of low-mass galaxies, see Iliev et al. (2007) for a more detailed\ndiscussion.\nBoth the density and halos are binned on a 2563 grid for the\nradiative transfer processing. Halos in the same RT cell are combined and a luminosity is assigned following a simple, physicallymotivated prescription. The emissivity of the ionizing sources how many ionizing photons produced in galaxies over some time\nperiod reach the intergalactic medium - depends on what fraction\nof the galactic gas is converted into stars, how effective are the stars\nat producing ionizing photons and, finally, what fraction of the photons manage to escape the galaxy. We parametrise it with a single\nparameter f\u03b3 , which is equal to the number of ionizing photons\nper atom in galaxies which reach the intergalactic medium in the\ntime between two consecutive time slices2 The main difference between our two adopted background cosmologies is in the density\nfluctuation normalization (\u03c38 ). A higher \u03c38 yields higher halo collapsed fractions at any given epoch and a correspondingly larger\nnumber of collapsed halos, as illustrated in Figure 1. In terms of\nreionization this means that for a fixed ionizing emissivity proportional to the collapsed fraction the evolution is shifted to somewhat\nearlier times, resulting in an earlier overlap epoch (Alvarez et al.\n2006). This effect was much larger for WMAP 1-year (\u03c38 = 0.9)\nvs. WMAP 3-year data (\u03c38 = 0.74) than it is for WMAP 5-year\ndata (\u03c38 = 0.8) vs. the WMAP 3-year data.\nMuch larger uncertainty concerns the properties of high redshift sources. Because of the still scarse observational data those\nare not at well constrained at present and hence f\u03b3 is largely a\nfree parameter within certain, fairly wide, bounds. Furthermore, the\nradiative transfer simulations are quite computationally expensive,\nand therefore it is not practical to investigate the full available parameter space. We address this problem by considering two representative cases which are roughly bracketing the range of expected\nbehaviour, while at the same time satisfying the available global\nobservational constraints, as follows. For our Model 1 simulation\nwe use the first N-body realization, with WMAP3 cosmology and\nwe adopt f\u03b3 = 100 for the massive sources (M > 109 M\u2299 ) and\nf\u03b3 = 250 for the low-mass, suppressible ones (M < 109 M\u2299 ).\nThese relatively high efficiencies yield a fairly fast, photon-rich\nreionization process with an early overlap. For our second simulation, on the other hand, we use the second constrained realization,\nwith WMAP5 cosmology, and we adopt a lower source efficiencies of f\u03b3 = 10 for the massive sources and f\u03b3 = 150 for the\nlow-mass ones. This yields a more extended, photon-poor reionization history. For conciseness of notation, we will to refer to the two\ncombinations of N-body realizations and corresponding radiative\ntransfer simulation simply as the Model 1 and Model 2 cases, with\nthe implicit understanding that this implies a different constrained\nrealization and assumed photon emissivities of the sources, as well\nas different background cosmology.\n\n2\n\nOne can also introduce\n\u0001 a slightly different efficiency parameter, g\u03b3 , given\nMyr\nby g\u03b3 = f\u03b3 10\u2206t\nwhere \u2206t is the time between two snapshots from\nthe N-body simulation. This has the advantage that it is a rate per unit time\nand as such it is independent of \u2206t, which makes easier comparisons between simulations with different \u2206t.\n\n\f4\n\nI. T.

(Bottom) Evolution of the mass-weighted ionized fractions, xm\nfor Model 1 (red, dashed) and Model 2 (blue, solid) cases, inset shows the\nsame in linear scale; and (top) the corresponding ratios of mass-weighted\nto volume-weighted ionized fractions, which corresponds to the average\ndensity of the ionized regions in units of the mean, versus redshift z.\n\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Global reionization history\nThe global mass-weighted reionization histories produced by our\ntwo simulations are shown in Figure 3. In either case reionization\nstarts when the first resolved halos (which correspond to the first\nionizing sources) form, around z \u223c 20.\nOur adopted f\u03b3 values yield final overlap of ionized regions\nat zov \u223c 9 (8) for the Model 1 (Model 2) case, in rough agreement with the current observational constraints. The corresponding integrated Thomson scattering optical depth seen by the Cosmic Microwave Background photons is \u03c4es = 0.094(0.069) is\nalso in agreement with the latest constraints from WMAP satellite\ncombined with the other available datasets, \u03c4es = 0.084 \u00b1 0.016\n(Komatsu et al. 2009).\nThe early reionization (z > 14) is driven primarily by the lowmass sources, which have similar efficiencies in the two cases (the\nslightly lower source efficiency in the Model 2 case is compensated\nfor by its higher collapsed fraction at the same redshift) and as a\nconsequence the two reionization histories are initially very similar.\nLater on the larger sources take over, both because of their rapidly\nrising collapsed fraction (cf. Figure 1) and the strong Jeans suppression of the low-mass sources, and thus reionization proceeds more\nslowly in the Model 2 case due to the lower efficiency adopted for\nits high-mass sources. The fact that the mean mass-weighted ionized fraction, xm is always larger than the corresponding volumeweighted one, xv (Figure 3, upper panel) indicates that reionization\nproceeds in an inside-out fashion (i.e. high-density regions are preferentially ionized first) in both cases, in agreement with previous\nsimulation results based on non-constrained realizations (Iliev et al.\n2006). For the Model 2 realization this ratio is noticeably higher, up\nto \u223c 3 at z = 20, due to its more advanced structure formation at\nany given redshift. This also boosts the clumpiness of the gas, and\n\nThe mean reionization history presented above ensures that the\ncurrently available global observational constraints - the electronscattering optical depth and overlap epoch are satisfied. However,\nto achieve our present goals we need to track separately the reionization history of the progenitors of each object of interest, namely\nthe Local Group, as well as the nearby clusters of galaxies. To this\npurpose, we extracted the Lagrangian mass distribution for each\nobject (i.e. the mass which eventually will end up in that object by\nthe present day) and followed the reionization history of all radiative transfer cells containing at least one particle which ends up in\nthat object by z = 0. The resulting local reionization histories are\nshown in Figure 4, along with the global one for direct comparison.\nThe Lagranian regions of both the LG and the nearby clusters are significantly overdense in either constrained realization and\nat all times, reflecting the fact that all of these objects correspond\nto high peaks of the density field. The proto-Local Group region\nstarts only moderately overdense, by \u223c 7% (\u223c 9%) in the Model 1\n(Model 2) case, which rises over time as the corresponding object\ncollapses gravitationally, to reach \u223c 16% (\u223c 25%) by the global\noverlap epoch at z \u223c 9 (8). The proto-clusters correspond to still\nhigher peaks of the density field. Initially the proto-Virgo region is\noverdense by 12% for both simulations, rising over time to 24%\n(30%) for Model 1 (Model 2). The proto-Fornax region (Model\n2) starts 10% overdense, rising to 26% by the global overlap. The\nhigher local density yields an (exponentially) larger halo collapsed\nfraction and thus ionizing photon production. Therefore, for both\nLG and clusters we can expect local reionization to occur earlier\nthan average, which is confirmed by our simulation results (Figure 4).\nIn both simulations the LG reionization starts at about z \u223c\n12.5, at which time its oldest progenitor halos form. Before z \u223c\n12.5 the LG ionized fraction is tiny, below 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 (2 \u00d7 10\u22125 )\nfor Model 1 (Model 2). Thereafter the (proto-)LG reionization accelerates, albeit only gradually. For Model 1 (Figure 4, left) the LG\nionized fraction reaches 17% by z \u223c 12 and 39% by z \u223c 10.5.\nAfter that point the evolution becomes very fast and full ionization\n(xm > 99%) is achieved by z \u223c 10. In contrast, the reionization\nhistory of the (proto-)Virgo cluster in the same Model 1 simulation is quite different. Proto-Virgo is a higher density peak and the\nformation of the local nonlinear structures is therefore accelerated.\nHence the local reionization proceeds faster, as well. The evolution\nremains smooth throughout, with no sudden changes of slope, unlike in the LG case. The mass-weighted ionized fraction reaches\n11% by z = 12.6, 50% by z = 11.3, and 96% by z = 10.5.\nThe reionization histories are similar in the Model 2 case (Figure 4, right). Once again, the proto-cluster regions, both Virgo and\nFornax, reionize earlier than LG and much ealier than an average\nregion - xm = 0.1 is reached by z = 12.3 (12.6), xm = 0.5\nby z = 10.25 (10.5) and xm = 0.9 by z = 9.2 (9.3) for Virgo\n(Fornax). For both proto-clusters overlap (xm = 0.99) is reached\nat z = 8.7 and the evolution remains smooth throughout. Interestingly, most reionization stages (but not the local overlap, which is\nroughly simultaneous) of the Fornax reionization occur earlier than\nthe corresponding ones for Virgo, even though Fornax has lower\nmass at the present epoch. In comparison, the reionization of the\nLG occurs later, reaching xm = 0.1 by z = 11.6, xm = 0.5 by\nz = 9.4, xm = 0.9 by z = 8.6 and local overlap is achieved by\n\n\fReionization of the Local Group\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. Mass-weighted mean ionized fractions, xm , for the Local Group, nearby clusters and global mean (as indicated by color) vs. redshift for Model 1\n(left; left to right: global, LG, Virgo) and Model 2 (right; left to right: global, LG, Virgo, Fornax).\n\nFigure 5. Volume renderig of the total mass, which by the present time (z = 0) will end up as part of the objects of interest here: (left) Virgo cluster (top\nobject) and the Local Group (bottom object) at redshift z = 10; (right) Virgo cluster (top object), the Local Group (middle, smaller object) and Fornax (bottom\nobject) at redshift z = 9. The color scale units are Solar masses per radiative transfer cell.\n\nz = 8.4. It lags the global mean in its earliest stages (z > 12.5), but\nas more progenitor halos form it catches up and then speeds ahead\nafter z = 12. The Local Group reionization history is again much\nless smooth than the proto-cluster ones, with significant changes of\nslope around z \u223c 12, z \u223c 11 and z \u223c 9.6. Evolution becomes\nextremely fast after z \u223c 9.6, whereby the ionized mass fraction\njumps from 0.4 to 1 over redshift interval of just \u2206z \u223c 1. Compared to the Model 1 case the reionization histories for Model 2,\nboth mean and local are ones, are much more extended in time due\nto the lower source emissivities assumed.\nMoving on to a more visual representation of the local reionization history, in Figure 5 we show a 3D volume rendering of the\ndistribution of mass which is destined by the present time (z = 0)\nto become part of the Local Group and nearby clusters for Model 1\nat z = 10 (left) and for Model 2 at z = 9 (right). In the realization\n\ncorresponding to Model 1 the proto-Virgo is a quite large, elongated\nobject, extending for about 10 \u00d7 20 comoving Mpc, which corresponds to about 1 proper Mpc at this early time, while the protoLocal Group is a much smaller object a few Mpc in size, about 7\ncomoving Mpc (less than 1 physical Mpc) away from proto-Virgo.\nIn the alternative, Model 2 realization the size of the proto-Local\nGroup and its distance from Virgo are similar to the Model 1 realization. However, the proto-Virgo is more compact, less extended\nobject and a proto-Fornax is identified, as well, at a similar distance from LG, positioned in almost diametrically opposite direction. Proto-Fornax is a somewhat less extended object than protoVirgo.\nIn Figures 6 and 7 we show the evolution of the neutral mass\nremaining in the objects of interest in a time sequence for simulations Model 1 and Model 2, respectively. In each case the sequence\n\n\f6\n\nI. T. Iliev, et al.\n\nFigure 6. Evolution of the neutral mass at (top to bottom and left to right) redshifts z = 10.75, 10.5, 10.25 and 10 for Model 1. Red is neutral, green is\nionized.\n\ncovers the key time interval during which most of the LG material is ionized. In Model 1 at z = 10.75 the reionization of Virgo\nis already well-advanced, with a local ionized fraction above 83%,\nwhile LG remains largely neutral, at less than 35%. Shortly thereafter, an ionization front arrives at the proto-LG position from the\ndirection of Virgo and quickly sweeps through it as illustrated by\nthe next three images. This corresponds to the dramatic jump of the\nLG local ionized fraction seen in Figure 4 at z = 10.5 \u2212 10.25. By\nz = 10 the Local Group material is almost fully ionized, reaching\n97.5% ionized fraction by mass. In this case, therefore the Local\nGroup is largely ionized from the outside, primarily by the Virgo\nprogenitors.\nThe evolution proceeds quite differently in the photon-poor,\nModel 2, case, as illustrated in Figure 7. While the nearby clusters,\nin this case both Virgo and Fornax, once again reionize themselves\nfrom the inside and relatively earlier than the Local Group, there are\nno clear ionization fronts to arrive from them and sweep over the\nLG material. The Local Group internal sources carve ionized bubbles from the inside and eventually manage to reionize all the LG\nmaterial mostly by themselves. While we cannot exclude modest\ncontributions from Virgo and Fornax, the local LG sources appear\nto dominate the evolution in this case.\nIn order to evaulate the local reionization process for each\nstructure in a more quantitative way, we counted and added up all\nionizing photons emitted by sources within the same Lagrangean\nvolume, normalized by the total number of atoms belonging to that\n\nobject. We also counted and added together the cumulative number\nof ionizing photons used up to ionize each object of interest and\nalso to keep it ionized (i.e. recombinations, since after each recombination back to neutral state that atom would need to be ionized\nagain), again normalized per atom in that object. Comparing the\nvalues of these two numbers over time shows if that particular object by itself produced enough photons up to that point in time to\nfully account for its current ionization state. Results for both Models are shown in Figure 8.\nThe results confirm our conclusions based on the visual examination of the reionization process we discussed above. The galaxy\nclusters initially produce most of the photons needed for their own\nreionization. Until z \u223c 10.5 (z \u223c 9 \u2212 9.5) for Model 1 (Model 2)\nthere is some deficit of photons, i.e. a little more are used up than\nproduced by the progenitors of that cluster. The reason for this is\nthat clusters are located at high peaks of the density field, and it\nis well established that CDM halos, and thus our ionizing sources,\nstrongly cluster around such high peaks. As a consequence of that\nthere are many nearby sources which surround the proto-cluster region and contribute to its reionization. However, we note that the\nfinal overlap in each case is only reached after the cluster itself has\nproduced sufficient number of photons. We also note that recombinations have a very significant effect for proto-clusters, yielding\nusage of 1-1.5 additional ionizing photons per atom in addition to\nthe one photon needed to achieve the initial ionization of that atom.\nOn the other hand, the proto-Local Group results are different\n\n\fReionization of the Local Group\n\n7\n\nFigure 7.

Red is neutral, green/blue is ionized.\n\n\f8\n\nI. T. Iliev, et al.\n\nFigure 8. Cumulative number of ionizing photons for ionizations and recombinations (solid) and photons emitted (dashed), both per atom, for the Local Group\nand nearby clusters (as indicated by color) vs. redshift for Model 1 (left panel) and Model 2 (right panel).\n\nfrom the cluster results in both cases. In the photon-rich Model 1\nup to z \u223c 10.5 there are exactly as many photons produced by\nthe LG progenitors as are used up for its own reionization. After\nthat point however there is a significant change of slope for both\ncurves. Suddenly there are clearly more photons arriving than are\nproduced locally. This change of slope occurs exactly when the ionization front from Virgo was seen above to sweep through the LG\nmaterial. The number of photons used for ionizations and recombinations is above the number of locally-emitted photons and it remains so up to the redshift of full reionization (i.e. local overlap)\nof the Local group, z \u223c 10. This behaviour is more clearly seen\nin the top panel of Figure8 (left), where we show the ratio of photons used over photons emitted locally for LG and Virgo. This ratio\nstarts above one at z \u223c 12.3 \u2212 11.7, indicating that LG the early\nLG reionization is partially helped along by nearby sources that do\nnot belong to it. However, this photon ratio then falls slightly below\none and remains so until z = 10.5. At this point the external ionization front arrives and the ratio jumps to well above one, peaking\nat 1.2 and remaining above 1 until the local overlap. We therefore\nconclude that in this case most of the Local Group gas (up to 70%,\nsee Figure 4) was indeed reionized externally, predominantly by\nthe nearby Virgo cluster.\nIn our Model 2 (photon-poor) case the photon budgets of the\nproto-clusters Virgo and Fornax are very similar to each other as\nwell as to that of proto-Virgo in our Model 1. There is a noticeable\ncontribution of photons from nearby clustered sources, which supply at least 40% more photons than the respective internal sources.\nHowever, after z \u223c 10 (when Virgo is 60% ionized and Fornax is\n70% ionized) the ratio of consumed over produced photons drops\nquickly and by their full ionization (z = 8.7) both clusters have\ninternally produced more photons than are needed for their own\nionization. The local recombinations have a significant effect, resulting in about one additional photon per atom needed to keep\nthem ionized.\nIn contast, the ionizing photons which are produced locally by\nthe Local Group progenitors roughly balance the ones consumed\n\nfor its own reionization all the way up to its neighbourhood overlap\nat z \u223c 8.4. Once again initially (at z > 11) there is some external\ncontribution of ionizing photons from nearby sources, but in this\ncase throughout most of the evolution (8.4 < z < 11.5) the emitted and consumed photons balance within less than 10%. In fact, at\nthe later stages of the evolution the LG progenitor halos produce a\nbit more photons than are actually used to ionize it and keep it ionized. Hence, the Local Group evolves largely isolated in this case.\nAfter the local overlap the LG produces even more photons than are\nactually needed to keep it ionized. The effect of recombinations on\nthe LG reionization history is more modest than in the case of the\nproto-clusters, resulting in only about 0.5-0.8 additional photons\nbeing consumed in either simulation, in agreement with the lower\noverdensity of the LG region. Based on these results we therefore\ncan conclude that in the photon-poor Model 2 the reionization of\nboth the Local Group and of the nearby clusters is mostly a local\nprocess, with no significant external contributions from other structures.\n\n4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have performed the first simulations of the reionization history\nof our local neighbourhood of the universe based on constrained\nN-body simulations of the formation of local structures - our Local\nGroup of galaxies and the nearby galaxy clusters. The reionization\nhistory of the Local Group cannot yet be predicted uniquely, primarily due to the still poor observational constraints on the properties of the reionization sources. Therefore, we studied two models\nconstructed so as to roughly bracket the range of expected outcomes. While both models satisfy the available global observational constraints, they differ significantly in their underlying assumptions. Our first model assumes relatively high ionizing photon\nproduction efficiencies ('photon-rich reionization'), while our second model studies the other extreme, where the sources produce\nbarely enough photons to complete the reionization process in time\n('photon-poor reionization'). The second model therefore results\n\n\fReionization of the Local Group\nin more extended reionization history and delayed final overlap.\nThe two models have the same observational constraints imposed\non their initial matter distribution, which guarantees that the largescale structures closely resemble our local neighbourhood, but they\ndiffer in their random component, yielding different constrained\nrealizations. This allows us to check the robustness of our results\nwith respect to the specific realization. Finally, the two models also\nhave different underlying cosmological models (WMAP 3-year vs.\nWMAP 5-year best fit). However, the effect of the background cosmology is well understood and results in an overall shift of the\nreionization earlier or later, with no significant effects on our results, for which only the relative timing of structure formation vs.\nreionization history is of importance.\nOur results show that the assumed efficiency of the ionizing\nsources has the most important influence on the nature of the reionization history of our Local Group of galaxies. Efficient photon production ensures that the nearby clusters emit more than sufficient\nnumber to ionize both themselves and their surroundings, including the Local Group. The fact that those galaxy clusters (Virgo and\nFornax) coincide with high, rare peaks of the density field means\nthat they form their progenitor halos earlier than the LG, which is\nin a more average region of the universe. As a result, the large-scale\nionization fronts which propagated outward from the proto-clusters\noverrun the Local Group before it managed to form enough sources\nto ionize itself, resulting in its reionization being mostly externallydriven.\nSeveral points are worth noting here. Although generally the\nradiative transfer is a highly non-local phenomenon, which feature\ncomplicates its numerical treatment and the code parallelization,\nduring most of the EoR the situation is somewhat more complicated. The neutral patches have enormous optical depth to soft ionizing radiation (the only type of radiation we consider here). Even\nthe already-ionized patches still have considerable continuum optical depth over cosmological (multiple Mpc) distances due to the\nsmall residual neutral fraction still remaining in such regions3 . This\nresidual neutral fraction diminishes over time, but does so only\ngradually, as more and more sources appear and the mean flux\nthereby increases. As a consequence of all this, reionization starts\nout as a fairly local process where only the relatively nearby, directly visible ionizing sources within the same ionized bubble contribute to the flux at a given point. This property allows us to focus\nour analysis on the important local sources and ignore the far-away\nones for our current purposes (they are of course all included in the\nradiative transfer simulation). In our \u223c 100 Mpc box there are multiple proto-clusters which collapse nonlinearly by the present, but\nof those only Virgo and Fornax are sufficiently close to potentially\ncontribute to the reionization of our Local Group.\nFurthermore, the ionization fronts propagate through underdense regions (voids) much faster than through overdense ones (filaments, knots). Therefore, the relative positioning of the structures\nof interest and the density fluctuations in their immediate neighbourhood are important. Once the available observational constraints are imposed in order to reproduce the local structures, we\nfind that the Local Group is separated from Virgo and Fornax by\nvoids in either realization (see Figure 2). In contrast, the previous\nstudies of this problem which did not use constrained realizations\n(Weinmann et al. 2007; Alvarez et al. 2009) sampled a wide range\n\n3\n\nE.g. At redshift z = 8, mean density and residual neutral fraction of\n10\u22123 the mean free path is \u223c 3 Mpc. Density fluctuations further diminish\nthis value.\n\n9\n\nof environments and relative positions of nearby clusters. Such,\npurely statistical approach yields valuable insights on the range of\nreionization histories that could be expected for a certain type object (e.g. LG-like objects). However, by its nature such approach\nnecessarily includes many objects which, although they share certain basic features, locally do not reproduce the specific large-scale\nstructures around us. Therefore, the constrained realizations are indispensible if we want to make realiable predictions for the effects\nof reionization on our neighbourhood.\nWhy is the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, of our\nLocal Group an important issue? This has a number of important\nimplications for the formation of structures. Reionization dramatically rises the Jeans mass, thus impeding the formation and growth\nof small galaxies. In terms of this effect, the galactic haloes fall into\nthree categories. The gas in the smallest halos (minihalos), whose\nvirial temperatures are below the limit (\u223c 104 K) for efficient radiative cooling through atomic line radiation. The ionization of the\ngas brings its temperature to \u223c 104 K and it boils out, resulting in\ntheir complete evaporation (Shapiro et al. 2004; Iliev et al. 2005),\nwhich leaves behind dark halos. In the other limit, the galaxies\n10\nabove certain mass (M >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 ) have sufficiently deep gravitational potential wells to sucessfully withstand the effects of ionizing radiation and are thus not significantly affected by the reionization process. The effects of radiative feedback on dwarf galaxies of intermediate mass, roughly between 108 M\u2299 and 1010 M\u2299\nis more complex and still very much a subject of active investigation. The gas in such already-formed systems cannot be photoevaporated, as it can cool back down to \u223c 104 K very efficiently.\nHowever, photoionization heating rises the intergalactic gas temperature and pressure, which rises the Jeans mass and thereby suppresses the future formation of very low-mass galaxies, as well as\ncurtails the fresh gas infall onto such halos. Larger galaxies are less\naffected directly, but could do so indirectly, through their smaller\nprogenitors, which could be expected e.g. to result in smoother gas\nsub-structure and modified stellar populations. Where the boundary\nbetween efficient and inefficient feedback from reionization lies is\nstill unclear and very much subject of active research. Full investigation of the effects of reionization on galaxy formation and satellite galaxy populations goes well beyond the scope of the current\nwork. However, our present results indicate that the photon production efficiencies of the first galaxies are the main factor determining\nthe type of reionization history which our Local Group underwent.\nTherefore, this process should have left useful fossil records in the\nproperties of our neighbourhood which will help us use local observations to answer some of the key questions about the young\nuniverse.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis study was supported in part by Swiss National Science\nFoundation grant 200021-116696/1 and Swedish Research Council grant 60336701.
