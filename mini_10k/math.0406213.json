We show that this central extension is nontrivial in the case of a torus of\ndimension \u2265 6 and in the case of a two-dimensional surface of genus \u2265 3.\n\n1\n\nFormulation of results\n\nCentral extensions of the groups of symplectomorphisms discussed in this paper\nappeared as a byproduct in [25]. Here we prove several nontrivality and triviality\ntheorems concerning this cocycle.\n1.1. Preliminaries. Cocycle on the symplectic group Sp(2n, R). We\ndefine the real symplectic group Sp(2n, R) as the group of real matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\ng=\n(1.1)\nC D\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\npreserving the standard skew-symmetric bilinear form K :=\n, i.e.\n\u22121 0\ng t Kg = K\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe complex symplectic group Sp(2n, C) is the group of complex matrices satisfying the same condition (1.2).\nConsider the block (n + n) \u00d7 (n + n) matrix J \u2208 Sp(2n, C) given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 i\nJ= \u221a\n(1.3)\n2 i 1\nFor g \u2208 Sp(2n, R), we consider the matrix J \u22121 gJ \u2208 Sp(2n, C), this matrix\nhas the structure\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a6 \u03a8\nJ \u22121 gJ =\n\u03a8 \u03a6\nwhere bar means the element-wise complex conjugation. We denote\n\u03a6 = \u03a6(g);\n\n\u03a8 = \u03a8(g)\n\nWe define the Berezin cocycle\nc : Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 Sp(2n, R) \u2192 R\n1 Partially\n\nsupported by the grant NWO.047.017.015 and the grant FWF, project P19064\n\n1\n\n\fby2\n\ni\nh\nc(g1 , g2 ) = Im tr ln \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a6(g1 g2 )(\u03a6(g2 )\u22121\n\n(1.4)\n\nBelow (Theorem 2.1) we show that the matrix in the brackets has the form\n1 + Z, where kZk < 1. Then ln(1 + Z) := Z \u2212 Z 2 /2 + Z 3/3 \u2212 . . . and hence our\nexpression is well defined.\nThe cocycle c defines a central extension of Sp(2n, R). In other words, the\nset Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 R with the multiplication\n(g, x) * (h, y) = (gh, x + y + c(g, h))\nis a group.\n1.2. Groups of symplectomorphisms. Notation. Consider a 2ndimensional symplectic manifold M . Define the following groups\n- Symp(M ) is the group of all C \u221e -smooth compactly supported symplectomorphisms of M . If the manifold M itself is compact, then Symp(M ) is the\ngroup of all symplectomorphisms of M .\n- SSymp(M ) is the connected component of Symp(M ) containing unit e.\n- SSymp\u223c (M ) is the universal covering group of SSymp(M ).\n- More generally, we denote the universal covering of any connceted group\nG by G\u223c\n- Map(M ) is the mapping class group Symp(M )/SSymp(M ).\nWe have a natural topology on Symp(M ) and hence we have a natural Borel\nstructure on Symp(M ). In particular, we have a notion of a measurable function\non Symp(M ). Let F be a measurable function on Symp(M ), let U \u2282 RN be\nan open domain and \u03c8 : U 7\u2192 Symp(M ) be a smooth map. Then F \u25e6 \u03c8 is a\nmeasurable function on U in the usual sense.\n1.3. Central extension of the group of symplectomorphisms. Equip\nthe space R2n with the standard symplectic structure. Consider an open set\n\u03a9 \u2282 R2n and a symplectic embedding \u03b9 : \u03a9 \u2192 M such that the measure of\nM \\ \u03b9(\u03a9) is zero.\nRemarks. a) We admit disconnected sets \u03a9.\nb) It is pleasant (but not necessary) to think that M \\ \u03b9(\u03a9) is a union of\nsubmanifolds.\nAny element g \u2208 Symp(M ) induces a transformation \u03b9\u22121 g\u03b9 of \u03a9 defined almost everywhere. Denote the group of all such transformations by Symp(M, \u03a9, \u03b9).\nBy the definition, Symp(M, \u03a9, \u03b9) \u2243 Symp(M ). This group contains Symp(\u03a9)\nas a proper subgroup.\nFor q \u2208 Symp(M, \u03a9, \u03b9) and x \u2208 \u03a9, we denote by q \u2032 (x) its Jacobi matrix at\nthe point x. We define the 2-cocycle C(q1 , q2 ), where q1 , q2 \u2208 Symp(M, \u03a9, \u03b9),\n2 In\n\nconciderations of Subsection 4.2, this formula arises in a natural way\n\n2\n\n\fby the formula3\nC(q1 , q2 ) =\nZ\nn\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003o\n=\nIm tr ln \u03a6\u22121 q1\u2032 (q2 (m) \u03a6 q1\u2032 (q2 (m))q2\u2032 (m) \u03a6\u22121 q2\u2032 (m) dm =\n\u03a9\nZ\n\u0001\nc q1\u2032 (q2 (m)), q2\u2032 (m) dm (1.5)\n\u03a9\n\nTheorem 1.1 a) The expression C(q1 , q2 ) defines an element of the second\ncohomology group H 2 (Symp(M ), R). In another words, the space Symp(M ) \u00d7 R\nwith the product\n(q1 , x1 ) \u00d7 (q2 , x2 ) = (q1 \u25e6 q2 , x1 + x2 + C(q1 , q2 ))\n\n(1.6)\n\nis a group.\nb) This central extension of Symp(M ) does not depend on a choice of the\ndomain \u03a9 and the map \u03b9.\n1.4. Triviality results for the cocycle C. We have a map from the\nuniversal covering group SSymp\u223c (M ) to SSymp(M ) and hence we can consider\nthe cocycle C as a cocycle on SSymp\u223c (M ).\nProposition 1.2 Let \u039e \u2282 R2n be an open domain. Then the central extension\nof SSymp\u223c (\u039e) defined by the cocycle C is trivial.\nLet M be a symplectic manifold. Consider an almost complex structure\non the tangent bundle of M compatible with the symplectic structure (in particular, we obtain n-dimensional complex vector bundle). Assume that the\ncorresponding Hermitian metric is positive definite.\nFor the complex bundle obtained in this way, consider its n-th exterior power\nL.\nProposition 1.3 If the complex line bundle L on M is trivial, then the central\nextension of SSymp\u223c (M ) defined by the cocycle C is trivial.\nCorollary 1.4 For a noncompact 2-dimensional surfaces M of a finite genus,\nour cocycle is trivial on SSymp(M).\nIndeed, in this case, the group SSymp(M) is contractible, see [10], hence\nSSymp\u223c (M) = SSymp(M). Also, in this case, the line bundle L is trivial.\nThus, by Proposition 1.3, our central extension is trivial.\n1.5. Nontriviality results.\n3 This cocycle is induced from a cocycle on the group of measurable currents, see below\nSubsection 2.4. Also, below we propose a coordinate-less description of the cocycle C, see\nSubsection 2.9.\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.5 For a two-dimensional oriented (compact or noncompact) surface Mg of genus g \u2265 3, our central extension of Symp(Mg ) is nontrivial in\nmeasurable cohomologies.\nFurther, consider the standard lattice Z2n in the standard symplectic space\nR . Consider the torus T2n := R2n /Z2n . Denote by Sp(2n, Z) the subgroup in\nSp(2n, R) consisting of all matrices (1.1) with integer elements.\nThe action of Sp(2n, Z) on R2n induces the symplectic action of Sp(2n, Z)\non T2n .\n2n\n\nTheorem 1.6 The central extension of Symp(T2n ) defined by the cocycle C is\nnontrivial for n \u2265 3.\nIn fact, we prove that this extension is nontrivial on the countable subgroup\nSp(2n, Z) \u2282 Symp(T2n ). The latter statement is a kind of a rigidity theorem\nfor lattices.\n1.6. Some discussion.\na) Central extensions of of SSymp(M ) were discussed in several works, see\nKostant [9], Brylinski [6], Ismagilov [16], [17], Haller, Vizman [14]. Our construction differs from these constructions.\nb) Consider a surface Mg of genus \u2265 3. It seems that our central extension\nin this case must be related to the Harer central extension [15] of the mapping\nclass group Map(Mg ), see also [11].\nBut this relation now is not clear. Indeed, Symp(Mg ) is not a semidirect\nproduct Map(Mg ) \u22c9 SSymp(Mg ) and hence our construction does not induce\nautomatically an extension of Map(Mg ).\nSecond, the central extension of Map(Mg ) induces a central extension of\nSymp(Mg ). Unfortunately, I do not know, gives our construction the same\nresult or not.\nc) Symplectic mapping class groups in higher dimensions were discussed by\nSeidel, see [27]; for results and references on topology of groups of symplectomorphisms, see surveys [20], [21].\nd) For a two-dimensional surface Mg , our central extension can be realized in\na unitary representation of Symp(Mg ), this construction was obtained in [24].\nI do not believe that a realization in a unutary representation is possible for\ndimensions \u2265 4 (realizations in nonunitary representations exist).\n1.7.

Central extensions. Preliminaries. A. Let G be a group, let A be\nan Abelian group (in our work, A is the additive group of R, Z, or the circle\nT := R/Z, we write the operation in A in the additive form). A central extension\ne such that A is a central\nof G by the group A (or A-extension of G) is a group G\ne\ne\nsubgroup in G and G/A \u2243 G.\ne can be identified noncanonically with the product G \u00d7 A and the\nThe set G\ne \u2192 G can be identified with the projection G \u00d7 A \u2192 G. Then\nhomomorphism G\nthe multiplication in G \u00d7 A must have the form\n\u0001\n(g1 , a1 ) * (g2 , a2 ) = g1 g2 , a1 + a2 + c(g1 , g2 )\n(2.1)\nwhere the function c : G \u00d7 G \u2192 A (a 2-cocycle) satisfies the identities\nc(e, g) = c(g, e) = 0\n\nfor all g ;\n\n(2.2)\n\nc(g1 , g2 ) + c(g1 g2 , g3 ) = c(g1 , g2 g3 ) + c(g2 , g3 )\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere e is the unit of G. The first condition means that (e, 0) is the unit of\ne The second condition is equivalent to the associativity of the multiplication\nG.\n(2.1).\ne then c(g1 , g2 ) is changed\nB. If we change the identification G \u00d7 A and G,\naccording the rule\nc(g1 , g2 ) 7\u2192 c(g1 , g2 ) \u2212 \u03b3(g1 ) \u2212 \u03b3(g2 ) + \u03b3(g1 g2 )\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u03b3 : G \u2192 A is some function such that \u03b3(e) = 0.\nThe central extension is trivial if c(g1 , g2 ) can be transformed to 0 by the\noperation (2.4), i.e.,\nc(g1 , g2 ) = \u03b3(g1 ) + \u03b3(g2 ) \u2212 \u03b3(g1 g2 )\n\n(2.5)\n\ne = G \u00d7 A and we say that \u03b3(g) is a trivializer of c.\nIn this case G\nC. If \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 are two trivializers of the same cocycle c, then \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 is a homomorphism G \u2192 A.\nD. The additive group of functions c(g1 , g2 ) satisfying (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is denoted\nby C 2 (G, A) (group of cocycles); the group of functions having the form (2.5) is\ndenoted by B 2 (G, A) (the group of coboundaries). The second cohomology group\nis the factor-group\nH 2 (G, A) := C 2 (G, A)/B 2 (G, A)\nE. Let B be an Abelian group, A be its subgroup, C = B/A be the factorgroup. Then we have the obvious maps\nC 2 (G, A) \u2192 C 2 (G, B) \u2192 C 2 (G, C);\n5\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fThe first map means that an A-valued function c is also a B-valued function;\nconsidering a composition of a function G \u00d7 G \u2192 B and the homomorphism\nB \u2192 C, we obtain the second map. We also have the corresponding map in\ncohomologies\nH 2 (G, A) \u2192 H 2 (G, B) \u2192 H 2 (G, C)\n(2.7)\n\nF. Let G, G\u2032 be groups, let \u03b8 : G\u2032 \u2192 G be a homomorphism. Then \u03b8\ninduces a natural map C 2 (G, A) \u2192 C 2 (G\u2032 , A), i.e., for a cocycle c \u2208 C 2 (G, A)\nwe consider the cocycle c(\u03b8(g1\u2032 ), \u03b8(g2\u2032 )) \u2208 C 2 (G\u2032 , A). Hence we also have a map\nof cohomologies\nH 2 (G, A) \u2192 H 2 (G\u2032 , A)\nG. Let G be a group, fix h \u2208 G.\nThe cocycle c(h\u22121 g1 h, h\u22121 g2 h) is equivalent to c(g1 , g2 ), see [5], III.8.1.\nH. Now let G, A be topological groups. We say that a cocycle c \u2208 H 2 (G, A)\nis nontrivial in measurable cohomologies if it can not be trivialized (see (2.6))\nby a measurable trivializer \u03b3.\n\n2.2. A model of Sp(2n, R).

Denote by VR the same space considered as 2ndimensional linear space over R. The operator v 7\u2192 iv in V is also a linear\noperator in VR , we denote it by I.\nDenote by {*, *} the imaginary part of the Hermitian form H, it is a skewsymmetric bilinear form on VR . The group preserving this form is Sp(2n, R).\nConsider the complexification (VR )C of the space VR . It is a 2n-dimensional\ncomplex linear space equipped with several additional structures\n1) We have an operator I such that I 2 = \u22121.\n2) Since I 2 = \u22121, the eigenvalues of I are \u00b1i. Denote by V\u00b1 the corresponding eigenspaces. Then V = V+ \u2295 V\u2212 .\n6\n\n\f3) We have the operation Q of complex conjugation Q : v + iw 7\u2192 v \u2212 iw,\nwhere v, w \u2208 VR . It satisfies QV\u00b1 = V\u2213\nNow we consider the action of Sp(2n, R) in (VR )C . An operator g \u2208 Sp(2n, R)\npreserves the bilinear form in (VR )C and commutes with the complex conjugation.\nRepresenting it as a block operator V+ \u2295 V\u2212 \u2192 V+ \u2295 V\u2212 , we obtain the block\nmatrix representation (2.8)\nThe Hermitian form M on (VR )C is\nM (v + iw, v \u2032 + iw\u2032 ) = {v, w\u2032 } \u2212 {w, v \u2032 } + i{v, v \u2032 } + i{w, w\u2032 }\nit is more natural to say that we extend i{*, *} as an Hermitian form from VR to\n(VR )C .\n2.3. The Berezin cocycle on Sp(2n, R).\nTheorem 2.1 a) The function Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 Sp(2n, R) \u2192 R given by\ni\nh\nc(g1 , g2 ) = Im tr ln \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a6(g1 g2 )(\u03a6(g2 )\u22121\n\n(2.10)\n\nis well-defined.\nb) The function c(g1 , g2 ) is a 2-cocycle.\n1\nc) The R-valued cocycle 2\u03c0\nc(g1 , g2 ) can be reduced to a Z-valued cocycle.4\nThe corresponding Z-extension of Sp(2n, R) coincides with the universal covering group of Sp(2n, R).\nd) The cocycle c is uniformly bounded on Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 Sp(2n, R)\n|c(g1 , g2 )| < n\u03c0/2\n\n(2.11)\n\nRemark. In [3], Berezin wrote the following T-cocycle on Sp(2n, R) and on\nits infinite-dimensional analogue\n\u03c3(g1 , g2 ) = det(1 + \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a8(g1 ) * \u03a8(g2 )\u03a6(g2 )\u22121 )\u22121/2\nTrivial calculation shows that\n\u03c3(g1 , g2 ) = exp{\u2212c(g1 , g2 )/2}\nThis cocycle can be trivialized on the two-sheet covering of Sp(2n, R). For n = 1,\nan explicit formula for R-valued cocycle c was written by Guichardet [13].\nProof. a) We have\n\u03a6(g1 g2 ) = \u03a6(g1 )\u03a6(g2 ) + \u03a8(g1 )\u03a8(g2 )\nHence\n\u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a6(g1 g2 )\u03a6(g2 )\u22121 = 1 + \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a8(g1 ) * \u03a8(g2 )\u03a6(g2 )\u22121\n4 I.e.,\n\nc is contained in the image of the map H 2 (Sp(2n, R), Z) \u2192 H 2 (Sp(2n, R), R).\n\n7\n\n(2.12)\n\n\fEquations (2.9) imply\n\u03a6\u2217 \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8 t \u03a8 = 1\n\n\u03a6\u03a6\u2217 \u2212 \u03a8\u03a8\u2217 = 1;\n\n(2.13)\n\nHence \u03a6 is invertible and we have the following inequalities for norms\nk\u03a6\u22121 \u03a8k < 1,\n\nk\u03a8\u03a6\u22121 k < 1\n\n(2.14)\n\nThus,\nk\u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a8(g1 ) * \u03a8(g2 )\u03a6(g2 )\u22121 k < 1\nWe define the logarithm of (2.12) by\nln(1 + Z) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n+1 Z n /n\n\nn=1\n\nSince the norm of our Z is < 1, our series converges.\nb) Let A, B be n \u00d7 n matrices and kA \u2212 1k, kB \u2212 1k be sufficiently small.\nThen\ntr ln(AB) = tr ln A + tr ln B\nHence, for g1 , g2 lying in a small neighborhood of the unit we can write\ni\nh\ntr ln \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a6(g1 g2 )\u03a6(g2 )\u22121 = \u2212tr ln \u03a6(g1 ) + tr ln \u03a6(g1 g2 ) \u2212 tr ln \u03a6(g2 )\n\nNow the cocycle identity (2.3) became trivial for g1 , g2 , g3 lying in a sufficiently\nsmall neighborhood of unit.\nBut all our expressions are real analytic and the group Sp(2n, R) is connected. Hence the cocycle identity (2.3) is valid for all g1 , g2 , g3 \u2208 Sp(2n, R).\nA verifying of (2.2) is trivial.\nc) As we have seen det \u03a6 6= 0. Assume\n\u03b3(g) := Im tr ln \u03a6(g) = arg ln det \u03a6(g)\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 arg z < 2\u03c0. Obviously,\n\u03b1 :=\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nc(g1 , g2 ) + \u03b3(g1 ) + \u03b3(g2 ) \u2212 \u03b3(g1 g2 ) \u2208 Z\n2\u03c0\n\nsince exp(2\u03c0\u03b1) = 1, and the first statement is proved.\nThe Z-central extension of Sp(2n, R) obtained in this way can be considered\nas the subset Sp(2n, R)\u223c \u2282 Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 R consisting of pairs\n(g, x),\n\nwhere g \u2208 Sp(2n, R), x \u2208 R and det \u03a6(g)/| det \u03a6(g)| = eix ,\n\nthe multiplication is given by (2.1). Obviously, the projection Sp(2n, R)\u223c \u2192\nSp(2n, R) is a covering map. For y \u2208 R consider the matrix g(y) with \u03a8(y) = 0\nand \u03a6 being the diagonal matrix with entries eiy , 1,. . . , 1. The map y 7\u2192\n8\n\n\f(g(y), y) is a continuous map R \u2192 Sp(2n, R)\u223c and hence Sp(2n, R)\u223c is connected. Thus Sp(2n, R)\u223c is a covering group for Sp(2n, R).\nIt remains to notice that the unitary group U(n) is a deformation retract\nof Sp(2n, R) and the loop g(y), y \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], is a generator of the fundamental\ngroup \u03c01 (U(n)). Hence Sp(2n, R)\u223c is a universal covering of Sp(2n, R).\nd) Let Z be a matrix satisfying kZk < 1. Let \u03bbj (Z) be its eigenvalues.\nObviously, |\u03bbj | < 1. Let us prove that\nX\ntr ln(1 + Z) =\nln(1 + \u03bbj (Z))\n(2.16)\n\nFor a self-adjoint matrix Z this identity is obvious. The both sides of (2.16) are\ncomplex analytic in Z and hence this identity is valid if kZk < 1.\nBut |\u03bbj (Z)| < 1 implies |Im (1 + \u03bbj )| < \u03c0/2 and we obtain (2.11).\n\u0003\nRemark. Obviously, the expression\nh\ni\nRe tr ln \u03a6(g1 )\u22121 \u03a6(g1 g2 )(\u03a6(g2 )\u22121\nalso satisfies the cocycle equation (2.3), but this cocycle is trivial, since its\ntrivializer\n\u03b3(g) = Re tr ln \u03a6(g) = ln | det(\u03a6(g))|\n\nis well defined (but similar expression (2.15) is multivalued).\n2.4. Groups B(X, G). Denote by X some Lebesgue space with a continuous measure5 \u03bc. For example, we can consider X being an arbitrary symplectic\nmanifold. Denote by Ams(X) the group of all measure-preserving maps from\nthe space X to itself (by definition, these maps are defined almost everywhere).\nLet G be an arbitrary group (below G = Sp(2n, R)). Denote by F(X, G) the\ngroup of all measurable functions f : X \u2192 G such that\nf (x) = 1\n\noutside a set of finite measure\n\nIf X itself has a finite measure, then we can forget the last condition.\nConsider the semidirect product\nB(X, G) = Ams(X) \u22c9 F(X, G)\nElements of the group B(X, G) are pairs {p, h} \u2208 Ams \u00d7 F(X, G) and the\nproduct is given by\n{p1 (x), h1 (x)} \u2217 {p2 (x), h2 (x)} := {p1 (p2 (x)), h1 (p2 (x))h2 (x)}\nRemark. Let the group G acts on a manifold Y by transformations y 7\u2192 yg.\nConsider the space L(X, Y ) of all Y -valued measurable functions on X. The\ngroup B(X, G) acts in this space by the transformations\nT (p, h)f (x) = f (p(x))h(x)\n\n(2.17)\n\n5 In fact, any such space is equivalent to a segment [a, b] \u2282 R equipped with the Lebesgue\nmeasure or to the whole line R.\n\n9\n\n\f2.5. A central extension of B(X, G). Let c \u2208 H 2 (G, R) be a bounded\ncocycle. We define the function C : B(X, G) \u00d7 B(X, G) \u2192 R by\nZ\n\u0001\nC({p1 , h1 }, {p2 , h2 } =\nc h1 \u25e6 p2 (x), h2 (x) d\u03bc(x)\n(2.18)\nX\n\nTheorem 2.2 The function C is a 2-cocycle on B(X, G).\ne\nG).\nWe denote the corresponding central extension of B(X, G) by B(X,\nProof.

To apply this construction, we need in a group G, having a nontrivial R-central extension. Some reasonable examples are G = R/Z, U(p, q),\nSO\u2217 (2n), SO(n, 2), and the group SDiff(S 1 ) of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle.\n2.6.

Embedding Symp(M ) \u2192 B(M, Sp(2n, R)). Now let X \u2243 M be a\n2n-dimensional symplectic manifold, let \u03a9 \u2282 R2n be an open domain, and let\n\u03b9 : \u03a9 \u2192 M be a symplectic embedding such that the set M \\ \u03b9(\u03a9) has a zero\nmeasure. For g \u2208 Symp(M ), consider the map q := \u03b9\u22121 g\u03b9 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9 defined\nalmost sure. Denote by q \u2032 (x) the Jacobi matrix of g at point x.\nThe map\ng 7\u2192 (q, q \u2032 )\n\nis an embedding Symp(M ) \u2192 B(M, Sp(2n, R)). Our cocycle (1.5) on Symp is\ninduced from the cocycle (2.18) on B(M, Sp(2n, R).\n2.8. Groups of automorphisms Aut(R, M ) of bundles. Now let X = M\nbe an m-dimensional manifold equipped with a volume form \u03a9. Consider an 2ndimensional real vector bundle R \u2192 M on M with fibers Rx , x \u2208 M . Assume\nthat fibers Rx are equipped with skew-symmetric bilinear forms {*, *}x .\nDenote by Aut(R, M ) the group of smooth maps \u0398 : R \u2192 R satisfying the\nconditions\n1. An image of any fiber Rx is some fiber R\u03b8(x) , and the map \u0398 induces a\nlinear map Rx to R\u03b8(x) preserving the skew-symmetric form, i.e.,\n{\u0398v, \u0398w}\u03be(x) = {v, w}x\nwhere v, w \u2208 Rx .\n2. The map x 7\u2192 \u03b8(x) is a diffeomorphism of the base M preserving the\nvolume form \u03a9.\n3. For a noncompact manifold M , we have an additional conditions: there is\na compact subset L \u2282 M such that for any x \u2208\n/ L we have \u03b8(x) = x and \u0398v = v\nfor any v \u2208 Rx .\nThe group Aut(R, M ) admits an obvious embedding to the group B(M, Sp(2n, R)).\nIndeed, consider an arbitrary trivialization of the bundle R over an arbitrary\nopen set X \u2282 M of a complete measure. Then elements of Aut(R, M ) induce\ntransformations of L(X, R2n ) of the type (2.17).\nThe embedding Aut(R, M ) \u2192 B(M, Sp(2n, R)) described above is not canonical, but any two embeddings \u03b71 , \u03b72 of this type are conjugated by some element\nr \u2208 B(M, Sp(2n, R)):\n\u03b72 (\u0398) = r\u22121 \u03b71 (\u0398)r\n(2.23)\nThus, the central extension of B(M, Sp(2n, R) induces a central extension of\nthe group Aut(R, M ). The formula for the cocycle depends on the set X \u2282 M\nand on a trivialization of the bundle. But due (2.23) all these cocycles are\nequivalent. Thus, our central extension is canonical.\n2.9. A geometric construction of the central extension of Aut(R, M ).\nLet R, M be the same as above.\n\n11\n\n\fConsider an almost complex structure on the bundle R. Recall that this is\nan operator Jx : Rx \u2192 Rx depending on x smoothly and satisfying\nJx2 = \u22121;\n\n{Jx v, Jx w}x = {v, w}x\n\nWe also assume that the symmetric bilinear form\nSx (v, w) = {Jx v, w}x\nis positive definite on each fiber. Such almost complex structures exist, see, for\ninstance, [22] (evidently, such structure is not unique). In particular, the tangent\nbundle T M became a complex n-dimensional bundle, but in this moment we\nprefer to consider T M is a real bundle with an additional structure.\nConsider the fiber-wise complexification RC of the vector bundle R \u2192 M .\nIn each fiber (Rx )C of RC , we have two canonically defined subspaces\n(Rx )C = Rx+ \u2295 Rx\u2212\n\nRx\u00b1 := ker(Jx \u2213 i),\n\nThus we can represent any real symplectic linear operator h : Rx \u2192 Ry as a\ncomplex block operator\nh : Rx+ \u2295 Rx\u2212 \u2192 Ry+ \u2295 Ry\u2212\nWe denote by \u03a6(h) the block corresponding Rx+ \u2192 Ry+ .\nThe formula for the 2-cocycle is\nZ \u0010\n(1)\n(2)\n, \u0398(2)\nC(\u0398 , \u0398 ) =\nc (\u0398(1)\nR\u03b8(2) (x)\n\nM\n\nRx\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03a9(x)\n\n2.10. Groups of symplectomorphisms. Now let M be a 2n-dimensional\nsymplectic manifold. Denote by R the tangent bundle to M . We have the\nnatural embedding\nSymp(M ) \u2282 Aut(R, M )\nand hence we can induce a 2-cocycle from the group Aut(R, M ).\nWe also can put Symp(M ) to B(M, Sp(2n, R)) directly, as it was done above\nin 1.3.\nThe cohomological class of the induced cocycle do not depend on the embeddings since all these embeddings are conjugated by interior automorphisms\nof B(M, Sp(2n, R)).\n2.11.

Generally, this trivializer is not unique, since (see 2.1) there are\nnontrivial homomorphisms SSymp(\u039e)\u223c \u2192 R, namely the flux homomorphisms\nand the Calabi invariant (see, for instance [1], [22], we discuss them below in a\nspecial case). By the Banyaga Theorem [1], this list exhaust all the homomorphisms from SSymp\u223c to Abelian groups.\nCorollary 2.3 Let \u039e \u2282 R4 be an open domain. Then our central extension of\nthe (disconnected) group Symp(\u039e) is trivial.\nIndeed, the group Symp(R4 ) is connected and contractible (Gromov [12]).\nBy Proposition 1.2, its central extension is trivial.

In the case of general symplectic manifolds M , the sense of the expression (2.24) is not clear, since an operator \u03a6(*)\nmaps one fiber of a bundle to another one and hence its determinant is not well\ndefined.\nConsider an Hermitian structure on the tangent bundle T M to M compatible with the symplectic form (as in 2.9). Then T M becomes a complex bundle,\n13\n\n\fdenote it by TM (it is also isomorphic to the subbundle R+ \u2282 RC defined\nabove). Consider its maximal exterior power \u2227n TM .\nAssume that the bundle \u2227n TM is trivial. Fix its trivialization. This precisely means that we have defined determinants of the operators \u03a6(*) connecting\ndifferent fibers.\nThen we repeat our argument with a covering homotopy and obtain Proposition 1.3.\n\n3\n\nTwo-dimensional surfaces\n\nHere we prove nontriviality of the cocycle C in the case of a two-dimensional\noriented surface M of genus g \u2265 3.

The identity component\nSSymp(\u2206) is contractible (Earle, Eells [10]).\nOur main arguments for a proof are: continuity of the cocycle in the topology\nof convergence in measure, formula (2.25) for a trivializer in a flat case, a certain\nDehn relation in the Teichmuller group, and the Banyaga Theorem.\n3.1.

The image of a right twist under the orientation preserving map\n(r, \u03c6) 7\u2192 (ab/r, \u2212\u03c6) is a right twist again. A diffeomorphism inverse to a right\ntwist is not a right twist (it is called a left twist).\n\u0003\nConsider a closed smooth non-self-intersecting curve C on the surface M.\nConsider a 'small' neighborhood U of C. For some standard ring S \u2282 R2\nconsider some area-preserving and orientation preserving diffeomorphism p :\nS \u2192 U .

For any two nonseparating curves B1 , B2 there is a\ndiffeomorphism q \u2208 Symp(M) such that q(B1 ) = B2 (see, for instance, [18]). If\nh is a right twist about B1 , then q \u22121 hq is a right twist about B2 .\n3.3. \u03b5-twists. Below we use families of twists depending on parameters\nand we are need in some uniform estimates in parameters. By this reason, we\ngive more rigid definitions.\nFix a function \u03bd on (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) satisfying the conditions\n\u2013 \u03bd = 0 on the ray (\u2212\u221e, 0) and \u03bd = 2\u03c0 on the ray x \u2265 1/2\n17\n\n\f\u2013 \u03bd is C \u221e -smooth and increasing.\nThis function remains fixed until the end of this section.\nA standard \u03b5-twist is a family q(\u03b5) of diffeomorphisms of the ring 1/2 < r <\n3/2 depending in a parameter \u03b5, they have the form\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nr, \u03c6 7\u2192 r, \u03c6 + \u03bd r\u22121\n,\n0 < \u03b5 < 1/2\n\u03b5\n\n(in particular, this map is identical outside the ring 1 < r < 1 + \u03b5/2).\nNow let C be a closed non-self-intersecting curve on M. Let h be an embedding of some ring 1 \u2212 \u03b4 < r < 1 + \u03b4 to M such that the C is the image of the\ncircle r = 1.

The strip U(\u03b5) separates \u039b into two domains, i.e., the exterior domain W ext and the interior domain W int . Let l(t) be a (short) curve intersecting\nthe strip U(\u03b5), let l(0) \u2208 W ext , l(\u03b4) \u2208 W int . The Jacobi matrix [T\u2032B \u25e6l](t) is 1 at\nt = 0 and at t = \u03b4. But the curve [T\u2032 \u25e6 l](t) is noncontractible in SL(2, (R)) and\nmoreover, it is a generator of the fundamental group \u03c01 (SL2 (R)) ( it is sufficient\nto verify that the vector [T\u2032B \u25e6 l](t)l\u0307(t) is turning by the angle 2\u03c0 as we pass\nl(t)).\nHence ln \u03a6(T\u2032B (l(\u03b4)) = 2\u03c0, and thus ln \u03a6(T\u2032B (x)) = 2\u03c0 for x \u2208 W int .\nFurther,\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0393\u25e6 (TB (\u03b5)) =\nIm ln \u03a6(T\u2032B (x)) dx =\n+\n+\nW ext\n\n\u039b\n\n18\n\nU(\u03b5)\n\nW int\n\n\fThe integrand in the first summand is 0, the integrand in the last summand is\n2\u03c0 (and hence the integral over W int is 2\u03c0\u03c3(S) + O(\u03b5)). Thus it is sufficient to\nshow that \u03b3 \u25e6 = Im ln \u03a6(T\u2032B (x)) is bounded in the thin strip U(\u03b5). By Lemma\n3.4, it is sufficient to show the boundedness of Ang(TB , x, v), and by Lemma\n3.3, the latter statement is obvious.\n\u0003.\n2\n3.5. Flux homomorphisms.

In a general case, flux homomorphisms are defined on the connected group SSymp. In our case, we obtain homomorphisms \u03c4j of group\nSymp(\u2206), these homomorphisms depend on an embedding of the symplectic\nmanifold \u2206 to R2 , since the areas of the holes Zj participate in formula (3.8)\n3.6.

Consider a 1-form \u03bb on R2 such that d\u03bb = \u03c9.\nFor g \u2208 SSymp(\u039b), the form g \u2217 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb is closed and hence it is exact.\nHence\ng \u2217 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb = dF\n(3.9)\nThe function F is defined up to an additive constant.

It can easily be checked that \u03ba(g) does\nnot depend on a choice of a potential \u03bb. The homomorphism \u03ba(g) is called by\nthe Calabi invariant.\nNext, we restrict the Calabi invariant to the group Symp(\u2206) \u2282 SSymp(\u039b)\nand hence we obtain the homomorphisms Symp(\u2206) \u2192 R.\nRemark. In general situation, the Calabi invariant is defined on the kernel\nof all the flux homomorphisms \u2282 Symp. In our case, it is defined globally, but\nits definition is not canonical, it depends on an embedding of the symplectic\ndomain \u2206 to R2 . Indeed, formula (3.10) includes integration over the holes,\nthis operation is not invariantly defined on the manifold \u2206. But these integrals\nover the holes give a linear combination of flux homomorphisms.\nBy the Banyaga Theorem (see [1], see also some useful additions in Rousseau\n[26], see also [2]), the intersection of the kernels of all the flux homomorphisms\nand of the kernel of the Calabi invariant is a perfect group (i.e., it has no homomorphisms to Abelian groups; moreover, this intersection is a simple group).\nThus, in our case, each measurable6 homomorphism SSymp(\u2206) \u2192 R is a\nlinear combination of k flux homomorphisms \u03c4j and of the Calabi invariant \u03ba.\n3.8.

It remains to\nshow that F is uniformly bounded in x and \u03b5 in the strip U(\u03b5).\nThe value of F (l(s)) for 0 < s < 1 is the integral of \u03bb over a nonclosed curve\nL composed from l(t) and T(l(t)) with 0 < t < s (l(t) is passed in the inverse\ndirection). We include this curve into a closed contour C adding the direct\nsegments [0, l(0)], [0, l(s)]. The integral of \u03bb over these segments vanishes.\nHence, by the Green formula, F (l(s)) is the oriented area of the curvilinear\nsector bounded by the contour C. Obviously, this area is uniformly bounded.\n\u0003\n3.9. Preliminary remarks on trivializers. First, let us consider a domain \u03a9 \u2282 R2 and a map \u03b9 : \u03a9 \u2192 M as in 1.3.

Asymptotics for a single twist. Consider a nonseparating non selfintersecting curve C on the surface. Consider a ring \u0398 \u2283 C, identify this ring\nwith a subdomain in the flat circle \u039b. Our cocycle must be trivial on the group\nSymp(\u0398) of symplectomorphisms of \u0398. On another side, our central extension\nadmits a canonical trivialization \u0393\u25e6 on the group SSymp(\u039b) \u2283 Symp(\u0398). Hence\n\u0393(q) = \u0393\u25e6 (q) + u(q),\n\nq \u2208 Symp(\u0398)\n\nwhere u is a homomorphism Symp(\u0398) \u2192 R).\nThe group Symp(\u0398) is a semidirect product Z\u22c9SSymp(\u0398). Let \u03be \u2208 Symp(\u0398)\nbe a generator of the mapping class group Symp(\u0398)/SSymp(\u0398). Then q =\n\u03be n \u25e6 q \u2217 , where q \u2217 \u2208 SSymp(\u0398). Hence the homomorphism u(q) must have a\nform\nu(q) = n * u(\u03be) + a\u03c4 (q \u2217 ) + b\u03ba(q)\nNow let q = TC (\u03b5). Then all the terms of \u0393(q) have asymptotics of the form\nconst + O(\u03b5) (for \u0393\u25e6 , see Lemma 3.6; for \u03ba, see Lemma 3.9; for \u03c4 this is moreor-less obvious).\nCoincidence of asymtotics for different twists. Let B, C be two nonseparating non self-intersecting curves on M. Let us show, that there exists r \u2208\nSymp(M) such that\nTC (\u03b5) = rTB (\u03b5)r\u22121\nfor sufficiently small \u03b5. Indeed, by definition of \u03b5-twists, we have fixed diffeomorphisms hB , hC from some ring 1 \u2212 \u03b4 < r < 1 + \u03b4 to some strips UB (\u03b4), UC (\u03b4)\nabout B, C. For m \u2208 UB (\u03b4), we define r as r(m) = hC \u25e6 h\u22121\nB (m). After this\nwe extend r to M \\ UB in an arbitrary way. This is possible since M \\ UB and\nM \\ UB are symplectomorphic.\nNow consider the corresponding elements of Symp(M, \u03a9, \u03b9). We preserve for\nthem the same notation. We have\n^\ne C (\u03b5) re = T^\ne B (\u03b5)\nT\neT\nC (\u03b5)r = rTB (\u03b5) = r\n\nEvaluating the trivializer for the first and the last terms of this chain we obtain\n\u0393(TC (\u03b5)) + \u0393(r) + C(TC (\u03b5), r) = \u0393(r) + \u0393(TB (\u03b5)) + C(r, TB (\u03b5))\nBy Lemma 3.10, we have \u0393(TC (\u03b5)) \u2212 \u0393(TB (\u03b5)) = O(\u03b5).\n\n\u0003\nb\n3.10. Proof of Theorem 1.5. Now consider an open domain \u2206 on M\nb is\nhomeomorphic to a disk with 3 holes. Assume also that the set M \\ \u2206\nconnected. Since the genus is \u2265 3, this is possible. Now we define more precisely\nb and some\nthe set \u03a9 \u2282 R2 and the map \u03b9. Let \u03b9 identify symplectomorphically \u2206\n2\ndisk \u2206 with 3 holes on R ; denote by \u039b the simply connected domain inside the\nexterior boundary of \u2206.\nb we can choose the map \u03b9 in an arbitrary way.\nOn M \\ \u2206\nConsider 7 curves V0 , V1 , V2 , V3 , W1 , W2 , W3 as on Fig.2.\n22\n\n\fW3\nZ3\nV3\n\nV2\n\nZ2\n\nW1\nV1\nV0\n\nZ1\n\nW2\n\nZ0\n\nFigure 2: Notation for curves.

The diffeomorphism\n\u22121 \u22121\np(\u03b5) := TV0 TV1 TV2 TV3 T\u22121\nW1 TW2 TW3\n\nis isotopic to the identity map, and moreover, the isotopy can be done inside\nthe domain \u2206; this statement is the Dehn's latern relation in Teichmuller group\nrediscovered by Johnson, see [8], [19], [18]).\n\u0003\nAll our curves are nonseparating in M, and by Lemma 3.12 the trivializer \u0393\non each of our 7 twists is H + O(\u03b5). By Lemma 3.10,\n\u0393(p) = H + O(\u03b5),\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nIn particular, this means that the main tern of the asymptotics of \u0393(p(\u03b5)) is\ninvariant with respect to deformations of our seven curves V0 ,. . . .\nOn another hand, we have the trivializer \u0393\u25e6 of C(*, *) on SSymp(\u2206) described\nin 2.11 and given by (3.7). The difference of two trivializers is a homomorphism\nSSymp(\u2206) \u2192 R. Hence it must be a linear combination of 3 flux homomorphisms \u03c4j and the Calabi invariant.

In notation\nof 1.3, it is natural to consider \u03a9 = (0, 1)2n and the identical embedding \u03a9 \u2192\nRn \u2192 T2n . Then Theorem 1.6 is a corollary of the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.1 For n > 2, the R-valued cocycle c \u2208 H 2 (Sp(2n, R)) is nontrivial\non the group Sp(2n, Z).\n24\n\n\fFix \u03b1 > 0.

For integer \u03b1 the cocycle c\u03b1 is trivial on the whole group Sp(2n, R).\nRemark.\n\u0012\n\u0013 Consider the subgroup \u03931,2 \u2282 Sp(2n, Z) consisting of matrices\nA B\ng=\nsuch that diagonals entries of the matrices At C, B t D are even.\nC D\nThe cocycle c1/2 is trivial on \u03931,2 (see [23], Section II.5),\n4.2. Realization of the cocycle c\u03b1 in a representation. Denote by\nBn the set of complex symmetric (z = z t ) matrices with norm < 1 (the Cartan\nmatrix ball).\nThe symplectic group acts on Bn by the linear-fractional transformations\nz 7\u2192 z [g] = (\u03a6 + z\u03a8)\u22121 (\u03a8 + z\u03a6)\n\nFix \u03b1 > 0. Consider the representation Te\u03b1 of Sp(2n, R) in the space of\nholomorphic functions on Bn given by\nTe\u03b1 (g)f (z) = f (z [g] ) det(\u03a6 + z\u03a8)\u2212\u03b1\n\n(4.1)\n\nIt is a standard formula for a highest weight representation of the group Sp(2n, R).\nFor z \u2208 Bn , the matrix \u03a6 + z\u03a8 is nondegenerat, see (2.14). Hence the\nexpression\ndet(\u03a6 + z\u03a8)\u2212\u03b1 = det \u03a6\u2212\u03b1 det(1 + z\u03a8\u03a6\u22121 )\u2212\u03b1\nhas countable number of branches; they are enumerated by values of (det \u03a6)\u2212\u03b1 .\nThus Te\u03b1 is a projective representation of Sp(2n, R) (or representation of the\nuniversal covering group Sp(2n, R)\u223c ).\nNevertheless, we interpret the standard formula (4.1) in the following slightly\nnonstandard way. Let us consider the normalized operators T\u03b1 (g) given by\nT\u03b1 (g) = f (z [g] ) det(1 + z\u03a8\u03a6\u22121 )\u2212\u03b1\nThe expression\n(1 + z\u03a8\u03a6\u22121 )\u2212\u03b1 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u03b1)k z k\nk=0\n\nk!\n\n\u2212\u03a8\u03a6\u22121\n\n\u0001k\n\nis well defined as a sum of series.

For g1 , g2 near 1, it is proved by a trivial calculation. After this we\nconsider the analytic continuation in g1 , g2 .\n\u0003\nThe cocycles \u03c3\u03b1 are precisely the cocycles c\u03b1 in multiplicative notation. We\nintend to prove Theorem 4.2 in the following form:\nthe restriction of the representation T\u03b1 to Sp(2n, Z) can not be reduced to a\nlinear representation of Sp(2n, Z) by a correction of the form\nT\u03b1 (g) 7\u2192 \u03b3(g)T\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b3(g) \u2208 C\u2217\n\nwhere g ranges in Sp(2n, Z).\n4.3.
