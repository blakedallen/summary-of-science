However, the constant energy density of this solution makes it unphysical, at least when\n\u2217 E-mail: max@physics.muni.cz, Present address: Department of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Science,\nMasaryk University, Kotl\u00e1r\u0306sk\u00e1 2, 611 37 Brno, Czech Republic\n\u2020 E-mail: larsam@physto.se\n\n1\n\n\finterpreting it as an adiabatic perfect fluid since the speed of sound is then infinite. Although there are\nother known perfect fluid solutions, only a few of them satisfy the basic criteria of physicality, cf. [1] for\na comprehensive classification of known exact solutions. Several workers have also considered equilibrium\nmodels with pressure anisotropy, at least since the paper [2]. In many cases an \"exact solution\" is obtained\nthrough some ansatz which does not correspond to a particular matter description. Elastic matter, on\nthe other hand, gives rise to anisotropic pressures in a natural way and should moreover be relevant for\nmodelling of e.g. neutron stars since they are believed to have solid crusts and, perhaps, solid cores. The\ngeneral relativistic theory of elasticity has never been a very hot field of research, but over the years it\nhas generated quite a number of papers, most of which concern the theoretical formulation of the theory.\nDespite of this, the times when the theory \u2013 in its full nonlinear regime \u2013 has found its way into astrophysical\napplications are scarce.\nIn a recent paper by the present authors[3] (hereinafter paper I), we reconsidered the subject and applied\nit to static spherically symmetric (SSS) configurations. In particular we constructed elastic stellar models\nnumerically for a specific equation of state. In a subsequent paper[4] (paper II) we showed how to analyse the\nradial oscillations of elastic stars and found, in particular, that the models constructed in paper I are stable\nup to the first maximum of the mass-radius curves, as one would expect. Although one will probably always\nbe forced to resort to numerical methods when one wants to model a real star, it would nevertheless be useful\nto have a simple exact solution that is not too unphysical. Such a solution would serve as a convenient tool\nfor investigating qualitative features and for testing numerical codes. In this context it could be useful to\nlist some criteria that an exact SSS solution should satisfy in order to be of astrophysical interest. In our\nhumble opinion, this list should minimally include\n\u2022 The centre should be regular (elementary flat), implying pressure isotropy there.\n\u2022 The energy density \u03c1 should be positive at the centre and everywhere non-negative.\n\u2022 The isotropic central pressure pc should be positive.\n\u2022 The surface of the model, where the radial pressure pr by necessity is zero, should be at a finite\nSchwarzschild radius r = R. Usually, although perhaps not necessarily, there are no other zeros of pr\nat smaller radii, implying that pr > 0 everywhere inside the surface of the star.\n\u2022 The three elastic wave modes associated with any propagation direction should have speeds v obeying\n0 \u2264 v 2 \u2264 1 in geometrical units. In other words the equation of state, at least in the range it is used,\nshould be microstable (v 2 \u2265 0) and causal (v 2 \u2264 1).\n\u2022 The model should be stable against radial perturbations.\nExact solutions with elastic matter sources have previously been constructed by Magli and Kijowski[5].\nThese solutions do not obey all of the first four criteria however, while to our knowledge it is undetermined\nwhether they obey the last two. On the other hand it should be stressed that a solution may fulfill the\ncriteria only when matched to some other matter region instead of used as a stellar model in its own right.\nIn this paper we will present a family of solutions having a branch on which all of the criteria are satisfied.\nThe contents and structure of the present paper are as follows;\nIn section 2 we introduce and discuss the properties of a particular equation of state, which we refer to\nas the stiff ultrarigid equation of state (SUREOS). The most important features of this equation of state are\nlisted below.\n\u2022 The SUREOS can be split into a conformally invariant part and a vacuum energy density B, leading\nto the relation \u03c1 = p1 + p2 + p3 + 4B for the energy density and principal pressures which in turn\nimplies that the spacetime Ricci scalar is constant and equal to 4\u03baB, with \u03ba = 8\u03c0 in geometrical units.\nIn this sense the SUREOS is similar to the MIT bag (perfect fluid) equation of state \u03c1 = 3p + 4B\ndescribing non-interacting strange quark matter in the limit of zero quark mass[6]. Furthermore, the\nenergy density and principal pressures are required to satisfy the inequality \u03c1 > p\u03bc + 2B for all \u03bc.\n\n2\n\n\f\u2022 The SUREOS is stiff in the sense that the speed of sound for longitudinal elastic waves propagating in\nprincipal directions is marginally causal, i.e. equal to the speed of light. In fact the SUREOS allows for\none purely longitudinal wave mode with marginally causal sound speed in any propagation direction.\nIn this sense the SUREOS is similar to the stiff perfect fluid equation of state \u03c1 = p + \u03c10 proposed by\nZel'dovich[7].\n\u2022 The SUREOS is ultrarigid in the sense that it has a very high shear modulus, of the same order as the\nenergy density. This results in very high propagation speeds for the remaining two elastic wave\n\u221a modes\nthat are purely transversal in principal directions. In an unsheared state these speeds are 1/ 2 times\nthe speed of light. In general they are always real, positive and strictly less than the speed of light.\nIn section 3 we give a recipe for obtaining stationary rigid motion solutions to the Einstein equations\nwith SUREOS elastic matter source. The recipe simply amounts to making the spacetime Ricci scalar take\na constant value to be identified with 4\u03baB and, in addition, to ensure that the inequalities \u03c1 > p\u03bc + 2B are\nsatisfied by the eigenvalues of the resulting stress-energy tensor. As soon as this has been achieved one has\nan exact solution to the Einstein equations with SUREOS elastic matter source, with respect to a material\nspace metric that can be explicitly constructed according to a simple algebraic formula. Clearly one can\ntake the view that this method of letting the solution determine the material space metric, rather than the\nother way around, is cheating. Indeed, should one want to specify the material space metric by e.g. taking\nit to be flat, then the method should be of little use since the resulting \"backwards\" constructed metric\nwill in general be curved. Although a flat metric is the correct choice when one wants to describe a solid\nregion without any lattice dislocations (cf. section 3 in paper I), such a desciption will only be appropriate\nthroughout a rather small solid region of e.g. a neutron star. In particular, a neutron star crust, having a\nthickness of the order 1 km, is bound to contain many dislocations. Unless one wants to go into a detailed\ndescription of the dislocations, their average effect over distances containing many of them can instead be\nconsidered to be encoded into an effective, generally curved, material space metric. In the case of neutron\nstar crusts this effective metric is in principle \"created\" at the moment when the outer region of a new\nborn neutron star cools down to the temperature at which solidification occurs, or at the moment when an\nolder/colder neutron star settles down after a star quake (rupture of the crust). Analogous remarks apply\nto solid cores in neutron stars, should such cores exist. When constructing an equilibrium stellar model,\nthe simplest choice of effective material space metric is the one that results (usually only implicitly) from\nassuming that the star is in an unsheared state, implying pressure isotropy so that the star can alternatively\nbe thought of as being made up out of perfect fluid matter. In this case the rigidity of the stellar matter only\nenters through a nonvanishing shear modulus when considering stellar perturbations around the equilibrium\nmodel. Whereas this approach is fine under many circumstances, it does not allow for studies of how the\nperturbations are affected by pressure anisotropies of the background. To test the effect of anisotropies one\ncan use moderately (and hence realistically) anisotropic equilibrium models, such as the ones constructed\nnumerically in paper I, or some exact solution which is likely to have more extreme pressure profiles, should\nit be possible to find one that obeys the basic list of criteria set up above. This paper goes to show that this\nindeed is possible.\nIn section 4 we apply the general recipe of section 3 to construct a spherically symmetric family of\nsolutions for which each member has constant energy density. As a direct consequence of the constant energy\ndensity and the equation of state, the radial and tangential pressure cannot be simultaneously decreasing\nwith increasing radius because of the linear relation \u03c1 = pr + 2pt + 4B. Instead it turns out that the\nradial pressure is monotonically decreasing from the centre to the surface while the tangential pressure is\nmonotonically increasing at half the rate. For each fixed value of the equation of state parameter B the\nsolution family has one remaining free parameter which can be chosen to be the (isotropic) central pressure,\ngoing between zero and infinity. For B = 0 the equation of state is scale invariant and the central pressure\nis just a trivial scaling parameter. However, for B > 0 (we see B < 0 as unphysical) the freely specifiable\ncentral pressure results in a nontrivial mass-radius curve, exhibiting a mass maximum. From the conclusions\ndrawn in paper II this maximum should be the point where instability sets in. More precisely, since the only\nmass extremum is for the maximum mass solution, the solutions with lower central pressure should be stable\nwhereas those with higher central pressure should have exactly one unstable mode of radial oscillations,\n3\n\n\fgiven that it is known that the models are stable in the limit of zero central pressure. This behaviour is\nexactly what a numerical determination of the first two frequencies of radial oscillations shows. The main\nmotivation for this paper is the fact that the solutions on the stable branch of the mass-radius curve satisfy\nall items on the above list of criteria for physicality of exact spherically symmetric solutions. Due to the\nrather extreme equation of state and the nature of the energy density and pressure profiles, we make no\nclaims that this solution family provides an accurate description of real stars. However, solid neutron star\ncores having very high shear moduli up to the same order of magnitude as the pressure have actually been\ndiscussed in the literature, especially in the first half of the 70s (cf. Haensel[8] for a discussion, historical\nnotes and further references). Should such cores exist, despite the fact that they have not been theoretically\nfavoured in later years, the SUREOS would be a very relevant toy model equation of state. Moreover, we\nwish to emphasize that in contrast to the interior Schwarzschild models which also have constant energy\ndensity, the elastic matter models presented here have causal speeds of wave propagation. The reason why\ncausality is compatible with constant energy density in the latter case is because the energy density consists\nof two parts; one purely compressional part which is outwards decreasing and one shearing part which is\noutwards increasing due to increase of pressure anisotropy. Clearly then, a constant energy density can be\nobtained if these two effects exactly cancel each other out, which is precisely what happens here.\nIn section 5 we present another spherically symmetric solution with B = 0 for which the energy density\nas well as the radial and tangential pressures all are outwards monotonically decreasing, which in that sense\nmakes it a more realistic model of a star. The solution turns out to be unstable, however, which should not\nbe too surprising considering that a B = 0 model with finite central pressure can be viewed as a rescaled\nversion of a B 6= 0 model with infinite central pressure. Because of its instability we do not discuss this\nsolution in great detail, but it should be interesting to generalise it to B > 0 since we then expect there to be\na stable branch of solutions anologous to the stable branch of the constant energy density family. The reason\nwhy there exists more than one one-parameter solution for a given equation of state and central pressure is\ndue to the freedom of choosing the material space metric in more than one way. Clearly it is this freedom\nthat makes the simple recipe for generating SUREOS solutions possible. Even more interesting would be to\nuse the recipe for finding rigidly rotating solutions, but that is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe notation and conventions will follow papers I and II.\n\n2\n\nThe stiff ultrarigid equation of state (SUREOS)\n\nAs shown in paper I, given an elastic equation of state of the general type associated with a material space\nmetric,\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(n1 , n2 , n3 ),\n(1)\nwhere the n\u03bc 's are the principal linear particle densities as defined in paper I, the speed of a longitudinal\nelastic wave propagating in the direction of a unit principal vector e\u03bca is given by\n2\nv\u03bc||\n=\n\n\u03b2\u03bc\n,\n\u03c1 + p\u03bc\n\n\u03b2\u03bc = n \u03bc\n\n\u2202p\u03bc\n.\n\u2202n\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\nUsing that the principal pressure p\u03bc is defined through the relation\n\u03c1 + p\u03bc = n\u03bc\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n,\n\u2202n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nwe can rewrite eq. (2) as\n\u22022\u03c1\n\u2202n\u03bc2\n=\n.\n\u2202\u03c1\nn\u03bc\n\u2202n\u03bc\nn\u03bc2\n\n2\nv\u03bc||\n\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\fSetting v\u03bc|| to a constant, say c|| , it follows that \u03c1 should satisfy the differential equation\nn\u03bc2\n\n\u22022\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n.\n= c||2 n\u03bc\n2\n\u2202n\u03bc\n\u2202n\u03bc\n\n(5)\n\nSince we are only considering elastic materials that are intrinsically isotropic, the equation of state (1) should\nbe invariant under permutations of the n\u03bc 's. With this restriction the general solution to eq. (5) is\n\u03c1 = C1 (n1 n2 n3 )\u03b1 + C2 [(n1 n2 )\u03b1 + (n2 n3 )\u03b1 + (n3 n1 )\u03b1 ] + C3 (n1\u03b1 + n2\u03b1 + n3\u03b1 ) + C4 ,\n\n\u03b1 = 1 + c||2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C1 - C4 are constants. In this paper we focus on a particular equation of state belonging to this\nclass, namely the one specified by setting \u03b1 = 2, C1 = C3 = 0 which we refer to as the stiff ultrarigid\nequation of state (SUREOS) for reasons explained in the introduction and below. Renaming the remaining\ntwo constants as C2 = A, C4 = B we find that the energy density and principal pressures for the SUREOS\nare\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(7)\n\u03c1 = A (n1 n2 )2 + (n2 n3 )2 + (n3 n1 )2 + B\n\u0003\n\u0002 2 2\n\u2202\u03c1\n2\np\u03bc = n\u03bc\n(8)\n\u2212 \u03c1 = A n\u03bc (n\u03bc+1 + n\u03bc+2\n) \u2212 (n\u03bc+1 n\u03bc+2 )2 \u2212 B,\n\u2202n\u03bc\n\nwhere we use the cyclic rule \u03bc + 3 = \u03bc. This leads to the linear relation\n\u03c1 = p1 + p2 + p3 + 4B.\n\n(9)\n\nIn an isotropic state, i.e. when n1 = n2 = n3 = n1/3 leading to p1 = p2 = p3 = p, this relation mimics\nthe MIT bag equation of state \u03c1 = 3p + 4B with B being the bag constant. This directly suggests that B\nshould be positive or at least non-negative, since B < 0 would lead to a negative energy\n\u221a density at zero\nisotropic pressure. Now, while the speed of sound for the MIT bag equation of state is 1/ 3 times the speed\nof light, the longitudinal speed of sound in principal directions for the SUREOS is by construction equal to\nthe speed of light since we have set \u03b1 = 2. With the longitudinal speed of sound being marginally causal\nin principal directions, it is natural to wonder if it may become acausal in other propagation directions. In\ngeneral, neither longitudinal nor transversal waves stay purely longitudinal/transversal when continuously\nvarying the propagation direction away from a principal direction, but the SUREOS in fact allows for a\npurely longitudinally polarized wave mode in all propagation directions. Moreover, the speed of these waves\nis direction independent and hence equal to the speed of light. These statements are proved in the appendix.\nWhat about the remaining two polarization modes? As opposed to the longitudinal mode their speeds\ngenerally depend on the polarization direction. In principal directions the modes are purely transversal with\nspeeds v\u03bc\u22a5\u03bd given by\n2\nv\u03bc\u22a5\u03bd\n= (\u03c1 + p\u03bd )\u22121\n\nn\u03c32\nn\u03bd2 (p\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bc )\n=\n,\nn\u03bd2 \u2212 n\u03bc2\nn\u03c32 + n\u03bc2\n\n\u03c3 distinct from \u03bc and \u03bd.\n\n(10)\n\nHere the indices \u03bc and \u03bd refer to two distinct principal unit vectors e\u03bca and e\u03bda , corresponding to the\npropagation and polarization direction, respectively. Clearly, these speeds are strictly within the range of\nmicrostability and causality, obeying\n2\n0 < v\u03bc\u22a5\u03bd\n< 1.\n(11)\nMoreover, we prove in the appendix that the speeds of these modes are less than the speed of light also in\ngeneric propagation directions.\nAlthough the SUREOS is neither of the quasi-Hookean type discussed in paper I, nor of the closely\nrelated type introduced by Carter and Quintana[9], we can still define an unsheared energy density \u03c1\u030c and\nshear modulus \u03bc\u030c that are functions of the particle density n = n1 n2 n3 only. This should in fact be possible\nfor any physically reasonable equation of state of the type (1). The procedure is simply to consider the\n\n5\n\n\fbehaviour of the equation of state for small shear, i.e. when all linear particle densities n\u03bc are close to the\nunsheared value n1/3 . To this end it turns out convenient to make the Misner type reparametrisation\nn1 = n1/3 e2x2\nn2 = n1/3 e\u2212x2 +\nn3 = n\n\n\u221a\n\n3 x1\n\n\u221a\n1/3 \u2212x2 \u2212 3 x1\n\ne\n\n(12)\n.\n\nConsider first the quasi-Hookean equation of state of paper I for which the energy density is given by\n\u03c1q.H. = \u03c1\u030c + \u03bc\u030cs2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u030c and \u03bc\u030c are functions of n whereas s2 is given by\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 #\n1\nn1\nn2\nn3\nn1\nn2\nn3\n2\ns =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n+\n12\nn2\nn1\nn3\nn2\nn1\nn3\ni\nh\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n=\nsinh2 ( 3 x1 \u2212 3x2 ) + sinh2 (2 3 x1 ) + sinh2 ( 3 x1 + 3x2 )\n3\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nInserting the reparametrisation (12) into the equation of state (7) instead gives\n\u03c1 = An4/3 [e\u22124x2 + e2(x2 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n3x1 )\n\n+ e2(x2 +\n\n\u221a\n3x1 )\n\n] + B.\n\n(16)\n\nAt fixed particle density n this expression for \u03c1 can be identified with a cyclic three-particle Toda lattice\npotential reduced to the centre of mass system (cf. [10]). It directly follows that the zero shear state\nx1 = x2 = 0 is the only state that extremizes \u03c1 (and hence also the energy per particle \u01eb = \u03c1/n) at fixed\nn. Moreover this extremum is a minimum if A is positive, which shall thus be assumed henceforth. Taylor\nexpanding the two energy densities (13) and (16) in x1 and x2 gives\n\u03c1q.H. = \u03c1\u030c + 6\u03bc\u030c(x12 + x22 ) + O(|x|4 )\n\u03c1 = 3An\n\n4/3\n\n+ B + 12An\n\n4/3\n\n(x12\n\n(17)\n+\n\nx22 )\n\n3\n\n+ O(|x| ).\n\n(18)\n\nHence we can identify the SUREOS as a quasi-Hookean equation of state up to second order in x1 and x2 ,\nwith unsheared energy density and shear modulus given by\n\u03c1\u030c = 3An4/3 + B\n\u03bc\u030c = 2An\n\n4/3\n\n.\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nClearly the shear modulus is very large, of the same order as the unsheared energy density unless B \u226b 3An4/3 .\nAs a consistency check, let us now use eqs. (19) and (20) to calculate the longitudinal and transversal wave\nspeeds v|| and v\u22a5 with respect to an isotropic background. To do so we first calculate the unsheared pressure\nand the bulk modulus:\nd\u03c1\u030c\n\u2212 \u03c1\u030c = An4/3 \u2212 B = 13 (\u03c1\u030c \u2212 4B)\ndn\ndp\u030c\n\u03b2\u030c = n\n= 43 An4/3 .\ndn\np\u030c = n\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nUsing the formulae of Carter[11] (rederived in paper I), we find that the isotropic wave speeds are\n\u03b2\u030c + 34 \u03bc\u030c\ndp\u030c 4 \u03bc\u030c\n=\n+\n=1\n\u03c1\u030c + p\u030c\nd\u03c1\u030c 3 \u03c1\u030c + p\u030c\n\u03bc\u030c\n1\nv\u22a52 =\n= .\n\u03c1\u030c + p\u030c\n2\nv||2 =\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThis is indeed consistent with our previous results, namely that the longitudinal wave speed is always equal\nto the speed of light while the principal transversal wave speeds are given by eq. (10).\n6\n\n\f3\n\nStationary solutions with rigid motion\n\nWe here restrict our attention to stationary spacetimes, i.e. spacetimes admitting a timelike Killing vector\nta . We also assume that the elastic matter source of Einstein's equations undergoes rigid motion, by which\nwe mean that the four-velocity ua is aligned with ta , i.e.\nua = f \u22121 ta ,\n\n(25)\n\nfor some scalar f . Since for elastic matter it always holds that\nha b uc Tbc = ha b uc (\u03c1 ub uc + pbc ) = 0,\n\nhab = ua ub + gab ,\n\n(26)\n\nit follows from Einstein's equations[12] that the twist of ta is locally the gradient of some scalar \u03c9,\n\u03c9a = \u2212\u01ebabcd tb \u2207c td = \u2207a \u03c9.\n\n(27)\n\nThe four-dimensional physical spacetime (M, gab ) is in this case completely determined by the three-dimensional structure (\u03a3, hab , f, \u03c9), where \u03a3 is the three-manifold of Killing orbits and where hab , f and \u03c9 are fixed\nfields on \u03a3. By \"fixed\" we mean that these fields are all anihilated by Lt , i.e. constant along the Killing\norbits. Letting Da denote the connection associated with hab , the Einstein equations with stress-energy\ntensor Tab = \u03c1ua ub + pab can be written in three-dimensional form as[12]\n\u03ba\u03c1 =\n\u03bapab =\n\n1 (3)\n3 \u22124 a\nD \u03c9 Da \u03c9\n2 R + 4f\n(3)\n\u22121\nGab + f [ (Dc Dc f )hab\n\n(28)\n\u2212 Da Db f ] +\n\n1 \u22124\n[ (Dc \u03c9Dc \u03c9)hab\n4f\n\n\u2212 2Da \u03c9Db \u03c9 ].\n\n(29)\n\nSince the energy density \u03c1 and the three principal pressures p\u03bc (the eigenvalues of pa b ) all are constant along\nthe Killing flowlines there will exist at least one functional relation,\nF (\u03c1, p1 , p2 , p3 ) = 0\n\n(30)\n\nfor any stationary spacetime of this type. It is not difficult to show that if the relation (30) can be written\nsuch that it is invariant under permutations of the p\u03bc 's, then the spacetime represented by hab , f and \u03c9 on\n\u03a3 can, under quite general circumstances, be interpreted as a rigid motion solution to the Einstein equation\nfor at least some elastic equation of state \u03c1 = \u03c1(n1 , n2 , n3 ) and an associated material space metric kAB .\nExplicitly, if the relation p\u03bc = n\u03bc \u2202\u03c1/\u2202n\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1 is inserted into eq. (30), the latter becomes a partial differential\nequation for the dependent variable \u03c1(n1 , n2 , n3 ). If the mentioned permutation symmetry holds there will\ngenerically exist1 , at least locally, a nonempty family of solutions \u03c1(n1 , n2 , n3 ) that are invariant under\npermutations of the n\u03bc 's and hence can be interpreted as elastic equations of state of the type we focus\non. Picking one member of the family, each linear particle density n\u03bc becomes an implicit function of three\nindependent combinations of \u03c1 and the p\u03bc 's, for instance by inverting the three relations p\u03bc = p\u03bc (n1 , n2 , n3 ).\nP3\nThis in turn determines the tensor kab = \u03bc=1 n\u03bc2 e\u03bc a e\u03bc b which by this construction trivially satisfies the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions ua kab = 0 and Lu kab = 0 for it to be the pullback of a material space\nthree-metric kAB from a three-manifold that can be identified with \u03a3. Since kAB should be positive definite,\none must finally require that n\u03bc2 > 0 for all \u03bc. It should be stressed that this method is in general of little\npractical use when it comes to finding exact solutions, since the equation of state and the material space\nmetric will only be implicitly defined and cannot, except in special cases, be expressed in closed analytic form.\nHowever, one such special case is provided by the SUREOS, i.e. by eq. (7), for which eq. (30) corresponds\nto the linear relation (9). That linear relation is identically satisfied for the SUREOS but in fact also for a\nwider class of equations of state that we do not discuss here. Taking thus the SUREOS to be the equation\nof state we can invert the relation (8) to find that the linear particle densities are given by\nn\u03bc4 =\n\n(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03bc+1 \u2212 2B)(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03bc+2 \u2212 2B)\n,\n2A(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03bc \u2212 2B)\n\n(31)\n\n1 We make no attempt to sort out under what precise conditions this will be true, since it is not our goal of this discussion.\nSuch an analysis would probably be nontrivial since eq. (30) can in principle be a complicated nonlinear function of its arguments.\n\n7\n\n\fwhere we have used eq. (9). Since \u03c1 \u2212 p\u03bc \u2212 2B are the eigenvalues of \u0398a b = (\u03c1 \u2212 2B)ha b \u2212 pa b , the inverted\nformulae (31) implies that kab can be calculated from the stress-energy tensor via \u0398a b according to\nkab =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n\b\nn\u03bc2 e\u03bc a e\u03bc b = [2A det(\u0398e f )]\u22121/2 \u0398c a \u0398bc \u2212 \u0398c c \u0398ab + 12 [(\u0398c c )2 \u2212 \u0398c d \u0398d c ]hab ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the last frame-invariant form, should it be cumbersome to diagonalize pab , is more useful than the\nrelation (31).\nThe linear relation (9) and Einstein's equations directly imply that the spacetime Ricci scalar R should\ntake the constant value 4\u03baB. Since we must have A > 0 for the equation of state to be physical, three\ninequalities are also imposed from\n\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03bc \u2212 2B = 2A(n\u03bc+1 n\u03bc+2 )2 > 0\n\nfor all \u03bc,\n\n(33)\n\nwhich is the same as saying that \u0398ab should be positive definite. All n\u03bc2 can subsequently be chosen to be\npositive, which is the last condition to be satisfied. Hence we have a very straightforward recipe for obtaining\nstationary rigid motion exact solutions to Einstein's equation with the SUREOS. We simply have to look\nfor stationary spacetimes described by hab , f and \u03c9 as above, for which the four-dimensional Ricci scalar\nR = (3)R \u2212 2f \u22121 Da Da f + 21 f \u22124 Da \u03c9Da \u03c9\n\n(34)\n\nis constant. This constant should then be identified with 4\u03baB and should hence be nonnegative if we want\nthe equation of state parameter B to be. If, in addition, \u0398ab is positive definite, we have a solution with\nrespect to the material space metric (32). The condition R = 4\u03baB may clearly be written as\nDa Da f = [ 21 (3)R \u2212 2\u03baB]f + 41 f \u22123 Da \u03c9Da \u03c9.\n\n(35)\n\nIt would be very interesting to try to find twisting solutions, especially axisymmetric solutions that could\ndescribe rotating stellar models. However, we shall here focus on the simpler static case, Da \u03c9 = 0, for which\neq. (35) is linear and homogeneous in f . In this case eq. (35) is obviously particularly simple when the\nspatial Ricci scalar (3)R is constant, which according to eq. (28) corresponds to setting the energy density\n\u03c1 constant. Morever, since (3)R and \u03c1 have the same sign we should have (3)R > 0 in order to obtain a\nphysically reasonable solution. The simplest case to consider is then to take hab to be locally isometric to\nthe metric of a three-sphere of some radius r0 , giving (3)R = 2\u03ba\u03c1 = 6/r02 . Choosing coordinates such that\nhab takes the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(36)\ndl2 = r02 dx2 + sin2 x (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 )\nand expanding f according to\n\nf=\n\n\u221e\nl\n1 X X\nclm Fl (x) Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\nsin x\n\n(37)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nwe obtain the radial equation\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd2\nl(l + 1)\n2\n+ k Fl = 0,\n\u2212 2+\ndx\nsin2 x\n\n(38)\n\nk 2 = 2(1 \u2212 \u03bar02 B)\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\nWhether the expansion (37) is appropriate to make depends on whether or not the resulting solution can\nbe matched to an exterior asymptotically flat vacuum solution, or perhaps to some other matter solution\nof interest. This will be a nontrivial task to analyse, except for the spherically symmetric case; clm = 0 for\nl > 0, which we focus on in section 4.\n\n8\n\n\f3.1\n\nConformally rescaled formulation\n\nWhen dealing with a four-dimensional stationary metric it is often useful to work with the variables \u03a8 = f 2\n(minus the norm of the Killing vector ta ), \u03c9 and the conformally rescaled spatial metric h\u0303ab = \u03a8hab , rather\nthan f , \u03c9 and hab . Making this reformulation here, we find that eq. (35) transforms into the equation\nD\u0303a D\u0303a \u03a8 =\n\n3D\u0303a \u03a8 D\u0303a \u03a8 \u2212 D\u0303a \u03c9 D\u0303a \u03c9\n\u2212 R\u0303 \u03a8 + 4\u03baB,\n2\u03a8\n\n(40)\n\nwhich is completely written in terms of the metric h\u0303ab ; D\u0303a is its connection, R\u0303 its Ricci scalar and indices are\nraised with its inverse, i.e. with h\u0303\u22121 ab = \u03a8\u22121 hab . Note that \u03a8 and \u03c9 correspond to the real and imaginary\npart, respectively, of the Ernst potential E = \u03a8 + i\u03c9 which in vacuum satisfies the equation\nD\u0303a D\u0303a E =\n\nD\u0303a E D\u0303a E\n.\nRe E\n\n(41)\n\nWe expect eq. (40) to be a useful complement to eq. (35), especially when looking for solutions that can be\nmatched to exterior vacuum solutions, the latter being completely determined by giving the Ernst potential\nE in the important case of axisymmetry. Again, a more detailed investigation of these matters is postponed\nfor future work.\n\n4\n\nExact SSS solutions with constant energy density\n\nIn the spherically symmetric case, the ansatz that the spatial metric hab be a three-sphere metric implies\nthat the spacetime metric can be written as\nds2 =\n\n\u0012\n\nF\nsin x\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndt2 + r02 dx2 + sin2 x (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) ,\n\nr02 =\n\n2 \u2212 k2\n,\n2\u03baB\n\n(42)\n\nwhere F should satisfy eq.

Here we will briefly present a different SUREOS solution which\nis more realistic in the sense that the energy density as well as both principal pressures are monotonically\noutwards decreasing, just to illustrate that such solutions do exist. The solution was found for B = 0 only\nand although we have made some attempts to generalise it to nonzero B we have not been able to do so.\nIn Schwarzschild coordinates the spacetime metric for the solution has the simple analytic form\nds2 = sinc\u22122 (r/r0 ) (\u2212\u03b12 dt2 + dr2 ) + r2 d\u03a92 ,\n\nsinc x =\n\nsin x\n.\nx\n\n(73)\n\nTo match the solution to a Schwarzschild exterior without rescaling the time coordinate, the constant \u03b1\nshould be chosen as\n\u03b1 = sinc2 (R/r0 ),\n(74)\nwhere R is the radius of the star, i.e. r = R is the surface of vanishing radial pressure, to be determined\nbelow. Regularity at the centre is clearly guaranteed by the fact that sinc x = 1 at x = 0. The energy\ndensity and principal pressures are given by\n\u03bar2 \u03c1 = 1 + sinc2 (r/r0 ) \u2212 2 sinc(r/r0 ) cos(r/r0 )\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03bar pr = \u22121 + 3 sinc (r/r0 ) \u2212 2 sinc(r/r0 ) cos(r/r0 )\n2m\n\u03bar2 pt =\n= 1 \u2212 sinc2 (r/r0 )\nr\n\n(75)\n(76)\n(77)\n(78)\n\n\u03c1c = 3pc =\n\n1\n.\n\u03bar02\n\n(79)\n\nThe profiles of these quantities are plotted in figure 6. The radial pressure drops to zero very close to r = 2r0 ,\nor more precisely\nR \u2248 1.9979 r0,\n(80)\nimplying \u03b1 \u2248 0.2075 and R/M \u2248 2.5237.\nA similar analysis to that of section 4.1 reveals that the fundamental radial mode is unstable with squared\nfrequency \u03c902 \u2248 \u22120.07017 r0\u22122 which for a typical neutron star with a radius of the order of 10 km corresponds\nto an e-folding time of about 0.4 ms. Clearly then, this solution is not very interesting on its own right, but\nif it could be generalised to a family with B being a free parameter we expect there to be a stable branch of\nsolutions.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion and outlook\n\nExact solutions to the Einstein equations can very rarely be used to completely replace numerically obtained\nsolutions, with a few important exceptions such as the Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions. The\nreason is of course that it is almost always impossible to find an exact solution that obeys all restrictions that\nare imposed by requiring that the solution be astrophysically realistic. However, if an exact solution satisfies\nat least some basic criteria for physicality, that solution has the potential of being a useful tool for gaining\nqualitative insights. Furthermore it can be very useful as a test background model when doing numerical\nstudies of various types of perturbations. The constant energy density family of exact SSS solutions with\nstiff ultrarigid equation of state does, in our opinion, satisfy the relevant list of basic criteria that renders\nit useful in these respects. In fact we have already used it in the present paper to test that our analysis\nand numerical codes for radial oscillations of spherically symmetric elastic matter models are behaving as\n17\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c1 / pc\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\np /p\nt\n\nc\n\np /p\nr\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nc\n\n0.2\n\nr x p1/2\nc\n\nFigure 6: Energy density and pressure profiles for the B = 0 solution with outwards\ndecreasing energy density and eigenpressures.\nexpected; Clearly it cannot be a coincidence that we find the zeroth mode turning unstable for the maximum\nmass member of the family, to numerical precision. So far this had only been tested for the numerically\nintegrated models presented in paper I, which all have moderate pressure anisotropies, but now we know\nthat it also works as expected for models with more extreme anisotropies.\nSince the presented method of generating SUREOS solutions does not rely upon spherical symmetry\nbut only on stationarity and rigid motion, it would be very nice if one could also apply it to finding a\nrigidly rotating solution family. Although the equation of state is rather extreme, it is nevertheless always\nmicrostable and causal and hence, in our view, more physical than the equation of state \u03c1 + 3p = \u03c10 for\nWahlquist's rotating perfect fluid solution[16]. The latter equation of state fails to be microstable since the\nsquared speed of sound dp/d\u03c1 is obviously negative.\n\nAppendix\nSince the principal longitudinal speed is equal to the speed of light, it is of interest to find out whether\nthis speed can become superluminal when the propagation vector \u03bd a is perturbed around the principal unit\nvector e\u03bca . For the SUREOS the Fresnel tensor can be written in the simple form\nQab = \u03c1hab + pab \u2212 Lab ,\n\n(81)\n\nwhere Lab is the tensor\nLab =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03c3=1\n\n(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03c3 \u2212 2B)Z\u03c3a Z\u03c3b = 2A\n\n3\nX\n\n2\n2\nn\u03c3+1\nn\u03c3+2\nZ\u03c3a Z\u03c3b ,\n\n\u03c3=1\n\n18\n\na\na\nZ\u03c3a = \u01ebabc e\u03c3b \u03bdc = \u03bd\u03c3+1 e\u03c3+2\n\u2212 \u03bd\u03c3+2 e\u03c3+1\n. (82)\n\n\fP3\nThus the characteristic equation, which given a unit propagation vector \u03bd a = \u03c3=1 \u03bd\u03c3 e\u03c3a determines three\npropagation speeds v and polarization vectors \u03b9a , can in this case be rewritten in the convenient form\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(83)\n(1 \u2212 v 2 )(\u03c1hab + pab ) + Lab \u03b9b = 0.\n\nSince all three vectors Z\u03c3a are orthogonal to \u03bd a , so is the tensor Lab which means that the characteristic\nequation always has the solution\nv2 = 1\n\n(84)\n\n\u03b9a = \u03bda\n\n(85)\n\nSince this result holds regardless of the choice of propagation vector \u03bd a , we have proved the claim that\nthe equation of state allows for a purely longitudinally polarized wave mode in all directions, i.e. not only\nprincipal directions which is the case generically. Moreover, the speed of these waves is direction independent\nand equal to the speed of light. Let us now consider Lab as a tensor on the two-space orthogonal to \u03bd a (and,\nof course, to ua ). As such, its determinant (or, rather, the determinant of the mixed tensor La b ) can be\ncalculated according to\n1 ab cd\n\u01ebab = \u01ebabc \u03bd c .\n(86)\n2 L L \u01ebac \u01ebbd ,\nThe result is\n1 ab cd\n2 L L \u01ebac \u01ebbd\n\n=\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03c3=1\n\n(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03c3+1 \u2212 2B)(\u03c1 \u2212 p\u03c3+2 \u2212 2B)\u03bd\u03c32 = 4A2 n2\n\n3\nX\n\nn\u03c32 \u03bd\u03c32 .\n\n(87)\n\n\u03c3=1\n\nClearly, this scalar can only be zero if at least one linear particle density vanishes which only happens if the\nmaterial space mapping is degenerate which is disallowed. Now, with Lab being orthogonal to \u03bd a and of rank\ntwo, it follows that the only solution to the characteristic equation (83) with v 2 = 1 is the longitudinally\npolarized solution. For, if \u03b9a was to have a nonvanishing projection orthogonal to \u03bd a , that projection would\nhave to be annihilated by Lab which is impossible by the nondegeneracy property of the latter. As a corollary\nwe thus have proved that the remaining two polarization modes always have propagation speeds less than\nunity. This follows from the facts that they should vary continuously with the propagation direction and\nthat they are strictly less than unity for propagation in principal directions, in which case the polarization\nis purely transversal.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
