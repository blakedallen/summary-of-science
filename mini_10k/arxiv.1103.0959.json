We classify all finite\nEI categories with hereditary category algebras, characterizing them\nas free EI categories (in a sense which we define) for which all endomorphism groups of objects have invertible orders. Some applications\non the representation types of finite EI categories are derived.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we study the representations of finite EI categories. They\nare small categories with finitely many morphisms in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism. This concept includes many structures such as\nfinite groups, finite posets and free categories associated to finite quivers. A\nrepresentation of C is a covariant functor from C to the category of finite\ndimensional vector spaces, and it may be regarded as the same thing as a\nfinitely generated module for the category algebra.\nWe introduce the concepts of finite EI quivers and finite free EI categories.\nA finite EI quiver is a quiver equipped with two maps f and g. The map f\nassigns a finite group f (v) = Gv to each vertex v in the quiver and the map\ng assigns a (Gw , Gv )-biset to each arrow from the vertex v to the vertex w in\nthe quiver. Finite free EI categories are categories generated from finite EI\nquivers by a specific rule which generalizes the construction of a free category\nfrom a quiver [4]. We will show that they are characterized by a certain\nunique factorization property of the non-isomorphisms. In a certain sense a\n1\n\n\f2\nfinite free EI category is the largest EI category which can be generated by\na finite EI quiver.\nFor every finite EI category C, we will construct a finite free EI category\n\u02c6\nC and a full functor F\u0302 : C\u02c6 \u2192 C such that F\u0302 is the identity map restricted\nto objects, endomorphisms and all non-isomorphisms which can not be expressed as composites of more than one non-isomorphism. This category C\u02c6\nis unique up to isomorphism. We call C\u02c6 the free EI cover of C.\nA finite EI category C determines a finite dimensional associative kalgebra kC with identity, called the category algebra (defined in section 2).\nUnder the assumption that the endomorphism groups of all objects in C have\norders invertible in k, we will describe an explicit algorithm to construct the\nordinary quiver of the category algebra kC. This algorithm uses the representations of semisimple group algebras and their restrictions to subgroups. It\nis easier and more intuitive than the method by computing Exts, introduced\nin [6]. Our main results are described in the following theorems:\nTheorem 1.1. Let C be a finite EI category for which the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects have orders invertible in the field k. Then the quiver Q\nconstructed by our algorithm is precisely the ordinary quiver of the category\n\u02c6 the\nalgebra kC. Moreover, kC has the same ordinary quiver as that of k C,\n\u02c6\ncategory algebra of the free EI cover C of C.\nTheorem 1.2. Let C be a finite EI category. Then the category algebra kC is\nhereditary if and only if C is a finite free EI category satisfying the condition\nthat the endomorphism groups of all objects have orders invertible in k.\nThese results are useful in determining the representation types of category algebras. Indeed, if C is a finite free EI category for which the endomorphism groups of all objects have orders invertible in k, then it has the\nsame representation type as that of its ordinary quiver. Stated explicitly, kC\nis of finite (tame, resp.) representation type if and only if the underlying\ngraph of its ordinary quiver is a disjoint union of Dynkin (Euclidean, resp.)\ndiagrams. Otherwise, it is of wild type. For a general finite EI category C,\n\u02c6 the category algebra of its free EI cover C.\n\u02c6\nkC is a quotient algebra of k C,\nThus the finite representation type of k C\u02c6 implies the finite representation\ntype of kC, no matter what the characteristic of k is. Moreover, if C has a\nfull subcategory of infinite representation type, it is of infinite representation\ntype as well. By studying those full subcategories which are finite free EI\ncategories, for example the connected full subcategories with two objects, we\ncan get certain information about the representation types of general finite\nEI categories.\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n3\n\nHere is the layout of this paper: in section 2 we give some background on\nthe representation theory of finite EI categories, and introduce the definitions\nof finite EI quivers and finite free EI categories. An equivalent definition by\nthe unique factorization property of non-isomorphisms is proved, and we\npresent some further basic properties.\nFrom section 3 onwards we focus on the representations of finite EI categories for which all endomorphism groups of objects have orders invertible\nin k. In section 4 we give a detailed algorithm to construct an associated\nquiver Q for each finite EI category for which the endomorphism groups of\nall objects have orders invertible in the field k. Then we prove Theorem 1.1.\nIn section 5 we prove Theorem 1.2, which classifies all finite EI categories\nwith hereditary category algebras.\nEven though we can study the representation type of C by constructing its\nordinary quiver, it is more efficient sometimes to use certain simple criteria\ndeduced from Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. In the last section we describe\nsuch criteria expressed in terms of full subcategories with two objects.\nIt is sometimes useful to know an explicit functor F from kC-mod, the\ncategory of all representations of a finite free EI category C, to kQ-mod, the\ncategory of all representations of the ordinary quiver Q of kC. Although our\nproof of Theorem 1.2 does not rely on this functor, we describe it in detail\nin the appendix. This functor is proved to be full, faithful and dense, and\nhence induces a Morita-equivalence between kC and kQ.\nIn this paper C is always a finite EI category with objects Ob(C) and\nmorphisms Mor(C). We use AutC (x) (or EndC (x)) to denote the endomorphism group of a fixed object x in C and HomC (x, y) to denote the set of\nmorphisms from an object x to another object y. The field k is supposed\nto be algebraically closed. All modules are finitely generated left modules.\nComposition of group actions, morphisms and maps is from right to left.\nAcknowledgement: The author wants to express great appreciation to\nhis advisor, Professor Peter Webb, who led the author into this area. Without\nhis invaluable suggestions and help this paper would not have appeared.\nProfessor Webb also contributed the concepts of finite EI quivers and finite\nfree EI categories for this paper. These ideas are described in his unpublished\nnotes.\n\n2\n\nFinite Free EI Categories\n\nFor the reader's convenience, we include in this section some background on\nthe representation theory of finite EI categories. Please refer to [7], [9], [10]\nfor more details.\n\n\f4\nThe category algebra kC of a finite EI category C is the k-space with\nbasis the morphisms in C. Its product \u2217 is determined by bilinearity from\nthe product of the basis elements, given by the rule:\n\u03b1\u2217\u03b2 =\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2 if \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be composed\n0 otherwise.\n\nLet R be representation of C defined in section 1. Then it assigns a vector\nspace R(x) to each object x in C, and a linear transformation R(\u03b1) : R(x) \u2192\nR(y) to each morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y such that all composition relations of\nmorphisms in C are preserved under R. Notice that R(x) has a kEndC (x)module structure for every object x in C. Indeed, for each morphism g in\nEndC (x), R(g) is an automorphism of R(x). Thus we can define an action\nof g on R(x) by letting g * v = R(g)(v), for all v in R(x). A homomorphism\n\u03c6 : R1 \u2192 R2 of two representations is a natural transformation of functors.\nBy Theorem 7.1 of [5], a representation of C is equivalent to a kC-module.\nThus we don't distinguish these two concepts throughout this paper.\nA finite EI category C is said to be of finite (tame, wild, resp.) representation type if the category algebra kC is of finite (tame, wild, resp.) type.\nThe category C is connected if for any two distinct objects x and y, there\nis a list of objects x = x0 , x1 , . . . , xn = y such that either HomC (xi , xi+1 ) or\nHomC (xi+1 , xi ) is not empty, 0 6 i 6 n \u2212 1. Every finite EI category is a\ndisjoint unionF\nof connected components, and each component is a full subcategory. If C = m\ni=1 Ci , the category algebra kC has an algebra decomposition\nkC1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 kCm . Moreover, if C and D are equivalent finite EI categories,\nkC-mod is equivalent to kD-mod by Proposition 2.2 in [7]. Thus it is sufficient to study the representations of connected, skeletal finite EI categories.\nWe make the following convention:\nConvention: All finite EI categories in this paper are connected and skeletal. Thus endomorphisms, isomorphisms and automorphisms coincide.\nUnder the hypothesis that C is skeletal, if x and y are two distinct objects\nin C with HomC (x, y) non-empty, then HomC (y, x) is empty. Indeed, if this is\nnot true, we can take \u03b1 \u2208 HomC (y, x) and \u03b2 \u2208 HomC (x, y). The composite \u03b2\u03b1\nis an endomorphism of y, hence an automorphism. Similarly, the composite\n\u03b1\u03b2 is an automorphism of x. Thus both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are isomorphisms, so x is\nisomorphic to y. But this is impossible since C is skeletal and x 6= y.\nIt is time to introduce the concept of finite free EI categories. Before\ngiving a formal definition, we define finite EI quivers, which are finite quivers\nwith extra structure.\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n5\n\nDefinition 2.1. A finite EI quiver Q\u0302 is a datum (Q0 , Q1 , s, t, f, g), where:\n(Q0 , Q1 , s, t) is a finite acyclic quiver with vertex set Q0 , arrow set Q1 , source\nmap s and target map t. The map f assigns a finite group f (v) to each vertex\nv \u2208 Q0 ; the map g assigns an (f (t(\u03b1)), f (s(\u03b1)))-biset to each arrow \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 .\nIf f assigns the trivial group to each vertex in Q0 in the above definition,\nwe obtain a quiver in the usual sense. In this sense, finite acyclic quivers are\nspecial cases of finite EI quivers.\nEach finite EI quiver Q\u0302 = (Q0 , Q1 , s, t, f, g) determines a finite EI category CQ\u0302 in the following way: the objects in CQ\u0302 are precisely the vertices in\nQ0 . For a particular object v in CQ\u0302 , we define EndCQ\u0302 (v) = f (v), which is a\nfinite group by our definition. It remains to define HomCQ\u0302 (v, w) if v 6= w are\ndistinct vertices in Q0 , and the composition of morphisms.\n\u03b3\nLet v /o /o /o / w be a directed path from v to w. Then \u03b3 can be written\nuniquely as a composition of arrows, where vi \u2208 Q0 and \u03b1i \u2208 Q1 for i =\n1, . . . , n.\nv = v0 \u03b11 / v1 \u03b12 / . . . \u03b1n / vn = w\nNotice that g(\u03b1i ) is an (f (vi ), f (vi\u22121 ))-biset, so we define:\nH\u03b3 = g(\u03b1n ) \u00d7f (vn\u22121 ) g(\u03b1n\u22121) \u00d7f (vn\u22122 ) . . . \u00d7f (v1 ) g(\u03b11 ),\ntheFbiset product defined in [8]. Finally, HomCQ\u0302 (f (v), f (w)) can be defined\nas \u03b3 H\u03b3 , the disjoint union of all H\u03b3 , over all possible paths \u03b3 from x to y.\nIn the case v = w we define HomCQ\u0302 (v, v) = f (v).\nLet \u03b1 and \u03b2 be two morphisms in CQ\u0302 . They lie in two sets H\u03b31 and H\u03b32 ,\nwhere \u03b31 and \u03b32 are two paths determined by \u03b1 and \u03b2 respectively, possibly\nof length 0. Their composite \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 can be defined by the following rule: it is\n0 if the composite \u03b32 \u03b31 is not defined in Q\u0302. Otherwise, the initial vertex v\nof \u03b32 is exactly the terminal vertex of \u03b31 . Since there is a natural surjective\nmap p : H\u03b32 \u00d7 H\u03b31 \u2192 H\u03b32 \u00d7f (v) H\u03b31 , we define \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 = p(\u03b2, \u03b1), the image of\n(\u03b2, \u03b1) in H\u03b32 \u00d7f (v) H\u03b31 . This definition satisfies the associative rule, and in\nthis way we get a finite EI category CQ\u0302 from Q\u0302.\nDefinition 2.2. A finite EI category C is a finite free EI category if it is\nisomorphic to the finite EI category CQ\u0302 generated from a finite EI quiver Q\u0302\nby the above construction.\nIn practice it is inconvenient to check whether a finite EI category C is\nfree or not by using the definition. Fortunately, there is an equivalent characterization built upon unfactorizable morphisms: the Unique Factorization\nProperty (UFP).\n\n\f6\nDefinition 2.3. A morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 z in C is unfactorizable if \u03b1 is\nnot an isomorphism and whenever it has a factorization as a composite\n\u03b2\n/ y \u03b3 / z , then either \u03b2 or \u03b3 is an isomorphism.\nx\nThe reader may want to know the relation between the terminology unfactorizable morphism and the term irreducible morphism which is widely\naccepted and used, for example in [2] and [9]. Indeed, in this paper they\ncoincide since we only deal with finite EI categories. But in a more general\ncontext, they are different, as we explain in the following example:\nExample 2.4. Consider the following category C with two objects x \u2247 y.\nThe non-identity morphisms in C are generated by \u03b1 : x \u2192 y and \u03b2 : y \u2192 x\nwith the only nontrivial relation being \u03b2\u03b1 = 1x . Then the morphisms in C are\n1x , 1y , \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b2. It is not a finite EI category since \u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 EndC (y) is not an\nisomorphism. Then neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 are irreducible morphisms since one of\nthem is a split monomorphism and the other is a split epimorphism. However,\nthe reader can check that they are unfactorizable morphisms. Furthermore,\nthe algorithm constructing ordinary quivers of this category algebra (described\nin section 4) still works well. This example illustrates the reason that we\nintroduce the notion unfactorizable morphisms: our algorithm works in a\nmore general situation where unfactorizable morphisms do not coincide with\nirreducible morphisms any more.\n\u03b1\n1x\n\n9\n\nxj\n\u03b2\n\n*\n\nye\n\n1y\n\nNote that the composite of an unfactorizable morphism with an isomorphism is still unfactorizable.\nProposition 2.5. Let \u03b1 : x \u2192 y be an unfactorizable morphism. Then h\u03b1g\nis also unfactorizable for every h \u2208 AutC (y) and every g \u2208 AutC (x).\nProof. Fix a decomposition h\u03b1g = \u03b11 \u03b12 . Then we have \u03b1 = (h\u22121 \u03b11 )(\u03b12 g \u22121 ).\nBut \u03b1 is unfactorizable, so by definition either one of h\u22121 \u03b11 and \u03b12 g \u22121 is an\nisomorphism. Without loss of generality, let h\u22121 \u03b11 be an isomorphism. Then\n\u03b11 is an isomorphism since h\u22121 is an automorphism.\nLet C be a finite EI category. By the previous proposition, the set of unfactorizable morphisms from an object x to another object y is closed under\nthe actions of AutC (x) and AutC (y). Choose a fixed representative for each\n(AutC (y),AutC (x))-orbit. Repeating this process for all pairs of different objects (x, y), we get a set A = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n } of orbit representatives. Elements\nin A are called representative unfactorizable morphisms.\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n7\n\nWe should point out here that each finite EI category C determines a finite\nEI quiver Q\u0302 in the following way: its vertices are objects in C; we put an\narrow x :\u2192 y in Q\u0302 for each representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y\nin C. Thus the arrows biject with all representative unfactorizable morphisms\n\u03b1 : x \u2192 y in C, or equivalently, all AutC (y) \u00d7AutC (x)-orbits of unfactorizable\nmorphisms in C. The map f assigns EndC (x) to each object x; the map g\nassigns the (AutC (y), AutC (x))-biset where a representative unfactorizable\nmorphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y lies to the corresponding arrow. Obviously, this finite\nEI quiver is unique up to isomorphism. We call this quiver the finite EI\nquiver of C.\nNow suppose that C is a finite free EI category. It is possible that there\nis more than one finite EI quiver generating C, although they must have the\nsame vertices. However, it is not hard to see that all those finite EI quivers\nare subquivers of the finite EI quiver of C.\nAll non-isomorphisms can be written as composites of unfactorizable morphisms.\nProposition 2.6. Let \u03b1 : x \u2192 y be a morphism with x 6= y. Then it\nhas a decomposition x = x0 \u03b11 / x1 \u03b12 / . . . \u03b1n / xn = y , where all \u03b1i are\nunfactorizable.\nProof. If \u03b1 is unfactorizable, we are done. Otherwise, \u03b1 has a decomposition\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nx 1 / x1 2 / y where neither \u03b11 nor \u03b12 is an isomorphism. In particular,\nx1 is different from x and y. If both \u03b11 and \u03b12 are unfactorizable, we are\ndone. Otherwise, assume \u03b11 is not unfactorizable. Repeating the above process, we can get a decomposition x \u03b111 / x11 \u03b112 / x1 \u03b12 / y . With the same\nreasoning, x, x11 , x1 , y are pairwise different. Since there are only finitely\nmany objects, this process ends after finitely many steps. Therefore we get\na decomposition of \u03b1 into unfactorizable morphisms.\nFor an arbitrary finite EI category C, the ways to decompose a nonisomorphism into unfactorizable morphisms need not to be unique. However,\nwe can show that for finite free EI categories, this decomposition is unique\nup to a trivial relation, i.e., they satisfy the property defined below:\nDefinition 2.7. A finite EI category C satisfies the Unique Factorization\nProperty (UFP) if whenever any non-isomorphism \u03b1 has two decompositions\ninto unfactorizable morphisms:\nx = x0\n\n\u03b11\n\nx = x0\n\n\u03b21\n\n/\n\n/\n\nx1\n\n\u03b12\n\ny1\n\n\u03b22\n\n/\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u03b1m\n\n...\n\n\u03b2n\n\nxm = y\n/\n\n/\n\nyn = y\n\n\f8\nthen m = n, xi = yi , and there are hi \u2208 AutC (xi ), 1 6 i 6 n \u2212 1 such that\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b21 = h1 \u03b11 , \u03b22 = h2 \u03b12 h\u22121\n1 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 = hn\u22121 \u03b1n\u22121 hn\u22122 , \u03b2n = \u03b1n hn\u22121 .\nThe UFP gives a characterization of finite free EI categories.\nProposition 2.8. A finite EI category C is free if and only if it satisfies the\nUFP.\nProof. Suppose C is a finite free EI category generated by a finite EI quiver\nQ\u0302 = (Q0 , Q1 , s, t, f, g). Let \u03b1 : v \u2192 w be an arbitrary non-isomorphism. By\nthe previous proposition \u03b1 can be written as a composite of unfactorizable\nmorphisms. Let \u03b1m \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b11 and \u03b2n \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b21 be two such decompositions\nof \u03b1. It is easy to see from definitions that an unfactorizable morphism in C\nlies in g(\u03c4 ) for some unique arrow \u03c4 \u2208 Q1 . Thus \u03b1m \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b11 and \u03b2n \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b21\ndetermine two F\npaths \u03b31 and \u03b32 in Q\u0302 from v to w. But \u03b1 is contained in\nHomC (v, w) = \u03b3 H\u03b3 , the disjoint union taken over all possible paths from\nv to w, so \u03b31 must be the same as \u03b32 . Consequently, m = n, and \u03b1i and \u03b2i\nhave the same target and source for 1 6 i 6 n. By the definition of biset\nproduct, the fact\n\u03b1n \u25e6 (\u03b1n\u22121 . . . \u25e6 \u03b11 ) = \u03b2n \u25e6 (\u03b2n\u22121 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b21 )\nin the biset product implies that there is an automorphisms gn\u22121 \u2208 AutC (xn\u22121 )\nsuch that\n\u03b1n = \u03b2n gn\u22121 ,\n\n\u22121\n(\u03b1n\u22121 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b11 ) = gn\u22121\n(\u03b2n\u22121 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b21 ),\n\nwhere xn\u22121 is the common target of \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b2n\u22121 . By an easy induction\non n, we show that {\u03b1i }ni=1 and {\u03b2j }nj=1 have the required relations in the\nprevious definition. Thus C satisfies the UFP.\nOn the other hand, if C satisfies the UFP, we want to show that C is\nisomorphic to the finite free EI category CQ\u0302 generated from its finite EI quiver\nQ\u0302. Define a functor F : C \u2192 CQ\u0302 in the following way: First, F (x) = x for\nevery object x in C since Ob(C) = Ob(CQ\u0302 ) by our construction. Furthermore,\nit is also clear that AutC (x) = AutCQ\u0302 (x) for every object x, and the biset of\nunfactorizable morphisms from x to y in C is the same as that in CQ\u0302 for every\npair of different objects x and y. Therefore we can let F be the identity map\nrestricted to automorphisms and unfactorizable morphisms in C. Proposition\n2.6 tells us that every non-isomorphism \u03b1 in C is a composite \u03b1n \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b11\nof unfactorizable morphisms, so F (\u03b1) can be defined as F (\u03b1n ) \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 F (\u03b11 ).\nBy the UFP F is well-defined and is a bijection restricted to HomC (x, y) for\neach pair of distinct objects x and y. Consequently, F is a bijection from\nMor(C) to Mor(CQ\u0302 ) and so is an isomorphism. This finishes the proof.\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n9\n\nFinite free EI categories have a certain universal property which is stated\nin the following proposition:\nProposition 2.9. Let C be a finite EI category. Then there is a finite free\nEI category C\u02c6 and a full functor F\u0302 : C\u02c6 \u2192 C such that F\u0302 is the identity map\nrestricted to objects, isomorphisms and unfactorizable morphisms. This finite\nfree EI category is unique up to isomorphism.\nWe call C\u02c6 the free EI cover of C.\nProof. We mentioned before that every finite EI category C determines a\nfinite EI quiver Q\u0302 (see the paragraphs before Proposition 2.6), hence a finite\nfree EI category CQ\u0302 satisfying: Ob(C) = Ob(CQ\u0302 ); AutC (x) = AutCQ\u0302 (x) for\nevery object x; the biset of unfactorizable morphisms from x to y in C is the\nsame as that in CQ\u0302 for every pair of different objects x and y.\nDefine a functor F\u0302 : CQ\u0302 \u2192 C in the following way: F is the identity\nmap on objects, isomorphisms and unfactorizable morphisms. Now if \u03b4 :\nx \u2192 y is neither an isomorphism nor an unfactorizable morphism, it can be\ndecomposed as the composite\nx = x0\n\n\u03b21\n\nx1\n/\n\n\u03b22\n\n...\n/\n\n\u03b2m\n\nxm = y,\n\n/\n\nwhere each \u03b2i is unfactorizable for 1 6 i 6 m. Define\nF\u0302 (\u03b4) = F\u0302 (\u03b2m ) . . . F\u0302 (\u03b22 )F\u0302 (\u03b21 ).\nF\u0302 is clearly well defined for all isomorphisms and unfactorizable morphisms. We want to verify that F\u0302 is well defined for factorizable morphisms\nas well. That is, if \u03b4 has another decomposition into unfactorizable morphisms\nx = x0\n\n\u03b21\u2032\n\n/\n\nz1\n\n\u03b22\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u2032\n\u03b2n\n\n/\n\nzn = y,\n\nthen\nF\u0302 (\u03b2n )F\u0302 (\u03b2n\u22121 ) . . . F\u0302 (\u03b21 ) = F\u0302 (\u03b2n\u2032 ) . . . F\u0302 (\u03b22\u2032 )F\u0302 (\u03b21\u2032 ).\nSince C satisfies the UFP, we have m = n and xi = zi for 1 6 i 6 n, and\n\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u22121\n\u03b21 = h1 \u03b21\u2032 , \u03b22 = h2 \u03b22\u2032 h\u22121\n1 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 = hn\u22121 \u03b2n\u22121 hn\u22122 , \u03b2n = \u03b2n hn\u22121 , where\nhi \u2208 AutC (xi ). Thus:\nF\u0302 (\u03b2n )F\u0302 (\u03b2n\u22121 ) . . . F\u0302 (\u03b21 )\n\u2032\n\u22121\n\u2032\n= F\u0302 (\u03b2n\u2032 h\u22121\nn\u22121 )F\u0302 (hn\u22121 \u03b2n\u22121 hn\u22122 ) . . .

It is full since all automorphisms\nand unfactorizable morphisms in C are images of F\u0302 , and all other morphisms\nin C are their composites. Moreover, C\u02c6 is unique up to isomorphism since it\nis completely determined by objects, isomorphisms and unfactorizable morphisms in C.\nIt is well-known that every subgroup of a free group is still free. Finite\nfree EI categories have a similar property.\nProposition 2.10. Let C be a finite EI category. Then C is a finite free EI\ncategory if and only if all of its full subcategories are finite free EI categories.\nProof. The if part is trivial since C is such a subcategory of itself. Now let\nD be a full subcategory of C. We want to show that D satisfies the UFP.\nTake a factorizable morphism \u03b1 in D and two decompositions of the\nfollowing form:\nx = x0\n\n\u03b11\n\nx = x0\n\n\u03b21\n\n/\n\n/\n\nx1\n\n\u03b12\n\nx\u20321\n\n\u03b22\n\n/\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u03b1m /\n\n...\n\n\u03b2n\n\nxm = y\nx\u2032n = y\n/\n\nwhere all \u03b1i and \u03b2j are unfactorizable in D, but possibly factorizable in C.\nDecomposing them into unfactorizable morphisms in C, we get two extended\nsequences of unfactorizable morphisms as follows:\nx = x0\n\n\u03b41\n\nx = x0\n\n\u03b81\n\n/\n\n/\n\nw1\n\n\u03b42\n\nw1\n\n\u03b82\n\n/\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u03b4r\n\n...\n\n\u03b8r\n\nwr = y\n/\n\n/\n\nwr = y\n\nEach pair of morphisms \u03b4i and \u03b8i have the same source and target since C is a\nfinite free EI category. Moreover, there are hi \u2208 AutC (wi ), 1 6 i 6 r \u22121, such\n\u22121\n\u22121\nthat \u03b81 = h1 \u03b41 , \u03b82 = h2 \u03b42 h\u22121\n1 , . . ., \u03b8r\u22121 = hr\u22121 \u03b4r\u22121 hr\u22122 , \u03b8r = hr\u22121 \u03b4r . If we\ncan prove the fact that m = n and x1 = x\u20321 , . . ., xm = x\u2032n , then the conclusion\nfollows. Indeed, if this is true, say x1 = x\u20321 = wr1 , . . ., xm = x\u2032m = wrm , then\n\u22121\nwe have \u03b21 = hr1 \u03b11 , \u03b22 = hr2 \u03b12 h\u22121\nr1 , . . ., \u03b2n = \u03b1n hrn , which is exactly the\nUFP.\nWe show this fact by contradiction. Suppose that x1 = x\u20321 , x2 = x\u20322 , . . .,\nxi\u22121 = x\u2032i\u22121 , and let xi be the first object in the sequence different from x\u2032i .\nNotice both xm . . . x1 and x\u2032n . . . x\u20321 are subsequences of the sequence wr . . . w1 .\nAs a result, xi appears before x\u2032i in wr . . . w1 , or after x\u2032i . Without loss of\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n11\n\ngenerality we assume that xi is before x\u2032i . Let xi\u22121 = x\u2032i\u22121 = wa , xi = wb and\nx\u2032i = wc . We must have a \u2264 b < c. Furthermore, we check that\n\u03b2i = \u03b8c \u25e6 \u03b8c\u22121 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b8a+1 = (\u03b8c \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b8b+1 ) \u25e6 (\u03b8b \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b8a+1 ),\nwith (\u03b8c \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b8b+1 ) contained in HomC (xi , x\u2032i ) and (\u03b8b \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b8a+1 ) contained\nin HomC (xi\u22121 , xi ). But D is a full subcategory, so \u03b2i is the composite of two\nnon-isomorphisms in D. This is a contradiction since we have assumed that\n\u03b2i is unfactorizable in D.\nThe condition that D is a full subcategory of C is required. Consider the\nfollowing two examples:\nExample 2.11. Let C be the free category generated by the following quiver.\nLet D be the subcategory of C obtained by removing the morphism \u03b2 from C.\nThe category C is free, but the subcategory D is not free. Indeed, morphisms\n\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b2, \u03b3 are all unfactorizable in D. Thus the morphism \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 has two\ndecompositions (\u03b3\u03b2) \u25e6 \u03b1 and (\u03b3) \u25e6 (\u03b2\u03b1), which contradicts the UFP.\n\u2022\n\n\u03b1\n\n/\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2022\n\n/\u2022\n\n\u03b3\n\n/\n\n\u2022\n\nExample 2.12.

Then \u03b21 \u03b1 = (\u03b22 g)\u03b1 =\n\u03b22 (g\u03b1) = \u03b22 \u03b1. It is not hard to check that C satisfies the UFP; but the\nsubcategory formed by removing the morphism g from C doesn't satisfies the\nUFP.\n\n1x\n\n\u03b1\n\n/\n\nhgi\n\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\n/\n/\n\n1z\n\nProposition 2.13.

Since the functor F\u0302 : C\u02c6 \u2192 C is bijective on objects, by Proposition\n2.2.3 in [10], it induces an algebra homomorphism from k C\u02c6 to kC by sending\n\u02c6 to F\u0302 (\u03b1) \u2208 Mor(C). This homomorphisms is surjective since F\u0302 is\n\u03b1 \u2208 Mor(C)\nfull.\nWe want to clarify some confusion probably caused by the name \"finite\nfree EI categories\": a finite free EI category C is in general not a free category\nas the following example shows.\n\n\f12\nExample 2.14. Let C be a category with one object whose morphisms form\na non-identity group. Then C is a finite free EI category by our definition.\nBut it is not a free category since the morphism group is not a free monoid.\n\n3\n\nRepresentations of Free EI Categories\n\nIn this section we study the representations of finite free EI categories. First,\nlet us introduce some notation.\nA representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y uniquely determines\na subcategory D\u03b1 of C: Ob(D\u03b1 ) = {x, y}, AutD\u03b1 (x) = AutC (x), AutD\u03b1 (y) =\nAutC (y), HomD\u03b1 (x, y) is the whole (AutC (y), AutC (x))-orbit where \u03b1 lies.\nObviously, D\u03b1 is a finite free EI category.\nWith the above setup, we can show that a representation of a finite free\nEI category C is determined by its local structures on subcategories D\u03b1 for\nall representative unfactorizable morphisms \u03b1. Stated formally, it is:\nProposition 3.1. Let C be a finite free EI category, and R be a rule assigning a kAutC (x)-module to each object x and a linear transformation to each\nunfactorizable morphism in C. If R restricted to D\u03b1 is a representation of\nD\u03b1 for every representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 in C, then R induces\na unique representation R\u0303 of C such that R\u0303 restricted to each D\u03b1 is the same\nas R restricted to D\u03b1 .\nProof. Since we can define R\u0303(x) = R(x) for each object x in C, it suffices to\ndefine a linear map for each morphism in C such that the composition relations are preserved. If \u03b2 is an automorphism or an unfactorizable morphism,\nit must belong to some subcategory D\u03b1 for a representative unfactorizable\nmorphism \u03b1. Because R restricted to D\u03b1 is a representation, we then define\nR\u0303(\u03b2) = R(\u03b2).\nNow suppose that \u03b2 is factorizable and decompose it into unfactorizable\nmorphisms of the following form\nx = x0\n\n\u03b11\n\n/ x1\n\n\u03b12\n\n...\n/\n\n\u03b1m /\n\nxm = y .\n\nLet R\u0303(\u03b1) = R(\u03b1m ) . . . R(\u03b11 ). We claim that it is well defined. That is: if \u03b1\nhas two different decompositions\nx = x0\n\n\u03b11\n\nx = x0\n\n\u03b21\n\n/\n\nx1\n\n\u03b12\n\ny1\n\n\u03b22\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u03b1m\n\n...\n\n\u03b2n\n\n/\n\nxm = y\n\nand\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\nyn = y ,\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n13\n\nthen it is true that R(\u03b1m ) . . . R(\u03b11 ) = R(\u03b2n ) . . . R(\u03b21 ).\nIndeed, because C satisfies the unique factorization property, we have\n\u22121\nm = n, xi = yi , and \u03b21 = h1 \u03b11 , \u03b22 = h2 \u03b12 h\u22121\n1 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 = hn\u22121 \u03b1n\u22121 hn\u22122 ,\n\u03b2n = \u03b1n h\u22121\nn\u22121 for some hi \u2208 EndC (xi ), 1 6 i 6 n \u2212 1. Notice that each \u03b1i and\nthe corresponding \u03b2i are unfactorizable, and lie in D\u03b1i since \u03b2i and \u03b1i are in\nthe same orbit. The fact that R restricted to D\u03b1i is a representation of this\n\u22121\nsubcategory implies R(hi )R(h\u22121\ni ) = R(hi hi ) = 1. Thus:\nR\u0303(\u03b2n ) . . .

R(\u03b11 )\n= R\u0303(\u03b1n . . . \u03b11 ).\nWe proved that R\u0303 is indeed a representation of C. Moreover, R\u0303 restricted\nto any D\u03b1 is exactly the same as R restricted to this subcategory. The\nuniqueness is obvious since from the above process we conclude that R\u0303 is\nuniquely determined by its values on subcategories D\u03b1 , for all representative\nunfactorizable morphisms \u03b1 in C.\nProposition 3.2. Let C be a finite free EI category. Let R1 and R2 be two\nrepresentations of C. Then a family of kAutC (x)-module homomorphisms\n{\u03c6x : R1 (x) \u2192 R2 (x) | x \u2208 Ob(C)} is a kC-module homomorphism from R1 to\nR2 if and only if for each representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y,\nwe have \u03c6y R1 (\u03b1) = R2 (\u03b1)\u03c6x .\nProof. The only if part is trivial. For the other direction, let us consider\nunfactorizable morphisms first. If \u03b2 : x \u2192 y is unfactorizable, it lies in\nthe same orbit as a unique representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1, i.e.,\n\u03b2 = h\u03b1g, where g \u2208 AutC (x) and h \u2208 AutC (y). Because \u03c6x is a kAutC (x)module homomorphism, and \u03c6y is a kAutC (y)-module homomorphism, we\nhave:\n\u03c6y R1 (h\u03b1g) = \u03c6y R1 (h)R1 (\u03b1)R1 (g)\n= R2 (h)\u03c6y R1 (\u03b1)R1 (g)\n= R2 (h)R2 (\u03b1)\u03c6x R1 (g)\n= R2 (h)R2 (\u03b1)R2 (g)\u03c6x\n= R2 (h\u03b1g)\u03c6x .\nThat is, \u03c6y R1 (\u03b2) = R2 (\u03b2)\u03c6x .\n\n\f14\nIf \u03b2 is factorizable, let x = x0 \u03b11 / x1 \u03b12 / . . . \u03b1m / xm = y be a decomposition of \u03b2 into unfactorizable morphisms. Consider the following diagram:\nR1 (x0 )\n\nR1 (\u03b11 )\n\n/\n\nR1 (\u03b12 )\n\nR1 (x1 )\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u000f\n\nR2 (x0 )\n\n/\n\n...\n\nR1 (\u03b1m )\n\n...\n\nR2 (\u03b1m )\n\n/\n\nR1 (xm )\n\u03c6m\n\n\u03c61\nR2 (\u03b11 )\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nR2 (\u03b12 )\n\nR2 (x1 )\n\n/\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nR2 (xm ).\n\nFor i = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1, we have \u03c6i+1 R1 (\u03b1i+1 ) = R2 (\u03b1i+1 )\u03c6i . Thus:\n\u03c6m R1 (\u03b2)\n= \u03c6m R1 (\u03b1m )R1 (\u03b1m\u22121 ) . . . R1 (\u03b11 )\n= R2 (\u03b1m )\u03c6m\u22121 R1 (\u03b1m\u22121 ) . . . R1 (\u03b11 )\n...\n= R2 (\u03b1m )R2 (\u03b1m\u22121 ) . . . R2 (\u03b11 )\u03c60\n= R2 (\u03b2)\u03c60 .\nThis finishes the proof.\nThroughout the remaining of this section we use the following notation:\n\u03b1 : x \u2192 y is a fixed representative unfactorizable morphism and D\u03b1 is the\ncorresponding subcategory of C (see our notation before Proposition 3.1 for\nthe definition of D\u03b1 ). Let G and H be AutC (x) and AutC (y) respectively.\nDefine: G0 = StabG (\u03b1), H0 = StabH (\u03b1), G1 = StabG (H\u03b1), and H1 =\nStabH (\u03b1G). Obviously G1 = {g \u2208 G : exists h \u2208 H with \u03b1g = h\u03b1}, and\nH1 = {h \u2208 H : exists g \u2208 G with h\u03b1 = \u03b1g}. The group G (H, resp.) acts\ntransitively on HomD\u03b1 (x, y) if and only if H1 = H (G1 = G, resp.), bearing\nin mind that HomD\u03b1 (x, y) only has one orbit as a biset.\nLemma 3.3. With the above notation, G0 and G1 are subgroups of G, H0 and\nH1 are subgroups of H. Moreover, G0 \u22b3 G1 , H0 \u22b3 H1 , and G1 /G0 \u223c\n= H1 /H0 .\nProof. This result is well-known to Bouc who described the structures of\nbisets in [3]. We give an elementary proof here. It is routine to check that\nG0 6 G, G1 6 G by definition. Similarly, H0 6 H and H1 6 H. It is also\nclear that G0 6 G1 and H0 6 H1 .\nLet g0 \u2208 G0 , g \u2208 G1 and consider g \u22121g0 g. Since g \u2208 G1 , there is h \u2208 H\nsuch that \u03b1g = h\u03b1. Then \u03b1g \u22121g0 g = h\u22121 \u03b1g0 g = h\u22121 \u03b1g = h\u22121 h\u03b1 = \u03b1. This\nmeans g \u22121 g0 g \u2208 G0 and G0 \u22b3 G1 . Similarly, H0 \u22b3 H1 .\nNow define a map \u03c6 : G1 7\u2192 H1 /H0 by the following rule: for every\ng \u2208 G1 , there is some h \u2208 H such that \u03b1g = h\u03b1. By the definition h is\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n15\n\ncontained in H1 . Define \u03c6(g) = h\u0304, the image of h in H1 /H0 . The reader\ncan check that \u03c6 is well defined, surjective, and a group homomorphism.\nMoreover, the kernel of this map is exactly G0 . Thus G1 /G0 \u223c\n= H1 /H0 .\nRemark 3.4. Under the isomorphism given in this lemma, we identify the\n1\u223c\nquotient group G1 /G0 with H1 /H0 , and the module k \u2191G\nG0 = k(G1 /G0 ) with\n1\u223c\nk \u2191H\nH0 = k(H1 /H0 ).\nFrom now on we insist:\nConvention: All finite EI categories C we study satisfy that the endomorphism group of every object x in C has order invertible in k.\nA representation R of D\u03b1 determines a linear map \u03c6 = R(\u03b1) from a kGmodule R(x) to a kH-module R(y). Notice that both R(x) and R(y) are\nsemisimple by Maschke's theorem in view of the previous convention.\nLemma 3.5. Let U be a simple summand of R(x) \u2193G\nG1 . If \u03c6(U) 6= 0, then:\nG1\n(1) U is a direct summand of k \u2191G0 ;\n(2) the restricted map \u03c6U : U \u2192 \u03c6(U) is a k(G1 /G0 )-module isomorphism\nH1\n1\u223c\nunder the identification k \u2191G\nG0 = k \u2191 H0 ;\n1\n(3) \u03c6(U) is a direct summand of k \u2191H\nH0 .\nProof. If \u03c6(U) 6= 0, there is some u \u2208 V1 \u2286 U such that \u03c6(u) = w 6=\n1\n0, where V1 is a simple summand of U \u2193G\nG0 . We claim that each g \u2208 G0\nfixes u, hence V1 \u223c\n= k. Indeed, if there is g \u2208 G0 such that gu 6= u, then\n\u03c6(u \u2212 gu) = \u03c6(u) \u2212 (\u03c6g)(u) = 0 since g \u2208 G0 fixes \u03c6. But u \u2212 gu 6= 0\nis also in V1 and generates the simple kG0 -module V1 , too. Now the fact\nthat G0 fixes \u03c6 and \u03c6(u \u2212 gu) = 0 implies that V1 is sent to 0 by \u03c6. In\n1\nparticular u is sent to 0. This is a contradiction. Thus V1 \u223c\n= k | U \u2193G\nG0 . But\nG1\nG1\nHomkG1 (k \u2191G\n, U) \u223c\n= HomkG0 (k, U \u2193G\nG0 ) 6= 0, so U | k \u2191G0 . This proves the\n0\nfirst statement.\nTake any g \u2208 G1 and let \u1e21 be its image in G1 /G0 under the natural\n1\nprojection. Since U | k \u2191G\nG0 , we know gu = \u1e21u for every u \u2208 U. With the\nidentification G1 /G0 \u223c\n= H1 /H0 , \u1e21 is identified with a certain h\u0304 \u2208 H1 /H0 ,\nwhere h \u2208 H1 acts on \u03c6(U) in the same way as h\u0304 acts on it. But h\u03b1 = \u03b1g \u2208\nHomD\u03b1 (x, y) and R is a representation of D\u03b1 , so we should have \u03c6(gu) =\nh\u03c6(u), that is: \u03c6(\u1e21u) = h\u0304\u03c6(u). Consequently, \u03c6 is a k(G1 /G0 )-module\nhomomorphism if we identify \u1e21 and h\u0304. Since U is simple, and \u03c6 is nonzero,\nit must be an isomorphism. This is the second statement.\nOn the other hand, every h \u2208 H0 acts trivially on \u03c6(u) = w since h fixes \u03c6.\nThus the kH0 -module generated by w is isomorphic to the trivial kH0 -module\n\n\f16\nH1\nH1\n1\n\u223c\nk, so k | \u03c6(U) \u2193H\nH0 . Again, HomkH1 (k \u2191H0 , \u03c6(U)) = HomkH0 (k, \u03c6(U) \u2193H0 ) 6=\n1\n0, so \u03c6(U) and k \u2191H\nH0 have a common simple summand. By (2), \u03c6(U) as\nthe nontrivial homomorphic image of a simple module must be simple, too.\n1\nThus \u03c6(U) | k \u2191H\nH0 .\n\nThe conclusions in the previous lemma actually characterize linear maps\nR(\u03b1), where R is a representation of D\u03b1 .\nLemma 3.6. let \u03c6 : M \u2192 N be a linear map from a kG-module M to a kHmodule N such that for every simple summand U of M \u2193G\nG1 , the restricted\nG1\nmap \u03c6U : U \u2192 \u03c6(U) is zero when U \u2224 k \u2191G0 , and a k(G1 /G0 )-module\nhomomorphism otherwise. Then \u03c6 determines a representation R of D\u03b1 with\nR(x) = M, R(y) = N and R(\u03b1) = \u03c6.\nProof. We define a functor R : D\u03b1 \u2192 k-Vec by letting R(x) = M, R(y) =\nN. If \u03b2 is an automorphism of x or y, R(\u03b2) is already defined since M\nis a kAutD\u03b1 (x)-module and N is a kAutD\u03b1 (y)-module. Otherwise \u03b2 in\nHomD\u03b1 (x, y) can be written as h\u03b1g, where h \u2208 H, g \u2208 G, \u03b1 is the representative unfactorizable morphism determining D\u03b1 . In this case R(\u03b2) can\nbe defined as h\u03c6g. The conclusion follows after we show that this definition\nis well-defined. That is, if h1 \u03b1g1 = h2 \u03b1g2 , then h1 \u03c6g1 = h2 \u03c6g2 .\nSince M as a vector space is the direct sum of all the summands of M \u2193G\nG1 ,\nit is enough to show that for every summand U, and each u \u2208 U, we have\n\u22121\nh1 \u03c6g1 (u) = h2 \u03c6g2 (u), or equivalently: h\u22121\n2 h1 \u03c6(u) = \u03c6(g2 g1 u). The fact that\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nh1 \u03b1g1 = h2 \u03b1g2 implies h\u22121\n2 h1 \u03b1 = \u03b1g2 g1 , hence h2 h1 \u2208 H1 and g2 g1 \u2208 G1 ,\nso g2 g1\u22121 u \u2208 U and \u03c6(g2 g1\u22121 u) = \u03c6U (g2 g1\u22121u). Thus it is sufficient to prove\n\u22121\nthat h\u22121\n2 h1 \u03c6U (u) = \u03c6U (g2 g1 u).\n\u22121\nIf \u03c6U = 0, we have \u03c6U (g2 g1\u22121u) = 0 = h\u22121\n2 h1 0 = h2 h1 \u03c6U (u) trivially.\nOtherwise, let h\u0304 be the projection of h\u22121\n2 h1 into H1 /H0 , and \u1e21 be the projection of g2\u22121 g1 into G1 /G0 . Then g2\u22121 g1 u = \u1e21u, and h\u22121\n2 h1 \u03c6U (u) = h\u0304\u03c6U (u)\nG1\nH1\nbecause U | k \u2191G0 and \u03c6(U) | k \u2191H0 . Since \u1e21 is sent to h\u0304 by the isomorphism\nG1 /G0 \u223c\n= H1 /H0 , and \u03c6U is a k(G1 /G0 )-module homomorphism, we have:\n\u22121\nh\u22121\nh\n\u03c6\n1 U (u) = h\u0304\u03c6U (u) = \u03c6U (\u1e21u) = \u03c6U (g2 g1 u). Thus R is well defined, and\n2\nthe conclusion follows.\nRemark 3.7. Let \u03c6 : M \u2192 N be a linear map from a kG-module M to a kHH\nmodule N. Let U (T , resp.) be a simple summand of M \u2193G\nG1 (N \u2193H1 , resp.).\nTake a fixed decomposition N = T \u2295 N \u2032 of vector space and let p : N \u2192 T\nbe the projection. Then \u03c6 is a direct sum of \u03c6U T s of the following form:\n\u03c6U T : U \u001f\n\n\u007f\n/\n\nM\n\n\u03c6\n\n/\n\nN\n\np\n\n//\n\nT\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n17\n\nLemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.6 tell us that \u03c6 is given by or gives a representation\nR of D\u03b1 if and only if the following is true: whenever \u03c6U T 6= 0, then U |\nH1\n1\nk \u2191G\nG0 , T | k \u2191H0 , and \u03c6U T is a k(G1 /G0 )-module isomorphism under the\ngiven identification.\n\n4\n\nOrdinary Quivers of Finite EI Categories\n\nIn this section we will construct the ordinary quiver Q for every finite EI\ncategory C under the hypothesis that the endomorphism groups of all objects\nin C have orders invertible in k. The algorithm used here to construct Q is\nexpressed in terms of the simple modules of endomorphism groups of objects\nin C and their restrictions to subgroups. This is easier and more intuitive\nthan the usual approach which uses the primitive idempotents and the radical\nof kC. Let us first introduce some preliminary results.\nLet G be a finite group whose order is invertible in k and G1 6 G be\na subgroup. For every kG-module M, we denote the homogeneous space of\na simple kG-module V in M by M(V ), that is, the sum of all submodules\nof M isomorphic to V . If U is a simple summand of V \u2193G\nG1 , we denote the\nhomogeneous space of U in M(V ) \u2193G\nby\nM(V,\nU).\nSince\nV\n\u2193G\nG1\nG1 may contain\nmore than one simple summand isomorphic to U, we choose a particular\ndecomposition and index different isomorphic copies of U in V \u2193G\nG1 by natural\nnumbers s \u2208 N. That is:\nV \u2193G\nG1 =\n\nt\nM\n\nUs \u2295 V \u2032 ,\n\ns=1\n\nwhere each Us is isomorphic to U and V \u2032 has no summands isomorphic to U.\nNow let M(V, U, s) be the sum of the s-th isomorphic copy of U in each\nG\nV \u2193G\nG1 of M(V ) \u2193G1 , s > 1. Thus if\nM(V ) = V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Vm\nis any decomposition of M(V ) and \u03b8i : V \u2192 Vi is a kG-module isomorphism,\nand\n\u2032\nV \u2193G\nG1 = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Ut \u2295 V\nis some fixed decomposition where Us \u223c\n= U for all 1 6 s 6 t and V \u2032 has no\nsummands isomorphic to U as kG1 -modules, then M(V, U, s) is defined as\n\u03b81 (Us ) \u2295 \u03b82 (Us ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03b8m (Us ). This definition of M(V, U, s) is dependent on\nthe fixed decomposition of V \u2193G\nG1 , but independent of the decomposition of\n\n\f18\nM(V ) up to an automorphism of M(V ), or equivalently, independent of the\nparticular isomorphisms \u03b8i . Indeed, if\nM(V ) = V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Vm\nand\nM(V ) = W1 \u2295 W2 . . . \u2295 Wn\nare two decompositions of M(V ). Then we get two lists of isomorphisms\nn\n{\u03b8i }m\ni=1 and {\u03c8j }j=1 with \u03b8i (V ) = Vi and \u03c8j (V ) = Wj . By the Krull-Schmidt\nTheorem, we have m = n, and there is a permutation \u03c0 of {1, . . . , n} together\nwith a family of kG-module isomorphisms \u03c6i : Vi \u223c\n= W\u03c0(i) . Since both \u03c8i and\n\u03c6i \u03b8i are isomorphisms from the simple kG-module V to the simple kG-module\nWi , we know that \u03c8i is a scalar multiple of \u03c6i \u03b8i by Schur's lemma. Thus\n\u03c81 (Us ) \u2295 \u03c82 (Us ) . . . \u2295 \u03c8m (Us )\n= \u03c61 (\u03b81 (Us )) \u2295 \u03c62 (\u03b82 (Us )) \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03c6m (\u03b8m (Us ))\n= \u03c6(\u03b81 (Us ) \u2295 \u03b82 (Us ) \u2295 . . . \u2295 \u03b8m (Us ))\nwhere \u03c6 is the direct sum of \u03c6i , an automorphism of M(V ). Thus the automorphism \u03c6 sends the space M(V, U, s) determined by the first decomposition\nof M(V ) to the space M(V, U, s) determined by the second decomposition of\nM(V ).\nRepeating the above process for all simple summands V of M, and all\nsimple summands U of V \u2193G\nG1 , we can decompose M as the direct sum of all\nsubspaces of the form M(V, U, s). That is:\nM M M\nM=\nM(V, U, s).\nV |M U |V \u2193G\nG\n\n1\n\ns\u2208Z\n\nNotice that for each fixed V and U, there are only finitely many s such that\nM(V, U, s) 6= 0. Thus this decomposition is well-defined. Let pV,U,s : M \u2192\nM(V, U, s) be the projection.\nLemma 4.1. With the above setup, every kG-module homomorphism \u03c6 :\nM1 \u2192 M2 as a linear map is the direct sum of all \u03c6V,U,s .\n\u03c6V,U,s : M1 (V, U, s) \u001f\n\n\u007f\n/\n\nM1\n\n\u03c6\n\n/\n\nM2\n\npV,U,s\n\n//\n\nM2 (V, U, s)\n\nProof. Since M1 as a vector space is the direct sum of all subspaces of the\nform M1 (V, U, s), it suffices to show that every subspace M1 (V, U, s) is sent\nby \u03c6 into M2 (V, U, s). First, since \u03c6 is a module homomorphism, and both\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n19\n\nM1 and M2 are semisimple, then the homogeneous space M1 (V ) \u2286 M1 is\nsent into the homogeneous space M2 (V ) \u2286 M2 . If either M1 (V ) or M2 (V )\nis 0, i.e., either M1 or M2 has no summand isomorphic to V , the conclusion\nholds trivially. Otherwise, take a particular simple summand V1 of M1 (V ),\nand a particular simple summand V2 of M2 (V ). The induced kG-module\nhomomorphism from V1 to V2 by \u03c6 is a scalar multiplication, hence sends the\ns-th isomorphic copy of U in V1 \u2193G\nG1 into the s-th isomorphic copy of U in\nG\nV2 \u2193G1 . Consequently, M1 (V, U, s) is sent into M2 (V, U, s).\nNow we construct the ordinary quiver Q for a finite EI category C. The\ndetailed algorithm is as follows:\nF\nStep 1: The vertex set of Q is x\u2208Ob(C) Sx , where Sx is a set of representatives of the isomorphism classes of simple kAutC (x)-modules.\nStep 2: Let \u03b1 : x \u2192 y be a representative unfactorizable morphism. Then\nit determines uniquely:\n\u2022 G = AutC (x), G0 = StabG (\u03b1), G1 = StabG (H\u03b1);\n\u2022 H = AutC (y), H0 = StabH (\u03b1), H1 = StabH (\u03b1G);\n\u2022 {V1 , . . . , Vm }: the set of pairwise non-isomorphic simple kG-modules;\n\u2022 {W1 , . . . , Wn }: the set of pairwise non-isomorphic simple kH-modules;\n1\n\u2022 {U1 , . . . , Ur }: the set of pairwise non-isomorphic simple summands of k \u2191G\nG0 .\nStep 3: For each particular simple kG-module V in {V1 , . . . , Vm } choose a\ner\n\u223c e1\ndecomposition V \u2193G\nG1 = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Ur \u2295 X where X has no summand isomorphic to any Ui . For each simple kH-module W in {W1 , . . . , Wn } choose\n\u223c f1\na decomposition W \u2193H\nUrfr \u2295 Y such that Y has no summand\nH1 = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295P\nisomorphic to any Ui . Then we put ri=1 ei fi arrows from the vertex V to\nthe vertex W in Q.\nStep 4: Repeat Steps 2-4 for all representative unfactorizable morphisms.\nRemark 4.2. We can index an arrow in Q by a list (\u03b1, V, W, U, s, l): this\narrow is induced by a representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y;\nit starts from a simple kAutC (x)-module V and ends at a simple kAutC (y)module W . This arrow is associated with the s-th isomorphic copy of U in\nH\nV \u2193G\nG1 and the l-th isomorphic copy of U in W \u2193H1 , where U is a comG1\nH\nmon summand of V \u2193G\nG1 , W \u2193H1 and k \u2191G0 under the given identification\n(G1 /G0 ) \u223c\n= (H1 /H0 ). See Lemma 3.3, Lemma 3.5 and Lemma 3.6 for more\ndetails.\n\n\f20\nAlthough the subspaces M(V, U, s) of M and N(W, U, l) of N depend on\nthe particular decomposition, the quiver we constructed by the above algorithm\nis independent of it. Indeed, we have:\nei = dimk HomG1 (Ui , V \u2193G\nG1 )\nand\nfi = dimk HomH1 (Ui , V \u2193H\nH1 )\nsince Ui can be viewed as both a kG1 -module and a kH1 -module by identifying\nG1 /G0 with H1 /H0 . Clearly ei and fi are invariant with respect to different\ndecompositions.\nThe following two simple examples illustrate our construction.\nExample 4.3. Let C be the following finite EI category where: G and L\nare cyclic groups of order 2 and 3 respectively; H and K are the symmetric\ngroups on 3 letters; O1 is an (H, G)-biset with two morphisms generated by\n\u03b1, fixed by the trivial subgroup of G and the proper subgroup of order 3 in H;\nO2 is a (K, H)-biset of 6 morphisms generated by \u03b2, permuted regularly by\nH and K; O3 is a (L, H)-biset with one morphism \u03b4, fixed by both H and L.\nG\n\nO1\n\n/\n\nH\n\nO2\n\n/\n\nK\n\nO3\n\n\u000f\n\nL\nThe reader may check that C is in fact a finite free EI category. We\nhave: kG \u223c\n= k \u2295 S, the direct sum of two non-isomorphic one dimensional\nmodules; kH \u223c\n= k \u2295 \u01eb \u2295 V2 \u2295 V2 , the direct sum of the trivial module k,\n= kK \u223c\nthe sign representation \u01eb, and two isomorphic copies of 2-dimensional simple\nmodules; kL \u223c\n= k \u2295 \u03c9 \u2295 \u03c9 2 , the direct sum of three pairwise non-isomorphic\none dimensional modules. Thus the associated quiver Q has 11 vertices.\nTo distinguish different vertices, we mark vertices corresponding to kGmodules with \u22c6, vertices corresponding to kH-modules with \u22c4, vertices corresponding to kK-modules with \u25e6, and vertices corresponding to kL-modules\nwith \u2022. Now we want to put arrows among them. It is not hard to see that\nC has 3 representative unfactorizable morphisms \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4.\nFirst, let us analyze \u03b1, which determines arrows from vertices marked\nby \u22c6 to vertices marked by \u22c4. Obviously, G0 = 1, G1 = G; H0 = C3 E H,\nH1 = H; and G1 /G0 \u223c\n= C2 . Thus \u03b1 gives rise to no arrow ending at\n= H1 /H0 \u223c\nthe vertex \u22c4V2 since it is not a simple summand of k \u2191H\nH0 . All other vertices\nG\nH\nare summands of k \u2191G0 and k \u2191H0 . There is one arrow from \u22c6k to \u22c4k since\nby identifying G1 /G0 and H1 /H0 , they are the trivial representations of this\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n21\n\nquotient group. Similarly, there is an arrow from \u22c6S to \u22c4\u01eb since they both\nare the sign representations of this quotient group.\nWe omit the detailed analysis of \u03b2 and \u03b4. Finally, we get the associated\nquiver Q as below:\n\u25e6\u01ebO\n\u25e6VO 2\n\u25e6kO\n\u2022\u03c9\n\n\u2022\u03c9 2\n\n\u2022k o\n\n\u22c4kO\n\n\u22c4\u01ebO\n\n\u22c6k\n\n\u22c6S\n\n\u22c4V2\n\nExample 4.4. Let C be a finite EI category with objects x and y; H =AutC (y)\nis a copy of the symmetric group S3 on 3 letters; G =AutC (x) is cyclic of\norder 2; HomC (x, y) = S3 regarded as an (H, G)-biset where H acts from the\nleft by multiplication, G acts from the right by multiplication after identifying\nG with a subgroup G\u2020 of S3 ; HomC (y, x) = \u2205.\nFrom the previous example, we find that Q has 5 vertices: \u25e6k and \u25e6S corresponding to x; \u2022k, \u2022V2 and \u2022\u01eb corresponding to y. We choose \u03b1 = 1 \u2208 S3\nas the representative unfactorizable morphism and then G0 = 1, G1 = G,\nH0 = 1, H1 = G\u2020 . As before, kG \u223c\n= k \u2295 \u01eb \u2295 V2 \u2295 V2 .\n= k \u2295 S, and kH \u223c\nH \u223c\nH \u223c\nH \u223c\nMoreover, k \u2193H1 = k, \u01eb \u2193H1 = S, V2 \u2193H1 = S \u2295 k. Thus the quiver Q is as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022k\n\n||\n||\n|\n|\n~|\n|\n\n\u25e6k C\n\nCC\nCC\nCC\nC!\n\n\u2022V2\n\nzz\nzz\nz\nz\nz} z\n\n\u25e6S A\n\nAA\nAA\nAA\nA\n\n\u2022\u01eb\n\nIn the above examples we find that the associated quivers are acyclic.\nMoreover, if C is a finite free EI category, the underlying quiver of a finite EI\nquiver Q\u0302 generating C is a subquiver of Q. This is always true.\nProposition 4.5. Let C be a finite EI category for which the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects have orders invertible in k. The associated quiver Q of C\nis acyclic. Moreover, if C is a finite free EI category generated by a finite EI\nquiver Q\u0302, then Q contains a subquiver isomorphic to the underlying quiver\nof Q\u0302.\nProof. It is obvious that the associated quiver Q of C contains no loops. Now\nlet S1 \u2192 . . . \u2192 Sn = S1 be an oriented cycle with at least 2 vertices (therefore\n\n\f22\nn > 3), where Si is a simple summand of kAutC (xi ), xi \u2208 Ob(C), 1 6 i 6\nn. Our construction shows that each arrow is induced by a unfactorizable\nmorphism in C. Therefore we get a string of unfactorizable morphisms\nx1\n\n\u03b12\n\n/\n\n...\n\n\u03b1n\u22121\n\n/\n\nxn\u22121\n\n\u03b1n\n\n/ xn\n\n= x1 .\n\nNotice that x2 6= x1 since \u03b12 is unfactorizable, hence not an automorphism.\nBut this implies that both HomC (x1 , x2 ) and HomC (x2 , x1 ) are non-empty,\nwhich is a contradiction (see the paragraphs before Definition 2.1), so the\nfirst statement is correct.\nNow suppose that C is a finite free EI category generated by a finite EI\nquiver Q\u0302. We know that vertices in Q\u0302 are exactly objects in C, and each\nobject x in C gives a unique vertex kx in Q, the trivial kAutC (x)-module.\nFurthermore, every arrow x \u2192 y in Q\u0302 corresponds to a unique representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y, which in turn determines, by our\nconstruction, a unique arrow from kx to ky in Q. By identifying x with kx ,\nwe get the second statement.\nThis associated quiver Q of C is actually the ordinary quiver of kC. To\nprove this, let us consider the radical of kC.\nProposition 4.6. Let C be a finite EI category for which the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects have orders invertible in k. Then rad kC has as a basis\nthe non-isomorphisms in C and rad kC/ rad2 kC has as a basis the images of\nall unfactorizable morphisms in C respectively.\nProof. Let \u039b be the subspace of kC spanned by all non-isomorphisms in C.\nClearly, \u039b is an two-sided ideal\nL of kC and it has the non-isomorphisms as\na basis. Moreover, kC/\u039b \u223c\n=\nx\u2208Ob(C) kEndC (x). Since the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects in C have orders invertible in k, all groups algebras\nare semisimple. Thus kC/\u039b is semisimple, and rad kC \u2286 \u039b. On the other\nhand, because C has only finitely many distinct objects, \u039b is nilpotent, so\n\u039b \u2286 rad kC. This proves \u039b = rad kC.\nAs an ideal of kC, rad2 kC contains all factorizable morphisms in C, and\nno unfactorizable morphism. Consequently, rad kC/ rad2 kC is spanned by\nthe images of all unfactorizable morphisms in C. Actually, these images form\na basis of rad kC/ rad2 kC.\nNow we restate and prove Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 4.7. Let C be a finite EI category for which the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects have orders invertible in the field k. Then the quiver Q\nconstructed by our algorithm is precisely the ordinary quiver of the category\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n23\n\n\u02c6 the\nalgebra kC. Moreover, kC has the same ordinary quiver as that of k C,\ncategory algebra of the free EI cover C\u02c6 of C.\nProof. Let Q\u2032 be the ordinary quiver of kC. We only need to show that there\nis a bijection \u03c0 from the vertices set of Q to the vertices set of Q\u2032 , and for\nevery pair of vertices v and w in Q, the number of arrows from v to w is the\nsame as that of the arrows from \u03c0(v) to \u03c0(w). By Corollary 4.5 of [7], a primitive idempotent of kC is exactly a primitive idempotent of kEndC (x) for some\nobject x. Moreover, if ex and ey are two primitive idempotents of kC associated with objects x and y respectively, then kCex \u223c\n= kCey if and only if x = y\n(since C is skeletal) and kEndC (x)ex \u223c\n= kEndC (x)ey (see the paragraph before Proposition 4.3 of [7]). Thus the vertices of Q\u2032 , formed by isomorphism\nclasses of indecomposable projective kC-modules, can be parametrized by isomorphism classes of indecomposable kEndC (x)-modules, where x ranges over\nthe objects in C. But because every kEndC (x) is semisimple, indecomposable projective kEndC (x)-modules and simple kEndC (x)-modules coincide.\nTherefore Q and Q\u2032 have the same vertices.\nNow let e1 and e2 be two primitive idempotents of kC corresponding to\nobjects x and y respectively. Let v = [kCe1 ] and w = [kCe2 ] be the corresponding vertices in Q\u2032 (or Q since they have the same vertices). We know\nthat the numbers of arrows in Q\u2032 from v to w is the dimension of the k-space\ne2 (radkC/rad2 kC)e1 . Let \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1l be all representative unfactorizable\nmorphisms from x to y. We verify that\ne2 (radkC/rad kC)e1 \u223c\n=\n2\n\nl\nM\n\ne2 (kH\u03b1i G)e1\n\ni=1\n\nby the previous proposition. Thus we only need to check that each representative unfactorizable morphism from x to y gives the same number of arrows\nfrom v to w as that given by our algorithm.\nTake a particular representative unfactorizable \u03b1 in the list \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1l .\nLet us compute the dimension of e2 (kH\u03b1G)e1. As we mentioned before, \u03b1\ndetermines groups H0 E H1 6 H, G0 E G1 6 G with H0 \u03b1 = \u03b1G0 = \u03b1 and\nH1 \u03b1 = \u03b1G1 , and k(G1 /G0 ) \u223c\n= k(H1 /H0 ). We identify these two modules\nand let {u1 , . . . , un } be a list of primitive idempotents of k(H1 /H0 ) such that\nevery simple sumand of k(H1 /H0 ) is isomorphic to some k(H1 /H0 )ui , and\nk(H1 /H0 )ui \u2247 k(H1 /H0 )uj if i 6= j for 1 6 i, j 6 n. Notice that all ui are\nprimitive idempotents of both kG1 and kH1 under the identification. Let\nUi = k(H1 /H0 )ui ,\nan\n\u223c a1\nkGe1 \u2193G\nG1 = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Un \u2295 U\n\n\f24\nand\n\nbn\n\u223c b1\nkHe2 \u2193H\nH1 = U1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Un \u2295 V\nsuch that both U \u223c\n= kG1 u and V \u223c\n= kH1 v have no summand isomorphic to\nany Ui , where u and v are idempotents of kG and kH respectively. Then by\nusing both the right and left module structure of kH\u03b1G we have:\n\ne2 kH\u03b1Ge1 \u223c\n= HomkH (kHe2 , kH\u03b1Ge1 )\n\u223c\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG, kH\u03b1G))\nM\n\u223c\nkh\u03b1G))\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG,\nh\u2208H/H1\n\n\u223c\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG, k\u03b1G) \u2191H\nH1 )\nM\n\u223c\nk\u03b1gG1) \u2191H\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG,\nH1 )\ng\u2208G\\G1\n\nH\n\u223c\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG, k\u03b1G1 \u2191G\nG1 ) \u2191 H1 )\n\u223c\n= HomkH (kHe2 , HomkG (e1 kG \u2193G , k\u03b1G1 ) \u2191H )\nG1\n\n1\n\nH1\n\nG\n\u223c\n= HomkH1 (kHe2 \u2193H\nH1 , HomkG1 (e1 kG \u2193G1 , k\u03b1G1 ))\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe last two isomorphisms come from the Frobenius Reciprocity. Also\nnotice that k\u03b1G1 = kH1 \u03b1 is a (kH1 , kG1 )-bimodule, which is isomorphic to\nk(G1 /G0 ) as a right kG1 -module and is isomorphic to k(H1 /H0 ) as a left\nkH1 -module. Moreover, the decomposition\n\u223c\nkGe1 \u2193G\nG1 =\n\nn\nM\n(kG1 ui )ai \u2295 kG1 u\ni=1\n\nas a left kG1 -module implies the decomposition\ne1 kG\n\n\u223c\n\u2193G\nG1 =\n\nn\nM\n(ui kG1 )ai \u2295 ukG1\ni=1\n\nas a right kG1 -module. Thus:\nHomkG1 (e1 kG\n\n\u2193G\nG1 , k\u03b1G1 )\n\n\u223c\n= HomkG1 (\n\nn\nM\n(ui kG1 )ai \u2295 ukG1 , k\u03b1G1 )\ni=1\n\nn\nn\nM\nM\nai\n\u223c\n\u223c\n(k\u03b1G1 ui )ai\n(ui kG1 ) , k\u03b1G1 ) =\n= HomkG1 (\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nn\nM\ni=1\n\n(kH1 \u03b1ui )ai \u223c\n=\n\nn\nM\ni=1\n\nUiai\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n25\n\nConsequently, we have:\nR.H.S of (4.1) \u223c\n= HomkH1 (kHe2 \u2193H\nH1 ,\n\nn\nM\n\nUiai )\n\ni=1\n\n\u223c\n= HomkH1 (\n\nn\nM\n\n\u223c\n= HomkH1 (\n\nn\nM\n\nUibi\n\n\u2295 V,\n\nUiai )\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nn\nM\n\nUibi ,\n\nn\nM\n\nUiai )\n\ni=1\n\nn\nM\n\u223c\n(HomkH1 (Ui , Ui ))ai bi\n=\ni=1\n\nP\nThe right hand side of the above identity has dimension ni=1 ai bi , which\nis the same as the number of arrows from the vertex v = [kCe1 ] to the vertex\nw = [kCe2 ] given by \u03b1 in our construction (see Step 2 and Step 3 of our\nalgorithm and Remark 4.2). This proves the first statement.\nBy Proposition 2.9, we know that C and its free EI cover C\u02c6 have the same\nobjects. Moreover, for each pair of objects x and y, we have EndC (x) =\nEnd\u0108 (x), EndC (y) = End\u0108 (y), and the unfactorizable morphisms from x to y\n\u02c6 But from the above proof we find that these\nin C are the same as those in C.\ndata completely determine their ordinary quivers. Thus k C\u02c6 and kC have the\nsame ordinary quiver, as we claimed.\n\n5\n\nHereditary Category Algebras\n\nIt is well known that the group algebra kG of a finite group G is hereditary\nif and only if the order of G is invertible in k, and the path algebra kQ of\na finite acyclic quiver Q is always hereditary. Since a finite EI category C\ncan be viewed as a combination of several finite groups and a finite acyclic\nquiver, it is convincing that a characterization of hereditary category algebras\nkC must be related closely to the following conditions: the endomorphism\ngroups of all objects in C have orders invertible in k, and C is a finite free\nEI category. These two conditions actually characterize finite EI categories\namong hereditary category algebras and this is the content of Theorem 1.2.\nLet us state some preliminary results which will be used in the proof of\nTheorem 1.2.\nLemma 5.1. Let \u03b11 and \u03b12 be two different unfactorizable morphisms in\na finite free EI category C. Then as kC-modules, either kC\u03b11 = kC\u03b12 , or\nkC\u03b11 \u2229 kC\u03b12 = 0.\n\n\f26\nProof. For i = 1, 2, let Bi = {\u03b4\u03b1i | \u03b4 \u2208 Mor(C), s(\u03b4) = t(\u03b1i )} be the set of\nall composites starting with \u03b1i , where s(\u03b4) and t(\u03b1i ) are the source of \u03b4 and\nthe target of \u03b1i respectively. Then Bi spans kC\u03b1i . If we can that prove B1\nand B2 are either the same, or have empty intersection, then the conclusion\nfollows.\nSuppose that B1 \u2229 B2 is nonempty. Then we can find \u03b2 \u2208 B1 \u2229 B2 and\n\u03b2 can be expressed as \u03b41 \u03b11 = \u03b42 \u03b12 . But C is a finite free EI category and\nsatisfies the UFP, so \u03b11 and \u03b12 have the same source x and the same target\ny. Moreover, there is an automorphism h \u2208 EndC (y) such that \u03b11 = h\u03b12\nand \u03b41 = \u03b42 h\u22121 . In particular, \u03b11 \u2208 B2 and \u03b12 \u2208 B1 . Thus B1 = B2 , which\ncompletes the proof.\nLemma 5.2. Let \u03b1 : x \u2192 y be an unfactorizable morphism in a finite free EI\ncategory for which all endomorphisms groups of objects have orders invertible\nin k. Then the cyclic kC-module kC\u03b1 is projective.\nProof. Let H = EndC (y) and H0 = StabH (\u03b1). Since the order of H is\ninvertible in k, the\nP subgroup H0 has invertible order in k, too. Thus we can\ndefine e = |H10 | h\u2208H0 h \u2208 kH \u2286 kC. Since e is an idempotent of kC, it\nfollows that kCe is a projective kC-module. We will show that kC\u03b1 \u223c\n= kCe as\nkC-modules.\nDefine a map \u03c6 : kC\u03b1 \u2192 kCe by letting \u03c6(r\u03b1) = re, where r \u2208 kC. We\nclaim that \u03c6 is a kC-module isomorphism.\nPm\nFirst,\nwe\nwant\nto\nshow\nthat\n\u03c6\nis\nwell-defined.\nThat\nis,\nif\ni=1 ai \u03b4i \u03b1 =\nPn\nin kC\u03b1, where\nj=1 bj \u03b2j \u03b1 are two different expressions of a vectorP\nPani , bj \u2208 k,\nm\ne = j=1 bj \u03b2j e.\n\u03b4i , \u03b2j \u2208 Mor(C) are morphisms starting\nP at y, then i=1 ai \u03b4iP\nm\na\n\u03b4\n\u03b1\n=\n0,\nthen\nThis is equivalent to saying that if m\ni=1 ai \u03b4i e = 0,\ni=1 i i\nwhere all \u03b4i are pairwise distinct morphisms starting at y.\nThose \u03b4i \u03b1 might not be all distinct. By changing the indices if necessary,\nwe can suppose that \u03b41 \u03b1 = . . . = \u03b4i1 \u03b1, \u03b4i1 +1 \u03b1 = . . . = \u03b4i2 \u03b1, and so on until\n\u03b4il\u22121 +1 \u03b1 = . . . = \u03b4il \u03b1, where \u03b4i1 \u03b1, \u03b4i2 \u03b1, . . . , \u03b4il \u03b1 are pairwise distinct and\n\u03b4il = \u03b4m . From the definition of the category algebra, \u03b4i1 \u03b1, . . . , \u03b4il \u03b1 are in\nfact linearly independent. Thus we have:\nm\nX\n\nai \u03b4i \u03b1 = (a1 \u03b41 \u03b1 + . . . + ai1 \u03b4i1 \u03b1) + . . . + (ail\u22121 +1 \u03b4il\u22121 +1 \u03b1 + . . . + ail \u03b4il \u03b1)\n\ni=1\n\n= (a1 + . . . + ai1 )\u03b4i1 \u03b1 + . . . + (ail\u22121 +1 + . . . + ail )\u03b4il \u03b1\nNotice that (a1 + . . . + ai1 ) = . . . = (ail\u22121 +1 + . . . + ail ) = 0 by the\nindependence of the \u03b4ij \u03b1, 1 6 j 6 l. We want to show that each term\n(aij\u22121 +1 + . . . + aij )\u03b4ij \u03b1 is sent to 0 by \u03c6. Observe that since \u03b4s \u03b1 = \u03b4ij \u03b1 for\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n27\n\nall 1 6 s 6 ij , by the UFP, there are hs \u2208 EndC (y) such that hs \u03b1 = \u03b1 and\n\u03b4s = \u03b4ij h\u22121\ns . In particular, hs \u2208 H0 . Thus:\n\u03c6(\n\nij\nX\ns=1\n\nas \u03b4s \u03b1) =\n\nij\nX\ns=1\n\nas \u03b4s e =\n\nij\nX\n\nas \u03b4ij h\u22121\ns e\n\ns=1\n\nBut all h\u22121\n\u2208 H0 fix e, i.e., h\u22121\ns\ns e = e, so the right side of the above\nPij\nidentity is actually ( s=1 as )\u03b4ij e = 0. This shows that \u03c6 sends each term to\n0, and hence is well-defined.\nPm\nPm\nNow suppose\ni \u03b4i \u03b1) =\ni=1 ai \u03b4i e = 0. Since e fixes \u03b1, i.e., e\u03b1 =\nPm \u03c6( i=1 aP\nm\n\u03b1, we have i=1 ai \u03b4i \u03b1 = ( i=1 ai \u03b4i e)\u03b1 = 0. Thus this map is injective.\nIt is clear that \u03c6 is surjective and is a kC-module homomorphism. In\nconclusion, \u03c6 is a kC-module isomorphism. The conclusion is proved.\nLet us restate Theorem 1.2 and give a proof here.\nTheorem 5.3. Let C be a finite EI category C. Then kC is hereditary if and\nonly if C is a finite free EI category satisfying that the endomorphism groups\nof all objects have orders invertible in k.\nProof. If C has only one object, the conclusion holds obviously. Without loss\nof generality, we suppose that C has more than one object.\nThe if part. By Corollary 5.2 on page 17 of [1], it suffices to prove\nthat \u039b = rad kC is a projective kC-module. By Proposition 4.6, \u039b has as a\nbasis all non-isomorphisms in C. By Proposition 2.6, \u039b as a kC-module is\nthe sum of all submodules of the form kC\u03b1, where \u03b1 ranges all unfactorizable morphisms in C. By Lemma 5.1, any two of them either coincide, or\nhave a trivial intersection. Therefore, \u039b is the direct sum of some of these\nsubmodules. But all these submodules are projective by Lemma 5.2, so \u039b is\nalso projective.\nThe only if part. Let C be a finite EI category such that kC is hereditary,\nwe first show that all endomorphism groups of objects have orders invertible\nin k. If this is not true, then C has an object x whose endomorphism group\nG = EndC (x) has order not invertible in k. Let kx be the simple kC-module\nwhich is k on x, and 0 on other objects. Let P \u2192 kx be a minimal kCprojective resolution of kx . By Lemma 5.1.1 of [10], it induces a projective\nresolution P(x) \u2192 k of kAutC (x)-modules. Since AutC (x) has order not\ninvertible in k, this induced projective resolution has infinite length, so P \u2192\nkx must be of infinite length. This is impossible since kC is hereditary.\nConsequently, all endomorphism groups of objects in C have orders invertible\nin k.\n\n\f28\nNext we prove that C is a finite free EI category. By Proposition 2.9,\nthere is a full functor F\u0302 : C\u02c6 \u2192 C, where C\u02c6 is the free EI cover of C. Moreover,\nF\u0302 is the identity map restricted to objects, isomorphisms and unfactorizable\nmorphisms. By Lemma 2.12, C\u02c6 gives a surjective algebra homomorphism\n\u03c8 : k C\u02c6 \u2192 kC. Since C\u02c6 and C have the same objects, and the same endomorphism group for each object, we know from Proposition 4.3 of [7] that\n\u02c6\nevery simple kC-module can be viewed as a simple k C-module,\ngiving all\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nsimple k C-modules. Moreover, kC and k C have the same ordinary quiver\n(Theorem 4.7). We know that k C\u02c6 is a hereditary algebra by the conclusion\nwe just proved. Therefore, both kC and k C\u02c6 are hereditary algebras with\nthe same simple modules and the same ordinary quiver. But for a hereditary algebra, these data completely determine the dimension of this algebra.\nConsequently, kC and k C\u02c6 have the same dimension, so \u03c8 is an isomorphism\nand the functor F\u0302 : C\u02c6 \u2192 C must be bijective on morphisms. Therefore, F\u0302\n\u02c6 so is a\nis an isomorphism of categories. In conclusion, C is isomorphic to C,\nfinite free EI category.\nCorollary 5.4. The category algebra kC of a finite EI category C is hereditary\nif and only if for all full subcategories D of C, the category algebras kD are\nhereditary.\nProof. One side is trivial since C is a full subcategory of itself. Now assume\nthat kC is hereditary. By the previous theorem, C is a finite free EI category\nwhose endomorphism groups of objects have orders invertible in k. If D is\na full subcategory of C, then by Proposition 2.10, D is also a finite free EI\ncategory for which all endomorphism groups of objects obviously have orders\ninvertible in k. By the above theorem again, kD is hereditary.\nCorollary 5.5. Let C be a finite free EI category for which all endomorphism\ngroups of objects have orders invertible in k. Then C is of finite (tame, resp.)\nrepresentation type if and only if its ordinary quiver has underlying graph a\ndisjoint union of Dynkin (Euclidean, resp.) diagrams. Otherwise, it has wild\nrepresentation type.\nProof. The conclusion comes from the previous theorem and the classification\nof representation types of quivers.\nAs an application of this theorem, we assert that the categories shown in\nExample 4.3 and Example 4.4 have finite representation type over fields k\nwhose characteristic is not 2 or 3.\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n6\n\n29\n\nApplication to Representation Types\n\nTo determine the representation type of a finite EI category C is an interesting but challenging problem. In this section we only consider the finite EI\ncategories C for which the endomorphism groups of all objects have orders\ninvertible in k. Under this hypothesis, we can construct the ordinary quiver\nQ of kC according to the algorithm described in section 4. If furthermore C\nis a finite free EI category, its representation type is completely determined\nby Corollary 5.5. Otherwise, kC is Morita equivalent to kQ/I, where I is an\nnontrivial admissible ideal of kQ. Thus kC is of finite representation type if\nso is kQ, which is precisely Proposition 2.13 since kC is Morita equivalent to\nkQ.\nIt is well known that if a quiver Q has a subquiver of infinite representation type, Q is of infinite representation type as well. This conclusion holds\nfor finite groups. Finite EI categories have a similar property:\nProposition 6.1. A finite EI category C is of infinite representation type if\nit has a full subcategory D of infinite representation type.\nProof. Let M be an indecomposable kD-module. By Theorem 4.4.2 of [10],\nthe induced module M \u2191CD is an indecomposable kC-module. Moreover, M\nis D-projective, i.e., M | M \u2191CD \u2193CD . This implies that every indecomposable\nkD-module M is a direct summand of M\u0303 \u2193CD , where M\u0303 is an indecomposable kC-module. If C is of finite representation type, it has only finitely\nmany non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. But the restriction of these\nmodules to D can produce only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable kD-modules, and hence D is of finite representation type, which is a\ncontradiction!\nNow let us consider full subcategories of C. The subcategories with one\nobject always have finite representation type since their category algebras\nare precisely semisimple group algebras. They cannot provide us much information about the representation type of C. Without loss of generality\nwe suppose that C has more than one object. Consider the connected subcategories with two objects. Since they are always finite free EI categories,\nwe can completely determine their representation types by constructing the\nordinary quivers. Fortunately, these categories give us many useful details\nabout the representation type of C.\nLet D be a connected full subcategory formed by two distinct objects\nx and y. From the previous proposition we know that if D is of infinite\nrepresentation type, so is C. Let G = AutD (x), H = AutD (y).\n\n\f30\nCorollary 6.2. With the above notation, if HomD (x, y) has more than one\norbit as an (H, G)-biset, then D, hence C are of infinite representation type.\nProof. Notice that every morphism in HomD (x, y) is unfactorizable. If it has\nmore than one orbit, then D has at least two representative unfactorizable\nmorphisms which are not in the same biset orbit. Take two representative\nunfactorizable morphisms \u03b1 6= \u03b2 lying in different biset orbits and consider\nthe ordinary quiver Q of D. It contains two vertices kx and ky , the trivial\nrepresentations of G and H respectively. Since both \u03b1 and \u03b2 give an arrow\nfrom kx to ky by our algorithm, there are at least two arrows from kx to ky .\nThus Q contains multiple arrows and is of infinite representation type. By\nCorollary 5.5, D, hence C are of infinite representation type.\nRemark 6.3. We comment that Proposition 6.1 and Corollary 6.2 are always\ntrue over all algebraically closed fields k, no matter what the characteristic of\nk is. We strengthen Corollary 6.2 under the hypothesis that all endomorphism\ngroups have orders invertible in k.\nBy this corollary, we suppose that HomD (x, y) has only one orbit as an\n(H, G)-biset.\nCorollary 6.4. With the above notation, if neither G nor H acts transitively\non HomD (x, y), then D, hence C are of infinite representation type.\nProof. Since HomD (x, y) has only one orbit as an (H, G)-biset, it is generated by one morphism, say \u03b1. As before, we define G0 = StabG (\u03b1),\nH0 = StabH (\u03b1), G1 = StabG (H\u03b1), H1 = StabH (\u03b1G). Because neither G\nnor H acts transitively on HomD (x, y), G1 is a proper subgroup of G, and\nH1 is a proper subgroup of H.\nLet us consider the kG-module k \u2191G\nG1 . We claim it has exactly one isomorphic copy of the trivial kG-module k as a direct summand. Indeed,\nG\n\u223c\n\u223c\nHomkG (k, k \u2191G\nG1 ) = HomkG1 (k \u2193G1 , k) = HomkG1 (k, k) = k, which implies\nthe claim. But the dimension of k \u2191G\nG1 is strictly bigger than 1 since G1 is a\nproper subgroup of G, so it has another simple summand S not isomorphic to\nG\nG\n\u223c\nk. Again HomkG1 (k, S \u2193G\nG1 ) = HomkG (k \u2191G1 , S) 6= 0, and therefore S \u2193G1 has\na trivial summand k. With the same reasoning, we can find a simple summand T | k \u2191H\nH1 such that T is not isomorphic to the trivial representation k\nof H, but T \u2193H\nH1 has a trivial summand k.\nConsider the ordinary quiver Q of D. It contains at least four vertices: kx\nand ky which are the trivial modules of kG and kH respectively, S, and T .\nBy our construction, the representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 induces\nH\n\u223c\nan arrow kx \u2192 ky and at least one arrow kx \u2192 T since kx \u2193G\nG1 = k | T \u2193 H1\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n31\n\nunder the identification. It also gives at least one arrow from S to ky and at\nleast one arrow from S to T . Thus we get a subquiver of Q, pictured below:\n/ ky\n@@ ~~?\n@~@~\n~~ @@@\n~\n~\n/T\n\nkx @\nS\n\nIt is clear that the above subquiver is of infinite representation type, so\nQ is of infinite representation type as well. By Corollary 5.5, D, hence C are\nof infinite representation type.\nNow without loss of generality we suppose that H acts transitively on\nHomD (x, y) (otherwise consider the opposite category C op , which has the\nsame representation type as C), so that G0 is a normal subgroup of G = G1 .\nH\n1\nCorollary 6.5. Let S be a simple summand of k \u2191H\nH0 . If S \u2191H1 is not\nmultiplicity free, or has more than 3 summands, then D, hence C are of\ninfinite representation type.\nH\nProof. Notice that k \u2191G\nG0 , after it is identified with k \u2191H0 , has a simple\nsummand isomorphic to S. Denote this kG-module S \u2032 to avoid confusion.\nLet T be a simple summand of S \u2191H\nH1 . Since\nH\n\u223c\nHomkH1 (S, T \u2193H\nH1 ) = HomkH (S \u2191H1 , T ) 6= 0,\nH\nS is a simple summand of T \u2193H\nH1 . Moreover, S \u2191H1 has more than one\nH\nsummand isomorphic to T if and only if T \u2193H1 has more than one summand\nisomorphic to S.\nConsider the ordinary quiver Q of D. Both S \u2032 and T are vertices in Q\nsince they are a simple kG-module and a simple kH-module respectively. If\nH\nS \u2191H\nH1 has more than one summand isomorphic to T , then T \u2193H1 has more\nthan one summand isomorphic to S. Thus there are multiple arrows from\nthe vertex S \u2032 to the vertex T , and Q is of infinite representation type.\nNow suppose S \u2191H\nH1 has more than 3 summands. If it is not multiplicity\nfree, we are done. Otherwise, all summands are pairwise non-isomorphic.\nThus S \u2191H\nH1 has at least four pairwise non-isomorphic simple summands, say\nT1 , T2 , T3 and T4 . They are different vertices in Q. By our construction,\nthere are arrows from the vertex S \u2032 to each of Ti , 1 6 i 6 4. As a result,\nthe underlying graph of Q has a component whose underlying graph is not a\ndisjoint union of Dynkin diagrams. Thus Q is of infinite representation type.\nThe conclusion follows from Corollary 5.5.\n\n\f32\nWe end this section with a finite EI category of infinite representation\ntype.\nExample 6.6. Let C be a finite EI category with: Ob(C) = {x, y}, AutC (x) =\n1, AutC (y) is a copy of the symmetric group S3 on three letters, which acts\non HomC (x, y) = S3 by multiplication from left, HomC (y, x) = \u2205.\nIt is not hard to construct the ordinary quiver of this category, as shown\nbelow and it has infinite representation type.\n\u25e6V\nO O2\n\u25e6k o\n\n7\n\n\u2022k\n\n/\n\n\u25e6\u01eb\n\nAppendix\n\nIn section 5 we proved that kC is hereditary if and only if C is a finite free EI\ncategory for which all endomorphism groups of objects have orders invertible\nin k. In this section we will construct a functor F : kC-mod \u2192 kQ-mod for\nsuch C, where Q is the ordinary quiver of kC constructed by our algorithm in\nsection 4. This functor is faithful, dense and full, and hence induces a Morita\nequivalence between kC and kQ. This construction of F actually motivated\nTheorem 1.2, and gives a proof of its if part.\nDefinition of F on objects. We let R be a representation of C and show\nhow to define a representation R\u2032 of its ordinary quiver Q. Take a fixed vertex\nV in Q. By our construction, V is a simple kAutC (x)-module for an object\nx in C. Let the homogeneous space R(x)(V ) of V in the kEndC (x)-module\nR(x) be V a , the direct sum of a copies of V . We then define R\u2032 (V ) = k a .\nIn this way we assign a vector space to each vertex in Q. Repeating this\nprocess, R\u2032 assigns a vector space to each vertex in Q.\nNow we want to define a linear map for every arrow V \u2192 W in Q. By\nRemark 4.2, this arrow is indexed by a list (\u03b1, V, W, U, s, l) where \u03b1 : x \u2192\ny is an representative unfactorizable morphism. This morphism uniquely\ndetermines and is uniquely determined by the following data (see the notation\nbefore Lemma 4.1 and Remark 4.2):\n\u2022 the groups G0 E G1 6 G and H0 E H1 6 H;\n\u2022 a kG-module R(x) = M with M(V ) \u223c\n= V a , and a kH-module R(y) = N\nb\nwith N(W ) \u223c\n=W ;\n\u2022 the subspaces M(V, U, s) \u2286 M and N(W, U, l) \u2286 N.\n\n\f33\n\nA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\nThe linear map \u03c6 = R(\u03b1) : R(x) \u2192 R(y) induces a linear map \u03c6\u2032 , the\ncomposite of the following maps, where all inclusions and projections are\ndefined as before:\n\u03c6\u2032 : M(V, U, s) \u001f\n\u007f\n/\n\nM\n\n\u03c6\n\n/\n\nN\n\n//\n\nN(W, U, l).\n\nNotice that M(V, U, s) \u223c\n= U b since\n= V a , N(W, U, l) \u223c\n= U a since M(V ) \u223c\nN(W ) \u223c\n= W b . By Lemma 3.5 and Remark 3.7, the derived map from a\nparticular isomorphic copy of U in M(V, U, s) into a particular isomorphic\ncopy of U in N(V, U, l) is 0, or a k(G1 /G0 )-module isomorphism. Both cases\ngive a scalar multiplication \u03bb since U is a simple k(G1 /G0 )-module. Thus\n\u03c6\u2032 gives the following b \u00d7 a block matrix B\u0303, where I is the dimU \u00d7 dimU\nidentity matrix.

Define F (R) = R\u2032 .\nDefinition of F on morphisms. Let \u03c0 = {\u03c6x : x \u2208 Ob(C)} be a\nhomomorphism from a kC-module R1 to another kC-module R2 .

The above proof actually implies that diagram (7.4) commutes\nif and only if diagram (7.2) commutes.\n\n\f36\nTherefore, F maps a kC-module homomorphism to a kQ-module homomorphism. F also preserves the homomorphism composition since matrix\nproduct preserves composition. Thus F is indeed a functor from Repk C to\nRepk Q.\nLet us use Example 4.4 to show how a representation of C gives a representation of the associated quiver Q and vice versa.\nExample 7.3. Let R be a representation of the finite EI category C shown in\nExample 4.4 with: R(x) = hv1 i\u2295hv2 i\u2295hv3 i \u223c\n= k \u2295k \u2295S; R(y) = hw1 i\u2295hw2i\u2295\n\u223c\n\u223c\nhw3 , w4i \u2295 hw5 , w6 i = k \u2295 \u01eb \u2295 V2 \u2295 V2 . Moreover, since V2 \u2193H\nH1 = k \u2295 S, we\nassume that w3 and w5 both generate the trivial submodules on restriction to\nH1 , and w4 and w6 both generates submodules isomorphic to S on restriction\nto H1 .\nWe already know from Example 4.4 that \u03b1 = 1 \u2208 S3 can be chosen as the\nunique representative unfactorizable morphism in C. Let \u03c6 = R(\u03b1). Then\n\u03c6(v1 ) and \u03c6(v2 ) are in the subspace of R(y) generated by w1 , w3 , w5, and\n\u03c6(v3 ) lies in the subspace generated by w2 , w4 , w6 . Thus \u03c6 has the following\nmatrix representation:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03bb11 \u03bb21 0\n\uf8ef 0\n0 \u03bb32 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\u03bb13 \u03bb23 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0\n0 \u03bb34 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\u03bb15 \u03bb25 0 \uf8fb\n0\n0 \u03bb36\nThe induced representation\nR\u2032 \u0014of Q\u0015 is described below, where M1 =\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb11 \u03bb21 , M2 = 13 23 , M3 = 34 , and M4 = \u03bb32 .\n\u03bb36\n\u03bb15 \u03bb25\nk2 @\nk\n\n\u007f\n\nM1\n\nk ==\n\n@@ M\n@@ 2\n@@\n\nk\n\n2\n\n\u007f\n\nM3\n\n== M4\n==\n==\n\u001e\n\nk\n\nThe reader can easily recover R from R\u2032 .\nProposition 7.4.

That is, D commutes if and only if all Dij\ncommute.\nNow let us prove the previous proposition.\nProof. F is dense (or essentially surjective). First, we show the algorithm giving a representation of Q from a representation of C is invertible.\nThat is: given a representation R\u2032 of Q, we can define a representation R of C\nsuch that F (R) \u223c\n= R\u2032 . By Proposition 3.1, it suffices to define a rule R which\nassigns a kAutC (x)-module to each object x, a linear transformation to each\nunfactorizable morphism, so that R restricted to D\u03b1 is a representation of\nD\u03b1 for every representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1 (see the definition of\nD\u03b1 in section 3).\nAn object x gives a family of vertices {V1 , . . . , Vm } in Q. If R\u2032 (Vi ) = k ai ,\nthen we define R(x) = M = V1a1 \u2295. . .\u2295Vmam . This definition gives a kAutC (x)\n\n\f38\n-module for every object x in C. Now we construct a linear map R(\u03b1) : M =\nR(x) \u2192 N = R(y) for each representative unfactorizable morphism \u03b1. As we\nmentioned before, M as a vector space is the direct sum of all subspaces of the\nform M(V, U, s), and N as a vector space is the direct sum of all subspaces\nof the form N(W, T, l) (see the paragraph before Lemma 4.1). Thus it is\nenough to define linear maps from M(V, U, s) into N(W, T, l).\nThe morphism \u03b1 determines groups G0 E G1 6 G. By Remark 3.7, the\nderived map \u03c6\u2032 : M(V, U, s) \u2192 N(W, T, l) by \u03c6 should be a k(G1 /G0 )-module\n1\n\u223c\nhomomorphism if U \u223c\n= T | k \u2191G\nG0 under the given identification G1 /G0 =\nH1 /H0 ; and 0 otherwise. If it is a k(G1 /G0 )-module homomorphism, then\nU \u223c\n= T and the list (\u03b1, V, W, U, s, l) uniquely determines an arrow from the\nj=1,...,a\nvertex V to the vertex W . Let B = (\u03bbji )i=1,...,b\nbe the matrix representation\n\u2032\nof the linear map assigned to this arrow by R . It provides a unique block\nj=1,...,a\nmatrix B\u0303 = (\u03bbji I)i=1,...,b\n, where I is the dimU \u00d7 dimU identity matrix. This\nblock matrix B\u0303 gives a linear map from M(V, U, s) to N(W, T, l) under the\nchosen decomposition of V \u2193G\nG1 . All these maps determine a linear map from\nM to N, which can be defined as R(\u03b1). Repeating this process, we can define\na linear map for each representative unfactorizable morphism.\nBy Lemma 3.6, the rule R we just defined is a representation of D\u03b1 while\nrestricted to each D\u03b1 . By Proposition 3.1, R gives a representation of C.\nBy abuse of notation, we denote it by R. It is direct to verify that F (R) is\nisomorphic to R\u2032 . Thus F is dense.\nF is faithful. Let R1 and R2 be two kC-modules and \u03c0 = {\u03c6x | x \u2208\nOb(C)} be a kC-module homomorphism from R1 to R2 . Let V be a vertex\nin Q and x be the object in C corresponding to V . Let \u03c6x : M1 = R1 (x) \u2192\nM2 = R2 (x) be the kAutC (x)-module homomorphism in \u03c0, which is the direct sum of \u03c6V : M1 (V ) \u2192 M2 (V ) for all simple summands V of M1 . If\nF (\u03c0) = {\u03c6\u2032V : V is a vertex in Q} is 0, then in particular \u03c6\u2032V = 0 and therefore \u03c6V = 0 (see Remark 7.1). Since V is an arbitrary summand of M1 , we\nhave \u03c6x = 0. Consequently, \u03c0 is 0.\nF is full. Let \u03c0 \u2032 = {\u03c6\u2032V : V is a vertex in Q} be a kQ-module homomorphism from F (R1 ) = R1\u2032 to F (R2 ) = R2\u2032 . We can recover a kC-module\nhomomorphism \u03c0 = {\u03c6x | x \u2208 Ob(C)} from \u03c0 \u2032 such that F (\u03c0) = \u03c0 \u2032 . Indeed,\nto define \u03c6x : M1 = R1 (x) \u2192 M2 = R2 (x) for a fixed object x, it is enough to\ndefine \u03c6V : M1 (V ) \u2192 M2 (V ), where V is a simple summand of M1 . According to Remark 7.1, \u03c6V could be recovered from \u03c6\u2032V \u2208 \u03c0 \u2032 . In this way we get\nfrom \u03c0 \u2032 a family of linear transformations \u03c0 = {\u03c6x | x \u2208 Ob(C)}. Clearly,\nF (\u03c0) and \u03c0 \u2032 have the same matrix representation, i.e., F (\u03c0) = \u03c0 under the\n\n\fA Characterization of Finite EI Categories with Hereditary Category Algebras\n\n39\n\nchosen decompositions and the chosen bases. The only thing which remains\nis to show that \u03c0 is indeed a kC-module homomorphism. By Proposition 3.2,\nwe only need to verify that diagram (7.2) commutes for every representative\nunfactorizable morphism \u03b1 : x \u2192 y.\nThe kAutC (x)-module M1 (M2 , resp.) is a direct sum of subspaces of\nthe form M1 (V, U, s) (M2 (V, U, s), resp.). The kAutC (y)-module N1 (N2 ) is\na direct sum of subspace of the form N1 (W, T, l) (N2 (W, T, l), resp.). By\nLemma 7.1, it is enough to check that for an arbitrary Mi (V, U, s) and an\narbitrary Ni (W, T, l), i = 1, 2, diagram (7.2) commutes. The morphism \u03b1\ndetermines groups G0 E G1 6 G. Again by Lemma 3.5 and Remark 3.7,\nthe maps \u03c6\u2032i : Mi (V, U, s) \u2192 Ni (W, T, l) derived from \u03c6i , i = 1, 2, are 0 or\nk(G1 /G0 )-module homomorphisms under the given identification. If they are\n1\n0, the diagram commutes trivially. Otherwise, U \u223c\n= T | k \u2191G\nG0 , and the list\n(\u03b1, V, W, U, s, l) determines an arrow. The linear maps assigned to this arrow\nby R1\u2032 and R2\u2032 , combined with \u03c6\u2032V and \u03c6\u2032W give the commutative diagram\n(7.4). By Remark 7.2 the diagram (7.2) also commutes. Thus \u03c0 is indeed a\nkC-module homomorphism and F (\u03c0) = \u03c0 \u2032 . That is, F is full.\nWe proved that F is dense, faithful and full. By Theorem 1 on page 91\nof [4] F gives rise to a Morita equivalence between kQ and kC. This finishes\nthe proof.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Auslander, I. Reiten, and S.
