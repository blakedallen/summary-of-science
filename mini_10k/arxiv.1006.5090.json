In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a necessary and sufficient condition for distribution-free PAC learnability of a concept\nclass C under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain\n\u03a9.

Besides, learnability of C under non-atomic measures does not imply the uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli property\nwith regard to non-atomic measures. Our learnability criterion is stated in terms\nof a combinatorial parameter VC(C mod \u03c91 ) which we call the VC dimension\nof C modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by \"thickening up\"\nsingle points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable \"clusters\". Equivalently, VC(C mod \u03c91 ) \u2264 d if and only if every countable subclass of C has VC\ndimension \u2264 d outside a countable subset of \u03a9. The new parameter can be also\nexpressed as the classical VC dimension of C calculated on a suitable subset of\na compactification of \u03a9. We do not make any measurability assumptions on C ,\nassuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA).\n\n1 Introduction\nA fundamental result of statistical learning theory says that for a concept class C the\nthree conditions are equivalent: (1) C is distribution-free PAC learnable over the family\nP(\u03a9) of all probability measures on the domain \u03a9, (2) C is a uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli\nclass with regard to P(\u03a9), and (3) the Vapnik\u2013Chervonenkis dimension of C is finite\n[VC,BEHW]. In this paper we are interested in the problem, discussed by Vidyasagar\nin both editions of his book [V1,V2] as problem 12.8, of giving a similar combinatorial\ndescription of concept classes C which are PAC learnable under the family Pna (\u03a9) of\nall non-atomic probability measures on \u03a9. (A measure \u03bc is non-atomic, or diffuse, if\nevery set A of strictly positive measure contains a subset B with 0 < \u03bc(B) < \u03bc(A).)\nThe condition VC(C ) < \u221e, while of course sufficient for C to be learnable under\nPna (\u03a9), is not necessary. Let a concept class C consist of all finite and all cofinite\nsubsets of a standard Borel space \u03a9. Then VC(C ) = \u221e, and moreover C is clearly\nnot a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class with regard to non-atomic measures. At the same\ntime, C is PAC learnable under non-atomic measures: any learning rule L consistent\nwith the subclass {\u2205, \u03a9} will learn C . Notice that C is not consistently learnable under\nnon-atomic measures: there are consistent learning rules mapping every training sample\nto a finite set, and they will not learn any cofinite subset of \u03a9.\n\n\fThe point of this example is that PAC learnability of a concept class C under nonatomic measures is not affected by adding to C symmetric differences C \u25b3 N for each\nC \u2208 C and every countable set N.\nA version of VC dimension oblivious to this kind of set-theoretic \"noise\" is obtained\nfrom the classical definition by \"thickening up\" individual points and replacing them\nwith uncountable clusters (Figure 1).\nC\n\nA1\n\n\u03a9\nA2\n\n...\n\nAi\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n000111\n00 111\n11\n000\n000\n111\n000\n000111\n000 111\n111\n000\n000\n111\n00111\n000 11\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\nA\n\nj\n\nFig. 1. A family A1 , A2 , . . . , An of uncountable sets shattered by C .\n\nDefine the VC dimension of a concept class C modulo countable sets as the supremum of natural n for which there exists a family of n uncountable sets, A1 , A2 , . . . , An \u2286\n\u03a9, shattered by C in the sense that for each J \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , n}, there is C \u2208 C which\ncontains all sets Ai , i \u2208 J, and is disjoint from all sets A j , j < J. Denote this parameter\nby VC(C mod \u03c91 ). Clearly, for every concept class C\nVC(C mod \u03c91 ) \u2264 VC(C ).\nIn our example above, one has VC(C mod \u03c91 ) = 1, even as VC(C ) = \u221e.\nHere is our main result.\nTheorem 1. Let (\u03a9, A ) be a standard Borel space, and let C \u2286 A be a concept class.\nUnder the Martin's Axiom (MA), the following are equivalent.\n1. C is PAC learnable under the family of all non-atomic measures.\n2. VC(C mod \u03c91 ) = d < \u221e.\n3. Every countable subclass C \u2032 \u2286 C has finite VC dimension on the complement to\nsome countable subset of \u03a9 (which depends on C \u2032 ).\n4. There is d such that for every countable C \u2032 \u2286 C one has VC(C \u2032 ) \u2264 d on the\ncomplement to some countable subset of \u03a9 (depending on C \u2032 ).\n5. Every countable subclass C \u2032 \u2286 C is a uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli class with regard\nto the family of non-atomic measures.\n6. Same, with sample complexity s(\u01eb, \u03b4) which only depends on C and not on C \u2032 .\nIf C is universally separable [P], the above are also equivalent to:\n7. VC dimension of C is finite outside of a countable subset of \u03a9.\n8. C is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class with respect to the family of non-atomic\nprobability measures.\n\n\fMartin's Axiom (MA) [F] is one of the most often used and best studied additional\nset-theoretic assumptions beyond the standard Zermelo-Frenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). In particular, Martin's Axiom follows from the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), but it is also compatible with the negation of CH, and in fact it is namely\nthe combination MA+\u00acCH that is really interesting.\nThe concept class in our initial simple example (which is even image admissible\nSouslin [D]) shows that in general (7) and (8) are not equivalent to the remaining conditions. Notice that for universally separable classes, (1), (7) and (8) are equivalent\nwithout additional set-theoretic assumptions.\nThe core of the theorem - and the main technical novelty of our paper - is the\nproof of the implication (3)\u21d2(1). It is based on a special choice of a consistent learning\nrule L having the property that for every concept C \u2208 C , the image of all learning\nsamples of the form (\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3) under L forms a uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli class. It is\nfor establishing this property of L that we need Martin's Axiom.\nMost of the remaining implications are relavely straightforward adaptations of the\nstandard techniques of statistical learning. Nevertheless, (2)\u21d2(3) requires a certain\ntechnical dexterity, and we study this implication in the setting of Boolean algebras.\nWe begin the paper by reviewing a general formal setting, followed by a dicussion\nof Boolean algebras which seem like a natural framework for the problem at hand, especially in view of possible generalizations to learning under other intermediate families\nof measures.\nIn particular, we will show that our version of the VC dimension modulo countable sets, VC(C mod \u03c91 ), is just the usual VC dimension of the class C of concepts\nextended over a suitable compactification of \u03a9 and restricted to a certain subdomain of\nthe compactification.\nNow the part of Theorem 1 for universally separable concept classes follows easily.\nAfterwards, we discuss Martin's Axiom, prove the existence of a learning rule with the\nabove special property, and deduce Theorem 1 for arbitrary concept classes.\n\n2 The setting\nWe need to fix a precise setting, which is mostly standard. The domain (instance space)\n\u03a9 = (\u03a9, A ) is a measurable space, that is, a set \u03a9 equipped with a sigma-algebra of\nsubsets A . Typically, \u03a9 is assumed to be a standard Borel space, that is, a complete separable metric space equipped with the sigma-algebra of Borel subsets. We will clarify\nthe assumption whenever necessary.\nA concept class is a family, C , of measurable subsets of \u03a9. (Equivalently, C can be\nviewed as a family of measurable {0, 1}-valued functions on \u03a9.)\nIn the learning model, a set P of probability measures on \u03a9 is fixed. Usually either\nP = P(\u03a9) is the set of all probability measures (distribution-free learning), or P = {\u03bc}\nis a single measure (learning under fixed distribution). In our article, the case of interest\nis the family P = Pna (\u03a9) of all non-atomic measures.\nEvery probability measure \u03bc on \u03a9 defines a distance d\u03bc on A as follows:\nd\u03bc (A, B) = \u03bc (A \u25b3 B) .\n\n\fWe will not distinguish between a measure \u03bc and its Lebesgue completion, that is,\nan extension of \u03bc over the larger sigma-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets of\n\u03a9. Consequently, we will sometimes use the term measurability meaning Lebesgue\nmeasurability. No confusion can arise here.\nOften it is convenient to approximate the concepts from C with elements of the hypothesis space, H , which is, technically, a subfamily of A whose closure with regard\nto each (pseudo)metric d\u03bc , \u03bc \u2208 P, contains C . However, in our article we make no\ndistinction between H and C .\nA learning sample is a pair s = (\u03c3, \u03c4) of finite subsets of \u03a9, where \u03c4 \u2286 \u03c3. It is\nconvenient to assume that elements x1 , x2 , . . . , xn \u2208 \u03c3 are ordered, and thus the set of\nall samples (\u03c3, \u03c4) with |\u03c3| = n can be identified with (\u03a9 \u00d7 {0, 1})n . A learning rule (for\nC ) is a mapping\n\u221e\n[\nL:\n\u03a9n \u00d7 {0, 1}n \u2192 C\nn=1\n\nwhich satisfies the following measurability condition: for every C \u2208 C and \u03bc \u2208 L, the\nfunction\n\u03a9 \u220b \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03bc (L(\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3) \u25b3 C) \u2208 R\n(1)\nis measurable.\nA learning rule L is consistent (with C ) if for every C \u2208 C and each \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n one\nhas\nL(\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3) \u2229 \u03c3 = C \u2229 \u03c3.\nA learning rule L is probably approximately correct (PAC) under P if for every \u01eb > 0\nsup sup \u03bc\u2297n {\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n : \u03bc (L(\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3) \u25b3 C) > \u01eb} \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bc\u2208P C\u2208C\n\nHere \u03bc\u2297n denotes the (Lebesgue extension of the) product measure on \u03a9n . Now the\norigin of the measurability condition (1) on the mapping L is clear: it is implicit in (2).\nEquivalently, there is a function s(\u01eb, \u03b4) (sample complexity of L) such that for each\nC \u2208 C and every \u03bc \u2208 P an i.i.d. sample \u03c3 with \u2265 s(\u01eb, \u03b4) points has the property\n\u03bc(C \u25b3 L(\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3)) < \u01eb with confidence \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nA concept class C consisting of measurable sets is PAC learnable under P, if there\nexists a PAC learning rule for C under P. A class C is consistently learnable (under\nP) if every learning rule consistent with C is PAC under P. If P = P(\u03a9) is the set\nof all probability measures, then C is said to be (distribution-free) PAC learnable. At\nthe same time, learnability under intermediate families of measures on \u03a9 has received\nconsiderable attention, cf. Chapter 7 in [V2].\nNotice that in this paper, we only talk of potential PAC learnability, adopting a\npurely information-theoretic viewpoint.\nA closely related concept is that of a uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli concept class with\nregard to a family of measures P, that is, a concept class C such that for each \u01eb > 0\n(\n)\n\u2297n\nsup |\u03bc(C) \u2212 \u03bcn (C)| \u2265 \u01eb \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n(3)\nsup \u03bc\n\u03bc\u2208P\n\nC\u2208C\n\n\f(Cf. [D], Ch. 3; [M].) Here \u03bcn stands for the empirical (uniform) measure on n points,\nsampled in an i.i.d. fashion from \u03a9 according to the distribution \u03bc. One also says that C\nhas the property of uniform convergence of empirical measures (UCEM property) with\nregard to P [V2].\nEvery uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli class (with regard to P) is PAC learnable (under\nP), and in the distribution-free situation, the converse is true as well. Already in the case\nof learning under a single measure, it is not so: a PAC learnable class under a single\ndistribution \u03bc need not be uniform Glivenko-Cantelli with regard to \u03bc (cf. Chapter 6 in\n[V2]). Not every PAC learnable class under non-atomic measures is uniform Glivenko\u2013\nCantelli with regard to non-atomic measures either: the class consisting of all finite and\nall cofinite subsets of \u03a9 is a counter-example.\nWe say, following Pollard [P], that a concept class C consisting of measurable sets\nis universally separable if it contains a countable subfamily C \u2032 with the property that\n\u2032\nevery C \u2208 C is a pointwise limit of a suitable sequence (Cn )\u221e\nn=1 of sets from C : for\nevery x \u2208 \u03a9 there is N with the property that, for all n \u2265 N, x \u2208 Cn if x \u2208 C, and x < Cn\nif x \u2208 C. Such a family C \u2032 is said to be universally dense in C .\nProbably the main source of uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli classes is the finiteness of\nVC dimension. Assume that C satisfies a suitable measurability condition, for instance,\nC is image admissible Souslin, or else universally separable. (In particular, a countable\nC satisfies either condition.) If VC(C ) = d < \u221e, then C is uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli,\nwith a sample complexity bound that does not depend on C , but only on \u01eb, \u03b4, and d.\nThe following is a typical (and far from being optimal) such estimate, which can be\ndeduced, for instance, along the lines of [M]:\n!\n!\n8\n2e\n2e2\n128\n+ log .\n(4)\nlog\ns(\u01eb, \u03b4, d) \u2264 2 d log\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u03b4\n\u01eb\nFor our purposes, we will fix any such bound and refer to it as a \"standard\" sample\ncomplexity estimate for s(\u01eb, \u03b4, d).\nA subset N \u2286 \u03a9 is universal null if for every non-atomic probability measure \u03bc on\n(\u03a9, A ) one has \u03bc(N \u2032 ) = 0 for some Borel set N \u2032 containing N. Universal null Borel sets\nare just countable sets.\n\n3 VC dimension and Boolean algebras\nRecall that a Boolean algebra, B = hB, \u2227, \u2228, \u00ac, 0, 1i, consists of a set, B, equipped with\ntwo associative and commutative binary operations, \u2227 (\"meet\") and \u2228 (\"join\"), which\nare distributive over each other and satisfy the absorption principles a \u2228 (a \u2227 b) = a,\na \u2227 (a \u2228 b) = a, as well as a unary operation \u00ac (complement), and two elements 0 and\n1, satisfying a \u2228 \u00aca = 1, a \u2227 \u00aca = 0.\nFor instance, the family 2\u03a9 of all subsets of a set \u03a9, with the union as join, intersection as meet, the empty set as 0 and \u03a9 as 1, as well as the set-theoretic complement\n\u00acA = Ac , forms a Boolean algebra. In fact, every Boolean algebra can be realized as\nan algebra of subsets of a suitable \u03a9. Even better, according to the Stone representation theorem, a Boolean algebra B is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra formed by all\n\n\fopen-and-closed subsets of a suitable compact space, S (B), called the Stone space of B,\nwhere the Boolean algebra operations are interpreted set-theoretically as above.\nThe space S (B) can be obtained in different ways. For instance, one can think\nof elements of S (B) as Boolean algebra homomorphisms from B to the two-element\nBoolean algebra {0, 1} (the algebra of subsets of a singleton). In this way, S (B) is a\nclosed topological subspace of the compact zero-dimensional space {0, 1}B with the\nusual Tychonoff product topology.\nThe Stone space of the Boolean algebra B = 2\u03a9 is known as the Stone-\u010cech compactification of \u03a9, and is denoted \u03b2\u03a9. The elements of \u03b2\u03a9 are ultrafilters on \u03a9. A\ncollection \u03be of non-empty subsets of \u03a9 is an ultrafilter if it is closed under finite intersections and if for every subset A \u2286 \u03a9 either A \u2208 \u03be or Ac \u2208 \u03be. To every point x \u2208 \u03a9\nthere corresponds a trivial (principal) ultrafilter, x\u0304, consisting of all sets A containing\nx. However, if \u03a9 is infinite, the Axiom of Choice assures that there exist non-principal\nultrafilters on \u03a9. Basic open sets in the space \u03b2\u03a9 are of the form \u0100 = {\u03b6 \u2208 \u03b2\u03a9 : A \u2208 \u03b6},\nwhere A \u2286 \u03a9. It is interesting to note that each \u0100 is at the same time closed, and in fact\n\u0100 is the closure of A in \u03b2\u03a9. Moreover, every open and closed subset of \u03b2\u03a9 is of the\nform \u0100.\nA one-to-one correspondence between ultrafilters on \u03a9 and Boolean algebra homomorphisms 2\u03a9 \u2192 {0, 1} is this: think of an ultrafilter \u03be on \u03a9 as its own indicator function\n\u03c7\u03be on 2\u03a9 , sending A \u2286 \u03a9 to 1 if and only if A \u2208 \u03be. It is not difficult to verify that \u03c7\u03be is a\nBoolean algebra homomorphism, and that every homomorphism arises in this way.\nThe book [Jo] is a standard reference to the above topics.\nGiven a subset C of a Boolean algebra B, and a subset X of the Stone space S (B),\none can regard C as a set of binary functions restricted to X, and compute the VC\ndimension of C over X. We will denote this parameter VC(C \u21be X).\nA subset I of a Boolean algebra B is an ideal if, whenever x, y \u2208 I and a \u2208 B,\none has x \u2228 y \u2208 I and a \u2227 x \u2208 I. Define a symmetric difference on B by the formula\nx \u25b3 y = (x \u2228 y) \u2228 \u00ac(x \u2227 y). The quotient Boolean algebra B/I consists of all equivalence\nclasses modulo the equivalence relation x \u223c y \u21d0\u21d2 x \u25b3 y \u2208 I. It can be easily verified\nto be a Boolean algebra on its own, with operations induced from B in a unique way.\nThe Stone space of B/I can be identified with a compact topological subspace of\nS (B), consisting of all homomorphisms B \u2192 {0, 1} whose kernel contains I. For instance, if B = 2\u03a9 and I is an ideal of subsets of \u03a9, then the Stone space of 2\u03a9 /I is easily\nseen to consist of all ultrafilters on \u03a9 which do not contain sets from I.\nTheorem 2. Let C be a concept class on a domain \u03a9, and let I be an ideal of sets on\n\u03a9. The following conditions are equivalent.\n1. The VC dimension of the (family of closures of the) concept class C restricted to\nthe Stone space of the quotient algebra 2\u03a9 /I is at least n: VC(C \u21be S (2\u03a9 /I)) \u2265 n.\n2. There exists a family A1 , A2 , . . . , An of measurable subsets of \u03a9 not belonging to I,\nwhich is shattered by C in the sense that if J \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , n}, then there is C \u2208 C\nwhich contains all sets Ai , i \u2208 J, and is disjoint from all sets Ai , i < J.\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2). Choose ultrafilters \u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben in the Stone space of the Boolean algebra\n2\u03a9 /I, whose collection is shattered by C . For every J \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , n}, select C J \u2208 C\n\n\fwhich carves the subset {\u03bei : i \u2208 J} out of {\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben }. This means C J \u2208 \u03bei if and only if\ni \u2208 J. For all i = 1, 2, . . . , n, set\n\\ \\\\\nAi =\nCJ\n(5)\nC cJ .\nJ\u220bi\n\nJ=i\n\nThen Ai \u2208 \u03bei and hence Ai < I. Furthermore, if i \u2208 J, then clearly Ai \u2286 C J , and if i < J,\nthen Ai \u2229 C J = \u2205. The sets Ai are measurable by their definition.\n(2)\u21d2(1). Let A1 , A2 , . . . , An be a family of subsets of \u03a9 not belonging to the set\nideal I and shattered by C in sense of the lemma. For every i, the family of sets of the\nform Ai \u2229 Bc , B \u2208 I is a filter and so is contained in some free ultrafilter \u03bei , which is\nclearly disjoint from I and contains Ai . If J \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , n} and C J \u2208 C contains all\nsets Ai , i \u2208 J and is disjoint from all sets Ai , i < J, then the closure C\u0304 J of C J in the\nStone space contains \u03bei if and only if i \u2208 J. We conclude: the collection of ultrafilters\n\u03bei , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, which are all contained in the Stone space of 2\u03a9 /I, is shattered by the\nclosed sets C\u0304 J .\nIt follows in particular that the VC dimension of a concept class does not change if\nthe domain \u03a9 is compactified.\nCorollary 1. VC(C \u21be \u03a9) = VC(C \u21be \u03b2\u03a9).\nProof. The inequality VC(C \u21be \u03a9) \u2264 VC(C \u21be \u03b2\u03a9) is trivial. To establish the converse,\nassume there is a subset of \u03b2\u03a9 of cardinality n shattered by C . Choose sets Ai as in\nTheorem 2,(2). Clearly, any subset of \u03a9 meeting each Ai at exactly one point is shattered\nby C .\nDefinition 1. Given a concept class C on a domain \u03a9 and an ideal I of subsets of \u03a9,\nwe define the VC dimension of C modulo I,\nVC(C mod I) = VC(C \u21be S (2\u03a9 /I)).\nThat is, VC(C mod I) \u2265 n if and only if any of the equivalent conditions of Theorem 2\nare met.\nDefinition 2. Let C be a concept class on a domain \u03a9. If I is the ideal of all countable subsets of \u03a9, we denote the VC(C mod I) by VC(C mod \u03c91 ) and call it the VC\ndimension modulo countable sets.\n\n4 Finiteness of VC dimension modulo countable sets is necessary\nfor learnability\nLemma 1. Every uncountable Borel subset of a standard Borel space supports a nonatomic Borel probability measure.\nProof. Let A be an uncountable Borel subset of a standard Borel space \u03a9, that is, \u03a9 is\na Polish space equipped with its Borel structure. According to Souslin's theorem (see\ne.g. Theorem 3.2.1 in [A]), there exists a Polish (complete separable metric) space X\n\n\fand a continuous one-to-one mapping f : X \u2192 A. The Polish space X must be therefore\nuncountable, and so supports a diffuse probability measure, \u03bd. The direct image measure\nf\u2217 \u03bd = \u03bd( f \u22121 (B)) on \u03a9 is a Borel probability measure supported on A, and it is diffuse\nbecause the inverse image of every singleton is a singleton in X and thus has measure\nzero.\nThe following result makes no measurability assumptions on the concept class.\nTheorem 3. Let C be a concept class on a domain (\u03a9, B) which is a standard Borel\nspace. If C is PAC learnable under non-atomic measures, then the VC dimension of C\nmodulo countable sets is finite.\nProof. This is just a minor variation of a classical result for distribution-free PAC learnability (Theorem 2.1(i) in [BEHW]; we will follow the proof as presented in [V2],\nLemma 7.2 on p. 279).\nSuppose VC(C mod \u03c91 ) \u2265 d. According to Theorem 2, there is a family of uncountable Borel sets Ai , i = 1, 2, . . . , d, shattered by C in our sense. Using Lemma 1, select\nfor every i = 1, 2, . . . , d a non-atomic probability measure \u03bci supported on Ai , and let\nP\n\u03bc = d1 di=1 \u03bci . This \u03bc is a non-atomic Borel probability measure, giving each Ai equal\nweight 1/d.\nFor every d-bit string \u03c3 there is a concept C\u03c3 \u2208 C which contains all Ai with \u03c3i = 1\nand is disjoint from Ai with \u03c3i = 0. If A and B take constant values on all the sets\nAi , i = 1, 2, . . . , d, then d\u03bc (A, B) is just the normalized Hamming distance between the\ncorresponding d-bit strings. Now, given A \u2208 C and 0 \u2264 k \u2264 d, there are\nX d!\nk\nk\u22642\u01ebd\nconcepts B with d\u03bc (A, B) \u2264 2\u01eb. This allows to get the following lower bound on the\nnumber of pairwise 2\u01eb-separated concepts:\n2d\n\n\u0010 \u0011.\n\nd\nk\u22642\u01ebd k\n\nP\n\nThe Chernoff\u2013Okamoto bound allows to estimate the above expression from below by\nexp[2(0.5 \u2212 2\u01eb)2 d]. We conclude: the metric entropy of C with regard to \u03bc is bounded\nbelow as:\nM(2\u01eb, C , \u03bc) \u2265 exp[2(0.5 \u2212 2\u01eb)2 d].\nThe assumption VC(C mod \u03c91 ) = \u221e now implies that for every 0 < \u01eb < 0.25,\nsup M(2\u01eb, C , \u03bc) = \u221e,\nP\u2208P\n\nwhere P denotes the family of all non-atomic measures on \u03a9. By Lemma 7.1 in [V2],\np. 278, the class C is not PAC learnable under P.\n\n\f5 The universally separable case\nLemma 2. Let C be a universally separable concept class, and let C \u2032 be a universally\ndense countable subset of C . Then\nVC(C ) = VC(C \u2032 ).\n\nProof. For every C \u2208 C there is a sequence (Cn ) of elements of C \u2032 with the property\nthat for each x \u2208 \u03a9 there is N such that if n \u2265 N and x \u2208 C, then x \u2208 Cn , and if x < C,\nthen x < Cn . Equivalently, for every finite A \u2286 \u03a9, there is an N so that whenever n \u2265 N,\none has Cn \u2229 A = C \u2229 A. This means that if A is shattered by C , it is equally well\nshattered by C \u2032 . This established the inequaity VC(C ) \u2264 VC(C \u2032 ), while the converse\ninequality is obviously true.\nTheorem 4. For a universally separable concept class C , the following conditions are\nequivalent.\n1. VC(C mod \u03c91 ) \u2264 d.\n2. There exists a countable subset A \u2286 \u03a9 such that VC(C \u21be (\u03a9 \\ A)) \u2264 d.\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): Choose a countable universally dense subfamily C \u2032 of C . Let B be the\nsmallest Boolean algebra of subsets of \u03a9 containing C \u2032 . Denote by A the union of all\nelements of B that are countable sets. Clearly, B is countable, and so A is a countable\nset.\nLet a finite set B \u2286 \u03a9 \\ A be shattered by C . Then, by Lemma 2, it is shattered by\nC \u2032 . Select a family S of 2|B| sets in C \u2032 shattering B. For every b \u2208 B the set\n\\\n\\ \\\n[b] =\nC\nCc\nb\u2208C\u2208S\n\nb<C\u2208S\n\nis uncountable (for it belongs to B yet is not contained in A), and the collection of\nsets [b], b \u2208 B is shattered by C \u2032 . This establishes the inequality VC(C \u21be (\u03a9 \\ A)) \u2264\nVC(C mod \u03c91 ).\n(2)\u21d2(1): Fix an A \u2286 \u03a9 so that VC(C mod Ac ) \u2264 d. Suppose a collection of n\nuncountable sets Ai , i = 1, 2, . . . , n is shattered by C in our sense. The sets Ai \\ A are\nnon-empty; pick a representative ai \u2208 Ai \\ A, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. The resulting set {ai }ni=1 is\nshattered by C , meaning n \u2264 d.\nCorollary 2. Let C be a universally separable concept class on a Borel domain \u03a9. If\nd = VC(C mod \u03c91 ) < \u221e, then C is a universal Glivenko-Cantelli class with regard to\nnon-atomic measures and consistently PAC learnable under non-atomic measures.\nProof. The class C has finite VC dimension in the complement to a suitable countable\nsubset A of \u03a9, hence C is a universal Glivenko-Cantelli class (in the classical sense) in\nthe standard Borel space \u03a9 \\ A. But A is a universal null set in \u03a9, hence clearly C is\nuniversal Glivenko-Cantelli with regard to non-atomic measures.\n\n\fThe class C is distribution-free consistently PAC learnable in the domain \u03a9 \\ A,\nwith the standard sample complexity s(\u01eb, \u03b4, d). Let L be any consistent learning rule for\nn\nn\nC in \u03a9. The restriction of L to \u03a9 \\ A (more exactly, to \u222a\u221e\nn=1 ((\u03a9 \\ A) \u00d7 {0, 1} )) is a\nconsistent learning rule for C restricted to the standard Borel space \u03a9 \\ A, and together\nwith the fact that A has measure zero with regard to any non-atomic measure, it implies\nthat L is a PAC learning rule for C under non-atomic measures, with the same sample\ncomplexity function s(\u01eb, \u03b4, d).\n\n6 Martin's Axiom and learnability\nMartin's Axiom (MA) in one of its equivalent forms says that no compact Hausdorff\ntopological space with the countable chain condition is a union of strictly less than continuum nowhere dense subsets. Thus, it can be seen as a strengthening of the statement\nof the Baire Category Theorem. In particular, the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) implies\nMA. However, MA is compatible with the negation of CH, and this is where the most\ninteresting applications of MA are to be found. We will be using just one particular\nconsequence of MA.\nTheorem 5 (Martin-Solovay). Let (\u03a9, \u03bc) be a standard Lebesgue non-atomic probability space. Under MA, the Lebesgue measure is 2\u05d00 -additive, that is, if \u03ba < 2\u05d00 and\nA\u03b1 , \u03b1 < \u03ba is family of pairwise disjoint measurable sets, then \u222a\u03b1<\u03ba A\u03b1 is Lebesgue measurable and\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec[ \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 X\n\u03bc \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed A\u03b1 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 =\n\u03bc(A\u03b1 ).\n\u03b1<\u03ba\n\n\u03b1<\u03ba\n\nIn particular, the union of less than continuum null subsets of \u03a9 is a null subset.\n\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\nFor the proof and more on MA, see [K], Theorem 2.21, or [F], or [Je], pp. 563\u2013565.\nLemma 3. Let C be an infinite concept class on a measurable space \u03a9. Denote \u03ba = |C |\nthe cardinality of C . There exists a consistent learning rule L for C with the property\nthat for every C \u2208 C and each n, the set\n{L(\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3) : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n } \u2286 C\nhas cardinality < \u03ba. Under MA the rule L satisfies the measurability condition (1).\nProof. Choose a minimal well-ordering of elements of C :\nC = {C\u03b1 : \u03b1 < \u03ba},\nand set for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n and \u03c4 \u2208 {0, 1}n the value L(\u03c3, \u03c4) equal to C\u03b2 , where\n\u03b2 = min{\u03b1 < \u03ba : C\u03b1 \u2229 \u03c3 = \u03c4},\nprovided such a \u03b2 exists. Clearly, for each \u03b1 < \u03ba one has\nL(\u03c3, C\u03b1 \u2229 \u03c3) \u2286 {C\u03b2 : \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1},\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhich assures (6). Besides, the learning rule L is consistent.\nFix C = C\u03b1 \u2208 C , \u03b1 < \u03ba. For every \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1 define D\u03b2 = {\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n : C \u2229 \u03c3 = C\u03b2 \u2229 \u03c3}.\nThe sets D\u03b2 are measurable, and the function\n\u03a9n \u220b \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03bc(L(C \u2229 \u03c3) \u25b3 C) \u2208 R\ntakes a constant value \u03bc(C\u03b2 \u25b3 C\u03b1 ) on each set D\u03b2 \\ \u222a\u03b3<\u03b2 D\u03b3 , \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1. Such sets, as well\nas all their possible unions, are measurable under MA by force of Martin\u2013Solovay's\nTheorem 5, and their union is \u03a9n . This implies the condition (1) for L.\nWe again recall that a set A \u2286 \u03a9 is absolutely null if it is Lebesgue measurable with\nregard to every non-atomic Borel probability measure \u03bc on \u03a9 and \u03bc(A) = 0.\nLemma 4 (Assuming MA). Let C be a class of Borel subsets on a standard Borel\nspace \u03a9. Suppose there is a natural d such that every countable subclass C \u2032 \u2286 C has\nVC dimension \u2264 d outside of an absolutely null set (which depends on C ). Then every\nsubclass of C of cardinality < 2\u05d00 has the same property.\nProof. By induction on the cardinality of C , which we denote \u03b1 (notice that it never\nexceeds 2\u05d00 , and so the proof only makes sense under the negation of the Continuum\nHypothesis). Suppose the result is true for all \u03b2, \u05d00 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03b1. Choose a minimally\nwell-ordered chain C\u03b3 , \u03b3 < \u03b1 of subclasses of C whose union is C . For every \u03b3, let\nN\u03b3 be a universal null subset of \u03a9 with the property that C\u03b3 has VC dimension \u2264 d\noutside of N\u03b3 . Martin\u2013Sollovay's Theorem implies that N = \u222a\u03b3<\u03b1 N\u03b3 is absolutely\nnull. Consequently, each C\u03b3 has VC dimension \u2264 d outside of N, and the same applies\nto the union of the chain.\nLemma 5 (Assuming MA). Let C be a concept class of cardinality \u03ba = |C | < 2\u05d00 on a\nstandard Borel space \u03a9. If d = VC(C ) is finite, then C is a uniform Glivenko\u2013Cantelli\nclass, with a standard sample complexity estimate s(\u01eb, \u03b4, d).\nProof. A transfinite induction on \u03ba. For \u03ba = \u05d00 the result is classical.

Under the assumptions of Lemma 4, every subclass of\nC of cardinality < 2\u05d00 is uniform Glivenko-Cantelli with regard to the family of nonatomic measures on \u03a9. The sample complexity of this class is the usual sample complexity s(\u03b4, \u01eb, d) of concept classes of VC dimension \u2264 d.\nLemma 7 (Assuming MA). Let C be a concept class consisting of Borel subsets of a\nstandard Borel space \u03a9. Assume that for some natural d, every countable subclass of C\nhas VC dimension \u2264 d outside of some universal null subset of \u03a9. Then the class C is\nPAC learnable under the family of all non-atomic measures on \u03a9, with the usual sample\ncomplexity s(\u03b4, \u01eb) of distribution-free PAC learning concept classes of VC dimension\n\u2264 d.\nProof. Using Lemma 3, choose a learning rule L for C with the property in Eq. (6).\nSince the family of all Borel subsets of \u03a9 is well-known to have cardinality continuum,\nfor every concept C and each n the cardinality of the image LC = L{C \u2229 \u03c3 : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n } \u2286\nC is strictly less than 2\u05d00 . By Lemma 6, LC is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class with\nregard to non-atomic measures on \u03a9, satisfying the standard sample complexity bound.\nThe proof is now concluded in a standard way.\n\n7 The proof of the main theorem\n(1)\u21d2(2): this is Theorem 3.\n(2)\u21d2(3): follows from Theorem 4.\n(3)\u21d2(4): assume that for every d there is a countable subclass Cd of C with the property\nthat the VC dimension of Cd is \u2265 d after removing any countable subset of \u03a9. Clearly,\nthe countable class \u222a\u221e\nd=1 Cd will have infinite VC dimension outside of every countable\nsubset of \u03a9, a contradiction.\n(4)\u21d2(6): as a consequence of a classical result of Vapnik and Chervonenkis, every\ncountable subclass C \u2032 is universal Glivenko-Cantelli with regard to all probability measures supported outside of some countable subset of \u03a9, and a standard bound for the\nsample complexity s(\u03b4, \u01eb) only depends on d, from which the statement follows.\n(6)\u21d2(5): trivial.\n(5)\u21d2(3): modelling the classical argument that the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property\nimplies finite VC dimension, in exactly the same spirit as in the proof of our Theorem\n3, one shows that the uniform Glivenko-Cantelli property of a concept class with regard to non-atomic measures implies a finite VC dimension modulo countable sets. But\nfor a countable (more generally, universally separable) class C \u2032 this means finite VC\ndimension after a removal of a countable set, cf. Theorem 4.\n(3)\u21d2(1): this is Lemma 7, and the only implication requiring Martin's Axiom.\nThe equivalence of (1), (7) and (8) in the universally separable case follows from\nTheorem 4 and Corollary 2.\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\n\f8 Conclusion\nWe have characterized concept classes C that are distribution-free PAC learnable under the family of all non-atomic probability measures on the domain. The criterion is\nobtained without any measurability conditions on the concept class, but at the expense\nof making a set-theoretic assumption in the form of Martin's Axiom. In fact, assuming\nMA makes things easier, and as this axiom is very natural, perhaps it deserves its small\ncorner within the foundations of statistical learning.\nIt seems that generalizing the result from concept to function classes, using a version\nof the fat shattering dimension modulo countable sets, will not pose particular technical\ndifficulties, and we plan to perform this extension in a full journal version of the paper,\nin order to keep the conference submission short. The Boolean algebras will however\nhave to give way to commutative C \u2217 -algebras [A].\nIt would be still interesting to know if the present results hold without Martin's\nAxiom, under the assumption that the concept class C is image admissible Souslin\n([D], pages 186\u2013187). The difficulty here is selecting a measurable learning rule L with\nthe property that the images of all learning samples (\u03c3, C \u2229 \u03c3), \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a9n , are uniform\nGlivenko-Cantelli. An obvious route to pursue is the recursion on the Borel rank of C ,\nbut we were unable to follow it through.\nNow, a concept class C will be learnable under diffuse measures provided there is\na hypothesis class H which has finite VC dimension and such that every C \u2208 C differs\nfrom a suitable H \u2208 H by a null set. If C consists of all finite and all cofinite subsets\nof \u03a9, this H is given by {\u2205, \u03a9}. One may conjecture that C is learnable under diffuse\nmeasures if and only if it admits such a \"core\" H having finite VC dimension. Is this\ntrue?\nAnother natural question is: can one characterize concept classes that are uniformly\nGlivenko\u2013Cantelli with regard to all non-atomic measures? Apparently, this task requires yet another version of shattering dimension, which is strictly intermediate between Talagrand's \"witness of irregularity\" [T] and our VC dimension modulo countable sets. We do not have a viable candidate.\nFinally, our investigation open up a possibility of linking learnability and VC dimension to Boolean algebras and their Stone spaces. This could be a glib exercise in\ngeneralization for its own sake, or maybe something deeper if one manages to invoke\nmodel theory and forcing.\n\nReferences\nArveson, F.
