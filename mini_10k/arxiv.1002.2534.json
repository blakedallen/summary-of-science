We have used integral field spectroscopy with adaptative optics at the\nGemini North Telescope to map the to map the age distribution of the stellar population in the inner 300 pc at\na spatial resolution of 35 pc. An old stellar population component (age &5 Gyr) is dominant within the inner\n\u2248 160 pc, which we attribute to the galaxy bulge. Beyond this region, up to the borders of the observation\nfield (\u223c 300 pc), intermediate age components (0.3\u20130.7 Gyr) dominate. We find a spatial correlation between\nthis intermediate age component and a partial ring of low stellar velocity dispersions (\u03c3\u2217 ). Low-\u03c3\u2217 nuclear\nrings have been observed in other active galaxies and our result for Mrk 1066 suggests that they are formed\nby intermediate age stars. This age is consistent with an origin for the low-\u03c3\u2217 rings in a past event which\ntriggered an inflow of gas and formed stars which still keep the colder kinematics (as compared to that of the\nbulge) of the gas from which they have formed. At the nucleus proper we detect, in addition, two unresolved\ncomponents: a compact infrared source, consistent with an origin in hot dust with mass \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 , and\na blue featureless power-law continuum, which contributes with only \u224815% of the flux at 2.12 \u03bcm.\nSubject headings: galaxies: individual (Mrk 1066) - galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: Seyfert - galaxies: stellar\ncontent - infrared: galaxies\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOptical spectroscopy on scales of hundreds of parsecs\naround the nucleus of Seyfert galaxies have shown that\nin \u2248 40 % of them the active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nand young stars co-exist (e.g. Storchi-Bergmann et al.\n2000,\n2001;\nGonz\u00e1lez Delgado, Heckman & Leitherer\n2001; Cid Fernandes et al. 2004; Asari et al. 2007;\nDors et al. 2008), providing support to the so-called\nAGN-Starburst connection (e.g. Norman & Scoville 1988;\nTerlevich, Diaz & Terlevich 1990; Heckman et al. 1997;\nHeckman 2004; Riffel et al. 2009a). In particular, these\nauthors have pointed out that the main difference between\nthe stellar population (hereafter SP) of active and non-active\ngalaxies is an excess of mainly intermediate age stars in the\nformer.\nA similar result has been found in recent SP studies in\nthe near-infrared (hereafter near-IR), using the technique\nof spectral synthesis (Riffel et al. 2009b, 2007). Using\nintegrated spectra of the central few hundreds of parsecs\nin a sample of 24 Seyfert galaxies, these authors have\nshown that the continuum is dominated by the contribution of intermediate-age stellar population components\n(SPCs). In addition, they found that the near-IR nuclear spectra of about 50 % of the Seyfert 1 and \u223c20 %\nof the Seyfert 2 galaxies show emission from hot dust\n(Riffel et al. 2009b; Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & McGregor\n2009; Riffel et al. 2009a; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila & Mazzalay\n2006; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila, Contini & Viegas 2005a).\nUsing a somewhat distinct technique, Davies et al. (2007)\nobtained near-IR integral field spectroscopy to investigate the\ncircumnuclear star formation in 9 nearby Seyfert galaxies at\nspatial resolutions of tens of parsecs. They have modelled\nthe Br\u03b3 equivalent width, supernova rate and mass-to-light\nratio to quantify the star formation history in the center of\nElectronic address: rogemar@smail.ufsm.br\n\nthese galaxies using their code stars. They found that the\nages of the stars which contribute most to the near-IR continuum lie in the range 10\u201330 Myr, but point out that these ages\nshould be considered only as \"characteristic\", as they have\nnot performed a proper spectral synthesis, arguing that there\nmay be simultaneously two or more SPs that are not coeval\n(Davies et al. 2007, 2006).\nIn this paper we present, for the first time, two-dimensional\n(hereafter 2D) SP synthesis in the near-IR for the inner hundreds of pc of an active galaxy \u2013 namely Mrk 1066 \u2013 using integral field spectroscopy with adaptive optics, which allowed\nus to derive the contribution of distinct SPCs to the near-IR\nspectra and map their spatial distributions. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we describe the observations,\ndata reduction procedures and the spectral synthesis method;\nin Sec. 3 we present our results, which are discussed in Sec. 4.\nThe conclusions are presented in Sec. 5.\n2. THE DATA AND SYNTHESIS CODE\n2.1. Mrk 1066\n\nMrk 1066 is an SB0 galaxy harboring a Seyfert 2 nucleus and located at a distance of 48.6 Mpc, for which\n1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 235 pc at the galaxy. Previous studies of the central region of Mrk 1066 have shown that\nline emission from high-excitation gas is dominated by\ngas in a bi-conical outflow oriented along position angle\nPA=135/315\u25e6, which seems to be associated to the radio\njet, while the low-excitation gas is more restricted to the\nplane of the galaxy (Bower et al. 1995; Nagar et al. 1999;\nKnop et al. 2001; Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar 2010;\nRiffel & Storchi-Bergmann 2010). We selected this galaxy\nfor the present study because it shows a signature of the presence of young/intermediate age stellar population in its stellar\nkinematics in the inner few hundred parsecs as illustrated in\nthe stellar velocity dispersion (\u03c3\u2217 ) map shown in the top-left\npanel of Fig. 2. This map was obtained from the fit of the\n\n\f2\n\nRogemar A. Riffel et al.\n\nCO band heads around 2.3 \u03bcm by a combination of stellar\nspectral templates from Winge, Riffel & Storchi-Bergmann\n(2009) using the penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF) method of\nCappellari & Emsellem (2004). It shows a partial ring of low\n\u03c3\u2217 , a signature of the presence of stars which still have the\nkinematics of the cold gas from which they have formed1.\nOur first goal with the spectral synthesis is to derive the\nage of this population. Additionally, high spatial resolution\nspectroscopy has shown that the near-IR nuclear continuum\nis consistent with a large contribution from hot dust emission (Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar 2010), not detected\nin lower resolution observations (Riffel et al. 2009b). Our\nsecond goal is to quantify this contribution with spectral synthesis.\n2.2. Observations and data reduction\nMrk 1066 was observed with the Gemini Near-Infrared\nIntegral-Field Spectrograph (NIFS; McGregor et al. 2003)\noperating with Gemini North Adaptive Optics system ALTAIR in September 2008 under the programme GN-2008BQ-30. Two set of observations were obtained, one at the J\nband, covering a spectral region from 1.15 \u03bcm to 1.36 \u03bcm with\na two-pixel spectral resolving power of 6040; and another at\nthe Kl band at resolving power of 5290 and covering the spectral range 2.1\u20132.5 \u03bcm.\nThe\ndata\nreduction,\ndescribed\nin\nRiffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar (2010), was performed\nusing the gemini iraf package and followed standard procedures. The resulting calibrated data cube contains 784\nspectra covering a angular region of 2.\u2032\u2032 8\u00d72.\u2032\u2032 8 at a sampling of 0.\u2032\u2032 1\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 1, which corresponds to 650\u00d7650 pc2 and\n23.5\u00d723.5 pc2 , respectively. The angular resolution is \u22480.\u2032\u2032 15,\ncorresponding to 35 pc at the galaxy.\n2.3. Analysis\n\nIn order to model the continuum and stellar absorption features we used the starlight spectral synthesis code\n(Cid Fernandes et al. 2004, 2005, 2009; Mateus et al. 2006;\nAsari et al. 2007). According to the authors starlight mixes\ncomputational techniques originally developed for semi empirical population synthesis with ingredients from evolutionary synthesis models.\nIn summary, the code fits an observed spectum O\u03bb with a\ncombination, in different proportions, of N\u2217 single stellar populations (SSPs). Following Riffel et al. (2009b) we use the\nMaraston (2005) Evolutionary Population Synthesis (EPS)\nmodels as base set (described below). This choice is due to\nthe fact that Maraston's models include the effects of stars\nin the TP-AGB phase, wich is crucial to model NIR SP (see\nRiffel, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila & Pastoriza 2006; Riffel et al. 2007,\n2008b, 2009b). Extinction is modeled by starlight as due to\nforeground dust, and parameterized by the V-band extinction\nAV (Cid Fernandes et al. 2004, 2005). Note that all the components are reddened by the same ammount. We use the CCM\n(Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis 1989) extinction law.\nBasically, the code solves the following equation for a\nmodel spectrum M\u03bb (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005):\n\uf8eeN\n\uf8f9\n\u2217\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8efX\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n(1)\nM\u03bb = M\u03bb0 \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ef\nx j b j,\u03bb r\u03bb \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8fa \u2297 G(v\u2217 , \u03c3\u2217 )\nj=1\n\n1\n\nA detailed discussion of the stellar kinematics is presented in\nRiffel & Storchi-Bergmann (2010).\n\nwere b j,\u03bb r\u03bb is the reddened spectrum of the jth SSP normalized at \u03bb0 ; r\u03bb = 10\u22120.4(A\u03bb \u2212A\u03bb0 ) is the reddening term; M\u03bb0 is\nthe synthetic flux at the normalisation wavelength; ~x is the\npopulation vector; \u2297 denotes the convolution operator and\nG(v\u2217 , \u03c3\u2217 ) is the gaussian distribution used to model the lineof-sight stellar motions, it is centred at velocity v\u2217 with dispersion \u03c3\u2217 .\nThe final fit is carried out with a simulated annealing plus\nMetropolis scheme, which searches for the minimum of the\nequation (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005):\nX\n\u03c72 =\n[(O\u03bb \u2212 M\u03bb )w\u03bb ]2\n(2)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere emission lines and spurious features are masked out by\nfixing w\u03bb =0.\nThe spectral base was constructed with EPS models of\nMaraston (2005) as in Riffel et al. (2009b), and comprise single stellar populations (SSPs) synthetic spectra covering 12\nages (t =0.01,0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 2, 5, 9 and\n13 Gyr) and four metallicities (Z =0.02, 0.5, 1, 2 Z\u2299 ). We\nalso included blackbody functions for temperatures in the\nrange 700-1400 K in steps of 100 K (Riffel et al. 2009b) and a\npower-law (F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u22121.5 ) in order to account for possible contributions from dust emission and from a featureless continuum (FC), respectively, in regions close to the nucleus (e.g.\nCid Fernandes et al. 2004).\n3. RESULTS\n\nIn Fig. 1 we present the results of the synthesis for two spectra extracted within an aperture of 0.\u2032\u2032 1\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 1, one at the nucleus\n(top panel) and the other at 1\u2032\u2032 south-east of it (bottom panel).\nThe observed (black) and synthetic (red) spectra were normalized to unit at 2.12 \u03bcm. This wavelength was chosen because\nthe K-band spectra present a higher signal-to-noise ratio than\nthose in the J-band and the spectral region near 2.12 \u03bcm is free\nof emission/absorption lines (Riffel et al. 2008b). In the inner\n0.\u2032\u2032 2 (45 pc) radius the contribution from a FC and from dust\nemission are important, as illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 1,\nwhere the combined contribution of all SPCs is shown in blue,\nthe FC as a dotted line and the composite blackbody function\n(sum over all temperatures) as a dashed line. We point out that\nthe syntetic spectra (sum of all components) was reddened by\nthe reddening amount detected in the observed spectra.\nFollowing Cid Fernandes et al. (2004), we have binned the\ncontribution of the SPCs (x j ) to the flux at 2.2\u03bcm into four\nage (t) ranges: young (xy : t \u2264 100 Myr); young-intermediate\n(xyi : 0.3 \u2264 t \u2264 0.7 Gyr), intermediate-old (xio : 1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 Gyr)\nand old (xo : 5 \u2264 t \u2264 13 Gyr). The percent flux contribution at\n2.12 \u03bcm from stars of each age range are shown in Fig. 2: on\naverage, the young-intermediate SPCs dominate the continuum emission from the central region of Mrk 1066, but there\nis significant variation over the NIFS field. While in regions\nfarther than r \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 7 \u2013 160 pc from the nucleus \u2013 the contribution of the young-intermediate age stars reaches values of\nup to 100 %, closer to the nucleus its contribution is negligible. Within this region the stellar population is dominated by\nthe old component, whose contribution reaches \u2248 50 %, followed by the young component, whose contribution reaches\n\u224830 % of the flux at 2.12 \u03bcm. Also within this region, but unresolved by our observations (thus within 0.\u2032\u2032 15 from the nucleus) we find a contribution of up to 50% from the combined\nblackbody components. Finally, we have found a small contribution from the AGN FC component, which reaches at most\n\n\fIntemediate age stars and low-\u03c3\u2217 ring in Mrk 1066\n1.5\n\n3\n\nNucleus\nE(B-V)=1.1 mag\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nE(B-V)=0.1 mag\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1.5\n\nFig. 1.- Sample fits of the SPCs to the nuclear spectrum (top) and to an extra-nuclear one at 1.\u2032\u2032 0 south-east of the nucleus (bottom).

The\nintermediate-old component contributes with less than 20 %\nat most locations, with larger values more concentrated to the\nwest-northwest of the nucleus.\nBesides the SPC distributions, the synthesis outputs the\naverage reddening of the stellar populations, shown in the\ncentral panel of Fig. 3. It reaches the highest values, of\nup to E(B \u2212 V) = 1.4, along the position angle 128\u25e6,\nwhich is the orientation of the line of nodes of the galaxy\n(Riffel & Storchi-Bergmann 2010).\nThe robustness of the SP fit can be measured by the\npercent mean deviation (adev), |O\u03bb \u2212 M\u03bb |/O\u03bb , where O\u03bb\nis the observed spectrum and M\u03bb is the fitted model\n(Cid Fernandes et al. 2004, 2005). The resulting adev map\nis shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 and presents values\nadev . 2.5 % at most locations, indicating that the model\nreproduces very well the observed spectra. Nevertheless, at\nregions close to the border of the NIFS field the adev reaches\nvalues of up to 5%. At these locations we found an increase\nin the contribution of the young component xy , which has\nthus larger uncertainties than in the rest of the NIFS field and\nshould be further investigated with better data.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nIn general, our results are in good agreement\nwith those of previous near-IR studies for single aperture nuclear spectra (Riffel et al. 2009b;\nRamos Almeida, P\u00e9rez Garc\u0131\u0301a & Acosta-Pulido\n2009).\nThe main novelty of our work is the 2D mapping of the\nstellar population using near-IR spectra, which shows spatial\nvariations in the contribution of the SPCs in the inner few\nhundred parsecs of Mrk 1066.\nThe significance of the above variations is further enhanced\nby the comparison with the \u03c3\u2217 map presented in the top-left\npanel of Fig. 2. This map shows a partial ring of low \u03c3\u2217\nvalues (\u2248 50 km s\u22121) surrounding the nuclear region (which\nhas \u03c3\u2217 \u2248 100 km s\u22121) at \u2248 1\u2032\u2032 from it. Such rings are\n\ncommonly observed in the central region of active galaxies (Barbosa et al. 2006; Deo, Crenshaw & Kraemer 2006;\nSim\u00f5es Lopes et al. 2007; Riffel et al. 2008a, 2009a) and interpreted as being due to colder regions with more recent\nstar formation than the underlying bulge. The comparison of\nthe results from the SP synthesis of Mrk 1066 with the \u03c3\u2217\nmap shows that the low \u03c3\u2217 -values ring is associated with the\nyoung-intermediate age SPC, while the highest \u03c3\u2217 values are\nassociated with the old SPC, supporting the use of low stellar\nvelocity dispersion as a tracer of younger stars in the bulge\nand confirming the interpretation of the above studies.\nThe flux-weighted SPC contributions depend on the normalization point and thus the comparison with results from\nother spectral regions should be done with caution. A physical parameter which does not depend on the normalization point and spectral range used in the synthesis is the\nmass of the stars. Thus, we constructed maps for the massweighted contribution of each SPC. The contributions for the\nyoung population (my ), young-intermediate population (myi ),\nintermediate-old population (mio ) and old population (mo ),\nare shown in the rightmost panel of second row, bottom-left,\nbottom-central and bottom-right panels of Fig. 2, respectively.\nThe mass-weighted contribution of the young population is\nvery small over the whole field, while mo dominates within\n\u2248160 pc from the nucleus and myi dominates in the circumnuclear ring.\nThe only previous 2D stellar population studies of active\ngalaxies in the near-IR published to date are those from the\ngroup of R. I. Davies. In particular, Davies et al. (2007) investigated the circumnuclear star formation in nine Seyfert galaxies using near-IR IFU observations and also found circumnuclear disks of typical diameters of tens of pc with a \"characteristic\" age in the range 10\u2013300 Myr based on measurementes of the Br\u03b3 emission-line equivalent width, supernova\nrate and mass-to-light ratio. Thus, the results we have found\nfor Mrk 1066 are in reasonable agreement with those found by\nDavies group. Nevertheless, the methodology adopted in the\n\n\f4\n\nRogemar A. Riffel et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Stellar velocity dispersion map (top-left panel) and spatial distributions of the percent contribution of each SPC to the flux at \u03bb = 2.12 \u03bcm (x j ) and to\nthe mass (m j ), where j represents the age of the SPC: young (y: \u2264 100 Myr), young-intermediate (yi: 0.3\u20130.7 Gyr), intermediate-old (io: 1\u20132 Gyr) and old (o:\n5\u201313 Gyr).\n\nFig. 3.- From left to right: Spatial distribution of the dust emission summed over all temperatures, reddening map and adev map (percent mean deviation from\nthe spectral fit).\n\n\fIntemediate age stars and low-\u03c3\u2217 ring in Mrk 1066\npresent work allowed us not only to obtain a \"characteristic\"\nage, but to also map, for the first time, the spatial distribution of stars of different ages in the central region of a Seyfert\ngalaxy, on the basis of near-IR integral-field spectroscopy.\nAs presented in Sec. 2.3 our spectral base include four\ndistinc metalicities: Z =0.02, 0.5, 1, 2 Z\u2299 . Following\nCid Fernandes et al. (2004), we can estimate the mean flux\nand mass-weighted metalicity in the fit by\n< Z\u2217 >L =\n\nN\u2217\nX\n\nx jZ j\n\n(3)\n\nm jZ j,\n\n(4)\n\nj=1\n\nand\n< Z\u2217 > M =\n\nN\u2217\nX\nj=1\n\nwhere < Z\u2217 >L is the flux-weighted mean metalicity, < Z\u2217 > M\nis the mass-weighted mean metalicity and N\u2217 is the number of SSP in the spectral base. In the case of Mrk 1066\nwe obtain a nearly solar metalicity \u2013 < Z\u2217 >L = 0.021 and\n< Z\u2217 > M = 0.017 \u2013 in good agreement with those found by\nRiffel et al. (2009b) from near-IR spectral synthesis using a\nsingle aperture nuclear spectrum.\nIn further support of the results of the synthesis, we found\nthat the average reddening map derived for the stellar population (central panel of Fig. 3) is in close agreement to the one\nderived for the narrow-line region using emission-line ratios\n(Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar 2010), presenting a similar S-shaped structure.\nThe synthesis also confirmed the presence of an unresolved\nblackbody (BB) component at the nucleus, which we had\nfound in Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar (2010) from the\nfit of the nuclear spectrum by a BB function plus a power-law.\nOn the basis of its luminosity, we have followed the calculations as in Riffel et al. (2009b) to estimate a total dust mass of\nMHD \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 , which is in good agreement with the\nvalue obtained in Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar (2010)\nand with those observed for other Seyfert galaxies (e.g.\nRiffel et al. 2009a; Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & McGregor\n2009; Riffel et al. 2009b; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila & Mazzalay\n2006; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Ardila, Contini & Viegas 2005a).\nAs discussed in Sec. 3, we found that the FC component contributes with \u223c 15 % of the 2.12 \u03bcm nuclear\ncontinuum, which is in good agreement with the result\nfound by Riffel et al. (2009b). This contribution is nevertheless uncertain, as it is hard to distinguish a reddened\nyoung starburst (t . 5 Myr) from an AGN FC component (e.g. Storchi-Bergmann et al. 2000; Cid Fernandes et al.\n2004; Riffel et al. 2009b). On the other hand, the contribution of the young population xy is dominated by\nstars with ages of 50\u2013100 Myr, thus there does not seem\nto be a significant contribution from very young stellar populations, suggesting that the FC component originates from the emission of the AGN. This interpretation is supported by the detection of weak broad components for the Pa\u03b2 and Br\u03b3 emission lines for the nuclear spectra of Mrk 1066 (Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar\n2010; Veilleux,Goodrich & Hill 1997). However, spectropolarimetric studies, show no evidence for the hidden Seyfert\n1 nucleus in Mrk 1066 (e.g. Bian & Gu 2007). Thus, the origin of the FC in Mrk 1066 must be further investigated.\nWe finally point out one caveat of the stellar population synthesis in the near-IR. In Riffel, Storchi-Bergmann & Nagar\n\n5\n\n(2010), on the basis of emission-line ratios, we have identified a large star-forming region at 0.\u2032\u2032 5 south-east of the\nnucleus. In order to be active, this region should have an\nage .10 Myr (Riffel et al. 2009a; Dors et al. 2008; D\u0131\u0301az et al.\n2007; Kennicutt et al. 1989). Nevertheless, our synthesis did\nnot find a young stellar component at this location, indicating that spectral synthesis in the near-IR (at least in the J and\nK bands) is not a good tracer of very recent star formation\n(age \u2264 10 Myr). This result is expected since the young (blue)\npopulation has its peak emission in ultraviolet/optical wavelengths, while in the near-IR its contribution to the flux is very\nsmall, being hard to detect this component in this wavelength\nregion.\nIn order to have a complete census of the stellar population\ncomponents it is thus essential to study the stellar content of\nthe central region of active galaxies using distinct methods\nand spectral regions.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe present work reports for the first time spectral synthesis in the near-IR with 2D coverage for the nuclear region of a\nSeyfert galaxy (Mrk 1066) within the inner \u2248 300 pc at a spatial resolution of \u2248 35 pc. We have mapped the distribution\nof stellar population components of different ages and of their\naverage reddening. The main conclusions of this work are:\n\u2022 The age of the dominant stellar population presents\nspatial variations: the flux and mass contributions\nwithin the inner \u2248 160 pc are dominated by old stars\n(t \u22655 Gyr), while intermediate age stars (0.3 \u2264 t \u2264\n0.7 Gyr) dominate in the circumnuclear region;\n\u2022 There is a spatial correlation between the distribution of\nthe intermediate age component and low stellar velocity\ndispersion values which delineate a partial ring around\nthe nucleus. Similar structures have been found around\nother active nuclei, and our result for Mrk 1066 suggests that these nuclear rings (and in some cases disks)\nare formed by intermediate age stars.\n\u2022 There is an unresolved dusty structure at the nucleus\nwith mass MHD \u2248 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 M\u2299 , which may be the\nhottest part of the dusty torus postulated by the unified\nmodel of AGN and a small contribution from a powerlaw continuum (\u224815 % of the flux at 2.12 \u03bcm);\n\u2022 The near-IR synthesis seems not to be sensitive to very\nrecent star formation (with t . 5 Myr), reinforcing the\nimportance of multi-wavelength stellar population studies of the central region of active galaxies.\n\nBased on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative\nagreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), the\nScience and Technology Facilities Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT\n(Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), Minist\u00e9rio da Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia (Brazil) and south-eastCYT\n(Argentina).
