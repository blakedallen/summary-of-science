When the SWNT-electrode coupling is not axially symmetric, asymmetric\nresonance peaks are found in the conductance and are considered to be due to the interference between two transport\nchannels. These Fano resonances are sensitive to the coupling with electrodes. When the coupling is axially symmetric, no\nasymmetric resonance peaks are observed.\nKey words: Fano resonance, Carbon nanotube, C\u2217 -algebra, Nonequilibrium steady states, Tight-binding model\nPACS: 72.10.-d, 73.63.-b, 73.63.Fg\n\n1. Introduction\nFano resonance [1], a phenomenon that causes\nasymmetric conductance peaks due to interference between resonant and nonresonant states, is observed in\nseveral mesoscopic systems [2,3,4,5]. Recently, first observations of Fano resonances are reported in crossed\ncarbon nanotubes [6]. Kim et. al. claimed that Fano\nresonances can not be observed in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and only appear when two\nnanotubes cross each other because the Fano resonances are attributed to the resonant scattering by\nthe crossed region. Fano resonances are observed in\nmulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as well,\nand are considered to be due to impurities, defects or\ndisorders [7,8]. Also theoretical prediction of Fano resonances for a multiply-connected carbon nanotube has\nbeen reported where asymmetric resonance peaks are\noriginated from the scattering by the localized states\n1\n\nE-mail: junchi@ruri.waseda.jp\n\nPreprint submitted to Physica E\n\non the heptagonal defects [9]. On the contrary, Babi\u0107\net. al. reported that, even in SWNTs without crossed\ncontacts, Fano resonances can be observed due to the\ninterference between narrow and wide orbitals [10].\nIn this report, we investigate the possibility of Fano\nresonances in a single armchair nanotube with the aid\nof the C\u2217 -algebraic method as in our previous work\non the AB-ring [11]. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is\nadopted for describing the electronic states of SWNTs\nand only the linear response regime is considered. We\nshow that, when the SWNT-electrode coupling is axially asymmetric, Fano-like resonances exist for an armchair SWNT.\n2. Electronic States of Finite SWNTs\nWe consider a system consisting of the twodimensional electrodes and a finite-size armchair\nSWNT without caps (see Fig.1(a)). In this section,\nthe electronic structure of the finite-size SWNT is\nreviewed [12]. The nanotube can be regarded as a\n4 September 2018\n\n\f\"#$\nGHI\n\n\u001f!\nDEF\n\nrolled graphene sheet and it is convenient to adopt\nthe primitive lattice vectors of the graphene sheet for\nspecifying the atomic positions:\n(1)\nLn,m = n\u03be + m\u03b7,\n(2)\nLn,m = n\u03be + m\u03b7 + b,\n\u221a\nwhere n\u221aand m are the integers, \u03be = ( 3/2, 3/2)b,\n\u03b7 = (\u2212 3/2, 3/2)b, b = (0, b) and b is the nearestneighbor bond length. The armchair nanotube is\nconstructed by rolling the graphene sheet along the\ny-direction in Fig.1(b).

The transmission coefficient T (x) is\nT (x) =\n\n4\u03c0 2 u4 D2\n|gLR (x)|2\n|\u039b(x)|2\n\nwhere D is the density of states of the electrodes and\nother functions are defined after (2). Here, we are interested in the linear response regime at TL = TR = 0\nand the variables ukL and ukR are taken to be the same\nand k-independent, i.e., ukL = ukR = u.\n3\n\nAs the nanotube length is finite, the integrand of\n(5) is a highly-oscillatory function of x with period \u223c\n3\u03c0t/N . So we consider the average conductance: \u1e20 =\n\u02c6\nhJi/V\nwhere V is the source-drain voltage. In Fig. 2,\nthe average conductance for eV /t \u223c 0.03 is shown as\na function of \u01eb0 which corresponds to the gate voltage. The structural parameters of the nanotube are\n(N, M ) = (7000, 15), which corresponds to the length\nof 1.72 \u03bcm and the diameter of 1.90 nm.\nOne can see that the envelope forms an asymmetric\nresonance peak around at \u01eb0 \u2212 \u01ebF \u2248 \u22120.2t. The case\nof \u01eb0 = \u01ebF corresponds to the half-filled SWNT band\nand the flat region observed from \u01eb0 = \u01ebF to \u01eb0 =\n\u01ebF \u2212 0.17t comes from the conduction band. The sharp\npeak below \u01eb0 = \u01ebF \u2212 0.17t seems to arise from the\nvan Hove singularity of the valence band nearest to the\nconduction band.\nWe remark that the conductance is suppressed just\nbelow the conductance maximum ((\u01eb0 \u2212\u01ebF )/t < \u22120.2).\nThe dip seems to be caused by the interference between\nthe two bands, the conduction and valence bands. This\nmeans that the valence band nearest to the conduction\nband contributes to the interference. In the system of\nthe wave-guide geometry, even without the confined\nstates, similar suppression of the transmission due to\nthe interference has been reported [14].\nWe note that such asymmetric peaks are very sensitive to the coupling between the nanotube and electrodes. In the above calculation, four tunneling matrix\nPM \u22121 (i) \u2212i2a \u2032 m\nl\nelements\n(\u03bb = L, R; i = 1, 2) inm=0 Um\u03bb e\n(\u00b1,\u03bb)\nare taken as the same real numbers.\nvolved in hll\u2032\nThis assumption implies that the nanotube contacts\nwith both electrodes via single sites. This choice breaks\nthe axial symmetry of the coupling, but the left and\nright contacts are equivalent. Indeed, when nanotubeelectrode coupling is axially symmetric, Fano-like\nshapes disappear in the conductance. This could be\nunderstood as follows: Suppose that an asymmetric\npeak arises from the interference between axially symmetric and asymmetric states. Then, if the coupling is\naxially symmetric, non-symmetric nanotube states do\nnot contribute to the transport and the asymmetric\npeak would disappear.\n\n\ftrol of Molecules in Intense Laser Fields\" and the 21st\nCentury COE Program at Waseda University \"Holistic Research and Education Center for Physics of Selforganization Systems\" both from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of\nJapan and by Waseda University Grant for Special Research Projects (2004A-161).\n\nConductance [e2/h]\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.3\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.15 -0.1\n(\u03b50-\u03b5F)/t\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\nReferences\n[1] U.

Wieck, cond-mat/0307590.\n\nWe found that conductance shows Fano-like line\nshapes even in a single SWNT due to the interference\nbetween conduction and valence bands. These peaks\nare strongly affected by the contact condition.\nOur analysis implies that, even for the same SWNTs,\nFano resonances may or may not appear depending on\nthe contact condition with electrodes. Therefore, we\nthink that the observations by Kim et. al. [6] and by\nthe Babi\u0107 [10] are consistent.\nThe exact form of the peaks depends on the nanotube structure and the contact conditions. Therefore,\nin order to reproduce experimentally observed conductance, more detail information on the experimental setting is required. Moreover, the neglected effects of the\nelectron-electron interaction should be taken into account. In the present work, we have shown the possibility of Fano like conductance peak and its dependence on the contact condition. We believe the essence\nof these features is not altered.\n\n[5] K.
