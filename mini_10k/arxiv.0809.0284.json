Up until now a complete scan in all phenomenologically relevant directions of the MSSM at the TeV scale for\nperforming global fit has not been done. Given the imminent start of operation of the LHC, this is a major gap on our quest to\ndiscovering and understanding the physical implications of low energy supersymmetry. The main reason for this is the large\nnumber of parameters involved that makes it computationally extremely expensive using the traditional methods. In this talk I\ndemonstrate that with advanced sampling techniques the problem is solvable. The results from the explored 24-parameter TeV\nscale MSSM (phenoMSSM) are remarkably distinct from previous studies and are independent of models for supersymmetry\nbreaking and mediation mechanisms. Hence they are a more robust guide to searches for supersymmetry and dark matter.\nKeywords: Supersymmetry, Supersymmetric Models, Dark matter\nPACS: 11.30Pb, 12.60.Jv\n\nPhenoMSSM\nThe 105 free physical parameters of the MSSM with\nR-parity [1] makes a complete study of supersymmetry\nan impossible task. For practical purposes phenomenologists had to construct models with fewer parameters at\nunification scale from which RGEs were used to obtain\nthe lower-energy (Msusy ) scale sparticle spectrum and\nproperties. Most famous among this class of constructions is mSUGRA/CMSSM which has just 4 parameters\nand a \u00b1 sign. This has been used for providing benchmark points for sparticle searches and phenomenology.\nBut the approach has important limitations. Supersymmetry discovery definitely requires probe of large regions, in a maximal manner, of its parameter space.\nMoreover, it may be misleading if the models used to\ninterpret experimental results are not realistic or not the\nmost general. Hence the study of MSSM in its complete\nparameters around the electroweak scale is a more natural approach. This will be independent of supersymmetry breaking models, hidden-sector physics, mediation\nmechanisms and renormalisation group running interpolations.\nIn the following sections I demonstrate this more natural approach by applying advanced Monte Carlo technique, called nested sampling [2] which is implemented in the currently private code MultiNest [3],\nto fully explore the MSSM with R-parity and minimal\nflavour violation (MFV) [4] in its entire, 24-dimensional,\nmost phenomenologically important parameters at the\nscale Msusy \u223c 1 TeV \u2013 a set-up we call phenoMSSM [5].\nThe codes SFitter and Fittino [6] can reconstruct\n(weak-scale) MSSM parameters from collider data but\nthe main goal here is to explore all the parameters, perform a global fit to current indirect data and draw inferences for LHC and (future) LC physics. I start with defi-\n\nPreprint: DAMTP-2008-75\n\nnition of Bayes' theorem, describe how its variables were\nconstructed for the phenoMSSM and then give sample\nresults from the exercise of applying the theorem on the\nmodel before concluding in the last section.\nBayesian Inference in Particle Physics:. Bayes'\ntheorem is at the core of the algorithm used to efficiently\nexplore the entire viable parameter regions of the model.\nIt states that\nP(\u03b8 |D, H) = P(D|\u03b8 , H)P(\u03b8 |H)/P(D|H)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P(\u03b8 |H) is the parameters prior density distribution representing the conditional probability of a set\nof parameters \u03b8 given that the model or hypothesis,\nH, is true. It states what values the model parameters are expected to take. With some set of predictions (data or observables), D, obtained from the model,\nP(D|\u03b8 , H) quantifies the likelihood for the model, at the\ngiven parameter values, to be true. For a model with\nRn parameters the n-dimensional integral Z = P(D|H) =\nP(D|\u03b8 , H)P(\u03b8 |H) d \u03b8 represents the evidence for the\nmodel. P(\u03b8 |D, H) is the posterior probability density\nfunction and gives a measure of how well the set of parameters predicts the given data set, D. Nested sampling\nis a general method for evaluating this n-dimensional integral by converting it to a 1-dimensional integral over\na unit interval [2]. The sampling procedure also produces the posterior probability distribution eqn. (1) as\nby-product.\nPhenoMSSM parameters, \u03b8 :. The soft supersymmetry breaking part of the MSSM Lagrangian density have contributions from different types of interactions, Lsoft = Lgauginos + Lsfermions + Ltrilinear + Lhiggs ,\nand sources the 105 supersymmetric free parameters.\nIn order to suppress CP-violation and FCNC real soft\n\n\fterms, diagonal sfermions masses and trilinear couplings, and 1st/2nd generation squark masses and slepton masses degeneracies were assumed. At , Ab and\nA\u03c4 are the most important trilinear couplings but we\nalso include Ae = A\u03bc because it is relevant for (g \u2212\n2)\u03bc computation [7]. All the other trilinear couplings\nand neutrino masses are set to zero. This way the total number of free parameters becomes 20. Adding to\nthese the 4 most important SM \"nuisance\" parameters:\n{mt , mb (mb )MS , \u03b1em (mZ )MS , \u03b1s (mZ )MS }, makes a total of\n24 physical parameters in phenoMSSM.

We use high precision\nelectroweak and B-physics collider observables and the\ndark matter relic density from WMAP5 results (all\nshown in Table 2) to study the viable parameter regions of the phenoMSSM. Its predictions for these\nobservables were obtained from the 24 input parameters via SOFTSUSY2.0.17 [12] for producing the\nMSSM spectrum; micrOMEGAs2.1 [13] for computing neutralino dark matter relic density, the branching\nratio BR(Bs \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (g \u2212 2)\u03bc ; SuperIso2.0 [14] for\npredicting the Isospin asymmetry in the decays B \u2192\nK \u2217 \u03b3 and BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3 ) with all NLO supersymmetric\nQCD and NNLO SM QCD contributions included; and\nsusyPOPE [15] for computing W -boson mass mW , the\neffective leptonic mixing angle variable sin2 \u03b8elep\nf f , and the\n\ntotal Z-boson decay width, \u0393Z , at two loops in the dominant MSSM parameters.

At each\nparameter-space point the values were passed in SUSY\nLe Houches Accord (SLHA) format [8] to the different\nparticle physics software used for predicting the physical\nobservables. The predictions were then checked against\nexperimental values with (non)deviations quantified by\nthe likelihood function. Next, the likelihoods modulate\nthe parameter prior probabilities to produce the Bayesian\nevidence and posterior probability distributions for the\nmodel. Two prior probability density ranges, 1 TeV and\n2 TeV, were used for the purely supersymmetric parameters (the first 20 listed in Table 1) with the gaugino\nmasses and trilinear couplings allowed to take both positive and negative values. The slepton and squark masses\nwere bounded from below at 100 GeV. The SM parameters were taken as Gaussian noise around their mean experimental values: mt = 172.6 \u00b1 1.4, mb (mb )MS = 4.2 \u00b1\n0.07, 1/\u03b1em (mZ )MS = 127.918 \u00b1 0.018 and \u03b1s (mZ )MS =\n0.1172 \u00b1 0.002.\nResults. Here I give some results from the exploration exercise, more results and analysis on the global\nfit to data is in progress [5]. The results are quite robust under change of parameter prior ranges. Figure 1\nshows that mh0 is most likely around 115 to 117 GeV,\n\n\f1500\n\nand shows the existence of chargino-neutralino (DM)\nco-annihilation. The whole procedure can be applied to\nother BSM constructions such as those with additional\nCP-violating and FCNC sources and non-zero neutrino\nmasses.

The different neutralino dark\nmatter (DM) annihilation mechanisms at early times of\nthe universe that leads to the value of its relic density\ntoday are important in defining different phenomenological regions in model parameter space. A profound\nfeature of the phenoMSSM is that it shows lots of\nchargino co-annihilation as shown in Figure 1. The\ngluino to neutralino mass ratio is an interesting quantity that characterises different models of supersymmetry (breaking.) For instance mSUGRA(AMSB) with predominantly bino(wino) LSP has mg\u0303 /m\u03c7\u0303 0 \u2248 6(9) [16].\n1\nThe mirage mediation [17] and the LARGE volume [18]\nscenarios have the characteristic ratio less than 6 and\nbetween 3 to 4 respectively. Figure 2 shows the ppd of\nthis quantity, providing discrimination between the phenoMSSM and the other models. This feature is robust to\nprior parameter ranges.\nConclusion:. With advanced Bayesian technique it\nis possible to fully explore weak-scale MSSM in all of its\nphenomenologically relevant parameter directions. Doing this is very important since low energy supersymmetry is the main focus of the LHC supersymmetry-search\nexperiments. Hence such low energy approach as demonstrated here will be a better guide and much more realistic.
