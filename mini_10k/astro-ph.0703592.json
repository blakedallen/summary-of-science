We discuss the scientific studies that can be done with measurements of the unresolved\nFIRB anisotropies including a determination of the large scale bias and the small-scale halo occupation\ndistribution of FIRB sources with fluxes below the point-source detection level.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory -large scale structure of universe - diffuse radiation - infrared:\ngalaxies\nKnox et al. (2001), the amplitude and the shape of the\nFIRB anisotropy spectrum capture to some extent informations on the number counts of sources and their redshift\ndistribution below the point source detection level, while\na detailed multi-frequency analysis of far-IR anisotropies\ncan be performed to establish the spectral energy distribution (SED) of dust characterized by a mean temperature\nand a departure from the black-body spectrum.\nSince the study of Knox et al. (2001), detailed phenomenological models have been developed to describe the\ngalaxy distribution in large-scale structure through their\nconnection to the underlying dark matter halo distribution\nbased on the halo model (see review in Cooray & Sheth\n2002). The halo model allows one to describe the galaxy\nclustering power spectrum through the halo occupation\nnumber or the number of galaxies in a dark matter halo as\na function of the halo mass. The occupation number description can be further extended to account for the galaxy\ndistribution in a given dark matter halo mass as a function of the luminosity through what are now called conditional luminosity functions (CLFs; Cooray 2005). With\nCLFs tuned to reproduce the far-IR 350 \u03bcm luminosity\nfunctions of Lagache et al. (2003), we extend the halo\nmodel to describe clustering at longer wavelengths and\nstudy how clustering measurements of unresolved fluctuations can be modeled, and informations extracted, through\nthe halo model (Cooray & Sheth 2002).\nOur study is mostly motivated by the possibility to\nstudy FIRB anisotropies in near future with wide-field\nscan maps at 250 \u03bcm, 350 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm from the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE; Griffin et\nal. 2006) aboard the Herschel observatory. A challenge\nfor anisotropy measurements at these wavelengths is the\nconfusion resulting from the thermal dust emission within\nour own Galaxy. We consider the extent to which the\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe total intensity of the extragalactic background light\nat far-IR wavelengths is now established with absolute\nphotometry (Puget et al. 1996; Fixsen et al. 1998; Dwek\net al. 1998), while deep surveys with existing or previous\ninstruments have resolved the cosmic far-IR background\n(FIRB) to discreet sources at various fractions given the\nwavelength (see reviews in Blain et al. 2002; Hauser &\nDwek 2001; Lagache et al. 2005). Based on these results,\nthe FIRB light is believed to be mostly due to the thermal\nemission from interstellar dust in z \u223c 1 to 3 galaxies with\ndust heated by ultraviolet radiation from stars and active\ngalactic nuclei. The far-IR source counts also include a\ncontribution from low-redshift spiral galaxies (Lagache et\nal. 2005).\nUnfortunately even the deepest images of far-IR sky using instruments on board the Herschel observatory1 will\nbe limited by source confusion. For example, at 350 \u03bcm,\nat most 10% of the total background intensity will be resolved to individual sources (e.g., Lagache et al. 2003).\nTo study the properties of the sources that dominate the\nbackground light, we must consider the statistics of the\nunresolved component.\nIn this respect, a useful statistic associated with the\nunresolved background is the angular power spectrum of\nFIRB anisotropies (Haiman & Knox 2000; Knox et al.\n2001; Scott & White 1999; Negrello et al. 2007). Unresolved far-IR background sources are expected to trace\nthe correlated large-scale structure and these correlations\nwill be reflected in the unresolved fluctuations. Based on\nprevious models, these fluctuations are expected to be at\nthe level of 5% to 10% of the mean intensity at sub-degree\nangular scales (Haiman & Knox 1999). As discussed in\n1 http://herschel.esac.esa.int/\n\n1\n\n\f2\nGalactic dust emission can be removed using multiwavelength informations from Herschel-SPIRE and using Herschel complemented by Planck data on the same survey\nfield. Finally, we also consider how to optimize the area\nof a SPIRE wide-field survey assuming a fixed observation\ntime and consider the extent to which information related\nto occupation number of FIRB sources can be extracted.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next Section, we discuss the angular power spectrum of far-IR\nanisotropies based on a halo model for the far-IR sources\nnormalized to be roughly consistent with luminosity functions of Lagache et al. (2003). We discuss issues related\nto foreground confusion and the multi-frequency component separation of Galactic dust in Section 3. In Section 4\nwe discuss the applications of anisotropy measurements\nand outline the importance of Herschel measurements at\nhigher angular resolution than Planck. The latter only\nprovides clustering measurements in the 2-halo part of\nthe anisotropy spectrum, while to extract some information on the source distribution, clustering measurements\nat small angular scales corresponding to the 1-halo term\nand observable with Herschel-SPIRE are required. When\nillustrating our calculations, we take cosmological parameters from the currently favored flat-\u039bCDM cosmology with\n\u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03c38 = 0.84.\n2. ANGULAR POWER SPECTRUM\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, to describe the FIRB\nanisotropy power spectrum, we make use of an approach\nbased on the halo model. Using the Limber approximation\n(Limber 1954), the angular power spectrum can be written\nas (Knox et al. 2001)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2032\ndr a2 (z)\nl\n\u2032\nCl\u03bb\u03bb = dz\n,\nz\n, (1)\n\u012b\n(z)\n\u012b\n(z)P\nk\n=\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nss\ndz d2A\ndA\nwhere r is the conformal distance or lookback time from\nthe observer, dA is the comoving angular diameter distance, and j\u0304\u03bb (z) is the mean emissivity per comoving unit\nvolume at wavelength \u03bb as a function of redshift z for\nsources below a certain flux limit.\nInstead of intensity units, hereafter, we will work primarily in terms of antenna temperature units (\u03bcKRJ ) with\nthe conversion factor for the angular power spectrum given\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u2032 2\n\u2202I(\u03bb\u2032 )\n)\nas \u2202I(\u03bb)\n= (\u03bb\u03bb\n. We obtain j\u0304\u03bb (z) using the lu\u2202T\n\u2202T\n4k2\nB\n\nminosity function models of Lagache et al. (2003). Note\nthat the contribution\nR \u221e todrthe IRB intensity, at a given wavelength, is I\u03bb = 0 dz dz\na(z)\u012b\u03bb (z) and can also be written\nR\u221e\nas I\u03bb = 0 S(dN/dS)dS once luminosities are converted\nto fluxes and dN/dS is the differential number counts obtained through a volume integral of the luminosity functions.\nIn Eq. (1), fluctuations in the source density field are\ncharacterized by the three dimensional power spectrum\nPss (k) = P 1h (k) + P 2h (k). The two terms under the halo\nmodel are clustering of FIRB sources in two different halos\n(2h) and clustering within the same halo (1h), and given\nby (Cooray & Sheth 2002):\nP 2h (k) =\n\n\u0014Z\n\ndM n(M ) b(M )\n\n\u00152\nhNt (M )i\nu(k|M ) P lin (k)\nn\u0304g\n\nP\n\n1h\n\n(k) =\n\nZ\n\ndM n(M )\n\n2hNs ihNc iu(k|M ) + hNs i2 u2 (k|M )\n(2),\nn\u03042g\n\nrespectively with the halo occupation number hNt (M )i =\nhNs i+hNc i. Here, u(k|M ) is the normalized density profile\nin Fourier space, n(M ) is the halo mass function, b(M ) is\nthe halo bias relative to the linear density field, and n\u0304g\nis the number density of sources. As written, the 2-halo\nterm with P 2h (k) traces the linear power spectrum scaled\nby a bias factor for these sources.\n2.1. Conditional Luminosity Functions\nIn this paper, instead of the simple halo occupation\nnumber as written above, we extend the halo model with\nconditional luminosity functions to capture the luminosity\ndistribution of galaxies in a given dark matter halo (the\nCLF model; Cooray & Milosavljevi\u0107 2005; Cooray 2005;\nYang et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2005). The simple halo occupation number treats all galaxies the same without allowing for variations in the number counts with source luminosity or flux while CLFs describe the number of galaxies in a given dark matter halo mass as a function of the\nluminosity \u03a6(L|M ) \u2261 dhN i/dL. Another motivation to\nconsider a CLF model for FIRB sources is the availability\nof preliminary models of the source counts which assume\nthe behavior of the redshift evolution of far-IR source SED\n(e.g., Lagache et al. 2003). We make use of the luminosity\nfunctions at 350 \u03bcm that were generated by Lagache et al.\n(2003) as a function of the redshift, \u03a6L03 (L, z), and model\nCLFs to return a function comparable to these luminosity functions once galaxy luminosities are associated with\ndark matter halos.\nThe matching is done such that we require\nZ\n\u03a6(L, z) = dM dn/dM (z)\u03a6(L|M, z) ,\n(3)\nto be roughly consistent with the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of Lagache et al. (2003) by varying\nparameters related to \u03a6(L|M, z). We do not consider detailed models through a likelihood analysis since Lagache\net al. (2003) luminosity functions are purely a phenomenological model of the source distribution based on an assumed SED for galaxies with a normalization to reproduce 60 \u03bcm IRAS luminosity function at low redshifts.\nThe model involves two types of far-IR sources described\nas \"normal\" galaxies and \"starburst\" galaxies. The normal galaxies have a luminosity function of the Schechter\nform with a pure (1 + z) number density evolution out to\na z = 0.4 and a constant comoving density beyond that to\nz = 5. The luminosity function of the starburst population\nand its evolution are more complicated since they both involve the evolution in the density and in the cut-off luminosity. In Lagache et al. (2003), the redshift dependences\nare taken to be consistent with existing observations so far\nat 15 \u03bcm and 850 \u03bcm. We do not reproduce those details\nhere but refer the reader to the paper by Lagache et al.\n(2003).\nTo capture a consistent shape and redshift evolution\nfrom our CLFs, we divide the source sample into normal and starburst galaxies and consider models of the two\npopulations separately. Following well-known results in\nstudies related to the galaxy distribution that show differences in the properties of central and satellite galaxies in\n\n\f3\ndark matter halos (e.g., Kravtsov et al. 2004; Berlind et\nal. 2003), we subdivide the CLF into central and satellite galaxies for both populations. These conditional functions are written in the same manner that has been used to\nstudy galaxy statistics at optical and near-IR wavelengths,\nwith\n\u03a6(L|M, z) = \u03a6cen (L|M, z) + \u03a6sat (L|M, z)\nfcen (M, z)\n\u00d7\n\u03a6cen (L|M, z) = \u221a\n2\u03c0 ln(10)\u03c3cen L\n\u001b\n\u001a\nlog [L/Lc (M, z)]2\nexp \u2212 10\n2\u03c3cen\n\u03a6sat (L|M, z) = A(M, z)L\u03b3 .\n\n(4)\n\nHere, fcen (M, z) is a selection function introduced to account for the efficiency of galaxy formation as a function\nof the halo mass, given that the galaxy formation of low\nmass halos may be inefficient and that not all dark matter\nhalos may host a galaxy:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1\nlog(M ) \u2212 log(Mcen\u2212cut(z))\nfcen (M, z) =\n1 + erf\n,.\n2\n\u03c3\n(5)\nIn our fiducial description, we will take numerical values\nof Mcen\u2212cut = 1010 Msun and \u03c3 = 0.5 (Cooray 2005).\nIn Equation 4, Lc (M, z) is the relation between the central galaxy luminosity of a given dark matter halo and\nits halo mass, taken to be a function of the redshift, while\n\u03c3cen , with an assumed value of 0.25 to reproduce the shape\nof Lagache et al. luminosity functions when L > 1011 , is\nthe log-normal dispersion in this relation. For an analytical description of the Lc (M, z) relation, we make use of the\nform suggested by Vale & Ostriker (2004) where this relation was established as appropriate for bJ -band galaxies\nby inverting the 2dFGRS luminosity function. We follow\nthe same procedure by inverting the 60 \u03bcm LF at low redshifts from IRAS data as well as 350 \u03bcm LFs as derived\nby Lagache et al. (2003). The relation is described with a\ngeneral fitting formula given by\nLc (M, z) = L0 (1 + z)\u03b1\n\n(M/M1 )a\n.\n[b + (M/M1 )cd(1+z)\u03b7 ]1/d\n\n(6)\n\nAt 350 \u03bcm, for starburst galaxies, the parameters have\nvalues of L0 = 2 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 , M1 = 6 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 , a = 4.0,\nb = 0.4, c = 3.8, and d = 0.23. For other wavelengths this\nrelation can be simply scaled based on a spectral energy\ndistribution such as the one employed in Lagache et al.\n(2003). To capture the redshift dependence of the luminosity function, we set non-zero values for \u03b1 and \u03b7 with\n0.05 and 0.1, respectively. We employ the same analytical model for normal galaxies that appear at halo centers\nwith parameters L0 = 6 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 , M1 = 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ,\na = 4.0, b = 0.6, c = 3.9, and d = 0.2 and ignore the\nmild redshift evolution at low redshifts in the Lagache et\nal. (2003) model. This is not a concern for us since the\nanisotropies that will be studied with Herschel-SPIRE will\nbe dominated by the starburst galaxy population while\nproper statistics of the normal galaxy population will only\nbe needed to understand the source counts at low redshifts\nbased on the resolved number counts.\nIn Figure 1, we plot a comparison of the Lc (M, z) relation at z = 1 for both normal and starburst galaxies. As\n\nshown and extracted, based on this simple model, normal\ngalaxies can appear as central galaxies in halo down to\nsmaller mass than the starburst galaxies. In return, starburst galaxies that appear at halo center are brighter at\n350 \u03bcm than normal galaxies for the same halo mass if the\nhalo mass is greater than 2.1012M\u2299 .\nFor satellites, the normalization A(M ) of the satellite\nCLF can be obtained by defining Ls (M, z) \u2261 Ltot (M, z) \u2212\nR Lmax sat\nLc (M, z) and requiring that Ls (M, z) = Lmin\n\u03a6 (L|M, z)LdL,\nwhere the minimum luminosity of a satellite is Lmin . In\nthe luminosity ranges of interest, with \u03b3 between -0.5 to -1,\nCLFs are mostly independent of the exact value assumed\nfor Lmin as long as it lies in the range (106 \u2212 108 )L\u2299 . To\ndescribe the total far-IR luminosity of a given dark matter\nhalo we make use of the following phenomenological form:\n(\nLc (M, z)\nM \u2264 Msat\n\u0010\n\u00114\nLtot (M, z) =\n(7)\nLc (M, z) MMsat M > Msat\n\nHere, Msat denotes the mass-scale at which satellites begin to appear in dark matter halos (taken to \u223c 1011 for\nnormal galaxies and 5 \u00d7 1012 for starburst galaxies) with\nluminosities as corresponding to those in the given sample of galaxies. The power-law slope is fixed at 4, independently of the redshift and consistent with total galaxy\nluminosity-cluster mass relations at near-IR wavelengths\n(e.g., Lin & Mohr 2004). Whether such a relation holds\nfor far-IR luminosity content of dark matter halos may\nbe testable with Herschel data in the same manner it has\nbeen tested at optical and near-IR wavelengths using cluster catalogs.\nSince we have divided the far-IR source population into\nnormal and starburst galaxies, we have an additional freedom on how to distribute these galaxies in dark matter\nhalos and this freedom leads to large degeneracies that\ncannot be simply separated from the luminosity function\nalone, even if the luminosity function is available for both\nsource types separately. The clustering measurements, including unresolved anisotropies, will make possible to correctly match the mass scales and the relative distribution\nof normal and starburst populations in dark matter halos\nin the same manner luminosity functions and clustering\nstudies have been used to identify relative distributions of\nearly- and late-type galaxies (such as the fraction of central\ngalaxies, that appear as late or early type, as a function of\nthe halo mass) at optical wavelengths. If we assume that\na fraction of fc (M, z) galaxies at halo centers are normal\ngalaxies and a fraction fs (M, z) of satellite galaxies are\nnormal galaxies, then the luminosity function of normal\n(n) galaxies can be written as\nZ\ndn\nn\n(z)\n\u03a6 (L, z) = dM\ndM\n\u00d7 [fc (M, z)\u03a6nc (L|M, z) + fs (M, z)\u03a6ns (L|M, z)] . (8)\n\nThe luminosity function of starburst galaxies follows by\ntaking 1 \u2212 fc (M, z) and 1 \u2212 fs (M, z) fractions and integrating with CLFs as defined for starburst galaxy population. Given that we have large degeneracies in how to\ndistribute the population, we take the simple approach\nthat in a given halo, we can take the fraction to be same\nfor satellites and centrals (in practice since only one central galaxy is present, this would mean that some halo\n\n\f4\n\n2.2. Far-IR Source Occupation Numbers\nBy integrating CLFs over luminosity down to a fixed\nluminosity, we can recover the halo occupation number\nthrough\nZ\nhN (M )i =\n\ndL\u03a6(L|M ) .\n\n(9)\n\nIn Figure 4, we illustrate the occupation number at z = 1\nfor both normal and starburst populations (and divided\nto central and satellite galaxies in both cases) with Lmax\ncorresponding to sources with a maximum flux below 100\nmJy at 350 \u03bcm. The combined occupation number cannot\nbe simply described by a power-law though the parameter\n\u03b3 describing the satellite CLF luminosity dependence is\nrelated to the power-law slope \u03b2s when occupation number of satellites is described such that hNs (M )i \u221d Ms\u03b2 at\nthe high mass end. Note that the central galaxy occupation number is always one above some mass scale. For\nsources fainter than 100 mJy at z = 1 at 350 \u03bcm, the minimum mass at which normal galaxies appear is about few\ntimes 1010 M\u2299 , while the mass scale at which starburst\nappear is few times 1011 M\u2299 . When calculating the power\nspectrum, we integrate the CLFs over the assumed cut-off\nluminosity to extract the necessary occupation numbers\nfor both central and satellite galaxies.\nWhile we have provided a bit complicated model, so as\nto illustrate how the exact modeling can be done once luminosity functions are established at far-IR wavelengths\nat several different redshifts beyond the low-redshift short\n\n13\n\n10\n\nNormal\nStarburst\n12\n\n10\nLc (Lsun)\n\ncenters have central galaxies while others have starbursts)\nand let fc (M, z) = 0.1, independent of redshift and above\nthe mass at which starburst galaxies appear in halo centers, while this fraction is 1 below the mass scale at which\nstarbursts appear (this mass scale is determined based on\na simple match to starburst luminosity functions of Lagache et al. 2003). The exact halo mass and redshift\ndependences would be some of the interesting parameters\nthat can be potentially extracted from data if adequate\nstatistics are available. The same parameters can be investigated from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation\nwith a focus on the far-IR luminosities and we encourage\nsuch studies with existing models.\nIn Figure 2, we illustrate the comparison between our\nmodel, which uses the dark matter halo mass as the starting point to model the galaxy distribution, and Lagache et\nal. (2003) LFs at 350 \u03bcm at z = 1, which uses a SED and\nthe 60 \u03bcm LF at low redshifts as a way to build an evolutionary model of source counts with parameters matched\nto existing data. In Figure 3, we show the normalized redshift distribution\nR of sources (both normal and starburst\ngalaxy types), dz n(z) = 1, with fluxes below 100 mJy.\nAs shown here, the redshift distribution is such that the\nnumbers peak at z > 1, but extends to higher redshifts\nwith a very slow decrease when z > 3.\nWhile we have not performed a detailed model fit, which\nwe think is premature given the limited data at these farIR wavelengths, we have varied parameters to get a reasonable consistency between two prescriptions in the literature to model IR source counts. More importantly, our\ndescription is outlined in a way that, we think, will allow\nto extract a model based on future measurements of both\nluminosity functions and clustering at far-IR wavelengths.\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10 10\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n13\n\n10\nMass (Msun)\n\n14\n\n10\n\n15\n\n10\n\nFig. 1.- The relation between the 350 \u03bcm luminosity of a central\ngalaxy in a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass (at a\nredshift of one). We also show the expected relation between the\n350 \u03bcm luminosity of a \"normal\" galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 as a\nfunction of the halo mass. In our modeling, we are assuming that\n90% of the central galaxies in halos roughly above 1012 M\u2299 are of\nthe starburst type while at the low mass-end of dark matter halos,\nall central galaxies are normal galaxy types, in the prescription of\nLagache et al. (2003).\n\nwavelength LFs now available from surveys with IRAS, for\nclustering studies, the behavior of the occupation number\nas suggested by CLFs can be captured with a model of\nthe form hNt (M, z)i = 1 + hNs (M )i when M > Mmin(z)\nand 0 otherwise, with the assumption of a central FIRB\nsource in each halo (hNc (M )i = 1) above some mass scale\nand a power-law distribution of satellites with hNs (M )i =\n(M/Mmin )\u03b2 . The value of Mmin , for example, can be readily extracted from occupation numbers shown in Figure 4,\nor if one needs to vary to a different flux, based on the\nmatching between luminosity and mass from the Lc (M )\nrelation shown in Figure 1, for example. Instead of parameters in the CLF, we will show the extent to which we\ncan extract a parameter such as \u03b2 from the 1-halo term of\nthe anisotropy power spectrum given that the small scale\nclustering is strongly sensitive to the statistics related to\nsatellite galaxies.\n2.3. Far-IR Source Clustering Bias\nIn general source clustering at large angular scales can\nbe described with the linear matter power spectrum scaled\nby a constant, scale-free bias factor such that\nPss (k) \u2248 b2s P lin (k) .\n\n(10)\n\nIn terms of the CLF halo model, this large scale source\nbias can be written as a combination of the bias of normal\nand starburst galaxies by noting that the large-scale bias\nfactor of, for example, normal galaxies as a function of\nsource luminosity and the redshift is\nZ\ndn\nbn (L, z) = dM\n(z) bhalo (M, z)\ndM\n[fc (M, z)\u03a6nc (L|M, z) + fs (M, z)\u03a6ns (L|M, z)]\n\u00d7\n. (11)\n\u03a6n (L, z)\nThe total galaxy bias, as necessary for unresolved anisotropy\nclustering measurements, can be calculated by replacing\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 5.- Dust removal results for a 10, 400 and 2500 deg2 area with Planck and Herschel and for a 2500 deg2 area with Planck around the\nELAIS-S1 field (from top to bottom and left to right). All spectra are in antenna temperature, \u03bcK2RJ , units at 350 \u03bcm. The foreground and\nshot-noise residual are respectively the solid red and purple lines. The green solid line is the Galactic dust power spectrum at 350 \u03bcm. The\nsolid light blue and black lines are respectively the combined detector noise (once the optimal frequency mixing is applied) and the combined\nshot-noise. The FIRB clustering contribution is shown as orange solid, dotted, dashed lines for \u03b2 of 0.85, 0.6, 1 respectively. The blue squares\n= 0.5).\nrepresent the binned theoretical FIRB power spectrum with its error ( \u2206l\nl\n\n\u03a6(L|M, z) with the sum of both normal and starburst\nCLFs and replacing the LF for normal galaxies with the\ntotal.\nWhen separately considered, given that normal galaxies are found mostly in halo centers at the low mass end,\nthe predicted bias factors are generally at the level of \u223c 1\nor slight below one. The starburst galaxies, however, are\nmostly at halo centers at the high mass end and their bias\nfactors are expected to be larger than 1. Thus, the starburst population is expected to be both strongly clustered\nand to have both large correlation lengths or bias factors.\nUsing the CLF halo model, if the clustering spectrum of\nresolved sources at z \u223c 1 with fluxes above 100 mJy is\nmeasured, we find that the bias factors will be expected\nto be order 2.0. Such a large bias factor, or equivalently a\nlarge correlation length, is consistent with some of the limited suggestions in the literature that far-IR sources with\nbright fluxes are strongly clustered (e.g., Blain et al. 2004).\nAt the same flux cut, the unresolved anisotropies are expected to have a bias factor of the order 1.1. This value is\n\nsubstantially below the bias factor of resolved sources at\nthe same flux cut since unresolved anisotropies are dominated by sources that are substantially fainter than the\nsources just below the flux cut.\n2.4. Shot-noise power spectrum\nIn addition to the clustering signal, at small angular\nscales, the finite density of sources leads to a shot-noise\ntype power spectrum in the IRB spatial fluctuations. This\nshot-noise can be estimated through number counts such\nRS\nthat Clshot = 0 cut dS S 2 (dN/dS) when Scut is the flux cut\noff value related to the removal of resolved sources.We use\nthe confusion noise as estimated by Hspot2 for Herschel,\n25, 29, 24.5 mJy (5\u03c3) at 250, 350 and 500 \u03bcm and by\nNegrello et al.

(1999) and maps from\nSchlegel et al. (1998) (cleaned IRAS with a calibration obtained on DIRBE with an effective angular resolution of 6\narcminutes) over the frequency range of 217 GHz to 1200\nGHz (250 \u03bcm to 1.2 mm). We fit with a power law the\npower spectrum of the Galactic dust of a 4900 deg2 area\naround ELAIS-S1 field at each frequency. We use the variance of the signal in our smaller fields to scale down the\nfitted power spectrum to these smaller fields. The FIRB\nanisotropy power spectrum modeled at 350 \u03bcm following\nthe halo model above is interpolated to other wavelengths\n\nwith \u03c40 = (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22125 , T = 18.5 \u00b1 1.2K and \u03b1 =\n0.64 \u00b1 0.12.\nTo study the extent to which foreground dust confusion\ncan be reduced we used the cleaning technique outlined in\nTegmark et al. (2003), where multifrequency maps from\nWMAP first-year data were used to produce the so-called\nTOH foreground-cleaned CMB map. The technique recommends taking a linear combination\nalm 's\nP of observed\ni i\nin each frequency band i, alm =\nf req=i wl alm , with\nweights wi chosen to minimize foreground contamination\nfrom Galactic dust. We decompose the signal at each frei\nquency as ailm = uilm + flm\n+ nilm where u, f , and n stand\nrespectively for unresolved FIRB, foregrounds (CMB and\nGalactic dust), and noise. We then minimize the resulting power spectrum of extragalactic FIRB fluctuations, assuming the frequency spectrum of this component follows\nthat of Fixsen et al. (1998) through h|alm |2 i = wl T Cwl\nusing weights under the constraint wlT * e = 1, where e is\na column vector with the relative amplitude of the FIRB\nspectrum.\nThe above condition allows to sum the different frequencies without reducing the FIRB component, and permits to optimally subtract the Galactic dust (CMB itself\nas a foreground only makes a minor impact at frequencies above 500 GHz). Here, the Clij matrix represents\nh(ailm )\u2020 ajlm i. As derived in Tegmark et al. (2003), the\nweights that minimize the power h|alm |2 i are\nwl =\n\nC \u22121 e\n.\neT C \u22121 e\n\n(13)\n\n\f7\nThe estimate of residual dust level with this method\nis clearly optimistic since the FIRB spectrum is poorly\nknown. We will quantify the impact of the uncertainty related to the spectrum in terms of an overall uncertainty in\nthe cumulative signal-to-noise ratio for detection of FIRB\nfluctuations in the presence of Galactic dust. To quantify\nour results, we center our simulation around ELAIS-S1\n(RA-DEC : 7.8,-44.2), which is a preferred region known\nto be least contaminated with cirrus even after considering\na large region around this field.\nIn our calculations we assume an uncorrelated noise\npower spectrum, with hnilm njl\u2032 m\u2032 i = \u03b4ij \u03b4mm\u2032 \u03b4ll\u2032 Nl\u2032 , between SPIRE bands. For Nl\u2032 , we take 1\u03c3 noise levels for\na SPIRE 10 deg2 survey with a 1000 hour integration:\n1.6, 2.1 and 1.7 mJy at 250, 350, 500 \u03bcm (obtained from\nHSpot) and then degrade as the survey area is increased.\nTo combine Herschel data with Planck, we make use of\n217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz channels of Planck HFI with\nequivalent noise of 13.4, 25.2, 48.4 and 55.4 mJy 3 . Since\nwide-field Herschel-SPIRE maps are raster-scanned, 1/fnoise impact measurements of large angular scale fluctuations. We model this by modifying the overall noise spectrum to be Nl = Nl\u2032 (1 + lknee /l) (e.g., Crawford 2007)\nand take lknee = 103 corresponding to a 1/f knee at a frequency of 100 mHz with a scan rate of 60\"/sec. While\nwe include 1/f-noise, to effectively remove it requires two\npasses of the same field in orthogonal directions. Generally, this requires that for a given area, one spend twice\nas long than when a survey is conducted for point source\ndetections only. Given the maximum scan rate, for a fixed\nintegration time, there is also a maximum area one can\ncover, but we have ignored this restriction here when estimating the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of the sky\narea as the maximum scan rate is not yet established. We\nneglect Planck 1/f-noise residual, since we believe it would\nnot be as strong as Herschel one on our scales of interest\ndue to Planck's faster scanning speed.\n4. RESULTS & DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 5 shows examples of the FIRB power spectrum\nestimated on a 10, 400, and 2500 square degree fields\naround a very low foreground Galactic dust field centered\naround ELAIS-S1 using the 3 SPIRE bands (corresponding to central frequencies of 577, 833 and 1200 GHz) with\na 1000 hours integration time and 4 of Planck frequency\nbands (217, 353, 545, 857 GHz, assuming the 14 month\nsurvey). According to figure 5, these surveys can measure\naccurately the power spectrum of FIRB on scales smaller\nthan 30 arcminutes (l \u2243 400), however, the smallest scales\nmight be biased by the confusion noise coming from the\nshot-noise term. Larger scales are not very well measured\nby the 10 deg2 survey due to a large remaining cosmic\nvariance. On the other hand, the Galactic dust residuals\nare much smaller for the smaller area survey (typically a\nfactor 5 to 10 in power).\n4.1. Optimal survey area\nIn addition to 3 field sizes highlighted in Fig. 5, it could\nbe that the angular power spectrum might be measured\nat a more significant level if the field size is optimized for\nthese measurements given a finite integration time. We\n3 http://www.rssd.esa.int/Planck\n\nFig. 6.- Total signal-to-noise on the estimate of the FIRB clustering power spectrum. We took into account the instrumental noise,\nthe cosmic variance, and the foreground and shot-noise residuals for\ndifferent sky coverage (from 3 to 5000 deg2 ). The blue triangles\nand red squares represent a \"clean\" area selected from SFD98 dust\nmap and centered around ELAIS-S1 field using Herschel and Herschel+Planck, respectively. In each selected survey size, we assume\na total integration time of 1000 hours with Herschel-SPIRE, while\nthe integration time for Planck is independent of the survey area\ngiven that Planck data is an all-sky survey be design. The solid orange area represents the signal-to-noise ratio achievable when FIRB\nspectrum is taken to be uncertain at the \u00b1 1 \u03c3 level of Fixsen et al.\n(1998) analytical model (see, Eq. 3).\n\ntherefore compute the noise level and the Galactic dust\nlevel in the FIRB power spectrum estimate for different\nfield size assuming a total of 1000 hour integration time\nfor Herschel/SPIRE observations. To show quantitatively\nhow well different field sizes are measuring clustering of\nthe unresolved component, we computed the total signal\nto noise (optimal sum on all the mode l), with the signal\nClclus being the FIRB power spectrum due to clustering,\nand the noise being the sum of the instrumental noise (Nl )\nvariance, the cosmic variance and the residual Galactic\ndust and shot-noise :\nv\nu lmax \u0012 clus \u00132\nu X\nCl\nS/N = t\n,\n(14)\nXl\nl=lmin\n\nwhere\n\ns\n\nXl = (Nl + ClFIRB )\n\n2\n+ Rl ,\n(2l + 1)fsky\n\n(15)\n\nand ClFIRB = Clclus + Clshot and fsky is the fraction of sky\ncovered. The residual shot-noise is taken as the combination of the 1 \u03c3 uncertainties computed by a Fisher matrix\nanalysis (Tegmark et al. 1997) at each frequency for each\ninstrument (Planck and Herschel/SPIRE), given a model\nwhere dust and FIRB clustering power spectrum shape are\nknown. These residual shot-noise estimates are probably\noptimistic, especially for Planck since its angular resolution does not allow to measure the small angular scale\n(\u03b8 < 0.5\u2032 ) where the shot-noise term dominates.\n\n\f8\n1.10\n\nPlanck\nPlanck + Herschel\n\nln(bias)\n\n1.05\n\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n0.65\n\n0.75\n\n0.85\n\u03b2s\n\n0.95\n\n1.05\n\nFig. 8.- Constraints on \u03b2s and the source bias factor from unresolved FIRB clustering measurements with Herschel-SPIRE and\nPlanck. The ellipse describe the 95% confidence level errors after\nmarginalizing over 2 additional parameters related to the uncertain\nredshift distribution of sources. As shown, Planck measurements\n(over 2500 deg2 ) alone do not establish information captured in the\n1-halo term, such as the satellite occupation number, while with\nHerschel, small angular scale clustering is adequately measured to\nproperly establish statistics related to far-IR sources, such as the\nslope of the occupation number. While we have only considered\nclustering of unresolved anisotropies here, in a large-are survey,\nthe combination of LFs, resolved source clustering, and unresolved\nanisotropies can be used to establish an improved model with parameterization based on the CLFs.\n\nFig. 7.- The signal-to-noise ratio on the estimate of the FIRB\nclustering power spectrum as a function of the multipole. Top:\nThe signal-to-noise as a function of the multipole. Bottom: The\ncumulative signal-to-noise ratio as a function of the multipole. As\nillustrated, Planck (HFI) can make higher signal-to-noise clustering\nmeasurements of FIRB anisotropies, though the measurements are\nlimited to multipoles of less than about 4000. The combination of\nHerschel and Planck over 400 deg2 , with Herschel imaging data in\nan integration of 1000 hours, has the highest overall signal-to-noise\nratio for the clustering measurements.\n\nThe results obtained are summarized in Figure 6. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio increases with the area covered from\n65 with 3 deg2 to 360 with 400-600 deg2 due to the decrease of the cosmic variance, and then decreases due to\nthe increase of the Galactic dust residual and the lower\nobservation depth. Adding the Planck channels at 217,\n353, 545 and 857 GHz does not change the overall sensitivity if the used Planck field is smaller than 400 deg2 , but\nthey increase substantially the sensitivity for field of larger\nsize. Figure 7 shows that Planck sensitivity dominates at\nlarge scale (l < 3000) for field above 2500 deg2 , but that a\nsmaller Herschel field around 400 deg 2 is more optimal at\nmeasuring smaller scale (l > 3000), whereas fields of few\ntens square degree lose a lot of sensitivity in the clustering\npart (1000 < l < 10000) of the FIRB power spectrum due\nto the cosmic variance. The \"optimal\" area (400 deg2 )\ncorresponds to an observation depth of about 51, 66, and\n\n54 mJy (5 \u03c3, only instrumental) at 250, 350, 500 \u03bcm, we\nbelieve this \"optimal\" depth to be robust to a change in\nintegration time, given our shot-noise level estimates.\nAs discussed in Section 3, to estimate the confusion\nassociated with Galactic dust due to the uncertain extragalactic FIRB spectrum, we vary the spectrum based\non uncertainties in Fixsen et al. (1998) spectrum from\nCOBE/FIRAS by drawing 100 simulations assuming uncertainties in the parameters describing the spectrum are\nGaussian distributed (see, Eq. 3). Again, we separate the\nGalactic dust from the FIRB and compute the total signalto-noise ratio. Figure 6 (orange area) shows that the sensitivity to the clustering is degraded by 10% to 35% on\naverage and that the uncertainty on the FIRB spectrum\ngenerates a 10% to 30% uncertainty on the total sensitivity. Even with these uncertainties, the 400 deg2 survey\nremains more sensitive than the few ten square degree surveys. While uncertainties in foreground emission largely\nimpacts the overall signal-to-noise ratio for a detection of\nFIRB anisotropy spectrum, an anisotropy study in a 400\ndeg.2 field is still important given the limited knowledge\nwe have on the unresolved component that accounts for\nup to 90% of the background light at 350 \u03bcm.\n4.2. Astrophysical Information in Unresolved\nAnisotropies\nTo study the extent to which these anisotropy measurements can be used for astrophysical studies, we considered\nextraction of halo model parameters. For this, we assume\na fiducial model for the source distribution and allow vari-\n\n\f9\nations in certain parameters related to this model to study\nhow the likelihood changes. This is done by constructing\nthe Fisher matrix,\n\u001c 2\n\u001d\n\u2202 ln L\nFij = \u2212\n,\n(16)\n\u2202pi \u2202pj X\nwhere L is the likelihood of observing a data set X given\nthe true parameters p1 . . . pn . Since the variance of an unbiased estimator of any parameter pi cannot be less than\nthe Cramer-Rao bound captured by (F\u22121 )ii , the Fisher\nmatrix quantifies the best statistical errors on parameters\npossible with a given data set (Tegmark et al. 1997). We\nrefer the reader to Knox et al. (2001) for a prior application of the Fisher matrix to study how well far-IR background anisotropies can be used to establish properties of\nthe source distribution.\nFor the clustering of unresolved anisotropies, the Fisher\nmatrix becomes\nFij =\n\nlX\nmax\n\nl=lmin\n\n1 \u2202Clclus \u2202Clclus\n,\nXl2 \u2202pi\n\u2202pj\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Xl follows from Equation 15. To establish the relative importance of Herschel given Planck high frequency\nobservations and to get an order-of-magnitude estimate on\nhow well unresolved anisotropies can be used to extract\nsome information on the underlying source distribution,\nwe consider a model with four parameters involving largescale bias factor, small scale occupation number captured\nby the power-law slope \u03b2s , and two parameters to describe\nthe redshift distribution of unresolved sources with fluxes\nfainter than the point source detection. Motivated by the\nredshift distribution predicted by the CLF halo model and\nshown in Fig. 3, we parameterize the redshift distribution\nwith a quadratic function that is zero at z = 0. We calculate the Fisher matrix by varying these four parameters\nand marginalize over the uncertain redshift distribution\nby projecting the 4-dimensional Fisher matrix to two dimensions involving bias and the power-law slope of the\noccupation number.\nIn Figure 8, we show the expected 95% confidence level\nerrors on the slope parameter \u03b2s on the halo occupation\nnumber and the overall bias factor describing the large\nangular scale clustering. To recover the occupation number in detail, clustering measurements at smaller angular\nscales are required to probe the 1-halo part and this is not\npossible with, for example, Planck high frequency data\nalone. As shown in Fig. 5, the required measurements can\nbe easily achieved with Herschel-SPIRE since Planck channels do not have the adequate resolution. Furthermore, the\ncombination of Planck and Herschel over 2500 deg.2 allows\nestimates of the occupation numbers and the bias factor at\nthe level of a few percent at the 95% confidence level even\nafter accounting for the uncertain redshift distribution of\nsources below the point source detection level. For smaller\narea surveys down to the same depth, there is a general\ndegradation on parameter determination with the factor\np\nfsky .\nIn practice, once anisotropy measurements become available, clustering analyses can be improved by combining\nunresolved fluctuations with information from the clustering of resolved sources, number counts, and luminosity\n\nfunctions. The mechanisms to carry out such studies already exist (See example involving 3.6\u03bcm Spitzer data in\nSullivan et al. 2007), but what is now clearly needed is\na survey of required area and sensitivity. Here we have\nshown that a survey of order 103 deg.2 provides maximal\ninformation on the clustering of unresolved fluctuations.\nFinally, it may also be possible to use these anisotropy\nmaps for a weak lensing analysis in the same manner CMB\nmaps are now proposed for lensing studies given the large\nmagnification bias at far-IR wavelengths (e.g., Blain 1998).\nThe same maps can also be extended to cross-correlate\nwith Planck temperature anisotropy data at low frequencies and at large angular scales to detect the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and at small angular scales to detect the CMB lensing-far IR source cross-correlation. The\nlatter lensing-source cross-correlation has been detected\nwith WMAP and NVSS radio survey at the 2\u03c3 confidence\nlevel (Smith et al. 2007), but when Planck data are combined with a wide-survey of Herschel of order 1000 deg2 ,\nthe cross-correlation can be detected at > 20 \u03c3 confidence\nlevel (Song et al. 2003). Once a better understanding\n1/f-noise etc become available, it may be useful to returns\nto these topics to exploit the full information content of\nHerschel.\n5. SUMMARY\n\nBelow the point source detection limit in upcoming\nfar-IR surveys with Planck and Herschel-SPIRE, correlations in the large-scale structure will lead to clustered\nanisotropies in the unresolved component of the far-infrared\nbackground (FIRB). The angular power spectrum of the\nFIRB anisotropies could be measured in these surveys and\nwill be one of the few limited avenues to study some,\nthough limited, information on the faint sources that dominate the background light at these wavelengths.\nTo study the statistical properties of these anisotropies,\nthe confusion from foreground Galactic dust emission\nneeds to be reduced even in the \"cleanest\" regions of the\nsky. The multi-frequency coverage of Planck and HerschelSPIRE instrument allows the foreground dust to be partly\nseparated from the extragalactic background composed of\ndusty starforming galaxies as well as faint normal galaxies.\nThe separation improves for fields with sizes greater than\na few hundred square degrees and when combined with\nPlanck data. Here, we have shown that an area of about \u223c\n400 degrees2 observed for about 1000 hours with HerschelSPIRE and complemented by Planck provides maximal\ninformation on the anisotropy power spectrum.\nAssuming such a survey will be conducted, we have discussed the scientific studies that can be done with measurements of the unresolved FIRB anisotropies including\na few percent accurate determination of the large scale\nbias and the small-scale halo occupation distribution of\nFIRB sources with fluxes below the point-source detection\nlevel. In practice, in addition to the clustering spectrum\nof unresolved anisotropies, measurements such as the luminosity function and the correlation function of resolved\nsources as well as their redshift distribution must be modeled within the same framework. Here, we have provided a\ndetailed outline of such a strategy based on the conditional\nluminosity functions associated with the halo approach to\nlarge-scale structure.\n\n\f10\nAcknowledgments:\nWe thank SPIRE SAG-1 and Open-Time Key Projects\ngroups for useful discussions.
