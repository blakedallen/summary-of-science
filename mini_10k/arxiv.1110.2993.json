Introduction\nVery simple organisms do not age, that is they do not show a deterioration of\nsignificant life functions with age. Instead they seem to simply break, when one\nof their essential functions happens to fail. If such failures occur independently\nwith a constant rate \u03bb \u2013 that is failures follow a Poisson process \u2013 then their corresponding survival function S(t) decays exponentially with time, and lifespans\nare distributed exponentially \u2013 this is just a simple conclusion from mathematical reliability theory and other formally similar processes such as radioactive\ndecay.\n\u2217 corresponding\n\nauthor.

For\nmany different species, it has been empirically established that mortality rates\n\u03bb(t) increase exponentially with time, following the famous empirical GompertzMakeham law of mortality\n\u03bb(t) = \u03bb0 + \u03b1e\u03b2t , \u03bb0 , \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0,\n\n(1)\n\nat least approximately (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 1991) where \u03b1, \u03b2 are constants\nand \u03bb0 the age-independent death rate. Notable deviations are usually for very\nyoung ages t when \"childhood diseases\" lead to higher mortality and also for old\nages where empirically the mortality rate increases slower than exponentially or\neven levels off to a constant value.\nIn this paper we will assume that the driver of ageing, and ultimately death,\nis the accumulation of Ageing Factors (AFs), which for example plays a major\nrole in the ageing of yeast (Sinclair et al., 1998a). We will demonstrate generically that when such AFs are produced in an auto-catalytic or self-reinforcing\nprocess, then Gompertz-Makeham behaviour of the mortality rate follows. Such\nself-reinforcing processes are quite generic, for example in auto-catalytic chemical or biological reactions or also in self-replicating genetic anomalities, and show\ntypically exponential behaviour. The term Ageing Factor (AF) will therefore\ngenerically stand for any substance or anomaly that is thought to cause ageing\nin a specific organism. AFs could come in discrete (even \"macroscopic\") chunks\nor be a continuous quantity. They could be measured in absolute numbers of\nAgeing Factor Units (AFU s) or as a concentration.\nWe proceed as follows: We will firstly take the naive point of view that\ncreation and replication of AFs is a deterministic process and mortality proportional to the abundance of AF. This straight-forwardly leads to an exponentially\nincreasing mortality rate (with no old-age levelling). We then go an and assume\nthat the creation and replication of the AFs are stochastic when the AF comes in\ndiscrete units and in small numbers. If mortality rate is assumed to be proportional to the probability that an organism has an AF abundance above a critical\nlevel, then it follows that the mortality rate increases (more than) exponential\nfor middle ages while it levels off to a constant value at old-ages.\n2. Background\n2.1. Mortality Models\nThe above equation eq. (1) is primarily descriptive and empirically derived\nfrom data, however does not in itself indicate a reason why mortality should\nincrease exponentially with age (at least for middle ages) or any underlying\nmechanism(s) of ageing. However any such mechanism would need to be quite\ngeneral since lifespan of so many different species often surprisingly well fit the\nGompertz-Makeham law. Therefore various attempts have been undertaken to\nground Gompertz-Makeham behaviour in underlying processes that could give\n2\n\n\fan explanation as to why the mortality rate should increase exponentially with\ntime.\nOne prominent such attempt follows Gavrilov and Gavrilova (2001). These\nauthors ground the Gompertz-Makeham (and Weibull) laws in reliability theory.\nTheir basic assumption is that complex organisms have a block of redundant\nfunctional elements for each essential function. Each such element does not age\nand hence fails with a constant rate. The organism as a whole fails (or dies) if\nall redundant elements for a single function have been exhausted. Depending on\nthe number of redundant elements and their failure state at birth, a GompertzMakeham or Weibull law of mortality results. This model of ageing also nicely\nexplains the levelling off of the mortality rate at old ages.\nA second attempt to ground the Gompertz-Makeham law in a biological\nmechanism is Shklovskii (2005) starting from the assumption that the ability of\non organism to neutralise defective cells (or noxious substances for that matter)\nis based on random encounters of these harmful items with some neutralising\nantagonist. If the expected number of such encounters sinks linearly with time,\nagain the Gompertz-Makeham law follows. However no attempt is made to\nexplain old-age longevity or to make plausible why the frequency of such random\nencounters should decrease linearly in time.\nWhile the two models above are individual-based, ie when an individual dies is determined by its life history, there is finally the Penna model\n(Laszkiewicz et al., 2005, Penna, 1995, Stauffer, 2007). This, too, can explain\nan exponentially increasing mortality rate, albeit on a population level. The\nPenna model assumes that genetic defects come to bear at different ages, and\nindividuals die if they have accumulated a certain number of genetic defects \u2013\nin that sense it is similar to ageing in yeast below. However how many defects\nhave been acquired and when they come to bear is predetermined genetically for\neach individual, and only a population equilibrium of individuals with different\ndefective genes leads then to a Gompertzian exponentially increasing mortality\nrate.\n2.2. Ageing in Yeast\nOur approach is motivated by systems that age through accumulating an\nAF. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevesiae) has in this respect been studied extensively and served as model for ageing in higher organisms (Sinclair et al., 1998a).\nAlbeit a single-cell organism, yeast divides asymmetrically, so that mother and\ndaughter cells can be identified. Mothers eventually cease producing daughter\ncells, stall and subsequently die. Extensive experimentation has shown that\nso-called Extra chromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) are a probable cause of ageing (Sinclair and Guarente, 1997). Finally, lifespan of yeast is best measured\nin number of generations, that is how many times a mother cell has already\ndivided. While the absolute time between two such divisions depends on the\nenvironmental conditions, lifespan distribution measured in generational age is\nconstant for different environments.\nAn ERC is a snippet of a repetitive section of chromosomal\nrDeoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) that is excised from the chromosome sponta3\n\n\fneously with a low rate, and subsequently forms an extra-chromosomal DNA\nring. Excision can happen several times independently with approximately constant low rate since the DNA section in question contains about 100 repeats\nof the snippet. As the snippet has its own begin-of-replication sequence, once\nexcised it replicates with a certain probability in each cell cycle \u2013 and hence\nreplicates in a self-reinforcing process.\nAt cell division, the mother cell retains almost all of the ERCs and does\nnot share them \u2013 eg proportional to cell volumes \u2013 with the daughter cells, so\nthat ERCs accumulate in mother cells whereas daughters usually start life free of\nERCs. Cell death then is assumed to occur because replication of a high number\nof ERCs (in the order of 1000) exhausts cell resources needed for replication of\nthe core chromosomal DNA.\nFor very old mother cells ERC retention capability seems to saturate, so\nthat ERCs are shared with daughters, effectively decreasing the mother's ERC\nreplication rate and producing prematurely aged daughters with a reduced\nlife span. Modelling the effects of retention saturation is beyond the scope\nof this paper. From figures discussed in the literature (Gillespie et al., 2004,\nSinclair and Guarente, 1997, Sinclair et al., 1998b), it seems however that the\nreduction in ERC number is minor compared to their absolute number and/or\nrate of replication, so that mothers' lifespans are extended around one or two\ngenerations at most. It does however significantly reduce the expected lifespan\nof daughters of old mothers that have received a portion of the mother's ERCs.\nThe model discussed below can straight-forwardly be modified to take into account birth with a number of ERC but for sake of simplicity we will only deal\nwith populations that start life from a clean ERC-free state as has been the case\nin many experiments (Sinclair and Guarente, 1997).\nExperiments suggest as well that for yeast, cells live on quite happily when\nthey have low or medium numbers of ERCs but die when they have reached a\ncritical level of ERCs so that there does not seem to be a linear increase of mortality rate with number of ERCs as we will naively assume in the deterministic\nmodel. Instead the underlying assumption seems to be that mortality shows an\nincrease at or around a critical number of ERCs (Sinclair et al., 1998b).\nTo\nconclude,\nageing\n(in\nyeast\nand\nother\norganisms,\nSinclair, Mills, and Guarente 1998a) can be caused by an AF that comes\nin discrete chunks and where individuals initially start up with no or a very\nsmall number of such AF. The number of such AF increases due to two\nprocesses: initial creation of such AFs (in yeast by excision from chromosomal\nDNA) and subsequently self-reinforcing replication (for yeast once in the cell\ncycle). Finally mortality is correlated with the abundance of such AFs.\nIn the next section we will present two formalisations of these processes. The\nfirst is naive, straight-forward and deterministic. The second however is more\ncomplicated and based on stochastic processes. This stochastic model serves\nalso to justify the naive approach. These approaches are certainly motivated by\nthe experimental data for yeast, but we will formulate them quite generally as\nauto-catalytic processes are an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, thus might\nwell play a role in ageing processes in many organisms.\n4\n\n\f3. Models\nLet c(t) denote the abundance of an AF at time t. The abundance could\neither stand for the (discrete) absolute number of Ageing Factor Units (AFU\ns) if the AF comes in discrete chunks and absolute numbers are low, or for\na (continuous) concentration if absolute numbers are high or the factor itself\nis a continuous variable. We shall assume that c(t) changes in time due to\ntwo processes: 1. Creation with rate p(t), ie new AFU s come into existence\nindependently of existing ones. This could be from internal processes such as a\nproduct of a chemical or metabolic reaction or the excision of snippets of DNA\nas in yeast, but also external such as a DNA defects due to UV light and so\non. 2. Replication with rate r(t), ie once some AFU s have been acquired there\nis an auto-catalytic process that produces more AFU s, linearly depending on\nthe abundance c(t) of AF already present, ie \u2206c(t) \u223c c(t). Typical examples of\nsuch processes are auto-catalytic chemical reactions where the product at the\nsame time is also an educt of the reaction, or the replication of a DNA snippet\nindependently of the core genome as happens with the ERCs in yeast. These\nprocesses could be happening in continuous or discrete time, on an absolute time\nscale or tied to an internal time scale. For yeast for example, ERC replication\nis synchronised with the cell cycle.\n3.1. Deterministic Production of AFs\nAs it is simpler and instructive, we first consider the case where the AF comes\nin large quantities in each individual and creation and replication processes have\nhigh rates. This means that while individual creation and replication may well\nbe stochastic, we can assume \u2013 due to the high rates and high numbers of AF\ninvolved \u2013 that creation and replication proceed deterministically, and variations\nof AF around its instantaneous mean are negligible.\nWe will in addition assume continuous time. Mathematical argument is often\neasier in continuous time than in discrete time, and the inaccuracies incurred\nby transforming equations between discrete time and continuous time are small\nwhen the involved quantities are smooth.\nFormalising creation and replication processes in continuous time, c(t) follows an inhomogeneous linear Ordindary Differential Equation (ODE):\ndc(t)\n= r(t)c(t) + p(t)\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwith solution for initial value c(0) = c0 (see Appendix A):\nc(t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\np(\u03c4 )e\n\nRt\n\u03c4\n\nr(\u03c4 \u2032 )d\u03c4 \u2032\n\nd\u03c4 + c0 e\n\nRt\n0\n\nr(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nc(t), p(t), r(t) are non-negative functions, and it is obvious that c(t) increases\nessentially exponentially with t when r(t) > 0. For discrete time, c(t) would be\nthe solution of a similar difference equation which again increases exponentially\n(geometrically) in time.\n5\n\n\fFor simplicity let us assume r(t) = r and p(t) = p are constant, so that both\ncreation and replication processes of AF do not change with time, and eq. (3)\nsimplifies to\np\nc(t) = (ert \u2212 1) + c0 ert\n(4)\nr\nHowever time-varying r(t) and p(t) could also easily be accommodated and\nwould not essentially change the arguments belows.\nIf we assume the death is only due to the AF, then a natural assumption is\nthat the mortality rate is proportional to c(t), ie:\n\u03bb(t) = zc(t), z > 0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere z is the proportionality factor. Then quite straight-forwardly, inserting\neq. (4) into eq. (5) provides a Gompertzian time development of t with some\nadditional terms to adapt to initial conditions. For higher t, \u03bb(t) increases\nexponentially with t, and does not level off to a constant value either for very\nhigh t.\n3.2. Example: Lifespan of Yeast\nExperimental data is often in the form of lifespan distributions rather than\nmortality rate per se. The lifespan distribution is given by the survival function\nS(t) which is the probability that an individual survives at least until t. It is\nrelated to the mortality rate \u03bb(t) via the following ODE with initial condition\nS(0) = 1:\ndS(t)\n= \u2212\u03bb(t)S(t).\n(6)\ndt\nThis is again of the form as in Appendix A and inserting eq. (4) and eq. (5)\nand solving for S(t) (see eq. (B.2)) we get:\nS(t) = e\u2212\n\nRt\n0\n\n\u03bb(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n\n=e\n\n\u2212 zp\nr\n\nh\n\nert \u22121\n\u2212t\nr\n\ni\n\ne\u2212\n\nzc0\nr\n\n[ert \u22121] .\n\n(7)\n\nThis form of S(t) can now straight-forwardly be fitted to experimental data, see\nfig. 1.\nAs p and c0 do not enter eq. (7) independently of z, their absolute value\ncannot be estimated from data unless further biological assumptions are taken\ninto account. r can be seen as the average or effective rate of increase of the\nAF. The fit is surprisingly good even though it does not take into account the\nlevelling of the mortality rate \u03bb(t) observed for many species for high t so it\nunderestimates the frequency of very high lifespans.\n3.3. Stochastic Production of AFs\nWhile eq. (7) often yields a good fit as we have seen, it starts from the\nassumption that the AF comes in high numbers with high rates p and r, so\nthat the process of AF is largely deterministic. The deterministic model does\nalso not account for the levelling off of mortality rate with time. For example\nfor yeast it is however known that the AF comes only in discrete units and\n6\n\n\f1\nExperiment\nDeterministic Model\n\n0.8\n\nP(t)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nAge t\n\nFigure 1: Fitting the survival curve of yeast: A least squares fit for p\u2032 := zp and r of eq.

Note the (expected) underestimation of old-age longevity.\n\nindividuals acquire them one by one, and numbers stay smallish throughout\nlife-time. All this does not warrant a deterministic approach. Hence for such\ndiscrete AFs in small numbers, creation and replication should be treated as\nstochastic processes. For simplicity of argument here, we will assume discrete\ntime in the following.\nThe stochastic creation process of discrete AFU s is easily modelled as a\n(constant or varying rate) Poisson or Bernoulli process, so for constant rate p\nthe expected number of AFU increases as pt with variance pt. In the following\nwe will assume that p is constant. This is simpler and there is also no biological\nindication to contrary.\nThe replication process is more complicated and best be described in the\nframework of branching processes (Haccou et al., 2005), a type of stochastic\nprocess suited to model growth processes. We will first look at a pure branching\nprocess that corresponds to the stochastic AFU replication in isolation, and\nsubsequently combine replication and creation processes.\nIn the following capital letters such as X denote random variables. Pr(*)\ndenotes the probability (density) of an event, E(*) and Var(*) the expectation\nvalue and variance of a random variable respectively. For further background\n\u2013 such as relations of conditional expectations and variances or approximations\nof the Q- and erf-function \u2013 we refer the reader to good textbooks with an\nintroduction to probability theory, for example Cover and Thomas (1991) or\nHaccou et al. (2005).\n7\n\n\f3.4. Replication Process Only\nIn this section we concentrate on the replication process per se, and assume\nthat initially one AFU is already present: c(0) = 1. Then existing AFU s\nreplicate with mean rate r in each time step. This means each single AFU\nat t gives rise to one (itself) or two AFU s (itself and its replication) at t + 1\nwith probabilities 1 \u2212 r and r respectively. Formally individual replication is a\nrandom variable \u039e with probabilities Pr(\u039e = 1) = 1 \u2212 r and Pr(\u039e = 2) = r, and\nall other outcomes have probability zero, and we define short symbols for mean\nand variance of the number of successors of a single AFU : m := E(\u039e) = 1 + r\nand s2 := V ar(\u039e) = r(1 \u2212 r).\nAs the replication process itself is random, also the abundance of the population c(t) at time t is a random variable and \u2013 to mark that the abundance\nis now a random variable in discrete time \u2013 we replace symbol c(t) with Ct and\ncall it the population size.\nIn fact, the sequence of (Ct ) forms a branching process (see Appendix C)\nand Ct is the Ct\u22121 -fold sum of the individual replication process \u039e (with i.i.d.\noutcomes; we refrain from distinguishing the individual \u039e in order not to overPCt\u22121\nburden the notation): Ct = i=1\n\u039e. The expectation value \u03bc(t) := E(\u039e) and\nvariance \u03c3 2 (t) := V ar(Ct ) of the population sizes Ct then follow from expectation value and variance of individual offspring \u039e as (see Appendix C):\n\u03bc(t) = mt ,\n\n\u03c3 2 (t) = s2\n\nmt (mt \u2212 1)\nm(m \u2212 1)\n\n(8)\n\nwith the initial condition that we start from a single AFU at t = 0, ie C0 = 1.\nIn the case of deterministic growth, the mortality rate \u03bb(t) was assumed\nproportional to c(t). We could in principle also here set \u03bb(t) \u223c E(Ct ) = mt\nwith the same results as above, loosing again the levelling off of \u03bb(t) for old\nages. Experiments indicate that for yeast, cells with a relative low number of\nERCs do not have an altered instantaneous mortality rate from cells with no\nERCs. The mortality rate seems to increase only when the number of ERCs\nhas reached a critical level. Hence in this stochastic process setting, it is more\nnatural to assume that the mortality rate \u03bb(t) is proportional to the probability\nthat an individual has more AFU s Ct than a fixed critical level c\u2020 , ie\n\u03bb(t) = z Pr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ), z > 0.\n\n(9)\n\nThis agrees also with the type of mortality criteria used in computer simulations\nof ageing processes (Gillespie et al., 2004). More complicated dependencies are\nof course possible, but would typically show a similar dependency on an upper\nquantile of Ct .\nIn order to calculate \u03bb(t) explicitly, we would need to know the distribution of\nCt for all times t. To our knowledge this problem has not been solved explicitly.\nWe can however make a series of approximations for small times t, large times t\nand middle times t to demonstrate that this setting for the mortality rate \u03bb(t)\nyields Gompertz-Makeham behaviour for middle t and a constant mortality for\nvery old ages.\n8\n\n\fSmall t. We assume that at time t = 0 there is one AFU , C0 = 1. As each\nAFU can have at most two successors (itself and its offspring), we know that\nfor t < log(c\u2020 )/log(2), Pr(Ct \u2265 c0 ) = 0. So depending on c\u2020 there will be more\nor less long an initial period for which the mortality rate is zero.\nApproximation with normal distribution. Generally the precise form of Pr(Ct )\nis not known. Knowing only its \u03bc(t) and \u03c3(t) we assume that Ct follows approximately a normal distribution with mean \u03bc(t) and variance \u03c3 2 (t). This is\nplausible as Ct ultimately in our setting is a sum of binomial distributions (each\nindividual either replicates or not and survives itself into the next generation,\nso Ct+1 = Ct + B(Ct , r)) which themselves can be approximated by a normal\ndistribution \u2013 however the Ct are not independent. Also quantities related to\nCt such as Pr(Ct |Ct\u22121 ) have been shown to approximate a normal distribution\n(Quine and Szczotka, 1994). Hence for mildly large t we approximate:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nc\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(t)\n1 1\nc\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(t)\nPr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ) \u2248 Q\n(10)\n= \u2212 erf \u221a\n\u03c3(t)\n2 2\n2\u03c3(t)\np\nwhere Q(x) = 1/2 \u2212 1/2 erf(x/ (2)) is the Q-function that gives the mass of\na standard normal distribution above x (ie the probability of getting a value\nlarger than x).\nLarge t \u226b 0. For large very large t \u226b 0,\n\n1\nc\u2020 \u2212 mt\nc\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(t)\n=\u2212\n= lim q t t\nt\u2192\u221e\nt\u2192\u221e\nm (m \u22121)\n\u03c3(t)\ns\ns\nlim\n\n(11)\n\nm(m\u22121)\n\nas both \u03bc(t), \u03c3(t) grow exponentially with the same rate. Hence\nlim \u03bb(t) = Q(\u22121/s) > 0,\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(12)\n\nie the mortality rate \u03bb(t) levels off with age to a constant positive value, hence\n\u03bb(t) shows the experimentally observed old-age deviation from the GompertzMakeham law.\nMiddle t. We have established that \u03bb(t) = 0 for small t and \u2248 const > 0 for\nlarge t. As each AFU survives into the next time step, Ct+1 \u2265 Ct , ie the\nnumber of AFU s is non-decreasing. This means that \u03bb(t) = z Pr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ) is\nnon-decreasing as well. Hence \u03bb(t) has roughly the form of a (discrete) sigmoid.\nIf approximation of Ct with a normal distribution is valid also for middle\nt such that 0 \u226a \u03bc(t) < c\u2020 , where P (Ct > c\u2020 ) > 0 but the expected number\n\u03bc(t) = mt still less than the critical value c\u2020 , we go on to show that increase of\n\u03bb(t) must be steeper than mt , in other words we have an exponential growth of\nthe mortality rate for intermediate ages.\nIf x := c\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(t)/\u03c3 is not too close to zero, ie \u03bc(t) still much smaller than\n1 2\n1\ne\u2212 2 x for x > 0 and hence\nc\u2020 , then Q(x) \u2248 \u221a2\u03c0x\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(c \u2212\u03bc(t))2\n\u03c3t\nc\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(y)\n\u2212 \u2020\u03c32 (t)\ne\n\u2248 \u221a\n\u03bb(t) \u2248 Q\n.\n(13)\n\u03c3(t)\n2\u03c0(c\u2020 \u2212 \u03bc(t))\n9\n\n\fFor c\u2020 > \u03bc(t), the exponential is increasing towards 1. The denominator of\nthe pre-factor is decreasing,\nand its numerator increasing exponentially approxq\nm (m \u22121)\nt\nimately as mt (since\nm(m\u22121) \u2248 m for not too small t). Hence there are\nintermediate t for which \u03bb(t) approximately increases more than exponentially:\nt\n\nt\n\n\u03bb(t) & zmt\n\n(14)\n\n3.5. Creation and Replication\nUnless born out of very old mother cells, new-born yeast cell usually do not\nhave any ERC, ie Ct = 0 so creation and replication process need to interact to\ncause ageing. Before replication of AFU s can start, first some must be produced,\nie we have a combination of two stochastic processes. This combination is more\ncumbersome to deal with, but we demonstrate below that (asymptotic) growth\nrates of E(Ct ) and Var(Ct ) are unaltered, so that the same approximations and\nasymptotic considerations are valid for this more complicated process as were\nin the case of replication only.\nLet Ct denote the AFU population size as before, and \u039e again the individual\nAFU replication process with the same distribution. Finally let Xt be the\ncreation process with constant rate p, ie Pr(Xt = 0) = 1\u2212p and Pr(Xt = 1) = p.\nThen E(X) = p and Var(X) = p(1 \u2212 p).\nThe random number Ct+1 of AFU at time t + 1 is then the sum of the\nPCt\nreplication of the previous number of AFU s i=1\n\u039e plus the number Xt of\nnewly created AFU s:\nCt\nX\n\u039e + Xt\n(15)\nCt+1 =\ni=1\n\nUtilising independence of the individual \u039e and Xt we can calculate a recursive\nequation for E(Ct ) as in the case above, see Appendix D:\nE(Ct+1 ) = m E(Ct ) + E(Xt )\n\n(16)\n\nwith explicit solution for initial value C0 = 0:\nE(Ct ) =\n\np\n(mt \u2212 1).\nm\u22121\n\n(17)\n\nComparison of (16) and (17) with (2) and (4) also makes it clear that the process\nCt is the stochastic time-discrete analogue to the deterministic continuous time\nequation in section 3.1 (with r = log(m)).\nLikewise a recursive formula for Var(Ct ) can be obtained:\nVar(Ct+1 ) = m2 Var(Ct ) + s2 E(Ct ) + Var(Xt ).\n\n(18)\n\nThis has a rather tedious explicit solution, see Appendix D. For large t however\nit is clear from the dependency of Var(Ct ) on Var(Ct\u22121 ) and because E(Ct ) only\ngrows like mt for large t, that the growth of Var(Ct ) will asymptotically be like\nm2t . Ie both Var(Ct ) and E(Ct ) grow asymptotically as in the case before.\n10\n\n\fHence again under the assumption that Ct can be approximated well enough\nwith a normal distribution, the same considerations as above for small, middle\nand large follow, ie \u03bb(t) = 0 for small t, \u03bb & zmt for middle t and \u03bb(t) constant\nfor large t.\n4. Discussion\nThe production processes and death criteria considered in this paper arise\nfrom experimental observation of ageing in yeast mother cells where ERCs seem\nto be drivers of ageing and death. It is remarkable indeed that the deterministic equation eq. (7) already yields such a good fit with experimental data,\neven though the underlying process model is deterministic, uses a non-biological\ndeath criterion and finally does not take any detailed properties of the underlying AF production processes into account such as sharing of ERCs between\nold mothers and daughters. It only relies on the exponential accumulation of\nAFs. The model does not take into account either that ageing in yeast need not\nnecessarily only take place through accumulation of ERC.\nIn the stochastic model, we have demonstrated that the mortality rate increases with time roughly like a discrete sigmoid and \u03bb(t) & zmt = zert, r =\nlog(m) for middle t. The good fit of an exponential mortality rate with data\n(eg in fig. 1) shows that usually \u03bb(t) does not increase significantly faster than\nexponentially or that such faster increase has no significant effect on the form\nof the survival function. If we do not care about the overestimation of mortality\nold ages, we can extend the exponential approximation of \u03bb(t) also to greater\nt. Finally we know that Pr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ) = 0 strictly for young ages. Extending the\napproximation of Ct with a normal distribution also to these young ages would\nlead to a Pr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ) > 0. However as then also c\u2020 \u226b m(t) this is often negligibly small (and would for example be masked by a constant age-independent\ndeath rate \u03bb0 ). Hence the deterministic approach \u03bb(t) \u223c ert can be justified for\nall ages t as an approximation of the stochastic approach \u03bb(t) \u223c Pr(Ct \u2265 c\u2020 ).\nGillespie et al. (2004) set out to understand ageing in yeast with the help of\nnumeric computer simulations. Essentially they simulated a stochastic process\nsuch as in section 3.5. Their simulation also modelled the old-age ERC sharing\nbetween mothers and daughters. Simulation parameters, such as replication\nrate r or excision rate p were estimated from data in the literature. With these\nestimated parameters, their simulation yielded a fairly good fit which however\nwas not quantified. The best fit was achieved by assuming that p(t) \u223c t2 , ie\na non-constant creation rate which seems to be an ad-hoc choice to improve\nthe fit over a constant excision rate. In light of the good fit of eq. (7) which\nwas derived with a constant p, it is quite surprising that Gillespie et al. did not\nobtain a good fit under the same assumption.\nFinally the rate with which ERCs in yeast are replicated has been estimated\nas about m = 1.6 (Sinclair and Guarente, 1997) \u2013 this follows as an average rate\nfrom an average lifespan of 15 generations once the first ERC has been acquired\nand a critical level in the order of 1000, as m \u2248 10001/15 = 1.585 and hence\nr = log 1.59 \u2248 0.46, this is about twice the r estimated from the data in fig. 1.\n11\n\n\fLast but not least, eq. (7) and its good fit to the data also confirm quantitatively a qualitative conjecture of Sinclair et al. (1998b), namely that the\nsurvival function for yeast is a \"sum\" of a decay process (due to excision) and\nsubsequent exponential accumulation of ERCs, albeit the combination of these\ntwo process is a more involved sum than Sinclair et al. implied, namely that of\ntwo stochastic processes in eq. (15).\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have demonstrated that mortality rates similar to those in\nthe Gompertz-Makeham law can be derived when we assume an AF is produced\nin an auto-catalytic process. Such processes in turn lead to an exponential (or\nsynonymously geometric) increase of the abundance of AFs. In the case of\ndeterministic production of AFs, with mortality assumed proportional to the\nAF abundance a plain Gompertz-Makeham law follows with the usual underestimation of longevity for old ages. In the stochastic case, not only does a\nGompertz-Makeham law follow, but also the levelling off of mortality rates is\nderived if mortality is assumed proportional to the probability that an individual\nhas reached a critical level of AFs.\nAll in all the paper establishes a useful and interesting relation between\nmortality rates that follow a Gompertz-Makeham law and an underlying autocatalytic process. For yeast ageing driven by ERCs the model and data are in\nqualitative agreement. However discrepancies between the rate of replication\nestimated here and within other experimental contexts need to be examined.\nThe derived relation is general and applicable to all organisms where ageing\nis based on exponential accumulation of an AF \u2013 this nicely contrasts and complements Gavrilov and Gavrilova's approach (2001) for which ageing is based\non the exhaustion of parallel redundant functional elements.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Colin S.

General Linear ODE\nIn the present paper the linear inhomogeneous ODE plays are role:\ndx(t)\n= a(t)x(t) + b(t)\ndt\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere a(t) can be thought of as a time-variant rate of growth of x(t) and b(t)\nas a time-variant external influx to x(t). The generic solution can be obtained\n\u2013 under some smoothness assumptions \u2013 for example using the Green's function\napproach. We refer the reader to a generic textbook on ODEs and just state\n12\n\n\fthe generic solution below. The reader can check the correctness of the solution\nthrough differentiating with respect to t and inserting into eq. (A.1).\nIn the homogeneous case, i.e. b(t) = 0, the general solution of eq. (A.1) with\ninitial value x(0) = x0 is\nRt\nx(t) = x0 e 0 a(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 .\n(A.2)\nIn the inhomogeneous case b(t) 6= 0, the general solution with initial value\nx(t) = x0 is:\nZ t\nRt\nRt\n\u2032\n\u2032\nx(t) =\np(\u03c4 )e \u03c4 r(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 d\u03c4 + x0 e 0 r(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n(A.3)\n0\n\nFor example if a(t) = a, b(t) = b are constant and x(0) = 0 the solution is:\nx(t) =\n\nb at\n(e \u2212 1)\na\n\n(A.4)\n\nAppendix B. Lifespans and mortality rate\nLet \u03bb(t) be the instantaneous mortality (or failure) rate, ie the rate with\nwhich an individual dies/fails at t, then is it related to the distribution of lifespans or survival function S(t) (ie the probability for an individual to survive\nuntil time t) via:\ndS(t)\n= \u2212\u03bb(t)S(t)\n(B.1)\ndt\nwith initial condition S(0) = 1. This equation is of the form of eq. (A.1), hence\nsolved for S(t) we obtain:\nS(t) = e\u2212\n\nRt\n0\n\n\u03bb(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\n\n.\n\n(B.2)\n\nIf we have independent processes that cause death with rates \u03bb1 (t) and\n\u03bb2 (t) and corresponding survival functions S1 (t), S2 (t) and combine them as\n\u03bb(t) = c1 \u03bb1 (t) + c2 \u03bb2 (t), then due to linearity of integration and because the\nexponential transfers sums into products:\nS(t) = S1c1 (t)S2c2 (t).\n\n(B.3)\n\nThis is handy when dealing with different terms in a complex \u03bb(t) separately.\nFor example adding constant age independent mortality rate \u03bb0 to a \u03bb(t) means\nthat the corresponding S(t) acquires an additional factor e\u2212\u03bb0 t .\nAppendix C. Branching Processes\nIntuitively a branching processes is a model for stochastic reproduction of\nindividuals in discrete time and follows the population size Ct in time. Each\nindividual lives for one time step (or generation), and produces a number of\noffspring according to a random variable (rv) \u039e with mean of m := E(\u039e) and\nvariance s2 := Var(\u039e) according to a fixed probability distribution. Given the\n13\n\n\fpopulation size Ct , the number of individuals in the next generation Ct+1 is\na random number that is the sum of all offspringsPproduced randomly and\nCt\nindependently by all individuals in Ct , ie Ct+1 =\ni=0 \u039e. The sequence of\n(Ct )t\u22650 forms a stochastic process, ie a sequence of interdependent random\nvariables (Haccou et al., 2005).\nLet E(X) denote the expectation value of a random variable X and Pr(X)\nand Var(X) its probability and variance. For given expectation m of an individual's offspring and initial population C0 = 1, one can then calculate\nthe expectation values \u03bc(t) := E(Ct ) of expected population sizes. Since\nPCt\nE(\u039e) = mCt it follows:\nE(Ct+1 |Ct ) = i=i\n\u03bc(t + 1) = E(Ct+1 ) = E(E(Ct+1 |Ct )) =\n\nE(mCt ) = m E(Ct\u22121 ). (C.1)\n\nUtilising this recursiveness, it follows with initial value C0 = 1:\n\u03bc(t) = mt .\n\n(C.2)\n\nA similar but more lengthy argument yields (see for example\nHaccou, Jagers, and Vatutin 2005) or compare to the more complex argument below for eq. (D.8))\n\u03c3 2 (t) := Var(Ct ) = s2\n\nmt (mt \u2212 1)\n.\nm(m \u2212 1)\n\n(C.3)\n\nFor t \u226b 0, this can be approximated as\n\u03c3 2 (t) \u2248 s2 m2t\n\n(C.4)\n\nHence for a branching process expectation \u03bc(t) and its standard deviation \u03c3(t)\nboth increase exponentially with mt .\n\"Individuals\" and \"offspring\" in a branching process as above can correspond\nto \"individuals\" in the biological sense but also to other discrete units that\nreproduce. In the main text, an individual is an AFU that reduplicates with\nprobability r in a time step and also survives into the next time step with\ncertainty. An individual AFU then has either one (itself, no replication) or two\nsuccessors (itself and its replication), ie individual reproduction \u039e into the next\ntime step is governed by the following probability distribution:\nPr(\u039e = 1) = (1 \u2212 r),\n\nPr(\u039e = 2) = r\n\n(C.5)\n\nand probabilities for all other outcomes zero. The individual reproduction process \u039e then has mean m = 1 + r and variance s2 = r(1 \u2212 r). Note that this\nbranching process cannot die out (Pr(Ct > 0, \u2200t) = 1), as there is at least one\nsuccessor for each individual (ie Pr(\u039e \u2265 1) = 1). In fact the process will be\nnon-decreasing Ct+1 \u2265 Ct .\n\n14\n\n\fAppendix D. Combined Production Process\nThe full stochastic production process of AFU s is the combination of a\nstandard Galton-Watson branching process that governs AFU replication and\na Bernoulli process (a discrete time Poisson process) that governs AFU creation.\nLet Ct denote the population size at t, and \u039e the individual AFU replication\nprocess with mean E(\u039e) = m and variance Var(\u039e) = s2 as before. Let further\nXt be the Bernoulli creation process with constant rate p, ie Pr(Xt = 0) = 1 \u2212 p\nand Pr(Xt = 1) = p. Then E(Xt ) = p and Var(Xt ) = p(1 \u2212 p) at each time\nstep. The process we are interested in is given by the sequence of recursively\ndefined random variables Ct\nCt+1 =\n\nCt\nX\n\n\u039e + Xt .\n\n(D.1)\n\ni=1\n\nUtilising independence of the individual \u039es and Xt we can calculate a recursive\nequation for E(Ct ). First we note that\nE(Ct+1 |Ct ) =\n\nCt\nX\n\nE(\u039e) + E(Xt ) = Ct m + p.\n\n(D.2)\n\ni=1\n\nThen making use of E(A) = E(E(A|B) it follows:\nE(Ct+1 ) = E(E(Ct+1 |Ct ) = m E(Ct ) + p.\n\n(D.3)\n\nWith initial condition C0 = E(C0 ) = 0 this can be resolved in closed form:\nE(Ct ) =\n\np\n(mt \u2212 1).\nm\u22121\n\n(D.4)\n\nConsequentially E(Ct ) increases with mt for large t. For the variance, we set\nP t\nZt := C\ni=1 , hence Ct+1 = Zt + Xt and utilising again the independence of Zt\nand Xt :\nVar(Ct+1 ) = Var(Zt ) + Var(Xt )\n(D.5)\nand further using the variance partitioning formula Var(A) = E(Var(A|B)) +\nVar(E(A|B):\nVar(Zt ) = E(Var(Zt |Ct )) + Var(E(Zt |Ct ))\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= E(Ct s ) + Var(mCt ) = s E(Ct ) + m Var(Ct ),\n\n(D.6)\n(D.7)\n\nand hence we get the recursive formula:\nVar(Ct+1 ) = m2 Var(Ct ) + s2 E(Ct ) + Var(Xt ).\n\n(D.8)\n\nWe have already a closed solution for E(Ct ). Inserting eq. (17) into (D.8) we\n(or rather maxima with some subsequent manual simplification) can solve this\n\n15\n\n\ffor Var(Ct ) with initial condition Var(C0 ) = 0 (from C0 = 0):\n\u0010\n1 \u2212 m\u22122t\nVar(Ct ) = m2t p(1 \u2212 p) 2\nm \u22121\n+ ps2\n\n\u0011\n1 \u2212 m\u2212t\n1 \u2212 m\u22122t\n2\n\u2212\nps\n(D.9)\nm(m \u2212 1)2\n(m \u2212 1)(m2 \u2212 1)\n\nThis is rather cumbersome, and we refrain from further simplification as it is\nobvious that for t \u2192 \u221e Var(Ct ) \u223c m2t . As also this Ct is non-decreasing,\nthe same argumentation as in section 3.4 can be applied to the full process in\nsection 3.5.\nReferences\nCover, T. M., Thomas, J. A., 1991.
