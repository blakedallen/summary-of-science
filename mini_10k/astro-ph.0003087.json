Beers\nDepartment of Physics & Astronomy, Michigan State University, E. Lansing, MI 48824\nemail: beers@pa.msu.edu\nABSTRACT\nWe present a detailed analysis of the space motions of 1203 solar-neighborhood\nstars with metal abundances [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.6, on the basis of a recently revised and\nsupplemented catalog of metal-poor stars selected without kinematic bias (Beers et al.\n2000). This sample, having available proper motions, radial velocities, and distance\nestimates for stars with a wide range of metal abundances, is by far the largest such\ncatalog to be assembled to date.\nWe show that the stars in our sample with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2, which likely represent\na \"pure\" halo component, are characterized by a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (141 \u00b1 11, 106 \u00b1 9, 94 \u00b1 8) km s\u22121 and small prograde rotation\n< V\u03c6 >= 30 to 50 km s\u22121 , consistent with previous analysis of this sample based\non radial velocity information alone (Beers & Sommer-Larsen 1995). In contrast to\nthe previous analysis, we find a decrease in < V\u03c6 > with increasing distance from\nthe Galactic plane for stars which are likely to be members of the halo population\n(\u2206 < V\u03c6 > /\u2206|Z| = \u221252 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ), which may represent the signature of a\ndissipatively formed flattened inner halo.\nUnlike essentially all previous kinematically selected catalogs, the metal-poor stars\nin our sample exhibit a diverse distribution of orbital eccentricities, e, with no apparent\ncorrelation between [Fe/H] and e. This demonstrates, clearly and convincingly, that\nthe evidence offered by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, and Sandage (1962) for a rapid collapse of\nthe Galaxy, an apparent correlation between the orbital eccentricity of halo stars with\nmetallicity, is basically the result of their proper-motion selection bias. However, even\nin our non-kinematically selected sample, we have identified a small concentration of\nhigh-e stars at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7, which may originate, in part, from infalling gas during\nthe early formation of the Galaxy.\nWe find no evidence for an additional thick disk component for stellar abundances\n[Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2. The kinematics of the intermediate-abundance stars close to the\nGalactic plane are, in part, affected by the presence of a rapidly rotating thick\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ndisk component with < V\u03c6 >\u2243 200 km s\u22121 (with a vertical velocity gradient on\nthe order of \u2206 < V\u03c6 > /\u2206|Z| = \u221230 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ), and velocity ellipsoid\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (46 \u00b1 4, 50 \u00b1 4, 35 \u00b1 3) km s\u22121 . The fraction of low-metallicity stars in\nthe solar neighborhood which are members of the thick disk population is estimated as\n\u223c 10% for \u22122.2 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.7 and \u223c 30% for \u22121.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121. We obtain an\nestimate of the radial scale length of the metal-weak thick disk of 4.5 \u00b1 0.6 kpc.\nWe also analyze the global kinematics of the stars constituting the halo component\nof the Galaxy. The outer part of the halo, which we take to be represented by\nlocal stars on orbits reaching more than 5 kpc from the Galactic plane, exhibits no\nsystematic rotation. In particular, we show that previous suggestions of the presence\nof a \"counter-rotating high halo\" are not supported by our analysis. The density\ndistribution of the outer halo is nearly spherical, and exhibits a power-law profile that\nis accurately described as \u03c1 \u221d R\u22123.55\u00b10.13 . The inner part of the halo is characterized\nby a prograde rotation and a highly flattened density distribution. We find no distinct\nboundary between the inner and outer halo.\nWe confirm the clumping in angular-momentum phase space of a small number of\nlocal metal-poor stars noted by Helmi et al. (1999). We also identify an additional\nelongated feature in angular-momentum phase space extending from the clump to\nregions with high azimuthal rotation. The number of members in the detected clump\nis not significantly increased from that reported by Helmi et al., even though the\ntotal number of the sample stars we consider is almost triple that of the previous\ninvestigation. We conclude that the fraction of halo stars that may have arisen from\nthe precursor object of this clump may be smaller than 10% of the present Galactic\nhalo, as previously suggested.\nThe implications of our results for the formation of the Galaxy are discussed,\nin particular in the context of the currently favored Cold Dark Matter theory of\nhierarchical galaxy formation.\n\nSubject headings: Galaxy: evolution \u2013 Galaxy: halo - Galaxy: abundances - Stars:\nPopulation II\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past few decades, studies of the luminous halo population of metal-deficient field\nstars and globular clusters have provided an increasingly detailed picture of the formation\nand evolution of the Galaxy. Because the time required for mixing of the initial phase-space\ndistribution of these objects, via exchange of energies and angular momenta, is thought to exceed\nthe age of the Galaxy, kinematic information obtained at the present enables one to elucidate the\ninitial dynamical conditions under which these objects were born. To the extent one is able to\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nestimate ages of these halo population objects, either directly (which is difficult at present), or\nindirectly (by postulating that the ensemble metallicities of these objects increases with time),\ntheir formation history is obtainable as well. Thus, the dynamical and chemical state of these\nhalo-population objects provides important information on how the Galaxy has developed its\ncharacteristic structures during the course of its evolution.\nAlmost forty years ago, the \"canonical\" scenario of the early dynamical evolution of the\nGalaxy was put forward by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage (1962, hereafter ELS) to explain\nwhat they believed to be an observed correlation between the orbital characteristics and metal\nabundances of stars in the solar neighborhood. Focusing on the lack of metal-poor stars with low\neccentricity orbits in their (proper-motion selected) sample, ELS argued that the Galaxy must\nhave undergone a rapid collapse, then formed a rotationally supported disk. Although criticism of\nthe ELS model has been levied because of the potential influence of their kinematic selection bias,\nespecially the extent to which this might alter the derived collapse timescale of the early Galaxy\n(Yoshii & Saio 1979; Norris, Bessell, & Pickles 1985; Norris 1986; Norris & Ryan 1991; Beers\n& Sommer-Larsen 1995, hereafter BSL; Chiba & Yoshii 1998, hereafter CY), the ELS collapse\npicture has long been influential for studies of disk galaxies like our own, and for elliptical galaxies\nas well (e.g., Larson 1974; van Albada 1982).\nAn alternative picture for the formation of the Galactic halo was proposed by Searle & Zinn\n(1978, hereafter SZ), who noted a number of difficulties in reconciling several observed properties\nof the halo globular cluster system with predictions of the ELS model. Among these, the existence\nof a large (several Gyr) spread in the inferred ages of the Galactic globulars, and the lack of an\nabundance gradient with distance from the Galactic center were thought to be the most crucial.\nSZ suggested that, in its earliest epochs, the halo component of the Galaxy may have experienced\nprolonged, chaotic accretion of subgalactic fragments. More recent studies of halo field stars also\nprovide evidence which may support the SZ picture, including a possible age spread among halo\nsubdwarfs (e.g., Schuster & Nissen 1989; Carney et al. 1996), a gradient in the inferred ages of\nfield horizontal-branch (FHB) stars and RR Lyrae variables, in the sense that the outer halo FHB\nstars and RR Lyrae variables appear several Gyr younger than those of the inner halo (Preston,\nShectman, & Beers 1991; Lee & Carney 1999), a report of the apparent clustering of FHB stars\nin the halo (Doinidis & Beers 1989), possible kinematic substructure in the halo (e.g., Doinidis &\nBeers 1989; Majewski, Munn, & Hawley 1994; 1996), and distinct changes in the kinematics of\nthe field populations as one moves from the inner to outer halo (e.g., Majewski 1992; Carney et\nal. 1996; Sommer-Larsen et al. 1997).\nIn order to assess which picture, ELS or SZ (or both, e.g., Norris 1994; Freeman 1996; Carney\net al. 1996), more correctly describes the early history of the Galaxy, we require a large and\nreliable set of data for halo-population objects chosen with criteria that do not unduly influence\nthe subsequent analysis. As we show, the analysis of stars chosen with a kinematic selection bias\ncan be particularly troublesome. Interestingly, in order to obtain adequately large samples of\nstars exhibiting a range of metallicities in the solar neighborhood, an abundance bias is actually\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nrequired, otherwise the exceedingly rare very low-metallicity stars of the halo population will\nnot be represented in sufficient numbers. One must exercise caution, however, that abundance\nestimates for stars in the sample under consideration are as accurate as possible, due to the\npresence of an overlap of the local halo with the relatively high density thick-disk population (e.g.,\nAnthony-Twarog & Twarog 1994; BSL; Ryan & Lambert 1995; Twarog & Anthony-Twarog 1996;\nCY). It is similarly important to assemble a large and homogeneously analyzed sample, both to\nminimize statistical fluctuations in the derived kinematic quantities, and to reduce the effects of\nother systematic errors (such as might arise in estimates of stellar distances).\nIn this paper we present an analysis of the kinematics of metal-deficient field stars in the\nsolar neighborhood, based on a large catalog of stars selected without kinematic bias (Beers et\nal. 2000, hereafter Paper II). This catalog, consisting of 2041 stars from the published literature\nwith abundances [Fe/H]\u2264 \u22120.6, includes updated stellar positions, newly derived homogeneous\ndistance estimates, revised radial velocities, and refined metal abundance estimates. Moreover,\na subset of some 1200 stars in the catalog now have available proper motions, taken from a\nvariety of recently completed proper motion catalogs. We note that this catalog is (by far) the\nlargest sample of metal-deficient field stars with available proper motions among any previously\nassembled non-kinematically selected samples. Thus, it is now possible to draw a much more\ndefinitive picture of the early kinematic evolution of the Galaxy.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we present a discussion of the detailed velocity\ndistributions of our sample stars, concentrating on those presently located in the solar\nneighborhood. In \u00a73 we analyze the orbital motions of these stars. In \u00a74 we consider the global\ncharacter of the halo of the Galaxy, as deduced from the kinematics of a local sample. In \u00a75, we\nfurther examine evidence for kinematic substructure in the phase-space distribution of the halo.\nFinally, in \u00a76, the results of the present work are summarized, and their implications for the\nformation and evolution of the Galaxy are discussed.\n\n2.\n\nVelocity Distributions of the Metal-Poor Stars\n2.1.\n\nIndividual and Mean Space Velocities\n\nPaper II of this series presented proper motions for 1214 stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.6, as well\nas for a number of slightly more metal-rich stars. Within this sample, 1203 stars with [Fe/H]\n\u2264 \u22120.6 have distance estimates and radial velocities as well as proper motions, so that the\nfull three-dimensional velocities are directly calculable. Figure 1 is a reproduction of Figure 8\nfrom Paper II, and shows the local velocity components vs. [Fe/H] for these 1203 stars. The\nvelocity components U , V , and W are directed to the Galactic anticenter, rotation direction,\nand north Galactic pole, respectively, and have been corrected for the local solar motion\n(U\u2299 , V\u2299 , W\u2299 ) = (\u22129, 12, 7) km s\u22121 with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) (Mihalas\n& Binney 1981). Note the excellent coverage of this sample over the entire range of Galactic\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nabundances, especially below [Fe/H] = \u22122 and above [Fe/H] = \u22121, where previous studies that\nmade use of, for example, the sample of metal-poor stars studied with Hipparcos, lack sufficient\nnumbers of stars (compare, e.g., with Figure 4 of CY).\nTo examine the characteristic local velocity distributions of our sample, we confine ourselves\nto a discussion of the stars for which the Galactocentric distance along the plane, R, is between 7\nand 10 kpc, and those for which the distance from the Sun, D, is within 4 kpc. Six stars in this\nsubsample have large rest-frame velocities, VRF > 550 km s\u22121 , that are in excess of the canonical\nescape velocity in the solar neighborhood (Vesc \u223c 500 \u2212 550 km s\u22121 ; Carney, Latham, & Laird\n1988). Although some of the space velocities may indeed be this high, the majority of these stars\nprobably have large VRF due to an over-estimation of their distances, which has artificially inflated\ntheir estimated tangential velocities. We choose to remove these extreme-velocity stars by placing\nan additional limit of VRF \u2264 550 km s\u22121 on the sample. The stars satisfying the above selection\ncriteria are referred to as the \"Selected Sample\" in the following discussion.\nWe first calculate the mean velocities (< U >, < V >, < W >) and velocity dispersions\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) for the Selected Sample \u2013 values for five characteristic ranges in metal abundance\nare listed in Table 1a. Velocity dispersions are estimated from the standard deviations, after\ncorrection for the typical measurement errors in the velocities (\u223c 10 km s\u22121 ). Figure 2 shows\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) as a function of [Fe/H]. In this Figure we have adopted a finer binning in metal\nabundance; the dispersion measurements in each bin are listed in Table 1b. The filled and open\ncircles in Figure 2 denote the stars at |Z| < 1 kpc and |Z| < 4 kpc, respectively, where Z is the\nheight above the Galactic plane.\nThe most metal-deficient stars in the Selected Sample, those more metal-poor than [Fe/H]\n= \u22122.2, are dominated by members of the halo population. For |Z| < 1 kpc, these stars\nexhibit a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid (\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (141 \u00b1 11, 106 \u00b1 9, 94 \u00b1 8) km s\u22121 ,\nin good agreement with previous results (e.g., BSL; CY). With a slightly more metal-rich\ncut on the abundances, i.e., selecting stars with [Fe/H] < \u22121.7, we obtain similar values,\n(148 \u00b1 7, 110 \u00b1 5, 92 \u00b1 4) km s\u22121 , so it appears that the shape of the velocity ellipsoid remains\nessentially unchanged with varying [Fe/H] below [Fe/H] = \u22121.7. In this regard Norris (1994)\nclaimed, from his analysis of a sample of high proper-motion stars, that \u03c3W continues to increase\nwith decreasing [Fe/H], even at its lowest levels. This result was taken to indicate the possible\nexistence of a dynamically \"hot\" proto-disk population at low abundances. Carney et al. (1996)\ndisputed this result, as their analysis of a different set of high proper-motion stars indicated that\nthe disk component is not dynamically hot, at least when membership is confined to the stars\norbiting exclusively within the inner part of the Galaxy, R \u2264 14 kpc. Figure 2c shows no evidence\nfor an increase of \u03c3W at low abundances.\nThe velocity dispersion components of the Selected Sample in the more metal-rich abundance\nranges decrease as the contribution of the thick disk component progressively increases. In\nparticular, for \u22120.7 \u2264 [Fe/H] < \u22120.6 and |Z| < 1 kpc, where the contribution of the halo\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ncomponent is expected to be negligible, the mean V velocity, < V >, is \u221220 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 ; the\nvelocity dispersions are (\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (46 \u00b1 4, 50 \u00b1 4, 35 \u00b1 3) km s\u22121 . This result is in agreement\nwith previously derived kinematic parameters for the thick disk, which appears to be in rapid\nrotation (\u223c200 km s\u22121 ), provided the rotational speed of the LSR is VLSR = 220 km s\u22121 (BSL).\nWith these values for the thick disk kinematics, it is possible to estimate the radial scale length of\nthis component using the following formula (Binney & Tremaine 1987):\n\n2VLSR Vlag \u2212\n\n2\nVlag\n\n=\n\n\u03c3U2\n\nR\n\u03c32\n\u22121 + V2 + 2\nhR\n\u03c3U\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vlag is the asymmetric drift given by Vlag = \u2212 < V >, and hR is the scale length of the\ndisk, provided its density varies as exp(\u2212R/hR ). By inserting VLSR = 220 \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 , the\nassumed solar radius R = 8.5 kpc (Kerr & Lynden-Bell 1986) and derived parameters for \u22120.7 \u2264\n[Fe/H] < \u22120.6 in Equation (1), we obtain hR = 4.5 \u00b1 0.6 kpc. This is in good agreement with\nhR = 4.7 \u00b1 0.5 kpc obtained by BSL, and also with the lower limit of hR \u2243 4.5 kpc derived by\nRatnatunga & Freeman (1989). We note that the second term on the left-hand side of Equation\n(1) has been omitted in some previous works, as it is small compared to other terms. If we were\nto exclude this term, we would obtain hR = 4.3 \u00b1 0.6 kpc, thereby slightly underestimating hR .\n\n2.2.\n\nRotational Character of the Selected Sample\n\nWe now examine the rotational character of the Selected Sample. Figure 3 shows the mean\nrotational velocities < V\u03c6 > (the rotation velocity in a cylindrical coordinate frame) as a function\nof [Fe/H], based on stars in the Selected Sample. The left-hand panel in Figure 3a displays the\nresults for the abundance ranges listed in Table 2, for three subsets of the sample as a function of\ndistance above the plane. In the right-hand panel of Figure 3a, the bins are obtained by passing a\nbox of width N = 100 stars, ordered by metallicity, with an overlap of 20 stars each. The latter\napproach is adopted to avoid any effects of the arbitrary placement of bins on the results.\nNote that the panels in Figure 3a are obtained with full knowledge of the space motions of\nthe stars in the Selected Sample. Figure 3b is based on the radial velocities alone, applying the\nmethodology of Frenk & White (1980) (FW) (see also Norris 1986; Morrison, Flynn, & Freeman\n1990, hereafter MFF; BSL). The solid lines in the left and right-hand panels of Figure 3b denote\n< V\u03c6 > as derived for the stars with available proper motions (denoted as < V\u03c6 >FpmW in Table\n2), i.e., the same sample as in Figure 3a, whereas the dashed lines are for all of the stars with\navailable radial velocities (< V\u03c6 >FallW in Table 2). Comparison between Figures 3a and 3b allows\nus to examine whether the Selected Sample is subject to any significant kinematic bias, since, if\nso, the < V\u03c6 > derived from the space motions is expected to be systematically smaller from that\ndetermined on the basis of radial velocities alone (Ryan & Norris 1991; Norris & Ryan 1991).\nFigure 3a clearly indicates that the rotational properties of the Selected Sample change\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndiscontinuously at [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22121.7. Stars with [Fe/H] < \u22121.7 exhibit no systematic variation of\n< V\u03c6 > with decreasing [Fe/H]. It is interesting to note that the subsample of low-abundance\nstars with |Z| < 1 kpc show a rather large prograde rotation of < V\u03c6 >= 30 \u223c 50 km s\u22121 , and\nthat < V\u03c6 > decreases if stars at larger heights are considered, at least for the two abundance bins\ncentered on [Fe/H] = \u22121.9 and \u22122.2, respectively. This behavior is not exhibited, however, for\nstars in the lowest abundance bin. To check the significance of this feature, we have combined\nthe stars in our Selected Sample in the metallicity interval \u22122.4 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.9 and obtained\n< V\u03c6 > by sweeping a box of 50 stars ordered by |Z|, with an overlap of 30 stars. The results are\nsummarized in Table 3 and depicted in Figure 4. The lower solid line in Figure 4 is a least-squares\nfit to the data, which yields \u2206 < V\u03c6 > /\u2206|Z| = \u221252 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , indicating the presence of\na significant vertical gradient in < V\u03c6 > at low abundances. Figure 4 also suggests that < V\u03c6 >\nbeyond |Z| \u223c 1.2 kpc has a nearly constant zero value. If we exclude the last point at |Z| = 1.76\nkpc from the fit, we obtain \u2206 < V\u03c6 > /\u2206|Z| = \u221262 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 (shown as a dotted line).\nNote that Majewski (1992) reported evidence for a halo component which is in retrograde motion\n(V\u03c6 = \u2212275 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121 ), but which exhibited no gradient of rotation with distance from the\nplane, a result that is clearly at odds with our present result.\nFigure 3a shows that for stars in the Selected Sample with [Fe/H] > \u22121.7 there is a clear\nlinear dependence of < V\u03c6 > on [Fe/H], a dependence that remains essentially unchanged even if\nthe range of |Z| is varied. This discontinuity has been seen before, of course, based on analysis\nof smaller samples (e.g., Norris 1986; Carney 1988; Zinn 1988; Norris & Ryan 1989; BSL; CY).\nThe inescapable conclusion is that the transition from halo to disk must not have occurred in a\ncontinuous manner, as predicted in the ELS model. However, the vertical gradient in < V\u03c6 >\nfor metal-poor stars noted above suggests that the halo was not formed in a totally chaotic,\ndissipationless manner as implied in the SZ hypothesis. Rather, dissipational processes may have\nplayed a role in the initial contraction of the halo, likely involving energy exchange with the gas\nphase (Carney et al. 1996).\nIt is also worth noting from Figure 3 that the stars of the thick disk, which dominate the\nSelected Sample for [Fe/H] > \u22121, exhibit only a small change in < V\u03c6 > with increasing |Z|. Table\n3 and Figure 4 summarize the change of < V\u03c6 > with |Z| for stars likely to be dominated by the\nthick disk, i.e., in the abundance range \u22120.8 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.6. The least-squares fit to the data\n(as shown by upper solid line) yields \u2206 < V\u03c6 > /\u2206|Z| = \u221230 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , much smaller than\nthe gradient obtained for halo stars with \u22122.4 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.9, but similar to previous estimates\nof the thick disk rotational velocity gradients reported by Majewski (1992).\nThe relation between < V\u03c6 > and [Fe/H] as shown in the panels of Figure 3a is also seen\nin the panels of Figure 3b. In particular, < V\u03c6 > obtained from the subsample having available\nproper motions (dashed lines) is essentially the same as that from the entire sample (solid lines)\nwithin standard errors in < V\u03c6 > (except for [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.6: see below). This is consistent with\nour argument given in Paper II that the subsample based on stars with available proper motions\nis not subject to any significant kinematic bias.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nWe note that near [Fe/H] = \u22121.6 in Figure 3b, < V\u03c6 > obtained from consideration of the\nsample with full space motions is larger than that obtained from the sample using radial velocities\nalone. The apparent retrograde rotation of globular clusters in the similar metallicity range was\nalso reported by Rodgers & Paltoglou (1984) based on radial velocities alone, whereas Dinescu,\nGirard, & van Altena (1999) found no sign of significant retrograde rotation using full space\nmotions of globular clusters. It is worth noting that this difference in the rotational velocity using\neither of radial velocities or full space motions is not a signature of kinematic bias, since the result\nis in the opposite direction to that expected. This difference probably arises due to limitations\nof the FW methodology as applied to our sample. The FW method implicitly assumes that the\nangle, \u03c8, between the line-of-sight and the rotational direction is randomly distributed in the\nsample, which may not apply in this case. In addition, the apparent excursion to large retrograde\nrotation, < V\u03c6 >\u2243 \u221240 km s\u22121 near [Fe/H] = \u22121.6 in the right-hand panel of Figure 3b (also\nnoted by BSL), may be caused by a few outliers having large velocities as seen by an observer at\nrest with respect to the Galactic center, Vgal . If we exclude five stars having large Vgal from the\nbin centered at [Fe/H] = \u22121.6, we obtain < V\u03c6 >= \u221212 km s\u22121 . We have verified that the effect\nof outliers on < V\u03c6 > is small in other abundance ranges.\nThe influence of a disk-like population for [Fe/H] > \u22121.7 is certainly suggested by the\nappearance of Figure 3. The question of the limiting abundance of a so-called metal-weak thick\ndisk (MWTD)1 has been considered several times in the past (MFF; Rodgers & Roberts 1993;\nLayden 1995; BSL; Ryan & Lambert 1995; Twarog & Anthony-Twarog 1996; CY). Figure 5 shows\nthe frequency distribution of V\u03c6 for the stars in the Selected Sample with available space motions,\nfor subsets chosen to have (a) |Z| < 1 kpc, and (b) |Z| \u2265 1 kpc, respectively. At |Z| < 1 kpc, where\nthe disk-like kinematics are expected to be more evident than at larger heights above the plane,\nthe metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] > \u22121 are peaked at V\u03c6 = 200 km s\u22121 , a rather high rotational\nvelocity. One also sees the presence of a small contribution of the stars with halo-like kinematics.\nAt lower abundances the halo-like kinematics become much more dominant; the contribution of\nthe MWTD is apparently decreasing at lower abundances and higher |Z|.\nTo quantify the fraction of the MWTD in our local sample within the specified abundance\nranges, we have fit the subset of stars with |Z| < 1 kpc using a mixture of two Gaussian\ndistributions for V\u03c6 , representing the halo and disk populations. The halo kinematic parameters\n(< V\u03c6 >halo , \u03c3\u03c6,halo ) = (+33,106) km s\u22121 are derived from stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2. The rotation\nvelocity of the disk component, < V\u03c6 >disk = +200 km s\u22121 , is obtained considering the stars in\nthe metallicity range \u22120.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.6. With these parameters fixed, we evaluate the most\nlikely values of the velocity dispersion of the disk, \u03c3\u03c6,disk and fraction F of the MWTD, using a\nmaximum likelihood analysis (see also MFF; CY). The likelihood function for the stars with V\u03c6i is\ngiven by\n1\n\nThese metal-poor stars with disk-like kinematics may also include a considerable portion of the thin disk if its\nmetallicity distribution overlaps that of the thick disk (Wyse & Gilmore 1995).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nlog f (F, \u03c3\u03c6,disk ) =\n\nN\nX\n\ni\ni\nlog[F fdisk\n+ (1 \u2212 F )fhalo\n],\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\ni\ni\nwhere fdisk\n(fhalo\n) denote Gaussian functions with mean velocities < V\u03c6 >disk (< V\u03c6 >halo ) and\ndispersions \u03c3\u03c6,disk (\u03c3\u03c6,halo ). The results of the likelihood analysis are tabulated in Table 4, and\nshown by the solid curves in Figure 5. The MWTD contributes about 30% of the metal-poor stars\nin the abundance range \u22121.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121, which is smaller than the fraction derived by MFF\n(\u223c72%) and BSL (\u223c60%), but larger than the result of CY (\u223c10%). The fraction of the MWTD\nis quite modest in the more metal-poor ranges, in contrast to the suggestion of BSL, who argued\nfor \u223c30% even at [Fe/H] < \u22122. One reason that our result may differ so strikingly from that of\nBSL is that the estimated abundances for many of the HK survey stars at [Fe/H] < \u22122, listed in\nthe original BSL catalog, are likely to have been underestimated by \u223c 0.3 dex (see Figure 1 of\nPaper II).\n\nThe RR Lyrae stars in our Selected Sample (shown as shaded histograms in Figure 5) exhibit\nno clear disk-like kinematics, even in the intermediate abundance range of \u22121.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.\nThis confirms earlier results by MFF, Layden (1995), and CY, and may imply a somewhat\nyounger age of the thick disk as compared to the halo. However, the numbers of RR Lyraes with\navailable space motions is rather small, so this question, especially in conjunction with their period\ndistributions to investigate different populations of RR Lyraes (Lee & Carney 1999), should be\nrevisited when the sample size has been increased.\n\n3.\n\nOrbital Properties of the Metal-Poor Stars\n\nIn this section we investigate the orbital properties of our sample of stars in a given Galactic\npotential. We adopt the analytic St\u00e4ckel-type potential developed by Sommer-Larsen & Zhen\n(1990, hereafter SLZ), which consists of a flattened, oblate disk and a nearly spherical massive\nhalo. This model potential is consistent with the mass model of Bahcall, Schmidt, & Soneira\n(1982), exhibiting a flat rotation curve beyond R = 4 kpc, and having a commensurate local mass\ndensity at R = R\u2299 . In contrast to a non-analytic potential, for which numerical integrations\nof orbits are required, the analytic nature of the adopted potential has the great advantage of\nmaintaining clarity in the analysis, as demonstrated below. In the Appendix, we summarize the\nproperties of the St\u00e4ckel mass model, and provide expressions for three integrals of motion in such\na model (see also de Zeeuw 1985; Dejonghe & de Zeeuw 1988)\n\n3.1.\n\nrpr\n\nThe Relationship between Orbital Eccentricity and Metal Abundance\n\nWe first compute orbital eccentricities, defined as e = (rap \u2212 rpr )/(rap + rpr ), where rap and\ndenote the apogalactic and perigalactic distances of the orbits, respectively. These orbital\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nparameters are tabulated in Table 3 of Paper II for the stars under consideration. In Figure 6a,\nwe show the relation between e and [Fe/H]. As is evident, there is no strong correlation between\nthese quantities, and the metal-poor stars below [Fe/H] = \u22122 exhibit a diverse range in orbital\neccentricities. This is in sharp contrast to the ELS result, and confirms previous suggestions from\na number of workers, but in a much more definitive manner (Yoshii & Saio 1979; NBP; Carney\n& Latham 1986; Carney, Latham, & Laird 1990; Norris & Ryan 1991; CY). In addition to the\ndiverse distribution of e at all abundances, we note a small concentration of the stars at e \u223c 0.9\nand [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7, which is somewhat reminiscent of the original ELS result. It is perhaps not\ncoincidental that the excess number of high-e stars occurs at an abundance which matches the\nsharp discontinuity of < V\u03c6 > found at [Fe/H] = \u22121.7, where < V\u03c6 > is almost zero (Figure 3).\nThis may suggest that a significant fraction of the metal-poor stars with abundances near [Fe/H]\n= \u22121.7 formed from infalling gas of this metallicity during an early stage of Galaxy formation, in\na manner similar to an ELS collapse.\nIn Figure 6b, we show the mean eccentricity, < e >, vs. [Fe/H], where the bins are obtained\nby passing a box of width N = 100 stars, ordered by metallicity, with an overlap of 20 stars each.\nFor comparison, the dashed line denotes the result of Carney et al. (1996) for their high proper\nmotion sample. There is a clear difference from our results \u2013 the use of a kinematically selected\nsample overestimates the average orbital eccentricities at a given [Fe/H], by an amount up to 0.2.\nFigure 7 shows the cumulative distributions of e, N (< e), in two specific abundance ranges,\n(a) for [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2, and (b) for \u22121.4 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121. Figure 7a clearly demonstrates that even\nat quite low abundance, roughly 20% of our stars have e < 0.4. The different lines correspond to\nthe cases when the range of |Z| is changed. It is apparent that, for stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2, the\ncumulative distribution function of e is unchanged when considering subsets of the data with a\nrange of |Z|, suggesting the absence of any substantial disk-like component below this metallicity.\nBy way of contrast, Figure 7b shows that stars with intermediate abundances exhibit (a) a higher\nfraction of orbits with e < 0.4 than for the lower abundance stars, (b) a decrease in the relative\nfraction of low eccentricity stars as larger heights above the Galactic plane are considered, and\n(c) convergence at larger heights to a fraction which is close to the 20% obtained for the lower\nabundance stars. These results imply that the orbital motions of the stars in the intermediate\nabundance range are, in part, affected by the presence of thick-disk component with a finite scale\nheight. We recall that CY and Chiba, Yoshii & Beers (1999), using a sample of metal-poor stars\nwith Hipparcos measurements, found a further decrease of the fraction of the stars with e < 0.4\nat larger |Z|, without achieving the convergence noted here (see Figure 15 of CY). This was\npresumably due to the lack of a sufficient number of intermediate abundance stars at large |Z| in\nthe sample considered by these authors.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nStructural Parameters of the MWTD Component\n\nWe now seek to quantitatively describe the abundance range, scale height, and fraction of\nthe MWTD component in our sample. We apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test of the null\nhypothesis that the differential distributions of e, n(e), for stars in a specified abundance range,\nare drawn from the same parent population of eccentricities as stars belonging to a \"pure\" halo\ncomponent. Based on our analysis above, we take the subsample of 78 stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2\nand |Z| < 1 kpc to represent the pure halo component. We then calculate the KS probabilities,\nPKS , for the stars in various intermediate abundance ranges and with |Z| > Zlim , where Zlim is\nthe lower limit on the heights of the stars above the Galactic plane. We expect that, even if the\nspecified abundance range is contaminated by stars with disk-like kinematics, it will be dominated\nby halo-like kinematics above some |Z| = Zlim , with PKS exceeding 0.2 (i.e., the subsamples being\nconsistent with draws from the same parent population of orbital eccentricities).\nFigure 8 shows the results of the KS tests. In order to obtain an estimate for the value of\nZlim above which the populations cannot be distinguished, Figure 8a depicts the results for the\nstars below [Fe/H] = \u22121, but above the specified lower limit for the abundance. In the left-hand\npanel of Figure 8a, it is seen that PKS rapidly increases at Zlim = 0.5 to 1.3 kpc and then remains\nroughly constant at larger Zlim . In the right-hand panel of Figure 8a, the distribution of PKS on\nZlim changes dramatically as one passes from the inclusion of stars with [Fe/H] > \u22121.9 to those\nwith [Fe/H] > \u22122.0. When stars with abundances as low as [Fe/H] = \u22122.0 are included, there is\nno value of Zlim for which the distributions can be distinguished. To identify the lower limit on\nthe abundance of stars which are members of the MWTD, Figure 8b shows the distribution of\nPKS for metal-poor stars above [Fe/H] = \u22122.2, but below the specified upper limit on abundance.\nAs is seen in the left-hand panel of this figure, PKS remains small (indicating that the populations\ncan be distinguished) at all Zlim . In the right-hand panel of Figure 8b, one sees that although\nthere exists a region at small Zlim where the populations can be marginally distinguished when the\nupper limit on abundance is taken to be [Fe/H] = \u22121.9, there is no such region when stars with\nan upper limit of [Fe/H] = \u22122.0 is considered. These results suggest that the MWTD component\nhas a characteristic scale height of roughly 1 kpc, above which halo-like orbital motions dominate,\nand a lower abundance limit near [Fe/H] = \u22122.0. We note here that the number of stars employed\nin the KS tests is sufficiently large in the ranges of Zlim considered (e.g. N = 240 for \u22122 <\n[Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 and N = 54 for \u22122.2 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122 at Zlim = 1 kpc). However, it would be useful,\nespecially at larger Zlim , to boost the sample sizes so that more detailed investigations can be\ncarried out.\nWe now estimate the contribution of the MWTD component in the solar neighborhood, F ,\nusing the distribution of e in various abundance ranges. Following the methodology developed by\nCY, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the e-distribution from a mixture of stars\ncontributed by the thick-disk and halo populations, adopting the kinematic parameters for these\ncomponents derived in \u00a72, and compare with the observed cumulative distribution functions of\neccentricity in our sample with |Z| < 1 kpc. Figure 9 shows the results of this exercise. As is clear,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmore metal-rich ranges are described by a larger F , but in the abundance range \u22122.2 < [Fe/H]\n\u2264 \u22122, F \u2243 0, in good agreement with the results obtained from comparison of the differential\neccentricity distributions. Figure 10 shows the dependence of F on [Fe/H] for stars with |Z| < 1\nkpc, where the fits are made with bins of 0.2 dex for [Fe/H] and 0.1 for F . The F ([Fe/H]) derived\nhere, based on full knowledge of the stellar orbital motions, is rather similar to that found by BSL\nbased on radial velocities alone, except for the abundance range below [Fe/H] < \u22121.5, where the\nMWTD appears more modestly populated. A characteristic value of F = 0.3 over the abundance\nrange \u22121.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 is obtained from our present analysis.\nHaving obtained the structural parameters of the MWTD component, we extract a set\nof likely members of the MWTD component in our sample. High-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations of these stars, to obtain estimates of their individual elemental abundances, should\nprovide valuable information concerning the nature of MWTD stars, and reveal differences, if any,\nin their compositions relative to similar metallicity stars of the halo population (e.g., Bonifacio,\nCenturion, & Molaro 1999). In Table 5 we list the stars satisfying (1) \u22122.2 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121,\n(2) |Z| \u2264 1 kpc, (3) V\u03c6 \u2265< V\u03c6 >disk \u2212\u03c3\u03c6,disk , and (4) |VR | \u2264 \u03c3R,disk and |VZ | \u2264 \u03c3Z,disk , where\n< V\u03c6 >disk = 200 km s\u22121 and (\u03c3R,disk , \u03c3\u03c6,disk , \u03c3Z,disk ) = (46, 50, 35) km s\u22121 , as derived above).\nCondition (3) corresponds to the high rotation velocity of the candidate members and condition\n(4) is placed so that their velocities in R and Z directions are confined within a 1 \u03c3 range relative\nto the zero mean, i.e. within the velocity dispersions of the MWTD component. In Table 5, the\nfourth column denotes the classification of each stellar type. We follow the coding of paper II \u2013 D:\nmain-sequence dwarf star; TO: main-sequence turnoff star; SG: subgiant star; G: giant star; AGB:\nasymptotic giant branch star; FHB: field horizontal-branch star; RRV: RR Lyrae variable star; V:\nvariable star. Note that Table 5 supersedes Table 8 of BSL, as we now have much more complete\nkinematic information.\n\n4.\n\nGlobal Dynamics and Structure of the Halo\n\nAlthough our present sample is dominated by stars located in the vicinity of the Sun, the\norbits of many of these stars explore regions well into the more distant halo of the Galaxy. Thus,\ntheir local kinematics provide information on the global dynamics and structure of the halo (May\nand Binney 1986). In this section we first investigate the rotational properties of the halo at\nlarge heights from the Galactic plane, then use this same sample to obtain a picture of the global\ndensity distribution of the halo.\n\n4.1.\n\nRotational Properties of the Halo\n\nMajewski (1992) claimed, on the basis of measured proper motions for an in situ sample\nof halo subdwarfs located at Z > 5 kpc (in a small field in the direction of the North Galactic\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nPole), that stars at such large heights above the Galactic plane exhibit a net retrograde rotation\n< V\u03c6 >\u2243 \u221255 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121 , in contrast to the stars nearer the plane, which show a near-zero or\nslightly prograde rotation. Although there have been criticisms of this result (e.g., Ryan 1992),\na number of workers have also reported observations of separate samples which seem to support\nthis view, so the true situation has remained unclear. For example, Carney et al. (1996) reported\nevidence for a retrograde rotation in the subset of their local sample of high proper-motion stars\nwhose orbits extend far above the plane. In their analysis, they divided the sample into those stars\nwith Zmax \u2264 2 kpc, and Zmax \u2265 5 kpc, respectively, where Zmax is the maximum distance of the\nderived orbit from the plane. Carney et al. showed that their \"high halo\" sample, with < [Fe/H]\n>= \u22122.04 and Zmax \u2265 5 kpc, exhibited a net retrograde rotation (< V\u03c6 >= \u221245 \u00b1 22 km s\u22121 ),\nwhereas their \"low halo\" sample at Zmax \u2264 2 kpc exhibited a net prograde rotation ranging from\n< V\u03c6 >= 12 km s\u22121 to 44 km s\u22121 , depending on the specific criteria chosen to avoid stars of the\ndisk component.\nFigure 11a reproduces the original data of Carney et al. (1996), for stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.5.\nSince, in their estimates of Zmax , Carney et al. adopted a different Galactic potential than ours,\nwe have also re-determined Zmax for their sample with the same potential described in \u00a73, and\nshow the results in this same figure. Regardless of the adopted potential, it is apparent that the\nstars at Zmax \u2265 5 kpc exhibit a net retrograde rotation, as compared to the stars at Zmax \u2264 2\nkpc, which are in prograde rotation. Carney et al. argued that this result might be explained by\nthe presence of two distinct halo populations, a high halo formed via accretion of fragments (such\nas in the SZ model), and a low halo formed from an organized contraction (similar to the ELS\nmodel).\nThe Carney et al. sample is based on high proper-motion stars selected from the Lowell\nProper Motion Catalog, where proper motions are measured to exceed 0.26\" yr\u22121 , and the New\nLuyten Two-Tenths Catalog with proper motions exceeding roughly 0.18\" yr\u22121 . Thus, their\nsample is a-priori biased against inclusion of stars with prograde rotation close to the velocity of\nthe LSR. What remains to be evaluated is the effect that this kinematic bias may have on the\nobserved kinematics of the high halo.\nWe consider the question of bias in the Carney et al. sample via a Monte Carlo simulation,\nwith the following assumptions. \"Stars\" with [Fe/H] < \u22121.5 are randomly distributed in\nGalactic coordinates (l, b), and are assumed to have a Gaussian velocity distribution with\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (141, 108, 94) km s\u22121 , but with no systematic rotation. Distances to the simulated\nstars are taken by adopting a Gaussian form with mean 0.18 kpc and dispersion 0.09 kpc, which\nreproduces well the distance distribution of their sample stars. We further assume that only the\nstars whose inferred proper motions exceed 0.26\" yr\u22121 are observed at the Sun with VLSR = 220\nkm s\u22121 . The result is shown in panel Figure 11b. The simulated data sample exhibits a net\nretrograde rotation for stars in the high halo. We note that our simulation does not exhibit a net\nprograde rotation in the low halo, as seen in the Carney et al. sample. This may arise because\ntheir sample is not distributed randomly in (l, b), as our simulation assumes, and/or because their\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ndisk sample may be mainly drawn from stars for which the proper motion limit is 0.18\" yr\u22121 .\nNevertheless, the results of this simple simulation provide reason to be skeptical of their claim of\nthe existence of a retrograde high halo, which clearly can be influenced by selection bias of the\ninput sample2 .\nOur large non-kinematically selected sample provides the means to elucidate the rotational\ncharacter of the high halo without the effect of an input selection bias. Figure 11c presents our\nresults based on sample stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.5. It is found that the stars at small Zmax show a\nnet prograde rotation, in agreement with the results presented in \u00a72 and also with the Carney et\nal. (1996) result: we obtain < V\u03c6 >= 59 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 for 230 stars at Zmax < 2 kpc. However, at\nlarge Zmax , the stars exhibit no systematic rotation, in sharp contrast to the Carney et al. result:\nwe obtain < V\u03c6 >= 0 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 for 212 stars at Zmax \u2265 4 kpc. We note that although there is a\ndifference in the rotational velocities for the stars close to and farther from the plane, which may\nsuggest two populations (accreted and contracted populations), the boundary between them is not\nobvious.\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Global Density Distribution of the Halo\n\nMay & Binney (1986) discussed the interesting possibility that, on the basis of Jeans' theorem,\nthe global structure of the stellar halo can be recovered from local kinematic information for a\nsufficiently large sample of stars observed in the solar neighborhood. The theorem states that,\nfor a well-mixed stellar system, the six-dimensional phase-space distribution function of stars,\nf (x, v), can be taken to be a function of the three isolating integrals of motion Ii , i = 1, 2, 3,\ni.e. f (I1 , I2 , I3 ). Within this isolating integral space, the stars constitute a set of fixed points\nwith no time evolution. May & Binney argued that the stars observed in the solar neighborhood\nactually occupy a large fraction of this phase space, and it is hence possible to reconstruct the\nglobal structure of the stellar system from the kinematic data of nearby stars. Following these\nstrategies, SLZ developed a maximum likelihood method for recovering a global model of the halo\nbased on a discrete sum of orbits, and applied it to a sample of 118 local stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.5\nselected without kinematic bias. SLZ found that the stellar halo at 8 < R < 20 kpc may consist\nof two components \u2013 a main, nearly spherical component, and an overlapping, highly flattened\ncomponent. We note here that the actual halo system is unlikely to be in a well mixed equilibrium\nstate, as we will discuss in the next section. However, the relaxation process is very slow compared\nto the orbital periods of typical stars, so the Jeans theorem and the above approach based on it\nare at least approximately valid.\nWe now apply the SLZ methodology to the present sample of stars, which is both larger, and\n2\n\nCarney (1999) reported that, after making a statistical correction for the kinematic bias in the Carney et al. 1996\nsample, he also obtained a net prograde rotation even in the high halo.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nhas more accurately determined kinematic information than was available to SLZ. To exclude the\nMWTD stars as much as possible, we select as representatives of the halo population the stars\nin our sample with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8, a more restrictive abundance cut than the [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.5\nused by SLZ. We also select a sample of stars with \u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 in order to examine the\ncharacteristics derived for a halo population contaminated by the MWTD. To minimize the effects\nof distance errors we limit our samples to those stars satisfying D \u2264 4 kpc. We also remove stars\nwith inferred (and possibly incorrect) extreme space motions (VRF \u2264 550 km s\u22121 ). After applying\nthese cuts, the samples we investigate include N = 359 stars for [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8, and N = 302 stars\nfor \u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 .\nThe method is summarized as follows (see SLZ for the complete description): (1) the N sets\nof isolating integrals (I1,i , I2,i , I3,i ), i = 1, ..., N are calculated from the observed positions xi and\nvelocities vi of the stars, within an assumed Galactic potential. Here, I1 is the total orbital energy\nE, I2 is proportional to the square of the angular momentum vector pointing in the Z-direction\nI2 = L2z /2 (which measures azimuthal angular momentum), and I3 is the so-called third integral\nof motion as defined in the Appendix (see also equation 15 of SLZ). For the Galactic potential,\nwe adopt the same St\u00e4ckel model as in \u00a73. (2) At all locations of the stars xj , j = 1, ..., N , the\nprobability density \u03c1i (xj ) of an orbit characterized by (Ei , I2,i , I3,i ) is calculated for i = 1, ..., N .\nIn other words, we calculate the N 2 matrix \u03c1ij , i, j = 1, ..., N from knowledge of integrals and\nlocations of the orbits. (3) By maximizing the probability that the star found at xj=1 is on orbit\ni = 1, the star found at xj=2 is on orbit i = 2, and so forth, the orbit weighting factors, ci , are\nused to estimate the total density at x, viz\n\u03c1(x) =\n\nN\nX\n\nci \u03c1i (x) .\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nThus, equation (3) provides an estimate of the density of the halo stars at any point x. The\nmethod also permits one to derive the mean azimuthal velocities as:\n< V\u03c6 > (x) =\n\nN\n1 X\nci \u03c1i (x)V\u03c6,i (x) .\n\u03c1(x) i=1\n\n(4)\n\nWe proceed to average the results from equations (3) and (4) over grids of finite area. Following\nSLZ, we define the grids in the meridional plane of the spheroidal coordinates (\u03bb, \u03bd), which is a\nsuitable choice for St\u00e4ckel mass models (see the Appendix for more details). The grids are defined\nas \u03bbk = k2 \u2212 \u03b1, k = 1, ..., 30 and \u03bdl = (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1) cos2 (\u03b8l ) \u2212 \u03b3, \u03b8l = (\u03c0/2)(l/20), l = 0, ...20, as shown in\nFigure 4 of SLZ, where \u03b1 and \u03b3 are constants. The spatial resolution of the grids is about 1 kpc.\nFigure 12a shows a plot of the reconstructed density distribution at the Galactic plane (the\naveraged density over the area at l = 20), for [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8 (filled circles) and \u22121.6 < [Fe/H]\n\u2264 \u22121 (open circles). As a comparison, the results using the SLZ sample with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.5 are\nalso shown (crosses). As in the analysis of SLZ, the density distribution for R > 8 kpc is well\ndescribed by a power-law model \u03c1 \u221d R\u03b2 . For [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8, we find that the power-law model\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nwith exponent \u03b2 = \u22123.55 \u00b1 0.13 fits well at all radii beyond R = 8 kpc, up to the grid point for\nthe largest radius, R = 35 kpc. Note that for the SLZ sample the density at the largest three\nradii appears to fall short of the power-law model (probably as a result of their smaller sample\nsize). If we omit these outer points, we obtain a fit to the power-law index \u03b2 = \u22123.57 \u00b1 0.16 at\n8 < R < 28 kpc, which is yet slightly steeper than the \u03b2 = \u22123.29 result of SLZ. It is of interest to\nnote that a power-law model with exponent \u03b2 \u2243 \u22123.5 derived for our sample of field halo stars is\nsimilar to the radial density distribution of the halo globular cluster population derived by Harris\n(1976) and Zinn (1985) (\u03b2 = \u22123.5) and by Carney, Latham, & Laird (1990) (\u03b2 = \u22123.0). A similar\ndensity distribution, but with a slightly shallower slope, has been found for field RR Lyrae stars\nby Saha (1985) (\u03b2 \u2243 \u22123) and Hawkins (1984) (\u03b2 \u2243 \u22123.1). Preston et al. (1991) combined counts\nof RR Lyrae stars and FHB stars in several fields to obtain the exponent \u03b2 = \u22123.5 \u00b1 0.3. We see,\nin our reconstructed density distribution, no clear evidence for a break in the density distribution\nat R = 20 \u2212 25 kpc as was detected in the number counts of globular clusters and RR Lyraes. For\nthe subsample of stars with \u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121, we obtain \u03b2 = \u22123.47 \u00b1 0.18 for 8 < R < 25 kpc,\nthus contamination from the MWTD has little effect. Below R = 8 kpc, the density distributions\nof all three samples clearly deviate from a single power-law model, a result which is likely caused\nby incomplete representation, in the solar neighborhood, of stars for which apocentric radii are\nbelow R = R\u2299 .\nFigure 12b shows the mean azimuthal velocities, < V\u03c6 >, for the same three samples of stars,\nprojected onto the Galactic plane. The value of < V\u03c6 > is nearly zero for R > 10 kpc, but there\nis a signature of increasing < V\u03c6 > with decreasing R. In particular, for the sample of stars with\n\u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121, < V\u03c6 > rises rather discontinuously at R \u2243 10 kpc, which may correspond\nto the radial limit of the rapidly rotating thick-disk component.\nFigure 13 is a plot of the inferred global density distribution in the (R, Z) plane, in the\nform of equidensity contours. The lack of stars at small R and large Z (which gives rise to the\nill-formed contour levels in this portion of the diagram) is a consequence of the small probability\nthat stars in the Galaxy that explore such a region are represented in the solar neighborhood (as\nargued in SLZ). Other than in this region, the inferred density distribution based on the 359 stars\nwith [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8 (panel b) appears to be very similar to that which SLZ obtained from their\n118 stars (panel a): The outer part of the halo, at R > 15 kpc, is round, in good agreement with\ninferences based on star counts (see Freeman 1987 and references therein; Preston et al. 1991).\nWhile we reproduce the general sense of the SLZ results with our much larger sample, there\nare notable differences in the details. SLZ argued that there is a clear indication that the halo, at\nany given radius, consists of both a main, nearly spherical component and an overlapping, highly\nflattened component. There no clear evidence for this result in the density reconstruction based on\nour new data. To further examine this point, we have fit elliptical contours to the reconstructed\ndensity maps after, following SLZ, omitting the data points near the Galactic plane. Specifically,\nwe obtain fits to ellipses of major axis a, and axial ratio q, over the polar angle 40\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 80\u25e6 .\nResiduals to the fits obtained to these ellipses as a function of polar angle are shown in Figure\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n14a. Thick solid and dotted lines correspond to the fits with a = 10.5 kpc and q = 0.70 and with\na = 13.5 kpc and q = 0.51, respectively, for our sample with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8. For comparison, we\nshow the corresponding results using the SLZ sample fit over 30\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 80\u25e6 (thin solid and dotted\nlines). It follows that, while we reproduce the SLZ result that there is a large density excess near\nthe Galactic plane when using their sample, it is not evident in our sample \u2013 an additional flat\ncomponent is not required for the fitting.\nBased on the above result, we proceed to make a fit including the density data near the plane,\nwith a single value for the axial ratio q at each major axis a, i.e., without taking into account an\nadditional flat component having small q. The change of our estimate of q as a function of radius\nis shown in Figure 14b. For the sample of stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8, the density distribution in the\nouter part of the halo, R \u223c 20 kpc, is quite round. However, the axial ratio q appears to decrease\nwith decreasing R over 15 < R < 20 kpc, and the inner part, at R < 15 kpc, exhibits q \u223c 0.65.\nThus, the halo can be described as nearly spherical in the outer part and highly flattened in the\ninner part, instead of the overlap of both components at all locations in the halo. This result is\nin good agreement with previous studies of the distribution of RR Lyrae (Hartwick 1987; Layden\n1995) and FHB stars (Preston et al. 1991; Kinman, Suntzeff, & Kraft 1994), as well as with the\nflattening of the inner halo reported by Larsen & Humphreys (1994) based on counts of F- and\nG-type stars. It remains an open question as to whether or not there exists a distinct boundary\nbetween the outer spherical halo and the inner flattened halo.\nAs seen in Figure 13c, the density distribution in the inner part of the halo for stars of\nintermediate abundance (\u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121) appears to be more flattened than is the case for\nstars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.8. This result is reflected in the ellipse fits for these stars shown in Figure\n14b, which indicate that 0.5 < q < 0.6 at R < 12 kpc. This may be due to the contribution of the\n(by definition) flattened, MWTD population with a finite radial scale length. We note that our\nresults imply the decrease of axial ratios at R > 17 kpc. This may be an artifact due to the small\nnumbers of stars employed at such large radii, so further analysis using much larger samples is\nnecessary.\n\n5.\n\nKinematic Substructure of the Halo in the Solar Neighborhood\n\nIf the halo of the Galaxy was assembled from the merging and/or accretion of small subgalactic\nclumps, as argued by SZ, then one might hope to find signatures of those events, even now, in the\nform of kinematic substructures, because the mixing of phase space for such stars is expected to\nbe incomplete (Helmi & White 1999). The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is an ongoing merging event\nat the current epoch (Ibata, Gilmore, & Irwin 1994), and the Magellanic Clouds may ultimately\nfollow the similar fate, as they lose energy via dynamical friction (Tremaine 1976). Signatures of\npast merging events in the halo were reported by Majewski et al. (1994) in their in situ sample\nof the stars at about 4.5 kpc above the Galactic plane. Helmi & White (1999) argue that the\nreported clumpiness in the velocity distribution of the halo stars from Majewski et al. is actually\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\na superposition of two individual streams of stars, possibly arising from a common progenitor.\nClear \"fossil evidence\" in the solar neighborhood for a previous merger of the Galaxy with\nwhat may have been a \"Seale & Zinn fragment\" has recently been discovered by Helmi et al.\n(1999, hereafter HWdZZ). These authors examined a subset of the stars in samples from our\nprevious work (BSL; CY), and identified a statistically significant clumping of stars in the angular\nmomentum diagram Lz vs L\u22a5 = (L2x + L2y )1/2 . The substructure identified by HWdZZ consists of\n7 stars (in a sample of 97 stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.6 and D < 1 kpc), or 12 stars (in a sample of\n275 stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 and D < 2.5 kpc). HWdZZ suggest, based on the observed numbers\nof stars in this clump, that roughly 10% of the halo stars outside the solar radius may have arisen\nfrom a single coherent object with a total mass of about 108 M\u2299 , disrupted during the process of\nhalo formation.\nWe now consider the HWdZZ result based on our revised catalog. Figure 15 shows the\nangular momentum diagram of HWdZZ as populated by the stars of our present sample within\n2.5 kpc of the Sun. Panels (a) and (b) are for stars in the abundance ranges [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.6 and\n\u22121.6 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121, respectively. In both of these abundance ranges there exists a clump of stars\nin the region that HWdZZ pointed out, at L\u22a5 \u223c 2200 kpc km s\u22121 and Lz \u223c 1200 kpc km s\u22121 . In\naddition to this clump, we identify a possible \"trail\" (in angular momentum space) which appears\nto connect the clump and the high Lz region, most clearly evident among the higher abundance\nstars shown in panel (b). For the purposes of this discussion, we define the \"clump\" region to\nbe comprised of stars with 2100 < L\u22a5 < 2600 kpc km s\u22121 and 800 < Lz < 1500 kpc km s\u22121\n(solid box), and the \"trail\" region to be comprised of stars having 1250 < L\u22a5 < 2000 kpc km s\u22121\nand 1200 < Lz < 2000 kpc km s\u22121 (dotted box), respectively. We include BPS CS 22876-0040\nas a \"trail\" member (triangle in Fig.15a), which is somewhat outside the region defined above,\n(Lz , L\u22a5 ) = (1037, 1672) kpc km s\u22121 , because this star exhibits similar orbital motions to the\n\"trail\" stars examined below.\nWe note that the angular momentum, L\u22a5 , is not an exact integral of motion in the currently\nadopted Galactic potential (which consists of a disk and halo component), thus its use may\nnot be generally appropriate for the study of kinematic substructures in the halo. Rather, the\nso-called third integral, I3 , which is related to L\u22a5 in a non-spherical potential, should be used.\nUnfortunately, no general analytic expression exists for I3 . However, the St\u00e4ckel form of the\ncurrently adopted potential allows one to estimate I3 in an explicit manner (de Zeeuw 1985; de\nZeeuw, Peletier, & Franx 1986; Dejonghe & de Zeeuw 1988), as well as other integrals, such as\nthe orbital energy E and the angular momentum Lz . Expressions for these three integrals are\ndescribed in the Appendix.\nFor a spherically symmetric potential, the quantity (2I3 )1/2 is equivalent to L\u22a5 . Figure 16 is\na plot of (2I3 )1/2 vs. Lz (panel a), and |E| vs Lz diagram (panel b), respectively, for the 723 stars\nfrom our sample with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121 and D \u2264 2.5 kpc. Filled and open circles denote the stars in\nthe \"clump\" and \"trail\" regions of Figure 15, respectively. We note that one star in the \"clump\"\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nregion of Figure 15 (HD 214161) exhibits quite different orbital parameters than the others (see\nbelow), so this star is drawn as a cross in Figure 16. The fact that we see such similar structures\nin Figures 15 and 16 implies that, along the orbits of the stars constituting the \"clump\" and\n\"trail\", the gravitational potential can be regarded as nearly spherical \u2013 the member stars spend\nthe majority of their orbits far from the Galactic plane, where the effect of the disk potential is\nmodest. Also, panel (b) suggests that the orbital energies |E| of the stars in the \"clump\" are\nconfined to the narrow range near |E| \u2243 105 km2 s\u22122 , whereas the stars in the \"trail\" have a\nrather diverse range of |E|.\nAnother choice of integrals in the current mass model are the so-called action integrals, J.\nAction integrals are adiabatic invariants, and thus remain unchanged even if the orbital energy\nE changes via gravitational interaction, provided the time scale for the interaction is sufficiently\nlong compared to the orbital period. One of the actions is J\u03c6 , which is equivalent to Lz in an\naxisymmetric potential. Other suitable actions in the current St\u00e4ckel potential, defined in terms\nof the spheroidal coordinates (\u03bb, \u03bd), are (J\u03bb , J\u03bd ) (see the Appendix for complete definitions).\nPanels (c) and (d) of Figure 16 show the distribution of our sample stars in the J\u03bd vs J\u03bb and\nJ\u03bd vs Lz diagrams, respectively. It can been seen that all of the \"clump\" stars, except for the\nstar HD 214161 (J\u03bb = 5058, J\u03bd = 1223), exhibit a clear clumpiness in action space, whereas the\n\"trail\" stars show a broad distribution in J\u03bd , but with a rather narrow distribution in J\u03bb [with the\nexception of the star CS Ser (J\u03bb = 6957, J\u03bd = 587)].\nFrom these integrals of motion, we conclude that the \"clump\" consists of only 9 stars, instead\nof 12 stars in the HWdZZ result, and the \"trail\" consists of 9 stars. The kinematic quantities for\nthese stars are listed in Table 6. The orbit of the \"clump\" is characterized by Zmax \u223c 16 kpc,\nrap \u223c 20 kpc, and rpr \u223c 7 kpc, which are in good agreement with the HWdZZ result. Note that\neven though we have tripled the numbers of stars considered in our present sample (728 stars),\nrelative to that of the sample examined by HWdZZ (275 stars), the number of detected clump\nmembers has not increased. Thus, HWdZZ's conclusion that as much as one-tenth of the halo\nstars presently located in the solar neighborhood originates from a single object may not apply.\nWe have not considered, as of yet, the impact of the \"trail\" stars on this argument.\nFigure 17 shows the metallicity distribution of the stars in the \"clump\" (solid histogram) and\nin the \"trail\" (dotted histogram) features. The two features seem to share a similar metallicity\ndistribution, though the number of stars involved is still too small for any definite conclusion to\nbe reached. It might be tempting to suggest that the \"trail\" was formed via the tidal interaction\nof the precursor object of the \"clump\" with the Galactic potential, with the \"trail\" stars gaining\nsome of the orbital angular momentum lost by the precursor object. Such an interaction may have\nproceeded in a rapid manner, being comparable to the orbital period of the object, so that the\nactions of the \"trail\" differ from those of the \"clump\". Progress on evaluation of this picture will\nrequire detailed numerical simulations, which we are presently investigating.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n6.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nWe have analyzed both the local and global kinematics of 1203 metal-poor stars in the Galaxy\nwith [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22120.6, based on a large, revised, catalog of stars selected without kinematic bias\n(Paper II). All of these stars have available distance estimates, radial velocities, proper motions,\nand abundance estimates over the full applicable range in the Milky Way. This is the largest\nnon-kinematically selected sample yet assembled, so the derived kinematic properties are the least\naffected by systematics as well as statistical fluctuations. We summarize our results below, and\ndiscuss them in the context of the formation of the Galaxy.\n\n6.1.\n\nSummary of the Results\n\nThe local kinematics of the halo population, based on the stars with [Fe/H]\n\u2264 \u22122.2 and |Z| < 1 kpc, are characterized by a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid\n(\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (141 \u00b1 11, 106 \u00b1 9, 94 \u00b1 8) km s\u22121 and a small prograde rotation < V\u03c6 >= 30 \u223c 50\nkm s\u22121 (assuming VLSR = 220 km s\u22121 ). When additional halo stars at larger |Z| are taken into\naccount, the velocity ellipsoid remains essentially unchanged, but < V\u03c6 > exhibits a marked\ndecrease (Figs. 2 and 3). We find no evidence for an increase of \u03c3W at the lowest abundances, as\nhad been previously suggested. At higher metallicities, the stars in our sample exhibit disk-like\nkinematics, and a higher mean rotation. Specifically, for stars in the abundance interval \u22120.7 \u2264\n[Fe/H] < \u22120.6 and with |Z| < 1 kpc, we have obtained (\u03c3U , \u03c3V , \u03c3W ) = (46 \u00b1 4, 50 \u00b1 4, 35 \u00b1 3)\nkm s\u22121 and < V\u03c6 >= 200 km s\u22121 , which characterize the kinematic parameters of the thick\ndisk. We have also confirmed previous results that there exists a remarkable discontinuity of the\nrotational properties of the Galaxy at [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22121.7 (Fig. 3).\nAnalysis of a large sample of non-kinematically selected stars provides clear evidence,\nsupporting earlier suspicions based on much smaller samples, that there exists no correlation\nbetween metal abundances and orbital eccentricities for metal-poor stars of the Milky Way (Fig.\n5). Even at the lowest abundances explored in our sample, [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2, about 20% of the stars\nhave e < 0.4. In addition, there is a small concentration of high-e stars at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7, which is\npossibly responsible for the near zero < V\u03c6 > at the same metallicity. We found that the fraction\nof the low-eccentricity stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2 remains the same, even as one changes the range\nof |Z| (Fig. 6a), so such stars belong to the halo, not the MWTD component. On the other hand,\nstars in intermediate abundance ranges above \u22122.2 dex exhibit a decrease of low-e stars with\nincreasing |Z|, and the fraction of such stars appears to converge at high |Z| to that found for\n[Fe/H] \u2264 \u22122.2 (Fig. 6b). Both a KS test and a Monte Carlo simulation enable a determination\nof the structural parameters of the disk component in these abundance ranges. Specifically, the\nfraction of the disk component is about 30% for \u22121.7 < [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121, but is less than 10% for\nmore metal-poor ranges (Fig. 8).\nThe global kinematics of the halo stars are summarized as follows. In contrast to the claims\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nof Majewski (1992), and Carney et al. (1996), stars in our sample do not show a net retrograde\nrotation at large Zmax , but rather exhibit a near zero systematic rotation (Fig. 10). The difference\nbetween our result and that of Carney et al. (1996) probably arises from the (unavoidable)\nkinematic bias inherent in their sample selection criteria. The observed decrease of < V\u03c6 > with\nincreasing Zmax is continuous, so that it is not possible to conclude that the inner \"contracted\"\npopulation (with a positive < V\u03c6 >) is distinct from an outer \"accreted\" population, based on the\nrotational properties of the metal-poor stars alone. Our analysis of the global density distribution\nof halo stars, based on the reconstruction method developed by SLZ, confirms SLZ's conclusion\nthat the outer halo is quite round (Fig. 12). However, we see no evidence of an overlapping\nflattened component in addition to the main, nearly spherical one, as was claimed by SLZ. Rather,\nthe density distribution of the halo is better described as nearly spherical in the outer region\n(beyond R = 15 \u2212 20 kpc) and highly flattened in the inner region.\nWe have confirmed a recent detection of kinematic substructure in the solar neighborhood by\nHWdZZ, based on a small number of stars which cluster together in the halo angular momentum\ndiagram. We have also found an additional elongated \"trail\" which appears to connect between\nHWdZZ's \"clump\" and the high Lz region (Fig. 14). Further analysis, using several integrals of\nmotion for the \"clump,\" does not result in a dramatic increase in the numbers of stars associated\nwith it, even though the total number of our sample stars is three times as large as that available\nto HWdZZ.\n\n6.2.\n\nImplications for the Formation of the Galaxy\n\nThe local and global kinematics of metal-poor stars provide valuable clues for understanding\nthe formation process of the halo and thick disk components in the Galaxy, as well as in disk-type\ngalaxies in general.\nIf the primordial collapse from the halo to the disk occurred in a monolithic manner, starting\nfrom an overdense homogeneous spheroid, one might expect (as predicted by the ELS model) to\nobserve a continuous increase of < V\u03c6 > for the stars born from the infalling gas, as well as a\ncontinuous decrease of their orbital eccentricities with increasing [Fe/H] as the spheroid spins up\nin order to conserve angular momentum. The fact that we observe no correlation between [Fe/H]\nand e, and basically no change of < V\u03c6 > with abundance for stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.7 conflicts\nwith this scenario. The lack of an abundance gradient in the halo stars (Carney et al. 1990; CY)\nis also difficult to interpret in this context. The outer halo, if formed from a monolithic collapse,\nmight be expected to be dominated by radially elongated motions of the stars, but this is actually\nopposite to the inferred tangentially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid at large distance from the Sun\n(see Sommer-Larsen et al. 1997). We also note that a small portion of the metal-poor stars having\n[Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7 may have been formed from the infalling part of gas, so as to explain both the\nnearly zero < V\u03c6 > and the excess number of high-e stars found at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nIf the halo is assembled from merging and/or accretion of numerous fragments falling into\nthe Galaxy (SZ), one might expect little or no correlation between kinematic and chemical\nproperties, as each fragment has its own chemical history, and the merging process may proceed\nin a chaotic manner. Our results for the < V\u03c6 > vs. [Fe/H] and [Fe/H] vs. e relations are\nbasically in agreement with this scenario. The SZ scenario is also consistent with a several Gyr\nage spread in globular clusters in the outer halo (see, e.g., Rosenberg et al. 1999), and even in\nfield stars (Schuster & Nissen 1989), because the initiation and duration of star formation may\nnot be coherent from fragment to fragment3 . However, the original SZ scenario seems unlikely\nto explain our observed vertical gradient of < V\u03c6 > for halo stars, as well as the highly flattened\ndensity distribution of the inner halo, in contrast to the nearly spherical outer halo. Totally\nincoherent, chaotic merging of SZ fragments would not be expected to produce these \"internal\"\nkinematic structures in the halo. It is also unclear as to how the rapidly rotating disk component\nsubsequently formed out of the aftermath of merging (see also Freeman 1996).\nSZ first suggested that at least the inner part of the halo may have undergone a coherent\ncontraction in a manner similar to the ELS hypothesis, an idea which has been invoked by\nsubsequent workers to explain the duality of the density, kinematics, and ages of the halo field\nstars (e.g., SLZ; Norris 1994; Carney et al. 1996; Sommer-Larsen et al. 1997), as well as the age\ndifference between outer and inner globular clusters (Zinn 1996; Rosenberg et al. 1999). This sort\nof hybrid picture, combining aspects of both the ELS and SZ scenarios, proposes that the outer\nhalo is made up from merging and/or accretion of subgalactic objects, such as dwarf-type satellite\ngalaxies, whereas the inner part of the halo has undergone a dissipative contraction on relatively\nshort timescales. This hybrid model might explain our identification of the inner, flattened, slowly\nrotating component of the halo with a finite spatial gradient in < V\u03c6 >.\nAn alternative hypothesis to explain an observed \"duality\" of the Galactic halo relies on\nthe existence of a thick-disk population of stars even at rather low abundances (MFF; Norris\n1994; BSL). If stars with disk-like kinematics have a metallicity distribution which extends below\n[Fe/H] = \u22122, then a finite fraction of their orbits would be characterized by low e, as found in our\npresent investigation. One possible origin of this MWTD component may be the heating of the\npre-existing thin disk triggered by the dissipationless merging of a satellite falling into the disk\n(Quinn, Hernquist, & Fullagar 1993). Under this hypothesis, the currently observed thin disk, with\na vertical scale height of \u223c 350 pc, could only have formed after the merging event was completed.\nHowever, our finding that few thick-disk stars exist with [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.7, and no observed increase\nof \u03c3W with decreasing [Fe/H], belies the existence of a dynamically hot, proto-disk population at\nthe lowest abundances (see also Norris 1994; Ryan & Lambert 1995; Twarog & Anthony-Twarog\n1996). Furthermore, following the results presented in \u00a74.2, we see no evidence for an overlapping\n3\n\nHarris et al. (1997) showed that the most metal-poor globular clusters, such as M92, have essentially the same\nage everywhere in the halo. As they argued, this result could also be explained within the precepts of the SZ scenario\nif all of the \"SZ fragments\" began building the first generation of clusters in the same time period.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nflattened component of the halo in addition to a nearly spherical component. An indication that\nthere might exist a significant vertical gradient in < V\u03c6 > for [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.7, compared with\na much smaller gradient observed for the thick disk itself, also conflicts with this hypothesis.\nThus, we conclude that the formation of the inner flattened halo possibly involves a dissipative\ncontraction, not a dissipationless heating of the proto-disk.\nIf a hybrid halo formation picture, based on dissipationless merging in the outer halo and\ndissipative contraction in the inner halo, applies, the question arises as to whether there is a\nclear boundary distinguishing the two regions. The results presented in \u00a74 suggest no clear\ndistinction between the outer and inner regions of the halo, at least as seen from inspection of the\n< V\u03c6 > vs. Zmax relation, and the inferred globafl density distribution of the halo. Furthermore,\nthere presently exists no reasonable theoretical explanation for the existence of two distinct\npopulations of stars in the halo. Thus, our current analysis implies that both dissipationless and\ndissipative processes in the outer and inner halo, respectively, may have occurred more or less in a\nsimultaneous manner.\nWe now ask whether the above hybrid scenario is a natural consequence of the currently\nfavored theory of galaxy formation based on hierarchical assembly of cold dark matter (CDM)\nhalos (e.g., Peacock 1999). The CDM model postulates that initial density fluctuations in the\nearly Universe have larger amplitudes on smaller scales. Thus, the initially overdense regions that\nend up forming large galaxies such as our own contain large density fluctuations on subgalactic\nscales. As a protogalaxy collapses from the general cosmological expansion, these small-scale\nfluctuations develop into numerous clumps of CDM particles, into which the interstellar gas falls\nfrom gravitational attraction. The protogalaxy is thus made up of numerous clumps comprised\nof a mixture of primordial gas and dark matter, interacting with one another via their mutual\ngravitational attraction. According to numerical simulations by Steinmetz & M\u00fcller (1994;\n1995) and Bekki & Chiba (1999), most of the metal-poor stars which presently occupy the outer\nhalo of our Galaxy form in these local, small-scale density fluctuations. Once star formation\ninitiates, the gas inside of these small fragments quickly escapes due to energy feedback from\nsupernovae. Later, these clumps begin to merge with one another, and the aftermath of these\nessentially dissipationless merging processes exhibits a nearly spherical density distribution with\nno abundance gradient.\nThe subsequent evolution of the system may be described in the following way (Bekki &\nChiba 1999). As a consequence of the merging of low-mass fragments, a smaller number of more\nmassive clumps develops \u2013 within each of these merged clumps one expects to find previously\nformed metal-poor stars as well as newly born stars. These large clumps continue to accrete gas\nfrom their immediate surroundings. These clumps gradually move toward the central region of the\nsystem due to both dynamical friction, and dissipative merging with smaller clumps. Then, when\nthe last merging event between the largest clumps occurs, the stars which have been confined\ninside the clumps are disrupted and spread over the inner part of the halo, whereas a large fraction\nof the disrupted gas appears to end up in the center of the Galaxy and may form a bulge. As a\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nconsequence, the inner part of the halo should have a flattened density distribution with a finite\nprograde rotation, as reported here, and its angular momentum distribution may be similar to\nthat of the bulge (Wyse & Gilmore 1992). Also, the stars born from this infalling stage of gas\nmay explain the existence of high-e stars at [Fe/H] \u223c \u22121.7. The simulations conducted to date\nimply that the thick disk component is partially composed of debris stars, but it is mainly made\nfrom diluted gas which has been accreted from the outer part of the halo (Sommer-Larsen et al.\n1997). Therefore, although more detailed simulation work is required, CDM models appear to\nreproduce, at least qualitatively, the overall kinematic properties of the metal-poor stars via both\ndissipationless merging in the outer halo, and dissipative merging in the inner halo.\nIt is unknown whether or not evidence for merging events of CDM clumps during the early\nevolution of the Galaxy might be still preserved as kinematic substructures at the current epoch.\nWithin the currently available precision of space velocities for stars in our sample, typically of the\norder of 10 to 20 km s\u22121 , the main body of the halo appears to be well mixed in phase space;\nhigher precision measurements of proper motions by the planned astrometric satellites missions\n(e.g., FAME, SIM, GAIA) may be able to disentangle this complex mixture of halo stars (Helmi,\nZhao & de Zeeuw 1999). Alternatively, the confirmed kinematic clumping of halo stars presented\nin \u00a75 may originate from the recent accretion of a satellite galaxy, which has fallen into the Galaxy\nafter the major part of the halo was formed.\nFirmer conclusions on the formation of the Galaxy require the assembly and analysis of still\nlarger numbers of stars with accurate distances and proper motions, especially at larger distances\nfrom the Sun. Exploration along this line is now in progress. More elaborate numerical modeling\nof the formation of large spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way is also needed in order to clarify\nthe physical processes that lead to the currently observed dynamics and structure of the halo and\ndisk components. It is of particular importance to model and understand the chemo-dynamical\nevolution of the system of subgalactic fragments in the course of the Galaxy's collapse. Once a\nfundamental understanding of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy is established, it will\nthen be possible to obtain additional insights into formation of disk-type galaxies in general, by\ncombining our refined picture with the rapidly growing observational database of young galaxies\nbecoming available in the deep realm of the Universe.\nWe are grateful to the referee, Bruce Carney, for his careful review of the paper and a number\nof thoughtful suggestions.

For more details, see, e.g., de Zeeuw (1985),\nDejonghe & de Zeeuw (1988), and SLZ.\nWe define spheroidal coordinates (\u03bb, \u03c6, \u03bd), where \u03c6 corresponds to the azimuthal angle in\ncylindrical coordinates (R, \u03c6, Z), and \u03bb and \u03bd are the roots for \u03c4 of\nR2\nZ2\n+\n=1,\n\u03c4 +\u03b1 \u03c4 +\u03b3\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b3 are constants, giving \u2212\u03b3 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 \u2212\u03b1 \u2264 \u03bb. The coordinate surfaces are spheroids\n(\u03bb = const.) and hyperboloids of revolution (\u03bd = const.) with the Z-axis as the rotation axis,\nwhere the focal distance \u039b = (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1)1/2 fixes the coordinate system.\nThe gravitational potential of the St\u00e4ckel type is then written as\n\u03c6(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u2212\n\n(\u03bb + \u03b3)G(\u03bb) \u2212 (\u03bd + \u03b3)G(\u03bd)\n,\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere G(\u03c4 ) is an arbitrary function. In this work, G(\u03c4 ) is the sum of Gdisk (\u03c4 ) from the disk and\nGhalo (\u03c4 ) from the massive dark halo. Following SLZ, we adopt the oblate perfect spheroid for\nGdisk (\u03c4 ) and the s = 2 model of de Zeeuw, Peletier, & Franx (1986) for Ghalo (\u03c4 ).\nThe Hamiltonian, H, per unit mass, for motion in this potential \u03c6(\u03bb, \u03bd) is\nH=\n\np2\u03c6\np2\u03bd\np2\u03bb\n+\n+\n+ \u03c6(\u03bb, \u03bd) ,\n2P 2 2R2 2Q2\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere P and Q are the metric coefficients of the spheroidal coordinates, given by\nP2 =\n\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n, Q2 = \u2212\n,\n4(\u03bb + \u03b1)(\u03bb + \u03b3)\n4(\u03bd + \u03b1)(\u03bd + \u03b3)\n\n(A4)\n\nand p\u03bb , p\u03c6 , and p\u03bd are the conjugate momenta to \u03bb, \u03c6, and \u03bd, respectively,\np\u03bb = P 2 \u03bb\u0307 = P v\u03bb , p\u03c6 = R2 \u03c6\u0307 = Rv\u03c6 , p\u03bd = Q2 \u03bd\u0307 = Qv\u03bd .\n\n(A5)\n\nThe velocities v\u03bb , v\u03c6 , and v\u03bd at a point (\u03bb, \u03c6, \u03bd) are the components of the velocity v along the\northogonal axis defined locally by the spheroidal coordinate system.\nThe three integrals of motion, |E|, I2 , and I3 , are defined as\n|E| = \u2212H\nL2z\nI2 =\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nG(\u03bb) \u2212 G(\u03bd)\n1\n1 2\n(Lx + L2y ) + \u22062 vz2 \u2212 Z 2\n,\nI3 =\n2\n2\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n\n(A6)\n(A7)\n(A8)\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nand the action integrals J\u03bb , J\u03c6 , and J\u03bd are defined as\nJ\u03bb =\nJ\u03c6 =\nJ\u03bd\n\n=\n\n1\n2 \u03bb2\np\u03bb d\u03bb =\np\u03bb d\u03bb\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0 \u03bb1\nI\n1\np\u03c6 d\u03c6 = Lz\n2\u03c0\nI\nZ\n2 \u03bd0\n1\np\u03bd d\u03bd =\np\u03bd d\u03bd ,\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0 \u2212\u03b3\nI\n\nZ\n\n(A9)\n(A10)\n(A11)\n\nwhere (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) and \u03bd0 are the turning points of the orbit, defined as the values for which v\u03bb = 0\nand v\u03bd = 0, respectively, and \u03bd = \u2212\u03b3 defines the equatorial plane.
