Here we investigate the extension of this model to the growth of solid malignant\ntumors. A variety of in vitro and in vivo data are analyzed and compared with the prediction\nof a 'universal' law, relating properly rescaled tumor masses and tumor growth times. The\nresults support the notion that tumor growth follows such a universal law. Several important\nimplications of this finding are discussed, including its relevance for tumor metastasis and\nrecurrence, cell turnover rates, angiogenesis and invasion.\n\nA better understanding of the growth kinetics of malignant tumors is of paramount\nimportance for the development of more successful treatment strategies. Given the lack of clinical\ndata at non-symptomatic stages, it has been conjectured, that in most solid malignant human tumors\ntwo or three decades elapse between the first carcinogenic stimulus and the clinical emergence of\nthe neoplasm (Tubiana, 1986). Since a tumor is clinically detectable with conventional diagnostic\ntools at approximately 1 cm3 in volume, representing a population of about 1 billion cells, some 30\ncell doublings from the progenitory cancer cell must occur in order to reach this 'diagnostic' stage.\nAssuming typical volume doubling times of about 100 days, this scenario corresponds to a\npreclinical time of roughly 8 years . In the next 10 volume doublings up to about 103 cm3 in size\n(which is reportedly lethal in primary breast cancer by Retsky, 1997), the clinical history of the\ntumor passes through a microscopic, avascular growth phase, followed by angiogenesis, necessary\nto sustain a macroscopic size (Folkman, 1971).Continuous tumor progression leads then eventually\nto local tissue invasion and metastasis, depending on the particular cancer type.\nA recent paper from West et al (2001) shows that, regardless of the different masses and\ndevelopment times, mammals, birds, fish and molluscs all share a common growth pattern.\nProvided that masses and growth times for the different organisms are properly rescaled, the same\nuniversal exponential curve fits their ontogenetic growth data. The authors explain this phenomenon\nwith basic cellular mechanisms (West et al, 2002), assuming a common fractal pattern in the\nvascularization of the investigated taxa.\nSince rapid volumetric growth and neovascularization are also hallmarks of solid malignant\ntumors, it is intriguing to investigate whether tumor growth follows the same universal curve. For\nthis purpose we rescale tumor sizes and growth times according to West's recipe (West et al, 2001),\nwhich we briefly recall here. Instead of the actual mass, m, they use the ratio r = (m/M)0.25 , where\nM is the asymptotic mass for the taxon; r relates to the relative proportion of total energy\nexpenditure, which is required to ensure maintenance. Likewise, instead of the actual time, t, these\nauthors use the rescaled dimensionless time\n2\n\n\f\u03c4 =\n\n1\nm\naM \u2212 0.25t \u2212 ln (1 \u2212 ( 0 ) 0. 25 ) = \u03b1 r0t \u2212 ln (1 \u2212 r0 )\n4\nM\n[1]\n\nwhere r0 = (m 0 /M)0.25 , m0 is the mass at birth, \u03b1 = 0.25 a m0\n\n\u20130.25\n\nand a is a parameter, which is\n\nroughly constant within a taxon and proportional to the organism's metabolic rate across taxa. The\nvalues of a, m0 and M are reported for many different species in West et al (2001). Using the\nvariables \u03c4 and r , this 'universal' growth law follows:\n\nr = 1 \u2013 exp (-\u03c4)\n\n[2]\n\nIn our case, m0 and M are the initial and final masses of the tumor, and a is a parameter expected to\nbe related to the tumor's characteristics (e.g., its ability to metastasize or invade, or its affinity for\nnutrients uptake). Since the definition of the parameters is non-trivial, a multistep fitting procedure\nis adopted for their determination. From equations [1] and [2] we obtain:\ny = - \u03b1 r0 t + y0\n\n[3]\n\nwhere y = ln (1 \u2013 r) , y0 = ln (1 \u2013 r0 ). Available data normally provide m as a function of t during\nthe tumor's growth phase. For our fitting procedure, the lowest and largest values of m are first\nassumed for m0 and M, respectively, thus yielding a preliminary estimate for y0 and \u03b1. Then m0 and\nM are allowed to respectively decrease and increase, and y0 and \u03b1 reestimated until a best-fit\n(consistent with the available biological infomation) is obtained.\nFor our analysis, we have used available data from the literature, spanning in vitro\nexperiments (multicellular tumor spheroids (Chignola et al, 2000, Nirmala et al, 2001) as well as in\nvivo data (both, from animal models (Steel, 1977; Cividalli et al, 2002) and patients(Norton, 1988;\nYorke et al, 1993). The results are presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and plotted against\nequation [2]. The data fit the universal growth curve very well. Table 1 presents an estimate of the\nrelevant parameters and, further supporting our claim, shows very high R2 correlation coefficients\nbetween actual and fitted data.\nIn the following, we will briefly discuss possible implications of our conjecture that tumor\ngrowth also follows a universal law.\n\n3\n\n\fa) tumor metastasis and recurrence. Some forty years ago Romsdahl et al. (1961) had\nproposed that, upon reaching a certain \"critical\" volume of the primary tumor, metastatic\ndissemination would start. Tubiana (1986) evaluated this threshold for breast cancer, and showed\nthat it critically depends on the axillary lymph-node involvement. The hypothesis that metastatic\nbehaviour could be associated with a universal growing phase of the tumor is corroborated by\nexperimental evidence. For example, data from C3Hf/Sed mice inoculated with fibrosarcoma\n(FSall) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) (Ramsay et al, 1988) show that, if primary tumors\nare treated upon reaching a diameter of 6 mm, the maximal percentage of metastasis is only 3.1% in\nFSall and 8.0% in SCCVII, while it increases to 14.3% and 41.3%, respectively, if the treatment\nstarts at a diameter of 12 mm. When local recurrence of the same tumor lines are considered, the\npercentage of metastasis, at a tumor diameter of 6 mm, is only 12.5% in FSall and 43.0% in\nSCCVII, respectively, versus 46.6% and 70.3% at a diameter of 12 mm. Furthermore, the diameter\ndoubling time (\u00b1 standard deviation) necessary to grow from 6 to 12 mm increases from \u2206 t p =6.6 (\u00b1\n0.4) days in primary to \u2206 t r=13.6 (\u00b1 4.6) days in recurrent Fsall tumors, and from \u2206 t p =7.7 (\u00b1 0.5)\ndays to \u2206 t r=12.8 (\u00b1 3.8) days in SCCVII, respectively. An approximate computation from our\nmodel yields \u2206 t r / \u2206 t p ~ 1.7, which is in agreement with experimental results from Ramsay et al\n(1988). Hence, the recurrent cancer grows much slower than the primary tumor. Following the\nnotion of a universal law, a possible explanation for this behavior is that the residual clonogenic\ncells of the primary tumor, which lead to recurrence, generate cells belonging to an 'older'\ndevelopmental phase.\n\nb) cell turnover rates. As another consequence of the model, the relative amount of energy\ndevoted to tumor growth, R = 1 \u2013 r can be related to the proportion \u2206N/N of the cells contributing\nto the growth at any 'rescaled time', \u03c4 :\n\nR = exp( \u2212\u03c4 ) \u2248\n\n\u2206N\nN\n\n[4]\n\nHere, N is the total number of tumor cells and \u2206N is the difference between the rates of newly\ngenerated tumor cells (growth fraction (GF)) and tumor cells being lost (i.e., cell loss factor (CLF),\nwhich includes both cell death and cell invasion). Eq. [4] predicts that \u2206N is larger at the onset of\ntumor growth, and decreases exponentially afterwards. In fact, data from glioblastoma spheroids\n(Nirmala et al, 2001) suggest values for \u2206N/N ranging from 0.9 at 1 week to 0.35 after 4 weeks.\nMoreover, knowing the rate of cell turnover at any developmental stage can help to improve\n4\n\n\ftherapeutic strategies. As such, we may define the 'lethal' dose of a given therapeutic agent as the\ndose D for which the rate of tumor growth post treatment, GF(D) equals the rate of CLF. GF(D)\ndepends then on both the developmental stage of the tumor (i.e., \u03c4) and on its therapeutical\nresponse. If we further assume a given survival fraction SF(D) (different for each tumor), when a\ndose D has been administered, then GF(D) should become equal to the GF of the untreated tumor\nmultiplied by SF(D). There is, however, a threshold time (corresponding to the \"critical\" tumor\nvolume at inception of metastasis), before which the dose D is curative, while later it can only be\nlocally effective. A longitudinal study of the metastasis-free survival in prostate carcinoma (Fuks et\nal, 1991) in 679 patients has shown that after 5, 10 and 15 years the percent survival of local control\n(LC) cases was 90%, 82% and 77%, respectively, while for local failure (LF) cases it was 68%,\n39% and 24%, respectively. One could therefore argue that the LC tumors were correctly treated\n(i.e., at doses larger than the lethal one) early on and that only in a small percentage of patients was\nthe metastasis threshold already surpassed at the time of treatment. Conversely, LF doses were\ninadequate and therefore, as the tumor mass continues to grow, metastases were inevitable.\n\nc) angiogenesis. It is noteworthy that West 's model applies to organisms growing in\nunrestricted dietary conditions. Correspondingly, only fully replenished tumors should follow the\nuniversal growth curve. And in fact, as Freyer and Sutherland (1986) pointed out, differences in\ngrowth rates and saturation sizes (of up to a factor of 500) were found comparing tumor spheroids\ncultured in media with different oxygen and glucose concentrations. As such, deviations from the\nuniversal curve are conceivable depending on the particular environmental conditions. Our\nformalism may yield a simple mathematical explanation for such growth behavior. From the\ndefinition of r follows:\n\ndr / dM = \u2212\n\n1\n\u22c5 (m / M 5 ) 0.25 < 0\n4\n\n[5]\n\nlikewise, from the expression of M as a function of the metabolic rate in West et al (2001) of a\nsingle cell Bc we deduce that also\n\ndM / dB c < 0\n\n[6]\n\nThus, if the average value of Bc decreases, such as due to the depletion of a e.g. non-replenished\nnutrient concentration, the r curve is bound to shift downwards. Therefore, as \"ontogenetic\" tumor\ngrowth should depend on the availability of nutrient replenishment or, in vivo, on the successful\n5\n\n\fcompetitition for available nutrients, any marked deviation between the universal and the real\ngrowth curve may indicate the amount of additional nutrients necessary to satisfy the metabolic\ndemand of the growing tumor. Accordingly, one can further hypothesize that in vivo the degree of\ndeviation from the universal curve may in fact relate to the amount of paracrine endothelial cell\ngrowth factors (e.g., VEGF (Plate et al, 1992; Shweiki et al, 1992) released by the nutrient-deprived\ntumor cells in order to induce the extent of neovascularization necessary to provide the required\nlevel of nutrient replenishment. It is noteworthy that the importance of nutrient availability has been\npointed out also by a model proposed by Delsanto et al. (2000) and Scalerandi et al (1999, 2001)\nwhere, following the Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) (Schechter et al, 1994), a\nconsistent set of rules governing the microscopic interactions (at the cellular level) has been\nformulated, amenable to direct numerical simulations of cancer growth both in the avascular and\nvascular case.\nd) Invasion. Finally, our findings also relate to cell motility, another hallmark of malignant\ntumors. Extracellular matrix-degrading invasive cells are likely to decrease the mechanical\nconfinement around the tumor. These cells also appear to follow specific routes of dissemination,\nwhich include the perivascular space in the case of malignant astrocytomas (Bernstein et al, 1989;\nVajkoczy et al, 1999). As such, at least in this case, tissue invasion should facilitate further growth\nby reducing the constraint of confinement not only for the volumetrically expanding tumor itself but\nalso for the aforementioned chemo-attracted endothelial cells, which migrate towards the\nangiogenic factor releasing tumor cells. Thus, a progressive decrease in Bc may not only trigger an\nincrease in (e.g.) VEGF secretion, but could also induce an increase in the extent and dynamics of\ntissue invasion, which in turn facilitates angiogenesis and ensures continuing tumor growth.\nTherefore, not only metastasis and angiogenesis but also tumor cell invasion may be linked to a\n\"critical\" tumor volume, as has already previously been argued on the basis of experimental\nfindings from human glioma spheroids (Deisboeck et al, 2001).\nIn summary, we have investigated the applicability of West's general model for the\nontogenetic growth of living organisms to the case of solid malignant tumors. The results from\nfitting a variety of in vitro data from multicellular tumor spheroids and of in vivo data from both\nexperimental models as well as patients support the notion that neoplasms also follow a universal\ngrowth law. Our paradigm-shifting finding has far-reaching implications concerning the mechanism\nof tumor metastasis and recurrence, cell turnover, angiogenesis and invasion.\n.\n\n6\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The work has been partially supported by the 'Compagnia di S.\nPaolo', Torino, Italy.

Tumor growth curves (replenished multicellular tumor spheroids). r = (m/M) 0.25 vs the\n'rescaled' time \u03c4 for various multicellular spheroids. Rat gliosarcoma (9L) and human glioblastoma\n(U118) were cultured over 60 days on agarose with the medium superlayer routinely replaced every\nseven days (Chignola et al, 2000). The fitting lines were obtained by the same authors using a\nGompertzian model. Data from another human glioblastoma line (SNB19) (Nirmala et al, 2001),\ncultured over a shorter time (30 days, with the cell culture medium replenished once every other\nday) and reaching a maximum volume of about 0.15 mm3 are also included. In spite of the different\ndimensions (after 30 days, the 9L and U118 spheroids measured 0.5 mm3 and 0.9 mm3 ,\nrespectively), all data fit well eq.[2], which is also plotted for reference.\n\nFig. 2. Tumor growth curves (rodent models). Fibroadenoma (Fibro) and Walker carcinoma\n(Walker) were transplanted into rats: their initial tumor volumes ranged from 0.1 (Walker) to 1 cm3\n(Fibro), and final volumes approached 100 cm3 after 180 days and 25 days, respectively (Steel,\n1977). The other murine tumors: a mammary adenocarcinoma (KHJJ), a mammary carcinoma\n(C3H), a sarcoma (EMT6) and two osteosarcomas (NCTC2472 and osteo) had initial volumes\nranging between 0.001 and 0.05 cm3 and final volumes of 1 to 5 cm3 , after an elapsed time between\n9\n\n\f15 and 100 days, depending on the tumor (Steel, 1977). Additional data on another murine\nmammary carcinoma (Ch3 ISS) (Cividalli et al, 2002) are also included. Eq [2] is again plotted for\nreference.\n\nFig. 3. Tumor growth curves (breast and prostate tumors from patients). Data are extrapolated using\nthe Gompertzian curve parameters (Norton, 1988; Yorke et al, 1993). For patient data the analysis is\nmore difficult, since often only few observations of the same untreated tumor are available and the\ntumor's asymptomatic hystory is unknown. As in the previous figures, Eq [2] is plotted here for\nreference.\n\n10\n\n\fTABLE 1: Estimates of the relevant parameters from Figures 1-3. An asterix * in the\nsecond column denotes in vivo data. The values of the parameters m0 , M and a are estimated by\nmeans of the fitting procedure described after eq. [3].
