INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\nRS Oph is one of the well-observed recurrent novae and is\nsuggested to be a progenitor system of Type Ia supernovae\n(e.g., Hachisu & Kato 2001b). It has undergone its sixth\nrecorded outburst on 2006 February 12 UT (Narumi et al.\n2006). The five previous recorded outbursts occurred in 1898,\n1933, 1958, 1967, and 1985. These short 10 \u2212 20 yr recurrence periods indicate that the white dwarf (WD) mass is very\nclose to the Chandrasekhar mass and that the mass accretion\nrate is as large as \u1e40acc \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (see, e.g., Fig.2\nof Hachisu & Kato 2001b). If the WD mass increases after\neach outburst, RS Oph will eventually explode as a Type Ia\nsupernova (e.g., Nomoto 1982; Hachisu et al. 1996, 1999a;\nHachisu & Kato 2001b). Therefore, it is important to estimate the WD mass and the accreted mass left on the WD after\nthe outburst.\nIt is well known that the X-ray turnoff time is a good indicator of the WD mass (e.g., Hachisu & Kato 2005, 2006a).\nWhen the hydrogen shell-burning atop the WD extinguishes,\na supersoft X-ray phase ends (e.g., Krautter et al. 1996). In\na visual light curve, however, this turnoff is not clear because\nmany strong emission lines contribute to it. To avoid such\ncontamination to the continuum flux, we have observed RS\nOph with the Str\u00f6mgren y-band filter. The y-filter is an intermediate bandpass filter designed to cut the strong emission\nlines in the wide V bandpass filter, so that its light curve rep1 Department of Earth Science and Astronomy, College of Arts and\nSciences, University of Tokyo, Komaba 3-8-1, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902,\nJapan: hachisu@chianti.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n2 Department of Astronomy, Keio University, Hiyoshi 4-1-1, Kouhoku-ku,\nYokohama 223-8521, Japan: mariko@educ.cc.keio.ac.jp\n3 Azuma 1-401-810, Tsukuba 305-0031, Japan: skiyota@nias.affrc.go.jp\n4 Numashiro 702-3, Odawara 256-0801, Japan: k_kubotera@nifty.com\n5 Department of Astronomy, School of Science, University of Tokyo,\nHongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan: maehara@provence.c.utokyo.ac.jp\n6\nTeratani 124,\nIsato,\nKumano,\nMie 519-4673,\nJapan:\nk.nakajima@ztv.ne.jp\n7 Astronomical Institute, Osaka Kyoiku University, Kashiwara-shi, Osaka\n582-8582, Japan: sadakane@cc.osaka-kyoiku.ac.jp\n\nTABLE 1\nL IST OF O BSERVERS\nname of\nobserver\n\nlocation\nin Japan\n\ntelescope\naperture\n\nobserved\nbands\n\nKiyota\nKubotera\nMaehara\nNakajima\nOKUa\n\nTsukuba\nOdawara\nKawaguchi\nKumano\nKashiwara\n\n25cm\n16cm\n20/25cm\n25cm\n51cm\n\nB,V, y, Rc , Ic\nB,V, y, Rc\nB,V, y, Rc , Ic\nB,V, y, Rc , Ic\nV, y\n\nNo. of obs.\nnights (y)\n24\n8\n19\n55\n25\n\na Osaka Kyoiku University team\n\nresents the continuum flux of novae (e.g., Hachisu & Kato\n2006b).

The light curve fitting of the observation\nwith our numerical model are presented in \u00a73. Discussion\nfollows in \u00a74.\n2. OBSERVATION\n\nOptical observations were started just after the discovery\nof the 2006 outburst (Narumi et al. 2006). Each observer and\ntheir observational details are listed in Table 1. We have put a\nspecial emphasis on the Str\u00f6mgren y-filter to avoid contamination by the strong emission lines. These y-filters were made\nby Custom Scientific Inc.8 and distributed to each observer by\none of the authors (M. Kato). Kiyota, Kubotera, Maehara, and\nNakajima (VSOLJ members) started observation on February\n13 and obtained 65 nights data for y-magnitudes (from February 17 to July 27). Osaka Kyoiku University (OKU) team obtained V and y magnitudes of 25 nights starting from February\n17 (until July 14). The magnitudes of this object were measured by using the local standard star, TYC2 5094.92.1 (Kiyota) or TYC2 5094.283.1 (the other observers).

Our y-magnitudes\nshow very small scatter and follows the bottom of the 1985\nvisual magnitude. The essential feature of the light curve is\nvery similar to the previous outbursts.\nThe y light curve, however, clearly shows a plateau phase\nfrom day 40 to day 75 and the sharp final decline starting from\nday 75. Such mid-plateau phases are also observed in two\nother recurrent novae, U Sco (e.g., Hachisu et al. 2000) and\nCI Aql (e.g., Hachisu & Kato 2001a; Hachisu et al. 2003;\nHachisu & Kato 2003a).

LIGHT CURVE MODEL\n\nOur binary model, essentially the same as that in\nHachisu & Kato (2001b) except for the free-free emission\nmodel (see below) in the early phase of the outburst, consists\nof a red giant (RG) star, which is not filling its Roche lobe, a\nwhite dwarf (WD), and a disk around the WD. A circular orbit\nwith the ephemeris given by Fekel et al. (2000) is assumed.\n3.1. Photospheric evolution of the white dwarf\n\nAfter a thermonuclear runaway sets in on a mass-accreting\nWD, its photosphere expands greatly and an optically thick\nwind massloss begins. The decay phase of novae can\nbe followed by a sequence of steady state solutions (e.g.,\nKato & Hachisu 1994). After the optically thick winds stop,\nthe envelope settles into a hydrostatic equilibrium where its\nmass is decreasing by nuclear burning. When the nuclear\nburning decays, the WD enters a cooling phase, in which\nthe luminosity is supplied with heat flow from the ash of hydrogen burning. We have followed nova evolution, using the\nsame method and numerical techniques as in Kato & Hachisu\n(1994).\nIn our nova light curve model, we assume that free-free\nemission of the optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum\nflux in the early phase of RS Oph outbursts as in many classical novae (e.g., Gallagher & Ney 1976). This is the main and\nmost important difference from previous Hachisu & Kato's\n(2001b) model, in which the blackbody emission is assumed.\nThe free-free emission of optically thin ejecta is estimated\nby equation (9) in Hachisu & Kato (2006b). The calculated\n\nF IG . 2.- Calculated light curves for free-free emission during the optically thick wind phase together with observational y- (open circles) and\nIc -magnitudes (open squares) of the 2006 outburst. We also add observational infrared K- (open triangles: taken from Evans et al. 1988) and visual magnitudes (small dots: taken from AAVSO) of the 1985 outburst. For\nthe y-magnitudes, we show six light curves for different WD masses, i.e.,\nMWD = 1.3, 1.33, 1.34, 1.35, 1.36, and 1.37 M\u2299 from right to left. For the\nIc - and K- magnitudes, we show two light curves for two WD masses, i.e.,\nMWD = 1.3 and 1.35 M\u2299 from right to left. Here we assume X = 0.5 and\nZ = 0.02 for the chemical composition of the envelope.\n\n\fHydrogen Burning Turnoff of RS Oph 2006\n\nF IG . 3.- Same as Fig. 2, but for a combination of our free-free plus disk\nirradiation models. The plateau phase is reproduced with a relatively large\ndisk, \u03b1 = 0.34, for the 50% iraddiation efficiency. The various parameters are\nsummarized in Table 2. Thin solid lines denote the free-free emission brightness (labeled by \"free-free\") or the blackbody emission luminosity (labeled\nby \"blackbody\"). Thick solid lines are the total of the free-free plus blackbody. Dash-dotted lines are the blackbody luminosity only from the WD and\nthe RG with irradiation. Several V -magnitudes in the very early phase of\nthe 2006 outburst (Open triangles) are added. We cannot reproduce the midplateau phase without a disk. The final sharp decline corresponds to the end\nof the hydrogen shell-burning.\n\nfree-free light curves are shown in Figure 2. The decline\nrate of the light curve, i.e., the evolutionary speed depends\nvery sensitively on the WD mass if its mass is very close to\nthe Chandrasekhar mass (e.g., Kato 1999; Hachisu & Kato\n2006a,b). This is because the WD radius is very sensitive to\nthe increase in mass near the Chandrasekhar mass.\nThe timescale also depends weakly on the chemical composition of envelopes. Hydrogen depletion is expected. This\nis because, just after the unstable nuclear burning sets in, convection widely develops and mixes processed helium with unburned hydrogen. This mixing reduces the hydrogen content\nby 10%\u221220% for massive WDs like in RS Oph. The CNO\nabundance is not enriched in the recurrent novae, so we adopt\nthe hydrogen content of X = 0.50 and the solar metallicity of\nZ = 0.02.\nWe added infrared K-magnitudes of the 1985 outburst observed by Evans et al. (1988). Very little dependence of the\nlight curve shape on the wavelength is a characteristic feature\nin the free-free emission light curves. However, the free-free\nlight curve cannot reproduce the mid-plateau phase, so we introduce an irradiated disk in the next subsection.\n3.2. The irradiated disk and companion\n\nWe assume an axi-symmetric disk with a size of\nRdisk = \u03b1R\u22171 ,\n\n(1)\n\nand a thickness of\nh = \u03b2Rdisk \u03c0/Rdisk\n\n\u0001\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n3\n\nF IG . 4.- The absorption-distance relation is plotted for the disk irradiation\nmodel and the companion model. Lines with open squares, open circles, and\nopen triangles denote the disk irradiation model with the efficiency of 25%,\n50%, and 100%, respectively. Each symbol corresponds to the disk size,\ni.e., \u03b1 = 0.64, 0.48, 0.32, and 0.24 from top to bottom. Lines with filled\nsquares, filled circles, filled triangles, and filled stars denote the companion\nstar model with the radius of \u03b3 = 0.25, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50, respectively.\nEach symbol corresponds to the photospheric temperature of the companion\nstar, i.e., TRG = 3200, 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3700, 3800, and 3900 K from\ntop to bottom. The absorption of AV = 3.1E(B \u2212 V ) = 2.26 is indicated by a\ndashed line (Snijders 1987). Three models in Table 2 are indicated by large\nopen stars.\n\nwhere Rdisk is the outer edge of the disk, R\u22171 is the effective\nradius of the inner critical Roche lobe for the WD component, h is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane,\n\u03c0 is the distance from the symmetry axis, and \u03bd is the power\nindex which describes flaring-up of the disk edge (see, e.g.,\nSchandl et al. 1997; Hachisu & Kato 2001b). We also assume a companion red giant star with a radius of\nRRG = \u03b3R\u22172 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere R\u22172 is the effective radius of the inner critical Roche\nlobe for the red giant component, its mass of MRG =\n0.7 M\u2299 , and the inclination angle of the binary, i = 33\u25e6 (e.g.,\nDobrzycka & Kenyon 1994). Dobrzycka et al. (1996) suggested \u03b3 \u223c 0.4 for the distance of 1.5 kpc.\nThe disk surface absorbs UV and supersoft X-ray photons\nfrom the WD and emits a part of it as a thermal emission\nwith a lower temperature than that of the WD photosphere.\nThe resultant light curve depends mainly on the disk size (\u03b1),\nthe efficiency of irradiation (\u03b7eff = radiated energy/absorbed\nenergy), and also the radius of the RG, but depends very\nweakly on the other two parameters of \u03bd and \u03b2. Here, we\nassume \u03bd = 2 and \u03b2 = 0.05. The dependence on these parameters was widely discussed in the previous papers (e.g.,\nHachisu & Kato 2001b, 2003a). The irradiation efficiency of\nthe RG hardly affects the light curve as shown in Figure 3.\nWe have obtained three best fit models of the 2006 outburst\nin Table 2. The calculated light curves for the 50% efficiency\nare plotted in Figure 3. These models reproduce the midplateau phase and the sharp final decline identified as the end\nof hydrogen shell-burning. The turnoff date of day 83 in our\n1.35 M\u2299 WD model is very consisting with the supersoft Xray turnoff on day \u223c 90 observed with Swift (Osborne et al.\n2006).\n3.3. Distance\n\nThe distance is obtained from the light curve fitting both\nat the plateau phase and at the post-outburst minimum phase\n\n\f4\n\nHachisu et al.\n\nas shown in Figures 2 and 3. The disk luminosity depends\nmostly on the disk size, \u03b1, and the irradiation efficiency, \u03b7eff .\nWe have changed these two parameters and calculated the\nbrightness at the mid-plateau phase. Fitting the calculated\nbrightness with the observation, we obtain the apparent distance moduli, i.e., (m \u2212 M)y = (m \u2212 M)V and (m \u2212 M)I . Then we\ncalculate the absorption from\nAV \u2212 AI (m \u2212 M)V \u2212 (m \u2212 M)I\n=\n,\n(4)\n0.518\n0.518\nwhere we use AI = 0.482AV (e.g., Rieke & Lebofsky 1985).\nOnce AV is obtained, the distance is calculated from log(d) =\n((m \u2212 M)V \u2212 AV \u2212 5)/5. Thus, we obtained the absorptiondistance relation for the irradiated disk as shown in Figure 4.\nWe further restrict the distance with the observed absorption\nof AV \u223c 2.3 (Snijders 1987). The same method is applied to\nthe companion star, in which we have changed the companion\nsize, \u03b3, and the effective temperature, TRG . The absorptiondistance relation for the companion is also plotted.\nThe largest ambiguity of our model is the irradiation efficiency of the disk. Here, the distances of 0.9, 1.3, and 1.7 kpc\nare derived for the three different assumed efficiency, i.e.,\n25%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. The actual efficiency is\nsomewhere between 50% and 100%, so we have a reasonable\ndistance of 1.3 \u2212 1.7 kpc.\nAV =\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe decline rate of free-free light curve and the hydrogen burning turn-off date depend not only on the WD\nmass but also on the chemical composition of the envelope\n(Hachisu & Kato 2006b). We have examined two other cases\nof hydrogen content, X = 0.70 and X = 0.35, and found\n\nthat the best fit models are obtained for MWD = 1.36 and\n1.34 M\u2299 , respectively. So we conclude that the WD mass\nis 1.35 \u00b1 0.01 M\u2299 .\nThere are still debates on the distance to RS Oph. In the\nprevious outburst, Hjellming et al. (1986) estimated the distance to be 1.6 kpc from H I absorption-line measurements.\nSnijders (1987) also obtained the distance of 1.6 kpc assuming the UV peak flux is equal to the Eddington luminosity.\nHarrison et al. (1993) calculated a distance of 1290 pc from\nthe K-band luminosity. Hachisu & Kato (2001b) obtained a\nsmaller distance of 0.6 kpc from the comparison of observed\nand theoretical UV fluxes integrated for the wavelength region of 911-3250 \u00c5 . This shorter distance is caused by their\nblackbody assumption, because the flux is much larger than\nthe blackbody flux in this wavelength region. O'Brien et al.\n(2006) estimated the distance of 1.6 kpc from VLBA mapping observation with an expansion velocity indicated from\nemission line width. Monnier et al. (2006) estimated a shorter\ndistance of < 540 pc assuming that the IR interferometry size\ncorresponds to the binary separation. If we assume this corresponds to a circumbinary disk, however, a much larger distance is obtained. Therefore, our new value of 1.3 \u2212 1.7 kpc is\nconsistent with other estimates.\n\nWe thank the Variable Star Observing League of Japan\n(VSOLJ) and the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) for the visual data of RS Oph.
