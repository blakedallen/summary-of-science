Understanding these jets may be the key\nto unraveling physics beyond the standard model. The\njets at the LHC can be coarsely partitioned into quark\nor gluon jets. Almost always, the jets we would like most\nto study are quark jets and so removing the gluon jet\nbackground, if possible, could greatly enhance the search\nreach for many new physics scenarios. In this letter, we\nshow that through a comprehensive study of light quark\n(uds) vs gluon discriminants, many of which take advantage of the improved resolution of the LHC detectors,\ngluon-tagging with good efficiency is achievable on an\nevent-by-event basis.\nThere are many situations in which quark/gluon tagging would be useful. For example, the jets produced in\nsupersymmetric decay chains are usually entirely quark\njets, while their backgrounds are mostly gluon jets.\nQuark tagging would be especially helpful in cases like Rparity violating SUSY where there are no additional handles like leptons, photons or missing energy. Even when\nthere are leptonic decay modes, quark tagging could help\nmeasure the hadronic branching ratio of new physics,\nwhich will be needed to verify the model. Interesting\nstandard model physics also tends to be quark-heavy.\nFor example, vector-boson fusion requires the tagging of\ntwo forward jets which are always quarks, while background jets in this forward region tend to be dominated\nby gluons. Alternatively, there are some scenarios where\nthe new physics is in gluon jets (e.g. coloron models [1],\nwhich produce 4 or more gluon jets), for which gluon\ntagging would also help.\nQuark and gluon jets are an extremely useful abstraction, discussed in hundreds of papers and many experimental studies, despite their not having a precise theoretical or experimental definition [2]. Any flavor tagging\nis only meaningful to the extent that there is a correspondence between hard partons and jets, which is the\nstandard starting point for almost every collider search\ninvolving hadronic final states. The correspondence is affected by things like the jet algorithm, the event's topol-\n\nogy, and the distance between energetic deposits. In this\npaper, quark or gluon jets refer to the parton which is\nproduced in the hard process at leading order in perturbation theory and initiates the parton shower. At this\nlevel there is no ambiguity in what is meant by the jet\nflavor since there is no interference between different final\nstates. In fact, the flavor is well-defined to to all orders\nin perturbation theory up to the same power corrections\nthat affect any collinear and IR safe jet algorithm's parton correspondence [3]. These power corrections involve\nthe jet size R (equivalently the jet's mass-to-energy ratio\nm/E) and \u039bQCD /E.\nIn this paper, we study pure quark or gluon samples\nand only consider observable properties of these jets. The\nexpectation is that properties of jets coming from, say,\nSUSY decays will be more similar to the properties of\nthe quark jets in our simulation, despite the fact that jet\nproperties are not expected to be completely universal \u2013\njet substructure is affected by things like adjacent jets\nand differing color-connections. The result of this paper\nis a rough ranking of jet observables that can be used to\ndistinguish light flavor and help find new physics signals.\nOnce promising observables are found and their distributions measured, it might be possible to construct an even\nmore powerful tagger.\nGluon tagging at the LHC is both more useful and\nachievable than at the Tevatron. The LHC's protonproton initial state, higher energy, and higher luminosity\nincrease the number of jets produced and make gluon jet\nbackgrounds more common. CMS's particle flow [4] and\nAtlas's individually calibrated TopoClusters [5], along\nwith each detector's improved calorimeter resolution, allow unprecedented measurement of the energy and track\ndistribution within jets. As we will see, the better the\nresolution on the jet constituents, the better the tagger\nwill be. We also find that the higher pT jets of the LHC\nare more reliably tagged than lower pT jets of previous\ncolliders, as long as the tracking remains reliable.\nMuch is known experimentally about quark and gluon\njets (see [6] for a summary). One important LEP result\n\n\f2\nwas that b-jets were more similar to gluon jets than to\nlight-quark jets [7, 8]: due to the longer decay chain of\nB-hadrons, the number of particles and angular spread\nis larger for a b-jet than a light-quark jet. The similarity\nof b-jets to gluon jets should be lessened in the LHC's\nhigher pT jets because the QCD shower produces more\nparticles, whereas the particle multiplicity is relatively\nfixed in the B-hadron decay. There are already sophisticated and very detector-specific methods for b-tagging.\nCurrent b-taggers rely mostly on impact parameters or\na secondary vertex, so they are independent of the observables we consider. Therefore, we restrict our study\nto discriminating light quarks (uds) from gluons.\nThe accumulated knowledge from decades of experiments and perturbative QCD calculations have been incorporated into Monte Carlo event generators, in particular Pythia [9] and Herwig [10]. These programs also\ninclude sophisticated hadronization and underlying event\nmodels which have also been tuned to data. Small differences still exist between these tools (and between the\ntools and data), but they provide an excellent starting\npoint to characterize which observables might be useful in\ngluon-tagging. The approach to gluon-tagging discussed\nhere is to find observables which appear promising and\nthen can be measured and calibrated on samples of mixed\nor pure quark or gluon jets at the LHC [3].\nTo understand the structure of a jet, it is important to\ndistinguish observables which average over all events from\nobservables which are useful on an event-by-event basis.\nOne example of an averaged observable is the classic integrated jet shape, \u03a8(r), which has already been measured\nat the LHC [11]. This jet shape is defined as the fraction of a jet's pT within a cone of radius r. Traditionally, jet shapes are presented as an average over all jets\nin a particular pT or \u03b7 range. For any r, the averaged\njet shape becomes a single number, which is generally\nlarger for quarks than for gluons because a greater fraction of a typical quark jet's pT is at the center of the\njet. On traditional jet shape plots, error bars for each r\nare proportional to the standard deviation of the underlying distribution, but that distribution is not a narrow\nGaussian around the average. For example, the event-byevent distributions for \u03a8(r = 0.1) are shown in Figure 1\nfor quarks and gluons. Jet shapes averaged over these\ndistributions throw out useful information about the location and pT 's of particles within the jet, along with\ntheir correlations. For event-by-event discrimination, it\nis crucial to have distributions, whereas most public data\nonly describes averages. In this study we consider \u03a8(r)\nand many other variables to see which are best suited to\nquark/gluon tagging.\nTo generate samples of quark and gluon jets we considered samples of dijet events and \u03b3+jet events. These\nwere generated with madgraph v4.4.26 [12] and showered through both pythia v8.140 [9] and herwig++\n\nFIG. 1: Data on the integrated jet shape \u03a8(r) is usually\npublished only when averaged over all events. Here we show\nthe distribution of \u03a8(0.1), for quarks (blue, solid) and gluons\n(red, hollow). The event-by-event distributions of \u03a8(r) and\nother observables are much more important for gluon tagging\nthan average values.\n\nv2.4.2 [10] with the default tunes. Jets, reconstructed\nusing fastjet v2.4.2 [13], were required to have |\u03b7| < 1.\nWe needed to isolate samples of quark and gluon jets\nwith the similar jet pT 's. Unfortunately, we cannot get\nsimilar jet pT 's by having similar pT 's at the hard parton\nlevel, since the showering changes the pT significantly,\nand differently for quarks and gluons. This is an unphysical difference, since the parton pT is set artificially, and\nwe have to avoid our tagger picking up on it. The solution\nwe chose was to generate and shower a wide spectrum of\ndijet and \u03b3+jet events, and require the resulting Anti-kT\nR=0.5 jets to lie within 10% of the central value for each\nof six pT windows, centered around 50, 100, 200, 400, 800,\nand 1600 GeV. (The underlying hard partons spanned a\nrange from half to twice the central value.) The pT spectrum within each window matches the falling spectrum of\nthe underlying dijet or \u03b3+jet samples, which are nearly\nidentical for quarks and gluons in narrow windows chosen. When the entire event is reclustered with a different\njet size, as was done when examining how the observables\nchange with R, the resulting jet pT no longer necessarily\nlies within the narrow \u00b110% window. In fact, how the\njet pT changes with R forms a quark/gluon discriminant\nsimilar to integrated jet shape.\nWith each sample of similar-pT jets, there are two main\ntypes of observables useful in separating quarks from gluons: discrete ones, which try to distinguish individual\nparticles/tracks/subjets, and continuous ones that can\ntreat the energy or pT within the jet as a smooth function of (\u03b4\u03b7, \u03b4\u03c6) away from the jet axis in order to form\ncombinations like geometric moments.\nThe discrete category includes the number of distinguishable tracks, small subjets, or reconstructed parti-\n\n\f3\ncles. Functions of this information, such as the average\nor the spread (standard deviation) of their pT 's were considered. We find that this class of observables provide the\nbest discrimination at high quark efficiency (mild cuts)\nand high jet pT .\nThe average multiplicity of any type of particle, along\nwith its variance, are sensitive to the QCD charges of\nthe underlying gluon (CA = 3) or quark (CF = 4/3). To\nleading order,\nCA\nhNg i\n=\nhNq i\nCF\n\nand\n\n\u03c3g2\nCA\n.\n=\n\u03c3q2\nCF\n\ntry to capture the 2D shape or color connections of the\njet, like pull [20], eccentricity, or planar flow [21], are less\npowerful in this application.\nWe find the best single observable in the continuous\ncategory is the linear radial moment \u2013 a measure of the\n'width' or 'girth' of the jet \u2013 constructed by adding up\nthe pT deposits within the jet, weighted by distance from\njet axis. It is defined as\nLinear Radial Moment (Girth):\n\n(1)\n\nThe OPAL collaboration, among others, studied the\ncharged particle multiplicity in light-quark and gluon jets\nof energy around 40 GeV to 45 GeV [14] and found distributions that agree well with the Monte Carlo event\ngenerators and with analytic predictions.\nWe find that the strongest discrete observable is the\nnumber of charged particles within the jet, where charged\nparticles were required to have pT > 500 MeV. Lower\ncuttoffs actually lead to better discrimination power, so\nhow well the LHC detectors will be able to resolve particle\npT will have important consequences for gluon tagging.\nAnother discrete observable is the subjet multiplicity,\nwhich was also studied at LEP [15, 16]. Extremely small\nsubjets approach the limit of particles and are sensitive\nto hadronization, but larger subjets probe the better\nmodeled, perturbative physics and give the largest ratio between quark and gluon subjet multiplicities. For\nthe higher-energy jets of the LHC, the optimal jet size\nis far smaller than the calorimeter resolution. We found\nthat counting Rsub =0.1 anti-kT jets was more powerful\nthan other subjet algorithms and larger sizes, but not\nas powerful as counting the number of charged tracks.\nSmall subjet multiplicity can serve as a reasonable substitute if charged track multiplicity proves less reliable in\nsome circumstances (perhaps at very high \u03b7). Counting\nall hadrons works even better than charged tracks.\nOther observables in the discrete category that show\nreasonable discrimination power include the average distance to jet axis hri, the pT fraction of the Nth hardest track or subjet, and the subjet splitting scale (when\nthe jet is reclustered with the kT algorithm). Finally,\nthere are observables that take advantage of the electrical charge that quarks carry. Since the hardest hadrons\nproduced at the end of the shower have charges correlated with the initiating quark, adding up the charges of\nall tracks weighted by their pT gives some small discrimination.\nThe second, more continuous, category of observables\nincludes jet mass, jet broadening [17], and the family of\nradial moments like girth [18], angularities [19], and the\noptimal moment which are described below. These tend\nto perform better at lower jet pT and for achieving high\nquark purity through harsh cuts. Other observables that\n\ng=\n\nX pi\nT\ni\u2208jet\n\npjet\nT\n\n|ri | (2)\n\np\nwhere ri =\n\u2206yi2 + \u2206\u03c62i and where the true boostinvariant rapidity y should be used for the (massive) jet\naxis instead of the geometric pseudorapidity \u03b7. Under the\nassumption of central jets with massless constituents at\nsmall angles, this linear moment is identical to jet broadening, defined as the sum of momenta transverse to the\njet axis normalized by the sum of momenta. While jet\nbroadening is natural at an e+ e\u2212 collider, the linear radial moment is more natural and works a bit better at the\nLHC. Other geometric moments involving different powers of r were not as powerful at discriminating quarks\nfrom gluons, including the jet mass, which is equal to\nthe r2 geometric moment in the same limit.\nBy weighting the pT by other functions of r, whole\nfamilies of radial-kernel observables can be constructed:\nX pi\nT\nK(ri )\n(3)\nKernel Moment :\nK=\njet\np\ni\u2208jet T\nAngularities [19, 21] are one such example, where the pT\nand r are usually replaced by energy and angle. Angularities are often normalized by the jet mass rather than\nthe jet pT , and we considered both normalizations. Both\nangularities and kernels which are powers of r suffer from\nsensitivity to the edge of the jet where their kernels are\ngreatest. This becomes problematic in crowded environments with adjacent jets.\nRather than try to guess a useful kernel, we attempted\nto optimize its shape numerically. By parameterizing the\nkernel as a spline with 5 to 10 points, a genetic algorithm\nwas used to maximize gluon rejection for several different quark efficiencies. In all cases, the optimal kernels\nrose linearly from the axis of the jet out to r \u223c 0.3, then\nturned over and decreased smoothly to zero at the edge\nof the jet, but the gluon rejection in call cases was rather\ninsensitive to the region away from the center. These\noptimal kernels performed slightly better than the linear radial moments, but not enough to justify additional\nfocus here.\nBy looking at combinations of observables, additional\nquark/gluon discrimination is achieved. The 2D histograms for the best discrete and continuous observables,\ncharged particle count and the linear radial moment, are\nshown in Figure 2. While the two observables are correlated, it is still helpful to use both.

Given these variables, the discriminant that\nachieves optimal gluon rejection for a fixed quark efficiency is a simple cut on the appropriate likelihood contour. Cutting out the top-right corner, for example, eliminates the most egregiously gluey jets. In practice, this\ncan be pre-computed or measured in each jet pT window.\nAs part of jet energy scale calibrations, Atlas [22] has\nmeasured these two variables in dijet, \u03b3-jet, and multijet samples and used them individually to determine the\nflavor composition to 10% precision.\nThe same method can be applied for more than 2 observables, but then the exact likelihood becomes impossible to map efficiently with limited training samples. A\nmultivariate technique like Boosted Decision Trees can\nbe employed to approximate this multidimensional likelihood distribution, as explained in [18].\nIn summary, quite a number of single variables do comparably well, while some (like pull or planar flow) do\nquite poorly at gluon tagging. We examined many combinations of observables, and found significant improvement by looking at pairs, but only marginal gains beyond that. The results for the gluon rejection as a function of quark efficiency are shown for a number of the\nmore interesting observables and combinations in Figure 3 for 200 GeV jets. The relative performance of\nvariables changed little with pT even though the optimal cuts do. Definitions and distributions of these\nvariables, and thousands of others, can be found on\nhttp://jets.physics.harvard.edu/qvg. Good pairs\nof variables included one from the discrete category described above, such as particle count, and one more continuous shape variable, like the linear radial moment\n(girth).\nAs an example using these curves to estimate the improvement in a search's reach, consider X \u2192 W W \u2192\nq q\u0304q q\u0304 whose background is mostly 4-jets from QCD, each\nof which is a gluon 80% of the time [3]. By operating at\n60% quark efficiency, only 1/10th of gluons pass the tagger, which means (20%)4 of the total QCD background\n\n102\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nQuark Jet Acceptance\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Gluon rejection curves for several observables as a\nfunction of Quark Jet Acceptance. The results for 200 GeV\nJets are shown, but other samples give similar results. The\nbest pair of observables is charged track multiplicity and linear radial moment (girth). The best group of five also includes\njet mass for the hardest subjet of size R=0.2, the average kT\nof all Rsub =0.1 subjets, and the 3rd such small subjet's pT\nfraction.\n\npasses. One measure\u221a\nof statistical significance in a counting experiment is S/ B, perhaps within a particular invariant mass window. Any starting significance can be\nimproved by a factor of 3.2 using these cuts. The 60%\noperating point was chosen to maximize this significance\nimprovement for this particular background composition,\nwhich highlights the need to characterize background rejection for all signal efficiencies.\nMeasurements of these variables are underway, but it\nwould be very interesting to see distributions of and correlations between as many of the variables in Figure 3\nas possible. To this end, it has recently been observed\nthat 99% pure samples of quark jets can be obtained in\n\u03b3+2jet events, and 95% pure samples of gluon jets can be\n\n\f5\nobtained in 3-jet events [3]. These samples could provide\na direct evaluation of the tagging technique at all jet pT s,\nverify and help improve the Monte Carlo generators, and\nprovide a test of perturbative QCD.\nThe authors would like to thank Gavin Salam for early\nconsultation, the participants of the Boston Jet Physics\nWorkshop for useful feedback, the FAS Research Computing Group at Harvard University and the DOE under\nGrant DE-AC02-76CH03000, for support.\n\n[1] C.
