We propose a new homotopy invariant for Lie groupoids which\ngeneralizes the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category for topological spaces.\nWe use a bicategorical approach to develop a notion of contraction in this context. We propose a notion of homotopy between generalized maps given by\nthe 2-arrows in a certain bicategory of fractions. This notion is invariant under\nMorita equivalence. Thus, when the groupoid defines an orbifold, we have a\nwell defined LS-category for orbifolds. We prove an orbifold version of the\nclassical Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem for critical points.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe LS-category of a topological space is an invariant of the homotopy type of\nthe space introduced in the early 1930's by Lusternik and Schnirelmann [26]. It is a\nnumerical invariant that measures the complexity of the space, in particular if M is\na compact manifold the LS-category of M provides a lower bound for the number\nof critical points of any smooth function on the manifold. The LS-category of a\nspace X is defined as the least number of open subsets, contractible in X, required\nto cover X. For a survey in LS-category see [20, 13].\nThere are many generalizations of the original concept adapted to various contexts such as the fibrewise category, introduced by I.M. James and J.R. Morris\n[21], the equivariant category, by E. Fadell [16] and the transverse and tangential\ncategories for foliated manifolds [12, 11, 8].\nOur aim is to develop a Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory in the context of Lie\ngroupoids. Our main application will be in the setting of orbifolds as groupoids.\nSince an orbifold is defined as a Morita equivalence class of certain type of\ngroupoids [33, 31] our notion of LS-category for Lie groupoids ought to be invariant\nunder Morita equivalence. In this spirit, the right notion of morphism between Lie\ngroupoids is that of a generalized map [33, 31]. We develop a notion of homotopy\nbetween generalized maps. We start with a notion of strong homotopy between\nstrict morphisms which is not Morita invariant, and introduce the notion of essential homotopy equivalence that simultaneously weakens a strict homotopy and\ngeneralizes an essential equivalence. We will say that two Lie groupoids K and G\nhave the same Morita homotopy type if there exists a third groupoid J and essential\nhomotopy equivalences\n\u03b7\n\n\u03bd\n\nK \u2190 J \u2192 G.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 22A22, 55M30, 18D05.\nc XXXX American Mathematical Society\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHELLEN COLMAN\n\nWe prove that the bicategory H of Lie groupoids, strict morphisms and strict homotopies admits a bicalculus of fractions that formally inverts the essential homotopy\nequivalences W . Using the techniques developed in [35] we obtain a new bicategory\nof Lie groupoids H(W \u22121 ) where the essential homotopy equivalences were formally\ninverted. Morita homotopy equivalences introduced above amount to isomorphisms\nin this bicategory.\nOur notion of Morita homotopy corresponds to the 2-arrows in the bicategory\nH(W \u22121 ). This deformation within the groupoid is closely related to the notion of\nG-path developed by Haefliger [17, 19]. We propose a modified version of a G-path\n(between two objects) that we call a multiple G-path (between two orbits). A Morita\nhomotopy determines multiple G-paths between the orbits. A multiple G-path is\n\u01eb\n\u03c3\ndefined as a generalized map I \u2190 I \u2032 \u2192 G where I and I \u2032 are certain groupoids\nassociated to the interval [0, 1]. Multiple G-paths will play a key role in defining\nthe integral curves of a gradient vector field in a Lie groupoid.\nBased on the Morita homotopy notion, we define a G-categorical subgroupoid in\nthe sense of Lusternik and Schnirelmann. A subgroupoid U is G-categorical if it can\nbe deformed by a Morita homotopy into a transitive groupoid. The groupoid LScategory of G, catG, is the minimal number of G-categorical subgroupoids required\nto cover G. When G is the unit groupoid over a manifold M , this number specializes\nto the classical LS-category of the manifold M .\nWe prove that catG is an invariant of the Morita homotopy type. Therefore,\ncatG is invariant under Morita equivalence and yields a well defined invariant for\norbifolds. Let G be an orbifold groupoid defining the orbifold X . The orbifold\nLS-category of X is defined as the groupoid LS-category of G, catX = catG.\nThe orbifold LS-category is a homotopy invariant that detects part of the complexity of the orbifold. It detects the existence of obstructions given by the twisted\nsectors to contract an open set, but somehow misses the \"weight\" of such obstructions.\nWe introduce a variant of the orbifold LS-category that we call the weighted\norbifold LS-category, wcatX . This numerical invariant also generalizes the classical\nLS-category for manifolds, if the orbifold is a manifold X then wcatX = catX. We\nprove that the weighted orbifold category is an invariant of orbifold homotopy type\nwhich relates to the orbifold category of the inertia orbifold.\nFinally we give a version of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem for Lie groupoids.\n\u03c6\n\u01eb\nIf G \u2190 G \u2032 \u2192 R is a generalized map satisfying certain deformation conditions (D)\nthen\nX\ncatG \u2264\ncatKc\nc\u2208R\n\nwhere Kc is the full subgroupoid over the critical points at the level c.\nWe show that if G is an orbifold groupoid defining a compact orbifold, then the\ndeformation conditions (D) are satisfied and we have that the LS-theorem holds for\norbifolds: If X is a compact orbifold and f : X \u2192 R is an orbifold map, then f has\nat least catX critical points.\nWhen counting a finite number of critical points in an orbifold, we face the\ndilemma of how to count. Let K be the critical groupoid. If K is a finite groupoid,\nwe can chose one isolated critical point xi in each orbit and we have that K is\nequivalent to a groupoid whose set of objects is {x1 , * * * , xn } and the set of arrows\nis the disjoint union of the isotropy groups K1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 Kn where the order of Ki is ki\n\n\fTHE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF A LIE GROUPOID\n\n3\n\nand the number of conjugacy classes in Ki is ki\u2032 (then ki = ki\u2032 if Ki is abelian). By\nthe one hand we have that the cardinality of a groupoid of Baez and Dolan [4] and\nthe Euler characteristic of a finite category of Leinster [24] both give as a cardinality\n1\n1\n+ *** +\n. On the other hand the string theoretic\nof K the rational number\nk1\nkn\nEuler characteristic [15] gives as a cardinality of K the integer number k1\u2032 + * * * + kn\u2032 .\nOur weighted orbifold category is a lower bound for this latter cardinality.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the notions of strong and\nMorita equivalence for strict morphisms between Lie groupoids. We describe in this\nsection some examples that will be studied further throughout the paper. Section\n3 is where we develop the notion of strict homotopy associated to a subdivision of\nthe interval I = [0, 1]. We recall the notion of G-path and introduce the multiple\nG-paths. We introduce the notion of essential homotopy equivalence and homotopy\npullback of groupoids. Section 4 is where we show that the bicategory of Lie\ngroupoids, strict morphisms and strict homotopies constructed in section 3 admits\na bicalculus of fractions that inverts the essential homotopy equivalences. We define\nour notion of Morita homotopy as the 2-arrows in this bicategory of fractions. In\nsection 5 we propose a notion of LS-category for Lie groupoids. We say that a\nsubgroupoid is G-categorical, in the sense of Lusternik and Schnirelmann, if there\nis a Morita homotopy between the inclusion and a morphism with image in a single\norbit. We define the LS-category for Lie groupoids and prove that it is invariant\nunder Morita homotopy. In particular, it is invariant under Morita equivalence and\nyields a well defined number for orbifolds. In section 6 we treat in detail this LS\ntheory for orbifolds. We describe the obstructions to deform an open set in terms\nof the orbifold structure of the twisted sectors and give estimates for the orbifold\nLS-category in terms of the categories of the twisted and untwisted sectors. We also\npropose the notion of weighted orbifold LS-category and prove that it is invariant\nunder Morita homotopy equivalence. Section 7 is where we give the preliminaries\nand prove the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem for orbifolds. Given a generalized\n\u03c6\n\u01eb\nmap G \u2190 G \u2032 \u2192 R we introduce a groupoid version of the classical deformation\nconditions. When the groupoid defines an orbifold, we can define the G-flow of\nthe gradient of (\u01eb, \u03c6) and its integral curves will be given by multiple G-paths.\nThese integral G-curves provide the tool to prove that the deformation conditions\nare satisfied for smooth maps on orbifold groupoids. We show that both catG and\nwcatG satisfy some monotonicity, additivity, deformation invariance and continuity\nproperties required to prove the theorem.\nAcknowledgements.

Recall that a groupoid G is a small category in which each\narrow is invertible [28] [7]. Our notation for groupoids is that G0 is the space of\nobjects and G1 is the space of objects, with source and target maps s, t : G1 \u2192 G0 ,\nmultiplication m : G1 \u00d7G0 G1 \u2192 G1 , inversion i : G1 \u2192 G1 , and object inclusion\nu : G0 \u0592\u2192 G1 .\nA Lie groupoid is a groupoid for which G1 and G0 are manifolds, s and t are\nsurjective submersions, and m, i and u are smooth [27].\n\n\f4\n\nHELLEN COLMAN\n\nThe set of arrows from x to y is denoted G(x, y) = {g \u2208 G1 |s(g) = x and t(g) =\ny}. The set of arrows from x to itself, G(x, x), is a group called the isotropy group\nof G at x and denoted by Gx . The orbit of x is the set O(x) = ts\u22121 (x). The orbit\nspace |G| of G is the quotient of G0 under the equivalence relation: x \u223c y iff x and\ny are in the same orbit.\nWe will describe now various Lie groupoids that will appear throughout the\npaper.\n(1) Unit groupoid. Consider the groupoid G associated to a manifold M with\nG0 = G1 = M . This is a Lie groupoid whose arrows are all units, called\nthe unit groupoid and denoted G = u(M ).\n(2) Pair groupoid. Let G with G0 = M as before and consider G1 = M \u00d7 M .\nThis is a Lie groupoid with exactly one arrow from any object x to any\nobject y, called the pair groupoid and denoted G = Pair(M ).\n(3) Point groupoid. Let G be a Lie group. Let \u2022 be a point. Consider the\ngroupoid G with G0 = \u2022 and G1 = G. This is a Lie groupoid with exactly\none object \u2022 and G is the manifold of arrows in which the maps s and t\ncoincide. We denote the point groupoid by \u2022G .\n(4) Translation groupoid. Let K be a Lie group acting (on the left) on a\nmanifold M . Consider the groupoid G with G0 = M and G1 = K \u00d7 M .\nThis is a Lie groupoid with arrows (k, x) from any object x to y = kx,\ncalled the translation or action groupoid and denoted G = K \u22c9 M .\n(5) Holonomy groupoid. Let (M, F ) be a foliated manifold. Consider the\ngroupoid G with G0 = M and whose arrows from x to y on the same\nleaf L \u2208 F are the holonomy classes of paths in L from x to y. There are\nnot arrows between points in different leaves. This is a Lie groupoid called\nthe holonomy groupoid and denoted G = Hol(M, F ).\nWe will denote 1 the trivial groupoid with one object and one arrow, 1 = u(\u2022) =\nPair(\u2022) = \u2022\u2022 .\n2.2. Strong and Morita equivalence. From now on all groupoids will be assumed to be Lie groupoids.\nA morphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 G of groupoids is a functor given by two smooth maps\n\u03c6 : K1 \u2192 G1 and \u03c6 : K0 \u2192 G0 that together commute with all the structure maps\nof the groupoids K and G.\nA natural transformation T between two morphisms \u03c6, \u03c8 : K \u2192 G is a smooth\nmap T : K0 \u2192 G1 with T (x) : \u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c8(x) such that for any arrow h : x \u2192 y in\nK1 , the identity \u03c8(h)T (x) = T (y)\u03c6(h) holds. We write \u03c6 \u223cT \u03c8.\nA morphism \u03c6 : K \u2192 G of groupoids is an equivalence of groupoids if there\nexists a morphism \u03c8 : G \u2192 K of groupoids and natural transformations T and T \u2032\nsuch that \u03c8\u03c6 \u223cT idK and \u03c6\u03c8 \u223cT \u2032 idG . Sometimes we will refer to this notion of\nequivalence as a strong equivalence.\nA morphism \u01eb : K \u2192 G of groupoids is an essential equivalence of groupoids if\n(i) \u01eb is essentially surjective in the sense that\nt\u03c01 : G1 \u00d7G0 K0 \u2192 G0\nis a surjective submersion where G1 \u00d7G0 K0 is the pullback along the source\ns : G1 \u2192 G0 ;\n\n\fTHE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF A LIE GROUPOID\n\n5\n\n(ii) \u01eb is fully faithful in the sense that K1 is given by the following pullback of\nmanifolds:\n\u01eb\n/ G1\nK1\n(s,t)\n\n(s,t)\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\u01eb\u00d7\u01eb\n/ G0 \u00d7 G0\nK0 \u00d7 K0\nThe first condition implies that for any object y \u2208 G0 , there exists an object x \u2208 K0\nwhose image \u01eb(x) can be connected to y by an arrow g \u2208 G1 . The second condition\nimplies that for all x, z \u2208 K0 , \u01eb induces a diffeomorphism K(x, z) \u2248 G(\u01eb(x), \u01eb(z))\nbetween the submanifolds of arrows.\nFor general categories the notions of equivalence and essential equivalence coincide. This applies to the particular case in which the categories are groupoids.\nBut when some extra structure is involved (continuity or differentiability) these two\nnotions are not the same anymore. An essential equivalence implies the existence\nof the inverse functor using the axiom of choice but not the existence of a smooth\nfunctor.\nProposition 2.1. [32] Every equivalence of Lie groupoids is an essential equivalence.\nRemark 2.2. The converse does not hold for Lie groupoids.\nMorita equivalence is the smallest equivalence relation between Lie groupoids\nsuch that they are equivalent whenever there exists an essential equivalence between\nthem.\nDefinition 2.3. Two Lie groupoids K and G are Morita equivalent if there exists\na Lie groupoid J and essential equivalences\n\u01eb\n\n\u03c3\n\nK \u2190 J \u2192 G.\nThis defines an equivalence relation that we denote K \u223cM G.

We will say that \u03c6 is homotopic to \u03c8 if there\nexists a subdivision S and a morphism H S : K \u00d7 IS \u2192 G such that H0S = \u03c6 and\nH1S = \u03c8.\nThis defines a relation of equivalence between morphisms that we will call homotopy equivalence and that sometimes we will refer to it as strong or strict homotopy\nequivalence depending what feature we want to emphasize since we will introduce\na weaker version (in the same sense that an essential equivalence weakens a strong\nequivalence) and a generalized version of this notion (in the same sense that a\nMorita equivalence generalizes an essential equivalence).\nExamples 3.1.\n(1) A natural transformation T : \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 determines an homotopy H S : K \u00d7 IS \u2192 G over the subdivision S = {0 = r0 , r1 = 1/2, r2 = 1}.\nThe homotopy is given by\n(\n\u03c6(x) if r \u2264 1/2 and i = 1,\nS\nH (x, (r, i)) =\n\u03c8(x) if r \u2265 1/2 and i = 2.\non objects;\n(\n\u03c6(k)\nH (k, u(r, i)) =\n\u03c8(k)\nS\n\nif r \u2264 1/2 and i = 1,\nif r \u2265 1/2 and i = 2.\n\non units arrows of IS and H S (k, r1 ) = T (y)\u03c6(k) for the arrow r1 : (1/2, 1) \u2192\n(1/2, 2).\nTherefore, there exist a subdivision S and a morphism H S such that\nS\nH (x, 0) = \u03c6(x), H S (x, 1) = \u03c8(x) and H S (k, 0) = \u03c6(k), H S (k, 1) = \u03c8(k).\n(2) A morphism H : K \u00d7 I \u2192 G, with I being the unit groupoid over the\ninterval I = [0, 1], such that H0 \u223c \u03c6 and H1 \u223c \u03c8 determines a homotopy\nH S : K \u00d7 IS \u2192 G over the subdivision S = {r0 = 0, r1 = 0, r2 = 0, r3 =\n1, r4 = 1, r5 = 1}.

The morphism H : K \u00d7 I \u2192 G defines an equivalence relation\nbut fails to be invariant of Morita equivalence (it is not even invariant of\nstrong equivalence for groupoids).\nProposition 3.2. Let H : U \u00d7 IS \u2192 G be a homotopy of the inclusion, H0 = iU .\nThen, there is an injection j : Gx \u2192 Gyr for all yr = H S (x, (r, i)).\nProof. The homotopy H S restricted to the connected component Ux \u00d7 [0, r1 ] determines an ordinary homotopy, then Gx injects into GH(x,(r,1)) for all r \u2208 [0, r1 ].\nThe isotropy groups GH(x,(r1 ,1)) and GH(x,(r1 ,2)) coincide, since there is an arrow\nr1 from (r1 , 1) to (r1 , 2). Then, we have a finite number of injections:\nGx \u058c GH(x,(r,1)) \u058c GH(x,(r1 ,1)) = GH(x,(r1 ,2)) \u058c GH(x,(r,2)) . . . \u058c GH(x,(rn ,n))\nand Gx injects into GH S (x,(r,i)) for all r \u2208 [ri\u22121 , ri ] with i = 1, . . . , n.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe recall now the definition of G-path, due to Haefliger [18, 17, 19, 6]. For\nanother approach see also [25]. A G-path from x to y over the subdivision S = {0 =\nr0 \u2264 r1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 rn = 1} of the interval [0, 1] is a sequence:\n(\u03b11 , g1 , \u03b12 , g2 , . . . , \u03b1n )\nwhere\n(1) for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n the map \u03b1i : [ri\u22121 , ri ] \u2192 G0 is a path with \u03b11 (0) = x and\n\u03b1n (1) = y\n(2) for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 the arrow gi \u2208 G1 satisfies:\ns(gi ) = \u03b1i (ri )\nt(gi ) = \u03b1i+1 (ri )\n\u03b11\n\nx \u2022 /o /o /o o/ /\u2022\n\ng1\n\n/\n\n\u2022\n\n***\n\n\u03b1n\n\n\u2022 /o /o /o o/ /\u2022 y\n\nOur notion of homotopy H S : K \u00d7 IS \u2192 G between H0S = \u03c6 and H1S = \u03c8\ndetermines for each x \u2208 K0 a G-path over the subdivision S between the objects\n\u03c6(x) and \u03c8(x) in G0 . In fact, it determines many more paths in G1 other than\nthe one defined by the unit arrows. If we think of a G-path as a morphism from\nsome version of the interval I to G, we have that the Haefliger G-paths correspond\nto morphisms \u03c3 : IS \u2192 G, where the groupoid IS is the one constructed above.\nRemark 3.3. A homotopy H S : K \u00d7 IS \u2192 G determines a G-path H1Sx : IS \u2192 G\nwhere 1x is the trivial groupoid over x \u2208 K0 .\nNote that thinking of a G-path as a morphism \u03c3 from IS to G, the image of the\narrows in IS by \u03c3 is almost entirely contained in u(G0 ) since most of the arrows\nin IS are units, with the only exception of the arrows {r1 , * * * , rn\u22121 } and their\ninverses. In other words, we can not fill the space G1 with paths of arrows given by\nthe G-paths. This is going to be a very relevant problem when we try to integrate a\nvector field. Motivated by these considerations, we propose the notion of multiple\nG-path.\nTo define the several branches coming into a multiple G-path we need to introduce\nseveral copies of each subinterval in the subdivision S.

In this spirit, we will say that the initial subgroupoid\nof the path is \u03c3(0\u2032 ) and the end subgroupoid is \u03c3(1\u2032 ).

The functor h is a homotopy equivalence with homotopic\ninverse the constant map and \u01eb is an essential equivalence. We have that \u03b7 = \u01ebh\nis an essential homotopy equivalence. Note that in this case \u03b7 is neither a (strong)\nhomotopy equivalence nor an essential equivalence.\nIt is clear that essential equivalences as well as (strong) homotopy equivalences\nare essential homotopy equivalences.\nProposition 3.10.\n(1) An essential equivalence is an essential homotopy equivalence.\n(2) A homotopy equivalence is an essential homotopy equivalence.\nProposition 3.11.

Recall that a bicategory B consists of a class of\nobjects, morphisms between objects and 2-morphisms between morphisms together\nwith various ways of composing them. A 2-morphism is a 2-equivalence if it is\ninvertible in B whereas a morphism is an equivalence if it is invertible up to a\n\u223c\n2-equivalence in B. We have that H : \u03c6 \u21d2 \u03c8 is a 2-equivalence in B if there exists\n\u223c\nG such that HG = id and GH = id, and \u03c6 : K \u2192 G is an equivalence in B if there\n\u223c\n\u223c\nexists \u03c8 such that \u03c6\u03c8 \u21d2 id and \u03c8\u03c6 \u21d2 id.\nWe can compose 2-morphisms in two ways called horizontal and vertical composition.Vertical composition is strictly associative whereas horizontal composition is\nonly associative up to 2-equivalence (associator). The unit laws for morphisms hold\nup to 2-equivalences (left and right unit constrains). Associator and unit constrains\nare required to be natural with respect to their arguments and verify certain axioms\n[5].\nGiven a bicategory B and a subset A \u2282 B1 of morphisms satisfying certain\nconditions, there exists a bicategory B(A\u22121 ) having the same objects as B but\ninverse morphisms of morphisms in A have been added as well as more 2-morphisms.\nThis new bicategory is called a bicategory of fractions of B with respect to A and was\nconstructed by Pronk in [35]. The bicategory of fractions B(A\u22121 ) is characterized\nby the universal property that any morphism F : B \u2192 D sending elements of A\ninto equivalences factors in a unique way as F = F\u0303 \u25e6 U\nU\n\n/ B(A\u22121 )\nw\nww\nF www\n\u000f {www F\u0303\nD\n\nB\n\nThe following conditions are needed on A to admit a bicalculus of right fractions\n[35]:\nBF1 All equivalences are in A.\nBF2 If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are in A, then \u03c6\u03c8 \u2208 A.\nBF3 For all \u03b7 : J \u2192 G and \u03c6 : K \u2192 G with \u03b7 \u2208 A there exists an object P and\nmorphisms \u03bd : P \u2192 K and \u03c8 : P \u2192 J with \u03bd \u2208 A such that the following\nsquare commutes up to a 2-equivalence:\nP\n\n\u03c8\n\n/J\n\u03b7\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u000f\nK\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u000f\n/G\n\nBF4 If H : \u03b7\u03c6 \u21d2 \u03b7\u03c6 is a 2-morphism with \u03b7 \u2208 A then there exists a morphism\n\u03bd \u2208 A and a 2-morphism F : \u03c6\u03bd \u21d2 \u03c6\u03bd such that H * \u03bd = \u03b7 * F .\n\u223c\nBF5 If there is a 2-equivalence \u03b7 \u21d2 \u03bd with \u03bd \u2208 A then \u03b7 \u2208 A.\nProposition 4.1.

[32] A Lie groupoid G is Morita equivalent to a point groupoid\nif and only if G is transitive.\nSince an orbit groupoid is transitive, for U to be G-categorical we can substitute\nthe constant generalized map in definition 5.1 by a generalized map with image\ncontained in a point groupoid.\nDefinition 5.4. The LS category, catG, of a Lie groupoid G is the least number of\nG-categorical subgroupoids required to cover G. If G cannot be covered by a finite\nnumber of G-categorical subgroupoids, set catG = \u221e.\nThis number is an invariant of Morita equivalence that generalizes the ordinary\nLS category of a manifold. If G = u(M ) is the unit groupoid, then catG = catM ,\nwhere cat in the second term means the ordinary LS category.\nWith these definitions we choose the point groupoids as our contractible groupoids.\nWe make this choice in spite of the fact that the fundamental group of the point\ngroupoid is not necessary trivial since \u03c01 (\u2022K ) = K if K is discrete. Our choice is\ninspired by the A-category of Clapp and Puppe [14] and justified by the equivariant LS theory for group actions. The point groupoid can be seen as the translation\ngroupoid of the (ineffective) action of K on a point \u2022. Since the equivariant LS\ncategory of a K-manifold, catK M , coincides with the ordinary category catM when\nthe action is trivial, we have that the equivariant category catK \u2022 = cat\u2022 = 1. In our\ntheory, a G-categorical groupoid factors through a point groupoid. For all groups\nK we have:\ncat\u2022K = catK \u2022 = cat\u2022 = 1\nwhere the first term is the groupoid category of the point groupoid, the second is\nthe equivariant category of the action of K on a point, and the third, the ordinary\ncategory of a point.\nIn section 6.2 we will give a weighted version of the LS groupoid category that\ntakes into account the fact that point groupoids are not contractible in the sense\nmentioned above.\n5.2. Invariance of Morita homotopy type. We will show that the LS category\nof a groupoid is an invariant of Morita homotopy type, and then, invariant under\nMorita equivalence.\nProposition 5.5.

We have that Gx \u058c K.\nIn particular, if the isotropy groups are finite, we have that |Gx | divides |K| for all\nx \u2208 U . For instance, a categorical subgroupoid U cannot factor through a trivial\ngroup K except in case that all the points in U have trivial isotropy.\nExample 5.8. Let G = Hol(K, FS ) be the holonomy groupoid of the Seifert fibration FS on the Klein bottle K. We can cover K by two M\u00f6bius bands M as\nbefore. Since the isotropy at the points in the center fiber is Z2 these points cannot be moved by a homotopy to a point in the neighborhood with trivial isotropy.\nTherefore this covering is minimal and the groupoid category is catHol(K, FS ) = 2.\n6. Orbifolds as groupoids\nWe recall now the description of orbifolds as groupoids due to Moerdijk and\nPronk [33, 31]. Orbifolds were first introduced by Satake [36] as a generalization of\na manifold defined in terms of local quotients. The groupoid approach provides a\nglobal language to reformulate the notion of orbifold.\nWe follow the exposition in [31] and [1]. A groupoid G is proper if (s, t) : G1 \u2192\nG0 \u00d7 G0 is a proper map and it is a foliation groupoid if each isotropy group is\ndiscrete.\nDefinition 6.1. An orbifold groupoid is a proper foliation groupoid.\n\n\f28\n\nHELLEN COLMAN\n\nFor instance the holonomy group of a foliation F is always a foliation groupoid\nbut it is an orbifold groupoid if and only if F is a compact-Hausdorff foliation.\nGiven an orbifold groupoid G, its orbit space |G| is a locally compact Hausdorff\nspace. Given an arbitrary locally compact Hausdorff space X we can equip it with\nan orbifold structure as follows:\nDefinition 6.2. An orbifold structure on a locally compact Hausdorff space X is\ngiven by an orbifold groupoid G and a homeomorphism h : |G| \u2192 X.\nIf \u01eb : H \u2192 G is an essential equivalence and |\u01eb| : |H| \u2192 |G| is the induced\nhomeomorphism between orbit spaces, we say that the composition h\u25e6|\u01eb| : |H| \u2192 X\ndefines an equivalent orbifold structure.\nDefinition 6.3. An orbifold X is a space X equipped with an equivalence class\nof orbifold structures. A specific such structure, given by G and h : |G| \u2192 X is a\npresentation of the orbifold X .\nIf two groupoids are Morita equivalent, then they define the same orbifold.\nTherefore any structure or invariant for orbifolds, if defined through groupoids,\nshould be invariant under Morita equivalence.\nDefinition 6.4. An orbifold map f : Y \u2192 X is given by an equivalence class of\ngeneralized maps (\u01eb, \u03c6) from K to G between presentations of the orbifolds such\nthat the diagram commutes:\n|K|\n\n|\u03c6||\u01eb|\u22121\n\n/ |G|\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/X\nY\nA specific such generalized map (\u01eb, \u03c6) is called a presentation of the orbifold map\nf.\nOur notion of Morita homotopy gives a notion of homotopy for orbifolds:\nDefinition 6.5. An orbifold homotopy between the orbifold maps f, g : Y \u2192 X is\ngiven by a Morita homotopy between the presentations (\u01eb, \u03c6) of f and (\u03b4, \u03c8) of g.\nIn other words, an orbifold homotopy is given by the following diagram\n\u2032\n\nKO A\nAA \u03c6\n}}\nAA\n}\n}\nu\nAA\n}\n}\n}\n}~\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f A\nK `A \u0013 H L H \u2032 \u0013 > G\n}\nAA\nAA\n}}\nv }}\n}\n\u03bd AAA\n\u000f }} \u03c8\nK\u2032\u2032\n\u03b7\n\nwhere K to G are presentations of the orbifolds Y and X .\nRemark 6.6. Since the groupoid L has the same Morita homotopy type as K, we can\nalways take a presentation of the orbifold homotopy Y \u00d7 I \u2192 X given by a strict\nhomotopy H S : L \u00d7 IS \u2192 G, where L and K define the same orbifold homotopy\nclass of orbifolds.\n\n\fTHE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF A LIE GROUPOID\n\n29\n\nExample 6.7. Consider the orbifold X having as a presentation groupoid the\nholonomy groupoid associated to the Seifert fibration on the M\u00f6bius band, G =\nHol(M, FS ), its underlying space is X = [0, 1). The orbifold X has the same orbifold\nhomotopy type as the orbifold Y represented by the point groupoid K = \u2022Z2 . The\nMorita homotopy equivalence is given by an orbifold map Y \u2192 X with presentation:\n\u03b7\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2022Z2 \u2190 Z2 \u22c9 I \u2192 Hol(M, FS )\nas in example 4.5. The homotopic inverse X \u2192 Y is given by the generalized map\n\u03b7\n\u03bd\nHol(M, FS ) \u2190 Z2 \u22c9 I \u2192 \u2022Z2 .\n6.1. LS category for orbifolds. If G is a presentation for the orbifold X , we\ndefine the LS category of X as the groupoid category of G, catX = catG.\nBy proposition 5.5 the LS category of a groupoid is invariant under Morita\nequivalence, then this definition is independent of the chosen presentation for X .\nThe LS category of an orbifold X is an invariant of the orbifold homotopy type\nwhich generalizes the classical LS category in case that the orbifold is a manifold.\nIf the orbifold is effective the LS category for orbifolds as groupoids coincide with\nthe LS category for orbifolds as defined by the author in [9] using local charts.\nRemark 6.8. Since a transitive groupoid is Morita equivalent to a point groupoid,\nwe have that catX = 1 if the underlying topological space X = |G| of the orbifold\nX is a point.\nFor instance, we have that in example 6.7 the orbifold category of X is catX = 1\nsince the presentation G = Hol(M, FS ) has the same Morita homotopy type of a\npoint groupoid. In this case, the ordinary category of the underlying topological\nspace X = [0, 1), coincides with the orbifold category of X , though in general, it is\njust a lower bound:\nProposition 6.9. Let X be an orbifold and X its underlying topological space.\nThen catX \u2265 catX.\nProof. Let G be a presentation groupoid for the orbifold X , then |G| is homeomorphic to X. We will show that catG \u2265 cat|G|. Let U \u2282 G0 be an invariant open set\nsuch that U is G-categorical. Since s and t are open maps, we have that \u03c0 : G \u2192 |G|\nis an open map too. Therefore, \u03c0(U ) is an open set in |G|. The S-homotopy between\nthe inclusion and the constant map induces a homotopy H : \u03c0(U ) \u00d7 |IS | \u2192 |G| in\nthe orbit spaces. Since IS is Morita equivalent to the interval I regarded as a unit\ngroupoid, we have that |IS | = I. Thus \u03c0(U ) is categorical for |G| = X, in the\nordinary sense.\n\u0003\nExample 6.10. The groupoids G and K in example 2.4 define the teardrop orbifold\nX . For the groupoid G, we have a G-categorical covering given by U = D1 and\nV = D2 and for K we can consider the K-categorical covering given by U = S 3 \u2212TN\nand V = S 3 \u2212 TS where TS and TN are the cores of the solid tori. We have that\ncatX = 2.\nWe recall now the notion of inertia groupoid [31] and its decomposition in twisted\nand untwisted sectors. We show that the orbifold category of the twisted sectors\nprovides a lower bound for the orbifold category of the orbifold.\nLet G be an orbifold groupoid. The inertia groupoid \u2227G is a Lie groupoid whose\nmanifold of objects is given by\n(\u2227G)0 = SG = {g \u2208 G1 |s(g) = t(g)}.\n\n\f30\n\nHELLEN COLMAN\n\nFigure 5.\nWe can think of the elements in SG as loops in G. The manifold of arrows\n(\u2227G)1 = SG \u00d7sG0 G1\nis given by the following pullback of manifolds:\nSG \u00d7sG0 G1\n\n/ SG\n\n\u000f\nG1\n\n\u000f\n/ G0\n\n\u03b2\ns\n\nwhere \u03b2 sends a loop g : x \u2192 x to its source (or target) \u03b2(g) = x.

In the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory for topological spaces, we count the amount of categorical sets required to cover the space.\nThere are no distinctions between the categorical sets since all of them factor\nthrough a point. In the groupoid context, we count subgroupoids which factor\nthrough point groupoids. We are going to distinguish our point groupoids by their\nweights and count categorical subgroupoids together with the weights of their associated point groupoids. This idea is inspired by the work of Tom Leinster on\nthe Euler characteristic of a finite category [24] and based on the string-theoretic\norbifold Euler characteristic [15, 3, 2].\nLet G be an orbifold groupoid and U be a G-categorical subgroupoid. Let K be\na group of minimal order such that U factors through \u2022K . We define the weight of\nU as the number k of conjugacy classes in K, w(U) = k. If K is abelian, then the\nweight of U is the order of K, w(U) = |K|.\nA covering {U1 , . . . , Un } of G is minimal if Ui is G-categorical and catG = n.\nGiven a minimal covering {U1 , . . . , Un } and its associated set of weights {w1 , . . . , wn }\nwe propose the following\nDefinition 6.13. The weighted LS category, wcatG, of a Lie groupoid G is the least\nvalue of the sum:\nn\nX\nwi\ni=1\n\nfor all {U1 , . . . , Un } minimal coverings.\n\nExample 6.14.\n(1) Consider the translation groupoid G = S 1 \u22c9 S 3 defining\nthe teardrop orbifold X as in example 2.4. For the categorical covering\n{U, V} by subgroupoids of G given by U = S 3 \u2212 TN and V = S 3 \u2212 TS we\nhave that the associated set of weights is {1, 3}. This covering is minimal\nand gives the least sum, then wcatG = 4.\n(2) For the translation groupoid G = D8 \u22c9 S 2 , consider the categorical covering\n{U, V} by subgroupoids of G given by U = S 2 \u2212 N and V = S 2 \u2212 S as in\nexample 6.11 (2). Both subgroupoids U and V factor through the group D8 .\nThe conjugation classes in D8 are given by {{1}, {\u03c1, \u03c13}, {\u03c12 }, {\u03c3, \u03c12 \u03c3}, {\u03c1\u03c3, \u03c13 \u03c3}},\nthen the class number is 5. Therefore, a the set of weights associated to\nthis covering is {5, 5}. We have that wcatG = 10.\nWe will show that the weighted category of an orbifold groupoid is an invariant\nof Morita homotopy type, then in particular yields a well defined invariant for\norbifolds: wcatX = wcatG for any groupoid presentation G. Moreover, the weighted\ncategory for orbifolds is an invariant of orbifold homotopy type.\nProposition 6.15. If K and G are orbifold groupoids with K \u2243 G, then wcatK =\nwcatG.\nProof. Let wcatK = m and let {U1 , . . . , Un } be a minimal K-covering realizing\nthe least sum, then m = w1 + . . . + wn where {w1 , . . . , wn } is the set of weights\nassociated to {U1 , . . . , Un }. We construct a G-minimal covering {V1 , . . . , Vn } as in\nthe proof of Proposition 5.5. By Lemma 5.7 we have that {w1 , . . . , wn } is also a\nset of weights for {V1 , . . . , Vn } and it is minimal with this property. Then wcatG =\nw1 + . . . + wn = m.\n\u0003\nWe conjecture that the weighted category of an orbifold groupoid coincides with\nthe (unweighted) category of its inertia groupoid, wcatG = cat \u2227 G.\n\n\fTHE LUSTERNIK-SCHNIRELMANN CATEGORY OF A LIE GROUPOID\n\n33\n\n7. Critical points\nClassically, the LS category of a manifold is a lower bound for the number\nof critical points of a smooth function under certain conditions. We propose a\ngeneralization of the notion of critical point for generalized maps and prove that\nthe LS theorem holds for orbifold groupoids.\nLet \u03c6 : L \u2192 G be a morphism of Lie groupoids. A point x \u2208 L0 is a critical point\nfor \u03c6 if x is critical for the object part of the functor, (d\u03c60 )x = 0.\nProposition 7.1. If x \u2208 L0 is a critical point for \u03c6, then:\n(1) for all y \u2208 O(x), y is a critical point for \u03c6 and\n(2) for all g \u2208 L1 with s(g) = x, g is a critical point (arrow) for \u03c61\nProof. Let g \u2208 L1 be an arrow g : x \u2192 y. From the following diagram\n\u03c61\n\nL1\ns\n\ns\n\nt\n\n\u000f \u000f\nL0\n\n/ G1\n\n\u03c60\n\nt\n\n\u000f \u000f\n/ G0\n\nwe have that d(s\u03c61 )g = d(\u03c60 s)g . Then\n(ds)\u03c61 (g) \u25e6 (d\u03c61 )g = (d\u03c60 )s(g) \u25e6 (ds)g = 0\nsince x = s(g) is critical for \u03c60 . Since s is a submersion, we have that (ds)\u03c61 (g) has\nmaximal rank and then (d\u03c61 )g = 0. Thus, g is critical for \u03c61 . Moreover, this implies\nthat (dt)\u03c61 (g) \u25e6 (d\u03c61 )g = 0. Since d(t\u03c61 )g = d(\u03c60 t)g , then (d\u03c60 )t(g) \u25e6 (dt)g = 0. We\nhave that (d\u03c60 )t(g) = 0 since t has maximal rank. Then y = t(g) is critical for\n\u03c60 .\n\u0003\nTherefore, if x is a critical point for \u03c6, we will write (d\u03c6)OK = 0 where O is the\norbit of x and K the isotropy group at x.\nDefinition 7.2. Let \u03c6 : L \u2192 G be a morphism of Lie groupoids. An orbit groupoid\nOK \u2282 L is a critical subgroupoid if (d\u03c6)OK = 0.\nProposition 7.3. Let \u03c6, \u03c8 : L \u2192 G be two equivalent morphisms, \u03c6 \u223cT \u03c8. The\norbit groupoid OK is a critical subgroupoid for \u03c6 if and only if OK is a critical\nsubgroupoid for \u03c8.\nProof. If T : L0 \u2192 G1 is a natural transformation between \u03c6 and \u03c8, the following\ndiagrams are commutative\nG1\n|>\n|\nT ||\n|| s\n|\n\u000f\n| \u03c60\n/ G0\nL0\n\nG1\n|>\n|\nT ||\n|| t\n|\n| \u03c80\n\u000f\n/ G0\nL0\n\nand we have that d(sT )x = d\u03c6x and d(tT )x = d\u03c8x . If x is critical for \u03c6, then\ndsT (x) \u25e6 dTx = 0 and since s has maximal rank, dTx = 0. Then d\u03c8x = dtT (x) \u25e6 dTx =\n0 and x is critical for \u03c8.\n\u0003\nProposition 7.4. If \u01eb : L \u2192 K is an essential equivalence, then \u01eb has no critical\nsubgroupoids.\n\n\f34\n\nHELLEN COLMAN\n\nProof. An essential equivalence \u01eb is equivalent by a natural transformation to \u01eb\u2032\nwith \u01eb\u20320 being a submersion.\n\u0003\nDefinition 7.5.

Let (\u01eb, \u03c6) and (\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) be two equivalent generalized maps. The\norbit subgroupoid OK \u2282 J is critical for (\u01eb, \u03c6) if and only if it is critical for (\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ).\nProof.

Since OK \u2282 J\n\u2032\nis critical for (\u01eb, \u03c6), we have that there exists a subgroupoid O\u2032K \u2282 L for \u03c6 with\n\u2032\n\u01eb(O\u2032K ) \u2282 OK and d\u03c6O\u2032 K \u2032 = 0.\n\u2032\nConsider the subgroupoid S = p3 (O\u2032K \u00d7L A) given by the following fibered\nproduct of groupoids:\n\u2032\n\nO\u2032K \u00d7L A\n\np1\n\n/ O\u2032K \u2032\niO\u2032K \u2032\n\np3\n\n\u000f\nA\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n/L\n\nThen (d\u03c6)\u03b1(S) \u25e6 d\u03b1S = (d\u03c6\u2032 )\u03b2(S) \u25e6 d\u03b2S = 0 and (d\u03c6\u2032 )\u03b2(S) = 0 since \u03b2 has maximal\n\u2032\u2032\nrank. Taking O\u2032\u2032K = \u03b2(S) \u2282 L\u2032 we have that OK is critical for (\u01eb\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ).\n\u0003\nThen the notion of critical subgroupoid is well defined for the class of equivalence\nof the generalized map defining the orbifold morphism.\n7.1.

We will say that the\nsubgroupoid U is a neighborhood of W.\n\nIn particular, every orbit subgroupoid in an orbifold groupoid has a G-categorical\nneighborhood. Note that this property does not hold for general Lie groupoids.\nRemark 7.10. If G is an orbifold groupoid defining the orbifold X , then for each\nx \u2208 G0 there exist arbitrary small neighborhoods U of x for which U is isomorphic\nto the action groupoid Gx \u22c9 U [33].

This distance\ndefines a metric which is complete if the orbifold is compact.\nLet X be a G-vector field on G. We will say that \u03c3 is an integral G-curve for X if\n\u03c3\u0307 = X \u25e6 \u03c3. If 0 is in J, we call \u03c3(0) the initial subgroupoid of the integral G-curve.\nFor a compact orbifold groupoid, we have that for each orbit subgroupoid OK\nthere is a maximal integral G-curve \u03c3OK for X whose domain is given by J =\n(\u2212\u221e, +\u221e) and the initial subgroupoid is OK .\nDefinition 7.16. The flow of X is the morphism \u03c6 : G \u00d7 R\u2032S \u2192 G given by\n\u03c6(x, (r, i, j)) = \u03c3OK ((r, i, j)) with x \u2208 O on objects and \u03c6(g, ri ) = \u03c3OK (ri ) with\ng \u2208 K on arrows.\n\nWe have that \u03c6(x, (r\u2032 + r, i + i\u2032 , j)) = \u03c6(\u03c6(x, (r, i, j)), (r\u2032 , i\u2032 , j))) on objects and\nsimilarly on arrows.\nGiven a morphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 R where G is an orbifold groupoid defining a compact\norbifold, consider the G-vector field X = \u2207\u03c6 given by the gradient \u2207\u03c6 : G \u2192 T G.\nThen the flow of the G-vector field X = \u2207\u03c6 gives the Morita homotopy required\nby the G-deformation conditions. Then an orbifold groupoid G defining a compact\norbifold X is in the hypothesis of corollary 7.12 and the statement of the theorem\nfollows.\nReferences\n[1] A. Adem, J. Leida and Y. Ruan, Y.
