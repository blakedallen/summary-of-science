Techniques from representation theory, symbolic computational algebra, and numerical algebraic geometry are used to\nfind the minimal generators of the ideal of the trifocal variety. An\neffective test for determining whether a given tensor is a trifocal\ntensor is also given.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the field of multiview geometry one studies n \u2265 2 planar images\nof points in space. Given n full rank 3 \u00d7 4 matrices A1 , . . . , An over C,\nthese camera matrices determine a rational map\n\u03c6 : P3 99K (P2 )n\n\nx 7\u2192 (A1 x, * * * , An x)\n\nfrom projective 3-space into the n-fold product of projective planes. For\nany given tuple (A1 , . . . , An ) the image of this map determines a variety\n\u03c6(P3 ) \u2286 (P2 )n called the multiview variety associated to (A1 , . . . , An ).\nIn [AST11] the authors determine the prime ideal defining the multiview variety for a generic fixed tuple of cameras such that the camera\nmatrices A1 , . . . , An have pairwise distinct kernels. In this paper we\nfocus on a different, but related variety in the special case of n = 3\ncameras: the variety of all trifocal tensors [HZ03, Ch. 15]. The essential difference is that for the multiview variety the camera matrices are\nfixed and this determines a map from the world to a set of images, but\nin the trifocal setup we consider the set of tensors determined by all\npossible general configurations of triples of cameras. Algebraically, the\ncollection of trifocal tensors is parameterized by the 4 \u00d7 4 minors of\nthe 4 \u00d7 9 matrix (AT1 | AT2 | AT3 ) which involve one column each from\nthe first two blocks, and two columns from the third block [Hey00].\nGeometrically, a trifocal tensor arises from a bilinear map describing\nthe geometry of a given configuration of cameras. We give a complete\ndescription of the ideal describing this subvariety of tensors.\nWe further describe this geometric map. Each camera matrix Ai\ndetermines a focal point fi \u2208 P3 and a viewing plane \u03c0i ' P2 \u2286 P3 .\nDate: July 30, 2018.\n1\n\n\fCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.

Now consider lines li \u2286 \u03c0i for i = 1, 2.\nThe planes hf1 , l1 i and hf2 , l2 i generically intersect in a line l1,2 \u2286 P3 ,\nand the plane hf3 , l1,2 i generically intersects \u03c03 in a line l3 . See Figure 1.\nWe have described for a sufficiently general camera configuration, a\nmap\nP2 \u00d7 P2 \u2192 P2 ,\ngiven by (l1 , l2 ) 7\u2192 l3 . This map must come from a bilinear map\nC3 \u00d7 C3 \u2192 C3 .\nTo help avoid ambiguity, fix A, B, C ' C3 so that this map is now\nA\u00d7B \u2192 C. This bilinear map is equivalently a tensor T \u2208 A\u2217 \u2297B \u2217 \u2297C,\ncalled a trifocal tensor because of its derivation. For more details, see\n[HZ03, Chapter 15],[AT10], [Hey00], [PF98].\nOne way to connect these two seemingly different algebraic and geometric constructions is via the following construction, which shows (in\nan invariant way) how the parametrization using special minors of a\n4 \u00d7 9 matrix gives rise to a tensor parametrization. This also relates\nto the compactified camera space considered\nin [AST11].\n\u0001\nThe row space of AT1 | AT2 | AT3 determines a point in the Grassmannian Gr(4, 9). Set U1 , U2 , U3 respectively as the\u0001 3-dimensional column spaces of the blocked matrix AT1 | AT2 | AT3 . The direct sum\nW = U1 \u2295 U2 \u2295 U3 is 9-dimensional, and we can view the matrix\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n3\n\n\u0001\nAT1 | AT2 | AT3 as describing a point in the Grassmannian\nV\nGr(4, W ) \u2282 P( 4 W ).\nConsider the group G = SL(U1 ) \u00d7 SL(U2 ) \u00d7 SL(U3 ) \u2282 SL(W ), which\ncan be thought of as the group of (unit\nV determinant) 3 \u00d7 3 blocks on\nthe diagonal of a 9 \u00d7 9 matrix. Now 4 W decomposes as a G-module\nas follows\n!\n!\nM\nM V2\nV4\nV3\nV2\n(U1 \u2295 U2 \u2295 U3 ) =\nUi \u2297 Uj \u2295\nUi \u2297 Uj\ni6=j\n\ni6=j\n\n!\nM\n\n\u2295\n\nUi \u2297 Uj \u2297\n\nV2\n\nUk\n\n.\n\ni,j,k distinct\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nIf we take V\nA = U1 , B = U2 and C = U3 , we see that the factor\nU1 \u2297 U2 \u2297 2 U3 is isomorphic to A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C and corresponds to the\nspace of maximal minors of a 4 \u00d7 9 matrix using 1 column from the\nfirst two 4 \u00d7 3 blocks and 2 columns from the last 4 \u00d7 3 block. So we\nget a G-equivariant projection\nV \u0001\n\u03c0 : Gr(4, 9) 99K P U1 \u2297 U2 \u2297 2 U3 \u223c\n= P(A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C),\nand the closure of the image of this projection is the trifocal variety X.\nBecause the projection is G-equivariant, the image X is automatically\nG-invariant. The generic fiber of the projection \u03c0 is 3 dimensional.\nHowever, there is a (C\u2217 )3 action by scaling each Ai that leaves the\nset of trifocal tensors invariant. The GIT quotient Gr(4, 9)//(C\u2217 )3 has\ndimension 18, which is the dimension of X, [AST11, AT10]. So if one\nworks with the GIT quotient, the map\nV \u0001\n\u03c0 : Gr(4, 9)//(C\u2217 )3 99K P U1 \u2297 U2 \u2297 2 U3 ,\nbecomes birational to X.\nOne would like to know when a given tensor in V = A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C\narose as a trifocal tensor. The Zariski closure of the set of all such trifocal tensors defines an irreducible algebraic variety, called the trifocal\nvariety and hereafter denoted by X \u2282 PV . Let I(X) denote the ideal\nof polynomial functions vanishing on X, hereafter called the trifocal\nideal. Since a tensor T is a trifocal tensor (or a limit of such) if and\nonly if T is a zero of every polynomial in the ideal I(X), the question of\nidentifying trifocal tensors can be answered (at least for general tensors\nin an open set of X) by determining the minimal generators of I(X).\nIn [AT10] the authors determine a set of polynomials that cut out X\nas a set. However, their set of polynomials does not generate the ideal\nI(X). We note that [PF98] and [Res03] also found some equations\n\n\f4\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nvanishing on X, but neither described the entire trifocal ideal. The\nfocus of this article is to determine the minimal generators of I(X).\nChoosing bases {a1 , a2 , a3 }, {b1 , b2 , b3 }, and {c1 , c2 , c3 } of A\u2217 , B \u2217 and\nC respectively, any tensor T \u2208 V can be realized as\nT =\n\n3\nX\n\nTi,j,k ai \u2297 bj \u2297 ck\n\ni,j,k=1\n\nvia the 27 variables Ti,j,k for 1 \u2264 i, j, k \u2264 3 Therefore, the trifocal ideal\nlives in the polynomial ring k[Tijk ].\nThe cubic polynomials in the ideal are the 10 coefficients of\ndet(x1 Tij1 + x2 Tij2 + x3 Tij3 ).\nOne component of the zero set of these polynomials is our variety. To\nremove the other components we add polynomials of degree 5 and 6.\nTo simplify matters, we will take the ground field to be k = C;\nhowever, we note that in practice, one works over R. A tensor with\nreal entries is on the complex trifocal variety if and only if it is a zero of\nall polynomials in I(X). And indeed, all of the generating polynomials\nin I(X) can be taken with rational coefficients, and thus are in the\nideal of X when considered as a variety over R.\nOur result is the following.\nTheorem 1.1. Let X denote the trifocal variety. The prime ideal I(X)\nis minimally generated by 10 polynomials in degree 3, 81 polynomials\nin degree 5, and 1980 polynomials in degree 6.\nThere are noticeably more generators here than in [AT10], which\nshowed that 10 equations of degree 3, 20 of degree 9, and 6 of degree\n12 cut out X set-theoretically. On the other hand, the degrees of our\nequations are lower and we know that they are the minimal degree\npolynomials that generate the ideal.\n2. Outline\nTo prove Theorem 1.1 and determine the minimal generators of the\ntrifocal ideal, we use a mixture of several different computational and\ntheoretical tools that we now outline. In short, our strategy is to first\nfind equations in the ideal in the lowest degrees, next show that the\nequations we found cut out the variety set theoretically and thus define\nan ideal that agrees up to radical with the ideal we want, and then we\nshow that the two ideals are actually equal.\nBecause the trifocal construction is unchanged by changes of coordinates in each camera plane, we have a large group G that acts on X.\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n5\n\nWe describe this symmetry and various representations for points on\nX in Section 3. Then we describe the geometry of related G-varieties\nin PV = P(A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C) in Section 4.\nWe let I(X)d denote the degree d piece of I(X), and denote by\nMd (X), (or Md when the context is clear), the (vector space of) minimal\ngenerators of I(X) occurring in degree d. The group G acts on X and\nthus on I(X). This facilitates the search for all polynomials in I(X)d in\nlow degree (for d \u2264 9) via computations using classical representation\ntheory. In Section 5 we describe our computations and identify which\nmodules of polynomials are minimal generators assisted by symbolic\ncomputations in Maple and Macaulay2. In particular, we find that the\nonly minimal generators of I(X) for d \u2264 9 occur in degrees 3, 5 and 6.\nNext, we compute a Gr\u00f6bner basis of the ideal J = hM3 + M5 + M6 i,\nand find (again in Macaulay2) that the degree of J is 297.\nAnother valuable tool for understanding the zero-set of a collection\nof polynomials is a numerical primary decomposition via numerical\nalgebraic geometry. For this we used Bertini [BHSW10] for experiments\nand computations; see also [SW05]. In Section 6 we consider only M3 ,\nthe lowest degree (degree 3) part of I(X), which has a basis of 10\npolynomials in the 27 variables. Here we obtain a numerical primary\ndecomposition of V (M3 ) using Bertini. In particular, we find that up\nto the numerical accuracy of Bertini, V (M3 ) has 4 components, and\nwe are even given their degrees. This numerical result provides us with\ntangible data from which we are able to conjecture (and eventually\nprove) the true structure of V (M3 ). In particular, we find that up to\nthe numerical accuracy of Bertini, X has degree 297.\nIn Section 7 we use geometric considerations and resort to Nurmiev's\nclassification of orbits and their closures ([Nur00b, Nur00a]) to geometrically identify all the components found by the Bertini computation.\nThis geometric understanding allows us to conclude in\n\u221a Proposition 7.4\nthat the zero-set V(J) is equal to X (as sets), so J = I(X). In\nSection 8 we again use the classification of orbits and the orbit poset\nstructure to show in Theorem 8.5 that J is prime and thus J = I(X).\n3. The trifocal variety as an orbit closure\nConsider V = A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C and the natural left action of G =\nSL(A) \u00d7 SL(B) \u00d7 SL(C) ' SL(3)\u00d73 on V . There is also a natural\naction of the symmetric group S3 permuting the three factors in the\ntensor product, and it is easy to see that X is invariant under the action\nof the S2 permuting A\u2217 and B \u2217 . However, this finite invariance does\nnot provide much computational advantage.\n\n\f6\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nRemark 3.1. Since we are working over C we consider general changes\nof coordinates by SL(3, C). However, were we to work over R, we would\nwant to change our analysis to consider rotations in the three planes,\nand the group action would be by SO(3, R)\u00d73 .\nSince the trifocal variety X \u2282 PV is invariant under changes of coordinates in the camera planes, we say that X is a G-variety. Moreover,\n[AT10] shows that X is actually the closure of a single G-orbit in PV .\nBecause G ' SL(3)\u00d73 is 24 dimensional acting on V ' C3 \u2297 C3 \u2297 C3 ,\nwhich is 27 dimensional, there must be infinitely many G-orbits in V .\nEven so, the orbits happen to have been classified, apparently independently, by several authors. Since elements of V can be interpreted in\na number of ways (as triples of 3 \u00d7 3 matrices or 3 \u00d7 3 matrices with\nlinear entries depending on 3 variables, as 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 trilinear forms or\nternary trilinear forms, as cuboids\nor elements of a triple tensor prodV\nuct, or as a G-submodule of 3 C9 ), the various classifications occurred\nin different settings - see [TC38, Ng95, Nur00b].\nWe prefer to use Nurmiev's version of the classification, which follows\nVinberg's conventions and uses the results and techniques of [V\u00c878].\nOne main reason for this choice is that Nurmiev also computed the\nclosures of all the nilpotent orbits in a note [Nur00a], in the same language as the previous paper. There are 4 continuous families of orbits\ncalled semi-simple orbits, and one finite family of nilpotent orbits. To\nevery orbit O is associated a normal form, which is a representative\nv \u2208 V such that G.v = O. Though obviously not unique, we will typically choose a normal form that is as simple as possible, or that clearly\nreveals some of the structure of the orbit.\nTo use the Nurmiev classification, we first identify the trifocal variety\nas one of the orbits on Nurmiev's list. Indeed, Alzati and Tortora give\na normal form for the orbit of trifocal tensors that we now recall. A\ngeneral trifocal tensor T may be, after a possible change of coordinates\nby G, identified as a tensor whose slices in the C-direction are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u22121 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nT 1 = \uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8 T 2 = \uf8ed0 \u22121 0\uf8f8 T 3 = \uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 \u22121 1\nChoose bases A\u2217 = span{a1 , a2 , a3 }, B \u2217 = span{b1 , b2 , b3 }, and C =\nspan{c1 , c2 , c3 }. Then we can write\nT = (\u2212a1 ) \u2297 b2 \u2297 c1 + (\u2212a3 ) \u2297 (\u2212b1 ) \u2297 c1 + (\u2212a2 ) \u2297 b2 \u2297 c2\n+a3 \u2297 b2 \u2297 c2 \u2212 a3 \u2297 b2 \u2297 c3 + a3 \u2297 b3 \u2297 c3 ,\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n7\n\nwhich by changing coordinates (via G) may be written as\nT = a1 \u2297 b 2 \u2297 c 1 + a3 \u2297 b 1 \u2297 c 1 + a2 \u2297 b 2 \u2297 c 2 + a3 \u2297 b 3 \u2297 c 3 .\nIt is also useful to express a tensor T via matrices with linear entries.\nFor this, one considers a pure tensor ai \u2297 bj \u2297 ck as a matrix with an\nai in the j, k position of the matrix. Then do this for all pure tensors\nin an expression for T and add the matrices. In fact, this describes the\nprojections for the P-Rank varieties defined in Section 4. A normal\nform for the trifocal variety has matrices of linear forms\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na3 0 0\nb2 0 0\n0 c1 0\nT (A) = \uf8eda1 a2 0 \uf8f8 , T (B) = \uf8ed 0 b2 0 \uf8f8 , T (C) = \uf8ed 0 c2 0 \uf8f8 .\n0 0 a3\nb1 0 b3\nc1 0 c3\nThe difference here is that T (A), T (B), T (C) each individually represent T , but the entire set {T 1 , T 2 , T 3 } also represents T . One advantage to considering a tensor as a matrix in linear forms is that it is\nnow clear that P-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 2), so X \u2282 P-Rank3,3,2 . In particular, T (C) has rank 2, and thus must satisfy the equations implied by\ndet(T (C)) \u2261 0, while T (A) and T (B) do not satisfy this relation.\nRemark 3.2. The construction of the matrix T (A) from the tensor T\nshows that the G action on T corresponds to an action on the matrix\nT (A) by left and right multiplication by elements of SL(B) and SL(C),\nand by linear changes of variables on the entries of T (A), with similar\ndescriptions for the action on T (B) and T (C).\nNurmiev lists the G-orbits in V as a list of integers. To a triple of\nintegers ijk Nurmiev associates the tensor ei \u2297 ej \u2297 ek , with 1 \u2264 i, j \u2212\n3, k \u2212 6 \u2264 3. The spaces in each expression corresponds to summation.\nFor example, consider orbit 11 on Nurmiev's list: 149 167 248 357.\nWe choose bases of A\u2217 , B \u2217 and C so that ai = ei , bj\u22123 = ej , and\nck\u22126 = ek . So orbit 11 corresponds to the tensor\na1 \u2297 b 1 \u2297 c 3 + a1 \u2297 b 3 \u2297 c 1 + a2 \u2297 b 1 \u2297 c 2 + a3 \u2297 b 2 \u2297 c 1 ,\nwhich corresponds to the matrix\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ed a3\na1\n\nof linear forms\n\uf8f6\na2 a1\n0 0\uf8f8.\n0 0\n\nFinally, notice that T (C), for instance, can be moved by a change of\ncoordinates to\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 c1 0\n0 0 c1\n0 c1 c3\n0 c3 c1\nT (C) = \uf8ed 0 c2 0 \uf8f8 \u223c\n= \uf8ed 0 0 c2 \uf8f8 \u223c\n= \uf8ed c1 0 0 \uf8f8 \u223c\n= \uf8ed c2 0 0 \uf8f8 .\nc1 0 c3\nc2 0 0\nc1 0 0\nc1 c3 0\n\n\f8\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nThen swapping the roles of c2 and c3\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u223c\n\uf8ed\nT (C) = c3\nc1\n\nwe obtain\n\uf8f6\nc2 c1\n0 0\uf8f8.\n0 0\n\nThis shows that the normal form of T is congruent to orbit 1100 on\nNurmiev's list (where representative 1100 is obtained from representative\n11 by performing the permutation a \u2192 b \u2192 c \u2192 a twice).\nNurmiev's list also contains the dimension of the stabilizer of this\norbit. This confirms for us that the codimension of the trifocal variety\nX is 8 (an already well-established fact).\nOne of the utilities of having a group action is the following. If a\ngroup G \u2282 GL(V ) preserves a variety X \u2282 PV (i.e. G.X = X), we\nmay consider I(X) as a G-module and in particular as a G-submodule\nof S \u2022 V \u2217 , the space of symmetric tensors on V . Recall that S \u2022 V \u2217 is\nisomorphic to the space of homogeneous polynomials on V . The representation theory of G = SL(A) \u00d7 SL(B) \u00d7 SL(C)-modules is well\nknown; however, the reader may wish to consult [Lan12] or [FH91] for\nreference. One fact we will use is if V = A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C, then irreducible\nG-modules in S \u2022 V \u2217 are all of the form S\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297 S\u03bd C \u2217 , where \u03bb, \u03bc\nand \u03bd are all partitions of the same nonnegative integer.\n4. F-Rank and P-Rank varieties\nIn the previous section we saw that the matrices T 1 , T 2 , T 3 representing the slices of a trifocal tensor do not have full rank. This condition\ndepends on the choice of coordinates. On the other hand, the 3 \u00d7 9\nflattening matrix (T 1 | T 2 | T 3 ) does have full rank, and this condition\nis not dependent on the choice of coordinates. Of course slicing in a\ndifferent direction may yield a different result, but it is easy to check\nthat trifocal tensors have full rank flattenings for all slices. We refer to\nthis condition as flattening rank (F-Rank), and note that the general\ntrifocal tensor has F-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 3).\nThe matrix T (C) with linear forms in C does not have full rank,\nwhile the matrices T (A) and T (B) do have full rank. The construction\nof T (C) describes a projection A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 \u2297 C \u2192 A\u2217 \u2297 B \u2217 , so it is natural\nto refer to the tuple of ranks of the various projections as projection\nrank (P-Rank). A general trifocal tensor T has P-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 2).\nThese two considerations lead to the study of subspace varieties (the\nformer) and rank varieties (the latter). Understanding algebraic and\ngeometric properties of these varieties will help us find equations for the\ntrifocal variety. In what follows we highlight some of these properties,\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n9\n\nwhich are specific cases of much more general constructions. For more\ndetails, see [Lan12, Chapter 7]).\n4.1. Subspace varieties. For p \u2264 3, q \u2264 3, r \u2264 3, the subspace\nvariety Subp,q,r \u2282 PV is the projectivization of the set of tensors that\nhave F-Rank at most (p, q, r):\nSubp,q,r = P{T \u2208 V | F-Rank(T ) \u2264 (p, q, r)},\nwhere we write (a, b, c) \u2264 (p, q, r) if a \u2264 p and b \u2264 q and c \u2264 r. Subspace varieties are irreducible, and their ideals are defined by minors of\nflattenings (see [LW07, Theorem 3.1]). For the sake of a reader unfamiliar with these concepts, we recall the construction of these equations.\nA tensor T \u2208 V is realized via 27 variables Ti,j,k for 1 \u2264 i, j, k \u2264 3\nT =\n\n3\nX\n\nTi,j,k ai \u2297 bj \u2297 ck ,\n\ni,j,k=1\n\nchoosing bases {a1 , a2 , a3 }, {b1 , b2 , b3 }, and {c1 , c2 , c3 } of A\u2217 , B \u2217 and\nC respectively. There are three directions in which we may slice T\nto get triples of matrices. Let Wi = (Ti,j,k )j,k , Yj = (Ti,j,k )i,k , Zk =\n(Ti,j,k )i,j denote these slices. Then the matrices W = (W1 | W2 | W3 )\n- respectively Y = (Y1 | Y2 | Y3 ), and Z = (Z1 | Z2 | Z3 ) - are the\nthree flattenings with respect to the three slicings of the tensor T .\nA special case of [LW07, Theorem 3.1] is that the ideals generated by\nthe 3-minors of flattenings are the ideals of subspace varieties. Namely,\nI(Sub2,3,3 ) = hminors(3, W )i,\nI(Sub3,2,3 ) = hminors(3, Y )i,\nI(Sub3,3,2 ) = hminors(3, Z)i.\nMoreover, the intersection of two subspace varieties yields another, and\nthis holds ideal theoretically as well. Sub2,2,3 = Sub2,3,3 \u2229 Sub3,2,3 and\nI(Sub2,2,3 ) = hminors(3, W )i + hminors(3, Y )i,\nand similarly for permutations. Likewise\nI(Sub2,2,2 ) = hminors(3, W )i + hminors(3, Y )i + hminors(3, Z)i.\nIt is also easy to check the dimensions of subspace varieties. A convenient tool is to use the Kempf-Weyman desingularization via vector\nbundles. Let Si denote the canonical (subspace) rank i vector bundle\nover the Grassmannian Gr(i, n). The desingularization is\nP(Sp \u2297 Sq \u2297 Sr ) \u00d7 Gr(p, 3) \u00d7 Gr(q, 3) \u00d7 Gr(r, 3) 99K Subp,q,r .\n\n\f10\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nIn particular, we have\ndim(Subp,q,r ) = pqr \u2212 1 + p(3 \u2212 p) + q(3 \u2212 q) + r(3 \u2212 r).\nWe computed the degrees of each subspace variety using Macaulay 2:\nvariety\nSub2,3,3 Sub2,2,3 Sub2,2,2\ndimension\n19\n15\n13\ncodimension\n7\n11\n13\ndegree\n36\n306\n783\nAnother description of I(Subp,q,r ) in Representation Theoretic language will allow us to compare the equations here with any other Ginvariant sets of equations, no matter how they are presented. Another way to state [LW07, Theorem 3.1] is that for each integer d,\nI(Subp,q,r )d consists of all representations S\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297 S\u03bd C \u2217 with partitions \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd ` d such that either |\u03bb| > p, |\u03bc| > q or |\u03bd| > r.\nIn fact, the ideals of subspace varieties are generated in the minimal\ndegree d possible. To save space, we write S\u03bb S\u03bc S\u03bd for the representation\nV\nS\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297 S\u03bd C \u2217 , and 3 in place of S111\nV V\nV\nVV\nI(Sub2,3,3 ) = h 3 3 S 3 \u2295 3 S21 S21 \u2295 3 S 3 3 i\nV\nVV\nI(Sub223 ) = I(Sub233 ) + hS21 3 S21 \u2295 S 3 3 3 i\nV\nI(Sub2,2,2 ) = I(Sub2,2,3 ) + hS21 S21 3 i\nFinally, comparing to Nurmiev's list [Nur00a], the variety Sub2,3,3\ncorresponds to nilpotent orbit 9 (and 90 and 900 correspond to permutations of Sub2,3,3 ). The variety Sub2,2,3 corresponds to nilpotent orbit\nnumber 17 (and 170 and 1700 for permutations). Sub2,2,2 is also equal\nto the secant variety of a Segre product, \u03c32 (Seg(P2 \u00d7 P2 \u00d7 P2 )) and\ncorresponds to nilpotent orbit number 20 on Nurmiev's list.\n4.2. P-Rank varieties. P-Rank varieties are defined by considering\nthe three images of the projections of a tensor onto two of the factors\nand restricting the rank of points in the image. In particular (see\n[Lan12, \u00a77.2.2]) RankrA is the projectivization of the set\n{T \u2208 V | rank(T (A)) \u2264 r},\nwhere if T has slices (in the A\u2217 -direction) W1 , W2 and W3 , T (A) is\nthe matrix W1 + W2 + W3 . RankrB and RankrC are defined similarly.\nLet P-Rankp,q,r denote the projectivization of the set of tensors T with\nP-Rank(T ) \u2264 (p, q, r). Equivalently,\nP-Rankp,q,r = RankpA \u2229 RankqB \u2229 RankrC .\nIt is easy to check that P-Rankp,q,r is SL(A)\u00d7SL(B)\u00d7SL(C)-invariant.\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n11\n\nWhile P-Rank varieties can be considered in arbitrary dimensions,\nwe restrict to the case that A, B and C are 3-dimensional.\nLandsberg points out that RankrA is usually far from irreducible. In\nparticular, there are at least two subspace varieties in Rank2A\nSub3,3,2 \u222a Sub3,2,3 \u2282 Rank2A = P-Rank2,3,3 .\nIn fact, we will see later that there is yet another component. Similarly\nSub3,3,2 \u222a Sub3,2,3 \u2282 P-Rank2,3,3 ,\nSub3,3,2 \u222a Sub2,3,3 \u2282 P-Rank3,2,3\nimply a third containment Sub3,3,2 \u222a Sub2,2,3 \u2282 P-Rank2,2,3 .\nMoreover the 3-way intersection certainly contains the following\nSub3,2,2 \u222a Sub2,3,2 \u222a Sub2,2,3 \u2282 P-Rank2,2,2 .\nBut, in fact, all of the inclusions above are strict containments.\nIn Section 7 we consider the poset of orbit closures in P-Rank3,3,2 .\nThis will allow us to show that P-Rank2,2,2 is irreducible and corresponds to the orbit closure consisting of tensors whose projections\nT (A), T (B) and T (C) are skew-symmetrizable 3 \u00d7 3 matrices. One can\nalso show that the irreducible components of P-Rank3,2,2 are Sub3,3,2\nand P-Rank2,2,2 (which contains Sub2,2,3 ). Further, we'll see that P-Rank3,3,2\nconsists of four distinct components, namely the two subspace varieties\nSub2,3,3 \u222a Sub3,2,3 , the trifocal variety X, and P-Rank2,2,2 .\n5. Symbolic computations using Representation Theory\nIn this section we compute the trifocal ideal I(X) up to degree 9,\nand then find the minimal generators among those polynomials.\nA systematic algorithm to compute all polynomials in low degree\nin the ideal of a G-variety is described in [LM04]. We carry out this\nalgorithm for the trifocal variety. In a word, the test is to decompose\nthe ambient coordinate ring as a G-module and check every module of\nequations in low degree for membership via representation theory.\nRecall that the trifocal variety X is the closure of a G-orbit in PV ,\nwith G = SL(A) \u00d7 SL(B) \u00d7 SL(C). This allows us to use tools from\nrepresentation theory to compute and understand the ideal of X.\nThe coordinate ring of PV has a G-module decomposition in each\ndegree as\nM\nS dV \u2217 =\n(S\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297 S\u03bd C \u2217 ) \u2297 Cm\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd ,\n\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd`d\n\nwhere S\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297 S\u03bd C \u2217 is an isotypic module associated to partitions\n\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd of d, and m\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd is the multiplicity of that isotypic component,\n\n\f12\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\n[LM04, Proposition 4.1]. One advantage to considering polynomials in\nmodules is that we can compare different sets of polynomials no matter\nin what basis they are presented and determine if they are the same.\nEven more useful is the following. Because we have a reductive group\nacting, we have the following splitting as G-modules\nk[V ] = I(X) \u2295 k[V ]/I(X).\nTo determine I(X), then we just need to determine which irreducible\nG-modules are in I(X).\nHere is a short synopsis of the algorithm in [LM04]. Suppose M is\nan irreducible G-module in S \u2022 V \u2217 . To determine whether M \u2282 I(X)\nor M \u2282 k[V ]/I(X), it suffices to check whether a random point on X\nvanishes on the highest weight vector of M . Random points of X may\nbe constructed by acting on a normal form by random elements of G.\nIf M is an isotypic component of S \u2022 V \u2217 that occurs with multiplicity\nm, we first construct a basis of the highest weight space Cm of M , by a\nstraightforward construction involving Young symmetrizers. Then we\nselect m random points from X and construct an m \u00d7 m matrix whose\ni, j-entry is the ith point evaluated on jth basis vector. The kernel of\nthis matrix tells the linear subspace of M that is in the ideal of X.\nOf course because we use random points, we should then re-verify\nall vanishing results symbolically to rule out false positives (there are\nno false negatives because non-vanishing at random points of X implies non-vanishing on X.) We did these extensive computations in\nMaple, and we have provided a sample of our code in the ancillary files\naccompanying the arXiv version of this article.\nWe can further determine which among the polynomial modules we\nfind are actually minimal generators. Suppose the degree d piece of\nthe ideal, I(X)d , is known and has been input into Macaulay2 as I.\nThen in the next step of the Landsberg-Manivel algorithm, for each\nnew highest weight vector f (a polynomial of degree d + 1) check if\nf \u2208 hI(X)d i by quickly computing f%I. The module {G.f } associated\nto the highest weight vector f is in hI(X)d i if and only if f%I is zero.\nWe tabulate the results of this test applied to the trifocal variety\nbelow. Again, to save space we write S\u03bb S\u03bc S\u03bd in place of S\u03bb A \u2297 S\u03bc B \u2297\nS\u03bd C \u2217 . The trifocal variety has an S2 symmetry permuting the A\u2217 and\nB \u2217 factors. To further save space, where appropriate, we will write\nS2 .(S\u03bb S\u03bc )S\u03bd to indicate the sum S\u03bb S\u03bc S\u03bd + S\u03bc S\u03bb S\u03bd .\nProposition 5.1. Let X denote the trifocal variety in PV and let Md\ndenote the space of minimal generators in degree d of I(X). There are\n10 minimal generators in degree 3, 81 in degree 5, and 1980 in degree\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n13\n\n6. The G-module structure of the minimal generators is as follows.\nVV\nM3 = 3 3 S 3 ,\nM5 = (S221 S221 )(S311 \u2295 S221 )\nM6 = (S2 .(S222 S33 )(S33 \u2295 S411 )) \u2295 S2 .(S33 S321 )S321\n\u2295 (S2 .(S33 S411 ) \u2295 S33 S33 ) S222 ,\nand there are no other minimal generators in degree \u2264 9.\nBy recording the dimension of all modules that occur, this computes\nthe first nine values of the Hilbert function of k[V ]/I(X):\n27, 378, 3644, 27135, 166050, 865860, 3942162, 15966072, 58409126.\nDuring our tests in Maple, we computed a basis of each module and\nprovide these equations in the ancillary files accompanying the arXiv\nversion of this paper.\nWe relate some of the polynomials we found to the known polynomials in [AT10].\nproves that RankrA is the zero-set of S r+1 A \u2297\nV\nVr+1 Landsberg\nr+1\nB\u2297\nC \u2217 [Lan12, Proposition 7.2.2.2]. One can also phrase the\ncondition that T \u2208 RankrA as the requirement that the matrix T (A) of\nlinear forms from A has rank notVexceedingVr. If A is m-dimensional,\na basis of the module S r+1 A \u2297 r+1 B \u2297 r+1 C is given as follows.\nConsider the slices T 1 , . . . , T m of T in the A-direction,\nand dummy\nP\ni\nx\nT\n)\n\u2264 r is the\nvariables x1 , . . . , xm .

So a basis of S\nis given by the (polynomial) coefficients of these minors.\nRecall that a normal form for a point T on the trifocal variety has\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 c2 c1\nT (C) \u223c\n= \uf8edc3 0 0 \uf8f8 .\nc1 0 0\nAnd this matrix clearly has rank \u2264 2.\nThe above discussion implies that X \u2282 Rank2C , and the module\nV\nV\nM3 := 3 A \u2297 3 B \u2297 S 3 C \u2217\nis in the trifocal ideal. These equations were also identified in [AT10].\nWe now describe the two modules in M5 . The highest weight vectors\nare polynomials with (respectively) 104 and 244 monomials and multi\ndegrees [(2,2,1),(2,2,1),(3,1,1)] and [(2,2,1),(2,2,1),(2,2,1)], in the ring\nk[a11 , . . . , a33 , b11 , . . . , b33 , c11 , . . . , c33 ].\n\n\fCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\n14\n\nHere we are using aij to denote Tij1 , bij = Tij2 , and cij = Tij3 .

The basis of S221 S221 S221 consists of 27 polynomials which\nare all equal after a change of indices. All the coefficients come from\nthe set {\u22125, \u22122, \u22121, 1, 2, 4}. The basis of S221 S221 S311 consists of 54\npolynomials which are of two different types having either 104 or 64\nmonomials and coefficients in the set {\u22121, 1}. The polynomials themselves can be downloaded from the web as mentioned above.\nFor M6 we can give a similar description. S222 S33 S33 and S222 S33 S411\nand S33 S222 S411 are all 100-dimensional, each with a basis consisting of\npolynomials that have between 66 and 666 monomials and small (absolute value no greater than 4) integer coefficients.

Numerical Algebraic Geometry: Bertini\nIn Numerical algebraic geometry, and specifically using the program\nBertini, one can compute numerical primary decompositions of ideals\nif the number of equations and the degrees of those equations are relatively small. In contrast to Gr\u00f6bner basis computations where typically\nmore equations is better, in numerical algebraic geometry it is better\nto start with the lowest degree and lowest number of equations that\none can understand. Then one can try to compute a numerical primary decomposition and attempt to work by other means to obtain a\ngeometric description of the components indicated by Bertini.\nFollowing this philosophy, we started with the 10 equations in degree\n3 given by the complete vanishing of\ndet(x1 Z1 + x2 Z2 + x3 Z3 ),\nwhich define Rank2C . Recall that (Z1 | Z2 | Z3 ) is the flattening of\na tensor in the C-direction. These are specifically the 10 equations\ndefining the module M3 ; that is, a basis for M3 .\nAfter about 6.5 hours of computational time on 2 processors (and\nsome help from J. Hauenstein getting the initial parameters right), or\njust under 10 minutes on Hauenstein's cluster, Bertini succeeded to\ncompute the following numerical decomposition.\nComputation 6.1. Let M3 denote the 10 coefficients (in x1 , x2 , x3 ) of\nthe cubic det(x1 Z1 + x2 Z2 + x3 Z3 ). Up to the numerical precision of\nBertini, the zero set of M3 has precisely 4 components:\nIn codimension 7 there are 2 components, each of degree 36.\nIn codimension 8 there is 1 component of degree 297.\nIn codimension 10 there is 1 component of degree 1035.\nIt is not too hard to show that the two components in codim 7 are\nthe subspace varieties\nSub3,2,3 \u222a Sub2,3,3\n\n\f16\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nThis is because they have the correct dimension, M3 is in both ideals,\nand their ideals are generated (respectively) by\nVV\nVV\nVV\nV V\n( 3 3 S 3 ) \u2295 (S 3 3 3 )\nand\n( 3 3 S 3 ) \u2295 ( 3 S 3 3 ).\nWe know that the trifocal tensor variety is in the zero set and has\ncodimension 8. It is not contained in either subspace variety, so we\nmay conclude that X corresponds to the codimension 8 component in\nthe numerical decomposition. We also learn that X has degree 297.\nThe variety P-Rank2,2,2 must correspond to the codimension 10 component, which we prove in Proposition 7.2 below. In addition, this\nBertini computation also tells that P-Rank2,2,2 has degree 1035.\n7. Nurmiev's classification of orbit closures and the\nproof of the main theorem\nThe orbits of SL(3)\u00d73 acting on C3 \u2297 C3 \u2297 C3 have been classified by\nNurmiev [Nur00b], who also computed the closure of most orbits.\nUsing Nurmiev's list of normal forms, we can quickly check which\norbits are contained in V(M3 ) by taking a parameterized representative\nfor each orbit (normal form) and evaluating the polynomials in M3\non that representative. This can be carried out in a straightforward\nmanner in any computer algebra system.\nThe following orbits from Nurmiev's list of nilpotent orbits [Nur00a,\nTable 4] are in V(M3 ): 9, 90 , 1100 , 12, 120 , 13, 130 , 14, 15, 150 , 16, 160 ,\n17, 170 , 1700 , 18, 180 , 1800 , 19, 190 , 1900 , 20 (= 200 = 2000 ), 21, 210 , 2100 ,\n22, 220 , 23, 230 , 2300 , 24 (= 240 = 2400 ), 25 (= \u2205), see [Nur00b] for an\nexplanation of the notation used.\nAfter considering the nilpotent orbits, we must also consider the\nsemi-simple orbits together with their nilpotent parts. Among these\norbits, our tests found that only one semi-simple orbit, namely the one\ncorresponding to Nurmiev's fourth family, is in V(M3 ). In our notation\nwe may represent this normal form as\nF = \u03bb(a1 \u2297 b2 \u2297 c3 + a2 \u2297 b3 \u2297 c1 + a3 \u2297 b1 \u2297 c2\n\u2212 a1 \u2297 b3 \u2297 c2 \u2212 a2 \u2297 b1 \u2297 c3 \u2212 a3 \u2297 b2 \u2297 c1 ),\nfor any scalar \u03bb 6= 0, but over the complex numbers this scalar may be\nabsorbed.\nRemark 7.1. As a matrix with linear entries either in A\u2217 , B \u2217 or C a\nnormal form for F is always of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\nx \u2212y\n\uf8ed\u2212x 0\nz \uf8f8.\ny \u2212z 0\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n17\n\nNamely this orbit corresponds to the skew symmetric matrices. Moreover, since this matrix is skew-symmetric, it always has even rank, and\nthus we find that F \u2208 P-Rank2,2,2 with no computation necessary.\nNext we consider the closures of all the nilpotent orbits in [Nur00a,\nTable 4]. Our inclusion poset diagram in Figure 2 is enlightening.\nFor all arrows except for those emanating from F , the diagram is a\nrestatement of results in [Nur00a]. Namely, if orbit Q is in the closure\nof orbit P (as indicated by Nurmiev's table) and there isn't already a\ndirected path from P to Q we draw an arrow from P to Q.\nWe then consider all orbits that are in the zero set of M3 for all\npermutations of A,B and C. We write this zero set in shorthand as\nV(S3 .M3 ). Since F is a zero of S3 .M3 , every orbit in its closure must\nalso be in this zero set. A straightforward computation shows that\nthese orbits in V(S3 .M3 ) are numbers 17-21, 23, 24 (and all of their\nprimed versions). Of course this does not imply that these orbits are\nactually in the closure of F . However, it is enough to check that orbits\n17, 18 (and their primed versions) are in the closure of F .\nProposition 7.2. The zero set V(S3 .M3 ) (which equals P-Rank2,2,2 by\ndefinition) is irreducible and is the closure of the orbit F above.\nMoreover, the orbit associated to the normal form F is not contained\nin any of the other orbit closures in Figure 2\nProof. This proof is entirely computational, but since we did not find\nit in the literature, we provide the computations here.\nOrbit closures consist of one orbit of the top dimension along with\nother orbits of lower dimension. So we conclude by counting dimensions\nthat none of the orbits 9, 90 , 1100 , 12, 120 , 13, 130 , 14, 15 or 150 are in\nthe closure of F . Later we will show that 17, 18 and all their primed\nversions are in the closure of F .\nWe claim that none of the orbits of higher dimension (9, 90 , 1100 , 12,\n120 , 13, 130 ) contain F in their closure.

We already noted that\nthe skew-symmetric matrices in F has rank 2 or less and thus vanishes\non all polynomials in M3 . The ideal I(X) has no minimal generators in\ndegree 4, so we must start to consider polynomials in degree 5 or higher.\nHere we notice by direct computation that neither of the modules in\nM5 vanish on F , separating F from X.\nAnother way to conclude Rank2C 6\u2282 V(M5 ), without computation,\nV3 V3 is\nS3 .\nto consider the degree 5 piece of the ideal generated by M3 =\nThe Pieri formula gives that every module of I(M3 ) in degree 5 must\nhave a partition in the first position whose first part is at least 3. On\nthe other hand, the module S221 S221 S221 in M5 fails this property. So\nit cannot be in the ideal I(M3 ) of Rank2C , and thus Rank2C 6\u2282 X.\nAny orbit in V(M3 ) is either in the closure of F or in the closure of\n9, 90 or 1100 . Moreover, because F is not in the closure of 9, 90 or 1100 ,\nits closure must be an irreducible component of V(M3 ).\nSince S3 .M3 manifestly has S3 symmetry, so does its zero-set. Thus\nto prove that V(S3 .M3 ) is irreducible, we need to show that orbits 17,\n18 and their primed versions are contained in the closure of F . This will\nimply irreducibility of V(S3 .M3 ) because every orbit contained there\nis in the closure of a single orbit.\nSince F is symmetric with respect to permutation by S3 , it suffices\nto prove that orbits 17 and 18 are contained in the closure of F . To do\nthis we exhibit a sequence of points in the orbit of F that converge to\neach orbit. We prefer to work with the normal forms both as tensors\nand as matrices of linear forms. The group operations allowed are row\nand column operations as well as general linear changes of coordinates\non each linear form appearing.\nNurmiev's orbit 17 has normal form given by the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 a1 a2\n\uf8eda1 0 0 \uf8f8 ,\na2 0 0\nor the tensor\na1 \u2297 (b1 \u2297 c2 + b2 \u2297 c1 ) + a2 \u2297 (b1 \u2297 c3 + b3 \u2297 c1 ).\nReplacing b1 with \u2212b1 we obtain the tensor\na1 \u2297 (\u2212b1 \u2297 c2 + b2 \u2297 c1 ) + a2 \u2297 (\u2212b1 \u2297 c3 + b3 \u2297 c1 )\n\n\f20\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\n= \u2212a1 \u2297 b1 \u2297 c2 + a1 \u2297 b2 \u2297 c1 ) + \u2212a2 \u2297 b1 \u2297 c3 + a2 \u2297 b3 \u2297 c1 ),\nwhich corresponds to the (skew symmetric) matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u2212a1 \u2212a2\n\uf8ed a1 0\n0 \uf8f8.\na2 0\n0\nThis matrix is a limit of the following matrices in the orbit of F\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u2212a1 \u2212a2\n\uf8eda1 0\nzn \uf8f8 ,\na2 \u2212zn 0\nwhere zn \u2192 0.\nFor the orbit 18, we consider the following representative as a tensor\na1 \u2297 (b1 \u2297 c1 + b2 \u2297 c2 ) + a2 \u2297 (b1 \u2297 c2 + b2 \u2297 c3 )\nwhich corresponds to the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na1 a2 0\n\uf8ed 0 a1 a2 \uf8f8 .\n0 0 0\nBy cycling rows 1, 2 and 3 we at least have a matrix with 0 diagonal,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 a1 a2\n\uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8.\na1 a2 0\nNow we work with the following\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ed\u2212x\ny\n\nmatrix normal form for F :\n\uf8f6\nx \u2212y\n0\nz \uf8f8\n\u2212z 0,\n\nwhich corresponds to the tensor\nF = z\u2297b2 \u2297c3 +y\u2297b3 \u2297c1 +x\u2297b1 \u2297c2 \u2212z\u2297b3 \u2297c2 \u2212y\u2297b1 \u2297c3 \u2212x\u2297b2 \u2297c1 .\nFirst we set x = a1 and \u2212y = a2 .

Namely the orbit of trifocal tensors\nis precisely the G-invariant set of tensors with P-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 2)\nor some permutation thereof, and F-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 3). These two\nconditions contain both vanishing and non-vanishing conditions. We\nphrase this as an algorithm to determine whether a given tensor is a\ntrifocal tensor.\nAlgorithm 1.\nInput: A tensor T \u2208 C3 \u2297 C3 \u2297 C3 .\n\u2022 Replace T by a change of coordinates (either arbitrary or random) from GL(A) \u00d7 GL(B) \u00d7 GL(C) applied to T .\n\u2022 Compute the projections T (A), T (B), T (C). Is P-Rank(T ) =\n(3, 3, 2) (or some permutation) and no less?\nNO: stop, T is not a trifocal tensor.\nYES: continue\n\u2022 Compute all 3 flattenings. Is F-Rank(T ) = (3, 3, 3) and no less?\nNO: stop, T is not a trifocal tensor.\nYES: T is a trifocal tensor.\nIf one uses arbitrary changes of coordinates (with parameters) the\nconclusions of Algorithm 1 hold without modification. However, it may\nbe difficult to perform the tests. If one uses random changes of coordinates, Algorithm 1 will go quickly, and the negative conclusions are\nsure, but the positive conclusions will hold only with high probability.\nThis test is effective because it involves computing the ranks of three\n3 \u00d7 3 matrices and the ranks of three 3 \u00d7 9 matrices. This test is similar\nin spirit to the results in [AT10, Section 4].\nProposition 7.2 yields the following geometric statement.\nProposition 7.3. Let X denote the trifocal variety (the closure of orbit\n1100 ). Then the irreducible decomposition of V(M3 ) = P-Rank3,3,2 is\nV(M3 ) = Sub2,3,3 \u222a Sub3,2,3 \u222aX \u222a P-Rank2,2,2 .\nProof. To see that V(M3 ) contains the four listed components, just\nconstruct a normal form for each and notice that the associated matrix\nin linear forms has rank < 3. To see that these are the only components, look at the orbit closure diagram in Figure 2, which displays\nall orbits in V(M3 ) and is justified by [Nur00a] and Proposition 7.2.\nNotice that there are 4 sources in the directed graph representing the\nposet and these correspond to the only irreducible components in the\ndecomposition.\n\u0003\n\n\f22\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nNurmiev's table includes the dimension of the stabilizer of each orbit,\nwhich tells the codimension of each of the components: codim(Sub2,3,3 ) =\n7, codim(X) = 8, codim(P-Rank2,2,2 ) = 10. Nurmiev's computation is\nconfirmed by the computation done in Bertini; however, Bertini tells\nus a bit more, namely the degree of each component.\nProposition 7.4. The zero set V(M3 + M5 + M6 ) is irreducible and\nagrees with X set-theoretically.\nProof. We need to show that when we intersect V(M3 ) with V(M5 +M6 )\nthat all of the orbits that remain are actually in the trifocal variety. It\nsuffices to show that orbits 17, 17', 18', 18\" are not in V(M5 +M6 ). This\nis because by considering the orbit closure poset diagram in Figure 2,\nthese orbits are contained in all other orbits in V(M3 ) that are not in\nthe trifocal variety X, so if they are not in V(M5 + M6 ), then no other\nG-orbit in V(M3 ) outside of X is in V(M3 + M5 + M6 ).\nBy direct computation, we find that the module S33 S222 S411 does not\nvanish on orbit 17, the module S222 S33 S411 does not vanish on orbit 17',\nthe module S33 S33 S222 does not vanish on 18', and S222 S33 S33 does not\nvanish on 18\". On the other hand, each of these modules are in M6 . \u0003\n8. The ideal J is prime\nLet J = hM3 + M5 + M6 i, where Md are the minimal generators of\nI(X) in degree d. The trifocal variety X is irreducible because it is a\nparameterized variety. The fact that the zero set V (J) is irreducible\nand equals X is the content of Proposition 7.4. So I(X) and J agree up\nto radical. It remains to check that there are no embedded components.\nThe classification of G-orbits in V also yields a classification of minimal G-invariant prime ideals. To every orbit is associated the prime\nideal of its orbit closure.\nRemark 8.1. Here we also use the fact that if G is a connected group,\nand J is a G-stable ideal, then the minimal primes in any primary\ndecomposition of J are G-stable. This essentially follows from the fact\nthat if J = \u2229i Qi is a primary decomposition with primary ideals Qi\nassociated to primes Pi , then gJ = J = \u2229i gQi for any g \u2208 G and this\naction must permute the Pi by the uniqueness of minimal primes. But\nsince G is connected, this permutation must be trivial.\nThe poset in Figure 2 shows that the minimal prime ideals that\ncontain I(X) are those corresponding to orbits 14, 15, and 150 . Let\nP14 , P15 and P150 denote the corresponding prime ideals. Then \u221awe\nmust have J \u2282 P14 \u2229 P15 \u2229 P150 . On the other hand, we know that J\nis prime and equals I(X). So a primary decomposition of J is of the\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n23\n\nform J = I(X) \u2229 Q14 \u2229 Q15 \u2229 Q15 , for some primary ideals Qi associated\nto the primes Pi . We will show that the multiplicity of each Qi with\nrespect to Pi is zero.\nIf we show this, we don't have to consider possible embedded components coming from the other orbits in the closure of X because these\nideals contain P14 , P15 and P150 . Moreover, since X and J have an\nS2 symmetry, if we show that the P15 does not occur in the primary\ndecomposition, then neither does P150 .\nWe will use a basic fact from commutative algebra. We found [BV88,\nTheorem 12.1] a useful formulation for understanding this type of test.\nProposition 8.2. [AM69, Proposition 4.7] Let a be a decomposable\nideal in a ring A, let a = \u2229ni\u22121 qi be a minimal primary decomposition\nand let pi be the prime ideal associated to the primary ideal qi . Then\n\u222ani=1 pi = {x \u2208 A | (a : x) 6= a}.\nIn particular, if the zero ideal is decomposable, the set D of zero-divisors\nof A is the union of the prime ideals belonging to 0.\nWe also have the following well-known fact (see for example [Eis99]).\nProposition 8.3. Let R = k[x0 , . . . xn ], let J be an ideal in R and\nsuppose f \u2208 R has degree d and is not a zero-divisor in R/J. Then we\nhave the following identity of Hilbert series:\n(1 \u2212 td )HR/J (t) = HR/(J+f ) (t).\nProof. This is completely standard, but we recall the proof here for\nthe reader's convenience and because it elucidates the ideas we will use\nlater.\nIf f is not a zero divisor, the following sequence is exact\n(1)\n\nf\n\n0\u2212\u2192(R/J)(\u2212d)\u2212\u2192R/J\u2212\u2192R/(J + f )\u2212\u21920.\n\nSince H(R/J)(\u2212d) (t) = td H(R/J) (t), the result follows from the additivity\nof Hilbert series.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.4. If f is actually a zero-divisor of R/J, then in some degree\nt0 , the graded version of the sequence (1) will have a kernel K larger\nthan expected. This will force the inequality in\nt0d H(R/J) (t0 ) = H(R/J)(\u2212d) (t0 ) < HK (t0 ).\nIn this case we will have\nt0d H(R/J) (t0 ) \u2212 HR/J (t0 ) < HK (t0 ) \u2212 HR/J (t0 ) = HR/(J+f ) (t0 ),\nwhich implies that\n(1 \u2212 t0d )HR/J (t0 ) < HR/(J+f ) (t0 ).\n\n\f24\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nThe previous results allow for the following test. Since the zerodivisors of J correspond to the union of prime ideals Pi that contain J,\nwe can select one f \u2208 Pi of degree d which vanishes on the subvariety\nV(Pi ) \u2282 V(J) but does not vanish on V(J). If we show that (1 \u2212\ntd )HR/J (t) = HR/(J+f ) (t), then f is not a zero-divisor of R/J. This\nwould show that Pi could not have been a prime ideal associated to J.\nWe provide the results of this computational test with the prime\nideals P15 and P14 . We wanted to check if a map had a kernel, so\nwe worked over characteristic 101. Non-vanishing modulo a prime p\nimplies non-vanishing in characteristic 0.\nIn Macaulay 2 we computed a Gr\u00f6bner basis of J = hM3 + M5 + M6 i\nin about 30 seconds.

The Poincare polynomial\nPf of R/(J + f ) is\nPf = 1 \u2212 11t3 \u2212 81t5 \u2212 1595t6 + 18117t7 \u2212 77436t8 + 194399t9\n\u2212 333909t10 + 428193t11 \u2212 436366t12 + 364230t13 \u2212 233793t14\n+ 68333t15 + 91800t16 \u2212 192213t17 + 203193t18 \u2212 147150t19\n+ 76356t20 \u2212 28023t21 + 6912t22 \u2212 1026t23 + 69t24 .\nNow it is easy to check that (1 \u2212 t3 )PJ = Pf , which implies\n(1 \u2212 t3 )HR/J (t) = HR/(J+f ) (t),\nand thus f is not a zero-divisor of R/J. The prime P15 is thus not an\nembedded prime of J. By the S2 symmetry of J, we conclude that\nP150 is also not an embedded prime of J.\n\n\fTHE IDEAL OF THE TRIFOCAL VARIETY\n\n25\n\nFor the prime ideal P14 , the module S22 S211 S211 vanishes on V(P14 )\nbut not on X.

The ideal J = hM3 + M5 + M6 i is prime.\n\u221a\nProof. By Proposition 7.4 we know that J = I(X). By Proposition\n5.2, we know that the degree of the top dimensional component of J is\n297, counted with multiplicity. By Computation 6.1, we know that the\ndegree of X is 297. So we know that in a primary decomposition of J,\nI(X) occurs with multiplicity 1. It only remains to rule out embedded\nprimes. By the above discussion, if we have a primary decomposition of\nthe form J = I(X) \u2229 Q14 \u2229 Q15 \u2229 Q150 , where the Qi are primary ideals\nassociated to the prime ideals Pi , then we showed that their multiplicity\nmust be zero. So J = I(X), and in particular J is prime.\n\u0003\n\n\f26\n\nCHRIS AHOLTA , LUKE OEDINGB\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.1. We conjecture that a\nsimilar calculation will work to show that the ideal of the orbit closure\nassociated to F is minimally generated by S3 .M3 .\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Bernd Sturmfels for suggesting this problem\nto us, along with some suggestions for a few of the computations.\nWe would also like to thank Jonathan Hauenstein for his expertise\nin Numerical Algebraic Geometry and Bertini, which provided an unquestionably useful component to our studies into the trifocal ideal.
