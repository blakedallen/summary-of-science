Results on NC geometry methods and brane systems of 10D\ntype-II superstrings [8, 9] have primarily been used. Starting from a two-dimensional system\nwith a large number N of electrons in the presence of a perpendicular strong magnetic field B,\nand considering fluctuations\n\u03b8\u03b5ij Aj (y)\n\n(1)\n\naround the time-independent background X i = y i , Susskind showed that the resulting effective\nfield theory is a NC U(1) Chern-Simons gauge theory with \u03b8 =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n\nand \u03c1 is the particle density.\n\nThe large U(N) automorphism symmetry of the Susskind matrix model,\nX \u2032 = UXU +\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n\f2 \u2032\n\nis mapped to an area-preserving diffeomorphism on the y plane, | \u2202\u2202yy2 | = 1, which in turns is\nmapped to a NC U(1) invariance in the space of gauge fluctuations,\nA\u2032i = U \u22c6 (Ai \u2212 \u2202i ) \u22c6 U\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u22c6 is the usual Moyal product.\nMoreover, by exploring the possibility to develop a consistent finite matrix model for the\ndescription of FQH droplet systems, interesting developments have been made by appropriately\ntreating the NC finite matrix model constraint equations. A first development in this direction\nwas made in [2] where a new field, denoted \u03a8 and transforming in the fundamental N of SU(N)\n(\u03a8\u0304 \u223c N\u0304), has been introduced to regularize the non-commutative plane constraint equation:\n[X 1 , X 2 ] = i\u03b8\n\n(4)\n\nfor the case of a finite number N of electrons. This equation is consistent only for infinite\nmatrices (N = \u221e), but with the help of the \u03a8 field, it can be made consistent even for finite\ndimensions as shown below\n\n+\n\u2212iB[X 1 , X 2 ]nm + \u03a8\u2212\nn \u03a8m = B\u03b8\u03b4nm\nP + \u2212\nn \u03a8n \u03a8n = NB\u03b8.\n\n(5)\n\nWith a non-zero \u03a8 field, the trace on the states is now well-defined and the initial constraint\nequations are turned to conditions for classical U(1)\u00d7SU(N) invariance with fixed U(1) charges\nas shown in the second of relations (5). There the X i 's are the usual (0 + 1)D Susskind\nmatrix field variables transforming as the adjoint of U(N); their N real eigenvalues may be\nthought of as just the two space coordinates of the N classical electrons. \u03a8 is an auxiliary\ncomplex scalar field in the fundamental representation of SU(N), ensuring consistency of the\nfinite N restriction. It can be viewed as the carrier of the boundary effects in the droplet\napproach and turns out to behave as the square root of the broken U(1) abelian subsymmetry\nof the original U(N) invariance of the Susskind matrix model. Together with the X i , the\nfields \u03a8 and \u03a8\u0304 may be viewed as following from a unique (N + 1) \u00d7 (N + 1) matrix field\n\nY i \u223c Adj(U(N + 1)) = Adj(U(N)) \u2295 N \u2295 N\u0304 \u2295 1 where Adj(U(N)) describes the X i fields\nwhile N and N\u0304 describe respectively \u03a8 and \u03a8\u0304. In the language of D-brane physics, where\n\nthe particles are viewed as D0-branes dissolved in the D2 world volume brane, the above \u03a8\nfield is represented by a F 1 string with an end on a D0-brane of D2 and the other end on a\n2\n\n\fD4-brane [10, 11, 5], see also [12, 13]. In section 4, we will explore other aspects of this field\nand introduce others in order to develop models for FQH states that are not of Laughlin type.\nQuantum mechanically, the X i hermitian matrix variables and the \u03a8 complex vector are\nmoreover interpreted as creation and annihilation (matrix) operators acting on the Hilbert\nspace H of states {|\u03a6 >}. In this case, (5) must be understood as constraint equations that\nshould be imposed on H. If one forgets for a while about the \u03a8 vector field and focus on the\n\u00b1\nX i 's by setting Z \u00b1 = (X 1 \u00b1 iX 2 ); then associate with each matrix field variable Znm\n, the 2N 2\n\nharmonic operators\n\nA\u00b1\nnm =\n\n\u221a\n\u00b1\nBZnm\n\n(6)\n\nobeying the usual Heisenberg algebra, except that now one has 2N 2 operators\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u2213\nAnm , A\u00b1\nkl = \u00b1\u03b4nk \u03b4ml\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u00b1\nAnm , A\u00b1\nkl = 0.\n\n(7)\n\nThen the classical constraint equation (5) should be replaced by\nJnm |\u03a6 >= 0\n\n(8)\n\nJ0 |\u03a6 >= Nk|\u03a6 > .\n\nIn these quantum constraints, the Jnm operators, which are expressed in terms of the 2N 2\n\u00b1\nharmonic oscillators A\u00b1\nnm and 2N harmonic \u03a8 ones as\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212 +\nJnm = A\u2212\nnk Akm \u2212 Ank Akm + \u03a8n \u03a8m\n\n(9)\n\ndefine just the usual SU(N) generators while\nJ0 =\n\nX\n\n\u2212\n\u03a8+\nn \u03a8n\n\n(10)\n\nn\n\nis the charge operator realizing the abelian U(1) subsymmetry factor of U(N). As such the\nquantum constraint equations (8) require the wavefunctions |\u03a6 > \u2208 H to be SU(N) invariant\nand moreover carry Nk charges of U(1); that are having Nk operators of type \u03a8+ or, equiva-\n\nlently, a monomial form (\u03a8+ )\n\nkN\n\n. In [3], see also [5], the solution for the constraint equations\n\n(5) have been obtained by using special properties of antisymmetric and holomorphic polynomials and the vacuum configuration has been shown to be similar to that obtained years ago\nby Laughlin [14].\nDespite the success of the Susskind NC model and its regularised version introduced by Polychronakos, in particular the theoretical prediction \u03b8 =\n3\n\n1\n2\u03c0\u03c1\n\nand the recovering of the Laughlin\n\n\fwavefunctions, several open questions remain which are not addressed by the Susskind approach. One of these questions concerns FQH states that are not of the Laughlin type. In fact\nthere are many FQH states, such as \u03bd = 23 , 52 , 73 , . . ., that have been observed experimentally [15]\nbut are not recovered by the Susskind model.\nAnother question, which has not been addressed even for the case of the Laughlin fluid,\nconcerns the singularities of the Laughlin wavefunctions \u03a6L (z1 , . . . , zN ) =< z1 , . . . , zN |\u03a6L i with\nfilling factor \u03bd = k1 . These wavefunctions\n\nN\nY\n\nBX\n\u03a6L (z1 , . . . , zN ) =\n(z\u03b1 \u2212 z\u03b2 ) exp \u2212\n|z\u03c3 |2\n4 \u03c3\n\u03b1<\u03b2=1\nk\n\nN(N\u22121)\n2\n\nhave a huge Zk N(N\u22121) discrete symmetry containing the special Zk\n2\n\n!\n\n(11)\n\nand ZkN(N\u22121) subsym2\n\nmetries and degenerate zeros of degree k. These zeros are expected to play a crucial role in the\nstudy of the quantum configuration of the NC system. Recall in passing that the degenerate\nzeros of \u03a6L cover remarkable features which may be exploited in the analysis of the quantum\nspectrum of the FQH system with fractional values for the filling factor. Indeed, setting\nu = \u03a6L (z1 , . . . , zN )\nQ\n\u2212k\nv\u03b1\u03b2 = N\nexp\n\u03b3<\u03b46=(\u03b1,\u03b2) (z\u03b3 \u2212 z\u03b4 )\n\nso their product can be written as\n\nB\n4\n\n2\n\u03c3 |z\u03c3 |\n\nP\n\nuv\u03b1\u03b2 = (z\u03b1 \u2212 z\u03b2 )k\n\n\u0001\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is nothing but the usual SU (k) singularity equation of the assymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) space [16, 17]. As such one expects that many results obtained in the context\nof representation theory for NC manifolds with singularities [18, 19] can be applied as well to\nthe FQH systems. From the NC geometry point of view, the above mentioned degeneracy of\n\u03a6L (z1 , . . . , zN ) should be lifted and one expects to get richer solutions for vacuum configurations\nin the NC plane that should contain the one recently built in [3].\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a matrix model for the FQH states at filling factor given\nby the series\n\u03bdk1 k2 =\n\nk1 + k2\nk1 k2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 odd integers and work out the vacuum configurations by taking into account the\nsingularities of the Laughlin wavefunctions and the NC geometry of the plane. To fix the ideas,\n4\n\n\fwe will mainly focus our attention on the FQH states at filling factor \u03bd = 52 . First, we reconsider\nthe Laughlin states with \u03bd =\n\n1\nk\n\nand study the effective link between discrete symmetries and\n\nthe NC geometry of the plane. We then look for the general solutions for vacuum wavefunctions\nby using techniques, borrowed from non-perturbative QCD concerning compositeness [20]. It\nis then possible to determine vacuum configurations for the wavefunctions as suggested by NC\ngeometry of the plane. This also allows us to propose a way of thinking about the electrons\nof FQH states as condensate states, formally similar to baryons of hadronic models of strong\ninteractions at low energies, and to the elementary excitations as the fundamental constituents\nanalogously to quarks in QCD. In brane language electrons are represented by D0-branes, while\nthe elementary excitations appear as fractional D0-branes. This quantum description recovers\nnot only the Susskind construction, but also the Hellerman and Van Raamsdonk solution for\nthe constraint equations (5), and of course the Laughlin wavefunctions with zeros of order k.\nWe then consider quantum configurations for states that are of non-Laughlin type by using,\non one hand, the developments made in the framework of Susskind's proposal and the subsequent results and, on the other hand, taking advantage from a special feature of the continuous\nfraction to interpret FQH states as a system of coupled Laughlin states. Recall that ideas\nutilizing coupled Laughlin states to describe states with general filling factors were successfully\nimplemented in the past when studying abelian hierarchies and effective Chern-Simons (CS)\ngauge models [21]. Such analyses were based on the action\nZ\n1\n1\nl\nd3 y \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 KIJ \u2202\u03bc AI\u03bd AJ\u03c1 .\nS[A , . . . , A ] =\n4\u03c0\n\n(15)\n\nIn the present description the world volume of the D2-brane, where the AI CS gauge fields\npropagate, have a fibration B \u00d7 F of a base given by the world volume of the D2-brane and as a\nfiber the vector space E generated by the {rI } vector basis system such that rI rJ = KIJ . In this\nbasis the hierarchical gauge field components AI appear just as projections on the vector basis,\n\nAIj = rI Aj . The KIJ matrix appearing in the above action functional is the well-known matrix\ntopological order describing hierarchies; for details on the possible classes of KIJ , see [21].\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we develop a microscopic analysis\nof the Hamiltonian description of the Laughlin states with filling factor \u03bd = k1 . We study the\nresolution of the SU (k) singularity by NC geometry and work out the resulting wavefunctions\ndescribing the vacuum configuration. In section 3, we study the FQH states that are not of\nLaughlin type and propose a way to approach such states by using the earlier Susskind results\nand ideas on fluid branches. In section 4, we consider a system of (N1 + N2 ) electrons and\n5\n\n\fdevelop a matrix model for FQH states with filling factor given by the series \u03bdk1 k2 . This system\ncontains two branches; a basic one with \u03bdk1 =\n\n1\nk1\n\nand another one with \u03bdk2 =\n\n1\nk2\n\nbuilt on the\n\ntop of the \u03bdk1 state. The coupling of the two branches is ensured by the introduction of an\neffective B \u2217 field and moreover through the use of a bosonic field in the bi-fundamental of the\nSU (N1 ) \u00d7 SU (N2 ) group. Such a field turns out not only to carry the interaction, but also to\nplay the role of a regulator without even requiring Polychronakos type fields.\n\n2\n\nMicroscopic description\n\nTo start recall that the Lagrangian L describing the dynamics of an electron of mass m and\ncharge (e = 1) moving in two dimensional space x = (x1 , x2 ) in the presence of a perpendicular\nexternal constant magnetic field B and a potential U(x), (U(x) = \u03ba2 x2 , with \u03ba is a coupling\nconstant) is\nL=\n\nm 2 B\n\u03ba\n\u1e8b + \u1e8b \u2227 x \u2212 x2 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nThe Hamiltonian\nH = \u03c0 \u1e8b \u2212 L\nof this electron is obtained as usual by computing the conjugate momenta \u03c0 =\n\n(17)\n\u2202L\n.\n\u2202 \u1e8b\n\nIn the\n\npresence of a strong enough magnetic field B, the quantum Hamiltonian H may be defined as\nH=\n+\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba\nZ\u0304Z+Z Z\u0304\n4\n\n(18)\n\nwhere now Z \u2261 Z \u2212 and Z\u0304 \u2261 Z are the Heisenberg operators associated to z and z\u0304. This one\nparticle energy operator may be viewed as describing the energy configurations of a harmonic\noscillator with a\u00b1 creation and annihilation operators:\n\u221a\na+ = B Z\u0304\n\u221a\na = BZ\n\n(19)\n\nsatisfying the usual commutation relations, namely\n[a\u2212 , a+ ] = 1\n[a\u00b1 , a\u00b1 ] = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nIn terms of these operators, (18) reads as\nH=\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0010 +\n2a a + 1\n2\n6\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 =\n\n\u03ba\nB\n\nand with ~ = 1 = c. For \u03ba large enough, say \u03ba =\n\nB2\n4\n\n+ \u03ba\u2032 , where \u03ba\u2032 is some\n\nperturbation parameter, the gap energy is large (E1 \u223c \u03ba \u223c B); and the dynamics of the quanta\nis mainly given by oscillations near the origin within the lowest Landau level (LLL).\n\nThough standard, the analysis we presented above yields some valuable information about\nthe discrete nature of the real plane, induced by the B field at the quantum level. Perhaps the\nmost important piece of information one obtains comes from the relation\n\u0002 \u2212 +\u0003\n1\nZ ,Z =\nB\n\n(22)\n\nwhich tells us that, from the semi-classic point of view, everything appears as if the (z, z\u0304) plane,\nz = x1 + ix2 , is quantized in fundamental B dependent areas (say small squares or discs),\nA0 =\n\n2\u03c0\n\u2261 l02\nB\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the magnetic length l0 appears in our notational convention as just the fundamental\nlength of the edges of the small square.\n\n2.1\n\n\u03bd=\n\n1\nk\n\nFQH states and discrete symmetries\n\nFrom the semi\u2013classic point of view, and due to the presence of the magnetic field B, the\nspace coordinate z\u03b1 , parameterizing an electron in the plane, should be thought of as a k \u00d7 k\n\nmatrix of the k\u2013dimensional representation D(Zk ) of the group Zk . The full NC plane is indeed\n\na kind of fibration B \u00d7 F whose base B is a plane with F as a fiber D(Zk ). This property\n\nis a well-known feature in constructing a NC geometry extension of manifolds with SU(k)\n\nsingularities [16, 17, 18, 19]. A quasi-similar situation happens here in the study of the vacuum\nconfigurations of FQH fluids from a non-commutative point of view. We will first describe the\ndiscrete symmetries of the Laughlin wavefunctions and then develop the basis of a NC analysis\nfor FQH fluids.\nSymmetries:\nTo exhibit the discrete symmetries of (11) more clearly, recall first that the Laughlin wavefunctions of filling factor \u03bd =\n\n1\nk\n\nis completely antisymmetric under the changes of any pair of\n\nelectrons of coordinates z\u03b1 and z\u03b2 , provided k is an odd integer, that is\n\u03a8L (z1,..., z\u03b1 , ..., z\u03b2 , ...zN ) = (\u2212)k \u03a8L (z1,...,z\u03b2 , ..., z\u03b1 , ...zN ) .\n\n7\n\n(24)\n\n\fThese wavefunctions also have a Zk N(N\u22121) manifest discrete invariance containing ZkN(N\u22121) and\n2\n\nN(N\u22121)\n2\n\n2\n\nas two special subsymmetries with a remarkable interpretation. These symmetries are\n\nZk\n\ndirectly seen in \u03a8L (z1 ...zN ) by requiring invariance under the change of variables\nz\u03b1\u2032 = \u03bbz\u03b1\n\n(25)\n\n\u2032\n\u03a8\u2032L = \u03a8L (z1\u2032 ...zN\n)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a complex (group) parameter and \u03b1 = 1, ..., N. The condition we get from the\nidentity \u03a8\u2032L = \u03a8L is the constraint equation on \u03bb:\n\u03bbk\n\nN(N\u22121)\n2\n\n= 1.\n\n(26)\n\nThis is a constraint relation which, in general, has several solutions describing different subgroups of the huge periodic symmetry Zk N(N\u22121) , parameterized by the fundamental root pa2\n\nrameter\nh\n\u03bb0 = exp i\n\ni\n4\u03c0\n.\nkN (N \u2212 1)\n\n(27)\n\nThe two particular solutions of (26) we here refer to above are those associated with the two\nspecial subsymmetries Z N(N\u22121) and Zk , respectively, generated by\n2\n\n\u03be = \u03bbk0 = exp i\n\n4\u03c0\nN (N \u2212 1)\n\n(28)\n\n2\u03c0\n).\nk\n\n(29)\n\nand\nN(N\u22121)\n2\n\n\u03b7 = \u03bb0\n\n= exp(i\n\nBefore proceeding we want to make two comments regarding these invariances. (i) First, the\ninteger\n\nkN (N \u22121)\n2\n\nappearing in (26) is just the total angular momentum of the Laughlin states; it\n\nis a positive integer multiple of k. From the expression of the Laughlin wavefunctions, which for\n(k=1)\n\nk = 1 reduces essentially to the Slater determinant detSlater \u2261 \u03a8L\n\n, one recognizes the Z N(N\u22121)\n2\n\ninvariance as just the symmetry of the integer quantum Hall (IQH) state. (ii) Concerning the\nZk subsymmetry of the Laughlin ground states, it is interesting to note that it has no analogue\nfor IQH states, as the latter are essentially described by the Slater determinant and reflects the\ndegeneracy property of the zeros of \u03a8L . This subsymmetry is then ineherent to the fractional\nfeature of the filling factor of ground states of the Hall system; it is expected to encode valuable\ninformation on Laughlin states with \u03bd = k1 . It is this aspect that we now continue to explore.\nDegenerate zeros:\n8\n\n\fA glance at the structure of the Laughlin wavefunctions lets one discover that fractionality of\nthe electric charge and the spin of the quasiparticles which one encounters in the framework of\nthe Chern-Simons effective field model, is associated with the degenerate zeros of \u03a8L ; i.e.\n\u03a8L \u223c\n\nN\nY\n\n\u03b1<\u03b2\n\n(z\u03b1 \u2212 z\u03b2 )k .\n\n(30)\n\nThis behaviour of \u03a8L , which is very familiar in the physics of quantum systems living on\norbifolds, resembles a similar situation that one has in singularity theory, especially the SU (k)\nsingularity of the ALE space. To explore the idea, let us, for simplicity of the analysis, set for\na moment N = 2 so that \u03a8L \u2261 \u03a8 reduces to the monomial\n\u03a8 \u223c (z1 \u2212 z2 )k .\n\n(31)\n\n) and \u03b7 k = 1, as described above, we have\nUnder the special Zk symmetry, with \u03b7 = exp(i 2\u03c0\nk\n(z1\u2032 \u2212 z2\u2032 ) = \u03b7 (z1 \u2212 z2 )\n\n\u03a8\u2032 = \u03a8.\n\n(32)\n\nNow, expressing \u03a8 as\nu\ny\nwith the following properties under Zk symmetry\n\u03a8=\n\n(33)\n\nu\u2032 = \u03bbu\ny \u2032 = \u03bby\nu\u2032\ny\u2032\n\n=\n\n(34)\n\nu\ny\n\nand substituting in (31), we get, by renaming v = y \u22121, the well-known equation of the ALE\nspace with an ordinary SU (k) singularity, namely\nuv = (z1 \u2212 z2 )k .\n\n(35)\n\nOf course this relation can be obtained from (13) by fixing y = 1 and N = 2. Therefore for\ngeneric values of N, it extends straightforwardly and is basically as in (13). Zk invariance\nreflects then the fact that the Laughlin wavefunctions have zeros with order of degeneracy k.\nThis is the algebraic way in which the information about the fractionality of the filling factor\n\u03bd =\n\n1\nk\n\nis encoded. Since we are interested precisely in this behaviour of the quantum Hall\n\nsystem, let us extend this treatment by looking for solutions of the transformations\nz\u03b1\u2032 = P\u03b7 z\u03b1 P\u22121\n\u03b7\n9\n\n(36)\n\n\fand\nP \u03b7 \u03a8L = \u03a8L P \u03b7\n\n(37)\n\nz\u03b1\u2032 = \u03b7\u03b1 z\u03b1\n\n(38)\n\nP z\u03b1 = \u03b7\u03b1 z\u03b1 P\n\n(39)\n\nor simply\n\nwhich can also be written as\n\nwhere we have denoted the Zk generator P\u03b7 simply as P. Our idea of considering the above\nrelation as an additional constraint equation is borrowed from the analysis developed in the\ncontext of a resolution of stringy singularities through non-commutative geometry and discrete\ntorsion. In this approach, originally due to Berenstein and Leigh, P is no longer seen as the\ngenerator of an external automorphism Zk symmetry, as we have been doing until now, but as\ngenerating inner automorphisms. For more details on this issue see [17, 18, 19]. For present\npurposes we only need to note that the z\u03b1 variables of (39) may be solved using fiber bundle\ntechniques with the plane as base and the k-dimensional representation of Zk as the fiber. The\ntrivial realization of z\u03b1 is given by the tensor product z\u03b1 = w\u03b1 \u2297 Q, where the w\u03b1 's are the\neffective complex plane coordinates of the electrons and where Q is the generator of the internal\n\nstructure which, together with P, are realized as\nP=\n\nPk\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b7 j\u22121 \u03a0j\n\nP k = Ik\nP\nQ = kj=1 fj\n\n(40)\n\nQk = Ik .\nIn these relations\n\n\u03a0j = |j >< j|\n\n(41)\n\nis the projector on the j-th state of the vector basis B \u2261 {|j >; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k} of the D(Zk )\nrepresentation,\n\nfj = |j + 1 >< j|\n\n(42)\n\nis a translation operator and Ik is the usual identity matrix. The k \u00d7 k matrix Q is then a\n\ntranslation operator rotating the elements of the B basis and acting as fj . The matrix P, which\n\nis diagonal, may also be written as\n\nP = exp(i\n10\n\n2\u03c0L0\n)\nk\n\n(43)\n\n\fwhere L0 is the hermitian operator counting the Zk charges, that is, acting as\nL0 |ji = j|ji\n\n(44)\n\nP|ji = \u03b7 j |ji.\n\n(45)\n\nso that\n\nStraightforward calculations show moreover that P and Q satisfy\nPQ = \u03b7 QP.\n\n(46)\n\nAt the quantum level, the solution z\u03b1\u00b1 = w\u03b1\u00b1 \u2297 Q\u00b1\n\u03b1 for the non-commutative point should be\n\nnaturally replaced by\n\nZ\u03b1\u00b1 = W\u03b1\u00b1 \u2297 Q\u00b1\n\u03b1.\n\n(47)\n\nFor the special case k = 1, there is no singularity and the Z\u03b1\u00b1 position operators reduce to the\ncomplex plane operators; i.e. Z\u03b1\u00b1 = W\u03b1\u00b1 , and so one is left with a system of IQH states at filling\n\u221a\nB Z\u03b1\u00b1 may be thought\nfactor \u03bd = 1. In this case the creation and annihilation operators a\u00b1\n\u03b1 =\nof as the operators associated with IQH states. For later use we shall refer to the a\u00b1\n\u03b1 with k = 1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nas c\u00b1\n\u03b1 ; i.e. (a\u03b1 )k=1 = c\u03b1 and keep the notation a\u03b1 for creation and annihilation operators in\n\nthe NC plane. For the generic case k \u2265 2, the filling factor is no longer integer and the creation\n\nand annihilation operators carry an internal structure induced by the Zk symmetry as shown\n\non a\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 . The extra index i\u03b1 refers effectively to this internal feature and its realization may\nbe made more explicit in the trivial representation with the aid of the fj step operators on the\ninternal space, introduced earlier as\n\u00b1\na\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 = c\u03b1 \u2297 fi\u03b1 .\n\n(48)\n\nTaking the sum over all states of the internal space, namely\nk\nX\n\ni\u03b1 =1\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\na\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 = c\u03b1 \u2297 Q\n\n(49)\n\nwhich we set as a\u00b1\n\u03b1 for simplicity, one sees that the above operators exhibit a set of special\nfeatures, the main ones being: (i) (48) reflects a well-known property in brane physics in the\npresence of a B field, namely the fractionating of D-branes at singularities. As such creation and\nannihilation operators a\u00b1\n\u03b1 of the electron ( D0-brane) fractionate in terms of more fundamental\n\u00b1\noperators a\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 = Tr(fi\u03b1 +1 a\u03b1 ) (fractional D0-branes). This means that in the same manner that\n\n11\n\n\fthe electrons are described by D0-branes in the brane picture, the a\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 are associated with\nfractional D0-branes (fractional electrons or, again, quasi-electrons).

Another Zk invariant composite operator is given by the trace\nTr(A+\n\u03b1 )(j) ; this operator does not depend on the {|j >} basis vectors and as we show later,\nthis is the operator that has been used in [3] to construct the wavefunction. To build the\n\ngeneric eigenstates |\u03a6i = |{n\u03b1,i\u03b1 }i of the Hamiltonian H, one proceeds as usual by acting by\nmonomials in the creation operators on the vacuum. This is a standard analysis which we will\n\nskip and come directly to the study of the case of a FQH system of N particles with filling\nfactor \u03bd = k1 . To get the fundamental state of this system of N particles, one should solve the\n13\n\n\ffollowing constraint equations\nH|n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i(1\u2264\u03b1\u2264N ) = E |n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i(1\u2264\u03b1\u2264N )\n\n\u0001\nk\ni\u03b1 \u22121\nP|n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i(1\u2264\u03b1\u2264N ) = \u03a0N\n|n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i(1\u2264\u03b1\u2264N )\n\u03b1=1 \u03a0i\u03b1 =1 \u03b7\u03b1\n\n(63)\n\n\u0001\ni\u03b1 \u22121\nk\nshould be equal to the unity in order\nwhere E is the energy spectrum and \u03a0N\n\u03b1=1 \u03a0i\u03b1 =1 \u03b7\u03b1\nto ensure Zk invariance. To do so, let us first recall some useful features for our computation.\n\nSince for a fixed particle \u03b1, the Zk symmetry still commutes with the one electron Hamiltonian\nH\u03b1 ; i.e.\n\nH\u03b1 P = P H\u03b1\n\n(64)\n\nthe one particle vacuum state is also degenerate |v\u03b1 >\u2261 {|\u03b1, i\u03b1 >, i\u03b1 = 1, * * * , k}. It is a\nk-dimensional vector with the following properties:\n\nQ|\u03b1, i\u03b1 >= |\u03b1, i\u03b1 + 1 >\nP|\u03b1, i\u03b1 >= \u03b7\u03b1i\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >\n\n(65)\n\nwith \u03b7\u03b1k = 1, and\n\u00b1\na\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >= c\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 + 1 >\n\nc+\n\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >= 0\n\nH\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >=\n\n\u03c9\n2\n\n(66)\n\n|\u03b1, i\u03b1 > .\n\nMoreover it is completely reducible, that is |v\u03b1 > = \u2295ki\u03b1 =1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >, and so one has k identical\n\ncopies rotated among each others by the Q operator. Furthermore as the energy spectrum of\n\nthe H\u03b1 operator is\nEn\u03b1,i\u03b1\nthe excited states |n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i of H\u03b1 satisfying\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0010\n2n\u03b1,i\u03b1 + 1\n=\n2\n\nH\u03b1 |n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i =\nare given by\n|n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i =\nOn the other hand, since\n\ns\n\n(67)\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0010\n2n\u03b1,i\u03b1 + 1 |n\u03b1,i\u03b1 i\n2\n1\n\n(n\u03b1,i\u03b1 )!\n\n\u0010\n\na+\n\u03b1i\u03b1\n\n\u0011n\u03b1,i\u03b1\n\nL0 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >= i\u03b1 |\u03b1, i\u03b1 >\n\n|\u03b1, i\u03b1i.\n\n(68)\n\n(69)\n\n(70)\n\nit follows from covariance under the Zk symmetry that the n\u03b1,i\u03b1 integers should be such that\nn\u03b1,i\u03b1 = k p\u03b1 + i\u03b1\n14\n\n(71)\n\n\fwhere p\u03b1 is a positive integer. As a first result, if one considers the particular case where\ni\u03b1 = 1 for all \u03b1, that is, for the Zk invariant vacuum |vi = |0, 1 >, then the composite following\nfrom (62) is\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nA+\n\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\n+\n+\n= a+\n\u03b1,k a\u03b1,k\u22121 . . . a\u03b1,1 .\n\n(72)\n\nThis is the creation operator of the one electron state\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2212\n|e\u03b1 i\n\n(1)\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n= A+\n|0, 1 >\n\u03b1\n(1)\n\n(73)\n\nwith energy\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0010\n2k + 1\n2\n\n(74)\n\nand position z\u03b1 . More generally using (61), one can build k similar one electron states\n\u0010\n\n|e\u2212\n\u03b1i\n\n\u0011\n\n(j)\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n= A+\n|vi = |0 > \u2297|j >\n\u03b1\n(j)\n\n(75)\n\nwith the same quantum numbers, by using the |0 > \u2297|j >\u2261 |0, j > vacua.\n\u0010\n\nA careful inspection of (62) reveals that because of the identities (61), the expression of\n\u0011\nA+\nis in fact SU(k) invariant. The point is that out of the a\u00b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 operators, one can\n(j)\n\nconstruct the following SU(k) invariant condensate\n\ni1 ...ik \u00b1\nA\u00b1\na\u03b1i1 . . . a\u00b1\n\u03b1 = \u03b5\n\u03b1ik\n\n(76)\n\nwhere \u03b5i1 ...ik is the usual completely antisymmetric k-dimensional invariant tensor. Due to the\nrelations (61) only the cyclic k-terms of the expansion are non-zero. The terms that survive,\nafter using (61), depend on the basis vector on which A\u00b1\n\u03b1 acts. Using the notation\n\u00b1\nA\u00b1\n\u03b1j =< j|A\u03b1 |j >\n\n(77)\n\none can rewrite the above relation as\nA\u00b1\n\u03b1 =\n\nk\nX\n\nA+\n\u03b1j \u03c0j\n\n(78)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the \u03c0j 's are the projectors on the states |ji introduced earlier. This decomposition in\nterms of projectors reflects the property of the resolution of the singularity by NC geometry.\n\nEach component may be used to a build solution of the constraint equations (8). But before\npresenting these solutions, let us make the contact with the result of [3]. Though the authors\n\n15\n\n\fof that work have not addressed the question of the resolution of singularity by NC geometry,\none can still recover their wavefunction by considering the special invariant operator\nTrA+\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\nk\nX\nj=1\n\n< j|A+\n\u03b1 |j > .\n\n(79)\n\nWith the aid of this operator and the realization (48), one can check that the following wavefunction coincides with that derived in [3]\n|\u03a6v\u03bd=1/k i\n\n= N\u03b5\n\n\u03b11 ...\u03b1N\n\n\u00112\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011N\n+\n+\n+\nTrA\u03b11 TrA\u03b12 . . .

This is a remarkable result which should be understood as a consequence\nof NC geometry which acts by lifting SU(k) singularity of the Laughlin wavefunctions. In\n\u0011n\n\u0010\noperator may be interpreted as the operator of creation of an\nthe above relation, the A+\n\u03b1n\n\nelectron at the position z\u03b1n with an energy kn in the units of the frequency.

We will turn to this behaviour in\nsection 4 when we study FQH states that are not of the Laughlin type.\nWe end this subsection by noting that the wavefunctions associated with (80,81) may be\nderived from the \"non-commutative\" extension of the Laughlin wavefunctions (11). Replacing\nthe lower case (commutative) z\u03b1 variables by their non-commutative analogues Z\u03b1 , one gets\nthe following generalized wavefunctions\n\u0010\n\nC\n\u03a8N\n= \u03a0N\nL\n\u03b1<\u03b2=1 Z\u03b1 \u2212 Z\u03b2\n\n\u0011k\n\n!\nN\nBX\nZ \u03c1Z +\n.\nexp \u2212\n\u03c1\n4 \u03c1=1\n\n(85)\n\nNow using the realization Z\u03b1 = W\u03b1 \u2297 Q, as well as the algebraic relations Qk = I and Q\u2020 =\n\u0010\n\u0011k\nQk\u22121 , one sees that the monomials Z\u03b1 \u2212 Z\u03b2\nand the quadratic objects Z \u03c1 Z +\n\u03c1 are in the\n\ncentre of the D (Zk ) representation; that is\n\n\u0011k \u0010\n\u0011k\n\u0010\nZ\u03b1 \u2212 Z\u03b2 = W\u03b1 \u2212 W\u03b2 \u2297 I\n\n(86)\n\nZ\u03c1 Z\u03c1+ = W\u03c1 W\u0304\u03c1 \u2297 I\n\n(87)\n\nand\n\nare proportional to the identity.

In this formulation, the N classical particles are roughly speaking described by\n\nthe Z\u03b1\u03b1 diagonal entries of a N \u00d7 N matrix Z while their \"mutual interactions\" are carried\n\nby the non-diagonal terms Z\u03b1\u03b2 , \u03b1 6= \u03b2. The corresponding creation and annihilation operators\na\u00b1\n\u03b1\u03b2 of the quantum system are valued in Adj(U (N)), contrary to the previous study where\n\nthey were in the N and N\u0304 representations. We will give here below a correspondence rule\n17\n\n\fFigure 1: The vertices of this polygon represents the k Laughlin wavefunctions (here we have taken\na pentagon with k = 5 vertices). The dots are associated with the k characters of Zk and are rotated\nunder Q automorphisms as shown on the figure. The factorisation of the Zk invariance implies the\nshrinking of the k vertices down to j = k and as a consequence one recovers the usual degenerate\nexpression obtained in [3].\n\n18\n\n\fallowing one to obtain the spectrum of the matrix model just from the results of the analysis\nof subsection (2.1). This derivation allows us to discover another remarkable property of the\nPolychronachos field operator and shows that this field operator is just the leading one of a\nmore general situation to be considered in section 4.\nFor a system with a finite number N of electrons, the action of the matrix model reads, in\nterms of the Z and Z\u0304 dynamical variables, as\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 i\nk\nk\n\u2020\ndt Tr iZ\u0304DZ \u2212 \u03c9Z Z\u0304 +\ndt \u03a8 D\u03a8 +\ndt TrA + hc.\nS=\n4\u03b8\n2\n2\n\n(89)\n\nThe matrix variables involved in this Lagrange description are: (i) A complex (0+1)D field Z(t)\nconsisting of two hermitian N \u00d7 N matrix fields: Xij1 and Xij2 transforming in the U(N) adjoint\n\nrepresentation N \u2297 N\u0304.

In fact due to the factorisation (48), the A+\n\u03b1 and E\u03b1 are proportional and then we will\n\nuse the A+\n\u03b1 objects.\nOne can also deduce the Hamiltonian H associated with the matrix model by using (60).\n\u03b2j\n\nIt reads in terms of the (a\u00b1 )\u03b1i\u03b1\u03b2 's as\n\nH=\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0010\n2Nb + N 2\n2\n\n(104)\n\n\u1fb1\n\nwhere Nb is the number operator counting (b\u00b1 )\u03b1 .

The\n\nwavefunctions can also be worked out immediately from (82); all one has to do is to replace\nthe A+\n\u03b1 operators of (82) by the expressions (93,96).\nThe above relations may also be derived by following the standard approach.

The point is that from the standard definition of the filling factor\n22\n\n\f\u03bd =\n\nN\n,\nN\u03c6\n\nthe state \u03bd =\n\n2\n5\n\ncan naively be thought of as corresponding to \u03bd =\n\nN\nN\u03c6\n\nwhere the\n\nnumber N\u03c6 of flux quanta is given by a fractional amount of the electron number; that is\n1\nN\u03c6 = (3 \u2212 )N.\n2\n\n(112)\n\nIn fact this way of viewing things reflects just the original idea of the hierarchical construction of\nFQH states of general filling factor pq , considered years ago by many FQH authors. In Haldane's\nhierarchy [22] construction, for instance, the KIJ matrix of (15) is taken as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\np \u22121\n\uf8ec 1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u22121 p2 \u22121\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u22121 . .\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nKIJ = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n. . \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u22121 pn\n\nwith p1 an odd integer and the others pi 's even. The filling factor is given by the continuous\nfraction\n\u03bdp1 ...pn =\n\n1\n1 .\np1 \u2212 p2\u2212...\n\n(113)\n\nFor the level two of the hierarchy (n = 2), the elements of the series\n\u03bdp1 p2 =\n\np2\np1 p2 \u2212 1\n\n(114)\n\ncorrespond to taking N\u03c6 as given by a specific rational factor of the electron number; i.e.\nN\u03c6 = (p1 \u2212\n\n1\n)N.\np2\n\n(115)\n\nUpon setting\nk 1 = p1\n\n(116)\n\nk2 = k1 (k1 p2 \u2212 1)\nthe rational factor\n\np1 p2 \u22121\np2\n\ncan be brought into the following suggestive form\n\nk1 k2\n,\nk1 +k2\n\nand so the\n\nfilling factor \u03bdp1 p2 \u2261 \u03bdk1 k2 splits as\n\u03bdk1 k2 =\n\n1\n1\n+ ,\nk1 k2\n\n(117)\n\nk2 > k1 .\n\nTherefore FQH states with \u03bdk1 k2 may, under some conditions, be thought of as consisting of\ntwo coupled Laughlin states of filling factors \u03bdk1 =\n23\n\n1\nk1\n\nand \u03bdk2 =\n\n1\nk2\n\nrespectively. The choice\n\n\fof p1 an odd integer and p2 even ensures automatically that both k1 and k2 are odd integers,\nand so both of the \u03bdki =\n\n1\nki\n\n(i = 1, 2) FQH branches describe fermions. This feature, which is\n\nvalid for any level n of the Haldane hierarchy, reads, for the special \u03bd =\n\n2\n5\n\nexample we will be\n\nconsidering to illustrate our results, as\n\u03bd=\n\n1\n1\n2\n\u2261 + .\n5\n3 15\n\n(118)\n\nTo study vacuum configurations of such FQH states, it is interesting to fix some terminology\nand specify the hypothesis we will be using. As far as terminology and notational convention are\nconcerned, let N1 (resp. N\u03c61 ) be the number of electrons (resp. quantum flux) in the \u03bdk1 =\n\n1\nk1\n\nFQH fundamental state and N2 (resp. N\u03c62 ) be the number of electrons (resp. quantum flux)\nin \u03bd2 =\n\n1\n.\nk2\n\nFrom the relation \u03bdki =\n\n1\n,\nki\n\nwe have the identities N\u03c6i = ki Ni . Let also B \u2261 B1 be\n\nthe external magnetic field viewed by the N1 electrons of the \u03bdk1 FQH fundamental state and\nB \u2217 \u2261 B2 be the effective magnetic field felt by the N2 electrons of the \u03bdk2 hierarchical state.\nThe relation between the B and B \u2217 fields is\n\nk2\nB2\n=\n\u2261 (k1 p2 \u2212 1) .\nB1\nk1\n\n(119)\n\n2\n5\n\nstate, we have the relation B2 = 5B1 . A way to derive this result is to use\n\b\nthe following semi-classical analysis. First denote by Z1,\u03b1 , Z\u03041,\u03b1 ; 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 N1 the quantum\n\b\ncoordinate operators associated with the \u03bdk1 = k11 state and by Z2,a , Z\u03042,a ; 1 \u2264 a \u2264 N2 those\nFor the \u03bd =\n\nassociated with the \u03bdk2 =\n\n1\nk2\n\nstate. The dynamics of these two sets of matrix variables is given\n\nby actions of type (89). Then use the following quantum constraint equations by treating for\nthe moment the two Laughlin states \u03bdk1 and \u03bdk2 as independent:\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\nZ1,\u03b1 , Z\u03041,\u03b2 = i\u03b81 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ2,a , Z\u03042,b = i\u03b82 \u03b4ab\n\n(120)\n\nwhere, according to the result of Susskind, the \u03b8j parameters in the large N limits are given by\n\u03b8j = const\n\nkj\n.\nBj\n\n(121)\n\nSince \u03b8j is interpreted as the effective size occupied by an electron in the quantum space R2\u03b8 , it\nfollows from the indiscernability hypothesis that \u03b81 = \u03b82 and consequently\nk1\nk2\n=\n.\nB1\nB2\n24\n\n(122)\n\n\fSetting Bi = li\u22122 where l1 and l2 are the so-called magnetic lengths associated to B1 and B2\nrespectively, the previous relation then reads as\nki li2 = const.\n\n(123)\n\nAs we are dealing with N = (N1 + N2 ) electrons coming from two origins and since k2 > k1 , it is\nhelpful to introduce the following useful terminology. Thus we will refer to the elementary flux\n\u03c61 occupying the area A1 \u223c\nfluxes \u03c62 , of size A2 \u223c\n\n1\nB2\n\n=\n\n1\nB1\nl22 ,\n\n= l12 in the \u03bdk1 state as quasi-electrons and to those elementary\nin the \u03bdk2 state as quasi-muons4 . This terminology should not\n\nbe confused with various ones used in condensed matter physics literature. In our case, all that\nthis appellation means is that when k1 quasi-electrons (resp. k2 quasi-muons) condensate, they\ngive rise to one real electron (resp. one muon by extension).\nUsing the results of section 2, one can first write down the fundamental wavefunctions\n|\u03a61 , vk1 i \u2297 |\u03a62 , vk2 i for the uncoupled system; that is for the situation where each of the filling\nfactors \u03bdk1 and \u03bdk2 are treated separately. This is the case for instance of two FQH layers\n\ndistant enough so that they cannot feel each other. However, this is not the case here. The\nsystem in the present study consists of one layer only and the \u03bdk1 and \u03bdk2 states should be\n+\ncoupled. If we denote by a+\n\u03b1i\u03b1 the creation operators of quasi-electrons (resp. daia the creation\n\noperators of quasi-muons) and by A+\n\u03b1 the creation operators of one electron with energy k1 in\n\u03c91 units and k1 charges of U (1) (76,78) (resp. Da+ the creation operator of muons with energy\nk2 in \u03c92 units and k2 charges of U \u2032 (1) (76,78)), then the wavefunction |\u03a6v12 i describing the\n\nvacuum configuration of N = (N1 + N2 ) particles is (with the hypothesis N1 = rN2 , r > 1, as\nis usually the case for the level two of the Haldane hierarchy)\n|\u03a6v12 i = \u03b5I1 ...Ir [A+ ]I1 [A+ (D + )1 ]I2 . . .

We will focus our attention on the e \u2212 \u03bc system we presented above although\nmost of our results may be extended to more general FQH systems.\n\n4\n\nMatrix model for (e \u2212 \u03bc) system\n\nWe start by presenting the variables of the matrix model for the case of a FQH droplet of\nN = (N1 + N2 ) electrons (N1 electrons and N2 muons) with filling factor \u03bdk1 k2 . The integers\nk1 and k2 are some specific odd integers; they are essentially given by the family of integers,\nk1 = p1 and k2 = p1 (p1 p2 \u2212 1) with p1 odd and p2 even, appearing in the second level of the\n\nHaldane hierarchy. One of the key ideas of our description is to think about these states as\nconsisting of two coupled branches of filling fractors \u03bdk1 =\n\n1\nk1\n\nand \u03bdk2 =\n\n1\n.\nk2\n\nThe second FQH\n\nstate with N2 muons is built on top of the \u03bdk1 state; that is it comes after the condensation\nof the N1 electrons of the \u03bdk1 state, viewed, by the way, as the level one of the hierarchy.\n27\n\n\fThe matrix fields involved in our model are of three kinds: the first fields, which describe the\nset of N1 electrons in the presence of the external magnetic field B, are associated with the\ne\u2013sector, the second type of fields describe the \u03bc\u2013sector and the third type of fields carry the\n(e \u2212 \u03bc)\u2013couplings.\n\n4.1\n\ne\u2013Sector\n\nThe matrix variables associated with the e\u2013sector of the (e\u2212\u03bc) system are supposed to describe\nthe \u03bdk1 =\n\n1\nk1\n\nbranch of the fluid. They are given by the usual triplet (Z1 , \u03a81 , A1 ) appearing in\n\nthe Susskind-Polychronakos matrix model and have the following U(N1 ) group structure\nZ1 = (Z1 )\u1fb1\u03b1 \u223c N1 \u2297 N\u03041\n\nZ\u03041 = (Z\u03041 )\u03b1\u1fb1 \u223c N\u03041 \u2297 N1\n\u03a81 = (\u03a81 )\u03b1 \u223c N1\n\n(141)\n\n\u03a8\u03041 = (\u03a8\u03041 )\u1fb1 \u223c N\u03041\n\nA1 = (A1 )\u1fb1\u03b1 \u223c N1 \u2297 N\u03041 .\nThe matrix model describing the dynamics of these fields is given by the following one-dimensional\nU(N1 ) gauge invariant action\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 i\nk1\nk1\ndt Tr iZ\u03041 DZ1 \u2212 \u03c91 Z\u03041 Z1 +\ndt \u03a8\u03041 D\u03a81 +\ndt TrA1 + hc\nS1 =\n4\u03b81\n2\n2\n\n(142)\n\nwhile the constraint equations, which are obtained as usual by computing the equation of\nmotion of A1 , read as\n[Z1 , Z\u03041 ]\u1fb1\u03b1 +\n\n1\n\u03b81\n\u03a8\u03b1 \u03a8\u0304\u1fb1 = \u03b81 \u03b4\u03b1\u1fb1 .\n2k1\n2\n\n(143)\n\nQuantum mechanically, these constraint equations should be imposed on the Hilbert space H\nof the wavefunctions |\u03a6i and so (143) should be thought of as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J0\n\n(1)\n\nJ\u03b1\u1fb1 |\u03a6i = 0\n\u0010\n(1)\nJ0 |\u03a6i = k1 N1 =\n\nN1\n\u03bd1\n\n\u0011\n\n|\u03a6i\n\n(144)\n\nand J\u03b1\u1fb1 are the generators of the U(N1 ) = U(1) \u00d7 SU(N1 ) gauge symmetry of the\n\naction S1 . Later on we will give the field realization of these charge operators; but for the\n\nmoment let us complete the presentation of the dynamical variables of the (e \u2212 \u03bc) system.\n\n28\n\n\f4.2\n\n\u03bc\u2013Sector\n\nThe matrix field variables associated with the subsystem \u03bc containing N2 electrons (muons) are\nquite similar to those appearing in the e\u2013sector. These variables, which describe the \u03bdk2 branch\nof the \u03bdk1 k2 fluid, are given by the triplet (Z2 , \u03a82 , A2 ) valued in U(N2 ) group representations as\nshown below\nZ2 = (Z2 )\u0101a \u223c N2 \u2297 N\u03042\nZ\u03042 = (Z\u03042 )a\u0101 \u223c N\u03042 \u2297 N2\n\n\u03a82 = (\u03a82 )a \u223c N2\n\n(145)\n\n\u03a8\u03042 = (\u03a8\u03042 )\u0101 \u223c N\u03042\n\nA2 = (A2 )\u0101a \u223c N2 \u2297 N\u03042 .\n\nThe action S2 of the matrix model for this sector reads as\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 i\nk2\nk2\ndt Tr iZ\u03042 DZ2 \u2212 \u03c92 Z2 Z\u03042 +\ndt \u03a8\u03042 D\u03a82 +\ndt TrA2 + hc.\nS2 =\n4\u03b82\n2\n2\n\n(146)\n\nThe constraint equations are naturally given by\n[Z2 , Z\u03042 ]\u0101a +\n\n1\n\u03b82\n\u03a8a \u03a8\u0304\u0101 = \u03b82 \u03b4a\u0101 .\n2k2\n2\n\n(147)\n\nAt the quantum level, they should be thought of as\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere now J0\n\nthe action S2 .\n\n(2)\n\nJa\u0101 |\u03a6i = 0\n\u0010\n(2)\nJ0 |\u03a6i = k2 N2 =\n\nN2\n\u03bd2\n\n\u0011\n\n|\u03a6i\n\n(148)\n\nand Ja\u0101 are the generators of the U(N2 ) = U(1) \u00d7 SU(N2 ) gauge symmetry of\n\nNote that as far as these two pieces of the total action S = (S1 + S2 + Sint ) of the (e \u2212 \u03bc)\n\nsystem are concerned, the full gauge symmetry is U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ).

As\nsuch electrons of the \u03bc\u2013sector view a total magnetic field\nB \u2217 = B2 = B1 + \u2206B.\nFrom previous analysis, see (122,123), one learns that B2 =\n\n(151)\nk2\nB.\nk1 1\n\nThe latter relation is based\n\non the identity \u03b81 = \u03b82 \u2261 \u03b8.\n\nFor the distribution of the D0-branes of the \u03bdk1 k2 FQH states, we suppose that the constraint\n(i)\n\nequations J0 |\u03a6i = Ni \u03bdk\u22121\n|\u03a6i established for the Laughlin states are general ones and so we\ni\ndemand that such a condition is also valid for FQH states that are not of the Laughlin type.\n\nPut differently, we will suppose that the total number of the fractional D0-branes in the vacuum\nconfiguration |\u03a6i of the \u03bdk1 k2 FQH states is given by J0 |\u03a6i =\n\nN\n|\u03a6i;\n\u03bd\n\ni.e\n\nk1 k2\nN|\u03a6i\nk1 + k2\nwhere the J0 charge operator is the full charge operator to be given later.\nJ0 |\u03a6i =\n\n(152)\n\nThe third contribution to interactions between the two branches of the (e \u2212 \u03bc) fluid comes\n\nfrom the requirement that the e and \u03bc couplings are U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ) gauge invariant. From\nthe U(N1 ) \u00d7 U(N2 ) group representation analysis (141) and (145), one sees that the candidate\nfields to carry such interactions behave as\n\n\u03a8\u03b1a \u223c (N1 , N2)\n\n\u03a8\u0304\u1fb1\u0101 \u223c (N\u03041 , N\u03042)\n\u03a8\u0101\u03b1 \u223c (N1 , N\u03042 )\n\n(153)\n\n\u03a8\u0304\u1fb1a \u223c (N\u03041 , N2 ).\n\nTherefore, there are two kinds of rectangular complex matrices \u03a8\u03b1a and \u03a8\u0101\u03b1 together with their\ncomplex conjugates. They look like the Polychronakos field, but in fact they are more general\nobjects with very remarkable features. To get more insight in the role played by these fields,\nlet us focus our attention on one of these fields, say the \u03a8\u03b1a and its conjugate \u03a8\u0304\u1fb1\u0101 .

Indeed, due\nto non-commutative geometry, the SU (k1 ) and SU (k2 ) singularities of the Laughlin wavefunctions of the e and \u03bc sectors are removed and therefore the classical \u03a8 field in the bioperators transfundamental (153) should be replaced, at the quantum level, by the \u03a8\u00b1\n\u03b1i\u03b1 ,aja \u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\nforming in the (N1 , k1 ) \u2297 (N2 , k2 ) representation of the SU (N1 ) \u00d7 SU (k1 ) \u2297 SU (N2 ) \u00d7\n\u0011\n\u0010\nSU (k2 ) group.

In this case, one needs a building block\nstructure using invariants of SU (k1 ) \u00d7 SU (k2 ) \u00d7 SU (N1 ) \u00d7 SU (N2 ) symmetry. The building\n\nblocks are constructed by using the following: (i) SU (k2 ) invariants involve p factors of SU (k1 )\ninvariants and (ii) SU (N1 ) scalars need p factors of SU (N2 ) condensate. This property is based\non the relations k2 = pk1 and N1 = pN2 .\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have developed a matrix model for FQH states at filling factor \u03bdk1 k2 going\nbeyond the Laughlin theory. To illustrate our idea, we have considered a FQH system of a finite\nnumber N = (N1 + N2 ) electrons with filling factor \u03bdk1 k2 \u2261 \u03bdp1 p2 =\n\np2\n;\np1 p2 \u22121\n\np1 is an odd integer\n\nand p2 is an even integer. The \u03bdp1 p2 series corresponds just to the level two of the Haldane\nhierarchy; it recovers the Laughlin series \u03bdp1 =\ntains several observable FQH states of the series\n\n1\nby\np1\nm\n,\n2mp\u00b11\n\ngoing to the limit p2 large and consuch as those states with filling factor\n\n\u03bd = 32 , 25 , * * * Our matrix model, which extends the regularized Susskind theory considered by\n\nPolychronakos for studying FQH droplets, has a U (N1 ) \u00d7 U (N2 ) gauge invariance and assumes\nthat the FQH fluid consists of two coupled branches with filling fractors \u03bdk1 =\n\n1\nk1\n\nand \u03bdk2 =\n\n1\nk2\n\nwhere the k1 and k2 integers are related to Haldane ones as k1 = p1 and k2 = k1 (p1 p2 \u22121) \u2261 pk1 .\n\nThe branch with \u03bdk1 is the fundamental one and that with \u03bdk2 is built on it. Couplings are\nmanifested through three different channels: (1) Through the effective external magnetic field\nB\u2217 =\n\nk2\nB\nk1\n\nfelt by the N2 electrons of the branch with \u03bdk1 ; here B is the external magnetic\n\nfield seen by the N1 electrons of the fundamental branch with \u03bdk2 and responsible for the NC\ngeometry of the plane. (2) by using a natural hypothesis according to which the total U (1)\ncharge of the LLL is equal to the product of the inverse filling factor \u03bd with the number N of\nelectrons. In other words, the LLL fundamental wavefunction |\u03a6 > is subject to the constraint\n\nequation J0 |\u03a6 >=\n\nN\n|\u03a6\n\u03bd\n\n>, where J0 is the U (1) charge operator. Recall in passing that such a\n\nfeature is required as well for the case of the Laughlin states with a finite number of electrons.\n35\n\n\f(3) through the involvement of a new field \u03a8\u03b1a transforming in the bi-fundamental representation (N1 , N2 ) of the U (N1 ) \u00d7 U (N2 ) gauge group. Such a field connects the two branches\n\nb\u0304\nof the fluid, a feature illustrated by naively consideing the field coupling \u03a8\u0304\u1fb1\u0101 Z1 \u03b2\u0304\u03b1 Z2a\n\u03a8\u03b2b where\nb\u0304\nare the matrix field variables for the two branches, respectively. The field \u03a8\u03b1a can\nZ1 \u03b2\u0304\u03b1 and Z2a\n\nalso accomplish the complete regularisation for a consistent matrix model with a finite number\nof particles, without the need to introduce the Polychronakos fields \u03a8\u03b1 and \u03a8a . In this special\ncase the U (1) charge operator reduces to\n\nJ0 =\n\nN1 X\nN2\nX\n\n\u03a8\u0304\u1fb1\u0101 \u03a8\u03b1a\n\n\u03b1=1 a=1\n\n.\n\nThe \u03a8\u03b1a field may be also viewed as the first element of a series of fields in the fundamentals\n(N1 , ..., Nn ) of the (\u2297ni=1 U (Ni )) gauge group of a multi-component fluid matrix model. Recall\nthat the case we have studied here is in fact just a particular FQH states of a more general one\nwhere the fluid droplet is assumed to consist of several coupled branches, say n branches, with\na filling factor\nPn\nki\n\u03bd = Qni=1 .\nj=1 kj\nn = 1 is the Laughlin model, n = 2 is the model we have discussed here and n \u2265 3 is the\n\ngeneric case.\n\nIn this paper we have also studied an interesting feature of singularities in spaces with a NC\ngeometry. This special property has not been addressed before in the context of FQH systems.\nThe point is that the Laughlin wavefunctions (11) with filling factor \u03bd =\n\n1\nk\n\nhave degenerate\n\nzeros as sources of singularities of type Ar . A simple way to see it is to go to the limit\nz\u03b2 = z\u03b1 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\n\nand substitute in the above \u03a6L (11). One obtains a product of monomials \u01ebk\u03b1\u03b2 which behave\nas an SU (k) singularity on the plane. However, due to the presence of the external magnetic\nfield B, the two-space is no longer commutative and one expects this kind of singularity to be\nremoved in agreement with the general property of the absence of singularities in NC spaces.\n36\n\n\fOn the basis of established results in a NC geometry context, especially varieties with discrete\nsymmetries as it is the case for the Laughlin wavefunctions, we have completed previous partial\nresults obtained recently by taking into account the effect of NC geometry. As a consequence,\nthe spectrum involves now a larger symmetry group, namely the U (N1 ) \u00d7 U (N2 ) gauge group\nof the matrix model, but also the SU (k1 ) \u00d7 SU (k2 ) living at the singular points. One of the\n\nstriking results we have obtained in this issue is that real electrons are D0-branes behaving as\nsinglets of the SU (k1 ) \u00d7 SU (k2 ) group. They are composite objects of elementary excitations\n\ntransforming in fundamental representations of the above groups and behave exactly as the\n\nknown fractional D0-branes at singularities one has in brane physics. We have presented the\nessentials about these fractional D0-branes versus FQH fluid droplets, but further insight is\nneeded to obtain the general picture.\nTo end this conclusion, we would like to note that general solutions involving several Pohychronakos fields have been derived in [23]. There it was shown that starting from a matrix\nmodel of a FQH state with filling factor \u03bd = k1 , and replacing the usual Polychronakos action\nterm S\u03a8 by one expressed in terms of a Wilson line gauge field, one gets interesting results\nwith several applications, in particular for the study of multilayer quantum Hall fluids. This\nimportant development seems to have a close link with the approach we have developed in this\npaper, especially the part concerning the study of FQH states of rational filling factor that are\nnot of Laughlin type. Despite this link, we think that the two methods differ in other aspects,\nin particular when one deals with layers with different filling factors. In addition to the fact\nthat the Wilson line generalization of [23] involves only one integer k, contrary to our study,\nan extension of the analysis of [23] may also be worked out as a generalization of the model we\nhave developed in this paper. Details of this direction will be reported elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nA. Jellal and E.H. Saidi would like to thank Professor L. Susskind for several discussions. AJ is\ngrateful to Professors P.
