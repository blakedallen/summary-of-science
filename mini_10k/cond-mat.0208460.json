Given a graph, or a lattice, and given\na number q of available colors, the problem consists in\nfinding a coloring of vertices such that no two neighboring vertices have the same color. The minimally needed\nnumber of colors is the chromatic number of the graph.\nFor planar graphs there exists a famous theorem [3]\nshowing that four colors are sufficient, and that a coloring\ncan be found by an efficient algorithm. On the contrary,\nfor general graphs the problem is computationally hard\nto solve: already in 1972 it was shown that Graph Coloring is NP-complete [4] which means, roughly speaking,\nthat the time required for determining the existence of a\nproper coloring grows exponentially with the graph size.\nIn modern computer science, graph coloring is taken as\none of the most widely used benchmarks for the evaluation of algorithm performance [5]. The interest in coloring stems from the fact that many real-world combinatorial optimization problems have component sub-problems\nwhich can be easily represented as coloring problems. For\ninstance, a classical application is the scheduling of registers in the central processing unit of computers. All\nvariables manipulated by the program are characterized\nby ranges of times during which their values are left unchanged. Any two variables that change during the same\ntime interval cannot be stored in the same register. One\nmay represent the overall computation by constructing a\ngraph where each variable is associated with a vertex and\nedges are placed between any two vertices whose corresponding variables change during the same time interval.\nA proper coloring with a minimal number of colors of\nthis graph provides an optimal scheduling for registers:\ntwo variables with the same color will not be connected\nby an edge and so can be assigned to the same register\n(since they change in different time intervals).\nThe q-coloring problem of random graphs represents\n\na very active field of research in discrete mathematics\nwhich constitutes the natural evolution of the percolation\ntheory initiated by Erd\u00f6s and R\u00e8nyi in the 50's [6]. One\npoint of contact between computer science and random\ngraph theory arises from the observation that, for large\nrandom graphs, there exists a critical average connectivity beyond which the graphs become uncolorable with\nprobability tending to one as the graph size goes to infinity. This transition will be called the q-COL/UNCOL\ntransition throughout this paper. The precise value of the\ncritical connectivity depends of course on the number q of\nallowed colors and on the ensemble of random graphs under consideration. Graphs generated close to their critical connectivity are extraordinarily hard to color and\ntherefore the study of critical instances is at the same\ntime a well posed mathematical question as well as an\nalgorithmic challenge for the understanding of the onset\nof computational complexity [7, 8]. The notion of computational complexity refers to worst-case instances and\ntherefore results for a given ensemble of problems might\nnot be of direct relevance. However, on the more practical side, algorithms which are used to solve real-world\nproblems display a huge variability of running times and\na theory for their typical-case behavior, on classes of nontrivial random instances, constitutes the natural complement to the worst-case analysis. Similarly to what happens for other famous combinatorial problem, e.g. the\nsatisfiability problem of Boolean formulae, critical random instances of q-coloring (or polynomial mappings to\nother NP-complete problems) are a popular test-bed for\nthe performance of search algorithms [5].\nIn physics q-coloring has a direct interpretation as a\nspin-glass model. A proper coloring of a graph is a\nzero-energy ground state configuration of a Potts antiferromagnet with q-state variables. For most lattices this\nsystem is frustrated and displays many equilibrium and\nout-of-equilibrium features of glasses ('Potts glass').\n\n\f2\nHere we focus on the q-coloring problem (or Potts antiferromagnet) over random graphs of finite average connectivity, given by the GN,p ensemble (graphs composed\nof N vertices with edge probability p for every pair of\nvertices). In the relevant limit of finite connectivity we\nhave to take p = c/N which leads to random graphs with\na Poissonian connectivity distribution of mean c.\nTwo types of questions can be asked. One type is algorithmic, i.e. finding an algorithm that decides whether\na given graph is colorable. The other type is more theoretical and amounts to asking whether a typical problem\ninstance is colorable or not and what is the typical structure of the solution space. Here we address the latter\nquestion using the so called cavity method [9].\nLet us start with reviewing some known results on the\nq-COL/UNCOL transition on random graphs. One of the\nfirst important finite-connectivity results was obtained by\nLuczak about one decade ago [10]. He proved that the\nthreshold asymptotically grows like cq \u223c 2q ln q for large\nnumbers of colors, a result, which up to a pre-factor coincides with the outcome of a replica calculation on highly\nconnected graphs [11] (p = O(1) for large N ). For fixed\nnumber q of colors, all vertices with less than q neighbors, i.e. of degree smaller q, can be colored for sure. The\nhardest to color structure is thus given by the maximal\nsubgraph having minimal degree at least q, the so-called\nq-core. Pittel, Spencer and Wormald [12] showed that\nthe emergence of a 2-core coincides with random graph\npercolation at c = 1 [6], and is continuous. For q \u2265 3,\nhowever, the q-core arises discontinuously: For q = 3 they\nfound, e.g., that the core emerges at c \u2243 3.35 and immediately contains about 27% of all vertices. The existence\nof this core is, however, not sufficient for uncolorability:\nThe best lower bound for the 3-COL/UNCOL transition\nis 4.03 [13], numerical results predict a threshold of about\n4.7 [14]. The currently best rigorous upper bound is 4.99\n[15]. Most recently, a replica symmetric analysis of the\nproblem has been performed [16]. The resulting threshold 5.1 exceeds, however, the rigorous bound, and one has\nto go beyond replica symmetry. At the level of one-step\nreplica-symmetry breaking (1RSB) we are able to calculate a threshold value c3 \u2243 4.69 which we believe to be\nexact [17]. We also describe the solution space structure\nwhich undergoes a clustering transition at cd \u2243 4.42.\nAs stated above, the question if a given graph is qcolorable is equivalent to the question if there are zeroenergy ground states of the anti-ferromagnetic q-state\nPotts model defined on the same graph. Denoting the\nset of all edges by E, the problem can thus be described\nby the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u03b4(\u03c3i , \u03c3j )\n\n(1)\n\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\nwith \u03b4(*, *) denoting the Kronecker symbol. The spins\n\u03c3i , i = 1, ..., N, are allowed to take the q values {1, ..., q}.\n\nThis Hamiltonian counts the number of edges being colored equally on both extremities, a proper coloring of\nthe graph thus has energy zero. In this letter we apply the cavity method in a variant recently developed for\nfinite-connectivity graphs directly at zero temperature\n[18, 19, 20]. This approach consists of a self-consistent\niterative scheme which is believed to be exact over locally tree-like graphs, like the ones we consider here. It\nincludes the possibility of dealing with the existence of\nmany pure states. One has to first evaluate the energy\nshift of the system due to the addition of a new new spin\n\u03c30 . Let us assume for a moment that the new spin is only\nconnected to a single spin, say \u03c31 , in the pre-existing\ngraph. Before adding the new site 0, the ground-state\nenergy of the system with fixed \u03c31 can be expressed as\nE0 (\u03c31 ) = A \u2212\n\nq\nX\n\nh1\u03c4 \u03b4(\u03c4, \u03c31 )\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c4 =1\n\nwhere we have introduced the effective field ~h1 =\n(h11 , ..., h1q ). Note that a (q\u22121)-dimensional field would be\nsufficient since one of the q fields above can be absorbed\nin A. We, however, prefer to work with q field components in order to keep evident the global color symmetry.\nConnecting \u03c30 to \u03c31 , and calculating the minimal energy\nof the enlarged graph with fixed \u03c30 , this reads\n!\nq\nX\n1\nh\u03c4 \u03b4(\u03c4, \u03c31 ) + \u03b4(\u03c30 , \u03c31 )\nE(\u03c30 ) = min A \u2212\n\u03c31\n\n\u03c4 =1\n\n= A \u2212 \u03c9(~h1 ) \u2212\n\nq\nX\n\nu\u03c4 (~h1 )\u03b4(\u03c4, \u03c30 )\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c4 =1\n\nwith\n\u03c9(~h) = \u2212 min(\u2212h1 , ..., \u2212hq )\n(4)\n\u001a\n\u22121 if \u2212 h\u03c4 < \u2212h1 , .., \u2212h\u03c4 \u22121 , \u2212h\u03c4 +1 , .., \u2212hq\nu\u03c4 (~h) =\n0 else\nThe field ~u(~h1 ) has at most one non-zero component,\nwhich takes the value \u22121, i.e. ~u(~h1 ) \u2208 {~0, \u2212~e1 , ..., \u2212~eq }\nwith ~e\u03c4 denoting a unit vector in direction \u03c4 .\nIf the new spin \u03c30 is connected to d sites with fields\n~h1 , ..., ~hd , and if these spins were previously uncorrelated\n(which is the case inside one pure state, cf. the discussion\nin [9]), the propagated fields can be linearly superposed,\n~h0 = Pd ~u(~hi ) . Note that the fields never become\ni=1\npositive, which reflects the anti-ferromagnetic character\nof the model. Colors are suppressed by neighbors carrying this color, they can be favored only by suppressing all\nother colors. If there would be a single state (replica symmetry), every link (i, j) would carry two propagated fields\n~ui\u2192j and ~uj\u2192i which are determined self-consistently. In\ncase of multiple states, these fields fluctuate from state to\nstate and have to be characterized by a full distribution\n\n\f3\nQi\u2192j (~u), cf. [9, 20]. Due to the global color symmetry,\neach of these takes the form\nQi\u2192j (~u) = (1 \u2212 q\u03b7i\u2192j )\u03b4(~u) + \u03b7i\u2192j\n\nq\nX\n\n\u03b4(~u + ~e\u03c4 )\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c4 =1\n\nand can thus be fully described by the probability \u03b7i\u2192j\nthat any of the colors of vertex j is forbidden by edge\n(i, j). Denoting the histogram of all \u03b7i\u2192j by \u03c1(\u03b7),\nthe self-consistency equation for the distribution of the\nQi\u2192j (~u) can be reduced to a simple equation for \u03c1(\u03b7)\n[21],\n\u03c1(\u03b7) = e\u2212c\n\n\u221e d Z\nX\nc\nd=0\n\nd!\n\n1/q\n\nd\u03b71 * * * d\u03b7d \u03c1(\u03b71 ) * * * \u03c1(\u03b7d )\n\n0\n\n\u00d7\u03b4(\u03b7 \u2212 fd (\u03b71 , ..., \u03b7d ))\nwhere fd is simply given by\nPq\u22121\n(\u22121)l\nfd (\u03b71 , ..., \u03b7d ) = Pl=0\nq\u22121\nl\nl=0 (\u22121)\n\n(6)\n\n\u0001\nq\u22121 Qd\ni=1 [1 \u2212 (l + 1)\u03b7i ]\nl\n\u0001 Qd\nq\ni=1 [1 \u2212 (l + 1)\u03b7i ]\nl+1\n\n(7)\nThis equation resembles a replica-symmetric selfconsistent equation and can be solved numerically using\na population dynamical algorithm: We start with an initial population \u03b71 , ..., \u03b7N of size N which can be easily\nchosen to be as large as 106 to generate high-precision\ndata. This population is updated by iterating the following steps until convergence: (I) Randomly draw a number\nd from the Poisson distribution e\u2212c cd /d!; (II) Randomly\nselect d + 1 indices i0 , i1 , ..., id from {1, ..., N }; (III) Update the population by replacing \u03b7i0 by fd (\u03b7i1 , ..., \u03b7id ).\nOne obvious solution of Eq. (7) is the paramagnetic\nsolution \u03b4(\u03b7). For small average connectivities c it is\neven the only one. The appearance of a non-trivial solution coincides with a clustering transition of ground\nstates into an exponentially large number of extensively\nseparated clusters. In spin-glass theory, this transition\nis called dynamical. Still, \u03c1(\u03b7) will contain a non-trivial\npeak in \u03b7 = 0 due to small disconnected subgraphs, dangling ends etc. The weight t of this peak can be computed\nself-consistently from\n\nthe existence of a solution t < 1 is not sufficient for a\nnon-trivial \u03c1(\u03b7) to exist. The latter appears suddenly at\nthe dynamical transition cd , which can be determined to\nhigh precision using the population dynamical algorithm.\nThis solution does not imply uncolorability, but the set of\nsolutions is separated into an exponentially large number\nof clusters. The logarithm of their number, divided by\nthe graph size N , is called the complexity \u03a3(c) and can\nbe calculated from \u03c1(\u03b7), cf. [20]\n\u221e d Z\nX\nc\n\u2212c\n\u03a3(c) = e\nd\u03b71 * * * d\u03b7d \u03c1(\u03b71 ) * * * \u03c1(\u03b7d )\nd!\nd=1\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013Y\nq\u22121\nd\nX\nq\n[1 \u2212 (l + 1)\u03b7i ]\n\u00d7 ln\n(\u22121)l\nl + 1 i=1\nl=0\nZ\nc\nd\u03b71 d\u03b72 \u03c1(\u03b71 )\u03c1(\u03b72 ) ln(1 \u2212 q\u03b71 \u03b72 ) .

The static RSB transition, and thus the\nq-COL/UNCOL threshold cq , are given by the point of\nvanishing complexity. At this point the number of clusters becomes sub-exponential, and disappears beyond cq .\n3\n\nt = e\u2212(1\u2212t)c\n\nl=0\n\nl!\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nq=4\n0.04\n\n\u03a3\n0.02\n\nq=3\n\n0\n5\n\nq\n4\n\n3\n3\n\nq\u22122\nX\n(1 \u2212 t)l cl\n\n4\n\n0.06\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nc\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThis equation is quite interesting, since a non-trivial solution forms a necessary condition for Eq. (6) to have\na non-trivial solution. In fact [12], the fraction of edges\nin the q-core is given by (1 \u2212 tmin ) with tmin being the\nsmallest positive solution of Eq. (8). Thus, we also find\nthat the existence of an extensive q-core is necessary for\na non-trivial \u03c1(\u03b7), and forms a lower bound for the qCOL/UNCOL transition.\nUnlike in the case of finite-connectivity p-spin-glasses\nor, equivalently, random XOR-SAT problems [22, 23, 24],\n\nFIG. 1: Top: Complexity \u03a3(c) vs. average connectivity for\nq = 3 and q = 4. Non-zero complexity appears discontinuously at the dynamical threshold cd , and goes down continuously to zero at the q-COL/UNCOL transition.

The symbols give results of smallk for N = 103 , each averaged over 100 samples.\n\nIn the following table, we present the results for\nq = 3, 4, and 5.

On the physics side, this\ninformation allows to develop a single sample statistical\nmechanics analysis whereas on the algorithmic side it allows develop new algorithms [25].\nWe are grateful to A.

This means that the clustering phenomenon becomes more and more pronounced,\nthe number of clusters increases, their internal entropy\ns(c) \u2212 \u03a3(c) becomes smaller. It also becomes more relevant for small systems. At N = 100 and the dynamical\nthreshold, we would predict only around 10 clusters for\nq = 3, for q = 4 this number would already be close to\n250, and grow to about 2800 for 5 colors.\nThe dynamical transition is not only characterized by\na sudden clustering of ground states, at the same point\nan exponential number of meta-stable states of positive\nenergy appears [20]. Such states are expected to act as\ntraps for local search algorithms causing an exponential\nslowing down of the search process. Well known examples\nof search processes that are overwhelmed by the presence\nof excited states are simulated annealing or greedy algorithms based on local information.\nTo test this prediction, we have applied several of the\nbest solvers for COL and SAT problems available in the\nnet [5, 28]. The best results could be obtained using\nthe complete smallk program [28] which may need exponential time to find a proper minimal coloring. Using a\ncutoff time (we probed with 10 seconds, 1 minute and 2\nminutes without substantial changes for N = 103 ), the\nalgorithm can be restricted to sub-exponential times, i.e.\nonly the underlying polynomial-time heuristic is applied.\nThe results in Fig. 1 were obtained in the following way:\nWe first tried to color a random graph (N = 103 ) with\na small number of colors (here q = 3). If, after the cutoff time, smallk did not find a coloring, we stopped and\nretried with larger q. For each connectivity we averaged\nover 100 samples. As it can be clearly seen, the algorithm fails with q colors slightly below the dynamical\ntransition, confirming our expectations. Only a perfect\nlocal heuristic should reach this threshold.\nWe conclude by noticing that, in similarity to the 3SAT problem [20], we expect the assumptions underlying\nthe cavity approach to hold for single instances of COL.\nThe equations for the order parameter on single instances\nprovide the full histogram of the N probability distributions of the effective fields, one for each variable, which\ndescribe the fluctuations of the polarization of each Potts\n\n[1] M.
