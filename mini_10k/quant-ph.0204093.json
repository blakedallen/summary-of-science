In this article the authors gave a tight characterization of\nthe number of bits that two parties need to exchange in order to approximate a\njoint state \u03c8AB . This characterization relied critically on the assumption that\ninitially A and B do not share any entanglement.\nThe setting in which the parties are allowed to use entanglement to assist\ntheir state preparation has been the topic of many investigations in the physics\ncommunity. Typically, these articles concentrated on the possibility of creating\n\u03c8AB under the restriction that only classical communication is allowed [3, 14,\n28].\nThe quantum communication complexity of distributed functions was first\nconsidered in the work by Yao and Kremer [30, 17]. Kremer's work in particular\ndemonstrated several lower bounds on the quantum communication complexity\nof distributed functions. The first example of a quantum protocol that requires less communication than any classical solution was described by Cleve\nand Buhrman in 1997 [7]. General lower bound techniques for quantum communication have been described have been described in [2], [6], [8], [16], [20] and\n[25]. Specifically, the results in this paper can be interpreted as generalizing and\nrefining the lower bound techniques of [2] and [8].\n\n1.2\n\nTools from Quantum Information\n\nIn this paper we will often be concerned with pure states \u03c8AB = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|AB of a\ncomposite system AB. For any such state P\nthere\n\u221a exist orthonormal bases {|iA i}\non A and {|iB i} on B such that |\u03c8AB i = i \u03bbi |iA i|iB i. This representation\nis known as the Schmidt decomposition. The degree of entanglement of \u03c8AB\nis then naturally characterized by the spectrum {\u03bbi } of the reduced density\noperator \u03c8A := TrB (\u03c8AB ). (Since \u03c8AB is pure, \u03c8A and \u03c8B have the same\nspectra.) In particular, log rank(\u03c8A ) and the von Neumann entropy S(\u03c8A ) :=\n\u2212 Tr(\u03c8A log \u03c8A ) have been extensively studied as \"measures of entanglement\".\nIndeed, in the limit of large numbers of copies of the state \u03c8AB , S(\u03c8A ) completely characterizes the states reversibly convertible into \u03c8AB using only local\noperations and classical communication [3].\nSince we will be be studying approximate transformations of quantum states\nand their connection to bounded-error quantum communication complexity, it\nwill be helpful to introduce some distance measures from quantum information theory. The Uhlmann fidelity F between two states \u03c1 and \u03c3 is defined by\nF (\u03c1, \u03c3) = Tr(\u03c11/2 \u03c3\u03c11/2 )1/2 . The range of the Uhlmann fidelity is the interval\n[0, 1], reaching the extreme values 0 and 1 for perfectly distinguishable and identical states, respectively. In the case of two pure states \u03c6 and \u03c8, the expression\nfor F simplifies to F (\u03c6, \u03c8) = |h\u03c6|\u03c8i|. Thus, the fidelity F (\u03c1, \u03c3) indicates how\n'close' \u03c1 and \u03c3 are. Furthermore, no quantum mechanical evolution decreases\nthe fidelity between two states: F (\u03c1, \u03c3) \u2265 F (\u039b(\u03c1), \u039b(\u03c3)) for all states \u03c1, \u03c3 and\nall trace-preserving, completely positive mappings \u039b [27, 15]. In particular, if\n\n2\n\n\f\u039b is the partial trace TrB , this reduces to F (\u03c1A , \u03c3A ) \u2264 F (\u03c1AB , \u03c3AB ) for any\nbipartite states \u03c1AB and \u03c3AB .\n\n2\n\nQuantum Communication Complexity of State\nTransformation and Distributed Computation\n\nOur starting point will be the question of how much communication between\ntwo parties A and B is required to transform a joint quantum state \u03c6AB into\nanother state \u03c8AB . To distinguish between the settings where A and B are\nor are not allowed to use prior entanglement, we introduce the following three\ncomplexity measures:\nDefinition 2.1 The transformation complexity, Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ), is the minimum number of bits (quantum and classical) of communication required, start\u2032\ning from the known state |\u03c6AB i to produce an approximating state \u03c8AB\nsuch\n\u2032\nthat F (\u03c8AB , \u03c8AB ) > 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\n\u2032\nWhen \u01eb = 0 this definition requires that the final state \u03c8AB\nbe equal to \u03c8AB .\nIt is also worth emphasizing that this definition of Q\u0304\u01eb does not allow A and B\nto have any prior entanglement other than that of their state \u03c6. The following\ncomplexity definition does allow such a resource:\n\nDefinition 2.2 The entanglement-enhanced transformation complexity Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb of\nthe two states \u03c8AB and \u03c6AB is defined by\nQ\u0304\u2217\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ) =\n\ninf Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB \u2297 \u03c9AB |\u03c6AB \u2297 \u03c9AB ),\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9AB\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all possible bipartite pure states |\u03c9AB i.\nA third version of transformation complexity concerns the usage of prior entanglement only in the form of 'EPR-pairs'.\n(\u2217)\n\nDefinition 2.3 The EPR-enhanced transformation complexity Q\u0304\u01eb\nby\n\nis defined\n\ninf Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB \u2297 \u03a6kAB |\u03c6AB \u2297 \u03a6kAB ),\n\n(2)\n\nQ\u0304(\u2217)\n\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ) =\n\n\u03a6k\nAB\n\nwhere the infimum\nPk is taken over all maximally entangled states of any rank\n|\u03a6kAB i := \u221a1k j=1 |j, ji.\n\nAn important feature of the two entanglement-enhanced complexities is the\nrequirement that the entangled state \u03c9AB (or \u03a6kAB ) be returned (with fidelity\nat least 1 \u2212 \u01eb) after the transformation protocol. Without this requirement the\ndefinitions would be vacuous because in the setting where we are allowed to\nuse arbitrary entangled states as a disposable resource we could always choose\n\u03c9 = \u03c8 such that no communication is necessary.\n3\n\n\fInstead, we view the prior entanglement as a potential catalyst, which allows\nus to reduce the communication complexity of the state transformation without\ndestroying the entanglement. The fact that such catalysis is possible in a nontrivial way was first pointed out in [14].\nWe will also make use of some shorthand notation to describe state transformations in which A and B do not share any initial state \u03c6. The complexities of\nsuch state preparations will be denoted without the conditional \u03c6: Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8), Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb (\u03c8)\n(\u2217)\nand Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8).\n\u2022\n\nThe 'quantum sampling complexity' Q\u01eb (\u03c8) that was discussed in [2] concerned the (approximate) preparation of quantum states without the use of prior\n\u2022\n\nentanglement. Hence the Q\u01eb (\u03c8) complexity in that article equals the quantity\nQ\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8) that we defined here.\nIn the next sections of this article we will prove a dramatic difference between\n(\u2217)\nthe complexities Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb and Q\u0304\u01eb . On the one hand, we will show that Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb is always\nzero for every \u01eb > 0, while on the other hand we will describe several lower\n(\u2217)\nbound techniques for the complexity Q\u0304\u01eb .\nThe lower bounds on the EPR-enhanced transformation complexity will also\ngive rise to several lower bounds on the quantum communication complexity for\nthe distributed evaluation of Boolean functions f : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 {0, 1}. In this\nsetting, Alice receives an input x \u2208 X and Bob gets y \u2208 Y . The question then\nis how many bits Alice and Bob need to communication for a (probabilistic)\nevaluation of the function value f (x, y). The original version, in which only\nclassical communication is allowed, was first introduced by Yao [29] and has\ndeveloped rapidly since [18]. In the quantum context, it makes sense to allow\nAlice and Bob various combinations of quantum resources to complete the task,\nsuch as communication of qubits or pre-existing entanglement. More specifically,\nlet us assume that Alice and Bob receive n bit inputs, so that X = Y = {0, 1}n\nand that there is a family of functions f , one for each n. We write Q\u2217\u01eb (f ) to\ndenote the number of qubits of communication, as a function of n, required to\nevaluate f with probability of success at least 1 \u2212 \u01eb on every input if Alice and\n(\u2217)\nBob are allowed arbitrary pre-existing entanglement. We also write Q\u01eb (f ) for\nthe same function if Alice and Bob are initially allowed to share any maximally\nentangled state but not other types of entanglement.\nThe connection between the communication complexity of distributed functions and that of state transformations was first discussed in [8], where it was\nused to obtain a lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of the\ninner product function. We reproduce from [2] (with a small correction) the\nfollowing version of the lower bound. In the context of pre-existing entanglement, the connection is between distributed function evaluation protocols that\nconsume entanglement and state transformation protocols that are catalyzed by\nentanglement.\nLemma 2.4 (Transition lemma) Let f : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 {\u22121, +1} be a (partial)\nfunction with quantum communication complexity Q\u2217\u01eb (f ). For any l2 distribu-\n\n4\n\n\ftion P\n\u03b1 : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 C that has \u03b1xy = 0 where f (x, y) is P\nnot properly defined\n2\nand\n|\u03b1\n|\n=\n1,\nwe\ndefine\nthe\ntwo\nstates\n|\u03c6\ni\n=\nAB\nxyP xy\n(x,y) \u03b1xy |x, yi and\n|\u03c8AB i = (x,y) \u03b1xy f (x, y)|x, yi. The transformation complexity of these states\n(\u2217)\n\n(\u2217)\n\nis bounded from above by Q\u0304\u22172\u01eb (\u03c8|\u03c6) \u2264 2Q\u2217\u01eb (f ). Similarly, Q\u03042\u01eb (\u03c8|\u03c6) \u2264 2Q\u01eb (f )\nand Q\u03042\u01eb (\u03c8|\u03c6) \u2264 2Q\u01eb (f ).\n\nProof Suppose that we have an m-bit protocol to compute f with error probability at most \u01eb. First, A and B run this protocol\nPon the distributed distribution \u03c6AB , which will produce the superposition (x,y) \u03b1xy |x, y, f (x, y), gxy i\nwhere gx y is the garbage that the protocol has produced. Next, the function\nvalue f (x, y) is used for the phase changing operation |x, yi 7\u2192 f (x, g)|x, yi.\nFinally, the m-bit protocol is executed 'in reverse' to erase the garbage qubits\n|f (x, y), gxy i. The final\nP result of this 2m-bit protocol is with fidelity 1 \u2212 2\u01eb the\ndesired state |\u03c8i = (x,y) \u03b1xy |x, yi.\nSee the appendix of [2] for a more detailed analysis of the fidelity of this\nprocedure. (Note however that fidelity error of the resulting Q\u0304-protocol is 2\u01eb,\nnot \u01eb as mentioned in [2][Ambainis, private communication].)\n\u2737\n\n3\n3.1\n\nSome Basic Observations\nEmbezzling entanglement\n\nWhile the distinction drawn in the previous section between the functions Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb\n(\u2217)\nand Q\u0304\u01eb might appear to be academic at first, their behaviors are actually rad(\u2217)\nically different: Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb is identically zero for \u01eb 6= 0 but Q\u0304\u01eb is not. In other words,\ntransformation complexity is trivial in the presence of arbitrary entanglement\nbut not in the presence of unlimited amounts of maximal entanglement. The\nreason for this striking difference lies in the remarkable properties of the family\nof states\n|M (d)i :=\nwhere Hd :=\n\nPd\n\n1\nj=1 j\n\nd\n1 X 1\n\u221a\n\u221a |jA i|jB i,\nHd j=1 j\n\n(3)\n\nis chosen so that |M (d)i is normalized.\n\nTheorem 3.1 (Embezzlement [9]) If \u01eb > 0 is fixed and |\u03c6AB i is any entangled state, then for all sufficiently large d, Q\u0304\u01eb (M (d) \u2297 \u03c6AB |M (d)) = 0. Consequently, Q\u0304\u2217\u01eb is zero for all \u01eb > 0.\nThus, it is possible to embezzle a copy of |\u03c6AB i from |M (d)i, thereby removing\na small amount of entanglement from the original state, while causing only an\narbitrarily small disturbance \u01eb to it. See [9] for a proof of this theorem.\n\n5\n\n\f3.2\n\nOne-round versus Multi-round Protocols\n\nLemma 3.2 If there exists a bipartite quantum communication protocol that\ntransforms the initial state |\u03c6AB i to final state |\u03c8AB i that requires q qubits of\ncommunication, then there also exists a one-round protocol, q qubit protocol that\nestablishes the maping |\u03c6AB i 7\u2192 |\u03c8AB i. Hence, the transformation complexities\nQ\u0304 and Q\u0304(\u2217) are completely described by the complexities of the one-round protocols.\nProof First we note that at any stage of the protocol, A and B always have\nperfect knowledge about the state that they share at that moment. This is due\nto the facts that A and B know the initial state \u03c6AB and that the procotol can\nbe assumed to be unitary. Specifically, it is always known what the Schmidt\ncoefficients are of the current state. With this viewpoint it is clear that the\ncommunication only serves the purpose of changing these coefficients, everything\nelse can be done locally. A qubit\nfrom Bob to Alice will thus\nP \u221aof communication\nP p\nestablish a transformation\n\u03bbi |iA , iB i 7\u2192\n\u03bb\u2032i |i\u2032A , i\u2032B i, written in the\ni\ni\nSchmidt decomposition of the prior and posterior state. By symmetry, this same\ntransformation \u03bbi 7\u2192 \u03bb\u2032i can also be implemented by a qubit of communication\nfrom Alice to Bob. Hence, in general, all communication from Bob to Alice can\nbe replaced by an equal amount of communication in the opposite direction. \u2737\nThis argument is very similar to the one given by Lo and Popescu [19] to\nreduce the study of multi-round LOCC (Local Operations and Classical Communication) state transformation protocols to single round protocols.\nThis lemma also points to a connection with another basic question about\nquantum states. Suppose Alice and Bob initially share a tripartite state |\u03c6ACB i,\nwith Alice in possession of A and C. If Alice sends subsystem C to Bob, then\nher reduced density operator changes from \u03c6AC to \u03c6A . Thus, the problem of\nstate transformation is intimately connected to the question of determining the\neffect of a partial trace operation on a density operator's spectrum. While the\ngeneral answer to this question is unknown, Nielsen and Kempe [23] have found\nsome partial results for the case where \u03c6AC is separable.\n\n3.3\n\nDifference between Q\u0304 and Q\u0304(\u2217) ?\n\nIs there a difference between the transformation complexities Q\u0304 and Q\u0304(\u2217) ? Or,\nin other words, does prior EPR entanglement help? We do not know the answer\nin the general case, but we do get an indication that the two might be equivalent\nby looking at the case where the prior state \u03c6AB is not entangled. Recall that\nthe transformation complexity with a prior product state |\u03c6AB i = |\u03c6A i \u2297 |\u03c6B i\nis denoted by Q\u0304(\u03c8AB ) := Q\u0304(\u03c8AB |\u03c6A \u2297 \u03c6B ).\n(\u2217)\n\nLemma 3.3 Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) = Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB ). Hence, by the 'quantum sampling' paper\n(\u2217)\n\n\u2022\n\n[2], Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) = Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) =Q\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) = log(rank1\u2212\u01eb (\u03c8A )), where rank1\u2212\u01eb (\u03c8A )\nis the size of the smallest subset of eigenvalues of \u03c8A summing to at least 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\n\n6\n\n\fProof\nLet (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) be the spectrum of the Schmidt decomposition of\n\u03c8AB . AssumePthat the optimal EPR-assisited protocol uses the k-level state\n|\u03a6kAB i := \u221a1k kj=1 |j, ji, such that the spectrum change of this protocol is de-\n\nscribed by ( k1 , . . . , k1 ) 7\u2192 (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) \u2297 ( k1 , . . . , k1 ) \u2261 ( \u03bbk1 , . . . , \u03bbk1 , \u03bbk2 , . . . , \u03bbkr ),\nwhere we reshufled the amplitudes in nonincreasing order. To get an approximating spectrum with no more than \u01eb error to this last state, we need a final\nstate with rank at least k * rank(1\u2212\u01eb) (\u03c8AB ). Because we start with a rank k state\n\u03a6kAB we see that we need at least log(rank(1\u2212\u01eb) (\u03c8AB )) qubits of communication,\n\u2022\n\nwhich is also an upper bound on Q\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) := Q\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB ) (see [2]).\n\n\u2737\n\n(\u2217)\n\n4\n\nLower bounds on Q\u0304\u01eb\n\nIn this section we will use the properties of the R\u00e9nyi entropies [26] to prove\nbounds on the transformation complexity in the presence of maximally entangled\nstates.\n\n4.1\n\nR\u00e9nyi entropy\n\nDefinition 4.1 Given a density matrix \u03c1 with spectrum \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbr ,\nits R\u00e9nyi entropy S\u03b1 (\u03c1) is defined to be\n!\nr\nX\n1\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03bbi\n(4)\nlog(Tr \u03c1 ) =\nlog\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1) =\n1\u2212\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1\ni=1\nfor every 0 < \u03b1 < \u221e, \u03b1 6= 1. Furthermore, for the values \u03b1 = 0, 1, \u221e we define\nS0 (\u03c1) = log(rank(\u03c1)), S1 (\u03c1) = \u2212 Tr(\u03c1 log \u03c1) and S\u221e (\u03c1) = \u2212 log(\u03bb1 ). Note that\nlimx\u2192\u03b1 Sx (\u03c1) = S\u03b1 (\u03c1).\nWe have already encountered S1 , which is just the von Neumann entropy\nS. The other exceptional orders, 0 and \u221e, are, likewise, quantities that appear\nfrequently in quantum information theory and communication complexity. The\nfollowing theorem summarizes the basic properties of the R\u00e9nyi entropies.\nTheorem 4.2 Let \u03c1 be a density operator with spectrum \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr . The following properties hold for all \u03b1:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nThe inequalities 0 \u2264 S\u03b1 (\u03c1) \u2264 log rank(\u03c1) hold.\nFor \u03b1 6= 0, the entropy is maximized if and only if \u03bbi = 1r .\nThe entropy is minimized only by pure states.\n(Additivity) For two density matrices: S\u03b1 (\u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 ) = S\u03b1 (\u03c11 ) + S\u03b1 (\u03c12 ).\nIf \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 then S\u03b1 (\u03c1) \u2265 S\u03b2 (\u03c1).\n(Schur concavity) If \u03c1 \u227b \u03c3 then S\u03b1 (\u03c1) \u2264 S\u03b1 (\u03c3).\n\nThe notation \u03c1 \u227b \u03c3 means that spectrum of the operator \u03c1 majorizes\nspecPthe\nl\ntrum of \u03c3.

While\nsubadditivity of the form S(\u03c1AB ) \u2264 S(\u03c1A ) + S(\u03c1B ) fails for the R\u00e9nyi entropies\nunless \u03b1 is 0 or 1, replacing one of the terms on the right hand side by the\nlogarithm of the rank of \u03c1B , that is, by S0 (\u03c1B ), gives an inequality that holds\nfor all \u03b1.\nLemma 4.3 (Weak subadditivity) Let \u03c1AB be a bipartite density matrix.\nFor all \u03b1, the R\u00e9nyi entropy of the states is bounded by\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1A ) \u2212 S0 (\u03c1B )\n\n\u2264\n\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1AB )\n\n\u2264\n\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1A ) + S0 (\u03c1B ).\n\nProof We will first prove the upper bound on S\u03b1 (\u03c1AB ) and then show how\nthe lower bound follows. Let {|iA i} be the eigenbasis of the reduced density\noperator \u03c1A and consider the projection\nX\n|iA ihiA | \u2297 hiA |\u03c1AB |iA i.\nP (\u03c1AB ) =\ni\n\nSince P is a doubly stochastic mapping and the R\u00e9nyi entropies are all Schurconcave, we have S\u03b1 (\u03c1AB ) \u2264 S\u03b1 (P (\u03c1AB )). We begin by assuming that \u03b1 6=\n0, 1, \u221e; the exceptional values will follow by continuity. Also, we will use the\nnotation \u03bbi = Tr(hiA |\u03c1AB |iA i) and \u03c1i = hiA |\u03c1AB |iA i/\u03bbi , such that P (\u03c1AB ) =\nP\ni \u03bbi |iihi| \u2297 \u03c1i . Next, observe that\nsign(1 \u2212 \u03b1) * Tr(\u03c1\u03b1\ni )\n\n\u2264 sign(1 \u2212 \u03b1) * (rank(\u03c1i ))1\u2212\u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nfor all \u03b1, which is the last ingredient required to finish the proof of the upper\nbound:\nP\n(6)\nS\u03b1 (P (\u03c1AB )) = S\u03b1 ( i \u03bbi |iA ihiA | \u2297 \u03c1i )\nP\n\u03b1\n1\n= 1\u2212\u03b1 log (Tr [( i \u03bbi |iA ihiA | \u2297 \u03c1i ) ])\n(7)\nP \u03b1\n1\n\u03b1\n= 1\u2212\u03b1 log ( i \u03bbi Tr \u03c1i )\n(8)\n\u0001\nP \u03b1\n1\n1\u2212\u03b1\n(9)\n\u2264 1\u2212\u03b1 log\ni \u03bbi (rank(\u03c1i ))\n\u2264\n\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1A ) + log rank(\u03c1B ).\n\n(10)\n\nThe last line follows from the fact that TrB (P (\u03c1AB )) = \u03c1A so that the \u03bbi are\njust the eigenvalues of \u03c1A , and the fact that rank(\u03c1i ) \u2264 rank(\u03c1B ).\nThe lower bound is a straightforward consequence of the upper bound.\nGiven \u03c1AB , let \u03c8ABR be a pure state such that TrR \u03c8ABR = \u03c1AB , and hence\nSpec(\u03c1A ) = Spec(\u03c8BR ) and Spec(\u03c1AB ) = Spec(\u03c8R ). The upper bound reads\nS\u03b1 (\u03c8BR ) \u2264 S\u03b1 (\u03c8R ) + log rank(\u03c8B ), which is equivalent to\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1A ) \u2212 log rank(\u03c1B ) \u2264\n\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1AB ).\n\nThe \u03b1 = \u221e case is proven via the equality limx\u2192\u221e Sx (\u03c1) = S\u221e (\u03c1).\n8\n\n(11)\n\u2737\n\n\fThere is an alternative method of proving lemma 4.3 that builds on known\nresults about state transformations. Let |\u03c6ACB i be a tripartite pure state, with\nAlice in possession of the shares A and C. One way for Alice to send system\nC to Bob would be to first send him half a maximally entangled state of rank\nk := rank(\u03c6C ) and then to teleport [4] system C using that maximally entangled\nstate. Since teleportation is an LOCC protocol, Alice's final reduced density\noperator \u03c6A must majorize the operator \u03c6AC \u2297 diag(1/k, . . . , 1/k) [21]. Since\nthe R\u00e9nyi entropies are Schur concave, we can deduce the left-hand inequality\nof lemma 4.3.\n\n4.2\n\nR\u00e9nyi-entropic bounds on communication\n\nThe following lemma is the starting point for proving bounds on the approximate\ntransformation complexity. Namely, it bounds the minimum number of qubits\nthat need to be exchanged in order to succeed in an exact transformation.\nLemma 4.4 Let |\u03c6AB i and |\u03c8AB i be bipartite pure states. If there exists a\nprotocol for converting |\u03c6AB i to |\u03c8AB i using n qubits of communication, then\nn \u2265 S\u03b1 (\u03c8A ) \u2212 S\u03b1 (\u03c6A ), for all \u03b1.\nProof The most general protocol consists of k rounds of communication, separated by arbitrary completely positive, trace-preserving operations performed\nlocally by Alice and Bob. Since each of these local operations can be implemented by adjoining a pure ancilla state, applying a unitary and then discarding part of the system, we can assume without loss of generality that the first\nstep of the protocol consists of adjoining pure, separable ancilla, that each local\noperation by Alice or Bob is unitary and that the discard steps are all postponed to the end of the protocol. We will now analyze each of these three\nphases in turn. Adjoining separable ancilla does not affect the non-zero part of\nthe spectrum of the reduced density operator, or, therefore, the R\u00e9nyi entropy.\nThe second phase, by lemma 3.2, can be assumed to consist of a single round\nof communication from Alice to Bob. By the weak subadditivity of the Renyi\nentropy, the increase in S\u03b1 at this step is no more than the number of qubits\nof communication. Finally, at the discard step, by the additivity of the R\u00e9nyi\nentropies over tensor products, S\u03b1 is non-increasing.\n\u2737\nWhile lemma 4.4 is itself a consequence of the Schur concavity of the R\u00e9nyi\nentropies and Nielsen's theorem [21], by making further use of the properties\nof the R\u00e9nyi entropies, it can be adapted to study questions that Nielsen's\ntheorem does not address, like the amount of classical communication required\nto perform entanglement dilution [12].\nThe following lemma gives dimension-independent estimates of the R\u00e9nyi entropy for states that are close together. In contrast, the analogous result for the\nvon Neumann entropy, known as the Fannes inequality [10], has a logarithmic\ndependence on the rank of the states.\n\n9\n\n\fLemma 4.5 Let F (\u03c1, \u03c3) > 1 \u2212 \u01eb. For all 1/2 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 the R\u00e9nyi entropies of\norder \u03b1 of \u03c1 are bounded below by\nS\u03b1 (\u03c1)\n\n\u2265 S\u03b2 (\u03c3) +\n\n2\u03b1\nlog(1 \u2212 \u01eb),\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b2 = \u221e if \u03b1 = 1/2 and \u03b2 = \u03b1/(2\u03b1 \u2212 1) otherwise.\nProof It can be shown\n[11] that F (\u03c1, \u03c3) is the minimum over all measurements\nP p\n{Mi } of the function i Tr(Mi \u03c1) Tr(Mi \u03c3). P\nChoosing {Mi } to be projection in\na basis that diagonalizes \u03c1 yields F (\u03c1, \u03c3) \u2264 i (\u03bbi \u03c9i )1/2 , where \u03c9i = Tr(Mi \u03c3)\nand {\u03bbi } is the spectrum of P\n\u03c1. When \u03b1\nP application of H\u00f6lder's\nP> 1/2, an\ninequality, which states that i xi yi \u2264 ( i xpi )1/p ( i yiq )1/q when xi , yi \u2265 0,\np > 1 and 1/p + 1/q = 1, with p = 2\u03b1/(2\u03b1 \u2212 1) and q = 2\u03b1, yields\nlog(1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u2264\n\nX \u03b1/(2\u03b1\u22121)\nX\n1\n2\u03b1 \u2212 1\n+\n\u03c9i\n\u03bb\u03b1\nlog\nlog\ni\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b1\ni\ni\n\nupon taking logarithms on both sides. Because the \u03c9i are outcome probabilities\nof a projective measurement, the vector (\u03c9i ) is majorized by the spectrum of\n\u03c3 [1]. The Schur concavity of the R\u00e9nyi entropies then implies that S\u03b2 (\u03c9i ) \u2265\nS\u03b2 (\u03c3), completing the proof of the lemma for \u03b1 6= 1/2. The \u03b1 = 1/2 case follows\nby taking limits.\n\u2737\nBecause the previous result makes no reference to the rank of the states \u03c1\nand \u03c3, it can be combined with lemma 4.4 to yield a family of bounds on the\ntransformation complexity in the presence of unlimited amounts of entanglement. These bounds, in turn, provide a convenient way to derive bounds on the\nquantum communication complexity of distributed function evaluation.\nTheorem 4.6 For any bipartite pure state |\u03c6AB i and |\u03c8AB i, and any 1/2 \u2264\n\u03b1 < 1, the transformation complexity obeys the inequality\nQ\u0304(\u2217)\n\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ) \u2265\n\nS\u03b2 (\u03c8A ) \u2212 S\u03b1 (\u03c6A ) +\n\n2\u03b1\nlog(1 \u2212 \u01eb),\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = \u221e if \u03b1 = 1/2 and \u03b2 = \u03b1/(2\u03b1 \u2212 1) otherwise.\nSuppose that there exists a maximally entangled state |\u03a6kAB i :=\nk\n\u221a\nj=1 |j, ji and an n-qubit protocol for transforming |\u03c6AB i \u2297 |\u03a6AB i into\nk\nthe state |\u03c1AB i where F (\u03c8AB \u2297 \u03a6kAB , \u03c1AB ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb. By the monotonicity\nof the fidelity, it then follows that also F (\u03c8A \u2297 \u03a6kA , \u03c1A ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb, and thus,\n2\u03b1\nlog(1 \u2212 \u01eb). Using\naccording to lemma 4.5, S\u03b1 (\u03c1A ) \u2265 S\u03b2 (\u03c8A ) + log k + 1\u2212a\nk\nS\u03b1 (\u03c6A \u2297 \u03a6A ) = S\u03b1 (\u03c6A ) + log k, lemma 4.4 proves that the conversion from\n2\u03b1\nlog(1 \u2212 \u01eb) qubits\n\u03c6AB \u2297 \u03a6kAB to \u03c1AB requires at least S\u03b2 (\u03c8A ) \u2212 S\u03b1 (\u03c6A ) + 1\u2212\u03b1\nof communication, regardless of the dimension k.\n\u2737\nNote that the above proof relies critically on the fact that for the maximally\nentangled state S\u03b2 (\u03a6kA ) \u2212 S\u03b1 (\u03a6kA ) = 0, which does not hold for general states.\n\nProof\n1 Pk\n\n10\n\n\fIt should be pointed out that similar lower bounds can be derived from other\nother techniques from quantum information theory, such as those of Ref. [28].\nIn practice, however, the ease with which the R\u00e9nyi entropies are calculated\nand manipulated can result in significant simplification over approaches based\non majorization.\n\n5\n\nQuantum Lower Bounds on Communication\nComplexity\n\nIn this section will use our results on the complexity of state transformations to\nobtain similar lower bounds on the communication complexity of functions.\nDefinition 5.1 For a function f : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 {\u22121, +1} the rectangle Rf is\ndefined by Rxy := f (x, y) for all x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y . The two marginal density\n1\n1\nT\nY\nT\nmatrices of the function f are \u03c1X\nf := |X||Y | Rf Rf and \u03c1f := |X||Y | Rf Rf . The\neigenvalue spectrum \u03c3(f ) of f is the spectrum of the marginal density matrix\nY\nof f (the spectra of \u03c1X\nf and \u03c1f are the same).\nIt is easy to prove that the bipartite state\nX\n1\np\nf (x, y)|x, yi\n|X||Y | x\u2208X,y\u2208Y\n\n|\u03c8AB i =\n\n(13)\n\nY\nwill have marginal density matrices \u03c1X\nf and \u03c1f , and hence S\u03b2 (\u03c3(f )) = S\u03b2 (\u03c8A ) =\nS\u03b2 (\u03c8B ).\nThese definitions allow us to formulate the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 5.2 Let f : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 {\u22121, 1} be a distributed function. The com(\u2217)\nmunication complexity Q\u01eb (f ) is lower bounded by\nQ(\u2217)\n\u01eb (f )\n\n\u2265\n\n1\n2 S\u03b2 (\u03c3(f ))\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\u22121\n\nlog(1 \u2212 2\u01eb),\n\n(14)\n\nfor every \u03b2 > 1. This lower bound applies to the uniform distribution \u03bc(x, y) :=\n1/|X||Y | over the input values.\nProof\n\nWe know by lemma 2.4 that if we define \u03c6 and \u03c8 according to\n|\u03c6AB i =\n|\u03c8AB i =\n(\u2217)\n\n(\u2217)\n\nX\n1\np\n|xA i|yB i,\n|X||Y | x\u2208X,y\u2208Y\nX\n1\np\nf (x, y)|xA i|yB i,\n|X||Y | x\u2208X,y\u2208Y\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwe have Q\u01eb (f ) \u2265 12 Q\u03042\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ). Because \u03c6AB is a disentangled state with\nS\u03b1 (\u03c6A ) = 0 and S\u03b2 (\u03c8A ) = S\u03b2 (\u03c3(f )), we use theorem 4.6 to complete the proof.\n\u2737\n11\n\n\f5.1\n\nThe Inner Product Function\n\nAs an example, we will apply the lower bound of the previous section to determine the quantum communication complexity of the inner product function,\nwhich is defined for two n-bit strings x, y \u2208 {0, 1}n by\nIP(x, y) :=\n\nn\nX\n\nxi yi\n\n(mod 2).\n\n(17)\n\ni=1\n\n\u2217\nIn\n\u0006 n \u0007the exact case with prior entanglement, it has been shown that Q0 (IP) =\n[8]. The speedup of a factor of 2 is achieved using superdense coding,\n2\nwhich is applicable to every function. In the bounded-error case, however, the\nknown bounds are considerably weaker. In the same paper, the lower bound\nQ\u2217\u01eb (IP) \u2265 12 (1 \u2212 2\u01eb)2 n \u2212 21 , has a scaling factor in front of the linear term n that\ndepends on the error rate \u01eb. This is in sharp contrast with the lower bound for\nthe model where no prior entanglement is allowed [2]: Q\u01eb (IP) \u2265 n2 + log(1 \u2212 2\u01eb).\nHere we will generalize this inequality to the setting where A and B are\nallowed to use an arbitrary amount of EPR-pairs.\n\nTheorem 5.3 The EPR-enhanced communication complexity of the inner product function is bounded by\n\u0006\n\u0007\u0001\nn\n\u2264 Q\u01eb(\u2217) (IP) \u2264 max 0, n2 + 21 log(1 \u2212 2\u01eb) . (18)\n2 + log(1 \u2212 2\u01eb)\n\nThis result, we should emphasize, only holds if the entangled\nP state shared by\nAlice and Bob is restricted to be of the form |\u03a6k i = \u221a1k kj=1 |j, ji. In independent work, Nayak and Salzman, using a different technique than the one we\nhave employed here, have recently shown that the lower bound actually holds\nfor Q\u2217\u01eb (IP) as well [20].\nTo prove the lower bound we use our earlier theorem 5.2 in combination\nwith the knowlegde that the rectangle RIP is an orthogonal matrix such that\n1\n\u03c1X\nIP = 2n I. As a result, S\u03b2 (\u03c3(IP)) = n for all \u03b2 and the lower bound follows by\ntaking the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nFor the upper bound consider q qubits of communication used in a superdense coding scheme such that Alice can send Bob 2q bits of information about\nher n-bit input string. Bob can then guess the value of x on Alice's remaining\nn \u2212 2q bits, expecting to be correct with probability 22q\u2212n . On the occasions\nthat he has guessed correctly, he can evaluate IP without error, otherwise, he\ncan expect to be correct half the time. Therefore, the probability of success for\nthe resulting protocol will be 1 \u2212 \u01eb \u2265 22q\u2212n + 12 (1 \u2212 22q\u2212n ). Taking logarithms\nthen reveals that for this protocol: q \u2264 n2 + 12 log(1 \u2212 2\u01eb).\nObserve also that any protocol that uses prior entanglement and classical\ncommunication (with complexity measure C\u01eb\u2217 (IP)) can be simulated at half\nthe cost using superdense coding and that the optimal quantum protocol constructed here simply involves one-way communication from Alice to Bob. It\n(\u2217)\nfollows that C\u01eb\u2217 (IP) \u2265 2Q\u01eb (IP) = n + 2 log(1 \u2212 2\u01eb).\n12\n\n\f5.2\n\nLower Bound for a Promise Function\n\nConsider the distributed function g : Fq \u00d7 Fq \u2192 {\u22121, +1} that is defined for all\nx 6= y as the quadratic character of the difference between x and y \u2208 Fq :\n\u001a\n+1 if x \u2212 y is a square in Fq ,\ng(x, y) :=\n(19)\n\u22121 if x \u2212 y is not a square in Fq .\n(See [13] for the various properties of quadratic characters.) Here we will give an\n(\u2217)\nalmost tight lower bound on the communication complexity Q\u01eb of this function\nusing the R\u00e9nyi entropic methods of the previous sections.\nFirst we should note that g is not defined on all input pairs (x, y), which\nmeans that g is an example of a 'promise function'. Because of this, we cannot\ndirectly apply the lower bound method of theorem 5.2 as this assumes the\nuniform prior distribution over the input states. Instead, we will have to prove\n1\nour lower bound for the correlated distribution \u03bc(x, y) = q(q\u22121)\nfor x 6= y, and\n\u03bc(x, x) = 0. Fortunately this is possible with the help of theorem 4.6, which\ncan deal with initial entangled states \u03c6AB .\nTheorem 5.4 Let g : Fq \u00d7 Fq \u2192 {\u22121, +1} be the function defined in Equation 19. The EPR-enhanced communication complexity of this quadratic character function is bounded\nlog(q \u2212 1) \u2212 2 + 2 log(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n\n\u2264\n\nQ(\u2217)\n\u01eb (g)\n\n\u2264\n\n\u2308log(q)\u2309.\n\nSpecifically, the lower bound applies to the distribution: \u03bc(x, y) =\nx 6= y and \u03bc(x, x) = 0 over the q(q \u2212 1) input pairs (x, y).\n\n(20)\n1\nq(q\u22121)\n\nfor\n\nProof The upper bound is trivial: the set Fq has q elements, hence \u2308log q\u2309\nbits are sufficient for Bob to transmit the value of y to Alice.\nFor the lower bound, define the initial and final states \u03c6 and \u03c8\n|\u03c6AB i =\n|\u03c8AB i =\n\nX\n1\np\n|xA i|yB i,\nq(q \u2212 1) x6=y\u2208Fq\nX\n1\np\ng(x, y)|xA i|yB i.\nq(q \u2212 1) x6=y\u2208Fq\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nFor the quadratic character the following 'shift property' holds (see [13]):\n\u001a\nX\n\u22121 if s 6= r,\ng(x + r)g(x + s) =\n(23)\nq \u2212 1 if s = r.\nx\u2208Fq\n\nIt is thus not hard to see that the marginal density matrices of the two states\n1\n1\n[I + (q \u2212 2)J] and \u03c8A = q(q\u22121)\n[qI \u2212 J], where I is the qare \u03c6A = q(q\u22121)\ndimensional identity matrix, and J is the 'all ones' matrix of the same di1\n1\nmension. The respective spectra are thus \u03c3(\u03c6A ) = (1 \u2212 q1 , q(q\u22121)\n, . . . , q(q\u22121)\n)\n13\n\n\f1\n1\nand \u03c3(\u03c8A ) = ( q\u22121\n, . . . , q\u22121\n, 0). With this knowledge we can employ the lower\nbound of Theorem 4.6. For (\u03b1, \u03b2) = ( 12 , \u221e) the entropies of the two spectra\nare S\u221e (\u03c8A ) = log(q \u2212 1) and S1/2 (\u03c6A ) = log(4 \u2212 p4 ) < 2, and hence indeed\n(\u2217)\n\nQ\u0304\u01eb (\u03c8AB |\u03c6AB ) \u2265 log(q \u2212 1) \u2212 2 + 2 log(1 \u2212 \u01eb).\n\n\u2737\n\nAcknowledgments\nWvD is supported by an HP/MSRI postdoctoral fellowship, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Air Force Laboratory, Air\nForce Materiel Command, USAF, under agreement number F30602-01-2-0524.\nPH is supported by a Sherman Fairchild fellowship and US National Science\nFoundation grant no.
