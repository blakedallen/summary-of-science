(1985) have\nreached this conclusion comparing 60 \u03bcm fluxes with 6.3 cm fluxes from the Effelsberg dish,\nHelou et al. (1985) comparing 40\u2013120 \u03bcm fluxes with 21 cm fluxes from Westerbork. Although\nthe correlation is generally expressed between luminosities, it holds when they are normalized\nto cancel size and distance effects, and is valid for a very broad range of star formation\nrate densities (review by Condon (1992)). At centimeter wavelengths, the radio emission is\ndominated by non-thermal processes.\nAll models accounting for the constancy of the infrared to radio flux ratios invoke the\nstar formation process as the indirect source of both types of emission, via a production rate\nof cosmic rays by type-II supernovae proportional to the production rate of heating photons.\nAdditional coupling mechanisms are needed, such as between the interstellar medium density\nand the magnetic field intensity (Helou & Bicay 1993), or between the star formation rate and\nthe magnetic field amplification (Beck & Golla 1988; Niklas & Beck 1997). Various physical\nmechanisms can lead to these couplings, among which differential rotation, or turbulence\ndriven by massive star formation amplifying the magnetic field. In addition, given that\nthe various timescales involved in the underlying mechanisms are very different (heating\nof dust by massive and then intermediate-mass stars, explosion of supernovae, acceleration,\ndiffusion and decay of the relativistic electrons, variations of the magnetic field strength),\nsome variation in infrared to radio flux ratios with the star formation recent history is to be\nexpected.\nThere are naturally known exceptions to the general correlation. A fraction of galaxies\nhosting non-stellar nuclear activity have excess radio continuum emission, from cosmic rays\naccelerated in jets from the nucleus (Sopp & Alexander 1991; Roy et al. 1998). Star-forming\ngalaxies in cluster environments can also have radio excess (Miller & Owen 2001), perhaps\ntriggered by external magnetic field compression due to the intracluster gas pressure or to\ninteractions with neighbor galaxies. Two pairs of colliding galaxies with excess synchrotron\nemission originating from a bridge between the disks were studied by Condon et al. (1993) and\nCondon et al. (2002b), to illustrate the importance to the correlation of regulated cosmic ray\nescape. Hummel & Beck (1995) also discovered excess synchrotron in an interacting galaxy,\ndue to external compression of the magnetic field.\nSome statistical studies found high far-infrared to radio ratios in compact galaxy groups\n(Menon 1991) and in lenticular galaxies (Walsh et al. 1989), but may suffer from photometric\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nerrors (confusion problem for IRAS fluxes in galaxy groups, as pointed out by Sulentic & de\nMello Rabaca (1993), and extended radio emission missed by interferometric observations).\nFor dwarf galaxies, metallicity effects can lower the dust emission, and the radio spectra\nof many are dominated by thermal emission. Wunderlich & Klein (1988) found that the\nfar-infrared to radio ratio tends to be lower in blue compact galaxies than in spirals, while\nKlein et al. (1991) found similar ratios in both. Using the radio fluxes of Klein et al. (1991)\nand new IRAS fluxes measured with Scanpi (Helou et al. 1988), it seems in fact that there\nis a continuum of infrared to radio ratios from very low to very high values, i.e. with a much\nlarger dispersion than in spirals, perhaps depending on two competing effects: reduction of\nthe dust emission by metal deficiency, and reduction of the synchrotron emission by a lack\nof supernovae or by fast escape of cosmic rays.\nVariations also exist inside spiral galaxies: Beck & Golla (1988) found higher 60 \u03bcm\nto 11 cm flux ratios in the central regions of large angular size spirals than in their disks,\nfollowing the F60 /F100 ratio, an average dust temperature indicator. This is likely because\nthe scale length of the synchrotron emission is larger than in the infrared, due to cosmic ray\npropagation far from the site of their acceleration, located in star formation regions hosting\nhot dust (Bicay & Helou 1990; Marsh & Helou 1995).\nIn this paper, we study three nearby galaxies (an amorphous galaxy, an early-type\nspiral and a late-type spiral) which are strongly deficient in radio emission with respect to\ntheir dust emission, trying to identify the cause of their peculiarity. In normal galaxies,\nthe synchrotron radiation comes mainly from electrons having left the supernova remnants\nwhich have accelerated them, and propagating in the interstellar magnetic field (Condon &\nYin 1990). A lack of synchrotron emission may thus have its origin in either an unusually\nlow strength of the magnetic field, or a reduced supernova rate in the recent past. With\nnon-detections in the synchrotron emission, the magnetic field strength is extremely difficult\nto estimate. However, we address the star formation properties using an array of new\nobservations, and thereby approach indirectly the issue of magnetic fields. We will argue\nthat these galaxies have a high star formation rate associated with a low supernova rate,\nreflecting a starburst in a very early stage occurring after a long period of quiescence, since\nsupernovae begin to explode a few Myr after the birth of their progenitors.\nIf this interpretation is valid, these galaxies could provide the opportunity to observe\nthe properties of the earliest stages of a starburst, and to understand better the regulation\nof the galactic infrared and radio emission. Although such galaxies are apparently quite\nrare, they may exist in greater numbers at more primitive epochs of star formation. They\nmust therefore be taken into account when using high-redshift radio surveys to study the\nstar formation history, and when using high-resolution radio observations to identify faint\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ninfrared or submillimeter sources.\nThe paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we discuss existing data and assemble\ncomprehensive information about NGC 1377, IC 1953 and NGC 4491; Section 3 presents\nand analyses new radio continuum observations; in Section 4 we describe and exploit nearinfrared spectroscopic observations, extract estimates of the star formation rate from the\ndust emission and discuss the excitation and apparent cooling rate of the interstellar medium;\nSection 5 examines results from single-dish molecular gas observations in NGC 1377; Section 6\nis a brief discussion of some common properties of NGC 4418 with the three galaxies studied\nabove; Section 7 lists and discusses the various physical scenarios which could account for\nthe observed synchrotron deficiency. These scenarios are related either to a very low cosmic\nray density stemming from a low supernova rate, or to a very low magnetic field intensity; we\nconclude in favor of the former, as would be expected in a nascent starburst. Section 8 then\ncompares the statistics of synchrotron-deficient galaxies to those of nascent starbursts, and\ndiscusses possible triggering mechanisms. Section 9 contains a summary of our conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nDescriptive review of the galaxies\n\nGeneral information about the three galaxies under consideration can be found in Table 1. NGC 1377 and IC 1953 were identified as radio synchrotron-deficient galaxies among\nthe IRAS bright galaxy sample mapped with the VLA (Condon et al. 1990). NGC 4491,\nwhich is fainter, was also found to be synchrotron-deficient in a search among the small\nsample of Roussel et al. (2001b), based on mid-infrared colors (see Sect. 2.4). All three\ngalaxies are low-mass and quite unremarkable at first sight, if it were not for their high dust\ntemperatures. Being both faint and hot in their dust emission, they are very peculiar with\nrespect to the average local LFIR \u2013F60 /F100 function, especially NGC 1377 (Chapman et al.\n2002). The average F60 /F100 ratio at their infrared luminosities is only \u2248 0.4, and they deviate from this by about 10\u03c3 and 5\u03c3. Although IC 1953 seems to have a very close companion\n(Fig. 1), this galaxy is at much higher redshift (see Section 2.2).\n\n2.1.\n\nMorphology\n\nNGC 1377 is classified as a lenticular or amorphous galaxy, and does not present any\napparent disturbance. Its only peculiarity, noted by Heisler & Vader (1994), is a central dust\nlane along the southern part of the minor axis, visible in the B-band isophotes. NGC 4491\nis a barred dwarf Sa galaxy (Binggeli & Cameron 1983) whose shape is also regular, with\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\na tenuous outer disk. IC 1953 is a strongly barred Sd galaxy (the bar is short but straight\nand narrow, connecting at right angles to the spiral arms). It has an unsually bright and\nwell-defined core for its late type (very prominent in the mid-infrared dust emission). One\nof the arms winds to join the opposite end of the bar, and the other arm, winding for more\nthan 360\u25e6, offers the aspect of three distinct branches.\nThe mid-infrared emission of NGC 1377 and NGC 4491, in the ISOCAM maps at 7 \u03bcm\nand 15 \u03bcm, is dominated by the central regions, of apparent sizes respectively about 2.3 kpc\nand 800 pc, and the dust emission of IC 1953 is also more concentrated (in a 1.5 kpc region) than in other galaxies of its late-type morphology (Fig. 1). Decomposing the surface\nbrightness profile of NGC 1377 at 7 \u03bcm, we find an unresolved source (at the resolution of\nISOCAM, with a point spread function of FWHM = 5.7\u2032\u2032 ) contributing about 60% of the\ntotal flux or more. For NGC 4491, the central region is also unresolved in the mid-infrared,\nand superimposed onto a very diffuse component. The 7 \u03bcm brightness profile decomposition\nyields a point source accounting for about 65% of the flux of the infrared core, and 38% of\nthe total flux. An unresolved source is also seen in the 7 \u03bcm brightness profile of IC 1953,\ncontaining about 65% of the flux of the circumnuclear regions.\n\n2.2.\n\nEnvironment\n\nNGC 1377 and IC 1953 are both members of the Eridanus galaxy group. According to\nWillmer et al. (1989), this is a small group (54 members brighter than B = 14.5) in a young\ndynamical state, since it has an irregular and subclustered aspect, is rich in spiral galaxies,\nand forms with the Fornax cluster a bound system which is not yet virialized. In the soft\nX-ray maps of Burrows et al. (1993) (0.1\u20130.9 keV), Eridanus is not detected. NGC 1377 and\nIC 1953 do not belong to any subcondensation, but to the same loose sub-group lying in\nprojection in the center, and are close to each other both spatially and in radial velocity.\nNGC 4491 seems also to be part of a dynamically young system, the core named group\nA in the Virgo cluster, containing M 87 and 100 to 300 members, and which is described by\nBinggeli et al. (1993) as a \"turbulent core with a long tail of low velocities\". NGC 4491 belongs to this tail, with a large velocity with respect to the systemic velocity of \u2248 \u2212550 km s\u22121 .\nNone of the three galaxies shows any morphological disturbance, but they have likely\ninteracted with the ambiant medium, since they are deficient in atomic gas. We did not find\nany published HI mass measurement for NGC 1377, but a spectrum from the HIPASS survey,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nconducted with the Parkes telescope (Barnes et al. 2001).2 This spectrum has a sensitivity\nof about 10 mJy per spectral channel, and implies that M(HI) < 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Compared\nwith the S0/a-Sab galaxies in Guiderdoni & Rocca (1985), the logarithmic HI deficiency of\nNGC 1377, normalized by the dispersion in the field reference sample, is higher than 1.0 .\nThis value is def = 1.34 for IC 1953 and def > 1.73 for NGC 4491 (Roussel et al. 2001b),\nand a galaxy can be considered HI-deficient when def > 1.2.\nIC 1953 has two small-mass neighbors, ESO 548-G040, a very low-surface brightness\ngalaxy at about 2.6 arcmin in projected distance to the NW, and ESO 548-G036, at about 6\narcmin to the SE. ESO 548-G040 has a much higher receding velocity (4061 km s\u22121 ) than the\nmembers of the Eridanus group (\u2248 1600 km s\u22121 ), and is therefore most likely a background\ngalaxy. On the contrary, the velocity of ESO 548-G036 (1480 km s\u22121 ) identifies it as a true\nneighbor of IC 1953, with a velocity difference of 400 km s\u22121 and a physical distance \u2265 36 kpc.\nIt is thus tempting to consider ESO 548-G036 a candidate for tidal interaction with IC 1953,\nwhich could be responsible for the peculiar arm structure of IC 1953.\nThe closest neighbor to NGC 4491 is the blue compact dwarf IC 3446 at 6.3 arcmin to\nthe W, and the closest galaxy of comparable mass is NGC 4497, at about 12 arcmin to the\nNW. Their velocities are 760 and 610 km s\u22121 larger than that of NGC 4491.\n\n2.3.\n\nFar-infrared and radio properties\n\nIn order to build a reference for far-infrared to radio flux ratios, obtained with homogeneous IRAS and VLA data, we chose the sample of 69 nearby spiral galaxies studied by\nRoussel et al. (2001b), with mid-infrared and other data already at hand, and which comprises two of the three galaxies examined here, NGC 4491 and IC 1953. We measured IRAS\nfluxes using the Scanpi tool (Helou et al. 1988) with default parameters. Only for NGC 4491\nat 100 \u03bcm was the baseline fitted over a 30\u2032 range replaced by a baseline fitted over the\ncentral 14\u2032 only, where it is reasonably flat. Given the brightness of the three target galaxies,\nwe used as a flux estimator for them the template amplitude, except for IC 1953 which is\nslightly extended at 25 and 60 \u03bcm (we used the flux integration of the scan between the first\nzero crossings). Radio continuum fluxes or upper limits at 21 cm were measured from NVSS\nmaps (Condon et al. 1998), with a beam FWHM of 45\u2032\u2032 and a detection limit of the order\nof 1 mJy. We obtain an upper limit for NGC 1377 which is equal to that given by the more\n2\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/multibeam/release/. The Parkes telescope is part of the Australia\nTelescope which is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed\nby CSIRO.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsensitive survey of Condon et al. (1990) in a 21\u2032\u2032 -beam.\nHelou et al. (1985) defined a logarithmic ratio of far-infrared to radio flux densities as:\nq = log [1.26 \u00d7 (2.58 F60 + F100 ) / 3.75 (THz) / S(21 cm)], where all flux densities, F60 , F100\nand S(21 cm), are expressed in the same unit. In the reference sample, excluding radio upper\nand lower limits, we find an average ratio q\u0304 = 2.34 \u00b1 0.19. The dispersion is the same as\nthat obtained by Condon et al. (1991a) for the IRAS bright galaxy sample. The relationship\nbetween far-infrared and 21 cm fluxes, both normalized by the flux or the flux density in\nthe blue band, is shown in Fig. 2. Five galaxies turn out to have far-infrared to radio flux\nratios q > q\u0304 + 3\u03c3: NGC 1377 (8.1\u03c3), NGC 4491 (5.5\u03c3) and IC 1953 (3.2\u03c3), with far-infrared\nto blue luminosity ratios higher than 1.5; NGC 4580 (3.9\u03c3) and NGC 4394 (3.2\u03c3), two Virgo\ngalaxies having LFIR /LB < 0.25. The latter two are most clearly separated from the first\nthree by their average dust temperature (Fig. 3): they have F60 /F100 of respectively 0.26\nand 0.23, and also low mid-infrared colors F15 /F7 of 0.9 to 1, whereas NGC 4491 and IC 1953\nhave F60 /F100 = 0.8, and the flux density spectrum of NGC 1377 peaks at 60 \u03bcm.\nThe lack of radio synchrotron emission can be accounted for easily in the cool-dust\ngalaxies. If their star formation rate is presently very low, as indicated by their dust emission\nproperties (low colors and low surface brightnesses), then the far-infrared-emitting dust can\nbe expected to be heated mainly by low-mass stars, well in excess of the emission produced\nby the star formation activity. After the production of cosmic rays has ceased, the timescale\nfor synchrotron emission decay is less than 108 years (Condon 1992), so that the q ratio\nshould increase on this timescale after an exhaustion of the star formation. The whole disk\nof NGC 4394 is extremely diffuse in H\u03b1 (Koopmann et al. 2001) and in the mid-infrared\nas well (Roussel et al. 2001a). This is true also of NGC 4580 outside its inner pseudo-ring.\nHowever, the high F60 /F100 ratios of NGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953 exclude such an\nexplanation for their lack of synchrotron emission.\nThe correlation between far-infrared and radio continuum luminosities is known to be\nnon-linear, the radio emission rising faster or decreasing faster than the dust emission (Devereux & Eales 1989). Faint galaxies such as those studied here are thus expected to have\nhigher q ratios than brighter galaxies. However, Hummel et al. (1988) found evidence of\na small decrease of F100 /S(20 cm) when the average dust temperature F60 /F100 rises, along\nwith an increase of the radio brightness temperature. To linearize and tighten the relationship between infrared and radio fluxes, Condon et al. (1991a) apply an empirical correction\nwhich assumes that the radio emission is a good measure of the star formation rate, and\ndecreases the q ratio in proportion to qb = FB /S(20 cm), the blue to radio flux ratio. Although they find that variations in F60 /F100 cannot account for the dispersion in q, F60 /F100\nis correlated with qb , and the trend of decreasing q with increasing F60 /F100 exists in our\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsample also (particularly illustrated in Fig. 3 by the behavior of NGC 4580 and NGC 4394).\nNGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953 manifestly break this trend. If we apply the correction\nof Condon et al. (1991a) to our data, as shown in Fig. 4, then the peculiarity of NGC 1377,\nNGC 4491 and IC 1953 with respect to the other galaxies is not destroyed: they still lie at\n5.9\u03c3, 3.6\u03c3 and 2.4\u03c3 above the new mean qc = 2.22 \u00b1 0.18. The only other galaxy having\nqc > q\u0304c + 2\u03c3 is NGC 1022 (qc = q\u0304c + 2.5\u03c3), an amorphous starburst with F60 /F100 = 0.76. We\nnote that the correction proposed by Devereux & Eales (1989), based on the blue to infrared\nluminosity ratio, cannot be appropriate, since q as a function of LB /LFIR shows no defined\ntrend.\nThe high F60 /F100 and low F12 /F25 ratios signal the existence of a dust component with\nhigh temperatures and thus high heating intensities, which could be due to an extensive star\nformation burst or non-stellar activity, or both (Helou 1986). In this respect, the spectral\nindices between 25 and 60 \u03bcm of NGC 1377 and NGC 4491, -1.5 and -2.1, are ambiguous (de\nGrijp et al. 1987).\n\n2.4.\n\nSpectral energy distribution and power source\n\nThe broadband spectral energy distributions of the three galaxies are shown in Fig. 5.\nJ, H and Ks-band fluxes are derived from images built for the 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas\n(Jarrett et al. 2003), with a preliminary photometric calibration valid for the CIT system.\nThe U, V and I-band fluxes of NGC 1377 come from the colors given by Heisler & Vader\n(1994). Other optical data were found in the NED database. We measured the 4\u20135 \u03bcm fluxes\nof NGC 1377 and IC 1953 in ISOCAM maps.\nIt appears that the dust emission spectrum of NGC 1377 cannot be reproduced by any\nempirical SED of Dale et al. (2001) (Fig. 5), ajusted to a sample of normal galaxies, and\nparametrized by the F60 /F100 ratio (note however that the color bin of NGC 1377 comprises\nonly two galaxies). The emission from transiently-heated dust particles, from 7 to 25 \u03bcm,\nis well in excess of what is expected for the large grain temperature (as estimated by the\nF60 /F100 ratio), by up to 8\u20139\u03c3. L7 /LFIR is expected to decrease steadily with rising dust\ntemperature, and then starts to increase again at the highest F60 /F100 ratios, but NGC 1377\noverdevelops this trend (Fig. 6). For F15 /FFIR , which in normal galaxies shows less dispersion\nthan F7 /FFIR , the same remark applies.\nThe mid-infrared spectral shape between 2.5 and 11 \u03bcm, observed with ISOPHOT in\n24 \u00d7 24\u2032\u2032 Laureijs et al. (2000), is quite unusual: instead of the typical spectrum of aromatic\nbands observed in most star-forming galaxies (Helou et al. 2000), a broad asymmetric feature\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nbetween 6 and 8.5 \u03bcm contributes the bulk of the emission. This is reminiscent of some\nultraluminous galaxies (Rigopoulou et al. 1999; Tran et al. 2001). Such a broad feature,\naccompanied by very weak 6.2 and 11.3 \u03bcm bands, is also observed in the peak E of the\nSMC HII region N 66 by Contursi et al. (2000), in proto-planetary nebulae (Kwok et al.\n2001), and bears some resemblance with the signature of anthracite, used by Guillois et\nal. (1996) to reproduce proto-planetary nebula spectra. All this suggests that the aromatic\nband carriers have not been processed in the same way as in normal star-forming galaxies,\nand that the dust responsible for the emission is subjected to hard radiation. Since it\ncontributes the same part in the infrared energy budget as in quiescent galaxies, this dust\nmust be more resilient in order not to be destroyed. The abrupt fall-off of the spectrum from\n9 to 11 \u03bcm further suggests that the absorption by silicates may be substantial, but such\nan interpretation is very hazardous, because optically-thin spectra of normal galaxies also\nhave a minimum in this region. Dust heating cannot be provided by a shock, in particular\nbecause one would then observe either a prominent silicate emission feature, or a negligible\nmid-infrared emission with respect to the far-infrared emission, depending on the gas density\n(Draine 1981; Dwek et al. 1996).\nLaureijs et al. (2000), on the basis of this spectrum, propose that NGC 1377 contains a\nburied Seyfert nucleus. However, several arguments suggest otherwise:\n1) The continuum emission at 3\u20134 \u03bcm and 9\u201311 \u03bcm is near zero, contrary to what is observed\nin Seyfert nuclei. The short-wavelength continuum, in particular, which is not affected as\nmuch by extinction, is now routinely used as a diagnostic of the contribution of an active nucleus to the energy budget (Genzel et al. 1998; Laurent et al. 2000). Among the\nsample of Laureijs et al. (2000), the spectrum of NGC 1377 resembles much more that of\nIRAS 02530+0211, a galaxy of starburst type, than that of any of the Seyfert galaxies. One\ncould argue that the broad feature seen between 6 and 8.5 \u03bcm is similar to that seen in Centaurus A (Laurent et al. 2000), and is produced by a continuum strongly absorbed longward\nof 8 \u03bcm by silicates; however, the similarity is superficial, since the spectra of Centaurus A\nand other Seyfert nuclei rise steeply longward of 10 \u03bcm and are brighter at 11.5 \u03bcm than at\n8 \u03bcm, whereas the 11.5 \u03bcm flux of NGC 1377 is near zero. This is a strong argument against\npure silicate absorption, because the red wing of the absorption band would otherwise be\nexceptionally wide. Trying a quantitative fit of the 8 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm data, with the extinction law of Draine & Lee (1984) (some variants exist, but introduce differences essentially\nshortward of 8 \u03bcm, which is why we exclude short wavelengths), AV \u2248 70 is required in\norder to reproduce the 8\u201310 \u03bcm ISOPHOT spectrum with an absorbed dust continuum, but\nno good fit can be performed: the solution is too high in the 10\u201311.5 \u03bcm range; one can\nobtain a simultaneous fit of the 12 \u03bcm, 25 \u03bcm, 60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm data with the sum of two\nblackbodies of 370 K and 100 K, but the fit at 15 \u03bcm is then much higher than the observed\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nflux, which is impossible to fix by adding a new dust component. We thus conclude that the\nbroad feature between 6 and 8.5 \u03bcm may contain a genuine emission band, and may not be\nexclusively caused by absorption3 .\n2) The J, H and K-band surface brightness profiles computed by Heisler et al. (1996) are\nnearly flat inside the central 3\u20134\u2032\u2032 , significantly below the best r 1/4 fit, whereas most Seyfert\ngalaxies with F60 > F100 require an extra nuclear point source. A high central absorption\ncould flatten the profiles, but this is unlikely, because 2MASS data indicate that the J-H and\nH-K colors of the central 10\u2032\u2032 are not different from the global colors within the error bars.\nH-K is relatively \"blue\" compared to the other galaxies in Heisler et al. (1996), and J-K\nis very blue compared to the ultraluminous galaxies in Klaas et al. (2001) (like the bluest\nstarbursts and Liners), or to the 2MASS extended sources brighter than Ks = 14 (Jarrett\n2000; Jarrett et al. 2003). The power emitted by dust between 4.5 and 100 \u03bcm is only 1.8\ntimes the total stellar power between 3600\u00c5 and 4.5 \u03bcm, and about twice more considering\nthe center alone. This means that the luminosity-weighted extinction cannot be high enough\nto hide a deep stellar potential well.\n3) Seyfert galaxies either emit excess radio emission with respect to their infrared emission,\nor follow the same correlation as normal galaxies (Sopp & Alexander 1991). Although no\nstarburst galaxy is known to be as radio-deficient as NGC 1377, no active nucleus either has\nbeen shown to be synchrotron-deficient so far. X-ray data would be useful to rule out Seyfert\nactivity, but to our knowledge, none exist for NGC 1377.\nThe 7 to 25 \u03bcm emission of NGC 4491 is somewhat in excess of the corresponding SED of\nDale et al. (2001), but not significantly. The blue-band surface brightness profile of Kodaira\net al. (1986) is exponential, with no central peak, and so are the near-infrared profiles. The\nJ-H and H-K colors are close to those of NGC 1377, and the color differences between the\ncircumnuclear region and the whole galaxy are small. The same conclusions thus apply.\nAs to IC 1953, only the 7 \u03bcm emission is 2 \u03c3 in excess of the average empirical SED. Its\nglobal near-infrared colors are extremely blue, and its circumnuclear colors are slightly bluer\nthan those of NGC 1377 and NGC 4491. Since the disk infrared emission in IC 1953 is significant, and well resolved in ISOCAM maps, we decomposed the spectral energy distribution\ninto a disk component and a circumnuclear region (CNR) component, which we identify to\n3\n\nNote that if AV = 70 is adopted, then the emission of hot small grains up to \u2248 25 \u03bcm would have to\nbe boosted by a factor five to obtain the intrinsic small grain luminosity. Since the complementary power\nobserved in the far-infrared is only 1.2 times the observed power of small grains, at least 3LFIR would have\nto be re-emitted at longer wavelengths, in the submillimeter, which is inconceivable. And this would only\nexacerbate the difficulty to account for the dust luminosity of NGC 1377 in the total absence of activity in\nthe radio window (this will be developed in Sect. 7.5).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe core with a high F15 /F7 ratio. To do this, we estimated typical disk infrared colors using\nthe ISOCAM and IRAS fluxes of NGC 4027 (Roussel et al. 2001a), which has high signal\nto noise ratios and whose entire body can be assimilated to a disk: F15 /F7 = 0.87 (the\nsmall 7 \u03bcm excess in the disk of IC 1953 being ascribed to stellar emission), F12 /F7 = 0.85,\nF25 /F7 = 1.37, F60 /F7 = 13.2 and F100 /F7 = 37.7 . The result, shown in Fig. 5d, outlines the\nfact that part of the peculiarity of IC 1953 is hidden by normal disk properties: the center\nhas hotter dust and higher infrared to optical ratios than the galaxy as a whole. The radio\ndeficiency is likely more severe in the center; using the radio measurement of Condon et al.\n(1990) inside 21\u2032\u2032 and the above decomposition, we obtain qCNR = 3.44 = q\u0304 + 5.7\u03c3.\nThe position of a galaxy in a mid-infrared surface brightness\u2013color diagram (\u03a3(15 \u03bcm)\nversus F15 /F7 ) can give some sense of the relative contribution of stellar populations of different ages, on a timescale of several 108 years, in the dust heating (Roussel et al. 2001b). The\ncircumnuclear regions of NGC 4491 and IC 1953 populate a part of the diagram otherwise\nempty4 , and have a central F15 /F7 color more than twice the average value corresponding\nto their surface brightness. This is fully consistent with the hypothesis that they are undergoing a starburst in an early phase, which is massive with respect to the mass of the\nunderlying intermediate stellar population. As for NGC 1377, its F15 /F7 excess is only moderate. However, the emission in the 7 \u03bcm bandpass being due to an unusual dust species,\nthe interpretation of its F15 /F7 color is not straightforward.\n\n3.\n\nMulti-wavelength radio continuum\n\nWe mapped the galaxies with the Effelsberg 100 m antenna5 , at 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm, during\nsix observation sessions between April and August 2002. These observations made use of the\n4850 MHz HEMT dual-horn receiver (30 K system temperature, 500 MHz bandwidth) and\nthe 8350 MHz HEMT single-horn receiver (25 K system temperature, 1100 MHz bandwidth),\nboth installed in the secondary focus of the telescope. The beamwidths are 147\u2032\u2032 at 6.2 cm\nand 82\u2032\u2032 at 3.6 cm, thus comparable to the galactic disk sizes. Between 10 and 20 coverages\nper galaxy were obtained, scanned in azimuthal direction at 6.2 cm and in right ascension and\ndeclination, alternatively, at 3.6 cm. 3C138 and 3C286 were used as flux calibration sources.\nThe data reduction was performed using the NOD2 software package. The coverages were\n4\n\nThe only other galaxies in the same part of the diagram are NGC 4388, a Seyfert galaxy, and NGC 4519,\na galaxy akin to IC 1953 in many respects, but whose peculiar central regions may be diluted in the emission\nof its bright disk.\n5\n\nThe Effelsberg telescope is operated by the MPIfR Bonn on behalf of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft e.V.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncombined by applying the \"basket-weaving\" technique (Emerson & Gr\u00e4ve 1988). The final\n3.6 cm maps were smoothed to a beamwidth of 90\u2032\u2032 to increase the signal to noise ratio.\nThe measured flux densities are contained in Table 4 and the contour maps shown in\nFig. 7. Significantly polarized emission was not detected in any galaxy. Figure 8 compares the\nradio measurements with the free-free and synchrotron spectra of normal galaxies matched\nto the far-infrared fluxes of NGC 1377, IC 1953 and NGC 4491. The total flux expected at\n21 cm was derived from the average q ratio, the free-free component from the ionizing photon\nflux estimate (assuming Te = 5000 K), and we adopted the spectral indices Ssync \u221d \u03bd \u22120.75\nand Sff \u221d \u03bd \u22120.1 , unless otherwise constrained for the synchrotron component.\n\n3.1.\n\nNGC 1377\n\nNGC 1377 is not detected at any radio frequency, and the upper limits even lie below\nfluxes expected from a mere free-free component matched to the ionizing photon flux derived\nfrom the dust emission (Fig. 8). This fact suggests to us not only that NGC 1377 is mostly\ndevoid of synchrotron radiation, but also that the star formation episode is so young that\nmost massive stars are still embedded in their parent molecular clouds, which would cause\na large fraction of the ionizing photons to be intercepted by dust before being able to ionize\nthe gas. NGC 1377 was reobserved in 1990 at 3.55 cm with the VLA in the A configuration,\nyielding a beam of 0.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.25\u2032\u2032 (J.J. Condon, unpublished). The galaxy is still undetected\nat this high resolution, and the 3\u03c3 upper limit is 0.13 mJy per beam, i.e. 15 times less than\nthe 3.6 cm upper limit from Effelsberg. Interpreting this limit, we have to take into account\nthe possibility that the star-forming region be more extended than 0.3\u2032\u2032 . Assuming a size of\n100 pc or \u2248 1\u2032\u2032 (see the next to last paragraph in this section), the equivalent upper limit on\nthe total 3.55 cm flux is of the order of 1.3 mJy. Vader et al. (1993) derive from a \"snapshot\"\nobservation with the VLA S(6 cm) < 0.9 mJy for NGC 1377, in a 4\u2032\u2032 -beam, which brings a\nstronger constraint. In such conditions, the data require a reduction of ionizing photons by\nabout 70% or more (also by 70% using instead the 21 cm upper limit). If we adopt the limit\nin a 0.3\u2032\u2032 -beam, then the ionizing photons have to be suppressed by more than 95%. If indeed\na larger fraction than usual of the ionizing photons are absorbed by dust in NGC 1377, then\nthis will have the simultaneous effect of decreasing the free-free emission and enhancing the\ninfrared emission, with respect to a normal galaxy with the same star formation rate.\nThermal opacity is an alternative explanation for the non-detection of the free-free\nemission. The upper limit at 3.55 cm however places very stringent a constraint in this case:\nwith S(3.55 cm) < 1.3 mJy, the effective opacity is \u03c4 (3.6 cm) > 0.83, or \u03c4 (21 cm) > 31.\nAssuming a simple geometry and uniform electronic density, such a value would imply that\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe scale of the emitting region be less than 28 pc, and the electronic density higher than\n2700 cm\u22123 . Since this is unrealistic, the free-free opacity explanation is dismissed.\nAssuming a normal initial mass function and no dust emission excess, the starburst must\nhave produced approximately 104 O stars (see Section 4.2). Assuming that the dust emission\nat 60 and 100 \u03bcm is due to a pure blackbody of temperature 80 K (which fits the 25 to 100 \u03bcm\ndata with only a small observed excess of 25% at 25 \u03bcm), its diameter is about 37 pc. Using\nthe model of D\u00e9sert et al. (1990) for O5 stars, the size of the starburst region is rather of the\norder of 100 pc (1\u2032\u2032 ) or larger. The emission region may thus be truly more extended than\nthe VLA A-configuration beam. To trigger star formation quasi-instantaneously over such\na scale perhaps needs a merger with a satellite galaxy, which does not necessarily produce\nmorphological disturbances, but should be visible in the gas kinematics.\nThe dust mass required to produce the observed far-infrared emission is \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 ,\naccording to the dust emissivity derived by Bianchi et al. (1999) for the Galaxy, with Tdust =\n54 K (which produces an emission excess from small dust grains of 76% at 25 \u03bcm). Using\ninstead a blackbody fit, only 4.0 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 of dust are needed. Assuming that the gas to\ndust mass ratio is similar to the Galactic value of \u2248 100 (Sodroski et al. 1994), the gas mass\nassociated with the starburst in NGC 1377 is then of the order of 4\u00d7106 to 3\u00d7107 M\u2299 , which\nrepresents much less than 10% of the observed stellar mass in the whole central region. Since\nthis mass ratio is reasonable, the hypothesis that the dust is heated by a starburst is plausible,\nbut still needs to be confirmed by observations of the molecular gas: see Section 5. The upper\nlimit on the atomic gas mass, M(HI) < 2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (Section 2.2), is not in contradiction with\nthe starburst hypothesis. We will discuss the possibility that a radio-quiet active nucleus\nheats the dust in Section 7.5.\n\n3.2.\n\nIC 1953\n\nThe entire radio spectrum lies well below a normal synchrotron spectrum, but contrary\nto NGC 1377, it is higher than the expected free-free component alone. At 21 cm, Condon et\nal. (1990) measure a flux density of \u2248 2 \u2212 3 mJy inside a 21\u2032\u2032 -beam, which is a bit larger than\nthe size of the circumnuclear regions seen in the mid-infrared. This value is consistent with\nthe free-free emission derived from the infrared spectrum of the central regions. As explained\nin Section 2.4, we performed a decomposition of the infrared spectral energy distribution into\ndisk and circumnuclear (CNR) components, based on an empirical color model and on the\ntrue distribution observed at 7 and 15 \u03bcm. This allows us to estimate the free-free and\nsynchrotron emission separately for the disk and the galactic center, as shown in Fig. 8 (note\nthat no component has been tuned in any way to the radio data in this graphic).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe central regions thus appear almost devoid of any synchrotron emission; otherwise,\nthe 21\u2032\u2032 measurement would be higher. This finds support in the total flux densities at\n21 cm, 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm being in agreement with the synchrotron radiation derived for the\ndisk alone (with a reasonable spectral index assumed for illustration purposes to be -0.75).\nExtremely diffuse extended emission from the disk is detected at all three wavelengths. The\n3.6 cm map contains extentions to the south, which do not correspond to any structure at\nother wavelengths and are thus suspect; if the flux measurement is limited to the beam\narea rather than the total extention, however, then one obtains 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 mJy instead of\n3.6 \u00b1 2.2 mJy. The data therefore are consistent with free-free emission and disk synchrotron\nemission, but not with the central synchrotron component expected from a normal supernova\nrate. One may question this result, since a minimum level of emission would be produced\nby cosmic rays originating in the disk and diffusing into the central region. In 107 years,\ncosmic rays may propagate to about 1 kpc from their source, using a diffusion coefficient\nof a few 1024 m2 s\u22121 , as found by e.g. Strong (1977) and Wallace (1980) in the Galaxy.\nScaling the disk synchrotron brightness, which is very low, by a reasonably large size of 5\u2032\u2032\nfor the starburst, and by an increase of the magnetic field strength from 10 \u03bcG to 50 \u03bcG (see\nSection 7.3 for a justification of these numbers), we estimate the synchrotron emission from\ndisk cosmic rays to be at most of the same order as the free-free emission within the central\nregion, even at 20 cm. Furthermore, if the central magnetic field is much larger than the disk\nmagnetic field, then it will reflect cosmic rays coming from the disk (Fermi 1954).\nIC 1953 was reobserved at 3.55 cm with the VLA in the A configuration (0.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.25\u2032\u2032\nbeam). The detected flux is 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 mJy, and the size of the emitting region of the order\nof 0.17\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.09\u2032\u2032 , with a position angle of 11\u25e6 (J.J. Condon, unpublished). This compact\ncomponent accounts for less than half the peak flux density measured at 3.6 cm with the\nEffelsberg antenna, which is 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 mJy. It is consistent with normal free-free emission\nprovided that about 65% of the flux comes from a region larger than 0.3\u2032\u2032 , i.e. 30 pc, which\nis very likely, since the lower limit on the size of the starburst, obtained for a blackbody of\n70 K matched to the CNR far-infrared emission, is 46 pc.\n\n3.3.\n\nNGC 4491\n\nOnly for NGC 4491 does a flux measurement at another radio wavelength exist. Niklas\net al. (1995) measured S(2.8 cm) = 5 \u00b1 1 mJy, with the Effelsberg telescope, in a 69\u2032\u2032beam. Since the observed flux density at 3.6 cm in NGC 4491 (5.0 \u00b1 0.3 mJy), confirming the\nmeasurement of Niklas et al. (1995) at 2.8 cm, is in good agreement with what is expected\nfrom the spectra of normal galaxies (4.9 mJy for a non-thermal index of -0.75 between 3.6 cm\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nand 21 cm), and the free-free emission can contribute only of the order of 20% of the total\nemission at this wavelength, we have evidence that NGC 4491 produces synchrotron emission.\nHowever, this emission seems to vanish at 21 cm: the NVSS map indicates that S(20 cm) <\n1.35 mJy. NGC 4491 was not detected either in the (much less sensitive) 12.6 cm survey\nof Dressel & Condon (1978). Source confusion could be responsible for this inconsistency.\nUsing the 8.4 GHz source counts of Fomalont et al. (2002), which indicate 9 \u00d7 10\u22124 < N(S >\n4 mJy)(arcmin\u22122 ) < 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , and a beam of 80\u2032\u2032 , the probability of observing a confusing\nsource at 3.6 cm lies between 1/360 and 1/800. Given that the radio positions at 3.6 cm and\n6.2 cm are in good agreement with the optical center, as well as the position at 6.2 cm of a\nbright quasar seen to the SW in the NVSS map, and that the observed flux coincides with\nthe flux expected from the infrared emission, confusion is unlikely.\nAs NGC 4491 lies only 54.5\u2032 away from M 87, which emits about 220 Jy at 20 cm, it\nis possible that the NVSS map does not retrieve the correct flux density of NGC 4491,\ndue to imperfect cleaning of the beam sidelobes which can generate negative sources. To\nevaluate this effect, we selected a random sample of 50 NVSS fields (centered on NED\nextragalactic sources), at distances to M 87 between 52.5\u2032 and 56.5\u2032 , and looked in each one\nfor the minimum brightness. The histogram of the minima forms a smooth distribution down\nto -6.52 mJy per beam, and two outliers at \u2248 \u221212 and -16 mJy per beam. The latter are\ncharacteristically associated with a chain of other deep negative points, of amplitude scaled\nby about one third. Since this pattern is not present in the NGC 4491 map, we are confident\nthat such a deep negative component cannot be superimposed onto NGC 4491 (furthermore,\nit would have to coincide accurately with the galaxy's position, the probability of which is\nlow). We thus adopt as an absolute upper limit to any missing flux density the value 6.52 mJy,\nand we derive S(20 cm) < 7.9 mJy. We will use this limit in the following discussion, but we\ninsist that deeper observations at 20 cm are needed to set any more significant limit.\nThe new infrared to radio flux ratio is only constrained to be q > 2.65 = q\u0304 + 1.6\u03c3.\nHowever, the spectral indices are very flat: S([3.6\u20136.2 cm]) \u221d \u03bd \u22120.34 and S([6.2\u201320 cm]) \u221d \u03bd \u03b1\nwith \u03b1 > \u22120.22. The second value is very uncertain, but the [3.6\u20136.2 cm] index is more\nreliable. From radio continuum studies carried out at high angular resolution (Tarchi et al.\n2000; Beck et al. 2000; Turner et al. 1998; Kobulnicky & Johnson 1999), several starburst\ngalaxies, e.g. NGC 2146, NGC 4214, NGC5253, He 2-10 \u2013 for the most part with WolfRayet signatures and being either irregular, amorphous, blue compact or merging dwarf\ngalaxies \u2013 have been found to contain sources with flat or inverted radio spectra, revealing\noptically-thick free-free emission regions. However, we find that considering total infrared\nand radio fluxes, all of these galaxies have normal q ratios (between 2.23 and 2.67). Moreover,\nNGC 4491 emitting synchrotron emission at 3.6 cm, it is much more difficult to explain the\nshape of its radio spectrum by free-free absorption, for the thermal electrons would have to\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nfill a very compact distribution, and at the same time encompass the relativistic electrons.\nAssuming nevertheless that this is the case, the effective opacity at 20 cm would have to be\nlarger than 0.7 . Condon et al. (1991b) found three ultraluminous galaxies with q > 2.9,\nwhich are argued to be compact starbursts in merging systems, and whose radio-quiescence\nis best explained by high free-free opacity. However, these very luminous objects are not\ncomparable at all with the galaxies studied here. For two of them do stellar continuum\nobservations exist, and their 60 \u03bcm to near-infrared power ratios are more than 20 to 40\ntimes greater than in NGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953. Furthermore, the required free-free\nopacities are only 0.5\u20130.7 at 20 cm. Thus, NGC 4491 is more likely intrinsically deficient in\nsynchrotron emission rather than opaque at 20 cm.\nThe hypothesis of non-stellar activity powering the infrared and radio emission will be\ndiscussed in Section 7.5. Another possibility is that the population of relativistic electrons is\nvery young, so that no significant energy losses occurred yet. We address here the likelihood\nof such a scenario. The median spectral index of radio supernova remnants, which are\nthe likely sites of cosmic ray acceleration, is about \u22120.5 (with a total distribution between\n\u22120.2 and \u22120.8), independent of age (Clark & Caswell 1976; Gordon et al. 1999). This\nis significantly flatter than the spectral index of diffuse synchrotron emission in galactic\ndisks, \u22120.8 on average (Niklas et al. 1997). Very flat indices of supernova remnants can be\nreproduced in diffusive shock acceleration models, when second-order Fermi acceleration is\nalso included (Dr\u00f6ge et al. 1987) or when backreaction on the shock due to the pressure of\nthe relativistic particles is taken into account (Pelletier & Roland 1988). Since the lifetime of\nradio supernova remnants is short, \u2248 105 years (Ulvestad 1982), and they normally account\nfor a small fraction of the total synchrotron emission in a galaxy, it is unrealistic to assume\nthat the radio continuum emission of NGC 4491 be due predominantly to flat-spectrum\nsupernova remnants. Steepening of the energy spectrum is a natural effect of synchrotron\nand inverse Compton losses, once the relativistic electrons have escaped their acceleration\nsites, but it gradually takes place over their whole lifetime of several 107 years. Cosmic-ray\ndiffusion also contributes to steepen the radio spectrum: with a diffusion length scaling as\nE \u22120.6 for E > 1.5 GeV (Engelmann et al. 1990), the spectral index is decreased by \u22120.3.\nThe flat radio spectrum of NGC 4491 can therefore be explained if any old population of\ncosmic rays has completely decayed, and a fresh population has started building up within the\nlast few Myr. This is consistent with the observations presented in Section 4.1.1. Assuming\nconstant spectral indices between each measurement pair, the total radio power of NGC 4491\nbetween 3.6 cm and 20 cm is of the order of 74% of the radio power expected of a normal\nspectrum, or less, owing to the 20 cm upper limit and to the fact that unobserved frequencies\nlower than 1.4 GHz were not included in the computed power. It is thus conceivable that not\nall cosmic rays were yet released by supernova remnants and that the interstellar medium\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nof NGC 4491 is out of equilibrium (in which case the assumption of equipartition between\ncosmic ray and magnetic energy densities is invalidated).\n\n4.\n\nStar formation indicators\n\nThe H\u03b1 recombination line, classically used as tracer of massive stars, is not suitable\nto estimate the star formation rates of the three galaxies, because nebular extinction in the\ncircumnuclear core can be expected to be high. In a 2\u2032\u2032 -wide slit placed on the nucleus of\nNGC 1377, Kim et al. (1995) detect [NII] (6583 \u00c5) and [SII] (6716 and 6731 \u00c5) in emission,\nbut not H\u03b1, and furthermore a high [SII] 6716 to [SII] 6731 ratio, indicating that the detected\nnebular emission arises in low-excitation and low electronic density regions, presumably in\nshocks. Modelling the starburst nucleus of NGC 4569, Gabel & Bruhweiler (2002) found that\nthe [SII] and [NII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas at large distances from\nthe starburst core; the same may apply to NGC 1377.\nIC 1953 was observed in (H\u03b1 + [NII]) by Garc\u0131\u0301a-Barreto et al. (1996), who kindly\nprovided their map to us. In the H\u03b1 light, the circumnuclear region is fainter than several\nstar-formation complexes in the disk, whereas it is of much higher surface brightness than\nany other part of the galaxy in the 7 and 15 \u03bcm dust emission. The bar is not detected in\nH\u03b1, which is not customary in late-type galaxies, but more characteristic of strong bars.\nThe three galaxies do not feature in the optical range any indication of a starburst,\nbut have starburst-like far-infrared and mid-infrared colors. In order to better constrain the\nstar formation and supernova rates, we undertook an observation program of near-infrared\nemission lines.\n\n4.1.\n\nNear-infrared spectroscopy\n\nWe observed NGC 4491 on February 1 and 2, 2002, at the 5-m Hale telescope at the\nPalomar observatory, with the Palomar Integral Field Spectrograph, PIFS (Murphy et al.\n1999). The hydrogen recombination lines Pa\u03b2 and Br\u03b3 were chosen to estimate the star\nformation rate and the extinction in the circumnuclear region, and the [FeII] 1.644 line was\nused to set a constraint on the supernova rate. We also observed NGC 4102, as a bright\ncomparison galaxy with a very young circumnuclear starburst (Jogee & Kenney 1995; Roussel\net al. 2001b), but normal infrared and radio properties; its q ratio is 2.37, and its central\nmid-infrared color, F15 /F7 = 3.1, is comparable to those of the three galaxies studied here.\nOn October 17-19, 2002, we pursued this program by observing NGC 1377 in Pa\u03b2, Br\u03b3,\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n[FeII] 1.644 and the H2 (1-0) S(1) line at 2.12 \u03bcm. We chose as a second comparison galaxy\nNGC 1022, a bright starburst galaxy with a moderately high q ratio (Sect. 2.3). In view\nof the raw data, we decided to observe also H2 (2-1) S(1) at 2.25 \u03bcm and H2 (1-0) S(0) at\n2.22 \u03bcm. The observations and data reduction are described in Appendix A. The spectra\nare shown in Fig. 9 and the images and velocity maps in Fig. 10. In both NGC 4491 and\nNGC 1377, the velocity gradient derived from the line centroids is much smaller than the\nvelocity resolution.\n\n4.1.1. NGC 4491\nUsing the Pa\u03b2/Br\u03b3 decrement as an extinction estimator, we obtain A(Pa\u03b2) = 0.8 in\nthe central 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 of NGC 4491, and A(Pa\u03b2) = 2.4 in the central 4.83\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4.83\u2032\u2032 of NGC 4102.\nThis is assuming an intrinsic Pa\u03b2/Br\u03b3 ratio of 5.58, valid for Te = 5000 K and ne = 300 cm\u22123\n(Storey & Hummer 1995), and adopting the extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989). These\nextinctions are equivalent, in the H\u03b1 line, to respectively 2.4 and 7.3.\nAlthough the absolute central star formation rate of NGC 4491, (0.04 \u00b1 0.02) M\u2299 .yr\u22121\nusing the calibration of Kennicutt (1998), is much less than that of NGC 4102, (7.6 \u00b1\n0.3) M\u2299 .yr\u22121 , the Pa\u03b2 equivalent widths of the two galaxies are more comparable: we measure respectively 6.65 \u00c5 in 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d72\u2032\u2032 (2.24 \u00c5 in 5.7\u2032\u2032 \u00d75.7\u2032\u2032 ) and 9.16 \u00c5. NGC 4102 is experiencing\na powerful outflow (accounting for about one third of the total H recombination line fluxes),\nat a velocity of \u2248 800 km.s\u22121 , which confirms the youth of its starburst.\nThe [FeII] 1.644 emission is thought to be due to shock excitation in young supernova\nremnants (Vanzi & Rieke 1997). As supernovae appear only a few Myr after the starburst\nonset, the ratio of the [FeII] line to the hydrogen recombination lines, which are produced\nalmost instantaneously, rises as a function of time elapsed since the beginning of star formation. The [FeII]/Br\u03b3 flux ratio in the center of NGC 4102, corrected for extinction, amounts\nto about 1.3, which is in the low range of values found in spiral starbursts, between 0.9 and\n3 (Moorwood & Oliva 1988). In the central 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 of NGC 4491, [FeII]/Br\u03b3 is constrained\nto be less than 0.5 at the 3\u03c3 level. Comparing this to what is expected from the synthesis\nmodel of Leitherer et al. (1999) for continuous star formation over a short period, with default parameters (solar metallicity and Salpeter IMF between 1 and 100 M\u2299 ), the last star\nformation episode is less than 7.1 Myr old. In the same model, the starburst of NGC 4102 is\nat least twice older (\u2248 16.1 Myr), but has not reached steady-state either. NGC 4491 is very\nfaint, so our observations are not sensitive enough to produce more stringent a constraint.\nHowever, the data are consistent with the idea that NGC 4491 is observed very shortly after\nthe onset of a new episode of star formation, even more recent than in NGC 4102.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nFor the central 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1022, the galaxy used for comparison with NGC 1377, we\nderive A(H\u03b1) = 4.9, EW (Pa\u03b2) = 13.88 \u00c5, and [FeII]/Br\u03b3 \u2248 1.6. This galaxy has not reached\nsteady-state either, due to its moderately high infrared to radio flux ratio (Section 2.3), and\nhosts an extranuclear star-formation complex about 2\u2032\u2032 to the north of the nuclear complex.\n\n4.1.2. NGC 1377\nIf most ionizing photons are intercepted by dust as suggested by the radio spectrum of\nNGC 1377, then the hydrogen recombination lines severely underestimate the star formation\nrate. In agreement with the lack of free-free emission, we detect none of the hydrogen\nlines. In an area of 2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032\u2032 centered on the nucleus, the 3\u03c3 upper limits are F (Pa\u03b2) <\n2.24 \u00d7 10\u221219 W.m\u22122 and F (Br\u03b3) < 4.70 \u00d7 10\u221219 W.m\u22122 .\nWe do not detect either the shock tracer [FeII], but a strong H2 (1-0) S(1) emission line\nis observed. The H2 (2-1) S(1) to H2 (1-0) S(1) ratio is less than 0.03 and the H2 (1-0) S(0)\nto H2 (1-0) S(1) ratio is less than 0.07, which points to low-velocity shocks as the main\nmechanism exciting the molecular gas, rather than fluorescence, unless the gas density is\nhigh enough to de-excite the molecules by collisions (Hollenbach & Natta 1995) (but the\nhydrogen nucleus density would have to be higher than 106 cm\u22123 ). The emission arises in\na region smaller than 2\u2032\u2032 , or 200 pc. In the hypothesis of very high nebular extinction, the\nH2 emission is probably foreground, but it could also originate from the molecular material\nembedding the newly-formed stars. The young starburst NGC 1022 emits much less flux in\nH2 than in any other line (Table 5) and has a H2 (2-1) S(1) to H2 (1-0) S(1) ratio of the order\nof 0.2, so that both shocks and ultraviolet photons can contribute to the molecule excitation.\nThe lack of hydrogen emission in NGC 1377 may be due partly to lack of ionizing photons\nand partly to nebular extinction. In the assumption that dust absorbs as much as f = 95%\nof the ionizing photons, as suggested by the lowest radio continuum upper limit (Sect. 3.1),\nthen the dust emission could easily overestimate the star formation rate by a factor of two.\nWith SF Rtrue = SF Rdust /(1 + f ), our most stringent limit on the recombination rate still\nimplies a nebular absorption A(Pa\u03b2) > 3.7, or equivalently A(H\u03b1) > 11. If only 70% of\nthe ionizing photons are absorbed by dust (Sect. 3.1), then A(Br\u03b3) > 2.4, or A(H\u03b1) > 21.\nEither the nebular extinction is very high, or the quasi-totality of the ionizing photons are\nabsorbed by dust, i.e. no HII regions have yet appeared.\nTo prevent the development of HII regions, massive stars have to still undergo an active\naccretion-outflow phase, which lasts less than 105 years (Walmsley 1995). This phase could\nbe responsible for shocking the molecular gas in NGC 1377. Garay et al. (2002) discuss the\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nproperties of a Galactic IRAS source which is a massive star-forming region, still accreting\nmaterial, and with no free-free emission, hence in a pre-HII region stage. Osorio et al.\n(1999) modelled the dust emission from an accreting OB star, and obtained spectral energy\ndistributions strikingly similar to the 3\u2013100 \u03bcm spectrum of NGC 1377 in its qualitative\nfeatures. We thus propose that NGC 1377 may host a proto-cluster of this type of object,\naccounting for an unknown fraction of its infrared luminosity. In this case, a large part of\ndust heating might not be provided by the direct radiation from massive stars, but by the\naccretion luminosity (Osorio et al. 1999), and in view of the luminosities computed for a\nrange of model parameters, of the order of 5 \u00d7 104 O stars would be needed to generate the\ntotal infrared luminosity of NGC 1377, i.e. a few times more than for main-sequence stars.\nThe continuum emission in the PIFS field of view has the same morphology and orientation as the large-scale stellar emission (Fig. 1) and shows no disturbance. The velocity\ngradient in the H2 (1-0) S(1) line is much less than the velocity resolution, and the continuum emission does not indicate any stellar density cusp. However, the continuum map\nratios reveal an emission excess in the Ks band, in the central 1\u20132\u2032\u2032 (slightly elongated parallel to the major axis). The color excesses with respect to the surrounding bluer area,\n\u2206(H1.655 \u2212 K2.142 ) \u2248 0.5 and \u2206(J1.29 \u2212 H1.655 ) \u2248 0.2, are not compatible with pure extinction\n(A(H1.655 \u2212 K2.142 )/A(J1.29 \u2212 H1.655 ) = 0.7 using the extinction law of Cardelli et al. (1989)),\nbut consistent with the presence of hot dust contributing to the Ks-band emission. Assuming that the hot dust contributes only to the Ks-band flux, and not to the J and H fluxes,\nwe find that F\u03bd (7.7)/F\u03bd (Kdust ), the flux density ratio of the mid-infrared peak at 7.7 \u03bcm\nto the Ks-band excess, is of the order of 500. As a comparison, Lu et al. (2003) found an\naverage ratio of 150 in a sample of normal star-forming galaxies (see their Figure 6a). The\n6\u20138 \u03bcm mid-infrared emission in NGC 1377 is thus abnormally high not only with respect\nto the far-infrared emission, but also with respect to the hot dust emission in the Ks band,\nalthough its (H-K) color excess is more extreme than in all but one of the galaxies studied\nby Hunt et al. (2002), drawn from the same sample as the galaxies in Lu et al. (2003).\n\n4.2.\n\nStar formation rate estimates\n\nTable 6 lists the total star formation rates based on an extrapolation of far-infrared fluxes\nto the 8\u20131000 \u03bcm range (Kennicutt 1998), using the observed spectral energy distribution to\ncompute the 8\u201342 \u03bcm flux and the model of Dale et al. (2001) to estimate the contribution\nfrom 122 to 1000 \u03bcm, as a function of F60 /F100 . Star formation rates in the circumnuclear\nregions can be derived from the spatially-decomposed mid-infrared fluxes, applying the calibration established in Roussel et al. (2001c). IC 1953 and NGC 4491 are depleted in 7 \u03bcm\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nemission with respect to the far-infrared, which could mean that the aromatic band carriers are destroyed in these high dust-temperature galaxies; the 7 \u03bcm calibration is therefore\nnot applicable to them without correcting for the grain destruction effect. Considering that\ngalaxies from which the calibration was derived have L7 /LFIR ratios between 0.12 and 0.25,\nand that this quantity is about 0.02 in the center of IC 1953 and 0.04 in NGC 4491, we estimate star formation rates of respectively 1.65 \u00b1 0.60 M\u2299 .yr\u22121 and 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 M\u2299 .yr\u22121 . These\nnumbers are not far below the total star formation rates. NGC 1377, on the contrary, has a\n7 \u03bcm to far-infrared flux ratio similar to normal and disk-dominated galaxies (Fig. 6). Although the 6\u201311 \u03bcm spectrum of NGC 1377 reveals that the dust responsible for the emission\nin this range is peculiar, the star formation rate derived from F7 agrees to within 3% with\nthat derived from the total dust emission for NGC 1377 (Table 6).\nTo further characterize the star formation activities in the central regions of IC 1953\nand NGC 4491, a comparison of their mid-infrared data with those of circumnuclear starbursts and merging galaxies, for which ionizing photon flux densities derived independently\nare available, can be instructive. Using the circumnuclear regions of the galaxy sample of\nRoussel et al. (2001a), the starburst galaxies M 82, NGC 253 and NGC 1808, and the merging\nsystems Arp 220 and NGC 6240 to span a range of more than five orders of magnitude in\nstar formation surface density, we found a well-defined relationship between the mid-infrared\ncolor and the ionizing photon flux density (F\u00f6rster-Schreiber & Roussel in preparation). 7 \u03bcm\nfluxes show no appearance of saturation and remain valid star formation tracers up to ionizing photon flux densities as high as 5\u00d71048 s\u22121 pc\u22122 , but decline steadily above that threshold\n(F\u00f6rster-Schreiber & Roussel in preparation). The colors of IC 1953 and NGC 4491 suggest\nthat their star formation is more compact than in the M 82 core. If this assumption is correct, this corresponds to ionizing photon flux densities above 1016 s\u22121 m\u22122 . Combined with\nstar formation rates derived from the total infrared emission, upper limits on the sizes of the\nstar-forming cores can be inferred: diameters of less than 125 pc and 70 pc are respectively\nobtained. In the blackbody assumption, we obtain lower limits of 46 pc and 35 pc.\nThe derived star formation rates are only of the order of 0.3\u20132 M\u2299 .yr\u22121 . However, the\nthree galaxies have low masses. Comparing these rates with the underlying stellar mass,\nas traced by the Ks-band light, we find that the timescale to build up an equivalent mass\nis only of the order of 0.5\u20132 Gyr in the central \u2248 5\u2032\u2032 of NGC 1377, IC 1953 and NGC 4491\n(using M/LKs = 0.7 M\u2299 /L\u2299Ks , as found by Grosbol & Patsis (1998), with Ks\u2299 = 3.33 mag,\nfrom Colina et al. (1996)). As a comparison, this timescale is similar for the starburst in\nNGC 4102 (1.7 Gyr) and much longer in the bright star-forming center of the normal spiral\nNGC 4535 (of the order of 10 Gyr). The star formation activity in the three galaxies can\nthus be truly identified with starbursts.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nUsing the star formation rate range derived from dust emission, and comparing it with\nthe extinguished star formation rate derived from the H\u03b1 line, we derive an absorption in\nH\u03b1 between 4.3 and 4.9 for the circumnuclear region of IC 1953. If the [NII] to H\u03b1 ratio\nwere unusually high such as in NGC 1377, then the nebular absorption could be even higher.\nFor NGC 4491, we have measured the star formation rate from near-infrared hydrogen\nrecombination lines in the PIFS field of view. The 7 \u03bcm-emitting region may be larger than\nthis, but the strong discrepancy between the recombination estimate and the dust estimate\n(Table 6) points to either a major fraction of the nebular emission being completely screened,\nor an overestimation of the star formation rate by the infrared emission, unless photospheric\nabsorption from a young stellar population strongly affects the hydrogen line strengths.\n\n4.3.\n\nExcitation of the interstellar medium\n\nFar-infrared lines due to collisional excitation in photodissociation regions and ionized\nregions were observed by ISO-LWS with an effective beam of 78\u2032\u2032 (LWS handbook). This\nbeam is much larger than the size of the infrared emission of NGC 1377 and NGC 4491, but\nencompasses only 60% of the total 7 \u03bcm emission of IC 1953. Fluxes are collected in Table 7.\nThe [CII] 157.7 line is the major coolant of photodissociation regions. Since aromatic\nband carriers dominating the emission in the 7 \u03bcm bandpass are of planar structure, they\nare thought to be more efficient sources of photoelectric heating than three-dimensional dust\ngrains (d'Hendecourt & L\u00e9ger 1987). This finds a confirmation in the constancy of the [CII]\nto 7 \u03bcm flux ratio found by Helou et al. (2001) in star-forming spiral galaxies. NGC 4491 and\nIC 1953 behave exactly as this sample: their F[CII] /F7 ratios are within 1.5\u03c3 of the average\nvalue. Their F[CII] /FCO ratio is of the order of 2000\u20134000, depending on the assumed CO\nspatial distribution, or less, owing to the smaller CO beams in the observations of Boselli\net al. (1995) and Combes et al. (1994) (respectively 33\u2032\u2032 and 44\u2032\u2032 ). These values are typical\nof normal star-forming galaxies, and argue for near-solar metallicities, since metal-deficient\ngalaxies will have much higher ratios (Madden 2000). However, NGC 1377 appears deficient\nin [CII] by at least an order of magnitude and lies more than 6.5\u03c3 (in dex units) below the\naverage F[CII] /F7 . Interestingly, the 7 \u03bcm flux in NGC 1377, which is not produced by classical\naromatic particles, is also 0.85 dex higher than expected from its 60 and 100 \u03bcm fluxes\n(Fig. 5). The species responsible for the 7 \u03bcm emission in NGC 1377 is thus either not easily\nphotoionized, because already highly ionized in its equilibrium state, or is heated mainly by\nlow-energy photons, which is unlikely owing to the observed high dust temperatures in this\ngalaxy, or is not an efficient purveyor of photoelectrons if its structure is not planar.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nC+ is collisionally de-excited above relatively low densities, such that the [CII] deficiency\nof NGC 1377 could be due to increased density; but [OI] 63 remains an efficient cooling agent\nat densities 100 times higher. Since the F[OI] /FFIR ratio of NGC 1377 is also low compared to\nthe values it takes in Malhotra et al. (2001), this explanation can be ruled out. Malhotra et\nal. (2001) also discard high optical depths in C+ as the cause of the [CII] deficiency (relative\nto the far-infrared flux) in their high-F60 /F100 galaxies, because they would expect [OI] to\nbecome optically thick before [CII], which they do not observe. A plausible origin of the [CII]\ndeficiency in NGC 1377 is thus a radiation field intense enough to highly ionize the small\ndust particles emitting in the mid-infrared, which then cannot heat the interstellar medium,\nand different structural properties of these particles than in normal galaxies. Alternatively,\nsince HII regions seem to be absent in NGC 1377 (Sect. 3.1 and 4.1.2), C+ ions may not\nexist and thus be unable to act as a coolant. In any case, the [CII] deficiency is unusual and\npuzzling.\nThe upper limits on F[NII] are within the range of detections at lower dust temperatures\nof Malhotra et al. (2001), when normalized by the far-infrared flux.\n\n5.\n\nMolecular gas\n\nNGC 1377 was observed in the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines at the SEST in January\n2003, during three sessions of 7 h each, as part of the ESO time share. Important details on\nthe observations can be found in Appendix B. The measurements and results are given in\nTable 8.\nR\nWe measure T\u2217A dV = (1.75 \u00b1 0.12) K km s\u22121 for the CO(1-0) line and a CO(2-1) to\nCO(1-0) brightness temperature ratio of 0.53 \u00b1 0.14. The spectra are shown in Figure 11.\nThe averages of the spectra of the five centermost pointings are shown in Figure 12. The\nCO(2-1) line profile is perfectly fitted by a gaussian of FWHM 66 km s\u22121 ; the CO(1-0) line\nprofile can be fitted by a gaussian of the same width and centered at the same velocity,\nbut shows a wing toward high velocities. This excess is only at the 2\u03c3 level. For lack of\nadequate constraints on the H2 mass to CO luminosity ratio, we adopt a standard value of\n2.3\u00d71024 molecules m\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 (Strong et al. 1988), which is uncertain by a factor of at\nleast a few. For infrared-luminous starbursts in which CO is subthermally excited, assuming\nvirialized clouds, Radford et al. (1991) derive factors between about 2 and 7 \u00d7 1024 , in the\nsame unit. Due to its low CO(2-1) to CO(1-0) brightness ratio, collisional excitation of the\nmolecular gas in NGC 1377 seems to be also subthermal. Garay et al. (1993) similarly found\nvery low CO(2-1) to CO(1-0) brightness ratios in starburst galaxies, that suggest that most\nof the emission comes from low-density and very clumpy gas (Park & Hong 1995), while the\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nstar-forming cores are probably hidden by their envelopes. We derive a hydrogen mass of\nthe order of 2.0 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . This is at least ten times more than the minimum mass required\nby the starburst hypothesis (Sect. 3.1). The far-infrared to CO flux ratio is about seven\ntimes higher than the average for normal galaxies, but within the broad range observed\nfor starbursts (Sanders & Mirabel 1985), which is not surprising owing to the high dust\ntemperature and emissivity in NGC 1377. The total gas mass to blue luminosity ratio lies\nat the upper bound of the range measured by Welch & Sage (2003) for a volumed-limited\nsample of lenticular galaxies. The timescale to consume all the molecular gas, including the\nmass of helium and metals, at the current star formation rate derived from the far-infrared\nemission, can be estimated to only \u2248 170 Myr.\nThe CO(1-0) line was also observed in IC 1953, NGC 4491 and NGC 4418 (see below a\ndiscussion of this galaxy), with smaller signal to noise ratios (Combes et al. 1994; Boselli et\nal. 1995; Sanders et al. 1991). In all cases, the velocity profile is very narrow (approximate\nFWHM of 120, 80 and 120 km s\u22121 ), and the direct effect of rotation invisible, which argues for\na concentration of the molecular gas in a small central area. The size of the molecular disk,\neven if it cannot be directly estimated, can be coarsely constrained by indirect arguments. If\none assumes that NGC 1377 must follow the same Schmidt law as characterized by Kennicutt\n(1998) from normal spirals to starbursts, within the observed scatter, then the diameter of\nthe gas disk should be (150\u00b1300) pc. Dynamics can be used to set an independent constraint,\nbut one has to make the unverified assumption that the CO disk is coplanar with the stellar\ndisk, which could be false if the gas was accreted from another galaxy. The maximum\nvelocity, corrected for inclination, is about 90 km s\u22121 . In case the gas is decoupled from stars\n(i.e. the stars are distributed in a much more extended structure with a significant planeperpendicular scale height), the diameter is about 330 pc. If the gas is confined within this\nregion, then it accounts for a large fraction of the total enclosed mass: at least a quarter,\nestimating the stellar mass from the Ks image.\nWe now compute the Toomre parameter for local gravitational stability, Qg = vs \u03ba/(\u03c0G\u03bcg )\n(Toomre 1964), in the same manner as usually done for galactic centers, i.e. assuming a gas\ndensity \u03bcg equal to the average, and the epicyclic angular velocity \u03ba = 2V /R in the linear\npart of the rotation curve. The sound speed vs is chosen of the order of 10 km s\u22121 , and the\ndiameter 4\u2032\u2032 (400 pc). In these conditions, Qg \u2243 0.3, which means that the gas is locally\nvery unstable. We neglected stars, although they influence the gas stability, but they are\nexpected to only decrease it (Jog & Solomon 1984). The parameters entering Qg are all\nill-constrained, and there is no guarantee that the gas is distributed in a thin disk, but if\nit is the case, since values close to unity are routinely found in the literature (indicating\ngravitational stability allowing the mild growth of perturbations), it is at least likely that\nthe molecular gas disk of NGC 1377 be overcritical. This would explain the instantaneous\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\ntrigger of a starburst throughout \u2248 100 pc. Sound evidence clearly requires more detailed\ndata, difficult to obtain owing to the low brightness of NGC 1377.\nFinally, the CO flux can be coupled with the H2 line measurements described in Section 4.1.2, to estimate the mass fraction of hot molecular gas. The H2 (1-0) S(0) upper limit\ndoes not bring any useful constraint, but the lower limit on the H2 (1-0) S(1) / H2 (2-1) S(1)\nflux ratio implies temperatures below 1500 K. With standard assumptions (due to lack of\nconstraints by the observations), the hot H2 mass is then above 250 M\u2299 , and the fraction of\nhot gas is above \u2248 10\u22126 . Such a fraction is in the normal range found for bright starburst\ngalaxies and cannot be further constrained.\n\n6.\n\nNGC 4418: similarities and differences\n\nNGC 4418, mentioned by Yun et al. (2001) as a high-q galaxy, is an interesting case for\nwhich very valuable data exist. Its far-infrared luminosity is \u2248 5 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 , with LFIR /LB \u2248\n35, F60 /F100 = 1.44 and F25 /F60 = 0.21. The NVSS map shows a second source without any\noptical counterpart about 1.25\u2032 to the east, which is certainly included in the IRAS fluxes;\ndepending if this source is included or not in the 21 cm flux, the q ratio of NGC 4418 is 3.02\nor 3.09, between 3.5 and 3.9\u03c3 above the average ratio.\nSpoon et al. (2001) show that its mid-infrared spectrum presents a broad feature similar\nto that observed in NGC 1377, but with strong ice absorption bands superposed, which are\nalmost never observed. Other peculiarities of this galaxy are the detection of the H2 line at\n2.12 \u03bcm in emission (Ridgway et al. 1994) and of an OH megamaser (Martin et al. 1988).\nDudley & Wynn-Williams (1997) suggested that, like in Arp 220, the infrared emission arises\nfrom an extremely compact energy source.\nNGC 4418 is also deficient in [CII], but F[CII] /F7 is only constrained to be more than 2\u03c3\nbelow the average ratio in Helou et al. (2001). There are two other major differences with\nrespect to NGC 1377: NGC 4418 has much lower mid-infrared to far-infrared flux ratios, in\nagreement with the predictions from its high dust temperature, and a very compact radio\nsource is detected at its nucleus, with a brightness temperature of 104.9 \u2013105.0 K both at\n2.3 GHz inside 0.1\u2032\u2032 (Kewley et al. 2000) and at 1.49 GHz inside 0.5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.3\u2032\u2032 (Condon et al.\n1990). NGC 4418 is not detected in X-rays (Cagnoni et al. 1998). Although the compactness\nand extreme extinction in NGC 4418 suggest the presence of a Seyfert nucleus, a highly\ncompact starburst is also plausible, and the nuclear 2.2 \u03bcm emission is shown to be more\nextended than the PSF by Eales et al. (1990). The 3.55 cm radio continuum, observed with\nthe VLA in a 0.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.25\u2032\u2032 (J.J. Condon, unpublished) confirms that the radio source is\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nextended, with a size of 0.20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.16\u2032\u2032 .\nDuring our radio continuum observations of NGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953 at Effelsberg, we also mapped NGC 4418 (Fig. 8). We measured (33.3 \u00b1 1.3) mJy at 6.2 cm and\n(19.7 \u00b1 1.2) mJy at 3.6 cm (the beam including the source located 1.25\u2032 eastward). Combined with the NVSS flux at 21 cm, (47.9 \u00b1 1.8) mJy (with the contaminating eastward\nsource added to NGC 4418), this indicates a pronounced spectral bend from a steep index\nat high frequencies (S[3\u22126 cm] \u221d \u03bd \u22120.94 ) to a flat index at low frequencies (S[6\u221221 cm] \u221d \u03bd \u22120.30 ).\nThe implied high free-free opacity is consistent with the high extinction and compactness\nof NGC 4418. We find that the combined effect of both thermal opacity and a reduction of\nthe intrinsic synchrotron emission (with respect to the level expected from the far-infrared\nemission) provides the best fit to the spectrum. The lowest possible opacity and most reasonable non-thermal spectral index, \u03c4 (21 cm) = 0.9 and \u03b1nth = \u22121.17, are obtained for an\nintrinsic deficit of synchrotron emission of about 50%. Diminishing the synchrotron deficit\nin the model causes the opacity to rise and the spectral index to become steeper; assuming\nno deficit, \u03c4 (21 cm) would have to be as high as 1.6 and \u03b1nth as low as -1.57 .\nJ.J. Condon obtained with the VLA-A a higher flux at 3.6 cm: 27.4 mJy, including the\ncontaminating eastward source. Using this measurement instead of the single-dish flux, we\nobtain a maximum opacity \u03c4 (21 cm) = 0.5, the steepest possible non-thermal spectral index\nis \u03b1nth = \u22120.7, and in such conditions, the intrinsic synchrotron emission is reduced by 70%\nwith respect to a galaxy with normal q ratio.\nBased on this new result, and on the other existing evidence, we argue that the infrared\nemission of NGC 4418 originates from a very young and compact starburst. Seyfert activity\nis not necessary to explain the data. The emission line properties of NGC 4418 are also\nstrikingly similar to those of NGC 1377. It was observed with the PIFS spectrograph by\nDale et al. (in preparation), who detected neither Pa\u03b2, Br\u03b3 nor [FeII] 1.644, but a clear\nH2 (1-0) S(1) line. This fact strengthens the similarity between the two galaxies, and suggests\na common excitation mechanism; since NGC 4418 is a synchrotron source, though, it must\nhave reached a later evolutionary stage than NGC 1377, and is possibly a composite source\ncontaining both a nascent starburst and a more evolved component.\n\n7.\n\nScenarios for the synchrotron deficiency\n\nWe now discuss plausible physical scenarios to account for the high infrared to radio\nratios of the three galaxies we have studied. If they are due to a deficit of radio emission,\nthen the primary possibility is a lack of cosmic rays, which would follow either from a nascent\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nstarburst or from an initial mass function biased towards low-mass stars; the alternative is a\nvery weak magnetic field. If the radio emission is not depressed, then it might be absorbed,\npointing to optically-thick 20 cm emission. Finally, we discuss the possibility of non-stellar\nactivity providing dust heating but remaining radio-quiet.\n\n7.1.\n\nNascent starbursts\n\nThe hypothesis that we favor to explain the infrared activity and the radio deficiency of\nNGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953 is the onset of a star formation burst in their centers. In\nthis view, the synchrotron weakness derives from a lack of relativistic electrons, which can\nhappen if the previous major star formation episode occurred more than \u2248 108 years ago,\nand the current episode started less than a few (1 to 7) Myr before the epoch of observation.\nIn NGC 1377 and the central region of IC 1953, no synchrotron component is detected, which\nimplies in this scenario that no or very few supernovae have yet been produced. In NGC 4491,\nthe synchrotron component does exist but has a much flatter than usual spectral index. We\ninterpret this as due to an energy distribution of cosmic rays inflated with high energies,\nrather than the effect of free-free opacity; the number of relativistic electrons released by\nsupernovae is significant, but may still be rising, and the near-infrared spectroscopic results\nindicate that shocks are weaker than expected from a steady-state situation.\nOther observations consistent with this scenario are: the high dust temperatures, indicating starburst-like radiation intensities; the extreme F15 /F7 flux ratios of NGC 4491 and\nIC 1953, suggesting that very young stellar populations are dominating the dust heating; the\nmid-infrared spectrum of NGC 1377, which suggests that dust nanoparticles have not been\nprocessed into classical aromatic components radiating in normal star-forming galaxies.\n\n7.2.\n\nInitial mass function\n\nSince the mass spectrum of stars able to heat the dust extends to much lower values\nthan that of stars producing supernovae, high infrared to radio flux ratios could be achieved\nif the initial mass function had a very steep slope, making high-mass stars rarer than in\nnormal galaxies. In this hypothesis, the extreme dust temperatures would however require\nextreme stellar densities. To be compatible with the 21 cm upper limit of NGC 1377, the\ncutoff of a truncated Salpeter IMF would have to be less than 8 M\u2299 , since supernovae have to\nbe totally suppressed. However, according to the model of D\u00e9sert et al. (1990), the F60 /F100\nratio of NGC 1377 implies an average radiation field about 400 times higher than the solar\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nneighborhood field throughout the dust emission region. Reaching this radiation field with\nonly M < 8 M\u2299 stars is impossible to reconcile with the data, as we will show with a simplistic\nmodel assuming a uniform stellar distribution. The Ks-band image gives us a constraint on\nthe stellar mass density. The H\u03b1+[NII] map of Heisler & Vader (1995), of better resolution\nthan the infrared maps, delineates a central region of radius \u2248 5\u2032\u2032 . Using the model of\nLeitherer et al. (1999), we computed the bolometric power per unit of stellar mass produced\nby a star formation episode lasting 10 Myr (IMF-truncated) and by an older population of\n1 Gyr, as well as their mass to light ratios in the Ks band (close to 1 M\u2299 /L\u2299Ks ), and then\nthe resulting radiation field in the center as a function of the mass fraction of the younger\npopulation. Using the value of the solar neighborhood radiation field given by Mathis et\nal. (1983), we find that the radiation field is high enough only if more than 80% of the\nmass is locked in the IMF-truncated starburst, hence the mass of any old stellar population\nis negligible. Since this is unrealistic, an abnormal IMF is unlikely to cause the observed\nsynchrotron deficiency in NGC 1377. In IC 1953, the average radiation field intensity implied\nby the dust temperature is only 100 times the solar neighborhood value (in fact more than\n200 times in the circumnuclear region, according to the decomposition shown in Fig. 5), but\nthe required stellar density is still much higher than that observed, unless more than 65% of\nthe central mass had been generated by a recent starburst.\n\n7.3.\n\nMagnetic field and inverse Compton losses\n\nThe hypothesis of a weak magnetic field remains difficult to rule out. However, if\nthe magnetic energy density of some galaxies happened to be 10\u201340 times lower than in\nnormal galaxies, it would be difficult to explain why this is so rare and why this deficiency\nis connected with high dust temperatures, which are observed in all high-q galaxies, unless\nit is causally linked with the occurrence of a starburst. If the magnetic pressure is unusually\nlow, then cloud collapse is more efficient and a starburst can be triggered at relatively low\ngas densities; however, the question remains of what caused the low magnetic pressure,\nand why the starburst was not triggered before. It is also possible, if magnetic fields are\nusually amplified by a starburst due to increased turbulence, that there is a time delay\nfor the adjustment of the magnetic field; this would become a likely scenario if we detected\nsignificant shock excitation by supernovae by means of the [FeII] emission line. Note however\nthat the radio spectra of NGC 4491, NGC 4418 and the disk of IC 1953 bring evidence of a\nnormal magnetic field strength, because they show substantial synchrotron emission, and\nthat no signs of supernova shocks exist yet for NGC 1377.\nRandom magnetic fields of a few \u03bcG, about half the typical strength of total magnetic\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nfields in spiral galaxies, are expected from turbulence alone, even in the absence of largescale dynamo action. Field strengths of several \u03bcG are easily obtained in elliptical galaxies\nalthough they are devoid of rotation (Lesch & Bender 1990; Moss & Shukurov 1996), comparable to strengths in spirals. Unbiased statistical information about synchrotron emission of\nellipticals is uneasy to find, but they are much weaker radio emitters than spirals, and their\nactivity is mostly due to Seyfert nuclei (Condon et al. 2002a); their star formation rates are\ntoo low to produce enough cosmic rays. Magnetic field amplification by large-scale dynamo\nprocesses occurs on timescales as large as 5 \u00d7 108 years (Beck et al. 1996). However, the\ngrowth of random fields requires much less time. Depending on the turbulence characteristics, in particular the cut-off scale, the fastest-growing modes in a predominantly neutral\nmedium may develop on timescales as small as 104 years, according to Subramanian (1998).\nAs pointed out by Lisenfeld et al. (1996), the fact that quiescent galaxies and starbursts\nfollow the same infrared-radio correlation, despite the large expected differences in inverse\nCompton losses, suggests that the total magnetic field grows subsequent to a starburst. If\ninverse Compton losses are dominant over synchrotron losses, the lifetime of relativistic electrons is inversely proportional to the radiation energy density. Assuming a size of 100 pc for\nthe infrared-emitting region of NGC 1377 (see Sect. 3.1), the radiation energy density integrated between 3 and 120 \u03bcm, at the surface of the region, is of the order of 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 J m\u22123 .\nIn the ultraluminous compact starbursts studied by Condon et al. (1991b), the typical radiation energy density is estimated to be six times higher than this, and yet they are strong\nradio continuum emitters, so that synchrotron losses must at least balance inverse Compton losses: mechanisms at work to amplify magnetic fields seem to conspire to produce a\nconstant ratio of magnetic energy density to radiation energy density. This must occur on\ntimescales comparable to or shorter than the growth time of the supernova rate, otherwise\nsignificant deviations from the correlation would be observed.\nThe issue of magnetic field strength is unsettled for NGC 1377, but we would like to\nstress that a weak field is not required to explain the synchrotron deficiency, since it is\neasily achieved by lack of cosmic rays, consistent with the fact that no supernova activity is\nobserved. Furthermore, a separate cause has to be sought to explain the absence of free-free\nemission, which is unaffected by the magnetic field strength.\nAlternatively, if the magnetic field in a galaxy were amplified beyond normal values, it\nwould cause more intense radio emission for the same injected population of cosmic rays,\nsince the synchrotron emissivity scales as a large power of the field strength (index between\n2 and 4). As a result, the infrared-to-radio ratio would decrease, but the radio emission\nwould fade faster after an episode of star formation. If the magnetic field became so strong\nthat the cosmic rays decayed very fast, the synchrotron emission would appear in intense\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nbursts followed by periods of radio quiescence. In a steady-state situation, allowing some\nuncertainty range for the IMF slope, one would expect from the infrared luminosity of\nNGC 1377 a type-II supernova explosion, on average, at least every 100 years. Thus, cosmic\nrays should be injected into the interstellar medium, after a time delay, at this average rate.\nFor the lifetime of cosmic-ray electrons to be reduced to 100 years or less at GHz frequencies, a\nmagnetic field of the order of 50 mG would be required over large portions of the interstellar\nmedium (Condon 1992), that is to say 5 \u00d7 103 times higher than the typical strength in\nspiral galaxies (Beck 2001). No amplification mechanism is known to achieve such a result\non large spatial scales, and such a strong field would clearly not be confined (Parker 1966).\nInvoking such absurd values of the magnetic field is much less credible than the nascent\nstarburst hypothesis. As a comparison, Carilli & Barthel (1996) estimate fields strengths\nup to 350 \u03bcG in the radio-loud galaxy Cygnus A, using the assumption of minimum energy\ndensity for the sum of cosmic rays and magnetic fields. Starburst galaxies may have magnetic\nfields of a few 10 \u03bcG, generally calculated under the same mimimum-energy assumption; for\ninstance, Klein et al. (1988) derived an equipartition total field of 50 \u03bcG in M 82.\n\n7.4.\n\nElectron opacity\n\nWe can discard high opacity at 21 cm as the reason for radio weakness, because it would\nrequire NGC 1377 and IC 1953 to have respectively \u03c4 (21 cm) > 2.8 and \u03c4 (21 cm) > 0.5, only\nin order to have an intrinsic q of q\u0304 + 2\u03c3, and NGC 4491 would have to feature an unrealistic\ngeometry. High opacities are very unlikely, since the high-q ultraluminous compact starbursts\nstudied by Condon et al. (1991b) (with q > q\u0304 + 3\u03c3), much more active and dense, have\nestimated opacities of only 0.5\u20130.7.\n\n7.5.\n\nSeyfert activity\n\nThe infrared-radio properties of NGC 1377 and NGC 4491 may be suggestive of the\npresence of active nuclei in these galaxies. However, spectral diagnostics do not support this\nview, since emission lines are either absent or very weak and narrow.\nTwo indirect arguments can be put forward to support the presence of a Seyfert nucleus:\nwarm infrared colors, and the compactness of the infrared emission. We consider the argument of deep silicate absorption in the 9\u201311 \u03bcm range in NGC 1377 speculative, especially\nsince the continuum emission longward of 11 \u03bcm has not been observed, and because it would\nbe difficult to reconcile with the moderate dust to stellar emission power ratio; diagnostics\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nbased on optical spectroscopy cannot be applied. However, the above two characteristics\nsupport equally well the hypothesis of a young starburst. The mid-infrared spectrum is\nan extremely ambiguous diagnostic, since it does not show the aromatic bands associated\nwith star formation, but does show an unusual emission feature, in place of the continuum\nexpected in a pure Seyfert nucleus. Concerning the infrared broadband colors, Yun et al.\n(2001), for instance, have shown that they are not valid discriminants between starburst and\nSeyfert activities \u2013 even if a larger percentage of energetically-dominating Seyfert galaxies is\nfound in any sample pre-selected to have warm colors, than in a sample with cooler colors.\nThe concentration factor is not a strong argument either, since a young starburst will be\ncompact (to trigger a star formation burst instantaneously over a large area requires uncommon conditions); the data for NGC 1377 suggest that the size could be as small as \u2248 100 pc,\ni.e. 1\u2032\u2032 (Sect. 3.1), and is smaller than \u2248 2\u2032\u2032 , i.e. 200 pc (Sect. 4.1.2). In addition, Seyfert\nnuclei powerful enough to dominate dust heating tend to occur in massive galaxies with a\ndeep potential well, whereas NGC 1377 is a low-mass galaxy and with a shallow potential.\nBut perhaps the most problematic fact for Seyfert activity is the radio deficiency.\nMany active nuclei are known to be radio-quiet. However, their q ratios are the same\nas in normal galaxies. For instance, the infrared-loud and radio-quiet quasar studied by\nBeichman et al. (1986) has an observed q = 2.48 = q\u0304 + 0.75\u03c3, even if it is strongly absorbed\nat 20 cm. In the sample of Ho (2002), containing a large number of radio-quiet active nuclei,\nno nucleus has a q ratio significantly higher than the average for normal galaxies; all the\nSeyfert-type galaxies which are not detected at 20 cm are not detected by IRAS either. We\nhave further verified this fact by selecting in the NED database all galaxies in the quasar\ncategory with F60 > 0.5 Jy and no mention of a radio association; on the 53 objects thus\nselected, 7 were excluded for lack of any radio observations, and all the others have either\nnormal or low q ratios. The infrared brightness of NGC 1377 thus presents serious difficulties\nfor the hypothesis of a radio-quiet active nucleus.\nAn examination of the energetics provides another argument against the production of\nthe infrared power of NGC 1377 by an active nucleus. Assuming that the radiated power\nis equal to the Eddington limit, LE (W) = 1.3 \u00d7 1031 MBH (M\u2299 ), and that it goes entirely\ninto dust heating, an upper limit on the black hole mass provides an upper limit on the\ninfrared power. For a given black hole mass, the radio loudness can vary considerably (e.g.\nWoo & Urry (2002)); but for radio-quiet active nuclei exclusively, estimating black hole\nmasses from reverberation mapping techniques, Nelson (2000) found a correlation between\nthe black hole mass and the radio power, with a lower envelope of all their data of the\nform P (20 cm)(W Hz\u22121 ) = 1015.2 (MBH /M\u2299 )0.84 . Using the 20 cm upper limit for NGC 1377,\nthe alleged black hole cannot be more massive than 2.4 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 . Using alternatively the\nkinematic information derived from the H2 emission line (Sect. 4.1.2), another limit can be\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nset. With a velocity gradient below 40 km s\u22121 , the inclination-corrected rotation velocity is\nless than 25 km s\u22121 (with a signal to noise ratio of \u2248 5 throughout the central 2\u2032\u2032 ). Assuming\nvirial equilibrium, and provided the H2 lies in the plane of the galactic disk, we then do not\nexpect more than 1.5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 to be enclosed in the central parsec. Using the first upper\nlimit, we thus find that the maximum infrared power (in extremely unrealistic conditions)\nradiated by an active nucleus is 3 \u00d7 1036 W. In fact, it is expected to be a factor of several\nbelow this value, because the dust heating efficiency cannot be 100%. The infrared luminosity\nof NGC 1377 being 3.9 \u00d7 1036 W, an active nucleus cannot easily account for it.\nThe absence of synchrotron emission might be attributed to lack of magnetic field\n(Sect. 7.3), or extreme inverse Compton losses, due to the high radiation field intensity\nin NGC 1377. Nevertheless, an active nucleus must also produce some free-free emission,\nwhich is not detected either. Inside the region where dust grains are sublimated, the Lyman continuum photons are free to ionize the gas, contrary to the situation in an embedded\nstarburst. Elvis et al. (1994) have compiled spectral energy distributions of quasars and\nestimated, in particular, the ionizing photon flux and the total power between 1000\u00c5 and\n100 \u03bcm. The ratio between these two quantities is Nion /LU V \u2212IR = (8.1 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 1016 s\u22121 W\u22121\n(or Lion /LU V \u2212IR = 0.5 \u00b1 0.2). Taking the infrared luminosity of NGC 1377 as a lower limit\nto LU V \u2212IR and assuming that the ionizing photon flux available in the dust-free region is\nequal to Nion /2, the free-free emission at 3.6 cm, where thermal opacity is negligible, should\namount to \u2248 (2.8\u00b11.0) mJy (with Te = 5000 K). It would thus have been detected, especially\nby the sensitive observation with the VLA in the A configuration. The single-dish upper\nlimit is 2 mJy, and the VLA upper limit is 0.13 mJy. Although we cannot rule out completely\nthe presence of an active nucleus, because the properties of NGC 1377 remain challenging,\nthe above arguments rather support our hypothesis of a nascent starburst.\nThe properties of NGC 4491 may in turn be indicative of non-stellar activity, because\nsome active nuclei are known to have flat radio spectra. Dust heating by an active nucleus\nis however very unlikely, owing to the following facts: NGC 4491 has no bulge; the velocity\ngradient inferred from the Pa\u03b2 line (see Section 4.1) is much less than 100 km s\u22121 , which\nconfirms that there is no central gravitational cusp (the inclination on the line of sight is\nabout 62\u25e6 ); optical and near-infrared emission lines do not give any indication of an active\nnucleus; the dust spectral energy distribution is fully consistent with the properties of starforming galaxies, whereas one would expect a high mid-infrared to far-infrared power ratio\nif dust were heated by an active nucleus.\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\n8.\n\nFrequency of occurrence\n\nOther high-q galaxies, deviating by more than 3\u03c3 from the average infrared to radio flux\nratio, are known, though NGC 1377 is the most extreme case. Among the sample studied by\nVader et al. (1993) in a series of papers, comprised of galaxies whose flux density is higher\nat 60 \u03bcm than at 100 \u03bcm, 31 lie in the NVSS sky coverage (including NGC 1377); of these\n31, we find that five galaxies satisfy the above high-q criterion.\nOf the 40 very luminous galaxies belonging to the IRAS bright galaxy sample (F60 >\n5.24 Jy and log(LFIR /L\u2299 ) > 11.25), Condon et al. (1991b) have found three more high-q\ngalaxies, which are distant (200 to 300 Mpc) and whose flux densities peak at 60 \u03bcm; they\nclassify them as compact starbursts. The activity of two of them is obviously driven by\non-going mergers, with double nuclei separated by less than 5\u2032\u2032 (Scoville et al. 2000), and the\nthird galaxy presents a strong warp (Lehnert & Heckman 1995). However, Condon et al.\n(1991b) claim that their radio deficiency is best explained by high free-free opacity at 20 cm,\nrather than a lack of cosmic rays.\nNine galaxies with q > 3 are mentioned by Yun et al. (2001) in a complete sample\nof 1809 galaxies with F60 > 2 Jy (i.e. with an occurrence rate of 0.5%), two of which in\ncommon with Condon et al. (1991b). However, reexamining these galaxies, we find that five\nof them are false high-q detections, due partly to confusion affecting IRAS fluxes, and partly\nto NVSS catalog fluxes missing low-surface brightness or extended structures. On the other\nhand, Yun et al. (2001) have missed NGC 1377, NGC 4491 and two galaxies of the sample of\nVader et al. (1993), which, according to the selection criteria of Yun et al. (2001), must be\npart of their sample and have q > 3. Because of inevitable errors due to automatic handling\nof very large samples, the census of high-q galaxies they provide is therefore uncertain. The\ntwo new high-q galaxies that they found have F60 /F100 ratios of \u2248 0.9 and 1.44 .\nIn view of the above numbers, it seems that the most efficient way of finding synchrotrondeficient galaxies is to select high dust temperatures (F60 /F100 \u2265 0.8 for all known highq galaxies), and that the infrared luminosity matters much less. The occurrence rate in\nthe color-selected sample of Vader et al. (1993) is as high as 16%. 60 \u03bcm-peakers being\nscarce objects, however, the implied probability for a random local galaxy to be synchrotrondeficient must be very low. The flux-limited sample of Condon et al. (1990) and Condon et\nal. (1996) (500 galaxies with F60 > 5.24 Jy) contains at least 6 high-q galaxies identified in\nthe above various samples, which implies a rate of the order of 1%.\nThe incidence of high dust temperatures is an additional argument in favor of the\nnascent starburst hypothesis that we have developed for NGC 1377, IC 1953 and NGC 4491.\nIn this scenario, the scarcity of high-q galaxies derives naturally from the timescales involved.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nThe likelihood for a galaxy to have a high q ratio is the product of the probabilities of two\noccurrences: it has to have been quiescent for at least 108 years, and a starburst has to have\nstarted less than 3\u20134 Myr before the epoch of observation. Less than \u2248 15% of opticallyselected galaxies have infrared color excesses indicative of on-going intense star formation, as\napparent from the analysis of Huang et al. (1996) (of their \"HP sample\"); from this we may\ninfer that galaxies spend, on average, less than 15% of the time in starburst events. Given\na typical starburst duration of f \u00d7 4 Myr, with f \u2265 1, the second probability listed above is\nnecessarily lower than 0.15/f . While the probability of the first occurrence (quiescence for\n108 years) is difficult to assess, it is sufficiently unlikely that high-q systems should be rare,\nconsistent with the statistics. However, at high redshifts, before the epoch of maximum star\nformation density, the probability of observing radio-deficient galaxies may be higher. It is\nunknown beyond what redshift metallicity effects, reducing the amount of dust and thus of\ninfrared emission, will start to compete with the nascent starburst effect. Garrett (2002)\nrecently estimated q ratios of distant galaxies (z up to 1.3) and found no significant deviation\nof the average from the local value.\n\n8.1.\n\nTriggering mechanisms\n\nThe data shown in this paper are consistent with the high infrared to radio flux ratios\nbeing caused by a delay in either the magnetic field strength or the cosmic ray density, in\neither case a consequence of a nascent starburst.\nIn contrast to the above infrared-luminous galaxies, NGC 1377, NGC 4491 and IC 1953\nhave a shallow potential well, such that the triggering mechanism of a central starburst is not\nobvious. In IC 1953, tidal interaction, likely at work, could be responsible for strengthening\nthe bar perturbation (which seems unusually strong for the morphological type of IC 1953)\nand causing massive gas inflow due to the bar potential. In this view, we would be witnessing the first burst caused by the bar, and IC 1953 will likely have an earlier-type aspect\nafterwards. NGC 4491 is also strongly barred, and this bar may also have grown due to tidal\nforces with other Virgo galaxies. However, no evidence of a bar nor of an intrusion exists\nin the most extreme galaxy of the three, NGC 1377. Are tidal interactions experienced by\ngalaxies in clusters and groups efficient at producing gas inflows inside them, even in the\nabsence of any visible potential perturbation ? Other HI-deficient and non-Seyfert Virgo\ngalaxies, besides NGC 4491, indeed have surprisingly high mid-infrared colors in their centers: N4293, N4569, N4579 (Roussel et al. 2001b). Note that all these galaxies either lie close\nto M 87 in projection and have radial velocities more than 600 km s\u22121 away from the velocity\ncentroid (Cayatte et al. 1990), or lie at the periphery of the cluster in projection, which could\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nmean that they are part of a very turbulent subsystem. Helou et al. (1989) found such an\nenvironmental effect in the Virgo unrelaxed subsystem called W, where blue compact dwarf\ngalaxies are more numerous and have hotter dust than in the rest of the cluster.\nHidden perturbations are best revealed by observing the HI morphology and velocity\nstructure, but NGC 1377 seems to have too little HI gas for such a diagnostic to be applied.\nAn assessment of the nature and cause of the activity seen in the three galaxies will have to\nwait for complementary data.\n\n9.\n\nSummary and final remarks\n\nIn order to understand the cause of the synchrotron deficiency observed in the three\nclosest high-q galaxies, we have presented and analysed extensive data in several windows:\nbroadband dust emission, radio continuum at several frequencies, emission line diagnostics\nof photon ionization, supernova shocks and hot molecular gas excitation, and emission of the\ncold molecular gas.\nWe argued that the galaxies are seen at the very onset of a starburst episode, following\na long period of quiescence, based on these data, and consistent with the statistics of highq galaxies inferred from starburst timescales. In this scenario, cosmic rays generated by\npast star formation had the time to decay, and massive stars produced by the current star\nformation episode have not evolved into supernovae yet (NGC 1377, central region of IC 1953)\nor, in the case of NGC 4491, the supernova rate is still rising and the cosmic ray population\nis in its formative stages.\nAll three galaxies host unusually hot dust, requiring an intense radiation field consistent\nwith that produced by a young starburst. NGC 1377, whose properties are the most peculiar,\nis not only devoid of synchrotron radiation, but also of free-free emission. We propose that\nthe starburst is so young that massive stars are still accreting material, preventing the\ndevelopment of HII regions. Along the same line, dust emission in the mid-infrared has\nan unusual spectral signature, suggesting that grains were processed differently from grains\nfound in almost every other star formation environment; the molecular gas disk may be\novercritical, which would explain the quasi-instantaneous trigger of a starburst. While this\nis the most likely explanation, the properties of NGC 1377 remain very intriguing.\nWe can rule out abnormal initial mass function, electron opacity and fast synchrotron\nlosses as causes of the depressed radio continuum. Other scenarios are not formally ruled out,\nbut create serious difficulties: radio-quiet Seyfert activity is unlikely owing to the energetics\narguments discussed in Section 7.5; a weak magnetic field (relevant only for NGC 1377) is\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\npossible, but difficult to explain in light of what is known of turbulent field amplification,\nand still requires a young starburst after a period of quiescence.\nWe would like to stress that the galaxies studied in this paper are not akin to irregular or\nblue compact dwarf galaxies, which would at first sight be easily susceptible of synchrotron\ndeficiency for various reasons: fast cosmic ray escape and interstellar medium disruption and\nloss; evidence of optically-thick free-free emission in some of them. Although these galaxies\nseem to have much more dispersed infrared to radio flux ratios than spirals, they follow the\nsame average relationship and none of them is known to deviate from it significantly.\nAmong galaxies of the IRAS bright galaxy sample, selected by their 60 \u03bcm flux, the\noccurrence rate of high-q galaxies (in our interpretation nascent starbursts) is of the order of\n1% or slightly more. The best way to select these galaxies is to search for high dust temperatures; no other simple criterion is evident. Although very few examples are known, from\nthis phenomenon arises a potential problem for the identification of distant infrared galaxies with high-resolution radio observations, especially with possibly changing star formation\ntimescales at high redshifts.\nThe galaxies studied here offer a unique glimpse at starbursts during a critical period\nof their evolution, and will allow us to address questions concerning the pre-starburst accumulation of molecular material, the triggering mechanisms, the spatial development of a\nstarburst, and the start, build-up and evolution of a cosmic ray population.\nWe are grateful to Antonio Garc\u0131\u0301a-Barreto for providing us his (H\u03b1+[NII]) and I-band\nmaps of IC 1953, to Sangeeta Malhotra for mentioning the peculiar infrared properties of\nNGC 4418, thereby arousing our curiousity, to the persons who assisted us in the observations\nat Effelsberg, Palomar and La Silla, and to James Brauher for communicating us some fluxes\nin advance of publication. This publication makes use of data products from the Two Micron\nAll Sky Survey, which is a joint project of the University of Massachusetts and IPAC/Caltech,\nfunded by NASA and the National Science Foundation. The ISOCAM data presented in\nthis paper were analyzed using and adapting the CIA package, a joint development by the\nESA Astrophysics Division and the ISOCAM Consortium. This research also benefited from\nthe NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), which is operated by the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory of Caltech.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\nA.\n\nPIFS observations\n\nIn February, exposures times were 300 s for all lines but [FeII] in NGC 4491, for which\nit was increased to 400 s. Except for the beginning of Feb. 1, the sky was very clear, and\nthe observations were photometric. Star number 9148 in Persson et al. (1998) was used\nas a photometric standard. In October, exposure times for NGC 1377 and NGC 1022 were\nrespectively 260 and 220 s for all lines; the flux calibration was performed with 2MASS\nimages.\nThe field of view of PIFS is sliced into eight slits, 0.67\u2032\u2032 -wide and 9.7\u2032\u2032 -long. We dithered\nto reconstruct cross-slit spatial information, and obtained maps of 5.8\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 , with a pixel\nsize of 0.167\u2032\u2032 . The high-resolution grating yields resolutions between 950 and 1500 at the\nwavelengths of interest.\nObservations were carried out as outlined in the PIFS manual (which can be found\nin http://www.its.caltech.edu/ btsoifer/pifs/). The flat-field and atmospheric transmission\nfunction was calibrated by sweeping G0V\u2013G8V stars across the array with the chopping\nsecondary, using a fast triangle wave, at the same airmass as the galaxy to within 10%. The\nsame stars were chopped in the cross-slit direction in order to establish a flux reference and\nto calibrate spatial curvature. Noble gas spectra served to correct for spectral distorsion\nand fit the wavelength function. The data reduction consists of the following steps: (1)\ndefine a mask for bad pixels and cosmic rays; (2) subtract the bias for each quadrant of the\narray; (3) subtract the sky, tying the OH line intensities in the off-source spectra to their\nintensities in the on-source spectra (in the edges of the field, where the contribution from\nthe galaxy is minimal); (4) divide spectra by the flat-field and atmospheric function; (5)\nconstruct a wavevelength map using the noble gas spectra; (6) correct for the spectral and\nspatial distortions, and combine the rectified spectra in a cube. Table 5 offers a summary\nof observing parameters and measured fluxes. In order to minimize residuals from OH sky\nlines in the faint spectra of NGC 4491, we subtracted the spectral variations of an off-center\nregion around its average flux density.\n\nB.\n\nSEST observations\n\nWe used dual beam switching, and connected the IRAM 115/230 receivers to the lowresolution acousto-optical spectrometers. The initial velocity resolution was 3.6 km s\u22121 and\n1.8 km s\u22121 , respectively. System temperatures ranged between 200 K and 400 K at 230 GHz\nand between 230 K and 460 K at 115 GHz. The beam width is 45\u2032\u2032 at 115 GHz and 23\u2032\u2032 at\n230 GHz. Baseline fitting and removal in each separate spectrum, and averaging of spectra\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\nobtained at the same position were performed with the CLASS software, which is developed\nby the Observatoire de Grenoble and IRAM. We used main beam efficiencies of 0.7 at 115 GHz\nand 0.5 at 230 GHz, and a forward efficiency of 0.9 .\nPointing corrections were determined on the closest bright SiO masers, o Ceti and\nOrion SiO, twice per observing session, at the beginning and after sunset. These sources are\nrespectively about 15\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 away from NGC 1377 in azimuth, and about 15\u25e6 away to the\nnorth. Due to these large distances, the pointing accuracy is likely degraded with respect to\nthe quoted value of 3\u2032\u2032 rms in azimuth and elevation. Furthermore, a hardware limit obliged\nus to rotate the antenna by 360\u25e6 in azimuth once per night; because the CO(2-1) spectrum\nobtained on the center of NGC 1377 before the rotation was not reproduced within the error\nbar after the rotation, we suspect that this introduced additional pointing errors, and we\ndiscarded the redundant data obtained after rotating the antenna.\nIn order to know whether the CO source is extended, we performed minimal mapping,\nintegrating on the galaxy center and eight adjacent positions stepped by half the CO(21) beam width. The spectra are shown in Figure 11. The resulting eighteen total flux\nmeasurements were least-squares-fitted with a gaussian source of adjustable width, allowing\nfor some random pointing errors of up to 3\u2032\u2032 at each position, plus some systematic larger\npointing errors after each large rotation of the antenna. If no systematic errors are allowed,\nthen the fit is not acceptable (normalized \u03c72 > 8). We can reproduce the data provided\nthese systematic pointing errors are of the order of 5\u2032\u2032 or slightly more. The best fit is then\nalways obtained for the smallest source size of the explored grid. Due to the large beams,\nthis parameter is not well constrained, but the derived total fluxes are robust results.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarnes D.G., Staveley-Smith L., de Blok W.J. et al., 2001, MNRAS 322, 486\nBeck R., 2001, SSRv 99, 243\nBeck R., Brandenburg A., Moss D., Shukurov A. & Sokoloff D., 1996, ARA&A 34, 155\nBeck R. & Golla G., 1988, A&A 191, L9\nBeck S.C., Turner J.L. & Kovo O., 2000, AJ 120, 244\nBeichman C.A., Soifer B.T., Helou G. et al., 1986, ApJ 308, L1\nBianchi S., Davies J.I. & Alton P.B., 1999, A&A 344, L1\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\nBicay M.D. & Helou G., 1990, ApJ 362, 59\nBinggeli B.& Cameron L.M., 1993, A&AS 98, 297\nBinggeli B., Popescu C.C. & Tammann G.A., 1993, A&AS 98, 275\nBoselli A., Casoli F. & Lequeux J., 1995, A&AS 110, 521\nBrauher J., 2002, in preparation\nBurrows D.N., Singh K.P., Nousek J.A., Garmire G.P. & Good J., 1993, ApJ 406, 97\nCagnoni I., della Ceca R. & Maccacaro T., 1998, ApJ 493, 54\nCardelli J.A., Clayton G.C. & Mathis J.S., 1989, ApJ 345, 245\nCarilli C.L. & Barthel P.D., 1996, A&ARv 7, 1\nCayatte V., van Gorkom J.H., Balkowski C. & Kotanyi C., 1990, AJ 100, 604\nChapman S.C., Helou G., Lewis G.F. & Dale D.A., 2002, submitted to ApJ\nClark D.H. & Caswell J.L., 1976, MNRAS 174, 267\nColina L., Bohlin R.C. & Castelli F., 1996, AJ 112, 307\nCombes F., Prugniel P., Rampazzo R. & Sulentic J.W., 1994, A&A 281, 725\nCondon J.J., Cotton W.D. & Broderick J.J., 2002a, AJ 124, 675\nCondon J.J., Helou G. & Jarrett T.H., 2002b, AJ 123, 1881\nCondon J.J., Cotton W.D., Greisen E.W. et al., 1998, AJ 115, 1693\nCondon J.J.
