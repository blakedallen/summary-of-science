The monomers\nin both crystals are hydrogen bonded;10,11,12,13,14 it is a\ndirectional and anisotropic bonding of the hydrogen in a\nHF and HCl monomer to the fluorine or chlorine atom,\nrespectively, of a neighboring monomer. The bonding is\ncaused by a partial withdrawal of charge from the hydrogen atom due to the high electronegativity of the fluorine or chlorine atoms.10,11,12,13,14 Hydrogen bonds are\nintermediates between ionic bonding and van der Waals\nbonding and are of great importance for the physical and\nchemical properties of many organic and inorganic crystals. Moreover, they turn out to be crucial for the structure of many biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic\nacids.10,11,12,13,14\nAt low temperature, HF and HCl crystals are structurally very similar. While HF forms strong hydrogen bonds, HCl forms weak hydrogen bonds. Therefore, HF and HCl represent good candidates for a thorough analysis of this special type of bonding in crystals. The monomers in both compounds are found to\nbe arranged in terms of parallel zigzag chains with a\nlarge interchain distance and, hence, a weak interchain\ninteraction [see Sec. III for details]. Frequently, a single infinite chain is considered as a simple but realistic model of the crystals. The isolated (HF)\u221e chain\nhas fascinated many theoreticians and much work has\nbeen carried out dealing with it; namely, model studies,15,16 semiempirical (intermediate neglect of differential overlap) examinations of (HF)\u221e by Zunger,17 density functional theory calculations [local density approximation] of Springborg,15,16 and ab initio investigations.18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 In contrast,\nthe (HCl)\u221e chain has not been investigated very extensively; there are only a few ab initio examinations.20,21,34,35 For both isolated chains the zigzag geometry of Fig. 1 is the energetically favored arrange-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Structure of infinite (HF)\u221e zigzag\nchains. The structure of (HCl)\u221e chains is analogous. The\ngrey (red) numbers below the monomers indicate the relative position of a monomer in the chain with respect to the\nmonomer \"0\" at the origin.\n\nment in comparison with the linear geometry. For (HF)\u221e\nchains this has been shown in early studies of Karpfen et\nal.19,23 and Beyer and Karpfen.25 The structure of isolated (HCl)\u221e chains is investigated in Ref. 35.\nThe large number of ab initio studies that have been\ncarried out for the chains also exhibits how challenging\nhydrogen-bonded systems are. An accurate treatment\nof hydrogen bonds requires both a good electron correlation method and a large one-particle basis set.32,33,36\nHence, in Refs. 32,33, we applied basis set extrapolation\nschemes-which are powerful methods to improve the\naccuracy of both Hartree-Fock and correlation energies\nfor small molecules-to extended systems, showing their\nvalidity and usefulness also in this situation. Thereby,\na periodic Hartree-Fock treatment was accompanied by\ncorrelation calculations.\nWe use the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)\ncorrelation method37 in conjunction with the incremental scheme38,39,40,41,42 which has been used in many\napplications and yields a physically meaningful manybody decomposition of the correlation energy. It has\nbeen applied to a few one-dimensional systems before:\nthe trans-polyacetylene polymer,43 the infinite lithium\nhydride chain,44 the beryllium hydride polymer,44 and\npoly(para-phenylene).45 In the context of the present paper, the contributions of Doll et al.,46,47,48,49 who studied ionic solids, as well as the investigations of rare-gas\n\n\f2\ncrystals by Ro\u015bciszewski et al.50,51 are worth mentioning\nbecause hydrogen-bonded crystals fall in between these\ntwo types of bonding.\nThis paper is structured as follows. The CCSD electron correlation method and the incremental scheme are\nintroduced in Sec. II whereas Sec. III describes geometries, basis sets, and the computer programs employed.\nIn Sec. IV, we discuss electron correlation effects and\ntheir implications. The contributions to the binding energy of the (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains are evaluated in\nSec.

(5) run only over distinct sets of one-body\norbital sets.\nThe translational relation of the Wannier orbitals leads\nto the translational symmetry of the energy increments,\ni.e., \u2206\u03b5~0 I1 ***R~ K \u2212R~ 1 IK = \u2206\u03b5R~ 1 I1 ***R~ K IK . This can be exploited in Eq. (5) to make the right-hand\nside of Eq. (5)\nP\nindependent of the first lattice sum\nwhich, for this rea~1\nR\n\nson, is N0 times the sum of the translational symmetryadapted energy increments. It allows us to eliminate the\nfactor N0 in front of the left-hand side of Eq. (5) and enormously reduces the number of energy increments that\nneed to be calculated to describe the chains with a given\naccuracy.\nThe localized occupied molecular orbitals of oligomers,\ncomprising a few monomers arranged in the geometry of\nthe infinite chains, are found to be a good approximation to the Wannier orbitals of infinite chains and crystals.38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45 This facilitates the determination\nof the correlation contribution to the binding energy of\ninfinite chains from the energy increments in oligomers\nusing Eq. (5). Yet the virtual Wannier orbitals involved\nin the determination of the energy increments, and implicitly contained in Eq. (6), are replaced by all the virtual canonical molecular orbitals of the oligomers. The\nprocedure outlined in this paragraph is termed the incremental scheme.38,39,40,41,42\n\nIII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nHydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride crystallize in\nan orthorhombic low-temperature phase described by the\nspace groups Bm21 b for HF,1,2,3 and Bb21 m for HCl.7,8,9\nThe unit cells of both crystals contain four monomers\nwhich are arranged in terms of weakly interacting parallel\nzigzag chains [Fig. 1]. The chains are described by a unit\ncell which comprises two monomers and are considered as\nan excellent one-dimensional model for HF and HCl crystals.15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\nThe structure of a single chain is determined by three parameters, the H-X distance r, the X * * * X distance R,\nand the angle \u03b1 = 6 (HXH), X = F,Cl. Experimental\nvalues for the parameters are r = 0.92 \u00c5, R = 2.50 \u00c5, and\n\u03b1 = 120\u25e6 for (HF)\u221e ,1,56 and r = 1.25 \u00c5, R = 3.688 \u00c5,\nand \u03b1 = 93.3\u25e6 for (DCl)\u221e .7 HCl and deuterated DCl\ncrystals have very similar lattice constants and are\nconsidered to be isomorphous.7 Unfortunately, further\nstructural information for HCl crystals is unavailable.\n\nTo calculate the energy increments in Eq. (5), we\nperform molecular calculations on oligomers (HF)n and\n(HCl)n , respectively, i.e., short fragments of the chains.\nWe utilize the program package molpro,57 employing\nFoster-Boys localization58,59 of the molecular orbitals\nand the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) correlation method.37,57,60 Thereby, we are consistent with\nRefs. 32,33 where also the CCSD method was employed.\nWe use the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set61,62,63,64 which yields\nsomewhat less accurate total binding energies than those\nobtained in Refs. 32,33. Yet we are mainly interested\nin the long-range behavior of electron correlations in the\nhydrogen-bonded chains; it is well described by the augcc-pVDZ basis set due to vanishingly small geometrical orbital overlaps among the one-body orbital sets in\nthe K-body energy increments considered. In fact, the\nmodulus of the two-body energy increment involving the\nthird-nearest-neighbor monomer |\u03b503 |, as obtained with\nthe aug-cc-pVDZ basis set,61,62,63,64 is smaller by 2%\nfor (HF)\u221e and by 4% for (HCl)\u221e than |\u03b503 | obtained\nwith the larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis set61,62,63,64 [Sec. IV].\nSimilarly, K-body energy increments for K \u2265 3 agree\nwell as soon as the geometrical orbital overlaps between\nthe one-body orbital sets become negligible.\n\nIn Tab. III below, reference is made to periodic\nHartree-Fock calculations of (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains,\ndescribed in Refs. 32,33, which were carried out with\nthe crystal program.65,66,67 For these calculations, the\nf, g, h, i functions were removed from the basis sets. To\nestimate the influence of the neglected basis functions\non the total binding energy of the chains, we use molpro,57 to calculate the Hartree-Fock binding energy per\nmonomer for (HF)9 and (HCl)9 both with and without\nf, g, h functions using the cc-pV5Z basis set;61,63,64 at the\nHartree-Fock level it is close to completeness with respect\nto basis functions with the angular momenta s, p, d. The\nbinding energies of both chains obtained with f, g, h functions are smaller by \u2248 13 \u03bcEh than those determined\nwithout them. This deviation turns out to be sufficiently\nsmall to be neglected in the subsequent calculation of total binding energies in Sec. V. However, note that for\nthe correlation calculations the f, g, h functions are fully\nconsidered.\n\nThe calculated binding energies reported here account\nfor the basis set superposition error68 (BSSE) by the\ncounterpoise correction (CP); it is determined by surrounding an isolated HF or HCl monomer by sufficiently\nmany ghost atoms positioned in the geometry of the infinite chains.68,69\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) One-body energy increments \u2206\u03b50\nof (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains as determined in oligomers of\nvarying length reduced by the CP-corrected correlation encorr\nergy Emon\nof the corresponding isolated monomer. The mean\nvalue of the two innermost energy increments of the oligomers\nis taken. Circles stand for (HF)\u221e and squares for (HCl)\u221e\ndata. Open symbols refer to oligomers surrounded by point\ncharges whereas closed symbols denote isolated oligomers.\n\nIV.\n\nELECTRON CORRELATIONS\nA.\n\nTransferability\n\nWe have to ensure that the Foster-Boys-localized\nmolecular orbitals58,59 which are extracted from\noligomers are a good approximation to the Wannier orbitals of the infinite (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains. They\nhave to be approximately translationally related within a\ncertain oligomer and must not differ substantially among\noligomers of varying length. These two properties of the\nlocalized occupied molecular orbitals are termed transferability. In order to achieve transferability for moderately sized molecular clusters, one is frequently obliged to\naccount for the omitted monomers in terms of an appropriate substitute. In the case of (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e , two\noptions offer themselves. On the one hand, both chains\nare cut out from a molecular crystal, implying no substitutes as in rare-gas crystals;50,51 on the other hand,\nparticularly (HF)\u221e is rather ionic and a surrounding by\npoint charges can be envisaged to create the embedding\nwhich adequately models the infinite chains.46,47,48,49,70\nI explore both possibilities to elucidate what kind of procedure is adequate for hydrogen-bonded solids. The virtual orbitals of the oligomers are not altered and remain\ncanonical molecular orbitals in the calculation of the individual energy increments. The oligomer approximation\nthus corresponds to a sort of domain decomposition of\nthe virtual space which also is applied in other local correlation methods.71\nIn the case of (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e , the outer and inner valence orbitals, i.e., eight electrons, are assigned to\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Two-body energy increments \u2206\u03b501\nof (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains as determined in oligomers of\nvarying length. The two innermost one-body orbital sets of\nthe respective oligomer are taken to determine \u2206\u03b501 . Symbols\nare chosen as in Fig. 2.\n\nthe one-body orbital set representing a particular HF or\nHCl monomer (4). To test the transferability, we calculate all one-body energy increments and all two-body energy increments between two adjacent monomers, the socalled connected two-body energy increments, in isolated\noligomers (HF)n and (HCl)n for n = 2, 4, 6, 10. They are\ncompared with the energy increments from the oligomers\nwhich were surrounded by point charges up to twentiethnearest neighbors. The hydrogen atoms are represented\nby q = +1; fluorine and chlorine atoms are described\nby q = \u22121 with the exception of the terminal charges\nwhich are set to q = \u2212 21 .46,47,48,49,70\nComparing the one-body and the connected twobody energy increments obtained in oligomers of varying\nlength in Figs. 2 and 3, we observe a rapid convergence\nof their values toward the limit of the infinite chains\nwhere the values determined for the isolated oligomers\nand the values resulting from the point-charge-embedded\noligomers approach each other quickly. The energy increments taken from the isolated oligomers increase (decrease) in Fig. 2 (Fig. 3) monotonically with the oligomer\nlength whereas the embedding with point charges causes\nan unsystematic but quicker convergence. The convergence behavior of the individual curves in Figs. 2 and 3\nis governed by a small variation in the localized orbitals\nand, predominantly, by the improvement of the electronic\nstructure which approaches rapidly the electronic structure of the infinite chains with increasing length of the\noligomers. Obviously, the decision whether to employ\npoint charges or not has only a small impact on the values of the energy increments. The one-body (two-body)\nenergy increments differ by 67 \u03bcEh (14 \u03bcEh ) in (HF)\u221e\nand by 22 \u03bcEh (31 \u03bcEh ) in (HCl)\u221e .

The\nenergy increments are computed using the one-body orbital\nsets of the innermost monomers in the oligomers. All data\nare given in millihartrees.\n\nThe error on the binding energy due to the approximate translational relation of the Wannier orbitals taken\nfrom the finite-length oligomers can be estimated by investigating the numerical differences between energy increments whose values should be identical due to (translational) symmetry. The connected two-body increments, for example, vary at most by 40 \u03bcEh in (HF)10\nand at most by 11 \u03bcEh in (HCl)10 .78 We conclude that\nthe transferability prerequisite of the energy increments\nis satisfied within good accuracy. The agreement between the results obtained in the two different ways described before corroborates the applicability of oligomers\nto represent the electronic structure of infinite (HF)\u221e\nand (HCl)\u221e chains.\n\nB.\n\nShort-range correlations\n\nLet us discuss the short-range correlation contributions\nfirst. The most relevant energy increments of (HF)\u221e and\n(HCl)\u221e are summarized in Tab. I. The CP-corrected correlation energy of the HF monomer, \u2212227.3406 mEh , and\nof the HCl monomer, \u2212176.2151 mEh , are only larger in\nmagnitude by 1.8% and 0.6%, respectively, than the corresponding one-body energy increments \u2206\u03b50 . They are\na bit larger because the electrons of a monomer in the\nchains experience Pauli repulsion exerted by the neighboring monomers. However, these effects are small in\nour case and the electronic structure of the HF and\nHCl monomers is essentially preserved in the (HF)\u221e and\n(HCl)\u221e chains.\nThe K-body energy increments, K \u2265 2, describe the\nmutual correlation of the valence electrons of several\nmonomers. They give rise to a pronounced nonlinear\nincrease of the binding energy of small clusters and short\noligomers which is termed bond cooperativity (Ref. 14\nand references therein). The modulus of the connected\ntwo-body energy increment of (HCl)\u221e , |\u2206\u03b5HCl\n01 |, is 31%\nsmaller than the modulus of the corresponding energy\nincrement of (HF)\u221e , |\u2206\u03b5HF\n01 |. The connected three-body\nenergy increment \u2206\u03b5HCl\n012 is repulsive, i.e., greater than\nis\nagain\nattractive, i.e., smaller than\nzero, but \u2206\u03b5HF\n012\n\nCompound C6odd\n(HF)\u221e\n23.4\n(HCl)\u221e 121\n\nC6even\n20.2\n120\n\nExperimenta\n19.00\n130.4\n\na The experimental data are taken from Ref. 73; it is a rotational\naverage of the van der Waals constants for the dispersion interaction between two isolated monomers.\n\nTABLE II: Van der Waals constants C6odd and C6even of the\ntwo-body dispersion interaction for the (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e\nchains. They are obtained by fitting the two-body energy increments of Fig. 4 with either odd or even cardinal numbers n,\nrespectively, to Eq. (7). All data are given in hartree bohr6 .\n\nzero. The reverse trend is observed for the remaining\nenergy increments. The modulus of the energy increHF\nment \u2206\u03b5HCl\n02 is 57% larger than |\u2206\u03b502 |. The connected\nHCl\nfour-body increment \u2206\u03b50123 is 100% larger than \u2206\u03b5HF\n0123\nand both are repulsive. These two trends of the energy increments can be explained by two effects. First,\nshort-range correlation is effective for nearest neighbors\n[see also the ensuing Sec. IV C]; it is apparently stronger\nin (HF)\u221e than in (HCl)\u221e due to the tighter packing of\nthe monomers in (HF)\u221e and the higher compactness of\nthe HF monomer itself. Second, chlorine atoms have a\nhigher polarizability than fluorine atoms because their\nvalence electrons are more diffuse than those of the latter atom. This causes the van der Waals interaction to\nbe stronger in (HCl)\u221e than in (HF)\u221e ,72 leading to the\nmore distant energy increments being larger in (HCl)\u221e\nwhen compared with (HF)\u221e ; all this despite the larger\nintermonomer distances in (HCl)\u221e than in (HF)\u221e .\nHowever, note that one should not associate too much\nphysics with the particular values of energy increments;\nnamely, they depend on the specific unitary transformation used to localize the occupied orbitals (here the one of\nFoster and Boys58,59 ). Only the binding energy, which involves the sum of all the energy increments [Eqs. (9) and\n(10)], is a physical observable and thus invariant under\norbital transformations. When an analysis of the individual energy increments is to be meaningful, their value\nshould be fairly independent of the localization procedure\nwhich is well satisfied in our case.\n\nC.\n\nLong-range correlations\n\nAt a separation of two isolated monomers where the geometrical overlap between the orbitals from distinct onebody orbital sets of the monomers becomes negligible,\nonly van der Waals dispersion interactions remain. This\nis also the case for the interaction between two monomers\nin the infinite chains which is correspondingly described\nby the two-body energy increments. Their absolute values in (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e for two monomers at a distance up to seventh nearest neighbors are displayed in\nFig. 4; the curves drop off rapidly with distance.\nThe monomers in Fig. 1 that are labeled by odd cardi-\n\n\f6\nnal numbers are tilted with respect to monomer 0. Likewise, monomers with even cardinal numbers are arranged\nparallel to the monomer 0. We will refer to the two types\nof two-body energy increments that result from a parallel\nor tilted setting of monomers as even or odd energy increments, respectively. The long-range interaction between\ntwo monomers is approximated by the leading term of\nthe two-body van der Waals dispersion interaction72,74\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2212 Cn6odd6 , n odd\n( 2 a)\nvdW\n(7)\n\u03b50 n =\neven\n\uf8f3 \u2212 Cn6 6 , n even ,\n( 2 a)\n\nwhere individual van der Waals constants C6odd and\nC6even , respectively, are affixed for odd and even energy\nincrements. Here a represents the lattice constant of the\nchains. The van der Waals constants are obtained by a\nweighted nonlinear curve fit75 of the data in Fig. 4 for either the odd or the even energy increments. The weights\nare chosen such that the fit reproduces the energy increments with large n best, as for them the geometrical\norbital overlaps between the orbitals from two different\none-body orbital sets are negligible. The van der Waals\nconstants for the fits of the two sets of translationally\nequivalent monomers are given in Tab. II. Our theoretical data compare satisfactorily with the experimental\ndata for the dispersion interaction between two isolated\nmonomers also given in the table.\nHaving identified the van der Waals contribution to the\ntwo-body energy increments in the chains, we can subtract it from the two-body energy increments to obtain\nvan der Waals-reduced energy increments\n\u2206\u03b5vdW\n= \u2206\u03b50n \u2212 \u03b5vdW\n.\n0n\n0n\n|\u2206\u03b5vdW\n0n |\n\n(8)\n\nTheir absolute value\nis shown next to the absolute value of the two-body energy increments |\u2206\u03b50n | in\nFig. 4.\nTwo regions can be identified in Fig. 4. First, from\nthe nearest to the third-nearest neighbors, there is the\nlocal correlation zone, where, due to geometrical orbital\noverlaps, short-range electron correlations are effective.\nThere, the decay of two-body energy increments with the\ndistance between the two monomers is faster than the one\nthat would result from a pure van der Waals interaction,\nfollowing Eq. (7). We observe that the van der Waals\ncontribution to |\u2206\u03b5vdW\n01 | of (HCl)\u221e is appreciably larger\nthan in (HF)\u221e as the curves for |\u2206\u03b501 | and |\u2206\u03b5vdW\n01 | are\nmuch closer for (HCl)\u221e than for (HF)\u221e . Second, there\nis the van der Waals zone reaching from the third- up to\nthe seventh-nearest neighbor. Here a typical r\u22126 decay is\nobserved, leading to van der Waals-reduced energy increments that are essentially zero. A slight deviation of the\ntwo-body energy increments from an r\u22126 behavior is perceived beyond fifth-nearest neighbors which likely can be\nattributed to inaccuracies caused by the oligomer approximation. The translational relation of the Wannier orbitals is better satisfied in (HCl)\u221e compared with (HF)\u221e\n[Sec. IV A] which leads to a lower absolute value of the\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Absolute values of two-body energy increments |\u2206\u03b50 n | (closed symbols) and van der Waals-reduced\ntwo-body energy increments |\u2206\u03b5vdW\n0 n | (open symbols) using\nEq. (7) and the constants in Tab. II for both the (HF)\u221e chain\n(circles) and the (HCl)\u221e chain (squares).\n\nfourth to seventh van der Waals-reduced energy increments. The low absolute value of \u2206\u03b5vdW\nfor both chains\n06\nis an artifact of the fitting process. Figure 4 also reveals\nthat the two-body energy increments are of satisfactory\naccuracy even beyond the estimates given in Sec. IV A\nof 40 \u03bcEh for (HF)10 and 11 \u03bcEh for (HCl)10 due to a\nconsiderable error cancellation.\nGiven the van der Waals constants in Tab. II, we\ncan use Eq. (7) to sum up the van der Waals contribution of the two-body energy increments to the bind\u221e\nP\ning energy to infinite distance\n\u03b5vdW\nwhich yields\n0n\nn=3\n\n\u22128 \u03bcEh for (HF)\u221e and \u221212 \u03bcEh for (HCl)\u221e . The bigger\npolarizability of chlorine atoms compared with fluorine\natoms leads to the larger contribution in (HCl)\u221e when\ncompared with (HF)\u221e as can be expected from the analysis of the energy increments in Sec. IV B. The contribution of two-body energy increments beyond third-nearest\nneighbors is in both cases \u2248 30% of \u2206\u03b50 3 .\nGenerally, once a good estimate of the van der Waals\nconstants of a crystal is available, the decomposition of\nthe energy increments into a short- and a long-range van\nder Waals contribution can be made. This allows one\nto focus on the short-range part. Thereby, the required\nnumber of energy increments to be calculated to reach\na certain accuracy of the correlation energy is reduced\nconsiderably. Therefore, the computational demand of\nits determination is also significantly decreased.\n\nV.\n\nBINDING ENERGY\n\nHaving understood the impact of electron correlations\nin (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains, we are now in a position\nto examine the total binding energy per monomer \u2206E of\n\n\f7\nthe chains; it is given by\n\u2206E = \u2206ESCF + \u2206Ecorr\nSCF\ncorr\nSCF\ncorr\n= 21 (Echain\n+ Echain\n) \u2212 Emonomer\n\u2212 Emonomer\n.\n\n(9)\nIt consists of the Hartree-Fock and the correlation conSCF\ntributions \u2206ESCF and \u2206Ecorr , respectively, where Echain\ncorr\nand Echain denote the Hartree-Fock and correlation enerSCF\ngies per unit cell of the chains. Furthermore, Emonomer\ncorr\nand Emonomer\nare the corresponding energies for the\nmonomers. The Hartree-Fock energies are readily available from molecular and periodic calculations65,66,67 but\nelectron correlations are more involved and were discussed in the previous Sec. IV.\nIn Tab. III, we communicate basis-set-extrapolated\nHartree-Fock binding energies \u2206ESCF (\u221e) for the chains\ntaken from Refs. 32,33. At the Hartree-Fock equilibrium geometry of (HF)\u221e , Bayer and Karpfen\ngive \u221210.360 mEh for basis set 3 in Ref. 25 while Hirata\nand Iwata find \u221210.855 mEh for the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set.30 Both numbers are in good agreement with our\nresult which is \u221210.202 mEh . Yet Berski and Latajka report \u22129.696 mEh for (HF)\u221e , when using the 6-311G(d,p)\nbasis set,29 and \u22122.073 mEh for (HCl)\u221e harnessing the\nDZ(d,p) basis set.35 The latter number in particular deviates considerably from our result, \u22120.586 mEh , which\nis most likely due to the fact that they did not remove\nthe BSSE.29,35\nTo determine the correlation energy per monomer of\nthe infinite chains Ecorr , we inspect the energy increments\nin Tab. I. They converge rapidly both with increasing distance among the monomers involved and with increasing\norder of the many-body expansion, i.e., with the maximum number of monomers correlated in a specific energy increment. In order to obtain an accuracy in Ecorr\nof \u2248 50 \u03bcEh for (HF)\u221e and of \u2248 11 \u03bcEh for (HCl)\u221e , we\nsee from Tab. I that it is enough to include the following\nenergy increments:\nEcorr \u2248 \u2206\u03b50 + \u2206\u03b501 + \u2206\u03b502 .\n\n(10)\n\nHence, it is sufficient to correlate the electrons in\nthe Wannier orbitals of only two monomers at a\ntime for (HF)\u221e and (HCl)\u221e chains in which more\ndistant two-body energy increments contribute only\n\u22128 \u03bcEh for (HF)\u221e and \u221212 \u03bcEh for (HCl)\u221e as shown\nin Sec. IV C. In three-dimensional crystals, three-body\nterms become more important according to the analyses\nin Refs. 51,76,77 and the much larger number of threebody energy increments compared with the number of\ntwo-body energy increments.\nWe report \u2206E based on the approximation of Eq. (10)\nas obtained by basis-set extrapolation32,33 in Tab. III.\nUsing density functional theory, Hirata and Iwata30\nfind at optimized geometries for the total binding energy of (HF)\u221e \u221213.521 mEh (BLYP) and \u221213.864 mEh\n(B3LYP) [utilizing the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set] which\nare larger in magnitude by 14% and 17%, respectively,\nthan our result for the experimental geometry.

All data are taken from Refs. 32,33 and are given in\nmillihartrees.\n\nserved differences can be partially ascribed to the different geometries used; our experimental geometry leads to\na binding energy that is somewhat smaller in magnitude\nthan the binding energy in the optimized geometry. The\n6-311++G(d,p) basis set of Iwata and Hirata30 also differs substantially from our choices in Refs. 32,33. Above\nall, we do not consider the impact of triple excitations in\nour study; they increase the absolute value of the shortrange correlation contributions and, consequently, also\nthe absolute value of the binding energies.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe study hydrogen bonding in infinite (HF)\u221e and\n(HCl)\u221e chains. Whereas in (HF)\u221e the Hartree-Fock\ncontribution dominates the total binding energy by 86%\ndue to the electrostatic contribution of the rather ionic\nHF monomers, in the much more weakly bound (HCl)\u221e ,\nthe Hartree-Fock calculation yields only 18% of the binding energy [Tab. III]. The transitional character of\nhydrogen-bonded crystals between the ionic and van der\nWaals regimes is reflected in these numbers. The very\nweak hydrogen bonds in the (HCl)\u221e chains bear a close\nresemblance to purely van der Waals-bonded systems,\nlike rare-gas solids, where bonding is entirely caused\nby electron correlations.50,51,77 In fact only the inclusion of electron correlations puts the binding energy per\nmonomer of the (HCl)\u221e chain into the range conventionally ascribed to hydrogen bonding,11 namely 3\u201316 mEh .\nThe incremental scheme, which provides a decomposition of the contribution of electron correlations to\nthe binding energy of the chains in terms of nonadditive many-body energy increments, is shown to converge rapidly with respect to the number of monomers,\ni.e., bodies, involved in the energy increments and the\ndistance among them, thus providing a good tool to\nstudy hydrogen bonding in crystals. In contrast to\nthree-dimensional crystals, the dominant contribution\nof electron correlations to the binding energies of the\ninfinite chains is, in the present investigation, already\ngiven by pair interactions between the valence electrons\nof a monomer and its nearest and next-nearest neighbors. The K-body energy increments represent a general framework to describe van der Waals dispersion in-\n\n\f8\nteraction among the electrons from K one-body orbital\nsets. The decay of the two-body energy increments, i.e.,\nthe electron correlations between two monomers in the\nchains, with the intermonomer distance is investigated\nand van der Waals constants are determined, which affords a partition of the energy increments into a shortrange, van der Waals-reduced part and a long-range part\nthat can be summed analytically to infinite distances.\nThis partitioning affords a methodological advancement; if the van der Waals constants of a crystal are\navailable from other sources, then the number of energy\nincrements in the incremental expansion can be reduced\nby considering only van der Waals-reduced energy increments; they typically need to comprise only the nearestand next-nearest-neighbor energy increments. The small\nnumber of van der Waals-reduced energy increments permits one to significantly decrease the number of energy\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nCorresponding\nauthor.\nElectronic\naddress:\nChristian.Buth@web.de\nM.
