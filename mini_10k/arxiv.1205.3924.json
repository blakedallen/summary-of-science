In particular, B is locally isomorphic to the restriction to M+ of a\nlocal CFT net of factors on the two-dimensional Minkowski plane with chiral subnet A \u2297 A\n(the two-dimensional net on M , that is the product of the two chiral one-dimensional nets\non the light-rays that we assume to be coincide with A) and the restriction to A \u2297 A of the\nvacuum representation of B is to be induced by a representation of A, see Subsection 3.3.\nOne of the main results in [29] is that Haag dual BCFT nets are in one-to-one correspondence with non-local, but relatively local, irreducible, one-dimensional extensions of the\nlocal net A on the real boundary line. In particular, given such an extension B0 \u2283 A, the\ncorresponding BCFT net B0ind on M+ is given by\nB0ind (O) = B0 (K)\u2032 \u2229 B0 (L) ;\nhere O is the double cone O \u2261 I \u00d7 J of M+ (so I, J are intervals of the boundary real line\nwith disjoint closures and J > I), L is the smallest interval containing I and J and K is\nthe interval between I and J.\nDespite its simplicity and effectiveness, the above holographic correspondence has some\nlimitations. Firstly, only Haag dual BCFT nets appear and the non-dual ones are not\ndirectly visible, although present in the structure as intermediate subnets. Secondly, the\nlocal isomorphism of the BCFT net with a 2D CFT net on the full Minkowski plane can\nbe seen quite indirectly through the computation of combinatorial data. Because of this\nlast point, a more natural construction of the corresponding 2D net on the plane was later\nprovided by shifting directly the boundary at infinity [30].\nThe converse problem, how to consistently add a boundary condition in any 2D CFT\n(without affecting the algebraic structure away from the boundary) has however so far\nremained unsettled.\nThe purpose of this paper is indeed to provide a general algebraic procedure to this\nend. Given any 2D CFT net B2 on the Minkowski plane with chiral net A \u2297 A, where A\nis completely rational, we construct a BCFT local net B on the half-plane based on A and\nlocally isomorphic to B2 .\nOur procedure will generate all the BCFT local isomorphism class at one's hand. There\nare finitely many local, irreducible BCFT nets on M+ , locally isomorphic to B2 , and all\nof them appear as irreducible subrepresentations of a reducible net that we are going to\nconstruct.\nOur construction only depends on the restriction of B2 to M+ so, starting with a Boundary CFT net on M+ , it also give a procedure to produce all the BCFT nets that are locally\nisomorphic to B.\nThe reader willing to compare our Operator Algebraic construction to other works in\nmore traditional approaches to Boundary CFT in Physics, e.g. to the work of Cardy [7, 8], is\n2\n\n\freferred to the discussion in the paper [29], where he can find motivations and illustrations.\nWe say a couple of words here in the outlook.\nWe also mention that there are results, related to the ones in this paper, that were\npreviously obtained by Kong and Runkel within the context of modular tensor categories,\nsee [22].\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe shall denote by M the Minkowski plane,1 that is R2 with the Lorentz metric t2 \u2212 x2 . A\ndouble cone O in M is a rectangle in the chiral coordinates, namely a subset of the form\nO = {ht, xi : u \u2261 t + x \u2208 I, v \u2261 t \u2212 x \u2208 J} with I, J open, non-empty intervals of R and we\nset O \u2261 I \u00d7 J. We denote by K the set of double cones of M .\nIf E \u2282 M is an open region, K(E) denote the set of double cones contained in E with\npositive distance from the boundary of E. The half-plane x > 0 is denoted by M+ and in\nthis case we shall put K+ \u2261 K(M+ ).\nThe M\u00f6bius group G acts locally2 on R and globally on the one point compactification\nS 1 of R; the universal cover \u1e20 of G acts globally on the universal cover of S 1 . The product\naction on the chiral lines of M gives a local action of \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20 on M , and a global action of (a\nquotient of) \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20 on the Einstein universe (the cylinder). We shall be mainly concerned\nwith the local action of G on M obtained by restricting the local action of G \u00d7 G to the\ndiagonal, this action restricts to local actions of G on M+ and on its boundary, the time-axis\nof M .\nIf E is an open subset of M , the above local action of G on M clearly restricts to a local\naction of G on E.\nA net of von Neumann algebras B on E is an isotonous map\nB : O \u2208 K(E) 7\u2192 B(O)\nwhere the B(O)'s are von Neumann algebras on a fixed Hilbert space H = HB .\nB is local if B(O1 ) and B(O2 ) commute if O1 and O2 are spacelike separated. In this\npaper all nets will be local.\nClearly, if B is a net on E and E1 \u2282 E we may restrict B to a net on E1 .\nSuppose G is a Lie subgroup of \u1e20, containing the translation subgroup, thus acting\nlocally on E \u2282 M . The net B is G-covariant if there exists a unitary representation U of (a\ncovering of) G on HB such that\nU (g)B(O)U (g)\u2217 = B(gO)\nfor every O \u2208 K(E) with g, O path connected to the identity within E namely there exists a\npath of elements gs \u2208 G connecting the identity of G with g such that gs O \u2208 K(E).\nMoreover we assume the generator of the translation one-parameter subgroup to be\npositive and the existence of a unique (up to a phase) U -invariant unit vector \u03a9 \u2208 HB .\n1\nWe deal here with two-dimensional spacetimes, the reader may recognize how certain facts hold in more\ngenerality.\n2\nIf a Lie group G acts on the manifold P then, in particular, for every compact set K \u2282 P there is a\nneighborhood VK of the identity of G such that gK \u2282 P for all g \u2208 VK . For the notion of local action see\n[4].\n\n3\n\n\fA representation of the net B on a E is a map\nO \u2208 K(E) 7\u2192 \u03c0O\nwhere \u03c0O is a normal representation of B(O) on a fixed Hilbert space H\u03c0 such that\n\u03c0\u00d5 |B(O) = \u03c0O ,\n\nO \u2282 \u00d5 .\n\nThe representation \u03c0 of B on the Hilbert space H\u03c0 is covariant (with positive energy) if\nthere exists a unitary representation U\u03c0 on H\u03c0 of a covering group \u1e20 of G such that\n\u03c0gO (U (g)XU (g)\u2217 ) = U\u03c0 (g)\u03c0O (X)U\u03c0 (g)\u2217 ,\n\nX \u2208 B(O), O \u2208 K(E),\n\nwith g \u2208 \u1e20 and g, O path connected to the identity within E\nWe shall say that two nets B1 , B2 on E, acting on the Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 , are\nlocally isomorphic if for every O \u2208 K(E) there is an isomorphism \u03a6O : B1 (O) \u2192 B2 (O) such\nthat\n\u03a6\u00d5 |B1 (O) = \u03a6O\nif O and \u00d5 belong to K(E) with O \u2282 \u00d5; G-covariantly isomorphic if furthermore\nU2 (g)\u03a6O (X)U2 (g)\u2217 = \u03a6gO (U1 (g)XU1 (g)\u2217 ),\n\nX \u2208 B1 (O) ,\n\nwith U1 and U2 the corresponding unitary representation of G on H1 and H2 ; and (unitarily)\nequivalent if they are covariantly isomorphic and the isomorphism \u03a6O is implemented by a\nunitary H1 \u2192 H2 independent of O.\nLet B be a local net on E. We denote by C \u2217 (B) = C \u2217 (B, E) the (locally normal)\nuniversal C\u2217 -algebra of B, that can be defined similarly as in chiral CFT context [12, 14, 9]:\nC \u2217 (B) is the unique C\u2217 -algebra with embeddings \u03b9O : B(O) \u2192 C \u2217 (B), O \u2208 K(E), such\nthat \u03b9\u00d5 |BO) = \u03b9O if O \u2282 \u00d5, generated by {\u03b9O (B(O)) : O \u2208 K(E)}, with a one-to one\ncorrespondence between locally normal representations of \u03c0 of C \u2217 (B) and representations\n{\u03c0O }O\u2208K(E) of B on a Hilbert space H given by the commutative diagram\nC \u2217 (B)\nOO\n\n\u274d\u274d\n\u274d\u274d \u03c0\n\u274d\u274d\n\u03b9O\n\u274d\u274d\n\u274d$$\n\u03c0O\n// B(H)\nB(O)\n\nHere \u03c0 locally normal means that \u03c0 * \u03b9O is normal, O \u2208 K(E). Moreover C \u2217 (B) is minimal\nwith this universality property: if C \u2217 (B)\u223c is another C \u2217 -algebra with the same properties,\nthere exists a homomorphism C \u2217 (B)\u223c \u2192 C \u2217 (B) interchanging the embeddings of the B(O)'s.\nNote that locally isomorphic nets have canonically isomorphic universal C \u2217 -algebras.\nWe shall denote by B(E) the C \u2217 -algebra on the defining (vacuum) Hilbert space HB\ngenerated by the von Neumann algebras B(O) as O runs in K(E). By the universality\nproperty, B(E) is naturally a quotient of C \u2217 (B, E), indeed\n\u0001\n(1)\nB(E) = \u03c00 C \u2217 (B, E) ,\nwhere \u03c00 is the lift to C \u2217 (B, E) of the identity representation of B.\nIf F \u2282 E we have B(F ) \u2282 B(E). On the other hand, by the universally property, there\na homomorphism\nC \u2217 (B, F ) \u2192 C \u2217 (B, E) ,\ncf. the general covariance principle [3].\n4\n\n\fLemma 2.1. If K(E) is an inductive family and the B(O) are type III factors (on a\nseparable Hilbert space), then C \u2217 (B, E) is equal to B(E) and is a simple, purely infinite\nC \u2217 -algebra in Cuntz standard form (cf. [17, 9]).\nProof. B(E) is the C \u2217 inductive limit of the type III factors B(O). As the B(O)'s\nare simple C \u2217 -algebras, also B(E) is simple and it has the above universality property so\nC \u2217 (B) = B(E). As a type III factor is purely infinite in Cuntz standard form, so is B(E).\n\u0003\nThe following notion will be crucial in this paper.\nLet A \u2282 B unital C\u2217 -algebras. If B acts on a Hilbert space H, we shall say that \u03be \u2208 H is\na bicyclic vector for A \u2282 B if \u03be is cyclic for A, hence for B. If \u03c6 is a state on B, we shall\nsay that \u03c6 is a bicyclic state for A \u2282 B if the vector \u03be\u03c6 in the GNS representation \u03c0\u03c6 of B\nis bicyclic for \u03c0\u03c6 (A) \u2282 \u03c0\u03c6 (B).\nLemma 2.2. Let\n\nN \u2282 M\n\u222a\n\u222a\nN0 \u2282 M0\n\nbe a square of inclusions of infinite factors and \u03b5 : M \u2192 M0 a normal faithful conditional\nexpectation with \u03b5(N ) = N0 . Suppose that N0 \u2282 N and M0 \u2282 M are irreducible inclusions\nwith the same finite index: [M : M0 ] = [N : N0 ].\nIf \u03c60 is normal state on M0 which is bicyclic for N0 \u2282 M0 , then the state \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c60 * \u03b5 on\nM is bicyclic for N \u2282 M .\nProof. We can assume we are in the Hilbert space H of the GNS representation of \u03c6 with\ncyclic vector \u03be. By assumption H0 \u2261 N0 \u03be = M0 \u03be.\nNow, following the argument in [14, Prop. 2.3], there is an isometry T \u2208 N such that\nN = N0 T and M = M0 T , cf. [26, 27]. Therefore H = M \u03be = T \u2217 M0 \u03be = T \u2217 H0 = T \u2217 N0 \u03be,\nnamely \u03c6 is bicyclic for N \u2282 M .\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nNets on M+ and on a wedge\n\nWe now discuss more explicitly the nets of von Neumann algebras on the half-plane M+ , on\na wedge region W , and their relations.\n\n3.1\n\nNets on M+\n\nLet I1 , I2 be intervals of time-axis and O = I1 \u00d7 I2 be the double cone of M associated with\nI1 , I2 . Then O \u2282 M+ iff I2 > I1 and in this case O \u2208 K+ iff the closures of I1 and I2 have\nempty intersection.\nLet G be a Lie subgroup of G with the inherited local action on M , hence on M+ ,\nby the diagonal action as above. We will always assume that G contains the translation\none-parameter subgroup.\nA (local, G-covariant) QFT net B of von Neumann algebras on M+ on a Hilbert space\nH = HB is a triple (B, U, \u03a9) where\n5\n\n\f\u2022 B is a isotonous map\nO \u2208 K+ 7\u2192 B(O) \u2282 B(H)\nwhere B(O) is a von Neumann algebra on H;\n\u2022 U is a unitary representation of G on H, with positive generator for translation oneparameter subgroup, such that\nU (g)B(O)U (g)\u2217 = B(gO),\n\nO \u2208 K+ ,\n\nfor all g \u2208 G such that g, O is path connected to the identity within M+ (in particular\nfor all g in the translation subgroup).\n\u2022 \u03a9 \u2208 H is a unit vector such that C\u03a9 are the U -invariant vectors and \u03a9 is cyclic for\nB(O) for each fixed O \u2208 K+ .\n\u2022 B(O1 ) and B(O2 ) commute if O1 , O2 \u2208 K+ are spacelike separated.\nWe shall shortly indicate the triple (B, U, \u03a9) by B.\nProposition 3.1. Let B be a local, G-covariant net as above. Then \u03a9 is separating for\nevery B(O), O \u2208 K+ , and B is irreducible, namely B(M+ ) is irreducible.\nProof. If O \u2208 K+ there is O1 \u2208 K+ space like to O. By locality B(O1 ) \u2282 B(O)\u2032 , so \u03a9 is\ncyclic for B(O)\u2032 , thus separating for B(O).\nConcerning the irreducibility, since the one-parameter translation group of unitaries\nU (t) has positive generator, U (t)\u03a9 = \u03a9 and U (t)B(M+ )U (t)\u2217 = B(M+ ), we have U (t) \u2208\nB(M+ )\u2032\u2032 by a theorem by Borchers as \u03a9 is cyclic, see [24]. So the one-dimensional projection\nonto C\u03a9 belongs to B(M+ )\u2032\u2032 and this implies B(M+ )\u2032\u2032 = B(H), see [24].\n\u0003\nA representation of the QFT net B of von Neumann algebras on M+ on a Hilbert space H\nis a map\n\u03c0 : O \u2208 K+ 7\u2192 \u03c0O\n(2)\nwhere \u03c0O is a normal representation of B(O) on H and \u03c0\u00d5 |O = \u03c0O if O \u2282 \u00d5.\n\u03c0 is covariant (with positive energy) if there exists a unitary representation U\u03c0 of G on\nH (with translation positive generator) s.t.\n\u0001\nU\u03c0 (g)\u03c0O (X)U\u03c0 (g)\u2217 = \u03c0gO U (g)XU (g)\u2217\n(3)\nif X \u2208 B(O) with g \u2208 G, O \u2208 K+ and g, O is path connected to the identity within M+ .\n\n3.2\n\nNets on the wedge W\n\nWe shall always denote by W the right wedge {ht, xi : x > |t|}. Thus W \u2282 M+ .\nIf B is a G-covariant QFT net of von Neumann algebras on M+ , clearly B restricts to a\nG-covariant QFT net of von Neumann algebras on W , which is G-covariant w.r.t. the local\naction of G on W . Conversely:\nLemma 3.2. Let BW a local, G-covariant QFT net of von Neumann algebras on W on\na Hilbert space H. There exists a unique local, G-covariant QFT net B of von Neumann\nalgebras on M+ on H whose restriction to W is BW .\n6\n\n\fProof. With U the unitary representation of (a covering of) G associated with BW , we set\nB(gO) \u2261 U (g)BW (O)U (g)\u2217 ,\n\nO \u2208 K(W ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith g, O path connected to the identity within M+ . Note that all double cones in K+ have\nthis form, indeed every O \u2208 K+ is a translated of a double cone in K(W ).\nIt is enough to check that (4) well defines B, as then the net properties of B are then\nimmediate. So let O1 \u2208 K+ and g1 \u2208 G, with g1 , O1 be path connected to the identity\nwithin M+ and satisfy U (g1 )BW (O1 )U (g1 )\u2217 = U (g)BW (O)U (g)\u2217 . Then\nU (h)BW (O)U (h)\u2217 = BW (O1 ),\n\nh \u2261 g1\u22121 g .\n\nWe show now that h is unique. Indeed, as an element of \u1e20, the equation hO = O1 determines\nh uniquely up to a M\u00f6bius 2\u03c0-rotation (on the boundary line an element of G is determined\nby its action on four different points). But then h is unique by the path connectedness\nproperty. So gO = g1 O1 .\nThe locality of B follows because, if O1 , O2 a pair of spacelike separated double cones\nin K+ , there is a pair O1W , O2W of spacelike separated double cones in K(W ) and a timetranslation mapping O1W , O2W onto O1 , O2 .\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.3. Let B a local, G-covariant QFT net of von Neumann algebras on M+\nand BW its restriction to W .\nEvery (covariant) representation of B restricts to a (covariant) representation of BW .\nConversely, every covariant representation of BW extends uniquely to a covariant representation of B.\nProof. The first statement is obvious.\nAs for the second statement, let U be the covariant unitary representation of G. Let \u03c0\nbe a covariant representation of BW . We set\n\u0001\n(5)\n\u03c0\u0303gO U (g)XU (g)\u2217 \u2261 U\u03c0 (g)\u03c0O (X)U\u03c0 (g)\u2217 , X \u2208 BW (O), O \u2208 KW ,\nwhere g, O is path connected to the identity within M+ and U\u03c0 is the covariant unitary\nrepresentation of G in the representation \u03c0.\nBy the argument in Lemma 3.2, \u03c0\u0303gO is well defined. It is immediate to check that\n\u03c0\u0303 : O \u2208 K+ 7\u2192 \u03c0\u0303O is a covariant representation of B extending \u03c0.\n\u0003\nLet B a G-covariant net on W as above and B(W ) the the associated C \u2217 -algebra (isomorphic\nto C \u2217 (BW )). If g \u2208 G, O \u2208 K(W ) with g, O path connected to the identity within W , we\ndenote by \u03b1O\ng the isomorphism of B(O) onto B(gO) given by\n\u2217\n\u03b1O\ng (X) = U (g)XU (g) ,\n\nX \u2208 B(O) .\n\nA state \u03c6 of B(W ) is \u03b1-invariant if\n\u03c6(\u03b1O\ng (X)) = \u03c6(X),\n\nX \u2208 B(O),\n\nfor all g \u2208 G and O \u2208 K(W ) with g, O path connected to the identity within W .\n7\n\n(6)\n\n\fLemma 3.4. Let \u03c6 be an \u03b1-invariant state of B as above and suppose \u03c6 to be bicyclic for\nB(O) \u2282 B(\u00d5) if O \u2282 \u00d5 \u2208 K(W ). Then the GNS representation \u03c0\u03c6 of B is covariant,\nindeed there exists a unique unitary representation U\u03c6 of (a cover of ) G implementing the\ncovariance of \u03c0\u03c6 as in eq. (3) and U\u03c6 (g)\u03be\u03c6 = \u03be\u03c6 .\nProof. Note that \u03be\u03c6 is cyclic for \u03c0\u03c6 (B(O) for every O \u2208 K(W ). Indeed we can find an\nincreasing sequence of double cones On \u2208 K(W ) containing O such that \u222an On = W . Then\n[\n\u03c0\u03c6 (B(Ok ))\u03be\u03c6 = \u03c0\u03c6 (B(W ))\u03be\u03c6 = H\u03c6 .\n\u03c0\u03c6 (B(O))\u03be\u03c6 = \u03c0\u03c6 (B(On ))\u03be\u03c6 =\nk\n\nLet O \u2208 K(W ) and VO a connected neighborhood of the identity of G such that gO \u2208 K(W )\nfor all g \u2208 VO .

See\n[24] for more details. We denote by G the M\u00f6bis group, that naturally acts on S 1 .\n3.3.1\n\nM\u00f6bius covariant nets\n\nA local, M\u00f6bius covariant net of von Neumann algebras A on S 1 is a map A : I \u2192 A(I)\nfrom I, the set of (open, proper) intervals of S 1 , to the set of von Neumann algebras on a\nHilbert space H that verifies the following properties:\nIsotony: If I1 , I2 belong to I and I1 \u2282 I2 , then A(I1 ) \u2282 A(I2 ) .\nM\u00f6bius covariance: There is a strongly continuous unitary representation U of G on H\nsuch that U (g)A(I)U (g)\u2217 = A(gI), g \u2208 G, I \u2208 I.\nPositivity of the energy: U is a positive energy representation.\nExistence and uniqueness of the vacuum: There exists a unique (up to a phase) unit U invariant vector \u03a9 (vacuum) and \u03a9 is cyclic for the von Neumann algebra \u2228I\u2208I A(I)\nLocality: If I1 and I2 are disjoint intervals, the von Neumann algebras A(I1 ) and A(I2 )\ncommute: A(I1 ) \u2282 A(I2 )\u2032\nThe uniqueness (up\u0001to a phase) of the vacuum vector \u03a9 is equivalent to the irreducibility\n\u2032\u2032\nof A (i.e. \u222aI A(I) = B(H)) and to the factoriality of the local von Neumann algebras\nA(I), see [4, 24].\nA local M\u00f6bius covariant net on R is the restriction of a local M\u00f6bius covariant net on S 1\nto R = S 1 r {\u22121} (identification by the stereographic map).\nConcerning completely rational nets, we refer the reader to [20].\n8\n\n\f3.4\n\nInducing representations\n\nLet then A be a local M\u00f6bius covariant net of von Neumann algebras on R, that we shall\nalways assume to be completely rational, on a Hilbert space H = HA . If L \u2282 R is an open,\nnon-empty subset, we shall denote by A(L) the C \u2217 -algebra generated by A(I) as I runs in\nthe intervals contained in L.\nBy a locally normal representation \u03c0 of A(R) on a Hilbert space H\u03c0 we shall mean a\nrepresentation \u03c0 of A(R) on H\u03c0 such that \u03c0|A(I) is normal for all intervals I of R. (If H\u03c0 is\nseparable, every representation of A(R) is locally normal.)\nBy a representation (or DHR representation) \u03c0 of A(R) we shall mean as usual a\nconsistent family of normal representations \u03c0I of A(I) on H\u03c0 associated to intervals of\nS 1 = R \u222a {\u221e}.\nThere is a natural correspondence between a representation \u03c0 of A and a representation\nof \u03c0 of A(R) such that \u03c0|A(RrI) is normal for every open non-empty interval I of R, see [20,\nAppendix].\nStarting with the local, M\u00f6bius covariant net A on H, we have a local G covariant net\nA+ on M+ defined by\nA+ (O) \u2261 A(I) \u2228 A(J),\n\nO = I \u00d7 J \u2208 K+ .\n\n(7)\n\nNote that by the split property A+ (O) is naturally isomorphic to A(I) \u2297 A(J), and we have\na left identification of A(I) with the subalgebra A(I) \u2297 C of A(O) and a right identification\nof A(J) with the subalgebra C \u2297 A(J) of A(O).\nThe unitary representation U of the M\u00f6bius group G giving the covariance for A also\ngives the G-covariance for A+ :\nU (g)A+ (O)U (g)\u2217 = A+ (gO)\nwhere O = I \u00d7 J and gO \u2261 gI \u00d7 gJ.\nNote that the vacuum vector \u03a9 is bicyclic for A(I) \u2282 A+ (O) and for A(J) \u2282 A+ (O)\nwith the left and right identification.\nWe explicitly recall the following basic fact.\nProposition 3.5. The net A+ is covariantly locally isomorphic to (A \u2297 A)|M+ , the restriction to M+ of the 2D net A \u2297 A on M with covariance unitary representation U \u2297 U\n(diagonal action of G \u2282 G \u00d7 G). A+ and (A \u2297 A)|M+ are not unitarily equivalent.\nProof. The local isomorphism follows by the split property of A, see [11]. That A+ and\n(A\u2297A)|M+ are not equivalent follows, for example, from the fact that the split property fails\nfor contiguous intervals so the von Neumann algebra associated with O = (\u22121, 0) \u00d7 (0, 1)\nby the net A+ is not naturally isomorphic with A(\u22121, 0) \u2297 A(0, 1).\n\u0003\nTherefore A+ and (A \u2297 A)|M+ share the same representations, indeed one could consider\none a representation of the other.\nIf \u03c0 is a locally normal representation of A(R) on a Hilbert space H\u03c0 , there is an induced\nrepresentation \u03c0+ of A+ on H\u03c0 given by\n\u03c0+O (XY ) \u2261 \u03c0(XY ),\n\nX \u2208 A(I), Y \u2208 A(J),\n9\n\nO = I \u00d7 J \u2208 K+ .\n\n\fClearly \u03c0+ is G-covariant with positive energy if so is \u03c0. Namely there is a unitary representation U\u03c0 of G with positive energy such that\nU\u03c0 (g)\u03c0O (X)U\u03c0 (g)\u2217 = \u03c0+ gO (U (g)XU (g)\u2217 ),\n\nX \u2208 A+ (O) ,\n\nwith U the unitary covariance representation of G.\nNote that this is always the case if \u03c0 is a (DHR) representation of A, because every\nrepresentation of a completely rational net is G-covariant with positive energy.\nIf \u03c00 is the vacuum (i.e. identity) representation of A, we call \u03c00+ the vacuum representation of A+ .\nLemma 3.6. Let \u03c0 be a representation of A+ on a Hilbert space H. The following are\nequivalent:\n(i): \u03c0 is G-covariant with positive energy and there is a U\u03c0 -invariant unit vector \u03a9 \u2208 H\nwhich is bicyclic for \u03c0O (A(I)) \u2282 \u03c0O (A+ (O)) and for \u03c0O (A(J)) \u2282 \u03c0O (A+ (O)), O \u2261 I \u00d7 J,\nwith the left and right identification.\n(ii): \u03c0 is unitarily equivalent to the vacuum representation \u03c00+ .\nProof. (ii) \u21d2 (i) is immediate by the Reeh-Schlieder property of the vacuum vector for\nA, see [24] or [4].\n(i) \u21d2 (ii): With I an interval of R, set C(I) \u2261 A\u03c0 (WI ) where WI \u2261 {ht, xi : t \u00b1 x \u2208\nI, x > 0} is the left wedge of M+ spanned by I and A\u03c0 (WI ) is the von Neumann algebra\ngenerated by \u03c0O (A+ (O)) as O \u2208 K+ runs within WI . Note that C is a net, \u03a9 is cyclic\nfor each C(I) because A\u03c0 (WI ) \u2283 \u03c0O (A+ (O)) if O \u2282 WI , separating for each C(I) because\nA\u03c0 (WI ) commutes with \u03c0O (A+ (O)) if O \u2282 WI\u2032 , and U\u03c0 implements the G-covariance for\nC. Therefore C is a M\u00f6bius covariant net on R (we shall soon show that C is local and\nirreducible), in its vacuum representation.\nNow we set\n\\\n\u03c0O (A(O)), O = I \u00d7 J,\n\u03c0(A(I)) \u2261\nJ\n\n(intersection over all intervals of R). By the split property \u03c0(A(I)) is naturally isomorphic\nto A(I).\nNowt \u03c0(A(I)) \u2282 C(I) for every open interval I; in fact if I0 \u22d0 I is an open interval with\nI0 \u2282 I, then \u03c0(A(I0 )) \u2282 C(I) with the left identification because I0 \u00d7 J\u03b5 \u2282 WI for a suitable\nsmall interval J\u03b5 .\nNow the map I 7\u2192 \u03c0(A(I)) is a M\u00f6bius covariant net on H in the vacuum representation,\nas \u03a9 is cyclic for it by the bicyclicity assumption. Moreover \u03c0(A(I)) is local because if I1 , I2\nare disjoint intervals there is an interval I \u2283 I1 , I2 and \u03c0(A(I1 )) and \u03c0(A(I2 )) are commuting\nsubalgebras of \u03c0(A(I)).\nSo, by the bicyclicity property of \u03a9, we have \u03c0(A(I)) = C(I) with the left (and analogously with the right) identification; this follows by the Bisognano-Wichmann property for\nA, see [4], and the Tomita-Takesaki theory (C(I)\u2032 is a cyclic von Neumann subalgebra of\n\u03c0(A(I))\u2032 globaly invariant under the modular group action).\nThen the net C+ is given by\nC+ (O) = C(I) \u2228 C(J) = \u03c0(A(I)) \u2228 \u03c0(A(J)) = \u03c0O (A(O)),\n\nO = I \u00d7 J,\n\nnamely \u03c0 = \u03c00+ where \u03c00 is the vacuum representation of C; as C is naturally isomorphic\nto A, the proof is completed.\n\u0003\n10\n\n\fIf E \u2282 M+ , we denote by A+ (E) the C \u2217 -algebra on HA associated with E by A+ as in (1).\nLemma 3.7. We have:\n(a): If W1 = (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b41 ) \u00d7 (\u03b42 \u00d7 \u221e) is a wedge contained in W , \u03b41 , \u03b42 \u2265 0, then A+ (W1 )\nis the C \u2217 -algebra generated by A(\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b41 ) and A(\u03b42 \u00d7 \u221e).\n(b): A+ (W1 ) is a simple C \u2217 -algebra.\n(c): If \u03c0 is a locally normal representation of A(R) then \u03c0+ (A+ (W ))\u2032\u2032 = \u03c0(A(R))\u2032\u2032 .\nProof. (a) is immediate by the definition of A+ .\n(b) holds true as A+ (W1 ) is the inductive limit of the A+ (O)'s, O \u2208 K(W1 ) and the each\nA(O) is simple because it is a type III factor.\n(c) We have A+ (W ) = A(R r {0}) so \u03c0+ (A+ (W ))\u2032\u2032 = \u03c0(A(R r {0}))\u2032\u2032 \u2282 A(R)\u2032\u2032 . So we\nhave to show that \u03c0(A(R r {0}))\u2032\u2032 = A(R)\u2032\u2032 , namely that \u03c0(A(R r {0}))\u2032\u2032 \u2283 \u03c0(A(I)) if I is\nan interval of R and 0 \u2208 I. But this is true because by strong additivity A(I r {0})\u2032\u2032 = A(I),\nso \u03c0(A(I r {0}))\u2032\u2032 = \u03c0(A(I)) by the local normality of \u03c0.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.8. Let \u03c3 be a representation of A+ on a Hilbert space H. Suppose there is\na unit vector \u03a9 \u2208 H such that the state \u03c9 \u2261 (\u03a9, * \u03a9) is bicyclic for \u03c3O (A(I)) \u2282 \u03c3O (A+ (O))\nand for \u03c3O (A(J)) \u2282 \u03c3O (A+ (O)), for every double cone O = I \u00d7 J, with the left and right\nidentification, and that \u03c9 is bicyclic for \u03c3\u00d5 (A(O)) \u2282 \u03c3\u00d5 (A(\u00d5)) too, if O \u2282 \u00d5 belong to\nK(W ).\nLet H0 be the Hilbert subspace \u03c3O (A+ (O))\u03a9 of H (independent of O), \u03c30 the restriction\nof \u03c3 to H0 and assume that \u03c30 is G-covariant with positive energy and \u03a9 a is a fixed\nU\u03c30 -vector.\nIf \u03a9 is separating for \u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 , for any wedge W1 \u2282 W with positive distance to the\nboundary of W , then \u03c3 is equivalent to \u03c0+ with \u03c0 a (DHR) representation of A.\nProof. By Lemma 3.6, the restriction \u03c30 of \u03c3 to H0 is equivalent to \u03c00+ where \u03c00 is the\nvacuum representation of A.\nThe restriction map rO : \u03c3O (X) 7\u2192 \u03c30O (X) \u2261 \u03c3O (X)|H0 , X \u2208 A+ (O), is normal and\none-to-one because \u03a9 is separating for \u03c3(A+ (O)) and we have\n\u22121\n\u22121\n* \u03c00+ O = \u03c0+ O ,\n* \u03c30O = rO\n\u03c3 O = rO\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the locally normal representation of A(R) determined by \u03c0(X)|H0 = \u03c00 (X),\nX \u2208 A(R).\nWe want to show that \u03c0 is a DHR representation of A.\nThe restriction map \u03c3(X) 7\u2192 \u03c30 (X) \u2261 \u03c3(X)|H0 , X \u2208 A+ (W1 ), extends to a normal\nmap rW1 : \u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03c30 (A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 which is invertible because \u03a9 is separating for\n\u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 .

(8), \u03c0 is normal on A(I1 \u222a J1 ), hence \u03c0 is a DHR representation, see\nthe appendix of [20].\n\u0003\n\n11\n\n\f4\n\nBoundary CFT nets and their characterization\n\nA Boundary CFT net of von Neumann algerbras on M+ was defined in [30], here we give\nan equivalent, slightly different, definition (see Remark 4.1).\nLet A be a M\u00f6bius covariant local net of factors on R.\nA local Boundary CFT (BCFT) net B associated with A is a local, isotonous map\nB : O \u2208 K+ 7\u2192 B(O),\nwhere the B(O) are von Neumann algebras on a Hilbert space HB , such that\n(a) there is a unitary representation U of the covering of the M\u00f6bius group \u1e20 with\npositive generator for the subgroup of translations, such that\nU (g)B(O)U (g)\u2217 = B(gO)\n\n(9)\n\nwhenever g \u2208 \u1e20 takes the double cone O = I \u00d7 J \u2208 K+ into another double-cone gO \u2261\ngI \u00d7 gJ within M+ , with an invariant vector unit \u03a9 \u2208 HB (the vacuum vector).\n(b) There is a representation \u03c0 of A on HB such that B+ (O) contains \u03c0+ (A+ (O)) with\n\u03c0+ (A+ (O))\u2032 \u2229 B(O) = C and\nU (g)\u03c0+ (A+ (O))U (g)\u2217 = \u03c0+ (A+ (gO))\n\n(10)\n\nwhenever O and gO belong to K+ .\n(c) The vector \u03a9 is cyclic and separating for each B(O), O \u2208 K+ .\nWe shall say that B is irreducible if the C \u2217 -algebra B(M+ ) is irreducible.\nRemark 4.1. In [30] a local, irreducible BCFT net B associated as above but the irreducibility\nof the inclusion \u03c0+ (A+ (O))\u2032 \u2229 B(O) = C is not assumed there, moreover \u03a9 is only assumed\nto be cyclic or separating although it has to be cyclic for B(M+ ) which is irreducible. On\nthe other hand joint irreducibility is assumed there:\n\u03c0+ (C \u2217 (A+ ))\u2032\u2032 \u2228 B(O) = B(H)\nfor any double cone O \u2208 K+ .\nAs shown in [30], the definition of a BCFT net implies the above properties (a), (b), (c).\nOn the other hand, if we assume the above properties (a), (b), (c) and that U (g) \u2208\n\u03c0+ (C \u2217 (A+ ))\u2032\u2032 , g \u2208 \u1e20, then B is a BCFT net in the sense of [30].\nWhile we shall deal here with the above definition, we shall obtain the property that\nU (g) \u2208 \u03c0+ (C \u2217 (A+ ))\u2032\u2032 in Corollary 5.6, so our constructed nets will be BCFT nets in the\nsense of [30].\nWe now give an equivalent formulation for a boundary CFT net.\nProposition 4.2. Let B a (local) BQFT net on M+ that we assume to be \u1e20-covariant with\npositive energy. We assume that B contains A+ as an irreducible subnet, where A+ is the\nnet on M+ associated to a chiral local M\u00f6bius covariant net A as above (7). Suppose the\nvacuum vector \u03a9 of B gives a bicyclic state for A(I) \u2282 A+ (O) and A(J) \u2282 A+ (O) with the\nleft and right embedding, O = I \u00d7 J.\nThen B is a Boundary CFT net on M+ associated with A.\n12\n\n\fProof. By assumption there is a representation \u03c3 of A+ such that \u03c3(A+ (O)) is an irreducible subfactor of B+ (O) and the covariance of \u03c3 is obtained from the covariance of B+\nand we need to show that there is a representation \u03c0 of A such that \u03c0+ = \u03c3.\nWe then obtain the conclusion by Lemma 3.6 once we know that the vacuum vector \u03a9\nis separating for \u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 if W1 is a right translated of the wedge W . Now \u03a9 is cyclic\nfor B(O) if O \u2208 K+ , O \u2282 W1\u2032 , hence for B+ (W1\u2032 ), therefore by locality \u03a9 is separating for\nB(W1 ). Since \u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 is contained in B(W1 ), \u03a9 is separating for \u03c3(A+ (W1 ))\u2032\u2032 as well.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.3. Let B a local, Boundary CFT net on M+ associated with A as above\nwith A completely rational. For each O \u2208 K+ there exists a unique conditional expectation\n\u03b5O : B(O) \u2192 \u03c0+ (A+ (O)) and the family is consistent: \u03b5\u00d5 |B(O) = \u03b5O if O \u2282 \u00d5 belong to\nK+ .\nProof. Let O \u2208 K+ . Then \u03c0+ (A+ (O)) \u2282 B(O) is irreducible with finite index [29] so there\nexists a unique conditional expectation \u03b5O : B(O) \u2192 \u03c0+ (A+ (O)). To check the consistency,\nit is enough to assume that \u00d5 \u2283 O has one corner in common with O (by iterating the\nargument). So \u00d5 = I \u0303\u00d7 J \u0303 and O = I \u00d7 J and I1 \u2261 I \u0303r I, J1 \u2261 J \u0303r J are (not open) intervals,\nso O\u2032 \u2229 \u00d5 = O1 where O1 \u2261 I1 \u00d7 J1 \u2208 K+ .

We assume that B2 is irreducible (or, equivalently,\nthat, \u03a9 is the unique U -invariant vector up to a phase), so the local von Neumann algebras\nB2 (O), O \u2208 K, are factors. Then B2 is an irreducible extension of the CFT subnet A2 ,\nthe tensor product of the chiral subnets that we assume to be equal (parity symmetry), so\nA2 \u2243 A \u2297 A, namely A2 (O) = A(I) \u2297 A(J) with I \u00d7 J = O \u2208 K where A is a local M\u00f6bius\n13\n\n\fcovariant net on R. More precisely, there exists a representation \u03c02 of A2 on HB2 such\nthat \u03c02 (A2 (O)) \u2282 B2 (O) is an irreducible inclusion of factors and U (g)\u03c02 (A2 (O))U (g)\u2217 =\n\u03c02 (A2 (gO)), O \u2208 K. 3\nA we are assuming A to be completely rational, also B2 is completely rational and\n\u03c02 (A2 (O)) \u2282 B2 (O) has finite index [20, 19].\nWe want to construct a BCFT net B on M+ based on A in the sense of [30], as specified\nin Sect. 4, and isomorphic to the restriction of B2 to M+ . Namely we want to construct a\nnet B on M+ , a representation \u03c0 of A on HB and a local isomorphism \u03a6 of B with B2 |M+\nsuch that \u03a6O : \u03c0+ (A+ (O)) \u2192 \u03c02 (A2 (O)), O \u2208 K(M+ ). Moreover \u03a6 is to be covariant with\nrespect to covariance unitary representation of \u1e20 associated with B and the restriction to\n\u1e20 of the covariance unitary representation of \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20 associated with B (where \u1e20 is the\ndiagonal subgroup of \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20).\nAs K+ is not a direct family, our procedure will go through the restriction of B2 to the\nwedge W . So, denote by B2 (W ) the C \u2217 -algebra generated by B2 (O) as O runs in K(W ). As\nK(W ) is a direct family, B2 (W ) is the induct limit of the B2 (O)'s and C \u2217 (B2 , W ) = B(W ).\nAnalogously, A+ (W ) is the C \u2217 -algebra generated by A2 (O) as O runs in K(W ).\nClearly \u03c02 (A+ (W )) \u2282 B2 (W ) and there is a conditional expectation \u03b5 : B2 (W ) \u2192\n\u03c02 (A+ (W )) extending the unique finite index expectation \u03b5O : B2 (O) \u2192 \u03c02 (A+ (O)) for\neach O \u2208 K(W ). By continuity, \u03b5 satisfies the Pimsner-Popa bound\n\u03b5(X) \u2265 \u03bbX\nfor every positive element X \u2208 B2 (W ), where \u03bb > 0 is the inverse of the Jones index.\nNow consider the BCFT net A+ on M+ associated with A acting on HA in Sect. 3.3:\nA+ (O) \u2261 A(I) \u2228 A(J) ,\nwhere O = I \u00d7 J \u2208 K+ .\nTheorem 5.1. With B2 a local, M\u00f6bius covariant net on M as above, there exists a\nBoundary CFT net B on M+ based on A such that B is G-covariantly locally isomorphic to the restriction B2 |M+ of B2 to M+ as explained above. In particular the inclusions\n\u03c0+ (A+ (O)) \u2282 B(O) and \u03c02 (A2 (O)) \u2282 B2 (O) are isomorphic, O \u2208 K+ .\nThis theorem will be a consequence of Thm. 5.7 that we are going to prove.\nLet \u03a9 be the vacuum vector in the Hilbert space of HA and \u03c60 the associated vacuum state\non A+ (W ) implemented by \u03a9:\n\u03c60 (XY ) = (\u03a9, XY \u03a9),\n\nX \u2208 A(I), Y \u2208 A(J),\n\nO = I \u00d7 J \u2208 K(W ).\n\nWe now extend \u03c60 to a state \u03c6 on B2 (W ) by composing it with the conditional expectation\n\u03b5:\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c60 * \u03b5 .\nAs A+ (W ) is a simple C \u2217 -algebra by Lemma 2.1, \u03c02 is one-to-one on A+ (W ); to simplify\nthe notations we are identifying A+ (W ) with \u03c02 (A+ (W )) here and in the following.\n3\nA2 is a canonical subnet of B2 and its irreducibility follows by diffeomorphism covariance [19]. In this\npaper only M\u00f6bius covariance is assumed, so \u03c02 (A2 (O))\u2032 \u2229 B2 (O) = C is indeed an assumption.\n\n14\n\n\fLemma 5.2. The GNS representation \u03c0\u03c6 of \u03c6 decomposes into finitely many irreducible\nrepresentations of B2 (W ). Indeed \u03c0\u03c6 |A+ (W ) decomposes into finitely many irreducible representations of A+ (W ).\nProof. By Lemma 2.1, A+ (W ) and B(W ) are simple, purely infinite C \u2217 -algebras in Cuntz\nstandar form. So the lemma follows by a result by Izumi [17, Lemma 5.2] because \u03b5 has\nfinite index and \u03c60 is a pure state by Lemma 3.7.\n\u0003\nDenote by BW the restriction of B2 to W .\nLemma 5.3. \u03c0\u03c6 gives a covariant (reducible) representation of BW , hence a covariant\nrepresentation \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 of B2 |M+ (by Prop. 3.3).\nProof. By Lemma 3.4, the covariance of \u03c0\u03c6 will follow once we check that \u03c6 is \u03b1-invariant\nand bicyclic for B(O) \u2282 B(\u00d5) if O \u2282 \u00d5 \u2208 K(W ). Here \u03b1 is the local action on B2 (W ) given\nby the covariance unitary representation of \u1e20 for B2 as in eq. (6) (\u1e20 the diagonal subgroup\nof \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20).\nNow \u03c60 is \u03b1-invariant and bicyclic for A+ (O) \u2282 A+ (\u00d5), indeed in the GNS representation of \u03c60 the vector \u03be\u03c60 is the vacuum vector for A which is invariant with the Reeh-Schlieder\nproperty.\nNow the conditional expectation \u03b5 restricts to the unique expectation \u03b5O : B2 (O) \u2192\nO O\n\u03c02 (A+ (O)), so \u03b5gO * \u03b1O\ng = \u03b1g \u03b5 , namely \u03b5 is \u03b1-invariant, therefore \u03c6 is \u03b1-invariant. As the\nindex of \u03c02 (A+ (O)) \u2282 B2 (O) is independent of O, \u03c6 is then bicyclic for B2 (O) \u2282 B2 (\u00d5) by\nLemma 2.2.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.4. The restriction of \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 to A+ is equivalent to \u03c3+ where \u03c3 is a DHR representation of A.\nProof. Clearly the restriction of \u03c0\u03c6 to A+ (W ) contains \u03c0\u03c60 and \u03c0\u03c60 gives, by covariance,\nthe representation \u03c0+ of A+ , where \u03c0 is the vacuum representation of A. So \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 restricts to\n\u03c0+ on A+ .\nThus we can apply Prop. 3.8 with \u03a9 \u2261 \u03be\u03c6 \u2208 HB2 , indeed \u03be\u03c6 implements \u03c60 on A+ , so\nit has the needed bicyclicity properties. The only point to check is that \u03be\u03c6 is separating for\nW1 ; but this is true by Prop. 3.1.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.5. Let \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 be representation \u0010of the net B2 |M+ on M+\u0011 obtained by Lemma 5.3.\n\u0001\u2032\u2032\nS\n.\nThen \u03c0\u03c6 (B2 (W ))\u2032\u2032 = \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 (C \u2217 (B2 , M+ ))\u2032\u2032 =\nO\u2208K+ \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 (B2 (O)\nProof. By Lemma 5.2 the restriction of \u03c0\u03c6 to A+ (W ) is the direct sum of finitely many\nirreducible representations, so \u03c0\u03c6 (A+ (W ))\u2032 is finite dimensional.\nLet U be the unitary representation of \u1e20 implementing the covariance of \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 on H\u03c6 .\nThen U implements the covariance of the representation \u03c3 of A on H\u03c6 , given by Lemma\n5.4, such that \u03c3+ = \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 .\nNow, by Lemma 3.7, \u03c3 is the direct sum of finitely many irreducible representations of A,\nso \u03c3 is covariant with positive energy, moreover there exists a unique unitary representation\n15\n\n\fV of G implementing the covariance of \u03c3 (because V (g) \u2208 \u03c3(A)\u2032\u2032 ), therefore U = V has\npositive energy and belongs to \u03c3+ (A+ (M+ ))\u2032\u2032 , see [15, Prop. 2.2.].\nIf X belongs to B2 (W )\u2032 , then X \u2208 \u03c3+ (A+ (W ))\u2032 = \u03c3(A)\u2032 , hence X commutes with U .\nSo X commutes with U (g)B2 (W )U (g)\u2217 , g \u2208 \u1e20, hence with B2 (M+ ) as desired.\n\u0003\nDuring the proof of Lemma 5.5 we have proved the following.\nCorollary 5.6. Let U be the unitary representation of \u1e20 implementing the covariance of\n\u03c0\u0303\u03c6 on H\u03c6 , and \u03c3 the representation of A on H\u03c6 given by Lemma 5.4. Then U has positive\nenergy and U (g) \u2208 \u03c3+ (A(W ))\u2032\u2032 .\nTheorem 5.7. \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 is the direct sum of finitely many irreducible representations of B2 |M+ .\nEach irreducible component of \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 is covariant and defines an irreducible, local Boundary\nCFT net on M+ .\nProof. The first statement is immediate from Lemmas 5.2 and 5.5.\n\u03c0\u0303\u03c6 is covariant, see Lemma 5.3, and let U be the covariance unitary representation\nof G; as the center of \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 (C \u2217 (B))\u2032\u2032 is finite-dimensional and globally AdU -invariant, it is\nindeed AdU pointwise fixed because G is connected, so each irreducible component of \u03c0\u03c6 is\ncovariant.\nWe have only to check the positivity of the energy. But this the content of Corollary\n5.6.\n\u0003\n\n6\n\nThe local isomorphism class of a BCFT net\n\nGiven a local, \u1e20 \u00d7 \u1e20-covariant net of factors B2 on M with chiral subnet isomorphic to\nA \u2297 A, in Section 5 we have shown how to construct finitely many boundary CFT nets B (i)\non M+ based on A\nB (i) (O) \u2261 \u03c0\u0303\u03c6,i (B2 (O)),\n\nO \u2208 K+ , i = 1, . . . n ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 = \u03c0\u0303\u03c6,1 \u2295 \u03c0\u0303\u03c6,2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03c0\u0303\u03c6,n and each \u03c0\u0303\u03c6,i is an irreducible representation of\nC \u2217 (B2 , M+ ).\nThe B (i) are all isomorphic as QFT nets on M+ , so all locally isomorphic, indeed each\nB (i) isomorphic to the restriction of B2 to M+ , and the isomorphism interchanges the representation of A+ . Motivated by the algebraic and tensor categorical description of BCFT,\nwe shall say the two BCFT nets on M+ are Morita equivalent if they are locally isomorphic\nas QFT nets on M+ and the isomorphism interchanges the A+ subnets. The B (i) 's are\nMorita \u0001equivalent since the isomorphism of of B (i) with B|M+ carries the A+ -subnet onto\nA \u2297 A |M+ .\nIn this Section we show that the Morita equivalence class is complete, namely every\nirreducible BCFT net Morita equivalent to B|M+ is unitarily equivalent to one of the B (i) 's.\nThe fact that every BCFT net arise in this way, by restriction of a CFT net on M+ , has\nbeen shown in [30].\n\n16\n\n\fSo let B a BCFT net on M+ based on the chiral (completely rational) local conformal\nnet A, and Morita equivalent to B2 |M+ (in a similar sense as above). Let \u03a9B \u2208 HB be the\nvacuum vector of B and \u03c9 the associated state of C \u2217 (B, M ).\nNotice that the construction of the representation \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 of C \u2217 (B2 , M+ ) only depends on\nthe QFT net B2 |M+ on M+ and its A \u2297 A-subnet. Therefore all we have to show is that\nthe representation \u03c0\u03c9 of C \u2217 (B, M ) is contained in \u03c0\u0303\u03c6 of C \u2217 (B, M ), where \u03c0\u03c9 is the identity\nrepresentation of B, i.e. the GNS representation associated with the vacuum state \u03c9 of B.\nNow the state \u03c6 of B(W ) is invariant under the the conditional expectation: \u03c6 = \u03c60 * \u03b5\nand \u03c9 restricts to \u03c60 on A+ (W ), therefore\n\u03c6(X) = \u03c60 (\u03b5(X)) = \u03c9(\u03b5(X)) \u2265 \u03bb\u03c9(X),\nfor all positive X \u2208 B(W ), due to the Pimsner-Popa inequality \u03b5(X) \u2265 \u03bbX, with \u03bb the\ninverse of the Jones index.\nNamely \u03c9|B(W ) is dominated by \u03c6. Thus \u03c0\u03c9 |B(W ) is the subrepresentation of \u03c0\u03c6 corresponding to a projection z \u2208 B(W )\u2032 = B(M+ )\u2032 by Lemma 5.5. Thus \u03c0\u03c9 is contained in\n\u03c0\u0303\u03c6 .\nSo we have:\nTheorem 6.1. The construction in Theorem 5.7 gives all BCFT nets on M+ that are\ncovariantly locally isomorphic to B2 |M+ .\nIndeed the BCFT nets B (i) in (11) are Morita equivalent and they exhaust the Morita\nequivalence class.\nBy the same construction, we have also implicitly shown that, starting with a BCFT net B\non M+ , all BCFT nets on M+ locally isomorphic to B are obtained as above.\n\nOutlook\nIt would be interesting to extend and analyze our results in various directions.\nFirst of all, an extension of our construction in the setting of [32] could lead to new\nboundary QFT models where one starts with two chiral nets. Related to this point would\nalso be the analysis in the contexts of thermal states and different boundary regions, cf.\n[31, 5, 6].\nA natural problem is to classify the (finitely many) Boundary CFT nets that are obtained\nby adding the boundary to a given completely rational, local conformal net on the Minkowski\nplane. As described in [29], this is related to the computation of the DHR orbits of an\nextension of a corresponding local net A on the boundary real line. One simple example\nwere this can be illustrated is the Ising model A: in this case there are only two irreducible\nchiral extensions: the identity A \u2283 A and the Fermi extensions F \u2283 A. Hence, it follows\nfrom [29] that there are exactly (up to equivalence) two Haag-dual BCFT nets based on A:\nof A+ and a net B whose restriction to the boundary is F (see [29] for\nthe dual net Adual\n+\na description). The two chiral extensions A and F belong to the same DHR orbit (cf. [29,\nand B are both locally equivalent to the unique maximal two-dimensional\npage 950]) so Adual\n+\nextension A2 of A \u2297 A (the Longo-Rehren extension), see also [19]. Now let B\u0303 be any other\nBCF T based on A which is locally isomorphic to A2 and let B\u0303 dual the corresponding dual\nBCFT net. Then, either B\u0303 dual = B or B\u0303 dual = Adual\n+ . In the first case B\u0303 is intermediate\n17\n\n\fbetween A+ and B and the local isomorphism implies that B\u0303 = B as they have the same\ndual and B are the only\nindex. Similarly, in the second case, we have B\u0303 = Adual\n+ . Hence A+\nBCFT nets based on A and locally equivalent to A2 .\nAnother natural problem is to further relate our scheme with the tensor categorial viewpoint, in particular to the analysis of conformal defects, see [13].\nAknwoledgments.
