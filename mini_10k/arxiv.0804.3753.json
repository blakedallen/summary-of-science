Ergodic properties of rational maps are studied, generalising the\nwork of F. Ledrappier. A new construction allows for simpler proofs of stronger\nresults. Very general conformal measures are considered. Equivalent conditions are given for an ergodic invariant probability measure with positive\nLyapunov exponent to be absolutely continuous with respect to a general conformal measure. If they hold, we can construct an induced expanding Markov\nmap with integrable return time which generates the invariant measure.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Overview. For dynamical systems defined by rational maps of the Riemann\nsphere, we study ergodic invariant measures with positive Lyapunov exponents,\ngeneralising and improving upon the important work of Ledrappier ([5]). We construct a set with good Markov properties in the natural extension. In Theorem 8\nwe give equivalent properties for measures to be absolutely continuous with respect\nto a general conformal measure.\nIn the presence of chaotic dynamics, ergodic invariant probability measures give\na good statistical description of the dynamics of points seen by the measure. In\ngeneral there are many such measures and one is interested in measures which see a\nlarge collection of points. Given a reference measure such as Lebesgue measure (if\nthe space is some subset of Euclidean space), one could look for a measure which\nis absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure.\nIn complex dynamics, the Julia set of a rational map f : C \u2192 C is often a fractal\nset of zero Lebesgue measure. When this happens the notion of a t-conformal\nmeasure generalises that of Lebesgue measure (which is a 2-conformal measure).\nA t-conformal measure always exists ([17]) for some t > 0. Its support is the\nwhole Julia set and it is the useful reference measure. In situations with sufficient\nexpansion ([13, 3] amongst others) there exists an ergodic invariant probability\nmeasure which is absolutely continuous with respect to the (in this case unique)\nt-conformal measure.\nWhen an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant probability measure (acip) with\nrespect to a t-conformal measure can be shown to exist, the construction can be\nused to show the measures are equivalent and that the acips have density bounded\nfrom below away from zero and positive Lyapunov exponent. We show that whenever such an acip with positive exponent exists, there exists an expanding induced\nMarkov map with integrable return time which generates the measure (see Definition 7) and the density is bounded away from zero.\nDate: October 29, 2018.\n0\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 37F10, 37D25, 37D35\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\nMore general definitions of conformal measures exist (see Definition 2), and are\nrelated to equilibrium measures for certain potential functions. Our Theorem 8\nbelow states that, given a conformal measure and an ergodic invariant probability\nmeasure \u03bc with positive Lyapunov exponent, there is equivalence between: \u03bc being\nabsolutely continuous; \u03bc satisfying a variant of Pesin's formula; the existence of an\nexpanding induced map which generates \u03bc. Moreover, when these conditions are\nsatisfied the density of \u03bc with respect to the conformal measure is bounded away\nfrom zero.\nAn open set U is called nice, or regularly returning, if f n (\u2202U ) \u2229 U = \u2205 for all\npositive n. This condition implies that if A and B are connected components of\nf \u2212na (U ) and f \u2212nb (U ) respectively, for some na , nb \u2265 0, then A and B are either\nnested or disjoint, that is, A \u2282 B or B \u2282 A or A \u2229 B = \u2205. For polynomial maps the\nwell-known Yoccoz puzzle pieces are nice sets. Nice sets have also been constructed\nby Rivera-Letelier ([15]) for backward-contracting rational maps, and used again\nby Przytycki and Rivera-Letelier in [13]. However, for more general rational maps\nit seems unlikely that nice sets exist.\nTherefore, in order to get the good topological properties of an induced Markov\nmap, we need to select our inverse branches (looking backwards, or the iterates\nlooking forward) with care. The existence of the induced Markov map is new\nand is based on an interesting new concept introduced in this paper: the regularly\nreturning cylinder (Definition 23) in the natural extension. The regularly returning\ncylinder in the natural extension will have this nested or disjoint property for\nprojected preimages without being a nice set itself.\nThis work was inspired by the results of Ledrappier stated in [5]. We give a very\ndifferent proof of the existence of the unstable manifold in the natural extension.\nThe regularly returning cylinders we construct allow us to show (for the measure\nconsidered) the existence of a finite generating partition with good topological\nproperties. This is completely new as far as we are aware. Since the partition\nconstructed has one more element than the degree d of the rational map, it is not\nhard to deduce that the entropy of the measure is bounded by log d. This gives an\nalternate way of proving that the topological entropy is log d.\nA related construction can be found in the historically important article of Ma\u00f1\u00e9,\n[7]. He proved the existence of a good collection of inverse branches of some iterate\nf m of f for the measure of maximal entropy, where m > 1 depends on f . Denker and\nUrbanski ([1]) extended the construction to other measures with positive entropy\n(and thus positive Lyapunov exponent), but m then also depends on the measure.\nThe technique of Ma\u00f1\u00e9 relies heavily on the one-dimensional holomorphic setting.\nOur construction, on the other hand, is based on Pesin theory and more easily\ngeneralisable. It also gives a finite partition with different and interesting properties.\nPassing on to the study of absolutely continuous measures, again our proofs are\nrelatively simple thanks to the regularly returning cylinders. Related results for\nequilibrium measures with respect to H\u00f6lder continuous potentials can be found in\n[10, 1]. The singularity of log |Df |, due to the presence of critical points, complicates\nmatters when one wants to consider more interesting potentials. For the potential\n\u2212t0 log |Df |, where t0 is the hyperbolic dimension of the Julia set or, equivalently,\nthe minimal exponent for which a t-conformal measure exists, [5] contains important\nresults. We extend these to show that existence of an acip implies the existence\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n3\n\nof an induced Markov map with integrable return time, and give an explicit proof\nthat the density is bounded away from zero, a fact used in [13].\nOur definitions of regularly returning cylinders and of Markov maps and our\nproof of the existence of the unstable manifold are not stated in the language of rational dynamics in order to show that these ideas are not particular to holomorphic\ndynamics and will generalise to a higher-dimensional non-conformal setting. We\nnevertheless include extendibility in the definitions for those, including the author,\nwho like their \"Koebe space\".\n1.2. Definitions and main result. As usual when dealing with rational maps, we\nmake use of the spherical metric and derivative. We denote the associated spherical\ndistance by \u03c3(*, *) and the spherical derivative at a point x by |Df (x)|. We use |*| to\ndenote the diameter of a set. All subsets of C considered in this paper are assumed\nto be Borelian.\nDefinition 1. A measure m is t-conformal for rational map f : C \u2192 C and t \u2208 R\nif m(J ) = m(C) = 1 and\nZ\n|Df |t dm\nm(f (A)) =\nA\n\nfor any set A on which f is injective.\n\nWe shall work with a more general definition. Let \u03c6 : C \u2192 C be a H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous function and let t \u2208 R. Consider the relation\nZ\ne\u03c6 |Df |t dm\n(1)\nm(f (A)) =\nA\n\nDefinition 2. If t \u2265 0, a measure m is (\u03c6, t)-conformal for a rational map f if\nm(J ) = m(C) = 1, if (1) holds for every set A on which f is injective. If t < 0,\na measure m is (\u03c6, t)-conformal if m(J ) = m(C) = 1, if (1) holds for every set\nA \u2282 C \\ Crit on which f is injective and if m(Crit) = 0 (see also the related\ndefinition of backward conformal measures in [14], similar when \u03c6 is constant).\nSpherical Lebesgue measure is a (0, 2)-conformal measure. For rational maps of\ndegree d \u2265 2 the measure of maximal entropy has constant Jacobian equal to d so\nit is a (log d, 0)-conformal measure.\nDefinition 3. We denote by M(f ) the collection of ergodic, f -invariant probability\nmeasures.\nDefinition\n4. The Lyapunov exponent of a measure \u03bc \u2208 M(f ) is defined as\nR\n\u03c7\u03bc := log |Df |d\u03bc. The entropy of \u03bc we denote by h\u03bc .\n\nOf course \u2212\u221e \u2264 \u03c7\u03bc < \u221e. If \u03bc is not supported on a periodic attractor, then\n\u03c7\u03bc \u2265 0 by [11].\nDefinition 5. We denote by M+ (f ) the collection of \u03bc \u2208 M(f ) for which \u03c7\u03bc > 0.\n\nDefinition 6. We call a (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure m exceptional if Supp(m) 6= J ,\nand call it non-exceptional if it admits no restriction which, when normalised, is\nan exceptional conformal measure.\nRemark: If t \u2265 0 then m is non-exceptional by the eventually onto property of\nrational maps. Moreover, unless we are in a special case where there is a finite\n\n\f4\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\nforward-invariant set E contained in the post-critcal set P C :=\nsuch that\nf \u22121 (E) \u2282 E \u222a Crit,\n\nS\n\ni\u22650\n\nf i (f (Crit))\n\nthen even if t < 0 the measure m is necessarily non-exceptional. If m is exceptional,\nm is atomic and is supported on such a set E. This exceptional setting is very rare;\ninteresting examples are Latt\u00e8s maps.\nRemark: In the absence of parabolic periodic points in P C, exceptional and nonexceptional (\u03c6, t)-conformal measures cannot co-exist for a given (\u03c6, t).\nDefinition 7. Let f be a rational map with a (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure m. Let U\nand V be open topological balls such that U \u2282 V and m(U ) > 0 and let Ui \u2282 Vi \u2282 U\nsatisfy:\n\u2022 Ui \u2229 UjS6= \u2205 \u21d0\u21d2 i = j;\n\u2022 m(U \\ i Ui ) = 0;\n\u2022 for each i there exists ni such that f ni : Vi \u2192 V is a diffeomorphism with\n|Df ni | > 2 and f ni (Ui ) = U ;\n\u2022 there exist C, \u03b4 > 0 such that, for each i and all j \u2264 ni ,\n|Df j (x)| > Ce\u03b4j\nfor all x in f ni \u2212j (Ui ).\nS\nni\n. Then \u03c8 is called an expanding induced\nDefine \u03c8 : i Ui \u2192 U by \u03c8|Ui := f|U\ni P\nMarkov map for (f, m). If additionally\ni ni m(Ui ) < \u221e then we say \u03c8 has integrable return time. Let \u03bd be the unique (c.f. Lemma 35) absolutely continuous\n\u03c8-invariant probability measure. It has bounded density. The following measure,\nwhen normalised, is a well-defined, ergodic, absolutely continuous f -invariant probability measure which we say is generated by \u03c8:\n\u03bd :=\n\ni \u22121\nX nX\n\ni\n\nf\u2217j \u03bd.\n\nj=0\n\nTheorem 8. Let f be a rational map of the Riemann sphere and m a nonexceptional (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure for f . Let \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). The following conditions are equivalent:\n1\u25e6 . \u03bc << m;\n2\u25e6 . there exist \u03b5 > 0 and a measurable density function \u03c1 \u2265 \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03bc = \u03c1m\non an open Rset U of positive measure, and if t \u2265 0 one can take U = C;\n3\u25e6 . h\u03bc = t\u03c7\u03bc + R\u03c6d\u03bc;\n\u03c6d\u03bc\n4\u25e6 . HD(\u03bc) = t + \u03c7\u03bc ;\n5\u25e6 . there exists an expanding induced Markov map for (f, m) with integrable return\ntime which generates \u03bc.\nShould the equivalent conditions hold then m is ergodic and unique and \u03bc is the\nunique measure in M+ (f ) satisfying any of the equivalent conditions.\nProof. Clearly 5\u25e6 \u21d2 1\u25e6 . In Proposition 29 we show 1\u25e6 \u21d2 4\u25e6 . By the Dynamical\nVolume Lemma (Proposition 28) 4\u25e6 \u21d0\u21d2 3\u25e6 . In Proposition 34 we prove 3\u25e6 \u21d2 2\u25e6\nand 3\u25e6 \u21d2 5\u25e6 .\n\u0003\nRemark: If m is exceptional then one can show easily that 1\u25e6 implies 3\u25e6 , 4\u25e6 and\n5\u25e6 , and that 5\u25e6 \u21d2 1\u25e6 . We no longer necessarily have that 3\u25e6 implies absolute\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n5\n\ncontinuity: consider the quadratic Chebyshev map x 7\u2192 4x(1 \u2212 x). For t = \u22121,\nthere are two equilibrium measures. One is the measure for maximal entropy, the\nother is the unit mass on {0} which is absolutely continuous with respect to the\nunique (log 4, \u22121)-conformal measure.\n1.3. Equilibrium measures and the pressure function. In carrying out this\nwork, we bore in mind the idea that a measure \u03bc satisfying the equivalent conditions\nin the preceding theorem should be the equilibrium measure for some potential\nfunction related to \u03c6 and to t.\nOne can consider the (variational) pressure\nZ\nP (\u03c6, t) := Pvar (\u03c6, t) := sup (h\u03bc + (\u2212\u03c6 \u2212 t log |Df |) d\u03bc),\n\u03bc\u2208M(f )\n\n(for the potential \u2212\u03c6\u2212t log |Df |). A measure which realises the supremum is called\nan equilibrium measure for that potential. A measure \u03bc verifying the equivalent\nconditions in Theorem 8 is an equilibrium measure provided P (\u03c6, t) = 0.\nGiven some function \u03c6\u2032 , one can set \u03c6 := \u03c6\u2032 +P (\u03c6\u2032 , t). Then P (\u03c6, t) = 0. One can\nexpect that, when P (\u03c6, t) = 0, there will exist a (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure. When\nt = 0 this can be found in [1, 10]; existence of equilibrium states is also shown.\nNow let us consider the natural potential \u2212t log |Df | and the corresponding\npressure function\nZ\nP (t) := P (0, t) = sup h\u03bc \u2212 t log |Df | d\u03bc.\n\u03bc\u2208M(f )\n\nPrzytycki, Rivera-Letelier and Smirnov, generalising the work of Denker and Urba\u0144ski\nand Przytycki ([2, 11]), have shown the existence of (P (t), t)-conformal measures\nfor rational maps for all t \u2208 R (proof of proposition 1.2 and section A.2 in [14]).\nMoreover, they show that for t \u2265 0, P (t) is the infimum of p \u2208 R such that there exists a (p, t)-conformal measure. For t < 0, if m is a non-exceptional (p, t)-conformal\nmeasure, they show an even stronger statement, p = P (t).\nCorollary 9. Let f be a rational map of the Riemann sphere, t \u2265 0, and let\n\u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). If p \u2208 R and m is a (p, t)-conformal measure such that \u03bc << m, then\np = P (t) and \u03bc is an equilibrium measure.\nProof. We know already p \u2265 P (t). By Theorem 8, p = h\u03bc \u2212 t\u03c7\u03bc , thus p \u2264 P (t).\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 10. Let f be a rational map of the Riemann sphere, t \u2265 0, let m be a\n(P (t), t)-conformal measure and let \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). Suppose h\u03bc \u2212 t\u03c7\u03bc = P (t). Then\n\u03bc is equivalent to m. In particular, \u03bc is the unique equilibrium state with positive\nLyapunov exponent for the potential \u2212t log |Df | and m is ergodic.\nRemark: Przytycki ([12]) conjectured that, for t equal to the first zero of the\npressure function, there was a unique equilibrium state with positive exponent. For\nthat particular value of t, the answer can be shown using the work of Ledrappier\n([5]). Rephrasing the previous corollary, we answer a stronger question:\nCorollary 11. For each t \u2265 0, there is at most one equilibrium state with positive\nLyapunov exponent for the potential \u2212t log |Df |.\nRemark: Provided P (t) 6= 0, any equilibrium state for the potential \u2212t log |Df | has\npositive Lyapunov exponent.\n\n\f6\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\nThe case t < 0 was studied by Makarov and Smirnov ([6]) who used operator\ntheory to show existence of equilibrium states and conformal measures and to study\nuniqueness of equilibrium states and analyticity of the pressure function. One can\napproach this differently. As recalled in [14], the Patterson-Sullivan method for\nconstructing conformal measures easily produces a (P (t), t)-conformal measure (one\ndoes need to take care with the definitions of pressure). Let\nt0 := inf{t : there exists a non-exceptional (P (t), t)-conformal measure}.\nProposition 12. For each t \u2208 (t0 , 0] there is a unique equilibrium measure and a\nunique (P (t), t)-conformal measure.\nProof. Existence of equilibrium measures follows from upper semi-continuity of h\u03bc\nand \u03c7\u03bc . Let m be a (P (t), t)-conformal measure, necessarily non-exceptional since\nexceptional and non-exceptional measures cannot co-exist. By Theorem 8, m and\n\u03bc are equivalent, thus m is ergodic. Any other equilibrium state must also be\nequivalent to m and thus to \u03bc and thus coincides with \u03bc.\n\u0003\nFor t > 0, in a work-in-progress, Przytycki and Rivera-Letelier show the existence\nof equilibrium states for all t in a neighbourhood of [0, P \u22121 (0)] for a large class of\nmaps (the Topological Collet-Eckmann class). We expect existence of equilibrium\nstates to hold for all rational maps for all t strictly less than the first zero of the\npressure function.\n1.4. Acknowledgements.

The Natural Extension [16, 5]: Let Y \u2282 C be the set of sequences\ny = (y0 , y1 , . . .) such that f (yi+1 ) = yi and define F : Y \u2192 Y by\nF (y0 , y1 , . . .) = (f (y0 ), y0 , y1 , . . .).\nThen F : Y \u2192 Y is invertible. We shall denote by \u03a0 the projection onto the first\nelement, i.e. \u03a0y = y0 .\nIf f has an invariant measure \u03bc then there is a unique measure \u03bc on Y , invariant\nby F , such that \u03a0\u2217 \u03bc = \u03bc. If \u03bc is ergodic then so is \u03bc, and importantly \u03bc is also an\nergodic invariant measure for the inverse map F \u22121 . We call (Y, F, \u03bc) the natural\nextension of (C, f, \u03bc).\nIn this section we shall provide an alternative proof of the well-known result of\nLedrappier ([5]) on existence of the unstable manifold in the natural extension. Our\nproof is very elementary and does not rely on non-flatness of the critical points.\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n7\n\nRecall that the spherical distance we denote by \u03c3(*, *) and the spherical derivative\nof f by |Df |.\nProposition 14. Let f be a rational map of C. Suppose f hasR an invariant, ergodic\nprobability measure \u03bc with positive Lyapunov exponent \u03c7 = log |Df | d\u03bc > 0. Let\n(Y, F, \u03bc) be the natural extension for (f, \u03bc).\nThen there exists a measurable function \u03b1 on Y , positive almost everywhere,\nsuch that, if y \u2208 Y and \u03b1(y) > 0:\n\u2022 there exists a set Vy \u2282 Y with y \u2208 Vy and \u03a0Vy = B(\u03a0y, \u03b1(y));\n\u2022 for all n \u2265 0, f n : \u03a0F \u2212n Vy \u2192 \u03a0Vy is a diffeomorphism;\n\u2022 for all y \u2032 \u2208 Vy\n\u221e\nX\n\nlog |Df (\u03a0F \u2212i y \u2032 )| \u2212 log |Df (\u03a0F \u2212i y)| < log 2.\n\ni=1\n\nFor each \u03b7 > 0 there exists a measurable function \u03c1 on Y , positive almost everywhere, such that if \u03c1(y) > 0 and if n \u2265 0 and y \u2032 \u2208 Vy , then\n\u03c1(y)\u22121 en(\u03c7\u2212\u03b7) \u2264 |Df n (\u03a0F \u2212n y \u2032 )| \u2264 \u03c1(y)en(\u03c7+\u03b7) .\nIn particular, |\u03a0F \u2212n Vy | \u2264 \u03c1(y)e\u2212n(\u03c7\u2212\u03b7) |C|.\nThe strategy is as follows. First we show that we have a good distortion bound\non B(x, min(c0 , |Df (x)|3 )) for some constant c0 . Then we show that the derivative\n|Df (\u03a0F \u2212n y)| along backwards orbits is bounded from below by a sub-exponential\nsequence almost everywhere. This allows us to define a sequence of balls on which\none has (slow-) exponentially good distortion. Positive Lyapunov exponent will\nthen imply that the pullbacks of some small ball will always land inside the balls\nwith exponentially good distortion bounds, so the total distortion will be summable.\nLemma 15. Let f : C \u2192 C be a rational map. Then there exists a c0 > 0 with the\nfollowing property. For all c such that 0 < c < c0 , if x, x\u2032 \u2208 C, \u03c3(x, x\u2032 ) < c3 and\n|Df (x)| > c, then\n|Df (x)|\nlog\n< c.\n|Df (x\u2032 )|\nProof.

It is immediate that if ni (y), ni+1 (y) \u2208\n{nj (y)}, then ni+1 (y) \u2212 ni (y) = 1, and we showed that for each such n the minimal\nk is \u2264 M .\nSuppose first there is a positive measure subset C of A2 such that for each y in\nC the set {nj (y)} is infinite (and thus equal to N). Then (6) gives that\ndist(\u03a0F \u2212n Vy , Fix(M !)) \u2264 \u03b8(|\u03a0F \u2212n Vy |).\nBut |\u03a0F \u2212n Vy | is exponentially decreasing, so dist (\u03a0F \u2212n Vy , Fix(M !)) tends to\nzero (and this uniformly in y \u2208 A2 ), by Lemma 22.

In this case the theorem is easy.\nOtherwise, for almost every y in A2 , the set {nj (y)} is finite; let n(y) denote its\nmaximum (defined as zero if the set is empty).

Set\n[\nA :=\nUy\ny\u2208A4\n\nand the theorem follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Partitions\nFirst we show that there is a nice partition of Y . Let A be a regularly returning\ncylinder for (Y, F, \u03bc). For y \u2208 Y let e(y) be the first entry time of y into A, that\nis, e(y) := inf{n \u2265 0 : F n y \u2208 A}. This is defined (finite) almost everywhere by\nergodicity, and one can set\n\u03be(y) := F \u2212e(y) UF e(y) y .\nIf y does not enter A, set \u03be(y) := \u2205. By the regularly returning property, e(y) = e(y \u2032 )\nand \u03be(y) = \u03be(y \u2032 ) for all y \u2032 \u2208 \u03be(y). Thus one can define a partition \u03be of Y where the\nelement of \u03be containing y is \u03be(y) (up to a set of measure zero - alternatively one\ncan add back the complement, a set of measure zero).\nProposition 25. Given any regularly returning cylinder A for (Y, F, \u03bc), there exists\na measurable partition \u03be of Y such that, if \u03be(y) denotes the element of \u03be containing\ny and e(y) the first entry time of y to A, then\nF e(y) \u03be(y) = UF e(y) y .\nFor any y, y \u2032 in Y , \u03a0\u03be(y) and \u03a0\u03be(y \u2032 ) are either nested or disjoint, and \u03be(y) and\n\u03be(y \u2032 ) are either nested or disjoint.\nProof. Immediate.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow we can define a first partition \u03b6 of C (modulo a set of measure zero). Let\n[\n\u03b6(z) :=\n\u03a0\u03be(y).\n\u03a0y=z\n\nThis is a countable partition of C with the property that each element gets mapped\nby an iterate of f diffeomorphically (and with bounded distortion) to U = \u03a0A \u2208 \u03b6.\nAlso, any element of Q \u2208 \u03b6 \\ {U } has the property that f (Q) is contained in an\nelement of \u03b6. We would now like to construct a finite generating partition with\ngood topological properties.\nProposition 26. Let f be a rational map of degree d and let \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). Let\nA be a regularly returning cylinder for (Y, F, \u03bc) with base U . Then there exists a\nmeasurable partition P with the following properties:\n\u2022 P has at most d + 1 elements P0 , . . . , Pd ;\n\u2022 f is injective on each partition element;\n\u2022 one partition element P0 \u2208 P is the base U ;\n\u2022 f \u22121 (f (U )) \u2229 Pd = \u2205;\n\u2022 each connected component of a partition element is mapped by an iterate of\nf diffeomorphically to U , and moreover is the projection of an element of\nthe partition \u03be of Proposition 25;\n\u2022 the projection of each element of \u03be is contained in exactly one element of\nP;\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n13\n\n\u2022 the partition is generating.\nProof. We shall define the partition elements P0 , . . . , Pd of the partition P by distributing the elements of \u03b6 to them. Firstly set P0 := U . To each Q \u2208 \u03b6 there is a\nunique nQ \u2265 0 such that f nQ Q = U . Let \u03b6n := {Q \u2208 \u03b6 : nQ = n}. For all n \u2265 1,\nfor all Q \u2208 \u03b6n , one has f (Q) \u2282 Q\u2032 \u2208 \u03b6m for someSQ\u2032 , mS\nsatisfying 0 \u2264 m < n.\nSuppose P0 , P1n , P2n , . . . , Pdn is a partition of m<n Q\u2208\u03b6m Q such that f is injective on each partition element, initialising Pi0 := \u2205 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d.\n\u2022 Consider\nan element Q of \u03b6n and let \u03b6Q be collection of elements Q\u2032 \u220b\nS\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nj\u2264n \u03b6j such that f (Q ) \u2229 f (Q) 6= \u2205. It follows that for Q \u2208 \u03b6Q , f (Q ) \u2283\nf (Q). Since f is d-to-one, there are at most d elements in \u03b6Q . The elements\nof \u03b6Q \\\u03b6n are already subsets of distinct partition elements Pi . We distribute\nthe remaining ones (contained in \u03b6Q \u2229 \u03b6n ), so that each element of \u03b6Q is a\nsubset of a different Pin+1 :\n\u2022 For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d let Pi\u2032 := Pin .\n\u2022 Order \u03b6Q \u2229 \u03b6n =: Q1 , . . . Qk . Let i1 := inf{i \u2265 1 : f (Q1 ) \u2229 f (Pi ) = \u2205}. Let\ni2 := inf{i > i1 : f (Q2 ) \u2229 f (Pi ) = \u2205}. Continue inductively and replace\nPi\u2032j by Pi\u2032j \u222a Qj for j = 1, . . . , k. It follows from the construction that f\nremains injective on each Pi\u2032 and U \u2229 Pd\u2032 = \u2205.\n\u2022 Repeat until there are no further elements in \u03b6n , that is, until for all Q \u2208 \u03b6n\nthere exists an i such that Q \u2282 Pi\u2032 .\n\u2022 Set Pin+1 := Pi\u2032 for i = 1, . . . , d.\nS\nWe proceed inductively, exhausting all of \u03b6, setting Pi := n\u22650 Pin for i = 1, . . . d,\nand P := {P0 , P1 , . . . , Pd }.\nIt remains to show that theWpartition is generating, that is that on a set of full\nn\nmeasure the partitions Pn := i=0 f \u2212i P tends to the partition into points. Let X\nbe a set of full measure such that for all x \u2208 X there is a y \u2208 \u03a0\u22121 x such that y\nenters A infinitely often (this set X exists by ergodicity and the positivity of the\nmeasure of A).\nSuppose x, x\u2032 \u2208 X are in the same element of Pn for all n \u2265 0. There are a\ny \u2208 \u03a0\u22121 x and an infinite sequence nj \u0580 \u221e such that F nj y \u2208 A. Thus there is an\ninfinite sequence Uj such that f nj : Uj \u2192 U \u2208 P is a diffeomorphism. For each\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 nj , f i (Uj ) is contained in an element of \u03b6 and thus in an element of P.\nNow f is injective on each partition element, so\nUj \u2208 Pnj .\nWe also have by Theorem 24 that |Uj | < \u03c10 e\u2212nj (\u03c7\u2212\u03b7) |U |, so |Uj | \u0581 0 and x =\nx\u2032 .\n\u0003\nLemma 27. Let A be a regularly returning cylinder with base U . Let P be the\npartition of C given by Proposition 26. Then for each x in a set X of full measure,\nthere exists a strictly monotone sequence nj \u0580 \u221e and corresponding sets Uj \u220b x\nsuch that\nn\n\u2022 limj\u2192\u221e jj > 0, so\nnj\n= 1;\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e nj+1\n\u2022 f nj : Uj \u2192 U is a diffeomorphism with uniformly bounded distortion;\n\u2022 lim n1 log |Df nj (x)| = \u03c7;\n\u2022 dist(f nj (x), \u2202U ) \u2265 \u03b5 for some \u03b5 > 0;\n\n\f14\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\n\u2022 Uj is an element of the partition Pnj =\n\nWnj\n\ni=0\n\nf \u2212i P.\n\nProof. We have essentially proven this already. Let B be a subset of A such that\n\u03bc(B) > 0 and dist(\u03a0B, \u2202U ) \u2265 \u03b5 for some \u03b5 > 0. Almost every point x is the\nprojection of a point y \u2208 Y which enters B, by ergodicity, at successive times nj\nwith limj\u2192\u221e j/nj = \u03bc(B). Then the element of the partition Pnj containing x is\n\u03a0F \u2212nj UF nj y . The uniform bound on the distortion comes from the definition of\nregularly returning cylinders. Since F nj y \u2208 B, one has dist(f nj (x), \u2202U ) \u2265 \u03b5.\n\u0003\n5. Dimensions of measures\nIn this section we give short proofs of two results concerning the dimension of a\nmeasure, making use of the partitions of Section 4. The Hausdorff dimension of a\nmeasure, denoted HD(\u03bc), is defined as the infimum of Hausdorff dimensions of sets\nof full measure. In dimension one, a theorem proving that\nHD(\u03bc) =\n\nh\u03bc\n\u03c7\u03bc\n\nfor an ergodic invariant probability measure with positive Lyapuonv exponent for\nsome class of maps is called a Dynamical Volume Lemma. Our proof of the following\nwell-known result is shorter than usual as we have at our disposal a finite generating\npartition with good properties.\nProposition 28 ([5]). Let f : C \u2192 C be a rational map and \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). Then\nfor almost all x with respect to \u03bc,\nlim\n\nr\u21920\n\nh\u03bc\nlog \u03bc(B(x, r))\n.\n=\nlog r\n\u03c7\u03bc\n\nIn particular,\nHD(\u03bc) =\n\nh\u03bc\n.\n\u03c7\u03bc\n\nProof. We write \u03c7 for \u03c7\u03bc . Let (Y, F, \u03bc) be the natural extension. Let \u03b7 be a\nsmall positive constant. Let A be a regularly returning cylinder given by Theorem\n24, \u03be a corresponding partition of Y given by Proposition 25 and P = {P0 =\nU = \u03a0A, P1 , . . . , Pd } a corresponding finite generating partition of C given by\nProposition 26. The result essentially follows from Lemma 27: let X be a set of\nfull measure given\nWn by this lemma.\nLet Pn := i=0 f \u2212i P and Pn (x) the element of Pn containing x. By the\nShannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem ([8] p.39), there is a set X \u2032 \u2282 X of full\nmeasure such that\n\u22121\nh\u03bc = lim\nlog \u03bc(Pn (x))\nn\u2192\u221e n\nfor all x \u2208 X \u2032 . Now fix x \u2208 X \u2032 and let nj and Uj be given by Lemma 27. Then\nUj = Pnj (x). Thus\n\u22121\nlog \u03bc(Uj ).\nh\u03bc = lim\nj\u2192\u221e nj\nNow the uniform bound on the distortion together with dist(f nj (x), \u2202U ) \u2265 \u03b5 > 0\nimplies that there are annuli Aj \u2283 \u2202Uj centred on x such that the moduli Aj are\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n15\n\nuniformly bounded. Let rj be the inner radius and Rj the outer, and K such that\nnj\n= 1, we have\nRj \u2264 Krj .

Let f be a rational map of the Riemann sphere and m a nonexceptional (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure for f . Suppose \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ) is absolutely continuous with respect to m.\nR\n\u03c6d\u03bc\nThen \u03bc and m are equivalent and HD(\u03bc) = t + \u03c7\u03bc .\nProof. First let us show equivalence of the measures. Suppose there exists a set B\nsuch that m(B) > 0 but \u03bc(B) = 0. Then\n[\nf \u2212i (B)\nX := C \\\ni\u22650\n\nis a forward-invariant set of full \u03bc-measure disjoint from B. Combining the density\npoint theorem with Lemma 27, for \u03bc almost every point x \u2208 X, there exist Uj such\nthat\nm(X \u2229 Uj )\nlim\n=1\nj\u2192\u221e\nm(Uj )\nand f nj : Uj \u220b x :\u2192 U has uniformly bounded distortion. Thus m(X \u2229 U ) = m(U ).\nThen the eventually onto property implies m(C \u2229 X) = m(C) (we use here that m\nis non-exceptional). But then m(B) = 0, contradiction.\nNow it suffices to show the dimension estimate for m instead of \u03bc. Let x be a\ntypical point (for m or for \u03bc, it is the same thing) and let Uj , rj and Rj be as per\nthe proof of the preceding proposition. As before, we get\nlog m(B(x, r))\nlog m(Uj+1 )\nlog m(Uj )\n\u2264 lim\n,\n\u2264 lim\nr\u21920\nj\u2192\u221e\nj\u2192\u221e log rj+1\nlog r\nlog Rj\nlim\n\nprovided the limits exist.\n\n\f16\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\nR\nIt now suffices to show that limj\u2192\u221e (\u22121/nj ) log m(Uj ) = \u03c7\u03bc t + \u03c6d\u03bc for almost\nevery x. But conformality implies that\nZ\n\u2032\neSnj \u03c8(x ) dm(x\u2032 ),\nm(U ) =\nUj\n\nPn\u22121\n\nwhere Sn \u03c8 := i=0 (t log |Df | + \u03c6) \u25e6 f i . By Lemma 31 the integrand has uniformly\nbounded variation on the sets Uj . Thus\nm(U ) \u2248 m(Uj )eSnj \u03c8(x)\nand so\nlim (\u22121/nj ) log m(Uj ) = lim (1/nj )Snj \u03c8(x).\nj\u2192\u221e\nR\nBy ergodicity, the right-hand term tends to t\u03c7\u03bc + \u03c6d\u03bc.\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0003\n\n6. Entropy\n\nThe goal of this section is to show that h\u03bc = H(F \u22121 \u03be|\u03be) for the partition \u03be of\nthe natural extension given by Proposition 25. This partition is not (or does not\nseem to be) the future of some finite generating partition (which would imply the\nresult), so there is something to be proved here.\nProposition 30. Given a rational map f , \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ) and natural extension\n(Y, F, \u03bc), let A be a regularly returning cylinder and \u03be the corresponding partition\nof Y given by Proposition 25.

Let P be the\nfinite generating partition given by Proposition 26 and \u03a0\u22121 P the induced finite\ngenerating partition of Y , so H(F, \u03a0\u22121 P) = h\u03bc .

Associated to each partition is a canonical system of conditional probability measures, also\ncalled the Rohlin decomposition of \u03bc with respect to that partition. Let p\u03be (y, *)\nbe the decomposition of \u03bc with respect to \u03be, so for (almost) all y, p\u03be (y, *) is a\nprobability measure on \u03be(y) and for all X \u2282 Y ,\nZ\np\u03be (y, X \u2229 \u03be(y))d\u03bc.\n\u03bc(X) =\nY\n\n/ A, \u03be(y) =\nLet p\u03b6 (y, *) be the Rohlin decomposition of \u03bc with respect to \u03b6.

In the following proposition, q(y, *) is an educated guess as to the Rohlin decomposition: it could be derived\ndirectly if we knew in advance that \u03bc(B) = limn\u2192\u221e m(f \u2212n B) for all measurable\nsets B.\nProposition 32. Let f : C \u2192 C be a rational map and \u03bc \u2208 M+ (f ). Let (Y, F, \u03bc) be\nthe natural extension and A be a regularly returning cylinder and \u03be the corresponding\npartition given by Proposition 25.\nSupposeRthat there is a non-exceptional (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure m such that\nh\u03bc = t\u03c7 + \u03c6d\u03bc. Let \u03c8 and \u03a6 be defined as per Lemma 31.\nThe Rohlin decomposition of \u03bc with respect to the partition \u03be is given by q(y, *),\nwhere\n(11)\n\nq(y, dz) := R\n\n\u03a6(y, z)dm\u03be(y) (z)\n,\n\u03a6(y, y \u2032 )dm\u03be(y) (y \u2032 )\n\u03be(y)\n\nwhere m\u03be(y) is the pullback by \u03a0|\u03be(y) of the conformal measure m restricted to \u03a0\u03be(y).\nProof. The proof of this proposition is very similar to that of proposition 3.6 of [4];\nwe include it for the reader's convenience.\nFirstly, note that since \u03c7\u03bc > 0, \u03bc is supported on the Julia set, and m is nonexceptional, so m is positive on the \u03a0\u03be(y) for \u03bc-almost every y. Since \u03a6 is uniformly\nbounded away from zero, q(y, *) is well-defined almost everywhere.\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n19\n\nIt follows from (11) that q(y, *) is a probability measure on \u03be(y), and that if\n\u03be(y1 ) = \u03be(y2R) then q(y1 , *) = q(y2 , *) by multiplying above and below by \u03a6(y1 , y2 ).\nSet k(y) := \u03be(y) \u03a6(y, y \u2032 )dm(y \u2032 ).

Under the same hypotheses, \u03bc is absolutely continuous with respect\nto the (\u03c6, t)-conformal measure m.\nProposition 34.

Then the density of \u03bc is bounded from below by a constant \u03b5 > 0 on an open\nset U and there exists an expanding induced Markov map for (f, m) with integrable\nreturn time which generates \u03bc. If t \u2265 0 then the density of \u03bc is bounded away from\nzero almost everywhere with respect to m.\n\n\f20\n\nNEIL DOBBS\n\nProof. Let A be a regularly returning cylinder with base U and let \u03be be the corresponding partition. Let \u03bcA := \u03bc|A . Since \u03a6, as defined in Lemma 31, is uniformly\nbounded away from zero and infinity on A, the density of \u03a0\u2217 \u03bcA is bounded away\nfrom zero and infinity on U . In particular it is bounded from below by some constant \u03b5 > 0. Since \u03a0\u2217 \u03bcA (C) \u2264 \u03bc(\u03a0\u2212n C) = \u03bc(C), the density \u03c1 of \u03bc is bounded\nfrom below by \u03b5 > 0 on U .\nBy the eventually onto property, there exists a finite n such that f n (U ) \u2283 J .\nBy invariance of \u03bc and conformality of m, for each x \u2208 U ,\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n.\n\u03c1(f n (x)) \u2265 \u03b5 |Df n (x)|t eSn \u03c6(x)\n\nIn particular, if t \u2265 0 then the density is bounded away from zero everywhere on\nJ and thus on C.\nLet N > 0 be large enough that for all n \u2265 N , for all y \u2208 A, |Df n (\u03a0F \u2212n y)| > 2\nand for each y \u2208 A let m(y) denote the N th return time of y to A. In particular\nm(y) > N almost everywhere on A, and by a simple extension of Kac's Theorem\n([9], theorem 2.4.6),\nZ\nm(y)d\u03bc = N.\n\nA\n\nThen {\u03a0F \u2212m(y) \u03be(F m(y) ) : y \u2208 A} is a cover of a subset X \u2282 U of full measure by\nnested or disjoint topological balls which get mapped by an iterate of f diffeomorphically onto U with extensions that get mapped onto V .

Let \u03c8 : i Ui \u2192 U be an expanding Markov map for (f, m). Then\nthere is an absolutely continuous \u03c8-invariant probability measure \u03bd on U . The\ndensity of \u03bd with respect to m is bounded away from zero and infinity.\nProof. By the Koebe principle, there is a uniform bound on the distortion of \u03c8 n\non connected components of its domain. We now want to show that SN \u03c6 does\nnot vary much either on a connected component W of the domain of \u03c8 n , where\n\u03c8 n = f N on W .\n\n\fHYPERBOLIC AND CONFORMAL MEASURES\n\n21\n\nRecall that, by the definition of \u03c8, there exists C, \u03b4 > 0 such that, for each i and\nall j \u2264 ni ,\n|Df j (x)| > Ce\u03b4j\nfor all x \u2208 f ni \u2212j (Ui ) where ni is given by \u03c8|Ui = f ni .\nWe wish to show that there are constants C0 , \u03b40 > 0 such that |f j (W )| \u2264\nC0 exp((j \u2212 N )\u03b40 ) for all j \u2264 N . For this, using the previous paragraph, it suffices\nto show that there is a constant \u03b41 such that |W | \u2264 exp(\u2212N \u03b41 ) for all such W, N .\nLet M > 0 be small enough that C M exp(\u03b4) > 1. Then, considering the cases\nn \u2265 N M and n < N M we deduce, for all x \u2208 W ,\n\u0001\n|D\u03c8 n (x)| = |Df N (x)| > min 2N M , C N M exp(N \u03b4)\n\n(since |D\u03c8| > 2 everywhere). We can set \u03b41 := log min(2M , C M exp(\u03b4)).\nNow, by H\u00f6lder continuity of \u03c6, there are C \u2032 , \u01eb > 0 such that for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 C,\n|\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(x\u2032 )| \u2264 C \u2032 |x \u2212 x\u2032 |\u01eb . We deduce that if x, x\u2032 \u2208 W then\n\u221e\nX\nC \u2032 (C0 exp(\u2212j\u03b40 ))\u01eb < C2\nSN \u03c6(x) \u2212 SN \u03c6(x\u2032 ) \u2264\nj=0\n\nfor some constant C2 < \u221e, and this independently of n and W .\nThis completes the first step. The rest of the proof is standard.\n1\nSince m(U ) = m(\u03c8 \u22121 (U )), for all i \u2265 1, \u03bdi := m(U)\n(\u03c8 \u2212i )\u2217 m is a probability\nmeasure. By the distortion bound and the bound on SN \u03c6(x) \u2212 SN \u03c6(x\u2032 ), there is a\nconstant C3 such that\nm(A)\nm(A)\n\u03bdi (A)\nC3\u22121\n\u2264\n\u2264 C3\nm(B)\n\u03bdi (B)\nm(B)\nfor all measurable sets A, B \u2282 U .
