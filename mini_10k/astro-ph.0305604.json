However, in spite of significant progress in recent years, there remain unanswered\nfundamental questions about the basic physics of star formation. It remains unclear whether\nmolecular clouds have lifetimes significantly longer than their free-fall collapse times \u03c4f f , typically \u223c 106 years (Hartman et al. (2001), Palla & Stahler (2002)). If self-gravitating clouds\nand cores have long lifetimes (>> \u03c4f f ), they must be supported against gravitational collapse. One view is that magnetic fields provide this support. Detailed theoretical work on the\nevolution of clouds with initially magnetically subcritical masses (i.e., fields strong enough\nto support the cloud), with ambipolar diffusion driving cloud evolution and star formation,\nhave been carried out by a number of groups (e.g., Mouschovias & Ciolek (1999)). The other\nextreme from the magnetically dominated star formation point of view is that molecular\nclouds are intermittent phenomena in an interstellar medium dominated by turbulence, and\nthe problem of cloud support for long time periods is irrelevant (e.g., Elmegreen (2000)).\nHowever, even if magnetic fields turn out to be too weak to provide cloud support, they\nappear to be essential for star formation in any case. A star-forming cloud must lose most\nof its angular momentum to its surroundings in order to collapse. Outward angular momentum transport by Alfv\u00e9n waves seems to be the only mechanism available for this process\n(Mouschovias & Paleologou 1986).\nHence, theoretical studies suggest that magnetic fields may play an important or even\ncrucial role in the evolution of interstellar clouds and in the formation of stars. But the\nissue is far from settled, on either observational or theoretical grounds. The\n\u221a critical value\nfor the mass that can be supported by a magnetic flux \u03a6 is MBcrit = \u03a6/2\u03c0 G (Nakano &\nNakamura 1978); the precise value of the numerical coefficient is slightly model dependant\n(e.g., Mouschovias & Spitzer (1976); McKee et al. (1993)). The crucial parameter is then the\nratio of the mass to the magnetic flux, M/\u03a6; observational determination of this parameter\nwill answer the question whether magnetic fields support clouds and ambipolar diffusion\ngoverns the subsequent collapse of clouds to form stars.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWe can state M/\u03a6 in units of the critical value and define \u03bb \u2261 (M/\u03a6)actual /(M/\u03a6)crit .\n\u03bb is generally either an assumed or a free parameter in theoretical models of star formation;\nit must be determined empirically. Inferring \u03bb from observations is possible if the column\ndensity N and the magnetic field strength B are measured:\nmNA/BA\n(M/\u03a6)observed\n\u221a\n=\n\u03bb=\n= 7.6 \u00d7 10\u221221 N(H2 )/B\n(1)\n(M/\u03a6)crit\n1/2\u03c0 G\nwhere m = 2.8mH allowing for 10% He by number, with N(H2 ) in cm\u22122 and B in \u03bcG. Note\nthat the area A over which M and \u03a6 are measured cancels, although of course B and N\nmust be measured over the indentical area of a cloud.\nUntil recently, measurement of magnetic field strengths by observations of the Zeeman\neffect in potential star formation regions has been the only method by which \u03bb has been\ndetermined. Crutcher (1999) analyzed all Zeeman data available for molecular cloud cores\nin order to infer the mean value \u03bb\u0304 in molecular clouds. He found that \u03bb\u0304 \u223c 2, indicating that\ncores are slightly supercritical, i.e., their magnetic fields are too weak for support against\ngravity by magnetic pressure alone. However, Zeeman detections are rather sparse, particularly in prestellar (Ward-Thompson et al. 1994) cores. Hence, it is crucially important that\na more statistically valid sample of measurements of magnetic field strengths in molecular\ncores be obtained.\nAlthough observations of the polarization of emission from dust grains do not directly\nyield the magnitude of the magnetic field, in the early days of interstellar polarization studies\nChandrasekhar & Fermi (1953) suggested that analysis of the small-scale randomness of\nmagnetic field lines could yield estimates of the field strengths. The method depends on the\nfact that turbulent motions will lead to non-uniform magnetic fields (since under interstellar\nconditions fields will be frozen into the matter). There will therefore be a perturbed or\nMHD-wave component to the field that should show up as an irregular scatter in polarization\npositions angles relative to those that would be produced by a regular magnetic field. They\nshowed that the magnitude of that irregularity of field lines could yield the regular field\nstrength in the plane of the sky:\np\np\nn(H2 ) \u2206V\n\u03b4V\nBpos = Q 4\u03c0\u03c1\n\u2248 9.3\n\u03bcG,\n(2)\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\nwhere \u03c1 = mn(H2 ) is the gas density, \u03b4V is the velocity dispersion, \u03b4\u03c6 is the dispersion in\npolarization position angles (in degrees on the right-hand side), Q is a factor\n\u221a of order unity,\n\u22123\nn(H2 ) is the molecular hydrogen density in molecules cm , and \u2206V = 8ln2 \u03b4V is the\nFWHM line width in km s\u22121 .\nIt is important to know how well the indirect Chandrasekhar-Fermi method works in\nestimating magnetic field strengths. In order study this question, Ostriker et al. (2001),\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nPadoan et al. (2001), and Heitsch et al. (2001) simulated magnetized molecular regions and\n\"observed\" those simulations in order to compute dust polarization images. They then compared Bpos inferred from the \"observed\" dispersions in polarization position angles with the\nknown magnetic field strengths. With no smoothing of the simulations and relatively strong\nfield strengths, such that \u03b4\u03c6 < 25\u25e6 , Ostriker et al. (2001) found Q \u2248 0.46 \u2212 0.51, while\nPadoan et al. (2001) and Heitsch et al. (2001) found Q \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.4. The three studies concluded that the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method would yield reliable values of Bpos for regions\nof strong fields (such as molecular clouds) so long as the Q correction was applied. Heitsch\net al. (2001) then investigated the result of inadequate spatial resolution in observations by\nsmoothing their simulated polarization images and inferring Q; with the maximum smoothing considered, Q \u2248 0.1; i.e., a severe overestimation of Bpos . However, the simulations did\nnot have sufficient resolution to resolve dense cores sufficiently such that smoothing studies\nfor the dense cores could be reliably carried out (Heitsch 2003). The Heitsch et al. (2001)\nsimulations that were used for the resolution studies only had 1283 computational cells.\nHigh-density filaments and cores within those filaments typically had only a small number\nof computational pixels across them. As stated by Heitsch et al. (2001), \"our simulations\nrefer to a whole molecular cloud region comprising dense filaments and cores as well as the\ndilute gas.\" Self-gravitating cores are not properly resolved in the simulations, and indeed\nthe simulations were halted when dense filaments formed due to insufficient resolution to\nfollow the evolution further. Hence, the unsmoothed simulations \u2013 particularly the higher\nresolution (2563 ) ones of Ostriker et al. (2001) best represent the data reported here. We\ntherefore adopt their value Q = 0.5 in Equation 2.\nThe uncertainty in values of Bpos determined from equation (2) may be estimated knowing the uncertainties in the quantities on the right side of the equation. First considering\nonly the observational uncertainties, the error is dominated by uncertainties in n(H2 ). Both\n\u2206V and \u03b4\u03c6 are generally known within \u223c 10%, but the uncertainty in n(H2 ) may be as\nmuch as a factor of two, mitigated by the fact that n(H2 ) enters only as the square root.\nAdopting these uncertainties, the uncertainty \u03c3(B) in Bpos is \u03c3(B)/Bpos \u2248 0.5. Systematic\nuncertainties may be parameterized by the uncertainty in Q. Equation (2) requires the velocity dispersion in the plane of the sky, yet what is available observationally is the velocity\ndispersion along the line of sight; the assumption is made that (at least statistically) turbulent velocities are isotropic. Q includes a mean correction for the fact that several turbulent\ncells or MHD wavelengths will be averaged through the cloud, reducing \u03b4\u03c6. Moreover, if\nthe angular resolution of the observations is insufficient to resolve MHD wavelengths, there\nwill be spatial smoothing in the plane of the sky. On the other hand, large-scale structure\nin the regular field that is not subtracted out before \u03b4\u03c6 is calculated from the polarization\nposition angles will increase the measured \u03b4\u03c6. The simulations discussed above suggest that\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe uncertainty in Q may be less than \u223c 30%. For example, Ostriker et al. (2001) found Q\nin the range 0.46 - 0.51 when \u03b4\u03c6 < 25\u25e6 , which is certainly the case for the three cores considered in this paper, and concluded that \"...the Chandrasekhar-Fermi formula multiplied\nby a factor 0.5 yields a good estimate of the plane-of sky magnetic field strength, provided\nthe dispersion in polarization angles is < 25\u25e6 ...\". Including a 30% uncertainty in Q gives\n\u03c3(B)/Bpos \u2248 0.6.\nAlso, this method gives only two of the three components of B; the line-of-sight component is not constrained. Since Bpos = Btotal sin \u03b8, the statistical average value of B pos\nis\nZ \u03c0/2\n\u03c0\n(3)\nB pos =\n[|B| sin \u03b8] sin \u03b8d\u03b8 = |B|.\n4\n0\nAlthough there is not a large underestimate in the total B in using only the values of Bpos ,\nthere can be a large geometrical bias in the directly inferred values of \u03bb. If B is strong,\nclouds will have an oblate spheroid or disk morphology, with B along the minor axis. To\nproperly measure \u03bb, one needs B and N along a flux tube, i.e., parallel to the minor axis.\nBut in general N (and M) will be overestimated by 1/ cos \u03b8 if the sight line has an angle \u03b8\nto the minor axis, while |B| (and \u03a6) is underestimated by sin \u03b8. Again statistically,\nM/\u03a6 =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nM cos \u03b8\n1\nsin \u03b8d\u03b8 = (M/\u03a6)obs .\n\u03a6/ sin \u03b8\n3\n\n(4)\n\nThus, mapping of dust polarization provides a new technique for estimating magnetic\nfield strengths and hence \u03bb. In this paper we report on new SCUBA polarimeter observations\nof the L183 prestellar core and the analysis of these and previously published observations\nof the L1544 and L43 prestellar cores (Ward-Thompson et al. 2000) to infer the strength of\nthe magnetic fields in these cores. We then find \u03bb for the three prestellar cores and discuss\nthe results.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nSubmillimetre continuum polarimetry observations at \u03bb850 \u03bcm were carried out using\nthe SCUBA (Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array) camera on the James Clerk\nMaxwell Telescope (JCMT5 ) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, on the mornings of 1999 March 15 and\n5\n\nJCMT is operated by the Joint Astronomy Center, Hawaii, on behalf of the UK PPARC, the Netherlands\nNWO, and the Canadian NRC. SCUBA was built at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. SCUBAPOL was\nbuilt at Queen Mary & Westfield College, London.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nSeptember 15, as well as 2002 February 15 through 17 from HST 01:30 to 09:30 (UT 11:30 to\n19:30). Pointing and focussing were checked using the bright sources Uranus, 1514-240 and\nIRAS16293, and the pointing was found to be good to \u223c1\u20132\u2032\u2032 throughout. All three cores\nwere observed in 1999; in 2002 only L183 was observed.\nSCUBA (Holland et al. 1999) was used in conjunction with the polarimeter SCUBAPOL\n(Greaves et al. 2000) in the 16-position jiggling mode to produce a fully sampled 2.3\u2032 image\n(Holland et al. 1999). The observations were carried out while using the secondary mirror to\nchop 120\u2032\u2032 in azimuth at around 7 Hz and synchronously to detect the signal, thus rejecting\n\"sky\" emission. The method of observing used was to make a full 16-point jiggle map (to\nproduce a Nyquist sampled map), with an integration time of 1 second per point, in each of\nthe \"left\" and \"right\" beams of the telescope (the two beams are produced by the chopping\nsecondary mirror).\nThis process was repeated at each position of the polarimeter half-wave plate. Then the\nhalf-wave plate was rotated to the next position, in steps of 22.5\u25e6 . 16 such positions thus\nconstitute a complete revolution of the half-wave plate, representing 512 seconds of on-source\nintegration, which took about 12 minutes, including overheads (Greaves 1999; Greaves et al.\n2000). This was then repeated several times, the data stacked and a sinusoidal curve was\nfitted to the data to calculate the magnitude and direction of the polarization.\nThe instrumental polarization of each bolometer was measured on the planets Uranus\nand Saturn and subtracted from the data before calculating the true source polarization.\nThe mean instrumental polarization was found to be 0.93\u00b10.27%. The observations were\nrepeated with a slight offset in each case (caused by sky rotation) so that any individual\nbolometers with significantly above average noise could be removed without leaving areas of\nthe map with no data. The atmospheric opacity at 225 GHz was monitored by the radiometer\nlocated at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. The opacity at 225 GHz was 0.06\u20130.07\nduring the 1999 observations, and 0.04\u20130.07 during the 2002 observations, typical of good\nconditions at the site.\nEach individual night was seen to be stable within itself, which is important for the\npolarimetry measurements. The data from each night were reduced separately and found\nto produce consistent results. Data from all nights were then co-added to produce a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio final map. We have previously published the data from the 1999 observing run (Ward-Thompson et al. 2000). The data we publish herein are consistent with the\nprevious paper, but have a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and hence more polarization vectors\nat lower intensity levels.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 1 shows our map for the prestellar core L183. Intensities are shown as a grey-scale\nimage with contours overlaid; the vectors represent the polarized intensity (PI) measured at\neach position. They have been rotated by 90\u25e6 to show the inferred direction of the magnetic\nfield. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for the map of PI, it was smoothed from\nthe telescope resolution of 14\u2032\u2032 to 21\u2032\u2032 resolution; the intensity map was not smoothed. The\ntypical PI sensitivity is sp \u2248 2 mJy beam\u22121 , although it varies from \u223c 1.5 mJy beam\u22121\nnear the intensity peak to \u223c 4 mJy beam\u22121 in the low intensity regions. This variation is\nmainly due to the fact that at positions with low total intensity the fitting process (\u00a72) is\nmore affected by atmospheric instabilities than it is at high intensity positions.\nOur goal is to infer magnetic field strengths and mass-to-magnetic flux ratios from equations (1) and (2). For this we need estimates of the dispersion in polarization position angles,\nvolume density, column density, and velocity dispersion for the same region of each core. In\neach subsection below we discuss details of the measurements of the needed parameters. We\nfirst discuss here factors common to all three cores.\nFor each position at which we have a significant polarization measurement (P I/sp > 2),\nwe have the Stokes Q and U values and their associated measurement uncertainties. From\nthese we compute the position angle \u03c6 and its measurement uncertainty s\u03c6 for each position.\nWe weight each measurement by s\u22122\n\u03c6 and compute the weighted mean position angle \u03c6 for\neach core. In the absence of measurement uncertainty, the deviation of each measured \u03c6\nfrom \u03c6 would be due to the random magnetic field component at that position; we compute\nthe dispersion in position angles \u03b4\u03c6 from these deviations, with each \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304 weighted by\ns\u22122\n\u03c6 . From the measurement uncertainties s\u03c6 we also estimate \u03c3\u03c6 , the dispersion in the\nposition angles expected just from measurement uncertainty with no intrinsic scatter in\nposition angles. In the absence of any random component of the magnetic field, \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c3\u03c6 .\nWe find that typically \u03b4\u03c6 \u2248 3\u03c3\u03c6 , which means that we have measured a random magnetic\nfield. We correct the upward bias of \u03b4\u03c6 due to \u03c3\u03c6 (such that \u03b4\u03c62actual = \u03b4\u03c62meas \u2212 \u03c3\u03c62 ) and\nuse this corrected \u03b4\u03c6 in equation (2). It should be noted that the ratio \u03b4\u03c6/\u03c3\u03c6 is not a\nmeasure of the uncertainty in our determination of \u03b4\u03c6. \u03c3\u03c6 represents the mean error of a\nsingle measurement of position angle, not the mean error in the determination of \u03b4\u03c6 from\nmeasurements at multiple positions.\nFrom SCUBA \u03bb850 \u03bcm maps of a number of cores, including the three discussed in this\npaper, Kirk (2003) and Kirk et al. (2003) have inferred the core masses. Our estimate of\nthe field strength in each core will apply to the region over which we map the polarization;\nwe therefore use mean values for parameters needed in equations (1) and (2) appropriate to\nthe area of the polarization measurements. For L1544 and L43 the polarization detections\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nare confined to positions with intensities of about half the peak intensity or higher, so\nwe use the inferred mass within the half-power intensity contour. However, for L183 our\npolarization map covers an area significantly larger than the half-power contour. Although\nthere are four measurements outside the 100 mJy beam\u22121 contour, almost all measurements\nare within this intensity contour. We therefore use the mass within this contour to infer\nneeded parameters. With the approximation that the mean radius r\u0304 is the geometric mean\nof the major and minor axes of the selected intensity contour, we estimate N(H2 ) \u2248 M/\u03c0r\u0304 2 m\nand n(H2 ) \u2248 3M/4\u03c0r\u0304 3 m from the SCUBA masses and mean radii; we use the distances to\neach core from Kirk (2003) and Kirk et al. (2003).\nWe use measurements of the N2 H+ (1-0) line (Caselli et al. 2002) to obtain \u2206V . There\nare several reasons to support this being the best available choice. The excitation of the\nN2 H+ (1-0) line suggests that it traces high-density material similar to that traced by the\ndust emission. The Caselli et al. (2002) spectral-line maps of L183, L1544, and L43 agree\nwell with the SCUBA dust maps, except that the deconvolved (corrected for telescope beam\nbroadening) sizes of the cores in N2 H+ are about 50% larger than in dust emission sizes. This\nof course suggests that N2 H+ samples on average a slightly lower density region than does\nthe \u03bb850 \u03bcm dust emission. In each subsection below we compare n(H2 ) inferred from N2 H+\nexcitation with values from dust emission for each core. The expectation that N2 H+ indeed\nsamples a slightly lower density is borne out by these comparisons; we use the densities\ninferred from the dust emission results in equation (2). However, we need estimates of the\nvelocity dispersions from spectral-line data. We use the values of \u2206V (N2 H+ ) at each peak\nposition as the best available value. Use of the peak value rather than a value averaged over\na larger region perhaps compensates for the fact that N2 H+ samples slightly lower densities.\nMoreover, although there is some structure in \u2206V (N2 H+ ) shown in the maps of Caselli et\nal. (2002), over the roughly 2\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 area of each of our three cores this variation is small. In\naddition to the single-dish data, we make use of the high-resolution BIMA maps of L1544\nin the N2 H+ (1-0) line (Williams et al. 1999). Finally, since we need the turbulent velocity\ndispersion in equation (2), we correct each total N2 H+ line width for the (small) thermal\ncontribution to the line width (with TK = 10 K) and use \u2206VN T in equation (2).\nTable 1 lists the relevant data and the results, where D is the distance of each core, r\u0304 is\nthe mean core radius on the plane of the sky (the half-power radius except for L183), \u2206VN T\nis the turbulent FWHM line width, Mdust is the total (gas and dust) core mass inferred from\nthe dust emission within the \u03bb850 \u03bcm dust emission contour selected for each core, N(H2 )\nand n(H2 ) are the mean column and volume densities inferred from Mdust and r\u0304, \u03b4\u03c6 is the\ncorrected polarization position angle dispersion, Bpos is the field strength in the plane of\nthe sky, \u03bbobs is the observed mass-to-magnetic flux ratio in units of the critical ratio, \u03bbcor\nis \u03bbobs corrected by 1/3 from equation (4), MBcrit is the magnetic critical mass that can\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nbe supported by our measured B, and Mvir is the virial mass (e.g., (Caselli et al. 2002)),\ncomputed for TK = 10 K and the r\u0304 and \u2206VN T listed in the table. In each subsection below,\nwe discuss each core separately.\n\n3.1.\n\nL183\n\nThe L183 core (Figure 1) is only slightly elongated at the JCMT resolution, with a\nposition angle of \u223c \u221215\u25e6 ; this core is embedded in a filament-like structure extending further\nnorth and south than our SCUBA map. The filament has approximately the same position\nangle south of the core as does the core itself, but north of the core it is nearly north-south.\nOn the eastern side of the filament, polarization is detected at a threshold total intensity\nlevel of about the 60 mJy beam\u22121 . On the western side the polarization detection threshold\nis about a factor of two higher.\nThere are 25 independent positions from which the mean polarization position angle and\nthe dispersion about that mean in the position angles may be calculated. The signal-to-noise\nweighted mean position angle is \u03c6\u0304 = 28\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 . The signal-to-noise weighted dispersion is\n\u03b4\u03c6 = 15\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , while the contribution to \u03b4\u03c6 due to measurement uncertainty is 6\u25e6 . Corrected\nfor the measurement uncertainty contribution, \u03b4\u03c6 = 14\u25e6 .\nHowever, one must examine the possibility that there is a contribution to this dispersion\ndue to a large-scale change in the field direction over the core. If one ignored this, the\ncalculated dispersion would be too large, and equation (2) would underestimate Bpos . To\ncheck for a variation in the mean field direction due to the bend in the filament, we computed\nthe mean position angle north (\u03c6\u0304N ) and south (\u03c6\u0304S ) of \u03b4 = \u22122\u25e6 44\u2032 , the declination of the\nbend. Results were \u03c6\u0304N = 29\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 and \u03c6\u0304S = 25\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 ; therefore, there is no significant\nsystematic change in the mean field direction due to the bend in the filament. The position\nangles do appear to be more random in the south than the north, however; \u03b4\u03c6N = 11\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6\nwhile \u03b4\u03c6S = 17\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 . One possible explanation is that there is a south-to-north gradient in\nBpos . However, a gradient in n(H2 ) and/or \u03b4V and a constant Bpos would produce the same\neffect. There is no gradient observed in \u2206V (see Caselli et al. (2002) Figure 8) across the\ncore. We can also carry out this experiment by dividing the data into east and west regions.\nWe computed the mean position angle east (\u03c6\u0304E ) and west (\u03c6\u0304W ) of \u03b1 = 15h 51m 32s . Results\nwere \u03c6\u0304E = 31\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 and \u03c6\u0304W = 19\u25e6 \u00b1 4\u25e6 ; therefore, there may be a small difference in the\nmean field direction east and west of the core. However, this does not significantly affect\nthe dispersion in position angles. Computing the position angle dispersions separately in the\ntwo regions yields \u03b4\u03c6E = 14\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 and \u03b4\u03c6W = 14\u25e6 \u00b1 4\u25e6 ; therefore, there is little change from\nthe result (\u03b4\u03c6 = 15\u25e6 ) obtained above assuming that the mean field is uniform in direction\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nover the entire core.\nIt seems clear that the polarization data do not sample the innermost core region, for\nthere is depolarization toward the inner core (r < 15\u2032\u2032 from the peak intensity position)\nin comparison with the envelope of the core. Such polarization \"holes\" are common (but\nnot ubiquitous). Matthews et al. (2001) argued that such depolarization seen in the OMC3\nmolecular filament was due to geometry \u2013 the effect of a projected helical magnetic field.\nHowever, the depolarization toward L183 is not seen along the filament as was the case\ntoward OMC3, but rather is confined to the inner core. Depolarization is also seen quite\nstrongly in dense cores mapped interferometrically (e.g., Lai et al. (2002)). A possible explanation is a change in grain properties such that grains at high densities are not polarizing.\nPolarization maps usually present percentage polarization rather than the polarized intensity, PI. In Figure 1 we have plotted PI in order to show that it is not just the case that the\npercentage polarization decreases in the inner core, but that the PI itself is weaker toward\nthe core. PI is fairly uniform across the source outside of the inner core. The polarization\n\"hole\" (or conversely, polarization limb brightening) suggests that the polarization arises\npredominantly in an envelope or shell region. Toward the center positions the shorter line\nof sight through the envelope, with the inner core itself producing no polarization, could\nexplain the observations.\nWe measure polarization at almost all positions within the 100 mJy beam\u22121 contour (and\na few postions to the southeast outside this contour). We therefore apply the ChandrasekharFermi relation over the region within the 100 mJy beam\u22121 contour. From the SCUBA data\nwe infer a mass within the 100 mJy beam\u22121 contour to be 1.0 M\u2299 and r\u0304 \u2248 0.023 pc, which\nyield a mean density n\u0304(H2 ) \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . If we assume that the inner core does not\ncontribute to the polarization, we must exclude its contribution to the mass. The SCUBA\ndata yield a mass of 0.24 M\u2299 within the cylinder with a radius of 15\u2032\u2032 (0.008 pc) centered\non the peak position. Subtracting this mass and the volume of the cylinder from the total\nmass and volume, we find n\u0304(H2 ) \u2248 2.6 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . Hence, the assumption that polarization\ndoes not sample the inner core makes little difference in the estimate of n\u0304(H2 ) and hence of\nthe magnetic field strength. We find N(H2 ) \u2248 2.7 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 for the envelope region.\nWe use the lower n(H2 ) density appropriate to the envelope, but note that a two-level\nexcitation analysis of the N2 H+ (1-0) line Caselli et al. (2002) found n\u0304(H2 ) \u2248 0.8 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 .\nAs discussed above, the N2 H+ (1-0) line appears to sample slightly lower density than does\nthe dust emission.\nThe N2 H+ line width at the peak position is \u2206V = 0.25 km s\u22121 . Correcting for the\nthermal contribution, we have \u2206VN T = 0.22 km s\u22121 for the turbulent line width. Thus, with\nn(H2 ) = 2.6\u00d7105 cm\u22123 , \u2206V = 0.22 km s\u22121 , and \u03b4\u03c6 = 14\u25e6 , equation (2) yields Bpos \u2248 80 \u03bcG.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nCrutcher et al. (1993) carried out Zeeman observations in the 18-cm lines of OH toward\ndark clouds, including L183. They set a 3 \u2212 \u03c3 upper limit for the mean line-of-sight field\nstrength of Blos < 16 \u03bcG, which is much smaller than Bpos \u2248 80 \u03bcG inferred here. It is\npossible that B lies very nearly in the plane of the sky. However, a more likely explanation\nfor the difference is that the OH Zeeman observations did not sample the dust core. First,\nquasi-thermal OH emission almost certainly does not sample regions with n(H2 ) > 104 cm\u22123 .\nMoreover, the OH observations were carried out with an 18\u2032 beam, so that an area of sky\nabout two orders of magnitude larger was sampled for Blos than for Bpos . Indeed, the mean\n(over the 18\u2032 beam) n(H2 ) inferred from the OH data is n(H2 ) \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 , about\ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than the density in the core region sampled by the dust\n\u221a\nand N2 H+ line emission. For constant mass-to-magnetic flux ratio, B scales as \u03c1, so it is\nnot surprising that the upper limit on B inferred from the OH Zeeman data is significantly\nsmaller than B inferred from the dust polarimetry.\nFor N(H2 ) = 2.7 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and Bpos = 80 \u03bcG, we have \u03bb \u2248 2.6, or slightly supercritical. Hence, the regular magnetic field alone is not sufficient to support the core against\ngravity. Without support from other sources, the L183 core should be collapsing. In fact, in\na survey for infall motions, Lee et al. (2001) found that L183 showed infall motions, consistent with collapse. However, if we apply the statistical correction factor from equation (4),\n\u03bbcor \u2248 0.9.\n3.2.\n\nL1544\n\nNo new SCUBA data for L1544 were obtained; here we analyze the data of WardThompson et al. (2000) \u2013 see their Figure 1. Toward L1544 there were only 9 independent\npositions where polarization was measured. All positions were within the 60% of peak\ncontour. Although the percentage polarization inside the 80% of peak contour was lower\nthan at positions farther from the center, there were no significant polarization detections\nsouth of the core. Hence, the strength of the polarization appears to decrease from north\nto south without a clear inner core depolarization. The signal-to-noise weighted dispersion\nin the polarization position angles is \u03b4\u03c6 = 15\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , while the contribution to \u03b4\u03c6 due to\nmeasurement uncertainty is 6\u25e6 . Corrected for the measurement contribution, \u03b4\u03c6 = 13\u25e6 .\nFrom the SCUBA data we infer the mean density within the half-power contour n\u0304(H2 ) \u2248\n4.9 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . From an excitation analysis of the N2 H+ (1-0) line Caselli et al. (2002) find\nn\u0304(H2 ) \u2248 0.7 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , which is significantly smaller than the SCUBA value. Although\nwe noted above that the N2 H+ (1-0) line appears to sample lower densities than the dust\nemission, there may be another reason for this rather large difference in L1544. Tafalla et al.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n(1998) and Williams et al. (1999) studied L1544 in detail and suggested that the observed\nredshifted self-absorption in spectral lines implied that L1544 has a low-density envelope\nwith infall onto a high-density core. Williams et al. (1999) observed the N2 H+ (1-0) line at\nhigh angular resolution with BIMA and carried out a detailed analysis. Their model has\ntwo components, a foreground low density region with n(H2 )peak \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 and a\nbackground dense region with n(H2 )peak \u2248 4 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . The single-dish observations of\nCaselli et al. (2002) were analyzed with only a single component, and they found a density\nintermediate between those of the two density components. The dust emission mapped with\nSCUBA is optically thin and requires a large column density for detection; it would not be\nsensitive to a low-density foreground envelope. Hence, the density of the core inferred from\nthe BIMA data and from the SCUBA data agree rather well. We use the density inferred\nfrom the SCUBA data.\nThe N2 H+ line width at the peak position is \u2206V = 0.31 km s\u22121 . Correcting for the\nthermal contribution, we have \u2206VN T = 0.28 km s\u22121 for the turbulent line width. Thus,\nfor n(H2 ) = 4.9 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , \u2206VN T = 0.28 km s\u22121 , and \u03b4\u03c6 = 13\u25e6 , equation (2) yields\nBpos \u2248 140 \u03bcG.\nCrutcher & Troland (2000) detected the Zeeman effect in the 18-cm lines of OH with the\nArecibo telescope and inferred Blos \u2248 11 \u03bcG, a much smaller value than our estimate here of\nthe field strength in the plane of the sky. However, Crutcher & Troland (2000) argued that\nthe OH data did not sample the small dense core observed in \u03bb850 \u03bcm dust emission. Part\nof the problem is that the 3\u2032 angular resolution of the Arecibo telescope is about 5 times\nthe area of the SCUBA dust core. Probably more importantly, Crutcher & Troland (2000)\nargued that OH and the C18 O (1-0) lines sample the same gas, and higher angular resolution\n(46\u2032\u2032 ) C18 O (1-0) maps (Tafalla et al. 1998) show no evidence for the small, dense dust core.\nRather, the C18 O (and OH) lines seem to sample a lower density envelope region, perhaps\nthe foreground component with n(H2 ) \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 discussed by Williams et al. (1999).\n\u221a\nThe flux-freezing scaling B \u221d \u03c1 would account for the difference in Bpos and Blos without\nrequiring that the field be mainly in the plane of the sky.\nFor N(H2 ) = 4.2\u00d71022 cm\u22122 and B = 140 \u03bcG, we have \u03bb \u2248 2.3, or slightly supercritical.\nHence, the regular magnetic field alone is insufficient to support the core against gravity.\nThis result would be consistent with the previous claims that L1544 is infalling (collapsing).\nAgain, however, application of the possible geometrical correction from equation (4) would\nyield \u03bbcor \u2248 0.8.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nL43\n\nFor L43 no new SCUBA data were obtained either, and we analyze the data of WardThompson et al. (2000) \u2013 see their Figure 3. Toward L43 there were 31 independent positions\nwhere the position angle of the polarization was measured. However, L43 is a considerably\nmore complicated cloud than the other two. The prestellar core we are interested in is\nnot isolated; there is a second core at the western edge of the SCUBA field of view (WardThompson et al. 2000) in which a classical T Tauri star, RNO 91 (Cohen 1980), is embedded.\nThe outflow from RNO 91 has cleared a cavity to the south of the source and the southern\nedge of the prestellar core forms part of the cavity wall. The direction of the SCUBA\npolarization vectors from the center of the prestellar core to the north do not appear to have\nbeen affected by the cavity. However, to the south and west the position angles are distinctly\ndifferent, with the magnetic field turning smoothly through an angle of roughly 90\u25e6 from the\nprestellar core position to the RNO 91 position. A blind calculation of the dispersion of the\nposition angles over the entire field would include a very significant contribution from this\nstructure in the regular field. Because we are interested in the field in the prestellar core,\nwe use only those positions on and north of the core that appear to be unaffected by RNO\n91; specifically, those north of \u03b4(1950) = \u221215\u25e6 41\u2032 and east of \u03b1(1950) = 16h 31m 42s . This\nleaves 11 positions that sample the magnetic field in the L43 prestellar core. All positions are\nwithin the 50% of peak contour. The strength of the polarization appears to decrease from\nwest to east with only a weak inner core central depolarization. The signal-to-noise weighted\ndispersion in the polarization position angles for the 11 core positions is \u03b4\u03c6 = 13\u25e6 \u00b1 1\u25e6 , while\nthe contribution to \u03b4\u03c6 due to measurement uncertainty is 4\u25e6 . Corrected for the measurement\ncontribution, \u03b4\u03c6 = 12\u25e6 .\nFrom the SCUBA data we infer the mean density within the half-power contour n\u0304(H2 ) \u2248\n3.8 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 . From an excitation analysis of the N2 H+ (1-0) line Caselli et al. (2002) find\nn\u0304(H2 ) \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , which agrees well with the SCUBA result, especially considering\nthe evidence discussed above that the N2 H+ (1-0) line may sample slightly lower densities\nthan the dust emission. Their N2 H+ (1-0) line width is \u2206V = 0.36 km s\u22121 . Correcting for\nthe thermal contribution, we have \u2206VN T = 0.34 km s\u22121 for the turbulent line width. For\nn(H2 ) = 3.8 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , \u2206VN T = 0.34 km s\u22121 , and \u03b4\u03c6 = 12\u25e6 , equation (2) yields Bpos \u2248 160\n\u03bcG. There are no Zeeman data on the line-of-sight component of the field toward L43.\nFor N(H2 ) = 3.9\u00d71022 cm\u22122 and B = 160 \u03bcG, we have \u03bb \u2248 1.9, or slightly supercritical.\nHence, as for the other two cores, the regular magnetic field alone is insufficient to support\nthe core against gravity. There are no data available to address whether or not infall motions\nare seen toward the L43 prestellar core, but it is a part of a cloud in which a T Tauri star has\nformed nearby. The possible geometrical correction from equation (4) would yield \u03bbcor \u2248 0.6.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have applied the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to estimate magnetic field strengths\nin the plane of the sky in three dense, prestellar cores. Our major result inferred directly\nfrom the observations is that for all three cores the inferred mass-to-magnetic flux ratios are\nsupercritical by approximately a factor of two, or \u03bb \u2248 2. Said another way, the mass that\ncan be supported by the measured plane-of-sky field, MBcrit , is about 1/2 the actual mass,\nMdust , inferred from the intensity of the dust emission. Hence, the ordered magnetic fields\nin these cores are insufficient to support the cores against gravitational collapse.\nHowever, cores which are supported by magnetic fields would have a disk morphology\nwith the field along the minor axis. In the extreme case of plane-parallel disk geometry, the\nstatistical mean correction would be \u03bbcor = 13 \u03bbobs . Although this correction is a statistical one\nthat is only valid when considering the mean value of \u03bb for a large number of observations,\napplying it to the three cores discussed here changes the formal results such that \u03bbcor is\ncritical to slightly subcritical. But of course, the uncertainties in inferring \u03bb are such that it\nis not possible to say whether \u03bb in these cores is slightly subcritical or slightly supercritical.\nSurprisingly, the virial masses are essentially equal to the observed dust masses. The\nfact that Mvir \u2248 Mdust suggests that the cores are supported by turbulent and thermal\nmotions (mainly thermal, since \u2206Vth = 0.44 km s\u22121 for a mean particle mass of 2.33mH and\nT = 10 K). However, for L183 and L1544 infall motions have been inferred from self-absorbed\nmolecular line profiles, suggesting collapse; data on possible infall are not yet available for\nL43. It seems likely that the virial masses are overestimated. Caselli et al. (2002) found a\nsimilar inconsistency in their data; all their cores with Mvir < 2.5M\u2299 have Mvir \u2248 2Mex ,\nwhere Mex was calculated with the density inferred from collisional excitation of the N2 H+\nline.\nThere are several factors that would lead to virial masses being overestimated. First,\nvirial masses are based on a crude model \u2013 a uniform density sphere. Caselli et al. (2002)\npointed out that a cloud model with a centrally peaked density distribution with \u03c1 \u221d r \u22122\nwould change the virial formula such that Mvir would be reduced by a factor of 1.6. The radial\ndensity profiles of starless cores are observed to be centrally peaked, based on analysis of the\ndata with isothermal models. However, the central peaking may be even more pronounced\nthan the isothermal models imply. Modelling of dust emission observations have led to\nevidence for temperature decreasing inward ((Zucconi et al. 2001) and (Evans et al. 2001).\nSince the intensity of the dust emission is approximately proportional to the product of\nthe column density and the temperature, an outward temperature gradient would require\na more peaked density distribution to fit the observations than the isothermal fits have\nyielded. In addition, kinetic temperatures within the core radii over which polarization is\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nmeasured would be smaller than the mean; so the \u2206Vth used in the virial mass equation\nwould be lowered, further reducing the virial mass. Hence, the inconsistency would be\nresolved, and the virial masses would be significantly below the observed masses. With\nMBcrit + Mvir < Mdust , collapse would be possible. These changes would also affect the Bpos\nand \u03bb that we infer, but insufficiently detailed information on temperatures is available to\njustify trying to take this into account at this time.\nCan our results help distinguish between the ambipolar-diffusion and turbulence driven\nmodels of star formation? The magnetically supported model of star formation does make\na specific prediction. For an initially subcritical cloud, ambipolar diffusion increases the\nmass-to-flux ratio in the core until the core becomes supercritical. In a typical model, after\nthe central density \u03c1c has increased by \u223c 101.5 from its initial value \u03c10 and the core becomes\nmagnetically critical, the mass-to-flux ratio in the core will slowly increase from \u03bb = 1 to\n\u03bb \u2248 3 as \u03c1c /\u03c10 increases to 106 (e.g., Ciolek & Mouschovias (1994), Figure 4). Hence, in\nspite of the uncertainties in inferring \u03bb, this prediction appears to be well satisfied by our\ndata.\nHowever, in spite of the fact that the observations satisfy the ambipolar-diffusion driven\nprediction, this does not rule out turbulence-driven star formation. The turbulence models\ndo not make a specific prediction, except of course that \u03bb > 1. If \u03bb \u223c 2 in the general,\nturbulent interstellar medium, those values of \u03bb would persist when cores were formed by\nturbulence, so long as flux freezing held. Hence, while the result \u03bb \u2248 2 is suggestive, it is\nnot definitive. While measurements of \u03bb could rule out a dominant role for magnetic fields\nif \u03bb >> 1 were found in cores, they could only rule out a dominant role for turbulence if\nsubcritical mass-to-flux ratios were observed at earlier stages of cloud evolution, before dense\ncores formed.\nThis analysis has shown that dust polarization mapping of dense prestellar cores can\nprovide information about magnetic field strengths. Especially in the absence of Zeeman observations that sample these dense regions, this technique adds significantly to our extremely\nsparse knowledge about the role of magnetic fields in the star formation process.\nThis work was partially supported by NSF grant AST 02-05810.
