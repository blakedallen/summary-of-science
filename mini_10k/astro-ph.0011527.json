These bodies are believed to be icy planetesimals remaining from the time preceding planet formation, as predicted by\nEdgeworth (1949) and Kuiper (1951). As of mid-2000, over 300 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)\nare known (Marsden 2000), most having faint magnitudes (20 < mR < 28) owing to their detection\nin narrow-field surveys with large-aperture telescopes. Physical studies have been limited to broadband filter photometry for the fainter bodies and spectroscopy for a few of the brighter objects.\nThese studies show that TNOs are spectrally diverse, with colors ranging from neutral to extremely\nred (Luu & Jewitt 1996; Tegler & Romanishin 1998; Jewitt & Luu 1998; Noll, Luu, & Gilmore 2000;\nBarucci et al. 2000) and with absorption features indicative of hydrocarbons and water ice (Brown\net al. 1997; Brown, Cruikshank, & Pendleton 1999). Previous analyses of the discovery data have\nshown that the number brighter than mR increases as 10\u03b1mR , with \u03b1 ranging from 0.52 \u00b1 0.02 to\n0.76\u00b10.10 (Jewitt, Luu & Trujillo 1998; Gladman et al. 1998; Chiang & Brown 1999) depending on\nthe choice and interpretation of discovery data. It is not known if this luminosity function extends\nto magnitudes as bright as Pluto (mV = 14) or instead cuts off at intermediate magnitudes. Such\na cutoff might reveal a termination in the growth phase of the TNOs at the time of Neptune's\nformation (Bailey 1993; Stern & Colwell 1997).\nHere we describe the discovery circumstances and photometric properties of 2000 EB173, now\none of the brightest TNOs with opposition magnitude mR = 18.9 and also one of the largest Plutinos\n(a TNO with a stable orbit like Pluto completing two orbits for every three by Neptune, thereby\navoiding close encounters with Neptune). We show that this detection would not be likely unless\nthe luminosity function continues with a shallow slope (\u03b1 \u223c 0.5) at bright magnitudes, mR < 19.\nWe also show that the object's photometric properties are similar to those of fainter TNOs with\nred color.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe discovered 2000 EB173 in a computer-aided search through digital images, all recorded\nin a single 6-hour period on the night of 2000 March 15, using the 1-m Schmidt telescope at\nLlano del Hato, Venezuela. Our collaboration, known as the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team\n(QUEST), has designed and constructed for this telescope a digital camera consisting of a 4 x 4\nmosaic of charge-coupled devices (CCDs), each with 2048 x 2048 15-micron pixels (Snyder 1998).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe system is designed for drift-scanning. With the telescope position fixed, we align the parallel\nclocking direction of the CCDs with the East-West motion of the drifting sky image. By clocking\neach CCD to match the drift rate, we continuously scan 16 separate images. Each scan is 0.588\ndeg wide in Declination (Dec) and a variable width in Right Ascension (RA) that depends on the\nduration of the scan (up to 165 deg on long clear nights). Because the columns in our 4 x 4 mosaic\nrun East-West, each column yields 4 scans of the same sky area separated in time by 3.8 minutes\n(the drift time between CCDs). By providing each North-South row in the mosaic with a separate\nwide-band filter (Johnson U, B, V, or R), each CCD in a column scans the sky through a different\nband-pass.\nNormally, we use this instrument to search for quasars, supernovae, and other variable objects\nby repeatedly scanning the same area on a nightly basis. To conduct our TNO search, however,\nwe limited the search to an area 28.3 deg wide in RA (centered at RA = 13.249 hours, Dec =\n-1.08 deg), and scanned the area twice in one night with a separation of 3.99 hours. The total area\ncovered was 66.8 deg2 , imaged four times per scan through the filter sequence V, R1, B, R2. Later,\nwe processed the data by co-adding the two R and one V image from each scan sequence. We\nthen subtracted a scaled reference image created from co-added scans of the same area recorded\non previous nights. This removed images of stationary and non-varying stars and galaxies, leaving\nonly images of transient objects, asteroids, and noise artifacts.\nWe then used a computer program to identify objects with integrated intensities in R1+R2+V\ngreater than 3.0 times the noise in the sky background. By combining the set of objects identified in\nboth scan sequences and displaying their images on a computer monitor, possible TNOs appeared as\npairs of images. The following constraints were then applied to each object pair: to show retrograde\nmotion; to move within \u00b125 deg of the ecliptic; to have a separation of 5 to 20 arcseconds (the\nexpected displacement in 3.99 hours of a TNO observed near opposition); to reveal the same\napproximate magnitude in the 3.99-hour interval; to exhibit a FWHM consistent with surrounding\nstars; and to be detected in the separate R1, R2, and V images before co-addition (6 independent\nobservations). The only candidate (out of 600,000) to meet all these requirements was 2000 EB173.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nEfficiency. We estimated the limiting magnitude of our search by identifying main-belt asteroids appearing in a single scan sequence taken near opposition on an earlier night through the\nsame filter set. Given the 7.6-minute interval between successive R exposures in a single scan, the\nnear-opposition motion of main-belt asteroids is 4 to 6 pixels. We could therefore use the detection\nprocedure described above, but with the two R images replacing each of the two co-added R+R+V\nimages from the TNO scans.\nFigure 1 shows the number of main-belt asteroids we detect as a function of mR . Our relative\ndetection efficiency is the observed distribution divided by a power-law fit at bright magnitudes\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(Rabinowitz 1994). As shown in the figure, our 50% detection limit occurs at mR = 19.6 \u00b1 0.2.\nWe also determined that our absolute detection efficiency at bright magnitudes is close to 100% by\nverifying incidental detections of catalogued asteroids within the search fields.\nWe expect that our detection efficiency for TNOs has the same form as for main-belt asteroids,\nbut shifted to fainter magnitudes because we co-add two R images and one V image for each TNO\ndetection. This increases the relative signal from each TNO and from the sky by a factor of 2.6\u00b10.1,\nas verified from our measurements of 2000 EB173. The signal to noise ratio increases by the square\nroot of this factor since the noise at the detection limit is dominated by counting statistics of\nthe sky signal. Because we searched for TNOs and main-belt asteroids with the same threshold\nvalue of the signal to noise ratio, the limiting magnitude for our TNO search is fainter by a factor\n\u221a\n2.5 log( 2.6 \u00b1 0.1), yielding magnitude limit mR = 20.1 \u00b1 0.2.\nOrbit. Following the discovery of 2000 EB173, we confirmed its motion in QUEST scans from\nprevious nights. Based on an orbit solution from these initial observations we recovered the object\nthree months later with the 1-m Yale telescope at Cerro Tololo, Chile. Table 1 shows the most\nrecent orbital elements determined for 2000 EB173 from observations spanning 4 years (Marsden\nand Williams 2000a). These include pre-discovery, photographic observations with the 48\" Schmidt\ntelescope at Palomar, and post-discovery observations by amateur astronomers with telescopes of\nsub-meter aperture (Marsden and Williams 2000b). The eccentricity, e, and inclination, i, are\ntypical values for a Plutino (Jewitt & Luu 1996), while the semimajor axis, a, is relatively low.\nGiven the long arc of the observations, the orbit solution is accurate to better than 1%.\nSize. The absolute magnitude we determine, H = 4.7 \u00b1 0.1, is one of the brightest for any\nknown TNO, making 2000 EB173 also one of the largest TNOs assuming all have similar albedos.\nThe only brighter TNO is 1996 TO66 with H = 4.5 and the next brightest is 1999 TC36, a Plutino\nwith H = 4.8 (Marsden 2000). There are no known geometric albedos for TNOs, so one has to be\nassumed. For an albedo of 0.04, typical of dark, carbon-rich asteroids and cometary nuclei and a\nvalue commonly assumed for TNOs, the corresponding diameter would be \u223c 600 km, about 1/4\nthe size of Pluto (Jewitt, Luu & Trujillo 1998) and marginally resolvable with the Hubble Space\nTelescope.\nCumulative number. Figure 2 shows the number of TNOs per deg2 we find brighter than our\ndetection limit, plotted together with previous measurements at mostly fainter limits. Also shown\nare two previously suggested curves to fit the observations, \u03b1 = 0.58 \u00b1 0.05 from Jewitt, Luu &\nTrujillo (1998) and \u03b1 = 0.76 \u00b1 0.1 from Gladman et al. (1998). Our detection of 1 TNO per 66.8\ndeg2 favors the \u03b1 = 0.58 curve. It also rules out the previously established upper limit (Kowal 1989)\nof 1 TNO per 1000 deg2 brighter than mR = 19.5, as this would require an unrealistic, sharp cutoff\nin the magnitude frequency above mR = 20.1. Given previously predicted magnitude-frequency\ncurves that assume an upper limit to the diameter distribution of TNOs (Jewitt, Luu, & Trujillo\n1998), the likelihood of our discovery would be less than 10% for any diameter cutoff below 500\nkm.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nPhotometry and imaging. Following our discovery of 2000 EB173 we made photometric R-band\nobservations with the 1-m Yale telescope, BVRI observations with the 2.4-m Michigan-DartmouthMIT (MDM) telescope at Kitt Peak, and V and R observations with the 3.5-m Wisconsin-IndianaYale-NOAO (WIYN) telescope, also at Kitt Peak. Incidental, unfiltered CCD observations were\nalso made by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking Program (NEAT) of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nusing a U.S. Air Force 1.2-m telescope at Haleakala, Maui (these observations were identified using\nthe SkyMorph archive at http://skys.gsfc.nasa.gov/skymorph/skymorph.html).\nTable 2 lists the results from these observations and from pre-discovery QUEST scans. From\nMar 1 to Mar 15, and from June 3 to June 15, no variability in mR greater than 10% appears.\nFurthermore, a series of 9 images in V taken June 15 shows no variability greater than 3% over\na 1.25-hour period. Co-addition of the June 15 images reveals a stellar point-spread function for\n2000 EB173, with any cometary activity contributing less than 10% to the flux outside a radius of\n0.6 arcseconds. We are therefore confident that the colors we measure are unaffected by intrinsic\nvariability from rotation or cometary outbursts.\nColors. Figure 3 shows the spectral reflectance we derive for 2000 EB173 along with the\nmeasured reflectance for other TNOs (Jewitt & Luu 1998). Shortwards of 0.7 microns, the spectral\nslope we observe is consistent with that of other other TNOs. This result places the object among\na group with red colors identified previously by Tegler & Romanishin (1998). Longwards of 0.7\nmicrons, we observe a possible transition to a neutral reflectance, but this result is ambiguous.\nDepending on the pixel aperture we use for our photometry, we also obtain a red R \u2212 I color for\n2000 EB173, which would be expected based on previous observations of fainter red TNOs. In only\na few cases has such a flattening of the reflectance been observed (e.g., 1993 FW as observed by\nBarucci et al. 2000).\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\n1. The unusual brightness of 2000 EB173 provides an opportunity to study the physical nature\nof one TNO with substantially greater precision than has been possible previously. It now becomes\npossible for all astronomers, including those with modest facilities, to make a valuable contribution\nto the study of the primordial bodies preserved in the outer solar system. Possible contributions\nwould be to determine the size of 2000 EB173 by measuring the albedo with infrared observations or\nby direct observation with space-based telescopes. Such studies would have important implications\nfor the total mass of the TNO population, currently uncertain by more than an order of magnitude.\n2. We observe no variability in the lightcurve of 2000 EB173 and no cometary coma. The color\nis very red shortwards of 0.7 microns, typical of many fainter TNOs. Our measurements indicate a\npossible flattening of the reflectance longwards of 0.7 microns, but are also consistent with a redder\ncolor.\n3. Our detection of one TNO brighter than mR = 20.1 in a search of 66.8 deg2 favors the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nflat luminosity function (\u03b1 = 0.58) of Jewitt, Luu, & Trujillo (1998) over the steeper distribution\n(\u03b1 = 0.768) of Gladman et al. (1998).\n4. Extrapolating to a search of the entire area within 60 deg of the ecliptic (within the\ninclination range for TNOs determined by Jewitt, Luu, & Chen 1996), one could reasonably expect\nto find from one hundred to several hundred TNOs brighter than mR = 20.1. A dedicated search\nusing a telescope with capabilities similar to our own would discover most of these bodies in a few\nyears.\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
