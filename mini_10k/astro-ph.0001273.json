Except for a thin envelope of the star, due to Coulomb\ninteractions, nuclei form a bcc lattice neutralized by a roughly uniform sea of electrons.\nWith increasing density, weak interactions render nuclei neutron-rich via electron captures. Then, at a density of about \u223c 4 \u00d7 1011 g cm\u22123 , neutrons begin to drip out of these\nnuclei. The crystalline region of the star (not) including a gas of the dripped neutrons\nis usually referred to as an inner (outer) crust. In the deepest region of the inner crust,\ncorresponding to densities just below the normal saturation density \u03c1s \u223c 3 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 ,\nnot only are nuclei expected to have rod-like and slab-like shapes, but also the system is\nexpected to turn inside out in such a way that the constituents of the original nuclei form\na liquid containing rod-like and roughly spherical bubbles of the dripped neutrons. These\ntransformations, as originally indicated by Ravenhall et al. [2] and Hashimoto et al. [3],\nstem from a delicate competition between the nuclear surface and Coulomb energies at\nsmall internuclear spacings.\nRecent calculations of the ground state of matter in the crust, performed by using\nspecific nuclear models [4, 5, 6], indicate that at a density of order 1013 g cm\u22123 , rather\nsmall compared with \u03c1s , roughly spherical nuclei turn into elongated rod-like nuclei. Accordingly, the lattice structure is changed from a regular bcc lattice to a two-dimensional\ntriangular lattice. With further increasing density, these rod-like nuclei are transformed\ninto slab-like nuclei, which are arranged in the form of a layered lattice. After that, a twodimensional triangular lattice of rod-like bubbles and a bcc Coulomb lattice of roughly\n2\n\n\fspherical bubbles appear in turn. At last, at a density of about \u03c1s /2, the system dissolves\ninto uniform nuclear matter. Since slabs and rods look like \"lasagna\" and \"spaghetti\", the\nphases with positional order of one- and two-dimension are often referred to as \"pasta\"\nphases.\nIt is of interest to note the relevance of non-spherical nuclei to pulsar glitches and\ncooling of neutron stars. Pulsar glitches are usually considered to be manifestation of\na sudden large-scale release of neutron vortices trapped by some pinning centers in the\ncrust [7]. The force needed to pin vortices has yet to be clarified completely even for a bcc\nlattice of spherical nuclei due mainly to the uncertain properties of impurities and defects\nwhich may be involved in the vortex pinning [8]. Whether or not neutron vortex pinning\noccurs in the \"pasta\" phases possibly formed depends also on the unknown properties of\nimpurities and defects in the lattice. The presence of non-spherical nuclei would accelerate\nthe cooling of the corresponding region of neutron stars by opening semi-leptonic weak\nprocesses which are unlikely to occur for spherical nuclei [4]. This stems from the fact that\nin non-spherical nuclei, protons have a continuous spectrum at the Fermi surface in the\nelongated direction. However, such additional cooling would be rather small compared\nwith the overall cooling of the stars, since the mass of the region where non-spherical\nnuclei are expected to occur is only a tiny fraction of the total mass of the star.\nAt what densities the phases with non-spherical nuclei and with bubbles are energetically more favorable than the usual bcc phase and the phase of uniform nuclear matter\ndepends on the properties of neutron-rich nuclei and of the surrounding pure neutron gas.\nThe quantities that mainly describe such properties but are still uncertain are the nuclear\n\n3\n\n\fsurface tension Esurf and the energy required to add a proton to the pure neutron gas, i.e.,\nthe proton chemical potential \u03bc(0)\np . Esurf controls the size of the nuclei and bubbles, and\nhence the sum of the electrostatic and interfacial energies. With increasing Esurf and so\nthis energy sum, the density \u03c1m at which the system becomes uniform is lowered. There\n(0)\nis also a tendency that the lower \u03bc(0)\np , the smaller \u03c1m . This is because \u2212\u03bcp represents\n\nthe degree to which the neutron gas favors the presence of protons in itself. This feature is implied by the work of Arponen [9] who studied the sensitivity of the properties\nof uniform nuclear matter at low proton fraction to the melting density \u03c1m . Although\nEsurf and \u03bc(0)\np have not been fully determined, previous authors (e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 6]) designated the values of these quantities almost uniquely. In this paper, by generalizing a\ncompressible liquid-drop model developed by Baym, Bethe and Pethick [10] (hereafter\ndenoted by BBP) in such a way as to incorporate uncertainties in Esurf and \u03bc(0)\np , we draw\nthe equilibrium phase diagrams of zero-temperature neutron star matter at subnuclear\ndensities. The resulting phase diagrams show that while the phases with rod-like bubbles\nand with spherical bubbles can exist only for unrealistically low Esurf , the phases with\nrod-like nuclei and with slab-like nuclei survive almost independently of Esurf and \u03bc(0)\np .\nFor these two phases, there are directions in which the system is translationally invariant. As noted by Pethick and Potekhin [11], this situation is geometrically analogous with\na liquid crystal rather than with a rigid solid. Elastic properties of the nuclear rods and\nslabs are thus characterized by elastic constants used for the corresponding liquid-crystal\nphases, i.e., columnar phases and smectics A, respectively. They expressed such constants\nin terms of the interfacial and Coulomb energies. These energies, as well as the energies\n\n4\n\n\fof bulk nucleon matter and of a electron gas, are well described by the zero-temperature\n< 109 K, as inferred from Xapproximation. This is because the temperature of the crust \u223c\n\nray observations of rotation-powered pulsars, is small compared with typical nuclear and\nelectronic excitation energies. However, such temperature may have consequence to the\nstructure of the Coulomb lattices involved. For example, the outer boundary of the crust\nis acutely controlled by the temperature because of the density dependence of the melting\ntemperature of the bcc lattice [12]. In the deepest region of the crust, thermal fluctuations may possibly spoil the ordering sustained by the layered and triangular lattices, as\nexpected from the usual Landau-Peierls argument. We thus calculate thermally induced\ndisplacements of non-spherical nuclei by using the elastic constants given by Pethick and\nPotekhin [11]. The critical temperatures at which the ordered structure is destroyed by\nthe thermal fluctuations are also estimated.\nIn Section 2 we construct a compressible liquid-drop model for nuclei and bubbles,\nand we write down equilibrium conditions for zero-temperature matter in the crust. The\nresultant phase diagrams are displayed in Section 3. Properties of the phase transitions\ninvolved are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5 displacements of rod-like and slab-like\nnuclei are calculated at finite temperatures. Conclusions are given in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nModel for neutron star matter at subnuclear densities\n\nIn this section, we write the energy of zero-temperature matter in the crust and the\nconditions for its equilibrium. We consider five phases which contain spherical nuclei,\n\n5\n\n\fcylindrical nuclei, planar nuclei, cylindrical bubbles and spherical bubbles, respectively.\nEach phase is taken to be composed of a single species of nucleus or bubble at a given\nbaryon density nb . Crystalline structures of these phases are taken into account in the\nWigner-Seitz approximation, which leads to sufficiently accurate evaluations of the lattice\nenergy [5]. In this approximation, a cell in the bcc lattice, including a spherical nucleus or\nbubble of radius rN , is replaced by a Wigner-Seitz cell defined as a sphere having radius\nrc and the same center. A cylindrical nucleus or bubble having an infinitely long axis\nand a circular section of radius rN is taken to be contained in a cylindrical Wigner-Seitz\ncell having the same axis and a circular section of radius rc in place of a cell in the\ntwo-dimensional triangular lattice. For a planar nucleus with width 2rN , a cell in the\none-dimensional layered lattice, having width 2rc , is identified with the corresponding\nWigner-Seitz cell. The values of rc for these phases are chosen so that each Wigner-Seitz\ncell may have zero net charge and hence have the same volume as that of the original cell.\n\n2.1\n\nEnergy of matter\n\nFor the purpose of constructing a formula for the energy of the system allowing for uncertainties in Esurf and \u03bc(0)\np , a compressible liquid-drop model for nuclei and bubbles is\nof practical use, which is characterized by the energy densities of uniform nuclear matter\nand neutron matter as well as by the interfacial and Coulomb energies. In this model,\nneutrons and protons are assumed to be distributed uniformly inside and outside the nuclei or bubbles. A sea of electrons, which ensures the charge neutrality of the system, is\n\n6\n\n\ftaken to be homogeneous. We thus write the total energy density Etot as\nEtot =\n\n(\n\nwN + wL + (1 \u2212 u)En (nn ) + Ee (ne )\nwN + wL + uEn (nn ) + Ee (ne )\n\n(nuclei) ,\n(bubbles) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere wN is the energy of the nuclear matter region in a cell as divided by the cell volume,\nwL is the lattice energy per unit volume as given for the finite-size nuclei or bubbles, nn is\nthe number density of neutrons outside the nuclei or inside the bubbles, ne is the number\ndensity of the electrons, En and Ee are the energy densities of the neutron matter and\nof the electron gas, respectively, and u is the volume fraction occupied by the nuclei or\nbubbles,\nrN\nu=\nrc\n\u0012\n\n\u0013d\n\n=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nwhere d is the dimensionality defined as\n\nnb \u2212 nn\n(nuclei) ,\nn \u2212 nn\n(2)\nn \u2212 nb\n(bubbles) ,\nn \u2212 nn\nd = 1 for slabs, d = 2 for cylinders and d = 3 for\n\nspheres, and n is the nucleon number density in the nuclear matter region. In Eq. (1), we\nignore corrections due to nucleon pairing effects, shell and curvature effects in the nuclei\nand bubbles, and deformations and surface diffuseness of the nuclei and bubbles.\nIn writing wN , we adopt a generalized version of the compressible liquid drop model\ndeveloped by BBP [10]. wN is then expressed as\n\nwN (n, x, nn , rN , rc , d) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nun[(1 \u2212 x)mn + xmp ]c2 + unW (k, x)\n+wsurf (n, x, nn , rN , u, d) + wC (n, x, rN , u, d)\n(1 \u2212 u)n[(1 \u2212 x)mn + xmp ]c2 + (1 \u2212 u)nW (k, x)\n+wsurf (n, x, nn , rN , u, d) + wC (n, x, rN , u, d)\n\n(nuclei) ,\n\n(bubbles) ,\n(3)\n\nwhere mn (mp ) is the neutron (proton) rest mass, W (k, x) is the energy per nucleon\nfor uniform nuclear matter of nucleon Fermi wave number k = (3\u03c0 2 n/2)1/3 and proton\n7\n\n\ffraction x, as given by BBP [see Eq. (3.19) in Ref. [10]], wsurf is the nuclear surface energy\nper unit volume, and wC is the self Coulomb energy (per unit volume) of protons contained\nin a cell.\nW (k, x) includes four parameters characterizing the saturation properties of nearly\nsymmetric nuclear matter, which are the binding energy w0 , the saturation density 2k03 /3\u03c0 2 ,\nthe incompressibility K and the coefficient s determining the symmetry energy. In the\npresent work, the values for these parameters determined empirically by BBP in such\na way as to reproduce nuclear masses and radii of \u03b2 stable nuclei are replaced by the\nfollowing values that are generally accepted among recent literature: w0 = 16.0 MeV,\nk0 = 1.36 fm\u22121 , K = 230 MeV and s = 30.0 MeV. We remark in passing that such a\nreplacement makes no significant difference in the phase diagrams for neutron star matter\nat subnuclear densities that will be exhibited in Section 3.\nThe proton chemical potential \u03bc(0)\np in pure neutron matter is contained in W (k, x).\nThis quantity, dominating stability of the phases including a dripped neutron gas over\nthe phase of uniform nuclear matter, has not been well determined from microscopic\ncalculations based on nucleon-nucleon interactions. We thus set \u03bc(0)\np (not including the\nrest mass) as\n2/3\n\u03bc(0)\n,\np = \u2212C1 nn\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C1 is the free parameter being positive definite. As can be seen from Fig. 1, Eq.\n(4) approximately reproduces the overall density dependence of the results obtained from\nthe Hartree-Fock theory with Skyrme interactions (see Ref. [13] and references therein)\nand from the lowest-order Brueckner theory with the Reid soft-core potential [14, 15].\n8\n\n\fHereafter, C1 will be set as C1 = 300, 400, 500, 600 MeV fm2 ; the case of C1 = 300 MeV\nfm2 agrees well with the result of Siemens and Pandharipande [14] adopted by BBP,\nwhereas the case of C1 = 400 MeV fm2 is consistent with the other results cited in Fig. 1\n< 0.12 fm\u22123 .\nfor densities of interest to us n \u223c\n\nIn constructing the surface energy per unit volume wsurf , we take note of the expression\ngiven by BBP [see Eq. (4.30) in Ref. [10]] and the Hartree-Fock calculations by Ravenhall,\nBennett and Pethick [16] (hereafter denoted by RBP) using a Skyrme interaction. For\ncomparison, it is useful to consider the surface tension Esurf that is independent of the\nshapes of nuclei and bubbles; this is related to wsurf via\nEsurf =\n\nrN wsurf\n.\nud\n\n(5)\n\nFollowing the spirit of Iida and Sato [17], we express Esurf as\nEsurf = C2 tanh\n\nC3\n(0)\n\u03bcn\n\n!\n\nBBP\nEsurf\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere C2 and C3 are the adjustable parameters that will be discussed just below, \u03bc(0)\nn =\n\u2202En /\u2202nn \u2212 mn c2 is the neutron chemical potential in the neutron gas not including the\nrest mass, and\nBBP\nEsurf\n=\n\n\u03c3(n \u2212 nn )2/3 [W (kn , 0) \u2212 W (k, x)]\n,\n(36\u03c0)1/3 w0\n\n(7)\n\nwith kn = (3\u03c0 2 nn /2)1/3 and \u03c3 = 21.0 MeV. If we set C2 = 1.0 and C3 = 3.5 MeV for\nC1 = 400 MeV fm2 , as shown in Fig. 2, the surface tension calculated for matter in\nequilibrium (see Subsection 2.2 for details) agrees well with the RBP values for proton\n< 0.2. For C = 300, 500, 600 MeV fm2 , consistency with the\nfractions of interest here x \u223c\n1\n\nRBP values is also obtained from C2 = 1.0 and C3 = 3.5 MeV. Hereafter this value of C3\n9\n\n\fwill be fixed, whereas, for our present purpose of examining the dependence on nuclear\nmodels of the equilibrium phase diagrams for matter in the crust, we shall shake the\nvalues of C2 within a rather wide range covering C2 = 1.0 (see Section 3).\nWe proceed to express the total electrostatic energy per unit volume wC+L = wC + wL .\nIn the Wigner-Seitz approximation adopted here, it reads [1]\nwC+L = 2\u03c0(exnrN )2 ufd (u) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith\n1\ndu1\u22122/d\n2\nfd (u) =\n1\u2212\nd+2 d\u22122\n2\n\"\n\n!\n\n#\n\n+u .\n\n(9)\n\nThe energy density of the pure neutron gas, whose density derivative \u03bc(0)\nn , together\nwith Esurf and \u03bc(0)\np , plays a role in determining the melting density \u03c1m [13], is set by using\nW (k, x) as\nEn (nn ) = [W (kn , 0) + mn c2 ]nn .\n\n(10)\n\nNote that this energy density corresponds to the fitting formula determined by BBP [see\n< 1.7 fm\u22123 obtained by Siemens\nEq. (3.8) in Ref. [10]] so as to reproduce the data for kn \u223c\n\nand Pandharipande [14] in the lowest-order Brueckner theory with the Reid soft-core\n< k , as can be seen from comparison\npotential. These data hold good at least for kn \u223c\n0\n\nwith the results from several works based on more elaborate many-body schemes and\npotential models [13]. We shall thus use the BBP formula without any modification.\nThe energy density of the free electron gas, which is relativistic and degenerate, is\nfinally expressed as\n3\nEe (ne ) = h\u0304cke ne ,\n4\n10\n\n(11)\n\n\fwith the electron Fermi wave number ke = (3\u03c0 2 ne )1/3 . Here, we ignore the electron mass\nand the electron Hartree-Fock energy.\n\n2.2\n\nEquilibrium conditions\n\nAs a next step towards the description of the equilibrium phase diagrams for crustal\nmatter, we minimize the energy density Etot with respect to five variables n, x, nn , rN\nand u under fixed baryon density nb ,\nnb =\n\n(\n\nun + (1 \u2212 u)nn\n(1 \u2212 u)n + unn\n\n(nuclei) ,\n(bubbles) .\n\n(12)\n\nand under charge neutrality,\nne =\n\n(\n\nxnu\nxn(1 \u2212 u)\n\n(nuclei) ,\n(bubbles) .\n\n(13)\n\nSuch minimization results in four equilibrium conditions, which were given by BBP for\nspherical nuclei (see Section 2 in Ref. [10]).\nOptimization of Etot with respect to rN at fixed n, x, nn and u leads to a familiar\nrelation for size-equilibrium,\nwsurf = 2wC+L .\n\n(14)\n\nThis relation is thus independent of dimensionality d. Such independence was understood\n[1] from the fact that the system, no matter what type of nucleus or bubble it may contain,\nis in a three-dimensional physical space.\nThe condition for equilibrium of the dripped neutrons with the neutrons in the nuclear\nmatter region, arising from minimization of Etot with respect to n at fixed nb , nx, rN and\n\n11\n\n\fu, reads\n\u03bc(N)\n= \u03bc(G)\n.\nn\nn\nHere\n\u03bc(N)\n=\nn\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u2202(wN + wL )\nu\u2202n\n\nnx,nn ,rN ,u\n\n(15)\n\n\u2212 mn c2\n\n(nuclei)\n(16)\n\n1 \u2202(wN + wL )\n1\u2212u\n\u2202n\n\nnx,nn ,rN ,u\n\n\u2212 mn c2\n\n(bubbles)\n\nis the neutron chemical potential in the nuclear matter region, and\n\n\u03bc(G)\n=\nn\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n!\n\n1 \u2202wN\n\u2202En\n\u2212 mn c2 +\n\u2202nn\n1 \u2212 u \u2202nn\n!\n\n\u2202En\n1 \u2202wN\n\u2212 mn c2 +\n\u2202nn\nu \u2202nn\n\n(nuclei)\nn,x,rN ,u\n\n(17)\n(bubbles)\n\nn,x,rN ,u\n\nis the neutron chemical potential in the neutron gas modified by the surface energy.\nThe condition that the nuclear matter region is stable against \u03b2-decay is yielded by\nminimization of Etot with respect to x at fixed n, nn , rN and u.

In such calculations, we first\nexpress x, rN and rc in terms of nb , n and nn by using conditions (12), (14) and (18). In\n(G)\nthis stage, we can rewrite \u03bc(N)\nand P (N) given by Eqs.

Substitution of these\nvalues into Eq. (1) leads thus to the minimum values of Etot at given nb and conformation.\nThe energy density for \u03b2-equilibrated uniform nuclear matter has also been evaluated at\nthe same nb by using the energy densities nW (k, x) and Ee (ne ) and by following a line of\nargument of BBP (see Section 8 in Ref. [10]). Here we ignore the presence of muons, the\nnumber density of which is, if any, far smaller than ne for densities of interest here. We\nhave finally found the phase giving the smallest energy density among the uniform and\ncrystalline phases; the resultant phase diagrams for the ground-state matter at subnuclear\ndensities will be shown in the next section.\n\n3\n\nPhase diagrams\n\nWe may now draw the phase diagrams for neutron star matter in the ground state on the\nnb versus C2 plane for C1 = 300, 400, 500, 600 MeV fm2 .1 The results have been plotted\nin Fig. 3. We have thus confirmed the tendency, as mentioned in Section 1, that larger\nEsurf and lower \u03bc(0)\np help the uniform matter phase \"erode\" the phases with non-spherical\n1\n\nNote that these diagrams are different from the usual ones written over the density versus temperature\nplane.\n\n14\n\n\fnuclei and with bubbles.\nAs can be found from Fig. 3, the obtained phase diagrams basically reproduce the\nfeature that with increasing density, the shape of the nuclear matter region changes like\nsphere \u2192 cylinder \u2192 slab \u2192 cylindrical hole \u2192 spherical hole \u2192 uniform matter. This\nfeature can be derived from simple discussions about the Coulomb and surface effects\nignoring the bulk energy [3]. We also find that the energy difference between two successive\nphases is generally of order 0.1\u20131 keV per nucleon (see Fig. 4); this result is consistent\nwith that obtained by others in earlier investigations (e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 6]). However, it is\nsignificant to notice that for most sets of C1 and C2 including the typical one (C1 = 400\nMeV fm2 and C2 = 1.0), the shape changes become simpler, i.e., sphere \u2192 cylinder \u2192 slab\n\u2192 uniform matter. This behavior, due probably to bulk corrections to the Coulomb and\nsurface effects, was not observed in the previous works (see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 6]). Since the\nvalues of En , \u03bc(0)\np and Esurf as adopted by these works are consistent with those obtained\nhere for C1 = 400 MeV fm2 and C2 = 1.0, we may conclude that the difference in the phase\ndiagrams should originate mainly from that in the properties of uniform nuclear matter\nat low but f inite proton fractions, i.e., x \u223c 0.1. These properties depend on the adopted\nschemes for constructing interpolation between almost pure neutron matter and nearly\nsymmetric nuclear matter in the absence of reliable microscopic calculations of the energy\ndensity of uniform nuclear matter at intermediate proton fractions. Better understanding\nof the equilibrium properties of neutron star matter at subnuclear densities will thus\nrequire future theoretical and/or experimental works covering the region of intermediate\nproton fractions.\n\n15\n\n\fCurvature effects in nuclei and bubbles, which were at least implicitly taken into\naccount in Refs. [4, 5, 6] while have been ignored in the present analysis, may be another\nsource of the difference in the phase diagrams from such earlier works. This is due to the\nconformation dependence of these effects: wcurv (sphere)> wcurv (cylinder) > wcurv (slab)\n= 0 > wcurv (cylindrical hole) > wcurv (spherical hole), where wcurv is the curvature energy\nper unit volume. The degree of the resultant stability of the higher-density crystalline\nphase over the lower-density one depends on the values of wcurv , which are also uncertain\nat x \u223c 0.1. If we determine these values from the curvature thermodynamic potential\nobtained by Kolehmainen et al. [18] in the Thomas-Fermi theory with Skyrme interactions,\nthe energy gain of the higher-density crystalline phase with respect to the lower-density\none amounts to a few keV per nucleon. For our typical nuclear model (C1 = 400 MeV\nfm2 and C2 = 1.0), as can be seen from Fig. 4, such curvature effects do not lead to\nappearance of the density region where the phases with bubbles are stable, but do lower\nthe transition density from sphere to cylinder and that from cylinder to slab by 10% or\nso. In Fig. 3, correspondingly, the region surrounded by the bcc phase and the uniform\nphase is expected to enlarge.\n\n4\n\nProperties of phase transitions\n\nThe structural transitions examined in the previous section are first-order transitions.\nThis is because the above-mentioned sequence of geometrical structure is mainly determined by the competition between the surface and Coulomb energies. In order to confirm\nthis property, we have plotted in Fig. 5 the sizes of the nucleus or bubble and of the\n\n16\n\n\fWigner-Seitz cell, rN and rc , evaluated as functions of nb for C1 = 400 MeV fm2 and\nC2 = 1.0. It can be clearly seen from this figure that rN and rc jump at the transition\npoints. It is of interest to note that for C2 = 0.01, in which all the types of crystalline\nphases occur, the cell size rc shows a dependence on the dimensionality d such that it\nis largest for d = 3 (spheres and spherical holes) and smallest for d = 1 (slabs). This\nbehavior was also obtained from the previous liquid-drop-model calculations [4].\nThe neutron density profile is useful in probing how the system dissolves into uniform\nmatter. In Fig. 6 we have thus plotted the neutron densities in the nuclear matter region\nand the neutron gas region for the crystalline phases as well as the one for the uniform\nphase, evaluated as functions of nb for C1 = 300, 400, 500, 600 MeV fm2 and C2 = 1.0.\nFor these parameter sets, as shown in Fig. 3, there is a melting transition from the phase\nwith slab-like nuclei to the uniform phase. We can observe from Fig. 6 that as the\ndensity approaches the melting point, the neutron distribution becomes more and more\nsmooth. This behavior, as we have confirmed for various values of C2 , is consistent with\nthe results from the Thomas-Fermi calculations [5, 19]. We also find that at the melting\npoint, the neutron density profile is discontinuous between the crystalline and uniform\nphases, indicating that the transition is of first order. However, this discontinuity should\nbe fairly small as compared with the case of matter created in stellar collapse. In this\ncase, due to larger proton fraction x yielded by degenerate neutrinos, such a discontinuity\nshould become so large that neighbouring nuclei (or bubbles) appear to touch and fuse\nwith each other at the melting point. Detailed estimates made for this material will be\nreported elsewhere.\n\n17\n\n\f5\n\nThermal fluctuations\n\nLet us now estimate thermally induced displacements of rod-like and slab-like nuclei from\ntheir equilibrium positions; the presence of these nuclei is energetically favored for typical\nvalues of C1 and C2 , as shown in Section 3. For such estimates, we first write the elastic\nconstants for the phases containing these nuclei by following Pethick and Potekhin [11].\nSince the phase with slab-like (rod-like) nuclei is structurally similar to a smectic A\n(columnar phase) liquid crystal, they derived the expressions for the elastic constants by\ncomparing the energy increase due to deformation, obtained from the liquid-drop model\nfor the nuclei in the incompressible limit, with that used for the corresponding liquid\ncrystals. For the layered phase composed of slab-like nuclei, the energy density due to\ndisplacement v of layers in their normal direction (taken to be parallel to the z-axis) can\nbe written as [20]\n\"\n\nB \u2202v 1\n\u2212 (\u2207\u22a5 v)2\nF =\n2 \u2202z 2\n\n#2\n\n+\n\nK1 2 2\n(\u2207\u22a5 v) .\n2\n\n(27)\n\nHere, the elastic constants B and K1 are expressed as [11]\nB = 6wC+L ,\nK1 =\n\n(28)\n\n2\nwC+L(1 + 2u \u2212 2u2 )rc2 .\n15\n\n(29)\n\nFor the two-dimensional triangular lattice of rod-like nuclei, the energy density due to a\ntwo-dimensional displacement vector v = (vx , vy ) of cylinders running along the z-axis is\ngiven by [20]\nB\nF =\n2\n\n\u2202vx \u2202vy\n+\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n!2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u2202vx \u2202vy\nC\n\u2212\n+ \uf8f0\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n18\n\n!2\n\n\u2202vx \u2202vy\n+\n+\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n\fK3\n+\n2\n\n\u22022v\n\u2202z 2\n\n!2\n\n+B\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202vx \u2202vy\n+\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n!\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202z\n\n!2\n\nB \u2032\u2032\n+\n2\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202z\n\n!4\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nHere, the elastic constants B, B \u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 , C and K3 read [11]\n3\nwC+L ,\n2\n3\n= \u2212 wC+L ,\n4\n3\nwC+L ,\n=\n8\n\nB =\n\n(31)\n\nB\u2032\n\n(32)\n\nB \u2032\u2032\n\n(33)\n\nC \u2243 102.1(u\u22120.3) wC+L ,\nK3 \u2243 0.0655wC+L rc2\n\n(34)\n\n< u < 0.55) .\n(for 0.15 \u223c\n\u223c\n\n(35)\n\nIn Eqs.

(30), we obtain [21]\nkB T\n\u221a\n,\n(37)\n(B + 2C) \u03c0\u03bba\nq\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bb = 2K3 /(B + 2C), and a = (2\u03c0/ 3)1/2 rc is the lattice constant for hexagoh|v|2 i \u2243\n\nnal cells.3 Expressions (36) and (37) are analogous to those appearing in the context\n\nof Landau-Peierls instabilities, which destroy a one-dimensional ordering in an inf inite\nthree-dimensional system.\nIn Fig. 7 (8) we have plotted the ratio\n\nq\n\nh|v|2 i/(a/2 \u2212 rN ) of the root-mean-square\n\ndisplacement of the slab-like (rod-like) nucleus, calculated from Eq. (36) [(37)] for kB T =\n0.1 MeV, to the shortest distance between the surface of the nucleus in its equilibrium\nposition and the boundary of the cell containing it. In these calculations we have set\nL = 10 km, which is the typical neutron star radius. The results for the layered phase,\ndepending on L logarithmically, are essentially unchanged by the choice of L; when we\nset L = 1 \u03bcm, for example, the values shown in Fig. 7 are only multiplied by a factor\nof \u2243 0.7. It is obvious from comparison between Figs. 7 and 8 that for the same C1\nand C2 the relative displacement of the slab-like nucleus is appreciably large compared\nwith that of the rod-like nucleus, a feature yielded by the logarithmic factor appearing\nin Eq. (36). We also find that the relative displacement for both lattices decreases with\nincreasing surface tension (or C2 ). This is because the elastic constants, acting to reduce\nthe displacements given by Eqs. (36) and (37), are proportional to the equilibrium value\n3\nStrictly speaking, Eq. (37) is valid when the length of the nuclei is large compared with the linear\ndimension of the lattice in the xy plane. This situation is energetically preferred over the opposite case,\nin which there is a larger total sectional area of the nuclei at the boundary of the lattice.\n\n20\n\n\fof wC+L satisfying condition (14).\nIt is noteworthy that for the typical parameter set (C1 = 400 MeV fm2 and C2 = 1.0),\nthe relative displacement for the layered phase at kB T = 0.1 MeV, as plotted in Fig. 7,\ntakes on values of up to about unity. The planar nucleus deformed to such an extent\ntouches the boundary of the neighbouring cell as defined in the case in which the lattice\nis in its equilibrium. This suggests the possibility that the fluctuational displacements\ndestroy the ordered configuration in a length scale of down to \u223c rc even at temperatures\ntypical of matter in the neutron star crust.4 In theoretically predicting the interiors\nof observed neutron stars having various temperature profiles, therefore, it is useful to\nestimate as a function of nb the critical temperature Tc at which the relative displacements\nbecome unity. The results obtained for the layered lattice and the triangular lattice have\nbeen plotted in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively.5 The difference in Tc between these two\nlattices, as can be observed from Figs. 9 and 10, suggests that if formation of these two\nlattices can occur dynamically in the star, the layered phase is formed later than the\ntriangular phase during the star' s cooling.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have examined the dependence on the surface tension Esurf and on the proton chemical\npotential \u03bc(0)\np in pure neutron matter, of the density region in which the presence of non4\n\nReconnection of the planar nuclei that may be involved in such destruction leads inevitably to\ndepartures from thermodynamic equilibrium, which are beyond the scope of this paper.\n5\nNote that the values of Tc are meaningless when they are smaller than the crossover temperature T0\nfrom the classical to the quantum fluctuations; in this case, quantum effects keep the relative displacement\nlarge compared with unity for T < T0 .\n\n21\n\n\fspherical nuclei and of bubbles is energetically favored at T = 0. We have found that as\nEsurf decreases or \u03bc(0)\np increases, such a density region becomes larger. For the values of\nEsurf and \u03bc(0)\np as adopted in recent literature, our results show that in the ground state, the\nphases with rod-like nuclei and with slab-like nuclei lie between the bcc lattice phase and\nthe uniform nuclear matter phase. The fluctuational displacements of such non-spherical\nnuclei from their equilibrium positions have been estimated at finite temperature. It has\nbeen suggested that at temperatures typical of matter in the neutron star crust, such\nfluctuations may melt the layered lattice of slab-like nuclei.\nEven if rod-like and slab-like nuclei are thermodynamically stable, whether or not they\nare actually present in the star depends on occurrence of the dynamical processes leading\nto their formation. These processes are thought to involve instabilities against nuclear\ndeformation and against proton clustering in uniform nuclear matter [1]. If the occurrence\nof such processes were confirmed, it would become still more significant to consider effects\nof the presence of non-spherical nuclei on the structure and evolution of neutron stars.\nIn the context of pulsar glitches, the question of what kind of impurities and defects are\nformed in the lattices of non-spherical nuclei would be essential to understanding of the\nmechanism for neutron vortex pinning. For neutron star cooling, it would be interesting\nto consider the direct URCA processes in non-spherical nuclei; as suggested by Lorenz\net al. [4], these processes might be allowed by the proton continuous spectrum in the\nelongated direction of the nuclei, in contrast to the case of roughly spherical nuclei, and\nby the band structure of neutrons moving in the periodic potential created by the nuclei.\n\n22\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Professor Takeo Izuyama for useful discussion and valuable comments.\nThis work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research provided by\nthe Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan through Research Grant No.\n07CE2002 and No. 10-03687.\n\n23\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.J.
