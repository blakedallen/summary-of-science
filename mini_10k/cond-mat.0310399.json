The\ninterest is motivated not only by their unusual properties such as negative magnetoresistance [5], but, even\nto a higher extent, by the fact that they represent an\nexemplary disordered electronic system with experimentally accessible tunable parameters. A specific feature\nof granular metallic materials is the important role of\nthe Coulomb interaction that strongly affects their behavior. The interplay between the Coulomb interaction\neffects and disorder was shown to suppress an electron\ntransport in granular metals [6, 7, 8]; the fundamental\nquestion that remains open is how the Coulomb repulsion affects the superconducting properties of granular\nmetals, and in particular, the superconducting transition\ntemperature.\nCoulomb interactions decrease the critical temperature, this effect is amplified significantly in the presence of disorder and becomes especially pronounced in\nlower dimensions. For example in 2D (disordered) superconducting films the effect of Coulomb repulsions is\nknown to noticeably decrease the critical temperature\n[9, 10, 11, 12]. The mechanism of suppression of the\ntransition temperature can be understood as a result\nof the renormalization of the electron interaction in the\nCooper channel by the Coulomb repulsion in the presence of scattering by impurities [13]. Since in granular\nsamples both disorder and the strong Coulomb repulsion\neffects present, one expects that similar mechanism governs the reduction of the superconducting critical temperate and becomes even more pronounced for granular\nsuperconductors.\nIn this Letter we investigate the influence of Coulomb\nrepulsion on the superconducting transition temperature\nof granular metals and demonstrate that depending on\nthe parameters of the grains, the granular materials can\nbe divided into two groups: (i) materials that may be\nfound in either insulating or superconducting state at\n\nzero temperature and (ii) materials that can, in addition,\nexhibit an intermediate metallic state. The parameter\nthat governs the corresponding behavior is the tunneling\nconductance gT . The transport properties of granular\nmetals were recently extensively studied in Ref. [6, 7, 8].\nIt was shown that for 3D samples there is a critical value\nof the bare tunneling conductance [8]\ngTC = (1/6\u03c0) ln(EC /\u03b4),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere EC is the Coulomb energy and \u03b4 is the mean level\nspacing in a single grain, that allows to classify granular\nsamples by their transport properties: samples with gT <\ngTC are insulators at zero temperature while samples with\ngT > gTC are metals. We show that in order to classify 3D\nsuperconducting granular samples with respect to their\npossible ground state at zero temperature, an additional\ncharacteristic conductance gT\u2217 should be introduced:\ngT\u2217 \u2248\n\nA 2\nln (EC /Tc0)\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Tc0 is the superconducting critical temperature of\na single grain and A is the numerical coefficient defined\nbelow. We demonstrate that granular superconductors\ncan be conveniently classified depending on the relation\nbetween gTC and gT\u2217 into two groups:\n(i) Group A: Granular samples with gT\u2217 < gTC may have\nonly two phases at zero temperature depending on the\ntunneling conductance gT . They are either superconductors if gT > gT\u2217 , or insulators if gT < gT\u2217 .\n(ii) Group B: Samples with gT\u2217 > gTC can be found in\nthree phases. They are superconductors if gT > gT\u2217 , insulators if gT < gTC , or metals in the intermediate region\ngT\u2217 > gT > gTC .\nThus, in the latter case there exists an intermediate\nmetallic region gT\u2217 > gT > gTC where the superconductivity is suppressed by the Coulomb interaction while effects\nof Coulomb blockade are not yet strong.\nPresenting our final result for the suppression of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature we distinguish\n\n\f2\nthe high temperature, Tc0 > gT \u03b4, and low temperature,\nTc0 < gT \u03b4, regimes: For 3D systems the suppression of\nthe transition temperature is given by\n\u2206Tc\n=\u2212\nTc0\n\n(\n\nA\n\u03c0gT\nA\n\u03c0gT\n\nln2 gTTE0 C ,\nc\nh\nln2 gTTE0 C \u2212\nc\n\nTc0 > gT \u03b4\n1\n2\n\nln2\n\ngT \u03b4\nTc0\n\ni\n\n,\n\nTc0 < gT \u03b4\n\n\u2206Tc\n=\u2212\nTc0\n\n1\n6\u03c0 2 gT\n1\n6\u03c0 2 gT\n\nln3 gTTE0 C ,\nc\nh\nln3 gTTE0 C \u2212\n\nj\n\nc)\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni\n\nj\n\nTc0 > gT \u03b4\n\n.\n, Tc0 < gT \u03b4\n(3b)\nR\n3 \u22121\nHere A = gT a3 d3 q/(2\u03c0)\n\u03b5\nis\nthe\ndimensionless\nconP q\nstant where \u03b5q = 2gT a (1 \u2212 cos qa) with {a} being\nthe lattice vectors. Equations (3) hold at temperatures\nTc0 \u2212 Tc \u226a Tc0 .\nTurning to the discussion of the results (3), we note\nthat the existence of two qualitatively different temperature regimes (T > gT \u03b4 and T < gT \u03b4 ) is not surprising\nin view of the results for corrections to conductivity obtained in Ref. [8], where it was shown that the temperature dependence of the conductivity at T < gT \u03b4 is dominated by the contribution from coherent electron motion\nat large distances, while at T > gT \u03b4 the conductivity\nbehavior is controlled by the scales of the order of the\ngrain size. From Eq. (3a) one can see that the logarithmic corrections appear even in 3D case; this property can\nserve as a specific characteristic of granular metals. In\nthe high temperature regime T > gT \u03b4 similar logarithmic\ncorrections (with the same argument but different powers) were found in the corrections to the conductivity and\ndensity of states [7, 8]. Yet, the result for the critical\ntemperature suppression in the high temperature regime\ndepends on the dimensionality and is not universal contrary to the logarithmic corrections to conductivity found\nin the same regime in Ref. [7, 8]. We see that in granular\nsuperconducting films the suppression of the transition\ntemperature is much stronger than that in 3D granular\nsamples. The extra logarithm power in two dimensions\nis due to the contribution of low momenta q \u226a a\u22121 .\nOur classification for 3D granular superconductors can\nbe derived from the following arguments: The critical\nconductance gT\u2217 is defined by the condition that the correction (3a) becomes of the order of unity at gT \u2248 gT\u2217 .\nConsidering first the case where gT\u2217 < gTC , we see that\nthe system should be a superconductor at gT > gT\u2217 ,\nsince the conductance renormalization due to the effect\nof Coulomb interaction \u2206gT taken at the temperature\nT \u223c Tc0 is smaller than gT for all gT larger than gT\u2217 .\nIndeed \u2206gT = (1/6\u03c0) ln(gT EC /Tc0 ) < gT\u2217 . On the other\nhand, if gT < gT\u2217 , then the interaction in the Cooper\nchannel is completely suppressed and the system becomes\nan insulator at zero temperature because gT < gTC . Thus\nin the case gT\u2217 < gTC depending on the value of conductance gT one observes either insulating, at gT < gT\u2217 , or\nc\n\nb)\n\n(3a)\n\nwhile for granular films we obtain\n(\n\na)\n\n,\n\n1\n4\n\nln3\n\ngT \u03b4\nTc0\n\ni\n\nj\nd)\n\ne)\n\nj\n\nf)\n\nFIG. 1: Diagrams describing the first order self-energy corrections, \u03b4\u03bb1 to the Cooperon channel coupling constant \u03bb of\ngranular metals due to the electron-electron repulsion.

The second case, where gT\u2217 > gTC , is qualitatively\ndifferent due to appearance of the intermediate metallic\nphase: In the region gT > gT\u2217 the system is a superconductor, in the region gT\u2217 > gT > gTC the interaction\nin the Cooper channel is completely suppressed, and the\nsystem is metallic since gT > gTC , and finally in the region\ngT < gTC the system becomes an insulator.\nNow we turn to the quantitative description of our\nmodel and derivation of Eq. (3a): We consider a\nd\u2212dimensional array of superconducting grains in the\nmetallic state. The motion of electrons inside the grains\nis diffusive and they can tunnel between grains. We assume that in the absence of the Coulomb interaction, the\nsample would have been a good metal at T > Tc .\nThe system of weakly coupled superconducting grains\nis described by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u01240 + \u0124c + \u0124t .\n\n(4a)\n\nThe term \u01240 in Eq.

As in the case with homogeneous superconducting metals in the absence of the electron-electron\nrepulsion the transition temperature of granular metals\nis independent of disorder.\nTo study the suppression of the transition temperature in granular metals we take into account the electronelectron repulsion in the Cooper channel. The first order correction \u03b4\u03bb to the Cooperon channel coupling constant \u03bb due to electron-electron repulsion is given by\nthe diagrams in Figs. 1 and 2. These diagrams contain essentially the averaged one-particle Green functions (solid lines), effective screened Coulomb propagators (wave lines) and dashed lines that describe the elastic\ninteraction of electrons with impurities. In the regime under consideration all characteristic energies are less than\nThouless energy ET = D/a2 , where D is the diffusion coefficient of a single grain. This allows us to use the zero\ndimensional approximation for a single grain diffusion\nand Cooperon propagators. The electron hopping between the grains can be included using the diagrammatic\ntechnique developed in Refs. 5, 6. The complete expression for the renormalized Cooperon of granular metals\n(black rectangle in Fig. 1 and 2) has the following form\nC(\u03c9n , q) = (2\u03c0\u03bd\u03c4 2 )\u22121 (|\u03c9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)\u22121 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere q is the quasi-momentum, \u03c9n = 2\u03c0T n is the\nbosonic Matsubara frequency and \u03bd is the density of\nstates on the Fermi surface. The parameter \u03b5q in the\nright hand side of Eq. (5) appears due to the electron tunneling from grain to grain, it was defined below Eq. (3).\nDeriving the analytical result for the diagrams in\nFigs. 1 and 2 it is important to take into account the\nfact that the single electron propagator itself gets renormalized due to electron hopping. Tunneling processes\ngive rise an additional term to the self-energy part of the\nsingle electron propagator, see Fig. 3\n\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c40\u22121 + 2dgT \u03b4,\n\n(6)\n\nFIG. 2: Diagrams describing the first order vertex corrections,\n\u03b4\u03bb2 to the Cooperon channel coupling constant \u03bb of granular\nmetals due to the electron-electron repulsion. All notations\nare the same as in Fig. 1. The diagrams (b) - (d) should be\ntaken with additional factor of 2. After that the final result\nfor the sum of the diagrams (a) - (d) is given by Eq. (10).\n\nwhere \u03c40 is the unrenormalized electron mean free time\nand gT = 2\u03c0t2 \u03bd 2 is the dimensionless tunneling conductance. Although the second term in the right hand side\nof Eq. (6) is much smaller than the first one it is important to keep it because the leading order contribution in\n\u03c40\u22121 to the coupling constant \u03bb cancels ( see Eqs. (7) and\n(10) below).\nWe consider the contributions from diagrams in Fig. 1\nand 2 separately. Using the result of Eq. (6) it is straightforward to check that the sum of the diagrams (a)-(f)\nin Fig. 1 results in the following correction, \u03b4\u03bb1 to the\nCooperon channel coupling constant\n\uf8ee\n\u0012\nX\nX\n\u03b4\u03bb1\n2V (\u03a9n , q)\n2\n\uf8f0\n= \u2212\u03c0T\n\u03bb\n|\u03b5n | (|\u03a9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)2\nq\n\u03b5n (\u03b5n \u2212\u03a9n )<0\n\uf8f9\n\u0013\nX\nV (\u03a9n , q)\nV (\u03a9, q)\n\uf8fb.\n\u2212\n+ 2\n\u03b5n (|\u03a9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)\n\u03b52n (|2\u03b5n \u2212 \u03a9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)\n\u03b5n (\u03b5n \u2212\u03a9n )>0\n\nHere the summation is going over the quasi-momentum,\nq and over the fermionic, \u03b5n = \u03c0T (2n + 1) and bosonic,\n\u03a9n = 2\u03c0T n Matsubara frequencies. The propagator of\nthe screened electron-electron interaction, V (\u03a9n , q) in\nEq.

These diagrams\nresults in the following contribution\n\uf8ee\nX\nX\n\u03b4\u03bb2\nV (\u03a9n , q)\n\uf8f0\n= \u2212\u03c0T 2\n\u03bb\n|\u03b5n ||\u03b5n \u2212 \u03a9n |(|\u03a9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)\nq\n\u03b5n (\u03b5n \u2212\u03a9n )<0\n\uf8f9\nX\nV (\u03a9n , q)\n\uf8fb(10)\n.\n+\n|\u03b5n ||\u03b5n \u2212 \u03a9n |(|2\u03b5n \u2212 \u03a9n | + \u03b5q \u03b4)\n\u03b5n (\u03b5n \u2212\u03a9n )>0\n\nUsing Eqs. (8), (9) and summing over the frequencies \u03b5n ,\n\u03a9n and quasi-momentum, q in Eqs. (7) and (10) with\nthe logarithmic accuracy we obtain the final result (3) for\nthe superconducting transition temperature in granular\nmetals.\nIn conclusion, we considered the suppression of superconducting transition temperature due to Coulomb repulsion in granular metals. We found the correction to\nthe transition temperature for 3D granular samples and\nfilms at large tunneling conductance between the grains.\nWe demonstrated that the suppression of superconductivity in 3D samples can be characterized by the critical\nvalue of the conductance gT\u2217 introduced in Eq. (2) such\nthat for samples with gT < gT\u2217 the superconductivity\n\nis suppressed. Taking into account effects of Coulomb\nblockade of conductivity that become essential for samples with gT < gTC , where the critical value gTC is given by\nEq. (1) we introduced the classification of 3D granular\nsamples composed from superconducting grains according to the possibility of having insulating, metallic or\nsuperconducting phases at zero temperature.\nWe would like to thank A.
