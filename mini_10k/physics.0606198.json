Sci. Technol.\n\n\fThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most important parameters of any novel scintillator is the spectral response\nof the light produced. For the scintillator to be experimentally useful, this response\nmust match the responses of readily available photomultiplier photocathodes or other\nphotodetectors.\nIn the case of organic scintillators, the ultra-violet induced fluorescence spectrum\nis frequently measured, as this is considered to be identical to the scintillation spectrum\n[1, 2, 3] since both emissions are due to the same electronic transitions. However,\nit remains difficult to study the ultra-violet induced spectrum accurately where the\nabsorption and emission bands of the fluorescing molecules overlap. Further, the spectra\nemitted by organic solutions can be considerably different from the the spectra obtained\nby direct UV-excitation of the pure solutes [3].\nFor inorganic scintillators, the absorption bands are generally of such short\nwavelengths that generating a suitable excitation spectrum becomes problematic and\ntransmission of this through more than a few millimetres of material impossible [4].\nAdditionally, in many inorganic crystals, the emission spectra produced are known to\ndepend markedly on the exciting particles [5].\nThese considerations suggest that it would be preferable to excite the scintillator\ndirectly with radiation, rather than to rely on the ultra-violet induced spectrum. In\nthe case of organic scintillators, since \u03b1-particles will only penetrate the surface layers\nand because there are problems with absorption of \u03b3-rays in small samples, previous\nmeasurements have mainly been done using \u03b2-particles [6, 1, 2]. However, with the \u03b2particle energies emitted by available radioactive sources and typical organic scintillator\nefficiencies (one photon for 100eV energy deposited [7]), very little light is produced per\nevent. This light must be fed through a monochromator and then passed to a broad\nband photon detector in order to derive the spectrum.\nThe scintillation photons are emitted isotropically and the angular acceptance of\nmonochromators is inevitably low, consequently only a tiny fraction of the photons\nproduced will reach the detector. There is also the trade-off that if the monochromator\nis set for higher resolution, then the throughput is unavoidably reduced and the signalto-noise ratio is degraded. Attempts have been made to avoid the problems encountered\nwith \u03b2-sources by using electrons from accelerators [8, 9]. While these were successful,\nthe equipment required is unlikely to be generally available. More recent work to\ncharacterize a range of inorganic compounds has made use of a bench-top pulsed Xray system [10].\nThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra is essentially a signal-to-noise\nratio problem. The signal (here, the number of photons per event) can be increased\nby depositing more energy in the scintillator. Clearly there is a limit to the energy\nobtainable from \u03b2-particles from radioactive sources, while the use of accelerators to\nproduce higher energy electrons unnecessarily complicates the measurement. Increasing\nthe rate of events and integrating over many events is a workable option but this involves\n\n\fThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\n3\n\nworking with excessively radioactive sources and, while this may have been an option\nin the past, is no longer acceptable.\nSince it is clearly difficult to increase the signal, the next obvious approach is to\nattempt to reduce the noise. The principle source of noise is that of single-electron noise\nin the recording photomultiplier. Cooling the photomultiplier reduces this, but since\nnot all the noise is of thermal origin, this approach can only be partially successful. The\npresent method uses two photomultipliers and a coincidence technique to suppress the\nnoise, whatever its physical origin.\n2. Previous Measurements\nBefore describing the coincidence method in detail, it is worth reviewing the previous\nmeasurements and comparing their capabilities and achievements.\nOtt et al. [6] used a photographic technique to integrate the faint scintillation light\nfrom organic liquid samples over a long period of time. A 3.7GBq 137 Cs source providing\n\u03b2-particles of 0.51 and 1.17MeV was used. The resolution appears to have been less\nthan 5nm although this is not specified directly. Clear inconsistencies between the\nfluorescence and scintillation spectra were observed.\nVan Sciver [5] examined the spectral emission of sodium iodide crystals, excited by\neither a 60 Co \u03b3-ray source or a 242 Cm \u03b1-particle source. The light was passed through\na monochromator onto a photomultiplier cooled with dry ice and the DC output of this\nwas fed via an amplifier to a pen recorder. No specification of the spectral resolution\nof the system is given but responses are presented which suggest that the resolution is\n5nm.\nBirks [1] compared the scintillation and fluorescence spectra of organic solutions.\nA grating spectrometer was coupled to a photomultiplier, the DC output of which was\ncoupled to a chart recorder to chart the spectrum. \u03b2-particles of 1.71MeV were provided\nby a 52MBq 32 P source. To overcome the low intensity of the light emission, the input\nand output ports of the spectrometer were widened, giving a resolution of 8nm for the\nbetter scintillators and 16nm for the poorer materials.\nLangenscheidt [2] further studied organic solutions, providing a comparison of\nspectra obtained by UV excitation with those obtained from \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3\u2212radiation.\nThe output of the spectrometer was coupled to a photomultiplier cooled to \u221280\u25e6 C,\nthe DC output of which was displayed on a chart recorder. Three radioactive sources\nwere used, a 37MBq 241 Am source providing 5MeV \u03b1-particles, a 19MBq 247 Pm source\nproviding 225keV \u03b2-particles and a 74GBq 192 Ir source providing 0.2\u20131.36MeV \u03b3-rays.\nIn the case of the \u03b2 source, the particle energy was so low that the range in the liquid\nwas only \u223c 0.1mm. The resolution appears to have been around 5nm although, again,\nthis is not directly specified.\nHorrocks [11, 8] used intense pulses of 3MeV electrons derived from a Van de\nGraaff generator. These were typically 3ns long and with beam currents of 400mA.\nThe test samples were organic liquid samples, flame sealed in quartz ampoules so that\n\n\fThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\n4\n\nthey could be held in a vacuum line for exposure to the beam. The light produced was\npassed through a monochromator and onto a photomultiplier, individual pulses being\nrecorded. A resolution of 0.7nm was attained. Problems were encountered both with\nshort term quenching and with long term damage of the scintillator as a result of the\nintense radiation flux.\nPronko et al. [9] developed a system in which intense pulses of 20keV electrons,\nproduced by a simple electron gun, were used to excite plastic scintillator samples held\nin a vacuum line. The light was fed through a spectrometer and onto a photomultiplier.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio was improved by use of a lock-in amplifier which modulated\nthe electron beam. The resolution was 3nm but problems were encountered because the\nelectron beam current was so high that deterioration of the light output of materials\nwas observed.\nMoses et al. [10] designed a facility for the bulk evaluation of novel inorganic\nscintillators using a pulsed X-ray tube. Each 100ps long pulse produced, on average,\n40 X-ray quanta per steradian with a mean energy of 18.5keV. The X-rays excited\ncrystal or powdered inorganic samples and the light from these was monitored\nby a photomultiplier. By placing a monochromator between the sample and the\nphotomultiplier, the emission spectrum of the scintillator could be determined. A\nresolution of 12nm was achieved. The system was limited by the low level of light.\nKirov et al. [12, 13] examined the spectral emission of water-equivalent plastic and\nliquid scintillator solutions. A 1.7GBq 90 Sr/90 Y source was used, providing \u03b2-particles\nof 2.28MeV. The light from the scintillator was fed through a monochromator and onto\na photomultiplier. The output from this was integrated over a few tens of seconds and\nan identical time interval dark background signal was subtracted. The monochromator\naccuracy was measured as 0.8nm though the step size used in actual measurements was\n2.5nm. Both the monochromator and the data acquisition were computer controlled\nallowing the automatic measurement of spectra.\n3. Coincident Photon Counting\nIn the coincident photon counting technique, two photomultipliers are used to increase\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. The arrangement is shown schematically\nin figure 1. One of the photomultipliers, denoted the \"total-event\" tube, views the\nscintillator sample directly, while the other, denoted the \"monochromated\" tube records\nonly photons that have passed through the monochromator. The signal from the\ntotal-event photomultiplier is passed to a discriminator set to trigger at a typical \u03b2particle flash, while the output from the monochromated photomultiplier is passed to\na discriminator set to detect single photons. The coincidence of the two discriminator\noutputs is taken and the rate of coincidences is measured in real time. In this way,\nphotons recorded by the monochromated tube are only counted if they are in coincidence\nwith a scintillation flash recorded by the total-event photomultiplier. This effectively\nsuppresses the single-photon noise of the monochromated photomultiplier.\n\n\f5\n\nThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\nmonochromator\nscintillator sample\n\nratemeter\n\"total-event\"\nphotomultiplier\n\n\u03b2\n\n\"monochromated\"\nphotomultiplier\n\nFigure 1. The experimental setup\n\nThe system was designed to study both liquid and plastic scintillator samples.\nLiquid samples were contained in 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 55mm disposable acrylic cuvettes while\nplastic samples were machined to similar dimensions. The samples were arranged so\nthat \u03b2-particles entered the scintillator from below through the base. The \u03b2-particles\nhad an end-point energy of 2.28MeV and were obtained from a 3.7MBq 90 Sr source. This\nsource was held in a brass collimator consisting of a 50mm long 20mm diameter cylinder\nwith a central cavity. A 1mm diameter axial hole was drilled into this cavity in order to\nprovide a well-defined \u03b2-particle beam with negligible exposure in other directions. The\nsample was arranged so that the volume of scintillator immediately above the base was\naligned with the input slit of the monochromator. The base of the acrylic cuvettes was\n\nFigure 2. Plan view of the arrangement of the sample and PTFE reflectors\n\n1mm thick, so some absorption of \u03b2-particles in the wall could be expected. However, at\n2.27MeV, the range in material of density 1.0 is about 10mm so the attenuation effect\nis negligible. Tests with cuvettes containing only water or pure mineral oil indicated\nthere was no problem with scintillation in the walls of the cuvette. Before liquids were\nmeasured they were sparged with solvent-saturated nitrogen to remove dissolved oxygen.\nThe monochromator was an Applied Photophysics High Radiance Monochromator,\nselected purely on the grounds of availability. Coupled to the output port of the\nmonochromator was an Electron Tubes 9829QA quartz windowed photomultiplier,\nchosen to ensure that the spectral response of the measuring system extended into\n\n\fThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\n6\n\nthe ultraviolet.\nA system of diffuse reflectors fabricated from PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)\nensured that, while as much light as possible entered the input port of the\nmonochromator, some of the light was directed to a second photomultiplier, the \"totalevent\" photomultiplier, here an Electron Tubes 9954KA. This arrangement can be seen\nin plan view in figure 2. For clarity, the radioactive source and its collimator are not\nshown; they are immediately below the sample cuvette.\nThe anode signals of the photomultipliers were both fed to discriminators. The\n\"total-event\" tube had an Ortec 584 with the discriminator set to about 100 photoelectrons while the \"monochromated\" tube had a Mechtronics 511 photon discriminator\nset at about 0.3 times the single photon level. The outputs of the discriminators were\nset to about 50ns width and fed to a LeCroy 466 coincidence unit. The coincidence\noutput was simply counted over 100 second periods with a Racal 9902 counter timer\nand this rate gave a measure of the intensity of the scintillation light at the wavelength\nselected by the monochromator.\nWith the resolution of the monochromator set at 5nm, and typical organic\nscintillators observed at peak wavelength, the rate of coincidences was a few tens per\nsecond. This meant that statistically significant results could be obtained with count\nperiods of 100s per 5nm wavelength bin. A complete spectrum from 360nm to 540nm\nwould take a little over an hour to complete. The system described here was manually\ncontrolled but it would be simple to automate the measurement by motor driving the\nmonochromator. It was also possible to improve the resolution at the expense of longer\ncounting times.\nIn order to determine the relative spectral response of the recording system, tests\nwere performed using light from a quartz-halogen lamp and a mercury vapour lamp.\nThe light from these was attenuated with a series of pinholes and fed through the\nmonochromator and onto the quartz window of the photomultiplier. For these tests, the\nsingle-photon count rate was determined directly without a coincidence requirement. By\nvarying the monochromator over the range of interest and comparing the single-photon\nrate with the known spectral emission of the sources, a set of correction curves for\nthe instrumental response of the monochromator and quartz window photomultiplier\nwere obtained. In the case of the mercury vapour lamp, individual emission lines\ncould be discerned, and this provided a check on the wavelength calibration of the\nmonochromator. One series of the correction measurements was performed with\na sample wall from one of the cuvettes inserted between the light source and the\nmonochromator to ensure that the corrections included wall losses.\nWith the photomultiplier used and with the organic scintillators being studied,\nthe correction factors were minor. If the technique were used for materials emitting\nfurther into the ultraviolet or into the green, where the response of the photomultiplier\nis reduced, the accuracy with which the corrections were known would begin to dominate\nthe measurements.\nSince it was clear at an early stage that the coincident photon counting technique\n\n\f7\n\nThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\nprovided excellent signal-to-noise ratio, no effort was made to cool the photomultipliers.\nIndeed, it is not obvious that any improvement to the measurements would be made by\nsuch cooling.\n4. Results\nTo show typical results from the system, spectra from two liquid scintillator samples,\nXLS169A and XLS169C produced by Zinsser Analytic (UK) Ltd., are presented in\nfigure 3.

It can be seen that while the two spectra are similar on the long wavelength\nside, the XLS169C cuts off more sharply on the short wavelength side, presumably\nbecause the mineral oil solvent has lower transparency in the near ultraviolet.\nIt is worth noting that the integral of each curve gives the total amount of light\nemitted over all wavelengths and hence provides a comparative measure of efficiency\nfor the scintillator sample. In the work of Kirov et al. [12], the corrections needed\nfor accurate calculation of the number of photons per unit wavelength are considered\nand a detailed error analysis for estimating the scintillator efficiency from spectral\nmeasurements is given.\n5. Conclusions\nThe coincident photon counting technique is demonstrated as a simple method of\ndetermining scintillator spectral response. It requires only low cost equipment typically\navailable in laboratories where scintillators are studied. The apparatus described uses\n\n\fThe measurement of scintillation emission spectra\n\n8\n\na relatively low activity \u03b2-particle source and organic scintillator samples, but the\ntechnique could easily be extended to use \u03b1 or \u03b3 sources and modified for inorganic\nor even cryogenic scintillators.\nIn the case of ternary organic scintillators, employing a solute and a wavelength\nshifter, care must be taken that the light paths through scintillator are longer than the\nextinction length of the wavelength shifter. If this is not the case, unshifted photons\nwill escape the volume and the measured spectrum will be inaccurate. For a typical\ncommercial plastic scintillator, Bicron BC400/NE-102, this has been measured [14]\nas 120\u03bcm. With the geometry described above and materials with realistic levels of\nwavelength shifter, no problems were encountered.\nIn the case of inorganic scintillators with long decay times and more than one decay\ncomponent, it might be possible to examine changes in spectral output as a function of\ntime by using a short coincidence gate and specifying a time delay from the total-event\ndiscriminator.\nThe system could further be extended to examine the emission spectra of\nwavelength shifter materials by using a radioactive source to excite a scintillator which\nis arranged to illuminate one of the large faces of a rectangular slab of polished acrylic.\nThe wavelength shifter can either be doped into the acrylic or be deposited as a film on\nthe large face. If light from the slab is coupled through one of the small edges into the\nmonochromator, it will be uncontaminated by the original scintillation light spectrum.\nThe coincident photon counting technique described may also be applied to the\nmeasurement of the spectra of any other pulsed light emission such as Cherenkov light,\nplasma or spark discharges.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was developed as part of a Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council\nPIPSS scheme.
