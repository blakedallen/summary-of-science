In the C.A.G.D. context, one has a good example of\nthis phenomenon in the family of offset curves to a given curve (see [3], [11],\n[14], [15]), where the parameter is the offsetting distance. Take for example\nthe well-known case of the offset to the parabola (see [6]). In this case three\ndifferent shapes, which can be seen in Figure 1 (together with the original\nparabola, in thinner line), arise; here, one may observe that for distances\nd < 1/2, the offsets show no cusps, but they exhibit an isolated point (i.e.\na geometric extraneous component), and that for d > 1/2, two cusps and a\nself-intersection arise.\nEmail address: juange.alcazar@uah.es (Juan Gerardo Alcazar).\nAuthor supported by the Spanish Supported \" Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion\"\nunder the Project MTM2008-04699-C03-01.\n1\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\n31 May 2018\n\n\fFig. 1. Topology types of the offsets to y 2 \u2212 x = 0: d < 1/2 (left); d = 1/2 (center);\nd > 1/2 (right)\n\n. In the middle of each figure, the parabola has been also plotted.\nThe problem of computing the different shapes arising in a family of algebraic\ncurves depending on a parameter has been considered in [1], [12], under different perspectives but reaching similar results, for the case when the family\nis implicitly given; so, in these papers the family to be analyzed is defined\nas the zero set of a polynomial F (x, y, \u03bb), where \u03bb is regarded as a real parameter. In particular, using the result in [1], the topology types in Figure 1\ncan be determined. For this purpose, the strategy is the following. First, one\ncomputes a finite set A so that in between two consecutive elements of A, the\ntopology type of the family does not change; we refer to such a set as a critical\nset; in the case of the offset to the parabola, A = {1/2}. Then, this critical\nset induces a finite partition of the parameter space; in the above example,\nthe partition is (0, 1/2), {1/2}, (1/2, \u221e) (notice that the offsetting distance\nis a positive real number). Finally, taking a representative for each element of\nthe partition, and applying if necessary standard methods for describing the\ntopology of a plane algebraic curve (see [5], [8], [9]), the different shapes in\nthe family can be computed.\nIn this paper, starting from the results in [1] we address the same problem but\nfor the case, specially interesting in the C.A.G.D. context, of a family F of\nrational curves depending on a parameter, defined in parametric form. Thus,\nour input is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3y\n\n= u(t, \u03bb)\n= v(t, \u03bb)\n\nwhere u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb) are rational functions in terms of t, \u03bb, and \u03bb \u2208 R is a\nparameter. In these conditions, we consider the computation of a critical set\nof F , but without computing or making use of the implicit equation of the\nfamily. So, the main result of the paper is an algorithm for carrying out this\ncomputation.\nThe algorithm is advantageous when a rational parametrization of the family\nto be analyzed is available. In fact, in our experimentation we have found\n2\n\n\fseveral examples (see the comparison table in Subsection 4.3) of families that\nare hard to study with the result in [1] (i.e. the computations are too heavy in\nimplicit form), but which can be analyzed with the algorithm provided here.\nThe algorithm is based on a geometrical interpretation of the results in [1].\nThis interpretation suggests a certain geometrical process to be performed\nin order to compute a critical set. Hence, the question is to carry out that\nprocess in parametric form. The geometric analysis of the main results in\n[1] can be found in Section 2. In Section 3, we show how to check different\nhypotheses that we impose on the parametrization, and how to \"prepare\" the\nfamily before applying the algorithm; the ideas in this section are illustrated\nin Example 1, where the offset family to a cardioid is considered. In Section\n4, we provide the full algorithm, we complete the analysis of Example 1, and\nwe give a comparison table showing the timings of our algorithm, compared\nto those corresponding to the algorithm in [1]; these timings show that our\nalgorithm yields in general better results than the known algorithm for the\nimplicit case. Finally, in Section 5 we present the conclusions of our study.\nThe parametrizations used for comparing timings are given in Appendix I.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries.\n\n2.1 Known Results for the Implicit Case.\n\nLet F \u2208 R[x, y, \u03bb]. For all \u03bb0 \u2208 R such that F (x, y, \u03bb0) is not identically 0\nwe have that F (x, y, \u03bb0) = F\u03bb0 (x, y) defines an algebraic curve. So, we can\nsay that F defines a family F of algebraic curves algebraically depending on\nthe parameter \u03bb. By Hardt's Semialgebraic Triviality Theorem (see Theorem\n5.46 in [4]), it holds that the number of topology types of F (i.e. the different\nshapes arising in the family as \u03bb0 moves in R) must be finite. Therefore, it\nmakes sense to consider the problem of computing the topology types arising\nin the family. This problem has been addressed in [1], for the case when the\nfamily is implicitly defined. So, in this subsection we recall the main aspects\n(hypotheses, notation, and results) of this paper.\nMore precisely, given F (x, y, \u03bb) one can associate an algebraic surface S with\nthe family F defined by F by substituting \u03bb := z in F ; thus, the members\nof F are the level curves of S, i.e. the sections of S with planes normal to\nthe z-axis. So, the problem of computing the topology types in F can be reinterpreted as the computation of the topology types arising in the family of\nlevel curves of S. This is exactly the question addressed in [1]. In order to\nsolve this problem, in [1] the following definition is introduced.\n\n3\n\n\fDefinition 1 Let S be an algebraic surface. We say that A \u2282 R is a critical\nset of S, if it is finite and it contains all the z-values where the topology type\nof the level curves of S changes; i.e., if the topology type of the level curves of\nS stays invariant along any interval delineated by two consecutive elements of\nA.\nWe speak about the critical set of F , to mean the critical set of the surface\nassociated with the family. Notice that if a critical set A = {a1 , . . . , ar } is\ncomputed, then the parameter space (R, in this case) can be decomposed as\n(\u2212\u221e, a1 ) \u222a {a1 } \u222a (a1 , a2 ) \u222a * * * \u222a {ar } \u222a (ar , +\u221e)\nThen, taking a representative for each element of the above partition, and\napplying standard methods ([5], [8], [9]) for describing the topology of an algebraic curve, the topology types in the family can be computed. Hence, the\ncrucial question is the computation of a critical set. This is the problem addressed in [1]. In the rest of the subsection, we recall the hypotheses, notation\n(that we will also follow here) and main result of [1].\nHypotheses: The hypotheses imposed in [1] on the surface S to be analyzed,\nare: (a) F is square-free, and depends on the variable y; (b) F does not contain\nany factor only depending on the variable z (i.e. S has no component normal\nto the z-axis); (c) the leading coefficient of F w.r.t. the variable y, does not\ndepend on x.\n\u221a\nNotation: Given a polynomial G, G denotes the square-free part of G, i.e.\nthe product of all the irreducible factors of G taken with multiplicity 1. Also,\nDw (G) denotes the discriminant of G with respect to the variable w, i.e. the\nresultant of G and its partial derivative with respect to w. We write this\nresultant as Dw (G) = Resw (G, \u2202G\n). Furthermore, the following polynomials\n\u2202w\nare introduced:\nM(x, z) :=\n\nq\n\nDy (F ) , R(z) :=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n0\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 Dx (M(x, z))\n\nif degx (M) = 0\notherwise\n\nResult: the main result of [1] is the following (see Theorem 4 and Theorem 13\nin [1]):\nTheorem 2 Let S be an algebraic surface implicitly defined by F \u2208 R[x, y, z],\nfulfilling the above hypotheses. Then the following statements hold:\n(1) If R is not identically zero, then the set of real roots of R is a critical set\nof S. If R has no real roots, then the elements of the family show just one\ntopology type.\n4\n\n\f(2) If R is identically zero, then M = M(z), and the set of real roots of M is a\ncritical set of S.\n\n2.2 Geometrical interpretation of the results for the implicit case.\n\nLet us provide a geometrical interpretation of the process, according to Theorem 2, giving rise to a critical set of S. For this purpose, let C = V (F, Fy )\nbe the algebraic variety defined by F and its partial derivative Fy (i.e. the\nintersection of the surfaces defined by F and Fy , respectively). Under the assumptions made on S, one may check that gcd(F, Fy ) = 1; so, C has dimension\n1, i.e. it is a space algebraic curve. Taking into account that the normal direction to the surface S at each point P \u2208 S is defined by the gradient vector\n\u2207F (P ) = (Fx (P ), Fy (P ), Fz (P )), one may see that C consists of the points\nof S where the normal vector is either parallel to the xz-plane, or identically\nzero (i.e. singularities of S). Also, let us denote the curve defined by the polynomial M(x, z) on the xz-plane, as M. Now, from a geometric point of view,\nin order to compute a critical set by means of Theorem 2, one has to perform\ntwo different phases:\n(1) Computation of M (Projection Phase): from basic properties of resultants\n(see for example p. 255 in [18]), one may see that the curve M consists of\nthe projection onto the xz-plane of C, together with the curve defined by the\nleading coefficient w.r.t. y of F , denoted as lcoeff y (F ); since by hypothesis\nlcoeff y (F ) does not depend on x, this last curve consists of finitely many\nlines z \u2212 z0 = 0 where z0 is a root of lcoeff y (F ).\n(2) Computation of the critical set (Analysis of the Projection): the following real\nz-values must be computed:\n(i) the z-coordinates of the points of M with tangent parallel to the x-axis\n(included the values za 's so that z \u2212 za is a component of M).\n(ii) the z-coordinates of the singularities of M\n(iii) the values zb 's so that z \u2212 zb is a horizontal asymptote of M\nIn the case M = M(z) this is clear. In other case, one must notice that\nfrom well-known properties of resultants (again, p. 255 in [18]), the roots\nof Resx (M, Mx ) correspond either to the z-coordinates of the solutions of\nthe polynomial system {M(x, z) = 0, Mx (x, z) = 0}, or to the roots of\nlcoeff x (M). Then, it suffices to interpret the solutions of the system, and\nthe real roots of lcoeff x (M), from a geometric point of view.\nIn the rest of the paper, we will refer to these z-values as (1)-values, (2)-values\nand (3)-values, respectively.\n5\n\n\f2.3 Notation and Hypotheses for the parametric case\n\nIn the rest of the paper, let F be a family of rational algebraic curves, algebraically depending on a parameter \u03bb, defined by the parametric equations\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3y\n\n= u(t, \u03bb)\n= v(t, \u03bb)\n\nwhere u, v are real, rational functions of the variables t, \u03bb in reduced form\n(i.e. the numerator and denominator of u, v share no common factor), not\nidentically 0. Thus, for almost all real values of \u03bb the above equations define a\nrational curve of parameter t. In fact, the only exceptions are the values of \u03bb\ncausing that some denominator of u, v vanishes. Now our purpose is to study\nthe topology types arising in F as \u03bb moves in R. In our approach, the key for\ncomputing these topology types is the computation of a finite partition of R\nso that for each element of the partition, the topology type of the family stays\ninvariant. Hence, in the sequel we focus on this question. For this purpose,\nobserve that the equations\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\ny\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n= u(t, \u03bb)\n= v(t, \u03bb)\n\nz=\u03bb\n\ndefine a rational surface S in parametric form, whose level curves are exactly\nthe members of the family F . Hence, our aim is the computation of a critical\nset of S. For this purpose, we introduce the following notation:\n\u2022 \u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) is the parametrization of the family F . Hence, the\nassociated surface S is defined by the parametrization (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb), \u03bb).\n\u2022 F\u03bb (x, y) = F (x, y, \u03bb) defines the implicit equation of F . Hence, the implicit\nequation of S is F (x, y, z) = 0.\nNow in order to make precise the hypotheses that we require on the family\nF , we need to recall the notion of proper parametrization. One says that a\nparametrization \u03c6(t) of a rational curve H is proper, if there are just finitely\nmany points of H generated simultaneously by several different values of the\nparameter t; intuitively speaking, this means that the curve is traced just once\nas t moves in R. The interested reader may find more information on this topic\nin Chapter 4.2 of [18]. Then, we consider the following hypotheses:\n6\n\n\fHypotheses:\n(H1 ) The parametrization \u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) is proper for almost all values\nof \u03bb (i.e. there are just finitely many values of \u03bb such that \u03c6\u03bb (t) is not\nproper).\n(H2 ) degy (F\u03bb ) = deg(F\u03bb ), i.e. considering F\u03bb as a polynomial in the variables\nx, y, the degree of F\u03bb w.r.t. the variable y equals the total degree of F\u03bb ;\nin particular, the leading coefficient of F\u03bb w.r.t. y does not depend on x,\nthough it may depend on \u03bb.\n(H3 ) The function u(t, \u03bb) depends on the variable t.\nIn the following, we will refer to these hypotheses as (H1 ) and (H2 ), respectively. Observe that (H2 ) is slightly more restrictive than the hypothesis (c)\nrequired in the implicit case. On the other hand, (H3 ) guarantees that F\u03bb\n(and therefore F ) depends on the variable y. Notice that if (H3 ) does not\nhold, the analysis is reduced to the family x = u(\u03bb) (consisting just of finitely\nmany lines normal to the x-axis), and the problem is trivial. Finally, since S\nis a rational surface then it is irreducible; in particular, S cannot represent a\nplane normal to the z-axis because from the parametrization it is clear that\nthe z-coordinate cannot be constant. Thus, whenever the above hypotheses\nhold, the surface S described by the considered parametrization satisfies all\nthe hypotheses required in the implicit version of the problem.\nThe problem of checking the above hypotheses (H1 ) and (H2 ) is addressed in\nthe next section. Checking (H3 ) is trivial; so, in the sequel we assume that\n(H3 ) holds.\n\n3\n\nChecking Hypotheses\n\nIn this section we provide an algorithm for checking the hypotheses (H1 ) and\n(H2 ) introduced in Subsection 2.3. In addition, the algorithm addressed here\nprovides also a list of finitely many \"special\" values of the parameter \u03bb, which\nwill be important (see the next section) in order to compute a critical set of\nthe surface S associated with the family.\n\n3.1 Checking hypothesis (H1 )\nIn this subsection we consider the problem of checking whether (H1 ) holds, or\nnot. For this purpose, we start with a technical lemma on the behavior of the\ngcd of two polynomials of R[x, y, \u03bb], under the specialization of the parameter\n\u03bb. Hence, let \u03c6a be the natural homomorphism of R[x, y, \u03bb] into R[x, y], i.e. for\n7\n\n\fa \u2208 R,\n\u03c6a : R[x, y, \u03bb] \u2192 R[x, y]\nf (x, y, \u03bb) \u2192 \u03c6a (f ) = f (x, y, a)\nMoreover, if f, g \u2208 R[x, y, \u03bb], we write f = f \u0304 * gcd(f, g), g = \u1e21 * gcd(f, g), and\nwe define the following sets:\n(x,y)\n\nB1\n\n(f, g) = {a \u2208 R|\u03c6a (lcoeffx (f )) = 0 or \u03c6a (lcoeffx (g)) = 0}\n\nB2\n\n(f, g) = {a \u2208 R|\u03c6a (lcoeffy (f )) = 0 or \u03c6a (lcoeffy (g)) = 0}\n\n(x,y)\n\n(x,y)\n\nB3\n\n(x,y)\n\nB4\n\n(f, g) = {a \u2208 R|\u03c6a Resx (f \u0304, \u1e21) } = 0\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(f, g) = {a \u2208 R|\u03c6a Resy (f \u0304, \u1e21) } = 0\n\u0010\n\nB(f, g) = B1 \u222a B2 \u222a B3 \u222a B4\n\n\u0011\n\nThen the following lemma holds.\nLemma 3 Let f, g \u2208 R[x, y, \u03bb]. Then, for all a \u2208\n/ B(f, g), it holds that gcd(\u03c6a (f ), \u03c6a (g)) =\n\u03c6a (gcd(f, g)).\nProof. Writing f = h\u0304 * h, g = \u1e21 * h, it holds that\ngcd(\u03c6a (f ), \u03c6a (g)) = gcd(\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) * \u03c6a (h)\nSo, we have to prove that for a \u2208\n/ B(f, g), gcd(\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) = 1. Indeed, if this\nequality does not hold then either Resx (\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) = 0 or Resy (\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) =\n0. On the other hand, since a \u2208\n/ B(f, g) then the resultants behave well under\nspecializations (see Lemma 4.3.1 in [21]), and hence Resx (\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) = 0\n(resp. Resy (\u03c6a (f \u0304), \u03c6a (\u1e21)) = 0) iff \u03c6a (Resx (f \u0304, \u1e21)) = 0 (resp. \u03c6a (Resy (f \u0304, \u1e21)) =\n0). Nevertheless, \u03c6a (Resx (f \u0304, \u1e21)) = 0 (resp. \u03c6a (Resy (f \u0304, \u1e21)) = 0) cannot happen\nbecause a \u2208\n/ B(f, g).\nNow we fix the following notation:\n\u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) =\n\n!\n\nX11 (t, \u03bb) X21 (t, \u03bb)\n,\n,\nX12 (t, \u03bb) X22 (t, \u03bb)\n\nand we introduce the following polynomials:\nG\u03c61 (t, s, \u03bb) = X11 (t, \u03bb) * X12 (s, \u03bb) \u2212 X12 (t, \u03bb) * X11 (s, \u03bb)\n\nG\u03c62 (t, s, \u03bb) = X21 (t, \u03bb) * X22 (s, \u03bb) \u2212 X22 (t, \u03bb) * X21 (s, \u03bb)\n8\n\n\fMoreover, we write G\u03c61 = \u1e20\u03c61 * gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ), G\u03c62 = \u1e20\u03c62 * gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ), and we\ndenote:\n(t,s)\n\nD1 = B1\n\n(t,s)\n\nD3 = B3\n\n(t,s)\n\n(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )\n\n(t,s)\n\n(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )\n\n(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ), D2 = B2\n\n(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ), D4 = B4\n\nD = D1 \u222a D2 \u222a D3 \u222a D4 ,\n(notice that D1 = D2 , D3 = D4 because G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 are symmetric w.r.t. t, s).\nThen, the following theorem holds. Here, we denote the evaluations of G\u03c61 , G\u03c62\nat \u03bb = a, as \u03c6a (G\u03c61 ), \u03c6a (G\u03c62 ), respectively.\nTheorem 4 The parametrization \u03c6\u03bb (t) is proper for almost all values of \u03bb iff\ndegt (gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )) = 1, i.e. iff gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ) = t \u2212 s (maybe multiplied by some\npolynomial \u03b1(\u03bb) \u2208 R[\u03bb]). Furthermore, if this condition holds, then the only\nvalues of \u03bb where \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be proper, are those in D.\nProof. Let a \u2208 R. By Theorem 4.30 in [18], \u03c6a (t) is proper iff\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\ndegt gcd \u03c6a (G\u03c61 ), \u03c6a (G\u03c62 )\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n= 1.\n\nHowever, by Lemma 3, if a \u2208\n/ D then\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\ngcd \u03c6a (G\u03c61 ), \u03c6a (G\u03c62 ) = \u03c6a gcd G\u03c61 , G\u03c62\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\nHence, if we prove that\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\ndegt \u03c6a gcd G\u03c61 , G\u03c62\n\n\u0011\u0011\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n= degt gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )\n\n\u0011\n\nfor a \u2208\n/ D, then we have finished. Indeed, if this equality does not hold, then\nthe leading coefficient w.r.t. t of gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ) vanishes at \u03bb = a. However, in\nthat case the leading coefficients of G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 w.r.t. t both vanish at \u03bb = a, and\nthis cannot happen because a \u2208\n/ D. Finally, notice that t \u2212 s always divides\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\ngcd(G1 , G2 ); hence, degt (gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )) = 1 iff gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ) = t \u2212 s (perhaps\nmultiplied by some polynomial \u03b1(\u03bb)).\nHence, Theorem 4 gives us an algorithm for checking hypothesis (H1 ). Moreover, if the condition in Theorem 4 holds one can determine the set D, which\ncontains the finitely many values of the parameter where properness fails. If\nthe condition does not hold, one can compute a reparametrization \u03be\u03bb (t) of the\nfamily, proper for almost all values of \u03bb, by applying the reparametrization\n9\n\n\falgorithm in Section 6.1.2, p. 193 of [18]. We give more details in Subsection\n3.4.\nRemark 1 Observe that, if they exist, the \u03bb-values making that the denominator of either u or v is identically 0 belong to D.\n3.2 Checking hypothesis (H2 )\nNow let us consider hypothesis (H2 ). For this purpose, we recall that the\ndegree of a rational function (i.e. of a quotient of polynomials) is defined as the\nmaximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator; furthermore,\nthe degree of a rational parametrization \u03c6(t) = (\u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t)) is defined as the\nmaximum of the degrees of \u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t) (which are rational functions). We also\nrecall the following result from [18] (see Theorem 4.21 in [18]).\nProposition 5 If \u03c6(t) = (\u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t)), where \u03c71 (t) is not identically 0, is\na proper rational parametrization of a curve and f (x, y) = 0 is its implicit\nequation, then degt (\u03c71 (t)) = degy (f )\nMoreover, we also need the following lemma (see for example Section 3 of\n[10]).\nLemma 6 Let f (x, y) implicitly define a plane curve V, let \u03bc \u2208 R, and let\ng\u03bc (x, y) be the implicit equation of the curve that is obtained from V by applying\nthe linear transformation {x = X + \u03bcY, y = Y }. Then, for almost all values\nof \u03bc it holds that degy (g\u03bc ) = deg(g\u03bc ) (here, deg(g\u03bc ) denotes the total degree\nof g\u03bc ).\nNow the following result holds. This theorem provides a method for computing\nthe degree of a rational curve just from its parametrization, without making\nuse of its implicit equation (compare also with Theorem 6 and Theorem 7 in\n[13]).\nTheorem 7 Let \u03c6(t) = (\u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t)) be a proper rational parametrization of\na curve V, where \u03c71 (t) is not identically 0; also let \u03c7\u03bc (t) = \u03c71 (t) \u2212 \u03bc\u03c72 (t),\nwith \u03bc generic. Then, deg(V) = degt (\u03c7\u03bc (t)).\nProof. Let U\u03bc be the curve obtained from V by applying the linear transformation {x = X + \u03bcY, y = Y }. Then, for all values of \u03bc it holds that U\u03bc\nis a rational curve properly parametrized by \u03c6\u0303\u03bc (t) = (\u03c7\u03bc (t), \u03c72 (t)). Now let\ng\u03bc (x, y) be the implicit equation of U\u03bc . Then by Lemma 6, for a generic \u03bc\nit holds that degy (g\u03bc ) = deg(g\u03bc ). Now since the degree of a curve is invariant by linear transformations, we have that deg(V) = deg(g\u03bc ). Finally, since\n\u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t) are not both identically 0, for a generic \u03bc it holds that \u03c7\u03bc (t) is not\n10\n\n\fidentically 0, either; moreover, \u03c6\u0303\u03bc (t) is proper for every \u03bc \u2208 R, and hence by\nProposition 5 we have that degy (g\u03bc ) = degt (\u03c7\u03bc (t)). Therefore the statement\nfollows.\nTheorem 7, together with Proposition 5, provides the following corollary.\nCorollary 8 Let \u03c6(t) = (\u03c71 (t), \u03c72 (t)), where \u03c71 (t) not identically 0, be a\nproper rational parametrization of a curve V, and let f (x, y) = 0 be its implicit\nequation. Also, let \u03c7\u03bc (t) = \u03c71 (t)\u2212\u03bc\u03c72 (t), with \u03bc generic. Then, degt (\u03c71 (t))) =\ndegt (\u03c7\u03bc (t)) iff degy (f ) = deg(f ).\nThen the following characterization of (H2 ) can be deduced.\nCorollary 9 (H2 ) is fulfilled iff, for a generic \u03bc, it holds that degt (u(t, \u03bb)) =\ndegt (u(t, \u03bb) \u2212 \u03bcv(t, \u03bb)). Moreover, the above value provides the degree of F\u03bb ,\nas a polynomial in the variables x, y.\nAlso from [10], one may see that if (H2 ) is not satisfied, almost all changes\nof coordinates of the type {x = X + \u03bcY, y = Y } set the surface properly.\nFurthermore, if (H2 ) is fulfilled, then the following proposition holds.\nProposition 10 Assume that (H2 ) holds, and let m = degt (X11 (t, \u03bb)), n =\ndegt (X12 (t, \u03bb)), a(\u03bb) = lcoeff t (X11 (t, \u03bb)), b(\u03bb) = lcoeff t (X12 (t, \u03bb)). Also, let\n\u03bb0 be a real root of the leading coefficient of F\u03bb (x, y) w.r.t. the variable y, so\nthat: (i) X11 (t, \u03bb0 ) does not vanish identically; (ii) \u03c6\u03bb0 (t) is proper. Then, the\nfollowing statements are true:\n(1) If m > n, then a(\u03bb0 ) = 0.\n(2) If m = n, then a(\u03bb0 ) = b(\u03bb0 ) = 0.\n(3) If m < n, then b(\u03bb0 ) = 0.\nProof. Since by hypothesis (H2 ) holds, if the leading coefficient of F\u03bb (x, y)\nvanishes at \u03bb = \u03bb0 then degy (F\u03bb0 ) < degy (F\u03bb ). Also, because of the required conditions (i) and (ii), Proposition 5 holds and therefore degy (F\u03bb0 ) =\ndegt (\u03c71 (t, \u03bb0 )). Moreover, from Theorem 7 it holds that degy (F\u03bb ) = degt (\u03c71 (t, \u03bb)).\nSo, we deduce that degt (\u03c71 (t, \u03bb0 )) < degt (\u03c71 (t, \u03bb)). The rest follows from the\ndefinition of degree of a rational function.\nNotice that if X11 (t, \u03bb0 ) = 0, then \u03bb0 is an element of the set D in Theorem\n4. Now Proposition 10 provides the following corollary. Here, we keep the\nnotation used in the above proposition.\nCorollary 11 Assume that (H1 ) and (H2 ) are fulfilled. Then, the real roots\nof lcoeff y (F ) belong to the set consisting of the following elements: (i) the real\nelements of the set D in Theorem 4; (ii) the real roots of: (a) a(\u03bb), if m > n;\n(b) b(\u03bb), if m < n; (c) gcd(a(\u03bb), b(\u03bb)), if m = n.\n\n11\n\n\f3.3 Normality\nGiven a parametrization \u03c8(t) of a plane curve E, one says that the parametrization is normal if it is surjective, i.e. if for all P0 \u2208 E there exists t0 \u2208 C so that\n\u03c8(t0 ) = P0 ; notice that t0 may be complex even though P0 is real. This notion\nhas been studied in [2], [17], [18]. For our purposes, here we recall the following\nresult (see Theorem 6.22 in [18]).\n!\n\nX11 (t) X21 (t)\nTheorem 12 Let \u03c6(t) =\nbe a parametrization of a plane\n,\nX12 (t) X22 (t)\ncurve E, and let n = deg(X12 ), s = deg(X22 ). Also, let b\u22c6 = coeff(X11 , n) (i.e.\nthe coefficient of degree n in X11 (t)), b = coeff(X12 , n), d\u22c6 = coeff(X21 , s),\nd = coeff(X22 , s). Then,\n(i) If m > n or r > s, then \u03c6(t) is normal.\n(ii) If m \u2264 n and r \u2264 s, then \u03c6(t) is normal iff\ndegt (gcd (b\u22c6 X12 (t) \u2212 bX11 (t), d\u22c6 X22 (t) \u2212 dX21 (t))) \u2265 1\nMoreover, if \u03c6(t) is not normal, the only point that is !not reached by the\nb\u22c6 d\u22c6\nparametrization is the so-called \"critical point\"\n, which is a point\n,\nb d\nof E.\nIn our case, we deal with the family\n\u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) =\n\n!\n\nX11 (t, \u03bb) X21 (t, \u03bb)\n.\n,\nX12 (t, \u03bb) X22 (t, \u03bb)\n\nHence, from Theorem 12 we can derive the following result:\nTheorem 13 Let m = degt (X11 ), n = degt (X12 ), r = degt (X21 ), s = degt (X22 ).\nAlso, let a(\u03bb) = coeff(X11 (t, \u03bb), m), b\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X11 (t, \u03bb), n), b(\u03bb) = coeff(X12 (t, \u03bb), n),\nc(\u03bb) = coeff(X21 (t, \u03bb), r), d\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X21 (t, \u03bb), s), d(\u03bb) = coeff(X22 (t, \u03bb), s).\nThen, it holds that:\n(i) If m > n and r > s, the values of \u03bb where \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be normal satisfy\ngcd(a(\u03bb), c(\u03bb)) = 0.\n(ii) If m > n and r \u2264 s, the values of \u03bb where \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be normal satisfy\na(\u03bb) = 0.\n(iii) If r > s and m \u2264 s, the values of \u03bb where \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be normal satisfy\nc(\u03bb) = 0.\n(iv) If m \u2264 n, r \u2264 s, and\ndegt (gcd (b\u22c6 (\u03bb)X12 (t) \u2212 b(\u03bb)X11 (t), d\u22c6 (\u03bb)X22 (t) \u2212 d(\u03bb)X21 (t))) \u2265 1,\n12\n\n\fthe values of \u03bb where \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be normal satisfy at least one of the following conditions (here, we denote \u03b7(t, \u03bb) = lcoeff t (b\u22c6 X12 \u2212 bX11 ), \u03bd(t, \u03bb) =\nd\u22c6 X22 \u2212 dX21 , \u03b7\u0303 = \u03b7/ gcd(\u03b7, \u03bd), \u03bd\u0303 = \u03bd/ gcd(\u03b7, \u03bd)): (a) lcoeff t (\u03b7(t, \u03bb)) = 0;\n(b) lcoeff t (\u03bd(t, \u03bb)) = 0; (c) Rest (\u03b7\u0303, \u03bd\u0303) = 0.\n(v) If n \u2264 m, r \u2264 s, the only points of the surface S that may not be reached\nby the parametrization,\nare the points of the space curve Ccrit parametrized\n!\nb\u22c6 (\u03bb) d\u22c6 (\u03bb)\nby\n,\n,\u03bb .\nb(\u03bb) d(\u03bb)\nProof. The statements (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) essentially follow from Theorem\n12. Statement (iv) follows from Theorem 12 and Lemma 4.26 in [18].\n\n3.4 Summary, and an example\nHere we provide the full algorithm for checking the hypotheses (H1 ), (H2 ), required on the family F , and we illustrate it by means of an example. Besides\nchecking (H1 ) and (H2 ), the algorithm also provides a list of finitely many\n'special\" values of the parameter, which will be useful in the next section.\nIf (H1 ) does not hold, then one can use the reparametrization algorithm in\nSection 6.1.2, p. 193 of [18] in the following way (see [18] for further information): (1) let G\u03c6 = gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ); then, choose (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 R2 so that G\u03c6 (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nis not identically 0 (those finitely many \u03bb-values making G\u03c6 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = 0 are\nincorporated to the list of \"special\" values); choose also a, b, c, d \u2208 R so that\nad \u2212 bc 6= 0. (2) Consider the rational function\nR\u03bb (t) =\n\naG\u03c6 (\u03b1, t) + bG\u03c6 (\u03b2, t)\ncG\u03c6 (\u03b1, t) + dG\u03c6 (\u03b2, t)\n\nThen, let r = deg(\u03c6\u03bb )/deg(R\u03bb (t)). In general the value of r has to be discussed upon the value of \u03bb, but it will be constant except for finitely many\n\u03bb-values, which again must be stored in the list of special values. (3) Introduce\na generic rational parametrization Q(t) of degree r (i.e. the generic value of r)\nwith undetermined coefficients. From the equality \u03c6\u03bb (t) = Q(R\u03bb (t)) derive a\nlinear system of equations in the undetermined coefficients, and by solving it\ndetermine Q(t) (in fact Q\u03bb (t)). Notice that this linear system has \u03bb as a parameter, and therefore, again, certain (special) values of the parameter must\nalso be computed (by discussing the system). In the end, the whole process\nyields a reparametrization (depending on \u03bb), and a finite list of special values\nof \u03bb. The correctness of this process follows from Theorem 6.4, p. 191 of [18].\nAlso, if (H2 ) is not satisfied almost all changes of coordinates of the type\n{X = x + \u03bcy, Y = y} set the surface properly; observe that this kind of\ntransformation leaves the z-coordinate invariant, and so the topology of the\n13\n\n\flevel curves of the surface is not changed.\nAlgorithm: (Check) Given a uniparametric family F of rational curves, defined\nby its parametric equations\n\u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) =\n\n!\n\nX11 (t, \u03bb) X21 (t, \u03bb)\n,\n,\nX12 (t, \u03bb) X22 (t, \u03bb)\n\nwhere m = degt (X11 ), n = degt (X12 ), r = degt (X21 ), s = degt (X22 ), and\na(\u03bb) = coeff(X11 (t, \u03bb), m), b\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X11 (t, \u03bb), n), b(\u03bb) = coeff(X12 (t, \u03bb), n),\nc(\u03bb) = coeff(X21 (t, \u03bb), r), d\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X21 (t, \u03bb), s), d(\u03bb) = coeff(X22 (t, \u03bb), s),\nand where \u03bb is a real parameter, the algorithm checks hypotheses (H1 ) and\n(H2 ); moreover, if the hypotheses are satisfied, the algorithm also computes a\nlist Spec of finitely many \"special\" values of \u03bb.\n1.

Here, we consider\nthe parametric equation of the offset family to a cardioid. By using the results in [3], one may check that this offset family is rational; moreover, the\nparametrization used in the example is taken from [16].\nExample 1 Let Od (C) be the offset family to the cardioid (x2 + 4y + y 2 )2 \u2212\n16(x2 +y 2 ) = 0. Then, a parametrization of this family is \u03c6d (t) = (u(t, d), v(t, d)),\nwhere:\n3456t5 \u2212 31104t3 + dt8 \u2212 126dt6 + 10206dt2 \u2212 6561d\nu(t, d) =\n486t4 + 36t6 + 2916t2 + t8 + 6561\n(\u221218)t(864t3 \u2212 16t5 \u2212 1296t + dt6 \u2212 21dt4 \u2212 189dt2 + 729d)\nv(t, d) =\n486t4 + 36t6 + 2916t2 + t8 + 6561\nHere, the parameter d denotes the offsetting distance. So, let us apply the\nalgorithm Check. In step (1), we analyze (H1 ). For this purpose, we compute\nG\u03c61 , G\u03c62 (step 1.1):\nG\u03c61 = (3456t5 \u221231104t3 +dt8 \u2212126dt6 +10206dt2 \u22126561d)(486s4+36s6 +2916s2 +\ns8 + 6561) \u2212 (3456s5 \u2212 31104s3 + ds8 \u2212 126ds6 + 10206ds2 \u2212 6561d)(486t4 +\n36t6 + 2916t2 + t8 + 6561)\nG\u03c62 = \u221218t(864t3 \u2212 16t5 \u2212 1296t + dt6 \u2212 21dt4 \u2212 189dt2 + 729d)(486s4 + 36s6 +\n2916s2 + s8 + 6561) + 18s(864s3 \u2212 16s5 \u2212 1296s + ds6 \u2212 21ds4 \u2212 189ds2 +\n729d)(486t4 + 36t6 + 2916t2 + t8 + 6561)\nThen, we check that gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 ) = t\u2212s, and therefore that degt (gcd(G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 )) =\n1 (step (1.2)); hence, (H1 ) holds, Spec0 := \u2205, and we go to step (1.4). Here,\nwe compute the set D containing the d-values where \u03c6d (t) may not be proper;\n\u03c6\nfor this purpose, we compute the real \u0010roots of: (i) Content\ns (lcoeff(G1 , t)); (ii)\n\u0011\nContents (lcoeff(G\u03c62 , t)); (iii) Contentt Rest (\u1e20\u03c61 , \u1e20\u03c62 ) . In this case, we get that\nContents (lcoeff(G\u03c61 , t)) = 54, Contents (lcoeff(G\u03c62 , t)) = 18, and Rest (\u1e20\u03c61 , \u1e20\u03c62 ) =\nC * d(t2 + 9)44(729d \u2212 1053dt2 \u2212 117dt4 + dt6 + 3456t3 )(\u221232t + dt2 + 9d)2 (with\nC \u2208 N). Hence, it holds that D = {0} and therefore\nSpec1 := {0}.\nNow in step (2), we check (H2 ). For this purpose, in step (2.1) we compute\ndegt (u(t, d)) = 8 and degt (u(t, d) \u2212 \u03bcv(t, d) = 8; since both of them coincide,\nthen (H2 ) holds, and we go to step (2.3). Since m = n = 8, we compute\n15\n\n\fa(d) = d, b(d) = 1, and we determine gcd(a(d), b(d)), which is 1; hence,\nSpec2 := \u2205.\nFinally, in step (3) we consider normality questions. We have that r = 7, s = 8\nand therefore r < s. Since m = n, we go to (3.4) and we compute\n\u03b7(t, d) = d(486t4 + 36t6 + 2916t2 + t8 + 6561) \u2212 3456t5 + 31104t3 \u2212 dt8 + 126dt6\n\u221210206dt2 + 6561d\n\n\u03bd(t, d) = 18dt(864t3 \u2212 16t5 \u2212 1296t + dt6 \u2212 21dt4 \u2212 189dt2 + 729d)\n\u03b4 = degt (gcd(\u03b7, \u03bd))\nWe get \u03b4 = 0; hence, we go to step (3.4.2) and we obtain a space curve of\npossibly non-reached points, namely\nCcrit = (d, 0, d)\nFinally, we get that Spec := {0}.\n\n4\n\nThe algorithm for the parametric case.\n\nBased on the observations made in Subsection 2.2, in this section we present\nan algorithm for computing a critical set of S, under the assumption that\nthe hypotheses requested in Subsection 2.3 are satisfied; the algorithm does\nnot compute or make use of the implicit equation of F . More precisely, in\nSubsection 2.2 it is observed that one can compute a critical set of S by\ndetermining certain z-values referred to as (1)-values, (2)-values and (3)-values,\nrespectively. These values have different geometric meanings, and are related\nto notable points and q\nlines of the curve M defined in the xz-plane by the\npolynomial M(x, z) = Dy (F ), where F is the implicit equation of S. On the\nother hand, also in Subsection 2.2 it is shown that M can be written as the\nunion of the projection onto the xz-plane of the space curve C = V (F, Fy ),\nand the curve (in the xz-plane) defined by lcoeff y (F ). Now, the real roots of\nlcoeff y (F ) (or, more precisely, a finite set containing them) can be determined\nby means of Corollary 11, without explicitly computing F . Hence, in this\nsection we focus on the computation of the remaining (1), (2) and (3)-values,\nwhich are related to C; for this purpose, and since we do not want to compute\nor make use of F , the idea is to work with a \"parametric description\" of C.\n16\n\n\fIn order to provide equations for C, one may see (recall the first paragraph in\nSubsection 2.2) that this curve consists of the following points:\n\u2022 points of S, reached by the parametrization, such that the normal vector to\nS is either ~0 (in which case the point is a singularity of S), or parallel to\nthe xz plane.\n\u2022 self-intersections of S, reached by the parametrization.\n\u2022 points of S with some of the above geometric properties, but not reached\nby the parametrization.\nIn the sequel we will refer to these sets as first, second and third sets, respectively. Notice that some of these sets may be empty, and that they are not\nnecessarily disjoint. So, we start with the first one. By performing easy computations with the parametrization (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb), \u03bb) of S, one may see that\nthe expression of the normal vector to S is:\n~ = vt~i \u2212 ut~j + (ut v\u03bb \u2212 u\u03bb vt )~k\nN\nHence, we define C1 as the following subset of points (x, y, z) \u2208 C3 :\n\nC1 \u2261\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx = u(t, \u03bb)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ny = v(t, \u03bb)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz=\u03bb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nh(t, \u03bb) = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 X12 (t, z) * X22 (t, z)\n\n,\n\n6= 0\n\nwhere h(t, \u03bb) is the square-free part of the numerator of ut (t, \u03bb). One may\nsee that C1 contains the first set. Then let us consider the second set (i.e.\nself-intersections of S). For this purpose, we impose\nu(t, \u03bb) = u(s, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb) = v(s, \u03bb), with t 6= s\nHence, we find again the polynomials G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 introduced in Subsection 3.1.\nWe recall from Subsection 3.1 the notation \u1e20\u03c61 , \u1e20\u03c62 for the polynomials obtained by removing\nthe common factor t \u2212 s in G\u03c61 , G\u03c62 . Furthermore, we write\nq\nj(t, \u03bb) = Ress (\u1e20\u03c61 , \u1e20\u03c62 ). Since by hypothesis the parametrization \u03c6\u03bb (t) =\n(u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb), \u03bb) is proper for almost all values of \u03bb, then j(t, \u03bb) cannot be\nidentically 0 (see Theorem 4.30 in [18]). Therefore, we define C2 as the following\n17\n\n\fsubset of points (x, y, z) \u2208 C3 :\n\nC2 \u2261\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx = u(t, \u03bb)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 y = v(t, \u03bb)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz=\u03bb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nj(t, \u03bb) = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 X12 (t, z) * X22 (t, z)\n\n6= 0\n\nOne may see that this set contains the self-intersections of S reached by the\nparametrization. Finally, the third set of points has been studied in Subsection\n3.3. In this sense, by Theorem 13 we have basically two possibilities: in the first\ncase (see statements (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) in Theorem 13), there exists a finite set\nN containing the \u03bb-values so that \u03c6\u03bb (t) may not be normal; in that situation,\nwe just add N to the rest of elements of the critical set, and therefore no\nspecial difficulty arises. In the second case (statement (v) of Theorem 13),\nit may happen that there are infinitely many \u03bb values so that \u03c6\u03bb (t) is not\nnormal; thus, the non-reached points of S are! among the points of the space\nb\u22c6 (\u03bb) d\u22c6 (\u03bb)\ncurve Ccrit parametrized by\n,\n, \u03bb . Hence, in the sequel we will\nb(\u03bb) d(\u03bb)\nassume that we are in this more complicated situation.\n4.1 Computation of a critical set\nSince the roots of lcoeff y (F ) can de determined from Corollary 11, we focus\non the remaining elements of the critical set. For this purpose, we need to\nanalyze the projection of C onto the xz-plane. From the above reasonings, we\ncan write\nC \u2282 C1 \u222a C2 \u222a Ccrit\nSo, \u03c0xz (C) \u2282 \u03c0xz (C1 ) \u222a \u03c0xz (C2 ) \u222a \u03c0xz (Ccrit ). Now we have that\n\n\u03c0xz (C1 ) \u2261\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n= u(t, z)\n\nh(t, z)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n=0\n\nX12 (t, z) * X22 (t, z) 6= 0\n\nLet f (x, t, z) be the numerator of x \u2212 u(t, z). Also, we writeqh = h\u0303 * gcd(h, X12 *\nX22 ). Then, we denote the curve defined by m(1) (x, z) = Rest (f, h\u0303) as M1 ;\n18\n\n\fnotice that m(1) (x, z) cannot be identically 0 because by hypothesis the function u(t, \u03bb) is given in reduced form (i.e. its numerator and denominator share\nno common factor). Furthermore, one may see that \u03c0xz (C1 ) is included in M1 .\nSimilarly,\n\n\u03c0xz (C2 ) \u2261\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nx\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n= u(t, z)\n\nj(t, z) = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 X12 (t, z) * X22 (t, z)\n\n6= 0\n\n(2)\nIn\nq this case, we write j = j\u0303 * gcd(h, X12 * X22 ), we denote m (x, z) =\nRest (f, j\u0303) (which cannot be identically 0 for the same reason than m(1) (x, z)),\nand we represent the curve defined by m(2) as M2 . One may observe that\n\u03c0xz (C2 ) is included\nin M2 . Finally, \u03c0xz (Ccrit ) is the parametric curve defined\n!\nb\u22c6 (\u03bb)\n,\u03bb .\nby\nb(\u03bb)\n\nNow, the z-coordinates of the singularities and of the points with tangent\nparallel to the x-axis of M1 (resp. M2 ), and also the values za so that z \u2212\nza is a horizontal asymptote of M1 (resp. M2 ), correspond to real roots of\n(2)\n(2)\nResx (m(1) , m(1)\nx ) (resp. Resx (m\n! , mx )). On the other hand, since \u03c0xz (Ccrit )\n\u22c6\nb (\u03bb)\nis parametrized by\n, \u03bb , it has no point with tangent parallel to the\nb(\u03bb)\nx-axis, no singularity, and no component parallel to the x-axis. However, it\nmay have horizontal asymptotes, corresponding to the roots of b(\u03bb).\nFinally, in order to compute a critical set we also need to determine the intersections between M1 and M2 , M1 and \u03c0xz (Ccrit ), M2 and \u03c0xz (Ccrit ), respectively. In the first case, let\nm(1) = m(1) / gcd(m(1) , m(2) ), m(2) = m(2) / gcd(m(1) , m(2) );\nthen, the z-coordinates of the intersections between M1 and M2 are contained\nin the set of roots of Resx (m(1) , m(2) ). In the second (resp. the third) case, we\nsimply compute the roots of the numerator M (1) (z) (resp. M (2) (z)) where\nb\u22c6 (\u03bb)\n,\nM (1) (z) (resp. M (2) (z)) is defined as the result of substituting x :=\nb(\u03bb)\nz := \u03bb in m(1) (x, z) (resp. m(2) (x, z)), whenever this substitution does not\nyield 0, and is defined as 1 in other case.\nSo, we can derive the following algorithm for computing a critical set of F .\nHere, we will use the subset Spec computed by the algorithm Check, that we\ndeveloped in Section 3.\n19\n\n\fAlgorithm: (Critical) Given a uniparametric family F of rational curves depending on a parameter \u03bb, defined by its parametric equations\n\u03c6\u03bb (t) = (u(t, \u03bb), v(t, \u03bb)) =\n\n!\n\nX11 (t, \u03bb) X21 (t, \u03bb)\n,\n,\nX12 (t, \u03bb) X22 (t, \u03bb)\n\nfulfilling hypotheses (H1 ), (H2 ), (H3 ), where m = degt (X11 ), n = degt (X12 ),\nr = degt (X21 ), s = degt (X22 ), and b\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X11 (t, \u03bb), n), b(\u03bb) = coeff(X12 (t, \u03bb), n),\nd\u22c6 (\u03bb) = coeff(X21 (t, \u03bb), s), d(\u03bb) = coeff(X22 (t, \u03bb), s), the algorithm computes\na critical set A of the family.\n(1) Compute the set A1 consisting of the real roots of the following polynomials:\n* Resx (m(1) , m(1)\nx )\n(2)\n* Resx (m , m(2)\nx ).\n* Resx (m(1) , m(2) ).\n(2) If m > n, or r > s, or m \u2264 n, r \u2264 s but\ndegt (gcd(b\u22c6 (\u03bb)X12 (t) \u2212 b(\u03bb)X11 (t), c(\u03bb)X22 (t) \u2212 d(\u03bb)X21 (t))) \u2265 1,\nthen A2 = \u2205. Otherwise, let A2 be the set consisting of the real roots of the\nfollowing polynomials:\n* b(\u03bb).\n* M (1) (z)\n* M (2) (z)\n(3) Let A = Spec \u222a A1 \u222a A2 . Return A.\n4.2 Correctness of the Algorithm\nThe aim of this subsection is to prove that the algorithm Critical, provided\nin the above subsection, is correct, i.e. that the set A determined by the\nalgorithm is a critical set of S. The necessity of this proof is due to the fact\nthat in Critical we are working not really with \u03c0xz (C), but with the curve\nM\u22c6 = M1 \u222a M2 \u222a \u03c0xz (Ccrit ), which in general may be bigger than \u03c0xz (C).\nHence, we want to ensure that no critical value (i.e. no \u03bb-value where the\ntopology of the family changes) has been missed when passing from \u03c0xz (C) to\nM\u22c6 . This is done in the following theorem.\nTheorem 14 The algorithm Critical is correct.\nProof. Since \u03c0xz (C) \u2282 M\u22c6 , from Chapter 3, Section 2.5, Exercise 5 of [20] it\nfollows that the singularities of \u03c0xz (C) are also singularities of M\u22c6 , and hence\ntheir z-coordinates are found by the algorithm. Now, let Q \u2208 \u03c0xz (C) so that\nthe tangent line l to \u03c0xz (C) at Q is parallel to the x-axis. If Q is a regular point\nof M\u22c6 , since \u03c0xz (C) \u2282 M\u22c6 we have that l is also the tangent line to M\u22c6 at\n20\n\n\fQ; therefore Q is a point of M\u22c6 with tangent parallel to the x-axis, and hence\nits z-coordinate is found by the algorithm. Otherwise, Q is a singular point\nof M\u22c6 and therefore its z-coordinate is also determined by the algorithm. On\nthe other hand, asymptotic branches of \u03c0xz (C) and components lying in planes\nnormal to the z-axis, keep their nature when passing to M\u22c6 . Finally, since the\nreal roots of lcoeff y (F ) are included in Spec, we conclude that all the (1), (2)\nand (3)-values are computed by Critical, and the result follows.\nRemark 2 Notice that we are stating that the set computed by the algorithm\nCritical is a critical set, i.e. that it contains all the \u03bb-values where the topology type of the family may change. But we are not stating that the set that\nwe are computing is optimal. So, the output of the algorithm may include\nadditional z-values where the topology of the family does not change. This\ndrawback was already present in the algorithm of [1], which was not optimal,\neither. However, our algorithm may yield critical sets which are bigger than\nthose in [1]. Since affine transformations preserve the topology of curves, one\ncan recognize some superfluous values in a computed critical set in the following way: (1) apply a random affine transformation {X = x+\u03bcy, Y = y} to the\nfamily; (2) compute a critical set of the new family; (3) discard those values\nof the original critical set that do not belong to the new critical set.\n\n4.3 Experimentation and Results\n\nThe algorithm Critical has been implemented in Maple, and tested with\nseveral examples. In this subsection, first we continue the analysis of the topology types in the offset family to the cardioid, started in Example 1. Then we\nprovide a simple example illustrating the non-optimality of the algorithm, as\nmentioned in Remark 2. Finally we present a table comparing timings between\nthe algorithm for the implicit case, deducible from [1], and our algorithm.\nExample 1 (continued): By applying the algorithm Critical, one determines the following critical set:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA = {\u221216/3, \u2212\u03b1, \u22123 3, \u22128 3/3, \u22123 3/2, 0, 3 3/2, 8 3/3, 3 3, \u03b1, 16/3}\n(which coincides with the output of the implicit algorithm), where \u03b1 is the\nreal root of 729\u03bb5 \u2212 1215\u03bb4 + 702\u03bb3 \u2212 18\u03bb2 + 13\u03bb \u2212 27. The total amount of\ntime required for this computation was 1.5 seconds (the cost of checking the\nhypotheses is included). From this critical set, one may deduce that there are at\nmost 19 different topology types in the family. However, by applying a random\nlinear transformation as suggested in Remark 2, one can compute a reduced\n21\n\n\fcritical set, namely\n\u221a\n\u221a\n{\u221216/3, \u22123 3, 0, 3 3, 16/3}\nIn this case, because of the properties of offset curves, one has that for d = 0\none gets the original curve, i.e. a cardioid, and that for d0 and \u2212d0 , the shape\nis the same. So, in our analysis we have just considered positive values of d.\nIn Figure 2 one may find the different shapes arising in the family, and the\nintervals corresponding to each of them. In the first row (at the top of the\nfigure), we display the pictures (i), (ii), (iii) corresponding to the distances\nd = \u221a1, d = 3, d = 22/5, respectively, all of them belonging to the interval\n(0, 3 3/2) and therefore sharing the same topology type (we have plotted the\nthree pictures so as to clearly see the evolution of the family, as d is increased).\nIn the\u221asecond row, from left to right we have the picture (iv)\n\u221a corresponding to\nd = 3 3, the picture (v) corresponding to a distance d \u2208 (3 3, 16/3), and (vi),\nthat corresponds to d = 16/3. In the third row, the shape (vii) corresponding\nto d > 16/3 is shown. Also, in each figure we have included the plotting of\u221athe\noriginal cardioid. One may see that the offsets exhibit two cusps for d < 3 3,\nand a loop for d \u2265 16/3. However, the topologies of (iv) and (v) are not\ncompletely clear, since the picture does not show well enough the behavior\nnext to the singularity with negative y-coordinate. If one enlarges the part of\nthe curve next to this singularity, one obtains the pictures in Figure 3. Here\nwe have plotted a detail of (iv) (left), of (v) (middle), and of (vi) (right). So,\nin (iv) there is a non-ordinary singularity; in (v) there is not one, but two\nsingularities, corresponding to two self-intersections of the curve, giving rise\nto two different loops; in (vi), the topology changes so that the curve has only\none loop (the origin, in this case, is a singular point).\nExample 2: Consider the family \u03c6d (t) = (u(t, d), v(t, d)), where:\nu(t, d) = \u221225 + 11t2 \u2212 29t + d(57 \u2212 95t2 \u2212 22t)\nv(t, d) = 49 + 18t2 + 51t + d(70 + 34t2 \u2212 64t)\n\nThe implicit equation of the family is 1136239 \u2212 393995d \u2212 19629x \u2212 53165y +\n202885dx+130530992d3\u22121200232d2x+374269dy\u22122090dy 2+121y 2+59360320d4+\n324x2 \u2212 396yx \u2212 33513124d2 + 1156d2x2 + 1224dx2 \u2212 688992d2y \u2212 1781936yd3 +\n9025d2y 2 + 2672dxy + 6460yd2x \u2212 146992xd3 = 0.\n11\nis a critical set. HowNow by applying the algorithm in [1] we get that\n25\n\u001a\n\u001b\n11 \u22129\never, Critical yields\n(which in this case coincides with Spec1 , see\n,\n25 17\nSubsection 3.4); so, the second element of this last set is clearly superfluous.\nIn fact, when plotting curves corresponding to d \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 11/25), d = 11/25\n\u001a\n\n22\n\n\u001b\n\n\fFig. 2. Offsets to the cardioid\n\nand d \u2208 (11/25, \u221e), one gets a parabola in all the cases; hence, the topology\ntype does not change for d \u2208 R, i.e. even the value 11/25 provided by the\nimplicit algorithm, is superfluous. The total amount of time required for the\nwhole computation is 0.094 seconds.\nComparison Table. The following table shows a comparison between the\nalgorithm derived from the results in [1], and our algorithm, both of them\nimplemented in Maple. For each family, in this table we include whether the\nparametrization is rational or polynomial (Type: R, rational, or P, polynomial), and we provide the following data: the degree of the implicit equation\nof the associated surface (deg(f )), the total degree of the parametrization\n(degt (\u03c6)) i.e. the greatest power of the parameter t arising in the numerators\n23\n\n\fFig. 3. Details of Some Offsets to the cardioid\n\nand denominators of the coordinates, the highest power (deg\u03bb (\u03c6)) of \u03bb arising\nin the numerators and denominators of the coordinates, the timing for the\nalgorithm in [1] (Imp., in seconds), the timing for our algorithm (Crit., in\nseconds), the size of the critical set determined by the parametric algorithm\n(Size), and the difference (Dif.) between the sizes of the critical sets provided\nby both algorithms (i.e. the size of the critical set provided by Critical minus the size of the critical set provided by the algorithm in [1]). The symbol\n* in the column of Imp. means that the algorithm has been unable to provide\nan answer, or that the computation time exceeded reasonable bounds. In Appendix I one may find the expressions of all the parametrizations used here. It\nis worth mentioning that except for the families numbers 3 and 7, the rest of\nthe examples have been randomly generated. Also, the timings given include\nthe cost of checking the hypotheses.\n24\n\n\fFamily Type\n\ndeg(f ) degt (\u03c6) deg\u03bb (\u03c6)\n\nImp.\n\nCrit.\n\nSize\n\nDif.\n\n1.045\n\n14\n\n1\n\n36\n\n1\n\n1\n\nP.\n\n8\n\n4\n\n1\n\n35.347\n\n2\n\nP.\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n\n160.664 110.076\n\n3\n\nR.\n\n22\n\n7\n\n4\n\n*\n\n252.390\n\n70\n\n*\n\n4\n\nR.\n\n9\n\n6\n\n1\n\n*\n\n35.990\n\n33\n\n*\n\n5\n\nP.\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n\n158.140 108.389\n\n36\n\n1\n\n6\n\nP.\n\n28\n\n5\n\n4\n\n39.983\n\n14.945\n\n21\n\n0\n\n7\n\nR.\n\n16\n\n5\n\n2\n\n*\n\n31.543\n\n33\n\n*\n\n8\n\nR.\n\n9\n\n3\n\n2\n\n9.157\n\n0.344\n\n12\n\n3\n\n9\n\nR.\n\n24\n\n6\n\n3\n\n*\n\n74.770\n\n78\n\n*\n\n10\n\nR.\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0.109\n\n0.093\n\n7\n\n2\n\n11\n\nR.\n\n12\n\n3\n\n3\n\n19.580\n\n0.389\n\n25\n\n0\n\n12\n\nR.\n\n18\n\n3\n\n3\n\n66.253\n\n1.325\n\n30\n\n9\n\n4.4 Improvements in the computation.\n\nThe (1)-values, (3)-values and (2)-values not corresponding to self-intersections\nof M can be more efficiently computed by taking advantage of certain geometric properties of C. In fact, one can determine these values by solving\npolynomial systems in two variables; so, we can avoid one resultant, and identify quite fast some values as potentially critical. This is based on two classical\nresults. The first one follows essentially from Proposition 3 of [7].\nProposition 15 Let Q = (xq , zq ) be a singularity of M, which is not a selfintersection of M, and such that zq is not a root of lcoeff y (F ). Then, one of\nthese two possibilities occur: (i) Q is the projection of a singularity of C; (ii)\nthere exists a point of C, projecting onto Q, so that the tangent to C at this\npoint is normal to the xz-plane.\nThe second result relates the non-singular points of M with tangent parallel to\nthe z-axis, to certain notable points of C. It can be easily proven by reasoning\nwith places.\nProposition 16 Let Q \u2208 M be a non-singular point of M with tangent\nparallel to the x-axis. Then, there exists some point Q\u2032 \u2208 C, projecting onto\nQ, so that the tangent to C at Q\u2032 is parallel to the xz-plane.\n25\n\n\fSo, let us consider first (1)-values and (2)-values. Those of these values not\ncorresponding to: (i) self-intersections of M, (ii) real roots of lcoeff y (F ),\n(iii) points of \u03c0crit (C), are real z0 -values fufilling that there exists (x0 , z0 ) \u2208\nM1 \u222a M2 . Now M1 can be seen as the union of the following two curves: (1)\nthe projection onto the xz-plane of the space curve C \u03031 defined by f (x, t, z) =\n0, h(t, z) = 0 in the Euclidean space with coordinates {x, t, z}, which we denote as \u03c0xz (C \u03031 ); (2) the curve defined in the xz-plane by gcd(lcoeff t (h), lcoeff t (f )).\nThe equation of \u03c0xz (C \u03031 ) is clearly h(t, z) = 0. Thus, by Proposition 15 and\nProposition 16, and using elementary properties of the resultant, one gets that\nthe considered values belonging to M1 also satisfy ht (t, z) = 0, and hence they\nare contained in the set of real roots of Rest (h, ht ); one may observe that this\nset contains also the real roots of gcd(lcoeff t (h), lcoeff t (f )). Arguing in a similar way for M2 we would reach the condition Rest (j, jt ) = 0. Moreover, the\n(3)-values can be related with the asymptotes of the curves (in the tz-plane)\nh(t, z) = 0 and j(t, z) = 0. So, the following theorem holds.\nTheorem 17 The (1)-values, (2)-values not corresponding to self-intersections\nof M, and (3)-values not corresponding to asymptotes of \u03c0xz (Ccrit ), are among\nthe finitely many real roots of Rest (h, ht ), Rest (j, jt ).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have presented an algorithm for computing a critical set\nof a family of rational curves depending on a parameter. From the critical\nset, the topology types in the family can be derived. The algorithm is based\non a geometric interpretation of known results for the implicit case, and on\nadvantages of parametric representation, and requires certain properties on\nthe family to be analyzed. These properties can be algorithmically checked.\nIn our experimentation, we have found that the timings of the parametric\nalgorithm are usually quite better than those of the implicit algorithm; in fact,\nthe parametric algorithm is able to manage inputs that the implicit algorithm\ncannot deal with. On the other hand, the drawback of the provided algorithm\nis that it may determine critical sets bigger than those determined by the\nimplicit algorithm, therefore containing superfluous values with respect to the\nimplicit critical set. So, as a potential future line of research, one could address\nthe problem of reducing the size of the output, trying to approach optimality.\nFurthermore, the method applies with exact coefficients. So, it would also\nbe nice to consider the (challenging) possibility of applying it in the case of\napproximate coefficients.\nAcknowledgements.
