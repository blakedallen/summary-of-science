The existence of unextendible product bases impels us to study the 'entanglement bases'\nproblems. In this paper, the concepts of entanglement bases and exact-entanglement bases are\ndefined, and a theorem about exact-entanglement bases is given. We discuss the general structures\nof the orthogonal complete bases. Two examples of applications are given. At last, we discuss the\nproblem of transformation of the general structure forms.\nPACC numbers: 03.67.Mn, 03.65.Ud, 03.67.Hk.\n\nIn quantum mechanics and quantum information, the concept of bases of a Hilbert space is of paramount importance.\nA product basis (PB) of a Hilbert space of multipartite quantum states is a set of orthogonal product pure-states.\nIn common cases, we always use the standard bases, which are the simplest PBs. However, especially in quantum\ninformation theory, one need to use the bases consisting of some entangled pure-states. For instance, in the study of\nteleportation the Bell's bases, which are maximally entangled states, are very important. Thus, it is necessary that\nin quantum information we consider various possible orthogonal bases. In principle, a general orthogonal complete\nbasis consists of some product pure-states and some entangled pure-states. Related this, recently a problem discussed\nin depth is the so-called 'unextendible product basis (UPB)'[1], which must relate to the bases consisting of some\nentangled pure-states. There are many works about UPB, mainly see Bennett, DiVincenzo, Terhal et al.[1-5], in\naddition, [6-12], these works show that the UPBs have many quite special properties.\nAn UPB of a Hilbert space H of multipartite quantum states is a PB S, S spans a subspace HS in H, and the\ncomplementary subspace H\u2212HS contains no product state. The existence of UPBs means that the structures of\ngeneral orthogonal complete bases are more complex. Since either a pure-state is a product state, or an entangled\nstate (it may be partial separable), to discuss the structures of general orthogonal complete bases of H is just to\ndiscuss how the product pure-states and entangled pure-states assort in the bases. In this paper, first we define the\nconcepts of entanglement basis and exact-entanglement basis, and give a theorem about the exact-entanglement bases.\nTwo examples of applications are given. We discuss the problem of the general structures of the orthogonal complete\nbases. At last, we consider the transformation problem.\nGenerally, for a given pure-state we can more easily decide whether it is separable (i.e. a product state), or is\nentangled. For instance, according to the entanglement of formation[13], only the rank of the coefficient matrix of a\nbipartite qubit pure-states can decide whether this state is separable, or not. As for a given multipartite qubit purestate, we can use other criteria, e.g. the criteria given by D\u00fcr[14] and Kauffman et al.[15], etc.. Since the purpose in\nthis paper is not to study the problem of criteria of separability, for the sake of simplicity, in the following we assume\nthat for any given multipartite pure-state we always can decide whether it is a product state, or is an entangled state.\nConsider a multipartite quantum system H= \u2297M\ni=1 Hi with M parties of respective dimension di , the total dimenM\nQ\ndi . If an orthogonal complete basis B ={| \u03c90 >, | \u03c91 >, * * * , | \u03c9N \u22121 >} of H is given, then\nsionality of H is N =\ni=1\n\nwe always have\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n| \u03c9s >< \u03c9s |= I\n\n(1)\n\ns=0\n\nwhere I is the N \u00d7 N unit matrix.\nB can be split into two parts as S= {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >} and\nT ={| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >}, i.e. | \u03c8i >=| \u03c9i >, | \u03c6j >=| \u03c9j+m\u22121 > (m + n = N ), then B = S \u222a T =\n{| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} . Let HS and HT , respectively, be the subspaces spanned\bby S and T. For\n\u2032\n,\nany orthogonal basis S \u2032 of HS , there must be a m \u00d7 m unitary matrix U (m) such that S \u2032 = SU(m) = \u03c80\u2032 , * * * , \u03c8m\u22121\nm\u22121\nP\nwhere | \u03c8i\u2032 >=\n[U (m)]is | \u03c8s > . Similarly, any orthogonal basis T \u2032 of HT can be written as T \u2032 = TU(n) =\ns=0\n\nn\u22121\n\b \u2032\nP\n\u03c60 , * * * , \u03c6\u2032n\u22121 , where | \u03c6\u2032j >=\n[U (n)]js | \u03c6s > .\ns=0\n\nDefinition. Consider a multipartite quantum system H= \u2297M\ni=1 Hi with M parties of respective dimension di , the\nM\nQ\ndi . An entanglement basis (EB) T ={| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} is a set of n entangled\ntotal dimensionality of H is N =\ni=1\n\npure-states, | \u03c6j > (j = 0, * * * , n \u2212 1) , such that an arbitrary linear combination of them steel is an entangled pure1\n\n\fstate. The subspace HT spanned by an EB T ( HT does not contain any disentangled pure-states) is called an entanglement space (ES). An EB T is called exact-entanglement basis (EEB) if there is a UPB S = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >}\ncontaining m = N \u2212 n product states such that B = S \u222a T = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} forms an\northogonal complete basis of H. In this case the subspace HT is called an exact-entanglement space (EES), in which\nall states and the UPB S are orthogonal each other. And we call B a complete basis with an unextendible product\nbasis (CBUPB).\n\u22a5\nFor an EES HES , the corresponding UPB S is in H \u22a5\nES , where HES is the orthogonal complementary subspace\nof HES . About this, recently Bravy[11] proves a result in the case of tripartite qubit states (the Lemma 3 in [11]).\nHowever, it is easily seen that the Lemma 3 and its proof in [11], in fact, can be directly generalized to higher\ndimensional cases, thus we have the following useful lemma\n\u22a5\nLemma 1. For an EES HES , the corresponding UPB in HES\nis unique.\nAs in the above mention, it is necessary that in quantum information we should consider the general orthogonal\ncomplete bases. In the first place, we consider the problem what are the conditions of an EB to be an EEB. Another\nproblem is how to describe the general form of orthogonal complete bases. The following theorem can answer the\nabove problems, it,in fact, is a criterion of the existence of EEBs, and it can be used to describe the general structures\nof orthogonal complete bases.\nTheorem 1. The sufficient and necessary conditions for an ES HES to be an EES are that\nM\nP\n(di \u2212 1) \u2212 1.\n(A) The dimensionality n of HES satisfies n \u2264 N \u2212\ni=1\n\n(B)( For any orthogonal\n) basis T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6N \u2212n\u22121 >} of HES\nn\u22121\nP\n1\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | is separable, where I is the N \u00d7 N unit matrix.\nI\u2212\nN \u2212n\n\n,\n\nthe uniform mixture \u03c1=\n\nj=0\n\nProof. Necessity. Suppose that HES is a n-dimensional EES and T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} is an arbitrary\northogonal basis in HES , then there is an UPB S={| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >} , every | \u03c8i > (i = 0, * * * , m \u2212 1, m + n = N )\nis a product pure-states, such that S \u222a T forms a CBUPB of H.\nM\nP\n(di \u2212 1) + 1, then n = N \u2212 m \u2264\n(A) According to [1], the number m of states in an UPB must satisfy m \u2265\ni=1\n\nN\u2212\n\nM\nP\n\n(di \u2212 1) \u2212 1.\n\ni=1\n\n(B) According to Eq.(1), we have\nm\u22121\nX\n\n| \u03c8i >< \u03c8i | +\n\ni=0\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j |= I\n\n(2)\n\nj=0\n\nHere | \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 > all are products of pure-states, according to the definition of separability of the multipartite\nsystems, the uniform mixture\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nn\u22121\n\uf8fd m\u22121\n\uf8f2\nX 1\nX\n1\n\u03c1=\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | =\n| \u03c8i >< \u03c8i |\n(3)\nI\u2212\n\uf8fe\nN \u2212n\uf8f3\nm\ni=0\nj=0\n\nis separable.\nSufficiency. Suppose that for a subspace HES the conditions (A) and (B) both hold. Now, in this HES we\nM\nP\n(di \u2212 1) \u2212 1), then according to (B),\ntake arbitrarily an orthogonal basis T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} (n \u2264 N \u2212\ni=1\n)\n(\nn\u22121\nP\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | is separable, i.e. there must be a decomposition of \u03c1 as\nthe density matrix \u03c1= N 1\u2212n I \u2212\nj=0\n)\n(\nn\u22121\nP\nP\nP\n1\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | =\u03c1=\nI\u2212\nps = 1, every \u03c1s =| \u03a8s >< \u03a8s | is a product\ns ps \u03c1s , where 0 < ps \u2264 1,\nN \u2212n\ns\n\nj=0\n\nstate. Then we have\n\nn\u22121\n1\n1X\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j |=\nn j=0\nn\n\n(\n\nI \u2212 (N \u2212 n)\n\nRight multiplied two sides of Eq.(4) by | \u03a8t >, we obtain\n2\n\nX\ns\n\np s \u03c1s\n\n)\n\n(4)\n\n\fn\u22121\nX\nj=0\n\n\u03bbj,t | \u03c6j >=\n\nX\n\n\u03bcs,t | \u03a8s >,\n\n(5)\n\ns\n\nwhere \u03bbj,t = n1 < \u03c6j | \u03a8t > and \u03bcs,t = n1 (\u03b4st \u2212 (N \u2212 n) ps ) < \u03a8s | \u03a8t > . But according to the definition of EB\nand the above supposition, generally Eq.(5) is impossible (the left side is entangled, but the right side is separable),\nonly possibility is that two sides of Eq.(5) both vanish.

Generally, in an\northogonal complete basis there may be some entangled pure-states, especially, these entangled pure-states can form\nan EB, even an EEB. All possible cases can be discussed as follows.\n(I) In B there is no EB. Now, a general orthogonal complete basis of H is in form as B = S \u222a R =\n{| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >, | \u03980 >, * * * , | \u0398N \u2212m\u22121 >} , where S = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8m\u22121 >} is an orthogonal product basis, and R = {| \u03980 >, * * * , | \u0398N \u2212m\u22121 >} is a set of orthogonal entangled pure-states, but R is not an EB, i.e. there\nN \u2212m\u22121\nP\nci | \u0398i > which is separable. This means that if m < N , S must be an extendible\nmay be a linear combination\ni=0\n\nproduct basis. Here there are two extreme cases: (i) n = N , then B is a complete orthogonal product basis, e.g. the\ncommon standard basis {| j\u03b11 > \u2297 * * * \u2297 | j\u03b1M >} (j\u03b1i = 0, 1, * * * , di \u2212 1 for i = 1, * * * , M ) is such a basis. (ii) n = 0,\nthen all pure-states in B are entangled, e.g. the known Bell's basis in the bipartite qubit systems is such a basis\n(notice that it is not an EB).\n(II) In B there is an EB T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} . Here, there are only two possibilities: (i) The mixed-state \u03c1=\n3\n\n\f1\nN \u2212n\n\n(\n\nI\u2212\n\nn\u22121\nP\n\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j |\n\nj=0\n\n)\n\nis separable, then according to the above theorem 1, T just is an EEB. This means that\n\nthere must be an UPB S = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8N \u2212n\u22121\n= {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8N \u2212n\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >}\n( >} , and B = S \u222aT)\nn\u22121\nP\nis an CBUPB. (ii) The mixed-state \u03c1= N 1\u2212n I \u2212\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | is entangled. In order to discuss this case, we\nj=0\n\nneed to use the following lemma:\n\nLemma 2. If T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} is an EB and the mixed-state \u03c1=\n\n1\nN \u2212n\n\n(\n\nI\u2212\n\nn\u22121\nP\n\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j |\n\nj=0\n\n)\n\nis entan-\n\ngled, then in the orthogonal complementary space HT\u22a5 there is no (N \u2212 n)-dimensional orthogonal product basis.\nProof. Conversely, suppose that in HT\u22a5 there is an orthogonal product basis S = {| (\n\u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8N \u2212n\u22121 >}\n), then\nn\u22121\nP\nS must be an UPB, since T is an EB. According to the Theorem 1, in this case \u03c1= N 1\u2212n I \u2212\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | must\nj=0\n\nbe separable, but this contradicts to the supposition. \u0003\nBy using of Lemma 2, we know that in the case (ii) the form of an orthogonal basis of HT\u22a5 must be as\n{| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8r\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6s\u22121 >} (1 \u2264 r \u2264 N \u2212 n \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 N \u2212 n \u2212 1, r + s = N \u2212 n \u2212 1) , where S =\n{| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8r\u22121 >} is a PB, and T \u2032 = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6s\u22121 >} is a set of orthogonal entangled pure-states, but it\nis not an EB (i.e. some linear combination of | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 > may be a separable state). Now the basis of H\nis in form as B = S \u222a T \u2032 \u222a T ={| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8r\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6s\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} .

A known UPB is the GenTiles given by DiVincenzo, Terhal et al.[2,3].\nBy using of the symbols as in [2,3], in H=Hn \u2297 Hn (n is even and n \u2265 4) the GenTiles1 {| Vmk >, | Hmk >, | F >}\nis defined by (here we have taken their normalization).\nn\n\n| Vmk\n\n\u22121\n\n2\nX\n2\n2\ni4\u03c0\n>= | k > \u2297 | \u03c9m,k+1 >= | k > \u2297\n\u03c9 jm | j + k + 1 mod n >, \u03c9 = e n\nn\nn\nj=0\n\n| Hmk >=\n\nn\u22121 n\u22121\n2\n1 XX\n|i>\u2297|j>\n| \u03c9m,k > \u2297 | k >, | F >= 2\nn\nn i=0 j=0\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m = 1, * * * , n2 \u2212 1, k = 0, * * * , n \u2212 1.If we take | Fr >=| r > \u2297 | r >, (r = 0, 1, * * * , 2 (n \u2212 1)), then\n{| Vmk >, | Hmk >, | F >, | Fr >} (the total of states is n2 ) is a linearly independent group of normalized states.\nNow, we define the normalized states | \u03c6r > (r = 0, * * * , 2 (n \u2212 1)) by induction as follows (i.e. the Schmidt's\northogonalization)\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nn\n2 \u22121 n\u22121\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX\nX\n(< Vmk | F0 >| Vmk > + < Hmk | F0 >| Hmk >) \u2212 < F | F0 >| F >\n| \u03c60 >= \u03b70 | F0 > \u2212\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nm=1 k=0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n4n8\n1\n= \u03b70 | 0 > \u2297 | 0 > \u2212 H00 \u2212 2 | F > , \u03b70 =\n2\n2\n2\n2\nn\nn\n4 (n4 \u2212 2n2 \u2212 1) + (n \u2212 2) (4n2 + 1) + 4n2 (n \u2212 1) + n2\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\f\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nn\nr\u22121\n2 \u22121 n\u22121\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX\nX\nX\n(< Vmk | Fr >| Vmk > + < Hmk | Fr >| Hmk >) \u2212 < F | Fr >| F > \u2212\n< \u03c6s | Fr >| \u03c6s >\n\u03c6r = \u03b7r | Fr > \u2212\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\nm=1 k=0\ns=0\n!\n)\n(\nr\u22121\nX\n1\n2\n| F > , r = 1, * * * , 2 (n \u2212 1)\n\u03b7s\n= \u03b7r | Fr > \u2212 Hrr \u2212 1 +\nn\nn2\ns=0\nwhere \u03b7r (r = 0, * * * , 2 (n \u2212 1)) are normalization factors, which are also determined by induction.\nTherefore the set\n\u0001\n{| Vmk >, | Hmk >, | F >, | \u03c6r >} m = 1, * * * , n2 \u2212 1, k = 0, * * * , n \u2212 1, r = 0, * * * , 2n \u2212 1 forms an orthogonal complete basis of H = Hn \u2297 Hn .

A similar result can be obtained from\nthe GenTiles2[2,3].\n2. Some bound entangled states. In the quantum information, one need to study the problem what the entanglement can be distilled, because this relates the quantum communication problems. A bound entangled state is such a\nentangled state that no entanglement can be distilled[18]. If in the system there is an EEB T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} ,\nn\u22121\n\u223d\nP\nthen according to the above Corollary 2, the uniform mixture \u03c1 = n1\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | is entangled and is a bound enj=0\n\ntangled state, this is a standard case as in [1,3]. However, we find that there may be yet other bound entangled states\nwith similar forms as follows.\n) that in the system there is a EB T = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6n\u22121 >} , but\n( For instance, suppose\nn\u22121\nP\n1\nthe mixed-state \u03c1= N \u2212n\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | is entangled, then according to the above classification tab, there\nI\u2212\nj=0\n\nare a PB S = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8r\u22121 >} and a T \u2032 = {| \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6s\u22121 >} (r + s + n = N ) , which is a set of orthogonal\nentangled pure-states but not an EB, they form together an orthogonal complete basis B = S \u222a T \u2032 \u222a T . Let\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n)\n(\nn\u22121\nr\u22121\ns\u22121\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX\nX\nX\n1\n1\n| \u03c6j >< \u03c6j | =\n| \u03c6k >< \u03c6k | +\nI\u2212\n| \u03c8k >< \u03c8k |\n(8)\n\u03c1e\u2032 =\n\uf8fe N \u2212r\ns+n\uf8f3\ni=0\n\nj=0\n\nk=0\n\nSince \u03c1e\u2032 contains the component part constructed by the states in T \u2032 , we cannot affirm that \u03c1e\u2032 must be a entangle\nstate for any T \u2032 . However in many cases, by a proper choice of T \u2032 , \u03c1e\u2032 always can become entangled. Notice that the\n\u223d\nrelated argument in the proof about \u03c1 to be a bound entangled state (see the proof of Theorem 1 in [1,3]), obviously,\nis still completely effective for \u03c1e\u2032 , i.e. in present case also no entanglement can be distilled. Therefore \u03c1e\u2032 is a bound\nentangled state. This example shows the multiformity of bound entangled states with the uniform mixture forms.\nAt last, we consider the problem of transformations. Since at present we only discuss the orthogonal bases, we\ncannot use the general local operations and classical communication[13]. However, we can use the local unitary\ntransformations.\nTheorem\n2.\nThe\nstructure\nform\nof\na\ngeneral\northogonal complete basis B = S \u222a T = {| \u03c80 >, * * * , | \u03c8n\u22121 >, | \u03c60 >, * * * , | \u03c6k\u22121 >} (n + k = N ) is invariant under\na local operation as\n\b\n\u2032\n>, | \u03c6\u20320 >, * * * , | \u03c6\u2032k\u22121 >\nG : B \u2212\u2192 B \u2032 = S \u2032 \u222a T \u2032 = | \u03c80\u2032 >, * * * , | \u03c8n\u22121\n| \u03c8i\u2032 >= u (d1 ) \u2297 u (d2 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 u (dM ) (| \u03c8i >) , | \u03c6\u2032j >= u (d1 ) \u2297 u (d2 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 u (dM ) (| \u03c6j >)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere u (di ) ((i = 1, * * * , M ) are arbitrary di \u00d7 di unitary matrixes.\nProof. Obviously, an interior product of any two states is invariant under this G, then an orthogonal complete\nbasis will be changed into another orthogonal complete basis under G, i.e. G indeed is a transformation of general\northogonal complete bases. Next, for a pure-state | \u03c8 >, the pure-state | \u03c8 \u2032 >= u (d1 ) \u2297 u (d2 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 u (dM ) (| \u03c8 >)\nis a product state, if and only if | \u03c8 > is a product state itself. This means that if in B there is no EB, then in\nB \u2032 = G (B) there is yet no EB. In addition, when in B there is an EB T, the corresponds uniform mixture is \u03c1, then\n\u2032\nthe uniform mixture \u03c1 = u (d1 ) \u2297 u (d2 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 u (dM ) \u03c1 u\u22121 (dM ) \u2297 u\u22121 (dM\u22121 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 u\u22121 (d1 ) is separable, if and\nonly if \u03c1 is separable itself. According to the above classification tab and these discussions, it has been proved that\nthe structure form of a general orthogonal complete basis B is invariant under G. \u2737\n5\n\n\fThis theorem can be used to create various orthogonal complete bases (in the same type) from given one.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\nC.
