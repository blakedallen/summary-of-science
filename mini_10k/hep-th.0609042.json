Introduction and Summary\nThe theory of D-branes has proven to be of great importance in the development of\nstring theory. In this paper we will focus on certain mathematical structures central to the\nidea of D-branes. One of the questions which motivated our work was: \"Given a closed\nstring background, what is the set of possible D-branes?\" This is a rather complicated\nquestion. One might at first be tempted to declare that D-branes simply correspond to\nconformally invariant boundary conditions for the open string. This viewpoint is not\nvery useful because there are too many such boundary conditions, and in general they\nhave no geometrical description. It also neglects important restrictions imposed by sewing\nconsistency conditions.\nIn this paper we address the above problem in the drastically simpler case of twodimensional topological field theory (TFT), where the whole content of the theory is encoded in a finite-dimensional commutative Frobenius algebra. We shall find that describing\nthe sewing conditions, and their solutions for 2d topological open and closed TFT, is a\ntractable but not entirely trivial problem. We also extend our results to the equivariant\ncase, where we are given a finite group G, and the worldsheets are surfaces equipped with\nG-bundles. This is relevant to the classification of D-branes in orbifolds.\nAnother one of our primary motivations has been the desire to understand the relation\nbetween D-branes and K-theory in the simplest possible terms. This relation is often\njustified by considerations of anomaly cancellation or of brane-antibrane annihilation. Our\nanalysis shows that the relation is, in some sense, more primitive, and follows simply from\nsewing constraints.\nWe hope the present work will be of some pedagogical interest in explaining the\nstructure of boundary conformal field theory and its connections to K-theory in the simplest\ncontext. There are also, however, some potential applications of our results. One ambitious\ngoal is to classify the boundary conditions in topologically twisted nonlinear sigma models\nand their allied topological string theories. Here we have some suggestive results, but they\nare far from a complete theory.\nOur main concrete results are the following two theorems. To state the first we must\npoint out that a semisimple Frobenius algebra1 C is automatically the algebra of complexvalued functions on a finite set X = Spec(C) - the \"space-time\" - which is equipped\n\nwith a \"volume-form\" or \"dilaton field\" \u03b8 which assigns a measure \u03b8x to each point x \u2208 X.\n1\n\nFor basic material on Frobenius algebras see, for example, [1], ch. 9 or [2].\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem A For a semisimple 2-dimensional TFT corresponding to a finite space-time\n(X, \u03b8) the choice of a maximal category of D-branes fixes a choice of a square-root of\n\u03b8x for each point x of X. The category of boundary conditions is equivalent to the\ncategory Vect(X) of finite-dimensional complex vector bundles on X. The correspondence is, however, not canonical, but is arbitrary up to composition with an equivalence\nVect(X) \u2192 Vect(X) given by tensoring each vector bundle with a fixed line bundle (i.e.\none which does not depend on the particular D-brane).\n\nConversely, if we are given a semisimple Frobenius category B, then it is the category of\n\nboundary conditions for a canonical 2-dimensional TFT corresponding to the commutative\nFrobenius algebra which is the ring of endomorphisms of the identity functor of B.\nWe shall explain in the next section the sense in which the boundary conditions form\na category. The theorem will be proved in section 3. In \u00a73.4 we shall describe an analogue\nof the theorem for spin theories.\n\nThe second theorem relates to \"G-equivariant\" or \"G-gauged\" TFTs, where G is a\nfinite group. Turaev has shown that in dimension 2 a semisimple G-equivariant TFT\ncorresponds to a finite space-time X on which the group G acts in a given way, and which\nis equipped with a G-invariant dilaton field \u03b8 and as well as a \"B-field\" B representing an\n3\n(X; ZZ).\nelement of the equivariant cohomology group HG\n\nTheorem B For a semisimple G-equivariant TFT corresponding to a finite space time\n(X, \u03b8, B) the choice of a maximal category of D-branes fixes a G-invariant choice of\n\u221a\nsquare roots \u03b8 x as before, and then the category is equivalent to the category of finitedimensional B-twisted G-vector-bundles on X, up to an overall tensoring with a G-linebundle.\nIn this case the category of D-branes is equivalent to that of the \"orbifold\" theory\nobtained from the gauged theory by integrating over the gauge fields, and it does not\nremember the equivariant theory from which the orbifold theory arose. There is, however,\na natural enrichment which does remember the equivariant theory.\nThis will be explained and proved in section 7.\nThe restriction to the semisimple case in our results seems at first a damaging weakness. We believe, however, that it is this case that reveals the essential structure of the\n2\n\n\ftheory. To go beyond it, the appropriate objects of study, in our view, are cochain-complexvalued TFTs rather than non-semisimple TFTs in the usual sense. (This is analogous to\nthe fact that in ordinary algebra the duality theory of non-projective modules is best studied in the derived category.) We have said something about this line of development in\nsections 2 and 6, explaining how the category of boundary conditions is naturally an A\u221e\ncategory in the sense of Fukaya, Kontsevich, and others.\nLet us comment on one important conceptual aspect of the results of this paper.\nIn the Matrix theory approach to nonperturbative string theory [3][4] open string field\ntheory, or rather its low-energy Yang-Mills theory, is taken to be the fundamental starting\npoint for the formulation of the entire string theory. In particular, spacetime, and the\nclosed strings, are regarded as derived concepts. A similar philosophy lies at the root of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper we begin our discussion with the viewpoint\nthat the spacetime and closed strings are fundamental and then ask what category of\nboundary conditions is compatible with that background. However, in the semisimple\ncase, we find that one could equally well start with the Frobenius category of boundary\nconditions and derive the closed strings and the spacetime. Thus, our treatment is in\nharmony with the philosophy of Matrix theory. Indeed, it is possible to obtain the closed\nstring algebra from the open string algebra by taking the center of the open string algebra\nZ(O) \u223c\n= C. (In general the Cardy condition only shows that \u03b9\u2217 (C) maps into the center.)\n\nA more sophisticated version of this idea is that the closed string algebra is obtained from\nthe category of boundary conditions by considering the endomorphisms of the identity\nfunctor. All this is discussed in \u00a73.3, and justifies the important point that there is a\nconverse statement to Theorem A.\n\nA closely related point is that in open string field theory there are different open\nstring algebras Oaa for the different boundary conditions a. For boundary conditions with\n\nmaximal support, however, they are Morita equivalent via the bimodules Oab . For some\n\npurposes it might seem more elegant to start with a single algebra. (Indeed, Witten has\nsuggested in [5] that one should use something analogous to stabilization of C \u2217 algebras,\nnamely one should replace the string field algebra by Oaa \u2297 K where K is the algebra\n\nof compact operators.) In our framework, the single algebra is replaced by the category\nof boundary conditions. If one believes that a stringy spacetime is a non-commutative\nspace, our framework is in good agreement with Kontsevich's approach to non-commutative\ngeometry, according to which a non-commutative space is a linear category - essentially\nthe category of modules for the ring, if the space is defined by a ring. For commutative\n3\n\n\frings the category of modules determines the ring, but in the non-commutative case the\nring is determined only up to Morita equivalence. We discuss this further in section \u00a73.\n\nFinally, we comment briefly on some related literature. There is a rather large litera-\n\nture on 2d TFT and it is impossible to give comprehensive references. Here we just indicate\nsome closely related works. The 2d closed sewing theorem is a very old result implicit in\nthe earliest papers in string theory. The algebraic formulation was perhaps first formulated by Friedan. Accounts have been given in [6][7][8] and in the Stanford lectures by\nSegal [9]. Sewing constraints in 2D open and closed string theory were first investigated in\n[10]. Extensions to unorientable worldsheets were described in [11][12][13][14]. Our work\u2013\nwhich is primarily intended as a pedagogical exposition \u2013 was first described at Strings\n2000 [15] and summarized briefly in [16]. It was described more completely in lectures at\nthe KITP in 2001 and at the 2002 Clay School [17]. In [18] one can find alternative (more\ncomputational) proofs and examples to those we give below, together with better quality\npictures.\n\n2\n\nSome of our work was independently obtained in the papers of C. Lazaroiu [19]\n\nalthough the emphasis in these papers is on applications to disk instanton corrections in\nlow energy supergravity. Regarding G-equivariant theories, there is a very large literature\non D-branes and orbifolds not reflected in the above references. In the context of 2D TFT\ntwo relevant references are [20][21]. Alternative discussions on the meaning of B-fields in\norbifolds (in TFT) can be found in [22][23][24]. Our treatment of cochain-level theories\nand A\u221e algebras has been developed considerably further by Costello [25].\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Ilka Brunner, Robbert Dijkgraaf, Dan Freed, Kentaro Hori\nand Anton Kapustin for some useful and clarifying discussions.

The sewing theorem\n2.1. Definition of open and closed 2D TFT\nRoughly speaking, a quantum field theory is a functor from a geometric category to\na linear category. The simplest example is a topological field theory, where we choose the\ngeometric category to be the category whose objects are closed, oriented (d \u2212 1)-manifolds,\nand whose morphisms are oriented cobordisms (two such cobordisms being identified if\nthey are diffeomorphic by a diffeomorphism which is the identity on the incoming and\noutgoing boundaries). The linear category in this case is simply the category of complex\nvector spaces and linear maps, and the only property we require of the functor is that (on\nobjects and morphisms) it takes disjoint unions to tensor products. The case d = 2 is of\ncourse especially well known and understood.\nThere are several natural ways to generalize the geometric category. One may, for\nexample, consider manifolds equipped with some structure such as a Riemannian metric.\n(We shall discuss some examples in the following.) The focus of this paper is on a different\nkind of generalization where the objects of the geometric category are oriented (d \u2212 1)manifolds with boundary, and each boundary component is labelled with an element of\na fixed set B0 called the set of boundary conditions. In this case a cobordism from Y0 to\nY1 means a d-manifold X whose boundary consists of three parts \u2202X = Y0 \u222a Y1 \u222a \u2202cstr X,\nwhere the \"constrained boundary\" \u2202cstr X is a cobordism from \u2202Y0 to \u2202Y1 . Furthermore,\nwe require the connected components of \u2202cstr X to be labelled with elements of B0 in\nagreement with the labelling of \u2202Y0 and \u2202Y1 .\nThus when d = 2 the objects of the geometric category are disjoint unions of circles\nand oriented intervals with labelled ends. A functor from this category to complex vector\nspaces which takes disjoint unions to tensor products will be called an open and closed\ntopological field theory: such theories will give us a \"baby\" model of the theory of Dbranes. We shall always write C for the vector space associated to the standard circle S 1 ,\nand Oab for the vector space associated to the interval [0, 1] with ends labelled by a, b \u2208 B0 .\n5\n\n\fFig. 1: Basic cobordism on open strings.\n\nmap\n\nThe cobordism fig. 1 gives us a linear map Oab \u2297 Obc \u2192 Oac , or equivalently a bilinear\nOab \u00d7 Obc \u2192 Oac ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhich we think of as a composition law. In fact we have a C-linear category B whose\n\nobjects are the elements of B0 , and whose set of morphisms from b to a is the vector space\n\nOab , with composition of morphisms given by (2.1) . (To say that B is a category means\n\nno more than that the composition (2.1) is associative in the obvious sense, and that there\nis an identity element 1a \u2208 Oaa for each a \u2208 B0 ; we shall explain presently why these\n\nproperties hold.)\n\nFor any open and closed TFT we have a map e : C \u2192 C defined by the cylindrical\n\ncobordism S 1 \u00d7 [0, 1], and a map eab : Oab \u2192 Oab defined by the square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1].\nClearly e2 = e and e2ab = eab . If all these maps are identity maps we say the theory is\nreduced. There is no loss in restricting ourselves to reduced theories, and we shall do so\nfrom now on.\n2.2. Algebraic characterization\nThe most general 2D open and closed TFT, formulated as in the previous section, is\ngiven by the following algebraic data:\n1. (C, \u03b8C , 1C ) is a commutative Frobenius algebra.\n2a.

There are linear maps:\n\u03b9a : C \u2192 Oaa\n\u03b9a : Oaa \u2192 C\n\n(2.6)\n\nsuch that\n3a. \u03b9a is an algebra homomorphism\n\u03b9a (\u03c61 \u03c62 ) = \u03b9a (\u03c61 )\u03b9a (\u03c62 )\n\n(2.7)\n\n3b. The identity is preserved\n\n\u03b9a (1C ) = 1a\n\n(2.8)\n\n3c. Moreover, \u03b9a is central in the sense that\n\u03b9a (\u03c6)\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03b9b (\u03c6)\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03b8C (\u03b9a (\u03c8)\u03c6) = \u03b8a (\u03c8\u03b9a (\u03c6))\n\n(2.10)\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 C and \u03c8 \u2208 Oab\n\n3d. \u03b9a and \u03b9a are adjoints:\n\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 Oaa .\n7\n\n\f3e. The \"Cardy conditions.\"3 Define \u03c0b\n\na\n\n: Oaa \u2192 Obb as follows. Since Oab and Oba\n\nare in duality (using \u03b8a or \u03b8b ), if we let \u03c8\u03bc be a basis for Oba then there is a dual basis \u03c8 \u03bc\n\nfor Oab . Then we define\n\n\u03c0b a (\u03c8) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03bc \u03c8\u03c8 \u03bc ,\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u03bc\n\nand we have the \"Cardy condition\":\n\u03c0b\n\na\n\n= \u03b9b \u25e6 \u03b9a .\n\n(2.12)\n\nFig. 2: Four diagrams defining the Frobenius structure in a closed 2d TFT. It is\noften more convenient to represent the morphisms by the planar diagrams. In this\ncase our convention is that a circle oriented so that the right hand points into the\nsurface is an ingoing circle.\n\nFig. 3: Associativity, commutativity, and unit constraints in the closed case. The\nunit constraint requires the natural assumption that the cylinder correspond to the\nidentity map C \u2192 C.\n3\n\nThese are actually generalization of the conditions stated by Cardy. One recovers his condi-\n\ntions by taking the trace. Of course, the factorization of the double twist diagram in the closed\nstring channel is an observation going back to the earliest days of string theory.\n\n8\n\n\f2.3. Pictorial representation\nLet us explain the pictorial basis for these algebraic conditions. The case of a closed 2d\nTFT is very well-known. The data of the Frobenius structure is provided by the diagrams\nin fig. 2. The consistency conditions follow from fig. 3.\n\nFig. 4: Basic data for the open theory. Constrained boundaries are denoted with\nwiggly lines, and carry a boundary condition a, b, c, . . . \u2208 B0 ..\n\nFig. 5: Assuming that the strip corresponds to the identity morphism we must\nhave perfect pairings in (2.4).\n\nFig. 6: Two ways of representing open to closed and closed to open transitions.\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 7: \u03b9a is a homomorphism.\n\nFig. 8: \u03b9a preserves the identity.\n\nFig. 9: \u03b9a maps into the center of Oaa .\n\nFig. 10: \u03b9a is the adjoint of \u03b9a .\n\nIn the open case, entirely analogous considerations lead to the construction of a nonnecessarily commutative Frobenius algebra in the open sector. The basic data are summa10\n\n\fFig. 11: The double-twist diagram defines the map \u03c0ba : Oaa \u2192 Obb .\n\nFig. 12: The (generalized) Cardy-condition expressing factorization of the doubletwist diagram in the closed string channel.\n\nrized in fig. 4. The fact that (2.4) are dual pairings follows from fig. 5. The essential new\ningredient in the open/closed theory are the open to closed and closed to open transitions.\nIn 2d TFT these are the maps \u03b9a , \u03b9a . They are represented by fig. 6. There are five new\nconsistency conditions associated with the open/closed transitions. These are illustrated\nin fig. 7 to fig. 12.\n2.4. Sewing theorem\nGeometrically, any oriented surface can be decomposed into a composition of morphisms corresponding to the basic data defining the Frobenius structure. However, a given\nsurface can be decomposed in many different ways. The above sewing axioms follow from\nconsistency of these decompositions. The sewing theorem guarantees that there are no\nfurther relations on the algebraic data imposed by consistency of sewing.\nTheorem 1 Conditions 1,2,3 above are the only conditions on the algebraic data coming\nfrom cutting the morphisms in all possible ways.\nThe proof is in appendix A.\n11\n\n\f2.5. The category of boundary conditions\nThe category B of boundary conditions of an open and closed TFT is an additive\n\ncategory. We can always adjoin new objects to it in various ways. For example, we may\n\nas well assume that it possesses direct sums, as we can define for any two objects a and b\na new object a \u2295 b by\n\nOa\u2295b,c := Oac \u2295 Obc\n\n(2.13)\n\nOc,a\u2295b := Oca \u2295 Ocb ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nand hence\nOa\u2295b,a\u2295b :=\nwith the obvious composition laws, and\n\n\u0012\n\nOaa\nOba\n\nOab\nObb\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u03b8a\u2295b : Oa\u2295b,a\u2295b \u2192 C\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\ngiven by\n\u03b8a\u2295b\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c8aa\n\u03c8ba\n\n\u03c8ab\n\u03c8bb\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u03b8a (\u03c8aa ) + \u03b8b (\u03c8bb ).\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe new object is the direct sum of a and b in the enlarged category of boundary conditions.\nIf there was already a direct sum of a and b in the category B then the new object\n\nwill be canonically isomorphic to it. In the opposite direction, if we have a boundary\ncondition a and a projection p \u2208 Oaa (i.e. an element such that p2 = p) then we may\n\nas well assume there is a boundary condition b = image(p) such that for any c we have\n\nOcb = {f \u2208 Oab : pf = f } and Obc = {f \u2208 Oba : f p = f }. Then we shall have\na\u223c\n= image(p) \u2295 image(1 \u2212 p).4\nOne very special property that the category B possesses is that for any two objects a\n\nand b the space Oab of morphisms is canonically dual to Oba , by a pairing which factorizes\n\nthrough the composition in either order. It is natural to call a category with this property\na Frobenius category, or perhaps a Calabi-Yau category.5 It is a strong restriction on the\n4\n\nA linear category in which idempotents split in this way is often called Karoubian.\n\n5\n\nThe latter terminology comes from the case of coherent sheaves on a compact K\u00e4hler man-\n\nifold, where for two sheaves E and F the dual of the morphism space Ext(E; F ) is in general\nExt(F ; E \u2297 \u03c9), where \u03c9 is the canonical bundle. This coincides with Ext(F ; E) only when \u03c9 is\ntrivial, i.e. in the Calabi-Yau case. We shall discuss this example further in \u00a76.\n\n12\n\n\fcategory: for example the category of finitely generated modules over a finite dimensional\nalgebra does not have the property unless the algebra is semisimple.\nExample Probably the simplest example of an open and closed theory of the type we are\nstudying is one associated to a finite group G. The category B is the category of finite\ndimensional complex representations M of G, and the trace \u03b8M : OM M = End(M ) \u2192 C\ntakes \u03c8 : M \u2192 M to 1/|G| trace(\u03c8). The closed algebra C is the center of the group-\n\nalgebra C[G], which maps to each End(M ) in the obvious way. The trace \u03b8C : C \u2192 C takes\nP\na central element\n\u03bbg g of the group-algebra to \u03bb1 /|G|.\nIn this example the partition function of the theory on a surface \u03a3 with constrained\n\nboundary circles C1 , . . . , Ck labelled M1 , . . . , Mk is the weighted sum over the isomorphism\nclasses of principal G-bundles P on \u03a3 of\n\u03c7M1 (hP (C1 )) . . . \u03c7Mk (hP (Ck )),\nwhere \u03c7M : G \u2192 C is the character of a representation M , and hP (C) denotes the holonomy\nof P around a boundary circle C. Each bundle P is weighted by the reciprocal of the order\nof its group of automorphisms.\nReturning to the general theory, we can now ask three basic questions.\n(i) If we are given a \"closed\" TFT, can we enlarge it to an open and closed theory,\nand, if so, is the enlargement unique?\n(ii) If we are given the category B of boundary conditions of an open and closed theory,\n\ntogether with the linear maps \u03b8a : Oaa \u2192 C which define the Frobenius structure, can we\nreconstruct the whole theory, i.e. can we find the closed Frobenius algebra C?\n(iii) Is an arbitrary Frobenius category the category of boundary conditions for some\nclosed theory?\nFor the first question to be well-posed, we should assume that the category of boundary\n\nconditions is maximal, in the sense that if B\u2032 is an enlargement of it then any object of\nB\u2032 is isomorphic to an object of B. Even so, we shall see that there are subtleties which\nprevent any of these question from having a simple affirmative answer.\n13\n\n\f2.6. Generalizations\nWe can obtain many interesting generalizations of the above structure by modifying\neither the geometrical or the linear category.\nThe most general target category we can consider is a symmetric tensor category:\nclearly we need a tensor product, and the axiom HY \u2294Y \u223c\n= HY \u2297 HY only makes sense if\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nthere is an involutory canonical isomorphism HY1 \u2297 HY2 \u223c\n= HY2 \u2297 HY1\n\nA very common choice in physics is the category of super vector spaces, i.e. vector\nspaces V with a mod 2 grading V = V 0 \u2295 V 1 , where the canonical isomorphism V \u2297 W \u223c\n=\nW \u2297 V is v \u2297 w 7\u2192 (\u22121)deg v deg w w \u2297 v. One can also consider the category of ZZ-graded\nvector spaces, with the same sign convention for the tensor product.\n\nIn either case the closed string algebra is a graded-commutative algebra C with a\n\ntrace \u03b8 : C \u2192 C. In principle the trace should have degree zero, but in fact the commonly\n\nencountered theories have a grading anomaly which makes the trace have degree \u2212n for\nsome integer n.6 The formulae (2.5), (2.9), and (2.11) must be replaced by their gradedcommutative analogues. In particular if we choose a basis \u03c8\u03bc and its dual \u03c8 \u03bc so that\n\u03b8C (\u03c8 \u03bc \u03c8 \u03bd ) = \u03b4 \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.18)\n\nthen\n\u03c0b a (\u03c8) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)deg \u03c8\u03bc deg \u03c8 \u03c8\u03bc \u03c8\u03c8 \u03bc\n\n(2.19)\n\n\u03bc\n\nWe can also obtain interesting structures by changing the geometrical category of\nmanifolds and cobordisms by equipping them with extra stucture.\nExample 1\n\nWe define topological-spin theories by replacing \"manifolds\" with \"manifolds\n\nwith spin-structure.\"\nA spin structure on a surface means a double covering of its space of non-zero tangent\nvectors which is non-trivial on each individual tangent space. On an oriented 1-dimensional\nmanifold S it means a double covering of the space of positively-oriented tangent vectors.\nFor purposes of gluing it is useful to note that this is the same thing as a spin structure\non a ribbon neighbourhood of S in an orientable surface. Each spin structure has an\n6\n\nIt is easy to see that, up to an overall translation of the grading, the most general anomaly\n\nassigns an operator of degree\n\n1\nn(i\n2\n\n\u2212 o \u2212 \u03c7) to a cobordism with Euler number \u03c7 and i incoming\n\nand o outgoing boundary circles.\n\n14\n\n\fautomorphism which interchanges its sheets, and this will induce an involution T on any\nvector space which is naturally associated to a 1-manifold with spin structure, giving the\nvector space a mod 2 grading by its \u00b11-eigenspaces. We define a topological-spin theory\n\nas a functor from the cobordism category of manifolds with spin structures to the category\nof super vector spaces with its graded tensor structure. The functor is required to take\ndisjoint unions to super tensor products, and we also require the automorphism of the spin\nstructure of a 1-manifold to induce the grading automorphism T = (\u22121)degree of the super\nvector space. We shall see presently that this choice of the supersymmetry of the tensor\nproduct rather than the naive symmetry which ignores the grading is forced on us by the\ngeometry of spin structures if we want to allow the possibility of a semisimple category of\n1\nboundary conditions. There are two non-isomorphic circles with spin structure: Sns\n, with\n\nthe M\u00f6bius or \"Neveu-Schwarz\" structure, and Sr1 , with the trivial or \"Ramond\" structure. A topological-spin theory gives us state-spaces Cns , respectively Cr corresponding to\n1\nSns\n, Sr1 .\n\n1\nThere are four annuli with spin structures, for, alongside the cylinders A+\nns,r = Sns,r \u00d7\n\n[0, 1] which induce the identity maps of Cns,r there are also cylinders A\u2212\nns,r which connect\n\n1\nSns,r\nto itself while interchanging the sheets. These cylinders A\u2212\nns,r induce the grading\n\u2212 \u223c\n+\nautomorphism on the state spaces. But because Ans = Ans by an isomorphism which\n\nis the identity on the boundary circles - the Dehn twist which \"rotates one end of the\ncylinder by 2\u03c0\" - the grading on Cns must be purely even. The space Cr can have both\neven and odd components. The situation is a little more complicated for \"U-shaped\"\n\ncobordisms, i.e. cylinders with two incoming or two outgoing boundary circles. If the\n1\nboundaries are Sns\nthere is only one possibility, but if the boundaries are Sr1 there are\n\ntwo, corresponding to Ans,r\n\u2212 . The complication is that there seems no special reason to\nprefer either of the spin structures as \"positive\". We shall simply choose one - let us\n\ncall it P - with incoming boundary Sr1 \u2294 Sr1 , and use P to define a pairing Cr \u2297 Cr \u2192 C.\n\nWe then choose a preferred cobordism Q in the other direction so that when we sew its\nright-hand outgoing Sr1 to the left-hand incoming one of P the resulting S-bend is the\n\"trivial\" cylinder A+\nr . We shall need to know, however, that the closed torus formed by\nthe composition P \u25e6 Q has an even spin structure. Note that Frobenius structure \u03b8 on C\n\nrestricts to 0 on Cr .\n\nThere is a unique spin structure on the pair-of-pants cobordism of fig.2 which restricts\n\n1\nto Sns\non each boundary circle, and it makes Cns into a commutative Frobenius algebra\n\n1\nin the usual way. If one incoming circle is Sns\nand the other is Sr1 then the outgoing\n\n15\n\n\fcircle is Sr1 , and there are two possible spin structures, but the one obtained by removing\na disc from the cylinder A+\nr is preferred: it makes Cr into a graded module over Cns . The\n\nchosen U-shaped cobordism P , with two incoming circles Sr1 , can be punctured to give us\n1\na pair of pants with an outgoing Sns\n, and it induces a graded bilinear map Cr \u00d7 Cr \u2192 Cns\n\nwhich, composing with the trace on Cns , gives a non-degenerate inner product on Cr . At\n\nthis point the choice of symmetry of the tensor product becomes important. For the\ndiffeomorphism of the pair of pants which shows us in the usual case that the Frobenius\nalgebra is commutative, when we lift it to the spin structure, induces the identity on one\nincoming circle but reverses the sheets over the other incoming circle, and this proves that\nthe cobordsism must have the same output when we change the input from S(\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62 ) to\n\nT (\u03c61 ) \u2297 \u03c62 , where T is the grading involution and S : Cr \u2297 Cr \u2192 Cr \u2297 Cr is the symmetry\n\nof the tensor category. If we take S to be the identity, this shows that the product on\nthe graded vector space Cr is graded-symmetric with the usual sign; but if S is the graded\n\nsymmetry then we see that the product on Cr is symmetric in the naive sense. (We must\n\nbear in mind here that if \u03c81 and \u03c82 do not have the same parity then their product is in\n\nany case zero, as we have seen that C+ is purely even.)\nThere is an analogue for spin theories of the theorem which tells us that a twodimensional topological field theory \"is\" a commutative Frobenius algebra. It asserts that\na spin-topological theory \"is\" a Frobenius algebra C = (Cns \u2295 Cr , \u03b8C ) with the properties\n\njust mentioned, and with the following additional property. Let {\u03c6k } be a basis for Cns ,\n\nwith dual basis {\u03c6k } such that \u03b8C (\u03c6k \u03c6m ) = \u03b4km , and let \u03b2k and \u03b2 k be similar dual bases\nP\nP\nfor Cr . Then the Euler elements \u03c7ns :=\n\u03c6k \u03c6k and \u03c7r =\n\u03b2k \u03b2 k are independent of the\n\nchoices of bases, and the condition we need on the algebra C is that \u03c7ns = \u03c7r . In particular,\n\nthis condition implies that the vector spaces Cns and Cr have the same dimension.\n\n7\n\nIn\n\nfact, the Euler elements can be obtained from cutting a hole out of the torus. There are\nactually four spin structures on the torus. The output state is necessarily in Cns . The\n\nEuler elements for the three even spin structures are equal to \u03c7e = \u03c7ns = \u03c7r . There is\n\nin addition an Euler element \u03c7o corresponding to the odd spin structure, it is given by\nP\n\u03c7o = (\u22121)deg \u03b2k \u03b2k \u03b2 k .\nWe shall omit the proof that the general spin theory is what we have just described,\n\nbut it is almost identical with the proof we shall give in the appendix of the theorem of\n7\n\nThus, in a sense, the theory has \"spacetime supersymmetry.\"\n\n16\n\n\fTuraev about G-equivariant theories in the simple case when the group G is ZZ/2. Indeed\na spin theory is very similar to - but not the same as - a ZZ/2-equivariant theory, which\nis the structure obtained when the surfaces are equipped with principal ZZ/2-bundles (i.e.\ndouble coverings) rather than spin structures. We shall discuss equivariant theories in \u00a77.\n(One difference is that in the equivariant case the ZZ/2 action is nontrivial in the sector C1\n\nand trivial in Cg , precisely the opposite of what we have found in the spin case.) Comparing\n\nwith the equivariant theory, the surprising result that the product on Cr is naive-symmetric\ncan be understood as twisted-anticommutativity.\n\nIt seems reasonable to call a spin theory semisimple if the algebra Cns is semisimple,\n\ni.e. is the algebra of functions on a finite set X. Then Cr is the space of sections of a\nvector bundle E on X, and it follows from the condition \u03c7ns = \u03c7r that the fibre at each\n\npoint must have dimension 1. Thus the whole structure is determined by the Frobenius\nalgebra Cns together with the binary choice of the grading of the fibre of the line bundle\nE at each point.\n\nWe can now see that if we had used the graded symmetry in defining the tensor\ncategory we should have forced the grading of Cr to be purely even. For on the odd part\n\nthe inner product would have had to be skew, and that is impossible on a 1-dimensional\n\nspace. And if both Cns and Cr are purely even then the theory is in fact completely\nindependent of the spin structures on the surfaces.\n\nA concrete example of a two-dimensional topological-spin theory is given by C = C\u2295C\u03b7\n\nwhere \u03b7 2 = 1 and \u03b7 is odd. The Euler elements are \u03c7e = 1 and \u03c7o = \u22121. It follows that\n\nthe partition function of a closed surface with spin structure is \u00b11 according as the spin\n\nstructure is even or odd. (To prove this it is useful to compute the Arf invariant of the\nquadratic refinement of the intersection product associated to the spin structure and to\nnote that it is multiplicative for adding handles.)\nThe most common theories defined on surfaces with spin structure are not topological:\nthey are 2-dimensional conformal field theories with N = 1 supersymmetry. The general\n\nfeatures of the structure are still as we have described, but it should be noticed that if\nthe theory is not topological one does not expect the grading on Cns to be purely even:\n\nstates can change sign on rotation by 2\u03c0. If a surface \u03a3 has a conformal structure then a\n\ndouble covering of the non-zero tangent vectors is the complement of the zero-section in a\ntwo-dimensional real vector bundle L on \u03a3 which is called the spin bundle. The covering\n17\n\n\fmap then extends to a symmetric pairing of vector bundles L \u2297 L \u2192 T \u03a3, which if we\n\nregard L and T \u03a3 as complex line bundles in the natural way, induces an isomorphism\nL \u2297C L \u223c\n= T \u03a3. An N = 1 superconformal field theory is a conformal-spin theory with an\nadditional map\n\u0393(S; L) \u2297 HS,L \u2192 HS,L\n\n(2.20)\n\n(\u03c3, \u03c8) 7\u2192 G\u03c3 \u03c8\n\n(2.21)\n\nsuch that G\u03c3 is real-linear in the section \u03c3 of L and satisfies G2\u03c3 = D\u03c32 , where D\u03c32 is\nthe Virasoro action of the vector field \u03c3 2 . Furthermore, when we have a cobordism (\u03a3, L)\nfrom (S0 , L0 ) to (S1 , L1 ) and a holomorphic section \u03c3 of L which restricts to \u03c3i on Si we\nhave the intertwining property\nG\u03c31 \u25e6 U\u03a3,L = U\u03a3,L \u25e6 G\u03c30 .\nExample 2\n\n(2.22)\n\nWe define topological-spinc theories, which model 2d theories with N = 2\n\nsupersymmetry, by replacing \"manifolds\" with \"manifolds with spinc -structure\".\n\nA spinc -structure on a surface with a conformal structure is a pair of holomorphic line\nbundles L1 , L2 with an isomorphism L1 \u2297 L2 \u223c\n= T \u03a3 of holomorphic line bundles. A spin\nstructure is the particular case when L1 = L2 . An N = 2 superconformal theory assigns\na vector space HS;L1 ,L2 to each 1-manifold S with spinc -structure, and an operator\nUS0 ;L1 ,L2 : HS0 ;L1 ,L2 \u2192 HS1 ;L1 ,L2\n\n(2.23)\n\nto each spinc -cobordism from S0 to S1 . To explain the rest of the structure we need to define\nthe N = 2 Lie superalgebra associated to a spinc 1-manifold (S; L1 , L2 ). Let G = Aut(L1 )\ndenote the group of bundle isomorphisms L1 \u2192 L1 which cover diffeomorphisms of S.\n\n(We can identify this group with Aut(L2 ).) Its Lie algebra Lie(G) is an extension of\nVect(S) by \u03a90 (S). Let \u039b0S;L1 ,L2 denote the complex Lie algebra obtained from Lie(G)\nby complexifying Vect(S). This is the even part of a Lie superalgebra whose odd part is\n\u039b1S;L1 ,L2 = \u0393(L1 ) \u2295 \u0393(L2 ). The bracket \u039b1 \u2297 \u039b1 \u2192 \u039b0 is completely determined by the\nproperty that elements of \u0393(L1 ) and of \u0393(L2 ) anticommute among themselves, while the\ncomposite\n\u0393(L1 ) \u2297 \u0393(L2 ) \u2192 \u039b1 \u2192 VectC (S)\ntakes (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) to \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u2208 \u0393(T S).\n18\n\n(2.24)\n\n\fIn an N = 2 theory we require the superalgebra \u039b(S; L1 , L2 ) to act on the vector\n\nspace HS;L1 ,L2 , compatibly with the action of the group G, and with a similar intertwining\n\nproperty with the cobordism operators to that of the N = 1 case. For an N = 2 theory\nthe state space always has an action of the circle group coming from its embedding in G\n\nas the group of fibrewise multiplications on L1 and L2 . Equivalently, the state space is\nalways ZZ-graded.\nAn N = 2 theory always gives rise to two ordinary conformal field theories by equip-\n\nping a surface \u03a3 with the spinc structures (C, T \u03a3) and (T \u03a3,C). These are called the\n\n\"A-model\" and the \"B-model\" associated to the N = 2 theory. In each case the state\n\nspaces are cochain complexes in which the differential is the action of the constant section\n1 of the trivial component of the spinc -structure.\n\nCochain level theories\nThe most important \"generalization,\" however, of the open and closed topological\nfield theory we have described is the one of which it is intended to be a toy model. In\nclosed string theory the central object is the vector space C = CS 1 of states of a single\n\nparametrized string. This has an integer grading by the \"ghost number\", and an operator\nQ : C \u2192 C called the \"BRST operator\" which raises the ghost number by 1 and satisfies\n\nQ2 = 0. In other words, C is a cochain complex. If we think of the string as moving\n\nin a space-time M then C is roughly the space of differential forms defined along the\n\norbits of the action of the reparametrization group Diff+ (S 1 ) on the free loop space LM .\n(More precisely, square-integrable forms of semi-infinite degree.) Similarly, the space C\n\nof a topologically-twisted N = 2 supersymmetric theory, as just described, is a cochain\n\ncomplex which models the space of semi-infinite differential forms on the loop space of\na K\u00e4hler manifold - in this case, all square-integrable differential forms, not just those\nalong the orbits of Diff+ (S 1 ). In both kinds of example, a cobordism \u03a3 from p circles to q\ncircles gives an operator U\u03a3,\u03bc : C \u2297p \u2192 C \u2297q which depends on a conformal structure \u03bc on\n\n\u03a3. This operator is a cochain map, but its crucial feature is that changing the conformal\n\nstructure \u03bc on \u03a3 changes the operator U\u03a3,\u03bc only by a cochain-homotopy. The cohomology\nH(C) = ker(Q)/im(Q) - the \"space of physical states\" in conventional string theory - is\ntherefore the state space of a topological field theory. (In the usual string theory situation\nthe topological field theory we obtain is not very interesting, for the BRST cohomology is\nconcentrated in one or two degrees, and there is a \"grading anomaly\" which means that\n19\n\n\fthe operator associated to a cobordism \u03a3 changes the degree by a multiple of the Euler\nnumber \u03c7(\u03a3). In the case of the N = 2 supersymmetric models, however, there is no\ngrading anomaly, and the full structure is visible.)\nA good way to describe how the operator U\u03a3,\u03bc varies with \u03bc is as follows.\nIf M\u03a3 is the moduli space of conformal structures on the cobordism \u03a3, modulo dif-\n\nfeomorphisms of \u03a3 which are the identity on the boundary circles, then we have a cochain\nmap\nU\u03a3 : C \u2297p \u2192 \u03a9(M\u03a3 ; C \u2297q )\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere the right-hand side is the de Rham complex of forms on M\u03a3 with values in C \u2297q .\n\nThe operator U\u03a3,\u03bc is obtained from U\u03a3 by restricting from M\u03a3 to {\u03bc}. The composition\n\nproperty when two cobordisms \u03a31 and \u03a32 are concatenated is that the diagram\nC \u2297p\n\u2193\n\n\u03a9(M\u03a32 \u25e6\u03a31 ; C\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2297r\n\n)\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03a9(M\u03a31\n\n\u03a9(M\u03a31 ; C \u2297q )\n\u2193\n\u2297r\n\u00d7 M\u03a32 ; C ) = \u03a9(M\u03a31 ; \u03a9(M\u03a32 ; C \u2297r ))\n\n(2.26)\n\ncommutes, where the lower horizontal arrow in induced by the map M\u03a31 \u00d7M\u03a32 \u2192 M\u03a32 \u25e6\u03a31\nwhich expresses concatenation of the conformal structures.\n\nMany variants of this formulation are possible. For example, we might prefer to give\na cochain map\nU\u03a3 : C.(M\u03a3 ) \u2192 (C \u2297p )\u2217 \u2297 C \u2297q ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhere C.(M\u03a3 ) is, say, the complex of smooth singular chains of M\u03a3 . We may also prefer\n\nto use the moduli spaces of Riemannian structures instead of conformal structures.\n\nThere is no difficulty in passing from the closed-string picture just presented to an\nopen and closed theory. We shall not discuss these cochain-level theories in any depth in\nthis work, but it is important to realize that they are the real objective. We shall now\npoint out a few basic things about them. A much fuller discussion can be found in Costello\n[25].\nFor each pair a, b of boundary conditions we shall still have a vector space - indeed\na cochain complex - Oab , but it is no longer the space of morphisms from b to a in a\n\ncategory. Rather, what we have is, in the terminology of Fukaya, Kontsevich, and others,\n\nan A\u221e -category. This means that instead of a composition law Oab \u00d7 Obc \u2192 Oac we\n20\n\n\fhave a family of ways of composing, parametrized by the contractible space of conformal\nstructures on the surface of fig. 1. In particular, any two choices of a composition law from\nthe family are cochain-homotopic. Composition is associative in the sense that we have a\ncontractible family of triple compositions Oab \u00d7 Obc \u00d7 Ocd \u2192 Oad , which contains all the\nmaps obtained by choosing a binary composition law from the given family and bracketing\nthe triple in either of the two possible ways.\nNote This is not the usual way of defining an A\u221e -structure. According to Stasheff's\noriginal definition, an A\u221e -structure on a space X consists of a sequence of choices: first,\na composition law m2 : X \u00d7 X \u2192 X; then, a choice of a map\nm3 : [0, 1] \u00d7 X \u00d7 X \u00d7 X \u2192 X\nwhich is a homotopy between (x, y, z) 7\u2192 m2 (m2 (x, y), z) and (x, y, z) 7\u2192 m2 (x, m2 (y, z));\nthen, a choice of a map\n\nm4 : C2 \u00d7 X 4 \u2192 X,\nwhere C2 is a convex plane polygon whose vertices are indexed by the five ways of bracketing\na 4-fold product, and m4 |((\u2202C2 ) \u00d7 X 4 ) is determined by m3 ; and so on.\n\nThere is an analogous definition - in fact slightly simpler - applying to cochain\n\ncomplexes rather than spaces. These definitions, however, are essentially equivalent to the\none above coming from 2-dimensional field theory: the only important point is to have a\ncontractible family of k-fold compositions for each k. (A discussion of the relation between\nthe definitions can be found in [26].)\nApart from the composition law, the essential algebraic properties we have found in\nour theories are the non-degenerate inner product, and the commutativity of the closed\nalgebra C. Concerning the latter, when we pass to cochain theories the multiplication in\n\nC will of course be commutative up to cochain homotopy, but, unlike what happened with\n\nthe open-string composition, the moduli space M\u03a3 of closed-string multiplications, i.e.\nthe moduli space of conformal structures on a pair of pants \u03a3, modulo diffeomorphisms\n\nof \u03a3 which are the identity on the boundary circles, is not contractible: it contains a\nnatural circle of multiplications, and there are two different natural homotopies between\nthe multiplication and the reversed multiplication. This might be a clue to an important\ndifference between stringy and classical space-times. The closed string cochain complex C\n\nis the string-theory substitute for the de Rham complex of space-time, an algebra whose\n21\n\n\fmultiplication is associative and (graded-)commutative on the nose. Over the rationals or\nthe real or complex numbers, such cochain algebras are known by the work of Sullivan [27]\nand Quillen [28] to model8 the category of topological spaces up to homotopy, in the sense\nthat to each such algebra C we can associate a space XC and a homomorphism of cochain\nalgebras from C to the de Rham complex of XC which is a cochain homotopy equivalence.\nIf we do not want to ignore torsion in the homology of spaces we can no longer encode\nthe homotopy type in a strictly commutative cochain algebra. Instead, we must replace\ncommutative algebras with so-called E\u221e -algebras, i.e., roughly, cochain complexes C over\nthe integers equipped with a multiplication which is associative and commutative up to\ngiven arbitrarily high-order homotopies. An arbitrary space X has an E\u221e -algebra CX of\ncochains, and conversely one can associate a space XC to each E\u221e -algebra C. Thus we have\na pair of adjoint functors, just as in rational homotopy theory. A long evolution in algebraic\ntopology has culminated in recent theorems of Mandell [29] which show that the actual\nhomotopy category of topological spaces is more or less equivalent to the category of E\u221e algebras. The cochain algebras of closed string theory have less higher commutativity than\ndo E\u221e -algebras, and this may be an indication that we are dealing with non-commutative\nspaces in Connes's sense: that fits in well with the interpretation of the B-field of a string\nbackground as corresponding to a bundle of matrix algebras on space-time. At the same\ntime, the nondegenerate inner product on C - corresponding to Poincar\u00e9 duality - seems\nto show we are concerned with manifolds, rather than more singular spaces.\nFor readers not accustomed to working with cochain complexes it may be worth saying\na few words about what one gains by doing so. To take the simplest example, let us consider\nthe category K of cochain complexes of finitely generated free abelian groups and cochainhomotopy classes of cochain maps. This is called the derived category of the category of\nfinitely generated abelian groups. Passing to cohomology gives us a functor from K to the\ncategory of ZZ-graded finitely generated abelian groups. In fact the subcategory K0 of K\nconsisting of complexes whose cohomology vanishes except in degree 0 is actually equivalent\n8\n\nIn this and the following sentence we are overlooking subtleties related to the fundamental\n\ngroup.\n\n22\n\n\fto the category of finitely generated abelian groups.9 But the category K inherits from the\ncategory of finitely generated free abelian groups a duality functor with properties as ideal\nas one could wish: each object is isomorphic to its double dual, and dualizing preserves\nexact sequences. (The dual C \u2217 of a complex C is defined by (C \u2217 )i = Hom(C \u2212i ; ZZ).) There\nis no such nice duality in the category of finitely generated abelian groups. Indeed, the\nsubcategory K0 is not closed under duality, for the dual of the complex CA corresponding\n\nto a group A has in general two non-vanishing cohomology groups: Hom(A; ZZ) in degree\n0, and in degree +1 the finite group Ext(A; ZZ) Pontrjagin-dual to the torsion subgroup of\nA. This follows from the exact sequence (not to be confused with the cochain complex):\n0 \u2192 Hom(A, ZZ) \u2192 Hom(FA , ZZ) \u2192 Hom(RA , ZZ) \u2192 Ext(A, ZZ) \u2192 0\n\n(2.28)\n\nThe category K also has a tensor product with better properties than the tensor\n\nproduct of abelian groups (which does not preserve exact sequences), and, better still,\nthere is a canonical cochain functor from (locally well-behaved) compact spaces to K which\n\ntakes Cartesian products to tensor products. (The simplicial, \u010cech, and other candidates\n\nfor the cochain complex of a space are canonically isomorphic in K.)\nWe shall return to this discussion in \u00a76.\n\n3. Solutions of the algebraic conditions: the semisimple case\n3.1. Classification theorem\nWe now turn to the question : given a closed string theory C, what is the corresponding\n\ncategory of boundary conditions? In our formulation this becomes the question: given a\ncommutative Frobenius algebra C, what are the possible Oab 's?\n9\n\nTo an abelian group A one can associate the cochain complex\nCA = ( * * * \u2192 0 \u2192 RA \u2192 FA \u2192 0 \u2192 * * * ),\n\nwhere FA is a free abelian group (in degree 0) with a surjective map FA \u2192 A, and RA is the\nkernel of FA \u2192 A. The choice of FA is far from unique, but nevertheless the different choices of\nCA are canonically isomorphic objects of K.\n\n23\n\n\fWe can answer this question in the case when C is semisimple. We will take C to be\n\nan algebra over the complex numbers, and in this case the most useful characterization of\nsemisimplicity is that the \"fusion rules\"\n\u03c6\u03bc \u03c6\u03bd = N\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03c6\u03bb\n\n(3.1)\n\nare diagonalizable.10 That is, the matrices L(\u03c6\u03bc ) of the left-regular representation, with\nmatrix elements N\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb , are simultaneously diagonalizable.\nEquivalently, there is a set of basic idempotents \u03b5x such that\nC = \u2295xC\u03b5x\n\u03b5x \u03b5y = \u03b4xy \u03b5y\n\n(3.2)\n\nEquivalently, yet again, C is the algebra of complex-valued functions on the finite set\n\nX = Spec(C) of characters of C.\n\nThe trace \u03b8C : C \u2192 C, which should be thought of as a \"dilaton field\" on the finite\n\nspace-time Spec(C), is completely described by the unordered set of non-zero complex\nnumbers\n\u03b8x := \u03b8C (\u03b5x )\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is the only invariant of a finite dimensional commutative semisimple Frobenius\nalgebra.\nIt should be mentioned that the most general finite dimensional commutative algebra\nover the complex numbers is of the form C = \u2295Cx , where x runs through the set Spec(C),\n\nand Cx is a local ring, i.e. Cx = C\u03b5x \u2295 mx , with \u03b5x as in (3.2) , and mx a nilpotent ideal. If\n\nC is a Frobenius algebra, then so is each Cx , and there is some \u03bdx for which \u03b8C : m\u03bdxx \u2192 C\nis an isomorphism, while m\u03bdxx +1 = 0. Let us write \u03c9x \u2208 m\u03bdxx for the element such that\n\n\u03b8C (\u03c9x ) = 1. The element \u03c9 of C with components \u03c9x can be regarded as a \"volume form\"\n\non space-time. (A typical example of such a local Frobenius algebra Cx is the cohomology\n\nring - with complex coefficients - of complex projective space IPn of dimension n. The\n\ncohomology ring is generated by a single 2-dimensional class t which satisfies tn+1 = 0.\nThe trace is given by integration over IPn , and takes tk to 1 if k = n, and to 0 otherwise.\nThus \u03c9x = tn here.)\n10\n\nThe structure constants N\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb need not be integral, though in many interesting examples there\n\nis a basis for the algebra in which they are integral.\n\n24\n\n\fA useful technical fact about Frobenius algebras - not necessarily commutative -\nP\nis that, in the notation of (2.11) , the \"Euler\" element \u03c7 =\n\u03c8\u03bc \u03c8 \u03bc is invertible if and\nonly if the algebra is semisimple\n\n11\n\n, which in the general case means that the algebra is\n\nisomorphic to a sum of full matrix algebras. The element \u03c7 always belongs to the centre\nof the algebra; in the commutative case it has components dim(Cx )\u03c9x .\nIn the semisimple case we have the following complete characterization of the possible\nopen algebras Oaa compatible with a fixed closed algebra C. Unfortunately, though, the\narguments we use do not work for graded Frobenius algebras.\n\nTheorem 2: If C is semisimple then O = Oaa is semisimple for each a and necessarily of\n\nthe form O = EndC (W ) for some finite dimensional representation W of C.\n\nProof: The images \u03b9a (\u03b5x ) = Px are central simple idempotents. Therefore Ox =\nPx O = Px OPx is an algebra over the Frobenius algebra Cx = \u03b5x C \u223c\n= C, and so it suffices\n\nto work over a single space-time point. Then \u03b9a (1Ox ) = \u03b11Cx for some element \u03b1 \u2208 C. By\nthe Cardy condition\n\n\u03b11Ox = \u03c7Ox =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03bc \u03c8 \u03bc\n\n(3.4)\n\nApplying \u03b8 we find \u03b1 = dim Ox , and hence \u03c7Ox is invertible if Ox 6= 0. It follows that\n\nOx is semisimple at each point x, i.e. a sum of matrix algebras \u2295i End(Wi ). In fact, the\n\nCardy condition shows that there can be at most one summand Wi at each point, i.e. the\nalgebra is simple. For the map \u03c0 : Ox \u2192 Ox must take each summand End(Wi ) into itself,\nand cannot factor through the 1-dimensional Cx if more than one Wi is non-zero. \u2660\n\nAccording to Theorem 2 the most general Oaa is obtained by choosing a vector space\n\nWx,a for each basic idempotent \u03b5x , i.e. a vector bundle on the finite space-time X =\nSpec(C), and forming:\nOaa = \u2295x End(Wx,a ).\n11\n\n(3.5)\n\nTo see this, one observes that for any element \u03c8 of the algebra we have \u03b8(\u03c8\u03c7) = tr(\u03c8), where\n\ntr(\u03c8) denotes the trace of \u03c8 in the regular representation. As the pairing (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) 7\u2192 \u03b8(\u03c81 \u03c82 ) is\nnondegenerate, it follows that the trace-form (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) 7\u2192 tr(\u03c81 \u03c82 ) is nondegenerate if and only if\n\u03c7 is invertible, and non-degeneracy of the trace-form is well-known to be a criterion for a finite\ndimensional algebra to be semisimple. There are several definitions of semisimplicity, and their\nequivalence amounts to the classical theorem of Wedderburn. For our purposes, a semisimple\nalgebra is just a sum of full matrix algebras.\n\n25\n\n\fBut let us notice that when we have an algebra of the form End(W ) the vector space W\nis determined by the algebra only up to tensoring with an arbitrary complex line: any\nirreducible representation of the algebra will do for W .\nElements \u03c8 \u2208 Oaa will be denoted \u03c8 = \u2295\u03c8x . Let Px be the projection operator onto\n\nthe xth summand. From the equation\n\n\u03b9a (\u03b5x ) = Px\n\n(3.6)\n\nthe adjoint relation and the Cardy condition determine the relations:\n\u03b8a (\u03c8) =\n\nXp\n\u03b8x Tr(\u03c8x )\nx\n\n\u03b5x\n\u03b9 (\u03c8) = \u2295x Tr(\u03c8x ) \u221a\n\u03b8x\n1\n\u03c0b a (\u03c8aa ) = \u2295x \u221a TrWx,a (\u03c8x,aa )Px,b\n\u03b8x\na\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u03b5\n(one must use the same square-root in the formula for \u03b8O and \u03b9a .) Note that \u03b8C ( \u221a\u03b5\u03b8x \u221ay ) =\nx\n\n\u03b4x,y , i.e. the elements\n\n\u221a\u03b5x\n\u03b8x\n\n\u03b8y\n\nform a natural orthonormal basis for C. Thus, a boundary\n\ncondition a gives us a tuple of positive integers wx = dim Wx , one for each basic idempotent,\n\u221a\nas well as a choice of the square-root \u03b8x . The relation (2.5), however, shows that these\n\nsquare-roots are an intrinsic property of the Frobenius category B, and do not depend on\n\nwhich particular object in it we are considering.\n\nLet us now determine the Oaa \u00d7 Obb bimodules Oab associated to a pair of boundary\n\nconditions a, b. These are again fixed by the Cardy condition.\nLemma: When C is semisimple we have\nOab \u223c\n= \u2295x Hom(Wx,a ; Wx,b )\n\n(3.8)\n\nProof: Restricting to each Oaa we can invoke Theorem 2. Then the \u03b9a (\u03b5x )Oab = Oab \u03b9b (\u03b5x )\n\nare bimodules for the simple algebras Ox,aa and Ox,bb . We restrict to a single idempotent\n\nand drop the x, that is, we take C = C. The only irreducible representation of Oaa =\nEnd(Wa ) is Wa itself, and the only Oaa \u00d7 Obb -bimodule is W \u2217 \u2297 Wb . Therefore, Oab \u223c\n=\na\n\nnab Wa\u2217\n\n\u2297 Wb , where nab is a nonnegative integer. Let us work out the Cardy condition. If\n\n\u2217\nvm is a basis for Wa and wn is a basis for Wb then a basis for Oab is vm,\u03b1\n\u2297 wn,\u03b1 where\n\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . , nab . Then \u03c0(\u03c8) = nab trWa (\u03c8)Pb . Comparing to \u03b9b \u03b9a (\u03c8) we get nab = 1. \u2660\n26\n\n\fWe can now describe the maximal category B of boundary conditions. We first observe\n\nthat if p \u2208 Oaa is a projection -i.e. p2 = p -we can assume that a = b \u2295 c in B, where\n\nb is the image of p. For we can adjoin images of projections to any additive category in\nmuch the same way as we adjoined direct sums. If the closed algebra C is semisimple we\n\ncan therefore choose an object ax of B for each space-time point x so that ax is supported\nat x - i.e. \u03b9ax (\u03b5x )Oax ax = Oax ax - and is simple, i.e. Oax ax = C. For any object b of B\nwe then have a canonical morphism\n\n\u2295x Obax \u2297 ax \u2192 b,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere on the left we have used the possibility of tensoring any object of a linear category\nby a finite dimensional vector space. Furthermore, it follows from the lemma that the\nmorphism (3.9) is an isomorphism, for both sides have the same space of morphisms into\nany other object c. Finally, notice that ax is unique up to tensoring with a line Lx , for if\na\u2032 is another choice then a\u2032 \u223c\n= ax \u2297 Lx , where Lx = Oa a\u2032 .\nx\n\nx\n\nx x\n\nTheorem 3\n(i) If C is semisimple, corresponding to a space-time X, then the category B of boundary\nconditions is equivalent to the category Vect(X) of vector bundles on X, by the inverse\n\nfunctors\n{Wx } 7\u2192 \u2295Wx \u2297 ax ,\na 7\u2192 {Oax a }.\n\n(3.10)\n\n(3.11)\n\n(ii) The equivalence of B with Vect(X) is unique up to transformations Vect(X) \u2192\nVect(X) given by tensoring with a line bundle L = {Lx } on X.\n\n\u221a\n(iii) The Frobenius structure on B is determined by choosing a square-root { \u03b8 x } of the\ndilaton field. It is therefore unique up to multiplication by an element \u03c3 \u2208 C such\nthat \u03c3 2 = 1.\n\nRemarks\n1. A boundary condition a has a support\nsupp(a) = {x \u2208 X : Wx 6= 0}\n27\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fcontained in X = spec(C). If two boundary conditions a and b have the same support\nthen Oab is a Morita equivalence bimodule between Oaa and Obb . The reader might\n\nwish to compare this discussion to section 6.4 of [30]. Note that it is necessary to\ninvoke the Cardy condition to draw this conclusion.\n2. Examples of semisimple Frobenius algebras in physics include:\na) The fusion rule algebra (Verlinde algebra) of a RCFT.\nb) The chiral ring of an N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg theory for generic superpotential W\n\n(that is, as long as all the critical points of W are Morse critical points). This is the case\nwhen the IR theory is massive.\nc) Generic quantum cohomology of manifolds.\n3.2. Comment on B-fields\nWe can see from this discussion just where the idea of a B-field would appear, though\nin fact on a 0-dimensional space-time any B-field must be trivial. We showed that there\nis a category of boundary conditions associated to each point of space time, and that it\nis isomorphic to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces, though not canonically.\nMore precisely, it contains minimal - i.e. irreducible - objects from which any other\nobject can be obtained by tensoring with a finite dimensional vector space.\nNow a B-field is in essence a bundle of categories on space-time in which the fibrecategories are all isomorphic but not canonically. We can suppose that each fibre is isomorphic to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. The crucial feature is that\nthe ambiguity in identifying each fibre with the standard fibre is a \"group\" - in this case\nactually a category - of equivalences whose elements are complex lines and in which composition is given by the tensor product. Our category of boundary conditions is precisely\nthe category of \"sections\" of a bundle of categories with this structural group.\nIt may be helpful to think of this in the following way. An electromagnetic field is a\nline bundle with connection on space-time. It is something we can think of as part of the\nstructure of space-time, and makes sense in the absence of fermions. But in a theory with\nfermions there is a spinor-space at each point of space-time, and the electromagnetic field\nis \"really\" the information about how the spinor spaces are connected together from point\nto point of space-time. In this sense the electromagmetic field \"is\" the spinor-bundle with\nits connection. A B-field similarly \"is\" the bundle of boundary conditions.\nOn a general topological space X the classes of B-fields are classified by the elements\nof the cohomology group H 3 (X; ZZ), which can be understood as H 1 (X; G), where G is the\n28\n\n\f\"group\" of line bundles under tensor product, which in algebraic topology is an EilenbergMaclane object of type K(ZZ, 2). We shall return to this topic in \u00a77.\n3.3. Reconstructing the closed algebra\nWhen we have an open and closed TFT each element \u03be of the closed algebra C defines\n\nan endomorphism \u03bea = ia (\u03be) \u2208 Oaa of each object a of B, and \u03b7 \u25e6 \u03bea = \u03beb \u25e6 \u03b7 for each\n\nmorphism \u03b7 \u2208 Oba from a to b. The family {\u03bea } thus constitutes a natural transformation\nfrom the identity functor 1B : B \u2192 B to itself.\n\nFor any C-linear category B we can consider the ring E of natural transformations of\n\n1B . It is automatically commutative, for if {\u03bea }, {\u03b7a } \u2208 E then \u03bea \u25e6 \u03b7a = \u03b7a \u25e6 \u03bea by the\ndefinition of naturality. If B is a Frobenius category then there is a map \u03c0a b : Obb \u2192 Oaa\n\nfor each pair of objects a, b, and we can define j b : Obb \u2192 E by j b (\u03b7)a = \u03c0a b (\u03b7) for \u03b7 \u2208 Obb .\n\nIn other words, j b is defined so that the Cardy condition \u03b9a \u25e6 j b = \u03c0a b holds. But the\n\nquestion arises whether we can define a trace \u03b8 : E \u2192 C to make E into a Frobenius algebra,\nand with the property that\n\n\u03b8a (\u03b9a (\u03be).\u03b7) = \u03b8(\u03be.j a(\u03b7))\n\n(3.13)\n\nfor all \u03be \u2208 E and \u03b7 \u2208 Oaa . This is certainly true if B is a semisimple Frobenius category\n\nwith finitely many simple objects, for then E is just the ring of complex-valued functions\n\non the set of classes of these simple elements, and we can readily define \u03b8 : E \u2192 C\n\nby \u03b8(\u03b5a ) = \u03b8a (1a )2 , where a is an irreducible object, and \u03b5a \u2208 E is the characteristic\n\nfunction of the point a in the spectrum of E. Nevertheless, a Frobenius category need not\n\nbe semisimple, and we cannot, unfortunately, take E as the closed string algebra in the\ngeneral case. If, for example, B has just one object a, and Oaa is a commutative local\nring of dimension greater than 1, then E = Oaa , and so \u03b9a : E \u2192 Oaa is an isomorphism,\n\nand its adjoint map j a ought to be an isomorphism too. But that contradicts the Cardy\nP\ncondition, as \u03c0a a is multiplication by \u03c8i \u03c8 i , which must be nilpotent. In \u00a76 we shall give\n\nan example of two distinct closed string Frobenius algebras which admit the same open\nstring algebra Oaa .\n\nThe commutative algebra E of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor of a\n\nlinear category B is called the Hochschild cohomology HH 0 (B) of B in degree 0. The\n\ngroups HH p (B) for p > 0, whose definition will be given in a moment, vanish if B is\n\nsemisimple, but in the general case they appear to be relevant to the construction of a\nclosed string algebra from B. Let us notice meanwhile that for any Frobenius category B\n\nthere is a natural homomorphism K(B) \u2192 HH 0 (B) from the Grothendieck group12 of B,\n12\n\nI.e. the group formed from the semigroup of isomorphism classes of objects of B under \u2295.\n\n29\n\n\fwhich assigns to an object a the transformation whose value on b is \u03c0b a (1a ) \u2208 Obb . In the\nsemisimple case this homomorphism induces an isomorphism K(B) \u2297 C \u2192 HH 0 (B).\n\nFor any additive category B the Hochschild cohomology is defined as the cohomology\nof the cochain complex in which a k-cochain F is a rule that to each composable k-tuple\nof morphisms\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c6k\n\nY0 \u2192 Y1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Yk\n\n(3.14)\n\nassigns F (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k ) \u2208 Hom(Y0 ; Yk ). The differential in the complex is defined by\n(dF )(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k+1 ) =F (\u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6k+1 ) \u25e6 \u03c61 +\n+\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(\u22121)i F (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6i+1 \u25e6 \u03c6i , . . . , \u03c6k+1 )\n\n(3.15)\n\n+ (\u22121)k+1 \u03c6k+1 \u25e6 F (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k ).\n(Notice, in particular, that a 0-cochain assigns an endomorphism FY to each object Y , and\nis a cocycle if the endomorphisms form a natural transformation. Similarly, a 2-cochain\nF gives a possible infinitesimal deformation F (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) of the composition-law (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) 7\u2192\n\u03c62 \u25e6 \u03c61 of the category, and the deformation preserves the associativity of composition if\nand only if F is a cocycle.)\nIn the case of a category B with a single object whose algebra of endomorphisms is O\nthe cohomology just described is usually called the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra\nO with coefficients in O regarded as a O-bimodule. This must be carefully distinguished\n\nfrom the Hochschild cohomology with coefficients in the dual O-bimodule O\u2217 . But if O is a\nFrobenius algebra it is isomorphic as a bimodule to O\u2217 , and the two notions of Hochschild\n\ncohomology need not be distinguished. The same applies to a Frobenius category B:\nbecause Hom(Yk ; Y0 ) is the dual space of Hom(Y0 ; Yk ) we can think of a k-cochain as a\nrule which associates to each composable k-tuple (3.14) of morphisms a linear function of\nan element \u03c60 \u2208 Hom(Yk ; Y0 ). In other words, a k-cochain is a rule which to each \"circle\"\nof k + 1 morphisms\n\u03c60\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c6k\n\n\u03c60\n\n* * * \u2192 Y0 \u2192 Y1 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Yk \u2192 * * *\nassigns a complex number F (\u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k ).\n30\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fFig. 13: A cyclic pairing of a closed string state \u03c6 with k + 1 open string states.\n\nIf in this description we restrict ourselves to cochains which are cyclically invariant under rotating the circle of morphisms (\u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k ) then we obtain a sub-cochain-complex\nof the Hochschild complex whose cohomology is called the cyclic cohomology HC \u2217 (B) of\nthe category B. The cyclic cohomology - which evidently maps to the Hochschild coho-\n\nmology - is a more natural candidate for the closed string algebra associated to B than\n\nis the Hochschild cohomology (for a state represented by the vector (3.16) pairs in a cycli-\n\ncally invariant way with a closed string state to give a number, in virtue of fig. 13). In our\nbaby examples the cyclic and Hochschild cohomology are indistinguishable, but it is worth\npointing out13 that while HH 2 (B) is, as indicated above, the space of infinitesimal deformations of B as a category, the group HC 2 (B) is its space of infinitesimal deformations as\na Frobenius category.\n\nA very natural Frobenius category on which to test these ideas is the category of\nholomorphic vector bundles on a compact Calabi-Yau manifold: that example will be\ndiscussed in \u00a76.\n3.4. Spin theories and mod 2 graded categories\nLet us give a brief outline, without proofs, of the modifications of the preceding discussion which are needed to describe the category of boundary conditions for a topological-spin\ntheory as defined in \u00a72.6.\n\nThere is just one spin structure on an interval, and its automorphism group is (\u00b11),\n\nso for each pair of boundary conditions a, b the vector space Oab will have an involution,\ni.e. a mod 2 grading. The bilinear composition Oab \u2297 Obc \u2192 Oac will preserve the grading.\n\nThere is a non-degenerate trace \u03b8a : Oaa \u2192 C which satisfies the commutativity condition\n\n(2.5) (without signs).\n13\n\nAs we learnt from Kontsevich\n\n31\n\n\fIf the closed theory is described by a Frobenius algebra C = Cns \u2295 Cr , as in \u00a72.6, there\n\nwill be adjoint maps\n\n\u03b9ns\na : Cns \u2192 Oaa\n\u03b9ans : Oaa \u2192 Cns\n\u03b9ra : Cr \u2192 Oaa\n\n(3.17)\n\n\u03b9ar : Caa \u2192 Cr\nr\nwhich preserve the grading. Moreover and \u03b9ns\na and \u03b9a fit together to define a homomorphism\n\nof algebras C \u2192 Oaa . The centrality condition becomes\nns\n\u03b9ns\na (\u03c6)\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03b9a (\u03c6)\n\n\u03b9ra (\u03c6)\u03c8 = (\u22121)deg \u03c6 deg \u03c8+deg \u03c8 \u03c8\u03b9ra (\u03c6)\n\n(3.18)\n\nThus, \u03b9ns maps into the naive center of the algebra Oaa . The reason we get the naive\n\ncentre here, rather than the graded-algebra centre, and also the reason that the trace is\nnaively commutative, is the same as that given in \u00a72.6 for the naive commutativity of the\nalgebra C. The sign for \u03b9r is obtained by carefully following the choices of sections of the\n\nspin bundle one chooses under the diffeomorphism in figure 8.\nThere are two Cardy conditions\nb\na\n\u03b9ns\na \u03b9ns (\u03c8) = \u03c0b (\u03c8) :=\n\n\u03b9ra \u03b9br (\u03c8) = \u03c0\u0303ba (\u03c8) :=\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)deg \u03c8\u03bc deg \u03c8 \u03c8\u03bc \u03c8\u03c8 \u03bc\n(\u22121)deg \u03c8\u03bc (deg \u03c8+1) \u03c8\u03bc \u03c8\u03c8 \u03bc .\n\n(3.19)\n\nIf we assume the closed algebra is semisimple then, just as before, we can assume that\nCns is the algebra of functions on a finite set X, and we can determine the category of\nboundary conditions point-by-point. In other words, we can assume that C = C[\u03b7], where\n\nthe generator \u03b7 of Cr satisfies \u03b7 2 = 1, but may have either even or odd degree. In either\n\ncase, the argument we have already used shows (by means of the first Cardy formula) that\nthe algebra Oaa is the full matrix algebra of a vector space W . If the degree of \u03b7 is even\n\nthen \u03b9r (\u03b7) = P with P even, P 2 = 1, and P \u03c8P = (\u22121)deg \u03c8 \u03c8. In this case the category\n\nof boundary conditions at the point is equivalent to the category of mod 2 graded vector\nspaces. If, on the other hand, the degree of \u03b7 is odd, then P is odd, P 2 = 1 and P is (naive)\ncentral. The involution of the algebra Oaa corresponds to an involution of the module W ,\nand the action of P is an isomorphism between the two halves of the grading. The even\n\nsubalgebra of Oaa is a full matrix algebra. Thus the category of boundary conditions is\n32\n\n\fthe equivalent to the category of graded representations of the superalgebra C[\u03b7], which\nin turn is equivalent simply to the category of ungraded vector spaces. The Frobenius\nstructure of the open algebra determines that of the closed algebra by taking the square,\nas in the ungraded case. The two cases deg \u03b7 = 0 and deg \u03b7 = 1 are roughly analogous\nto the distinction between the even and odd degree Clifford algebras over the complex\nnumbers.\n\nSuppose, conversely, that we have an arbitrary semisimple mod 2 graded category\nB, i.e. a linear category equipped with an involutory functor S which one thinks of as\nthe flip of the grading. Such a category has two kinds of simple object P : those such\nthat S(P ) \u223c\n= P , and those for which this is not true. The first kind of object generates a\nsubcategory of B isomorphic to the category of vector spaces, and the second kind generates\na subcategory isomorphic to the category of graded vector spaces. Thus any semisimple\ngraded category B is the category of boundary conditions for a unique topological-spin\ntheory.\n\n4. Vector bundles, K-theory, and \"boundary states\"\nIn the semisimple case there is a nice geometrical interpretation of the category B\nof boundary conditions: the possible objects correspond to the vector bundles over the\n\"space-time\" X = Spec(C) associated to C, which is just a finite set of points. The fiber\nabove a point x is just the vector space Wx .\n\nFig. 14: Correlations on the upper half plane with boundary condition a are the\nsame as the closed string amplitude for an insertion of a boundary state Ba .\n\n33\n\n\fLet us now make some comments on \"boundary states\". In the conformal field theory\nliterature one associates to a boundary condition a a corresponding \"state\" Ba in the\nclosed string state space. (Strictly, Ba is an element of the algebraic dual.) Translated\nto the present context Ba \u2208 C. The defining property of the boundary state is that the\ncorrelation functions of operators on a disk with the boundary condition a are equal to the\ncorrelation functions of the closed theory on the sphere obtained by capping off the disk\nwith another disk and inserting the state Ba at the centre of the cap. This is illustrated\nin fig. 14.\nIn equations,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b8a (\u03b9a \u03c61 ) * * * \u03b9a (\u03c6n ) = \u03b8C Ba \u03c61 * * * \u03c6n\n\n(4.1)\n\nfor all \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n . Using the adjoint relation and nondegeneracy of the trace we find that\nBa = \u03b9a (1Oaa )\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe map a 7\u2192 Ba is a natural homomorphism\nK(B) \u2192 C.\n\n(4.3)\n\nP\nThe operator which adds g handles and h =\nha holes, where ha of the holes have\nQ\ng\nha\nthe boundary condition a, is just \u03c7\n(Ba ) , where \u03c7 is the Euler element of C.\nLet us record one simple property of these boundary states. First, using the Cardy\n\ncondition we have\n\u03b8C (Ba Bb ) = \u03b8a (\u03b9a (Bb ))\n= \u03b8a (\u03b9a \u03b9b (1b ))\n= \u03b8a (\u03c0a b (1b ))\n\n(4.4)\n\n= dim Oab\nIn the semisimple case we can give an explicit formula for the the \"boundary state\"\nin terms of the basic idempotents:\nBO = \u03b9\u2217 (1O ) =\n\nX\nx\n\n\u03b5x\n(dim Wx ) \u221a\n\u03b8x\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe formula shows that the boundary states form a positive cone in the unimodular\nlattice LB spanned by the orthonormal basis\n\n\u221a\u03b5x\n\u03b8x\n\nin the closed algebra C. In particular it\n\nfollows from (4.5) that boundary states can only be added with positive integral coefficients.\n34\n\n\fThey are therefore not like quantum mechanical states of branes. The fundamental integral\nstructure is a result of the Cardy condition.\nIt is natural to speculate whether there should be an operation of \"multiplication\" of\nboundary conditions. There are arguments both for and against. The original perspective\non D-branes, according to which they are viewed as \"cycles\" in space-time on which open\nstrings can begin and end, suggests that there should be a multiplication, corresponding to\nthe intersection of cycles. As no multiplication seems to emerge from the toy structure we\nhave developed in this paper one may wonder whether an important ingredient has been\nomitted. Against this there are the following considerations. Our boundary conditions\nseem to correspond more closely to vector bundles - i.e. to K-theory classes - on\nspace-time than to homology cycles: that will be plainer when we consider the equivariant\nsituation in \u00a77. Now the K-theory classes of a ring have a product, coming from the tensor\n\nproduct of modules, only when the ring is commutative; and we have already remarked\nthat the B-fields which are part of the closed string model of space-time seem to encode a\ndegree of noncommutativity. More precisely, D-branes seem to define classes in the twisted\nK-theory of space-time, twisted by the B-field, and the twisted K-theory of a space does\nnot form a ring: the product of two twisted classes is a twisted class corresponding to the\nsum of the twistings of the factors. But in string theory there is no concept of \"turning off\"\nthe B-field to find an underlying untwisted space-time. For example, the conformal field\ntheory corresponding to a torus with a non-zero B-field can be isomorphic by \"T-duality\"\nto a theory coming from another torus with no B-field.\nAnother reason for not expecting a multiplication operation on D-branes also comes\nfrom T-duality in conformal field theory. There the closed string theories defined by a\nRiemannian torus T and its dual T \u2217 are isomorphic, and we do indeed have a K-theory\nisomorphism K(T ) \u223c\n= K(T \u2217 ), but it is not compatible with the multiplication in K-theory.\nFurthermore, in some examples of TFTs coming from N = 2 supersymmetric sigma models\nthe category of boundary conditions does seem to be a tensor category.\nThe formula (4.5) for the boundary state shows that the lattice LB , which is picked\n\nout inside C by the dilaton field \u03b8, is not closed under multiplication in C unless \u03b8x = 1\nfor all points x; but the lattices corresponding to different dilaton fields multiply into each\n\nother just as happens with twisted K-classes. Nevertheless, in the semisimple case, if we\nP \u221a\ndefine an element S := x \u03b8x \u03b5x , then the operation\n(B1 , B2 ) 7\u2192 SB1 B2\n\ndoes define a multiplication on boundary states, though its significance is unclear.\n35\n\n(4.6)\n\n\f4.1. \"Cardy states\" vs. \"Ishibashi states\"\nThe formula (4.5) for the boundary state is reminiscent of what is what is known as a\n\"Cardy state\" in the construction of conformal field theories with boundary. That leaves\nthe question: what are the \"Ishibashi\" or \"character states\"? This question can be nicely\naddressed in the topological framework of this exposition. In the basis of primary fields in\nclosed (or chiral) conformal field theory the fusion rules are in general not diagonal. Thus\nthe usual basis \u03c6\u03bc , \u03bc = 1, . . . , N for C is different from the basis \u03b5i , i = 1, . . . , N used\nabove. The fusion rules are diagonal in the basis \u03b5i .\nThe analogy with CFT is the following. In boundary conformal field theory one\nassociates an \"Ishibashi\" or character state to every primary field of the chiral algebra.\nFormally these states are solutions to (T \u2212 T\u0304 )|Bi = 0, or the generalization of this to\nthe case of other chiral algebras. They are best thought of as intertwiners between left\nand right chiral representations. In the present context there is no chiral algebra, and we\nshould think of every element of C as a solution to (T \u2212 T\u0304 ) = 0, and its generalizations.\nThe basis of \"Ishibashi states\" associated to definite representations of the chiral\nalgebra is naturally associated to the basis \u03c6\u03bc analogous to primary fields. In this basis\nthe algebra is given by\n\u03c6\u03bc \u03c6\u03bd = N\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03c6\u03bb\n\n(4.7)\n\nwith positive integral N\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb . Using these formulae we recover, essentially, Cardy's formula\nfor Cardy boundary states in terms of character boundary states. Note that there is no\nneed to use any relation to the modular group.\nWe close with one further brief remark. It is nice to see the standard relation that\nthe closed string coupling is the square of the open string coupling in the present context.\nP\nIf we scale \u03b8C \u2192 \u03bb\u22122 \u03b8C then \u03c7C = \u03bc \u03c6\u03bc \u03c6\u03bc \u2192 \u03bb+2 \u03c7C . We may therefore interpret \u03bb2\n\nas the closed string couplling. On the other hand, the squareroot of \u03b8i in BO shows that\n\nBO \u2192 \u03bbBO , and therefore \u03bb is the open string coupling. Indeed, the partition function\nfor a surface with g handles and h holes is Z(\u03a3) = \u03b8C ((\u03c7C )g (BO )h ), and therefore scales\nas Z(\u03a3) \u2192 \u03bb\u2212\u03c7(\u03a3) Z(\u03a3), as expected, where \u03c7(\u03a3) = 2 \u2212 2g \u2212 h is the Euler number of \u03a3..\n36\n\n\f5. Landau-Ginzburg theories\nD-branes can be defined in general two-dimensional N=2 Landau-Ginzburg theories\n[31]. Such theories can be topologically twisted, producing topological Landau-Ginzburg\ntheories. It is interesting to compare with the D-branes obtained from our results applied\nto the resulting closed topological theory. Here we confine ourselves to a few very elementary remarks. In the past few years, following an initial suggestion by Kontsevich, an\nelaborate theory of categories of topological Landau-Ginzburg branes has been developed.\nWe refer to [32,33,34,35,36,37,38] for details. These categories are thought to capture more\nphysical information about the D-branes. In the case when all the critical points of the\nsuperpotential are Morse there is a functor to the category of branes we construct.\nLet us recall the definition of a topological LG theory. One begins with a superpotential W (Xi ) which is a holomorphic function of chiral superfields Xi . When W is a\npolynomial the Frobenius algebra is simply the Jacobian ideal\nC = C[Xi ]/(\u2202i W )\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe Frobenius structure is defined by a residue formula. For example, in the one-variable\ncase we define\n\u03b8(\u03c6) := ResX=\u221e\n\n\u03c6(X)\nW \u2032 (X)\n\n(5.2)\n\nIf the critical points of W are all Morse critical points then the algebra (5.1) is semisimple. Physically Morse critical points correspond to massive theories, while non-Morse\ncritical points renormalize to nontrivial 2d CFT's in the infrared.\nIf all the critical points are Morse then the trace is easily written in terms of the\ncritical points pa as\n\u03b8(\u03c6) = +\n\nX\n\ndW (pa )=0\n\n\u03c6(pa )\ndet(\u2202i \u2202j W |pa )\n\n(5.3)\n\nIn the semisimple one-variable case we can construct the basic idempotents as follows.\nLet\ndW =\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n(X \u2212 r\u03b1 )\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere we assume all the roots are distinct. Then it is easy to check that\n\u03b5\u03b2 :=\n\nY (X \u2212 r\u03b1 )\n(r\u03b2 \u2212 r\u03b1 )\n\n\u03b1:\u03b16=\u03b2\n\n37\n\n(5.5)\n\n\fare basic idempotents. (To prove this, write (X \u2212 r\u03b1 ) = (X \u2212 r\u03b2 ) + (r\u03b2 \u2212 r\u03b1 )).\nExample: W = 13 t3 \u2212 qt. For n = 2 we can explicitly write\n\u221a\n\nq+t\n\u221a\n2 q\n\u221a\nq\u2212t\n\u03b52 = \u221a\n2 q\n\n\u03b51 =\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNote that \u03b81 = 1/(2 q) and \u03b82 = \u22121/(2 q).\n\nThen from the general result above one finds O = End(W1 ) \u2295 End(W2 ) and\n1\n1\n\u03b8O (\u03a8) = \u221a Tr(\u03a81 ) + \u221a Tr(\u03a82 )\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\np\np\n\u03b9\u2217 (\u03a8) = \u03b81 Tr(\u03a81 )\u03b51 + \u03b82 Tr(\u03a82 )\u03b52\n\n(5.7)\n\nThus, the general boundary state is\n\u03b52\n\u03b51\nB = w1 \u221a + w2 \u221a\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere w1 , w2 are integers. Note the interesting monodromy as q \u2192 e2\u03c0i q. Branes of type\n(w1 , w2 ) map to branes of type (w2 , \u2212w1 ).\n\nClearly, there will be similar phenomena for general Landau-Ginzburg theories. The\n\nspace of superpotentials W has a codimension one \"discriminant locus\" where it has nonMorse critical points. Analytic continuation around this locus will permute the \u03b5i , but will\n\u221a\nonly permute the \u03b8i up to sign. One may understand in this elementary way some of the\nbrane permutation/creation phenomena discussed in numerous places in the literature.\nThe \"vector bundles on spacetime\" that we have found can be taken quite literally in\nthe context of the theory of strings moving in less than one dimension which was worked\nout in 1988-1991. (For a reviews [39][40][41]. ) Strings moving in a spacetime of n disjoint\npoints can be modelled by matrix chains or by topological field theory. The latter point\nof view is described in, for example, [40][41]. In the latter point of view, one considers\ntopological gravity coupled to topological matter. For n spacetime points the topological\nmatter can be taken to be the N = 2 Landau-Ginzburg theories associated to W given by\nthe unfolding of An singularities:\nxn+1\nW =\n+ a n xn + * * * + a 0\nn+1\n38\n\n(5.9)\n\n\fFor generic W we find vector bundles on n spacetime points. This is of course what we\nexpect for the branes in such spacetimes!\nIt is worth mentioning that in these simplest of string theories (the \"minimal string\ntheories\") considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding the full\nspectrum of D-branes, going beyond the topological field theory truncation. See [42] for a\nreview.\n\n6. Going beyond semisimple Frobenius algebras\nThe examples of topological field theories coming from N = 2 conformal field theories\n- Landau-Ginzburg models and the quantum cohomology rings of Calabi-Yau manifolds\n- suggest that it is of interest to understand the possible solutions of the algebraic conditions in the case when C is not semisimple. In this section we shall make some partial\n\nprogress with this problem, and shall also explain how it should perhaps be viewed in a\nwider context.\n6.1. Examples related to the cohomology of manifolds\n\nA natural example of a graded commutative Frobenius algebra is the cohomology with\ncomplex coefficients of a compact oriented manifold X. Thus, for C we can take the algebra\nR\nC = H \u2217 (X;C) with trace \u03b8(\u03c6) = X \u03c6. What are the corresponding O's?\n\nA natural guess, which turns out to be wrong, but for interesting reasons, is that we\n\nshould take O = C \u2297 MatN (C) = MatN (C) for some N > 0, together with\n\u03b8O (\u03c8) =\n\nZ\n\nTr(\u03c8)\n\n(6.1)\n\nX\n\nWhile O is indeed a Frobenius algebra, the only natural candidate for the map \u03b9\u2217 is \u03b9\u2217 (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c6 \u2297 1N . However, this fails to satisfy the Cardy condition: one computes \u03b9\u2217 (\u03c8) = Tr(\u03c8)\nfrom the adjoint relation, and hence \u03b9\u2217 \u03b9\u2217 (\u03c8) = Tr\u03c8 \u2297 1N . On the other hand, one also\nfinds\n\n\u03c0(\u03c8) =\n\nX\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)deg \u03c9i (deg \u03c8+deg \u03c9 ) \u03c9i \u2297 elm \u2227 \u03c8 \u2227 \u03c9 i \u2297 eml\n\n= \u03c7(T X) \u2227 Tr \u03c8\n\n(6.2)\n\nHere \u03c9i is a basis for H \u2217 (X;C), eml are matrix units, and \u03c7(T X) \u2208 H top (X;C) is the\n\nEuler class of T X. The map \u03c0 annihilates forms of positive degree, and cannot agree with\n\u03b9\u2217 \u03b9\u2217 .\n39\n\n\fThis example can be modified to give an open and closed theory by taking O to be\n\nassociated with a submanifold of X. This is, after all, the standard picture of D-branes!\n\nLet us work in the algebraic category of ZZ-graded vector spaces, and continue to take\nC = H \u2217 (X;C), with X a compact connected oriented n-dimensional manifold, and the\nR\ntrace \u03b8C (\u03c6) = X \u03c6 of degree \u2212n as above. Let us look for an open algebra of the form\n\nO = MatN (O0 ), with O0 commutative. Then O0 is a Frobenius algebra, and we may as\nwell assume that it is H \u2217 (Y ;C) for some compact oriented manifold14 Y of dimension m,\n\nand that \u03b9 : C \u2192 O0 is f \u2217 for some map f : Y \u2192 X.\n\nThus O = H \u2217 (Y ;C) \u2297 M atN (C) with open string trace\n\u03b8O (\u03a8) = \u03b8o\n\nZ\n\nTr(\u03a8)\n\n(6.3)\n\nY\n\nof degree \u2212m, where \u03b8o is a constant. This is a non-commutative Frobenius algebra.\nBy the adjoint relation \u03b9\u2217 is then determined to be\n\u03b9\u2217 (\u03a8) = \u03b8o f\u2217 (Tr(\u03a8))\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere f\u2217 is the adjoint of the ring homomorphism f \u2217 : H \u2217 (X) \u2192 H \u2217 (Y ) with respect to\n\nPoincar\u00e9 duality. Thus \u03b9\u2217 has degree n \u2212 m. On the other hand , one sees at once that\n\n\u03c0 : O \u2192 O has degree m, so if the Cardy condition is to hold we must have n = 2m. If\n\nthat is true, then we can assume, by making a small generic perturbation of f , that f is\nan immersion of Y in X. We can now make the the adjoint map f\u2217 more explicit:\nf\u2217 (\u03c8) = \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03c8) \u2227 \u03a6N ,\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere \u03c0 : N \u2192 Y is the projection of the normal bundle (identified with a tubular\n\nneighborhood of Y in X) and \u03a6N is the Thom class of the bundle, compactly supported\n\nin the tubular neighborhood, which represents the cohomology class of Y in X. One easily\nfinds that\n\u03b9\u2217 \u03b9\u2217 (\u03a8) = \u03b8o \u03c7(N Y ) \u2227 Tr(\u03a8) \u2297 1.\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere \u03c7(N Y ) is the Euler class of the normal bundle of Y \u0592\u2192 X, i.e. the homological\nself-intersection of Y in X.\n14\n\nIn fact we need to allow Y to have orbifold singularities to ensure this.\n\n40\n\n\fOn the other hand,\n\u03c0(\u03a8) =\n\n1\nTr(\u03a8)\u03c7(T Y )\n\u03b8o\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere \u03c7(T Y ) \u2208 H top (Y ;C) is the Euler class of the tangent bundle T Y , whose integral is\n\nthe Euler number of Y .\n\nEvidently the Cardy conditions are satisfied if we choose \u03b8o so that \u03c7(T Y ) = \u03b8o2 \u03c7(N Y ).\nThis is always possible if \u03c7(N Y ), which is the self-intersection number of Y in X, is nonzero, and also possible if Y is a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold X, for\nthen N \u223c\n= T Y . The boundary state is B = \u03b8o N \u03a6N .\n\nOne immediate consequence of this discussion is that if we start, say, with O =\n\nH \u2217 (CP 2 ) as our open algebra we can easily find two different closed algebras compatible\nwith it, by regarding Y as a submanifold either of X = CP 4 or of X \u2032 = IHP 2 .\n\nUnfortunately we do not know how to describe the category of boundary conditions\nfor C = H \u2217 (X). But it seems likely, in any case, that to get a significant result one would\n\nhave to consider the theory on the cochain level. We next turn our attention to that case.\n6.2. The Chas-Sullivan theory\nThere is an interesting example - due to Chas and Sullivan [43]- on the cochain\nlevel of a structure a little weaker than that of our open and closed theories which may\n\nilluminate the use of cochain theories. Let us start with a compact oriented manifold X,\nwhich we shall take to be connected and simply connected. We can define a category B\n\nwhose objects are the oriented submanifolds of X, and whose vector space of morphisms\nfrom Y to Z is OY Z = Ext\u2217H \u2217 (X) (H \u2217 (Y ); H \u2217 (Z)) - the cohomology, as usual, has complex\n\ncoefficients, and H \u2217 (Y ) and H \u2217 (Z) are regarded as H \u2217 (X)-modules by restriction. The\n\ncomposition of morphisms is given by the Yoneda composition of Ext groups. With this\ndefinition, however, it will not be true that OY Z is dual to OZY . (To see this it is enough\n\nto consider Ext0 = Hom, when, say, Y = X and Z is a point.)\n\nWe can do better by defining a cochain complex \u00d4Y Z of \"morphisms\" by\n\u00d4Y Z = B\u03a9(X) (\u03a9(Y ); \u03a9(Z)),\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhere \u03a9(X) denotes the usual de Rham complex of a manifold X, and BA (B; C), for a\n\ndifferential graded algebra A and differential graded modules B and C, is the usual cobar\n\nresolution\nHom(B; C) \u2192 Hom(A \u2297 B; C) \u2192 Hom(A \u2297 A \u2297 B; C) \u2192 . . . ,\n41\n\n(6.9)\n\n\f(in which the differential is given by\ndf (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ak \u2297 b) = a1 f (a2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ak \u2297 b)+\nX\n+\n(\u22121)i f (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ai ai+1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ak \u2297 b)+\n\n(6.10)\n\n+(\u22121)k f (a1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 ak\u22121 \u2297 ak b) )\n\nwhose cohomology is ExtA (B; C). This is different from OY Z = Ext\u2217H \u2217 (X) (H \u2217 (Y ); H \u2217 (Z)),\n\nbut related to it by a spectral sequence whose E2 -term is OY Z and which converges to\n\nH \u2217 (\u00d4Y Z ) = Ext\u03a9(X) (\u03a9(Y ); \u03a9(Z)). But more important is that H \u2217 (\u00d4Y Z ) is the homology\n\u223c\nof the space PY Z of paths in X which begin in Y and end in Z. To be precise, H p (\u00d4Y Z ) =\nHp+dZ (PY Z ), where dZ is the dimension of Z. On the cochain complexes the Yoneda\n\ncomposition is associative up to cochain homotopy, and defines a structure of an A\u221e -\n\ncategory B\u0302. The corresponding composition of homology groups\n\nHi (PY Z ) \u00d7 Hj (PZW ) \u2192 Hi+j\u2212dZ (PY W )\n\n(6.11)\n\nis the composition of the Gysin map associated to the inclusion of the codimension dZ\nsubmanifold M of pairs of composable paths in the product PY Z \u00d7 PZW with the con-\n\ncatenation map M \u2192 PY W .\n\nLet us try to fit a \"closed string\" cochain algebra C to this A\u221e category. The algebra\n\nof endomorphisms of the identity functor of B, denoted E in \u00a73, is easily seen to be just the\n\ncohomology algebra H \u2217 (X). We have mentioned in Section 2 that this is the Hochschild\ncohomology HH 0 (B).\nThe definition of Hochschild cohomology for a linear category B was given at the end\n\nof \u00a73. In fact the definition of the Hochschild complex makes sense for an A\u221e category\n\nsuch as B\u0302, and it is one candidate for the closed algebra C.\n\nIn the present situation C is equivalent to the usual Hochschild complex of the dif-\n\nferential graded algebra \u03a9(X), whose cohomology is the homology of the free loop space\n\nLX with its degrees shifted downwards15 by the dimension dX of X, so that the coho-\n\nmology H i (C) is potentially non-zero for \u2212dX \u2264 i < \u221e. This algebra was introduced by\n\nChas and Sullivan in precisely the present context - they were trying to reproduce the\nstructures of string theory in the setting of classical algebraic topology. There is a map\nH i (X) \u2192 H \u2212i (C) which embeds the ordinary cohomology ring of X in the Chas-Sullivan\n15\n\nThus the identity element of the algebra, in H 0 (C), is the fundamental class of X, regarded\n\nas an element of Hn (LX) by thinking of the points of X as point loops in LX.\n\n42\n\n\fring, and there is also a ring homorphism H i (C) \u2192 Hi (L0 X) to the Pontrjagin ring of the\n\nbased loop space L0 X, based at any chosen point in X.\n\nThe other candidate for C mentioned in Section 2 was the cyclic cohomology of the\n\nalgebra \u03a9(X), which is well-known [44] to be the equivariant homology of the free loop\nspace LX with respect to its natural circle-action. This may be an improvement on the\nnon-equivariant homology.\n\nThe structure we have arrived at is, however, not a cochain-level open and closed\ntheory, as we have no trace maps inducing inner products on H \u2217 (\u00d4Y Z ). When one tries to\ndefine operators corresponding to cobordisms it turns out to be possible only when each\n\nconnected component of the cobordism has non-empty outgoing boundary. (A theory defined on this smaller category is often called a non-compact theory.) The nearest theory in\nour sense to the Chas-Sullivan one is the so-called \"A-model\" defined for a symplectic manifold X. There the A\u221e category is the Fukaya category, whose objects are the Lagrangian\n\nsubmanifolds of X equipped with bundles with connection, and the cochain complex of\nmorphisms from Y to Z is the Floer complex which calculates the \"semi-infinite\" cohomology of the path space PY Z . In good cases the cohomology of this Floer complex has\na vector space basis indexed by the points of intersection of Y and Z, and the cohomol-\n\nogy of the corresponding closed complex is just the ordinary cohomology of X. From our\nperspective the essential feature of the Floer theory is that it satisfies Poincar\u00e9 duality for\nthe infinite dimensional manifold LX.\n6.3. Remarks on the B-model\nLet X be a complex variety of complex dimension d with a trivialization of its canonical\nbundle. That is, we assume there is a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic d-form \u03a9. The Bmodel [45] is a ZZ-graded topological field theory arising from the N=2 supersymmetric \u03c3model of X. The natural boundary conditions for the theory are provided by holomorphic\nvector bundles on X.\nThe category of holomorphic vector bundles is not a Frobenius category. There is,\nhowever, a very natural ZZ-graded Frobenius category associated to X: the category VX\n\nwhose objects are the vector bundles on X, but whose space of morphisms from E to F is\nOEF = Ext\u2217X (E; F ) = H 0,\u2217 (X; E \u2217 \u2297 F ).\nThe trace \u03b8E : OEE \u2192 C, of degree \u2212d, is defined by\nZ\n\u03b8E (\u03a8) =\nTr(\u03a8) \u2227 \u03a9.\nX\n\n43\n\n(6.12)\n\n(6.13)\n\n\fThis is nondegenerate by Serre duality, but the category is still not semisimple - in fact\nthe non-vanishing of groups Exti for i > 0 precisely expresses the non-semisimplicity of\nthe category. (For a non-zero element of Ext1X (E; F ) corresponds to an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 F \u2192 G \u2192 E \u2192 0 which does not split, i.e. to a vector bundle G with a subbundle F\nwith no complementary bundle.)\n\nWhat are the endomorphisms of the identity functor of VX ? Multiplication by any\n\nelement of H 0,\u2217 (X) clearly defines such an endomorphism. A holomorphic vector field\n\n\u03be on X also defines an endomorphism of degree 1, for any bundle E has an \"Atiyah\n\u2217\nclass\"16 aE \u2208 Ext1 (E; E \u2297 TX\n) - its curvature - which we can contract with \u03be to give\n\ne\u03be = \u03b9\u03be aE \u2208 Ext1 (E; E). More generally, a class\n\u03b7\u2208H\n\n0,q\n\n(X;\n\np\n^\n\nq\n\nTX ) = Ext (\n\np\n^\n\n\u2217\nTX\n;C)\n\n\u2217 \u2297p\ncan be contracted with (aE )p \u2208 Extp (E; E \u2297 (TX\n) ) to give\n\ne\u03b7 = \u03b9\u03b7 (aE )p \u2208 Extp+q (E; E).\nV\u2217\nNow Witten has shown in [45] that H 0,\u2217 (X;\nTX ) is indeed the closed string algebra of the\n\nB-model. To understand this in our context we must once again pass to the cochain-level\ntheory of which the Ext groups are the cohomology. A good way to do this is to replace\n\na holomorphic vector bundle E by its \u2202-complex \u00ca = \u03a90,\u2217 (X; E), which is a differential\ngraded module for the differential graded algebra A = \u03a90,\u2217 (X). Then we define \u00d4EF\n\nas the cochain complex HomA (\u00ca; F\u0302 ), whose cohomology groups are Ext\u2217X (E; F ). If we\nare going to do this, it is natural to allow a larger class of objects, namely all finitely\ngenerated projective differential graded A-modules. Any coherent sheaf E on X defines\nsuch a module: one first resolves E by a complex E \u2217 of vector bundles, and then takes the\ntotal complex of the double complex \u00ca \u2217 . The resulting enlarged category is essentially the\nbounded derived category of the category of coherent sheaves on X. In this setting, we find\nwithout difficulty that the endomorphisms of the identity morphism are given, just as in\nthe topological example above, by the Hochschild complex\nC\u02c6 = {A \u2192 A \u2297 A \u2192 A \u2297 A \u2297 A \u2192 . . . },\nV\u2217\nwhose cohomology is H \u2217 (X;\nTX ). There is still, however, work to do to understand\n\u02c6 and the adjoint maps \u03b9E and \u03b9E . We feel that this has not yet been\nthe trace maps on C,\nproperly elucidated in the literature. For some progress on this question see [46][47].\n16\n\n\u2217\n\u2192 J 1 E \u2192 E, where J 1 E is the bundle of\nCorresponding to the extension of bundles E \u2297 TX\n1-jets of holomorphic sections of E.\n\n44\n\n\f7. Equivariant 2-dimensional topological open and closed theory\nAn important construction in string theory is the \"orbifold\" construction. Abstractly,\nthis can be carried out whenever the closed string background has a group G of automorphisms. There are two steps in defining an orbifold theory. First, one must extend the\ntheory by introducing \"external\" gauge fields, which are G-bundles (with connection) on\nthe world-sheets. Next, one must construct a new theory by summing over all possible\nG-bundles (and connections).\nWe begin by describing carefully the first step in forming the orbifold theory. The\nsecond step - summing over the G-bundles - is then very easy in the case of a finite\ngroup G.\n7.1. Equivariant closed theories\nLet us begin with some general remarks. In d-dimensional topological field theory\none begins with a category S whose objects are oriented (d \u2212 1)-manifolds and whose\n\nmorphisms are oriented cobordisms. Physicists say that a theory admits a group G as a\nglobal symmetry group if G acts on the vector space associated to each (d\u22121)-manifold, and\nthe linear operator associated to each cobordism is a G-equivariant map. When we have\nsuch a \"global\" symmetry group G we can ask whether the symmetry can be \"gauged\", i.e.\nwhether elements of G can be applied \"independently\" - in some sense - at each point\nof space-time. Mathematically the process of \"gauging\" has a very elegant description:\nit amounts to extending the field theory functor from the category S to the category\n\nSG whose objects are (d \u2212 1)-manifolds equipped with a principal G bundle, and whose\n\nmorphisms are cobordisms with a G-bundle.17 We regard S as a subcategory of SG by\n\nequipping each (d \u2212 1)-manifold S with the trivial G-bundle S \u00d7 G. In SG the group of\n\nautomorphisms of the trivial bundle S \u00d7 G contains G, and so in a gauged theory G acts\n\non the state space H(S): this should be the original \"global\" action of G. But the gauged\n\ntheory has a state space H(S, P ) for each G-bundle P on S: if P is non-trivial one calls\nH(S, P ) a \"twisted sector\" of the theory. In the case d = 2, when S = S 1 we have the\n\nbundle Pg \u2192 S 1 obtained by attaching the ends of [0, 2\u03c0] \u00d7 G via multiplication by g.\n\nAny bundle is isomorphic to one of these, and Pg is isomorphic to Pg \u2032 if and only if g \u2032\n\nis conjugate to g. But note that the state space depends on the bundle and not just its\n17\n\nWe are assuming here that the group G is discrete: if G is a Lie group we should define SG\n\nas the category of manifolds equipped with a principal G-bundle with a connection.\n\n45\n\n\fisomorphism class, so we have a twisted sector state space Cg = H(S, Pg ) labelled by a\ngroup element g rather than by a conjugacy class.\n\nWe shall call a theory defined on the category SG a G-equivariant TFT. It is important\n\nto distinguish the equivariant theory from the corresponding \"gauged theory,\" described\n\nbelow. In physics, the equivariant theory is obtained by coupling to nondynamical background gauge fields, while the gauged theory is obtained by \"summing\" over those gauge\nfields in the path integral.\nAn alternative and equivalent viewpoint which is especially useful in the twodimensional case is that SG is the category whose objects are oriented (d \u2212 1)-manifolds\n\nS equipped with a map p : S \u2192 BG, where BG is the classifying space of G. In this view-\n\npoint we have a bundle over the space Map(S, BG) whose fiber at p is Hp . To say that Hp\n\ndepends only on the G-bundle p\u2217 BG on S pulled back from the universal G-bundle EG\non BG by p is the same as to say that the bundle on Map(S, BG) is equipped with a flat\nconnection allowing us to identify the fibres at points in the same connected component by\nparallel transport; for the set of bundle isomorphisms p\u22170 EG \u2192 p\u22171 EG is the same as the\nset of homotopy classes of paths from p0 to p1 . When S = S 1 the connected components\nof the space of maps correspond to the conjugacy classes in G: each bundle Pg corresponds\nto a specific point pg in the mapping space, and a group-element h defines a specific path\nfrom pg to phgh\u22121 .\nThe second viewpoint makes clear that G-equivariant topological field theories are\nexamples of \"homotopy topological field theories\" in the sense of Turaev [48]. We shall\nuse his two main results: first, an attractive generalization of the theorem that a twodimensional TFT \"is\" a commutative Frobenius algebra, and, secondly, a classification of\nthe ways of gauging a given global G-symmetry of a semisimple TFT. We shall now briefly\nreview his work .\nA G-equivariant TFT gives us for each element g \u2208 G a vector space Cg , associated\n\nto the circle equipped with the bundle Pg whose holonomy is g. The usual pair-of-pants\n\ncobordism, equipped with the evident G-bundle which restricts to Pg1 and Pg2 on the two\nincoming circles, and to Pg1 g2 on the outgoing circle, induces a product\nCg1 \u2297 Cg2 \u2192 Cg1 g2\nmaking C := \u2295g\u2208G Cg into a G-graded algebra.\n46\n\n(7.1)\n\n\fFig. 15: Definition of the product in the G-equivariant closed theory. The heavy\ndot is the basepoint on S 1 . To specify the morphism unambiguously we must\nindicate consistent holonomies along a set of curves whose complement consists of\nsimply connected pieces. This means that the product is not commutative. We\nneed to fix a convention for holonomies of a composition of curves, i.e. whether we\nare using left or right path-ordering. We will take h(\u03b31 \u25e6 \u03b32 ) = h(\u03b31 ) * h(\u03b32 ).\n\nFig. 16: (a) The action of \u03b1h on a state \u03c6 \u2208 Cg . This can also be represented by\nthe cylinder as in (b).\n\nAs in the usual case there is a trace \u03b8 : C1 \u2192 C defined by the disk diagram with\n\none ingoing circle. Note that the holonomy around the boundary of the disk must be 1.\nMaking the standard assumption that the cylinder corresponds to the unit operator we\nobtain a nondegenerate pairing Cg \u2297 Cg \u22121 \u2192 C.\nA new element in the equivariant theory is that G acts as an automorphism group on\nC. That is, there is a a homomorphism \u03b1 : G \u2192 Aut(C) such that\n\u03b1h : Cg \u2192 Chgh\u22121 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nDiagramatically, \u03b1h is defined by the surface in fig. 16.\nNow let us note some properties of \u03b1. First, if \u03c6 \u2208 Ch then \u03b1h (\u03c6) = \u03c6. The reason\n\nfor this is explained in fig. 17.\n\n47\n\n\fFig. 17: If the holonomy along path P2 is h then the holonomy along path P1\nis 1. However, a Dehn twist around the inner circle maps P1 into P2 . Therefore,\n\u03b1h (\u03c6) = \u03b11 (\u03c6) = \u03c6, if \u03c6 \u2208 Ch .\n\nFig. 18: Demonstrating twisted centrality.\n\nFig. 19: Deforming the LHS of (a) into a spacetime evolution diagram yields (b),\nwhose value is TrCh (L\u03c8 \u03b1g ). Similarly deforming the RHS of (a) gives a diagram\nwhose value is TrCg\u22121 (R\u03c8 \u03b1h ).\n\nNext, while C is not commutative, it is \"twisted-commutative\" in the following sense.\nIf \u03c61 \u2208 Cg1 and \u03c62 \u2208 Cg2 then\n\u03b1g2 (\u03c61 )\u03c62 = \u03c62 \u03c61 .\n48\n\n(7.3)\n\n\fThe necessity of this condition is illustrated in fig. 18.\nThe last property we need is a little more complicated. The trace of the identity map\nof Cg is the partition function of the theory on a torus with the bundle with holonomy\n\n(g, 1). Cutting the torus the other way, we see that this is the trace of \u03b1g on C1 . Similarly,\n\nby considering the torus with a bundle with holonomy (g, h), where g and h are two\ncommuting elements of G, we see that the trace of \u03b1g on Ch is the trace of \u03b1h on Cg \u22121 .\n\nBut we need a strengthening of this property. Even when g and h do not commute we can\nform a bundle with holonomy (g, h) on a torus with one hole, around which the holonomy\nwill be c = hgh\u22121 g \u22121 . We can cut this torus along either of its generating circles to get\na cobordism operator from Cc \u2297 Ch to Ch or from Cg \u22121 \u2297 Cc to Cg \u22121 . If \u03c8 \u2208 Chgh\u22121 g \u22121 let\n\nus introduce two linear transformations L\u03c8 , R\u03c8 associated to left- and right-multiplication\n\nby \u03c8. On the one hand, L\u03c8 \u03b1g : \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c8\u03b1g (\u03c6) is a map Ch \u2192 Ch . On the other hand\n\nR\u03c8 \u03b1h : \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03b1h (\u03c6)\u03c8 is a map Cg \u22121 \u2192 Cg \u22121 . The last sewing condition states that these\n\ntwo endomorphisms must have equal traces:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nTrCh L\u03c8 \u03b1g = TrCg\u22121 R\u03c8 \u03b1h .\n\n(7.4)\n\nThe reason for this can be deduced by pondering the diagram in fig. 19.\n\nFig. 20: A simpler axiom than Turaev's torus axiom.\n\nThe equation ((7.4)) was taken by Turaev as one of his axioms. It can, however,\nbe reexpressed in a way that we shall find more convenient. Let \u2206g \u2208 Cg \u2297 Cg \u22121 be\n\nthe \"duality\" element corresponding to the identity cobordism of (S 1 , Pg ) with both ends\nP\nregarded as outgoing. We have \u2206g =\n\u03bei \u2297 \u03be i , where \u03bei and \u03be i run through dual bases of\nCg and Cg \u22121 . Let us also write\n\n\u2206h =\n\nX\n\n\u03b7i \u2297 \u03b7 i \u2208 Ch \u2297 Ch\u22121 .\n49\n\n\fThen ((7.4)) is easily seen to be equivalent to\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03b1h (\u03bei )\u03be i =\n\n\u03b7i \u03b1g (\u03b7 i ),\n\n(7.5)\n\nin which both sides are elements of Chgh\u22121 g \u22121 . This equation is illustrated by the isomorphic\n\ncobordisms of fig. 20.\n\nIn summary, the sewing theorem for G-equivariant 2d topological field theories is given\nby the following theorem:\nTheorem 4 ([48]) To give a 2d G-equivariant topological field theory is to give a G-graded\nalgebra C = \u2295g Cg together with a group homomorphism \u03b1 : G \u2192 Aut(C) such that\n\n1. There is a G-invariant trace \u03b8 : C1 \u2192 C which induces a nondegenerate pairing Cg \u2297\nCg \u22121 \u2192 C.\n\n2. The restriction of \u03b1h to Ch is the identity.\n3. For all \u03c6 \u2208 Cg , \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 Ch , \u03b1h (\u03c6)\u03c6\u2032 = \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6.\n4. For all g, h \u2208 G we have\nX\nwhere \u2206g =\n\nP\n\n\u03b1h (\u03bei )\u03be i =\n\nX\n\n\u03b7i \u03b1g (\u03b7 i ) \u2208 Chgh\u22121 g \u22121 ,\n\n\u03bei \u2297 \u03be i \u2208 Cg \u2297 Cg \u22121 and \u2206h =\n\nP\n\n(7.6)\n\n\u03b7i \u2297 \u03b7 i \u2208 Ch \u2297 Ch\u22121 as above.\n\nRemarks:\n1. We will give a proof of the sewing theorem in the appendix.\n2. Warning: Turaev calls the above a crossed G Frobenius algebra, but it is not a crossedproduct algebra in the sense of C \u2217 algebras (see below). We will refer to an algebra\nsatisfying the conditions of the theorem as a Turaev algebra.\n3. Axioms 1 and 3 have counterparts in the non-equivariant theory, but axioms 2 and 4\nare new elements.\n7.2. The orbifold theory\nBefore going any further, let us describe how we obtain the orbifold theory from the\nTuraev algebra.\nLet us return to the general discussion at the beginning of \u00a77.1, where we outlined the\n\ndefinition of an equivariant theory. Roughly speaking, the gauged theory is obtained from\nthe equivariant theory by summing over the gauge fields. More precisely, the state-space\nwhich a gauged theory associates to a (d \u2212 1)-manifold S consists of \"wave-functions\" \u03c8\n50\n\n\fwhich associate to each G-bundle P on S an element \u03c8P of the state-space HS,P of the\nequivariant theory. The map \u03c8 must be \"natural\" in the sense that when \u03b8 : P \u2192 P \u2032 is\n\na bundle isomorphism the induced isomorphism HS,P \u2192 HS,P \u2032 takes \u03c8P to \u03c8P \u2032 . This is\noften referred to as the \"Gauss law.\" In the two-dimensional case, the Gauss law amounts\n\nto saying that the state-space Corb for the circle is the G-invariant part of the Turaev\nalgebra C = \u2295Cg . In other words,\n\nCorb = \u2295{Cg }Zg ,\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere now g runs through a set of representatives for the conjugacy classes in G, and we\ntake the invariant part of Cg under the centralizer Zg of g in G. The algebra Corb is not a\n\ngraded algebra if G is non-abelian. One must check that the product in Corb is simply the\nrestriction of the product in C. The trace Corb \u2192 C is the restriction of the trace C \u2192 C\n\nwhich is the given trace on C1 and is zero on Cg when g 6= 1. Then Corb is a commutative\n\nFrobenius algebra which encodes the orbifold theory.\n\n7.3. Solutions of the closed string G-equivariant sewing conditions\nHaving found the sewing conditions in the G-equivariant case we can ask what examples there are of the structure. The Frobenius algebra C1 with its G-action corresponds\n\nto a topological field theory with a global G-symmetry. In the case when C1 is a semisim-\n\nple Frobenius algebra - and therefore the algebra of functions on a finite G-set X -\n\nTuraev finds a nice answer: ways of gauging the symmetry, i.e. of extending C1 to a Tu-\n\nraev algebra, correspond to equivariant B-fields on X, i.e. to equivariant 2-cocycles of X\n\nwith values in C\u00d7 , and two such B-fields define isomorphic Turaev algebras if and only if\nthey represent the same class in H 2 (X;C\u00d7 ) \u223c\n= H 3 (X; ZZ). We now review this result and\nG\n\nG\n\ntake the opportunity to introduce a more geometric picture of Turaev's algebra C (in the\nsemisimple case). We shall first recall some very general constructions.\n7.3.1.General constructions\nWhenever a group G acts on a set X we can form a category X//G, whose objects\nare the points x of X, and whose morphisms x0 \u2192 x1 are\nHom(x0 , x1 ) := {g \u2208 G : gx0 = x1 }.\n51\n\n(7.8)\n\n\fFig. 21: An oriented two-simplex \u2206x,g1 ,g2 in the space |X//G|.\n\nFig. 22: An oriented 3-simplex in |X//G|.\n\nNext, for any category C, one can form the space of the category, denoted |C|. This\n\nis an oriented simplicial complex whose p-simplexes are in 1-1 correspondence with the\ncomposable p-tuples of morphisms in the category. To be specific, the vertices are the\nobjects of the category. The edges are the morphisms. Triples of morphisms (f1 , f2 , f3 )\n\nwith f3 = f2 \u25e6 f1 correspond to 2-simplices, and so forth. In the present case, when we\n\nform the simplicial complex |X//G| the 2-simplices are the triples (g1 , g2 , x) illustrated in\nfig. 21. Three-simplices are shown in fig. 22, etc.\n\nThe space |X//G| is a model for (X \u00d7 EG)/G. Hence the (cellular) cohomology of\n\n\u2217\n(X;C\u00d7 ).\nthis space H \u2217 (|X//G|;C\u00d7 ) is the equivariant cohomology HG\n\nAnother object which we can associate to any category C is its algebra A(C) over the\n52\n\n\ffield C. This has a vector space basis {\u03b5f } indexed by the morphisms of C, and the product\n\nis given by \u03b5f1 \u03b5f2 = \u03b5f1 \u25e6f2 when f1 and f2 are composable, and \u03b5f1 \u03b5f2 = 0 otherwise. For\n\nthe category X//G the algebra A(X//G) is the usual crossed-product algebra A(X) \u00d7 G in\nthe sense of operator algebra theory, where A(X) is the algebra of complex-valued functions\n\non the set X.\n\n18\n\nThe construction of the category-algebra A(C) can be generalized. A B-field on a\ncategory C is a rule which associates a complex line Lf to each morphism f of C, and\nassociative isomorphisms\nLf1 \u2297 Lf2 \u2192 Lf1 \u25e6f2\nto each pair (f1 , f2 ) of composable morphisms . In concrete terms, to give such a product\nis to give a 2-cocycle on the space |C|. Indeed, choosing basis elements lf \u2208 Lf , we must\nhave\n\nlf1 * lf2 = b(f1 , f2 , f3 )lf3\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere b(f1 , f2 , f3 ) \u2208 C\u00d7 defines a 2-cochain on |C|. (We choose values in C\u00d7 rather than\n\nC so the product is not degenerate.) Associativity of (7.10) holds iff b is a 2-cocycle. A\n\nchange of basis of the Lf modifies b by a coboundary. Hence the isomorphism classes of\nB-fields on C are in 1-1 correspondence with cohomology classes [b] \u2208 H 2 (|C|;C\u00d7 ). When\n\nwe have a B-field b on C we can form a twisted category-algebra Ab (C), which as a vector\nspace is \u2295Lf , and where the multiplication is defined by means of the associative maps\n\nLf1 \u2297 Lf2 \u2192 Lf1 \u25e6f2 .\n\nApplying the above construction to the category X//G, an associative product on the\n\n2\nlines Lg,x is the same thing as a 2-cocycle in HG\n(X;C\u00d7 ). In terms of the basis elements\n\nlg,x for the lines Lg,x we shall write the multiplication\nlg2 ,x2 lg1 ,x1 = bx1 (g2 , g1 )lg2 g1 ,x1\n=0\n18\n\nif\n\nx2 = g 1 x1\notherwise\n\n(7.11)\n\nFor any commutative algebra A with G-action, A \u00d7 G is spanned by elements a \u2297 g with\n\na \u2208 A and g \u2208 G, and the product is given by\n(a1 \u2297 g1 )(a2 \u2297 g2 ) = a1 g1 (a2 ) \u2297 g1 g2 .\n\n(7.9)\n\nThe isomorphism A(X//G) \u2192 A(X) \u00d7 G takes \u03b5g,x to \u03c7gx \u2297 g, where \u03c7x is the characteristic\nfunction supported at x.\n\n53\n\n\fHere bx1 (g2 , g1 ) = b(\u2206x,g1 ,g2 ) is the value of the cocycle on the oriented 2-simplex of fig. 21.\nNotice that if Gx is the isotropy group of some point x \u2208 X then restricting (7.11) to\n\nthe elements lg,x with g \u2208 Gx shows that bx defines an element of the group cohomology\n\nH 2 (Gx ;C\u00d7 ), corresponding to the central extension of Gx by C\u00d7 whose elements are pairs\n(g, \u03bb) with g \u2208 Gx and \u03bb \u2208 Lx \u2212 {0}. This central extension of the isotropy group Gx\n\ndoes not in general extend to any central extension of the whole group G. It does so,\nhowever, in the particular case when the B-field b is pulled back from a 2-cocycle of G\nby the map X \u2192 (point), i.e. when bx (g2 , g1 ) is independent of x. In general the cocycle\n\nb : G \u00d7 G \u00d7 X \u2192 C\u00d7 can be regarded as a cocycle of the group G with values in the abelian\n\ngroup A(X)\u00d7 = Map(X;C\u00d7 ) with its natural G-action. Thus it defines a (non-central)\nextension\n1 \u2192 A(X)\u00d7 \u2192 G\u0303 \u2192 G \u2192 1.\n\nOne technical point to notice is that for any B-field we have Lf = C canonically when\nf is an identity morphism. Thus Lg,x = C when g = 1. We shall always choose lg,x = 1\nwhen g = 1, thereby normalizing the cocycle so that bx (g1 , g2 ) = 1 if either g1 or g2 is 1.\nThe algebra Ab (X//G) = \u2295g\u2208G,x\u2208X Lg,x with the multiplication rule defined by (7.11)\n\ncan be identified with the twisted crossed-product algebra A(X) \u00d7b G via\nlg,x 7\u2192 \u03c7gx \u2297 g,\n\nwhere \u03c7x is the characteristic function supported at x. The twisted cross-product is defined\nby\n(f1 \u2297 g1 )(f2 \u2297 g2 ) = \u03b1g1 g2 (b(g1 , g2 ))f1 \u03b1g1 (f2 ) \u2297 g1 g2 ,\n\n(7.12)\n\nwhere b(g1 , g2 ) denotes the function x 7\u2192 bx (g1 , g2 ) in A(X)\u00d7 , and the group G acts on\n\nA(X) in the natural way\n\n\u03b1g (f )(x) = f (g \u22121 x),\nso that g * \u03c7x = \u03c7gx .\n\nIf we wish to apply these considerations to the spin case described in sections 2.6 and\n\n3.4 then we must consider the lines Lf to be ZZ/2 graded. In this case the theory will\nadmit a further twisting by H 1 (|C|; ZZ/2). However, we will not discuss this generalization\nfurther.\n54\n\n\fFig. 23: The algebra of little loops for X = S3 /S2 , where Sn is the permutation\ngroup on n letters.\n\n7.3.2.The Turaev algebra associated to a G-space\nThe algebra Ab (X//G) does not satisfy the sewing conditions and is not a Turaev\nalgebra. In particular (7.3) is usually not satisfied for a crossed-product algebra. However,\nthe subcategory defined by the morphisms with the same initial and terminal object does\nlead to a Turaev algebra for any B-field b on X//G. We call this the \"algebra of little\nloops\". Thus we define C = \u2295g Cg \u2282 Ab (X//G) by\nCg := \u2295x:gx=x Lg,x\n\n(7.13)\n\n\u03b8(lg,x) = \u03b4g,1 \u03b8(\u03b5x )\n\n(7.14)\n\nand define the trace by\n\nwhere on the right \u03b8 is the given G-invariant trace on C1 , and the \u03b5x are the usual idempo-\n\ntents in the semisimple Frobenius algebra C1 = A(X), i.e. \u03b5x = 1 \u2208 L1,x = C. The algebra\n\nof little loops can be visualized as in fig. 23.\n\nAn equivalent way to describe C is as the commutant of C1 = A(X) in Ab (X//G) =\n\nA(X) \u00d7b G. As A(X) is in the centre of C, it is natural to think of C as the sections of a\n\nbundle of algebras on X; the fibre of this bundle at x \u2208 X is the twisted group algebra\n\nCbx [Gx ], where Gx is the isotropy group of x. Furthermore, the bundle of algebras has\na natural G-action, covering the G-action on X. To see this, notice that the extension\nG\u0303 = {f, g) : f \u2208 A(X)\u00d7 , g \u2208 G} of the group G by the multiplicative group A(X)\u00d7 defined\n\nby the B-field sits inside the multiplicative group of A(X)\u00d7b G, normalizing the subalgebra\nA(X). As A(X) is in the centre of C, this means that G acts by conjugation on the algebra\n\nC. Notice, however, that only G\u0303 and not G acts on the larger algebra Ab (X//G).\n55\n\n\fIn terms of explicit formulae, the action of G on the algebra C is given by\n\u03b1g1 (lg2 ,x ) = lg1 ,x lg2 ,x l\u22121\ng1 ,x = zx (g2 , g1 )lg1 g2 g \u22121 ,g1 x ,\n1\n\n(7.15)\n\nwhere\nzx (g2 , g1 ) =\n\nbx (g1 , g2 )bx (g1 g2 , g1\u22121 )\n.\nbx (g1 , g1\u22121 )\n\n(7.16)\n\nIn this way we obtain a Turaev algebra, which we shall denote by C = T (X, b, \u03b8). The\n\nonly non-trivial point is to verify the \"torus\" axiom (7.4) . But in fact it is easy to see\nthat both sides of the equation are equal to\nX\n\n\u22121\nlh,x lg,xl\u22121\nh,x lg,x ,\n\nx\n\nwhere x runs through the set {x \u2208 X : hx = gx = x}.\nTuraev has shown that the above construction is the most general one possible in the\nsemisimple case.\nTheorem 5 ([48], Theorem 3.6)\n\nLet C be a Turaev algebra. If C1 is semisimple then\n\nC is the twisted algebra T (X, b, \u03b8) of little loops on X = Spec(C1 ) for some cocycle b \u2208\n2\nZG\n(X;C\u00d7 ).\n\nProof: If C1 is semisimple we may decompose it in terms of the basic idempotents \u03b5x . Then\n\nCg is a module over C1 , and hence it should be identified with the cross sections of the\n\nvector bundle over the finite set X whose fibre at x is Cg,x = \u03b5x Cg . (This is a trivial case\n\nof what is called the Serre-Swan theorem.) Now we consider the torus axiom (7.4) in the\nP\ncase h = 1. We have \u22061 = \u03b8(\u03b5x )\u22121 \u03b5x \u2297 \u03b5x , and hence\nX\n\n\u03b8(\u03b5x )\u22121 \u03b1g (\u03b5x )\u03b5x =\n\nX\n\n\u03b8(\u03b5x )\u22121 \u03b5x ,\n\nwhere the second sum is over x such that gx = x. On the other hand we readily calculate\nthat if {ax,i } is a basis of Cg,x and {a\u2217x,i } is the dual basis of Cg \u22121 ,x then ag,ia\u2217g,i = \u03b8(\u03b5x )\u22121 \u03b5x ,\n\nso that the other side of the torus axiom is\nX\n\ndim(Cg,x )\u03b5x .\n56\n\n\fThus the axiom tells us that Cg,x is a one-dimensional space Lg,x when gx = x, and is\n\nzero otherwise. The multiplication in C makes these lines into a G-equivariant B-field on\n\nthe category of small loops in X//G. Finally, it is not hard to show that the category of\nB-fields on X//G is equivalent to the category of G-equivariant B-fields on the category\nof small loops; but we shall omit the details. \u2660.\nLet us now consider the orbifold theory coming from the gauged theory defined by the\nTuraev algebra C = T (X, b, \u03b8). We saw in Section 7.2 that it is defined by the commutative\nFrobenius algebra Corb which is the G-invariant subalgebra of C. In the case of the Turaev\nalgebra of a G-space X we have\n\nTheorem 6 The orbifold algebra Corb is the centre of the crossed-product algebra A(X)\u00d7b\n\nG. It is the algebra of functions on a finite set (X/G)string which is a \"thickening\" of the\n\norbit space X/G with one point for each pair \u03be, \u03c1 consisting of an orbit \u03be and an irreducible\nprojective representation \u03c1 of the isotropy group Gx of a point x \u2208 \u03be, with the projective\ncocycle bx defined by the B-field.\n\nProof The Turaev algebra C consists of the elements of A(X) \u00d7b G which commute with\n\nA(X). But an element of A(X) \u00d7b G belongs to its centre if an only if it commutes with\n\nA(X) and also commutes with the elements of G, i.e. is G-invariant.\n\nNow we saw that C is the product over the points x \u2208 X of the twisted group-algebras\n\nCbx [Gx ]. The invariant part is therefore the product over the orbits \u03be of the Gx -invariant\npart of Cbx [Gx ], i.e. of the centre of Cbx [Gx ], which consists of one copy of C for each\nirreducible representation \u03c1 with the cocycle bx . \u2660\nThe Turaev algebra C = T (X, b, \u03b8) sits between Corb and A(X) \u00d7b G. We shall see in\n\nSection 7.6 that A(X) \u00d7b G is semisimple, and hence Morita equivalent19 to its centre Corb .\n\nBut the Turaev algebra retains more information than the orbifold theory: it encodes X\n\nand its G-action. The difference is plainest when G - of order n - acts freely on X; then\nA(X) \u00d7 G is the product of a copy of the algebra of n \u00d7 n matrices for each G-orbit in X,\n\nand provides us with no way of distinguishing the individual points of X. We shall see in\n19\n\nThis means that the category of representations of A(X) \u00d7b G is equivalent to the category\n\nof representations of Corb , uniquely up to tensoring with a \"line bundle\" - a representation L of\nCorb such that L \u2297C L\u2032 \u223c\n= Corb for some L\u2032 .\norb\n\n57\n\n\fsection 7.5 that the category of boundary conditions for the gauged theory C is a natural\nenrichment of the category for the orbifold theory, at least in the semisimple case.\n\nIt might come as a surprise that the cross-product algebra of spacetime A(X) \u00d7 G is\n\nnot the appropriate Frobenius algebra for G-equivariant topological field theory, in view of\nthe occurrence of the crossed-product algebra as a central concept in the theory of D-branes\non orbifolds developed in [49][50][51]. In fact, this fits in very nicely with the philosophy of\nthis paper. The Turaev algebra remembers the points of X, and so allows only the \"little\nloops\" above. In this way the sewing conditions - which are meant to formalize worldsheet\nlocality - also encode a crude form of spacetime locality.\nWe shall conclude this section by making contact with the usual path integral expression for the orbifold partition function on a torus. To do this we compute dim Corb\n\nby computing the projection onto G-invariant states in C. Note that \u03b1g (lh,x ) is only\n\nproportional to lh,x when [g, h] = 1 and gx = x, and then\n\u03b1g (lh,x ) =\n\nbx (g, h)\nlh,x\nbx (h, g)\n\nwhere we have combined (7.16) with the cocycle identity. Thus we find\nX bx (g, h)\n1 X\ndim Corb =\n|G|\nbx (h, g)\ngh=hg x=gx=hx\n\nFig. 24: The wavy line is a constrained boundary.

Sewing conditions for equivariant open and closed theory\nLet us now pass on to consider G-equivariant open and closed theories. We enlarge\n59\n\n\fFig. 29: The G-twisted adjoint relation.\n\nFig. 30: The G-twisted Cardy condition. In the double-twist diagram the holonomy around P1 is 1 and the holonomy around P2 is g.\n\nthe category SG so that the objects are oriented 1-manifolds w ith boundary, with labelled\n\nends, equipped with principal G-bundles. The morphisms are the same cobordisms as in\n\nthe non-equivariant case, but equipped with G-bundles. Up to isomorphism there is only\none G-bundle on the interval: it is trivial, and admits G as an automorphism group. So an\nequivariant theory gives us for each pair a, b of labels a vector space Oab with a G-action.\n\nThe action of g \u2208 G on Oab can be regarded as coming from the \"square\" cobordism with\n\nthe bundle whose holonomy is g along each of its \"constrained\" edges. There is also a\n\ncomposition law Oab \u00d7 Obc \u2192 Oac , which is G-equivariant. These are illustrated in fig. 24\n\nand fig. 25.\n\nIn the open/closed case the conditions analogous to equations (2.2) to (2.12) are the\nfollowing.\nFocussing first on a single label a, we have a not necessarily commutative Frobenius\n60\n\n\falgebra (Oaa = O, \u03b8O ) together with a G-action \u03c1 : G \u2192 Aut(O):\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c1g (\u03c81 \u03c82 ) = \u03c1g \u03c81 \u03c1g \u03c82\n\n(7.19)\n\nwhich preserves the trace \u03b8O (\u03c1g \u03c8) = \u03b8O (\u03c8). See fig. 26.\nThere are also G-twisted open/closed transition maps\n\u03b9g,a = \u03b9g : Cg \u2192 Oaa = O\n\u03b9g,a = \u03b9g : Oaa = O \u2192 Cg\nwhich are equivariant:\nCg1\n\u2193 \u03b9g1\nO\n\n\u03b1 g2\n\n\u2192\n\nCg2 g1 g2 \u22121\n\u2193 \u03b9g2 g1 g2 \u22121\n\n\u03c1g2\n\n\u2192\n\n\u22121\n\ng1 g2\n\nO\n\n(7.21)\n\nO\n\n\u03b1 g2\n\nCg2 \u22121 g1 g2\n\u03b9g2\n\n(7.20)\n\n\u2191\n\n\u2192\n\nCg1\n\n\u03c1g2\n\n\u2191 \u03b9g1\nO\n\n\u2192\n\n(7.22)\n\nThese maps are illustrated in fig. 27. The open/closed maps must satisfy the G-twisted\nversions of conditions 3a-3e of section 2.2. In particular, the map \u03b9 : C \u2192 O obtained by\n\nputting the \u03b9g together is a ring homomorphism, i.e.\n\u03b9g1 (\u03c61 )\u03b9g2 (\u03c62 ) = \u03b9g2 g1 (\u03c62 \u03c61 )\n\n\u2200\u03c61 \u2208 Cg1 , \u03c62 \u2208 Cg2 .\n\n(7.23)\n\nSince the identity is in C1 the condition (2.8) is unchanged. The G-twisted centrality\ncondition is\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Cg , \u03c8 \u2208 O.\n\n\u03b9g (\u03c6)(\u03c1g \u03c8)) = \u03c8\u03b9g (\u03c6)\n\n(7.24)\n\nand is illustrated in fig. 28.\nThe G-twisted adjoint condition is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b8O \u03c8\u03b9g \u22121 (\u03c6) = \u03b8C \u03b9g (\u03c8)\u03c6)\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Cg \u22121 .\n\n(7.25)\n\nand is shown in fig. 29.\nFinally, the G-twisted Cardy conditions restrict not only each algebra Oaa , but also\n\nthe spaces of morphisms Oab between labels b and a. For each g \u2208 G we must have\n\u03c0g,ba = \u03b9g,b \u03b9g,a\n61\n\n(7.26)\n\n\fHere \u03c0g,ba is defined by\n\u03c0g,ba (\u03c8) =\n\nX\n\u03bc\n\n\u0001\n\u03c8 \u03bc \u03c8 \u03c1 g \u03c8\u03bc ,\n\n(7.27)\n\nwhere we sum over a basis \u03c8\u03bc for Oab , and take \u03c8 \u03bc to be the dual basis of Oba . See fig. 30.\nWe may now formulate\n\nTheorem 7\n\nThe above conditions form a complete set of sewing conditions for G-\n\nequivariant open/closed 2d TFT.\nThis will be proved in the appendix. Note that the above axioms are slightly redundant\nsince (7.21) and (7.25) together imply (7.22).\n7.5. Solution of the sewing conditions for semisimple C\nWe now show that, when C is semisimple, the solutions of the above sewing conditions\n\nare provided by G-equivariant bundles on X = Spec(C1 ) twisted by the B-field defined by\nC.\n\nLet us first say a word about these bundles. To give a finite dimensional representation\n\nof the cross-product algebra A(X) \u00d7 G is to give a representation of A(X) - i.e. a vector\n\nbundle E on X - together with an intertwining action of G. Thus representations of\n\nA(X) \u00d7 G are precisely G-vector-bundles on X. For a finite group G there are many\n\nequivalent ways of defining the notion of a twisted G-vector-bundle on X, twisted by a B-\n\n2\nfield b representing an element of HG\n(X;C\u00d7 ): the simplest for our purposes is to say that\n\na twisted bundle is just a representation of A(X) \u00d7b G. (Unfortunately this description\n\ndoes not work when G is not finite, and so it is not the one used in [52] . We shall explain\nthe relationship with the description of [52] at the end of this subsection.)\nThe problem is easily reduced to consideration of a single G-orbit, so we may assume\nX = G/H for some subgroup H of G. Accordingly, the closed string Frobenius data is\nspecified by a 2-cocycle b and a single constant \u03b8c \u2208 C\u00d7 defining the trace: \u03b8(lg,x) = \u03b4g,1 \u03b8c .\n\nAs usual, the isomorphism class only depends on [b] \u2208 H 2 (H;C\u00d7 ).\nTheorem 8\n\nLet C = T (X, b, \u03b8c) be a Turaev algebra with C1 semisimple and X =\n\nG/H. For a single label a the most general solution O = Oaa of the sewing constraints is\n\u221a\ndetermined by a choice of square-root \u03b8o = \u03b8c and a projective representation V of H\nwith the cocycle bo which is the restriction of b.\n62\n\n\fX:\n\nThe algebra O is the algebra of sections of the G-equivariant bundle of algebras over\n\u0001\n\u0001\nO := \u0393 G \u00d7H (End(V )) = IndG\nH End(V ) ,\n\n(7.28)\n\nX\n\n(7.29)\n\nand the trace is determined by \u03b8o :\n\n\u03b8O (\u03a8) = \u03b8o\n\nTrV (\u03a8(x)).\n\nx\u2208G/H\n\nProof\nLet us suppose that we have a Turaev algebra C with C1 semisimple, together with\n\nO, \u03b8O , \u03b9g , \u03b9g satisfying the sewing conditions. Let X be the G-space Spec(C1 ). Then, from\n\nour results in the non-equivariant case, we know that O = EndC1 (\u0393(End(E))) for some\n\nvector bundle E \u2192 X, unique up to tensoring wtih a line bundle L \u2192 X. Thus O = \u2295Ox ,\n\nwhere Ox = End(Ex ). We also know that the trace on O must be given by (3.7) . The\n\nsame square-root \u03b8o of \u03b8x must be taken for each x \u2208 X to make \u03b8 : O \u2192 C invariant under\n\nG. Now G acts compatibly on C1 and O by algebra isomorphisms, so g \u2208 G maps Ox0 to\n\nOx by an algebra isomorphism. This proves (7.28) , where V = Ex0 . Finally, the Turaev\n\nalgebra C is the product \u2295Cx , where Cx is the twisted group-ring of Gx with the twisting\n\nbx . The algebra homomorphism C \u2192 O makes Cx act on Ex , and so V is a projective\nrepresentation of H = Gx0 with the cocycle bx0 .\n\nThis proves that O is of the form stated. One must still check that the definition\n\n(7.28) does provide a solution of the sewing conditions, but that presents no problems.\n\nRemark Although in the hypothesis of the theorem we were given a cocycle b representing\n2\nan element of HG\n(X;C\u00d7 ), the conclusion uses only its restriction bx0 . This should not\n2\nsurprise us, as cohomologous cocycles b define isomorphic Turaev algebras, and HG\n(X;C\u00d7 )\n2\nis canonically isomorphic to the group cohomology HH\n(point;C\u00d7 ) when X = G/H.\n\nWe can now deduce a complete description of the category of boundary conditions,\nusing exactly the same arguments by which we obtained Theorem 3 from Theorem 2.\nTheorem 9\n\nIf C is a Turaev algebra with C1 semisimple, corresponding to a space-time\n\nX with a B-field b, then the category of boundary conditions for C is equivalent to the\ncategory of b-twisted G-vector-bundles on X, uniquely up to tensoring with a G-line-bundle\n\non X. Its Frobenius structure is determined by a choice of the dilaton field \u03b8.\n63\n\n\fThe meaning of this theorem needs to be explained. The linear category of equivariant boundary conditions for a given Turaev algebra is an example of what is called an\n\"enriched\" category: for each pair of objects a, b the vector space Oab has an action of\nthe group G. Now the category VectG of finite dmensional vector spaces with G-action is\n\na symmetric tensor category, with the neutral object C. To say that we have a category\nenriched in a tensor category such as VectG means that we have\n(i) a set of objects,\n(ii) for each pair a, b of objects an object Oab of VectG , and\n\n(iii) for each triple a, b, c of objects an associative \"composition\" morphism\nOab \u2297 Obc \u2192 Oac\n\nof G-vector spaces.\nThe axioms are almost identical to the axioms for a category, but the space of morphisms has extra structure. In such a situation the category is said to be an enrichment\nof the ordinary linear category in which the morphisms from b to a are F (Oab ), where\nF : VectG \u2192 Vect is the functor defined by F (V ) = HomG (C; V ) = V G . There is, how-\n\never, another ordinary category associated to the enriched category by simply forgetting\nthe G-action, so that the morphisms from b to a are simply Oab as a vector space.\n\nAn example of a category enriched in VectG is the category of finite dimensional rep-\n\nresentations of G\u0303, where G\u0303 is a central extension (with a fixed cocycle) of G by the circle,\nwhere the central circle acts by scalar multiplication. Indeed, given two such representations V1\u2217 \u2297 V2 is a representation of G.\n\nTheorem 9 should really be expanded as follows. The category of b-twisted G-vector-\n\nbundles on X has a natural enrichment in VectG , in which the G-vector space of morphisms\nconsists of the homomorphisms of b-twisted vector bundles which are not necessarily equivariant with respect to the G-action. This enrichment is equivalent to the category of equivariant boundary conditions. The underlying ordinary category is the category of boundary\nconditions for the orbifold theory.\nTheorem 9 has a converse, which is the G-equivariant extension of the discussion of\n\u00a73.3\nTheorem 10\n\nIf B is a linear category enriched in VectG , with G-equivariant traces\n\nmaking it a Frobenius category, and the linear category obtained from B by forgetting the\n64\n\n\fG-action is semisimple with finitely many irreducible objects, then B is equivalent to the\n\ncategory of equivariant boundary conditions for a canonical equivariant topological field\ntheory. The Turaev algebra defining the theory is \u2295g Cg , where an element of Cg is a family\n\n\u03c6a \u2208 Oaa , indexed by the objects a of B, satisfying\n\n\u03c6a \u25e6 f = (g.f ) \u25e6 \u03c6b\n\n(7.30)\n\nfor each f \u2208 Oab .\n\nTo prove this, one must show that (7.30) really does define a Turaev algebra. The\n\ndetails are straightforward and we will omit them.\n7.6. Equivariant boundary states\nTo conclude our discussion, let us consider the equivariant analogues of the \"boundary\nstates\" discussed in \u00a74. Our notion of the category of boundary conditions for a G-gauged\n\ntheory is intrinsically G-invariant, and we have already pointed out that it gives us exactly\nthe same category as we would obtain from the orbifold theory in which we have summed\nover the gauge fields. To reformulate this in terms of boundary states we begin with the\ndefinition.\nIn the gauged theory associated to a Turaev algebra C = T (X, b, \u03b8) the observables at\n\nany point of the world-sheet are precisely the elements of C. The boundary state Ba \u2208 C\n\nassociated to a boundary condition a is characterized by the property that the correlation\nfunction of observables \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6k evaluated at points of a surface \u03a3 with boundary S 1\nwith the boundary condition a (and arbitrary holonomy around the boundary) is equal to\nthat of the same observables on the closed surface obtained by capping-off the boundary,\nwith the additional insertion of Ba at the centre of the cap. It suffices (because of the\nfactorization properties of a field theory) to check the case when \u03a3 is a disc. The correlation\nfunction on the disc is obtained by propagating \u03c61 . . . \u03c6k \u2208 Cg to H(\u2205) = C by the annulus\n\nwhose non-incoming boundary circle is constrained by the condition a, along which the\nholonomy is necessarily g. Our rules tell us that the result is\n\u03b8Oaa (\u03b9g,a (\u03c61 . . . \u03c6k )).\nEquating this to \u03b8C1 (\u03c61 . . . \u03c6k Ba ), we see that\nBa =\n\nX\ng\n\n65\n\n\u03b9g,a (1).\n\n\fThe map a 7\u2192 Ba evidently has its image in the G-invariant part - i.e. the centre -\n\nof the Turaev algebra. It extends to a homomorphism\n\nKG,h (X) \u2192 T (X, b, \u03b8)G ,\nand we have\nTheorem 11 The G-invariant boundary states generate a lattice in T (X, b, \u03b8)G related\nto the twisted equivariant K-theory via:\nKG,h (X) \u2297 C = T (X, b, \u03b8)G.\n\n(7.31)\n\nRemark\n1. Equation (7.31) is related to an old observation of [53]. If X = G with G acting on\nitself by conjugation then T (X, 0)G is the Verlinde algebra occuring in the conformal\nfield theory of orbifolds for chiral algebras with one representation [53]. The different\norbits are the conjugacy classes of G. Focusing on one conjugacy class [g] we can\ncompare with the above results. One basis of states is provided by a choice of a\ncharacter of the centralizer of g. These are just the G-invariant boundary states\nfound above.\n2. The translation of the above results to the language of branes at orbifolds is the\nfollowing. The boundary states corresponding to the different b-irreps Vi are the\n\"fractional branes\" of [49]. The use of projective representations was proposed in [49],\nand further explored in [54]. A different proof of the fact that the cocycle for the open\nsector and that of the closed sector b are cohomologous can be found in [55].\nTo conclude this section, let us return to explain the relation between the definition\nof twisted equivariant K-theory by A(X) \u00d7b G-modules and the definition given in [52] .\n\nIn [52] the elements of the twisted equivariant theory are described as follows. First,\n\n3\nthe twisting class b \u2208 HG\n(X; ZZ) is represented by a bundle P of projective Hilbert spaces\n\non X equipped with a G-action covering the G-action on X. Then elements of KG,P (X)\nare represented by families {Tx }x\u2208X of fibrewise Fredholm operators in the bundle P .\nLet us show how to associate such a pair (P, {Tx }) to a finitely generated A(X) \u00d7b G-\n\nmodule. Such a module is the same thing as a finitely generated A(X)-module equipped\n\nwith a compatible action of the extended group G\u0303 associated to b which we have already\n66\n\n\fdescribed. Equivalently, it is a finite dimensional vector bundle E on X with an action\nof G\u0303 on the total space which covers the action of G on X. Let us choose a fixed infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space H. Then \u00ca = E \u2297H is a Hilbert bundle on X, and the associated\n\nbundle P = IP(\u00ca) of projective spaces has a natural action of G, and it represents the\n3\nclass of b in HG\n(X; ZZ). (Cf. the proof of Proposition 6.3 in [52] .) If T : H \u2192 H is a fixed\n\nsurjective Fredholm operator with a one-dimensional kernel, then (identity)E \u2297 T : P \u2192 P\n\nrepresents an element of KG,P (X) according to the definition of [52] .\n\nIf the cocycle b is a coboundary - or even if bx (g1 , g2 ) is independent of x \u2208 X - it is\n\nplain that the two rival definitions of equivariant K coincide. A Mayer-Vietoris argument\ncan then be used to show that they coincide for all b.\n\nThe essential point here is that when X and G are finite the twisting class b is of\nfinite order, and that makes it possible to represent the K-classes by families of Fredholm\noperators of constant rank, and hence by finite dimensional vector bundles.\n\nAppendix A. Morse theory proof of the sewing theorems\nIn this appendix we shall use Morse theory to give uniform proofs of four theorems.\nThe first is the very well-known result that a two-dimensional topological field theory is\nprecisely encoded in a commutative Frobenius algebra. The second is the corresponding\nstatement for open and closed theories: this is Theorem 1 of Section 2 above. The third\nand fourth are the equivariant analogues of the first two, i.e. Theorems 4 and 7 of Section\n7.\nA.1. The classical theorem\nWe wish to prove that when we have a commutative Frobenius algebra C we can assign\n\nto an oriented cobordism \u03a3 from S0 to S1 a linear map\nU\u03a3 : C \u2297p \u2192 C \u2297q ,\n\nwhere the oriented 1-manifolds S0 and S1 have p and q connected components respectively.\nWe can always choose a smooth function f : \u03a3 \u2192 [0, 1] \u2282 IR such that f \u22121 (0) = S0\n\nand f \u22121 (1) = S1 , and which has only \"Morse\" singularities, i.e. the gradient df vanishes\nat only finitely many points x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 \u03a3, and\n\n(i) the Hessian d2 f (xi ) is a non-degenerate quadratic form for each i, and\n67\n\n\f(ii) the critical values c1 = f (x1 ), . . . , cn = f (xn ) are distinct, and not equal to 0 or\n1.\nEach critical point has an index, equal to 0, 1, or 2, which is the number of negative\neigenvalues of the Hessian d2 f (xi ).\nThe choice of the function f gives us a decomposition of the cobordism into \"elementary\" cobordisms. If\n0 = t0 < c1 < t1 < c2 < t2 < . . . < cn < tn = 1,\nand St = f \u22121 (t), then each Sti is a collection of, say, mi disjoint circles, with mi = mi\u22121 \u00b11,\n\nand \u03a3i = f \u22121 ([ti\u22121 , ti ]) is a cobordism from Sti\u22121 to Sti which is trivial (i.e. a union of\ncylinders) except for one connected component of one of the four forms of fig. 2.\nFor a given Frobenius algebra C we know how to define an operator\nU\u03a3i : C \u2297mi\u22121 \u2192 C \u2297mi\nin each case. (In the third case the map we assign is\n\n\u03c6 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i ,\n\nwhere {\u03c6i } and {\u03c6i } are dual bases of C such that \u03b8C (\u03c6i \u03c6j ) = \u03b4ij .) We should notice two\n\npoints. First, we need C to be commutative, for otherwise we would need to have an order\n\non the two incoming circles of a pair of pants, and no such order is given. Secondly, the\nassignments we make have the property that reversing the direction of time in a cobordism\nreplaces the operator by its adjoint with respect to the Frobenius inner product on the\nstate-spaces. This property will be a firm principle in all our constructions, and it reduces\nthe number of cases we have to check in the tedious arguments below.\n\nFig. 31:\n\n68\n\n\fThe important task now is to show that the composite operator U\u03a3n \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 U\u03a31 is\n\nindependent of the chosen Morse function f .\n\nTwo Morse functions f0 and f1 can always be connected by a smooth path {fs }0\u2264s\u22641\n\nin which fs is a Morse function except for a finite set of parameter values s at which one\nof the following two things happens:\n(i)\n\nfs has one degenerate critical point where in local coordinates (u, v) it has the\n\nform fs (u, v) = \u00b1u2 + v 3 , or\n(ii)\n\ntwo distinct critical points xi , xj of fs have the same critical value fs (xi ) =\n\nfs (xj ) = c.\nIn the first case, two critical points of adjacent indices are created or annihilated as the\nparameter passes through the non-Morse value s, and the cobordism changes by fig. 31.\nor vice-versa, or by the time-reversal of these pictures. The well-definedness of U\u03a3 under\nthis kind of change is ensured by the identity 1.a = a in the algebra C.\n\nCase (ii) is more problematical. Because operators of the form U \u2297 1 and 1 \u2297 U \u2032\n\ncommute, we easily see that there is nothing to prove unless the two critical points xi and\nxj are connected in the \"bad\" critical contour Sc , in which case they must both have index\n1.\nLet us consider the resulting two-step cobordism which is factorized in different ways\nbefore and after the critical parameter value s. It will have just one non-trivial connected\ncomponent, which, because an elementary cobordism changes the number of circles by 1,\nmust be a cobordism from p circles to q circles, where (p, q) = (1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3) or (3, 1).\nWe need to check only one of (1,3) and (3,1), as they differ only by time-reversal. Because\nthe Euler number of a cobordism is the number of critical points of its Morse function\n(counted with the sign (\u22121)index ), the non-trivial component has Euler number \u22122, so is\n\na 2-holed torus when (p, q) = (1, 1) and a 4-holed sphere in the other cases.\n\nFig. 33:\n\n69\n\n\fFig. 32:\n\nFig. 34:\n\nFig. 35:\n\nIn the case (1,1), depicted in fig. 32, a circle splits into two which then recombine.\nThere is nothing to check, because, though a torus with two holes can be cut into two pairs\nof pants by many different isotopy classes of cuts, there is only one possible composite\ncobordism, and we have only one possible composite map C \u2192 C \u2297 C \u2192 C.\n\nIn the case (3,1), two circles of the three combine, then the resulting circle combines\n\nwith the third. The picture is fig. 33. Clearly this case is covered by the associative law\nin C.\n\nIn the case (2,2) we are again factorizing a 4-holed sphere into two elementary cobor-\n\ndisms. This can be done in many ways, as we see from the pictures fig. 34. The best way\nof making sure we are not overlooking any possibility is to think of the contour just below\n70\n\n\fthe doubly-critical level, which, if it consists of two circles, must have one of the two forms\n(i) or (ii) in fig. 35. (Consider the possible ways of connecting the \"terminals\" inside the\ndotted circles.) But, whatever happens, the only algebraic maps the cobordism can lead\nto are\nC\u2297C \u2192C \u2192C \u2297C\nand\nC \u2297 C \u2192 C \u2297 C \u2297 C \u2192 C \u2297 C,\ngiven by\n\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u2032 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03c6\u2032 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6\u2032 \u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i\n\nand\n\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u2032 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6\u2032 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i \u03c6\u2032\n\nrespectively, where {\u03c6i } and {\u03c6i } are dual bases of C such that \u03b8C (\u03c6i \u03c6j ) = \u03b4ij . These two\n\nmaps are equal because of the identity\nX\n\n\u03c6\u2032 \u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i \u03c6\u2032 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhich holds in any Frobenius algebra because the inner product of each side with \u03c6j \u2297 \u03c6k\nis \u03b8C (\u03c6j \u03c6\u2032 \u03c6k ).\n\nThat completes the proof of the theorem: notice that we have used all the axioms of\na commutative Frobenius algebra.\nA.2. Open and closed theories\nAs in the preceding argument we consider a cobordism \u03a3 from S0 to S1 , but now S0\nand S1 are collections of circles and intervals, and the boundary \u2202\u03a3 has a constrained part\n\u2202constr \u03a3, which we shall abbreviate to \u2202 \u2032 \u03a3, which is a cobordism from \u2202S0 to \u2202S1 . We\nchoose f : \u03a3 \u2192 [0, 1] as before, but now there are two kinds of critical points of f : interior\n\npoints of \u03a3 at which the gradient df vanishes, and points of \u2202 \u2032 \u03a3 at which the gradient of the\nrestriction of f to the boundary vanishes. For an internal critical point, \"nondegenerate\"\nhas its usual meaning. A critical point x on the boundary is called nondegenerate if it is\na nondegenerate critical point of the restriction of f to \u2202 \u2032 \u03a3, and in addition the derivative\nof f normal to the boundary does not vanish at x.\n71\n\n\fAs before, f is a Morse function if all its critical points are non-degenerate, and all\nthe critical values are distinct and 6= 0, 1. We can always choose such a function.\n\nThere are now four kind of boundary critical points, which we can denote 0\u00b1, 1\u00b1,\n\nrecording the index and the sign of the normal derivative. Six things can happen as\nwe pass through one of them. At those of type 0+ or 1\u2212, an open string is created or\nannihilated. At type 0\u2212 either two open strings join end-to-end, or else an open string\nbecomes a closed string. Type 1+ is the time-reverse of 0\u2212. If we have a Frobenius\ncatgegory B, we know what to do in each of the six cases.\n\nFig. 36:\n\nAn internal critical point has index 0,1, or 2, as before. Only if the index is 1 can\nthe corresponding cobordism involve an open string. Up to time reversal, there are three\nindex 1 processes: two closed strings can become one, an open string can \"absorb\" a closed\nstring, and two open strings can \"reorganize themselves\" to form two new open strings as\nin fig. 36.\nFor a given Frobenius category B, we assign to (open)+(closed)\u2192(open) the map\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab\ngiven by \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03c8. (Here, as we usually do, we are regarding Oab as a C-module,\n\nwriting\n\n\u03c6\u03c8 = \u03b9a (\u03c6)\u03c8 = \u03b9b (\u03c6)\u03c8.)\nTo (open)+(open)\u2192(open)+(open) we assign the map\nOab \u2297 Ocd \u2192 Oad \u2297 Ocb\ngiven by\n\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03c8i \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 \u03c8 i ,\n\nwhere \u03c8i and \u03c8 i are dual bases of Obd and Odb .\n72\n\n\fWe must now consider what happens when we change the Morse function. As before,\ntwo Morse functions can be connected by a path {fs } in which each fs is a Morse function\n\nexcept for finitely many values of s at which either one critical point is degenerate or else\n\ntwo critical values coincide. We begin with the degenerate case. There are now three kinds\nof degeneracy which we must allow, for besides internal degeneracies which are just as in\nthe closed string case we can have two kinds of degeneracy on the boundary: either f |\u2202 \u2032 \u03a3\n\nhas a cubic inflexion, or else the normal derivative vanishes at a boundary critical point.\n\nFig. 37:\n\nWhen s passes through a boundary inflexion, two nondegenerate boundary critical\npoints of opposite index but with normal derivatives of the same sign are created or annihilated. This means that the cobordism changes between figures (i) and (ii) of fig. 37\n(or the time-reversal). These changes are covered by the axiom that the category B has\n\nidentity morphisms.\n\nWhen the normal derivative vanishes at a boundary critical point what happens is\nthat an internal critical point has moved \"across the boundary of \u03a3, i.e. it moves into\ncoincidence with a boundary critical point and changes the sign of the normal derivative\nthere. There are four cases:\n(0\u2212) + (index 0) \u2192 (0+),\n(0+) + (index 1) \u2192 (0\u2212),\nand the time-reversals of these. In the first case, the composite cobordism in which a small\nclosed string is created and then breaks open is replaced by the elementary cobordism in\nwhich an open string is created. This corresponds to the axiom that C \u2192 Oaa takes 1C to\n\n1a . In the second case, in the composite cobordism, an open string is created, and then it\neither \"absorbs\" an existing closed string or else \"rearranges\" itself with an existing open\nstring; these composites are to be equivalent, respectively, to the elementary breaking of\n73\n\n\fa closed or open string. Putting \u03c8 = 1a in the formulae above we see that this is allowed\nby the Frobenius category axioms.\nWhen we have an internal degenerate critical point, what happens, up to time-reversal,\nis that a closed string is created and then joins an existing open or closed string; this should\nbe the same as the trivial cobordism. Again, the unit axioms cover this.\n\nFig. 38:\n\nFig. 39:\n\nFinally, we have to consider what happens when two critical values cross. They can\nbe two boundary critical points, two internal ones, or one of each.\nIf two boundary critical points are linked by a critical contour, it has the form fig. 38.\nThese give us four cases to check, where the contour below the critical level is fig. 39.\nCase (i)a is accounted for by the associativity of composition in the category B; case (i)b\n\nby the open-string analogue of the identity (A.1); case (ii)a by the trace axiom \u03b9a (\u03c81 \u03c82 ) =\n\u03b9b (\u03c82 \u03c81 ), which follows by combining (cyclic),(center),and (adjoint); and case (ii)b by the\nCardy identity.\n74\n\n\fFig. 40:\n\nWhen we have one boundary and one internal critical point at the same level we may\nas well assume the boundary point is of type 0\u2212 and the internal critical point is of index\n1, and that they are joined in the critical contour,which must have one of the four forms\nfig. 40.\nAt the boundary point either an open string becomes closed, or else two open strings\njoin. We shall consider each possibility in turn. In the first case, if the boundary point is\nencountered first, then at the interior point three things can happen: the closed string can\nsplit into two closed strings, or it can combine with another closed or open string. Thus\nthe possibilities are\no \u2192 c \u2192 c + c\no + c \u2192 c + c \u2192 c\no + o \u2192 c + o \u2192 o.\nWhen the internal point is encountered first there is only one possibility in each case, and\nthe three sequences are replaced respectively by\no \u2192 o + c \u2192 c + c\no + c \u2192 o \u2192 c\no + o \u2192 o + o \u2192 o.\nWe have to check three identities. The first two reduce to the fact that \u03b9a : Oaa \u2192 C is a\n\nmap of modules over C. The third is the Cardy condition.\n\nNow let us consider the case where two open strings join at the boundary critical\n\npoint. If we meet the boundary point first, there are again three things that can happen at\nthe internal critical point: the open string can emit a closed string, or else it can interact\nwith another closed or open string. The possibilities are\n75\n\n\fo + o \u2192 o \u2192 o + c\no + o + c \u2192 o + c \u2192 o\no + o + o \u2192 o + o \u2192 o + o.\nIn the second and third of these cases there is only one thing that can happen when the\norder of the critical points is reversed: they become\n\no + o + c \u2192 o + o \u2192 o\no + o + o \u2192 o + o + o \u2192 o + o.\nThe identities relating the corresponding algebraic maps Oab \u2297 Obc \u2297 C \u2192 Oac and Oab \u2297\n\nObc \u2297 Ode \u2192 Oae \u2297 Odc are immediate.\n\nThe first sequence, however, can become either\no + o \u2192 o + o + c \u2192 o + c\nor\no + o \u2192 o + o \u2192 o + c.\nThe first of these presents nothing of interest algebraically, but to deal with the second we\nneed to check that\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 \u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03c8 k \u2297 \u03b9b (\u03c8 \u2032 \u03c8k )\n\nfor \u03c8 \u2208 Oab , \u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 Obc , and dual bases \u03c6i , \u03c6i of C and \u03c8 k , \u03c8k of Obc , Ocb . This relation\nholds because the inner product of the left-hand side with \u03c8m \u2297 \u03c6j is \u03b8b (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 \u03c6j \u03c8m ), while\n\nthe inner product of the right-hand side with \u03c8m \u2297 \u03c6j is\nX\nk\n\n\u03b8b (\u03c8\u03c8 k \u03c8m )\u03b8(\u03b9b (\u03c8 \u2032 \u03c8k )\u03c6j ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b8b (\u03c8m \u03c8\u03c8 k )\u03b8b (\u03c8k \u03c6j \u03c8 \u2032 )\n(A.2)\n\nk\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= \u03b8b (\u03c8m \u03c8\u03c6j \u03c8 ) = \u03b8b (\u03c8\u03c8 \u03c6j \u03c8m ).\n\n76\n\n\fFig. 41:\n\nFig. 42:\n\nFig. 43:\n\n77\n\n\fFinally, we must consider what happens when there are two internal critical points\non the same level. Here we have the possibilities which we have already discussed in the\nclosed case, but must also allow any or all of the strings involved to be open. We can\nanalyse the situation according to the number of connected components of the part of\nthe contour immediately below the doubly critical level which pass close to the critical\npoints. There must be one, two, or three such components. If there are three they can\nform five configurations (apart from the case when all three are closed), as depicted in\nfig. 41. The well-definedness of the composite map in all these cases follows immediately\nfrom the associative law of composition in the Frobenius category.\nIf there are two components below the critical level then they can again form five\nconfigurations (for either the two components meet twice, or else they meet once, and one\nof them has a self-interaction), depicted in fig. 42. But we have only three cases to check,\nas the second is the time-reversal of one from fig. 41, and the last two are time-reversals\nof each other. Case 15(i) corresponds to the fact that the composition\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2192 Oab \u2297 C\ncan be effected by cutting the composite cobordism in different ways, but there is nothing\nto check, as there is only one possible algebraic map.\nIn fig. 42 case(iii), one order of the critical points gives us the same composition\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2192 Oab \u2297 C\nas before, while the other order gives\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2297 C \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2297 C;\nbut it is very easy to check that both maps take \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c6 to\n\nhave already used.\n\nP\n\n\u03c8\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i in the notaion we\n\nIn fig. 42 case(iii) we must again compare compositions\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2297 C \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2297 C\nand\nOab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab \u2192 Oab \u2297 C.\n78\n\n\fThis time we must check that\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i \u03c6 =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i .\n\nThis is the same formula which we met at the end of our discussion of closed string theories.\nFinally, suppose that the contour below the critical level has only one connected\ncomponent. There are three possible configurations, corresponding to the three ways of\npairing four points on an interval. They are fig. 43. The first two of these are time-reversals\nof cases we have already treated. The last one leads - in either order - to a factorization\nOab \u2192 Oab \u2297 C \u2192 Oab .\nThere is only one possibility for this, so there is nothing to check.\nThat completes the proof of the theorem about open and closed theories.\n\nFig. 44:\n\nFig. 45:\n\n79\n\n\fFig. 46:\n\nFig. 47:\n\nA.3. Equivariant closed theories\nWe must now redo the discussion in the first part of this appendix, but for surfaces\nand circles equipped with a principal G-bundle, where G is a given finite group.\nThe first observation is that any circle with a bundle is isomorphic to a standard bundle\nSg with holonomy g \u2208 G on the standard circle S 1 . Furthermore the set of morphisms\n\nfrom Sg to Sg \u2032 is {h \u2208 G : hgh\u22121 = g \u2032 }. In other words, the category of bundles on S 1 is\nequivalent to the category G//G formed by the group G acting on itself by conjugation.\nAn equivariant theory therefore gives us a vector space Cg for each g, and together the Cg\n\nform a G-vector-bundle on G. Conversely, given the G-vector-bundle {Cg } and a circle S\n\nwith a bundle P on it, the theory gives us the vector space H(S, P ) whose elements are\n\nrules which associate \u03c8x,t \u2208 Cgx,t to each x \u2208 S and trivialization t : Px \u2192 G, where gx,t\nis the holonomy of P with base-point (x, t), and we require that\n\u03c8x\u2032 ,t\u2032 = g\u03c8x,t\n80\n\n\fif g is the holonomy of P along the positive path from (x, t) to (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ). For this to be\nwell-defined we need the condition that gx,t acts trivially on Cgx,t , whose necessity we have\n\nalready explained in Section 7.\n\nNext we consider the trivial cobordism from Sg to Sg \u2032 . The possible extensions of\nthe bundles on the ends over the cylinder correspond to the possible holonomies from the\nincoming base-point to the outgoing base-point, i.e. to the set of morphisms {h \u2208 G :\n\nhgh\u22121 = g \u2032 } in G//G. Clearly these cylinders induce the isomorphisms Cg \u2192 Cg \u2032 which\n\nwe already know. But two such cobordisms are to regarded as equivalent if there is a\ndiffeomorphism from the cylinder (with its bundle) to itself which is the identity on the\nends. The mapping-class group of the cylinder is generated by the Dehn twist around it,\nso the morphism corresponding to h is equivalent to that for hg = g \u2032 h. This means that g\nmust act trivially on Cg , as we already know.\n\nNow we come to the possible bundles on the four elementary cobordisms of diagram\n\n1. The bundle on a cap must of course be trivial. The pair-of-pants cobordisms that are\nrelevant to us arise as the regions between nearby level curves separated by a critical level.\nWe can draw them as in fig. 44, where the solid contour is below the critical level, and the\ndashed one is above it. We can trivialize the G-bundle in the neighbourhood of the critical\npoint (i.e. within the dotted circles), and then the bundle on the cobordism is determined\nby giving the holonomies g1 , g2 along the ribbons, as indicated. The operator we associate\nto case (i) is the multiplication map\nmg1 ,g2 : Cg1 \u2297 Cg2 \u2192 Cg1 g2\nof ((7.1)). In writing it this way we are choosing an ordering of the ribbons, i.e. a base-point\non the outgoing loop. The two orderings are related by the conjugation\n\u03b1g2 : Cg1 g2 \u2192 Cg2 g1 ,\nso the consistency condition for us to have a well-defined assignment is that\nmg2 ,g1 (\u03c82 \u2297 \u03c81 ) = \u03b1g2 (mg1 ,g2 (\u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82 )).\nWe see that this holds in any Turaev algebra by combining ((7.3)) with the facts that G\nacts on the algebra by algebra-automorphisms, and that \u03b1g2 acts trivially on Cg2 . As the\nmapping-class group of the pair of pants is generated by the three Dehn twists parallel to\n81\n\n\fits boundary circles, there are no new conditions needed to make the assignment of the\noperator to the pair of pants well-defined.\nThe homomorphism\ncg1 ,g2 : Cg1 g2 \u2192 Cg1 \u2297 Cg2\ncorresponding to the coordism 17(ii) is fixed by the requirement of adjunction, bearing in\nmind that the dual space to Cg is Cg \u22121 . It is given by\ncg1 ,g2 (\u03c6) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i ,\n\nwhere {\u03c6i } is a basis for Cg2 , and {\u03c6i } is the dual basis of Cg \u22121 .\n2\n\nAny cobordism with a bundle can be factorized by Morse theory just as before; bundles are inherited by the elementary cobordisms. The difficult part of the discussion is\nconsidering what happens when we change the Morse function. But in fact the only step\nwhich presents anything significant is the consideration of the interchange of two critical\npoints of index 1 on the same level, i.e. the cobordisms of fig. 32, fig. 33, fig. 34.\nLet us consider the case fig. 32, where a string divides and then rejoins - i.e. a\ntorus with two holes, one incoming and one outgoing. We draw the picture in the form\nfig. 45. (We do not draw it in the apparently more perspicuous form fig. 46, as then the\nneighbourhoods of the two critical points would have opposite orientation in the plane.)\nThe cobordism corresponds to a map C4321 \u2192 C2341 , where, as in the following, we\n\nhave abbreviated Cg4 g3 g2 g1 to C4321 . If the left-hand critical point is encountered first, the\nmap we obtain is\n\nC4321 \u2192 C43 \u2297 C21 \u223c\n= C34 \u2297 C12 \u2192 C3412 \u223c\n= C2341 ,\n\u03c6 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03b13 (\u03c6\u03c6i ) \u2297 \u03b11 (\u03c6i ) 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03b13 (\u03c6\u03c6i )\u03b11 (\u03c6i ) 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03b12 (\u03b13 (\u03c6\u03c6i )\u03b11 (\u03c6i )),\n\nwhere \u03c6i runs through a basis for C21 , and we write \u03b13 for \u03b1g3 , and so on. (The maps\n\u223c in the previous line correspond to moving the choice of base-point on the\nindicated by =\nvarious strings.)\nWith the other order, we get\nC4321 \u223c\n= C23 \u2297 C41 \u2192 C2341\n= C3214 \u2192 C32 \u2297 C14 \u223c\n\u03c6 7\u2192 \u03b1\u22121\n4 (\u03c6) 7\u2192\n\nX\n\ni\n\u03b1\u22121\n4 (\u03c6)\u03c8 \u2297\u03c8i 7\u2192\n\nX\n\ni\n\u03b12 (\u03b1\u22121\n4 (\u03c6)\u03c8 ))\u2297\u03b14 (\u03c8i ) 7\u2192\n\n82\n\nX\n\ni\n\u03b12 (\u03b1\u22121\n4 (\u03c6)\u03c8 )\u03b14 (\u03c8i ),\n\n\fwhere \u03c8i runs through a basis of C14 .\n\nThus we must prove that\nX\nX\n\u03b123 (\u03c6\u03c6i )\u03c6i =\n\u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6)\u03b12 (\u03c8 i )\u03b14 (\u03c8i ).\n\nWe can deduce this from the axiom (newax) of \u00a77, with h = g2 g4\u22121 g1\u22121 g2\u22121 and g = g1\u22121 g2\u22121 ,\nas follows. We rewrite the right-hand side of the equation as\nX\n\u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6)\u03be i \u03b1g (\u03bei ),\n\nwhere \u03be i is the basis \u03b12 (\u03c8 i ) of Ch , so that \u03bei = \u03b12 (\u03c8i ) and \u03b1g (\u03bei ) = \u03b1\u22121\n1 (\u03c8i ) = \u03b14 (\u03c8i ). By\n\nthe axiom this equals\n\nX\n\nFinally,\n\n\u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6)\u03b1h (\u03b7 i )\u03b7i =\n\nX\n\n\u03b124\u22121 \u03b1h (\u03c6i )\u03c6i .\n\n\u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6)\u03b1h (\u03c6i ) = \u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6\u03c6i ) = \u03b123 (\u03c6\u03c6i ),\nbecause \u03c6\u03c6i \u2208 C43 , and so \u03b124\u22121 (\u03c6\u03c6i ) = \u03b124\u22121 \u03b143 (\u03c6\u03c6i ) = \u03b123 (\u03c6\u03c6i ). Thus we have dealt\n\nwith the case of fig. 32.\n\nIf fact this case is decidedly the most complicated of the set. We shall do one more,\nnamely case (i) of fig. 35, in which two strings join and then split. We draw the diagram\nas in fig. 47, corresponding to the two compositions\nC43 \u2297 C21 \u2192 C4321 \u223c\n= C41 \u2297 C23\n= C1432 \u2192 C14 \u2297 C32 \u223c\nC43 \u2297 C21 \u223c\n= C4123 \u2192 C41 \u2297 C23 .\n= C34 \u2297 C12 \u2192 C3412 \u223c\nThe first sequence gives us\n\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192 \u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192 \u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 ) 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i \u2297 \u03c6i 7\u2192\n\nwhere \u03c6i is a basis for C32 . The second sequence gives\n\nX\n\n\u03b14 (\u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i ) \u2297 \u03b12 (\u03c6i ),\n\n\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192 \u03b13 (\u03c8) \u2297 \u03b11 (\u03c8 \u2032 ) 7\u2192 \u03b13 (\u03c8)\u03b11 (\u03c8 \u2032 ) 7\u2192 \u03c8\u03b13\u22121 1 (\u03c8 \u2032 ) 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u03b13\u22121 1 (\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c8 i \u2297 \u03c8i ,\n\nwhere \u03c8i is a basis for C23 . But we can assume that \u03c8i = \u03b12 (\u03c6i ), and hence that \u03c8 i =\n\n\u03b12 (\u03c6i ). So, noticing that \u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i \u2208 C14 , and hence that\n\n\u03b14 (\u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i ) = \u03b1\u22121 (\u03b11 (\u03c8\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i ),\nwhat we need to prove is just that\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u03b1\u22121 (\u03c6i ) = \u03b13\u22121 (\u03b11 (\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i ).\nThis is true because \u03b11 (\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c6i \u2208 C13\u22121 , and so is fixed by \u03b113\u22121 .\nWe shall leave the remaining verifications to the reader.\n83\n\n\fFig. 48:\n\nFig. 49:\n\nA.4. Equivariant open and closed theories\nWe now have to redo the open and closed case taking account of G-bundles on the\ncobordisms.\nWe assign the vector space Oab to an open string from b to a equipped with a trivial-\n\nization of the bundle on it. Changing the trivialization by an element g \u2208 G corresponds\n\nto the action \u03c1g of g on Oab , which also corresponds to the map induced by a rectangular\n\ncobordism with holonomy g along its constrained edges.\n\nWe must consider the maps to be associated to the elementary cobordisms corresponding to the critical points of a Morse function. Up to time-reversal, two interesting\nthings can happen at a boundary critical point: either two open strings join end-to-end\nor an open string becomes closed. We have the pictures of fig. 48. As before, the solid\nline is the contour below the critical point, and the dashed line that above it. In 20(i),\nga , gb , gc are the holonomies between nearby points on the respective D-branes, expressed\nin terms of the chosen trivializations on the strings. (They satisfy gc gb = ga .) The map\nOab \u2297 Obc \u2192 Oac that we associate to this situation is\n\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192 \u03c1ga (\u03c8)\u03c1gb (\u03c8 \u2032 ).\n84\n\n\fThe dual operation Oac \u2192 Oab \u2297 Obc is\n\u03c8 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c1g1 (\u03c8\u03be i ) \u2297 \u03c1g2 (\u03bei ),\n\nwhere \u03bei and \u03be i are dual bases of Obc and Ocb .\n\nIn case (ii) of fig. 48, the open string becomes a closed string whose holonomy is g\n\nwith respect to the indicated base-point and the trivialization coming from the beginning\nof the open string. The corresponding map is \u03b9g , with adjoint \u03b9g .\nThere are also the two kinds of operation coming from internal critical points which\ninvolve open strings. They are illustrated in fig. 49.\nThe map Cg \u2297 Oab \u2192 Oab corresponding to 21(i) is \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c1ga (\u03b9g (\u03c6)\u03c8)), while the map\nOab \u2297 Ocd \u2192 Oad \u2297 Ocb corresponding to 21(ii) is\n\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2032 7\u2192\n\nX\n\n\u03c1ga (\u03c8)\u03c8i \u2297 \u03c1gc (\u03c8 \u2032 )\u03c1gb ga\u22121 (\u03c8 i ),\n\nwhere {\u03c8i } is a basis of Obd .\nWe now have all the same verifications to make as in the non-equivariant case. They\nare very tedious, but are in 1-1 correspondence with what we have already done, and\npresent nothing new. As an example of the modifications needed, let us point out that the\nvery frequently used formula A.1 which holds in any Frobenius category when \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 Oab\n\nand \u03c6i and \u03c6i are dual bases for Oab and Oba , generalizes - with the same proof - when\n\nthere is a G-action on the category to\nX\n\n\u03c6\u2032 \u03c6i \u2297 \u03b1g (\u03c6i ) =\n\nfor any g \u2208 G.\nWe shall say no more about the proof.\n\n85\n\nX\n\n\u03c6i \u2297 \u03b1g (\u03c6i \u03c6\u2032 )\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.
