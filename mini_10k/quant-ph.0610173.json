HISTORY\n\nTwentieth century physicists faced extraordinary challenges in terms of the scale of the phenomena to be explained.\nThe extremely small sizes of the objects covered by Quantum\nMechanics (QM) and the very large scale of events covered by\nRelativity, posed situations that were unimaginable within the\nthen customary understanding and concepts of science. This\nfostered, out of desperation, license to introduce theretofore\nunacceptably exotic hypotheses, (e.g., quantisation, frame independent light velocity) for which there was only indirect\nlaboratory evidence. At the same time, at least one desiderium\nwas assumed, largely without deep reflection, namely, that the\nnew theories under development were fundamental and complete (that is, that at their level they are theories of individual entities, not theories quantifying statistics of ensembles of\nsuch entities).\nHerein, I shall argue that the last mentioned assumption,\ncompleteness, is the key underlying cause that the exotic (and\narguably antirational) notions: irreality and nonlocality, have\nbeen ensconced in QM. The reasoning that led to this situation, was not concerned in the first instance with the philosophically problematic nature of these features, indeed the\nterms themselves, as well as their accepted technical denotation, appeared in the literature up to years later than the introduction of the mathematical structure to which they refer.\nFor the sake of expository efficiency, herein a reconstructed\nline of reasoning will be described that, I believe, is a composite of what happened, but not in the mind of any one person.\nThe actual development, to the extent that the historically true\nstory can be discerned at all in retrospect, was focused on finding the mathematical structure that mimicked those aspects of\nthe studied phenomena accessible to experiment, which were\nnearly always imagined to be just a portion of what happens\n'down deep'. In seeking these models or paradigms, however, it is clear that the founding fathers individually quite\nearly settled on a personally preferred paradigm, and tilted\ntheir analysis to support it. For QM, the accumulated effect,\nwarped by sociological factors, is what has become known as\nthe \"Copenhagen interpretation\".\nSome may be inclined to write off these concerns as 'mere\nphilosophy' of little interest \"during working hours\" to phys-\n\nical scientists. However, one can observe that, wherever there\nis a 'philosophical' issue, the mathematics in use is also afflicted with one or another pathology. Such a coincidence\nmakes perfect sense actually; mathematical problems (inconsistent or incomplete calculations) nearly always parallel verbal problems (erroneous syntax) insofar as mathematics is just\nthe use of symbols and formalised algorithms as a sort of\nshorthand for ideas originally expressed verbally. Indeed, all\nmathematics is taught by means of oral explanations. Philosophical problems, following this logic, are often, therefore,\nsymptoms of physics problems. Moreover, there may well be\nvery practical consequences with regard to eventual applications derived from self consistent interpretations.\n\nII. IRREALITY\n\nIrreal wave functions are of the form:\n\u03c8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c6(r1 , r2 ) + \u03c7(r1, r2 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c8(r1 , r2 ) represents a wave function for a combined\nsystem of subsystems, and both \u03c6(r1 , r2 ) and \u03c7(r1 , r2 ) are the\nwave functions for potential outcomes. Wave functions of this\nform are irreal if the summands are logically mutually exclusive, i.e., states that by all logic cannot exist simultaneously.\nThere is, in addition, a continuous variant of this same structure, in which, for example a point particle, which can be at\nonly one location at once, is represented by a wave packet\nfinite over several locations. All the conceptual features of irreality are evident, nevertheless, in the binary version as captured in Eq. (1); thus, let us focus on it.\nA prototypical example of a binary irreal wave function is\nthe singlet state used to describe the emission of correlated\nphoton pairs for an EPR experiment:\n1\n\u03c8(1, 2) = \u221a (\u03c81 S(\u2191)\u03c82 S(\u2192) \u2212 \u03c81S(\u2192)\u03c82 S(\u2191)),\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the system's state is supposed to be the difference of\npermutations of polarised photon pairs. Since each pair can\nhave one or the other orientation-combination at a time, the\n\n\f2\nsummands are logically mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, according to the 'Copenhagen' interpretation, this combination\nstate is considered the 'real' ontological state of the system\nuntil measurement 'collapses' this wave function to one or\nthe other 'non irreal' summand-as must happen since irreal\nstates are never actually observed in experiments.\nIrreality of wave functions is nowadays of relatively low\nconcern; an explanation of a possible reason for this should\nemerge below. In part, this is due to the fact that in many cases\nthe summands are not mutually exclusive and the wave function exhibits simple, and non problematic, 'superposition.'\nA natural question here is: just how did this situation arise;\nwhat reasoning lead to accepting such an extraordinary supposition? What problems brought this reasoning about? To\nthis writer it appears that the answer should be found exactly there, where the first appearance of wave functions of\nthe form of Eq. (1) arose in the literature. Almost certainly,\nit is in H EISENBERG's initial treatment of the two electron\natom, helium.[1]\nHis initial efforts to solve this problem were aimed primarily at getting a useful answer for spectroscopy and only\nincidentally at developing and promulgating his preferred\nparadigm. As a 'test bed' for developing the appropriate\nformalism, H EISENBERG chose the problem of coupled harmonic oscillators.[1] This problem is parallel to the problem\nof the helium atom in that each electron is primarily influenced by the nucleus and only secondarily by the other electron, analogously to oscillators whose behaviour is primarily\ndetermined by the 'spring constant(s)' and secondarily by a\nrelatively weak coupling between the oscillators.\nH EISENBERG observed, that it is a characteristic feature of\natomic systems, that the components of which they are comprised, namely electrons, are identical and subject to identical\nforces. Therefore, in order to invest this feature in his 'test\nbed', he assumed the H AMILTONian to be of the form:\nH=\n\n1 2 m 2 2\n1 2 m 2 2\np + \u03c9 q1 +\np + \u03c9 q2 + m\u03baq1q2 ;\n2m 1 2\n2m 2 2\n\n(3)\n\ni.e., the frequencies and masses of the coupled oscillators are\ntaken to be identical. In Eq. (3), q1 , q2 denote the coordinates,\np1 , p2 the momenta, m and \u03c9 the mass and frequency respectively, and \u03ba the interaction constant. With help of the well\nknown transformations:\n1\n1\nq\u20321 = \u221a (q1 + q2), q\u20322 = \u221a (q1 \u2212 q2 ),\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nEq. (3) is transformed into the separated form:\nH=\n\n1 \u20322 m \u20322 \u20322\n1 \u20322 m \u20322\np 1 + \u03c91 +\np + \u03c92 q 2 ,\n2m\n2\n2m 2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n2\n\u20322\n2\n\u03c9\u20322\n1 = \u03c9 + \u03ba, \u03c92 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03ba.\n\n(6)\n\nIn other words, H separates into the sum of two oscillators,\nsuch that each corresponds to a \"normal mode\", in the technique long before developed by DANIEL B ERNOULLI. When\n\nonly the first mode, q\u20321 , is excited, then both masses oscillate\nin phase, and when only q\u20322 is excited, out of phase.\nThe energies according to QM for the combined system are\nthen give by the equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nw\u20322 h \u2032 1\n\u03c9\u20321 h \u2032 1\nn1 +\n+\nn2 +\n,\n(7)\nHn\u2032 ,n\u2032 =\n1 2\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\u03c0\n2\nwhere n\u20321 and n\u20322 are integers.\nIn his scheme, the solutions that H EISENBERG obtained are\nmatrix elements found using his version of QM. The solutions\nfrom Eq. (7) are, as is usually the case for normal coordinates,\nnot physically observable, but particular solutions of an abstract combined system. The observables are the inverses of\nEqs. (4). At this stage the solutions do not yet suffer irreality;\nindeed, the classical mechanical solutions present no philosophical problems. If the initial conditions are appropriate,\nthe system executes motion described by one of the normal\nmodes, otherwise, the solution is a secular oscillation of the\ntotal system energy between the two oscillators.\nObserving that, at the atomic scale it is not possible to\ndetermine the exact details of light absorption and emission, H EISENBERG asserted, not altogether cogently, that\nhe considered discontinuities more faithful to reality than\nS CHR \u00d6DINGER's continuous waves.[2] It is reasonably arguable, however, that actually he succumbed to sociological\npressure, as portrayed by F ORMAN, namely to conform to\nthe pervasive antideterministic philosophical proclivities prevailing in German academia following World War I.[3] Thus,\nwith scant underpinning, seemingly in order to accommodate\nthe Zeitgeist, he simply chose a paradigm involving intrinsic\nrandomness. This, H EISENBERG realized by supposing that\nthe solutions, in place of secular oscillation, exhibit random,\nspontaneous, secular-like jumping back and forth.\nInstantaneous jumping by itself, is not necessarily irreal;\nimplicitly there can be a hidden variable that specifies as a\nfunction of time just which electron is excited in the series of\njumps back and forth, that perhaps an extention of QM could\npredict. However, admitting this possibility would undermine\nthe sociological goal of discrediting determinism; and so, for\nwhatever reason, this possibility was rejected out of hand.\nThe explicit insinuation of the 'completion' assumption\ninto the paradigm, or the 'Copenhagen' interpretation, was\na complicated and turbid development, the history of which\nhas been analysed extensively by B ELLER.[4] Notably, VON\nN EUMANN took up the question of completion at the latest by\n1932. He proffered a demonstration to the effect that presuming the existence of hidden variables completing QM implied\nthat some existing quantum structure is objectively false.[5]\nAlthough this seemed to settle the question, it was quickly\nseen (but not widely heeded) that his argument contained irrelevant hypothetical inputs.[6] In general, both those supporting H EISENBERG's discontinuous and S CHR \u00d6DINGER's continuous paradigms seemed more eager than not to assume that\nquantum theory is complete. Presumably, this happened, to\nsome degree uncritically, as it satisfied the ambition of the\nparticipants to be creating a deep and fundamental new theory; and moreover, it did not clash with the prevailing cultural\n\n\f3\nbias.\nThe strictly logical consequence, the implicit paradox, of\nthis assumption, however, was not assiduously analysed until later after the renowned paper by E INSTEIN , P ODOL SKY and ROSEN (EPR).[7] It was only with the controversy\nevoked by their arguments that the consequences of 'completeness', became a generally acknowledged issue. For example, S CHR \u00d6DINGER reacted immediately with analysis of\nthe then current understanding of the meaning of QM in which\nhe introduced the term \"entanglement\" for that form of correlation attributed to irreal wave functions.[8] In his paper\non this matter there are no new quantum techniques introduced, just new terminology to facilitate deliberate analysis\nof the then just implicit connotations for the terms used discussing interpretations. This work, being overtly critical, was\nno doubt a contribution to the duel with H EISENBERG on\nthe relative merits of discontinuous (matrix) versus continuous wave paradigms. In it S CHR \u00d6DINGER embellished EPR's\nillustrative gedanken experiment to the now renowned and absurdly irreal live-dead \"cat paradox\".\nThe crucial point here is, if QM is complete, then there can\nbe no hidden variables to specify which excited state among\nthe constituents at any moment is ontologically valid, thereby\ngiving their sum this role. That is, then all components, even\nmutually exclusive options, are to be extant simultaneously,\neven when not verifiable by observation. In short, if QM is\ncomplete, then there must be irreal states!\n\nspeak, a life of its own, that is, irreality has slid into oblivion\nand usually not discussed as the raison d'\u00eatre for nonlocality\nIn any case, B ELL's final conclusion was that, because\nQM is ineluctably nonlocal, any insinuation of hidden variables to 'complete' it, cannot lead to a deeper formulation\nthat is 'local' and 'real'. In turn, however, B ELL's argument too has come under criticism, starting with E DWIN\nJAYNES ,[10], who parsed B ELL's encoding of locality and\nfound that it overlooked structure requiring BAYES ' formula\nfor conditional probabilities. This writer has taken up this\nline and extended it by working out explicit consequences of\nJAYNES' point for the experiments thought to verify B ELL's\nanalysis.[11; 12] That is, classical, local, realist models for\nall the generic forms of EPR-type experiments have been\ndeveloped which lead to calculations, based essentially on\nM ALUS ' Law, utterly devoid of irreality and nonlocality,\nyielding curves\n\u221a precisely mimicking data taken in EPR experiments, |2 2| and all. Since B ELL's theorem states in effect that such models do not exist, exhibiting them shows that\nB ELL's theorem is wrong or misunderstood.\nJAYNES' essential point is that whereas B ELL wrote the\njoint probability P(a, b) for a coincidence event in an EPR\nexperiment, where the measurement settings are a and b, and\n\u03bb represents the imputed \"hidden variables\", in the form:\nP(a, b) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)P(a, \u03bb)P(b, \u03bb),\n\n(8)\n\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)P(a|b, \u03bb)P(b|\u03bb),\n\n(9)\n\nhe should have written:\nIII. NONLOCALITY\n\nNonlocality was introduced as the cure for irreality. The\nfact that observations never (could!) reveal states that are\ncomprised of irreal sums of mutually exclusive options, implies, it was hypothesised, that measurement itself somehow \"collapses\" the ontological wave function to the 'postmeasurement wave function', that is, just one of the options\ncomprising the irreal, 'pre-measurement' wave function.1 Insofar as measurement of one of a correlated pair instantaneously collapses a wave function for the other, regardless of\nits separation, the process insinuates 'nonlocality'.\nJ OHN B ELL in the 1950's, having rediscovered VON N EU MANN 's misstep and with inspiration from B OHMian mechanics, took up the issue with the goal of bringing it to an experimental nexus.[9] He did this with analysis subsequently, and\nstrictly incorrectly, labelled a \"theorem\", to the effect that locality demands that a certain statistic (Eq. (17) below) be\u221aless\nthan |2|. Experiments show, however, that it can reach |2 2|;\nand, nowadays the difference is taken to characterise \"stronger\nthan classical\" correlations which have become denoted \"entanglements\". In recent times this matter has taken on, so to\n\n1\n\nAlthough many early papers read as if their authors imagined wave 'collapse' upon measurement, VON N EUMANN appears to have been the first\nto have made the matter explicit.[5] The issue is confounded by the fact,\nthat measurement is to collapse simple superpositions also.\n\np(a, b) =\n\nZ\n\nwhere the latter form employs what is known as BAYES' formula or simply as the definition of conditional (versus absolute) probability.[14] Eq. (9), it can be easily verified, does\nnot admit deriving any form of the renowned \"B ELL inequalities\". What this means is that B ELL misencoded 'locality'\nas 'statistical independence', so that the observed violation\nof such inequalities in experiments cannot be interpreted to\nmean that nonlocal interaction or nonlocal correlation is in evidence. Rather, only, that the inequalities pertain when there\nis no correlations of any type, nonlocal or otherwise, contrary\nto EPR's, and subsequently to B ELL's, hypothesis and the\nexplicit design of experiments involving correlated pairs of\ninputs.\nSince this matter has been explicated in detail elsewhere,\n[11; 12; 13], here only one variant of several counter arguments shall be featured. Its key idea is that if the physical\nmeaning of the terms in B ELL's extraction of his inequalities\nare carefully interpreted, it is seen that certain of them must\nbe zero, thereby leading to a form of these inequalities for\nwhich there is no significance with regard to his sought after\nconclusion. This counter argument, which is independent of\nJAYNES ' criticism, but based on the same structure, proceeds\nas follows:\nFirst, recall a mathematical technicality concerning the\nproduct of two Dirac delta functions, which is essential for\nwhat follows. It is that the integral of the product of two delta\nfunctions for which the arguments are different, equals zero;\n\n\f4\ni.e.:\nZ\n\ndx f (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 l)\u03b4(x \u2212 m) = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nity', so argues B ELL, cannot depend instantaneously on remote conditions, such as the settings of the other polariser. In\naddition, each, by definition, satisfies\n\nwhenever l 6= m.\nThe derivation of a Bell Inequality starts from B ELL's fundamental assertion:\nP(a, b) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)A(a, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere, per explicit assumption: A is not a function of b; nor\nB of a; and each represents the appearance of a photoelectron\nin its wing of an EPR experiment, and a and b are the corresponding polariser filter settings.2 This is motivated on the\ngrounds that a measurement at station A, if it respects 'local-\n\n|A| \u2264 1, |B| \u2264 1,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich in this case effectively restricts the analysis to the case\nof just one photoelectron per time window per detector. Eq.\n(11) encodes the condition, that when the hidden variables are\naveraged out, the usual results from QM are to be recovered.\nThe \u03bb above in B ELL's analysis stands for a hypothetical\nset of \"hidden variables\", which, if they exist, should render\nQM deterministic. This set may include many different types\nof variables, such as discrete, continuous, tensor or whatever.\n\nExtraction of inequalities proceeds by considering differences of two such correlations where (a, b), i.e., the polariser axis of\nmeasuring stations, left and right, differ:\nP(a, b) \u2212 P(a, b\u2032 ) = d\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)[A(a, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb) \u2212 A(a, \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb)],\n\n(13)\n\nA(a, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb)A(a\u2032 , \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb) \u2212 A(a, \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb)A(a\u2032 , \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb) = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nR\n\nto which zero in the form:\n\nis added to get:\nP(a, b) \u2212 P(a, b\u2032 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)A(a, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb)[1 \u00b1 A(a\u2032, \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb)] \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)A(a, \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb)[1 \u00b1 A(a\u2032, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb)],\n\n(15)\n\nwhich, in turn, upon taking absolute values and in view of Eqs. (12), B ELL wrote as:\n|P(a, b) \u2212 P(a, b\u2032 )| \u2264 d\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)[1 \u00b1 A(a\u2032, \u03bb)B(b\u2032 , \u03bb)] + d\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb)[1 \u00b1 A(a\u2032, \u03bb)B(b, \u03bb)].\nR\n\nR\n\n(16)\n\nThen, using Eq. (11), and the normalisation condition d\u03bb \u03c1(\u03bb) = 1, he got, for example:\nR\n\n|P(a, b) \u2212 P(a, b\u2032 )| + |P(a\u2032 , b\u2032 ) + P(a\u2032, b)| \u2264 2,\n\n(17)\n\na 'Bell inequality'.\nNow, however, if the \u03bb are a complete set 2,3 , thereby\nrendering everything deterministic so that all probabilities as\nfunctions of \u03bb become Dirac or Kronecker delta distributions,\nthen the A's and B's in Eq. (15) are pair-wise; that is to say\nas individual events comprising the generation at the source of\none pair, are non zero for distinct values of \u03bb, which, by virtue\nof completeness, do not coincide for distinct events, i.e., for\n\ndifferent pairs. That is, for each pair of settings (a = r, b = s)\nand iteration of the experiment, n, there exists a unique set\nof values, \u03bba=r, b=s(n = integer), or in more compact notation, \u03bb(n), say, for which A(a|\u03bb(n))B(b|\u03bb(n)) is non-zero (1\nin the discrete case, \u221e in the continuous case). In other words,\neach product A(a|\u03bb(n))B(b|\u03bb(n)) can be written in the form\nf (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb(n)), so that all quadruple products, e.g.,\nA(a|\u03bb(n))B(b|\u03bb(n))A(a|\u03bb(m))B(b|\u03bb(m)),\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(18)\n\nare equivalent to the form:\nB ELL's notation, e.g., P(a,\u03bb), makes no distinction between variables, here\na, and conditioning parameters, here \u03bb, customarily separated by a vertical\nbar rather than a comma. This oversight is the source of much confusion,\nand possibly even the subliminal cause of his 'error'. In this paper, Bell's\nnotation is retained whenever referring directly to his formulas.\nB ELL used a single symbol: \u03bb, to denote what could be a complicated set\nof variables of possibly different types even. Thus, a \"particular values for\n\u03bb\" means that each entity in the whole set must have a value.\n\nf (x)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb(n))g(x)\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb(m)),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere x is a dummy variable of integration to run over all admissible values of \u03bb. Therefore, such terms with pair-wise\ndifferent values of \u03bb(n) in Eq. (15), i.e., whenever n 6= m ,\nare, in accord with Eq. (10), identically zero under integration over \u03bb. This annihilates two terms on the right side of\n\n\f5\nEq. (15), so that the final form of this Bell Inequality is then\nactually the trivial identity:\n|P(a, b)| + |P(a\u2032, b\u2032 )| \u2264 2.\n\n(20)\n\nThus, our final conclusion is, that the proof of the ineluctability of the presence of nonlocality in QM, is invalid.\nIn the context of what is actually a further point regarding the\nadmissibility of additional, ostensibly still 'hidden' variable\ncompletions of QM, this conclusion undermines the popular\nimpression that such a 'completion' necessarily cannot reinstate 'reality' and 'locality.'4\n\nIV. BOHM'S VERSION OF EPR EXPERIMENTS\n\nEPR proposed a gedanken experiment involving the disintegration of a mother particle into two daughters moving off in\nopposite directions.[7] They observed that quantum principles\nstate that H AMILTONian conjugate variables suffer H EISEN BERG uncertainty, and therefore, cannot be simultaneously\ndetermined exactly. But, in the situation envisioned by EPR,\nthe experimenter could observe one daughter's position to arbitrarily high precision, while observing to arbitrarily high\nprecision the other daughter's momentum; and, then, calling\non symmetry, one could specify to arbitrary high precision\nall four quantities-in conflict with H EISENBERG's Principle.\nHence, the paradox.\nComplicating matters, actually doing the EPR experiment\nas proposed, is impractical. So, as is well known, B OHM\nproposed another venue, now called \"qubit\" space.[16] Originally he considered using particles with spin; but, this venue\ntoo was impractical, so experimenters chose spin's homeomorphic partner: light polarisation space. This change of\nvenue, however, introduces two serious defects. One, the two\nstates of polarisation, in spite of not commuting (for purely\ngeometric reasons it turns out), are not H AMILTONian conjugate pairs; the structure involved in not intrinsic to QM,\nbut just to classical electrodynamics. Two, the two polarisation states are non interacting; the structure leading to 'irreal'\nstates as the sum of two mutually contradictory summands, is\nnot relevant. Appropriate states for emissions of polarisation\ncorrelated daughter signals can be expressed without use of\nthe 'irreal' format. In conclusion, even disregarding JAYNES '\nchallenge to their general validity, various hypothetical inputs\ninto the logic of the derivation of B ELL inequalities have not\nbeen met by optical experiments widely credited with \"proving B ELL's theorem\".5\n\nV. SUMMARY AND FORECAST\n\nHerein, history has been, so to say, \"rewritten\" so as to\nparse better the logical interrelationships among the features\nconstraining development of an interpretation for QM. The\nconcluding point here is that the assumption that quantum\ntheory is \"complete\" compelled the introduction of the notions of 'irreality' and 'nonlocality'. That the assumption\nof 'completeness' is the source of conflicted logic is by far\nnot here unique; P OST has argued convincingly already for\ndecades, on the basis of detailed analysis of numerous specific \"quantum\" phenomena, that this assumption introduces\nserious lacuna.[18]\nUnfortunately, simply rejecting the completeness assumption alone does not render the matter clear. QM captures\nan undulatory feature even deeper than the structure involving the statistics of ensembles of atomic scale entities;\nthis requires a physical nature for 'wave functions'; despite\nS CHR \u00d6DINGER's failure to find it, they cannot simply be just\nprogenitors of statistical densities. A full remedy must be\nfound elsewhere.6\nIndependently and additionally, I argue in support of\nJAYNES , that B ELL's analysis stemming from the EPR arguments in favour of the incompleteness of QM, contains an error.\nBeyond the philosophical (or accompanying mathematical)\nimplications of revamping the nowadays customary understanding of this issue in terms of \"entanglement\", there is a\npossible solidly practical consequence. It follows from the\nfact that the physical manifestations of entanglement targeted\nfor exploitation, all depend in the end on the consequences\nof superposition resulting from the linearity of the hyperbolic\ndifferential equation underpinning QM, i.e., S CHR \u00d6DINGER's\nequation. Since this hyperbolic structure is not an exclusive\nconsequence of any quantum feature, certain applications now\nthought to require atomic scale realization, 'quantum logic\ngates' for example, may in fact not need micro devices to run\nwhat are thought to be 'quantum algorithms'. As manufacturing macroscopic devices is much easier, a computer realizing\nthe parallelism of what turns out to be implicit in all F OURIER\nanalysis, not just from 'quantum entanglement', might be eminently obtainable.7\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Heisenberg, W., Z.
