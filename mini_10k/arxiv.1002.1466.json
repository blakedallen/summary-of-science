Introduction\nThe notion that carriers doped into insulators get dressed by lattice deformations has\nbeen around for a long time[1, 2]. A recent development is that this polaron formation\ncan be studied experimentally using ARPES yielding more direct information on the\nphysics than classical transport and optical spectroscopic methods. Especially when the\ncarrier density is small but finite, where a controlled theoretical framework is lacking,\nARPES has been quite revealing. The case has been made that lightly doped cuprates\nfall victim to small polaron formation (strong interacting case) that is vulnerable to\nself trapping by impurities [3, 4]: in undoped cuprates the spectral functions reveal\nFrank-Condon type broad humps caused by the coupling to multiple phonons, and only\nwhen doping is increased, a well-defined quasi-particle (QP) peak starts to emerge [3, 4].\nAnother recent ARPES revelation is found in the context of highly doped manganites\nin the colossal magneto resistance regime. At high temperatures ARPES reveals the\nFrank-Condon humps signaling small polarons, while upon lowering temperature small\npole-strength quasiparticle peaks appear in addition, indicating that a coherent Fermiliquid is formed from the microscopic polarons[5].\nBoth manganites and cuprates are doped Mott-insulators and no modern ARPES\ninformation is available on polaron physics in the simpler doped band insulators. We\ntherefore decided to focus on the classic SrTiO3 doped band insulator. SrTiO3 is known\nto have an exceptionally high static dielectric constant on the order of 104 at low\ntemperature [6]. Superconductivity can be induced by electron doping with either O,\nNb, or La[7, 8] over a narrow range of low carrier concentrations between \u223c 1019 to\n\u223c 1020 cm\u22123 . The optimal Tc is typically 0.2-0.3 K but can reach up to 1.2 K[9] which\nis surprisingly high for such low carrier concentrations. It has been speculated that this\nis due to the formation of bipolarons[10]. However, whether large or small polarons\nactually exist in SrTiO3 depends on the relevant length scale for the electron-phonon\ncouplings.\nThe case was made in a recent optical study by van Mechelen et al. that the\nelectron-phonon coupling is actually not very strong[11]. ARPES is however more direct\nin revealing the strength of the coupling to specific phonons. With this technique we\narrive at the conclusion that small polarons are not formed in STO and that the electronphonon coupling acts in a perturbative way.\n2. Methods and Materials\nThe samples investigated here are Lax Sr1\u2212x TiO3+\u03b4 (Crystal Base Co., Japan) at nominal\ndopings of x = 0.01 (Tc \u223c 0.2 K) and x = 0.05 (non superconducting) [8] while the\nactual doping levels at the surface are slightly different due to oxygen vacancies. We\nobtain high-quality surfaces by cleaving along guiding lines at T = 10 K and measure at\nthe same temperature. This new technique results in significantly flatter surfaces than\nfracturing or scraping of SrTiO3 . This was found to substantially improve the quality of\n\n\fStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\n4\n\nARPES data and enable us to see a clear quasi-particle band dispersion and dispersion\nanomaly which have not been seen in previous measurements[12, 13, 14]\nARPES data were collected on a Scienta-4000 analyzer at the Stanford Synchrotron\nRadiation Laboratory (SSRL), Beamline 5-4, and the Advanced Light Source (ALS),\nBeamline 10.0.1, with photon energies between 18-90 eV and a base pressure of\n< 4\u00d710\u221211 torr. Samples were cleaved in situ along the (001) plane at the measurement\ntemperature, T = 10 K. A sharp (1 \u00d7 1) low-energy-electron-diffraction pattern indicates\na well-ordered surface devoid of any reconstructions. The energy resolution was set to 911 meV and 15-20 meV for 18-35 eV and 35-90 eV photon energies respectively and the\nangular resolution was 0.35\u25e6. Additionally, a LSCO sample with x=0.01 was measured\nat ALS with photon energy = 55eV and T = 20K.\n3. Results\nIn Fig. 1, we present ARPES data taken at a photon energy of 27 eV. The dominant\nfeatures in the angle integrated spectrum are the valence band between 3.3 eV and 9\neV, an in-gap state near 1.3 eV and the QP peak at the Fermi level. The energy gap\nbetween the onset of the oxygen valence bands to the QP band bottom is around 3.3\neV consistent with optical measurements[15] while local-density-approximation (LDA)\nband structure calculations predict a gap of \u223c 2 eV[14, 16]. The presence of a nondispersive and broad in-gap state around 1.3 eV has been discussed in the literature\n(Ref. [13] and refs. therein) as caused by a local screening effect, chemical disorder or\ndonor levels.\nHaving established the basic spectral features, we now focus on the Fermi surface\ntopography of SrTiO3 . Fig. 2(a)-2(d) show ARPES data taken at various photon\nenergies (changing kz ) together with a Fermi surface map at 27 eV, projected on the\nkx -ky plane (Fig. 2(e)). The flatter band with a \u223c60 meV band bottom (i.e. in\nFig. 2(a)-2(c)) corresponds to a bulk state since the kF crossing changes with different\nphoton energy (changing kz ), in agreement with LDA calculations by I.I. Mazin where\nthe computational details are the same as in Ref. [11]. The steeper band with a bottom\n\u223c200 meV (e.g. in Fig. 2(d)) can be attributed to the surface of cleaved SrTiO3\nbecause the data do not show noticeable dispersion along kz and they are absent in\nLDA calculations (indicated by blue line and surface in Fig. 2(e) and 2(f)). Since the\nsurface band crosses the bulk band, it cannot be an eigenstate of the system but possibly\na surface resonance state; this surface state is investigated further in smaller doping,\nx=0.001 samples [17]. We also note that in x = 0.01 samples a second bulk band is\nexpected with a Fermi crossing near the surface band. However, this band appears to\nbe overshadowed by the more intense surface related band and further suppressed by\nthe matrix element near \u0393 point. In the following, we will use the schematic contours\nof the kF positions, indicated by green surfaces in Fig. 2(f), to describe the bulk Fermi\nsurface.\nFig. 3(a) and 3(b) show the occupied bands, along the \u0393X direction in the vicinity\n\n\fStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.

The inset shows angle-resolved data of the\nin-gap state around 1.3 eV. (b) Quasi-particle band dispersion in the (010) plane near\nEF (see cut b in Fig. 2(f) ) with corresponding energy distribution curves in (c).\n\nof the \u0393 point of the x = 0.01 and 0.05 samples. By aligning the kF 's of the ARPES\ndata with those of the LDA dispersions[11], we estimate the dopings of the x = 0.01 and\nx = 0.05 samples to be slightly higher than the nominal dopings (1.5\u00b10.2% and 5.6\u00b10.5\n%, respectively: Fig. 3(e)), likely due to a small oxygen deficiency at the surface.\nHaving isolated the occupied part of the conduction bands (Fig. 3(a)-3(d)), let us\nnow turn to the interpretation of the data. In the data one can discern a weak kink\nin the dispersion at approximately 20 meV binding energy (blue arrows, Fig. 3(a) and\n3(b)). This is more clear in the x = 0.01 sample, since in the x=0.05 sample it resides\nin a region where the dispersion has a strong curvature (Fig. 3(e)). Such a weak kink\nstructure in the dispersion indicates a perturbative coupling with a bosonic mode at this\nenergy. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the intensity rapidly\nincreases below the kink energy; above the kink energy, an extra decay channel opens\nup that will smear the QP peak. To quantify the coupling to this boson, we extracted\n\n\fStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\n6\n\nFigure 2. Fermi surface topography of SrTiO3 . (a) - (d) Band dispersion in the (010)\nplane for photon energies of 19, 24, 27 and 29 eV, respectively. Doped SrTiO3 has a\ncubic unit cell and a three-dimensional Fermi surface, consisting of three ellipsoid-like\nsurfaces along each axis (see more detail in Ref. [14]); when including the spin orbit\ncoupling term in calculation [11], a shift in the Fermi surface occurs as shown in Fig.\n3(e). (e) Fermi surface map near the Brillouin zone mid-plane (h\u03bd =27eV). The solid\ngreen lines are guides to the eye. Estimated kz positions for (a)-(d) are indicated by\nthe orange lines in the schematic Fermi surface (f), where half of the whole Fermi\nsurface is plotted; green (blue) indicates bulk (surface) band. Note that in x = 0.01\nsamples a second bulk band is expected with a Fermi crossing near the surface band.\nHowever, this band appears to be overshadowed by the more intense surface related\nband and further suppressed by the matrix element near \u0393 point.\n\nthe band velocities for the x = 0.01 case at binding energies below (vlo ) and above\n(vhi ) the kink energy (see Fig. 3(f)) to be \u223c0.16 eV\u00c5 and 0.21 eV\u00c5, respectively. The\nmass renormalization is therefore vhi /vlo = m\u2217 /m \u223c1.3, indicating a coupling to this\nparticular boson \u03bb\u2032 \u2261 m\u2217 /m \u2212 1 = 0.3.\nGiven that the signals are rather smeared at higher energies we cannot exclude the\npresence of other kinks associated with higher energy modes. However, the data permit\nus to track the overall width of the occupied parts of the conduction bands. For the\nx = 0.01 sample we find the band bottom at \u223c58 meV whereas the LDA calculation\nindicates it to be at \u223c97 meV [11] (Fig. 3(e)). It follows that the overall width of\nthe occupied band is renormalized by a factor of \u223c1.7 (WLDA /Wexp ).

Cross\nsymbols indicate peaks from energy distribution curves (EDC) and dashed lines are\nextrapolated to get the band bottom. The most prominent kink energy is indicated\nby arrows around \u223c 20meV for both doped samples. Possibly, there is a second kink\nin the x=0.05 sample between 40-60 meV but the complication from the side band\nmakes it less clear. Note that kz varies slightly along the k-axis of (a) and (b) (see\nFig. 2). However, this change has only a minute influence on the measured group\nvelocities and will be neglected for the discussion of the mass renormalization.

(f) Schematic plot of\nrenormalized band dispersion in the forms of \"kink\" and reduced bandwidth caused\nby phonons whose mode energies are lower and higher than the electron bandwidth,\nrespectively.\n\nrenormalization is the product of the bandwidth and kink renormalization factors and\nwe find this to be 1.7 \u00d7 1.3 \u2243 2.2 in the x = 0.01 sample, close to the estimate 2-3\ndeduced from the optical measurements[11].\nTo compare with STO data, Fig. 4 shows ARPES data of La1\u2212x Srx CuO4 with\nx=0.01, as a lightly doped Mott insulator. The momentum is along the (0,0) to (\u03c0, \u03c0)\ndirection. We note that all the data in Fig. 4 are already subtracted by the nondispersive background of oxygen valance band for clearer comparison. In contrast to\nSTO, the spectrum (see red line in Fig. 4(b)) shows a small quasi-particle peak with\nlarge Frank-Condon type broad hump around 400 meV - a signature of small polaron\n\n\fStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\n8\n\nformation. LSCO data also shows a clear kink in the dispersion, indicating a strong\nelectron-phonon coupling at around 70 meV (see arrow in Fig. 4(a)); to quantify this\ncoupling, we extracted the band velocities at binding energies below (vlo ) and above\n(vhi ) the kink energy to be \u223c1.66 eV\u00c5 and 6.14 eV\u00c5, respectively. Therefore, the\nmass renormalization factor from this kink feature is vhi /vlo = m\u2217 /m \u223c3.7. A use of\n\u03bb\u2032 \u2261 m\u2217 /m \u2212 1 would give \u03bb\u2032 of 2.7, giving a clear contrast to the extracted value of\n\u223c0.3 from the kink feature of the x=0.01 STO sample.\n\nFigure 4.

Discussion and Conclusion\nHow to interpret these findings from STO data? The 20 meV kink is certainly related\nto a phonon. A-priori one can be less certain about the cause of overall bandwidth\nrenormalization because an electronic origin cannot be excluded. However, although\nLDA is well known to underestimate band gaps in band-insulators, it does not usually\nunderestimate the bandwidths and our extracted renormalization factor may be regarded\nas an upper value. At the same time, the phonon dispersions of STO have been measured\nby infrared and Raman spectroscopy[15] and neutron scattering[18, 19, 20, 21] in great\ndetail; the phonon modes are in the range of 0-100 meV where much of the phonon\nspectrum extends to energies that are larger than the Fermi energy of at least the\nx = 0.01 system. Under such an anti-adiabatic condition, one expects the electronphonon coupling to give rise to an overall bandwidth renormalization that can be\nestimated from the mass-renormalization formulae for the isolated polaron [1]. Since\nthe focus here is on the surprisingly moderate el-ph coupling, we attribute all the\nrenormalization to el-ph interaction which sets the upper bound for the value of \u03bb \u223c 1.\nAn overall coupling \u03bb \u223c 1 can mean both that small, self-trapped polarons are formed\nbut also that the system stays itinerant. What decides the nomenclature is the length\nscale of the relevant electron-phonon couplings.\nWhen the el-ph coupling is short ranged, small polarons are expected. One can\ntake the cuprates as an example where an effective \u03bb \u2243 1 corrected for electronic band\nnarrowing effects [22] that enhance the impact of el-ph interaction is believed to be\nresponsible for the multi-phonon Franck-Condon peak indicated in Fig. 4(c). Here we\nshould note that m* is no longer linear with \u03bb and increases rapidly near the small-tolarge polaron crossover around \u03bb \u2243 1. For \u03bb \u2243 1 in cuprates (e.g. in the case of LSCO\nshown in Fig. 4), the actual face value of mass renormalization could be as large as 3.7;\nhence, \u03bb\u2032 defined by m\u2217 /m \u2212 1 would be 2.7.\nThe most striking aspect of the STO data is that such effects due to small-polaron\nformation are entirely absent in STO, where instead the electrons remain strongly\ncoherent as manifested by the strong energy-momentum dispersion and the rather sharp\nQP peaks with large pole strengths even for 1% doped sample (Fig. 4(c)). This\ncan be reconciled with the relatively large \u03bb assuming that the dominating electronphonon couplings are of the long ranged, polar kind [23]. This claim can in fact be\nfurther substantiated by the finding that our data are in semi-quantitative agreement\nwith 'naive' continuum limit estimations of the polar el-ph interactions[24, 10]. In\nthis way only the long ranged electrostatic interactions are taken into account with\nthe longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, omitting completely short range interactions\ninvolving the transversal optical (TO) phonons that are in reality always present.\nStarting from this perspective, let us first discuss why the large bulk dielectric\nconstant may not be a good indicator for formation of small polaron. The dielectric\nconstants at zero frequency (\u03b50 ) and at frequencies large compared to the phonon energy\n(\u03b5\u221e ) are related to the frequencies of LO and TO phonons as \u03b50 /\u03b5\u221e = \u03a0a (\u03c9aLO /\u03c9aT O )2\n\n\f10\n\nStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\nwhere a specifies the phonon branch. A large \u03b50 signals a softening of the TO phonon\nthat eventually can condense in a ferroelectric state. However, the Fr\u00f6hlich polar elph interactions involve the LO phonons where the large \u03b50 will also help the coupling\nstrength but with smaller effect. The coupling strength depends on the dielectric term\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03ba\u22121 = \u03b5\u22121\n\u223c 0.17 in La2 CuO4\n\u221e \u2212 \u03b50 which increases slightly upon increase of \u03b50 (\u03ba\nand \u223c 0.19 in STO) [25]. Another issue is that the short-range coupling to this TO\nphonon could be enhanced due to the softening of the frequency \u03c9T O . However, since\nthe softening occurs only in a narrow region in momentum space characterized by the\nscale a/\u03be \u223c\n= 0.1 (\u03be: correlation length) [19, 20], the increase in the coupling constant \u2206\u03bb\nof the order of \u2206\u03bb \u223c\n= \u03bb(\u03c9T0 O /\u03c9T O )2 (a/\u03be)3 is small.\nTable 1.

Using that, for weak coupling,\n\u03bbi = \u03b1i /6 [1, 26] this translates into \u03bbi 's of 0.003, 0.16 and 0.6 respectively. These\nmodes are indicated together with the electronic dispersions in the schematic Fig. 3(f).\nThe low energy kink in the electron dispersions matches very well with the 22 meV\nmode associated with Sr-O bond stretching [21]. The other two phonon modes are\nat higher energy than the band bottom and hence they should cause an overall band\nwidth reduction. For an accurate treatment, one may consider the anti-adiabatic limit;\nhowever from the available calculation, the coupling constants \u03b1 of these 58-meV and\n99-meV modes will give a bandwidth-renormalized factor of 1.76, which is already very\nclose to our extracted value of \u223c1.7. The polar el-ph calculation strongly underestimates\nthe \u03bb\u2032 \u2243 0.3 coupling to the 22 meV phonon. The main coupling from this Sr-O bond\nstretching modes comes from large momenta near the zone boundary as in the cuprates\n\n\fStrong energy-momentum dispersion in the lightly doped SrTiO3\n\n11\n\nand is expected from general grounds due to the displacement eigenvectors. Thus, it\nis a local deformation. As we discussed in the previous paragraph this could well be\nsignificantly enhanced by the proximity to the ferroelectric transition, a reason why its\nmain impact is only on the low energy phonon. However, given that the coupling is still\nmoderate and this phonon is of the adiabatic/Eliashberg kind, it does not interfere with\nthe consistency of our argument.\nWhile small polarons are absent in STO, the cuprates at similar doping show a\nsharp contrast in displaying strong el-ph coupling with mass renormalization as large\nas 3.7 (see Table 1 for the comparison between LSCO and SrTiO3 ). For the following\nreasons, the carriers doped into a Mott insulator can be subject to a stronger short-range\nel-ph interaction. One is that the additional polaronic effect due to the magnetic degrees\nof freedom enhances the effective mass, and hence collaborate to form the composite\nsmall polaron with magnon and phonon clouds[29]. Another reason is that fluctuations\nwith large momentum (e.g. k=(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) of the antiferromagnetic state in the cuprates)\nare involved in dressing the doped carriers. Starting from the Fr\u00f6hlich interaction, the\nexchange of this large momentum can lead to the short-range el-ph interaction. In\nthe case of a band insulator, the large momentum in this same order of magnitude is\nnot immediately available. Therefore, small polaron formation is more likely to occur\nin a Mott insulator than in a band insulator. We should note that there could be\nan additional advantage in anisotropic layer compounds that electron-phonon coupling\nalong perpendicular axis is little screened and hence remains strong[30, 31]. However, it\nis also known in cuprates that the small polaron effect disappears largely upon doping\naway from the antiferromagnetism (e.g. Nax Ca2\u2212x CuO2 Cl2 with x=0.12 [3]) where the\nconductivity is still very anisotropic. Therefore, it is likely that there are also other\nphysics (e.g. as discussed above) in helping the formation of small polaron.\nIn conclusion, we have shown the quite unexpected results that there is little\nevidence for small polaron formation in lightly doped SrTiO3 indicating that the large\ndielectric behavior can occur independently of strong el-ph interactions. In turn, this\nindicates that in doped Mott insulators like the cuprates, the dressing of electrons by\nspin excitations [22, 29] and strong correlations conspire to give a short-range el-ph\ninteraction able to trap doped carriers and more readily form polarons.\n5.
