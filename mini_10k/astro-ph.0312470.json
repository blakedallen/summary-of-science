The spectroscopic model of accretion flows in\nblack hole binaries, circa 1973 (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev 1973).\n\nLOOKING BACKWARD\nThose who forget history are condemned to repeat it. \u2013\nGeorge Santayana\nThere are a number of reviews describing theoretical\nmodels and observations of galactic black hole candidate (GBHC) binaries [e.g., 1, 2]. It is interesting to look\nback, however, and note that many of the components\nincorporated into models today had their origins some\ntime ago, with many important insights made using very\nsparse data. Some ideas have come into and out of consideration several times over the past thirty years. See\n[2], for example, for a brief description of the history of\nthe fluorescent Fe line in GBHC, which has gone from\nbeing interpreted as broad to narrow, and back and forth\n\nagain, several times [3, 4, 5, 6, etc.]. I myself have been\non both sides of this issue [7, 8], although I am certainly\nnot alone in this regard [6, 9].\nThe seminal theoretical work that helped usher in the\n\"modern era\" of the study of accretion flows was that\nof Shakura & Sunyaev [10, see Fig. 1]. Theories, aided\nby observations, quickly added complexity to this basic picture. The concept of a two-phase flow (i.e., disk\nand 'corona') was introduced, and was even suggested\nto represent 'advection domination' [11, 12]. Disks were\nhypothesized to be warped [13], to produce magnetic\nflares in their inner regions [14], or to be surrounded\nby a hot corona that produced the characteristic spectrum of 'hard state' observations [15]. Very brief, fastphotometry optical observations [16] revived the concept\nof disk flares, and tied them to optical synchrotron emission [17]. Magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence was suggested as the viscous dissipation mechanism [18], and\nlater even suggested to be acting within the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) [19].\nA major observational advance was made when radio\njets were discovered in X-ray binaries [20]. It is interesting to note, however, that 'radio jet ejection events'\npreviously had been hypothesized, probably correctly so,\nbased solely upon 'dipping events' in X-ray observations\nof GX 339\u22124 [21]. Meanwhile, the study of warped\n\n\fFIGURE 2. The spectroscopic model of accretion flows in\nblack hole binaries, circa 2003. It is now widely believed that\n(starting from the outer disk, and working our way inward, then\nalong the axis and upward) that the accretion flow consists of:\na warped disk, with disk wind; MHD turbulence providing the\nviscosity; magnetic flaring activity and/or a corona; dissipation\nfrom the region interior to the innermost stable circular orbit;\nan outward propagating jet yielding radio and possibly X-ray\nemission; and the interaction of this jet with the surrounding\ninterstellar medium.\n\ndisks had been revived [22], and advection dominated\nflows had undergone several revivals [23, 24] and further had winds, and several new acronyms, appended to\nthem [25]. In at least one instance [26], an X-ray binary\njet clear manifested itself in the X-ray due to its interaction with the interstellar medium. It also has been suggested, however, that steady jets in the hard state can\nsignificantly contribute to the observed 2-200 keV X-ray\nspectrum [27].\nThis past 30 years of research has led to a picture much\nas presented in Fig. 2. My own reading of our field is that\nmost of us would agree that all the components shown\nin Fig. 2 are relevant. The major questions, then, relate\nnot to the existence of these components, but rather to\ntheir relative contributions to the observed spectra (and\nvariability) from source to source, and, within a given\nsource, as a function of the source luminosity, 'state',\nand history. Ultimately, our goal is to tie these phenomena to basic system parameters (black hole mass, spin,\naccretion rate onto the hole, secondary mass, binary separation, etc.), and use them to study General Relativity\nin the strong field regime [e.g., 28] and plasma physics\nunder extreme conditions.\n\ncurrently operating instruments that are in many ways\ncomplementary to one another. Using various combinations, one can obtain spectra in the 0.1\u2013600 keV regime,\n(continuous) timing ranging from \u03bc sec to 100's of ksec\n(and 10's of Msec, if one includes the RXTE -ASM ),\nand spectral resolutions as large as E/\u2206E \u2248 1000. Coordinated multiple X-ray satellite observations are now\nroutinely performed. For example, RXTE provides the\nbroad band spectrum while, Chandra allows the Fe line\nregion to be decomposed into broad and narrow components [e.g., 29].\nIn Fig. 3, I show joint RXTE -INTEGRAL observations of Cyg X-1 [30], which provides an extremely\nbroad-band spectrum. These particular spectra are very\nwell fit by a low temperature, disk blackbody, Compton\nupscattered in an \u2248 100 keV corona with optical depth\n\u03c4es \u2248 1. The spectra are further reflected off of a cold,\nmildly ionized slab, with reflection fraction \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u2248 0.2.\nThere are plans to follow-up this particular observation in the Fall of 2004 with a multi-observatory campaign (PI: J. Wilms) that will consist of ground based radio and optical, along with simultaneous XMM-Newton,\nRXTE, and INTEGRAL observations. This will achieve\nthe broadest band spectrum of any GBHC to date.\nThis highlights a very important point about X-ray\nspectroscopy as currently practiced: it no longer solely\ndeals with X-ray spectra. Gamma-ray spectra are crucial\nfor constraining high energy cutoffs, which yield coronal\ntemperatures and are likely important for distinguishing\nbetween X-ray emission from jets and coronae. Radio\nspectra constrain models of the jets. IR and optical spectra constrain jet and outer-disk models. All these components are coupled observationally, and hence must be\ncoupled theoretically. One of RXTE 's greatest contributions to the study of X-ray spectra of GBHC has been\nto reveal the coupling of radio and X-ray emission. For\nexample, the low/hard state of GX 339\u22124 reveals that\nthe X-ray flux, FX , is related to the radio flux, Fr , by\nFX \u221d Fr1.4 [31]. It further has been suggested that this\ntrend may be universal in the hard state of GBHC [32].\nWhether one agrees or disagrees with the X-ray jet\nmodel of hard state GBHC [e.g. 27], it is worthwhile noting that prior to the launch of RXTE, few would have\never even attempted to apply a model (at least to GBHC,\nas opposed to AGN) that attempts to describe the spectrum over 9 orders of magnitude in photon energy. The\ndata simply did not exist. The extremely flexible scheduling of RXTE has allowed such multi-wavelength observations to be obtained far more readily. Furthermore,\nsuch observations have been carried out over multiple\nflux levels and spectral states1 , allowing the discovery\n\nTHE 'GOLDEN AGE'\nAs discussed in the abstract above, we are perhaps living\nin the \"Golden Age\" of X-ray spectroscopy, with four\n\n1\n\nThis points out another unique advantage of RXTE.

These are 'unfolded\nspectra', comprised of a disk component, a broad gaussian line at 6.4 keV, and a power law with exponential cut-off reflected from\nan ionized slab. In the regions of overlap, there is very good agreement between the RXTE instruments (PCA and HEXTE ), and\nthe INTEGRAL instruments (JEM-X and HEXTE ).\n\nof spectral correlations as described above [31, 32].\nAlong with broad-band flux and spectral correlations,\ncurrent RXTE observations have been highlighting correlations of these properties with variability features. In\nthe hard state, flux appears correlated with spectral hardness, which in turn appears correlated with peak frequencies of characteristic broad features in power spectra (PSD) of X-ray variability [e.g. 33, 34, 8] and with\nthe time lags between hard and soft X-ray variability\n[35, 8, 36]. These properties may further be correlated\nwith 'finer' spectral features, such as reflection fraction\n[37, 34, 8]. Again, these strong observational couplings\nindicate that there must be fundamental theoretical underpinnings. X-ray spectroscopy is (or at least, should\nbe) inseparable from X-ray variability studies.\n\nLOOKING FORWARD\nGreetings, my friends. We are all interested in the future,\nfor that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of\nour lives. And remember, my friends, future events such\nas these will affect you, in the future. \u2013 Criswell, 'Plan 9\nFrom Outer Space'\n\nThe Glass is (Mostly) Full\nWhere do we go from here, and are we well-prepared\nto get there? In the short-term, over the next two years,\nI believe that the answer is an emphatic yes. We will\n\nobservations. If a single observation allows one to study 'weather',\nRXTE has allowed us to study GBHC 'climates'.\n\nnot see any of our capabilities diminish (barring any unforeseen events that affect currently operating satellites),\nand we will see some very important new capabilities\nemerge. One of these capabilities that I personally am\nmost excited about is the advent of new IR and optical\nobservations of GBHC. Although the discovery of microquasars is nearly a decade old, dedicated radio/X-ray\nspectral campaigns are less than seven years old. The correlation of these properties with X-ray timing properties\nis even more recent. Extending such studies to the IR and\noptical regimes is likely to be very important.\nI foresee this progressing in two ways, both of which\nare underway now. First, there are dedicated, frequent\noptical observations of GBHC with small telescopes,\nsuch as recent optical observations of XTE J1550\u2212564\n[38]. Such observations can be correlated with the daily\nmonitoring by the RXTE -ASM, which will likely shed\nfurther light on the nature of GBHC state transitions.\nIR/optical studies can also provide needed information\nabout the transitions from the radio (jet?) to the X-ray\n(corona?) part of the spectrum. Specifically, we only\nhave limited observational knowledge of the IR turnover\nbetween these two spectral regimes [although see 39].\nSecond, the twenty year old suggestion that innerdisk flares create optical synchrotron emission [17] was\nbased upon only 100 seconds worth of data, where it was\nunclear whether the optical led or trailed, or was correlated or anti-correlated [16]! Observations with large\nmodern telescopes with fast photometry systems, such\nas the VLT, have dramatically improved this situation.\nVery exciting examples are the recent optical/X-ray observations of XTE J1118+480, where possibly correlated optical and X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO)\nare observed, and where it was further suggested that\nthe optical variability traces a synchrotron component of\nthe spectrum [40].

To a limited extent, XMM-Newton has the\npotential for replacing RXTE for studies of X-ray spectraltemporal correlations. Shown here is a simulation of the Cyg\nX-1 hard state spectrum observed in a proposed modification\nof the XMM-Newton \"timing mode\" (Wilms et al., in prep.).\nThe simulated spectrum is a reflected power law, plus broad and\nnarrow Fe line components, absent from the fit, with residuals\nshown above.\n\nspectral-temporal studies, these optical/X-ray studies are\nonly in their infancy. Again, however, they do rely on the\nfuture availability of a flexible, easily scheduled X-ray\nobservatory.\nSpectral-temporal X-ray studies will undoubtedly continue in the near term, especially with RXTE. But what\nabout the post-RXTE era? Chandra and the imminent\nAstro E II have somewhat reduced effective areas compared to RXTE, as well as potential problems with photon pile-up [e.g., 41] for sources as bright as many\nGBHC. XMM-Newton, although having good effective\narea, CCD resolution, and reasonably fast timing capability, has suffered from telemetry constraints for bright\nsources2 . A potential work-around for this situation may\noffer the possibility of dramatically improving the utility of XMM-Newton for GBHC spectral-temporal studies (Wilms et al., in prep.). In a suggested new mode,\nthe lower energy threshold will be raised to \u2248 2 keV,\nthereby reducing telemetry and allowing the use of 'timing mode'. If successful, this will allow RXTE -like timing with CCD spectral resolution (see Fig. 4 for a spectral simulation of Cyg X-1; courtesy J. Wilms). However, XMM-Newton still has fairly severe scheduling\nconstraints, and such a new mode will not be effective\nfor GBHC much brighter than Cyg X-1 (which numerous X-ray novae in outburst are).\n\n2\n\nThis has often required the use of the 'burst mode' for bright GBHC,\nwherein only \u2248 3% of the photons are telemetered to ground.\n\nFIGURE 5. A simulated 50 ksec Constellation-X observation of a quiescent black hole binary, such as XTE J1650-500.\nThe simulated model is a disk component, reflected power law,\nand broad line, but only the power law has been fit. Residuals\nclearly reveal the disk and broad line components of the spectrum.\n\nRegardless of the success of this proposed modified\nmode, in the near term XMM-Newton and Chandra both\nwill further our understanding of the X-ray spectra, and\nvariability, of quiescent GBHC. (This is provided that\nthese objects are studied with sufficiently long integration times; short observations are often limited to simple spectra, e.g. constrained power laws, and flux measurements.) One interesting recent GBHC observation\nis of the quiescent state of XTE J1650\u2212500 [42]. The\nobserved spectrum was hard, as is typical for 'low/hard\nstate' GBHC. Furthermore, the X-ray variability revealed\na break in the power spectrum at very low frequency,\nconsistent with previously observed trends for the characteristic PSD frequencies of hard state GBHC to decrease with decreasing flux. This is the first claim that\nthis trend continues into such extremely faint states.\nThis is one area where the farther future offers substantially greater promise. Current studies are limited\nby photon statistics of such faint sources. (For a given\nsignal-to-noise, the required integration times for PSD\nstudies scale as received count rate squared; see [43].)\nAn important attribute of Constellation-X (as well as\nXEUS, although here I do not show simulations of this\nlatter mission) is that with its proposed very large effective area, we simultaneously will obtain detailed Xray spectral and variability data from extremely faint\nsources. As an example, in Fig. 5 I present a simulation of a 50 ksec observation of a quiescent GBHC, such\nas XTE J1650\u2212500. Instead of simple power-law spectrum, I have included a disk blackbody and relativistic\nline, which are clearly revealed in the residual spectra\n\n\f0.010\n\n0.008\n\nf*PSD\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n\n0.000\n0.0001\n\n0.0010\n0.0100\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n0.1000\n\nFIGURE 6.

Fig. 6 shows\na simulated PSD that may be associated with the spectrum of Fig. 5. (The variability parameters are modeled\nafter the observations presented in [42].) Thus, by correlating such spectral features as the presence of a soft\ndisk component or broad line with characteristic variability features, we may determine whether these properties\ntruly are associated, for example, with a varying 'transition radius' between an outer thin disk and an inner\ncorona [see the reviews of 1, 2, and references therein].\n\nThe Glass is (a Little) Empty\nAs sketched out above, I am very optimistic about\ncurrent progress in the field, and about some of the new\ndirections that the field seems to be taking. But is there\nanything missing from our spectroscopic capabilities in\nthe future? And is there room for a replacement for\nRXTE ? My own opinion is that the answer to both\nquestions is 'yes'. Two of my major concerns for the\nfuture have been alluded to above. The first is that we\nhave become quite attached to the flexibility, ease of\n\n3\n\nThis simulation and figure are modeled after a similar presentation\nby Jon Miller at the Constellation-X Workshop held at Columbia\nUniversity, May 2003.\n\nscheduling, and the - still, in comparison to other Xray satellites - rapid maneuverability of RXTE, yet we\nhave no designated replacement.\nThe Swift X-ray/gamma-ray satellite will of course be\nflexible, rapidly maneuverable, and have broad energy\ncoverage with good timing capabilities. Understandably,\nhowever, the majority of its program will be devoted\nto its gamma-ray burst program, and we cannot reasonably expect it to supplant the current radio/optical/Xray multi-wavelength spectral programs conducted by\nRXTE. To a limited extent, Swift also will act as a replacement for the RXTE -ASM. Again, however, this replacement will be incomplete. The eventual loss of the\nASM will impact future XMM-Newton and Chandra observations in several ways.\nNot only will we no longer have a soft X-ray trigger for scheduling pointed spectral observations of rare\nevents, but we will also no longer have a long term\nlightcurve to act as context for pointed observations by\nother instruments. As alluded to above, the number of\nXMM-Newton or Chandra observations of any given\nGBHC is usually quite limited in comparison to available RXTE observations. Currently, these more limited\nobservations can be compared to spectral properties revealed by the ASM, which in turn often can be compared to more detailed pointed RXTE observations of the\nsame source at an earlier time with similar ASM spectral characteristics. (Currently, many radio/optical/X-ray\nstudies are conducted as monitoring programs utilizing\nthe ASM, e.g., [38, 39].) We very well may lose this ability well before the end of the mission lifetime of either\nXMM-Newton or Chandra.\nThe second concern that I have for future X-ray spectral studies is that we may be forgoing opportunities to\ndelve deeper into studies of spectral-temporal correlations. Further progress is partly contingent upon having\nthe ability to study rapid variability with a large effective\narea instrument. Specifically, the ability to study X-ray\nvariability phase information and coherence is severely\nlimited by photon statistics, even more so than are PSD\nstudies [43, 44].\nOne currently utilized method of studying spectraltemporal correlations is the so-called 'Fourier resolved\nspectroscopy' [34, 45] (although this technique has been\npreviously applied to Ginga observations of GBHC). Essentially, it involves weighting a spectrum by a PSD amplitude. One of my major objections to such techniques is\nthat they ignore phase information. For example, a pivoting power law appears as a broken spectrum, with the\nbreak at the pivot. Or another way of phrasing it, we\nare taking knowledge from an incoherent sum (the PSD),\nand applying that to something which is likely comprised\nof (quasi-)coherently added components (the spectrum).\nTechniques that go from the spectrum to an incoherently\nsummed PSD seem to me more promising.\n\n\fSuch thoughts, as with many of the theories discussed\nin the introduction, are of course not new, and have been\ncontemplated for prior X-ray observations of GBHC. For\nexample, using Ginga data, Miyamoto and collaborators\nhypothesized that GBHC variability was comprised of\n'disk' and 'coronal' components incoherently summed\n[46]. By first fitting the spectral component and then using the normalizations of the disk and coronal portions of\nthe spectrum, they found that a fair representation of the\nassociated PSD could be obtained. An incoherent sum\nfor the variability, however, is just the first approximation. Each component likely has its own phase (or, equivalently, lag between hard and soft variability) that can\nadd/interfere in the regions of strong overlap of the PSD\ncomponents.\nA potential example of such effects is shown in Fig. 7.\nThese PSD, phase lags, and coherence (i.e., normalized\namplitude of the cross-correlation; [44]) are composed\nfrom a set of (very similar) observations of GX 339\u22124\n[47]. The PSD is well modeled as a sum of broad features. It is possible that each of these broad features has\nits own intrinsic phase/time lag between hard and soft\nvariability (a hypothesized decomposition is shown in\nFig. 7), and that the net observed phase lag is the sum of\nthese components. Furthermore, one would expect drops\nin the coherence (i.e., the degree of linear correlation between soft and hard variability) in regions where the independent PSD components overlap [see Fig. 7, and 47].\n(Again, these thoughts are not new, and have been considered by Miyamoto and collaborators for Ginga data of\nGBHC; [48].)\nAgain, I believe the most fruitful avenue of research to\npursue is to start with a spectral decomposition and then\nwork forward towards the timing attributes, specifically,\nPSD, phase, and coherence. A very good example of this\napproach is the work by Poutanen and Gierlinski [49,\nand these proceedings], who modeled the X-ray spectra\nand variability of the pulsar SAX J1808.4\u22123658. One of\ntheir key results was to show that the measured phase\ncould be related to the individual spectral components.\nThis particular source, however, had the advantage of\nbeing relatively bright and having a strong variability\nfeature (i.e., the pulse). Thus there were good statistics\nfor performing such a spectral-temporal decomposition.\nBut what about GBHC where most variability features\nare broad?\nThis latter case is difficult because obtaining variability phase information requires extremely good statistics,\nand hence large effective areas. (Whereas there is an 'optimal filter' to remove many effects of Poisson noise from\nthe PSD, there is no optimal filter to minimize noise effects on phase measurements; [43, 44].) This seems to\nme a prime goal for 'spectral-temporal' studies that could\nbe performed by a successor to RXTE. Also, given sufficient detector area and the ability to spectrally decom-\n\npose rapid variability, we may yet consider performing\nspectral-temporal studies in the time domain (as opposed\nto the Fourier frequency domain). It is worthwhile noting\nthat, although Constellation-X is partly being designed\nwith the goal of 'reverberation mapping' of the broad\nFe line in AGN [50], a similar study in GBHC not only\nrequires a faster time response, but also larger effective\narea. The obtained signal-to-noise in a spectrum integrated over a characteristic time scale (viscous, thermal,\nor dynamical) is actually greater for AGN compared to\nGBHC [see the discussion of 2, and references therein].\nAgain, this suggests a successor mission to RXTE with\nits rapid timing capabilities, but substantially larger effective area.\n\nSUMMARY\nOver the past 30 years, we certainly have come a long\nway in our understanding of the spectra (at all wavelength bands, not just X-ray) of Galactic black hole binaries. Although many of the components of our theories\nand models have been in existence for a large fraction of\nthis history, it truly is the modern era, with four unique\nand complementary X-ray satellites, working in cooperation with other wavelength bands, wherein we are able to\nconduct careful tests of these concepts. Our capabilities\nwill increase further (with the launch of Swift and Astro\nE II, and the continuing missions of current satellites) in\nthe short-term future. The farther future promises more\nambitious instruments, i.e., Constellation-X, XEUS, and\nMAXIM, which will greatly enhance our knowledge of\nX-ray spectra.\nStill, if there is any cause for wistfulness, it will\nbe the eventual loss of the RXTE pointed instruments,\nPCA and HEXTE, and the RXTE All Sky Monitor.\nThe flexibility of RXTE has been crucial for multiwavelength spectroscopy, and it has reinvigorated the\nstudy of spectral-temporal correlations. If there is a\n'hole' to be filled in our, otherwise very exciting, future\nstudies of X-ray spectra, it is a new flexible satellite with\nrapid timing capabilities and effective area larger than\nRXTE.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating conversations\nwith Omer Blaes, Paolo Coppi, Sera Markoff, Jon Miller,\nand Christopher Reynolds.
