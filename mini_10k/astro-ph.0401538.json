Or were most (massive) galaxies already in place by z \u223c 1?\nIs late/current accretion significant or merely a perturbation? These questions\nmay best be addressed by a combination of detailed surveys of the Local Group,\nwhere quantitative resolved information may be obtained, together with spectroscopic surveys of galaxies as a function of redshift. Substantial progress on\nboth fronts is being made through the wealth of surveys underway and recently\nreported.\nSurveys are indeed the currently favoured means to progress in astrophysics:\na search through the journals or astro-ph for 'survey' immediately overloads any\nreading list. Equally noticeable is the current fashion to add a speculation\nabout current mergers to any paper studying any object in the Local Group,\nirrespective of its direct relevance to the specific data at hand. More fundamental\nis to consider if the rate and amplitude of the (clearly still happening) current\naccretion into the Milky Way is signal or noise, and is or is not consistent with\nmodel expectations.\nThat is, we should not aspire to show that current formation models correctly predict the Local Group, and its current merger activity: we know, from\ndirect observation, that current models require many better constraints to allow\ntheir improvement, to correspond to real galaxies. Our goal is to consider the\nobservations objectively, to quantify those constraints.\nSpectroscopic surveys of faint galaxies, especially those selected in the Kband, currently offer an excellent opportunity to address these questions for\nthe distant universe (Broadhurst et al. 1992; Cimatti etal 2003: see especially\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGerry Gilmore\n\nhttp://www.arcetri.astro.it/\u223ck20/). The results of these surveys, together\nwith current simulations of galaxy formation, provide the context in which Local\nGroup studies can be interpreted, by highlighting those aspects of current models\nwhere most progress is required.\nOne specific result of current deep surveys, which has been long established\nin the Galaxy, is the apparently long time since the galaxies were assembled.\nThis result, long known locally, and the subject of many continuing local investigations (eg Sandage, Lubin and VandenBerg 2003; see also N\u00f6rdstrom etal\n2004) identifies one of the most promising ways in which our understanding\nof galaxy formation can be improved and extended. In essence, galaxies seem\nto have formed earlier than current models expect, and have remained (relatively) undisturbed for a longer time than predicted. Extending and explaining\nthis contradiction promises to improve significantly our understanding not only\nof galaxy evolution, but also of the coupled question, the distribution of Dark\nMatter on small scales, and its corresponding temperature.\nIn one of the most impressive of recent studies, Cimatti etal (2002) present\nthe redshift distribution of a complete sample of 480 galaxies with Ks < 20\ndistributed over two independent fields covering a total area of 52 arcmin2 . A\n\"blind\" comparison was made with the predictions of a set of the most recent\n\u039bCDM hierarchical merging (HMM) and a set of pure luminosity evolution\n(PLE) models. The hierarchical merging models overpredict and underpredict\nthe number of galaxies at low-z and high-z respectively, whereas the PLE models\nmatch the median redshift and the low-z distribution, while still being able to\nfollow the high-z tail of N (z). These results are summarised in Figure 1.\nThese observational surveys illustrate the areas where current paradigmatic\nmodels can be most improved. In particular, \u039bCDM hierarchical merging models\nas they are currently implemented overpredict the total number of galaxies with\nKs < 20 in the K20 survey area by factors of 30-45%, and are inconsistent\nwith the observed galaxy redshift distribution by substantial factors, especially\nat high redshifts. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that all the hierarchical\nmerging models disagree with the observations at > 99% level.\nNonetheless, the hierarchical merging \u039bCDM scenario has spectacular success in reproducing large scale structure and CMB results, and is certainly the\nparadigm of choice in which we should analyse survey and galactic structure\ndata today. Our ambition is to improve the ability of this framework to become\nconsistent with the real physics of small-scale structure and galaxy formation,\nby identifying areas in which the input physics can be improved. The observed\ndiscrepancies derived from the high-redshift studies are related to what is essentially a purely heuristic set of algorithms adopted to describe the star formation\nprocesses and their feedback, both within individual galaxies and in their environment. The high-redshift results suggest that the galaxy formation recipes\nshould allow galaxy formation in a CDM dominated universe to occur in a manner described by the old-fashioned pre-CDM monolithic collapse scenario. This\nrequires the recipes to allow enhanced merging and star formation in massive\nhaloes at high redshift (say, z \u223c 3), while at the same time suppressing star\nformation in low-mass haloes.\n\n\fGalactic Structure and Evolution\n\nFigure 1.\nLHS: Top panels: the observed differential N (z) for Ks <\n20 (histogram) compared with the PLE model predictions.

These figures and captions are from\nCimatti etal 2002.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nGerry Gilmore\n\nWe now ask if this improved recipe would be consistent with the Milky Way,\nan L\u2217 galaxy whose properties should not be too rare in any plausible formation\nscenario.\n2.\n\nMergers, phase-space structures, fashion accessories\n\nSearch for and interpretation of phase-space structure in the Galaxy has always\nbeen important, but has recently become a major industry. Significant structure is unexpected in a context where galaxy photometrists provid convincing\nevidence for symmetric and smooth surface brightness profiles (eg Kormendy &\nDjorgovski 1989), where density profiles for special tracers (RR Lyraes being\npopular) show smooth profiles over very many scale lengths, and where local\nstellar kinematics looks closely Gaussian (cf Gilmore, Wyse & Kuijken 1989):\nclearly whatever process makes galaxies makes smooth-looking relaxed-looking\ngalaxies. Nonetheless, testing the paradigm is important. The current fashion is\nperhaps to start from the other extreme (cf Freeman & Bland-hawthorn 2002)\nwhere some aspire to \"associate components of the Galaxy to elements of the\nprotocloud\", an interesting alternative to the statistical distribution function\nanalyses on which the science of stellar dynamics has been built.\nEarlier searches for structure in the stellar distribution used techniques\nsuch as correlation functions (eg Gilmore, G.; Reid, N.; Hewett, P. 1985) or\npresumed local evolutionary processes were the default explanation of identified\nfield halo clustering (eg Arnold & Gilmore 1992). The many studies of Eggen on\nmoving groups were perhaps not given due recognition, since most were of thin\ndisk stars, disk structure is inevitably lumpy in phase space, and tells little of\nglobal or long-term galaxy evolution. His study of the Arcturus Moving Group\nwas however long understood as significant for thick-disk studies (cf Fuhrmann\n2004, sect 2.4) and appears as such in encyclopeadias, though is still being\nrediscovered. [Eggen however (private communication) was deeply sceptical of\nthe distinction between thin and thick disk moving groups.] gould (2003) has\nrecently reminded us that an apparently smooth distribution is either really\nsmooth - in which case its history is lost into statistical distribution functions\n\u2013 or the central limit theorem applies \u2013 in which case its history is lost into\nstatistical distribution functions.\nThe field changed rapidly after discovery of the Sgr dwarf galaxy (Ibata,\nGilmore & Irwin 1994, 1995), an object genuinely discovered in phase-space in\nreal-time at the AAT where Ibata and Gilmore were plotting colour-magnitudevelocity diagrams during their study of the Galactic Bulge (Ibata & Gilmore\n1995a, 1995b). While this discovery certainly activated the field (though the\nforthcoming 2MASS and SDSS surveys would have made the same discovery\nthrough traditional photometric, rather than phase-space, techniques) the reson\nit was possible seems not to have been fully appreciated by those attempting to\nemulate the discovery: Sgr was found because its stellar population is very different from that of the Galactic bulge or the Galactic halo. It is an intermediate\nage and intermediate metallicity population, and is unique in that respect.\nOne (should have) immediately deduced that Sgr was a rare event, not a\nparadigm for the average (see Unavane, Wyse & Gilmore 1996). The outcome\nof a truly impressive and truly vast amount of work since its discovery mapping\n\n\fGalactic Structure and Evolution\n\n5\n\nthe distribution of Sgr-related debris trails around the Galaxy has reinforced\nthis early conclusion: while much of Sgr is strewn around the Galaxy, nothing\nelse like it has left any trace of its demise in the last Hubble time. Except, of\ncourse, the Thick Disk (Gilmore & Reid 1983), whenever that got into place.\n\nFigure 2.\nElement ratio data (LHS) and kinematic correlations\n(RHS) in metal poor stars in the Galactic halo. These figures are\nfrom Gratton etal 2003.\n\n3.\n\nThe chemical elements as archaeological tracers\n\nThe recent surveys which have delivered the most quantitative information on\nGalactic history are those which provide high-precision elemental abundances for\nmany stars. There are many such recent surveys since the arrival of 8m telescopes\nwith excellent echelle spectrographs, with many more due to be published soon.\nThese range from studies of the most extreme metal-poor stars, through the\n'halo', 'thick disk' and 'thin disk' metallicity ranges, with only the Bulge and\ninner disk still awaiting useful statistics. The bulge and inner disk studies are\nespecially needed, since the common (modellers') presumption that 'the average\nstar forms in a disk, and then merges into a spheroid' merits a check.\nThe results from these studies are outstanding science, and provide information which must be considerde fully in any discussion of Galaxy formation\nand evolution.\nThe common feature to all studies is the extremely well-defined pattern\nof element ratios, spanning huge dynamic ranges. One example is shown in\nFigure 2, taken from a superb study by Gratton etal 2003. This figure shows\nthe common result: different stellar population show smooth systematic element\nratio patterns across very wide dynamic ranges.\nThe systematic chemical abundance patterns evident here, and the different\nsystematics between different stellar populations, provide undisputable evidence\nthat the formation of the field stars which are today in the Galactic halo happened in a single environment, or a range of environments, in which the rate of\nstar formation, the rate of mass loss and the rate of chemical enrichment had an\n\n\f6\n\nGerry Gilmore\n\nextremely small range. Noone has yet suggested how this is possible if indeed\nthe halo is built up over time from a large number of systems with uncorrelated\nhistories.\nOther recent studies extend this conclusion to the stars of the thick disk\nand the old thin disk.\n\nFigure 3.\nThe dissolving globular cluster Pal5 is creating phase space\nstructure in the Galactic halo which is unrelated to merger histories.\nSome hundreds of similar phase-space structures are expected to exist,\nall equally unrelated to mergers.\n\n4.\n\nMerger rates\n\nMergers happen. The Hubble-Toomre sequence is built that way.\nThe Sagittarius dwarf is direct evidence. In M32 the debris from the\nstripped elliptical M32 has recently been observed directly, decades after its\nprediction. The Magellanic Stream exists. It is possible that a further debris\nremnant has been discovered at low latitudes, although at the time of writing\nthe 'normal' complex structure of an outer warped disk is a more likely explanation of the observations. Similarly, speculations that structures, such as clusters,\ncould be trapped into the Galactic disk from a !merger parent' need to treated\nwith some caution. The depth of a potential scales as the square of its velocity\ndispersion, Thus the Galactic halo potential (dispersion \u223c100km/s) is an order of magnitude deeper than that of the disk (dispersion \u223c30km/s). Trapping\nsomething into the outer disk is not an obvious dynamical process without very\nspecial geometries, and adroit use of dynamical friction.\n\n\fGalactic Structure and Evolution\n\n7\n\nIs Sgr all there is?\nPhase space structures are not an indication of mergers. The most dramatic\nlocal phase-space structures are spiral arms, Gould's belt, and star-formation\nregions. Even in the halo, very considerable phase-space structure must exist\neven if there has never been a single merger in the Hubble time.\nGlobular clusters evolve, and evaporate eventually. It is often speculated\nthat many hundreds of dissolved globular clusters exist in the halo. A globular cluster, Pal5, has recently been observed in the final stages of dissolution\n(Odenkirchen etal 2003) and is shown in Figure 3.\nThe same limits on accretion histories which can be deduced from the difference of the stellar populations of Sgr, and are quantified for field stars by\nUnavane, Wyse and Gilmore (1996), can be applied to other tracers. The severe\ndifficulty of hiding stars with different enrichment histories in the element ratio\ndata is noted above. One may do the same thing for globular clusters. Bellazzini\nand collaborators are extending the census of former members of Sgr utilising\nthat fact that Sgr stellar populations are different from field stars. One may do\nthe same slightly more generally.\n\nFigure 4.\nThe size distributions of the various population types\nof Galactic globular clusters (LHS) and the old clusters in Galactic satellites (RHS). These data are from Mackey & Gilmore\n2003a,2003b,2003c.\nFigure 4 shows the size distribution (core radii, from of the different groups\nof Galactic globular clusters, and those old clsuters in Galactic satellites. Most\nclusters in Galactic satellites are young, thereby trivially excluding any (non-Sgr)\nmergers in the last \u223c6-8Gyr with anything resembling anything which exists in\nthe Local group now, or its precursors. Even older mergers are interesting in this\ncontext: the only Galactic globulars which are consistent, on size grounds, with\nhaving arrived in a merger are the few younger ones, including those associated\nalready with Sgr.\nOnce again, we conclude that mergers with sufficient mass to perturb the\nhistory of the Galaxy in an observable way must be rare in recent times.\n\n\f8\n\nGerry Gilmore\n\nFigure 5.\nKinematics of the thick disk in situ. The mean rotation\nvelocity about the Galaxy, V\u223c100km/s of field stars is significantly less\nthan expected from local studies, indicating perhaps that the (merger?)\norigins of the thick disk are amenable to direct study. This figure is\nfrom Gilmore, Wyse & Norris 2002.\n\n5.\n\nField star kinematic surveys: much still to learn\n\nKinematic surveys of field stars in the Galaxy remain as rare as is evidence for\nmultiple mergers in the Milky Way. Each of the few attempted has made significant discoveries (eg SDSS) which should be an encouragement. One for which\nthe first results have recently been reported indicates the discovery potential.\nGilmore, Wyse and Norris (2002) report first results from a survey using 2dF\n\n\fGalactic Structure and Evolution\n\n9\n\nFigure 6.\nThe Hubble-Toomre sequence: mergers matter, at least in\nlife-changing situations. But how often and when in daily existence is\nless clear. This figure is a .jpg file\non the AAT. their first results are summarised in Figure 5, and show significant\ndisagreement with expectation.\nThe mean star a few kpc from the Plane has angular momentum intermediate between that of the halo and the thin disk. This argues strongly for an\nindependent origin, and is consistent with - but does not require - a merger\norigin.\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nMergers happen. The Hubble-Toomre sequence is built that way (Figure 6).\nThis is an age of surveys. We are learning to process and distribute vast\ndata volumes. We are learning to extract astrophysics. While fashions still reign\nin interpretation, the story in the data is there to be read: it tells the story of\nGalaxy formation.\nReferences\nArnold, R,.
