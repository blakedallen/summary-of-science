If this measurement is combined with the expected error\nfor the total Higgs width, a precision of 10% on the \u03b3\u03b3 Higgs boson partial\nwidth appears feasible.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing the discovery of the Higgs boson, one of the main tasks of a future\nlinear e+ e\u2212 collider will be precise model-independent measurements of its fundamental couplings to fermions and bosons and its total width [1]. The branching\nfraction of the Higgs boson into two photons, BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ), is of special interest since deviations of BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) (or the diphoton Higgs partial width\n\u0393(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 )) from the Standard Model (SM) value provide sensitivity to new\nphysics. In particular, by virtue of the fact that the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 coupling can\nhave contributions from loops containing new charged particles, significant differences from the SM value are possible. Thus, a measurement of BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 )\nat the next linear collider will be an important contribution to understanding\nthe nature of the Higgs boson and may possibly provide hints for new physics,\nregardless of the size of the deviation from the SM prediction. The precision of\nthe H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction measurements within reach in e+ e\u2212 collisions is\nthe subject of this paper.\nThe ultimate goal of this measurement is to derive the diphoton Higgs boson\npartial width. However this needs knowledge of the total Higgs width. The\ntotal width of a light SM Higgs boson is too small to be observed directly [2].\nThe procedure for obtaining this quantity requires measurements of the product \u0393(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) * BF (H \u2192 bb\u0304) in the \u03b3\u03b3 collider option of a linear collider and\nBF (H \u2192 bb\u0304), a quantity easily accessible with high precision in e+ e\u2212 collisions\n[3]. As both these measurements can be achieved with an accuracy of few\npercent, the error of the total Higgs width will be dominated by the error of\nBF (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3).\nHowever, it has recently been demonstrated that a measurement of the branching fraction BF(H \u2192 W W \u2217 ) [4] at a high-luminosity linear e+ e\u2212 collider, combined with a precise value for the rate of the WW fusion process e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03bde \u03bd \u0304eH (or for the Higgsstrahlung production rate \u03c3(HZ) and assuming W,Zuniversality), would permit an accurate measurement of the total width of the\nHiggs boson.\nPrecise electroweak data indicate the existence of a light Higgs boson [5]\nwith a mass below about 200 GeV, with a preference for MH close to 120 GeV.\nHigh-luminosity linear e+ e\u2212 colliders in the energy range 300 to 500 GeV [6] are\nideal machines for performing precise measurements of the properties of such a\nparticle. In this paper we investigate the prospects of measuring the branching\nfraction BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) from events of the reactions\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\n\fand\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3\n\n\u221a\n\n(2)\n\nassuming a Higgs boson mass MH = 120 GeV, at s = 350 and 500 GeV and\nan integrated luminosity of 1 ab\u22121 at each energy.\n\u221a\nThe statistical precision for BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) is mainly determined by S + B/S,\nwhere S and B are respectively the number of signal and background events\nwithin a small interval of the two-photon invariant mass \u2206M\u03b3\u03b3 , centered around\nMH . Hence, evaluation of all relevant signal and background processes and optimization of selection procedures are mandatory, taking into account acceptances\nand resolutions of a linear collider detector.\nOur analysis is superior in some respects to the study of ref.[7]. It includes the\ncomplete irreducible background in reactions (1) and (2) and demonstrates for\nthe first time the gain in the precision of BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) when beam polarization\nis accounted for in signal and background events.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss simulation of the\nHiggs signal and background events and their detector response. In Sections 3\nand 4 we present our results for unpolarized BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) measurements at\n\u221a\ns = 350 and 500 GeV, respectively. In Section 5 we discuss improvements to\nthe H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction measurement with beam polarization. Section 6\nsummarizes the conclusions.\n\n2\n\nSignal and Background Reactions\n\nIn e+ e\u2212 collisions the Higgs boson is produced by two different processes, the\nHiggsstrahlung process\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH\n(3)\n\nand the weak boson (WW and ZZ) fusion reactions\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bde\u03bd \u0304e H\n\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 H\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThe ZZ fusion process (5) is strongly suppressed with respect to reaction\n\u221a\n(4) (by about a factor of 10 relatively independent of s). Therefore, only\nthe Higgsstrahlung and WW fusion reactions (3) and (4) are considered in this\nstudy. These processes are part of the 2-to-4 body reactions (1) and (2) if\nonly the most important Z \u2192 q q\u0304 (of \u223c70%) and \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 (of \u223c20%) decays and the\nH \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay are accounted for.

In this way, Higgs boson production and the\ncomplete irreducible background as well as possible interferences are taken into\naccount. The branching fraction for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 was imported from the program\npackage HDECAY [10]. It depends on the Higgs mass and is largest near MH =\n120 GeV. In this study we used BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 )= 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22123.\nThe Higgsstrahlung reaction (3) is characterized by two hadronic jets originating from the Z, together with two energetic photons with an invariant mass\nequal to MH . The background expected in reaction (1) comes from the 100\nlowest-order diagrams with q = d, u, s, c, b, which are shown, for the d-quark\nas an example, in Fig. 1. The most serious background arises from the double\nbremsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3. Because of its importance, Z\u03b3\u03b3\nevents estimated with CompHEP have been cross-checked at the generator level\nwith KORALZ 4.2 [11] and found to be in good agreement in the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant\nmass range relevant for this study.\nFor the signal events in reaction (2), with contributions from WW fusion and\nHiggsstrahlung processes (and small interferences between them), we expect a\nsignature of two photons, producing two large electromagnetic neutral showers\n\n\fe e+\n\ne\n\ne\ne\nW+\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\nZ\n\ne\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\n\u0017e\nW+\nW+\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\ne\n\nZ\n\n\u0017\u0016\n\u0017\n\u0016\u0016\n\nZ\n\nW+\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\n\nZ\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\n\u0016\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\nW+\nW+\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\u0017e\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\nZ\n\ne\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\n\ne\n\nW+\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\u0016\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\ne\n\ne\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\n! \u0017 \u0017\u0016\n\n\u0017\u001c\n\u0017\n\u0016\u001c\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\ne\n\nW+\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\nZ\n\nW+\nW+\n\ne\n\u0016\n\n\u0017\u0016\n\u0017\n\u0016\u0016\n\n\u0017\u001c\n\u0017\n\u0016\u001c\n\n\u0017e\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\u0017e\n\nW+\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\ne\nZ\n\nW+\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\ne\n\ne\n\n\u0017e\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\n\ne\n\u0016\n\ne\ne\n\ne\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u0017\n\u0016e\n\n\u0017\u0016\n\u0017\n\u0016\u0016\n\n\u0017\u001c\n\u0017\n\u0016\u001c\n\ne\n\nFigure 2: Background diagrams for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3.\n\nin the detector with no other activities, and large missing energy due to the two\nundetected neutrinos. The background diagrams contributing to reaction (2)\nare shown in Fig. 2. They were accounted for at the same level as the signal\nevents. Again, the most serious, irreducible background was found to arise from\nthe double bremsstrahlung process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3.\nPossible reducible backgrounds to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ events which might mimic the\nsignal, such as the reactions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZZ and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W W with large cross\nsections, were found to be very small after application of selection criteria.\nProcesses like e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) or e+ e\u2212 \u2192 (e+ e\u2212 ) \u03b3\u03b3, when both electrons\nare undetected, might constitute a significant background to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH, \u03bd \u03bd\u0304H\n\u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 events. However, after kinematical cuts their rates were also found to\nbe small or negligible.\nAs the cross sections for the background discussed are orders of magnitude\nlarger than the signal cross sections, we first applied the following principal cuts\nat the generation level, to both the signal and background events:\n\u2022 the transverse energy, ET , for each photon exceeds 20 GeV;\n\u2022 the two-photon invariant mass, M\u03b3\u03b3 , is required to be larger than 100 GeV;\n\u2022 the q q\u0304 invariant mass, Mqq\u0304 , is within MZ \u00b1 20GeV.\n\n\fAfter these criteria, practically all Higgs events survive, while background\ncontributions are substantially reduced.\nThe detector response for all signal and the remaining background events\nwas simulated with the parametrized detector simulation package SIMDET [12]\nusing parameters as presented in the Conceptual Design Report [6].\n\n3\n\nBF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) measurement at 350 GeV\n\nDifferent Higgs event rates are expected from processes (3) and (4) at our two\n\u221a\nenergies, s = 350 and 500 GeV. The Higgsstrahlung cross section scales, after\na maximum close its threshold, with 1/s, while the fusion cross section rises\n\u221a\nlogarithmically with s. At 350 GeV, the Higgsstrahlung cross section is approximately 140 fb for MH = 120 GeV, which is about four times larger than the\nWW fusion cross section. Since the Z boson hadronic decay is by far dominant,\nq q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 events constitute the main source of the Higgs signal at 350 GeV. The Z\ninvisible \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 decay in the Higgsstrahlung and the fusion channels lead to identical\nevent topologies - two isolated high energy photons and a large missing energy\ndue to the two undetected neutrinos - are treated together in our study.\nConsidering only Z branching fractions into q q\u0304 and \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 and the Higgs decay\ninto two photons, we expect about 220 respectively 130 Higgs events in reactions\n(1) and (2) at 350 GeV for an integrated luminosity of 1 ab\u22121. Different event\nselection procedures were applied to the q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 and \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 event samples in order\nto account for their distinct properties in the final state.\nIn order to avoid large not useful event samples the following preselection\nprocedure was applied to the 2-jet 2-photon candidates:\n\u2022 at least two isolated neutral clusters compatible with photons exist, with\ntransverse energy ET > 20 GeV for each;\n\u2022 no particle exists in a half cone of 10o around the isolated photon directions;\n\u2022 the number of charged tracks per event exceeds 5;\n\u221a\n\u2022 the visible event energy, Evis, exceeds 0.8 \u00d7 s GeV;\n\u2022 the total momentum along the beam direction is within \u00b1 100 GeV;\n\u2022 all particles, excluding the two selected photons, were forced into two hadronic\njets with an invariant mass compatible with the Z boson, 70 < Mjj < 110\nGeV.\n\n\fAfter all cuts the background to the Higgsstrahlung events close to MH was\nsignificantly reduced, but still one order of magnitude larger than the signal,\nso further and more stringent selection criteria were necessary to improve the\nsignal-to-background ratio.\nIn a first trial, we applied the conventional method of using consecutive cuts\non kinematical variables. In particular, we demanded\n\u2022 the energy of the two-photon system is between 140 < E\u03b3\u03b3 < 200 GeV;\n\u2022 the transverse energy of the two-photon system is larger than 50 GeV;\n\u2022 each photon polar angle is restricted to |cos\u03b8\u03b3 | < 0.9;\n\u2022 the polar angle of the two-photon system is required to be |cos\u03b8\u03b3\u03b3 | < 0.8.\n\nThese cuts gave a selection efficiency of 56% for Higgs signal events.\nSecondly, we applied a more sophisticated selection procedure. Kinematical\nvariables of the final state photons and of the \u03b3\u03b3 subsystem were combined into a\nglobal discriminant variable PH 1 . This quantity can be considered as a measurement of the \"Higgs-likeness\" of an event, with 0\u2264 PH \u2264 1. Background events\nare preferably distributed at low PH values while for Higgs signal events PH is\nclose to 1. The distribution of PH is shown in Fig. 3, and a cut of PH > 0.85\nwas applied to select the Higgs candidates. This method results to a signal\nselection efficiency of 42% and 2.3 times less background, so that a significant\nbetter signal-to-background ratio exists compared to the application of consecutive cuts. Therefore, only results using the discriminant variable procedure are\ndiscussed in the following. The \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass spectrum for q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 signal and\nsurviving background events is shown in Fig. 4a. The superimposed curve is the\nresult of a fit to the sum of a Gaussian, used to describe the signal, and a second\norder polynomial function, which was found to describe the background in very\ngood approximation between 110 and 130 GeV.\nFrom the normalizations of the signal and background, which were allowed\nto vary, the number of signal and background events in an optimal M\u03b3\u03b3 window\nwidth of 2.5 GeV around MH is obtained2. These numbers are collected in\nTable 1 and suggest a statistical error of 27% for \u03c3(HZ) * BF (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) in the\nreaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3.\nThe Higgs signal selection from the \u03b3\u03b3\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 final state relies on events without\ncharged tracks in the detector. For the neutral clusters, compatible with photons,\nthe following criteria were required:\n1\n\nIn particular, the quantities used are: energies, transverse energies and polar angles of both photons, the\nangle between the photons and the energy, the transverse energy and the polar angle of the \u03b3\u03b3 system\n2\nIn order to estimate the optimized number of signal to background events for a narrow Gaussian resonance\nwhose observed width is dominated by instrumental effects, the mass window chosen should be 1.2 \u0393exp , centered\non the actual Higgs mass.\n\n\fEvents/0.01\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n,,\n,,\nHiggs-likeness probability\n\nFigure 3: \"Higgs-likeness\" probability for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 events (shaded)\nand the background considered.\n\n\u2022 at least two electromagnetic clusters have transverse energies larger than\n20 GeV;\n\u2022 their polar angles are within |cos\u0398\u03b3 | < 0.9;\n\u2022 the polar angle of the two-photon system is restricted to |cos\u0398\u03b3\u03b3 | < 0.8.\nThese cuts gave a Higgs selection efficiency of 45% and removed possible\nbackgrounds to a large extent. The resulting M\u03b3\u03b3 mass distribution is shown in\nFig. 4b. The number of signal and background events, obtained from\n\u221a an analogous fit procedure, are also shown in Table 1.

Surviving background arises\nmainly from W-exchange diagrams shown in Fig. 2, with two photons radiated\nfrom the beam particle(s). The transverse energy cut applied removes part of\nthis background.\nThe M\u03b3\u03b3 distribution for the \u03b3\u03b3\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 events selected is shown in Fig. 5b. The\nnumbers obtained for the signal and background events as well as the precision\nfor \u03c3 * BF (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) \u2243 16.4% are also given in Table 1.\n\n\f5\n\nPolarization\n\nLinear e+ e\u2212 colliders offer the possibility for longitudinal polarized electron and\npositron beams, with varying polarization degrees in right-handed or left-handed\nmodes. Higgs boson production rates in both processes (3) and (4) depends\nsignificantly on the polarization degree and the helicity of the incoming particles.\nThe Higgs cross section for given electron (P\u2212 ) and positron (P+ ) polarizations\nnormalized to the unpolarized case can be expressed by\nRi = 1 + \u03b7i(P\u2212 \u2212 P+ ) \u2212 P\u2212 P+ ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b7i is the asymmetry factor for the cross sections, \u03b7i = (\u03c3i+\u2212 \u2212\u03c3i\u2212+)/(\u03c3i+\u2212 +\n\u03c3i\u2212+), with different indices i to indicate the Higgsstrahlung (i=1) and the\nWW fusion (i=2) reactions. \u03c3i+\u2212(\u03c3i\u2212+) denotes the cross section for 100%\nright-handed (left-handed) polarized electrons in collision with 100% left-handed\n(right-handed) polarized positrons. The asymmetry factors were calculated with\nCompHEP to \u03b71 = \u22120.21 and \u03b72 = \u22121. For the WW fusion process the absolute\nvalue of the asymmetry \u03b72 is maximal, as this process occurs only via a selected\ncombination of electron and positron helicities. If only the e\u2212 beam is polarized,\nRi = 1 + \u03b7i P\u2212 . Some Ri values for various left- and right-handed beam particle\npolarization degrees are shown in Table 2, which illustrates the potential of polarized colliding beams for Higgs boson physics at a linear collider. Obviously,\nonly left-handed e\u2212 which collide with right-handed e+ with largest polarization\ndegrees as possible enhance the Higgs event rates at most.\nHowever, the dominant background in processes (1) and (2), such as Z\u03b3\u03b3\nand W-exchange \u03bde\u03bd \u0304e \u03b3\u03b3, scale in approximately the same way with beam polarizations as the signal processes, as was verified by CompHEP simulations.\nHence, the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass spectra shown in Figs.4 and 5 can be rescaled by\nthe appropriate Ri factor, and the statistical\nprecision of the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching\n\u221a\nfraction is improved by only a factor Ri .\nFor the idealized case of collisions of perfect left-polarized e\u2212 with perfect\nright-polarized e+ beams the precision achievable for \u03c3(H) * BF (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) is\nexpected to be 10.3% and 8.2% at 350 and 500 GeV, respectively, after combining reactions (3) and (4) at 350 GeV and considering only reaction (4) at 500\nGeV. For the feasible (ambitious) case of collisions of 80% left-handed electrons with 40 (60)% rigth-handed positrons [13] the statistical precision for\n\u221a\n\u03c3(H) * BF (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = 12.8 (12.1)%, respectively, 10.2 (9.6)% at s = 350\nand 500 GeV, for 1 ab\u22121 integrated luminosity. The errors of the diphoton\nbranching fraction of the Higgs boson are then deduced after convolution with\nthe uncertainties for the inclusive Higgs production rates which are expected to\nbe close or better than 2% [14].\n\n\fe\u2212 beam (P\u2212 ) e+ beam (P+) e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HZ e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bde\u03bd\u0304e H\n+1\n0\n0.79\n0\n-1\n0\n1.21\n2\n+0.8\n0\n0.83\n0.2\n-0.8\n0\n1.17\n1.8\n+1\n-1\n1.58\n0\n-1\n+1\n2.42\n4\n+0.8\n-0.4\n1.07\n0.12\n-0.8\n+0.4\n1.57\n2.52\n+0.8\n-0.6\n1.19\n0.08\n-0.8\n+0.6\n1.77\n2.88\nTable 2: Cross section scaling factors of Higgsstrahlung and WW fusion processes for various left-handed and rigth-handed polarization degrees, normalized\nto the unpolarized event rates.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this study we examined the prospect at a future linear e+ e\u2212 collider of measuring the branching fraction of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson into two\nphotons, BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ). A Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV and an integrated\n\u221a\nluminosity of 1 ab\u22121 at either s = 350 or 500 GeV were assumed. In order\nto estimate the precision attainable on BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ), all expected backgrounds\nwere included in the analysis, and acceptances and resolutions of a linear collider detector were convoluted. In particular, by simulating the 2-to-4 particle\nreactions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3, in which the signal reactions are\nembedded, the complete irreducible background has been accounted for.\nAt 350 GeV, where both the Higgsstrahlung and the WW fusion mechanisms\ncontribute significantly, the statistical error for BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) is 18%, after combining both Higgs production channels and and convolution with the uncertainty\nof the more easily measurable inclusive Higgs boson cross sections. It should be\nnoted that the isolation of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH \u2192 q q\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 signal events required a multidimensional analysis on a likelihood estimator. Otherwise, background from\ndouble bremsstrahlung is overwhelming and greatly hinders the BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 )\nmeasurement.\nAt 500 GeV, only the \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 final state is worth consideration and the application of consecutive cuts on kinematical variables resulted in a reasonable\n\n\fsignal-to-noise ratio and a convincing signal. The relative precision expected for\nthe H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction is found to be 16%.\nIf 80% left-handed electrons collide with 40 (60)% right-handed positrons\nthe Higgsstrahlung and WW fusion cross sections are significantly enhanced,\nso improving substantially the precision on BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ), even taking into\naccount that the background scales in the same way. Under such circumstances,\nthe uncertainty for BF(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 ) is lowered to 12.8 (12.1)% and 10.2 (9.6)%\n\u221a\nat s = 350 and 500 GeV, respectively. With these uncertainties it should\nbe possible to deduce a relative precision for the diphoton Higgs partial width\n\u221a\n\u2243\n13.5%(12.6%)\nand\n11.1%(10.6%)\nat\nof \u2206\u0393(H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\ns = 350 and 500 GeV,\n\u0393(H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\nrespectively, if an uncertainty of 4.3% for the total Higgs width [14] is accounted\nfor. These uncertainties are about a factor 5 worse than those expected from\nthe reaction \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u0304 [15], measurable after conversion of an e+ e\u2212 collider\nto a Compton collider.\n\nAcknowledgments\nE.B. and R.S. would like to thank DESY Zeuthen for the kind hospitality, support and fruitful coorperation.
