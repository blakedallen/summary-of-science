The amplitude-phase formulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is\ninvestigated within the context of uncoupled Ermakov systems, whereby the amplitude\nfunction is given by the auxiliary nonlinear equation. The classical limit of the\namplitude and phase functions is analyzed by setting up a semiclassical Ermakov\nsystem. In this limit, it is shown that classical quantities, such as the classical\nprobability amplitude and the reduced action, are obtained only when the semiclassical\namplitude and the accumulated phase are non-oscillating functions respectively of the\nspace and energy variables.

Introduction\nSystems of the form\n1\nY (\u03b1(t)/u(t))\n\u03c1u2 (t)\n1\nZ(u(t)/\u03b1(t)),\n\u2202t2 \u03b1(t) + k 2 (t)\u03b1(t) =\nu\u03b12(t)\n\u2202t2 u(t) + k 2 (t)u(t) =\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere Y and Z are arbitrary functions of their arguments, are generically known as\nErmakov systems. They are characterized by the existence of a first integral, the\nErmakov (or Lewis-Ray-Reid) invariant linking the solutions of Eqs. (1) and (2), thereby\ngiving rise to the so-called nonlinear superposition principle. Intensive studies of their\nproperties, such as their linearization [1] or their generalization to higher dimensions\n[2, 3] have been undertaken to extend the remarkable results concerning uncoupled\nsystems, ie Y (\u03b6) = 0 and Z(\u03b6) = a2 \u03b6 where a is a constant, obtained by Ray and Reid\n[6, 7].\nAlthough the paradigm in physical applications of uncoupled Ermakov systems has\nbeen the classical linear time-dependent harmonic oscillator (t being the time variable),\nwhere the full power of Hamiltonian structure [4], Lagrangian mechanics and Noether\nsymmetries [5] have been employed, it has also been remarked that uncoupled systems\nlink the time-independent linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation to a nonlinear 'auxiliary' equation\nin the following way:\nh\u03042 \u2202x2 u(x) + p2 (x)u(x) = 0\nh\u03042 a2\n2 2\n2\nh\u0304 \u2202x \u03b1(x) + p (x)\u03b1(x) = 3 ,\n\u03b1 (x)\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere x refers to the space variable, and p(x, E) to its conjugate momentum in classical\nmechanics. E is the energy, assumed to be conserved, of the system. We have recently\nshown [8] that the non-linear equation (4) corresponds to the equation for the amplitude\nfunction \u03b1(x) in the amplitude-phase formulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which\narises by performing a so-called Milne transform on the wave-function; the phase\nfunction \u03c6(x) is obtained by integrating the relation \u2202x \u03c6 = \u03b1\u22122 (see Sec. 2).\nWe shall be concerned throughout this paper by the oscillatory properties of the\nsolutions of the uncoupled Ermakov system formed by Eqs. (3) and (4) in the specific\ncase of a potential energy function having a single minimum. Actually, since Eq. (3)\ndefines a Sturm-Liouville problem, the oscillatory properties of the solutions are wellknown [9], and we will restrict our analysis to the oscillations as a function of x and E,\nof the amplitude and phase functions. Our first aim will be to show that, absolutely\nsmooth, that is non-oscillating amplitude-phase functions can be constructed. Let us\nrecall that the amplitude-phase formulation of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nis frequently used in quantum scattering theories that explicitly include closed channels,\nsuch as quantum defect theory (see [8] and references therein). In those situations, it is of\nprime importance for \u03b1(x, E) to be a smooth function of both the space (usually radial)\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n3\n\ncoordinate x and the energy E, since the scattering parameters (for example the phaseshifts) are defined in terms of amplitude-phase functions. However, by the principle\nof nonlinear superposition (Sec. 2.1), \u03b1 may be expressed in terms of 2 independent\nsolutions u1 and u2 of Eq. (3) \u2013 solutions which as known oscillate between the turning\npoints of the potential. It follows that \u03b1(x) generally oscillates between the turning\npoints. In practical implementations of amplitude-phase formalisms, numerical methods\naiming at minimizing the amplitude of the oscillations have been devised. We have\nproposed in [8] such a method based on the invariant and the nonlinear superposition\nprinciple in the context of Ermakov systems. Here, the main point to be examined\nconsists in the relationship between non-oscillating amplitude-phase functions and the\nfunctions obtained in the semiclassical (h\u0304 \u2192 0) limit. More specifically, we will prove\nthat in this limit, the only non-oscillating solutions are the ones that yield classical\nquantities: in particular, the only semiclassical phase function that does not oscillate is\nthe classical reduced action, and conversely the quantum continuation, for finite h\u0304, of\nthe classical reduced action is a non-oscillating function.\nTo this end, some properties of amplitude-phase functions, their behaviour as a\nfunction of x and E, as well as the connection with Ermakov systems will be recalled in\nSec. 2. In Sec. 3, we shall discuss semiclassical amplitude-phase functions by setting up\na semiclassical Ermakov system; the classical probability amplitude and reduced action\nwill appear as a particular solution of the semiclassical amplitude and phase functions.\nThose results will then be employed in a formal h\u0304 expansion of the quantum amplitudephase functions, to prove that provided the first order functions are non-oscillating, the\nsolutions to each order in h\u0304 will then not oscillate (Sec. 4). This will be followed in Sec.\n5 by a discussion of the results, in particular in relation to quantization of classically\nintegrable systems.\n2. Amplitude-phase functions\nOur concern here will be the 'auxiliary' amplitude and phase functions of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nEq. (3), with p2 (x) = 2m(E \u2212 V (x)), ie a particle of mass m and energy E trapped in\na potential well V (x) having a single minimum. V (x) is defined on an interval ]s1 , s2 [\n(typically s1,2 = \u00b1\u221e or 0). Atomic units will be used throughout, except for the h\u0304\nfactors which will be reestablished where appropriate.\n2.1. Nonlinear superposition principle\nWe collect in this paragraph the main results concerning amplitude-phase functions\nthat will be useful in what follows, omitting details (for more details and the relevant\nreferences, see [8]). Eq. (3) defines a Sturm-Liouville problem, typically a singular\nproblem on the half line or real line when vanishing boundary conditions at s1 and\ns2 are implemented. However, our interest lies not in the specific eigenfunctions or\neigenvalues of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, but in relating linearly independent solutions\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n4\n\nof the linear equation to amplitude and phase functions. We will denote by u1 and\nu2 two independent solutions of Eq. (3) respectively regular at s1 and s2 and with\nWronskian W = W[u1 , u2 ] \u2261 (\u2202x u1 )u2 \u2212 u1 (\u2202x u2 ) .\nA general solution u(x) of Eq. (3), which is readily written in terms of the\nindependent solutions u1 and u2 , may also be obtained as\nu(x) = b1 \u03b1(x) sin [\u03c6(x) + b2 ] ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere b1 and b2 are complex constants. A straightforward substitution in Eq. (3) leads\nto the two equations\n\u2202x2 \u03b1(x) + p2 (x)\u03b1(x) = \u03b1(x) [\u2202x \u03c6(x)]2\na\n\u03b12 (x) =\n\u2202x \u03c6\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere we can set a2 = 1 without any loss of generality (since a2 can be absorbed into\n\u03b1 by redefining \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1/a1/2 ), thus recovering Eq. (4). For obvious reasons, \u03b1 and \u03c6\nare known respectively as the amplitude and phase functions. In terms of u1 and u2 ,\nit follows from standard results on Ermakov systems that the general solution for \u03b1 is\ngiven by\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n2I\n4Ic\n1\n+ 2Ic2 u21 (x) + 2 u22 (x) \u2212\nu1 (x)u2 (x)\n\u03b1(x) =\n2I\nW\nW\nand the equation for the phase is readily integrated to give\n\u03c6(x) = arctan\n\n\"\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n#\n\n\u00151/2\n\nu1 (x)\n1\n+ 2Ic2 W\n\u2212 2Ic + arctan 2Ic,\n2I\nu2 (x)\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the integration constant is chosen so that \u03c6(s1 ) = 0. Eq. (8) is an illustration\nof the nonlinear superposition principle [7]. I and c are two constants, independent of\nx (I is the Ermakov, or Lewis-Ray-Reid, invariant). Note that the value of the phase\nfunction at s2 , known as the accumulated phase, does not depend on the constants I\nand c for the eigenvalues E0 of the Sturm-Liouville problem, since\n\u03c6(s2 , E = E0 ) = \u03c0n,\n\n(10)\n\n2n + 1\n\u03c0;\n(11)\n2\nhere n is an integer giving the number of nodes of u2 . Note also that \u03b1(x1 ) is independent\nof c if x1 is a zero of u1 .\n\u03c6(s2 , E 6= E0 ) = arctan [2Ic(E)] +\n\n2.2. Boundary conditions and energy dependence\nThe boundary conditions for \u03b1 and \u03c6 are therefore incorporated through the parameters\nI(E) and c(E), which as indicated depend on the energy. Normalization of the\neigenfunctions f of the Sturm-Liouville problem with vanishing boundary conditions\nat s1 and s2 , yields\nZ\n\ns2\n\ns1\n\nf 2 (x)dx = I\u2202E \u03c6(s2 , E = E0 ).\n\n(12)\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n5\n\nBy choosing the eigenfunctions to be normalized per unit energy increment, I becomes\nan energy-independent positive constant, and amplitude and phase functions depend on\nthe single parameter c(E).\nWe now introduce another solution g(x) of the Schr\u00f6dinger Eq. (3), defined in\nterms of the solutions regular at s1 and s2 by\ng(x, c) = 2I\n\n!\n\nu2 (x)\n\u2212 cu1 (x) ,\nW\nh\n\n(13)\ni1/2\n\nwhich fulfills W[u1 , g] = 2I and gives \u03b1(x) = 2I1 (u21 (x) + g 2 (x))\n. This simply means\nthat u1 and g lag \u03c0/2 out of phase, and that with the conventions of Sec. 2.1 (a = 1\nand \u03c6(s1 ) = 0), we have\n\u221a\n(14)\nu1 (x) = 2I\u03b1(x, c) sin \u03c6(x, c),\n\u221a\ng(x, c) = 2I\u03b1(x, c) cos \u03c6(x, c).\n(15)\nWe have emphasized the c-dependence of the different functions (though self-consistency\nrequires it, it may be checked explicitly that u1 does not depend on c).\n2.3. Oscillatory properties\n2.3.1. Oscillations of the amplitude Let t1 (E) (t2 (E)) be the inner (outer) turning\npoint. For values beyond the turning points (when x < t1 or x > t2 ), we recast Eq. (6)\nas\n1\nh\u03c6; xi = p2 (x) \u2212 \u03b1\u22124 (x),\n(16)\n2\nwhere h\u03c6; xi \u2261 \u2202x3 \u03c6/\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 23 (\u2202x2 \u03c6/\u2202x \u03c6)2 denotes the Schwartzian derivative. Since \u03b1\nis a positively defined quadratic form and p2 (x) < 0 beyond the turning points, the\nSchwartzian derivative of the phase is negative, and as it can be verified, if h\u03c6; xi < 0 on\nan interval then \u2202x \u03c6 cannot have a positive local minimum on this interval, ie \u03b1 cannot\nhave a local maximum. By noting that \u03b1(x) \u2192 +\u221e when x \u2192 s1 and x \u2192 s2 , we\nconclude that if \u03b1 does not oscillate between the turning points, it will not oscillate on\nthe whole interval ]s1 , s2 [. Note that there is then a unique value x0 , with t1 < x0 < t2 ,\nsuch that \u2202x \u03b1(x0 ) = 0.\nHowever, as u1 (x) and u2 (x) oscillate for t1 < x < t2 , \u03b1 will generally oscillate, by\nvirtue of the nonlinear superposition principle Eq. (8), between the turning points, the\nlocal wavelength being half that of u1 or u2 . Nonetheless, at a specified energy, there\nmay be infinitely many values of c giving a non-oscillating amplitude function\u2021. We\ngive in the following paragraphs a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for c(E), that\nis the value of c and its explicit energy-dependence, because this value has remarkable\nproperties related to classical quantities in the semiclassical limit, as will be seen in Sec.\n3.\n\u2021 For example, taking the second derivative of \u03b1, it is seen that any value of c enclosed between c\u00b1 (x),\n\u00031/2\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u0002\nand where x spans the interval\nwith c\u00b1 (x) = u2 (x) [W u1 (x)] \u00b1 [2Iu1 (x)]\n2I/p(x) \u2212 u21 (x)\nbetween the turning points, will do.\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n6\n\n2.3.2. Inverted phase accumulation Proceeding as in Sect. 2.1, we can define a phase\nfunction \u03c6\u0304(x) such that \u03c6\u0304(s2 ) = 0, ie the phase starts accumulating at s2 instead of s1 .\nAs can be easily seen, this amounts to exchange the roles of u1 and u2 ; for instance, we\nnow have u2 = b2 \u1fb1 sin \u03c6\u0304, where \u2202x \u03c6\u0304 = \u1fb1(x)\u22122 and b2 is a constant to be set below. \u1fb1 is\ngiven by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2I\n4I c\u0304\n1\n2\n2\n+ 2I c\u0304 u22 (x) + 2 u21 (x) +\nu1 (x)u2 (x),\n(17)\n\u1fb1 (x) =\n2I\nW\nW\nwith W[u2 , u1 ] = \u2212W and where we assumed I = I \u0304 for simplicity. Generally \u03b1(x, c)\nand \u1fb1(x, c\u0304) are very different functions (for example the c\u0304 independent points of \u1fb1 are\nnow located at the zeros of u2 ). Notwithstanding, it is apparent that \u03b1(x, c) = \u1fb1(x, c\u0304)\niff c2 = c\u03042 = W \u22122 \u2212 (2I)\u22122 and c\u0304 = \u2212c. We shall set\nh\n\nco (E) = \u2212 [W (E)]\u22122 \u2212 [2I]\u22122\n\ni1/2\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nTo keep the quadratic form real, this implies that W 2 < 4I 2 , condition to be assumed\nin the rest of the paper (this is not a problem in practice because \u03b1 and \u03c6 are left\nunchanged by the transformations u1 \u2192 \u03bau1 , W \u2192 \u03baW, I \u2192 \u03ba2 I, c \u2192 c/\u03ba2 , so the\nWronskian can be conveniently rescaled).\nLet us now suppose that c = \u2212c\u0304 = \u00b1co . We then have \u03b1 = \u1fb1. b2 is found\n\u221a by\nevaluating W[u1 , u2] at s2 , which yields, by choosing a proper sign convention b2 = 2I.\nFrom Eqs. (13)-(15), it follows that\n\u0014\n\nh\n\nsin \u03c6\u0304(\u2213c0 ) = W cos \u03c6(\u00b1co )/2I \u2213 W\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2212 (2I)\n\ni\n\u22122 1/2\n\n\u0015\n\nsin \u03c6(\u00b1co ) ,\n\n(19)\n\nthereby obtaining the relation between \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0304, which give the oscillations of u1 and u2\nonly if \u03b1 does not oscillate.\n2.3.3. Auxiliary quadratic form on the unit circle \u03b12 (x) is a positive definite quadratic\nform. Labelling M the matrix of the coefficients, we have det M = W \u22122 and\nTr M = 1/2I + 2Ic2 + 2I/W 2 . \u03b12 (x) can be reduced to the canonical form\n\u03b12 (x, c) = \u03bb1 (c)v12 (x, c) + \u03bb2 (c)v22 (x, c),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03bbi (c) are the eigenvalues of M (\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 ) and vi (x, c) are the eigenvectors,\nnormalized so that v12 (x, c) + v22 (x, c) = u21 (x) + u22 (x). We now introduce a quadratic\nform Q defined by\nQ(x, c) = \u03bb1 (c)w12(x, c) + \u03bb2 (c)w22(x, c),\n\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nwhere wi2(x, c) = vi2 (x, c) [u21 (x) + u22(x)] . As indicated, Q, as well as the \u03bbi and vi\nare c-dependent. Q oscillates between its maximum and minimum values, which are by\nconstruction given respectively by \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 .\nWe now set c = \u00b1co . Let x1 (x2 ) label the points where u1 (u2 ), vanishes; we then\nhave Q(x1,2 , \u00b1co ) = 2I/W 2, so that between 2 zeros of u1 and u2 , Q(x, \u00b1co ) has at\nleast one extremum on the unit circle (for those points, the equality u21 (x) = u22 (x) is\nfulfilled). Note that \u03b1(x, c = \u00b1co ) goes through both the c-independent points of \u03b1(x, c)\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n7\n\nand \u1fb1(x, c\u0304), so if \u03b1 oscillates, then there is an extremum of \u03b1 between x1 and x2 , and the\nsign of \u2202x \u03b1 alternates between the consecutive zeros of u1 and u2. This is illustrated on\nFig. 1 for the specific case of the harmonic oscillator (to be discussed in details in Sec.\n5.4); the zeros of u1 and u2 are respectively shown as triangles and rectangles. Note also\nthat the maxima of Q(co ) correspond to the minima of Q(\u2212co ), since Q(\u2212co ) = Q\u0304(co ).\nCombining Eqs. (20) and (21) and taking the derivative \u2202x \u03b1(x1,2 ) as a function of \u2202x Q,\nQ, u1 and u2 , it can be seen indeed that for c = \u2212co the sign of \u2202x \u03b1 at 2 consecutive\nzeros, x1 and x2 , alternates. However, for c = co , the sign of \u2202x \u03b1 between 2 consecutive\narbitrary zeros of u1 and u2 does not change, and thus \u03b1(co ) does not oscillate\u00a7.\n2.3.4. Oscillations of the accumulated phase We have explained in [8] why obtaining\nnon-oscillatory functions is important when amplitude-phase methods are employed in\nscattering theory. The goal there is to extend energy-normalization, which for the\neigenfunctions of the Sturm-Liouville problem is given by Eq. (12), to functions f (x)\nwhich converge at s2 but diverge at s1 (the phase-shifted or scattered wavefunctions).\nBy combining the continuity equation for the probability density and L'H\u00f4pital's rule,\nimproper energy normalization is defined by\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nZ s2\n1\n+ 2Ic2 (E)\n,\n(22)\nf 2 (x, E)dx = I\u2202E c\n2I\nr\nwhere r is a cut-off radius (and as above, I is assumed to be energy-independent). This\nnormalization is of course arbitrary, since it is governed by c(E), but it conditions the\nenergy-dependence of the different scattering parameters. In particular, the accumulated\nphase, which is unambiguously defined (Eq. (10)) for the eigenfunctions of the SturmLiouville problem, crucially depends (Eq. (11)) on the normalization when E is not an\neigenvalue.\nMore precisely, let us assume the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem to be\ngiven by E0 = \u03be(n), where n is the number of zeros of the corresponding eigenfunction\n(thus, of u2 ), and \u03be(n) is an a-priori arbitrary, but monotonous function admitting a\ndifferentiable inverse, n(E) = \u03be \u22121 (E). The functional relation between E0 and integer\nvalues of n is thereby extended to any energy E lying between two eigenvalues, ie\nE = \u03be(n), n real. The energy-dependence for c(E) can now be chosen so as to extend\nthe normalization of the eigenfunctions to non-integer values of n by equating Eq. (22)\nto I\u03c0\u2202E \u03be \u22121 (E) (cf Eqs. (10) and (12)), yielding\n1\n(23)\nc(E) = \u2212 cot \u03c0\u03be \u22121 (E).\n2I\nSubstituting in Eq. (11) gives the following expression for the accumulated phase:\n\u03c6(s2 , E 6= E0 ) = \u03c0\u03be \u22121(E) \u2261 \u03c0n(E).\n\n(24)\n\n\u00a7 We noted, however, that given the behaviour of the amplitude function at s1 and s2 , there is\nnecessarily a point between t1 and t2 where \u2202x \u03b1 vanishes. The argument sketched here relies on\nthe signs of the basis functions u1 and u2 and their derivatives when V (x) is monotonous on a full\ncycle of oscillation of the basis functions, and excludes the neighbourhood around the bottom of the\npotential, where \u2202x \u03b1 changes sign (but \u2202x \u03b1 does not vanish exactly at the bottom of the potential, as\nwould be the case in the WKB approximation).\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n8\n\nThus the accumulated phase does not oscillate as a function of the energy (it is a simple\nstraight line as a function of n) and the value of c given in Eq. (23) is the only value\ncompatible with energy normalization leading to a non-oscillating accumulated phase\nfunction. We shall mention in Sec. 5.3 below the relation the specific form (24) has\nwith the canonical action variable in classical mechanics. Note finally, that provided\nthe basis functions u1 and u2 are redefined so that their Wronskian is proportional to\n2I sin \u03c0n(E), Eq. (23) becomes a particular form of the more general Eq. (18): with\nsuch a choice, the amplitude \u03b1 is a non-oscillating function of x and the accumulated\nphase \u03c6(s2 ) is a non-oscillating function of E.\n3. Semi-classical Ermakov system\n3.1. Asymptotic solutions to the linear equation\nThe approximate solutions to the one dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation when h\u0304 \u2192 0 are\nwell-known from the asymptotic theory of ordinary linear differential equations [10]. It\nfollows from Sec. 2.3.1 that it is sufficient to consider the solutions between the turning\npoints (ie for real p(x)). Real solutions are of the form\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\na1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsin \u00b1 p(x )dx + a2\n(25)\nue(x) = q\np(x)\n\nwhere a1 and a2 are constants. Tilded (e) quantities will henceforth denote asymptotic\n(semiclassical) functions when these are to be distinguished from the corresponding\nexact quantum solutions. It is well-known from Hamilton-Jacobi theory that\nS(x, E) = \u00b1\n\nZ\n\np(x\u2032 , E)dx\u2032 + a2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere S(x, E) is known as the Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function or reduced action:\nthe characteristics in phase-space are made up of the points (x, \u2202x S).\n3.2. Ermakov system\nBy direct substitution of a general asymptotic solution into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\ne the semiclassical amplitude and phase functions, we obtain a\ne and \u03c6\nand by labeling \u03b1\nsemiclassical Ermakov system\n\"\n\n#\n\nh\u03042\nh\u03042 \u2202x2 ue + p2 (x) +\nhS; xi ue = 0\n2\n\"\n\n#\n\nh\u03042\n+ p (x) +\nh\u0304\nhS; xi\ne\n\u03b1\n2\n2e\n2 \u2202x \u03b1\n\n2\n\n(27)\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\n= h\u03042 \u2202x \u03c6e\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere again the bracket h ; xi denotes a Schwartzian derivative andD we Ehave, as for the\ne and thus \u2202 2 \u03b1/\ne x /2.

(27)\nis the modified Schr\u00f6dinger equation exactly obeyed by the semiclassical wavefunctions,\nand Eq. (28) is the nonlinear equation fulfilled by the semiclassical amplitude function.\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit\n\n9\n\nThe passage from the exact (quantum) Ermakov system to the semiclassical one simply\nconsists in a redefinition of the potential energy function, and is identical if hS; xi\nvanishes. Although generally hS; xi is nonzero (except for the free particle), hS; xi does\ntend to zero or to a finite value in the limit of high quantum numbers (eg the harmonic\noscillator for the former, the centrifugal Coulomb potential for the latter). Only if this\nvalue is negligible compared to the other terms in the energy function does the high\nquantum numbers condition fit with the semiclassical limit.\n3.3. General solutions\ne are given in terms of two independent functions u\ne and \u03c6\ne 1 and u\ne 2 of Eq. (27)\n\u03b1\nby the same relations, Eqs. (8) and (9), as in the exact (quantum) case, with now\nf\ntilded quantities. It is convenient, however, to set the tilded constants ae, Ie and W\nequal to their quantum counterpart a, I and W. This is done by first noting that\ne \u03b1\ne so a\ne sin \u03c6,\ne cos \u03c6],\ne = a = 1. To\nW[\u03b1 sin \u03c6, \u03b1 cos \u03c6] = a, which we then set equal to W[\u03b1\npreserve the Wronskians (cf Eqs. (14)-(15)), the semiclassical function uf1 , of the form\ngiven by Eq. (25), is thus set as\n\nuf1 (x) =\n\ns\n\n2I\nsin S(x),\np(x)\n\n(29)\n\nwhere we have implicitly included a2 in the reduced action so that uf1 is the asymptotic\napproximation to u1 in the neighbourhood of an arbitrary x lying between the turning\nf2 with Wronskian W[u\nf1 , u\nf2 ] = W is then obtained\npoints.

In what\nfollows, we shall set \u03ba = 1, which is tantamount to rescaling u2 (a similar rescaling was\nperformed in the quantum case, see below Eq. (18)).\n3.4. Non-oscillating solutions\ne readily yields\nSubstituting Eqs. (29)-(30) in the expression for \u03b1\nh\n1\ne2 =\n4I 2 W \u22122 sin2 S(x) + (cos S(x) \u2212 2Ic sin S(x))\n\u03b1\np(x)\n\u001a\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00d7 cos S(x) \u2212 2I c + W\n\n\u22121\n\nh\n\n2\n\n4 \u2212 W /I\n\ni\n2 1/2\n\n\u0013\n\nsin S(x)\n\n\u001b\u0015\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is a highly oscillatory function for an arbitrary value of the parameter c. However,\n1/2\nit may be noted by inspection that for c = \u2212 [W \u22122 \u2212 (2I)\u22122 ] , the oscillating terms\nare cancelled out. Remark that this is the same expression that was labelled co in the\ne 2 (co ) = h/p(x),\nquantum case (Eq. (18)). Reestablishing h\u0304, the amplitude now reads \u03b1\nwhich given our assumptions is a non-oscillating function of x. Identical substitutions\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 10\ne from which it follows that the semiclassical phase function is highly\nmay be done for \u03c6,\noscillatory for an arbitrary value of c except if c = co , and in that case,\ne\n\u03c6(x,\nco ) = S(x)/h\u0304.\n\n(32)\n\nIn short, non-oscillating functions are obtained for a unique value of the parameter\nq\nc, for which the semiclassical quantities match their classical counterpart ( h\u0304/p(x)\nand S(x)/h\u0304 are respectively the classical probability amplitude and phase functions).\nWriting Eq.

Note also that p (x) + h\u0304 hS; xi /2 = h\u0304 tan \u03c6(c); x /2 (this is\nestablished by using the M\u00f6bius invariance of the Schwartzian derivative and establishing\ne\na c-dependent linear transformation relating tan \u03c6(x,\nc) to tan S(x)).\n\n4. h\u0304 expansions\n\nThe link between the solutions of the quantum and semiclassical Ermakov systems is\ndone by employing a formal h\u0304 expansion of the amplitude function. As in the previous\nsection, we assume I and W to be identical in both the quantum and the semiclassical\ncase. It is then straightforward to show that to each order in h\u0304 (as well as to infinite\norder), non-oscillatory functions are obtained.\n4.1. Series expansions\nThe formal asymptotic solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for small values of the\nparameter h\u0304 is usually done by transforming it to the Riccati form and then obtaining a\nrecurrence relation between complex function of order j and the functions of lower order\n[10]. Here we proceed slightly differently, because we want the relations between the\namplitude and the phase to be verified to each order. We look for a generic solution of\nEq.

The Wronskian\nrelations are then preserved to each order in h\u0304 , that is\nW[a(x) sin f (x), a(x) cos f (x)] = a20 (x)\u2202x f0 (x) = \u2202x S(x)/p(x) = 1.\n\n(37)\n\nBetween the turning points, the \u00b1 branches are combined to yield real oscillatory\nfunctions.

(39)\n\nTo first order these functions coincide by construction with the semiclassical\nwavefunctions ue1 and ue2 .\n4.2. Amplitude and phase expansions\n\nThe h\u0304 expansions for the amplitude and phase functions are obtained by combining the\nnonlinear superposition principle [Eqs. (8)-(9)] with the formal series expansions for u1\nand u2 . The expansions may be done to finite or infinite order. In the first case, the\nfunctions are Taylor expanded around h\u0304 = 0 after separating the classical terms a0 and\nf0 . The infinite order case is analogous to the first order case treated in Sec. 3.4. For\nexample substituting the series expansions in Eq. (9) gives the expression (mod \u03c0) of\nthe phase which can be simplified as\n(\n\n!\n\n\u0014\n\n\u221e\ni1/2\nh\nS(x) X\n\u03c6(x, c) = arccot cot\n+\nfi (x)h\u0304i\u22121 \u2212 2Ic(E) + IW \u22121 4 \u2212 W 2 /I 2\nh\u0304\ni=1\n\n\u0015)\n\n.(40)\n\nThe amplitude function may be obtained by deriving this last equation, keeping in mind\nthe Wronskian relations (37), yielding an expression involving the sines and cosines of\nthe expression between parentheses in Eq. (40). In both cases, the highly oscillatory\nterms are cancelled by setting c = co (in Eq. (40) for example, the term between square\nbrackets then vanishes).\n5. Discussion\n5.1. General Remarks\nWe have thus seen that same value of c gives rise to non-oscillating functions both in\nthe semiclassical and quantum cases. This is not surprising, if the similarities between\nEqs. (30), (39) and (19) on the one hand, together with the nonlinear superposition\nprinciple in both the quantum and semiclassical Ermakov systems on the other hand\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 12\nare considered: the same functional relation gives the amplitude-phase functions in\nboth cases. We note however that the simple arguments we have given above, although\nphysically appealing because of the direct connection to standard classical quantities, are\nliable to a more rigorous treatment. For example the series expansion obtained for the\namplitude function does not necessarily converge, and even its asymptotic properties\nas a function of the parameter c deserve a more thorough investigation. Actually,\nLewis had made the same remarks when studying the adiabatic invariant series of the\ntime-dependent classical harmonic oscillator in powers of an adiabatic parameter \u03b5 [11],\nwhich is defined by the same uncoupled Ermakov system as the one studied in this\npaper. Lewis's work was the first (albeit implicit) application to Ermakov systems\nof Kruskal's asymptotic theory of Hamiltonian systems extending the study of the\nadiabatic invariants beyond the first order in \u03b5 [12]. The transposition of these theories\nto the present problem is not straightforward because we lack here the Hamiltonian\nformalism on which these theories are based (eg, the integral invariants that appear\nin Kruskal's theory would have here a rather obscure interpretation). Nonetheless, the\npresent results on the oscillatory properties can be directly transposed to any uncoupled\nErmakov system depending on an 'adiabatic' parameter \u03b5 (which in the present context\ncorresponds of course to the Planck constant).\n5.2. Scattering basis functions\nPreviously to the work of Fano et al [13], the use of amplitude-phase methods in\nscattering theory was limited to the high kinetic-energy limit, and the derivatives of\nthe phase \u03c6 above first order neglected, thereby effectively restricting the treatment\nfrom the start to the standard WKB approximation (see eg, Ch. 4.3 of [14]). The\nmore recent application of these methods to define a pair of basis functions for phaseshifted wavefunctions in a potential (as outlined above), relies on numerical treatments\nto minimize the oscillations; these treatments are preferred even in the cases for which\nan analytic pair of basis functions is known, such as the Whittaker functions for\nthe centrifugal Coulomb problem or the parabolic cylinder functions for the harmonic\noscillator. It is interesting to note that the approach suggested in Sec. 2.3 yields, for\nan arbitrary potential with a single minimum, the same relations that are known to be\nvalid (and non-oscillating) for the analytic functions in the mentioned special cases (eg\nin the Coulomb case where the effective quantum number \u03bd is defined by \u03bd = \u03be \u22121 (E)+l,\nthe accumulated phase obtained with the Whittaker functions is \u03c6(\u221e) = \u03c0(\u03bd \u2212 l), and\nimproper normalization follows the normalization of the eigenfunctions by normalizing\nto \u03bd 3 /2, independently of \u03bd being real or an integer [15]).\n\u00bfFrom a formal standpoint, defining a specific basis of functions is equivalent to\ndefining the Green's function of the scattering process in the asymptotic field. This is\nthe Green's function that appears in the Lippmann-Schwinger equations and through\nwhich the collision operators are defined. This is why the collision operators depend on\nthe parameter c. Though at first sight this may appear as an unexpected feature, it must\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 13\nbe remembered that the explicit inclusion of closed channels leads to a modification of\nthe usual Green's functions through a term depending on the accumulated phase [16].\n5.3. Semiclassical limit and classical quantities\nStandard semiclassical physics is usually not concerned by the quantum to classical\nlimiting procedure, because the strategy there is to start from classical quantities at\nthe outset and then proceed to quantization. However, we have seen in Sec. 3 that\nthe classical reduced action is only one of the many phase functions that are obtained\nin the semiclassical limit (namely the non-oscillating one). This type of problem is\nfrequent in 'classicalization' procedures: a particular, often arbitrary choice has to be\nmade to recover classical quantities (action, Liouville equation, etc.) A recent example\nis given in Ref. [17], where the passage from Hilbert-space to classical-phase space\noperators involves particular choices for the parameters in order to recover the classical\ndynamics. In other works, this requirement takes the form of an additional ad-hoc\ncondition usually termed as the 'correspondence principle' (eg in Ref. [18] where\na quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is given an additional boundary\ncondition pquantum (x, E) \u2192 pclassical (x, E) when h\u0304 \u2192 0 and E is fixed)k. Though much\nless general, our treatment is more transparent in that the continuation of the classical\nreduced action in the quantum domain is readily identified: it is the non-oscillating\nphase function (and the continuation of the classical probability amplitude is the nonoscillating amplitude function).\nOther aspects of the classical-quantum correspondence for a classically integrable\nand separable system deserve to be mentioned. The accumulated phase (Eqs. (10)-11))\nis seen to be directly related to the line integral around a closed loop of \u03b1\u22122 :\nI\n\n[\u2202x \u03c6(x, c)] dx = 2\u03c6(s2 , c).\n\nI\n\n[\u2202x \u03c6(x, co )] dx = 2\u03c0n(E).\n\n(41)\n\nContrary to EBK (torus) quantization, there are no caustics when dealing with exact\nH\nquantization, and the quantization condition reads [\u2202x \u03c6(x, c)] dx = 2\u03c0n, ie, n is an\ninteger and the line integral does not depend on the particular value of c. Here we\nunderstand by \"exact quantization\" the quantization of the exact quantum phase, and\nnot the exact WKB quantization of non-solvable potentials, as employed by Voros [19].\nNote however that when c = co , the (unquantized) integral (41) reads, according to Eq.\n(24):\n(42)\n\nNot only does c = co preserve for non-integer real numbers the functional relation valid\nfor exact quantization, but it gives a parameterization of the quantum equivalent of the\ncanonical action variable.\nk Other authors crudely suppress the h\u0304\u2212dependent terms in selected equations where this suppression\nleads to classical relations (for example this would be done in Eq. (4) by giving the amplitude squared\nthe dimensions of a classical quantity, getting thereby rid of \u2202x2 \u03b1, but would not be done in Eq. (3),\nwhich does not support an obvious classical interpretation). This procedure has often been criticized\nbecause the functions and the parameters appearing in the equations depend on h\u0304.\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 14\nIn a similar vein, the period of motion T is given in Hamilton-Jacobi theory\nby taking the energy derivative of the reduced action along the closed loop. The\ntransposition to the phase function in the quantum case would imply taking the\nenergy derivative of Eq. (41), which by Eqs. (11) and (22) is proportional to the\nnormalization. Again, the normalization depends on c(E) and to take \u2202E \u03c6(c) as the\ntime parameterization doesn't appear to make much sense unless c = co , since any other\nvalue would lead to an oscillating function, which would further not collapse to the\nclassical period in the h\u0304 \u2192 0 limit.\n5.4. Example\nWe illustrate the properties mentioned above on the harmonic oscillator, a paradigm\nboth in the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of classical mechanics [20] and in the\nsemiclassical theory of bound states [21]. The reduced action S(x, E) of Eq. (26) is\nreadily obtained, from which it follows that\n\u0010\n\n\u2202x S = 2mE \u2212 m2 \u03c9 2 x2\nJ\u2261\n\nI\n\n\u00111/2\n\n(43)\n\n[\u2202x S] dx = 2\u03c0E/\u03c9,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere m and \u03c9 are the mass and frequency of the oscillator; we slightly depart from\nusual conventions and define J to be the canonical action variable. The period is\nrecovered as T = \u2202E J. The standard WKB solutions between the caustics, Eqs.\n(29)-(30), are obtained from these classical quantities. Semiclassical quantization must\ntake into account the singularities at the turning points, from which it follows that\nE0 = h\u0304\u03c9 (n + 1/2) , with n being an integer.\nQuantum mechanically, the eigenvalues are given by \u03be(n) = h\u0304\u03c9 (n + 1/2) when n is\nan integer that counts the zeros of the eigenfunction, but this relation can be extended for\nany real value of n, as discussed in Sec. 2.3.4. We then write \u03be \u22121 as n(E) = E/h\u0304\u03c9 \u22121/2.\nThe derivative of the exact (quantum) phase is given by Eqs. (7)-(8) as\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u22122\n2I\n1\n4Ic\nm\u03c9\n+ 2Ic2 u21 (x) + 2 u22 (x) \u2212\nu1 (x)u2 (x)\n.(45)\nh\u0304\n2I\nW\nW\nFig. 2 compares the classical conjugate momentum as given by Eq. (43) with two exact\nphases h\u0304\u2202x \u03c6(x, c) obtained from Eq. (45) by using numerical solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation u1 and u2 with respective vanishing boundary conditions at x = \u2212\u221e and\nx = +\u221e. One of the curves is for an arbitrary value of c, the other corresponds to\nc = co . It may be seen that even for a moderate excitation (n \u2248 12), the non-oscillating\nsolution with c = co can barely be distinguished from the classical momentum at the\nsame energy, except near the turning points (the reason is that hS; xi is negligible, hence\nthe exact quantum phase, solution of Eq. (6) tends to the semiclassical quantum phase\n\u03c6e of Eq. (28), which is simply S(x) when c = co ).\nThe analog of the canonical action J appears as the line integral (41), which\nH\ngenerally depends on c except when n is an integer in which case [h\u0304\u2202x \u03c6(x, c)] dx =\n\n\u2202x \u03c6(x, c) =\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 15\n2\u03c0h\u0304n. Thus for the quantized energies, the quantal line integral differs from J by the\nMaslov index. However, if c = co , we have for any E [Eq. (42)]\nI\n\n[h\u0304\u2202x \u03c6(x, co )] dx = 2\u03c0E/\u03c9 \u2212 h\u0304/2,\n\n(46)\n\nwhich is the classical result with an action correction coming from the Maslov index.\nNote that taking the energy derivative of Eq. (41) crucially depends, for any energy E\n(including the eigenvalues) on the energy-dependence c(E). Only the energy dependence\ngiven by the relation (23) above, which yields Eq. (46) in this case, renders the usual\nrelation for the period, and more generally follows the classical time parameterization for\nconservative systems in Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Thus, the parameter c, which appears\nfree within quantum mechanics and has no classical counterpart, must be constrained if\nthe usual classical relations for the oscillator are to be extended to quantum amplitude\nand phase functions.\nThe usual interpretation of the invariant within Ermakov systems hinges on the\nuse of an original Hamiltonian or Lagrangian, from which the Ermakov equations are\nderived. The invariant is then associated, by means of Noether's theorem, with the\nconserved quantity of an auxiliary motion [5, 6]. Such an interpretation is of course not\navailable here, where the Ermakov equations are used in a quantum-mechanical context.\nThe invariant I is employed in this context only to define the normalization, through\nEq. (12). However, for the choice c = co , a further interpretative step may be taken,\nsince then the term on the right hand-side in Eqs. (12) or (22) gives\nI\n\nh\u0304\nI\u2202E [h\u0304\u2202x \u03c6(x, co )] dx.\n(47)\n2m\nFor the harmonic oscillator, we have by Eq. (46) and by adopting unity normalization\nm\u03c9\nI=\n.\n(48)\nh\u0304\u03c0\nFor other systems, I usually depends on n(E) except if the wavefunctions are energynormalized. Elementary manipulations yield the more general form\nI = 2\u03c0\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n\u03bb(x, E)dx\n\n,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere \u03bb(x, E) is the local de Broglie wavelength and the range of integration is restricted\nto the classical domain between the turning points.\n6. Conclusion\nPrevious interest in amplitude-phase methods led us to investigate in this work the\noscillatory properties of the nonlinear equation of uncoupled Ermakov systems. It was\nshown that non-oscillating amplitude-phase functions in the space and energy variables\nhave a particular feature in the semiclassical limit: they yield classical quantities.\nWe have seen that although standard quantum-mechanical quantities, such as the\nwavefunctions or the eigenvalues, are insensitive to the value of the parameter c and its\nenergy dependence, there is a unique value of c which appears as connecting quantum\n\n\fNon-oscillating solutions to uncoupled Ermakov systems and the semiclassical limit 16\namplitude and phase functions to their classical counterpart. Only in this case can\n'quantum characteristics' (x, \u2202x \u03c6) having a sense, and collapsing to (x, \u2202x S) when h\u0304 \u2192 0\nbe defined. We insist again that from the point of view of quantum mechanics, even in\nthe semiclassical limit, this need not be the case: any amplitude and phase functions\nobeying Eq. (33) will yield correct semiclassical wavefunctions. A full study of these\naspects on specific physical systems will be given elsewhere. Further links with current\nwork on Ermakov systems may lead to a better appreciation, as well as to an extension,\nof the formalism.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank T.

Q(co ) (broken line, left scale), \u03b1(co ) (non-oscillating black line) and \u03b1(\u2212co )\n(oscillating grey line) [right scale] are plotted for a harmonic oscillator (atomic units\nand \u03c9 = 1, n(E) = 4.4, see Sec. 5.4 for the definitions). All amplitude functions \u03b1(c)\nfor any c go through the points x1 (triangles), and any function \u1fb1(c\u0304) goes through the\npoints x2 (rectangles). Only the 2 functions \u03b1(\u00b1co ) go through both the points x1 and\nx2 . Since Q oscillates and Q(x = x1,2 , \u00b1co ) = 2I/W 2 is constant, \u2202x Q has opposite\nsigns at x1 and x2 , as may be seen on the figure. This is also the case for \u03b1(\u2212co ) (grey\nline) which therefore oscillates, but not for \u03b1(co ).\n\nFigure 2.
