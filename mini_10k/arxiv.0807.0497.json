INTRODUCTION\nThe recovery of the full theoretical resolution of large ground-based optical telescopes in the presence of atmospheric turbulence has been a major goal of technological developments in the field of astronomical instrumentation in the past decades. The de-facto standard nowadays is adaptive optics, the active real-time correction\nof the incoming distorted wavefronts by means of deformable mirrors. While diffraction limited image quality\ncan now be routinely achieved in the near infrared at large telescopes, this is only possible with considerable\ntechnical effort.\nEven before the age of adaptive optics, speckle interferometric techniques gave access to the diffraction limit\nof large telescopes by applying auto- or cross-correlation methods in Fourier space to large sets of atmospherically\ndegraded short-time exposures.1\u20135\nAn even more simple approach has been employed especially by amateur astronomers in order to produce\nsharp images of the moon or bright planets: instead of using all images of a large set of short-time exposures, only\nthose showing little image distortion due to the variable strength of atmospheric turbulence are combined to a\nhigh-resolution result. Like in the speckle interferometric approach, this requires only a detector with fast readout\ncapability and moderate computational effort. The application of this technique to fainter astronomical targets,\ne.g. low-mass double stars, was limited by the readout noise of the available detectors at visible wavelengths\nuntil a few years ago. At typical exposure times of few ten milliseconds \u2013 necessary to \"freeze\" the effects of\natmospheric turbulence \u2013 photon noise limited detectors are obligatory to use this so-called \"Lucky Imaging\"\ntechnique on targets fainter than \u224810 mag. Since the image quality of each single frame has to be determined,\ne.g. by measuring the Strehl ratio of a reference star, the readout noise of the detector sets stringent limits on\nthe minimum brightness of this reference.\nThe advent of electron multiplying CCDs (EMCCD)6\u20138 led to considerable interest in the Lucky Imaging\ntechnique on the part of professional astronomers. First experiments at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) with\nLuckyCam9\u201312 proved that Lucky Imaging is a very promising alternative to adaptive optics, allowing diffraction\nlimited imaging at telescopes in the 2\u20133 m class at wavelengths below 1\u03bcm. These results triggered the development of a similar instrument for the 2.2-m telescope at Calar Alto by our group. The Lucky Imaging camera\nAstraLux was built in less than 5 months thanks to the availability of most parts as off-the-shelf equipment.\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to F.

Small technical overheads, an easy to use software\ninterface and the availability of pipeline results in near real-time allow the observation of up to 20 targets per\nhour.\nIn the following we describe the instrument design and data processing pipeline and summarise the instrument's performance and key characteristics. Interested readers looking for more comprehensive information are\nreferred to the diploma thesis13\u2020 , which covers AstraLux and its performance in full detail.\n\n2. INSTRUMENT DESIGN\n2.1 Telescope and site characteristics\nThe Calar Alto observatory is located at a height of 2150 m in the Sierra de los Filabres, approximately 50 km\nnorth of Almeria in Andalusia, southern Spain. The median seeing, measured by the site's seeing monitor \u2248300m\naway from the telescope is 0.\u2032\u2032 9, slightly better in summer than in winter.14\nTogether with the given telescope diameter of 2.2 m, the seeing defines the optimal wavelength for Lucky\nImaging: the probability for the occurence of a good frame (i.e. with a Strehl ratio >37%) in a series of short\n\u2020\n\nAvailable online at http://www.mpia.de/ASTRALUX/\n\n\fexposure times images decreases exponentially15 with the ratio of telescope diameter over Fried parameter r0 ,\nwhich again depends inversely on the seeing and scales with \u03bb5/6 . While observations at short wavelengths result\nin too low probabilities for usable frames, the gain in resolution by selecting only high-quality frames becomes\nsmall at long wavelengths due to the decreasing theoretical resolution of the telescope. For the Calar Alto 2.2-m\ntelescope, the optimal wavelength for efficient Lucky Imaging lies in the range of 800\u20131000 nm, including the\nJohnson I and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) i\u2032 and z \u2032 passbands. At typical seeing conditions one can\nexpect that \u22480.5\u20131% of all images will have an acceptable Strehl ratio of few 10% while providing a 6 to 10\ntimes better resolution. A Lucky Imaging instrument for the 3.5-m telescope at the same site would have to\noperate optimally in the H-band \u2013 a wavelength range for which no photon noise limited detectors are available\noff-the-shelf so far.\n\n2.2 Camera & Optics\n2.2.1 Camera Head\nThe AstraLux camera head is an Andor DV887-UVB model from Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nIt is an electron-multiplying, thinned, and back-illuminated 512\u00d7512 pixel CCD that comes as complete package\nwith a multi-stage Peltier cooler, mechanical shutter, computer interface and software. It can be operated with\nreadout clocks of up to 10 MHz in frame transfer mode, allowing a full frame rate of 34 Hz. Using subarrays,\nbinning, and short vertical shift times allows frame rates of more than 1 kHz. These short exposure times are\nrealised by electronic shuttering, whereas the mechanical shutter is only used for bias and dark frame acquisition\nand to protect the CCD window against dust. Starting at room temperature, the typical operating temperature\nof \u221275\u25e6C is usually reached within 10 minutes. The camera requires neither refill of liquid coolants nor any\naction to maintain the vacuum inside the CCD head. The quantum efficiency (QE) of the E2V CCD97 detector\npeaks at >90% in the R band. At 912 nm, the central wavelength of the SDSS z \u2032 filter, the QE is still \u224840%.\nThe camera can be used either as conventional CCD without electron multiplication, or as EMCCD with\nmultiplication gains of up to 2500 at \u221275\u25e6 C. The electron gain is set from within the control software with a\nresolution of 255 steps, unfortunately not linearly related to the actual physical electron gain\u2021 . For Lucky Imaging\nwe use a readout clock of 10 MHz with 14 Bit A/D resolution. The readout noise is \u224880e\u2212 . At an electron gain\nof 2500, this corresponds to a SNR of >30 for single photons. So called clock-induced charges (CIC), spurious\nevents caused during vertical clocking in the sensor or frame transfer area, occur with a probability of \u22485%\nat a vertical shift time of 1.8\u03bcs. The CIC probability strongly depends on the shift time and the applied shift\nvoltage. Both parameters can be varied via the control software, but it is not recommended to deviate from the\nadopted standard settings. Not only the CIC probability, but also the charge transfer efficiency depends on these\nparameters. At full electron gain, the camera is linear to up to 70 photons per pixel, or 170000 with disabled\nelectron gain.\n2.2.2 Barlow Lens\nAt the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope, the camera's physical pixel size of 16 \u03bcm roughly corresponds to almost twice\nthe size of the theoretical PSF at 912 nm (SDSS z \u2032 band). Diffraction limited imaging is thus not possible without\nsome kind of magnification optics that increases the effective focal length. Proper sampling in the sense of the\nNyquist criterion can only be reached with a magnification factor of 5 in SDSS z \u2032 , and even larger factors are\nnecessary for observations at shorter wavelengths. However, for the final design, a value of 4 was adopted as\na good compromise between spatial sampling and the size of the field of view which is 24\u00d724\u2032\u2032 at a pixel scale\nof 47 mas/px. The hardware realisation chosen for the AstraLux instrument is a single negative achromat in\nBarlow configuration, i.e. placed in the optical path before the nominal focal plane of the telescope.\nThe AstraLux Barlow lens is a Thorlabs ACN127-030-B achromat with a diameter of d=12.7 mm and a focal\nlength of f =\u221230 mm. It is optimised and coated for the wavelength range 650\u22121050 nm. The lens provides\ndiffraction limited image quality over the full field of view and the whole specified wavelength range. Field\ndistortion of up to 0.5% is the result of using a lens with such a short focal length in a non-telecentric configuration.\nThough this poses an instrumental limit to the astrometric accuracy if it is not properly calibrated, it allows a\n\u2021\n\nNewer models of Andor EMCCDs allow a direct, calibrated setting of the EM gain.\n\n\fvery compact and rigid construction of the fore-optics.\nThe lens is held in a standard C-mount tube \u2013 bought \"off-the-shelf\" like the lens itself \u2013 that is mounted directly\non the camera. This guarantees a high stability of the pixel scale, which strongly depends on the distance between\nlens and CCD. Tolerances for tilt and de-centre of the lens were found to be 2\u25e6 and 1 mm, respectively, referring\nto a geometric spot pattern size smaller than the diffraction limited PSF. The direct connection between camera\nand lens tube helps to achieve a good alignment, and eases dis- and reassembly of the camera system.\n2.2.3 Filters\nFor operations at the Calar Alto 2.2 m telescope it was decided to refurbish the so-called Instrumenansatz 1\n(IA1), an adapter that was used for mounting conventional CCDs in the past . This device can be mounted\nbehind the video guider unit at the Cassegrain focus of the telescope and includes a filter wheel with 8 positions.\nThis wheel can hold virtually any filter that is available at the observatory\u00a7, allowing observations at a wide\nrange of wavelengths. The filter wheel control electronics is located in the electronics rack at the mirror cell, and\nthe wheel is controlled via a graphical user interface on the camera control computer.\nThe standard filters used for Lucky Imaging observations are SDSS i\u2032 and z \u2032 band interference filters, manufactured by Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The filter transmission curves are very close to the original\nSDSS filter system definition16 and peak at more than 95% transmission.\n\n2.3 Instrument Control\nAstraLux can be controlled from virtually any point of the observatory with a 100 MBit Ethernet network\nconnection. The user connects via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a standard PC workstation that serves as\ngateway to the camera control computer. This control computer, also a standard PC, is located in the electronics\nrack at the mirror cell and exclusively used to run the original camera control software supplied by the vendor\nand a simple user interface for filter wheel control.\nThe camera control software offers a real time display and allows setting of all crucial parameters like exposure\ntime, electron gain, or number of requested frames. The raw FITS data cubes (typically 18 MB/s at maximum\nframe rate) are not stored on the camera computer itself, but on a fast RAID-0 array with 1 TB capacity in the\ngateway machine.\n\n2.4 Data Processing & Storage\nThe AstraLux data reduction software is running on a dedicated pipeline computer, equipped with two dualcore Woodcrest processors and 8 GB of memory. Upon completion of an observation, the pipeline machine\nautomatically fetches the raw data from the primary storage RAID array and starts data processing. Telescope\nand environmental parameters are retrieved from the Calar Alto database. The pipeline then automatically\nproduces quicklook results of the Lucky Imaging observations in approximately the same time that is needed for\ndata acquisition. The basic pipeline algorithms are similar to that adopted by the LuckyCam team.17, 18\nAt the end of the observing night, complete sets of raw data exist on the gateway machine as well as on the\npipeline computer. Backup is started in the morning, preferrably to an external USB harddisk, to be supplied\nby the observer. Up to 400 GB of raw data are produced in a typical winter night, while the pipeline results need\nonly \u22482 GB of disk space.\n2.4.1 Calibration Data Processing\nBoth bias and flatfield cubes are combined to master calibration images using a kappa-sigma clipping algorithm.\nIn the case of flatfield images acquired through the conventional amplifier without electron multiplication, this\nwill prevent cosmics from appearing in the final product. Since bias frames are usually acquired with the same\ncamera parameters as the corresponding science observation, i.e. at high electron gains, they will most likely\nbe contaminated by clock induced charges (CICs). With typically 50\u2212100 single frames in a bias cube, these\nbackground events are removed by kappa-sigma clipping as well. All master calibration files are part of the final\nset of pipeline products.\n\u00a7\n\nSee http://www.caha.es//CAHA/Instruments/filterlist.html for a list of all available filters.\n\n\fWDS 14139+2906\n\nWDS 15420+0027\n\n1\u02bc\u02bc\nN\na)\n\nb)\n\nE\n\nFigure 2. AstraLux first light double stars: the binary WDS 14139+2906 with an angular separation of 0.\u2032\u2032 52 and\ncomponent magnitudes V=7.5 and V=7.6 mag, and the 0.\u2032\u2032 23 separated binary WDS 15420+0027 with V=8.2 and\nV=8.8\u1e41ag component brightnesses. Both images are based on a 2%-selection from 10000 single frames in the SDSS z'\nfilter with 30 ms exposure time each. Image scaling is linear.\n\nFigure 3. Comparison between seeing limited imaging and the \"Lucky\" version: The combination of the best 5% of 10000\nsingle frames provided a Strehl ratio of 20% in this observation of the core of the globular cluster M15. Though the\nconventional result contains 20 times more photons, it is clearly inferior in terms of point source detection limits.\n\n2.4.2 Lucky Imaging Data Processing\nFirst, the position of a suitable reference object for quality assessment has to be determined. This is performed\non a stacked image of the first 2 seconds of raw data, and can be done either manually or automatically. While the\nmanual option allows to select any star just by clicking on the image, the automatic reference finding algorithm\nwill always choose the brightest object in the field of view. The pipeline tracks the reference on all following raw\ndata frames to account for large atmospheric tip/tilt or telescope tracking errors.\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\nM15, 15ms\nM15, 30ms\nM15, 60ms\nM13, 30ms\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\n\u03b8e = 40 arcsec\n\n0.5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c4e = 36ms\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0\n\nIntensity autocorrelation\n\n0.8\nIntensity correlation\n\nNormalised Strehl\n\n0.9\n\nFit\n\n15\n\n20\n\nDistance from reference / arcsec\n\n25\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTime difference / ms\n\nFigure 4.

The given isoplanatic angle of \u03b8e =40\u2032\u2032 was derived by fitting a Moffat profile (solid line).\nRight: Normalised temporal autocorrelation function of the focal plane intensity. The data was fitted with a Lorentzian\nprofile, resulting in an estimated speckle coherence time of \u03c4e =36 ms.\n\nSubsequently, the quality of each single frame is determined by measuring the Strehl ratio of a reference\nobject. A small region with a size of typically 32\u00d732 pixel around the reference source is extracted, resampled\nby a factor of four, and noise-filtered. The resampling serves two purposes. Firstly, since the position of the\nbrightest pixel of the reference object's PSF will be used as input to the image reconstruction algorithm, subpixel shifting can only work if the reference position is determined on resampled images. Secondly, the resampled\nimages allow better estimates of the Strehl ratio. The Strehl value is derived from measurements of the ratio\nbetween peak flux and total flux of the reference object \u2013 a simple and fast method. Unfortunately, the peak\nflux in the slightly undersampled AstraLux images depends on the precise position of the PSF peak within\nthe brightest pixel, while the total flux is independent of the reference object's position. Simulations with the\nAstraLux pixel scale of \u224847 mas showed that Strehl measurements of a perfect PSF would suffer from a jitter of\nup to 20%. This jitter can be reduced to 1% and less by resampling the data before measuring the Strehl ratio.\nIf the data is not only resampled, but also filtered with the telescope's modulation transfer function (MTF), the\nresampling will not introduce additional noise and single-pixel events like CICs and dark current electrons can\nbe suppressed.\nThe pipeline's image reconstruction module performs data reduction in its literal sense. From typically\nseveral GB of input data, just a few MB of pipeline results are produced. The most interesting ones \u2013 the Lucky\nImaging results \u2013 are currently generated with the Drizzle algorithm.19 This linear reconstruction method is flux\npreserving and able to at least partially overcome the slight undersampling that is present in the raw data. It\nis capable of handling sub-pixel translations without the need to perform image shifting in the Fourier domain.\nThe current IDL implementation of the Drizzle algorithm is somewhat simplified and does not consider image\nrotation or field distortions, but just shifts the selected images such that the brightest pixel of the reference\nstar is always positioned at the same pixel coordinates. The drizzling process oversamples the input data twice,\nresulting in a pixel scale of \u224823.7 mas/px in the final images. Currently the pipeline produces drizzled results\nof the best 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% of the input frames. Bias and flatfield calibration frames are applied to the input\nimages prior to drizzling. A seeing (and tracking) limited image is generated as well using all frames to allow\nquick measurements of the seeing conditions, useful at times when the observatory's seeing monitor is switched\noff, or for later assessment of the data quality.\n\n\f0.24\n\n0\n\nV-Band Seeing 0.85 arcsec\nV-Band Seeing 0.60 arcsec\n\n0.22\n\nMagnitude difference\n\n0.2\n\nStrehl Ratio\n\n0.18\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n\n2\n3\n\n5\u03c3 peak detection\n\n4\n\nSDSS z'\n5% selection\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nStrehl vs. reference magnitude\n\n0.06\n\nSeeing 0.7\"\nSeeing 0.8\"\nSeeing 1.0\"\n\n1\n\n9\n\n0.04\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nReference star I-band magnitude\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nDistance from primary / arcsec\n\nFigure 5. Left: Dependency of the final Strehl ratio on natural seeing and reference star magnitude. The plot is based\non observations with 30 ms single frame exposure time in the SDSS z' filter and 1% image selection rate. All Strehl ratios\nwere measured on stars with less than 2\u2032\u2032 separation from the reference star.\nRight: Achievable magnitude differences for a 5\u03c3 peak detection of a fainter companion to the reference star. All curves\nrefer to a 5% selection rate from 10000 images with 30 ms single frame exposure time, equivalent to an effective integration\ntime of 15 s. The I-band magnitude of all three reference stars was \u224810 mag.\n\n3. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE\nFirst light at the Calar Alto 2.2-m telescope was obtained on July 6, 2006. From a total of 5 nights during the\nfirst observing run, only half a night was lost due to bad weather, and the remaining time provided photometric\nsky conditions with V-band seeing values as low as 0.\u2032\u2032 6.\nKnown bright double stars were chosen as first light targets and observed in the SDSS z' band with resulting\nStrehl ratios of \u224820% (see Figure 2). Operating the instrument, and especially acquiring targets, proved to be\nmuch easier than anticipated. Though the pointing accuracy of the telescope is in general not better than 10\u2032\u2032 ,\nthe availability of the camera's real time display allows short acquisition times of typically 1\u20132 min per target.\nAstraLux observations of globular cluster centres enabled the characterisation of the image quality over the\nfull field of view. Choosing different stars with a wide range of magnitudes as the Lucky Imaging reference\nallowed to estimate brightness limits for the reference selection and to measure the dependency of the Strehl\nratio on the reference magnitude. Among the globular clusters M3, M13, and M15, the latter has been observed\nmost extensively with AstraLux. Figure 3 shows a comparison of a Lucky Imaging result to the corresponding\nseeing limited image.\nAstronomical observations with AstraLux started right during the very first night at the telescope, leading\nto two refereed publications so far.20, 21 Completed and ongoing observing programs cover a wide range of target\ntypes, e.g. young stars in nearby moving groups, low-mass binaries, T Tauri binaries, transition disk objects,\nminor planets, and microquasars.\n\n3.1 Isoplanatic Angle and Coherence Time\nIn the following, the isoplanatic angle \u03b8e is defined as the angular separation from the reference star, where the\nobserved Strehl ratio drops to the fraction 1/e of the reference star's Strehl ratio. The observations of centres\nof the globular clusters M13 and M15 allowed measurements of the Strehl ratio for a large number of stars, well\ndistributed over the field of view. Figure 4 shows the normalised Strehl ratios, i.e. the measured Strehl ratios\ndivided by the reference Strehl, for three different M15 and one M13 observation. The images used for this plot\nare based on a 1% selection from 10000 frames in the SDSS z \u2032 band. M15 was observed with three different\nsingle frame exposure times, without a significant impact on the normalised Strehl ratios. The absolute Strehl\nratio slightly decreases with increasing exposure time, though, dropping from \u224822% at 15 ms to 18% at 60 ms.\n\n\fA Moffat profile was fitted to the data, allowing extrapolation to the 1/e point, and hence an estimate of the\nisoplanatic angle \u03b8e . For the SDSS z \u2032 band observations, \u03b8e has been found to be \u224840\u2032\u2032 , larger than the diagonal\nfield of view size of 34\u2032\u2032 .\nThis measurement has been repeated for an observation of M15 in the Johnson I band. No significant\ndifference to the isoplanatic angle extrapolated from the z \u2032 band data was found. Theory predicts a decrease of\n\u03b8e by a factor 1.05 when switching from z \u2032 to I-band, too small to be reliably detected in the available data. The\nexpected isoplanatic angle in V -band is \u22482-5\u2032\u2032 equivalent to \u22484-10\u2032\u2032 in the z \u2032 -band, but the isoplanatic angle in\nspeckle observations is typically about 1.7 times larger.22 The AstraLux data and comparable measurements at\nthe NOT17 suggest that the selection process of the Lucky Imaging technique can further increase \u03b8e to values\nas large as 40\u221250\u2032\u2032.\nTo determine the speckle pattern coherence time, a series of 10000 images of the bright star \u03b2 And was\nrecorded with a time resolution of 4.6 ms. The normalised temporal autocorrelation function is shown in Figure 4\n(right side). The measured coherence time \u03c4e =36 ms corresponds to the 1/e point of a Lorentzian fit.\n\n3.2 Limiting Magnitudes\nThe M13 and M15 observations were re-analysed with different choices of the Lucky Imaging reference star to\nassess the impact of the reference magnitude on the final Strehl ratio. Figure 5 shows the results for measurements\nunder two different seeing conditions. While reference stars as faint as I=15.5 mag still allow a substantial\nimprovement of image quality under a 0.\u2032\u2032 65 seeing, the same performance cannot be reached with stars fainter\nthan 13.5 mag in 0.\u2032\u2032 85 seeing.\nAnother important number, especially in the context of binarity surveys, is the achievable contrast ratio\nor magnitude difference for close companions to bright host stars. This parameter was determined on final\npipeline results of SDSS z \u2032 band observations under different seeing conditions. All observed stars had an I-band\nmagnitude of \u224810 mag. The achievable magnitude differences for a 5\u03c3 peak detection are based on measurements\nof the noise in concentric rings around these stars. This method suffers from the low number of available pixels\nin the innermost 100 mas, but is quite robust at larger angular separations. Simulations with observed PSFs\nwere carried out to check the reliability of the numerical results.\nFigure 5 shows typical detection limit plots for three different V -band seeing values. At angular separations\nlarger than 2\u2032\u2032 , the detection limit is determined by readout noise and the Poisson noise of the sky background.\nUsing more input images, i.e. increasing the effective exposure time of the Lucky Imaging result, will increase\nthe maximum achievable magnitude difference at large separations.\n\nTheoretical\nSeeing limited\n1% selection\n10% selection\n50% selection\n100% selection\n\nNormalised peak flux\n\n1\nNormalised peak flux\n\n\u03c8 Ser PSF profile\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nseeing 0.60\"\nseeing 0.75\"\nseeing 0.90\"\nseeing 1.10\"\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-1000\n\n0.8\n\nSDSS z'\n1% selection\n\n-500\n\n0\nRadius / milli-arcsec\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n0\n-1000 -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 800 1000\nRadius / milli-arcsec\n\nFigure 6.

Fit residuals for the application of the model described by Equation 1 to the radial profiles of the \u03c8 Ser\nobservations. The residuals are given in percent of the peak flux value.\n\n3.3 Point Spread Function Characteristics\nIn the absence of atmospheric dispersion effects, the Lucky Imaging point spread function (PSF) of the AstraLux\ninstrument shows a remarkable radial symmetry\u00b6 . There are no long-lived speckles like they are frequently\nobserved in adaptive optics images. Using a sufficiently large number of input images \u2013 typically several thousand\n\u2013 efficiently averages out asymmetries. For the quantitative assessment of the PSF shape, it is therefore sufficient\nto consider the radially averaged profile only.\nThe left side of Figure 6 shows the radial PSF profile of \u03c8 Ser, observed under a V -band seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 75 with\n15 ms single frame exposure time through the SDSS z \u2032 filter. The profile is plotted for a range of selection rates\nfrom the 10000 input images. The theoretical and seeing limited PSF profiles are overlayed for comparison. The\nprofile of the theoretical PSF was derived from a simulated diffraction limited image with 2.237 mas/px pixel scale,\nwhereas the raw observational data was sampled with \u224846.6 mas/px. Though the Drizzle process of the pipeline\nresulted in a final pixel scale of 23.3 mas/px, principally providing proper sampling in the sense of Nyquist, this is\nnot sufficient to reconstruct a perfect PSF even in the absence of any aberrations due to atmospheric turbulence\nor telescope imperfections. However, for the judgement of image quality and the measurement of Strehl ratios,\nonly the perfectly sampled PSF will be considered throughout this chapter.\nTo calculate the Strehl ratios, all radial profiles were interpolated on a common two-dimensional radius grid\nand numerically integrated to derive the total flux. The Pseudo-Strehl, i.e. the ratio of peak flux over total flux,\nwas calculated for each profile, and divided by the Pseudo-Strehl of the theoretical PSF to obtain the real Strehl\nratio. Since the radial profile of a source can be reliably reconstructed in the presence of a nearby companion or\nin a crowded field, this method results in more robust estimates of the total source flux \u2013 and hence Strehl ratio\n\u2013 than standard aperture photometry.\nAn increase of the selection rate causes only moderate broadening of the PSF core's FWHM, but a stronger\ndecrease of the resulting Strehl ratio due to more pronounced PSF wings. Even at only 1% selection rate, the\nFWHM is considerably larger than theoretically expected. This is probably a result of the slight undersampling\nof the raw data. Simulations have shown that with the current setup and pipeline algorithms, the best FWHM\nto be expected is \u224895 mas.\nIn a next step, the radial profiles of single stars were extracted from observational data over a range of seeing\nconditions. While a Strehl ratio of more than 15% can be reached under a V -band seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 75 and better, it\nrapidly drops to a few percent if the seeing gets worse than 1\u2032\u2032 . The radial profiles for a selection rate of 1% in\nthe SDSS z \u2032 band and a single frame integration time of 15 ms are plotted in Figure 6 for four different seeing\nvalues. As in the case of larger selection rates, an increase of the natural seeing leads in the first instance to\nmore pronounced PSF wings and has only moderate effects on the FWHM of the PSF core.\n\u00b6\n\nOnly in one observing run in 2007 we observed static coma-like aberrations, probably related to a position-dependent\ntilt of the primary mirror.\n\n\f3.4 PSF Modelling\nThe additional broadening of the Lucky Imaging PSF core and the wings of the radial profiles can be modelled\nquite accurately as the weighted sum of a broad Moffat profile and a theoretical PSF that was convolved with a\nGaussian:\nPSFobs (r) = W\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n2 +1\nr2 /\u03c3m\n\n\u0013\u03b2\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nr2\n+ (1 \u2212 W ) PSFth (r) \u2217 exp \u2212 2\n2\u03c3g\n\n(1)\n\nHere, W weights the two PSF components, \u03b2 is the Moffat power law index, and \u03c3g and \u03c3m define the widths\nof the Gaussian and Moffat profile, respectively. PSFobs and PSFth refer to the observed and theoretical radial\nPSF profiles. This semi-analytical model has been applied to the \u03c8 Ser data presented above. The resulting fit\nparameters are given in Table 1, whereas Figure 7 shows the residuals.\nTable 1. Semi-analytical PSF fit parameters for the \u03c8 Ser observations.\n\nSelection rate\n\nW\n\n\u03c3g [mas]\n\n\u03c3m [mas]\n\n\u03b2\n\n1%\n10%\n50%\n\n0.25\n0.31\n0.36\n\n23.8\n24.4\n24.7\n\n250\n270\n300\n\n1.62\n1.61\n1.63\n\nWhile the weighting factor and the width of the Moffat profile vary considerably under changing selection\npercentages, the Moffat power law index and the width of the Gaussian convolution kernel keep nearly constant.\nThe possibility to reconstruct the observed PSF profile from the known theoretical PSF and only two model\nparameters is particularly interesting for binary fitting and PSF subtraction applications. In larger fields, the\ndependency of the model parameters on the source position could be determined, allowing PSF based photometry\nin crowded fields like globular cluster centres.\nFigure 7 shows that the available theoretical PSF does not reproduce the second diffraction ring correctly, leaving\nresiduals of up to 0.5% at \u2248230 mas distance from the PSF centre. This is possibly related to the method used for\nPSF simulation. Currently, the theoretical PSFs are computed for a circular aperture with central obstruction\nby the secondary mirror, but do not include any contributions from the secondary spider or any optics behind\nthe primary mirror.\nThe described model has been applied only in its radial symmetric form so far. Further developments could\ninclude asymmetries due to atmospheric dispersion, and it might be investigated if and how accurately the model\nparameters can be predicted based on the seeing-limited PSF only.\n\n3.5 Performance summary\nAstraLux is able to reach Strehl ratios as high as 25% at the Calar Alto 2.2-m telescope in the z' band. While\nthis is only possible under a superior seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 6 or better, the median Calar Alto seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 9 still allows to\nachieve Strehl ratios of more than 10%. The typical seeing limited Strehl ratio in SDSS z' under such conditions is\n\u22481.1%. In general, Lucky Imaging provides an improvement of the Strehl ratio by a factor of 10, corresponding\nto an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio for point sources by a factor of 10\u221220, depending on atmospheric\nconditions. Thus a selection of only the best 5\u221210% of all images does definitely not have a negative effect on\nthe detection limit for point sources.\nThe requirements for the reference star magnitude are similar as for observations with adaptive optics. The\nperformance starts to significantly decrease at I=14 mag, but image quality improvements are still possible with\nstars as faint as 15\u221216 mag. The measured isoplanatic angle in I-band is with \u224840\u2032\u2032 as large as typical values\nin K-band for adaptive optics observations. Lucky Imaging performs considerably better than speckle imaging\ntechniques. The typical magnitude limit for these methods is V \u224812 mag, and the isoplanatic angle in I-band is\nonly half as large.\nThe measured close companion detection limit at an angular separation of 1\u2032\u2032 is on average 6 mag. This is\nworse compared to the performance of AO systems \u2013 here usually 8\u221210 mag are reached and even more can be\n\n\fexpected from future AO systems with larger actuator numbers. But: adaptive optics at 8-m class telescopes\ncurrently provides this capability only in the H and K-band at wavelengths >1.5 \u03bcm. The achievable contrast\nratio in speckle imaging observations is typically two magnitudes less than for Lucky Imaging.\nSingle frame exposures are limited to integration times below the speckle coherence time of typically 30\u201340 ms\nin SDSS z \u2032 . Like the size of the isoplanatic angle, this number shows seasonal variations and depends on the\nnatural seeing conditions.\nOur measurements indicate that AstraLux is comparable to LuckyCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope in\nterms of limiting magnitude and isoplanatic angle. Detector, optics, electronics, and software worked as expected.\nThe simple design of the instrument certainly contributed to a smooth and satisfactory start of observations at\nCalar Alto.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nWithin less than one year it was possible to design, build, and characterise a Lucky Imaging instrument for\nthe Calar Alto 2.2-m telescope. Beyond evaluation of the observing technique and data reduction strategies,\nscientific observations commenced right in the first night at the telescope. As a common user instrument from\n2007 on, AstraLux has become the standard tool for diffraction limited imaging at the Calar Alto observatory.\nIt is currently mostly used for binarity surveys among stars and minor planets.\nThe encouraging results regarding both development speed as well as scientific output triggered the start of\nthe project \"AstraLux Sur\", an almost identical copy of the Calar Alto version to be used as visitor instrument\nat ESO's New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, Chile. AstraLux Sur is currently on its way to Chile\nafter a development time of less than 2 months and will have first light in mid-July 2008.\nApart from Lucky Imaging, AstraLux can be used as a high speed photometer with single photon detection\ncapability. In combination with the custom GPS timing hardware MicroLux23 it has been successfully used for\nobservations of the optical pulse profile of the Crab pulsar.\nWe are currently investigating possible improvements of the optical design, namely a telecentric magnification\noptics and a tunable atmospheric dispersion corrector. However, the strength of the current system is its simple\ndesign, leading to short development times, low hardware costs, and high stability.\nAn ambitious project for the future would be the combination of AstraLux with a low-order adaptive optics\nsystem, currently developed for the Calar Alto 2.2-m telescope. This could enable observations at shorter\nwavelengths or increase the resulting Strehl ratio under seeing conditions normally unfavourable for Lucky\nImaging. It has recently been proven at the 5-m Palomar telescope24 that this approach actually works and can\nboost the performance of the Lucky Imaging technique.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are particulary grateful to Armin B\u00f6hm, Jens Helmling, and Uli Thiele as well as all technical staff at Calar\nAlto and MPIA for their help in preparing and commissioning AstraLux.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Labeyrie, A., \"Attainment of diffraction limited resolution in large telescopes by fourier analysing speckle\npatterns in star images,\" A&A 6, 85 (1970).\n[2] Labeyrie, A., \"Speckle interferometry and possible extensions,\" A&AS 15, 463 (1974).\n[3] Knox, K.
