Therefore,\n\u03b7 \u2032 is an excellent probe of the Color Glass Condensate.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe \u03b7 \u2032 meson has many interesting properties, the most discussed being its unusual\nmass. By spontaneously breaking U(3) symmetry of the hadronic Lagrangian, one\nwould expect that \u03b7 \u2032 would be a Goldstone boson whose finite mass is due to the\nfinite mass of the quarks. In reality, the \u03b7 \u2032 mass (M = 0.958 GeV) is much heavier\nthan the mass of the \u03b7 (M\u03b7 = 0.547 GeV).

In fact, the singlet mass M0 is smaller than\nthe octet mass M8 . Therefore, in the zero quark mass limit, about half of the \u03b7 \u2032\nmass remains while the octet pseudo-scalar meson (\u03c0, K, \u03b7) masses go to zero.\nThe resolution of this UA (1) problem was provided by 't Hooft [1] and Witten\n[2]. In these works, it was argued that the anomalously large mass of \u03b7 \u2032 is due to\nthe mixing of the gluon state with the flavor-singlet quark state through the axial\nanomaly\n\u2202 \u03bc J\u03bc5 = 2i\n\nX\n\nmf q\u0304f \u03b35 qf + 2Nf\n\nf\n\nD\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng2\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTr\nG\nG\u0303\n\u03bc\u03bd\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(3)\n\nE\n\nwith non-vanishing GG\u0303 . This implies that the \u03b7 \u2032 mesons have a large glue content.\nIt also implies that the gluon fusion process gg \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 is possible.\nIn this paper, we study the generation of \u03b7 \u2032 mesons from such a gluon fusion\nprocess in proton-nucleus '(pA)' collisions. In particular, we argue that measuring\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 meson momentum spectrum enables us to have a direct access to the gluon\ndensity in the small x region of the heavy nucleus. This is made possible by using a\nrecently proposed effective vertex by Atwood and Soni [3] between gluons and the\n\u03b7 \u2032 meson.\nIn [3], as a step to explain an anomalously large B to \u03b7 \u2032 branching fraction, the\nauthors wrote down a Wess-Zumino-Witten type of effective vertex:\nT\u03bb\u03b3 \u03b4 ab = H(p2 , q 2 , P 2) \u03b4 ab \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 p\u03bc q \u03bd (\u01eb\u03b1p )\u03bb (\u01eb\u03b2q )\u03b3\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\froughly corresponding to an interaction Lagrangian of the form L \u223c \u03b7 \u2032 GG\u0303. Here,\np, q are the gluons momenta, \u01eb\u03b1,\u03b2\np,q are the associated polarization vectors, and the\n\u03b4 ab denotes the singlet combination of the gluons. From now on, we denote the \u03b7 \u2032\nmomentum by a capital letter P . The factor H(p2 , q 2 , P 2 ) is a form factor. By\nanalyzing J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 process, the authors of [3] then estimate that in the on-shell\nlimit\nH0 \u2261 H(0, 0, M 2 ) \u2248 1.8 GeV\u22121\n\n(5)\n\nwhere M = 0.958 GeV is the mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson. This vertex was then used to\nanalyze the B-boson decay to \u03b7 \u2032 assuming that the p2 and q 2 dependence of H is\nweak1 . This form of effective vertex has been also confirmed by a calculation of the\ntriangle diagram contribution to the axial anomaly [5].\nThe above effective vertex represents a hadronization matrix element between\na two-gluon state and a hadron state. To the authors' knowledge, this is unique.\nCertainly, many constituent quark models can relate valence quarks to hadrons.\nHowever, except for the above gg\u03b7 \u2032 effective vertex, there is no other known matrix\nelement between the gluons and a known hadron state. We also note that the\nmomenta involved in this process is not so soft compared to \u039bQCD or the pion mass\nsince the \u03b7 \u2032 mass is almost 1 GeV.\nRecently, these interesting features of the gg\u03b7 \u2032 vertex were exploited to calculate\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 production from a hadronizing quark-gluon plasma [6]. In that study, a\nBoltzmann equation was used to evolve the \u03b7 \u2032 density towards the hadronization\ntime in heavy ion collisions. To use the gg\u03b7 \u2032 vertex in this 'AA' environment, a\ncertain set of assumptions had to be made. These assumptions mainly involve the\nas-yet-unknown in-medium properties of the particles and vertices involved in the\ncalculation.\nIn this paper, we focus on production of \u03b7 \u2032 in pA collisions for two reasons. First,\nmuch is known about the structure of proton from DIS experiments at HERA and\nelsewhere [7]. Assuming that we understand the parton distributions in a proton,\npA experiments are an excellent tool with which to investigate parton distributions\nof nuclei at small x. This becomes even more important in light of the fact that\nnot much is known about modification of parton distributions in nuclei at small\n1\n\nThis weak dependence assumption has been questioned by Kagan and Petrov [4] who argued\nthat when one of the gluon momenta is off-shell, the form factor has to be replaced by\nH(q 2 , p2 , M 2 ) \u2248 H0 M 2 /(M 2 \u2212 q 2 ) .\nHowever, this is not relevant to the present study.\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fx and intermediate Q2 since all existing fixed target eA experiments have limited\ncoverage in x and Q2 [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. This region of small x and intermediate\nQ2 (\u223c 1 \u2212 10 GeV2 ) is the domain of high gluon density QCD and semi-hard physics\nwhere interesting phenomena such as saturation of gluons, etc. are expected to\noccur. pA experiments will give us a new venue, in addition to eA and AA, in which\nto investigate the high gluon density phase of QCD.\nAlso, pA collisions are much cleaner than AA in the sense that one can avoid\nmany of the complications due to the in-medium effects. We do not expect to have\na Quark Gluon Plasma (or a hot hadronic phase) created in pA collisions and can\ntherefore avoid the difficulties associated with understanding the possible formation\nof plasma and its detailed properties. In this work, we will show how one can extract\nthe nuclear gluon distribution function at small x from pA experiments at RHIC\nassuming one knows the gluon distribution function in a proton at not too small\nvalues (O(x \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.01)).\nIt should be noted that even though our experimental knowledge of the parton\ndistribution functions in a proton is good, due mostly to HERA, in some pp induced\nprocesses such as pp \u2192 \u03b3X or pp \u2192 \u03c0X, it is quite common to introduce an\n\"intrinsic\" momentum hkt2 i into the standard parton distribution functions in order\nto fit the experimental data [13]. For example,\n2\n\nxG(x, Q ) =\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n2\n\nd kt xG(x, Q\n\n, kt2 )\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\nd2 kt xG(x, Q2 ) f (kt2 )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f (kt2 ) is usually taken to be a Gaussian with width hkt2 i. More explicitly,\nf (kt2 )\n\n1\nkt2\n=\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03c0 hkt2 i\nhkt2 i\n\n!\n\n(8)\n\nso that d2 kt f (kt2 ) = 1. The value of hkt2 i is extracted from best fits to experimental\ndata on dileptons, dijets, etc. and can be as large as 1 \u2212 5 GeV2 at the Tevatron.\nIts value depends also on the energy of the collision and the process considered and\nis expected to be smaller for production of heavier particles.\nThe origin of this \"intrinsic momentum\" is mostly initial state radiation of soft\ngluons. A rigorous investigation of these soft emissions has been carried out in some\nprocesses, such as dilepton production, which effectively introduces this \"intrinsic\"\nmomentum into the standard collinear factorization based cross sections [14]. In\naddition to the \"intrinsic\" momentum due to the initial state radiation, there is a\ngenuine non-perturbative contribution which is energy and process independent and\nis of order O(200 \u2212300 MeV) consistent with the uncertainty principle. Phenomenologically, these results can also be obtained by using the modified parton distribution\nR\n\n4\n\n\ffunctions as defined in (7) without the resummation of the soft gluon radiation. This\nis especially useful since this soft gluon resummation has been carried out only for\na limited number of processes. Nevertheless, this resummation is usually taken to\nbe the theoretical justification for introduction of this \"intrinsic\" momentum into\nthe standard parton distribution functions. There is also the Cronin effect in pA\ncollisions which can contribute to this intrinsic momentum. Even though Cronin\neffect is not well understood in pQCD, one can phenomenologically understand it\nin terms of multiple scattering of the proton on the nucleus which causes the pt\nbroadening of the proton [15].\nIn large nuclei and at small x, one also has to include high gluon density effects.\nIn [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] it is shown that high gluon densities lead to a potentially large\n1\nintrinsic scale Q2s (x) \u223c A1/3 x.2\u2212.4\nin large nuclei. Most gluons in the wave function\nof a nucleus in a high energy collision have momenta of the order of this scale. In\nthis paper we will investigate production of \u03b7 \u2032 in pA collisions as means of extracting\nthe gluon distribution function of nuclei at small x and study its dependence on the\nintrinsic momentum hkt2 i in protons and on saturation scale Q2s (x) in nuclei.\n\n2\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 Production Cross Section\n\nIn this section, we will calculate the \u03b7 \u2032 production in pA collisions and show how\nto extract the gluon distribution function of the nucleus A. We will consider three\ndistinct cases; first, we will calculate the \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section, with the standard gluon distribution function, and using the collinear factorization formalism.\nThen, we will consider the case when the gluons in the nucleus A are at small x\nand include saturation effects in the nuclear gluon distribution function. Finally,\nwe will allow for \"intrinsic\" momentum in a proton and consider the case when the\ngluon distribution function of the proton is also modified to take the \"intrinsic\"\nmomentum of the proton into account.\n\n2.1\n\nCollinear Factorized Cross Section\n\nUsing collinear factorization theorems in perturbative QCD, one can write the \u03b7 \u2032\nproduction cross section in pA collisions as\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X =\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2 Gp (x1 , Q2f ) GA (x2 , Q2f ) d\u03c3 gg\u2192\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n(9)\n\nwhere G(x1 , Q2f ), G(x2 , Q2f ) are the gluon distribution function of the proton and\nnucleus respectively and x1 and x2 are the momentum fraction of the incoming\n5\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\ngluons while xL = 2Pz / s and xE = 2EP / s are the momentum and energy\nfractions of the produced \u03b7 \u2032 respectively. The distribution functions, G(x1 , Q2f ) and\nG(x2 , Q2f ), depend on a factorization scale Q2f which is shown explicitly and will be\ntaken to be \u223c M\u03b72\u2032 in numerical calculations. We also note that there are no intrinsic\nmomenta included in either distribution functions since it is not, strictly speaking,\nallowed in collinear factorization formalism.\nThe partonic cross-section for gg \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 is given by\nd\u03c3 gg\u2192\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\nd3 P\n|Tgg\u2192\u03b7\u2032 |2 (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (P \u2212 p \u2212 q)\n3\n4 (p*q)2 (2\u03c0) 2EP\n1\n\nq\n\n(10)\n\nwhere p and q are the momenta of the incoming gluons while P is the momentum of\nthe produced \u03b7 \u2032 . The matrix element squared, after averaging over the initial spin\nand color degrees of freedom, becomes\n1 2 4\nH M\u2032\n64 0 \u03b7\nUsing (11), the differential cross section becomes\n|Tgg\u2192\u03b7\u2032 |2 =\n\nd\u03c3\n\ngg\u2192\u03b7\u2032\n\nH02 M\u03b72\u2032 d3 P\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (P \u2212 p \u2212 q)\n=\n3\n128 (2\u03c0) 2EP\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nThis is the elementary partonic cross section which goes into our calculation of\n\u03b7 \u2032 production in pA collisions. It should be noted that collinear factorization for\n\u03b7 \u2032 production has not been explicitly proven but is analogous to using (rigorously\nproven) collinear factorization in production of heavy quarks, high pt jets, high\nmass dileptons, etc. and that since the natural scale involved (\u03b7 \u2032 mass) is not very\nlarge, we may have large higher order corrections. This reflects itself in having cross\nsections which are quite sensitive to a change of factorization scale. Therefore, we\nfeel our results are most reliable for the ratio of cross sections (pA over pp) rather\nthan the absolute cross sections.\nUsing Eq. (12) and resolving the delta functions gives\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X\ndxL\n\n\u03c0 H02 M\u03b72\u2032 p\n=\nG (x+ , Q2f ) GA (x\u2212 , Q2f )\n64 s xE\n\u03c0 H02\nx+ Gp (x+ , Q2f ) x\u2212 GA (x\u2212 , Q2f )\n=\n64 xE\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\nx\u00b1 \u2261\n\nxE \u00b1 xL\nEP \u00b1 Pz\n\u221a\n=\n2\ns\n6\n\n(14)\n\n\fIn terms of the \u03b7 \u2032 rapidity y or the longitudinal momentum fraction xL , these are\nx\u00b1\n\nM\u03b7\u2032 e\u00b1y\n\u221a\n=\n=\ns\n\nq\n\nx2L + 4M\u03b72\u2032 /s \u00b1 xL\n2\n\n(15)\n\nHere we take the\n\u221a positive y (as well as xL ) to correspond to the proton direction.\nFor xL \u226b M\u03b7\u2032 / s, we can also write\nx+ \u2248 xL\n\nM\u03b72\u2032\nand x\u2212 \u2248\nsxL\n\n(16)\n\nEquation (13) is a very simple and useful relation which enables us to extract the\ngluon distribution function of the nucleus directly (without any de-convolution, as\nis usually the case) from the experimentally measured \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section.\nHere we are assuming that the gluon distribution function of a proton is known from\n> 0.2.\nHERA to good accuracy [21] (to better than 10%) which is the case unless x+ \u223c\nAlso, in the region x+ \u2264 10\u22124 , one also has a large uncertainty in determining the\ngluon distribution function in a proton but we avoid this region by considering small\nvalues of x\u2212 (recall x\u2212 is the momentum fraction of gluons in the nucleus) since this\nis the region where nuclear modification of the gluon distribution function is most\npronounced and least known.\nLet us make a rough estimate of the x values one can probe in a high energy pA\ncollision, such as those at RHIC or LHC. Since there are no experimental data on\nnuclear gluon distribution function at x < 10\u22122 for Q2 > 1 GeV, we would like to\nfocus on the small x (in the nucleus) kinematic region. This corresponds to the case\nwhen x\u2212 in (13) is small. This in turn corresponds to the case when the measured\n\u03b7 \u2032 has a large (much larger than its mass or Pt ) longitudinal momentum, i.e. in the\nforward region (c.f. Eq.(15)).\nAt RHIC, the largest \u03b7 \u2032 rapidity in the CM frame is about 5.36. Therefore in\nprinciple, the x\u2212 range is\n2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 < x\u2212 < 0.005\n\n(17)\n\nusing Eq.(15). Since x+ x\u2212 = M 2 /s, this range of x\u2212 corresponds to\n0.0005 < x+ < 1.0\n\n(18)\n\nFor instance, if we detect an \u03b7 \u2032 at y = 3.04, that would correspond to x+ = 0.10\nand x\u2212 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 . At LHC, the largest \u03b7 \u2032 rapidity in the CM frame is about 8.6.\nThis implies that\n3.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 < x\u2212 < 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22124\n7\n\n(19)\n\n\fSince x+ x\u2212 = M 2 /s, this range of x\u2212 corresponds to\n1.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 < x+ < 1.0\n\n(20)\n\nAgain, if we fix x+ = 0.1 or y\u03b7\u2032 = 6.35, then x\u2212 = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22127. These would be, by\norders of magnitude, the smallest values of x where gluon distribution in a nucleus\nhas ever been measured. For example, the smallest values of x measurable in fixed\ntarget DIS experiments at CERN and Fermilab is x \u223c 10\u22122 at similar Q2 [22, 23].\nTherefore, by measuring the \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section at large rapidities, one can,\nfor the first time, determine the nuclear gluon distribution function at very small\nx and moderately large Q2 . This will help one understand the nature of nuclear\nshadowing in QCD and determine the role of high parton density (higher twist)\neffects in nuclear shadowing.\n\n2.2\n\nIntrinsic Momenta\n\nIn this section, we will include the effects of intrinsic momenta in the gluon distribution of both proton and nucleus and investigate the dependence of \u03b7 \u2032 production\ncross section on the intrinsic momenta. Since introducing the intrinsic momentum\nis done in the phenomenology spirit as discussed earlier, we will take its width to\nbe the saturation scale, Qs in nucleus. This comes about because at small values of\nx in nuclei, one encounters the high gluon density region of QCD where non-linear\ngluon recombination effects become important[25, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The high\ngluon density introduces a new scale, the saturation scale Qs (x), which grows with\nenergy (Q2s (x) \u226b \u039bQCD at small x) [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Most gluons\nin the wave function of a nucleus have momenta of the order of Qs and therefore,\none may take the average (the width of the Gaussian) intrinsic momentum to be\nthis saturation scale Qs . The value of Q2s is estimated to be \u223c 1 \u2212 2 GeV2 at RHIC.\nAs a first approximation and to keep our expressions simple, we will ignore the x\ndependence of Q2s and calculate the \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section with different values\nof Qs .\nAs a first step, we will include the intrinsic momentum in a nucleus and not in\na proton since the nuclear intrinsic momentum is expected to be much larger than\nthat of a proton. Later, we will consider the most general case. The momenta of the\nincoming gluons are now, including the intrinsic momentum pt \u223c Qs in the nucleus,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nq = (x1 s/2, 0t , x1 s/2)\n(21)\nand\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\np = (x2 s/2 + p2t /2x2 s, pt , \u2212x2 s/2 + p2t /2x2 s)\n8\n\n(22)\n\n\fThe \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section then becomes\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X =\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2 d2 pt Gp (x1 , Q2f ) GA (x2 , Q2f , pt ) d\u03c3 gg\u2192\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n(23)\n\nwhere GA (x, Q2f , p2t ) = GA (x, Q2 ) f (p2t ) and f (p2t ) is a Gaussian (8) with width of\nQ2s .\nSubstituting Eq. (12) and using the \u03b4 functions gives\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X\n\u03c0 H02\n=\nx1 Gp (x1 , Q2f )x2 GA (x2 , Q2f , Pt )\nd2 Pt dxL\n64 xE\n\n(24)\n\nwhere x1 = M\u03b72\u2032 /sx\u2212 and x2 = x\u2212 and Pt is the measured transverse momentum\nof the produced \u03b7 \u2032 . Therefore, measuring the produced \u03b7 \u2032 at different rapidities\n(xL ) and transverse momentum would determine the gluon distribution of nucleus\nat various x and scale Qf \u223c M\u03b7\u2032 .\nTo get a feeling for the kinematics region where one can extract the nuclear gluon\ndistribution function, let us set Pt = 1 GeV for RHIC. The range of accessible x2\nfor the nucleus is now\n3.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 < x2 < 0.007 (RHIC)\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is still very small. For LHC, we have access to higher transverse moment. If\nwe set Pt = 5 GeV. The range of x2 in this case is\n1.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 < x2 < 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n(LHC)\n\n(26)\n\nEven for this large Pt , the accessible x2 range goes much beyond the currently\naccessible region.\nLet us now consider the most general case when both the incoming proton and\nnucleus have intrinsic momenta. It is still expected that the intrinsic momentum\nof the proton should be less than that of a nucleus. In principle, we could also\nintroduce a saturation scale for protons since at high enough energies (small x),\nthe non-linearities of the gluonic fields which lead to the saturation scale would\nbecome important even in a proton. However, in this work, we would like to restrict\nourselves to not too small values of x in a proton so that we can explore the very\nsmall x region in a nucleus. Therefore, we will ignore high gluon densities effects in\na proton and take the average intrinsic momentum in the proton as determined in\npp experiments.\n\n9\n\n\fIn the case when both proton and nucleus have transverse momenta, the momenta of the incoming gluons become\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nq = (x1 s/2 + qt2 /2x1 s, qt , x1 s/2 \u2212 qt2 /2x1 s)\n(27)\nand\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\np = (x2 s/2 + p2t /2x2 s, pt , \u2212x2 s/2 + p2t /2x2 s)\n\n(28)\n\nThe differential cross section then can be written as\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X =\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2 d2 pt d2 qt Gp (x1 , Q2f , qt ) GA (x2 , Q2f , pt ) d\u03c3 gg\u2192\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n(29)\n\nwhich, upon using Eq. (12), becomes\n\u2032\n\nd\u03c3 pA\u2192\u03b7 X\ndxL d2 Pt\n\n=\n\nM2\n\u03c0 H02 Z 2\n(30)\nd pt x1 Gp (x1 , Q2f , qt ) x2 GA (x2 , Q2f , pt )\n64 xE\nM\u0302 2 \u2212 p2t qt2 /M\u0302 2\n\nwhere qt = Pt \u2212 pt and\nM\u0302 2 (pt , qt ) =\n\nq\n1\nM 2 + 2pt *qt + (M 2 + 2pt *qt )2 \u2212 4p2t qt2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nwith\nx1 =\n\nM\u0302 2 + qt2\nsx\u2212\n\nx2 =\n\nx\u2212 M\u0302 2\n,\nM\u0302 2 + qt2\n\n(32)\n\nusing x\u00b1 = (xE \u00b1 xL )/2. The pt integration can be performed numerically which\nwould then directly relate the gluon distribution function in a nucleus GA (x, Q2f ) at\nx and Q2f \u223c M\u03b72\u2032 to the measured rapidity and Pt of the produced \u03b7 \u2032 .\nHowever, since the \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section in pA collisions is not experimentally known, we can conversely use the available parameterizations of the nuclear\ngluon distribution function to predict the \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section in pA collisions,\nfor example, in those planned at RHIC. In this work, we will take this approach and\nuse two available parameterizations of the gluon distribution function in nuclei due\nto [11] and [12].\npA\u2192\u03b7 \u2032\nIn Figure (1) we show the double differential cross section d\u03c3\nas a function\ndxL d2 Pt\n\u2032\nof \u03b7 transverse momentum at xL = 0.1 for two different values of the intrinsic\nmomentum (saturation scale) in the nucleus.

Again a decrease in the cross section is seen as we go to higher\nintrinsic momenta. In both Figures (1) and (2) BQV shadowing [12] is used.\nIn Figure (3) we show the ratio of \u03b7 \u2032 production cross sections in pp and pA\ncollisions for two representative values of the nuclear intrinsic momenta. As shown,\nthis ratio is quite sensitive to the value of the intrinsic momenta. We have checked\nthat the choice of parameterization of nuclear shadowing ([11] or [12]) makes very\nlittle difference.\nFollowing the thermal model estimate, we expect that the total cross-section for\n\u2032\n\u03b7 production should be about 3\u20135% of \u03c0 0 cross-section. Among the decay mode of\n\u03b7 \u2032 , the experimentally cleanest one is the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel. This process has the\nbranching ratio of about 2 %. Therefore, the branching ratio times the cross-section\nshould be on the order of A\u03c3\u03c00 /1000 \u223c 1 mb.

We have shown that experimental\nmeasurement of this cross section at RHIC would lead to determination of the\ngluon distribution function in nuclei in a much wider kinematic region accessible\nby any other process in the current experiments. Conversely, we have used the\navailable parameterizations of the gluon distribution function in nuclei to predict\nthe \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section in pA collisions at RHIC.\nThere are several points which need to be better understood in order to make\nour calculation more accurate. First of all, we have included only the gluon fusion\nand ignored all other possible mechanisms of \u03b7 \u2032 production. For example, it may be\npossible to produce \u03b7 \u2032 through production of quarks and anti-quarks which would\nhadronize into a \u03b7 \u2032 through a completely non-perturbative fragmentation function.\nThe effect of this mechanism is hard to estimate since quark (or anti-quark) fragmentation into \u03b7 \u2032 has not been measured.\nWe have also taken the \u03b7 \u2032 mass to be a constant (958 MeV) since we don't expect\nto have a Quark Gluon Plasma produced in a pp or pA collision. One then would\nhave had to investigate the temperature dependence of the anomaly and include\nthe poorly understood temperature dependence of the \u03b7 \u2032 mass. However, there\nis a recent study of high gluon density effects on instantons [40] which indicates\nthe average instanton size shrinks as the saturation scale Qs grows analogous to\nthe finite temperature case. This would imply that \u03b7 \u2032 would become lighter and\nits production cross section would increase at higher energies due to the rise of Qs .\nDecreasing \u03b7 \u2032 mass would reduce our gg\u03b7 \u2032 matrix element (11) and our \u03b7 \u2032 production\ncross section. Therefore measuring \u03b7 \u2032 production cross section at different energies,\nfor example at RHIC would help clarify this point.\nAlso, we are using the collinear factorization for a process for which there is no\nproof even though one may naively expect it to hold in analogy to heavy quark production. Our factorization scale, M\u03b72\u2032 is not very high and our results are somewhat\nsensitive to the change in this scale. Therefore, we feel that our results are most\nreliable for ratio of pA to pp cross sections for \u03b7 \u2032 production.\n\n13\n\n\fAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank C. Gale, D. Kharzeev, L.
