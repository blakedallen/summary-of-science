C., Canada V6T1Z1\n(Dated: October 25, 2018)\nWe have studied spin structures of fluctuation-driven fractionalized vortices and topological spin\norder in 2D nematic superfluids of cold sodium atoms. Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest a\nsoftened \u03c0-spin disclination structure in a half-quantum vortex when spin correlations are short\nranged; in addition, calculations indicate that a unique non-local topological spin order emerges\nsimultaneously as cold atoms become a superfluid below a critical temperature. We have also\nestimated fluctuation-dependent critical frequencies for half-quantum vortex nucleation in rotating\noptical traps and discussed probing these excitations in experiments.\n\nQuantum number fractionalization has been one of the\nmost fundamental and exciting concepts studied in modern many-body physics and topological field theories[1,\n2, 3, 4]. During the past few years, low dimensional fractionalized quantum states have further been proposed\nto be promising candidates for carrying out fault tolerant quantum computation[5] and their realizations in\noptical lattices were explored[6, 7, 8]. A closely related\ntopic in which there has also been a growing interest is\nvortex fractionalization in cold gases (see for instance\nRef.[9, 10, 11, 12]). Especially, motivated by experiments\non low dimensional cold gases[13], Mukerjee et al studied 2D superfluids of cold atoms and analyzed the role\nplayed by fractionalized vortices in phase transitions[10].\nHowever, spin structures of those half-quantum vortices\ninduced by thermal fluctuations and potential topological order[14] haven't been thoroughly explored and remain to be understood. In this Letter we illustrate spin\nstructures of fractionalized vortices; in addition, we also\nshow that 2D quantum gases with short ranged spin correlations can have a topological spin order. We further\nestimate critical nucleation frequencies of fractionalized\nvortices in optical traps which can potentially be studied\nin experiments[15].\nOur simulations illustrate that in a fundamental vortex\ncarrying one-half of circulation quantum h/m (h is the\nPlanck constant and m is the mass of atoms), there exists\na softened spin disclination (i.e. a disclination in the absence of spin stiffness) even when local spin moments are\nstrongly fluctuating at finite temperatures. The topological winding number associated with softened spin disclinations is conserved as far as the phase rigidity remains finite. This effectively leads to a non-local topological spin\norder. Such a nonlocal order is absent in a conventional\ncondensate of atoms or pairs of atoms. We have further\nstudied creation of these excitations in rotating superfluids and obtained fluctuation-dependent critical frequencies for half-quantum vortex(HQV) nucleation. HQVs in\ntraps can be probed by measuring a precession of eigenaxes of surface quadrupole modes.\nWe employ the Hamiltonian introduced previously for\n\nF=1 sodium atoms in optical lattices[9, 16],\nH =\n\nX bL\nk\n\n\u2212 tL\n\n2\nX\n\n\u03c1\u03022k +\n\n<kl>\n\ncL 2\n\u015c\n2 k\n\n\u2020\n(\u03c8k,\u03b1\n\u03c8l,\u03b1 + h.c.) \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\u0302k .\n\n(1)\n\nk\n\nHere k is the lattice site index and < kl > are the nearest\nneighbor sites. \u03bc is the chemical potential and tL is the\none-particle hopping amplitude. Two coupling constants\n2 R\ndr(\u03c6\u2217w (r)\u03c6w (r))2 ; b, c are effecare bL (cL ) = b(c) 4\u03c0h\u0304\nm\ntive s-wave scattering lengths, \u03c6w is the localized Wannier function for atoms in a periodical potential. Operators \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 , \u03b1 = x, y, z create hyperfine spin-one atoms in\n\u221a1 (|1 > \u2212| \u2212 1 >), \u2212i \u221a1 (|1 > +| \u2212 1 >) and |0 > states\n2\n2\nrespectively. The spin and number operators are defined\nas \u015c\u03b1 = \u2212i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03c8\u03b2\u2020 \u03c8\u03b3 , and \u03c1\u0302 = \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 \u03c8\u03b1 . Spin correlations\nare mainly induced by interaction cL \u015c 2 . Here we consider\nantiferromagnetic spin-dependent interactions such as in\nsodium atoms where cL > 0. Minimization of this antiferromagnetic spin-dependent interaction requires that the\n\u2020\norder parameter \u03a8\u03b1 (=< \u03c8k,\u03b1\n>) be a real vector up to a\n\u221a\nglobal phase, i.e. \u03a8 = N n exp(i\u03c7) where n is a unit director on a two-sphere, exp(i\u03c7) represents a phase director and N is the number of atoms per site. All low energy\ndegrees of freedom are characterized by configurations\nwhere n and \u03c7 vary slowly in space and time[9]. Low\nlying collective modes include spin-wave\n\u221a excitations with\nenergy dispersion \u03c9(q) = vs q, vs = cL\u221a\ntL a and phasewave excitations with \u03c9(q) = vp q, vp = bL tL a (here a\nis the lattice constant). In one-dimensions, low energy\nquantum fluctuations destroy spin order leading to quantum spin disordered superfluids[17]. In two-dimensions,\nthe amplitude of quantum spin fluctuations is of order of\ncL /tL and is negligible in shallow lattices as tL is order-ofmagnitude bigger than cL . At finite temperatures, spin\ncorrelations are mainly driven by long wave length thermal fluctuations, analogous to quantum 1D cases. This\naspect was also paid attention to previously and normalsuperfluid transitions were investigated[10].\nWe therefore study the following Hamiltonian which\neffectively captures long wave length thermal fluctuations\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1\n10\n\n1\n\n3\n\n0.5\n10\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n0.2 0.4\nT/J\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\nT/J\n(c)\n\n0.45\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n64\n\n128\nloop size\n(d)\n\n192\n\n256\n\n0\n\n64\n\n128\nloop size\n(f)\n\n192\n\n256\n\nHQV and underlying topological spin order Around a\nHQV, both phase and nematic directors rotate slowly by\n1800 ; in polar coordinates (\u03b8,p\u03c1), a HQV in condensates\nis represented by \u03a8(\u03b8, \u03c1) = N (\u03c1) exp(i\u03b8/2)n(\u03b8), with\nn = (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2), 0)[12, 17]. The question here is\nwhether, when nematic directors are not ordered, a spin\ndisclination is still present in a HQV. To fully take into\naccount 2D thermal fluctuations, we carry out Monte\nCarlo simulations on a square lattice of 128 \u00d7 128 sites\nand study spatial correlations between a HQV and a \u03c0spin disclination, and topological order.\nWe first identify critical temperatures of the normalsuperfluid phase transition by calculating correlations\nand the phase rigidity.

In simulations, we have studied these correlation functions and\nfound that the phase correlation length for f p (r1 , r2 ) becomes divergent at a temperature 0.35J which is identified as a critical temperature Tc . We also calculate the\nphase rigidity or the renormalized phase coupling Jp\n\n1\n\n0\n\ns,p\nf s,p (r1 , r2 ) =< Qs,p\n\u03b1\u03b2 (r1 )Q\u03b1\u03b2 (r2 ) > .\n\nJkl nk * nl \u03a6k * \u03a6l ;\n\n(2)\n\nhere states at each site are specified by two unit directors:\na nematic director, n = (cos \u03c60 sin \u03b80 , sin \u03c60 sin \u03b80 , cos \u03b80 )\nand a phase director, \u03a6 = (cos \u03c7, sin \u03c7). Jkl = 2N tL\nis the effective coupling between two neighboring sites\nand depends on N , the number of atoms per site. The\nmodel is invariant under the following local Ising gauge\ntransformation: ni \u2192 si ni , \u03a6 \u2192 si \u03a6i , and si = \u00b11.\nIn the following, we present results of our simulations on\n2D superfluids, especially spin structures, energetics of\nHQVs and nucleation of HQVs in rotating optical traps\nusing the effective Hamiltonian in Eq.2.\n\nJp =\n\n\u22022F\n;\n\u2202\u03b4\u03c72\n\n(4)\n\nhere \u03b4\u03c7 is a small phase difference applied across the opposite boundaries of the lattice and F is the corresponding free energy. We indeed find that it approaches zero\nat Tc while at T = 0 Jp takes a bare value J. Meanwhile, the spin correlation function f s (r1 , r2 ) remains to\nbe short ranged across Tc . By extrapolating our data\nto lower temperatures, we find that the spin correlation\nlength diverges only at T = 0 (see Fig.1a). Our simulations for correlation lengths are in agreement with previous results in Ref.[10]; they are also consistent with the\ncontinuum limit of the model in Eq.2 which is equivalent\nto an XY model and an O(3) nonlinear-sigma model.\nIn order to keep track of the winding of nematic directors in a wildly fluctuating back ground, we introduce the\nfollowing gauge invariant \u03c0-rotation checking operator,\nwhich is essentially a product of sign-checking operators\nWs =\n\nY\n<kl>\u2208C\n\nsign(nk * nl ), Wp =\n\nY\n<kl>\u2208C\n\nsign(\u03a6k * \u03a6l ).(5)\n\nHere the product is carried out along a closed squareshape path C centered at the origin of a 2D lattice. Ws,p\ncan be either +1 or \u22121; and Ws (Wp ) is \u22121 when C encloses a \u03c0-spin disclination (HQV). The gauge invariant\ncirculation of supercurrent\nvelocity (in units of \u03c0h\u0304/m)\nP\nis defined as C = \u03c01 \u2208C sign(nk * nl ) sin(\u03c7k \u2212 \u03c7l ); this\nquantity is equal to one in a HQV.\n\n\f3\nIn our simulations, we investigate the winding number\n< Ws,p >hv averaged over configurations where phase\ndirectors rotate by 1800 around the boundary of the lattice and the center plaquette. At temperatures above\nthe normal-superfluid transition temperature Tc , both\nwinding numbers Ws,p and circulation C are averaged\nto zero within our numerical accuracy(see Fig.1). And\nour choice of boundary conditions does not lead to a vortex or disclination configuration in the absence of phase\nrigidity. Below Tc , the circulation C is averaged to one indicating that the boundary conditions effectively project\nout HQV configurations. Meanwhile, we observe loopperimeter dependent hWs,p ihv which can be attributed\nto the background fluctuations of HQV or disclination\npairs. The loop-perimeter dependence of hWs,p ihv here is\nalmost identical to that for uniform boundary conditions,\ni.e. the back ground value. After normalizing hWs,p ihv\nin terms of background winding numbers hWs,p ibg , we\nhWp ihv\ns ihv\nfind both hW\nhWs ibg and hWp ibg approach \u22121 (see Fig.1).\nWe thus demonstrate that a softened disclination is spatially correlated with a HQV. At the temperatures we\ncarry out these simulations the spin correlation length is\nsufficiently short compared to the size of the lattice. At\nfurther lower temperatures, the spin correlation length\nbecomes longer than the lattice size and fluctuations of\npairs of disclination-anti-disclination are strongly suppressed; < Ws,p >hv are equal to \u22121 for almost all loops,\nwhich corresponds to a mean field result.\nResults in Fig.1 indicate that there exists a softened\nspin disclination in a HQV. This is a distinct feature\nin our systems and there exist no such additional magnetic structures in HQVs in conventional molecular condensates of atom pairs discussed perviously[18]. Thus,\n\u03c0-disclinations like HQVs have logarithmically divergent\nenergies and are fully suppressed in ground states. Our\nresults also illustrate that although the average local\nspin quadrupole moments Qs\u03b1\u03b2 vanish because of strong\nfluctuations, an overall \u03c0-rotation of nematic directors\nin disclinations is still conserved because of a coupling\nto the superfluid component. This coupling between a\nHQV and disclination can also be attributed[19] to a coupling between Higgs matter and discrete gauge fields[20].\nFurthermore, the absence of unbound \u03c0-disclinations in\nsuperfluids indicates a topological order, similar to the\none introduced previously for an isotropic phase of liquid crystal[21]. Consequently, once a conventional phase\norder appears below a critical temperature, a topological\nspin order simultaneously emerges while spin correlations\nremain short ranged.\nThe emergent topological order can be further verified\nby examining the average of product-operator Ws,p over\nall configurations (with open boundaries). Above the\nnormal-superfluid transition temperature Tc , we again\nfind that Ws,p both are averaged to zero within our\nnumerical accuracy implying proliferation of unbound\nHQVs or disclinations. Below Tc , we study the loopperimeter dependence of average winding numbers hWs,p i\nand find that both lnhWp i and lnhWs i are linear functions\n\nof loop-perimeter analogous to the Wilson-loop-product\nof deconfining gauge fields[22]; if there were unbound\ndisclinations, one should expect that lnhWp i is proportional to, instead of the loop-perimeter, the loop-area\nwhich represents the number of unbound disclinations\nenclosed by the loop.\nCritical frequency for HQV nucleation Let us now\nturn to the nucleation of those excitations in rotating\ntraps[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. To understand the critical frequency for nucleation, we study the free energy of a\nvortex, in a rotating frame, as a function of the distance\nr from the axis of a cylindrical optical trap (the axis is\nalong the z-direction),\n0\nFh.v. (r) = Fh.v.\n(r) \u2212 \u03a9Lz (r).\n\n(6)\n\n0\nHere Fh.v.\n(r) is the free energy of a HQV located at distance r from the trap axis in the absence of rotation,\nLz (r) is the angular momentum of the vortex state and\n\u03a9 is the rotating frequency.\n0\nIn a 2D lattice without a trapping potential, Fh.v.\nis\napproximately equal to \u03c04 (Jp + Js ) ln(L/a), with leading contributions from phase winding and spin twisting;\nhere Jp,s are renormalized phase and spin coupling respectively and L is the size of system. For an integerquantum vortex (IQV), Fv0 is equal to \u03c0Jp ln(L/a). The\n0\nratio between Fh.v.\nand Fv0 depends on the ratio Js /Jp or\nspin fluctuations; in the limit L approaches infinity, the\n0\nratio Fh.v.\n/Fv0 changes discontinuously from 21 at T = 0\nwhere Jp \u2248 Js = J to 41 at finite low temperatures in 2D\nwhere Js vanishes. In simulations of a finite trap (see below), because of a finite size effect we find that this ratio\nvaries from 0.5 to 0.2 smoothly as temperatures increase\nfrom 0 to Tc .\nTo study nucleation of half-quantum vortices in an optical trap, we assume a nearly harmonic trapping po2 2\ntential V (r) = 1/2m\u03c9tr\nr , with \u03c9tr being the trap frequency. The average number of particles per site N (r)\nhas a Thomas-Fermi profile; N (r) = N0 (1 \u2212 r2 /RT2 F ),\nhere N0 is the number density at the center and RT F is\nthe Thomas-Fermi radius. Furthermore, the optical lattice potential along the axial direction is sufficiently deep\nso that atoms are confined in a two-dimensional xy plane;\nthe in-plane lattice potential depth is set to be 5ER (ER\nis the photon recoil energy).\nFor the trap and lattice geometry described above, we\ncalculate parameters in Eq.1 and obtain tL = 77nK, bL =\n187nK and cL = 10nK. For N0 = 1.2 and trap frequency\n\u03c9tr = 120Hz, we also\n\u221a find that RT F = 43a and Lh.o. =\n4a where Lh.o. (= 1/ 2m\u03c9tr ) is the harmonic oscillator\nlength. The coupling Jkl in Eq.2 depends on the distance\nfrom the center of trap and at the center, the coupling\nis about 154nK. In non-rotating or slowly rotating traps,\nthe free energy maximum is located at the center and\nthere should be no vortices in the trap. As frequencies\nare increased, a local energy minimum appears at the\ncenter and becomes degenerate with the no-vortex state\nat a thermodynamic critical frequency (which is about\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n2000\n\n80\n0\n-100\n35\n\n40\n\n60\n\n45\n\u03a9c [Hz]\n\n0\n\n-1000\n\n-2000\n-64\n\nD\n\nFh.v.[nK]\n\n1000\n\n0\n0.08\u03c9tr\n0.23\u03c9tr\n0.32\u03c9tr\n-32\n\n32\n\n64\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.3\nT[J]\n\n0.4\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nr\n\nRatio\n\n100\n\n0\n0.1\n\nHQV\nIQV\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nT[J]\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) a) The free energy of a HQV at a\ndistance r from the trap center at rotation frequencies 0, 0.08,\n0.23 and 0.32 (in units of trap frequency \u03c9tr = 120Hz) at T =\n0.33J. Details near the edge are shown in the inset. At the\ncenter, the exchange coupling is J = 154 nK. b) The critical\nfrequencies \u03a9D\nc for HQVs (solid line) and IQVs (dashed line).\nInset is the temperature-dependence of the ratio between the\n0\nHQV energy Fh.v.\nand the IQV energy Fv0 .\n\n0.08\u03c9tr at T = 0.33J); however because of a large energy\nbarrier separating the two degenerate states as shown in\nFig.2, vortices are still prohibited from entering the trap.\nFurther speeding up rotations results in an energetically lower and spatially narrower barrier. Within the\nrange of temperatures studied, thermal activation turns\nout to be insignificant within an experimental time scale\n(\u223c 100ms) because of low attempt frequencies. So only\nwhen the spatial width of barrier becomes comparable to\na hydrodynamic breakdown length[30], the barrier can\nno longer be felted and vortices start to penetrate into\nthe trap. We use this criterion to numerically determine\nthe dynamical critical frequency for vortex nucleation\nD\n\u03a9D\nc ; for IQVs, the calculated \u03a9c is a flat function of T\n(see Fig.2b) which is qualitatively consistent with earlier\nestimates[31].\n0\nFor HQVs, Fh.v.\ndepends on the renormalized spin coupling Js and therefore the amplitude of spin fluctuations.\nBecause of this, \u03a9D\nc varies from about 0.32\u03c9tr at T = 0\nwhere Js \u2248 Jp and Fh.v. \u2248 0.5Fv due to a finite size\neffect (see the inset of Fig.2), to about 0.17\u03c9tr at temperatures close to Tc where Js = 0 and Fh.v. \u2248 0.2Fv . In\nother words, this unique temperature dependence can be\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nW. P. Su et al., Phys. Rev. B22, 2099 (1980).\nD. C. Tsui et al., Phys. Rev.

It is worth remarking that in the\nthermodynamic limit where Js approaches zero at any\nfinite temperatures, Fh.v. approaches 41 Fv as mentioned\nbefore. Consequently, \u03a9D\nc (about 0.17\u03c9tr ) for HQVs is\nabout one-half of the critical frequency for IQVs (about\n0.36\u03c9tr for the finite trap studied here). Also note that\nthe zero temperature estimate of \u03a9D\nc is close to the previously obtained value of critical frequencies of HQVs in\nBose-Einstein condensates[29].\nThe interaction between two HQVs with the same vorticity at a separation distance d contains two parts. One,\nVcc (> 0) is from interactions between two supercurrent\nvelocity fields which is logarithmic as a function of d;\nand the other, Vss is from interaction between two spin\ntwisting fields accompanying HQVs. For a disclinationanti disclination pair, in the dilute limit one finds that\nVcc \u223c \u2212Vss resulting in a cancellation of long range interactions. The resultant short-range repulsions lead to\nsquare vortex lattices found in numerical simulations[32].\nFor fluctuation-driven fractionalized vortices, Vss is almost zero and the overall interactions are always logarithmically repulsive. HQVs nucleated in a rotating trap\nshould therefore form a usual triangular vortex lattice.\nIndividual vortex lines can be probed either by studying a precession of eigenaxes of surface quadrupole mode\nin rotating superfluids[33]. In the later approach, one\nstudies the angular momentum carried per particle in a\nHQV state. When a HQV is nucleated in the trap, superfluids are no longer irrotational and the angular momentum per particle is h/2 rather than h per particle\nfor an integer vortex state. When a surface quadrupole\noscillation across a rotating superfluid is excited, larger\naxes of quadrupole oscillation start to precess just as in\nthe case of integer vortices. However, the precession rate\nis only one half of the value for an integer vortex state\nwhich can be studied in experiments.\nIn conclusion, 2D superfluids of sodium atoms have\na non-local topological spin order. In rotating traps,\nfluctuation-driven fractionalized vortices can nucleate at\na critical frequency which is about half of that for integer\nvortices. Observation of these exotic excitations could\nsubstantially improve our understanding of topological\norder and fractionalization. We thank J. Zhang and Z.\nC.
