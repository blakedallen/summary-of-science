One of the simplest models for anisotropic antiferromagnets in an external magnetic field is described by the following spin-1/2\nXXZ model Hamiltonian:\n\u0011\nX\nX\u0010\nSix Sjx + Siy Sjy + \u2206Siz Sjz \u2212 h\nSiz , (1)\nH=J\nhi,ji\n\ni\n\nwhere Si\u03b1 is the \u03b1(= x, y, z) component of the spin1/2 operator at site i, h is an external magnetic field\napplied in the z-direction, and hi, ji runs over all the\nnearest-neighbor pairs of spins at sites i and j. J(> 0)\nis antiferromagnetic coupling and \u2206(\u2265 0) is anisotropic\nconstant. Mean-field calculations of the spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel [2], supporting N\u00e9el's prediction, found the firstorder phase transition from the N\u00e9el ordered state to the\nspin-flopping state with increasing the magnetic field h.\nOn the contrary to these studies, it is known from Bethe\nansatz solution that the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2\nXXZ model shows a second-order transition in the presence of the external magnetic field [3]. The discrepancy\nis assigned to the inadequacy of treating quantum fluctuations by the mean-field theories. It is thus important to\nuse an unbiased numerical method for understanding the\ncorrect nature of the magnetization process even for the\nsimplest systems such as one given by Eq. (1) in higher\nspatial dimensions since there exist no analitically exact\nsolutions. This is preciely one of our purposes for this\npaper [4].\nAnother importance of studing the spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel defined by Eq. (1) comes from the fact that the\nmodel is mapped onto a system of hard core bosons with\nnearest-neighbor repulsions described by the Hamiltonian\n\u0011\nX\nX\nX\u0010 \u2020\nni nj \u2212 \u03bc\nni , (2)\nci cj + c\u2020j ci + V\nHB = \u2212t\nhi,ji\n\nhi,ji\n\ni\n\nwith t = J/2, V = J\u2206, and \u03bc = h + zJ\u2206/2 (z: coordination number)[5]. Here c\u2020i is a creation operator of\n\n\u2020\nhard core boson at\nThe total magPsitez i and ni = ci ci . P\nnetization Mz = i Si thus relates to i (ni \u2212 1/2) in\nthe boson model. The boson Hamiltonian HB is proposed as a model Hamiltonian to study properties of liquid 4 He [6], granular superconducting arrays [7], and flux\nlines in superconductors [8]. The ground state phase diagram has been studied using mean-field theories [2, 9]\nand numerical methods [10], and shows a Mott insulating\nphase, a superfluid phase, and a phase with having both\nthe orders simultaneously (supersolid phase). The correspondence of these states to those in the spin model is as\nfollows: Mott insulating and N\u00e9el states, superfluid and\nspin-flopping states, and supersolid and \"intermediate\"\nspin states [2], respectively.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to show a clear evidence for the first-order phase transition of the 2D and\n3D spin-1/2 XXZ models in the presence of a magnetic\nfield by using recently developed numerical method and\npresent the ground state phase diagrams. The presence of\na phase-separated phase and the absence of the supersolid\nphase in the closely related system of hard core bosons\nwith nearest-neighbor repulsions are also discussed.\nThe magnetization process of the 2D and 3D spin-1/2\nXXZ models defined by Eq. (1) is studied numerically\non square (number of spins Ns = L \u00d7 L) and cubic\n(Ns = L \u00d7 L \u00d7 L) lattices using quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) technique based on stochastic series expansions\n(SSE) [11]. Very recently an important technical improvement have been achieved by Sandvik [12]. He found\na new algorithm of cluster-type updates (operator-loop\nupdates) within the SSE QMC scheme which reduces autocorrelation time drastically compared to simulations\nusing only local updates. While this method is very similar to the loop algorithm in the world-line QMC method\nproposed by Evertz et al. [13], one major advantage of the\nSSE method with operator-loop updates is that there is\nno difficulty in simulating systems with anisotropic couplings in external magnetic fields owing to not having\nto have \"freezing\" configurations and \"global\" weights\nwhich make the loop algorithm in the world-line QMC\nmethod highly inefficient [12]. This reduced autocorrelation time enables us to go down to very low temperatures\n\n\f2\nin very high magnetic fields and therefore the method\nis suitable for our purpose. Another advantage of this\nstudy using the SSE scheme over other earlier numerical\nstudies [4, 10, 14] is that the simulations are performed\ndirectly in the ground canonical ensemble, i.e., magnetization per site mz = Mz /Ns is calculated for a given\nmagnetic field h. In this paper temperatures T are set\nto be J/kB T = 2L which is low enough to study the\nground state properties on finite lattices [15], and periodic boundary condition is used. The exchange coupling\nJ will be taken as the energy unit. Since there exists\nlong-range N\u00e9el-ordered state only for \u2206 \u2265 1.0, from\nwhich the first-order spin-flop transition can take place\nby applying a finite external field, our main focus in this\npaper will be put on this anisotropic regime.\n0.4\n\nmZ\n\n2D\n\n0.3\n\n\u2206=1.5\n\n\u03c4(l) (b)\n\n(a)\n\n4.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.0 0\n10\n10.0\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n1.82\n\nh\n\n1.84\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\nmZ=0.5\n\u03c1s=0\n\n5.0\n\n0.1\n\n(ii)\n\n: L=12\n: L=16\n: L=20\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n10\n\nmZ\u22600\n\u03c1s\u22600\n\nm =0\n(i) \u03c1 Z=0\n3.0\n\nh\n\nl\n\n(c)\n(iii)\n\n0.0\n1.0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\ns\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n\u2206\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Magnetization curve of the 2D spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel with \u2206 = 1.5.

(c) The ground\nstate phase diagram of the 2D spin-1/2 XXZ model with\nanisotropic constant \u2206 in the presence of the magnetic field\nh. There exist three phases: (i) N\u00e9el ordered phase, (ii) spinflopping phase, and (iii) fully saturated ferromagnetic phase.\nSolid line is 2(1 + \u2206) (see in the text). Dashed line is a guide\nto the eye.\n\nLet us first study the magnetization process in 2D. A\ntypical example of the magnetization curves is shown in\nFig. 1 (a). One can see that at certain critical magnetic\nfield hc the magnetization mz changes discontinuously\nfrom 0 to a finite value mcz . For this example in the figure\nwith \u2206 = 1.5 the magnetization jumps at hc \u223c 1.83 to\nmcz \u223c 0.11 [16]. Working on various system sizes (see in\nthe inset of Fig. 1(a)), we confirm that finite size effects\nare small and conclude that the jump in magnetization\nis not due to extrinsic factors of working on finite-size\nlattices. The result already gives a clear evidence for the\nfirst-order phase transition.\nIn order to illustrate that autocorrelation times of our\n\n5.0\n\nQMC measurements are short enough, the integrated autocorrelation time \u03c4int is estimated as follows: we first\ndivide a sequence of Monte Carlo data points into bins\nof length l, and for each bin length l, the average of the\ndata in the bth bin and the variance \u03c3 2 (l) of the bin\naverages are calculated. The integrated autocorrelation\ntime \u03c4int is then estimated by the asymptotic value of\n\u03c4 (l) = l\u03c3 2 (l)/2\u03c3 2 (l = 1) at large l above which \u03c4 (l) does\nnot depend on l [17]. The results of \u03c4int for mz and spin\nstructure factor S(q) at q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) are shown in Fig. 1\n(b) for \u2206 = 1.5 and h = 2.0. From this figure \u03c4int 's are\nestimated to be no longer than 4\u20135 MC steps. Since we\nuse bin length l = 1000 or more to estimate the statistical errors, we can be sure that our error bar is accurate.\nIt should be noted here that \u03c4int can be controlled by\nchanging how many times closed loops are constructed\nin the operator-loop updates. In this paper we have to\nconstruct closed loops as many as about 1000 times per\nMC step for larger values of \u2206.\nRepeating the same procedure for different values of \u2206,\nthe ground state phase diagram of the 2D spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel is completed. The result is given in Fig. 1 (c).\nThere exist three different phases denoted by (i) mz = 0,\n(ii) mz 6= 0, and (iii) mz = 0.5 in the Figure. The third\nphase (iii) corresponds to a fully saturated ferromagnetic\nphase and is separated from the second phase (ii) by the\n. This transition is trivial and\ncritical magnetic field hmax\nc\nis not our interest here. The critical magnetic field hmax\nc\nis indeed easily calculated by going to the boson model\ndescribed by Eq. (2): the critical chemical potential to\nhave just one particle in the d-dimensional boson system\nis \u22122dt and therefore hmax\n/J is found to be d(1 + \u2206).\nc\nTo show further evidence for the first-order transition between phase (i) and phase P\n(ii) we calculate the\nspin structure factor S(q) = 1/Ns i,j eiq*(i\u2212j) Si * Sj at\nq = (\u03c0, \u03c0) and the spin stiffness (helicity modulus) \u03c1s as\na function of h for a fixed \u2206. The spin stiffness \u03c1s is calculated by, for example, \u03c1s = T hwx2 +wy2 (+wz2 )i/dLd\u22122 in\n2D (3D) where w\u03b1 is the winding number per linear spatial lattice size L in the \u03b1-direction [18]. \u03c1s corresponds\nto the superfluid density in the boson model and is used\nto detect the superfluid phase in the system [9, 10, 18].\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2(a) for \u2206 = 1.5 as a function of h. When h is small S(q) has a peak at q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)\n(q dependence is not shown) and \u03c1s = 0. With increasing\nh these quantities change discontinuously at hc where the\nmagnetization mz jumps, and S(\u03c0, \u03c0) becomes zero while\n\u03c1s has a finite value [19]. Apparently these two phases\nare (i) N\u00e9el ordered phase (for h < hc ) and (ii) spinflopping phase (for h > hc ), and are separated through\nthe first-order transition [20].\nEarlier studies found the supersolid phase in the boson\nmodel characterized by having finite values of S(\u03c0, \u03c0) and\n\u03c1s simultaneously in a region between phase (i) and phase\n(ii) of the phase diagram [9, 10]. One can indeed barely\nsee small but finite values of S(\u03c0, \u03c0) for h > hc where \u03c1s is\nfinite (see Fig.2 (a)). In order to elucidate systematically\nthe possibility of the existence of the supersolid phase\n\n\f3\nin 2D, we carry out the finite size scaling analyses of\nS(\u03c0, \u03c0) and \u03c1s for fixed magnetizations. The results are\npresented in Fig. 2(b). One can see that S(\u03c0, \u03c0)/Ns (\u03c1s )\nstays finite in the limit of Ns \u2192 \u221e for h < hc (h >\nhc ) while S(\u03c0, \u03c0)/Ns approaches to zero at Ns \u2192 \u221e for\nh > hc . Doing the similar analyses for different values of\n\u2206 and mz it is found that whenever h > hc S(\u03c0, \u03c0)/Ns\ngoes to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We therefore\nconclude that the supersolid phase does not exist in the\n2D spin-1/2 XXZ model. The results are consistent with\nvery recent studies by Batrouni and Scalettar [14].\n\ndination number in 3D makes the needed magnetic field\nlarger to destroy the N\u00e9el state. The similar finite size\nscaling analyses which was done for the 2D model do not\nfind the supersolid phase in the 3D model.\n0.4\n\n(a)\n\n3D \u2206=1.5\n: mZ\n: \u03c1S\n: S(\u03c0,\u03c0,\u03c0)/NS\n\n0.3\n\nh\n\n(b)\n\n10.0\n\n(iii) mZ=0.5\n\u03c1s =0\n\n0.2\n\n(ii) mZ\u22600\n\u03c1s \u22600\n\n(a)\n0.2\n\n5.0\n: \u03c1S\n: S(\u03c0,\u03c0)/NS\n\n0.1\n\nm =0\n(i) \u03c1 Z=0\n\n0.1\n\ns\n\n2.8\n\nS(\u03c0,\u03c0)/NS\n\n1.81\n\n1.83\n\n0.0\n1.0\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n\nmz=0.0\n\n0.3\n\nh\n\n2.5\n\n(b)\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n\u03c1S\n\nmz=0.113\n\n0.2\n\nS(\u03c0,\u03c0)/NS\n\n0.19\n0.18\n\nmz=0.113\n\n0.008\n\n1.0\n\n3.0\n2.0\n\n3.2\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nh\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n\u2206\n\n5.0\n\nFIG. 3: (a) mz , S(\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0), and \u03c1s for the 3D spin-1/2 XXZ\nmodel with \u2206 = 1.5 and Ns = 83 as a function of the magnetic field h.

Our\nstrong evidence for the first-order transition is provided\nin Fig. 3(a). In the Figure magnetization mz , spin structure factor S(\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0), and spin stiffness \u03c1s for \u2206 = 1.5\nare plotted as a function of the external magnetic field h.\nIt is clearly seen that as in the case of the 2D model\nthose quantities change discontinuously at the critical\nmagnetic field hc . Working with different values of \u2206,\nthe ground state phase diagram is constructed and the\nresult is shown in Fig. 3(b). As in 2D the phase diagram consists of three different phases: (i) N\u00e9el ordered\nphase, (ii) spin-flopping phase, and (iii) fully saturated\nferromagnetic phase [21]. The critical magnetic field hc\nin 3D is observed to be larger compared to that in 2D\nfor a given \u2206. This is simply because the increased coor-\n\nFinally we summarize our results in Fig. 4 by showing\nthe ground state phase diagrams of the 2D and 3D spin1/2 XXZ models on the parameter space of anisotropic\nconstant \u2206 and magnetization mz . The phase diagrams\nshow (i) the N\u00e9el ordered state at \u2206 \u2265 1.0 and mz = 0.0,\n(ii) the spin-flopping state with \u03c1s 6= 0, (iii) the fully\nsaturated ferromagnetic state at mz = 0.5, and (iv) a\nphase-separated state (denoted by PS in the Figures).\nThe phase-separated region exists because as was seen in\nFigs. 1(a) and 3(a) there is a region in magnetization mz\nto which we can not reach in a thermodynamically stable\nway no matter how fine the magnetic field h is tuned. In\nother words, if one could have a states with mz which is\nin this magnetization region, the state would be phaseseparated between the N\u00e9el state with mz = 0 and the\nspin-flopping state with mz = mcz . Some earlier studies predicted two phase coexisting regions working with\nthe canonical ensemble (i.e., fixed mz ) and their results\nwere interpreted as the supersolid phase [9, 10]. However\nour calculations conclude that these phases are thermodynamically unstable and are phase-separated. Our conclusions are consistent with recent studies by Batrouni\nand Scalettar for the 2D boson model [14].\nIn conclusion, we have studied numerically the magnetization process of the spin-1/2 anisotropic XXZ model\nin two and three spatial dimensions using QMC method\nbased on SSE and shown clear evidences of the first-order\nphase transition in the presence of an external magnetic\n\n\f4\n5.0\n\n\u2206\n\n5.0\n\n2D\n\n(a)\n\n4.0\n\n\u2206\n\n(b)\n\n4.0\n\nPS\n\nPS\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n3D\n\n\u03c1s\u22600\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nmz\n\n\u03c1s\u22600\n\n0.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nmz\n\nFIG. 4: The ground state phase diagrams of the (a) 2D and\n(b) 3D spin-1/2 XXZ models on the parameter space of\nanisotropic constant \u2206 and magnetization mz .

Based on the calculated ground state phase diagrams, the existence of a phase-separated region and the\nabsence of supersolid phases are pointed out in the related systems of hard core bosons with nearest-neighbor\nrepulsions.\n\nIt would be of great interest to study effects of random anisotropic constant \u2206 on the phase diagrams [22]\nsince one can elucidate quantum effects on recently proposed impurity-induced quantum-critical-point-like behavior near f irst-order phase transitions in the Ising\nmodels [23]. Another interesting issue to address is to\nsee effects of long-ranged Coulomb repulsions between\nbosons on the phase-separated region in the phase diagram. There is a general belief that introducing the\nCoulomb interactions replaces the phase-separated state\nby thermodynamically stable states such as a droplet-like\nstate and perhaps a stripe state [24]. The model studied\nhere provide an ideal system to examine the possibilities\nof those exotic states using unbiased numerical methods.\n\nThe author thanks E. Dagotto and A. Dorneich for\nvaluable discussions.\n\n[15] Except for \u2206 \u223c 1.0 for which we have to go down to lower\ntemperatures to see a clear jump in the magnetization\ncurve.\n[16] For the corresponding boson system described by Eq. (2),\ndensity of bosons jumps from 0.5 to \u223c 0.39 at critical\nchemical potential \u03bc/t \u223c 2.35, which is in good agreement with the results of Fig.3 in Ref. [14] where the\ncanonical ensemble was used.\n[17] See, for example, N. Kawashima, J. E. Gubernatis, and\nH. G. Evertz, Phys. Rev. B 50, 136 (1994).\n[18] E. L. Pollock and D. M. Ceperley, Phys. Rev.
