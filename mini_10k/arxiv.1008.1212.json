Introduction\nCyclic cohomology was discovered by Alain Connes no later than 1981 and in\nfact it was announced in that year in a conference in Oberwolfach [5]. I have\nreproduced the text of his abstract below. As it appears in his report, one of\nConnes' main motivations to introduce cyclic cohomology theory came from index\ntheory on foliated spaces. Let (V, F ) be a compact foliated manifold and let V /F\ndenote the space of leaves of (V, F ). This space, with its natural quotient topology,\nis, in general, a highly singular space and in noncommutative geometry one usually\nreplaces the quotient space V /F with a noncommutative algebra A = C \u2217 (V, F )\ncalled the foliation algebra of (V, F ). It is the convolution algebra of the holonomy\ngroupoid of the foliation and is a C \u2217 -algebra. It has a dense subalgebra A =\nC \u221e (V, F ) which plays the role of the algebra of smooth functions on V /F . Let D\nbe a transversally elliptic operator on (V, F ). The analytic index of D, index(D) \u2208\nK0 (A), is an element of the K-theory of A. This should be compared with the family\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Connes realized that to identify this class\nby a cohomological expression it would be necessary to have a noncommutative\nanalogue of the Chern character, i.e., a map from K0 (A) to a, then unknown,\ncohomology theory for the noncommutative algebra A. This theory, now known\nas cyclic cohomology, would then play the role of the noncommutative analogue\nof de Rham homology of currents for smooth manifolds. Its dual version, cyclic\nhomology, corresponds, in the commutative case, to de Rham cohomology.\nConnes arrived at his definition of cyclic cohomology by a careful analysis of the\nalgebraic structures deeply hidden in the (super)traces of products of commutators\nof operators. These expressions are directly defined in terms of an elliptic operator\nand its parametrix and give the index of the operator when paired with a K-theory\nclass. In his own words [5]:\n\"The transverse elliptic theory for foliations requires as a preliminary step a\npurely algebraic work, of computing for a noncommutative algebra A the cohomology\nof the following complex: n-cochains are multilinear functions\n\u03c6(f 0 , . . . , f n ) of f 0 , . . . , f n \u2208 A where\n\u03c6(f 1 , . . . , f 0 ) = (\u22121)n \u03c6(f 0 , . . . , f n )\n\nand the boundary is\nb\u03c6(f 0 , . . . , f n+1 )\n\n= \u03c6(f 0 f 1 , . . . , f n+1 ) \u2212 \u03c6(f 0 , f 1 f 2 , . . . , f n+1 ) + * * *\n+(\u22121)n+1 \u03c6(f n+1 f 0 , . . . , f n ).\n\nThe basic class associated to a transversally elliptic operator, for A = the algebra\nof the foliation, is given by:\nwhere\n\n\u03c6(f 0 , . . . , f n ) = T race (\u03b5F [F, f 0 ][F, f 1 ] * * * [F, f n ]),\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 Q\n1\n, \u03b5=\nP 0\n0\nand Q is a parametrix of P .

It gives the index of the operator from\nits associated class \u03c6. Moreover he, \u03c6i = he, S\u03c6i, so that the important group\nto determine is the inductive limit Hp = Lim H n (A) for the map S. Using the\n\u2192\n\ntools of homological algebra the groups H n (A, A\u2217 ) of Hochschild cohomology with\ncoefficients in the bimodule A\u2217 are easier to determine and the solution of the\nproblem is obtained in two steps:\n1) the construction of a map\nB : H n (A, A\u2217 ) \u2192 H n\u22121 (A)\n\nand the proof of a long exact sequence\nB\n\nS\n\nI\n\n* * * \u2192 H n (A, A\u2217 ) \u2192 H n\u22121 (A) \u2192 H n+1 (A) \u2192 H n+1 (A, A\u2217 ) \u2192 * * *\n\nwhere I is the obvious map from the cohomology of the above complex to the\nHochschild cohomology;\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n3\n\n2) the construction of a spectral sequence with E2 term given by the cohomology\nof the degree \u22121 differential I \u25e6 B on the Hochschild groups H n (A, A\u2217 ) and which\nconverges strongly to a graded group associated to the inductive limit.\nThis purely algebraic theory is then used. For A = C \u221e (V ) one gets the de Rham\nhomology of currents, and for the pseudo-torus, i.e. the algebra of the Kronecker\nfoliation, one finds that the Hochschild cohomology depends on the Diophantine nature of the rotation number while the above theory gives Hp0 of dimension 2 and Hp1\nof dimension 2, as expected, but from some remarkable cancellations.\"\nA full exposition of these results later appeared in two IHES preprints [6], and\nwere eventually published as [9]. With the appearance of [9] one could say that\nthe first stage of the development of noncommutative geometry and specially cyclic\ncohomology reached a stage of maturity. In the next few sections I shall try to give\na quick and concise survey of some aspects of cyclic cohomology theory as they\nwere developed in [9]. The last two sections are devoted to developments in the\nsubject after [9] arising from the work of Connes.\nIt is a distinct honor and a great pleasure to dedicate this short survey of cyclic\ncohomology theory as a small token of our friendship to Alain Connes, the originator\nof the subject, on the occasion of his 60th birthday. It inevitably only covers part\nof what has been done by Alain in this very important corner of noncommutative\ngeometry. It is impossible to cover everything, and in particular I have left out\nmany important topics developed by him including, among others, the GodbillonVey invariant and type III factors [8], the transverse fundamental class for foliations\n[8], the Novikov conjecture for hyperbolic groups [18], entire cyclic cohomology [10],\nand multiplicative characteristic classes [12]. Finally I would like to thank Farzad\nFathi zadeh for carefully reading the text and for several useful comments, and\nArthur Greenspoon who kindly edited the whole text.\n2. Cyclic cohomology\nCyclic cohomology can be defined in several ways, each shedding light on a\ndifferent aspect of it. Its original definition [5, 9] was through a remarkable subcomplex of the Hochschild complex that we recall first. By algebra in this paper\nwe mean an associative algebra over C. For an algebra A let\nC n (A) = Hom(A\u2297(n+1) , C),\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . ,\n\ndenote the space of (n + 1)-linear functionals on A. These are our n-cochains. The\nHochschild differential b : C n (A) \u2192 C n+1 (A) is defined as\n(b\u03c6)(a0 , . . . , an+1 ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03c6(a0 , . . . , ai ai+1 , . . . , an+1 )\n\ni=0\n\n+(\u22121)n+1 \u03c6(an+1 a0 , . . . , an ).\nThe cohomology of the complex (C \u2217 (A), b) is the Hochschild cohomology of A with\ncoefficients in the bimodule A\u2217 .\nThe following definition is fundamental and marks the departure from Hochschild\ncohomology in [5, 9]:\nDefinition 2.1. An n-cochain \u03c6 \u2208 C n (A) is called cyclic if\n\n\u03c6(an , a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) = (\u22121)n \u03c6(a0 , a1 , . . . , an )\n\n\f4\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nfor all a0 , . . . , an in A. The space of cyclic n-cochains will be denoted by C\u03bbn (A).\nJust why, of all possible symmetry conditions on cochains, the cyclic property\nis a reasonable choice is at first glance not at all clear.\nLemma 2.1. The space of cyclic cochains is invariant under the action of b, i.e.,\nb C\u03bbn (A) \u2282 C\u03bbn+1 (A) for all n \u2265 0.\nC\n\nTo see this one introduces the operators \u03bb : C n (A) \u2192 C n (A) and b\u2032 : C n (A) \u2192\n(A) by\n\nn+1\n\n(\u03bb\u03c6)(a0 , . . . , an ) =\n(b\u2032 \u03c6)(a0 , . . . , an+1 ) =\n\n(\u22121)n \u03c6(an , a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ),\nn\nX\n(\u22121)i \u03c6(a0 , . . . , ai ai+1 , . . . , an+1 ),\ni=0\n\n\u2032\n\nand checks that (1 \u2212 \u03bb)b = b (1 \u2212 \u03bb). Since C\u03bb\u2217 (A) = Ker (1 \u2212 \u03bb), the lemma is\nproved.\nWe therefore have a subcomplex of the Hochschild complex, called the cyclic\ncomplex of A:\n(1)\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nC\u03bb0 (A) \u2212\u2192 C\u03bb1 (A) \u2212\u2192 C\u03bb2 (A) \u2212\u2192 * * * .\n\nDefinition 2.2. The cohomology of the cyclic complex (1) is the cyclic cohomology\nof A and will be denoted by HC n (A), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\nAnd that is Connes' first definition of cyclic cohomology. A cocycle for the\ncyclic cohomology group HC n (A) is called a cyclic n-cocycle on A. It is an (n + 1)linear functional \u03c6 on A which satisfies the two conditions:\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c6 = 0,\n\nand b\u03c6 = 0.\n\nThe inclusion of complexes\n(2)\n\n(C\u03bb\u2217 (A), b) \u0592\u2192 (C \u2217 (A), b)\n\ninduces a map I from cyclic cohomology to Hochschild cohomology:\nI : HC n (A) \u2212\u2192 HH n (A),\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n\nA closer inspection of the long exact sequence associated to (2), yields Connes'\nlong exact sequence relating Hochschild cohomology to cyclic cohomology. This is\nhowever easier said than done. The reason is that to identify the cohomology of\nthe quotient one must use another long exact sequence, and combine the two long\nexact sequences to obtain the result. To simplify the notation, let us denote the\nHochschild and cyclic complexes by C and C\u03bb , respectively. Then (2) gives us an\nexact sequence of complexes\n(3)\n\n\u03c0\n\n0 \u2192 C\u03bb \u2192 C \u2192 C/C\u03bb \u2192 0.\n\nIts associated long exact sequence is\n(4)\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 HC n (A) \u2212\u2192 HH n (A) \u2212\u2192 H n (C/C\u03bb ) \u2212\u2192 HC n+1 (A) \u2212\u2192 * * *\n\nWe need to identify the cohomology groups H n (C/C\u03bb ). To this end, consider the\nshort exact sequence of complexes\n(5)\n\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\nN\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 C/C\u03bb \u2212\u2192 (C, b\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 C\u03bb \u2212\u2192 0,\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n5\n\nwhere the operator N is defined by\nN = 1 + \u03bb + \u03bb2 + * * * + \u03bbn : C n \u2212\u2192 C n .\nThe relations (1 \u2212 \u03bb)b = b\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bb), N (1 \u2212 \u03bb) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)N = 0, and bN = N b\u2032\nshow that 1 \u2212 \u03bb and N are morphisms of complexes in (5). As for the exactness\nof (5), the only nontrivial part is to show that ker (N ) \u2282 im (1 \u2212 \u03bb), which can be\nverified. Assuming A is unital, the middle complex (C, b\u2032 ) in (5) can be shown to be\nexact with a contracting homotopy s : C n \u2192 C n\u22121 defined by (s\u03c6)(a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) =\n(\u22121)n\u22121 \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an\u22121 , 1), which satisfies b\u2032 s + sb\u2032 = id.

Remarkably, there is a formula for B on the\nlevel of cochains given by B = N B0 , where B0 : C n \u2192 C n\u22121 is defined by\nB0 \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) = \u03c6(1, a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) \u2212 (\u22121)n \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an\u22121 , 1).\nUsing the relations (1 \u2212 \u03bb)b = b\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bb), (1 \u2212 \u03bb)N = N (1 \u2212 \u03bb) = 0, bN = N b\u2032 , and\nsb\u2032 + b\u2032 s = 1, one shows that\n(9)\n\nbB + Bb = 0,\n\nand B 2 = 0.\n\nUsing the periodicity operator S, the periodic cyclic cohomology of A is then\ndefined as the direct limit of cyclic cohomology groups under the operator S:\nHP i (A) := Lim HC 2n+i (A),\n\u2212\u2192\n\ni = 0, 1.\n\nNotice that since S has degree 2, there are only two periodic groups. These periodic\ngroups have better stability properties compared to cyclic cohomology groups. For\nexample, they are homotopy invariant, and they pair with K-theory.\nA much deeper relationship between Hochschild and cyclic cohomology groups\nis encoded in Connes' (b, B)-bicomplex and the associated Connes spectral sequence\nthat we shall briefly recall now. Consider the relations (9). The (b, B)-bicomplex\n\n\f6\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nof a unital algebra A, denoted by B (A), is the bicomplex\n..\n.\n\n..\n.\n\n..\n.\n\nB\n\nB\n\nC 2 (A) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C 1 (A) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C 0 (A)\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nb\uf8e6\nb\uf8e6\nB\n\nC 1 (A) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C 0 (A)\nx\n\uf8e6\nb\uf8e6\nC 0 (A)\n\nAs usual, there are two spectral sequences attached to this bicomplex. The following fundamental result of Connes [9] shows that the spectral sequence obtained\nfrom filtration by rows converges to cyclic cohomology. Notice that the E 1 term of\nthis spectral sequence is the Hochschild cohomology of A.\nTheorem 2.1. The map \u03c6 7\u2192 (0, . . . , 0, \u03c6) is a quasi-isomorphism of complexes\n(C\u03bb\u2217 (A), b) \u2192 (Tot B (A), b + B).\n\nThis is a consequence of the vanishing of the E 2 term of the second spectral\nsequence (filtration by columns) of B(A). To prove this, Connes considers the short\nexact sequence of b-complexes\n0 \u2212\u2192 Im B \u2212\u2192 Ker B \u2212\u2192 Ker B/Im B \u2212\u2192 0,\nand proves that ([9], Lemma 41), the induced map\nHb (Im B) \u2212\u2192 Hb (Ker B)\nis an isomorphism. This is a very technical result. It follows that Hb (Ker B/Im B)\nvanishes. To take care of the first column one appeals to the fact that Im B \u2243\nKer (1 \u2212 \u03bb) is the space of cyclic cochains.\nWe give an alternative proof of Theorem (2.1) above.

This can\nbe done by explicit formulas. Consider the chain maps\nI : Tot B(A) \u2192 Tot C(A),\n\nJ : Tot C(A)\n\nI = id + N s,\n\n\u2192 Tot B(A),\n\nJ = id + sN.\n\nIt can be directly verified that the following operators define chain homotopy equivalences:\ng : Tot B(A) \u2192 Tot B(A),\nh : Tot C(A) \u2192 Tot C(A),\n\ng = N s 2 B0 ,\nh = s.\n\nTo give an example of an application of the spectral sequence of Theorem\n(2.1), let me recall Connes' computation of the continuous cyclic cohomology of\nthe topological algebra A = C \u221e (M ), i.e., the algebra of smooth complex valued\nfunctions on a closed smooth n-dimensional manifold M . This example is important\nsince, apart from its applications, it clearly shows that cyclic cohomology is a\nnoncommutative analogue of de Rham homology.\nThe continuous analogues of Hochschild and cyclic cohomology for topological\nalgebras are defined as follows [9]. Let A be a topological algebra. A continuous\ncochain on A is a jointly continuous multilinear map \u03c6 : A \u00d7 A \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 A \u2192 C.\nBy working with just continuous cochains, as opposed to all cochains, one obtains\nthe continuous analogues of Hochschild and cyclic cohomology groups. In working\nwith algebras of smooth functions (both in the commutative and noncommutative\ncase), it is essential to use this continuous analogue.\nThe topology of C \u221e (M ) is defined by the sequence of seminorms\nkf kn = sup |\u2202 \u03b1 f |,\n\n|\u03b1| \u2264 n,\n\nwhere the supremum is over a fixed, finite, coordinate cover for M . Under this\ntopology, C \u221e (M ) is a locally convex, in fact nuclear, topological algebra. Similarly\none topologizes the space of p-forms on M for all p \u2265 0. Let\n\u03a9p M := Homcont (\u03a9p M, C)\n\ndenote the continuous dual of the space of p\u2212forms on M . Elements of \u03a9p M are\ncalled de Rham p-currents. By dualizing the de Rham differential d, we obtain a\ndifferential d\u2217 : \u03a9\u2217 M \u2192 \u03a9\u2217\u22121 M , and a complex, called the de Rham complex of\ncurrents on M :\nd\u2217\n\nd\u2217\n\nd\u2217\n\n\u03a90 M \u2190\u2212 \u03a91 M \u2190\u2212 \u03a92 M \u2190\u2212 * * * .\n\nThe homology of this complex is the de Rham homology of M and we denote it by\nH\u2217dR (M ).\nIt is easy to check that for any m-current C, closed or not, the cochain\n(10)\n\n\u03c6C (f0 , f1 , . . . , fm ) := hC, f0 df1 * * * dfm i,\n\nis a continuous Hochschild cocycle on C \u221e (M ). Now if C is closed, then one checks\nthat \u03c6C is a cyclic m-cocycle on C \u221e (M ). Thus we obtain natural maps\n(11)\n\nm\n\u03a9m M \u2192 HHcont\n(C \u221e (M ))\n\nand\n(12)\n\nm\nZm M \u2192 HCcont\n(C \u221e (M )),\n\n\f8\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nwhere Zm (M ) \u2282 \u03a9m M is the space of closed m-currents on M . For example, if M\nis oriented and C represents its orientation class, then\nZ\n(13)\n\u03c6C (f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ) =\nf0 df1 * * * dfn ,\nM\n\nwhich is easily checked to be a cyclic n-cocycle on A.\nIn [9], using an explicit resolution, Connes shows that (11) is a quasi-isomorphism. Thus we have a natural isomorphism between space of de Rham currents on\nM and the continuous Hochschild cohomology of C \u221e (M ) :\n(14)\n\ni\n(C \u221e (M )) \u2243 \u03a9i M\nHHcont\n\ni = 0, 1, . . .\n\nTo compute the continuous cyclic homology of A, one first observes that under the\nisomorphism (14) the operator B corresponds to the de Rham differential d\u2217 . More\nprecisely, for each integer n \u2265 0 there is a commutative diagram:\n\u03bc\n\n\u03a9n+1 M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C n+1 (A)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u2217\n\uf8e6\nyd\nyB\n\u03a9n M\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nC n (A)\n\nwhere \u03bc(C) = \u03c6C and \u03c6C is defined by (10). Then, using the spectral sequence of\nTheorem (2.1) and the isomorphism (14), Connes obtains [9]:\n(15)\n\nn\ndR\nHCcont\n(C \u221e (M )) \u2243 Zn (M ) \u2295 Hn\u22122\n(M ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 HkdR (M ),\n\nwhere k = 0 if n is even and k = 1 is n is odd. For the continuous periodic cyclic\ncohomology he obtains\nM\ndR\nk\nH2i+k\n(M ), k = 0, 1.\n(16)\nHPcont\n(C \u221e (M )) \u2243\ni\n\nWe shall also briefly recall Connes' computation of the Hochschild and cyclic\ncohomology of smooth noncommutative tori [9]. This result already appeared in\nConnes' Oberwolfach report [5]. When \u03b8 is rational, the smooth noncommutative\ntorus A\u03b8 can be shown to be Morita equivalent to C \u221e (T 2 ), the algebra of smooth\nfunctions on the 2-torus. One can then use Morita invariance of Hochschild and\ncyclic cohomology to reduce the computation of these groups to those for the algebra\nC \u221e (T 2 ). This takes care of rational \u03b8. So we can assume \u03b8 is irrational and we\ndenote the generators of A\u03b8 by U and V with the relation V U = \u03bbU V , where\n\u03bb = e2\u03c0i\u03b8 .\nRecall that an irrational number \u03b8 is said to satisfy a Diophantine condition if\n|1 \u2212 \u03bbn |\u22121 = O(nk ) for some positive integer k.\nProposition 2.1. ([9]) Let \u03b8 \u2208\n/ Q. Then\na) One has HH 0 (A\u03b8 ) = C,\nb) If \u03b8 satisfies a Diophantine condition then HH i (A\u03b8 ) is 2-dimensional for i=1\nand is 1-dimensional for i = 2,\nc) If \u03b8 does not satisfy a Diophantine condition, then HH i (A\u03b8 ) are infinite dimensional non-Hausdorff spaces for i = 1, 2.\nRemarkably, for all values of \u03b8, the periodic cyclic cohomology is finite dimensional and is given by\nHP 0 (A\u03b8 ) = C2 ,\n\nHP 1 (A\u03b8 ) = C2 .\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n9\n\nAn explicit basis for these groups are given by cyclic 1-cocycles\n\u03c61 (a0 , a1 ) = \u03c4 (a0 \u03b41 (a1 )),\n\nand \u03c61 (a0 , a1 ) = \u03c4 (a0 \u03b42 (a1 ))\n\nand cyclic 2-cocycles\n\u03c6(a0 , a1 , a2 ) = \u03c4 (a0 (\u03b41 (a1 )\u03b42 (a2 ) \u2212 \u03b42 (a1 )\u03b41 (a2 ))),\n\nand S\u03c4,\n\nwhere \u03b41 , \u03b42 : A\u03b8 \u2192 A\u03b8 are the canonical derivations defined by\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b41 (\namn U m V n ) =\nmamn U m V n ,\n\u03b42 (U m V n ) =\nnamn U m V n ,\n\nand \u03c4 : A\u03b8 \u2192 C is the canonical trace.\nA noncommutative generalization of formulas like (13) was introduced in [9]\nand played an important role in the development of cyclic cohomology theory in\ngeneral. It gives a geometric meaning to the notion of a cyclic cocycle over an\nalgebra and goes as follows. Let (\u03a9, d) be a differential graded algebra. A closed\ngraded trace of dimension n on (\u03a9, d) is a linear map\nZ\n: \u03a9n \u2212\u2192 C\nsuch that\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 = 0,\n\nand\n\nZ\n\n[\u03c91 , \u03c92 ] = 0,\n\nfor all \u03c9 in \u03a9n\u22121 , \u03c91 in \u03a9Ri , \u03c92 in \u03a9j and\nR i + j = n. An n dimensional cycle over an\nalgebra A is a triple (\u03a9, , \u03c1), where is an n-dimensional closed gradedR trace on\n(\u03a9, d) and \u03c1 : A \u2192 \u03a90 is an algebra homomorphism. Given a cycle (\u03a9, , \u03c1) over\nA, its character is the cyclic n-cocycle on A defined by\nZ\n(17)\n\u03c6(a0 , a1 , . . . , an ) = \u03c1(a0 )d\u03c1(a1 ) * * * d\u03c1(an ).\nConversely one shows that all cyclic cocycles are obtained in this way.\nOnce one has the definition of cyclic cohomology, it is not difficult to formulate\na dual notion of cyclic homology and a pairing between the two. Let Cn (A) =\nA\u2297(n+1) . The analogues of the operators b, b\u2032 and \u03bb are easily defined on C\u2217 (A)\nand are usually denoted by the same letters, as we do here. For example b :\nCn (A) \u2192 Cn\u22121 (A) is defined by\n(18)\n\nb(a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) =\n\n(19)\n\n+\n\nLet\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u22121)i (a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ai ai+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an )\n\n(\u22121)n (an a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an\u22121 ).\n\nCn\u03bb (A) := Cn (A)/Im(1 \u2212 \u03bb).\nThe relation (1 \u2212 \u03bb)b\u2032 = b(1 \u2212 \u03bb) shows that the operator b is well defined on\nC\u2217\u03bb (A). The complex (C\u2217\u03bb (A), b) is called the homological cyclic complex of A and\nits homology, denoted by HCn (A), n = 0, 1, . . . , is the cyclic homology of A. The\nevaluation map h\u03c6, (a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an )i 7\u2192 \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an ) clearly defines a degree zero\npairing HC \u2217 (A)\u2297HC\u2217 (A) \u2192 C. Many results of cyclic cohomology theory, such as\nConnes' long exact sequence and spectral sequence, and Morita invariance, continue\nto hold for cyclic homology theory with basically the same proofs.\nAnother important idea of Connes in the 1980's was the introduction of entire\ncyclic cohomology of Banach algebras [10]. This allows one to deal with algebras of\n\n\f10\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nfunctions on infinite dimensional (noncommutative) spaces such as those appearing\nin constructive quantum field theory. These algebras typically don't carry finitely\nsummable Fredholm modules, but in some cases have so-called \u03b8-summable Fredholm modules. In [10] Connes extends the definition of Chern character to such\nFredholm modules with values in entire cyclic cohomology.\nAfter the appearance of [9], cyclic (co)homology theory took on many lives\nand was further developed along distinct lines, including a purely algebraic one,\nwith a big impact on algebraic K-theory. The cyclic cohomology of many algebras\nwas later computed including the very important case of group algebras [2] and\ngroupoid algebras. For many of these more algebraic aspects of the theory we refer\nto [33, 32] and references therein.\n3. From K-homology to cyclic cohomology\nAs I said in the introduction, Connes' original motivation for the development\nof cyclic cohomology was to give a receptacle for a noncommutative Chern character\nmap on the K-homology of noncommutative algebras. The cycles of K-homology\ncan be represented by, even or odd, Fredholm modules. Here we just focus on the\nodd case, and we refer to [9, 13] for the even case. Given a Hilbert space H, let\nL(H) denote the algebra of bounded linear operators on H, and K(H) denote the\nalgebra of compact operators. Also, for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, let Lp (H) denote the Schatten\nideal of p-summable operators. By definition, T \u2208 Lp (H) if |T |p is a trace class\noperator.\nDefinition 3.1. An odd Fredholm module over a unital algebra A is a pair (H, F )\nwhere\n1. H is a Hilbert space endowed with a representation\n\u03c0 : A \u2212\u2192 L(H),\n\n2. F \u2208 L(H) is a bounded selfadjoint operator with F 2 = I,\n3. For all a \u2208 A we have\n(20)\n\n[F, \u03c0(a)] = F \u03c0(a) \u2212 \u03c0(a)F \u2208 K(H).\n\nA Fredholm module (H, F ) is called p-summable if, instead of (20), we have\nthe stronger condition:\n(21)\n\n[F, \u03c0(a)] \u2208 Lp (H)\n\nfor all a \u2208 A.\nTo give a simple example, let A = C(S 1 ) be the algebra of continuous functions\non the circle and let A act on H = L2 (S 1 ) as multiplication operators. Let F (en ) =\nen if n \u2265 0 and F (en ) = \u2212en for n < 0, where en (x) = e2\u03c0inx , n \u2208 Z, denotes the\nstandard orthonormal basis of H. Clearly F is selfadjoint and F 2 = I. P\nTo show that\n[F, \u03c0(f )] is a compact operator for all f \u2208 C(S 1 ), notice that if f = |n|\u2264N an en\nis a finite trigonometric sum then [F, \u03c0(f )] is a finite rank operator and hence is\ncompact. In general we can uniformly approximate a continuous function by a\ntrigonometric sum and show that the commutator is compact for any continuous\nf . This shows that (H, F ) is an odd Fredholm module over C(S 1 ). This Fredholm\nmodule is not p-summable for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. If we restrict it to the subalgebra\nC \u221e (S 1 ) of smooth functions, then it can be checked that (H, F ) is in fact psummable for all p > 1, but is not 1-summable even in this case.\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n11\n\nNow let me describe Connes' noncommutative Chern character from K-homology\nto cyclic cohomology. Let (H, F ) be an odd p-summable Fredholm module over an\nalgebra A. For any odd integer 2n \u2212 1 such that 2n \u2265 p, Connes defines a cyclic\n(2n \u2212 1)-cocycle \u03c62n\u22121 on A by [9]\n(22)\n\n\u03c62n\u22121 (a0 , a1 , . . . , a2n\u22121 ) = Tr (F [F, a0 ][F, a1 ] * * * [F, a2n\u22121 ]),\n\nwhere Tr denotes the operator trace and instead of \u03c0(a) we simply write a. Notice\nthat by our p-summability assumption, each commutator is in Lp (H) and hence,\nby H\u00f6lder inequality for Schatten class operators, their product is in fact a trace\nclass operator as soon as 2n \u2265 p. One checks by a direct computation that \u03c62n\u22121\nis a cyclic cocycle.\nThe next proposition shows that these cyclic cocycles are related to each other\nvia the periodicity S-operator of cyclic cohomology. This is probably how Connes\ncame across the periodicity operator S in the first place.\nProposition 3.1. For all n with 2n \u2265 p we have\n\nS\u03c62n\u22121 = \u2212(n + 21 ) \u03c62n+1 .\n\nBy rescaling \u03c62n\u22121 's, one obtains a well defined element in the periodic cyclic\ncohomology. The (unstable) odd Connes-Chern character Ch2n\u22121 = Ch2n\u22121 (H, F )\nof an odd finitely summable Fredholm module (H, F ) over A is defined by rescaling\nthe cocycles \u03c62n\u22121 appropriately. Let\nCh2n\u22121 (a0 , . . . , a2n\u22121 ) := (\u22121)n 2(n \u2212 12 ) * * * 12 Tr (F [F, a0 ][F, a1 ] * * * [F, a2n\u22121 ]).\nDefinition 3.2. The Connes-Chern character of an odd p-summable Fredholm\nmodule (H, F ) over an algebra A is the class of the cyclic cocycle Ch2n\u22121 in the\nodd periodic cyclic cohomology group HP odd(A).\nBy the above Proposition, the class of Ch2n\u22121 in HP odd (A) is independent of\nthe choice of n.\nLet us compute the character of the Fredholm module of the above Example\nwith A = C \u221e (S 1 ). By the above definition, Ch1 (H, F ) = [\u03c61 ] is the class of the\nfollowing cyclic 1-cocycle in HP odd (A) :\n\u03c61 (f0 , f1 ) = Tr (F [F, f0 ][F, f1 ]).\nOne can identify this cyclic cocycle with a local formula. We claim that\nZ\n4\n\u03c61 (f0 , f1 ) =\nf0 df1 , for all f0 , f1 \u2208 A.\n2\u03c0i\nBy linearity, It suffices to check this relation for basis elements f0 = em , f1 = en\nfor all m, n \u2208 Z, which is easy to do.\nThe duality, that is, the bilinear pairing, between K-theory and K-homology\nis defined through the Fredholm index. More precisely there is an index pairing\nbetween odd (resp. even) Fredholm modules over A and the algebraic K-theory\ngroup K1alg (A) (resp. K0 (A)). We shall describe it only in the odd case at hand.\nLet (H, F ) be an odd Fredholm module over A and let U \u2208 A\u00d7 be an invertible\n: H \u2192 H be the projection operator defined by F .\nelement in A. Let P = F +1\n2\nOne checks that the operator\nPUP : PH \u2192 PH\n\n\f12\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nis a Fredholm operator. In fact, using the compactness of commutators [F, a], one\nchecks that P U \u22121 P is an inverse for P U P modulo compact operators, which of\ncourse implies that P U P is a Fredholm operator. The index pairing is then defined\nas\nh(H, F ), [U ]i := index (P U P ),\n\nwhere the index on the right hand side is the Fredholm index. If the invertible\nU happens to be in Mn (A) we can apply this definition to the algebra Mn (A) by\nnoticing that (H \u2297 Cn , F \u2297 1) is a Fredholm module over Mn (A) in a natural way.\nThe resulting map can be shown to induce a well defined additive map\nh(H, F ), \u2212i : K1alg (A) \u2192 C.\nNotice that this map is purely topological in the sense that to define it we did not\nhave to impose any finite summability, i.e., smoothness, condition on the Fredholm\nmodule.\nGoing back to our example and choosing f : S 1 \u2192 GL1 (C) a continuous function on S 1 representing an element of K1alg (C(S 1 )), the index pairing h[(H, F )], [f ]i =\nindex(P f P ) can be explicitly calculated. In fact in this case a simple homotopy\nargument gives the index of the Toeplitz operator P f P : P H \u2192 P H in terms of the\nwinding number of f around the origin:\nh[(H, F )], [f ]i = \u2212W (f, 0).\nOf course, when f is smooth the winding number can be computed by integrating\n1 dz\nthe 1-form 2\u03c0i\nz over the curve defined by f :\nZ\n1\n1\n\u03c6(f \u22121 , f )\nf \u22121 df =\nW (f, 0) =\n2\u03c0i\n2\u03c0i\nR\nwhere \u03c6 is the cyclic 1-cocycle on C \u221e (S 1 ) defined by \u03c6(f, g) = f dg. This is\na special case of a very general index formula proved by Connes [9] in a fully\nnoncommutative situation:\nProposition 3.2. Let (H, F ) be an odd p-summable Fredholm module over an\nalgebra A and let 2n \u2212 1 be an odd integer such that 2n \u2265 p. If u is an invertible\nelement in A then\n(\u22121)n\nindex (P uP ) = 2n \u03c62n\u22121 (u\u22121 , u, . . . , u\u22121 , u),\n2\nwhere the cyclic cocycle \u03c62n\u22121 is defined by\n\u03c62n\u22121 (a0 , a1 , . . . , a2n\u22121 ) = Tr (F [F, a0 ][F, a1 ] * * * [F, a2n\u22121 ]).\nThe above index formula can be expressed in a more conceptual manner once\nConnes' Chern character in K-theory is introduced. In [4, 9], Connes shows that\nthe Chern-Weil definition of Chern character on topological K-theory admits a vast\ngeneralization to a noncommutative setting. For a noncommutative algebra A and\neach integer n \u2265 0, he defined pairings between cyclic cohomology and K-theory:\n(23)\n\nHC 2n (A) \u2297 K0 (A) \u2212\u2192 C,\n\nHC 2n+1 (A) \u2297 K1alg (A) \u2212\u2192 C.\n\nThese pairings are compatible with the periodicity operator S in cyclic cohomology\nin the sense that\nh[\u03c6], [e]i = hS[\u03c6], [e]i,\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n13\n\nfor all cyclic cocycles \u03c6 and K-theory classes [e], and thus induce a pairing\nHP i (A) \u2297 Kialg (A) \u2212\u2192 C,\n\ni = 0, 1\n\nbetween periodic cyclic cohomology and K-theory.\nWe briefly recall its definition. Let \u03c6 be a cyclic 2n-cocycle on A and let\ne \u2208 Mk (A) be an idempotent representing a class in K0 (A). The pairing HC 2n (A)\u2297\nK0 (A) \u2212\u2192 C is defined by\nh[\u03c6], [e]i = (n!)\u22121 \u03c6\u0303(e, . . . , e),\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0303 is the 'extension' of \u03c6 to Mk (A) defined by the formula\n(25)\n\n\u03c6\u0303(m0 \u2297 a0 , . . . , m2n \u2297 a2n ) = tr(m0 * * * m2n )\u03c6(a0 , . . . , a2n ).\n\nIt can be shown that \u03c6\u0303 is a cyclic n-cocycle as well.\nThe formulas in the odd case are as follows. Given an invertible matrix u \u2208\nMk (A), representing a class in K1alg (A), and an odd cyclic (2n \u2212 1)-cocycle \u03c6 on\nA, the pairing is given by\n(26)\n\nh[\u03c6], [u]i :=\n\n2\u2212(2n+1)\n\u03c6\u0303(u\u22121 \u2212 1, u \u2212 1, . . . , u\u22121 \u2212 1, u \u2212 1).\n(n \u2212 21 ) * * * 12\n\nAny cyclic cocycle can be represented by a normalized cocycle for which \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an ) =\n0 if ai = 1 for some i. When \u03c6 is normalized, formula (26) reduces to a particularly\nsimple form:\n(27)\n\nh[\u03c6], [u]i =\n\n2\u2212(2n+1)\n\u03c6\u0303(u\u22121 , u, . . . , u\u22121 , u).\n(n \u2212 21 ) * * * 12\n\nUsing the pairing HC 2n\u22121 (A)\u2297K1alg (A) \u2192 C and the definition of Ch2n\u22121 (H, F ),\nthe above index formula in Proposition (3.2) can be written as\n(28)\nor in its stable form\n\nindex (P uP ) = hCh2n\u22121 (H, F ), [u]i,\nindex (P uP ) = hChodd (H, F ), [u]i.\n\nThis equality amounts to the equality Topological Index = Analytic Index in a fully\nnoncommutative setting.\nAn immediate consequence of the index formula (28) is an integrality theorem\nfor numbers defined by the right hand side of (28). This should be compared\nwith classical integrality results for topological invariants of manifolds that are\nestablished through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. An early nice application\nwas Connes' proof of the idempotent conjecture for group C \u2217 -algebras of free groups\nin [9]. Among other applications I should mention a mathematical treatment of\nintegral quantum Hall effect, and most recently to quantum computing in the work\nof Mike Freedman and collaborators [29].\n4. Cyclic modules\nWith the introduction of the cyclic category \u039b in [7], Connes took another major\nstep in conceptualizing and generalizing cyclic cohomology far beyond its original\ninception. We already saw in the last section three different definitions of the cyclic\ncohomology of an algebra through explicit complexes. The original motivation of\n[7] was to define the cyclic cohomology of algebras as a derived functor. Since\nthe category of algebras and algebra homomorphisms is not an additive category,\n\n\f14\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nthe standard abelian homological algebra is not applicable here. Let k be a unital\ncommutative ring. In [7], an abelian category \u039bk of cyclic k-modules is defined\nthat can be thought of as the 'abelianization' of the category of k-algebras. Cyclic\ncohomology is then shown to be the derived functor of the functor of traces, as we\nshall explain in this section. More generally Connes defined the notion of a cyclic\nobject in an abelian category and its cyclic cohomology [7].\nLater developments proved that this extension of cyclic cohomology was of great\nsignificance. Apart from earlier applications, we should mention the recent work\n[16] where the abelian category of cyclic modules plays a role similar to that of the\ncategory of motives for noncommutative geometry. Another recent example is the\ncyclic cohomology of Hopf algebras [20, 21, 30, 31], which cannot be defined as the\ncyclic cohomology of an algebra or a coalgebra but only as the cyclic cohomology\nof a cyclic module naturally attached to the given Hopf algebra and a coefficient\nsystem (see the last section for more on Hopf cyclic cohomology). Let us briefly\nsketch the definition of the cyclic category \u039b.\nRecall that the simplicial category \u2206 is a small category whose objects are the\ntotally ordered sets\n[n] = {0 < 1 < * * * < n},\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n\nand whose morphisms f : [n] \u2192 [m] are order preserving, i.e. monotone nondecreasing, maps f : {0, 1, . . . , n} \u2192 {0, 1, . . . , m}. Of particular interest among\nthe morphisms of \u2206 are faces \u03b4i and degeneracies \u03c3j ,\n\u03b4i : [n \u2212 1] \u2192 [n],\n\ni = 0, 1, . . . , n,\n\n\u03c3j : [n + 1] \u2192 [n],\nj = 0, 1, . . . , n.\nBy definition \u03b4i is the unique injective morphism missing i and \u03c3j is the unique\nsurjective morphism identifying j with j + 1.\nThe cyclic category \u039b has the same set of objects as \u2206 and in fact contains\n\u2206 as a subcategory. Morphisms of \u039b are generated by simplicial morphisms and\nnew morphisms \u03c4n : [n] \u2192 [n], n \u2265 0, defined by \u03c4n (i) = i + 1 for 0 \u2264 i < n and\n\u03c4n (n) = 0. We have the following extra relations:\n\u03c4n \u03b4i = \u03b4i\u22121 \u03c4n\u22121 ,\n\u03c4n \u03c3i = \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c4n+1 ,\n\n\u03c4n \u03b40 = \u03b4n ,\n\n\u03c4n \u03c30 =\n\u03c4nn+1\n\n2\n\u03c3n \u03c4n+1\n\n= id.\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n\nIt can be shown that the classifying space B\u039b of the small category \u039b is homotopy\nequivalent to the classifying space of the circle S 1 [7].\nA cyclic object in a category C is a functor \u039bop \u2192 C. A cocyclic object in C is\na functor \u039b \u2192 C. For any commutative unital ring k, we denote the category of\ncyclic k-modules by \u039bk . A morphism of cyclic k-modules is a natural transformation\nbetween the corresponding functors. It is clear that \u039bk is an abelian category. More\ngenerally, if A is an abelian category then the category \u039bA of cyclic objects in A\nis itself an abelian category.\nLet Algk denote the category of unital k-algebras and unital algebra homomorphisms. There is a functor\ndefined by\n\n\u266e : Algk \u2212\u2192 \u039bk ,\n\nA 7\u2192 A\u266e ,\n\nA\u266en = A\u2297(n+1) ,\n\nn \u2265 0,\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n15\n\nwith face, degeneracy and cyclic operators given by\n\u03b4i (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) =\n\n\u03b4n (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) =\n\u03c3i (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) =\n\u03c4n (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) =\n\na0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ai ai+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ,\n\nan a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an\u22121 ,\na0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 ai \u2297 1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ,\n\nan \u2297 a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an\u22121 .\n\nA unital algebra map f : A \u2192 B induces a morphism of cyclic modules f \u266e : A\u266e \u2192 B \u266e\nby f \u266e (a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) = (f (a0 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 f (an )).\nThis functor \u266e embeds the non-additive category of k-algebras into the abelian\ncategory of cyclic k-modules. A first main observation of [7] is that\nHom\u039bk (A\u266e , k \u266e ) \u2243 T (A),\nwhere T (A) is the space of traces from A \u2192 k. To a trace \u03c4 one associate the cyclic\nmap (fn )n\u22650 , where\nfn (a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) = \u03c4 (a0 a1 * * * an ),\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\nIt can be easily shown that this defines a one to one correspondence.\nNow we can state the following fundamental theorem of Connes [7] which\ngreatly extends the above observation and shows that cyclic cohomology is a derived functor, in fact an Ext functor, provided that we work in the category of\ncyclic modules:\nTheorem 4.1. Let k be a field of characteristic zero. For any unital k-algebra A,\nthere is a canonical isomorphism\nHC n (A) \u2243 Extn\u039bk (A\u266e , k \u266e ),\n\nfor all n \u2265 0.\n\nApart from their applications in the study of cyclic cohomology of algebras and\nHopf algebras (about the latter see the next section), cyclic modules have also come\nto play an important role in applications of noncommutative geometry to number\ntheory. They play a role similar to that of motives in algebraic geometry. Let me\nbriefly explain this point.\nThe program outlined by Connes, Consani and Marcolli in [16] aims at creating\nan environment where something like Weil's proof of the Riemann hypothesis for\nfunction fields can be repeated in the characteristic zero case. Among other things,\nthey produce an analogue of the Frobenius automorphism in characteristic zero in\nthis paper. Since Connes' trace formula is over the noncommutative ad\u00e8les class\nspace [14], the geometric setting is that of noncommutative geometry and they must\ngo far beyond what is done so far in noncommutative geometry and import many\nideas from modern algebraic geometry to noncommutative geometry. To achieve\nthis, as a first step, good analogues of \u00e9tale cohomology, the category of motives,\nand correspondences in noncommutative geometry must be introduced. Happily it\nturns out that Connes' category of cyclic modules and the closely related bivariant\ncyclic homology, as well as KK-theory, are quite useful in this regard.\nThe construction of the Frobenius in characteristic zero follows a very general\nprocess that combines cyclic homology with quantum statistical mechanics in a\nnovel way. Starting from a pair (A, \u03c6) of an algebra and a state \u03c6 (a noncommutative space endowed with a 'probability measure'), they proceed by invoking the\ncanonical one-parameter group of automorphisms \u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c6 and consider the extremal\n\n\f16\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nequilibrium states \u03a3\u03b2 at inverse temperatures \u03b2 > 1. Under suitable conditions,\nthere is an algebra map\n\u03c1 : A \u22ca\u03c3 R \u2192 S(\u03a3\u03b2 \u00d7 R\u2217+ ) \u2297 L,\n\nwhere L denotes the algebra of trace class operators. The cyclic module D(A, \u03c6) is\ndefined as the cokernel of the induced map by Tr \u25e6 \u03c1 on the cyclic modules of these\ntwo algebras. The dual multiplicative group R\u2217+ acts on D(A, \u03c6) and, in examples\ncoming from number theory, replaces Frobenius in characteristic zero. The three\nsteps involved in the construction of D(A, \u03c6) are called cooling, distillation, and\ndual action in the paper.\nA remarkable property of the cyclic category \u039b, not shared by the simplicial\ncategory, is its self-duality in the sense that there is a natural isomorphism of\ncategories \u039b \u2243 \u039bop [7]. Roughly speaking, the duality functor \u039bop \u2212\u2192 \u039b acts as the\nidentity on objects of \u039b and exchanges face and degeneracy operators while sending\nthe cyclic operator to its inverse. Thus to a cyclic (resp. cocyclic) module one can\nassociate a cocyclic (resp. cyclic) module by applying the duality isomorphism.\nThis duality plays an important role in Hopf cyclic cohomology.\n5. The local index formula and beyond\nIn practice, computing Connes-Chern characters defined by formulas like (22)\nis rather difficult since they involve the ordinary operator trace and are non-local.\nThus one needs to compute the class of this cyclic cocycle by a local formula. This is\nrather similar to passing from the McKean-Singer formula for the index of an elliptic operator to a local cohomological formula involving integrating a locally defined\ndifferential form, i.e., the Atiyah-Singer index formula. The solution of this problem\nwas arrived at in two stages. First, in [13], Connes gave a partial answer by giving\na local formula for the Hochschild class of the Chern character, and then Connes\nand Moscovici gave a formula that captures the full cyclic cohomology class of the\ncharacter by a local formula [19]. Broadly speaking, the ideas involved amount to\ngoing from noncommutative differential topology to noncommutative spectral geometry, and need the introduction of two new concepts.\nIn the first place, a noncommutative analogue of integration was found by\nConnes by replacing the operator trace by the Dixmier trace [11], and, secondly,\none refines the topological notion of Fredholm module by the metric notion of a\nspectral triple, or K-cycles as they were originally named in [13]. Developing the\nnecessary tools to handle this local index formula, shaped, more or less, the second\nstage of the development of noncommutative geometry after the appearance of the\nlandmark papers [9]. One can say that while in its first stage noncommutative\ngeometry was influenced by differential and algebraic topology, especially index\ntheory, the Novikov conjecture and the Baum-Connes conjecture, in this second\nstage it was chiefly informed by spectral geometry.\nWe start with a quick review of the Dixmier trace and the noncommutative\nintegral, following [13] closely. For a compact operator T , let \u03bcn (T ), n = 1, 2, . . . ,\n1\ndenote the sequence of eigenvalues of |T | = (T \u2217 T ) 2 written in decreasing order.\nThus, by the minimax principle, \u03bc1 (T ) = ||T ||, and in general\n\u03bcn (T ) = inf ||T |V ||,\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\nwhere the infimum is over the set of subspaces of codimension n \u2212 1, and T |V\ndenotes the restriction of T to the subspace V . The natural domain of the Dixmier\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n17\n\ntrace is the set of operators\nL1,\u221e (H) := {T \u2208 K(H);\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bcn (T ) = O (logN )}.\n\n1\n\nNotice that trace class operators are automatically in L1,\u221e (H). The Dixmier trace\nof an operator T \u2208 L1,\u221e (H) measures the logarithmic divergence of its ordinary\ntrace. More precisely, we are interested in taking some kind of limit of the bounded\nsequence\nPN\n\u03bcn (T )\n\u03c3N (T ) = 1\nlogN\nas N \u2192 \u221e. The problem of course is that, while by our assumption the sequence is\nbounded, the usual limit may not exists and must be replaced by a carefully chosen\n'generalized limit'.\nTo this end, let Trace\u039b (T ), \u039b \u2208 [1, \u221e), be the piecewise affine interpolation of\nP\n\u2217\nthe partial trace function TraceN (T ) = N\n1 \u03bcn (T ). Recall that a state on a C algebra is a non-zero positive linear functional on the algebra. Let \u03c9 : Cb [e, \u221e) \u2192 C\nbe a normalized state on the algebra of bounded continuous functions on [e, \u221e) such\nthat \u03c9(f ) = 0 for all f vanishing at \u221e. Now, using \u03c9, the Dixmier trace of a positive\noperator T \u2208 L1,\u221e (H) is defined as\nTr\u03c9 (T ) := \u03c9(\u03c4\u039b (T )),\n\nwhere\n\u03c4\u039b (T ) =\n\n1\nlog \u039b\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\n\ne\nTracer (T )\nlogr\n\nTracer (T ) dr\nlog r\nr\n\nover the multiplicative group R\u2217+ . One\nis the Ces\u00e0ro mean of the function\n1,\u221e\nthen extends Tr\u03c9 to all of L (H) by linearity.\nThe resulting linear functional Tr\u03c9 is a positive trace on L(1,\u221e) (H). It is easy\nto see from its definition that if T actually happens to be a trace class operator\nthen Tr\u03c9 (T ) = 0 for all \u03c9, i.e., the Dixmier trace is invariant under perturbations\nby trace class operators. This is a very useful property and makes Tr\u03c9 a flexible\ntool in computations. The Dixmier trace, Tr\u03c9 , in general depends on the limiting\nprocedure \u03c9; however, for the class of operators T for which Lim\u039b\u2192\u221e \u03c4\u039b (T ) exit,\nit is independent of the choice of \u03c9 and is equal to Lim\u039b\u2192\u221e \u03c4\u039b (T ). One of the\nmain results proved in [11] is that if M is a closed n-dimensional manifold, E is a\nsmooth vector bundle on M , P is a pseudodifferential operator of order \u2212n acting\nbetween L2 -sections of E, and H = L2 (M, E), then P \u2208 L(1,\u221e) (H) and, for any\nchoice of \u03c9, Tr\u03c9 (P ) = n\u22121 Res(P ). Here Res denotes Wodzicki's noncommutative\nresidue. For example, if D is an elliptic first order differential operator, |D|\u2212n is\na pseudodifferential operator of order \u2212n and, for any bounded operator a, the\nDixmier trace Tr\u03c9 (a|D|\u2212n ) is independent of the choice of \u03c9.\nThe second ingredient of the local index formula is the notion of spectral triple\n[13]. Spectral triples provide a refinement of Fredholm modules. Going from Fredholm modules to spectral triples is similar to going from the conformal class of a\nRiemannian metric to the metric itself. Spectral triples simultaneously provide a\nnotion of Dirac operator in noncommutative geometry, as well as a Riemannian\ntype distance function for noncommutative spaces.\nTo motivate the definition of a spectral triple, we recall that the Dirac operator D\n/ on a compact Riemannian Spinc manifold acts as an unbounded selfadjoint\n\n\f18\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\noperator on the Hilbert space L2 (M, S) of L2 -spinors on the manifold M . If we let\nC \u221e (M ) act on L2 (M, S) by multiplication operators, then one can check that for\nany smooth function f , the commutator [D, f ] = Df \u2212 f D extends to a bounded\noperator on L2 (M, S). Now the geodesic distance d on M can be recovered from\nthe following beautiful distance formula of Connes [13]:\nd(p, q) = Sup{|f (p) \u2212 f (q)|; k [D, f ] k\u2264 1},\n\n\u2200p, q \u2208 M.\n\nThe triple (C \u221e (M ), L2 (M, S), D\n/) is a commutative example of a spectral triple. Its\ngeneral definition, in the odd case, is as follows. This definition should be compared\nwith Definition (3.1).\nDefinition 5.1. Let A be a unital algebra. An odd spectral triple on A is a triple\n(A, H, D) consisting of a Hilbert space H, a selfadjoint unbounded operator D :\nDom(D) \u2282 H \u2192 H with compact resolvent, i.e., (D + \u03bb)\u22121 \u2208 K(H), for all \u03bb \u2208\n/ R,\nand a representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 L(H) of A such that for all a \u2208 A, the commutator\n[D, \u03c0(a)] is defined on Dom(D) and extends to a bounded operator on H.\nThe finite summability assumption (21) for Fredholm modules has a finer analogue for spectral triples. For simplicity we shall assume that D is invertible (in\ngeneral, since Ker D is finite dimensional, by restricting to its orthogonal complement we can always reduce to this case). A spectral triple is called finitely summable\nif for some n \u2265 1\n(29)\n\n|D|\u2212n \u2208 L1, \u221e (H).\n\nA simple example of an odd spectral triple is (C \u221e (S 1 ), L2 (S 1 ), D), where D\nd\n. Eigenvalues of |D| are\nis the unique selfadjoint extension of the operator \u2212i dx\n|n|, n \u2208 Z, which shows that, if we restrict D to the orthogonal complement of\nconstant functions, then |D|\u22121 \u2208 L1, \u221e (L2 (S 1 )).\nGiven a spectral triple (A, H, D), one obtains a Fredholm module (A, H, F ) by\nchoosing F = Sign (D) = D|D|\u22121 . Connes' Hochschild character formula gives a\nlocal expression for the Hochschild class of the Connes-Chern character of (A, H, F )\nin terms of D itself. For this one has to assume that the spectral triple (A, H, D)\nis regular in the sense that for all a \u2208 A,\na and [D, a] \u2208 \u2229 Dom(\u03b4 k )\n\nwhere the derivation \u03b4 is given by \u03b4(x) = [|D|, x].\nNow, assuming (29) holds, Connes defines an (n + 1)\u2212linear functional \u03c6 on A\nby\n\u03c6(a0 , a1 , . . . , an ) = Tr\u03c9 (a0 [D, a1 ] * * * [D, an ]|D|\u2212n ).\n\nIt can be shown that \u03c6 is a Hochschild n-cocycle\non A. We recall that a Hochschild\nP 0\nn-cycle c \u2208 Zn (A, A) is an element c =\na \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an \u2208 A\u2297(n+1) such that\nits Hochschild boundary b(c) = 0, where b is defined by (18). The following result,\nknown as Connes' Hochschild character formula, computes the Hochschild class of\nthe Chern charcater by a local formula, i.e., in terms of \u03c6:\nTheorem 5.1. Let (A, H, D) be a regular spectral triple. Let F = Sign (D) denote\nthe sign of D and \u03c4n \u2208 HC n (A) denote thePConnes-Chern charcater of (H, F ). For\nevery n-dimensional Hochschild cycle c = a0 \u2297 a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an \u2208 Zn (A, A), one has\nX\nh\u03c4n , ci =\n\u03c6(a0 , a1 , . . . , an ).\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n19\n\nIdentifying the full cyclic cohomology class of the Connes-Chern character of\n(A, H, D) by a local formula is the content of Connes-Moscovici's local index formula. For this we have to assume the spectral triple satisfies another technical\ncondition. Let B denote the subalgebra of L(H) generated by operators \u03b4 k (a) and\n\u03b4 k ([D, a]), k \u2265 1. A spectral triple is said to have a discrete dimension spectrum \u03a3\nif \u03a3 \u2282 C is discrete and for any b \u2208 B the function\n\u03b6b (z) = Trace(b|D|\u2212z ),\n\nRe z > n,\n\nextends to a holomorphic function on C \\ \u03a3. It is further assumed that \u03a3 is simple\nin the sense that \u03b6b (z) has only simple poles in \u03a3.\nThe local index formula of Connes and Moscovici [19] is given by the following\nTheorem (we have used the formulation in [15]):\nTheorem 5.2. 1. The equality\nZ\n\u2212P = Resz=0 Trace(P |D|\u2212z )\ndefines a trace on the algebra generated by A, [D, A], and |D|z , z \u2208 C.\n2. There are only a finite number of non-zero terms in the following formula which\ndefines the odd components (\u03c6n )n=1,3,... of an odd cyclic cocycle in the (b, B) bicomplex of A: For each odd integer n let\nZ\nX\n0\nn\n\u03c6n (a , . . . , a ) :=\ncn,k \u2212a0 [D, a1 ](k1 ) * * * [D, an ](kn ) |D|\u2212n\u22122|k|\nk\n\nwhere T\nand\n\n(k)\n\nk\n\n:= \u2207 and \u2207(T ) = D2 T \u2212 T D2 , k is a multi-index, |k| = k1 + * * * + kn\n\n\u221a\nn\ncn,k := (\u22121)|k| 2i(k1 ! * * * kn !)\u22121 ((k1 + 1) * * * (k1 + k2 + * * * kn ))\u22121 \u0393(|k| + ).\n2\n3. The pairing of the cyclic cohomology class (\u03c6n ) \u2208 HC \u2217 (A) with K1 (A) gives the\nFredholm index of D with coefficients in K1 (A).\nAs is indicated in part 1) of the above Theorem, a regular spectral tripleR necessarily defines a trace on its underlying algebra by the formula a \u2208 A 7\u2192 \u2212a =\nResz=0 Trace(a|D|\u2212z ). Thus, to deal with 'type III algebras' which carry no nontrivial traces, the notion of spectral triple must be modified. In [25] Connes and\nMoscovici define a notion of twisted spectral triple, where the twist is afforded by\nan algebra automorphism (related to the modular automorphism group). More\nprecisely, one postulates that there exists an automorphism \u03c3 of A such that the\ntwisted commutators\n[D, a]\u03c3 := Da \u2212 \u03c3(a)D\nare bounded operators for all a \u2208 A. They show that, in the twisted case, the\nDixmier trace induces a twisted trace on the algebra A, but surprisingly, under\nsome regularity conditions, the Connes-Chern character of the phase space lands\nin ordinary cyclic cohomology. Thus its pairing with ordinary K-theory makes\nsense, and it can be recovered as the index of Fredholm operators. This suggests\nthe significance of developing a local index formula for twisted spectral triples, i.e.\nfinding a formula for a cocycle, cohomologous to the Connes-Chern character in\nthe (b, B)-bicomplex, which is given in terms of twisted commutators and residue\nfunctionals. I beleive that this new theme of twisted spectral triples, and type III\nnoncommutative geometry in general, will dominate the subject in near future.\n\n\f20\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nFor example, very recently a local index formula has been proved for a class of\ntwisted spectral triples by Henri Moscovici [34] that can be found in the present\nvolume. This class is obtained by twisting an ordinary spectral triple (A, H, D)\nby a subgroup G of conformal similarities of the triple, i.e. the set of all unitary\noperators U \u2208 U(H) such that U AU \u2217 = A, and U DU \u2217 = \u03bc(U )D, with \u03bc(U ) > 0.\nIt is shown that the crossed product algebra A \u22ca G admits an automorphism \u03c3,\ngiven by the formula \u03c3(aU ) = \u03bc(U )\u22121 aU , for all a \u2208 A, U \u2208 G, and (A \u22ca G, H, D)\nis a twisted spectral triple. The analogue of the noncommutative residue on the\ncircle, for algebras of formal twisted pseudodifferential symbols, is constructed in\n[27].\nA very recent development related to (twisted) spectral triples is the noncommutative Gauss-Bonnet theorem of Connes and Tretkoff for the noncommutative\ntwo-torus A\u03b8 [26]. In classical geometry a spectral zeta function is associated to the\nLaplacian \u2206g = d\u2217 d of a Riemann surface with metric g:\nX\n\u03bb\u2212s\n\u03b6(s) =\nj , Re(s) > 1,\nj\n\nwhere the \u03bbj ' s are the nonzero eigenvalues of \u2206g . This zeta function has a meromorphic continuation with no pole at 0, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces\ncan be expressed as\nZ\n1\n1\nR = \u03c7(\u03a3),\n\u03b6(0) + Card{j|\u03bbj = 0} =\n12\u03c0 \u03a3\n6\nwhere R is the curvature and \u03c7(\u03a3) is the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 characteristic.\nIt is this formulation of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in spectral terms that admits\na generalization to noncommutative geometry. Let A\u03b8 denote the C \u2217 -algebra of the\nnoncommutative torus with parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R \\ Q and let \u03c4 : A\u03b8 \u2192 C denote its\nfaithful normalized trace. One can define an inner product\nha, bi = \u03c4 (b\u2217 a), a, b \u2208 A\u03b8 ,\nand complete A\u03b8 with respect to this inner product to obtain a Hilbert space H0 .\nMore generally, for any smooth selfadjoint element h = h\u2217 \u2208 A\u03b8 one defines an\ninner product ha, bi\u03c6 = \u03c4 (b\u2217 ae\u2212h ), where the positive linear functional \u03c6 = \u03c6h is\ndefined by\n\u03c6(a) = \u03c4 (ae\u2212h ), a \u2208 A\u03b8 .\n\nLet H\u03c6 denote the completion of A\u03b8 with respect to this conformally equivalent\nmetric.\nUsing the canonical derivations \u03b41 and \u03b42 of A\u03b8 , one can introduce a complex\nstructure on A\u03b8 by defining\n\u2202 = \u03b41 + i\u03b42 , \u2202 \u2217 = \u03b41 \u2212 i\u03b42 .\n\nThese operators can be considered as unbounded operators on H0 and \u2202 \u2217 is the\nadjoint of \u2202. Then the unperturbed Laplacian on A\u03b8 is given by\n\u2206 = \u2202 \u2217 \u2202 = \u03b412 + \u03b422 .\nIn general we can consider the unbounded operator \u2202 = \u03b41 + i\u03b42 : H\u03c6 \u2192 H(1,0) ,\nwhere H(1,0) is the completion of the linear span of elements of the form a\u2202b with\n\u2217\na, b \u2208 A\u221e\n\u03b8 . Let \u2202\u03c6 denote its adjoint. Then the Laplacian for the conformally\nequivalent metric ha, bi\u03c6 is given by \u2206\u2032 = \u2202\u03c6\u2217 \u2202.\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n21\n\nIn [26], Connes and Tretkoff show that the value at 0 of the zeta function\nassociated to this Laplacian \u2206\u2032 is an invariant of the conformal class of the metric\non A\u03b8 , i.e. of h. A natural problem here is to extend this result by considering\nthe most general complex structure on A\u03b8 of the form \u2202 = \u03b41 + \u03c4 \u03b42 , where \u03c4 is a\ncomplex number with Im(\u03c4 ) > 0. This problem is now solved in full generality in\n[28].\n6. Hopf cyclic cohomology\nA major development in cyclic cohomology theory in the last ten years was the\nintroduction of Hopf cyclic cohomology for Hopf algebras by Connes and Moscovici\n[20]. As we saw in Section 5, the local index formula gives the Connes-Chern\ncharacter of a regular spectral triple (A, H, D) as a cyclic cocycle in the (b, B)bicomplex of the algebra A. For spectral triples of interest in transverse geometry\n[20], this cocycle is differentiable in the sense that it is in the image of the ConnesMoscovici characteristic map \u03c7\u03c4 defined below (31), with H = H1 a Hopf algebra\nand A = A\u0393 , a noncommutative algebra, whose definitions we shall recall in this\nsection. To identify this cyclic cocycle in terms of characteristic classes of foliations,\nthey realized that it would be extremely helpful to show that it is the image of a\npolynomial in some universal cocycles for a cohomology theory for a universal Hopf\nalgebra, and this gave birth to Hopf cyclic cohomology and to the universal Hopf\nalgebra H = H1 . This is similar to the situation for classical characteristic classes\nof manifolds, which are pullbacks of group cohomology classes.\nThe Connes-Moscovici characteristic map can be formulated in general terms\nas follows. Let H be a Hopf algebra acting as quantum symmetries of an algebra\nA, i.e., A is a left H-module, and the algebra structure of A is compatible with the\ncoalgebra structure of H in the sense that the multiplication A \u00d7 A \u2192 A and the\nunit map C \u2192 A of A are morphisms of H-modules. A common terminology to\ndescribe this situation is to say that A is a left H-module algebra. Using Sweedler's\nnotation for the coproduct of H, \u2206(h) = h(1) \u2297 h(2) (summation is understood),\nthis latter compatibility condition can be expressed as\nh(ab) = h(1) (a)h(2) (b),\n\nand h(1) = \u03b5(h)1,\n\nfor all h \u2208 H and a, b \u2208 A. In general one should think of such actions of Hopf\nalgebras as the noncommutative geometry analogue of the action of differential\noperators on a manifold.\nIt is also important to extend the notion of trace to allow twisted traces, such\nas KMS states in quantum statistical mechanics, as well as the idea of invariance\nof a (twisted) trace. The general setting introduced in [20] is the following. Let\n\u03b4 : H \u2192 C be a character of H, i.e. a unital algebra map, and \u03c3 \u2208 H be a grouplike\nelement, i.e. it satisfies \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2297 \u03c3. A linear map \u03c4 : A \u2192 C is called \u03b4-invariant\nif for all h \u2208 H and a \u2208 A,\n\u03c4 (h(a)) = \u03b4(h)\u03c4 (a),\nand is called a \u03c3-trace if for all a, b in A,\n\u03c4 (ab) = \u03c4 (b\u03c3(a)).\nNow for a, b \u2208 A, let\n\nha, bi := \u03c4 (ab).\n\n\f22\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nLet \u03c4 be a \u03c3-trace on A. Then \u03c4 is \u03b4-invariant if and only if the integration by parts\nformula holds. That is, for all h \u2208 H and a, b \u2208 A,\nhh(a), bi = ha, Se\u03b4 (h)(b)i.\n\n(30)\n\nHere S denotes the antipode of H and the \u03b4-twisted antipode Se\u03b4 : H \u2192 H is defined\nby Se\u03b4 = \u03b4 \u2217 S, i.e.\nSe\u03b4 (h) = \u03b4(h(1) )S(h(2) ),\n\nfor all h \u2208 H. Loosely speaking, (30) says that the formal adjoint of the differential\noperator h is Se\u03b4 (h). Following [20, 21], we say that (\u03b4, \u03c3) is a modular pair if\n\u03b4(\u03c3) = 1, and a modular pair in involution if in addition we have\nSe\u03b42 (h) = \u03c3h\u03c3 \u22121 ,\n\nfor all h in H. The importance of this notion will become clear in the next paragraph.\nNow, for each n \u2265 0, the Connes-Moscovici characteristic map\n\u03c7\u03c4 : H \u2297n \u2212\u2192 C n (A),\n\n(31)\nis defined by\n\n\u03c7\u03c4 (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn )(a0 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an ) = \u03c4 (a0 h1 (a1 ) * * * hn (an )).\nNotice that the right hand side of (31) is the cocyclic module that (its cohomology)\ndefines the cyclic cohomology of the algebra A. The main question about (31) is\nwhether one can promote the collection of linear spaces {H \u2297n }n\u22650 to a cocyclic\nmodule such that the characteristic map \u03c7\u03c4 turns into a morphism of cocyclic\nmodules. We recall that the face, degeneracy, and cyclic operators for {C n (A)}n\u22650\nare defined by:\n\u03b4i \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an+1 ) =\n\u03b4n+1 \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an+1 ) =\n\u03c3i \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an ) =\n\u03c4n \u03c6(a0 , . . . , an ) =\n\n\u03c6(a0 , . . . , ai ai+1 , . . . , an+1 ),\n\u03c6(an+1 a0 , a1 , . . . , an ),\n\u03c6(a0 , . . . , ai , 1, . . . , an ),\n\ni = 0, . . . , n,\n\ni = 0, . . . , n,\n\n\u03c6(an , a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ).\n\nThe relation h(ab) = h(1) (a)h(2) (b) shows that, in order for \u03c7\u03c4 to be compatible\nwith face operators, the face operators \u03b4i on H \u2297n , at least for 0 \u2264 i < n, must\ninvolve the coproduct of H. In fact if we define, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03b4in : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297(n+1) ,\nby\n\u03b40 (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) =\n\n\u03b4i (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) =\n\u03b4n+1 (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) =\n\n1 \u2297 h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ,\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nh1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hi \u2297 hi\nh1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn \u2297 \u03c3,\n\n\u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ,\n\nthen we have, for all i = 0, 1, . . . , n\n\u03c7\u03c4 \u03b4i = \u03b4i \u03c7\u03c4 .\nNotice that the last relation is a consequence of the \u03c3-trace property of \u03c4 . Similarly,\nthe relation h(1A ) = \u03b5(h)1A shows that the degeneracy operators on H \u2297n should\ninvolve the counit of H. We thus define\n\u03c3i (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) = h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03b5(hi ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn .\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n23\n\nIt is very hard, on the other hand, to come up with a correct formula for the\ncyclic operator \u03c4n : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297n . Compatibility with \u03c7\u03c4 demands that\n\u03c4 (a0 \u03c4n (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn )(a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an )) = \u03c4 (an h1 (a0 )h2 (a1 ) * * * hn (an\u22121 )),\n\nfor all ai 's and hi 's. For n = 1, the integration by parts formula (30), combined\nwith the \u03c3-trace property of \u03c4 , shows that\n\u03c4 (a1 h(a0 )) = \u03c4 (h(a0 )\u03c3(a1 )) = \u03c4 (a0 S\u0303\u03b4 (h)\u03c3(a1 )).\nThis suggests that we should define \u03c41 : H \u2192 H by\n\u03c41 (h) = S\u0303\u03b4 (h)\u03c3.\n\nNote that the required cyclicity condition for \u03c41 , \u03c412 = 1, is equivalent to the involution condition Se\u03b42 (h) = \u03c3h\u03c3 \u22121 for the pair (\u03b4, \u03c3). This line of reasoning can be\nextended to all n \u2265 0 and gives us:\n\u03c4 (an h1 (a0 ) * * * hn (an\u22121 ))\n\n= \u03c4 (h1 (a0 ) * * * hn (an\u22121 )\u03c3(an ))\n\n= \u03c4 (a0 S\u0303\u03b4 (h1 )(h2 (a1 ) * * * hn (an\u22121 )\u03c3(an )))\n\n= \u03c4 (a0 S\u0303\u03b4 (h1 ) * (h2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn \u2297 \u03c3)(a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 an )).\n\nThis suggests that the Hopf-cyclic operator \u03c4n : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297n should be defined as\n\u03c4n (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) = S\u0303\u03b4 (h1 ) * (h2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn \u2297 \u03c3),\n\nwhere * denotes the diagonal action defined by\n\nh * (h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ) := h(1) h1 \u2297 h(2) h2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 h(n) hn .\n\nThe remarkable fact, proved by Connes and Moscovici [20, 21], is that endowed\nwith the above face, degeneracy, and cyclic operators, {H \u2297n }n\u22650 is a cocyclic\nmodule. The proof is a very clever and complicated tour de force of Hopf algebra\nidentities.\nThe resulting cyclic cohomology groups, which depend on the choice of a modn\nular pair in involution (\u03b4, \u03c3), are denoted by HC(\u03b4,\u03c3)\n(H), n = 0, 1, . . . . The characteristic map (31) clearly induces a map between corresponding cyclic cohomology\ngroups\nn\n(H) \u2192 HC n (A).\n\u03c7\u03c4 : HC(\u03b4,\u03c3)\n\nUnder this map Hopf cyclic cocycles are mapped to cyclic cocycles on A. Very many\nof the interesting cyclic cocycles in noncommutative geometry are obtained in this\nfashion. Using the above discussed cocyclic module structure of {H \u2297n }n\u22650 , we see\nthat a Hopf cyclic n-cocycle is an element x \u2208 H \u2297n which satisfies the relations\nbx = 0,\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)x = 0,\n\nwhere b : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297(n+1) and \u03bb : H \u2297n \u2192 H \u2297n are defined by\nb(h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn )\n\n= 1 \u2297 h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn\nn\nX\n(2)\n(1)\n(\u22121)i h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hi \u2297 hi \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn\n+\ni=1\n\n\u03bb(h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn )\n\n+ (\u22121)n+1 h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn \u2297 \u03c3,\n\n= (\u22121)n S\u0303\u03b4 (h1 ) * (h2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn \u2297 \u03c3).\n\nThe characteristic map (31) has its origins in Connes' earlier work on noncommutative differential geometry [4], and on his work on the transverse fundamental\n\n\f24\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nclass of foliations [8]. In fact in these papers some interesting cyclic cocycles were\ndefined in the context of actions of Lie algebras and (Lie) groups. Both examples\ncan be shown to be special cases of the characteristic map. For example let A = A\u03b8\ndenote the smooth algebra of coordinates for the noncommutative torus with parameter \u03b8 \u2208 R. The abelian Lie algebra R2 acts on A\u03b8 via canonical derivations\n\u03b41 and \u03b42 . The standard trace \u03c4 on A\u03b8 is invariant under the action of R2 , i.e.,\nwe have \u03c4 (\u03b41 (a)) = \u03c4 (\u03b42 (a)) = 0 for all a \u2208 A\u03b8 . Then one can directly check that\nunder the characteristic map (31) the two dimensional generator of the Lie algebra\nhomology of R2 is mapped to the following cyclic 2-cocycle on A\u03b8 first defined in\n[4]:\n1\n\u03c6(a0 , a1 , a2 ) =\n\u03c4 (a0 (\u03b41 (a1 )\u03b42 (a2 ) \u2212 \u03b42 (a1 )\u03b41 (a2 ))).\n2\u03c0i\nFor a second example let G be a discrete group and c be a normalized group ncocycle on G with trivial coefficients. Here by normalized we mean c(g1 , . . . , gn ) = 0\nif gi = e for some i. Then one checks that the following is a cyclic n-cocycle on the\ngroup algebra CG [8]:\n\u001a\nc(g1 , g2 . . . , gn ) if g0 g1 . . . gn = 1\n\u03c6(g0 , g1 . . . , gn ) =\n0\notherwise\nAfter an appropriate dual version of Hopf cyclic cohomology is defined, one can\nshow that this cyclic cocycle can also be defined via (31).\nThe most sophisticated example of the characteristic map (31), so far, involves\nthe Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra H1 and its action on algebras of interest in\ntransverse geometry. In fact, as we shall see, H1 acts as quantum symmetries of\nvarious objects of interest in noncommutative geometry, like the frame bundle of\nthe 'space' of leaves of codimension one foliations or the 'space' of modular forms\nmodulo the action of Hecke correspondences.\nTo describe H1 , let gaf f denote the Lie algebra of the group of affine transformations of the line with linear basis X and Y and the relation [Y, X] = X. Let g\nbe an abelian Lie algebra with basis {\u03b4n ; n = 1, 2, . . . }. Its universal enveloping\nalgebra U (g) should be regarded as the continuous dual of the pro-unipotent group\nof orientation preserving diffeomorphisms \u03c6 of R with \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6\u2032 (0) = 1. It\nis easily seen that gaf f acts on g via\n[Y, \u03b4n ] = n\u03b4n ,\n\n[X, \u03b4n ] = \u03b4n+1 ,\n\nfor all n. Let gCM := gaf f \u22ca g be the corresponding semidirect product Lie algebra.\nAs an algebra, H1 coincides with the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra\ngCM . Thus H1 is the universal algebra generated by {X, Y, \u03b4n ; n = 1, 2, . . . } subject\nto the relations\n[Y, X] = X, [Y, \u03b4n ] = n\u03b4n , [X, \u03b4n ] = \u03b4n+1 , [\u03b4k , \u03b4l ] = 0,\nfor n, k, l = 1, 2, . . . . We let the counit of H1 coincide with the counit of U (gCM ).\nIts coproduct and antipode, however, will be certain deformations of the coproduct\nand antipode of U (gCM ) as follows. Using the universal property of U (gCM ), one\nchecks that the relations\n\u2206Y = Y \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Y,\n\n\u2206\u03b41 = \u03b41 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u03b41 ,\n\n\u2206X = X \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 X + \u03b41 \u2297 Y,\ndetermine a unique algebra map \u2206 : H1 \u2192 H1 \u2297H1 . Note that \u2206 is not cocommutative and it differs from the coproduct of the enveloping algebra U (gCM ). Similarly,\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n25\n\none checks that there is a unique antialgebra map, the antipode, S : H1 \u2192 H1\ndetermined by the relations\nS(Y ) = \u2212Y, S(X) = \u2212X + \u03b41 Y, S(\u03b41 ) = \u2212\u03b41 .\n\nThe first realization of H1 was through its action as quantum symmetries of\nthe 'frame bundle' of the noncommutative space of leaves of codimension one foliations. More precisely, given a codimension one foliation (V, F ), let M be a smooth\ntransversal for (V, F ). Let A = C0\u221e (F + M ) denote the algebra of smooth functions\nwith compact support on the bundle of positively oriented frames on M and let\n\u0393 \u2282 Dif f + (M ) denote the holonomy group of (V, F ). One has a natural prolongation of the action of \u0393 to F + (M ) by\n\u03c6(y, y1 ) = (\u03c6(y), \u03c6\u2032 (y)(y1 )).\nLet A\u0393 = C0\u221e (F + M ) \u22ca \u0393 denote the corresponding crossed product algebra. Thus\nthe elements of A\u0393 consist of finite linear combinations (over C) of terms f U\u03c6\u2217 with\nf \u2208 C0\u221e (F + M ) and \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393. Its product is defined by\n\u2217\n.\nf U\u03c6\u2217 * gU\u03c8\u2217 = (f * \u03c6(g))U\u03c8\u03c6\n\nThere is an action of H1 on A\u0393 , given by [20, 23]:\n\u2202f\n\u2202f \u2217\nU , X(f U\u03c6\u2217 ) = y1 U\u03c6\u2217 ,\nY (f U\u03c6\u2217 ) = y1\n\u2202y1 \u03c6\n\u2202y\nn\nd\u03c6\nd\n\u03b4n (f U\u03c6\u2217 ) = y1n n (log )f U\u03c6\u2217 .\ndy\ndy\nOnce these formulas are given, it can be checked, by a long computation, that A\u0393\nis indeed an H1 -module algebra. To define the corresponding characteristic map,\nConnes and Moscovici defined a modular pair in involution (\u03b4, 1) on H1 and a\n\u03b4-invariant trace on A\u0393 as we shall describe next.\nLet \u03b4 denote the unique extension of the modular character\n\u03b4 : gaf f \u2192 R,\n\n\u03b4(X) = 1, \u03b4(Y ) = 0,\n\nto a character \u03b4 : U (gaf f ) \u2192 C. There is a unique extension of \u03b4 to a character,\ndenoted by the same symbol \u03b4 : H1 \u2192 C. Indeed, the relations [Y, \u03b4n ] = n\u03b4n\nshow that we must have \u03b4(\u03b4n ) = 0, for n = 1, 2, . . . . One can then check that\nthese relations are compatible with the algebra structure of H1 . The algebra A\u0393 =\nC0\u221e (F + (M ) \u22ca \u0393 admits a \u03b4-invariant trace \u03c4 : A\u0393 \u2192 C given by [20]:\nZ\ndydy1\n\u2217\nf (y, y1 ) 2 , if \u03c6 = 1,\n\u03c4 (f U\u03c6 ) =\ny1\n+\nF (M)\nand \u03c4 (f U\u03c6\u2217 ) = 0, otherwise. Now, using the \u03b4-invariant trace \u03c4 and the above\ndefined action H1 \u2297 A\u0393 \u2192 A\u0393 , the characteristic map (31) takes the form\n\u2217\n\u03c7\u03c4 : HC(\u03b4,1)\n(H1 ) \u2212\u2192 HC \u2217 (A\u0393 ).\n\nThis map plays a fundamental role in transverse index theory in [20].\nThe Hopf algebra H1 shows its beautiful head in number theory as well. To give\nan indication of this, I shall briefly discuss the modular Hecke algebras and actions\nof H1 on them as they were introduced by Connes and Moscovici in [23, 24].

Let Mk (\u0393(N )) denote\nthe space of modular forms of level N and weight k and\nM\nM(\u0393(N )) :=\nMk (\u0393(N ))\nk\n\nbe the graded algebra of modular forms of level N . Finally, let\nM := lim M(\u0393(N ))\n\u2192\nN\n\ndenote the algebra of modular forms of all levels, where the inductive system is\ndefined by divisibility. The group\nG+ (Q) := GL+ (2, Q),\nacts on M through its usual action on functions on the upper half-plane (with\ncorresponding weight):\n(f, \u03b1) 7\u2192 f |k \u03b1(z) = det(\u03b1)k/2 (cz + d)\u2212k f (\u03b1 * z),\n\u0012\n\u0013\naz + b\na b\n\u03b1=\n, \u03b1*z =\n.\nc d\ncz + d\nThe simplest modular Hecke algebra is the crossed-product algebra\nA = AG+ (Q) := M \u22ca G+ (Q).\n\nP\nElements of this (noncommutative) algebra will be denoted by finite sums\nf U\u03b3\u2217 ,\n+\nf \u2208 M, \u03b3 \u2208 G (Q). A can be thought of as the algebra of noncommutative coordinates on the noncommutative quotient space of modular forms modulo Hecke\ncorrespondences.\nNow consider the operator X of degree two on the space of modular forms\ndefined by\n1 d\n1 d\n\u2212\n(log \u2206) * Y,\nX :=\n2\u03c0i dz\n12\u03c0i dz\nwhere\n\u221e\nY\n\u2206(z) = (2\u03c0)12 \u03b7 24 (z) = (2\u03c0)12 q\n(1 \u2212 q n )24 , q = e2\u03c0iz ,\nn=1\n\n\u03b7 is the Dedekind eta function, and Y is the grading operator\nk\nY (f ) = * f, for all f \u2208 Mk .\n2\nIt is shown in [23] that there is a unique action of H1 on AG+ (Q) determined by\nX(f U\u03b3\u2217 ) = X(f )U\u03b3\u2217 ,\n\nwhere\n\nY (f U\u03b3\u2217 ) = Y (f )U\u03b3\u2217 ,\n\n\u03b41 (f U\u03b3\u2217 ) = \u03bc\u03b3 * f (U\u03b3\u2217 ),\n\n1 d\n\u2206|\u03b3\nlog\n.\n2\u03c0i dz\n\u2206\nThis action is compatible with the algebra structure, i.e., AG+ (Q) is an H1 -module\nalgebra. Thus one can think of H1 as quantum symmetries of the noncommutative\nspace represented by AG+ (Q) .\nMore generally, for any congruence subgroup \u0393, an algebra A(\u0393) is constructed\nin [23] that contains as subalgebras both the algebra of \u0393-modular forms and the\nHecke ring at level \u0393. There is also a corresponding action of H1 on A(\u0393).\n\u03bc\u03b3 (z) =\n\n\fA SHORT SURVEY OF CYCLIC COHOMOLOGY\n\n27\n\nn\nThe Hopf cyclic cohomology groups HC(\u03b4,\u03c3)\n(H) are computed in several cases\nin [20]. Of particular interest for applications to transverse index theory and number theory is the (periodic) cyclic cohomology of H1 . It is shown in [20] that the\nn\nperiodic groups HP(\u03b4,1)\n(H1 ) are canonically isomorphic to the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology, with trivial coefficients, of the Lie algebra a1 of formal vector fields on\nthe line:\nM\n\u2217+2i\n\u2217\n(H1 ) =\nHP(\u03b4,1)\nHGF\n(a1 , C).\ni\u22650\n\nThis result is very significant in that it relates the Gelfand-Fuchs construction of\ncharacteristic classes of smooth manifolds to a noncommutative geometric construction of the same via H1 . Connes and Moscovici also identified certain interesting\nelements in the Hopf cyclic cohomology of H1 . For example, it can be directly\nchecked that the elements \u03b42\u2032 := \u03b42 \u2212 21 \u03b412 and \u03b41 are Hopf cyclic 1-cocycles for H1 ,\nand\nF := X \u2297 Y \u2212 Y \u2297 X \u2212 \u03b41 Y \u2297 Y\n\nis a Hopf cyclic 2-cocycle. Under the characteristic map (31) and for A = A\u0393 these\nHopf cyclic cocycles are mapped to the Schwarzian derivative, the Godbillon-Vey\ncocycle, and the transverse fundamental class of Connes [8], respectively. See [24]\nfor detailed calculations as well as relations with modular forms and modular Hecke\nalgebras. Very recently the unstable cyclic cohomology groups of H1 , and a series\nof other Hopf algebras attached to pseudogroups of geometric structures, were fully\nn\ncomputed in [35, 36]. In particular it is shown that the groups HC(\u03b4,\u03c3)\n(H1 ) are\nfinite dimensional for all n.\nThe notion of modular pair in involution (\u03b4, \u03c3) for a Hopf algebra might seem\nrather ad hoc at a first glance. This is in fact not the case and the concept is\nvery natural and fundamental. For example, it is shown in [21] that coribbon Hopf\nalgebras and compact quantum groups are endowed with canonical modular pairs\nof the form (\u03b4, 1) and, dually, ribbon Hopf algebras have canonical modular pairs of\nthe type (1, \u03c3). The fundamental importance of modular pairs in involution was\nfurther elucidated when Hopf cyclic cohomology with coefficients was introduced in\n[30, 31]. It turns out that some very stringent conditions have to be imposed on an\nH-module M in order for M to serve as a coefficient (local system) for Hopf cyclic\ncohomology theory. Such modules are called stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld modules.\nMore precisely, a (left-left) anti-Yetter-Drinfeld H-module is a left H-module M\nwhich is simultaneously a left H-comodule such that\n\u03c1(hm) = h(1) m(\u22121) S(h(3) ) \u2297 h(2) m(0) ,\n\nfor all h \u2208 H and m \u2208 M. Here \u03c1 : M \u2192 H \u2297 M , \u03c1(m) = m(\u22121) \u2297 m(0) is the\ncomodule structure map of M . M is called stable if in addition we have\nm(\u22121) m(0) = m,\nfor all m \u2208 M . Given a stable anti-Yetter-Drinfeld (SAYD) module M over H,\none can then define the Hopf cyclic cohomology of H with coefficients in M. Onedimensional SAYD modules correspond to Connes-Moscovici's modular pairs in\ninvolution. More precisely, there is a one-to-one correspondence between modular\npairs in involution (\u03b4, \u03c3) on H and SAYD module structures on M = C, the ground\nfield, defined by\nh.r = \u03b4(h)r, r 7\u2192 \u03c3 \u2297 r,\n\n\f28\n\nMASOUD KHALKHALI\n\nfor all h \u2208 H and r \u2208 C. Thus a modular pair in involution can be regarded as an\n'equivariant line bundle' over the noncommutative space represented by the Hopf\nalgebra H.\nReferences\n[1] M. F. Atiyah and I. M.
