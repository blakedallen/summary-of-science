In supersymmetric string theory, there are also unstable D-branes. The stable D-branes carry\ncharges, so a pair of oppositely charged branes at subcritical separation also becomes\nunstable and will decay in a similar manner. Investigations of properties of stable\nD-branes have lead to many important insights, so one may hope that the same will\nbe true for unstable D-branes. The annihilation of an unstable pair of D-branes is a\nbasic process to be understood, and also a building block for many string-based cosmological scenarios. However, D-brane decay is computationally a more demanding\nprocess to study. Many simple questions remain unsolved, and have received little\nattention recently.1 In this paper we investigate the amplitude for the emission of\na pair of closed strings from a decaying brane, in the simple \"half S-brane\" rolling\ntachyon decay background [4, 5]. We focus on Dp-branes with p < 25.\nThe single closed string emission channel is relatively well understood, both in\nbosonic [6\u20138] and superstring [9] theory, also in the presence of background electric\nfields, fluxes, or winding [10\u201313]. Bulk-boundary amplitudes (emission of a closed\nstring from a perturbed D-brane) can also be calculated analytically in bosonic and\nsupersymmetric theories [14\u201316] (see also [17, 18]).\nFor multi-string amplitudes, one strategy to calculate the associated n-point (bulk\nor boundary) amplitudes was based on previous success in bulk Liouville theory [19].\nAlso in boundary Liouville theory, two-point and three-point functions have welldefined analytical expressions [20\u201322]. In [23, 24] it was proposed that analytic continuation in coupling b \u2192 i and field space \u03c6 \u2192 iX 0 to timelike Liouville theory\ncould be used to obtain results in the rolling tachyon background. For bulk-boundary\namplitudes, analytic continuation from spacelike theory lead to a result [15,17] which\nis in agreement to that of [14] which was based on a more straightforward approach.\nClosed string pair production, or associated two-point functions were investigated\nin [23, 24] but the obtained amplitudes did not display the expected pole structure.\nRef. [14] analyzed the problem and identified some potential problems in the analytic continuation. For additional related work, see [25]. We will comment on the\nanalytic properties in more detail in Section 2. For the \"full S-brane\" background,\nan interesting prescription to compute disk n-point amplitudes was proposed in [26],\nand its higher order extensions were investigated in [27]. It would be interesting to\ninvestigate this method further to compare the results with those obtained on the\nhalf S-brane background. Additional work on string scattering from decaying branes\ncan also be found in [28]. See also the reviews on open string tachyon dynamics [29]\n1\n\nExcept for the more ambitious open string field theory program, where notable progress in\ntachyon condensation was obtained in [1, 2] and subsequent work, see [3] for recent discussion in\nrelating the results to boundary conformal theory.\n\n2\n\n\fclosed string\n\nclosed string\n\nt\nbrane\n\nclosed string\n\nclosed string\n\ns\nbrane\n\nFigure 1: Two channels for emission of a pair of closed strings from a decaying brane.\nNote the t \u2194 s difference compared to string scattering, see Fig. 2 of [37].\nand on Liouville field theory [30].\nIn this paper we continue developing the approach initiated in [14], in particular\nwe use the relation of correlation functions in the rolling tachyon background to\nthermal expectation values in a classical log gas of unit charges in two dimensions.\nThe thermal interpretation was further explored in [31\u201336]. We also use the powerful\ncontour integral representation which was developed in [25] to study n-point boundary\nfunctions. Our main result is an amplitude (obtained by working in the high-energy\nlimit) for the emission of a pair of closed string tachyons from the decaying brane.\nThe formula differs from the previously obtained ones by its more promising pole\nstructure. It contains the two expected channels: an s-channel, where an on-shell\nclosed string propagates first before splitting to the two emitted closed strings, and\na t-channel, where a pair of on-shell open strings propagate first before closing off to\nthe pair of closed strings, depicted in Figure 1.\nOur new calculational ingredient is the use of electrostatics to estimate the leading\ncontribution to the correlation function. While electrostatic analogues have a long\nhistory in string theory [38], our approach is reminiscent of that by Gross and Mende\n[39] (see also [40, 41]), who used electrostatic equilibrium conditions to identify the\ndominant saddle point contributions to string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order\nto determine their high energy behavior. We will also be interested in the high energy\nlimit (for the emitted strings), but we consider only the leading disk amplitude, which\nis already complicated due to the rolling tachyon background which will correspond to\n3\n\n\fa thermal charged gas background. In the high energy limit, our amplitude displays\nthe expected exponential \u223c e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9 suppression, with the sum of the energies of the\nemitted strings in the exponent.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief derivation of the\nperturbative series expansion of the bulk two-point amplitude. We then comment\nbriefly on previous work and analytic properties of the series expansion, and convert\nit to an integral representation appealing to [25]. Section 3 presents the electrostatics\napproach and applies it to the emission amplitude calculation. Section 4 introduces\nMandelstam variables and presents the result for the amplitude formula and identifies\nthe poles. We then consider its high energy asymptotics in different kinematic limits\nand find that the amplitude becomes at least exponentially suppressed, as expected.\nIn the end there are three appendices, Appendix A collects some details on kinematics\nand the amplitude calculation, for readers' convenience. Appendix B discusses an\nalternative attempt to obtain an exact result for the two-point amplitude, using a\nSchur polynomial method. Appendix C contains some details of the electrostatics\ncalculations. We also plan to present a more general discussion of the electrostatic\napproximation in a forthcoming work [42].\n\n2\n\nThe bulk two-point amplitude\n\nWe begin with setting up the notations for different correlation functions.

We adopt a notation \u03bea = \u2212i\u03c9a and break up the spatial momentum\nk\nto parallel and perpendicular directions to the unstable Dp-brane: ~ka = (~ka , ~ka\u22a5 ). We\nk\nk\nk\nalso denote ka = (\u03c9a , ~ka ) = (i\u03bea , ~ka ). On-shell conditions for the bosonic closed string\ntachyons are ka2 = \u03bea2 + (~ka )2 = 4. Furthermore, one finds that the overall (spatial)\nparallel momentum is conserved: ~kk1 + ~kk2 = 0.\nThe worldsheet correlation functions can be evaluated by first isolating the zero\nmodes from the oscillators, X \u03bc = x\u03bc + X \u2032\u03bc , and then expanding the boundary defor4\n\n\fmation into a power series.

Let the (imaginary) energy of the closed string vertex at w1 = r be\n\u03be1 \u2261 \u03be and the energy of the string at w2 = 0 be \u03be2 . The first challenge in calculating\nthe amplitude is the integrals (7), which now become\n#\"\n#\nZ \"Y\nN\nY\ndti\n1\nZ2 (r, \u03be; N) =\n(8)\n|r \u2212 eiti |2\u03be\n|eiti \u2212 eitj |2 .\nN!\n2\u03c0\ni=1\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\nWe can make the following general remarks:\n\u2022 For 0 \u2264 r < 1 the integral Z2 (r, \u03be; N) is an analytic function of \u03be.\n\u2022 For negative integer \u03be and for N \u2265 |\u03be| the integral can be evaluated by using\n2\nidentities of the Schur polynomials [24] giving Z2 (r, \u03be; N) = (1 \u2212 r 2 )\u2212\u03be . For\npositive integer \u03be the integral is a polynomial in r, and may be written down\nexplicitly by using Schur polynomials (see Appendix B).\n5\n\n\f2\n\n\u2022 In the limit N \u2192 \u221e authors of [14] also find Z2 (r, \u03be; N) \u2192 (1 \u2212 r 2 )\u2212\u03be .\n\u2022 For r \u2192 1, and if Re \u03be > \u22121/2,2 Z2 (r, \u03be; N) approaches smoothly the boundaryone-point and bulk-boundary functions [14] (see also [15]).\nIn the final amplitude the interesting region is \u03be = \u2212i\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the energy of\nthe closed string at w1 = r. In the case of (integrated) boundary amplitudes, it is\npossible to analytically continue from positive Re \u03be to imaginary values [25]. The bulk\nintegrals approach smoothly the boundary ones for positive Re \u03be in the limit r \u2192 1,\nso it is natural to assume that the Re \u03be > 0 region may be a good starting point to\nstudy the complete bulk amplitudes.\nThere are closely related problems where the scattering amplitude, the sum of N\nover an infinite series of terms, is essentially equal to a generic Nth term after analytP\nically continuing N \u2192 \u2212i a \u03c9a . In spacelike Liouville theory, for bulk amplitudes a\nrelated observation was made in [43]. In [14] it was observed for the bulk-boundary\namplitude in the decaying D-brane background. Then, ref. [25] constructed a detailed\ncontour integration method to show how boundary amplitudes reduce to the analytical continuation of a term. Following [14, 25] we expect that the bulk amplitude is\ngiven by a certain analytic continuation to negative N:\nZ\n\"\n\"\n||\n1\n\u03c0(2\u03c0\u03bb)\u2212\u03be\u2212\u03be2 1\n(k )2 \u2212(~k1\u22a5 )2\nA2 =\nZ2 (r, \u03be; N = \u2212\u03be \u2212 \u03be2 ) .\n(9)\ndrrr k1*k2 (1 \u2212 r 2 ) 2 1\nsin \u03c0(\u03be + \u03be2 ) 0\nIn the integrand of (9), at this point we only know the term Z2 through its\ndefinition in (8), which is quite complicated. However, it allows us to make some\nobservations about the pole structure of the amplitude. There singularities at each\nendpoint r = 0, 1 in the r integral give rise to pole structures, as in scattering from a\nstable D-brane [44], see [37] for a review.3 From (8) we can see that Z2 is real analytic\nat r = 0 and even in r. It is also analytic at r = 1 for Re \u03be > \u22121/2.

We shall discuss in detail only the case \u03be = \u03be2 where\nthe production amplitude is symmetric.5\n\n3\n\nElectrostatic calculation\n\nOur starting point is to view [14, 16, 25, 31] Z2 as the partition function of a Coulomb\ngas [45], with two additional external charges \u03be, \u03be2 at fixed positions. We write it in\nthe form\nZ Y\nN\n1\ndti \u22122H\nZ2 ({\u03bea }; N) =\ne\n,\n(12)\nN!\n2\u03c0\ni=1\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian H reads\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n\nlog |eiti \u2212 eitj | \u2212\n\nN X\n2\nX\ni=1 a=1\n\n\u03bea log |eiti \u2212 wa | ,\n\n(13)\n\nand we fixed the inverse temperature to \u03b2 = 2. As seen from the Hamiltonian, we\nhave an ensemble of N unit charges on the circle at eit1 , . . . , eitN , which interact via\n4\n\nSee Appendix B for a calculation of the series coefficients for N = 0, 1, 2, . . .. In particular, for\ninteger N one can extract from eqn. (71) that a2 = \u03be 2 \u03b4N >0 .\n5\nThe reason for this restriction is a puzzling observation for which we do not have a good explanation at the moment. When we use conformal symmetry to place the other vertex operator to\norigin and the other one to w = r, the amplitude (5)-(7) becomes asymmetric with respect to the\nexchange 1 \u2194 2 of the strings, if they have different energies, \u03be 6= \u03be2 . As a result, the poles seem not\nto respect the exchange symmetry. So, the use of conformal symmetry to fix the vertex positions\nin the rolling tachyon background involves a subtlety, unless \u03be = \u03be2 , in which case the strings are\nexchange symmetric \"in the time direction\".\n\n7\n\n\fthe Coulomb potential.6 They are subject to an external electric field created by two\nfixed charges.\nA useful strategy is to study the system using classical electrostatics, first in\nthe limit of large number N of unit charges. In this limit the unit charges can be\ntreated as a continuous charge distribution. Its density is modified by the external\ncharges \u03bea and we are interested in finding the electrostatic equilibrium configuration.\nNotice that the present system is analogous to the circular unitary ensemble [5] of\nrandom matrix theory, where the connection to the Coulomb gas is a standard tool.\nOur method indeed resembles the electrostatic derivation of Wigner's semi-circle law\n[46] (see also [47]). It is also reminiscent of the work of Gross and Mende [39],\nwho used electrostatic equilibrium conditions to identify the dominant saddle point\ncontributions to string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order to determine their\nhigh energy behavior. We will also consider the high energy limit (for the emitted\nstrings), but we restrict to the leading disk amplitude, which is already complicated\ndue to the charge density background. A more detailed description of our method\nand other applications will be discussed elsewhere [42], here we focus on aspects that\nare relevant for the bulk two-point amplitude.\nWe use a saddle point approach and write\nlog Z2 ({\u03bea }; N) \u2243 \u22122H0 \u2243 \u22122Etot ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere H0 is the minimum value of the Hamiltonian (13) and Etot is the (total) electrostatic energy of the corresponding equilibrium configuration with continuous charge\ndensities. The string production amplitude (9) requires N = \u2212\u03be \u2212 \u03be2 , so that we\nneed to study the electrostatic problem in the regime N \u223c \u03be \u223c \u03be2 . It turns out that\nnontrivial electrostatic configurations are indeed obtained when the external charges\nare of the same order as the sum of the unit charges. Slightly more precisely, the\nelectrostatic configurations of interest to us are in the limit N \u2192 \u221e with the ratios\nN/\u03be and N/\u03be2 fixed.7\nLet us then discuss how the total electrostatic energy Etot is calculated. The first\ningredient is the (complex) potential V (w), the physical potential is the real part\nU(w) = Re V (w) .\n\n(15)\n\nThe potential is sourced by the continuous charge density \u03c1(\u03c6) (by which we approxiH\nmate the N unit charges in the N \u2192 \u221e limit, with the normalization N = d\u03c6\u03c1(\u03c6))\nand the external charges \u03bea ,\nZ\n\u0001 X\nV (w) = \u2212 d\u03c6\u03c1(\u03c6) log w \u2212 ei\u03c6 \u2212\n\u03bea log(w \u2212 wa ) + const. .\n(16)\na\n\n6\n\nOther unstable D-brane backgrounds correspond to different Coulomb gases [32\u201334].\nRecall that the behavior of Z2 in the limit N \u2192 \u221e with \u03bea and wa fixed can be calculated by\nusing the asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants [14, 48\u201350].\n7\n\n8\n\n\fWe choose the zero level of the potential by setting the last constant term to zero.\nWe then need to find V (w) and \u03c1(\u03c6) in the equilibrium configuration. We are interested in the configurations where \u03c1(\u03c6) is strictly positive within a domain C of the\nunit circle and vanishes elsewhere.8 Then solving the equilibrium configuration reverts to a standard potential problem of classical electrostatics including the external\ncharges \u03bea and a conductor which fills the domain C. In particular, in the equilibrium\nconfiguration the physical potential U(ei\u03c6 ) must take a constant value,\nU(ei\u03c6 ) = U0 ,\n\n(17)\n\nin C: If the potential would vary within C, the charges on the conductor would be\nsubject to forces and move until the potential adjusts to a constant value.\nThe electrostatic energy is defined as the energy of the system in the equilibrium\nconfiguration, and may be expressed in terms of \u03c10 (\u03c6) as\nZ\n1\nEtot = \u2212\nd\u03c61 d\u03c62 \u03c10 (\u03c61 )\u03c10 (\u03c62 ) log ei\u03c61 \u2212 ei\u03c62\n2\nX Z\n\u2212\n\u03bea d\u03c6\u03c10 (\u03c6) log ei\u03c6 \u2212 wa\na\n\n\u2261 Ec + Ec\u2212\u03be .\n\n(18)\n\nWe again set a possible constant contribution to zero. Then the energy matches with\nthe continuum limit of the Hamiltonian (13) and thus approximates the saddle point\nvalue of \u2212 21 log Z2 . By using the fact that the physical potential U(ei\u03c6 ) is constant\nwithin the domain C of nonzero \u03c10 , we can express the result as\n1\nN\nU0 + Ec\u2212\u03be ,\n(19)\n2\n2\nwhere the first term includes one half of the \"interaction energy\" Ec\u2212\u03be . Hence, to\ncalculate Etot and the leading behavior of Z2 for large N \u223c \u03be \u223c \u03be2 , it is sufficient to\nfind U0 and Ec\u2212\u03be . We present a general method for this in Appendix C.\nIn the next two subsections we work out the electrostatics approximation of the\n(two-point) bulk amplitude explicitly. We can omit the charge \u03be2 at the origin since\nit does not affect the calculation. The treatment of the other (real) charge \u03be at the\nreal line with 0 < w1 = r < 1 is divided to two regimes, depending on the values\nof r and \u03be/N. For small values of r the charge \u03be affects the charge distribution on\nthe unit circle less, and it remains strictly positive for all \u03c6 = arg w. For r \u2192 1\n(assuming \u03be > 0) the charge \u03be creates a gap in the charge distribution on the circle\nin the interval \u2212\u03c6c < \u03c6 < \u03c6c .9 We discuss first the small r case.\nEtot =\n\n8\n\nIn this paper it is sufficient to assume that the domain C of non-zero \u03c1(\u03c6) is connected, that is,\nan arc.\n9\nThe distribution remains strictly positive if \u03be is negative and N > |\u03be|. We shall consider the\ngap creation only for positive \u03be where the r \u2192 1 limit of Z2 matches with the one-point boundary\nfunction [14].\n\n9\n\n\f3.1\n\nSmall r\n\nFor small r one needs to solve the potential problem on the unit disk (without gaps),\nwhich is easily done by using a mirror charge. One can check that U(ei\u03c6 ) = U0 = 0 in\nthis case when the constant term in (16) is set to zero. At electrostatic equilibrium,\nthe potential becomes\nV (w) = \u2212\u03be log\n\nw\u2212r\n.\n1 \u2212 wr\n\n(20)\n\nThe first part of (16), the contribution from the continuous distribution on the circle,\nbecomes Vc (w) = +\u03be log(1 \u2212 wr) at equilibrium, which in turn equals the potential\nof the mirror charge at w = 1/r. As mentioned above, we dropped the trivial contribution \u2212\u03be2 log w due to the charge at the origin which neither affects the charge\ndensities nor the total energy.

The absence of the gap\nrequires that \u03c1 is positive, i.e., that\nr<\n\nN\n\u2261 rc ,\nN + 2\u03be\n\n(22)\n\nwhich defines what we mean by \"small r\".

Hence in this limit we may use the result directly in (14),\nZ2 (\u03be; N) \u221d e\u22122Etot = 1 \u2212 r 2\n\n\u0001\u2212\u03be2\n\n;\n\nN \u2192\u221e,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich indeed reproduces exactly the large N result of eqn. (5.13) in [14]. However,\nas we will see next, at large r we obtain in general a different result.\n\n3.2\n\nLarge r\n\nAs we saw in (22), for r > N/(N + 2\u03be) there is a gap on the unit circle charge\ndistribution. The electrostatic problem becomes more difficult. We present a general\nmethod to find the equilibrium charge density in the presence of gaps in Appendix C.\nHere we focus on the results in the case of one gap n\u0302 = 1 and one external charge\nn = 1 which is relevant at large r.\n10\n\n\fAppendix C performs the calculation in a simplified geometry, where the unit disk\n(in w coordinates) is mapped onto the upper half plane (z coordinates) by\nz = q(w) = i\u03b2\n\n1\u2212w\n1\u2212w\n= i cot (\u03c6c /2)\n,\n1+w\n1+w\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c6c will parameterize the location of the gap in the charge density. In the\nelectrostatic problem (on the w plane), there is an induced image charge \u2212N \u2212 \u03be at\ninfinity, so that the net charge is zero. Following the point at infinity in the mapping\nq in (25), the image appears as an additional charge at z = q(\u221e) on the z plane. In\nthe notation of Appendix C the actual charge is \u03ben = \u03be1 \u2261 \u03be and the image charge is\n\u03ben+1 = \u03be2 :\n\u03be1 = \u03be\n\nat\n\nz = i\u03b4(r)\u03b2\n\n\u03be2 = \u2212N \u2212 \u03be\n\nat\n\nz = \u2212i\u03b2\n\n(w = r)\n(w = \u221e) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = cot(\u03c6c /2) and\n\n1\u2212r\n.\n(27)\n1+r\nThe asymptotic behavior of the electric field leads to a constraint (eqn.

In the bulk case there is a subtlety with analytic continuation of [14, 25]\nN \u2192 \u2212\u03be \u2212 \u03be2 . When r is kept fixed, the integral can be approximated by the \"large\nr\" result (32) for N . Nc , where Nc = 2\u03ber/(1 \u2212 r), whereas \"small r\" approximation\n(23) works for N & Nc . Thus there is a discontinuity at N = Nc , which leads to\napparent problems with the analytic continuation. The sum that we should calculate\nreads\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u01002 (z) \u223c\n(\u2212z)N Z2 (r, \u03be; N) \u2243\n(\u2212z)N e\u22122Etot ,\n(33)\nN =0\n\nN =0\n\nx0\n\nwhere z = 2\u03c0\u03bbe and Etot is given by either (32) if N . Nc or (23) if N & Nc .\nThe sum is well convergent and insensitive to the actual value of Nc for |z| < 1. For\ncontinuation to |z| > 1 we would like to apply the contour integral method of [25].\nHowever, the discontinuity at N = Nc seems to be problematic, if r is held fixed.\nThe sum \u01002 (z) is sensitive to Nc and consequently diverges fast for z \u2192 \u221e with an\narbitrary proportionality constant, whence it is not possible to integrate the amplitude\nover x0 . Working directly at imaginary \u03be = \u2212i\u03c9 might improve the convergence, but\nthe analytic continuation is still tricky.\nRemarkably, the problems disappear if r is integrated over first.

Now Z\u0304 is an analytic function of N, and can\nbe continued analytically to all complex N plane. It has a few branch cuts: branch\npoints are found whenever the endpoint of the integration, rc , hits singularities of the\nintegrand. Branches are given by the various winding possibilities of the integration\npath. The singularities are found at r = 0, \u00b11, and \u221e, giving for the branch points\nN = 0, \u2212\u03be, \u22122\u03be, and \u221e.\nIt is straightforward to check that Z\u0304 grows only as a power law as N \u2192 \u221e in\nany direction on the complex plane.

Let us define the kinematic variables\ns = k1 * k2\n||\n\n||\n\nt = 2(k1 )2 = 2(k2 )2 = 8 \u2212 (~k1\u22a5 )2 \u2212 (~k2\u22a5 )2\n(~k1\u22a5 \u2212 ~k2\u22a5 )2\n,\nu =\n2\n\n(40)\n\nwhich are motivated by the standard conventions (see Appendix A) for scattering from\na stable D-brane [37, 44] but should not be regarded as true Mandelstam variables.10\nWe have crossed s \u2194 t to obtain a setting which corresponds to string production by\nthe brane rather than scattering off the brane.\n10\n\nThese variables are not directly linked to 2 \u2192 2 scattering which is the case for the stable\nD-brane (Appendix A). For example, even after fixing \u03be = \u03be2 there are three independent kinematic\nvariables in the present case. Hence u cannot be expressed in terms of s and t in contrast to usual\n2 \u2192 2 scattering.\n\n13\n\n\fFor equal energies (37) is apparently singular, because N is continued analytically\nto the value \u22122\u03be where the integral has a branch point. Hence we need to check the\ndetails of the analytic continuation carefully. We choose a natural branch where the\ncontinuation is done from positive values of N via the path\nN = 2\u03beei\u03c6 ;\n\n\u03c6 = 0...\u03c0 .\n\n(41)\n\nThen, in particular, r\u0302c \u2192 \u221e along the positive imaginary axis, or more precisely the\npath Re r\u0302c = 1/2.

It is possible to check that the residues of the first few\npoles are in accord with the general expectations of Section 2.1. The last gamma\nfunction produces an additional pole at u = 0, while at u = 2 the expression in\nsquare brackets vanishes which cancels the next pole. The following poles at negative\nu are unphysical since u \u2265 0 by definition. The u = 0 singularity corresponds to\nproduction of strings which have parallel momenta in the directions perpendicular to\nthe Dp-brane, ~k1\u22a5 = ~k2\u22a5 , p < 25. The amplitude is also singular at \u03c9 = 0.\n\n4.1\n\nKinematic limits\n\nTo conclude our analysis, let us consider the asymptotic behavior of the \u03be = \u03be2\namplitude (43) in different kinematic limits. We notice that the kinematic variables\ncan be written as\ns = 4 \u2212 2(~k || )2 \u2212 (~k \u22a5 )2 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8)\nt = 8 \u2212 2(~k \u22a5 )2\n\nu = (~k \u22a5 )2 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) ,\n14\n\n(44)\n\n\fX\n\n25\n\n\u03b8\n\nk1\n\nk2\n\u03c8\n\nk1\n\u03c8\n\nk2\nk2\np+1\n\nX, ... , X\n\n24\n\nk1\nX,1 ... , X\n\np\n\nFigure 2: This figure illustrates the kinematic variables: the spatial momenta of the\nemitted strings ~ki with the angles \u03b8, \u03c8.\nwhere (~k \u22a5 )2 \u2261 (~k1\u22a5 )2 = (~k2\u22a5 )2 and \u03b8 is the angle between ~k1\u22a5 and ~k2\u22a5 (see figure 2).\nBefore going to the explicit asymptotics, we make an important general observation:\nthe amplitude in (43) vanishes exponentially ( \u223c e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9 or faster) in the high energy\nlimit. Recall that one-point amplitude [6] behaves as \u223c e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9 . This result follows\nsince the sums of the arguments of the two beta functions in (43) are bounded from\nabove,\nt+u\n1 + cos \u03b8\n\u2212 2 = 2 \u2212 (~k \u22a5 )2\n\u22642\n2\n2\ns+u\n= 2 \u2212 (~k || )2 \u2264 2 ,\n(45)\n2\nwhich excludes the region where the beta functions would grow exponentially for\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e. They can have a power-like behavior in \u03c9 if at least one of the sums is fixed\nfor \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, in which case the behavior \u223c e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9 arises from the factor 1/ sinh 2\u03c0\u03c9\nthat multiplies the beta functions. The same factor is responsible for the suppression\nof the one-point amplitude. In both cases the exponent contains the total energy of\nthe emitted strings. In particular this suggests that in the brane decay the two-string\nemission channel will be as important as the one-string channel. However, we would\nneed to study decay into massive string states and the phase space factors before\ndrawing conclusions.\nLet us consider the following special limits:\nI (~k || )2 \u2192 \u221e with (~k \u22a5 )2 fixed, corresponding to string production parallel to the\ndecaying brane\n\nII (~k \u22a5 )2 \u2192 \u221e with (~k || )2 (and \u03b8) fixed, corresponding to string production perpendicular to the decaying brane\n15\n\n\fIII (~k \u22a5 )2 \u2192 \u221e with (~k || )2 and (~k \u22a5 )2 (1 + cos \u03b8) (or equivalently ~k1\u22a5 + ~k2\u22a5 ) fixed,\ncorresponding to string production perpendicular to the decaying brane such\nthat the backreaction to the brane remains finite.\nNotice that all these limits are reasonable, since \u03c9 2 = ~k 2 \u22124 \u2192 \u221e in each case validating the electrostatic approximation. Recall that any subleading terms of the electrostatic approximation were not included, and hence results for subleading asymptotics\n(which we shall anyhow write down) are not reliable. Also notice that there are\nplenty of poles in the physically meaningful region. We only state the leading overall\nbehavior \"averaged over the poles\", so the subleading terms may be significant very\nnear their poles.\nThe limit I means taking s \u2192 \u2212\u221e with t and u fixed. For u > 2 the factor in\nthe square brackets of (43) approaches a constant since the latter, s dependent term\ndecays,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0s\ni\u03c0ei 2 (2\u03c0\u03bb)2i\u03c9 i \u03c0u \u0393 2t \u2212 1 \u0393 u2 \u2212 1\n\u0001\nA2 \u2243 \u2212\ne 2\n,\n(46)\n2 sinh 2\u03c0\u03c9\n\u0393 t+u\n\u22122\n2\nwhile for 0 < u < 2 the latter term dominates and we find\n\n\u03c0s\n\u0011 sin[\u03c0(s + u)/2] \u0010 s \u00111\u2212 u2\ni\u03c0ei 2 (2\u03c0\u03bb)2i\u03c9 \u0010 u\n\u2212\n\u0393\n\u22121\n.\nA2 \u2243\n2 sinh 2\u03c0\u03c9\n2\nsin[\u03c0s/2]\n2\n\n(47)\n\nThus for any u the absolute value of the amplitude vanishes exponentially \u223c e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9 ,\n2\nas expected. The amplitude has also a very rapidly varying phase \u223c e\u2212i\u03c0\u03c9 . The\nsubleading behavior which arises from the terms in the square brackets is likely to be\nmodified by the nonleading terms of the electrostatic limit which we have neglected.\nThe limit II corresponds to s, t \u2192 \u2212\u221e while u \u2192 +\u221e such that t + u \u2192 \u2212\u221e and\ns + u = 4 \u2212 2(~k || )2 remains fixed. Then the first term in the square brackets vanishes\nexponentially, and the contribution from the second term leads to\n\u03c0s\n\ni\u03c0ei 2 (2\u03c0\u03bb)2i\u03c9\nA2 \u2243\n2 sinh 2\u03c0\u03c9 \u0393\n\n\u03c0\n\u0001\ns+u\n2\n\nsin \u03c0s\n2\n\n\u0010 s \u0011 s+u\n\u22121\n2\n.\n\u2212\n2\n\n(48)\n\nHence the absolute value of the amplitude behaves as \u223c e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9 also in this case.\nThe limit III is otherwise the same as the limit II except that t+ u = 8 \u2212(~k \u22a5 )2 (1 +\ncos \u03b8) is fixed.

They are symmetric polynomials of N variables x1 , . . . xN , denoted by s\u03bb (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ) where \u03bb =\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbN ) is a partition of |\u03bb| = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + * * *+ \u03bbN with \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbN \u2265 0.\nThe partition may be identified with a Young diagram where the ith row has \u03bbi boxes.\nThe polynomials may be defined by\nh\ni\n\u03bb +N \u2212j\ndet xi j\nh\ni i,j=1,...N ,\ns\u03bb (xi ) =\n(64)\nN \u2212j\ndet xi\ni,j=1,...N\n\nwhere the denominator is the Vandermonde determinant \u2206(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ). The definition may be extended to partitions having more than N nonzero elements \u03bbi (or\n19\n\n\fto Young diagrams having more than N rows) by setting these polynomials to zero.\nWe denote by l(\u03bb) the index of the last nonzero element (or the height of the corresponding Young diagram).\nThe polynomials have the following well known identities [47]\nNy\nNx Y\nX\nY\n(1 + xi yj ) =\ns\u03bb (xi )s\u03bb\u2032 (yi )\ni=1 j=1\n\n(65)\n\n\u03bb\n\nNy\nNx Y\nY\n\n1\n1 \u2212 xi yj\ni=1 j=1\n\nX\n\n=\n\ns\u03bb (xi )s\u03bb (yi ) ,\n\n(66)\n\n\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032 is the conjugate partition of \u03bb, i.e., \u03bb\u2032i are the number of boxes in the columns\nof the Young diagram of \u03bb. Notice that since s\u03bb (xi ) vanishes if l(\u03bb) > Nx , the sum\nover \u03bb is restricted to a finite set of partitions with l(\u03bb) \u2264 Nx and \u03bb1 \u2264 Ny in the\nfirst identity, as expected since the left hand side is a polynomial in xi and yj . One\ncan also write down a generalized binomial theorem\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 xi )\u03be =\n\nX\n\nc\u03bb (\u03be)s\u03bb(xi ) ,\n\n(67)\n\n\u03bb\n\nwhere the coefficients c\u03bb (\u03be) are independent of N and polynomials in \u03be. They are\nwell known and are related to (65). When \u03be is a positive integer we can set in (65)\nNy = \u03be and y1 = \u22121 = y2 = * * * = y\u03be whence we see that the coefficient c\u03bb (\u03be) equals\ns\u03bb\u2032 (yi = \u22121). The result may be expressed in various forms:\n\u03bb\u2032i \u2212 i \u2212 \u03bb\u2032j + j\nj\u2212i\n1\u2264i<j\u2264\u03be\n\u0001\n\u2206 \u03bb\u2032\u03be + 1, \u03bb\u2032\u03be\u22121 + 2, . . . , \u03bb\u20321 + \u03be\n|\u03bb|\n= (\u22121)\n(\u03be \u2212 1)! * * * 1!\nY 1\n(\u03be + i(m) \u2212 j(m)) ,\n= (\u22121)|\u03bb|\nh\nm\nm\u2208\u03bb\n\nc\u03bb (\u03be) = (\u22121)|\u03bb| s\u03bb\u2032 (yi = 1) = (\u22121)|\u03bb|\n\nY\n\n(68)\n\nwhere the last form gives the number of terms in the Schur polynomial in terms of\nthe \"hook length\" hm (it also equals the number of the semistandard Young tableaux\nof the form \u03bb\u2032 and the dimension of the representation of SU(\u03be) characterized by \u03bb\u2032 ).\nHere i(m) (j(m)) is the number of row (column) of the box m in \u03bb. Since c\u03bb are\nindeed known to be polynomials in \u03be, the result in the last form readily extends to\nall complex values of \u03be. We may thus write the generalized binomial theorem as\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 rxi )\u03be =\n\nX\n\n(\u2212r)|\u03bb|\n\n\u03bb\n\nY 1\n(\u03be + i(m) \u2212 j(m)) s\u03bb (xi ) ,\nhm\nm\u2208\u03bb\n\nwhere we rescaled all variables by r.\n20\n\n(69)\n\n\fLet us then concentrate on the two-point function Z2 of (8). By using the formulae\n(69) we may write the \"cross-term\" in the integrand as\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n\u2212iti 2\u03be\n\n|1 \u2212 re\n\n|\n\n=\n\nN\nY\ni=1\n\n(1 \u2212 reiti )\u03be (1 \u2212 re\u2212iti )\u03be =\n\nX\n\n(\u2212r)|\u03bb|+|\u03bb\u0304| c\u03bb (\u03be)c\u03bb\u0304(\u03be)s\u03bb (xi )s\u03bb\u0304 (x\u2217i ) ,\n\n\u03bb,\u03bb\u0304\n\n(70)\nwhere xi = e . As the Schur polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight\nfunction of Z2 we immediately get\niti\n\nZ2 (r, \u03be; N) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb,l(\u03bb)\u2264N\n\nr 2|\u03bb| |c\u03bb (\u03be)|2 =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb,l(\u03bb)\u2264N\n\nr 2|\u03bb|\n\nY 1\n(\u03be + i(m) \u2212 j(m))2 ,\n2\nh\nm\u2208\u03bb m\n\n(71)\n\nwhere the constraint l(\u03bb) \u2264 N appears since the polynomials s\u03bb (xi ) vanish for l(\u03bb) >\nN. If \u03be is a positive integer the sum over \u03bb is finite because the coefficients c\u03bb (\u03be)\nvanish for \u03bb1 > \u03be. Moreover, if \u03be is a negative integer and N \u2265 |\u03be| the sum can be\ndone explicitly as a special case of the general result found in [24]:\n2\n\nZ2 (r, \u03be; N) = (1 \u2212 r 2 )\u2212\u03be ;\n\nC\n\n\u03be = \u22121, \u22122, . . . , \u2212N .\n\n(72)\n\nSolutions to the potential problems\n\nWe are interested in solving potential problems in classical electrostatics where the\nconductors are pieces of the arc of the unit circle. The general potential problem has\nas conductors n\u0302 separate arcs of the unit circle. We find it useful to map the disk\nonto the upper half plane by the conformal map\nw 7\u2192 z = i\u03b2\n\n1\u2212w\n\u2261 q(w)\n1+w\n\n(73)\n\nwith the understanding that we work in the compactified complex plane with the\n\u221e-point included. Here \u03b2 is a real parameter.\nThe analytic properties of the complex electric field allow us to write down the\nsolution in a special form [47]. Let us assume for a moment that we have two conductors, n\u0302 = 2, which lie at [a, b] and at [c, d]. We can then define the following\nfunctions\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nz\u2212a z\u2212b z\u2212c z\u2212d\ng(z) =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nz\u2212a b\u2212z c\u2212z d\u2212z ,\n(74)\nh(z) =\nwhere the principal branch of the square root function is used. Then g(z) is analytic everywhere except on the conductors where it has branch cuts, whereas h(z) is\nanalytic over the conductors, but has branch cuts in the gap regions.\n21\n\n\fGeneralization to n\u0302 conductors is found by adding more terms to g(z) and h(z).\nWe choose the branches such that\nh(z) = \u2213ig(z) ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere the minus sign holds in the upper half plane and the plus sign holds in the\nlower half plane. It is then possible to show that, when exposed to an appropriate\nexternal (conjugate) electric field Eext (z), a solution for the (conjugate) electric field\ndue to the conductors reads\nZ\n1\nRe Eext (t)\nEc (z) = g(z)\ndt\n,\n(76)\n\u03c0\n(z \u2212 t)h(t)\ncond\nwhere the integration is over the conductors. Notice that the solution is bounded\nat the conductor endpoints. It is well defined everywhere except on the conductors,\nwhere it has discontinuities. The charge density12 is proportional to the discontinuity\nand becomes\nZ\n1 Re Eext (z) \u2212 Re Eext (t)\n1\ndt\n.\n(77)\n\u03c1(z) = 2 h(z)\n\u03c0\nh(t)\nz\u2212t\ncond\nThe 2n\u0302 endpoints of the conductors are not arbitrary parameters but are subject\nto constraints. In particular, these parameters (the constants a, b, c, and d in the\nn\u0302 = 2 case) are partially fixed by the asymptotics of the electric field\nEc (z) \u223c\n\nN\nz\n\nfor z \u2192 \u221e where N is the total electric charge on the conductors. This gives\nZ\ntk Re Eext (t)\n,\nk = 0, . . . , n\u0302 \u2212 1\n0 =\ndt\nh(t)\ncond\nZ\ntn\u0302 Re Eext (t)\n\u03c0N =\ndt\n.\nh(t)\ncond\n\n(78)\n\n(79)\n\nThere are n\u0302 \u2212 1 parameters left free, which are identified as the potential differences\nbetween the conducting planes. We will set these to zero and thus require\nZ\nRe\ndzE(z) = 0 ,\nk = 2, . . . , n\u0302 ,\n(80)\nCk\n\nwhere\nE(z) = Ec (z) + Eext (z)\n\n(81)\n\nis the total electric field and the curve Ck connects the first conductor with the kth\none without intersecting the other conductors, for example.\n12\n\nFor brevity, we omit the subscript 0 which was used in the main text.\n\n22\n\n\fFor the case of interest to us, the external field is due to n point like charges,\nEext (z) =\n\nn\nX\na=1\n\n\u03bea\n\n1\n.\nz \u2212 za\n\n(82)\n\nFor this configuration the integrals above can be calculated exactly by using contour\nintegration methods.

Let us denote\nthe corresponding electric field and potential, as given by eqs.
