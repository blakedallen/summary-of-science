In systems with short range interactions the main aggregation\nfeatures are well understood (author?) [1]. Diffusion limited cluster-cluster aggregation\n(CCA) model (author?) [2, 3] and dynamic scaling theory (author?) [4] explain well the\nscaling properties during aggregation. It was found that these models, initialy developed\nfor systems with short range interactions, can be used in systems where dipole-dipole interaction is dominant, for example aggregation of magnetic microspheres (author?) [5, 6],\naggregation of nanoparticles in magnetic fluid (author?) [7] and aggregation of magnetic\nholes (author?) [8]. These experimental results show scaling of the significant parameters\nand features typical of CCA. On the other hand, the corresponding exponents may deviate\nslighly from the known models, and the reasons for this is still not understood.\nOur previous results (author?) [8] served as motivation for this study. Aggregation of\nmagnetic holes in constant magnetic fields was interpreted in frames of the CCA model and\ndynamic scaling theory. The scaling exponent z \u2248 0.42 for the cluster size dependence S(t) \u223c\ntz was found for particles of diameters d = 1.9 and 4\u03bcm. This value of the exponent is slighly\nlower than exponent values predicted by theory (z = 0.5) (author?) [2] or exponents found\nby computer simulations (z = 0.5 for isotropic and z = 0.61 for anisotropic aggregation)\n(author?) [9]. Under certain experimental conditions (i.e., particles with larger diameter\nd = 14 \u03bcm) the exponent z was close to or lower than the exponent value corresponding\nto a transition from 2D aggregation to 1D aggregation (z = 1/3). Based on these optical\nobservations we know that for a constant magnetic field clusters move in 2D but they grow\nonly in one dimension.\nThe constant magnetic fields induced formation of long chains of particles (author?)\n[6, 8]. To determine correct scaling exponents we may take into account hydrodynamic\neffects (author?) [9]. We proposed to apply rotating magnetic fields to ensure quasi isotropic\nproperties inside the magnetic fluid (MF) sample. In this case clusters can move in 2D space\nand can grow as 2D compact objects and thus the hydrodynamic correction is less important.\nThe dynamic properties of a few magnetic holes (author?) [10] in rotating magnetic fields\nshow interesting phenomena, for example nonlinear response of bound pairs of magnetic holes\n(author?) [11], complex braid dynamics (author?) [12], and equilibrium configurations\n2\n\n\fFIG. 1: (colour online) Experimental setup used to study aggregation of magnetic holes. A rotating\nmagnetic field H(t) is applied in the plane of the magnetic fluid.\n\nof rotating particles without contact between particles (author?) [13]. In a precessing\nmagnetic field paramagnetic particles dispersed in a drop of water self-assemble into twodimensional viscoelastic small clusters (author?) [14].\nIn the present study field induced aggregation of many magnetic holes has been observed.\nIn Sec. II the experimental equipment and the methods used are described. The Sec. III\ndeals with the results concerning the determination of the scaling exponents and characterization of the diffusion behaviour of individual clusters by tracking of their motions. In\nSec. IV we summarize the general features and try to explain the non-universal scaling\nexponents. Our conclusions follow in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nMICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe experimental setup shown in Fig. 1 consists of an optical microscope (Nikon Optiphot), two pairs of coils, and a carefully prepared thin layer sample. Alternating curents\nwere supplied to the coils in order to produce a magnetic field rotating in the horizontal\nplane of the sample. Microscopic observations were captured by a CCD camera (Q-Imaging\nMicropublisher 5) with resulution 2560 \u00d7 1920 pixels.\nThe sample size was about 20 \u00d7 20 mm2 . A layer of magnetic fluid of thickness approximately 50 \u03bcm was confined between two glass plates and sealed. The kerosene based\nmagnetic fluid (author?) [15] had the following physical properies: density \u03c1 = 1020 kgm3 ,\nsusceptibility \u03c7 = 0.8, saturation magnetization Ms = 20mT, and viscosity \u03b7 = 6\u00d7103 Nsm2 .\n3\n\n\fMonodisperse polystyrene microspheres of diameter d = 3\u03bcm were dispersed in the MF layer\nin order to create magnetic holes in presence of magnetic fields.\nWithout a magnetic field the particles are homogeneously dispersed in the layer and they\ncan move freely. After some time a very low fraction of particles may randomly join to other\nparticles and a few dimers were observed (author?) [10]. Their volume fraction is very low\nin comparison with the volume fraction of single particles. However, before the application\nof the rotating magnetic field, a short magnetic field pulse perpendicular to the sample\n(coils are not shown in Fig. 1) was applied in order to destroy these dimers and to create\na monodisperse initial size distribution of particles. This initial stage of the experiment is\nnot shown in Fig. 2.\nThe rotating magnetic field H(t) = (Hx , Hy ) within the x \u2212 y plane had the components: Hx = H sin(\u03c9t) and Hy = H sin(\u03c9t + \u03c0/2). The amplitude of the magnetic field was\nconstant H = 793 Am\u22121 , and angular velocity \u03c9 = 251 s\u22121 . The temperature during the ex.\nperiments was T = 293 K. The effective volume susceptibility including the demagnetization\ncorrection for spherical magnetic holes was \u03c7ef f = \u03c7/(1 + 2\u03c7/3) = 0.63. The dimensionless\n.\ndip\ndip\ninteraction strength parameter (author?) [8] was \u03bb = 90. Here, \u03bb = Umax\n/kT , where Umax\nis maximal dipolar energy of two joined dipolar particles, k is Boltzmann's constant and\nT is the temperature. Thus, dipole-dipole interaction among magnetic holes was dominant\nover the thermal fluctuations.\nThe rotating magnetic field induced an aggregation of the microspheres. The process took\nplace via the joining of single particles into dimers, trimers and formation of 2D clusters\nconsisting of many particles. These new clusters aggregate again and formed bigger clusters.\nA typical aggregation dynamics is shown in Fig. 2. A few samples with approximately the\nsame layer thickness were investigated. The volume fractions of particles were low, in the\nrange \u03c6 = 0.0014 \u2212 0.0064.\nIn order to analyze the digital images, a C programing language code and open graphical\nlibraries were used. Several thousands of digital pictures have been analyzed in a distributed\nmanner in a computational grid. We have analyzed the motion of individual particles during\naggregation using our own tracking algorithms written in the Python programing language.\nThe main advantage of the algorithm that was used is that it can track positions of new\nclusters which are results of the aggregation.\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: Optical micrographs of aggregation of nonmagnetic microspheres with diameter d = 3\u03bcm\nin magnetic fluid at different times: (a) t = 600 s, (b) t = 3000 s, and (c) t = 3400 s after the\nmagnetic field was switched on. The applied rotating magnetic field had an amplitude |H| = 793\nAm\u22121 and frequency f = 40 Hz. The optical view covers a sample area of about 368 \u03bcm\u00d7274 \u03bcm.\n\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMicrospheres inside a magnetic fluid layer witout magnetic field behave as nonmagnetic\nparticles dispersed in fluid. They perform random Brownian motion. In this case, aggregation events are rare due to the low particle concentration. Thus, in the initial stage of\nthe experiments the microsperes are homogeneously dispersed in the layer of MF and the\ncluster size distribution is unimodal.\nAfter application of the external magnetic field the microspheres begin to behave as\ninteracting magnetic holes. They have induced magnetic moments which are oppositely\noriented to the external magnetic field. When the energy of dipole-dipole interaction among\ntwo arbitrary spheres is larger than the thermal energy of the spheres, as quantified by the\n.\ndimensionless interaction strength \u03bb = 90 in the present case, field induced aggregation\nstarts.\nDuring the aggregation complex motions of microsperes and clusters consisting of many\nmicrospheres were observed. Clusters containing regularly ordered particles were formed\nand small irregular clusters relatively quickly relax to highly ordered structures. Based on\nthe optical observation the complex modes of motion of microsperes and clusters may be\nclassified as; i) joining of two clusters together followed by a very slow relaxation of the\nmicrosperes in the new cluster into a more ordered structure; ii) extremely slowly swivelling\nof all clusters in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field, followed by packing into a\ncompact disk form; and iii) small random motions of the clusters induced by random forces\nresulting from interactions with the local cluster environment.\nWe have observed that clusters of all sizes can join together and form bigger cluster\nwhich is the basic feature of cluster-cluster aggregation. The cluster-cluster aggregation\nmodel (author?) [2] predicts the scaling properties of the total number of clusters N(t) and\nP\nmean cluster size S(t). The total number of clusters is defined as N(t) = s ns (t) where\nns (t) is number of clusters of size s at time t. The mean cluster size S(t) is defined as:\nP\nns (t)s2\nS(t) = Ps\ns ns (t)s\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is cluster size. In our case the cluster size s is given by the number of particles\nwhich belong to the cluster.\nThe aggregation process in Fig. 2 was studied in more details.

Here the scaling exponents were found to be z \u2032 = 0.40 \u00b1 0.03 and z = 0.34 \u00b1 0.02.\nSimilarily to the case discussed above, the cluster numbers ns (t) (t = 200\u221280000 s) that were\nmeasured for this sample could be scaled onto a single curve as shown in Fig. 4 (b), but the\nscaling exponent \u2206 was nearly twice as large is in the former case, \u2206 = 2.75\u00b10.06. Also in\nthis case the visible dynamic behaviour was consistent with diffusion limited cluster-cluster\naggregation but with clearly different scaling exponents from those above.\nThe results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 show that the scaling exponents for this system\n8\n\n\fFIG. 5: (color online) Tracks of particles and clusters in the experiment shown in Figs. 2 and 3\nduring the time interval t = 0 \u2212 3400 s.

The sample area\nis about 368 \u03bcm\u00d7274 \u03bcm.\n\ncan not be universal. In order to understand this unexpected result we have investigated\nthe motions of individual clusters in more detail.\nThe complex motion of a cluster was simplified by considering only the motion of its\ncentral mass point. There are effects that can change the position of the central mass point\nwith nearly no motion of the cluster as a whole. For example, after joining of two clusters a\nrearrangement of particles in the new cluster (see the case i) discussed above) takes place.\nWe assume that these disturbing changes are smaller than the influence of random local\nforces (case iii)) that essentially contribute to the cluster motions. A very slow rotation of\na cluster (case ii)) does not change the position of the central mass point.\nCluster tracks shown in Fig. 5 (Fig. 6) were determined for experimental data shown\nin Fig. 3 (Fig. 4). We see in Figs. 5 and 6 that the clusters moved in two directions, the\ntracks are complex and show features of Brownian motion as expected.\nFor Brownian particles it is characteristic that their motion is well described by\n< |r|2 >\u221d Dt,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere r is the distance vector between an initial position and the position after time t and\nD is the diffusion coefficient. We checked the validity of Eq. 3 for the cluster tracks and\ndetermined the relation Ds \u221d< |r|2 > /t for any cluster of the size s. At each experiment\nwe analyzed about 1000 tracks and found that this equation is valid with a cluster-size\n9\n\n\fFIG. 6: (color online) Tracks of particles and clusters during aggregation in the time interval\nt = 0 \u2212 3400 s.

These ranges of values of Ds are significantly larger than possible errors of\nmeasurement.

For the data presented in\nFigs. 3 and 5 the diffusion scaling exponent \u03b3 = \u22120.62\u00b10.19 was found. On the other hand,\nfor the data in Figs. 4 and 6 the diffusion scaling exponent is clearly higher \u03b3 = \u22122.08\u00b10.51.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have observed that application of a rotating magnetic field on a 2D magnetic many\nholes system causes field induced aggregation. The clusters move and can grow in both\ndimensions, which is different from the case of a constant magnetic field where clusters\nare free to move in both dimensions but only grow in one dimension as determined by the\nexternal magnetic field. The results show that the system is in a nonequilibrium state and its\ncharacteristic quantities, number of clusters N(t) and average cluster size S(t), develope and\nshow scaling according to a cluster-cluster aggregation model (author?) [2] as was shown\nin Figs. 3a) and 4a). Both the scaling properties and the broad cluster size distributions\nfound, as well as the existence of a scaling function g(x), are main signatures of cluster-\n\n10\n\n\f1\n\n<D >\n\nDs \u221d <r2>/t (\u03bcm2 /s)\n\ns\n\n(a)\n\n\u221d s -0.62\u00b10\n\n.19\n\n10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n10-4\n10-5\n10\n\n102\nCluster size s (\u03bc m2 )\n\nDs \u221d <r2>/t (\u03bc m2/s)\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n10-1\n\n<D\n\n10-2\n\ns>\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n\u221d\n\ns -2.\n\n08\n\n\u00b10\n.\n\n51\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10-5\n\n10\n\n102\nCluster size s (\u03bc m2 )\n\nFIG. 7: (color online) The diffusion coefficients vs. cluster size s.

[4].\nIn many cases the cluster-cluster aggregation mechanism leads to formation of complex,\nfractal-like objects (author?) [1]. However, in the present case the structure of the aggregates are simpler with a compact internal organization. In relatively strong magnetic fields,\nsmall clusters are regular 2D objects with well ordered structure of the particles inside the\nclusters. Extremely slow cluster rotations and rearrangement of particles inside the new,\nbigger clusters have been observed. As a consequence of these effects the clusters are packed\ninto regular objects with a nearly close-packed, triangular structure of the spheres. The\ncluster diffusion coefficients do not depend on the direction in which the clusters move, i.e.,\nhydrodynamic corrections are not important as they are in case of constant magnetic fields\n(author?) [9].\n11\n\n\fIn the basic cluster-cluster aggregation model (author?) [2] it is assumed that the diffusion coefficient is \u03b3 = \u22121 and the corresponding scaling exponent is z = 0.5. We have\ndetermined two distinct values for the diffusion coefficients \u03b3 and scaling exponents z as\na result of the two clearly different types of behaviour observed in our experiments. The\nrelationship between \u03b3 and z for both values of \u03b3 follows the equation z = 1/(1 \u2212 \u03b3) which\nhas been found in other aggregation models. For \u03b3 = \u22120.62 \u00b1 0.19 (\u03b3 = \u22122.08 \u00b1 0.51)\nwe computed z = 0.62 (z = 0.32). These scaling exponents agree well with exponents z\ndetermined directly from the time dependence of S(t), z = 0.64 \u00b1 0.01 and z = 0.34\u00b10.02,\nrespectively.\nUnfortunately, at present we are not able to explain why similar experiments on approximately the same samples (concentrations, layer thickness etc.) show scaling exponents with\nvalues that come in two clearly separated ranges and diffusion exponents \u03b3 which are different from the expected value \u03b3 = \u22121. Thus, the scaling exponent z is either clearly lower or\nhigher than the theoretically predicted value z = 0.5.\nIn an earlier study of a similar system of magnetic holes in a constant magnetic fields\n(author?) [8] it was found that for small microspheres (diameters d = 1.9 \u2212 4.0\u03bcm and\ninteraction strength \u03bb = 8 \u2212 370) the scaling exponents z and z \u2032 were approximately equal\n.\nz = z \u2032 and typically slightly lower than 0.5: 0.38\u2264 z, z \u2032 \u2264 0.54. However, for larger particles,\nd = 14\u03bcm (\u03bb = 1040 \u2212 10600) the values of z and z \u2032 increased with the value of the\ndimensionless interaction strength \u03bb from about 0.1 to 0.6, and correspondingly the value\nof \u2206 decreased from above 3.0 to \u223c 1.5. Thus, depending on the particle size the scaling\nexponents changed from being nearly constant and near the theoretically expected values\nto being strongly non-universal. Although the present particles are within the diameter\nand \u03bb ranges which showed nearly universal behaviour in Ref. (author?) [8], the magnetic\ninteractions are very different (anisotropic in the former and isotropic in the present) and\nthen the range of \u03bb for which the behaviour in non-universal, seems to be changed. It is\nunclear why the diffusion conditions, as quantified by the values of the diffusion coefficients\n\u03b3, were so different in the two typical cases reported here. It may possibly be related to fine\ndetails in the interaction between the microspheres and the glass plates confining the system.\nIn principle the magnetic holes should be repelled from the confining walls (author?) [10]\nbut if for some unknown reason a small fraction of the particles become attracted or even\nloosely attached to the walls, this would slow down the diffusion as shown by the anomalous\n12\n\n\fvalue \u03b3 \u2248 \u22122 in one of the analyzed cases. Extremely small values of < Ds > could indicate\nthat some of the particles are trapped in the sample volume or on the sample glass boundary.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDiffusion limited cluster-cluster aggregation of magnetic holes has been induced by a\nrotating magnetic field. The main features of the experimental results are well described\nby a diffusion limited cluster-cluster aggregation model and dynamic scaling theory. The\nexperimental conditions were designed in effort to have a well defined model of a low concentrated many body system where long range interactions are dominant. At present, the\nreason why two main aggregation regimes were observed is not clear. This resulted in scaling exponent values clearly different from those predicted by theory for systems with short\nrange interactions. This difference in behaviour was further confirmed by unusual values\nof the scaling exponent \u03b3 of the diffusion coefficient that were found by cluster tracking.\nAn open question remains: Why do the isotropic, long-range particle-particle interactions\nsuppress the diffusion regime where the size-dependence of the diffusion coefficient scales\nwith \u03b3 = \u22121? This will hopefully be clarified in future studies.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Arne T. Skjeltorp for many stimulating discussions.
