Neutrons were measured\nin coincidence with 24 O fragments. 26 O was determined to be unbound by 150+50\n\u2212150 keV from the\nobservation of low-energy neutrons. This result agrees with recent shell model calculations based\non microscopic two- and three-nucleon forces.\n\nA major challenge in nuclear physics remains the description of nuclei based on fundamental interactions.\n\"Ab-initio\" approaches have been developed to calculate\nnuclear properties based on nucleon\u2013nucleon scattering\ndata up to A \u223c 12 [1]. Recent advances in nuclear theory made it possible to describe some fundamental properties of light nuclei up to oxygen based on two- and\nthree-nucleon interactions [2\u20136]. On the way to heavier\nnuclides it will be critical for these models to describe the\ndramatic change in the location of the neutron dripline\nfrom oxygen (N = 16) to fluorine (N \u2265 22) which was\nfirst pointed out by Sakurai et al. [7]. The addition of\none proton binds at least six additional neutrons. The\ntwo-neutron separation energy of 26 O serves as an important benchmark for these calculations. The majority\nof the current nuclear structure models predict 26 O to be\nbound [8\u201313]. Experimentally it has been shown that 24 O\nis bound [14] while repeated searches for bound 25 O and\n26\nO have been unsuccessful [15\u201321], although 25 O had initially been reported as being particle stable [22]. Shellmodel calculations using phenomenological interactions\ndo predict 26 O to be unbound: SDPF-M [23] by 77 keV\nand USD05a [24] by 510 keV. A continuum shell model\ncalculation predicts 26 O to be unbound by only 21 keV\n[25]. Recently it was shown that three-body forces are\nnecessary to describe the binding energies of neutron-rich\noxygen isotopes based on fundamental nucleon\u2013nucleon\nforces [4]. However, no calculations have been published\nwhich simultaneously predict 26 O to be unbound and 31 F\nto be bound.\nBecause no bound states of 26 O exist, the search for\nits elusive ground state must be extended to unbound\nstates. The unbound ground state of 25 O was measured\nusing invariant mass spectroscopy and was found to have\na decay energy of 770+20\n\u221210 keV [26]. Due to this high\nground-state energy of 25 O it is likely that 26 O is bound\nwith respect to one-neutron emission and unbound with\n\n26\n\nF(-p)\n\n27\n\nF(-p)\n\n3\nE (MeV)\n\narXiv:1202.3973v1 [nucl-ex] 17 Feb 2012\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n24\n\nO+2n\n\n25\n\nO+n\n\n26\n\nO\n\nFIG. 1:\nSchematic decay level scheme of 26 O.

Possible decay channels from 26 O are shown by\nthe dotted arrows.\n\nrespect to two-neutron emission. 26 O is thus also an excellent candidate for di-neutron emission. Furthermore\ncalculations by Grigorenko et al. predict that the emission of a pair of correlated neutrons might be hindered\nso that for very low decay energies lifetimes on the order\nof pico- to nanoseconds could be possible [27].\nWe searched for unbound states in 26 O using oneproton knockout reactions from 27 F and by measuring\nneutrons in coincidence with 24 O fragments. Figure 1\nshows a schematic level scheme of the possible decay\npaths for predicted states of 26 O.

The three oxygen\nisotopes 22 O, 23 O, and 24 O were identified as indicated in\nthe figure. The grey-shaded area corresponds to the events\nincluded in the present analysis for the decay of 25 O and 26 O.\n\nThe experiment was performed at the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. A\nprimary beam of 140 MeV/u 48 Ca20+ bombarded a\n1316 mg/cm2 9 Be production target. The desired 27 F\nsecondary beam with an energy of 82 MeV/u was separated from the other reaction products, and primary\nbeam, using the A1900 fragment separator [28] with a\n1050 mg/cm2 Al wedge placed at the intermediate focal plane. The 27 F component of the secondary beam\nwas 7% with the main contaminant being 30 Na. The 27 F\nfragments were identified event-by-event through time-offlight, and the average intensity was 14 per second with a\nmomentum spread of 2.5%. The 27 F beam then impinged\non a 705 mg/cm2 Be target producing the isotope of interest, 26 O, through one-proton removal reactions. Measurement of the 26 O \u2192 24 O + 2n decay required detection of both the neutrons and a charged particle. Beyond\nthe reaction target, the large-gap 4 Tm superconducting dipole (Sweeper) magnet [29] was used to bend the\ncharged particles 43\u25e6 after which they passed through\na set of position and energy sensitive detectors. The\n24\nO fragments were identified by time-of-flight and energy loss in the charged particle detectors. The Modular\nNeutron Array (MoNA) [30] was placed 6.05 m from the\nreaction target and measured the angle and energy (from\ntime-of-flight) of the forward-focused beam-velocity neutrons. The charged particle detectors and MoNA provide\nthe relativistic four-momentum vectors for the 24 O nuclei\nand neutrons that were used to calculate the decay energy\nof the two-body (fragment + n) or three-body (fragment\n+ n + n) systems.

Further details about the\nexperimental set-up, parameters and analysis procedures\ncan be found in references [26, 31\u201334].\nFigure 2 shows the particle identification spectrum for\nthe oxygen isotopes. The events included in the further\nanalysis are shown by the grey-shaded area. With this\nstringent cut the contamination of 23 O events was limited\nto about 1%.\nThe decay energy spectrum for the two-body (fragment\n+ n) system corresponding to 25 O is shown in Figure 3.\n25\nO previously had been measured and exhibited a resonance with a decay energy of 770+20\n\u221210 keV [26]. The solid\nline is representative of this resonance. It is immediately\nobvious that the data from the present one-proton knockout reaction from 27 F (data points) has a completely different shape with an additional strong peak at low decay energies. Because these low-decay energy neutrons\ncannot come from 25 O they have to originate from 26 O.\nThis initial evidence for a low energy resonance in 26 O\nis substantiated by the presence of a low-energy peak in\nthe reconstructed three-body (fragment + n + n) system\ncorresponding to 26 O as shown in Figure 4 (b). It should\nbe mentioned that in the present experiment as well as in\nthe experiment of reference [34] data were also recorded\nfor neutrons in coincidence with 23 O + n, and the measured decay energy spectra from the two experiments are\nin agreement.\nThe three-body decay energy spectrum shown in Figure 4 (b) was reconstructed from a 24 O fragment and two\nneutron interactions in MoNA. Thus, the spectrum also\ncontains cross-talk events from a single neutron scattering twice. The broad distribution of counts up to approximately 3 MeV in the three-body decay energy spectrum\ncould be due to the ground state of 25 O where the neutron scattered twice and/or the sequential decay from\nexcited states in 26 O through the 25 O ground state.

The grey area in (b) represents the simulated cross-talk contribution. The individual contributions to the cross-talk\nfrom the different simulated states are shown in the inset. Panel (c) shows the cross-talk subtracted 26 O spectrum. Panel (d)\nshows the 26 O spectrum with causality cuts applied to the data as well as the simulation. The lines are explained in the text.\n\norder to fit the data, we performed Monte Carlo simulations which included the geometrical acceptances, energy,\npositions, and timing resolution, tracking of the charged\nparticles through the Sweeper magnet, and the reaction\nand decay mechanisms. The interaction of the neutrons\nwith MoNA was described using the Geant4 simulation\npackage [35] with the addition of the MENATE-R physics\nclass [36]. Thus, multiple interaction of a single neutron\nwere fully included in the simulations.\nA low-energy resonance was simulated with a BreitWigner line shape and the energy from the 26 O decay\ninto 24 O and two neutrons was partitioned between the\nthree outgoing particles according to the phase-space\nmodel of references [37, 38]. The data are not sensitive\nto the detailed parameters of the various possible contributions to the high energy continuum. As shown in\nFigure 1, the continuum shell model predicts only one\nexcited state for 26 O at approximately 2 MeV with the\nnext excited state calculated at about 6 MeV [25]. Thus,\na resonance in 26 O at a fixed energy of 2 MeV with a\nwidth of 200 keV, which was allowed to decay sequentially via the known unbound ground state of 25 O, was\nincluded in the simulation. The resonance parameters for\n25\nO (Edecay = 770 keV, \u0393decay = 172 keV, L = 2) were\ntaken from reference [26]. A \u03c72 fit to the two-body and\n\nthree-body system was performed where the resonance\nenergy and width of the low-energy resonance and the\nrelative strengths of the three contributions (low-energy\nand 2 MeV state in 26 O and the ground state of 25 O)\nwere free parameters.\nFigure 4 shows the resulting simulated spectra for the\nbest fit parameters (solid line). The two-body and threebody systems are shown on panels (a) and (b), respectively. The low-energy resonance in 26 O at Edecay =\n150 keV and \u0393decay = 5 keV is shown by the long-dashed\nred line and the 2 MeV resonance by the short-dashed\ngreen line. The dot-dashed blue line shows the contribution from the direct population of the 25 O ground state.\nThese decay paths are also indicated in the inset of Figure 4(a). In the simulation it is possible to distinguish\nreal two-neutron detection from cross-talk events where\na single neutron interacted twice in MoNA. The greyshaded area in Figure 4 (b) shows the contributions of\nthe simulated cross-talk events to the total spectrum. In\nthe inset the individual contributions to the cross-talk\nfrom the low- and high-energy 26 O decays as well as the\ncontribution from the 25 O are shown. In order to demonstrate the positive signal of real 2n events we applied\ntwo different methods. First we subtracted the simulated cross-talk events from the data, and the results are\n\n\f4\n\n\u2217\n\nthoennessen@nscl.msu.edu\n\n35\n\n24\n\nO+n+n\n\n30\n\nCounts / 210 KeV\n\nshown in Figure 4(c). While the high-energy events are\nessentially reduced to background level, the low-energy\npeak is clearly still present. In a second method we applied causality cuts to the data. Following the description\nof references [39, 40] we required a spatial (25 cm) and\nvelocity (7 cm/ns) separation of two interactions in the\ndata as well as in the simulation. At the expense of a reduction of \u223c50% in efficiency, the cross-talk contribution\nwas reduced by a factor of three. The results are shown\nin figure 4(d) which again clearly shows the presence of\nthe low energy peak of real two-neutron events.\nThe best fit to the data included a resonance for the\n26\nO ground state of 150+50\n\u2212150 keV. This value agrees with\nthe recent calculations of a low-energy unbound resonance in 26 O [4, 25]. The fit was insensitive to the width\nof the resonance. The cross section for populating the\n26\nO ground state was 1.8\u00b11.0 mb while the cross section\nfor populating 25 O was 4.2\u00b12 mb. These values are consistent with 1p and 1p1n removal cross sections from 24 F,\n25\nF and 26 F. While the measured values for 24 F agreed\nwith the calculated removal cross sections the cross sections decreased with increasing neutron number [18].\nOne might speculate that the low-energy neutron originates from a state located around 900 keV and then\ndecays with a \u223c100 keV neutron sequentially via the\nground state of 25 O. The observed low energy peak would\nthen be solely due to the low-energy neutron scattering twice in MoNA. We simulated such a decay and the\nresults are shown in Figure 5. In addition to the total fit (solid line), the figure also shows the individual\ncontributions from real two-neutron coincidences (longdashed blue line) and from events where either the low- or\nthe high-energy neutron scatters twice in MoNA (shortdashed red line). Clearly, this sequential decay scenario\nis not supported by the data.\nIn conclusion, we present evidence for the observation\nof the 26 O ground state which is unbound by less than\n200 keV and which decays by emitting two low-energy\nneutrons. A future experiment with higher statistics is\nnecessary to study the detail of the decay mechanism,\ni.e. explore the possibility of a di-neutron decay. The\nupper limit for the total decay energy leaves open the\nexciting prospect that a di-neutron decay of 26 O might\nhave a long half-life (>\n\u223c picoseconds) as first suggested by\nGrigorenko et al. [27].\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the\nNSCL operations staff for providing a high quality beam\nand D. Sayre for taking night shifts during the experiment.

The solid line corresponds to the results of a simulation assuming a hypothetical 870 keV state in 26 O decaying sequentially via the ground state of 25 O. The dashed and\ndot-dashed lines are the contributions due to real two-neutron\ncoincidences and double-hits from one neutron, respectively.\n\n[1] S.C. Pieper and R.B. Wiringa, Annu. Rev. Nucl.
