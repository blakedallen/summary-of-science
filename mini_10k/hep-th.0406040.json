This observation\nis useful to better understand holographic properties of these non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLooking for exact solutions of Einstein's field equations with/without matter source is a subject of long standing\ninterest. Recent years have seen a lot of activity to find and study asymptotically anti de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter\n(dS) solutions. For the asymptotically AdS spaces, there are at least two reasons responsible for this. The first is\nrelated to the so-called AdS-CFT (conformal field theory) correspondence [1], which states that string/M theory on\nan AdS space times a compact manifold is dual to a strong coupling conformal field theory residing on the boundary\nof the AdS space. The radial spatial coordinate in asymptotically AdS spaces can be viewed as the energy scale in\nrenormalization group flow of dual field theory. It has been argued by Witten [2] that the thermodynamics of black\nhole in AdS space can be identified with that of a certain dual CFT in the high temperature limit. For instance, the\nHawking-Page phase transition [3] of black holes in AdS space is identified with the confinement/unconfinement phase\ntransition of CFT's. Therefore, one can gain some insights into the thermodynamic properties and phase structures\nof some strong coupling CFT's by investigating the thermodynamics of AdS black holes.\nThe other is related to the topology structure of black hole in AdS space. Before the discovery of the AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence, it was already recognized that in an asymptotically AdS space, except for the black hole with event\nhorizon being a positive constant curvature sphere, it is also possible to have black holes whose event horizon could be\na negative constant or zero curvature hypersurface. These black hole solutions are often referred to as topological black\nholes in the literature [4]. Various properties associated with these topological black holes have been investigated in\nrecent years. For example, their higher dimensional [5] and charged [6] generalizations and formation via gravitational\ncollapse [7] have been studied. Topological black hole solutions in Lovelock gravity and associated thermodynamics\nhave also been discussed [8]. Even some perturbative solutions in higher derivative gravity have been found and\ninvestigated in [9]. In particular, topological black holes in gauged supergravities with nontrivial scalar fields have\nbeen also discovered in [10].\nIn a D-dimensional Hilbert-Einstein action with a negative cosmological constant, \u039b = \u2212(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)/2l2,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)\nS=\n,\n(1.1)\ndD x \u2212g R +\n16\u03c0GD\nl2\nwhere GD is the Newton gravitational constant in D dimensions, one has a neutral AdS black hole solution with the\nmetric\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 d\u03a32D\u22122,k ,\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail address: cairg@itp.ac.cn; Rong-Gen Cai@baylor.edu\ne-mail: Anzhong Wang@baylor.edu\n\n(1.2)\n\n\f2\nwhere\nf (r) = k \u2212\n\n16\u03c0GD M\nr2\n+\n,\n(D \u2212 2)V ol(\u03a3)rD\u22123\nl2\n\n(1.3)\n\nM is the mass of the black hole, and d\u03a32D\u22122,k represents the line element of a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional hypersurface\nwith constant curvature (D \u2212 2)(D \u2212 3)k and volume V ol(\u03a3). Without loss of generality, the characteristic curvature\nconstant k can be taken \u00b11 or 0. When k = 1, the hypersurface \u03a3 could be a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional round sphere\nS D\u22122 , while k = 0, \u03a3 could be a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional torus T D\u22122 . When k = \u22121, the hypersurface \u03a3 is a negative\nconstant curvature space. In this case, one can obtain a closed hyperbolic hypersurface H D\u22122 with high genus through\nappropriate identification. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the thermodynamics of black hole (1.1) can be viewed\nas that of the dual CFT residing on the boundary of the AdS space, whose metric is, up to a conformal factor,\nds2CFT = \u2212dt2 + l2 d\u03a32D\u22122,k . In a word, the event horizon of the black hole (1.1) can have the topology S D\u22122 , T D\u22122 , or\nH D\u22122 , respectively, and the dual CFT resides on a (D \u2212 1)-dimensional spacetime with topology R\u00d7 S D\u22122 , R\u00d7 T D\u22122 ,\nor R \u00d7 H D\u22122 , respectively.\nFor the dS space, similar to the AdS-CFT correspondence, Strominger [11] has argued that there is also a dS-CFT\ncorrespondence: quantum gravity on a dS space can be dual to a Euclidean CFT residing on the boundary of the\ndS space. The time coordinate in asymptotically dS spaces can be regarded as the energy scale of renormalization\ngroup flow for dual Euclidean field theory [12, 13]. Replacing l2 by \u2212l2 and M by \u2212M in (1.3), the resulting solution\nis named as the topological dS solution in [14]. In that case, black hole horizon disappears, instead a cosmological\nhorizon occurs with a cosmological singularity at r = 0. The implication of such asymptotically dS solutions to the\nso-called mass bound conjecture in dS space [13] has been investigated in [14].\nOn the one hand, it is certainly of interest to find new, nontrivial solutions to the equations of motion of the action\n(1.1). On the other hand, let us note that various actions of gauged supergravities under consistent truncation, include\nscalar fields with potentials of exponential form (Liouville-type). Sometimes the action also includes Maxwell fields.\nIn a simpler form, the action could be written down as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\nS=\n(1.4)\ndD x \u2212g R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 2\u039b0 ea\u03c6 \u2212 e\u2212b\u03c6 F22 ,\n16\u03c0GD\n2\n4\nwhere a, b, and \u039b0 are constants and F2 denotes the Maxwell field. Usually people are interested in the asymptotically\nflat/AdS/dS solutions. However, it turns out difficult (might be impossible) to find such solutions in (1.4) with a set\nof general parameters. Indeed, in the literature, for example, see Refs. [15]-[23], some exact solutions of the action\n(1.4) have been found in some special cases. These solution are asymptotically neither AdS nor dS, different from\nthose (1.2) which are asymptotically AdS or dS. We have studied some aspects [14, 22, 23] of dual field theory to\nthese gravity solutions in the spirit of holography, as the non-conformal generalizations of AdS-CFT correspondence\nand dS-CFT correspondence.\nNote that an action like (1.4) can also be obtained by dimensionally reducing Einstein-Maxwell theory with a\ncosmological constant to a lower dimension. It is certainly worth discussing the relationship between those nonasymptotically AdS/dS solutions of the action (1.4) and asymptotically AdS/dS solutions (1.2), in order to better\nunderstand the holographic properties of those non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions. This is one of the main aims of\nthe present paper [30]. On the other hand, we will look for and analyze in some details, exact solutions in an action\nlike (1.4) with one or two Liouville-type potentials, without any assumption on the relations among the parameters\nin the theory, which generalizes existing solutions in the literature in various directions.\nThe organization of the present paper is as follows. In the next section, we first discuss the case where resulting\naction comes from a higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant and the reduced\nsubspace is Ricci flat. In this case, the resulting action is of the form (1.4). In Sec. III, we investigate the case where\nthe reduced subspace is a nonzero constant curvature space, where resulting action has two Liouville-type potentials.\nThe conclusions and some discussions are presented in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nDIMENSIONAL REDUCTION: RICCI FLAT CASE\nA.\n\nNeutral solution\n\nIn this subsection, we first discuss the case without the Maxwell field. Let us start with a (D + d)-dimensional\nHilbert-Einstein action with a cosmological constant \u039b0 ,\nZ\np\n1\nS=\ndD+d x \u2212g\u0303(R\u0303 \u2212 2\u039b0 ),\n(2.1)\n16\u03c0G\n\n\f3\nwhere G is the Newton gravitational constant in D + d dimensions, g\u0303 and R\u0303 denote the (D + d)-dimensional metric\ndeterminant and curvature scalar, respectively. Consider the (D + d)-dimensional metric line element having the\nfollowing form\nds2D+d = e2\u03b1(x) ds2D + e2\u03b2(x) ds2d ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere ds2d = qij dy i dy j denotes a d-dimensional constant curvature space with scalar curvature d(d \u2212 1)kd . In this\nsection, we consider the case kd = 0. Namely, qij = \u03b4ij , and then ds2d is a d-dimensional Euclidean flat space. In\naddition, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are two functions of coordinate x in the subspace described by ds2D . Making dimensional reduction\nalong y, and taking \u03b2 = (2 \u2212 D)\u03b1/d, we obtain an action from (2.1)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\n(D \u2212 2)(D + d \u2212 2)\nVq\n(2.3)\n(\u2202\u03b1)2 \u2212 2\u039b0 e2\u03b1 ,\ndD x \u2212g R \u2212\nS=\n16\u03c0G\nd\nwhere Vq is the volume of the subspace described by ds2d and R is the curvature scalar of line element ds2D .

The solution (2.15) has a singularity at r = 0 only. From (2.14) and\n(2.16), one can see that 0 < N < 1. When a = 0, one has N = 1 and the \u03c6 is then a constant. In this case, the action\n(2.5) reduces to (1.1) and the solution (2.15) becomes (1.2) with k = 0.\nWe are of course interested in the case of a 6= 0 and \u039b0 < 0. In this case, the dilaton potential in (2.5) could be\nviewed as a negative effective cosmological constant. (i) when 1/D < N < 1, the second term in (2.15) is positive\nand dominant as r \u2192 \u221e. The solution therefore describes a black hole, provided M > 0, with a conformal Ricci\nflat horizon r+ determined by A(r)|r=r+ = 0. Applying the quasilocal mass formulism of gravitational configurations\ndeveloped in [26] to our case and considering the solution with M = 0 as the reference background, the quasilocal\nmass of the black hole is found to be (see also [22])\nM=\n\n(D \u2212 2)N Vq Vh M\n.\n16\u03c0G\n\n(2.17)\n\nNote that here the effective Newton gravitational constant is G/Vq . Obviously, if M < 0, the singularity at r = 0\nbecomes naked. (ii) When 0 < N < 1/D, the second term is negative and the first term in (2.15) is dominant as\nr \u2192 \u221e. In this case, the solution has a black hole horizon r+ provided M < 0 (which implies that the gravitational\nmass of the black hole is negative). The horizon is also determined by A(r)|r=r+ = 0 and is a conformal Ricci flat\nhypersurface. When M > 0, the singularity at r = 0 becomes naked, again.\nFor completeness, we also analyze the case of \u039b0 > 0 here. In this case, the dilaton potential in (2.5) can be\nregarded as a positive effective cosmological constant. (i) When 1/D < N < 1, the second term in (2.15) is always\nnegative and dominant as r \u2192 \u221e, therefore there is a cosmological horizon provided M < 0. The solution describes\na cosmological solution with a conformal Ricci flat cosmological horizon rc determined by A(r)|r=rc = 0, and the\nsingularity at r = 0 is a cosmological singularity.

When M > 0, the solution describes a naked singularity spacetime. This solution was first found\nin [14] and the implication of the solution in the sense of dS/CFT correspondence was discussed there. (ii) When\n0 < N < 1/D, the second term is always positive and the first term is dominant as r \u2192 \u221e. The solution has a\ncosmological horizon if M > 0, otherwise describes a naked singularity. The property of the solution is summarized\nin Tab.

Now let us observe an interesting consequence if the parameter a in (2.15) has a relation\n\n\f5\n(2.6). In this case, one has N = (D + d \u2212 2)/(D + 2d \u2212 2), which obeys 1/2 < N < 1. We can uplift the D-dimensional,\nnon-asymptotically AdS/dS solution (2.15) to the one (2.2) in (D + d) dimensions and obtain\n\u0001\nds2D+d = ea\u03c60 r\u22122d/(D+2d\u22122) \u2212Adt2 + A\u22121 dr2 +r2(D\u22122)/(D+2d\u22122) (ea\u03c60 \u03b4mn dxm dxn +e\u2212(D\u22122)a\u03c60 /d \u03b4ij dy i dy j ). (2.19)\nRedefining r(D\u22122)/(D+2d\u22122) \u2192 r and rescaling coordinates and the integration constant M, we find that the solution\n(2.19) can be rewritten as\nds2D+d = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 (\u03b4mn dxm dxn + \u03b4ij dy i dy j ),\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith\nf (r) = \u2212\n\nM\n\nrD+d\u22123\n\n\u2212\n\n2\u039b0 r2\n.\n(D + d \u2212 1)(D + d \u2212 2)\n\nThis is nothing but the AdS black hole solution (1.2) with k = 0 in (D + d) dimensions if \u039b0 < 0 and M > 0. On the\nother hand, if \u039b0 > 0 and M < 0, the solution is a topological dS solution with k = 0 in (1.3). Clearly the solution\n(2.20) is asymptotically AdS/dS. Therefore some of non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions (2.15) can be understood as\nthe dimensional reduction of a higher dimensional, asymptotically AdS/dS solution (2.20). Certainly this observation\nis useful to understand the holography of the non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions (2.15).\nWhen k 6= 0, the solution of (2.7) is found to be\nA(r) = \u2212\n\nM\n\n+\n\n(D \u2212 3)kr2\u22122N\n,\n(2N \u2212 1)(N (D \u2212 4) + 1)\n\nr(D\u22122)N \u22121\np\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 \u2212 2N (1 \u2212 N )(D \u2212 2) ln r, R = rN ,\na2 (D \u2212 2)\n,\nN=\n2 + a2 (D \u2212 2)\n(D \u2212 3)(D \u2212 2)(1 \u2212 N )ke\u2212a\u03c60\n2\u039b0 = \u2212\n.\n2N \u2212 1\n\n(2.21)\n\n(2.22)\n\nIt might be worth noticing that this set of solution with k 6= 0 does not reduce to the one (2.15) and (2.16) when\nk \u2192 0. This is caused that in the process of solving the equations (2.9)-(2.12), by use of R = rN and \u03c6 given by\n(2.14), we can obtain a general solution of A through (2.12). In order the equation (2.11) to hold, we have to have\ntwo constraints if k 6= 0, which result in N and \u039b0 in (2.22). If k = 0, there is only one constraint, giving us N in\n(2.16). Therefore within the ansatz of R = rN , the solutions of k = 0 and k 6= 0 belong to different branches. In\naddition, note that due to 0 < N < 1, the second term in (2.21) therefore is always dominant as r \u2192 \u221e.\n(2). When k = 1, one can see from (2.22) that the cosmological constant \u039b0 is negative as 1/2 < N < 1. In this\ncase, the solution (2.21) describes a black hole with mass (2.17) provided M > 0, whose horizon is determined by\nA(r)|r=r+ = 0, and the horizon is a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional, positive constant curvature hypersurface. If M < 0, it is\na naked singularity solution. When 0 < N < 1/2, the cosmological constant has to be positive. In that case, the\nsolution has a cosmological horizon determined by A(r)|r=rc = 0 provided M < 0. Otherwise, it is a naked singularity\nsolution. The gravitational mass is given by (2.18). This solution generalizes the topological dS solutions in [14]. The\nproperties of the solution are summarized in Tab.

In that\ncase, one has N = d/(D + 2d \u2212 2) < 1/2. Namely we have to take a positive cosmological constant \u039b0 in (2.22).

If M < 0, this solution is nothing but a (d + 2)-dimensional topological dS solution with\na conformal Ricci flat cosmological horizon times a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional compact space with a positive constant\ncurvature 2(D \u2212 2)\u039b0 /(D + d \u2212 2). It is easy to check that the solution (2.24) satisfies the (D + d)-dimensional\nEinstein's field equations with a positive cosmological constant \u039b0 .\n(3). When k = \u22121, one can see from (2.22) that the cosmological constant is positive if 1/2 < N < 1. In this case,\nthe second term is negative and the solution (2.21) has a cosmological horizon which is a negative constant curvature\nhypersurface provided M < 0. The gravitational mass is given by (2.18). The solution generalizes the one in [14] to\nthe case k = \u22121. If M > 0, the solution describes a naked singularity. On the other hand, when 0 < N < 1/2, the\ncosmological constant has to be negative. In this case, the second term in (2.21) is positive and the solution describes\na black hole with a negative constant curvature horizon provided M > 0. The black hole mass is given by (2.17). If\nM < 0, the singularity at r = 0 becomes naked. The causal structure of the solution is summarized in Tab. II.\nWhen a takes the value of (2.6), we have N = d/(D + 2d \u2212 2) < 1/2. Namely, in this case, one has to have a\nnegative cosmological constant. One can uplift the solution to (D + d) dimensions. As the case of k = 1, we find that\nthe (D + d)-dimensional solution can be rewritten as\nds2D+d = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 \u03b4ij dy i dy j + B 2 hmn dxm dxn ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhere\nf (r) = \u2212\n\nM\n2|\u039b0 |r2\n+\n,\nrd\u22121\n(d + 1)(D + d \u2212 2)\n\nB2 =\n\n(D \u2212 3)(D + d \u2212 2)\n.\n2|\u039b0 |\n\nNote that here hmn dxm dxn denotes a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional negative constant curvature space with scalar curvature\n\u2212(D \u2212 2)(D \u2212 3). It is easy to see that the solution (2.25) describes a (d + 2)-dimensional AdS black hole with a\nconformal Ricci flat horizon times a (D \u2212 2)-dimensional negative constant curvature space.

The behavior of the solution depends on the\ncharacteristic curvature k. The properties of the solution are summarized in Tab. IV.\nWhen k = 1, the causal structure is as follows. (i) When 0 < N < 1/2, the cosmological constant is positive;\nthe second term is negative. Therefore there will be a cosmological horizon regardless of the sign of the mass\nparameter M. (ii) When 1/2 < N < 1, the cosmological constant has to be negative. In that case, black hole\nhorizon appears when M > 0. The mass of black hole mass is given by (2.17). If M < 0, the singularity at r = 0\nbecomes naked. In this case, the black hole (cosmological) horizon is a positive constant curvature hypersurface.\nWhen k = \u22121, the solution describes a black hole if 0 < N < 1/2 and M > 0. On the other hand, in the case of\n1/2 < N < 1, the cosmological constant is positive and the second term is always negative. Therefore there is a\ncosmological horizon. Here the black hole (cosmological) horizon is a negative constant curvature hypersurface.\nThis solution cannot be uplifted to (D + d) dimensions according to (2.2) unless Q = 0 or \u039b0 = 0. The case\nof Q = 0 results in the higher dimensional solution (2.24) or (2.25) with D = 4, while the higher dimensional\nsolution is included in (2.41) as a special case when \u039b0 = 0.\nTABLE IV: The property of the solution (2.34) for different parameters.\nk\n1\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\nN\n0 < N < 1/2 1/2 < N < 1 0 < N < 1/2 1/2 < N < 1\n\u039b0\n>0\n<0\n<0\n>0\nSolution\nCH\nBH (M > 0) BH (M > 0)\nCH\n\n\u2022 Solution 2.\nA=\u2212\n\nM\n\n\u2212\n\n\u039b0 ea\u03c60\nk\nr2N + 2N \u22122 ,\nN (4N \u2212 1)\nr\n\nr2N \u22121\np\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 \u2212 4N (1 \u2212 N ) ln r, R = rN ,\nNa\n1\n1\n, b=\n= ,\nN=\n1 + a2\n1\u2212N\na\nQ2 = 4(1 \u2212 N )keb\u03c60 ,\nFmn = Q\u01ebmn .\n\n(2.36)\n\n(2.37)\n\nThis solution is interesting. It follows from (2.37) that k > 0 since Q2 > 0. From the expression (2.36), we can\nsee that the third term in (2.36) is dominant as 0 < N < 1/2, while the domination term is the second term\nif 1/2 < N < 1 as r \u2192 \u221e. (i) When 0 < N < 1/4, the solution always describes a black hole in spite of the\nsign of the parameter M if \u039b0 < 0; if \u039b0 > 0, one has to have M > 0 in order to have a black hole horizon.\nIn other cases the solution describes a naked singularity. (ii) When 1/4 < N < 1/2, the solution also describes\na black hole in spite of the sign of M if \u039b0 > 0. However, if \u039b0 < 0, the mass parameter has to be positive,\nM > 0. (iii) When 1/2 < N < 1, the solution has a cosmological horizon if \u039b0 > 0 in spite of the sign of M; if\n\u039b0 < 0, it is a black hole solution provided M > 0. In other cases, the singularity at r = 0 is naked. The result\nis summarized in Tab. V. The solution (2.36) cannot be uplifted to a higher dimension according to (2.2) unless\nQ = 0 or \u039b0 = 0.

As r \u2192 \u221e, the second term in (3.8) is dominant if 0 < N < 1/2, while\nthe third term does if 1/2 < N < 1. (i) In the range 0 < N < 1/D, the cosmological constant \u039b0 must be\npositive. In this case, the solution must have a cosmological horizon if \u039b1 > 0, regardless of the sign of the mass\nparameter; on the other hand, in order to have a cosmological horizon, the mass parameter must be negative if\n\u039b1 < 0. (ii) In the range 1/D < N < 1/2, if \u039b1 < 0, the solution has a cosmological horizon regardless of the\nsign of M; to have a cosmological horizon, M must be negative if \u039b1 > 0. (iii) If 1/2 < N < 1, the cosmological\nconstant \u039b0 is negative. When \u039b1 > 0 the solution has a cosmological horizon regardless of the sign of M, while\nblack hole horizon appears provided M > 0 when \u039b1 < 0. In other cases, the singularity at r = 0 is naked. The\nresult is summarized in Tab. X. This solution cannot be uplifted to (D + d) dimensions according to (2.2) unless\n\u039b0 = 0 or \u039b1 = 0. For the latter, the resulting solution is (2.24). For the case of \u039b0 = 0, the higher dimensional\nsolution turns out to be (3.7).\nTABLE X: The property of the solution 1 in (3.8) for different parameters in the case of k = 1.\nN\n0 < N < 1/D 0 < N < 1/D 1/D < N < 1/2 1/D < N < 1/2 1/2 < N < 1 1/2 < N < 1\n\u039b0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n>0\n<0\n<0\n\u039b1\n>0\n<0\n>0\n<0\n>0\n<0\nSolution\nCH\nCH (M < 0)\nCH\nCH(M < 0)\nCH\nBH (M > 0)\n\nWhen k = \u22121, the cosmological constant \u039b0 is negative in the range 0 < N < 1/2, while it is positive in the\nrange 1/2 < N < 1. (i) In the range 0 < N < 1/D, a black hole horizon always appears if \u039b1 < 0 regardless\nof the sign of M. If \u039b1 > 0, one has to have M > 0 in order to have a black hole horizon. (ii) In the range\n\n\f14\nof 1/D < N < 1/2, the solution always has a black hole horizon if \u039b1 > 0, otherwise the mass parameter must\nbe positive if \u039b1 < 0 in order to have a black hole horizon.

The\nproperty of the solution (3.8) is summarized in Tab. XI in the case of k = \u22121. Once again, because the relation\nbetween a and c in the solution (3.8) does not satisfy the one in (3.3), one cannot uplift the solution to higher\ndimensional case according to (2.2) unless \u039b0 = 0 or \u039b1 = 0.

In addition, due to c = a, we also cannot uplift the solution to D + d dimensions according\nto (2.2) unless \u039b1 = 0 or \u039b0 = 0. For the former, resulting solution is given by (2.24) or (2.25) depending on\nthe sign of \u039b0 .

But the expressions of solutions and analysis are rather complicated and we\nshall not present them here.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nBy dimensionally reducing an Einstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant to a lower dimension, we\ncan obtain an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with one or two dilaton potentials of Liouville-type. We have looked\nfor and analyzed in some details exact (neutral/magnetic/electric charged) solutions of these theories. These found\nsolutions have a rich structure depending on the parameters in the theory. These solutions could have black hole\nhorizon(s), cosmological horizon, or a naked singularity. These horizons can be a positive, zero or negative constant\ncurvature hypersurface. In particular, we noted that some black hole solutions have negative gravitational mass. In\naddition these solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor asymptotically AdS/dS. Our study generalized existing\nresults concerning non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions in the literature in some directions. For example, (1) in our\ndiscussions, spacetime dimensions D and d are almost arbitrary; (2) black hole horizon(s) or cosmological horizon\ncan be a hypersurface with positive, zero or negative constant curvature; (3) the scalar potential could be one or\ntwo Liouville-type term(s). Here it would be worth mentioning some of existing literatures about non-asymptotically\nAdS/dS solutions: the authors of [15] looked for solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with dilaton potential,\nbut it is restricted to the case k = 1; Chan in [16] discussed the modification of three dimensional BTZ black hole by a\nscalar potential; the authors of [17, 18] studied four dimensional topological dilaton black hole solutions with k = 0 or\n\u22121. Klemm in [19] found supersymmetric solution in the four dimensional gauged N = 4, SU (2)\u00d7SU (2) supergarvity;\nRefs. [14, 20, 22, 23] investigated domain wall solutions with k = 0 in Einstein-dilaton theory with a Liouville-type\npotential; Cvetic et al in [21] found apdomain wall solution with k = 0 in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with\nspecial coupling parameters a = b = 2/p in (2.27); for more recent discussions on the non-asymptotically AdS/dS\nsolutions with k = 1 in four dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory without dilaton potential see [24, 25]; other\nrelated discussions see [28].\nSince the action that we worked with could come from the dimensional reduction from a higher dimensional\nEinstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant, some of the found solutions can be uplifted to the case of\nhigher dimensions. We found that some of these neither asymptotically flat nor AdS/dS solutions have a higher\ndimensional origin; and their higher dimensional origins have well-behaved asymptotics: they are either asymptotically\nAdS/dS [see, for example, (2.20), (2.24), (2.25) and (2.41)], or asymptotically flat (see, for example, (3.7) and (3.14)]\nwith/without a compact constant curvature space. From the point of view of holography, this observation is useful\nto better understand the holographic properties of these non-asymptotically AdS/dS solutions.\nThe black hole horizon and cosmological horizon of these solutions have usual thermodynamical relations. For\nexample, the Hawking temperature of horizon is given by\nT =\n\n1 \u2032\n|A (r)|r=r+ ,rc ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere r+ and rc denote black hole horizon and cosmological horizon, respectively. The horizon entropy is still by the\nso-called area formula\nS=\n\nVq Vh\nA,\n4G\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere A = r(D\u22122)N |r=r+ ,rc , since we have worked in the Einstein frame, where the area formula of black hole entropy\nholds. With the black hole mass given by (2.17) or the gravitational mass (2.18) for the cosmological horizon, it is\neasy to show that the first law of thermodynamics holds for both black hole horizon and cosmological horizon\ndM = T dS + \u03a6dQ,\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f16\nwhere Q is the electric charge or magnetic charge of the solutions, and \u03a6 is the corresponding chemical potential. As\nan example, let us consider the electric charged solution given by (2.43) and (2.44). In terms of black hole horizon\nradius r+ determined by the equation A(r)|r=r+ = 0, the black hole mass is given by\n!\n(D\u22122)N \u22121\n2N\nVq Vh r+\n2\u039b0ea\u03c60 r+\nQ2 eb\u03c60\nM=\n\u2212\n.\n(4.4)\n+\n2(D\u22123)N\n16\u03c0G\nND \u2212 1\n2((D \u2212 4)N + 1)r+\nThe Hawking temperature T and the entropy are\n1\nT =\n4\u03c0N (D \u2212 2)r+\nS=\n\n2N\n\u22122\u039b0 ea\u03c60 r+\n\n\u2212\n\nQ2 eb\u03c60\n\n2(D\u22123)N\n\n2r+\n\nVq Vh (D\u22122)N\nr\n,\n4G +\n\n!\n\n;\n(4.5)\n\nrespectively. Note that in order to have a black hole horizon, the constant \u039b0 has to be negative here so that the\ntemperature is always positive definiteness. When T = 0, it indicates that the black hole is an extremal black hole\nwith vanishing Hawking temperature. The electric charge associated with the black hole is\nQ=\n\nVh\nQ.\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.6)\n\nAnd the conjugate chemical potential \u03a6\n\u03a6=\n\nVq Qeb\u03c60\n\n(D\u22124)N +1\n\n4G((D \u2212 4)N + 1)r+\n\n.\n\n(4.7)\n\nThese thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics (4.3). Indeed, as was shown\nby Wald [29], the first law of black hole mechanics always holds for any stationary black hole spacetime in any\ngravitational theory.\nFinally we point out that the solutions we found are not well-defined for some special values of N , for example,\nN = 1/D for the solution (2.15), (2.43), (2.49), and (3.6); N = 1/2 for (2.21), (2.32), (2.40), (2.45), (2.47),(2.51),\n(3.8), (3.10) and (3.12); and N = 1/4 for (2.30) and (2.36). In fact for these special values, we can also find solutions,\nbut a term concerning the logarithmic function of r will appear in the metric function A. Here we do not present\nthose solutions, although the concerned discussions are straightforward.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank G. Clement for a carefully reading.

The authors find that a four dimensional\nnon-asymptotically flat black hole solution derived by Chan et al. [15] of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory (1.4) without\nthe dilaton potential\nterm can be reobtained by\u221ataking a near horizon limit of asymptotically flat black hole solution, and\n\u221a\nthat when b = 6 (in the notation of [24], \u03b1 = 3), the four dimensional non-asymptotically flat, magnetic charged black\nhole can be understood as a dimensional reduction of a five dimensional, asymptotically flat Schwarzschild black hole along\none of the azimuthal angles.\n\n\f"}
