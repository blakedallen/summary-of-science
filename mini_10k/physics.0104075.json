Such systems are used to perform experimental tests of fundamental principles and have important applications, such as very precise frequency\nstandards or studies of cold atomic collisions or collective effects. Fluctuations\nof the electromagnetic fields used to trap or to modify the quantum state lead\nto decoherence in ion traps [1] and limit the trap stability in, e. g., far\u2013of\u2013\nresonance optical traps [2]. As a consequence, there has been, in recent years,\nan increasing interest in understanding the dynamics of noise-induced heating\nin atom traps.\nIn the harmonic model of the potential, fluctuations manifest themselves as\neither variations on the spring constant or on the equilibrium position. First\norder perturbative studies [2, 3] of harmonic parametric heating yield similar\nresults to those classically expected: position noise is resonant at the vibrational\nfrequency \u03c90 leading to a constant heating rate, while intensity fluctuations\nare resonant at twice the vibrational frequency 2\u03c90 leading to an exponential\ngrowth of the energy. Far-off-resonance optical traps are so sensitive to these\nfluctuations that parametric excitation has been used to accurately measure the\ntrap parameters [4, 5, 6].\nThere are other interesting phenomena predicted by the classical theory of\nharmonic parametric excitation such as resonance effects at fractional frequencies [7]. They arise from intensity modulations of frequency 2\u03c90 /n with n being\nany integer number. The n = 2 resonance has actually been observed in FORT's\n[4, 5, 6] and resonances with n \u2264 10 have been classically studied in ion traps\n[8].\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the quantum description of parametric heating in harmonic potentials both nonperturbatively and perturbatively.\nThe first treatment shows an explicit connection with the classical problem\nwhich is valid only for harmonic potentials. It is based on well known algebraic\ntechniques [9].It explains observed features of parametric heating predicted both\nclassically and quantum mechanically. The second approach has the advantage\nthat it can be directly extended to anharmonic potentials. This is specially\nimportant for shallow traps.\n\n2\n\nNonperturbative treatment of harmonic parametric heating\n\n2\n\n\f2.1\n\nTime dependent equilibrium position\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian that describes a harmonic oscillator with fluctuations\nin the trap equilibrium position is\nH=\n\np2\n1\n+ M \u03c902 (q + \u01ebq (t))2\n2m 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01ebq (t) measures such a fluctuation.

It is well known [12, 13] that\ndepending on the values of \u03b1 and q, the solutions hk are stable or unstable.\nIn the context of parametric heating the transition curves separating regions of\nstability and instability define the width of the corresponding resonance. For\nq << \u03b1 the resonances are located at \u03b1 \u223c n2 , i. e., \u03c9 = 2\u03c90 /n. Their width\ncan be found as a power series in \u01eb0 using, e. g., equations 20.2.25 of Ref.

We observe\nthat for \u03c9t \u2264 1 the transition probability exhibits an approximately polynomial\ngrowth. However, for longer times an oscillatory behavior arises. In Fig. (2),\nwe illustrate the energy evolution starting from vacuum state; we take the same\nvalues for the parameters \u03c9 and \u01eb0 . An exponential growth superposed to the\noscillatory behavior of function \u03c6(t), in Eq. (33), is found. The similarities between Fig. (1b) and Fig. (2) are due to the fact that the main source of heating\nfrom vacuum state are precisely the transitions |0i \u2192 |2i. These graphs have\nbeen obtained using a numerical solution of the Mathieu equation.\n\n3\n\nPerturbative approach to parametric heating.\n\nThe nonperturbative approach to parametric heating made in the last section\nwas useful to understand the connection between classical and quantum de7\n\n\fscriptions of heating, due to either controlled or stochastic variations of the\nparameters defining a harmonic oscillator. Unfortunately, this approach is valid\nonly for quadratic potentials while nonlinear effects may be determinant in experiments with shallow confining potentials [8, 14]. The purpose of this section\nis to study some high order perturbative effects due to variations on the strength\nof a confining potential. The resulting equations will be applied to a harmonic\noscillator but with a straightforward extension to anharmonic potentials. Besides, this will allow us to understand fractional frequency resonances from an\nalternative point of view.\nThe system is described by a Hamiltonian\nH=\n\np2\n+ V (x)(1 + \u01ebv (t))\n2m\n\n\u01ebv (t) << 1.\n\n(35)\n\nFollowing standard time dependent perturbation theory we define the unperturbed Hamiltonian\np2\nH0 =\n+ V (x)\n(36)\n2m\nand work in the interaction picture in which the equation of motion of the state\nis\nd|\u03a8\u0303(t)i\n= \u01ebv (t)\u1e7c (x, t)|\u03a8\u0303(t)i.\n(37)\nih\u0304\ndt\nThe transformed state |\u03a8\u0303(t)i in the interaction picture is obtained from the\nSchr\u00f6dinger picture state vector by a time-dependent unitary operator\n|\u03a8\u0303(t)i = eiH0 t/h\u0304 |\u03a8(t)i,\n\n(38)\n\nwhile the interaction operator \u1e7c (x) is given by\n\u1e7c (x, t) = eiH0 t/h\u0304 V (x)e\u2212iH0 t/h\u0304 .\nIn this picture the evolution operator satisfies the integral equation\nZ\ni t\n\u01ebv (t)\u1e7c (x, t)\u0168 (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 .\n\u0168 (t) = 1 \u2212\nh\u0304 0\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\nLet us consider the transition probability amplitude hk|U (t)|si between given\neigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian\nH0 |ni = En |ni.\n\n(41)\n\nAn iterative treatment of Eq.

In such\na limit the transition probability rates Rs\u2190k are constant.\nNow, some of the general behavior of higher order corrections can be inferred.\nThus, the dominant transition probability of a fractional frequency resonance\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c90 /n arises at n-order perturbation theory. It can be interpreted as an\nn-step procedure consisting on n-virtual transitions , where n \u2212 1 of them do\nnot change the state and one changes it. Thus, we expect the expression (48) to\ndescribe approximately the transition probabilities k \u2192 k \u00b1 2 when the source\nhas a frequency \u03c9 = \u03c90 . This can be verified by comparing with the exact\nresults of last section.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and Outlook.\n\nIn this work, we have performed a perturbative and a nonperturbative analysis\nof quantum parametric oscillators. The first approach is based on standard algebraic techniques and gives a direct connection between classical and quantum\nresults. In the case of controlled driving terms of the form \u01eb(t) = \u01eb0 cos \u03c9t,\nthe analytic solutions were used to evaluate time-dependent observables such as\nthe energy growth due to parametric heating. This is specially important for\nfar\u2013off\u2013resonance\u2013traps (FORT's) when the harmonic oscillator approximation\nis valid. In that case, parametric heating is used as a technique to measure\nthe characteristic frequency of the trap. In such experiments, the fractional\nfrequency resonances are usually observed and it is clear, within our formalism, how to perform their quantum description. In particular, using well known\nresults of the theory of Mathieu functions, it was shown how to evaluate the fractional resonances width and how obtain explicit expressions for the exponential\ngrowth of the energy.\nThe possibility of using the nonperturbative analysis to describe noise heating effects is a subject that deserves more analysis. This idea has recently been\nexploited [10] in the case of fluctuations in the trap center. In the case of intensity fluctuations, the problem is more complicated since a rigorous description\nwould require to study the correlation functions of the classical solutions {h1 , h2 }\nand their derivatives {\u1e231 , \u1e232 } as they appear in the expressions for the time evolution of a given physical quantity. For instance, to study the time-evolution\n\n10\n\n\fof the energy, it would be necessary to evaluate the classical correlation functions |M2 |2 and M1 M2 . These correlation functions would depend on the noise\ncorrelations.\nAn alternative would correspond to use solutions {h1 , h2 } of classical equations describing in an effective way the coupling between the harmonic oscillator\nand the fluctuating fields. The usefulness of such an approach would be conditioned by its ability to reproduce experimental effects. For instance, classical\nharmonic oscillators with an intensity variation \u01eb(t) = \u01eb0 cos \u03c9 \u2032 t and subject to\na damping force \u2212\u03b3 \u1e8b lead to fractional frequency resonances only if \u01eb0 is greater\nthan a certain threshold which depends on \u03b3 and the order of the resonance.\nSuch thresholds have been observed in the classical collective motion of ions in\nPaul traps [8]. It would be expected that a similar phenomena occurs in the\nquantum regime of motion. The experimental study of these thresholds could\nbe used to evaluate effective damping effects in atom traps.\nIn this paper, the perturbative analysis of heating induced by variations of\nthe intensity of a potential was studied in detail for a harmonic oscillator. This\nanalysis gave a different insight into the problem. Fractional frequencies of order\nn appear in n-th order perturbation theory. From the quantum theory point of\nview, they are a direct consequence of: (i)the fact that the harmonic potential\nhas diagonal matrix elements hk|V |ki different from zero; (ii) the equidistant\nspectrum of the harmonic oscillator.\nThe extension of the perturbative analysis to other confining potentials\nis straightforward. In fact, this approach has already been implemented for\nFORT's with shallow potentials [14].\nWe thank S. Hacyan, P. Nicola and G. Modugno for stimulating discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. J.

The short time\nbehavior is shown in Fig 1a.\nFigure 2.\nNonperturbative evolution of the energy of a time dependent harmonic oscillator of natural frequency \u03c90 in units of h\u0304\u03c90 . The system is initially in the\nvacuum state and the intensity time dependence is given by \u01eb(t) = \u01eb0 cos \u03c9t,\n\u01eb0 = 0.05, \u03c9 = \u03c90 , so that the first fractional resonance condition is satisfied.\nSuperposed to the exponential growth, the oscillatory behavior of the function\n\u03c6(t) that appears in the Floquet solution to Mathieu equation is clearly manifested.\n\n12\n\n\f\u00bb < 0 \u00bb U \u00bb 2 > \u00bb2\n0.003\n\n\u00bb < 0 \u00bb U \u00bb 2 > \u00bb2\n0.0002\n0.000175\n0.00015\n0.000125\n0.0001\n0.000075\n0.00005\n0.000025\n0.2\n\n0.0025\n0.002\n0.0015\n0.001\n0.0005\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1 wt\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200 wt\n\n\fEnergy -w\n\n0.52\n\n0.515\n\n0.51\n\n0.505\n\nwt\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\f"}
