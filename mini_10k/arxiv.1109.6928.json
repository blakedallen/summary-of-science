Michael Barnett\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA\nThere are many varied programs of education and outreach in particle physics. This report for the Division of Particles and Fields of\nthe American Physical Society 2001 meeting reviews the impact of these programs in general, and also gives several examples of\nongoing programs with a primary focus on those in the US.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this talk, I discussed how the outside world views us, and what we can communicate that students and the public will\nappreciate and retain. Our goal should be to inspire and engage students and the public.\n\n2. A Sense of Wonder\nFormer President Bill Clinton, spoke at the World Economic Summit in Davos in January 2011. For most of the hour,\nthe moderator asked him about the past and present situation in the world. He then asked about the next 20 years, and\nClinton immediately turned to science, and in particular, the Large Hadron Collider. It is notable that science was the theme\nof his remarks about the future. While the details about the LHC were fuzzy, what he emphasized most was that we\nimpart a \"sense of wonder\". I believe that this is what we are most able to convey with our outreach efforts.\n\nFigure 1: Former President Bill Clinton speaking in Davos 2011\nA similar theme came from a new National Research Council study led by Helen Quinn. It proposed a new framework\nfor improving American science education. The report said that one of the big goals was to \"ensure that by the end of 12 th\ngrade, all students have some appreciation of the beauty and wonder of science\". The new framework calls for paring the\ncurriculum to focus on core ideas and teaching students more about how to approach and solve problems rather than just\nmemorizing factual nuggets.\n\n3. How does Hollywood Present Particle Physics?\nThere are many examples in literature, art and film of depictions of particle physics and/or particle physicists. In\naddition, we have feedback from Hollywood about our field. A recent example came from director and star of the major\nHollywood film Angels & Demons, Ron Howard and Tom Hanks, commenting on LHC. This can be seen in the extra\nfeature on the DVD of Angels & Demons. In addition, there are comments in:\nhttp://atlas.ch/angels/tom-hanks-clip.html and\nhttp://atlas.ch/angels/ron-howard-clip.html\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n2\n\nFigure 2: Ron Howard commenting on the LHC\nWhen Leon Lederman introduced the term \"God Particle\" for the Higgs boson in his book by that title, he could not have\nforeseen the impact in the media of this expression.\n\nFigure 3: Cover of Leon Lederman's book\nNot only has this expression appeared in innumerable news stories in newspapers and television, but also in movies such as\nAngels & Demons, where both antimatter and the God particle are discussed, see: http://www.atlas.ch/angels/godparticle.html\n\nFigure 4: Actress Ayelet Zurer explaining the God particle in Angels & Demons\n(TM and \u00a9 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.)\n\n4. Three Views of Accelerators and Collisions\nI think it is informative to look at three contrasting views of accelerators and collision events. The first is a recent\nexample from the New York Times.\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n3\n\nFigure 5: An illustration of accelerators from the New York Times\nThe Outreach program of the ATLAS Experiment produced an animation of the LHC and then a collision within\nATLAS, which can be seen at: http://www.atlas.ch/multimedia/actual-events.html\n\nFigure 6: A depiction of acceleration and collision produced by the ATLAS Experiment\nThe film Angels & Demons also produced a similar depiction, which can be seen in the DVD.\n\nFigure 7: A depiction of acceleration and collision in Angels & Demons\n(TM and \u00a9 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.)\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n4\n\n5. Science in Comics (and Animation of Comics)\nA very nice example of the use of comics to communicate science appears in the comic called PhD Comics. Some of\nthese are also animated, see an example about dark matter at: http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1430\n\nFigure 8: Example of a comic from PhD comics by Jorge Cham\n\n6. Unexpected Impacts\nThe impacts of our science can be unexpected. I have collected just a few examples. The opera Les Troyens by Berlioz,\nshown in Valencia, St. Peterburg and Warsaw, used a set design based on the ATLAS detector.\n\nFigure 9: A set design for Les Troyens based on the ATLAS detector (inset photo).\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n5\n\nThe forthcoming Muppets movie (due out in November 2011) apparently has a scene appearing to be taken in the\nATLAS cavern. This we only know from the trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4YhbpuGdwQ\n\nFigure 10: From the Muppets movie trailer on YouTube\n\nFor several years the charts produced by the Contemporary Physics Education Project (http:// CPEPphysics.org) have\nbeen appearing in movies and television. The movies include: Donnie Darko, Thirteen Conversations about One Thing,\nand Hulk. On television, the charts can be seen on Big Bang Theory.\n\nFigure 11: The charts of the Contemporary Physics Education Project\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n6\n\nPopular Science magazine recently had an article on the \"Universe's Ten Most Epic Projects\" and the Large Hadron\nCollider was number two.\n\nFigure 12: Article in Popular Science magazine\nI noted that following the EPS-2011 meeting, the 9th most popular article on BBC was the Higgs boson news, following\nthen headline news about attacks on students in Norway, debt talks in Washington, and coverage of the phone hacking\nscandal in Britain. More recently the neutrino speed story was the lead story on the Huffington Post website (on 23\nSeptember 2011).\n\nFigure 13: Huffington Post home page from 23 September 2011\n\n7. Education and Outreach Programs across HEP\nThis section is based on the talks (and slides) of the parallel session speakers. I am not reporting on the extensive\nprograms by ATLAS and CMS (see their websites for details): http://atlas.ch and http://cms.cern.ch\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n7.1.\n\nEducation at Fermilab\n\nMarge Bardeen of Fermilab reported on the extensive Education programs at Fermilab. These programs are a legacy of\nLeon Lederman. Leon began Saturday Morning Physics in 1980 to \"use the magnificence of Fermilab to dazzle (and\ncapture) high school kids.\"\n\nFigure 14: Leon Lederman talking to students.\n\n7.2.\n\nCMS eLab\n\nThe CMS e-Lab allows students to analyze data to calibrate the detector and participate in discovery science.\nCalibrating the detector to \"rediscover\" previous measured results is an important part of the early scientific activity at\nCMS.\n\nFigure 15: An example webpage of the CMS eLab\n\n7\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n7.3.\n\n8\n\nCMS Masterclass\n\nPhysicists look at CMS particle collisions in event displays to see what happened or in histograms of multiple events. On\nMasterclass Day, it is students who are physicists for a day. In 2011 the CMS Masterclass had 197 students in the U.S., 13\ninstitutes in the U.S. plus approx 30 non-US institutes.\n\nFigure 16: Monitoring the CMS Masterclass on EVO\n\n7.4.\n\nIceCube Outreach Programs\n\nThe IceCube has an extensive and ongoing program of education and outreach. Some of the emphasis is on informal\nlearning\n\nFigure 17: Informal learning by the IceCube collaboration\nSome of the informal learning occurs at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. Some 500,000 visitors per year see a dynamic\ndisplay of real data. In Madison, Wisconsin, they participate in a hands-on ice drilling activity. It simulates the building of\nthe IceCube detector and is appropriate for all ages\nIceCube also has blogs and broadcasts from the South Pole, covering wintering over at the Pole, hot water drilling, and\ncomputing, running and maintaining the IceCube detector. Their curriculum covers: introduction to particle physics, access\nto real IceCube data, and generalization of concepts to illustrate abstract ideas.\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n7.5.\n\n9\n\nQuarked!\n\nQuarked! is a physics education project for ages 7 and up (based in at the University of Kansas). Project components\ninclude:\n\uf0b7 Interactive web site (www.quarked.org) with animated videos, games, lesson-plans, FAQS, glossary, videos, etc.\n\uf0b7 Hands on science programs for elementary and middle school students\n\uf0b7 Links with QuarkNet, NSF informal science education and other grants\n\nFigure 18: Homepage of Quarked!\nThe program's education programs are\n\uf0b7 How Small is Small? (Grades 2 to 6)\n\uf0b7 Quarks: Ups, Downs and the Universe (Grades 4 & up)\nThe unusual aspect of this program is the target audience. This age group was chosen because at \"this stage young\npeople are open to everything and don't know that physics is hard.\" The organizers believe that you can engage elementary\n& middle school aged children with concepts related to particle physics. They point out that over 5000 children participated\nfrom Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado in hands-on shows. Assessment has been done with students and their teachers and\nshows that the program is successful. The website continues to have over 5000 visitors per month.\n\n7.6.\n\nLigo Outreach Programs\n\nThe Ligo programs in a variety of outreach efforts and feature the Louisiana Science Education Center, which is a 5000\nsq. foot Science Education Center. They conduct tours, present exhibits, and focus on K-12 and teacher development.\n\nFigure 19: Ligo's Louisiana Science Education Center\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n7.7.\n\n10\n\nSanford Underground Lab Outreach Programs\n\nThe Sanford Underground Lab at the Homestake Mine in South Dakota aims at nationwide outreach. Their goals include\nexhibits, web features, games, blogs, student training, science fairs and festivals. Planning is underway for the Sanford\nCenter for Science Education (SCSE):\n\u2013 Leveraged by a substantial pledge from philanthropist T. Denny Sanford, the SCSE will be the education and outreach\narm of DUSEL or its DOE equivalent\n\u2013 The SCSE is envisioned to feature and leverage the science and engineering of the underground lab to excite and help\nprepare the next generation of scientists and engineers -- and also the broader citizenry.\n\nFigure 20: The campus of the Sanford Underground Lab\nEarly activities are building partnerships and capacity, and testing content for a variety of audiences. Special efforts are\nmade to serve American Indian audiences, approximately 10% of the regional population.\n\n7.8.\n\nMSU Planetarium Outreach Project\n\nA planetarium outreach project at Michigan State University focuses on ATLAS at the planetarium. It is an outreach\ncomponent of the NSF CAREER grant of Reinhard Schwienhorst. It aims to bring ATLAS, LHC, and HEP to planetarium\naudiences. Working in close cooperation with the Abrams Planetarium at MSU, they have already produced a 5-minute\nplanetarium clip, which plays at the end of each public show. They are working on a full planetarium show to debut this\nfall.\n\nFigure 21: Example of a scene from the MSU planetarium show.\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n11\n\nThe planetarium display environment has both video projector and slide projectors. The show design is by MSU\nstudents: undergraduates, professors, graduate student,... with support from experts: a professional writing professor, a\ncommunication graphics and design professor, and a planetarium show developer\n\n7.9.\n\nPierre Auger Observatory Outreach Projects\n\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory is in Malarg\u00fce, Mendoza Province, Argentina. They have over 10 years of outreach in\nMendoza and beyond, with a positive impact in all communities. The collaboration takes part in local traditions and fosters\na sense of partnership in Auger's scientific mission. The Auger Visitor Center in its headquarters has hosted over 65,000\nvisitors since opening in 2001. The collaboration partnered with the Mendoza Province to construct the new James Cronin\nSchool in Malarg\u00fce in 2007\n\nFigure 22: The new James Cronin School in Malarg\u00fce, Argentina\nTheir Rural Schools Program features observatory staff volunteer who bring cosmic ray science and infrastructure\nimprovements to remote schools that cannot travel to Malarg\u00fce. The Collaboration sponsored 3-day Science Fairs at the\nObservatory in 2005, 2007, and 2010 drawing student and teacher teams from all over the Province. Collaborators serve as\njudges.\nStudents use reconstructed air shower data released online for science fairs and independent research projects.\nhttp://www.auger.org (5 languages, 4000 hits per year). Collaborators offer courses in hands-on science instruction to local\nteachers.\n\n7.10.\n\nPlain English Summaries\n\nThe concept of descriptions of experimental results understandable by the public (or perhaps the scientifically literate\npublic) dates back at least to some of the LEP experiments. The specific idea of \"Plain English Summaries\" of\nexperimental papers seems to have originated with the DOE and CDF experiments at the Fermilab TeVatron Collider. The\nATLAS Experiment at CERN has begun writing plain English summaries, including one asking: \"Is nature\nsupersymmetric?\", one on dijet events, and one summarizing the results presented by ATLAS at the Lepton Photon\nConference in Mumbai.\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n12\n\nFigure 23: Example of a figure\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to especially thank the speakers in the parallel session whose talks I have very quickly summarized (see their\ntalks for all the details).
