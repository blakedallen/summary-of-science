Introduction\nThe field of extrasolar planets is developing rapidly, producing exciting results at an accelerated pace. The discovery of the first extrasolar \"hot Jupiter\" around the nearby\nsolar-type star 51 Peg using precise radial velocity measurements (Mayor & Queloz, 1995) spurred a number of discoveries. Chief among these was the discovery of transits around the\nnearby solar-type star HD 209458 (Charbonneau et al., 2000;\nHenry et al., 2000). The success of the radial velocity studies also boosted extrasolar planetary searches using other techniques such as microlensing and transits. Currently more than\n60 transiting extrasolar planets are known1. Many candidates\nwere discovered by the OGLE team who carried out systematic searches, monitoring millions of stars along fields located in the Milky Way disk (Udalski et al., 2002a,b, 2003;\nSend offprint requests to: P. Pietrukowicz,\ne-mail: pietruk@astro.puc.cl\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected with the Very Large Telescope at\nParanal Observatory (ESO Programme 075.C-0427(A), DM and JMF\nvisiting observers).\n\u22c6\u22c6\nPhotometry of the transiting objects is available at the CDS via\nanonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\n1\nSee http://exoplanets.eu/\n\nPont et al., 2008). Of more than 200 transiting candidates, already seven OGLE transits have been confirmed as being\ndue to planets: OGLE-TR-10 (Konacki et al., 2005), OGLETR-56 (Konacki et al., 2003), OGLE-TR-111 (Pont et al.,\n2004), OGLE-TR-113 (Bouchy et al., 2004; Konacki et al.,\n2004), OGLE-TR-132 (Bouchy et al., 2004), OGLE-TR-182\n(Pont et al., 2008), OGLE-TR-211 (Udalski et al., 2008). Most\nof the other targets are eclipsing low-mass stars or brown dwarfs,\nor due to blends of normal stars, triplets, etc.\nWhy such interest in observing transiting candidates? The\nradial velocities give orbital parameters such as period, semimajor axis, and projected mass (M sin i). The transits give not\nonly the orbital parameters like period and inclination, but also\nthe planet sizes: the eclipse amplitude is simply (r/R)2 . Thus,\nfrom combined radial velocities and transits we know the mass\nof the planet without the inclination ambiguity, and the radius,\nwhich gives a density. The few planets so studied appear to be\nindeed inflated gaseous planets, i.e. \"hot Jupiters\". One difficulty\nis that the derived planet radii are only good to 10-15%. More accurate transit photometry is needed to improve those estimates,\nas argued by Moutou et al. (2004). For example the discoveries\nby Pont et al. (2005a,b) of planet-sized stars around OGLE-TR106 and OGLE-TR-122, help to constrain the models of planetary systems. These planets are under intense irradiation, which\n\n\f2\n\nP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\ninflates their sizes, depending on their own orbital parameters\nand intrinsic characteristics (Baraffe et al., 2003; Burrows et al.,\n2002). In some way the OGLE planets constitute the extreme\ncases, because of their very short periods.\nWe conducted a programme to monitor photometrically\nthe OGLE transit candidates, and here we present precise\nphotometry for these transits. Some of the objects, namely\nOGLE-TR-109, OGLE-TR-111, OGLE-TR-113 have been already analyzed by Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2006), Minniti et al. (2007),\nD\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007), respectively. In this paper we present an analysis of all OGLE transits in the VIMOS images. We also have\nsearched for new transits.\nSection 2 gives details on the observations, selection and\nproperties of the sample. Section 3 describes reductions of the\ndata. In sections 4-8 we present the results obtained from the\nobserved light curves of the OGLE transits. Section 9 describes\nnew transiting candidates we have found in the data. Finally, section 10 states our main conclusions.\n\n2. The sample\nOur program was allocated 4 nights with VIMOS at the Unit\nTelescope 3 (UT3) of the European Southern Observatory Very\nLarge Telescope (ESO VLT) at Paranal Observatory during the\nnights of April 9 to 12, 2005. All four nights were clear throughout, with sub-arcsecond seeing during most of the time.\nBefore the run we prepared maps of the positions of the transit candidates in the OGLE fields and computed OGLE transit ephemerides. The selection of fields was based mostly on\nmaximizing the number of interesting transiting candidates to be\nmonitored given the VIMOS field of view. VIMOS is an imager\nand multi-object spectrograph (LeFevre et al., 2003). Its field of\nview consists of four 7\u2032 \u00d78\u2032 fields covered by the four CCD chips\narranged in a square pattern with a separation gap of about 2\u2032 .\nThe CCD size is 2048 \u00d7 2440 pixels with a pixel size of 0.\u2032\u2032 205.\nWe selected four fields in Carina, that contain (but are not\ncentered on) the following transit candidates: OGLE-TR-86,\nOGLE-TR-113, OGLE-TR-167, and OGLE-TR-170. We will\nrefer to these fields as F86, F113, F167, and F170, respectively.\nTable 1 gives basic information on the monitored fields. In Fig. 1\nwe show the map of field F113 with OGLE transit candidates included.\nWe monitored these four fields, with a basic strategy to maximize the observing efficiency trying to cover as many transit\ncandidates as possible. Two fields per night were observed alternatively, with three 15 sec images acquired per field before\nmoving to the other field. With the help of the ESO Paranal staff,\nwe reduced the nominal 9 min overhead between two different\nfield exposures to 90 sec. Typically we obtained 150-300 images per night per field, resulting in well-sampled transits. All 32\nOGLE transit candidates located in the VIMOS fields are listed\nin Table 2. This table indicates which candidates were expected\nto transit during our observations.\nWe observed with the V filter only, since the sampling rate\ndid not allow us to use two filters, and previous I-band observations are available from the OGLE database. One of the\nmain objectives of this work was to discard blends and binary\nstars present among the transit candidates thanks to characteristic shape of transit events. Also the light curves measured\nin the V-band can be compared with the I-band OGLE light\ncurves. While the I-band is more efficient for transit searches\n(Pepper & Gaudi, 2005), the V-band shows the effects of limb\ndarkening during the transit better, and is more suitable for the\nmodelling of the transit parameters.\n\nFig. 1. Location of OGLE transit candidates in the area of\nOGLE-TR-113 or VIMOS field F113. VIMOS quadrants are\nmarked and labeled as A2, A3, B1 and B4.\n\n3. Photometry\nThe bulk of the data acquired with VIMOS amounts to 82 GB.\nThe periphery of VIMOS images in each quadrant suffers from\ncoma. Therefore, for our analysis we cut a slightly smaller area\nof 1900\u00d72100 pixels, covering 7.\u2032 18\u00d76.\u2032 49. The photometry was\nextracted with the help of the Difference Image Analysis Package\n(DIAPL)2 written by Wo\u017aniak (2000) and recently modified by\nW. Pych. The package is an implementation of the method developed by Alard & Lupton (1998). To get better quality of photometry we worked on 475 \u00d7 525 pixel subfields.\nReference frames were constructed by combining the 8-13\nbest individual images (depending on the field and the quadrant). Profile photometry for the reference frame was extracted\nwith DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR (Stetson, 1987). These measurements were used to transform the light curves from differential\nflux units into instrumental magnitudes, which later were transformed to the standard V-band magnitudes by adding an offset derived from V-band magnitudes of the transits in the fields\n(D\u0131\u0301az et al., 2007; Minniti et al., 2007).\nThe 15 sec exposure times saturate stars at V \u2248 15.4 mag\nin the images under the best seeing. This affected two transit\ncandidates: OGLE-TR-88 and OGLE-TR-112.\nThe brightest planetary transit candidate monitored here is\nOGLE-TR-109, with I = 14.99 and V = 15.82 mag, for which\nphotometry with \u03c3V = 0.002 mag was obtained. The faintest\ncandidate is OGLE-TR-108, with I = 17.28 and V = 18.73 mag\nat \u03c3V = 0.009 mag.\nDue to the coma the photometric quality at the extreme corners of the VIMOS fields is degraded. This affects the data for\nOGLE-TR-126, and to a minor degree for OGLE-TR-87 and\nOGLE-TR-108.\n2\n\nThe package is available at http://users.camk.edu.pl/pych/DIAPL/\n\n\fP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Results\nTwenty one transits were expected for 18 OGLE stars during the\nobservations. Figure 2 illustrates the transit times calculated for\ncandidates in the field F113. For object OGLE-TR-109 with the\nshort period of P = 0.589127 d, four transits were expected.\nThe object OGLE-TR-112 is saturated and no photometry was\nobtained in this case. In total, we observed thirteen events in 11\nstars. Six transits were not detected and one is under question,\ndue to worse seeing at the end of night 4.\nFor 14 stars no transits were expected. However, even\nflat light curves are useful to examine possible light curve\nmodulations due to ellipsoidal variability (Drake et al., 2003;\nSirko & Paczy\u0144ski, 2007).\nTable 2 also indicates whether we observed a full transit, a\npartial transit, no transit, or sinusoidal variations. The relatively\nsmall number of expected and detected transits in the fields F86\nand F167 is the result of the short period of observation of these\ntwo fields. The highest efficiency is for F113, which is the only\nfield observed for almost all 4 nights.\n\n5. The Significance of the Transits\n\n115\nTR-114\nTR-113\nTR-112\nTR-111\n110\n\nTR-110\nTR-109\nTR-108\n\nTR-106\n105\n\nTR-105\n\n3470\n\n3472\n\n3474\n\nJD [-2450000]\n\nBecause we will be dealing with potential unconfirmed transits\nor false positives, it is necessary to find a quantitative way to\nevaluate the significance of the individual transits observed.\nThe observed transits are well sampled in the V band, and\nthe scatter is smaller than that of the OGLE transits. There are\ntypically Ntr = 30 \u2212 60 points per transit in our data. VIMOS\ntransits are well sampled, allowing us to measure accurate amplitudes as a difference between averages of the points outside and at the bottom of the transits. In the case of OGLE,\nthe significance of the transits is in part judged by the num-\n\nFig. 2. Computed transit times for nine OGLE candidates in the\nfield F113.\n\nber of transits detected (from a few to about 30). In the case\nof the present study, we compute the signal-to-noise of the single, well sampled transit. For a given photometric precision of a\nsingle measurement of \u03c3ph and a transit depth A, this signal-to-\n\n\f4\n\nP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\nnoise transit is S /N = Ntr1/2 A/\u03c3ph (Gaudi, 2005). For the monitored transits we find the range of S /N to be 20-50 for typical\n\u03c3ph = 0.004 \u2212 0.005 mag. The error bars in the OGLE data are\ntypically by 40-60% larger than from VIMOS.\nWe also computed the significance of the transits considering\nthe presence of correlated noise in the light curves, following the\nmethod described in Pont et al. (2006). Since we found that our\nlight curves exhibit moderate red noise, the values of the S /N\nreported below for different transits have been computed using\nthis method.\nIt is also important to compute accurate mean times of transit as well as to evaluate the transit timing errors, for studies of\nmultiplicity in these systems, as it has been done in the case of\nOGLE-TR-111 by D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2008). The precision with which\nthe mean transit\u221atime can be determined can be estimated as:\n\u03b4tr = \u03c3ph ttr /(2A Ntr ), where ttr is the transit duration, Ntr is the\nnumber of measurements within transit (Deeg et al., 2004).\n\n6. Full OGLE Transits\nThese objects allowed us to measure fundamental parameters of\nthe systems by applying analytical and empirical models that\nmimic transiting light curves. In our work we used the method\npresented in Mandel & Agol (2002). For error estimation we\nused the \"rosary-bead\" method fitting the light curves with the\ndownhill-simplex algorithm (Bouchy et al., 2005; Southworth,\n2008; Winn et al., 2008). Below we discuss each of the observed\nobjects.\n\nFig. 3. Comparison of light curves for OGLE-TR-106 from\nOGLE (top panel) and VIMOS (bottom panel). The magnitude\nscale and the time scale are the same for both panels. Fit to the\nVIMOS data is presented.\n\n6.1. OGLE-TR-106\n\n6.3. OGLE-TR-111\n\nIn Fig. 3 we compare light curves for this object in the I (OGLE)\nand V (VIMOS) bands. The transit occurred at the beginning of\nnight 4 as it was predicted. The shape of the event resembles\na planetary transit, but it is not! Pont et al. (2005a), based on 8\nspectra obtained with FLAMES instrument at ESO VLT/UT2\ntelescope, show that this is an eclipsing binary, where the secondary is an M dwarf of the mass of only 0.116 \u00b1 0.021 M\u2299 .\nIn Fig. 3 we also present our best fit to the VIMOS curve, using linear limb-darkening coefficient for the V band. This fit\n+1.1\nyields ratios r/R = 0.145+0.007\n\u22120.006, a/R = 13.3\u22122.1 , the impact pa+0.29\nrameter b = a/R cos i = 0.35\u22120.35 at inclination i \u2248 90\u25e6 . The\nlimb-darkening law parameter was fixed to u = 0.6. The estimated radius ratio is in agreement at 1\u03c3 level with the value\nof r/R = 0.138 \u00b1 0.014 derived from R = 1.31 \u00b1 0.09 and\nr = 0.181 \u00b1 0.013 (Pont et al., 2005a).\n\nThis transit is caused by a hot Jupiter (Pont et al., 2004). It was\nanalyzed in detail by Minniti et al. (2007). The VIMOS data allowed them to refine the planetary radius, obtaining r = 1.01 \u00b1\n0.06 R J . Our estimation of the radius ratios, r/R=0.1284+0.0066\n\u22120.0033\nand a/R=12.31+0.74\n\u22121.56, is in excellent agreement with the published\n+1.00\nvalues of 0.1245+0.0050\n\u22120.0030 and 12.11\u22121.39, respectively. Recently,\nD\u0131\u0301az et al. (2008) found possible period variations in this system\nwhich could be explained by the presence of a perturbing planet\nwith the mass of the Earth in an exterior orbit. Fig. 5 presents\nour best fit to the VIMOS data.\n\n6.2. OGLE-TR-109\n\nThis is an extreme case among the transiting candidates found\nby the OGLE group because of early spectral type of the star\n(F0V), low transit amplitude (AI \u2248 0.008 mag), and very short\nperiod (P = 0.589127 d). Analysis of these photometric data by\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. (2006), and analysis of high-resolution spectroscopic data by Pont et al. (2005a), have left the nature of the object undetermined. Two scenarios are possible: OGLE-TR-109\nis either a blend with a background eclipsing binary or a transiting planet. However, the latter possibility seems to be less likely\ndue to the very short orbital period. Fig. 4 shows both OGLE and\nVIMOS light curves. In comparison to the results published in\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. (2006) the transit S /N is slightly better in this\nwork (20 vs. 17), but still insufficient to resolve more details in\nthe light curve.\n\n6.4. OGLE-TR-113\n\nThis is another planetary transit (Bouchy et al., 2004). It was expected to occur at the end of night 2 and it did. D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007)\nused the VIMOS data to obtain new estimates for orbit parameters, radius and mean density of the planet OGLE-TR-113b.\nThe radius ratios we have found are almost identical to the values they obtained: r/R=0.1451+0.0064\n\u22120.0022 vs. 0.1455 \u00b1 0.0083, and\na/R=6.49+0.10\nvs.\n6.48\n\u00b1\n0.09.\nThe light curves and the fit are\n\u22120.66\nshown in Fig. 6. Our new period estimation, P=1.4324772(12) d,\nis in excellent agreement with the value of 1.4324757(13) d derived by Gillon et al. (2006) on the base of NTT/SUSI2 data\ntaken almost at the same time (on 2005 Apr 3, 13).\n6.5. OGLE-TR-159\n\nThis object is located in the field of OGLE-TR-167. A transit occurred in the middle of night 2, as it was expected from OGLE\nephemeris. The transit duration ttr was approximately 3.2 hours,\nwith about 45 data points (\u03b4tr = 1.3 min). We measured an am-\n\n\fP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\nFig. 4.

The transit portion of the light curve\ndoes not show a flat bottom (see Fig. 7), indicating a large impact\nparameter for this system. Following Mandel & Agol (2002), we\n\u25e6\nobtained r/R = 0.41+0.03\n\u22120.20 and inclination i = 74 . We conclude\nthat OGLE-TR-159 is a very likely eclipsing binary.\n\n5\n\nFig. 5. Comparison of light curves for OGLE-TR-111 from\nOGLE (top) and VIMOS (bottom). The magnitude scale and the\ntime scale are the same for both panels. The figure also shows\nthe best transit fit for this object.\n\n6.6. OGLE-TR-170\n\nOGLE-TR-159 and OGLE-TR-170, for which V-shape eclipses\nwere detected, the obtained parameter distributions are bimodal,\nand therefore the given numbers are not very representative of\nthe distributions. In the table we report median values at 68%\nconfidence level.\n\nThe transit OGLE-TR-170 occurred in the middle of night 3 and\nlasted for ttr \u2248 4.3 h (see Fig. 8). There are more than 70 photometric points (\u03b4tr = 1.8 min) within the transit. We measured\nan amplitude AV = 0.036 \u00b1 0.006 mag with a transit signal-tonoise of S /N \u2248 50, again in agreement at 1\u03c3 level with the Iband measurements: AI = 0.030 \u00b10.015 mag. As for OGLE-TR159, this transit does not show a flat bottom. It is very likely that\nOGLE-TR-170 is an eclipsing system observed during a grazing\neclipse.\n\nTable 3. Geometrical parameters determined for six systems. In\nthe columns we provide: ratio of the radii of the components\nr/R, ratio of the radius of the orbit of the secondary to the radius\nof the primary, impact parameter b, and linear limb-darkening\ncoefficient u. For objects OGLE-TR-109, OGLE-TR-111, and\nOGLE-TR-113 the limb-darkening coefficient was taken from\nClaret (2000).\n\n6.7. OGLE-TR-171\n\nThis transit occurred at the beginning of night 3 lasting about\n2.5 hours. We measured an amplitude AV = 0.032 \u00b1 0.009 mag\nwith a transit signal-to-noise of S /N \u2248 22, what gave similar\nvalues as in the I band: AI = 0.038\u00b10.015, ttr = 2.5 h. The transit\nseems to be asymmetric (Fig. 9). In both light curves, OGLE and\nVIMOS, the minimum occurred earlier than the central moment\nof the event. The asymmetry cannot be caused by a transiting\nplanet, but could indicate a matter flow between the components\nor the presence of a disk around one of the stars.\nIn Table 3 we summarize geometrical parameters obtained\nfor six out of seven fully observed OGLE transits.

OGLE-TR-86\n\nThis transit occurred at the end of night 1 as it was expected\nfrom OGLE data. We got only the ingress phase (see Fig. 10), so\nwe could not measure the flatteness of the light curve during the\nevent.\n7.2. OGLE-TR-91\n\nThe transit OGLE-TR-91 was expected in the middle of night 1,\nbut it occurred at the beginning of that night. The transit portion\nof the light curve (Fig. 11) shows a flat bottom, indicating a relatively small impact parameter for this system. We measured an\namplitude AV = 0.037 \u00b1 0.004 mag, in agreement with OGLE\nmeasurements: AI = 0.043 \u00b1 0.015 mag. However, trapeziumlike shape of the event with long ingress and egress rather rules\nout planetary nature of the transit. A light curve modulation,\nprobably due to ellipsoidal variability, is also seen.\n\nThis transit occurred at the end of night 2 as it was expected from\nOGLE data. As for OGLE-TR-86, we only got the beginning of\nthe transit of OGLE-TR-167 (Fig. 13), so we couldn't measure\nthe flatteness of the light curve during the event.\nFor all partial transits but OGLE-TR-91 only V-band amplitude lower limits could be measured. For the object OGLE-TR91, which is the only partial transit with a flat bottom, we estimated the central moment of the event. For the other three objects their periods were improved using either ingress or egress\nmoments. From the shape of the observed partial transits we conclude that none of them was caused by a planet.\nIn Table 4 we summarize photometric data on eleven objects with observed transits. The measured V-band amplitudes\nof full transits are generally larger than the amplitudes measured\nin the I band (see Fig. 14). This agrees with the fact that stellar\nlimb darkening in the V band should be shallower at the edges\nbut deeper by 10-20% in the central parts (Claret & Hautschildt,\n2003).\n\n8. Absent OGLE Transits\n8.1. OGLE-TR-82\n\n7.3. OGLE-TR-110\n\nThis object is located in the field F113. We observed only the\negress of the transit on night 2 (Fig. 12). Good agreement with\nthe prediction time indicates good estimation of the period from\nOGLE data. Slow egress (0.03 mag in 1.5 h) clearly rules out\nplanetary nature of the event. This was confirmed by Pont et al.\n(2005a) who found large radial velocity difference in two sets of\nspectral lines, like in a binary.\n\nThis star lies in the field F86, which was monitored for only\n8 hours. A transit was predicted to occur at the end of night 1, but\nthe observations of the field were finished about 2 hours before\nthe dawn and no event could not be recorded. The flat portion of\nthe light curve (see Fig. 15) was measured with a photometric\nprecision of 0.003 mag, allowing us to detect a sinusoidal variation of a full amplitude of 0.0035 mag and a period of \u223c 0.23 d,\nwhich is different to the transiting period of P = 0.76416 d.\nRecently Hoyer et al.

The\nvariability may come from the blend.\n8.2. OGLE-TR-84\n\nThis object is located in the field F86. According to Pont et al.\n(2005a) it is a likely eclipsing system. An eclipse was expected\nat the beginning of night 1, but it was not detected.\n\nProbably this is a triple system (Pont et al., 2005a). In this case\nwe expected to see a transit at the beginning of night 1, but nothing was observed.\n8.4. OGLE-TR-108\n\nThis star is located in F113 field which was observed during all\n4 nights. Our ephemerides for OGLE-TR-108 predicted a transit\nin the middle of night 3, and a secondary transit for night 1, but\nwe did not detect anything.\n\n\f8\n\nP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\nFig. 10.

OGLE-TR-114\n\nA spectroscopic follow up made by Pont et al. (2005a) showed\nthat this object is a triple system. A transit was expected at the\n\nend of night 4, but due to worse seeing there is no clear evidence\nfor the event.\n\n\fP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\n9\n\n8.7. OGLE-TR-172\n\nThe star is located in the VIMOS field F170. A transit expected\nto occur in the middle of night 4 was not observed.\nIt is very likely that the seven transits mentioned above were\nnot observed due to two facts: short VIMOS observational run\nand lost of ephemerides for the objects. This is clearly seen in the\ncase of the transits from the field F86 which was observed only\nfor 8 hours. The time interval between the OGLE and VIMOS\nobservations was approximately three years. Exact time uncertainties in the OGLE data are not given, but we assess them to be\nbelow 0.0005 d. After the three years the errors of the expected\nmoments of the transits could have accumulated to a significant\nfraction of the orbital period.\n\n9. New candidates\n\nFig. 14. I-band amplitudes vs. V-band amplitudes of the transits.\nFully and partially observed transits are marked with full and\nopen triangles, respectively.\n\nWe have also looked for new transit candidates in the VIMOS\ndata. This has been done in the framework of our variable search\npresented in Pietrukowicz et al. (2009). Finding charts and light\ncurves of four new candidates are shown in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17,\nrespectively. Table 5 gives the most important observational facts\non the transits. The first two objects are located in the field F167\nand the other two in the field F170. These are rather faint stars\nwith 17.8 < V < 19.7 mag. The transits have amplitudes between 0.02 and 0.04 mag in V, and durations from about 2 to\n5 hours. All events were detected only once during our VIMOS\nrun, therefore there is no information on periods. We also note\nthat for the transits 1-3 no events were detected in the OGLE-III\ndata. The transit-4, due to its depth and relatively long duration,\nis potentially the best candidate for hosting a planet. This object lies outside OGLE-III fields and is a good target for future\nsurveys.\n\nFig. 16. Finding charts for the new transit candidates. North is\nup and East to the left. The field of view is 10\u2032\u2032 on a side. The\ntransiting stars lie exactly in the centers of the charts.\n\n10. Summary\nFig. 15. Comparison of light curves for OGLE-TR-82 from\nOGLE (top) and VIMOS (bottom). A sinusoidal fit to the\nVIMOS data is presented.\n\n8.6. OGLE-TR-162\n\nThis object can be found in the field F167. In this case we hoped\nto observe a transit in the middle of night 2, but nothing was\ndetected.\n\nV-band images from VLT/VIMOS were used to obtain light\ncurves of extrasolar planetary transits: OGLE-TR-111, OGLETR-113, and candidate planetary transits: OGLE-TR-109,\nOGLE-TR-159, OGLE-TR-167, OGLE-TR-170, OGLE-TR171. With difference imaging photometry we were able to\nachieve millimagnitude errors in the individual data points. The\nfollowing seven OGLE transits were recorded as full events:\n106, 109, 111, 113, 159, 170, 171. Four transits were detected\nas partial events: 86, 91, 110, 167. All full and partial transits\nbut OGLE-TR-91 and OGLE-TR-109 were observed at the predicted transit times. No transits were recorded for 19 objects.\n\n\f10\n\nP.Pietrukowicz et al.: Millimagnitude Photometry for OGLE Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Candidates\n\nTable 5.

New transit candidates found in VIMOS data.\nBased on the shape of the obtained light curves and some results from spectroscopic follow-up studies we show that the objects OGLE-TR-111 and OGLE-TR-113 are probably the only\nOGLE stars in the sample to host planets.\nIn the paper we also report on four new transiting candidates\nwe have found in the VIMOS data. One of the events, transit-4,\nwith the duration time of about 3.7 h and the amplitude of about\n0.02 mag, is a particularly good candidate for a planetary transit.\nFaintness of the object (17.8 mag in V) may severely hamper\nspectroscopic verification. However, all four candidates require\nphotometric follow-up studies to look for their periodic nature\nfirst.\nAcknowledgements.
