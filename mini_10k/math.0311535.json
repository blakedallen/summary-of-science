In this paper we show\nhow this can be used to characterise the maximal independent sets in\ncertain classes of graphs. As a corollary we show that a graph defined\non the partitions of {1, . . . , 9} with three cells of size three is a core.\n\u2217\n\nResearch supported by NSERC.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet P(33 ) be the graph whose vertices are the partitions of {1, . . . , 9} with\nthree cells of size three, where two such partitions are adjacent if each triple\nin one partition contains one point from each triple of the other. (We will say\nthat two such partitions are skew.) Elementary arguments yield that P(33 )\nis a regular graph with valency 36 and with 280 vertices.\nIn [11], Meagher and Stevens ask whether this graph is a core; this calls\nfor some definitions. If X and Y are graphs, a map f from V (X) to V (Y ) is a\nhomomorphism if, whenever u and v are adjacent vertices in X, their images\nf (x) and f (y) are adjacent in Y . An endomorphism of X is a homomorphism\nfrom X to itself. Any automorphism of X is an endomorphism and we\nsay that X is a core if all endomorphisms of X are automorphisms. For\nbackground on these topics, see [7, Chapter 6].\nIn this paper we prove that P(33 ) is a core. The central part of our\nargument is a determination of the independent sets of maximal size. The\nmethod we use has other applications; we present two of these.\n\n2\n\nAssociation Schemes\n\nAn association scheme is a set of regular graphs whose edge sets partition the\nedges of the complete graph in a particularly nice way. The precise definition\nis longer, and is stated in terms of the adjacency matrices of the graphs. An\nassociation scheme A with d classes is a set A0 , . . . , Ad of 01-matrices such\nthat\n(a) A0 = I.\nPd\n(b)\ni=0 Ai = J.\n(c) ATi \u2208 A.\n\n(d) Ai Aj lies in the span of A (over R).\n(e) Ai Aj = Aj Ai\nHere J denotes the matrix with all entries equal to 1. If the matrices in A are\nall symmetric, we say that the scheme is symmetric. All the schemes in this\npaper will be symmetric. In this case the matrices A1 , . . . , Ad are adjacency\n2\n\n\fmatrices\nP of graphs X1 , . . . , Xd . Since the matrices in A commute and since\nJ =\nAi , we see that Ai J = JAi for all i, whence the graphs Xi must be\nregular. We denote the number of vertices of these graphs by v, and the\nvalency of Xi by vi .\nLet C[A] denote the span of A over C. This space is closed under matrix\nmultiplication (by (d) above), and is called the Bose-Mesner algebra of the\nscheme. Since this algebra is closed under transpose and complex conjugation, the matrices in it can be simultaneously diagonalised. More precisely, if\nthe matrices Ai are v \u00d7v, the theory shows that that are subspaces U0 , . . . , Ud\nwhose sum is Cv and such that Uj is contained in an eigenspace of Ai for all\ni and j. It is traditional to denote the eigenvalue of Ai on Uj by pi (j), and\nto call the matrix P such that\nPi,j = pj (i).\nThus the i-th column of P gives the eigenvalues of Ai . The dimension of Uj is\ndenoted by mj . The modified matrix of eigenvalues is obtained by replacing\nthe first column of P with the multiplicities mi .\nNow let Ej denote the orthogonal projection onto Uj . Then the matrices\nEj form a second basis for C[A]. (The problem is to show that they lie in\nC[A].) We have the following useful result due to Seidel. For a proof, see [6,\nThm. 12.6.1].\n2.1 Theorem. Suppose the matrices A0 , . . . , Ad form an association scheme\non v vertices with projections E0 , . . . , Ed . Then for any vector x,\nX xT Ai x\nX xT Ej x\nAi =\nEj .\nvvi\nmj\ni\nj\n\n3\n\nIndependent Sets\n\nWe start by giving a bound on the size of an independent set. For a proof see,\nfor example [7, Lemma 9.6.2]. For graphs from association schemes (which\nis the only case we need), it follows from work of Delsarte [2]. We call this\nresult the ratio bound for \u03b1(X).\n3.1 Theorem. Let X be a regular graph on v vertices with valency k and\nleast eigenvalue \u03c4 . Then\nv\n\u03b1(X) \u2264\n;\n1 \u2212 k\u03c4\n3\n\n\fif equality holds and x is the characteristic vector of an independent set of\nmaximum size, then x \u2212 \u03b1(X)\n1 is an eigenvector for A(X) with eigenvalue\nv\n\u03c4.\nWe apply this bound to P(33 ). Fortunately the eigenvalues of P(33 ) have\nalready been determined.\nIf \u03c0 and \u03c3 are two partitions of {1, . . . , 9} with three cells of size three,\nthen their meet \u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3 has 3, 9, 7, 6 or 5 cells. Thus we can form four graphs\nX1 , . . . , X4 with these partitions as their vertices, where partitions \u03c0 and \u03c3\nare adjacent in X1 , X2 , X3 or X4 according as the number of cells of \u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3\nis 9, 7, 6 or 5. Mathon and Rosa [10] show that these four graphs are the\ngraphs of an association scheme with four classes with modified matrix of\neigenvalues:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n36 162 54 27\n\uf8ec 27 \u221212 \u22126 6 11 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 48\n\uf8f7\n8\n\u22126\n\u22129\n6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 120 2\n\u22126 6 \u22123 \uf8f8\n84 \u22124 12 \u22126 \u22123\n\nThe second column of this matrix gives the eigenvalues of P(33 ). (For information on the eigenvalues of association schemes see, for example, [1,\nChapter 2].) We see that \u03c4 = \u221212, and that its multiplicity as an eigenvalue\nis 27. We conclude that\n\u03b1(P(33 )) \u2264\n\n280\n36 = 70.\n1 + 12\n\nIf 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 9, there are exactly 70 partitions of {1, . . . , 9} with three cells\nof size three in which i and j lie in the same cell. These 70 partitions form\nan independent set in P(33 ), which we denote by Si,j . We aim to show that\nany independent set in P(33 ) is of the form Si,j , for some i and j.\n\n4\n\nEigenvectors\n\nLet M be the 280 \u00d7 36 01-matrix with rows indexed by the 3 \u00d7 3 partitions,\ncolumns indexed by the 2-element subsets of {1, . . . , 9}, and with the entry\ncorresponding to the partition \u03c0 and the 2-element subset ij equal to 1 if and\nonly if ij is contained in a cell of \u03c0. Thus each row of M is the characteristic\n4\n\n\fvector of the set of 2-element subsets of {1, . . . , 9} that are contained in a\ncell of \u03c0. It follows that\n1\nM1 = 1.\n9\nIf B is the incidence matrix for K9 , the complete graph on nine vertices, then\nMB T = 2J.\nSince the rows of B are linearly independent, this implies that rk(M) \u2264 28.\nThe columns of M are the characteristic vectors of the independent sets Si,j .\nWe will prove that if x is the characteristic vector of an independent set of\nsize 70, then x lies in the column space of M.\n4.1 Lemma. The columns of matrix M \u2212 41 J are eigenvectors for A with\neigenvalue \u221212; they span a space with dimension 27.\nProof. The first claim is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.1. So we\nneed only determine rk(M). Since 91 M1 = 1, the vector 1 lies in the column\nspace of M. Since\n\u0010\n1 \u0011\nT\n1 M \u2212 J = 0,\n4\nit will be enough to prove that rk(M) = 28.\nRecall that rk(M) = rk(M T M). Let L denote the adjacency matrix of\nthe line graph L(K9 ). We note that\n|S1,2 | = 70, |S1,2 \u2229 S1,3 | = 10,\n\n|S1,2 \u2229 S3,4 | = 20\n\nand hence\nM T M = 70I + 10L + 20(J \u2212 I \u2212 L) = 50I + 20J \u2212 10L.\nThe spectrum of L is\n\u22122(27) , 5(8) , 14(1)\nAccordingly 0 is an eigenvalue of M T M with multiplicity eight (the eigenspace\nis spanned by the eigenvectors of L with eigenvalue 5), and therefore\nrk(M T M) = 28.\nHence rk(M) = 28.\n5\n\n\f4.2 Corollary. If x is the characteristic vector of an independent set of size\n70 in P(33 ), then x lies in the column space of M.\nProof. Set z = x \u2212 14 1. By the lemma, z lies in the column space of M. Since\n1 also lies in the column space of M, it follows that x does as well.\n\n5\n\nStructure of Independent Sets\n\nAs noted earlier, the matrix A lies in an association scheme with four classes.\nSuppose that A1 , A2 , A3 and A4 are the matrices corresponding to the last\nfour columns of the matrix of eigenvalues shown in Section 3. Then A1 = A\nand\nMM T = 9I + 2A2 + 3A3 + 5A4 .\n(1)\n(The number of 2-element subsets of the cells of \u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3 is determined by the\nnumber of cells of \u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3.) If the matrix idempotents of the Bose-Mesner\nalgebra of the association scheme are E0 , . . . , E4 , then\nMM T = 630E0 + 70E1 .\n\n(2)\n\n1\nJ and E1 represents orthogonal projection onto the column\nHere E0 = 280\nspace of M \u2212 14 J. (One way to prove the above identity is to note that MM T\nand M T M have the same non-zero eigenvalues with the same multiplicities;\nalternatively this can be read off the matrix of eigenvalues of the scheme.)\n\n5.1 Lemma. Suppose x is the characteristic vector of an independent subset\nS of P(33 ) with size 70. Then\n4\nX\nxT Ai x\ni=0\n\nvvi\n\n1\n1\n1\n5\n70\n70\nAi = I + A2 + A3 + A4 = E0 + E1 .\n4\n18\n12\n36\n4\n36\n\nProof. We use Seidel's identity, Theorem 2.1. Let x be the characteristic\nvector of an independent set with size 70. Then\nxT E0 x =\nWe also have\nE1 1 = 0,\n\n70 \u00d7 70\n70\n= .\n280\n4\n\n\u0010\n1\n1 \u0011\nE1 x \u2212 1 = x \u2212 1\n4\n4\n6\n\n\fand therefore\n\u0010\n1 \u0011T \u0010\n1 \u0011\n70 70 280\n210\nxT E1 x = x \u2212 1\nx \u2212 1 = 70 \u2212\n\u2212\n+\n=\n.\n4\n4\n4\n4\n16\n4\nNext\nE2 x = E3 x = E4 x = 0\nand so for our particular values, the right side of Seidel's identity is\n70\n70\nE0 + E1 .\n4\n36\nReferring to (2), we see this equals\n\n1\nMM T .\n36\n\nUsing (1), we then find that\n\n70\n70\n1\nE0 + E1 = (9I + 2A2 + 3A3 + 5A4 )\n4\n36\n36\nand the lemma follows from this.\nThe valencies v1 , . . . v4 appear in the first row of the modified matrix of\neigenvalues, the multiplicities mi are in the first column.\n5.2 Corollary. Let S be an independent set of size 70 on P(33 ). If \u03c0 \u2208 S,\nthen there are 36 partitions \u03c3 in S such that |\u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3| = 7, a further 18 such\nthat |\u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3| = 6 and 15 such that |\u03c0 \u2227 \u03c3| = 5.\n\n6\n\nThe Characterisation\n\nWe prove that an independent set of size 70 in P(33 ) must be one of the sets\nSi,j .\nLet S be some independent set of size 70 in P(33 ), and z its characteristic\nvector. By Theorem 3.1 we know that z \u2212 14 1 lies in the eigenspace of X with\neigenvalue \u221212 and, from Corollary 4.2, it follows that z lies in the column\nspace of M. From Lemma 5.1 we see that S must contain two vertices a and\nb whose meet has exactly seven cells-two pairs and five singletons.\nWe have za = zb = 1 and zt = 0 for all vertices t that are adjacent to a\nor b. Let M1 be the submatrix of M composed of the rows corresponding to\nthe vertices adjacent to a or b. There is a vector h such that z = Mh, and\nwe then have M1 h = 0. Let N be a matrix whose columns are a basis for\nthe null space of M1 , so h lies in the column space of N and z lies in the\n7\n\n\fcolumn space of MN. Let C be the matrix formed by the non-zero columns\nof the reduced column-echelon form of MN. Then there is a vector y such\nthat z = Cy. Since C is in reduced column form and has full column rank, it\nhas a set of rows that form an identity matrix of order rk(C) \u00d7 rk(C). Since\nz is a 01-vector, this implies that y is a 01-vector.\nWe now actually compute C using Maple, and find that its rank is six.\nTherefore y is one of 26 01-vectors and, using Maple again, we find that only\nthree of these choices for y have the property that Cy is a 01-vector: one of\nthese is the zero vector, and the other two are the characteristic vectors of\nthe two Sij that contain a and b.\nThe second Maple computation can be somewhat elided, as we now describe. It suffices to identify a submatrix C0 corresponding to a subset of\nthe rows of C such that whenever y and C0 y are 01-vectors then Cy is the\ncharacteristic vector of one of the two Sij that contain a and b, or the zero\nvector. We made no serious attempt to find an \"optimal\" C0 , but a casual\nglance at C reveals examples with m = 3.\n\n7\n\nA Core\n\nWe show that, if the sets Si,j are the only maximum independent sets in\nP(33 ), then P(33 ) is a core.\nLet X denote P(33 ) and suppose \u03c8 : X \u2192 X is a homomorphism. By\n[7, Lemma 7.5.4], the preimage \u03c8 \u22121 (Si,j ) is a maximum independent set in\nX, and hence is equal to Sk,l for some k and l. Each maximal independent\nset is determined by a 2-element subset of {1, . . . , 9}. The independent sets\ncorresponding to disjoint pairs have exactly 20 partitions in common, the sets\ncorresponding to distinct overlapping pairs have 10 elements in common. It\nfollows that \u03c8 \u22121 determines a map from the vertex set of L(K9 ) to itself. We\nshow first that this mapping is an endomorphism of L(K9 ).\nTo this end, consider the sets\n\u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 \u2229 S1,i ),\n\ni \u2208 {3, . . . , 9}.\n\nIf \u03b1 is a partition in \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 \u2229 S1,i ), then \u03c8(\u03b1) contains the cell {1, 2, i}. It\nfollows that the six preimages above are pairwise disjoint. Since\n\u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 \u2229 S1,i ) = \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 ) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,i )\n\n8\n\n\feach of the preimages has size 10 or 20. However the union of these preimages\nis \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 ), with size 70. We conclude that if i \u2208 {3, . . . , 9}, then\n|\u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 \u2229 S1,i )| = 10\nand so we see that \u03c8 \u22121 determines an endomorphism of L(K9 ).\nWe will show below that L(K9 ) is a core. It follows from this that \u03c8 \u22121 in\nfact determines an automorphism of L(K9 ). Therefore\n|\u03c8 \u22121 (Si,j \u2229 Sk,l )|\nis equal to 70, 10 or 20 according as the pairs ij and kl are equal, distinct\nand overlapping or disjoint.\nTo complete the argument, consider the partition \u03b1 with cells\n{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}.\nThen\n{\u03b1} = S1,2 \u2229 S1,3 \u2229 S4,5 \u2229 S4,6\nand\n\u03c8 \u22121 (\u03b1) = \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,2 ) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (S1,3 ) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (S4,5 ) \u2229 \u03c8 \u22121 (S4,6 ).\nNow {12, 13} and {45, 46} are vertex-disjoint edges in L(K9 ); since \u03c8 \u22121 induces an automorphism of L(K9 ), their images under \u03c8 \u22121 are vertex-disjoint\nedges too. Therefore \u03c8 \u22121 (\u03b1) 6= \u2205, and we have shown that \u03c8 is onto. We\nconclude that P(33 ) is a core.\nIt remains to show that L(K9 ) is a core.\n7.1 Lemma. L(K2m+1 ) is a core.\nProof. Let Y be the core of L(K2m+1 ). Then Y is vertex- and arc-transitive,\nand \u03c9(Y ) = 2m. Since Y is an induced subgraph of X, it is a line graph and\ntherefore it is the line graph of an edge-transitive graph W with at least one\nvertex of valency 2m. If W is not bipartite, it is vertex-transitive and hence\nregular; therefore W = K2m+1 . If W is bipartite it is semi-regular. If W has\ntwo vertices of degree 2m they must be adjacent and therefore, since W is\nedge-transitive, each edge joins two vertices of degree 2m and W = K2m+1 .\nThe only remaining case is when W has a unique vertex of degree 2m, whence\nW = K1,2m and Y = K2m . But |V (Y )| divides |L(K2m+1 )|. Since 2m does\nnot divide m(2m + 1), we conclude that L(K2m+1 ) is its own core.\nWe note that the edge set of L(K2m ) can be partitioned into 2m \u2212 1\nperfect matchings. It follows that the core of L(K2m ) is K2m\u22121 .\n9\n\n\f8\n\nq-Kneser Graphs\n\nLet V be a set of size v. The vertices of the Kneser graph Kv:k are the\nk-subsets of V and two k-subsets are adjacent if they are disjoint. The\nErd\u0151s-Ko-Rado\ntheorem asserts that an independent set in Kv:k has size at\n\u0001\nv\u22121\nmost k\u22121\n, and that an independent set of this size consists of the k-subsets\nthat contain a fixed element of V .\nWe consider an analogous class of graphs. Let V be a vector space of\ndimension v over the field of order q. The vertices of the q-Kneser graph are\nthe k-subspaces of V , and two k-subspaces are adjacent if their intersection is\nthe zero subspace. We denote this graph by qKv:k . Our aim is to determine\nthe independent sets of maximum size in qKv:k .\nLet q be a fixed positive integer. We define\n[n] :=\n\nqn \u2212 1\n.\nq\u22121\n\nWe then define [n]! inductively by setting [0]! = 1 and\n[n + 1]! := [n + 1][n]!.\nWith this in hand we define the q-binomial coefficient\n\u0014 \u0015\n[v]!\nv\n:=\n.\nk\n[k]![v \u2212 k]!\n\n\u0002v \u0003\nk\n\nby\n\n\u0002\u0003\nOne reason the q-binomial coefficient is important is that kv is the number\nk-dimensional subspaces of a v-dimensional vector space over a field with q\nelements.\nSuppose V is a vector space of dimension v over a field with q elements.\nLet W1,k (v) be the 01-matrix with rows indexed by the 1-dimensional subspaces, columns by the k-dimensional subspaces of V and with ij-entry equal\nto 1 if and only if the i-th subspace of dimension\u0002 1\u0003 is contained in the j-th\nsubspace of dimension k. Thus W1,k (v) is a [v] by kv matrix. It is a standard\nresult that the rows of W1,k (v) are linearly independent. (See, e.g., [9].) The\nrows of W1,k (v) are characteristic vectors of independent sets, namely the\nk-spaces that contain a given 1-dimensional subspace.\n8.1 Lemma. If v \u2265 2k, the maximum size of an independent set in qKv:k is\n\u0015\n\u0014\nv\u22121\n.\nk\u22121\n10\n\n\fIf S is an independent set of this size, its characteristic vector lies in the\ncolumn space of W1,k (v)T .\nProof. The least eigenvalue \u03c4 of qKv:k is\n\u0015\n\u0014\nk(k\u22121) v \u2212 k \u2212 1\n,\n\u2212q\nk\u22121\nand the corresponding eigenspace has dimension [v] \u2212 1. This can be read off\nthe matrix of eigenvalues of the Johnson scheme, which is given in [3]. The\nvalency of qKv:k is\n\u0015\n\u0014\nk2 v \u2212 k\nq\nk\nand hence the ratio bound applied to qKv:k yields that\n\u0015\n\u0014\nv\u22121\n.\n\u03b1(qKv:k ) \u2264\nk\u22121\nIt follows that the rows of W1,k (v) are characteristic vectors of independent sets from qKv:k with maximal size. Now rk(W1,k (v)) = [v] and 1T lies\nin the row space of W1,k (v). Therefore the subspace of the column space of\nW1,k (v)T orthogonal to 1 is the eigenspace of qKv:k with eigenvalue \u03c4 , and\nso the lemma follows.\nThe following result is due to Hsieh [8] (his proof does not cover the case\nv = 2k + 1, q = 2). Our proof is new, and considerably simpler. It is related\nto the methods of Frankl and Wilson [5], but they do not give a proof of the\ncharacterization.\n8.2 Theorem. If v > 2k, then an independent set of maximum size in qKv:k\nconsists of the k-subspaces of V that contain a given 1-dimensional subspace\nof V .\nProof. Let M denote W1,k (v)T and let z be the characteristic vector of an\nindependent set S in qKv:k with maximal size. Then z lies in the column\nspace of M, and therefore there is a vector h such that\nz = Mh\nIf \u03b1 is a k-subspace in S and \u03b2 is k-subspace such that \u03b2 \u2229 \u03b1 = 0, then \u03b2 \u2208\n/S\nand z\u03b2 = 0. Hence M\u03b2 h = 0 for all k-subspaces \u03b2 skew to \u03b1.\n11\n\n\fLet B be a complement to the k-subspace \u03b1, and let MB be the submatrix\nof M formed by the rows M\u03b2 , where \u03b2 \u2286 B. The columns of MB corresponding to the 1-dimensional subspaces not in B are zero; the non-zero columns\nform the matrix W1,k (v \u2212 k)T , and therefore they are linearly independent.\nSince MB h = 0, it follows that the entries of h indexed by the 1-dimensional\nsubspaces of B must all be zero. Our choice of the complement B was arbitrary, and consequently the entries of h indexed by a 1-dimensional subspace\nnot in \u03b1 are zero. Therefore the support of h consists of 1-dimensional subspaces of \u03b1 and so the k-subspaces in S have a 1-dimensional subspace in\ncommon.\nIt is not difficult to modify the above argument to obtain a proof of the\nErd\u0151s-Ko-Rado theorem. The resulting proof is similar in its underlying\nideas to the original proof by Wilson in [12].\n\n9\n\nThe Witt Graph on 77 Vertices\n\nLet D be the well-known 3-(22, 6, 1) design, with 77 blocks. The Witt graph\nW has the 77 blocks of this design as its vertices; two blocks are adjacent if\nthey are disjoint. There are 21 blocks on each point of the design, and thus\nwe find 22 independent sets of size 21. The Witt graph is strongly regular,\nwith eigenvalues and multiplicities\n(\u22126)(21) ,\n\n2(55) ,\n\n16(1) .\n\nThe ratio bound yields\n\u03b1(W ) \u2264\n\n77\n= 21.\n1 + 16\n6\n\nThus the independent sets given above have maximum size. We aim to show\nthat these are all the independent sets of maximum size in the graph.\nLet M be the 77 \u00d7 22 matrix with the characteristic vectors of our 22\nindependent sets as its columns. (So M T is the usual incidence matrix of\nthe design.) Each pair of distinct points lies in exactly five blocks and consequently\nM T M = 16I22 + 5J22 ,\nwhich is invertible. Therefore rk(M) = 22. Each column of\nM\u2212\n\n3\nJ\n11\n\n12\n\n\fis an eigenvector for W , and the columns of this matrix span the eigenspace\nwith eigenvalue \u22126. We conclude that if x is the characteristic vector of an\nindependent set of size 21, it lies in the column space of M.\nSuppose x contains the block \u03b1, that is, x\u03b1 = 1 and assume x = Mh.\nIf \u03b2 is a block disjoint from \u03b1, then x\u03b2 = 0. Let M1 be the submatrix of\nM formed by the rows corresponding to the blocks disjoint from \u03b1. Then\nM1 h = 0. Now M1 is 16 \u00d7 22\n\u0001\nM1 = 0 N ,\n\nwhere N is 16 \u00d7 16. We show that N is the incidence matrix of a 2-(16, 6, 2)design, whence it follows that N is invertible.\nLet \u03b1 be a block of the Witt design and suppose x, y are two points not\nin \u03b1. There are five blocks that contain x and y and, since any two distinct\nblocks have at most two points in common, these five blocks partition the 20\npoints other than x and y. It follows that three of these five blocks meet \u03b1 in\ntwo points, and the remaining pair of blocks are disjoint from \u03b1. Hence the\nblocks disjoint from \u03b1 form a 2-design on 16 points with block size six and\nwith \u03bb = 2. From this we deduce that there are exactly 16 blocks disjoint\nfrom \u03b1 and so N is the incidence matrix of a symmetric design.\nTherefore N is invertible and so it follows that supp(h) \u2286 \u03b1. Therefore\neach block in supp(x) contains supp(h), and consequently these 21 blocks\nhave a point in common.\nSince the Witt graph is the graph induced by the vertices not adjacent to\na given vertex in the Higman-Sims graph, our result leads to a determination\nof all independent sets of size 22 in the Higman-Sims graph. It is well known\nthat the maximal independent sets of the Witt graph are as shown above:\nsee for example [4], where the maximal independent sets in the Higman-Sims\ngraph are determined by computer. However our proof is new and gives\nfurther evidence that our method has a wide range of application.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. E. Brouwer, A. M. Cohen, and A. Neumaier.\nGraphs.
