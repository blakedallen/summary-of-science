The nonlinear\npart of the conductance, which is due to the interaction of electrons with\nmagnetic impurities is obtained. The analytical results have been analyzed\nnumerically. It is shown that intensity of the Kondo anomaly in the conductance as the function of the applied voltage depends on the diameter of the\nconstriction and the positions of impurities.\n\nThe impurity-electron interaction in Kondo systems can be effectively studied by using\nthe point contacts (PC). In first measurements of the differential PC resistance R(V ) in\nmetals with magnetic impurities the zero-bias Kondo anomaly had been observed [1\u20133].\nThese experiments were explained by quasiclassical theory of Kondo effect in PC's [4]. It\nwas shown that in second-order Born approximation the magnetic impurity contribution to\nthe PC resistance includes the logarithmic dependence R(V ) \u223c ln (V ) for eV \u226b TK and\n1\n\n\fthe saturation for eV \u226a TK (TK is the Kondo temperature, V is the voltage applied to the\nPC). In accordance to the theory [4], the nonlinear correction to the ballistic PC resistance\nis proportional to the contact diameter. But in the experiments [1\u20133] the size dependence\nof the PC current was not investigated due to the limited range of contact diameters, which\nwere accessible.\nThe development of the technique of mechanically controllable break junctions (MCBJ)\nhas made it possible to create the stable PC's, with the diameter adjustable over broad\nrange, down to a single atom [5,6]. In the MCBJ experiments [7,8] authors had studied the\nresistance of ultrasmall contacts with magnetic impurities as function of the PC diameter d.\nIn the contrast to the prediction of the quasiclassical theory [4] Yanson at el. [7,8] observed\nthat Kondo scattering contribution to the contact resistance is nearly independent from the\ncontact diameter d for small d. Such behavior authors [7,8] had explained by the increasing\nof Kondo impurity scattering cross-section with decreasing of contact size.\nIn theoretical works [9] it was shown that in very small contacts the discreteness of\nimpurity positions must be taken into account, and experiments [7,8] may be explained by\nthe \"classical\" mesoscopic effect of the dependence of the point contact conductance on\nthe spatial distribution of impurities. This effect is essential in the \"short\" contacts and\nin the quasiclassical approximation it disappears with the increasing of the contact length.\nZarand and Udvardi [10] had considered the contact in the in the form of a long channel and\nsuggested that the Kondo temperature TK is changed due to the strong the local density\nof states fluctuations generated by the reflections of conduction electrons at the surface of\nthe contact. As a result of that, the effective cross section of electrons has the maximum,\nif the position of the impurity inside the contact corresponds to the maximum in the local\nelectron density of states. But the mesoscopic effect of the spatial distribution of impurities\nin quantum contacts was not analyzed in the paper [10].\nIn ultrasmall contacts the quantum phenomena, which are known as quantum size effect,\noccur. The effect of the 2e2 /h conductance quantization has been observed in experiments on\ncontacts in the two-dimensional electron gas [11,12] and in the ultrasmall three-dimensional\n2\n\n\fconstrictions, which is created by using the scanning tunnel microscopy [13,14] and mechanically controllable break junctions [15]. The defects produce the backscattering of electrons,\nand thus break the quantization of the conductance. From the other hand, the impurities\nsituated inside the quantum microconstriction produce the nonlinear dependence of the conductance on the applied voltage [18]. This dependence is the result of the interference of\nelectron waves reflected by these defects [16,17].\nIn this paper we present the theoretical solution of this problem for the conductance\nof a quantum microconstriction in the form of the long ballistic channel , which contains\nsingle magnetic impurities. The study is made of the first and second order corrections to\nthe conductance of the ballistic microconstriction in the Born approximation. The effect of\nimpurity positions is taken into account. Within the framework of the model of the long\nchannel the quantum formula for the conductance G is obtained. By using the model of the\ncylindrical microconstriction, the nonlinear conductance as a function of voltage V and the\nwidth of constriction d is analyzed numerically for different positions of a single impurity.\nLet us consider the quantum microconstriction in the form of a long and perfectly clean\nchannel with smooth boundaries and a diameter d comparable with the Fermi wave length\n\u221a\n\u03bbF = h/ 2m\u03b5F , where \u03b5F is the Fermi energy. We assume that this channel is smoothly\n(over Fermi length scale) connected with a bulk metal banks. As it was shown [20,21], in\nsuch constriction in the zeroth approximation on the adiabatic parameter |\u2207d| \u226a 1 accurate\nquantization can be obtained. The corrections to the tunneling and reflection coefficients\nof electrons due to deviation from the adiabatic constriction are exponentially small, except\nnear the points where the modes are switched on and off [22].\nWhen a voltage V is applied to the constriction, a net current start to flow. In the limit\nV \u2192 0, the ballistic conductance of the quantum microconstriction is given by the formula\nG=\n\nX\ndJ\n= G0\nfF (\u03b5\u03b2 ) ,\ndV\n\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fF is the Fermi function, \u03b5\u03b2 is the minimal energy of the transverse electron mode, \u03b2 is\nthe full set of transverse discrete quantum numbers. The ballistic quantum PC displays the\n3\n\n\fspecific nonlinear properties, such as the conductance jumps e2 /h. For the two dimensional\nPC these effects was considered in the papers [23,24]. The aim of this study is to analyze\nthe zero bias Kondo minimum in the PC conductance. We assume that the bias eV is\nmuch smaller not only the Fermi energy \u03b5F , but also the distances between the energies\n\u03b5\u03b2 of quantum modes. In this case the effect of the influence of the applied bias to the\ntransmission is negligibly small.\nImpurities and defects scatter the electrons that leads to the decreasing of the transmission probability. In accordance with the standard procedure [25,26] the decreasing of the\nelectrical current \u2206I due to the electron-impurity interaction connects with the velocity of\nthe energy E dissipation by the relation:\n\n\u2206IV =\n\ndE\nd hH1 i\n=\n;\ndt\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the electrons H contains the following terms:.\n\nH = H0 + H1 + Hint ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nH0 =\n\nX\n\n\u03b5k c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3\n\n(4)\n\nk,\u03c3\n\nis Hamiltonian of free electrons,\n\nH1 =\n\neV X\nsign(vz )c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3\n2 k,\u03c3\n\n(5)\n\ndescribes the interaction of electrons with electric field.

The second addition I2 is also small too, but contains the Kondo\n6\n\n\flogarithmic dependence on the voltage, and it is most important for the analysis of the\nnonlinear conductance of constrictions with magnetic impurities.\nThe expressions (15) and (16) can be further simplified in the case of \u03b4\u2212potential of\nimpurities\n\nJ (r) = J\u03b4 (r)\n\n(17)\n\nIn this case the addition I2 to the ballistic current has the form:\n\nI2 =\n\nXX\n2J 3 \u03c0e\ns(s + 1)\n(sign vzk \u2212 sign vzn )\n~\n\n(18)\n\nn,m,k i,j,l\n\n[\u03b4(\u03b5n \u2212 \u03b5k ) Pr\n\n1\n1\n+ \u03b4(\u03b5m \u2212 \u03b5k ) Pr\n]\n\u03b5m \u2212 \u03b5k\n\u03b5n \u2212 \u03b5k\n\nRe[\u03c6\u2217k (rj )\u03c6\u2217n (ri )\u03c6\u2217m (rl )\u03c6k (rl )\u03c6m (ri )\u03c6n (rj )]\n[2fn (fk \u2212 fm ) + (fm \u2212 fk )],\nAs it follows from the Eqs.(16), (18), the current I2 depends from the positions of impurities. Two effects influence by value I2 : the effect of quantum interference of scattered\nelectron waves, which depends from the distances between impurities, and effect of the electron density of states in the points, where the impurities are situated. The nonlinear part\nof the conductance can be easy obtained after differentiation the Eq.18 over the voltage\nG2 = dI2 /dV. In the case of a single impurity and at zero temperature T = 0 this equation can be analytically integrated over momentum pz and the conductance G2 takes the\nfollowing form:\nh\ni\u22121\nXX\n\u03c0e2 m3e 3\n2\n2\n2\n(\u03ba) (\u03ba) (\u03ba)\nJ\ns(s\n+\n1)\n|\u03c8\n(R)|\n|\u03c8\n(R)|\n|\u03c8\n(R)|\np\np\np\n*\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\n~4\n\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 \u03ba=\u00b1\n!\n\"\n(\u03ba) (\u2212\u03ba)\n(\u2212\u03ba) (\u03ba)\n(\u03ba)\n(\u03ba)\n(\u2212\u03ba)\np\u03b1 p\u03b2 \u2212 p\u03b1 p\u03b2\np\u03b1\np\u03b3 \u2212 p\u03b3\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ) ln (\u03ba) (\u2212\u03ba)\n+\nln (\u03ba)\n(\u2212\u03ba)\n(\u03ba)\n(\u2212\u03ba) (\u03ba)\np\u03b3 + p\u03b3\np\u03b3\np\u03b1 p\u03b2 + p\u03b1 p\u03b2\n\u0010\n\u00112 \u0010\n\u00112 \uf8f9\n(\u03ba)\n(\u2212\u03ba)\np\u03b1\n\u2212 p\u03b1\n\uf8fa\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ln\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\uf8fb;\n(\u2212\u03ba)\np\u03b1\n\nG2 = \u2212\n\n7\n\n(19)\n\n\fwhere\np\u03b1(\u00b1)\n\n=\n\ns\n\n2me\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\neV\n\u2212 \u03b5\u03b1 ,\n\u03b5F \u00b1\n2\n\n(20)\n\nand the transverse parts of the wavefunction \u03c8\u03b1 (R) and the electron energy \u03b5\u03b1 are defined\nby Eqs. (8), (9).\nCarrying out the numerical calculations we use the free electron model of a point contact\nconsisting of two infinite half-spaces connected by a long ballistic cylinder of a radius R and\na length L (Fig.1). In a limit L \u2192 \u221e the electron wave functions \u03c6k (r) and eigenstates \u03b5k\ncan be written as\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u03c1\u0011\ni\n\u03c6k (r) = \u221a\nJm \u03b3mn\nexp im\u03c6 + pz z ;\nR\n~\n\u03a9Jm+1 (\u03b3mn )\n1\n\n\u03b5k = \u03b5mn +\n\np2z\n;\n2me\n\n\u03b5mn =\n\n~2\n\u03b32\n2me R2 mn\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nand cylindrical coordinates r = (\u03c1, \u03c6, z) with the axis z along the channel axis have been\nused. Here k = (n, m, pz ) are the quantum numbers, \u03a9 = \u03c0R2 L is the volume of the channel,\n\u03b3mn are the n-th zero of the Bessel function Jm . Because the degeneration of the electron\nenergy on azimuthal quantum number m ( as a result of the symmetry of the model),\nquantum modes with \u00b1m give the same contribution to the conductance. In this model the\nballistic conductance (1) has not only steps G0 , but also steps 2G0 [21,27].\nIn Fig.2 the dependence of the nonlinear conductance on the applied bias is shown\nfor the different positions of a single magnetic impurity inside the channel. The results\nobtained confirm that the nonlinear effect is strongly depend on the position of impurity.\nIf the impurity is situated near the surface of the constriction r = R, where the square\nmodule of the electron wave function is small, its influence to the conductivity is negligible.\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the calculations of the dependence G2 on the position of\nthe impurity for different number of quantum modes (Fig.3). Results indicate that the\n8\n\n\fmesoscopic effect of the impurity position is more essential for ultrasmall contacts, which\ncontain only few conducting modes, and G2 has a maximum. The similar results is obtained\nfor the dependence of G2 on the radius R of the constriction (Figs.4,5). In the single-mode\nconstriction (Fig.4) the conductance G2 displays much more stronger dependence on R, than\nin the contact with five conducting modes (Fig.5).\nThus, we have shown that in the long quantum microconstrictions the spatial distribution\nof magnetic impurities influences to the nonlinear dependence of the conductance on the\napplied voltage. This mesoscopic effect is due to the strong dependence the amplitude of\nan electron scattering on the positions of impurities. As a result of the reflection from the\nboundaries of the constriction the electron wave functions, which correspond to the finite\nelectron motion in the transverse to the contact axis direction, are the standing waves. If\nthe impurity is situated near the point, in which the electron wave function is equal to zero\n(near the surface of the constriction or, for quantum modes with numbers n > 1, in some\npoints inside), its scattering of electrons is small. The fact the amplitude of the Kondo\nminimum of the conductance of the quantum contact display the mesoscopic effect of the\ndependence on the positions of single impurities. This effect is most important in the case,\nwhen only few quantum modes are responsible on the conductivity of the constriction.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure captions.\nFig. 1.
