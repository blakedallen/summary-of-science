All compact groups considered\nin this article are assumed to be metrizable and all automorphisms are assumed to be\ncontinuous. Let K be a compact group and Aut (K) be the group of all continuous\nautomorphisms of K.\nDefinition 1 Let K be a compact group and \u03c9K be the normalized Haar measure\non K. Let \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of K. We say that \u0393 is ergodic on K if\nany \u0393-invariant Borel set A of K satisfies \u03c9K (A) = 0 or \u03c9K (A) = 1. We say that\n\u03b1 \u2208 Aut (K) is ergodic on K if the action of {\u03b1n | n \u2208 Z} on K is ergodic.\nErgodic action has been characterized in many forms, we now recall two such\ncharacterizations due to Berend (cf. Theorem 2.1 of [Be]): \u0393 is ergodic on K if and\nonly if there exists x \u2208 K such that the orbit \u0393(x) is dense in K if and only if\nfor any non-trivial irreducible unitary representation \u03c0, the orbit {\u03b1(\u03c0) | \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393} has\n1\n\n\finfinitely many inequivalent unitary representations where \u03b1(\u03c0) is given by \u03b1(\u03c0)(x) =\n\u03c0(\u03b1\u22121 (x)) for all x \u2208 K. Also, Berend [Be] proved the following result.\nBerend's Theorem: Ergodic action of a group \u0393 of commuting epimorphisms on a\ncompact connected finite-dimensional abelian group contains ergodic automorphisms.\nRecently Berend's Theorem was proved for certain hereditarily ergodic actions of\nsolvable groups on compact connected finite-dimensional abelian groups (cf. [BG])\nand for ergodic actions of nilpotent groups on compact connected finite-dimensional\nabelian groups (cf. [Ra]): this type of result was called a local to global correspondence in [Ra] as no \u03b1 in a group \u0393 is ergodic implies the whole group \u0393 is not ergodic.\nNo analogue of Berend's Theorem is known for actions on general compact groups.\nWe will now look at the following examples in this context.\nExample 1.1 Let M be a compact group and \u0393 be a countably infinite group. Then\nthe (left) shift action of \u0393 on M \u0393 is defined for \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 and f \u2208 M \u0393 , by\n\u03b1f (\u03b2) = f (\u03b1\u22121 \u03b2)\nfor all \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393. Then it can be seen that the shift action of \u0393 on M \u0393 is ergodic (cf.\n[Ra] when M is abelian). If \u0393 is a torsion group (for example, we may take \u0393 to be\nthe group of all finite permutations), then no element of \u0393 is ergodic. Thus, there are\nergodic actions without having any ergodic automorphisms.\nIf \u0393 is assumed to be a finitely generated solvable group, then \u0393 is torsion implies\n\u0393 is finite. Hence actions as in Example 1.1 does not exist if \u0393 is assumed to be a\nfinitely generated solvable group. However the following example shows that even if\nwe assume \u0393 to be finitely generated abelian, Berend's Theorem need not be true for\nany compact group.\nExample 1.2 Let M be a compact group with an ergodic automorphisms \u03c4 . For any\n(i, j) \u2208 Z2 \\ (0, 0), define Ki,j = M with Z2 -action defined\nby (n, m) 7\u2192 \u03c4 mi\u2212nj and\nQ\n2\ndefine K0,0 = M Z with shift action of Z2 . Let K = i,j Ki,j and define coordinatewise Z2 -action on K. Then it can be verified that this action is faithful, that is no\nnon-zero (n, m) acts trivially on K. We first claim that Z2 -action on K is ergodic.\nIt is sufficient to claim that Z2 -action on each Ki,j is ergodic. Let (i, j) \u2208 Z2 \\ (0, 0).\nSince \u03c4 is ergodic on M, if j 6= 0, then (i + 1, j) whose action on Ki,j is by \u03c4 \u2212j is\nergodic on Ki,j and if i 6= 0, then (i, j + 1) whose action on Ki,j is by \u03c4 i is ergodic on\n2\nKi,j . We know that the shift action of Z2 on K0,0 = M Z is ergodic. Thus, Z2 -action\non K is ergodic.\nWe next claim that no element (i, j) of Z2 is ergodic on K. It is clear that (0, 0)\nis not ergodic on K. Now take any (i, j) \u2208 Z2 \\ (0, 0). Now, (i, j)-action on Ki,j is\n2\n\n\fgiven by \u03c4 ji\u2212ij , identity. That is, (i, j) is not ergodic on Ki,j . Since Ki,j is a factor of\nK, we get that (i, j) is not ergodic on K. Thus, no (n, m) \u2208 Z2 is ergodic on K.\nIn the above example the Z2 -action on the compact group has infinitely many\ninvariant normal subgroups resulting in infinite chain of closed normal invariant subgroups. Motivated by example 1.2 we are lead to consider the following type of\nactions.\nDefinition 2 Action of a group \u0393 on a compact group K is said to have descending\nchain condition (abbr. as DCC) if any decreasing sequence (Ki )i\u22651 of \u0393-invariant\nclosed subgroups is finite, that is, there exists a n \u2265 1 such that Kn = Kn+i for all i.\nThe condition DCC was studied in the context of ergodic actions and other type of\ngroup actions (cf. [KS]). Kitchens and Schmidt [KS] proved that action of countable\nabelian groups is a projective limit of actions having DCC and action of a finitely\ngenerated abelian group \u0393 on a compact group K has DCC if and only if K is\nisomorphic to a shift-invariant subgroup of M \u0393 for some compact real Lie group M\n(cf. Theorems 3.2 and 3.16 of [KS]): see Example 1.1 for definition of the shift action\nof \u0393 on M \u0393Q\n. It can be easily seen that K and \u0393 in Example 1.2 does not satisfy DCC:\ntake Kn = i+j\u2265n Ki+j , (Kn ) is a decreasing sequence of closed (normal) \u0393-invariant\nsubgroups but Kn 6= Km for all n 6= m.\nSchmidt [Sc1] proved that if \u0393 is a finitely generated abelian group of automorphisms of a compact abelian group K such that \u0393 has DCC on K, then \u0393 is ergodic\non K if and only if \u0393 contains ergodic automorphisms (cf. Theorem 3.3 and Corollary\n3.4 of [Sc1]).\nWe now introduce center of actions. If a group \u0393 acts on a compact group K,\nthen center of the action denoted by Z(\u0393) is defined to be Z(\u0393) = {\u03b1 \u2208 Aut (K) |\n\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b2\u03b1 for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393}. If \u0393 is generated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n \u2208 \u0393 we may write\nZ(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n ) instead of Z(\u0393).\nIn this article we study ergodic actions on compact groups and prove that ergodic\nactions of finitely generated abelian groups on compact groups contain ergodic automorphisms, hence extending Berend's Theorem provided that center of the action\nhas DCC. Since a finitely generated abelian group \u0393 has a subgroup \u0393 of finite index\nisomorphic to Zd for some d \u2265 0 and \u0393 is ergodic if and only if any subgroup of finite\nindex is ergodic, our results are about ergodic Zd -actions.\nWe provide examples of compact groups where the center of certain type of automorphisms have DCC, as a consequence ergodic actions of finitely generated abelian\ngroups of automorphisms of such type contain ergodic automorphisms. This in particular, retrieves Berend's Theorem quoted above and Theorem 3.3 of Schmidt [Sc1]\nwhich explains that the condition on center of the action is not restrictive.\nWe will now see certain type of action which is needed for our purpose.\n3\n\n\fDefinition 3 We say that the action of a group \u0393 on a compact group K is distal if\nfor any x \u2208 K \\ (e), e is not in the closure of the orbit \u0393(x) = {\u03b1(x) | \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393}. We\nsay that \u03b1 \u2208 Aut (K) is distal on K if the action of {\u03b1n | n \u2208 Z} on K is distal.\nDistal actions were studied by many in different contexts (cf. [El], [Fu] and [Ra]).\nAs in [Ra] distality plays a useful role in our proofs. It is a well-known interesting fact\nthat if \u0393 is distal on K, then \u0393 is distal on K/L for any \u0393-invariant normal subgroup\nL of K (cf. [El]) and we quote this result as we use this result often without quoting.\n\n2\n\nErgodic actions\n\nIn this section we prove a few basic results on ergodic actions that are needed for our\npurpose and we provide a proof of these results as we could not locate these results\nin the literature.\nLet K be a compact group. If \u03c0 is a continuous unitary representation of K, then\nfor any automorphism \u03b1 of K, \u03b1\u03c0 is defined by\n\u03b1\u03c0(x) = \u03c0(\u03b1\u22121 (x))\nfor all x \u2208 K. It can be easily seen that if \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 are equivalent unitary representations, then \u03b1(\u03c0) and \u03b1(\u03c0 \u2032 ) are equivalent. Let [\u03c0] be denote the equivalent class of\nunitary representations containing \u03c0. Define \u03b1[\u03c0] = [\u03b1(\u03c0)] for any automorphism \u03b1\non K and any unitary representation \u03c0 of K. Let K\u0302 be denote the equivalent classes\nof continuous irreducible unitary representations of K. Then (\u03b1, [\u03c0]) 7\u2192 \u03b1[\u03c0] = [\u03b1(\u03c0)]\ndefines an action of Aut (K) on K\u0302 and this action is known as the dual action.\nWe now extend Berend's criterion Theorem 2.1 of [Be] to finite-dimensional unitary representations.\nLemma 2.1 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of K.\nThen the following are equivalent:\n(i) \u0393 is ergodic on K;\n(ii) \u0393[\u03c0] is infinite for any non-trivial [\u03c0] \u2208 K\u0302;\n(iii) \u0393[\u03c0] is infinite for any non-trivial finite-dimensional unitary representation \u03c0\nof K.\nProof Equivalence of (i) and (ii) is proved in Theorem 2.1 of [Be] and since all irreducible unitary representation of compact groups are finite-dimensional, (iii) implies\n(ii). So, it is sufficient to prove that (ii) implies (iii). Let \u03c0 be a finite-dimensional\n4\n\n\funitary representation of K such that \u0393[\u03c0] is finite. Let \u03931 be the subgroup of \u0393\nconsisting of all \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03b1(\u03c0) is equivalent to \u03c0. Then \u03931 is a subgroup of\nfinite index.\nr\nLet \u03c0 = \u22951\u2264j\u2264m \u03c0j j be the decomposition of \u03c0 into irreducible unitary representations \u03c0j of K. Then for any automorphism \u03b1 of K, \u03b1(\u03c0) = \u22951\u2264j\u2264m \u03b1(\u03c0j )rj and\neach \u03b1(\u03c0j ) is also irreducible. By uniqueness of decomposition, each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03931 , defines\na permutation on the set of equivalent classes of \u03c0j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m (cf. 27.30 of [HR2]).\nThus, there is a subgroup \u03932 of finite index in \u03931 such that \u03b1(\u03c0j ) is equivalent to \u03c0j\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03932 and all j. Since \u03931 has finite index in \u0393 and \u03932 has finite index in \u03931 ,\nwe get that \u03932 has finite index in \u0393. Using (ii) this implies that each \u03c0j is trivial and\nhence \u03c0 is trivial. Thus, (ii) implies (iii) is proved.\nThe following shows stage ergodicity implying ergodicity.\nLemma 2.2 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of K.\nSuppose there is a decreasing sequence (Ki )i\u22650 of closed \u0393-invariant subgroups with\nK0 = K and \u2229Ki = (e) such that Ki is normal in Ki\u22121 and \u0393 is ergodic on Ki\u22121 /Ki .\nThen \u0393 is ergodic on K.\nProof Let \u03c0 be an irreducible unitary representation of K such that \u0393[\u03c0] is finite.\nThen \u03c0 is finite-dimensional. Suppose \u03c0 is trivial on Ki . Then let \u03c0\u0303 be the restriction\nof \u03c0 to Ki\u22121 . Then \u03c0\u0303 is a unitary representation of Ki\u22121 /Ki of finite-dimension and\n\u0393[\u03c0\u0303] is finite. Since \u0393 is ergodic on Ki\u22121 /Ki , it follows from Lemma 2.1 that \u03c0\u0303 is\ntrivial. Thus, \u03c0 is trivial on Ki\u22121 if \u03c0 is trivial on Ki and hence it is sufficient to\nclaim that \u03c0 is trivial on some Ki .\nSince \u03c0 is finite-dimensional, there exists n \u2265 1 such that \u03c0(K) is a compact and\nhence a closed subgroup of GLn (C). Then by Cartan's Theorem \u03c0(K) is a real Lie\ngroup (cf. Part II, Chapter V, Section 9, [Se]). Since each Ki is compact, we get that\n(\u03c0(Ki )) is a decreasing sequence of closed subgroups of \u03c0(K). Considering dimension\nand using the fact that compact real Lie groups have only finitely many connected\ncomponents, we get that there exists i0 such that \u03c0(Ki ) = Ki0 for all i \u2265 i0 . Since\n\u2229Ki = (e), \u03c0(Ki ) is trivial for all i \u2265 i0 . Thus, \u03c0 is trivial on Ki0 .\nLemma 2.3 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of K.\nSuppose there exists a collection (Ki )i\u2208I of closed \u0393-invariant subgroups K such that\n\u222ai\u2208I Ki = K and \u0393 is ergodic on Ki for all i \u2208 I. Then \u0393 is ergodic on K.\nProof Let \u03c0 be an irreducible unitary representation of K such that \u0393[\u03c0] is finite.\nFor i \u2208 I, let \u03c0i be the restriction of \u03c0 to Ki . Then \u03c0i is a finite-dimensional unitary\nrepresentation of Ki and \u0393[\u03c0i ] is finite for all i \u2208 I. Since \u0393 is ergodic on Ki , by\nLemma 2.1, we get that \u03c0i is trivial and hence \u03c0 is trivial on Ki for all i \u2208 I. Since\n\u222aKi = K, \u03c0 is trivial on K.\n5\n\n\fLemma 2.4 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of K.\nSuppose there exist subgroups \u03931 and \u03932 of \u0393 such that \u03932 is a compact normal subgroup of \u0393 and \u0393 = \u03931 \u03932 . Then we have the following:\n(i) \u03932 [\u03c0] is finite for any irreducible unitary representation \u03c0 of K;\n(ii) \u0393 is ergodic on K if and only if \u03931 is ergodic on K.\nProof Let \u03c0 be an irreducible unitary representation of K. Let H be the Hilbert\nspace on which \u03c0 is defined. Let n be the dimension of H. Let Rn be the space of\nall irreducible unitary representations of K of dimension n and An be the equivalent\nclasses of irreducible unitary representations of K of dimension n. Equip Rn with the\nsmallest topology for which the functions \u03c0 7\u2192< \u03c0(x)u, v > are continuous on Rn for\nall x \u2208 K and all u, v \u2208 H. Consider the quotient map \u03c0 7\u2192 [\u03c0] of Rn onto An and\nequip An with the quotient topology from Rn . It is well-known that An is discrete\n(cf. 3.5.8 and 18.4.3 of [Di]). Let \u03b1n \u2192 \u03b1 in Aut (K). Then for x \u2208 K and u, v \u2208 H,\nwe have\n< \u03b1n \u03c0(x)u, v >=< \u03c0(\u03b1n\u22121 x)u, v >\u2192< \u03c0(\u03b1\u22121 x)u, v >=< \u03b1\u03c0(x)u, v >\nas \u03c0 is continuous and \u03b1n\u22121 (x) \u2192 \u03b1\u22121 (x). Thus, \u03b1n [\u03c0] \u2192 \u03b1[\u03c0] in An . Since \u03932 is\ncompact, we get that \u03932 [\u03c0] is compact in An . Since An is discrete, \u03932 [\u03c0] is finite.\nThus, proving (i).\nSuppose \u0393 is ergodic on K. If \u03c0 is an irreducible unitary representation of K such\nthat \u03931 [\u03c0] is finite, then since \u03932 is normal, (i) implies that \u0393[\u03c0] = \u03932 \u03931 [\u03c0] is finite.\nSince \u0393 is ergodic, \u03c0 is trivial. Thus, \u03931 is ergodic. This proves (ii).\nWe next prove the existence of largest ergodic subgroup for \u0393-actions.\nProposition 2.1 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms of\nK. Then there is a Z(\u0393)-invariant (largest) closed normal subgroup L of K such that\n\u0393 is ergodic on L and \u0393 is distal on K/L.\nProof Let A be the collection of all closed normal \u0393-invariant subgroups L such\nthat \u0393 is ergodic on L and elements of A are ordered by inclusion. Since the trivial\nsubgroup is in A, A is non-empty. Let B be a chain in A. Let M = \u222aL\u2208B L. Since\nB is a chain, M is a closed normal \u0393-invariant subgroup of K. By Lemma 2.3, \u0393 is\nergodic on M and hence M \u2208 A and L \u2282 M for all L \u2208 B. Thus, every chain in\nA has upper bound. By Zorn's Lemma A has a maximal element and let N be the\nmaximal element of A.\nLet Inn (K) be the group of all inner automorphisms of K. Then Inn (K) is a\ncompact normal subgroup of Aut (K). Let \u0393\u0303 be the group generated by \u0393 and all\n6\n\n\finner automorphisms of K. Then N is \u0393\u0303-invariant and \u0393\u0303 = \u0393Inn (K). Suppose \u00d1\nis a closed \u0393\u0303-invariant subgroup of K containing N such that \u0393\u0303 is ergodic on \u00d1 /N.\nSince \u0393 is ergodic on N and \u0393 \u2282 \u0393\u0303, \u0393\u0303 is ergodic on N. Thus, \u0393\u0303 is ergodic on \u00d1 (cf.\nLemma 2.2). Now Lemma 2.4 implies that \u0393 is ergodic on \u00d1 . Since \u00d1 is \u0393\u0303-invariant,\n\u00d1 is normal in K and hence \u00d1 \u2208 A and N \u2282 \u00d1. Since N is a maximal element in\nA, N = \u00d1. By Proposition 2.1 of [Ra], we get that \u0393\u0303 is distal on K/N. Since \u0393 \u2282 \u0393\u0303,\n\u0393 is distal on K/N.\nLet \u03b2 \u2208 Z(\u0393). Since \u0393 is ergodic on N, by Theorem 2.1 of [Be], there exists a\nx \u2208 N such that \u0393(x) is dense in N. So, there exists a sequence (\u03b1n ) in \u0393 such that\n\u03b1n (x) \u2192 e. Now \u03b1n (\u03b2(x)) = \u03b2\u03b1n (x) \u2192 e. Since \u0393 is distal on K/N, \u03b2(x) \u2208 N. Since\nN is \u0393-invariant, this implies that \u03b2(\u03b1(x)) = \u03b1(\u03b2(x)) \u2208 \u03b1(N) = N for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393.\nSince \u0393(x) is dense in N, \u03b2(N) \u2282 N. Thus, N is Z(\u0393)-invariant.\nIf H is a closed \u0393-invariant subgroup of K such that \u0393 is ergodic on H, then since\nN is normal in K, HN is also a closed \u0393-invariant subgroup and hence \u0393 is ergodic on\nthe closed subgroup HN (cf. Lemma 2.2). This implies that \u0393 is ergodic on HN/N\nbut \u0393 is distal on K/N and hence distal on HN/N. Thus, N = HN \u2283 H.\n\n3\n\nDistal actions\n\nIn this section we prove that distality of generating elements is sufficient for distality\nof finitely generated abelian group actions on compact groups which is needed for our\npurpose and which may be of independent interest.\nWe first consider zero-dimensional compact groups. It may be noted that a compact group is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected (see 3.5 and\n7.7 of [HR1]).\nLemma 3.1 Let \u0393 be a finitely generated abelian group of automorphisms of a compact zero-dimensional group K. Suppose \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1m \u2208 \u0393 generate \u0393. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) \u0393 action on K is distal;\n(ii) \u03b1i is distal on K for i = 1, 2, * * * , m;\n(iii) K has arbitrarily small \u0393-invariant compact open subgroups.\nProof It is sufficient to prove that (ii) implies (iii). We prove (iii) by induction on\nthe number of generators of \u0393. If \u0393 has only one generator, the result follows from\nProposition 2.1 of [JR] (see also [BW]). If m > 1, then by induction assumption, for\nany compact open subgroup W of K, there exists a compact open subgroup U \u2282 W\n7\n\n\fthat is invariant under \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n\u22121 . By Proposition 2.1 of [JR], there exists a\nk such that \u2229ki=0 \u03b1ni (U) is \u03b1n -invariant. Let V = \u2229ki=0 \u03b1ni (U). Then V is invariant\nunder \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n\u22121 as \u03b1i s commute and V is invariant under \u03b1n also, hence V is\ninvariant under the group generated by \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n which is \u0393. Thus,\nproving (iii).\nWe next consider abelian groups and we recall a few results on duality of locally\ncompact abelian groups. Let G be a locally compact abelian group. Then any continuous homomorphism of G into the circle group {z \u2208 C | |z| = 1} is known as\ncharacter of G. Let \u011c be the group of characters on G. Then \u011c with compact-open\ntopology is known as the dual group of G. It is well-known that \u011c is discrete if and\nd\nonly if G is compact, (\u011c) \u2243 G, and G is metrizable if and only if \u011c is \u03c3-compact (cf.\nTheorems 12, 23 and 29 of [Mo]). Thus, K is a compact (metrizable) abelian group\nif and only if K\u0302 is a countable discrete group.\nFor any closed subgroup M of G, consider the subgroup M \u22a5 of \u011c defined by\n\u22a5\nM = {\u03c7 \u2208 \u011c | \u03c7 is trivial on M}. It follows from Pontryagin duality theory that\n\\ (cf. Theorem 27 of [Mo]).\nM\u0302 \u2243 \u011c/M \u22a5 and M \u22a5 \u2243 (G/M)\nFor any bi-continuous automorphism \u03b1 of G and \u03c7 \u2208 \u011c, we define \u03b1\u03c7 by \u03b1\u03c7(g) =\n\u03c7(\u03b1\u22121 (g)) for all g \u2208 G and hence \u03c7 7\u2192 \u03b1\u03c7 defines a bi-continuous automorphism\nof \u011c which would be called dual automorphism of \u03b1. Also, (\u03b1, \u03c7) 7\u2192 \u03b1\u03c7 defines an\naction of Aut (G) on \u011c and it is known as the dual action.\nWe now apply duality theory of compact abelian groups to obtain the following.\nLemma 3.2 Let K be a compact abelian group and \u0393 be a group of automorphisms\nof K. Suppose there is compact normal subgroup \u2206 of \u0393 and \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n are in \u0393 such\nthat \u0393/\u2206 is abelian and \u0393 is generated by \u2206 and \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n . Then the following are\nequivalent:\n1. \u0393 is distal on K;\n2. each \u03b1i is distal on K.\nProof Assume that each \u03b1i is distal on K. Proof is based on induction on n.\nSuppose L is a non-trivial \u0393-invariant subgroup of K. Let A be the dual of L. Let\n\u03931 be the group generated by \u2206 and \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n\u22121 . Then by induction hypothesis, \u03931\nis distal on K and hence the subgroup A1 = {\u03c7 \u2208 A | \u03931 (\u03c7) is finite } is non-trivial\n(cf. Proposition 2.1 of [Ra]). Since \u0393/\u2206 is abelian and \u03931 contains \u2206, we get that\n\u03b1n normalizes \u03931 and hence A1 is \u03b1n -invariant. Since \u03b1n is distal on K, there is a\nnon-trivial \u03c7 \u2208 A1 such that \u03b1nm (\u03c7) = \u03c7 for some m 6= 0 (cf. Proposition 2.1 of [Ra]).\ni\nThis implies that \u03931 \u03b1nj (\u03c7) \u2282 \u222am\ni=1 \u03931 (\u03b1n (\u03c7)) for all j and hence since \u03c7 \u2208 A1 and A1\n8\n\n\fis \u03b1n -invariant, the orbit \u0393(\u03c7) is finite. Thus, \u0393 is not ergodic on L. It follows from\nProposition 2.1 of [Ra] that \u0393 is distal on K.\nWe now consider connected groups.\nLemma 3.3 Suppose \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n \u2208 Aut (K) are commuting automorphisms on a\ncompact connected group K. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. each \u03b1i is distal on K;\n2. the group generated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n is distal on K.\nProof Assume that each \u03b1i is distal on K. Let \u0393 be the group generated by\n\u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n . Let x \u2208 K be such that e is in the closure of \u0393(x). Let T be a maximal\npro-torus in K containing x (cf. Theorem 9.32 of [HM]). Then Aut (K) = Inn (K)\u03a9\nwhere Inn (K) is the group of inner automorphisms of K and \u03a9 = {\u03c4 \u2208 Aut (K) |\n\u03c4 (T ) = T } (cf. Corollary 9.87 of [HM]). Let \u03b2i \u2208 \u03a9 be such that \u03b1i \u2208 Inn (K)\u03b2i .\nIf y \u2208 K is such that \u03b2ikn (y) \u2192 e, then for each n \u2265 1, \u03b1ikn = \u03c3kn \u03b2ikn for some\n\u03c3kn \u2208 Inn (K) as Inn (K) is normal in Aut (K). Since K is compact, Inn (K)\nis compact, hence by passing to a subsequence, if necessary, we may assume that\n\u03c3kn \u2192 \u03c3 \u2208 Inn (K) and hence \u03b1ikn (y) = \u03c3kn \u03b2ikn (y) \u2192 \u03c3(e) = e. Since \u03b1i is distal,\ny = e. Thus, \u03b2i is distal on K and hence in particular, \u03b2i is distal on T .\nLet \u03a9\u2032 be the group generated \u03b21 , * * * , \u03b2n . Since Inn (K) is normal, Inn (K)\u03a9\u2032 is a\ngroup containing \u03b1i . Also \u03a9\u2032 \u2282 Inn (K)\u0393, we get that Inn (K)\u0393 = Inn (K)\u03a9\u2032 . This\nimplies that\n\u03a9\u2032 /Inn (K) \u2229 \u03a9\u2032 \u2243 Inn (K)\u03a9\u2032 /Inn (K) \u2243 \u0393Inn (K)/Inn (K) \u2243 \u0393/\u0393 \u2229 Inn (K).\nSince \u0393 is abelian, \u03a9\u2032 /Inn (K) \u2229 \u03a9\u2032 is abelian. It follows since each \u03b2i is distal on T\nand from Lemma 3.2 that \u03a9\u2032 is distal on T .\nSince e is in the closure of \u0393(x), there exists \u03b7n \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03b7n (x) \u2192 e. Since\n\u0393 \u2282 Inn (K)\u03a9\u2032 , there exist \u03c4n \u2208 Inn (K) and \u03b3n \u2208 \u03a9\u2032 such that \u03b7n = \u03c4n \u03b3n . Since\nInn (K) is compact, we may assume by passing to a subsequence, if necessary that\n\u03c4n \u2192 \u03c4 \u2208 Inn (K). Then \u03b3n (x) = \u03c4n\u22121 (\u03b7n (x)) \u2192 \u03c4 \u22121 (e) = e. Since x \u2208 T , \u03b3n \u2208 \u03a9\u2032\nand \u03a9\u2032 is distal on T , we get that x = e. This shows that \u0393 is distal on K\nWe now consider the general case.\nLemma 3.4 Suppose \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n \u2208 Aut (K) are commuting automorphisms on a\ncompact group K. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. each \u03b1i is distal on K;\n9\n\n\f2. the group generated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n is distal on K.\nProof Suppose each \u03b1i is distal on K. Let \u0393 be the group generated by \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n .\nLet x \u2208 K be such that e is in the closure of \u0393(x). Let K0 be the connected component of e in K. Then K0 is a closed normal \u0393-invariant subgroup of K and K/K0\nis a zero-dimensional compact group. Each \u03b1i is distal on K implies that each \u03b1i is\ndistal on K/K0 . It follows from Lemma 3.1 that \u0393 is distal on K/K0 . Since e is in\nthe closure of \u0393(x), x \u2208 K0 . Now it follows from Lemma 3.3 that x = e.\nThe following example shows that Lemma 3.4 is not true for any acting group.\nExample 3.1 Let M be any compact group and \u0393 be a countably infinite group.\nConsider the shift action of \u0393 on M \u0393 defined for \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 and f \u2208 M \u0393 by \u03b1f (\u03b2) =\nf (\u03b1\u22121\u03b2) for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393. Suppose f \u2208 M \u0393 is such that f (\u03b2) is identity in M for all\nbut finitely many \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393. We claim that identity in M \u0393 is a limit point of \u0393(f ). Let\n\u03b21 , * * * , \u03b2n be such that f (\u03b2) is identity in M if \u03b2 6= \u03b2i . Let U be a neighborhood of\nidentity in M. Then for any \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1m , since \u0393 is infinite, there is a \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that\n\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1i 6\u2208 {\u03b2i } and hence \u03b1f (\u03b1i ) \u2208 U. This shows that the shift action of \u0393 on M \u0393 is\nnot distal. If we choose \u0393 to be finitely generated, infinite and torsion, we get that\neach \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 is distal but \u0393 is not distal (cf. [Go] for existence of such \u0393.)\n\n4\n\nBerend's Theorem\n\nWe now prove Berend's Theorem for ergodic Zd -actions on compact groups provided\nthat center of the action has DCC.\nTheorem 4.1 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a finitely generated abelian group\nof automorphisms of K. Suppose \u0393 is ergodic on K and Z(\u0393) has DCC on K. Then\nthere exists \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03b1 is ergodic on K. Furthermore, if \u0393 is generated by\n\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n , then there exist positive integers i1 , * * * , in such that \u03b11i1 * * * \u03b1nin is ergodic\non K.\nWe need the following results.\nLemma 4.1 Let K be a compact group and \u03b1, \u03b2 be two commuting automorphisms\nof K. Suppose \u03b1 is ergodic on K and \u03b2 is distal on K. Then \u03b1i \u03b2 j is ergodic on K\nfor all integers i and j with i 6= 0.\nProof Since \u03b1i is ergodic on K for any i 6= 0 and \u03b2 j is distal on K for all j, it\nis sufficient to prove that \u03b1\u03b2 is ergodic on K. Applying Proposition 2.1 to \u03b1\u03b2 on\nK, we get that there exists a closed normal Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2282 Z(\u03b1\u03b2)-invariant subgroup K1\n10\n\n\fsuch that \u03b1\u03b2 is ergodic on K1 and \u03b1\u03b2 is distal on K/K1. Since \u03b1 and \u03b2 commute,\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Z(\u03b1, \u03b2), hence K1 is invariant under both \u03b1 and \u03b2. Since \u03b2 is distal on K, \u03b2\nis distal on K/K1 . By Lemma 3.4, the group generated by both \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2 is distal\non K/K1 . It is easy to see that \u03b1 is in the group generated by \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2, hence \u03b1\nis also distal on K/K1 but since \u03b1 is ergodic on K, \u03b1 is ergodic on K/K1 and hence\nK = K1 (cf. Proposition 2.1 of [Ra]).\nLemma 4.2 Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be two commuting automorphisms of K such that Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) has\nDCC. If \u03b1 is ergodic on K, then \u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic for all but finitely many i > 0.\nProof We first note that since \u03b1 and \u03b2 commute, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Z(\u03b1, \u03b2). Let K0 = K. We\nnow inductively construct a decreasing sequence (Ki )i\u22651 of Z(\u03b1, \u03b2)-invariant closed\nsubgroups such that Ki is normal in Ki\u22121 , \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki\u22121 /Ki for all j 6= i\nand \u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki .\nApplying Proposition 2.1 to \u03b1\u03b2 on K, we get that there exists Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2282 Z(\u03b1\u03b2)invariant closed subgroup K1 such that \u03b1\u03b2 is ergodic on K1 and \u03b1\u03b2 is distal on K/K1 .\nSince \u03b1 is ergodic on K, \u03b1 is ergodic on K/K1 and hence by Lemma 4.1, we get that\n\u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic on K/K1 for all i 6= 1.\nIf for j \u2264 i, Z(\u03b1, \u03b2)-invariant closed subgroups Kj are chosen so that \u03b1l \u03b2 is ergodic\non Kj\u22121 /Kj for all l 6= j and \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on Kj . We now choose Ki+1 . Applying\nProposition 2.1 to \u03b1i+1 \u03b2 on Ki , we get that there exists a Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2282 Z(\u03b1i+1 \u03b2)invariant normal subgroup Ki+1 of Ki such that \u03b1i+1 \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki+1 and distal\non Ki /Ki+1 . Since \u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki , \u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki /Ki+1 and hence \u03b2 \u22121\u03b1\u2212i is\nergodic on Ki /Ki+1 . Since \u03b1i+1 \u03b2 is distal Ki /Ki+1 , by Lemma 4.1, \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u22121 \u03b1\u2212i \u03b1i+1 \u03b2\nis ergodic on Ki /Ki+1 . Again by Lemma 4.1, we get that \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki /Ki+1\nfor all j 6= i + 1. Thus, there exists a decreasing sequence (Ki )i\u22651 of Z(\u03b1, \u03b2)-invariant\nclosed subgroups such that Ki is normal in Ki\u22121 , \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki\u22121 /Ki for all\nj 6= i and \u03b1i \u03b2 is ergodic on Ki .\nSince Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) has DCC on K, there exists a i such that Ki = Kj for all j > i.\nThis implies that for j > i, \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on Km\u22121 /Km for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 i and \u03b1j \u03b2 is\nergodic on Kj = Ki . Thus, by Lemma 2.2 we get that \u03b1j \u03b2 is ergodic on K for all\nj > i.\nProposition 4.1 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a finitely generated group of\ncommuting automorphisms of K generated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n . Then there exists a series\n(e) = K0 \u2282 K1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Kn \u2282 K of closed normal Z(\u0393)-invariant subgroups such that\n1. \u03b1i is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 and distal on K/Ki ,\n2. \u0393 is ergodic on Kn and distal on K/Kn .\nMoreover, if \u0393 is ergodic on K, K = Kn .\n11\n\n\fProof We first observe that since \u0393 is abelian, \u0393 \u2282 Z(\u0393) and hence any Z(\u0393)invariant subgroup is also \u0393-invariant. It follows from Proposition 2.1 that there\nexists a closed normal Z(\u0393) \u2282 Z(\u03b11 )-invariant subgroup K1 such that \u03b11 is ergodic\non K1 and distal on K/K1 . For i \u2265 1 and for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i, if closed normal Z(\u0393)invariant subgroups Kj are chosen such that \u03b1j is ergodic on Kj /Kj\u22121 and distal\non K/Kj . We now choose Ki+1 . Applying Proposition 2.1 to \u03b1i+1 on K/Ki , there\nexists a closed normal Z(\u0393) \u2282 Z(\u03b1i+1 )-invariant subgroup Ki+1 containing Ki such\nthat \u03b1i+1 is ergodic on Ki+1 /Ki and \u03b1i+1 is distal on K/Ki+1 . Thus, we have closed\nnormal Z(\u0393)-invariant subgroups (e) = K0 \u2282 K1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Kn \u2282 K such that \u03b1i is\nergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 and distal on K/Ki .\nSince \u03b1i \u2208 \u0393, \u0393 is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, hence by Lemma 2.2, \u0393\nis ergodic on Kn .\nSince K/Kn is a quotient of K/Ki for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, each \u03b1i is distal on K/Kn .\nThus by Lemma 3.4, \u0393 is distal on K/Kn .\nIf \u0393 is ergodic on K, then \u0393 is ergodic on K/Kn but \u0393 is distal on K/Kn , hence\nK = Kn (cf. Proposition 2.1 of [Ra]).\nProof of Theorem 4.1 Let \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * , \u03b1n \u2208 \u0393 be a set of generators of \u0393. The\nproof is by induction on n. Suppose \u0393 has more than one-generator. By Proposition\n4.1, there exist closed normal \u0393-invariant subgroups (e) = K0 \u2282 K1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Kn = K\nsuch that \u03b1i is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 and \u03b1i is distal on K/Ki .\nSince \u03b1n is ergodic on K/Kn\u22121 and \u03b1n\u22121 is distal on K/Kn\u22121, Lemma 4.1 implies\nj\nj\nis\nis ergodic on K/Kn\u22121 for all i and j with i 6= 0. In particular, \u03b1n \u03b1n\u22121\nthat \u03b1ni \u03b1n\u22121\nergodic on K/Kn\u22121 for all j.\nSince Z(\u0393) \u2282 Z(\u03b1n , \u03b1n\u22121 ), Z(\u03b1n , \u03b1n\u22121 ) has DCC on K. Since \u03b1n\u22121 is ergodic on\nj\nKn\u22121 /Kn\u22122 , applying Lemma 4.2 to \u03b1n\u22121 and \u03b1n on Kn\u22121 /Kn\u22122 , we get that \u03b1n \u03b1n\u22121\nj\nis ergodic\nis ergodic on Kn\u22121 /Kn\u22122 for all but finitely many j > 0. Since \u03b1n \u03b1n\u22121\nj\non K/Kn\u22121 for all j, we get that \u03b1n\u22121\n\u03b1n is ergodic on K/Kn\u22122 for some j > 0 (cf.\nLemma 2.2).\nj\nLet \u2206 be the group generated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1n\u22122 , \u03b1n\u22121\n\u03b1n . Then Z(\u2206) contains Z(\u0393)\nand hence Z(\u2206) has DCC on K. Since each \u03b1i is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 , we get that\n\u2206 is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2, hence by Lemma 2.2, \u2206 is ergodic\nj\non Kn\u22122 . Since \u03b1n\u22121\n\u03b1n is ergodic on K/Kn\u22122 , we get that \u2206 is ergodic on K (cf.\nLemma 2.2). Since \u2206 is generated by n \u2212 1 elements, result follows from induction\nassumption.\nThe next result is a consequence of a classical result of Rokhlin [Ro] and Theorem\n4.1.\n\n12\n\n\fCorollary 4.1 Let K be a compact group and \u0393 be a finitely generated group of\ncommuting automorphisms of K. Suppose Z(\u0393) has DCC on K. Then the following\nare equivalent:\n(1) \u0393 is ergodic on K;\n(2) there exists \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03b1 is mixing of all orders.\nThe following results and results in section 5 show that the additional condition\non Z(\u0393) in Theorem 4.1 is not restrictive.\nCorollary 4.2 Let K be a compact group. If the center of Aut (K) has DCC on K,\nthen any ergodic action of finitely generated abelian group contains ergodic automorphisms.\nProof Since the center of Aut (K) is contained in Z(\u0393) for any subgroup \u0393 of\nautomorphisms, Z(\u0393) has DCC on K if the center of Aut (K) has DCC on K. Now\nthe result follows from Theorem 4.1.\nLet M be a compact group and \u0393 be a countably infinite group. Consider the\nshift action of \u0393 on M \u0393 defined for \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 and f \u2208 M \u0393 by \u03b1f (\u03b2) = f (\u03b1\u22121 \u03b2) for all\n\u03b2 \u2208 \u0393. In this situation we have the following:\nTheorem 4.2 Let \u0393 be a finitely generated abelian group and M be a compact Lie\ngroup. Let K be a shift-invariant subgroup M \u0393 . Suppose the action of a finitely\ngenerated abelian group \u2206 on K commutes with the shift action of \u0393 on K. Then \u2206\nis ergodic on K implies that \u2206 contains ergodic automorphisms.\nProof By Theorem 3.2 of [KS] we get that the shift action of \u0393 has DCC on M \u0393\nand hence on K. Since the action of \u2206 on K commutes with the shift action on K,\nZ(\u2206) has DCC. Now the result follows from Theorem 4.1.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nSome compact abelian groups\nDuals of countable vector spaces\n\nLet F be a countable field with discrete topology. Let F\u2217 denote the multiplicative\ngroup of non-zero elements in F and Fr be the vector space over F of dimension r \u2265 1.\nThen Fr is countable discrete group. Let Kr be the dual of Fr . Then Kr is a compact\ngroup. Let AutF (Fr ) be the group of all F-linear transformation on Fr and AutF (Kr )\nbe the corresponding group of dual automorphisms on Kr . In this situation we have\nthe following:\n13\n\n\fTheorem 5.1 Let F be a countable field with discrete topology. Let Kr be the dual\nof Fr for some integer r > 0. Then we have the following:\n(1) the center of AutF (Kr ) has DCC;\n(2) if \u0393 is a finitely generated abelian subgroup of AutF (Kr ) such that \u0393 is ergodic,\nthen \u0393 contains ergodic automorphisms.\nRemark We will now show by an example that finite generation condition on \u0393 in\nTheorem 5.1 (2) can not be relaxed. Let p be a prime number. Then for any n \u2265 1,\nwe can find a unique finite field Fn with pn number of elements and Fn contains Fm if\nand only if m divides n (cf. Corollary 2, Section 1, Chapter 1, [We]). Let F = \u222a\u221e\nk=1 Fnk\nfor some fixed n > 1. Then F is a countably infinite field. Consider the F\u2217 -action on\nF by scalar multiplication. Then for any non-zero a \u2208 F, F \u2217 a is infinite. Thus, the\ndual action of F\u2217 on the dual K1 of F is ergodic but every element in F\u2217 has finite\norder and hence no element of F\u2217 is ergodic.\nProof Consider the F\u2217 -action on Fr given by q(qi ) = (qqi ) for all q \u2208 F\u2217 and\n(qi ) \u2208 Fr . It can be easily seen that F\u2217 is in the center of AutF (Fr ). If (Ln )\nis a decreasing sequence of closed subgroups in Kr that are F\u2217 -invariant, then let\nAn = {\u03c7 \u2208 Fr | \u03c7 is trivial on Ln }. Then (An ) is a increasing sequence of\nsubgroups of Fr that are F\u2217 - invariant. Since any subgroup that is F\u2217 -invariant is\na F-subspace of Fr , (An ) is a increasing sequence of F-subspaces of Fr . Since Fr is\nr /A ), we get that\nfinite dimensional, An = Am for all large n and m. Since Ln = (F\\\nn\nLn = Lm for all large n and m. Thus, the center of AutF (Kr ) has DCC on Kr .\nLet \u0393 be a finitely generated abelian subgroup of AutF (Kr ). Then Z(\u0393) contains\nthe center of AutF (Kr ). Since the center of AutF (Kr ) has DCC, we get that Z(\u0393)\nhas DCC. Now the result follows from Theorem 4.1.\nIf we take K = Q, we may obtain Berend's Theorem of [Be] for actions of automorphisms as shown below.\nTheorem 5.2 Let K be a compact connected finite-dimensional abelian group and \u0393\nbe a group of commuting automorphisms of K. If \u0393 is ergodic on K, then there exists\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03b1 is ergodic on K.\nProof Let K be a compact connected abelian group of finite-dimension. Let r be\nthe dimension of K. Let Br be the dual of the discrete group Qr . Then K is a\nquotient of Br and any automorphism of K lifts to an automorphism of Br . A group\nof automorphisms is ergodic on K if and only if the corresponding group of lifts is\nergodic on Br (cf. [Be] or [Ra]). Thus, we may assume that K = Br .\n14\n\n\fLet \u0393 be a group of commuting automorphisms of Br and \u0393 is ergodic on Br . By\nLemma 5.9 of [Ra], there exist a series (e) = K0 \u2282 K1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Km = Br of closed\nconnected \u0393-invariant subgroups with each Ki \u2243 Bri and automorphisms \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1m\nin \u0393 such that \u03b1i is ergodic on Ki /Ki\u22121 . This implies that the group generated by\n\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1m is ergodic on Km = Br (cf. Lemma 2.2). Thus, replacing \u0393 by its subgroup\ngenerated by \u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1m , if necessary, we may assume that \u0393 is a finitely generated\nabelian group.\nIt is easy to see that any homomorphism of Qr into Qr is a Q-linear transformation.\nThis shows that Aut (Br ) \u2243 AutQ (Br ). Now the result follows from Theorem 5.1.\nRemark Using the results proved here we can prove Theorem 5.2 for commuting\nsemigroup of epimorphisms of compact connected finite-dimensional abelian groups\n(as lifts of epimorphisms are automorphisms) which would retrieve Berends result\nin its full generality but as this would cause a digression we would not go into the\ndetails.\n\n5.2\n\nDuals of modules\n\nWe now discuss compact abelian groups arising as duals of modules over rings: see\n[Sh] for any details on rings and modules. Let R be a commutative ring and for\n\u00b11\nany d \u2265 1, let R = Rd = R[u\u00b11\n1 , * * * , ud ] be the ring of Laurent polynomials in the\ncommuting variables u1 , * * * , ud with coefficients in R. Let M be a R-module. Let\nX M be the dual of M. Then X M is a compact abelian group.\nFor n = (n1 , * * * , nd ) \u2208 Zd we define an automorphism \u03b1n of M by\n\u03b1n a = un1 1 . . . und d a\nfor all a \u2208 M. By considering the dual we obtain an automorphism \u03b1n of X M . It\ncan be easily seen that n 7\u2192 \u03b1n defines a Zd -action on X M .\nSuppose the additive structure of R is cyclic. Then it can be easily seen that the\nafore-defined Zd -action has DCC on X M if and only if M is a Noetherian R-module:\na module A over a ring Q is called a Noetherian module if any increasing sequence\nA1 \u2282 A2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 An \u2282 An+1 \u2282 * * * of submodules is finite, that is, An = Am for large\nn and m and a ring Q is called a Noetherian ring if Q is a Noetherian Q-module.\nIf R = Z, Theorem 11.2 of [KS] proved that Zd -action defined as above has DCC\non X M if (and only if) M is a finitely generated R-module. Theorem 3.3 of [Sc1] has\nshown that if R = Z, M is a finitely generated R-module and the Zd -action defined\nas above is ergodic on X M , then there is a n such that \u03b1n is ergodic on X M . In this\nrespect we prove the following using Theorem 4.1 when the additive group structure\nof R is a cyclic group.\n15\n\n\fTheorem 5.3 Assume that the additive group structure of R is cyclic and M is a\nfinitely generated R-module. Then we have the following:\n(1) {\u03b1n | n \u2208 Zd } has DCC on X M ;\n(2) if \u0393 is a finitely generated abelian group of R-module homomorphisms of M and\nthe dual action of \u0393 is ergodic on X M , then there is a \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that the dual\naction of \u03b1 is ergodic on X M .\nRemark If we take R = Z and \u0393 = {\u03b1n | n \u2208 Zd }, we retrieve Theorem 3.3 of [Sc1].\nProof We first claim that M is Noetherian. Since the additive structure of R is\ncyclic, R is either finite or R = Z, hence R is Noetherian. By Hilbert's Basis Theorem,\nthe polynomial ring R[X1 , * * * , Xd , Y1 , * * * , Yd ] is also Noetherian (cf. 8.7 and 8.8 of\n[Sh]). Let f : R[X1 , * * * , Xd , Y1 , * * * , Yd ] \u2192 R be the map defined f (Xi ) = ui and\nf (Yi ) = u\u22121\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d. Then f is a surjective ring homomorphism and hence\ni\nby Lemma 8.2 of [Sh], we get that R is a Noetherian ring. Since M is a finitely\ngenerated R-module, we get from Corollary 7.22 (i) of [Sh] that M is Noetherian.\nSince Zd -action having DCC on X M is equivalent to M being Noetherian, (1) is\nproved.\nLet \u03b1 be a R-module homomorphism. Then for any n = (n1 , * * * , nd ) \u2208 Zd ,\n\u03b1\u03b1n (a) = \u03b1(un1 1 * * * und d a) = un1 1 * * * und d \u03b1(a) = \u03b1n \u03b1(a)\nfor all a \u2208 M. Thus, Z(\u0393) contains all \u03b1n and hence by (1), Z(\u0393) has DCC. Now (2)\nfollows from Theorem 4.1.\nRemark Let M be free R-module of rank k (we may take M to be direct sum of\nk-copies of R). Then the group of invertible R-module homomorphisms of M, can\nbe realized as invertible matrices with coefficients from the ring R. Thus, \u0393 in (2) of\nTheorem 5.3 may be taken as a finitely generated abelian group of invertible matrices\nwith coefficients from R.\nWe now give one more variation of examples considered in [KS]. Let F be a\n\u00b11\ncountable field and for any d \u2265 1, let S = F[u\u00b11\n1 , * * * , ud ] be the ring of Laurent\npolynomials in the commuting variables u1 , * * * , ud with coefficients in F. Let N be a\nS-module. Let K N be the dual of N . Then K N is a compact abelian group.\nConsider the Zd -action defined as above, that is, for any n = (n1 , * * * , nd ) \u2208 Zd we\ndefine an automorphism \u03b1n of N by\n\u03b1n a = un1 1 . . . und d a\nfor all a \u2208 N .\n16\n\n\fLet \u2206 = F\u2217 \u00d7 Zd . For (q, n) \u2208 \u2206 = F\u2217 \u00d7 Zd , we define \u03b1(q,n) by\n\u03b1(q,n) (a) = q\u03b1n a\nfor all a \u2208 N . By considering the dual, we get an automorphism of K N . Thus, we\nget an action of \u2206 on K N .\nIt can be easily seen that \u2206 having DCC on K N is equivalent to N being a\nNoetherian S-module. In this situation we have the following.\nTheorem 5.4 Suppose N is finitely generated as a S-module. Then we have the\nfollowing:\n(1) \u2206 has DCC on K N , the dual of N .\n(2) If \u0393 is a finitely generated abelian group of S-module homomorphisms of N and\nthe dual action of \u0393 is ergodic on K N , then there is a \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that the dual\naction of \u03b1 is ergodic on K N .\n(3) If \u0393 = {\u03b1n | n \u2208 Zd }, then the dual action of \u0393 is ergodic on K N implies that\nthere is a n \u2208 Zd such that the dual action of \u03b1n is ergodic on K N .\nProof Since \u2206 having DCC on K N is equivalent to N being Noetherian, it is\nsufficient to show that N is a Noetherian module over the ring S if N is finitely\ngenerated.\nSince F is a field, it is easy to see that F is a Noetherian ring as F is the only nonzero ideal. By Hilbert's Basis Theorem, the polynomial ring F [X1 , * * * , Xd , Y1, * * * , Yd ]\nis also Noetherian (cf. 8.7 and 8.8 of [Sh]). Now Xi 7\u2192 ui and Yi 7\u2192 u\u22121\ni induces a ring\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\nhomomorphism of F [X1 , * * * , Xd , Y1, * * * , Yd ] onto S = F[u1 , * * * , ud ] and hence by\nLemma 8.2 of [Sh], we get that S is a Noetherian ring. Since N is a finitely generated\nS-module, Corollary 7.22 (i) of [Sh] implies that N is Noetherian. This proves (1).\nIt is easy to see that any S-module homomorphism commutes with \u2206-action and\nhence by (1) Z(\u0393) has DCC if \u0393 is a group of S-module homomorphisms. Thus, (2)\nfollows from Theorem 4.1.\nSince each \u03b1n is a S-module homomorphism, (3) follows from (2).\nWe would like to note that compact groups considered in Theorem 5.1 are finitedimensional whereas compact groups considered in this subsection need not be of\nfinite-dimension. In fact, if R = Z or F = Q and modules are free-modules, then\ncompact groups in Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 are infinite-dimensional.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[BW]\n\nU.Baumgartner and G.
