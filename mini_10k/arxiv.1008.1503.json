We say that G has spread r if for any set of distinct non-trivial elements\nX := {x1 , . . . , xr } \u2282 G# there exists an element y \u2208 G with the property that hxi , yi = G for every\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. We say that y is a mate to X. We say G has exact spread r := s(G) if G has spread r but not\nr + 1.\nThis concept was first introduced by Brenner and Wiegold in [4], extending earlier work of\nBinder in [1]. The concept of spread may be thought of as a generalization of the idea of 3/2generation.\nSince this note is not intended for publication, we omit background and motivation, but the\ninterested reader may wish to consult [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The reader should at least note that\nthere has been considerable interest in determining, or at least bounding, the exact spreads of the\nfinite simple groups and in particular the exact spreads of the sporadic simple groups. The precise\nvalue of the exact spread of a finite simple group is known in very few cases. Here we prove the\nfollowing.\nTheorem 1.1. s(M23 ) = 8064\n\n2 Proof of Theorem 1\nProof. First note that from [7, Table 1] (itself a heavily corrected version of [2, Table 1]) we have that\ns(M23 ) \u2264 8064 and so it is sufficient to show that any set of 8064 elements from M#23 has a mate. Let\nX \u2282 M23 be a set of 8064 distinct elements.\nNow, from the maximal subgroups of M23 listed in [6, p.71] we see that an element of order\n23 is contained in only one maximal subgroup - a copy of the Frobenius group 23:11. Since the\nnormalizer in M23 of a cyclic subgroup of order 11 is a Frobenius group 11:5, each element of order\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBen Fairbairn\n\n11 is contained in five disctinct copies of 23:11. It follows that the only way X can avoid having a\nmate of order 23 is if X consists of a well chosen configutation of elements of order 11.\nFinally, note that of the maximal subgroups of M23 containing elements of order 11, which are\neach isomorphic to one of M22 , M11 or 23:11, none contain elements of order 14. It follows that even\nif X only contains elements of order 11, X must have a mate and so s(M23 ) \u2265 8064.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] G.J.
